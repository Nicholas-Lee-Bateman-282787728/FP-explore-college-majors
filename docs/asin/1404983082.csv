168972,A3PZR5NI1EGMP1,1404983082,"A. Cooper ""possum""","[3, 5]","First the good stuff: the film's soundtrack is beautiful and haunting, and the visuals are absolutely mesmerizing. Ditto for the costuming; I've never seen such stunning and intricate fabrics. And the acting by pretty much the entire cast is first-rate.Here's the problem: while you are given a good idea of what the life of a geisha was like, I think I saw the same storyline on the second season of Dynasty. The scheming! The backstabbing! The hair-pulling cat fights! (what -- no swimming pool to fall into? Ah, well.) And all for the love of a man. Egad. I was actually more interested in the minor role of Sayuri's only friend Pumpkin; groomed to become a geisha herself, she is usurped by the young girl (Sayuri) she once helped. On the other hand, she probably never would have made geisha; when you're dumpy, uncoordinated, and named after an oversized squash, you're pretty much screwed.So there you have it. If you're a sucker for a decidedly non-feminist love story, with fantastic scoring and cinematography, then get this film. It's a bon-bon of a guilty treat; just don't be disappointed when you bite into the lovely chocolate and find it all gooey inside.",3,"If You Knew Sayuri, Like I Knew Sayuri...",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1171,"['First', 'good', 'stuff', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'beautiful', 'haunting', 'visuals', 'are', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'Ditto', 'costuming', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'stunning', 'intricate', 'fabrics', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'entire', 'cast', 'first-rate.Here', 'problem', 'are', 'given', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'life', 'geisha', 'was', 'think', 'saw', 'same', 'storyline', 'second', 'season', 'Dynasty', 'scheming', 'backstabbing', 'hair-pulling', 'cat', 'fights', 'what', 'swimming', 'pool', 'fall', 'Ah', 'well', 'love', 'man', 'Egad', 'was', 'actually', 'more', 'interested', 'minor', 'role', 'Sayuri', 'only', 'friend', 'Pumpkin', 'groomed', 'become', 'geisha', 'herself', 'usurped', 'young', 'girl', 'Sayuri', 'once', 'helped', 'other', 'hand', 'probably', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'geisha', 'when', ""'re"", 'dumpy', 'uncoordinated', 'named', 'oversized', 'squash', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'much', 'screwed.So', 'there', 'have', ""'re"", 'sucker', 'decidedly', 'non-feminist', 'love', 'story', 'fantastic', 'scoring', 'cinematography', 'then', 'get', 'film', 'bon-bon', 'guilty', 'treat', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'when', 'bite', 'lovely', 'chocolate', 'find', 'gooey', 'inside']",N/A
168973,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,1404983082,A Customer,"[0, 0]","Memoirs of a Geisha is about as Japanese as one of those imitation hand painted silk screens that you can buy from Ikea. That's not to say that Rob Marshall's latest directing effort isn't beautiful to watch, because it is; it's just that visual sumptuous has trumped dramatic intent, consequently the move is not so much directed as designed - talk about a hatchet job on one of the most beloved works of contemporary literary fiction.This film is a big misfire for Rob Marshall, it's as though his heart either wasn't in the movie, or he somehow let the movie get away from him. Whatever way you look at it, the film that Marshall has made from Golden's novel is a snooze, a bore of the biggest kind. There's plenty of potential spectacle and melodrama in Memoirs of a Geisha - rows of gorgeous geisha trainees dancing with their fans, a whole town of low, cedar-and-bamboo buildings with mountains in the distance, evocative lamps casting furtive glows over village streets, lovely orange blossom trees everywhere you look.But in the end it's all a bit much, because what we're presented with is a kind of crude fairy tale, in which a country girl, Chiyo, is sold into bondage at a Kyoto geisha house in 1929. The house is ruled by a Cinderella-like wicked stepmother and stepsister, the foul-tempered Mother (Kaori Momoi) and a nasty head geisha, Hatsumomo (Gong Li) a Cinderella-like wicked stepmother and stepsister. Eventually the teen-age Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang) is rescued by Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), an older geisha, who treats her kindly and teaches her the intricacies of her craft.Marshall attempts to give us bits and pieces of geisha lore, provided in a voice over. Sayuri's virginity is sold in a high-class raffle; the women accompany men to sumo matches; they wrap themselves in beautiful kimonos and constantly paint themselves with white powder. A subplot involves two of the film's men: Watanabe's character and his loyal associate (Koji Yakusho), a man who saved his life during combat in Manchuria and was left with a scarred face.Geisha hots up when the intrigues among the women reach their height, and you almost can forgive the movie's lack of drive, its intermittent dullness and its tendency to indulge in Hollywood melodramatics, and it doesn't help that only about a quarter of the cast actually looks Japanese.  Marshall just can't keep the lack-luster narrative flowing or create interest in any of his characters.Also, we never discover why Hatsumomo is so cruel to Chiyo, and by the time we find out we no longer care. As Hatsumomo, Gong Li is required to throw so lots of temper tantrums, but she behaves less like a cultured geisha and more like a spoiled little brat.The acting in all the major roles is passable, with all the actresses looking exquisite. Zhang is a standout encapsulating all the shyness and uncertainty of her character, coupled the defiance and iron will. Yeoh brings just the right dignity and cautious calculation to the role of Sayuri's mentor. Gong puts the necessary gorgeous devilishness into the hateful Hatsumomo.The movie actually picks up a bit during it's final third, where it rushes through the war and occupation, yet it even makes the war look glamorous. Overall, the film is just so flat and anti-climatic, and at nearly two and a half hours, you know you have a problem when the storyline, the characters, and the themes of Geishas in the depression era, are upstaged by the constant onslaught of glamorous clothes and gorgeous sets.

168974,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,1404983082,Alistair McHarg,"[2, 3]","Memoirs of a Geisha is best appreciated at face value, a meticulously crafted, sumptuous visual feast that does not withstand too much editorial scrutiny.  The narrator describes a geisha as a ""moving work of art,"" which is telling, because a geisha's personality is, by definition, not particularly important.  In the film's most glorious scene, Sayuri's debut, we witness the poetry of Kabuki, a beautiful and fragile illusion that celebrates artifice.  Another captivating scene, Chiyo's introduction to the clothes, make-up, and mannerisms that make a geisha, also reveals that image, not content, is paramount.  So is it with this film.Detractors will find much to criticize, if so inclined.  For one, there are almost no Japanese cast members, thereby throwing claims of authenticity into a cocked hat.  For another, the film is ostensibly powered by a love story, and at almost two-and-a-half hours one would certainly expect some sort of forceful driving theme.  But Chiyo/Sayuri harbors only a schoolgirl infatuation and the contrived Hollywood ending is not at all in keeping with the film's generally dark perspective.  Instead of the terrible, transformational behemoth it actually was, WWII is treated like a minor character introduced in order to drop off a plot point.  These criticisms are justified, but miss the point.Far more interesting is the depiction of geisha life itself, something almost ""totally other,"" and very unfamiliar to the Western mind.  The profoundly disturbing origins are not far from slavery, we think of poor Chiyo as a little girl torn away from her fishing village.  But comparisons to prostitution are misguided; indeed, geisha life seems to celebrate all the ""female virtues"" valued by this culture except sex - grace, beauty, tact, deference, wit, talent, gentility.  As Westerners in an era of feminism we are quick to condemn turning a person into a ""moving work of art,"" and we are right to do so, but geisha life is still a fascinating bit of cultural anthropology.The performances are uniformly wonderful, characterized by splendid restraint and control.  Sets, costumes, and especially cinematography are all inspired.  Memoirs of a Geisha may have flaws, but if you look beyond them, it's a treat.

The love story is pure and beautiful, rife with angst, and Zhang and Watanabe have beautiful chemistry.  Michelle Yeoh also gives her all to her character.  The cinematography, sets, costuming, and soundtrack all conspire to create an excellent film mood evoking emotion/empathy from its audience, but certain things just irritated me such as:[WARNING!  SPOILERS!!!]1.  The opening scenes are done in Japanese without subtitles.  Perhaps this is to further promote the atmosphere of trauma/stress to Chiyo and Satsu's plight, but I am shallow enough to have preferred to know what people were actually saying to each other.2.  Matsumomo (portrayed by Gong Li) is a villainess so over the top she lost credibility with me (I'm a Li fan, by the way and her name in the cast weighed my decision to purchase the film.)  Her actions go beyond rivalry or primadonna-ness.  She is a sociopath with no real motives for her saddistic behavior.  She seems purely evil to me.3.  I can't see Chiyo/Sayuri willingly accepting ""Mother's"" adoption of her after the excessive emotional and physical abuse she endured throughout her childhood and young adulthood.  I realise it's a different time and culture but I don't care.  ""Mother"" was a cruel idiot.4.  Pumpkin's betrayal of Sayuri near the tale's end is another bizarre inconsistency.

168981,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1404983082,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","There is no denying that `Memoirs of a Geisha' is a beautiful film.  It won, and rightfully so, the Oscars for cinematography, costume design and art direction.  The problem though lies deeper than that.  You know the saying that beauty is only skin deep?  Well, `Memoirs of a Geisha' plays to that phrase, relying on outward beauty rather than building a deep-seated emotional response to the characters within the story.  Sadly I felt disconnected from everyone and so when the movie was over, sure I liked it, but I didn't adore it as I could and should have.  Moments of `Geisha' are magical, but more often than not it's just a pretty film, nothing more nothing less.The story behind `Memoirs' has everything a sweeping epic needs to survive.  It's the touching story of young Chiyo, a little girl separated from her sister and sold to a geisha house to serve out her years as a maid.  One day she meets the charming Chairman, a man much older than her but one that leaves a lasting impression.  Chiyo, in love with this man and determined to one day be by his side, sets out to become a geisha herself so she will have the opportunity to love him to the full.  This does not sit well with rival geisha Hatsumomo who loathes the progress and attention Chiyo (now named Sayuri) is getting.  With the help of Mameha, Sayuri becomes one of the most desired geisha's in the land but she soon realizes that what she once considered a dream has turned into a curse for as a geisha she is not allowed to follow her heart.I said that this was a touching story, and from all respectable areas it is but it fails to truly touch the audience.  Despite the fact that Sayuri's story is moving she fails to move us.  I think that this has a lot to do with Ziyi Zhang underwhelming performance.  She is a beautiful and talented young actress but this performance is far beneath her.  I never truly believed her as Sayuri, never felt her determination, her desperation, her longing.  In fact, each emotion felt forced or coerced, and if she was being coached through each scene, never truly living and breathing her character.  The rest of the cast delivers beautifully but the bulk of the film rests on Zhang's shaky shoulders and so it fails to reel us in.Michelle Yeoh and Gong Li on the other hand are wonderfully cast and deliver effortless and captivating performances.  If Gong Li had received the lead role here I feel that this film could have reached a much higher audience and received much more awards attention.  Her performance as the jealous and spiteful Hatsumomo is deliciously captivating.Rob Marshall, the Oscar nominated director of `Chicago' seems like the perfect choice to direct this film, and quite frankly he did a masterful job.  It's a shame that his lead actress failed to deliver at the level she should have.  He could have had yet another Best Picture frontrunner on his hands, but alas, he created a truly gorgeous film; and at least he won some well deserved Oscars (or at least his film did) and that's something to be proud of.",3,A beautiful film that fails to manifest any real inner beauty...,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,3052,"['denying', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'beautiful', 'film', 'won', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Oscars', 'cinematography', 'costume', 'design', 'art', 'direction', 'problem', 'deeper', 'know', 'saying', 'beauty', 'only', 'skin', 'deep', 'Well', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'plays', 'phrase', 'relying', 'outward', 'beauty', 'rather', 'building', 'deep-seated', 'emotional', 'response', 'characters', 'story', 'Sadly', 'felt', 'disconnected', 'everyone', 'so', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'sure', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'adore', 'could', 'should', 'have', 'Moments', 'Geisha', 'are', 'magical', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'just', 'pretty', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'nothing', 'less.The', 'story', 'Memoirs', 'everything', 'sweeping', 'epic', 'needs', 'survive', 'touching', 'story', 'young', 'Chiyo', 'little', 'girl', 'separated', 'sister', 'sold', 'geisha', 'house', 'serve', 'out', 'years', 'maid', 'One', 'day', 'charming', 'Chairman', 'man', 'much', 'older', 'one', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Chiyo', 'love', 'man', 'determined', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'side', 'out', 'become', 'geisha', 'herself', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'love', 'full', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'rival', 'geisha', 'Hatsumomo', 'who', 'progress', 'attention', 'Chiyo', 'now', 'named', 'Sayuri', 'getting', 'help', 'Mameha', 'Sayuri', 'one', 'most', 'desired', 'geisha', 'land', 'soon', 'what', 'once', 'considered', 'dream', 'turned', 'curse', 'geisha', 'not', 'allowed', 'follow', 'heart.I', 'said', 'was', 'touching', 'story', 'respectable', 'areas', 'truly', 'audience', 'fact', 'Sayuri', 'story', 'moving', 'move', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'underwhelming', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'young', 'actress', 'performance', 'far', 'beneath', 'never', 'truly', 'believed', 'Sayuri', 'never', 'felt', 'determination', 'desperation', 'longing', 'fact', 'emotion', 'felt', 'forced', 'coerced', 'was', 'being', 'coached', 'scene', 'never', 'truly', 'living', 'breathing', 'character', 'rest', 'cast', 'delivers', 'beautifully', 'bulk', 'film', 'rests', 'Zhang', 'shaky', 'shoulders', 'so', 'reel', 'in.Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'Gong', 'Li', 'other', 'hand', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'deliver', 'effortless', 'captivating', 'performances', 'Gong', 'Li', 'had', 'received', 'lead', 'role', 'here', 'feel', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'reached', 'much', 'higher', 'audience', 'received', 'much', 'more', 'awards', 'attention', 'performance', 'jealous', 'spiteful', 'Hatsumomo', 'deliciously', 'captivating.Rob', 'Marshall', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'director', 'Chicago', 'perfect', 'choice', 'direct', 'film', 'quite', 'frankly', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'shame', 'lead', 'actress', 'failed', 'deliver', 'level', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'yet', 'Best', 'Picture', 'frontrunner', 'hands', 'alas', 'created', 'truly', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'least', 'won', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'least', 'film', 'did', 'something', 'be', 'proud']",N/A

168983,A1FE06N5A77K8W,1404983082,Annie Feng,"[6, 14]","Let me just tell you right now that I'm Chinese, so naturally I do have some feeling and biase over the fact that Chinese actors playing Japanese people, but when I saw the movie, let me just tell ya, THAT, and the fact that the movie was filmed into English are THE LEAST of the problems with this movie.the problem is, except for the overall story structure, NONE, I meant NONE of the plot, storylines, characters followed the book. The overall structure I meant is only this: this person met that person, they went that place, the ending, they did this (in the simplest sense you could ever explain it to someone). No details followed the true storyline, and the movie destroyed the book soooo bad that I was literally cringing through the entire movie praying it to end so I don't have to see anymore destruction of the book. Did Marshall read the book at all?? or did he just listened to someone telling him briefully what happened? 'cause that's the feeling I'm getting. Let me just tell you now, whoever actually read the book and said that the movie followed the book well are those people who have read it long time ago and have pretty much forgotten most of the details. I guarrantee ya no one, I mean NO ONE who has the story freshly in his/her mind is gonna say this is a good movie that followed the book well. I read the book just before going to see the movie, I thought that I'm only gonna be bothered by the ethnicity fact and the English thing, boy was I wrong. My advice to you guys is: only go see the movie if: you haven't read the book and is not going to anytime soon, or you read it a long time ago and have forgotten most of it. I was VERY sorry I read the book, otherwise I might have enjoyed it better.of all the wrong things, why oh why did they have to start with the characters???? Sayuri is gentle and obedient ALWAYS except for the escape and the dissing Nobu thing. She will NEVER say anything (let alone YELLING in the Okiya)unless told to, and is like this from the BEGINNING. Who is that rebellious, big-mouthed, loud girl??? Mameha is strict, cunning and lady-like woman, not the nice-like-Sayuri's-mother-person. Even though Mameha is Sayuri's sister, they NEVER had that sister-like relationship, it's always a teacher-student relationship, Sayuri always follows her order without questions. Hatsumomo is devious in a psychotic, brilliant way, not the crazed woman portrayed in the movie, in the book whenever you see her your heart beats hard in worry that she will bring down major destruction. Gong Li might have done a really good job playing her, but overall, she's not EVIL enough. The Chairman is always very cold and avoidant to Sayuri, the change in the movie is obviously American adapted- that they just HAVE to show affection for one another to be convincing. In the book the fact that the Chairman actually loved Sayuri is the biggest surprise of all, not the always-smiling nice guy in the movie. Nobu is the most dissappointing of all. He is suppose to be a hard-hearted, mean person but deep down has a soft spot. But in the movie he is pretty much just as nice as Chairman, WHAT!!!! The baron is barely mentioned, and he is supposed to be a lusty guy always craving women's flesh, but in the movie can you ACTUALLY tell if you didn't see the forcing Sayuri to undress scene? Pumpkin is another major dissappointment, she is suppose to be a very innocent sweet but very sad girl, not the sluttish drunkard portrayed in the movie. Last but not least the Cornnel, he is NOT an American, okay? he is supposed to be a Japanese, in fact, none of the Geisha knew English well enough to conversate, regardless of the invasion.As for the scenes, if I point out every single one of them I would've given you the entire movie. But the most obvious ones are: the start of the apprentice-people don't notice apprentices, they're not suppose to do ANYTHING but pour tea, let alone DANCE; The major dance Sayuri did was WRONG, she's suppose to do a cheerful one(the girl falling in love with a dolphine, which by the way, isn't played by only one person), she didn't do that one until much later, and in a private party; Hatsumomo did not cat-fight with Sayuri, nor did she set the Okiya on fire, Hatsumomo was kicked-out by the cunning plans of Mameha, with the already-learned Sayuri's help. Sayuri did not ""apologize"" to Pumpkin, Pumpkin is in fact, leading a very sad and poor life after Hatsumomo got kicked out and Sayuri helped her by asking her to come with her to a party; Last but not least Nobu DID bid for Sayuri, but he just didn't continue his bid because of his personal construct, and Dr.Crab did actually win, not by the help of Mameha(who by the way, never told Sayuri the truth). And where is the General?? Sayuri's first Danna???the Novel is in every way a masterpiece, it's actually one of the few I've read that really touched me in its non-cliche, revolutionary ideas- that women are only toys to men, and love is but a illusion, it does not really exist. In fact, in the movie it never mentioned that Chairman is in fact, married. this is a typical Hollywood adapted movie- lovers in the end end well. Whilce when I finished the book, even though I felt happy for Sayuri, I also felt very sorry for the wives of the men, who you can just imagine must be very heart-broken to hear their husbands have mistresses. Guess what they do to try to fill that gap? they had the narration of Sayuri to say: ""this is not the story of an empress, or a queen, but the story of a Geisha"" I nearly laughed at this stupid mending if it weren't for my desperately wanting to escape the theatre. Let me just ask: what's the point of making this movie if you can't even spread the original message well?So did ANYTHING go right? Well, it would be unfair to say no. the visuals were great, the actors are generally well-chosen. Even though I feel that Gong Li is too old for this role. I know Asian people have a good tendency to stay looking as long as ten years younger than their actually age. But seriously, Gong Li is at least 40, acting someone who's from 15 to 25? there is still a big difference. Zhang ZiYi is okay, I felt she's too mean and rebellious- looking to be Sayuri, probably because all her previous films she's always playing a mean, rebellious or evil girl. Michell Yeoh is okay too, but she definitely does NOT look like how she's described in the book. in the book Mameha has PERFECT features, she has perfect oval face, perfect symmetrical eyes etc. But the two scene I felt they've done right are: 1. the Mizuga scene, the book was VERY descriptive of the sex, I was actually halleluja-ing when I saw that we didn't get to see it; 2. and the best one- the scene where Sayuri was narrating, and you see blood in the river, or you thought it was blood, but it turns out to be the dyes flowing from the fabrics, that was BEAUTIFUL in a very symbolic, metaphoric way. If the movie is worth anything, that was IT.Lastly I just wanna say a few things about the controversial issue: I don't care about the whole Chinese people acting Japanese, probably because I was so pissed about this entire movie that I overlooked it. But as long as they find good actors, I've got no problem with it. As for the whole thing in English part, I actually thought that was done right. Because the book was WRITTEN in English so to translate the whole thing in Japanese, is that really a good idea?? don't know, it might destroy the flavor from the book (but of course that they already accomplished *heavy sigh*), the English, since it was spoken slowly since the actors weren't native speakers, actually made me understand better than most other movies I've seen without subtitles. Usually I need subtitles 'cause people in the movies spoke too fast and all the echoes from the movie made it worse. But this time I could understand every word.Of course you are gonna say to me that of course I didn't like the movie 'cause I read the book, that's just like every other book-adapted movie there is. But that's just not true. I've read Pride and Prejudice and felt the movie (the newest one) was good; I've read The Lord of The Rings Trilogy and loved the movies (all three of them), I've read Harry Potter and the movie was very well adapted from the book (the reason I didn't enjoy it that MUCH is only because I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter, but the movies are nowhere near as bad as this one); I've read a Walk to Remember and the movie was pretty good, even though Mandy Moore can't act I'm sorry to say. I could go on and on. Believe me, I'm not biased over books to movies, this one really IS the worst novel-adapted movie I have EVER seen. If it weren't for Marshall's Chicago, which I loved, I wanted to go kill him right now for destroying such an exquisic book.",2,God did Marshal ACTUALLY read the book???!!!!,1139011200,"02 4,

168984,AHKP7P4T2QDU5,1404983082,Aubrey Ward III,"[6, 9]","I loved it! It was like seeing my imagination on screen in living color. What I pictured while reading the book was translated perfectly into this film. I had doubts about this film until I saw the cast and then I was totally committed to buying a ticket. I love Asian cinema so a film featuring heavy hitters like Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh is not just a movie, it's an event! The actors portray their characters near book perfect. Zhang Ziyi (Sayuri) is fragile but tough. Michelle Yeoh (Mameha) is the wise big sister who hides tons of fierceness behind a veil of quiet elegance. Gong Li (Hatsumomo) was so ruthless and looked gorgeous while tormenting those around her. And one of the most distingushed of actors portraying the most distingushed of characters; Ken Wantanabe (The Chairman). And I gotta give a shout-out to Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa who plays ""The Baron"". I've been a fan of his since ""Mortal Kombat"" and it was a real treat to see him in this great production.The film itself was very good. I think it was pretty faithful to the essence of the book which is the journey of this peasant girl to reknowned geisha. The sets were great. The costumes were cool too but I do wish there was a little more emphasis on the kimonos. I was looking forward to seeing the amazingly detailed kimonos described in the novel. And the ones that are shown aren't onscreen very long. There was a part of me that wished the actors were allowed to speak in Japanese or Cantonese. The English was good but there were times when the lines were slurred so the illusion was broken a couple of times but being that some of the actors had like weeks of classes it was pretty impressive (and probably quicker to learn than Japanese). ""A"" for effort. The music was typical Asian flavored fare you'd find in ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Flying Daggers"": big drums, violin solos, various wind instruments, that sort of thing. Since I love that kind of music I felt right at home. The sets were gorgeous. The town where the geishas live where taken right from the novel. Fabulous!As for the ""chinese portraying japanese"" issue: culturally there was probably an offense committed. It probably is like seeing a white person in blackface. However, in this case I believe that the director chose the best people to portray these roles. People play roles that are different from their race and gender all the time and this is no exception. And I think the actors portrayed these roles with great respect to the Japanese culture. I didn't sense any stereotypes or parody from the performances. I didn't see Chinese or Japanese or Malaysian or whatever...I just saw characters going through life experiences.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Memoirs"" and I will be purchasing the DVD as soon as it comes out. Though the film is well done I do recommend reading the original novel to get the other part of the story the film didn't have time to tell which was the inside world of the geisha. How do they put those complicated kimonos on? What is that shape on the back of their necks about? The book covers these details so to get the full picture read the novel.

I was extremely pleased and elated to see such a beautiful film which was so true to the book.  One thing is for sure, the film is gorgeous. There are scenes where the colour seems to bleed off the screen, and some just look like portraits.The story follows one particular Japanese peasant girl whose father sends her and her sister to a famous geisha house. Her less attractive sister is sent away to a house of prostitution, and Chiyo is given domestic tasks until the time when she can be trained to be a geisha....Naturally, the main appeal of the film is the glimpse into the true nature of the geisha. How a geisha becomes a pinnacle of elegance and class, a master of entertainment and a royal agent of many gentle graces, how she sells her skills and not her body, how she can be the keeper of traditional arts, and how she can stop a man in his tracks with only one look.Zhang has ""the sea in her eyes."" She is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the tender mood of every man, the quality of being graceful, the gentlemen's companion enclosed by an ever-changing Japan towards the start of World War II. The apprentice courtesan stretches the limits of realism for her lifelong devotion to a mysterious wealthy benefactor whose kindness to Sayuri as a child left a lasting impression. Sayuri preferred not to insist on her affection, even when time and circumstance conspire to take her away from the man she loves for years at a time, and was subjected to dramatic situations by the rivalry between the opposing Geisha houses.Certainly if you want to see a beautiful, thoughtful, emotional film centred around a little-understood but fascinating aspect of Japanese culture, see this as soon as possible.",4,Breathtaking,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1818,"['negative', 'reviews', 'mind', 'began', 'watching', 'film', 'braced', 'worst', 'was', 'extremely', 'pleased', 'elated', 'see', 'such', 'beautiful', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'true', 'book', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'colour', 'bleed', 'off', 'screen', 'just', 'look', 'portraits.The', 'story', 'one', 'particular', 'Japanese', 'peasant', 'girl', 'father', 'sister', 'famous', 'geisha', 'house', 'less', 'attractive', 'sister', 'sent', 'away', 'house', 'prostitution', 'Chiyo', 'given', 'domestic', 'tasks', 'time', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'trained', 'be', 'geisha', '.Naturally', 'main', 'appeal', 'film', 'glimpse', 'true', 'nature', 'geisha', 'How', 'geisha', 'pinnacle', 'elegance', 'class', 'master', 'entertainment', 'royal', 'agent', 'many', 'gentle', 'graces', 'how', 'skills', 'not', 'body', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'keeper', 'traditional', 'arts', 'how', 'can', 'stop', 'man', 'tracks', 'only', 'one', 'look.Zhang', 'sea', 'eyes', 'fascinating', 'lovely', 'heroine', 'tender', 'mood', 'man', 'quality', 'being', 'graceful', 'gentlemen', 'companion', 'enclosed', 'ever-changing', 'Japan', 'start', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'apprentice', 'courtesan', 'limits', 'realism', 'lifelong', 'devotion', 'mysterious', 'wealthy', 'benefactor', 'kindness', 'Sayuri', 'child', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'Sayuri', 'preferred', 'not', 'insist', 'affection', 'even', 'when', 'time', 'circumstance', 'conspire', 'take', 'away', 'man', 'years', 'time', 'was', 'subjected', 'dramatic', 'situations', 'rivalry', 'opposing', 'Geisha', 'houses.Certainly', 'want', 'see', 'beautiful', 'thoughtful', 'emotional', 'film', 'centred', 'little-understood', 'fascinating', 'aspect', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'see', 'as', 'soon', 'possible']",N/A

As an author, and as a writer, I must disagree.  I don't want to insult anyone but there was so much more in this movie.  The history and culture presented in this film is a sneak preview of what must have been a very compelling novel, which I will order from Amazon, now that I have seen the movie.If you want to know whether to read it or buy the DVD, my four stars apply to the movie.  This movie won the Oscar for cinematography, among other things and the panoramic views of the scenery in Japan is fully realized on the widescreen.  So, if you don't have a widescreen TV folks, please don't settle for anything but a full screen version. You will get cheated if you try a widescreen version on a regular TV.  This movie is very, very visual.  I watched it repeatedly just for the beauty of it.Now as for the plot, I will let the review of others guide you.  The same reviewer who I have complained stereo typed the story truly did give a good report for this movie.  He did not give a synopsis and I feel like others have submitted a worthwhile syopsis, so I won't go there.This romantic drama tells the story of what could have happened to any Japanese girl living before the American assimilation of the Japanese culture into the western world.  The history is accurate and exotic in its content.I'm a nitpicker.  I find errors in everything except my own work. (This is due to the fact that I can't stand to read my own work and do not have the expertise of an editor) However, I can warn you that there are several places that needed clarification to keep the viewers from getting confused about the customs of the geisha.  Some loose ends were spotted here and there.  I hope to find those answers in the book.  I won't point them out because if no one else notices it they will enjoy the movie much better, but for nitpickers like me...be forewarned!  If the loose ends had been edited properly, the movie would have won more academy awards and I would have given it five stars.This movie is impressive and worth watching.

Ah well, times change.  I still haven't read the book, although perhaps now I will. Because I was taken by the intensity, the mystery, and clearly by the beauty of this film.Yes, beauty. Beautiful women, beautiful costumes, beautiful dances, gardens full of cherry blossoms, the elegant life of traditional Japan. Of course, underneath, it's not so great. First, two young girls are sold by their parents: the youngest is about nine, the oldest perhaps 11 or 12. The youngest, exquisitely beautiful even at that age, is kept by the mama of the geisha house, but she doesn't want the older girl, who is not as pretty. It turns out later she was sold to a ""house of pleasure.""I'm sorry I never did get their names. But our future geisha is first a servant, and then is sent to school to learn to be a geisha. She is taught all the subtleties of her position, such as how to reward the gentleman with a brief show of her wrist as she pours his tea. She learns music, dancing, singing, the art of conversation, the most elegant way to walk, sit, stand, move, all about her makeup and wardrobe, and on and on.She also learns about rivalry among the geishas, including in this specific case, who the owner of the geisha house will name as her heir when she is ready to retire. Each apprentice has a ""big sister"" who guides her in learning to be a real geisha, including how to stop a man in his tracks with just one glance.She also learns that her virginity will be ever so delicately sold to the highest bidder from among those to whom she offers a token that he is welcome to bid. She will also need a ""sponsor,"" basically a sugar daddy, who will make her his mistress and buy her lavish gifts.They are constantly told they are not whores, but that does not mean they are not for sale. They're just not for rent.It's a confusing story for an American woman, but a charming one in many respects.

I'd like to add that John Williams (the GREAT John Williams) was nominated for Best Music, but did not win. I must admit that I watched this movie by chance, since I heard several bad reviews about it, but I liked the movie and I will say why. I liked the movie because it is beautiful (costumes, landscapes, acting, story...). Second, because I learned something about what a Geisha is (and is NOT). Third, because I found the story to be so moving and powerful, from the very beginning where the two sisters are brutally pulled apart from their family, to the very end, when the true love of the Geisha unveils.This movie put me also in the spot of having to create an opinion on tradition. Specially at the beginning, it is easy to ""hate"" those traditions that are hardly understandable. But as the movie moves on, it is easier to understand why, since we are given information about what a Geisha is.The only thing I did not like about the movie is that chracters speak in English, and it was kind of hard for me to ""buy it"". I'd liked the movie to be shot in Japanese, with English subtitles instead. I have not read the book, so I can't compare the book to the movie (I heard a lot about the book being better than the movie, but that happens most of the times, and I'm not surprised, even though I have to say that a book is a book, and a movie a movie).Overall, I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is a touching love story with a lot of beauty in there.

168994,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,1404983082,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 7]","Sometimes films are excellent. Sometimes they exceed our expectations. And sometimes - just sometimes - they transcend all of that and turn into something more; they become a work of art.Such is the case with MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA directed by Rob Marshall (CHICAGO, 2002). Based on Arthur Golden's best-selling novel of the same name, this movie goes beyond cinema and transports you to another time and country.The film begins on the shores of pre-WWII Japan in a tiny fishing village where a mother lay dying. Two daughters peer between wood slats at their father as he speaks to an ominous looking man in a nice suit. Chiyo (an amazing Suzuka Ohgo) and her older sister are soon ripped away from their family and forced into a world of servitude. Chiyo's older sister is lost to houses of ill-repute, while Chiyo is pulled into a strange yet beautiful home run by a demanding ""mother"" and ""auntie."" Chiyo has entered the realm of the Geisha.Being a pretty young girl with blue eyes, Chiyo is selected to go to Geisha school. But bad blood is brewing in Chiyo's new home. A beautiful Geisha already lives there and quickly becomes jealous of Chiyo. Terrible threats and beatings ensue, and one lonely day, while Chiyo is on a bridge overlooking a river, a handsome man approaches (Ken Watanabe, THE LAST SAMURAI) with kind words and gives her some sweet ice. They chat and Chiyo is immediately enamored with him. She now has a goal. She will become the best Geisha ever so that they might meet again.As Chiyo grows and becomes more and more beautiful and wanted, the house she lives in is ready to ignite. Now fully Geisha and fully grown (Ziyi Zhang, RUSH HOUR 2), she is bribed away from Mama-san and moves in with Mameha (Michelle Yoeh, THE TOUCH) who teaches her the true nature of Geisha.World War II, other men, jealous Geisha, and years of isolation block Chiyo's plans to meet up with her first love. But through perseverance, prayer, and trust, Chiyo's wishes cannot be denied.______________________________________________________________________________This film is, as stated earlier, a piece of art. Every frame, every image, is carefully crafted, taking into consideration light, color, imagery, facial features, the times, and a multitude of other items I can't even begin to explain nor understand.The initial dark lighting of the film was an excellent way to start, giving us a feel for those sullen times, and also letting us know that this part of the narrators memory was fuzzy and long ago. But as the film progresses, we see brighter colors and light. By the time the film wraps up, the colors are so wondrous you feel like you could eat the screen or, at the very least, reach out and pluck this flower or that.There's been a lot of commentary about the use of Chinese actors and actresses in prime roles rather than Japanese. This is undeniably so. But it didn't detract from my enjoyment of it (have we become so self-righteous that we can't have other races playing in such roles? Does anyone remember Marlon Brando in TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON?)Could the production crew have tried harder to put a Japanese native in one of those positions? Probably. But this film is so sumptuous, I didn't even notice the differences (no disrespect meant to anyone Japanese.)",5,WOW! I mean ...WOW!

Although I appreciate the concerns of people who dislike the inauthentic aspects of the film (non-Japanese actors, costumes from multiple time periods), I also appreciate that it can be really tough to get an ""art film"" financed and produced. I assume every compromise had a reason, and the end result still is that this film is beautifully done. Like many Westerners, I am not good at detecting whether a person is of this or that Asian heritage, but this is not very important when it comes to enjoying the story.  What matters most are the plot and the emotions of the characters. I found fascinating this intimate epic about a poor girl raised to be a geisha and learning how to reach the top of her profession. For me, watching the DVD at home without feeling rushed or tired, the pace was perfect. The novel is wonderful and so is the movie. Yes, the novel may be better (often the case when books are translated into film) simply because a book takes more time to complete, has more interior dialog, and draws you deeper into the characters. The actors here all are excellent, conveying the characters much as envisioned when I read the book. I do agree with James Gebhardt ""Film Addict"" that it might have been good to use an Asian director. There certainly are many great ones. But if the Chinese director Ang Lee can make ""Brokeback Mountain"" without criticism for being of a different race than his cast -- why can't an American make a Japanese film?

Chiyo is friends with Pumpkin, a young girl who's going to succeed Hatsumomo has the next okiya's geisha with Chiyo still kept a servant girl.Fate steps in when Mameha, an accomplished geisha comes in the picture and decides to train her as a geisha. Renamed Sayuri, she becomes a celebrated geisha with quite a few men after her, including Nobu, a geisha despising businessman; his partner the Chairman; and the Baron, who is a bit too in love with pretty young girls if you catch my drift.I will admit: this is an admittedly gorgeous film. A scene directly at the end I was just like ""holy **** that's nice"" and there's plenty of other scenes as well. Although there's some shots I wish were in Sayuri's dance from the trailer but that's alright. There's plenty of other beautiful scenes in the film and the costumes definately deserved its win. It's funny that King Kong won many of the technical awards(some of which were undeserved) while Geisha got all the aesthetic technical awards, which to me were deserved.Here's where it gets nasty to me. The film jumped over many things in the book, which you will always most likely see. But here the scenes seem kind of scatterbrained, as if they just jump from one minute to the next without any kind of flow to them. Chiyo spent quite a bit of time at home before she was sold to the okiya, she actually met Tanaka and spoke with him several times. Here, her and Satsu are out of the house literally within 2 minutes of the film's opening.The whole controversy over the casting I didn't even notice to be honest. Yes there's some chinese actors playing japanese characters in a story set in Japan but in watching the film it didn't even occur to me ""oh yeah, they're chinese!"". If anything it's weird seeing a character say something in japanese then everything else is English. Not to mention only a couple of actors sound convicing delivering English, others are very halted(""you.are.to become.geisha!"").If you're a fan of the book, check it out. If you're not and just interesting in japanese culture check it out.

169009,AKHJVOYEX6QME,1404983082,"Colleen McMahon ""&#34;Omnivorous Reader&#34;""","[6, 8]","Having read the reviews of Memoirs of a Geisha, I knew that many thought it to be a beautiful bore, acted as well as possible but with a lot of the life sucked out of it, maybe mediocre direction, etc.However, having just finished listening to the audiobook and loved it, I was desperate to SEE what I had been imagining.  It could be boring as long as it was beautiful, as long as I could see the settings, the geisha training, the makeup, the beautiful kimono, the streets of the geisha district, the performances of dance and shamisen, the way that geisha interact with clients and so on.  And there were several great scenes in the book that I so wanted to see acted out because they were so cinematic in the telling--especially the scheming of Hatsumomo against Chiyo/Sayuri as she tries to thwart the rise of the younger geisha.The movie has to condense a quite long and nuanced book, and choices had to be made of what to include and what to leave out.  I agreed with some, such as the condensation of nearly 50 pages of Chiyo's life before she was sold into geishadom into the first 5 minutes of the movie, and the drawn out denouement in the postwar period with Sayuri and her scarred admirer Nobu circling each other, with Sayuri trying to avoid or come to accept her seemingly inevitable role as Nobu's mistress.However, certain of the choices in adaptation rob the movie of some of the emotional depth of the book.  I think the biggest loss was the tension of the relationship between Sayuri and Nobu, who is head of a wealthy corporation and friend to the man Sayuri has secretly loved for years, the Chairman.  Nobu is a gruff man who often lashes out at those around him.  In the book Sayuri gradually comes to see past both his manners and his somewhat gruesome appearance to care deeply for the man as a friend, but she fears to have him as her danna (sponsor) because it would mean the end of any ambition to ever be with the Chairman.  It's important to the character of Sayuri that she no longer sees his scars (and in the book, missing arm) and cares for the man; this is not seen in the movie and it's easy to get the impression that her rejection of Nobu is based on his appearance.Many have complained of both the book and the movie that the relationship between Sayuri and the Chairman is unbelievable and maybe a little icky, since she is a child when she first meets him and carries a torch for him for many years before they are able to connect in any way, and he is many years older than her.  It's hard to see that what she feels for him is actual love of any kind.  But I think this is something that the movie does better than the book.  In the book the Chairman remains a faceless enigma throughout, but Ken Watanabe does a wonderful job in a smallish role of humanizing him and implying a mutual attraction that both must suppress due to position and loyalties.  It makes the ultimate conclusion to their story much more satisfying than the book.On the whole, I don't think it was a totally successful movie, but was as successful an adaptation as possible of a book that had to be incredibly difficult to turn into a film.  The acting in all the major roles was quite good and all three of the main female actors were believable as geisha.  I expected certain things to be subtracted and changed in the interests of expediency and they were, but there were a few additions that actually added something to the book, and it was indeed beautiful to look at and very exciting to see depictions of a story that had been so vivid in my head.But I would still recommend reading the book before or in addition to the movie!",4,As good as I expected,1136678400,"01 8, 2006",2006,3651,"['Having', 'read', 'reviews', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'knew', 'many', 'thought', 'be', 'beautiful', 'bore', 'acted', 'as', 'well', 'possible', 'lot', 'life', 'sucked', 'maybe', 'mediocre', 'direction', 'etc.However', 'having', 'just', 'finished', 'listening', 'audiobook', 'loved', 'was', 'desperate', 'SEE', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'imagining', 'could', 'be', 'boring', 'as', 'long', 'was', 'beautiful', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'see', 'settings', 'geisha', 'training', 'makeup', 'beautiful', 'kimono', 'streets', 'geisha', 'district', 'performances', 'dance', 'shamisen', 'way', 'interact', 'clients', 'so', 'were', 'several', 'great', 'scenes', 'book', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'acted', 'out', 'were', 'so', 'cinematic', 'telling', 'especially', 'scheming', 'Hatsumomo', 'Chiyo/Sayuri', 'thwart', 'rise', 'younger', 'geisha.The', 'movie', 'condense', 'quite', 'long', 'nuanced', 'book', 'choices', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'what', 'include', 'what', 'leave', 'out', 'agreed', 'such', 'condensation', 'nearly', '50', 'pages', 'Chiyo', 'life', 'was', 'sold', 'geishadom', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'movie', 'drawn', 'out', 'denouement', 'postwar', 'period', 'Sayuri', 'scarred', 'admirer', 'Nobu', 'circling', 'other', 'Sayuri', 'trying', 'avoid', 'come', 'accept', 'seemingly', 'inevitable', 'role', 'Nobu', 'mistress.However', 'certain', 'choices', 'adaptation', 'rob', 'movie', 'emotional', 'depth', 'book', 'think', 'biggest', 'loss', 'was', 'tension', 'relationship', 'Sayuri', 'Nobu', 'who', 'head', 'wealthy', 'corporation', 'friend', 'man', 'Sayuri', 'secretly', 'loved', 'years', 'Chairman', 'Nobu', 'gruff', 'man', 'who', 'often', 'out', 'book', 'Sayuri', 'gradually', 'see', 'past', 'manners', 'somewhat', 'gruesome', 'appearance', 'care', 'deeply', 'man', 'friend', 'have', 'danna', 'sponsor', 'would', 'mean', 'end', 'ambition', 'ever', 'be', 'Chairman', 'important', 'character', 'Sayuri', 'no', 'longer', 'scars', 'book', 'missing', 'arm', 'man', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'easy', 'get', 'impression', 'rejection', 'Nobu', 'based', 'appearance.Many', 'have', 'complained', 'book', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Sayuri', 'Chairman', 'unbelievable', 'maybe', 'little', 'icky', 'child', 'when', 'first', 'torch', 'many', 'years', 'are', 'able', 'connect', 'way', 'many', 'years', 'older', 'hard', 'see', 'what', 'actual', 'love', 'kind', 'think', 'something', 'movie', 'better', 'book', 'book', 'Chairman', 'faceless', 'enigma', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'wonderful', 'job', 'smallish', 'role', 'humanizing', 'implying', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'must', 'suppress', 'due', 'position', 'loyalties', 'ultimate', 'conclusion', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'book.On', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'totally', 'successful', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'successful', 'adaptation', 'possible', 'book', 'had', 'be', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'turn', 'film', 'acting', 'major', 'roles', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'three', 'main', 'female', 'actors', 'were', 'believable', 'geisha', 'expected', 'certain', 'things', 'be', 'subtracted', 'changed', 'interests', 'expediency', 'were', 'were', 'few', 'additions', 'actually', 'added', 'something', 'book', 'was', 'indeed', 'beautiful', 'look', 'very', 'exciting', 'see', 'depictions', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'vivid', 'head.But', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'addition', 'movie']",N/A

It is hard to explain what went wrong with Geisha, a story that promised to be one of the most fascinating tales of women's plight in the Pacific Hemisphere.  From the beginning where our protagonist is sold by her father to the end where she is adapting to life in post war Japan, this tale has it all: drama, tragedy, love, violence, loyalty, etc.  All of the elements are here for an inspired movie.  It just all seems to have gotten lost in the execution.  There is way too much attention to scenery and too little to the story.  In screen time, it takes longer for the Geisha to get dressed than for World War II to start and finish.  No matter how dramatic the moment may become, it is deadened by the most laid back musical score.  To make matters worse, the two leading actresses were the same two leading ladies from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  A number of scenes in Geisha are reminiscent of scenes from Crouching Tiger, even though the stories are entirely unrelated.  In all cases, all comparisons between the two movies are unfavorable.

I thought the air of this film, the grace of the charactors and the scenery, the sincerity of the dialog and the passion behind the eyes of everyone involved in the project screamed to be heard.  I'm ot going to even attempt to spell out the names of the charactors in the film, but I will tell you that both Ziyi and Gong are amazing, especially Gong who I feel deserves an Oscar nod for her portrayal of the jealous rival geisha.  The film follows the life of a young girl (Ziyi) sold to the geisha house by her ailing parents.  It shows her struggle to live in a world she's never known and how she reaches her goal to get closer to the man whom she loves played by Last Samuri star Ken Watanabi (hysi)...I wish that Ken would have had more screen time for he is a very talented actor.  This is a beautiful film directed wonderfully by Rob Marshall (Chicago) and it has the glitter and glam of his previous film, but it's much more personal than Chicago.  Geisha leaves you feeling fulfilled because you watched a film that mattered, a film that had a purpose, unlike Chicago, while being a great film didn't leave you feeling anything of importace because it didn't really matter.  This young orphans life mattered, the reason being that she rose above all she had working against her and became something admired and wanted by all.  She became someone respected...the greatest living geisha.  I loved this film and would recomend it to anyone who loves movies with heart.

169016,A2P49WD75WHAG5,1404983082,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[5, 6]","The release of the movie adaptation of Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha was much anticipated given its success on the bestselling list.  I myself managed to read the book partway before seeing the movie.  Two sisters, Chiyo and Satsu, are seized from their fishing village home sitting atop a cliff on a rainy night, frightened, cold, confused, as to why they are being taken away.  Once in Kyoto, the siblings are separated.  The younger, Chiyo, is sent to an okiya (a registered house for geishas live) to become a maid while a different fate awaits her sister.  So begins the trials for eight-year old Chiyo, who experiences firsthand the struggles of a woman to survive in the harsh early Showa period, pre- and post-war.The okiya is run by Ms. Nitta, aka Mother, a strict, no-nonsense woman who's so intent on the business, she must've been born with an abacus instead of a pacifier.  There's the slightly kinder Auntie, the other maid Pumpkin, and then there's Hatsumomo.  This last is a geisha.  Geisha means artist, and they are educated in the fine arts of entertaining, such as dancing, playing the shamisen (a three-stringed lute).  She's beautiful but with a venomous personality, and sees Chiyo as lower than trash.  She even has a male lover (forbidden under the geisha code), but Hatsumomo brings in the bulk of the okiya's revenue, her position is secure.  She makes Chiyo's life hell and even makes her damage the kimono of Mameha, a rival geisha.""None of us finds much kindness in this world like we should,"" says the Chairman, a handsome man in a business suit to a depressed Chiyo.  He buys her some kakigouri (shaved ice with syrup) and cheers her up.  Perhaps not much kindness, but a change in fortune takes place when the older but more elegant Mameha takes Chiyo under her wing to become a geisha.  As a novice, Chiyo becomes Mameha's apprentice, and gets her geisha name Sayuri.  However, Mameha is also interested in causing Hatsumomo's downfall.  Hatsumomo in turn takes the timid Pumpkin as her own apprentice.It turns out that Mameha knows the Chairman, and also his no-nonsense partner Nobu-san, a veteran with a scarred face who cares nothing for geishas, but more on business and sumo.  Sayuri wins him over, though he hides it with his gruffness.  Mameha also introduces Sayuri to others who have influence and will thus help her gain status.  Yet Sayuri nurses loving feelings for the Chairman, while Mameha steers her towards Nobu to become his mistress and he her danna (patron).Geishas are also trained in verbal sophistication, which Sayuri does when she tells Nobu-san that she wants to know the dances of sumo and business.  She also tells a medical doctor who was tricked into believing Hatsumomo's lies about her, ""Take your own advice.  Get a second opinion."" And as for dances, Sayuri's dance with lights and indoor snow is simply marvelous to behold.As usual, there are some deviations and omissions from the book.  General Tottori, who in the book is Sayuri's danna, has been totally excised, as has the Minister, so Sayuri's act of betrayal towards the end of the book is committed with an American general, which galls me.  And the novel didn't focus too much on the postwar period as does this movie.  The various kimonos worn and the suffering the geishas have to go through come out in the movie, such as the special pillows they sleep on so as not to ruin their hairdo, and training to wear okobo (basically platform sandals, proving that high shoes didn't originate in the disco era).  And the sets that make up 1930's Kyoto are superior, sending the viewer into a bygone era.Finally, the decision to cast Chinese as opposed to Japanese actresses in the leads initially got my hackles up, but I was so entranced after seeing Zhang Ziyi (Sayuri), Michelle Yeoh (Mameha), and Gong Li (Hatsumomo), I let it slide.  And this comes from a half-Japanese like myself, so bear that in mind.  However, Suzuka Ohgo as the young Chiyo adds sparkle to the film, as does Koji Yakusho as Nobu-san.

169017,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1404983082,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 7]","With so many filmmakers producing films these days, it's a rare joy to sit and watch a work of actual cinematic artistry.  Memoir of a Geisha is a beautiful film in almost every way - the vibrant cinematography, the music (featuring a score by John Williams and solos by both Itzhak Perlman and Yo-Yo Ma), and of course the mysterious Geisha at the heart of this story.  One can easily understand why many, especially the Japanese, were less than thrilled by the casting of Chinese actresses in the film's prominent roles (especially since the Chinese and Japanese were at war during the era in which this story takes place), but I don't think anyone can complain about the women's performances.  Gong Li portrays the vindictive Hatsumomo to a tee, even revealing the vulnerability that helped make her the wicked woman she was.  Michelle Yeoh brings grace and beauty to the part of Mameha, the woman who made it possible for the main character to escape a life of virtual slavery and become the Geisha she longed to be.  For me, though, it's really all about Ziyi Zhang, a young actress whose beauty and talent have never failed to mesmerize me.  She was absolutely enchanting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and House of the Flying Daggers, and this film allowed me to see her in a completely dramatic light.  I must also add that Zhang had some pretty big shoes to fill, as Suzuka Ohgo was absolutely fabulous as Chiyo, the girl who would grow up to be one of the most celebrated Geishas in the land.I think most Westerners tend to associate Geisha with prostitutes, owing mainly to the reality of Japanese girls calling themselves Geisha as they sold themselves to American soldiers after the war.  The whole concept of Geisha is quite foreign to most of us in the West - Memoirs of a Geisha reveals a small part of that exotic world to us, but I would be the first to admit I still know next to nothing about the Geisha lifestyle.  As this film makes clear, though, they were not prostitutes at all - the Geisha were and are entertainers skilled in such things as singing and dancing.  Their art was their life, as they were not permitted to truly live their own lives - they could not even consider love or marriage and remain a Geisha, leaving many of them to lead secret lives of unhappiness beneath the gaiety that was their trademark.The film follows the life of Sakamoto Chiyo from childhood through World War II and beyond.  Even as her mother lay dying, she and her sister were sold, Chiyo going to a Geisha house and her sister to a brothel.  Robbed of family and friends, Chiyo was soon stripped of her dignity as well, as the jealous machinations of Hatsumomo (Gong Li) lead to her becoming little more than a slave for the Geisha house.  In the midst of her misery, she meets a most kind man on the streets, a man known as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), and commits herself to somehow becoming a Geisha and meeting the Chairman again.  This love she feels for the only person to show her any real kindness only grows over time.  Fate finally smiles upon her when Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), a famous Geisha from a rival house, takes her under her wing as part of an elaborate plan to deny Hatsumomo the power and influence she yearns for.  Not only does Mamaha transform Chiyo almost overnight, she grooms her into the most famous Geisha in that part of Japan.  Even with her Geisha dream fulfilled, however, Chiyo - now known as Sayuri - does not know happiness.  While she has found a place near the Chairman, she is compelled to give most of her attention to his friend Nobu, and her only real friend is now lost to her.  Then comes the Japanese defeat at the hands of the Americans, seemingly ending Sayuri's Geisha days forever.  Fate eventually grants her one more chance: to don the kimono and to win the love traditionally denied the Geisha.I think Memoirs of a Geisha is an exquisite film immersed in all forms of beauty.  This is, when all is said and done, a love story that etches itself permanently into your memory.  Admittedly, my fondness and admiration for Ziyi Zhang probably made the story more appealing that it would have been otherwise, but Zhang is such an expressive and talented actress, how can you not immerse yourself in the suffering she endures?  All of the inner tumult that lies underneath the makeup and fancy clothes is most tellingly revealed in the dance she performs as part of what could be called her debut.  Her graceful movements soon give way to a wild yet artful desperation that I can hardly describe.  It is the creepiest (and most fascinating) dance I have ever seen - and it's only one of many gorgeous scenes in this exotic, undeniably poignant human drama.",5,"A gorgeous, moving, must-see film",1150588800,"06 18, 2006",2006,4718,"['so', 'many', 'filmmakers', 'producing', 'films', 'days', 'rare', 'joy', 'sit', 'watch', 'work', 'actual', 'cinematic', 'artistry', 'Memoir', 'Geisha', 'beautiful', 'film', 'almost', 'way', 'vibrant', 'cinematography', 'music', 'featuring', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'solos', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'course', 'mysterious', 'Geisha', 'heart', 'story', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'understand', 'why', 'many', 'especially', 'Japanese', 'were', 'less', 'thrilled', 'casting', 'Chinese', 'actresses', 'film', 'prominent', 'roles', 'especially', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'were', 'war', 'era', 'story', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'can', 'complain', 'women', 'performances', 'Gong', 'Li', 'vindictive', 'Hatsumomo', 'tee', 'even', 'revealing', 'vulnerability', 'helped', 'make', 'wicked', 'woman', 'was', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'grace', 'beauty', 'part', 'Mameha', 'woman', 'who', 'made', 'possible', 'main', 'character', 'escape', 'life', 'virtual', 'slavery', 'become', 'Geisha', 'longed', 'be', 'though', 'really', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'young', 'actress', 'beauty', 'talent', 'have', 'never', 'failed', 'mesmerize', 'was', 'absolutely', 'enchanting', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'film', 'allowed', 'see', 'completely', 'dramatic', 'light', 'must', 'also', 'add', 'Zhang', 'had', 'pretty', 'big', 'shoes', 'fill', 'Suzuka', 'Ohgo', 'was', 'absolutely', 'fabulous', 'Chiyo', 'girl', 'who', 'would', 'grow', 'up', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'celebrated', 'Geishas', 'land.I', 'think', 'most', 'Westerners', 'tend', 'associate', 'Geisha', 'prostitutes', 'owing', 'mainly', 'reality', 'Japanese', 'girls', 'calling', 'Geisha', 'sold', 'American', 'soldiers', 'war', 'whole', 'concept', 'Geisha', 'quite', 'foreign', 'most', 'West', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'small', 'part', 'exotic', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'still', 'know', 'next', 'nothing', 'Geisha', 'lifestyle', 'film', 'clear', 'though', 'were', 'not', 'prostitutes', 'Geisha', 'were', 'are', 'entertainers', 'skilled', 'such', 'things', 'singing', 'dancing', 'art', 'was', 'life', 'were', 'not', 'permitted', 'truly', 'live', 'own', 'lives', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'consider', 'love', 'marriage', 'remain', 'Geisha', 'leaving', 'many', 'lead', 'secret', 'lives', 'unhappiness', 'gaiety', 'was', 'trademark.The', 'film', 'life', 'Sakamoto', 'Chiyo', 'childhood', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Even', 'mother', 'lay', 'dying', 'sister', 'were', 'sold', 'Chiyo', 'going', 'Geisha', 'house', 'sister', 'brothel', 'Robbed', 'family', 'friends', 'Chiyo', 'was', 'soon', 'stripped', 'dignity', 'as', 'well', 'jealous', 'machinations', 'Hatsumomo', 'Gong', 'Li', 'lead', 'becoming', 'little', 'more', 'slave', 'Geisha', 'house', 'midst', 'misery', 'most', 'kind', 'man', 'streets', 'man', 'known', 'Chairman', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'somehow', 'becoming', 'Geisha', 'meeting', 'Chairman', 'again', 'love', 'only', 'person', 'show', 'real', 'kindness', 'only', 'time', 'Fate', 'finally', 'when', 'Mameha', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'famous', 'Geisha', 'rival', 'house', 'wing', 'part', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'deny', 'Hatsumomo', 'power', 'influence', 'Not', 'only', 'Mamaha', 'transform', 'Chiyo', 'almost', 'overnight', 'grooms', 'most', 'famous', 'Geisha', 'part', 'Japan', 'Even', 'Geisha', 'dream', 'fulfilled', 'however', 'Chiyo', 'now', 'known', 'Sayuri', 'not', 'know', 'happiness', 'found', 'place', 'Chairman', 'compelled', 'give', 'most', 'attention', 'friend', 'Nobu', 'only', 'real', 'friend', 'now', 'lost', 'Then', 'Japanese', 'defeat', 'hands', 'Americans', 'seemingly', 'ending', 'Sayuri', 'Geisha', 'days', 'forever', 'Fate', 'eventually', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'don', 'kimono', 'win', 'love', 'traditionally', 'denied', 'Geisha.I', 'think', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'exquisite', 'film', 'immersed', 'forms', 'beauty', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'love', 'story', 'permanently', 'memory', 'Admittedly', 'fondness', 'admiration', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'probably', 'made', 'story', 'more', 'appealing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'otherwise', 'Zhang', 'such', 'expressive', 'talented', 'actress', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'immerse', 'suffering', 'inner', 'tumult', 'makeup', 'fancy', 'clothes', 'most', 'tellingly', 'revealed', 'dance', 'part', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'debut', 'graceful', 'movements', 'soon', 'give', 'way', 'wild', 'yet', 'artful', 'desperation', 'can', 'hardly', 'describe', 'creepiest', 'most', 'fascinating', 'dance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'only', 'one', 'many', 'gorgeous', 'scenes', 'exotic', 'undeniably', 'poignant', 'human', 'drama']",N/A

A fascinating film could no doubt be made about the world of geishas and what their lives were like, but this is not it.  This is a visually sumptuous film that completely buys into the supposed romaticism of female subjugation.  Instead of a psychologically or sociologically astute film, we get a melodramatic cat fight as the geishas battle over reputation, clients, and money.The film has other problems as well.  While the cast was uniformly excellent, it was distracting that everyone had a different accent.  Gong Li, an actress whose work I admire greatly, was particularly difficult to understand.  The soundtrack, with its keening strings, often sounded more Chinese than Japanese.  Little effort seems to have been made toward authenticity.  At Sayuri's debut performance before an audience of the rich and powerful, she gyrates wildly in a fashion that is no doubt meant to portray great passion, causing spectators to swoon with admiration.

I will give you that.However, it is certainly a different take on the typical rags to riches story. It starts with a fisherman's daughter named Chiyo (misspelling?) who lived in a small village being sold into slavery because, apparently, her family could no longer afford to feed her and her sister. She was beautiful enough to be purchased by a Geisha House, but her sister was not, and was instead sold to a brothel. Thus begins the struggle of the two girls to escape to a better life.Little Chiyo is immediately seen as a threat to the leading Geisha of the house named Hatsumomo (I am doing my best with the spellings of the names and such. If you know I am wrong, please tell me the correct spelling and I will change them. Thanks.). Hatsumomo is a brash, arrogant, and cruel person who will stop at nothing to make it to the top. She is determined and smart, but sadly enough does not use those qualities in a good way at all.To make a long review short, Chiyo's family is taken from her, either by death or banishment and she is left alone in the world to serve off her debt to the Okia. While she is a servant, she meets a man on a bridge and falls in love with him (as much as a 12 year old can be in love), and vows to become a Geisha to be a part of his world and win his affections.Well, I will not give away the whole movie through a simple review, so you will have to watch it to find out the rest. I consider this to be one of the best movies recently put out on the shelves, so it is certainly worth buying. The acting is good, the music is lovely, the plot is followable and intriguing.However, if you are not interested in other cultures, you may not enjoy this movie, because it does certainly put an emphasis on the culture of the time and place where she lives.",5,Beautifully Inovative.,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,1875,"['Alright', 'will', 'agree', ""n't"", 'really', 'original', 'really', 'Cinderella-ish', 'movie', 'will', 'give', 'that.However', 'certainly', 'different', 'take', 'typical', 'rags', 'riches', 'story', 'fisherman', 'daughter', 'named', 'Chiyo', 'misspelling', 'who', 'lived', 'small', 'village', 'being', 'sold', 'slavery', 'apparently', 'family', 'could', 'no', 'longer', 'afford', 'feed', 'sister', 'was', 'beautiful', 'enough', 'be', 'purchased', 'Geisha', 'House', 'sister', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'instead', 'sold', 'brothel', 'Thus', 'struggle', 'two', 'girls', 'escape', 'better', 'life.Little', 'Chiyo', 'immediately', 'seen', 'threat', 'leading', 'Geisha', 'house', 'named', 'Hatsumomo', 'am', 'doing', 'best', 'spellings', 'names', 'such', 'know', 'am', 'wrong', 'please', 'tell', 'correct', 'spelling', 'will', 'change', 'Thanks.', 'Hatsumomo', 'brash', 'arrogant', 'cruel', 'person', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'make', 'top', 'determined', 'smart', 'sadly', 'enough', 'not', 'use', 'qualities', 'good', 'way', 'all.To', 'make', 'long', 'review', 'short', 'Chiyo', 'family', 'taken', 'either', 'death', 'banishment', 'left', 'alone', 'world', 'serve', 'off', 'debt', 'Okia', 'servant', 'man', 'bridge', 'love', 'as', 'much', '12', 'year', 'old', 'can', 'be', 'love', 'become', 'Geisha', 'be', 'part', 'world', 'win', 'affections.Well', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'whole', 'movie', 'simple', 'review', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'find', 'out', 'rest', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'recently', 'put', 'out', 'shelves', 'certainly', 'worth', 'buying', 'acting', 'good', 'music', 'lovely', 'plot', 'followable', 'intriguing.However', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'other', 'cultures', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'certainly', 'put', 'emphasis', 'culture', 'time', 'place', 'where']",N/A
169023,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1404983082,Dennis Littrell,"[0, 0]","In Arthur Golden's beautiful novel from which this movie was adapted there is the sense that the geisha exists in a fairytale world removed from harsh reality.  Even though the kimonos have their seamy side that is not for us to see.  The fact that Chiyo was sold into slavery and then charged for room and board and for her education in the pleasing arts, is made clear to the audience, and yet the treatment of the story is very much that of a fairytale.  Chiyo is a Cinderella kind of character, beautiful, graceful, tactful and intelligent, courageous, morally correct and even heroic.This is a good thing and perhaps why the producers worked so hard to get a PG-13 rating.  And maybe it is a good thing that such a movie may be seen by teenaged girls who can afterwards discuss the movie with their mothers.  The geisha as a role model...And then again perhaps I am too harsh.  My problem is that what made the novel so interesting, so much a work of art beyond its commercial success was the fine line that Golden walked between the fairytale and the reality, between the preserving and the selling of Chiyo/Sayuri's virginity, between her rising above the life of a fishmonger's daughter and that of becoming someone who sells herself to the highest bidder.  In the movie this play between the fantasy and the reality is not sufficiently realized.  Certainly director Rob Marshall tried.  But I think the movie falls short of its potential mainly because the contrast was not made sharp enough.  Or perhaps I have become jaded and don't realize that the harsh realities only need to be alluded to.At any rate, the geisha's story (told in the first person by the geisha as an older woman looking back--Shizuko Hoshi does the voice over) is a strange and touching story of love spanning decades and ending in happiness and fulfillment.  But primarily it is a fairy tale, and like all fairy tales there is beneath the surface an underlying current of the dark nature of humanity that can only be glimpsed through the use of symbolism.  Just as the wolf in grandmother's bed represents something more than a wolf, so it is with the men attended by the geisha.  And so it is with her as well.  She projects the image of fairytale beauty and an attentive loveliness, but is in fact a woman of business whose attentions are bought and sold, just as with any commodity.  This is the illusion and the pretense, and the soft, embroidered veil between us and the truth that is paid for.At one point in the film Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) who is mentoring Chiyo tells her that ""we are geishas not courtesans.  We sell our skills not our bodies.""  No doubt this is true to some very real extent.  It is also true that courtesans sell more than their bodies and even common street walkers might be looked upon as workers in a sex industry or even as physical therapists.When I wrote the review for the book some years ago I speculated that this might be made into a epic quality movie, and indeed it was rumored that Steven Spielberg was to direct.  I even thought that in might be made into a Broadway musical or even an opera (and it still might).  Such is the familiar yet universal appear of the central psychology of the story, that of a young and beautiful, but ordinary girl being thrown into an alien culture, where she experiences abuse, jealousy and unrequited love, but manages to triumph over such antagonists.The direction by Rob Marshall, who directed the award-winning musical Chicago (2002), is competent with a nice emphasis on grace and beauty, which is certainly appropriate. Especially excellent was the final scene.  It is touching and Ziyi Zhang plays her part to perfection.  However I didn't like the blue lenses that she had to wear (and I understand she didn't like them either!).  I realize that her eyes were supposed to provoke a sense of a ""water person,"" but I think that could have been achieved without the artificiality of the lenses.  They were particularly grotesque in the final scene with its lengthy close up.Li Gong (or Gong Li--this is the Chinese way in which the last name goes first, or so I am told) was outstanding as always as Hatsumomo, the mean geisha who is jealous of Chiyo; and Suzuka Ohgo who played Chiyo as a little girl was adorable and did an excellent job.  Ken Watanabe as The Chairman captured the sense of a wise and compassionate statesman very well, and Koji Yakusho as Nobu was entirely believable as a man of strength and character.In the final analysis I guess the reason I was not thrilled with the movie is that I thought there was something lost in the adaptation, a subtlety of artistic intent and purpose to show an entire life both before and after World War II, from the time of the Emperor through the hardships that everybody had to endure as the rising sun set.  Perhaps this works better in a 400-page novel than in a 145-minute movie.  On the other hand maybe it is just that I read the book first.  Some people say it is better to read the book first because you are then able to form your own idea of what the characters look like.  Others say it is better to see the movie first because when you read the book the greater depth that is usually there is better appreciated.Anyway, this is an excellent movie although not the masterpiece it might have been.",4,Beautiful but somehow incomplete,1169942400,"01 28, 2007",2007,5325,"['Arthur', 'Golden', 'beautiful', 'novel', 'movie', 'was', 'adapted', 'sense', 'geisha',

169024,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,1404983082,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[0, 1]","As a pastel kaleidoscope of priceless kimono arrangements and ephemeral cherry blossoms, Rob Marshall's screen version of bestselling novel ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" succeeds on every stunningly visual level to recreate the lost world of the pre-WWII geisha, but fails to convey the nuanced range of inner emotions detailed so compellingly and charmingly by author Arthur Golden via the voice of his narrator, Chiyo/Sayuri.In the book, Chiyo reviews her life from the vantage point of a certain age and a posh Park Avenue apartment.  The film details nothing of Chiyo's transition from post war geisha to New York matron; instead Marshall omits this denouement, opting to end his story under the cherry blossoms as the two major characters realize the extent of their connection throughout the years to a crescendo of romantic music and windswept flower petals.Does it work?Not exactly.Although the storyline pretty much from here on in follows the book's plot religiously, the missing dimension of Chiyo's inner thoughts from the novel, so charmingly expressed in similes and metaphors appropriate for a girl from a fishing village training to be a paid entertainer, renders all the pretty sets, costumes and dark-haired beauties ineffective while crafting a pretty movie that bespeaks only half of the book's generated and anticipated pathos.As a dancer, Marshall concentrates on movement as expression rather than the verbalization of our star geisha's actual thoughts.  While the art form of dance certainly plays a part in the life of a geisha, Marshall's focus, while exemplifying the geisha's extensive education, detracts from the overall study of the main character.  The result, despite actress (House of Flying Daggers, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) Ziya Zhang's lovely features and rich talent, smacks of a pretty vacancy where a cinematic sweep of pale blue eyes reflects a wistfulness that is only quasi-conveyed.While the movie itself falls short-not in length by any means----I, a lover of pageantry in general and japanoiserie in particular, found myself at the two hour mark wishing for a swift conclusion---the DVD extras provide a fascinating wealth of featurettte and documentary entertainment that fleshes out the filmmaking process from the adaptation of the novel, to the construction of Kyoto's Gion district on a lot in Southern California.Bottom line?  If you didn't read the book, Chiyo's 145 minute story may titillate you sufficiently to scrub yourself in a hot bath, wrap yourself in at least one delicately patterned silk kimono and practice `less is more' facial expressions in front of the mirror.  However, if you have already luxuriated in Golden's insightful novel, this film version surely will disappoint leaving you wondering why after such a whirlwind of epic events this visual delight is less a Japanese Odyssey and more a soulless soporific that could have been called ""Sleepless in Kyoto"".

However, the onslaught of World War II though alters the Japanese mindset and changes the ways of Geisha culture forever.As of writing this review, Geishas are sadly becoming increasingly rare and are dwindling in numbers especially after the Americanization of Japan after World War II.

The settings are awesome, the music excellent. Zhang Ziyi plays a believeable Geisha, although some viewers have objected she is not Japanese. This seems to me quite a weird objection, since movie making and theatre have always been about actor's performances, and not about their biological origins. If any french character should be played by a French, any Nigerian character played by a Nigerian, would we be able to make films at all?

169030,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,1404983082,Dogville,"[3, 4]","The much-anticipated screen version of Arthur Golden's bestselling book opens with much hype. Casting three of Chinese cinema's darlings, the film looks set to be a runaway success.The film opens with a young Chiyo being sent away to be a geisha. For the next half hour, the girl played by the delightfully wide-eyed 12-year-old Suzuka Ohgo suffers at the hands of big time geisha Hatsumomo played by the lustrous Gong Li. Besides the surreal cinematography, the stars of the film has got to be Suzuka Ohgo and Gong Li. By the time Ohgo's half-hour screentime is up, Gong Li has shown us how she embodies the character of Hatsumomo with aplomb- a woman full of vengeance, contrive and jealousy but with a yearning for love. See her finest at attempting to destroy our poor protaganist.When Zhang Ziyi's Sayuri appears as a grown woman mentored by Michelle Yeoh's Mameha, you can't help but feel that Zhang's thunder has all already been stolen by Gong Li. Zhang can be seen as struggling with her English while trying to portray the vulnerable Sayuri. While language has proven to be a stumbling block, Zhang's acting feels so distant that it leaves an empty feeling and provides no continuation from the warmth that Ohgo brought to the screen as a young Sayuri. It is a clear signal that in her haste to woo Hollywood's audience (including her attempt at anglicizing her name to Ziyi Zhang), she has sacrificed whatever little acting ability that was more evident in Chinese films like 2046. Yeoh's mentor role is played nicely as it is - a steely woman who's determined to help her protege beat arch rival Hatsumomo.In adapting the book for the big screen, screenwriter Robin Swicord has left out parts of the book that provides glimpses into the geisha world. Intricate details of how the kimono is worn and traits of a geisha are missing probably to shorten the already lengthy film.The aim and result is definitely style over substance. If anyone deserves an acting accolade, it should be Gong Li and not the overrated Zhang. Be prepared that Gong Li will miss a nod at the coming Oscars simply because all eyes are on the wrong geisha.

It is a feast for the senses as the visual beauty melds perfectly with magnificent scoring with the collaboration of yo-yo ma and itzhak Perlman under the direction of John Williams . The stunning sets and grandiose Japanese gardens are eye candy as you watch the story unfold. The violin and chello provide a hauntingly magnificent score to this movie that will surely go down in movie history as Rembrandt, van gogh,  Renoir etc. Applied to painting history. When I think of geisha as a movie I see the true form of movies as art. I think Perlman actually has surpassed himself with his performance here. The story unfolds with little chiyo and her sister being sold into slavery by their father. Little chiyo winds up alone in a geisha house to serve the house first as a slave then she is tought the ways of the geisha and becomes the finest geisha in the hannimachi. Intertwined with this is a love affair with the chairman played by Ken watanabe who befriends little chiyo sobbing on a small bridge. Chiyo grows in every way and as a full geisha seeks to reunite with her chairman and is restrained by Japanese custom in her quest. When chiyo becomes a geisha she changes her name to sayuri and has a coming out dance performance that is a stunning visual to see. If you ever wish to see an example of the true state of the art of movies this is the one to see and treasure. The bluray version has many features about the making of the movie that are worthy to watch and I suggest this is preferred to the two disc regular DVD.

169035,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1404983082,Ed Uyeshima,"[4, 5]","Taken on its own terms, this sumptuously appointed 2005 film has an epic sense of melodrama that is quite fulsome and entertaining. The most impressive aspects of Arthur Golden's 1997 source novel, however, are the subtlety of the time-spanning narrative and the meticulous sense of detail and timing around the apprenticeship of a geisha. Director Rob Marshall takes inevitable shortcuts in his film adaptation to accommodate the 144-minute running time, and for me at least, the pacing feels somewhat off with a bit too much time spent on the shadowy, Dickensian childhood scenes and not enough time on the fascinating minutiae of the actual geisha training.Otherwise fairly faithful to the book, the plot follows the life of Chiyo, at first a nine-year old Japanese girl who is sold by her desperate father into slavery along with her older sister Satsu. Because of the unusual gray color of her eyes, Chiyo is sold to an okiya in Kyoto, i.e., a boardinghouse for geishas, while her sister is sold into prostitution elsewhere. Chiyo uses any means she can to reunite with her sister, but she is constantly defeated and punished by the okiya mother until Mameha, a legendary geisha of the hanamachi (geisha district) takes an interest in developing Chiyo into a geisha. Chiyo undergoes a grueling but relatively speedy apprenticeship, and men become bewitched by her poise and subservient manner.Taking a new name, Sayuri, to symbolize her metamorphosis into a professional geisha, she also gains a vindictive adversary in beautiful but spiteful Hatsumomo, the okiya's star geisha. In fact, Sayuri surpasses Hatsumomo in stature, but her victory is short-lived as Japan is in the midst of war and the entire hanamachi is evacuated. Fortunes are lost, but the post-WWII American occupation brings new and not entirely welcome opportunities. This is where both the book and movie drag somewhat since the plot machinations evolve into more of a generic soap opera of compromise and comeuppance. Fortunately, Marshall - along with co-screenwriters Robin Swicord and Doug Wright - excise the book's long denouement of Sayuri moving to New York to run a salon for visiting Japanese businessmen.Unsurprisingly, the film's period detail is impressive, even though it was mostly shot here in California with Kyoto's Gion district recreated in Thousand Oaks (I would agree that the current Gion district looks too modern and commercial to be used effectively now). A bevy of first-rate talent has been recruited to develop the evocative atmosphere of mid-century Japan - John Myhre's production design, Colleen Atwood's costumes (the kimonos are indeed exquisite), Dion Beebe's cinematography and John Williams' evocative music score are all stunning contributions.The movie is dominated by the three female leads, none Japanese, but their individual talents and combined star wattage allay any major miscasting error. Ziyi Zhang certainly looks the part of Sayuri, virginal yet seductive, and she plays the central role with requisite quietude. With her shopworn beauty and throaty voice, Michelle Yeoh fully captures the meditative wisdom of Mameha, as she seems completely credible as the hanamachi's leading geisha. A stunning beauty that threatens to cause an imbalance to the story, Gong Li is a knockout as Hatsumomo with a gift for conveying venal behavior that makes you want to know more about her character.Because of the decision to have the dialogue almost completely in English (instead of subtitled), Yeoh comes off the smoothest, while both Zhang and Li seem at times to be speaking a little too phonetically to be fully immersed in their roles. Ken Watanabe makes a charismatic Chairman, the object of Sayuri's lifelong desires, though his scenes feel a bit truncated. Other roles are presented in rather broad strokes - Kji Yakusho is suitably gruff and insensitive as Nobu; Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa brings a nicely sinister edge to the Baron; Youki Kudoh undergoes the most dramatic transformation as the secondary apprentice geisha, Pumpkin; and Kaori Momoi is coldly effective as the mercenary okiya mother with the forever-propped cigarette.Although I enjoyed the film and don't mind the Oscar-baiting nature of the approach here, a part of me does wish that a Yasujiro Ozu or a Mikio Naruse were still alive to do his own adaptation of the book, as I feel their subtle, native Japanese filmmaking  techniques could have brought a more authentic feeling to the film. I can only imagine what a Setsuko Hara or a Machiko Ky could have done with the role of Sayuri in their prime, but I'm just happy Marshall and company have brought Golden's book to the screen with such dedicated if a bit overly commercial spirit.",4,Entertaining and Evocative But Also Episodic and Sometimes Cursory Look at One Geisha's Life,1134604800,"12 15, 2005",2005,4723,"['Taken', 'own',

The film was a little anticlimatic, and honestly not as original as it could have been.

I view their sacrifice as heroic and to be revered. (That was just a personal note).I also have to say something about the cinematography. Every scene is so exquisite and artfully shot that a photo capture in any scene would be beautiful enough to stand as a work of art.

169040,AXFI7TAWD6H6X,1404983082,Erica Anderson,"[0, 0]","""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is one of my all time favorite novels. I love Japanese culture and am particularly fascinated by geishas. So imagine how thrilled I was when the film rights to the book was sold a few years ago. At first I thought the film would never get made but it has and finally been released on the big screen.The story revolves around Chiyo/Sayuri, a young girl who was sold off to a geisha house around the 1930s (which was common in that era). Chiyo is subjected to hardships and the cruelty of Hatsumono (the stunning Gong Li), the resident geisha. One fateful day, a young Chiyo meets her destiny in the form of the Chairman played by the handsome Ken Watanabe which eventually inspires her to become a geisha.The film remains pretty faithful to the book but of course there were a few holes in the novel. I really didn't care for the use of the english language through out the film. It made the story less convincing. Whoever decided to shoot the film in english was too cheap and lazy to shoot it in Japanese. Does anyone honestly think that the Japanese actually spoke english in the 1930s and '40s? The character Pumpkin (Sayuri's housemate) spoke in perfect english which hade it harder for me to believe that Pumpkin was Japanese. I have to admit I was bit wary of the use of a mostly Chinese cast. Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh were better than I expected. I wasn't completely convinced by Ziyi Zhang but then again I am not a big fan of her as an actress. Still I think Rob Marshall disrespected the Japanese culture by not hiring more Japanese actors. Maybe he should have read the book and studied Japanese culture a bit more.The scenery was gorgeous. Hard to believe that the film was shot mostly in Los Angeles with a few selected scenes in Japan. John Williams' score was actually good but it was Yo Yo Ma's contributions that gave the music depth.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed Memoirs of a Geisha. It isn't perfect by all means but I thought it was fairly decent and actually stayed pretty close to the novel.",3,"Beautiful setting, storyline lacking",1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2035,"['Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'novels', 'love', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'am', 'particularly', 'fascinated', 'geishas', 'So', 'imagine', 'how', 'thrilled', 'was', 'when', 'film', 'rights', 'book', 'was', 'sold', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'thought', 'film', 'would', 'never', 'get', 'made', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'big', 'screen.The', 'story', 'Chiyo/Sayuri', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'sold', 'off', 'geisha', 'house', '1930s', 'was', 'common', 'era', 'Chiyo', 'subjected', 'hardships', 'cruelty', 'Hatsumono', 'stunning', 'Gong', 'Li', 'resident', 'geisha', 'One', 'fateful', 'day', 'young', 'Chiyo', 'destiny', 'form', 'Chairman', 'played', 'handsome', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'eventually', 'become', 'geisha.The', 'film', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'book', 'course', 'were', 'few', 'holes', 'novel', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'use', 'english', 'language', 'film', 'made', 'story', 'less', 'convincing', 'decided', 'shoot', 'film', 'english', 'was', 'too', 'cheap', 'lazy', 'shoot', 'Japanese', 'anyone', 'honestly', 'think', 'Japanese', 'actually', 'spoke', 'english', '1930s', ""'40s"", 'character', 'Pumpkin', 'Sayuri', 'housemate', 'spoke', 'perfect', 'english', 'hade', 'harder', 'believe', 'Pumpkin', 'was', 'Japanese', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'bit', 'wary', 'use', 'mostly', 'Chinese', 'cast', 'Gong', 'Li', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'were', 'better', 'expected', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'convinced', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'then', 'again', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'actress', 'Still', 'think', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'disrespected', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'not', 'hiring', 'more', 'Japanese', 'actors', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'studied', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'bit', 'more.The', 'scenery', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'Hard', 'believe', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mostly', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'few', 'selected', 'scenes', 'Japan', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'was', 'Yo', 'Yo', 'Ma', 'contributions', 'gave', 'music', 'flaws', 'enjoyed', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'means', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'decent', 'actually', 'stayed', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel']",N/A
169041,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,1404983082,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[23, 27]","Rob Marshall the director engaged the author Arthur Golden to assist in making his book come to life on the screen. It is a visually stunning artistic masterpiece. The landscapes of Japan are shown in their exotic magnificence with long shots and skilled cinematography. The entire story can not be put on screen but the most unique and intriguing aspects of Chiyo's story were chosen and come to life. Chiyo is a young girl of 9 years who is sold along with her sister to a Geisha house in Kyoto, to be trained for the Geisha lifestyle. Her mother is ill and dies. Her father, a simple fisherman, can not cope with raising two young daughters. He does what he thinks is best to ensure their place in the world.Chiyo has distinctive alluring eyes which set her apart from her peers - they will likely ensure her popularity and fame, if she develops the skills associated with the geisha training. Her eyes create jealousy in the Geisha named Hatsumomo, whose working skills and talents provide the money to support the lives of everyone associated with the establishment which bought Chiyo. A rivalry develops within the establishement over who will be chosen as successor to Mamasan/Mother, the owner of the Geisha house.  Mother had no daughters of her own. She keeps Hatsumomo and the geisha trainees guessing as to her plans. She is a skilled businesswoman and plays her cards very close-fisted ...Chiyo feels locked up and imprisoned in the Geisha establishment. She wants very badly to see her sister, Satsu. Hatsumomo, the head Geisha uses this knowledge against Chiyo. Hatsumomo is a selfish spoiled Geisha -she treats the young trainees badly as she looks to satisfy her every whim. Chiyo manages to escape the establishment looking for her sister and by pure chance meets a kindly gentleman in the park who lends her his handkerchief and is the first person to show her kindness since she came to Kyoto. She never forgets his face and longs to meet him again ... when she is full-fledged Geisha ...Her wishes come true much later ... In this instance, despite being punished for escaping the establishement, some kind of miracle brought Mameha, a very famous Geisha to ask to train Chiyo. She takes her under her wing and Chiyo becomes Mameha's ""little sister"". A strong rivalry develops between Hatsumomo and her little sister nick-named ""Pumpkin"" (due to her round face) and Mameha and Chiyo. Mameha has connections and uses various techniques to bring Chiyo to the attention of famous patrons of the Tea houses where the Geisha perform and entertain. Chiyo is renamed ""Sayuri"" and performs a beguiling dance for the patrons at a party which establishes her as ready for ""bidding"" ... Very wealthy patrons bid for the right to her ""mizuage"" (virginity). The higher the price, the more famous and established a Geisha she becomes. Mameha uses her expertise to ensure Chiyo/Sayuri's bids go higher and higher. Hatsumomo uses all her power to try to prevent this and get Pumpkin her ""little sister"" to be the most popular and recognized newest Geisha ... Through Mameha's help, Sayuri manages to gain recognition and bring in high bids. Her fame is established. She does indeed meet the Chairman, the man who was kind to her in the park whom she discovers is the Director of the Imawura Electric Company. But due to his personal relationship and honor debt which he owes to his partner Nobu, it is Nobu with whom Sayuri must develop and cultivate a friendship ... Sayuri's rivalary with Pumpkin continues as Sayuri's popularity triumphs. The complexity of their rivalry causes grief and heartache to Sayuri ... as Pumpkin knows exactly the right time to strike a blow to her former friend's plans. This film provides a historically accurate portrayal of the lives of the Geisha at a time when world political events come crashing down on Japanese society. The changing  social and economic structure of the country affects the lives of everyone in ways unimaginable. Fortunately, the conclusion of World War II brings about good fortune for Sayuri and her relationship with the beloved Chairman of her dreams ...Gong Li plays Hatsumomo to perfection, it is excellent casting. The young Chinese girls who play Chiyo and Pumpkin are superb in their roles. Ziyi Zhang plays the adult Chiyo/Sayuri with great depth of feeling and is highly believable as perhaps the most famous Geisha of Kyoto ... Unfortunately, Michelle Yeoh who plays Mameha comes off as too business-like, she does not exude the beauty and charm which are attributed to her character. Occasionally, the story is told in a two-dimensional manner which makes the characters seem less warm and a bit distant. This is why I deducted one star. Never-the-less, overall this film is a tremendously beautiful production worth viewing. The subject matter and cinematography over-ride any other considerations. This film is an intriguing and wonderful entry into the well kept secret of the Geisha lifestyle. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",4,Extremely Beautiful and Exotic ...

However, when finally agreeing to view this film I was very surprised. I found this to be a very inspiring, delicate and a brilliantly directed film. Set in 1929 Japan, a nine-year-old girl is sold to a geisha house, is subjected to cruel treatment from the owners and the head geisha/villian named Hatsumomo. Her stunning beauty attracts the vindictive jealousy of Hatsumomo, until she is rescued by and taken under the wing of Hatsumomo's bitter rival, Mameha. Under Mameha's mentorship, the young girl becomes the geisha named Sayuri, trained in all the artistic and social skills a geisha must master in order to survive in her society. As a renowned geisha she enters a society of wealth, privilege, and political intrigue. She soon becomes one of Japan's most popular and well known geishas, and as World War II looms over Japan, the geisha's world is forever changed by the onslaught of history.The things that make this film great are (of course) the story, the acting, characters, pace and direction. With a great cast playing the film's strong characters, the acting is one of this film's highlights.The main character is Sayuri played by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'/'House of Flying Daggers' actress Ziyi Zhang, the villian Hatsumomo played by Li Gong who is now in 'Miami Vice', the Chairman played by 'The Last Samurai's' Ken Watanabe and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa from 'Mortal Kombat' as the Baron.The pace of Memoirs of a Geisha is quite quick, keeping the viewer watching as the plot blooms and drama continues.The direction from Rob Marshall is truely brilliant and the best thing about this film. With radiating beautiful colours, stunning set pieces and marvelous backdrops of 1929 Japan, Rob Marshall captures the Japanese social and civil life down to perfection. At first, I asumed that this film was directed by a Japanese director, but it is still hard to believe that this film was directed by the same director of the useless Chicago.Truely this is a fascinating film. Beautiful to look at and filled with emotion from its characters. Especially from the scene at the end were Sayuri finally embraces with her love interest in a tear jerking moment of emotion.

I thought the scenery (especially of the Japanese market) was well portrayed.Although the film is visually stunning, I felt that it could have been made more authentic if it had more Japanese actors and people speaking in Japanese; most of the actors in the film appeared to be Chinese (I guess a lot of people wouldn't pick up on that) and the film was in English.It's difficult to relate the life of Sayuri/ Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang) in detail, but the film made a good attempt of showing how she lived and making the audience feel compassion towards her.The story captures the life of Chiyo, a grey-eyed Japanese girl, who along with her sister, is sold by her parents as a result of poverty. Upon arrival at a Geisha house, the sisters are separated and Chiyo succumbs to her new role as a servant for the dominating Mother.Hatsumomo (Gong Li) the Geisha of the house, develops a dislike for Chiyo and begins to make life difficult for her.

169045,A2ORMBJU6V5UV5,1404983082,"Fleseastorm ""SAS""","[5, 10]","This movie was outstanding. The acting was superb. The Script took liberties but I was able to look past those. This film was one of the best movies I have ever seen. After reading the book last June, I was suddenly transported into a world I knew nothing about. that world was the world of Geisha. Memoirs of a Geisha was the first time I had ever tried to understand that world. The book was fantastic. The movie is no exception. I found Michelle yoeh to be the best of all the actresses in this movie. she had a perfect balance of motherly qualities, but when she needs to, she can be a ferocious lioness. Ziyi Zhang is stunningly beautiful, but her performance is a tad bit mundane. I could never really feel her heartbreak like I could in 2046, where her abilities as an actress surpassed every expectation I could ever have. My feeling is that although she is a fantastic actress, (she has come a long way since the road home), the English language is very difficult for her to master in a way that expresses her emotions. In this film she is trying to express a Hong Kong culture version of emotion, whereas she should be trying a English version. Gong Li out shinned the rest of the cast as the catty Hotsumomo. Her performance was flawless, and it called to mind a ""mean girls"" meets ""mommy dearest"" quality. Hotsumomo added most of the drama to this tale. she was constantly using her gift of wit to break sayuri. Ken Wantanabi plays a perfect Chairman. He is Oscar worthy as a man who feels compassion for a young girl, than later as a man torn between wanting a woman's love that he can never have, and holding back his deep desires. This role outshines his Oscar nominated role in the last samurai. The drama makes this movie a true masterpiece, but the romance slows it down a bit. The love story is not bad, but the dramatic scenes that are created because of that love make this tale stay one step ahead of falling flat. The look of the movie is as beautiful as any I have ever seen. it has a dream-like essence. that is because of the amazing cinematography and glossy look.

169046,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,1404983082,Frodo,"[2, 4]","Disclaimer: I have not read the book, so my review is based only upon my feelings on the film.I never even thought I'd see ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" let alone like it. I've never REALLY been a fan of Asian cinema... I just didn't understand the hype of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""House of Flying Daggers."" Until now. A twist of luck presented me with the chance to see this film. Half-heartedly I sat down at the television and watched with a group of my close friends this movie, and for the first time I understood WHY this genre of film has captivated the Western World.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" captured a profound beauty and innocence of the Japanese Geisha women, which is ironic. For those who don't know what a Geisha is (as I didn't beforehand) they are women who turn their bodies into artistic dances to impress interested men. It's legalised prostitution, basically, and the Geisha's virginity that is auctioned off. Naturally, the film is about the exploitment of this beauty while one determined Geisha (played by Zihi Zhang) keeps her dreams of finding love and respect alive.Personally, the reason I loved this film so much was because of it is SO STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL to watch. I find it difficult to recall a more visually-sublime movie. The film itself is like a dance; a beautiful harmony of rich colour and sweeping cinematography. Every scene just melts into the next. Particular brilliant scenes include Zihi Zhang's transformation into a Geisha, which said a thousand words with hardly any words at all. Another scene is when she performs her interpretive dance which made my spine tingle with electricity. And when she's standing on the cliff and the camera pans out... WOW!! I know I'm getting very carried away with myself right now, but I can't get over it! This is basically how I have come to respect these types of films so much now. Words cannot describe!But ""Memoirs"" certainly doesn't go without its flaws. Because I was so entranced by its beauty, I think my attention was drawn away from the actual storyline. I found the plot difficult to follow. I think there was a bit of an inbalance, where too much of the story was left to prior-knowledge. I had difficulty drawing links bewteen certain characters and their significance in the film and so on. It's a shame too, because the film's script is so poetic and wonderful. Of course, I had a general idea of the story, but I was lost on some of those minor yet significant nooks and crannies that bring the film full circle.Also, I do question whether, being made by an American director, if the story's lack in continuity was because a non-Japanese filmmaker couldn't FULLY understand the deep themes of the film. I'm not trying to put down Rob Marshall, who I AM a fan of, and I think he did a great job, but I think ""Memoirs"" certainly lacked an authentic edge that ""Crouching Tiger"" for instance had.Nevertheless, I really enjoyed ""Memoirs"" and it has really changed my opinion, and I suppose prejudice, on Asian-themed cinema. It has introduced me to a new respect for that culture completely. The score by John Williams, by the way, is wonderful as usual, so that gave it an extra bite. The storyline and its clarity falls flat. But its winning aspect is definately the art direction, costumes and cinematography, which deservingly won Oscars respectively.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a moving tale of a woman's value and how one Geisha broke conformity and not only found love, but felt it too.",4,"Visually STUNNING, but story was difficult to follow",1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3484,"['Disclaimer', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'review', 'based', 'only', 'feelings', 'film.I', 'never', 'even', 'thought', ""'d"", 'see', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'let', 'alone', ""'ve"", 'never', 'REALLY', 'been', 'fan', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'hype', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'now', 'twist', 'luck', 'presented', 'chance', 'see', 'film', 'Half-heartedly', 'sat', 'down', 'television', 'watched', 'group', 'close', 'friends', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'understood', 'WHY', 'genre', 'film', 'captivated', 'Western', 'World', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'captured', 'profound', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'Japanese', 'Geisha', 'women', 'ironic', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'Geisha', 'did', ""n't"", 'beforehand', 'are', 'women', 'who', 'turn', 'bodies', 'artistic', 'dances', 'impress', 'interested', 'men', 'legalised', 'prostitution', 'basically', 'Geisha', 'virginity', 'auctioned', 'off', 'Naturally', 'film', 'exploitment', 'beauty', 'one', 'determined', 'Geisha', 'played', 'Zihi', 'Zhang', 'dreams', 'finding', 'love', 'respect', 'alive.Personally', 'reason', 'loved', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'SO', 'STUNNINGLY', 'BEAUTIFUL', 'watch', 'find', 'difficult', 'recall', 'more', 'visually-sublime', 'movie', 'film', 'dance', 'beautiful', 'harmony', 'rich', 'colour', 'sweeping', 'cinematography', 'Every', 'scene', 'just', 'melts', 'next', 'Particular', 'brilliant', 'scenes', 'include', 'Zihi', 'Zhang', 'transformation', 'Geisha', 'said', 'thousand', 'words', 'hardly', 'words', 'scene', 'when', 'interpretive', 'dance', 'made', 'spine', 'tingle', 'electricity', 'when', 'standing', 'cliff', 'camera', 'out', 'WOW', 'know', ""'m"", 'getting', 'very', 'carried', 'away', 'right', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'basically', 'how', 'have', 'come', 'respect', 'types', 'films', 'so', 'much', 'now', 'Words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'Memoirs', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'go', 'flaws', 'was', 'so', 'entranced', 'beauty', 'think', 'attention', 'was', 'drawn', 'away', 'actual', 'storyline', 'found', 'plot', 'difficult', 'follow', 'think', 'was', 'bit', 'inbalance', 'where', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'was', 'left', 'prior-knowledge', 'had', 'difficulty', 'drawing', 'links', 'bewteen', 'certain', 'characters', 'significance', 'film', 'so', 'shame', 'too', 'film', 'script', 'so', 'poetic', 'wonderful', 'course', 'had', 'general', 'idea', 'story', 'was', 'lost', 'minor', 'yet', 'significant', 'nooks', 'crannies', 'bring', 'film', 'full', 'circle.Also', 'do', 'question', 'being', 'made', 'American', 'director', 'story', 'lack', 'continuity', 'was', 'non-Japanese', 'filmmaker', 'could', ""n't"", 'FULLY', 'understand', 'deep', 'themes', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'put', 'down', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'who', 'AM', 'fan', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'think', 'Memoirs', 'certainly', 'lacked', 'authentic', 'edge', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'instance', 'had.Nevertheless', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Memoirs', 'really', 'changed', 'opinion', 'suppose', 'prejudice', 'Asian-themed', 'cinema', 'introduced', 'new', 'respect', 'culture', 'completely', 'score', 'John', 'Williams', 'way', 'wonderful', 'usual', 'gave', 'extra', 'bite', 'storyline', 'clarity', 'flat', 'winning', 'aspect', 'definately', 'art', 'direction', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'deservingly', 'won', 'Oscars', 'respectively', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'moving', 'tale', 'woman', 'value', 'how', 'one', 'Geisha', 'broke', 'conformity', 'not', 'only', 'found', 'love', 'felt', 'too']",N/A
169047,AVEVNXZGYY2CE,1404983082,GadgetChick,"[3, 6]","I really enjoyed the book, Memoirs of a Geisha, by Arthur Goldman. Although the plot was pretty cliche, what made it charming and fascinating was the author's use of language - in particular, the wonderful descriptions and his use of metaphor. The dialogue in the book wasn't always masterful but it was head and shoulders above the dialogue in the movie. I appreciate that the producers were using actors who had limited command of the English language and because almost all of the female characters (and all of the female leads) were Chinese and not Japanese, they couldn't have filmed the movie in Japanese and subtitled it. I still don't think that's an excuse for how terrible the movie's dialogue was. They introduced a narrarator at the beginning of the movie (Sayuri as an older woman) and then gave her almost nothing to do. I don't understand why the narrarator couldn't have been narrarating parts of the story over the long stretches of film that were just action, with no dialogue. Maybe that was done to reinforce themes of Japanese simplicity, but it was a mistake. It just makes it seem as though nothing of importance is happening. The narrarator could have incorporated some of Goldman's beautiful descriptions from the book, but instead you sit watching silent action until the next half-page of dialogue gets spoken. There's so little dialogue in the movie that it almost doesn't seem to have a storyline. Things happen, events move forward and there's very little explanation or transition. Which is not how the book was, at all.The film is visually stunning and the images are unbelievably beautiful, and all of the actresses playing the leads do a good job with what they have to do, which is not much. Because of the lack of dialogue most of the acting is done through body language and facial expressions, which would be fine if the story was more nuanced. With a classic (or cliche, however you choose to view it) love story like this, with simple themes, instinctual and spare acting techniques don't work to move the story along. Again, I think the actresses had to make those choices because apparently most of them had very little command of English. The ending is terrible - the climax comes and then boom! the movie is over. The book goes on to describe what happens after the climax and those few pages are some of the best storytelling in the book. I don't understand why the movie couldn't have incorporated at least some of that. At bare minimum, they should have at least SHOWED the narrarator who's been talking through the whole movie, to contextualize her presence. As it stands, you have no idea, when the movie ends, what happened to Sayuri or why she's speaking to you as an old woman, how old she is, etc.This movie is very pretty and absolutely soulless. I would have loved to see a grittier adaptation using Japanese actresses that was subtitled. As the film was produced, it basically guts all the charm and intrigue out of the story. There's a great story there that could have been told well and with skill. Instead, the movie they ended up with is like a lot of beautiful women - nice to look at, sure, but with no substance.

169053,A328S9RN3U5M68,1404983082,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","Why there is so much polarity with the audiences of Rob Marshall's cinematic adaptation of Arthur Golden's exquisite novel MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is puzzling. Even in the theater there were those who left halfway through - reason unknown.  Despite disagreements on the casting techniques and on the emphasis changes between the book and the film, MEMOIRS remains one of the most visually arresting, genteel films of the year.  That it comes across as somewhat of an epic soap opera is no one's fault but the writers.  And what is so wrong with an old-fashioned soap opera of a story afterall?The opening scene of the turbulent sea and heavy rain that accompany the silent selling of two poor sisters to a merchant planning to place the girls in houses in Osaka gives an indication of the importance of water in this story.  The sisters are delivered to a house of geishas and only one is selected by the hard madam.  Through years of suffering and anguish the chosen one becomes a geisha, finds comfort from her childhood of poverty, gains loving mentoring by a top geisha, becomes the most sought after geisha in Osaka, finds her love, endures WW II and eventually returns to her dreams.  The interplay between the girl and the various members of the geisha training and bartering complex add flavor and conflict that keep the story flowing.The three principal actresses - Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, and Gong Li carry the film well. The large cast includes favorite actors Ken Watanabe and Mako.  The settings are splendid, the special effects such as the cherry blossoms, the autumnal reunion of Zhang and Watanabe, Zhang's spellbinding dance - all are brilliant.  John Williams' musical score blends the best of Japanese folk music with contemporary writing and is greatly abetted by the talent of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzak Perlman.Part of the brilliance of Golden's novel was the meticulous explanation of the myriad details of geisha training and demeanor and makeup and tradition, and while the film version touches on these, the bulk of them are passed over.  For this viewer there is a problem with understanding the dialogue due to the enunciation by the actors and the covering of much of the dialogue with ambient music.  But that is a minor complaint.  In all, MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is an enormously beautiful and affecting film, one that multiple viewings will no doubt enhance the viewers' appreciation.  Recommended.

I had listened to most of the audio version, and was looking forward to the visual depiction of the story, a story which I found quite compelling in its simplicity.  The first concern that I had upon viewing the movie was that moviegoers who had not listened to the audiocassette or read the novel would have been somewhat confused by the chain of events. The movie starts out with the girls being pulled away from their home, and only briefly do we see a man standing at the train station watching them leave. In the novel and in the audio version, it was clear that Mr. Tanaka (spelling?) had made financial arrangements with the girls' father to have the sisters brought to the city because he had seen nine-year-old Chiyo in the small fishing village and been intrigued by her beautiful blue-gray eyes, thinking that she could be an enchanting geisha when she matured.  This is not made clear in the movie.  Other than that, it appears to follow the plot fairly well.  The movie is visually captivating but also very dark at times (perhaps because the geishas spend so much time inside and go out to teahouses at night only).The movie, however, does not stir any lasting emotion or impression. It is a sad story with little joy, and only the last few moments (and here the setting is bright and alive and stunningly beautiful) of the movie suggest that Sayuri (the grown up Chiyo) will have any pleasure in her life.  The movie does drag on at points.  All in all, a good movie, but you may wonder as I and my friends did why we opted for this movie instead of another movie that was playing at the same time.

This very cruel transition puts Chiyo at the mercy of an evil rival and a conniving guardian who torture and enslave her.With all this misery, Chiyo's skies brighten up when she meets an older man (Ken Watanabe of The Last Samurai) that becomes her secret angel and inspiration. She determines to become what she hates the most (a geisha) just so that she could be near him, only to realize that what brought her closer to him is what's keeping her from having him completely to herself.This breathtakingly beautiful film is a masterpiece in filmmaking.

But no historical documentary, please. This tragic fate is seen through the life of a geisha. A pathetic indeed geisha. Sold by her parents who died shortly after, taken away from her older sister, fooled and exploited by an older geisha, beaten by the Madame of the house, salvaged by a businessman, educated, named, renamed and launched by another mature geisha, she has to go through the initiation rites including the sale of her ? value ? to the highest bidder, which sounds like some slave market. After the war, after Hiroshima and its planes, she is needed again to get, squeeze or even extort dollars from the Americans, which looks very much like servile prostitution or perambulating servility. And she ends up as the geisha of the businessman, the mistress and social show-window of the man, the woman he will show in public, though his real wife is invisible. The woman is thus nothing but a well-educated and perfectly-tamed object that some call a geisha. That's a full social and cultural program emerging from the far away past that is profoundly decomposed without enabling us to know whether the film is nostalgic about it, advocates a go-back- to-basics policy or exposes, debunks and denounces this entirely run-down alienation.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit?

169071,A2HCU3HYEYJELG,1404983082,"James Gebhardt ""Film Addict""","[7, 8]","I really wanted to love this film and write a wonderful glowing review but alas, I can't. It had some of my favorite actors including Ziyi Zhang (Hero, Crouching Tiger and House of Flying Daggers), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Twin Warriors) and Gong Li (Raise the Red Lantern, 2046 and The Story of Qiu Ju). My biggest complaint about the film is that it was directed by Rob Marshall and I feel that he was a poor choice for a number of reasons. First of all, he's a great American director who's more at home making ""over the top"" productions (e.g. Annie and Chicago) with large sets and large numbers of actors in any given scene as opposed to Geisha which was more introspective and personal. In Geisha, there were a lot more ""one on one"" exchanges and the stage numbers were on a much smaller scale. The only time he seemed effective was during Sayuri's (Ziyi Zhang) ""snowstorm"" performance which ended up being my favorite scene. Although it was a wonderful performance, it was not a genuine Geisha-style performance. That lack of authenticity hurt the film and it is owed to the fact that American born Marshall lacks Asian insight and natural Asian instincts. By doing the ""snowstorm"" performance it seemed like he was reverting back to what he knew best - not being subtle. The foundation of all Japanese culture lies in its subtlety. This is something that Mameha stressed to Chiyo as she learned to become a Geisha herself. Subtlety in language and mannerisms above all else. If Marshall stays away from projects like this and sticks with the Annies and the Chicagos he could very well become the next Busby Berkley. Just as actors need to be selective about their projects so should directors. But enough about that. Ultimately, the film should've been directed by an Asian director like Ang Lee or Zhang Yimou. Hey here's a crazy idea ... how about a Japanese director! There's a lot of great Japanese directors out there. These other directors would've been better able to convey the subtle Japanese elements that would've provided the much-needed authenticity that the film sorely lacked.I thought Gong Li was excellent in her portrayal of the veteran/rival Geisha, Hatsumomo. The fact that Gong Li was able to exude sympathy and pathos from an otherwise unlikable character such as Hatsumomo is a testament to her greatness as an actress. A lesser actress would have played Hatsumomo as a straightforward villianess and not the woman of complexity as revealed by Li. In the end, the aging Hatsumomo is a sad, lonely woman to be pitied and not vilified. Michelle Yeoh was also wonderful as the retired Geisha, Mameha who taught and mentored the young and impressionable Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang). I liked the scene where the ""Chairman"" (Ken Wantanabe) first met young Chiyo and bought her a cherry ice. While she was sitting and enjoying it, she looked over and saw the Geishas for the first time and they were standing there in the most perfect pose - knees slightly bent and umbrellas over the shoulder. There was a strong sense of epiphany conveyed at that moment by the director for two reasons: First, was the beginning of Chiyo's life-long relationship (obsession maybe?) with the Chairman and second was her infatuation and fascination with the Geisha lifestyle. Marshall also aptly conveyed the tragic elements of the Chiyo/Chairman relationship very well. The honor and dignity that the Chairman bestowed to his fellow businessman and friend by stepping back and allowing him to court Chiyo instead of himself. How difficult it must have been for him to supress his own feelings out of a sense of obligation to the man who saved his life and who suffered permanent disfiguration as a result. It was a well-handled facet of the storyline. I also liked the scene where young Chiyo was running through the arches adorned with red fabric that billowed in the wind. It was nice to see the scene revisited at the end of the film as a flashback. It was a very touching and poignant scene. The scene was a perfect blend of sound, vision and energy. Couldn't ask for more than that! Still, my favorite scene was the ""snowstorm"" performance. I was really caught up in the moment. I sat at the edge of my seat as she carefully inched out on those ""way too high"" platform shoes. Not only was she precariously balanced at that moment. So too was her entire future career as a successful star Geisha. Would she be successful or would she fall flat on her face? It was a wonderful bit of allegory. I also like how Chiyo the Geisha, now known as Sayuri spoke in metaphorical phrases. She was subtle, sophisticated but straight to the point.All in all, I liked the film even though it lacked authenticity. The film had way too many California shooting locations, use of Chinese actors to play the principal Japanese characters which angered many from what I read. Although the performances were credible, I agree that it's a bit too insensitive. I think the film should've been filmed completely in Japan and preferably Kyoto (Japan's capitol before Tokyo) which seems to be the heart of the Geisha culture. Some scenes were indeed shot in Kyoto but, not enough. Although the film had many touching moments, I felt that it lacked a true emotional core. Even after the second viewing, I hold firm on this position. Some critics have compared the film to a Japanese vase ... beautiful, delicate but empty. I think that's a harsh analogy but a little true nonetheless. The post WWII section could have been trimmed down some as well. That's when the film really lost momentum for me.Although the film was worth watching, I would probably recommend just reading the book (upon which the film was based) and move on to something else. If you want to see Gong Li in a great film, I would strongly recommend that you pick up ""Raise the Red Lantern"" by Zhang Yimou. Here, she portrays Songlian - a young Chinese woman forced to marry a wealthly Lord and become one of his four wives. It is a heartwrenching tale of love, loyalty and betrayal. A lot more insight, historically accurate, beautifully filmed and full of first-rate performances.",3,Good film but...,1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,6136,"['really', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'write',

169072,A2RZUFRYRHTRS8,1404983082,jasoneducator,"[7, 18]","I believe this is my first one-star rating in well over a hundred Amazon reviews. As a rule, I'm kind of tough on movies, but this one was a really, really tough sell for me. I'm a guy and that probably biases me against movies and stories like this. And it's been awhile since I've picked up a DVD movie to watch through. My girlfriend wanted to see this, though, so I took one for the team and rented it. By the way, both my girlfriend and I read the book. I dug the book and I expected the movie would be subtle yet sensual.I'll agree with other reviewers that the film is visually appealing. There were also a couple of strong characters capably acted. I thought the performance of the Geisha who tormented Chiyo was powerful. I also developed great empathy for the scarred man who first falls in love with Chiyo. Plotwise, the rivalry between the established Geisha's was the most compelling story. The romance between the Chairman and the main character was a little weird for me. Romance between an established leader and a 9-10 year old proto-Geisha? In the novel, I believed in this central romance a lot more than I did in a the movie.Ultimately, though I'm giving this movie one star because it mucks up a superb story. It is way too long! Moreover, I feel that this would have been far more capably told if it had been directed by someone who *felt* the story more. This is supposed to be either a great romance with subtlety and characters that we the audience falls in love with. Or it's dramatic portrayal of a culture far from our own.

169073,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,1404983082,Jason,"[0, 0]","Whenever there is a highlighted, foreign-themed movie in Hollywood, there is often undue praise - simply for the fact that it's far from the typical American-centric aspect of most movies.  In the case of Memoirs of a Geisha, it's quite possible that the adoration is justified, and I'm kicking myself for not watching this sooner.Powerful enough in and of itself, the movie tells the story of a young girl named Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang) who endures incredible hardships through life.  Sold at a young age to be a geisha, placed in a power struggle against other geishas, and facing countless obstacles in her rise to being a powerful, elegant geisha named Sayuri - the most sought after of all - the timeline and transformation from Chiyo to SAYURI is breathtaking.  Training with the elegant and patient Mameha (Michelle Yeoh), and later against Hatsumomo (Li Gong) - a character as gorgeous as she is vicious - forges Sayuri's will to succeed.  Additionally, the climb to the top gets her involved and rubbing elbows with a Baron (the always interesting Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), for whom she immediately feels strong feelings.  The true stars of this movie, however, may not even be the collection of beautiful actresses; but, instead, everything inanimate.Slightly overshadowing the actors are the glamorous costumes, and extravagant manner in which the geisha are adorned and decorated.  To see their presence is to almost understand how they were able to capture men's attention with a mere glance.  Additional credit must be given to the outstanding cinematography and musical score, as nearly every scene is a stunning sight or sound that only amplifies the beauty of Asian culture.Incredibly well told and acted, detailed and mysterious at the same time, it's an original movie that delves into a somewhat secretive culture not too far removed, and in many ways still prevalent in the patriarchal Japanese society.  It's one of the more exotic and beautiful movies ever made.  The only downside I could see was the mix-up of Asian races, and the unfortunately necessity of making actresses speak broken English rather than Japanese (because most of the main stars are Chinese).",4,This film is as Geisha are intended: Beautiful,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2210,"['Whenever', 'highlighted', 'foreign-themed', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'undue', 'praise', 'simply', 'fact', 'far', 'typical', 'American-centric', 'aspect', 'most', 'movies', 'case', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'quite', 'possible', 'adoration', 'justified', ""'m"", 'kicking', 'not', 'watching', 'sooner.Powerful', 'enough', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Chiyo', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'who', 'incredible', 'hardships', 'life', 'Sold', 'young', 'age', 'be', 'geisha', 'placed', 'power', 'struggle', 'other', 'geishas', 'facing', 'countless', 'obstacles', 'rise', 'being', 'powerful', 'elegant', 'geisha', 'named', 'Sayuri', 'most', 'sought', 'timeline', 'transformation', 'Chiyo', 'SAYURI', 'breathtaking', 'Training', 'elegant', 'patient', 'Mameha', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'later', 'Hatsumomo', 'Li', 'Gong', 'character', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'vicious', 'Sayuri', 'will', 'succeed', 'Additionally', 'climb', 'top', 'involved', 'rubbing', 'elbows', 'Baron', 'always', 'interesting', 'Cary-Hiroyuki', 'Tagawa', 'Chairman', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'whom', 'immediately', 'strong', 'feelings', 'true', 'stars', 'movie', 'however', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'collection', 'beautiful', 'actresses', 'instead', 'everything', 'inanimate.Slightly', 'overshadowing', 'actors', 'are', 'glamorous', 'costumes', 'extravagant', 'manner', 'geisha', 'are', 'adorned', 'decorated', 'see', 'presence', 'almost', 'understand', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'capture', 'men', 'attention', 'mere', 'glance', 'Additional', 'credit', 'must', 'be', 'given', 'outstanding', 'cinematography', 'musical', 'score', 'nearly', 'scene', 'stunning', 'sight', 'sound', 'only', 'beauty', 'Asian', 'culture.Incredibly', 'well', 'told', 'acted', 'detailed', 'mysterious', 'same', 'time', 'original', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'secretive', 'culture', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'removed', 'many', 'ways', 'still', 'prevalent', 'patriarchal', 'Japanese', 'society', 'one', 'more', 'exotic', 'beautiful', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'only', 'downside', 'could', 'see', 'was', 'mix-up', 'Asian', 'races', 'unfortunately', 'necessity', 'making', 'actresses', 'speak', 'broken', 'English', 'rather', 'Japanese', 'most', 'main', 'stars', 'are', 'Chinese']",N/A

People have criticized Memoirs just because of its casting, something I find totally silly and downright stupid. The cast of Memoirs is powerful and I would not have picked other actors myself, even if they were all Chinese.Secondly, coming from a person who loved the book, the movie was very faithful, if not too faithful to the book. Many preconceived expectations abound book adaptations and I guess that is the downfall of the movie. It remained too faithful to the point that the inner texture and spirit of the story was somehow lost. It was not translated well on screen even if it was faithful to the original manuscript which is the book. A good example of an exemplary book adaptation would be the Harry Potter series because even though there where chunks of the original details missing in the movie, the film still preserved the central spirit of the text. Going by this line of script writing and screenplay would have made Memoirs a better movie.As a movie itself, not as a book adaptation, Memoirs was beautifully executed. Every frame was lovely to look at: the flowers, the colors, the sounds, the vision of the Oriental scene was lush and vibrant. The production quality was top-notch but that was it. It may have exuded this mysterious Asian aura but it did not follow through. That is the main downfall of the movie. It was aesthetically pleasing but empty.Acting was superb for the most part. Gong Li was a great Hatsumomo and Michelle Yeoh, though lacking Japanese features, was an exceptional Mameha. Ziyi though, was a bit stoic and unfeeling. The young Chio was adorable though and was a good actress even at a young age.Overall, the movie was okay... Beautiful and Theatric, Artsy and lush, but empty.

Its plot, of a young girl sold to become a geisha, is riveting. The film's score, by John Williams, is first rate. And by the end, you learn something about the values of the geisha -- a heightened form of feminine perfection that appealed to Japanese men (and others) through the war years. The movie is set in the years just before and after World War II. Young Chiyo, the daughter of a poor fisherman, is torn from her family and placed in an ""okiyo"" -- home to a geisha and training ground for future geishas. Life is hard and pointless until Chiyo one days meets a powerful businessman who takes an interest in her. Chiyo swears to be part of his entourage. Fate intervenes, and she is taken in by an older geisha who takes an interest in her. A rival geisha plots her downfall.I was fascinated by the way the film depicted the precarious world of the geisha. As an epitome of sexual desire, she was tainted by sexual experience -- real or perceived. Clothed and made up to perfection, she was expected to be demure in the presence of men, but subtly challenging and clever a well. The fine line that women have toed or millennia.A wonderful movie.

This film is the perfect example of a love story done right. I felt that the characters truly felt something for each other and the chemistry between Ken Wantanabe and Ziyi Zhang was believable. Unlike most romance films, you feel that emotions between the two characters are real and don't feel corny. Memoirs of a Geisha is a terrific, well acted film. Probably the only weak point of the film is the casting of two Chinese actresses in the role of the leads, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang. I thought that this film should have had an all Japanese cast, but unfortunately, it didn't. Despite this small flaw, Memoirs of a Geisha is a stunning film that is beautifully acted, directed and told. Not only that, but the film looks stunning. A beautiful film that I believe is one of the best Romance films of the last ten years.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","I was able to watch this film last night and I ask you this...............Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the remote and mysterious world of a geisha? The answer is yes, with stunning beauty ...and regrettable flaws. The basic flaw of the film is the dialogue that feels so foreign it might have been written in another language. The different accents of the cast doesn't help matters because they speak in a sort of British English that is a distraction. I was actually wishing for subtitles at certain points of the film.Truth be told, this movie was not as bad as its trailer led me to expect. It had a story to tell (although it crumbles in the end), images to show, and material to present. There were ample displays of exquisite beauty--the trailing tails of silk kimonos, the subtle allure of hand gestures, and the captivating kabuki theater dance scene...On the other hand, the American director was not able to pull the Japanese out of Chinese actresses. (This movie was so crowded by famous Chinese idols that I found myself inadvertently searching for Joan Chen among the cast.) To be fair, all three main actors (Gong Li in particular) show strong performances that made me sympathetic to Rob Marshall's choices. However, they remain utterly Chinese throughout this movie. The look and accent are not the only problems. They lacked the kind of extreme femininity, excessive felicity, and delicately mechanical gesture, posture, and movements of traditional Japanese ladies you can see in custom dramas of Japanese production. (Michelle Yeoh seems to be the only one trying a little bit of those, but it did not quite work for some reason.)So, let me re-address the question: Can a group of American men and Chinese actresses render the world of a geisha? The answer, I guess, really depends on what you are looking for. If you would like a little bit of delight from an aesthetically pleasing picture with a vague standard for authenticity and realism, this movie delivers it. I would not say Rob Marshall failed completely. Memoirs of a Geisha is not the first, nor the last, movie that subjects another culture to the crude lens of American exoticism.

If you read through the list of the crew, I don't think I saw a single oriental man woman or child except for the actors.  I am sure the film makers did their research, however, this movie would have better been served with a solid Asian director and as a foreign language film with more of an Asian crew as well.  However, as a guy, I really did not want to see the film in the first place-But forced to by my wife.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  Despite the criticism above, the actors were very good, the art direction, cinematography and costumes were brilliant as well as the Oscars gave them all their seal of approval with wins in these three categories.  The director did a fine job (previous job, musical ""Chicago"").  The movie was based on a book, therefore, the research done was probably pretty limited to the book I suspect and there was some controversy with the Chinese as they did not like that their actors playing Japanese Geishas.  The move started with the sale of two children to Geisha houses, then takes a spin towards a Cinderella type story as the main character becomes a slave instead of a prepping to be a Geisha, then she gets her break and the rest is in the movie.  The movie is 145 minutes long and I love action, horror, drama flicks, but I really didn't think I would like this, but I truly did.  Guys, if you want to trick your girl into watching a girl flick, rent this, it was entertaining.  It had a lot of drama, a lot of culture, how true it was, not sure, however, the transition from the Geisha to the Americans invasion was a bit awkward and felt out of place.  I would have just left it at the trials of a Geisha and the rivalry between them and left the American invasion out completely.

Menta, Jr.","[3, 5]","In many ways, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is exactly how you think it is: it is full of beautiful scenery, sensitive music, poetic voiceovers, and the like.  And though predictably present, all those things are well done and enjoyable to sit through.  However, I'm glad to report that there's also a nice little potboiler plot that builds up along the way, as rival geisha plot against one another for control of their house.  That provides a good bit of viewing fun.It's also interesting to note the differences between Western culture and Japanese culture, or at least the culture of the geisha circa World War II.  For example, the ultimate romantic goal of a geisha is to secure one successful and respectable man to be her lifelong sponsor, a man she could dote over and pamper in return for financial security.  Of course, most of the time the men who are most desirable as sponsors are long married with families.  ""Why are these geisha getting all misty eyed over these men who already have wives?"" my wife asked.  ""Don't be judgemental, darling,"" I replied with a smile.If you liked the original book (I listened to the excellent unabridged audiobook version of the story a few years ago and enjoyed it), you'll probably like the movie, which adapts the long novel as well as any normal-length movie probably can.  Also, the two-disc DVD set delivers a generous amount of extra features.In the end, even if this isn't the type of movie you'd normally seek out (I guess I'm mainly talking to the men out there), there's much to enjoy about ""Memoirs of a Geisha"".

I'm Kind Of A ...","[2, 3]",Once again I get to review a film from an amazing novel that I knew nothing about until this film was released. I must say that everything from the story to the visuals are beautiful especially Japan's cherry blossoms and other obvious colorful scenery. One of the few problems I had with the movie was that it wasn't in its original Japanese language with English subtitles.I have become one of those people that appreciate a foreign film especially Asian cinema much more when it is in its original language. It starts to become a little unrealistic when everyone is speaking English in Japan and you can tell that they don't speak it everyday plus there's the fact that they're in Japan. It would only be right to show some appreciation to a culture and story of this kind by letting them speak their language.Maybe it's just me or there is something that I didn't know about the production but I just rented this movie and knew nothing of the novel. The story is very interesting because you finally get some insight on those Japanese masks with the white makeup and red lips. You get the real story of the secret life and you find out that those masks have nothing on the true geisha.It does get a little surprising to see how it was done in those days and shocking how a geisha held power but didn't hold it all in the same. Memoirs Of A Geisha is truly a beautiful film and story as well. The acting was good but what's funny is that Suzuka Ohgo (Young Chiyo) and Zoe Weizenbaum (Young Pumpkin) do a far better job than Ziyi Zhang and Youki Kudoh.

Positioned as a heavyweight Oscar contender last year, it's chances were derailed by generally moderate to unenthusiastic reviews. I, therefore, decided to give it a pass in the theaters and catch it later with fresh eyes. Well, there is good news and bad news with ""Memoirs""--but probably much of what I have to say won't be ""new"" news""Memoirs"" is far from an inept picture. It is absolutely stunning. The visuals, art direction, cinematography, costumes--it's all top notch. Technically speaking, this is a very accomplished film. Anyone who has an interest in these aspects will be greatly rewarded. I, also, thought the performances were quite good. I know there was a bit of controversy about the actual nationalities of the actor's involved--but this was not something that affected my impression of the film. It's not particularly unheard of in Hollywood to put ""name"" talent into your picture. If having these accomplished international actors helped ""Memoirs"" get it's backing, that's just a realistic part of Hollywood as a business.While I did think the performances were dignified, there was just something a little lifeless about the movie. I watched with interest throughout the film, but I never really felt any emotion for the proceedings. It's pretty, but somewhat empty. Only Gong Li as a supercharged villain seemed to be having any fun. I think everyone was so concerned with making an austere ""classic,"" they forgot the energy and the heart and the passion. I wanted to be swept up, but it never happens. I got detached admiration, instead.Look, I'm not going to be super critical. It's a bit unfair when people say the movie has ruined the book, etc. You're always treading dangerous ground when you adapt a beloved novel to the big screen and the inevitable comparisons are often unjust. I'll just say that the film version of ""Memoirs"" had all the potential to be a powerful modern romantic epic. But for all the lessons we get about Geishas, ultimately all we're left with is the protocol and not a glimpse of the real woman underneath the makeup.

The girls are separated, and Chiyo's life is filled with work, punishment, and loneliness,  until the day she meets the Chairman (Ken Watanabe).  The handsome businessman is kind to the little girl, and from that moment she vows to become a geisha so she can see him again.  Chiyo escapes the jealousy of head geisha Hatsumomo (Li Gong), and with the help of her mentor (Michelle Yeoh), she  becomes the most celebrated geisha in the city.  And then WWII changes everything.I hesitated to see this movie because of the criticisms I'd read, but I really enjoyed everything about it.  The costumes and scenery are simply exquisite, the acting is excellent, and the script is powerful and touching.  The story contrasts the harsh life of little Chiyo with the graceful elegance of the geishas, and it's such a visual feast that it was hard to leave the theatre and not see any kimonos.  The best scenes were those with Ken Watanabe, whose confidence and charisma are very appealing.  All of the actors are very good and I really cared about the characters.

I doubt if many people outside of Japan previous to this movie really understood the role of geishas in Japanese history and this film is very good in conveying what geishas actually did and did not do for their clients.The beginning storyline reminds me in certain ways of the great Chinese film ""Farewell My Concubine."" In both films a young child is sold or given away to be trained to be a performer, highly valued in both respective cultures. Also, the young people being trained to be opera performers and geishas are treated with harsh discipline, often cruelty.Sayuri, who becomes the most accomplishe geisha in Kyoto, is a character, as an adult played by Zhang Ziyi, I think all viewers will like and empathize with. The music, especially relating to when Sayuri's storyline is being told, is beautiful and memorable. Three outstanding Chinese actresses are the three main female characters, all playing very accomplished geishas.Be sure to check out the interesting features on the second disc. I was especially interested in the building of the hanamachi, Sayuri's neighborhood in Kyoto and the commentary with John Williams, the composer. It is interesting to note John Williams was so impressed with the book the film is based on, he asked to compose the music.One relatively minor quibble I have about the film that came out in one of the features on the second disc is how the director and his assistants somewhat changed Japanese traditional dance styles, which was apparently intially resisted to some extent by certain Japanese helping to make the film, and slightly changed the kimonos worn by geishas. Their  rationale was they were not making a ""documentary,"" but I would have appreciated it if they had been more true to traditional Japanese culture. Nevertheless the kimonos are beautiful, as is the dancing of the geishas.""Memoir of a Geisha"" is a very good film.

All of the characters are speaking in perfect English. Whoops, my mistake...There is some actual Japanese language used in the film, especially whenever the characters say hello, hi, and goodbye. How formulaic. This film should have been showcased in actual Japanese language, expression, dialect, and dialogue.2. What kind of a director hires Chinese actresses to star in a movie centered in Japan about the Geisha? Where is the logic in that?3. Why is a business chairman (a grown man at that) showing a love interest in a little 9 year old girl?4. Why is a school for elegant hookers glorified the way that it was? This is a film about how a little girl evolves from a slave girl at a slave house, to become the top prostitute....whoops I mean Geisha. Sounds like the remix of Cinderella and Pretty Woman to me. Even though, this is a true story....It fails to capture the actual essence of Japanese culture.5. Much of the film is filmed on Hollywood sets and backdrops, not on location in Japan.6. The only positive attribute that I can give the movie credit for is the beautiful cinematography. As well as how they trained the actresses to walk in those high flip flops. I'm still baffled on how pimps in the 70's walked in those high platform boots with the goldfishes.....just joking.Finally, if you'd like to witness a film about pre and post World War 2 Japan from an American director...with a distant knowledge and regard of The Rising Sun's culture, then I welcome you to go check out Memoirs of a Geisha",2,Disrespectful Film To The Japanese,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1619,"['Here', 'short', 'synopsis', 'why', 'Memoirs', '2', 'stars', 'me.1', 'film', 'presented', 'English', 'characters', 'are', 'speaking', 'perfect', 'English', 'Whoops', 'mistake', 'actual', 'Japanese', 'language', 'used', 'film', 'especially', 'whenever', 'characters', 'say', 'hello', 'hi', 'goodbye', 'How', 'formulaic', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'showcased', 'actual', 'Japanese', 'language', 'expression', 'dialect', 'dialogue.2', 'What', 'kind', 'director', 'Chinese', 'actresses', 'star', 'movie', 'centered', 'Japan', 'Geisha', 'Where', 'logic', '3', 'Why', 'business', 'chairman', 'grown', 'man', 'showing', 'love', 'interest', 'little', '9', 'year', 'old', 'girl', '4', 'Why', 'school', 'elegant', 'hookers', 'glorified', 'way', 'was', 'film', 'how', 'little', 'girl', 'evolves', 'slave', 'girl', 'slave', 'house', 'become', 'top', 'prostitute', 'mean', 'Geisha', 'remix', 'Cinderella', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Even', 'true', 'story', 'fails', 'capture', 'actual', 'essence', 'Japanese', 'culture.5', 'Much', 'film', 'filmed', 'Hollywood', 'sets', 'backdrops', 'not', 'location', 'Japan.6', 'only', 'positive', 'attribute', 'can', 'give', 'movie', 'credit', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'As', 'well', 'how', 'trained', 'actresses', 'walk', 'high', 'flip', 'flops', ""'m"", 'still', 'baffled', 'how', 'pimps', '70', 'walked', 'high', 'platform', 'boots', 'goldfishes', '..just', 'joking.Finally', ""'d"", 'like', 'witness', 'film', 'pre', 'post', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Japan', 'American', 'director', 'distant', 'knowledge', 'regard', 'Rising', 'Sun', 'culture', 'then', 'welcome', 'go', 'check', 'out', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha']",N/A

The small font, singled spaced text was far from appealing to my eye. My preference to soft cover books over hard also hindered me from reading it. Once I finally dove into it, I was swept away by a fascinating story.MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is brilliantly written with amazingly unique lines, and packed full of information, giving great attention to detail. The story is captivating, and intriguing, heartbreaking and heartwarming. It reads like a biography, though in actuality it's a wonderful fictional story packed full of non-fiction material. This book will draw you into the world of a Geisha, equally sad and fascinating.Nine-year-old Chiyo and her sister were sold into slavery by their father while their mother was on her death bed. Thrown into the harsh world of the unknown, Chiyo soon realizes her only hope is to become a Geisha.MEMORIES OF A GEISHA takes the reader on Chiyo's journey from a young sister and daughter, to the aches, pains, and relentless training required to become a Geisha. Each and every character is so well thought-out you'll believe them to be real.Because the author was so detailed, I longed to see it visibly, and was tempted more than once to view the movie before I finished book. Within hours of completing the book, I watched the movie. It was extremely fast paced compared to the book, and like most great books, the movie couldn't compare, although I enjoyed it.It was great to see the book come alive, but I would highly recommend reading the book before the movie. Though you get the visual details in the movie, many of them have little meaning without the knowledge of the details behind them.

It wasn't too little or too much...just right.  I thought that Rob Marshall did a great job directing this film.  There are beautiful scenic shots throughout the film.

Immediately, after their mother died, Chiyo and Satsu were sold by their father to become geishas.  Upon arrival into town, the sisters were split apart.There comes a time when Chiyo is just at her saddest moment because she has lost a chance to reunite and escape with her sister and has been made a house slave.  However, by happenstance, Chiyo meets The Chairman who gives her hope and some friendly advice.  At that moment, Chiyo has fallen for The Chairman.

However, there's no best part because all of the pieces were wonderful!

169108,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1404983082,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 10]","Three movies won three Oscars this year and one of those three was ""Memoirs of a Geisha.""  These were for the Art Direction by art director John Myrhe and set decorator Gretchen Rau, Dion Beebe's Cinematography, and Colleen Atwood's Costume Design.  Those particular awards should be sufficient to tell you that this is a gorgeous looking film, but once you see it you may well come to the conclusion that the style of the film is its most substantive part.  There is great beauty here, to be sure, but not the soul that would make it a great film.I have not read Arthur Golden's best-selling novel, but I am aware that those who have are not simply complaining that the book is better (a constant complaint applicable to almost all literature adapted to the screen), but saying that the script by Robin Swicord (""Practical Magic"") has changed the novel into something inferior.  Obviously, I cannot speak to that, but I can comment on why this 2005 film proves to be less than satisfactory taken on its own terms.Young Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) and her sister are taken from their farming village and sold to a geisha house run by Mother (Kaori Momoi).  Chiyo ends up a possible candidate for becoming a geisha, although she has not idea what that means, while her sister, Satsu (Samantha Futerman) is immediately forced to work as a prostitute.  The geisha of the house, Hatsuomo (Li Gong), takes exception to the young girl and threatens to crush her.  But when she grows up, Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang), begins her training in earnest and is given the geisha name Sayuri, and is taken under the wing of the great geisha Mameha (Michelle Yeoh).The idea of training a geisha and the life they lived in Japan before World War II is a fascinating idea, but except for a stunning dance in artificial snow that is the highlight of the film, the training and the life ends up taking a back seat to a romantic plotline in the film.  As a young girl Chiyo first met the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), and her desire to become a geisha is entirely predicated on her belief that becoming one will bring her closer to the man she loves from afar.  Of course, the idea of love is antithetical to the ideals of the geisha, and a clear indication to my mind that Western sensibilities are going into play here.  The more Sayuri relies on her heart, the less I am attracted to the tale.  It is the denial of love that gives the geisha her pathos, and the example of Hatsuomo early on when she secretly meets with her love makes such indulgences to see quite tawdry.The Japanese sensibilities matter here because from our Western perspective this is the story of a woman who is sold into slavery to be a high priced courtesan.  Such a life is by definition better than dying on the street, but it is not a noble profession, and a woman who cannot give her heart is not allowed to be human.  The fact that geishas are not prostitutes is apparently not germane to the story.  True, after World War II many Japanese prostitutes presented themselves as Geishas and solidified that idea in the popular mind of Westerners, but a key selling point of ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is that it immerses us into a foreign culture and failing to do so accurately is going to be a major mark against the effort for those who recognize the difference.  This is a movie that will disappoint you because you have a sense for how fine it could have been if it were telling a more ambitious tale.I would have liked this movie better if it ended a scene earlier, preferring the somewhat tragic ending of the sick joke that is played on Sayuri to the deus ex machina happy ending, which only serves to conform that this is much more a melodrama than any sort of epic.  The fact that the principle women are played by Chinese actresses rather than Japanese has more to do with the recognition of this particular trio of women from ""Raise the Red Lantern"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" than from their ethnicity.  It is undoubtedly too soon to say that Chinese and Japanese actresses can now be exchanged with the same ease that American and English actresses cross the Pond to find work.  Still, it is a beautiful movie and the DVD extras make watching it and gaining some small insights into the world it portrays worth the effort and justify rounding up.",4,A beautiful film that loses it soul by Westernizing the tale too much,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,4302,"['Three', 'movies', 'won', 'three', 'Oscars', 'year', 'one', 'three', 'was', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'were', 'Art', 'Direction', 'art', 'director', 'John', 'Myrhe', 'set', 'decorator', 'Gretchen', 'Rau', 'Dion', 'Beebe', 'Cinematography', 'Colleen', 'Atwood', 'Costume', 'Design', 'particular', 'awards', 'should', 'be', 'sufficient', 'tell', 'gorgeous', 'looking', 'film', 'once', 'see', 'may', 'well', 'come', 'conclusion', 'style', 'film', 'most', 'substantive', 'part', 'great', 'beauty', 'here', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'soul', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'film.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'Arthur', 'Golden', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'am', 'aware', 'who', 'have', 'are', 'not', 'simply', 'complaining', 'book', 'better', 'constant', 'complaint', 'applicable', 'almost', 'literature', 'adapted', 'screen', 'saying', 'script', 'Robin', 'Swicord', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'changed', 'novel', 'something', 'inferior', 'Obviously', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'can', 'comment', 'why', '2005', 'film', 'proves', 'be', 'less', 'satisfactory', 'taken', 'own', 'terms.Young', 'Chiyo', 'Suzuka', 'Ohgo', 'sister', 'are', 'taken', 'farming', 'village', 'sold', 'geisha', 'house', 'run', 'Mother', 'Kaori', 'Momoi', 'Chiyo', 'up', 'possible', 'candidate', 'becoming', 'geisha', 'not', 'idea', 'what', 'sister', 'Satsu', 'Samantha', 'Futerman', 'immediately', 'forced', 'work', 'prostitute', 'geisha', 'house', 'Hatsuomo', 'Li', 'Gong', 'exception', 'young', 'girl', 'crush', 'when', 'up', 'Chiyo', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'training', 'earnest', 'given', 'geisha', 'name', 'Sayuri', 'taken', 'wing', 'great', 'geisha', 'Mameha', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', '.The', 'idea', 'training', 'geisha', 'life', 'lived', 'Japan', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'stunning', 'dance', 'artificial', 'snow', 'highlight', 'film', 'training', 'life', 'up', 'taking', 'back', 'seat', 'romantic', 'plotline', 'film', 'young', 'girl', 'Chiyo', 'first', 'met', 'Chairman', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'desire', 'become', 'geisha', 'entirely', 'predicated', 'belief', 'becoming', 'one', 'will', 'bring', 'closer', 'man', 'afar', 'course', 'idea', 'love', 'antithetical', 'ideals', 'geisha', 'clear', 'indication', 'mind', 'Western', 'sensibilities', 'are', 'going', 'play', 'here', 'more', 'Sayuri', 'relies', 'heart', 'less', 'am', 'attracted', 'tale', 'denial', 'love', 'geisha', 'pathos', 'example', 'Hatsuomo', 'early', 'when', 'secretly', 'love', 'such', 'indulgences', 'see', 'quite', 'tawdry.The', 'Japanese', 'sensibilities', 'matter', 'here', 'Western', 'perspective', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'sold', 'slavery', 'be', 'high', 'priced', 'courtesan', 'life', 'definition', 'better', 'dying', 'street', 'not', 'noble', 'profession', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'heart', 'not', 'allowed', 'be', 'human', 'fact', 'geishas', 'are', 'not', 'prostitutes', 'apparently', 'not', 'germane', 'story', 'True', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'many', 'Japanese', 'prostitutes', 'presented', 'Geishas', 'solidified', 'idea', 'popular', 'mind', 'Westerners', 'key', 'selling', 'point', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'foreign', 'culture', 'failing', 'do', 'so', 'accurately', 'going', 'be', 'major', 'mark', 'effort', 'who', 'recognize', 'difference', 'movie', 'will', 'disappoint', 'have', 'sense', 'how', 'fine', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'were', 'telling', 'more', 'ambitious', 'tale.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'better', 'ended', 'scene', 'earlier', 'preferring', 'somewhat', 'tragic', 'ending', 'sick', 'joke', 'played', 'Sayuri', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'happy', 'ending', 'only', 'conform', 'much', 'more', 'melodrama', 'sort', 'epic', 'fact', 'principle', 'women', 'are', 'played', 'Chinese', 'actresses', 'rather', 'Japanese', 'more', 'do', 'recognition', 'particular', 'trio', 'women', 'Raise', 'Red', 'Lantern', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'ethnicity', 'undoubtedly', 'too', 'soon', 'say', 'Chinese', 'Japanese', 'actresses', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'exchanged', 'same', 'ease', 'American', 'English', 'cross', 'Pond', 'find', 'work', 'Still', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'make', 'watching', 'gaining', 'small', 'insights', 'world', 'effort', 'justify', 'rounding', 'up']",N/A

169110,A3VLAZEPO9UJEA,1404983082,L. E. Cantrell,"[6, 19]","I have taken some time to skim over the hundred prior reviews for this film currently to be found on Amazon.  This is usually a worthwhile exercise, and so I found it to be here.  I particularly commend the perceptive ""Berk,"" who wrote the very first review.As might be expected, there is considerable variety of opinion, but there at least seems to be widely-held consensus that the film is visually stunning.  Although the casting of Chinese actresses in leading parts was controversial, it did not appear to do serious damage to the film in the minds of most reviewers.  Readers of the book seem to have been split down the middle as to whether the screenplay was adequately faithful to the printed version or disastrously untrue to it.  Some reviewers regarded ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" as a fairy tale, in particular a Cinderella story.It struck me as odd that reviewers did not make much of what was clearly the key scene of the whole movie, and clearly identified as such by the producers, since they highlighted it in virtually all their trailers and advertisements.  That, of course is the scene in which the newly adult heroine is informed that a true geisha needs only a single glance to make a man stop in his tracks.  The challenge being issued, the young woman immediately lavishes just such a glance on a poor shnook who happens to be riding by on a bicycle.  He is so stunned that he helplessly crashes into the first obstacle that presents itself--thus confirming the power of the geisha (and, alas, the general fate of all us poor shnooks.)A month ago, I underwent surgery for a hip replacement.  On the second day after the operation, being bed-ridden but wide-awake, I watched late night television.  The feature film on one of the national cable channels was ""Show Girls,"" a movie I had often heard derided but had never seen.  Last night, my wife decided that the way to celebrate my emergence from medical care and rehab was to see ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" (which she had been longing to see for months.)  After a meal at a conveniently located Japanese restaurant, we ambled over to the downtown theater at which ""Memoirs"" is still in first-run.  About twenty minutes in, it struck me that I had already seen this tale of senseless rivalry between supposedly glamorous female entertainers at the upper end of the sex trade.  ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is, at bottom, a remake of ""Show Girls""--and not a very good one.""Show Girls,"" as awful as it was, had a kind of loopy integrity.  It was faithful to its crackpot ideals.  The actresses (for want of a better term) were convincing in their loyalty to hard-bodied, clothing-optional shallowness.  They were honorably sleazy.  Their actions didn't make much sense, but they were the actions of people who actually do not make much sense in the real world.  ""Memoirs"" has none of that.In ""Show Girls,"" the hostility of the established performer for the newcomer has some cockeyed justification.  In ""Memoirs,"" it is a pointless malignancy that even Iago might question.In ""Show Girls,"" the rival women have a physicality and sensuality (sleazy, of course, and more power to them for it!) that cannot be denied.  They certainly hold the eye, if not the mind.  In ""Memoirs,"" there is nothing of the sort.  Oh, I can accept that sensuality in one culture does not necessarily translate into another--but this is an American film, based on an American book, guided by an American director on a set built in America.  There should be something for the American (and Canadian) audience.Consider that key scene.  The girl flashed THE LOOK and I felt ... nothing.  Audrey Hepburn could twinkle and whole battalions of men might figuratively clutch at their hearts and fall to their knees.  But from these actresses, and indeed the whole of ""Memoirs,"" there came nothing, nothing at all.  That poor shnook must just have been a lousy bicycle rider.  The whole film was utterly lacking in sensuality, whether good or bad, even in those wholly gratuitous near-rape scenes.As for the visual beauty of the film, I must disagree.  Far too many scenes were murkily underlit and claustrophobic.  With a very few exceptions, exterior scenes were preposterously over-cluttered.  It may well be that this was a faithful reproduction of the reality in Japan in those days but, for Pete's sake, this was a fairy tale, a Cinderella story.  It should have looked like one.  Japan's Floating World was exquisitely captured in countless prints by the artists of the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries.  The truth of those images is far greater than mere dreary reality.  In the prints, the Floating World is an endlessly attractive and seductive otherworld, not the crowded, decaying wasteland shown in the film.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is just another leaden, unconvincing, one-star Hollywood remake.  Do yourself a favor, rent the original, ""Show Girls,"" and savor true Tinseltown integrity.",1,Not nearly as good as the original,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,4936,"['have', 'taken', 'time', 'skim',

When I heard it was being made into a movie, I was dubious because I doubted that the feelings that the book created could ever be reproduced.  I hoped I was wrong.I was right.  The movie seems to miss the point.  It's true that it is beautiful.  The costumes and the scenery really do feel authentic even though I know the film was shot in California.  But the three main leads are not Japanese. They are Chinese.  And the personalities of the geishas seem to be more modern American than traditional Japanese.  When I first saw the trailer in the theater, and I saw the lead actress, Ziyi Zhang, who is indeed very beautiful, I couldn't help but notice her blue eyes.  Yes, blue eyes.  Immediately I knew that this film would lack authenticity.The acting is good on all counts however.  The production and cinematography are good too.  It's the screenplay and the casting that makes me raise an eyebrow.  What were they thinking?  Why are the characters either all bad or all good?  Where are the subtleties?  The film is 2 hours and 25 minutes long.  Usually, that's way too long for me.  Not this time though.  I wasn't bored.  I was interested.  I wanted more.  I wanted to come away with the feeling of what it is really like to be a geisha.  That didn't happen.In spite of all of this I do recommend the film.  Especially for those who will never read the book.  It is a quick glimpse into a very special world.  The fact that is lacking does not mean that it should be ignored.  Enjoy the film for what it is.",4,"Nice glimpse into a Geisha's world, but the casting doesn't work and the screenplay lacks subtlety",1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,1742,"['read', 'book', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'remember', 'was', 'lush', 'nuances', 'geisha', 'life', 'felt', 'real', 'emotion', 'geishas', 'world', 'portrayed', 'Japan', 'Japanese', 'people', 'core', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'dubious', 'doubted', 'feelings', 'book', 'created', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'reproduced', 'hoped', 'was', 'wrong.I', 'was', 'right', 'movie', 'miss', 'point', 'true', 'beautiful', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'really', 'do', 'feel', 'authentic', 'even', 'know', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'California', 'three', 'main', 'leads', 'are', 'not', 'Japanese', 'are', 'Chinese', 'personalities', 'geishas', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'modern', 'American', 'traditional', 'Japanese', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'theater', 'saw', 'lead', 'actress', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'who', 'indeed', 'very', 'beautiful', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Yes', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Immediately', 'knew', 'film', 'would', 'lack', 'authenticity.The', 'acting', 'good', 'counts', 'however', 'production', 'cinematography', 'are', 'good', 'too', 'screenplay', 'casting', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'What', 'were', 'thinking', 'Why', 'are', 'characters', 'bad', 'good', 'Where', 'are', 'subtleties', 'film', '2', 'hours', '25', 'minutes', 'long', 'Usually', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'Not', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'bored', 'was', 'interested', 'wanted', 'more', 'wanted', 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'be', 'geisha', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen.In', 'spite', 'do', 'recommend', 'film', 'Especially', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'quick', 'glimpse', 'very', 'special', 'world', 'fact', 'lacking', 'not', 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'ignored', 'Enjoy', 'film', 'what']",N/A

The movie is close to 2 1/2 hours long, but the story and scenery are so captivating, it seems so much quicker.  The costumes are fantastic and it's no wonder they are nominated for Oscars.It tells the story of a little girl called Chiyo who along with her older sister, is sold by their father who has no money.  The people who bought her, want to make her a geisha so she goes off to school but brings disgrace to herself and therefore they make her their slave.  Upon chance, she meets a kind man who buys her a sweet cherry ice cone.  She never forgets him and sees him again by chance some years later.  Now she has hope and learns again (in a crash course) how to be a geisha and her new name is Sayuri.The story that unfolds from there has ups and downs but the ending is so moving that of course I cried my head off.  The setting is beautiful and it made me want to go and visit Japan.  The music too is lovely and I hope they do get some Oscars next week because it's a very deserving movie.  There is also a great performance by an actress called Li Gong who plays 'Queen Bitch' Hatsumomo and look for a small role played by Ted Levine who we normally see in a funny role as Captain Leland Stottlemeyer in Monk.Beautiful move that you absolutely have to see.

Much of the time, they may say those things because they've never read the book.  However, book-to-movie adaptations are meant to enhance the experience by bringing the book to life.  So in the case where the viewer says they don't understand, I feel that they should take part of the blame for not researching the culture before watching the movie.  It's a good thing to come out of our cultural shells once and a while.Second, I thought this movie was a decent book-to-movie adaptation.  Of course, the argument is the book is always better than the movie, to see something tranlated into something so lush and exotic, the Memoirs of a Geisha movie is definitly a truthful eye-candy interpretation of the book. So luch and exotic, this attribute that kept me flipping through the pages also held my wonder throughout the film.Great acting on the part of a few.  Sayuri's chemistry with Nobu is undeniable.  Mameha holds true to her mentor-like qualities yet hold fasts to her insecurities.  Hatsumomo may seem a bit deranged to members of the audience but her desire to feel loved rather than prized is portrayed more through the film than this book.  Although I would advise her to take some hormones, she was somewhat close to a madwoman in this movie.Above all, a great movie.  Maybe not Oscar worthy but something to add to my DVD collection.

But there are several things pretty awful about this movie. First is the dialogue and the script. They sound pretty fake, un-Japanese and almost stereotypically racist as if it was written by someone who expect oriental people to talk in such a wooden way. It also don't help that none of the lead Asian actresses of the film outside of Michelle Yeoh can't speak English so the movie sounds like it been dubbed and badly. It also don't helped that in those scenes where the Americans were involved, how does these sheltered geisha ladies learned to speak English so well or were these Americans actually speaking Japanese?? Does anyone care or did they just gave up hope? Whats also sad is that even although these females are supposed to be Japanese, they can't even speak the language right. I had a hard time picking up certain words they were stressing on throughout the movie because they were so badly worded.The book must be ten million times better since this stripped down version of the movie barely covered the characters all that well. That is because none of the characters seem to very believable since they all seem to be stereotypical types. You got your good and kind geisha like Sayuri (the heroine), the bad and snake like geisha like Hastumomo, kind mentor like Momeha and so on.The movie seem to take a lot of short cuts. Even Sayuri's training seem to be so short that it was unbelievable that she can be such a great geisha after such a short time.

As far as the casting, if John Wayne can play Genghis Khan (yeah, he did), and Tom Cruise can go down as the Last Samurai... heck, why not?  Actually after some thought I can see the furor over Chinese actresses cast as geisha - a geisha is not just any woman, she is the quintissential, perfect Japanese woman... if you think about it, that really is thoughtless casting, but I'm not of either heritage so I shouldn't overstate my opinion as far as that goes.  For the most part the quality of the acting outweighs the nationalities of the actors - Zhang really carries the film, Gong Li is as always excellent and shows so much subtle, unspoken fire and intelligence, she is such a great actress. And the girl who played young Chiyo is wonderful and such a cute kid. To me only the casting of Michelle Yeoh got in the way - she does a decent job but wow, she is SO non-Japanese, there are a few times it really did get in the way for me. The film is photographed beautifully and action is well-paced, the political scheming and infighting among the female leads is a lot of fun to watch as it escalates to its inevitable end.  The final act involving the post-WWII Americans and their ""contract"" is contrived and implausible, but overall, considering this was made from a very involved and multi-layered novel (from what i know, i did not read it), i think the filmmakers did an admirable job of telling a great story.",4,Japanese Cinderella,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,1467,"['very', 'well-made', 'film', 'great', 'performances', 'As', 'far', 'casting', 'John', 'Wayne', 'can', 'play', 'Genghis', 'Khan', 'yeah', 'did', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'can', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'heck', 'why', 'not', 'Actually', 'thought', 'can', 'see', 'furor', 'Chinese', 'actresses', 'cast', 'geisha', 'geisha', 'not', 'just', 'woman', 'quintissential', 'perfect', 'Japanese', 'woman', 'think', 'really', 'thoughtless', 'casting', ""'m"", 'not', 'heritage', 'so', 'should', ""n't"", 'overstate', 'opinion', 'as', 'far', 'most', 'part', 'quality', 'acting', 'outweighs', 'nationalities', 'actors', 'Zhang', 'really', 'film', 'Gong', 'Li', 'always', 'excellent', 'so', 'much', 'subtle', 'unspoken', 'fire', 'intelligence', 'such', 'great', 'actress', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Chiyo', 'wonderful', 'such', 'cute', 'kid', 'only', 'casting', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'got', 'way', 'decent', 'job', 'wow', 'SO', 'non-Japanese', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'way', 'film', 'photographed', 'beautifully', 'action', 'well-paced', 'political', 'scheming', 'infighting', 'female', 'leads', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'inevitable', 'end', 'final', 'act', 'involving', 'post-WWII', 'Americans', 'contract', 'contrived', 'implausible', 'overall', 'considering', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'involved', 'multi-layered', 'novel', 'what', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'i', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'admirable', 'job', 'telling', 'great', 'story']",N/A

169131,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,1404983082,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 6]","So getting this on DVD was an absolute necessity, since I didn't get a chance to see it at the cinema. It's just a sudden thing that I like the whole Geisha look, but what originally caught my eye, and made me buy the book & the DVD was the poster. I want that poster! I also have black hair, although I doubt I could go through the whole fuss of the kimono!!! But the thing that is said, that you can stop a guy in his tracks with just one look - that would be good.This film really made the book come to life in front of my eyes, unlike what other reviewers have said. I loved all the actresses, and although I always imagined the Chairman to be older, the actor who played him was amazing.The whole film transported the viewer to a totally different world, evoking the time period, as the film was based from the 1930s to the 50s. Every little attention to detail was well done, and everything just worked for me.All the actresses did so well in their roles, if you watch the extras, they're literally put through hell to become geisha in the film. Did you see the shoes they had to walk in?! Ouch. They were put through a six week crash course on everything geisha. They managed, even the young girls who played the young Chiyo Chan & Pumpkin in the film.Some things were slightly different from the book to the film, which is obvious. Having the doctor deal with the cut on her leg had a lot more significance in the book, as it led up to the bidding war for her ""mizuage"" (virginity). Also the fact that her sister became a child prostitute was kinda glossed over in the book, but made more obvious in the film I thought. But Hatsumomo (played by Li Gong) came across even more nasty than in the book, and her eyes are so evil! Michelle Yeoh as the older geisha, and Ziyi Zhang, as Sayuri, had eyes that could convey the smallest emotion, as geisha were meant to do, as they weren't really meant to show emotion.The plot sticks very closely to the book, with unnecessary scenes eliminated, but never in any way did it come across as being speeded up, or take any shortcuts. There were no sacrifices made in terms of the story.I think it would have made things easier if the whole film was in Japanese. It's almost entirely in English, and there are some differing accents thrown in there. But I don't think it would have been such a big hit if it had been in Japanese, and subtitled, as some people are severely opposed to 'reading' during films. Michelle Yeoh's English is very polished but Li Gong & Ziyi Zhang's English is spoken hesitantly, as they're not really sure what they're saying.The film (and the book) seem to hit a brick wall when they have to deal with World War II, and both changed for me here, I'm glad to see other reviewers agree with me. It just seemed to go downhill for a period, although comes back up at the end, for a nice happy ending. It's intended to show that no one is safe, even geisha, when a war comes around, and a couple of characters do an about face. Pumpkin suddenly becomes an American friendly prostitute and seems to belong in another movie altogether.The extras, unlike most films, are actually very informative, although I would have liked to have seen more of the makeup side of things - I absolutely love how they did the eyeliner - but still, the film actually makes you want to watch the extras. They're not your usual fluff.I think that Memoirs Of A Geisha will be even better on repeat viewings, and it's definitely one of my favourite movies. Sure, it's 30 minutes too long, but it's a movie that has to be seen.",4,I love the whole Geisha look,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,3570,"['So', 'getting', 'DVD', 'was', 'absolute', 'necessity', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'cinema', 'just', 'sudden', 'thing', 'like', 'whole', 'Geisha', 'look', 'what', 'originally', 'caught', 'eye', 'made', 'buy', 'book', 'DVD', 'was', 'poster', 'want', 'poster', 'also', 'have', 'black', 'hair', 'doubt', 'could', 'go', 'whole', 'fuss', 'kimono', 'thing', 'said', 'can', 'stop', 'guy', 'tracks', 'just', 'one', 'look', 'would', 'be', 'good.This', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'front', 'eyes', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'loved', 'actresses', 'always', 'imagined', 'Chairman', 'be', 'older', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'was', 'amazing.The', 'whole', 'film', 'transported', 'viewer', 'totally', 'different', 'world', 'evoking', 'time', 'period', 'film', 'was', 'based', '1930s', '50s', 'little', 'attention', 'detail', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'everything', 'just', 'worked', 'actresses', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'roles', 'watch', 'extras', ""'re"", 'literally', 'put', 'hell', 'become', 'geisha', 'film', 'Did', 'see', 'shoes', 'had', 'walk', 'Ouch', 'were', 'put', 'six', 'week', 'crash', 'course', 'everything', 'geisha', 'managed', 'even', 'young', 'girls', 'who', 'played', 'young', 'Chiyo', 'Chan', 'Pumpkin', 'film.Some', 'things', 'were', 'slightly', 'different', 'book', 'film', 'obvious', 'Having', 'doctor', 'deal', 'cut', 'leg', 'had', 'lot', 'more', 'significance', 'book', 'led', 'up', 'bidding', 'war', 'mizuage', 'virginity', 'Also', 'fact', 'sister', 'became', 'child', 'prostitute', 'was', 'kinda', 'glossed', 'book', 'made', 'more', 'obvious', 'film', 'thought', 'Hatsumomo', 'played', 'Li', 'Gong', 'came', 'even', 'more', 'nasty', 'book', 'eyes', 'are', 'so', 'evil', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'older', 'geisha', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'Sayuri', 'had', 'eyes', 'could', 'convey', 'smallest', 'emotion', 'geisha', 'were', 'meant', 'do', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'show', 'emotion.The', 'plot', 'sticks', 'very', 'closely', 'book', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'eliminated', 'never', 'way', 'did', 'come', 'being', 'speeded', 'up', 'take', 'shortcuts', 'were', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'terms', 'story.I', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'things', 'easier', 'whole', 'film', 'was', 'Japanese', 'almost', 'entirely', 'English', 'are', 'differing', 'accents', 'thrown', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'big', 'hit', 'had', 'been', 'Japanese', 'subtitled', 'people', 'are', 'severely', 'opposed', ""'reading"", 'films', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'English', 'very', 'polished', 'Li', 'Gong', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'English', 'spoken', 'hesitantly', ""'re"", 'not', 'really', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'saying.The', 'film', 'book', 'seem', 'hit', 'brick', 'wall', 'when', 'have', 'deal', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'changed', 'here', ""'m"", 'glad', 'see', 'other', 'reviewers', 'agree', 'just', 'seemed', 'go', 'downhill', 'period', 'back', 'up', 'end', 'nice', 'happy', 'ending', 'intended', 'show', 'one', 'safe', 'even', 'geisha', 'when', 'war', 'around', 'couple', 'characters', 'do', 'face', 'Pumpkin', 'suddenly', 'American', 'friendly', 'prostitute', 'belong', 'movie', 'altogether.The', 'extras', 'most', 'films', 'are', 'actually', 'very', 'informative', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'makeup', 'side', 'things', 'absolutely', 'love', 'how', 'did', 'eyeliner', 'still', 'film', 'actually', 'want', 'watch', 'extras', ""'re"", 'not', 'usual', 'fluff.I', 'think', 'Memoirs', 'A', 'Geisha', 'will', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'repeat', 'viewings', 'definitely', 'one', 'favourite', 'movies', 'Sure', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

169134,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,1404983082,Melissa Niksic,"[13, 16]","Rob Marshall did an excellent job bringing Arthur Golden's novel to life on the big screen. ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" transports moviegoers to 1920s Japan, where a young girl named Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang) is sold to an okiya and overcomes numerous struggles to become one of the most prestigious geishas in all of Gion. With the help of Mameha, a successful geisha with a hidden agenda (Michelle Yeoh), the beautiful servant girl with striking blue-gray eyes transforms into the elegant Sayuri. The film is also a love story of sorts: Chiyo's chance meeting with the Chairman (Ken Watanbe) when she is a young girl is an event that shapes her destiny. However, as Mameha says in the film, women become geishas because they have no choice, and they are forced to make massive sacrifices because of it.The casting for this movie is spectacular. Critics have bashed this film because most of the main characters are played by Chinese actors, but they do an amazing job. (Plus, they're ACTORS! You don't have to actually BE a geisha in order to PLAY a geisha in a movie. Similarly, you do not have to BE Japanese in order to successfully PORTRAY a Japanese person in a film. People who have knocked this movie solely because of the cultural background of the actors are out of their minds.) I will be shocked if Zhang doesn't receive an Oscar nomination for her moving portrayal as Chiyo/Sayuri. Yeoh is perfect as the cool and collected Mameha, and Li Gong delivers an excellent performance as the beautiful and sadistic Hatsumomo.Visually, this movie is perfect. I've read Golden's novel and every aspect of the film looks exactly the way I pictured it when I was reading the book. As is the case with every book-to-movie adaptation, some material from the book always has to be cut. There were also a few things that differed from the book for no apparent reason. I thought some of the characters were toned down a bit for the film: Nobu wasn't as physically repulsive as he should have been and some of Hatsumomo's most vicious moments from the book aren't included in the movie, which is a shame. I also felt that the film didn't do a good enough job of thoroughly explaining the nature of the relationship between a geisha and her ""danna."" People who haven't read the book might be a bit confused by that whole thing. Finally, the ending of the movie was way too abrupt. The final pages of Golden's novel do a good job of explaining how Sayuri's relationship with the Chairman evolves over time. Remember, this is a man who is married and already has a family of his own: it's not like he and his geisha just walked off into the sunset and lived happily ever after together, which is the way the film made it out to be. There was a lot more to it than that, and I don't see why it wasn't presented more clearly in the movie.I think ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is a good film adaptation of an excellent novel. My advice is that you read the book BEFORE seeing the movie: you'll enjoy the film more if you walk into the theatre with a sense of what's going on.",4,"Visually stunning, slightly lacking in content",1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,3045,"['Rob', 'Marshall', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'Arthur', 'Golden', 'novel', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'moviegoers', '1920s', 'Japan', 'where', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Chiyo', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'sold', 'okiya', 'overcomes', 'numerous', 'struggles', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'prestigious', 'geishas', 'Gion', 'help', 'Mameha', 'successful', 'geisha', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'beautiful', 'servant', 'girl', 'striking', 'blue-gray', 'eyes', 'transforms', 'elegant', 'Sayuri', 'film', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'sorts', 'Chiyo', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Chairman', 'Ken', 'Watanbe', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'event', 'destiny', 'However', 'Mameha', 'film', 'women', 'become', 'geishas', 'have', 'choice', 'are', 'forced', 'make', 'massive', 'sacrifices', 'it.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'Critics', 'have', 'bashed', 'film', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Chinese', 'actors', 'do', 'amazing', 'job', ""'re"", 'ACTORS', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'actually', 'BE', 'geisha', 'order', 'PLAY', 'geisha', 'movie', 'Similarly', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'BE', 'Japanese', 'order', 'successfully', 'PORTRAY', 'Japanese', 'person', 'film', 'People', 'who', 'have', 'knocked', 'movie', 'solely', 'cultural', 'background', 'actors', 'are', 'minds', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'Zhang', ""n't"", 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'moving', 'portrayal', 'Chiyo/Sayuri', 'Yeoh', 'perfect', 'cool', 'collected', 'Mameha', 'Li', 'Gong', 'excellent', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'sadistic', 'Hatsumomo.Visually', 'movie', 'perfect', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Golden', 'novel', 'aspect', 'film', 'exactly', 'way', 'pictured', 'when', 'was', 'reading', 'book', 'case', 'book-to-movie', 'adaptation', 'material', 'book', 'always', 'be', 'cut', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'things', 'differed', 'book', 'apparent', 'reason', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'toned', 'down', 'bit', 'film', 'Nobu', 'was', ""n't"", 'physically', 'repulsive', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Hatsumomo', 'most', 'vicious', 'moments', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'movie', 'shame', 'also', 'felt', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'thoroughly', 'explaining', 'nature', 'relationship', 'geisha', 'danna', 'People', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'confused', 'whole', 'thing', 'Finally', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'abrupt', 'final', 'pages', 'Golden', 'novel', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'explaining', 'how', 'Sayuri', 'relationship', 'Chairman', 'time', 'Remember', 'man', 'who', 'married', 'already', 'family', 'own', 'not', 'geisha', 'just', 'walked', 'off', 'sunset', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'together', 'way', 'film', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'presented', 'more', 'clearly', 'movie.I', 'think', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'good', 'film', 'adaptation', 'excellent', 'novel', 'advice', 'read', 'book', 'seeing', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'more', 'walk', 'theatre', 'sense', 'what', 'going']",N/A

That being said and just as he did in ""Chicago"", Marshall can turn the magic jets on full force particularly in the dance sequence in which Sayuri makes her reputation as the foremost Geisha in Osaka: in front of an audience of her peers (Gong Li as a demonically possessed Hatsumomo), her mentor (Michelle Yeoh as Mameha) and her true, unrequited love (""The Last Samurai's"" Ken Watanabe), Sayuri performs a thrilling, beautifully choreographed and staged dance high on drama and sensuality. If only the entire film were on this other-worldly and elegant level.The production design and costumes are, though: ""Memoirs"" is eye-poppingly beautiful to behold. Every detail of the Osaka landscape is amazingly perfect particularly since this film was primarily shot on a US studio lot in Southern California. Amazing.There has been much talk about non-Japanese playing these roles and the fact that all the actors speak the Englsh dialogue in, due to their various places of birth, ambi-asian-tinged accents but I found nothing amiss here in either case: all of the actors, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malaysian perform admirably and several even more than that.Ziyi Zhang is a revelation. Her Sayuri is a flesh and blood creation yet also a dreamer: a girl and a woman with a dream and the talent to back it up: she succeeds through hard work and a desire to rise above her meager beginnings. Zhang, at least in the movies that have been released here (a prime exception would be the sublime ""2046""), has heretofore played warriors but in ""Memoirs"" she plays a multi-faceted woman with a deep well of unrequited love and unfulfilled sexuality and she is truly memorable.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" should have been better. As it is, it is too long and the 3rd act is problematic: dull scenes alternate with scenes of high drama.

The girl must endure beatings from her mistress and from the jealous other geishas in the house as well as losing her sister and parents.She fails as a geisha and is tricked by the other geisha's into damaging a kimono of her mistress and thus is made to be a slave to the mistress to pay off the damage.  When she reaches her lowest level of despair, she meets an upper-class gentleman who buys her a flavored ice and gives her a handkerchief and some money.  The girl treasures the handkerchief and donates the money for a prayer of a better life and one where she can be with her mysterious benefactor.  With her life turned to a more positive outlook she is noticed by another mistress, who wants to borrow her to train as a geisha.  Once a deal is struck the girl puts her heart into being the best geisha in all of Japan.  Now her last desire to be fulfilled is to win the heart of her benefactor, who she has never stopped thinking about.  The US occupation sends everything into disarray as she must hide in the countryside and give up her geisha life-style.The movie is beautifully shot and the acting is first-rate (most of the actors were in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and easily have made the transition away from action films to serious drama).  My only complaint was some of the actors had very heavy accents which were difficult to understand without putting on the subtitles.

By and large, though, I was very happy with the film version. It's a tragic love story of almost Shakespearean cast, running from Chiyo's father selling her into the geisha trade sometimes in the late 1920s through the final attainment of Sayuri's lifelong goal -- hooking up with the Chairman -- in the late 1940s under U.S. occupation. The cinematography is truly stunning -- Japan is visually fascinating no matter who takes the pictures -- and the costuming is gorgeous. Of course, most of the Gion district of Kyoto no longer exists, but the set construction was entirely convincing. The ethereal Ziyi Zhang is first-rate as the teenage and adult protagonist (even if she's actually Chinese) and Suzuka Ohgo is quite winning as the anguished child. Ken Watanabe has been a superstar in Japan for years, though not well enough known here. There are numerous other Japanese, Chinese, and Korean actors well known in Asia but not in the U.S., which makes this almost a repertory effort. (Even Mako, veteran of more than 130 movies and television series since the early 1960s, appears in a minor role.) Ted Levine, who plays the American colonel, had me baffled for a minute, before I realized he plays Capt. Stottlemeyer on the ""Monk"" TV series. Actually, my only (minor) complaint is that the early part of the film was a bit muddled because the actors' English pronunciation was shaky; if I hadn't known the plot already, I probably would have gotten quickly lost. Maybe they should have used subtitles in the early part of the film. After Ziyi Zhang took over the role, however, there were no problems. And finally, John Williams's score was beautiful, as almost always.",4,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous",1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1804,"['loved', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'movie', 'got', 'lot', 'equivocal', 'reviews', 'sat', 'trepidation', 'large', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'film', 'version', 'tragic', 'love', 'story', 'almost', 'Shakespearean', 'cast', 'running', 'Chiyo', 'father', 'selling', 'geisha', 'trade', 'sometimes', 'late', '1920s', 'final', 'attainment', 'Sayuri', 'lifelong', 'goal', 'hooking', 'up', 'Chairman', 'late', '1940s', 'U.S.', 'occupation', 'cinematography', 'truly', 'stunning', 'Japan', 'visually', 'fascinating', 'matter', 'who', 'pictures', 'costuming', 'gorgeous', 'course', 'most', 'Gion', 'district', 'Kyoto', 'no', 'longer', 'set', 'construction', 'was', 'entirely', 'convincing', 'ethereal', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'first-rate', 'teenage', 'adult', 'protagonist', 'even', 'actually', 'Chinese', 'Suzuka', 'Ohgo', 'quite', 'winning', 'anguished', 'child', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'been', 'superstar', 'Japan', 'years', 'not', 'well', 'enough', 'known', 'here', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'Japanese', 'Chinese', 'Korean', 'actors', 'well', 'known', 'Asia', 'not', 'U.S.', 'almost', 'repertory', 'effort', 'Even', 'Mako', 'veteran', 'more', '130', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'early', '1960s', 'minor', 'role', 'Ted', 'Levine', 'who', 'American', 'colonel', 'had', 'baffled', 'minute', 'realized', 'Capt', 'Stottlemeyer', 'Monk', 'TV', 'series', 'Actually', 'only', 'minor', 'complaint', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'muddled', 'actors', 'English', 'pronunciation', 'was', 'shaky', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'plot', 'already', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'quickly', 'lost', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'used', 'subtitles', 'early', 'part', 'film', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'took', 'over', 'role', 'however', 'were', 'problems', 'finally', 'John', 'Williams', 'score', 'was', 'beautiful', 'almost', 'always']",N/A

Miller,"[5, 11]","Memoirs of a Geisha, based on Arthur Golden's book by the same name, is basically a story about the forbidden emotions, in particular forbidden love, of the geisha.  For when a geisha becomes one it is rarely by want, as we see early on.  Why the main character, whose name changes, well a lot, is ripped from her home at the age of 9 to the life of only `potential geisha', if she can make it.  At this point you would think, as the movie seems to tell us, that being a geisha isn't easy.However, as someone who honestly got bored after 61 pages of the book, I have to say that the movie too was quite boring.  Especially since being a geisha, or at least learning about being one, seems just boring.  Yes, the rivalry between two `sister' geisha, is always there, but there is little doubt about who will win.  Then, there is the forbidden (for a geisha) and definitely pedophiliac love that the main geisha character ensues, but the audience is left with little surprise, and interest, there as well.All in all then, the movie does little to add to one's actual knowledge of geisha, (unless you never took a far east class somewhere along the line).  Moreover, this film is not that good of a period peace, since World War II, is almost left in the dust till the near end of the film.So ultimately, you may read the book perhaps, and maybe see the movie, but if you want to actually learn about the memoirs of geisha (yes I know this was fiction) then there are easier, and more entertaining ways to do so.",2,"About an hour too long, and a story just too uninteresting",1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,1509,"['Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'based', 'Arthur', 'Golden', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'basically', 'story', 'forbidden', 'emotions', 'particular', 'forbidden', 'love', 'geisha', 'when', 'geisha', 'one', 'rarely', 'want', 'see', 'early', 'Why', 'main', 'character', 'name', 'changes', 'well', 'lot', 'ripped', 'home', 'age', '9', 'life', 'only', 'potential', 'geisha', 'can', 'make', 'point', 'would', 'think', 'movie', 'tell', 'being', 'geisha', ""n't"", 'easy.However', 'someone', 'who', 'honestly', 'got', 'bored', '61', 'pages', 'book', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'too', 'was', 'quite', 'boring', 'Especially', 'being', 'geisha', 'least', 'learning', 'being', 'one', 'just', 'boring', 'Yes', 'rivalry', 'two', 'sister', 'geisha', 'always', 'there', 'little', 'doubt', 'who', 'will', 'win', 'Then', 'forbidden', 'geisha', 'definitely', 'pedophiliac', 'love', 'main', 'geisha', 'character', 'ensues', 'audience', 'left', 'little', 'surprise', 'interest', 'well.All', 'then', 'movie', 'little', 'add', 'one', 'actual', 'knowledge', 'geisha', 'never', 'took', 'far', 'east', 'class', 'somewhere', 'line', 'Moreover', 'film', 'not', 'good', 'period', 'peace', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'almost', 'left', 'dust', 'till', 'near', 'end', 'film.So', 'ultimately', 'may', 'read', 'book', 'perhaps', 'maybe', 'see', 'movie', 'want', 'actually', 'learn', 'memoirs', 'geisha', 'yes', 'know', 'was', 'fiction', 'then', 'are', 'easier', 'more', 'entertaining', 'ways', 'do', 'so']",N/A

I really can't stress enough that this is a very well made film.  The actors and actresses are very strong, as well.  However, the storyline, while interesting, never really draws you in.The film starts off strong, with scenes of two young girls being sold into slavery, with one being sold to a brothel and the other to a geisha house.  We see tough lifestyles and how the lead character, played very well by Zhang Ziyi, copes with her situation.  The problem with the story for me was that I never really saw what the hope was.  Are we supposed to root that she will be a geisha to someone she cares about although she can never marry them?  Also, the basis of the romance is a young girls fantasy coming from one chance encounter.  There are various scenes of conflict that are stressful, and moments of triumph that are wonderful, but in the end, where's the real hope?I personally felt that the film ends up a little empty because there was no real hope.  The hope of the lead character is not something that most of us would even consider positive.  In other films, even tragedies are tragedies because of some extinguished hope.  This film never has a real hope element to be extinguished.

That being said, I probably shouldn't have watched this directly after finishing the book.  It took a little away from the movie for me.Chiyo (Suzukha Ohgo) is a young girl who is sold, along with her sister, in Kyoto.  They are separated, and while her sister goes away, Chiyo is sold to an okiya (house for geishas) and is apprenticed as a Geisha there.  However, between trouble she brings on herself by trying to run away, and the jealousy of resident Geisha Hatsumomo (Gong Li), life doesn't go the way its supposed to for Chiyo.  Thinking herself destined to become a maid with no future, Chiyo gives up all hope until she is encountered by a handsome man on the bridge who buys her a flavored ice.  This man, the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), is what inspires her to do everything she can to become a Geisha.Years pass and Chiyo is finally given her chance when the famous Geisha Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) takes her under her wing and teaches her the art of the Geisha.  She debuts as Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi) and quickly earns her way to fame.  She faces some opposition from Hatsumomo and can never fully realize her dream of being with the Chairman as too many things get in the way.  She has her duty as a Geisha, then comes the War, and after the war she has to struggle to reearn her place in the world of Geisha.There are many other actors in this film of course but they play more minor roles compared to the ones already listed.  There is the vivacious Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) who is first a friend and later a rival.  Nobi (Koji Yakusho) a stern man with no love of Geisha except for Sayuri.  Mother (Kaori Momoi) who runs the okiya and is a stern mistress and many others.  Most of them were well played although after reading the book, it seemed that Sayuri wasn't given as much personality in this film.  Mameha was played excellently as was the Chairman.The film itself was beautiful and the music authentic.  These two were paired throughout the film to make the art of the geisha and its no surprise that books have been made with photos from the film.  Everything, the costuming, make-up, and scenes were exquisitely done.  It was truly a pleasure for the eyes to watch.While somewhat disappointed with the film after reading the book it was still a masterpiece to watch and because not all read the book I will rate the film on its merit as a film alone; which is five stars.

There, she works and slaves, always under the thumb of the hen of the household, Hatsumomo.  Then she blossoms and her beauty shows thru until she is met one day by the Chairman, a very rich, handsome, and eligible patron of geishas.  She is rescued from her servitude by a rival geisha house and is pruned to become Japan's next great geisha.  She accomplishes this, only to lose many things in turn, such as her old friends, her family, and most importantly, her sense of self-worth and self-respect.  Later, a world war upsets everything and things begin anew.  At the end, she encounters again the Chairman, and they finally reveal their hearts and histories to each other.  This movie is a potpourri of sadness, melancholy, drama, frustration, tragedy and only the occasionally happy moment.  The characters all have one of two flaws; either they are too innocent to keep away from evil, or too evil to leave the innocent alone.

I was pleased to see that the movie followed the book very closely. The film was absolutely beautiful, with arresting shots of the geisha as they went about their daily tasks and beautiful pans of the gorgeous faces of the actresses. There were also a few nice shots of (what was supposed to be) the Japanese countryside.The film follws Chiyo (Sayuri), a young girl from the country who grows to become one of the most celebrated geisha in pre-war Japan. I know that there was a big stink when the film came out that some of the actresses cast were Chinese, rather than Japanese, but I say phooey on that. You cast an actor to play a role. I've seen plenty of straight actors turn in wonderfully nuanced performances of gay characters. I've seen plenty of older actors play roles that were younger than they were, and vice versa. So what? The director's job is to find the right actor for the role, and that actor may or may not be the exact nationality referred to in the script. The point is, does this performer tell the story?And the performers in Memoirs of a Geisha definitely do. Ziyi Zhang (Chiyo/Sayuri), Li Gong (Hatsumomo), and Michelle Yeoh (Mameha) all give their characters a wonderful depth and subtext, and I really enjoyed them. I know that some critics also huffed about the movie being Westernized, with the actors all speaking English, etc. Wha . . . ? The movie is based on a book written by Arthur Golden, a middle-aged white guy from Tennessee. How can you get more Western than that?

Sayuri (Zhang Ziyi) admits that he loved him since she was a little girl and the Chairman admits the he likes her and remembers giving her a treat from the time before she was a geisha. that was it. the ending seemed too simple.

I mean, sure it appeals to a broader audience but it loses part of it's authenticity. And no, I'm not Japanese and I would have to read the subtitles too but I'm guessing it would've been so much better.That said, let's delve into the Japanese culture, or at least from my point of view. I have always perceived Japanese as an honorable nation, with discipline and moral values. They have always left an impression of hardworking and dilligent people as well. I have no qualms about the casting of Geisha, but I felt the story itself had so many shortcomings. I don't know if it was written this way by Arthur Holden, or somewhere in between adapting it to screenplay, things got sour. The concept of Geisha was intrigueing but as a whole, the story was disappointing only because it did not leave a huge impact on me. It was just OKAY.Thank goodness the acting made up for it's lacklustre screenplay. The who's who of Asian cinema is cast and it was a brilliant decision. Although the dialogue is mediocre and even corny at times (maybe because of their poor command in english), they are able to act out their feelings with unbelievable charisma and this took the whole movie to a higher emotional level. I have watched many of Zhang Ziyi's movies since her debut and she never fails to impress me. She was breath-taking in the movie and displays the perfect ammount of determination, grief, happiness to bring her character Sayuki to life. Being a Malaysian myself, Michelle Yeoh certainly does my home country proud by being her regal self, and commanding respect in every scene she's in. And as for Gong Li, she deserves at least an Oscar nomination for her role of Hatsumomo. You can see the effects of her tormented life, how she wants more than what she has. You feel angry but at the same time, your heart goes out to her. Wonderful performance! Ken Watanabe was a bit miscast as Chairman, probably because I've gotten used to his kick-a$$ roles in movies like The Last Samurai and Batman Begins that seeing him here channeling romance and poetry was a little too much for me.The cinematography was also brilliant, with so much color and music that it breathed some life to the movie. It was definitely an attack on your sensors (in a good way). The direction was alrite, nothing outstanding I would say but Rob Marshall does pull off quite a lot of ""money"" shots here especially his take of Japanese traditions like swirling kimonos, sumo wrestling, those wooden houses and the ""oh-so-amazing"" geisha dances.But in the end, what would've made this good movie truely great is a better screenplay, but that's life, we can't get everything we hoped for can we?",3,"The good, the bad and the ugly...",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,2791,"['watching', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'mixed', 'emotions', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'movie', 'filming', 'english', 'mean', 'sure', 'appeals', 'broader', 'audience', 'part', 'authenticity', ""'m"", 'not', 'Japanese', 'would', 'have', 'read', 'subtitles', 'too', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.That', 'said', 'let', 'delve', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'least', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'always', 'perceived', 'Japanese', 'honorable', 'nation', 'discipline', 'moral', 'values', 'have', 'always', 'left', 'impression', 'hardworking', 'dilligent', 'people', 'well', 'have', 'qualms', 'casting', 'Geisha', 'felt', 'story', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'shortcomings', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'written', 'way', 'Arthur', 'Holden', 'somewhere', 'adapting', 'screenplay', 'things', 'got', 'sour', 'concept', 'Geisha', 'was', 'intrigueing', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'disappointing', 'only', 'did', 'not', 'leave', 'huge', 'impact', 'was', 'just', 'OKAY.Thank', 'goodness', 'acting', 'made', 'up', 'lacklustre', 'screenplay', 'who', 'who', 'Asian', 'cinema', 'cast', 'was', 'brilliant', 'decision', 'dialogue', 'mediocre', 'even', 'corny', 'times', 'maybe', 'poor', 'command', 'english', 'are', 'able', 'act', 'out', 'feelings', 'unbelievable', 'charisma', 'took', 'whole', 'movie', 'higher', 'emotional', 'level', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'movies', 'debut', 'never', 'impress', 'was', 'breath-taking', 'movie', 'perfect', 'ammount', 'determination', 'grief', 'happiness', 'bring', 'character', 'Sayuki', 'life', 'Being', 'Malaysian', 'myself', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'certainly', 'home', 'country', 'proud', 'being', 'regal', 'self', 'commanding', 'respect', 'scene', 'Gong', 'Li', 'least', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'role', 'Hatsumomo', 'can', 'see', 'effects', 'tormented', 'life', 'how', 'more', 'what', 'feel', 'angry', 'same', 'time', 'heart', 'out', 'Wonderful', 'performance', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'was', 'bit', 'miscast', 'Chairman', 'probably', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'used', 'kick-a', 'roles', 'movies', 'Last', 'Samurai', 'Batman', 'seeing', 'here', 'channeling', 'romance', 'poetry', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'me.The', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'brilliant', 'so', 'much', 'color', 'music', 'breathed', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'attack', 'sensors', 'good', 'way', 'direction', 'was', 'alrite', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'would', 'say', 'Rob', 'Marshall', 'pull', 'off', 'lot', 'money', 'shots', 'here', 'especially', 'take', 'Japanese', 'traditions', 'swirling', 'kimonos', 'sumo', 'wrestling', 'wooden', 'houses', 'oh-so-amazing', 'geisha', 'dances.But', 'end', 'what', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'truely', 'great', 'better', 'screenplay', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'everything', 'hoped', 'can']",N/A

Originally, Maggie Cheung was supposed to play Sayuri and that Steven Spielberg was to take the helm as a Director but negotiation seemed to stall.  Anyway, it raised eyebrow when Rob Marshall was given the Director's role and that Chinese actresses were cast to play the main characters.  I have had seen many wonderful Japanese period movies in my lifetime and it's true that there are many able Japanese actresses that are able to play the parts with their eyes closed.  However, this movie isn't meant for the Japanese market only and that this movie is meant for worldwide release and a calculative risk needs to be taken.  There were some rather rude remarks from Time magazine readers that Chinese actresses were in favour because they are marketed better than the Japanese, which I find untrue at all.  Ultimately, I find that those Japanese actors and actresses who are showing willingness to master English language would find themselves just as accessible as the Chinese.  Watanabe Ken is obviously in favour now after his strong presence in the Last Samurai and the fact that his English is improving by days.  Michelle Yeoh has always been known as a team player and she speaks English proficiently.  Then, there's Gong Li who has been darling to the international movie scenes for years and she was even a jury in the Sundance Festival before.  Last but not least, Zhang Jiyi never concealed her ambition to rule the world and only last year that she reversed her name structure to coincide with the Western style.  Zhang Jiyi to Jiyi Zhang and that she's basing herself in the States.  All those things certainly made casting easier for the production team and not because there's a racist attitude towards the Japanese.  It's ashamed that Kyoto was only featured sparsely in the movie as geisha collective in Japan was less than impressed that their ""secret"" was out(?)  To prevent a culture from becoming extinct, the essence is to make the culture relevant to the younger generation so that they would embrace it to pass on to the next generation.  The arrogance  and the lacklustre enthusiasm to give this production a helping hand to make it a better movie that it is, this is truly a missed opportunity for Japan to introduce its glorious culture to the rest of the world in its full splendour.  The saying is simple, if you don't have a problem, stop whinging!  Utlimately, I think everyone here tries their best to make it a success and they all deserve a good pat on their shoulders.  People should get over in debating over the authenticity of whatever in this movie and simply enjoy it!  It's almost impossible for the Director to convey all subtleties in the movie in a span of just a bit over two hours.

169167,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,1404983082,"pjf ""pjf""","[6, 6]","I read the book when it first came out, and wasn't terribly impressed by it.  I didn't see the movie at first, because it didn't seem to get the greatest reviews and the book had left me cold.  Then I watched it on cable, and was impressed enough to buy it. What impressed me wasn't just that the film is visually stunning, though it is.  Nor is the storyline itself so compelling at first glance. Not only was it pretty uninspiring as love stories go, but I wasn't too impressed with the ""cinder"" part of this cinderella tale -- young Chiyo actually got an amazing break, in that as an unwanted orphan sold into slavery, she got sold in a pretty good place for her sex and the times -- a place where she would get an expensive education, taught to read and write, learn a profession whereby she'd never even ""have to pour herself a glass of sake because her maids do all that"", etc.  In fact, Chiyo's initial whining and running away I thought was pretty uncharacteristic of what a girl in her position would do, given the realities -- the supposedly dumbwitted Pumpkin was far more savvy and realistic.  It's amazing to me all the reviewers who seem to miss that this is not a tale of a girl in the U.S. in the 21st century.  That being trained as a geisha and given the chance to inherit a valuable geisha house and adopted as a daughter and heir was pretty amazing luck for young Chiyo, if she could have appreciated it -- given she could have landed in far, far worse places from where she came.I spent a lot of the movie wondering about why the narrator seemed to whine so much about Chiyo's unlucky fate - it didn't seem realistic.  But what finally impressed me was the ending, where the narrator, who at times seemed to be over the top in her narration of a pretty basic story (mine is a story that should never be told) finally ended on a very realistic note.  I disagree that she just finally learned of ""kindness, where there had been so much unkindness"".  The Chairman, Mameha, Auntie, Pumpkin and even ""Mother"" were kind to her in their own ways.  But I like the fact that this film, perhaps one of the first that I can recall, apart from perhaps the ""Handmaid's Tale"" talked about how a woman sometimes has to make her happiness out of a glass half full. For an American movie, and a supposed ""cinderella"" romance, that was an amazing leap.  This was a Cinderella tale where Cinderella doesn't really get the prince.  She's not a fairy tale princess: as she says, she's  ""not an ""empress, nor a queen"".  Finally and at the end, she makes no apologies for what she is, and for making her happiness out of what she can.  As she says, hers are memoirs of another kind. Whatever you think of the life of a geisha, (and some reviewers have perhaps deservedly panned the glorification of prostitution etc.) there is the fact that this was a different culture.  Chiyo, who seemed to rail against her fate with almost 21st century female expectations does an abrupt about face at the end. While disconcerting, what I found valuable and in some ways unique is that we don't see too many movies that hold out the illusion of a fairy tale ending and then unapologetically illustrate the half measures that women sometimes have to settle for, and find happiness with.  That I found interesting, even intriging. I'm not sure how well it hangs together as a movie or a book. It seems inconsistent to say the least. But I liked that she finally recognized it, and that the author and film didn't try to sell us the pretense of a real fairy tale ending where none existed.  She made her happiness where she could.  While not acceptable in this day and age, it was for her and I can only applaud that she could find her glass half full and not apologize for it.That said, I wish more time had been spent on the two girls, Chiyo and Pumpkin and their training, and lives.  The extras in this DVD go into that a little more and I found that very interesting.  I also went back after watching the movie and read the book again, and this was one of those rare times when I thought the movie as good or better than the book, and surprisingly faithful to the book.

M Simon ""El Simon Asombroso""","[17, 35]","When director Rob Marshall set out to make a film version of Arthur Golden's meticulous ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", I had high hopes.  As someone who lived 17 years in East Asia and speaks several of the languages, I was truly looking forward to the product.  The book centered on Sayuri, a young girl taken into training to be a Geisha and living through a tumultuous two decades from 1929-1949 or so.However, the film lost all of the detail and magic of the book and became mainly a scene of tight, obviously on-set shots of a little neighborhood and a lot of cat-fight interpersonal dynamic between rival Geishas.  The beauty and horror of pre-war Japan and especially the years of meticulous Geisha training were left out (the training was covered in a quicky montage, not much better than the parody song of such in ""Team America"").If the horrible adaptation wasn't enough, portraying the Americans as nothing but corrupt, drunken, whore-mongering simpletons was offensive.  Also, casting so many non-Japanese as Japanese was a true insult to the people of Japan.  Zhang ZiYi is lovely but she doesn't look or act Japanese.  It was like seeing Jaques Chirac play Bill Clinton or stubby little Jude Law play a brawny American hero (Oh, wait, that was already done in Sky Captain and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, wasn't it?

169169,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,1404983082,Pristine,"[10, 11]","Oh dear.  Where to begin?  I watched the movie, all of the DVD extras on Disk 2, I read the opposing Amazon reviews, and also the original Arthur Golden book.  Since every like/dislike under the sun seem already to have been voiced here, I will stay away from repeating and becoming a statistic.  Before I go on, let me just say Memoirs of A Geisha pales in comparison to Hideo Gosha's 1983 film ""The Geisha."" The superb acting, combined with the authentic Japanese-ness and the beautifully photographed ""The Geisha"" puts that film in a league of its own.Three things you should know before you begin criticizing this movie.  1) The creators repeated several times in the DVD Extra Disk 2 that their movie is an impression, not a documentary.  2)This is an American movie made in Hollywood.  3) This is a movie based on a book written by a Caucasian writer based on his interviews with a geishas, one of which was Iwasaki Mineko, who went on to write her own account called A Life (because she felt Golden had twisted the real story too much).Ok. Item 1.  I found the DVD Disk 2 more entertaining than the movie itself, because it put the movie next to historical archives.  It was the creators' way, I felt, of giving the actual historical facts some airtime.  Watching DVD Disk 2 will help straighten out many of the arguments presented here in the Amazon reviews.  The creators of MOAG did consult Liza Dalby, an author herself of several books on Geishas and Japanese kimonos.  So if they wanted to, they could have devoted a large percentage of their resources towards getting the historical details fairly accurate.  However, the creators stressed several times that MOAG was an impression, not a documentary.  This impressionistic license means that the architecture, the kimonos, the Geisha life, dance, routine, hair, makeup are all based loosely on the actual facts.  The set designer (a Hollywood set designer) went to Japan for a few weeks and distilled a little bit from one building, and some more from another, and threw it all together in a (con)fusion of anachronistic and cross-cultural impressionistic town sitting in the backlot of a California town.  The costume maker, another non-Japanese who does not specialize in kimonos, did some research and started churning out a kimono every few weeks (where the real one takes a year and cost what an average Japanese man might make working full time for a year).  Rob Marshall, the director of Chicago (and dancer/choreographer by profession) jazzes up the Geisha dance routine, requests that his version of the Geisha is presented as ""supermodels of their day.""  The silhouette of MOAG's geishas are almost wasp-waisted, where the actual Geishas of that time emphasized cylindrical form in their kimono profile.Japanophiles and Japanese people will undoubtedly scream murder, and they have the right to.  However, if you keep in mind that MOAG is the product of the Western imagination, you will be able to watch the movie as entertainment.  It would have been nice if they got the details spot on, but I doubt it will make the mainstream audience love it more.Item 2. This is an American movie made in Hollywood, produced by Steven Spielberg.  People who have watched Wim Wenders's documentary Room 666 (where famous directors were asked about the future of cinema) will remember a long list of non-American directors carrying on about technology, craft, and the art of moviemaking, only to be followed by Spielberg, who sounded like an accountant whose primary concern was the bottom line.  He talked about financing, funds, box office returns, and then he talked some more about money.  Nothing wrong with that, but it explains the decisions they made for MOAG.  You could make a movie with authentic Japanese actors speaking Japanese, with Shakuhachi, koto, and shamisen laden soundtrack, and get consultation from everyone from the Learning Channel to the History Channel.  But on opening night, the cinema will have only a handful of seats occupied by stuffy academics and bookworms.  Instead, take John Williams's music, throw in Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, then use all the biggest recognizable Asian actors in America, make it pretty, and pace it for American consumption.  What do you get?  Academy awards, money in the bank, and most importantly, thousands of people with newly whetted appetites who want to learn more about Japanese culture.  The ones who have the conscientiousness to research further, will eventually obtain the accurate details anyway.I'm not saying I understand this approach, but I do understand that this is an American movie made for American consumption.Item 3. This movie is based on a book written by a Caucasian writer.  Epistemologically speaking, this movie is already three steps removed from fact, if you count Mineko's self-editing in re-telling her story.  There's also the case of Mineko who did not speak English as a first language, and Golden who did not speak Japanese as a first language.  There's a wide chasm between transmission and perception even by the time the story reaches book form.  Art is not always obligated to truth.  And the history of art has always been driven by what each interpreted work (in each artist's reiteration of the fashionable themes of his or her day) revealed about the interpreter and not the interpreted.  If Marshall is a choreographer, then it is only logical that he speaks in a medium he is most familiar with, dance.Though quality is not being questioned here, I am reminded of digital photography's golden rule: if you don't begin with the best original picture, subsequent edits can only go downhill from there.  Both Golden and Rob Marshall never pretended they know what goes on in the pure Japanese consciousness when they dispatch their respective versions of MOAG.  What I know of Japanese consciousness comes from zen koans, kimonos, the art of Ike no Taiga and Tawaraya Sotatsu, but I can tell you Memoirs of a Geisha has very little evidence of it.With all that said, I thought the movie was watchable, and it was not slow.  People who complained about Zhang Ziyi's acting may want to be reminded of the Japanese classical tradition of Noh, where masks are worn during the performance, and facial expressions hidden.  Combined this with the Japanese tendency to subtlety and hidden connotations, and you begin to realize maybe restraint was an intention, and expecting her to act like Lindsay Lohan may be slightly ethnocentric.  Michelle Yeoh does a good job being the stately mentor to Sayuri, but her curiously orange hair did raise my eyebrows.  I think the opening of the movie left out an important part of the book.  We don't really know the reasons why Tanaka sold the two little girls to the okiya.  In the book, we know that their parents were very poor and they lived in a country fishing village.  The father was barely making ends meet, and the mother was dying.  It could be proposed that the parents agreed to their girls being sold off because that was, by comparison, a better life than that which they could barely offer.  If you begin on this premise, then it gives you a very different perception of what it meant to be a geisha, even though geishas are correctly depicted as people who did not have a choice.The movie is paced better than the book, and it made a story (that is already geared for public consumption) move right along.  However, there were dozens of times where I found myself saying ""gosh, if I hadn't read the book, I could not make the leap from the previous scene to this one.""  For example, we see Hatsumomo finding Sayuri's face on a poster.  All that is left out includes the detail that Mameha's meteoric rise to fame came from her appearance on a poster for a celebrated annual festival.  In the book, Mameha choreographed a very Japanese ""dance"" where Sayuri goes to the poster artist's disheveled studio and hangs out until the ""suggestion"" is ""introduced"" to him that he has a brilliant idea of using Sayuri for a model.  These low-key transactions are what reminds me of traditional Asian (and Japanese) etiquette.For the purpose of the movie though, I guess it was enough to tell what it needed to tell.So if you can suspend your allegiance to factual and historical details for two hours, then it's entertainment in the form we recognize it to be.  Suzuka Ohgo as the young Chiyo is absolutely adorable, and the movie is a good (but light) exposure for some of the biggest Chinese actresses working today.  Gong Li's Hatsumomo translates onscreen better than it did in the novel, as her character, like Golden's story, is really about the passing of time. Watch the dvd extra on Disk 2 to round up your Hollywood intro to Geishas.  If you want to go deeper and enter the actual Japanese world of storytelling, one can start with Mizoguchi, Kurosawa, and Ozu.  There is also a whole pantheon of Japanese films that never make it to the US.  Film lovers owe it to themselves to explore the birthplace of Clint Eastwood westerns, Star Wars, and some of Jacques Rivette's most memorable masterpieces.",3,"A Piece of Art, Not a

This beautiful atmospheric portrait of longing is drenched in rain and snow with moments of emotional depth and chemistry between characters. The entire movie is art in motion as oceans set a stormy atmosphere, almost a metaphor for a Sayuri's inner turmoil.In the profound stillness of simplicity, the Geisha's existence revolves around the visual pleasure they bring to men. While the men show appreciation in gifts, it is the women who withhold the gifts of nourishment and emotional support.The story is intriguing and the mystery surrounding Sayuri's new discoveries captures your attention throughout the movie. However there is an element of discomfort in her desires for the man she meets while still a child. I personally preferred the relationships she encountered while working as a Geisha because then her choices were based less on needing a father figure and more on an attraction of intellectual equals or at least, a mature relationship with emotional depth.After viewing this movie, I only ask myself: ""Would I have been happier if then ending had been slightly more like I expected?"" Who knew that at the start they would claim the lifestyle was a painting, only to then splatter paint on the floor. For me, this movie had conflicts of interest and the story's bittersweet beauty dissolves into footsteps across stone. My heart sank in places I expected it to swim. The depth of connection seemed somewhat lacking due to limited moments of communication between the two main characters. How do you fall in love with someone you hardly speak to? Even if you did fall in love at ""first sight,"" there would be more than moments of eye contact.The music was still impressive and captured the heart of the movie. How I wished for a more heart-wrenching ending and more twists of the heart in the plot. The purity I wished for in the mystery of the lifestyle seemed to dissolve in places.If you watch this for Chiyo/Sayuri's life and the sheer beauty of the cinematography, you may still come away thinking this is quite a beautiful movie. For me, the most memorable scene is Chiyo on the roof overlooking the city. At that point, she stole my heart. The beauty of Memoirs of a Geisha seems to be in the heart of Chiyo where she retains her innocence and romantic longings.~The Rebecca Review",4,Eyes the Color of Rain,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,2455,"['Water', 'can', 'carve', 'way', 'even', 'stone.And', 'when', 'trapped', 'water', 'new', 'path', 'was', 'great', 'expectation', 'watched', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'beautiful', 'atmospheric', 'portrait', 'longing', 'drenched', 'rain', 'snow', 'moments', 'emotional', 'depth', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'entire', 'movie', 'art', 'motion', 'oceans', 'set', 'stormy', 'atmosphere', 'almost', 'metaphor', 'Sayuri', 'inner', 'profound', 'stillness', 'simplicity', 'Geisha', 'existence', 'visual', 'pleasure', 'bring', 'men', 'men', 'show', 'appreciation', 'gifts', 'women', 'who', 'withhold', 'gifts', 'nourishment', 'emotional', 'support.The', 'story', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Sayuri', 'new', 'discoveries', 'attention', 'movie', 'However', 'element', 'discomfort', 'desires', 'man', 'still', 'child', 'personally', 'preferred', 'relationships', 'encountered', 'while', 'working', 'Geisha', 'then', 'choices', 'were', 'based', 'less', 'needing', 'father', 'figure', 'more', 'attraction', 'intellectual', 'equals', 'least', 'mature', 'relationship', 'emotional', 'depth.After', 'viewing', 'movie', 'only', 'ask', 'Would', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'then', 'ending', 'had', 'been', 'slightly', 'more', 'expected', 'Who', 'knew', 'start', 'would', 'claim', 'lifestyle', 'was', 'painting', 'only', 'then', 'splatter', 'paint', 'floor', 'movie', 'had', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'story', 'bittersweet', 'beauty', 'footsteps', 'stone', 'heart', 'sank', 'places', 'expected', 'swim', 'depth', 'connection', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'due', 'limited', 'moments', 'communication', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'How', 'do', 'fall', 'love', 'someone', 'hardly', 'speak', 'Even', 'did', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'moments', 'eye', 'contact.The', 'music', 'was', 'still', 'impressive', 'captured', 'heart', 'movie', 'How', 'wished', 'more', 'heart-wrenching', 'ending', 'more', 'twists', 'heart', 'plot', 'purity', 'wished', 'mystery', 'lifestyle', 'seemed', 'dissolve', 'places.If', 'watch', 'Chiyo/Sayuri', 'life', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'cinematography', 'may', 'still', 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'most', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Chiyo', 'roof', 'overlooking', 'city', 'point', 'stole', 'heart', 'beauty', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'be', 'heart', 'Chiyo', 'where', 'innocence', 'romantic', 'longings.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

169174,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,1404983082,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[4, 6]","'Memoirs of a Geisha' is one of my favourite novels of all time. I was very worried about this movie, I have to say. I was expecting some horribly westernised and dumbed-down version of the text, but I have to say, I was very pleased with the end result. Okay, so it's not as deep or as evocative as the novel, and yes, in places the Spielbergisms (he was, after all, a Producer) are garish and out-of-place, but overall, the movie remains very faithful to the feel of the book, and, for a nice change, has a beautifully sympathetic screenplay by Robin Swicord, and Rob Marshall's direction is superlative.Casting is actually fabulous; Ken Wanatabe as Chairman Iwamura Ken is perfect - maybe a little younger at the film's end than I was expecting, but he's a great actor anyway, and in what I believe is his first romantic lead in a western picture, turns in a very convincing performance. Gong-Li is a perfect, perfect Hatsumomo - it's great to see one of my favourite literary characters of all time brought so fluently and vibrantly alive. Zhang Ziyi is an inexperienced actress and doesn't perhaps bring as much depth to the character of Sayuri as one would have hoped, but for the tone of the movie, she's very well-paced. Michelle Yeoh, as always, does a great job playing Michelle Yeoh. But since the character of Mameha is a benevolent mother-figure anyway, she's also quite convincing.The voiceovers from older Sayuri are fantastic, rather than feeling like a device to keep the movie's running time down, they actually serve to deepen the sense of autobiography that the really quite brilliant screenplay tries to put across. Not much of it is from Golden's original text, but happily, the new dialogue and expressions are, by and large, sympathetic and, more importantly, well-written. Since the voice of Sayuri the elder was such an important tool in the novel, it's hugely gratifying to see that Swicord's writing understands and promotes this in the translation to the big screen. The script also uses common Japanese terms and phrases for added effect - and this works very well.Direction is fabulous, Rob Marshall proves here that he can do historical romances every bit as well as he does glossy musicals and comedies. The scenes where Baron Matsunaga attempts to seduce Sayuri, or Chiyo's arrival at the Okiya, are shot with such an obvious understanding of what Golden's original text was saying, that you can't help but feel Marshall is trying - and succeeding- to be as respectful as possible to the elements that made the novel great.It's not all good news, however, and there are several things in the movie, when one judges it as a movie in its own right, that don't ring true. The first and most important of these is the obvious difficulty the Japanese actresses playing the roles of Mother, Auntie and the younger Chiyo and Pumpkin have with delivering their English lines. Or should that be `engurrish rines' ? Since the lead cast members don't have this trouble, it creates a sense of discord between the excellent main body of the movie and what must be said is a somewhat less-than-convincing beginning. Another complaint is the obvious attempt to `westernise' the story to make it more accessible for western audiences - various elements such as Sayuri's fight with Hatsumomo or Mameha's relationship with her Danna are overstated and glaringly obvious, and lack the subtlety of the rest of the movie. Which makes no sense, really, when you consider that the original novel was by an American, and for a primarily English-speaking audience.Still, `Memoirs' is a great movie; respectful of, if not totally faithful to, the wundernovel that spawned it, I came away from it with the same sense of awe and delightedness that I did when I closed the book.

Her less attractive sister is sent away to a house of prostitution, and Chiyo is given domestic tasks until the time when she can be trained to be a geisha....Naturally, the main appeal of the film is the glimpse into the true nature of the geisha... How a geisha becomes a pinnacle of elegance and class, a master of entertainment and a royal agent of many gentle graces, how she sells her skills and not her body, how she can be the keeper of traditional arts, and how she can stop a man in his tracks with only one look... Yet the film postulates that a geisha's ultimate goal is her debut as a flamboyant dancer, sell her virginity, and pride herself on being well paid for it...The film's photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly, and Ziyi Zhang overflows with sensitivity, delicacy, and sensuality...Zhang has ""the sea in her eyes."" She is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the tender mood of every man, the quality of being graceful, the gentlemen's companion enclosed by an ever-changing Japan towards the start of World War II... The apprentice courtesan stretches the limits of realism for her lifelong devotion to a mysterious wealthy benefactor whose kindness to Sayuri as a child left a lasting impression... Sayuri preferred not to insist on her affection, even when time and circumstance conspire to take her away from the man she loves for years at a time, and was subjected to dramatic situations by the rivalry between the opposing Geisha houses...""Memoirs of a Geisha"" does not submit all its secrets on first viewing; there are many layers of meaning and mystery to be seen again and again...

The movie shows us the inner workings of this strange and exotic world - the rules, the rituals, the internecine conflicts and the ultimate dehumanization of the women therein.  Yet, it does so in such a cliched, prettified way that the sharpness of the message winds up getting blunted, smoothed over, and ultimately contradicted in the process.Dion Beebe's Oscar-winning cinematography (though actually not as impressive as the work in either ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""The New World,"" which were also nominated), along with the ravishing costumes and sets, does indeed create a lovely tableau of 1940's Japan, but often at the expense of the theme, which is to show us the UGLINESS not the beauty of that world.The tale is largely slow-paced and languid, with the first section, in particular, playing a bit like an Oriental version of a Charles Dickens melodrama.

This is a color film but the opening sequence is monochromatic with the ocean black and the foam white -- a beautifully photographed sequence.  I was very taken by the beauty of this sequence but there were many excellent shots throughout the film.  The cinematography was top quality.  This is a relatively sad film although it does end happily -- well more or less.  The film is set in pre and post WWII Japan.  The pre-war sequences give you a real feel for the Japanese culture of Geisha at the time.  This is important for the contrast in the post-war sequences.  I was especially taken by the Americans in the post-war sequences.  There were very few lines spoken but the contrast was vivid.  This contrast wasn't actually intended to be negative but I think was intended to show the clash of cultures as seen through the eyes of the Geisha, which I think was really well done.  The director handled this very well.I am not an expert in Japanese Culture but from what little I know and have read I think the make-up and dress used for the Geisha's was not authentic and westernized or at least modernized for western taste.  However, that is a really trivial criticism.  This was a beautiful film, well done, well costumed, with excellent direction and a moving story. The world of Geisha is disappearing in Japan and even the Japanese culture that you see in the pre-war sequences is vanishing if not already gone.

169186,AX7Q8AOSGGVWJ,1404983082,"Sakuteiki ""sakuteiki""","[7, 8]","Many reviewers who grant Memoirs of a Geisha one or two stars mention they still purchased the DVD.I practice martial arts daily and perform Japanese dance. Dressing in kimono requires an hour (rushing) with assistance setting neckline, placing numerous undergarments and padding necessary for the kimono to drape properly, tying obi, placing kanzashi (bira-bira  or omiyage)The Secret World of Geishas Discovery Channel. The narrow tightly wrapped kimono limits stride. Dancing in split toe zori or geta is taxing, trying to not fall or twist one's ankle. Occupying the hands with dance fans, hats, dance sticks demands concentration simply to remain upright.Frightening scene in Memoirs: baron (older sister Mameha's danna patron) tries to ""see"" what Sayuri looks like under her kimono; many carefully placed and tied kimono and obi layers are stripped from her one by one, in terrifying reminder of helpless geisha unable to offer resistance in male dominated Japan.The Girl With the Dragon TattooGeisha begin at age 6years 6months 6days learning Geisha artsGeisha. I perform Japanese dance since 2000 and am unable to dance solo; learning evocative steps as an adult dancer-actor on platform okobo must be athletically demanding. Michelle Yeoh (ethnic Chinese Malaysian) is a martial arts master who studied classical ballet in London. Ziyi Zhang (Chinese) is a classical dancer and martial arts practitioner as well. The actors collaborated in Oscar best filmCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Ziyi Zhang reveals athletic prowess in martial arts inHouse of Flying Daggersas well.Director Marshall needed graceful athletically limber dancer-actors capable of absorbing 10 years of geisha training in shamisen, fan, kimono, fish-tail gait, sitting, serving tea and dance in a 6 week rehearsal prior to filming. All actors, Malaysian, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese, etc. memorized lines in phonetic English, were only able to acquire dignified comportment, grace, dance, etc. in the restricted rehearsal time due to prior mastery of skills as linguists, actors, and dancers.If one compares Memoirs to Japanese classic DVD Samurai Rebellion directed by Masaki Kobayashi, starring Toshiro Mifune, parallels are evident: emotions rigidly restrained even in the face of rape, societal demands for female acceptance and discretion in abysmal circumstances, subtle sadness and overt tension in public face vs. private agony and despair.At rehearsal Japanese dancers are voluble, laughing with ribald jokes (cannot pronounce letter ""l"" so instead of using word clap, say kachung) But during performance, only aesthetically pleasing demeanor appears. Japanese dance is slowly repetitive, like watching grass grow: sedate emotionally placid on the surface, intense with meaning below if well understood. The same disconnect occurs between public and private life of 1920s geisha, appropriately portrayed onscreen: rigidly mannered in public, feisty volatility in private, always with an undercurrent of melancholy. Even sunlight in Japan postures in a minor key.Geisha Mineko Iwasaki's autobiography Geisha of Gion: The Memoir of Mineko Iwasaki describes a visually lush, emotionally barren life; as the most celebrated geisha of all time, she was tortured by a real life rival like Hatsumomo (Gong Li) and retired from geisha life. The oldest working geisha is 94.Nobu is played by Koji Yakusho star of the original JapaneseShall We Dance?His confrontation with Sayuri when he believes she is arranging a liaison with another man is passionate and humiliating: unrequited love as physical pain.The art of geisha demands so much rehearsal, preparation, performance, entertainment work time there is no space for romance, marriage, family. Geisha drink alcohol to entertain. If geisha marries, she abandons geisha life.Sayuri's water theme played by Yo Yo Ma on cello, and Chairman's theme played by Itzak Perlman on violin are tributes to John Williams' composition.Compare Memoirs to the British restraint ofPersuasionwith Amanda Root and Ceiran Hinds, the contained emotion ofJane Eyre (BBC, 1983)with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark as a fiery child who learns to withhold emotions after years of abuse (not unlike the life of geisha), and the misdirection wrought by hidden passion inPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)with Colin Firth. Superficial containment may cloak longing and suffering.Memoirs has humor: 15 year old Sayuri opens the door to the famous geisha Mameha sneaking a look over her shoulder, Sayuri's hair is ratted and waxed, she then tries to sleep on a wooden head rest omaku to protect the styling (maiko have their own hair dressed, later when they are full geisha they wear wigs), Sayuri's leg is cut by Mameha, her stage fright prior to her debut, Sayuri slips off her geta then causes a boy to fall from his bike with a mere glance.See alsoDeparturesabout healing and forgiveness, James Clavell's Shogun 15hour

169188,A32XW50ILWOXNO,1404983082,Samuel McKewon,"[1, 1]","Rob Marshall`s ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" doesn't have an ounce of gray in it. There's black, and white, bold, blood red, deep aqua blue and sunlight river gold. But no subtlety, no nuance. Wall-to-wall melodrama, it opens on a stormy night and closes on a blooming lagoon. It's a prestige picture succeeding in escapism and the enjoyment of watching catty, beautiful women prance around in thousand-dollar costumes.Geisha houses were popular in Japan for centuries through the 1950s; they still operate, I suppose, in their own way as escort services, though girls are no longer sold into the profession in elementary school and then trained for ten years before their virginity is sold to the highest-bidding client. It's formal prostitution, though Marshall and Co. would like us to think the long, long (long) smoldering affair between Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) and ""The Chairman"" (Ken Watanabe) is a kind of forbidden love.For years it doesn't seem Sayuri, born with sky blue eyes, will be anything more than janitor of her house, so manipulated she is by the house's best-earning geisha Hatsumomo (GongLi, excellent) a jealous vamp skilled in flirt and theft. Hatsumomo sizes up her much-younger housemate and decides Sayuri's friend, the clumsy Pumpkin (Youki Kudoh) will be easier to control.It isn't until a classier geisha named Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) recognizes Sayuri's beauty and potential talent that Sayuri is allowed to go to school, learn the art of sexual insinuation and eventually debut in a light-and-sound performance suitable for a high-class strip joint.  Through these formative years she must duel with Hatsumomo until the inevitable showdown, when House Mother (Kaori Momoi) must choose heir house heir and the vamp discovers the wunderkind's crush on The Chairman, who once treated Sayuri to a sno-cone.Does it sound trite? Oh, it's a soap opera.  But ""Memoirs Of A Geisha"" with its top-shelf production values, presents one visual flourish after another. Zhang and Yeoh, sensing larger access to Hollywood, deliver sincere performances. And there's a great villain in Gong Li, who at 40 must play a 22-year-old - and sneers and snorts her way to stealing the movie.But Hatsumomo exits the movie two-thirds of the way through and the movie must shift to Sayuri's trials through the end of World War II, the destruction of Japan, and eventual rebuilding, when the Chairman requests her service for a few American generals to help secure an industrial contract. Sayuri returns to her old station and finds her friend Pumpkin part of the arrangement, and different than Sayuri remembered.Maybe Marshall (""Chicago"") has directed the best movie he could about  geishas; maybe that's why Steven Spielberg dropped out to make the equally controversial, but far more substantive ""Munich."" Marshall certainly made the most commercial movie he could have, and DVD viewers - especially women in that ""Oprah"" season of life - may be surprised that a movie so smacked around by critics is also compulsively watchable. It's pure confection, sweet, empty, guilty, filled to the gut musical up swell and dramatic closeups. I doubt all this flies too close to mundane, emotionally cloaked lifestyle of a real geisha, and it doesn't completely succeed as a romantic picture because the love story engine peters out. Watanabe's character is so distant and vanilla that his relationship with Sayuri, whatever the resolution, lacks even an implicit passion to it. We're left to enjoy the catty duel between Hatsumomo and Sayuri in the movie's middle as Edith Wharton meets Quentin Tarantino.",3,Geisha Wars!,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,3587,"['Rob', 'Marshall', 's', 'Memoirs', 'A', 'Geisha', ""n't"", 'have', 'ounce', 'gray', 'black', 'white', 'bold', 'blood', 'red', 'deep', 'aqua', 'blue', 'sunlight', 'river', 'gold', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'Wall-to-wall', 'melodrama', 'stormy', 'night', 'closes', 'blooming', 'lagoon', 'prestige', 'picture', 'succeeding', 'escapism', 'enjoyment', 'watching', 'catty', 'beautiful', 'women', 'prance', 'thousand-dollar', 'costumes.Geisha', 'houses', 'were', 'popular', 'Japan', 'centuries', '1950s', 'still', 'operate', 'suppose', 'own', 'way', 'escort', 'services', 'girls', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'sold', 'profession', 'elementary', 'school', 'then', 'trained', 'ten', 'years', 'virginity', 'sold', 'highest-bidding', 'client', 'formal', 'prostitution', 'Marshall', 'Co.', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'long', 'long', 'long', 'smoldering', 'affair', 'Sayuri', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'Chairman', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'kind', 'forbidden', 'love.For', 'years', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Sayuri', 'born', 'sky', 'blue', 'eyes', 'will', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'janitor', 'house', 'so', 'manipulated', 'house', 'best-earning', 'geisha', 'Hatsumomo', 'GongLi', 'excellent', 'jealous', 'vamp', 'skilled', 'flirt', 'theft', 'Hatsumomo', 'up', 'much-younger', 'housemate', 'Sayuri', 'friend', 'clumsy', 'Pumpkin', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'control.It', ""n't"", 'classier', 'geisha', 'named', 'Mameha', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'Sayuri', 'beauty', 'potential', 'talent', 'Sayuri', 'allowed', 'go', 'school', 'learn', 'art', 'sexual', 'insinuation', 'eventually', 'debut', 'light-and-sound', 'performance', 'suitable', 'high-class', 'strip', 'joint', 'formative', 'years', 'must', 'duel', 'Hatsumomo', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'when', 'House', 'Mother', 'Kaori', 'Momoi', 'must', 'choose', 'heir', 'house', 'heir', 'vamp', 'wunderkind', 'crush', 'Chairman', 'who', 'once', 'treated', 'Sayuri', 'sno-cone.Does', 'sound', 'trite', 'Oh', 'soap', 'opera', 'Memoirs', 'A', 'Geisha', 'top-shelf', 'production', 'values', 'one', 'visual', 'flourish', 'Zhang', 'Yeoh', 'sensing', 'larger', 'access', 'Hollywood', 'deliver', 'sincere', 'performances', 'great', 'villain', 'Gong', 'Li', 'who', '40', 'must', 'play', '22-year-old', 'sneers', 'way', 'stealing', 'movie.But', 'Hatsumomo', 'movie', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'movie', 'must', 'shift', 'Sayuri', 'trials', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'destruction', 'Japan', 'eventual', 'rebuilding', 'when', 'Chairman', 'service', 'few', 'American', 'generals', 'help', 'secure', 'industrial', 'contract', 'Sayuri', 'old', 'station', 'friend', 'Pumpkin', 'part', 'arrangement', 'different', 'Sayuri', 'remembered.Maybe', 'Marshall', 'Chicago', 'directed', 'best', 'movie', 'could', 'about', 'geishas', 'maybe', 'why', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'dropped', 'out', 'make', 'equally', 'controversial', 'far', 'more', 'substantive', 'Munich', 'Marshall', 'certainly', 'made', 'most', 'commercial', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'especially', 'women', 'Oprah', 'season', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'movie', 'so', 'smacked', 'critics', 'also', 'compulsively', 'watchable', 'pure', 'confection', 'sweet', 'empty', 'guilty', 'filled', 'gut', 'musical', 'up', 'swell', 'dramatic', 'closeups', 'doubt', 'too', 'close', 'mundane', 'emotionally', 'cloaked', 'lifestyle', 'real', 'geisha', ""n't"", 'completely', 'succeed', 'romantic', 'picture', 'love', 'story', 'engine', 'peters', 'out', 'Watanabe', 'character', 'so', 'distant', 'vanilla', 'relationship', 'Sayuri', 'resolution', 'even', 'implicit', 'passion', ""'re"", 'left', 'enjoy', 'catty', 'duel', 'Hatsumomo', 'Sayuri', 'movie', 'middle', 'Edith', 'Wharton', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino']",N/A

This is the story of the life of Chiyo, a woman that as a child was sold by her father, and separated from her sister. She ends up in an okiya, a geisha house, facing even tougher challenges, such as being hated by the ""star"" geisha of the place. When she was bordering despair, and ready to give up, the kindness of a stranger motivates her to become a geisha, which she sees as a stepping stone for bigger and better things. After that we witness a journey that is full of emotion, suspense, deceit and even redemption. To tell you the truth, it feels like an epic story.I was impresses with the enormous amount of information that this film delivers regarding Japanese culture and uses. Even though I am familiar with several aspects of it, I was surprised and challenged while trying to take all the nuances in. The wardrobes and environment are beautifully recreated, and the cinematography is impressive. Even though the transfer to blu-ray was not as good as others, it really helped to accent the breathtaking and colorful landscapes and wardrobes.People that enjoy learning about different cultures and that have a knack for epic stories should consider picking this one up.

I went with a friend to see it on the big screen - and we both loved it.The story begins with two poor sisters being wrenched from their family home and placed in separate Geisha houses, where they are forced to work as slaves. Inspired by a chance meeting with some Geishas, one of the girls vows to become the greatest Geisha in Japan. She quickly learns their secrets, and like a ninja of the senses, becomes a master of the Geisha art. This film is about her trials and tribulations as she struggles to succeed - and find herself in the process. It's the intervention of the Second World War that really moulds the fortunes of the Geisha: will they - and their way of life survive?The most amazing aspect of this film is the scenery and costumes, and the way they are shot - everything is beautiful. Many scenes are so perfect they almost seem like oil paintings, or beautiful enough to reach in and touch.  Although I haven't read the book yet, my friend had - and she said it was very true to the original story, and was exactly as she had imagined it. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it over dinner, and now I'm definitely planning to read the book.Part sweeping historical love story, part social commentary, part war film, this film is like a delicate flower: full of layers and beautiful to watch.

169198,A912C7977MO6O,1404983082,Smallchief,"[5, 7]","""Memoirs of a Geisha"" has three Chinese women playing Japanese geishas, spectacular photography, and an interesting insight into the ""floating world"" of Japan.  Gong Li is the nasty geisha Hatsumomo and Michelle Yeoh is the teacher of the young novice Sayuri, played by Zhang Ziyi -- or Ziyi Zhang as she now seems to be known.  All are exceptionally beautiful women.  The movie is in English, although that is a challenge for many of the actors. Gong Li seems to me to take the award for both beauty and acting.  Even though her English is pretty lousy, she does an effective job of playing the sad, vulnerable harpy Hatsumomo -- an aging, but top geisha who clings desperately to her position when faced by a threat from the young Sayuri.Although a celebration of sorts of the refinements of Japanese culture and its appreciation of beauty, the story is pretty sordid.  Zhang Ziyi is sold by her poor parents into prostitution, but ends up -- Cinderella-like -- as a drudge in a geisha house.  There, she is abused by the horrible Hatsumomo.  Veteran geisha Michelle Yeoh appears on the scene and takes Zhang under her wing and makes her into a geisha of such quality and style that she is able to triumph by selling her virginity in an auction to the highest bidder for a record price. Then, WW II comes along and destroys the geisha's traditional life and forces them to pretend to enjoy life with the loud, insensitive Americans who don't comprehend the finer points of geisha-hood and confuse them with prostitutes -- the difference being, of course, that the virtue of a geisha has a higher price than that of a prostitute.The costumes are gorgeous, Zhang's dance at her coming-out-party is a bit of extraordinary theater, the scenes of sumo wrestling are interesting, the music adds drama to the proceedings, and the movie has the dreamlike quality of an Oriental landscape painting.

The emotional highs and lows, the backstabbing, petty jealousies, maneuvering, and (small group) politicking will hold your interest, but this is not an edge-of-your-seat thriller by any stretch.  It is simply a drama (which happens to be much better than the typical Hollywood drama.)At its core, Memoirs is a love story in an exotic setting.  Love and loyalty are presented in very conventional ways.  Nothing about this film will challenge you to question why this character loves that one or whether one character's loyalty to another is justified.  Though a love story, it's not necessarily a ""chick flick.""  Certainly, love triumphs in the end, the protagonist's dreams become real, and she lives happily ever after.  But, this movie is not drenched with the type of sentimentality that makes American male moviegoers squirm and wish they were anywhere else but watching the movie (at least, perhaps, not until the very end.)  The woman does not win at her lover's expense.  He does not sell his soul, give up his life, to woo her.As good as it is, Memoirs has one significant drawback: it's unoriginal.  It is little more than Cinderella set in war-time Japan.  Cinderella's not a princess but a Geisha.  Prince Charming is a captain of post-war Japanese industry, a close friend to one of the richest men in Japan.  The fairy godmother is another Geisha who takes Chiyo under her wing.  Chiyo promises in the beginning of the film that hers is a tragic tale that should never be lived.  Her warning rings hollow at the end of this rags-to-riches story in which she lands the man of her dreams, her reason for being.  A more interesting (and emotionally challenging) ending might have been the one hinted at just before the close of the film, before the ""twist ending"" that everyone knows is coming.RATING NOTE:  It deserves 5 stars for the acting and cinematography but only about 2 TO 3 stars for the rest of the story.  I give it 4 stars even though I think 3.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.",4,Geisha-rella,1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,2237,"['Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'masterful', 'also', 'expertly', 'performed', 'actor', 'lot', 'credibility', 'emotion', 'his/her', 'role', 'story', 'intriguing', 'bit', 'slow', 'develop', 'emotional', 'highs', 'lows', 'backstabbing', 'petty', 'jealousies', 'maneuvering', 'small', 'group', 'politicking', 'will', 'hold', 'interest', 'not', 'edge-of-your-seat', 'thriller', 'stretch', 'simply', 'drama', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'drama', 'core', 'Memoirs', 'love', 'story', 'exotic', 'setting', 'Love', 'loyalty', 'are', 'presented', 'very', 'conventional', 'ways', 'Nothing', 'film', 'will', 'challenge', 'question', 'why', 'character', 'one', 'one', 'character', 'loyalty', 'justified', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'necessarily', 'chick', 'flick', 'Certainly', 'love', 'triumphs', 'end', 'protagonist', 'dreams', 'become', 'real', 'happily', 'ever', 'movie', 'not', 'drenched', 'type', 'sentimentality', 'American', 'male', 'moviegoers', 'squirm', 'wish', 'were', 'anywhere', 'else', 'watching', 'movie', 'least', 'perhaps', 'not', 'very', 'end', 'woman', 'not', 'win', 'lover', 'expense', 'not', 'sell', 'soul', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'woo', 'her.As', 'good', 'Memoirs', 'one', 'significant', 'drawback', 'unoriginal', 'little', 'more', 'Cinderella', 'set', 'war-time', 'Japan', 'Cinderella', 'not', 'princess', 'Geisha', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'captain', 'post-war', 'Japanese', 'industry', 'close', 'friend', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'Japan', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'Geisha', 'who', 'Chiyo', 'wing', 'Chiyo', 'beginning', 'film', 'hers', 'tragic', 'tale', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'lived', 'warning', 'rings', 'hollow', 'end', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'man', 'dreams', 'reason', 'being', 'more', 'interesting', 'emotionally', 'challenging', 'ending', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'hinted', 'just', 'close', 'film', 'twist', 'ending', 'everyone', 'coming.RATING', 'NOTE', '5', 'stars', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'only', 'about', '2', 'TO', '3', 'stars', 'rest', 'story', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'even', 'think', '3.5', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'rating']",N/A

She gets picked, her sister does not.  Chiyo is tormented by the queen geisha, Hatsumomo, who cavorts with strange young men and walks around with her hair hanging down all the time. In the book, Chiyo learned to give as good as she got with Hatsumomo, but that doesn't happen in the film.  The Chinese actors speak English with at times, almost unintelligible accents, so a lot of the dialogue is missed. Plus, a lot is not explained - for instance when Chiyo's (now Sayuri)mentor says she has an important appointment that she can't break, and Hatsumomo makes a sarcastic remark to her about ""taking care of a nuisance"" that means she is going to get an abortion. The significance of the red ribbon in the hairdo (virgin) is not explained. And geishas paint their lips smaller, and as far as I recall, don't wear false eyelashes.I would say that the book portrayed more heartbreaking realism (betrayal by her father, loss of her sister, and torture at the geisha house)than this film did.

I really enjoyed this film, thanks to the wonderful performances especially by the Meryl Streep of China Gong Li, the new Gong Li, Ziyi Zhang and legendary Martial Arts actress Michelle Yeoh. The film in the begining follows two sisters, the older one is sold to the pleasure distract and the other with the water colored eyes to a Geisha house, also known as the Okiya. As a child Chiyo later played by Ziyi Zhang meets a very nice & charming man named ""The Chairman"", from then on Chiyo makes a promise to herself to become a great Geisha one day, because in that moment of him being nice to her, she fell in love with him. Since Chiyo has beautiful blue eyes, the most requested & top Geisha played brillantly by Gong Li gets jealous of her, worried that one day Chiyo will push her out of the lime light and the house, Hatsumomo (Li) comes up with all kind of dirty little tricks that could get Chiyo kicked out of the Okiya. After Chiyo becomes the most requested Geisha in Japan, mother (Kaori Momoi) the owner of the Okiya names Chiyo now known as Sayuri the heir of the house, Hatsumomo trys to finally put a end to it all by trying to burn the Okiya down. Ever notice that it always ends bad for Gong Li's characters?. After all that the movie does start to drag until the very end when Sayuri tells The Chairman how she feels, the story in many ways is very sad, at the same time it's also like a Cinderella story.

169213,A8BY9TZTKQU3J,1404983082,The Fingers On My Keyboard,"[4, 5]","Readers of Arthur Golden's book would have sympathised with this movie's producers for the fundamental challenge they must have faced with this adaptation: Frequently confronted with the temptation of an investment of judgement in the subject it depicted, it had to steer a course of cultural ambivalence or agnosticism, or, if some manner of an assessment was unavoidable, deal only with aspects that were indubitable and stark for the audience to discern on its own. That its screenplay manages this with some poise, which for the most part is tentative instead of cautious, is just about the only bit of credit it can claim, for in the hands of a lesser cast and director, `Memoirs of a Geisha' could not have been carried by the script alone.For the greater part of this celluloid treatment, before its affecting denouement (and, to a substantial extent, its saving grace), nothing feels compelling. Relationships are for a large part thin and unconvincing. Friendships are not weakly developed, but rivalries and manipulation, usually being the easier to describe, are what mainly characterise the character dynamics. That the young character Chiyo is given a substantial viewing in the beginning, eschewing the domination of the headline stars, is admirable, demonstrating patience in building an emotional foundation to her motivations, but which, eventually with the departure of Suzuka Ohgo, who plays her comfortably, we find doesn't exist strongly enough for the rest of the movie to ride upon. Ken Watanabe's first appearance is a welcome warm presence, but again underwritten, and thus one never sees, until later, how the young to-be meiko could be driven to begin taking resolute steps in her life, every one of which supposedly bringing her closer to him. The script, in presenting Chiyo's cruel childhood, conveniently throws in generic and vague descriptors such as `empty' and `nothing', which do, well, nothing more than refer denotatively to her destitute existence, which anyone would be able to recognise, instead of ploughing into the characteristics of that emptiness: How she had to grow up too quickly, how she became effaced before she knew personality, how she had nothing to hope for or aspire to, nothing laid before her and no one to connect with. Zhang Ziyi's first appearance almost instinctively forces a reflection on her character's preceding experiences on the part of the audience, and it's quite remarkable how simplistic those experiences can come across: In a `tiny little world of women' from the `floating world', aside from the ruthlessness of the people around her and a man she comes attached to, what exactly has she learnt, and how does it steel her for the future?The writing fares better after the movie's first third, when it picks up on some of the subtleties of what Chiyo goes through. Before we see her grown up, the head of the okiya, importantly, tells her, `We are all the family you have now.' That statement encapsulates an examination of the ties she has had with people up to that point and will have beyond, and is a significant mark of the tragedy of her experience: Parents who sold her, a friendship turned acrimonious (with some charming acting from Youki Kudoh), a mentor who plays her like a pawn, and whose apparent concern and kindness are thereby made dubious (Michelle Yeoh, who shows a natural ease with her character), employers who, while seemingly wanting the best for her, have a questionable idea of what that entails, and a poisonous nemesis whom she fears, hates and sympathises with (Gong Li, ever masterful with a ferocious, wine-dark elegance). The writing also picks up on the consequence of the changes in Chiyo's name, and every shift - from Chiyo to Sayuri and then Nitta Sayuri - marks a notable development in the plot and her character. Frequently, we're reminded of how she's chosen to define herself - by becoming an accomplished geisha - and that adds to the bitter-sweetness of the ending, when one wonders whether she's truly found herself, if ever she has at all, and if she ever thought the white painted mask of the geisha would someday come off, in spite of everything that has compelled her to be bound to that identity, if it can be called one.But the movie owes much to a well-chosen cast that taps easily into the emotional wells of their characters, which the shallow writing belies. When Zhang Ziyi first emerges, one sees nothing of her Golden Globe nomination, but in considering her performance in its entirety, her character's transition, from girlish modesty to suspicious but confident tactician, to worldly wise and despairing woman who learns to own herself, is believable. Ken Watanabe commands the screen by simply being on it, and like Yeoh, in the best sense, rarely seems to be acting. The latter performs quite a feat of understatement, rendering Mameha a conceivable, human character, strong, pragmatic and caring in her own way, however misguided, and holding her own very respectably against Zhang's presence as the leading lady while allowing her the space to make her mark as the main actress. Kaori Momoi and Tsai Chin lift their roles from stereotypical Asian caricatures, the former filling the shoes of a benumbed and callous Mother, who always seems vaguely amused by the wretchedness of their circumstances, the latter an affectionate Auntie for whom it visibly hurts to uphold the ways of the okiya with Chiyo. The characters of Nobu and the Baron could almost be replicas of each other, but it's Koji Yakusho and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa who make them distinct, the former a scarred and sad man, the latter a forceful and domineering one who expects to get what he wants. In the spirit of saving the best for last, Gong Li strikes a formidable and venomous figure. Every step of the way we are reminded of a beautiful woman ruined and degraded by her ways, her desires and her jealousies on her chosen path in life. Gong Li is vigorous in her acting, and be it in expressing disdain, anger, pride and wilfulness even in loss, or an intimidating quality, Hatsumomo becomes a full-blooded character, a scarlet whirlwind of vindictiveness and turmoil to be wary of lest she sweeps you off your feet with cunning or seduction. This reviewer would like to see her receive a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Oscars, which, even if she doesn't win for, would provide adequate recognition of her delectable performance here.At the least, where `Memoirs' isn't an emotional experience, it is very much a sensory one. John Williams serves up a fine score with post-modern touches, not so much thematically memorable, unlike most of his scores, as it does play like a seamless, atmospheric suite that puts it more in line with what he did for `A.I.'. The elemental quality in his music is most vital, and Sayuri's Theme perfectly displays a subliminal mind to water (ironically, it's where the overt Japanese touches don't come in and the score attains something ungraspable, but undeniable, that lies somewhere between experiential immersion and the mind of a little girl that Williams is at his best). Rob Marshall displays his eye for beauty here more so than he did in `Chicago', and the images captured, while teetering on the brink of psychedelic monotony after a while, are often ravishing to behold. Where he is noticeably attuned to the nuances of expression, Marshall doesn't hesitate to linger on the face of a character to show her changes in emotion or the turmoil that a skin-deep smile or bewitching gaze tries to conceal. When Hatsumomo is discovered with Koichi, for instance, we see her go from vengefulness, to bitterness, then, with a quick downward teary glare, the sting of separation as Mother declares that the gates be shut. In the same scene, we see Chiyo, first looking up at her in fear, slowly tilt her head down, in silent lamentation of the sordidness that now characterises her world. When Zhang approaches Yeoh later in the movie for aid in becoming a geisha once again, we see the torn smile on Zhang's face as Yeoh presents an old kimono: The hope of success in doing something that will gain her the Chairman's affections, rekindled by Yeoh's helpfulness, the doubt and fear of returning to her early ways, and a part of her that, beyond questioning, loathes the notion of doing so, all written in her strained and teary beam. The greatest moments in the movie that Marshall manages are those such as these, when you're allowed enough time with each character to engage them and find something worth caring about.The best things about the movie meet in its truly moving ending, when the Chairman professes his hidden love for Sayuri, borne for all the years she has tried to work her way to him. In the moment of that confession, Sayuri is forced to look back on everything with a renewed perspective - how so much of the unkindness in her life might have been averted, how she might have avoided shame, how some things didn't have to be endured - and her experiences painfully come full circle. Zhang's performance here - crying with restraint, trembling all over - precisely conveys the utter rush of conflicting and exasperated emotions coursing through her, how she might be angry with the Chairman for indirectly putting her through everything needlessly, even as she is drawn to him uncontrollably, her yearning much too powerful to suppress now that an opportunity has finally presented itself to be with him. Watanabe, both in guilt and compassion, warmly receives her being of inner tumult and soothes her, while tearfully realising what he might have been able to keep her from. The setting for their meeting is apt, bright, colourful and optimistic - a change from the lamp-lit streets where the `wives of nightfall' wandered - and the score reaches an understated climax. What's wonderful is that it all drives home the point that it isn't a perfect ending. In many ways, it's unsatisfactory for Sayuri, but the sensitivity with which this is shown affords a glimpse, before the movie ends, of everything that remains unresolved for her.This isn't a boring movie, but it verges on testing at times. Even in dealing with the fundamental cultural premise, one doesn't get a sense of an informed account with a sincere interest in looking at, what might strike many as, a strange way of life. A few awkward moments in the movie, such as where it deals less than delicately with `the eel that enters the cave', which turns out as an unintentionally comical and gratuitously indiscreet attempt at politeness, don't do anything to help. Thus, even with an awareness that the movie partially, consciously or otherwise, romanticises this aspect of Japanese culture, where holding oneself in dignity is either genuine and fierce self-respect or delusory posturing, it all comes off as a bit of polished - very polished - fluff.2 stars, then, for a story that stays up in the air somewhere in the floating world.",2,A Story From

Often, when Hollywood adapts a popular bestseller to the screen, they are unable to capture the magic of the book.Such is the case with ""Memoirs of a Geisha"", the new film directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") based on the enormously popular book by Arthur Golden. Many, many, many people read and loved the book, which seems odd considering an American male wrote the book, a true testament to the writer's skill. He so successfully made the reader believe he was simply translating the life story of a real Geisha, we ate it up. He brilliantly evoked the time, place and feel of the period, giving us a glimpse of Japan just before the War. It was a great, interesting book.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" did not translate as well to the screen as the loyal fans of the book might have hoped. The film looks great, but it doesn't capture the life of Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang) as well, making her a living, breathing human being.Unable to care for their children, their parents sell Chiyo and her sister, Tanaka, to a Geisha house. Arriving at the house, the sisters are split up and Chiyo grudgingly begins to accept her new life as a housemaid for the domineering Mother. Soon, Hatsumomo (Gong Li, ""Raise the Red Lantern"", ""Farewell, My Concubine""), the Geisha in the house, takes a disliking to Chiyo and proceeds to make her life hell. Soon, Chiyo is off to Geisha school, but events cause her to become an indentured servant within the house. One day, while out doing errands, she meets the Chairman (Ken Watanabe, ""The Last Samurai""). Years later, Chiyo (Ziyi Zhang, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Rush Hour 2"") has grown up and Mameha (Michelle Yeoh, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), a leading Geisha, takes her under her wing to train her.There are two significant problems hindering the film. The first is Ziyi Zhang. She is certainly a beautiful woman, but her acting leaves something to be desired. Throughout, she has trouble with the emotions, the problems of the character, making her believable. She resembles a Geisha performing an interpretation of being a Geisha, robbing the character of lifelike feeling and emotion. Throughout, she seems to turn on the emotion she is meant to felt for that scene, as though the director said ""Sad"", so she feels sad. When the next scene begins, new emotion. These emotions don't appear to be gradual, or real, as she proceeds through the character's life.The other problem is the voice over narration bridges over gaps in the narration, rather than help transition through them. The voice over tells us what to feel rather than reinforces what we feel. Because of this, it feels obtrusive and jarring to suddenly hear something that we had no inkling ever happened.There are a couple of great, visual sequences. One of these shows Sayuri's training to become a Geisha over a very short period of time. The scene is very visual and breathtaking to watch. A series of short, visual shots of various aspects of her education are bridged by transitions following one object from the frame to the next. This sequence, which is very fast, begins to give the viewer a sense of the work and training involved.Michelle Yeoh does a great job as Mameha, the more experienced, kinder mentor Geisha. As she guides Sayuri, Chiyo's adopted Geisha name, through the process, we learn a lot about what their life was like. The traditions, their place in society, the goals they worked towards are all presented by the older mentor. As Yeoh moves gracefully through each scene, she becomes a benevolent judge to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, guiding her, but not afraid to reprimand her for a mistake either. As a result, she guides us through their unusual world.Gong Li is also quite good as Hatsumomo, the Geisha who feels threatened by Chiyo and makes her life a living hell. Clearly, Hatsumomo doesn't entirely buy into the Geisha's world as she is courting a young man who could never afford the charms of a Geisha, but she is deathly afraid of losing any of her standing. As she comes to feel more threatened, she also lashes out more frequently, and in increasingly sadistic methods, tormenting the young Chiyo.Ken Watanabe plays the Chairman, the object of Sayuri's attentions. Throughout the film, forces conspire to keep them apart and he subtly reveals that this is tearing him apart as well.Director Rob Marshall certainly has a visual eye. In all of the scenes set before World War II, the landscapes are occasionally infused with bright, vivid colors. When a person of wealth or influence enters the scene, some bright color almost always accompanies them or is found by the camera. If the scene is set in a predominantly poor area or the people who live there are poor, the colors are washed out. This is a nice reinforcement of how class affected the daily life in Japan during this era.What he doesn't do as well is guide the actors through their performances. This is problematic when the actors are less experienced and need the expertise of an accomplished director. The director needs to coax a subtle, interesting performance out of the actors, and not allow them to simply turn the emotion on and off. Marshall has a keen eye for detail, but needs to develop his skill working with the actors.When the story moves into the phase after World War II, it became even less interesting for me. Anything Zhang Ziyi was able to build with her character was lost as she desperately attempts to become a Geisha once again, to help the Chairman get some American financing. We simply didn't spend enough time with Sayuri as a Geisha to believe that she is now the type of woman who can summon all of her reserves and training and return to a former life. And the reason behind this is, in our modern eyes, slightly creepy to begin with. The actress would have to work very hard to convince us that this is real, to allow us to get beyond the inherently creepy nature of the task. Ziyi can't pull it off and it becomes tedious as we wait for the inevitable conclusion.""Memoirs of a Geisha"" has a few moments that will please fans of the book. If you can catch a bargain matinee, you will probably not felt cheated.",3,Cliffs Notes: Memoirs of a Geisha,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,6293,"['Bestselling', 'books', 'have', 'built', 'audience',

The product is a stunningly beautiful shell with little substance to offer.The story is quite straight forward and honestly not the best. Very clich&eacute; type of story camouflaged by the Geisha sugar coating. The most interesting part of the movie is the training of the Geisha, which unfortunately wasn't long enough. The whole love story is just standard romance with all the standard dramas that really sent you on your nerves.Performance wise, Zhang Ziyi, as usual is fame more than substance. I have no idea why she is so big as she, as an actor, is really very average. She might have the face that the western audience but in terms of skills for the art, she is lacking. The only thing that she doesn't lack is luck. In Geisha, she is always having that no.7 and no.9 facial expression across the two hours and I'm wondering why people aren't sick of it. There are so much more for the character to show but Zhang is just not delivering at all. Similarly, Ken Watanabe's performance is mediocre too. He was best in his first scene and then all the other scenes were like anyone can do it. The leading duo was just disappointing.However, the movie benefited from a superb supporting cast. Gong Li is definitely a screen stealer; especially it's a very different role from the past ones she did in her movies. And she looked different and had a whole different set of mannerisms that acted and behaved like a Japanese. This is where acting skills come in - to make believe and Gong LI certainly managed her craft well. Experience does count I suppose. Michelle Yeoh was also great, despite she looks nowhere like a Japanese. However, she displayed great depth in the her calm, calculative and authoritative aura for her character. The movie will so be much less interesting without these two characters. Other actors like Koji Yokusho, Kaori Momoi, Chin Tsai, Youki Kudo all deliver a spectacular performance. It is very unusual to have a movie so such a strong supporting cast but a very weak leading cast. However, these are the saving grace for the movie, because they keep the movie interesting.Cinematography-wise, it is a straight beautiful piece so well done that every scenes looks like jumping out from a painting. The movie also featured a great soundtrack by John Williams with great performers including Yo Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman. Those are also important major surviving elements for a mediocre production as such.Lastly the narration doesn't really add substance to the movie, so might as well just cut them out most of the time and especially for the ending narration, it was so bad that it made the movie look even more pretentious and unnecessary.",2,An Average Plot Benefited from a Superb Supporting Cast,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,2755,"['Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'attempt', 'Oriental', 'Themed', 'productions', 'product', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'shell', 'little', 'substance', 'offer.The', 'story', 'quite', 'straight', 'forward', 'honestly', 'not', 'best', 'Very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'type', 'story', 'camouflaged', 'Geisha', 'sugar', 'coating', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'training', 'Geisha', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'long', 'enough', 'whole', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'standard', 'romance', 'standard', 'dramas', 'really', 'sent', 'nerves.Performance', 'wise', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'usual', 'fame', 'more', 'substance', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'so', 'big', 'actor', 'really', 'very', 'average', 'might', 'have', 'face', 'western', 'audience', 'terms', 'skills', 'art', 'lacking', 'only', 'thing', ""n't"", 'lack', 'luck', 'Geisha', 'always', 'having', 'no.7', 'no.9', 'facial', 'expression', 'two', 'hours', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'why', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'sick', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'show', 'Zhang', 'just', 'not', 'delivering', 'Similarly', 'Ken', 'Watanabe', 'performance', 'mediocre', 'too', 'was', 'best', 'first', 'scene', 'then', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'anyone', 'can', 'do', 'leading', 'duo', 'was', 'just', 'disappointing.However', 'movie', 'benefited', 'superb', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Gong', 'Li', 'definitely', 'screen', 'stealer', 'especially', 'very', 'different', 'role', 'past', 'ones', 'did', 'movies', 'looked', 'different', 'had', 'whole', 'different', 'set', 'mannerisms', 'acted', 'behaved', 'Japanese', 'where', 'acting', 'skills', 'come', 'make', 'believe', 'Gong', 'LI', 'certainly', 'managed', 'craft', 'well', 'Experience', 'count', 'suppose', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'nowhere', 'Japanese', 'However', 'displayed', 'great', 'depth', 'calm', 'calculative', 'authoritative', 'aura', 'character', 'movie', 'will', 'so', 'be', 'much', 'less', 'interesting', 'two', 'characters', 'Other', 'actors', 'Koji', 'Yokusho', 'Kaori', 'Momoi', 'Chin', 'Tsai', 'Youki', 'Kudo', 'deliver', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'very', 'unusual', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'such', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'very', 'weak', 'leading', 'cast', 'However', 'are', 'saving', 'grace', 'movie', 'keep', 'movie', 'interesting.Cinematography-wise', 'straight', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'jumping', 'out', 'painting', 'movie', 'also', 'featured', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'John', 'Williams', 'great', 'performers', 'including', 'Yo', 'Yo', 'Ma', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'are', 'also', 'important', 'major', 'surviving', 'elements', 'mediocre', 'production', 'such.Lastly', 'narration', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'substance', 'movie', 'so', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'cut', 'out', 'most', 'time', 'especially', 'ending', 'narration', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'made', 'movie', 'look', 'even', 'more', 'pretentious', 'unnecessary']",N/A
169219,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1404983082,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 16]","First of all, I must say that I am a Japanese who can point out many incorrect things about the descriptions of Japan in the early Showa Period (1930s-40s). But I won't do it because I am well aware that `Memoirs of a Geisha' is a fantasy, not a documentary. By now, I believe, most viewers know that the heroine Sayuri/Chiyo is played by Zhang Ziyi who is not Japanese, but Chinese, but let's not talk about it now. I know the film companies in Hollywood thought they need not only a talent but a `name,' and Zhang Ziyi certainly has both. But a bigger problem is still there, and that is the language, English. And you can still find the biggest problem, and that is the soap-opera-ish story that goes on and on.If I refer to the film (set in Japan) as `soap opera,' I would be justified because the story goes like this. Chiyo and her sister are `sold' to `okiya' where geishas live because their parents have no money. Chiyo grows up to be a beautiful geisha `Sayuri' herself after she decided to meet again a kind gentleman `The Chairman' (Ken Watanabe) and she says, she wants to `be his.' They do meet again, but there are so many obstacles, like bullying from and rivalry with the older geisha Hatsumomo (Gong Li). And there is a war. And there is a womanizing `Baron'. And there is ... Well, I haven't read the book of Arthur Golden, but I think that is not this melodramatic.And the film at one time tries to correct the wrong image about geisha, who is sometime regarded as a courtesan. At least, that's what I heard in the interview with Rob Marshall (`Chicago'). But some (including me) would say that the film is rather trying to reinforce that wrong image with the heroine who does not seem to resist to the idea about sleeping with the `highest bidder.' What does he really want to present with Sayuri after all?There are, however, some good points about the long and winding story and one-dimensional characters. The sisterly chemistry between Sayuri and Mameha (Michelle Yeoh) who takes young Sayuri under her wing gives some light and refreshing moments. Yeoh is always associated with action films (who once stole scenes from Jackie Chan in `Police Story 3') and showed a great martial arts fight with Zhan Ziyi in `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.' But her acting here proves that she can not only punch and kick (and fly), but also act.Another merit of the film is its beautiful images by Dion Beebe (`Chicago') and costumes with many kimono clothes. The geishas' town `Hanamachi' (literally, `Flower Town'), possibly made Gion District, Kyoto in mind, looks Japanese enough, and Rob Marshal can take the credit of recreating the inside of the Japanese houses, including furniture and other things, near perfect. (But I'm a connoisseur, you know.) It can be said, to be fair, that they did researches. For example, the sumo champion of the film is played by the real ex-professional sumo wrestler Mainoumi, and the scene of the sumo bout is credible. (But, of course, as to other things, not everything is perfect, but as I promised, I won't complain.)Though the loud music of John Williams comes with too much of Oriental taste, the solo part of Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Pearlman reminds you of the fact that good music is always good, no matter what instrument you might use.But the film has many flaws, and they are all big ones. The greatest problem is, as I said, its language. Except for the opening (where you can see Mako briefly), the characters all speak in English. In this kind of film, you must ignore the accents of the players, but in `Memoirs of a Geisha' it is too obvious that the actors find it too much to speak not in their languages, and consequently the acting looks too restrained. Koji Yakusho (original `Shall We Dance') is an excellent actor, and so is Zhang Ziyi, but here they are often seen struggling to speak the dialogues which themselves are not very memorable. Ken Watanabe fares better, and so do Yuki Kudo and Michelle Yeoh, but in the case of Gong Li the language is doing great harm to her otherwise strong (but slightly over-) acting. But the biggest disaster is the fact that the use of English deprived the ritualistic universe of geisha of its myth and mystery. Geisha-san must speak (and act) with elegance. The geisha of this film certainly acts elegantly, but speaks rather horribly.[ZHANG ZIYI and GONG LI] Now I said what I want to say, except this. Zhang Ziyi is not bad, and probably she will be nominated in the award races this winter (though her acting is most impressive during the non-verbal sequences). Anyway, it is a pity (and irony perhaps) that though Zhang Ziyi may be the most famous face in this film, `Memoirs' is also the debut film in Hollywood for the respected actress Gong Li (The end credit of the film may be misleading.) As many film fans know, she has shown great acting in many of Chinese masterpieces such as `A Terracotta Warrior' and `Raise the Red Lantern,' and I can say you have not seen the real Gong Li unless you see these past films of her. She is much better actress than is suggested by the supporting role of this film.So, is `Memoirs of a Geisha' good? It surely looks beautiful, but please don't expect to see the real universe of geisha, or Japan and its culture. As I said before, it is all fantasy. But probably you've already known that too.(Oh, and here's trivia. The film's title is changed to `Sayuri' in Japan probably because the distributors thought the word `geisha' might suggest a stereotyped image of Japan. Well, but I don't know.)",3,Soap Opera in Kyoto: Beautiful Kimono Cannot Hide Its Hollow Content,1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,5551,"['First', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'Japanese', 'who', 'can', 'point',

That's not to say that the book wasn't spectacular, it did in fact make me excited and interested in watching the movie.Unfortunately, the movie just didn't work for me. Yes, the acting was great, the cinematography was good, the costumes were pretty, the music was stunning, etc. That's about it. The bottom line is that there was no emotion. I give the actresses credit for taking on English speaking roles (for some it was their first!), but it made their acting and their dialogue seem very stilted and forced. All the emotion and heart that could, and should, have been there just didn't seem present throughout the movie. In a sense, the more you got to know the character(s) in the movie, the more detached you felt. I don't think it's the actors fault. I think that the movie focused too much on the costumes, makeup, set designs, in other words, just making the film look pretty.

I can appreciate the criticisms of those who find their performances a bit underwhelming. In contrast, though, I thought the restraint shown by these capable young stars helped to support the theme of emotional repression that was so central to this beautiful movie.

Both are just stunningly lovely women.I'd like to add that my wife and I went to see this film together and were rewarded with what amounted to a private showing--my guess is that most of the people who had planned to see this film in our area had already seen it, and we were probably the last.  No matter.  This one is a contender for the Oscars, if mainly for the visuals.  Yes, the acting leaves something to be desired--I only connected with the emotions of a few scenes (e.g. Chiyo's first encounter with the Chairman [and Suzuka Ohgo has great potential and is utterly charming when she smiles], the big fight between Sayuri and Hatsumomo)--but there are few directors alive today who can capture true Oriental feeling from their actors (the late Akira Kurosawa was one, may he rest in peace).

I was rather surprised that she was willing to settle for a supporting role next to Zhang Ziyi, who gets nicknamed ""Gong Li Jr."" After viewing this film, I understand why she's perfect to be cast as the vindictive and catty Diva Geisha named Hatsumono. It was reported that Li was so impressive in this movie, that she was hired instantly for leads in Miami Vice and the prequel of Silence of the Lambs. Although Zhang Ziyi is the lead, and that she thinks she's going to get an Oscar nomination, I think Li is the one that will be on the best supporting actress cateogory come January, and Michelle Yeoh has a shot at it too, since she gave her most feminine performance to date. There's been a lot of gossip about the casting of three Chinese actresses as the leads. I can understand that it may not be appropiate or convincing, especially they don't look Japanese and the accent is not right. I wonder if Lucy Liu could have been a better choice to play Sayuri, since she would have no problem delivering lines in fluent English with a Japanese accent. Or better yet, they could hire Meryl Streep to coach the three actresses a thing or two about accents. The bottom line is Zhang Ziyi has bankability, and she's the ""It Girl"", despite the fact she's also the most disliked, overrated, overused, and overexposed actress from all of Asia.Memoirs of a Geisha is the story of a lengendary geisha named Sayuri. It chronicles the days when she was sold to become a maid in the geisha house at the age of nine, to becoming the most famous geisha after enduring a great deal of hardship and pain. Her only sister was sold to the ""Pleasure District"", and never reconnected when she ran away. Her fisherman father and mother died of poor health. The broken hearted Chiyo decides to become a geisha, and she was fortunate enough to have Mammeha(Michelle Yeoh) as her mentor, and from then she changed her name to Sayuri. In her early days as a maid, she had been treated badly by the nasty and cruel Hatsumono(Gong Li), and in order to retaliate, she must become a great geisha. Hatsumono and Mammeha are rivals, and Mammeha intended to use Sayuri to maintain her status and power in the geisha world, and of course to upstage Hatsumono one day.Hatsumono is a rebellious geisha, and she secretly has forbidden sexual and romantic encounters. The increasingly successful Sayuri provokes her to the point of verbal and physical attacks. Her plans to sabotage Sayuri's career eventually fails and she loses her status as the top geisha. Gong Li had several mesmerizing moments, such as the one when Mother(played by the scene stealing Kaori Momoi) confronted her for violating the rules of forbidden love. Also her final showdown with Zhang Ziyi when she set the house on fire was totally Oscar-calibre stuff! At first, I found that Li's accent is very off, but I just ignored it since her performance was so striking.Michelle Yeoh gets to tackle a role that's totally anti-action chick. Mammeha is a wise senior geisha who is kind to Sayuri, but she can be ruthless and aggressive at times. Yeoh excells in conveying the femininity and sophisticated aspects of a geisha. Compare to the role Hatsumono, Mammeha is kind of subdued and less powerful. She still gets the same amount of screentime as Li, and she obviously has no problem speaking English fluently.The Japanese actors all have supporting roles. Youki Kudoh(Pumkin) is a bit of a comic relief. Her role is ""dumb geisha""who became very ""Americanized during the World War 2. Ken Watanabe is rather underexposed as Chairman, the love interest of Sayuri. I find that the development of their romance is not convincing, and it was disappointing that their love scene was deleted. Suzuka Ohgo who played Chiyo is quite impressive, and she appeared in the first half an hour of the film. Tsai Chin who was memorable in The Joy Luck Club plays the dutiful housekeeping Auntie, and she had a few strong scenes to work with.Zhang Ziyi's performance just came across as monotone, unlike the intense and subtle Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. The only time she's amazing is when she does the dance numbers. She's good at making herself look like an amateur when she's playing scenes with other veteran actors. For instance, the scene when she almost got raped, or did she?, she was not convincing at all. I really don't understand why Rob Marshall thought she was the most suitable actress to play Sayuri? I agree with one critic who considered her performance like watching an ESL play.I am sure this film is most likely going to get the following Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress(Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh, Kaori Momoi), Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, and Best Cinematography. By the way, it just occured to me that Julie Taymor(Titus, Frida) could have been a better choice to direct this film. She's better as a visionary and dramatic director than Marshall.",4,Gong Li Steals the Show!,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,5187,"['Gong', 'Li', 'been', 'most', 'internationally', 'acclaimed',

Those criticisms seem empty in themselves. Were we ever supposed to feel for Sayuri? He life as a Geisha was not one that allowed free flowing emotions nor did it allow Sayuri to become The Chairman's true wife while keeping her identity as a Geisha. Perhaps the intent of this film was to deprive the viewer our relationship with the main character just as she was deprived intimacy all those years. The Geisha world itself it disjointed from reality, focusing on the mysterious karykai (the flower and the willow world) with the willow serving as a reference to the strength and resillience of the Geisha.This movie was well worth the time and was a very nice insight into Japanese culture.

When I hear the book was being turned into a movie I waited with baited breath for its release. And I wasn't disappointed.The movie sticks to the script of the book fantastically. The acting is superb and the sets were a picture perfect portrayal of what I had in my minds eye when I read the book.The story is of a peasant girl sold by her parents to a geisha house in Gion. There she is beaten and brutalized by the Madam of the house and the head geisha Hatsumomo. Her true beauty is recognized by Hatsumomo's rival, Mameha, who takes Chiyo under her wing and turns her into a renowned geisha known as Sayuri.This film is a love-story in one sense and a story of survival and hardship in another. I felt like I was back reading the book and enjoyed every second. Some have criticized the film because the actors weren't Japanese but I don't think this takes away from the film at all.

One comment I keep hearing is that the actresses did not perform well, and I cannot comprehend it. Ziyi Zhang especially gave one of the best performances I have seen in years, at least. Just look at her physically shaking during her last scene with Ken Watanabe. This complete giving over to the emotion of the character is nearly unsurpassed in anything I've seen in years, and I'm a huge cinemaphile. That's not to mention the flawless way she carried the postures and demeanor of the child star that played her young self through-out, giving a sense of consistency that I have almost never seen done this well. It's early impossible to remember that these two actresses are not really the same person with the way their performances meshed. So, maybe it's the reserved nature of Asian women, and the dualing of this nature with a sense of individuality and self-expression that people are interpreting as ""not understanding the character""?All I can say is, the cinematography and settings are gorgeous, as are the actresses (and what a stellar cast!), the performances are great (maybe the bar has been lowered so much lately that the degree of skill brought to the screen here is more than some people can handle). That's the only reason I can offer for the bad reactions I have heard.The story is involving, and very realistic in terms of human nature. The romance is wonderful. There are flashes of humor and some of the script is pure poetry (and as a poet you can believe me on that!) I could go on all day, but let me just say this.The movie is awesome, and the time flew by for me. It is not the over-wrought heart-rending sap that some may want it to be, but it is very true to the way most people behave, and especially in the reserved manner of the Japanese.
