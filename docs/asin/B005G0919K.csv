1459681,A2K5IXQT6RNX34,B005G0919K,Christina Paige,"[0, 0]","This breathtakingly lovely film from Studio Ghibli is a masterpiece. Based on the The Borrowers series of children's books by Mary Norton, it is the story of a family of tiny people who live in the behind and underneath places of an old house. They call themselves ""Borrowers"" and they pick up the dropped and discarded things that go missing -  a phenomenon familiar to householders - and put them to extremely clever, inventive uses. I loved the earrings used as grappling hooks, the stamps as artwork, and a round head pin that makes a very effective sword for the young heroine.Arrietty and her parents, Pod and Homily, are the only Borrowers left in a house that used to be the home of many. Arrietty is just old enough to go on her first official Borrow - their sugar bowl is empty - and Homily requests a sheet of Kleenex too. For years the only human around has been a caretaker named Haru, but a boy has arrived, Sho, who is weakened by a heart condition that could kill him at any moment. His mother has sent him to the old family house for rest. Sho is weak, but observant, and he spies young Arrietty as she navigates the garden on a quest to bring home a bay laurel lead and some mint. Arrietty is terrified that having been seen will jeopardize her status as an active Borrower, but over time Sho proves a true friend. Haru, however, becomes suspicious and sets out to trap the minikins whose existence she has long suspected.  Pod and Homily must make the tough call: stay in danger or risk danger to find a new home where other Borrowers may be.The charm of this movie is threefold: first, the tenderness between Sho and the adventuresome Arrietty: there is a love story here, the kind where love proves stronger than fear or difference, and strengthens the ones who love; second, the details of the lives of the Borrowers as they negotiate an outsize world, liberating cubes of sugar and trekking through dense jungles of grass and shrubbery; and third, the gorgeousness of the garden and other backgrounds, including a dollhouse that was lovingly crafted by Sho's grandfather and young mother for the little people they had once glimpsed. Any child - or adult - who has ever hunkered down to look closely at the world of roots and bugs and the close construction of things will love this movie. Both my 16 year old daughter and my 8 year old son were rapt.A few hardcore adrenaline junkies who opine that Cars 2 was the ne plus ultra of film-making may be inured to the enchantment of The Secret World of Arrietty, but I'll nominate it for 2012's Animation Oscar over anything Pixar puts forth this year.",5,Studio Ghibli Does it Again,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,2622,"['breathtakingly', 'lovely', 'film', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'masterpiece', 'Based', 'Borrowers', 'series', 'children', 'books', 'Mary', 'Norton', 'story', 'family', 'tiny', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'behind', 'underneath', 'places', 'old', 'house', 'call', 'Borrowers', 'pick', 'up', 'dropped', 'discarded', 'things', 'go', 'missing', 'phenomenon', 'familiar', 'householders', 'put', 'extremely', 'clever', 'inventive', 'uses', 'loved', 'earrings', 'used', 'grappling', 'hooks', 'stamps', 'artwork', 'round', 'head', 'pin', 'very', 'effective', 'sword', 'young', 'heroine.Arrietty', 'parents', 'Pod', 'Homily', 'are', 'only', 'Borrowers', 'left', 'house', 'used', 'be', 'home', 'many', 'Arrietty', 'just', 'old', 'enough', 'go', 'first', 'official', 'Borrow', 'sugar', 'bowl', 'empty', 'Homily', 'sheet', 'Kleenex', 'too', 'years', 'only', 'human', 'around', 'been', 'caretaker', 'named', 'Haru', 'boy', 'arrived', 'Sho', 'who', 'weakened', 'heart', 'condition', 'could', 'kill', 'moment', 'mother', 'sent', 'old', 'family', 'house', 'rest', 'Sho', 'weak', 'observant', 'young', 'Arrietty', 'garden', 'quest', 'bring', 'home', 'bay', 'laurel', 'lead', 'mint', 'Arrietty', 'terrified', 'having', 'been', 'seen', 'will', 'jeopardize', 'status', 'active', 'Borrower', 'time', 'Sho', 'true', 'friend', 'Haru', 'however', 'suspicious', 'out', 'trap', 'minikins', 'existence', 'long', 'suspected', 'Pod', 'Homily', 'must', 'make', 'tough', 'call', 'stay', 'danger', 'risk', 'danger', 'find', 'new', 'home', 'where', 'other', 'Borrowers', 'may', 'be.The', 'charm', 'movie', 'threefold', 'first', 'tenderness', 'Sho', 'adventuresome', 'Arrietty', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'kind', 'where', 'love', 'stronger', 'fear', 'difference', 'ones', 'who', 'love', 'second', 'details', 'lives', 'Borrowers', 'negotiate', 'outsize', 'world', 'liberating', 'cubes', 'sugar', 'trekking', 'dense', 'jungles', 'grass', 'shrubbery', 'third', 'gorgeousness', 'garden', 'other', 'backgrounds', 'including', 'dollhouse', 'was', 'lovingly', 'crafted', 'Sho', 'grandfather', 'young', 'mother', 'little', 'people', 'had', 'once', 'glimpsed', 'child', 'adult', 'who', 'ever', 'hunkered', 'down', 'look', 'closely', 'world', 'roots', 'bugs', 'close', 'construction', 'things', 'will', 'love', 'movie', '16', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'were', 'rapt.A', 'few', 'hardcore', 'adrenaline', 'junkies', 'who', 'opine', 'Cars', '2', 'was', 'ne', 'ultra', 'film-making', 'may', 'be', 'inured', 'enchantment', 'Secret', 'World', 'Arrietty', ""'ll"", 'nominate', '2012', 'Animation', 'Oscar', 'anything', 'Pixar', 'forth', 'year']","Studio Ghibli: The Borrower Arrietty DVD (Licensed boxed version, Japanese audio version with Eng Sub)"

1459691,A2GP36FGLXD9T2,B005G0919K,Oscar L. Colombo,"[3, 4]","As a child, I used to spend hours outdoors, in the garden of our house or in the fields. And, in the lazy summer afternoons, during school vacation, I did daydream of many adventures where I was the great and fearless hero. A favorite one was imagining that I was small enough to walk under the blades of grass and the weeds around me, scramble over roots and climb up vines, and fight to the death with monstrous denizens of the underbrush: lizards, toads. Or fly through the air on the back of a bumble bee or a dragonfly.These are common fancies of childhood: many have them. We grow up, and largely forget about them, unless our own children remind us, if they feel like sharing with us, grownups, their secret dreams.""The Borrower Arrietty"" is about those same wide awake dreams: it is a children's movie (11 -14 years' old) for imaginative children, and it is a nostalgic evocation of childhood for those who were once so.The animation, drawing and the colors are a joy to watch: technically and artistically, this is Studio Ghibli at its best. It is also rendered in their classic ""clear line"" style that is so good here it leaves CGI-heavy 3-D movies in the dust.I have been lucky to see this movie before its theatrical release in the USA, in this excellent DVD copy. No English dubbing, but very good and unobtrusive white subtitles easy to read without being distracted from the action. Excellent sounding Japanese track, with music that underscores well the mood of the scenes.This is a story of two worlds: those of a family of normal size people living in one big house, and of a family of tiny people living in the crawl space below. The small people live quietly, trying hard not to be noticed, because they have the hard-earned knowledge that, for them, being discovered is most dangerous. They ""borrow"" small items that make their lives easier or even possible: a sugar cube, that will last them months, a sharp pin, to use as a defensive weapon to fight with, or scare away predatory vermin, murderous cats, or attacking crows.One night, young Arrietty, the pretty thumb-sized daughter of the small couple, goes out with her father in her very first ""borrowing"" expedition. That will lead to her being discovered by a normal size boy who is staying in the house ""upstairs"", and to the adventures that follow.The whole sequence of the trip by father and daughter from their neat tiny house, disguised under bricks and rubble, to the boy's bedroom, where they are going to ""borrow"" some tissue paper, is outstandingly imaginative. As are, later on, several outdoor episodes.The characters, both of normal size and tiny, are ordinary people trying to get on with their lives as best they can and know how. In some respects, the movie resembles the early Hayao Miyazaki's work in ""Totoro"" and ""Kiki"". There are moments of suspense or frantic action, punctuated with quiet, meditative ones, where the surface of things is lovingly portrayed while, somehow, the mysterious in them is hinted at. This is one of Ghibli's specialties: ""pillow"" scenes where the eye and the mind can rest on the first drops of rain marking dark circles on a stone, that gradually grow and overlap as the surface goes from dry to soaking wet. (Miyazaki wrote but did not direct this movie: that task was given to the youngest of Ghibli's animators, Hiromasa Yonebayashi.)This movie differs in several important aspects from the original children's book by the late British author Mary Norton. That is not a criticism, because this is obviously a loose adaptation of the original written tale, one that takes into account the different nature of the cinema as an artistic medium, which is as it should be.In fact, the main problem with this otherwise delightful movie, is that the script does not follow the original story loosely enough. That limits the movie to only a few characters. These are just ordinary folks, nice or otherwise, but not extremely interesting in themselves, the small people living in self-sufficient isolation, making hardly any contact with others. They are not sure if there are still others like them: they are, perhaps, the very last of their kind. And they live avoiding any contacts with their normal size, and only, neighbors as much as possible.""Kiki"" is, in some respects, the closest previous Ghibli movie where the main characters are also ordinary people: Kiki was a witch, yes, but also just a girl trying to make a living with the one special skill she had: she could fly on a broom, so she set up a delivery service. However, she was a beginner in a large, colorful and exciting city, and her trade brought her in contact with a variety of unusual people in amusing or scary situations. In ""Arrietty"" there are only five principal characters, plus three or four others that show up occasionally and briefly. Also, leaving aside the unusual size of four of them, there are no magical beings, as in ""Totoro"" or ""Pom Poko"".Perhaps because of the limitations of the story, the creators of this movie do not offer much by way of character development. Instead, they have chosen to give those of us who once daydreamed of adventures in the small world under the summer grass, a nostalgic occasion to revisit those dreams. And they have given our children the stuff of those old dreams to spin with it their own in their own secret world.",4,"Out of the daydreams of chilhood, a little work of art.",1327708800,"01 28,

We are both ardent fans of stories featuring little people and have watched the classic animated cartoon series from the 80s, The Littles: The Complete Unedited Series, as well as read the books by Mary Norton which inspired Arietty, i.e. The Complete Adventures of the Borrowers. We also love many of Studio Ghibli's productions such as My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Ponyo, among others. The hand-drawn animation with its lush colors, and great attention to details is another reason to watch this movie. The animators bring life to the miniature world of the borrowers, and watching the place Arietty and her parents call home is such a joy because of the minute details such as the decorations in Arietty's room; the wonderful, cozy kitchen; the paraphernalia carried around by Arietty and her father as they go exploring; and many more. I could gush on and on, but you get the idea - it is pure whimsy and delightful!The story itself captures the imagination of young and old alike. 14-year-old Arietty Clock belongs to a race of tiny people called The Borrowers (they derive their name from the act of 'borrowing' what is needed from regular human beings or 'beans'). She lives with her quiet but strong and gentle father,Pod and a rather neurotic mother, Homily who is prone to panic attacks (her greatest fear is that her husband will not return home from a borrowing expedition after falling prey to a cat!). Life is pleasing and happy enough for the Clocks, but young Arietty dreams of adventure and of going on her first borrowing expedition. Her adventurous nature results in her being seen by a human boy one day. Shawn is a sickly young boy who has been sent to his aunt's house in the country to rest while he waits to undergo an operation that will hopefully help his heart function better. Sean has heard stories from his mother about the little people, and his sighting of Arietty leads to the beginning of a strange but wondrous friendship between the two, even though their worlds aren't exactly compatible, especially since it places the Borrowers' existence in jeopardy.Like many stories, the plot would not be complete without a villain, played by batty housekeeper, Hara. For most of the film though, the focus is on the daily lives of the Clocks in their miniature world as well as their survival in the greater world, and also on the developing friendship between Arietty and Shawn. It is only in the last 35 minutes or so of the film that the action picks up pace, but everything just falls into place so beautifully, that my daughter and I were sad to see this beautiful animated film come to an end! What a wondrous film that lets one's imagination soar and warm one's heart! This film runs at about 94 minutes, and is rated G (there are some tense scenes when some Borrowers get into peril, but nothing that is overtly scary), and its original Japanese title is Kari-gurashi no Arietti. Final verdict - wonderful family entertainment!",5,A lovely story!,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,3099,"['movie', 'appealed', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'several', 'levels', 'are', 'ardent', 'fans', 'stories', 'featuring', 'little', 'people', 'have', 'watched', 'classic', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'series', '80s', 'Littles', 'Complete', 'Unedited', 'Series', 'as', 'well', 'read', 'books', 'Mary', 'Norton', 'inspired', 'Arietty', 'i.e', 'Complete', 'Adventures', 'Borrowers', 'also', 'love', 'many', 'Studio', 'Ghibli', 'productions', 'such', 'My', 'Neighbor', 'Totoro', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Ponyo', 'others', 'hand-drawn', 'animation', 'lush', 'colors', 'great', 'attention', 'details', 'reason', 'watch', 'movie', 'animators', 'bring', 'life', 'miniature', 'world', 'borrowers', 'watching', 'place', 'Arietty', 'parents', 'call', 'home', 'such', 'joy', 'minute', 'details', 'such', 'decorations', 'Arietty', 'room', 'wonderful', 'cozy', 'kitchen', 'paraphernalia', 'carried', 'Arietty', 'father', 'go', 'exploring', 'many', 'more', 'could', 'gush', 'get', 'idea', 'pure', 'whimsy', 'delightful', 'story', 'imagination', 'young', 'old', 'alike', '14-year-old', 'Arietty', 'Clock', 'race', 'tiny', 'people', 'called', 'Borrowers', 'derive', 'name', 'act', ""'borrowing"", 'what', 'needed', 'regular', 'human', 'beings', ""'beans"", 'quiet', 'strong', 'gentle', 'father', 'Pod', 'rather', 'neurotic', 'mother', 'Homily', 'who', 'prone', 'panic', 'attacks', 'greatest', 'fear', 'husband', 'will', 'not', 'return', 'home', 'borrowing', 'expedition', 'falling', 'prey', 'cat', 'Life', 'pleasing', 'happy', 'enough', 'Clocks', 'young', 'Arietty', 'dreams', 'adventure', 'going', 'first', 'borrowing', 'expedition', 'adventurous', 'nature', 'results', 'being', 'seen', 'human', 'boy', 'one', 'day', 'Shawn', 'sickly', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'sent', 'aunt', 'house', 'country', 'rest', 'undergo', 'operation', 'will', 'hopefully', 'help', 'heart', 'function', 'better', 'Sean', 'heard', 'stories', 'mother', 'little', 'people', 'sighting', 'Arietty', 'beginning', 'strange', 'wondrous', 'friendship', 'two', 'even', 'worlds', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'compatible', 'especially', 'Borrowers', 'existence', 'jeopardy.Like', 'many', 'stories', 'plot', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'villain', 'played', 'batty', 'housekeeper', 'Hara', 'most', 'film', 'focus', 'daily', 'lives', 'Clocks', 'miniature', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'survival', 'greater', 'world', 'also', 'developing', 'friendship', 'Arietty', 'Shawn', 'only', 'last', '35', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'action', 'up', 'pace', 'everything', 'just', 'place', 'so', 'beautifully', 'daughter', 'were', 'sad', 'see', 'beautiful', 'animated', 'film', 'come', 'end', 'What', 'wondrous', 'film', 'one', 'imagination', 'soar', 'warm', 'one', 'heart', 'film', '94', 'minutes', 'rated', 'G', 'are', 'tense', 'scenes', 'when', 'Borrowers', 'get', 'peril', 'nothing', 'overtly', 'scary', 'original', 'Japanese', 'title', 'Kari-gurashi', 'Arietti', 'Final', 'verdict', 'wonderful', 'family', 'entertainment']","Studio Ghibli: The Borrower Arrietty DVD (Licensed boxed version, Japanese audio version with Eng Sub)"
