But as some reviewers have mentioned, some of the music has been changed from the original TV version and this did detract from the movie overall.I did not like the ending either. I can think of an alternative that would have been more satisfying to the viewer.

I recorded it years ago on VHS from TV with the correct soundtrack ""Little Fishies"" song. I got it prerecorded on VHS in the 80's and was disappointed to find the soundtrack had been altered for no apparent reason as described in other reviews. I just ordered this DVD version even though the soundtrack is apparently still altered...it is still a very good David Janssen movie and a classic action film from 70's TV (I believe it was a made for TV movie). Great story line and helicopter chase sequences, the ending is still a heartbreaker (I'll not give it away!). If you've never seen this, it is definitely worth the price and I'm glad I've found it available on DVD. If you've seen it before and don't think you want it with the altered soundtrack, it is still worth the price as it is a great movie...I think at this point the original version is probably lost forever...except for those of us lucky enough to have recorded it off TV and still have our old VHS tapes!",5,Classic 70's action film,1213142400,"06 11, 2008",2008,1050,"['remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'child', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'get', 'tape', 'recorded', 'years', 'ago', 'VHS', 'TV', 'correct', 'soundtrack', 'Little', 'Fishies', 'song', 'got', 'prerecorded', 'VHS', '80', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'soundtrack', 'had', 'been', 'altered', 'apparent', 'reason', 'described', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'version', 'even', 'soundtrack', 'apparently', 'still', 'altered', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'David', 'Janssen', 'movie', 'classic', 'action', 'film', '70', 'TV', 'believe', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'Great', 'story', 'line', 'helicopter', 'chase', 'sequences', 'ending', 'still', 'heartbreaker', ""'ll"", 'not', 'give', 'away', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'definitely', 'worth', 'price', ""'m"", 'glad', ""'ve"", 'found', 'available', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'want', 'altered', 'soundtrack', 'still', 'worth', 'price', 'great', 'movie', 'think', 'point', 'original', 'version', 'probably', 'lost', 'forever', 'lucky', 'enough', 'have', 'recorded', 'off', 'TV', 'still', 'have', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes']",N/A

The substituted &#34;musical score&#34; is just a bunch of cheap, &#34;WWII-era-sounding&#34; mishmash playing in the background, making this otherwise fine film into a cheap, clownish production. There are at least two or perhaps three scenes wherein Harry (Janssen) is flying along and his lips are flopping up and down rapidly like a fish out of water but the appropriate music isn't playing - an extremely amateurish attempt to substitute what should have been the original musical score (&#34;Little Bitty Fishies&#34;, if my memory serves me right...) with some garbage consisting of a &#34;generic&#34; WWII-era musical score and NO lyrics at all! There are also a few scenes that have been &#34;clipped&#34; a wee bit when compared to the original. My opinion? DON'T buy this movie - either in VHS or DVD format - UNTIL someone agrees to re-do this film as the original film, complete with the original musical score.
