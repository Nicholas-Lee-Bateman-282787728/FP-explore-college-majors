Everything he did turned to gold. And back then, this was gold. Samuel L. Jackson was unknown in the eighties even though he was earning his living out of acting in Hollywood films. At the beginning of this movie he plays the father of Eddie Murphy whose raw, cutting edge humor raises eyebrows and complete silence amongst his family.I have watched ""Raw"" many times and found it very funny to a point. The last 25 minutes are kind of dull, and not much, if any laughs but it's pretty much a laugh riot up until the last 25 minutes or so.  The funniest parts include the Bill Cosby, and Richard Pryor imitations, and the part about Eddie wanting a McDonald's hamburger as a kid. Even when it loses its momentum toward the end, I still watch this disc just for that.",4,This has a some memorable moments,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,851,"['Murphy', 'was', 'best', 'was', 'era', 'where', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'guy', 'Everything', 'did', 'turned', 'gold', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'gold', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'was', 'unknown', 'eighties', 'even', 'was', 'earning', 'living', 'acting', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'beginning', 'movie', 'father', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'raw', 'cutting', 'edge', 'humor', 'eyebrows', 'complete', 'silence', 'amongst', 'family.I', 'have', 'watched', 'Raw', 'many', 'times', 'found', 'very', 'funny', 'point', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'are', 'kind', 'dull', 'not', 'much', 'laughs', 'pretty', 'much', 'laugh', 'riot', 'up', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'funniest', 'parts', 'include', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'imitations', 'part', 'Eddie', 'wanting', 'McDonald', 'hamburger', 'kid', 'Even', 'when', 'momentum', 'end', 'still', 'watch', 'disc', 'just']",N/A

Again,Murphy impersonates more popular entertainers,this time those being the late great Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby. My favorite part of this show was the Pryor/Cosby impersonations. Murphy claims,although they never met face-to-face,that Cosby chastised him on the phone for his highly profane comedy. Murphy has been a longtime fan of Cosby's and of course always watched Cosby's (in '87)#1 NBC sitcom THE COSBY SHOW. Pryor influenced Murphy and in fact Pryor himself followed in Cosby's footsteps in the sixties. Pryor and Murphy would later star together in another Paramount property,HARLEM NIGHTS. Between DELIRIOUS and this show,Murphy did more popular films like BEVERLY HILLS COP 1 and 2(also Paramount properties),THE GOLDEN CHILD(another Paramount property), and BEST DEFENSE with the late Dudley Moore(another Paramount property,wow!). I also loved Murphy's impersonations of non-celebrity foreigners(""I see you on tellehvesion,you're the 'f--k yuh' mon,right?"").

It starts off with a good natured Thansksgiving sketch that had a very animal joke, but nothing can really top that.

241980,A21T2ZAT0QA0KO,6300989011,ChildInside,"[0, 1]","I swear to everybody reading this movie, I have never seen another comedian even half as hilarious as Eddie Murphy nor even a quarter as truthful.I remember that before I really got into stand-up comedy, the only person I ever watched was Chris Rock and Robert Schimmel (the first stand-up comedian I ever saw). Needless to say, my knowledge was limited. However, after hearing the horrendous performance Rock gave on 'Never Scared', I decided to broaden my horizons.So first, I was led to the Kings of Comedy video, which I found stunningly horrible. After that, I was told some really good things about Richard Pryor, so I watched what many said to be his best video and I thought it was great. Then I heard about Eddie Murphy. At the time, I was a fan of Murphy, but I had a hard time imagining him as a comedian. I was more used to seeing him in comedy movies. However, I decided to take the risk anyway and watched 'Eddie Murphy Raw'.I thank God that I did take that risk today.Simply put, Eddie Murphy is nearly perfect! I had once thought that Chris Rock's Bring The Pain was the best stand-up performance ever, but Eddie Murphy proved me wrong. I definitely liked Raw better than Bring The Pain.What's so good about it? Simply put, Eddie Murphy is THE BEST impersonator I've ever seen, thus his impersonations are simply amazing! Secondly, he say a lot of true things, especially about women. Most people are afraid to make fun of women, but thankfully, Murphy wasn't. Really, anyone who can not relate to the things Eddie Murphy says about women must be extremely sheltered or feminists. Simple as that. I'm relatively young and even I know what Murphy is talking about through the video!A lot of people seemed to view it as 'bitter' or 'misogynist', but I can hardly call Raw either of those, especially since Murphy has this huge smile all throughout the video. Also, while Eddie talks a lot about how manipulative women are and etc, why does no one mention the fact that Eddie Murphy basically called all men adulterers? It's funny how the critics say he's misogynistic for a few remarks, but fail to mention the misandric remarks he say. To make it simple, Eddie Murphy is not misogynistic or misandric! He's simply a comedian trying to make people laugh and relate to him. Hopefully, critics will have that stick out of their behinds when they start watching other comedy performances.Anyway, if you're thinking of viewing Eddie Murphy Raw, there are generally MUST SEE parts. That being the beginning where he impersonates Bill Cosby, the middle where he talks about the way moms cook, and the end where he recalls a phone call with his father. Don't get me wrong, the rest is really good too, but those are the MUST SEE.Also, if you're wondering why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars. One of the reason is because of the cameraman in the video. I don't know what the hell was he smoking, but he frequently focused on the wrong area. For example, during one of the scenes where Eddie Murphy talks about songs, the cameraman focused on everywhere EXCEPT his face. Why the hell did he do that? And he does thing like this throughout the whole video? What, did focusing on Murphy's face embarrass him? Geez!Another problem is that while Raw is very good, I still can't help but feel Delirious was superior. Not necessarily because there's better material, but because he does a lot more impressive impersonations in Delirious. Ultimately, get both; they're both GREAT!",4,"I don't give a damn what anybody says, Eddie Murphy is KING!",1135382400,"12 24, 2005",2005,3483,"['swear', 'everybody', 'reading', 'movie', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'comedian', 'even', 'half', 'as', 'hilarious', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'even', 'quarter', 'truthful.I', 'remember', 'really', 'got', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'watched', 'was', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Robert', 'Schimmel', 'first', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'ever', 'saw', 'Needless', 'say', 'knowledge', 'was', 'limited', 'However', 'hearing', 'horrendous', 'performance', 'Rock', 'gave', ""'Never"", 'Scared', 'decided', 'broaden', 'horizons.So', 'first', 'was', 'led', 'Kings', 'Comedy', 'video', 'found', 'stunningly', 'horrible', 'was', 'told', 'really', 'good', 'things', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'watched', 'what', 'many', 'said', 'be', 'best', 'video', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'Then', 'heard', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'time', 'was', 'fan', 'Murphy', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'imagining', 'comedian', 'was', 'more', 'used', 'seeing', 'comedy', 'movies', 'However', 'decided', 'take', 'risk', 'anyway', 'watched', ""'Eddie"", 'Murphy', ""Raw'.I"", 'thank', 'God', 'did', 'take', 'risk', 'today.Simply', 'put', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'had', 'once', 'thought', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Bring', 'Pain', 'was', 'best', 'stand-up', 'performance', 'ever', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'proved', 'wrong', 'definitely', 'liked', 'Raw', 'better', 'Bring', 'Pain.What', 'so', 'good', 'Simply', 'put', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'THE', 'BEST', 'impersonator', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'thus', 'impersonations', 'are', 'simply', 'amazing', 'Secondly', 'say', 'lot', 'true', 'things', 'especially', 'women', 'Most', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'make', 'fun', 'women', 'thankfully', 'Murphy', 'was', ""n't"", 'Really', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'things', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'women', 'must', 'be', 'extremely', 'sheltered', 'feminists', 'Simple', ""'m"", 'relatively', 'young', 'even', 'know', 'what', 'Murphy', 'talking', 'video', 'lot', 'people', 'seemed', 'view', ""'bitter"", 'can', 'hardly', 'call', 'Raw', 'either', 'especially', 'Murphy', 'huge', 'smile', 'video', 'Also', 'Eddie', 'lot', 'how', 'manipulative', 'women', 'are', 'etc', 'why', 'one', 'mention', 'fact', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'basically', 'called', 'men', 'adulterers', 'funny', 'how', 'critics', 'say', 'misogynistic', 'few', 'remarks', 'fail', 'mention', 'misandric', 'remarks', 'say', 'make', 'simple', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'not', 'misogynistic', 'misandric', 'simply', 'comedian', 'trying', 'make', 'people', 'relate', 'Hopefully', 'critics', 'will', 'have', 'behinds', 'when', 'start', 'watching', 'other', 'comedy', 'performances.Anyway', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'viewing', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'Raw', 'are', 'generally', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'parts', 'being', 'beginning', 'where', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'middle', 'where', 'way', 'moms', 'cook', 'end', 'where', 'phone', 'call', 'father', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'rest', 'really', 'good', 'too', 'are', 'MUST', 'SEE.Also', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'One', 'reason', 'cameraman', 'video', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'smoking', 'frequently', 'focused', 'wrong', 'area', 'example', 'one', 'scenes', 'where', 'Eddie', 'Murphy', 'talks', 'songs', 'cameraman', 'focused', 'everywhere', 'face', 'Why', 'hell', 'did', 'do', 'thing', 'whole', 'video', 'What', 'did', 'focusing', 'Murphy', 'face', 'embarrass', 'Geez', 'problem', 'Raw', 'very', 'good', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'Delirious', 'was', 'superior', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'material', 'lot', 'more', 'impressive', 'impersonations', 'Delirious', 'Ultimately', 'get', ""'re"", 'GREAT']",N/A

They do.  Eddie seems to be beating a dead horse in this routine.  If I had gone to the show, I would have felt cheated.

If you were laughing at the jokes from &quot;Delirious&quot;, then chances are that you were rolling on floor in laughter when you watched this.Before the performance is a Keenan Ivory Wayans-produced sketch where it shows Eddie as a kid (played by Deion Richmond [Kenny on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;]) telling a nasty joke in front of his family, which sets the tone of what his act will be: funny but in bad taste. If you look closer, his family members consist of other people who weren't famous yet like Tatyana Ali (&quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;) and Samuel L. Jackson.Now, on to the act (directed by Robert Townsend, I might add). Though he does less impressions of stars than he did in &quot;Delirious&quot;, it is still hilarious to see him do a fed-up Michael Jackson, a scolding Bill Cosby, and a dead-on impression of Richard Pryor, his idol. The audience is noticeably having a good time and even catches Eddie cracking himself up when he talks about getting arrested by a certain type of police.In this day and age when African-American comedians' whole routine is usually about how black folks are different from white folks, you wonder if they ever studied Eddie Murphy's monologues, because Murphy had a LOT more to speak on. See the discussion on prenuptial agreement: if you (the man) don't get one with your wife, when it's time for your divorce, she'll ask for &quot;HALF!&quot; of your money. Of course that comes off as misogynistic and derogatory, but it's just comedy, not necessarily commentary.You'll bust a gut laughing at Oomfufu, Eddie's pretend wife; his mama's hamburger that's &quot;better than McDonald's&quot;; and his reenactment of a fight that happened in a club. His funniest jokes, however, revolve around how the audience members' reactions might be: for example, when he suggests that women would rather be alone with her man instead of seeing this show, a woman would say, &quot;That's true! [Eddie's] funny, but he ain't that funny!&quot;I knocked off a half-a-star because the bit about his drunk father, first introduced in &quot;Delirious&quot;, ran too long.

You cant really compare Eddie Murphy to Richard Pryor or any of the other great comedians before him because he basically tells you that he loves them and he wanted to be on their level. Some people criticize Raw as if Eddie Murphy is bragging about being the greatest comedian ever and no other will ever be as good as him and that's not what this standup is about at all. Eddie's childhood stands out most and you even hear stories of times him and Charlie had to go through.I can relate with his mom making those ghetto burgers instead of taking him to McDonalds like he wanted and I'm sure I'm not the only one with those memories. How can you not love the stories of his tipsy father who told his wife she was on punishment and wasn't allowed to go outside or how he had a lego dinner one night. Sure Raw can be controversial at times but what comedian isn't so don't watch this if you have virgin ears. At the very beginning you get a treat to see upcoming stars you'll recognize play a young Eddie and his family at a get-together. It shows how he started on his trip to being a comedian.I'm sure Delirious is hilarious and I haven't had the pleasure of seeing it since it's not on DVD but I'm sure Eddie isn't trying to compete against himself because it's entertainment so you can enjoy it. When watching Raw try to enjoy it and not waste time by comparing everything or trying to figure out what's better. That's probably a huge reason why some people didn't like because they did everything except watch the show.

I was about nine years old at the time an' I have NEVER, not before or since, laughed so damn hard in my life, to the point where I was LITERALLY rollin' on the floor, hardly able to breathe.  This is definitely one'a the best concert films EVER, an' anyone who won't give it that is jus' hatin'.  Murphy outdid himself here, goin' an hour-and-a-half jus' him an' the audience, keepin' the pace goin', never runnin' jokes into the ground, an' sayin' some pretty offensive stuff.  Over the years, Murphy gained this reputation as one'a the most egocentric, misogynistic, an' vulgar comedians on the scene ('till 'bout the late '90s, 'Adventures of Pluto Nash' anyone?).  But, at the same time, he was still a likeable an' I guess charming kind'a guy.  I mean, c'mon, whas' not to like about a guy who talks about contaminating the wholesome minds'a the Cosby kids, or carves out the most stereotypical African-tribal jungle bunny as his wife, or how 'bout his description'a that sound a woman makes when you know you've got her sprung.  Oh, an' don't even get me started on his impression of the only dance that white people can do.  That is one'a THE funniest things I've EVER seen.'Raw' is without a doubt one'a my all-time favorites, but, honestly, I'm really giving it four-and-a-half stars.  Why?  Well, as hilarious an' wonderfully offensive as it is, it ain't NEARLY as raw an' jaw-droppingly funny as 'Delirious', which was his REAL peak on the stand-up circuit, if you ask me.

He did more celebrity impressions and even created exaggerated performances of his own family.  He took the subjects of humor that Bill Cosby probably would do, but Eddie Murphy made it far more nastier.But, this performance on ""Raw"", just seemed like he had some indirect points to make regarding his own problems involving a particular woman recently in his life.  You can see and hear some sincere bitterness in this performance.Sorry Eddie.  I guess I'll just wait for ""Delirious"" to get released on DVD, hopefully, someday.Even Bill Cosby's 1982 performance on DVD called ""Bill Cosby Himself"", is alot more hilarious than Eddie's ""Raw"".  And Cosby's performance is generally quite clean.  And, to me, if you can be hilarious as hell, and get people rolling on the floor laughing, without having to be vulgar in any way, this is what makes a comedian great.  I've always thought that people who have to use fowl language to express themselves is usually a sign of someone trying, very loudly, to cover up their ignorance.  Black and white people both do it.

In the beginning, he even states that he receive some flack from Delirious and even turns those old jokes on Michael Jackson, Mr. T, and homosexuals right back around to date (after many unfavorable aftermaths) of which leads to his story on how Bill Cosby told him (over the phone) that he was a bad influence on his (now late) son.  ""Yoouuuuuu cannot saaaaaayyyy filth flarn filth flarn filth in front of people.""  He even confesses that Richard Pryor (the only celebrity that commended Eddie's comedy routines) was the reason why he wanted to pursue comedy as a career.  He goes on to the subject about the ups and downs of modern independant women who want ""half"" if you marry and divorce them.  He even advises men to have a J-O-B, find the perfect women for them, treat them well (before Dexter St. Jocques steals them away), be hip to the games their women play, get a ""prenuptual"" contract, and find an African ""bush"" woman if all else fails.  The African ""Bush"" Woman sketch was the best one because of his flawless impression on African women and it was an inspiration of what will become his best and funniest motion picture, Coming To America (in the next year).  Eddie concludes his show with a another sequel of his Drunken father's lectures from his butchered lyrics of famous motown songs to reflecting back to eating and wearing toys at childhood.  This film was an inspiration of hit songs released by Shaggy and Jay-Z in the early 2000s on a few of Eddie's Raw sketches like a cheating friend getting caught by his woman and the African ""Bush"" Woman.  Purple and black leather suits and brick flat topped fades may not make a comeback, but the magic of Eddie's jokes has never gone out of style.
