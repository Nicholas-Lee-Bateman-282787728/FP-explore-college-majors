The perfect primer for learning the social topography of our increasingly important neighbors to the East.But it's not a complete masterpiece. It relies primarily on archival footage. And though many of these films are rare, they are almost entirely gleaned from propaganda films. The directors fill in the gaps through interviews, some quite striking for youthful appearence of the elderly intervewees.It is remarkable for the way it concisely summarizes a complex and brutal history in 360 minutes. But what it lacks is investigative prowess and graphic brilliance.Granted, China is not the easiest country to conduct an investigation or shoot a documentary in.

680160,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,B00005RRID,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[57, 58]","The basic Amazon description of this DVD is confusing -- and that's unfortunate because this is a terrific selection of three of Susan Williams' four PBS documentaries on China.Contained in this set are ""China in Revolution,"" shown on PBS in 1989; ""The Mao Years,"" shown in 1994 -- and ""Born Under the Red Flag,"" aired in 1997. However, if you're a PBS-and-China watcher, you should know that Williams' more recent documentary, ""China in the Red,"" is not in this set. Personally, as a longtime journalist myself, I don't think this set suffers from its abrupt end with the decline of Deng Xiaoping. Williams' 2003 film, ""China in the Red,"" examined the lives of a handful of Chinese workers -- but China is evolving so rapidly that I would think Susan Williams herself would want to make a completely different ""Part 4"" to her series in 2008 than she did six years ago when she was assembling ""China in the Red.""Nevertheless -- this set is not, as the cover claims, ""Definitive,"" about China. After six hours, the history comes to a screeching halt with Deng's decline. Plus, China watchers are likely to quibble over a whole series of points in the course of the six hours. For instance, the U.S. decision to establish full diplomatic ties with Beijing in the late 1970s is presented with a former U.S. ambassador saying, ""All the Chinese were happy."" Well, that certainly wasn't the case with the ethnic Chinese living in Taiwan. They were stunned and disgusted at that news. Perhaps Williams could have at least touched on that point.Also -- if you watch this documentary at the same time you view ""Manufactured Landscapes,"" a much more contemporary visual meditation on industrial development in China, your head will snap around at Williams' footage of workers in newer factories. She presents this as essentially good news for smiling workers. ""Manufactured Landscapes"" is an absolutely haunting vision of those same workers.Having said all of that -- in an effort to clarify what this six-hour series is (and what it is not) -- my strong recommendation is: Terrific. Five stars. I've collected all sorts of books, films and other media about Asia -- especially about China -- and I can't find anything else that's this good and this encyclopedic in its documentary footage.Americans who want to know more about China -- and can hardly put current news into perspective, because we simply don't know the background -- buy a copy of this set, watch it with a small group and find out about a global power that we're all going to know a whole lot more about in the years ahead.",5,Clarifying Why This Superb Exploration of China Is Must-See TV for Americans,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,2581,"['basic', 'Amazon', 'description', 'DVD', 'confusing', 'unfortunate', 'terrific', 'selection', 'three', 'Susan', 'Williams', 'four', 'PBS', 'documentaries', 'China.Contained', 'set', 'are', 'China', 'Revolution', 'shown', 'PBS', '1989', 'Mao', 'Years', 'shown', '1994', 'Born', 'Red', 'Flag', 'aired', '1997', 'However', ""'re"", 'PBS-and-China', 'watcher', 'should', 'know', 'Williams', 'more', 'recent', 'documentary', 'China', 'Red', 'not', 'set', 'Personally', 'longtime', 'journalist', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'set', 'suffers', 'abrupt', 'end', 'decline', 'Deng', 'Xiaoping', 'Williams', '2003', 'film', 'China', 'Red', 'examined', 'lives', 'handful', 'Chinese', 'workers', 'China', 'evolving', 'so', 'rapidly', 'would', 'think', 'Susan', 'Williams', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'completely', 'different', 'Part', '4', 'series', '2008', 'did', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'assembling', 'China', 'Red', 'Nevertheless', 'set', 'not', 'cover', 'Definitive', 'China', 'six', 'hours', 'history', 'screeching', 'halt', 'Deng', 'decline', 'China', 'watchers', 'are', 'likely', 'quibble', 'over', 'whole', 'series', 'points', 'course', 'six', 'hours', 'instance', 'U.S.', 'decision', 'establish', 'full', 'diplomatic', 'ties', 'Beijing', 'late', '1970s', 'presented', 'former', 'U.S.', 'ambassador', 'saying', 'Chinese', 'were', 'happy', 'Well', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'ethnic', 'Chinese', 'living', 'Taiwan', 'were', 'stunned', 'disgusted', 'news', 'Perhaps', 'Williams', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'touched', 'point.Also', 'watch', 'documentary', 'same', 'time', 'view', 'Manufactured', 'Landscapes', 'much', 'more', 'contemporary', 'visual', 'meditation', 'industrial', 'development', 'China', 'head', 'will', 'snap', 'around', 'Williams', 'footage', 'workers', 'newer', 'factories', 'essentially', 'good', 'news', 'smiling', 'workers', 'Manufactured', 'Landscapes', 'absolutely', 'haunting', 'vision', 'same', 'workers.Having', 'said', 'effort', 'clarify', 'what', 'six-hour', 'series', 'what', 'not', 'strong', 'recommendation', 'Terrific', 'Five', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'collected', 'sorts', 'books', 'films', 'other', 'media', 'Asia', 'especially', 'China', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'anything', 'else', 'good', 'encyclopedic', 'documentary', 'footage.Americans', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'more', 'China', 'can', 'hardly', 'put', 'current', 'news', 'perspective', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'background', 'buy', 'copy', 'set', 'watch', 'small', 'group', 'find', 'out', 'global', 'power', ""'re"", 'going', 'know', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'years', 'ahead']",N/A
680161,A2MZXLN9TLP1R4,B00005RRID,GLBT,"[105, 108]","Wow.This series consists of six one-hour episodes, and takes you through the beginning of the 20th century up until the present. The story that it tells is so incredibly bizarre and tragic and thought-provoking that at times it was difficult to believe it was all true. The 2nd DVD in particular, which focuses on the reign of Mao, really made me realize how different the Chinese culture is from my own (USA) and what a traumatic history they've had in the past 100 years.One of the things I really appreciated about this series was how non-judgmental it was. At no point did I feel that the editor or producers had a political agenda. The point was not to demonize the Communists and also not to glorify them. Instead, it simply let you watch the events unfold and let you listen to the people who lived it as they attempt to explain to you (and to themselves) how all of these unbelievable things happened and how it felt to be in the middle of it all.You could really understand why, after living through Chiang Kai-shek's corrupt Nationalist rule, the people were so eager to follow Mao and to embrace his idealistic vision of a Communist State built of equality and justice. And, too, you could see how the whole thing slowly went off-kilter. As Mao became more and more removed from the day-to-day reality of the peasants, his ideas became increasingly demented. In a sense, he reminded me of Marlon Brando's character in ""Apocalypse Now,"" except that Mao was real and was in the position of leadership of almost one billion people.By the time the documentary got to the Cultural Revolution (the fourth of the six episodes), it's like you're watching some insane Monty Python-esque satire about revolutions within revolutions. Everyone was overthrowing everyone else, and all in the name of Mao.Watching this series will do far more than teach you some fascinating history; it will also make you re-examine all your most basic assumptions about how humans think and function. There's one woman interviewed who talks about an old man who was beaten to death shortly before her arrival, because a crowd of youths decided he was a Capitalist. She says at the end of the story that she still can't say for sure if she would have helped in beating him to death or not, had she arrived in time to do so. And this isn't some crazy woman saying this. It's someone perfectly sane and normal who simply got swept up in the times she was living in.I cannot recommend this series highly enough.",5,Far more than a History Lesson...,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,2489,"['Wow.This', 'series', 'six', 'one-hour', 'episodes', 'beginning', '20th', 'century', 'up', 'present', 'story', 'so', 'incredibly', 'bizarre', 'tragic', 'thought-provoking', 'times', 'was', 'difficult', 'believe', 'was', 'true', '2nd', 'DVD', 'particular', 'reign', 'Mao', 'really', 'made', 'realize', 'how', 'different', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'own', 'USA', 'what', 'traumatic', 'history', ""'ve"", 'had', 'past', '100', 'years.One', 'things', 'really', 'appreciated', 'series', 'was', 'how', 'non-judgmental', 'was', 'point', 'did', 'feel', 'editor', 'producers', 'had', 'political', 'agenda', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'demonize', 'Communists', 'also', 'not', 'glorify', 'Instead', 'simply', 'let', 'watch', 'events', 'unfold', 'let', 'listen', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'attempt', 'explain', 'how', 'unbelievable', 'things', 'happened', 'how', 'felt', 'be', 'middle', 'could', 'really', 'understand', 'why', 'living', 'Chiang', 'Kai-shek', 'corrupt', 'Nationalist', 'rule', 'people', 'were', 'so', 'eager', 'follow', 'Mao', 'embrace', 'idealistic', 'vision', 'Communist', 'State', 'built', 'equality', 'justice', 'too', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'whole', 'thing', 'slowly', 'went', 'off-kilter', 'Mao', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'removed', 'day-to-day', 'reality', 'peasants', 'ideas', 'became', 'increasingly', 'demented', 'sense', 'reminded', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'character', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Mao', 'was', 'real', 'was', 'position', 'leadership', 'almost', 'one', 'billion', 'time', 'documentary', 'got', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'fourth', 'six', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'watching', 'insane', 'Monty', 'Python-esque', 'satire', 'revolutions', 'revolutions', 'Everyone', 'was', 'overthrowing', 'everyone', 'else', 'name', 'Mao.Watching', 'series', 'will', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'teach', 'fascinating', 'history', 'will', 'also', 'make', 're-examine', 'most', 'basic', 'assumptions', 'how', 'humans', 'think', 'function', 'one', 'woman', 'interviewed', 'who', 'talks', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'beaten', 'death', 'shortly', 'arrival', 'crowd', 'youths', 'decided', 'was', 'Capitalist', 'end', 'story', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'helped', 'beating', 'death', 'not', 'had', 'arrived', 'time', 'do', 'so', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'woman', 'saying', 'someone', 'perfectly', 'sane', 'normal', 'who', 'simply', 'got', 'swept', 'up', 'times', 'was', 'living', 'in.I', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'highly', 'enough']",N/A
680162,A22RY8N8CNDF3A,B00005RRID,"Loyd E. Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[12, 13]","""China: A Century of Revolution"" is a six-hour video that covers its history during the 20th century - beginning while it was still ruled by an emperor and looked much like it had hundreds of years ago, and ending with the economic revolution initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Much of that period was consumed by fighting - starting with the emperor's overthrow, then Sun Yat Sen's coalition (supported by Russia) to oust foreigners and the warlords drawing support from them, followed by combat between Mao's Red Army and Chiang Kai Shek's Nationalists while also fighting the Japanese invasion, and finally ending with the resumption of the Civil War.Disc #1 takes viewers through the end of the Civil War. Russia's condition for supporting Sun Yat Sen was that he allow Communists to join. Accepting, Sun Yat Sen then appointed Chiang in charge of the military academy, with Chou En Lai his assistant. Sun died in 1925, leading to a struggle over leadership. In six months he defeated 34 warlords, and planned to purge the Communists upon taking Shanghai. Thousands were executed across the nation in the unexpected action; at that point Chiang's forces controlled China's heartland. He then led modernization programs in technology, medicine, transportation, and education, while the Communists rebuilt support in the cities based on the brutal labor conditions - 17-hour work-days and child labor, holding out Russia as the example of Utopia. Meanwhile Mao lead a group in southern China's rural areas - peasants there were upset about high rents, taxes being collected decades in advance, landlords taking the peasants' children as brides and slaves. Mao encouraged the peasants to rise up and expropriate landlords' property, formed the Red Army, and ended the practice of women being second-class citizens (bound feet, arranged marriages). Chiang's efforts to defeat the Red Army and its guerrilla tactics (lure the Nationalists in, then surround) were defeated four times before winning with a change of tactics and one million soldiers aided by planes and cannon.1934 saw the Communists losing badly in the south; Mao then led 87,000 to  break out of the area on the 'Long March' (6,000 miles) - en route Mao was declared head of the army, replacing a Russian advisor who was blamed for their defeats. Only 6-7,000 survived the march. Meanwhile, Japan began taking over parts of northern China, without opposition from Chiang - he saw the Japanese forces as far superior. This angered many Chinese. Mao wanted the two sides to unify against the Japanese - Chiang refused until his #2 kidnapped him and he was forced to agree. In 1941 Chiang broke the unity by attacking Red Army units, declaring them a bigger menace than the Japanese. U.S. leaders tried to re-unite, but favored Chiang despite obvious concerns about corruption. After WWII the Civil War continued full throttle, and Chiang made the error of overextending his forces. Many deserted to the Reds (with their new U.S. equipment), and Mao built support through land reform. Chiang retreated to Taiwan in 1949, and on 10/1/1949 the People's Republic of China was formed.Disc #2 is taken up by the Mao years, beginning with the civil war victory in October of 1949. People looked forward to a different type of revolution - one that would create a strong, industrialized China. The emphasis was on equality, with granting women's' rights one of the government's first actions. No more arranged marriages.Work units were set up, giving the Chinese Communist Part (CCP) direct control over everyone's lives. Peasants were given the land held by landlords, and an estimated hundreds of thousands died in the transition. Seeking assistance, China undertook a pact with the U.S.S.R., and soon after 250,000 thousands swarmed into North Korea to fight against the Americans. An estimated one million plus Chinese died. After the war, the government encouraged informers to report capitalists, those with ties to the prior regime or foreigners. Those reported were often led away, and many executed. Nonetheless, life was better for most Chinese.However, payment for the Soviet advisers and new industrial projects created an expectation for the rural farmers to increase production. Socialized farming and the collectivization of everything, including homes, followed. Farmers were only allowed to keep minimal amounts for themselves, production didn't increase, and there was wide-scale resentment.Responding to the resentment, Mao in 1956 called for constructive criticism (""Let 100 Flowers Bloom"") to assist improvement. Criticism did follow, but the intensity of reaction to corruption and the poorly performing economy was far more intense than anticipated. Reacting to rumblings within the government assembly, Mao reversed course and condemned the critics in 1957. A misunderstanding of his speech created an unofficial drive to identify and punish the assumed 10% who were 'rightists,' prison camps for about one million, and the silencing of intellectuals.Mao's 'Great Leap Forward' began in 1958 with the goal of doubling output in 15 years; the previous five years had already accomplished this. Children were placed in community care centers so their parents could work day and night. Local steel-making was a major component of the program - the furnaces eventually had to be fueled by reclaimed wooden coffins, and metallic home possessions. The resulting steel was mostly poor quality and useless, due to the primitive methods used.The CCP then returned to farming, and inflated expectations of production. The false expectations were met with false production reports, leading to even higher expectations. Meanwhile, about 30 million starved to death. Eventually Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution in 1966 in which 'Red Guard' brigades went out into the countryside to attack capitalists, western ideas, and old ways - the presumed causes of China's problems. About 400,000 were killed, including many officials. Mao ended this purge by calling out the army in 1968.At about the same time China had a fallout vs. Russia, Russia withdrew its advisers, and there was a armed brief conflict on the China-Russia border. Seeking a counterbalance, China encouraged rapprochement with the U.S., and President Nixon arrived in 1972. After Mao's death, the people slowly realized he had been a disaster. Yet, for a time his followers continued to lead.Disc #3 begins with China turning away from Mao - the Red Guards were shelved and sent out to the fields to work, and the 'Gang of Four,' led by Mao's wife, were arrested. However, Mao's thoughts still dominated. Deng Xiaoping maneuvered to the leadership role, and started his pragmatic leadership by exonerating those the Red Guards had sent to labor camps. The 'Democracy Wall' was established in 1978 Beijing, intended to support Deng's moves and the suppression of the Gang of Four - however, criticisms of the CCP led to its closure in 1979. Meanwhile, the 1978 drought led to experimentation, experimenting with the 'Household Responsibility System,' and soon afterwards, the end of commune farming. That same year also brought the 'one child' proclamation.Four Special Economic Zones were established and provided roads, electricity, and worker apartments - most importantly, foreigners were welcomed. At first the 'outsiders' were from Hong Kong and Taiwan.The Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 was the outgrowth of weeks of unrest protesting corruption, economic problems, and lack of Democracy. An estimated 200 died. The involved students were retaliated against when they received their work assignments.",4,"Excellent Overview, But Sometimes Lacking Detail",1265500800,"02 7, 2010",2010,7638,"['China', 'Century',

680163,A1B4JENU0QXJE0,B00005RRID,"Matt ""pattem""","[35, 38]","This is a wonderfully unbiased documentary on the 20th century history of China. It begins with the fall of an Empire and rise of Sun Yat Sen in 1911, and moves onto Chiang Kai Shek and Chairman Mao who are portrayed as leaders who participated in some of the most significant events that define the Cultural Revolution.I remember Secondary School curriculae that portrays the Nationalist Chiang as the 'good-guy', and Chairman Mao as the 'bad-guy' of chinese 20th century history. However, this documentary remains ambivalent on both of these matters, presenting the facts without bias by the producers. They expertly weave a history with evenhandedness making it impartial and objective to the sometimes very subjective matter that is The Cultural Revolution. The entire six hour documentary spans approximately 70 years, from 1911 (Sun Yat Sen) through to the rule and capitalistic tendencies of Deng Xiao Peng.While the objectivity of the documentary is laudable, the treatment of the subject matter is nothing short of exceptional. The intention of the documentary is to serve as an overview within a six hour time-frame. It is NOT intended as an in-depth political study of the times! Subsequently, the documentary does not getted bogged-down in too much detail, but simultaneously manages to adequately portray the events that defined 20th century China.On the whole this documentary is highly watchable, offering historical footage and interviews with those who participated in the Cultural Revolution in one form or another. Any curriculum study of 20th century China would be greatly enhanced by including this documentary. The documentary also serves as a great introduction to China for anyone interested in the country and how it has arrived at being the country it is today.",5,A documentary benchmark,1063152000,"09 10, 2003",2003,1788,"['wonderfully', 'unbiased', 'documentary', '20th', 'century', 'history', 'China', 'fall', 'Empire', 'rise', 'Sun', 'Yat', 'Sen', '1911', 'moves', 'Chiang', 'Kai', 'Shek', 'Chairman', 'Mao', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'leaders', 'who', 'participated', 'most', 'significant', 'events', 'define', 'Cultural', 'Revolution.I', 'remember', 'Secondary', 'School', 'curriculae', 'Nationalist', 'Chiang', ""'good-guy"", 'Chairman', 'Mao', ""'bad-guy"", ""'"", 'chinese', '20th', 'century', 'history', 'However', 'documentary', 'ambivalent', 'matters', 'presenting', 'facts', 'bias', 'producers', 'expertly', 'weave', 'history', 'evenhandedness', 'making', 'impartial', 'objective', 'sometimes', 'very', 'subjective', 'matter', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'entire', 'six', 'hour', 'documentary', 'spans', 'approximately', '70', 'years', '1911', 'Sun', 'Yat', 'Sen', 'rule', 'capitalistic', 'tendencies', 'Deng', 'Xiao', 'Peng.While', 'objectivity', 'documentary', 'laudable', 'treatment', 'subject', 'matter', 'nothing', 'short', 'exceptional', 'intention', 'documentary', 'serve', 'overview', 'six', 'hour', 'time-frame', 'NOT', 'intended', 'in-depth', 'political', 'study', 'times', 'Subsequently', 'documentary', 'not', 'getted', 'bogged-down', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'simultaneously', 'adequately', 'portray', 'events', 'defined', '20th', 'century', 'China.On', 'whole', 'documentary', 'highly', 'watchable', 'offering', 'historical', 'footage', 'interviews', 'who', 'participated', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'one', 'form', 'curriculum', 'study', '20th', 'century', 'China', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'including', 'documentary', 'documentary', 'also', 'great', 'introduction', 'China', 'anyone', 'interested', 'country', 'how', 'arrived', 'being', 'country', 'today']",N/A

If you are interested in China and its history of the Twentieth Century then watch this one!I have watch this and have felt sad at certain times since they like Russia have had such depressive history of females without rights, people not able to say what they want against the Emperor, and all that jazz.  Then Nationalism came along, Chiang Kai-shek took power and had a bloody all out battle against the Communists led by the infamous Mao Zedong.Then WW2 against the Japanese came along, then Mao took over and then it started going into the Mao years.I am glad that they had different opinions on Mao so that they could let us draw our own conclusions without forcing us to hate him,  they often overdo it with the Stalin biographies and don't even let us get a chance to know the private him.  Here is what I picked up from the Mao Years, Mao was evil in a much different kind of way, not because he meant to kill or harm that many people, but he knew about the suffering going on in the countryside and did not care and that is what made him evil.  Also he started that massive purge which almost looked like a dark comedy since he used teens and tweens to torture, humiliate and kill political enemies.All in all I'm sitting there wondering, ""What kind of a human being uses kids to harm adults like teachers, parents, and destroying monuments?"" Is it some kind of a sick joke, is it purely evil or purely foolish?  It is something that would look good to an immature kindergartner on paper, but in actuality it looks like hell on earth!Anyways, they got to the post-Mao years and talked about how freedom of speech is oppressed since people started to see Mao and the communist party's true colors.Then they talk about Tiananmen Square and how the kids protested as they started to learn about the outside world, but they still have no freedom of speech!Enough of this talk, watch the series, it will enlighten you and give you a perspective, if you watch closely enough you'll see people talk about ""there is an old saying that goes like this...""",5,Great Series!,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2093,"['wonderful', 'series', 'watch', 'are', 'interested', 'China', 'history', 'Twentieth', 'Century', 'then', 'watch', 'one', 'have', 'watch', 'have', 'felt', 'sad', 'certain', 'times', 'like', 'Russia', 'have', 'had', 'such', 'depressive', 'history', 'females', 'rights', 'people', 'not', 'able', 'say', 'what', 'want', 'Emperor', 'jazz', 'Then', 'Nationalism', 'came', 'along', 'Chiang', 'Kai-shek', 'took', 'power', 'had', 'bloody', 'out', 'battle', 'Communists', 'led', 'infamous', 'Mao', 'Zedong.Then', 'WW2', 'Japanese', 'came', 'along', 'then', 'Mao', 'took', 'over', 'then', 'started', 'going', 'Mao', 'years.I', 'am', 'glad', 'had', 'different', 'opinions', 'Mao', 'could', 'let', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'forcing', 'hate', 'often', 'overdo', 'Stalin', 'biographies', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'let', 'get', 'chance', 'know', 'private', 'Here', 'what', 'picked', 'up', 'Mao', 'Years', 'Mao', 'was', 'evil', 'much', 'different', 'kind', 'way', 'not', 'meant', 'kill', 'harm', 'many', 'people', 'knew', 'suffering', 'going', 'countryside', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'made', 'evil', 'Also', 'started', 'massive', 'purge', 'almost', 'looked', 'dark', 'comedy', 'used', 'teens', 'tweens', 'torture', 'humiliate', 'kill', 'political', 'enemies.All', ""'m"", 'sitting', 'there', 'wondering', 'What', 'kind', 'human', 'being', 'uses', 'kids', 'harm', 'adults', 'teachers', 'parents', 'destroying', 'monuments', 'kind', 'sick', 'joke', 'purely', 'evil', 'purely', 'foolish', 'something', 'would', 'look', 'good', 'immature', 'kindergartner', 'paper', 'actuality', 'hell', 'earth', 'Anyways', 'got', 'post-Mao', 'years', 'talked', 'how', 'freedom', 'speech', 'oppressed', 'people', 'started', 'see', 'Mao', 'communist', 'party', 'true', 'colors.Then', 'talk', 'Tiananmen', 'Square', 'how', 'kids', 'protested', 'started', 'learn', 'outside', 'world', 'still', 'have', 'freedom', 'speech', 'Enough', 'talk', 'watch', 'series', 'will', 'enlighten', 'give', 'perspective', 'watch', 'closely', 'enough', ""'ll"", 'see', 'people', 'talk', 'old', 'saying']",N/A
