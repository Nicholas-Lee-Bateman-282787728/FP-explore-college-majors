779630,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000DKDUT,A Customer,"[7, 11]","(...)My Comments:With the horrible reviews this movie received, I was certain it was going to be terrible.  I wasn't completely sure what to expect, but I do know Affleck is a terrible actor and Lopez is only occasionally bearable.  Ergo, the acting couldn't be good.  What's more, I had heard that it involved Affleck, of all people, convincing a lesbian to have sex with him.  I don't know a single woman that finds Affleck attractive.  So, to be completely honest, the only reason I wanted to watch this movie was to see how bad it is.If you approach the movie expecting it to be terrible, it doesn't disappoint.  As it turns out, the whole kidnapping thing is peripheral to Ricki and Larry's relationship.  I wasn't expecting this to be the case; I thought the lesbian encounter was only going to be a small part of the movie, but it is actually the focus of the movie.  The kidnapping is just a guise for having the lesbian/heterosexual love affair.  And considering no right-minded lesbian would change her mind for Ben Affleck, this just doesn't work.Since this is a major element of the movie, let me express a few more sentiments about it.  My wife made the comment that lesbians would probably find this movie offensive.  Though I'm not homosexual, let me see if I can explain why I agree with my wife.  While on a recent trip to Florida we saw a sign for Black Angus Beef that said, ""What vegetarians eat when they cheat.""  We are vegetarians and don't believe you can call yourself a vegetarian if you 'cheat'.  We found the sign offensive.  I'd say boycott Black Angus Beef, but everyone that would find it offensive already does (vegetarians).  In similar fashion, by saying Ben Affleck has what it takes to turn a homosexual into a heterosexual, they are positing something patently absurd.  I may exchange viewpoints with a political conservative with the intent of changing their mind, but we are not taking about opinions.  How many people would have found this movie offensive if it had been the other way around?  If, instead of Jennifer Lopez they had cast Matt Damon (Affleck's old buddy) across from Affleck and Damon had finally convinced Affleck at the end of the movie to become a homosexual (resulting in a gay sex scene), would there have been an outrage against this movie?  I'm inclined to think there would have been.  Instead, we, the brain-dead audience, are just supposed to accept this drivel.  Not going to happen.There are some additional problems with the story.  First, Ricki is hired to help Larry because, as she claims, she's tough.  Apparently her toughness is based on the idea that Steven Seagal is tough because he is a Buddhist and meditates.  Ricki goes around reading oriental books, practicing yoga, and pretending to be tough.  But in the end, the only time she ever touches someone is to have sex with Larry.  Real tough.  Then there's the whole sequence when Ricki's jilted ex-lover shows up.  No explanation is offered as to how she found out where Ricki was, but not two minutes after she shows up, she slits her wrists.  And a minute after that, she is completely forgotten.  The whole sequence with Ricki's lover is a perfect metaphor for the route this movie should take - it pops up on the radar screen, slits its wrists to end its miserable life, and is then quickly forgotten.On top off the bad story and all of the sexual commentary, when Ricki and Larry finally do make love there is nothing; no passion or excitement here.  No wonder Affleck and Lopez are on the rocks, or is it finally over?  I don't know nor do I care.  ""Gobble, gobble!""Having spent all this time on the story, should I even mention the acting?  Well, yes, because Justin Bartha isn't terrible.  He isn't Dustin Hoffman (Rainman), but he outshines everyone else (other than Pacino, who is in all of 3 minutes of the movie - 1 long scene).  Bartha was actually funny and interesting.  Affleck and J.Lo. should be banished to Siberia.  Neither can act.  Affleck was in it because, against all odds and the alleged talent requirement, he is now a big name in Hollywood.  J.Lo was in it for her body.  That's it.  It had nothing to do with their acting ability because, well, it's  non-existent.  I know of no other Hollywood actor who is so bad at expressing emotion using his facial expressions as is Ben Affleck.  When will the Hollywood big-wigs learn?Overall, I have to admit there were worse movies released during 2003 (Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was worse; so was My Life With Morissey).  But considering those movies were so bad they should be sunk in an abyss, it doesn't really mean Gigli is a good movie.  It's a very bad movie to be added to the long line of bad movies 'starring' Ben Affleck.  If you enjoy watching bad, offensive films, you may want to check out Gigli.  If you have a sense of decency, skip it.",1,"believe it or not, I have seen worse",1074470400,"01 19, 2004",2004,4861,"['Comments', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'movie', 'received', 'was', 'certain', 'was',

779634,A2WX1UESDOLXRE,B0000DKDUT,"Ashley Quinn ""Ash""","[2, 3]","I remember the hype for this movie before it even hit theaters, and it wasn't even good hype-- practically every critic, heck every person, was panning this movie. To be truthful, I didn't want to see it just because of what everyone else was saying and didn't see it until just recently when I finally decided that Gigli may actually be worth a buck to see. I'm glad I spent the dollar, if only to discover that this movie isn't as bad as everyone had said, but it's not good either.Ben Affleck plays Larry Gigli, an L.A. thug who is hired to kidnap and keep a close eye on a mentally challenged man (Justin Bartha-- National Treasure), who is the brother of some politician who won't cooperate with the mob. In comes Ricki, a tough-talking lesbian (Jennifer Lopez) who is hired to watch over Gigli and make sure he doesn't screw this up. Throughout this escapade, Gigli begins to realize that he has feelings for Ricki, feelings that he professes he's never felt before. He also realizes that his chosen profession isn't exactly something that he wants to do. Ricki feels the same way, on both counts.What could've been an interesting relationship between Gigli and Ricki is instead made into a love affair. It's not that Affleck and Lopez dont' have chemistry, because they do, it's that they're relationship is, well, awkward. Here we have a tough-talking lesbian who suddenly is fawning over Gigli? What's up with that?? Besides that, the movie is bogged down with too many extra storylines (like Ricki's ex-girlfriend slitting her wrists) and colorful characters (Gigli's mom) for any of the the principal characters to pack on some theatrical weight. Too much is going on in this movie for it to work. What does work, however, is Affleck. He turns in a solid performance as Gigli, perhaps one of his best performances. Too bad it's in a mediocre movie. I even enjoyed Justin Bartha's character, despite how stereotypical it is.I give this movie two stars, and while normally I wouldn't recommend a two star movie, I'm going to recommend seeing this anyway. Find out what all that hype was for yourself, stop avoiding this one in the video store, and formulate your own opinion of Gigli.

779636,A1EI65WJC85U68,B0000DKDUT,"BD Ashley ""vidiot_y2k""","[8, 10]","I rented this DVD months ago when it first came out simply to see if it could possibly be as bad as critics have said.  I squirmed through it and jotted a few meagre review notes before consigning it to my desk drawer.  I was so embarrassed that I hid my notes under my meagre collection of five porn magazines and prayed nobody would find them.I was very sad to see Martin Brest's name on this film.  You may recall back in the 80s that this man was talented.  He had promise- he directed the original BEVERLY HILLS COP & the De Niro classic MIDNIGHT RUN. Then at the tail end of the 90s he released his long-time pet project, MEET JOE BLACK; a movie that was half an hour too long despite having Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt in it.  I was squirming in my seat so much near the end, that I was seriously contemplating peeing into my empty coke cup.  But realizing this may have turned me into Dunedin's answer to Pee-Wee Herman (in more ways than one) I put all my willpower to use and made a serious beeline for the bog the second the credits rolled.By comparison GIGLI is shorter, but also a lot worse and seems to last just as long as MEET JOE BLACK.  On  evidence of his latest feature, Brest deserves to be blacklisted for life.Anyhoo, on to the ""movie"".  Ben Affleck is cast as Larry Gigli (but he plays Ben Affleck) : a half-witted, chauvinistic hitman assigned the task of  kidnapping an autistic kid who has the ability to learn the lyrics to rap songs  (why?).  In the biggest stretch of her acting career, Jenny From The Block plays Ricki;  a fellow contract killer who also happens to be a lesbian,  who is bought in to help the autistic kid change Larry's nappies & look after crime lord Al Pacino (in his biggest career embarrassment since 1985`s REVOLUTION).Through the course of the ""movie"" Ricki manages to make over Larry from a chauvinistic hitman, to Ben Affleck (the man who accepted an Oscar for a screenplay that two- time Oscar Winner William Goldman doctored. And who hasn`t penned doodly-squat since.  Hey, his autograph`s all he needs to  know how to write!).  They fall in love,  & the kid conveniently disappears from the flick altogether so we can suffer through more pointless Bennifer moments.  In fact the ""plot"" just seems to be a patchwork of bits and pieces thrown in.  Some may be horrified to learn that the movie was originally LONGER but some scenes were cut because preview audiences didn`t like them.  But Hollywood couldn't give a hoot about the opinions of the  people: they spoon-feed us their tripe and we movie buffs keep coming back because we're masochists at heart.In all fairness, GIGLI could have been palatable if Brest had chose to shoot the film digitally, as Mike Figgis did with his film TIMECODE.  One frame the movie as we know it, and the remaining three J.Lo's butt wiggling from different angles. Then the film could have been retitled JIGGLY and released with the faint hope that dirty old men in trench coats may unwittingly turn this into a sleeper hit. Oh, well. At least the sleeper part is accurate.The condensed version of my review could read like this:  GIGLI ranks alongside GLITTER and  SWEPT AWAY as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Frankly, it was highly improbable that a movie could be denounced as fervently as this one and be -gulp- the worst movie ever made, right?  Wrong wrong wrong.  There are some trite little movies that are so ridiculously terrible that they reach an apogee of unintended hilarity (I cite Cool As Ice, Vanilla Ice's debut film).  This is definitely not one of those films.  It took every fiber of my being to conclude viewing this.  There were indeed points when I thought my sanity would collapse, points were I literally became so disgusting lachrymose I would let out a caterwaul of horrendous pain.

I implore you with all my collocated being to avoid this ...Theperformances were so tremendously horrible they were beyond my perspicacity's tolerance.  I usually do enjoy Ben Affleck (he was particularly acute in Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting) but this is evidence enough for cinematic banishment.  If you want to laugh (as this dross will ineluctably fail at every attempt to wrest from you a single guffaw) read the positive reviews for Gigli.  By the way, to the self-important jackass who seems to believe an assessment from the SATs somehow constitutes an intellectual competence, I would volubly retort that The Pledge was a movie about suspense and psychological tension, it ostensibly did accomplish the prerogitive of being stimulating.  This cinematic aberration is merely a case of a movie that has an unsubstantiated confidence in itself; a movie that truly believes it is too cute for its own good; a movie that can indubitably emaciate any respect you might have had for its stars.

First things last, I was blown away to find out that Martin Brest wrote & directed this mess.  Midnight Run happens to be one of my favorite films of all-time.  Gigli actually tries to be Midnight Run on more than one occasion, along with Rain Man, Chasing Amy and any number of Elmore Leonard filcks.  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are atrocious.  Affleck's Brooklyn by-way-of Boston accent is comical.  His scene where he's flexing his muscles for a closet mirror is grounds for black-listing.  And I'm not even going to elaborate on his come-ons to Lopez.  She's not quite as bad, but her speeches on the female anatomy and ""people skills"" couldn't have been written by a human.  Then there's Al Pacino and Christopher Walken.  Hoo-ahhh!  Pacino's just plain awful - a completely stupid, over-the-top performance than he's been giving us more often than not lately (and yes, that includes Brest's Scent of a Woman, a completely overrarted film).  As far as Walken, he basically regurgitates his True Romance-Bluloo Boyle speech, then suddenly starts talking in some strange alien language where I honestly needed sub-titles.  And then he was gone.  There is so much wrong with Gigli, you could write a college thesis on the subject.  I haven't even touched upon the mentally disabled character.  The music.  Gigli's boss.

779642,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B0000DKDUT,Daniel K.,"[1, 4]","Gigli, the highly unsuccessful film of 2003 has been called so many horrible things, there is no need for me to list them.  I honestly had some hope for this film when I saw trailers for it, because I never pictured it to be this bad.  Also the film had a fine director, Martin Brest who made such critically acclaimed films as Scent of a Woman and Midnight Run along with Beverly Hills Cop.  Ben Affleck amazingly gave a watchable performance as Larry Gigli, a mobster.  Jennifer Lopez plays Ricki, Larry's love interest who turns out to be a lesbian.  The plot of this film could actually be called original but it just isn't a bit appealling.  It was also very boring and not at all entertaining.Gigli rated R for Pervasive Language, Sexual Content and Brief Strong Violence.  The film contains non-stop profanity, infact according to People magazine, the f-word is used 75 times.  The sexuality is reasonable, mainly one semi-explict sexual situation and sexual innuendo but no nudity.  The violence includes a point-blank shooting and a cut off thumb.Not at all worth seeing, I sadly saw it in theatres in addition to 3 other people.  I wonder what will become of Martin Brest's reputation as a film director, it looks like he should make a movie based on a bestseller instead of writing something from the top of his head or maybe he should've casted other actors besides Ben & Jen.  In a way I feel bad for him but I feel more disappointed in myself having lost a precious 2 hours of my life.  Definetly winner of worst film of 2003 or at least a solid nominee.  Funny this is there were other films in 2003 which did worst then Gigli and no one even noticied them.  These films include, Marci X, which only made $900,000.  Grind which made $2.6 million.  The Order also performed at the box-office taking in about $4.3 million.  Other flops included, My Boss's Daugther, Dumb & Dumberer & Duplex.  So all in all there have been films that have been much worse then Gigli.  Gigli taking in only $3.8 million and costing an astounding $54 million to make which will be remembered as one of the worse films ever made.  Is it possible the duplicate the success of Gigli, who knows?  All I can say is let's just pray for Ben & Jen in their next film together caller Jersey Girl, which is written & directed by Kevin Smith.

779645,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0000DKDUT,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[5, 5]","Outside of being part of the Kevin Smith alumni, Ben Affleck has never been a funny guy.  He's a good film-writer and had a couple of good dramatic roles, but he's not meant to be witty.  Matter of fact, after watching ""Surviving Christmas"", his vain attempt at comedy infuriates me.  Mainly, it has to do with his cocky attitude, the way he yells at people out of disgareement and such, not to mention how often he smug.  His abrasive and controlling temperament has never been charming feature of his, and he following this same path in ""Gigli"".Affleck plays the titular character, a button who was tasked by his loud superior to kidnap someone to keep a federal official quiet. The person he was ordered to sustain was a mentally-challenged man named Brian with Tourette Syndrome (very sensitive subject to follow, especially for a comedy). What Gigli didn't expect next was a house call from Jennifer Lopez, who plays Ricki the hitman; he tried to make a move on her, but she told him she's a lesbian (not this scenario again). Now both Gigli and Ricki has to work out their egotistical differences while they're waiting for orders as to what to do with Brian.The former movie couple were not believable in their roles. It's hard to believe Ben Affleck as a street thug; he's a guy that yells and punches people, but he's no hitman. And Jennifer Lopez fails to portray herself as a lesbian contractor; she didn't act intimidating enough to view her as a criminal, and her spot-spoken tone didn't help her one bit. Her as a lesbian is an ironic joke, because while she proclaims to vacuum carpets with her mouth, she spends the majority of the film being promiscuous towards the thug with no subtlety; she even made a ridiculous vagina monologue while's she stretching her legs in front of him. That's like if a Hooters girl told a customer not to touch her, but then she puts chicken wings on her cleavage for him to grab with his hands. Their relationship is the most cop-out of cop-out couples, and they're the least of the film's problems.I have a hard time seeing this as a comedy.  It's billed as a romance-comedy, but where are the jokes?  Is a mentally challenged person singing rap songs suppose to be funny?  Is Gigli yelling at Brian and calling him rude names worth the giggles?  Am I suppose to find humor in Ricki's ex-girlfriend who slit her wrists to try to get Ricki's attention?  What's with Christopher Walken and bribing people with pies?  Everyone's so serious with their roles that I can't figure out what I'm suppose to giggle.  Not even a brief scene with Al Pacino, playing the only character that I find partially interesting, manage to put me in a good mood.  All the characters were either conversing or doing monologues, but there's not a hint of humor in any of them; this isn't a smart comedy, the cast are just going along with with the script.Overall, ""Gigli"" is a cruel, mean-spirited movie which has all the similiar problems with mean-spirited humor akin to ""Duplex"".

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[67, 75]","It would be difficult to find a movie more loathsomely, hilariously bad than &quot;Gigli.&quot; Despite the tabloid buzz about its two photogenic yet stiff stars, interest in Gigli was generally restricted to the repulsed excitement of watching a train zooming toward a stalled car.Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a minor-league thug without much in the way of brains or talent. He's ordered to kidnap and imprison the mentally-challenged brother of a federal prosecutor, and he does so. After he's stashed Brian (Justin Bartha), in his apartment, Gigli gets a shock: His boss has sent Ricki, a hitwoman (Jennifer Lopez) to keep an eye on him.Lacking a brain, Gigli immediately begins pursuing Ricky, only to be semi-rebuffed by the announcement that she's a lesbian. Of course, he doesn't give up, and eventually despite her disgust for the male anatomy, Ricki starts to reciprocate his attraction. But things go haywire again when Gigli's boss decides to play nasty.Given the number of plot holes, &quot;Gigli&quot; should not be compared to Swiss cheese -- it should be compared with a fishing net in the advanced stages of decay. Through most of the film, it seems like the director just started direction, then walked off the set and said, &quot;Seeya! I'm sure you know what to do next.&quot;&quot;Gigli&quot; doesn't know whether it wants to be a crime movie, a drama, a romance, or a black comedy. So it tries to be everything, and accomplishes nothing. Needless gore, stupid plot twists (Gigli sawing off a corpse's thumb with a plastic utensil?), and completely unfunny material (the lesbian lover slashing her wrists) deprive this of all humor. But it might have struggled its way to mediocrity, if it weren't for the ghastly dialogue. (And that horrific shot of Mrs. Gigli's butt)I can only conclude that whoever wrote this movie was either on crack, or possesses a level of ineptitude on par with the title character's. &quot;Gigli&quot; contains some of the worst dialogue ever, including the insane &quot;bull and cow&quot; discussion, Lopez's bizarre &quot;turkey time, gobble gobble&quot; seduction, and the hideously embarrassing and frighteningly written argument about the pros and cons of male and female genitalia. It'll make you laugh or cry, or both.Affleck clearly has no idea what he's doing, and so wings it with an over-the-top, drawling imitation of Tony Soprano. Yet somehow he doesn't go over-the-top enough to make fun of himself (now THAT would be funny). Jennifer Lopez, with her perfect makeup, provocative yoga and baby voice, can't make her character even halfway convincing. You can't believe she's a thug, a lesbian, or that she could gouge someone's eyes out. Bartha might be good if he weren't retreading &quot;Rain Man.&quot; Cameos by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino can't save the story, although they are briefly entertaining to watch, being the only actors of worth that we get to see.There are one or two moments of actual humor in &quot;Gigli,&quot; such as the moment where the all-but-illiterate Gigli reads the tabasco sauce bottle. But a few flickering moments can't even begin to save the horrendous turkey that is &quot;Gigli.&quot; Gobble gobble.",1,A big fat turkey,1059955200,"08 4, 2003",2003,3193,"['would', 'be', 'difficult', 'find', 'movie', 'more', 'loathsomely', 'hilariously', 'bad', 'quot', 'Gigli.', 'quot', 'tabloid', 'buzz', 'two', 'photogenic', 'yet', 'stiff', 'stars', 'interest', 'Gigli', 'was', 'generally', 'restricted', 'repulsed', 'excitement', 'watching', 'train', 'zooming', 'stalled', 'car.Gigli', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'minor-league', 'thug', 'much', 'way', 'brains', 'talent', 'ordered', 'kidnap', 'imprison', 'mentally-challenged', 'brother', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'so', 'stashed', 'Brian', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'apartment', 'Gigli', 'shock', 'boss', 'sent', 'Ricki', 'hitwoman', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'keep', 'eye', 'him.Lacking', 'brain', 'Gigli', 'immediately', 'pursuing', 'Ricky', 'only', 'be', 'semi-rebuffed', 'announcement', 'lesbian', 'course', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'eventually', 'disgust', 'male', 'anatomy', 'Ricki', 'reciprocate', 'attraction', 'things', 'go', 'haywire', 'again', 'when', 'Gigli', 'boss', 'play', 'nasty.Given', 'number', 'plot', 'holes', 'quot', 'Gigli', 'quot', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'should', 'be', 'compared', 'fishing', 'net', 'advanced', 'stages', 'decay', 'most', 'film', 'director', 'just', 'started', 'direction', 'then', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'said', 'quot', 'Seeya', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'next.', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gigli', 'quot', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'crime', 'movie', 'drama', 'romance', 'black', 'comedy', 'be', 'everything', 'accomplishes', 'nothing', 'Needless', 'gore', 'stupid', 'plot', 'twists', 'Gigli', 'sawing', 'off', 'corpse', 'thumb', 'plastic', 'utensil', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'material', 'lesbian', 'lover', 'slashing', 'wrists', 'deprive', 'humor', 'might', 'have', 'struggled', 'way', 'mediocrity', 'were', ""n't"", 'ghastly', 'dialogue', 'horrific', 'shot', 'Mrs.', 'Gigli', 'butt', 'can', 'only', 'conclude', 'whoever', 'wrote', 'movie', 'was', 'either', 'crack', 'level', 'ineptitude', 'par', 'title', 'character', 'quot', 'Gigli', 'quot', 'worst', 'dialogue', 'ever', 'including', 'insane', 'quot', 'bull', 'cow', 'quot', 'discussion', 'Lopez', 'bizarre', 'quot', 'turkey', 'time', 'gobble', 'gobble', 'quot', 'seduction', 'hideously', 'embarrassing', 'frighteningly', 'written', 'argument', 'pros', 'cons', 'male', 'female', 'genitalia', ""'ll"", 'make', 'cry', 'both.Affleck', 'clearly', 'idea', 'what', 'doing', 'so', 'wings', 'over-the-top', 'drawling', 'imitation', 'Tony', 'Soprano', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'go', 'over-the-top', 'enough', 'make', 'fun', 'now', 'THAT', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'perfect', 'makeup', 'provocative', 'yoga', 'baby', 'voice', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'character', 'even', 'halfway', 'convincing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'thug', 'lesbian', 'could', 'gouge', 'someone', 'eyes', 'out', 'Bartha', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'were', ""n't"", 'retreading', 'quot', 'Rain', 'Man.', 'quot', 'Cameos', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'story', 'are', 'briefly', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'being', 'only', 'actors', 'worth', 'get', 'see.There', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'actual', 'humor', 'quot', 'Gigli', 'quot', 'such', 'moment', 'where', 'all-but-illiterate', 'Gigli', 'tabasco', 'sauce', 'bottle', 'few', 'flickering', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'save', 'horrendous', 'turkey', 'quot', 'Gigli.', 'quot', 'Gobble', 'gobble']",Gigli

Many critics called it the worst movie ever made AND audiences stayed away in droves.  How much of that was due to 1) a title that people unfamiliar with Italian couldn't pronounce correctly, 2) the media invasion of the private lives of stars Lopez and Affleck, or 3) an outdated but still festering homophobia  reaction to the idea of Jennifer Lopez playing a lesbian remains to be seen.  Or there may have been difficulty/comfort  in accepting brain-damaged characters both created by actors and by patients.  Whatever the reasons this film seems to have not been actually viewed for its own merits.Director and screenplay writer Martin Brest has created a smart film and knows how to handle touchy subjects as sensitively as the best of them.  The plot line is fairly simple: Affleck is a Mafia-like LA gangster enlisted to kidnap the brain-damaged young brother of a prosecutor, the mob thinking that this will make the prosecutor drop charges against a major gangster (a tasty little cameo for Al Pacino).  Not trusting Affleck's character to carry out his job, the mob enlists the backup of another important gangster (Jennifer Lopez) who just happens to be lesbian and thus not readily vulnerable to the macho plans of Affleck's ego.  From the moment Lopez knocks on Affleck's door there is a chemistry that only the blind eye could miss.  The three (two gangsters and their kidnapped victim) gradually work through the many thorns along the way of the story including a love scene and a confrontation scene between the leads, a hilarious but warm encounter with Affleck's mother (Lainie Kazan in an absolutely bravura performance) who shows understanding about Lopez' sexual orientation seeing the whole spectrum of sexuality with its still open door for a perfect wife for her son, and a brief but equally pungent role by Christopher Walken who smells the plot.  Actor Justin Bartha lends enormous credibility to the role of the brain-damaged lad and it is his character along with Lopez' that eventually lead (and accompany) Affleck's humanization.  And Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are beautiful and exciting to see as a new screen pairing.Yes, there is a love story and a comedy here, but far more important, there is a presentation of an opportunity to examine our own prejudices and misconceptions.  And for that reason (among many others) this is a film that deserves a much wider, much more open audience.

The crucial elements are the actors, directors, and the producers.Gigli is a bad film, theres no question about this. But if you take a look at who is involved this shouldn't be a surprise.Ben Affleck has never been an amazing actor and many of his films are not fine motion pictures which leave you speechless.Terrible Films Include Paycheck, Reindeer Games, Pear Harbor (Special FX do not make a good movie), Bounce and so on..Good cameo in Boiler Room, Good Will Hunting he will never top and Chasing Amy was a good film.Jennifer Lopez is mediocre at best in everything she does with the exception of her beauty, which is the only reason she is cast in anything. She is a beautiful woman, but this does not mean she can act or sing. NONE of her films allow her to display her acting ability, or lack there of, because she is incapable of acting. This isn't because she never took acting lessons, but because she is just a naturally terrible actress.Her films are Hollywood trash as well, i.e. The Wretched Wedding Planner, the Horrible Enough, and The God Awful Angel Eyes. She fit Selena well, but then again she is playing a Latin American singer. The Cell wasn't a horrible film but not due to her acting ability. Out of Sight was entertaining but this does not make her a great actress.Back to the point:Placing two mediocre actors in a film with a terrible screenplay equals a horrible movie. The problem with Gigli, or one of the many, is that it is incredibly boring. The acting stinks. The mentally challenged kid is horribly annoying. Plus most of the film takes place in Gigli's apartment. It feels very enclosed and just leaves you with no room. This would be find if it were a Hitchcock film, or a movie built around actors who dont need special effects or amazing choreography.The dialogue at times is MILDLY entertaining and borders upon interesting and then you realize this movie is going no where.IF you then add the bias of being sick of J Lo and Ben Affleck to begin with, then add the terrible hype surrounding the film plus all the negative reviews, its difficult to watch this film with a clean slate.You give it a try and realize this is a bad film. Not even because of the negative reviews which sway your judgement of the film to begin with. There is nothing right here. All great actors and directors have their bad films. But Ben Affleck is no Brando, Newman or Bogart and J Lo is a nobody. Her films barely ever make a profit and Affleck is already a Hollywood joke. He takes ANY role. There is a difference between being selective yet taking chances (as his buddy Damon does) and just taking any role that comes his way.I thought I might enjoy this film and prove critics wrong like usual, but they are not wrong this time. This is not a film that in time will be recognized as an overlooked flop that is indeed a marvelous film.

779661,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B0000DKDUT,Jeffrey Leach,"[6, 9]","When the Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez drama ""Gigli"" arrived on the scene last year, the critical reviews were immediate and vicious. ""Horrible,"" ""Terrible,"" ""The worst film of the year,"" and even ""The worst film in cinematic history"" were just a few of the comments heaped on this motion picture. A few fire breathers even went so far as to equate ""Gigli"" with such epic bombs as ""Heaven's Gate,"" truly an insult of epic proportions. Some whispered in tones overflowing with sinister connotations that the careers of director Martin Brest, as well as Affleck and Lopez, were possibly finished. All of this tumult inspired me for the first time in quite awhile. As a lover of the truly worst cinema has to offer, I knew I needed to see this movie as soon as possible. I couldn't see it in the theaters, however, because ""Gigli"" was already gone by the time I thought about going! We're talking gone in a week and a half! I vowed to rent the film on DVD as soon as it came out, a vow I didn't quite keep. Bad movies are so numerous that it's hard to keep track of them. I needed to see several other clunkers before sitting down to ""Gigli,"" but when I finally did I was a bit disappointed. The picture isn't nearly as bad as people made it out to be.""Gigli"" is a bad movie, though. Ben Affleck stars as Larry Gigli (rhymes with 'really'), a rather thickheaded hood responsible for shaking down deadbeats. When we first meet this blustering goon, he's putting a guy in a dryer at the Laundromat for failure to pay his debts to Gigli's boss Louis (Lenny Venito). As bad as this punishment sounds, Affleck's character gets into trouble because he lets the guy go with promises to come up with the money. Louis roars saucy comments at his underling, accusing Larry of being too soft on deadbeats. Despite failures to do what the bosses want, Louis amazingly (and unbelievably) taps Gigli for an even more important job. A federal prosecutor is gunning for Starkman (Al Pacino), the ultimate boss of the organization. In order to put some pressure on the government, someone comes up with the brilliant idea to kidnap the prosecutor's mentally challenged younger brother Brian (Justin Bartha) and hold him for ransom. It falls on Larry Gigli to abduct this fellow and keep him under wraps until Starkman's tormentor falls into line. Aware that his underling might botch the job, Louis sends a hit woman by the name of Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) over to Gigli's apartment to keep an eye on things. Watch the hijinks unfold!What follows is rather predictable and long-winded. Gigli, who considers himself a conqueror of women, works hard to put the charms on Ricki. Unfortunately, he soon discovers that this beautiful woman has little interest in men. She also has an attitude rivaling the pompous Gigli, so the two spend most of the film arguing about the roles of men and women in relationships as Larry seeks to find a way into Ricki's heart. The movie treats us to one ridiculous scene after another as Ricki challenges the thug's sense of self, including a meet and greet with Gigli's mother (Lainie Kazan in one of the film's few bright spots), comparing female and male genitalia, and a laughable showdown between a group of kids and Lopez's character. More nonsense follows: the moral dilemma arising when Ricki and Larry must decide whether to chop off Brian's finger, the entire subplot of Ricki's disgruntled and mentally unstable girlfriend, and just about any scene with Justin Bartha in it. The conclusion to this film ranks as one of the most unrealistic, sappy denouements I have ever witnessed in my movie watching career, and that's saying a lot.I could go on and on describing what doesn't work in ""Gigli."" Let's start with the credibility of Affleck and Lopez in their respective roles. Personally, I found it difficult in the extreme to accept either one as tough gangsters. The movie strives to present both of them as fundamentally decent people living a dangerous life, which takes away any sense of thrill almost immediately. You know Gigli won't hurt Brian, and you know Ricki won't either, so the film has nowhere interesting to go after these revelations. And Ricki's sudden acceptance of Gigli as a lover is so beyond reality that it strains belief. A further problem involves the lame dialogue. ""It's turkey time"" and ""gobble, gobble"" rank as only two mediocrities in a movie full of them. I kept imagining women cringing while watching this in the theater. If you can move past these problems, and you probably won't, you can watch the appearances of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino with openmouthed wonder. Why exactly did Walken's Detective Stanley Jacobellis show up at Gigli's apartment, chew the scenery for a few minutes, and then leave never to appear again? I dunno. Maybe Brest felt like Walken could punch things up for awhile. The same goes for Pacino, whose brief performance attains new heights in hysteria. I'm not even going to go into Justin Bartha's ""Rain Man"" rip-off act.As bad as ""Gigli"" is, the movie is far from the worst thing Hollywood ever foisted off on the public. Lopez is beautiful as always, Affleck doesn't destroy himself in his role, and although the movie runs for a lengthy two hours, the pace does zip along in places. Not surprisingly, the only extra on the disc was a trailer for the film. Wanna bet we won't see a Special Edition any time soon? I want to hear Affleck and Lopez do a commentary track for this movie! C'mon guys, you can do it! If I could stand watching this mess for two hours, you can come together for a group hug and a few comments, right?",2,"Gobble, gobble indeed!",1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,5619,"['When', 'Ben',

779664,A1Q4MNIUESQTBM,B0000DKDUT,John Schultz,"[2, 3]","The problem with this movie is the writing. After watching it. I was more impressed that J-lo, Affleck, Pacino and Walken were actually able to get into their roles. Especially given the lame-ass script they were given. Some of the scenes like the cow bull scene and the All powerful Vagina scene was some of the worst dialog I have ever heard. It made me laugh. I'm sure it made them roll their eyes also. One of the most unbelievable parts of this story is accepting that Affleck and J-lo are hard-ass thugs. Neither of them have that quality about them. At no point do we get to see them rough anyone up. So you are supposed to accept without proof that they can ""Get the job done"". It's Not plausible. The many examples of story issues are the single scene performances of Walken as the Detective, and Melissa Lahlitah Crider as J-lo's lover. They could be deleted and not effect the story. None of the characters were developed except the 3 main characters. And if Rain Man and Forrest Gump never existed I am sure we would be praising Justin Bartha's performance of Brian. He was a very likable character and had some lines that just made me laugh.I do not fault these actors for taking the money and running.So, Is this the worst movie ever made? Not in a long shot.

I would count myself in the camp of people who hate it as well, but saying it's the worst movie of all time is not accurate.There are some enjoyable scenes in this flick. Christopher Walken and Al Pacino are great in their short scenes. There is even some good banter between Ben Affleck and J-Lo at certain points.

It has no idea what it wants to be, starting with the name. Gigli? Really? You are going to name the movie Gigli and expect people to warm up to it?I like Ben Affleck. I think he has played some great roles, but this isn't one of them. At times he is amusing, other times his over acting is just uncomfortable to watch. J-Lo's beauty was about the only good thing I could say for her. She stumbles through this movie, obvious that she is hoping that Ben Affleck will pick up the slack. When he doesn't it's a nightmare.I felt like they ripped off Rain Man too much. A few good lines to pay homage to Rain Man would have been okay, but they keep going back to the Rain Man well. I couldn't tell if they were doing that on purpose, or if the screenwriter had no original thoughts. They would have been better off if they had just gotten Dustin Hoffman to reprise his role in this movie.I give it two starts because there are some things worth watching.

779675,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B0000DKDUT,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[8, 10]","Gigli has received a fairly poor reception. It has been described as the worst film of 2003, and an exercise in pandering to the egos of the two leads. I don't think it's that bad, but I can see why they say that.The plot is simple enough. Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) is a thug, working as an enforcer for a loan shark called Louis (Lenny Venito). Louis is worried about his boss (a cameo by Al Pacino), who has been arrested and charged by a federal prosecutor. Louis instructs Larry to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha), the prosecutor's mentally-challenged brother. But Louis doesn't trust Larry to get it right, so he sends another ""contractor"", this one a gay woman (Jennifer Lopez) who identifies herself as ""Ricki"", but admits shortly afterwards that it isn't her real name. So now we have the two of them minding Brian, and the stage is set for the (very conventional) conflict between two people working together.There are some speeches in this script that ring horribly false. The language is frequently coarse. I wonder if the script was originally written for someone like Eddie Murphy - he could have pulled off the speeches about being ""the gangster's gangster"" better than Ben Affleck, for example.Jennifer Lopez is a lot more threatening in Enough. She is just not credible as an ""enforcer"" in this film. And she wears a ridiculous amount of jewellery for a woman who is supposed to be ready to get physical. She could have been right for this part if the script let her.Ben Affleck is a lot more credible as a man lusting after a lesbian in Chasing Amy. In this film his performance is spotty, with his apparent intelligence seeming to rise and fall between scenes. I don't think it's his fault, though - I think it's more the fault of the script, and he has been mis-cast for theThis film isn't all bad, but there are some sorry bits. The whole of Christopher Walken's cameo is poor for example (he looks horribly ill), as is Missy Crider's scene (how did she find them?). And there are some (mercifully brief) gruesome moments, one involving a plastic take-away food knife, the other a fish tank. One wonders if the gruesome moments were attempts to make this a black comedy.All in all, this film feels as though the writer/director (Martin Brest) was indecisive, and unable to choose what kind of film he was making. He has written pieces of a romantic comedy, pieces of a black comedy, and pieces of a gangster comedy, but unfortunately he has assembled them all into the one film, and it just doesn't work. So, although I very much doubt that this is the worst film of 2003, I can see why it has been described that way.",1,Worst film of 2003?

779676,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000DKDUT,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 12]","So, the news out of Hollywood is that Ben Afflect does not want to do any more action movies in general and a sequel to his 2003 hit &quot;Daredevil&quot; in particular.  After the failure of &quot;Paycheck&quot; he is ready to give up on the genre and has declared that his next film, &quot;Surviving Christmas,&quot; represents &quot;me trying my hand at comedy.&quot;  Having read that, I know understand more than ever why the biggest thing wrong with &quot;Gigli&quot; is Ben Afflect.  He did not know it was a comedy.Affleck's performance stands out like a sore thumb in this 2003 film.  He hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; last week and he appears only slightly more comfortable in this film than he did in some of the lame skits he was put into on live television.  Affleck plays the title character in &quot;Gigli&quot; (apparently there are pronunciation issues with the name), and he is supposedly the muscle for Louis (Lenny Venito), a foul-mouthed L.A. mobster.  However, that would be &quot;muscle&quot; in the tradition of Rocky Balboa in the first &quot;Rocky,&quot; except with less muscle and maybe less brains.  He talks tough (he's apparently the &quot;Sultan of Slick&quot;); so tough that it is clear he is way over his head in this business and that is before Louis comes up with the stupid idea of kidnapping the mentally retarded brother of a federal prosecutor to help out a New York City mob boss.So, Gigli abducts young Brian (Justin Bartha) from his care facility and takes him home, where he is joined by Ricki (Jennifer Lopez).  She is everything that he is not, by which I mean she has serious presence as a mob enforcer, is a woman, and a lesbian.  Now, at this point we are supposed to acknowledge the heavy presence of the Bennifer phenomena and talk about how the on-screen chemistry between the two stars, who were either going together or actually engaged at this point in their roller coaster relationship, is below that of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman let along Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.  But my point of reference at this point was actually &quot;Chasing Amy,&quot; the first film in which Affleck's character fell in love with a lesbian and discussed the merits of heterosexual versus homosexual sex.The best scene in this film is when Gigli and Ricki make a case for their respective genitalia.  He delivers his bit standing up, shirtless, making forceful gestures.  She responds while reclining on the floor showing off her abs and doing stretching exercises that are almost as persuasive as the words she speaks.  When she is done even Gigli knows she is right, which is saying something since so little gets through his thick head.  But after that his character starts to calm down a bit and while Affleck never really fits into the movie, he pretty much stops going against the grain at that point.There are other noteworthy scenes in this film, although they all have to do more with characters than plots as a series of supporting characters come in have shining moments.  At one point while everybody is hiding out there is a knock on the door and in works Christopher Walken, who plays a cop and delivers what may well be the most eccentric line reading of a speech in his legendary career of eccentric line readings.  Lainie Kazan plays Gigli's mother who certainly does not respond in the traditional way to learning that the beautiful woman her son is with is a lesbian.  Then there is the mob boss from New York City, who turns out to be Al Pacino; say no more.  This might be a three star movie but it has all these five star scenes that help keep it afloat.  No way this was the worst film of 2003; that has to be &quot;My Boss's Daughter.&quot;Yes, there are holes in this plot.  You think that kidnapping the mentally retarded brother of a federal prosecutor is not something that is going to get covered on the news?  So taking Bryan out in public is pretty stupid.  But then if reality was the true standard for this film then neither Gigli or Ricki would be mob muscle, so there.  The end of the film leaves a lot to be desired because it stumbles around trying to find something to pass off as a happy ending: I was thinking along the lines of putting Bryan on a plane to Australia (because Down Under is a key part of this film).

The problem was all of the hype that surrounded it during the ""Bennifer"" craze. Okay, another problem was the fact that Ben Affleck is not believable as ANYTHING! He sucked in ""Good Will Hunting"" but I got the impression that he was just playing himself. But who would be scared of hit man named ""Gigli""? That's what you would name a toy dog!! By the time I saw this movie, Ben had left J-Lo at the alter and I was kinda pissed because she wasted a million dollars on a ""non-wedding"" instead of building a community center in the Bronx. Overall, the story here was pretty good with several humorous moments. You just have to brainwash yourself to forget that these two clowns were once an item and that they allowed their celebreality to overshadow the release of this film. Martin Brest should have sued them both for jeopardizing his project. He obviously believed in the script because he casted such heavyweights as Christopher Walken and Al Pacino.

779682,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B0000DKDUT,Mark Turner,"[5, 7]","There are a number of things that can make a bad movie. One is a bad story. Or how about bad acting? These are the two most obvious because they can be the most easily seen. Bad directing is harder to spot but comes through anyway. But perhaps the worst way a movie can be bad is in notoriety.GIGLI is a movie that was hyped not as the movie to go see but as one of the worst movies ever made. This was proclaimed before the movie hit a screen. And with all of this negative hype, is it any wonder that the movie sank at the box office? The question is is it really as bad a movie as they said?The answer is no, it is not nearly as bad as they claimed it was. The sun will continue to rise each morning and the moon at night. Tides will not pass over the coastline and wipe out the beachfronts from sea to shining sea. And movies will continue to be made, some even starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.Affleck stars as Larry Gigli (pronounced like really), a low level enforcer for mobster wanna be Louis. Gigli may be an enforcer, but he's a nice guy deep down as well which doesn't sit well with Louis. Especially on his latest job.Louis wants Gigli to kidnap a mentally handicapped young man named Brian from an institution and hold on to him until further notice. This is to help a top level Mafioso from the east coast who is being prosecuted by the young man's brother.Gigli follows through and later find a young lady knocking at his door. Enter Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), another employee of Louis sent to help. It seems that Louis doesn't have much faith in Gigli so he's sent her along as back up.The expected happens when Gigli puts the moves on Ricki. The unexpected happens when she tells him she is a lesbian. Macho Gigli, a stereotypical male if there ever was one, has his pride squashed. But that changes later when they have the chance of...well watch and see.The characters evolve as this movie progresses. Gigli is put in touch with who he really is. Ricki gets the chance to see the world a bit differently. And both of them find a fond affection for Brian, becoming more understanding as they get to know him.So why does everyone hate this movie? Perhaps it's because it moves along a bit slowly. Perhaps because some of the discussions between the two main characters, the main focus of the movie, are frank and up front. My best guess is that it has little to do with these items and more to do with the publicity bandwagon that started with the duo falling in love while the film was being made.The movie is not all that bad. The story is better than many movies released and the dialogue well written. Affleck's accent may be a tad off but hey, it isn't real life, it's a movie! The appearance of the film, everything from cinematography to lighting was wonderful. Both actors seemed believable in their roles. So what went wrong?I've read reviews and the things taken apart have seemed nit picky. When stars rise, it seems they become targets. Was the movie going to make strides in film making? No. Was it going to be the next best thing since sliced bread? No. What it was was an interesting story with some good and some bad dialogue.I guess the biggest mystery to me about this film was why it received such bad press and did so little money at the box office while movies like LEGALLY BLONDE 2 did so well? Now that movie had the content of a well filled diaper. I guess it all depends on the expectations one has when viewing a film. Go in expecting the worst here and you'll be happy.

One friend fell asleep, the other could take no more and left, while the rest of us said if we could sit through the whole thing, we could accomplish anything. Well, we did it, but for what? Gigli was ultimately pointless, possibly the worst film ever made. Why? Because while other films know they are bad and laugh at it, Gigli takes itself seriously, making it a hell of a lot worse than it should have been.

Well, for starters, I got it for only ?2.70 - my copy is an ex-rental, and also has a sticker on the back, saying it's original price is ?9.99, from Blockbuster, strangely enough. A definite bargain. Plus, according to some, I have extremely bad taste in movies, and my Pearl Harbour review on Amazon still says that '0 of x people liked this review'. No votes whatsoever. Right about now, after seeing what I have reviewed, there will be a series of head-banging and a hallelujah chorus of &quot;Oh Man!&quot;After getting ready to slate this movie like everyone else, I found myself really enjoying it!

I liked Jennifer Lopez in Maid In Manhattan, and I've liked Ben Affleck in nearly all the movies of his I've seen, and maybe putting a couple who are in love, and who are going to get a lot of publicity, in a movie was a bad idea. But no, they didn't learn from this. Jen also stars in Ben Affleck's latest, 'Jersey Girl', directed by Kevin Smith, and a fair chunk of her part has ended up on the cutting room floor. I did actually like Ben &amp; Jen in this movie - they looked like they had fun filming it, and although they do come out with the occasional stupid line, there's sometimes a slip in reaction, and Ben appears to be desperately trying not to laugh sometimes.It's also another Chasing Amy - Ben falls for a girl who prefers the more feminine figure shall we say! There's a good section where Larry &amp; Ricki (their characters) discuss the attributes of men &amp; women, and I'll have to say, it's a pretty fair discussion. (I liked the bit about the lips being the twin to something else)The whole storyline, as I've said, is an updated version of Rain Man, complete with gangsters, and harder language than &quot;friggin'&quot;. (Which Tom Cruise said a lot) But instead of Dustin Hoffman, you have the adorable Justin Bartha (Brian), playing the captive of Larry &amp; Ricki. It's never properly explained what is wrong with him - it always seems to be a mixture of things - but the ones that I can think of is, he seems to be autistic, and have Tourette's syndrome. (He swears a lot, and seems like he doesn't really understand what he's saying!) He gets &quot;captured&quot; from his school, purely on the premise he'll get to see Baywatch - no, not the TV show, THE Baywatch? Confused? He also likes his hip-hop music, and can often be found reciting the songs, but still not quite understanding what he's saying! (&quot;Baby Got Back&quot; is one of the more memorable ones he recites!) There's a funny scene, where he dances round in the kitchen, and then starts imitating Eminem or whoever, grabbing certain parts and giving a &quot;shout out to all my homies, Larry . . .&quot; and everyone else he can think of. Also, one scene which had me practically crying with laughter - which you can read in the subject line of this review. Larry gets asked what is Brian's name, and he tells the person &quot;his name is Bob&quot;. All you hear from Brian is &quot;His name is NOT Bob&quot;. He doesn't realise they're talking about him, the way he says it comes across as speaking about someone else, but I suppose you really need to watch the film to understand it.Christopher Walken (yes, he stars in a bad film), and Al Pacino also star in this. (Wow, I know, such brilliant actors actually take part in 'bad' films?!) Their parts aren't really that big. They're there, and they speak a lot of absolute garbage, and then they're gone.I can see why people thought it was so bad, but then again, I did enjoy it - and I'm yet to find another good review about it! Something tells me that's really NOT going to happen, don't you? To show how BAD people thought it was, in the UK it was dropped from every cinema after just a week; it broke the record for largest 2nd weekend drop in box-office, with an -81.9% drop; it became the first film in the history of the Razzie Awards to &quot;sweep&quot; all the top categories including, Worst Picture, Worst Director - Martin Brest, Worst Actor - Ben Affleck, Worst Actress - Jennifer Lopez, Worst Screen Couple - Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, and Worst Screenplay - Written by Martin Brest and by its third weekend on release, only 73 U.S. theatres were showing it, down from 2,215 during its first weekend, a drop of 97%.There's a reason why no one likes this movie - they can't look past the fact that Ben &amp; Jen were a couple, and Jen uses the press to paint her in a good light most of the time (you can tell that by the press after the whole gun incident when she was with P. Diddy). I like this movie. And my last point for this review is if we all liked the same things, the world wouldn't be a good place.",4,&quot;His name is Bob.&quot; &quot;His name is NOT Bob!&quot;,1087084800,"06 13,

Both have at least a dozen or so long speeches delivered by characters that have very little to do with the actual plot.  But that's where the similarity ends.To begin with, PF wasn't afraid to enter its world of violence.  Gigli, on the other hand, has absolutely no violence whatsoever until the very end.  While it is graphic, it is not the least bit interesting.  Also, because it's the only bit of violence in the whole film, it is strangely distasteful and even perhaps a bit unnecessary.The plot is absurd.  Never once does it stray into even remote plausability.  Never once did I believe Ben Affleck or Jennifer Lopez were actually criminals.  They never come across as threatening or even in control of the situation.I'm not going to insult their acting.

Since his boss does not completely trust in his abilities, he hires Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) another contract gangster to keep an eye on Larry.  After the kidnapping, the two find that the kidnapped man (Justin Bartha) is the younger brother of a Federal Prosecutor which translates to real hot water for them.  Larry who believes himself to be the epitome of a man is disappointed to find out that Ricki is a lesbian.  Regardless, he tries his best to impress her.  The best scene is when Ricki doing yoga and Larry are discussing what is more desirable the male or female form.  During their time together, Larry and Ricki due develop a relationship.

779709,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B0000DKDUT,Richard Ross,"[1, 2]","Gigli is an indefensibly terrible film. Affleck is so terrible that he's guilty of not only overacting but also being extremely annoying. Lopez looks sexy but that's about it. The film lasts for an unendurable two hours and change. The stupid plot has Affleck playing Larry Gigli, a mobster who's constantly being put down by his boss Louis. Louis wants Larry to kidnap a mentally retarded  man who is the brother of a high ranking politician. There's a mobster who's  facing  serious jail time and Louis hopes that the charges will be dismissed once the politician learns that his brother has been kidnapped. After Larry kidnaps the kid and brings him back to his place there is a knock at his door. When he opens it he's  surprised to see a sexy woman named Ricky (Jennifer Lopez). Larry learns that Louis sent her since he doesn't trust Larry to keep the kid hidden. Ricky resists all of Gigli's advances and informs him that she's  a lesbian which pisses him off a great deal. In spite of this deal breaker he lays so much macho b.s. on her that we suffer more than she does in having to endure this for two hours. You won't be surprised to learn that he cracks her tough exterior and she begins to fall for the idiot. The lines that these actors are forced to deliver are embarrassing to say the least. This film introduced the phrase ""Gobble, Gobble"" as a sexual invitation. What makes this movie tolerable are three great scenes. The first one involves Christopher Walken in a bizarre little cameo. He's his reliably weird self who plays a cop looking for information on the kidnapping. Larry is the first person he thinks to question and after his intimidation fails he goes into a rant about Marie Callendar ice cream. Because it's Walken and only he would pronounce words like that the scene is hilarious. The second scene is a discussion about male and female reproductive organs. That's a polite way of putting it since the language used is vulgar and graphic. The scene is sexy though since Lopez is saying these things while doing yoga in some skintight short shorts. The best scene of the film, in my opinion at least, is the Al Pacino cameo. He plays the mobster who is facing the serious jail time and who is responsible for the kidnapping. He's wearing a thick pair of glasses and his gray hair is tied into a ponytail to make him look older. He starts making bad jokes and flirting with Lopez before he turns serious and launches into a speech about what makes a person intimidating. Naturally it being Pacino that includes him yelling at the top of his lungs and throwing F bombs around but it adds some kind of excitement to such a slow and boring film. It is actually some of my favorite work of his. Those three scenes are the only relief you will find in this film so avoid it.",2,"""Rhymes with really"" as in really bad",1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,2801,"['Gigli', 'indefensibly', 'terrible', 'film', 'Affleck', 'so', 'terrible', 'guilty', 'not', 'only', 'overacting', 'also', 'being', 'extremely', 'annoying', 'Lopez', 'sexy', 'film', 'unendurable', 'two', 'hours', 'change', 'stupid', 'plot', 'Affleck', 'playing', 'Larry', 'Gigli', 'mobster', 'who', 'constantly', 'being', 'put', 'down', 'boss', 'Louis', 'Louis', 'Larry', 'kidnap', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'man', 'who', 'brother', 'high', 'ranking', 'politician', 'mobster', 'who', 'facing', 'serious', 'jail', 'time', 'Louis', 'charges', 'will', 'be', 'dismissed', 'once', 'politician', 'brother', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'Larry', 'kidnaps', 'kid', 'back', 'place', 'knock', 'door', 'When', 'surprised', 'see', 'sexy', 'woman', 'named', 'Ricky', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Larry', 'Louis', 'sent', ""n't"", 'trust', 'Larry', 'keep', 'kid', 'hidden', 'Ricky', 'Gigli', 'advances', 'informs', 'lesbian', 'off', 'great', 'deal', 'spite', 'deal', 'breaker', 'so', 'much', 'macho', 'b.s', 'suffer', 'more', 'having', 'endure', 'two', 'hours', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'tough', 'exterior', 'fall', 'idiot', 'lines', 'actors', 'are', 'forced', 'deliver', 'are', 'embarrassing', 'say', 'least', 'film', 'introduced', 'phrase', 'Gobble', 'Gobble', 'sexual', 'invitation', 'What', 'movie', 'tolerable', 'are', 'three', 'great', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'bizarre', 'little', 'cameo', 'reliably', 'weird', 'self', 'who', 'cop', 'looking', 'information', 'kidnapping', 'Larry', 'first', 'person', 'question', 'intimidation', 'rant', 'Marie', 'Callendar', 'ice', 'cream', 'Walken', 'only', 'would', 'pronounce', 'words', 'scene', 'hilarious', 'second', 'scene', 'discussion', 'male', 'female', 'reproductive', 'organs', 'polite', 'way', 'putting', 'language', 'used', 'vulgar', 'graphic', 'scene', 'sexy', 'Lopez', 'saying', 'things', 'doing', 'yoga', 'skintight', 'short', 'shorts', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'opinion', 'least', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'cameo', 'mobster', 'who', 'facing', 'serious', 'jail', 'time', 'who', 'responsible', 'kidnapping', 'wearing', 'thick', 'pair', 'glasses', 'gray', 'hair', 'tied', 'ponytail', 'make', 'look', 'older', 'making', 'bad', 'jokes', 'flirting', 'Lopez', 'serious', 'speech', 'what', 'person', 'intimidating', 'Naturally', 'being', 'Pacino', 'yelling', 'top', 'lungs', 'throwing', 'F', 'bombs', 'around', 'kind', 'excitement', 'slow', 'boring', 'film', 'actually', 'favorite', 'work', 'three', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'relief', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'so', 'avoid']",Gigli

Before I start my review let me give you 10 reasons why Gigli is such a bad film:01) No point.02) The goals of the characters are nonexistant03) The film runs way too long for a so called ""comedy""04) It's dialogue is pointless05) No chemestry06) Typical family members07) Cruelty towards the mentally handicapped08) Romantic ""comedies"" shouldn't involve the Mob or cutting of thumbs09) NO CONFLICT!10) Too clich&eacute;dOk, you've made it this far so I guess I should tell you what this garbage is all about. Well, Gigli (Ben) has to kidnap a mentally disabled nephew of a prosecutor in order to keep his boss out of prison (The boss is in the Mob...duh!). No one thinks he can handle it so they send in Ricki (Lake? No...Jen) to help him. Since Ricki's a lesbian, there will be no contact of ""that nature"" between them. And since Gigli's career (as well as Ben's, sadly) is going down the toilet, he must make his boss proad of him.And the thing about Gigli is that it's a bad movie that doesn't know how bad it is. What was going on at Columbia Pictures?! Were they trying to ride the wave of ""cool"" movies like Glitter or Spice World? Or were they trying to reach a goal of movies so awful they become a catchphrase?The dvd is barebones. A single trailer that lasts forever. The movie (if you want to call it that) is presented in an anamorphic 2.40:1 Widescreen ratio. Audio is 5.1 and there are other audio options so you can hear ""Gobble Gobble Gobble"" in other languages. Though you may not want to have the audio on because the score is so poor.By the way, I'm not just saying that its a bad movie. I'M TELLING YOU it is. I rented this from the library, and felt like I needed money for seeing it.Please, take my and other reviews that this movie is a dirty piece of garbage. We aren't playing with you.

779714,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0000DKDUT,Samuel McKewon,"[12, 16]","A collision of sex comedy, gangster motif, psychobabble and ""Rain Man,"" Martin Brest's ""Gigli"" is an unmitigated disaster of so many inconsistencies and opposing genres that it feels like the movie plays more or less at random, and would nod at being straight satire if a sentimental musical score didn't give it away. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez began their spotlighted courtship with this film, and no wonder they came together: Humans need shelter in storms.Affleck is the title character, Larry ""rhymes-with-really"", a head-banging thug charged with kidnapping the autistic brother (Justin Bartha) of a federal prosecutor who means to indict a New York crimelord (Al Pacino). Ricki (Lopez) is an independent contractor brought in to baby-sit the both of them.In reality, nobody's heart is in the kidnapping, including writer/director Brest, who uses the lesbian Ricki as a platform for his ideas on the gender identity war - we get the bull/cow argument, and a penis vs. vagina summit. Affleck's Larry is a bumbling, chauvinistic fool without class or even much self-control; within days, Lopez, whose creepy performance never rises above a whisper, has deprogrammed his entire thinking. In fact, Larry seems closer in intelligence and ambition to Bartha's autistic, who memorizes rap songs and fades in and out of cinema self-awareness whenever the plots see fit.Entire chunks of ""Gigli"" were left on the cutting room floor after failed test screenings, and what remains is an odd series of walk-on cameos with no direction or purpose. Christopher Walken is a cop who drops by to question Larry about the kidnapping. He promptly disappears. A former lover of Ricki's drops by to attempt suicide, she is taken to the hospital, she disappears. There's a quick visit to Larry's mother (Lainie Kazan). Pacino's gangster drops by to shoot a guy in the head, scream a little, then tap his heart in that oh-what-a-day-it's-been! thing Pacino has adopted.And Brian, the Bartha character, disappears whenever Brest wants to clear time for his two stars; at one point he left alone in Larry's apartment. Then again, he also spends a lot of time  in the backseat of Larry's convertible as the two contractors drive around LA. In this era of around-the-clock TV crime coverage, are these scenes to be believed?Brest has been building toward this kind of boondoggle for years. He wrote and directed ""Scent of a Woman,"" a good movie that was a bit full of itself. Then he directed ""Meet Joe Black,"" a very long movie very full of itself. Brest is a talented writer, and there are lines - entire scenes, in fact - in ""Gigli"" that work extremely well.But several of his bits are dated (Brian loves ""Baywatch""), one monologue piles on another, and by the movie's nearly 20-minute epilogue, we have grown tired of Affleck's glassy-eyed faraway stare, Lopez's furrowed, understanding brow and the idea that we're supposed to care who's bull, who's cow, who's straight or scared or gay or dirty or clean or, most of all, whose turkey's about to gobbled.",2,My verdict?

779716,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0000DKDUT,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[5, 7]","Gigli is one of those pitiful knockoffs of the Quentin Tarentino model of filmmaking: Likeable lowlife characters, an offbeat storyline, and quirky dialogue with loads of kitschy humor. Sadly the formula that works so well for Mr. Tarentino doesn't work all for Martin Brest. Awful is an understatement when describing this movie.Larry Gigli (gee-lee) is a bumbling Southern California mobster assigned by his boss to kidnap the disabled son of a federal prosecutor so they can blackmail him. But his boss doesn't trust him, so he sends a hit woman to help him do the job. Gigli spends most of the movie trying to hit on the hitwoman-but she's a lesbian. In between fights with high schoolers, lesbian lovers, yoga, orders from his boss and arguments, arguments arguments, we're supposed to believe these two try to make us believe there's a romance between them. This must have worked on paper because it doesn't work on the screen. In the end he lets the boy go on the set of Baywatch, his favorite show. (Which was cancelled during the time this movie was made) While he uses pick up lines on an extra, Gigli drives off into the sunset with the hit woman.I've seen my share of bad movies and this is the new number one worst film I have ever seen in my life. (See some of my other reviews.) Nothing I've endured on a late Saturday Night can compare to how awful this movie is. Not White Chicks. Not Black Samurai. Not even Smurfs and the Magic Flute. The screenplay must have been a collaborative effort between chimps and a box of rocks; they're the only two groups this would make sense to. Perhaps chimps were executives involved in the preproduction too. I mean, how does something this puerile get greenlit for production by a human being? What imbecile would think this script is worth investing millions into? No plot, long rambling monologues, a story that goes round and round in circles, and characters with the personality of wet cardboard decorated with mustard and ketchup. I think a bunch of elementary school kids could come up with a better script than this during arts and crafts.Director Martin Brest lenses a slow tedious movie that goes nowhere over the course of ninety minutes. In his attempt to add his own distinct flavor to the Tarentino formula, he tries to put a Rain Man vibe to it mixed in with a little Tao of Steve. Blending the softer touch with the gritty characters ends up with a bland derivative movie with no personality and no ideas of its own. Outside of the cinematography the entire movie is a mess. I have to ask one question to the director and producers of this film: Who wears leather jackets in the summertime in Southern California?Ben Affleck is his usual horrible self here. Watch him use the same facial expression for oh- just about everything. Jennifer Lopez is so hammy here she belongs in a sandwich. She has no chemistry with Affleck and is completely over the top in most scenes. I couldn't believe her as a mob hit woman or a lesbian, she's just J.Lo superstar here again. Oscar winners Al Pacino and Christopher Walken are wasted here their cameos add nothing to this mess. Lanie Kazan is the only actress who manages to pull a decent performance out of this mess. In her cameo as Gigli's Mom she steals the scenes she's in with her warm energy and dynamic presence.Get as far away from this Tarentino wanna-be as you can. If you like films in this genre, get the real deal from the man himself. Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown or the Kill Bill series are far better than this hackneyed mess.",1,Gigli is really bad,1177286400,"04 23, 2007",2007,3548,"['Gigli', 'one', 'pitiful', 'knockoffs', 'Quentin', 'Tarentino', 'model', 'filmmaking', 'Likeable', 'lowlife', 'characters', 'offbeat', 'storyline', 'quirky', 'dialogue', 'loads', 'kitschy', 'humor', 'Sadly', 'formula', 'so', 'well', 'Mr.', 'Tarentino', ""n't"", 'work', 'Martin', 'Brest', 'Awful', 'understatement', 'when', 'describing', 'movie.Larry', 'Gigli', 'gee-lee', 'bumbling', 'Southern', 'California', 'mobster', 'assigned', 'boss', 'kidnap', 'disabled', 'son', 'federal', 'prosecutor', 'can', 'blackmail', 'boss', ""n't"", 'trust', 'so', 'hit', 'woman', 'help', 'do', 'job', 'Gigli', 'most', 'movie', 'trying', 'hit', 'hitwoman-but', 'lesbian', 'fights', 'high', 'schoolers', 'lesbian', 'lovers', 'yoga', 'orders', 'boss', 'arguments', 'arguments', 'arguments', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'two', 'try', 'make', 'believe', 'romance', 'must', 'have', 'worked', 'paper', ""n't"", 'work', 'screen', 'end', 'boy', 'go', 'set', 'Baywatch', 'favorite', 'show', 'Which', 'was', 'cancelled', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'pick', 'up', 'lines', 'extra', 'Gigli', 'off', 'sunset', 'hit', 'woman.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share', 'bad', 'movies', 'new', 'number', 'one', 'worst', 'film', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'See', 'other', 'reviews', 'Nothing', ""'ve"", 'endured', 'late', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'can', 'compare', 'how', 'awful', 'movie', 'Not', 'White', 'Chicks', 'Not', 'Black', 'Samurai', 'Not', 'even', 'Smurfs', 'Magic', 'Flute', 'screenplay', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'chimps', 'box', 'rocks', ""'re"", 'only', 'two', 'groups', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'chimps', 'were', 'executives', 'involved', 'preproduction', 'too', 'mean', 'how', 'something', 'puerile', 'get', 'greenlit', 'production', 'human', 'being', 'What', 'imbecile', 'would', 'think', 'script', 'worth', 'investing', 'millions', 'plot', 'long', 'rambling', 'monologues', 'story', 'round', 'round', 'circles', 'characters', 'personality', 'wet', 'cardboard', 'decorated', 'mustard', 'ketchup', 'think', 'bunch', 'elementary', 'school', 'kids', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'script', 'arts', 'crafts.Director', 'Martin', 'Brest', 'slow', 'tedious', 'movie', 'nowhere', 'course', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'attempt', 'add', 'own', 'distinct', 'flavor', 'Tarentino', 'formula', 'put', 'Rain', 'Man', 'mixed', 'little', 'Tao', 'Steve', 'Blending', 'softer', 'touch', 'gritty', 'characters', 'up', 'bland', 'derivative', 'movie', 'personality', 'ideas', 'own', 'cinematography', 'entire', 'movie', 'mess', 'have', 'ask', 'one', 'question', 'director', 'producers', 'film', 'Who', 'leather', 'jackets', 'summertime', 'Southern', 'California', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'usual', 'horrible', 'self', 'here', 'Watch', 'use', 'same', 'facial', 'expression', 'oh-', 'just', 'everything', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'so', 'hammy', 'here', 'sandwich', 'chemistry', 'Affleck', 'completely', 'top', 'most', 'scenes', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'mob', 'hit', 'woman', 'lesbian', 'just', 'J.Lo', 'superstar', 'here', 'again', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'cameos', 'add', 'nothing', 'mess', 'Lanie', 'Kazan', 'only', 'actress', 'who', 'pull', 'decent', 'performance', 'mess', 'cameo', 'Gigli', 'Mom', 'scenes', 'warm', 'energy', 'dynamic', 'presence.Get', 'far', 'away', 'Tarentino', 'wanna-be', 'can', 'like', 'films', 'genre', 'get', 'real', 'deal', 'man', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Jackie', 'Brown', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'series', 'are', 'far', 'better', 'hackneyed', 'mess']",Gigli

It usually happens like this: 3AM - I wake up just before he tries to stab me in the heart or throw scaulding hot wate in my eyes, all the while he's crying and screaming something about how the chalky taste of lima beans is where the world's chalk comes from, weird I know.

So there we are, snuggling in the living room, eating smelts and watching Gigli. Never before have I seen such chemistry and sexual tension between the two leading stars. The only thing I can compare it to would be the sexual tension between Hans Gruber and John MaClane from Die HArd - remember, you were always thinking - when are these guys going to start kissing? Remember? no? That's because there was absolutely NO sexual tension AT ALL between them, all John Boy cared about was removing Ellis's watch from his wife's wrist just in time so that Hans couldn't kill them both and plummet 60 stories to his miserable death. I digress, this isn't a review about Die Hard, is it now? So anyway, in a nutshell - Ben Affleck's supposed to be tough (gay) and a loner who's threatened by others invading his territory. Enter J. LO, another 'hit-man' who is also tough (gay) and then the story unfolds. They hate each other, they love, they hate, they kill, they love, roll credits, begin the stabbing and the crying and the death and the teeth and the ribbing and the lopping and the maiming.

779724,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000DKDUT,Tsuyoshi,"[8, 11]","Many say this is one of the worst films ever made in Hollywood.  Finally I got a chance to see how bad it could be myself, and, yes, it is really bad.  Some people are trying to defend it, I know, but how can we save this messy film from being where it should be, when it got six awards of the now notorious Razzie Award? -- Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst On-Screen Couple, Worst Director, and Worst Script?  Even 'Battlefield Earth' could not beat this 'sweep.'In 'Gigli' you see Ben Affleck as 'Gigli' (say 'Gee-lee'), a killer who is hired as debt collector now.  He is so tender-hearted that for all his intimidating speech, he cannot be real bad.  Then, he is assigned a job of kidnapping a mentally-challenged boy, who is a brother to a public prosecutor.  Gigli is so kind that he never threats or uses violence; he talks the boy into leaving the house, promising him to take to 'Baywatch.'  So far, the film is mildly entertaining.Then, things begin to look bad.  J-Lo's character Ricki is also sent to Gigli's house where the boy is, which means joint-kidnapping plan, which Gigli doesn't like.  But of course this is a film made for the stars, and Ben and Jennifer sooner or later find themselves attracted to each other, as you expect from the very beginning.In 'Gigli' however, being seductive means J-Lo saying: 'It's turkey time ... Gobble, gobble,' THE immortal lines that would remain in your mind forever.  There is J-Lo's small lecture given to noisy kids, about how to extract eyes and visual memories from your brain, which is totally irrelevant.  There is another lecture on women's sexuality from her, which is as embarrassing as listening to someone else's pillow talk.  And in 'Gigli' these ruses all work!There is chemistry between Ben and Jennifer, but considering their profiles (at that time), why not?  They are not playing the characters they are supposed to be; they are just what they are, and that's why no one believes the story, that tries to make us believe that they are crinimals.The weak story meanders for more than two hours, and even if you get the cameos of Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, two great New York-based actors.  their turns are at best mundane and ordinary.  And Al overacts again, just like Al when he is bad.I don't believe it's directed by Martin Brest, but it's true.  The humor of 'Beverley Hills Cop' is all gone; instead, you get a vanity project that ended the same way as the lamentable 'Ishtahl.'  And like that film, 'Gigli' is just boring.

While I agree it isn't the greatest movie ever made it certainly has some retaining qualities.Jennifer Lopez, playing a lesbian hit woman, does a really good job on this project. She is deep, thoughtful and sensitive but understandably hiding behind a tougher exterior. Her character is the soul of the movie. Certain scenes are rather erotic but in a necessary effort to explain the beauty of sex to a less than qualified man, who happens to be played by Ben Affleck. In the scene on the yoga mat Lopez is seductive and enticing but speaking with poetic justice about the differences between the sexes and sex. Lopez grounds the movie by keeping her leading man from acting violently and continuously attempting to find some depth somewhere down inside what appears to be just another shallow hitman.Ben Affleck is alright in this movie, not much more can really be said. His character is tough and impatient but somehow Affleck doesn't quite have what it takes to pull it off. When he sticks to the sensitive scenes and when he starts to show his love for Lopez's character he becomes more real and some depth in his portrayal can be found.The star of this film is in my opinion is Justin Bartha who plays a mentally challenged young man who is kidnapped by Ben and Jen. Bartha personifies the innocence and inexhaustible curiosity of the mentally challenged with great skill. He masters the lyrics of rap songs, has a religious obsession with Baywatch and loves to dance making most of his scenes quite entertaining.So watch it.....it is worth a few hours and won't stay with you forever. The ending is touching and many scenes show a nice blend of compassion and romance. Don't miss Al Pacino, of course, who never has a bad scene! Take the time to make up your own mind about this one.",3,No Matter How You Pronounce It......Not So Bad!,1091491200,"08 3, 2004",2004,1871,"['hearing', 'what', 'critics', 'had', 'say', 'movie', 'expected', 'worst', 'agree', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'retaining', 'qualities.Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'playing', 'lesbian', 'hit', 'woman', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'project', 'deep', 'thoughtful', 'sensitive', 'understandably', 'hiding', 'tougher', 'exterior', 'character', 'soul', 'movie', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'are', 'rather', 'erotic', 'necessary', 'effort', 'explain', 'beauty', 'sex', 'less', 'qualified', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'played', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'scene', 'yoga', 'mat', 'Lopez', 'seductive', 'enticing', 'speaking', 'poetic', 'justice', 'differences', 'sexes', 'sex', 'Lopez', 'movie', 'keeping', 'leading', 'man', 'acting', 'violently', 'continuously', 'attempting', 'find', 'depth', 'somewhere', 'down', 'inside', 'what', 'be', 'just', 'shallow', 'hitman.Ben', 'Affleck', 'alright', 'movie', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'said', 'character', 'tough', 'impatient', 'somehow', 'Affleck', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'what', 'pull', 'off', 'When', 'sensitive', 'scenes', 'when', 'show', 'love', 'Lopez', 'character', 'more', 'real', 'depth', 'portrayal', 'can', 'be', 'found.The', 'star', 'film', 'opinion', 'Justin', 'Bartha', 'who', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Ben', 'Jen', 'Bartha', 'innocence', 'inexhaustible', 'curiosity', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'great', 'skill', 'lyrics', 'rap', 'songs', 'religious', 'obsession', 'Baywatch', 'dance', 'making', 'most', 'scenes', 'quite', 'entertaining.So', 'watch', '..it', 'few', 'hours', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stay', 'forever', 'ending', 'touching', 'many', 'scenes', 'show', 'nice', 'blend', 'compassion', 'romance', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'course', 'who', 'never', 'bad', 'scene', 'Take', 'time', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'one']",Gigli

I will say if you don't enjoy hearing about the celebrity relationship at hand, skip it.  The onscreen interactions between Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are mainly centered around romance, which is misleading since 'Gigli' was supposed to be a drama.  But knowing what cultivated from their working together, all we can see is Ben and Jen, Hollywood's most infamous couple.  Therefore it's hard to believe that J.Lo is a lesbian and that both work small time in the mob business.  The only thing that saved the movie is the comedy.  Affleck is particularly funny with his Soprano-like voice and his selfish, ""gangster's gangster"" demeanor.  Even Justin Bartha, who plays the retarded boy, manages to generate a few choice laughs (his tourette's takes the cake).Simply put, the plot for 'Gigli' is very, very weak.  Affleck's character of Larry Gigli is assigned to kidnap the brother of a federal prosecutor in order to free his boss from numerous charges.  Then everything is thrown for a loop when Ricki (Lopez) is sent to ""watch over"" him, and vice versa.  Larry's self-image and ego are then truly seen as he brags about his place in the business, though it only comes off sounding like an ""I don't need a woman to do my job""-type thing.  Then things are again heightened as Larry puts the moves on Ricky; only for him to sadly discover she is a lesbian ('Chasing Amy' anyone?).  From there it's hard to tell if the two are close friends or callous enemies.  Whatever the case may be, the two soon find their job revealing more then they can handle.  In time, the plot and actions develop into nothing short of your basic mediocrity.  But, overall,  the comedy and cameo appearances by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino make for a decent, worthwhile film.It is hard to categorize this movie.  It succeeds mostly at comedy, though the drama that develops with the kid is somewhat amiable; the romance is just one of those things that needs to be taken with a grain of salt if you want to enjoy yourself.  If you are a big fan of either Lopez or Affleck, you will probably walk away from 'Gigli' thinking it was worth your time.  However, if you're looking for an enticing mobster/crime drama, you'll walk away chanting the bad names already associated with it (one example: ""a big fat turkey"").  I enjoyed this film mainly because Ben Affleck is one of my favorite actors, though I can obviously see why critics would hate it.  But as you should know, critics are not always right.  Give it a shot.

Let's just say it would probably be more entertaining and enjoyable to sit through a double feature of the Care Bears Movie and the Teddy Ruxpin Movie (1999) than this heap.  Why?  Acting, plot, chemistry.. shout out of anyone spots these, they do a great job hiding.  The only nominal performances go to Walken and Pacino, aptly chagrined at the display of their talents like guys who mistakenly wear tuxedos to a monster truck rally.  I've seen this film compared to 'Glitter' and 'Crossroads' and that's pretty accurate; it's an awkward derivative ego piece ironically showcasing all the wrong aspects of its purported stars.

Apparently so, have you guys seen what's in theatres lately? Gah. As for Jennifer Lopez, to be honest, I'm tired of her. She's like a leech. Trying to make movies, trying to act, and trying to take credit for designing clothing and fragrances. PLEASE! What a joke! This woman is spreading herself thin. I find no redeming qualities in this laughing stock hollywood so stupidly gives meager roles to. Please get her off of the screen! Jennifer Lopez is one of the most over rated actresses there is. I am still trying to figure out her appeal to everyone. Jennifer Lopez has absolutely no talent. Her fame, wealth and celebrity is an insult to all true artists that are struggling to make it. She is not a natural beauty. She wears layers of makeup and she has to have her body taped into position in order to look presentable in her $10,000 evening gowns. The girl sucks. She is just an example of how the media can force worthless, talentless, and shallow people upon the masses. All of the acclaim she has gotten she in no way deserved. Ben Affleck almost lost what little credibility he has in Hollywood as an actor with this film. He's actually watchable in some movies (Chasing Amy, Dogma, Good Will Hunting, Daredevil: The Director's Cut, Jersey Girl), although he's not very versatile. If you want to remain a fan of either of these people, it's in your best interest (and also in the best interest of all the movie stars in this film) for you NOT to go watch it. I repeat, DO NOT WATCH GIGLI. I can only hope from this moment on that I have done my part in saving other movie-goers from disappointment and pain.
