77247,AO37T54VEP0JQ,0784012679,"B.C. Scribe ""trekviewer""","[4, 4]","This fresh cinematic spin on the infamous &quot;Hit Man&quot; doesn't seem to be well known and that's a shame.  'The Hit' is very sly and cunning, stepping far astray from the usual efficiency associated with these individuals, and contains ingenious plot twists guaranteed to keep you guessing.  Though it is British the film remains accessible to all moviegoers; the accents are easy to understand and the dialogue is not completely bound to British standards.A pair of hit men, Braddock, a wily veteran and Myron, a greenhorn, track down former gangster Willy Parker, who squealed on his former partners and has been hiding out in Spain for ten years.  The hit men intend to take Willy to Paris to meet his former boss before he is summarily executed but an unexpected complication occurs that throws the plan into disarray.  Attempting to alleviate the problem only causes it to snowball beyond belief and soon the two hit men are forced to take a hostage along the way.  Willy's lackadaisical approach to his certain demise displeases his &quot;escorts&quot; who expect him to be quite fearful of his impending doom.  The hostage is a bit of puzzlement as well and Myron takes it upon himself to look after her interests.  As events continue unfolding causing more chaos it isn't long before Myron is questioning Braddock's control of the situation.To say anymore would be an unforgivable transgression; suffice it to say that 'The Hit' is a movie you won't regret having spent time watching.  Besides being directed by Stephen Frears it also features Terence Stamp, John Hurt and Tim Roth - his film debut - in the three key roles.  The screenplay allows for a few terrific action sequences, frequent suspense, laugh-out-loud humor and even some very memorable scenery in Spain.  The theme music performed by Eric Clapton is among the best of his compositions and he gets an assist from Roger Waters of Pink Floyd fame.  'The Hit' is a movie deserving of cult status for its many offbeat touches and unconventional manner of storytelling.  Do yourself a real favor and set aside some time to watch this film - but beware!  You'll find that once isn't enough!",5,"Clever, crafty and roguish British genre film",1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,2165,"['fresh', 'cinematic', 'spin', 'infamous', 'quot', 'Hit', 'Man', 'quot', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'well', 'known', 'shame', 'Hit', 'very', 'sly', 'cunning', 'stepping', 'far', 'astray', 'usual', 'efficiency', 'associated', 'individuals', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'twists', 'guaranteed', 'keep', 'guessing', 'British', 'film', 'accessible', 'moviegoers', 'accents', 'are', 'easy', 'understand', 'dialogue', 'not', 'completely', 'British', 'standards.A', 'pair', 'hit', 'men', 'Braddock', 'wily', 'veteran', 'Myron', 'greenhorn', 'track', 'down', 'former', 'gangster', 'Willy', 'Parker', 'who', 'squealed', 'former', 'partners', 'been', 'hiding', 'out', 'Spain', 'ten', 'years', 'hit', 'men', 'intend', 'take', 'Willy', 'Paris', 'meet', 'former', 'boss', 'summarily', 'executed', 'unexpected', 'complication', 'plan', 'disarray', 'Attempting', 'alleviate', 'problem', 'only', 'snowball', 'belief', 'soon', 'two', 'hit', 'men', 'are', 'forced', 'take', 'hostage', 'way', 'Willy', 'lackadaisical', 'approach', 'certain', 'demise', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'expect', 'be', 'quite', 'fearful', 'impending', 'doom', 'hostage', 'bit', 'puzzlement', 'well', 'Myron', 'look', 'interests', 'events', 'continue', 'unfolding', 'causing', 'more', 'chaos', ""n't"", 'long', 'before', 'Myron', 'questioning', 'Braddock', 'control', 'situation.To', 'say', 'anymore', 'would', 'be', 'unforgivable', 'transgression', 'suffice', 'say', ""'The"", 'Hit', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'having', 'spent', 'time', 'watching', 'being', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'also', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'film', 'debut', 'three', 'key', 'roles', 'screenplay', 'few', 'terrific', 'action', 'sequences', 'frequent', 'suspense', 'laugh-out-loud', 'humor', 'even', 'very', 'memorable', 'scenery', 'Spain', 'theme', 'music', 'performed', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'best', 'compositions', 'assist', 'Roger', 'Waters', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'fame', 'Hit', 'movie', 'deserving', 'cult', 'status', 'many', 'offbeat', 'touches', 'unconventional', 'manner', 'storytelling', 'Do', 'real', 'favor', 'set', 'aside', 'time', 'watch', 'film', 'beware', ""'ll"", 'find', 'once', ""n't"", 'enough']",N/A

As his testimony ends the accused begin to sing ""We'll meet again"" as their threat to seek revenge for his incriminating testimony.The time and location now shifts and Willie has been relocated in a small rural town outside of Madrid, Spain. Unfortunately for Willie the passing of years has not erased the memory of his betrayal from the minds of his enemies. He is kidnapped by a professional killer none only as Mr. Braddock (John Hurt) and his assistant Myron (Tim Roth) to be escorted to Paris where he will have a brief reunion with ""old friends"" before he is to meet his inevitable fate.However the journey doesn't go as planned for the abductors. Another passenger joins the group, a beautiful, buxom young woman named Maggie (Laura del Sol). While Mr. Braddock likes to keep things uncomplicated he can't bring himself to kill the lovely Maggie. The clever Willie seizes on the opportunity and begins to use her presence to undermine the main goal of the kidnappers, attempting to turn one against the other as he plans his escape.Critique: Released in '85, `The Hit' is a satisfying psychological drama boasting three stellar performances from Terence Stamp, John Hurt and Tim Roth. This film presents a slow paced, nuanced, storyline that maybe a little difficult for some viewers to handle, but if you open yourself to the slower pace you will reap its rewards. Presented in an artsy, minimalist format, the film is cleverly counter balanced by a high energy Spanish flamenco soundtrack that does wonders for the atmosphere and texture of the viewing experience.There are a couple of negatives but they rest in the production values of the DVD not in the film itself. It is full-screen instead of widescreen which bothers a film purist like me. There are also a couple of minor but noticeable wobbles in the picture, but they are brief and won't really distract you. So give it a watch, you won't be sorry. Once you cast your eyes upon Laura del Sol you won't be able to pull yourself away from the screen whether you like the film or not.",4,"""We'll Meet Again...Some Sunny Day""",1185408000,"07 26, 2007",2007,2189,"['Synopsis', 'Criminal', 'Willie', 'Parker', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'testifies', 'partners', 'London', 'courtroom', 'order', 'secure', 'own', 'freedom', 'testimony', 'accused', 'begin', 'sing', ""'ll"", 'meet', 'again', 'threat', 'seek', 'revenge', 'incriminating', 'testimony.The', 'time', 'location', 'now', 'Willie', 'been', 'relocated', 'small', 'rural', 'town', 'Madrid', 'Spain', 'Unfortunately', 'Willie', 'passing', 'years', 'not', 'erased', 'memory', 'betrayal', 'minds', 'enemies', 'kidnapped', 'professional', 'killer', 'none', 'only', 'Mr.', 'Braddock', 'John', 'Hurt', 'assistant', 'Myron', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'be', 'escorted', 'Paris', 'where', 'will', 'have', 'brief', 'reunion', 'old', 'friends', 'meet', 'inevitable', 'fate.However', 'journey', ""n't"", 'go', 'as', 'planned', 'abductors', 'passenger', 'group', 'beautiful', 'buxom', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Maggie', 'Laura', 'del', 'Sol', 'Mr.', 'Braddock', 'keep', 'things', 'uncomplicated', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'kill', 'lovely', 'Maggie', 'clever', 'Willie', 'opportunity', 'use', 'presence', 'undermine', 'main', 'goal', 'kidnappers', 'attempting', 'turn', 'one', 'other', 'escape.Critique', 'Released', ""'85"", 'Hit', 'satisfying', 'psychological', 'drama', 'boasting', 'three', 'stellar', 'performances', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'film', 'slow', 'paced', 'nuanced', 'storyline', 'maybe', 'little', 'difficult', 'viewers', 'handle', 'open', 'slower', 'pace', 'will', 'reap', 'rewards', 'Presented', 'artsy', 'minimalist', 'format', 'film', 'cleverly', 'counter', 'balanced', 'high', 'energy', 'Spanish', 'flamenco', 'soundtrack', 'wonders', 'atmosphere', 'texture', 'viewing', 'are', 'couple', 'negatives', 'rest', 'production', 'values', 'DVD', 'not', 'film', 'full-screen', 'instead', 'widescreen', 'film', 'purist', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'minor', 'noticeable', 'wobbles', 'picture', 'are', 'brief', 'wo', ""n't"", 'really', 'distract', 'So', 'give', 'watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'Once', 'cast', 'eyes', 'Laura', 'del', 'Sol', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'away', 'screen', 'film', 'not']",N/A

The glowing, existential reviews are purposely written in a seemingly sham-like manner and are mostly perfect.  John Hurt wears a white suit and tie the whole time and definitely overplays his role trying to be cool instead of staying within his performing element, almost like he was trying to hurry the process along and get the off the set (not character driven at all with no character development).

DeRiemer,"[1, 1]","Stephen Frears' forgotten movie (it sank without a trace when it was released) has recently, thanks to Criterion, now received some of the recognition and love it deserves.Willie Parker (Terence Stamp), a career crook, ratted out his mates. In exchange for testifying against them in court he received a new identity and a comfortable retirement in a village in Spain. Still, he knew his former comrades would sooner or later come after him. Ten years later, they do.Braddock (John Hurt), an emotionless, professional hitman, and his young, excitable apprentice, Myron (Tim Roth), take Willie and set out to drive to Paris and the gang leader he betrayed. A Spanish police officer (Fernando Rey) is after them. Willie seems to accept his fate, but he begins to plant questions in the minds of Braddock and, especially, Myron. Violent incidents happen. It seems likely Willie isn't going to make it alive to the French border. In Madrid they wind up having to take with them Maggie, the girl friend of a fat Aussie crook. Soon Braddock and Maggie are fighting, with Myron trying to protect Maggie. Now Willie seems to have accepted his fate with a serenity that worries Braddock. But it seems that Willie's serenity depends on Braddock. The conclusion to this fine film may be a tad confusing (even the actors aren't sure in the commentary). With a movie this good, all that means is there'll be good conversation after watching it.The acting is exceptional. One accepts that with Stamp, Hurt and Roth. In The Hit, even the smallest roles are pungent.

The Hit is also one of the best, stylish crime thrillers to come out of the 1980s along withThief,To Live and Die in L.A. (Special Edition),Mona Lisa - Criterion Collection, and a few others.There is an audio commentary by director Stephen Frears, actors John Hurt and Tim Roth, writer Peter Prince, and editor Mick Audsley. Audsley says that his first edit of the film focused on Willie but Frears suggested that he take another shot at it and shift the focus to Braddock. He points out that the shot of Braddock during the opening credits signifies the emphasis on Braddock. Frears and Prince talk about the film's origins and how it was inspired by actual events. Roth tells some entertaining anecdotes, including how he learned to drive a car during the course of the film. Hurt offers his observations of working with Roth and how he became involved in the project. This a solid track that is typical of you would expect from a Criterion DVD release.""Parkinson One-to-One: Terence Stamp"" features an interview with the actor in 1988 by popular British talk show host Michael Parkinson. Stamp talks about the lull in his career after the 1960s and how he was lured back to work on the Superman films because of the chance to act opposite Marlon Brando.

77255,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,0784012679,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","The Hit, 1985, Art House cinema that bridges the gap to popular film. The movie is somewhat slow, but full of drama, careful framing, fantastic editing, and is the role model for movies to follow.The film opens with Willie Parker, a gangster, rating out his partners in a British court. As he leaves the courtroom, the convicted partners all sing a song about meeting some sunny day. The film then jumps forward to ten years later on a very sunny day, in a very remote town in Spain, where Willie is kidnapped and driven to his death in payment for the rating out. The story is fairly simple; it's the journey that matters.Criterion has worked their magic on this film. The original gritty, grainy film is so clear in the darker scenes. Bright dusty scenes are crystal clear. The transfer to digital is well near perfect. The sound is fairly flat, no surround sound, and concentrates on dialog with almost no special effects. The DVD includes an approximately 40 minute late 1980's Granada Television interview with Terrence Stamp (Willie Parker). Terrence is acting the whole time, he is slow and deliberate in all his responses. It is a fairly good dessert after watching The Hit.There is a thread that feels very similar to the original Transporter (The Transporter). The director, Stephen Frears went on to do some amazing films; High Fidelity, Dangerous Laisons, The Grifters, Mrs. Henderson Presents, and the stinker Cheri (Cheri). Tim Roth plays the infantile apprentice hit man Myron, went on to be the lead in Lie To Me, was Pumpkin in the opening before credits scene in Pulp Fiction, The Incredible Hulk, Invincible, Reservoir Dogs, and Bodies Rest and Motion. Terrence Stamp has since appeared in, Smallville, Get Smart, Star Wars Episode 1, and Wall Street to name a few movies. John Hurt plays the hit man sent to pick up Willie. Hurt has a very long history of film acting, stretching back to the Elephant Man, Midnight Express, Contact, and V for Vendetta. Across the board, performances are excellent.The almost hour and forty minute film is the perfect length. Pacing is excellent.

Terence Stamp is a gangster-turned-grass who has spent ten years hiding in a quiet Spanish village, methodically educating himself.  One day he is kidnapped by a gang of juvenile delinquents working for two hitmen, ominously taciturn John Hurt and his volatile young protege Tim Roth.  So begins a bizarre road movie in which all the usual film noir rules are tragicomically tweaked.'The Hit' resembles 'The Killers' in the story of two assassins baffled by the calm resignation of their target (this is the opening situation of the film; I am not revealing anything).  Stamp is a comic joy, relaxed, amused and watchful, completely unnerving two thugs who had expected a gibbering coward.  'The Hit' has been called an Absurdist thriller, with Stamp as an existential Everyman; the silent police are perhaps the implacable agents of Fate rendering futile human endeavour.But this is to miss the 'Third Man' element, the great gusts of comedy that deflates the 'philosophy': the jaunty jangle of Spanish guitar; the delicious interplay between amazing actors, whose mixture of menace and ordinary blokishness anticipates Tarantino; the giddy shifts in tone; Frears' taste for mischievous, distorted, wide-angled compositions.  The opening court-room scene, when the convicted prisoners jeer a murderous 'We'll Meet Again' at a startled Stamp, is worth the movie alone.  There are even Graham Greene-like allusions to 'Don Quixote' and Spanish picaresque which gives a certain nobility to the Hurt character, a vicious gangster who subtly becomes the film's true hero, embodiment of its more enigmatic moments, such as the extraordinary misty-glade sequence, coming upon a man who should have run away, communing with a mystical realm to which he has no access.This is not to suggest the film is a spoof - the violence when it comes is distressingly real; but it is in this hybrid tension of modes and genres that Frears' best work has always been done, and 'The Hit' is a little classic.",4,Three brilliant actors have the time of their film lives.,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,2113,"['Imagine', 'dark', 'claustrophobic', 'films', ""'The"", 'Killers', ""'The"", 'Third', 'Man', 'shot', 'bright', 'desert', 'spaces', 'sunny', 'Spain', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'gangster-turned-grass', 'who', 'spent', 'ten', 'years', 'hiding', 'quiet', 'Spanish', 'village', 'methodically', 'educating', 'One', 'day', 'kidnapped', 'gang', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'working', 'two', 'hitmen', 'ominously', 'taciturn', 'John', 'Hurt', 'volatile', 'young', 'protege', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'So', 'bizarre', 'road', 'movie', 'usual', 'film', 'noir', 'rules', 'are', 'tragicomically', 'tweaked', 'Hit', 'resembles', 'Killers', 'story', 'two', 'assassins', 'baffled', 'calm', 'resignation', 'target', 'opening', 'situation', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'revealing', 'anything', 'Stamp', 'comic', 'joy', 'relaxed', 'amused', 'watchful', 'completely', 'unnerving', 'two', 'thugs', 'who', 'had', 'expected', 'gibbering', 'coward', 'Hit', 'been', 'called', 'Absurdist', 'thriller', 'Stamp', 'existential', 'Everyman', 'silent', 'police', 'are', 'perhaps', 'implacable', 'agents', 'Fate', 'rendering', 'futile', 'human', 'endeavour.But', 'miss', ""'Third"", 'Man', 'element', 'great', 'gusts', 'comedy', ""'philosophy"", 'jaunty', 'jangle', 'Spanish', 'guitar', 'delicious', 'interplay', 'amazing', 'actors', 'mixture', 'menace', 'ordinary', 'blokishness', 'Tarantino', 'giddy', 'shifts', 'tone', 'Frears', 'taste', 'mischievous', 'distorted', 'wide-angled', 'compositions', 'opening', 'court-room', 'scene', 'when', 'convicted', 'prisoners', 'jeer', 'murderous', ""'ll"", 'Meet', 'Again', 'startled', 'Stamp', 'movie', 'alone', 'are', 'even', 'Graham', 'Greene-like', 'allusions', ""'Don"", 'Quixote', 'Spanish', 'picaresque', 'certain', 'nobility', 'Hurt', 'character', 'vicious', 'gangster', 'who', 'subtly', 'film', 'true', 'hero', 'embodiment', 'more', 'enigmatic', 'moments', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'misty-glade', 'sequence', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'run', 'away', 'communing', 'mystical', 'realm', 'access.This', 'not', 'suggest', 'film', 'spoof', 'violence', 'when', 'distressingly', 'real', 'hybrid', 'tension', 'modes', 'genres', 'Frears', 'best', 'work', 'always', 'been', 'done', ""'The"", 'Hit', 'little', 'classic']",N/A

The three things that make this different and better are the three actors involved. The young hood who acts tough but really may not have the stomach for this kind of thing is Tim Roth, the true professional hit man who has little patience for his young accomplice and would be apprentice is John Hurt. And the target for the elaborate hit is the always exquisite Terence Stamp who knows it has been coming all the years and has become very philosophical, almost welcoming it when it finally appears. Stamp too was a pro and that makes both Hurt and Roth admire him, even revere him perhaps for accepting things like he does. There is action but most of it is character interaction, which is very good. Visually the most exciting scenes are in Spain where Stamp has been hiding it out in a very comfortable country villa, but the trip back to Paris presents several interesting villages and vistas. Frears later did Dangerous Liasons which I also like but this smaller film is my favorite of his primarily because of the Stamp character and Terence Stamp himself. If you've seen anything of his from Billy Budd to Fellinis Toby Dammit to Pasolinis Theorem to The Limey, you know he is one of the most interesting screen presences you will ever encounter, The Hit was made when he hadn't been seen in a picture for a while so the fact that the character he plays in The Hit has also been out of circulation for awhile gives the role an added dimension.Later Reservoir Dogs made Tim Roth famous and for good reason but here you get his debut doing it all for the first time.

Tim Roth (one of his first roles), John Hurt, and Terence Stamp all contribute knockout performances in roles that match their personas perfectly--Roth as Myron, the cocky, quick tempered young thug whose boss, Braddock (John Hurt), embodies the cynicism that intelligent criminals feel after being in the life for a number of years.  And Terence Stamp is Willie Parker, the rat, another British gangster who squealed on his mates ten years earlier and has been hiding out in sunny Spain all the while.Enter Braddock and Myron to nab him and bring him to vengeful justice at the hands of Mr. Corrigan, the gangster boss.  To do so, they'll drive Parker through Spain and into France--Paris, in particular, where Corrigan has now set up shop.  But complications arise along the way, not least of which is a stopover in Madrid where the gangsters pick up a beautiful, earthy hostage played by Laura Del Sol, a fiery young woman who knows men well.  Very well.With a great score by Paco de Lucia, one of Spain's premier guitarists, and cinematography rhapsodizing the glories of the Spanish countryside, this is truly a unique film.  The journey of these four by car on the dusty roads of Spain brings to the fore their need, in various ways, to understand where they are and what they're doing.  Does Parker actually look forward to his death?  Does Braddock know what he wants to do?  Or is he unsure?The seesawing emotional conflicts that emerge give this film a tense subtle power obviously missing in far too many films today.  Made in 1984, it's a great piece of cinema that is now happily available on DVD.

Dog,"[4, 4]","This is one of my favorite ""unknown"" classics from the 1980's, and one of the few 80's films that managed to cling to the gritty, purposeful aesthetics of the great action films of the 1970's.The plot is simple: A couple of hit men are driving a mob informer to his place of execution. During the trip, tensions arise. What makes this film a beauty, beyond Stephen Frears exuberant, coming-into-his-own direction, is the brilliant casting.John Hurt is a lean, grizzled grim reaper behind a pair of shades. Every word he speaks radiates pure death, and his flat gaze marks whoever it falls upon. Hurt, who has tremendous range as an actor, slips into the role of the killer ""Mr. Braddock"" with a still, icy ease. I have enjoyed Hurt's work for a long time, and I really think he is one of the best character actors in the world. Tim Roth plays Braddock's young sidekick with a combination of cockney attitude and simmering venom. This was Roth's first movie role, and it is all the more remarkable for that reason. Roth is another remarkable craftsman, able to simply dwell in a roll. In an interesting bit of trivia, Hurt and Roth would team up again a decade later in the excellent historical drama, Rob Roy, playing characters in the same kind of deadly symbiotic relationship. These two actors play off one another with expert ease, one the older master (Hurt) and the other the barely controlled apprentice (Roth).The last piece of the acting puzzle is Terrance Stamp, who has had about as strong a mid to late career as an actor could hope for.  He has aged very well, his features hardening into lean stone, much like Clint Eastwood. Stamp plays the mob informer that is going to be hit, and through some amazing acting he is able to portray a kind of transcendental peace that is truly moving.The format for this DVD edition is, to say the least, a disappointment.  The viewing public seems to be far more educated these days than studios and DVD packagers seem to realize.

77268,A1ZKVLM2E00KNU,0784012679,Ryan Agadoni,"[3, 3]","After the long discussion with a friend aboutNo Country for Old Men, I couldn't stop comparing that movie to Stephen Frear's 1984 film The Hit.  Both movies feature cold hit men and both use their characters to explore how people approach death.The basic plot is that a ""supergrass"" (epic stool pigeon, played by Terence Stamp) who squealed on his former boss in exchange for immunity has been captured 10 years later in Spain.  The two hit men, wonderfully played by Tim Roth and John Hurt, are taking him to Paris for execution.  It's a bit of a road trip movie, and a lot happens along the way.  The most important event is when they pick up a young woman named Maggie (Laura del Sol) as a bit of insurance against a colleague ratting them out.Hurt's character (Braddock) is a seemingly emotionless professional hit man who is getting on in years.  He wears dark sunglasses indoors and out, and despite his cool demeanor and professionalism, makes several mistakes.  Roth (Myron) is a new kid, taken along on his first hit as Braddock's protege, eager to prove he has what it takes, yet obviously wet behind the ears and easily manipulated.  Stamp (Willie) walks through the entire movie with a calm acceptance and a bit of playful maliciousness towards his fate and captors.  His demeanor mystifies both Braddock and Myron.  He cites his 10 years of book reading as the foundation for his new outlook on life and death.**spoilers begin with the comparison of Braddock to Chigurh below**Myron thinks he's ready to see death, to deal it, but each time he is given the opportunity he avoids it.  By the end he's not so sure he wants to be a hit man at all.  And, of course, he has no idea when it's coming for him, and his last words as Braddock's bullet goes through his eye are, ""What's this?""Willie has read books about life and death for 10 years, and seems very confident in his understanding of them.  He goes along willingly (after his initial struggle when he is captured) for the entire ride, and even refuses to escape when given the opportunity.  He seems to enjoy being ""above"" everyone else and mischievously causing trouble with Braddock and Myron.  His mischief isn't innocent, either, as he gets a man killed by suggesting to Braddock that a particular man will squeal.  He knew exactly what Braddock would do, and that it wouldn't affect his own fate at all, but he still does it.  Yet, at the very end, when Braddock decides to execute everyone before they've crossed the border, Willie breaks down.  He insists that he was supposed to die in Paris, according to the plan, and runs off, getting shot in the back.  Braddock's response to Willie's change of heart is an incredulous, ""You mouth!""  Willie thought he had learned to accept death, but when he finally came face to face with it, it undid him.  We'll never know how he would have responded had he actually met it in Paris as expected.Braddock is the only figure of the group that actually deals death.  I don't think he represents death as cleanly as Chigurh does, but he is clearly its agent.  He knows he can't escape it forever, so he seems to have resigned himself to being its tool.  He may think that as its agent he has more control over his own time and place.  His puzzlement at Willie's acceptance makes him question his own beliefs about death.  He thought he understood it, but here is a man who doesn't seem to fear it at all.  This causes him to question himself throughout the movie, and make ""mistakes"" that he normally wouldn't have, like sparing Maggie several times.  Even after Willie shows his true colors and shatters the illusion that had been building, Braddock still ultimately spares Maggie, perhaps because she saw it coming and refused to accept it; she even physically fights Braddock on several occasions.  Braddock is perhaps hopeful to retain the tiniest sliver of his humanity by sparing Maggie.  Or, maybe he just respected her will to live.  Minutes later, as he lay dying because of letting Maggie go, he winks at her, and has no choice but to accept his fate.**end spoilers**There's more to it than I've laid out here (I haven't mentioned the stylish production -- location, music, etc.), but that was the most interesting aspect to me, and I'd be curious to hear anyone else's opinion.With regards to the DVD, Criterion has put forth a top-notch effort.

77271,AB8MSE5JHEG97,0784012679,Thomas Plotkin,"[35, 36]","A British gangster turns informer and testifies against a dockful of his mates; as sentence is handed down, the crew gaze at him and burst into song -- Vera Lynn's ""We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when..."" Years later, living a placid exile in a sleepy Spanish village, the informer gets a knock on the door, and two univited guests from his homeland show up; one is a jittery soccer hooligan, the other, is, well, white-suited, sunglasses wearing, and almost silent -- the Angel of Death and his acolyte. Their job is to drive the informer several hundred miles to the French border, where he will be delivered to one of those who vowed revenge and is now free. The catch? The informer goes smilingly and willingly. He has known this day would come, and has spiritually prepared himself for it. As the three journey north, his cheerful composure and penchant for cockeny existentialist philosophizing and non-stop chatter begins to crack the facade of the killers who are transporting him; and then everything starts to go very, very wrong. The question is: Has the informer had a conversion experience, or is he a seasoned hustler who has devised a brilliant survival gambit?Stephen Frears, not yet a hack, directed this fabulous example of BritNoir in the mid-'80's, where it was barely exhibited in the US. The sun-drenched Spanish locations are a special joy, contrasting with the increasingly grim story, and Frears builds up an admirable amount of tension, leading to explosive bursts of orchestrated violence. This film is genuinely unpredictable, thanks in large part to a literate, Pinter-esque script, the fact that the action is character-generated, and three generations of great UK actors are on hand to deliver the crowning glory of the film, its performances, I've saved the best for last:Terence Stamp, in his return to the big screen after a lengthy absence, gives his greatest performance, better even than the much-vaunted ""The Limey,"" as the smiling martyr. His charm and serenity un-nerve his would-be killers, and starts to un-nerve us as well;Tim Roth, in his first feature film, as the soccer hooligan driver on his very first hit; when you see this squirrely apprentice, you know that he is the weak link, and watch how Stamp zeroes right in on him because he sees this too. Watch also how Roth delivers a head-butt as though it was a daily occurrence.The Angel of Death -- John Hurt as the veteran assassin. He is the voluable, handsome, sun-tanned Stamp's polar opposite, he speaks monosyllabically, if at all, will not indulge his captive's fondness for philosophy, and is seemingly oblivious to all but the job at hand. He has no discernable personality, and Hurt, with his dry croak of a voice, shaded eyes, pasty white skin that seems to blanch from the Spanish sun, as though he's not used to daylight, and increasingly filthy white suit, makes him a frightening incarnation, keeping superhuman cool as a simple assignment falls apart and becomes a bloodbath. Not since Charles Bronson in Once Upon a Time in the West have I seen an actor do more with so few lines and an inexpressive visage.Extra credit goes to Laura del Sol, veteran of Carlos Saura's flamenco musicals, as the gorgeous hostage the killers are forced to take on board in one of the film's escalating plot complications: she speaks not a word of English, but she incarnates a will to survive - and an instinctive loathing of the Hurt character - that marks her out as a Mediterranean life force, in contrast to Hurt's Northern European death-drive; just as Stamp's equanimity in the face of death begins to drive the Roth character nuts, her Magnani-like sexuality begins to take its toll on Hurt's impassive murderousness.Anyway, if you want to see a genuine little sleeper of a movie, decked out with a great cast, you could do worse then The Hit. Criterion once again shows fabulous acumen in rescuing a great one from oblivion.
