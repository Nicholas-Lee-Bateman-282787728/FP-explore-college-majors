Ritter,late of The Waltons,Three's Company and Hooperman is Congressman John Hartman who appoints Georgie Lahti(Post) as his personal secretary. Gaynes is another senator and Sperber is a secretary also. Rounding out the cast is Billy Bob Thornton,another congressman. This sitcom led to the longtine friendship between Ritter and Thornton. The pair would later do the films SLING BLADE(written and directed by Thornton) and BAD SANTA(Ritter's last film that was finished shortly before his death). Post wasn't unemployed for long because this series began just after her previous NBC sitcom Night Court got the Nielsen axe. Gaynes was previously a cast member of NBC's Punky Brewster. He also delighted audiences in the six POLICE ACADEMY movies,made one by one between 1983 and 1988. Gaynes also returned for the sixth and most recent sequel POLICE ACADEMY-MISSION TO MOSCOW,released in 1994. Sperber previously played Amy,a friend of the respective characters of Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari on ABC's Bosom Buddies from 1980 to about 1983. This CBS sitcom premiered on September 14,1992 and almost got the Nielsen axe after the first season. This is dedicated to the memory of Ritter who died suddenly of a heart ailment at age 54 in September 2003.

It's really strange to turn on the TV and not find him on somewhere, except in reruns of ""Three's Company.""The release of this TV series on DVD is exciting news for John Ritter fans. For those unfamiliar with it, ""Hearts Afire"" was his 1992-1995 sitcom co-starring Markie Post. John is a senator's aide in Washington, D.C. who is surrounded by funny characters and funny situations. The dialogue is sophisticated and snappy, the chemistry between Ritter and Post is hot, and the supporting players (paticularly the hilarious Conchata Ferrell) couldn't have been better cast.""Hearts Afire"" is notable today because it co-starred a then-unknown actor named Billy Bob Thornton. It should be no surprise that Billy Bob scored many of the show's funniest lines. He stole nearly every scene he was in. It was on this series that Ritter met Billy Bob and the writer/director hired the king of pratfalls against type for what would become one of his most famous roles, the gay man in ""Sling Blade.""If you know this show, you'll be buying this set. If you are unfamiliar with it, rent it. You'll fall in love with it and return here to buy it.Now let's hope other Ritter series and TV movies will also show up on DVD -- with ""Hooperman"" leading the list.",5,Great show deserving a DVD release.,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,1274,"['OK', 'miss', 'John', 'Ritter', 'really', 'strange', 'turn', 'TV', 'not', 'find', 'somewhere', 'reruns', 'Three', 'Company', 'release', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'exciting', 'news', 'John', 'Ritter', 'fans', 'unfamiliar', 'Afire', 'was', '1992-1995', 'sitcom', 'co-starring', 'Markie', 'Post', 'John', 'senator', 'aide', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'who', 'surrounded', 'funny', 'characters', 'funny', 'situations', 'dialogue', 'sophisticated', 'snappy', 'chemistry', 'Ritter', 'Post', 'hot', 'supporting', 'players', 'paticularly', 'hilarious', 'Conchata', 'Ferrell', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'better', 'cast', 'Hearts', 'Afire', 'notable', 'today', 'co-starred', 'then-unknown', 'actor', 'named', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'scored', 'many', 'show', 'funniest', 'lines', 'stole', 'nearly', 'scene', 'was', 'was', 'series', 'Ritter', 'met', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'writer/director', 'hired', 'king', 'pratfalls', 'type', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'famous', 'roles', 'gay', 'man', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'know', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'set', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'rent', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'love', 'return', 'here', 'buy', 'it.Now', 'let', 'hope', 'other', 'Ritter', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'will', 'also', 'show', 'up', 'DVD', 'Hooperman', 'leading', 'list']",Hearts Afire - The First Complete Season
