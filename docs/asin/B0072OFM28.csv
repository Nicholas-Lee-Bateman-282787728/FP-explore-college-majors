They all speak like a cross between british robots and Shakespeare actors . The writers should be fired! Season one and the prequel are very good but this Vengence season did not have the edge of your seat thrill ride like season one or the prequel. The story lines in Vengence were so weak and so was the acting, but then again I'd have to blame it on the writing, which I don't believe the actors could have delivered it any other way. And last but not least, the new Spartacus is not believable at all. He tries to talk like he's authoritative but it comes off as hokey and corny. And what's with everyone having to yell every time they swing a sword? This season left me disappointed.

If you can handle blood, lots of sword fighting, very graphic violence and sex?  Then there is a chance you will love this. That stuff aside, it is about what we all try to enjoy today. Our freedom. Braveheart was the same theme.  Gladiator to a degree the same.  Rome is using people as slaves in gladiator games and hurting and killing them and their families.  Then Spartacus starts a revolution and thousands and thousands of former slaves join his cause. Spartacus had a wife.  The Man in charge of the gladiators killed his wife. it takes him a season to realize it. Then all hell breaks loose and it begins.  Spartacus: Gods of the Arena.  That is a must see.  It is what happened before Spartacus arrived.  The person who was spartacus passed away sadly. Then they had to find the right replacement. while doing so, they made &#34;Gods of the Arena&#34;.  Spartacus Vengeance is just perfect.  It took a while to get use to the new spartacus.  They do look alike so it is really the way they approach the character that separates the two. I loved this series and i just wish they would have gone on for another season or two. If you don't mind violence and almost soft porn sex, you can enjoy the plot, and sub plots and what sparacus is trying to do for his people. He wants freedom for all. And they fight for it.  I did not do this justice.  But i say give this a try.  But you need to start with the first one, then gods of the arena, then Vengeance, then War of the damned.  Four seasons.

Vengeance was disappointing.The season was cut from the expected 13 episodes to 10 episodes, which in my opinion, left it wanting. The writers were not able to develop new characters nor the complex story lines in such a short time frame. They integrated a backstory for Oenomaus with his fate right after the breakout, which was simply confusing and unnecessary in season 2. The intricate and complex relationship between Lucretia and Ilithyia was crammed in between murky battle scenes and never developed to the fullest. The new codependent relationship between Lucretia and Ashur was ""explained"" with a 5 second flashback, which was of no use to anyone (most of us) who had already figured out that Ashur was the only one who could have possibly saved her. The two characters, Sepia and Sepius were so undeveloped that one kept going, ""Who? What? Which one is which? Why are they there?"" up to the point of their demise. An incestual relationship between them was hinted at, but was never developed nor explained. In the last episode, deKnight killed off all of the delicious villains as well as some well-loved good guys, leaving his cast decimated (if I may use that word prior to Crassus being introduced). What we are left with is a rag-tag band of rebels, none of whom are terribly interesting as characters. It does not bode well for season 3, where I suspect the story will leave behind all the wonderful political and sexual intrigue and devolve to a bash and slash fest.On positive note, the one outstanding episode was number 5, which included intrigue, fighting and the spectacular burning of the arena. Yes, I was one of those screaming from my armchair. This episode was directed by Michael Hurst, which I suspect made it the spectacular piece it was. Unfortunately, he directed only this single episode this season.My only comment about the forced cast changes this season is the new actors had big roles to fill and they did well considering the scripts they had to work with.Yes, I pre-ordered the Blu-ray for season 2.

While everyone is entertained by naked men and women, sex and violence( the fight scene choreography is so different from anything else so far put to screen )one thing remains firm--the writing is extraordinary and the acting meets the challenge. The language is near poetry, and the machinations of the characters are endlessly entertaining---equal to the most magnificent show ever on television I Claudius. I miss terribly John Hannah, who stole the show from day one.Yet the most diabolical characters were Lucretia and Ilythia. They will be surely missed in the final season...unless Lucy's producer/creator husband comes up with a twin sister role for her. Yet I think not because the show must leave behind the small venue of Capua to the big arena ( no pun intended )of Italy itself. Even though we lament that the next season will be the last, we must remember the slave rebellion (the Third Servile War )lasted all of two years. Next comes the maneuvering of Roman senators, Crassus, a young Caesar, the Great Pompey, and Metullus, the First Triumverate.The show tries to be historically accurate as possible within the confines of entertainment, which is why we have the figures Crixus, Gannicus, and Onemaues. It was Crixus who disputed strategy with Spartacus, wanting to return to Gaul (modern day France )instead of escaping by sea via the assistance of Cilesian pirates ( who later on were wiped out by Roman fleets under Pompey)and whose success created a burning rivalry with Caesar.Crixus took about twenty thousand with him, headed north and was exterminated by several Roman legions.Later gaining power Crassus was wiped out by being surrounded by a Parthian host and lost sixty thousand legionnaires.Inadvertenly Spartacus was partially responsible for the decline and end of the Roman Republic.......As far as the conversation of Liam replacing Andy, I had no problem with it because after just rewatching the first season it came to me that Liam had a stronger screen presence than Andy and finer oratory skills and voice quality.Anxiously awaiting season two on dvd and Blu ray and watching the final season next spring.Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series",5,sure gonna miss Lucretia and Ilythia,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,2347,"['series', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'glued', 'eyes', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'shows', 'great', 'just', 'better', 'week', 'everyone', 'entertained', 'naked', 'men', 'women', 'sex', 'violence', 'fight', 'scene', 'choreography', 'so', 'different', 'anything', 'else', 'so', 'far', 'put', 'screen', 'one', 'thing', 'firm', 'writing', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'meets', 'challenge', 'language', 'near', 'poetry', 'machinations', 'characters', 'are', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', '-equal', 'most', 'magnificent', 'show', 'ever', 'television', 'Claudius', 'miss', 'terribly', 'John', 'Hannah', 'who', 'stole', 'show', 'day', 'most', 'diabolical', 'characters', 'were', 'Lucretia', 'Ilythia', 'will', 'be', 'surely', 'missed', 'final', 'season', 'Lucy', 'producer/creator', 'husband', 'up', 'twin', 'sister', 'role', 'think', 'not', 'show', 'must', 'leave', 'small', 'venue', 'Capua', 'big', 'arena', 'pun', 'intended', 'Italy', 'Even', 'lament', 'next', 'season', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'must', 'remember', 'slave', 'rebellion', 'Third', 'Servile', 'War', 'lasted', 'two', 'years', 'Next', 'maneuvering', 'Roman', 'senators', 'Crassus', 'young', 'Caesar', 'Great', 'Pompey', 'Metullus', 'First', 'Triumverate.The', 'show', 'be', 'historically', 'accurate', 'possible', 'confines', 'entertainment', 'why', 'have', 'figures', 'Crixus', 'Gannicus', 'Onemaues', 'was', 'Crixus', 'who', 'disputed', 'strategy', 'Spartacus', 'wanting', 'return', 'Gaul', 'modern', 'day', 'France', 'instead', 'escaping', 'sea', 'assistance', 'Cilesian', 'pirates', 'who', 'later', 'were', 'wiped', 'out', 'Roman', 'fleets', 'Pompey', 'success', 'created', 'burning', 'rivalry', 'Caesar.Crixus', 'took', 'about', 'twenty', 'thousand', 'headed', 'north', 'was', 'exterminated', 'several', 'Roman', 'legions.Later', 'gaining', 'power', 'Crassus', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'being', 'surrounded', 'Parthian', 'host', 'lost', 'sixty', 'thousand', 'legionnaires.Inadvertenly', 'Spartacus', 'was', 'partially', 'responsible', 'decline', 'end', 'Roman', 'Republic', '.As', 'far', 'conversation', 'Liam', 'replacing', 'Andy', 'had', 'problem', 'just', 'rewatching', 'first', 'season', 'came', 'Liam', 'had', 'stronger', 'screen', 'presence', 'Andy', 'finer', 'oratory', 'skills', 'voice', 'quality.Anxiously', 'awaiting', 'season', 'two', 'dvd', 'Blu', 'ray', 'watching', 'final', 'season', 'next', 'spring.Bloodspiller', 'Book', 'One', 'Warriors', 'Palahia', 'Series']",N/A

1524869,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B0072OFM28,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[4, 5]","Powerful and unforgettable -- these are the two words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe ""Spartacus: Vengeance.""  The first one tells you about how hard it hits you while watching it and the second one is the feeling that you have after watching it. Hell, for that matter, I shall also add a third word: addictive - you just can't get enough. And if you thought that the first two installments of the series, ""Spartacus: Gods of the Arena"" and ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"" could not be surpassed, think again. The writers keep it excitingly fresh and honest.After two seasons, for a lack of a better word (""Spartacus Vengeance"" is labeled as the second season), we now find Spartacus and his fellow slaves free, after terminating Batiatus' empire. If you recall, Batiatus (John Hannah) was the mighty owner of the best gladiators in the town of Capua. However, even though the gladiators are free, they are still slaves and the Romans will do anything to get them back. This time, the Roman-in- charge and the new owner of the Batiatus house is Glaber (Craig Parker, who does a great job). Glaber, as we know, is married to Ilithyia (Viva Bianca), who barely escaped the wrath of Spartacus and his followers when they ended Batiatus' regime. In addition, it is also known that Spartacus, who was originally played by Andy Whitfield, who died at the height of his career due to cancer, was replaced by Liam McIntyre. He commands an impressive group of gladiators and slaves - both male and females --, including Crixus (Manu Bennett), Doctore (Peter Mensah), Mira (Katrina Law), Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel), and others. Spartacus keeps freeing and recruiting slaves throughout the region, always telling his people that ""an empty hand can yet become a fist"" and ""even the mighty republic bleeds when stricken.""  Of course, along the way we will find new faces and the return of older ones who we thought were gone for good. There are also mutinies within Spartacus' troops, and all is done well. My favorite episode is ""Libertus,"" number five of the season, which by itself could have been a movie. I couldn't believe my eyes while watching it and I was at the edge of my seat. What suspense! What a show! The final and tenth episode, ""Wrath of the Gods,"" is also as good as it gets, and closes the season in a satisfying and majestic manner.""Spartacus Vengeance"" has elements of ""Apocalypse Now,"" Hitchcock, James Bond, ""The Godfather,"" ""Caligula"" (Tinto Brass' version), and more; you can see the influences on the filmmakers. The violence gets more gruesome (if that is possible) and the sex is more graphic, without being x-rated (or NR-rated?), and I have to confess that, even though I am not a fan of today's brand of violence (especially the new wave of horror movies), this series is my guilty pleasure. Ah, of course there is also the nudity - male and female - which is a delight to any sexual preference. And then there is the matter of Liam McIntyre replacing Andy Whitfield. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it, as the action and plot keeps you busy. However, that said, I was surprised by Viva Bianca's incredible range of acting on this particular season. I was also impressed by Katrina Law, who was a perfect partner for Spartacus. Both of them, I believe, stole the show from the others, including the males.  Now, of course, we have to wait for what is supposed to be the final season of this spectacular series: ""War of the Damned.""  Knowing Spartacus' end in real life, according to history and in Stanley Kubrick's film, is kind of hard to just think about it, and I hope that the filmmakers have the wisdom on how to give the series a great closure. A hint of that end is given in one of the episodes. The DVD edition includes the season's ten episodes, Starz studios used for Spartacus, a making-of feature, bloopers, a teaser for  ""Spartacus: War of the Damned,"" and much more.

I'm a big fan and was devastated when I heard Andy Whitfield was ill and then died.  He was perfect for this role.  He was awesome. The new guy is doing ok.  If he was the original Spartacus I'm thinking we'd all be saying he's awesome but Andy set such a high bar I don't think anybody could have matched or bettered him.  Anyway.  Season 2 in my opinion is a little different to season 1 for me.  I liked seeing the gladiators being trained, fighting in the area and seeing the twisted plots unfold in the house of Batiatus.  Now that season 2 is out in the open with so many different locatnions it's obviously not the same.  However, season 2 has got better and better with each episode.  Last Fridays.... I think episode 5... was the best episode yet!  I was yelling OMG! and my girlfriend was screaming!!!  really she was.  When Ganacus comes back and enters the arena only to fight against....????? I was shocked!  But there was so many other jaw dropping moments in this episode the 59 minutes(?) just flew by. I was mentally drained.... how often can you say that after watching a show?!  It was like seeing Star Wars in 1977.... you left the theatre thinking 'wow... did I just see what I think I did....no way!' and then you'd talk to everybody you knew about it for weeks and weeks....  well my work colleagues will be getting an ear full tomorrow.  This last episode was that good!This show continues to amaze me.  Half way through the season and the characters are all in place, the plots are thickening and you know the twists are coming too.

The actor they got to play Spartacus, is too American. He has the presence and somewhat the look, but not the voice. His voice has the undertone of a different region and that is kind of distracting.

It's good to see most of the other main characters return.  Spartacus is still an awesome show with lots of action and drama.  Sometimes they go a little overboard with the blood.  For example, someone gets headbutted or a minor cut with a sword and a gallon of blood comes flying out.  I'd rather see it a little more realistic, but then again this is an over-the-top show.

Every show is one excuse after the other to start a fight. Blood and gore, for any reason whatsoever. I loved last season, but this one was utterly sadistic to the point of discomfort and uneasiness. It starts getting really bad around episode five. The actor cast to replace Spartacus does a fine job, but the dialogue and writing failed him, as it did the other characters. The actress that replaced Naevia from season one, due to contract issues, is vastly inferior to her, acting-wise. She is so terrible, it takes the viewer out of the show. The writing is so bad, that all the characters are mere shadows of the season one self. It almost seems like this show has ignored its classy fans in favor of the UFC/WWE element this season. The show is, as I've heard others describe, now a Saturday Morning Cartoon. There are numerous, illogical encounters between Spartacus and the main villain this season, Glaber, almost like how Megatron and Optimus Prime used to duke it out in their various respective cartoon versions of the years. To add insult to injury, the show added a mute, invincible villain named The Egyptian, whose main purpose in the show probably is to appeal to junior high boys and sell toys.The IQ of this show has dropped so much from past seasons. Anyone longing for the complex, adult plot and writing from Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena will be disappointed so much, it will be like getting smacked by the hilt of Crixus's sword. From what I read from various comments around the internet, the season finale was the last straw for many viewers. It was ridiculous. There were several jump the shark moments. While there was one scene that struck me as disgusting and sick, it was the lone bright spot of the finale, if not the season, but it will haunt you for days to come. What happens in that scene, was also the reason many fans have decided to quit this show.Do like I did; forget this season ever existed and cherish your copies of Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena.

1524932,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B0072OFM28,Jack E. Levic,"[0, 0]","SPARTACUS:VENGEANCE is a production of epic and monumental proportions. There is nothing even remotely like it on TV. The lavish sets and  visual effects are beyond description.Although it is billed as the SECOND SEASON of SPARTACUS, fans will know it is technically the third season. When Spartacus star Andy Whitfied took ill, STARZ kept the series alive by doing a prequel showing the House of Batiatus before the arrival of Spartacus. Everyone hoped Whitfield would recover and return to the sadly. Sadly, he lost his battle on September 11, 2011.VENGEANCE takes us to 6 weeks after the massacre that ended Season One. Liam McIntyre has replaced Whitfield as Spartacus. McIntyre looks a lot like Whitfield although a bit younger. The transition works and the series is kept alive. The fantastic Lucy Lawless is back as Lucretia in her her conniving evilness. It's a violent and volatile time in the Roman Empire and the slaves and gladiators of the House of Batiatus are out for revenge and justice.Despite the murder of his beloved wife and his enslavement, the Spartacus of Vengeance takes the high ground morally. His desire for revenge is directed to Gaius Claudius Glaber but there is no desire to seek revenge from innocent people. This ease to constant disagreement among Spartacus and the men and women in his group. The ranks of the freed slaves grow and the band becomes a very real threat to the Roman Empire.This is an amazing show but be warned. It is not for the squeamish or those who are easily offended. It's definitely not a show for the whole family. The bloodbath and novel ways of killing people never ends. The sex can be rather explicit but this was ancient Rome afterall. The show reaches new levels of bloodspurting wounds. The killings and blood move in poetic slow motion. Visual Effects are advancing at an almost daily rate and the show takes advantage of being able to show more blood and gore.The effects are stunning and the destruction of the arena is the most incredible visual effects I have ever seen on TV. It cannot be missed.It was an amazing and violent time in the world and the producer strive for authenticity along with their fantasy.History tells us that a man named Spartacus did lead a slave revolt around 70 BC. Records tell little about him,  but it is interesting to know that this series is based on a real person and real events that obviously have been fictionalized because of the lack of historical documentation.The cast is absolutely amazing. I enjoy the fact that shows set in ancient Rome add an authenticity by having actors speak British English. The ruling class and wealthy speak a more posh English while lower classes speak a working class British English. Somehow it all works. A ""new"" language and manner of speaking is created to represent the latin-speaking Romans.Liam McIntyre does a fine job in his role as Spartacus. It must have been difficult to fill Andy Whitfield's shoes. The end of episode one's credits leaves us with a picture of Whitfield as a memorial. He is never mentioned again even in the bonus features. Maybe the tragedy of his death was too dark to even mention on this show.VENGEANCE is loaded with special features that are a must see to fans of the show. It is amazing to see how the visual effects were created and how the sets were built. The explanation of how the arena was destroyed cannot be missed. Again, this is something I have never seen before and it was remarkable.I love this show but it definitely is not for everyone. It's the kind of show some people will love and others will turn away in disgust from the blood and violence. Whatever your opinion is of the story, VENGEANCE is a remarkable example of how a talented cast and crew and visual effects can recreate a remarkable time in history.",5,STYLIZED BLOOS AND GOREFEST REACHES NEW LEVEL,1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,3807,"['SPARTACUS', 'VENGEANCE', 'production', 'epic', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'TV', 'lavish', 'sets', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'billed', 'SECOND', 'SEASON', 'SPARTACUS', 'fans', 'will', 'know', 'technically', 'third', 'season', 'When', 'Spartacus', 'star', 'Andy', 'Whitfied', 'took', 'ill', 'STARZ', 'kept', 'series', 'alive', 'doing', 'prequel', 'showing', 'House', 'Batiatus', 'arrival', 'Spartacus', 'Everyone', 'hoped', 'Whitfield', 'would', 'recover', 'return', 'sadly', 'Sadly', 'lost', 'battle', 'September', '11', '2011.VENGEANCE', '6', 'weeks', 'massacre', 'ended', 'Season', 'One', 'Liam', 'McIntyre', 'replaced', 'Whitfield', 'Spartacus', 'McIntyre', 'lot', 'Whitfield', 'bit', 'younger', 'transition', 'series', 'kept', 'alive', 'fantastic', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'back', 'Lucretia', 'conniving', 'evilness', 'violent', 'volatile', 'time', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'slaves', 'gladiators', 'House', 'Batiatus', 'are', 'out', 'revenge', 'justice.Despite', 'murder', 'beloved', 'wife', 'enslavement', 'Spartacus', 'Vengeance', 'high', 'ground', 'morally', 'desire', 'revenge', 'directed', 'Gaius', 'Claudius', 'Glaber', 'desire', 'seek', 'revenge', 'innocent', 'people', 'ease', 'constant', 'disagreement', 'Spartacus', 'men', 'women', 'group', 'ranks', 'freed', 'grow', 'band', 'very', 'real', 'threat', 'Roman', 'Empire.This', 'amazing', 'show', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'squeamish', 'who', 'are', 'easily', 'offended', 'definitely', 'not', 'show', 'whole', 'family', 'bloodbath', 'novel', 'ways', 'killing', 'people', 'never', 'sex', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'explicit', 'was', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'afterall', 'show', 'new', 'levels', 'bloodspurting', 'wounds', 'killings', 'blood', 'move', 'poetic', 'slow', 'motion', 'Visual', 'Effects', 'are', 'advancing', 'almost', 'daily', 'rate', 'show', 'advantage', 'being', 'able', 'show', 'more', 'blood', 'gore.The', 'effects', 'are', 'stunning', 'destruction', 'arena', 'most', 'incredible', 'visual', 'effects', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'TV', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed.It', 'was', 'amazing', 'violent', 'time', 'world', 'producer', 'strive', 'authenticity', 'fantasy.History', 'tells', 'man', 'named', 'Spartacus', 'did', 'lead', 'slave', 'revolt', '70', 'BC', 'Records', 'tell', 'little', 'interesting', 'know', 'series', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'events', 'obviously', 'have', 'been', 'fictionalized', 'lack', 'historical', 'documentation.The', 'cast', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'set', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'add', 'authenticity', 'having', 'actors', 'speak', 'British', 'English', 'ruling', 'class', 'wealthy', 'speak', 'more', 'posh', 'English', 'lower', 'classes', 'speak', 'working', 'class', 'British', 'English', 'Somehow', 'new', 'language', 'manner', 'speaking', 'created', 'represent', 'latin-speaking', 'Romans.Liam', 'McIntyre', 'fine', 'job', 'role', 'Spartacus', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'fill', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'shoes', 'end', 'episode', 'one', 'credits', 'picture', 'Whitfield', 'memorial', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'even', 'bonus', 'features', 'Maybe', 'tragedy', 'death', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'even', 'mention', 'show.VENGEANCE', 'loaded', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'show', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'created', 'how', 'sets', 'were', 'built', 'explanation', 'how', 'arena', 'was', 'destroyed', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Again', 'something', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'was', 'remarkable.I', 'show', 'definitely', 'not', 'everyone', 'kind', 'show', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'others', 'will', 'turn', 'away', 'disgust', 'blood', 'violence', 'opinion', 'story', 'VENGEANCE', 'remarkable', 'example', 'how', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', 'visual', 'effects', 'can', 'recreate', 'remarkable', 'time', 'history']",N/A
1524933,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0072OFM28,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[9, 12]","The most obvious complaint one could broach about this third season of SPARTACUS (subtitled VENGEANCE) is the portrayal of the titular character by Liam McIntyre. Most fans are still not yet removed far enough from the terribly tragic passing of Andy Whitfield, who played the character with perfection. Most haters of this season say that McIntyre is just not on the same level as Whitfield. Is there truth to that? I think that there is, but it's less about McIntyre's actual abilities as an actor, which are considerable, and more about how much we miss Andy. Liam had some huge shoes to fill, and he knew going in that he was going to get a lot of flak from fans of the show.Now, I'm not the biggest fan of this series there ever was, but I will admit to my addiction to it. I find this season similarly entertaining and similarly predictible to the first two ""seasons"" of this show, but I was surprised to find that once Liam had been in a few episodes, I felt that it easily could have been him all along, which is certainly NO disrespect to Andy. I will also admit that McIntyre is a little wooden and not as emotional as Whitfield's Spartacus, but that is because this season holds less for Spartacus from an emotional standpoint than BLOOD AND SAND did. Part of Spartacus is already dead in this season, not only through the way that his relationship with Mira is portrayed, but also through his disregard of his own life as he seeks to strike at Glaber in any way he can. The role, and not McIntyre, is wooden. This is what's demanded of him; a role as steel-and-battle-forged leader to the fugitivus he now commands that look to him for leadership and counsel. Solemnity is required of the role now. That, and the uncanny ability to cleave head from Roman neck with a single blow.What is also a common complaint is that this show, while being extremely entertaining, rarely gives us anything that is truly surprising. We have a set amount of characters that we know nothing is going to happen to, and everyone else is pretty much the equivalent to a STAR TREK ""red shirt"". If we get to know them at all, it's for about five minutes. This is true. The show is very formulaic, but when it does break out the surprises, they're pretty mouth-gaping.Another common complaint is that this is essentially a mashup of Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR, Zack Snyder's 300, and HBO's brilliant ROME... with a heaping helping of late-night Cinemax for good measure. If you're coming to this show for truly original entertainment, you've looked at the wrong place. There is much politicking in this show, but not as clever or as strongly written as ROME. There is also a feeling that this show acquired its entire visual aesthetic from 300 with a lot or fast-slow-fast fights, dark-light-dark color palette and lots of slo-mo explosions of blood. This is true as well and I invite debate on that point (but only civil debate, please). And as far as GLADIATOR goes... well, that's just from a plot standpoint and somewhat rehashed plot is hardly worth criticism.Another common complaint was that of a new Naevia, played not by Leslie-Ann Brandt, but Cynthia Addai-Robinson. This is a much different Naevia than was portrayed before, and with good reason. But the skill is there and she makes a fine addition to the cast.Another common complaint is the dialogue which seems unnatural and overly polished with poetic license. To that I say... close mouth. This is a highly stylized show and it greatly benefits from having equally stylized dialogue.I don't think that any of the great creative minds that created this series, from Steven S.

The band of outlaws now hides underground and strikes fear into the hearts of Capua's citizens. Gaius Glaber and his troops are sent to quell the rebellion. With such a powerful enemy, Spartacus and his men will need some luck, cunning, and the help of some unlikely allies. The epic story continues. The blood flows, and the passion burns hotter than ever in the 3rd season of Spartacus.This series is nothing less than incredible. As most of us know, Andy Whitfield passed away not so long ago. It was his unforgettable performance that launched this series. his absence is why this season deserves 4 stars. It lacks a powerful lead character, but boasts a superb supporting cast. Even without his unparallelled performance, Spartacus still remains a spectacle. The reasons for this are a strong supporting cast, and an engrossing story. The new Spartacus is a shadow of Andy Whitfield, he lacks the passion and charisma that his predecessor displayed. This show remains as powerful as a freight train with no brakes. Propelled by the fire that Andy Whitfield started not so many years ago. If you enjoyed the other 2 season, you will probably find Vengeance to be exciting as well.

Life was short and brutal for many and they did not get caught up on the same mores as today. (For example, in the first show Solonius stops in the middle of the street and defacates at a public toilet right next to the man that he'd been conversing with.  If I recall, the attendant wiped his arse for coin!) Also, if you look around, there are more displays of breasts because there's an equal number of leading women and hand maidens. Are you so blind that you cannot see the areola beneath the women's shear dresses?  In sum, wether you favor women or men, there is plenty to enjoy.  And unless you are dimwit, that is what the writers meant to do, in addition to following some historical guidance.  FWIW, I hear that in Roman times the phallus was a powerful symbol.  Even in HBOs 'Rome' households and street walls had statues and graffiti (a word from that period) of penises.  In sum, sort out your facts or just do not watch the show.  Lastly, Andy Whitfield passed away, and filling his shoes is no easy matter. Mr. McIntyre carries the character and the dialogue very well.

Also, the point of this review is to help inform people who like the show, but have not watched this season as of yet, of the changes between this season and seasons past.There are a few notable differences between Vengeance and its predecessors. Most notably, Andy Whitefield has been replaced by another actor due to his untimely death. I feel that this change, while unavoidable, was a major detraction. The emotion of the character, Spartacus, is just not on the same level as Andy's performance. Aside from the lead actor, another prominent role has been re-cast, and again not for the better. Naevea has been replaced by someone who is once again, not right for the role. The scenes between her and Crixus have even made me not like his charatcer this season.In addition to the bad acting and bad casting, the writing seems to have gone WAY downhill. What brought this about I do not know. All I do know is that this season is a MAJOR disappointment to myself, and I know more than a few others. Judging by the four star average on here, people seem to have liked this season, but I felt I needed to add my own opinion on Vengeance.

Lee ""rleehistory""","[2, 3]","The problem with the second season of Spartacus is that since the Romans and the gladiators are no longer living under the same roof, every episode is effectively divided up into Roman scenes and gladiator scenes, and their is no question which are more interesting. The cruel, scheming, ambitious Romans remain endlessly watchable, whereas the gladiators when left to themselves do nothing but engage in endless debates about the meaning of freedom and the conduct of war. Which would you rather watch, a roomful of drunken, sex-craved Roman aristocrats torturing a captured ex-slave to death by flaying him alive, or a roomful of ex-gladiators debating the ethics of slave rebellion? The gladiators only come to life when in direct conflict with the Romans, as in the spectacular immolation of the arena in Capua (a superb sequence) or in titillating episodes like the one in which Spartacus and his men invade a brothel and impale all the naked customers on their swords as the victims' backsides wriggle (in close up), their private parts flop about (ditto), and the television screen is covered in gore.The problem is not the actors, all of whom do their best. The problem is that the writers have a habit of confusing their series with the classic Kirk Douglas movie, wanting to infuse it with some of that old epic's high moral seriousness. It doesn't work. The sermonizing is hard to take in a series like this. Spartacus the TV series (NOT Spartacus the movie) is essentially high gloss soft porn dignified by some remarkably intelligent acting and superb production values. (I could watch Lucy Lawless smirk and glower for hours without becoming bored.) To be honest, I'm more interested in Spartacus the half-naked crazed killer than in Spartacus the philosopher. (There is also a serious plausibility problem. How did all these brutalized trained killers turn into Thomas Jeffersons?)At it's best, Spartacus remains tremendous fun and I'm looking forward to the final season. I just hope their will be more sex and gore, and less moral posturing. Nevertheless, I have to conclude by stating that since all of the most interesting characters are dead now, I have no idea how the writers are going to pull it off.",4,The Embarrassing Tedium of Goodness,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,2223,"['problem', 'second', 'season', 'Spartacus', 'Romans', 'gladiators', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'same', 'roof', 'episode', 'effectively', 'divided', 'up', 'Roman', 'scenes', 'gladiator', 'scenes', 'question', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'cruel', 'scheming', 'ambitious', 'Romans', 'remain', 'endlessly', 'watchable', 'gladiators', 'when', 'left', 'do', 'nothing', 'engage', 'endless', 'debates', 'meaning', 'freedom', 'conduct', 'war', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'roomful', 'drunken', 'sex-craved', 'Roman', 'torturing', 'captured', 'ex-slave', 'death', 'flaying', 'alive', 'roomful', 'ex-gladiators', 'debating', 'ethics', 'slave', 'rebellion', 'gladiators', 'only', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'direct', 'conflict', 'Romans', 'spectacular', 'immolation', 'arena', 'Capua', 'superb', 'sequence', 'titillating', 'episodes', 'one', 'Spartacus', 'men', 'invade', 'brothel', 'impale', 'naked', 'customers', 'swords', 'victims', 'backsides', 'wriggle', 'close', 'private', 'parts', 'flop', 'ditto', 'television', 'screen', 'covered', 'gore.The', 'problem', 'not', 'actors', 'whom', 'do', 'best', 'problem', 'writers', 'have', 'habit', 'confusing', 'series', 'classic', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'movie', 'wanting', 'infuse', 'old', 'epic', 'high', 'moral', 'seriousness', ""n't"", 'work', 'sermonizing', 'hard', 'take', 'series', 'Spartacus', 'TV', 'series', 'NOT', 'Spartacus', 'movie', 'essentially', 'high', 'gloss', 'soft', 'porn', 'dignified', 'remarkably', 'intelligent', 'acting', 'superb', 'production', 'values', 'could', 'watch', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'smirk', 'glower', 'hours', 'becoming', 'bored', 'be', 'honest', ""'m"", 'more', 'interested', 'Spartacus', 'half-naked', 'crazed', 'killer', 'Spartacus', 'philosopher', 'also', 'serious', 'plausibility', 'problem', 'How', 'did', 'brutalized', 'trained', 'killers', 'turn', 'Thomas', 'Jeffersons', 'best', 'Spartacus', 'tremendous', 'fun', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'final', 'season', 'just', 'hope', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'sex', 'gore', 'less', 'moral', 'posturing', 'Nevertheless', 'have', 'conclude', 'stating', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'are', 'dead', 'now', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'writers', 'are', 'going', 'pull', 'off']",N/A

1525005,A2TOXBTDH3Y6R9,B0072OFM28,Rich H.,"[48, 55]","Fans ofSpartacus: Blood and Sandand the prequelGods of the Arena: Draw near, that I may break words with you.Know this in advance: there are parts of this second season (or third, depending on how you're counting) of the Spartacus saga that _you will not like_.  But the gods do not favor such thoughts!  WE are for Spartacus: Vengeance, preferably on Blu-ray, which has had noticeably better picture and sound quality than the Starz broadcasts.  Bend ear, and I shall give good reasons to make purchase:- The story is on a par with, possibly even better than, Blood and Sand.  It's different - how could it be otherwise? - but more complex and on a much grander scale. The same goes for the setting. Spartacus has always featured impressive camera work and CGI, and this time around it is, at times, literally jaw-dropping and downright beautiful. Much of S:V looks and feels more like a movie than a TV series.- The cast outdoes itself yet again. Liam McIntyre takes a couple of episodes to get comfortable with the daunting job of filling Andy Whitfield's sandals, but by mid-season he's rocking Spartacus every bit as hard as Whitfield did.  Cynthia Addai-Robinson takes awhile to get into her role as Naevia (replacing Leslie-Ann Brandt,) but makes up for it and then some in the final episode. All the returnees own their characters in splendid fashion, even when those characters have dramatically changed (see below.)  It's very hard to pick a standout this time, but I'm going with Nick Tarabay. Yeah, Asher, who this time around is pushing his intelligence (he's smarter than he appears) and cunning (he's even more of a snake) to their limits in an attempt to gain real wealth and power.  Tarabay takes what was a relatively minor character in the other series and brings him to the forefront as a downright fascinating, and in a way even tragic, figure.  Where was he hiding this guy in S:B&S;?- Lucy Lawless, who takes her character Lucretia on a horrific roller-coaster ride from wife and house-mistress (with a touch of the Borgia thrown in,) to mad prophetess, to a vengeful slave's plaything, to confidante-and-perhaps-assassin of a powerful family.  You'll be genuinely wondering whether she's crazy-like-a-fox, or just plain crazy, right up to the moment of the Stephen King-worthy climax in the final episode.- ""Libertus"".  Spartacus and his generals return to the arena in Capua one final time, and the result is the best episode of any of the three series up until this point.  This and the season finale are by themselves worth the price of the entire set.- ""Wrath of the Gods"".  I didn't think it was possible to top the finale of Blood and Sand.  They did it.- The bonus features are all worth watching, especially the ""making of"" episode 5 featurette.  For someone who still pictures the lights-camera-action Hollywood stereotype behind the scenes, watching 21st-century state-of-the-art ""filming"" with its complex battle choreography, robotic digital cameras and virtual sets is endlessly fascinating.To be sure, there are a few problems with S:V:- First and foremost: only ten episodes.  The whole blasted thing was over and done with inside of three months. And this is weird, because there is easily 13 episodes worth of story here. As others have noted, this means that a number of intriguing plot threads (e.g. Lucretia's rescue from the ludus massacre, and the Seppia / Seppius relationship) were just barely touched upon.  I assume they blew the budget on episodes 5 and 10, but still, ten episodes simply were not enough to tell this story as it should be told.- As with S:GotA, the story starts out slow, taking a couple of episodes to ramp up.  Clearly the producers' fault for spoiling us with S:B&S;, which was solid from end to end. ;)- It's clear at this point that the producers are making a conscious effort to outdo themselves sex-and-violence-wise with each new season, and in S:V it's actually become a detriment to the show.  We now have the camera lingering on spilled intestines and increasingly-bizarre mutilations for no other reason than ""Hey, look what our effects guys came up with THIS time!""  We also have numerous scenes set in a brothel that clearly exist only to (ahem) insert sex that they couldn't work into the storyline. (This season could have been subtitled ""Meanwhile, back at the whorehouse..."")  S:B&S; proved that they can use the sex and gore intelligently to pump up an already good story.  So why go all gratuitous on us now?- Ten. Episodes.  At a higher price than most other series' 22-episode seasons.  (If history is any guide, however, the price will come down soon after release.)Sum of topic: Buy it, but wait until the price comes down somewhat.  Five stars, but just barely this time - the length, the price and what is now the almost overbearing sex and gore almost cost it that 5th.",5,"By Jupiter's.....beard, they've done it

It is nonstop slaughter and sexual depravity.  Skin is torn, skulls cleaved, limbs hacked off, abdomens impaled, necks pierced, intestines drawn out ad infinitum.

1525020,AVEAF1857NCYR,B0072OFM28,"Sean Brodrick ""Commodities SuperCyclist""","[6, 8]","I watched the 10-episode season of Spartacus: Vengeance. What an amazing story. I won't give too many spoilers, but in many ways, this is the best season of Spartacus yet.If you're new to the series, you can start with Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. That's the prequel they filmed when series star Andy Whitfield got sick.Andy had filmed the original series, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, which got everything off to an impressive start. Co-stars John Hannah and Lucy Lawless were brilliant, the entire cast was top-notch, and the story-line was epic. Blood and Sand ends in a rebellion that claims the lives of Hannah's and Lawless' characters, and the story was set to boil over into the next season.Then Whitfield came down with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He took time off to fight his disease. In a stroke of genius, the show's creators decided to show what happened at the gladiator school BEFORE Spartacus arrived. We were introduced to MORE amazing actors and characters, and Hannah and Lawless got to explore depths of their treacherous yet devoted characters that are some of the best roles written for anybody - ever. Gods of the Arena is really the story of Hannah and Lawless' characters, and their incredible scheming.Sadly, Whitfield lost his battle with lymphoma. So when it came time to cast the next season, Spartacus: Vengeance, the show's producers picked Liam McIntyre, who looks a lot like Andy. Stunt-casting like that usually fails, and Liam plays a more warm, less cold-blooded Spartacus. This will rub some viewers as wrong, but if you accept that personal growth is a big part of the story, it actually works.Spartacus: Vengeance takes place after the events of Spartacus: Blood and Sand so is called ""season 2"" in a move that will confuse many viewers. The producers sweetened the plot by bringing back Lucy Lawless' character, Lucretia. Though she seemed dead at the end of ""Blood and Sand,"" they found a way to bring her back, totally mad after the events that saw her house, marriage and life ruined.Spartacus: Vengeance tells the story of the early stage of the Spartacan rebellion, or Third Servile War. And there is enough intrigue, back-stabbing, and plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you liked Lucretica's scheming, just wait till you see what Ilithyia, played by Viva Bianca, gets up to. The ending is both horrific and satisfying, and makes this the role of Lucy Lawless' career. Xena, Shmeena!Vengeance is a season in which most characters ask themselves: ""What's next?""  For Spartacus, it's ""What's next after I pull off a slave rebellion?"" His answer is a quest to find love with Mira (maybe) and definitely vengeance on Glaber, the Roman senator who first hired him as a mercenary then sold Spartacus and his wife into slavery.for loyal Crixus, what's next is to find redemption saving Naevia -- their illicit love ended with her being sent off to the mines.  Crixus is obsessed with freeing her.For Doctore/Oenomaus, what's next is how to find honor after he's lost it all. We learn Oenomaus' backstory. You thought maybe you learned his history in the prequel, Gods of the Arena.  There's a lot more to the man.For Gannicus, the freed gladiator, what's next is finding something to live for.  His character has been adrift since Gods of the Arena. Can Spartacus inspire Gannicus with new purpose?You probably know that Spartacus is based on a real person, though very little is known about him. Gannicus, Crixus and Oenomaus were all real gladiator/rebels as well. One change is that in real life, Oenomaus was a Gaul; they make him a Nubian for the series so they could use Peter Mensah, a martial arts master who is also a masterful actor.And I have to mention actor Nick Tarabay, who plays scheming gladiator and all-around scumbag Ashur. He's not a historical figure, but seems modeled after the character Aaron from Titus Andronicus; the character who boasted:""I have done a thousand dreadful thingsAs willingly as one would kill a fly,And nothing grieves me heartily indeedBut that I cannot do ten thousand more""Speaking of Shakespeare, the language of TV's Spartacus will seem Shakepearean at times. To get that effect, the writers translated Roman texts -- words and phrases -- literally and incorporated them into the scripts. The language really helps transport you to another time.If you liked Rome, if you liked the Sopranos, consider TV's Spartacus. The show is not for kids or even teens, or anyone with a weak stomach.

1525024,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B0072OFM28,Sky,"[129, 141]","First, for those that may not have seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD based on its popularity, Spartacus: Vengeance is season 2 of the show but technically the third season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the titleSpartacus: Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.The prequel was calledGods of the Arenaand it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. So for season 2 we get Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there is something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; he's a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much (and a bit smaller; he had to look up to most of his warrior co-stars). And that took away some of the believability from season 2 for me....Especially when Spartacus would break into one of his many inspirational and emotional speeches to his group of freedom fighters. It was the non-battle scenes that I was often struck by the notion that 'the real' Spartacus is gone.So was season 2 good? Was it maybe even great? It had some great moments for sure, but had some very big shoes to fill after season 1's finale. Some of the season 2 supporting characters were certainly not as strong as season 1's. The unexpected return of Lucy Lawless definitely helped, but as good as it made the final episode of season 1, I think that the studio was ultimately kicking itself for killing off John Hannah who carried all of Gods of the Arena and co-starred more than he supported many of the Blood and Sand season episodes. (Don't worry: If you're new to the series and you watch the shows in time chronologically with Gods of the Arena first, that tidbit of info about killing off John Hannah is spoiled in the first few moments of episode 1 of Gods even though Hannah stars throughout; so thank the studio for that, not me.)Similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus Vengeance leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory.

As for season 2 review , it got off on a slow start. first getting used to a new main star  . and second missing Andy Whitfield in the part. With the other shows that Starz had on tv such as CAMALOT an MAGIC CITY  , both flopped . Starz lost a big gamble trying to keep up with the big boy HBO an lost . It shows by what movies they keep repeating without any new ones . Too bad that SPARTACUS , had to suffer for this bad programing problem, cuz an actor worked His life away trying to make us happy an wanted to keep it going after He died. BLOOD AND SANDS  was awesome , John Hannah was clever backstabber along with the ruthless Lucy Lawless as His wife who ran their arena of death. The bravdo of Spartacus as He rose to the top an how We cheered as he said "" kill them all ' !Then the bad news of the cancer, the deley an then they made GODS OF THE ARENA , a prequel that was quite a good back story . then the news that Whitfield died, an picked a new SPARTACUS, but things didnt work out good since STARZ was losing money ..fast , and decided to cut the story down an yeah , kill off many characters toward the end of season 2 . Well to bring in new characters for the final season. Thete wasnt much they could do with them any way, the producers most likely said. Well season 3 should be a 'hell of a great story "" . The trailer shows a massive battle with hundreds of soldiers an Rebels. I would had loved to saw another season , but that isnt going to happen .

But the second season of the Spartacus saga (or unofficial THIRD season, depending how you look at it), called ""Vengeance,"" well, not so much.  This season, the bad outweighs the good.1) Liam Mcintyre, the actor picked as the ""replacement"" Spartacus, pales in comparison to the original Spartacus played by the wonderful Andy Whitfield.  Liam has none of the charisma, presence, personality, physical prowess or acting skills that Andy had.  And consequently, the character Spartacus is now a total bore to watch.2) Worse yet in the actor department, the wonderful actress Lesley-Ann Brandt (who played the character Naevia in ""Blood"" and ""Gods"") left the show and was replaced by the horrendously awful actress Cynthia Addai-Robinson.  Whenever Cynthia Addai-Robinson is on-screen the show is unwatchable.  Her acting is cringeworthy and she seems so out-of-place in comparison to every other actor on the show.  The producers of the show just could not have cast a worse actress to replace Lesley-Ann Brandt as Naevia.3) The action ""style"" of the show has gotten WORSE.  Instead of toning down the stupid ""300"" style action scenes, in this season the producers dramatically increased the irritating super slow-motion action and ridiculous looking gushing geysers of fake looking blood.  At this point the show might as well just become a cartoon or video game, because the action is just that goofy looking.  There's just ZERO imagination or creativity going into the fights and violence of this show now.4) The writing was very weak this season.  Seems like the writers really struggled this time out to come up with decent story lines, and the stories they did come up with mostly felt either rushed, underdeveloped, overcooked or nonsensical.  For example, the Seppius and Seppia characters seemed like great new additions to the show, but both were killed off, making their additions to the show seemingly pointless.  Likewise, the storyline involving hot new blonde Chadara went NOWHERE (again she was killed off before her story could develop).  And Lucy Lawless' character Lucretia really felt like she had little place in the season; her character turned into a mess and really served no purpose.  Also, Spartacus's tiny ""army"" of rebellious slaves started off strong, planning attacks and pulling off miraculous rescues of other slaves, but then mid-season they just sort of bog down at a temple and just sort of sit there waiting to get attacked for a very long period.  It became boring.5) The expected ""love story"" between Spartacus and Mira also seemed to be a non-starter.  It never developed into anything close to a love story, and then, spoiler alert, Mira dies, killing of any chance of a love story to bloom in the next (last) season.  Similarly, the relationship between Crixus and Naevia went nowhere.  The roller coaster relationship between Ilithyia and Glaber was the best ""relationship"" in the season, especially earlier on when Ilithyia was trying to leave Glaber.Overall, a huge disappointment.  But then the standards set were SO high.  ""Blood and Sand"" and ""Gods of the Arena"" are just so awesome.  It's hard for any show to maintain that level of greatness.",3,DISAPPOINTING,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",2012,3254,"['LOVED', 'hell', 'Blood', 'Sand', 'Gods', 'Arena', 'second', 'season', 'Spartacus', 'saga', 'unofficial', 'THIRD', 'season', 'depending', 'how', 'look', 'called', 'Vengeance', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'season', 'bad', 'good.1', 'Liam', 'Mcintyre', 'actor', 'picked', 'replacement', 'Spartacus', 'comparison', 'original', 'Spartacus', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Andy', 'Whitfield', 'Liam', 'none', 'charisma', 'presence', 'personality', 'physical', 'prowess', 'acting', 'skills', 'Andy', 'had', 'consequently', 'character', 'Spartacus', 'now', 'total', 'bore', 'watch.2', 'Worse', 'yet', 'actor', 'department', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Lesley-Ann', 'Brandt', 'who', 'played', 'character', 'Naevia', 'Blood', 'Gods', 'left', 'show', 'was', 'replaced', 'horrendously', 'awful', 'actress', 'Cynthia', 'Addai-Robinson', 'Whenever', 'Cynthia', 'Addai-Robinson', 'on-screen', 'show', 'unwatchable', 'acting', 'cringeworthy', 'so', 'out-of-place', 'comparison', 'other', 'actor', 'show', 'producers', 'show', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cast', 'worse', 'actress', 'replace', 'Lesley-Ann', 'Brandt', 'Naevia.3', 'action', 'style', 'show', 'gotten', 'WORSE', 'Instead', 'toning', 'down', 'stupid', '300', 'style', 'action', 'scenes', 'season', 'producers', 'dramatically', 'increased', 'irritating', 'super', 'slow-motion', 'action', 'ridiculous', 'looking', 'gushing', 'geysers', 'fake', 'looking', 'blood', 'point', 'show', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'become', 'cartoon', 'video', 'game', 'action', 'just', 'goofy', 'looking', 'just', 'ZERO', 'imagination', 'creativity', 'going', 'fights', 'violence', 'show', 'now.4', 'writing', 'was', 'very', 'weak', 'season', 'writers', 'really', 'struggled', 'time', 'come', 'up', 'decent', 'story', 'lines', 'stories', 'did', 'come', 'up', 'mostly', 'felt', 'rushed', 'underdeveloped', 'overcooked', 'nonsensical', 'example', 'Seppius', 'Seppia', 'characters', 'seemed', 'great', 'new', 'additions', 'show', 'were', 'killed', 'off', 'making', 'additions', 'show', 'seemingly', 'pointless', 'Likewise', 'storyline', 'involving', 'hot', 'new', 'blonde', 'Chadara', 'went', 'NOWHERE', 'again', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'story', 'could', 'develop', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'character', 'Lucretia', 'really', 'felt', 'had', 'little', 'place', 'season', 'character', 'turned', 'mess', 'really', 'served', 'purpose', 'Also', 'Spartacus', 'tiny', 'army', 'rebellious', 'slaves', 'started', 'off', 'strong', 'planning', 'attacks', 'pulling', 'off', 'miraculous', 'rescues', 'other', 'slaves', 'then', 'mid-season', 'just', 'sort', 'bog', 'down', 'temple', 'just', 'sort', 'sit', 'waiting', 'get', 'attacked', 'very', 'long', 'period', 'became', 'boring.5', 'expected', 'love', 'story', 'Spartacus', 'Mira', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'non-starter', 'never', 'developed', 'anything', 'close', 'love', 'story', 'then', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'Mira', 'killing', 'chance', 'love', 'story', 'bloom', 'next', 'last', 'season', 'Similarly', 'relationship', 'Crixus', 'Naevia', 'went', 'nowhere', 'roller', 'coaster', 'relationship', 'Ilithyia', 'Glaber', 'was', 'best', 'relationship', 'season', 'especially', 'earlier', 'when', 'Ilithyia', 'was', 'trying', 'leave', 'Glaber.Overall', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'then', 'standards', 'set', 'were', 'SO', 'high', 'Blood', 'Sand', 'Gods', 'Arena', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'awesome', 'hard', 'show', 'maintain', 'level', 'greatness']",N/A
