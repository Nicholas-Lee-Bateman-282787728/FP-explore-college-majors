I'd rate the first season five stars and the subsequent seasons two stars or less.I think the first season was a great show -- better than ER ever dreamed of being. I also think the show jumped the shark after the first season when they got rid of Peter McNichol (who ran off to head Ally McBeal's law firm), Mandy Patinkin quit the show and they wrote Kim Griest out of the script.I would buy a DVD collection of the first season of Chicago Hope in an instant, but I wouldn't want seasons 2-6 if I was given them for free.",3,One great season,1160179200,"10 7, 2006",2006,552,"['rating', 'mixed', 'bag', ""'d"", 'rate', 'first', 'season', 'five', 'stars', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'two', 'stars', 'less.I', 'think', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'better', 'ER', 'ever', 'dreamed', 'being', 'also', 'think', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', 'first', 'season', 'when', 'got', 'rid', 'Peter', 'McNichol', 'who', 'ran', 'off', 'head', 'Ally', 'McBeal', 'law', 'firm', 'Mandy', 'Patinkin', 'quit', 'show', 'wrote', 'Kim', 'Griest', 'script.I', 'would', 'buy', 'DVD', 'collection', 'first', 'season', 'Chicago', 'Hope', 'instant', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'seasons', '2-6', 'was', 'given', 'free']",Chicago Hope

ER is more accurate, less soapy (at least up until season 11) and is still one of TV's finest dramas. Chicago Hope was good, but not great. Disappointing for a David E. Kelley series.Nowhere near as good as his later hit, Boston Public.

I'd quickly snatch up season 1 of ""Chicago Hope"" and the first 2-3 seasons of ""Picket Fences"" if they came out.Regarding ""Chicago Hope"" vs ""ER""...to me, if anything, they're complements to each other.  ""Chicago Hope"" is quirky, methodical and character-driven.  ""ER"" is grounded, fast-paced, intense and plot-driven.  I've always preferred ""ER"", especially because I felt it was better and more satisfying for far longer(""Hope"" lost its appeal around season 3), but also because of the cast.  While ""Hope"" featured better actors, the group on ""ER"" just came off as more likable and easier to get attached to.  ""Hope"" also added and lost too many actors in its first couple seasons while ""ER"" lost just one core character in its first 4+ seasons.With that said, the first season and a half of ""Chicago Hope"" is a revelation, with its wildly eccentric group of characters, often crazy plots and its ability to really tug at your heartstrings without being too corny or over-the-top.  Not only is this a great cast in terms of individual performers, but they all work extremely well together.  For the kind of material David E. Kelley is famous/infamous for, you need a group that can smoothly interact with each other and make the insanity seem natural.  This wonderful ensemble gets the job done...nothing ever seems forced and you get the sense that these people feel genuinely comfortable in what is a surreal atmosphere.Special mention goes out to Mandy Patinkin and his character ""Jeffrey Geiger"", one of the best performances and characters in tv history.  Patinkin is always brilliant, managing to find the right note every time as a certifiable genius.  Even when the charcter can be a total a**, Patinkin's skill and charm keep you from disliking him.This is a great show that deserves to be on DVD.  Will David E. Kelley please stop rolling around in his gigantic pile of $100 bills and get this and ""Picket Fences"" on DVD already!",5,Does David E.
