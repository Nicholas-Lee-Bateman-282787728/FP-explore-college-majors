I highly recommend it to ANYONE, horsey or not.If you watch this you should know that in the match race at Belmont they have a grueling scene where Ruffian is running and then they zoom onto her legs and her front leg LITERALLY SNAPS in half. Younger children should not watch this scene. It is very sad. Also later on in the movie Ruffian shatters her other leg (though they don't show it) and it is heartbreaking.SPOILER:  *(Ruffian DOES end up needing to be put down at the end.)*WARNING: This is not like the Secretariat story.

1063516,A1YNOX3LETMDDP,B000OCY7KI,"Anthony Andrews ""Barbaro's Derby 132""","[0, 0]","I was fortunate enough to watch the broadcast premiere of this film. That very same day, a Thoroughbred contemporary named Rags To Riches won The Belmont. The third and final jewel of The Triple Crown. I remember hearing of Ruffian's story when I was a child, but was never well informed of her story from its humble beginning, to its tragic ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and purchased it when was first released on DVD. It is a film that I continue to enjoy every time I watch it, and Ruffian is a horse that I grow more fondly of as a result. My grandfather loved horse racing, and if he were alive today, I am confident that he would have enjoyed the film the same way I have. Though Ruffian has long since passed, her beauty, as spoken of in the film, will never fade. She did make a lasting impression on not only the sport, but upon all of the hearts and minds of the people who love and adore these creatures just as I do. Her career was as Mr. Nack stated, ""An Unfinished Symphony"" I know that he spoke of ""The Great Match Race"" as the unfinished symphony of horse racing. However, I feel that Ruffian's breakdown and subsequent passing transcended the sport. It was the loss of one of the sports greatest thoroughbreds, and the loss of a life incomplete in its form, substance and overall composition. Hence, her life, was The Unfinished Symphony.....",5,The Unfinished Symphony......,1205280000,"03 12, 2008",2008,1370,"['was', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'watch', 'broadcast', 'premiere', 'film', 'very', 'same', 'day', 'Thoroughbred', 'contemporary', 'named', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'won', 'Belmont', 'third', 'final', 'jewel', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'remember', 'hearing', 'Ruffian', 'story', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'was', 'never', 'well', 'informed', 'story', 'humble', 'beginning', 'tragic', 'ending', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'purchased', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'DVD', 'film', 'continue', 'enjoy', 'time', 'watch', 'Ruffian', 'horse', 'grow', 'more', 'fondly', 'result', 'grandfather', 'loved', 'horse', 'racing', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'am', 'confident', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'same', 'way', 'have', 'Though', 'Ruffian', 'long', 'passed', 'beauty', 'spoken', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'fade', 'did', 'make', 'lasting', 'impression', 'not', 'only', 'sport', 'hearts', 'minds', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'adore', 'creatures', 'just', 'do', 'career', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Nack', 'stated', 'Unfinished', 'Symphony', 'know', 'spoke', 'Great', 'Match', 'Race', 'unfinished', 'symphony', 'horse', 'racing', 'However', 'feel', 'Ruffian', 'breakdown', 'subsequent', 'passing', 'transcended', 'sport', 'was', 'loss', 'one', 'sports', 'greatest', 'thoroughbreds', 'loss', 'life', 'incomplete', 'form', 'substance', 'overall', 'composition', 'Hence', 'life', 'was', 'Unfinished', 'Symphony', '..']",Ruffian

1063519,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B000OCY7KI,Best Of All,"[4, 4]","As these ESPN Original Entertainment productions have gone over the years, this is arguably the finest, though with several controversies, which the movies seemingly cannot run away from.Originally airing June 9, 2007, on ABC, Sam Shepard does a commendable job portraying Ruffian's trainer, Frank Whiteley. With much of the focus on Ruffian's performances, the staged racing shots are good, especially with then Belmont Park race announcer Dave Johnson - portraying himself - recreating his work. But with the availability of most of the actual racing footage - used as part of a wealth of bonus features - would have been a major plus.The story-telling element is strange, as it evolves into the relationship between Whiteley and reporter William Nack (played by Frank Whaley). Nack penned an ESPN Books-published recollection on Ruffian, which was not a movie tie-in, entitled, Ruffian: A Race Track Romance. At times the script bogs down in scenes where Nack - who works on special projects for ESPN - seemingly towers over the trainer and racer.There is rightfully heavy emphasis on the July 6, 1975, ""Battle of the Sexes"" match-race between Ruffian and Kentucky Derby champion, Foolish Pleasure. With more than 50,000 fans jammed into Belmont Park and an estimated 18 million TV viewers, Ruffian suffered a hideous breakdown of her right foreleg and was euthanized one day later when she broke the cast and another leg after surgery, which lasted 12 hours.The bonus features puts the real story in its true historic perspective. It includes an interview (surprise!) with Nack and an important conversation with Jane Schwartz, who wrote the definitive biography on Ruffian, the 1991 release, Ruffian: Burning From the Start.The movie alone does not tell the complete the story. The DVD bonus features and books by Schwartz & Nack will give a more complete picture on a phenomenal filly who ultimately was a victim of human ego and media greed.",3,Not A Complete Picture On This Tragic Career,1196640000,"12 3, 2007",2007,1948,"['ESPN', 'Original', 'Entertainment', 'productions', 'have', 'gone', 'years', 'arguably', 'finest', 'several', 'controversies', 'movies', 'seemingly', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'away', 'from.Originally', 'airing', 'June', '9', '2007', 'ABC', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'commendable', 'job', 'portraying', 'Ruffian', 'trainer', 'Frank', 'Whiteley', 'much', 'focus', 'Ruffian', 'performances', 'staged', 'racing', 'shots', 'are', 'good', 'especially', 'then', 'Belmont', 'Park', 'race', 'announcer', 'Dave', 'Johnson', 'portraying', 'recreating', 'work', 'availability', 'most', 'actual', 'racing', 'footage', 'used', 'part', 'wealth', 'bonus', 'features', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'plus.The', 'story-telling', 'element', 'strange', 'relationship', 'Whiteley', 'reporter', 'William', 'Nack', 'played', 'Frank', 'Whaley', 'Nack', 'penned', 'ESPN', 'Books-published', 'recollection', 'Ruffian', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'tie-in', 'entitled', 'Ruffian', 'Race', 'Track', 'Romance', 'times', 'script', 'bogs', 'down', 'scenes', 'where', 'Nack', 'who', 'special', 'projects', 'ESPN', 'seemingly', 'towers', 'trainer', 'racer.There', 'rightfully', 'heavy', 'emphasis', 'July', '6', '1975', 'Battle', 'Sexes', 'match-race', 'Ruffian', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'champion', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'more', '50,000', 'fans', 'jammed', 'Belmont', 'Park', 'estimated', '18', 'million', 'TV', 'viewers', 'Ruffian', 'suffered', 'hideous', 'breakdown', 'right', 'foreleg', 'was', 'euthanized', 'one', 'day', 'later', 'when', 'broke', 'cast', 'leg', 'surgery', 'lasted', '12', 'hours.The', 'bonus', 'real', 'story', 'true', 'historic', 'perspective', 'interview', 'surprise', 'Nack', 'important', 'conversation', 'Jane', 'Schwartz', 'who', 'wrote', 'definitive', 'biography', 'Ruffian', '1991', 'release', 'Ruffian', 'Burning', 'Start.The', 'movie', 'alone', 'not', 'tell', 'complete', 'story', 'DVD', 'bonus', 'features', 'books', 'Schwartz', 'Nack', 'will', 'give', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'phenomenal', 'filly', 'who', 'ultimately', 'was', 'victim', 'human', 'ego', 'media', 'greed']",Ruffian

If I also suggested any film could ever be adequate as tribute to what Ruffian deserves, I'd be fibbing, so keep in mind I'm not the most impartial reviewer here.Despite the inevitably tragic ending we all knew would come, I looked forward to this Ruffian bio-pic for many months, was glad the story of this great athlete was going to be told in tribute to her, and even urged people I know to watch it. Ultimately after seeing the film Ruffian back in June I felt let down and regretted sticking my neck out to be its cheerleader. Perhaps on the big screen, with a larger budget, flaws in this film would have been corrected, the races would have seemed more glorious and been given central billing in the plot, and the visuals would have done justice to the real footage we have of Ruffian leaving competitors behind in her dust.As it was, while I have to admit filmmakers did their best and no doubt struggled within limitations of time and finances, I felt I was seeing a human interest story in which Ruffian was a background player. How long was the cumulative onscreen run-time of all her races? Two or three minutes out of two hours? Plus there were just too many inaccuracies to look away and let them go unnoticed. I won't point them out here because I don't want to dampen anyone else's viewing experience and know there are others who do like this film about thoroughbred racing's fastest filly (maybe fastest horse ever) but bear in mind both Ruffian's real life trainer Frank Whiteley, and her jockey Jacinto Vasquez, sued to stop this production. Both are on record as criticizing their portrayals and the facts as offered in the ABC movie, and that should tell you something right there.I also must get it off my chest that the various geldings (and it was annoyingly obvious in a few scenes that these were male horses playing a female) who portrayed Ruffian failed to embody her. Yes, their coloration was right, as were the stars on their foreheads, but not one of the equine actors was anything like Ruffian's seventeen hands, and none came remotely close to displaying her build, which has frequently been cited for thirty years as proportionately perfect, the ideal for thoroughbreds, the standard for which breeders should aim. Ruffian had inner fire and spirited energy, and those horses were calm and dull. Was what we saw onscreen honestly the best casting could have done?As I said earlier, I know the cast, crew, and everyone else who had a hand in putting this version of Ruffian's story on the screen did their best, but sometimes a person's best isn't good enough, particularly when this many lazy flaws were allowed to slip in uncorrected. This should have been entitled ""The Story of the People Around Ruffian"" because that's sure how it felt.

The timing couldn't have been more perfect as a set-up to the film about another fily, the great Ruffian, starring Sam Shepherd as Ruffian's trainer. For anyone who loves horses or horse racing, this is a must-see, telling the story of a horse with such heart, such a drive to race - and of the people who worked with her, including her extraordinary trainer.Ruffian was undefeated in 10 races against other fillies and the movie leads up to a match against Foolish Pleasure. In other words, male against female. I won't say more because you deserve to see this film and experience the thrill of entering the world of racing, trainers, jockeys, etc. In any case, I was riveted.

1063532,ATXL536YX71TR,B000OCY7KI,"KerrLines ""&#34;Movies,Music,Theatre&#34;""","[2, 2]","Sorry, but what was supposed to be a major theatrical release on July 26( the theatres in our area had this ""coming to theatres"" trailers) was somehow reduced to a made-for-television, release-to-dvd cheap low budget melodrama.After very lackluster reviews of the book and film came out in the NY Times I suppose that the producers felt that it would be too risky a proposition to put RUFFIAN in the theaters. I think they were right!Horses and horse racing as well as films have been a lifelong passion for me.I saw the ill-fated Match Race on t.v. as a college student in 1975. I also had the distinct pleasure of seeing Ruffian run and win The Sorority, The Spinaway and the CCA Oaks. She WAS as magnificent as anything the world has ever seen. Being a Marylander, we claimed Ruffian as our own, though technically she was a Kentucky bred as her sire, Reviewer, was standing stud in Kentucky. Her dam, Shenanigans was as Maryland as Maryland could be, as she was a daughter of the great Native Dancer,who stood stud in Baltimore County. Her owners, the Janneys, also lived in the ""valley"" (as we say here!). Her trainer, Frank Whiteley was also a Marylander and had trained the famous Horse of the Year, Damascus, in 1966-1968. After Ruffian's tragic death, a video was produced showing her ten victories from start to finish,as well as her ""breaking down"" against Foolish Pleasure.( It used to be available through a video sales outlet specializing in horse products). It was documentarian in style with narration; pretty straightforward.Now ...back to this film. On the positive side, RUFFIAN does do a good job at chronicling her racing career. The SLO-MO showing of her breaking her joint is quite graphic and will probably be very disturbing to young viewers...so WARNING! The film also does an excellent job at showing the decline in interest (which has gotten worse) in horse racing in America and how the NYRA (New York Racing Association) wanted to capitalize upon Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure in order to ""revive"" interest in the sport.(NOTE: match racing had become obsolete by the 1970's and fortunately these kind of events were rarely if at all  in America after Ruffian's breakdown, which was noted in the end credits. Another interesting point that is brought out in the match race call (by retired and legendary track announcer Dave Johnson)is that Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure ran the first quarter mile in .22 and 1/5 seconds.For those interested, that is way too fast for horses to be running safely at a mile-and-a-quarter distance.That was very true.(This is what happens in match races: horses go ""all out"" and it really is dangerous)Also, the film does correctly point out that Ruffian DID break her other leg coming out of the anesthesia (always the biggest concern apart from infection).Another point of interest NOT noted in the film is that Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure were actually related in that they both had the same paternal grandsire, Bold Ruler, who had been known as a sire that brought speed and unsoundness to the breed. Also, Ruffian's damsire, Native Dancer, also infused the breed with knee problems.(Just a few notes of interest!)NOW...for the NOT so positive: this film really falters due to the  ""saccharin"" of the script and the really inane dialogue that relies on stereotypical characters and cliche. The film seems to be intent on being G-rated (remember: this film was to originally be a theatrical release when it was started)  and geared to a family audience. The sentimentality is SO forced that as a horse race lover AND a film devotee I was truly torn. I thought the world of Ruffian, but this film has a very low budget look to it, and the acting from the news reporters and extras is right out ABC Family or Lifetime. It is REALLY bad!!!Frank Whiteley and the Janney's are not the slightest bit like what they were portrayed (this is not even a Hollywoodized production...it is cheaper that that!)  Even the soundtrack is appropriately syrupy.Sorry, but I am glad I taped this off of television where I had to pay nothing!My conclusion is that for info,RUFFIAN is  accurate, but the execution as a film is woefully inadequate for a champion of her stature. It was somewhat interesting that the filly Rags to Riches won the Belmont Stakes over the colt Curlin two hours before RUFFIAN was aired as if Ruffian and her sex had somehow been vindicated!",3,She was the greatest....but this film isn't!,1181433600,"06 10, 2007",2007,4409,"['Sorry', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'major', 'theatrical', 'release', 'July', '26', 'theatres', 'area', 'had', 'coming', 'theatres', 'trailers', 'was', 'somehow', 'reduced', 'made-for-television', 'release-to-dvd', 'cheap', 'low', 'budget', 'melodrama.After', 'very', 'lackluster', 'reviews', 'book', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'NY', 'Times', 'suppose', 'producers', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'risky', 'proposition', 'put', 'RUFFIAN', 'theaters', 'think', 'were', 'right', 'Horses', 'horse', 'racing', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'lifelong', 'passion', 'me.I', 'saw', 'ill-fated', 'Match', 'Race', 't.v', 'college', 'student', '1975', 'also', 'had', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'Ruffian', 'run', 'win', 'Sorority', 'Spinaway', 'CCA', 'Oaks', 'WAS', 'as', 'magnificent', 'anything', 'world', 'ever', 'seen', 'Being', 'Marylander', 'claimed', 'Ruffian', 'own', 'technically', 'was', 'Kentucky', 'bred', 'sire', 'Reviewer', 'was', 'standing', 'stud', 'Kentucky', 'dam', 'Shenanigans', 'was', 'as', 'Maryland', 'Maryland', 'could', 'be', 'was', 'daughter', 'great', 'Native', 'Dancer', 'who', 'stood', 'stud', 'Baltimore', 'County', 'owners', 'Janneys', 'also', 'lived', 'valley', 'say', 'here', 'trainer', 'Frank', 'Whiteley', 'was', 'also', 'Marylander', 'had', 'trained', 'famous', 'Horse', 'Year', 'Damascus', '1966-1968', 'Ruffian', 'tragic', 'death', 'video', 'was', 'produced', 'showing', 'ten', 'victories', 'start', 'finish', 'as', 'well', 'breaking', 'down', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'used', 'be', 'available', 'video', 'sales', 'outlet', 'specializing', 'horse', 'products', 'was', 'documentarian', 'style', 'narration', 'pretty', 'straightforward.Now', 'back', 'film', 'positive', 'side', 'RUFFIAN', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'chronicling', 'racing', 'career', 'SLO-MO', 'showing', 'breaking', 'joint', 'quite', 'graphic', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'very', 'disturbing', 'young', 'viewers', 'so', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'showing', 'decline', 'interest', 'gotten', 'worse', 'horse', 'racing', 'America', 'how', 'NYRA', 'New', 'York', 'Racing', 'Association', 'wanted', 'capitalize', 'Ruffian', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'order', 'revive', 'interest', 'sport', 'NOTE', 'match', 'racing', 'had', 'become', 'obsolete', '1970', 'fortunately', 'kind', 'events', 'were', 'rarely', 'America', 'Ruffian', 'breakdown', 'was', 'noted', 'end', 'credits', 'interesting', 'point', 'brought', 'out', 'match', 'race', 'call', 'retired', 'legendary', 'track', 'announcer', 'Dave', 'Johnson', 'Ruffian', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'ran', 'first', 'quarter', 'mile', '.22', '1/5', 'seconds.For', 'interested', 'way', 'too', 'fast', 'horses', 'be', 'running', 'safely', 'mile-and-a-quarter', 'distance.That', 'was', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'match', 'races', 'horses', 'go', 'out', 'really', 'dangerous', 'Also', 'film', 'correctly', 'point', 'out', 'Ruffian', 'DID', 'break', 'other', 'leg', 'coming', 'anesthesia', 'always', 'biggest', 'concern', 'apart', 'infection', 'point', 'interest', 'NOT', 'noted', 'film', 'Ruffian', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'were', 'actually', 'related', 'had', 'same', 'paternal', 'grandsire', 'Bold', 'Ruler', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'known', 'sire', 'brought', 'speed', 'unsoundness', 'breed', 'Also', 'Ruffian', 'damsire', 'Native', 'Dancer', 'also', 'infused', 'breed', 'knee', 'problems', 'Just', 'few', 'notes', 'interest', 'NOW', 'NOT', 'so', 'positive', 'film', 'really', 'falters', 'due', 'saccharin', 'script', 'really', 'inane', 'dialogue', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'cliche', 'film', 'be', 'intent', 'being', 'G-rated', 'remember', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'be', 'theatrical', 'release', 'when', 'was', 'started', 'geared', 'family', 'audience', 'sentimentality', 'SO', 'forced', 'horse', 'race', 'lover', 'film', 'devotee', 'was', 'truly', 'torn', 'thought', 'world', 'Ruffian', 'film', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'look', 'acting', 'news', 'reporters', 'extras', 'right', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Lifetime', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'Frank', 'Whiteley', 'Janney', 'are', 'not', 'slightest', 'bit', 'what', 'were', 'portrayed', 'not', 'even', 'Hollywoodized', 'production', 'cheaper', 'Even', 'soundtrack', 'appropriately', 'syrupy.Sorry', 'am', 'glad', 'taped', 'off', 'television', 'where', 'had', 'pay', 'nothing', 'conclusion', 'info', 'RUFFIAN', 'accurate', 'execution', 'film', 'woefully', 'inadequate', 'champion', 'stature', 'was', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'filly', 'Rags', 'Riches', 'won', 'Belmont', 'Stakes', 'colt', 'Curlin', 'two', 'hours', 'RUFFIAN', 'was', 'aired', 'Ruffian', 'sex', 'had', 'somehow', 'been', 'vindicated']",Ruffian

It's too bad that a match race was set for Ruffian to run against Foolish Pleasure, a colt who won the Kentucky Derby and got second in the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont, to see who would win on the grueling Belmont track to attract the people to the tracks again and to see who would win, the race of the sexes. After coming out of the starting gate she hit the side of it, injuring herself but still kept on running. When she was drawing away from Foolish Pleasure, winning the race to the wire to broke down, while Foolish Pleasure kept on running and ""won,"" the race...I won't tell you more, but this is a wonderful movie showing us the spirit of these wonderful thoroughbreds at their best! If you love horse racing, and enjoyed watching Dreamer, Seabiscuit or Phar Lap, this is a movie to see. I've read the book Ruffian: Burning from the Start by Jane Schwartz before I saw the movie, and it is very similar and keeps to the story except for the interactions/conversations between Frank Whiteley and the journalist Bill Nack. Bill Nack wrote a book on Ruffian, stitching himself into the story so ESPN could have the rights to make the film, despite the trainer/jockey themselves refusing to give them permission to make a movie on the famous filly... well, that's Hollywood for you.Despite all that this was a wonderful film. And I highly recommend it!",5,Burning from the Start!,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1728,"['was', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'be', 'shelved', 'greatest', 'horse', 'race', 'movies', 'Seabiscuit', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'story', 'Ruffian', 'filly', 'who', 'won', 'race', 'was', 'always', 'out', 'front', 'broke', 'track', 'record', 'blistering', 'speed', 'beautiful', 'style', 'Even', 'trainer', 'great', 'Secretariat', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'better', 'too', 'bad', 'match', 'race', 'was', 'set', 'Ruffian', 'run', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'colt', 'who', 'won', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'got', 'second', 'Preakness', 'Stakes', 'Belmont', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'grueling', 'Belmont', 'track', 'attract', 'people', 'tracks', 'again', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'win', 'race', 'sexes', 'coming', 'out', 'starting', 'gate', 'hit', 'side', 'injuring', 'still', 'kept', 'running', 'When', 'was', 'drawing', 'away', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'winning', 'race', 'wire', 'broke', 'down', 'Foolish', 'Pleasure', 'kept', 'running', 'won', 'race', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'more', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'showing', 'spirit', 'wonderful', 'thoroughbreds', 'best', 'love', 'horse', 'racing', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Dreamer', 'Seabiscuit', 'Phar', 'Lap', 'movie', 'see', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'Ruffian', 'Burning', 'Start', 'Jane', 'Schwartz', 'saw', 'movie', 'very', 'similar', 'story', 'interactions/conversations', 'Frank', 'Whiteley', 'journalist', 'Bill', 'Nack', 'Bill', 'Nack', 'wrote', 'book', 'Ruffian', 'stitching', 'story', 'so', 'ESPN', 'could', 'have', 'rights', 'make', 'film', 'trainer/jockey', 'refusing', 'give', 'permission', 'make', 'movie', 'famous', 'filly', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'you.Despite', 'was', 'wonderful', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend']",Ruffian
