1090396,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000TJ6OZ2,&#308;&#308;,"[7, 7]","Dance Off the Inches: Hip Hop Party is a little slow compared to other hip hop workouts, but it still is extremely cardio and a lot of fun to do.  Jennifer Galardi leads, and she has a really fun personality and teaching style.  The workout is divided into three totally different hip hop styles that are each fun to do in their own way.  The sections on the DVD are:Warm Up - Jennifer starts out with a funky style march before going to some chest and hip isolations in this warm up.  Then she'll finish up with one or two more easy dance moves.  It's all very basic, but it's still effective.Basic Hip Hop - This routine is a lot of fun, consisting of some funky dance moves that are pretty easy to pull off and really fun to do.  It consists of easy moves such as slides, marches, stomps, and butterflies, but Jennifer adds upper body style to make it more cardio and more funky.  It was definitely, my favorite of all the routines.Sexy Smooth - Now this routine seemed to be a mixture of Jazz, Striptease, and Arabian dancing.  It didn't move too much over the floor, but it still managed to get your heart rate up.  There are a lot of moves in this dance that involve the hips, but there were also a few body roll moves, kick ball change moves, and more.  It definitely had a sensual feel to it which is a bit different from normal hip hop workouts.World - Last was this routine that fused hip hop with Latin and Bollywood dance moves.  It was a lot of fun as it contained lunges, box steps, chest pumps, and more with some very fun arms that made it all the more fun to do.  This was definitely the highest impact of the three workouts, and it was a really nice fusion of dance.  NOTE: This is the same routine as the Cardio Dance download that is available here on Amazon, on exerciseTV, and on Jennifer Galardi's website.Cool Down - The cool down was also amazing.  It had so many feel good stretches that stretched out the entire body.  It was a great way to finish the workout.Step Guide - Also included on the DVD is a step guide that breaks down some of the moves slowly in order to allow you to learn them slowly and use them in the workout.  This makes it a great DVD for beginner exercisers/dancers while the intermediate/advanced dancers/exercisers may just want to jump right into the workout.  NOTE: The step guide is not included in the downloaded version of this DVD available here on Amazon Video on Demand.Overall, this was an amazing workout although it went slower than normal hip hop workouts.  The three sections were all fun yet different enough to keep the interest of the viewer.  I would highly recommend it to all levels of exercisers and hip hop dancers.  It truly is a blast to do!",4,"This is slightly slower than normal hip hop dance, but it is still a great workout!",1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,2714,"['Dance', 'Off', 'Inches', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'Party', 'little', 'slow', 'compared', 'other', 'hip', 'hop', 'workouts', 'still', 'extremely', 'cardio', 'lot', 'fun', 'do', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'really', 'fun', 'personality', 'teaching', 'style', 'workout', 'divided', 'three', 'totally', 'different', 'hip', 'hop', 'styles', 'are', 'fun', 'do', 'own', 'way', 'sections', 'DVD', 'are', 'Warm', 'Up', 'Jennifer', 'out', 'funky', 'style', 'march', 'going', 'chest', 'hip', 'isolations', 'warm', 'up', 'Then', ""'ll"", 'finish', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'more', 'easy', 'dance', 'moves', 'very', 'basic', 'still', 'effective.Basic', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'routine', 'lot', 'fun', 'consisting', 'funky', 'dance', 'moves', 'are', 'pretty', 'easy', 'pull', 'off', 'really', 'fun', 'do', 'easy', 'moves', 'such', 'slides', 'marches', 'stomps', 'butterflies', 'Jennifer', 'upper', 'body', 'style', 'make', 'more', 'cardio', 'more', 'funky', 'was', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'routines.Sexy', 'Smooth', 'Now', 'routine', 'seemed', 'be', 'mixture', 'Jazz', 'Striptease', 'Arabian', 'dancing', 'did', ""n't"", 'move', 'too', 'much', 'floor', 'still', 'managed', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'are', 'lot', 'moves', 'dance', 'involve', 'hips', 'were', 'also', 'few', 'body', 'roll', 'moves', 'kick', 'ball', 'change', 'moves', 'more', 'definitely', 'had', 'sensual', 'feel', 'bit', 'different', 'normal', 'hip', 'hop', 'workouts.World', 'Last', 'was', 'routine', 'fused', 'hip', 'hop', 'Latin', 'Bollywood', 'dance', 'moves', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'contained', 'lunges', 'box', 'steps', 'chest', 'pumps', 'more', 'very', 'fun', 'arms', 'made', 'more', 'fun', 'do', 'was', 'definitely', 'highest', 'impact', 'three', 'workouts', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'fusion', 'dance', 'NOTE', 'same', 'routine', 'Cardio', 'Dance', 'download', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'exerciseTV', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'website.Cool', 'Down', 'cool', 'down', 'was', 'also', 'amazing', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'feel', 'good', 'stretches', 'stretched', 'out', 'entire', 'body', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'finish', 'workout.Step', 'Guide', 'Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'step', 'guide', 'down', 'moves', 'slowly', 'order', 'allow', 'learn', 'slowly', 'use', 'workout', 'great', 'DVD', 'beginner', 'exercisers/dancers', 'intermediate/advanced', 'dancers/exercisers', 'may', 'just', 'want', 'jump', 'right', 'workout', 'NOTE', 'step', 'guide', 'not', 'included', 'downloaded', 'version', 'DVD', 'available', 'here', 'Amazon', 'Video', 'Demand.Overall', 'was', 'amazing', 'workout', 'went', 'slower', 'normal', 'hip', 'hop', 'workouts', 'three', 'sections', 'were', 'fun', 'yet', 'different', 'enough', 'keep', 'interest', 'viewer', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'levels', 'exercisers', 'hip', 'hop', 'dancers', 'truly', 'blast', 'do']",Dance Off The Inches: Hip Hop Party

I usually end up sitting on the couch as I watch incredibly thin people in downward facing dog pose, or bounce around enthusiastically while telling you to breathe.  This DVD has actually captured my attention and kept it.  I'm overseas, so when my package was brought to me at work, I popped it in the computer to get an idea.  Jennifer is pleasantly upbeat without being annoying.  You can tell she has dance training, her moves are precise and well-chosen.  The step guide is wonderful, I can go through and get each move down pat before I start the workout.  If you're looking for genuine hip/hop dance moves, you won't really find it here, but remember that this is an aerobic workout, not a dance routine. There is a little bit of African, Samba and jazz-like dance in one of the segements, and all of them are fun and upbeat.  The music is good, too.  For people who are already in shape, this might not prove strenuous, but it got me sweating.Overall, it's just a fun workout.

I purchased this based on the reviews from those at my level so had realistic expectations and hope I can guide someone like me. If you are an advanced exerciser who has familiarity with dance videos and can pick up dance steps quickly (most hip-hop videos have similar moves), you'll be doing this video easily on the first run and having fun. I think the moves are very simple. The down side is that they are also limited and repetitive so you'll get bored quickly with it, probably by the second or third viewing. Done alone, I don't feel ""worked out"" enough. However, it's  great to have it in your repertoire for variety, or to use as a fun warm-up with a little cardio before doing another toning video such as her Ballet Body which I really enjoy. The 2 done back to back (if you have time) complement each other well and provide a full workout for the advanced exerciser. I think Jennifer Galardi is a very good instructor.

You can watch clips of this at Collage or I'm sure somewhere on Youtube.I really enjoyed the Dance Off the Inches Belly Dance (Bollywood) workout as well.All of the Dance off the Inches series are fairly low impact, however, I have lost 5 lbs and about an inch in my waist within the last month just doing these workouts and some weight training at the gym. I am an advanced exerciser and have been working out for 20 years and normally do Cathe, Amy Bento, Kelly Coffey Meyer step, boot camp, kickboxing style workouts and didn't think these would do much since they are such low impact.  I wanted to learn all of the routines so I could add all the workouts into my mix.  Well, I enjoy all of them so much, they are all the cardio I have been doing.

1090414,A1F3VRLGW5NAJB,B000TJ6OZ2,Gail,"[331, 333]","I own a number of dance workouts and this is my favorite so far.  There is a  step guide in a separate chapter, which can be used to learn the steps in half time.  This is great because Jennifer does not have to slow down the tempo of the workouts to teach the steps in half time.  The step guide is a fabulous idea and makes this DVD superior to most dance workout routines on the market.  Because of my familiarity with dance DVD's, I only had to do the step guide once, but it was very helpful.During the workouts, Jennifer still introduces each step with the feet first, followed by adding the arms. And she does the typical build of multiple steps for each routine.  To learn the routines, I focus on learning the steps first and then I add the arms in later attempts.Jennifer is an excellent instructor.  She does a great job of providing good advance cues for step changes.  She also cues ""left or right"" that is the opposite of her left or right (mirror form), so it is easy to follow her lead.Potential customers may be put off by the fact that this is a hip hop dance routine.  Never fear.  I really liked mixing things up from the usual Latin and Jazz routines.  But, be ready for a lot of hip action.I am at an age (54) and weight where my knees do not tolerate a lot of abuse.  I was still able to do almost all of the routines or I could easily modify what Jennifer was doing to be a little more knee friendly.

However, I have been dancing for over 20+ years, all different styles, from ballroom to hip hop and I have found it difficult to get all the steps down my first time trying this workout. That doesn't mean it's not doable, but it WILL take you a few workouts to get the choreography, arm movements and flicks. In the meantime, you should listen to Jennifer and do what you feel rather than worrying about how you look.Having said that though this is still a great heart-pumping cardio and even if you don't get every move down, you will get a good workout since you are constantly moving. The step guide tutorial is helpful but doesn't allow too much practice (you practice a step 3-4 times before moving on) so repeated viewings help, but nothing is better than doing the steps in the workout itself.I love Jennifer Galardi's workouts, her choreography and personality. And am I the only one who thinks she looks just like Jennifer Aniston?? lol Her cuing and form are great as always and she has just the right amount of pep. And I love her process of starting off a move and then building on it so you can perfect the base move and then add arms and styling.This is a great DVD if you are looking for a little more of a challenge in your dance workouts (those of you who use the 10 Minute Solution DVDs know what I mean), the time goes by rather quickly and she does incorporate some great, fun and sexy dance moves.

It is fast paced enough to be a good aerobic workout, but you could also take those sexy moves right out onto the dance floor, or onto the stage for a belly dance performance! The  moves are varied and the transitions are smooth, but you will have to work hard to keep up with it.Don't be misled by the ""10 easy steps"" mentioned in the DVD description, however. This is not a beginner's workout. Although there is a step guide, the steps would definitely not be easy for a non-dancer. Even if you leave out the arm motions when you first start out (a good strategy to use with a new DVD), there are a lot of complex movements that involve a lot of hip action and torso motion, along with the steps.You'll need good balance, lots of flexibility and quick reflexes to do this workout. If you have some dance/ aerobics experience, stick with it until you get it! As you start to master the steps, you will get hooked on this irresistible workout.

Jennifer is relaxed here, she was never annoying in my opinion, she only mostly gives you cues to help move your body right which is what you need most, no fake encouraging or weird personal tidbits others might give. With the step guide, I had no problem following & though I didn't get it perfect, I never felt frustrated because I knew I'd get it within a couple tries for two reasons: The step guide was a great help & helps to keep the pace going so you don't get bored or lower your heart rate & because the actual speed of the moves is a little slower then it should be. The moves are done more like 3/4 speed & I felt like I was a little stuck on learning speed. It wasn't that annoying, but I swear I could tell even Jennifer wanted to go a faster rate.

I don't do it every day--I prefer to exercise outside, but for rainy/windy/too cold days, this is great. Usually when I start this workout, I am feeling sluggish, like I'd really rather sit on the sofa for an hour or something and I have the idea the workout is going to be a struggle, but after about 3-4 minutes, I get totally pumped and really start enjoying myself. The time flies by like nothing and before I know it the video is over.Pluses:I really like Jennifer Galardi's manner. She's peppy but not annoying and she's serious but not intimidating.It's a good workout. I always feel sweaty and invigorated after.It's an excellent rainy-day workout.I have actually used moves from this workout on the social dance floor. I use the ""salsa walks"" all the time and the hip-cracks, too.I have owned it for more than six months and have used it about 3 times a month in that time, and the program has not yet become either boring or irritating.On the downside:I don't think this is a workout for beginners. I've been dancing all my life and it seems easy to me, but I think the way she phrases some of the directions would not make sense to someone with no dance experience. For example: ""Put a body roll into it; make it a return.""The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5--I don't know why fitness videographers ALWAYS feel compelled to cut away from the main person or just show their legs or something. It's probably artful, but I get confused when the camera shifts away from Jennifer to focus on her feet or on one of the other dancers.The music is not what I would pick, but it's not horrible, either.",4,So much fun,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,1669,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'about', '6-8', 'months', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'day', 'prefer', 'exercise', 'outside', 'rainy/windy/too', 'cold', 'days', 'great', 'Usually', 'when', 'start', 'workout', 'am', 'feeling', 'sluggish', ""'d"", 'really', 'rather', 'sit', 'sofa', 'hour', 'something', 'have', 'idea', 'workout', 'going', 'be', 'struggle', '3-4', 'minutes', 'get', 'totally', 'pumped', 'really', 'start', 'enjoying', 'time', 'flies', 'nothing', 'know', 'video', 'over.Pluses', 'really', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'manner', 'peppy', 'not', 'annoying', 'serious', 'not', 'intimidating.It', 'good', 'workout', 'always', 'feel', 'sweaty', 'invigorated', 'after.It', 'excellent', 'rainy-day', 'workout.I', 'have', 'actually', 'used', 'moves', 'workout', 'social', 'dance', 'floor', 'use', 'salsa', 'walks', 'time', 'hip-cracks', 'too.I', 'have', 'owned', 'more', 'six', 'months', 'have', 'used', '3', 'times', 'month', 'time', 'program', 'not', 'yet', 'become', 'boring', 'irritating.On', 'downside', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'workout', 'beginners', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dancing', 'life', 'easy', 'think', 'way', 'directions', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'someone', 'dance', 'experience', 'example', 'Put', 'body', 'roll', 'make', 'return', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'fitness', 'videographers', 'ALWAYS', 'feel', 'compelled', 'cut', 'away', 'main', 'person', 'just', 'show', 'legs', 'something', 'probably', 'artful', 'get', 'confused', 'when', 'camera', 'away', 'Jennifer', 'focus', 'feet', 'one', 'other', 'dancers.The', 'music', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'pick', 'not', 'horrible', 'either']",Dance Off The Inches: Hip Hop Party
