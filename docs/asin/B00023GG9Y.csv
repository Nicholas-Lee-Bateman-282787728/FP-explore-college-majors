Not only do we have Beau and Lloyd Bridges, but also Rex Harrison, Olivia De Havilland, Jose Ferrer, Cornel Wilde and Ursula Andress but there are also actors who have achieved even greater fame since this movie was released in the 1970s such as Ian McShane and Sylvia Kristal.The Dumas story had been adapted for the screen before and since (in the weak Leonardo DiCaprio movie), but never has it been so much fun and so entertaining to watch.The crew were obviously all having a great time making this movie and it really shows, there is humor, action and suspense right to the last moment and the DVD transfer is a good one that will not leave you dissapointed.One reservation I do have is the lack of extra's for the price tag. We are only given a smattering of trailers for movies such as &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;...Still, this is a great movie and well worth adding to your collection.",5,Fun movie with an amazing cast,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,1045,"['Just', 'look', 'cast', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'adaptation', 'quot', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'quot', 'story', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'have', 'Beau', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'also', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Olivia', 'De', 'Havilland', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'are', 'also', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'achieved', 'even', 'greater', 'fame', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '1970s', 'such', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Sylvia', 'Kristal.The', 'Dumas', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'adapted', 'screen', 'weak', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'movie', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'so', 'entertaining', 'watch.The', 'crew', 'were', 'obviously', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'really', 'humor', 'action', 'suspense', 'right', 'last', 'moment', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'good', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'leave', 'dissapointed.One', 'reservation', 'do', 'have', 'lack', 'extra', 'price', 'tag', 'are', 'only', 'given', 'smattering', 'trailers', 'movies', 'such', 'quot', 'From', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'quot', 'Still', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection']",N/A
823144,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,B00023GG9Y,"Deborah MacGillivray ""Author,""","[8, 9]","This movie is loaded with stars, Ian McShane, Ursula Andress, Beau Bridges (in the duo role) and Lloyd Bridges, Alan Hale Jr., Cornel Wilde, Rex Harrison, Olivia de Havilland and Jose Ferrer.  The costumes are scrumptious and the locale work all help this movie along.  It?s good to see the old 50s movie stars having one last swashbuckle!  Bridges is miscast and nearly sinks the movie, and the directing is stiff, but everyone does a good turn in the old Man in the Iron Mask story.  McShane seems to have fun as Fourquet.The much-filmed Dumas tale has the Philippe, twin brother of the King of France, raised and protected by the Musketeers.  Fourquet, acting for the King, has the twin arrested and hidden by the iron mask.  He plans to use the twin as a decoy in public, and kill him with a bomb.  Then when the King surprisingly survives the attempt, it?s supposed to make everything believe he is invincible.  Only the musketeer is Johnny-on-the-spot to foil the plot, save their ward and then pull the switch by stuffing Louis the King in the iron mask and place Philippe on the throne of France.It?s a good transfer.  Just a shame the younger Bridges hurt the effort in the dual role and the directing could not have been stronger.",4,"great cast, beautiful costumer that fizzles",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,1240,"['movie', 'loaded', 'stars', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'duo', 'role', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr.', 'Cornel', 'Wilde', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'Jose', 'Ferrer', 'costumes', 'are', 'scrumptious', 'locale', 'work', 'help', 'movie', 'along', 's', 'good', 'see', 'old', '50s', 'movie', 'stars', 'having', 'one', 'last', 'swashbuckle', 'Bridges', 'miscast', 'nearly', 'sinks', 'movie', 'directing', 'stiff', 'everyone', 'good', 'turn', 'old', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Mask', 'story', 'McShane', 'have', 'fun', 'Fourquet.The', 'much-filmed', 'Dumas', 'tale', 'Philippe', 'brother', 'King', 'France', 'raised', 'protected', 'Musketeers', 'Fourquet', 'acting', 'King', 'twin', 'arrested', 'hidden', 'iron', 'mask', 'use', 'twin', 'decoy', 'public', 'kill', 'bomb', 'Then', 'when', 'King', 'surprisingly', 'attempt', 's', 'supposed', 'make', 'everything', 'believe', 'invincible', 'Only', 'musketeer', 'Johnny-on-the-spot', 'foil', 'plot', 'save', 'ward', 'then', 'pull', 'switch', 'stuffing', 'Louis', 'King', 'iron', 'mask', 'place', 'Philippe', 'throne', 'France.It', 's', 'good', 'transfer', 'Just', 'shame', 'younger', 'Bridges', 'hurt', 'effort', 'dual', 'role', 'directing', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'stronger']",N/A

823146,A3Q61B02RGUUJW,B00023GG9Y,Joseph A. Admire,"[5, 5]","It's frankly beyond me why the so-called ""uncensored"" version has never been released in the U.S., even with this new DVD version.  I have seen the full-length version on Region 2 DVD (readily available for anyone with a DVD player capable of running Region 2 discs), and, as other reviewers have noted, the ""juicy"" scenes truly don't have anything that would be particularly shocking in this day and age. (If one considers the sight of the beauteous Ursula Andress and Sylvia Kristel in the nude to be a tremendous shock, one probably needs to get out more. :) ) More to the point, the uncut version (which, by the way, is available in English) makes more sense and flows better than the ""censored"" version - to the tune of 15 minutes' worth of additional footage, most of it _not_ sex-related.  Several important conversations, as another reviewer noted, are sliced up because one scene or another showing a little more of Kristel or Andress than was considered proper were removed to get a PG rating in the US.  A shame.If you can get ahold of the uncut version and can play it, do so.  This is quite a good movie with lots of good performances, including turns by several mainstays of classic Hollywood - the great Rex Harrison in one of his last roles and Olivia de Havilland as the mother of Louis XIV, to name two.  There's all the sword action you could expect from a Musketeers movie.  Andress drips sex and menace as the scheming mistress of King Louis, while Kristel (best known, of course, as Emmanuelle) is sweet and winsome as the Spanish princess dispatched to marry the King who ends up falling for his lookalike.  Beau Bridges makes a good foppish Louis, but I'm not sure he's quite dashing enough to play Philippe, the lookalike; however, he gives it the old college try and acquits himself decently.",4,"Good swashbuckler, but the ""uncensored"" version should have been released",1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1818,"['frankly', 'why', 'so-called', 'uncensored', 'version', 'never', 'been', 'released', 'U.S.', 'even', 'new', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'seen', 'full-length', 'version', 'Region', '2', 'DVD', 'readily', 'available', 'anyone', 'DVD', 'player', 'capable', 'running', 'Region', '2', 'discs', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'juicy', 'scenes', 'truly', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'shocking', 'day', 'age', 'one', 'sight', 'beauteous', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'Sylvia', 'Kristel', 'nude', 'be', 'tremendous', 'shock', 'one', 'probably', 'get', 'out', 'more', 'More', 'point', 'uncut', 'version', 'way', 'available', 'English', 'more', 'sense', 'better', 'censored', 'version', 'tune', '15', 'minutes', 'worth', 'additional', 'footage', 'most', 'sex-related', 'Several', 'important', 'conversations', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'are', 'sliced', 'one', 'scene', 'showing', 'little', 'more', 'Kristel', 'Andress', 'was', 'considered', 'proper', 'were', 'removed', 'get', 'PG', 'rating', 'US', 'A', 'shame.If', 'can', 'get', 'ahold', 'uncut', 'version', 'can', 'play', 'do', 'so', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'lots', 'good', 'performances', 'including', 'turns', 'several', 'mainstays', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'Rex', 'Harrison', 'one', 'last', 'roles', 'Olivia', 'de', 'Havilland', 'mother', 'Louis', 'XIV', 'name', 'two', 'sword', 'action', 'could', 'expect', 'Musketeers', 'movie', 'Andress', 'sex', 'menace', 'scheming', 'mistress', 'King', 'Louis', 'Kristel', 'best', 'known', 'course', 'Emmanuelle', 'sweet', 'winsome', 'Spanish', 'princess', 'dispatched', 'marry', 'King', 'who', 'up', 'falling', 'lookalike', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'good', 'foppish', 'Louis', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'quite', 'dashing', 'enough', 'play', 'Philippe', 'lookalike', 'however', 'old', 'college', 'try', 'decently']",N/A
823147,A1CA1A1MGW0I3J,B00023GG9Y,Raisuli the Magnificent,"[0, 0]","I saw this in the theatre on opening weekend many years ago.  I didn't like it then, and still don't like it.  I had a hard time understanding why an all star cast of older actors I recognized from many a 1960s TV show were in this film.  I got the fact that the musketeers were all supposed to be older, but I didn't understand why I didn't see I wasn't seeing the actors from the previous films in makeup to age them.It bothered me then, and even knowing what I know about money and budgets for flims...it still bothers me.  There was money for props, costumes, sets, and actors who had talent.  But the film didn't have the zest of the Salkind productions, and felt very flat in the end (which was exceptionally tragic).Fortunately there is a third installment using most of the orginal cast, and directed by Richard Lester no less, but it took lots of cajoling to get that production off the ground, and I'm sorry to say that it too is a bit flat, but it is by far a superior production to this film.See this film if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you.",2,Not even the Salkinds stoop this low.,1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,1063,"['saw', 'theatre', 'opening', 'weekend', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'why', 'star', 'cast', 'older', 'actors', 'recognized', 'many', '1960s', 'TV', 'show', 'were', 'film', 'got', 'fact', 'musketeers', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'older', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'seeing', 'actors', 'previous', 'films', 'makeup', 'age', 'them.It', 'bothered', 'then', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'know', 'money', 'budgets', 'flims', 'still', 'was', 'money', 'props', 'costumes', 'sets', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'talent', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'zest', 'Salkind', 'productions', 'felt', 'very', 'flat', 'end', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'tragic', '.Fortunately', 'third', 'installment', 'using', 'most', 'orginal', 'cast', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Lester', 'no', 'less', 'took', 'lots', 'cajoling', 'get', 'production', 'ground', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'say', 'too', 'bit', 'flat', 'far', 'superior', 'production', 'film.See', 'film', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'warn']",N/A
