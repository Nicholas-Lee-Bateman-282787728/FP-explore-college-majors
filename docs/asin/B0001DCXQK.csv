800761,A282A0P69UT137,B0001DCXQK,"Captain Hornblower ""captainhornblower""","[5, 5]","Farscape Season 4 got off to an incredibly rocky start with mediocre episodes like ""Crichton Kicks"" and ""What Was Lost"" Parts 1 and 2.  With the exceptions of ""Promises"" and ""I Shrink, Therefore I Am"", the rest of Season 4 up to this point was less than satisfying.  But with the episodes on this DVD edition, Season 4 finally gets interesting, and delivers some of the most intriguing, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally charged episodes of Farscape ever.""Unrealized Reality"" is a hard episode to wrap one's brain around, especially since Farscape does not normally go in for much techno-babble like other science fiction shows.  But there is a firm purpose behind it. The wormhole alien Crichton communicates with is trying to show the dangers of wormholes and how they can travel to not just different places in space, but different realities.  Altering those realities can have drastic consequences.  This episode really brings the whole wormhole arc running through the series to a full explanation, and is an important predecessor to the next episode.""Kansas"" sees Crichton and company pop out of a wormhole over Earth, but the year is 1985.  Warned by the wormhole alien that his mear presence in that time might change things, Crichton and his friends travel down to Earth to find out if things have been changed.  To his horror, Crichton finds that his Father is now set to be aboard the ill-fated shuttle Challenger, and must change things so he doesn't go.  The dramatic essence of this episode focuses on Crichton, with his attempt to change things back to how they should be, along with his confrontation with his former self and his late-Mother.  The comedic elements focus on how Crichton's friends encounter Earth and its customs for the first time, such as what they think the middle finger means and the correct use of the term ""bite me.""""Terra Firma"" has Crichton and crew return to Earth, but its Earth of the present.  Crichton is welcomed home as a hero, but his alien comrades are subjects of freak-show style fascination and suspiscion.  Crichton also finds that things are not the same as they were when he left Earth, as the writers brilliantly incorporate the aftermath of September 11 and how it has affected the points of view of the people Crichton left behind.  Aeryn also gets to meet Crichton's family, while trying to find a way to win back Crichton's trust and find out if he still loves her.  This episodes is an important one in Farscape's history because Crichton finally finds his way home, thus bringing an arc that has been present from the show's premiere to the forefront.""Twice Shy"" is a standard action-adventure episode, but is done quite well and the alien attacker is well developed and genuinely creepy.  Behind the action is emotional turmoil as Crichton and Aeryn finally begin to confront where they are, and what is REALLY holding them back.All in all, a great DVD edition to Farscape.",5,"Finally, Farscape Season 4 begins to deliver the goods!",1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,2947,"['Farscape', 'Season', '4', 'got', 'off', 'incredibly', 'rocky', 'start', 'mediocre', 'episodes', 'Crichton', 'Kicks', 'What', 'Was', 'Lost', '1', '2', 'exceptions', 'Promises', 'Shrink', 'Therefore', 'Am', 'rest', 'Season', '4', 'up', 'point', 'was', 'less', 'satisfying', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Season', '4', 'finally', 'interesting', 'most', 'intriguing', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'episodes', 'Farscape', 'ever', 'Unrealized', 'Reality', 'hard', 'episode', 'wrap', 'one', 'brain', 'around', 'especially', 'Farscape', 'not', 'normally', 'go', 'much', 'techno-babble', 'other', 'science', 'fiction', 'shows', 'firm', 'purpose', 'wormhole', 'alien', 'Crichton', 'communicates', 'trying', 'show', 'dangers', 'wormholes', 'how', 'can', 'travel', 'not', 'just', 'different', 'places', 'space', 'different', 'realities', 'Altering', 'realities', 'can', 'have', 'drastic', 'consequences', 'episode', 'really', 'whole', 'wormhole', 'arc', 'running', 'series', 'full', 'explanation', 'important', 'predecessor', 'next', 'episode', 'Kansas', 'Crichton', 'company', 'pop', 'wormhole', 'Earth', 'year', '1985', 'Warned', 'wormhole', 'alien', 'mear', 'presence', 'time', 'might', 'change', 'things', 'Crichton', 'friends', 'travel', 'down', 'Earth', 'find', 'out', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'horror', 'Crichton', 'Father', 'now', 'set', 'be', 'ill-fated', 'shuttle', 'Challenger', 'must', 'change', 'things', 'so', ""n't"", 'go', 'dramatic', 'essence', 'episode', 'Crichton', 'attempt', 'change', 'things', 'back', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'confrontation', 'former', 'self', 'late-Mother', 'comedic', 'elements', 'focus', 'how', 'Crichton', 'friends', 'encounter', 'Earth', 'customs', 'first', 'time', 'such', 'what', 'think', 'middle', 'finger', 'means', 'correct', 'use', 'term', 'bite', 'Terra', 'Firma', 'Crichton', 'crew', 'return', 'Earth', 'Earth', 'present', 'Crichton', 'welcomed', 'home', 'hero', 'alien', 'comrades', 'are', 'subjects', 'freak-show', 'style', 'fascination', 'suspiscion', 'Crichton', 'also', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'same', 'were', 'when', 'left', 'Earth', 'writers', 'brilliantly', 'incorporate', 'aftermath', 'September', '11', 'how', 'affected', 'points', 'view', 'people', 'Crichton', 'left', 'behind', 'Aeryn', 'also', 'meet', 'Crichton', 'family', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'win', 'back', 'Crichton', 'trust', 'find', 'out', 'still', 'important', 'one', 'Farscape', 'history', 'Crichton', 'finally', 'way', 'home', 'thus', 'bringing', 'arc', 'been', 'present', 'show', 'premiere', 'forefront', 'Twice', 'Shy', 'standard', 'action-adventure', 'episode', 'done', 'quite', 'well', 'alien', 'attacker', 'well', 'developed', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'action', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'Crichton', 'Aeryn', 'finally', 'begin', 'confront', 'where', 'are', 'what', 'REALLY', 'holding', 'back.All', 'great', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Farscape']",N/A

800764,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001DCXQK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 7]","On &quot;Farscape: Season 4, Collection 3&quot; we get to a point in the series where the show could have jumped the shark. After all, in the very first episode Commander John Crichton, out testing his new acceleration theory, is flung through a wormhole into a galaxy that is really far, far away, and for three-and-a-half seasons while dealing with Crais, Scorpius, and all the other problems (not to mention his crewmates on Moya) Crichton has been trying to find his way home. Well, on this DVD, we get to the episodes where he finds himself back home. Fortunately, the results are what fans of the series would hope for and, as we have come to expect, the proverbial much more.Episode 411, &quot;Unrealized Realities&quot; (Written by David Kemper, Aired August 23, 2002) sets the stage by having Crichton sucked through a wormhole where he gets interrogated by a being who has a connection to the Ancients. On the one hand we have semi-deep philosophical discussions about the nature of time and alternative realities, while on the other this is another episode where the &quot;Farscape&quot; cast get to play each other. These fit together because they are teaching Crichton the rules by which the wormholes operate, and this makes many things possible. So this episode not only stands on its own but at the end Crichton is floating above Earth.Episode 412, &quot;Kansas&quot; (Written by Justin Monjo, Air Date January 10, 2003) starts with Moya joining Crichton above Earth. The good news is Crichton is home, but the bad news is that he is fifteen years in the past and his father is about to commander the space shuttle Challenger on its ill-fated final voyage. The solution to this is for the aliens to hide out in an abandoned house while they try to fix the past. This means kidnapping the young John Crichton, in whom Chiani takes a helpful interest, and learning English so that they can explain things to the local cops. Then we get to the end and things get really interesting.Episode 413, &quot;Terra Firma&quot; (Written by Richard Manning, January 17, 2003) has Crichton finding out that the Earth has changed about as much as he has since he left. The show wisely takes 9/11 into account in the ways in which Crichton's family, friends, and government react to his return and his shipmates. But then there is also the Skreeth that Grayza has sent after Crichton and how our hero is bumping heads with his father over how the alien technology should be shared with Earth. I really wish this one should have been a two-parter or the start of more of a minor story arc.Episode 414, &quot;Twice Shy&quot; (Written by David Peckinpah, Aired January 24, 2003) is a letdown in comparison to the high drama of the other episodes. You have to get to the next disc and &quot;A Constellation of Doubt,&quot; which is the ideal episode to complete the Earth quartet. Chiana insists that Talikaa, a slave girl they encounter on a planet where they are making a trade, be bought and brought on Moya. This turns out to be a bad thing and a rather ordinary &quot;Farscape&quot; episode, although the setup for the next big twist in the story of John and Aeryn comes at the end of this one.Of course, we know that &quot;Farscape&quot; is going to get cancelled during the fourth season, which is rather infuriating when you see how the series is uping the ante at this point. Lots of things are falling into place for the finale story arc and you just want to enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts. You also want to make sure you are all caught up on &quot;Farscape&quot; before the mini-series on the Sci Fi Channel comes out this fall.",5,"Apparently John can go home again, along with Moya's crew",1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,3643,"['quot', 'Farscape', 'Season', '4', 'Collection', '3', 'quot', 'get', 'point', 'series', 'where', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'jumped', 'shark', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'Commander', 'John', 'Crichton', 'testing', 'new', 'acceleration', 'theory', 'flung', 'wormhole', 'galaxy', 'really', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'three-and-a-half', 'seasons', 'dealing', 'Crais', 'Scorpius', 'other', 'problems', 'not', 'mention', 'crewmates', 'Moya', 'Crichton', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'Well', 'DVD', 'get', 'episodes', 'where', 'back', 'home', 'Fortunately', 'results', 'are', 'what', 'fans', 'series', 'would', 'hope', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'proverbial', 'much', 'more.Episode', '411', 'quot', 'Unrealized', 'Realities', 'quot', 'Written', 'David', 'Kemper', 'Aired', 'August', '23', '2002', 'stage', 'having', 'Crichton', 'sucked', 'wormhole', 'where', 'interrogated', 'being', 'who', 'connection', 'Ancients', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'semi-deep', 'philosophical', 'discussions', 'nature', 'time', 'alternative', 'realities', 'other', 'episode', 'where', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'get', 'play', 'other', 'fit', 'together', 'are', 'teaching', 'Crichton', 'rules', 'wormholes', 'operate', 'many', 'things', 'possible', 'So', 'episode', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'end', 'Crichton', 'floating', 'Earth.Episode', '412', 'quot', 'Kansas', 'quot', 'Written', 'Justin', 'Monjo', 'Air', 'Date', 'January', '10', '2003', 'Moya', 'joining', 'Crichton', 'Earth', 'good', 'news', 'Crichton', 'home', 'bad', 'news', 'fifteen', 'years', 'past', 'father', 'commander', 'space', 'shuttle', 'Challenger', 'ill-fated', 'final', 'voyage', 'solution', 'aliens', 'hide', 'out', 'abandoned', 'house', 'try', 'fix', 'past', 'kidnapping', 'young', 'John', 'Crichton', 'whom', 'Chiani', 'helpful', 'interest', 'learning', 'English', 'can', 'explain', 'things', 'local', 'cops', 'Then', 'get', 'end', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'interesting.Episode', '413', 'quot', 'Terra', 'Firma', 'quot', 'Written', 'Richard', 'Manning', 'January', '17', '2003', 'Crichton', 'finding', 'out', 'Earth', 'changed', 'as', 'much', 'left', 'show', 'wisely', '9/11', 'account', 'ways', 'Crichton', 'family', 'friends', 'government', 'react', 'return', 'shipmates', 'then', 'also', 'Skreeth', 'Grayza', 'sent', 'Crichton', 'how', 'hero', 'bumping', 'heads', 'father', 'how', 'alien', 'technology', 'should', 'be', 'shared', 'Earth', 'really', 'wish', 'one', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'two-parter', 'start', 'more', 'minor', 'story', 'arc.Episode', '414', 'quot', 'Twice', 'Shy', 'quot', 'Written', 'David', 'Peckinpah', 'Aired', 'January', '24', '2003', 'letdown', 'comparison', 'high', 'drama', 'other', 'episodes', 'have', 'get', 'next', 'disc', 'quot', 'Constellation', 'Doubt', 'quot', 'ideal', 'episode', 'complete', 'Earth', 'quartet', 'Chiana', 'Talikaa', 'slave', 'girl', 'encounter', 'planet', 'where', 'are', 'making', 'trade', 'be', 'bought', 'brought', 'Moya', 'out', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'setup', 'next', 'big', 'twist', 'story', 'John', 'Aeryn', 'end', 'one.Of', 'course', 'know', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'going', 'get', 'cancelled', 'fourth', 'season', 'rather', 'infuriating', 'when', 'see', 'how', 'series', 'uping', 'ante', 'point', 'Lots', 'things', 'are', 'falling', 'place', 'finale', 'story', 'arc', 'just', 'want', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'as', 'long', 'also', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'quot', 'Farscape', 'quot', 'mini-series', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'out', 'fall']",N/A
