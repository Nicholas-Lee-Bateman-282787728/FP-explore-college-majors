1353763,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,B003LR5BDK,A. Boston,"[23, 27]","I watched this movie for two reasons: We love True Blood and never miss an episode, and since Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer are featured on the cover, I was interested to see more of their acting. Secondly, because I work in Real Estate and thought the open house premise would be fun. Like an open house that doesn't just go bad, it goes slasher bad, awesome!Sadly, it was a boring, run of the mill home invasion slasher/thriller. Anna Paquin was in the movie for 30 seconds, Stephen Moyer for about 5 minutes tops. After checking out the back and seeing Open House was directed by Andrew Paquin, both of those cameos now make sense. What better way to draw in all those True Blood fans then to have these two on the cover?The movie just slowly progressed, the acting was fine but not impressive. The directing was typical, nothing wrong with it. The story has already been done time and again, and they missed the opportunity to explore some unique aspects of the characters. No scares, regular amount of spurting blood. I love scary movies, I'm not a big critic. I expect some entertainment, that's about it.

1353766,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B003LR5BDK,Anthony Pittore,"[3, 5]","Brian Geraghty (`The Hurt Locker') and Tricia Helfer (`Battlestar Galactica') star as a couple looking for their perfect home. Unlike the rest of us, they don't use real estate agents or the classifieds. Instead, they find the home they want and murder anyone in their path to getting it. This time around, the unlucky homeowner is Alice (Rachel Blanchard of `Snakes on a Plane'). Things get complicated (well, more complicated than things usually are for a pair of roaming serial killers) when David (Geraghty) decides to spare the life of Alice, unbeknownst to his partner in crime & love, Lila (Helfer). As Lila spins further & further down the drain of insanity, David begins to regret his decisions and considers making a life change, hopefully with the companionship of his newfound obsession Alice. `True Blood' stars Anna Paquin (whose brother Andrew wrote/directed) and Stephen Moyer also co-star in small roles.Marketing in the film industry is a fickle friend. It can make a film and it can destroy it. Look, for example, at a film like `Cloverfield' from a few years ago. What may have been just a small passing at the box office turned into a worldwide phenomenon, mostly thanks to some phenomenal viral marketing that truly sparked the interest the film needed. With `Open House,' however, it seems as if marketing is going to very much hurt the film. Why? Because they're setting the film up in a way that will only disappoint a great load of people. Those people are fans of the hit HBO series `True Blood.' Looking at the cover art for `Open House,' we are shown the main stars of `True Blood' Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer right up in the foreground with their names smack dab on the top for all to see. The problem with this, however, is both actors combined probably have under ten minutes of total screentime. While I wasn't bothered much by this since I didn't see the cover art prior to the film, I can see why many fans of the show will be annoyed when the two main reasons they sought out the film are gone before they even get the chance to fully settle into their sofa.Moving past what is sure to be a disappointing part of the film, there are several elements that I quite enjoyed about this little thriller. The most alluring factor of `Open House' and one that was truly impressive would be the performances. I was impressed by just about every actor's work throughout the film, especially that of Rachel Blanchard and Brian Geraghty, who after `The Hurt Locker' deserves to be doing bigger & better films than this. Another strong technical aspect of this film was the cinematography. Joseph White, who made his mark with his photography on `Repo! The Genetic Opera,' did very well simultaneously capturing the beautiful architecture of the house along with the gloom of the basement `prison.'One more talent associated with this film is the director, Andrew Paquin. I didn't cite his role as the writer with that compliment because I believe that is where he and the film failed most. As a director, he did a very fine job, especially for his rookie outing. The script, however, is what needed work. While the dialogue and plot were satisfactory enough, the real problem came from the constant wasted chances at real suspense. Rookie directors often run into problems when they direct their own work because they sometimes can't see the problems that another director or co-writer would see during pre-production or filming. A writer may read through his own script ten times, know it word for word, but not see a small flaw that a person may catch on their first run through. That is why another creative mind working on the script is almost always useful, especially in small productions like this.Overall, `Open House' is not going to go on as one of the great thrillers of our time. It will, like many straight-to-video films before it, most likely be forgotten by this time next year. However, for a one-night stand with an entertaining rental, you can do a lot worse than Andrew Paquin's first attempt. I'd like to see more in his future.Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,"A good-looking thriller with solid performances, but an underwhelming script",1281312000,"08 9, 2010",2010,4101,"['Brian', 'Geraghty', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Tricia', 'Helfer', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'star', 'couple', 'looking', 'perfect', 'home', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'real', 'estate', 'agents', 'classifieds', 'Instead', 'find', 'home', 'want', 'murder', 'anyone', 'path', 'getting', 'time', 'around', 'unlucky', 'homeowner', 'Alice', 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'Snakes', 'Plane', 'Things', 'get', 'complicated', 'well', 'more', 'complicated', 'things', 'usually', 'are', 'pair', 'roaming', 'serial', 'killers', 'when', 'David', 'Geraghty', 'spare', 'life', 'Alice', 'unbeknownst', 'partner', 'crime', 'love', 'Lila', 'Helfer', 'Lila', 'further', 'further', 'down', 'drain', 'insanity', 'David', 'regret', 'decisions', 'considers', 'making', 'life', 'change', 'hopefully', 'companionship', 'newfound', 'obsession', 'Alice', 'True', 'Blood', 'stars', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'brother', 'Andrew', 'wrote/directed', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'also', 'co-star', 'small', 'roles.Marketing', 'film', 'industry', 'fickle', 'friend', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'can', 'destroy', 'Look', 'example', 'film', 'Cloverfield', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'What', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'small', 'passing', 'box', 'office', 'turned', 'worldwide', 'phenomenon', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'phenomenal', 'viral', 'marketing', 'truly', 'sparked', 'interest', 'film', 'needed', 'Open', 'House', 'however', 'marketing', 'going', 'very', 'much', 'hurt', 'film', 'Why', ""'re"", 'setting', 'film', 'up', 'way', 'will', 'only', 'disappoint', 'great', 'load', 'people', 'people', 'are', 'fans', 'hit', 'HBO', 'series', 'True', 'Blood', 'Looking', 'cover', 'art', 'Open', 'House', 'are', 'shown', 'main', 'stars', 'True', 'Blood', 'Anna', 'Paquin', 'Stephen', 'Moyer', 'right', 'up', 'foreground', 'names', 'smack', 'dab', 'top', 'see', 'problem', 'however', 'actors', 'combined', 'probably', 'have', 'ten', 'minutes', 'total', 'screentime', 'was', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'cover', 'art', 'prior', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'annoyed', 'when', 'two', 'main', 'reasons', 'sought', 'out', 'film', 'are', 'gone', 'even', 'get', 'chance', 'fully', 'settle', 'sofa.Moving', 'what', 'sure', 'be', 'disappointing', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'elements', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'little', 'thriller', 'most', 'alluring', 'factor', 'Open', 'House', 'one', 'was', 'truly', 'impressive', 'would', 'be', 'performances', 'was', 'impressed', 'just', 'actor', 'work', 'film', 'especially', 'Rachel', 'Blanchard', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'who', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'deserves', 'be', 'doing', 'bigger', 'better', 'films', 'strong', 'technical', 'aspect', 'film', 'was', 'cinematography', 'Joseph', 'White', 'who', 'made', 'mark', 'photography', 'Repo', 'Genetic', 'Opera', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'simultaneously', 'capturing', 'beautiful', 'architecture', 'house', 'gloom', 'basement', 'prison', ""'One"", 'more', 'talent', 'associated', 'film', 'director', 'Andrew', 'Paquin', 'did', ""n't"", 'cite', 'role', 'writer', 'compliment', 'believe', 'where', 'film', 'failed', 'most', 'director', 'did', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'especially', 'rookie', 'outing', 'script', 'however', 'what', 'needed', 'work', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'were', 'satisfactory', 'enough', 'real', 'problem', 'came', 'constant', 'wasted', 'chances', 'real', 'suspense', 'Rookie', 'directors', 'often', 'run', 'problems', 'when', 'direct', 'own', 'work', 'sometimes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'problems', 'director', 'co-writer', 'would', 'see', 'pre-production', 'filming', 'writer', 'may', 'read', 'own', 'script', 'ten', 'times', 'know', 'word', 'word', 'not', 'see', 'small', 'flaw', 'person', 'may', 'catch', 'first', 'run', 'why', 'creative', 'mind', 'working', 'script', 'almost', 'always', 'useful', 'especially', 'small', 'productions', 'this.Overall', 'Open', 'House', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'one', 'great', 'thrillers', 'time', 'will', 'many', 'straight-to-video', 'films', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'forgotten', 'time', 'next', 'year', 'However', 'one-night', 'stand', 'entertaining', 'rental', 'can', 'do', 'lot', 'worse', 'Andrew', 'Paquin', 'first', 'attempt', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'future.Final', 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",N/A

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","While the first 20 minutes of Open House may be completely forgettable and the low budget acting during this period may lead one to think the movie will be a total disaster, I'm happy to report it's actually a pretty decent film after all.  For some reason the presentation and the sound quality is less than spectacular, but that may be due to my TV.  Who knows.  I don't believe so but I could be wrong.Anyway Open House is about a demented, murderous man (Brian Geraghty) and his wife that take over a house that the owner (played by Rachel Blanchard) is looking to sell after a divorce with her husband.  They actually kidnap Rachel and lock her in the basement however... the wife doesn't know this.  She assumes Brian killed Rachel's character and threw her in the basement freezer with the other people they've relentlessly killed... but he didn't.  What a twisted story, huh!And... for the most part, the movie is a success.  At least in my opinion.  I'm apparently in the minority.  One thing that's notable to me is Brian Geraghty's character.  He's REALLY good in his role.  He never shows any emotion, never cracks a smile, and believes that he and his wife have a special connection meant to kill others.  The killings themselves are exceptionally gruesome too.  There's never any hesitation or second guessing- they immediately walk up to the victims and kill them as aggressively as one can imagine.  However there's a problem.  Brian has an attraction to Rachel's character -the girl he locked in the basement without telling his wife- so instead of killing her he throws her in the baseball wall, chains her up and hides her from his wife.Throughout the movie Brian occasionally let's Rachel out whenever his wife leaves and without spoiling what happens, let's just say it becomes an exciting movie from this point forward.  Of course Rachel tries to run away whenever the moment seems right but... well you know.  If she got away we wouldn't have a movie to watch would we?  It's critical to look beyond the first 20 minutes of horribly clich&eacute;d writing however.  The segment with Brian's wife seducing a man in the swimming pool is more reminiscent of an adult movie which could lead viewers into thinking Open House is too unacceptable to watch (on a couple different levels) however the movie probably is worth your time- you just have to give it a chance.

The rub comes from the fact that he couldn't do so and, instead, has her bound in a storage place in the basement unbeknownst to his partner. Of course his captive wants to escape and strikes up a rudimentary relationship with him to try and do so.

You are given barely more info, then if you read in a paper: &#34;Last night, on the south side of town, six people were killed, cut up, and placed into coolers.  Police found the bodies at 7 am, this morning in a garage, at 6243 W. mangrove Ct.&#34;  I've made up the time and place because I don't think were ever told that- But it was close to Beverly Hills, Ca.So I'll give you some facts about the plot.

They kill the owner(s) and anyone that gets in the way.B) The two have a bit of a mental link [that will be explained].C) She will leave during the day and somehow makes money.

The other actors were unknown to me, and if I'd realized that ""Rachel Blanchard"" was NOT ""Tammy Blanchard,"" whose work I enjoy, I probably would not have clicked over to rent this one.

1353781,A387BD735MI50R,B003LR5BDK,R. Schultz,"[12, 13]","This doesn't have quite the plot that the DVD jacket suggests. Just skimming the jacket blurb, you might think this movie will be about a maniac or two taking up residence in the basement of a house for sale, then creeping out at night after new occupants have taken up residence there. That sounded like a promising premise that plays into a glancing fear many of us might have when we consider buying a house. Did the realtor conscientiously check all the basement cubbyholes, all the closets before locking up after every Open House?But no, that isn't quite what this movie is about. If anything, it's a reversal of that more predictable theme. In this case, the sociopaths blatantly occupy the body of the house, while the rightful owner gets imprisoned in the basement, left to haunt and perhaps ultimately challenge the intruders.This is a movie of few words, at least on the part of the male sociopath. There is no burden of back-story here, no Psycho-like epilogue neatly explaining the psychopaths' behavior. This vicious duo dwells in existential space, isolated in their clean, white, new surroundings. The male is a silhouette as he sits on the couch, limned by the sunlight coming in through the window behind. These two drop in from their own universe, reminiscent of the evil that descends in the notable German film, ""Funny Games."" In this case though, one of the intruders has the redeeming capacity to feel some affection, some empathy.But the film's overall silences are what make it more memorable than the average maniacs-amok film. It has a trance-like, fairy-tale quality that draws the viewer into its silent spaces, that invites the viewer to fill the vacuums.""Open House"" does include something of a twist. An additional turn of the screw in the already corkscrew psyches of the two home invaders is revealed. The acting in this film is good enough though that you might guess this twist from the beginning. It is always suggested, so it isn't dragged in like a bolt from the blue.There's a Director/Actor commentary included in this DVD that doesn't add much to our sense of the characters' motivations, but that supplies some easy, supplemental listening. Well wait - not quite. It's not quite ""easy listening."" Brian Geraghty, the actor who plays the male psychopath in ""Open House"" occasionally punctuates the commentary with some shadings of dissatisfaction and even askew anger of his own that seem to be reflections, albeit pale reflections, of the attitude of his fictional character. Having come off his starring role in the acclaimed movie ""The Hurt Locker,"" he seems to imply he didn't want to do this lesser film. He wasn't happy. He wouldn't have done it except... This element of undercutting blends in with the cutting and undercutting that goes on in the movie itself. Altogether, the quiet abberations on this DVD make this movie disquieting - and strangely fascinating.",4,"For Sale - 3 Bedroom, 1 Basement Prison Cubicle",1281916800,"08 16, 2010",2010,2913,"[""n't"", 'have', 'quite', 'plot', 'DVD', 'jacket', 'Just', 'skimming', 'jacket', 'blurb', 'might', 'think', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'maniac', 'two', 'taking', 'up', 'residence', 'basement', 'house', 'sale', 'then', 'creeping', 'out', 'night', 'new', 'occupants', 'have', 'taken', 'up', 'residence', 'there', 'sounded', 'promising', 'premise', 'glancing', 'fear', 'many', 'might', 'have', 'when', 'consider', 'buying', 'house', 'Did', 'realtor', 'conscientiously', 'check', 'basement', 'cubbyholes', 'closets', 'locking', 'up', 'Open', 'House', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'anything', 'reversal', 'more', 'predictable', 'theme', 'case', 'sociopaths', 'blatantly', 'occupy', 'body', 'house', 'rightful', 'owner', 'imprisoned', 'basement', 'left', 'haunt', 'perhaps', 'ultimately', 'challenge', 'intruders.This', 'movie', 'few', 'words', 'least', 'part', 'male', 'sociopath', 'burden', 'back-story', 'here', 'Psycho-like', 'epilogue', 'neatly', 'explaining', 'psychopaths', 'behavior', 'vicious', 'duo', 'dwells', 'existential', 'space', 'isolated', 'clean', 'white', 'new', 'surroundings', 'male', 'silhouette', 'couch', 'limned', 'sunlight', 'coming', 'window', 'two', 'drop', 'own', 'universe', 'reminiscent', 'evil', 'notable', 'German', 'film', 'Funny', 'Games', 'case', 'one', 'intruders', 'redeeming', 'capacity', 'feel', 'affection', 'empathy.But', 'film', 'overall', 'silences', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'more', 'memorable', 'average', 'maniacs-amok', 'film', 'trance-like', 'fairy-tale', 'quality', 'viewer', 'silent', 'spaces', 'viewer', 'fill', 'vacuums', 'Open', 'House', 'include', 'something', 'twist', 'additional', 'turn', 'screw', 'already', 'corkscrew', 'psyches', 'two', 'home', 'invaders', 'revealed', 'acting', 'film', 'good', 'enough', 'might', 'guess', 'twist', 'beginning', 'always', 'suggested', ""n't"", 'dragged', 'bolt', 'blue.There', 'Director/Actor', 'commentary', 'included', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'sense', 'characters', 'motivations', 'easy', 'supplemental', 'listening', 'Well', 'wait', 'not', 'quite', 'not', 'quite', 'easy', 'listening', 'Brian', 'Geraghty', 'actor', 'who', 'male', 'psychopath', 'Open', 'House', 'occasionally', 'commentary', 'shadings', 'dissatisfaction', 'even', 'askew', 'anger', 'own', 'seem', 'be', 'reflections', 'pale', 'reflections', 'attitude', 'fictional', 'character', 'Having', 'come', 'off', 'starring', 'role', 'acclaimed', 'movie', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'imply', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'do', 'lesser', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'happy', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'element', 'undercutting', 'blends', 'cutting', 'undercutting', 'movie', 'Altogether', 'quiet', 'abberations', 'DVD', 'make', 'movie', 'disquieting', 'strangely', 'fascinating']",N/A
