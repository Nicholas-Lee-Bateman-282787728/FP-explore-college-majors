By glory I mean that only Russian TV can show how things really were that were based on books, facts. If the movie was done by any Hollywood, it would be a real American outlook on what Russia is. As the one to know Russian history deep enough I admit the movie depicts it in a full glory. Mystical things in a movie, not a fairy tale. It is a soul of Russia. A part of it's soul. The old man who chained himself and was carrying a cross depicts the true Russian soul. He may be old and everything but believe me I have seen a lot of unexplained things from that country and I am not afraid to admit that it is mighty. As every country it has it's black and white. But when the Phoenix rises once again, you will be blinded by it's light. And also made me think of why there is some people out there who hate the country? So they do not accept it's culture, or don't like other things about it. They say dirty things about the country and it's people and yet they anger the people, they go into a war and lose it. Why not to be angry even more after all this? And it made me think of another very common thing I see everywhere(starting from Europe and going everywhere else). People hate the Mighty Russia. But when time comes, everyone acts like a coward and claim to be Russian. If they have a dirty habits(and I seen those people and heard of them), they claim to be Russians, but when they act normal and have to prove nothing they are f.ex. Polish, and whatever. Now you ask how is it connected with a movie? Watch it for yourself(you won't regret it) and maybe it gives you questions as well as answers for these and other Q. and A. And just for the fact Russia went through a lot and I don't judge anymore why some people are a bad example. For any bad there is always some good. My advice for all of you is to get some Russian history books. There is a lot of interesting facts in there. Certainly you didn't know a lot about it. And I am sure of that. Be curious, and search. There is a lot to learn about what Russia is.",5,Interesting..it made me think a lot about today and the past,1307232000,"06 5, 2011",2011,2108,"['great', 'experience', 'see', 'great', 'Russian', 'history', 'early', 'glory', 'glory', 'mean', 'only', 'Russian', 'TV', 'can', 'show', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'were', 'were', 'based', 'books', 'facts', 'movie', 'was', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'American', 'outlook', 'what', 'Russia', 'one', 'know', 'Russian', 'history', 'deep', 'enough', 'admit', 'movie', 'full', 'glory', 'Mystical', 'things', 'movie', 'not', 'fairy', 'tale', 'soul', 'Russia', 'A', 'part', 'soul', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'chained', 'was', 'carrying', 'cross', 'true', 'Russian', 'soul', 'may', 'be', 'old', 'everything', 'believe', 'have', 'seen', 'lot', 'unexplained', 'things', 'country', 'am', 'not', 'afraid', 'admit', 'mighty', 'country', 'black', 'white', 'when', 'Phoenix', 'once', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'blinded', 'light', 'also', 'made', 'think', 'why', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'country', 'do', 'not', 'accept', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'other', 'things', 'say', 'dirty', 'things', 'country', 'people', 'yet', 'anger', 'people', 'go', 'war', 'lose', 'Why', 'not', 'be', 'angry', 'even', 'more', 'made', 'think', 'very', 'common', 'thing', 'see', 'everywhere', 'starting', 'Europe', 'going', 'everywhere', 'else', 'People', 'hate', 'Mighty', 'Russia', 'when', 'time', 'everyone', 'acts', 'coward', 'claim', 'be', 'Russian', 'have', 'dirty', 'habits', 'seen', 'people', 'heard', 'claim', 'be', 'Russians', 'when', 'act', 'normal', 'have', 'prove', 'nothing', 'are', 'f.ex', 'Polish', 'Now', 'ask', 'how', 'connected', 'movie', 'Watch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 'answers', 'other', 'Q.', 'A', 'just', 'fact', 'Russia', 'went', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'anymore', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'bad', 'example', 'bad', 'always', 'good', 'advice', 'get', 'Russian', 'history', 'books', 'lot', 'interesting', 'facts', 'there', 'Certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'lot', 'am', 'sure', 'Be', 'curious', 'search', 'lot', 'learn', 'what', 'Russia']",1612

1226890,A1248JRIINWRTH,B001PCNZEU,"Angela Wilson ""I love books & DVDs!""","[2, 3]","This rich, bloody film about Russia's Time of Trouble is an incredible epic that history buffs, war and action film fans will heartily embrace. it is a definite keeper - one I plan to watch several times over.I thought 1612 would be a nightmare to review. I don't like subtitles. I don't typically care for period epics. Plus, the several of the last foreign films I reviewed were just a waste of my time.Based on true events, this film from Russian director Vladimir Khotineko blew me away. Not once did I take my eyes off the screen. The story was engrossing, the filming great, the acting fantastic. Everything combined into a dynamite picture that immediately stoked my interested in Russia's Time of Trouble.Tsar Boris Godunov and his family are murdered. His beautiful daughter, Princess Ksenia, is spared by the Polish Hetman, who is obsessively in love with her. He plans to marry her to capture the Russian throne.A young man who had a school boy crush on the princess sets out to rescue her - and save Russia from doom. He is deeply religious, worshipping the treasured unicorn horn broken from one of the palace gates before the princess was taken. (The unicorn was revered by mystics during this time.) He prays to God always for strength.Andrey is a barge puller - super strong men who literally pulled barges across the river. They were beaten and bloodied from mistreatment. He escapes his chains and gets to see the princess on a barge he is towing with others.After his punishment for daring to set eyes on royalty, a Spanish trader purchases Andrey. He makes a friend. When the trader is murdered, Andrey assumes his identity and the ghost of the man teaches him how to fight with a sword.These mystical lessons will prove invaluable when Andrey comes face-to-face with the evil Hetman.1612 is one of the best period films I've seen in a long, long time. Andrey's journey reminded me a bit of Braveheart - he would never give up and never give in. He had a duty and he would fulfill it - death be damned.The film was rich in history. It was incredibly clever, the way filmmakers blended modern items with the 17th century so that viewers didn't notice it (unless you know the date the first cannon is used).One thing in this film I have never seen are warriors with wings. The bad guys have these soldiers who wear wing-like backs to their armor. I'm trying to find some historical documents about this - if it is true and which army had them. I believe it was the Polish Army that had them in this film. The closest thing I've found are hussars of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The photograph with this article has a uniform similar to that of the warriors in 1612: [...].I thought this story must be close to history. However, brilliant director Khotinenko says it is fiction based on the real death of Tsar Godunov in 1605 and all the trouble that followed. What he created was pretty damn close to the truth - with a few modern touches that give the story flare for action film lovers.Here is what I have extrapolated from Wikipedia and a few other sources: Godunov had a tough reign, with terrible harvests, freezing temperatures and economic woes. Godunov was the brother-in-law of Tsar Ivanovich of the Rurik Dynasty. He was a boyar - a Russian aristocrat - and members of the Romanov family - and throughout the nation - felt he was beneath the throne.Several tried to take over the throne. These guys were called False Dmitriys. They claimed to be rightful heirs. Eventually, Poland took control and the Polish king decides to take Russia's thrown so they could all become Roman Catholics. This did not sit well with the people, who turned their backs on Catholicism shoved down their throats and became anti-Polish.During this time, several men of God would go to the mountaintops and stand, weighed down by chains, and pray for their nation. They would not come down - or sit down - until the Time of Trouble was finished.All of this is highlighted in Khotinenko's film. He pulls it brilliantly together through the eyes of Andrey (also spelled ANDREI).In an ironic twist, the princess - who has developed a semi-crush on Andrey - is sent away to a convent. Andrey's friends create a fake ID to make him look like a true heir to the throne - just like the False Dimitriys he wanted out of Russian. Andrey takes the high road, admitting that he is a mere serf and Russia eventually goes to the Romanovs - who are eventually murdered during another cold-blooded royal killing.The DVD extras include a Making Of 1612 that is a much watch. I was nearly as fascinated by this peek into the filmmaking as I was the film itself.For instance, the barge the men were pulling at the beginning of the film was supposed to move with motors. However, the motors would not run. The actors ended up pulling it themselves and got it in one shot. Amazing dedication you would not find in spoiled Tinsel Town, where actors think doing their own ""stunts"" makes them special.Also featured in the extras are special effects. They show how they created the scene where the Hetman is killed by a sword going down his throat. The Russians did not waste time and money on boring CGI images. They used props to create an incredibly realistic, bloody kill. Their innovation is fantastic to watch.There were times when there were subtitles in both English AND Russian - I believe they were speaking French and Spanish during these times. For a girl who isn't into subtitles, this didn't bother me a bit. In fact, I thought it was kind of cool.1612 is a great movie. You are not tied to the subtitles to understand what is happening on screen. You get it. The battle scenes are bloody - more realism and less gore than you see in American films. It is a fantastic watch - one you may find yourself drawn to over and over again.",5,Great epic,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,5833,"['rich', 'bloody', 'film', 'Russia', 'Time', 'Trouble',

Why these production choices were made in what is apparently supposed to be a critical turn of events in the history of Russia is unclear, but the reason for making the film seems to be to out-Hollywood Hollywood without the benefit of CGI that serve as Hollywood's main 'character' in epics of this sort.Apparently from the title we are to accept this tale as a recreation of the death of Boris Fyodorovich Godunov  (1551 - 1605)  - de facto regent of Russia from 1584 to 1598 and then the first non-Rurikid tsar from 1598 to 1605. The end of his reign and the murder of his son saw Russia descend into the Time of Troubles.  There was a witness to these murders, one Andrei (Pytor Kislov) who fell into serfdom and then into being a mercenary with his friend Kostka (Artur Smolyaninov) for the Polish hetman (Michal Zebrowsski).  Apparently one Godonov remained, the Tsarina Kseniya (Violetta Davydovskaya) and was loved by both the Polish hetman and by Andrei.  The entire film is an extended battle between the Polish and the Russians for the control of Moscow and the dream of the Polish hetman to marry Kseniya and ascend the throne as the new Tsar.  The referenced year 1612 is the year of the Battle for Moscow when the Poles were successfully defeated making way for the rise of the Romanovs as the royal family of Russia.Somewhere well hidden in this collage of decapitations and other examples of battlefield mayhem are the identities of the characters who populate this story, but the tale is so chopped up by amazingly bad editing (to the point that the film feels like there are large gaps missing as the screen simply goes dark frequently), by flights of fantasy that focus on a unicorn, moments when the past is recalled through the use of pixels of supposedly previously viewed material, and just plain lapses in plot details that the movie appears like a richly colorful blood bath with some unintentional (?) comedic moments.  The machinations of the battle between the winged Poles and the oh-so-inventive Russians fighting against all odds border on absurd.  But then perhaps that is the point of the film: war is madness and kingdoms are built by serendipity.  It is a long song and tedious, but if you know the realities of Russian history it may be a very entertaining movie!

1226910,A376UHS8GODI8W,B001PCNZEU,Patrick Selitrenny,"[7, 10]","I like it, but I don't like it...Funny, but true. As a modern action movie it stands at par with other similar stuff that even Hollywood manages to produce (see ""300"").Not so much for special visual effects, of which there are virtually none, except for the occasional battle scene, but rather for the silliness in language and story development.It is a simple fun movie. One for popcorn chewing moviegoers.Unpretentious and yet captivating in its silliness.At times, while watching it, I was reminded of movies of yesteryear, such as Errol Flynn's escapades in ""The Black Hawk"" or more recently Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow's shenanigans in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".Costumes and settings are gorgeous though, and even the music is pleasant and appropriate for a movie of this type. But let's face it,it's just another cape and dagger movie, not really Russian history as it pretends to be.Sure, there are hints to that (and many, but then again distributed freely throughout, without an actual chronology). All we get to know is that after Czar Boris Godunov's demise and that of his entire family (but one surviving Princess), there is a period of anarchy in Russia.Add to this the ever-lasting ""bad"" Polish invader, riding in with very fanciful armor which sports applied feather wings (actually an accurate depiction, but just reserved for the Royal Polish Guards of that time and only worn during parades, never in battle - for obvious reasons) and you have Holiday on Ice.True to history is the fact that after the fall of Czar Boris, Russia had been literally invaded by opportunistic tradesmen from everywhere in Europe. This has been simplified and centered around a central Hispanic figure, represented by a mercenary, and apparently, former Conquistador.The reality though was different, and the so-called invasion was far less pervasive and intrusive. Europe simply needed new trade routes through Russia and did indeed send out emissaries for this purpose.Yet then the entire story goes through a mystic development, even involving unicorns and a mysterious Hermit chained on a pole in the midst of a forest. It may be significant for Russians but for a foreign audience who may not know all the symbolic significances of this, it still remains a puzzle to the end of the movie.As said, as an entertainment movie, not too bad, but as a pretense in historic fact it really leaks all over.The actors, probably all unknown to the Western world are all competent, especially in secondary roles and do their job quite convincingly. The action scenes (battles, swordplay, fights, etc.) are all very well choreographed and at times, even spectacular.But does this mishmash stand for something?Not really.Not even as other reviewers have stated, as a propaganda movie for the Medvevev / Putin duo.If it is true that this movie was pushed by the Kremlin itself, then the taste of this entity has considerably diminished since Stalin's times.But such are the times we are living in.Not wanting the invasion of Western culture in their Country, in that sense at least, it is utterly a wasted effort, since this movie proves without a doubt that they have already been ""contaminated"" by this - bad taste - kind of trendy movie.What next? Japanese ""Animes"" to entertain the masses in Russia too?At least Stalin had Eisenstein to propagate his views, and those movies have become true Classics.But ""1612""? Forgettable at best.Being of Russian descent myself, I regret this popularization in Russian history. Why can't we have true historic, if not epic movies about the true history of Russia?The theme alone, Boris Godunov, already made famous by a well-known Opera, should entice any film-maker deserving this definition, to make an extra effort and develop a true biopic around this figure.But not just limited to this period.All we have are just excerpts from Russian history. We never get the whole picture. What about the first Viking invasion of Russia, when it was still unknown under that name? In fact Russia takes the name from the first Conquerors of the land, which the native population named ""Rus"" after their reddish scalps and beards.What ever happened between the Era of Boris and that of Peter the Great? Who were the various successors, what did they do, what have they achieved, how long did they all rule? These are all still unanswered questions that no one ever bothered to tackle with in any serious form.I only wished that the new generation of movie-makers in Russia, but not just limited to Russia, would actually have that kind of culture and wisdom as to come up with some more original stuff than your average Action movie.This DVD is no exception (I own three copies of it. One is the U.S. version, available here. One bought in France and one bought in Germany).I wanted to test if there was actually a difference among versions, but there were none.They all run at an approximate length of two hours and twenty-four minutes. There are virtually no special features (except on the French copy, which has ""The Making of"" feature).The sound for all three is in DD 5.1 in Russian. The German copy gets an additional language track in German (also DD 5.1), while the other two versions only come with subtitles in their relative languages (the U.S. version in English and the French, obviously in French).The image is crystal clear, although a bit too bright for my taste (but this may depend on how the movie was originally filmed).There are absolutely no differences among the copies. The NTSC or region 1 copy, is exactly the same as the ones in PAL or region 2 code.But as said, this is just an great spectacle entertainment with a pretense to be a historic movie, not truly a classic, and far, far away of true classiccinematography a la Tarkovsky or Eisenstein. If you are looking for that kind of style, you're light years away.I can only recommend it for a very young and inexperienced audience, and just as an approach to adventure movies.For those who are demanding, you better buy something else, hoping that someone else makes the extra effort to finally come up with a series of movies which deal in true and serious historic fact about Russian history, instead of wanting to simplify it for the masses.In my view, it just deserves 2 out of 5 stars, due to the effort made by all those involved in making it, but none should be given to the finished product which is offensively populist and to a degree as to be talking down at people that may know more about movies and history as well, than moviemakers these days.",2,He likes me...

Here we have an amazing film, based upon the turbulent early history of civilized Russia.The infamous and nefarious Tsar Ivan the Terrible is dead and a string of leadership figures ensue, all of which leads to innumerable bloody battles, including lots of swordplay. Eventually, the Poles attempt to seat a Tsar for the Russian homeland but this prospect doesn't fly very well with the home boys, (which might serve to partially explain why the Poles eventually became the whipping boys of the Russians, clear into the Soviet years.)You'll find the cinematography of this excellent Russian film to be first-class and the action pretty much never ends. It's not an English language film but the English subtitles are spot-on and quite easy to digest.

1226912,A11HB3LYLIQNZP,B001PCNZEU,"PhiloX ""PhiloX""","[12, 13]","I watched the movie 1612 in Russian with no sub titles in PAL format when I was in Ukraine during the summer of 2008. I know very little Russian therefore I had to go by the action of the movie & ask questions along the way. Basically the movie was about the time when the Czar's seat was empty after the death of Czar Boris Godunov. The Polish-Lithuanian government/army with the help of the Roman Catholic church moved into the political vacuum & tried to influence Russian culture, religion, & political leadership. The hero of the story Andrey was once a friend of Princess Ksenia, the daughter of Godunov, who was taken as a political prisoner by the Polish-Lithuanians & Andrey was made into a slave or serf. Later when they see each other from a distance, Andrey has himself sold to a Spanish Mercenary who is hired by the Polish-Lithuanian army to perfect their cannons. Later the Spanish Mercenary teaches Andrey to fight & when the Spanish Mercenary meets an untimely death, Andrey pretends to be the Spaniard. The story continues with a love triangle & large battle for the city of Moscow.The year 1612 is to Russians as 1776 is to Americas: freedom from an outside power & development of ones own cultural identity & purpose. The Unicorn seen in the movie is a symbol of old Russia before the Double Eagle symbol of the Czar & is shown several times as a dream scene to convey what was lost & could be regained.The war scenes are top notch with lots of stand-ins with fantastic Polish-Lithuanian Calvary with angel wings. The movie does get a little bloody during the battle scenes, but isn't that real war?History versus Movie Making: In the movie the Russians are defending Moscow from the Polish-Lithuanian army, but historically the Russians attacked a Polish-Lithuanian garrison within the Kremlin because the Polish-Lithuanians were already in Moscow.Controversy: the movie was commissioned by the Kremlin & may hold certain Russian political ideals because it was released on November 1, 2007 to help with the new ""National Unity Day"" to celebrate the retreat of the Polish-Lithuanian troops from Moscow around November 4, 1612. This new holiday replaces the old Soviet November 7 celebration of the 1917 Revolution.Rating PG-13 or R?: Russian films don't go by our system of rating. There is some female nudity in the movie when young Andrey sees the princess take a bath with her female court, but the scene is not too offence. Normally any movie about war will included a certain level of violence which should be considered.What makes this movie so profound is the portray of a Starets, which is a Russian Orthodox spiritual director who normally is clairvoyant, who is also a Stylites, which is a Christian ascetic who stands on a pillar preaching, fasting, & praying. One day a Roman Catholic monk who is clean shaven with a crown hair cut, a finely dressed cowl, & who is the advisor from the Pope to help the Polish-Lithuanians against the Russians, comes across the Russian Starets who tells him to pick up his cross which are contain in a basket. This changes the Roman Catholic monk who then becomes a wandering hermit & when he returns to Rome with ragged clothes & full beard, the Pope almost faints.There are still Starets in Russia as well in other parts of the world including America, but a Stylite ended in the mid 1400's in Russia. Therefore to join both concepts of Orthodox monasticism in the 1600's is not historically possible but makes a good movie image. To see what comes close to a real Starets see the Russian film Ostrov (The Island).",4,There is More than a PAL,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,3582,"['watched', 'movie', '1612', 'Russian', 'sub', 'titles', 'PAL', 'format', 'when', 'was', 'Ukraine', 'summer', '2008', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Russian', 'therefore', 'had', 'go', 'action', 'movie', 'ask', 'questions', 'way', 'Basically', 'movie', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Czar', 'seat', 'was', 'empty', 'death', 'Czar', 'Boris', 'Godunov', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'government/army', 'help', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'church', 'moved', 'political', 'vacuum', 'tried', 'influence', 'Russian', 'culture', 'religion', 'political', 'leadership', 'hero', 'story', 'Andrey', 'was', 'once', 'friend', 'Princess', 'Ksenia', 'daughter', 'Godunov', 'who', 'was', 'taken', 'political', 'prisoner', 'Polish-Lithuanians', 'Andrey', 'was', 'made', 'slave', 'serf', 'Later', 'when', 'see', 'other', 'distance', 'Andrey', 'sold', 'Spanish', 'Mercenary', 'who', 'hired', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'army', 'perfect', 'cannons', 'Later', 'Spanish', 'Mercenary', 'teaches', 'Andrey', 'fight', 'when', 'Spanish', 'Mercenary', 'meets', 'untimely', 'death', 'Andrey', 'be', 'Spaniard', 'story', 'love', 'triangle', 'large', 'battle', 'city', 'Moscow.The', 'year', '1612', 'Russians', '1776', 'Americas', 'freedom', 'outside', 'power', 'development', 'ones', 'own', 'cultural', 'identity', 'purpose', 'Unicorn', 'seen', 'movie', 'symbol', 'old', 'Russia', 'Double', 'Eagle', 'symbol', 'Czar', 'shown', 'several', 'times', 'dream', 'scene', 'convey', 'what', 'was', 'lost', 'could', 'be', 'regained.The', 'war', 'scenes', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'lots', 'stand-ins', 'fantastic', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'Calvary', 'angel', 'wings', 'movie', 'get', 'little', 'bloody', 'battle', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'real', 'war', 'History', 'versus', 'Movie', 'Making', 'movie', 'Russians', 'are', 'defending', 'Moscow', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'army', 'historically', 'Russians', 'attacked', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'garrison', 'Kremlin', 'Polish-Lithuanians', 'were', 'already', 'Moscow.Controversy', 'movie', 'was', 'commissioned', 'Kremlin', 'may', 'hold', 'certain', 'Russian', 'political', 'ideals', 'was', 'released', 'November', '1', '2007', 'help', 'new', 'National', 'Unity', 'Day', 'celebrate', 'retreat', 'Polish-Lithuanian', 'troops', 'Moscow', 'November', '4', '1612', 'new', 'holiday', 'old', 'Soviet', 'November', '7', 'celebration', '1917', 'Revolution.Rating', 'PG-13', 'R', 'Russian', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'system', 'rating', 'female', 'nudity', 'movie', 'when', 'young', 'Andrey', 'princess', 'take', 'bath', 'female', 'court', 'scene', 'not', 'too', 'offence', 'Normally', 'movie', 'war', 'will', 'included', 'certain', 'level', 'violence', 'should', 'be', 'considered.What', 'movie', 'so', 'profound', 'portray', 'Starets', 'Russian', 'Orthodox', 'spiritual', 'director', 'who', 'normally', 'clairvoyant', 'who', 'also', 'Stylites', 'Christian', 'ascetic', 'who', 'pillar', 'preaching', 'fasting', 'praying', 'One', 'day', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'monk', 'who', 'clean', 'shaven', 'crown', 'hair', 'cut', 'finely', 'dressed', 'cowl', 'who', 'advisor', 'Pope', 'help', 'Polish-Lithuanians', 'Russians', 'Russian', 'Starets', 'who', 'pick', 'up', 'cross', 'are', 'contain', 'basket', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'monk', 'who', 'then', 'wandering', 'hermit', 'when', 'Rome', 'ragged', 'clothes', 'full', 'beard', 'Pope', 'almost', 'are', 'still', 'Starets', 'Russia', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'parts', 'world', 'including', 'America', 'Stylite', 'ended', 'mid', '1400', 'Russia', 'Therefore', 'join', 'concepts', 'Orthodox', 'monasticism', '1600', 'not', 'historically', 'possible', 'good', 'movie', 'image', 'see', 'what', 'close', 'real', 'Starets', 'see', 'Russian', 'film', 'Ostrov', 'Island']",1612

1226915,A2ULQOGN59LDNK,B001PCNZEU,Richard J. Brzostek,"[129, 136]","1612 takes place during the time of troubles in Russia and is loosely based on history.  It could be called the ""time of troubles"" not only because a foreign army is occupying the country, but also because there isn't clear leadership to bring them out of the mess.  The film doesn't try to be a strict historical film but an adventure that will capture the hearts of the audience.  The movie mixes history with mystical and legendary elements; namely, one reoccurring subject is that of unicorns.  Even with that said, I could say with a straight face that it doesn't go too far with this into fairly tale land as most parts with unicorns are in dreams or visions.Polish invaders murdered the royal family but the Polish Hetman (Michal Zebrowski) spared the life of Princess Kseniya, whom he loves and sees as a way to become Czar himself.  Andrei (Pyotr Kislov), who also loves Kseniya, ends up as a servant and then mercenary of the Polish Hetman, witnessed the murders and makes it his goal to overthrow the invaders and free the Princess.  The love triangle between the three is the crux of much of the conflict.The villains of this story are the Poles, who wear armor with wings giving them the look of angels, but they strike with fierceness that is more demonic than angelic.  Interestingly enough, the Polish Hetman is actually a famous Polish actor, which adds a bit to the realism to the film.  To some degree this film is anti-Polish in nature and is not entirely historically accurate but we are reminded that this movie isn't a documentary from time to time by the unicorns.  Even with that said, I still think the movie is a lot of fun.1612 rivals the best historical films in both story and special effects.  The action doesn't slow down between the duels, skirmishes, and sieges.  I think 1612 particularly excels in showing cannon warfare, in which there is quite a bit of in this movie.  I would say 1612 would get an ""R"" rating by American standards for showing some nudity and quite a bit of violence that doesn't spare us the goriness of war.",5,1612 mixes history with mystical and legendary elements,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,2064,"['1612', 'place', 'time', 'troubles', 'Russia', 'loosely', 'based', 'history', 'could', 'be', 'called', 'time', 'troubles', 'not', 'only', 'foreign', 'army', 'occupying', 'country', 'also', ""n't"", 'clear', 'leadership', 'bring', 'mess', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'strict', 'historical', 'film', 'adventure', 'will', 'capture', 'hearts', 'audience', 'movie', 'mixes', 'history', 'mystical', 'legendary', 'elements', 'namely', 'one', 'reoccurring', 'subject', 'unicorns', 'Even', 'said', 'could', 'say', 'straight', 'face', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'fairly', 'tale', 'land', 'most', 'parts', 'unicorns', 'are', 'dreams', 'visions.Polish', 'invaders', 'murdered', 'royal', 'family', 'Polish', 'Hetman', 'Michal', 'Zebrowski', 'spared', 'life', 'Princess', 'Kseniya', 'whom', 'way', 'become', 'Czar', 'Andrei', 'Pyotr', 'Kislov', 'who', 'also', 'Kseniya', 'up', 'servant', 'then', 'mercenary', 'Polish', 'Hetman', 'witnessed', 'murders', 'goal', 'overthrow', 'invaders', 'free', 'Princess', 'love', 'triangle', 'three', 'crux', 'much', 'conflict.The', 'villains', 'story', 'are', 'Poles', 'who', 'wear', 'armor', 'wings', 'giving', 'look', 'angels', 'strike', 'fierceness', 'more', 'demonic', 'angelic', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Polish', 'Hetman', 'actually', 'famous', 'Polish', 'actor', 'bit', 'realism', 'film', 'degree', 'film', 'anti-Polish', 'nature', 'not', 'entirely', 'historically', 'accurate', 'are', 'reminded', 'movie', ""n't"", 'documentary', 'time', 'time', 'unicorns', 'Even', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun.1612', 'rivals', 'best', 'historical', 'films', 'story', 'special', 'effects', 'action', ""n't"", 'slow', 'down', 'duels', 'skirmishes', 'sieges', 'think', '1612', 'particularly', 'excels', 'showing', 'cannon', 'warfare', 'quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'would', 'say', '1612', 'would', 'get', 'R', 'rating', 'American', 'standards', 'showing', 'nudity', 'quite', 'bit', 'violence', ""n't"", 'spare', 'goriness', 'war']",1612

There is quite a lot of graphic violence in the battle scenes of this film (on the level of ""Braveheart""); so you should probably skip it if you hate carnage. The battle scenes between the (brave, freedom-loving) Russians and the Polish Army are quite well done.As the movie begins, Tsar Boris Godunov and all but one of his family have been murdered, causing Russia to descend into leaderless chaos. The story follows Andrei, the hero, as he tries to track down Princess Ksenia, the Tsar's only surviving child (a beautiful daughter, of course).

There is this thing about Russia - its ability to suffer through and survive - all the while being true to its faith in Orthodoxy and the national character it produced. This movie is a product of the relatively restored Russia which looks on its national past and is encouraged by its faith and perseverance. The legend and fantasy of the Unicorn are placed in the film confusing some - but if one looks closely the mystical use of that animal in the film serves a purpose. It is the symbolic image of the purity of the Russian faith in its God - capable of healing wounds deeply inflicted by foreign invasions and local treachery. The battle scenes are realistic and serve at times as a diversion to the director's true purpose - to show that faith in the Nation and the nation's God will overcome all adversity. In the end, the Czar triumphs and the era of the Romanoff's begins. One comes away with the feeling that the whole story is an attempt to set the stage for a restoration in modern day Russia of the old order.

The assassination of Tsar Boris Gudunov, his young wife, and his son and heir has thrown Russia into a relentless power struggle.

1226921,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B001PCNZEU,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This film is set at the beginning of the 17th century when Russia had a severe crisis over who was to inherit the throne after the Tsar died. There are many contenders but none too genuine. This was called the time of `chaos' as the people are leaderless, and the Poles had invaded Russia. Their Hetman (Michel Zebrowski) has captured the Tsarina Kseniya Godunova. He has fallen in infatuation with her and sees marriage to her as a way to legitimise his false claim to the throne.  Throw into the mix a lowly serf Andrei played by Pyotr Kislov, he really does love the Tsarina and through guile and cunning sets about saving her and in the long run, Russia too.The opening sequences start in 1605 and we get a pocket `history' lesson to take us up to date. This is not a true history lesson though and quite happily mixes up faith, mysticism and myth with all the action. We have a holy man who won't come down from his tree until the chaos has ended, lots of iconography (very Russ indeed) and a recurring theme of Unicorns.  Whilst we are thrown into the current plight of the characters, the missing detail is told in vivid flashback, so by about half way through you get to understand the real histories of those involved and the attraction Andrei has for the Tsarina.This has been criticised for being anti -Polish, well of course it is, this is a Russian film and the Poles are the enemy. They do get the best costumes though, they are all armoured up and wear wings to give them the look of avenging angels. That is one of the many strengths of this film, the costumes are stunning. Add to that the overall excellent cinematography and attention to detail and this makes for a real visual feast.There is buckets of action too and it is done really well, the CGI that had to be used in places is so good that you really don't notice and as good special effects should do, it actually adds to the emotional upsurge that was intended.  Look out for the siege sequences, they are brilliant. My only complaint is around the subtitles, not everything is translated especially the Italian parts; and on occasion the Russian translation is over the English translation, making it virtually impossible to read.That aside, this is a rollercoaster of a film, with action, intrigue, romance and a ruddy great story with excellent performances all round. Vladimir Khotinenko has done a masterful job in the direction of this film, and at 143 minutes has done superbly to keep the momentum up throughout. If you like action films based on historical events, then you will not be disappointed. If you want a history lesson this is not for you, but I thought it was just excellent and intend to watch again very soon.",5,Fantastic Russian Historical Actioner,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,2709,"['film', 'set', 'beginning', '17th', 'century', 'when', 'Russia', 'had', 'severe', 'crisis', 'who', 'was', 'inherit', 'throne', 'Tsar', 'died', 'are', 'many', 'contenders', 'none', 'too', 'genuine', 'was', 'called', 'time', 'chaos', 'people', 'are', 'leaderless', 'Poles', 'had', 'invaded', 'Russia', 'Hetman', 'Michel', 'Zebrowski', 'captured', 'Tsarina', 'Kseniya', 'Godunova', 'fallen', 'infatuation', 'marriage', 'way', 'legitimise', 'false', 'claim', 'throne', 'Throw', 'mix', 'lowly', 'serf', 'Andrei', 'played', 'Pyotr', 'Kislov', 'really', 'love', 'Tsarina', 'guile', 'cunning', 'sets', 'saving', 'long', 'run', 'Russia', 'too.The', 'opening', 'sequences', 'start', '1605', 'get', 'pocket', 'history', 'lesson', 'take', 'up', 'date', 'not', 'true', 'history', 'lesson', 'quite', 'happily', 'mixes', 'up', 'faith', 'mysticism', 'myth', 'action', 'have', 'holy', 'man', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'down', 'tree', 'chaos', 'ended', 'lots', 'iconography', 'very', 'Russ', 'indeed', 'recurring', 'theme', 'Unicorns', 'are', 'thrown', 'current', 'plight', 'characters', 'missing', 'detail', 'told', 'vivid', 'flashback', 'so', 'half', 'way', 'get', 'understand', 'real', 'histories', 'involved', 'attraction', 'Andrei', 'Tsarina.This', 'been', 'criticised', 'being', 'anti', '-Polish', 'well', 'course', 'Russian', 'film', 'Poles', 'are', 'enemy', 'do', 'get', 'best', 'costumes', 'are', 'armoured', 'up', 'wear', 'wings', 'give', 'look', 'avenging', 'angels', 'one', 'many', 'strengths', 'film', 'costumes', 'are', 'stunning', 'Add', 'overall', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'attention', 'detail', 'real', 'visual', 'feast.There', 'buckets', 'action', 'too', 'done', 'really', 'well', 'CGI', 'had', 'be', 'used', 'places', 'so', 'good', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'as', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'should', 'do', 'actually', 'emotional', 'upsurge', 'was', 'intended', 'Look', 'out', 'siege', 'sequences', 'are', 'brilliant', 'only', 'complaint', 'subtitles', 'not', 'everything', 'translated', 'especially', 'Italian', 'parts', 'occasion', 'Russian', 'translation', 'English', 'translation', 'making', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'read.That', 'aside', 'rollercoaster', 'film', 'action', 'intrigue', 'romance', 'ruddy', 'great', 'story', 'excellent', 'performances', 'round', 'Vladimir', 'Khotinenko', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'direction', 'film', '143', 'minutes', 'done', 'superbly', 'keep', 'momentum', 'up', 'like', 'action', 'films', 'based', 'historical', 'events', 'then', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'want', 'history', 'lesson', 'not', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'excellent', 'intend', 'watch', 'again', 'very', 'soon']",1612
