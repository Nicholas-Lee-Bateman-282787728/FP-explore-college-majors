1505366,A3L9ICGBXMLR5I,B005Y1B3JW,P. Fitzgerald,"[3, 5]","Picked randomly from the Pay-Per-View menu, UNDOCUMENTED is my surprise find of the year.  I hesitate to call it my pleasant surprise, because while the discovery of a true horror gem flying under the radar can really warm my cockles, once the action here gets rollin', I was feeling more cold chills than warm fuzzies.What starts off as a fairly routine shot-on-video, found footage movie quickly turns into a visceral and all-too-believable nightmare of American patriotism run amok. Our heroes and the immigrants they were following have been captured by a group of extreme nationalists who are looking to save our country by cleansing of the scourge that's ruining it. In other words, undocumented Mexicans sneaking over the border.What really drove this home for me was how possible every horrific image or idea you're subjected is.  As a country, we seem to have lost our minds on this subject. The inhuman acts going on right now in Arizona are not that far off from what's happening at the abandoned slaughterhouse in the movie.  As a matter of fact, I wouldn't be surprised if something like is actually was going on...right now.  Our villains here are not raving madmen.  On the contrary, they are well spoken....charming, even...guys you'd probably love to have a beer with sometime in other circumstances.  These men spill poison from their mouths, calmly. Rationally.  Indeed, there might be a nugget of truth to it; a truth twisted into something hideous, but truth nonetheless.  And part of me started to believe it.

1505367,A1536VSPC386SQ,B005Y1B3JW,"The Hermit ""The Hermit""","[2, 6]","The film Undocumented remains right now one of the most fascinating 'little known'movies I have viewed this year , and next year I am pretty convinced it's going to be amongst the as of then months' new cult classics. The film is not an attempt to attack patriotism per ce. It observes patriotism from a lot of angles and not just one or two angles. The film deals with the consequences of why the Obama administration and other U.S. administrations had left American Civilians and worked against U.S. interests in such terms as with immigration policies and especially people who have been termed illegal immigrants. In my country there are no borders so I don't know with absolute certainty what it's like to live in a place with borders. Following the flawed policy of centralizing everything , the Obama Administrations decides to declare on it's own terms who are to be it's allies in battling the problem of 'illegal immigration'to the point that it keeps losing rather than gaining any votes. Despite requests to leave and have themselves replaced by authentic individuals representing those who would elect them to run for themselves rather than to run for persons supporting themselves with private funding while they'd remain in office , the characters representing the Obama Administration tried everything in their power to prevent any real change to occur , resulting in the downfall of the Obama administration and everything it had claimed officially to stand for. The end of the Obama administration had come shortly after the Obama characters had come to power , and faced with the overwhelming presence of extreme and furious anger by the American People , the Obama Admin cared for nothing and no one , and kept staying in power , with the official explanation being that they were doing it 'to preserve the interests of their supporters and the American People', with the American People already not wanting them to be in power. Hatred , corruption and fear are believed by many to be amongst the many trademarks that stand for the current Obama administration , in light of how it has behaved in regard to U.S. interests and the American People. It's undeniable state of undeniable denial is already there before the world to see , and that denial to confront reality and resign from power has caused them to throw themselves into a lake of fire from which there will be no turn - the fire of ceaseless and merciless criticism. Understandably a lot of militias and individuals opposing tyrannical government and opression have come together to stop the overwhelmness the Obama Administration has tried to enforce upon the American People against their will , while refusing to listen to public demands and resign or face impeachment. Indefinite Intention and the seizure of farms were just two of the numerous things which would never have happened in America if there were not so many idiots allowing that to happen. But it happened. It is as it is and so people respond with uprising. In many ways this films reminds me a bit of Salo , or 120 Days of Sodom , but is in certain areas a bit more brutal , more intense , and more shocking. Perhaps it is after having watched Salo a few times one starts getting used to it and can share it with other members of one's family who will usually remain stiff with fear upon having watched it for the first time. The end of the Obama administration is no longer 'around the corner'. It's time for the Obama administration to face this end , because that end is the consequences of self - inflicted wounds. Society has changed. Zionism and extremist centrist politics are no longer tolerated. What the Bushes had hoped for , 'the NWO'has failed to manifest itself as an idea because the presence of intelligent people in this world is far more tangible than they'd have liked to believe , whether their supporters like it or not. Undocumented turned out surprisingly good in my opinion - it filled me with a sense of much inner strength I had felt I had been missing during the past days (I'm an artist and a writer). The message of this film is plain and clear; the Earth doesn't have to be made into a place where everyone wants to leave. Let's make the Earth a place where as many as possible will want to stay on - or Terra , as I guess the Earth will be called increasingly.......our planetary home , without any need for everything to be centralized. I am truly sorry that my comment is rather awkard , but I give this film five stars. Well done. Extremely good job. After the film ended I wondered what it'd be like if somebody from another planet would threat people from Earth as 'illegal immigrants'if they got helped to arrive to that planet.......where they will be the aliens.",5,Destined to be a Cult Classic!!,1332547200,"03 24, 2012",2012,4752,"['film', 'Undocumented', 'remains', 'right', 'now', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', ""'little"",

1505368,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B005Y1B3JW,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","This film really surprised me, because I usually hate these found footage films. Aside from the nausea, caused by the constant movement of the camera, I find that these films not only lack a budget, but also a decent story and cast. Undocumented was different though, as it was a novel idea with some fairly stable camera work. The story focuses on a group of college kids, making a documentary about illegal aliens, and how they cross into the United States. The group join a coyote for a run across the boarder when they are unexpectedly capture. Unfortunately for them, their captors aren't the police, but rather a group of self-proclaimed patriots, who abuse the illegal immigrants for their sick pleasure. We see a lot of films about how and why people cross the boarder and even a lot about what the police and government are doing about it, but I can't ever remember seeing a film about these vigilante groups, that do exist, and pray on illegals. Prison Break's Pete Stormare stars as Z, the leader of the rebel group and he basically makes the movie. This guy usually plays a gangster or inmate in the background of some random film or TV show, but he's never really the star, and it's a shame because he makes this movie. Z is such a deep character, who is brilliant yet deranged at the same time, a man who is as compassionate as he is brutal, it was really something to see. He's paired with a young cast of teen actors, who have been around for years, and who do a terrific job in support of his performance. This film isn't listed as a horror film, but it is pretty brutal and bloody, meaning you shouldn't watch it if you have a weak stomach. For me, it was an interesting take on an aspect of immigration that is rarely seen or talked about. The performances were impressive, the characters were deep, and the film never stops moving. I enjoyed the fact that this unique film really didn't have any big named stars in it and even though it had a shoe-string budget, the producers really made it work.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,2017,"['film', 'really', 'surprised', 'usually', 'hate', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'Aside', 'nausea', 'caused', 'constant', 'movement', 'camera', 'find', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'lack', 'budget', 'also', 'decent', 'story', 'cast', 'Undocumented', 'was', 'different', 'though', 'was', 'novel', 'idea', 'fairly', 'stable', 'camera', 'work', 'story', 'group', 'college', 'kids', 'making', 'documentary', 'illegal', 'aliens', 'how', 'cross', 'United', 'States', 'group', 'coyote', 'run', 'boarder', 'when', 'are', 'unexpectedly', 'capture', 'Unfortunately', 'captors', 'are', ""n't"", 'police', 'rather', 'group', 'self-proclaimed', 'patriots', 'who', 'abuse', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'sick', 'pleasure', 'see', 'lot', 'films', 'how', 'why', 'people', 'cross', 'boarder', 'even', 'lot', 'what', 'police', 'government', 'are', 'doing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'remember', 'seeing', 'film', 'vigilante', 'groups', 'do', 'exist', 'pray', 'illegals', 'Prison', 'Break', 'Pete', 'Stormare', 'Z', 'leader', 'rebel', 'group', 'basically', 'movie', 'guy', 'usually', 'gangster', 'inmate', 'background', 'random', 'film', 'TV', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'star', 'shame', 'movie', 'Z', 'such', 'deep', 'character', 'who', 'brilliant', 'yet', 'deranged', 'same', 'time', 'man', 'who', 'as', 'compassionate', 'brutal', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'see', 'paired', 'young', 'cast', 'teen', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'who', 'do', 'terrific', 'job', 'support', 'performance', 'film', ""n't"", 'listed', 'horror', 'film', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'bloody', 'meaning', 'should', ""n't"", 'watch', 'have', 'weak', 'stomach', 'was', 'interesting', 'take', 'aspect', 'immigration', 'rarely', 'seen', 'talked', 'performances', 'were', 'impressive', 'characters', 'were', 'deep', 'film', 'never', 'moving', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'unique', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'big', 'named', 'stars', 'even', 'had', 'shoe-string', 'budget', 'producers', 'really', 'made', 'work']",Undocumented
