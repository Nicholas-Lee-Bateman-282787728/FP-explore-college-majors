A movie with surprising heart and interesting situations between the characters. A big plus is that we visit Mexico and DO NOT have an evil Mexican crime lord 'Jefe'. The villain is American! Sort of a Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn, a role he handles superbly. The movie is a little long at parts (like the serenading dinner or the trips to the bus stop), but has a great conclusion that satisfies.",4,Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn,1334880000,"04 20, 2012",2012,481,"['Got', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'always', 'good', 'see', 'carry', 'movie', 'movie', 'surprising', 'heart', 'interesting', 'situations', 'characters', 'big', 'plus', 'visit', 'Mexico', 'DO', 'NOT', 'have', 'evil', 'Mexican', 'crime', 'lord', 'villain', 'American', 'Sort', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'role', 'superbly', 'movie', 'little', 'long', 'parts', 'serenading', 'dinner', 'trips', 'bus', 'stop', 'great', 'conclusion', 'satisfies']",Puerto Vallarta Squeeze
971610,A17W36X7XYEG0N,B000EBGFS6,"Bookworm ""Pandora""","[3, 4]","I didn't expect much of this little movie. I just wanted to see it because it was one of the last films Jonathan Brandis would ever make. For such a small part, he is remarkable and regrettably there's not enough of him here. It's a surprisingly good film. Scott Glenn and Harvey Keitel are great as they always are. Craig Wasson was nice to see since I hadn't seen anything since his over the top performance in Body Double. The film is well written and well acted. Though it did have some shocking moments. Scott Glenn at his age is well preserved and I nearly fell onto the floor during the scene where he's wearing a string bikini. It was nice to see Jonathan Brandis as a wet behind the ears CIA hitman-in-training and a future replacement for the Scott Glenn's seemingly doomed Price. He looked very tired in this movie or was it just me? There's some shocking and notable scenes, this movie is not for the prudish at heart. Though there is a sex scene and visible nudity, the scene is tastefully done and conveys a sense of tender regard between the two characters of Luz and Price. There is notable violence and I came away from this movie with the sense that if you're ever stupid enough to go to Mexico, you should hire a bodyguard, preferrably one who can kill with his hands. All in all this was better than some of the swill that gets the studio treatment. So I highly recommend this if you're a fan of lush Mexican locales and actors who act for the pure joy of acting and not a paycheck. My summary: CIA hitman (Glenn) with emotional scars kills unintended target, gets trapped, needs help getting across the border and hires a down on his luck American writer and his beautiful but gutsy Mexican girlfriend with scars of her own. CIA handler on his trail with CIA hitman in training and heir apparent to Glenn's Price. Price, writer, girlfriend get into some nasty scrapes (terrifying scene involving local police), body count escalates, disagreements and suspicion about Price ensue, cameo by Vicki Carr, girlfriend and Price get close, (too close). CIA handler and trainee close in with one of the most tense and surprising endings I've seen in a while.

971614,A2T049UQONS0OY,B000EBGFS6,Larry VanDeSande,"[7, 9]","Usually these unknown direct to video flicks don't have much going for them other than formulaic plot and maybe a few stars. Both those elements are apparent in ""Puerto Vallarte Squeeze"" (cast includes Scott Glenn, Harvey Keitel, Miguel Sandoval, Craig Wasson and Giovanna Zacar&iacute;as) but this movie has good action, believable acting and an outstanding script that only one time goes off into predictably silly behavior.The movie itself is a pretty typical action-suspenser. Glenn goes down to Mexico and kills a couple guys for revenge, then makes a deal with Wasson and girlfriend Zacarias to help him escape. The trio are pursued by cops including American Keitel -- who is very poorly directed and whose role is overly mechanical and macho -- and a Mexcican crew led by Sadoval. A chase ensues, along with some other predictable and unpredictable action, before our film comes to a familiar and somewhat foretold conclusion.I didn't have high hopes for this movie and it exceeded my expectations in everything but the cardboard characterization Keitel got stuck with. Scott Glenn gives a typical low-key performance and is countered by Wasson, who gives a heart of sleeve performance when stressed. The girlfriend seems to moderate the two extremes and is a nice makeweight for their combat.I'd recommend this movie to anyone that likes any of the actors, action, suspense, or simple film enjoyment. This movie is about as unpretentious as they come and is has a very intelligent script that keeps you involved all the way. I wish Keitel's character had been written better but the movie overcomes that brief problem, aided in large part by sweeping Mexican (probably Californian) vistas in many scenes.Note: this movie is also known as ""Puerto Vallarte"".",4,Good action film with an intelligent script,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,1765,"['Usually', 'unknown', 'direct', 'video', 'flicks', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'going', 'other', 'formulaic', 'plot', 'maybe', 'few', 'stars', 'elements', 'are', 'apparent', 'Puerto', 'Vallarte', 'Squeeze', 'cast', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', 'Craig', 'Wasson', 'Giovanna', 'Zacar', 'iacute', 'movie', 'good', 'action', 'believable', 'acting', 'outstanding', 'script', 'only', 'one', 'time', 'off', 'predictably', 'silly', 'behavior.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'typical', 'action-suspenser', 'Glenn', 'down', 'Mexico', 'couple', 'guys', 'revenge', 'then', 'deal', 'Wasson', 'girlfriend', 'Zacarias', 'help', 'escape', 'trio', 'are', 'pursued', 'cops', 'including', 'American', 'Keitel', 'who', 'very', 'poorly', 'directed', 'role', 'overly', 'mechanical', 'macho', 'Mexcican', 'crew', 'led', 'Sadoval', 'chase', 'other', 'predictable', 'unpredictable', 'action', 'film', 'familiar', 'somewhat', 'foretold', 'conclusion.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'everything', 'cardboard', 'characterization', 'Keitel', 'got', 'stuck', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'typical', 'low-key', 'performance', 'countered', 'Wasson', 'who', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'performance', 'when', 'stressed', 'girlfriend', 'moderate', 'two', 'extremes', 'nice', 'makeweight', 'combat.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'actors', 'action', 'suspense', 'simple', 'film', 'enjoyment', 'movie', 'as', 'unpretentious', 'come', 'very', 'intelligent', 'script', 'involved', 'way', 'wish', 'Keitel', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'better', 'movie', 'brief', 'problem', 'aided', 'large', 'part', 'sweeping', 'Mexican', 'probably', 'Californian', 'vistas', 'many', 'scenes.Note', 'movie', 'also', 'known', 'Puerto', 'Vallarte']",Puerto Vallarta Squeeze
971615,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000EBGFS6,Pork Chop,"[4, 5]","Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, is a dark, conspiracy-laden movie, tellinga story that seems somewhat over-worked (considering the author feltthe need to have one of the protagonists profession be that of afamed book writer).It will also probably be of interest mostly to military veterans,who can relate to the post-traumatic stress syndrome thatcharacterizes literally 100's of thousands of former personnel inthe well documented conflicts of Vietnam, and some of former covertoperatives of the CIA, as played by Scott Glenn, in this picture.Apart from the interesting filmed aspects  of small-towns acrossNorthern Mexico, this picture also emphasizes its rural aspects andabandoned villages, that obviously, are worlds apart from the majorMexican cities or even, those of the USA, across the border. Themovie's action isn't entirely isolated, as the tourism hot spots arealso partly filmed, so the audience is able to see that the storytakes place in this day and age.As said, apart from the psychological aspects that some mayappreciate, (the role being that of a burnt out, aging Vietnam vet,turned CIA operative), the film also intertwines occasionally somehuman aspects as well, such as the poverty of a segment of theMexican population, and the peasant beauty of the actress, playedintelligently, and charismatically by Giovanna Zacarias.Surely, some may question the realism or even, the necessity of oncemore bringing in the sterotype of Mexican women as maids, who areeasy to buy favors from,  and of Mexican men as police officers, lawenforcement, some of which are ""clearly"" corrupt.Harvey Keitel is brought in, to add some spice from time to time, inthe movie, and rescue it from a made-for-TV only stigma, thatotherwise might discourage DVD rental customers, or buyers. Kietelonly mostestly appears in the movie, and isn't given a chance to domuch with his role, or play out  anything remotely close to thepowerful impact some of his previous movies allowed him to do.The audio, music is acceptable, if not a bit repetitive, and theclassic score too identical to what we've heard 100's of timesbefore. This is mitigated with the flamenco guitar that is alsointerspersed in the soundtrack, to emphasize the Mexican-ness ofthis movie.Overall, not a bad experience, but not something that people willwant to see a second time.",2,"Post-traumatic stress syndrome, in rural Mexico, by a Vietnam Vet and CIA operative",1173916800,"03 15, 2007",2007,2331,"['Puerto', 'Vallarta', 'Squeeze', 'dark', 'conspiracy-laden', 'movie', 'tellinga', 'story', 'somewhat', 'over-worked', 'considering', 'author', 'feltthe', 'need', 'have', 'one', 'protagonists', 'profession', 'be', 'afamed', 'book', 'writer', '.It', 'will', 'also', 'probably', 'be', 'interest', 'mostly', 'military', 'veterans', 'who', 'can', 'relate', 'post-traumatic', 'stress', 'syndrome', 'literally', '100', 'thousands', 'former', 'personnel', 'inthe', 'well', 'documented', 'conflicts', 'Vietnam', 'former', 'covertoperatives', 'CIA', 'played', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'picture.Apart', 'interesting', 'filmed', 'aspects', 'small-towns', 'acrossNorthern', 'Mexico', 'picture', 'also', 'rural', 'aspects', 'andabandoned', 'villages', 'obviously', 'are', 'worlds', 'apart', 'majorMexican', 'cities', 'even', 'USA', 'border', 'Themovie', 'action', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'isolated', 'tourism', 'hot', 'spots', 'arealso', 'partly', 'filmed', 'audience', 'able', 'see', 'storytakes', 'place', 'day', 'age.As', 'said', 'apart', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'mayappreciate', 'role', 'being', 'burnt', 'out', 'aging', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'turned', 'CIA', 'operative', 'film', 'also', 'occasionally', 'somehuman', 'aspects', 'as', 'well', 'such', 'poverty', 'segment', 'theMexican', 'population', 'peasant', 'beauty', 'actress', 'playedintelligently', 'charismatically', 'Giovanna', 'Zacarias.Surely', 'may', 'question', 'realism', 'even', 'necessity', 'oncemore', 'bringing', 'sterotype', 'Mexican', 'women', 'maids', 'who', 'areeasy', 'buy', 'favors', 'Mexican', 'men', 'police', 'officers', 'lawenforcement', 'are', 'clearly', 'corrupt.Harvey', 'Keitel', 'brought', 'add', 'spice', 'time', 'time', 'inthe', 'movie', 'rescue', 'made-for-TV', 'only', 'stigma', 'thatotherwise', 'might', 'discourage', 'DVD', 'rental', 'customers', 'buyers', 'Kietelonly', 'mostestly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'given', 'chance', 'domuch', 'role', 'play', 'out', 'anything', 'remotely', 'close', 'thepowerful', 'impact', 'previous', 'movies', 'allowed', 'do.The', 'audio', 'music', 'acceptable', 'not', 'bit', 'repetitive', 'theclassic', 'score', 'too', 'identical', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', '100', 'timesbefore', 'mitigated', 'flamenco', 'guitar', 'alsointerspersed', 'soundtrack', 'emphasize', 'Mexican-ness', 'ofthis', 'movie.Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'experience', 'not', 'something', 'people', 'willwant', 'see', 'second', 'time']",Puerto Vallarta Squeeze
