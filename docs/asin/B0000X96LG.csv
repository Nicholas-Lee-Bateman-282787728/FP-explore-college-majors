I fully believe there could have been much more to the plot, the acting, more action, more gore, more comedy... it's very lacking. I personally love stupid, campy horror movies... i love dark humor... i even love most horror films which try to give an intelligent humor... this was none of those things and not ""scary"" or ""creepy"" enough to be a horror movie beyond those things. I believe I own over 400 horror/thriller/gore/b-horror movies... this one I purchased knowing it would be a great addition. 3 of my campy horror movie night pals watched this with me... they said I couldn't give it away for free!!!! They all hated it as well. I'm going to see if it burns better than it plays...On the other hand, if you liked this... you might also like ""I.Zombie"" which was also terrible.",3,UnLucky,1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,823,"['gave', 'three', 'great', 'efforts', 'fully', 'believe', 'there', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'acting', 'more', 'action', 'more', 'gore', 'more', 'comedy', 'very', 'lacking', 'personally', 'love', 'stupid', 'campy', 'horror', 'movies', 'i', 'love', 'dark', 'humor', 'i', 'even', 'love', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'try', 'give', 'intelligent', 'humor', 'was', 'none', 'things', 'not', 'scary', 'creepy', 'enough', 'be', 'horror', 'movie', 'things', 'believe', 'own', 'over', '400', 'horror/thriller/gore/b-horror', 'movies', 'one', 'purchased', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'addition', '3', 'campy', 'horror', 'movie', 'night', 'pals', 'watched', 'said', 'could', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'free', 'hated', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'going', 'see', 'better', 'other', 'hand', 'liked', 'might', 'also', 'I.Zombie', 'was', 'also', 'terrible']",Lucky

Sharrah ""- B Movie Fan""","[3, 4]","I really did not know what to expect when I rented this bad boy, but having a sick fascination with B/amateur horror I decided to pick it up. The story was so twisted you couldn't help but laugh! But it wouldn't be nearly as enteraining if it wasn't for the dry, and quick wit of the main character and his narrations. His submissive persona and completely oblivious views of his character's slow spiral into dementia are priceless. It reminds me of a twisted version of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, except in this one Kevin kills Paul and Winnie and buries them in his backyard.",4,"Here Lucky, *whistle*",1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,580,"['really', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'rented', 'bad', 'boy', 'having', 'sick', 'fascination', 'B/amateur', 'horror', 'decided', 'pick', 'up', 'story', 'was', 'so', 'twisted', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nearly', 'enteraining', 'was', ""n't"", 'dry', 'quick', 'wit', 'main', 'character', 'narrations', 'submissive', 'persona', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'views', 'character', 'slow', 'spiral', 'dementia', 'are', 'priceless', 'twisted', 'version', 'quot', 'Wonder', 'Years', 'quot', 'one', 'Kevin', 'Paul', 'Winnie', 'buries', 'backyard']",Lucky

788737,A2M5HPYWNL433M,B0000X96LG,"JOHN NATHAN ""darkblood""","[1, 2]","Lucky is one of those movies that looks at the bare animalistic nature of things existing in the suburban wasteland, with lots of weird and complicated monologues.  They're not bad.  In fact I like monologues.  Of course these monologues were a bit disturbing, but that's okay.  This is a horror movie.  The storyline is a bit simplistic: a cartoon writer writes only junk until a talking dog inspires him to greatness, however the talking dog wants him to kill.  The movie seems to evolve slightly from this model, as the killings seem to take precedence over the dog or the writer.  The other characters, other than his girlfriend, are quite one-dimensional and play into stereotypes.  I did get the feeling that we were not only seeing the world through his eyes, but also his perception.  Maybe this is all in his head, as a waking nightmare.  Maybe it's a rationalization for his own violent sexual fetishes of sadism, torture, and necrophilia.  Oh by the way, if you're very sensitive about those kinds of things, you may want to skip this movie.  While it is simplistic at times, I still recommend the movie for its psychological bludgeoning.",3,Maybe it's all in your head,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,1149,"['Lucky', 'one', 'movies', 'bare', 'animalistic', 'nature', 'things', 'existing', 'suburban', 'wasteland', 'lots', 'weird', 'complicated', 'monologues', ""'re"", 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'monologues', 'course', 'monologues', 'were', 'bit', 'disturbing', 'okay', 'horror', 'movie', 'storyline', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'cartoon', 'writer', 'only', 'junk', 'talking', 'dog', 'greatness', 'however', 'talking', 'dog', 'kill', 'movie', 'evolve', 'slightly', 'model', 'killings', 'seem', 'take', 'precedence', 'dog', 'writer', 'other', 'characters', 'other', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'quite', 'one-dimensional', 'play', 'stereotypes', 'did', 'get', 'feeling', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'seeing', 'world', 'eyes', 'also', 'perception', 'Maybe', 'head', 'waking', 'nightmare', 'rationalization', 'own', 'violent', 'sexual', 'fetishes', 'sadism', 'torture', 'necrophilia', 'Oh', 'way', ""'re"", 'very', 'sensitive', 'kinds', 'things', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'movie', 'simplistic', 'times', 'still', 'recommend', 'movie', 'psychological', 'bludgeoning']",Lucky
788738,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0000X96LG,Michael Butts,"[0, 2]","LUCKY starts out promising.  Michael Emanuel, who also produced, stars as Millard Mudd, a cartoon writer, whose life is going to the dogs (in more ways than one).  One fateful night, he runs over a stray dog named Lucky and from that point on, his life changes.  One realizes that we're watching the fall of a man into total dementia/insanity, and that the things going on are merely in the man's mind.  Clues include the fact that the dog never really ""talks""; Mudd hears him.  The situations that happen are funny at first, but then the movie descends into really distasteful exploitation, such as Millard making love to the corpse of the delivery girl, and having fantasies about killing or torturing the love of his life.  Emanuel is fairly effective, having to carry the whole movie, and Piper Cochrane as Misty has a certain appeal.  But this turns out to be one sick movie, that is not redeemed by the fact that it's all purportedly ""psychological"" in nature.  Torturing and raping dead people isn't my idea of entertainment.",2,LUCKY GOES TO THE DOGS,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,1032,"['LUCKY', 'out', 'promising', 'Michael', 'Emanuel', 'who', 'also', 'produced', 'stars', 'Millard', 'Mudd', 'cartoon', 'writer', 'life', 'going', 'dogs', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'One', 'fateful', 'night', 'stray', 'dog', 'named', 'Lucky', 'point', 'life', 'changes', 'One', ""'re"", 'watching', 'fall', 'man', 'total', 'dementia/insanity', 'things', 'going', 'are', 'merely', 'man', 'mind', 'Clues', 'include', 'fact', 'dog', 'never', 'really', 'talks', 'Mudd', 'situations', 'happen', 'are', 'funny', 'first', 'then', 'movie', 'really', 'distasteful', 'exploitation', 'such', 'Millard', 'making', 'love', 'corpse', 'delivery', 'girl', 'having', 'fantasies', 'killing', 'torturing', 'love', 'life', 'Emanuel', 'fairly', 'effective', 'having', 'carry', 'whole', 'movie', 'Piper', 'Cochrane', 'Misty', 'certain', 'appeal', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'sick', 'movie', 'not', 'redeemed', 'fact', 'purportedly', 'psychological', 'nature', 'Torturing', 'raping', 'dead', 'people', ""n't"", 'idea', 'entertainment']",Lucky

While it was definitely a direct to video release there certainly wasn't anything masterful about it.  We get a story of a loser screen writer doing the bidding of his dog, which involves bloodshed.

788741,AK61LQI92GTCH,B0000X96LG,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[5, 8]","I've wasted way too much time agonizing over how many stars to give LUCKY.  For the first three-quarters of the movie I had it pegged as a solid five stars.  I enjoyed the demented inner life of Millard Mudd.I even bought into the premise: Schlep cartoonist runs over dog.  Dog dies and returns to life.  Dog feeds Mudd story ideas and Mudd begins to pull his life together.  The situations were creative, the writing sharp and the dialogue crisp.  I laughed out loud more than once.What I really didn't like was the last half-hour or so, when we pull away from Mudd's inner world and track, sometimes graphically, his career as a serial killer and necrophiliac.  It was like tacking HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER onto the end of HARVEY.Look, you can argue that there's humor in the scene where Mudd is tying up his imaginary girlfriend Misty and they have a cheery conversation about the terrible things he'll have to do to her and the souvenirs he may wish to keep.  Macabre, black satire isn't everybody's cup of tea, but at least Misty was a figment of Mudd's imagination.  Knowing that, and with the Stepford-wife treatment given Misty in this scene, it worked.No matter what the film makers seem to think, though, abducting, torturing, and raping young women isn't funny.  That's about all that happens in the final quarter of this movie, and it pretty much wrecks everything that preceded it.LUCKY betrays itself and defrauds the audience.  Considering its great start, this is the most disappointing movie I've seen in a long time.",2,Un-Lucky,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",2004,1544,"[""'ve"", 'wasted', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'agonizing', 'how', 'many', 'stars', 'give', 'LUCKY', 'first', 'three-quarters', 'movie', 'had', 'pegged', 'solid', 'five', 'stars', 'enjoyed', 'demented', 'inner', 'life', 'Millard', 'Mudd.I', 'even', 'bought', 'premise', 'Schlep', 'cartoonist', 'dog', 'Dog', 'dies', 'returns', 'life', 'Dog', 'Mudd', 'story', 'ideas', 'Mudd', 'pull', 'life', 'together', 'situations', 'were', 'creative', 'writing', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'crisp', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'more', 'once.What', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'last', 'half-hour', 'so', 'when', 'pull', 'away', 'Mudd', 'inner', 'world', 'track', 'sometimes', 'graphically', 'career', 'serial', 'killer', 'necrophiliac', 'was', 'tacking', 'HENRY', 'PORTRAIT', 'A', 'SERIAL', 'KILLER', 'end', 'HARVEY.Look', 'can', 'argue', 'humor', 'scene', 'where', 'Mudd', 'tying', 'up', 'imaginary', 'girlfriend', 'Misty', 'have', 'cheery', 'conversation', 'terrible', 'things', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'her', 'souvenirs', 'may', 'wish', 'keep', 'Macabre', 'black', 'satire', ""n't"", 'everybody', 'cup', 'tea', 'least', 'Misty', 'was', 'figment', 'Mudd', 'imagination', 'Knowing', 'Stepford-wife', 'treatment', 'given', 'Misty', 'scene', 'matter', 'what', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'think', 'though', 'abducting', 'torturing', 'raping', 'young', 'women', ""n't"", 'funny', 'final', 'quarter', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'wrecks', 'everything', 'preceded', 'it.LUCKY', 'betrays', 'defrauds', 'audience', 'Considering', 'great', 'start', 'most', 'disappointing', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time']",Lucky
