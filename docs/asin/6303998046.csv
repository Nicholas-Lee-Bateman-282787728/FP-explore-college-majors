Afterall, it is very similar to the 1961 Parent Trap and its 1998 remake.Yet this movie came up with the ingenius idea of actually recruiting the Olsen twins, instead of one girl only, to play the two roles. Instead of asking a child to shoot each scene twice, Mary-Kate and Ashley could really respond to each other and focus on the characters comfortably. There were unexpected twists and enough big shots for the twins to engage their talking eyes and sweet smiles, play cunning tricks on the step-mother to be and match-making. The result was a warm and alluring family movie!If flaws must be found, one definitely would be exaggerating the shortcomings of Clarice, the stepmother-to-be. No way the father of the twins would be attracted to Clarice. There was also no attempt of explaining why the two girls looked so much alike.

394821,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,6303998046,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[0, 0]","""It Takes Two"" is the friendly middle ground as far as Mary-Kate & Ashley movies are concerned: it retains their trademark ""adorable"" factor without the cloying cutesy-ness of their previous three films and exercises a family-friendly comprehensiveness that was forever lost on their later made-for-teen-girls DTV flicks. In short, this is probably the most perfect Mary-Kate & Ashley outing if there ever was such a thing, and is definitely the most tasteful of their offerings to introduce new fans to.The story: Amanda Lemmon (Mary-Kate Olsen) - a tough-talking orphan raised in New York City under the care of her case worker Diane Barrows (Kirstie Alley,Cheers) - is set to be adopted by a creepy couple exploiting child labor. Alyssa Callaway (Ashley Olsen) is the well-bred young daughter of a wealthy widower (Steve Guttenberg,Police Academy series), who's looking to marry a gold-digging witch of a woman (Jane Sibbett, ""Santa Barbara"") promising to ship her off to boarding school. When all seems out of their control, the two identical strangers meet during a summer outing and concoct a plan involving them switching identities to bring their two guardians together in hopes of having them fall in love, thereby stopping the marriage and allowing Diane to adopt Amanda.Granted, the synopsis seems like the half-baked kind of plot that you'd find in some of the twins' later movies, but if you can suspend disbelief enough to allow for their chance meeting that kicks off most of the action, the absurdity is very digestible for the fact that it's not overdone and is pulled off marvelously by the cast. Alley, Guttenberg, and Philip Bosco (My Best Friend's Wedding) as the latter's colorful butler give exceptionally warm performances and end up as likeable as the girls themselves, while Sibbett is a perfectly hiss-able children's villain who looks best when being played a trick on. On the whole, the twins do a good job (and would both be nominated by the Young Artist Awards for their performances), but I was disappointed that their initial distinctive personalities dissolve into a collective persona: Amanda starts off as a slang-spewing stickball player and Alyssa as an eloquent little prude, but halfway into the movie, you can't tell the two apart. It's kinda sloppy on the part of director Andy Tennant (Sweet Home Alabama, but thankfully this is not a fatal goof.The film is obviously aimed at children between six and twelve, but lacks the asininity to inspire grown-up headaches even if a parent doesn't really like the movie. It's mushy and a bit sing-songy in some parts, but makes up for it in handy humor - both physical and situational - and definite heart, allowing me to deem ""It Takes Two"" the most intelligent, competent, and integrating film that the Olsen twins have ever been a part of. Fans will already have it, but should parent or little girl be faced with the choice of this and, say,Billboard DadorPassport To Paris, there ought to be no question about which to choose.",4,"It Takes Two, But It Gets The Job Done Fine",1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,3015,"['Two', 'friendly', 'middle', 'ground', 'as', 'far', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'movies', 'are', 'concerned', 'trademark', 'adorable', 'factor', 'cloying', 'cutesy-ness', 'previous', 'three', 'films', 'family-friendly', 'comprehensiveness', 'was', 'forever', 'lost', 'later', 'made-for-teen-girls', 'DTV', 'flicks', 'short', 'probably', 'most', 'perfect', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'outing', 'ever', 'was', 'such', 'thing', 'definitely', 'most', 'tasteful', 'offerings', 'introduce', 'new', 'fans', 'to.The', 'story', 'Amanda', 'Lemmon', 'Mary-Kate', 'Olsen', 'tough-talking', 'orphan', 'raised', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'care', 'case', 'worker', 'Diane', 'Barrows', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Cheers', 'set', 'be', 'adopted', 'creepy', 'couple', 'exploiting', 'child', 'labor', 'Alyssa', 'Callaway', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'well-bred', 'young', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'widower', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'Police', 'Academy', 'series', 'who', 'looking', 'marry', 'gold-digging', 'witch', 'woman', 'Jane', 'Sibbett', 'Santa', 'Barbara', 'promising', 'ship', 'off', 'boarding', 'school', 'When', 'control', 'two', 'identical', 'strangers', 'meet', 'summer', 'outing', 'concoct', 'plan', 'involving', 'switching', 'identities', 'bring', 'two', 'guardians', 'together', 'hopes', 'having', 'fall', 'love', 'thereby', 'stopping', 'marriage', 'allowing', 'Diane', 'adopt', 'Amanda.Granted', 'synopsis', 'half-baked', 'kind', 'plot', ""'d"", 'find', 'twins', 'later', 'movies', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enough', 'allow', 'chance', 'meeting', 'most', 'action', 'absurdity', 'very', 'digestible', 'fact', 'not', 'overdone', 'pulled', 'off', 'marvelously', 'cast', 'Alley', 'Guttenberg', 'Philip', 'Bosco', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'latter', 'colorful', 'butler', 'give', 'exceptionally', 'warm', 'performances', 'end', 'up', 'as', 'likeable', 'girls', 'Sibbett', 'perfectly', 'hiss-able', 'children', 'villain', 'who', 'best', 'when', 'being', 'played', 'trick', 'whole', 'twins', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'would', 'be', 'nominated', 'Young', 'Artist', 'Awards', 'performances', 'was', 'disappointed', 'initial', 'distinctive', 'personalities', 'dissolve', 'collective', 'persona', 'Amanda', 'off', 'slang-spewing', 'stickball', 'player', 'Alyssa', 'eloquent', 'little', 'prude', 'halfway', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'two', 'apart', 'kinda', 'sloppy', 'part', 'director', 'Andy', 'Tennant', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'thankfully', 'not', 'fatal', 'goof.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'aimed', 'children', 'six', 'twelve', 'asininity', 'inspire', 'grown-up', 'headaches', 'even', 'parent', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'mushy', 'bit', 'sing-songy', 'parts', 'up', 'handy', 'humor', 'physical', 'situational', 'definite', 'heart', 'allowing', 'deem', 'Two', 'most', 'intelligent', 'competent', 'integrating', 'film', 'Olsen', 'twins', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'part', 'Fans', 'will', 'already', 'have', 'should', 'parent', 'little', 'girl', 'be', 'faced', 'choice', 'say', 'Billboard', 'DadorPassport', 'Paris', 'ought', 'be', 'question', 'choose']",It Takes Two VHS

I grew up on Full House and have always loved watching those two.  They've done a lot of movies, and this one is my favorite.  Supported by the charming Steve Guttenberg, the extremely funny Kirstie Alley, and a supporting cast that includes Philip Bosco as the sly and smart butler and Jane Sibbett as Clarice, the snooty, evil-plotting fiance of Guttenberg's character, this movie is sure to please any fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley.  So the story goes kind of like this: look-alikes Amanda and Alyssa (Mary-Kate and Ashley, respectively) literally bump into each other while at a summer camp (that Amanda's a camper at and that Alyssa's extremely rich father happens to own).  Once the two realize how closely they resemble each other, they hatch a plan to get Alyssa's single dad and Amanda's pretty caseworker romantically involved.  Will they succeed, amidst foodfights, canoes falling over, and the interference of the conniving Clarice?  This is a fun movie from beginning to end, with lots of visual treats (Andy Tennant Films--Fools Rush In, Ever After, etc.--always seem to have beautiful scenery), funny dialogue, and fantastic characters.  There's exactly one slightly objectionable word (spoken by one of the Olsens), but I think only very conservative parents will have a problem with it.

394824,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,6303998046,MollyRK,"[1, 1]","Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's first theatrical release was released in the same year that their breakout television series ""Full House"" wrapped up its 8-year-run, and this film was just one of thousands of efforts to help the girls maintain a Hollywood career beyond ""Full House."" Those countless mystery/party videos, music recordings, books-on-tape and straight-to-video movies became a phenomenal marketing franchise. That all led to a few more short-lived TV series and very successful clothing/merchandise line, among many other things, and now that Mary-Kate and Ashley are almost 21 years old they are far and away two of the biggest, most successful child actresses America is likely to see.Before the Olsens began promoting fashion and sticking their names on virtually everything they could get their hands on, they were children. They were young child actresses who played ""Michelle Tanner"" on TV and used that cuteness as a vehicle toward the several movies and home videos that were created for them. ""It Takes Two"" is a wonderful film for long-time followers of the Olsen franchise to revisit and enjoy. At 8 years old, the girls really were very sweet and fun to watch on screen. This movie gave them a chance to work with some bigger name actors, and there's no doubt they worked very nicely alongside Kirstie Alley and Steve Guttenberg.Many have dubbed ""It Takes Two"" as a cross between ""The Prince and the Pauper"" and ""The Parent Trap,"" and that's basically what the film is. Orphaned tomboy Amanda (Mary-Kate) and a wealthy ""Daddy's little princess"" Alyssa (Ashley), two identical strangers, literally run into each other and scheme to unite Amanda's attractive social worker (Kirstie Alley) and Alyssa's lonely widowed father (Steve Guttenberg), all while struggling to get rid of Dad's monster of a fiance. The plot gave the girls some simple, consistent material to work with, and few can deny that they were very endearing at this age. They may be a different Mary-Kate and Ashley than they were in the early/mid 1990's, but we will always have things like this to remember those young, charismatic little faces that first captured the hearts of America.",5,"very entertaining, and the best of the Olsen twins",1146009600,"04 26, 2006",2006,2176,"['Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'Olsen', 'first', 'theatrical', 'release', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'breakout', 'television', 'series', 'Full', 'House', 'wrapped', 'up', '8-year-run', 'film', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'thousands', 'efforts', 'help', 'girls', 'maintain', 'Hollywood', 'career', 'Full', 'House', 'countless', 'mystery/party', 'videos', 'music', 'recordings', 'books-on-tape', 'straight-to-video', 'movies', 'became', 'phenomenal', 'marketing', 'franchise', 'led', 'few', 'more', 'short-lived', 'TV', 'series', 'very', 'successful', 'clothing/merchandise', 'line', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'now', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'are', 'almost', '21', 'years', 'old', 'are', 'far', 'away', 'two', 'biggest', 'most', 'successful', 'child', 'actresses', 'America', 'likely', 'see.Before', 'Olsens', 'began', 'promoting', 'fashion', 'sticking', 'names', 'virtually', 'everything', 'could', 'get', 'hands', 'were', 'children', 'were', 'young', 'child', 'actresses', 'who', 'played', 'Michelle', 'Tanner', 'TV', 'used', 'cuteness', 'vehicle', 'several', 'movies', 'home', 'videos', 'were', 'created', 'Two', 'wonderful', 'film', 'long-time', 'followers', 'Olsen', 'franchise', 'revisit', 'enjoy', '8', 'years', 'old', 'girls', 'really', 'were', 'very', 'sweet', 'fun', 'watch', 'screen', 'movie', 'gave', 'chance', 'work', 'bigger', 'name', 'actors', 'doubt', 'worked', 'very', 'nicely', 'alongside', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg.Many', 'have', 'dubbed', 'Two', 'cross', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'basically', 'what', 'film', 'Orphaned', 'tomboy', 'Amanda', 'Mary-Kate', 'wealthy', 'Daddy', 'little', 'princess', 'Alyssa', 'Ashley', 'two', 'identical', 'strangers', 'literally', 'run', 'other', 'scheme', 'unite', 'Amanda', 'attractive', 'social', 'worker', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'Alyssa', 'lonely', 'widowed', 'father', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'struggling', 'get', 'rid', 'Dad', 'monster', 'fiance', 'plot', 'gave', 'girls', 'simple', 'consistent', 'material', 'work', 'few', 'can', 'deny', 'were', 'very', 'endearing', 'age', 'may', 'be', 'different', 'Mary-Kate', 'Ashley', 'were', 'early/mid', '1990', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'things', 'remember', 'young', 'charismatic', 'little', 'first', 'captured', 'hearts', 'America']",It Takes Two VHS
