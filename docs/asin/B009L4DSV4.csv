Stewart and Dee are an absolute joy.However, this is my beef: the film, though not in Pan/Scan as in the case of this company's other recent CinemaScope releases,is presented in the ""Letterboxed"" format and it is NOT Anamorphic by any means. It will come as a big dissappointment to those of you who own a Flat Screen and play movies in their original format. If you still have one of the old CRT TV sets of yesteryear, or you don't care, you'll be Okay.As for me, I am totally baffled that in 2012 a major studio, whose wide screen system in 1953 revolutionized the way films are presented forever, would release their old CinemaScope movies  in a tiny Letterboxed format, when their older CinemaScope DVD releases, like the Monroe fliks, ""Peyton Place,"" ""The Man In The Grey Flannel Suit,"" etc. were originally released completely anamorphic in order to fit on rear projection screens of a few years ago!

The film, an adaptation of Phoebe and Henry Ephron's hit stage play, focuses on the misadventures of Frank Michaelson (Stewart) as he travels across country and continent to protect his daughter's (Dee) virtue.  Co-starring Audrey Meadows, John McGiver, and Robert Morley, Take Her, She's Mine looks breathtaking in widescreen (one of the few CinemaScope features in this collection that retains its original aspect ratio) and offers a crisp monotrack.  No special features, but the delightful film (and its pristine print) warrants the purchase price.
