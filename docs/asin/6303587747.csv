Maybe one 16 year old  out of athousand could possibly hold those notes but onlyfor so long.The only slightly believable one is actually the African American boyand only because of his stature even though at the time of the filming he was also 16.At least Disney's  ""Almost Angels"" was  properly castwith actual choir boys, (The Vienna Choir Boys) and theportrayed boy who joined the choir was of proper age.Even the plot made a point of showing a boy going throughthe change desperately trying to hide what was occurringand heartbroken over the loss of his beautiful sopranovoice.That was a much more believable scenario in allregards than this load of claptrap.Insofar as the racial aspects of this film theywere as believable as any other p/c film thatattempts to pander to the typical white breadDisney viewer but even for the 90's this was pushingthe boundaries of hokiness especially the portrayedfriendship between the lead white boy and the black.Think it would have been more believable hadJustin actually been about 14;  he had the empathydown pat but he just played too old for the part.The worst tragedy of this farce is that Disneynever gave credit to the real choir that performedall the vocals and worst, the true 'soloist' that actuallysang Whalen's lip synced parodies of a solo sopranowas not mentioned either!I've run the net back and forth trying to find out whichchoir performed all the choral pieces but can't find a thing.I suspect Disney's thumb is all over that and I'm surprisedthat after all this time no one has let the cat out of the bag.Anyone that truly enjoys the sound of boy choirs andthe remarkable skill that goes into their performancesshould be aghast at this travesty of this  film and thebounds of credibility it stretches past the pointof breaking.The  fact that they put out this garbage in1991 is even sadder, maybe I would have made allowancesfor a touch more had it been made in the 60's  but I thinkeven then tripe was still tripe and this be TRIPE!!",2,Lets get real People!,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,2482,"['Thank', 'God', 'saw', 'Netflix', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', '~Lord', 'movie', 'height', 'miscasting', 'what', 'one', 'boy', 'male', 'less', '16', 'most', '17', 'time', 'filming', 'had', 'alreadyreached', 'puberty', 'soprano', 'voices.Watching', '17', 'year', 'old', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'lip', 'syncing', 'truesolo', 'soprano', 'wan', 'na', 'be', ""'lead"", 'boy', 'total', 'joke', 'andeven', 'worse', ""'d"", 'have', 'believe', ""his'adolescent"", 'roommates', 'were', 'also', 'capable', 'suchhigh', 'registers', 'Maybe', 'one', '16', 'year', 'old', 'athousand', 'could', 'possibly', 'hold', 'notes', 'onlyfor', 'so', 'long.The', 'only', 'slightly', 'believable', 'one', 'actually', 'African', 'American', 'boyand', 'only', 'stature', 'even', 'time', 'filming', 'was', 'also', '16.At', 'least', 'Disney', 'Almost', 'Angels', 'was', 'properly', 'castwith', 'actual', 'choir', 'boys', 'Vienna', 'Choir', 'Boys', 'theportrayed', 'boy', 'who', 'joined', 'choir', 'was', 'proper', 'plot', 'made', 'point', 'showing', 'boy', 'going', 'throughthe', 'change', 'desperately', 'trying', 'hide', 'what', 'was', 'occurringand', 'heartbroken', 'over', 'loss', 'beautiful', 'sopranovoice.That', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'scenario', 'allregards', 'load', 'claptrap.Insofar', 'racial', 'aspects', 'film', 'theywere', 'as', 'believable', 'other', 'p/c', 'film', 'thatattempts', 'pander', 'typical', 'white', 'breadDisney', 'viewer', 'even', '90', 'was', 'pushingthe', 'boundaries', 'hokiness', 'especially', 'portrayedfriendship', 'lead', 'white', 'boy', 'black.Think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'believable', 'hadJustin', 'actually', 'been', '14', 'had', 'empathydown', 'pat', 'just', 'played', 'too', 'old', 'part.The', 'worst', 'tragedy', 'farce', 'Disneynever', 'gave', 'credit', 'real', 'choir', 'vocals', 'worst', 'true', ""'soloist"", 'Whalen', 'lip', 'synced', 'parodies', 'solo', 'sopranowas', 'not', 'mentioned', ""'ve"", 'run', 'net', 'back', 'forth', 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'whichchoir', 'performed', 'choral', 'pieces', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'thing.I', 'suspect', 'Disney', 'thumb', ""'m"", 'surprisedthat', 'time', 'one', 'let', 'cat', 'bag.Anyone', 'truly', 'sound', 'boy', 'choirs', 'andthe', 'remarkable', 'skill', 'performancesshould', 'be', 'aghast', 'travesty', 'film', 'thebounds', 'credibility', 'pointof', 'breaking.The', 'fact', 'put', 'out', 'garbage', 'in1991', 'even', 'sadder', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'allowancesfor', 'touch', 'more', 'had', 'been', 'made', '60', 'thinkeven', 'then', 'tripe', 'was', 'still', 'tripe', 'be', 'TRIPE']",N/A

One of her teachers borrowed it and ruined it.  I am so excited to have it once again.  I love the music and especially how they have incorporated spiritual music into the mix.  My daughter sang with her award winning, number one in the state school choral group and they sang some of these very songs.  They are allowed to do Christian music because it is part of the arts.  Sad, isn't it?This movie exemplified how easy it is to get along with others who are different if we will just make the effort.
