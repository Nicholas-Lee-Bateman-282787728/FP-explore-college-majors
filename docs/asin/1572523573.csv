This is one of those movies and the reaction I get from it is negative: I want to shake these characters by the shoulders to get them to stop what they're doing.Set in Lyon, France, during the 1950s, two women become very close friends (lovers actually) and want to escape from the confines of their marriages and their husbands. One is married to a selfish schemer who deals on the blackmarket; the other to a garage owner who loves nothing more than playing with his kids. The two womwn feel ""trapped"" and ""confined"" by these men, and long to be ""free.""If director Kurys wants the viewer to feel sympathetic toward these two ""modern"" women, she's failed miserably with me: they come across as little more than selfish flakes. The men have their problems, too (insensitive, doting), but they at least appear more honest. I know feminism meant different things in different parts of the world, and this movie deals with French concerns (which are different than American or Arabic or Chinese), but it's really difficult to swallow. As a piece of movie making it is very well done - and certainly evokes very strong reactions. I wonder what the validity quotient of this movie is today, even in France.",4,Feminism in France in the Fifties,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,1380,"['best', 'movies', 'best', 'novels', 'are', 'present', 'characters', 'such', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'getting', 'involved', 'lives', 'having', 'strong', 'reaction', 'one', 'movies', 'reaction', 'get', 'negative', 'want', 'shake', 'characters', 'shoulders', 'get', 'stop', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing.Set', 'Lyon', 'France', '1950s', 'two', 'women', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'friends', 'lovers', 'actually', 'want', 'escape', 'confines', 'marriages', 'husbands', 'One', 'married', 'selfish', 'schemer', 'who', 'blackmarket', 'other', 'garage', 'owner', 'who', 'nothing', 'more', 'playing', 'kids', 'two', 'womwn', 'feel', 'trapped', 'confined', 'men', 'long', 'be', 'free', 'director', 'Kurys', 'viewer', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'two', 'modern', 'women', 'failed', 'miserably', 'come', 'little', 'more', 'selfish', 'flakes', 'men', 'have', 'problems', 'too', 'insensitive', 'doting', 'least', 'appear', 'more', 'honest', 'know', 'feminism', 'meant', 'different', 'things', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'movie', 'French', 'concerns', 'are', 'different', 'American', 'Arabic', 'Chinese', 'really', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'piece', 'movie', 'making', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'certainly', 'very', 'strong', 'reactions', 'wonder', 'what', 'validity', 'quotient', 'movie', 'today', 'even', 'France']",Entre Nous English subtitles  VHS
187278,AYH7LPJ6VP9T1,1572523573,C. Court,"[9, 11]","This is a beautifully made movie. What fantastic performances from Isabelle Huppert, Miou-Miou and Guy Marchand. No wonder Huppert is considered a diva. She is a great actress. When she laughs, you laugh. When she is sad, you are sad and when she is angry, you are angry. This movie is an example why the French consider movie making an art and a national tradition. This is a poignant and moving story of the strength of friendship and of jealousy. Think of spending Saturday with your girlfriend shopping and coming home to a jealous boyfriend or husband, or being upset with your boyfriend or husband because he spends endless hours discussing politics or NASCAR with his friend. This movie goes deeper but you will understand the meaning of friendship and why friends gather from and give strength to each other and of the irritating emotion of jealousy. This movie is eloquently written and superbly acted. While viewing this movie it would not be unusual to feel ambivalent emotions. The movie constantly elicits joy, seriousness, laughter, and sadness. If you do not speak French the subtitles may be disruptive. You may find yourself ocassionally reviewing the scenes to read the subtitles. But I could not take my eyes away from the screen. It is a pleasure to look at Huppert and Miou-Miou, they are beatiful and so are the clothes! This was the first French movie I have seen in a long time. Since then I have purchased other French movies. Why do French movies always make you think for a long time after you have seen it?

187279,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,1572523573,Dennis Littrell,"[25, 27]","Michel (Guy Marchand) falls in love with Jewish refuge Lena (Isabelle Huppert) at first sight and offers marriage as a way she can avoid being sent to a German concentration camp.  She accepts, and although she doesn't love him, they have two children and are still married when we pick up the action again in Lyons in 1952 when Lena is 29-years-old.  There she meets the sophisticated and well-to-do artist Madeleine (Miou-Miou) who awakens her to the drabness of her existence as a housewife with a loutish husband who now runs a gas station.  The attraction between Lena and Madeleine is very strong, and very threatening to the men, especially to Michel.Huppert's poignant and bittersweet portrayal reminds me of her delicate work in Madame Bovary (1991).  There is the same listlessness expressed along with a vague desire for something better out of life, and the anticipation of the sadness that we know will come of such desire.  Miou-Miou is sharp and cynical with perhaps a streak of the manic-depressive about her.  The love they spontaneously feel for one another is real and beautiful and makes us want it to be fulfilled.  But Lena holds herself back because of her family, and then it is the men and propriety that get in the way.Of course this is very French and Lena and Madeleine hold hands and comfort one another while telling each other their innermost secrets including the infidelities of their spouses, etc.  (The men have no such communication.)  Director Diane Kurys exercises more restraint in showing the physical nature of their mutual attraction than would be displayed today.  Lena says to Madeleine at one point, ""I want to kiss you,"" but we do not see them kissing.  The most explicit scene sexually is the startling, but delicately expressed, meeting with the soldiers on the train where we discover the full extent of Lena's frustration.This is not quite a great movie.  The pace is a little slow in spots and sometimes the focus is not as sharp as it could be.  But it is an extraordinarily honest movie, and I'll take that over sharp technique any day.  Huppert is not only at her best here, but her exquisite and subtle beauty is shown to great advantage.  Miou-Miou is also very pretty of course--this is the first time I've seen her--so I would say her strength of character is perhaps her strongest suit.  This is a human tragedy on a small, intimate scale, one that we can't help but feel could have been averted had those involved understood one another better, had they been a little wiser.  We've all been there before and so we can share the sadness and the sense of loss.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""",4,"Honest, sad, beautiful and very touching",987897600,"04 22, 2001",2001,2716,"['Michel', 'Guy', 'Marchand', 'love', 'Jewish', 'refuge', 'Lena', 'Isabelle', 'Huppert', 'first', 'sight', 'marriage', 'way', 'can', 'avoid', 'being', 'sent', 'German', 'concentration', 'camp', ""n't"", 'love', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'still', 'married', 'when', 'pick', 'up', 'action', 'again', 'Lyons', '1952', 'when', 'Lena', '29-years-old', 'sophisticated', 'well-to-do', 'artist', 'Madeleine', 'Miou-Miou', 'who', 'drabness', 'existence', 'housewife', 'loutish', 'husband', 'who', 'now', 'gas', 'station', 'attraction', 'Lena', 'Madeleine', 'very', 'strong', 'very', 'threatening', 'men', 'especially', 'Michel.Huppert', 'poignant', 'bittersweet', 'portrayal', 'delicate', 'work', 'Madame', 'Bovary', '1991', 'same', 'listlessness', 'expressed', 'along', 'vague', 'desire', 'something', 'better', 'life', 'anticipation', 'sadness', 'know', 'will', 'come', 'such', 'desire', 'Miou-Miou', 'sharp', 'cynical', 'perhaps', 'streak', 'manic-depressive', 'love', 'spontaneously', 'feel', 'one', 'real', 'beautiful', 'want', 'be', 'fulfilled', 'Lena', 'back', 'family', 'then', 'men', 'propriety', 'get', 'way.Of', 'course', 'very', 'French', 'Lena', 'Madeleine', 'hold', 'hands', 'comfort', 'one', 'telling', 'other', 'innermost', 'secrets', 'including', 'infidelities', 'spouses', 'etc', 'men', 'have', 'such', 'communication', 'Director', 'Diane', 'Kurys', 'more', 'restraint', 'showing', 'physical', 'nature', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'would', 'be', 'displayed', 'today', 'Lena', 'Madeleine', 'one', 'point', 'want', 'kiss', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'kissing', 'most', 'explicit', 'scene', 'sexually', 'startling', 'delicately', 'expressed', 'meeting', 'soldiers', 'train', 'where', 'discover', 'full', 'extent', 'Lena', 'frustration.This', 'not', 'quite', 'great', 'movie', 'pace', 'little', 'slow', 'spots', 'focus', 'not', 'as', 'sharp', 'could', 'be', 'extraordinarily', 'honest', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'take', 'sharp', 'technique', 'day', 'Huppert', 'not', 'only', 'best', 'here', 'exquisite', 'subtle', 'beauty', 'shown', 'great', 'advantage', 'Miou-Miou', 'also', 'very', 'pretty', 'course', 'first', 'time', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'would', 'say', 'strength', 'character', 'perhaps', 'strongest', 'suit', 'human', 'tragedy', 'small', 'intimate', 'scale', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'averted', 'had', 'involved', 'understood', 'one', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'wiser', ""'ve"", 'been', 'before', 'so', 'can', 'share', 'sadness', 'sense', 'loss.', 'Dennis', 'Littrell', 'author', 'Cut', 'Chaise', 'Lounge', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Believe', 'Swallowed', 'Remote']",Entre Nous English subtitles  VHS

187283,AJRFZ0VZ0LD26,1572523573,"Reader ""Eugenia""","[1, 2]","We learn about two women Helene and Madeleine.  We meet Helene in WWII France in the Jewish women camp about to be send off to the concentration camp.  Her beauty meets the eye of a man who offers her marriage that she accepts as a means of avoiding the concentration camp.  At the same time, Madeleine is an art student married to a colleague student who tragically gets killed during one of the student riots.  10 years later, in the early 1950s both women get to know each other after attending their children's school rehearsal.  By now, Helene has two daughters and Madeleine has a son.  Both are trapped in the marriages that can only be described as loveless arrangements of convenience.  Their respective husbands see them as a possesions to have and show off to the outside world, creatures destined to stay home and tend to their children.  But as the friendship between the two women develops, their frustration with their lives starts to simmer.  They try to cover their dissatisfaction with love affirs, or one time encounters with the strangers, until they both come to realize how strong their mutual attraction for each other is.  Both women understand each other and feel each other's emotional void they experience with their husbands.  Their innate sense of style, strong desire for independence and want for meaningful existance draws them together to the frustration of both of their husbands. While movie never shows sexually explicit connection between two women their need for each other is obvious.  Nothing seems to be able to stop it and social norms of the time are to be broken regardless of the consequences.  Based on the life and experiences of director's mother this is a powerful story.  It is also impossible to believe that Isabelle Huppert made this film 20 almost years ago.
