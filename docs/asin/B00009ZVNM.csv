760361,A3GKPMHV4U64IY,B00009ZVNM,Joshua Koppel,"[15, 17]","This plays like an alternate version of Signs.  A young man inherits a small farm when his cousin dies in an accident.  Ha and a group of friends visit the farm in hopes of fixing it up and selling it.  But what is going on in the cornfields?Crop circles appear in the corn and noises are heard.  Someone sees a figure.  Then someone disappears.  At this point things start to really get creepy.  The dead cousin seems to have thought there were aliens in the corn and even claimed, on video, to have captured one.  Could aliens be involved?  Could they be something else?While the exact nature and origin of the creatures is not definite at the end of the film, there is an adequate explanation.  Like Signs there is a high level of creep factor in this movie with many things seeming to be just out of sight.  There are some nice twists in the plot, and the ending, that help make the film feel original and fresh.The only problems I had with the film was minor.  The farm seemed to be just a house and some cornfields.  There were no sheds, barns, silos or other buildings and a lack of farm equipment.  This is explained in the extras as the house was built in the field just for the movie.  But it is just a minor thing and not really a problem.  The other was pounding a for sale sign in right in front of the house where it can not be seen from the road 1/4 mile away.If you like creepy horror movies with heavy atmosphere or really liked Signs, you will probably like this one.",4,Creepy Cornfields,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1485,"['alternate', 'version', 'Signs', 'A', 'young', 'man', 'small', 'farm', 'when', 'cousin', 'dies', 'accident', 'Ha', 'group', 'friends', 'visit', 'farm', 'hopes', 'fixing', 'selling', 'what', 'going', 'cornfields', 'Crop', 'circles', 'appear', 'corn', 'noises', 'are', 'heard', 'Someone', 'figure', 'Then', 'someone', 'point', 'things', 'start', 'really', 'get', 'creepy', 'dead', 'cousin', 'have', 'thought', 'were', 'aliens', 'corn', 'even', 'claimed', 'video', 'have', 'captured', 'one', 'Could', 'aliens', 'be', 'involved', 'Could', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'exact', 'nature', 'origin', 'creatures', 'not', 'definite', 'end', 'film', 'adequate', 'explanation', 'Signs', 'high', 'level', 'creep', 'factor', 'movie', 'many', 'things', 'seeming', 'be', 'just', 'sight', 'are', 'nice', 'twists', 'plot', 'ending', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'feel', 'original', 'fresh.The', 'only', 'problems', 'had', 'film', 'was', 'minor', 'farm', 'seemed', 'be', 'just', 'house', 'cornfields', 'were', 'sheds', 'barns', 'silos', 'other', 'buildings', 'lack', 'farm', 'equipment', 'explained', 'extras', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'field', 'just', 'movie', 'just', 'minor', 'thing', 'not', 'really', 'problem', 'other', 'was', 'pounding', 'sale', 'sign', 'right', 'front', 'house', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'road', '1/4', 'mile', 'away.If', 'creepy', 'movies', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'liked', 'Signs', 'will', 'probably', 'one']",N/A

At least SILENT WARNINGS remains coherent, and its cast of relative unknowns do pretty good.  Name stars Stephen Baldwin and Billy Zane have little screen time; Baldwin as usual makes the best of it, and Zane as usual stinks.  I don't know how he's had a career.Anyway, the special effects are fine for a low budget movie; the director, Christian McIntire, manages to create an eerie and suspenseful mood, with some genuinely scary moments.Overall, a fairly entertaining and diverting spooker.",3,SIGNS OF THE TIMES,1091404800,"08 2, 2004",2004,572,"['have', 'admit', 'enjoyed', 'much', 'more', 'bigger-budgeted', 'SIGNS', 'least', 'SILENT', 'WARNINGS', 'coherent', 'cast', 'relative', 'unknowns', 'do', 'pretty', 'good', 'Name', 'Stephen', 'Baldwin', 'Billy', 'Zane', 'have', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'Baldwin', 'usual', 'best', 'Zane', 'usual', 'stinks', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'had', 'career.Anyway', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'fine', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'director', 'Christian', 'McIntire', 'create', 'eerie', 'suspenseful', 'mood', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'moments.Overall', 'fairly', 'entertaining', 'diverting', 'spooker']",N/A

I purchsed the movie a couple days ago and watched it last night.. and all I can say is ROFL!This show was REALLY bad and I love all kinds of weird creepy alien movies. The first time I seen the aliens I about fell out of my bed laughing. I can't believe how stupid they were. The movie doesn't flow really well its one scene after another with black scence in between (feels like its going to commercial).I'm glad to have the movie so that its part of my collection of werid alien movies, but probably not something I well really ever watch again. Its way too boring, and just doesn't feel like other alien movies.Lots of people keep comparing this movie to Signs, and that's not really fair because Signs was nothing like this movie, and it was a million times better!",2,I ROFL'd,1311984000,"07 30, 2011",2011,850,"['seen', 'movie', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'remember', 'liked', 'purchsed', 'movie', 'couple', 'days', 'ago', 'watched', 'last', 'night..', 'can', 'say', 'ROFL', 'show', 'was', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'love', 'kinds', 'weird', 'creepy', 'alien', 'movies', 'first', 'time', 'seen', 'aliens', 'about', 'fell', 'bed', 'laughing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'stupid', 'were', 'movie', ""n't"", 'flow', 'really', 'well', 'one', 'scene', 'black', 'scence', 'feels', 'going', 'commercial', '.I', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'movie', 'so', 'part', 'collection', 'werid', 'alien', 'movies', 'probably', 'not', 'something', 'well', 'really', 'ever', 'watch', 'again', 'way', 'too', 'boring', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'other', 'alien', 'movies.Lots', 'people', 'keep', 'comparing', 'movie', 'Signs', 'not', 'really', 'fair', 'Signs', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'was', 'million', 'times', 'better']",N/A
