Poor Joe - he has to go through the whole movie with Cage's bad hairstyle3. Joe has rules that make him the best in the hit man business4. People depend on Joe to do his job, get paid, and disappear.5. We often wish that 4. above would apply to Cage also6. Joe heads to Bangkok for a four-hitter for a man named Surat.7. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble as he decides to break his own rules8. Some rules aren't meant to be broken9. Best ending for Cage in recent times.This movie is about a hit man with an extremely high achievement rating. He owes his success to his personal set of rules, which don't allow for friends, relationships, loose ends or sticking around in the business for too long.For some inexplicable reason, Joe decides to deviate from the rules while on duty in Bangkok, and finds himself in all sorts of trouble.Cage does a pretty good job as the heroin-using, dour hit man, once you can get past what appears to be a dead animal splayed out on his head and down his neck. The real star however is the scene stealing Shahkrit Yamnarm as his disposable sidekick Kong.Action wise the movie is okay, except for the scenes shot in blue and red lighting where you can't really see what's going on. The romantic parts are sweet at first, but the sight of Cage doing goo-goo eyes may be upsetting to some viewers. The plot requires as little thought as possible, as it doesn't really make much sense.Recommended for fans of action-crime movies, and people with a morbid fascination for Cage's hairstyles.Rated: 3.5 starsAmanda Richards",4,Bangkok humbles a hit man,1228435200,"12 5, 2008",2008,1641,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'hit', 'man', 'named', 'Joe2', 'Poor', 'Joe', 'go', 'whole', 'movie', 'Cage', 'bad', 'hairstyle3', 'Joe', 'rules', 'make', 'best', 'hit', 'man', 'business4', 'People', 'depend', 'Joe', 'do', 'job', 'get', 'paid', 'disappear.5', 'often', 'wish', '4.', 'above', 'would', 'apply', 'Cage', 'also6', 'Joe', 'heads', 'Bangkok', 'four-hitter', 'man', 'named', 'Surat.7', 'One', 'night', 'Bangkok', 'hard', 'man', 'humble', 'break', 'own', 'rules8', 'rules', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'broken9', 'Best', 'ending', 'Cage', 'recent', 'times.This', 'movie', 'hit', 'man', 'extremely', 'high', 'achievement', 'rating', 'success', 'personal', 'set', 'rules', 'do', ""n't"", 'allow', 'friends', 'relationships', 'loose', 'ends', 'sticking', 'around', 'business', 'too', 'long.For', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'Joe', 'deviate', 'rules', 'duty', 'Bangkok', 'sorts', 'trouble.Cage', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'heroin-using', 'dour', 'hit', 'man', 'once', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'be', 'dead', 'animal', 'splayed', 'out', 'head', 'neck', 'real', 'star', 'however', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Shahkrit', 'Yamnarm', 'disposable', 'sidekick', 'Kong.Action', 'wise', 'movie', 'okay', 'scenes', 'shot', 'blue', 'red', 'lighting', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'romantic', 'parts', 'are', 'sweet', 'first', 'sight', 'Cage', 'doing', 'goo-goo', 'eyes', 'may', 'be', 'upsetting', 'viewers', 'plot', 'little', 'thought', 'possible', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'much', 'sense.Recommended', 'fans', 'action-crime', 'movies', 'people', 'morbid', 'fascination', 'Cage', 'hairstyles.Rated', '3.5', 'starsAmanda', 'Richards']",N/A

And he seemed to have been on a roll since finding National Treasure.  Next was the standout surprise of the year for me and Knowing was very entertaining, despite the apparent exploitive indifferene of its director.  The same is true of Cage's performance in Bangkok Dangerous; like all great actors, he makes the movie better than it would have been without him.  And as such, it's really not a bad film; it just has a really cheap, poorly thought-out finale.  I enjoyed the film up to the climax.  But, the resolution, aside from being senseless and unimaginitive, left such a bad taste in my mouth that it virtually ruined all the fun I had up to that point.I've kept the BD around all these months since, intent on giving the movie another chance in the hope that being better prepared will make me more foregiving.

1205423,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001J710XY,Chris Pandolfi,"[0, 0]","The ads notwithstanding, the Pang Brothers' ""Bangkok Dangerous"" is not an action movie. There are moments of action, but even then, they're mostly reserved for the final twenty minutes. They're also nowhere near as overplayed and implausible as they are in the average summer blockbuster. It would have been more accurate to market this film as a crime drama and a character study, seeing as it tells the story of an assassin who, after years of killing without hesitation, finally questions himself. When sent to Thailand for four contract killings, he looks at his life from a different perspective, one that paints a much less flattering picture of his line of work. While not the most compelling of stories, and while the human drama is at times superficial, ""Bangkok Dangerous"" still managed to hold my interest all throughout. It probably had a lot to do with not being a mindless stunt montage, opting instead for an actual plot and characters you can invest in, if only to the smallest degree.A lethal hitman named Joe (Nicholas Cage) tells us via a voiceover narration that he lives by four cardinal rules: (1) don't ask any questions; (2) don't show an interest in anyone; (3) don't leave any trace when the job is done; (4) know when it's time to get out. Within the course of ""Bangkok Dangerous,"" Joe will break the first three and put a much different spin on the fourth. He does this because, on his latest assignment in Bangkok, he meets two people who ultimately force him to reconsider the life he has led. One is a local pickpocket named Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm), who Joe hires because he speaks a little English and looks desperate enough to run errands for money. He also hires him fully intending to kill him after the job is done. Not killing him would violate the third rule of assassin conduct. But as the film progresses, Joe sees Kong less as a disposable assistant and more as a student in need of training. He teaches Kong to defend himself, seemingly because he took pity on Kong after he barely escaped a brutal mugging.Joe also begins considering Kong's questions about whether or not the targets are bad people. Whenever asked, Joe simply responds, ""They're bad to someone."" Indeed, a notorious Bangkok crime lord named Surat (Nirattisai Kaljaruek) considers these four men his biggest enemies. The thing is, one of them is a political figure Kong describes as a good man: ""Thai people love him. He helps poor people and catches bad guys. Like you."" This presumably is one of the reasons Joe begins rethinking his direction in life, although it's difficult to believe he hasn't heard similar things from other errand boys, all of which are dead now. I kept wondering: What is it about this particular mission that turns Joe around? How is Kong so different that Joe is compelled to teach him? It was a missed opportunity for the film, not only because it would add an extra layer to the story, but also because it would better explain the climactic moment at the end, when Joe makes an important decision.The other person he meets is a deaf mute pharmacist named Fon (Charlie Young), who Joe apparently falls in love with from the moment he met her. Their scenes are probably the best the film had to offer, simply because they were forced to communicate without actually speaking. In the original 1999 Thai version of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" (also directed by the Pang Brothers), the hitman is the deaf mute; he relied on his disability in order to be fearless. In this remake, the disability has been given to the love interest, and while this isn't as original or engaging, it still makes for a fascinating examination of two completely different people. I remember a scene of them at a restaurant, one that seems insignificant yet manages to speak volumes; Joe is able to tell Fon that he's eating a very spicy dish, and Fon is able to tell Joe that chewing a special leaf will cool his mouth. In as few words as possible, the two are able to have a full conversation. They're also able to express their feelings for one another. But much like his friendship with Kong, I kept wondering why Joe was able to fall in love this time. Surely he's met other women on assignment. Surely there have been other opportunities. Why is Fon so special? What did she do differently?Maybe it has nothing to do with either Fon or Kong. Maybe Joe is just burned out after years of killing people he didn't even know. It's certainly possible, although I can't say for sure. And that's the biggest problem with ""Bangkok Dangerous""; it tells us that an assassin is losing his edge, but it doesn't tell us why. Some have argued that a reason isn't needed, especially since we generally never wonder why they became assassins in the first place. But I'm not convinced; getting into the business is easy enough to understand, but getting out of it is a much more complex matter, one that, in my opinion, requires some analysis. There isn't a lot of that going on in ""Bangkok Dangerous,"" and as a result, the story was less than it could have been. That being said, the idea behind it is an interesting one, and because of that, I think the film is worth recommending.",4,A Turnaround in Thailand,1220572800,"09 5, 2008",2008,5176,"['ads',

1205425,A3E0IFPCA7KKP9,B001J710XY,Christopher J. Martin,"[1, 1]","This movie stars Nicolas Cage in a completely different role from his character in his two better known National Treasure films. But I have to say, I liked this role a lot too.Cage stars as an anonymous hit man only known as ""Joe"" who obviously has done some very bad deeds around the world. He goes to Bangkok to complete a four hit job for a Bangkok criminal known as Surat. Joe takes the job as his ""one last job"" to make enough money before he retires.On the surface this is a pure action flick. There are plenty of chase scenes through Bangkok and plenty of gun violence. But there's a good movie here beyond that. In the beginning Cage's character clearly only cares about himself and his work, and he's not particularly morally bothered by what he does for a living. But in this movie we find Joe turning into a ""regular guy"" and even meeting a girl in Bangkok who gives him a civilized side. Falling in love with a decent girl makes Joe face up to his criminal past.Having said all that, the basic story isn't very deep.

The camera angles, the sights and sounds of the city, and the cast of colorful characters were all wound together so amazingly that I could watch this movie over and over for years to come.Shahkrit Yamnarm is EXCELLENT as Kong, the street thug recruited by Cage (Joe) to complete his missions while in Bangkok.  He managed to work so well with Cage that the movie took on a whole subplot for me; are these guys going to work together again?  I hope so!This movie has to be added to any Nicolas Cage fan's collection.  The plot is solid, the acting superb, the scenery is fantastic, and the viewer gets a chance to sit back and enjoy a James Bond type thriller without all the British accents.Yes, the shoot-em-up scenes are a little long.  Yes, it's hard to root for a bad guy.  Yes, we've seen movies like this before.  We've just never seen one that combines all the elements of good movie making into on solid movie the way Bangkok Dangerous does.Do yourself a favor; buy Bangkok Dangerous!

1205430,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001J710XY,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[4, 5]","About 30 minutes in, this film jumps the shark. The opening 30 minutes are really very good, excellent film style (unusual photography, sound enhances what you see, interesting lighting, and creative editing), voice over is enlightening, and I was drawn into the film. Once Nicolas Cage is off to Bangkok, the film spirals into something not so good. The original film style and story telling is lost, the film drags on in a story line I've seen 20 or 30 times. It's old hat, the hardened criminal whose heart is melted and turned into gold, in this case, by a young man and a woman. In addition, this is one of the poorest transfers to DVD I've seen in a long time.What really ruined this film for me, where I stopped believing, Nicolas Cage witnesses a simple pick pocket on the streets of Bangkok. From this one chance meeting and event, he decides to use Kong as his assistant. To the viewer, Kong is a bumbling idiot. For still more confusing reasons, he decides to teach Kong instead of killing him. He also meets a beautiful young woman in a pharmacy that happens to be deaf. He immediately falls in love with her and becomes obsessed with being with her. The obsession is so deep that the hardened assasian breaks all four of his ""rules"" trying to be with her. From this point, about 30 to 40 minutes in, the film spirals out of control. There's just too many moments where you don't believe the action - the boat scene where he chases a king pin of crime, his escape from the assasination attempt, and the ""dead man walking"" sequence at the end. There's also way too many moments of doey eyed Nicolas Cage just looking at the camera. We get to watch about 3 or 4 minutes of Nicolas eating spicey Asian food and sweating. I like Nicolas Cage very much, 8MM, National Treasure, Matchstick Men, The Weather Man - all well acted, fine films. He's just made another film like Ghost Rider this time. The film just doesn't stick together.The DVD transfer - there were many moments where Mpeg-2 compression hurt this film, mostly dark skies that showed color banding artifacts. The sound was very flat and two dimensional, very low quality (this was viewed on a calibrated high end surround system - if the quality was there it would have come through).DVD Special features, thin, a making of and an alternate ending. The original ending is fine, maybe a bit melodramatic, but fitting. The alternate, happily ever after ending, fits better with the overall film of how could that happen? In this case, how could 100 police not catch somebody stealing a police car right in front of them?If you loved Ghost Rider, my guess, you'll love this film. If you want your action film to be believeable or at least some closeness to probable, you'll not like this film at all.

This guy is a professional hitman and goes to Bangkok speaking no Thai and is expected to do all these hits?2. There was no local person who could have done these hits? Better yet: Do we really expect a man who was not familiar with Thailand to find all these specific places (without being seen) to do all these hits?3. During the first of the hits, he shot a rapid fire machine gun into a crowd of traffic and then just rode away on his motorcycle? (Being a white foreigner in  Thailand, was there anyplace that he could have hidden?)4. During the second hit, he held a man underwater long enough to drown him while staying underwater himself at the same time and coming up for air not one time? Is there any human being who has the lung capacity to do this?5. In between these unbelievable hits, he manages to romance a normal (non hooker) Thai girl? And she's deaf? And she takes him home to meet her family after only one date? (Non hooking Thai women would not be caught dead with a foreigner in real life.)6. We get back to more hits (all equally improbable): This time, it's a gunfight in a river market that goes on for a distance of something like 2 miles-- and no one seems to notice or get caught during this whole thing.7. Lastly, the hitman takes out something like 17 men (many of whom had rapid fire weapons) with two single shooters and then kills himself after ALL THAT?8. Would a real life hitman have been this sloppy? Would he have formed such a bond with an assistant that he met solely for the purposes of being a local guide (especially after he'd just killed the others that he worked with with no remorse)?

Nicholas Cage is a professional assassin and is hired to murder four men in Thailand.  He's jaded from a lifetime of doing this and makes it a rule to not have any emotional attachments.  As a matter of fact, when the film opens and he is leaving his last job, we see him murder the young man who has been his assistant.  So when he gets to Thailand and immediately engages a new young assistant the audience knows what he holds in store for the young man.  The young man worships the assassin though and soon we find the assassin becoming the young man's mentor.  That's when we sense that this job will be different from all others.  This is especially true when he starts to court an attractive Thai female pharmacist who happens to be a deaf mute.  Amongst the murders and the violence, her presence introduces the assassin to another way of life.There's a lot of violence in this fast paced action film.  Something interesting seems to happen in every frame.  It kept my eyes wide as the story unfolded to its inevitable conclusion.Nicholas Cage is a fine actor.

Nicolas Cage who did a good job in Next returns with a even better performance in this movie. With age many a person has had to look over there choices and perhaps develop a conscience.  That happens here in this story and the movie must be applauded for not going for the typical happy ending that destroyed movies like the American version of ""The Vanishing"".  Here the Americanized version isn't too bad, and while not a great flick it is a good movie in which the lead character is not a indestructible  video game being. Not that movies like 'Wanted"" are terrible for featuring that type of unrealistic hero though.  This is just more realistic and it is well worth seeing on blu ray.

If you've never seen the original, superior film, you really should; it's a great movie. Better on so many levels that there is really no comparison between the two except the basics of the plot, the setting, and the character names. Admittedly this review is influenced by my like of the original, but remember that all reviews are opinion, and if you disagree with me, don't take it personally.The story of a tired hit man who needs just 'one more job' to retire permanently from the business of permanently retiring people has been done many times before. In this version of that storyline, BANGKOK DANGEROUS, the hit-man Joe is played by Nicholas Cage. Joe travels to Thailand where he has four 'jobs,' to complete. Although bedraggled and looking like he needs a hug, Joe proves ruthlessly efficient. After learning that the last 'job,' is a lot more than what he bargained for, Joe is forced to make tough choices about how he will respond, and what the consequences will be for himself, his protege, and the entire nation of Thailand.Cage is suitable for the part and grinds his way through this one with a sullenness that fits his character, even if the battered, world-wise assassin has become a cliche. The real issue here is that unlike the original, he is not deaf nor mute. Those attributes have instead been given to his love interest in what I can only assume was the director's desire to 'get their money's worth' out of Cage.What made the original BANGKOK DANGEROUS so good was the that the protagonist was a remarkably interesting character, free from typical hit-man cliches, as well as the fantastic visuals of a seedy, very un-western Bangkok. Both of those elements have been glamorized and reduced to stereotypes in this adaptation. Bangkok from the original to this one seems a different city entirely, more glitzy than gritty, an Americanized version that has lost its exotic appeal.As harmful as these changes are, there are still some great moments in this version. There are several top-notch action sequences including some awesome hand-to-hand combat scenes that have learned a thing or two from the Bourne movies. The relationship between Cage's character and the streetwise Thai man Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) he hires as his local help is at times very well done and surprisingly believable. The films best moments are centered around this relationship and the psychological shifts that Joe's character must make in response to his growing relationship with Kong.2.5/5 stars. I suggest renting this alongside the original and watching them both.

1205474,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001J710XY,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[1, 2]","Oxide and Danny Pang have made a name for themselves with the Asian horror film ""The Eye"" and more recently, ""Re-Cycle"". After their abysmal Hollywood outing, ""The Messengers"", the twin brothers have decided to give mainstream Hollywood films another try with a re-imagining of their very own low-budget cult hit ""Bangkok Dangerous"". This remake is titled the same and has Nicholas Cage in the lead; the two filmmakers are also armed with a bigger budget. So how does this U.S. made remake compare with the Thai original?Joe (Nicholas Cage) is a hitman with uncanny stealth skills. Joe plans, then he kills, then he leaves without a trace after the job is done. He is sent to Thailand to carry out a series of ""hits"" and enlists the aid of a drifter named Kong (Shahkrit Shamnarm) to be his main messenger to his new clients. After a job, Joe is slightly wounded and stumbles upon a pharmacy where he meets a beautiful deaf-mute pharmacist (played by Charlie Yeung) who awakens a sense of conscience and sympathy within the killer-for-hire. Joe's last job is to assassinate a beloved politician, and he finds himself declining the assignment. Now he finds himself the target of the crime family and Joe must find it deep within himself to consider the safety of his newfound friends. With something to lose, Joe must kill for a different cause.The Pang Bros. may have been labeled as innovators in Hong Kong horror, but their films are mostly a hit or miss. Their return to shallow Hollywood won't make or break their careers, and as much as I am turned off by remakes, at least the Pangs are in familiar territory. This new ""Bangkok.."" does have the usual Pang bros. touch and contains pretty much the same plot devices (well, not everything) but don't assume that just because it has the same directors, almost the same amount of action, that it is on par with the original.The original had a lot of emotions. Kong is actually the hitman's name in the original ""Bangkok.."" and he was the deaf hitman with a good heart. The names are almost the same but some of the characters have been interchanged. The original was about revenge and a killer with a heart of gold. While this remake does try to find a conscience, the film is hampered with the severely miscast Nic Cage. I'm not sure, I'm not exactly a fan of the actor (but I don't hate him either) but I know he has his good moments such as in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" but I really had issues with him as the lead. His portrayal appears so robotic and the character required someone who would not stand out--someone simple who can just blend in. An American in Thailand is very conspicuous and not invisible. Also, I guess the Pangs tried to make the experience a moody and brooding one, and Cage is just too uninviting for this role.The direction is definitely trendy and stylish. The Pangs does use the usual Hong Kong-inspired action sequences. Lots of explosions, gunfire, and armed with a bigger budget, they try to prove that they can hang with Johnnie To, John Woo, Luc Besson and Tony Scott. The Ronny Yu-inspired ""blurring vision"" in the original is curiously missing here. There is some decent action to be had, there is nudity, blood and some gore. The cinematography is dark, and the colors appear to be a little muted probably to convey some mood. There is a lot of eye-candy visuals and the women aren't bad to look at. Aom the dancer (played by Panward Hemmanee) is sultry and sexy; while Fon (Charlie Yeung) is the type you marry. There are some nifty nightclub scenes that will no doubt excite the male audience.The weird thing about the film is that it truly tries to find emotion but it barely does. I really don't think Cage is the one wholly at fault, so I guess it is just a little too incoherent and too stylish. To convey effective emotion the shots have to be simple to let the characters breath and have a life of their own. There is a scene with a lot of potential for emotions when Joe kills two muggers as witnessed by Fon, but it still felt a little empty and cold. The final scene attempts to be an emotional heartbreaker but it ends up a little too perfunctory and dry, it just felt too hollow.I guess the film just ends up a popcorn affair. It isn't a total failure but it sure isn't a good film. The film doesn't offer any memorable grand spectacles of gunplay, action and thrills but thank goodness it wasn't a lot messier--it could have been a lot more ""dangerously"" forgettable.RENTAL [2  -Stars]Video/Audio: Anamorphic widescreen 2.40 ratio.
