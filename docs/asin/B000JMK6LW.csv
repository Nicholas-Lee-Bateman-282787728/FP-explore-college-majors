I would because it causes a lobotomy and knowing that would be enough for me to not take it. Now the ""interpolated rotoscoping"" technique -- Been there done that. It's just not as cool the second time. WAKING LIFE, also directed by the same guy, was fantastic and fun to watch. This here, not so much. On top of that I saw this animation in TV commercials which pretty much did for this style of animation what TV commercials did for all those classic rock songs I used to sort of like.Credit for staying respectful to the source material, but it didn't work for me. Not the worst PDK film adaptation though. I'm always waiting for the next BLADE RUNNER that will never come. If you dig the animation in this movie check out WAKING LIFE.

Innovative from the first frame, the only comparisons I can come up with is an advanced, artful leap from `Adult Swim' from The Cartoon Network or the adults' version of `The Polar Express'.  Easily more fluid than either, the animation at first may come off as unnecessary, flashy, or just plain irritating.  But once you get your brain hemispheres adjusted, you realize there is real method to the madness.  But, oh boy, what madness.  The effect works to have the audience with one foot in solid reality and another in unreality.  What `A Scanner Darkly' does is connect with the real life of drugs.  (If that isn't a contradiction, then what is?)With Stephen Sodenheim (significantly of `Traffic' fame) as co-ex producer with George Clooney, the drug world has a new dimension.  We start off with Charles Freck who is undergoing a drug psychosis.  He can't do anything to get the bugs that are crawling all over him, showering, spraying himself with bug killer, etc.  They keep coming back.  In the next scene, officer Fred (Keanu Reeves) is lecturing other comrades in their war against drugs.  His appearance is morphing because he's an undercover cop who is a living specimen for the latest technology in waging that war.  He shares his notes about ""substance D,"" the ultimate, addictive drug of the near future world.  Familiarly, it is a flower derivative, and whatever its euphoric traits aren't entirely certain, but its power to hook are unparalleled.  Its side effects are somewhat unique (although I'll leave you to the movie to find them) but Charles Freck has already given us clues to their impact.  Much of the film goes through the house life of Freck, his ruthlessly cunning dealer, Jim Barris, and their California dude friend (Woody Harrelson).  In between we back up, and Fred looks through his scanner into the drug world he's bugged and at his personal life with his girlfriend, Donna (Winona Rider) who is in her own way woven into the web of drugs and illusion.`A Scanner Darkly' is worth a look for its keen vision of the world it is meant to penetrate.  The film also innovates the method and style in which movies are being made. (Mostly kudos are due to Richard Linklater and his ""rotoscoping"" method.) Sorting out the dimensions of paranoia with the reality of surveillance and the supply and demand of stellar drugs, `A Scanner Darkly' provides an uniquely intriguing movie experience.",4,Drug Casualties,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,2495,"['first', 'thing', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'animation', 'Innovative', 'first', 'frame', 'only', 'comparisons', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'advanced', 'artful', 'leap', 'Adult', 'Swim', 'Cartoon', 'Network', 'adults', 'version', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Easily', 'more', 'fluid', 'either', 'animation', 'first', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'unnecessary', 'flashy', 'just', 'plain', 'irritating', 'once', 'get', 'brain', 'hemispheres', 'adjusted', 'realize', 'real', 'method', 'madness', 'oh', 'boy', 'what', 'madness', 'effect', 'have', 'audience', 'one', 'foot', 'solid', 'reality', 'unreality', 'What', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'connect', 'real', 'life', 'drugs', ""n't"", 'contradiction', 'then', 'what', 'Stephen', 'Sodenheim', 'significantly', 'Traffic', 'fame', 'co-ex', 'producer', 'George', 'Clooney', 'drug', 'world', 'new', 'dimension', 'start', 'Charles', 'Freck', 'who', 'undergoing', 'drug', 'psychosis', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'bugs', 'are', 'crawling', 'showering', 'spraying', 'bug', 'killer', 'etc', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'next', 'scene', 'officer', 'Fred', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'lecturing', 'other', 'comrades', 'war', 'drugs', 'appearance', 'morphing', 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'living', 'specimen', 'latest', 'technology', 'waging', 'war', 'shares', 'notes', 'substance', 'D', 'ultimate', 'addictive', 'drug', 'near', 'future', 'world', 'Familiarly', 'flower', 'derivative', 'whatever', 'euphoric', 'traits', 'are', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'certain', 'power', 'hook', 'are', 'unparalleled', 'side', 'effects', 'are', 'somewhat', 'unique', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'movie', 'find', 'Charles', 'Freck', 'already', 'given', 'clues', 'impact', 'Much', 'film', 'house', 'life', 'Freck', 'ruthlessly', 'cunning', 'dealer', 'Jim', 'Barris', 'California', 'dude', 'friend', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'back', 'up', 'Fred', 'scanner', 'drug', 'world', 'bugged', 'personal', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'Donna', 'Winona', 'Rider', 'who', 'own', 'way', 'woven', 'web', 'drugs', 'illusion.', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'look', 'keen', 'vision', 'world', 'meant', 'penetrate', 'film', 'also', 'method', 'style', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'Mostly', 'kudos', 'are', 'due', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'rotoscoping', 'method', 'Sorting', 'out', 'dimensions', 'paranoia', 'reality', 'surveillance', 'supply', 'demand', 'stellar', 'drugs', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'uniquely', 'intriguing', 'movie', 'experience']",N/A

Safianow ""Kiddo""","[2, 4]","This movie seemed to set out to be the next Crash, the next Sin City, to not only visually appease you, but leave you paralyzed in a complex message about yourself, about the way you think, the way you live. This movie does make you think, has a brilliant script, excellent backdrop, and appealing characters, but leaves you trying to pick out the pieces in the end. A great movie, at least worth a rent, but it seems to be a love it or hate it film.I thought that the performances were very good, especially due to the 5-star script, but the movie's pace could have been faster, and delt with more enthusiasm. The plot revolves around this drug called Substance D. This drug is highly addictive, ""either you are on it, or you haven't tried it yet"" and causes the user to hallucenate... seeing bugs and insects in your hair and on your skin, and people become partial bugs. In this not to distant future, the government is trying to track down Substance D users to try to find the people higher up on the ladder, distributing the drug.The story is very compelling, but the pace leaves you not quite dazzled. The movie was directed with too much emphasis on the impressing the viewer with visuals and complex dialogue, that the viewer is overwhelmed. The movie was trying to become bigger than it is, and although it's good, it is not Oscar-worthy.

1028796,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B000JMK6LW,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[33, 42]","Phillip K. Dick's story of rampant drug use in the near future should serve as a warning to us today about what could happen if we don't make any progress in the ""war on drugs"" soon.  Taking place in Anaheim seven years from, Keanu Reeves plays Bob Arctor, a cop who works for the sheriff's department.  He is a deep undercover agent; in fact, he is so deep that his own agency doesn't even know his real name.  He is known only as Fred, his codename.  To keep his identity annonymous, he wears something called a scramble suit while working.  The suit distorts his appearance and voice using prerecorded images and sound to mask his true form.  His assignment forces him to infiltrate drug rings and earn their trust so that he can discover their supplier.  In this world, most of America is hooked on something called Substance D, a highly addictive drug that wreaks havoc on the mind.  When Bob is not at the office, we see him with a group of addicts, each of whom has had different reactions to the drug.  Jim Barris (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an insane conspiracy theorist who tries to make homemade gun silencers with only himself in mind when it comes to protection from the law.  Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson) is fried; he is prone to sudden mood swings, choking, and mad ravings.  Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder) gets the drugs from the supplier and is very paranoid; she doesn't let anyone touch her, much to Bob's dismay.  Finally, there is Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane), who is only a fringe member of the group.  He is so adversely affected by Substance D that he is seeing bugs all over himself and barely wants to live anymore.  Bob, however, seems to have it the worst.  He became addicted to keep his cover, and now his brain may be malfuntioning.  His superior ""suggests"" that he see the department's psychologists, and what he learns is terrifying: His brain's two hemispheres are competing for dominance due to extensive damage to the once-prominent left hemisphere.  Soon, Bob is experiencing things he shouldn't; he has vivid visions of his life before becoming a cop, he hears voices of people who aren't there, and begins to hallucinate.  It doesn't help that Barris is right about some of his conspiracy theories; the government has resorted to ""scanning"" people's lives.  Cameras and sound recording equipment are everywhere, phones are bugged, and someone watches everything that everyone does.I don't want to give anything away, but the viewer eventually learns that neither side is just in the war on drugs.  Dealers and suppliers are getting rich off of making people dependent on their junk, but it turns out that the noble soldiers trying to help us may not be so noble after all.The most impressive thing about the film is the visual style.  Director Richard Linklater used the unique animation technique in his film Waking Life, but it still comes off as fresh and original.  Animating over scenes shot with live actors allows for interesting effects and a surreal feel to the film.  All of the actors do very well, even Keanu.  While he often seems monotonous, he shows us that he can actually act in this film.  Downey and Harrelson are hilarious as the drugged-out characters Barris and Luckman, and while Ryder doesn't get that much screentime in the first half of the film, she does give a good performance.The story is good, but viewers must pay close attention to everything.  Tiny, insignificant details at the beginning become very relevant towards the end (yes, this is nothing new, but one very important thing isn't revealed until the very final scene).  The film isn't for someone looking for a fun action piece, this is a serious film that requires the viewer to use their brain.  If you want a summer popcorn flick or aren't a fan of Phillip Dick or Linklater, this film isn't for you.  However, it is a good film, and anyone who wants to see an interesting look at the drug war should definitely see the film.",4,A Cautionary Tale That Cautions Against Both Sides of the Drug War,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,3958,"['Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'story', 'rampant', 'drug', 'use', 'near', 'future', 'should', 'serve', 'warning', 'today', 'what', 'could', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'progress', 'war', 'drugs', 'soon', 'Taking', 'place', 'Anaheim', 'seven', 'years', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Bob', 'Arctor', 'cop', 'who', 'sheriff', 'department', 'deep', 'undercover', 'agent', 'fact', 'so', 'deep', 'own', 'agency', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'real', 'name', 'known', 'only', 'Fred', 'codename', 'keep', 'identity', 'annonymous', 'something', 'called', 'scramble', 'suit', 'working', 'suit', 'appearance', 'voice', 'using', 'prerecorded', 'images', 'sound', 'mask', 'true', 'form', 'assignment', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'rings', 'earn', 'trust', 'so', 'can', 'discover', 'supplier', 'world', 'most', 'America', 'hooked', 'something', 'called', 'Substance', 'D', 'highly', 'addictive', 'drug', 'havoc', 'mind', 'When', 'Bob', 'not', 'office', 'see', 'group', 'addicts', 'whom', 'had', 'different', 'reactions', 'drug', 'Jim', 'Barris', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'insane', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'who', 'make', 'homemade', 'gun', 'silencers', 'only', 'mind', 'when', 'protection', 'law', 'Ernie', 'Luckman', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'fried', 'prone', 'sudden', 'mood', 'swings', 'choking', 'mad', 'ravings', 'Donna', 'Hawthorne', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'drugs', 'supplier', 'very', 'paranoid', ""n't"", 'let', 'anyone', 'touch', 'much', 'Bob', 'dismay', 'Finally', 'Charles', 'Freck', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'who', 'only', 'fringe', 'member', 'group', 'so', 'adversely', 'affected', 'Substance', 'D', 'seeing', 'bugs', 'barely', 'live', 'anymore', 'Bob', 'however', 'have', 'worst', 'became', 'addicted', 'keep', 'cover', 'now', 'brain', 'may', 'be', 'malfuntioning', 'superior', 'suggests', 'see', 'department', 'psychologists', 'what', 'terrifying', 'brain', 'two', 'hemispheres', 'are', 'competing', 'dominance', 'due', 'extensive', 'damage', 'once-prominent', 'left', 'hemisphere', 'Soon', 'Bob', 'experiencing', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'vivid', 'visions', 'life', 'becoming', 'cop', 'voices', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'hallucinate', ""n't"", 'help', 'Barris', 'right', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'government', 'resorted', 'scanning', 'people', 'lives', 'Cameras', 'sound', 'recording', 'equipment', 'are', 'everywhere', 'phones', 'are', 'bugged', 'someone', 'watches', 'everything', 'everyone', 'does.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'viewer', 'eventually', 'side', 'just', 'war', 'drugs', 'Dealers', 'suppliers', 'are', 'getting', 'rich', 'making', 'people', 'dependent', 'junk', 'out', 'noble', 'soldiers', 'trying', 'help', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'so', 'noble', 'all.The', 'most', 'impressive', 'thing', 'film', 'visual', 'style', 'Director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'used', 'unique', 'animation', 'technique', 'film', 'Waking', 'Life', 'still', 'off', 'fresh', 'original', 'Animating', 'scenes', 'shot', 'live', 'actors', 'interesting', 'effects', 'surreal', 'feel', 'film', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'even', 'Keanu', 'often', 'monotonous', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'film', 'Downey', 'Harrelson', 'are', 'hilarious', 'drugged-out', 'characters', 'Barris', 'Luckman', 'Ryder', ""n't"", 'get', 'that', 'much', 'screentime', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'give', 'good', 'performance.The', 'story', 'good', 'viewers', 'must', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'everything', 'Tiny', 'insignificant', 'details', 'beginning', 'become', 'very', 'relevant', 'end', 'yes', 'nothing', 'new', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'thing', ""n't"", 'revealed', 'very', 'final', 'scene', 'film', ""n't"", 'someone', 'looking', 'fun', 'action', 'piece', 'serious', 'film', 'viewer', 'use', 'brain', 'want', 'summer', 'popcorn', 'flick', 'are', ""n't"", 'fan', 'Phillip', 'Dick', 'Linklater', 'film', ""n't"", 'However', 'good', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'interesting', 'look', 'drug', 'war', 'should', 'definitely', 'see', 'film']",N/A
1028797,A4VH04TA14CPE,B000JMK6LW,"Angry Mofo ""angrymofo""","[5, 5]","This is the best existing Dick adaptation (yes, better thanthat other one), largely because it's very faithful to the original. This alone is a brave move in our day, when films that are ""based on"" books attempt to ""improve"" the story by adding extra car chases and happy endings. The few liberties that A Scanner Darkly does take are minor and probably necessary to present Dick's sprawlingstoryas a film. For example, the characters of Jerry Fabin and Charles Freck are merged together into one shaggy, doughy guy, which is pretty much exactly how Jerry comes across in the book. More importantly, the dark ending (plus Dick's sorrowful afterword) is uncompromisingly left intact.The film has only two notable departures from the book, one good and one not. The good one occurs when the camera briefly follows Arctor's masked boss ""Hank"" down the hall and into the locker room. The resulting image was never stated in Dick's book, but it's much more effective visually than it probably would have been on the page, and it's in keeping with Dick's twist ending. The less inspired moment occurs when Donna tells Arctor about her dream of running off to Oregon. Arctor asks her if he could come along. In the book, she unequivocally refuses, but I guess the director thought that was too hopeless, because here she implies that it might be possible. I prefer Dick's version, because I think that it highlights Arctor's feelings of being lost more starkly.I had some initial reservations about the casting ofKeanu Reevesas Arctor, but he actually does a credible job. Arctor's disassociation from himself, when he begins to view himself as ""Fred,"" occurs a bit suddenly in the film, but I had that same problem with the book. Also, the other characters are brilliantly cast. The film gets Barris perfectly -- a non-descript, smug motor-mouth who can always spin an explanation of why everything is everyone's fault but his own, who peppers his speech with big words and brags about his erudition without having any real systematic knowledge about anything. He's the erudite junkie, the guy who always has a pseudo-scientific explanation of why his particular drug is better and healthier than all others. But then, A Scanner Darkly does drugpedantryvery well, both book and film. Everyone says defensively that they don't do that much Substance D, and Donna makes a big point of how she won't inject it (because that's so unhealthy, you see).The film even keeps the aimless drug conversations -- another brave and laudable move, keeping dialogue that doesn't solely serve to advance the plot. The script is mostly taken from the book, and the last scene with Freck is accompanied by a voice-over narration -- there's just no way to improve on Dick's writing in that scene. When the characters talk, the film proves beyond all doubt that Dick was a prodigiously talented stylist. It is a great pleasure to hear people talking with rich, detailed, energetic flourishes, with quirks that don't sound like they were written by a Hollywood hack.The only problem is that I feel there should be even more of this. The film is short, less than two hours long. Sure, you can't cram every single line of dialogue into it, but even five or ten extra minutes could have helped. Most notably, the ending is cut short -- the film only shows a brief glimpse of Arctor in the New-Path facility. As a result, it doesn't really convey the extent of his deterioration. We see that he had a bad episode of withdrawal in Donna's car, but it's hard to tell just how devastating the effects were. As a result, the very last image in the field doesn't quite have the effect that it should.The visuals are great -- the use of animation was an inspired touch, allowing for more iconic and archetypal movements and mannerisms, which suits Dick's writing style. Yet, sometimes, the visual aspect completely changes the mood. Like the book, the film begins with Fabin/Freck scrubbing bugs out of his hair. In the film, this is a kinetic montage, with him rushing back and forth, close-ups on his anguished face, dark techno music, and so on. However, the book takes a measured, deadpan tone: ""Once a guy stood all day shaking bugs from his hair."" At first, there is no way of knowing that this is a drug-induced hallucination. It's easy to take it literally, as an opening to some grotesquely comic sci-fi story about alien bugs. When Fabin's degradation becomes clear, it hits like a sucker punch.It's even a bit hard to explain why other scenes feel short. When Arctor snaps at the two medical deputies and asks them how he could win Donna's affection (they suggest buying her flowers), it sounds funny and cool in the book, like lines from ahard-boileddetective novel. But in the film, it looks jarring and sudden. Donna doesn't have enough screen time to really set up Arctor's love. It's also like that in the book -- I checked, and it seems that no scenes with her have been omitted -- but the book has more inner monologue, the scene at Donna's apartment is longer, and there is also a longer, sweeter reconciliation after Arctor walks out. Just a couple more minutes of film could have corrected this!I think this is a fine film, but it's more enjoyable after you've read the book. If you haven't, your impression might be a bit disjointed. Dick's book is really more about seventies Californian drug culture than science fiction. Even though the film is very faithful, it goes through some scenes so quickly that its world isn't quite as recognizable.",4,"Great adaptation, though it goes a bit fast.",1282694400,"08 25,

1028804,A26PAN8REXYBYH,B000JMK6LW,"Brian M. Ranzoni ""Da Killa B""","[2, 2]","...Capsule Review...I liked this film. Linklater manages to achieve a similar effect found in Goodfellas--people who literally amuse themselves to death. I can relate to the theme of friends divided and conquered. That said, if you don't enjoy drug humor or dark satire, steer clear....Main Review...I watch a lot of movies and I read a lot of books, but few affect me. Most stories are either pure thrills, full of bull puckey, or both. While Richard Linklater's latest film, A Scanner Darkly shovels plenty of both, it also offers more heart and tells more truth than most manage.Mainly because it adapts from Philip K. Dick, one of those writers who deserves to be much more well known than he actually is. A Scanner Darkly is the first novel I've read in years that has set me on fire. Published the year I was born, this tale of drug punishment flows with one humorous vignette after another, all atop a treacherous undertow....A Synopsis Darkly...The movie plays faithfully to the book. America is being destroyed by Substance D, a drug turning people into docile zombies. A rehab-industrial complex handles the mindless citizens, who become janitors and farm laborers.Especially around Southern California, and a ring of friends who deal in ""slow death"". Bob Arctor is a noob Dr. Feelgood who dates veteran Donna Hawthorn. Together they hang with Bob's housemates: the surfer-turned-addict Ernie Luckman, the mechanic-turned-paranoid Charles Freck, and fried intellectual Jim Barris.Bob rooms these crazy kids because he is also undercover agent Fred. Unfortunately, he has become closer to the dealers than to his fellow cops. Close enough to become as sincere an addict as a friend... As Fred climbs the chain, his grip on his own sanity begins to slip. And as Bob becomes close to his partners-in-crime, it becomes clear that one is out to burn him. Clear to all but Fred-Bob, whose drug-addled view of himself becomes very dark indeed....Don't Get High on Your Own Supply...In both book and film, Fred claims he needed the cover to blend in; an excuse so weak the audience jumps on him before Hank does. His real motivation remains unspoken: Fred is loyal to the law, but Bob is loyal to his people.Unfortunately, the film doesn't convey the love for these people that the novel implies. Most of Dick's soliloquies are reduced to voice-over monologues. More troubling, the characters antagonize each other more, as the film pumps up existing confrontations and introduces new fights. They sweat suspicion. Overall, the book characters are much more sympathetic, which reflects Dick's theme of kids punished overmuch for what they did. The novel prefers to imply tension through plot and scene development.Both approaches work, however, because the characters become so stir-fried that the most obvious signs of betrayal get lost in D-induced head trips.As real conspiracies become more murderous, one character calmly reveals that he rigged a hidden microphone, to be activated if the front door opened. To be sure intruders don't sneak in elsewhere, he left the front door unlocked, with a note for good measure. This scene is hilarious. But even as the audience belly-laughs, they might feel a knot of tension. Because Fred arranged for the police to plant cameras in their absence.Plans within plans, as the late Frank Herbert wrote. Our protagonists are more like those in a Douglas Adams novel, stumbling around a dark basement for a clue locked in the bottom of a file cabinet in a disused bathroom marked ""Beware of the Leopard"". As much as these scenes play for laughs, Linklater knew to keep the undercurrent of desperation....Window Pain...So Link manages a bit of character study. Like Bob, the audience gets to know these folks better than the ""straight"" people, who all look the same behind sunglasses, makeup, riot helmets, or scramble suits. The movie is structured so the audience can be sucked into the head-trips of the characters; I recommend doing this because otherwise some of the plot twists will seem too predictable.Personally, I found the movie easy to understand. People made the mistake of dismissing dialogue in Pulp Fiction as pointless, and so they missed all clues and a lot of spice. ASD also requires an attentive ear.It already attracts the eye. The film uses animation traced over live footage to generate a graphic novel texture. Actually, I didn't notice the overlay most of the time. It's rendered as life-like as possible while still being animation. However, the technique enables the film to reproduce effectively the hardware and hallucinations of the novel. Scramble suits and holo scanners look purty cool. Since America does not have a strong adult animation industry, at least in Hollywood, I'm pleased to see this attempt.On a final note, plenty of minor differences and surprises exist between the book and the movie. Linklater combines several characters, such as Jerry Fabin and Charles Freck. He updated most references to the 1960's and `70's, especially the slang. I found it amusing when, amid all of the futuristic gadgetry, a character pulls out a modern digital player. Dick still had people using eight-tracks in his future, you see.I don't think it's the great American Movie, but A Scanner Darkly inspired me to read the novel. I think many viewers can relate to the theme of friends who fall apart, and take the strength of the group with them.",4,A Humor Darkly,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,5417,"['Capsule', 'Review',

If you are not into people turning into bugs or junkies freaking out over trivial events, this movie is not for you. However, if you find conspiracy theory intriguing and dark comedies inviting, by all means buy this DVD.The best part about this movie was the animation. I've never seen the film ""Waking Life"" however the director, Richard Linklater used the same animation in both films. To devote so much time to a film is awe inspiring. To not only direct a regular film with live actors and backgrounds but then to go back over it with animation. It's amazing.The acting was good. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal,  and Woody Harelson fits the Junkie California dude profile to a tee ( we can look at this two ways, both are wonderful actors who have developed their craft very well, however it is no secret Woody and Robert have done extensive research in the underground drug culture). But Rory Cochrane steals the show as the scratching, fiending, suicidal Freck that at one point is told every sin he has committed by a green monster with roughly a thousand eyes. Keanu Reeves is his adorable beautiful self, meaning the only reason he still gets work is that he is attractive. Not even animation can make Reeves resemble an actor. He however is just supplemental in comparison to the rest of the cast. He does not make or break this picture.While I believe that the direction and acting are superb, the film lacks substance. It lacks closure. Why won't Wynona Ryder put out? Does Reeves ever escape the imprisonment of Substance D (Metaphorically or physically)? What was the end result of the other characters? While this film has twists, turns, ups, and downs, and I consider it to be a good representation of not only addict culture but the seedy operations of our government as well, that does not excuse the fact that it leaves many unanswered questions.",3,anatomy of an addiction,1170547200,"02 4, 2007",2007,1922,"['movie', 'say', 'absolute', 'least', 'bit', 'strange', 'are', 'not', 'people', 'turning', 'bugs', 'junkies', 'freaking', 'out', 'trivial', 'events', 'movie', 'not', 'However', 'find', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'intriguing', 'dark', 'comedies', 'inviting', 'means', 'buy', 'DVD.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'Waking', 'Life', 'however', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'used', 'same', 'animation', 'films', 'devote', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'film', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'not', 'only', 'direct', 'regular', 'film', 'live', 'actors', 'backgrounds', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'animation', 'amazing.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'phenomenal', 'Woody', 'Harelson', 'Junkie', 'California', 'dude', 'profile', 'tee', 'can', 'look', 'two', 'ways', 'are', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'developed', 'craft', 'very', 'well', 'however', 'secret', 'Woody', 'Robert', 'have', 'done', 'extensive', 'research', 'underground', 'drug', 'culture', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'show', 'scratching', 'fiending', 'suicidal', 'Freck', 'one', 'point', 'told', 'sin', 'committed', 'green', 'monster', 'roughly', 'thousand', 'eyes', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'adorable', 'beautiful', 'self', 'meaning', 'only', 'reason', 'still', 'work', 'attractive', 'Not', 'even', 'animation', 'can', 'make', 'Reeves', 'resemble', 'actor', 'however', 'just', 'supplemental', 'comparison', 'rest', 'cast', 'not', 'make', 'break', 'picture.While', 'believe', 'direction', 'acting', 'are', 'superb', 'film', 'substance', 'closure', 'Why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Wynona', 'Ryder', 'put', 'out', 'Does', 'Reeves', 'ever', 'escape', 'imprisonment', 'Substance', 'D', 'Metaphorically', 'physically', 'What', 'was', 'end', 'result', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'twists', 'turns', 'ups', 'downs', 'consider', 'be', 'good', 'representation', 'not', 'only', 'addict', 'culture', 'seedy', 'operations', 'government', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'excuse', 'fact', 'many', 'unanswered', 'questions']",N/A
1028809,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000JMK6LW,Chris Pandolfi,"[144, 165]","Here's the interesting thing about Richard Linklater's ""A Scanner Darkly"": for a film about heavy drug use set in the not too distant future, it's probably one of the most honest and complex anti-drug stories ever told. I say this in spite of the fact that I found the specifics of the plot incredibly difficult to grasp. All I could comprehend were the general bits of information, most of which were gathered from trailers and commercials. Apparently, a fictional drug called Substance D rules the streets of Orange County, California. It's a highly addictive, brain-frying narcotic that has a long list of negative side effects. It's also an illegal substance, one that undercover cop Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves) has gotten quite familiar with in his attempt to locate its main distributor. Upon infiltrating the home of a group of pill popping slackers, he starts using in order to blend in. Unfortunately, this drugged lifestyle eventually leaves him unable to distinguish reality from hallucinations.Through the cinematic process of rotoscoping, Linklater has enabled the audience to feel the exact same way as Arctor does. Each frame of film was traced over and stylistically repainted, making the world the characters live in--as well as the characters themselves--look half like a cartoon and half like the physical realm. It was an absolutely incredible look, and I found that it gave the story an added dimension by representing a kind of realistic unreality (if that makes any sense at all). In that sense, it's almost symbolic that the undercover cops wear scramble suits, which are high tech cloaks with anatomical images that continuously shift from one to the next (apparently, a single suit can project millions of appearances). The state of the world these characters live in is ruled by uncertainty and deception. Arctor is ultimately tested, not only in terms of what he believes to be the truth, but in terms of his state of mind, as well.I now understand why that rotoscoping process was used for an adaptation of a Philip K. Dick novel. Only he could have written about the life-destroying effects of an addictive substance. Likewise, only this kind of film can do justice to the point he was trying to make, namely that you can't trust anyone, especially when you're addicted to a powerful drug. Unfortunately, elaborating on that point would give too much away; I will say that all in this movie isn't exactly as it seems, and more than a couple of characters have hidden agendas. There are a number of truths hidden amongst the film's eccentric style, and by the time you get halfway through, you're completely lost.However, this is the kind of movie you don't mind getting lost in, even if you have no idea what's going on. I have to admit that while I understood the underlying message of the story, I barely understood this film as a whole. Watching the sequences unfold and listening to the characters interact is almost as brain scrambling as the evil Substance D is. This is especially true of the conversations between James Barris (Robert Downey, Jr.), Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson), and Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane), three of Arctor's equally spaced out friends. Their esoteric banter flows seamlessly from topic to topic in an Altered Consciousness sort of way, filled with anti-establishment ramblings that almost come off as poetic. It even gets comical at times; during a road trip to San Diego, Barris claims he left the front door of their house unlocked and attached a note for burglars to read (which, supposedly, was all part of an elaborate scheme to record the intruder and solve the mystery behind the Substance D ring).There are some interesting moments shared between Arctor and his girlfriend, Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder). Their relationship revolves around their mutual abuse of Substance D, which doesn't exactly enhance their moments together so much as it leaves them in a perpetually dazed state of awareness. Their conversations are almost as esoteric as those of Barris, Luckman, and Freck, the only difference being a small degree of intimate, meaningful language. One also gets the sense that Arctor is trying to understand Donna as a person, specifically why she's behaving in certain ways. He knows how devastating the effects of Substance D can be, and he fears that maybe she's going too far with her usage. The two show genuine concern for one another, even when they find themselves lost in a conversation about drooping, floating cats.Despite the free flowing course the story takes, everything does come together by the end. ""A Scanner Darkly"" is one of those movies that can cleverly hide behind a hallucinogenic facade in order to convey a serious message. If you're considering seeing this movie, you have to be willing to get jerked around somewhat, especially when it comes to your expectations for solid characterizations and straightforward storytelling. I think I knew all along that I'd find this film confusing; the ads made it perfectly clear that this was a very unconventional project. But in the end, I didn't really mind; the story takes on the form of a seriously warped puzzle, and I welcomed the opportunity to put the pieces together and figure things out for myself.Let me end by quoting the tagline from Jim Henson's ""Labyrinth"": ""A world where everything seems possible, and nothing is as it seems."" I find this to be a fitting way to describe the world of ""A Scanner Darkly."" If you see it with that quote in mind, you just might come away with a better understanding of it.",4,It's High Times for Moviegoers,1153267200,"07 19, 2006",2006,5568,"['Here', 'interesting',

Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report), was adapted skillfully & results in a great movie experience -- especially due to the animation / painting over the original film.I wont ruin the points of the movie -- I will say that the acting was superb by all, as was the script adaptation.  It is not at all hard to follow, as some have said -- just don't leave for 5-10 min and leave it playing - pause it, it's really that simple.I'll admit, when I 1st saw the Trailers, I thought ""what the heck is that movie about, what the heck is that title suppose to mean, and why the heck would they animate live film - it's probably going to be a retarded attempt to cash in on new technology, while screaming - Hey, We're the 1st ones to do this form of media... the movie's terrible, but who cares, we're the 1st, so you have to see it!!""  ----  BOY WAS I WRONG.I didn't realize till after it left the theaters that it was a P.K.D. Novel, and figured, since the Producers weren't ""screaming"" ""see it cause it's unique"" -- they probably did it for a good reason (not just for show) & I should give it a chance.... and I'm here to tell you, you should too.  It's NOT some Stoner movie, it's not even a ""drug movie"".  It's a movie about what the ""War On Drugs"" could (and may) turn into, it's about who's right, and what's enough -- but miles away from what Minority Report was about... it's only set 7 years in the future... but is very relavent to the Political, and Societal climate of today.Anyway - it's not often I take the time to gab about good movies (or music) -- mostly I write (and warn) against Garbage (of which there is much) -- so that should say a lot.... this is a very good movie; and I was Very skeptical even when buying it ---- but extremely glad I did.  I will give 1 warning (since I've referenced his other works):  This is NOT an action movie.  It is a Dark Comedy / Thriller I guess is the best way to describe it.  It's not something you'll want to watch over and over (like when you 1st got Total Recall or Minority Report; and other such movies) but definitely worth getting & watching periodically.Anyone who says anything contrary to what I've said -- just has something against 1 or more of the actors, didn't pay attention to the film (or has ADD), or saw it expecting something totally different - and were just disappointed because of that... which is generally the case for about 1/2 the bad reviews most good (yet sometimes misunderstood) movies get.Thanks, & enjoy the flick!",5,"Brilliantly crafted, from start to finish --- A Must See!",1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,2585,"['Scanner', 'Darkly', 'brilliant', 'film', 'Originally', 'Novel', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Minority', 'Report', 'was', 'adapted', 'skillfully', 'results', 'great', 'movie', 'experience', 'especially', 'due', 'animation', '/', 'painting', 'original', 'film.I', 'wont', 'ruin', 'points', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'was', 'script', 'adaptation', 'not', 'hard', 'follow', 'have', 'said', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', '5-10', 'min', 'leave', 'playing', 'pause', 'really', 'simple.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'when', '1st', 'saw', 'Trailers', 'thought', 'what', 'heck', 'movie', 'what', 'heck', 'title', 'suppose', 'mean', 'why', 'heck', 'would', 'animate', 'live', 'film', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'retarded', 'attempt', 'cash', 'new', 'technology', 'screaming', 'Hey', ""'re"", '1st', 'ones', 'do', 'form', 'media', 'movie', 'terrible', 'who', ""'re"", '1st', 'so', 'have', 'see', 'BOY', 'WAS', 'WRONG.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'till', 'left', 'theaters', 'was', 'P.K.D', 'Novel', 'figured', 'Producers', 'were', ""n't"", 'screaming', 'see', 'cause', 'unique', 'probably', 'did', 'good', 'reason', 'not', 'just', 'show', 'should', 'give', 'chance', ""'m"", 'here', 'tell', 'should', 'too', 'NOT', 'Stoner', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'drug', 'movie', 'movie', 'what', 'War', 'Drugs', 'could', 'may', 'turn', 'who', 'right', 'what', 'enough', 'miles', 'away', 'what', 'Minority', 'Report', 'was', 'only', 'set', '7', 'years', 'future', 'very', 'relavent', 'Political', 'Societal', 'climate', 'today.Anyway', 'not', 'often', 'take', 'time', 'gab', 'about', 'good', 'movies', 'music', 'mostly', 'write', 'warn', 'Garbage', 'much', 'should', 'say', 'lot', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'Very', 'skeptical', 'even', 'when', 'buying', 'extremely', 'glad', 'did', 'will', 'give', '1', 'warning', ""'ve"", 'referenced', 'other', 'works', 'NOT', 'action', 'movie', 'Dark', 'Comedy', '/', 'Thriller', 'guess', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'not', 'something', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'when', '1st', 'got', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Minority', 'Report', 'other', 'such', 'movies', 'definitely', 'getting', 'watching', 'periodically.Anyone', 'who', 'anything', 'contrary', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'just', 'something', '1', 'more', 'actors', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'film', 'ADD', 'saw', 'expecting', 'something', 'totally', 'different', 'were', 'just', 'disappointed', 'generally', 'case', 'about', '1/2', 'bad', 'reviews', 'most', 'good', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'misunderstood', 'movies', 'get.Thanks', 'enjoy', 'flick']",N/A

So we have A Scanner Darkly, directed by Richard Linklater who brought such ""classics"" such as Dazed and Confused or the Jack Black vehicle School of Rock while this film continues a filmmaking tradition of what's called ""rotoscoping"" which I'll get into later. The thing is the film looks great, it's just the actual film underneath isn't.Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves) is a pusher of a drug known as Substance D which is highly addictive and eventually creates extensive brain damage. He's got druggie friends Barris (Robert Downey Jr, the film's bright spot) and Luckman (Woody Harrelson) as well as Bob's girlfriend Donna who's a heroin addict. The rub is that Arctor, a Substance D addict also can't figure out he's also ""Fred"", an undercover narcotics officer who wears a ""scramble suit"" that constantly shifts his appearance to conceal his real identity and makes things worse when he investigates himself.The process of rotoscoping is basically taking the live-action footage and basically coloring it and turning it into something resembling a moving comic book. Forget Sin City, Hellboy or Spider-Man, this is a true ""comic book movie"" that the others wish they could do. Well if the original story was a comic anyway but it's really a cool watch and it gives extra weight to what's essentially a confusing and quite frankly boring story. Not a lot happens (arguments about bike gears, notes on front doors are just mind-numbingly tedious) and when something does happen, it just doesn't have any emotional connection at all.So now we come to the acting of the thing. Reeves, often the butt of debates on his acting ability is quite good here although he still has that ""I'm bored"" voice. And like I said, Downey is quite funny as the rambling paranoid druggie and Harrelson plays that slightly mentally challenged character well and even in animation form, Winona Ryder is just too cute. The others are pretty much non-existant since either they're not important although Rory Cochrane has a pretty big role as a huge Substance D addict but ultimately everyone just fades in the background as we deal with the main 4.I'd recommend the film just to check out the animation style but as for the story, I didn't care for it but try it out anyway, who knows, maybe you'll be one of the few who ""gets"" it.",3,Loses steam unbelievably quickly,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",2007,2499,"['Most', 'times', 'watch', 'movie', 'simply', 'everybody', 'fuss', 'get', 'point', 'where', ""'ll"", 'go', 'nuts', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'seeing', 'movie', 'plate', 'things', 'do', 'have', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'who', 'brought', 'such', 'classics', 'such', 'Dazed', 'Confused', 'Jack', 'Black', 'vehicle', 'School', 'Rock', 'film', 'filmmaking', 'tradition', 'what', 'called', 'rotoscoping', ""'ll"", 'get', 'later', 'thing', 'film', 'great', 'just', 'actual', 'film', 'underneath', ""isn't.Bob"", 'Arctor', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'pusher', 'drug', 'known', 'Substance', 'D', 'highly', 'addictive', 'eventually', 'extensive', 'brain', 'damage', 'got', 'druggie', 'friends', 'Barris', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'film', 'bright', 'spot', 'Luckman', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'as', 'well', 'Bob', 'girlfriend', 'Donna', 'who', 'heroin', 'addict', 'rub', 'Arctor', 'Substance', 'D', 'addict', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'also', 'Fred', 'undercover', 'narcotics', 'officer', 'who', 'scramble', 'suit', 'constantly', 'appearance', 'conceal', 'real', 'identity', 'things', 'worse', 'when', 'himself.The', 'process', 'rotoscoping', 'basically', 'taking', 'live-action', 'footage', 'basically', 'coloring', 'turning', 'something', 'resembling', 'moving', 'comic', 'book', 'Forget', 'Sin', 'City', 'Hellboy', 'Spider-Man', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'others', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'Well', 'original', 'story', 'was', 'comic', 'anyway', 'really', 'cool', 'watch', 'extra', 'weight', 'what', 'essentially', 'confusing', 'quite', 'frankly', 'boring', 'story', 'Not', 'lot', 'arguments', 'bike', 'gears', 'notes', 'front', 'doors', 'are', 'just', 'mind-numbingly', 'tedious', 'when', 'something', 'happen', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'emotional', 'connection', 'all.So', 'now', 'come', 'acting', 'thing', 'Reeves', 'often', 'butt', 'debates', 'acting', 'ability', 'quite', 'good', 'here', 'still', ""'m"", 'bored', 'voice', 'said', 'Downey', 'quite', 'funny', 'rambling', 'paranoid', 'druggie', 'Harrelson', 'slightly', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'character', 'well', 'even', 'animation', 'form', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'others', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'non-existant', ""'re"", 'not', 'important', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'pretty', 'big', 'role', 'huge', 'Substance', 'D', 'addict', 'ultimately', 'everyone', 'just', 'fades', 'background', 'deal', 'main', '4.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'animation', 'style', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'try', 'out', 'anyway', 'who', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'one', 'few', 'who']",N/A

And like the Sixth Sense - and more recently, Volver - this is a film that you almost have to see twice to truly get all there is to extract from it, due to the fact that what is revealed late in the movie invests what happened earlier with an extra meaning that you most likely could not have grasped when it initially occurred.But don't get me wrong: I enjoyed it plenty the first time through as well.  A Scanner Darkly is a very human sci-fi saga that is all about layers: surveillance representing self-consciousness and self-awareness, and a story about imposters impersonating imposters.  Even the very filming technique - laying animation upon a reality already filmed (known as ""rotoscoping"") - speaks to the layers that, ironically, are the core of this thoughtful (and oftentimes funny) film.Woody Harrelson, Rory Cochrane, and Robert Downey Jr. are all at the top of their games, working well within the live-action/animation combination.  Keanu Reeves rises above his usual ""Johnny Catatonic"" level of acting to convey at least some semblance of emotion.  And Winona Ryder gives her best performance of this millenium (granted, that's not saying a whole heck of a lot, but hey - ya gotta start somewhere).I feel the animated technique really adds to the story, too, since it's also about blurring the lines between reality and hallucination/illusion, between sobriety and intoxication.  And though I myself am not much of a drug user, this filming technique helped me immerse myself in and experience more fully the world of addiction depicted onscreen.  My 4-star rating is actually an average: 3.5 for the first viewing, and 4.5 for the second.As for the commentary track... I could listen to Richard Linklater talk forever (and, through his films, I kind of get to do just that!) - loved his insights and anecdotes. And Isa Hackett Dick, Phillip K Dick's daughter, has many interesting things to say about the relationship between this movie's storyline and her father's (and her) own life. It's also entertaining to hear PKD scholar Jonathan Lethem totally school faux-scholar Keanu Reeves when it comes to thoughtful analysis. It's hilarious hearing Keanu trying hard to sound all erudite and philosphical, while Lethem just does it effortlessly.",4,Is Your Reality Missing A Few Gears?,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",2007,2439,"['A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'might', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'initially', 'encourage', 'stick', 'are', 'great', 'rewards', 'lurking', 'end', 'film', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'more', 'recently', 'Volver', 'film', 'almost', 'have', 'see', 'twice', 'truly', 'get', 'extract', 'due', 'fact', 'what', 'revealed', 'late', 'movie', 'what', 'happened', 'earlier', 'extra', 'meaning', 'most', 'likely', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'grasped', 'when', 'initially', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'very', 'human', 'sci-fi', 'saga', 'layers', 'surveillance', 'representing', 'self-consciousness', 'self-awareness', 'story', 'imposters', 'impersonating', 'imposters', 'Even', 'very', 'filming', 'technique', 'laying', 'animation', 'reality', 'already', 'filmed', 'known', 'rotoscoping', 'speaks', 'layers', 'ironically', 'are', 'core', 'thoughtful', 'oftentimes', 'funny', 'film.Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'are', 'top', 'games', 'working', 'well', 'live-action/animation', 'combination', 'Keanu', 'rises', 'usual', 'Johnny', 'Catatonic', 'level', 'acting', 'convey', 'least', 'semblance', 'emotion', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'best', 'performance', 'millenium', 'granted', 'not', 'saying', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'hey', 'ya', 'got', 'ta', 'start', 'somewhere', '.I', 'feel', 'animated', 'technique', 'really', 'story', 'too', 'also', 'about', 'blurring', 'lines', 'reality', 'hallucination/illusion', 'sobriety', 'intoxication', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'drug', 'user', 'filming', 'technique', 'helped', 'immerse', 'experience', 'more', 'fully', 'world', 'addiction', 'depicted', 'onscreen', '4-star', 'rating', 'actually', 'average', '3.5', 'first', 'viewing', '4.5', 'second.As', 'commentary', 'track', 'could', 'listen', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'talk', 'forever', 'films', 'kind', 'get', 'do', 'just', 'loved', 'insights', 'anecdotes', 'Isa', 'Hackett', 'Dick', 'Phillip', 'K', 'Dick', 'daughter', 'many', 'interesting', 'things', 'say', 'relationship', 'movie', 'storyline', 'father', 'own', 'life', 'also', 'entertaining', 'hear', 'PKD', 'scholar', 'Jonathan', 'Lethem', 'totally', 'school', 'faux-scholar', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'when', 'thoughtful', 'analysis', 'hilarious', 'hearing', 'Keanu', 'trying', 'hard', 'sound', 'erudite', 'philosphical', 'Lethem', 'just', 'effortlessly']",N/A

(But my favorite PKD work is the short story The Exit Door Opens In...) This movie was freaking awesome. I loved the way they animated it and felt this cast did a great job, even bombed out Keanu.This DVD was another in the long line of Hollywood snow jobs. PKD has a huge fan base and stoners love cartoons, so I don't see why they did this.There are no animated menus what so ever. This is a minor thing since no one really camps on the menu anyway, but it is the first thing you see--after the score of previews--and shows the makers really care about the disc. I have made better DVDs on my laptop with Nero.For some reason every time I play this thing it turns on the subtitles. I'm not sure if this is my player (Sony) or the disc, but no other DVD I own does this.The special features are pathetic. There are two making of features, commentaries, and 1 trailer. There could have been so much more. During one of the making of features a cast member flips through a scene by scene story board script. During the animation making of they show you how every character every scene had a detailed design sheet. On the Scanner Myspace page there are scores of trailers, interviews, a press conference from Cannes, but only the lame first run trailer was included. They designed an amazing interactive web site with great animations they could have robbed from as well.Basically all you get is a few buttons to play the movie and a poor selection of special features. If they do not release a special edition I will be extremely pissed.All you geniuses who rate movies before the DVD is released are partly to blame for this.

The visuals were very different and unique and all around were quite stunning.In the not-too-distant future, Robert Arctor (Keanu Reeves) is working undercover to bust a purported drug ring; the drug in question is substance D, a highly addictive substance that scrambles the brains of its users. Arctor is so far undercover, in fact, that he begins using the drug, and becomes more paranoid as the reasons for his mission become clearer. The film was adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick, and it contains many of the themes of his other works: fear of Big Brother, a totalitarian future, and technologies that make life more restrictive.As with ""Waking Life,"" the filmmakers shot the actors on video, and then animated their likenesses in a way that creates a dreamlike hyper-reality. The technique is right for the material; the additional veneer heightens the features of such recognizable faces as Reeves, Winona Ryder, Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson, and it contributes to the film's surreal air.

1028824,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B000JMK6LW,D. Hartley,"[16, 18]","Richard Linklater entered the sci-fi arena in 2006 with his adaptation of the late Phillip K. Dick's semi-autobiographical novel ""A Scanner Darkly"". Set in a not-so-distant future L.A., the story injects themes of existential dilemma, drug-fueled paranoia and Orwellian government surveillance (hmm, that's timely) into what is otherwise a fairly standard undercover-cop-who's-gone-too-deep yarn.Keanu Reeves stars as a dazed and confused narc who has become helplessly addicted to the mind-altering drug that he has been assigned to eradicate (""substance D""). Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and the perpetually dazed Linklater alumni Rory Cochrane are his fellow D-heads who may not exactly be whom they appear to be on the surface.Adding to the mood of hallucinatory psychosis is Linklater's controversial use of rotoscoping (as per his underrated Waking Life). The rotoscoping technique does present challenges to the actors; Downey, with his Chaplinesque knack for physical expression, pulls it off best, while the more inert performers like Reeves and Ryder are akin to oil paintings.Linklater's script keeps fairly close to its source material-particularly in relation to the more cerebral elements(Linklater's propensity for lots of talk and little action may be a turn-off for those expecting another Minority Report). Depending on what you bring with you, the film is a) a cautionary tale about addiction, b)a warning about encroaching technocracy, c) an indictment on the government's ""war"" on drugs, d) a really cool flick to watch while stoned, e) the longest 99 minutes of your life or f) all of the above.",3,Dick flick clicks (sort of),1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1637,"['Richard', 'Linklater', 'entered', 'sci-fi', 'arena', '2006', 'adaptation', 'late', 'Phillip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Set', 'not-so-distant', 'future', 'L.A.', 'story', 'themes', 'existential', 'dilemma', 'drug-fueled', 'paranoia', 'Orwellian', 'government', 'surveillance', 'hmm', 'timely', 'what', 'otherwise', 'fairly', 'standard', ""undercover-cop-who's-gone-too-deep"", 'yarn.Keanu', 'stars', 'dazed', 'confused', 'narc', 'who', 'become', 'helplessly', 'addicted', 'mind-altering', 'drug', 'been', 'assigned', 'eradicate', 'substance', 'D', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'perpetually', 'dazed', 'Linklater', 'alumni', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'are', 'fellow', 'D-heads', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'exactly', 'be', 'whom', 'appear', 'be', 'surface.Adding', 'mood', 'hallucinatory', 'psychosis', 'Linklater', 'controversial', 'use', 'rotoscoping', 'underrated', 'Waking', 'Life', 'rotoscoping', 'technique', 'present', 'challenges', 'actors', 'Downey', 'Chaplinesque', 'knack', 'physical', 'expression', 'off', 'best', 'more', 'inert', 'performers', 'Reeves', 'Ryder', 'are', 'akin', 'oil', 'paintings.Linklater', 'script', 'keeps', 'fairly', 'close', 'source', 'material-particularly', 'relation', 'more', 'cerebral', 'elements', 'Linklater', 'propensity', 'lots', 'talk', 'little', 'action', 'may', 'be', 'turn-off', 'expecting', 'Minority', 'Report', 'Depending', 'what', 'bring', 'film', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'addiction', 'b', 'warning', 'encroaching', 'technocracy', 'c', 'indictment', 'government', 'war', 'drugs', 'd', 'really', 'cool', 'flick', 'watch', 'stoned', 'e', 'longest', '99', 'minutes', 'life', 'f', 'above']",N/A
1028825,A3DDSAGWD0UN9H,B000JMK6LW,Discophage,"[0, 0]","Back when I read Sci-Fi, some decades ago, I had skipped Dick's ""A Scanner Darkly"", because his later novels had a reputation of being incoherent and not as imaginative as his recognized and unrecognized masterpieces, Ubik, The Penultimate Truth, Dr Bloodmoney, The Zap Gun, The Simulacra, the Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Time Out-of-Joint (I didn't think back then that The Man in the High-Castle was such a masterpiece, but that's personal). And then it was too late, I had moved on to other things. I even skipped on Linklater's cinematographic adaptation when it came out in 2006, contributing to the film's box-office failure I'm afraid. In fact, I wasn't even aware of the film, and hardly had a notion of Linklater's existence. It is only because, on the occasion of the remake of Total Recall, a few articles were published about Phil K. Dick and films that this one came to my attention, and serendipitously my local library had the DVD.It's a great film, I loved it. I knew so little about it that when I took the DVD it wasn't clear at all to me whether it was an animated film or a ""real"" motion picture. So, it's both, real pictures subjected to whichever ""rotoscopic"" effect or whatever it is. The result is great, not only because it elegantly solves some of the ""special-effect"" challenges of the movie, like the ""scramble suits"" that blur the identity of those who don them - great Dickian idea, and great cinematographic realization - but also because it gives an eerie texture to the image and ""de-realizes"" it, not animated film, not motion picture but a strange ""in-between"" reality - exactly what the film is about.The lead reviewer is absolutely right: not having read the book, it was not clear to me that narc agent ""Fred"" is not aware that he's the same person as the Bob Arctor which he is instructed to spy upon, and it is only reading the comments here and the Wikipedia entry that I understood. I'm not sure Linklater meant it to be clear, because he shows Arctor's face under the scramble suit supposed to make him look like Fred, and it is as if the director deliberately wanted to maintain an ambiguity here as to what Fred/Arctor knows and thinks (his superiors are supposed NOT to know who Fred really is under the scramble suit, only that he is an acquaintance of Bob Arctor and the junkies who dwell in his house), and that too, that very ambiguity, appeared to me as a genuine Dickian touch, Arctor playing the double agent and the spectator never being entirely clear about his motives (""I mustn't let them know that I am in fact Arctor spying on Arctor"" - it opens a labyrinth of possibilities, is he a ""bad guy"" infiltrated in the Narcotics bureau, is he a ""straight"" Narcotics agent dangerously walking on a high-wire, is he both?).Other than that, I found the film a great adaptation of the Dickian universe and spirit, the best I've seen so far, precisely because it doesn't try for a second to be the big action blockbuster like Total Recall or Blade Runner. Dick's novels, Dick's universe and Dick's spirit are not about ""action"" and staging an explosion every three minutes. What people usually focus on is that they are about ""reality is not what you think it is"", and sure there is that, but more fundamentally they are about characters and situations. What makes his novels and universe so unique and endearing are, naturally, the twists, the unexpected denouements by which the reader (and protagonists) realize that reality was not what they thought, and by which we and they realize that the powers that govern us are only simulacra, make-believes. But before and beyond that and more fundamentally, what his novels are ""about"" are the oddball characters and situations he stages throughout: his refrigerator threatening to sue Joe Chip in Ubik, Ragle Gumm making a living from playing in the local newspaper's riddle competition (Time Out-of-Joint), Lars Powderdry bringing back from trance those plans for lethal weapons that simply do not work (The Zap Gun), Richard Kongrosian believing his body odor is lethal and that his organs are spilling out of him (The Simulacra). I've read all this some three decades ago, but it still sticks in memory.The band of junkies depicted in Linklater's film is exactly that. They don't fall over cliffs, throw grenades, escape fifty lethal wounds as Arnold would: they talk, they scream, they rant, they make faces, they get all wound up into their own paranoid constructions, and it is hilarious. One of the funniest scenes is when his table radio instructs Charles Freck (Rory Chochrane) to commit suicide. I don't know how it is in the novel, but among the DVD's bonuses there is an audio excerpt of Dick reading that very passage, and it seems to be only descriptive: having the table radio emit the text and appear to be instructing Freck what to do must be Linklater's invention, and it's a great touch. But everything is hilarious and the two other actors impersonating Arctor's (Actor???) flat-mates (Robert Downey Jr as James Barris and Woody Harrelson as Ernie Luckman) are fab. Among the bonuses there is a full version of the film with the on-going commentaries of Linklater, Reaves, Philip K. Dick's daughter Isa Hackett and a couple of others, and Linklater mentions a few scenes ""that could have easily been cut out of the movie, digressive, humorous"" and that don't ""advance the story"", which he had to fight for, saying that cutting them would be ""missing the essence"" - but he doesn't explain more, and doesn't even seem clear as to why they were the essence. But of course they are. Sure, the film is about its ""plot"", substance D and how it jinxes the characters' perception of reality, and trying to track down the Big Corporation that secretly manufactures it. But, more fundamentally, more ""essentially"", the film is about this community of paranoid junkies that was, as Isa Dick Hackett confirms, Philip K. Dick's very world, and how they see confirmation in every indicent of their paranoid fears, and how they try to make twisted sense of this senseless world. This is no sci-fi, in many ways the ""plot"" is just a pretext: this is a hilarious situational comedy about paranoia.So this is my first encounter with Linklater, and it shouldn't be the last. Reading his bio I feel a strange attraction. It's a generational and geographical thing: we were born in the same city, just a few days apart. In fact, I suspect we were born in the same hospital, and I bet he's circumcised too. In fact, I'm now convinced our two cradles were switched, and that I am Richard Linklater, and he is Discophage, writing this review right now. And look, that name: Link Later. Surely that's one Philip K. Dick made up. I must really get off those pills.",5,time to get off those pills,1346630400,"09 3, 2012",2012,6761,"['Back', 'when', 'read', 'Sci-Fi', 'decades', 'had', 'skipped', 'Dick', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly',

1028834,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000JMK6LW,General Zombie,"[1, 2]","Hmm, this one has gotten itself a lot of longer reviews, so I'll try and trim it down a bit.  I don't feel like structuring it too much, so here we go.-Here's a basic plot summary:  In the late 2010's, Bob Arctor is a burnt-out undercover narcotics officer fighting against the Substance D epidemic that's caught some 1/5 of the populace, Bob included.  For the most part he just lives the life of the addict that he is, hanging around his house with his friends, the paranoid Barris, the laidback Luckman and the plain twitchy and freaked out Freck, and talking endlessly while at other times trying to come onto the mysterious Donna, his drug-dealer and quasi-girlfriend.  Arctor's lifestyle is starting to take its toll, and Artor's mind begins to crack (both metaphorically and literally) under the strain of his occupation.-That probably doesn't sound like much of a plot summary, and you're right, it isn't, and that's the main concern I have with the film.  I'd read the novel and thought it was pretty good, but I couldn't see any real way to shape it into a coherent plot for a 90 minute film.  Turns out Linklater didn't even really try.  The novel itself is a bunch of ideas and episodes and plot threads with no real narrative drive.  This works okay, if not ideally, in a novel, but it's not entirely appropriate for a film.  Thus, the film seems pretty meandering and formless up until the major third act revelation, after which the film is pretty much over.  That said, I don't think any of it could be called boring, but it's not exactly enthralling either.  Just kinda interesting and occasionally a bit funny.  Overall, the film is overwhelmingly faithful to the book.  Some things are cut and others crompressed, but precious little material in the film is not culled from the novel in some way or another.  The few additions largely come in some attempts to make the film relevant to modern politics, which I think are fairly pointless.  The concerns about government power, secrecy and unlimited surveillance come through clearly enough in the source material, so the heavy-handed modernizing tactics are totally unnecessary.-I like the rotoscoping quite a lot.  I was kind of opposed to the method when I first saw it, but it's definitely grown on me.  For the most part, it doesn't seem to serve any real particular purpose in the film, apart from creating a general sense of unworldliness. (Which is pretty appropriate, I suppose.)-Lotsa people have whined about the acting, but I think it's fine.  Reeves uses his standard dull, low-key delivery, but I think that's pretty much how the character should be done.  Downey Jr. does his usual twitchy nut routine and Harrelson is the good-natured goofball once again, but this is the kinda thing they're supposed to play, and they do it well.  The film consists primarily of the main characters sitting around and talking, so how much you enjoy it will likely center around how entertaining you find their drugged out banter.  What can I say, I liked it.  They verge on caricatures at times, (especially Cochrane as Freck, who's pretty much a human cartoon) but they're still fun to watch, anyway.  The heart of the film, thematically speaking, is found in the handful of monologues that are thrown in here and there, mostly lifted from the novel, and I think they work quite nicely.-Though the first 2/3 of the film are fairly unsubstantiative, when things really start to get dark in the final act the film proves to be suprisingly affecting.  It's pretty bleak, and I found I was more involved with Arctor than I'd thought.Geez, I haven't got much to say.  Worth a look if you enjoyed the novel, though I dunno how others will react to it.  I thought it was pretty decent, anyway.",4,"3.5.

This movie however can best be summed up with Keanu's first line of dialogue in it: ""This is terrible.""I was never a particularly big fan of the novel, but the characters in it were interesting and complex enough that you wanted to find out what happened to them. Their paranoia and psychosis was portrayed realistically without insulting the reader's intelligence. Linklater however is clearly too incompetent as a director to achieve this same sort of mood in a film regardless of its effects budget (or perhaps too stupid to realize it was ever there in the first place), so he opted to simply throw all the original subtext away in favor of a bunch of kooky, shifty-eyed junkies scratching themselves while spouting off some wannabe Kevin Smith style conspiracy theories for our amusement.I have a feeling he might have tried to downplay the original plotline in order to avoid comparisons to the identity crisis presented in ""Fight Club"", but in so doing he also tossed out all of the ""deeper meaning"" (and I use the term loosely as the book really isn't particularly deep), turning a once halfway decent story into nothing more than an overly preachy anti-war-on-drugs vignette that's every bit as difficult to sit through as the anti-drug propaganda it complains about incessantly. By the time the movie gets to the story's conclusion where Dick's philosophical meanderings are absolutely unavoidable, they feel incredibly forced, as though tacked on at the last minute. The actors clearly have no idea why they're reading any of those lines about death and god and salvation, and the audience doesn't either since Linklater was too busy trying to impress his college stoner friends with sophomoric drivel to actually integrate any of it into the story. I can think of at least six PKD books that should have been made into movies before this one, but having seen the final product, I can say I'm very glad Linklater chose to butcher this one instead.If you think sitting around and saying things like ""Yeah man you know those cops are all like totally high"" makes you a radical social activist whose going to amount to a hill of beans someday, then you'll probably think this is the greatest film ever made.

Dick's 1997 sci-fi novel A Scanner Darkly, a cautionary tale about drug addiction and the all-too-real ""War on Drugs.""This film's predecessors were big-budget action movies such as Minority Report (2002), Blade Runner (1982) and Total Recall (1990)--the latter two based, respectively, on Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and his short story ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale."" By contrast, A Scanner Darkly is an independent production with more intimate dialogue, locales, and situations, as well as a polished ensemble cast.Set in Orange County, California, seven years in the future, the plot revolves around Keanu Reeves's character, Agent Fred, a local narcotics officer. He's assigned to gain the confidence of a passel of burnouts in order to find the source for the highly addictive ""Substance D,"" which is ravaging the brains of about twenty percent of the population. As Robert Downey Jr.'s character puts it, ""Either you're on it, or you haven't tried it.""Inside police headquarters, Agent Fred dons a holographic ""scramble suit,"" an undulating, visage-changing second skin that protects his anonymity. Out on the streets, he uses the suit to take on his workaday persona, Bob Arctor, a loser who has become an addict in order to avoid detection by the stoner housemates whom he is investigating. Although critics savage Keanu Reeves's acting, you can't deny that he has striking screen presence, something that often eludes more talented thespians. Here he gives one of his more convincing performances--ironically, by playing someone who's heavily sedated most of the time.Anyone who's ever tried drugs will instantly recognize the bizarre logic of doper group dynamics. Woody Harrelson plays Ernie Luckman, a mind-expanding hippie who relates to everyday life through Beatles lyrics; Winona Ryder is Bob's attractive girlfriend Donna, sexually frigid because her vascular system is constantly constricted by cocaine; Robert Downey, Jr. gives a nuanced performance as Jim Barris, a manipulative Iago who mouths pseudo-scientific doubletalk; and Rory Cochrane's paranoiac Charles Freck suffers harrowing hallucinations of aphids swarming over his body--images that make Ray Milland's DTs in The Lost Weekend seem like the paragon of sobriety.Identity, reality, and hallucinations tumble over one another in a visual kaleidoscope, bits of which undoubtedly originated in the novelist's own experiences with drug addiction and suicide attempts. In the novel, Freck strategically places a copy of The Fountainhead near his body prior to a suicide attempt in order to ""prove he had been a misunderstood superman rejected by the masses and so, in a sense, murdered by their scorn."" A version of this scene survives in the film. This shouldn't be perceived as a tribute to Ayn Rand, though: Dick didn't sympathize in the least with her vision of a society of heroic, productive achievers. In a 1978 interview he commented, ""I'm with the little man. I wouldn't be with the `superman' characters for all the money in the world. You know, the characters in Ayn Rand and [Robert] Heinlein who have such a contempt for everybody. Because one day that little man is gonna rise up and punch the superman out and I want to be there when it happens.""Well, in this tale he has certainly given us little men aplenty.A Scanner Darkly does present a vaguely libertarian argument about the threats to civil liberties from criminalizing drug use, and envisages a future in which the government exploits the War On Terror as a pretext to employ electronic surveillance of homes and public places in order to nab users and dealers. However, I doubt that this film's relentlessly bleak portrait of drug addiction will win it many fans from among those single-issue libertarians who navely believe that legalization will cure a host of social ills. Apart from a couple of outrageous pothead scenes worthy of an old Cheech and Chong flick, the movie captures starkly the vicious circles in which addicts move--a world where the main focus is scoring the next fix, and the ultimate result is loss of identity in slavish drug dependency.Yet, while the movie's moral center remains intact, Linklater's directorial approach doesn't exactly make for the most riveting cinema. To re-create for the viewer the drug addict's ambiguous, constantly shifting state of mind, visual effects director Richard Gordoa filmed in the animation process of Rotoscoping--a trippy, graphically seductive imaging technique that layers painted animation over actual footage of the actors. Although many movies pair dramatic images with a largely nonsensical plots--I think of David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001)--I felt that without the Rotoscoping, A Scanner Darkly would be just as mundane as its aimless subjects.That visual effect just doesn't elevate its fairly threadbare story line, and the film never fully overcomes its gimmicky execution. While the surprise ending provides a satisfying payoff, having to sit through almost two lumbering hours to arrive at the climactic plot twist (as with Bryan Singer's modern noir, The Usual Suspects) proved taxing. Linklater could learn a thing or two from Alfred Hitchcock's masterful examples of how to build suspense throughout a film until it reaches fever pitch, and then unleashing the final shock.Although A Scanner Darkly serves up a morsel or two of food for thought, what is up on the screen won't compete with the buttered popcorn in your lap. Unless you wash it down with your drug of choice.",3,"Just Say ""Maybe""",1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,5678,"['Director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'Slackers', 'School', 'Rock', 'brought', 'screen',

However, what I do know, is that fans of Linklater's taking a conventional (or somewhat conventional/easy plot) and putting something INTO the screen. A lot of films one sees now, you see the preview and the premise of the film and your intrigued by what it is about. However, when you get to the theater, of course, the film does a poor job at what surrounds the story and theme. Linklater is not a plot fanatic....most of his films involves highly energetic, intellectual conversation that sometimes borders on nonsense (which should be expected from the fact that they are all on drugs). One person mentioned that the serious overtone of drug use is not protrayed well, but by the end of the film i felt the pain and the cyclical nature of drug use. What I mean is that, though the film is often times filled with humor, it is a humor one pities and laughs because it makes them uncomfortable that someone could possibly be seeing these things/feeling these things/saying these things. However, how could Linklater (or indeed, Dick) should the hindsight of the drug use throughout the entire film...it would be an entirely different film. Any film about drugs always has the era where the drug use is euphoric and the users are having a good old time. It is exactly this transition from ""stoner comedy"" to ""drama"" that jerks the viewer around a bit and realizes that all these things that the former attitude was false if it is compared to the everyday reality of existence. Tragedy in this film is chased with a heavy glass fo comedy in order to satirize both the war on drugs and the drug users themselves. Ultimately, it is not a happy ending--how can drugs and addiction have a happy ending? The film leaves you with a sorrowful overtone for the all the characters that are destroying themselves with drugs.Also, and again, this is just an opinion, I liked the random shifts in how the story was portrayed. We got that ""voice over"" part that was most likely an internal monologue written by Dick that Linklater really wanted to put in, but he did not want to go strictly ""voice over"" technique because it is an overused technique in film.I""m not saying that I think this film is the best film for everyone and anyone. I loved this film, but of course it isn't a universal classic. However, I'm sure that this film will because a cult classic among people who love interesting movies. Some films just hit you and your just like ""wow, that was a great movie, I could tell you why, but it will pretty much take as long as the film was."" A film that can be discussed on many levels, A Scanner Darkly does not dissapoint.Note: though I do believe that Keanu Reeves cannot really express too much emotion and whatnot...I do believe that this was good for the movie. The character doesn't seem to have much left in him...he looks very out of it.

I rented this movie simply because I had seen the previews and thought it looked like a good Sci-Fi thriller with some awesome animation. But as far as it being a Sci-Fi thriller like the preview had made it look to be....it was not. Like my title says, this movie is not for everyone. It is a slow-paced movie with a mashed-up story line that I found hard to follow. However...I enjoyed it. I watched Scanner late at night, lying on the couch, feet propped up, feeling slightly drowsy, and this movie was very relaxing for me to watch. The animated technology that was done on this film is amazing. It looks like you are watching a watercolor painting in motion. The painted liquid like look of the movie gives a kind of trippy feeling which is ironic because the film is about an undercover cop (Keanu) who gets hooked on a drug called Substance D which gives it's users hallucinations. The acting was also fun to watch. I thought that the characters played by Robert Downey Jr, Woody Harrelson, and Rory Cochrane were great as well as Keanu Reeves. Plus anything with Wynona Ryder in it is enough to stir my interest even if she's painted/animated.

The look of this film is interesting and the special effects added to the animation is pretty cool..  The approach to this movie is more of a satire type dark comedy and has little suspense.  I felt that the story would have been better served if it was darker and a bit more suspenseful or eerier even.

Dick, follows a drug agent named ""Fred"" whose brain is literally split, like Siamese twins, by a psychedelic drug known as Substance D (for Death). Through this disruption we see the symbiotic relationship between the cops and criminals as Fred, who's identity is obscured by a ""scramble suit,"" does electronic surveillance on himself as a drug dealer named Bob Arctor.This is a very faithful adaptation to Dick's novel, one of the best I've read on drug abuse and without a doubt, the most creative on the subject. Like Waking Life, Linklater chose to animate this film in that floating style of his that is essentially rotoscoping or tracing over live action elements and combining them with composite imagery. The effect of this style decision pays off by augmenting the drug induced reality of the world in which this story takes place. An example of this is when an addict attempts to O.D. on psychedelics but instead winds up face to face with a weird-looking creature from another dimension.This is one of those sci fi films that snuck under the radar, mostly because of the fact that it is an animated film aimed at adults. The addition of Robert Downey Jr. as one of the paranoid addicts (Barris)who himself was a drug user was probably not a coincidence. Keanu Reeves is convincingly ""dirty"" and tacky-looking as drug dealer and user Bob Arctor. Woody Harrelson is also grimy as Luckman, Reeve's long-haired roommate in this film.Scanners is one of those ""you'll either like it, or you won't"" films. Not that it's all that hard or graphic, it's the way it's presented. I try to tell people I know about this movie and they really want to see it, then once they discover that it's animated, they're turned off like that.

1028861,A2AVD56NK41OPE,B000JMK6LW,Jonathan Stover,"[4, 4]","Adapter/director Richard Linklater achieved at least three remarkable things with A Scanner Darkly: he created the most faithful movie adaptation of a Philip K. Dick novel or short story ever; he created an outstanding science-fiction film; and he maximized the limited acting ability of Keanu Reeves by casting Reeves as a burnt-out case in the midst of a drug-fueled mental breakdown.Reeves plays Bob Arctor, a near-future California undercover government narc charged by his superiors with helping win the war against Substance D, a highly addictive illegal substance that rapidly causes irreversible brain damage in those addicted to it, partially by severing the connection between an addict's left and right brain hemispheres.Arctor is deep undercover, sharing a house with two other addicts and buying Substance D from a third in increasingly difficult-to-supply mass quantities in the hopes of moving up the supply chain. The government knows what the main ingredient of Substance D derives from -- a small, blue-flowered plant -- but it doesn't know who is growing it, refining it, and putting it on the street.Dick based much of A Scanner Darkly on his own drug experiences of the 1960's and 1970's, experiences which saw him committed to a mental asylum for a time, and experiences which caused him to interact with a large number of doomed and mostly doomed addicts. Indeed, the movie appends a portion of the novel's afterword to the end of the movie -- a roll call of the dead and damaged.The hyper-colourful, rotoscoped animation Linklater uses here (he first used it in Waking Life) suits the material and the tone of that material -- the movie looks like a fever dream, a pulsating nightmare in which nothing is stable. All the principals deliver outstanding performances, including Reeves, and perhaps most notably Robert Downey Jr., who presents us with a jittery speed freak (Substance D appears to be at least partially an amphetamine) over-bursting with his own paranoid delusions and fantasies.The title is a play on the Biblical phrase 'Through a glass, darkly': there are scanners in this movie, but they aren't the Cronenberg variety.",5,Feverish,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,2160,"['Adapter/director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'achieved', 'least', 'three', 'remarkable', 'things', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'created', 'most', 'faithful', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'novel', 'short', 'story', 'ever', 'created', 'outstanding', 'science-fiction', 'film', 'maximized', 'limited', 'acting', 'ability', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'casting', 'Reeves', 'burnt-out', 'case', 'midst', 'drug-fueled', 'mental', 'breakdown.Reeves', 'plays', 'Bob', 'Arctor', 'near-future', 'California', 'undercover', 'government', 'narc', 'charged', 'superiors', 'helping', 'win', 'war', 'Substance', 'D', 'highly', 'addictive', 'illegal', 'substance', 'rapidly', 'irreversible', 'brain', 'damage', 'addicted', 'partially', 'severing', 'connection', 'addict', 'left', 'right', 'brain', 'hemispheres.Arctor', 'deep', 'undercover', 'sharing', 'house', 'two', 'other', 'addicts', 'buying', 'Substance', 'D', 'third', 'increasingly', 'difficult-to-supply', 'mass', 'quantities', 'hopes', 'moving', 'up', 'supply', 'chain', 'government', 'what', 'main', 'ingredient', 'Substance', 'D', 'small', 'blue-flowered', 'plant', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'growing', 'refining', 'putting', 'street.Dick', 'based', 'much', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'own', 'drug', 'experiences', '1960', '1970', 'saw', 'committed', 'mental', 'asylum', 'time', 'experiences', 'caused', 'interact', 'large', 'number', 'doomed', 'mostly', 'doomed', 'addicts', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'portion', 'novel', 'afterword', 'end', 'movie', 'roll', 'call', 'dead', 'damaged.The', 'hyper-colourful', 'rotoscoped', 'animation', 'Linklater', 'here', 'first', 'used', 'Waking', 'Life', 'suits', 'material', 'tone', 'material', 'movie', 'fever', 'dream', 'pulsating', 'nightmare', 'nothing', 'stable', 'principals', 'deliver', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'including', 'Reeves', 'perhaps', 'most', 'notably', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'jittery', 'speed', 'freak', 'Substance', 'D', 'be', 'least', 'partially', 'amphetamine', 'over-bursting', 'own', 'paranoid', 'delusions', 'fantasies.The', 'title', 'play', 'Biblical', 'phrase', 'glass', 'darkly', 'are', 'scanners', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'Cronenberg', 'variety']",N/A
1028862,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000JMK6LW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[4, 5]","""A Scanner Darkly"" is, without a doubt, the most fascinating film I've seen in 2006. It is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, the writer behind Minority Report. It wasn't until watching the film that I realized how little the previews reveal about it. The previews take advantage of its unique animation and big-name stars to sell the film, it tells very little about the story. When I started watching it, I expected a science-fiction film in the vein of Minority Report or Paycheck. Having said that, I'm going to tell you, bluntly, just what this film is. ""A Scanner Darkly"" is a drug movie. The only thing that separates it from other drug movies is the animation and the fact that the movie actually (sort of) has a plot. The film belongs in the same category as movies like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" and ""Spun."" Not good, since the film is being put in the same category as movies like ""Minority Report"" and ""The Matrix."" Chances are; if you don't like movies like ""Spun"" than you won't like ""A Scanner Darkly."" The movie takes place in the ""near future"" where 20% of the nation is addicted to Substance D, a drug that produces hallucinations and split personalities. Keanu Reeves plays an Orange Country cop, working undercover, named Fred who is trying to take down Bob Arctor, a user/dealer of this drug. Problem is, Fred is Bob. His fellow officers aren't aware of this because undercover agents, when in the office, wear a special suit which scrambles their voice pattern and, most importantly, the way they look. Between speaking to his superiors and viewing hidden camera footage that is in HIS HOUSE, Fred returns to the house and becomes Bob. As Bob, he drops D with is roommates James Barris (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson) at which point the men hallucinate and spew forth their half-baked conspiracy theories. The movie does have a plot, although it kind of appears in fragments. Some parts of the movie are, merely, scenes of Bob, Barris, and Ernie hallucinating and freaking out. Sometimes with Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane), who is under the impression that little green bugs are crawling all over his body. And then there's Donna Hawthorne (Winona Ryder, who looks hot even when animated), Bob's girlfriend and a cokehead, who may play a bigger part in what's going on than we're lead to believe. This movie got mixed reviews upon its release and I now see why. The critics expecting a sci-fi film found themselves disappointed. The critics that did give this a good review, most likely, saw the film with an open mind. It's biggest fans are going to be people who liked/loved the movies I mentioned above. The fact remains, however, that there's no other film like ""A Scanner Darkly."" The animation (which, I read, is a painstaking process that is created frame-by-frame) is a wonder to behold. I could not take my eyes off of the screen and I hope there are more movies with this animation in the future. The acting is really good and it seems like the actors were really having fun. Keanu Reeves seems more alive in this film than he does in many other films and Winona Ryder sparkles, while also showing more skin than she has in any other movie (although, I read, that her nudity was animated over her shirt). But it is Downey and Harrelson who steal the show. Their hilarious, over-the-top, campy, and (somewhat) realistic portrayals of the two drug addicts are absolutely hilarious. Richard Linklater (director of ""Dazed & Confused"") has a thought-provoking script and a steady hand in the directing category. The film shows true directorial brilliance. This is a movie that you're either going to love or hate. You'll either get it or you won't.

Dawson ""Kakrine""","[3, 4]","The best advice I can give you before watching this movie is to clear your mind of any ideas of what you might think 'A Scanner Darkly' is about, because more than likely your going to get lost. The movie was filmed just like any other movie would have been, and than dubbed over with animation making the film look like a comic book come to life.Keanu Reeves brilliantly plays three characters in this film. First you come to know him as Fred, an undercover agent who is investigating a drug epidemic of substance ""D"", trying to find the main source who is distributing this highly addictive, mind altering & damaging substance. As his second character, Bob Arctor, he plays along as a druggie who hangs out with a group of other low-life addicts to blend in, in hopes of finding a lead to the distributor, but slowly becomes an addict himself without really realizing it. The third character I will not tell you about, it'll ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it.Robert Downey Jr. is my absolute favorite character in this movie playing the highly intelligent, corky, hilarious, very expressional James Barris who is one of the addicts whom Arctor is spying on. Why more people didn't praise his performance for this movie is beyond me. You just can't help but laugh at his very comical facial expressions.Woody Harrelson plays as Ernie Luckman, who is kind of the laid back follower of the drug scene group. When he and Barris end up together they make a real funny pair, almost like two brothers always fighting with each other and picking on each other.Winona Ryder's character, Donna Hawthorne is Bob Arctor's girlfriend...kind of, she plays a very distant one never allowing Bob to hold her or really touch her sexually, her excuse? A bad habit of cocaine. But there is more to Donna than meets the eye, and that's for you to watch and find out.Rory Cochrane plays a great tweak-er by the name of Charles Frek, or just Frek who is paranoid about everything around him, constantly twitching, scratching and looking over his shoulder.Everyone will perceive different concepts from this film. Some of you will find it sad, funny, suspenseful, confusing, or just dull if you don't get it.

1028867,A2DXOD9HQBE1FL,B000JMK6LW,"Kevin Rienecker ""Kev""","[1, 5]","Indie-film wonder boy, writer/director Richard Linklater, tackles the film adaptation of uber-paranoid cult author Philip K. Dick's science-fiction masterpiece, A Scanner Darkly; the fames author's drug-addled look at a suburban future where we've lost the war on drugs and the government cheerfully monitors and controls its citizens.A Scanner Darkly is the perfect example of how difficult it is to adapt a film from a celebrated writer's work. How true does a filmmaker need to stay to the source material, while putting their own stamp on the end product? To that end, Linklater stays pretty close to the novel, but applies the same rotoscoping animation technique he first used with his film 'Waking Life', with varying degrees of success; the animation is uneven, alternately looking amazing, flooded with tiny background details that nobody would even notice if this were a live action film; and then suddenly shifts in quality, degenerating into something like a bad frame stolen from the television show 'King of the Hill' -- and the shift often happens in the same scene.The cast, consisting of Keanu Reeves, Robert Downy Jr., Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and Rory Cochrane are game, if not particularly interesting - Downy and Cochrane are the only folks who breathe much life into their roles, but Cochrane's performance consists mostly of annoyingly stereotypical junkie-jerks and twitches; and as the lead, Keanu brings as much personality to his character as a flavorless block of moldy cheese.It's tough to say how well the story would have played without the animated graphic-novel look. But even though the rotoscoping adds a bizarre, acid-like quality initially, there's a reason the technology didn't take off, way back when Ralph Bakshi was using the cost-cutting technique to produce his early animated adaptation of Lord of the Rings in the 70's, and later Fire and Ice, his cult collaboration with famed fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta. Ultimately, here it's distracting, especially combined with Linklater's trademarked existentially loopy, chatter-a-lot-but-say-nothing dialogue and Keanu's weak performance at the center of the film. No matter how many drug-induced bugs Linklater has Cochrane maniacally try to scrub off, he completely diffuses the edge that made Philip K. Dick's prose so realistically creepy.",3,Slacker filmmaker meets paranoid visionary writer...,1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,2343,"['Indie-film', 'wonder', 'boy', 'writer/director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'film', 'adaptation', 'uber-paranoid', 'cult', 'author', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'science-fiction', 'masterpiece', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'fames', 'author', 'drug-addled', 'look', 'suburban', 'future', 'where', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'war', 'drugs', 'government', 'cheerfully', 'monitors', 'citizens.A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'film', 'celebrated', 'writer', 'work', 'How', 'true', 'filmmaker', 'need', 'stay', 'source', 'material', 'putting', 'own', 'stamp', 'end', 'product', 'end', 'Linklater', 'pretty', 'close', 'novel', 'same', 'rotoscoping', 'animation', 'technique', 'first', 'used', 'film', ""'Waking"", 'Life', 'varying', 'degrees', 'success', 'animation', 'uneven', 'alternately', 'looking', 'amazing', 'flooded', 'tiny', 'background', 'details', 'nobody', 'would', 'even', 'notice', 'were', 'live', 'action', 'film', 'then', 'suddenly', 'shifts', 'quality', 'degenerating', 'something', 'bad', 'frame', 'stolen', 'television', 'show', ""'King"", 'Hill', 'shift', 'often', 'same', 'scene.The', 'cast', 'consisting', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Robert', 'Downy', 'Jr.', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'are', 'game', 'not', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'Downy', 'Cochrane', 'are', 'only', 'folks', 'who', 'breathe', 'much', 'life', 'roles', 'Cochrane', 'performance', 'mostly', 'annoyingly', 'stereotypical', 'junkie-jerks', 'twitches', 'lead', 'Keanu', 'as', 'much', 'personality', 'character', 'flavorless', 'block', 'moldy', 'cheese.It', 'tough', 'say', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'animated', 'graphic-novel', 'look', 'even', 'rotoscoping', 'bizarre', 'acid-like', 'quality', 'initially', 'reason', 'technology', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'off', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'was', 'using', 'cost-cutting', 'technique', 'produce', 'early', 'animated', 'adaptation', 'Lord', 'Rings', '70', 'later', 'Fire', 'Ice', 'cult', 'collaboration', 'famed', 'fantasy', 'illustrator', 'Frank', 'Frazetta', 'Ultimately', 'here', 'distracting', 'especially', 'combined', 'Linklater', 'trademarked', 'existentially', 'loopy', 'chatter-a-lot-but-say-nothing', 'dialogue', 'Keanu', 'weak', 'performance', 'center', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'many', 'drug-induced', 'bugs', 'Linklater', 'Cochrane', 'maniacally', 'try', 'scrub', 'off', 'completely', 'edge', 'made', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'prose', 'so', 'realistically', 'creepy']",N/A
1028868,A22TZUXUKA11SQ,B000JMK6LW,"K. Hinton ""avid reader""","[7, 20]","Seven years from now, there is an epidemic of drug addiction plaguing the streets of California.  The drug, Substance D, is never really explicitly explained but you sort of understand that it's highly addictive and over time does serious damage to your brain.  Keanu Reeves stars as Bob Arctor, an undercover policeman trying to infiltrate the ranks of the dealers of this illicit substance.  In fact, he's so undercover that no one in his unit even knows what he looks like as he must always be dressed in a sort of shapeshifter costume so he's not recognized.  His mission is to get higher and higher up the drug chain until he learns who the largest suppliers are.  In doing so he must masquerade as a Substance D addict himself and this includes hanging out with a bunch of fellow addicts played by Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, Rory Cochrane and his girlfriend, Winona Ryder.This movie moves slowly and the story is unforgivably convoluted.  I knew things were going downhill when, at a free preview screening, one of my friends said halfway through, ""I'm bored, can we please leave?"" Don't get me wrong, the animation was excellent and the premise was interesting, but the follow through was shaky at best.  This film could have been at least half an hour shorter and without a clear resolution I was left wondering what I was supposed to get from it.

1028872,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B000JMK6LW,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[8, 16]","Philip Dick was--and is--one of the world's great science fiction writers. It's unfortunate that he's no longer with us; he died in the early 1980s--in fact, just before Blade Runner was released commercially. He was less than 60 years old when he left us and the primary reason for his early departure was drugs.Dick did a lot of drugs. That is, on the surface, unrelated to the high quality of his prolific output but in fact is directly related to it. In A Scanner Darkly--one of, if not the most autobiographical of his novels--he presents the shattering effects of heavy use of a fictional drug, Substance D (likely read LSD), on one of its users--splitting his personality.Or at least that's what happens to the protagonist, Fred/Bob Arctor. In the film version of this novel, just released as of this writing (July 2006), the writer/director Richard Linklater follows the story of the novel to a T and uses digital rotoscoping, as he did in his previous film Waking Life, but in this case to translate Dick's dark vision into cinematic form.Basically digital rotoscoping superimposes an animation overlay on top of live action. This means that actors like Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Winona Ryder and Woody Harrelson are all recognizable as exactly who they are under the flat two-D images we see on the screen. The word ""flat"" is appropriate in this context. Dick's ideas are, as usual, strong and intriguing, but the bottom line is that this is a highly cerebral tale.What this means, in turn, is that there is little emotional resonance that echoes in and throughout the film. Some characters are not who they appear to be initially, and that's OK. But we never really, actually FEEL anything for any of the characters because the cerebral nature of the novel is brought out, for sure, but the true underlying sadness that Dick was really portraying here is basically ignored.In fact, we don't really understand this sadness until we get to the end credits where, faithfully duplicating the book, we see a list of people who have either died or suffered serious physical/body damage (i.e., brain damage, pancreatic trauma, etc.) as a result of massive drug use. The note that Dick wrote to accompany this list is also faithfully reproduced in these end credits, in which he mourns their deaths and destruction (his name is on the list as well) and hopes they will be able to play happily...in another world.The digital rotoscoping is most effective when we see Fred/Bob Arctor and Hank (his boss) in their scramble suits which hides their real identities from anyone else by presenting constantly shifting faces--a myriad of them--to the outside world while meanwhile the real person inside the suit also has his voice disguised by another suit mechanism. But other than that, what we can see is that the animation is really used to in essence offer up a kind of visual cinematic irony--even cynicism--that does even more to emphasize the analytical stuff Dick loved in his writing without the emotional stuff he also, occasionally used (cf. Blade Runner, probably the most effective film made from a Philip Dick novel).Arctor's heavy use of Substance D splits him into cop and drug user; one of his cronies instead suffers from an occasional psychotic state that makes him feel bugs crawling all over him all the time (same drug, different effect). This is not so much a warning to those who might use drugs not to, but instead a recounting of what can--and did--happen to someone who overused them, but with the added irony of the split personality being ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" both in the same person.Linklater has done a superior job in translating the Dick novel into film. The digital rotoscoping work here is excellent. But we come out of the film and feel flat. We don't really come away with anything sticking to us because the sadness that should have been a much more intense and powerful theme integral to the film is just not there. Drug abuse is serious stuff and at bottom it IS sad.We just don't feel that sadness. That's a shame. If the sense of loss had been expressed much more substantially, this would easily have rated five stars.

1028873,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B000JMK6LW,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[97, 105]","This is a movie you definitely want on DVD - because you'll want to watch it first with just the movie playing, and then after that with the audio soundtrack that includes director Richard Linklater, actor Keanu Reeves and most importantly the daughter of Philip K Dick. The insights that she provides into the movie and the storyline are priceless.It's important to realize that Philip K Dick usually wrote about characters, not action sequences - and specifically, he wrote about those in society who did not ""fit in"" well. If you look through his stories, you'll find they often feature people who are misfits, who society overlooks or forgets. In A Scanner Darkly, the featured 'oddballs' are druggies hooked on Substance D - a drug that is never really described, but apparently causes paranoia and hallucinations.The key here is to sit down with a glass of wine, a big bowl of popcorn and settle back for a character-driven story. This isn't a Rambo or Dirty Dozen story - it's about how people relate to each other, in many subtle ways. It's a study of interactions.I really appreciate that this was done in a combination of real life acting and animation. It floors me that in modern times anyone might look down on this because it is a ""cartoon"". Is a Renoir less worthy than an Ansel Adams because a Renoir was done by hand? Animation isn't inherently kiddie. Hand drawn works can contain quite mature topics. In this case it is *ideally* suited to the story - because a main aspect of the tale is that the characters never quite know what is real and what is imagination. Are the bugs really there? Can he trust what he sees? All signs point to NO. The viewer is caught up in this same confused world. If this had been live action, then 'odd things' would have instantly stood out. But the point of a drug haze is that everything seems 'unreal' - and so odd things fit into that flow much more smoothly.If you don't know druggies, rest assured that characters like this are quite average - and this story is in essence an autobiography of Philip K Dick's life in the 70s. He lived in a house just like this with his two brothers after his divorce. He lost his wife and two young girls. He was very paranoid that one of his house-mates was a narc, spying on their druggie activities. One of his friends did think bugs were crawling on him. At the end of the movie is Dick's actual ending to the story - a list of his friends who were damaged or slain by drugs. Included on this list are his ex-wife and himself.So what you have in the movie are the druggies at turns being nice to each other, being very cruel to each other, mistrusting each other, and turning to each other for help. One of the druggies - Bob - is actually a narc cop code-named Fred. He's gone undercover to figure out who is supplying Substance D to the area. Unfortunately, he's gotten himself hooked during his undercover work. Even worse, part of what Substance D does is to destroy your brain - so he's developed in essence split personalities. The Bob-Druggie part forgets most of the time he IS a narc. The narc half of him, when he's in the police station, knows he's spying on this group of druggies but forgets that he is one of them. So when the narc is told to specifically spy on ""Bob"", he literally doesn't realize that this is him.Here's where the movie - trying to stuff a dense book into under 2 hours - has some problems. If you haven't read the book, it's not clear at all that Narc-Fred forgets who he is when he goes undercover as Bob. It's a big twist in the book, but in the movie it seems clear to the watcher that it's the same person, and it's not made clear in the story that he's forgetting his ""other half"".Other than that, the story is really pretty straightforward, plot-wise. The druggies are paranoid about the world around them and plug on with their lives. The cops are trying to figure out who the supplier is, so they bug the house and try to get that information. Like most Dick stories, there's a twist, although to be honest I thought it would be a much larger twist. Also, like most Dick stories, there's little female presence and the ending is only slightly hopeful. These aren't happy-go-lucky romances that he writes - they are dark warnings about where society is heading when it marginalizes those who don't fit in perfectly.If you're confused about the movie, I definitely recommend reading the novel. That might be easier to grasp and give you more insight into the characters. Then go back and watch the movie again - taking it slow. Pay attention to the nuances of what they say, and how the characters relate. See how they feel society is treating them - and then take a look what society actually does with these people. Maybe they aren't quite so paranoid after all - maybe there is some resaon for how they feel.",5,A Worthy Version of a Classic Story,1169164800,"01 19, 2007",2007,4846,"['movie', 'definitely', 'want', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'first', 'just', 'movie', 'playing', 'then', 'audio', 'soundtrack', 'director', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'actor', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'most', 'importantly', 'daughter', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'insights', 'movie', 'storyline', 'are', 'priceless.It', 'important', 'realize', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'usually', 'wrote', 'characters', 'not', 'action', 'sequences', 'specifically', 'wrote', 'society', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'well', 'look', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'find', 'often', 'feature', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'misfits', 'who', 'society', 'overlooks', 'forgets', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'featured', ""'oddballs"", 'are', 'druggies', 'hooked', 'Substance', 'D', 'drug', 'never', 'really', 'described', 'apparently', 'paranoia', 'hallucinations.The', 'key', 'here', 'sit', 'down', 'glass', 'wine', 'big', 'bowl', 'popcorn', 'settle', 'back', 'character-driven', 'story', ""n't"", 'Rambo', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'story', 'how', 'people', 'relate', 'other', 'many', 'subtle', 'ways', 'study', 'interactions.I', 'really', 'appreciate', 'was', 'done', 'combination', 'real', 'life', 'acting', 'animation', 'modern', 'times', 'anyone', 'might', 'look', 'down', 'cartoon', 'Renoir', 'less', 'worthy', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'Renoir', 'was', 'done', 'hand', 'Animation', ""n't"", 'inherently', 'kiddie', 'Hand', 'drawn', 'works', 'can', 'contain', 'quite', 'mature', 'topics', 'case', '*ideally*', 'suited', 'story', 'main', 'aspect', 'tale', 'characters', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'what', 'imagination', 'Are', 'bugs', 'really', 'Can', 'trust', 'what', 'signs', 'point', 'NO', 'viewer', 'caught', 'up', 'same', 'confused', 'world', 'had', 'been', 'live', 'action', 'then', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'instantly', 'stood', 'out', 'point', 'drug', 'haze', 'everything', 'so', 'odd', 'things', 'fit', 'flow', 'much', 'more', 'smoothly.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'druggies', 'rest', 'assured', 'characters', 'are', 'quite', 'average', 'story', 'essence', 'autobiography', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'life', '70s', 'lived', 'house', 'just', 'two', 'brothers', 'divorce', 'lost', 'wife', 'two', 'young', 'girls', 'was', 'very', 'paranoid', 'one', 'house-mates', 'was', 'narc', 'spying', 'druggie', 'activities', 'One', 'friends', 'did', 'think', 'bugs', 'were', 'crawling', 'end', 'movie', 'Dick', 'actual', 'ending', 'story', 'list', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'damaged', 'slain', 'drugs', 'Included', 'list', 'are', 'ex-wife', 'himself.So', 'what', 'have', 'movie', 'are', 'druggies', 'turns', 'being', 'nice', 'other', 'being', 'very', 'cruel', 'other', 'mistrusting', 'other', 'turning', 'other', 'help', 'One', 'druggies', 'Bob', 'actually', 'narc', 'cop', 'code-named', 'Fred', 'gone', 'undercover', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'supplying', 'Substance', 'D', 'area', 'Unfortunately', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'undercover', 'work', 'Even', 'worse', 'part', 'what', 'Substance', 'D', 'destroy', 'brain', 'developed', 'essence', 'split', 'personalities', 'Bob-Druggie', 'part', 'most', 'time', 'narc', 'narc', 'half', 'when', 'police', 'station', 'spying', 'group', 'druggies', 'forgets', 'one', 'So', 'when', 'narc', 'told', 'specifically', 'spy', 'Bob', 'literally', ""n't"", 'realize', 'where', 'movie', 'trying', 'stuff', 'dense', 'book', '2', 'hours', 'problems', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'not', 'clear', 'Narc-Fred', 'forgets', 'who', 'when', 'undercover', 'Bob', 'big', 'twist', 'book', 'movie', 'clear', 'watcher', 'same', 'person', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'story', 'forgetting', 'other', 'half', '.Other', 'story', 'really', 'pretty', 'straightforward', 'plot-wise', 'druggies', 'are', 'paranoid', 'world', 'plug', 'lives', 'cops', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'supplier', 'bug', 'house', 'try', 'get', 'information', 'most', 'Dick', 'stories', 'twist', 'be', 'honest', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'larger', 'twist', 'Also', 'most', 'Dick', 'stories', 'little', 'female', 'presence', 'ending', 'only', 'slightly', 'hopeful', 'are', ""n't"", 'happy-go-lucky', 'romances', 'are', 'dark', 'warnings', 'where', 'society', 'heading', 'when', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'perfectly.If', ""'re"", 'confused', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'reading', 'novel', 'might', 'be', 'easier', 'grasp', 'give', 'more', 'insight', 'characters', 'Then', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'taking', 'slow', 'Pay', 'attention', 'nuances', 'what', 'say', 'how', 'characters', 'relate', 'See', 'how', 'feel', 'society', 'treating', 'then', 'take', 'look', 'what', 'actually', 'people', 'Maybe', 'are', ""n't"", 'quite', 'so', 'paranoid', 'maybe', 'resaon', 'how', 'feel']",N/A

1028875,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B000JMK6LW,"Maine Writer ""David""","[1, 8]","In this age of half-baked political ""insights"" -- which compare the current administration to everything from Nazi Germany to George Orwell -- one can already see another one coming.  Even here, some are suggesting that A Scanner Darkly warns of us the dangers of the War on Terror gone out of control ... that it's a cautionary tale about Republican-style invasions of privacy.It doesn't.  And it isn't.What it is about, however, is how well-meaning, intelligent people looking to play a little (and maybe die a little) often choose dangerous chemicals for recreation.  In fact, this movie does a great job of showing how and why people play with such fire.  Each person in the film is just trying to cope, trying to bring a little a peace and fun into a world where they don't quite fit.  And drugs, including the ominous Substance D (more about this drug below), ease the pain, help you sleep, and bring some real numbed diversion -- while also screwing up your life by destroying relationships, human feelings, your sex drive, and your sanity.  It shows the fun, and fog, going hand in hand, with lives teetering in a world of delusion, paranoia, and finally death.  Just before the credits roll, you're treated to a list of people that have destroyed their health and lives in this all-too-human affair -- including the story's author himself, Philip K. Dick.Plotwise, the story is about a society ravaged by a new drug, Substance D, which has turned a very large percentage of the population into addicts.  The main character, played by Keanu Reeves, is a police investigator deep in the middle of it -- both literally and figuratively.  And along the way, he's not only developed a raging addiction to Substance D, but has begun to suffer its signature effects, including the bizarre perceptual problems that occur when one half of the brain is split from the other. But we see fairly early on that doctors and others on the police force are aware of his drug use, and, indeed, seem to be keeping tabs on it.  He doesn't get arrested when caught in a drug buy (through high-tech surveillance), doesn't get turned in when a blood test reveals he's a user.  Something is afoot.  And then he's assigned to surveil himself, and doesn't even seem to know who he's watching.I'm not going to give away the ending, but not because it's especially interesting or satisfying ... only because it supposed to come as a surprise.  The problem is that the movie is so unnecessarily obtuse and difficult (far moreso than the book) that the surprise becomes more of an, ""Oh. So I guess that's why this, that, and the other thing happened. Why didn't you just tell me (or at least give me more sophisticated clues to follow)?""Which about sums up why this movie, in the end, was dissatisfying.  It feels long, repetitive, and intentionally murky -- as if the director's idea was to entertain by disorientation and a fairly accurate characterization of the look and feel of bright, drug-addled creative types. I suppose those are interesting goals, but not for a two-hour movie that does, in fact, have a plot and a worthy message.  The animation technique is interesting and suits the subject matter, but it, alone can't and shouldn't, carry the film.  All around, the acting is pretty solid, and it was nice to see Winona Ryder again.  Notably, the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. was inspired, and his performance right on the mark.In a summer where so many movies are soulless, boring money machines, at least A Scanner Darkly aspires for greater things.

I was surprised to see it was animated but they did a great job. It is not a sweet story and it is not easy to watch. Ah, they have captured the essense of Philip K Dick. His stories are never an easy read and as my 1970's friends said, he often leaves you gibbering and dazed for days after you read his novels. Like Harlan Ellison, his writing is powerful to the extent of being sometimes nauseating. Hey, if the opening scenes of this movie don't make your skin crawl, you're not quite right. But PKD and Ellison pay you back with unforgettable stories. Read ""Through A Scanner Darkly"" and then see the movie and you'll understand it better. For instance, one of the most classic scenes in the book is when the large breasted neighbor girl the boys have all been after comes over to beg them to come over and kill a mosquito for them. Turns out the huge mosquito was not a mosquito but a ""mosquito hawk"" - a large bug which looks like a mosquito but actually eats mosquitos. The boys explain this to her and she utters the classic line: ""Well, if I had known it was harmless, I'd have killed it myself."" The boys go down to their apartment and write her words on a sheet of paper and hang it on the wall as a classic stupid thing to say. In the movie, it is treated as an inside joke between the actors and the part of the audience that have read the book when they kill a bug in the car. (Thanks for the mammaries...) The book is a great read. Amazing that PKD's work is being made into movies (Blade Runner, etc.) now that his psychodelic genius is gone. You know, he said the only way he would come to Hollywood to write is if they killed him, propped him upright in the driver's seat and painted a smile on his face and rolled him into town.

Ironically, that also captures the audience's feelings about the whole movie: you either love it or loathe it.The polarized reviews this film has received should make it obvious that it isn't for everyone. Most people who panned it complained about the movie's emphasis on dialogue and character development -- as opposed to the noticeable lack of explosions, sex, and stock Hollywood schlock. This is a film that requires the viewer to (gasp!) PAY ATTENTION, so those who prefer mindless popcorn flicks are going to be confused and/or bored. You have to like this sort of thing, and obviously not everyone does.I love this film, but I'm more forgiving of its flaws because I'd already read the book. Still, the movie stands on its own if you don't know the novel. There's enough going on beneath the surface or in the background that multiple views are usually required. I've seen it about four times now, and still manage to pick up some little nuance that eluded me previously. If you're willing to invest the effort, Scanner Darkly is most rewarding.Obviously, it's possible to *like* something but not *get* it, just as you can *get* something but not *like* it.

In Scanner, Dick takes on the drug-counterculture, exploring both sides with an equally jaundiced eye. Keanu Reeves is Bob Arctor, a narcotics agent whose job is to infiltrate drug dens undercover. It is so critical that he remain anonymous that he is physically concealed by a ""scramble suit"" he wears to work, shifting his features constantly  into a variety of mismatched human forms.  It's unsettling - even his voice is concealed - and Arctor's identity is unknown even to his fellow agents, who also wear these suits.  In essence, nobody knows who anybody else is.Including themselves. Arctor is also a drug dealer, who doles out and is addicted to a powerful drug, known as Substance D. This drug is instantly addictive. There is no genetic propensity for addiction; anyone who takes it even once becomes an addict. No wonder that the government wants to take down the organization distributing it so badly.The organization distributing it is also a treatment center for addicts, New Path.  It uses its drug-addled labor to farm its blue flowers to make the little blue pills. Everyone is both helping and hurting the drug cause, and it soon becomes clear that it's no longer a question of ethics as to what's right and wrong as the whole industry, both pro- and anti-drug, is so interconnected that one cannot exist without the other.  Drug addicts become narcs, narcs become drug addicts, and identities are swapped with abandon.As Arctor navigates his drug haze of a life, complete with junkies who live in his house, it becomes clear that he was something else once: a family man, a husband, a father of two little children (""this high"" he says, holding one hand at about hip level).In the final act the film shifts perception to a surprising third party and we understand that A Scanner Darkly has much in common with Robocop, a world where corruption is rampant and the only faith worth having is in one's family.A Scanner Darkly is Rotoscoped and it's easy to see why.  Between the constantly morphing perception of Arctor, the psychedelic effects of drug addiction, and the ever-shifting concealing suits, the entire experience is like a fever dream. Although it's not always easy to untangle, A Scanner Darkly is worth a closer look.",4,Worth a closer look,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,2329,"['Scanner', 'Darkly', 'yet', 'movie', 'inspired', 'Philip', 'K', 'Dick', 'literature', 'Scanner', 'Dick', 'drug-counterculture', 'exploring', 'sides', 'equally', 'jaundiced', 'eye', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Bob', 'Arctor', 'narcotics', 'agent', 'job', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'dens', 'undercover', 'so', 'critical', 'remain', 'anonymous', 'physically', 'concealed', 'scramble', 'suit', 'work', 'shifting', 'features', 'constantly', 'variety', 'mismatched', 'human', 'forms', 'unsettling', 'even', 'voice', 'concealed', 'Arctor', 'identity', 'unknown', 'even', 'fellow', 'agents', 'who', 'also', 'wear', 'suits', 'essence', 'nobody', 'knows', 'who', 'anybody', 'else', 'is.Including', 'Arctor', 'also', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'out', 'addicted', 'powerful', 'drug', 'known', 'Substance', 'D.', 'drug', 'instantly', 'addictive', 'genetic', 'propensity', 'addiction', 'anyone', 'who', 'even', 'once', 'addict', 'wonder', 'government', 'take', 'down', 'organization', 'distributing', 'so', 'badly.The', 'organization', 'distributing', 'also', 'treatment', 'center', 'addicts', 'New', 'Path', 'drug-addled', 'labor', 'farm', 'blue', 'flowers', 'make', 'little', 'blue', 'pills', 'Everyone', 'helping', 'hurting', 'drug', 'cause', 'soon', 'clear', 'no', 'longer', 'question', 'ethics', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'whole', 'industry', 'pro-', 'anti-drug', 'so', 'interconnected', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'other', 'Drug', 'become', 'narcs', 'narcs', 'become', 'drug', 'addicts', 'identities', 'are', 'swapped', 'abandon.As', 'Arctor', 'drug', 'haze', 'life', 'complete', 'junkies', 'who', 'live', 'house', 'clear', 'was', 'something', 'else', 'once', 'family', 'man', 'husband', 'father', 'two', 'little', 'children', 'high', 'holding', 'one', 'hand', 'hip', 'level', 'final', 'act', 'film', 'shifts', 'perception', 'surprising', 'third', 'party', 'understand', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'much', 'common', 'Robocop', 'world', 'where', 'corruption', 'rampant', 'only', 'faith', 'worth', 'having', 'one', 'family.A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Rotoscoped', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'constantly', 'morphing', 'perception', 'Arctor', 'psychedelic', 'effects', 'drug', 'addiction', 'ever-shifting', 'concealing', 'suits', 'entire', 'experience', 'fever', 'dream', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'untangle', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'closer', 'look']",N/A

1028884,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000JMK6LW,mirasreviews,"[9, 9]","""A Scanner Darkly"" is director Richard Linklater's second feature to employ rotoscoping, in which illustrators draw over the film or digital image to create animation that preserves the actors' performances. This is especially suited to the uncertain reality and identity-concealing ""scramble suits"" of Phillip K. Dick's novel of paranoia and oppression. Seven years from now, a highly addictive drug called Substance D sweeps the nation, destroying the lives and brains of millions. Fred (Keanu Reeves) is a narcotics agent assigned to observe drug dealer Bob Arctor. Bob lives with a shifty, garrulous dealer named Jim Barris (Robert Downey, Jr.) and fellow junkie Ernie Luckman (Woody Harrelson), while he pines for frigid girlfriend Donna (Winona Ryder). But Bob is in fact Fred, who became a Substance D user while undercover and is now unable to connect his two identities.Although ""A Scanner Darkly""'s animation is drawn with relatively broad strokes, its ""painterly version of reality"" allows the actors' performances to come through clearly. Robert Downey, Jr.'s clever, nearly incessant chatter is particularly memorable. There are a lot of long, inane conversations that fans of the novel may appreciate while other viewers may feel should have been left out. Those conversations slow the film down a lot, but on the other hand, it 's funny stuff. There is no denying that this is a movie for a certain taste. The animation is self-consciously stylized. The pace is uneven. The story is nebulous. But it has a lot to offer.""A Scanner Darkly"" seems to be first and foremost about paranoia, a subject that Phillip K. Dick knew intimately. The story itself is paranoid. The characters are paranoid. Junkies, authorities, and the public at large are overcome by fear of one another. When Phillip K. Dick wrote the book in 1977, it was a comment on the government's persecution of the drug counterculture and a reflection of Dick's own state of mind. Thirty years later, the widespread surveillance, fear-mongering media, and suspension of civil liberties in the name of public safety seem to be taken from today's headlines. ""A Scanner Darkly"" could still easily refer to the War on Drugs, but a government that engenders fear at home to justify military adventurism abroad seems more like the War on Terror. Or perhaps it is just that all ideological wars are the same.Phillip K. Dick put a lot of himself into ""A Scanner Darkly"" and dedicated the book to his friends who lost their lives to drugs. Sometimes that adds interest. Sometimes it muddies ideas that could have been more pointed, as in the film's conflicted attitude toward drug use. But Phillip K. Dick fans will find another layer on which to view the film in Dick's personal preoccupations. Bob/Fred's break-in to his own home seems to mirror Dick's suspicion that he may have himself been responsible for the break-in that bolstered his belief that he was under FBI surveillance. And Bob Farris' ratting out his friends to the authorities for no apparent reason? Richard Linklater wrote and directed "" A Scanner Darkly"" with fans of the novel in mind, preserving its quirks. What was a dystopian picture of the near future when it was written is now provocative film about contemporary questions of civil liberties and the politics of fear.The DVD (Warner 2006): Bonus features are 2 featurettes, an audio commentary, and theatrical trailer (2 min). ""One Summer in Austin: The Story of Filming a Scanner Darkly"" (26 min) consists of interviews with Richard Linklater, the cast, and Phillip K. Dick's daughter Isa Dick Hackett, in which they talk about the film's themes and characters. Phillip K. Dick also appears in some archival interview footage. ""The Weight of the Line: Animation Tales"" (20 min) interviews Linklater, some of the lead animators, cinematographer Sterling Allen, and producer Tommy Pallotta about the18-month post-production process during which the film was animated. No discussion of the problems that resulted in firing the original head of animation.

1028888,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000JMK6LW,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","Those who criticise this film for lacking in narrative drive are either missing the point or had been expecting something different.  It is true that there is very little ""plot"" here (until the end), and much of the film involves sitting around the house, hanging out with Bob Arctor and his various friends and associates.  The majority of the screen time in this film is devoted to establishing an atmosphere (and leaving a few hints about a larger plot) within which the central twist of the story will make sense, rather than a conventional narrative about a character who has a more or less clearly defined problem (1st act) that he will then work to resolve (2nd act) creating further difficulties for himself whose resolution will result in a totally revised situation (3rd act).  The rotoscoping animation, combined with a pervasive lightness and sense of humor made this not at all tedious to me -- Linklater accomplishes something quite remarkable in making the situation of his characters both heartbreaking and pathetic and at the same time unbearably funny -- but I can understand why it might put some people off, especially those who thought they would be getting a mind-bending action sci-fi kind of thing (it does star Keanu Reeves, after all).  At the same time, I think it was absolutely crucial to Linklater's point (a point deeply true both to this novel of Phillip K. Dick and to his overall world view) that he make the majority of the film be about just giving us a glimpse into the minds and worlds of a group of ""junkies"" (one of whom also happened to be an undercover agent not entirely aware that he himself was the subject of his own investigation).  What dominates Phillip K. Dick's fiction is a deep sense of paranoia (radical skepticism) about the world, about the powers that be, and about the nature of reality.  This kind of paranoia is often characteristic of and associated with (especially during the time he was writing) the drug counterculture that is depicted here -- but the twist that makes this film ingenious is the suggestion that this paranoia is in fact totally justified, and that ironically the very same forces that are responsible for the illusory character of what we take to be real (the powers that be) are also the ones who both create (or at least enable and benefit from) the drugs that are responsible for the alienation of the counterculture and are the ones who lead the war on drugs.  Central to Phillip K. Dick's (and Linklater's) vision here is the insight that In an insane world, where the reality we are presented with is fiction (an Orwellian doublespeak world where ""freedom"" means ""free trade"" means ""corporations and not people rule the world"") there is a sense in which paranoid delusional drug addicts who believe Big Brother is always watching are the only ones who have a ""realistic"" grip on the way things are.  In fact, the film suggests, the paranoid fantasies of the drug addicts are fairly tame compared to the reality.

Dick's classic story to life, yet with his pretty faithful screenplay and innovative film techniques, Linklater makes perfect sense to direct A Scanner Darkly.  Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder, and Rory Cochrane play drugged up, strung out friends hooked on a drug called Substance D in Orange Country, California in the very near future.  Reeves is Bob, who unbeknownst to his friends, is an undercover spy for the government looking to gather info on the group, and wouldn't you know it that his two personalities begin to split until he doesn't know what's what.  For the most part, Linklater nails the paranoid tone and feeling of being an addict, and the performances, particularly from Downey and Cochrane, are superb.  Even Reeves goes beyond his typical, wooden self and gives a great performance.  The biggest drawback of A Scanner Darkly is also it's biggest draw however: Linklater's ""roto-scoping"" technique (giving it the graphic novel look) which he used in Waking Life, doesn't always suit the story and tone.  When the comedic elements strike, everything is brilliant.  However, when the more serious and heart breaking elements of Dick's story come into play, the animation feels gimmicky.  Despite that, A Scanner Darkly is still one of the best sci-fi movies released this year, and regardless of whether you are a fan of PKD or Linklater, this is definitely worth seeing.",4,Everything is not going to be OK,1167350400,"12 29, 2006",2006,1496,"['Richard', 'Linklater', 'may', 'seem', 'odd', 'choice', 'first', 'bring', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', 'classic', 'story', 'life', 'yet', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'screenplay', 'innovative', 'film', 'techniques', 'Linklater', 'perfect', 'sense', 'direct', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'play', 'drugged', 'up', 'strung', 'out', 'friends', 'hooked', 'drug', 'called', 'Substance', 'D', 'Orange', 'Country', 'California', 'very', 'near', 'future', 'Reeves', 'Bob', 'who', 'unbeknownst', 'friends', 'undercover', 'spy', 'government', 'looking', 'gather', 'info', 'group', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'two', 'personalities', 'begin', 'split', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'what', 'most', 'part', 'Linklater', 'paranoid', 'tone', 'feeling', 'being', 'addict', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Downey', 'Cochrane', 'are', 'superb', 'Even', 'typical', 'wooden', 'self', 'great', 'performance', 'biggest', 'drawback', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'also', 'biggest', 'draw', 'however', 'Linklater', 'roto-scoping', 'technique', 'giving', 'graphic', 'novel', 'look', 'used', 'Waking', 'Life', ""n't"", 'always', 'suit', 'story', 'tone', 'When', 'comedic', 'elements', 'strike', 'everything', 'brilliant', 'However', 'when', 'more', 'serious', 'heart', 'breaking', 'elements', 'Dick', 'story', 'come', 'play', 'animation', 'gimmicky', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'released', 'year', 'regardless', 'are', 'fan', 'PKD', 'Linklater', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

Having not read PKD's book, I don't know whether the author or the director is to blame for the plot, or lack thereof.  Before viewing, I had two impressions of the movie.  One was a main character with a dual personality (a'la Fight Club), thus creating dramatic tension as the protaganist battles with himself.  Secondly, I was expecting intelligent, perhaps philosophical exchange between the Substance D users.  Neither happened.  Keanu's character, Fred, loafs around with stoners who act like idiots, then reports back to base and watches surveillance tapes of himself and the stoners acting like idiots.  I never once got a true sense of his supposed 'dual personality' except that he does poorly on some psychological exams and he acts confused sometimes.  Secondly, what I meant about the dialogue is the SD users talk like hippies on a bad acid trip; they use big words but say nothing interesting.

1028892,AHOLIHT1HLOG1,B000JMK6LW,Panda Opa,"[5, 6]","A Scanner Darkly first caught my eye when I first saw it's trailer. The unusual visuals and amazing cast immediately grabbed my attention. I had never heard of the Phillip K. Dick novel, although the premise suggested in the trailer sounded unique and very cool. Very soon I read the book, and it amazed me how good it was. I waited in excitement and hope for the movie to be released in theaters. When it was, I was not in the least bit disappointed.The story is pretty complex. Seven years from now, we've lost the drug war. Everything you do is recorded, as well as documented. There is no escape from the government that is trying to save you. Roaming the streets is a very dangerous drug known as, Substance D. The story follows a group of drugged out friends who have been corroded by paranoia and danger. Unknown to the rest of them, their close friend, Bob Arctor, is actually an undercover narcotics officer. As the story progresses, the use of substance D begins to take it's toll on him. His undercover role as a their friend and his role as a narc begin to seperate into two different personalities. He then begins to struggle with his own fate.First off I'd like to say that this movie is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. The process of rotoscoping, which was also used in Linklater's ""Waking Life"", is truly amazing. The visual perception that this process gives you is very impressive. It really adds to the effect of the movie. The movie is worth seeing just for that.The screenplay is very well done, allowing for a wonderful adaptation of the book. One thing that stands out in this movie is the cast: Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder. It's an amazing ensemble of actors that fit their roles maybe a bit too well. Reeves easily gives the best performance as the undercover narcotics officer who is beginning to fall apart. His performance is powerful and moving, easily his best so far.In the end, A Scanner Darkly could have many different effects on you. You could be moved, depressed, confused, or even happy.

This was a fun movie, funny, with some great performances by Robert Downey Jr. and nothing too bad from anyone else, and like Waking Life was very interesting to look at (though somewhat discombobulating during moments when the camera would move and perspective would change).  Then suddenly I realized I had no idea where this was going.  It was the cinematic equivalent of listening to somebody tell a story and then suddenly realizing that you hadn't been paying attention.At first I figured it was me, that I really hadn't been paying attention.  However, thinking back on it, a few things really helped create this sudden dissonance:-The rotoscoping process.  It's pretty, and used to great effect here, but it does create an extra layer between the action and the audience that sometimes makes one want to tear through the screen to see what's really going on behind it.-A sudden and complete change of tone.  This movie went from a stoner comedy to a depressing drama in the blink of an eye, and the blink was covered up by the rotoscoping process so we missed it.-Random changes in exposition.  From different subjective camera shots to a sudden use of voice-over narration to finally just dropping one perspective and changing characters, the movie just suddenly glides off-track like a car on ice.  Or maybe I was wrong to think that Keanu Reeve's character was the character through which we were supposed to understand the plot, and really it was a more ""objective"" camera we were behind... which makes the druggy subjective animation kind of ill-fitting...Actually, this use of audience dissonance could be a superb use of structure, where something that is fun and funny suddenly becomes deathly serious to the point of schizophrenia... like the drug in the film.  That would be very interesting if that were true.I really liked most of the movie and Robert Downey Jr.'s character was fantastic, but I can't say I really liked the end result.

Dick's 1977 novel of the same name, this unlikely mix of sci-fi, political and existential elements has more twists to its plot than a bag of pretzels. Filmed in live action, it was painstakingly (500 hours of work per minute of film) traced over in animation to awesome results. Quietly released in July to less than 300 theaters nationwide, it deserves a second life on DVD.While it is faithful to Dick's classic, some crucial changes are made, the most important being the alteration from a setting in 1994 to one in 2013 where Americans are monitored around the clock by their government, wear special suits to mask their identities, and are losing the War on Drugs. Much like today, the more high tech our lives become, the more freedom there is to be lost.Bob Arctor, played by Keanu Reeves, is employed by the government to help eradicate the mercilessly addictive drug known simply as ""D."" However, his job requires he sample it, leading him to a double life that the drug keeps him from being fully aware of - narc by day, addict by night.Life is no picnic for his chums, either. His friends Freck and Luckman, played by Rory Cochrane and Woody Harrelson respectively, are unrivaled in their paranoia, particularly Freck, who is so addicted he wakes up to the sensation of ravaging aphids all over his body and envisions his own assassination at the hands of the police.He confides in Barris, played masterfully by Robert Downey Jr., whose scruples become so questionable that it underscores the helpless world these characters face. The always brilliant Winona Ryder plays Arctor's emotionally stunted girlfriend Donna who has more up her sleeve than meets the eye.Reeves has never been an outstanding actor, still coasting on his pretty boy looks in his early forties. This does not matter. This not a character piece and it need not be. These are everyday people, particularly Arctor himself, the consummate family man until his life goes topsy turvy. The story is thus unfortunately true to life, as drug convictions happen routinely with big time traffickers scoring deals with prosecutors that end up severely punishing those lower on the totem pole instead. The 2013 world of ""A Scanner Darkly"" amplifies this truth to an extent that may well be just around the bend.It is impossible to view the film and feel instantly tuned in to its capricious plot elements, but this does it no disservice.This is no kiddie comic book sci-fi, and although it has touches of comedic and camp elements, it demands an open mind and an attentive viewing to be appreciated for its sheer relevance.",5,No Kiddie Comic Book Sci-Fi,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2716,"['indie', 'film', 'past', 'six', 'months', 'worthier', 'rent', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Based', 'Philip', 'K.', 'Dick', '1977', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'unlikely', 'mix', 'sci-fi', 'political', 'existential', 'elements', 'more', 'twists', 'plot', 'bag', 'pretzels', 'Filmed', 'live', 'action', 'was', 'painstakingly', '500', 'hours', 'work', 'minute', 'film', 'traced', 'animation', 'awesome', 'results', 'Quietly', 'released', 'July', 'less', '300', 'theaters', 'nationwide', 'second', 'life', 'DVD.While', 'faithful', 'Dick', 'classic', 'crucial', 'changes', 'are', 'made', 'most', 'important', 'being', 'alteration', 'setting', '1994', 'one', '2013', 'where', 'Americans', 'are', 'monitored', 'clock', 'government', 'wear', 'special', 'suits', 'mask', 'identities', 'are', 'losing', 'War', 'Drugs', 'Much', 'today', 'more', 'high', 'lives', 'become', 'more', 'freedom', 'be', 'lost.Bob', 'Arctor', 'played', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'employed', 'government', 'help', 'eradicate', 'mercilessly', 'addictive', 'drug', 'known', 'simply', 'D.', 'However', 'job', 'sample', 'leading', 'double', 'life', 'drug', 'being', 'fully', 'aware', 'narc', 'day', 'addict', 'night.Life', 'picnic', 'chums', 'either', 'friends', 'Freck', 'Luckman', 'played', 'Rory', 'Cochrane', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'respectively', 'are', 'unrivaled', 'paranoia', 'particularly', 'Freck', 'who', 'so', 'addicted', 'up', 'sensation', 'ravaging', 'aphids', 'body', 'envisions', 'own', 'assassination', 'hands', 'police.He', 'confides', 'Barris', 'played', 'masterfully', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'scruples', 'become', 'so', 'questionable', 'helpless', 'world', 'characters', 'face', 'always', 'brilliant', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'Arctor', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'girlfriend', 'Donna', 'who', 'more', 'up', 'sleeve', 'eye.Reeves', 'never', 'been', 'outstanding', 'actor', 'still', 'coasting', 'pretty', 'boy', 'looks', 'early', 'forties', 'not', 'matter', 'not', 'character', 'piece', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'are', 'everyday', 'people', 'particularly', 'Arctor', 'consummate', 'family', 'man', 'life', 'topsy', 'turvy', 'story', 'thus', 'unfortunately', 'true', 'life', 'drug', 'convictions', 'happen', 'routinely', 'big', 'time', 'traffickers', 'scoring', 'deals', 'prosecutors', 'end', 'up', 'severely', 'punishing', 'lower', 'totem', 'pole', 'instead', '2013', 'world', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'truth', 'extent', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'just', 'bend.It', 'impossible', 'view', 'film', 'feel', 'instantly', 'tuned', 'capricious', 'plot', 'elements', 'disservice.This', 'kiddie', 'comic', 'book', 'sci-fi', 'touches', 'comedic', 'camp', 'elements', 'open', 'mind', 'attentive', 'viewing', 'be', 'appreciated', 'sheer', 'relevance']",N/A

1028910,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000JMK6LW,Samuel McKewon,"[8, 38]","""A Scanner Darkly"" opens to the sight of aphids - fat, green ones - doing a world tour of a drug addict's body. The guy scrubs them off. They come back. He scrubs them off again - with pesticide - only to find them on his dog. So now it's the guy and his mutt crouched in a shallow tub full of imaginary bugs. And it's just the start of his damn day.That's the best scene in Richard Linklater's otherwise slow, talky adaptation of Phillip K. Dick's novel on futuristic drug addiction. The writer/director has always favored a stuffed screenplay  - this one packs, oh, 466 monologues. And here he combines this expansive literacy with a computer animation called rotoscoping: Linklater films the movie and throws some digital cartoon paint on it to create static, sleep-inducing images that only make the movie more impenetrable.It's inert and arrogant as it seeks to fuse its tale of government conspiracy with a  commentary on stoner culture: Their visions, fears, wasted days. Linklater pummels his latter target to a fault, as so many scenes involve three guys fixing their gazes upward to admire whatever existential madness tumbles from their mouths.A shame, because ""A Scanner Darkly"" wastes a decent Keanu Reeves  as a conflicted narcotics cop named Fred, who wears a ""scramble suit"" - an ever-shifting hologram of a million different faces - to disguise his identity from other narcs; in Dick's alternate future, cops are undercover to the whole world. Among junkies he's shiftless addict Bob Arctor, who happens to own a house that his two equally drug-fried buds Barris (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Luckman (Woody Harrelson) can reside in.Fred/Bob is trying to find the source of a powerful, destructive hallucinogen called Substance D, while taking D trips of his own. Couple the effects of ecstasy with heroin's addictive vice grip and you've got the tiny red caplets that Fred's girlfriend Donna (Winona Ryder, underused) seems to have in such great supply. Where's she get it? Why's she in the police database, but not in jail? Why does Bob imagine her after he's had sex with another woman? Is it the D, or something else?The answers are elusive until the final scenes, which try to give ""A Scanner Darkly"" some heart and  take tardy aim at capitalism with half-hearted liberal vigor. By then too much of the movie has been given over to the word games of Downey - few actors are paid to be so effortlessly annoying - and his standard episodes of vaguely aggressive intellectual mania.

But to fully appreciate the movie, its best to have not read the book and have an open mind to the differences.The plot:  Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane) is covered in aphids. At least he thinks so.  Freck hangs out with Barris (Robert Downey Jr.) and Luckman (Woody Harrelson) and Bob Arctor's girlfriend Donna (Winona Ryder).What Bob's roommates don't know is that there is more to Bob than his trivial job and his addiction. Bob Arctor is a narc called Fred (both played by Keanu Reeves), working for the Narcotics Division undercover. Whenever Fred enters the station to report, he wears a ""scramble suit"", so that he can't be identified. All narcotics officers wear them. When Fred is assigned to stake out his own identity in the drug world - Bob Arctor - things begin to fall apart for him.At first, Fred finds it ironic that he is staking out himself, but as the drug corrodes his brain, literally splitting the hemispheres apart, Bob/Fred separate and reality twists into shivering fibers of uncertainty. Barris and Luckman start to behave strangely.What will happen to Bob/Fred if he doesn't stop using Substance D? Why is Donna so standoffish if she likes Bob as much as she claims to? How deep can Bob/Fred go before something snaps inside his head? Or has it snapped already?'A Scanner Darkly' is classic the author Philip K. D!ck. In his book, P.K.D. vividly paints the funnier antics of substance abuse, and the tragedies that follow. The conversations between the men when they are high are both pathetic and hilarious. It's pretty obvious the author had some experience walking the pretty path of flowering hallucinations.In the movie, the dialogue fails a bit from P.K.D.'s formula.  It's harsher rather than poetic, as if to be more easily understood.  There's also limited time to bring the viewer into the world P.K.D. painted in the book.A highpoint of the movie is the way it was filmed with real actors and then painted over to appear animated.  This worked extremely good to portray the ""scramble suits"".  It also lends itself to the surreal world-view of the addicted.  There's plenty of deception, and an ending that will leave you a bit surprised.Overall, even if you've read the book and loved it, give the movie a try.  My recommendation is to rent before buying.  Enjoy!(My apologies on altering the name of the author, Philip K.

Heckenlively,"[0, 0]","""Are you watching closely?"" -- Alfred Borden, ""The Prestige""Scanner Darkly is one of those movies that didn't connect with me,didn't assert its reality, until about the last 15 minutes.And when it turned into ""Whoa"", it wasn't about plot twists ormental coruscations, it was about the characters as individuals,and their emotions. This movie has a heart.Part of it for me was watching the 1st half one night, and the 2ndhalf the next night. That allowed me to watch the Commentary rightafter the movie, which pointed out a great deal of detail and nuance.There's a lot more going on in this movie than just Rotoscoping.I haven't read the book, nor any of PKD's work, except 1 short story,a long long time ago, which I still vividly remember. So for me,background on PKD provided by his daughter in the Commentary is great.Scanner Darkly has, believe it or not, a lot of autobiographical aspects.Some of the choices he made, and some of the voice-over, is wrenching.The Commentary therefor speaks directly to PKD's visionary insights andperspectives on what seems like a fairly mundane, boring world he livedin then, and we live in today. And make no mistake, his vision appliesas much today, if not more so, than back then. Its highly topical, andthe Commentary gets into this topical aspect in good detail.For fans of Keanu Reeves, and the other stars here, I think this isexcellent work by the actors, but in order to appreciate their work,you have to find your connection with the movie. It takes a littleeffort, but its highly worthwhile.As I write this, there are blurbs about a mega-budget movie Reeves isin, ""47 Ronin"". Some say its his big comeback from the Matrix. ButScanner Darkly shows that Reeves took a very challenging role in a verydifferent kind of movie, and he performed superbly. In the end, Reevesbrings Bob Arctor up to the same tragic/heroic level as Neo Anderson:---  ""A present for my friends, at Thanksgiving.""  ---And the same holds true for all the stars. In such a vision-heavystory, they all bring the acting up to the level necessary to make thecharacters come alive. Subtle sometimes, vivid other times. Superb.Scanner Darkly is the kind of movie where I wonder why it didn't sell$150-200 million at the box office, like, say, ""Limitless"".

""A Scanner Darkly"" didn't have that effect on me, I was somehow engrossed in the story, watching along as Keanu Reeves went through some mind-tripping counter agent narc activities. It wasn't quite as intense as ""Rush"", but the mind-trippiness was engaging for a while.

Wynona Ryder, however, was hotter than ever as a digital chick who does too much coke.

Dick finally gets the treatment he deserves. A highly manufactured artefact: after filming it took 18 months to animate. The excellent acting shines through the well drawn craftsmanship.The surveillance society with the lubrication of paranoia fuelled the machine of Nixon's America, which Dick(whose home had been broken into and papers taken)was the subject of, often high on amphetamines. The loss of civil liberties can be updated to our own times to protect us from terrorism.Truth becomes relative and multiperspectival. We see the collapse of identity and brain cells under the onslaught of substance D. This layered tapestry depicts the tragi-comedy of drug-fuelled psychosis, set subtly in the future. As with Carlos Casteneda's story it teaches us to hold firmly onto our objectivism less hands mouth teeth eyes mind go up in smoke. Do the scanners see into our hearts or into our heads Keanu Reaves' character asks. The unity of embodied intelligence is seen through a glass darkly and fractures into a million trips. Science fiction turned inwards was far more what Dick was about(forget Blade Runner, Total Recall & Minority Report). This film has far more in common with Gilliam's Fear & Loathing and Naked Lunch. See it on the big screen for the best effect. They've made films out of graphic comics and novels. Now a sci-fi novel has been transformed into a graphic animation. Welcome to the future.Of course if you've read the book you will also realize that the Newpath project which manufactures and distributes the all-pervasive Substance-D are trying to destroy people's identities so they can manipulate the whole population.

Though the quotation comes from Shakespeare which I didn't know at the time, I felt like I had discovered a unique book. This book was dear to Dick's heart and I felt having read many of his other novels and stories that this was his best. Now to Linklater: it is a faithful adaptation of the novel. Some parts are not there, but no matter.

The novel ASD was one of the last of Dick's works to remain unspoiled by a faithless adaptation for the screen.  Given Hollywood's track record with Dick, I thought this would probably suck.  Even more than his other works, ASD is subjective, hallucinatory, multiperspectival, and generally ill-fit to be told in a linear format with recognizable actors.  The animation seemed like a neat gimmick - just as it was in Linklater's ""Waking Life"" -but I didn't see how it could add anything to what I feel was a damn near perfect novel.  But it really works - the animation distances the viewer from the narrative, giving the film an unreliable, dreamlike quality.  This is a perfectly realized film that is 100% true to Dick's vision - and in some ways adds to it.Despite being paranoid and surreal in the extreme, Dick's book had an uncanny authenticity.  The characters are so believably messed-up and yet so sympathetic that the book is obviously a memoir, albeit one filtered through a very anguished mind.  The secret to the film's success is the way that the ensemble cast captures Dick's horrifyingly ambivalent relationship with drugs and life outside the law.  Everyone involved is exploring this same relationship on a extremely personal level.  Keanu Reeves and Woody Harrelson are both long-time advocates for marijuana legalization.  Robert Downey Jr.'s (sometimes brilliant) career has been stunted by narcotics, and Winona's embarrassing shoplifting arrest seems to have sidetracked her a bit as well.  Their collective life-experience clearly informs this very emotionally-complicated presentation.  Like Dick's book, the film simultaneously glorifies and condemns drugs, the law, and the industries of recovery.  In this, Linklater and his actors capture both Dick's nihilistic humor and his compassion for the people victimized by the substance, the cops, and each other.",5,Perfectly realized,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,1947,"['When', 'heard', 'project', 'was', 'extremely', 'skeptical', 'novel', 'ASD', 'was', 'one', 'last', 'Dick', 'works', 'remain', 'unspoiled', 'faithless', 'adaptation', 'screen', 'Given', 'Hollywood', 'track', 'record', 'Dick', 'thought', 'would', 'probably', 'suck', 'Even', 'more', 'other', 'works', 'ASD', 'subjective', 'hallucinatory', 'multiperspectival', 'generally', 'ill-fit', 'be', 'told', 'linear', 'format', 'recognizable', 'actors', 'animation', 'seemed', 'neat', 'gimmick', 'just', 'was', 'Linklater', 'Waking', 'Life', '-but', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'could', 'add', 'anything', 'what', 'feel', 'was', 'damn', 'perfect', 'novel', 'really', 'animation', 'viewer', 'narrative', 'giving', 'film', 'unreliable', 'dreamlike', 'quality', 'perfectly', 'realized', 'film', '100', '%', 'true', 'Dick', 'vision', 'ways', 'it.Despite', 'being', 'paranoid', 'surreal', 'extreme', 'Dick', 'book', 'had', 'uncanny', 'authenticity', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'believably', 'messed-up', 'yet', 'so', 'sympathetic', 'book', 'obviously', 'memoir', 'one', 'filtered', 'very', 'anguished', 'mind', 'secret', 'film', 'success', 'way', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Dick', 'horrifyingly', 'ambivalent', 'relationship', 'drugs', 'life', 'law', 'Everyone', 'involved', 'exploring', 'same', 'relationship', 'extremely', 'personal', 'level', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'are', 'long-time', 'advocates', 'marijuana', 'legalization', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'sometimes', 'brilliant', 'career', 'been', 'stunted', 'narcotics', 'Winona', 'embarrassing', 'shoplifting', 'arrest', 'have', 'sidetracked', 'bit', 'as', 'well', 'collective', 'life-experience', 'clearly', 'very', 'emotionally-complicated', 'presentation', 'Dick', 'book', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'glorifies', 'condemns', 'drugs', 'law', 'industries', 'recovery', 'Linklater', 'actors', 'capture', 'Dick', 'nihilistic', 'humor', 'compassion', 'people', 'victimized', 'substance', 'cops', 'other']",N/A

1028925,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000JMK6LW,Tom Birkenstock,"[0, 0]","My favorite Philip K. Dick adaptation is Blade Runner. It's one of those adaptations that should never have worked. Ridley Scott's Deckard has little to do with the book's Deckard, only the skeletal outline of the plot is similar, and many of the assumptions and theories of the book are actually countered by the film. In the book the replicants lack any empathy towards other creatures and are never given a chance at redemption, while in the film the replicants are built without empathy but are given a chance to obtain it. What makes the film work is because it still understands the themes of the book even if it does not agree with them. That and because it's the most visually unique film...well, perhaps ever.A Scanner Darkly is the opposite of Blade Runner in that it is the most faithful Philip K. Dick adaptation...well, perhaps ever. This isn't a film that takes Philip K. Dick's ideas and dresses them up in some inane thriller, this is a Philip K. Dick book on the screen. The plot is largely absent from much of the film. Instead it focuses on the drugged out characters, and anyone who's hung out around the perpetually stoned will recognize one or two of these stoner archetypes. Of particular note is Robert Downey Jr. doing another great character since his rehab. What the hell Downey, I thought all creativity was supposed to be used up by the time you go through rehab? It's only until the second half of the movie that the plot twists start a-flyin'. If, like me, you've already read the book, then you'll want to go for the great character interaction, already on the page, brought to life by the aforementioned Downey, Woody Harrelson, and Rory Cochrane (who I was unfamiliar with, but does a great job at portraying a paranoid, nerve frayed druggie). You'll also want to check out the great use of rotoscoping. I was surprised to learn a few months back that this was the same technique used in those 1940 Superman cartoon shorts. I guess everything old is new.There are a few tweaks to the story line that make it slightly more relevant in today's world, but I was surprised how little needed to be changed for Dick's social commentary to shine through. It's interesting how time tested political maneuverings remain relevent. The use of an enemy to annex more power is the oldest trick in the book, but people keep on falling for it. Again and again governments will sing the refrain of protection to eat away at the Bill of Rights. In Dick's time it was protection against communism and the drug war. The drug war has been a good standby for years but it has recently been eclipsed by the war on terror. The drug war, terrorism, communism, Eurasia, Eastasia - governments will always create an enemy to make a power grab. Scanner paints a picture of a world where surveillance is so prevalent that the almost humorous situation of spying on yourself arises. Of course, one can ask the question about how many liberties we can give up to save ""America"" until we have actually destroyed the great experimental ideal of America our founding fathers hoped to create.As with most Philip K. Dick, the shifting nature of reality is examined, but in Scanner this reality isn't necessarily metaphysical as it is perceived (potential spoiler alert). Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves) volunteers to go undercover in order to find the higher up drug dealers, but is unaware that his superiors have a second undercover operation in mind. While he did volunteer in a broad sense for undercover anti-drug work, and that is still what his superiors are using him for (albeit not in a way he expected), he did not volunteer specifically for the dehumanizing fate that would accompany this second undercover drug scheme. I am reminded of the soldiers sent to Iraq under the assumption that Saddam was related to 9/11 (as asserted by the President on several occasions and, interesting enough, repeated by commanders at Abu Graib prisons). However, once they arrived in Iraq the reasons for going there were switched around. There were no WMDs or 9/11 connection, and instead they realize they are there for two major reasons: oil and a nave neo-conservative view of the world that believed toppling Saddam would make democracy flourish and solve the Middle East's problems. (We can all see how that is turning out). Scanner portrays how easy it is for politicians to switch reality on the public once they have what they want.Perhaps the next question is whether or not people even recognize that they were sold one war and given another. We live in a world where we're subject to a constant barrage of images everyday, and it means little to our mindset to go from a news anchor's somber description of an Iraq massacre to a commercial about Depends. If our minds can make these extreme leaps, perhaps it's not too difficult to think that what we believe one minute does not have to coincide with what we believe the next minute. To push the Iraq analogy, many people have no problem that they shouted WMDs at the top of their lungs before the war and democratization after the war without skipping a beat, and even claiming that democratization was their reason we should invade Iraq to begin with. It's only a matter of time before people start claiming that the only way to protect civil liberties is to destroy them.As you can see, A Scanner Darkly is one of those films you go and see late at night with a few of your friends, and then go get some coffee afterwards to talk about it.

1028927,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000JMK6LW,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","As I have not read Philip K. Dick's original novel, I just don't know how much Richard Linklater's adaptation of ""A Scanner Darkly"" is faithful to the book. All I could feel during the 100 minutes is 1) impressive visuals; 2) exceptional acting from Robert Downey Jr. (exceptional as his face is processed by rotoscoping animation - whatever that is) and 3) its very bleak view of the world. The last part is the most important for you're not going to see ""Total Recall"" or ""Minority Report.""I know this film is not about the story, which sometimes loses its track among the flood of dazzling images, but I think I should write about it. Keanu Reeves is an undercover cop Bob Arctor whose job is to spy on the group of addicts including Barris (Robert Downey Jr), Ernie (Woody Harrelson), Freck (Rory Cochrane) and Donna (Winona Ryder), to whom, it is suggested, Bob is romantically attracted.What makes this situation of the film more confusing is that Bob himself is addicted to illegal substance called Substance D. Bob is often unsure of what he is saying and seeing, and finally finds himself on the verge of breakdown. The impending danger is enhanced by the animation technique that has mid-boggling effects, and was also amazing in ""Waking Life.""Though some viewers would love the film for its mind-bending visuals, others may find it hard to understand what is going on. I happen to belong to the latter group of audiences and that is one of the reasons for my giving only three stars to `A Scanner Darkly."" Director Richard Linklater seems not particularly interested in making the narrative more accessible, and though I was impressed with the rotoscoping animation, painting digitally the face of professional actors may not always be the best idea for filmmakers because it deprives them of the nuance of their acting. (Still the unstoppable energy of Robert Downey Jr. can be felt through his animated face, which is surprising.)In short ""A Scanner Darkly"" has hypnotic visuals (including the special camouflage suit that makes the wearer's face constantly change) with a very disorienting narrative.

1028928,A5X1B2HBQUR3P,B000JMK6LW,"Vikram Ramanathan ""Live to Learn""","[1, 1]","As a long time fan of Phillip K Dick, I was very pleased my this movie. The biggest reason I liked this movie was that this movie was mostly true to  the spirit of the book. A scanner darkly is a cult classic among PKD fans. Man in high castle, Scanner Darkly, and Ubik are notable PKD classics that  came to mind. This is possibly the first major full length book of PKD work to be brought to film that is considered a winner in the print form as  well. For eg Total recall, Minority report, Blade runner (Do androids dream of electic sheep), pay check...all of these were actually short stories.  Minority report and blade runner being good adaptations. Scanner Darkly is a whole novel so there was already lot of source material from the book.  Hollywood did not have to add padding to a short story to make it into a movie.The rotoscopic animation works. It took like months to shoot the real movie and then 18 months to animate. Lof of time and manhours. It took them like  300 manhours to get a minute of animation. This animation works. But I wonder would the movie have been a better and bigger hit had it been made a  proper movie. Like it would have had this blade runner cult feel to it. It might have gone down as a classic. Animation allows a lot to be done and  possibly from a budget perspective, it may be more sound financially to do the animation rather than do cgi effects for a real life movie, but I can't  help but feel that it might have gone down as a real cult film.That being said, the animation is real cool. They basically drew it over the real life images. So basically they had a full length movie which they  shot and then drew over each frame. It's kind of like undoing the fim or doing 2 films back to back, first in reel and then on the computer. The  special features has a ""making of"" which features the rehearsels and script reads of the actors. It focuses more the real shooting. And then there is  a section on the ""animiation""  behind the movie which feature a 50 member animation crew and interviews with line drawing lead, the graphics artists,  the story board artists, animation guys from video game projects, etc. Movie and feature is good. This movie gets a recommendation for a rent for a  lay man and a buy recommendation for a PKD fan who is in awe of his SF books.regards, Vikram",5,Movie was mostly true to  the spirit of the book.,1195689600,"11 22, 2007",2007,2329,"['long', 'time', 'fan', 'Phillip', 'K', 'Dick', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'movie', 'biggest', 'reason', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'mostly', 'true', 'spirit', 'book', 'scanner', 'darkly', 'cult', 'classic', 'PKD', 'fans', 'Man', 'high', 'castle', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'Ubik', 'are', 'notable', 'PKD', 'classics', 'came', 'mind', 'possibly', 'first', 'major', 'full', 'length', 'book', 'PKD', 'work', 'be', 'brought', 'film', 'considered', 'winner', 'print', 'form', 'as', 'well', 'eg', 'Total', 'recall', 'Minority', 'report', 'Blade', 'runner', 'Do', 'androids', 'dream', 'electic', 'sheep', 'pay', 'check', 'were', 'actually', 'short', 'stories', 'Minority', 'report', 'blade', 'runner', 'being', 'good', 'adaptations', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'whole', 'novel', 'so', 'there', 'was', 'already', 'lot', 'source', 'material', 'book', 'Hollywood', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'add', 'padding', 'short', 'story', 'make', 'movie.The', 'rotoscopic', 'animation', 'took', 'like', 'months', 'shoot', 'real', 'movie', 'then', '18', 'months', 'animate', 'Lof', 'time', 'manhours', 'took', '300', 'manhours', 'get', 'minute', 'animation', 'animation', 'wonder', 'would', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'bigger', 'hit', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'proper', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'blade', 'runner', 'cult', 'feel', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'classic', 'Animation', 'lot', 'be', 'done', 'possibly', 'budget', 'perspective', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'sound', 'financially', 'do', 'animation', 'rather', 'do', 'cgi', 'effects', 'real', 'life', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'down', 'real', 'cult', 'film.That', 'being', 'said', 'animation', 'real', 'cool', 'basically', 'drew', 'real', 'life', 'images', 'So', 'basically', 'had', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'shot', 'then', 'drew', 'frame', 'kind', 'undoing', 'fim', 'doing', '2', 'films', 'back', 'back', 'first', 'reel', 'then', 'computer', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'rehearsels', 'script', 'reads', 'actors', 'more', 'real', 'shooting', 'then', 'section', 'animiation', 'movie', 'feature', '50', 'member', 'animation', 'crew', 'interviews', 'line', 'drawing', 'lead', 'graphics', 'artists', 'story', 'board', 'animation', 'guys', 'video', 'game', 'projects', 'etc', 'Movie', 'feature', 'good', 'movie', 'recommendation', 'rent', 'lay', 'man', 'buy', 'recommendation', 'PKD', 'fan', 'who', 'awe', 'SF', 'books.regards', 'Vikram']",N/A

1028930,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000JMK6LW,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[3, 5]","First and foremost this movie is tragic, dark, funny and moving with eye popping visuals in the form of the animation used to tell the story. It also doesn't the usual science fiction escapist fare that moviegoers usually get. It's much closer to the more serious side of the genre. It won't be for everyone.Set ""7 Years from now"" ""A Scanner Darkly"" seems more topical now than when the novel came out in 1977; undercover police officers use Scrambler Suits to hide their identity (it makes them look like everyone and no one--it's a very cool looking effect)allowing them to try and infiltrate the drug world and keep their anonymity. The war on drugs has basically failed with 20% of the population addicted to a new nasty drug called Substance D that destroys the brain.By the way amazon.com listed the major fact I'm listing below without stating it as a spoiler but it does give away a signficant aspect of the plot.**Spoiler Below**Fred (Keanu Reeves) has been assigned to keep an eye on Bob Arcotor and his circle of friends. There's one problem--Fred IS Bob but doesn't realize it due to the ingestion of Substance D an illegal drug that Fred and other police officers use to be accepted by the drug users and dealers.**End Spoiler**The big question here--is the film good? Absolutely. Richard Linklater has done an outstanding job here and this is probably the most faithful film version of one of Dick's stories I've ever seen. ""Blade Runner"" managed to capture the themes and essence of Dick's original novel Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep? as well as the basic plot but in its own unique way. Linklater retains the major plot points (and major chucks of the novel as well) AND manages to create a unique looking film that captures Dick's sarcastic dark vision equally well.Extras: The most important one is the ""Making of"" featurette. It's a little less than 30 minutes but incorporates ALL of the major talents involved discussing the making of the film including Phil Dick in archival footage shot in 1977. It also has a brief excerpt of Dick reading from his novel and visually we see the footage before animation and after. It's a pretty cool featurette overall.Next we get a featurette on how the film was translated from digital video to digital coloring/animation via rotoscoping (where you trace over the original image and treat it like an animation cel creating a realistic looking cartoon as a result. This techinque began to achieve popularity with Max Fleischer and Disney in the 30's and 40's). It's a fascinating glimpse into seeing a film being changed from one format to another.The film looks terrific in its presentation here with nice extras (none of them fluff). The commentary track by director Linklater, his producer, Dick's daughter and Jonathn Lethem a Dick scholar/writer is full of fascinating tidbits although it takes a bit before it picks up steam. Overall this is a terrific film although not for everyone. This isn't escapist sci-fi but a harder edged dark look that's faithful to Dick's novel.",4,Dark indeed--this isn't escapist sci-fi stuff as it captures the flavor of Dick's original cautionary tale,1166572800,"12 20, 2006",2006,3045,"['First', 'foremost', 'movie', 'tragic', 'dark', 'funny', 'moving', 'eye', 'popping', 'visuals', 'form', 'animation', 'used', 'tell', 'story', 'also', ""n't"", 'usual', 'science', 'fiction', 'escapist', 'fare', 'moviegoers', 'usually', 'get', 'much', 'closer', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'genre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'everyone.Set', '7', 'Years', 'now', 'A', 'Scanner', 'Darkly', 'more', 'topical', 'now', 'when', 'novel', 'came', 'out', '1977', 'undercover', 'police', 'officers', 'use', 'Scrambler', 'Suits', 'hide', 'identity', 'look', 'everyone', 'one', 'very', 'cool', 'looking', 'effect', 'allowing', 'try', 'infiltrate', 'drug', 'world', 'keep', 'anonymity', 'war', 'drugs', 'basically', 'failed', '20', '%', 'population', 'addicted', 'new', 'nasty', 'drug', 'called', 'Substance', 'D', 'brain.By', 'way', 'amazon.com', 'listed', 'major', 'fact', ""'m"", 'listing', 'stating', 'spoiler', 'give', 'away', 'signficant', 'aspect', 'plot', '**Spoiler', 'Below**Fred', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'been', 'assigned', 'keep', 'eye', 'Bob', 'Arcotor', 'circle', 'friends', 'one', 'problem', 'Fred', 'IS', 'Bob', ""n't"", 'realize', 'due', 'ingestion', 'Substance', 'D', 'illegal', 'drug', 'Fred', 'other', 'police', 'officers', 'use', 'be', 'accepted', 'drug', 'users', 'dealers', '**End', 'Spoiler**The', 'big', 'question', 'here', 'film', 'good', 'Absolutely', 'Richard', 'Linklater', 'done', 'outstanding', 'job', 'here', 'probably', 'most', 'faithful', 'film', 'version', 'one', 'Dick', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'managed', 'capture', 'themes', 'essence', 'Dick', 'original', 'novel', 'Do', 'Android', 'Dream', 'Electric', 'Sheep', 'as', 'well', 'basic', 'plot', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'Linklater', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'major', 'chucks', 'novel', 'as', 'well', 'create', 'unique', 'looking', 'film', 'Dick', 'sarcastic', 'dark', 'vision', 'equally', 'most', 'important', 'one', 'Making', 'featurette', 'little', 'less', '30', 'minutes', 'major', 'talents', 'involved', 'discussing', 'making', 'film', 'including', 'Phil', 'Dick', 'archival', 'footage', 'shot', '1977', 'also', 'brief', 'excerpt', 'Dick', 'reading', 'novel', 'visually', 'see', 'footage', 'animation', 'pretty', 'cool', 'featurette', 'get', 'featurette', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'translated', 'digital', 'video', 'digital', 'coloring/animation', 'rotoscoping', 'where', 'trace', 'original', 'image', 'treat', 'animation', 'cel', 'creating', 'realistic', 'looking', 'cartoon', 'result', 'techinque', 'began', 'achieve', 'popularity', 'Max', 'Fleischer', 'Disney', '30', '40', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'seeing', 'film', 'being', 'changed', 'one', 'format', 'another.The', 'film', 'looks', 'terrific', 'presentation', 'here', 'nice', 'extras', 'none', 'fluff', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'Linklater', 'producer', 'Dick', 'daughter', 'Jonathn', 'Lethem', 'Dick', 'scholar/writer', 'full', 'fascinating', 'tidbits', 'bit', 'up', 'steam', 'Overall', 'terrific', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', ""n't"", 'escapist', 'sci-fi', 'harder', 'edged', 'dark', 'look', 'faithful', 'Dick', 'novel']",N/A
