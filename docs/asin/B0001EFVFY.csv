802593,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B0001EFVFY,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[1, 1]","This is the excruciatingly hilarious series from Ricky Gervaise - who wrote and stars in this as Officer Manager David ""The Brentmeister"" Brent. This is a mockumentary style series  which will have you alternately squirming in your seat and laughing out loud.This is a six part series (the second series of only two) which follows David Brent and the team at the Stationery company Werner Hogg Slough branch. They are due to be merged with Swindon branch and there may be layoffs. The office is bristling iwth rumours as it seems that people may be laid off - will they be from Swindon branch or Slough?Who will manage them all? This theme will be recognisable to all. In between it is business as usual - the same awful pettiness you get in any office, only caught on camera in and drawn out with excruciatingly funny/embarrassing detail.David Brent is completely unaware of his utter awfulness - his complete lack of humour and his extraodinary inability as a manager. However this is done with a subtle style - there is no laugh track, nothing is telegraphed - it is left the audience how to react to what is on screen.I think one of the reasons for its enormous success is the fact that I don't think there has been single person who has ever worked in an office and not met people like David Brent. And the office politics, gossip and romances well also be instantly recogniseable.Ricky Gervaise FABULOUS in the part, he does it so well! But he is ably supported by the main characters, Tim who yearns for the beautiful Dawn - and by the awful sidekick and Part time soldier/territorial Gareth.Highly recommended as teh best of British Humour!",5,Excruiciatingly funny - car-crash television which will have you squirming in your seat,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,1648,"['excruciatingly', 'hilarious', 'series', 'Ricky', 'Gervaise', 'who', 'wrote', 'stars', 'Officer', 'Manager', 'David', 'Brentmeister', 'Brent', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'series', 'will', 'have', 'alternately', 'squirming', 'seat', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud.This', 'six', 'part', 'series', 'second', 'series', 'only', 'two', 'David', 'Brent', 'team', 'Stationery', 'company', 'Werner', 'Hogg', 'Slough', 'branch', 'are', 'due', 'be', 'merged', 'Swindon', 'branch', 'may', 'be', 'layoffs', 'office', 'bristling', 'iwth', 'rumours', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'laid', 'off', 'will', 'be', 'Swindon', 'branch', 'Slough', 'Who', 'will', 'manage', 'theme', 'will', 'be', 'recognisable', 'business', 'usual', 'same', 'awful', 'pettiness', 'get', 'office', 'only', 'caught', 'camera', 'drawn', 'out', 'excruciatingly', 'funny/embarrassing', 'detail.David', 'Brent', 'completely', 'unaware', 'utter', 'awfulness', 'complete', 'lack', 'humour', 'extraodinary', 'inability', 'manager', 'However', 'done', 'subtle', 'style', 'laugh', 'track', 'nothing', 'telegraphed', 'left', 'audience', 'how', 'react', 'what', 'screen.I', 'think', 'one', 'reasons', 'enormous', 'success', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'single', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'worked', 'office', 'not', 'met', 'people', 'David', 'Brent', 'office', 'politics', 'gossip', 'romances', 'well', 'also', 'be', 'instantly', 'recogniseable.Ricky', 'Gervaise', 'FABULOUS', 'part', 'so', 'well', 'ably', 'supported', 'main', 'characters', 'Tim', 'who', 'beautiful', 'Dawn', 'awful', 'sidekick', 'Part', 'time', 'soldier/territorial', 'Gareth.Highly', 'recommended', 'teh', 'best', 'British', 'Humour']",N/A

The actors' expressiveness fills the awkward silences to great effect. Many real issues and themes about life, politics of sexuality, gender and of course, politics of work environments, are embedded within the plotlines, anecdotes and jokes. It's refreshing to watch a show this funny, where the structure and writing feel real, and do not insult the viewer's intelligence. Unfortunately, there are only two seasons in this series. From personal experience working in several urban offices, I think there's enough people with stories and situations out there, that the writers could have found more material and created one more strong season. On the other hand, the writers do a fabulous job with maintaining the integrity of the show. They  develop the stories and reveal the characters within the series in a seemingly natural progression.The story of David Brent becomes particularly juicy by season's end. Yes, it's not always making you laugh to form a queue by the lavatory. However, the humour is always smart and so unbelievable that it's completely believable. Ever Brilliant.

Ricky Gervais (the face of writing tandem) and Stephen Merchant have taken what could be considered the banal existence of a typical office worker and fused it with a lethal dose of British vernacular and behaviors. The results are glorious and riotous.The clever part about it all is that you dont have to be British to be able to identify with these characters or their personalities. Each character truely represents an individual that you know in your workplace. The documentary style really is where the genius lies, the overt acknowledgement of David's idiocy in the moment he glares at the camera are captured beautifully. David Brent (the lead character played by Gervais), unfortunately, begins a gradual descent into insanity and paranoia and isnt as vulnerable and loveable as you remembered him in the first series. I can assure you that you will at least laugh if youre not too busy going into hysterical convulsions on the floor.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[5, 5]","Everyone's favorite insane British office workers are back in the second series of &quot;the Office,&quot; England's short-lived but quite funny answer to &quot;Dilbert.&quot; While the second series isn't quite up to the standards of the first, it's still entertaining and bittersweetly wacky.At the end of the previous series, it was announced that the Swindon branch of Wernham-Hogg would be incorporated into the Slough branch. Now David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is boss of a bunch of new employees, and they're actually used to doing work. What's more, David finds himself competing with Neil (Patrick Baladi), who happens to be his new boss.More bizarre problems follow, starting when David starts making off-color, racist jokes at the welcoming party. A dildo is placed in David's office during a meeting. Then he goes to give a disastrous motivational speech, complete with a soundtrack. Tim (Martin Freeman) starts dating a pretty new employee, which inspires Dawn's (Lucy Davis) jealousy. Gareth (Mackenzie Crook) tries to score with every woman who doesn't curse at him. And finally, a comedy day turns bittersweet when Dawn says she's leaving, and David is given some bad news...Only a few shows -- like the immortal Brit comedy &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; -- end before they have a chance to go downhill, and &quot;The Office&quot; is one of those few. The series stops on a bittersweet note, with David's gradual deterioration, and the reality about Dawn crashing on Tim's head. But despite the darker note it ends on, it's still uproariously funny along the way.There's a reality-TV quality to the way this is filmed -- monotone workrooms, ringing phones, bored peons, worthless meetings. And there are plenty of funny moments -- the sex toy, Gareth's &quot;tight trousers&quot; phone call, the obscene Dirty Bertie doll, and Gareth hopping all over the office on one foot. Perhaps funniest is David's frenetic dance, which brings to mind a spastic monkey trying to scratch a back itch.The most unsettling part of the second season is the finale, especially since Tim's love for Dawn is dealt with in a rather disappointing manner. And the writing is a little more blatant than last season, especially since David is made even more obnoxious. But it's still laced with great humor, such as David's terrible poetry. &quot;Take this cool dark steeled blade/steal it, sheathe it in your lake/I'd drown with you to be together/Must you breathe?/'Cause I need heaven,&quot; he reads to the hapless Dawn.Ricky Gervais first makes us love to hate David, with his grotesque attempts at comedy, then does a 180 by making us feel sorry for him. This is a guy with great acting talent. Martin Freeman does a good job as everyman Tim, but often the scenes are stolen by the wonderfully corpse-like MacKenzie Crook, or Ewan Macintosh as the seemingly brain-dead Keith.&quot;The Office&quot; manages to be poignant and funny at the same time, which isn't an easy thing to do.

Ricky Gervais, the writer and star of the show, has come from relative obscurity, to make something that is so relevant to people today - not just in England, but around the world.Following on from the 1st series, the 2nd series sees a continuation of the fall of David Brent, allowing for some darker comedic moments. The romance between Tim and Dawn continues, will true love ever prevail? But perhaps the highlight of the 2nd series is David Brent moving onto the consultancy circuit and becoming a motivational speaker. Slough did not know what it got itself in for....and as he walks out on the stunned group to the strains of Tina Turners `Simply the best' you will really start to appreciate why this series has slowly made the world sit up and take notice.With just 2 Christmas episodes left before this show is forever consigned to the repeats channels, I strongly advise you to enjoy it now while it is fresh - this is the Fawlty Towers of our generation.The extras that come with the DVD are also well worth viewing, it is a total package.",5,Get it now!,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,1417,"['2nd', 'series', 'Office', 'everything', 'made', 'first', 'series', 'so', 'popular', 'currently', 'biggest', 'selling', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'time', 'series', 'superb', 'quality.For', 'not', 'aware', 'humour', 'show', 'cringe', 'worthy', 'times', 'insight', 'real', 'peoples', 'emotions', 'weaknesses', 'show', 'so', 'appealing', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'writer', 'star', 'show', 'come', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'make', 'something', 'so', 'relevant', 'people', 'today', 'not', 'just', 'England', 'world.Following', '1st', 'series', '2nd', 'series', 'continuation', 'fall', 'David', 'Brent', 'allowing', 'darker', 'comedic', 'moments', 'romance', 'Tim', 'Dawn', 'will', 'true', 'love', 'ever', 'prevail', 'perhaps', 'highlight', '2nd', 'series', 'David', 'Brent', 'moving', 'consultancy', 'circuit', 'becoming', 'motivational', 'speaker', 'Slough', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'got', '.and', 'out', 'stunned', 'group', 'strains', 'Tina', 'Turners', 'Simply', 'best', 'will', 'really', 'start', 'appreciate', 'why', 'series', 'slowly', 'made', 'world', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice.With', 'just', '2', 'Christmas', 'episodes', 'left', 'show', 'forever', 'consigned', 'repeats', 'channels', 'strongly', 'advise', 'enjoy', 'now', 'fresh', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'generation.The', 'extras', 'come', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'total', 'package']",N/A

Granted, one needs a dark and often dry sense of humor to enjoy this, but it is funny. But somehow, it did ultimately feel like the show's legs started to tire at toward the end, and began to fall back on Ricky Gervais's willingness to do anything in front of the camera.I realize this review has a very negative tone for one ranking it so highly, but as time has gone by, I have not often popped this disc into my DVD player, though I have gone back many times to Season 1.
