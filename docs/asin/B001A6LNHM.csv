I was glad to find this CD for a good price. For anyone unfamiliar with the movie's general plot,  I'd recommend the Internet Movie Data Base site (imdb) for a general idea.  The CD was in good condition - packaged to protect the merchandise and in a normal plastic case.  I haven't watched Rob Roy yet.

Both films are the get even sort, as far as story lines go, and both showcase some beautiful nature scenery. Big name actors and actresses play in both the films.
