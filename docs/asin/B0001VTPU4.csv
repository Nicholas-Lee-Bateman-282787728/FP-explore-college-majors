Nigel Terry, as in Excalibur&#34; is handsome and acts really well. Shelley Winters is excellent. Claire Bloom, in a small role as the mother of Jaclyn Smith, is very good. The film is from 1985 and is quite good.",5,D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu with great actors!,1380499200,"09 30, 2013",2013,342,"['liked', 'movie', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'interesting', 'actors', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'beautiful', 'dual', 'role', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'Excalibur', '34', 'handsome', 'really', 'well', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'excellent', 'Claire', 'Bloom', 'small', 'role', 'mother', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'very', 'good', 'film', '1985', 'quite', 'good']",Deja Vu

814821,AAP2RANG3TTSM,B0001VTPU4,"Rodney Bogardus ""piscean dream""","[17, 17]","I rented this film based on its plot description, with moderate expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was!Nigel Terry is superb in his portrayal of a writer-going-mad and it is always wonderful to see Charlie's Angel Jaclyn Smith on the screen. Both actors play dual roles-- Smith is &quot;Maggie&quot;, an actress in the present (the mid-1980's) and &quot;Brooke&quot;, an acclaimed ballerina in the flashback sequences (the mid-1930's); Terry is &quot;Greg&quot;, a writer in the present, and &quot;Michael&quot; a wealthy choreographer who works and falls in love with &quot;Brooke&quot;. The two stories are joined by Greg's fascination with Maggie's uncanny resemblance to Brooke and the mysterious death of Michael and Brooke.As soon as Greg begins researching the facts around the events that took place 50 years earlier, with the help of Shelly Winters as &quot;Olga&quot;, a hypnotist and psychic, he soon discovers that he is Michael reincarnated, and that Maggie is... reincarnated herself! Does she possess the spirit of Brooke? Or someone entirely different? (You'll have to watch it to see!)All of the actors give a fine performance, and the set and costume designers do a fantastic distinguishing between the two time periods of the film. All of which takes place in beautiful England. DEJA VU is a multi-genre film-- part love story and part mystery/suspense-- and it is executed in an almost Hitchcockian manner by giving the audience the right amount of information to intrigue them, without ever completely explaing every detail. If you're a viewer who doesn't like to make your own conclusions, then this may not be a film for you; but for those of you who appreciate this style of storytelling, then watch this today!",5,A Pleasant Surprise!!!,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,1765,"['rented', 'film', 'based', 'plot', 'description', 'moderate', 'expectations', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'superb', 'portrayal', 'writer-going-mad', 'always', 'wonderful', 'see', 'Charlie', 'Angel', 'Jaclyn', 'Smith', 'screen', 'actors', 'play', 'dual', 'roles', 'Smith', 'quot', 'Maggie', 'quot', 'actress', 'present', 'mid-1980', 'quot', 'Brooke', 'quot', 'acclaimed', 'ballerina', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'mid-1930', 'Terry', 'quot', 'Greg', 'quot', 'writer', 'present', 'quot', 'Michael', 'quot', 'wealthy', 'choreographer', 'who', 'love', 'quot', 'Brooke', 'quot', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'joined', 'Greg', 'fascination', 'Maggie', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'Brooke', 'mysterious', 'death', 'Michael', 'Brooke.As', 'soon', 'Greg', 'researching', 'facts', 'events', 'took', 'place', '50', 'years', 'earlier', 'help', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'quot', 'Olga', 'quot', 'hypnotist', 'psychic', 'soon', 'Michael', 'reincarnated', 'Maggie', 'reincarnated', 'possess', 'spirit', 'Brooke', 'someone', 'entirely', 'different', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'actors', 'give', 'fine', 'performance', 'set', 'costume', 'designers', 'do', 'fantastic', 'distinguishing', 'two', 'time', 'periods', 'film', 'place', 'beautiful', 'England', 'DEJA', 'VU', 'multi-genre', 'film', 'part', 'love', 'story', 'part', 'mystery/suspense', 'executed', 'almost', 'Hitchcockian', 'manner', 'giving', 'audience', 'right', 'amount', 'information', 'intrigue', 'ever', 'completely', 'explaing', 'detail', ""'re"", 'viewer', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'make', 'own', 'conclusions', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'film', 'who', 'appreciate', 'style', 'storytelling', 'then', 'watch', 'today']",Deja Vu
