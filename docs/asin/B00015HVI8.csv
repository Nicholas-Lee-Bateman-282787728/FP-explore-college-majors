793448,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B00015HVI8,A. Burchfield,"[15, 47]","This one makes six straight seasons of good Science Fiction televison. While Daniel Jackson is mostly gone now, replaced by Jonas Quinn, the stories generally still manage to achieve a high level of just about everything.I liked the Osiris and Thor bits, and I thought ""The Other Guys"" was a bit too silly (it had a few Star Trek joke bits and Enterprises John Billingsley was a guest). The Air Force starship ""Prometheus"" was ridiculous becasue it would take far too many years to design and build such a massive object(It's only been about 7 years or so since Earth first ran into the Goa'uld, you'd need more time than that just to understand the technology let alone even think of using it)The best parts of the episode ""Descent"" were the water scenes in which Carter and O'Neill almost drown in a corridor (that was a specially built set made up to be sunk in a deep pool)and the one in which Jonas must do a little underwater circuit work to save them.""Frozen"" was one of my favorite episodes ;the body of a woman is found frozen in ice in Antarctica not far from the location of the second Stargate found on Earth. She revives during the thawing process and is determined to be from Earth's distant past, probably one of the Ancient races that really did build the Stargate system. Unfortunately she's infected with some virus, alomst kills everyone in the lab. In the end she saves them but dies in the process. O'Neill can't be saved so the Tok'ra take him away to be, grudgingly, temporarily implanted with a symbiote. The next episode ""Abyss"" was a sequel to this one, and was pretty sloppy in some ways, it did have Daniel Jackson appearing to O'Neill to help him out.As always you've got O'Neill's humorous/ dumb commentary in each episode, sometimes that guy can seem too stupid for the job.",4,Kind of a mixed bag but still very good TV,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,1805,"['one', 'six', 'straight', 'seasons', 'good', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'televison', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'mostly', 'gone', 'now', 'replaced', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'stories', 'generally', 'still', 'manage', 'achieve', 'high', 'level', 'just', 'everything.I', 'liked', 'Osiris', 'Thor', 'bits', 'thought', 'Other', 'Guys', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'had', 'few', 'Star', 'Trek', 'joke', 'bits', 'Enterprises', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'was', 'guest', 'Air', 'Force', 'starship', 'Prometheus', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'becasue', 'would', 'take', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'years', 'design', 'build', 'such', 'massive', 'object', 'only', 'been', '7', 'years', 'so', 'Earth', 'first', 'ran', ""Goa'uld"", ""'d"", 'need', 'more', 'time', 'just', 'understand', 'technology', 'let', 'alone', 'even', 'think', 'using', 'best', 'parts', 'episode', 'Descent', 'were', 'water', 'scenes', 'Carter', ""O'Neill"", 'almost', 'drown', 'corridor', 'was', 'specially', 'built', 'set', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'sunk', 'deep', 'pool', 'one', 'Jonas', 'must', 'do', 'little', 'underwater', 'circuit', 'work', 'save', 'Frozen', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'body', 'woman', 'found', 'frozen', 'ice', 'Antarctica', 'not', 'far', 'location', 'second', 'Stargate', 'found', 'Earth', 'thawing', 'process', 'determined', 'be', 'Earth', 'distant', 'past', 'probably', 'one', 'Ancient', 'races', 'really', 'did', 'build', 'Stargate', 'system', 'Unfortunately', 'infected', 'virus', 'alomst', 'kills', 'everyone', 'lab', 'end', 'process', ""O'Neill"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved', 'so', ""Tok'ra"", 'take', 'away', 'be', 'grudgingly', 'temporarily', 'implanted', 'symbiote', 'next', 'episode', 'Abyss', 'was', 'sequel', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'sloppy', 'ways', 'did', 'have', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'appearing', ""O'Neill"", 'help', 'out.As', 'always', ""'ve"", 'got', ""O'Neill"", 'humorous/', 'dumb', 'commentary', 'episode', 'sometimes', 'guy', 'can', 'seem', 'too', 'stupid', 'job']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

793456,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00015HVI8,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[6, 15]","After the Season 5 debacle, I was unsure about what to expect with Stargate SG-1's sixth season.  I was afraid that year 4 would be the peak and that the show ""jumped the shark"" in Season 5.  Fortunately, that was not the case.  Hopefully, the mediocrity (if that's a word) of last year was an isolated incident.Anyway, the season begins with SG-1 still trying to find a fourth man.  Ever since the death/ascension of Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), they have been unable to find a suitable replacement.  Refugee Jonas Quinn (Corinn Nemec) has expressed a desire to join, but Col. O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) never seemed to warm up to the idea.  Also, Anubis (David Paffly) has found a machine created by the Ancients that uses one stargate to destroy another, and he used it to attempt to destroy Earth.  Using the new X-302, a craft capable of aerial combat and intersellar travel, O'Neill successfully avoids disaster, but the Antarctica gate is destroyed.  After that, we don't see Anubis for a while, but the threat of his powers is always hanging over the heads of the SGC.Anyway, with Jonas as the new member of SG-1, the team embarks on another year of amazing missions.  This year, we see the end of the exiled System Lord Niirti, known for her attempts to create a superior human host through genetic experimentation, we are introduced to some technology of the Furlings, one of the members of the intergalactic UN group who rallied against the goa'uld, Earth's first interstellar capital ship, Prometheus is unvailed, the Replicator threat is ended (I think), and, in one of my favorite episodes, Gen. Hammond (Don S. Davis) discloses the existence of the SGC to representitives of the UK, France, and China.This year did have a few problems, but the season as a whole made up for them.  Some great episodes include ""Redemption Pts. 1 and 2"", ""Descent"", ""Nightwalkers"", ""Abyss"", ""Shadow Play"", ""Allegiance"", ""Prometheus"", ""Unnatural Selection"", ""Smoke and Mirrors"", ""Disclosure"", ""The Changeling"", and ""Full Circle"", the best episode of the season.",5,Quality Season,1086480000,"06 6, 2004",2004,2065,"['Season', '5', 'debacle', 'was', 'unsure', 'what', 'expect', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'sixth', 'season', 'was', 'afraid', 'year', '4', 'would', 'be', 'peak', 'show', 'jumped', 'shark', 'Season', '5', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Hopefully', 'mediocrity', 'word', 'last', 'year', 'was', 'isolated', 'incident.Anyway', 'season', 'SG-1', 'still', 'trying', 'find', 'fourth', 'man', 'Ever', 'death/ascension', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'have', 'been', 'unable', 'find', 'suitable', 'replacement', 'Refugee', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'Corinn', 'Nemec', 'expressed', 'desire', 'join', 'Col.', ""O'Neill"", 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'never', 'seemed', 'warm', 'up', 'idea', 'Also', 'Anubis', 'David', 'Paffly', 'found', 'machine', 'created', 'Ancients', 'one', 'stargate', 'destroy', 'used', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'Earth', 'Using', 'new', 'X-302', 'craft', 'capable', 'aerial', 'combat', 'intersellar', 'travel', ""O'Neill"", 'successfully', 'disaster', 'Antarctica', 'gate', 'destroyed', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Anubis', 'while', 'threat', 'powers', 'always', 'hanging', 'heads', 'SGC.Anyway', 'Jonas', 'new', 'member', 'SG-1', 'team', 'year', 'amazing', 'missions', 'year', 'see', 'end', 'exiled', 'System', 'Lord', 'Niirti', 'known', 'attempts', 'create', 'superior', 'human', 'host', 'genetic', 'experimentation', 'are', 'introduced', 'technology', 'Furlings', 'one', 'members', 'intergalactic', 'UN', 'group', 'who', 'rallied', ""goa'uld"", 'Earth', 'first', 'interstellar', 'capital', 'ship', 'Prometheus', 'unvailed', 'Replicator', 'threat', 'ended', 'think', 'one', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'Gen.', 'Hammond', 'Don', 'S.', 'Davis', 'existence', 'SGC', 'representitives', 'UK', 'France', 'China.This', 'year', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'season', 'whole', 'made', 'up', 'great', 'episodes', 'include', 'Redemption', 'Pts', '1', '2', 'Descent', 'Nightwalkers', 'Abyss', 'Shadow', 'Play', 'Allegiance', 'Prometheus', 'Unnatural', 'Selection', 'Smoke', 'Mirrors', 'Disclosure', 'Changeling', 'Full', 'Circle', 'best', 'episode', 'season']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

Season 6 is still in the midst of the height of the show with good seasons ahead.  It definitely hit a point at which to much change left long term fans falling away, but Season 6 is still a ways away from reaching that point.  The show started a franchise of shows based on the strength of some of those long running story lines and sometimes crossed the line of how much could be kept secret in the information age, but just because a few stories didn't develop that I would have liked to have will not diminish the quality of the show and its long run.  I think season 8 levels off and 9 and 10 are where the decline actually occurs, but I have to re-watch them to assess them.  My opinion is that 6 is still riding the crest of success and quality and the show remains strong for some time yet.",5,Season 6 still in the prime of the series,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",2014,1259,"['Season', '6', 'remains', 'peak', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'series', 'Characters', 'fully', 'developed', 'relations', 'are', 'dependable', 'know', 'will', 'fade', 'reappear', 'Stargate', 'had', 'luxury', 'long', 'good', 'run', 'based', 'multiple', 'tiered', 'storyline', 'unfold', 'Season', '6', 'apex', 'yet', 'come', 'decline', 'still', 'ahead', 'point', 'long', 'running', 'shows', 'fall', 'pattern', 'SG', 'had', 'successful', 'one', 'supported', 'long', 'good', 'run', 'Season', '6', 'still', 'midst', 'height', 'show', 'good', 'seasons', 'ahead', 'definitely', 'hit', 'point', 'much', 'change', 'left', 'long', 'term', 'fans', 'falling', 'away', 'Season', '6', 'still', 'ways', 'away', 'reaching', 'point', 'show', 'started', 'franchise', 'shows', 'based', 'strength', 'long', 'running', 'story', 'lines', 'sometimes', 'crossed', 'line', 'how', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'kept', 'secret', 'information', 'age', 'just', 'few', 'stories', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'will', 'not', 'diminish', 'quality', 'show', 'long', 'run', 'think', 'season', '8', 'levels', '9', '10', 'are', 'where', 'decline', 'actually', 'have', 're-watch', 'assess', 'opinion', '6', 'still', 'riding', 'crest', 'success', 'quality', 'show', 'strong', 'time', 'yet']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

In that episode, by the way, the Russians pass through the Stargate and still speak Russian. (If the stargate programmed one's speech, or language, to match the worlds to which it was connected, it should have made the Russians perfectly easy to understand once they had passed through its event horizon.) But the Russians couldn't communicate with the world's inhabitants while the Americans could.The best episodes were the ones with guest appearances by Michael Shanks.

I always search everywhere on the internet and try to get some advance notice about DVD releases.  As with the prior seasons, the format is Widescreen anamorphic - 1.78:1 and the audio is Dolby Digital 5.1. Disappointingly, MGM's site had very little information.  I especially wanted to find out what the ""Director Series"" is in the extras.  I could not find out too much.  Only one website had this description:  The Director Series features give insight into the working day of the director on issues such as script development, prop and set creation.Here is an episode guide, with a tiny description.1. Redemption - Part 1:  The Stargate malfunctions and threatens to destroy all life on Earth.2.

793483,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00015HVI8,Eric,"[10, 21]","Great sci-fi is a rarity these days, with too many TV shows (Andromeda, Farscape, the last three Star Trek series) boasting mediocre acting and writing, at best, to go along with admittedly impressive visuals and occasionally very intriguing concepts and plot strands.  Stargate SG-1 is the exception, easily the best sci-fi television series since Star TreK: TNG, and possibly the best ever, period.With its mixture of intelligent and engrossing stories, terrific acting, cool special effects, and thrilling action, no other show on TV comes close to the combination of quality episodes SG-1 delivers.  Season six, in particular, is quite possibly the best season of the series, though admittedly, this is the only season of SG-1 that I've seen every episode of.  Season six stood out with the addition of Corin Nemec's Jonas Quinn, whom I liked at least as much as Daniel Jackson, probably more.  He was a fantastic addendum, adding much humor and enthusiasm to the show.  It's too bad he was booted off the show by season seven.Redemption (part I): B+, a terrific premiere episode that presents the first dangerous threat from Anubis.  Drags when it focuses on Teal'c's personal life, but a necessary set-up.Redemption (part II): A+, quite possibly the best episode of Stargate, period.  It's as suspenseful and exciting as TV gets, and not even David Hewlett's annoying Dr. Mckay can mar it.Descent: A, that's two absolute winners in a row with yet another one of the all-time best episodes; SG-1 investigates a seemingly empty Goa'uld mothership.  This episode boasts the most in-depth and creepily atmospheric exploration of a spacecraft since Event Horizon.Frozen: B+, intriguing episode focuses on the discovery of a human enclosed in Arctic ice.Nightwalkers: B, Invasion of the Body Snatchers-inspired episode about a town that is possessed at night. Derivative, but entertaining and with a few nicely done eerie moments.Abyss: B-, Jack O'Neill is captured when seemingly betrayed by the Tok'ra symbiote that healed him and has to deal with torture from Ba'al and discovers Daniel Jackson might actually still be alive.  Nothing special plot-wise, but RD Anderson has great chemistry with Michael Shanks, and the prison cell is a cool design.Shadow Play: B-, decent episode about possible world war on Jonas Quinn's home planet.  The plot twist is quite reminiscent of a certain Best Picture Oscar winner a few years back.The Other Guys: B+, very funny episode that introduces goofball Felger, who sets out to rescue SG-1 when they're captured by Anubis' forces.  Surprisingly enough, this episode is funny without hampering the excitement.Allegiance: B, an invisible killer stalks a refugee camp; a bit derivative of Forbidden Planet and Predator, but effective and suspenseful, nonetheless.Cure: A, a miracle cure called Tretonin apparently has both a horrible side effect and an even more shocking discovery of its origin. This story presents one of the series' most compelling ethical questions and is one of the season's best.Prometheus: A-, the spacecraft Prometheus is hijacked; another very exciting and suspenseful episode.Unnatural Selection: B+, SG-1 arrives at a Replicator-overrun planet and discovers some strange inhabitants.  The visit to the planet is atmospheric and the final scene is particularly memorable.Sight Unseen: B-, a very lightweight episode reminiscent of From Beyond.Smoke &amp; Mirrors: A-, when Senator Kinsey is killed, all evidence points to Jack O'Neill as the assassin.  Plot-wise, this is one of the most enthralling episodes of the season.Paradise Lost: B-, an initially very intriguing premise about a hidden cache of weapons and a search for a society that lives in paradise doesn't really go anywhere, but it's still not bad.Metamorphosis: B, experiments being performed by the Goa'uld Nirrti in search of the perfect host leads to some troubling discoveries on the inhabitants of a planet.Disclosure: A-, ultimately little more than a clip show, but this episode does an excellent job of relating the history of the Stargate while also portraying the tensions between nations over the SG program.Forsaken: B+, SG-1 arrives on a planet of stranded pilots that are being hunted by aliens in the forest, but the situation isn't quite as it seems.  The plot twist is fairly obvious, but it's nonetheless a very exciting episode.The Changeling: C+, probably my least favorite episode of the season, this is one of those &quot;what is reality and what isn't?&quot; episodes that's more than a little plodding and tiresome.  It's a nice acting showcase for Christopher Judge, whose Teal'C is experiencing different lives and can't tell which is real, but little else.Memento: B+, a test flight of the Prometheus results in an accident that strands the crew and SG-1 on the far side of the galaxy.  To get the necessary supplies, they need to find a stargate, but they arrive on a planet that seems unwilling to help.  The lack of trust from the aliens is an interesting twist on the usual &quot;aliens who arrive on Earth, but are distrusted by humans&quot; angle.Prophecy: B, Jonas Quinn gains the ability to tell the future, and must prevent the deaths of Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.Full Circle: B+, the season finale features the return of Daniel Jackson, who warns SG-1 that Anubis is in search of an artifact that could make him virtually invincible.  The episode boasts a nice return to Abydos (the planet that &quot;started&quot; it all, if you've seen the movie), a welcome guest star role from Alexis Cruz, and some first-rate action

793486,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B00015HVI8,Indy Reviewer,"[7, 9]","The 6th season of SG-1 has some great episodes, but is more for the hardcore fan than the casual one given the advancement of several plotlines at once.  I say this as someone who didn't start watching the series until midway through season 5; until I'd had a chance to catch up through the DVD sets and SciFi network marathons many of the plots just didn't make much sense as standalone work.  Comprare this to the first few seasons - where the team is more intent on exploring the galaxy, and as such the producers must give you enough background information in the episodes to keep up - and it's the primary reason I take one star off on this year.That said, there are some classics in the season in which actors finally get to act - one of the few valid critiques of a great series in which plot has usually taken precedent over individual accomplishment.  Abyss is the first episode in seasons in which Richard Dean Anderson, confronted with being killed over and over again, has to show depth in his repeated encounters with Michael Shanks as his one potential escape route.  The Other Guys probably made many scifi fans cringe as they saw a little too much of themselves in the geeky guest stars (John Billingsley, Dr. Phlox of Enterprise fame) rescuing the mighty SG-1 team.  The Changeling gives a great acting platform to Chris Judge as Teal'c confronts an alternate universe for himself - and you finally get to see what Chris Judge acts like when he goofs off.  And of course, Full Circle is one of the outright best episodes of the series as two or three plotlines finally resolve themselves and Michael Shanks returns.I'll echo what has been said elsewhere - the media quality on this set is actually quite good, especially compared to season 1, where my DVD player has had problems.  My only gripe - one that I've had for several of the DVDs - is I wish they'd included more outtakes and behind the scenes work.Net net, clearly worth a buy if you're a decent fan.",4,"Hard for the casual fan, but a good DVD set nonetheless.",1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,1978,"['6th', 'season', 'SG-1', 'great', 'episodes', 'more', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'casual', 'one', 'given', 'advancement', 'several', 'plotlines', 'once', 'say', 'someone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'watching', 'series', 'midway', 'season', '5', ""'d"", 'had', 'chance', 'catch', 'up', 'DVD', 'sets', 'SciFi', 'network', 'marathons', 'many', 'plots', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'standalone', 'work', 'Comprare', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'where', 'team', 'more', 'intent', 'exploring', 'galaxy', 'such', 'producers', 'must', 'give', 'enough', 'background', 'information', 'episodes', 'keep', 'up', 'primary', 'reason', 'take', 'one', 'star', 'year.That', 'said', 'are', 'classics', 'season', 'actors', 'finally', 'get', 'act', 'one', 'few', 'valid', 'critiques', 'great', 'series', 'plot', 'usually', 'taken', 'precedent', 'individual', 'accomplishment', 'Abyss', 'first', 'episode', 'seasons', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'confronted', 'being', 'killed', 'over', 'again', 'show', 'depth', 'repeated', 'encounters', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'one', 'potential', 'escape', 'route', 'Other', 'Guys', 'probably', 'made', 'many', 'scifi', 'fans', 'cringe', 'saw', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'geeky', 'guest', 'stars', 'John', 'Billingsley', 'Dr.', 'Phlox', 'Enterprise', 'fame', 'rescuing', 'mighty', 'SG-1', 'team', 'Changeling', 'great', 'acting', 'platform', 'Chris', 'Judge', 'Teal', 'c', 'confronts', 'alternate', 'universe', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Chris', 'Judge', 'acts', 'when', 'goofs', 'off', 'course', 'Full', 'Circle', 'one', 'outright', 'best', 'episodes', 'series', 'two', 'three', 'plotlines', 'finally', 'resolve', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'returns.I', ""'ll"", 'echo', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'elsewhere', 'media', 'quality', 'set', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'compared', 'season', '1', 'where', 'DVD', 'player', 'had', 'problems', 'only', 'gripe', 'one', ""'ve"", 'had', 'several', 'DVDs', 'wish', ""'d"", 'included', 'more', 'outtakes', 'scenes', 'work.Net', 'net', 'clearly', 'buy', ""'re"", 'decent', 'fan']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

793492,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B00015HVI8,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[6, 8]","This is the first season without Daniel Jackson as a central character. He does some cameo and guest star work but he is no longer a part of the team. We are not even sure if he is really alive.This is also the weakest season so far. It is still good entertainment and presents some fun ideas but they seem a little more strained this time around. I don't think this is because of the Jonas Quinn character who replaced Daniel. I've enjoyed watching him trying to establish himself in the team. Its just getting a bit old. I still give it 4 stars but just barely.Episode synopses appear below.Redemption Part 1 - The season opens with the SG1 team still in disarray over the loss of Daniel Jackson. They have tried out 8 replacements and none have worked out. The one person who really wants to be on the team is Jonas, the alien who defected to earth at the end of last season with a supply of Naquadria, the new element even more powerful than Naquida. Teal'c receives word that his wife is dying and heads through the gate to attend her passing. He finds his son bitter over the loss of his mother and wanting to prove himself in his father's eyes. The supply of naquadria brought back by Jonas has proved to be a boon and allowed the development of an experimental fighter with hyperspace capability, something even the ghouls don't have. Meanwhile, a wormhole is opened in Earth's gate and nothing comes though. The SGC is unable to shut it down and being open constantly threatens to blow up the earth if the power is not drained off. O'Neill and Carter are sent off in the new fighter to try and get help from the Asgard but it doesn't the hyperspace capability does not work. Teal'c learns that it is Anubis who is attacking the Earth's gate and tries to figure a way to help. Gen. Hammond is having his own problems with the Russian liaison and a primadonna scientist. There are many different small stories here that will have to wait until the next episode to be resolved.Redemption Part 2 - The Stargate is still set to explode and take the earth with it. Teal'c and his son decide to do a little father and son bonding by taking a ship to the planet where Anubis has his weapon and trying to destroy that weapon. Meanwhile, the crew on earth is trying to figure out how to save the planet. Between Maj. Clark, Jonas and the primmadonna, they come up with a harebrained scheme to use the new fighter to take the thing into space so that it will not be on earth when it goes off. The convolutions making this difficult are too much to get into; watch the episode. Needless to say, things do not work as planned but the Earth gets saved at a price. It looks like Jonas gets to join SG1 and the Russians will have more access to the SGCDescent - At the close of last season, Anubis had captured Thor and tried to download his mind and knowledge into his mothership. The SG1 crew managed to rescue Thor but not before the damage had been done. Thor is now in a coma and it is doubtful if he can ever be revived. Now, Anubis' mother ship has shown up in the solar system. The good news is that it seems to be deserted but that begs the question of why a perfectly good ghoul mother ship would suddenly find its way to Earth without any ghouls aboard to attack and keep things interesting. The SG1 team heads on over to investigate. They find a derelict with the self destruct activated but on hold for an unknown reason. They also encounter some middle aged, mutant ninja jaffa. It seems that when Thor's mind was downloaded, he managed to sabotage the mother ship and halt the countdown, giving it instructions to head to earth. The ninjas manage to sabotage the sabotage and the ship crashes into the Pacific. Now, it is a race against time to see if the SG1 crew can be rescued before the hull breaches and the ship explodes.Frozen - In this curious episode, the SG1 team heads back to Antarctica to the site where the alternate Stargate was found. They have found something new. They find a woman but the amazing thing is that dating shows that she is older than humanity: several million years. It is the archeological find that will set everything we know on its head. As the body is removed from the ice, everyone is amazed to find that she is still alive. She is very frightened when she comes to and is in bad shape but she heals remarkably fast. Remarkably, she is one of the few people ever encountered by the SGC who doesn't speak English. She is a fast study, though. She only ever manages to say one word at the very end but she does begin to understand very quickly. On the down side, everyone around her comes down sick. They get worse and worse. The girl show an ability to heal them but each time she does so, she gets weaker herself. There are more people to cure than she can handle. She dies before she gets to Col. O'Neill and it looks like he is done for. The only hope is a Tok'ra symbiote and he can't stand the Tok'ra.Nightwalkers - I have been referring to the Goa'ould as ghouls because I was too lazy to type the apostrophes. In this episode, we get to see at least some of them as night stalking ghouls with an ambiance right out of the 50s and 60s horror movies. Last season, a billionaire kidnapped Maj. Carter in order to learn more about the ghouls in the hopes that he could be cured of his disease. It did not go well for him. In this episode, we learn that after his death, his company carried on with a line of research cloning ghouls. The experiment has gotten out of control and a small town has been taken over by the ghouls. Two things working in the SGC's favor are that the ghouls are immature and can control their hosts only at night, when they are sleeping and that they are not as bright as they think they are.Abyss - A recent episode ended with Col. O'Neill on the verge of death and being taken off by the Tok'ra in the hope that a symbiote will heal him. He was completely missing from the previous episode but, in this one, we learn that he and the Tok'ra possessing him have stolen off for unknown reasons. The Tok'ra have been reticent about letting SGC know what is going on but have finally come clean, partially and against their will. It looks like the colonel has been captured by Ba'al, a previously unknown ghoul system lord. As he was captured, the Tok'ra infesting him left his body. Now, Ba'al wants to know what they were doing on his planet. And he is resorting to torture to find out. A normal torture session can be ended with death. O'Neill's problem is that whenever he dies, he is brought back with a sarcophagus and it all starts over again, worse than before. To keep him company, Daniel Jackson puts in an appearance. In order to help him out of this untenable situation, he wants to help O'Neill ""ascend"". The problem is that O'Neill doesn't want to ascend. He just wants to die before he can divulge any information. It is an ugly situation.Shadow Play - The SGC gets a communication from Jonas' home planet. The political situation on that planet is getting worse. Jonas' country fears invasion by an alliance of its two enemies. They are threatening to make preemptive use of the naquadria bomb. They want to negotiate with Earth for military technology so they will not need to use the bomb. Earth is skeptical. They don't really trust these people. They are, after all, the same ones who tried to frame Daniel Jackson. In a Machiavellian web, everyone has ulterior motives. Things are made more confusing by Jonas' former mentor who claims to want to begin a coup with the aid of a resistance movement. His judgment, though, is not quite right. Nobody trusts anybody else. It seems to be politics as usual. They seem to be trying to draw some parallels with Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.The Other Guys - This is a comedy episode. The SG1 team is offworld with a group of scientists. They are all dweebs in the nerdiest sense of the word but one of them has a severe case of hero worship for Col. O'Neill. When the SG1 team is captured by some Jaffa working for Anubis, the geeks take it upon themselves to mount a rescue mission. In the finest tradition of the Keystone Kops, they manage to wreak mayhem at every step of the way until they find SG1, only to learn that SG1 is on an undercover operation. The geeks come through, though, when the original plans fall to pieces. This one is lots of fun.Allegiance - A Tok'ra outpost is overrun. Because there is not other choice, the SG1 team evacuates the Tok'ra to Earth's alpha site, a planet which nobody has the coordinates for. The site is staffed primarily with free Jaffa. Therein lies a big problem. The Jaffa do not like the Tok'ra. The Tok'ra hate the Jaffa. Col. O'Neill dislikes the Tok'ra but the Jaffa are getting on his nerves too. When a Tok'ra is killed, the rest are sure that a Jaffa did the deed. When the suspected Jaffa is killed, the Jaffa are sure that the Tok'ra have extracted revenge. The situation is getting more and more tense. There is a hidden enemy afoot with a strategy of divide and conquer.Cure - The SG1 team visits a new planet which is eager for trade and relations. They seem very open and even offer a miracle drug which cures all human ailments in trade. What they want are gate addresses. The problem is that the gate addresses they insist upon are all ghoul home worlds. Even when warned of the danger, they insist that those are the addresses they wish. Teal'c and Jonas stumble onto the source of the wonder drug. They are using ghouls. They even have a ghoul queen. Things are not as they seem, however. The queen is not a ghoul. She is a Tok'ra. Her freedom will condemn to death countless of the natives who are addicted to the drug processed from the bodies of her offspring. It is much less macabre than it sounds.Prometheus - Maj. Carter is surprised when a reporter confronts her and asks about the Prometheus project, a secret project involving building a new, hyperspace capable ship. She has some of the facts. She has enough to frighten the politicians into letting her take a camera crew on board. They agree to swap exclusive footage in exchange for keeping the story under wraps until the Pentagon is ready to release the information. Nobody is happy with this arrangement but they get less happy when the camera crew turns out to be a bunch of NID rogues bent on rescuing Col. Symmonds and the ghoul who took over the millionaire last season. The hijacking takes place and the SG1 team finds themselves stranded in an unknown location on an experimental ship and now way to get home. It's a cliffhanger.Unnatural Selection - The previous episode ended with the SG1 team stranded in an unknown position aboard and experimental human ship with no way to find their way home. The Asgard are there to save the day, however, in the person of Thor. The catch is that SG1 has to also save the Asgard. The battle against the replicators is fairing poorly. They have lost their home world. The trap they had set did not work. They want SG1 to fix the problem. They had constructed a bomb to slow down time around the replicators. The idea is that hundreds of years would pass for the rest of the universe while moments passed for the replilcators. Hopefully, that would buy some breathing room. The problem is that the replicators found the device and reversed it. Time for them has passed at an incredible rate and the have evolved. The human role in this is to get to the planet and reverse the time bomb. The assumption is that human technology is so backward the replicators will not see it as a threat.Sight Unseen - The SG1 crew brings back an artifact from an otherwise deserted planet. It is a high tech piece of equipment but nobody is sure exactly what it is. Not long after their return, Jonas sees an alien bug flit through a wall but nobody else sees it. They think he is crazy until they start seeing bugs as well. It turns out that the device was used by the ancients to study life in other dimensions. It's only used to see; the bugs have no access to our world. The problem is that those who come into contact with the machine start seeing the things. So do those who come into contact with anyone who has been in contact with the machine. This leads to widespread sightings in the civilian community and the SG1 team has to figure a way to contain the secret and reverse the process.Smoke & Mirrors - The sleazy senator is back. He's back until the first few minutes of the show when he is assassinated. All the evidence, including videotapes, show that Col. O'Neill is the assassin and he is arrested for the murder. It is up to the rest of the SG1 team to clear him but they have very little to work with. Among the clues are memories of the mimic devices aliens used in the episode, FOOTHOLD, to impersonate earth personnel. The other clue is an admission from an NID agent that there is corruption there. As always, money increases the sleaze factor, especially with politicians. What's worse, the sleazy SOB's get even worse when they are cleared.Paradise Lost - Harry Mayborne, the former NID colonel in hiding, turns up in Col. O'Neill's backyard. He is tired of living on the run and wants a pardon. He says that he has the key to a secret cache of alien technology and weapons located when the NID was running its illicit Stargate program. He agrees to help the SG1 team locate it only if he can go along. The deal sounds too good to be true but Mayborne has been semi-trustworthy in the past so they agree to take him. When they get to the planet and the ""doorway"", he does have the ""key"" device. Instead of just opening it, though, he tries to zap everyone and go through the doorway by himself. Col. O'Neill goes through right on his heels. It turns out that Mayborne thought he was escaping to a sort of paradise. Its true that he couldn't stand running anymore but there never was a hidden cache. Now both of the colonels are marooned in very primitive circumstances with no way to get back. The paradise shows signs of former habitation but nobody is alive there. The SGC cannot locate them and a native plant is causing Mayborne to lose his mind. O'Neill has a hard time not shooting him just on general principles.Metamorphosis - The Russian SG team comes home with a desperately sick human. The human claims that his race is being wiped out by the ghoul, Nerti. A rescue team goes out led by SG1 and finds a bunch of people who regard Nerti as a goddess who is healing them of a terrible plague. In truth, though, she is the cause of their problems she is using the local peoples as guinea pigs while trying to develop an improved model host. She is changing them drastically and they are dying without her treatments. They are also dying with them. The SG1 team wants to rescue these people but they don't want to be rescued. Instead, they demonstrate telekinetic abilities and capture the SG1 team for further use in Nerti's experiments.Disclusure - It looks like some of the episodes were running over budget so it was time for a retrospective episode that is made primarily of old footage with minimal new material. Gen. Hammond leads a briefing at the Pentagon for selected foreign ambassadors. In it, he discloses the existence of the Stargate program and makes a pitch for international cooperation in fighting the ghouls but wants the program to remain secret to prevent panic. The ambassadors can hardly believe what they are hearing and, even after they believe, are eager to publicize the program for political advantage. They are aided in this by the slimy senator who sees this as an opportunity to gain control over the program for his own ends. The episode is mostly a bunch of flashbacks as the General and the senator argue about the merits of USAF control.Forsaken - While investigating a new planet, the SG1 team finds a crashed ship with three human survivors. They are human and are more technically advanced than earth but they have no knowledge of the Stargate system. While discussing with the stranded humans the possibility of fixing the ship, they are all attacked by other aliens. The marooned spacefarers say that these other are barbarians who have been killing and eating them but the colonel is suspicious. He is especially so when they insist on killing all the aliens they encounter and refuse to try and take prisoners. Not all is as it seems.The Changeling - This is a strange one with more overtones of budgetary problems. Throughout most of it, Teal'c bounces back and forth between being a firefighter (the rest of the SG1 team are other parts of the crew) and being a member of SG1, but with things not quite as they should be. In each state, he thinks he is dreaming and that the other state is the ""real"" one. In each state, he is giving up vital body parts to keep his old mentor, Bray'tac alive. In all states, he gets visited by Daniel Jackson. I say that this one seems low budget not because it is poorly done, but because firefighter sets cost much less than the extravagant Stargate sets. It is otherwise well done, if a little confusing at first.Memento - The SG1 team is assigned as liaison to the newly commissioned Prometheus ship, the one introduced at the end of the last season as humanity's first starship. They are simple there as advisors, not in a command capacity. While on their maiden voyage, there is a problem with the hyperdrive and no spare parts are on board. They are too far to reach earth and too far from their destination to get help their. Jonas notices that they have popped out of hyperspace near a planet for which they have reason to believe a Stargate exists. They have never been able to reach the planet and surmise that the gate is buried. They decide to go looking for it. The natives are suspicious. The president wants to help them and the military leader thinks they are bent on conquest. They all think of the gate as a myth. The SG1 team and the Prometheus find themselves stuck in the middle of competing political factions and worldviews. It's a good one.Prophecy - The SG1 team visits a planet where the human population is enslaved by a minor ghoul who is forcing them to mine naqueda. The team is ready to help them throw off the ghoul yoke but there are a couple of problems. Jonas is starting to have accurate visions of the future. The problem is knowing which way to act. This condition seems to be the result of a brain tumor inflicted by one of Nerti's eugenics experiments. The tumor looks like it is going to kill him. Meanwhile, back on the planet, one of the human slaves wants to be a good little toady and gain favor from the ghoul. He betrays SG1. The problem is figuring how to act in light of Jonas' predictions.Full Circle - While riding the elevator at SG1, Col. O'Neill has encounter with Daniel Jackson who warns him that Anubis is on his way to Abydos to retrieve an extremely powerful artifact, the Eye of Ra. Jackson warns that with the Eye, Anubis will become too powerful to confront. O'Neill is worried that everyone will think he is crazy because Daniel has ""ascended"". They believe him because many of the others have run into Daniel as well. Daniel finally decides to take a stand and help the earth team. In doing so he makes a deal with Anubis to prevent the destruction of Abydos. That is semantically equal to saying he made a deal with the devil. Anubis has been a shadowy figure all season but in this one we learn a little more about him. Its not pretty. On the plus side, it looks like Daniel will be back next season. Also, some more strange plot lines are in store for the future.",4,It Mostly Coasts Along,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,19644,"['first', 'season', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'central', 'character', 'cameo',

Season six was no exception. The opening three episodes were some of the best in the series, and the finale was nothing short of amazing. The addition of Jonas' character was great as a team member, and further plot lines in the show itself grew. Finally some results from the shows original main premise, aquiring technology to fight the Goa'uld, is shown in the F-302 and F-303.The story of the Asguard vs. Replicators comes to an end, and at the end of the season, we get a new sense of direction for the plot of season seven.

In fact, we started to wonder if the entire writing team had left the show-?  For one episode, it must be that none of the main cast were available for shooting because the film editor spliced together scenes from past episodes under a cover story that was so poorly conceived and executed that it made me cranky.

Consistently good stories, flawless casting, solid writing, convincing acting, real character development, great special effects, stories that make you think, laugh, cry, have you on the edge of your seat, it's all there. Stargate didn't take three or four seasons to find its groove, it had great shows in the very first season and has been a solid performer ever since. Absolutely amazing, especially so for science fiction, a genre which is notorious for less-than-impressive shows.If that weren't enough, MGM offers an outstanding product in these DVDs at a very nice price. These boxed sets are attractive and friendly. Friendly in that every episode is listed on the box so I can find one without having to even take the boxes off the shelf and discs are easy to access (I don't have to unfold the packaging across the couch to get to a disc). The quality is top-notch (I have a high-end DVD player, TV, and audio system, so I can tell when a DVD is mediocre, and lots of them are mediocre). They've always had nice extras, but starting with season 4 they've had audio commentaries for every episode, and even those are consistently entertaining. All this for a price that's half of what you'd pay for Star Trek or X-Files and 2/3 of what you'd pay for Babylon 5. MGM hasn't cut a single corner with these and it shows. Oh, and they don't make you wait years to get them on DVD. It just doesn't get any better than this.In fact, these are almost too good. A while back I stopped worrying about seeing the shows as they were broadcast because I *know* I'll get every season on DVD as soon as it's released. I try to see them as they're broadcast, but the show and the DVDs have been so consistently good for so long, I know I'll be happy with them, and they come out not too long after the season ends. Awesome.In this day and age, it's nice to see a company consistently offering such a solid product for a fair price.

Just the right combination of action, humor, heroism, character depth and interplay, along with imagination that is out the kazoo.  Richard Dean Anderson MAKES the series so when he takes a hiatus starting some in Season 7 and 8, and definitely in Seasons 9 and 10, it makes you long for the earlier years of the series - including Season 6.  (RDA wanted to work less so he could be with his young daughter).  But the first 8 seasons are all terrific.  Season 9 and 10 need Anderson.Season 6 includes one of the best episodes of the entire 8 year series, Abyss.  It is about Jack O'Neill captured by the evil Ba'al who torments him and kills him and revives him over and over in the sarcophagus.  But what makes it special is Daniel Jackson, played by Michael Shanks, who returns in a ""snippet"" role trying to help Col. O'Neill get through the harsh time in which he finds himself.  Daniel Jackson is ""ascended"" so he has ""rules"" as to how much or how little he can help anyone.Let's just say it's a great episode.  Others in this season are also well done:  Descent, Frozen, the Other Guys, Smoke and Mirrors, Paradise Lost, Full Circle - just to name a few of the really good episodes in Season 6.Stargate SG1 never gets old.

This makes Season 6 stand out as sort of an odd duck. Lots of fans initially didn't want to like the character of Quinn because he was replacing fan-favorite Jackson, and by the time the character (and his actor) began to come into his own among the cast, the producers had secured Michael Shanks' triumphant return. Jonas Quinn was subsequently written off the show, with barely any send-off whatsoever.Hindsight has been more favorable to Jonas Quinn. The character was interesting, well-written, and well-acted. He was distinct enough from Jackson that it doesn't feel like the producers are trying to clone him, though he still filled the same crucial role in the show's core group of characters.

793522,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00015HVI8,Robert Moore,"[13, 14]","The first five seasons of STARGATE SG-1 were notable for their remarkable consistency not only in quality but in style and substance.  There was, in fact, little actual variation.  But Season Six brought some major changes.  First, Michael Shanks took a year off from the show to pursue his own projects, though he did reappear in a few episodes either as Daniel Jackson or as the voice of Thor.  Second, Daniel Jackson's place was taken by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn, who had appeared in a Season Five episode as a denizen of another planet.  Third, for much of the season the show abandoned episodes that involved them exploring new planets.  They didn't completely skip visiting other worlds, but they did far less than in previous seasons.Despite these changes, though certainly not because of them, the show remained steady and solid throughout the season.  There were a number of truly superb individual episodes and the show generally maintained the quality that had distinguished it for several seasons.  Corin Nemec did the best he could to fill the gap left by the departure of Daniel Jackson.  To compensate for his lack of education compared to Daniel, the writers gave him an unusual ability to absorb new knowledge.  There were also hints that his physiology was unique in some way that felt as if it would have played a major role in future seasons.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, I suppose), the return of Daniel Jackson to the show precluded the need for Jonas, and he was with only a tiny bit of ceremony shipped back to his home planet very early in Season Seven.  I personally had mixed feelings about Jonas's presence and departure.  He never really meshed with the other characters and never seemed to be a part of the team the way that Daniel had, but on the other hand the way he was so obviously just jettisoned the second he was no longer needed was rather bothersome.  As it was, any attentive fan could sense the abandonment of future plot lines.The absence of Daniel Jackson in Season Six was definitely felt.  Daniel functioned as the conscience of SG-1, the unapologetic idealist.  He adhered unrelentingly to classic liberal ideals of fairness and justice and was unsparing in his efforts in support of those ideals.  Without him, the team sometimes seemed to be without the focus they had had earlier.  Not that the show ever flagged in quality or interest.  It just felt like a different show.  In many ways, the show felt his absence more than it would feel the absence of other characters who left in Seasons 8 and 9.  There were many good things in Season Six, but Daniel Jackson's absence defined it as much as the more specific things that happened.  The season also increased the number of references to the Ancients, which would lead to major things in subsequent seasons.No fan of SG-1 would want to miss this season, but it was the harbinger of things to come.  Namely, each season from here on out would bring major changes in the show, with at least one major character disappearing in each of the next three seasons.  The uniformity of Seasons One through Five would give way to an evolving cast of characters.  In a way, one could divide the series into Seasons One-Five and then Six onwards.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just very different.",5,"Another excellent season, only with a number of significant changes",1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,3298,"['first', 'five', 'seasons', 'STARGATE', 'SG-1', 'were', 'notable', 'remarkable', 'consistency', 'not', 'only', 'quality', 'style', 'substance', 'was', 'fact', 'little', 'actual', 'variation', 'Season', 'Six', 'brought', 'major', 'changes', 'First', 'Michael', 'Shanks', 'took', 'year', 'show', 'pursue', 'own', 'projects', 'did', 'reappear', 'few', 'episodes', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'voice', 'Thor', 'Second', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'place', 'was', 'taken', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'who', 'had', 'appeared', 'Season', 'Five', 'episode', 'denizen', 'planet', 'Third', 'much', 'season', 'show', 'abandoned', 'episodes', 'involved', 'exploring', 'new', 'planets', 'did', ""n't"", 'completely', 'skip', 'visiting', 'other', 'worlds', 'did', 'far', 'less', 'previous', 'seasons.Despite', 'changes', 'certainly', 'not', 'show', 'remained', 'steady', 'solid', 'season', 'were', 'number', 'truly', 'superb', 'individual', 'episodes', 'show', 'generally', 'maintained', 'quality', 'had', 'distinguished', 'several', 'seasons', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'fill', 'gap', 'left', 'departure', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'compensate', 'lack', 'education', 'compared', 'Daniel', 'writers', 'gave', 'unusual', 'ability', 'absorb', 'new', 'knowledge', 'were', 'also', 'hints', 'physiology', 'was', 'unique', 'way', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'future', 'seasons', 'Unfortunately', 'fortunately', 'suppose', 'return', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'show', 'precluded', 'need', 'Jonas', 'was', 'only', 'tiny', 'bit', 'ceremony', 'shipped', 'back', 'home', 'planet', 'very', 'early', 'Season', 'Seven', 'personally', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Jonas', 'presence', 'departure', 'never', 'really', 'meshed', 'other', 'characters', 'never', 'seemed', 'be', 'part', 'team', 'way', 'Daniel', 'had', 'other', 'hand', 'way', 'was', 'so', 'obviously', 'just', 'jettisoned', 'second', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'was', 'rather', 'bothersome', 'was', 'attentive', 'fan', 'could', 'sense', 'abandonment', 'future', 'plot', 'lines.The', 'absence', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Season', 'Six', 'was', 'definitely', 'felt', 'Daniel', 'functioned', 'conscience', 'SG-1', 'unapologetic', 'idealist', 'adhered', 'unrelentingly', 'classic', 'liberal', 'ideals', 'fairness', 'justice', 'was', 'unsparing', 'efforts', 'support', 'ideals', 'team', 'sometimes', 'seemed', 'be', 'focus', 'had', 'had', 'earlier', 'Not', 'show', 'ever', 'flagged', 'quality', 'interest', 'just', 'felt', 'different', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'show', 'felt', 'absence', 'more', 'would', 'feel', 'absence', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'left', 'Seasons', '8', '9', 'were', 'many', 'good', 'things', 'Season', 'Six', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'absence', 'defined', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'specific', 'things', 'happened', 'season', 'also', 'increased', 'number', 'references', 'Ancients', 'would', 'lead', 'major', 'things', 'subsequent', 'seasons.No', 'fan', 'SG-1', 'would', 'want', 'miss', 'season', 'was', 'harbinger', 'things', 'come', 'Namely', 'season', 'here', 'out', 'would', 'bring', 'major', 'changes', 'show', 'least', 'one', 'major', 'character', 'disappearing', 'next', 'three', 'seasons', 'uniformity', 'Seasons', 'One', 'Five', 'would', 'give', 'way', 'evolving', 'cast', 'characters', 'way', 'one', 'could', 'divide', 'series', 'Seasons', 'One-Five', 'then', 'Six', 'onwards', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'very', 'different']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

While channel surfing I came across reruns a few times. Since I love good Sci-fi, I watched a few minutes each time. I was totally unable to understand what was going on, it always seemed as though I was coming in at the middle of the story without knowing who, what, where or when. Fortunately, my son started watching some of the earlier shows and began to get hooked.  He asked me to get the original movie and year one of the series, which had just come out.  Knowing him to be a young man with good taste, I bought them the next day.  He and I started watching, then my daughter and finally my wife.  Within 2 weeks we were all hopelessly addicted.  We since have purchased and watched years 2 through 6 and watched year 7 on the Si-Fi channel.  I'm the type of person that sees a movie and doesn't want to see it again for about 10 years, but this program I can watch over and over again.  I said it is the BEST TV series ever and it is, nothing else even comes close.  I don't mean just the best science fiction series, I mean the best series of any genre.  It has a perfect mix of action, drama and comedy.  The character development has been excellent, you begin to feel you know Jack, Sam, Daniel, T'ealc and all the characters personally.  The plot lines have evolved throughout the series, continually building and developing.  That is why I couldn't pick up on the show and appreciate it in the beginning.

So far everyone who has taken me up on my offer has become equally hooked. I hope that this show runs forever and that the rumors about season 8 being the last are false.

Now, with the premier of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; on sci-fi the intent of the show's producers is clear - the tablet found at the end of season 6 that speaks of the &quot;lost city of the ancients&quot; and all the ensuing related plotlines in season 7 refer to the lost city of Atlantis, and are thus the spin-off point for &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;.Having said that, season 6 is definitely worth watching for its theme development around the deepening mystery of Anubis.  Although Daniel Jackson makes several appearances, it is also anti-climactic since I have become fond of Jonas Quinn by this time.

Perhaps this character evolution is all related to a higher design for the series?The DVDs all come with featurettes and supplementary material and options for the home viewer.Overall, I give Stargate SG-1, season 6 my usual rating of five stars for continuing to be some of the best TV being produced.",5,Now it all makes sense...,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,1394,"['have', 'always', 'believed', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'happening', 'TV', 'see', 'reason', 'change', 'mind', 'now.There', 'have', 'been', 'rumors', 'going', 'around', 'year', 'so', 'final', 'season', 'Now', 'premier', 'quot', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'quot', 'sci-fi', 'intent', 'show', 'producers', 'clear', 'tablet', 'found', 'end', 'season', '6', 'speaks', 'quot', 'lost', 'city', 'ancients', 'quot', 'ensuing', 'related', 'plotlines', 'season', '7', 'refer', 'lost', 'city', 'Atlantis', 'are', 'thus', 'spin-off', 'point', 'quot', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'quot', '.Having', 'said', 'season', '6', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'theme', 'development', 'deepening', 'mystery', 'Anubis', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'several', 'appearances', 'also', 'anti-climactic', 'have', 'become', 'fond', 'Jonas', 'Quinn', 'time', 'season', '6', 'think', 'character', 'Sam', 'Carter', 'been', 'getting', 'progressively', 'tougher', 'edge', 'death', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'that', 'much', 'much', 'preferred', 'softer', 'more', 'personable', 'Samantha', 'previous', 'five', 'seasons', 'Perhaps', 'character', 'evolution', 'all', 'related', 'higher', 'design', 'series', 'DVDs', 'come', 'featurettes', 'supplementary', 'material', 'options', 'home', 'viewer.Overall', 'give', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'season', '6', 'usual', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'continuing', 'be', 'best', 'TV', 'being', 'produced']",Stargate SG-1 Season 6

As do the Earthbased villian episodes, and while our buddy Apophis has been [very likely] dead for a while, the Goa'ulds that filled his power vacuum are not any nicer...

Mainly with the two-part season premieres which continue through the ninth season(except the ninth season has a three-part start), and the newly added Prometheus. I expected this season to be crap because of the loss of Daniel Jackson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jonas was an acceptable substitute. I read tons of reviews saying that Michael Shanks(Daniel Jackson) left the show because of stress and tension, and through commentary on the seventh season premiere, learned that he just left because of his new-born child. His guest star roles were outstanding. The best episodes were: Paradise Lost, The Changeling, and Full Circle. Other great episodes were: Redemption p1 and p2, Descent, Abyss, Shadow Play, Allegiance, Cure, Prometheus(no more Simmons-YAY!!!), Unnatural Selection, Smoke and Mirrors, and Prophecy.
