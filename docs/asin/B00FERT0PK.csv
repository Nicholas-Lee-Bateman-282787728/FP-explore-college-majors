(Hughes was in The Twilight Zone episode, The Howling Man, playing the devil.)  Not content with just offing poor Gideon, Drake wanted to make sure none of the devil worship magic could bring Drew back, so he had Drew's head buried in one box, his body in another.

EDDIE EDWARDS,"[38, 38]","Universal Vault Series THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE (1958) is finally released on DVD - print quality is the best out there to date (very good to excellent) but it is soft in places and definitely could use an upgrade. No special features, no trailer, but still worth the price. I dig this flawed B movie - lots of creepy moments and a fantastic plot that's fun even if logic is in short supply. The film is loaded with eerie music from Universal's THIS ISLAND EARTH, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and THE MONOLITH MONSTERS (some other cuts of music were later re-used in William Castle's 1966 Universal picture LET'S KILL UNCLE). I have an old Detroit newspaper from 1958 and the big horror double bill that summer was HORROR OF DRACULA and co-feature THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE - I know the film has a lot of unintended laughs but I think the director's heart is in the right place - it's his head I'm worried about. Robin Hughes is excellent as the evil Gideon Drew (reminds me of his HOWLING MAN performance on TWILIGHT ZONE two years later). Andra Martin is sexy scary and William Reynolds makes a solid leading man. By the way the big blockbuster that summer of 1958 was the Rock Hudson film TWILIGHT FOR THE GODS (a now obscure film that has never made it to VHS or DVD) and yet more than fifty years later there is still demand for low budget horror flicks like THE THING THAT COULDN'T DIE.

1671391,AZ7NZH4APOOZ8,B00FERT0PK,"William Kersten ""William""","[6, 6]","My star rating is for this wonderful, crazy film, which is the essence of low budget 1950s horror at its best - great low key lighting, the fabulous Universal music library, surprisingly good cast in every part, and a story which is both entertaining and insane, about a whispering severed head looking for its body, an anxious young woman who is a neurotic water witch, some strangely suggestive scenes of the two leading ladies in bed together - all of it like a crazy dream you half remembered and which became incoherent but fascinating.  There are many bizarre and memorable images throughout this film.However, this video transfer is so bad that I was extremely disappointed and actually shocked it was put out by the studio that owns the film!  They have somewhere in their vaults the original negative of this well-photographed film (shot by an ASC director of photography) but they did NOT use that material for the transfer. Instead, they obviously used  a video master that was taken from another video - a copy of a video copy.  In fact, it is so bad it actually looks like a VHS tape home-transferred onto DVDR.  I also have the Sinister Cinema version of this film, and it is better in video quality than this one released by Universal - and Sinister did its own video master from an old 16mm print!  Universal  does not show much respect for this well made old film from their own library.  Maybe some day it will be given a better treatment.",5,A great B movie given a bad video release,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1457,"['star', 'rating', 'wonderful', 'crazy', 'film', 'essence', 'low', 'budget', '1950s', 'horror', 'best', 'great', 'low', 'key', 'lighting', 'fabulous', 'Universal', 'music', 'library', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'cast', 'part', 'story', 'entertaining', 'insane', 'whispering', 'severed', 'head', 'looking', 'body', 'anxious', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'neurotic', 'water', 'witch', 'strangely', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'bed', 'together', 'crazy', 'dream', 'half', 'remembered', 'became', 'incoherent', 'fascinating', 'are', 'many', 'bizarre', 'memorable', 'images', 'film.However', 'video', 'transfer', 'so', 'bad', 'was', 'extremely', 'disappointed', 'actually', 'shocked', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'studio', 'film', 'have', 'somewhere', 'vaults', 'original', 'negative', 'well-photographed', 'film', 'shot', 'ASC', 'director', 'photography', 'did', 'NOT', 'use', 'material', 'transfer', 'Instead', 'obviously', 'used', 'video', 'master', 'was', 'taken', 'video', 'copy', 'video', 'copy', 'fact', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'VHS', 'tape', 'home-transferred', 'DVDR', 'also', 'have', 'Sinister', 'Cinema', 'version', 'film', 'better', 'video', 'quality', 'one', 'released', 'Universal', 'Sinister', 'did', 'own', 'video', 'master', 'old', '16mm', 'print', 'Universal', 'not', 'show', 'much', 'respect', 'well', 'made', 'old', 'film', 'own', 'library', 'Maybe', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'given', 'better', 'treatment']",The Thing That Couldn't Die
