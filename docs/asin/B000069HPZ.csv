707108,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000069HPZ,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[51, 54]","NOTE:  This same yoga practice, now being release by Gaiam, was previously released by Living Arts.  It has also been released under the title ""Back Care Yoga,"" but it is NOT the same practice as ""Back Care Yoga for Beginners.""Excellent yoga instructor Rodney Yee offers this 3-part workout focused on strengthening back muscles in order to maintain a healthy back. He utilizes various props (blanket, bolster, chair, brick, strap) to make the poses more gentle and accessible to those at all levels of fitness (however, absolute beginners should probably stick with his other practice, Back Care Yoga for Beginners).The first 16-minute section concentrates on simple stretches to warm up the back muscles. Poses are done either while lying on the floor or in a seated position, and Rodney uses a blanket to increase range of motion. The second segment is a bit longer (around 18 minutes) and places greater emphasis on strength moves. It begins with basic backbends (eg, cat pose) and moves on to standing poses modified by use of a chair; the segment ends with a series of lying stretches. In the final section, Rodney uses a wider variety of props, including TWO chairs and both the blanket AND the bolster. This is a slow-moving, approximately 16-minute segment which focuses on fostering relaxation through practicing a small number of postures held for a longer period of time.At times, Rodney's reliance on props is a bit distracting, particularly while you are trying to relax during the final section. However, he always allows ample time to relocate the props in-between poses, and his use of the props is definitely beneficial, particularly during the second practice. Rodney's manner is extremely calm and relaxing, and his voiceover is always perfectly in sync with his on-screen performance. One minor criticism is that he doesn't offer mirrored instruction, but this is easily ignored given his otherwise excellent cueing. Overall, this is a very good series of yoga practices by a master yoga instructor.",4,Three workouts focused on maintaining a healthy back,1240876800,"04 28, 2009",2009,2020,"['NOTE', 'same', 'yoga', 'practice', 'now', 'being', 'release', 'Gaiam', 'was', 'previously', 'released', 'Living', 'Arts', 'also', 'been', 'released', 'title', 'Back', 'Care', 'Yoga', 'NOT', 'same', 'practice', 'Back', 'Care', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', 'Excellent', 'yoga', 'instructor', 'Rodney', 'Yee', '3-part', 'workout', 'focused', 'strengthening', 'back', 'muscles', 'order', 'maintain', 'healthy', 'back', 'various', 'props', 'blanket', 'bolster', 'chair', 'brick', 'strap', 'make', 'poses', 'more', 'gentle', 'accessible', 'levels', 'fitness', 'however', 'absolute', 'beginners', 'should', 'probably', 'stick', 'other', 'practice', 'Back', 'Care', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', '.The', 'first', '16-minute', 'section', 'concentrates', 'simple', 'stretches', 'warm', 'up', 'back', 'muscles', 'Poses', 'are', 'done', 'either', 'lying', 'floor', 'seated', 'position', 'Rodney', 'blanket', 'increase', 'range', 'motion', 'second', 'segment', 'bit', 'longer', '18', 'minutes', 'places', 'greater', 'emphasis', 'strength', 'moves', 'basic', 'backbends', 'eg', 'cat', 'pose', 'standing', 'poses', 'modified', 'use', 'chair', 'segment', 'series', 'lying', 'stretches', 'final', 'section', 'Rodney', 'wider', 'variety', 'props', 'including', 'TWO', 'chairs', 'blanket', 'bolster', 'slow-moving', 'approximately', '16-minute', 'segment', 'fostering', 'relaxation', 'practicing', 'small', 'number', 'postures', 'held', 'longer', 'period', 'time.At', 'times', 'Rodney', 'reliance', 'props', 'bit', 'distracting', 'particularly', 'are', 'trying', 'relax', 'final', 'section', 'However', 'always', 'ample', 'time', 'relocate', 'props', 'in-between', 'poses', 'use', 'props', 'definitely', 'beneficial', 'particularly', 'second', 'practice', 'Rodney', 'manner', 'extremely', 'calm', 'relaxing', 'voiceover', 'always', 'perfectly', 'sync', 'on-screen', 'performance', 'One', 'minor', 'criticism', ""n't"", 'offer', 'mirrored', 'instruction', 'easily', 'ignored', 'given', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'cueing', 'Overall', 'very', 'good', 'series', 'yoga', 'practices', 'master', 'yoga', 'instructor']",Back Care Yoga
707109,A2L658RAOSOLDF,B000069HPZ,Beverly,"[2, 2]","I tweaked my back 3 weeks ago.  I tried a deep tissue back massage, heat and steam sauna, and my doctor put me on anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medication.  I felt like the pain was spreading down to my thighs and my whole body seemed to be getting stiffer.  The medication initially provided some relief, but the pain came back worst.  I decided to try yoga that would target my back and Amazon had Rodney Yee's back care yoga workout that I could rent/download immediately for 7 days.  I am a fan of Yee so I also ordered a back care workout.  So I rented it, and used it right away.  I'm was using heat and taking medication but this is what happened to me.  First, the workout requires a lot of equipment (strap, blanket, blocks, chair and bolster), I used things around my house, a cloth belt (strap), blanket and pillows (bolster), and I reached for where the blocks should be.Day oneThis was the most difficult, I was very tight.  I was tight in places that I didn't realize.  I had to keep rewinding the video to find equipment or get the equipment in the right position. I didn't want to miss anything and I wanted to do everything.  The ab strengthening is very difficult, so I supported my head with one hand and used my other arm for everything else, I still had back pain.Day 2 was much smoother.  I knew what to expect and I appreciated using the blanket and strap.  When I finished, I was walking around putting everything up and I realized that my back wasn't hurting.  When I turned or gently bent down, because I was testing my back there was a slight twinge.  I didn't take any more medication only a hot shower.Day 3 was the best.  I flowed through the workout non stop.  I still had to support my head when doing the ab strengthening, but I listened to my body.  My back is no longer hurting.  I haven't taken the medication in 2 days.  And a lot of stiffness is gone.I believe this yoga routine helped my back.  I was doing a lot of things to help it, but the relief didn't come until after I started the back care yoga routine.  The best way to use this workout is to stretch to your flexibility.  If anything is hurting don&#8217;t do it or modify it.  I really feel good.  I have 4 days left on my rental and I plan to do the workout everyday until it expires.",5,Really Does Work,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,2293,"['tweaked', 'back', '3', 'weeks', 'ago', 'tried', 'deep', 'tissue', 'back', 'massage', 'heat', 'steam', 'sauna', 'doctor', 'put', 'anti-inflammatory', 'muscle', 'relaxant', 'medication', 'felt', 'pain', 'was', 'spreading', 'down', 'thighs', 'whole', 'body', 'seemed', 'be', 'getting', 'stiffer', 'medication', 'initially', 'provided', 'relief', 'pain', 'came', 'back', 'worst', 'decided', 'try', 'yoga', 'would', 'target', 'back', 'Amazon', 'had', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'back', 'care', 'yoga', 'could', 'rent/download', 'immediately', '7', 'days', 'am', 'fan', 'Yee', 'also', 'ordered', 'back', 'care', 'workout', 'rented', 'used', 'right', 'away', ""'m"", 'was', 'using', 'heat', 'taking', 'medication', 'happened', 'First', 'workout', 'lot', 'equipment', 'strap', 'blanket', 'blocks', 'chair', 'bolster', 'used', 'things', 'house', 'cloth', 'belt', 'strap', 'blanket', 'pillows', 'bolster', 'reached', 'where', 'blocks', 'should', 'be.Day', 'oneThis', 'was', 'most', 'difficult', 'was', 'very', 'tight', 'was', 'tight', 'places', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'had', 'keep', 'rewinding', 'video', 'find', 'equipment', 'get', 'equipment', 'right', 'position', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'anything', 'wanted', 'do', 'everything', 'ab', 'strengthening', 'very', 'difficult', 'supported', 'head', 'one', 'hand', 'used', 'other', 'arm', 'everything', 'else', 'still', 'had', 'back', 'pain.Day', '2', 'was', 'much', 'smoother', 'knew', 'what', 'expect', 'appreciated', 'using', 'blanket', 'strap', 'When', 'finished', 'was', 'walking', 'around', 'putting', 'everything', 'up', 'realized', 'back', 'was', ""n't"", 'hurting', 'When', 'turned', 'gently', 'bent', 'down', 'was', 'testing', 'back', 'there', 'was', 'slight', 'twinge', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'medication', 'only', 'hot', 'shower.Day', '3', 'was', 'best', 'flowed', 'workout', 'non', 'stop', 'still', 'had', 'support', 'head', 'when', 'doing', 'ab', 'strengthening', 'listened', 'body', 'back', 'longer', 'hurting', 'have', ""n't"", 'taken', 'medication', '2', 'days', 'lot', 'stiffness', 'gone.I', 'believe', 'yoga', 'routine', 'helped', 'back', 'was', 'doing', 'lot', 'things', 'help', 'relief', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'started', 'back', 'care', 'yoga', 'routine', 'best', 'way', 'use', 'workout', 'stretch', 'flexibility', 'anything', 'hurting', 'don', '8217', 'do', 'modify', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'have', '4', 'days', 'left', 'rental', 'plan', 'do', 'workout', 'everyday']",Back Care Yoga
707110,A2JG0EPU314S7H,B000069HPZ,C. Cummings,"[0, 0]","This was the first yoga video I have ever bought. I always thought trying to watch a Yoga DVD would not be effective, since there is no teacher present to answer questions or help adjust posture and offer suggestions. However at this time I am unable to attend any yoga classes because of my schedule. I purchased this item because I was looking for a way to work on back strength and to help with muscle soreness and strain. What I was not expecting was the number and different types of props used in the video. I was able to improvise and some of the props he uses are expensive and I have no intention of getting them.  A list of the kind of props needed or their equivalent would have been helpful - either in the Amazon description or on the back of the case.  That said, I have enjoyed the dvd and found it very easy to follow along and it is quite suitable for beginners. Although I am not a rank beginner, because of my muscle issues I found it helpful, especially before retiring for the night. Rodney explains and demonstrates the poses in a way that is easy to follow, even on the first viewing. And the pace is relaxed enough, so that someone with very tender muscles can keep up. The bonus section on sitting posture was very helpful and a good reminder about chair ergonomics and body mechanics for working while sitting on a chair at a desk.

Recently I encountered problems with my back following an accident at home. Pilates and physical therapy helped but did not take me into the progress that this program has. Because pain causes stress, it has been therapeutic for body and mind connection and designed to keep the entire back strong while promoting proper body alignment.  As a dancer I am fit and practice yoga, but I needed a gentle program and sequence to promote instead of disrupting healing.If you are a beginner to yoga, you may be a little lost, so view the program several times or begin with Rodney Yee's beginner series. I would venture to say this is gentle yoga and very therapeutic for those trying to strengthen or rehabilitate the back.There is a section designed with back care exercises includes proper body mechanics for sitting properly. The concept here is to correct the bad posture of everyday which can cause a degenerating back. Simple yoga stretches done in a chair can correct and prevent damage to our spine. Rodney Yee, alongside a physician, are  interviewed and offer advice and benefits of yoga.The program is broken down into three sections:1.exploration - simple seated stretches2. strength and flexibility gentle stretching, ie.lunges, Warrior poses, bent legged down dog3.restorative- deep undulating  breathing and relaxation, relieving tensions while resting on bolster seated in chairLearning to let go of tension is perhaps one huge element is releasing pain. Learning to break the relationship that we at times acquire with pain is part of the exploration into the self. The concept here is that at times the pain can be tied to emotions. This program has soothing calming effects as Rodney narrates each posture, with cues on proper breathing . He is surrounded by peaceful nature and water as he leads into the poses. The background music is so relaxing and as he says. "" let go"", you simply let go.Simple items may be utilized to facilitate the poses into more gentle modifications. A bolster, 2 chairs, a blanket, yoga mat, and 2 blocks, these are simple measures that don't add up to the cost of prescriptions or lengthy doctor office visits and fees.The blocks allow you to maintain just enough length as not to compromise the stretch into deeper pose if you are not ready. If you don't have a bolster, 2 pillows tied together work great. I gladly gathered the necessities and begin the program. I modified each posture to my ability.In just one session, I had m relief and that was enough to know I was on the right track to healing. I paced my workout with few poses from each section and continue to progress with it daily!
