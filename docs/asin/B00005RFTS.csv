I see Sting the person at his home.  I  feel as though I'm sitting in Sting's backyard listening to the music.  I enjoyed the rework of his classic songs.  This is a must-see concert.The concert was recorded on September 11, 2001, the day of the World Trade Center tragedy.  This is discussed during the concert and the documentary.  I found it to be sad at times.The DVD contains four songs not listed here or on the DVD.  Desert Rose, with  Cheb Mami, was omitted from the final concert but is available in Chapter 32 of the documentary.  (Perhaps the sexy belly dancer was thought to be inappropriate due to the tragedy.)  I'm glad they included it, it is one of my favorite songs.  The other three songs are:  Every Little Thing She Does is Magic; Fill Her Up; and Englishman in New York.The DVD is in full anamorphic widescreen.  I find the video and audio quality of the  DVD to be excellent.  The 70 minute documentary is as worth watching as the concert.  It would be a mistake to call it an extra, it's part of the show!  In  fact, I recommend watching the documentary first.  (When you see the red circle  with an ""S"" in the lower right hand corner during the documentary, press ENTER  if you want to hear the whole song.  The DVD will switch to the concert and then  switch back to the documentary after the song is over.)

679203,A14SO48SN83R3U,B00005RFTS,Darren,"[20, 20]","It's a ten day international slumber party and week of brainstorming and rehearsing at Sting's place!The documentary portion starts with the international musicians arriving to Sting's Italian villa in the hills of Tuscany in preparation for a concert to be performed on his property on the eve of September 11th, 2001. This portion chronicles exactly how the concert came together and how Sting and the musicians he assembled for the project all worked together to reinvent and rework songs of his solo career and those from his days with the Police. The process is an interesting and vivid illustration of musical and creative Synchronicity in action.With the news of the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, the first part of the DVD turns out to be a time capsule which documents the fear and confusion of the day and a world changed forever. The meeting Sting has with his visiting musicians about whether they wish to proceed with the concert that they so enthusiastically and energetically rehearsed and planned is heartwrenching and gets very close to looking and sounding like group psychotherapy.The resulting concert (the second part of the DVD), although somewhat mellowed by the tragic events of that day becomes a musical healing process for this group of creative international artists and of a frightened and confused new world. The concert appropriately begins with Fragile. Although the melancholic mood fades somewhat as the band plays on, the energy levels just can't rise to a joyous and celebratory level. The musical synergy between all the artists, however is fantastic throughout. The concert ends up being a touching and intimate musical tribute to thousands who have died earlier in the day.All This Time DVD chronicles a creative and healing life process and the result is a mature, soothing, introspective, and 'jazzy' reinvention of Sting's music. If you must choose between the DVD and the audio CD, go for the DVD as the entire process is missed on the audio CD.

Recorded in Sting's backyard in Italy, it's a concert that almost didn't take place. Recorded on that fateful day in 2001, Sting nearly called it off. Wisely, it's my feeling, Sting and his band chose to go on with the show. Nothing can bring people together in times of sorrow better than music. Memories of that day still haunt us all, but this simple event in the backyard of Sting's villa proves that even on that day, there were people who believed in a better world. We, as human beings, share our grief and our joy. Regardless of what color your skin is or which country you hail from, that day taught us all the meaning of love and companionship.

The relaxed friendship Sting has with the musicians makes you feel you are hanging out with old friends.One of my favorite tracks utilises Stings hallway where the acoustics are superb, the colors are warm and intimate and the musicians play with sensitivity and emotion.The concert itself is outside in the simplest of settings-coloured lights reflecting off the wall and fairy lights strung across to subtly light the scenes.The musicianship is superb as Sting has assembled the best musicians and reworked with them some of his older stuff. We see a warmer, relaxed, mellow Sting with a soothing resonant voice.The challenge the group has when Sept 11 has its impact is sensitively handled. It is a pity that the singer who could have injected a positive Middle Eastern feel to the final concert, decides he cant go on.

679212,A1IANEBSMVGHS9,B00005RFTS,"Manny Hernandez ""@askmanny""","[2, 2]","This DVD is the companion to the album of the same name with which Sting came back on September 11 (he respectfully dedicates it to the victims of the tragedy). This time around he revisits tunes from all his periods (The Police, early and late solo material) but with a very jazzy feel to most of the songs. What can be said about this concert video, that has not been said about Sting at some point? It's brilliant: he grabs his songs and virtually reinvents them, to the point where they sound almost like different songs.Particularly enjoyable I found his beautiful rendition of the Police classics ""Don't stand so close to me"" and ""Roxanne"" as well as the tracks included from his least popular album, 'Mercury Falling' and the mix of ""A Thousand Years"" and ""Perfect Love... Gone Wrong,"" much in the same style of his earlier live double-album. Interesting results his Traffic-like version of his very own ""If you love somebody set them free""... Grrrrooovy!!!! New tracks anyone? Yes!

The intro interweaves with the concert tracks by means of a cue you are given on the screen to play the corresponding song, so that you can ""see"" what it is that Sting and his band are talking about.

679218,A1T4IVIH6NUEXF,B00005RFTS,sand-da-man,"[4, 6]","As an inveterate Sting fan, I often overlook what others might criticize, but not so this time. This package should be assessed for the two parts which comprise it: the documentary and the concert. The first, documentary portion is amazingly revealing and a real treat. Filmed during the week prior to the concert, the setting is picturesque. Sting talks to us from the various rooms of his Italian villa, as the glorious Tuscan countryside looms in the background. His remarks are informative, insightful and candid, indicating a willingness to display more of his inner-self as he grows older and mellows. He also allows for a very accurate picture of music backstage (reminiscent of the ''Bring On the Night'' video that was done in 1985). Interspersed between the cameos of the various band members, who also make comments on camera, we see the magic of arrangements-in-the making and complete versions of some, including the music video of Fragile, both as it was conceived and in its final form.The second, more lengthy, live concert portion is less satisfying. In the wake of 9/11, which occurred the day before, the band is noticeably affected, as is Sting. It was courageous that the group decided to ""go on with the show,"" but it seems to me just as important to note that Sting suffers markedly here from a very weakened voice. While the reasons for that condition are  understandable (he rehearsed all week, then was extremely weary due to the stress of the tragedy), they don't change the fact that he is simply not at his best. The modified renditions of familiar Sting, including Police-era, classics are entertaining, made even more interesting by the varied instrumentation (the addition of a cello and pedal steel guitar, for example), but given the circumstances, their presentation is not quite up to the master's usual standard. The exceptions are the ""additional selections"" on the DVD that were actually performed the day before at the dress rehearsal.  In particular, Sting, bursting with energy, sounds exceptional on ""Every Little Thing She Does."" By the next day, however, the contrast in the quality of the whole performance is pronounced.  Although we are afforded the rare opportunity to see an artist in an uncommonly sensitive and vulnerable condition, it is not without cost: his enthusiasm and ability have been measurably crippled.  The moment is poignant, but he is, after all, a singer, not an actor. It is the music that has drawn us to him over the years. And that is the point.  No matter how sympathetic we may feel about the situation, Sting just doesn't sound very good.The All This Time DVD is certainly worth witnessing: You'll learn more about this great singer/songwriter and further appreciate his genius.

It is one of those enormously emotional products I love that I feel inadequate to review; however, that is the best reason for reviewing it.I believe most people know that this concert was held in Sting's home in Italy, that he and his gifted band had been practicing for less than 2 weeks and that they had to decide whether to go on and do the show knowing of the horrific events of that day (September 11, 2001.) Besides the music, their discussion of this decision is one of the highlights of this DVD. ""Fragile,"" dedicated to the victims is the opening song and it is played and sung PERFECTLY with tenderness, respect and musical brilliance. The entire DVD sound and picture quality is second to none I've ever seen, the songs are slightly different than we've heard them (more jazzy/bluesy) and it is a change that shows how much Sting has grown as an person, not just an artist.  The band he has put together is entirely and impressively gifted, coming from  around the world--Brazil, Argentina, Algeria, France, England, North America and more. Each one adds to the magical eclecticism of the music and atmosphere. They comprise an entertaining and interesting group of musicians to watch AND listen to.I have always respected Sting but never so much than after seeing this.  The DVD is absolutely flawless.  I can't give a higher recommendation.  This is my highest recommendation. On a 1-10 scale with 1 the worst and 10 the best.  This tops even a ten.  There are really no words to express all of my feelings.  STING...ALL THIS TIME must be EXPERIENCED.  Whether or not you are a fan of Sting is irrelevant, because AFTER you watch this you WILL BE.It has one of the best menus I've ever seen with loads of options: to play the documentary, the concert or both at the same time with a feature to hit ""S"" (enter) after each practiced song (that was chosen to use in the concert--obviously in keeping respect for the ones that had lost their lives, many tunes were omitted in the concert that are on the warmup/practice/jam sessions. Which are, by the way, enjoyable to watch.)What I want to emphasize the most is the way Sting starts off somber and respectful and ends up letting himself go inside the music whichs floods his soul with JOY, which, in turn, the rapport between him and his band sets up a chain reaction that fills everyone playing and listening with JOY.  THAT, my friends, is what Music is all About. This is so inspiring to me and I believe it will be to you too.Sting said it best, ""You know, we were all put on this earth to be happy.  We all deserve to be happy.  They can't kill our joy.  We can't let them do that.""KEEP SMILIN' AND SOAR!SOARING HEART",5,STING IS AN ARTIST IN THE TRUEST SENSE,1021248000,"05 13, 2002",2002,2746,"['review', 'been', 'locked', 'up', 'heart', 'long', 'time', 'one', 'enormously', 'emotional', 'products', 'love', 'feel', 'inadequate', 'review', 'however', 'best', 'reason', 'reviewing', 'it.I', 'believe', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'concert', 'was', 'held', 'Sting', 'home', 'Italy', 'gifted', 'band', 'had', 'been', 'practicing', 'less', '2', 'weeks', 'had', 'decide', 'go', 'do', 'show', 'knowing', 'horrific', 'events', 'day', 'September', '11', '2001', 'music', 'discussion', 'decision', 'one', 'highlights', 'DVD', 'Fragile', 'dedicated', 'victims', 'opening', 'song', 'played', 'sung', 'PERFECTLY', 'tenderness', 'respect', 'musical', 'brilliance', 'entire', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'second', 'none', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'songs', 'are', 'slightly', 'different', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'more', 'jazzy/bluesy', 'change', 'how', 'much', 'Sting', 'grown', 'person', 'not', 'just', 'artist', 'band', 'put', 'together', 'entirely', 'impressively', 'gifted', 'coming', 'world', 'Brazil', 'Argentina', 'Algeria', 'France', 'England', 'North', 'America', 'more', 'one', 'magical', 'eclecticism', 'music', 'atmosphere', 'comprise', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'group', 'musicians', 'watch', 'AND', 'listen', 'to.I', 'have', 'always', 'respected', 'Sting', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'seeing', 'DVD', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'higher', 'recommendation', 'highest', 'recommendation', '1-10', 'scale', '1', 'worst', '10', 'best', 'even', 'ten', 'are', 'really', 'words', 'express', 'feelings', 'STING', 'THIS', 'TIME', 'must', 'be', 'EXPERIENCED', 'Whether', 'not', 'are', 'fan', 'Sting', 'irrelevant', 'AFTER', 'watch', 'WILL', 'BE.It', 'one', 'best', 'menus', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'loads', 'options', 'play', 'documentary', 'concert', 'same', 'time', 'feature', 'hit', 'S', 'enter', 'practiced', 'song', 'was', 'chosen', 'use', 'concert', 'obviously', 'keeping', 'respect', 'ones', 'had', 'lost', 'lives', 'many', 'tunes', 'were', 'omitted', 'concert', 'are', 'warmup/practice/jam', 'sessions', 'are', 'way', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'What', 'want', 'emphasize', 'most', 'way', 'Sting', 'starts', 'somber', 'respectful', 'up', 'letting', 'go', 'music', 'whichs', 'floods', 'soul', 'JOY', 'turn', 'rapport', 'band', 'up', 'chain', 'reaction', 'everyone', 'playing', 'listening', 'JOY', 'THAT', 'friends', 'what', 'Music', 'About', 'so', 'inspiring', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'too.Sting', 'said', 'best', 'know', 'were', 'put', 'earth', 'be', 'happy', 'deserve', 'be', 'happy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'kill', 'joy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'do', 'KEEP', 'SMILIN', 'AND', 'SOAR', 'SOARING', 'HEART']",N/A

There is a nice balance between old and new songs and they're all good, but for me, the following stand out. ""Fragile"" is such a great song (maybe Sting's best) but this version is dripping with empathy and blows the studio version out of the water. The back-to-back jazz and blues punch of ""Seven Days"" and ""The Hounds Of Winter"" is stunning. ""Fields Of Gold"" has a soothing melody line that mentally transports you to that field. Finally, the smokin' hot band pulls out all the stops on ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"".As for the quality of the DVD, the video is crystal clear, the editing has smooth transitions between cuts, and the audio mix is spectacular.
