1172523,A32RF0KJA4ZE6E,B001BN4WA4,Alanna Evans,"[9, 10]","ARIA is a beautifully crafted piece of anime, brought to life by Junichi Sato (Sailor Moon, Kaliedo Star and others).  His optimistic characters shine through and this ""slice of life"" series about gondoliers on a foreign idyllic water planet called Aqua has life and substance.  The stories are as light as air, and deal with three girls and their mentors as they train their hardest and most earnestly to become Prima Undines, gondaliers who scull boats through the water canals of a Neo-Venice.The color and art design are breathtaking, water lapping, gorgeous blues and golds washing the screen to give a cool, soft feel.  There are the typical episodes, such as the one where the girls go on a mission to train, but the training turns out to be different than they expect.  A cat goes missing.  There's a trip back into time to see the past in the present's eyes.  There is the hot springs episode, the holiday episode... but its all well done and has a calm, uplifting feel to it all.Those who enjoyed series such as Haibane Remnei, Somedays Dreamers and other slow moving, slice of life series will find themselves right at home here.  It's calming, beautiful to watch and has a charming sense to it too.All 13 episodes are represented from the first season/series.  Japanese language with English subtitles (there is NO dub).  An array of bonus features populate the four discs, including one that shows clips of the director in Venice (with commentary) by Sato, which is quite entertaining.",4,"Calm, Peaceful and Lovely...",1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,1498,"['ARIA', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'piece', 'anime', 'brought', 'life', 'Junichi', 'Sato', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'Kaliedo', 'Star', 'others', 'optimistic', 'characters', 'shine', 'slice', 'life', 'series', 'gondoliers', 'foreign', 'idyllic', 'water', 'planet', 'called', 'Aqua', 'life', 'substance', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'light', 'air', 'deal', 'three', 'girls', 'mentors', 'train', 'hardest', 'most', 'earnestly', 'become', 'Prima', 'Undines', 'gondaliers', 'who', 'scull', 'boats', 'water', 'canals', 'Neo-Venice.The', 'color', 'art', 'design', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'water', 'lapping', 'gorgeous', 'blues', 'golds', 'washing', 'screen', 'give', 'cool', 'soft', 'feel', 'are', 'typical', 'episodes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'girls', 'go', 'mission', 'train', 'training', 'out', 'be', 'different', 'expect', 'cat', 'missing', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'see', 'past', 'present', 'eyes', 'hot', 'springs', 'episode', 'holiday', 'episode', 'well', 'done', 'calm', 'uplifting', 'feel', 'all.Those', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'such', 'Haibane', 'Remnei', 'Somedays', 'Dreamers', 'other', 'slow', 'moving', 'slice', 'life', 'series', 'will', 'find', 'right', 'home', 'here', 'calming', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'charming', 'sense', 'too.All', '13', 'episodes', 'are', 'represented', 'first', 'season/series', 'Japanese', 'language', 'English', 'subtitles', 'NO', 'dub', 'array', 'bonus', 'features', 'populate', 'four', 'discs', 'including', 'one', 'clips', 'director', 'Venice', 'commentary', 'Sato', 'quite', 'entertaining']",Aria the Animation Season 1
1172524,A1PKLIA9LPLY6Q,B001BN4WA4,"Amazon Customer ""orielwindowster""","[1, 3]","It's rather hard to explain this anime. If you are a fan of Azumanga Daioh, you will appreciate the rather slow moving, meandering story line. It's nice to see the beautiful animation and the characters and music all flow nicely. My only complaint is that it does border a little bit on a little too much simplicity. There were a few times where my attention started to waver. Also, having been to Venice a few times, I did like the concept of recreating that city on another planet, but at times the buildings and background seemed a little too bland. I did enjoy this anime, but I don't think many people would do the extreme slow pace. However I am looking forward to season 2, to see if they up the ante a little with some more complex stories and character developement.",4,nice little anime,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",2008,775,"['rather', 'hard', 'explain', 'anime', 'are', 'fan', 'Azumanga', 'Daioh', 'will', 'appreciate', 'rather', 'slow', 'moving', 'meandering', 'story', 'line', 'nice', 'see', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'characters', 'music', 'flow', 'nicely', 'only', 'complaint', 'border', 'little', 'bit', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'simplicity', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'attention', 'started', 'waver', 'Also', 'having', 'been', 'Venice', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'concept', 'recreating', 'city', 'planet', 'times', 'buildings', 'background', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'bland', 'did', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'do', 'extreme', 'slow', 'pace', 'However', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'season', '2', 'see', 'up', 'ante', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'stories', 'character', 'developement']",Aria the Animation Season 1

1172526,A3LIWTQDSQ5UOO,B001BN4WA4,"Jonathan Oyama ""Welcome to die!""","[2, 2]","""Aria"" is one of those series that drifts along without much of a plotline, but it's so beautiful that it doesn't need one.The main story focuses on Akari Mizunashi, who is training to become an Undine, a professional gondolier and tour guide for Aqua. She works for the Aria gondola company in Neo-Venezia. However, she spends most of her time chatting and relaxing with her friends, the hard-working Aika and the shy, reserved high school student Alice.However, Aqua itself is one of the most scenic planets, due to the wide expanse of water surrounding the entire planet. Believe or not, the planet actually becomes a character in this series, with plenty of mysterious spirits.Because of the gorgeous backgrounds, the detailed character designs and the incredible voice actors, ""Aria"" is a masterpiece of art--it's the most wonderful oceanic utopia in an anime.And Akari, her friends and her mentors make for excellent characters. One especially touching episode centers on the three gondolier mentors telling Akari, Aika and Alice how they became close friends when they were young. It's a nostalgic and impressive character analysis of the laid back gondolier Alicia, the perfectionist Alicia and the clumsy diva Athena.With a lovable cast of characters and one of the most relaxing landscapes, it's no surprise that ""Aria"" is one of the best anime of 2008. I look forward to watching season two of ""Aria"" as well.The season set is packed with great special features as well, such as interviews with the Japanese voice actors, clean opening and ending sequences and a special set of episodes called ""Venice, I'm sorry!"" These episodes document director Sato's trip to Venice, and how he integrated these shots into the anime. Also keep in mind that there are no dubs--the entire series is in Japanese.",5,Relaxing on a gondola in Neo-Venezia,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,1807,"['Aria', 'one', 'series', 'along', 'much', 'plotline', 'so', 'beautiful', ""n't"", 'need', 'one.The', 'main', 'story', 'focuses', 'Akari', 'Mizunashi', 'who', 'training', 'become', 'Undine', 'professional', 'gondolier', 'tour', 'guide', 'Aqua', 'Aria', 'gondola', 'company', 'Neo-Venezia', 'However', 'most', 'time', 'chatting', 'relaxing', 'friends', 'hard-working', 'Aika', 'shy', 'reserved', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Alice.However', 'Aqua', 'one', 'most', 'scenic', 'planets', 'due', 'wide', 'expanse', 'water', 'surrounding', 'entire', 'planet', 'Believe', 'not', 'planet', 'actually', 'character', 'series', 'plenty', 'mysterious', 'spirits.Because', 'gorgeous', 'backgrounds', 'detailed', 'character', 'designs', 'incredible', 'voice', 'actors', 'Aria', 'masterpiece', 'art', 'most', 'wonderful', 'oceanic', 'utopia', 'anime.And', 'Akari', 'friends', 'mentors', 'make', 'excellent', 'characters', 'One', 'especially', 'touching', 'episode', 'centers', 'three', 'gondolier', 'mentors', 'telling', 'Akari', 'Aika', 'Alice', 'how', 'became', 'close', 'friends', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'nostalgic', 'impressive', 'character', 'analysis', 'laid', 'back', 'gondolier', 'Alicia', 'perfectionist', 'Alicia', 'clumsy', 'diva', 'Athena.With', 'lovable', 'cast', 'characters', 'one', 'most', 'relaxing', 'landscapes', 'surprise', 'Aria', 'one', 'best', 'anime', '2008', 'look', 'forward', 'watching', 'season', 'two', 'Aria', 'well.The', 'season', 'set', 'packed', 'great', 'special', 'features', 'well', 'such', 'interviews', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actors', 'clean', 'opening', 'ending', 'sequences', 'special', 'set', 'episodes', 'called', 'Venice', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'episodes', 'document', 'director', 'Sato', 'trip', 'Venice', 'how', 'integrated', 'shots', 'anime', 'Also', 'keep', 'mind', 'are', 'dubs', 'entire', 'series', 'Japanese']",Aria the Animation Season 1
