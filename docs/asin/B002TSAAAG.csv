Today their comedy stands the test of time with their flippant mannerism that were certain to disrupt any serious concern in the scene by scene silliness.In truth it has been this method of conflict that washed into out street antics of the 60s and scared the shorts off of our political agenda.

1288684,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B002TSAAAG,calvinnme,"[29, 30]","The two really great films that the Marx Brothers did after they left Paramount were ""A Night at the Opera"" (the best IMHO) and ""A Day at the Races"". These two have Margaret Dumont sparring with Groucho as usual.  ""Races"" and ""Opera"" were the two films that boy genius Irving Thalberg supervised after personally wooing the Marx's to come to MGM in the first place. Louis B. Mayer really had no use for the brothers, and it shows in the kinds of films they were given after Thalberg died in 1936. The best of the Marx Brothers are what they did at Paramount, still with us inThe Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection (The Cocoanuts / Animal Crackers / Monkey Business / Horse Feathers / Duck Soup). The Marx Brothers were iconoclasts at heart, and after the production code began to be enforced they really had no home in motion pictures. I think Irving Thalberg was wrong to think that the problem was that the brothers never helped anyone in their movies, but the formula he came up with in ""Opera"" and ""Races"" did make their comedy work in the age of the code.""At the Circus"" and ""A Night in Casablanca"" are OK. On the bright side ""At the Circus"" has Margaret Dumont. On the not so bright side it is infected with musical numbers that are, quite frankly, boring. ""A Night in Casablanca"" almost gets the boys back to the quality they had in the mid 30's under Thalberg, so it is worthwhile viewing, although it does lend a generosity to the boys that simply does not fit their brand of humor.""Room Service"" (1938) is actually an RKO film, so for once no musical numbers. This script was not written especially for the brothers, it was one of the few films they did with adapted material. The humor is OK, but it just doesn't seem like a Marx Brothers film.In my opinionThe Marx Brothers Collection (A Night at The Opera/A Day at The Races/A Night in Casablanca/Room Service/At the Circus/Go West/The Big Store)is a more complete picture of the film career of the Marx Brothers after the code. It has plenty of extra features and it is often on sale for about the same price as this set, plus you get seven films, not just four.",4,How could they omit A Night at the Opera?,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,2130,"['two', 'really', 'great', 'films', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'did', 'left', 'Paramount', 'were', 'Night', 'Opera', 'best', 'IMHO', 'Day', 'Races', 'two', 'have', 'Margaret', 'Dumont', 'sparring', 'Groucho', 'usual', 'Races', 'Opera', 'were', 'two', 'films', 'boy', 'genius', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'supervised', 'personally', 'wooing', 'Marx', 'come', 'MGM', 'first', 'place', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'really', 'had', 'use', 'brothers', 'kinds', 'films', 'were', 'given', 'Thalberg', 'died', '1936', 'best', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'are', 'what', 'did', 'Paramount', 'still', 'inThe', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Silver', 'Screen', 'Collection', 'Cocoanuts', '/', 'Animal', 'Crackers', '/', 'Monkey', 'Business', '/', 'Horse', 'Feathers', '/', 'Duck', 'Soup', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'were', 'iconoclasts', 'heart', 'production', 'code', 'began', 'be', 'enforced', 'really', 'had', 'home', 'motion', 'pictures', 'think', 'Irving', 'Thalberg', 'was', 'wrong', 'think', 'problem', 'was', 'brothers', 'never', 'helped', 'anyone', 'movies', 'formula', 'came', 'up', 'Opera', 'Races', 'did', 'make', 'comedy', 'work', 'age', 'code', 'Circus', 'Night', 'Casablanca', 'are', 'OK.', 'bright', 'side', 'Circus', 'Margaret', 'Dumont', 'not', 'so', 'bright', 'side', 'infected', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'quite', 'frankly', 'boring', 'Night', 'Casablanca', 'almost', 'boys', 'back', 'quality', 'had', 'mid', '30', 'Thalberg', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'lend', 'generosity', 'boys', 'simply', 'not', 'fit', 'brand', 'humor', 'Room', 'Service', '1938', 'actually', 'RKO', 'film', 'so', 'once', 'musical', 'numbers', 'script', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'especially', 'brothers', 'was', 'one', 'few', 'films', 'did', 'adapted', 'material', 'humor', 'OK', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'film.In', 'opinionThe', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Collection', 'A', 'Night', 'Opera/A', 'Day', 'Races/A', 'Night', 'Casablanca/Room', 'Service/At', 'Circus/Go', 'West/The', 'Big', 'Store', 'more', 'complete', 'picture', 'film', 'career', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'code', 'plenty', 'extra', 'features', 'often', 'sale', 'same', 'price', 'set', 'get', 'seven', 'films', 'not', 'just', 'four']",TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Marx Brothers (A Day at the Races / A Night in Casablanca / Room Service / At the Circus)

Of the four films included, one is among their very best (&#34;A Day at the Races&#34;), one is quite good (&#34;A Night in Casablanca&#34;), and two are okay, but still very watchable (&#34;Room Service&#34; and &#34;At the Circus&#34;).  The latter two are a bit slower and more &#34;stagey&#34; than the others, but still offer their rewards.If you're not familiar with the Marx Brothers, this is a good introduction to their peculiar zaniness: puns, wacky practical jokes, physical comedy, sexual innuendo, and musicianship (Chico on piano, Harpo on, well, on the harp!) -- all in the service of a pair of lovers who are being targeted by villains bent on framing or robbing them.  If you're the sort of person who can't enjoy the Marx Brothers, then you have my sincere sympathy.These films come two to a disc, one on either side.

I watched the first one last night ""Room Service"" and it is still one of my favorites. I was skeptical at first when I saw that four movies were bundled together, but I found the quality of the prints to be surprisingly clean, plus you also get wacky cartoons like The Daffy Doc (1938) with a young and crazy Daffy Duck & Porky Pig and Our Gang comedies as well along with movie trailers. An excellent bargain for the price. The reason A Night At The Opera is not included was probably because it is a major movie and that one in itself is full of various extra features as well. You can buy that one at bargain prices as well. Stop complaining! People used to pay $25 for one movie 25 years ago.
