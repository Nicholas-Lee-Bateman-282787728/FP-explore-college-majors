Just read on!In a time of brave knights, powerful queens and treacherous kings, Arn, a skilled swordsman, is sent to war as a Knight Templar, while Cecilia, the love of his life, is imprisoned in a convent.Recently, thanks to the recommendation of a friend of mine, I discovered a wondrous, magnificent show on Netflix. This show is beautifully titled Arn: The Knight Templar.  >>>>>>Upon watching the first episode, I was captured. Oh, my, how this show has so enraptured me I could watch it over and over. Not to mention the awesome cover! >>>>>>>>>>>>>Such beautiful landscapes, characters, and plots, it's next to impossible for this show not to draw one in!This is actually the first foreign show that I've ever watched, it being Swedish. Ninety percent of the time, the viewer is reading subtitles. However, this does not detract from the visualization. If anything it enhances it, for it allows the dialogue to remain with you for some time.Now to the nitty-gritty.Language - very mild language used infrequently; ""h*ll"", ""cr*p""; one use of the s-word at the end of the series. 3/5Sexual content - a woman comes to a man and enters his bed, she begins to force herself on him, though this lasts momentarily. No nudity is shown. A man and a woman have sex (nothing but a man's torso and a woman's shoulders is shown) and it is said later that the woman is pregnant. A man is excommunicated for allegedly committing adultery with two women; a woman is sent to a convent for being with a man outside of marriage. 3/5Violence - Mild. Severed hands, heads, etc... A horse is slain. 2/5Scary Images - ^^^ 2/5All things considered, Arn: The Knight templar is a must see for any lovers of foreign medieval dramas who aren't afraid of a little love or a little blood.

1532597,A1LKQ81O0BP49Q,B007K7IB84,Dr. Miguel Faria,"[3, 3]","The Knight Templar (The Complete Series) is a spectacular epic based on the Crusades trilogy written by Swedish author and journalist, Jan Guillou. It features the fictional character, Arn Magnusson, a young Swedish nobleman, who becomes a Knight Templar as penance for having had a love affair with the maiden Cecilia. Cecilia is in turn sequestered in a monastery for twenty years of long penance, throughout which she remains loyal and devoted to Arn.During this time, Arn becomes a great warrior in the Holy Land, participating in many historical events with true historical characters. The complete series, a 6-part DVD miniseries, is a fabulous, epic saga masterpiece. The time sequence spans approximately the same time as &#34;The Kingdom of Heaven&#34; film, which I have also reviewed. This is a tumultuous period after the Second Crusade, encompassing the fall of Jerusalem to the Saracens, and up to the commencement of the Third Crusade.After Arn returns to his homeland in Gotaland, Sweden, he is forced to defend his clan against the contentions of a rival to the Swedish throne, a rival king who is supported by the Danish monarchy. A civil war ensues....The DVD cover describes the plot accurately and succinctly: &#34;In a land of brave knights, powerful queens and treacherous kings, Arn Magnusson, a skilled swordsman, is sent off to war as a Knight Templar as a penance for his sins. Separated from his love true love by a jealous nobleman, Arn must battle a cruel and violent world to survive.&#34; I recommend this series to adventure as well as  fans of romance with historical inclinations.Miguel A. Faria Jr., M.D. is a medical historian, and an Associate Editor in Chief and World Affairs Editor of Surgical Neurology International (SNI).

This is a movie you can savor; spun out thoughtfully, without pandering to sensationalism or sacrificing authenticity for the sake of gratifying modern sensibilities.  &#34;Arn&#34; is a film where the story arises from character, and the characters are full-realized humans.

This film is what a historical film should be, in my opinion.The film is subtitled, as some reviewers have mentioned with chagrin. If you haven't the patience for reading subtitles, then be warned. For myself,  I found that I forgot I was reading subtitles, almost before the first scene ended.  The flavor of the film would be less, I think, without the cadence and color of the various languages spoken throughout.

I see it's only been available since June. I have had the two-hour American-release movie for some time now and have always liked it quite a lot, however I was aware that a lot of information was missing and/or glossed over. It was frustrating not to be able to know what I was missing.Watching this full series double-DVD was wonderful, like finally scratching an itch that you just couldn't ever reach. I like the way more of the minor characters are given time to develop, it makes the full film more satisfying. Especially interesting to me is the secondary character of the Norwegian Templar Harald ysteinsson, and his relationship to Arn Magnusson. Harald scarcely exists in the condensed American film version, but is well-developed in this full series version.The only complaint I have is that toward the end it is shown that a bunch of Arabs came back to Sweden with Arn following his time as a Templar in the Holy Land. This is a serious historically inaccurate flaw. This would never have happened (Arabs living in Sweden in the 1100s). It smacks of having politically correct token Arab characters shoe-horned into the plot in order to make nice with the growing Arab population in modern Sweden. It was stupid, and it detracts from the overall presentation.Sort of like when Morgan Freeman was cast in Robin Hood. I like Morgan Freeman, but it was simply historically inaccurate. There weren't any black people in the British Isles back then.",4,"Fills in the ""Blank Spots""",1355788800,"12 18, 2012",2012,1604,"['was', 'unaware', 'existence', 'full', 'set', 'Arn', 'series', 'U.S.', 'someone', 'recently', 'emailed', ""'m"", 'grateful', 'did', 'see', 'only', 'been', 'available', 'June', 'have', 'had', 'two-hour', 'American-release', 'movie', 'time', 'now', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'quite', 'lot', 'however', 'was', 'aware', 'lot', 'information', 'was', 'missing', 'and/or', 'glossed', 'was', 'frustrating', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'missing.Watching', 'full', 'series', 'double-DVD', 'was', 'wonderful', 'finally', 'scratching', 'itch', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'ever', 'reach', 'way', 'more', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'time', 'develop', 'full', 'film', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Especially', 'interesting', 'secondary', 'character', 'Norwegian', 'Templar', 'Harald', 'ysteinsson', 'relationship', 'Arn', 'Magnusson', 'Harald', 'scarcely', 'condensed', 'American', 'film', 'version', 'well-developed', 'full', 'series', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'end', 'shown', 'bunch', 'Arabs', 'came', 'back', 'Sweden', 'Arn', 'following', 'time', 'Templar', 'Holy', 'Land', 'serious', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'flaw', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'happened', 'Arabs', 'living', 'Sweden', '1100s', 'having', 'politically', 'correct', 'token', 'Arab', 'characters', 'shoe-horned', 'plot', 'order', 'make', 'nice', 'growing', 'Arab', 'population', 'modern', 'Sweden', 'was', 'stupid', 'overall', 'presentation.Sort', 'when', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'cast', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'like', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'was', 'simply', 'historically', 'inaccurate', 'were', ""n't"", 'black', 'people', 'British', 'Isles', 'back', 'then']",N/A
