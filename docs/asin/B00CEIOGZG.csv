Based on a parable-like story by Isak Dinesen, this is a quiet, meditative film: one of the few I know that offers a vision of human goodness that is honest and not mawkish. Watching the movie is like a brief visit to a strange country where one adapts but then must leave too soon. As always with Criterion, no expense has been spared in restoring the film's elements and adding beaucoup special features. If you are a collector of fine films, Criterion's presentation of ""Babette's Feast"" deserves a place among them.",5,Magnificent Delicacy,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2014,655,"['kind', 'film', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'was', 'made', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'elegantly', 'simple', 'exquisite', 'foreign', 'film', 'Based', 'parable-like', 'story', 'Isak', 'Dinesen', 'quiet', 'meditative', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'know', 'vision', 'human', 'goodness', 'honest', 'not', 'mawkish', 'Watching', 'movie', 'brief', 'visit', 'strange', 'country', 'where', 'one', 'adapts', 'then', 'must', 'leave', 'too', 'soon', 'always', 'Criterion', 'expense', 'been', 'spared', 'restoring', 'film', 'elements', 'adding', 'beaucoup', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'collector', 'fine', 'films', 'Criterion', 'presentation', 'Babette', 'Feast', 'place']",N/A

The restoration and transfer were done properly, and the result is praiseworthy.  Crisp details; good color saturation; realistic flesh tones; deep blacks, etc.  There are a few artifacts at the beginning of the movie, during the title sequence.  But they are the exception.  Apart from a grainy scene or two in lowlight conditions, the movie has just the right amount of film grain.  The soundtrack is also improved over the DVD version.  It has been scrubbed clean of hisses and pops.  This is what a Blu-ray transfer of an older movie should look and sound like.If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is totally worth it.

With newly restored video and audio, along with a new English subtitle translation, Babette's Feast has finally gotten the attention this wonderful film deserves!For those who do not know, this is the story of a French housekeeper in a remote Danish village.  She works for two sisters who live together, the daughters of the founder of a fundamentalist religious sect.  When Babette learns she has won a great deal of money she decides to celebrate with a feast for the members of the sect.  This feast provides the setting for the great contrasts the movie explores: asceticism versus indulgence, grace versus law, friendship versus suspicion, mercy versus righteousness.  At the wonderful hospitality of Babette's table we experience not only great food but also the way that these contrasts might live in harmony.  We experience, in other words, the miracle that men and women might learn to dwell together in peace and love through the simple acts of giving, sacrifice, and the choice to enjoy life.This is a feast for the eyes as well as the heart.  Enjoy the meal!This Blu-Ray release includes the following features (taken from the Criterion Collection webpage):-New 2K digital film restoration, with 2.0 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition-New interview with actor St&eacute;phane Audran-Karen Blixen: Storyteller, a 1995 documentary about the author of the film's source story, who wrote under the pen name Isak Dinesen-New visual essay by filmmaker Michael Almereyda-New interview with sociologist Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson about the significance of cuisine in French culture-Trailer-New and improved English subtitle translation-PLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by film scholar Mark Le Fanu and Dinesen's 1950 story(Edit and Update)Having now received and seen the Criterion Bluray, I can say with all excitement that this is exactly what I'd hoped it would be!

1646201,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00CEIOGZG,K. Reynolds,"[9, 9]","THIS IS NOT a movie about food. It is not a movie about religion either, although the story revolves around a pair of sisters who belong to a strict, Puritanical sect.""It's true that food is important, but there's a nourishment in a spiritual sense,"" actress St&eacute;phane Audran, who plays Babette, says in the 2012 interview on this new Criterion edition.It is ""a film that advocates love from start to finish,"" director/scriptwriter Gabriel Axel agrees in his 2013 interview. For him, the most important thing was to capture Karen Blixen's voice.Who is Karen Blixen? She is the woman who wrote the story published in 1950 under the pen name Isak Dinesen. Axel says the charming fable was recommended by his wife. But, when he tried to get financing for making it, he was roundly turned down.It took over 15 years - and seven Oscar wins for a movie about Dinesen, ""Out of Africa,"" (1985) - before producers agreed to finance ""Babette's Feast."" Shot in Jutland in Denmark, it became an Oscar winner for 1988 Best Foreign Film and just about every other classy international award that year.The story takes place in a bleak coastal village, where two aging sisters, Martine (Birgitte Federspiel) and Fillipa (Bodil Kjer), care for the remainder of their minister father's elderly and quarrelsome followers. Both were beauties in their younger years, and, through flashbacks, we see how both gave up marriage opportunities to stay with their father.Skip ahead 35 years and we find the minister has passed on. One evening, a woman appears at the door with a letter from one of the former suitors. Babette is a refugee from the French civil war (Hello, fans of ""Les Mis&eacute;rables,"" 2012); she needs a home. Would the ladies consider taking her on as a maid?They do and, soon, Babette is cleaning and cooking. This goes on for more than 10 years until the day comes when the sisters plan to celebrate what would have been their father's 100th birthday - and Babette wins the French lottery, 10,000 francs. Certain the woman who has grown to be an irreplaceable friend will now leave, they agree to let Babette use her winnings to put on the birthday feast as a thank you for their kindness.Still, Martine, Fillipa, and the disciples fear they may be heading into a witch's Sabbath as Babette's exotic supplies arrive. But a promise is a promise, and to this symbolic Last Supper, they must go. That's where the not-to-be-missed culmination of the tale takes place.Criterion presents ""Babette's Feast"" on Blu-ray using a new 2K digital transfer and it looks sublime. Axel tells us he was, ""inspired by Vermeer's palette ... all the colors of the earth ... with nothing to distract from what was essential."" Color is rich and varied, gradually shifting from a soft gray and blue palette to rich jewel colors as the feast takes place. Detail and film grain are perfect for this production.The multilingual soundtrack - Danish and French with English subtitles - has been upgraded to a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track. Dialogue, music and score come through cleanly with a reasonable amount of range.In addition to the interviews, the disc provides a 90-minute, 1995 documentary, ""Karen Blixen - Story Teller."" ""Table Scraps"" tell us about making and filming the feast. In her interview, Audran describes how it was also prepared and served during the film's promotional tour and Oscar campaign. Meals in New York and Los Angeles were sublime. ""Americans like to get it right,"" she says.""An Artist of the Everyday"" presents a 2013 interview with sociology professor Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson, about the importance of ""cuisine"" to the French identity and to ""Babette's Feast."" Criterion has also packed in a 64 page booklet with an essay by Mark Le Fanu and Blixen's original story.No matter the nationality, from America to Denmark, viewers share a profound reaction to ""Babette's Feast,"" Axel tells us.He is right. This is a loving tribute to anyone who has experienced some ups and downs in their life, and brings something new with each viewing.

1646202,A308QC9XPFHFGJ,B00CEIOGZG,"Malfoyfan ""Cath""","[1, 1]","It's so great to have this excellent movie on Blu-ray at last!  We've been watching our ancient VHS of Babette's Feast and I was hoping to one day be able to own it on DVD.  The quality of the picture is excellent.For those who don't know, Babette's Feast is based on a short story by Karen Blixen, who wrote under the pen name Isak Dinesen, and tells the story of a female French chef who is driven from her home in Paris by political upheaval and ends up taking shelter with, and working for, two elderly Danish spinsters in a remote village. She wins a French lottery and asks the ladies if she may use the money to prepare a dinner for the anniversary of their late pastor father's birthday, to which his elderly parishioners are invited, along with an old acquaintance of the two women.  Babette makes them an unforgettable dinner, after which she confesses she used her entire lottery winnings and will be staying with them (they assumed she would return to Paris after receiving the money).Although some might find the movie slow, I loved it from the first time I saw it.  The actors, some of whom I recognized from Ingmar Bergman movies, are all excellent, particularly Stephane Audran as Babette and Jarl Kulle as the General.  The story is funny, poignant, strange and uplifting by turns.  It's worth watching just for the depiction of the dinner.

(A friend was so eager to see it that it's been out on loan to her for several weeks.)  Fortunately, it arrived encased with a pair of booklets, one of which is the text of the original novella.  So I did read it, for the first time.  The film, as I remember it, is extremely faithful to the story. But for once, I liked the film even better.  It (the DVD) does such a beautiful job of showing the poignancy and the feast's guests emergence form their life-long gloom. Babette's ultimate fate is left somewhat up in the air; but that is not the subject of the story.  The ending is appropriate--consistent with the author's intent and not unsatisfying. The second booklet--on ""the making of""--explains why the setting was changed from Norway to Denmark.  It doesn't seem to make a lot of difference. The scenes are dimly lit in either case.

1646206,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,B00CEIOGZG,Stanley Crowe,"[0, 0]","It's 1885.  Babette, a French refugee from the troubles of 1871, has been working as an unpaid maid and cook for fourteen years in a small village on the coast of Jutland in return for her lodging.  Her employers are two old sisters, daughters of a long-dead preacher who had founded a small Puritan sect in the village, and his daughters are trying to hold it together, even though all of its members (about 12!) are aging and becoming quarrelsome and ugly. Long ago, as very young and beautiful women, the sisters seemed to have some opportunities to make lives for themselves away from the village, but they chose not to.  Now, in 1885, in an effort to keep their small congregation together, the sisters decide to honor the centenary of their father's birth by having a modest dinner.  At this point, Babette asks for a favor: she has just won 10,000 francs in a Paris lottery ( a friend has bought a ticket in her name every year), and she asks if she may provide AND COOK the meal.  The sisters, with some reluctance, agree, and Babette tells them that she will cook a French meal . . .A lot of comment on this film sees it as an uplifting tale about grace -- about how Babette's feast lifts the little group of believers who are the recipients of the feast out of their increasingly petty little concerns into something approaching concord, which is symbolized at the end of the movie by their joining hands, dancing round the village well, and singing a hymn. All that is true as far as it goes, but I would like to stress the more paradoxical elements, for I think the movie is honest about them, even though, on the whole, it is an affirmative movie.In the kitchen where Babette is preparing the feast for her kindly but austere employers there is the coachman who has brought a couple of the more distinguished guests to the feast. Babette gives him food too, and he eats it with a relish and appreciation that the puritanical guests in the dining room can't bring themselves to acknowledge. This is comic, for the feast works its magic on the guests, who are much more well-disposed to each other after the feast than before, but it's also a bit sad, for if they have been graced, they have been graced not by God but by Babette's generosity and her awareness of what sensory pleasure can do, which is something that the little Puritan congregation denies. That they all are now old, in this 100th year of their long-dead founder's birth, is also poignant, for one is made aware during the feast of the self-limiting choices made and opportunities not taken. In particular, the presence at the feast of General Lowenhielm, who as a young officer had fallen in love with Filippa, one of the sisters, is a reminder of the costs of earlier choices. Although there is no bitterness on the part of either, I don't think that the movie at all denies that sense of that loss, thanks to the acting of Jarl Kulle as the General and Bodile Kjer as Filippa. But the General, a man who has lived in the world, also has an aesthetic appreciation of the meal -- in fact, he had tasted Babette's cooking in Paris prior to 1871 and he doesn't know that she is the cook in this remote village in Jutland -- and he makes a graceful speech in which he acknowledges the effects of the meal on the company -- something that the less-worldly guests aren't capable of doing, even though they are increasingly relaxing as the feast goes on.Filippa had feared, when she heard that Babette is going to prepare a French meal, that the appeal to the senses would be almost diabolical -- ""a witches' Sabbath,"" she says -- and had warned most of the guests beforehand, and there's something comic in the way that the guests reassure her by saying that under no circumstances will they mention the food they're eating -- and they keep their word, which is both admirable and perverse -- the coachman, after all, has no trouble being appreciative. (The General, it should be said, a last minute guest, did not hear this warning.)  So . . . the villagers never knew what hit 'em. Does that matter? To some extent it does, for they owe thanks that they are not really capable of giving. Their behavior towards one another is better -- but how long will that last? And there's something not right about Babette's not being acknowledged -- it bespeaks a limitation on their religion, and a limitation on their understanding of grace and sacrifice. The sisters at least learn of the latter, when it's revealed that Babette spent ALL of her lottery winnings on the meal -- for her, it was an act of thanks to the women who had taken her in, but it was also a free exercise of artistic expression that she had not been able to afford until she won the lottery. It's a nice touch, though, that even before that, it becomes clear that Babette's quality of cooking, even with inferior materials, so to speak, has had its effect on the poor people of the village to whom the sisters take food as an act of charity. One of my favorite moments comes during the week that Babette has taken off prior to the meal in order to get all the ingredients together. The sisters do the cooking themselves for the poor -- and the poor don't like it!  It is late in the movie that Babette reveals to the sisters that in Paris she had been a chef at the famous hotel where the General had once dined.The Criterion DVD had lovely picture quality -- it's a superb looking film -- and the scenes of the village and coast have a kind of elemental sparseness to them that creates a sense of fable or fairy-tale.  There is no characterization to speak of, although everyone is easily identifiable in such a small population, and voice-over is used extensively, which adds to the fable-like quality of the story. It's tempting to compare it to Joyce's ""The Dead,"" filmed by John Huston, for there too a meal stands at the center of the story as a token of the richness that the present has to offer to people hung up on the past, as Irish of the time were prone to be.  In ""Babette's Feast,"" the people are hung up on the future (in Paradise, they hope), and thus don't quite know what Babette has done for them -- and yet they reap a benefit anyway, and no-one begrudges it. A better parallel than ""The Dead,"" though, is Joyce's story ""Grace."" There a group of friends scheme to help a fallen friend. They don't discuss why they try to do this -- they just do it. And like the guests at Babette's feast, the recipient of the help doesn't know what's been done for him, doesn't know that grace has been bestowed. In that story, as in this this movie, the ""official"" religious language can't accommodate real grace in action.",5,they never knew what hit them . . .,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,6671,"['1885',
