It was like a bunch of actors doing individual screen tests & they photo-shopped it all together into one movie. The design of the film was kind of lush, maybe they put all their effort into that instead of the actual acting or direction, I don't know. I didn't get a sense of any real interaction. I would rather see something much rougher, like Brothers McMullen or something done on a shoestring & shot with handheld video but with incredible heart. This film was not that, not by a longshot. Pretty disappointing considering how great the lead actors are.The Italian spoken by the wife was like nails on a blackboard to me. I wondered if it was actually part of the script to get the flattest, deadest, creepiest, drawl-iest Italian ever spoken by a foreigner so that they could show the disconnect between him & his family or something.

995994,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000FUF6SQ,Grady Harp,"[22, 23]","'La Bestia nel cuore' ('The Beast in the Heart' released in the USA as 'Don't Tell') is an intense Italian film written and directed by Cristina Comencini that tackles subject matter so visceral that the telling of it requires complete concentration from the audience in order to feel the power of the impact at the end.  It is a tough film to watch because of the story, but it is a superb film to watch because of the excellent cast and production crew.Sabina (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) is introduced to us in a cemetery where she is arranging for the interment of her dead parents: the mood for the story is subtly set.  Sabina is a dubbing actress for translating films into Italian, a 'sell-out' acting job compared to the life of her live-in boyfriend Franco (Alessio Boni) who is a stage actor being tempted to accept a role in a TV series which pays more money than the stage. Sabina confesses she wants to get pregnant, she does, and with her pregnancy she begins to have nightmares of shadowy childhood memories.  She is afraid to discuss these with Franco, or with her best friend Emilia (Stefania Rocca) who is blind and has been in love with Sabina since childhood.  It seems the only person with whom she can confide her secret fears is her brother Daniele (Luigi Lo Cascio) who has moved from Italy to Charlottesville, VA where he is a professor at the University and has a happy family life with wife Anna (Lucy Akhurst) and two children.  Sabina flies to the US to be with her brother and in the course of their reunion the two siblings uncover the beasts in their hearts: sexual abuse from their father now departed.  How this discovery alters their lives is the d&eacute;nouement of the film.There are many subplots - infidelity on the part of Franco while Sabina is away, a lesbian relationship that develops between Emilia and another of Sabina's friends Maria (Angela Finocchiaro) - and Comencini draws subtle parallels between these twists along side the main story of incest discovery.  Yet without concentration, these subplots can become distracting.The acting is on the highest level and the changing locations are shot by cinematographer Fabio Cianchetti with sensitive respect of the nuances of suggestion encased in each place. The uncredited musical score is an admixture from Robert Schumann's piano sonata to contemporary works and serves to heighten the actions and mood.  In Italian with subtitles.  A film well worth watching.

""Don't Tell"". The Italian cinema is alive and thriving more so now than it has since the fading of the masters Fellini, De Seca, and Visconti.Film is the only great art from of the United States. We have no other artistic history that we can call truly ours. In Italy there is a great history of art and literature that is original, groundbreaking and innovative. Italian cinema as more in common with American film than it does with the rest of Europe. The Epic was born in Italy with ""Quo Vadis"" in 1913 and the advancements of the Italians influenced D.W. Griffith and others in burgeoning Hollywood.American films were loved in Italy pre 1939 and after the war as well. Each country has devoured the other's film product with gusto and learned in the process what great cinema could be. The two cultures influence and shaped each other's new art of the 20th century. Operatic, melodrama, and grand sweeping emotions are at the core a staple of both cinemas. So what does this have to do with ""Don't Tell"" you may wonder?This brilliant film is bi-national, in that it is set both in Italy and the United States. It has a sense of blending of the two cultures and there differences as well in doing so it shows an Italian point of view of America. It is a great and revealing thing to see the USA from a European perspective. This jumped off the screen for me and added a deeper layer to the filmThe story is indeed deeply moving and the film's cast does remarkable work in the telling of the story of repressed memory and what happens when it is awakened. Of particular note are Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Alessio Boni , and Luigi Lo Cassio (These two actors played the brothers in the incredible ""The Best Of Youth"" and it is a treat to see them again working together.)

995998,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B000FUF6SQ,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","""Don't Tell"" is another ""Best Foreign Language"" Oscar nominee that I took a chance on solely on it's nomination.  I wasn't sure what I was getting into but the film was doing alright setting up the characters and their relation to each other.  There were a couple of comic-relief characters who, oddly enough, worked themselves in very well in this drama of the unspeakable.  Our main character was depicted as an unflappable person who goes with the flow.  In time, however, a nightmare leaves her vulnerable and uncertain.  An interesting aspect of this film is who nearly everyone has issues with anxieties and self-esteem.The only way for our heroine to deal with her fears and clouded memories were to visit her one soul-mate in the nightmare; her brother in America.  This enables the plot to thicken and for her friends back home to develop their own subplots.  The reliving of the past was both tramatic and theraputic for the siblings and the manner in which they reluctantly revealed their memories was well done, I thought.  In fact, I kept thinking how the direstor, Cristina Comencina, was giving us the reactions rather than the actions.  It minimized the suspense and brutality but it gave us a look at the real tragedy of such abominations.

She soon learns she is pregnant by her handsome boyfriend actor and the strain from all these changes in her life propell her to talk to her brother in search of answers.It is her visit to the US that helps her bond with her brother who is otherwise unable to connect emotionally even with the members of his family.  His wife Anna is understanding and supportuve, but it seems that silent forces are causing their frequent arguments, they are unable to hide even from people and children around them.  It is at this moment that both brother and sister have to accept the pain of their childhood sexual abuse by their father.  On pretense that they are family, their mother was ignoring the abuse trying to protect their seemingly perfect family appearances.The power of sexual abouse and the mark it leaves on one's life is as traumatic for the participant and emotionally troubling for the outsider.  This film addresses the need of childhood abuse survivors to overcome their own guilt and anger and regain ability to establish normacy in their own lives and relationships.  It is a daunting task for both victims and people in their lives, but it is fight worth fighting for. The classincal beauty of the leading actress Giovanna Mezzogiorno is mesmerizing.

It seems that this is perhaps the central theme of this beautifully directed Italian drama.A woman is troubled by a dream of being molested by her father, and is afraid she has awakened a memory that she has repressed for years, so she goes to America to visit her estranged brother and his family and try to talk about the sensitive subject matter and address issues that might be troubling her.Don't Tell covers the delicate ground of child molestation and how, as adults, the victims try to deal with the painful memories. It also covers other very emotional territory, like the cheating nature of men (every man in the film at some point cheats on his lover, leaves her, talks about having done so, etc.) I don't know if that part of the story is in the original novel, or if it was added because the film was directed by a woman. Either way, it feeds the relationship doubt that women already have.Don't Tell is a very moving and superbly acted film.
