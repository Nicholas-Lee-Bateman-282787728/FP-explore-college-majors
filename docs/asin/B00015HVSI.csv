Vol. 1 has two episodes- part one tries to minimize the plot of the first book, episode two is a chapter from the second. The characters do not bear much resemblance from the novels and yukikaze has none of the draw that the books have.

793554,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B00015HVSI,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 1]","A dimensional portal was opened 33 years ago. Aliens known as The JAM came through and attacked Earth. The military was able to drive them back to their home world, where the fight continues. Lt. Fukai pilots a jet with an advanced AI on board. It is called Yukikaze. The war is at a stalemate, but the existence of Yukikaze could turn things around. It may be a blessing, or even a curse. One thing is certain. The war is about to end.This anime is very strange. I think that it's one of those that will likely create huge fans or ardent naysayers. I have mixed feelings. I think that the plot was pretty well done. It's a lot like Robotech. The major flaw with this series is the character development. A series as short as this doesn't really have much chance to develop good characters. None of the characters have any personality. They are empty and lifeless, except for Major Bukhar. The story moves very slowly, but manages to keep you relatively interested in what is going to happen next.The production quality is very good for a series from 2002. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are very well done. They obviously took care to make a quality product. It's not a bad series, it's just not my cup of tea. I like characters with lots of emotion and depth, in addition to a great story. If you feel the same as me, you should probably avoid this title.When I first started watching Yukikaze, I gave up after episode 1. It was very strange and moved very slow. After a couple of months, I stared again at episode 2. Things start to get more normal, and the series gains a little depth. Even so, the lack of character depth and drama makes it an average watch in my opinion. Like I said before, I think most will either love it or hate it. I can't recommend buying this OVA before you've seen it. I think you should watch it online before spending your money. I kind of wish that I had. I can't see myself watching it again. I'll probably sell this DVD.",3,"Great Productoin Quality, Good Story, Dull Characters",1361145600,"02 18, 2013",2013,1975,"['dimensional', 'portal', 'was', 'opened', '33', 'years', 'ago', 'Aliens', 'known', 'JAM', 'came', 'attacked', 'Earth', 'military', 'was', 'able', 'drive', 'back', 'home', 'world', 'where', 'fight', 'Lt.', 'Fukai', 'pilots', 'jet', 'advanced', 'AI', 'board', 'called', 'Yukikaze', 'war', 'stalemate', 'existence', 'Yukikaze', 'could', 'turn', 'things', 'may', 'be', 'blessing', 'even', 'curse', 'One', 'thing', 'certain', 'war', 'end.This', 'anime', 'very', 'strange', 'think', 'one', 'will', 'likely', 'create', 'huge', 'fans', 'ardent', 'naysayers', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'think', 'plot', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'done', 'lot', 'Robotech', 'major', 'flaw', 'series', 'character', 'development', 'A', 'series', 'as', 'short', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'much', 'chance', 'develop', 'good', 'characters', 'None', 'characters', 'have', 'personality', 'are', 'empty', 'lifeless', 'Major', 'Bukhar', 'story', 'very', 'slowly', 'keep', 'relatively', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'next.The', 'production', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'series', '2002', 'animation', 'voice', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'plot', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'obviously', 'took', 'care', 'make', 'quality', 'product', 'not', 'bad', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'cup', 'tea', 'characters', 'lots', 'emotion', 'depth', 'addition', 'great', 'story', 'feel', 'same', 'should', 'probably', 'avoid', 'title.When', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'Yukikaze', 'gave', 'up', 'episode', '1', 'was', 'very', 'strange', 'moved', 'very', 'slow', 'couple', 'months', 'stared', 'again', 'episode', '2', 'Things', 'start', 'get', 'more', 'normal', 'series', 'gains', 'little', 'depth', 'Even', 'so', 'lack', 'character', 'depth', 'drama', 'average', 'watch', 'opinion', 'said', 'think', 'most', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'OVA', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'think', 'should', 'watch', 'spending', 'money', 'kind', 'wish', 'had', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'watching', 'again', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'sell', 'DVD']",N/A

793559,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00015HVSI,Sesho,"[5, 6]","33 years ago a dimensional portal opened in Antarctica, and what came through the door was not friendly. An alien race known as the JAM began attacking the Earth. A UN force was formed from the nations of the world and successfully pushed the aliens back to their homeworld, dubbed ""Fairy"", by the humans. Since all of the battles occur there, the JAM have become almost a fairy tale to normal people. But not to the Special Air Force (SAF), a military unit equipped with almost sentient jets, who launch daily sorties into Fairy. Rei Fukai pilots Yukikaze, one of these intelligent jets, and to the concern of his best friend, Bukhar, seems to relate more to the machine than to humans. With suspicions of JAM infiltration into the Earth forces, and with doppelganger planes confusing the SAF, its getting hard to know who to trust. There is also a push to make all jets unmanned, controlled fully by computers, with all the attendant dangers that go with it.The animation in these two episodes is some of the best I have seen, seamlessly integrating traditional and cgi techniques. It makes Top Gun look bad. It's a little hard to figure out what is going on at first so it beckons for a second viewing. I thought the male characters were just a tad too effeminate, but that's a minor complaint.Also features a making of documentary and interviews with the Japanese cast and crew.
