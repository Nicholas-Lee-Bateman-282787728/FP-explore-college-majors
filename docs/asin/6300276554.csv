And I'll have to agree with former reviewers who have been not only annoyed that Disney has not released Song of the South, but saddened at the politically correct agenda they seem to be following.I've seen Song of the South quite a number of times.  My father-in-law bought it through a third party, and had to get the film to be fixed so he could watch it on VHS.  It's a great film, and not only that, this Sing Along video highlights many of the songs and stories from that movie.A wonderful Sing Along video to add to anyone's collection.  And a shame that it can't be bought at any Disney store any longer.  I wonder what Walt would think or do?

240567,A19RAJY6R7USN0,6300276554,"Lee Neville ""emotionboy""","[18, 19]","This may be volume two of the Disney Sing Alongs collection in the US, but it was the first one released in the UK where I bought it. It was a Christmas present and I was so excited to get it. In truth, I wanted it to see the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo sequence from Cinderella and wasn't bothered about Zip A Dee Doo Dah, but I enjoyed that too. This video also featured rarer songs such as Mickey Mouse Club March, It's A Small World and The Ballad Of Davy Crockett. Other songs included were Following The Leader from Peter Pan (released several times on different sing along songs videos), The Unbirthday Song from Alice In Wonderland, Casy Junior from Dumbo and Whistle While You Work from Snow White.The real highlight though was Zip A Dee Doo Dah and the unadvertised Song Of The South from SONG OF THE SOUTH. And here's my sidenote: Now in America, there seems to be some issues regarding the release of the film Song Of The South because of its slavery connotations. In fact, the movie is set after the slavery period. However Michael Eisner as head of The Walt Disney Company has chosen not to release it in case it could fuel racial hatred. Obviously for fans of Song Of The South, that seems ridiculous, but what fans don't know is that Disney have received protests from some celebrities who say they will seriously make some noise if Song Of The South is ever released. By the way, Song Of The South was available on video in the UK years ago- no riots! (And if you really wanna get a copy pirate versions are available in New York) There is a light at the end of the tunnel though- there is a rumor that Disney will release Song Of The South in 2005 or 2006- fingers crossed. They should just get Leonard Maltin to do an introduction about Song Of The South in its historical context. You know what, I think everyone should get over themselves. Song Of The South is a family film after all.Back to the review. This is one of the more special sing along videos since it really set the bar. Just ignore the Song Of The South argument.

They're obviously afraid to re release this classic because they're afraid people will be offended by the racial ""steriotype"" of Uncle Reemus. First of all, by keeping the whole movie under lock n key a briliant African American actor, James Baskit, remains forgotten. Second, if you watch the WHOLE movie (last  reissued in 1986) you'll see Uncle Reemus is smatter than ALL the white people in the story! If you check Ebay you'll see a LOT of bootleg DVDs of the COMPLETE version. This is hurting Disney in their wallets. Guess Disney would rather eat several million $$$ than be accused of being ""insensitive"".I should also point out that Uncle Reemus is NOT a slave! This movie takes place AFTER the Civil War! (The fact that Reemus is allowed to leave the Plantation to fetch Bobby Driscol's father is proof of this.)

When you compare the great classic SONG OF THE SOUTH to the violence going on in movies, the sex, the vulgarity, the garbage that movie patrons see every year, something is terribly wrong. When Disney thinks they are being politically correct by disowning SONG OF THE SOUTH, remember they were also the studio that brought out PRIEST (about a gay priest), ALADDIN (portraying Arabs as stereotypes), and violent movies like THE PROGRAM, RANSOM, THE ROCK, CON AIR, etc. And what of GONE WITH THE WIND and it's non-brutal treatment of negroes (Scarlett was about the only Southerner who had a problem, and that was only with Mammy and Prissy). And what of BIRTH OF A NATION? The ultimate racist classic of all time. But it is considered a classic, and studied in all film classes (I studied it when I was attending class). Let's face it. When we see the Ku Klux Klan trying to rescue an all-white town from these ape-like (they acted like apes) negroes, and the audience is supposed to cheer, somehow, especially in today's modern age, something is lost in the translation. But neither BIRTH OF A NATION or GONE WITH THE WIND are banned. They've tried to ban 'Huckleberry Finn' from schools, but have always failed (for good reason). Mark Twain's book is no worse than the tales of Uncle Remus in SONG OF THE SOUTH, and just as fun. I suppose with any great movie or great book, we can always disect it, and discover something negative about it. But with SONG OF THE SOUTH there is very little to find fault with. Perhaps the film is a little too cheery. Maybe there isn't enough brutality in it (like GONE WITH THE WIND or the infamous BIRTH OF A NATION). Maybe Disney should re-edit the film and make certain that there are a few moments where Uncle Remus is whipped by his masters, or maybe we can see more prejudice amongst the townspeople. Maybe B'rer Rabbit or B'rer Fox can offer some disparaging remarks towards Negroes. Then maybe, just maybe, Disney should ban the film. But the film stands on its own. SONG OF THE SOUTH stands tall.
