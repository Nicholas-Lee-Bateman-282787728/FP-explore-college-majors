1230132,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B001PYD0P2,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[1, 2]","Sai, Royce, Kerra and Eric are four pretty people living together in a loft in LA (and by pretty I mean they're not that pretty, but I'm guessing they were supposed to be). Sai is an artist, while Royce is her unofficial photographer. Eric is the carefree one who gets his share of the rent wherever he can, while Kerra . . . I don't know, her character was never really developed. Anyway, as 2009's BLED opens, everyone is attending a gallery showing of Sai's latest collection. A mysterious stranger, Renfield, shows interest in a piece and Sai invites him back to the loft to see her newest newest paintings. It's there where Renfield tells Sai about this crazy new drug he's got. It's the bark from a very rare tree, and it's covered in little red pustules that, when cooked, emit a smoke that, once inhaled, takes the user on a wild ride.He invites Sai to try it and because Renfield has told her this drug will open her mind, she says why not. What the drug actually does is transports Sai's mind to a creepy enchanted forest in a dream reality where she is stalked by an incubus who looks just like Royce--the true object of Sai's affections.The next day, Renfield is gone, but he's left his twig behind, and when Sai tells the others about it, she explains artists and writers use absinthe to spur their creativity, and this drug is like a super form of that. This was the educational part of the movie because I had no idea I'd been doing it wrong all these years. Silly me, I've been trying to write using my ACTUAL imagination and, hopefully, talent. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.Anyway, she offers some to the gang, but only Eric, the carefree one, is eager to try it. He likes what he sees and ends up stealing a bit of the twig from Sai. Meanwhile Sai tells Royce how she feels about him and Royce, the dense one of the group who sees what's going on, knows something's not right with Kerra or with Sai, but turns a blind eye, confesses his love for her, too.The truth of the matter is, the more of the drug Sai takes, the more trips to the creepy enchanted forest and the more encounters with the incubus that lives there, the further Sai slips into that reality, becoming a succubus herself.In the end, Renfield shows back up to reveal his master plan. Draw the incubus into the real world so he can steal its blood and extend his own mortal life. And all it costs is the lives of the four not really that pretty people from the loft.Will love win out and keep Royce and Sai together? Will Royce ever open Kerra's bedroom door and discover she's been lying dead in there for the past few days? Will Eric finally get his act together and get a job? Will I ever in my entire life, even if I lived to be 100, have cause to watch this movie again?That last answer is a hell no.BLED is written by Sxv'leithan Essex (hey, I'm just reporting it as it is in the credits) and directed by Christopher Hutson, who had an uncredited role in the X-FILES pilot as well as one in DIAGNOSIS MURDER before going on to write and direct such classics as DARK REALITY and BUTCHER HOUSE, and if BLED is any indication of the kind of pace and bad editing that comes from either of these two, I think I'm good as far as seeing any more of the movies they've worked on.At only 95 minutes, BLED felt more like 150. Every scene just dragged on and on, as if the actors had all taken huge doses of Robitussin just before shooting. And then the film was slowed down after being coated in honey and syrup. I got so bored I ended up playing two or three games of pool on my phone, and I didn't miss one detail.Essex's script isn't bad, but the smarminess of the actors coupled with the viewer having to pretty much guess at what's going on stifle what little enjoyment this movie may have offered. And the third act just dissolves into a mess of incomprehensibility the likes of which I've seldom seen before. I don't know where the writer and director were during the screening of their movie, but obviously they think it makes a lot more sense than it does. In fact, what little I was able to discern of the plot I got from reading the back of the DVD case and the IMDB synopsis. And I read those before I saw the movie, so I can only imagine how little sense it would have made had I gone into it cold.The movie is set in two primary locations, the loft apartment and the creepy enchanted forest, and both sets were constructions, and obviously so. The forest scene is shot so as to disguise just how small the space really is, and the loft is shot in bedrooms only, no common area is ever established--in fact we really only see Kerra's, Sai's and Eric's bedrooms. For all I know Royce sleeps on the couch or in the tub or on the floor. Maybe Royce never sleeps. Don't know. Don't care. I'm just glad it's over. The problem is, this lack of establishment makes the characters feel less like real people and more like characters in a badly-constructed movie. Which is exactly what they are, granted, but still...BLED was one long, boring nightmarish mess of a movie. I'm sure the intentions were good, but the execution was just sloppy and embarrassing. This isn't even a movie I'd recommend on cheese merits alone, it's just bad.",1,Bled,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",2012,5233,"['Sai', 'Royce', 'Kerra', 'Eric', 'are', 'four', 'pretty', 'people', 'living',

1230141,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001PYD0P2,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 5]","Bled (Christopher Hutson, 2009)Somewhere inside Bled, the new movie from Charlie Hutson (Dark Reality), is a really interesting movie straining to get out. The linked subjects of vampires and addiction are inherently interesting, especially in our current addiction-obsessed climate; I've seen the parallel touched on in a few movies, but I've never seen a full-length treatment of it. While there's no denying this is one, it is anything but interesting.Sai (The Mirror's Sarah Farooqui) is an artists who's on her way up. She meets the mysterious Renfield (Ghost Rider's Jonathan Oldham) at a gallery opening, and he turns her onto a mysterious new drug that (he claims) is harvested from the bark of a tree in Eastern Europe. Okay, except that it looks a whole heck of a lot like blood. When Sai inhales the smoke that rises when you cook the stuff up in a spoon (can you see the incredible subtlety here?), she finds herself transported into a dream-world which gives her all sorts of artistic inspiration, not to mention erotic fantasies about her friend Royce (Sunday Evening's Chris Ivan Cevic). As time goes on, naturally, she needs more and more of the drug to be transported, and things get worse when her pal Eric (Shadows' Alex Petrovich) swipes her stash after his first taste of the stuff.I don't think mentioning vampires in any film where one of the characters is named Renfield is all that much of a spoiler, even when the word ""vampire"" never actually pops up in the movie. But the whole vampire thing is a subplot here, actually (another take on the subject matter that could have made this a far more interesting movie than it actually is); instead, the main focus of the movie is on addiction. Where that, too, could have been done very well, the film is instead satisfied to stop off at all the usual clich&eacute;s rather than trying to do anything interesting, original, or nuanced with the subject matter. The acting is in general substandard, though Cevic seems an especially likable chap, and may have himself a future in the acting world. Unfortunately, his relatively good performance is stuck inside a script that seems as if it's actively fighting against going anywhere. You're probably better off forgetting this thing even exists. *",1,Horrible.,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,2266,"['Bled', 'Christopher', 'Hutson', '2009', 'Somewhere', 'inside', 'Bled', 'new', 'movie', 'Charlie', 'Hutson', 'Dark', 'Reality', 'really', 'interesting', 'movie', 'straining', 'get', 'out', 'linked', 'subjects', 'vampires', 'addiction', 'are', 'inherently', 'interesting', 'especially', 'current', 'addiction-obsessed', 'climate', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'parallel', 'touched', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'full-length', 'treatment', 'denying', 'one', 'anything', 'interesting.Sai', 'Mirror', 'Sarah', 'Farooqui', 'artists', 'who', 'way', 'up', 'mysterious', 'Renfield', 'Ghost', 'Rider', 'Jonathan', 'Oldham', 'gallery', 'opening', 'mysterious', 'new', 'drug', 'harvested', 'bark', 'tree', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Okay', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'blood', 'When', 'Sai', 'smoke', 'when', 'cook', 'stuff', 'up', 'spoon', 'can', 'see', 'incredible', 'subtlety', 'here', 'transported', 'dream-world', 'sorts', 'artistic', 'inspiration', 'not', 'mention', 'erotic', 'fantasies', 'friend', 'Royce', 'Sunday', 'Evening', 'Chris', 'Ivan', 'Cevic', 'time', 'naturally', 'more', 'more', 'drug', 'be', 'transported', 'things', 'get', 'worse', 'when', 'pal', 'Eric', 'Shadows', 'Alex', 'Petrovich', 'stash', 'first', 'taste', 'stuff.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mentioning', 'vampires', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'characters', 'named', 'Renfield', 'much', 'spoiler', 'even', 'when', 'word', 'vampire', 'never', 'actually', 'up', 'movie', 'whole', 'vampire', 'thing', 'subplot', 'here', 'actually', 'take', 'subject', 'matter', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie', 'actually', 'instead', 'main', 'focus', 'movie', 'addiction', 'Where', 'too', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'instead', 'satisfied', 'stop', 'off', 'usual', 'clich', 'eacute', 'rather', 'trying', 'do', 'anything', 'interesting', 'original', 'nuanced', 'subject', 'matter', 'acting', 'general', 'substandard', 'Cevic', 'especially', 'likable', 'chap', 'may', 'have', 'future', 'acting', 'world', 'Unfortunately', 'relatively', 'good', 'performance', 'stuck', 'script', 'actively', 'fighting', 'going', 'anywhere', ""'re"", 'probably', 'better', 'off', 'forgetting', 'thing', 'even', '*']",N/A
