897197,A3D09XGX4FOLSB,B00080XWUC,KinoChelovek,"[0, 0]","I bought the Asian import of the movie, so many of the extras on this version are probably not on my copy.  One difference is that the subtitles are not well-written on the import.To the movie...I am not into anime.  Yes, I watched early stuff from Japan, like ""Speed Racer"" and ""Space Battleship Yamato,"" but not 90s and 2000s animation.  I do like some of the features, like ""Steamboy"" and ""Akira,"" but that is as far as it goes for me.  I bought ""Cutie Honey"" because I've been into sword-wielding Asian women for a few years now.  I like to see these women kick some bad-guy-butt!  I'm not a die-hard anime fan.""Cutie Honey"" was another movie I really was not expecting to be great.  I decided (perhaps prematurely at the time) to let my daughter watch, along with my wife and myself.  We were laughing quite a bit at the over-the-top acting by the ""baddies"" and the computer animation.  There is some really great computer effects in the movie!  The dialogue is quite witty, too.  I have to say that for myself, and not knowing anything about the animated series (until after the movie), I was not too lost with the storyline.  I guess it would help to know a little more about the characters, though, through watching the animated stuff.I, particularly, liked the ""Odd Couple"" chemistry between Cutie and Natsuko.  Truly great stuff, and attractive actresses to boot.  The humor from and between the ""Claws"" and Sister Jill was also very good.  I thought the use of color in many of the scenes were top-notch.  A problem I found is that Cutie was obviously NOT played by Eriko Sato in many of the ""rear shots.""  The front shots obviously look to have been done with green screen effects.  However, who would have a well-known model running around Japan while filming?  The movie would never be finished.It was just a very well done work of taking an animated character and putting it into live action.4.25 of 5 for entertainment value.  It wouldn't hurt to read about the characters beforehand.  I was a bit lost over the ""no clothes"" concept until I learned who Cutie was, for example.  Quite a bit of comic book violence, and can creep little children out, especially a couple of the ""Claw"" characters.",4,"Really Enjoyable, Surprisingly So!",1355097600,"12 10, 2012",2012,2210,"['bought', 'Asian', 'import', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'extras', 'version', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'copy', 'One', 'difference', 'subtitles', 'are', 'not', 'well-written', 'import.To', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'anime', 'Yes', 'watched', 'early', 'stuff', 'Japan', 'Speed', 'Racer', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'not', '90s', '2000s', 'animation', 'do', 'features', 'Steamboy', 'Akira', 'as', 'far', 'bought', 'Cutie', 'Honey', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sword-wielding', 'Asian', 'women', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'like', 'see', 'women', 'kick', 'bad-guy-butt', ""'m"", 'not', 'die-hard', 'anime', 'fan', 'Cutie', 'Honey', 'was', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'great', 'decided', 'perhaps', 'prematurely', 'time', 'let', 'daughter', 'watch', 'wife', 'were', 'laughing', 'quite', 'bit', 'over-the-top', 'acting', 'baddies', 'computer', 'animation', 'really', 'great', 'computer', 'effects', 'movie', 'dialogue', 'quite', 'witty', 'too', 'have', 'say', 'myself', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'animated', 'series', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'lost', 'storyline', 'guess', 'would', 'help', 'know', 'little', 'more', 'characters', 'though', 'watching', 'animated', 'stuff.I', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'chemistry', 'Cutie', 'Natsuko', 'Truly', 'great', 'stuff', 'attractive', 'actresses', 'boot', 'humor', 'Claws', 'Sister', 'Jill', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'thought', 'use', 'color', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'top-notch', 'problem', 'found', 'Cutie', 'was', 'obviously', 'NOT', 'played', 'Eriko', 'Sato', 'many', 'rear', 'shots', 'front', 'shots', 'obviously', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'green', 'screen', 'effects', 'However', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'well-known', 'model', 'running', 'around', 'Japan', 'filming', 'movie', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'finished.It', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'work', 'taking', 'animated', 'character', 'putting', 'live', 'action.4.25', '5', 'entertainment', 'value', 'would', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'read', 'characters', 'beforehand', 'was', 'bit', 'lost', 'clothes', 'concept', 'learned', 'who', 'Cutie', 'was', 'example', 'bit', 'comic', 'book', 'violence', 'can', 'creep', 'little', 'children', 'out', 'especially', 'couple', 'Claw', 'characters']",Cutie Honey

As long as she has the energy to do so - so we see her eating a lot of rice balls.  Second, I am sure they changed the Cutie Honey opening lyrics, but that's OK, because they wanted to make sure it was for ages 13 and up.  Third, Eriko Sato is a great Cutie Honey.  Always happy, shapely and willing to wear that weird, if sexy, outfit.  Fourth, Carrie Keranen is the English voice actress for Cutie Honey and does a great job at matching the Japanese Idol's energy and expressions.The story is simple.  Cutie Honey must save the world from the evil organization called the Panther Claw.  They are EVIL, because they have kidnapped girls, stolen gold and been pretty mean towards everybody.  There is a lot of fighting styled after anime and manga scenes, lots of outfits for Cutie Honey and lots of humor.  Even better is the Making of Cutie Honey feature that is one of the best extras I have seen on a DVD.  The whole movie is 93 minutes long, is fast and rarely bores you.

The main character seems to be a mix of Sailor moon and power rangers storyline intermixed with the usual over the top villains and allies to help or hinder the heroine throughout the movie.  The movie can be for most people of all ages and while there is showing of the character in her underwear there isn't any true nudity or offensiveness in the movie for parents to really worry about.  The acting is also a mix of over the top to natural with the usual boasting overconfident villains and friends that make the scenes truly enjoying to watch.  The video is decent and sharp with no true blurriness or distortions to worry about and the audio is very well down as well.

Thats just awesome, though why on earth she doesn't have any regular clothes is just beyond me, she has to get full of food for access energy to generate her own wardrobe, I am not asking for realizm, but why have a bra and panties at all then if she lacks clothes at all? Other reviewers have referred to it as going pink, being cute, sexy, but never quite nekkid, I get it, mind you, but still.Something about the copy I got of it though...No commercials is just fine with me, but the prodiction value of the disk itself is a bit shakey, there are times when the movie starts to fragment out and/or freeze up on me. If I had some better units to play it on, I am sure it would be far less of a problem, but I am saying that the problem does exist.The only other thing I noticed about my copy is that the cover art is different from what is depicted, I ordered the non-special edition, which shows Cutie Honey standing, full body frame with a heart in the background, however the copy I received is the cover art shown in the special edition-sorry, limited edition. I am guessing then that the only real difference is that the limited edition has a varient box art, key chain and some manner of metal tin case, lunch box looking number.So, really, if I had my way to do it all over again, I would probably shell out the extra-within reason, to get the limited edition just for the extras, still a good movie though ^_^Thank you...",5,Loved the opening sequence...,1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,1662,"['Greetings', 'Seeing', 'Eriko', 'Sato', 'running', 'down', 'busy', 'street', 'underwear', 'garbage', 'bag', 'dress', 'everyone', 'face', 'camera', 'falling', 'over', 'running', 'one', 'tripping', 'over', 'catch', 'eyefull', 'Thats', 'just', 'awesome', 'though', 'why', 'earth', ""n't"", 'have', 'regular', 'clothes', 'just', 'get', 'full', 'food', 'access', 'energy', 'generate', 'own', 'wardrobe', 'am', 'not', 'asking', 'realizm', 'why', 'have', 'bra', 'panties', 'then', 'clothes', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'referred', 'going', 'pink', 'being', 'cute', 'sexy', 'never', 'quite', 'nekkid', 'get', 'mind', 'still.Something', 'copy', 'got', 'commercials', 'just', 'fine', 'prodiction', 'value', 'disk', 'bit', 'shakey', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'movie', 'fragment', 'out', 'and/or', 'freeze', 'up', 'had', 'better', 'units', 'play', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'problem', 'am', 'saying', 'problem', 'exist.The', 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'noticed', 'copy', 'cover', 'art', 'different', 'what', 'depicted', 'ordered', 'non-special', 'edition', 'Cutie', 'Honey', 'standing', 'full', 'body', 'frame', 'heart', 'background', 'however', 'copy', 'received', 'cover', 'art', 'shown', 'special', 'edition-sorry', 'limited', 'edition', 'am', 'guessing', 'then', 'only', 'real', 'difference', 'limited', 'edition', 'varient', 'box', 'art', 'key', 'chain', 'manner', 'metal', 'tin', 'case', 'lunch', 'box', 'looking', 'number.So', 'really', 'had', 'way', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'would', 'probably', 'shell', 'out', 'extra-within', 'reason', 'get', 'limited', 'edition', 'just', 'extras', 'still', 'good', 'movie', '^_^Thank']",Cutie Honey

But when it comes to giving a gift based on their favorite hobby, that's what hard to figure out the most.Cutie Honey (Limited Edition) set is a great idea for fans of either the anime or manga series. The movie is actually not bad, and is toned down from it's anime counter-part. (Not as much nudity, just suggestiveness) The movie itself is actually pretty good compared to other anime to live-action movies that's out there. The quality of the movie is very good as this was more than just a fan made movie. As for the story, I will not give the plot away, you are just going to have to see the movie yourself.The set comes to you as a tin lunch-box. Inside you get the DVD movie and a &#34;Cutie Honey&#34; key chain. The extras are protected by a sponge material that is coated inside the tin lunch-box. All together an interesting gift idea for the &#34;Cutie Honey&#34; fan.Normally you would expect some kind of &#34;adult&#34; material to appear in this movie, as that was the case with the anime, but that is NOT the case. The movie itself is very clean, even a child can watch it. Language is moderate (No swearing of any kind) and the violence was not that bad. Action sequences are equal only to the &#34;Power Rangers&#34; battle scenes. A very comical movie for the whole family to watch. My only recommendation is that you see the anime series, as the movie doesn't totally explain a lot of her past. Ideally, for fans of the series, but also for anyone who likes a &#34;cute&#34; action movie.",4,"An interesting gift idea for the ""Anime"" fans...",1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1626,"['kinds', 'gifts', 'are', 'good', 'when', 'have', 'birthday', 'other', 'gifts', 'good', 'when', 'celebrate', 'something', 'when', 'giving', 'gift', 'based', 'favorite', 'hobby', 'what', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'most.Cutie', 'Honey', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'set', 'great', 'idea', 'fans', 'anime', 'manga', 'series', 'movie', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'toned', 'down', 'anime', 'counter-part', 'Not', 'as', 'much', 'nudity', 'just', 'suggestiveness', 'movie', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'compared', 'other', 'anime', 'live-action', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'quality', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'more', 'just', 'fan', 'made', 'movie', 'story', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'are', 'just', 'going', 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'yourself.The', 'set', 'tin', 'lunch-box', 'get', 'DVD', 'movie', '34', 'Cutie', 'Honey', '34', 'key', 'chain', 'extras', 'are', 'protected', 'sponge', 'material', 'coated', 'tin', 'lunch-box', 'together', 'interesting', 'gift', 'idea', '34', 'Cutie', 'Honey', '34', 'fan.Normally', 'would', 'expect', 'kind', '34', 'adult', '34', 'material', 'appear', 'movie', 'was', 'case', 'anime', 'NOT', 'case', 'movie', 'very', 'clean', 'even', 'child', 'can', 'watch', 'Language', 'moderate', 'swearing', 'kind', 'violence', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'Action', 'sequences', 'are', 'equal', 'only', '34', 'Power', 'Rangers', '34', 'battle', 'scenes', 'very', 'comical', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'watch', 'only', 'recommendation', 'see', 'anime', 'series', 'movie', ""n't"", 'totally', 'explain', 'lot', 'past', 'Ideally', 'fans', 'series', 'also', 'anyone', 'who', '34', 'cute', '34', 'action', 'movie']",Cutie Honey
897205,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B00080XWUC,Zack Davisson,"[47, 49]","Cutie Honey does not get naked.  That might not seem very relevant, but if you are familiar at all with the original Go Nagai ""Cutie Honey"" series, then you know that Cutie Honey is all about getting naked, and with gravia idol Eriko Sato playing the title role, a woman who has shown time and time again that she has no problem getting naked, it is even more surprising.  During her famous ""Honey Flash"" sequence, it shifts to a CG animated figure, and even that doesn't get naked.  Now, with that out of the way, we can talk about the movie.This is definitely not going to be a film for everyone, but it is a lot of fun.  ""Cutie Honey"" really is just a big cartoon, featuring live people. There is no attempt whatsoever to make it modern or gutsy.  Director Hideaki Anno, best know for his phenomenal anime series ""Neon Genisis Evangelion"", has decided to through all of his angst out the window and go straight for the pinkest vision of cuteness that he can possibly muster.Eriko Sato works her way through an impossible number of cute costumes, or just runs around in her underwear, all the while being light and naively unaware of her own attributes. Her Cutie Honey suit isn't the famous original, but it is even more pink and works well.  The villains are over the top, at about the same level as a Sentai Power Rangers show.  The acting is just good enough to make sure everyone is having a good time, and the fight scenes are a blast.  Both remind me a lot of Kabuki theater, where everything is completely exaggerated beyond any believability, and that works in the context. Sure, there is some plot stitched here and there, to give the whole thing a a start and a finish, but it isn't really all that important.  Superstar Koda Kumi powers her way through the catchy Cutie Honey theme song, and I dare you not to catch yourself humming along even if you can't understand the Japanese.If all this sounds like a blast to you, then you are going to love ""Cutie Honey"". Shut off your brain and allow the pink to wash over you.  However, if you demand even the slightest bit of sense out of a film, then you are probably going to hate it.
