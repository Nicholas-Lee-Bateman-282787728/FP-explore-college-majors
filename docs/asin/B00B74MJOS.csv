1622669,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B00B74MJOS,Ace Reader,"[11, 17]","""The Impossible"" is an excellent film about one family's struggle to survive during a tsunami cataclysm that rocked our planet not so long ago. This excellent film sucked me into it's believably realistic and powerful story-line, holding me in my seat until it's satisfying end.FACT: On Sunday, December 26, 2004 at 00:58:53 UTC in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Sumatra, a sudden megathrust subduction (Earth is the only Planet where subduction is known to occur), undersea earthquake (magnitude 9.1-9.3) released century's of built up energy into the sea floor. This caused a rupture more then 600 miles long, displacing the seafloor above the rupture moving trillions of tons of rock that caused our entire planet to vibrate (shudder) as much as 1 centimeter (0.4 inches), and triggering other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. This displacement then sent enormous seawave swells across the Indian Ocean in every direction to surge onto land (up to 98 feet high), flooding and destroying everything in it's path. Anyone who survived this unexpected attack by mother nature was truly blessed.Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has created a masterpiece depicting the plight of a vacationing family of five (two parents and three adolescent boys), caught in one of our recent history's most harrowing catastrophes. This 2012 English-language Spanish disaster drama film is based on the true story (by Maria Belon and the screenplay is penned by Sergio G. Sanchez), of this family who were at the time of this disaster living in Japan and vacationing in Thailand at the time of the tsunami. This film was produced at ""Ciudad de la Luz"" Studios (City of Light Studios) in Spain. The terrifying tsunami sequence in this film makes you think and believe you are watching actual documentary footage of the real natural disaster that struck Asia that day killing hundreds of thousands. It's not. Director Boyona and his visual-and special effects supervisors worked on and planned for more than a year on exacting planning/experimentation for the flood scenes. They used a giant water tank in Spain (the largest in Europe) and a sprawling miniature of a beach resort. Then they added location shots in Thailand and some computer wizardry to create 10 minutes of cinematic terror for it's characters and us. The devastation is very realistic looking. Set Designer, Pilar Revuelta has done a brilliant job creating huge areas of devastation that the actors acted in the middle of.Naomi Watts (British/Australian actress known for her role as Ann Darrow-(Beauty) in Peter Jackson's 2005 ""King Kong""), preforms the lead character role ""Maria"" who is the mother of three young boy's and wife to husband ""Henry"" preformed by Ewan McGregor (Scottish actor known for his role as Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln, in Michael Mann's 2005 ""The Island""). Her acting is superb. She deserves her Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and I hope she wins. Naomi Watts spent two weeks in a water tank shooting grueling underwater scenes for this film. She convinced me that what she was going through on screen was totally real. I thought Naomi was going to die! I could almost feel her pain as I watched her character struggle to survive throughout this emotional film. Her performance as the determined, strong and resilient mother, fighting for her own life and that of her son ""Lucas"" (preformed by Tom Holland) from death by the huge tidal surge that threatens both of their lives...was amazing. Young actor Tom Holland did an excellent job carrying many scenes in this film.Maria's husband Ewan McGregor's ""Henry"", does an excellent character performance depicting his soul wrenching shock, despair, and feelings of hopelessness while struggling to survive in the aftermath of the tsunami. Henry has a cell phone scene that depicts the darker side of human nature that sometimes does occur during this type of stressful event. Two cute little boy actors (Oaklee Pendergast-""Simon"", and Samuel Joslin-""Thomas""), were adorable and added a much needed levity to this tragic story line. I also enjoyed seeing Geraldine Page (British-American actress known for her role as Tonya in director David Lean's 1965 ""Doctor Zhivago), as the old woman who gives Lucas a soulful talk about the life and death of stars in the nights sky. This films original score is by Fernando Velazquez and the wonderful Cinematography is expertly handled by Oscar Faura.I hate to use the words ""entertaining"" and ""enjoyable"" for this film, but they do apply. ""The Impossible"" is very good and very well done. I highly recommend this historically based film. Enjoy!Release Date: 4 January 2013Running Time: 114 minutesRated: PG-13 for intense realistic sequences, including disturbing injury images and brief nudity.Disaster Drama/ThrillerGrade: AHistorical side note: In 2004 at the time of this tsunami, only the Pacific Ocean had a tsunami warning system. This system of floating buoys called DART, was established in 1949 following the 1946 Aleutian Island Earthquake and the tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties in Hawaii and Alaska. Because of this event, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was added to the Pacific Ocean Warning System extending it's coverage. It became active in late June 2006 consisting of 25 seismographic stations relaying information to 26 national Tsunami information centers, as well as three deep-ocean sensors.On March 11, 2011 at 14:46:23 UTC, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan another undersea megathrust subduction (magnitude 9.0) earthquake fractured the sea floor suddenly generating monster seawave swells that inundated Japans sea-level coastline. The Pacific Ocean Warning System did do it's job and is believed to have saved many lives, but this time the epicenter (70 kilometers (43 mi) off shore), was too close to land to be fully effective. Massive wave surges came flooding inland too fast to save everyone. Wave heights were up to 40.5 meters (133 feet) traveling inland 10km (6 miles) destroying everything in it's path. Chillingly this earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4m (8 feet) east and shifted the earth on it's axis by estimates of between 10cm (4 inches) and 25cm (10 inches).The final death toll for the Indian Ocean Tsunami was a staggering 283,000. The death toll for 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami was much less at 15,878, but had thousands injured or missing. When this type of event happens again, hopefully this ocean seismic warning system will again benefit the people in the target area and save lives.",5,Impossible not to be swept away by this dramatic

Anyone watching the film an always guess the ending but this film is not about the destination, it is about the road that the family must have to travel to survive the ordeal and regroup.Henry ( Mcgreogor) and Maria( naomi Watts) are vacationing in Thailand. This is a family who is at play but has worries just like everyone about layoffs at work and back to work transition for the wife, she is a doctor. This is a normal family who are about to suffer under extraordinary circumstances...The Tsunami sequence is just amazing, the devastation by the force of the water is incredible, the sight of bodies being tossed around and getting hit by objects - just watch it to experience it.After the amazing Tsunami sequence the pace does slow down a little bit but the human element comes to the forefront as the family having separated must find each other in the chaos that ensued. Mcgregor and Watts are super actors but it is their screen son Lucas who is the star as he metamorphoses from a boy to a man. He gives an outstanding performance. This is a decent movie that does seem to e a bit stretched when towards the end, the director delves in to melodrama a la bollywood when characters are literally one step away from each other but dont notce. This is a small mistake though for a extremely well made and moving film, four stars. 9/10/2013",4,A family and its heroism,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1463,"['Impossible', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Alvarez', 'Belon', 'family', 'caught', '2004', 'tsunami', 'ravaged', 'Asia', 'Anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'always', 'guess', 'ending', 'film', 'not', 'destination', 'road', 'family', 'must', 'have', 'travel', 'survive', 'ordeal', 'regroup.Henry', 'Mcgreogor', 'Maria', 'naomi', 'Watts', 'are', 'vacationing', 'Thailand', 'family', 'who', 'play', 'worries', 'just', 'everyone', 'layoffs', 'work', 'back', 'work', 'transition', 'wife', 'doctor', 'normal', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'suffer', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'Tsunami', 'sequence', 'just', 'amazing', 'devastation', 'force', 'water', 'incredible', 'sight', 'bodies', 'being', 'tossed', 'getting', 'hit', 'objects', 'just', 'watch', 'experience', 'it.After', 'amazing', 'Tsunami', 'sequence', 'pace', 'slow', 'down', 'little', 'bit', 'human', 'element', 'forefront', 'family', 'having', 'separated', 'must', 'find', 'other', 'chaos', 'ensued', 'Mcgregor', 'Watts', 'are', 'super', 'actors', 'screen', 'son', 'Lucas', 'who', 'star', 'boy', 'man', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'decent', 'movie', 'seem', 'e', 'bit', 'stretched', 'when', 'towards', 'end', 'director', 'melodrama', 'la', 'bollywood', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'literally', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'other', 'dont', 'notce', 'small', 'mistake', 'extremely', 'well', 'made', 'moving', 'film', 'four', 'stars', '9/10/2013']",Impossible

1622685,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00B74MJOS,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Last night my wife and I snuggled up on the couch to finally watch `The Impossible' and wound up both shedding quite a few tears.  At least I wasn't the only one crying this time.  Yes, `The Impossible' is a film designed to yank every one of your heartstrings and evoke a complete outpouring of emotions, and for that it is entirely successful.  In fact, of all the films I've seen in 2012, it is the one that most effectively tapped into my tear ducts.`The Impossible' is one of those films that I'm really shocked was not all over Oscar's ballots last year.  It is tailor made for Oscar and yet only managed a singular nomination for its star, Naomi Watts.  It really deserved more than that.  No, it isn't the best film of 2012, but it is a stunning example of a director taking hold of a true story and making it as impactful as possible.Not a dry eye.The film tells the true story of a family vacationing in Thailand in 2004 when it was hit by a tsunami.  I'm sure we all remember the news coverage of the devastating event.  In fact, I can still see the images in my head of the videos that circulated the internet all those many years ago.  Telling the story of Maria Belon and her family who were separated during the tsunami and who eventually reunited despite varying degrees of distress and agony, `The Impossible' is a heartbreaking and impeccable crafted film that certainly lifts the spirits as much as it crushes them.  From nearly every angle, this film is expertly crafted and served as one of the highlights of my year.The performances are all uniformly exceptional.  Watts, who received an Oscar nomination for her performance, is unforgettable.  The internet kind of beats down on this nomination because Watts lays down a lot.  Yes, she cries and screams and moans and lays there, but she does so remarkably well.  I never once doubted her pain and struggle, both physically and emotionally.  She nailed every ounce of passion and determination, and her smaller more tender scenes are so beautifully toned.  I mean, how can you not wretch with internal pain when she whispers ""take care of my babies""?  But she wasn't the only performance worth noting.  The entire cast was spot on, from Ewan McGregor's soulful take on Henry's tireless resolve to find his family to young Tom Holland's fantastic portrayal of a young man trying to keep his mother's spirit alive despite her waning health.  Holland in particular carries this film to new heights.  He anchors the more schmaltzy scenes and manages to breathe naturalness into them.  He takes away that feeling of manipulation despite the fact that it is a very heavily manipulative film.This is honestly one of the most beautifully shot films of 2012, certainly more impressive than the digitally captured Oscar winner.  The way that each detail is perfectly captured in the right light, it's a marvelous thing to watch.  The underwater moments are devastatingly grimy, and the sun soaked atmosphere surrounding the wreckage and the cluttered hospitals are a perfectly balanced mix of rawness and polish.  And let's not forget about that musical score.  The best thing about musical incorporates in a film are that they can draw out an emotional response.  Whether it scare, entice, titillate, dramatize or devastate, music has the ability to transport us somewhere, and when accompanied by the right visual it can complete a scene and drive home a deeper impact.  The score created by Fernando Velazquez marvelously captures not only the heartbreak of desperation and the stunning swells of emotional uplift, but it cleverly trickles in an almost `Jaws' like aura of fear with regard to the water, even early on in the film.  It is a very complex score despite the simplicity, and it is possibly the most effective use of music I've seen in a film this year.Listen, the complaints that came over this film have a certain leg to stand on, but not a very strong one.  What director Bayona and screenwriter Sanchez were able to accomplish here was beautifully grounded and heartbreakingly sincere.  Watching one family's desperate attempt to reunite, to survive, to make it through has the power to lift the spirits and give us hope in the power of the human spirit.",5,Forget you; I'm crying...,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,4235,"['Last', 'night', 'wife', 'snuggled', 'up', 'couch', 'finally', 'watch', 'Impossible', 'wound', 'up', 'shedding', 'quite', 'few', 'tears', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'crying', 'time', 'Yes', 'Impossible', 'film', 'designed', 'yank', 'one', 'heartstrings', 'evoke', 'complete', 'outpouring', 'emotions', 'entirely', 'successful', 'fact', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', '2012', 'one', 'most', 'effectively', 'tapped', 'tear', 'ducts.', 'Impossible', 'one', 'films', ""'m"", 'really', 'shocked', 'was', 'not', 'Oscar', 'ballots', 'last', 'year', 'tailor', 'made', 'Oscar', 'yet', 'only', 'managed', 'singular', 'nomination', 'star', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'really', 'deserved', 'more', 'No', ""n't"", 'best', 'film', '2012', 'stunning', 'example', 'director', 'taking', 'hold', 'true', 'story', 'making', 'as', 'impactful', 'possible.Not', 'dry', 'eye.The', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'family', 'vacationing', 'Thailand', '2004', 'when', 'was', 'hit', 'tsunami', ""'m"", 'sure', 'remember', 'news', 'coverage', 'devastating', 'event', 'fact', 'can', 'still', 'see', 'images', 'head', 'videos', 'circulated', 'internet', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'Telling', 'story', 'Maria', 'Belon', 'family', 'who', 'were', 'separated', 'tsunami', 'who', 'eventually', 'reunited', 'varying', 'degrees', 'distress', 'agony', 'Impossible', 'heartbreaking', 'impeccable', 'crafted', 'film', 'certainly', 'spirits', 'as', 'much', 'nearly', 'angle', 'film', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'served', 'one', 'highlights', 'year.The', 'performances', 'are', 'uniformly', 'exceptional', 'Watts', 'who', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'unforgettable', 'internet', 'kind', 'beats', 'down', 'nomination', 'Watts', 'down', 'lot', 'Yes', 'cries', 'screams', 'moans', 'lays', 'there', 'so', 'remarkably', 'well', 'never', 'once', 'doubted', 'pain', 'struggle', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'nailed', 'ounce', 'passion', 'determination', 'smaller', 'more', 'tender', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'beautifully', 'toned', 'mean', 'how', 'can', 'not', 'wretch', 'internal', 'pain', 'when', 'take', 'care', 'babies', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'performance', 'noting', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'spot', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'soulful', 'take', 'Henry', 'tireless', 'resolve', 'find', 'family', 'young', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'keep', 'mother', 'spirit', 'alive', 'waning', 'health', 'Holland', 'particular', 'film', 'new', 'heights', 'more', 'schmaltzy', 'scenes', 'manages', 'breathe', 'naturalness', 'away', 'feeling', 'manipulation', 'fact', 'very', 'heavily', 'manipulative', 'film.This', 'honestly', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'films', '2012', 'certainly', 'more', 'impressive', 'digitally', 'captured', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'way', 'detail', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'right', 'light', 'marvelous', 'thing', 'watch', 'underwater', 'moments', 'are', 'devastatingly', 'grimy', 'sun', 'soaked', 'atmosphere', 'surrounding', 'wreckage', 'cluttered', 'hospitals', 'are', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'mix', 'rawness', 'polish', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'musical', 'score', 'best', 'thing', 'musical', 'incorporates', 'film', 'are', 'can', 'draw', 'out', 'emotional', 'response', 'entice', 'titillate', 'dramatize', 'devastate', 'music', 'ability', 'transport', 'somewhere', 'when', 'accompanied', 'right', 'visual', 'can', 'complete', 'scene', 'drive', 'home', 'deeper', 'impact', 'score', 'created', 'Fernando', 'Velazquez', 'marvelously', 'not', 'only', 'heartbreak', 'desperation', 'stunning', 'swells', 'emotional', 'uplift', 'cleverly', 'almost', 'Jaws', 'aura', 'fear', 'regard', 'water', 'even', 'early', 'film', 'very', 'complex', 'score', 'simplicity', 'possibly', 'most', 'effective', 'use', 'music', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'year.Listen', 'complaints', 'came', 'film', 'have', 'certain', 'leg', 'stand', 'not', 'very', 'strong', 'one', 'What', 'director', 'Bayona', 'screenwriter', 'Sanchez', 'were', 'able', 'accomplish', 'here', 'was', 'beautifully', 'grounded', 'heartbreakingly', 'sincere', 'Watching', 'one', 'family', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'reunite', 'survive', 'make', 'power', 'lift', 'spirits', 'give', 'hope', 'power', 'human', 'spirit']",Impossible

1622709,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B00B74MJOS,Brian Driver,"[0, 0]","This is not only an amazing movie, it's a metamorphic experience: a film of such epic tragedy can make you take a hard look at your own life and rethink some of your priorities. Following what these people went through can truly make what we think of as hardships look really petty and foolish in comparison.THE IMPOSSIBLE is simply stunning; you'll be as astounded by the heartbreaking scope of this catastrophe as you will by the technical skill it must have taken to recreate it. When I heard that the very same hotel location was used to stage this movie, I was staggered.  It actually looks as if the whole island was inundated again by the tsunami that occurred in 2004...the shots are so realistic, so powerful, you wonder how director Antonio Bayona could have put his actors through it - especially the children.While this is a calamity of major proportions, THE IMPOSSIBLE does not try to show the horrors undergone by everyone; after all, such a task would have been impossible.  What Bayona does is follow one family during the tragedy, and in particular the spectacular Naomi Watts (as wife and mother Maria Bennett) and Tom Holland (as 12-year old son Lucas). They were put through hell - not just the characters, but the actors as well. Bayona does a masterful job of displaying the agonizing power of the waves, jerking Watts this way and that like a rag doll in a blender. While she was deservedly nominated for best Actress by the Academy Awards, the Screen Actors' Guild, and the Golden Globes, it's a true oversight that Holland was not: his performance is truly amazing.  It's hard to believe he had only provided the voice for a cartoon character before this movie. So much of the story depends upon the strength he gathers during the nightmare to somehow pull his family together; it's a powerhouse performance that displays what must be a bright future ahead.It is an amazing story all of its own, but to realize that it's true makes it truly astonishing. Yet there are some who have found fault with this movie...without my giving away details of the tale, they criticize the fact that the story centers upon a white family of privilege, when so many Thais are used as background, their suffering marginalized. But this is, after all, Maria's story: she wrote the book upon which the story is based, cataloging the agonies her family went through. It's hard to argue with the film's priorities at that, I think. Certainly the island's horrific torment is here to see, and their agonies are clear. That it focuses on one family actually gives it an immediacy that a wider scope might have missed. It is a story about her struggles, but writ large.I remember immersing myself in the tragedy when it occurred back in 2004, eventually feeling that I had come to an understanding about their struggles and the horrors they went through. But the impact of this movie hit me like a ton of bricks: there is NO way to understand what survivors of such an event must feel. While the force of the waves themselves was staggering, of course, equally horrendous was the disappearance of society, the total stripping away of the structure we always take for granted. Despite any struggles that we go through we always expect that the world will stop and take care of us in our times of need.  Yet THE IMPOSSIBLE is effective at showing us that here ALL is lost and even society itself has been shattered. Not even a bureaucracy can survive such an event.  This movie makes the presence of a simple orange as a thing of beauty, equally so the immediacy of a cell phone. The simple act of someone saying, ""Can I help you?"" is an achingly powerful act of generosity when it is so clear that EVERYONE is suffering here...no one came out unsullied in this tragedy. There is a moment when the central character opens her eyes and asks a three-word question I've heard said in other movies, but here it is an astonishingly powerful three-word phrase: ""Am I dead?""See THE IMPOSSIBLE. It is at once terrifying and reassuring, blisteringly painful yet comforting, heart wrenchingly sad, yet tearfully happy. It is about the stripping away of everything we thought was permanent and the building of a firmament in its place. We see for the first time inside this tragedy, yet we emerge outside with a reborn spirit. It is a powerful, frightening, sad, hopeful, and wonderful movie.",5,A Searingly Powerful Movie,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,4381,"['not', 'only', 'amazing', 'movie', 'metamorphic', 'experience', 'film', 'such', 'epic', 'tragedy', 'can', 'make', 'take', 'hard', 'look', 'own', 'life', 'rethink', 'priorities', 'Following', 'what', 'people', 'went', 'can', 'truly', 'make', 'what', 'think', 'hardships', 'look', 'really', 'petty', 'foolish', 'comparison.THE', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'simply', 'stunning', ""'ll"", 'be', 'astounded', 'heartbreaking', 'scope', 'catastrophe', 'will', 'technical', 'skill', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'recreate', 'When', 'heard', 'very', 'same', 'hotel', 'location', 'was', 'used', 'stage', 'movie', 'was', 'staggered', 'actually', 'whole', 'island', 'was', 'inundated', 'again', 'tsunami', 'occurred', '2004', 'shots', 'are', 'so', 'realistic', 'so', 'powerful', 'wonder', 'how', 'director', 'Antonio', 'Bayona', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'actors', 'especially', 'children.While', 'calamity', 'major', 'proportions', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'not', 'try', 'show', 'horrors', 'undergone', 'everyone', 'task', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'impossible', 'What', 'Bayona', 'follow', 'one', 'family', 'tragedy', 'particular', 'spectacular', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'wife', 'mother', 'Maria', 'Bennett', 'Tom', 'Holland', '12-year', 'old', 'son', 'Lucas', 'were', 'put', 'hell', 'not', 'just', 'characters', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'Bayona', 'masterful', 'job', 'displaying', 'agonizing', 'power', 'waves', 'jerking', 'Watts', 'way', 'rag', 'doll', 'blender', 'was', 'deservedly', 'nominated', 'best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'true', 'oversight', 'Holland', 'was', 'not', 'performance', 'truly', 'amazing', 'hard', 'believe', 'had', 'only', 'provided', 'voice', 'cartoon', 'character', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'story', 'strength', 'nightmare', 'somehow', 'pull', 'family', 'together', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'bright', 'future', 'ahead.It', 'amazing', 'story', 'own', 'realize', 'true', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'are', 'who', 'have', 'found', 'fault', 'movie', 'giving', 'away', 'details', 'tale', 'criticize', 'fact', 'story', 'centers', 'white', 'family', 'privilege', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'Thais', 'are', 'used', 'background', 'suffering', 'marginalized', 'Maria', 'story', 'wrote', 'book', 'story', 'based', 'cataloging', 'agonies', 'family', 'went', 'hard', 'argue', 'film', 'priorities', 'think', 'Certainly', 'island', 'horrific', 'torment', 'here', 'see', 'agonies', 'are', 'clear', 'one', 'family', 'actually', 'immediacy', 'wider', 'scope', 'might', 'have', 'missed', 'story', 'struggles', 'writ', 'large.I', 'remember', 'immersing', 'tragedy', 'when', 'occurred', 'back', '2004', 'eventually', 'feeling', 'had', 'come', 'understanding', 'struggles', 'horrors', 'went', 'impact', 'movie', 'hit', 'ton', 'bricks', 'way', 'understand', 'what', 'survivors', 'such', 'event', 'must', 'feel', 'force', 'waves', 'was', 'staggering', 'course', 'equally', 'horrendous', 'was', 'disappearance', 'society', 'total', 'stripping', 'away', 'structure', 'always', 'take', 'granted', 'struggles', 'go', 'always', 'expect', 'world', 'will', 'stop', 'take', 'care', 'times', 'need', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'effective', 'showing', 'here', 'lost', 'even', 'society', 'been', 'shattered', 'Not', 'even', 'bureaucracy', 'can', 'survive', 'such', 'event', 'movie', 'presence', 'simple', 'orange', 'thing', 'beauty', 'equally', 'immediacy', 'cell', 'phone', 'simple', 'act', 'someone', 'saying', 'Can', 'help', 'achingly', 'powerful', 'act', 'generosity', 'when', 'so', 'clear', 'EVERYONE', 'suffering', 'here', 'one', 'came', 'out', 'unsullied', 'tragedy', 'moment', 'when', 'central', 'character', 'eyes', 'three-word', 'question', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'said', 'other', 'movies', 'here', 'astonishingly', 'powerful', 'three-word', 'phrase', 'Am', 'dead', 'See', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'once', 'terrifying', 'reassuring', 'blisteringly', 'painful', 'yet', 'comforting', 'heart', 'wrenchingly', 'sad', 'yet', 'tearfully', 'happy', 'stripping', 'away', 'everything', 'thought', 'was', 'permanent', 'building', 'firmament', 'place', 'see', 'first', 'time', 'tragedy', 'yet', 'emerge', 'outside', 'reborn', 'spirit', 'powerful', 'frightening', 'sad', 'hopeful', 'wonderful', 'movie']",Impossible

Is his message that when calamity strikes us we suffer great terror and difficulty, but it will all be O.K. in the end? And why are nearly all the other people we meet in this movie also European? Why are there so few Thai people? Why does nearly every one speak English? Amid so much destruction, why do we see barely any dead people?

Yes, there was an element of coincidence at play, but overall the outcome was not really in doubt - at least for cinematic purposes anyway. More distressing however, was the fascination the movie-makers had with showing graphic wounds - especially the mother's. I get it - she was hurt - no need to keep rubbing my face in it.

Perfect, as it's hard to believe that people could be so impossibly civilized.  After all, it seemed that the meanest thing that anyone did here:  refuse to hand his phone over to Ewan McGregor so that Mr. McGregor could check in with his family back home.  I've seen people far less civilized in the checkout line at Safeway.But naturally, this film is probably broken into three standard acts, and luckily for us, we have act one -- which seemed impossibly realistic and amazing -- and the end of act three -- which redeems the film with some believability.  But act two is where it seemed the most impossible to me.For example, let's say that you're in a hospital.  In a faraway place.  And you don't know where your father/husband is, or where your other sons/brothers are.  Wouldn't you at this point spend any possible effort and time that you have searching for those people in your own family, instead of perhaps helping others -- others that you've never met, and will surely never meet again -- find members of their family?  But naturally, this is a movie so one of our main protagonists here searches a hospital, trying to reunite those strangers for no apparent reason, other than to play Haley Joel Osment in a reenactment of ""Pay it Forward.""Believe me, I take no pleasure in finding any weakness in this weepy flick.  I'm a big fan of Naomi Watts -- who isn't? -- but this film should have been more balanced.  I wasn't even near the area where the tsunami killed a quarter of a million people almost a decade ago, but I didn't have to be to tell you the following:  in times of crises, people in general are at their worst.  Sure, you'll find a few heroes here and there.  But looting and crime are more likely, none of which we see here.But still, the opening act is worth the price of admission.

This film hasn't received the prestige treatment that others have in a year that has seen exceptional films, but it should have.The movie starts with a family visiting a resort off the coast of Thailand during the Christmas holiday of 2004. The mother, father, and three sons seem unremarkable on the face of it. They are just nice though the viewer really never is given much insight into their lives prior to their vacation or the events that have preceded the day after Christmas. On December 26, 2004 the family is kicking back around the resort's pool after their Christmas celebration the night before.In a moment that seems as unremarkable as the family itself, the ordinary is replaced by the surge of a wall of water guaranteed to horrify. A tsunami rushes in and destroys everything and everyone in a flash. As the family struggles against the surge they are separated. Thus begins a story of profound loss, survival, uncertainty, and lives that will inevitably impacted and changed forever. In the process there are gestures of sympathy and kindness, both large and small in their simplicity that echo the inherent goodness in people regardless of their age or position in life. As the family struggles to reunite with great uncertainty of what lies ahead, the viewer gets involved not only with the disaster and its inevitable horror but also with the human struggle to survive and also deal with loss.I expected this to be a rough movie to watch. When this event occurred I was transfixed and depressed by what I saw on TV and knew what would follow. As this film played out, what surprised me was the there was an upside to the tragedy which was portrayed. The struggle to survive and the kindness of complete strangers was life affirming and spiritually uplifting. For me, using the device of a family in peril removed this from the category of disaster story to a human story that spoke for both the victims and the survivors of an unparalleled disaster in current times.The special effects were very realistic. The photography as well as the pacing of this movie were just right. The acting in this movie was great. Naomi Watts was nominated for an Academy Award for a powerful performance as the mother Maria, but there were many fine performances in this movie. Ewan McGregor as Henry her husband and Tom Holland as the son Lucas who Maria struggles to save, contribute to elevating this story on a dramatic level. In fact, Tom Holland was absolutely remarkable.This was a beautifully done film and one which will stay with me for a long time.",5,Stunning Movie That Affirms Life And The Ability To Survive,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,2609,"['just', 'saw', 'Impossible', 'movies', 'today', 'film', ""n't"", 'received', 'prestige', 'treatment', 'others', 'have', 'year', 'seen', 'exceptional', 'films', 'should', 'have.The', 'movie', 'family', 'visiting', 'resort', 'coast', 'Thailand', 'Christmas', 'holiday', '2004', 'mother', 'father', 'three', 'sons', 'seem', 'unremarkable', 'face', 'are', 'just', 'nice', 'viewer', 'really', 'never', 'given', 'much', 'insight', 'lives', 'prior', 'vacation', 'events', 'have', 'preceded', 'day', 'Christmas', 'December', '26', '2004', 'family', 'kicking', 'back', 'resort', 'pool', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'night', 'moment', 'as', 'unremarkable', 'family', 'ordinary', 'replaced', 'surge', 'wall', 'water', 'guaranteed', 'horrify', 'tsunami', 'rushes', 'destroys', 'everything', 'everyone', 'flash', 'family', 'surge', 'are', 'separated', 'Thus', 'story', 'profound', 'loss', 'survival', 'uncertainty', 'will', 'inevitably', 'impacted', 'changed', 'forever', 'process', 'are', 'gestures', 'sympathy', 'kindness', 'large', 'small', 'simplicity', 'inherent', 'goodness', 'people', 'regardless', 'age', 'position', 'life', 'family', 'reunite', 'great', 'uncertainty', 'what', 'ahead', 'viewer', 'involved', 'not', 'only', 'disaster', 'inevitable', 'horror', 'also', 'human', 'struggle', 'survive', 'also', 'deal', 'loss.I', 'expected', 'be', 'rough', 'movie', 'watch', 'When', 'event', 'occurred', 'was', 'transfixed', 'depressed', 'what', 'saw', 'TV', 'knew', 'what', 'would', 'follow', 'film', 'played', 'out', 'what', 'surprised', 'was', 'was', 'upside', 'tragedy', 'was', 'portrayed', 'struggle', 'survive', 'kindness', 'complete', 'strangers', 'was', 'life', 'affirming', 'spiritually', 'uplifting', 'using', 'device', 'family', 'peril', 'removed', 'category', 'disaster', 'story', 'human', 'story', 'spoke', 'victims', 'survivors', 'unparalleled', 'disaster', 'current', 'times.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'very', 'realistic', 'photography', 'as', 'well', 'pacing', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'right', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'powerful', 'performance', 'mother', 'Maria', 'were', 'many', 'fine', 'performances', 'movie', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Henry', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'son', 'Lucas', 'who', 'Maria', 'save', 'contribute', 'elevating', 'story', 'dramatic', 'level', 'fact', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'was', 'absolutely', 'remarkable.This', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time']",Impossible

Great acting and action with a lot of heart. It's pretty visceral, so be ready to get a gut-wrenching feel for what it may have been like to try and survive in the middle of the chaos. I think they did an outstanding job making it look real and keeping the action and drama going after the initial impact. The dialogue isn't exactly out of The King's Speech, Lincoln, or a Shakespeare play but with something like this you really just needed the key actors (Watts & Holland) to get the emotions across and for the filmmakers to make it look and feel real, which they all did in a powerful way. And while the actual video footage of this tsunami was relatively limited for its scale, compared to all the footage of the more recent and less fatal Japanese tsunami, the filmmakers really got it right and did a good job expanding on it for what little they had to go by.",5,Like being there,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1043,"['Very', 'immersive', 'depiction', 'tragic', 'tsunami', '12/26/04', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'one', 'family', 'experience', 'spending', 'Christmas', 'resort', 'holiday', 'Thailand', 'Great', 'acting', 'action', 'lot', 'heart', 'pretty', 'visceral', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'get', 'gut-wrenching', 'feel', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'try', 'survive', 'middle', 'chaos', 'think', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'making', 'look', 'real', 'keeping', 'action', 'drama', 'going', 'initial', 'impact', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'King', 'Speech', 'Lincoln', 'Shakespeare', 'play', 'something', 'really', 'just', 'needed', 'key', 'actors', 'Watts', 'Holland', 'get', 'emotions', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'look', 'feel', 'real', 'did', 'powerful', 'way', 'actual', 'video', 'footage', 'tsunami', 'was', 'relatively', 'limited', 'scale', 'compared', 'footage', 'more', 'recent', 'less', 'fatal', 'Japanese', 'tsunami', 'filmmakers', 'really', 'got', 'right', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'expanding', 'what', 'little', 'had', 'go']",Impossible

""The Impossible"" is not so much a disaster film but a testament of will and perserverence  in the most trying of circumstances.  The filmmakers let us in on the fate of the individual members of the Bennett family but the mystery here is whether they will reunite amidst the chaos.  Naomi Watts and Ewen McGregor are outstanding as the parents but the real glue to the film is the performance of Tom Holland as the eldest son, Lucas.  In Holland's first screen role he projects strength and has real presence.  A lot of the storylines depend on his character and Holland is more than up to the task.  The only thing you can really fault the film for is that the Bennett's real life counterparts were Spanish.

The acting and overall ambience of the movie powerfully conveys a sense of presence, a sense of actually being there that makes it hard to believe you are just watching a movie performed by actors.The story follows the experiences of a family of five who are vacationing in a small resort facility on the coast of Thailand when the tsunami of December, 2004 strikes the coast where they are vacationing. Each of the five family members is brilliantly cast and turns in performances that surpass the word performance; you feel you are watching real people really living through a terrible tragedy that will change their lives forever.Each of the family members turns in totally convincing performances and are deserving of the highest praise. Henry, the father played by Ewan McGregor; Maria, the mother, played by Naomi Watts; Lucas, the oldest son, played by Tom Holland; Thomas, the middle son played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, the youngest son played by Oaklee Pendergast all turn in realistic portrayals that convince the viewer they are watching events unfold in real time.Equal praise is due to the director, J. A. Bayona, and the writers, Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez, and Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n. Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n Alv&aacute;rez, who is a Spanish physician, is the real Maria who actually lived the experience recorded by the movie. Maria and her husband Enrique and three sons Lucas, Sim&oacute;n, and Tom&aacute;s Bel&oacute;n are the ones portrayed in the movie.Although this is a story of tragedy, it is also a story of love, devotion, and loyalty that is inspirational and positive. It does have some very intense moments and may be unsettling to more sensitive members of the family.

Some terrific use of real disaster footage seemed welded seamlessly with CGI to put the viewer right into the struggle for survival.  Some of the subsequent tsunami's -- like the 2011 Japanese event involving nuclear power plants -- reminds us how utterly destructive these events can be.  The appearance of low-lying Thai landscape strewn with the detris and victims was distressingly realistic.  Movies based on real life always seem more gripping to me and this tale seemed to stick reasonably close to reality.  There were ~ 200,000 fatalities in this tsunami, and I would not have been surprised at any number of deaths in the family portrayed in this story.  Some have criticized the film for focusing on one European family when so many of the victims were from the native populations.  This of course resulted from the book having been written by a European, about this family, and he survived to write it.

Smith,"[1, 2]","The first thing I had to ask, from when I first got news of the tsunami, is only complete idiots and people too spoiled for life would travel from the U.S. or Europe to spend Christmas in a southeast Asian coastal tourist attraction.  Christmas is a holy time, with church, and home, and family, and even amid the celebrating and presents Christmas isn't Christmas without the sense of the sacred and the ties to home.This couple seem typical; plagued by financial worries they still take a plane to stay in a swank hotel, and the fact that they appear to be temporarily stranded in Japan for the father's work to begin with doesn't excuse it.The couple behave like complete idiots from minute 1.  It starts when it doesn't occur to either mother or son to stay in a tree once one catches ahold of one.  The father sends his five and six year old off to some unknown destination alone with people he doesn't even know; it's a wonder they weren't sold into prostitution or slavery like tens of thousands of children caught in that disaster.  He stays behind to look for his wife and eldest son who from what he knows are probably dead and certainly not both nearby and able to answer his shouts.The movie often drags.  It takes twenty minutes to even get going.  The end drags as well.  Parts of the middle drag.The ending is improbable.  I know for a fact that people characteristically looked for days or weeks for loved ones.  This family happen to come together and find each other by a pure series of accidents.  I don't think so!Finally, we are never told how the financially strapped upper middle class family manage to have a private plane fly them to civilization - and only the villagers who rescue the mother and the eldest son ever manage to think of putting clothing on them.  They are still barefoot when they get on the plane. Some of them are still covered with blood, despite days of wandering.

1622788,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00B74MJOS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","THE IMPOSSIBLE (Spanish-made and originally titled LO IMPOSIBLE, 2012, 114 minutes) is the most horrifying and suspenseful disaster film I have ever seen. It is set in Thailand that fateful Christmas 2004, when the horrific Indian Ocean tsunami hit that entire region of Asia. This is the story of the Spanish Belon Family, who were there and survived.In the film they are the English Bennett Family: Dad (Ewan MacGregor), Mum (Naomi Watts), and the three brothers, the oldest boy Lucas (Tom Holland for whom I see a tremendous future), and the little ones, Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin). It is based on the true story of the Belon Family, their miraculous survival and rescue from a ravaged Thailand.For some unfathomable reason, the Bennetts are spending Christmas in Thailand where it seems lots of white European folk were at the time of the tsunami. In fact like all of this film, virtually no questions are answered about anything. When the tsunami hits, Mum and Lucas become the protagonists. Their survival and dependence upon each other constitute the main hinges of the film.Only later does the film focus on the father, who has the two younger boys with him, on his quest to find his wife and his other son Lucas.I have to say this film made me weep. The sheer suffering and its graphic depiction will haunt you for a long time. Cinematically, I was a bit angered that they stole from Clint Eastwood's metaphysical fantasyHereafter(see my review) yet they were unable to match Eastwood's immersion of the audience into the experience.In HEREAFTER, the character is in exactly the same place at the same time. And I'd be willing to bet money, even without a copy of HEREAFTER, that they took the same footage Eastwood used. In THE IMPOSSIBLE, the audience is called upon to witness the horror of being swept away by a tsunami, rather than to actually experience it as Eastwood was able to accomplish. I learned that the extras on this film were survivors of the tsunami - I mention that because I do not know where Eastwood accomplished his superior movie magic.Those are not the only bones I have to pick with the makers of this true story.Why the father and two younger boys disappear from the film's storyline in the wake of the tsunami is anyone's guess, and a lot of tension, or good storytelling, was lost with that. The film answers no mysteries, such as why the family are in Thailand at all, ranging all the way to the disappointingly limp ending, when a mysterious insurance agent shows up in a shiny new helicopter solely to rescue the Bennetts.If memory serves, over 200,000 died in that tsunami. What one wishes in these scenarios is not only the happiness of a successful reunion. One wants to know more about what happened to all the others. One wants to know why certain things unfolded as they did, and why Mum at the end of the film mysteriously has the name of an English woman written on her arm. It continues to escape me who would have written that name, when, and why. I know Mum didn't do it - she didn't ever have the chance.Dad and Lucas of course have lists of names, people they had hoped they could help find. Only MacGregor acquits himself well in this scene, looking up in sudden anguish, knowing he didn't even help find those names on his list. Wondering if they lived, or where they might be, MacGregor suddenly turns green. Only Lucas succeeded in reuniting a little boy with his father, but at the end when he is scanning his list he only seems slightly irritated.As I said, the end of the film was a limp noodle, a sudden let's-get-out-of-here ending I've seen too many times. It causes us to wonder, artistically, how far should a director go to make the audience feel what the director wants them to feel, at the expense of the broader issues. Shouldn't the director show us what happened, show us the story, rather than force us to feel every little pain, every great anguish, witnessing every horrible detail regarding the Bennetts?The rest of the human suffering was reduced to rapid glimpses and horrid screams, making this film more like a horror movie. I was never in a tsunami, but as a boy I witnessed the ravages of a great flood in southern Mexico. That will haunt me for the rest of my life, and when I saw this film I realized I didn't need to add to that experience.A warning: with this film, you might feel the same as me. You might think to yourself, ""I didn't need to see that, I didn't want to know.""

First of all, I'm no bleeding heart, but even I was shocked that it focuses almost exclusively on the effect the tsunami had on wealthy white Europeans, virtually ignoring the hundreds of thousands of Thai natives who died or were injured, except when body bags are used as props. The live residents of Thailand play one dimensional supporting roles and are never fleshed out. Second, nearly every shot is a close up, and many of those extreme close ups, of the actors' battered faces. The camera almost never backs off to show the performers interacting with one another. Everyone delivers most of their lines in a solitary closeup. Third, the massive response by the U.S. Navy and other international aid is never even alluded to.VAGUE SO AS NOT TO SPOIL: I wondered why everyone else back at the hotel managed to get cleaned up and find some clothes, but one key character stays bloody and half naked until nearly the end of the movie.

Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE  achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO IMPOSIBLE: Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by &Oacute;scar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by S&ouml;nke M&ouml;hring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing.  But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him.

It is an unnervingly realistic account of one family's dispair and impossible survival despite all odds.English/Scottish couple Maria and Henry (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) and their three young boys have made the fateful decision to holiday in beautiful Thailand over Christmas. No one could have been prepared for the horrors of a tsunami turning miles of lush, beautiful countryside into a disaster zone.The amazing realism of the tsunami and the sense of what it is like to be pulled under the water as tons of debris swirl around you is made very clear in THE IMPOSSIBLE. The realism pulls you into its own tsunami as seconds seem to last for hours. The constant movement of debris and of human beings in the churning violent water can be too much to bear at times but this is realism at its finest.Here is one family's story. It's just one of countless stories that may never be told. It's even more a story of a mother and her son as they fight for survival and eventually hope to be reunited with the rest of their family. This is the true story of Maria Belon and her family. Ironically, the real Spanish family is now English/Scottish and their names (except for Maria's) are now anglicized.There are amazing performances by newcomer Tom Holland (as oldest son Lucas)and Watts and McGregor. Watts brings us the pain and despair of the real Maria in her desperate struggle for life and to reunite her family. It's an amazing journey into the love and faith of one family. THE IMPOSSIBLE focuses on one family and there has been some criticism of that fact, yet their story is just one piece of an enormous puzzle. Maria Belon seriously promoted her story and survival so nothing is being given away by knowing this is a story of one family's survival.There is a human interest story here of how people from different nationalities come together in a tragedy. There is only a brief interaction with an uninjured couple upset about the inconvenience of not being able to quickly book a flight home. How many people reacted that way? It's a subject for another film.The scenes of the tsunami are beyond incredible and the depiction of compassion and kindess are heartwarming. A mother's love for her son is so clear through Watts's performance and the sadness of a young boy suddenly having to become a man is tough. THE IMPOSSIBLE slows down as Watts is in the hospital but then we pick up Henry's story with the two younger sons. Neither half of the separated family knows the fate of the other. No family should ever be in that situation.THE IMPOSSIBLE will upset and unnerve some simply because of its realistic depiction of the world's biggest recorded tsunami. Watts and McGregor prove they are world class actors and young Tom Holland is an amazing newcomer with all the emotions of a boy forced into manhood.

I could argue that these locals are portrayed in the very best light: they instantly spring to the aid of any and everyone, are kind, considerate and life-saving whenever possible.Director Juan Antonio Bayona (""The Orphanage"") has created a masterpiece that is surely the envy of directors who specialize in disaster films. The scope of this one is astonishing. I have no idea how much of it is Computer Generated Imaging, how much is from news clips and how much was staged, but suffice it to say, it is truly impressive. First the tsunami itself, then the ravaged land with the villagers who immediately come to help, the field hospitals that are quickly set up and the emergency care that is mobilized, are mind-boggling. All combine to make me proud that I'm a human being.As expected, the adults in this film are terrific, but the children are exceptional! The PG-13 rating is for the intensity of the suffering and the scope of the tsunami. A loving family is what we are there to see and we get to see it!

Think if this had been about Katrina, and some folks from Europe or somewhere had their vacation to New Orleans ruined, a few scares, some injuries, but nothing too life altering, and then they flew home. Oh how compelling! Add in the fact that the writer, aside from not caring to deeply about the Thai people, also seems to have something against Canadians and/or Americans. Anyone who had an accent that would indicate they were from the U.S. or Canada is a total piece of garbage in this movie! One Canadian or American woman even abandons these Australian kids--who does that?! No one, that's who.

1622867,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B00B74MJOS,kacunnin,"[0, 0]","THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.  Even though it's set during that horrific tragedy, it's really the story of one family's really bad Christmas vacation.  Maria Bennett (Naomi Watts) and her husband Henry (Ewan McGregor) are ex-pat Brits living in Japan when they decide to spend Christmas at a beachfront resort in Thailand.  The film begins with a few quick scenes of the family's arrival at the resort (the three boys are sniping and whining a bit, like all kids do, and Maria and Henry are worried about whether or not they set the alarm back home and whether or not Henry's is about to lose his job). Of course none of that matters when the tsunami hits.  Maria and her oldest son, Lucas, manage to find each other in the aftermath, but there's no sign of Henry or the younger boys.  Maria and Lucas struggle to survive, are helped by some really nice locals, and end up in a crazy-crowded rural hospital trying to deal with the onslaught of victims.  Eventually we find out what happened to Henry and the boys and everyone gets to go home.  It's a feel-good movie that's a little hard to watch as it's unfolding - but don't worry, it will all be okay in the end.Most of the criticism this movie has received has revolved around two issues - first, there's too little about what actually happened during and after the tsunami, and second, the director (Juan Antonio Bayona) decided to cast generic white actors to play a Spanish family.  As I said at the start of this review, THE IMPOSSIBLE is not a film about the tsunami.  Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez aren't interested in giving us a wide-angle picture of what happened to Thailand or to the Thai people or to any of the other countries and people devastated by the tsunami.  They are interested in the Bennett family - or in Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n's family, to be more accurate.  S&aacute;nchez's screenplay was based on Bel&oacute;n's story about how she and her husband (not McGregor's Henry, but Quique Alvarez) survived their Thai holiday in 2004.  And as a survival story, the film works.But what about that second complaint?  Does the film suffer because of Bayona's decision not to hire Spanish actors to play his suffering family?  Apparently Maria and Quique don't think so.  Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n worked closely with both Bayona and writer S&aacute;nchez to make sure that what happens on screen really happened to her family.  And the film makes no attempt to hide the reality of who this family really was - their names and photographs appear at the end of the film, just before the closing credits.  While I do think it would have been interesting to see Spanish actors playing these characters, it in no way changes what is an inspirational and emotionally gripping story.Bottom line, THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of those survival films that will have you chewing your nails, weeping uncontrollably, and praying to God that nothing like this ever happens to you.  It's about survival in its most basic sense.  And if it all seems a bit ""feel-good"" in the end, then it's done its job.

This is an upper class family of five (parents Maria and Henry, and three sons, Lucas, the oldest at around 12, Thomas, next at around 6 or 7, and Simon maybe 4 years old). They are staying at what appears to be a 5 star ocean front resort. On December 26, the day after Christmas, as all five are enjoying themselves at the pool. Maria opts to relax and read a book, while enjoying the antics of her ""boys.""The impossible happens so quickly, nobody has time to gather family members let alone try to get to safety. One minute Maria was standing by a glass wall retrieving some pages of a book which had been caught up in an unexpected strong breeze. As she picks up the pages, she stops, listens and KNOWS something is wrong. As the waves cascaded over the front of the resort and finally hit the pool area, all she could do was scream for her husband and children before being picked up and swept crashing through the window, through every kind of manmade and natural pieces of things smashed by the water.This is probably every person's nightmare. What I would like to try to convey to you that touched me so deeply in this movie was, first of all the realism that at times was excruciating to watch. I had thought that Maria would have been at the heart and soul of this tragic event replayed for us to see what mayhem can lay around the corner for any of us. But it was Thomas whose story became central as he found his mother in the initial incoming mess and literally saved her life. This young boy was exposed to a terrifying event at such a young age and proved to be a leader, a caretaker, a sleuth and ultimately the tie that pulled the family back together in the midst of chaos.I have read much about that tsunami, and judging by the fact that the water at their resort became shallow quickly, they were at the edge of this catastrophe. Even so, this movie made far more real, to me, the events as they took place over the next 24 hours. Yes, some scenes were difficult to watch and I cried a lot throughout it. But at the very heart of this movie, as this well off family is reduced to the level of the poorest native, was the intense kindness conveyed by many who made this same journey (not all were kind, though, and happily, Maria Belon, who takes story credit, chose not to dwell on the negative, but to let the shining light of who we can be to each other as humans, experiencing a horrific event at the same time).I am glad I watched this movie. Happy to see there is yet hope for humanity despite the things going on around us today. There were no heroes, no take charge fixer, just a lot of people trying to stay alive and find their loved ones. Let me take that back. There were many, many heroes that day, but today we will never know their names. I have one quibble with the movie which I have debated whether to drop a star or not. At the very end, when they were flown to better facilities, they flew in a rather large, empty jet. I was left wondering why, with what looked like tens of thousands of people left in sweltering heat, many with still bleeding injuries, many wearing torn clothing and no shoes. It seemed to me that this family was the type to at least try to see if others needed a lift. Perhaps they did and it didn't fit in the movie.I highly recommend this movie if you just want a good look at humanity in chaos and how people behaved. For me, it was uplifting and hopeful. I wish the Belon family long and happy, blessed lives. For it was nothing short of a miracle, it was nearly impossible that they made it out, all five, as an intact family with mostly treatable injuries. This story opened my eyes to the many other catastrophes that seem to be taking place more and more today. It left me wanting to be involved in somehow helping people in each instance. I won't soon forget The Impossible. It left an indelible mark on my heart.",5,Excellent Movie.

Gordon,"[0, 0]","Amazing effects and stunts along with and solid performances balance out some artistic lapses and ethical questionsin this true story of one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami  that killed 300,000.The downsides; there's something a little off-putting about choosing a white, privileged family as a focus, while at thesame time showing almost exclusively other white people as suffering and afraid in a disaster that killed far more localpeople than tourists.  The Thai's are certainly shown in a good light, kindly helping all these suffering whites, but evenin the hospital, almost every face we see in a bed is a white one.  That hint of odd racial insensitivity is also underlinedby replacing the original family, who were Spanish and dark, and making them into a gorgeous blond English family, atelling choice in a `true' story.On a more general level, the film can feel manipulative, from the tear jerking score, to the multiple ""will they spot each other?""shots that feel like a horror film's self-conscious suspense creating frames, but that technique feels strangely artificial in thismore naturalistic setting.

1622875,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00B74MJOS,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[151, 166]","Going into a movie like ""The Impossible,"" I knew exactly what to expect. Based on the real life experiences of Maria Belon (who takes a story credit) and her family, the film focuses on the harrowing tsunami that devastated Thailand in 2004. ""The Impossible"" never attempts to be anything more than it is and that is much to its credit. In a waking nightmare, the simple story highlights one family affected by the trauma. Separated, injured, and scared beyond belief, it recounts the struggle to stay alive and the quest to reconnect. This is NOT a film about plot, however, for the outcome is predetermined (and pretty much given away in the marketing even if you haven't heard any peripheral information). This is solely about the journey. And with a handful of remarkable performances and with sweeping effects, the movie works on an entirely visceral level that is likely to leave you emotionally drained. While perhaps not perfect, it is a gut wrenching experience that is hard to shake.Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor step into the primary roles despite the fact that the real life Belons were from Spain. In fact, this is the first English language film by respected Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage). Nationality differences aside, Bayona has crafted a movie with universal appeal. The love of family crosses all cultural borders, and the heart of the screenplay recognizes this with unwavering clarity. Watts and McGregor are enjoying Christmas with their three sons at a posh seaside resort as the film opens. Truthfully, we don't get to know too much about the clan. They are painted in fairly broad strokes as a perfect little family unit. But their idyllic holiday is cut short one morning as a tsunami rips across the country. The remainder of the film plays out as a story of survival, hope and perseverance. I don't really need to divulge more than that other than to say I was completely swept up in this aftermath.Watts (an Oscar nominee here) opens herself fully to the emotional strength of a mother attempting to protect her brood even if she's no longer capable of taking care of herself. McGregor is terrific, as well, forging ahead with dogged determination. A long time fan, this is one of his more satisfying roles of late. But perhaps the unsung star of the piece is young Tom Holland. Playing the eldest son, Holland has perhaps the biggest and most complex role as this event has thrust him into new responsibilities. In my opinion, Holland should have been invited to awards season for his well rounded and dynamic work! Another real star of ""The Impossible,"" though, are its incredible effects and production design. The realism of the tsunami and its devastation is integral to the story and it is handled expertly. There are literally moments that I won't soon forget!Even though I knew the outcome, I was wholeheartedly invested in following ""The Impossible"" to the end. At times, it borders on melodrama (especially in the final scenes) and it might have used some more in-depth characterization. But as an emotional experience, this film punched me in the gut and never let go. And if a movie can truly move me (I'm pretty jaded and hard hearted), it earns high marks in my book. An intensely satisfying epic, I really connected to this one. About 4 1/2 stars, I'll round up for Holland's star making turn.

This movie focuses on one happy foreign family on vacation visiting from Japan.The movie starts very slowly with hardly any dialogue, and at times is filmed as if with a hand held video camera.  Knowing this movie is about the tsunami you know it's not going to be happy for very long and without much wasted time the tsunami quickly hits.  The story continues, long and drawn out.  The movie is quiet, nothing but ruin as far as the eye can see.  Lotst of wasted time and fast forward moments.The movie picks up more when they finally get to the makeshift hospital scenes, but again, not a whole lot happens there either. You aren't provided with much back story, who the people are, or where these hospitals are located. You have no idea where all of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers came from.The wife is on deaths door one minute, goes into surgery and is on an airplane home the next.  No time frames are given.While there isn't much dialogue, there certainly isn't any bad language. There is however, scary moments of being swept away to sea, dead bodies, and open flesh wounds.  Gaping flesh wounds really.I certainly wasn't impressed with this movie.  I learned nothing more about the tsunami, the destruction, the death toll, the miracles, the hope, the survival, the rebuilding, the volunteers, etc.  It seemed more like it was thrown together in haste to be the first movie of its kind to air.

Oleson,"[12, 15]","This epic film recounts one family's struggle to survive the massive tsunami coming out of the Indian Ocean in 2004, striking the luxurious beach front resorts of Thailand and into the inland areas. A Spanish production under the direction of Juan Antonio Bayona with a script from Sergio G. Sanchez, the real-life Spanish family is replaced by one from Britain headed by Henry (Ewan McGregor) and Maria (Naomi Watts).They and their 3 boys, ranging in age from about 4 to 13, are swept up in the giant waves that hit the country the day after Christmas. Maria and the oldest boy Lucas (Tom Holland) are literally thrown together as the water takes them deep into the interior. The film follows them after the impact of the wave.Speaking of the wave. This is one of the most dramatic and authentic disaster scenes I can remember. Yes, the thunderous wave hitting the resort is a marvelous example of what talented filmmakers can do, but the underwater shots of Lucas and his mother being tossed about along with bicycles, cars and furniture is indeed frightening and realistic. The story essentially shows the survival skills of an injured Maria (a non-practicing M.D.) and Lucas. Another follows Henry and the 2 younger boys (Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast) as they look for the rest of their family.The performances are wonderful from everyone involved. McGregor has never been better as the rational but determined husband and father. I would hope Oscar would give some attention to Ms. Watts. In a performance that reminded me of John Hawkes in ""The Sessions,"" Watts must perform for the most part, laid out on a gurney or hospital bed. Her emotions and despair come from her facial expressions and her eyes. In a year filled with great performances from young actors, I would include Holland as the kid about to make a big leap toward manhood. I think most people will identify with Lucas while watching this film, hoping you would act like him or hope to have a child with his courage and conviction.While impossible to keep tears at bay (even without some of the swelling violins), I found the film to be ultimately uplifting and enormously spellbinding. While I wouldn't expect a commercial film like this to necessarily focus on the more than a quarter million citizens killed, I did think a footnote at the end of the film would have been appropriate to highlight the severity of this tragedy.The Blu ray version has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Audio options include a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  Subtitles are available for English (SDH) and Spanish.",5,4 1/2 stars for a remarkable and ultimately uplifting dramatic film,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",2013,2598,"['epic', 'film', 'one', 'family', 'struggle', 'survive', 'massive', 'tsunami', 'coming', 'Indian', 'Ocean', '2004', 'striking', 'luxurious', 'beach', 'front', 'resorts', 'Thailand', 'inland', 'areas', 'Spanish', 'production', 'direction', 'Juan', 'Antonio', 'Bayona', 'script', 'Sergio', 'G.', 'Sanchez', 'real-life', 'Spanish', 'family', 'replaced', 'one', 'Britain', 'headed', 'Henry', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Maria', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '.They', '3', 'boys', 'ranging', 'age', 'about', '4', '13', 'are', 'swept', 'up', 'giant', 'waves', 'hit', 'country', 'day', 'Christmas', 'Maria', 'oldest', 'boy', 'Lucas', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'are', 'literally', 'thrown', 'together', 'water', 'deep', 'interior', 'film', 'impact', 'wave.Speaking', 'wave', 'one', 'most', 'dramatic', 'authentic', 'disaster', 'scenes', 'can', 'remember', 'Yes', 'thunderous', 'wave', 'hitting', 'resort', 'marvelous', 'example', 'what', 'talented', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'do', 'underwater', 'shots', 'Lucas', 'mother', 'being', 'tossed', 'bicycles', 'cars', 'furniture', 'indeed', 'frightening', 'realistic', 'story', 'essentially', 'survival', 'skills', 'injured', 'Maria', 'non-practicing', 'M.D', 'Lucas', 'Henry', '2', 'younger', 'boys', 'Samuel', 'Joslin', 'Oaklee', 'Pendergast', 'look', 'rest', 'family.The', 'performances', 'are', 'wonderful', 'everyone', 'involved', 'McGregor', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'rational', 'determined', 'husband', 'father', 'would', 'hope', 'Oscar', 'would', 'give', 'attention', 'Ms.', 'Watts', 'performance', 'reminded', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'Sessions', 'Watts', 'must', 'perform', 'most', 'part', 'laid', 'out', 'gurney', 'hospital', 'bed', 'emotions', 'despair', 'come', 'facial', 'expressions', 'eyes', 'year', 'filled', 'great', 'performances', 'young', 'actors', 'would', 'include', 'Holland', 'kid', 'make', 'big', 'leap', 'manhood', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'identify', 'Lucas', 'watching', 'film', 'hoping', 'would', 'act', 'hope', 'have', 'child', 'courage', 'conviction.While', 'impossible', 'keep', 'tears', 'bay', 'even', 'swelling', 'violins', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'enormously', 'spellbinding', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'commercial', 'film', 'necessarily', 'focus', 'more', 'quarter', 'million', 'citizens', 'killed', 'did', 'think', 'footnote', 'end', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'appropriate', 'highlight', 'severity', 'tragedy.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', '1080p', 'resolution', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Audio', 'options', 'include', 'lossless', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'track', 'Subtitles', 'are', 'available', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish']",Impossible

1622960,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00B74MJOS,Paul Allaer,"[13, 18]","""The Impossible"" (2012 release; 113 min.) brings the story (based on true events) of the Bellon family vacationing in Thailand on the eve of the largest tsunami recorded in history (December 26, 2004). Maria (played by Naomi Watts) and Henry (played by Ewan McGregor) are with their 3 boys, ages 5 to 12. Fifteen minutes into the movie, and the tsunami hits. I have never seen anything like it before (blowing away any comparison to Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter""). The next 30 min. are some of the more harrowing I have seen in a movie in a long, long time. It is truly hard to describe the devastation that we get to witness. Maria and her 12 yr. old son Lucas (played by Tom Holland) are split off from the rest of their family, and try to hang on for dear life (literally). To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, the acting performance from Naomi Watts is superb, playing a heavily wounded/half-dead woman who nevertheless wants to do what she can to save her family. Newcomer Tom Holland as the 12 yr. old Lucas is very effective as well. Second, the photography of the movie is visually astonishing, creating images that will stay with me for quite some time. Third, interestingly this is not a American or British production, but in fact it is entirely Spanish, from the director (J.A. Bayona) on down, the entire crew is Spanish. Last but certainly not least, despite the scenes of the tsunami, this is not a 'disaster movie' but instead it is a tribute to the human spirit. It is in the most devastating and impossible of situations such as this tsunami where we see that so many strangers from many different countries nevertheless find a way to communicate and help each other out. In that sense, this is a very uplifting movie.""The Impossible"" is a powerful movie that packs a lot of emotional wallop. I will admit to tearing up quite a few times in the movie. This movie is rated PG-13 but there is no way that I would take a 12 or 13 yr. old kid to see this.

Some 500 miles to the north, at the Orchid Beach resort in Khao Lak, Thailand, the Bel&oacute;n family was enjoying their second day of vacation. Soon, however, they and millions of other unfortunate individuals would experience the one of the most destructive tsunamis in history. A tsunami is a great ocean wave generated by an earthquake. In this case, several waves struck the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, leveling everything in their path and killing as many as 315,000 people. This movie, in a 10-minute sequence of astounding, terrifying detail, depicts what happened to the Bel&oacute;ns when the tsunami overwhelmed the beachside resort. Their ordeal is portrayed by the fictional Bennett family: Henry, the husband; Maria, the wife, and their three sons, Lukas, Thomas and Simon, as we watch their impossible story unfold. Director Bayona and his crew created what might be the most realistic depiction of a waterbourne disaster ever brought to the screen. In the process, we get to see two great acting performances - one by Naomi Watts as Maria, and the other by 16-year-old Tom Holland as Lukas. Together, they're as riveting as two actors can be, portraying people literally swept away from their quiet, normal lives by the immense power of nature.

And it did, but that was a great thing.The first half of the movie had Naomi Watts' character and her son fighting against the tide to not only survive, but reunite with each other. Once the water recedes, we see they the extent of the damage and are left to wonder how anyone could have survived. But the story is focused on the family of five and we see the mother's mangled leg. That's all the foreshadowing we need to know something bad is going to happen.Until this point we are left to believe her husband and two younger sons are dead. Minor spoiler, but they aren't. After she and her son make it to relative safety, the story jumps to Ewan McGregor's character as he searches for his wife and son. I don't want to give away the whole thing, but when McGregor finally gets a cell phone and is able to call home-the way he loses it really gets to you.The drama definitely doesn't end after the tsunami is over. The one drawback is the extreme coincidence that happens at the end. It's a little on the heavy-handed side and strikes as disingenuous.

1622987,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00B74MJOS,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of the more viscerally gripping movies of 2012. It has enough problems to prevent me from calling it great...but it is nonetheless a ""must-see.""The great tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people in 2006 was one of the greatest disasters of modern times. But as we often do, we tend to forget these things over time...but surely such an event was worthy of remembering via cinema, which is one of our greatest ways of remembering the past...imperfect though those recollections may be. When this great wave hit the coast of Thailand (and many other countries), there was literally no warning. People stood dumbfounded and amazed as an unfathomably huge wall of water wiped everything out of its path. Lives were snuffed out in an instant and dank misery was left everywhere in its wake.THE IMPOSSIBLE tells us just a tiny portion of this epic disaster, as seen through the eyes of one family: Henry, Maria and their 3 young sons (it's based on a true story and a real family). This is a happy, comfortably upper-middle class family that has come to the coast of Thailand over the Christmas holidays. The kids squabble a little bit, but other than this, we see no hint that this isn't a perfect family. We like them immediately during the few minutes we are allowed to get to know them. Then on December 26th, they are playing around their resort pool when suddenly they hear a loud noise. Within seconds, water is bearing down on them...and because they've had just enough time to see that this water can take down entire palm trees with nary a pause...they know they are in trouble. The only thought is to grab the kids and duck.Maria (Naomi Watts) is badly injured in the ensuing flood, and is briefly all alone. She reunites with her oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) and the two of them share wretched travels together before they arrive at a hugely overcrowded and overwhelmed hospital. They believe they are the only survivors of their family.Although the trailers of the film give away much more, I hesitate to do so just in case you haven't seen them. The plot developments are very important, of course, and JA Bayona keeps the tension high. He's best known to US audiences for this Spanish ghost story THE ORPHANAGE, and he does know the value of restraint. This film is actually, remarkably, PG-13...which means much is left to the imagination. We see little gore and death (compared to what our jaded sensibilities are accustomed to), but we HEAR enough to fill in the blanks. Bayona realizes we ultimately care more about this family than we do the carnage, and he keeps his camera tight on them as they react to the horror around them. (This is not to say the movie is ""suitable"" for kids...but I think teens and above SHOULD see this film. It's an important piece of modern history that deserves a respectful look.)Three great things about this film. First, the special effects are truly special. We get huge shots of roiling waters and debris, with Watts and Hooper tossed about like tiny corks. HOW this was accomplished is beyond my understanding, but it is completely and utterly convincing. While we've certainly seen more ""spectacular"" destruction on films like 2112...this is the best ""realistic-scale"" mass destruction I've ever seen. The you-are-there feeling is pretty darn intense at times.Second, the attention to little details of design is great. The hospital in Thailand, for example, has a floor simply awash in fluids of the victims. The grime everywhere feels very real and icky. You understand immediately how a disaster could turn a modern, well-run hospital into a cesspool of infection and disease. (As so often happens, many survivors of the initial assault will succumb to the horrible conditions of their care.)Finally, the performances are first-rate. Ewan McGregor is a master of playing the nice guy, and we've seen this from him many times before. But he's got a couple of scenes where he nearly breaks down with emotion, and thus we're reminded that this guy has got serious, broad acting chops. Young Tom Holland is really special in his role...smart, scared, funny, fierce and fragile. And this works all the better, because most of his scenes are with the remarkable Naomi Watts. She gives one of the most PHYSICALLY powerful performances I've seen in ages, and certainly one of her best performances. It is through her that we feel the physical toll of this event. She gives a huge performance, but it never feels over-the-top. I've always been a fan of Watts, but we haven't seen much of her in recent years. Boy, is she back!There is plenty to take issue with as well. I know this is a true story...but I suspect as with all ""true"" stories, some liberties have been taken with the details. A few plot developments, especially near the end, have too much of a Hollywood manipulation feel to them. As though it was felt even more tension was needed, it felt like events may have been embellished. And the point of focus for this story is certainly up for debate. Is picking a lovely, affluent white couple and following them, to the almost complete exclusion of the citizens of Thailand (who surely suffered greater loss) the best way to tell this story? Certainly, it's a compelling story, but since there won't be 20 different movies about the tsunami, but perhaps only this one (yes, I know there was a TV movie that no one saw), there is a danger that history will remember this event inaccurately. THE IMPOSSIBLE is yet another example of a primarily ""non-white"" event seen through the eyes of white characters.That being said, I believe THE IMPOSSIBLE should be seen. While it isn't exactly a pleasant time at the movies, it is a well-crafted, well-acted and gripping time.",5,4.5 stars.

1623023,A2WPAUTK46SQ31,B00B74MJOS,Steven Johnson,"[0, 0]","Disaster movies usually have a two-pronged challenge: to make a believable film, and to make an effective film. The surprisingly good The Impossible achieves both, through amazingly realistic sets and special effects and through the intense family drama of the narrative.It recounts the true story of a Spanish family of tourists in Thailand for Christmas 2004, right as the devastating tsunami that affected thousands hit the shores. These scenes, which actually hit pretty early on the film, are very frightening and come about as close as I can possibly imagine the true experience of living through a tragedy like that could be. The sheer force of water plunging characters below, paired with the pounding sound design (with one character momentarily deafened) contribute to the sense of horror that these characters, and real people, had to face.In addition to the sheer technical feat of successfully recreating such a massive and devastating event, The Impossible succeeds by telling the story of a disaster so well. Like with other mass tragedies, such as the Holocaust, the bombing of Hiroshima, and many others, it is nearly impossible for any of us to fathom the loss and devastation behind the staggering numbers of fatalities. The Impossible doesn't try to do that. It follows in the tradition of other great disaster movies by focusing on a handful of people, in this instance a family, making the tragedy something we can relate to and empathize with.This is also where the movie gets its strong suit. Sure, it's about the tsunami and the devastating effect it has on Asia, but the disaster is over 30 minutes into the film. The bulk of it, and the emotional punch of this film, is how this family and those affected in a broader sense, deal with this catastrophe. The Impossible is, at its core, a testament to the ability of a family to maintain hope and love in the most dire of circumstances. It is a less hyperbolic version of Poltergeist (a movie which I frankly don't like), to test the love of a family against true, devastating events.We get great performances all around, especially from Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor, and fresh face Tom Holland as the family's eldest son. The Impossible is definitely one of the better movies of 2012 and serves as a nice spiritual companion to Beasts of the Southern Wild as a film about disaster and how the human spirit maintains strength even when facing the most dire of circumstances.",4,Very powerful disaster movie,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,2447,"['Disaster', 'movies', 'usually', 'have', 'two-pronged', 'challenge', 'make', 'believable', 'film', 'make', 'effective', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Impossible', 'achieves', 'amazingly', 'realistic', 'sets', 'special', 'effects', 'intense', 'family', 'drama', 'narrative.It', 'true', 'story', 'Spanish', 'family', 'tourists', 'Thailand', 'Christmas', '2004', 'right', 'devastating', 'tsunami', 'affected', 'thousands', 'hit', 'shores', 'scenes', 'actually', 'hit', 'pretty', 'early', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'frightening', 'come', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'true', 'experience', 'living', 'tragedy', 'could', 'be', 'sheer', 'force', 'water', 'plunging', 'characters', 'paired', 'pounding', 'sound', 'design', 'one', 'character', 'momentarily', 'deafened', 'contribute', 'sense', 'horror', 'characters', 'real', 'people', 'had', 'face.In', 'addition', 'sheer', 'technical', 'feat', 'successfully', 'recreating', 'such', 'massive', 'devastating', 'event', 'Impossible', 'telling', 'story', 'disaster', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'mass', 'tragedies', 'such', 'Holocaust', 'bombing', 'Hiroshima', 'many', 'others', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'fathom', 'loss', 'devastation', 'staggering', 'numbers', 'fatalities', 'Impossible', ""n't"", 'try', 'do', 'tradition', 'other', 'great', 'disaster', 'movies', 'focusing', 'handful', 'people', 'instance', 'family', 'making', 'tragedy', 'something', 'can', 'relate', 'empathize', 'with.This', 'also', 'where', 'movie', 'strong', 'suit', 'Sure', 'tsunami', 'devastating', 'effect', 'Asia', 'disaster', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'bulk', 'emotional', 'punch', 'film', 'how', 'family', 'affected', 'broader', 'sense', 'deal', 'catastrophe', 'Impossible', 'core', 'testament', 'ability', 'family', 'maintain', 'hope', 'love', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'less', 'hyperbolic', 'version', 'Poltergeist', 'movie', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'test', 'love', 'family', 'true', 'devastating', 'events.We', 'get', 'great', 'performances', 'around', 'especially', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'fresh', 'face', 'Tom', 'Holland', 'family', 'eldest', 'son', 'Impossible', 'definitely', 'one', 'better', 'movies', '2012', 'nice', 'spiritual', 'companion', 'Beasts', 'Southern', 'Wild', 'film', 'disaster', 'how', 'human', 'spirit', 'strength', 'even', 'when', 'facing', 'most', 'dire', 'circumstances']",Impossible

What is more interesting about this Spanish film (yes, it is, though shot in English) is that ""The Impossible"" (""Lo imposible"") is the sophomore work from director Juan Antonio Bayona known for his supernatural thriller ""The Orphanage.""Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor are Maria and Henry Bennett on Christmas vacation in Thailand with three sons Lucas, Thomas and Simon. When the tsunami hits the coast where their hotel is, the Bennett family is separated from one another.Acting is all first-rate. Naomi Watts is impressive (as always) as a mother strong and vulnerable, but the real star is Tom Holland as Lucas, whose spiritual transformation is convincing. The special effects of the tidal waves are amazing and terrifying, much more so than that of Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter,"" in showing how debris in the muddy water can hurt your body.""The Impossible"" lets you know what to expect from the film's simple story pretty early on. Will the Bennett family (based on the Bel&oacute;n &Aacute;lvarez family) meet each other again? We know the answer, but the film manages to be suspenseful until a certain scene where things look too good to be true.

No one blinks an eye - even the natives think the life of one white woman is more precious than five of their own people.This thought came to me while I watched ""The Impossible"", the true story of a group of tourists who survived the aftermath of the 2004 Thailand tsunami. In real-life, the woman portrayed by Noami Watts was dark-haired and Hispanic, as was her husband. The cynic in me imagines a bunch of Hollywood producers saying, ""Nobody cares if a bunch of dark-skinned Thais or a Hispanic family suffers in a tsunami - no, make the heroes into white, photogenic Australians and you've got yourself a hit.""Now, I'm not saying the suffering of good-looking white Australians isn't important, but ""the Impossible"" is so generic, so bland in its storytelling, that I'm forced to notice the predictable casting of the overly familiar faces of Hollywood veterans Watts and McGregor. Their ""characters"" are simply that of ""innocent white tourists on holiday caught in a disaster in a 3rd world country.""The film is a thrill ride, nothing more.

The tragedy is set in Thailand but it could have been any Asian or African country. The characters begin as privileged tourists in a foreign country and depart the same way. Any possible conflict between First World expectations of hospital care and Third World makeshift facilities are avoided. Except for blood and gore, the film has nothing to say.The only lessons seem to be: be very lucky, avoid future Thailand vacations, and be more observant when you're at the beach.

But I guess Hollywood didn't think we'd get so invested in a dark-skinned family? No, we are treated to Naomi Watts, nudie shots and all. And before she's given an award for acting, I think they need to recognize she didn't need to act. Her part was convincing due to the special effects/make-up.Also, I was quite offended by the neglect to portray the natives accurately in this tragedy at all.

Overall though, it's a well made, superbly acted film. I thought the pacing was nice. Many people complain about it becoming slow, but after that first 45 minutes, slow is what was needed to give the audience some time to breath. This isnt a Michael Bay action film.About it being ""racist"", I disagree. Why was the movie not about a Thai family and their struggles? Because the studio needs to sell it to the ""Western Market"" so that means making the target audience relate to the cast. Also, making the family foreigners adds more to their struggle because of the language barrier and not knowing the area. If the movie was made for the Eastern Market, then Thai/Asian's would be cast. Im sure a movie with native people of Thai would have been just as heart wrenching, if not more so. But movies with subtitles dont sell as well in the western market. The studio wants to make a profit when they invest tens of millions into a production. Put skin color aside and just realize this is a movie about ""a family"".
