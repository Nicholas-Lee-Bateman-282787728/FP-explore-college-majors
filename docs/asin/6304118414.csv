""Fall"" and ""After Fall, Winter"" are the second and third movies.  I purchased all three movies at the same time, having only seen ""After Fall Winter"" at the time of the purchase.  After watching all three it was immediately apparent there is basically no connection between the first movie and the other two films except the NYC location/connection, the fact all three movies are about fantasy relationships, the subject of suicide is mentioned or is the focus in the plot, and Eric Schaeffer wrote, directed, and starred in all three.  I guess that could make the three films a trilogy but to me the Lucy movie seemed to be writing practice for the other two, each of which is more deeply intimate, brilliantly intelligent, and significantly darker.  ""Fall"" and ""After Fall, Winter"" are connected both by the main character and the story line.  There is no such connection to ""If Lucy Fell.""""If Lucy Fell"" is a light, predictable relationship movie with quirky characters whose thoughts about relationships are rather superficial.  My wife, who is a big ""rom com,"" fan did not find the movie funny at all.  She appreciated it for the light treatment of relationships and the kids in the film, but knew within minutes how it would end.  She even said so out loud. Once she reframed her expectations though she enjoyed the film.  I fell asleep and had to watch the missed parts later.If you want a light relationship film with a bit of quirkiness, get ""If Lucy Fell.""

But with fare this bad, and with HD channels comparatively few, I'm seriously considering returning to the old 20"" GE--either that or order one of the pay services like BET Jazz.This film is so sophomoric, from conception to script to realization, that either the filmmakers are cinematic ignoramuses or colossal cynics, serving up anything intelligible to the lowest forms of humanity.  The writing, especially the dialog, is on the level of the most obvious sit-coms minus the laugh track--a regression by light years from any 30-minute Norman Lear production. There are even more close-ups than you're likely to see in a made-for-TV counterpart. About the only thing that distinguishes this turkey as a theatrical release is the explicit crudeness of the language (which doesn't begin to approach Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor or ""The Aristocrats""--this film can't even make talking dirty much fun).The two male leads are cast in the roles of archetypal, short-guy losers who still make out.  But clearly neither they nor their writers have seen a Woody Allen film or, for that matter, Chaplin, Keaton, or the Marx Brothers. Maybe not even Steve Martin. Ben Stiller walks around like a clueless guest at a Halloween costume party trying to get noticed with a whoopee cushion.At least the two women do justice by my Sony picture, permitting me to turn off the sound and improvise my own script inspired by the possibilities of the intelligence lurking beneath faces that, while expressive, leave you wondering about what--and why.",2,Highly-defined stupidity,1207526400,"04 7, 2008",2008,1678,"['acquiring', 'Sony', 'HD', 'TV', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'bad', 'movies', 'better', 'reason', 'novelty', 'seeing', 'images', 'high', 'definition', 'fare', 'bad', 'HD', 'channels', 'comparatively', 'few', ""'m"", 'seriously', 'considering', 'returning', 'old', '20', 'GE', 'order', 'one', 'pay', 'services', 'BET', 'Jazz.This', 'film', 'so', 'sophomoric', 'conception', 'script', 'realization', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'cinematic', 'ignoramuses', 'colossal', 'cynics', 'serving', 'up', 'anything', 'intelligible', 'lowest', 'forms', 'humanity', 'writing', 'especially', 'dialog', 'level', 'most', 'obvious', 'sit-coms', 'laugh', 'track', 'regression', 'light', 'years', '30-minute', 'Norman', 'Lear', 'production', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'close-ups', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'made-for-TV', 'counterpart', 'only', 'thing', 'turkey', 'theatrical', 'release', 'explicit', 'crudeness', 'language', ""n't"", 'begin', 'approach', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Aristocrats', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'talking', 'dirty', 'much', 'fun', '.The', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'are', 'cast', 'roles', 'archetypal', 'short-guy', 'losers', 'who', 'still', 'make', 'out', 'clearly', 'writers', 'have', 'seen', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'film', 'matter', 'Chaplin', 'Keaton', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'Maybe', 'not', 'even', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'walks', 'clueless', 'guest', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'party', 'trying', 'get', 'noticed', 'whoopee', 'cushion.At', 'least', 'two', 'women', 'do', 'justice', 'Sony', 'picture', 'permitting', 'turn', 'off', 'sound', 'improvise', 'own', 'script', 'inspired', 'possibilities', 'intelligence', 'lurking', 'beneath', 'expressive', 'leave', 'wondering', 'what', 'why']",N/A

But that's all the film has -- a series of disconnected moments, some funny, some just odd -- all lacking in any real cohesiveness.The relationship between Sarah Jessica Parker and Eric Schaeffer's characters is marked by a cold sterility. They are completely without chemistry.

In addition, Schaeffer himself is gross and unappealing. We are almost embarassed to watch him desecrate his own attempt at a character.The story's culmination -- the realization of these friends' romantic feelings for one another -- is ridiculous and unearned. The revelation comes out of nowhere, both figuratively and literally. The film's most glaring example of poor writing occurs in a scene where Sarah Jessica Parker's Lucy engages in a monologue -- the movie's only monologue -- in which she suddenly and quite randomly comes to the conclusion that she has always been in love with Schaeffer's character. This event is not influenced by the film's other events, as it would be in any tightly constructed narrative, but materializes out of thin air.The result is an audience left feeling bored and confused.This is a movie w/ great comedic potential.
