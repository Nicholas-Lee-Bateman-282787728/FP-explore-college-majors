This movie is about misunderstanding between husband and wife, which is cause by other individual plant seeds of doubt in the ears of a loving wife, about her husband relationship with his secretary.Of course, nothing is going on between the business man and his secretary, but the wife believe something must be going on, base on what she is told, the poor husband can't figure out what is wrong with his marriage, because he has done nothing wrong.In this movie you got three of the greatest actors and actresses of all time, Myrna Loy, Clark Gable and Jean Harlow.Ms. Loy wore some of the greatest gowns ever worn by any actresses in any movie, and she look stunning as always in them, and sexy as ever. Ms. Harlow is equally stunning and sexy, and Gable played one of his best roles ever in a movie, of course ""Gone with the Wind"" is his best role, but this is close second or third, (in my book).Ms. Myrna Loy performance was so good, I don't know why she was not nominated for an award.

You've never shown me anything else."" -- LindaA Cosmopolitan Magazine story by Faith Baldwin was purchased by MGM and fashioned for a great trio of big stars by Norman Krasna, John Lee Mahin, and Alice Duer Miller. Director Clarence Brown was given all the gloss and star power that could be finagled. The results were warm and romantic, a film with fun and a message urging viewers to just believe in someone and enjoy love, adding depth to what could have been just enjoyable fluff.V.S. (Clark Gable) and Linda (Myrna Loy) are a couple happily and playfully in love, enjoying to the full all the wonderful pleasures of being married and truly in love. Loy is magnificent here, and so adorable that you get a real sense of how special she was as a star and actress. This is also one of Gable's most likable characters, and performances. He's fun to watch, and so is she, their playful joy as a couple making the film bright, as if someone threw a big dose of sunshine at the screen. They imbue the film with energy and love so warm and fun it must have nearly spilled into moviegoers' laps with the popcorn when it was released.Equally warm and fun is Van's relationship with his wonderful secretary, Whitey Wilson (Jean Harlow). She's smart and spectacular, and his right arm. It is this close relationship Linda's mother-in-law (May Robson) worries about, planting seeds of doubt in a garden hitherto barren of weeds, only bearing sweet fruits. When V.S. must keep secret a sweet deal to take over a magazine, and spend even more time with Whitey, finally ending up in exotic Havana with her rather than his wife, those weeds begin to choke out the roots of Linda's love, breaking her heart. Whitey has her own problems, however, her beau Dave (James Stewart) wanting her to quit her job and something important to her self-worth before they marry.Harlow gets to be Harlow here, a nice girl who just happens to be a knockout; a character much closer to her own personality than others she played onscreen. Humor and warmth blend with romance in this enjoyable film, the absence of a ""bad girl"" within the triangle refreshing. Whitey is indeed anything but a problem, but might not have the will to resist the boss she adores and take him on the rebound if the hurt Linda doesn't realize she's made a big mistake of trust. It is Whitey who will make the most loving gesture in fact, sacrificing what might be for herself, for a happiness much greater between two people who truly can't be happy without the other. Jean Harlow is a good girl here, and it fits like a glove.A rare and wonderful tone and a gorgeous cast all make this story a pleasure to watch. A must see classic for fans of any or all of these stars. Great fun.",5,"""A husband!

302336,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302224411,Byron Kolln,"[22, 22]","WIFE VS. SECRETARY (directed in 1936 by Clarence Brown) is a brisk programmer starring three of MGM's best of the period: Clark Gable, Myrna Loy and Jean Harlow.  It was based on a story by Faith Baldwin which originally appeared in Cosmopolitan Magazine.Van Stanhope (Clark Gable) is a successful publishing tycoon whose marriage with lovely wife Linda (Myrna Loy) is put to the test when rumours about an affair with Van's secretary 'Whitey' (Jean Harlow) start to circulate.  At first, Linda dismisses it as gossip, but later comes to the conclusion it must be true, following a whirlwind business trip to Havana...Jean Harlow is the one who'll really surprise you in this movie.  In a performance worlds away from the zingy dames she played in ""Dinner at Eight"" and ""Red Dust"", Harlow is incredibly naturalistic with her character of 'Whitey', Van's efficient, no-nonsense secretary.  Observe closely her scenes with Clark Gable (especially during the Havana sequence) and her final scene with Myrna Loy.  Very rarely did Harlow convey so much by doing so little on the screen.Gable and Loy conjure up a very healthy screen chemistry.  WIFE VS. SECRETARY also features an early performance from James Stewart, playing Harlow's lanky boyfriend.  The supporting cast includes May Robson, George Barbier and Hobart Cavenaugh.The DVD also includes the 'Crime Does Not Pay' short ""The Public Pays"" (which recycled the sets used in WIFE VS. SECRETARY), musical short ""New Shoes"", and the trailer.

I can empathize because I work in an office that is majority woman.  My wife also works in a different office at my company and sometimes there's some splaining to do when I'm caught communicating with a co-worker.

302339,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6302224411,Douglas M,"[1, 7]","MGM, the Tiffany of studios in Hollywood's heyday, specialised in star power.  ""Wife versus Secretary"" is a good example of that power. In this one, the star trio overcome a dreary woman's magazine story of a business magnate, Clark Gable, married to the perfect wife, Myrna Loy, and the attractive secretary, Jean Harlow, who forms the third side of the triangle which never quite eventuates. This is MGM after the implementation of the Hays Code in 1934 and the film is pompous, superficial and glamorous. Gable overacts but his rapport with his 2 leading ladies is what makes the film bearable. MGM was attempting to move Harlow away from her sleazy pre-code image and her marcelled hair, which is no longer platinum, looks like it is glued to her skull. Her attempts at sincerity are strained and she is no-one's idea of the perfect secretary, not with the evening gown she wears and the swagger with which she walks. James Stewart, at the start of his long career, has a small part as her boyfriend. The best part of the yarn is the innuendo generated in Loy's mind by the circumstantial evidence and the sly cracks of her friends.  There is also a very good isolated scene when her mother-in-law, the indispensible May Robson, gives her some sage advice.The print of the film is poor with numerous scratches, dirt and popping. There are some extras. The original trailer is included as well as a tiresome musical short starring Arthur Lake of Blondie fame and and an Oscar Winning Short in the ""Crime doesn't Pay"" series. The film is lousy value, especially as the print is so poor, but it can be purchased as part of the Clark Gable Signature Collection at a reduced price.",2,Typical MGM opus and a poor print,1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,1680,"['MGM', 'Tiffany', 'studios', 'Hollywood', 'heyday', 'specialised', 'star', 'power', 'Wife', 'versus', 'Secretary', 'good', 'example', 'power', 'one', 'star', 'trio', 'overcome', 'dreary', 'woman', 'magazine', 'story', 'business', 'magnate', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'married', 'perfect', 'wife', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'attractive', 'secretary', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'who', 'third', 'side', 'triangle', 'never', 'quite', 'MGM', 'implementation', 'Hays', 'Code', '1934', 'film', 'pompous', 'superficial', 'glamorous', 'Gable', 'overacts', 'rapport', '2', 'leading', 'ladies', 'what', 'film', 'bearable', 'MGM', 'was', 'attempting', 'move', 'Harlow', 'away', 'sleazy', 'pre-code', 'image', 'marcelled', 'hair', 'longer', 'platinum', 'glued', 'skull', 'attempts', 'sincerity', 'are', 'strained', 'no-one', 'idea', 'perfect', 'secretary', 'not', 'evening', 'gown', 'swagger', 'James', 'Stewart', 'start', 'long', 'career', 'small', 'part', 'boyfriend', 'best', 'part', 'yarn', 'innuendo', 'generated', 'Loy', 'mind', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'sly', 'cracks', 'friends', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'isolated', 'scene', 'when', 'mother-in-law', 'indispensible', 'May', 'Robson', 'sage', 'advice.The', 'print', 'film', 'poor', 'numerous', 'scratches', 'dirt', 'popping', 'are', 'extras', 'original', 'trailer', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'tiresome', 'musical', 'short', 'starring', 'Arthur', 'Lake', 'Blondie', 'fame', 'Oscar', 'Winning', 'Short', 'Crime', ""n't"", 'Pay', 'series', 'film', 'lousy', 'value', 'especially', 'print', 'so', 'poor', 'can', 'be', 'purchased', 'part', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Signature', 'Collection', 'reduced', 'price']",N/A
302340,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6302224411,Dr. James Gardner,"[2, 2]","""Wife vs. Secretary"" is a mid 30s romantic comedy that isn't all that romantic and certainly not that funny, but what it does have is 3 of the top stars of the era - Gable, Harlow and Loy - in terrific performances. And just to put the cherry on the cake, we have a very young Jimmy Stewart in one of his first roles.This must have seemed like a party to the 3 stars. Gable and Harlow made 6 films together and Loy and Gable made 7 films together. Harlow and Loy appeared together in ""Libeled Lady"" (1936) with William Powell and Spencer Tracy. Gable and Harlow were BFFsJean Harlow (1911-1937) was the biggest sex symbol of her times. She gained her reputation playing the gangster's moll in films like ""Hell's Angels"" (1930), ""The Secret Six"" (1931), and ""Public Enemy"" (1931). In 1932 alone she made 5 films, including ""Red Headed Woman"", ""Scarface"" and ""Beast of the City,"" and she co-starred with Clark Gable in ""Red Dust"". By 1936 she had secured her position as a comedienne, largely as a result of ""Bombshell"" (1933). In ""Wife vs. Secretary"" she really makes another transition - into a full fledged actress, capable of playing any role.Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. We remember him best as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other nomination was for 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and he won in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night""), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like ""Teachers' Pet"" (1958) and ""But Not for Me"" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958).  BTW - it was Gable's appearance with Harlow in ""Red Dust"" that moved him from the ranks to the top list.Myrna Loy (1905-93) is best remembered as Nora Charles from ""The Thin Man"" series that produced 6 films between 1934 and 1947. She made more than 100 films, the most notable of which are ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"" (1948) and ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" (1950).This was Jimmy Stewart's (1908-97) fourth film, He needs little introduction. He ranks #3 on the AFI list of greatest male stars. He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times, winning for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940), although he's probably better known for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946). He made nearly 100 films between 1934 and 1991, and was equally at home in westerns (""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance""), comedies (""The Shop Around the Corner""), and drama (""Rear Window"").Also in the cast are May Robson and John Qualen.May Robson (1858-1942) was everyone's favorite granny, a part she played in films like ""Irene"" (1940), ""They Made Me a Criminal"" (1939), and ""A Star is Born"" (1937). She was nominated for an Oscar for ""Lady for a Day"" (1934).  She plays Gable's mother.John Qualen (1899-1987) is best known as part of the Wayne/Ford stock company. He made nearly 200 films, 9 of them directed by John Ford and 4 with Wayne but not Ford - ""Shepherd of the Hills"", ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), and ""North to Alaska (1960) and ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963). My favorite John Qualen role was as Lars in ""The Searchers"" (1956). Qualen has a small role as an accountant. He doesn't use his customary European accent.Clarence Brown (1890-1987) directs. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Flesh and the Devil""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director. He loved working with actresses, and worked with both Greta Garbo  and  Joan Crawford 6 times.Brown was also a producer and made 28 films, including this one. Other Brown films were ""Anna Christie"" (1930), ""The Human Comedy"" (1943) and ""Angels in the Outfield"" (1951).Herbert Stothart (1885-1949) was the composer and often worked with Brown. Stothart won the Oscar for ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) and was nominated 9 more times. He was often used in period pieces, and his films include ""Treasure Island"" (1934), Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), Anna Karenina"" (1935), ""Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), and ""Romeo and Juliette"" (1936).The plot is no great shakes and the film would only be a so-so film in the hands of anyone else. But Brown manages to get bravura performances from everyone. There are a few scenes in which silent looks between Gable and Harlow (in their hotel room in Havana) and between Loy and Harlow (in Gable's office) are so expressive that they rank up there with the very best scenes in any film.Most people interpret this film as a conflict between Loy (wife) and Harlow (secretary), and while this is true, on another level this is also a film about Harlow's choice to remain as Gable's secretary or to quit and become Jimmy Stewart's wife.In 1936 Jean Harlow had 3 films in the top 20 - ""Libeled Lady"" ( Spencer Tracy, William Powell, and Myrna Loy), ""Wife vs. Secretary"" (Gable and Loy),  and ""Suzy"" (Cary Grant). The other big money winners were ""San Francisco"" (Gable), ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Powell and Loy), ""Modern Times"" (Chaplin), and ""Charge of the Light Brigade"" (Flynn and de Havilland). The big Oscar winner was ""The Great Ziegfeld"" (Picture, Best Actress). Other notable films from that year were ""The Petrified Forest"" (Bogart), ""Romeo and Juliette"" (Shearer and Howard), ""Dodsworth"" (Walter Huston) and Fritz Lang's ""Fury"".If you're a Harlow fan, you need to watch this film. In fact, fans of Gable, Loy, or Stewart will also find their performances exceptional and enjoy this film. As a 30s romantic comedy it is pretty straight forward, but by the time Brown and his 4 stars get finished with it, it's elevated to a must see.",5,Harlow at her very best as an actress,1300924800,"03

Clarence Brown, 1936, 88 minutes) is a wonderful Clark Gable vehicle and not a bad placement for Myrna Loy as his devoted wife. Gable plays Van, known in the office as ""V.S."", a cheerful, blustery business tycoon. He seems like he ought to be a playboy, but he loves his wife and anything ""smutty"" is unknown to him.Enter his devoted secretary played by a dopey-faced Jean Harlow. While she loves Van, I mean to say, who doesn't?! - she keeps her distance and deeply respects her boss' wife too. Good thing, Harlow, or Loy would have you on the ropes! Aside from this, the secretary has an affiance (a very young Jimmy Stewart) waiting in the wings.This is a sharp, sometimes painful morality tale. The boss and secretary are NOT having an affair nor does it cross their minds, though the secretary does love Van. Everyone else, even Van's haggish old mother, has them doing the baloney pony and it is truly sickening. The two of them, betrayed in a sense because they like each other and want to work together, make a powerful feminist stance. Why can't a secretary stand by her boss? Why does a boss have to give up a fine mind just because of other people's talk?Gable gives a natural, 21st century performance here, as he was always wont to do. He is as big and likeable as we always knew he really was. Myrna Loy keeps her silly faux-nobility attitude in check here, due to extreme youth I think, while Jean Harlow is typical. Don't get me wrong, it's just that I never, ever liked Harlow at all. Here she is quite decent and tolerable.You cannot understand cinematic or social history unless you see this movie. It is so much more than just a cautionary tale about two innocent people being accused of having an affair, and the lecture Harlow gives Loy at the end will actually make you weep a little. Beautiful.A final kiss for Clarence Brown, who directed some of my favorite classics such as Anna Karenina ('35), The Rains Came ('39), Edison the Man ('40 all-time classic with Spencer Tracy), National Velvet and The Yearling.

Well that it's not really the case here because ""Wife vs Secretary"" is neither dumb or superficial, besides James Stewart wasn't a known actor at the time. As the title obviously suggests it's about a man who has a very appealing secretary thus setting a scenario for a confrontation with his wife. But here is where 'Wife Vs Secretary"" differs from the cliche. Because neither is Loy (the wife) the jealous type, Gable (the husband) a Casanova, or Harlow (the secretary) a dumb sexy home wrecking type. The confrontations occur out of the scenarios that these three characters are put in and the gossip that people spread around them. And i like that for a change we are shown that sometimes problems are just the schemes of our own fears and insecurities and even though people always try to push you to see the world how they want, you have to realize life is simpler than that.

Clark Gable is a wealthy, hard working magazine publisher happily married to Myrna Loy; Jean Harlow, his secretary is an eminently respectable young woman and engaged to lowly office worker James Stewart, but her all too obvious attractiveness leads some of Gable and Loy's high society associates, to believe that their relationship goes beyond the office. After many soap-opera-like plot twists, everyone manages to reach a happy ending. The film is solidly within the 1930's ""women's picture"" genre, and though it's a superior example of the form, few viewers today are likely to find its stock situations and predictable plot very engaging. Yet it's not at all a bad film: the 1930's fashions and decor are lovely, and the acting is creditable all around. No advisories; recommended for fans of 1930s films or of the featured stars.

302348,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6302224411,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 6]","""Wife Versus Secretary"" poses the simple question.  If Clark Gable was married to Myrna Loy, would he be tempted by his secretary if she was Jean Harlow?  This would not be a hard choice for me because I cannot name a blonde in the 1930s who for my money was sexier than Myrna Loy, but I acknowledge this to be a minority opinion.  Besides, Harlow gets higher billing than Loy in this film.  Gable plays Van Sanford, a young publisher who has been married to Linda for three years.  Whitey Wilson (Harlow) is Van's attractive secretary, who is sort of engaged to young Tom (Billy Newell).  Linda tries very hard not to be jealous, but other people are talking about, in an interesting semi-feminist angle, she wonders why Dan did not promote Whitey when he had an opportunity.  Then we have one of those ""innocent"" circumstances that really sets things in motion when Dan flies off to Havana for a secret meeting with another publisher.  Whitey has to fly off to join him and help close the deal, but, of course, Linda calls, Whitey answers the phone, and suddenly Dan is on his way to a divorce.This 1936 film from director Clarence Brown is like a lot of films from this period: a cliche-riddled plot with a pretty good cast.  Most surprisingly, Gable has relatively little to do is this film.  He spends more time playing the businessman than the husband, which gives the film squarely to Harlow and Loy.  Harlow does a nice job of playing the secretary, totally competent and not at all interested in her boss.  But Loy  has to carry the film as Linda tries to remain dignified as her doubts assail her.  The big scene in ""Wife Versus Secretary"" actually ends up being between Loy and Harlow, which is actually as it should be.  May Robson has a nice supporting role as Van's mother as does Jimmy Stewart as Dave.  The star power is at the ""A"" level while the script by Norman Krasna, Alice Duer Miller and John Lee Mahin, based on the novel by Faith Baldwin, grades out as at a ""C,"" which is why the above ranking splits the difference.",4,Wife Myrna Loy is worried about Secretary Jean Harlow,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,2041,"['Wife', 'Versus', 'Secretary', 'simple', 'question', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'was', 'married', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'would', 'be', 'tempted', 'secretary', 'was', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'hard', 'choice', 'can', 'not', 'name', 'blonde', '1930s', 'who', 'money', 'was', 'sexier', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'acknowledge', 'be', 'minority', 'opinion', 'Harlow', 'higher', 'billing', 'Loy', 'film', 'Gable', 'plays', 'Van', 'Sanford', 'young', 'publisher', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'Linda', 'three', 'years', 'Whitey', 'Wilson', 'Harlow', 'Van', 'attractive', 'secretary', 'who', 'sort', 'engaged', 'young', 'Tom', 'Billy', 'Newell', 'Linda', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'be', 'jealous', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'talking', 'interesting', 'semi-feminist', 'angle', 'why', 'Dan', 'did', 'not', 'promote', 'Whitey', 'when', 'had', 'opportunity', 'Then', 'have', 'one', 'innocent', 'circumstances', 'really', 'things', 'motion', 'when', 'Dan', 'Havana', 'secret', 'meeting', 'publisher', 'Whitey', 'fly', 'off', 'join', 'help', 'close', 'deal', 'course', 'Linda', 'Whitey', 'phone', 'suddenly', 'Dan', 'way', 'divorce.This', '1936', 'film', 'director', 'Clarence', 'Brown', 'lot', 'films', 'period', 'cliche-riddled', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'Most', 'surprisingly', 'Gable', 'relatively', 'little', 'do', 'film', 'more', 'time', 'playing', 'businessman', 'husband', 'film', 'squarely', 'Harlow', 'Loy', 'Harlow', 'nice', 'job', 'playing', 'secretary', 'totally', 'competent', 'not', 'interested', 'boss', 'Loy', 'carry', 'film', 'Linda', 'remain', 'dignified', 'doubts', 'big', 'scene', 'Wife', 'Versus', 'Secretary', 'actually', 'up', 'being', 'Loy', 'Harlow', 'actually', 'should', 'be', 'May', 'Robson', 'nice', 'supporting', 'role', 'Van', 'mother', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Dave', 'star', 'power', 'A', 'level', 'script', 'Norman', 'Krasna', 'Alice', 'Duer', 'Miller', 'John', 'Lee', 'Mahin', 'based', 'novel', 'Faith', 'Baldwin', 'out', 'as', 'C', 'why', 'above', 'ranking', 'difference']",N/A

Then the other night I watched Wife Versus Secretary--Myrna Loy again but this time Clark Gable too, 1936 again too would you believe, what a fine year that was: The great Senor Pynchy himself was born on May 8 of 1936 and I'm only mentioning this here coz I literally just finished his magnificent penultimate novel which clocked in at something massive like 1085 pages and is in my humble opinion stupefyingly well-written and entertaining but in the end really far too short. I could've kept reading this big baggy beautiful book till the cows came home. On the other hand, Rudyard Kipling died in 1936. Sigh. But I'm sorta rambling now on account of I seem to have gotten myself into the horseradish again. Wife Versus Secretary though really is a terrific motion picture, billed erroneously I kinda think as some sort of screwball comedy. It is just that I guess in parts but what you remember most here I think is the sincerity of Harlow's lovely performance--this dignified dame's the full nine yards here and her scene late in the story with Myrna Loy is if you see it right an arresting and irresistible encounter beautifully shot in those devastatingly attractive shades of black and white. Just as soon as I can I'm going to watch Harlow and Gable again in Red Dust (1932), a real sizzler altogether according to several online movie bozos plus it's got the incandescent Mary Astor too so what could possibly go wrong?",5,Harlowlujah,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",2010,2042,"['Not', ""'m"", 'Rick', 'Blaine', 'North', 'Africa', '1942', 'who', 'was', 'misinformed', 'waters', 'anything', 'was', 'somehow', 'hoodwinked', 'entirely', 'considerable', 'length', 'time', 'screen', 'appeal', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'Then', 'last', 'saw', 'Libeled', 'Lady', '1936', 'hee-hawed', 'donkey', 'account', 'how', 'good', 'funny', 'well-acted', 'whole', 'screwy', 'four-hander', 'turned', 'out', 'be', ""'d"", 'heard', 'rather', 'sensational', 'stories', 'told', 'telly', 'elsewhere', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'sure', 'sounded', 'wanted', 'crack', 'everybody', 'most', 'time', 'original', 'Blonde', 'Bombshell', 'accounts', 'saucy', 'overbold', 'Then', 'other', 'night', 'watched', 'Wife', 'Versus', 'Secretary', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'again', 'time', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'too', '1936', 'again', 'too', 'would', 'believe', 'what', 'fine', 'year', 'was', 'great', 'Senor', 'Pynchy', 'was', 'born', 'May', '8', '1936', ""'m"", 'only', 'mentioning', 'here', 'literally', 'just', 'finished', 'magnificent', 'penultimate', 'novel', 'clocked', 'something', 'massive', '1085', 'pages', 'humble', 'opinion', 'stupefyingly', 'well-written', 'entertaining', 'end', 'really', 'far', 'too', 'short', 'could', ""'ve"", 'kept', 'reading', 'big', 'baggy', 'beautiful', 'book', 'cows', 'came', 'home', 'other', 'hand', 'Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'died', '1936', 'Sigh', ""'m"", 'sorta', 'rambling', 'now', 'account', 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'horseradish', 'again', 'Wife', 'Versus', 'Secretary', 'really', 'terrific', 'motion', 'picture', 'billed', 'erroneously', 'kinda', 'think', 'sort', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'just', 'guess', 'parts', 'what', 'remember', 'most', 'here', 'think', 'sincerity', 'Harlow', 'lovely', 'performance', 'dignified', 'dame', 'full', 'nine', 'yards', 'here', 'scene', 'late', 'story', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'see', 'right', 'arresting', 'irresistible', 'encounter', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'devastatingly', 'attractive', 'shades', 'black', 'white', 'Just', 'as', 'soon', 'can', ""'m"", 'going', 'watch', 'Harlow', 'Gable', 'again', 'Red', 'Dust', '1932', 'real', 'sizzler', 'altogether', 'according', 'several', 'online', 'movie', 'bozos', 'got', 'incandescent', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'too', 'so', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong']",N/A

That surprized me because this is a pretty good movie; it has comedy, drama and a nice, meaningful ending.  It also had great acting, writing and directing.  Relatively unknown director Clarence Brown did a nice job right from the beginnig.  In the opening scenes we learn that our main character is wealthy, then we learn he has a special relationship with his wife, then we learn he is popular with his employees and a genius at his work.  Before long we learn that he has a wiz of a secretary as well.  Once the table's been well-set, things begin to interact; all flowing from a careless rermark by our hero's mother.  The circumstancial events feed the seed of jealousy and things reach a crisis.  In the end, it is new-comer Jimmy Stewart who puts everything in focus.  He's part of the able acting quartet that includes Gable, Myrna Loy, and the fireball of loyalty, Jean Harlow.  That cast alone should have keep this movie as a regular on the Late Late Show.

302353,A1XEFHQZP8Y35W,6302224411,Silver Screen,"[6, 6]","""Wife Vs. Secretary"", a little known film from MGM in 1936 is a true gem.  The story is fairly formula stuff, nothing that MGM hadn't tried before in one format or another - - but it's the lead actors that make this diamond sparkle.Clark Gable is Van Stanford, a devoted, loving husband who has been married to his lovely wife Linda (Myrna Loy) for three years, with nary a bump in the road.  All that changes one day when Van's mother (May Robson) makes an innocent comment to Linda about how dependent Van is on his secretary, Whitey (Jean Harlow) and what a lovely girl Whitey is.  Immediately, Linda begins getting suspicious and concerned about Van's ""true"" feelings for Whitey.  The time that Van and Whitey are forced to spend together due to work, and several small situations that are taken out of context, convince Linda that Van is cheating on her with Whitey and she makes plan to divorce Van and sail off for Europe.Will Linda leave?  Will Van let her?  Does Whitey really love Van?All three leads are perfectly charming and playing against type.  Gable plays a loving, sensitive husband - -and very well - - rather than his usual tough guy or bad guy role.  He is very convincing as a devoted businessman - - devoted to both his wife and his job.  He is also surprisingly convincing playing the scenes where he truly does not understand why his wife would think anything untoward was going on with his secretary.Myrna Loy played, in her own words, probably the sexiest wife she had been allowed to play up to this point in her career.  It's obvious that she and Van have a very passionate and sexual relationship.  Additionally, Loy is dressed to the nines in beautiful creations by Dolly Tree.Jean Harlow is perhaps cast the most against type.  As Whitey, she is a serious, work-minded secretary who seems not to realize how pretty or sexual she is.  She dresses in conservative business suits and not a single wisecrack slips from her lips.  Rather than setting her cap on a taken man, as several of her early film characters did, she seems intent on preserving the sanctity of marriage.Look also for James Stewart in one of his early roles, playing Whitey's adoring boyfriend, who doesn't much like sharing her with Van.This is definitely a winner of a movie from Hollywood's Golden Age, starring four of MGM's brightest stars.Highly recommended.",4,"Wife vs. Secretary, or Loy vs. Harlow",1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,2363,"['Wife', 'Vs.', 'Secretary', 'little', 'known', 'film', 'MGM', '1936', 'true', 'gem', 'story', 'fairly', 'formula', 'stuff', 'nothing', 'MGM', 'had', ""n't"", 'tried', 'one', 'format', 'lead', 'actors', 'make', 'diamond', 'sparkle.Clark', 'Gable', 'Van', 'Stanford', 'devoted', 'loving', 'husband', 'who', 'been', 'married', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'three', 'years', 'bump', 'road', 'changes', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'Van', 'mother', 'May', 'Robson', 'innocent', 'comment', 'Linda', 'how', 'dependent', 'Van', 'secretary', 'Whitey', 'Jean', 'Harlow', 'what', 'lovely', 'girl', 'Whitey', 'Immediately', 'Linda', 'getting', 'suspicious', 'concerned', 'Van', 'true', 'feelings', 'Whitey', 'time', 'Van', 'Whitey', 'are', 'forced', 'spend', 'together', 'due', 'work', 'several', 'small', 'situations', 'are', 'taken', 'context', 'convince', 'Linda', 'Van', 'cheating', 'Whitey', 'plan', 'divorce', 'Van', 'sail', 'off', 'Europe.Will', 'Linda', 'leave', 'Will', 'Van', 'let', 'Does', 'Whitey', 'really', 'love', 'Van', 'three', 'leads', 'are', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'playing', 'type', 'Gable', 'loving', 'sensitive', 'husband', '-and', 'very', 'well', 'rather', 'usual', 'tough', 'guy', 'bad', 'guy', 'role', 'very', 'convincing', 'devoted', 'businessman', 'devoted', 'wife', 'job', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'playing', 'scenes', 'where', 'truly', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'wife', 'would', 'think', 'anything', 'untoward', 'was', 'going', 'secretary.Myrna', 'Loy', 'played', 'own', 'words', 'probably', 'sexiest', 'wife', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'play', 'up', 'point', 'career', 'obvious', 'Van', 'have', 'very', 'passionate', 'sexual', 'relationship', 'Additionally', 'Loy', 'dressed', 'nines', 'beautiful', 'creations', 'Dolly', 'Tree.Jean', 'Harlow', 'perhaps', 'cast', 'most', 'type', 'Whitey', 'serious', 'work-minded', 'secretary', 'who', 'not', 'realize', 'how', 'pretty', 'sexual', 'conservative', 'business', 'suits', 'not', 'single', 'wisecrack', 'slips', 'lips', 'Rather', 'setting', 'cap', 'taken', 'man', 'several', 'early', 'film', 'characters', 'did', 'intent', 'preserving', 'sanctity', 'marriage.Look', 'also', 'James', 'Stewart', 'one', 'early', 'roles', 'playing', 'Whitey', 'adoring', 'boyfriend', 'who', ""n't"", 'much', 'sharing', 'Van.This', 'definitely', 'winner', 'movie', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Age', 'starring', 'four', 'MGM', 'brightest', 'stars.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
302354,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6302224411,Simon Davis,"[7, 7]","&quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, could easily from its title be passed off as a fairly ordinary little marital drama. Despite being based on a Faith Baldwin magazine short story this film never seems to stick to the &quot;rules&quot;, of these types of subjects which is what makes it such interesting viewing. Here in the three lead characters are no clearly defined types such as the &quot;homewrecking secretary&quot;, &quot;the injured wife&quot;, and the &quot;cheating husband&quot;. As portrayed by MGM legends Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy and Clark Gable respectively these individuals all possess interesting and at times quite unexpected traits that help raise &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, way above other films with a similiar theme. Jean Harlow in particular is a revelation in her most interesting and surprisingly non traditional role as the secretary who for once is not a calculating man trap. Written in a none sentimental manner by writers Norma Krasna and John Lee Mahin, &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, is unique in that it will appeal to both male and female viewers containing positive elements in both the female and male characters represented.By 1936 Clark Gable was really the King of MGM and Jean Harlow was starting to move away from the sassy, loud talking &quot;dames&quot; she had specialised in earlier in the decade. Here she plays &quot;Whitey&quot; Wilson, the super efficient, totally dedicated secretary to publishing heavy weight Van &quot;V.S.&quot; Stanhope (Clark Gable). For Whitey the job always comes first which often causes ruffles in her relationship with boyfriend Dave (James Stewart). Van has been very happily married for 3 years to the lovely Linda (Myrna Loy) and Van's total trust and reliance on Whitey as his &quot;right handed man&quot;, has never been a problem for Linda. It's only when Van's well meaning mother Mimi (May Robson), who happens to adore Linda like a real daughter, starts to plant seeds of doubt in Linda's mind about Whitey's attractive qualities that tensions begin to mount. Van meanwhile enters into secret plans for a quick takeover of another rival publishing company. It involves lots of extra hours of work which Whitey is always available for but which starts to make Linda feel like she is being left out of things. Hardly seeing her husband Linda invites some guests to the house but when Whitey arrives at the party with some important documents for Van to sign but then finds herself swept into the dancing Linda really begins seeing her as being after her husband. When a trip to Havana that Linda has planned is also called off because of the takeover bid she finds that Van has gone on ahead and then called Whitey to come down to assist with all the paperwork involved. Linda by mistake calls Van's room at the hotel which Whitey innocently answers causing Linda to think the two are involved in an affair. Linda immediately makes the moves to file for divorce and after some initial efforts to prove his innocenece of any wrong doing with Whitey Van grows tired of Linda's lack of trust in his marital fidelity. Linda plans a boat trip to Europe to getaway from Van and at dock side it is surprisingly Whitey who shows up in her cabin and warns Linda that if she goes on the trip she will loose Van and that she will definately then go after her boss romantically. Linda suddenly sees that all along Whitey has been all business despite some very deep seated feelings for Van and that she has unnecessarily been the suspicious wife looking for problems where there aren't any. The conclusion sees a reconciliation is in the wings for Linda and Van and Whitey returns to the arms of her affectionate and always waiting boyfriend Dave.Myrna Loy said in later interviews that this film offered her a splendid chance to portray something other than the usual &quot;perfect wife&quot;, she generally specialised in and she described her character as &quot;having one foot in the bed all the time&quot;. Certainly it is a nice variation on her hugely popular Nora Charles character. As stated previously all three leads play characters with surprising elements here. Clark Gable for once plays a devoted and quite exemplary husband who adores his wife and can't understand her jealousy of secretary Whitey. This I believe is one of his more appealing performances from this mid 1930's period. Jean Harlow is no vamp in this story and is the honest, all business respectable assistant who would never intrude on others marriages. She reveals a growing maturity as an actress in her playing of Whitey which sadly was to be cut short the following year by her early death The power of these three performers makes the material here come alive and great credit must go to director Clarence Brown for not allowing the characters to become wafer thin copies of the three stars already established personas. Being responsible for directing such diverse efforts as &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; with Garbo and &quot;National Velvet&quot;, with Elizabeth Taylor, Brown was an MGM veteran even by 1936 and left his imprint on the performances in all his film. &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;, has a wonderful 1930's look to it and Cedric Gibbons' impressive art deco interior designs, contain some of his most innovative interior design work. Costuming also plays an important role in this production as for almost the first time Jean Harlow is dressed in modest non revealing clothes appropriate to a secretary and Myrna Loy dressed by her favourite designer Dolly Tree wears the more glamourous and revealing outfits as befitting her affleunt wife of the story.MGM was always spot on in their handling of marital soap opera dramas and in &quot;Wife vs. Secretary&quot;,they produced one of their best combining interesting and original characters in a simple story to great box office effect. It never could be seen as being your average tale of infidelity and desire and in the hands of Gable, Harlow and Loy it translates into a very entertaining snapshot of the 1930's upper class and their marital goings on.
