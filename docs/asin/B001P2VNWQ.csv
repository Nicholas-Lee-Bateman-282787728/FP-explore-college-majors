That said, I was surprised by how much I really disliked this workout by 15 minutes in.As others have noted, the weird ""I trust"" catch phrase was annoying from the get-go and increasingly annoying with every repeat.  Also, the moves just seemed rather slow and awkward when actually executing them.  After 30 minutes they were sweating buckets and I had not even broken a sweat nor got my heart rate above 100.  I quit and fast forwarded through the rest just to watch it.  Then changed to another workout DVD to get a good workout.For me, a disappointment.  Perhaps it will work well for beginners working their way up and those who don't mind the catch phrase.",3,i trust i am disappointed,1311897600,"07 29, 2011",2011,821,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.Watching', 'preview', 'clips', 'workout', 'liked', 'overall', 'moves', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'trying', 'said', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'disliked', 'workout', '15', 'minutes', 'in.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'weird', 'trust', 'catch', 'phrase', 'was', 'annoying', 'get-go', 'increasingly', 'annoying', 'repeat', 'Also', 'moves', 'just', 'seemed', 'rather', 'slow', 'awkward', 'when', 'actually', 'executing', '30', 'minutes', 'were', 'sweating', 'buckets', 'had', 'not', 'even', 'broken', 'sweat', 'got', 'heart', 'rate', '100', 'quit', 'fast', 'forwarded', 'rest', 'just', 'watch', 'Then', 'changed', 'workout', 'DVD', 'get', 'good', 'workout.For', 'disappointment', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'work', 'well', 'beginners', 'working', 'way', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'catch', 'phrase']",Kickin' Strength

McHugh,"[5, 5]",I will buy any DVD Amy puts out because she is an excellent instructor and I love that they are broken up into different segments so I feel like I am actually accomplishing something. You will notice a big difference in your core if you stick with Amy's workouts. I am alternating this with Give Me 10 and Total in Ten.

This is a kickboxing workout that will totally bust your booty.  Like in her other workouts, the key to making these work is Amy herself.  She's got a really energetic personality that makes you WANT to work out with her.  And I'll tell you what, by the end, I was spent.  This workout is tough.  So if you're a complete novice, be forewarned.  It's not really for the faint of heart.  But if you want a good kickboxing workout that will make you feel like you actually worked out, you won't do better than this.Point blank, it's just a good, fun workout.  And for me, I need it to be fun.  This definitely was.",5,Amy Dixon does it again.

But I started running and doing her other dvd, give me 10, and decided to give this one a shot again. Now I can finish itI think Amy is a good instructor, not too perky or arrogant, and she explains the moves well. My only complaint is that I wish it had more arm work. My arms aren't nearly as sore after this dvd as they were after a gyn class I used to attend.
