1251912,A2OZBJ58CML9OS,B0026P3HPW,A. Gammill,"[48, 60]","After waiting ten years for a Red Dwarf reunion, hearing rumours of another series or even a big-screen movie, fans' anticipation level for ""Back to Earth"" was VERY high.  I'm sure I'm not the only fan who, after viewing this 3-part episode, was left wondering if the wait was worth it.(SPOILERS AHEAD)While it is nice to have most of the cast back (including a too-late and too-brief turn by Chloe Annett), the magic that made Red Dwarf such fun is laregly missing.  It starts off promisingly enough, with Lister making Rimmer the butt of another in a series of practical jokes.  But when the main plot kicks in, a sinking feeling of deja vu sets in.  ""Back to Earth"" appropriates the plot from an earlier, better episode, ""Back to Reality.""  I won't give it all away, but if you've seen the earlier episode, the ""twist"" ending of this one won't come as a shock at all.The other, only slightly lesser problem is that very little attempt is made to maintain the series' continuity.  It's been ten years (nine, according to an on-screen message) since the crew was left hanging at the end of ""Only the Good. . ."".  When ""Back to Earth"" begins, Rimmer is inexplicably a hologram again, Kochanski has been written out of the show, and the ship is back in deep space with the 4 lead players in place like nothing has changed.So, you're thinking, this guy's given it 3 stars...is there ANYTHING good about it?  Well, yes.  For starters, everyone looks like they've barely aged, which is just short of miraculous considering the first episode of Red Dwarf aired 21 years ago.  And even though the script gives them little of note to work with, the actors slip back into their roles with ease.  Production values are generally high, although a CGI skutter in place of the old animatronic one will make long-time fans cringe.As a long-time fan, I'd certainly be thrilled if this led to a revival of the series.  I just hope the writers can come up with some fresh and FUNNY ideas, or they should let Red Dwarf rest in peace.",3,"It's good to have the guys back, but. . .",1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,2016,"['waiting', 'ten', 'years', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'reunion', 'hearing', 'rumours', 'series', 'even', 'big-screen', 'movie', 'fans', 'anticipation', 'level', 'Back', 'Earth', 'was', 'VERY', 'high', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'fan', 'who', 'viewing', '3-part', 'episode', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', 'wait', 'was', 'worth', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD', 'nice', 'have', 'most', 'cast', 'back', 'including', 'too-late', 'too-brief', 'turn', 'Chloe', 'Annett', 'magic', 'made', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'such', 'fun', 'laregly', 'missing', 'promisingly', 'enough', 'Lister', 'making', 'Rimmer', 'butt', 'series', 'practical', 'jokes', 'when', 'main', 'plot', 'kicks', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'deja', 'vu', 'sets', 'Back', 'Earth', 'plot', 'earlier', 'better', 'episode', 'Back', 'Reality', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'earlier', 'episode', 'twist', 'ending', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'shock', 'all.The', 'other', 'only', 'slightly', 'lesser', 'problem', 'very', 'little', 'attempt', 'made', 'maintain', 'series', 'continuity', 'been', 'ten', 'years', 'nine', 'according', 'on-screen', 'message', 'crew', 'was', 'left', 'hanging', 'end', 'Only', 'Good', 'When', 'Back', 'Earth', 'begins', 'Rimmer', 'inexplicably', 'hologram', 'again', 'Kochanski', 'been', 'written', 'show', 'ship', 'back', 'deep', 'space', '4', 'lead', 'players', 'place', 'nothing', 'changed.So', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'guy', 'given', '3', 'stars', 'there', 'ANYTHING', 'good', 'Well', 'yes', 'starters', 'everyone', 'looks', ""'ve"", 'barely', 'aged', 'just', 'short', 'miraculous', 'considering', 'first', 'episode', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'aired', '21', 'years', 'ago', 'even', 'script', 'little', 'note', 'work', 'actors', 'slip', 'back', 'roles', 'ease', 'Production', 'values', 'are', 'generally', 'high', 'CGI', 'skutter', 'place', 'old', 'animatronic', 'one', 'will', 'make', 'long-time', 'fans', 'cringe.As', 'long-time', 'fan', ""'d"", 'certainly', 'be', 'thrilled', 'led', 'revival', 'series', 'just', 'hope', 'writers', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'fresh', 'FUNNY', 'ideas', 'should', 'let', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'rest', 'peace']",N/A

The surprise? ""Back to Earth"" did not suffer at all by comparison to Series I. As for the continuity issues, I'd already been inoculated against any discombobulation by the glaring ones between the end of Series I and the beginning of Series II, not to mention those between the end of Series VI and the beginning of Series VII. (Yes, these were explained after a fashion, but in a deliberately quick and dirty way that made it quite clear that Grant/Naylor and Naylor were not about to be hamstrung by such things.) ""Back to Earth"" did seem like a scaled-down version of the feature film Naylor had hoped to make, and frankly I was glad to be able to see it play out in TV form. It was able to focus on the heart of the concept, the tragicomic situation of Lister, without it getting lost in a lot of cinematic froo-fraw. And Part Three gives one of Red Dwarf's main inspirations the thorough twitting it's long been asking for. If there's any downside, it's that Rimmer, Cat and Kryten are rather relegated to being Lister's spear carriers. And while an explanation is at hand for this--and proves to be the key to the whole business--the story does have Lister do something singularly shocking. (Maybe two somethings, depending on how you feel about what Lister also does to Rimmer--I mean, how much punishment does one incorrigibly smegheaded hard-light hologram deserve?)",4,Comparison,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,1583,"['Had', 'just', 'received', 'boxed', 'set', 'complete', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'series', 'I-VIII', 'watched', 'first', 'series', 'probably', 'eleventeenth', 'time', 'when', 'decided', 'check', 'out', 'Back', 'Earth', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'surprise', 'Back', 'Earth', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'comparison', 'Series', 'continuity', 'issues', ""'d"", 'already', 'been', 'inoculated', 'discombobulation', 'glaring', 'ones', 'end', 'Series', 'beginning', 'Series', 'II', 'not', 'mention', 'end', 'Series', 'VI', 'beginning', 'Series', 'VII', 'Yes', 'were', 'explained', 'fashion', 'deliberately', 'quick', 'dirty', 'way', 'made', 'quite', 'clear', 'Grant/Naylor', 'Naylor', 'were', 'not', 'be', 'hamstrung', 'such', 'things', 'Back', 'Earth', 'did', 'seem', 'scaled-down', 'version', 'feature', 'film', 'Naylor', 'had', 'hoped', 'make', 'frankly', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'play', 'out', 'TV', 'form', 'was', 'able', 'focus', 'heart', 'concept', 'tragicomic', 'situation', 'Lister', 'getting', 'lost', 'lot', 'cinematic', 'froo-fraw', 'Part', 'Three', 'one', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'main', 'inspirations', 'thorough', 'twitting', 'long', 'been', 'asking', 'downside', 'Rimmer', 'Cat', 'Kryten', 'are', 'rather', 'relegated', 'being', 'Lister', 'spear', 'carriers', 'explanation', 'hand', 'be', 'key', 'whole', 'business', 'story', 'have', 'Lister', 'do', 'something', 'singularly', 'shocking', 'Maybe', 'two', 'somethings', 'depending', 'how', 'feel', 'what', 'Lister', 'also', 'Rimmer', 'mean', 'how', 'much', 'punishment', 'one', 'incorrigibly', 'smegheaded', 'hard-light', 'hologram', 'deserve']",N/A

I really would never have thought I'd say that about a show, but without it Red Dwarf just didn't really feel like Red Dwarf.

People were so mixed about it that I kind of hesitated to have my warm fuzzy feelings of the series impacted by this, but I finally sat down & watched it.No worries, for the most part this was pretty good. It didn't follow the last season for some reason, but it kept the whole dark & serious atmosphere that the show seemed to have developed towards the end. The absence of the laugh track really seemed to hammer this home since there was no laughter to lighten the mood.Anyway, story-wise this miniseries was pretty interesting. Our boys escape to an alternate earth in an attempt to stay alive but discover that in this reality they're just characters on a popular TV show & that the plot has them dying by the show's end. Unhappy with this, they decide to take charge & find the writer so they can beg for more life. It's an interesting enough premise & everyone looks like they were having quite a bit of fun with it. I have to say, Chris Barrie looked to be having the most fun out of all of them & looked quite at home here.It's just that this didn't entirely capture the feeling of the previous seasons. I didn't mind that it didn't pick up after the last episode, but something just seemed to be missing here.

The series 8 finale was a poor cliffhanger that promised more Dwarf, but none came. With BTE Doug Naylor has cleverly reset the series, brought it back to the screen and to people's attention and if just for that alone, BTE is a great addition to Red Dwarf.

But in this parallel universe they exist as nothing more than fictional characters whose existence depends entirely on the whim of their creator, who they must track down in order to retain both their identity and existence.The movie is basically a series of events they go through and people they meet on their way to finding their creator.  There is an absolutely wonderful segment which has Dave Lister encounter two young kids on a bus - a boy and a girl; the boy fully understands Lister's heartbreak at losing Kochanski.  And, as you might expect, their final encounter with their creator is a no-holds-barred, pull-out-all-the-stops existential confrontation of epic proportions, after which they goof around a bit then go home to their own reality - aware at last that, yes, they really do exist and really do have their own place in their own universe.Thank goodness for that.",5,As Wonderfully Clueless As Ever,1343952000,"08 3, 2012",2012,1598,"['One', 'many', 'threads', 'running', 'entire', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'series', 'how', 'totally', 'clueless', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'thing', 'almost', 'literally', 'forget', 'who', 'where', 'are', 'Were', 'not', 'convoluted', 'series', 'events', 'movie', 'simply', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', ""'re"", 'faced', 'what', 'absolute', 'proof', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'not', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'way', 'get', 'way', ""'ve"", 'always', 'managed', 'get', 'little', 'existential', 'blips', 'keep', 'plodding', 'just', 'were', 'real', 'entities', 'really', 'existed', 'course', 'are', 'real', 'past', 'have', 'gotten', 'parallel', 'universe', 'situation', 'parallel', 'universe', 'exist', 'nothing', 'more', 'fictional', 'characters', 'existence', 'entirely', 'whim', 'creator', 'who', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'order', 'retain', 'identity', 'existence.The', 'movie', 'basically', 'series', 'events', 'go', 'people', 'meet', 'way', 'finding', 'creator', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'segment', 'Dave', 'Lister', 'encounter', 'two', 'young', 'kids', 'bus', 'boy', 'girl', 'boy', 'fully', 'Lister', 'heartbreak', 'losing', 'Kochanski', 'might', 'expect', 'final', 'encounter', 'creator', 'no-holds-barred', 'pull-out-all-the-stops', 'existential', 'confrontation', 'epic', 'proportions', 'goof', 'bit', 'then', 'go', 'home', 'own', 'reality', 'aware', 'last', 'yes', 'really', 'do', 'exist', 'really', 'do', 'have', 'own', 'place', 'own', 'universe.Thank', 'goodness']",N/A

I'm about the last fan of Red Dwarf to find out about this existing and accidentally came across it on the flix. I didn't really know if it aired originally as a 3 part series or movie but it works better as a movie to be seen all at once.That said, it is a great way to bring closure on the phenomenon that is Red Dwarf. I've been watching it since the early 1990s when I was a little boy in London. I came to the USA and vaguely recalled watching the final 2 seasons in the late 90s on PBS13/Channel 21 in NYC on friday nights. A few years back I got the DVD set for Xmas and watched all eight seasons as an adult marvelling how still entertained I was and how Red Dwarf was and still is one of the best Sci Fi series of all time. I was dissapointed with the way the series closed out, but the final seasons had the best episodes of the collection since season one. What ""Back To Earth"" does is not continue were we left off in 1998 or 1999 but create something new here. The slapstick comedy has indeed toned down a bit, but the sci fi is still exciting and drives the plot. In fact, Red Dwarf has two fan sets, those who love it for the comedy and those, like me, who find the actual science that the series uses so well to drive the plot to be the most entriguing part of the series. Imagine a show that takes Quantum Mechanics, Astro physics, Physiological Psychology, Engineering and grinds it all up to make a genuinely entertaining comedy whiles poking fun at Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate and other generic Space operas.That said, I sat down with Back To Earth not knowing what to expect and not seeing any previous Red Dwarf episodes since 2006 and I was very much entertained and glad the story went this way. It is a NEW story, NEW plot and uses all the old main characters well. I also loved the love story between Kochanski and Lister and although it was touched upon briefly I am happy with how that was sorted.I actually LOVED the ending because I wasn't expecting that and for a 22 year old TV series to suprise me and catch me off guard with an incredible plot twist in 2010 (after the art of the plot twist has been beaten to death by shows like LOST, 24, etc...)

Utilizing Netflix (I usually buy almost everything I watch on DVD, but I thought these sets way overpriced) I started with Season One and worked my way all the way through Season Eight.  I then found a website that streamed these episodes.  Watching the episodes and then hitting some fan boards it became clear that while I enjoyed the show in its middle years (from Season Three when Kryten became a full time character to the end of Season Six), I was not the fan that many were.  Still, I even mildly enjoyed Seasons Seven and Eight and looked forward to what many are calling ""Season Nine.""  Heck, I'll even watch Season Ten if it materializes.But being objective, this miniseries isn't very good.  First and foremost, there are a lot of dead moments, when either the pacing and timing isn't quite right, or the jokes just aren't working.  There are also some decent bits, but in the end it is more of a wash between the good and flat moments.  I suppose it is worth watching, especially if you are a fan of the series as a whole, but some fans might prefer to remember the show as it was.I'm not quite sure why the miniseries was based on BLADE RUNNER.  None of the best bits of the show rely on its imitation of that film.  I mean, once you've caught on that they are imitating BLADE RUNNER, what else is there?  It just doesn't lead to anything.  It isn't good writing so much as a substitute for good writing.Still, even if it isn't a terribly successful miniseries, it was great to see Lister, Kryten, Rimmer, and Cat all together again.  For me, at least, the group still works as an ensemble and I would welcome a continuance of the series.

1251958,A15PN25PUG3NI,B0026P3HPW,"S. Perry ""Padre""","[2, 2]","three just don't seem to be quite enough.Honestly I, as it seems many people, felt a little let down by Back To Earth.  Not to say it's, bad, but it cerainly fell short of the high expectations I had for it.It suffers from many problems.First, It really just feels like one episode on steroids and never really developes over the course of what's really three.  Second, someone seems to have hit the reset button on the characters and they seem like one-dimensional versions of themselves-- Lister, the heart-sick slob, Rimmer, the up-tight dweeb, Cat, the fasion-conscious narcisist, and Kryten, the festidious android.  There seems to be little or no memory of the growth they've undergone over the last eight seasons.Another problem is it doesn't actually do anything to resolve the cliffhanger at the end of season eight.  It just opens with a shot of Lister walking through the ship with the caption, ""9 years later.""  There's no Holly--either of them, and Chloe Anette only makes a brief appearance.Finally, and the biggest problem is, if this is really ment to be the final chapter in the saga it only leaves you wanting more.Now given what I've just said it's a wonder I didn't slap it with one star and just type ""It Sucks!"", but it's still Red Dwarf and there's still a great deal of the old mojo left in the ship.Along with the laughs that are found here, the plot gets downright philosophical with the crew members meeting some of the series' fans when they go in search of their maker.  The whole Bladerunner tribute that runs through out is fairly well done; I particularly like the guy who ""just does noses.""And most importantly the cast is still the cast and they've got enough in the talent department to pull through even the weakest moments in this one.Overall, Yes I was disappointed, but half a dwarf is still better then none.  I think this would have worked far better if it had been developed over the course of a full 6 or 8 episode series and had been brought to a proper, satisfying end, but maybe the back door was left open for a reason and there's still more to be heard from Smeghead, Listy and the crew--at least one can hope.",4,"OK, so 4 stars is a little generous, but...",1255219200,"10 11, 2009",2009,2158,"['three', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'enough.Honestly', 'many', 'people', 'felt', 'little', 'let', 'down', 'Back', 'Earth', 'Not', 'say', 'bad', 'cerainly', 'fell', 'short', 'high', 'expectations', 'had', 'it.It', 'suffers', 'many', 'problems.First', 'really', 'just', 'feels', 'one', 'episode', 'steroids', 'never', 'really', 'course', 'what', 'really', 'three', 'Second', 'someone', 'have', 'hit', 'reset', 'button', 'characters', 'seem', 'one-dimensional', 'versions', 'Lister', 'heart-sick', 'slob', 'Rimmer', 'up-tight', 'dweeb', 'Cat', 'fasion-conscious', 'narcisist', 'Kryten', 'festidious', 'android', 'be', 'little', 'memory', 'growth', ""'ve"", 'undergone', 'last', 'eight', 'seasons.Another', 'problem', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'anything', 'resolve', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'season', 'eight', 'just', 'shot', 'Lister', 'walking', 'ship', 'caption', '9', 'years', 'later', 'Holly', 'Chloe', 'Anette', 'only', 'brief', 'appearance.Finally', 'biggest', 'problem', 'really', 'ment', 'be', 'final', 'chapter', 'saga', 'only', 'wanting', 'more.Now', 'given', 'what', ""'ve"", 'just', 'said', 'wonder', 'did', ""n't"", 'slap', 'one', 'star', 'just', 'type', 'still', 'Red', 'Dwarf', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'old', 'mojo', 'left', 'ship.Along', 'laughs', 'are', 'found', 'here', 'plot', 'downright', 'philosophical', 'crew', 'members', 'meeting', 'series', 'fans', 'when', 'go', 'search', 'maker', 'whole', 'Bladerunner', 'tribute', 'out', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'particularly', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'noses', 'most', 'importantly', 'cast', 'still', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'got', 'enough', 'talent', 'department', 'pull', 'even', 'weakest', 'moments', 'one.Overall', 'Yes', 'was', 'disappointed', 'dwarf', 'still', 'better', 'then', 'none', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'far', 'better', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'course', 'full', '6', '8', 'episode', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'proper', 'satisfying', 'end', 'maybe', 'back', 'door', 'was', 'left', 'open', 'reason', 'still', 'more', 'be', 'heard', 'Smeghead', 'Listy', 'crew', 'least', 'one', 'can', 'hope']",N/A
