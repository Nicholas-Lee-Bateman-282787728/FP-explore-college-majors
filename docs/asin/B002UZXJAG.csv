She was superior before, and she has not made it to the top yet; but her growth, as shown here, is amazing and beyond any question, she is the star of this performance.  Many of us have followed this group from the beginning and seeing Chloe develop into a superstar of vocal talent is one of those amazing and heartwarming experiences.  Her vocal talent, positiveness, sincerity and genuine manner both on and off stage is fantastic and is the superior contributor to the group's reputation among its fans.The show itself is superior and, of course, greatly enhanced by Chloe's outstanding voice, presence and performance.

However, this show, to me, is their worst. It seems as if they are trying to replicate the commercial yet lovely ""A New Journey"" show, but this just falls apart. There is too much smoke, fireworks, and flames that were messy and distracting, the background drummers and huge bagpipe choir that were overdone and did not add much to the show, as well as way too much focus on the choir members, especially Helen Kelly, who ends up pretty much in every camera shot. The camera shots themselves were quick and gave me the impression of someone cutting and pasting several 1- second scenes together in a very short period of time (contrast with the first DVD, where they had less time to work on it but it looks far better). The music choices were only ok, but check out my review of the CD for my views on that. The costumes were not memorable; what happened to the girls dressing in different colors and styles or even wearing the same color but in different styles? And, finally, of course, the music and voices aren't performed live, but one can't expect Celtic Woman to change that this far into its existence.In short, this DVD was poorly executed and poorly put together.

The concert was shot in an excellent location and the girls' voices are in top form.  I don't even know where to begin because this concert is amazing and probably one of the best they have ever done.  The songs really show off their voices, good choices were made.Some of the highlights are Lisa's gorgeous renditions of Fields of Gold and The Moon's A Harsh Mistress, Mairead's energetic performances of The Coast of Galiia and Slumber My Darling/The Mason's Apron, the fun, upbeat cover of Nil S&eacute;'n L&aacute;, Chloe's version of When You Believe, the group performance of O, America! (I can't get through this song without shedding a tear), and Lynn's beautiful My Lagan Love.  One of Alex's songs that I like, You'll Be In My Heart, was on the show, but is not on the song list here.  It's a shame that's not on the DVD.  I think there are a few other omissions from what I've been reading.  The Call is a good opening number and You Raise Me Up was a great closer.  I have nothing but good things to say about this show, I would recommend it to all fans of Celtic Woman and this could possibly gain some new fans for the girls.

1291078,A1XQP1HXYJCUZP,B002UZXJAG,Dan Coffee,"[10, 11]","It's enough to make me cry. Not from the beautiful music, but from the truly below average picture quality. When I first watched the DVD I assumed the inclement/foggy weather, which plagued them during the hours leading up to the video recording, had caused it to be difficult to get the cameras to find the correct focus, but ... just a couple nights ago I caught a replay of the PBS telecast and the PBS broadcast is breathtakingly clear. Now something else is clear. It's clear that the production company (who released this disc) either thinks people are still viewing DVDs on 19"" CRT television sets or, perhaps they just don't have much respect for people who expect to get the best today's technology offers. Furthermore, it's hard to explain WHY the producers would spend so much for the staging of the performance, record it in HD quality and then release it on DVD in a quality so poor that it is little better than VHS with a bit of up scaling.I will say that the audio on this disc is probably the best of the Celtic Woman collection but even it is second fiddle to the PBS broadcast audio. Most noticeable was that the fireworks at the finale are almost entirely muted.I don't regret buying the DVD but I really am bewildered at the mediocrity of the overall quality.

1291080,A1ROYTFVKXZUY5,B002UZXJAG,E. Smith,"[23, 26]","I'm a big Celtic Woman fan, having seem them live numerous times and owning all of their CDs and DVDs. That said, I'm an honest reviewer, and if I see a problem with a product, I say it. I see a few issues with this DVD, so let's discuss the good and the bad.Overall, this is a great show. Would I say it's their best to date? I'm not sure. Those of you who saw the Isle of Hope tour last year will recognize a number of songs, which I was very happy about since there will not be an Isle of Hope CD or DVD. It's great that we haven't lost those songs.The location is superb. I was happy they chose to record outdoors in Ireland again, however challenging it may be. You can't beat the lush, green backdrop and Powerscourt is divine! The girls look fantastic as always, and I must say these are my favorite dresses to date.Now, let's start with the bad news. Here are my issues: First, the song list. Overall, it's good, but it's not great. In my opinion, there are far too many slow numbers and not enough fast, upbeat songs. ""Nil S'en La"" is about as far as it goes on the upbeat numbers, along with M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad's solos, of course. I really missed having songs similar to ""Sing Out!"" from ANJ (just to give you an example). There were a LOT of slow numbers in this show (the majority are slow), and after a while I was needing something upbeat to keep my interest.That kind of leads me into my second point, which is that they absolutely should have included ""Carolina Rua"" in the show. I think that was their biggest mistake here. It's a fast, cute, cheerful song, and it would have brought a little spice to the show when it was needed. There were just too many slow moments for me. They redeemed themselves a bit by having the ""Finale/Mo Ghile Mear"" at the end, but still. In addition, they need to axe ""Danny Boy"" and ""You Raise Me Up."" They've done them over and over again in DVDs, and while the ladies do a fantastic job, they've been done. It's time to retire them and give the people something else. I'm at the point where I always skip them on the CD and DVD.My next issue is with the choice of solos. I find it rather unfair that Lynn and Alex, the two newsest girls, only get one solo each. I'm not going to lie, I'm a super biased Lisa fan and a big M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad fan as well, so I'm not complaining that they get more solos, but in the interest of fairness I think it's a bit sad that Lynn and Alex only get to show off their solo abilities once in the entire DVD. (Again, if they'd included ""Carolina Rua,"" part of this problem would have been solved!).Now, for the good. #1 best thing about this DVD? The extras! Even though a bunch of additional behind the scenes segments have shown up on YouTube that aren't on the DVD, the extras on the DVD are just as good, and clearly the best we've seen on a DVD so far. I mean, come on, you really can't beat seeing the girls goofing off and having a good time. It reminds us that they're just regular people too. ;)#2 best thing? The sheer talent from these ladies. Time and time again they don't cease to amaze me, and for those of you who claim they lipsynch, I can assure you they do not. I have sat front row at their shows and those are their natural voices, plain and simple. Some of the song choices are simply gorgeous: ""Non C'e Piu"" is an amazing song, and I of course adore Lisa's ""Fields of Gold."" ""N'il S'en La"" is arguably one of the best songs on this DVD, if not THE best, and one that I could watch over and over. I think that will be the biggest crowd pleaser at the live shows. ""Coast of Galicia"" is FANTASTIC, and I was ecstatic that they included it. Again, it gives some much needed spice!Anyway, like I said before, overall a good DVD with a few minor issues.

From the song selection, her understanding about the songs that she chose, and the emotion that she put into each of these songs, you can tell that she is very smart. If you have sawn all the Celtic Woman recordings, you should notice that, in every concert, she put in a new song that just reflects her personality and her love. On top of all that, she is a wife and a mother. You can see how perfect she is.Here, I must give a credit to David, the conductor. It is he who gathers all these beautiful and talented women together to give outstanding performances.

Batty,"[3, 3]","For inexplicable and inexcusable reasons, the DVD drops two of the best songs from the live performance, namely Alex Sharpe's ""I'll be in Your Heart,"" and Lynn Hillary's ""Carolina Rua.""  I purchased the DVD primarily to see Lynn Hillary on stage, as she is admittedly a heart throb of mine.  I wasn't disappointed.  However, I thought Alex Sharpe's rendition of ""I'll be in Your Heart"" was a stand-out performance.  I had neither seen nor heard anything of Alex until this DVD.  Her on-stage presence is amazing.  Lisa, Chloe and Mariread are such polished veterans that they exude a slightly diffused form of confidence that almost borders on the uninspirational.  The two new members thus automatically become the focus for the observer.  A pity they received short shrift when the powers that be were compiling ""Songs From the Heart.""  Whatever the ""justification,"" Lynn has left CW, and it isn't quite clear whether Alex will be on board for the next tour/DVD.  It's difficult not to wonder what is going on after the loss of Orla, Meav and Hayley.  My suspicion is that there are artistic differences that cause the ladies to bow out.  Alex's ""I'll be in Your Heart"" is a very strange exclusion from a DVD entitled ""Songs From the Heart.""  On top of that obvious observation, the speculation can only be fed by the fact that ""I'll be in Your Heart"" is probably the best performance in the entire concert.  I am by no means unhappy about buying the DVD, but I had to resort to YouTube's stuttering recording of Alex's ""I'll be in Your Heart"" to more fully absorb the on-stage magic of Alex.  Her unique facial expressions, her sideways glances, her unforced smile, etc., were captivating, seducing and generally a big uplift.  If given the chance, this would have been her DVD.

Is there no end to Ireland's richness in music and in the beauty of their musical women? I have every one of the Celtic Woman DVDs, and this new one, ""Songs From The Heart"" is as stirring and entertaining as you will find anywhere. It is a wonderful follow-up to ""A NEW JOURNEY""  and to their Christmas special from a couple of years ago. I look forward to enjoying their music for many years to come. I don't know if I want to say that this is their best, as their best is what they do every time, but ""SONGS FROM THE HEART"" will always hold a very special place in my heart, and in my collection.As an American, their renditions of ""ISLE OF HOPE, ISLE OF TEARS"", about Ellis Island, and ""O, AMERICA"" bring tears to my eyes every time I hear and watch. They are absolutely wonderful, a must! They have done for the U.S. what no American artist has done in a very long time, a patriotic tune with heart and with soul, and with an enduring appeal. I am, in fact, watching the DVD as I write this.If I am in need of cheering up, some peace in my life, or just a need to be entertained and to see and hear absolute beauty, this is where I go, to CELTIC WOMAN, and thier new DVD, ""SONGS FROM THE HEART"". I still watch their original show DVDs, ""CELTIC WOMAN"", and ""A NEW JOURNEY"", as well as their Christmas special, ""CELTIC WOMAN, A CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION"" (even when it isn't Christmas time). Two years between performances is too long for me, but I understand how long it takes to write new music and put it all together to give us an enduring tapestry of musical beauty.I also hope to finally get to see these wonderful performers in person, and hopefully soon!

The emmense talent of all the singers is somewhat lost in so many group songs. There should have been more single and duet songs. Especially with the new girls Alex, and Lynn. There were several songs that are redundant from previous dvd's. Although they were re-scored it was somewhat old. There is plenty of material, as highlighted on the single cd's, that new material should have been used more often. The 20 min recording of how the show was put together highlighted what it took to create the program and the human interest side of the singers. However, it was basically a waste of time.

I have to say that I was relieved by how this dvd looked; being that it's not in high definition. Not too bad; but, it's true, it needed improving.That said, I think the women outdid themselves once again. Mairead was spectacular as she danced and skipped across the stage while playing the fiddle. How she does it, I don't know. She was the highlight of the show. Really a joy to see!!Lisa was beautiful as always and the songs she sang suited her to a T. I really loved ""Fields of Gold"" and ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress"". What a voice she has!!Chloe, enchanting in how she moves and sings her songs. She really does come alive on stage. It was also fun to hear Chloe speak when she introduces the song ""O America""; or, when Lisa thanked the audience during the song ""You raise Me Up"" for being such a 'wonderful audience'. To me, it gives them more charm...The two new women, Lynn and Alec, well, they sure captured my heart, as they sang their songs. I did see the PBS show, and I do wish Alec's song ""You'll be in my Heart"" was on this dvd and Lynn's ""Carolina Rue"". They performed these songs so beautifully that it's really shocking that these songs were not included.""True Colours"" sung by Alec, and ""When You Believe"" sung by Chloe were favorites of mine. Lynn's ""My Lagan Love"", even though it was a very slow song, is another favorite. The opening song ""The Call"" was beautifully done by all. ""Nil se'n La was performed charmingly by the girls as they danced and sang across the stage, a welcome change after the slower songs.I also loved the background piece they included, cluing us in on how the show was made, what went wrong etc. It also showed how the girls interacted with each other and how they practiced their songs etc.Weren't the green dresses on the choir eye-catching?? Loved the bag pipes!! This whole show was a delight to see. The backdrop of Powerscourt Gardens was really, really beautiful and I wish I was there live to see it.

The setting where they held the Concert at Powerscourt I believe it's called is absolutely stunning. Makes a beautiful background and the stage was set up in a great configuration that added to the whole look and style of the concert. Loved all the songs that were done. They did a great job with the whole production. They just get better with time it seems.The only down side is that they did not include Alex singing ""You'll Be In My Heart"". It was one of the best highlights to the whole concert and visually stunning. I miss seeing that part each time we watch it and wish they wouldn't have excluded it. At least we have the PBS version showing it taped and we will be keeping that tape so now and then we can watch this part that was excluded. Despite that I highly recommend this DVD and as a companion to it the Deluxe CD that includes more songs from the concert. We love Celtic Women and have followed them the last 3-4 years on PBS. It's great to see them getting better and better. We thoroughly enjoy having this DVD. Buy it you won't be disappointed except for missing the song that Alex sang on it.
