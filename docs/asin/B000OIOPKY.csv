1064552,A38EH8VYQFRKY0,B000OIOPKY,Jessica C. Bullock,"[4, 9]","The Derby Stallion could have been done alot better. It appeared to be a very low budget film. Its about this boy who decides he wants to ride steeplechase and convinces his parents to allow him to. The riding was very sloppy and some of the sences of him first riding were un realistic and alot of it was put into slow motion, like when he was first learning to jump. The two horses that played in the movie were also two completley different colors. The movie idea was good, but they could have spent more time on teaching the actor to ride and handle horses instead of what appeared to be a very rushed movie. Not a good choice for people who know a thing or two about horses.",3,Not what I was hoping for...,1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,679,"['Derby', 'Stallion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'alot', 'better', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'boy', 'who', 'ride', 'steeplechase', 'parents', 'allow', 'riding', 'was', 'very', 'sloppy', 'sences', 'first', 'riding', 'were', 'un', 'realistic', 'alot', 'was', 'put', 'slow', 'motion', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'learning', 'jump', 'two', 'horses', 'played', 'movie', 'were', 'also', 'two', 'completley', 'different', 'colors', 'movie', 'idea', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'teaching', 'actor', 'ride', 'handle', 'horses', 'instead', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'very', 'rushed', 'movie', 'Not', 'good', 'choice', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'thing', 'two', 'horses']",The Derby Stallion

It was shot well, but their was no driving force that kept my attention to the screen without reminding me of how much of a cable TV movie this is.

They used a different horse in almost every scene, one moment the horse has a blaze face and the next, no markings at all. When the actor (zac) was riding it was completely unrealistic.

1064555,A2GPEV42IO41CI,B000OIOPKY,Kona,"[7, 10]","15-year old Patrick (Zac Efron) is new in town and has problems:  He can't seem to please his jock father (William R. Moses) and he runs afoul of Randy, the town bully, when both boys are attracted to the same pretty girl.  Patrick's only friend is one-time horse trainer and long-time alcoholic, Houston Jones (Bill Cobbs), who sees something special in the boy.  Houston gives him a horse and trains him to ride in the State Steeplechase Cup race, but Randy, the reigning champ, decides to make Patrick's life miserable.This low-budget but pleasant 2005 film was never shown in theatres, but has been released on DVD following Zac Efron's mega-successes inHigh School Musical (Encore Edition)and Hairspray.  There's no denying Efron's Tiger Beat-cuteness, and he does a fine job in an undemanding role, but if you want to see a real actor, take a look at Bill Cobbs.  He's been playing small character parts in TV and movies for years, but this time he's the star and absolutely owns the screen.  His craggy face and gravelly voice masterfully express the only real emotion in the film and he's a pleasure to watch.The story plays like an After School Special;  all obstacles are easily overcome - the kid goes from non-rider to race winner, bonds with his father, and gets the girl - all in a matter of weeks.  Adults may find it predictable and a bit bland, but the wholesome message about finding your passion and working hard for it makes ""The Derby Stallion"" just right for family viewing.",4,Pleasant family film,1186617600,"08 9, 2007",2007,1496,"['15-year', 'old', 'Patrick', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'new', 'town', 'problems', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'please', 'jock', 'father', 'William', 'R.', 'Moses', 'afoul', 'Randy', 'town', 'bully', 'when', 'boys', 'are', 'attracted', 'same', 'pretty', 'girl', 'Patrick', 'only', 'friend', 'one-time', 'horse', 'trainer', 'long-time', 'alcoholic', 'Houston', 'Jones', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'who', 'something', 'special', 'boy', 'Houston', 'horse', 'ride', 'State', 'Steeplechase', 'Cup', 'race', 'Randy', 'reigning', 'champ', 'make', 'Patrick', 'life', 'miserable.This', 'low-budget', 'pleasant', '2005', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'shown', 'theatres', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'following', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'mega-successes', 'inHigh', 'School', 'Musical', 'Encore', 'Edition', 'Hairspray', 'denying', 'Efron', 'Tiger', 'Beat-cuteness', 'fine', 'job', 'undemanding', 'role', 'want', 'see', 'real', 'actor', 'take', 'look', 'Bill', 'Cobbs', 'been', 'playing', 'small', 'character', 'parts', 'TV', 'movies', 'years', 'time', 'star', 'absolutely', 'screen', 'craggy', 'face', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'masterfully', 'express', 'only', 'real', 'emotion', 'film', 'pleasure', 'watch.The', 'story', 'plays', 'School', 'Special', 'obstacles', 'are', 'easily', 'overcome', 'kid', 'non-rider', 'race', 'winner', 'bonds', 'father', 'girl', 'matter', 'weeks', 'Adults', 'may', 'find', 'predictable', 'bit', 'bland', 'wholesome', 'message', 'finding', 'passion', 'working', 'hard', 'Derby', 'Stallion', 'just', 'right', 'family', 'viewing']",The Derby Stallion
