1388130,A3PEN0MCANLUOK,B00477VLZK,Coulter Rail,"[1, 1]","Gantz is an interesting piece indeed.  It's a psychological experiment, and a cruel peepshow of the human mind, covered in porn obsessed, violent fan service.  It's an odd example of a show that works in a bold, intrusive way (if you let it).  It's easy to hate, punishing to love, and impossible to ignore.  I know a lot of people that loathed watching the whole series, but still . . . watched to whole series.  Why does this work, and why doesn't it?  That fact that people feel so strongly for or against it, is its goal.  Gantz, the enigma.  Let's get to it.***PROS***STORY/CONCEPT:When certain people die in Tokyo, they are unknowingly transported to an empty room with a huge black sphere in the middle.  After enough of them have been amassed in confusion, the sphere opens, providing them weapons and tech suits.  The group is then transported outside, and told to hunt down aliens and kill them.  No one in the real world can see them.  They either kill the aliens or get killed.  If you reach 100 points, you supposedly get your life back.  The concept is the perfect engine for forcing people from different walks of life into survival situations.  Unraveling the truths and lies of this world is maddening, and I can see how people could get annoyed quickly.  I for one welcomed the labyrinth.CHARACTERS:There are a ton of characters in Gantz.  They drop left and right with no mercy throughout the show.  3 characters take center stage, and the narrative mainly revolves around them.  They are very realistic, in the sense that they are severely unlikable and pathetic at times.  Your hero is a pervert (not in the comedic way) and selfish.  Your female lead is desperate and manipulative.  The 3rd and most noble of them cries at the drop of a hat, and can't see past his own moral code.  Whether we like it or not, humanity is crawling with these people and we all share some of these traits, if even in the smallest degree.INNER NARRATION:The inner thoughts of all the characters are voiced for us.  If our hero agrees to help someone, we instantly hear his brain trumpet that he actually hates the idea and why.  This is the most effective element to the show.  You'll be amazed and embarrassed at how closely some of your mental reactions parallel some of the worst characters.MUSIC:The music is tech infused and ghostly.  It sounds like Clint Mansel's heart crushing score to ""Requiem for a Dream.""FAN SERVICE:There are gratuitous amounts of blood, terrifying death scenes, and sex everywhere.  While it feels like excess at times, it fittingly accompanies this series and aims to keep the viewer immersed in nastiness.***CONS***PACING/CHARACTER LIMBO:The show insists on milking EVERYTHING.  While I understand the creators wanting to saturate us with an idea, I also get tired of waiting for the pay off.  Sometimes the narrative sticks on a characters hesitation and inaction for what seems like a whole episode.  Its effective 20% of the time.  The other 80% is aggravating to the max, and I think serves to detach the audience from the story.ANIMATION:Gantz saves its animators' talents for the action and nudity.  When not gushing blood or heaving breasts at you, it degrades into choppy motions and regrettable shot blocking.  The incorporation of CG backgrounds is jarring and low quality.  It looks like a Play Station 2 game.  The fact that the show is suppose to be game-like, saves it a bit, but not by much.  The animation is not bad it just needs to be better.ENDING:There's no conclusion.  Like Berserk, and Death Frenzy, this show will leave you hanging.  Both the shows I just mentioned have a purpose to ending it the way they do, but not Gantz.  Being told to read the Manga is just not good enough.All in all, this show is hard swallow, but undeniably original, worth the risk, and offensive in all the right ways.  The characters are hard to love, but if you do, it feels earned.  If your easily offended, require concrete storylines, and are not interested in the worst human psychology has to offer, than keep moving.  This show has faults, but most are intentional.I'm an animator and writer, so I frequently pour through stacks of anime.  If this was helpful or our tastes seem to align, follow along.  I'll try to steer you straight.",4,"Neo ""Lord of the Flies"" vs. XXX Fan Service",1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,4279,"['Gantz', 'interesting', 'piece', 'indeed', 'psychological', 'experiment', 'cruel', 'peepshow', 'human', 'mind', 'covered', 'porn', 'obsessed', 'violent', 'fan', 'service', 'odd', 'example', 'show', 'bold', 'intrusive', 'way', 'let', 'easy', 'hate', 'punishing', 'love', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'loathed', 'watching', 'whole', 'series', 'still', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'Why', 'work', 'why', ""n't"", 'fact', 'people', 'feel', 'so', 'strongly', 'goal', 'Gantz', 'enigma', 'Let', 'get', '***PROS***STORY/CONCEPT', 'When', 'certain', 'people', 'die', 'Tokyo', 'are', 'unknowingly', 'transported', 'empty', 'room', 'huge', 'black', 'sphere', 'middle', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'amassed', 'confusion', 'sphere', 'opens', 'providing', 'weapons', 'tech', 'suits', 'group', 'then', 'transported', 'told', 'hunt', 'down', 'aliens', 'kill', 'one', 'real', 'world', 'can', 'see', 'kill', 'aliens', 'get', 'killed', 'reach', '100', 'points', 'supposedly', 'get', 'life', 'back', 'concept', 'perfect', 'engine', 'forcing', 'people', 'different', 'walks', 'life', 'survival', 'situations', 'Unraveling', 'truths', 'lies', 'world', 'maddening', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'annoyed', 'quickly', 'one', 'welcomed', 'labyrinth.CHARACTERS', 'are', 'ton', 'characters', 'Gantz', 'drop', 'left', 'right', 'mercy', 'show', '3', 'characters', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'narrative', 'mainly', 'are', 'very', 'realistic', 'sense', 'are', 'severely', 'unlikable', 'pathetic', 'times', 'hero', 'pervert', 'not', 'comedic', 'way', 'selfish', 'female', 'lead', 'desperate', 'manipulative', '3rd', 'most', 'noble', 'cries', 'drop', 'hat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'own', 'moral', 'code', 'like', 'not', 'humanity', 'crawling', 'people', 'share', 'traits', 'even', 'smallest', 'degree.INNER', 'NARRATION', 'inner', 'thoughts', 'characters', 'are', 'voiced', 'hero', 'help', 'someone', 'instantly', 'hear', 'brain', 'trumpet', 'actually', 'idea', 'why', 'most', 'effective', 'element', 'show', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed', 'embarrassed', 'how', 'closely', 'mental', 'reactions', 'parallel', 'worst', 'characters.MUSIC', 'music', 'tech', 'infused', 'ghostly', 'Clint', 'Mansel', 'heart', 'crushing', 'score', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'FAN', 'SERVICE', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'amounts', 'blood', 'terrifying', 'death', 'scenes', 'sex', 'everywhere', 'excess', 'times', 'fittingly', 'series', 'keep', 'viewer', 'immersed', 'nastiness', '***CONS***PACING/CHARACTER', 'LIMBO', 'show', 'milking', 'EVERYTHING', 'understand', 'creators', 'wanting', 'saturate', 'idea', 'also', 'get', 'tired', 'waiting', 'pay', 'off', 'Sometimes', 'narrative', 'sticks', 'characters', 'hesitation', 'inaction', 'what', 'whole', 'episode', 'effective', '20', '%', 'time', 'other', '80', '%', 'aggravating', 'max', 'think', 'serves', 'detach', 'audience', 'story.ANIMATION', 'Gantz', 'animators', 'talents', 'action', 'nudity', 'When', 'not', 'gushing', 'blood', 'heaving', 'breasts', 'choppy', 'motions', 'regrettable', 'shot', 'blocking', 'incorporation', 'CG', 'backgrounds', 'jarring', 'low', 'quality', 'Play', 'Station', '2', 'game', 'fact', 'show', 'suppose', 'be', 'game-like', 'bit', 'not', 'much', 'animation', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'be', 'better.ENDING', 'conclusion', 'Berserk', 'Death', 'Frenzy', 'show', 'will', 'leave', 'hanging', 'shows', 'just', 'mentioned', 'have', 'purpose', 'ending', 'way', 'do', 'not', 'Gantz', 'Being', 'told', 'read', 'Manga', 'just', 'not', 'good', 'enough.All', 'show', 'hard', 'swallow', 'undeniably', 'original', 'risk', 'offensive', 'right', 'ways', 'characters', 'are', 'hard', 'love', 'do', 'earned', 'easily', 'offended', 'require', 'concrete', 'storylines', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'worst', 'human', 'psychology', 'offer', 'keep', 'moving', 'show', 'faults', 'most', 'are', 'intentional.I', ""'m"", 'animator', 'writer', 'frequently', 'pour', 'stacks', 'anime', 'was', 'helpful', 'tastes', 'seem', 'align', 'follow', ""'ll"", 'try', 'steer', 'straight']",N/A
1388131,A3474ZR07UN1CJ,B00477VLZK,"DL ""never slacking in pace, only lacking mist...","[4, 6]","I have mixed feelings regarding this show.  Hope I dont give away too many specifics about the show here... Overall I liked it and I like the premise, but there are some things that annoyed me about it.Things I dont like about Gantz... The show tends to drag at times.  The missions actually happen in slower than real time!  For example, if they have a 1 hour mission, it takes 3 or 4 episodes to get through.  There might be a segment that lasts 5 minutes, and then they show the game clock and only 1 minute has passed.  In the middle of fights, there are periods of extended dialouge that is a little too long winded.  And one of the most frustrating things for me was during the beginning of the third mission, there are a few epidoes where everyone is so reluctant to fire their weapons.  Its very unrealistic for two people to aim their weapons at an alien, then talk with eachother for 5 minutes about how they should shoot the alien, but never actually do.  And then in the meantime they blow their opportunity.  Time and time again this happens.  These are the kind of things that frustrate me while watching.  Every time they enter the room for a new mission, you have a new crop of people, which brings all the same questions... Where are we?  What is going on?  Of course no one believes the one who is trying to explain the situation.  It gets a little old going through this routine every time.  And the ending of the show is a bit vauge.  I would have definitely liked to see an ending with a little more clear resolution.  It might sound like I didnt like the show, but I do.  I think it could have been a great show, but instead it was more of a 'good' show.Things I like about Gantz... The concept is interesting.  There is plenty of gore, violence, and even some nudity and sex.  It doesnt seem forced in there, while at the same time they dont shy away from it.  I wouldnt call it fan service, but if there is a situation where a girl is exposed, they show it instead of panning away.  If there is a sexual situation, they show it instead of just insinuating it.  There is plenty of foul language, which may seem over the top, but its actually probably pretty accurate as far as the way many people speak in real life.  The portrayal of this show is pretty realistic to me.  Which is why I'm disappointed in the aspects that are not, like the long-winded dialouge and apprehention to shoot when in life and death situations.  If you are not offended by bad language, violence, gore, nudity and sex, then I would recommend Gantz.",4,Hmm what to say about Gantz...,1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,2549,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'show', 'Hope', 'dont', 'give', 'away', 'too', 'many', 'specifics', 'show', 'here', 'Overall', 'liked', 'like', 'premise', 'are', 'things', 'annoyed', 'it.Things', 'dont', 'Gantz', 'show', 'drag', 'times', 'missions', 'actually', 'happen', 'slower', 'real', 'time', 'example', 'have', '1', 'hour', 'mission', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'get', 'might', 'be', 'segment', '5', 'minutes', 'then', 'show', 'game', 'clock', 'only', '1', 'minute', 'passed', 'middle', 'fights', 'are', 'periods', 'extended', 'dialouge', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'winded', 'one', 'most', 'frustrating', 'things', 'was', 'beginning', 'third', 'mission', 'are', 'few', 'epidoes', 'where', 'everyone', 'so', 'reluctant', 'fire', 'weapons', 'very', 'unrealistic', 'two', 'people', 'aim', 'weapons', 'alien', 'then', 'talk', 'eachother', '5', 'minutes', 'how', 'should', 'shoot', 'alien', 'never', 'actually', 'do', 'then', 'meantime', 'blow', 'opportunity', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'are', 'kind', 'things', 'frustrate', 'watching', 'time', 'enter', 'room', 'new', 'mission', 'have', 'new', 'crop', 'people', 'same', 'questions', 'are', 'What', 'going', 'course', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'trying', 'explain', 'situation', 'little', 'old', 'going', 'routine', 'time', 'ending', 'show', 'bit', 'vauge', 'would', 'have', 'definitely', 'liked', 'see', 'ending', 'little', 'more', 'clear', 'resolution', 'might', 'sound', 'didnt', 'show', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'show', 'instead', 'was', 'more', ""'good"", 'show.Things', 'like', 'Gantz', 'concept', 'interesting', 'plenty', 'gore', 'violence', 'even', 'nudity', 'sex', 'seem', 'forced', 'there', 'same', 'time', 'dont', 'shy', 'away', 'wouldnt', 'call', 'fan', 'service', 'situation', 'where', 'girl', 'exposed', 'show', 'instead', 'panning', 'away', 'sexual', 'situation', 'show', 'instead', 'just', 'insinuating', 'plenty', 'foul', 'language', 'may', 'seem', 'top', 'actually', 'probably', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'as', 'far', 'way', 'many', 'people', 'speak', 'real', 'life', 'portrayal', 'show', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'Which', 'why', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'aspects', 'are', 'not', 'long-winded', 'dialouge', 'apprehention', 'shoot', 'when', 'life', 'death', 'situations', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'bad', 'language', 'violence', 'gore', 'nudity', 'sex', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'Gantz']",N/A

The main stories were fine.But a major underlying theme (note I said theme, and not plot/story) in the series is how unfair and f#^%ed up life is and can be.Most of the characters in this Anime have (or had, depending on how you view Gantz's resurrection of the characters) difficult hardships and struggles in their lives.  Yes, I understand the concepts of Back Story and Character Development and, yes, I was able to feel more empathy/attachment towards the characters.

I would be lying if I said I outright hated this series because I hold a bit of nostalgia for it, but even I'll admit the dub by today's standards borderlines on terrible. The concept for the show is great, but the slow pacing and forced philosophy is a bad fit for an anime that's main appeal is science fiction, boobs and brutal violence. That being said, Gantz has moments that will have you gasping. It isn't afraid to kill off main characters or present them in truly grim situations. It's completely rough around the edges, but the manga is much better, so I highly recommend giving it a read before writing off the series completely. I may be a little soft on the first 3/4 of the series, but the filler ending is disgraceful, and I won't defend it in any way. After disk 3, just put the DVDs back on the shelf.

1388134,A20MOP928FGVCE,B00477VLZK,Mindscrew Delight,"[5, 12]","Gantz is about A sexually desperate jerk named Kei Kurono and his morally stable friend named Kato who die while trying to save a homeless man on subway tracks. The two are teleported to a room where groups of already dead(?) people are sent to hunt down and kill aliens for points. A black sphere called Gantz (which houses a naked man with an oxygen mask and cords going into his head) sets the mission and provides suits and weapons for everybody. 100 points and a person can be free of the game. A clich&eacute; plot that is thin and little more than Battle Royale meets Yu Yu Hakusho.The pace is REALLY slow. Even though Gantz sets a 1 to 1 1/2 hour time limit for each mission, you watch every single second of it, and in some cases, even longer. But that wouldnt nessessarily be a bad thing as long as these missions moved along nicely. They don't. Hilariously, but not intentionally, characters argue and contemplate entire speeches at a time, often while a vicious killer monster stands still and waits patiently for the 10 minute bicker-fest to end!Another big tick is the amount of time it spends on bullies and biker gangs and Kei's unfathomable horniness. The perversion is not only pointless to the story, but its also not funny. Well, its not funny to me anymore... because I watch enough anime, to where i'm at the point of rolling my eyes at it every time, because pervert humor is sooooooo generic in anime. Gimme a break...The good thing about this show is that the art is really cool, even most of the CG actually manages to look decent (there are a few exceptions, though). The voice acting is great and used with some pretty choice dialouge. The mass killing and extreme violence actually helps make these battles quite intense... at times it had me frozen in place by how hard it slaps the viewer in the face. This can be a good and a bad thing, depending on your personality. And if you have a gore complex, Gantz delivers. If you can wait-out all the bitching and indecision, then strap yourself in. This makes Elfen Lied look like a mosquito bite.*****WARNING!! THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS.***** There is problems with inconsistancy in Gantz. Like when Kato came so close to bleeding to death after at the end of the first battle before being teleported and revived immediately after the last target had been eliminated. But for some reason, the Gantz delays teleportation at the endings of the final two battles, just to squeeze in one more character death at the last second! WTF was THAT for!? It also never really explains if the participants are actually dead or not. Characters contemplate it, opinions differ, but there is zero elaboration. There is a repeated theme throuout the second half of the series: ""No labyrinth is inescapable."" This implication leads the viewer into intreague, wondering if the characters would find a way to escape the battle and defeat the Gantz itself. This got my hopes up real high, as I started to expect this series to have a great ending, But what to we get instead? Another massive onslaught of character death, followed by an ultra-vague ending that answers no questions whatsoever about the Gantz, and leaves you to wonder if Kei is hallucinating, of if he actually got his 100 points (which is hard to believe, because he only had 52 points at the start of the finale). One last complaint: Kishimoto's death is so stupid that it had me LAUGHING, despite how serious they tried to make it look and sound. When Kato is about to be splashed by flesh-melting acid, she plays the heroine and bravely... hugs him for 3 whole friggin minutes instread of tackling him out of the path of the acid! Creaters of this anime, let the forehead slapping begin!! *****END OF SPOILERS*****In conclusion, Gantz is packed with flaws. This is a turn-off-your-brain-and-watch-violence anime if I'v ever seen one. If only the show would have answered the interesting questions it put out, and diddn't waste so much time, Gantz would have been alot less of a disappointment.",2,"""Flesh will be torn.

The basic story is you have an unknown advanced technological stationed Orb called Gantz in an apartment where it transports people who are going to be killed or near death and reconstitutes them back to where it is to as far as I can tell from the story kill off aliens that or hiding on the earth.  The series doesn't really give to much detail on why Gantz wants to kill these aliens or what Gantz's true agenda apparently is,  but the supposed reward is that for every mission that the people that Gantz has brought into this receives a certain amount of points and when they reach their quota they are released and free to live their lives again without interference from Gantz supposedly.  There is nudity and some sex scenes in the show that I felt weren't really needed as well as a near rape scene in the first episode,  I know some people appreciate those kinds of things in dark animes like this one but I didn't.  The only other thing I disliked about this series was one of my biggest negatives with a series and that is one lacking any character to really cheer for or that endears you to them,  they make most of the characters inconsequential you don't hate them but you're not bummed out when they are killed either and that for me is what makes a disappointing series.  The voice cast for both the subbed and dubbed were decent enough though the animation was a 50/50 with me not bad but reminded me a little of another series called Gilgamesh(Another disappointing series).  The ending is a little ambiguous on what happens so it's unknown on if their planning on making another season or not though hopefully if they do they can at least give us some better and more personable characters to root for...",2,A Unique But Ultimately Forgetful Series,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,1923,"['like', 'bloody', 'gory', 'anime', 'series', 'here', 'good', 'one', ""n't"", 'reach', 'nightmarish', 'level', 'series', 'Shigurui', 'did', ""'ll"", 'still', 'get', 'more', 'share', 'violence', 'basic', 'story', 'have', 'unknown', 'advanced', 'technological', 'stationed', 'Orb', 'called', 'Gantz', 'apartment', 'where', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'death', 'back', 'where', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'kill', 'off', 'aliens', 'hiding', 'earth', 'series', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'much', 'detail', 'why', 'Gantz', 'kill', 'aliens', 'what', 'Gantz', 'true', 'agenda', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'reward', 'mission', 'people', 'Gantz', 'brought', 'certain', 'amount', 'points', 'when', 'reach', 'quota', 'are', 'released', 'free', 'live', 'lives', 'again', 'interference', 'Gantz', 'supposedly', 'nudity', 'sex', 'scenes', 'show', 'felt', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'needed', 'as', 'well', 'near', 'rape', 'scene', 'first', 'episode', 'know', 'people', 'appreciate', 'kinds', 'things', 'dark', 'animes', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'only', 'other', 'thing', 'disliked', 'series', 'was', 'one', 'biggest', 'negatives', 'series', 'one', 'lacking', 'character', 'really', 'cheer', 'make', 'most', 'characters', 'inconsequential', 'do', ""n't"", 'hate', ""'re"", 'not', 'bummed', 'out', 'when', 'are', 'killed', 'either', 'what', 'disappointing', 'series', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'were', 'decent', 'enough', 'animation', 'was', '50/50', 'not', 'bad', 'reminded', 'little', 'series', 'called', 'Gilgamesh', 'disappointing', 'series', 'ending', 'little', 'ambiguous', 'what', 'unknown', 'planning', 'making', 'season', 'not', 'hopefully', 'do', 'can', 'least', 'give', 'better', 'more', 'personable', 'characters', 'root']",N/A

It focuses more on the uneventfull lives of the people and less on the action. And even then the action is painfully slow. Worst of all are the characters. They do nothing but argue with eachother and stand around. In some cases 9 of them with weapons will stand there watching one person get the crap beat out of him for thirty minutes then everyone freaks out when he gets killed. They constintly stand around while they could be saving each other. It just gets really annoying. Seriously, Everyone has guns but no one will ever shoot anything. They just keep talking about how they should or shouldn't shoot while they and their friends are being killed.I know it doesn't happen often but I think the movie was better than the series.
