This is apparently based on a very popular children's book I haven't read. A cat turns into a woman after coming across some chemical stuff spilled from a barrel. She finds herself transformed into a woman on the rooftops of her small town. Eventually, she takes refuge in the apartment of a struggling but honest reporter, and through her ability to communicate with her fellow cats, she helps him expose a case of local corruption (a scoop that saves him from being fired from his newspaper). This movie wouldn't work as well as it does without the charming perfomance of Carice Van Houten (she starred in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book) as the titular woman/cat.
