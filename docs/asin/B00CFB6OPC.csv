However, in this movie, these characters are actually all portrayed AS the ""good people.""Again, though, if you can ""suspend judgment"" on this oddity, it's still a well-done movie and will keep your attention.",4,"Depressing and Lacking Integrity, But Still Well Done",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",2013,1124,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'light', 'comedy', 'moral', 'integrity', 'characters', 'movies', 'important', 'then', 'skip', 'one.However', ""'re"", 'willing', 'sit', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'movie', 'large', 'number', 'characters', 'have', 'integrity', 'then', 'look.I', 'found', 'interesting', 'teenage', 'son', 'sex', 'girlfriend', 'mother', 'house', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care.-', 'teenage', 'boy', 'then', 'girlfriend', 'move', 'mother', 'house', 'continue', 'have', 'sex', 'regular', 'basis', 'mother', ""n't"", 'seem', 'care.-', 'girlfriend', 'then', 'sex', 'teenager', 'boy', 'older', 'brother.-', 'teenage', 'boy', 'drug', 'dealer', 'dating', 'boy', 'mother.In', 'normal', 'movie', 'characters', 'would', 'be', 'portrayed', 'negative', 'light', 'good', 'people', 'movie', 'would', 'come', 'rescue', 'force', 'bad', 'people', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', 'However', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'all', 'portrayed', 'good', 'people', 'Again', 'though', 'can', 'suspend', 'judgment', 'oddity', 'still', 'well-done', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'attention']",Crazy Kind of Love

1646738,AAKZEBYCO9UBB,B00CFB6OPC,peter nisius,"[0, 0]",A sweet film about love. Including that which is lost and that which can found. Perhaps most importantly about continuing to look for love and keeping your eyes looking forward. I like Virginia Madsen a lot and thought her terrific in this hidden gem. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a simple tale.,4,A like able treasure!,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",2014,318,"['sweet', 'film', 'love', 'Including', 'lost', 'can', 'found', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'continuing', 'look', 'love', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'looking', 'forward', 'like', 'Virginia', 'Madsen', 'lot', 'thought', 'terrific', 'hidden', 'gem', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'looking', 'simple', 'tale']",Crazy Kind of Love
