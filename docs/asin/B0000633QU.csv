It is no wonder he reprised the role for TV's Buffy verses Dracula (Season 5, episode 1 of Buffy The Vampire Slayer).This is a very good movie that looks at the good and bad of the historical Dracula and at the end of the film even ties in some of the vampire story so that the film works as a loose prequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula starring Gray Oldman.  I strongly recommend this film for any fan of Dracula or of the history of the middle ages.  The film is very well done, very moody, very atmospheric and surprisingly educational.This has fast become one of my favorite Dracula movies in that it teaches a fairly true version of the events of the historical Dracula's life and also adds the slight sprinkling of the vampire mythos by implying he became the vampire after death.  Rudolf Martin is a seriously under-rated actor who should get a lot more attention for his Dracula portrayal.",5,A very fascinating movie,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,1025,"['are', 'relatively', 'small', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'found', 'Rudolf', 'Martin', 'portrayal', 'Dracula', 'be', 'incredibly', 'good', 'wonder', 'reprised', 'role', 'TV', 'Buffy', 'Dracula', 'Season', '5', 'episode', '1', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', '.This', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'bad', 'historical', 'Dracula', 'end', 'film', 'even', 'ties', 'vampire', 'story', 'film', 'loose', 'prequel', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'starring', 'Gray', 'Oldman', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fan', 'Dracula', 'history', 'middle', 'ages', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'moody', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'surprisingly', 'educational.This', 'fast', 'one', 'favorite', 'Dracula', 'movies', 'fairly', 'true', 'version', 'events', 'historical', 'Dracula', 'life', 'also', 'slight', 'sprinkling', 'vampire', 'mythos', 'implying', 'became', 'vampire', 'death', 'Rudolf', 'Martin', 'seriously', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'who', 'should', 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'attention', 'Dracula', 'portrayal']",N/A
692734,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B0000633QU,Arch Stanton,"[0, 0]","This movie has a lot going for it. It's a made-for-tv movie, but with a decent budget, filmed in Romania and dealing with the true and fascinating life of Vlad Dracula the prince of Wallachia (not Romania as they erroneously say in the film. That country didn't even exist yet). In other words this isn't another tired old vampire rehash. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way somebody decided that a tired old rehash was exactly what it should be. Just look at the cover for God's sake. That's not the guy playing Dracula and this guy certainly never wore fangs. I don't even think the word vampire was said in the entire film. Now they do bring up immortality and whatnot, but it doesn't jive with either the history or the legend. This Dracula is doomed because he left the Orthodox church and converted to Catholicism. Yup, betcha didn't know that becoming Catholic turned you into a monster. *Insert Catholic priest/altar boy joke here*This movie could have been two things: it could have been a straight historical drama with no supernatural stuff whatsoever, or it could be a story set in 15th century Romania about Dracula first becoming a vampire. Either one could be good. But these two things do not mesh. Is the conflict about Vlad gaining the throne and his family problems? Or is it about the loss of his soul? Because he never really seems to care about that last one and the former is irrelevant as far as the vampire angle is concerned. Perhaps if they had him slowly becoming corrupted in order to gain power then there might be something, but that would still make the gaining of power secondary to the conflict for his soul. Yet this film is primarily a historical drama with occasional supernatural interruptions often coming out of left field. If this is about a man selling his soul to the devil (or being the antichrist as they keep saying) then you cannot sideline that conflict. It'd be like making a movie focusing on life in the newspaper industry only to have them reveal by the end that the lead is actually Superman.As you might have guessed I find the supernatural side of this film to be overplayed and often forced. But it plays as a drama for 9/10 of the time. The only supernatural elements come with his wife and at the very end in a surprise twist that reduces an already nonsensical plot point into complete gibberish. The historical parts are sound, or at least entertaining. Yes they took serious liberties with his life and reduced the conflict to a ridiculously simple level, but on the whole it worked. Watching Dracula take his revenge was fun (although it could have lasted longer) and his relationship with his son was interesting if not used enough. To make up for underplaying the relationship with his son they make a big fuss over his relationship with his brother. Radu is a big part in this, and shows up in places where he wasn't meant to be. I don't just mean he wasn't there historically, but that his being there doesn't make any sense. And of course, his death was what allowed Dracula to return to the country in the first place, so why was he still alive when Vlad arrived?There is a lot to be said for the cinematography in this film. It was only a made-for-tv film but somebody forgot to tell the cinematographers that because these shots are stunning. It fully plays up the natural beauty of Romania. It's hardly the land of perpetual gloom and shadows that these Dracula movies make it out to be. Not that there aren't plenty of those scenes in the movie, but the main ones I remember are of lush hillsides and greenery. When those gorgeous hillsides are filled with decaying corpses on spikes it makes it seem even more disturbing. After all, what's more terrifying: the perpetually unrealistic doom filling most horror films or a man sitting down on a nice hill eating lunch surrounded by dozens of impaled corpses? The rest of the production design is varied. Some of the costumes look good, but many are just obviously modern in style with only slight quaint touches to make them feel older. Vlad for example is wearing something that looks an awful lot like a motorcycle jacket. Fight scenes are also somewhat sub-par (to be expected in a tv movie) but the cinematography is often superb. The opening fight in the rain is a great example.The story of the historical Dracula has actually been told on film before. There's an obscure Romanian film from 1980 called Vlad Tepes (or Vlad the Impaler) which isn't listed on Amazon but can be found elsewhere (the Amazon.de site for starters). That film is rather more accurate although it dwells overlong on such Communist tropes as dealing with greedy merchants and nationalistic posturing. The lead actor is a dead ringer for Dracula though. It's actually more than a little eery. It helps that they had excellent costumes and filming locations. The odd thing is that while both of these films are inaccurate in their own ways, their inaccuracies seem to complement each other. For example, while this Dracula looks nothing like the real man they do get the age right (he first became king in his 20s). The Romanian film makes Romania look ugly while this one makes it beautiful. That film captures Dracula's severity of law while this one captures his cruelty. This film included several of the horror stories associated with Vlad while that one just showed the impalings. And there are other examples. It's funny, combine these two together and you might have an awesome movie. As it is this one just isn't up to snuff. It's probably worth a watch, but it's unlikely to become a firm favorite.",3,Meh,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,5611,"['movie', 'lot', 'going', 'made-for-tv', 'movie', 'decent', 'budget', 'filmed',

692735,A1KVB4N4G2TD9Q,B0000633QU,"Carrie Lynn Frost ""Blood N Roses""","[0, 0]","This early-2000's film features the same actor who played - very well - Dracula in an eposide of Buffy the Vampire Slayer around this same time:  Rudolf Martin.  Handsome?  Check.  Exotic accent?  Check.  We have ourselves a vampire.This film, however, is based on the history of the real Vlad Tepes, or Vlad Dracul, who ruled what is now Romania, defended it against the Turks, and was reputed to be a huge fan of impalement (supposedly people feared this punishment so much, goblets of gold and other valuable objects could be left out in public unattended and no one would take them because they dreaded the punishment if they should be caught).  He also was reputed to dine among the bodies of his impalement victims and dip his bread in their blood (hence the blood-drinking element).The story begins as the adult Vlad is called to account for his actions before high priests of the Orthodox Church, who are going to determine whether to excommunicate him.  In this context, he tells his story from childhood on up, from his captivity in a Turkish camp with his brother, to his freedom returning to his native land, to his rule.  Also how he fell in love with a beautiful young nun-to-be, who returned his feelings and forsook her calling to the convent to marry him and give him a son.Spoilers Ahoy:  She is finally driven to kill herself as she becomes more aware of the atrocities her husband is committing, despite her own faith's teaching that suicide is the one sin that cannot be forgiven and so her soul will now never find rest.As the story and intrigue ends, Vlad is informed that his Orthodox Church elders have made the decision to excommunicate him, thus, according to their own belief system, dooming his soul to walk the earth for eternity as well.  The final scene sees the old priest hearing mysterious noises and going into the cellar where Vlad is buried after his death, only to have Vlad appear to him, very much alive, ""thanking"" him for giving him eternal life by banishing him from the Church and thus from the only way his soul could have found rest after his passing.The final image is of Vlad and his beloved bride, both now dead, walking hand-in-hand, as the titles inform us of an expedition to Vlad's tomb during which no human remains were found where he was supposedly buried.This well-made, semi-fictional historical drama blends the ""true"" story of the man, Vlad the Impaler, with vampire imagery and mythology very effectively.  Recommended both for fans of historical drama and vampire films.Enjoy.Cheers.",4,"Dark Prince, Dark History, Dark Romance",1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2546,"['early-2000', 'film', 'same', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Dracula', 'eposide', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'same', 'time', 'Rudolf', 'Martin', 'Handsome', 'Check', 'Exotic', 'accent', 'Check', 'have', 'vampire.This', 'film', 'however', 'based', 'history', 'real', 'Vlad', 'Tepes', 'Vlad', 'Dracul', 'who', 'ruled', 'what', 'now', 'Romania', 'defended', 'Turks', 'was', 'reputed', 'be', 'huge', 'fan', 'impalement', 'supposedly', 'people', 'feared', 'punishment', 'so', 'much', 'goblets', 'gold', 'other', 'valuable', 'objects', 'could', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'public', 'unattended', 'one', 'would', 'take', 'dreaded', 'punishment', 'should', 'be', 'caught', 'also', 'was', 'reputed', 'dine', 'bodies', 'impalement', 'victims', 'dip', 'bread', 'blood', 'hence', 'blood-drinking', 'element', 'story', 'adult', 'Vlad', 'called', 'account', 'actions', 'before', 'high', 'priests', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'who', 'are', 'going', 'determine', 'excommunicate', 'context', 'story', 'childhood', 'captivity', 'Turkish', 'camp', 'brother', 'freedom', 'returning', 'native', 'land', 'rule', 'Also', 'how', 'fell', 'love', 'beautiful', 'young', 'nun-to-be', 'who', 'returned', 'feelings', 'forsook', 'calling', 'convent', 'marry', 'give', 'son.Spoilers', 'Ahoy', 'finally', 'driven', 'kill', 'more', 'aware', 'atrocities', 'husband', 'committing', 'own', 'faith', 'teaching', 'suicide', 'one', 'sin', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'forgiven', 'so', 'soul', 'will', 'now', 'never', 'find', 'rest.As', 'story', 'intrigue', 'ends', 'Vlad', 'informed', 'Orthodox', 'Church', 'elders', 'have', 'made', 'decision', 'excommunicate', 'thus', 'according', 'own', 'belief', 'system', 'dooming', 'soul', 'walk', 'earth', 'eternity', 'as', 'well', 'final', 'scene', 'old', 'priest', 'hearing', 'mysterious', 'noises', 'going', 'cellar', 'where', 'Vlad', 'buried', 'death', 'only', 'have', 'Vlad', 'appear', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'thanking', 'giving', 'eternal', 'life', 'banishing', 'Church', 'thus', 'only', 'way', 'soul', 'could', 'have', 'found', 'rest', 'passing.The', 'final', 'image', 'Vlad', 'beloved', 'bride', 'now', 'dead', 'walking', 'hand-in-hand', 'titles', 'inform', 'expedition', 'Vlad', 'tomb', 'human', 'were', 'found', 'where', 'was', 'supposedly', 'buried.This', 'well-made', 'semi-fictional', 'historical', 'drama', 'true', 'story', 'man', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'vampire', 'imagery', 'mythology', 'very', 'effectively', 'Recommended', 'fans', 'historical', 'drama', 'vampire', 'films.Enjoy.Cheers']",N/A

692741,A1EZMV5DSWU8TU,B0000633QU,Draconis Blackthorne,"[11, 11]","This film attempts to portray Vlad Dracul in a more realistic manner, as far as specific events are concerned, such as:1. Rounding up traitors with the pretext of a drunken celebration, and then when all are pretty well enebriated, lighting the entire edifice aflame, thus ridding himself of possible antagonists to his reign.2. Dining at The Field of The Impaled, while dipping his bread in a goblet filled with blood and wine. Enemies turning back to their countries fearing the man who is capable of such a fearsome spectacle.3. The oft-times neglected fact that he also impaled women and children at times, depending upon their offense, in this case, for being ""adulterous"". In this sense, he was influenced by Judeo-christian moralism.4. Another truism related that one could veritable leave gold on the streets, and it would not be stolen, for fear of the punishment. Criminals were often seen impaled and immolated on the streets, which acted as a perfect deterrent. He actually displayed elements of Lex Talionis - as a result, crime was just about nil.5. Driving spikes into the skulls of Muslims who refused to remove their turbans. They should ""keep their traditions in their own country"".As far as the characterization is concerned, the mane-haired Vlad Tepesh {Rudolf Martin} is presented herein in a more or less romantic manner, sans moustache, and often wearing leather. 'Mina' as ""Lidia"" {Jane March} remains sheltered, and goes insane upon her realization of the actual events occurring in the kingdom, who then begins to superstitiously adorn herself with a rosary and calls Vlad a ""monster"" {""Voevod""}. Upon her suicide, he has all the mirrors in the castle covered, thus the mythological connection with the vampire ""unable"" to view his own reflection. She is survived by Vlad Jr., who displays great potential for leadership through his own ruthlessness.He encounters his traitorous younger brother on the battle field, and graciously spares his life instead of dispatching him, which he should have done, as well as his step-father, both of whom eventually prove to be major obstacles, from framing him, which lands him in prison for awhile, to attempts at assassination. Upon regaining the throne, he strikes a deal with Catholic King Janos {Roger Daltrey}, proclaiming that it does not matter to him under what banner he fights, so long as his rule continues, and thus, his own interests prevail.He seemingly resurrects on a couple of occasions, which lends to the legend of physical Vampiric  immortality, whose ""soul"" is unable to enter heaven or Hell, and is ""condemned"" to roam the earth in a state of the 'undead'; to which he remains thankful to the murderous priest, who himself meets his end via a heart attack - veritably scared to death. Quite a pleasing concluding scene, instead of the typical stake in the heart.Because of his indestructability and military genius, he is accused of being an antichrist by the Orthodox clergy, which seems to amuse him, when all he wanted to accomplish was the glorification of his country and the preservation of his kingdom, both at which he succeeds.I rather enjoyed this presentaion, where Vlad The Impaler relishes in his role as tyrant to his enemies, and savior to his people, who still hail him as a national hero, and expect his symbolic return in some form.Overall, Dracula: The Dark Prince is an aesthetically-impressive film, as Dracula / Vampiric presentations tend to be quite elegant from environment to accoutrement to deportment, and is probably the closest adaptation to actual events in the life of this remarkable historical figure, certainly an unforgettably mighty warrior. who remains an inspiration.",5,The Voevod returns...,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,3694,"['film', 'portray', 'Vlad', 'Dracul', 'more', 'realistic', 'manner', 'as', 'far', 'specific', 'events', 'are', 'concerned', 'such', 'as:1', 'Rounding', 'up', 'traitors', 'pretext', 'drunken', 'celebration', 'then', 'when', 'are', 'pretty', 'well', 'enebriated', 'lighting', 'entire', 'edifice', 'aflame', 'thus', 'ridding', 'possible', 'antagonists', 'reign.2', 'Dining', 'Field', 'Impaled', 'dipping', 'bread', 'goblet', 'filled', 'blood', 'wine', 'Enemies', 'turning', 'back', 'countries', 'fearing', 'man', 'who', 'capable', 'such', 'fearsome', 'spectacle.3', 'oft-times', 'neglected', 'fact', 'also', 'impaled', 'women', 'children', 'times', 'depending', 'offense', 'case', 'being', 'adulterous', 'sense', 'was', 'influenced', 'Judeo-christian', 'moralism.4', 'truism', 'related', 'one', 'could', 'veritable', 'leave', 'gold', 'streets', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'stolen', 'fear', 'punishment', 'Criminals', 'were', 'often', 'seen', 'impaled', 'immolated', 'streets', 'acted', 'perfect', 'deterrent', 'actually', 'displayed', 'elements', 'Lex', 'Talionis', 'result', 'crime', 'was', 'just', 'nil.5', 'Driving', 'spikes', 'skulls', 'Muslims', 'who', 'refused', 'remove', 'turbans', 'should', 'keep', 'traditions', 'own', 'country', '.As', 'far', 'characterization', 'concerned', 'mane-haired', 'Vlad', 'Tepesh', 'Rudolf', 'Martin', 'presented', 'herein', 'more', 'less', 'romantic', 'manner', 'sans', 'moustache', 'often', 'wearing', 'leather', 'Lidia', 'Jane', 'March', 'sheltered', 'insane', 'realization', 'actual', 'events', 'occurring', 'kingdom', 'who', 'then', 'superstitiously', 'adorn', 'rosary', 'Vlad', 'monster', 'Voevod', 'suicide', 'mirrors', 'castle', 'covered', 'thus', 'mythological', 'connection', 'vampire', 'unable', 'view', 'own', 'reflection', 'survived', 'Vlad', 'Jr.', 'who', 'great', 'potential', 'leadership', 'own', 'ruthlessness.He', 'traitorous', 'younger', 'brother', 'battle', 'field', 'graciously', 'life', 'instead', 'dispatching', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'step-father', 'whom', 'eventually', 'prove', 'be', 'major', 'obstacles', 'framing', 'prison', 'awhile', 'attempts', 'assassination', 'regaining', 'throne', 'deal', 'Catholic', 'King', 'Janos', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'proclaiming', 'not', 'matter', 'what', 'banner', 'so', 'long', 'rule', 'thus', 'own', 'interests', 'prevail.He', 'seemingly', 'resurrects', 'couple', 'occasions', 'legend', 'physical', 'Vampiric', 'immortality', 'soul', 'unable', 'enter', 'heaven', 'Hell', 'condemned', 'roam', 'earth', 'state', ""'undead"", 'thankful', 'murderous', 'priest', 'who', 'end', 'heart', 'attack', 'veritably', 'scared', 'death', 'pleasing', 'concluding', 'scene', 'instead', 'typical', 'stake', 'heart.Because', 'indestructability', 'military', 'genius', 'accused', 'being', 'antichrist', 'Orthodox', 'clergy', 'amuse', 'when', 'wanted', 'accomplish', 'was', 'glorification', 'country', 'preservation', 'kingdom', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'presentaion', 'where', 'Impaler', 'relishes', 'role', 'tyrant', 'enemies', 'savior', 'people', 'who', 'still', 'hail', 'national', 'hero', 'expect', 'symbolic', 'return', 'form.Overall', 'Dracula', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'aesthetically-impressive', 'film', 'Dracula', '/', 'Vampiric', 'presentations', 'tend', 'be', 'quite', 'elegant', 'environment', 'accoutrement', 'deportment', 'probably', 'closest', 'adaptation', 'actual', 'events', 'life', 'remarkable', 'historical', 'figure', 'certainly', 'unforgettably', 'mighty', 'warrior', 'who', 'inspiration']",N/A

Unfortunately, the full-frame presentation robs the DVD transfer of some of the impact it might have had in widescreen.  As for the story, it falls just short of the kind of rousing dark epic the producers were aiming for.  The character of Dracula is almost sympathetic, and the film doesn't try to explain away his brutality with simplistic rationalizations, but the end result lacks real impact.

Bernabo,"[15, 23]","I had long thought that a movie about Vlad the Impaler, the historical figure that was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula, would be a good choice for a film.  I even had the opening shot of the film worked out: a tracking shot across a field at ground level, increasingly littered with weapons and armor, but no bodies.  Then we start to see the bottoms of poles, more and more as we move along until poles appear in the foreground and finally we see one in close up and there is blood running down it.  Then the camera pans up and we see the body impaled on the top of the pole and then the camera slowly pulls back and we the entire forest of impaled Turkish soldiers.Yes, this is a movie just begging to be made.  Unfortunately, ""Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula"" is not that film.  The main problem is that the script by Thomas Baum decides to turn Vlad Tepes (1431?-1476?), son of Vlad Dracul (1390?-1447) into a teenage heartthrob played by Rudolph Martin (1967- ).  Historically Vlad the Impaler is remembered as a bloodthirsty tyrant with a reputation for creative cruelty Dante would have admired: in his brief six-year reign he is believed to have conservatively executed 40,000 victims.  His reputation was such that basically once they stopped printing up the first Bibles on the new printing presses they started printing up pamphlets about Vlad's deeps, with woodblock illustrations of his enjoying a feat while his victims suffered on their poles.  However, this 2000 film does not want to take that route and for some reason I suspect this is because ""Dark Prince"" was a made for television film instead of a theatrical release, where Vlad's actions could be more graphically displayed.The framing device for the story is that in 1476, shortly before his death, Vlad is brought before the inquisition of the Eastern Orthodox church and made to account for his actions.  Within this context he tells his life story, beginning when he and his brother Radu were held prisoners by the Turks as teenagers.  Upon his release Vlad claimed the throne of Wallachia (a.k.a. Romania) and slaughtering the nobles who betrayed his father.  Politically Vlad's kindgom is caught between the hated Turks and the untrustworthy King Janos of Hungary (Roger Daltrey).  Consequently, in the final analysis, ""Dark Prince"" wants to recast Vlad the Impaler as a 15th century freedom fighter.Consequently, ""Dark Prince"" wants to deal with Vlad as more of a morally ambiguous figure, a creature of his times who took actions out of political necessity and who was pretty good looking with his dark hair (which certainly runs counter to the man we see in the paintings believed to be Vlad).  However, what makes Vlad interesting from a historical perspective is that you can make the case that Vlad the Impaler is to Eastern Europe what El Cid was to the West in terms of being primarily responsible for stopping the Muslims armies from overrunning Christian Europe.  When a Turkish army approached his capital he initiated a scorched earth policy and impaled the Turkish advance guard around the walls of his city.  When he saw this the Sultan and his invading army retreated.  But this is a low-budget film so that scene was never going to be shot.At the end of ""Dark Prince"" we find out this film was only inspired by the history of Vlad the Impaler, which means it ends up being about as fictional as Stoker's ""Dracula,"" which brings up all sorts of attendant ironies to play with.  In the end, those who know about the historical Vlad will be distracted by all the liberties and distortions in the film while the neophytes would have yet another dose of ""history"" courtesy of a made-for-television movie.  There was a rather interesting gimmick with this film in that Martin played the vampire version of Dracula in the season premier of the fifth season of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and made a much better impression on the television show than he did in this made for television film.",3,Neither Stoker's Dracula or the historical Vlad the Impaler,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,3995,"['had', 'long', 'thought', 'movie', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'historical', 'figure', 'was', 'inspiration', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'film', 'even', 'had', 'opening', 'shot', 'film', 'worked', 'out', 'tracking', 'shot', 'field', 'ground', 'level', 'increasingly', 'littered', 'weapons', 'armor', 'bodies', 'Then', 'start', 'see', 'bottoms', 'poles', 'more', 'more', 'move', 'along', 'poles', 'appear', 'foreground', 'finally', 'see', 'one', 'close', 'up', 'blood', 'running', 'down', 'Then', 'camera', 'up', 'see', 'body', 'impaled', 'top', 'pole', 'then', 'camera', 'slowly', 'back', 'entire', 'forest', 'impaled', 'Turkish', 'soldiers.Yes', 'movie', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'made', 'Unfortunately', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'True', 'Story', 'Dracula', 'not', 'film', 'main', 'problem', 'script', 'Thomas', 'Baum', 'turn', 'Vlad', 'Tepes', '1431', '-1476', 'son', 'Vlad', 'Dracul', '1390', '-1447', 'teenage', 'heartthrob', 'played', 'Rudolph', 'Martin', '1967-', 'Historically', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'remembered', 'bloodthirsty', 'tyrant', 'reputation', 'creative', 'cruelty', 'Dante', 'would', 'have', 'admired', 'brief', 'six-year', 'reign', 'believed', 'have', 'conservatively', 'executed', '40,000', 'victims', 'reputation', 'was', 'such', 'basically', 'stopped', 'printing', 'up', 'first', 'Bibles', 'new', 'printing', 'presses', 'started', 'printing', 'up', 'pamphlets', 'Vlad', 'deeps', 'woodblock', 'illustrations', 'enjoying', 'feat', 'victims', 'suffered', 'poles', 'However', '2000', 'film', 'not', 'want', 'take', 'route', 'reason', 'suspect', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'was', 'made', 'television', 'film', 'instead', 'theatrical', 'release', 'where', 'Vlad', 'actions', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'graphically', 'displayed.The', 'framing', 'device', 'story', '1476', 'shortly', 'death', 'Vlad', 'brought', 'inquisition', 'Eastern', 'Orthodox', 'church', 'made', 'account', 'actions', 'context', 'life', 'story', 'beginning', 'when', 'brother', 'Radu', 'were', 'held', 'prisoners', 'Turks', 'teenagers', 'release', 'Vlad', 'claimed', 'throne', 'Wallachia', 'a.k.a', 'Romania', 'slaughtering', 'nobles', 'who', 'betrayed', 'father', 'Politically', 'Vlad', 'kindgom', 'caught', 'hated', 'Turks', 'untrustworthy', 'King', 'Janos', 'Hungary', 'Roger', 'Daltrey', 'Consequently', 'final', 'analysis', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'recast', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', '15th', 'century', 'freedom', 'fighter.Consequently', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'deal', 'Vlad', 'more', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'figure', 'creature', 'times', 'who', 'took', 'actions', 'political', 'necessity', 'who', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'looking', 'dark', 'hair', 'certainly', 'counter', 'man', 'see', 'paintings', 'believed', 'be', 'Vlad', 'However', 'what', 'Vlad', 'interesting', 'historical', 'perspective', 'can', 'make', 'case', 'Impaler', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'what', 'El', 'Cid', 'was', 'West', 'terms', 'being', 'primarily', 'responsible', 'stopping', 'Muslims', 'armies', 'overrunning', 'Christian', 'Europe', 'When', 'Turkish', 'army', 'approached', 'capital', 'initiated', 'scorched', 'earth', 'policy', 'impaled', 'Turkish', 'advance', 'guard', 'walls', 'city', 'When', 'saw', 'Sultan', 'invading', 'army', 'retreated', 'low-budget', 'film', 'scene', 'was', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'end', 'Dark', 'Prince', 'find', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'inspired', 'history', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'up', 'being', 'as', 'fictional', 'Stoker', 'Dracula', 'up', 'sorts', 'attendant', 'ironies', 'play', 'end', 'who', 'know', 'historical', 'Vlad', 'will', 'be', 'distracted', 'liberties', 'distortions', 'film', 'neophytes', 'would', 'have', 'yet', 'dose', 'history', 'courtesy', 'made-for-television', 'movie', 'was', 'rather', 'interesting', 'gimmick', 'film', 'Martin', 'played', 'vampire', 'version', 'Dracula', 'season', 'premier', 'fifth', 'season', 'Buffy', 'Vampire', 'Slayer', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'impression', 'television', 'show', 'did', 'made', 'television', 'film']",N/A

This film is strongly influenced by the Bram Stoker novel in mood and menace, but it is still highly entertaining and quite well done. Meant to be a historical drama about the real life of Vlad the Impaler, Dracula: The Dark Prince takes us to Romania in the 1400's, to see what made the man the legend he is today. The story is told from Vlad's point of view, as he recounts the story of his life before an Orthodox Ecclesiastical Court in defense of his crown. We first see Vlad as a child, training for battle with his father and younger brother, Radu. But soon after, Vlad's father is killed by the noblemen of his own country, who are constantly looking after their own interests above anything else. His brother kidnapped and brainwashed by a perverted Turkish Sultan, and himself believed to be long dead, Vlad eventually raises an army to help him take back the throne that rightfully belongs to him from the noblemen and their hand picked NEW prince. Once back in power, Vlad and his beautiful, new, young wife commence to having a son. Simultaneously, Vlad takes his revenge on the noblemen of his country who were responsible for the death of his father and so many others. With that matter taken care of, Vlad focuses on his main interest, dealing with the accursed Turks that have plagued him all his life. This brings up the problem of his younger brother, who is now one of them, and matters are not helped by the failing mental state of Vlad`s wife, who is disturbed more and more as she discovers the brutality of her husband`s style of government.While the film does mention and even depict Vlad's more legendary and gruesome exploits, those that were less likely to be true were presented only as rumors amongst the people and noblemen of Romania that the Prince himself always denied.  The film doesn't really take much of a fantasy angle, it simply drops hints here and there to remind you that this is the man known as Dracula. True, in the end the possibility that Vlad did become one of the undead is left open, but even the act that many have claimed ruined the reality of the film could easily be interpreted as the hallucination of a dying man.

His history was the basis for Bram Stoker's blood-sucking vampire, Dracula.  The movie is well made and I think I originally saw it on the History Channel during Halloween.Rudolf Martin is very good and quite attractive as Vlad.  The movie begins where he is recounting his life.  A younger actor portrays him as a teen when he and his brother are emprisoned by the Sultan.  When he is older and goes back to Romania, he fights to free his people from tyranny.  To do this he becomes a tyrant himself.  There are a few gruesome scenes that I think would be inappropriate for young children (he was called ""Vlad the Impaler"" for a reason).I've seen quite a few documentaries about the real Count Dracul and this is not actual fact as stated in the description.  It's some fact and mostly fiction.  The writers added some humor and some hints to where the vampire Dracula's and Count Dracul's lives seem to merge.  At one point, when he is being questioned by the priests, they mention that he dipped his bread in his victim's blood and ate it.  He wearily says, ""I've heard these stories so often, I'm beginning to believe them myself.""The real Count Dracul would be amused!",4,Fictionalized Movie about Vlad Dracul.....Not Dracula the Vampire,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1295,"['DVD', 'cover', 'very', 'misleading', 'actually', 'fictionalized', 'version', 'real', 'Count', 'Vlad', 'Dracul', 'life', 'history', 'was', 'basis', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'blood-sucking', 'vampire', 'Dracula', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'think', 'originally', 'saw', 'History', 'Channel', 'Halloween.Rudolf', 'Martin', 'very', 'good', 'quite', 'attractive', 'Vlad', 'movie', 'where', 'recounting', 'life', 'A', 'younger', 'actor', 'teen', 'when', 'brother', 'are', 'emprisoned', 'Sultan', 'When', 'older', 'back', 'Romania', 'free', 'people', 'tyranny', 'do', 'tyrant', 'are', 'few', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'inappropriate', 'young', 'children', 'was', 'called', 'Vlad', 'Impaler', 'reason', '.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'documentaries', 'real', 'Count', 'Dracul', 'not', 'actual', 'fact', 'stated', 'description', 'fact', 'mostly', 'fiction', 'writers', 'added', 'humor', 'hints', 'where', 'vampire', 'Dracula', 'Count', 'Dracul', 'lives', 'seem', 'merge', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'being', 'questioned', 'priests', 'mention', 'dipped', 'bread', 'victim', 'blood', 'ate', 'wearily', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'stories', 'so', 'often', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'believe', 'real', 'Count', 'Dracul', 'would', 'be', 'amused']",N/A
692750,A31VL4V54JG45L,B0000633QU,"""ruzzante""","[8, 12]","The Bram Stoker artifact and historical truth are at serious odds with each other in Dracula: The Dark Prince. As a result, this movie may disappoint many a Dracula fan. That said, though, the biographical details seem somewhat forced to conform to the Dracula legend; therefore, it may disappoint viewers who appreciate good dramatic history too! In fact, its lower-budget melodramatic gothic penchant for romance, marital hysteria, dramatic dialogues, and over-usage of dark, closed-in, night scenes may disappoint many a movie-goer, at first viewing at least.The rather interesting closing screen comments, however, are what most help the viewer to assess whether or not the movie was a success or failure. For example, ""In 1931, explorers dug up the tomb of Vlad Dracula, the Impaler; and they found only animal bones. In Romania, Vlad Dracula is still remembered as a savior to his country. Many pray for his return!""  In my opinion, it merits judging as a success, but, perhaps not successful enough! After all, here is a man believed to be a new messiah (not only an antichrist), yet the movie does little to define the messianic fervor of his life-long fight against the Turkish Sultan Mohammed! Here is a man who was loved (and is still loved today, more than 600 years after his death) by the subjects and citizens of his land, yet the movie again fails to illuminate this aspect of his reign! Etc.In brief, the biographical facts suggest that a very different movie could/should have been made. It should not have been a movie that pays respectful homage to coffin odors and Bram Stokers' gothic imagination but a movie that lets the viewers breath the same exhilaratingly fresh air as that breathed by a person whose true passion is for freedom and victory against incredible, overwhelming odds!

Shot on location in Romania with a largely Romanian crew.The DVD's cover art has very little resemblance to the feature. This is not a vampire movie, though at times it's dark and bloody.Martin (Vlad III) and March (Lidia) have many truly sublime moments in DARK PRINCE. The performances overall are well worth wading through the production's few awkward moments. Michael Sutton (Radu) and Christopher Brand (Bruno) add welcome depth with their supporting roles, as does Weller (Fr. Stefan) certainly.March's Lidia is almost distractingly modern in her distain for Dracula's methods, until considering noble daughters might well have been shielded from such political realities. It's Martin's portrayal of the medieval ruler that lingers, however. Coldly ruthless, commanding, born and trained to rule, weary of the necessary dancing with the Roman and Orthodox churches.

692753,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000633QU,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","""Dracula: The Dark Prince"": the title of this made-for-TV film is slightly misleading as it may make you think that the film is about vampires. It is not. Certainly the film stars Rudolf Martin as ""Vlad Dracula the Impaler"" or Prince of Romania (or Wallachia to be precise), one of the models of Count Dracula, but the story itself is not related to Bram Stoker's book or the blood-sucking Count himself. The film claims it is fact-based (and it is though very loosely), inspired by the real history of Vlad Dracula, often referred to as Vlad Tepes (Impaler).Raised by stern father, young Vlad and his brother Radu are later kidnapped and held hostage by the Turkish Sultan. After their father was murdered, only Vlad is allowed to go back to his country (reasons unexplained). Vengeful Vlad vows to free his country and brother Radu from the Turks and he enlists a financial help from Hungarian King Janos (Roger Daltrey). While staying at his court, he falls in love with King's daughter Lidia (Jane March) and marries her.All these incidents loosely based on the historical facts are told as memories of Vlad Dracula interrogated by Father Stefan (Peter Weller) and other priests trying to indict him for his atrocities. The short film includes many events, but as it is clearly low-budget, you cannot expect grand-scale battle scenes. But the film keeps slick storytelling which is not boring with convincing locations (shot in Romania, why not?) and the complex personalities of Vlad Dracula. I only wish that the film took more time to explore the meanings of his extremely harsh punishments as the ruler of the politically unstable country.""Dracula: The Dark Prince"" is not a horror film; it is more like a historical mini-series.
