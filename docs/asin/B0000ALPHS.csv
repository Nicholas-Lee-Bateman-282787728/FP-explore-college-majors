764590,AJT9NSPPF51A3,B0000ALPHS,Amazon Customer,"[8, 8]",I worried that this movie might be a little boring but purchased it anyway because I enjoy watching Jason Alexander and Ed Asner. I loved the small-town scenes and old-time romance between Jason's character and his wife.  These days it is hard to find a movie where a husband and wife support each other in spite of adversity and naysayers.  I love the fact that this is based on a real person.  It is heartwarming and will make you want to hug all your family.  This movie is suitable for all ages.,4,The Man Who Saved Christmas,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,499,"['worried', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'purchased', 'anyway', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Jason', 'Alexander', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'loved', 'small-town', 'scenes', 'old-time', 'romance', 'Jason', 'character', 'wife', 'days', 'hard', 'find', 'movie', 'where', 'husband', 'wife', 'support', 'other', 'spite', 'adversity', 'naysayers', 'love', 'fact', 'based', 'real', 'person', 'heartwarming', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'hug', 'family', 'movie', 'suitable', 'ages']",N/A

764595,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B0000ALPHS,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[7, 7]","This is a WWI period film about a man who invented and produced toys that become the wonderful classic and collectible toys for millions of children. Erector sets, science kits, chemist labs, microscopes, and more were made by this man, A. C. Gilbert who is played by Jason Alexander (The Grand, Seinfeld) in a remarkable drama role so different than those who remember him in Seinfeld.  And of course his father, played by Ed Asner, is powerfully cast and portrayed. This is based on a TRUE story.The real story here is not Christmas, although the plot is based upon that premise.  The wonderful bit of history learned about toy production during the pre-war and years of WWI are actually more of the story than Christmas.  It is a wonderful family tale, Hallmark-like, with the seal of Dove for all ages.  It is heartwarming, educational, emotional, fun, historical, fanciful, and even has a bit of holiday magic thrown in for good measure.  It is the pace and style of life that existed in teen years of the 20th century.No bonus material, just a very well done 88 minute story worth viewing. Worth owning. Worth a look by the whole family.This probably would never make a blockbuster in the theater but with it's price is a bargain value with a year-round story.

In time - with the support of his wife and brother - his dream becomes a reality. His toy factory is successful, but then the government asks him to convert his toy factory into a munitions factory. A.C. Gilbert does not want to imagine children without toys, so the decision to honor the request is very difficult for him. After a while, he loses his peace and happiness but with a little encouragement from family he comes up with a way to make toys again while still maintaining the defense contracts.This is a touching family movie with good messages about relationships; business, sibling, husband and wife - mostly father and son.
