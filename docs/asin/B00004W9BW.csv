The rest of the cast were very good.The singing was excellent as well as the scenery and the costumes.Before I bought this DVD I had never heard this opera, even though when I saw it I recognized some of the music.I decided to buy it because I had read good reviewers about this performance and I enjoyed a lot, it was fan.

Hansel and Gretel was originally written (and can be performed) as a relatively small scale opera, but the Met brought a great deal of wonderful large-scale stagecraft to the opera in a way that makes the production even more enjoyable.  Some of the great stage momemnts for me are the gingerbread house coming up from the stage, the various animals (really kids) who come out on stage, the 14 angels protecting the children, and the transformation of the gingerbread children into real children. The production on DVD is from a live broadcast.  The singing is very good with Judith Blegen (Gretel), Frederica von Stade  (Hansel), and a very hammy witch (Rosalind Elias).

Those were the days when Hansel and Gretel was about two waifs lost in the Black Forest.  Currently productions, I guess in an effort to make a fairy tale contemporary, now have a mother who tries to overdose, randy parents who need a ""nooner"", a witch who shows up with bare breasts, as well as any number of ""touches"" that must leave most children as completely bewildered as I am trying to figure out what is going onstage.  This reissue of a delightful, traditional performance  from The Met reminds us that a Fairy Tale is best told in a simple, easy to follow, manner.

Humperdinck was heavily influenced by Wagner and in Hansel and Gretel he produced an opera in the Wagnerian style but more accessible than Wagner's operas in length and humanity. This is one of the few operas ever written which is beautiful from beginning to end. Although I love this opera I have been disappointed in most of the video performances of it which I've seen so far. But I'm very pleased with this thoroughly satisfying performance by the Metropolitan Opera. Frederica von Stade as Hansel and Judith Blegen as Gretel are physically attractive as well as accomplished singers. The rest of the cast is quite good and the conducting and orchestral performance are outstanding. Yes, this performance is presented in English rather than the original German, but the translation is quite good and I quickly became absorbed in the beauty of this magnificent opera without concern for the language.

554433,A190VARUON9JVT,B00004W9BW,Jennie Johanson,"[7, 7]","I borrowed this version of Hansel and Gretel from the library shortly after watching the December 2007 version of the very same opera this Christmas. Hansel and Gretel has been my favorite opera ever since I heard the dramatized story version on CD by Jane Powell, but I was almost turned off by the gloomy, surreal world I saw in the modern version. It was refreshing watching opera the way it should have been done. Even though there were some dark undertones and a hideous witch, the 1982 Hansel and Gretel had a cheer and innocence that I found truly disarming.To start with, the relationship between the two main characters was beautiful to see. Judith Blegen played such a cute little girl, curly pigtails and all! Meanwhile, Frderica von Stade was a convincing older brother. My little sister, who was watching the movie with me, even mentioned what a good brother Hansel was after watching the scene where he covers her up with his coat at night while they're lost in the woods. They occasionally squabbled, which added realism to the story, but you could tell they loved each other.They really had to look out for each other when they got to the gingerbread house! As I said before, the witch was pretty scary with her warty nose, long chin and green petticoats, fingers, and tongue! We all gasped when we got our first glimpse of her frightening face through the window of the gingerbread house. However, once she began singing her lively song (""So Hop, Hop, Hop"") and flying on her broomstick, I think she became so fascinating that we forget to be afraid! Rolsalind Elias did an excellent job.So did everyone else at the Met it seems; the prop people, the costume designers, the angels, the orchestra, the conductor and anyone else I may have forgotten. And of course Englebert Humperdinck's music is just about the most beautiful ever written! The whole production was top notch. The only characters I didn't really love were the couple who played Hansel and Gretel's parents. They were definitely adequate, so I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that I didn't particularly care for them.Oh, I had one more thing to say. This is the first opera I've seen in English and I could understand nearly every word, although there were no subtitles. The translation seemed very good and went well with the music. I know some people swear by the original German, but I thought it was kind of nice to understand what everyone was saying. Bottom line: if you want to see a traditional staged version of Hansel and Gretel in English, this is the one to see!

What a delight to experience the magic of this performance on DVD! While opera, in general, is not noted for high quality acting, the performances of Judith Blegen (Gretel) and Frderica von Stade ( Hansel), who never seems to be other than visually and sonically lovely, are simply captivating! Blegen's soprano is lyric, light and smooth, and is perfectly matched by von Sade's mezzo. And Rosalind Elias, who earlier in her career was anything but, is a fantastic witch, who is obviously having a great time flying all over the stage. Humperdinck's lush and melodic score is well played by the Met Orchestra, and perfectly conducted by the talented Thomas Fulton. The disc's video is a wonderful marriage of performance and technology, and if the sound isn't Dolby 5.1, well this is opera, not Mission Impossible, so that the Dolby Stereo, works very well.

I remember the broadcast was hosted by ""Sesame Street""'s own Big Bird who explained to the viewers, many of them families with smaller children what to expect from an opera.  This production dated from 1967 and enjoyed a 40-year run at the Met.  It is a family-friendly production with fairy-tale sets, costumes and even young performers as forest creatures.  Judith Blegen and Fredirica von Stade are perfect in the roles of Gretel and Hansel, respectively and Rosiland Ellis is a wonderful witch.  The performers in the roles of Father and Mother are also very good, as well as the Sandman and Dew Fairy.  Special notice goes to the gingerbread children chorus.  They are well rehearsed, professional-acting, and sing very well.  The production is sung in English but the Met has been singing Hansel and Gretel in English for about 60 years.  I imagine this is because not many young people understand German.  Yes, the lyrics are simple but keep in mind children usually like simple, easy to follow lyrics, especially in a fairy tale.  There are English subtitles to augment the singing but, for the most part, the diction of the singers is excellent and you don't need them.  The Dream Pantomime is a sight to behold with its 14 angels magically appearing and protecting the children.  The sets all have a fairy-tale charm and the appearance of the witch's cottage is really special and got applause from the audience.  The orchestra is well conducted with a right balance of Wagnerian weight and opposing lightness.  These are illustrations over the Prelude but, hey, kids like pictures and I liked that they were sketches of the original designs.  The sound and direction/camerawork are excellent.

(The Met made sure it didn't look like singers hanging from wires--they really look like angels, and the effect is dazzling.)You'll love the witch, as she flies on her broom, or sticks out her green tongue.Although most people regard Hansel and Gretel as a children's piece, (and it is a lovely way to introduce children to the world of opera) the orchestration is so lush and rich that people of all ages will find themselves saying, &quot;I thought it was kids' music, but it's so beautiful.&quot;  This music was written by Humperdinck, who might be considered the heir to the sound of Mahler, and his music is as gorgeous as a Mahler symphony.Yes, this production is performed in English instead of the original German language, but perhaps that makes it a better vehicle to interest new-comers to opera.Buy it, enjoy it, and share it with those you love!",5,Gorgeous Music and a Charming Story,1070755200,"12 7, 2003",2003,1354,"['Metropolitan', 'Opera', 'grand', 'production', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'starring', 'Julith', 'Blegen', 'Frederica', 'von', 'Stade.It', 'absolutely', 'delight', 'eyes', 'ears', 'so', 'deliciously', 'done', 'can', 'almost', 'smell', 'gingerbread', 'taste', 'witch', 'candy', 'house', 'live', 'performance', 'likely', 'will', 'gasp', 'amazement', 'live', 'audience', 'did', 'witch', 'house', 'stage', 'Equally', 'well-executed', 'are', 'flying', 'angels', 'who', 'guard', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'sleep', 'Met', 'made', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'singers', 'hanging', 'wires', 'really', 'look', 'angels', 'effect', 'dazzling', ""'ll"", 'love', 'witch', 'broom', 'sticks', 'out', 'green', 'tongue.Although', 'most', 'people', 'regard', 'Hansel', 'Gretel', 'children', 'piece', 'lovely', 'way', 'introduce', 'children', 'world', 'opera', 'orchestration', 'so', 'lush', 'rich', 'people', 'ages', 'will', 'find', 'saying', 'quot', 'thought', 'was', 'kids', 'music', 'so', 'beautiful.', 'quot', 'music', 'was', 'written', 'Humperdinck', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'considered', 'heir', 'sound', 'Mahler', 'music', 'as', 'gorgeous', 'Mahler', 'symphony.Yes', 'production', 'performed', 'English', 'instead', 'original', 'German', 'language', 'perhaps', 'better', 'vehicle', 'interest', 'new-comers', 'opera.Buy', 'enjoy', 'share', 'love']",N/A

But really, there's no better word for this production.  The richly romantic score is wonderfully played by the orchestra, and sensitively conducted by Fulton.  The singers are uniformly good.  The fantasy elements are spectacular... the house, the forest, the flying of angels and witches add immeasurably to the production.  The only thing that I wasn't overly fond of was at certain moments the production was ""childrened down,"" like with the occasional addition of somewhat corny graphics.  But much better than some productions that remove anything ""dangerous"" at all, and have the witch played by a man as a drag queen!  All in all this is a wonderful production of a wonderful opera.
