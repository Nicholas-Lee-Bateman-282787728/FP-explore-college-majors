3587,A15E01890A5IX5,0767010485,Alison Leigh,"[7, 8]","Like the equally magnificent Mayor of Casterbridge, A&E; has done another wonderful job with this immensely entertaining adaption of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles.Everything from the casting to the sets to the acting is superb, and Justine Waddell truly shines as Tess. Not only is she breathtakingly beautiful in the role, but she conveys Tess's spirit and pluck as few other actresses could. Jason Flemyng as Alec D'Urberville is also a standout, and plays the role with a devilish charm that is irresistible. The rest of the cast is likewise great.The movie, at a running time of about three hours, moves along at a fast pace; anyone will most likely watch all of it in one sitting.Although the ending is depressing (as most of Hardy's novels are), the film is truly a treat that you won't want to miss out on.Bravo!",5,Absolutely Stunning Tearjerker,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,830,"['equally', 'magnificent', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'A', 'E', 'done', 'wonderful', 'job', 'immensely', 'entertaining', 'adaption', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles.Everything"", 'casting', 'sets', 'acting', 'superb', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'truly', 'Tess', 'Not', 'only', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful', 'role', 'conveys', 'Tess', 'spirit', 'pluck', 'few', 'other', 'actresses', 'could', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'Alec', ""D'Urberville"", 'also', 'standout', 'role', 'devilish', 'charm', 'irresistible', 'rest', 'cast', 'likewise', 'great.The', 'movie', 'running', 'time', 'three', 'hours', 'moves', 'along', 'fast', 'pace', 'anyone', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting.Although', 'ending', 'depressing', 'most', 'Hardy', 'novels', 'are', 'film', 'truly', 'treat', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'out', 'on.Bravo']",N/A
3588,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,0767010485,anna-joelle,"[174, 178]","Justine Waddell is truly brilliant in this skillful adaptation of Thomas Hardy's famous classic. Her &quot;Tess&quot; is breathtakingly beautiful without being at all self-conscious of her looks, and is genuinely charming and adoring. Whenever Tess cries (and she does that A LOT due to her tragic circumstances), it's impossible not to be affected or to reach quickly for the box of Kleenex.This is a sad and compelling story set in the later part of the 19th century, about a simple country girl named Tess who is the oldest child in a poor family with many children. Due to her family's poverty, she is forced, at 16, to find work (i.e. taking care of the fowl farm) at the great House of a family called the D'Urbervilles (whom Tess and her family are led to believe are their distant relations). Naive Tess (who then knows nothing about the &quot;dangers&quot; of men), is quickly courted and seduced by the young lord of the House, Alec (who has set his sights on her since the first day they meet), although she doesn't love him. In her distress, she later packs up and leaves the House to return home; both Tess and Alec not realizing that she is already carrying his child. The child is born but later dies of illness. Tess leaves home a second time and finds work as a dairymaid in a distant place where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare, the handsome and well-respected son of a clergyman. Angel, who is unaware of Tess's &quot;past&quot;, falls in love with her and holds her in awe for her virtue, beauty, grace and goodness of heart. Tess tries to tell him of her past, but each time, fate cruelly intervenes and she never gets her chance... until it is too late. On their wedding night, Angel confesses to Tess that he has been promiscuous in the past and begs for her forgiveness. Tess readily forgives him and with this opening provided by Angel, she proceeds to tell him of her past relations with Alec and the resultant child, truly believing that Angel will forgive her as he himself has been forgiven for his own past sin. But this is not to be.... and great tragedy (Hardy-style) ensues.I loved the novel, and find this adaptation to be one of the most supreme of period dramas ever produced. The casting, acting, directing, cinematography and screenplay are simply perfect.I particularly enjoyed the scenes where Alec is teasing and courting Tess e.g. the very picturesque and charming moment at the strawberry garden. It is also endearing and funny to watch Alec teaching Tess how to whistle (&quot;whistling&quot; being necessary as his mother, the eccentric matriach of the House, insists that Tess whistles to her caged birds every morning as part of her duties). Another funny and delightful scene is when Alec asks Tess for a good-bye kiss after failing to persuade her to stay on at the House. She immediately offers him her cheek (for the kiss), glares angrily at him and says: &quot;See how well you have mastered me!&quot;Inevitably, there are slight deviations from the novel e.g. Tess's sister, Liza-Lu does not appear in the last scene (as in the book). Also, Alec's character is portrayed in a better light in the movie i.e. he frequently shows his sincerity in loving Tess and persistently offering to take care of her. He has many faults.... but he does love her and has never abandoned her once he finds out about her destitute situation. Can't say the same for Angel's character, though. He can't accept Tess because he deems Alec to be her &quot;husband by nature&quot; and not himself. Angel may also be suffering from broken dreams and a broken heart, but with his hypocrisy and evident cruelty, he hurts and crushes Tess more than Alec ever does.This series (4-hour long) is a masterpiece one can watch over and over again, despite its tragic storyline. I love the theme song which is a beautiful melody that stayed in my head for days! In my personal opinion, Justine Waddell deserves an Oscar for her brilliant performance, and one fine production like this is worth 10 of Hollywood's blockbuster-&quot;Titanic&quot;-type movies.

The stoy is so heart wrencing and sad most of the time that I found myself depressed after viewing it! I had to laugh at towards the end though because the surprise of it all, I never thought Tess could do such a thing. And when she told Angel what she did, it all seemed like a joke, almost too corny. But I did cry my eyes out. It is still a very good movie even though the end is strange and most of the story is very dark. I couldn't help but feel the heart breaks as well for both Tess and Angel. Though I wanted to clobber him for his actions, I understood his pain.It is only lacking 1 star in my opinion because the whole movie was acted out so well until the few last scenes.

3593,A3SOV9HFM5H9T1,0767010485,Bruce P. Barten,"[3, 7]","The A&E; home video of Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles captures the dynamics of a triangle involving two men and a young woman attempting to support herself in the world while it presents the triangle of wealth, religion and nobility in an English society in which the blue blood that was associated with wealth in previous centuries flows in the veins of people who are quite ordinary in their current circumstances.  Even worse, Angel Claire, the man from the most religious family, has become a freethinker determined to make his living in the world as a farmer.  Alec, the son of a capitalist family that has adopted an ancient noble name, is such a cad at first that when he is shown preaching to a crowd in a surprising scene in the middle of the story, he is using himself as an example of a despised form of existence, and Tess managed to break away from him by telling him she still felt the same way about him as before:  she was the one who despised him even more than the others.  Alec, however, was still rich and determined to have his way.I appreciated the book more than the video for being so much more explicit about the spiritual conflicts which challenged Angel Claire to go search for land he could farm without being part of the social circumstances of small-town English country life in his own time and place.  The video is perfectly clear about what motivates Tess, but it does not give Angel Claire the opportunity to observe how well her actions coincide with the activities of her royal ancestors.  Alec is superb in admitting how much he lied in order to win Tess, and the steam engines that give the video such an authentic sense of breaking with the horse and buggy existence of prior centuries fit the confession that his family name was originally Stokes.  Of course this is such an old story that sentimental modern viewers hoping for something uplifting ought to hate it like the plague, but I'm sure Thomas Hardy considered that part of its charm.  Two ninety minute videos in which an old woman complains that it is always the young and beautiful who have such problems, never the plain ones, also make this seem like a time of great innocence.",5,This is a story about major problems,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2190,"['A', 'E', 'home', 'video', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'dynamics', 'triangle', 'involving', 'two', 'men', 'young', 'woman', 'attempting', 'support', 'world', 'triangle', 'wealth', 'religion', 'nobility', 'English', 'society', 'blue', 'blood', 'was', 'associated', 'wealth', 'previous', 'centuries', 'veins', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'ordinary', 'current', 'circumstances', 'Even', 'worse', 'Angel', 'Claire', 'man', 'most', 'religious', 'family', 'become', 'freethinker', 'determined', 'make', 'living', 'world', 'farmer', 'Alec', 'son', 'capitalist', 'family', 'adopted', 'ancient', 'noble', 'name', 'such', 'cad', 'first', 'when', 'shown', 'preaching', 'crowd', 'surprising', 'scene', 'middle', 'story', 'using', 'example', 'despised', 'form', 'existence', 'Tess', 'managed', 'break', 'away', 'telling', 'still', 'felt', 'same', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'who', 'despised', 'even', 'more', 'others', 'Alec', 'however', 'was', 'still', 'rich', 'determined', 'have', 'way.I', 'appreciated', 'book', 'more', 'video', 'being', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'explicit', 'spiritual', 'conflicts', 'challenged', 'Angel', 'Claire', 'go', 'search', 'land', 'could', 'farm', 'being', 'part', 'social', 'circumstances', 'small-town', 'English', 'country', 'life', 'own', 'time', 'place', 'video', 'perfectly', 'clear', 'what', 'Tess', 'not', 'give', 'Angel', 'Claire', 'opportunity', 'observe', 'how', 'well', 'actions', 'coincide', 'activities', 'royal', 'ancestors', 'Alec', 'superb', 'admitting', 'how', 'much', 'lied', 'order', 'win', 'Tess', 'steam', 'give', 'video', 'such', 'authentic', 'sense', 'breaking', 'horse', 'buggy', 'existence', 'prior', 'centuries', 'fit', 'confession', 'family', 'name', 'was', 'originally', 'Stokes', 'course', 'such', 'old', 'story', 'sentimental', 'modern', 'viewers', 'hoping', 'something', 'uplifting', 'ought', 'hate', 'plague', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'considered', 'part', 'charm', 'Two', 'ninety', 'minute', 'videos', 'old', 'woman', 'always', 'young', 'beautiful', 'who', 'have', 'such', 'problems', 'never', 'plain', 'ones', 'also', 'make', 'seem', 'time', 'great', 'innocence']",N/A

A powerful story about the true nature of honor and the futileness of running from one's past, &quot;Tess&quot; is no less relevant today than when it was written over one hundred years ago.Justine Waddell stars as Tess Durbyfield, an innocent country girl who goes to live with wealthy relatives. After becoming pregnant by her rakish cousin (well played by the smirking Jason Flemyng) and then losing her baby, she attempts to embark on a new life with the upright Angel Claire (gorgeous Oliver Milburn). Fate, however, has no intention of letting her off the hook.Great performances (especially by Milburn, in a tricky role), lush photography and good production values make this well worth checking out.

3596,A1T17LMQABMBN5,0767010485,CoffeeGurl,"[8, 8]","When I first read Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, I was amazed that a nineteenth century male writer would write about a ""fallen woman"" in such a touching, sympathetic light.  In fact, publishers refused to release the novel at first because of its blatant contempt to the unfairness of women like the heroine in the story.  Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one dark novel and I wondered how the A&E; miniseries would be like.  This is one of the most wonderful and touching adaptations I have seen!  The film, like the novel, is quite dark and poignant and I was in tears at the end.  Tess Durbeyfield is an innocent sixteen-year-old struggling to survive with her impoverished family.  When they discover that they are the poor relations of a wealthy family, the D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent away to work for them.  There she meets the handsome scoundrel Alec D'Urberville, who, under false pretenses, seduces the naive young woman.  (Well, some may call it seduction, but I call it rape.)  She refuses to carry on as his mistress, so she goes back to her family, but her struggles have just begun.  She has Alec's baby, but the infant dies.  Starting over, Tess moves to a farm, where she meets Angel Clare, an attractive and respectable son of a clergyman.  They fall in love and get married, but he soon abandons her after she confesses her ""sin.""  There Tess's struggles for survival truly begin and she is forced to make some ill-fated decisions that lead to tragedy.Justine Wardell (Wives and Daughters, Mansfield Park) delivers a powerful and poignant performance and brings this strong, albeit tragic heroine to life in more ways than one.  She transmits so many emotions that I was truly moved to the core.  I couldn't have pictured a better actress for this role.  Jason Flemyng is also wonderful as the villainous Alec D'Urberville.  His performance is quite in-depth and credible.  No cardboard villain resides in this actor!  In fact, his love for Tess seems sincere, offering marriage and to care for her once she tells him everything she's been through.  Alec does some vile things, but I feel that he is sincere in his way.  Angel, on the other hand, is truly hateful.  He is for the most part responsible for everything that happens to Tess after they are married.  His unwillingness to start a life with Tess because she is ""damaged goods"" is difficult to stomach.  Kudos to Oliver Milburn for his wonderful acting.  The adaptation is amazing.  Thomas Hardy did a wonderful job in showing a more compassionate side of a fallen woman.  That is why I have always been amazed that a nineteenth century man had written such a novel.  The screenwriter, Ted Whitehead, has kept Hardy's vision alive with this vivid adaptation.

3602,A2MRZPTMYFADUV,0767010485,Frodo,"[6, 7]","The loss of one's pride while the accentuation of one's innocence is the irony that made ""Tess of the D'Urbivilles"" one of the boldest and most honest novels to come out of the 19th century. Thomas Hardy's novel about a girl who is disgraced by the society that destroyed her is compelling and controversal, and in my eyes, difficult to transport onto the screen. Yet somehow, this adaptation of the Hardy classic, though different in some ways, is successful in bringing out the travesty, tragedy, and short-lived passion of a girl whose pride is ripped away from her bit by bit, yet through it all remains pure and innocent.Justine Waddell was so captivating as Tess, embodying all the sadness and diminishing hope of her character. I was particularly impressed how as the film progressed, (especially in the final half-hour or so), Tess's once bright and accepting outlook on life turns dead, replaced by bitterness and dismay. Waddell did a clever job in portraying these opposite traits with subtlety and care.Olvier Milbern was a good choice for Angel Clare. I liked how his physical presence stepped somewhat outside the stereotype of other men at that time. Conventional slicked back hair and spotless suits were replaced by a slight grubby, rebellious twist. This was good in bringing out Angel's emotional removal from normal 19th Century society. It was a simple, yet successful element.I did not, however, care for Jason Flemyng's portrayal of the dislikable Alec, whose very exploitment of Tess is the reason for her terrible downfall. I thought Flemyng's performance was laboured and weak, and he did not blend well into his character's shoes at all. Generally, I thought his acting was poor, which is rather unusual for him.That aside, for me, the film's greatest part was the heartbreaking final scene at Stonehenge. Broken and disgraced (not to mention a fugitive) Tess spends her final happy, passionate hours with Angel on the quiet dark hills next to the ancient ruins. This scene moved me greatly. The presence of the stones  represented her family's distant connection to an ancient lineage. Angel's redeemed love for her, dispite everyting, is the most precious gift Tess could ever receive. But fate it seems is unsympathetic, and her dark past traps her once and for all. It's just so sad.So, I was really impressed with this film. The scenery and bittersweet musical theme added extra essence to this great adaptation of Thomas Hardy's original story. As the film's bright opening progresses towards its climactic and heartbreaking end, we are forever reminded of a girl who lost everything to Fate... except her innocence.",4,The heartwrenching story of a girl whose true enemy was fate.,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",2006,2649,"['loss', 'one', 'pride', 'accentuation', 'one', 'innocence', 'irony', 'made', 'Tess', ""D'Urbivilles"", 'one', 'boldest', 'most', 'honest', 'novels', 'come', '19th', 'century', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'girl', 'who', 'disgraced', 'society', 'destroyed', 'compelling', 'controversal', 'eyes', 'difficult', 'transport', 'screen', 'somehow', 'adaptation', 'Hardy', 'classic', 'though', 'different', 'ways', 'successful', 'bringing', 'out', 'travesty', 'tragedy', 'short-lived', 'passion', 'girl', 'pride', 'ripped', 'away', 'bit', 'bit', 'yet', 'pure', 'innocent.Justine', 'Waddell', 'was', 'so', 'captivating', 'Tess', 'embodying', 'sadness', 'diminishing', 'hope', 'character', 'was', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'how', 'film', 'progressed', 'especially', 'final', 'half-hour', 'so', 'Tess', 'once', 'bright', 'accepting', 'outlook', 'life', 'turns', 'dead', 'replaced', 'bitterness', 'dismay', 'Waddell', 'did', 'clever', 'job', 'portraying', 'opposite', 'traits', 'subtlety', 'care.Olvier', 'Milbern', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'Angel', 'Clare', 'liked', 'how', 'physical', 'presence', 'stepped', 'somewhat', 'stereotype', 'other', 'men', 'time', 'Conventional', 'slicked', 'back', 'hair', 'spotless', 'suits', 'were', 'replaced', 'slight', 'grubby', 'rebellious', 'twist', 'was', 'good', 'bringing', 'out', 'Angel', 'emotional', 'removal', 'normal', '19th', 'Century', 'society', 'was', 'simple', 'yet', 'successful', 'element.I', 'did', 'not', 'however', 'care', 'Jason', 'Flemyng', 'portrayal', 'dislikable', 'Alec', 'very', 'exploitment', 'Tess', 'reason', 'terrible', 'downfall', 'thought', 'Flemyng', 'performance', 'was', 'laboured', 'weak', 'did', 'not', 'blend', 'well', 'character', 'shoes', 'Generally', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'poor', 'rather', 'unusual', 'aside', 'film', 'greatest', 'part', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'final', 'scene', 'Stonehenge', 'Broken', 'disgraced', 'not', 'mention', 'fugitive', 'Tess', 'final', 'happy', 'passionate', 'hours', 'Angel', 'quiet', 'dark', 'hills', 'ancient', 'scene', 'moved', 'greatly', 'presence', 'stones', 'represented', 'family', 'distant', 'connection', 'ancient', 'lineage', 'Angel', 'redeemed', 'love', 'dispite', 'everyting', 'most', 'precious', 'gift', 'Tess', 'could', 'ever', 'receive', 'fate', 'unsympathetic', 'dark', 'past', 'once', 'just', 'so', 'sad.So', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'film', 'scenery', 'bittersweet', 'musical', 'theme', 'added', 'extra', 'essence', 'great', 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'bright', 'opening', 'climactic', 'heartbreaking', 'end', 'are', 'forever', 'reminded', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'Fate', 'innocence']",N/A

Likewise, the families with aristocratic names don't necessarily stand as pillars to the community.  The question of the legitimacy of names is also brought up.The other idea is the plight of women in the 18th and 19th centuries.  What could they do?

We never read the book for that class, but I read it soon after, and I believe this adaptation is mostly faithful.!!SPOILERS!!Tess is my favorite Hardy novel next to The Return of the Native. Justine Waddell's performance is excellent, as she truly embodied ""innocence"" transformed into a suicidal, cold woman, no longer caring about her future because of the men who betrayed and ruined her.I hated Alec, naturally, but I hated Angel even more in some ways.  What a hypocrite, telling Tess that he couldn't love her, didn't want to see her anymore because he was only in love with her purity, and she wasn't really pure. Never mind that the rape wasn't her fault - ""You were more sinned against"" he admitted, though he still wouldn't accept her.And I definitely considered it rape, not consensual sex/seduction (Tess admitting that she had some ""feelings"" for Alec didn't make it consensual). Makes me sick, especially since he wasn't pure either. The wretched double standard rears its ugly head yet again.  Anyway, I'm inclined to believe that Angel would have rejected her even if it had been a totally brutal rape with no feelings/attraction involved.  She was damaged goods in Angel's eyes, and it's tragic that this sort of thing still goes on today.I always enjoy the atmosphere at the end of the movie...the colors, the mood. Tess seems a bit psychotic, complete with the glazed eyes, wandering around in her nightgown repeating, ""It's too late.""  And a bit later, having changed into a gorgeous dark blue dress, she walks quickly through a quiet, wealthy town by the sea - Sandbourne.  With sounds of seagulls, so tranquil despite the characters' turmoil.By the final scene, I hate Angel more than ever. He could have prevented so much if he'd loved her completely, as a husband should. She had no other choice but allow Alec to take over the role of supportive husband, to deliver her family from poverty.And so it appears that there are two villains to this story. One appeared too early in Tess' life - the other, too late.",5,"""And there I met a man named Alec...Alec D'Urberville...""",1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,2168,"['became', 'obsessed', 'movie', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'watched', 'English', 'class', 'took', 'entire', 'week', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'class', 'read', 'soon', 'believe', 'adaptation', 'mostly', 'faithful.', 'SPOILERS', 'Tess', 'favorite', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'Return', 'Native', 'Justine', 'Waddell', 'performance', 'excellent', 'truly', 'embodied', 'innocence', 'transformed', 'suicidal', 'cold', 'woman', 'no', 'longer', 'caring', 'future', 'men', 'who', 'betrayed', 'ruined', 'her.I', 'hated', 'Alec', 'naturally', 'hated', 'Angel', 'even', 'more', 'ways', 'What', 'hypocrite', 'telling', 'Tess', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'anymore', 'was', 'only', 'love', 'purity', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'pure', 'Never', 'mind', 'rape', 'was', ""n't"", 'fault', 'were', 'more', 'sinned', 'admitted', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'accept', 'her.And', 'definitely', 'considered', 'rape', 'not', 'consensual', 'sex/seduction', 'Tess', 'admitting', 'had', 'feelings', 'Alec', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'consensual', 'Makes', 'sick', 'especially', 'was', ""n't"", 'pure', 'either', 'wretched', 'double', 'standard', 'ugly', 'head', 'yet', 'again', 'Anyway', ""'m"", 'inclined', 'believe', 'Angel', 'would', 'have', 'rejected', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'totally', 'brutal', 'rape', 'feelings/attraction', 'involved', 'was', 'damaged', 'goods', 'Angel', 'eyes', 'tragic', 'sort', 'thing', 'still', 'today.I', 'always', 'enjoy', 'atmosphere', 'end', 'movie', 'colors', 'mood', 'Tess', 'bit', 'psychotic', 'complete', 'glazed', 'eyes', 'wandering', 'around', 'nightgown', 'repeating', 'too', 'late', 'bit', 'later', 'having', 'changed', 'gorgeous', 'dark', 'blue', 'dress', 'walks', 'quickly', 'quiet', 'wealthy', 'town', 'sea', 'Sandbourne', 'sounds', 'seagulls', 'so', 'tranquil', 'characters', 'turmoil.By', 'final', 'scene', 'hate', 'Angel', 'more', 'ever', 'could', 'have', 'prevented', 'so', 'much', ""'d"", 'loved', 'completely', 'husband', 'should', 'had', 'other', 'choice', 'allow', 'Alec', 'take', 'over', 'role', 'supportive', 'husband', 'deliver', 'family', 'poverty.And', 'are', 'two', 'villains', 'story', 'One', 'appeared', 'too', 'early', 'Tess', 'life', 'other', 'too', 'late']",N/A

Less haunting than the 1979 version of Tess, this one is more lighthearted and energetic. I often liked the spirited temper and playful flirtatiousness of Tess in this film, and I liked the emphasis on Angel's jealousy after Tess has confessed her former affair to him. Plus, this Tess is divinely beautiful - anyone could see why she captures the heart of every man she meets. What I didn't like was the fact that this version seemed to clarify all the characters' thoughts and feelings, instead of leaving it subtle and ambiguous as the '79 film does. I prefer it when you get to decide for yourself what Tess is feeling. Also, I felt that the narrator in this version was unnecessary, and (as is too often the case nowadays) the love scenes were rather unattractive. Too many actors and actresses have forgotten how to infuse passion into their kissing. The love scenes were more romantic in the 1979 film.I still find this production enjoyable for its spirit, though, and Tess is wonderful to look at.

3622,A1Q1V4F9610DB5,0767010485,Music Lover in Omaha,"[4, 5]","There was some terrific acting in this mini series, specifically from Justine Waddell, Jason Flyming and Oliver MIlburn.  This film has a dark ending, but the production itself is not.  There are many light moments to overcome the tragedy that is unfolding.  Tess is a traveller on a road towards her inevitable fate, a fate that seems typical of Thomas Hardy.  Much like Antigone in the play, once the clock is wound and events are set in motion, the outcome becomes unavoidable.  Justine Waddell as Tess is beautiful as a sixteen year old and even more so four years later, but when she is forced to do hard labor to earn a living, she has the mannerisms, the walk and the talk of a laborer who is worn down by the grind.  As the charming Angel, Oliver Milburn is pleasant and then downright disgusting in his betrayal of Tess.  The actor did a great job as the loving courter and then the creep that rejected her.  Then he came back after he decided he could forgive her.  Even though it was kind of cute, I was thinking:  What a jerk.  He's forgiving her after all she went through!  Even in the end when he was trying to finally be the loving husband that he should have been to begin with, I couldn't forgive him.  I felt that it was only the now twisted mind of Tess that allowed her to forgive him.  And there was Jason Flemying as Alec, the D'eurberville that wasn't.  He loved Tess in his own way, she declared. Well he did.  This guy went above and beyond the call of duty to love and care for Tess, but she would not love him.  Yes, he did rape her, and he never knew the consequences until it was too late.  For Tess, much that people did to right their wrongs was 'too late'.  I did not find this DVD to be depressing.  It was vintage Hardy and very well done.  Also, I did not see this as a romance at all.  This was a tragedy to be played out.  I was also impressed by the work scenes, in the fowl farm and later in part 2 on the farm where Tess was working.  Very depressing working conditions that demonstrated how far the lady had fallen.

I have to say that Jason Flemying and Leigh Lawson each did an outstanding job as the rakish Alec D'Urberville, the lazy, dissolute man who takes advantage of the innocent Tess. Justine Waddell makes a strong yet sensitive Tess, who refuses to marry a man that she does not love for the sake of reputation and financial security. The tragedies that befall her are blamed on her by the hypocritical, sexually repressed society that corrupted and used her in the first place. The agony that she feels over Angel's double-standards toward her past shows us how much things have changed in our society (although not in some countries) and the sexist and chauvinistic attitudes that still plague people today.

While he celebrates his good fortune, his daughter dances in her creamy dress with her friends wearing lace shawls and bonnets. There is a sense of peace and happiness in a secluded part of the world. A place you never imagine could foster such exquisite pain.Tess (Justine Waddell) seems reticent and reluctant. She is torn between her responsibility to her family and finding her own happiness. In harsh times, she chooses to try her best at finding support for her family.In her reluctance, she casts a mysterious spell about herself and this seems to make her irresistible. Riding alone with a handsome man in a mysterious forest seems a fantasy at first. Then, when she draws the wrong man to her inner circle and he takes her by force, we doubt she will be able to love again. Once her mother releases her into this wolf's forest, she is never safe again. His love is damaging to her in all the worst ways.Not only does she become pregnant, her child dies and she must now carry this secret with her to her grave or be shunned by men who are more understanding of their own lusts, than of her forced submission after only a casual dalliance. Since she doesn't love Alec (Jason Flemying), she decides not to marry him. Although, if she did marry him, she could have lived in a beautiful Victorian mansion complete with wood floors and ferns in planters on pedestals. She is offered wealth again and again.I love this movie for so many reason. Not only can you escape to the English countryside, there are beautiful scenes of family life by fireplaces and country life on farms. Milk sloshes in wooden buckets and milkmaids are still innocent enough to cry when kissed.Just when we think Tess is safe, she falls in love with Angel Clare (Oliver Milburn). He sees her as a goddess, perhaps Demeter. Little does he know how true his words are, as Demeter was the goddess of fertility and was also raped. They played with this idea throughout the movie in subtle ways. Tess is seen holding grain, she is very fertile and she is raped. Through Tess' experiences with suffering and grief, she learns to empathize with others and eventually almost sacrifices her body for the love of her family.Then, her past comes back to haunt her in the worst ways. This is tragedy at its best, if there is such an idea. I loved this adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel. However, I kept waiting for scenes I'd thought I'd seen before. Then, I realized I had mistaken this movie for Roman Polanski's 1980 adaptation. Both movies are excellent and will keep your attention right to the last second. Now I have a good excuse to watch  ""Tess."" If you love comparing adaptations, it is well worth the extra time.Incredible acting, gorgeous scenery and a tragedy with so much irony and drama, you can't believe anyone could have luck this bad. Or was it just decisions the characters made in the direction of their own tragic ends? Should Tess have followed her heart to begin with and would that have made all the difference? Should you really tell your lover all your faults on your wedding night? This movie is not only stunning in its beauty, it also makes you think on a deeper level about a number of situations and how you would deal with them if you were Tess.One of the most compelling tragedies I've ever seen and I'm happy to say I enjoyed this adaptation as much as the 1980 version. Both are almost three hours in length.

3628,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,0767010485,Robin Simmons,"[2, 2]","Set in the bleak background of Victorian England, TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES is a brilliant BBC adaption of Thomas Hardy's 1881 novel about a teenager trapped between two men: one is an ordinary man who offers happiness, the other is a scheming aristocrat who offers wealth.  Unlike Roman Polanski's fine 1980 feature film starring Natassja Kinski, this version adhere's closer to the substance of Hardy's text.  Justine Waddell gives Tess a teen attitude that rings true.  Violated by one man and forsaken by another, she refuses to remain a victim. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; captures the harsh realism and poignant beauty of a true literary masterpiece.

3629,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,0767010485,taaj,"[1, 1]","""Tess"" starts out with an innocent dance in a field. That's probably the last bit of innocence in the entire film. It just gets darker and darker from there. Life for the poor in England was hard then. Realism demands that it show the darkness, and this film doesn't hold back in that regard. There are ups and downs. Family relationships are complex. Courtship is realistically complicated. The scenery is both gorgeous and horrible (""horrible"" because it graphically captures the back breaking labor of farm life). Emotions, love, hardship, obligation, honor, and immaturity result in some bizarre choices, but it does make for an interesting viewing. It's hard to know how to feel at the end of the ride because it's all so complex, but it is an interesting story.
