942931,A1B53UQIMZHOVN,B000BITUYI,Anthony Caton,"[17, 18]","If only ""Gunsmoke, Volumes I and II"" would have been a complete season set.  The edition pales in comparison to the recent complete season sets of ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" and ""Wanted: Dead or Alive.""  In the aforementioned compilations, all 39 shows per season were included.  Also, so many quality episodes of ""Gunsmoke"" were left out.  With super characters actors such as R.G. Armstrong, Morgan Woodward, Pat Hingle, L.Q. Jones, Steve Forrest, and Dabbs Greer still very much around, it would have been great to hear their comments on the many episodes they were involved in.  In fact, Woodward, now living in the Dallas area, appeared in a record 19 ""Gunsmoke"" programs.  He even taught Jim Arness how to fly an airplane.  Hingle took Milburn Stone's place as town doctor for an entire season while Stone recovered from a heart attack.  Veteran heavy Leo Gordon, who died just recently, could have no doubt given some interesting feedback while this set was being put together on the first ""Gunsmoke"" actually filmed, ""Hack Prine.""  As it stands, the episodes included are in good shape with fine audio and video quality.  However, the various features included are all out of sync audio-wise -- there is almost a second delay in the dialogue.  The best clip is of Jim Arness appearing on the Ed Sullivan Show.  Arness, all 6'7 of him, towers over poor Ed.  I'm glad I purchased this set, but it honestly could have been so much more.  Hopefully complete season sets will be issued in the near future.",3,An Old Friend Revisited,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,1505,"['only', 'Gunsmoke', 'Volumes', 'II', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'complete', 'season', 'set', 'edition', 'pales', 'comparison', 'recent', 'complete', 'season', 'sets', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Wanted', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'aforementioned', 'compilations', '39', 'shows', 'season', 'were', 'included', 'Also', 'so', 'many', 'quality', 'episodes', 'Gunsmoke', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'super', 'characters', 'actors', 'such', 'R.G', 'Armstrong', 'Morgan', 'Woodward', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'L.Q', 'Jones', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'Dabbs', 'Greer', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'hear', 'comments', 'many', 'episodes', 'were', 'involved', 'fact', 'Woodward', 'now', 'living', 'Dallas', 'area', 'appeared', 'record', '19', 'Gunsmoke', 'programs', 'even', 'taught', 'Jim', 'Arness', 'how', 'fly', 'airplane', 'Hingle', 'took', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'place', 'town', 'doctor', 'entire', 'season', 'Stone', 'recovered', 'heart', 'attack', 'Veteran', 'heavy', 'Leo', 'Gordon', 'who', 'died', 'just', 'recently', 'could', 'have', 'doubt', 'given', 'interesting', 'feedback', 'set', 'was', 'being', 'put', 'together', 'first', 'Gunsmoke', 'actually', 'filmed', 'Hack', 'Prine', 'episodes', 'included', 'are', 'good', 'shape', 'fine', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'However', 'various', 'features', 'included', 'are', 'sync', 'audio-wise', 'almost', 'second', 'delay', 'dialogue', 'best', 'clip', 'Jim', 'Arness', 'appearing', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'Show', 'Arness', '6', '7', 'towers', 'poor', 'Ed', ""'m"", 'glad', 'purchased', 'set', 'honestly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Hopefully', 'complete', 'season', 'sets', 'will', 'be', 'issued', 'near', 'future']","Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection, Volumes 1 & 2"

942934,A29QA79VLQGHY6,B000BITUYI,Flipper Campbell,"[5, 6]","Before ""Gunsmoke"" became a comfy institution, it fought hard for its TV turf. The show's dramatic early success often is credited to its adult subject matter, unheard of in TV Westerns of the early 1950s. (The series ""is honest, it's adult, it's realistic,"" the Duke cautioned the first episode's audience.)""Gunsmoke"" writers such as Sam Peckinpah and series co-creator John Meston had the freedom to tell tales of rape, slavery, thrill kills, child abuse and, of course, prostitution. A long way from Zorro and the Lone Ranger. This is the side of ""Gunsmoke"" a lot of people haven't seen, and it's on display here in volume 1.Paramount's new sets -- by far the best ""Gunsmoke"" product out there -- go for the star power. DVD producer Paul Brownstein corralled episodes with such guest stars as Charles Bronson, Jon Voight, Richard Chamberlain, John Drew Barrymore, Leonard Nimoy, Kurt Russell and Jodie Foster.The all-star approach yields a tree-ring view that wouldn't have been possible with greatest-hits collections. Some shows are definitely weaker than others, usually coinciding with one of the series' format changes. The writers, for example, didn't know what to do with all that extra time when the show went from 30 minutes to 60. There are plenty of terrific episodes, though, including star James Arness' favorites ""Chato"" (with Ricardo Montalban as a renegade Apache) and the charming comedy ""A Quiet Day in Dodge.""Images range from excellent to barely passable. The black-and-white shows look a bit flat but are solid overall; there's surprisingly little wear, considering. Check out the noir-influenced lighting that revealed the evils of Dodge City after dark.The color episodes from the mid-'60s show their age; two are borderline unwatchable. One of the stranger shows (""The Jailer"") feels like one of those old 3-D demos, with the actors dressed in bright colors and garish makeup -- like Fellini characters -- to demonstrate TV's new color palette. A bizarre performance by Bette Davis (highlighted by her blue eyes and green teeth) completes the experience. The DVDs' mono audio gets the job done -- dialog is clear, gunshots sharp.The DVD sets' 11 commentaries include talks from guest stars Angie Dickinson, George Kennedy, Ed Asner and Bruce Dern. Arness, 82, provides two rewarding commentaries as well as short introductions to all of the episodes. Dennis Weaver (Chester) and Buck Taylor (Newly) also do talks. (Cast ""family members"" Amanda Blake, Milburn Stone (Doc) and Ken Curtis (Festus) all died before the DVD era.)The generous collection of extras are spread about the six discs. Most are short, upbeat and nostalgic. Among the more interesting bits are two 1970s talk show appearances with Blake, who tells Mike Douglas she left the show because she ""couldn't take it anymore ... (being) locked in this saloon all these years."" A panel discussion with Blake and Arness was filmed in the year of her death, showing the actress frail and still ready to rumble. The sets lack a strong ""Gunsmoke"" documentary, a real missed opportunity.(Interesting how Amazon spotlights reviews from people who haven't seen the product. This is far from a ""tossed together"" project. Buy with confidence.)",4,"On target, mostly",1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3221,"['Gunsmoke', 'became', 'comfy', 'institution', 'fought', 'hard', 'TV', 'turf', 'show', 'dramatic', 'early', 'success', 'often', 'credited', 'adult', 'subject', 'matter', 'unheard', 'TV', 'Westerns', 'early', '1950s', 'series', 'honest', 'adult', 'realistic', 'Duke', 'cautioned', 'first', 'episode', 'audience', 'Gunsmoke', 'writers', 'such', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'series', 'co-creator', 'John', 'Meston', 'had', 'freedom', 'tell', 'tales', 'rape', 'slavery', 'thrill', 'kills', 'child', 'abuse', 'course', 'prostitution', 'long', 'way', 'Zorro', 'Lone', 'Ranger', 'side', 'Gunsmoke', 'lot', 'people', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'display', 'here', 'volume', '1.Paramount', 'new', 'sets', 'far', 'best', 'Gunsmoke', 'product', 'there', 'go', 'star', 'power', 'DVD', 'producer', 'Paul', 'Brownstein', 'corralled', 'episodes', 'such', 'guest', 'stars', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'Jon', 'Voight', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'John', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Jodie', 'Foster.The', 'all-star', 'approach', 'yields', 'tree-ring', 'view', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'greatest-hits', 'collections', 'shows', 'are', 'definitely', 'weaker', 'others', 'usually', 'coinciding', 'one', 'series', 'format', 'changes', 'writers', 'example', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'extra', 'time', 'when', 'show', 'went', '30', 'minutes', '60', 'are', 'plenty', 'terrific', 'episodes', 'though', 'including', 'star', 'James', 'Arness', 'favorites', 'Chato', 'Ricardo', 'Montalban', 'renegade', 'Apache', 'charming', 'comedy', 'Quiet', 'Day', 'Dodge', 'Images', 'range', 'excellent', 'barely', 'passable', 'black-and-white', 'shows', 'look', 'bit', 'flat', 'are', 'solid', 'overall', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'wear', 'considering', 'Check', 'out', 'noir-influenced', 'lighting', 'revealed', 'evils', 'Dodge', 'City', 'dark.The', 'color', 'episodes', ""mid-'60s"", 'show', 'age', 'two', 'are', 'borderline', 'unwatchable', 'One', 'stranger', 'Jailer', 'feels', 'one', 'old', '3-D', 'demos', 'actors', 'dressed', 'bright', 'colors', 'garish', 'makeup', 'Fellini', 'characters', 'demonstrate', 'TV', 'new', 'color', 'palette', 'bizarre', 'performance', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'highlighted', 'blue', 'eyes', 'green', 'teeth', 'experience', 'DVDs', 'mono', 'audio', 'job', 'done', 'dialog', 'clear', 'gunshots', 'sharp.The', 'DVD', 'sets', '11', 'commentaries', 'include', 'talks', 'guest', 'stars', 'Angie', 'Dickinson', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Arness', '82', 'two', 'rewarding', 'commentaries', 'as', 'well', 'short', 'introductions', 'episodes', 'Dennis', 'Weaver', 'Chester', 'Buck', 'Taylor', 'Newly', 'also', 'do', 'talks', 'family', 'members', 'Amanda', 'Blake', 'Milburn', 'Stone', 'Doc', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Festus', 'died', 'DVD', 'era', 'generous', 'collection', 'extras', 'are', 'spread', 'six', 'discs', 'Most', 'are', 'short', 'upbeat', 'nostalgic', 'more', 'interesting', 'bits', 'are', 'two', '1970s', 'talk', 'show', 'Blake', 'who', 'Mike', 'Douglas', 'left', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'anymore', 'being', 'locked', 'saloon', 'years', 'panel', 'discussion', 'Blake', 'Arness', 'was', 'filmed', 'year', 'death', 'showing', 'actress', 'frail', 'still', 'ready', 'rumble', 'sets', 'lack', 'strong', 'Gunsmoke', 'documentary', 'real', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'Interesting', 'how', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'product', 'far', 'tossed', 'together', 'project', 'Buy', 'confidence']","Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection, Volumes 1 & 2"

942936,A1HD5KASZ7F36S,B000BITUYI,History Man,"[92, 96]","Since a number of truly mediocre TV series have been released in complete season DVD sets, it boggles the mind to see that ""Gunsmoke,"" the longest running drama in TV history, has gotten comparatively shabby treatment.  Here we have a mish-mash of episodes from the show's various eras that have mostly been selected because of ""big name"" guest stars that appeared in them, not because they are the best in the series' 20-year run.  If CBS wanted to issue a ""selected episodes"" collection, they should have used better criteria than guest stars (some of whom aren't all that ""big"" anyway, including Angie Dickinson, Richard Chamberlain, Leonard Nimoy, Adam West, et al).  Moreover, most of these epiosodes have been issued on home video before.Perhaps it is asking too much for CBS to issue the entire series on DVD, consisting of some 635 episodes (although they already have issued the first 3 1/2 seasons on 20 DVDs through their video club), but there are a number of better alternatives than this half-hearted effort.  They could issue DVDs with the best episodes of each season, or sets with the best of the show's several eras (half-hour and one-hour black and white shows, and one-hour color episodes), or entire seasons one at a time to see how well they do in the market place (they have already done 3 seasons worth of ""Have Gun - Will Travel"" this way).Since this set is all that ""Gunsmoke"" fans are likely to get for some time, it will have to do (and is better than nothing; there are, after all, some interesting special features included).  Whether or not it is worth the asking price may depend on how many of the episodes you already have in your collection.

942947,A233SZIWYJFSNN,B000BITUYI,Timothy P. Molthan,"[2, 4]","While I understand people wanting season sets and all (and now they're getting them), the company was probably releasing collections like this to ""test the waters"" to make sure there was enough interest to warrant season sets. Apparently, there was. One of the great things about this set is it lets you track the evolution of the show, and could be a good guide to which season sets you might be interested in. For me, the later, hour-long episodes are better (I thought the opposite would be true). I had never seen any of the black and whites before...they are good, but the really early ones (half-hour) don't have much appeal to me. In the hour-long shows, even the black and white ones, they wrap up the ending with Matt and the person he saved or was gunning for, have a ""moment"" which really helps the show. Until the final black and white season, that great, familiar theme music also is not there...well, maybe a plodding version of it. That may seem like a nuance, but I think it's important. This set only includes a couple of episodes with Burt Reynolds as Quint Asper. I would like to have at least one more, he was very good in the role. But overall, this is a nice collection. It is overpriced (nearly $2 per episode) for an old show, but a fun splurge. If coupled with the Director's Collection, that probably fills in some holes too. I'm thinking about buying that too, although I'll probably skip the First Season set. This is one of those shows they should have started releasing season sets in the middle then work their way out in both directions, since the middle of the series seems to hold the most interest. ADDITIONAL INFO: With the switch to color episodes in this set (the ""syndicated"" or ""TV Land"" episodes), it appears that most of them are taken from videotape copies rather than going back to the original film elements. I didn't notice it on my old TV, but since I switched to HD, it's very apparent. While the black and whites are really clear, the color episodes are comparatively fuzzy, and at least one has garbled sound (the William Shatner episode). There are also abrupt fade-ins and fade-outs on at least one,which the original films wouldn't have had (but TV Land does). Still nice to have, but HD reveals a lot of problems that shouldn't be present.",4,Glad I got this,1184284800,"07 13, 2007",2007,2293,"['understand', 'people', 'wanting', 'season', 'sets', 'now', ""'re"", 'getting', 'company', 'was', 'probably', 'releasing', 'collections', 'test', 'waters', 'make', 'sure', 'was', 'enough', 'interest', 'warrant', 'season', 'sets', 'Apparently', 'was', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'set', 'track', 'evolution', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'guide', 'season', 'sets', 'might', 'be', 'interested', 'later', 'hour-long', 'episodes', 'are', 'better', 'thought', 'opposite', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'black', 'whites', 'are', 'good', 'really', 'early', 'ones', 'half-hour', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'appeal', 'hour-long', 'shows', 'even', 'black', 'white', 'ones', 'wrap', 'up', 'ending', 'Matt', 'person', 'saved', 'was', 'gunning', 'have', 'moment', 'really', 'show', 'final', 'black', 'white', 'season', 'great', 'familiar', 'theme', 'music', 'also', 'not', 'well', 'maybe', 'plodding', 'version', 'may', 'seem', 'nuance', 'think', 'important', 'set', 'only', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Quint', 'Asper', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'role', 'overall', 'nice', 'collection', 'overpriced', 'nearly', '2', 'episode', 'old', 'show', 'fun', 'splurge', 'coupled', 'Director', 'Collection', 'probably', 'holes', 'too', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'buying', 'too', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'skip', 'First', 'Season', 'set', 'one', 'shows', 'should', 'have', 'started', 'releasing', 'season', 'sets', 'middle', 'then', 'work', 'way', 'directions', 'middle', 'series', 'hold', 'most', 'interest', 'ADDITIONAL', 'INFO', 'switch', 'color', 'episodes', 'set', 'syndicated', 'TV', 'Land', 'episodes', 'most', 'are', 'taken', 'videotape', 'copies', 'rather', 'going', 'back', 'original', 'film', 'elements', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'old', 'TV', 'switched', 'HD', 'very', 'apparent', 'black', 'whites', 'are', 'really', 'clear', 'color', 'episodes', 'are', 'comparatively', 'fuzzy', 'least', 'one', 'garbled', 'sound', 'William', 'Shatner', 'episode', 'are', 'also', 'abrupt', 'fade-ins', 'fade-outs', 'least', 'one', 'original', 'films', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'TV', 'Land', 'Still', 'nice', 'have', 'HD', 'lot', 'problems', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'present']","Gunsmoke - 50th Anniversary Collection, Volumes 1 & 2"

I think that several releases of this type is the way to go on a show with 633 episodes and 20 seasons. If it was released one season at a time at about 1-2 seasons per year,it would take along time to get into the colour years which are my favorite episodes. If they didn't sell well the production may stop after the first 3 or 4 seasons, which can be had from columbia house anyway. This way we get a sampling from the whole series.The choice of colour episodes could have been better in my opinion. They seemed to be picked by who was in it rather than on a good story line.
