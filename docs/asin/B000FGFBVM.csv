Naomi Judd's Lilly Waite is just the kind of teacher you would want to have had, or would want for your child.  The often under-rated Gerald McRaney is perfect, as are the entire cast.

She has a way of reaching the kids that no one else can reach. Her last thing to do was to put on the school Christmas Pageant.

Darrah Cloud knows how to put together a story with bang-up endings, and this movie with its two story threads has two great endings, back-to-back.But there is some bad news.  Naomi Judd (unless of course you're a fan of hers) is not much of an actress here.  Her scenes look more like a personal appearance, with lines.The daughter is cute and believable.  The uncle is also credible.The love story is totally botched.  The pacing is disjointed.  And there is a lack of motivation.  It is simply not credible, so don't expect to be touched by it.Andy is Andy, and he adds a touch a quality that makes the others look more amateurish than they otherwise would.The rock music (and the absence of Christmas music) was a bit grating.  It was sad that the school kids couldn't relate to any Christmas carols.  They had to have rock.  The raw, harsh tone of the girl singing what were supposed to be Christmas songs was a dischordant note for me.  Others might not be bothered.Still, I say don't miss it.

Andy Griffith + Christmas should = GREAT, but this turned out to be a low budget made for TV snooze fest. We love Andy Griffith and were hoping to add to our annual Christmas viewing list of must watches but we won't be watching this one again. Andy was the main reason we bought this plus the fact that Netflix does not carry it plus it had so many raving reviews and high ratings here on Amazon. Turns out this is boring lame story w/ lousy acting. While it did have a couple of okay moments, this movie could have been so much better. It is hard to pin point. Maybe it was the uninteresting story or the bad script or the reality that Naoimi Judd is not a very good actress or all the little things like the fact that trees in Kentucky don't have leaves in December nor do you drive a convertible in December in Kentucky, just to name a few. My wife kept looking at me while we watched this saying ""this is really cheesy"" and ""why did you buy this""???Andy Griffith fans may want to pass on this one and know that he isn't even the main character. The main actors are Naomi ""Dudd"" and some little angry troubled brat(whose singing voice is not so good). Do buy this if you are a Naomi fan. For everyone else, my advice, save your and money wait for this to come to Netflix(and the drink a lot of coffee; otherwise, you may fall asleep...). My 3 stars rating is being kind.

The seller stated it also went under the title ""A Song for the Season"" which meant nothing to me since I thought I was purchasing the ""A Holiday Season"" pictured in the listing. It came as a surprise when I received ""A Song for the Season"" with a different box cover than the one shown. I shipped it off anyway as a gift and it took 3 viewings before my S-I-L agreed it was the same movie and stopped complaining that I sent her the wrong one. If you think you're getting what's pictured you may be wrong and I wasn't about to pay to return yet another item listed incorrectly or even go through the return process. There should be some way for a seller to advise you if you're not going to get what's pictured... even though the contents may be the same movie. It could go under 12 different titles but when you see the pic on Amazon that's the cover you expect to receive.I also didn't realize the seller would start spamming me with their movie listings nor that there would be religious messages on the back of the cover. Some sellers offer a ""sanitized"" version of movies to meet their standard of acceptance but I really didn't appreciate that not being noted in the seller's comments either. I gave the seller a poor rating but the movie would have been 5 stars had it arrived with the box cover shown and absent the religious messages.",4,You may not get what you see,1257638400,"11 8, 2009",2009,1432,"['purchased', 'gift', 'sister-in-law', 'who', 'pretty', 'picky', 'what', 'seller', 'stated', 'also', 'went', 'title', 'Song', 'Season', 'meant', 'nothing', 'thought', 'was', 'purchasing', 'A', 'Holiday', 'Season', 'pictured', 'listing', 'came', 'surprise', 'when', 'received', 'A', 'Song', 'Season', 'different', 'box', 'cover', 'one', 'shown', 'shipped', 'off', 'anyway', 'gift', 'took', '3', 'viewings', 'S-I-L', 'agreed', 'was', 'same', 'movie', 'stopped', 'complaining', 'sent', 'wrong', 'one', 'think', ""'re"", 'getting', 'what', 'pictured', 'may', 'be', 'wrong', 'was', ""n't"", 'pay', 'return', 'yet', 'item', 'listed', 'incorrectly', 'even', 'go', 'return', 'process', 'should', 'be', 'way', 'seller', 'advise', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'get', 'what', 'pictured', 'even', 'contents', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'movie', 'could', 'go', '12', 'different', 'titles', 'when', 'see', 'pic', 'Amazon', 'cover', 'expect', 'receive.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'seller', 'would', 'start', 'spamming', 'movie', 'listings', 'would', 'be', 'religious', 'messages', 'back', 'cover', 'sellers', 'offer', 'sanitized', 'version', 'movies', 'meet', 'standard', 'acceptance', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'not', 'being', 'noted', 'seller', 'comments', 'gave', 'seller', 'poor', 'rating', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'stars', 'had', 'arrived', 'box', 'cover', 'shown', 'absent', 'religious', 'messages']",A Holiday Romance
