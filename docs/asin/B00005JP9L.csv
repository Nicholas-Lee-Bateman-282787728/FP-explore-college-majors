What comes out of it was what a hairy beast of a political animal our John was well still is as the message still comes through loud and strong. But running side by side is that the land of the free is well, a bit of an oxymoron. The farcical lengths of information gathering/paranoia about what lets' face it was basically politics of pop is ludicrous. But this is the rub. Lennon comes out of this as someone who never lost his street fighting qualities. Some of his messages were naff. Alas if we are all to be judged on every scrap of what we say in our lives-we would all be a bit droll and from time to time, downright stoopid. But most of what he stood for was not naff and unlike some of his musical contemporaries he did put considerable balls on the line to make a point. However, I end up loving the barbed wit, the ability to talk to anyone, debate, disagree and when he sees a fool, to insult. Reminds me of Billy Bragg. This was enjoyable, though provoking and I wonder how much has changed inside America.

646557,AO31JF8HT1ONU,B00005JP9L,"Adam J. Fernandes ""DarkWriter""","[0, 0]","I was three and a half when John Lennon was assasinated so I wasn't old enough to understand the scope of this loss. This documentary brings it into clear focus. I didn't know a lot of the things that he did: the protests, the bed-ins, the concerts, etc. He was an inspiration to all those who fought along with him for peace. I didn't know that he was the one who wrote the immortal song Give Peace a Chance.The problem I have know with celebrities getting involved with charities is something that C.S. Lewis said in The Screwtape letters. Bascially Screwtape said that when the person gets involved in charity he/she should be at the center of the charity, it's his involvement with the charity should be the important thing. The celebrity that goes into the war torn areas in a jeep then goes back to the five-star hotel at night, that kind of thing. I never got that opinion of John Lennon, either from this doc or anything else I've read or seen on him. He was genuinely concerned for the people and the cause he championed. Hell, he risked deportation and arrest for this. He was considered an enemy of the state for these ideas.The documentary is well put together featuring interviews from people who knew and loved John as well as some people who had problems with him including G. Gordon Liddy. But through all of it, John still shines through. He cuts through whatever commentary there is with his own intelligence, extremely quick wit, and absolute sincerity on whatever he's talking about.Oh, and a note about Yoko Ono. My opinion before this doc was simple. I didn't care about her. I didn't believe that she broke up The Beatles, bands break up for more complex reasons than a woman. After seeing this doc I have a more positive feeling about her. She presents an unusual image, but so does Bjork? What's wrong with that? If she was John's muse, his companion, and was the mother of his children, more power to her and God bless her.Where are the voices like this now? Why isn't there a voice like his, or multiple voices for that matter? Why, with better access to information at this time than any other time, is there still a larger sense of apathy in this society.

646558,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JP9L,Alfred Johnson,"[2, 5]","In a recent DVD review of A Tribute to John Lennon, a film that chronicled a concert held in New York City in early October, 2001 in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks, I started the review with the following paragraph:""I am here to rain on this tribute to the work of John Lennon in New York City in early October 2001 on two counts- musically and politically. As to the music. I make no bones about the fact that, as a product of the Generation of '68, I grew to adulthood with this music, however, in any choice between The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, in my book the Stones win hands down. The same applies to comparisons to Lennon as an individual artist. John Lennon could write lyrics with the best of them, no question, but here is the real question- which song, for example, better expresses the sense of working class alienation and, more importantly, what to do about it- Lennon's Working Class Hero or The Stones' Street Fighting Man?'I then went on to detail my militant leftist politics differences with Lennon's essentially pacific, almost childishly nave politics. I stand by those remarks here. Nevertheless, as my headline indicates, in this documentary we are dealing with a different issue that traces the American government's (with who knows what other government's complicity) nefarious persecution of Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono for their brand of radical political activities. In their efforts to avoid deportation all our sympathies are with the Lennons (as they would be for anyone in that situation, cultural icon or not). We do not have to agree on Lennon's ""music is the revolution"" ideas or anything else to know this simple fact- Against one Richard M. Nixon and his cohorts (as represented here by J. Edgar Hoover, various INS officials and, seemingly, G. Gordon Liddy) we are comrades in arms.This somewhat choppily-segmented documentary that is moreover top heavy with `talking heads'  nevertheless does a good job of presenting the progress of John Lennon from the moppet Beatle to somewhat angry working class youth to the Gandhi-like prophet to something like America's Public Enemy Number something as opposition to the Vietnam war escalated. And the American government reacted to Lennon, as it did to others, in its pathological fear of anything left of Billy Graham in the spiritual field (or any field for that matter). This film traces the illegal harassment of the Lennons and their co-workers, his forthright long drawn out legal fight with immigration authorities to avoid deportation and his vindication after several years with the award of permanent resident status.Along the way we get a glimpse back at the various be-in activities conducted by the Lennons, their various attempts at making political connections with other well-known political radicals and their essential political retreat in the face of the American governmental onslaught over their visa status. Add in an all-star cast of those, mainly repentant, radicals on both sides of the Atlantic like Tariq Ali and John Sinclair and you indeed have a trip down memory lane. But here is the kicker- yes, remember John Lennon's visa fight- yes, remember when you take on the American state be ready for any madness, and I mean any madness and, no- do not for a minute believe `music is the revolution"" or other notions presented here. That is the lesson we ultimately learn from this film.",4,In Defense of John Lennon Here,1217376000,"07 30, 2008",2008,3428,"['recent', 'DVD', 'review', 'A', 'Tribute', 'John', 'Lennon', 'film', 'chronicled', 'concert', 'held', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'early', 'October', '2001', 'immediate', 'aftermath', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'started', 'review', 'following', 'paragraph', 'am', 'here', 'rain', 'tribute', 'work', 'John', 'Lennon', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'early', 'October', '2001', 'two', 'counts-', 'musically', 'politically', 'music', 'make', 'bones', 'fact', 'that', 'product', 'Generation', ""'68"", 'grew', 'adulthood', 'music', 'however', 'choice', 'Beatles', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'book', 'Stones', 'win', 'hands', 'down', 'same', 'applies', 'comparisons', 'Lennon', 'individual', 'artist', 'John', 'Lennon', 'could', 'write', 'lyrics', 'best', 'question', 'here', 'real', 'question-', 'song', 'example', 'better', 'sense', 'working', 'class', 'alienation', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'do', 'it-', 'Lennon', 'Working', 'Class', 'Hero', 'Stones', 'Street', 'Fighting', 'Man', 'then', 'went', 'detail', 'militant', 'leftist', 'politics', 'differences', 'Lennon', 'essentially', 'pacific', 'almost', 'childishly', 'nave', 'politics', 'stand', 'remarks', 'here', 'Nevertheless', 'headline', 'documentary', 'are', 'dealing', 'different', 'issue', 'American', 'government', 'who', 'knows', 'what', 'other', 'government', 'complicity', 'nefarious', 'persecution', 'Lennon', 'wife', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'brand', 'radical', 'political', 'activities', 'efforts', 'avoid', 'deportation', 'sympathies', 'are', 'Lennons', 'would', 'be', 'anyone', 'situation', 'cultural', 'icon', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'agree', 'Lennon', 'music', 'revolution', 'ideas', 'anything', 'else', 'know', 'simple', 'fact-', 'Against', 'one', 'Richard', 'M.', 'Nixon', 'cohorts', 'represented', 'here', 'J.', 'Edgar', 'Hoover', 'various', 'INS', 'officials', 'seemingly', 'G.', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'are', 'comrades', 'arms.This', 'somewhat', 'choppily-segmented', 'documentary', 'moreover', 'top', 'heavy', 'talking', 'heads', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'job', 'presenting', 'progress', 'John', 'Lennon', 'moppet', 'Beatle', 'somewhat', 'angry', 'working', 'class', 'youth', 'Gandhi-like', 'prophet', 'something', 'America', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'Number', 'something', 'opposition', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'escalated', 'American', 'government', 'reacted', 'Lennon', 'did', 'others', 'pathological', 'fear', 'anything', 'left', 'Billy', 'Graham', 'spiritual', 'field', 'field', 'matter', 'film', 'illegal', 'harassment', 'Lennons', 'co-workers', 'forthright', 'long', 'drawn', 'out', 'legal', 'fight', 'immigration', 'authorities', 'avoid', 'deportation', 'vindication', 'several', 'years', 'award', 'permanent', 'resident', 'status.Along', 'way', 'get', 'glimpse', 'back', 'various', 'be-in', 'activities', 'conducted', 'Lennons', 'various', 'attempts', 'making', 'political', 'connections', 'other', 'well-known', 'political', 'radicals', 'essential', 'political', 'retreat', 'face', 'American', 'governmental', 'onslaught', 'over', 'visa', 'status', 'Add', 'all-star', 'cast', 'mainly', 'repentant', 'radicals', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'Tariq', 'Ali', 'John', 'Sinclair', 'indeed', 'have', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'here', 'kicker-', 'yes', 'remember', 'John', 'Lennon', 'visa', 'fight-', 'yes', 'remember', 'when', 'take', 'American', 'state', 'be', 'ready', 'madness', 'mean', 'madness', 'no-', 'do', 'not', 'minute', 'believe', 'music', 'revolution', 'other', 'notions', 'presented', 'here', 'lesson', 'ultimately', 'learn', 'film']",N/A

He was a scoundrel; but then such is the price of fame juxtaposed his unique mindset.Geraldo Rivera didn't disappoint, always a fountain of misinformation that began with opening of Al Capone's privacy and followed into this contrivance of so-called truth. Rivera plays with Mrs. Lennon her chosen fantasy; that John Lennon was a dupe to the evil Jerry Rubin and Abby Hoffman. Hardly. Lennon was nobody's dupe. He was genius incarnate. The three together were a splendid package and very well threatened the good old U.S. of A. Crazy how Mrs. Lennon continues the motherly defense of her large economy son...but then such is surrogate mother's love.Get the movie, dream, and know what John Lennon did, brought forth the gun; so much for The United States' purported freedom of speech and all other freedoms.Side note: Rubin was mysteriously hit by a car and Hoffman was diagnosed with a drug overdose; both easy boondoggles.

646560,A3GUZIX0ITZORF,B00005JP9L,applewood,"[2, 2]","I checked out this fine documentary from the library yesterday to help commemorate the 30th anniversary of Lennon's murder, and found it better than I though - a passionate and revealing look into the public/private/performance life of John and Yoko, as well as a glimpse under the curtain to the ugly ankles of the Great Wizards of the 60's &70's (Johnson and Nixon).Beginning with Lennon's troubled youth (basically orphaned) and through the formative ""mop-head"" Beatles phase to the turning point of meeting Yoko and experiencing the breakdown of American order first hand (the unpopular Vietnam war, political assassinations and protests, and the violence of the '68 Democratic Convention), and befriending of radical activists (Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale), we see Lennon, always the rebel, mature into a counter-culture hero, realizing his global media power and using it to do good (promote peace, fight war and injustice), and then being cut down at just 40 years of age...This documentary makes little attempt to be balanced and reasonable or show the darker side of the 60's idealism, it mostly presents Lennon from his friend's and widow's point of view. So we see a who's who of 60's radicals (who mostly have aged well, looking happy and healthy), from an era often associated with a muddled mix of change for change's sake idealism, anti-authoritarian rebelliousness, righteous pacifism and drug abuse..., mixed with clips of the playful (if also a bit self-indulgent) Lennon/Ono performance art of the time. For perspective there are some sympathetic and wise words from Sen. George McGovern, newsmen Walter Cronkite and Geraldo Rivera and Vietnam War veteran/activist Ron Kovic. There are also a few historic clips of Presidents Johnson and Nixon and Sen. Strom Thurman and J Edgar Hoover and some recent interviews with ex FBI and administration insiders. But they mostly just reinforce how dangerous, deluded and silly the establishment view was as well.The result of all this conflict was that Lennon quickly became a threat (perceived if not actual) to Nixon's reelection, and in the spring of 1972, Lennon and Ono's visa were revoked and they were given 60 days to leave the country. This had the effect of making the pair less radical, more circumspect and realistic (paranoid yet probably rightly concerned for their lives), but they didn't just roll over and give in. In fact after three and a half years they won! And on a sweetly symbolic note, John and Yoko got the news of their victory on Oct 9th, 1975 his 35th birthday and the birthday of their son Sean!John and Yoko are presented idealistically as the perfect artistic/creative/visionary couple. They also are presented as being a bit naive and used/manipulated by the more experienced political radicals of the time. But none of this detracts from the charm of Lennon (and his muse). From the vantage point of today it is easy to dismiss the whole 60's movement as naive and manipulated (and ultimately assimilated and commercialized by mainstream America), but within the confusion was real change and a real struggle of visions (Love vs. Fear, Peace vs. War), that continues to this day...I remember hearing the news of Lennon's assassination one gray winter's day. The college radio station DJ made the announcement and then proceeded to play the second side of Robert Ashley's surrealistic spoken word's ofRobert Ashley: Private Parts (the record)(from The Backyard; ""...Giordano Bruno, I think they burned him, he was too positive; fight fire with fire....""). As I sat alone soothed and transported by Ashley's hypnotic voice, the news gently sunk in and I realized the whole world was grieving.

Don't expect to see a historical recounting of the Beatles' break-up or their fabulous rise in the music industry; these things are only touched on and are not what the film should be about with a title such as this one anyway.Focusing precisely on Lennon's involvement in the ""flower power"" movement during the Vietnam War, the film's nexus is about the perceived threat that John Lennon wielded toward the Nixon Administration and their attempts to remove him from U.S. soil by any means possible.Great additions were made to the documentary with interviews by Walter Cronkite, Gore Vidal, and G. Gordon Liddy (as well as many others) who gave insights into these times-gone-by. Gore Vidal makes a bold statement about how ""Nixon represented death and Lennon represented life"" and so the clash was set from the get-go. Vidal also notes that ""Mr. Bush's administration represents similar notes to Nixon's."" This will most certainly turn-off the conservative right but, again, this film preaches more to the choir than trying to change anyone's mind.Most enjoyable are all of the many archival film pieces that litter the documentary and give the viewer that ""Wow, where did that come from"" feeling. They include private home movie footage of John and Yoko with their child, as well as never before seen shots of the ""peace bed"" they shared immediately after their wedding.Any negatives have to be aimed at the limited information on John's battle with heroin and other drugs during this time. But, again, that's not what this film is about. It's about how the government of the time viewed Lennon as a threat toward its goal of achieving some sort of victory in Vietnam. It's about how the Nixon Administration tried to use its muscle to evict Lennon and Yoko from the U.S. via the Immigration and Naturalization process; an attempt that ultimately failed. These aspects are studied in minute detail and are rightfully given the most film time.",5,Lennon's Message Lives On,1172707200,"03 1, 2007",2007,2280,"['Preaching', 'choir', 'going', 'be', 'common', 'cliche', 'heard', 'excellently', 'done', 'documentary', 'wo', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'how', 'well', 'message', 'how', 'well', 'film', 'put', 'together.THE', 'U.S', 'VS.', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'Beatle', 'legend', 'John', 'Lennon', 'political', 'arena', '60s', '70s', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'historical', 'recounting', 'Beatles', 'break-up', 'fabulous', 'rise', 'music', 'industry', 'things', 'are', 'only', 'touched', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'title', 'such', 'one', 'anyway.Focusing', 'precisely', 'Lennon', 'involvement', 'flower', 'power', 'movement', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'nexus', 'perceived', 'threat', 'John', 'Lennon', 'wielded', 'Nixon', 'Administration', 'attempts', 'remove', 'U.S.', 'soil', 'means', 'possible.Great', 'additions', 'were', 'made', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'G.', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'others', 'who', 'gave', 'insights', 'times-gone-by', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'bold', 'statement', 'how', 'Nixon', 'represented', 'death', 'Lennon', 'represented', 'life', 'so', 'clash', 'was', 'set', 'get-go', 'Vidal', 'also', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'administration', 'similar', 'notes', 'Nixon', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'turn-off', 'conservative', 'right', 'again', 'film', 'more', 'choir', 'trying', 'change', 'anyone', 'mind.Most', 'enjoyable', 'are', 'many', 'archival', 'film', 'pieces', 'litter', 'documentary', 'give', 'viewer', 'Wow', 'where', 'did', 'come', 'feeling', 'include', 'private', 'home', 'movie', 'footage', 'John', 'Yoko', 'child', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'seen', 'shots', 'peace', 'bed', 'shared', 'immediately', 'wedding.Any', 'negatives', 'have', 'be', 'aimed', 'limited', 'information', 'John', 'battle', 'heroin', 'other', 'drugs', 'time', 'again', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'how', 'government', 'time', 'viewed', 'Lennon', 'threat', 'goal', 'achieving', 'sort', 'victory', 'Vietnam', 'how', 'Nixon', 'Administration', 'tried', 'use', 'muscle', 'evict', 'Lennon', 'Yoko', 'U.S.', 'Immigration', 'Naturalization', 'process', 'attempt', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'aspects', 'are', 'studied', 'minute', 'detail', 'are', 'rightfully', 'given', 'most', 'film', 'time']",N/A

Erland,"[3, 4]","The '06 release of the documentary `The U.S. vs. John Lennon' provides a fond look back at the turbulent sixties and the activities of the most notorious Beatle of them all, the late John Lennon. I was a teenager at the time and somewhat of a Beatles fan so I remember most of what's included in this DVD. I will also admit that John was my least favorite of the Fab Four so I didn't approach my viewing of this film as one of the adoring Lennonites, which there are many.Having said that I will also say that overall I appreciated directors David Leaf and John Scheinfeld work on this endeavor. It was well produced, informative and kept me focused from beginning to end. It was an enjoyable overview of a time when the lines between good and evil seemed to be so well defined.There are however some shortcomings. For the most part John is presented as a near faultless, highly evolved individual, almost prophetic and messianic at times. Yes it does include some comments with John detractors such as Gordon Liddy but the clips chosen are tailored to make them appear as mean-spirited individuals out of touch with reality, thus elevating John's iconic status even further.The film is definitely worth a watch, but I don't think John deserves quite the amount of praise and adulation this documentary intends to lavish upon him. Whether you loved John or hated him he definitely left an indelible mark on the Occidental culture that won't soon be forgotten.My rating: 3  Stars, losing a star and a half due to a rather discernable lack of balance in presentation.",3,The Ballad Of John And Yoko Revisited,1173571200,"03 11, 2007",2007,1565,"[""'06"", 'release', 'documentary', 'U.S.', 'vs.', 'John', 'Lennon', 'fond', 'look', 'back', 'turbulent', 'sixties', 'activities', 'most', 'notorious', 'Beatle', 'late', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'teenager', 'time', 'somewhat', 'Beatles', 'fan', 'so', 'remember', 'most', 'what', 'included', 'DVD', 'will', 'also', 'admit', 'John', 'was', 'least', 'favorite', 'Fab', 'Four', 'did', ""n't"", 'approach', 'viewing', 'film', 'one', 'adoring', 'Lennonites', 'are', 'many.Having', 'said', 'will', 'also', 'say', 'overall', 'appreciated', 'directors', 'David', 'Leaf', 'John', 'Scheinfeld', 'work', 'endeavor', 'was', 'well', 'produced', 'informative', 'kept', 'focused', 'beginning', 'end', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'overview', 'time', 'when', 'lines', 'good', 'evil', 'seemed', 'be', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'however', 'shortcomings', 'most', 'part', 'John', 'presented', 'near', 'faultless', 'highly', 'evolved', 'individual', 'almost', 'prophetic', 'messianic', 'times', 'Yes', 'include', 'comments', 'John', 'detractors', 'such', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'clips', 'chosen', 'are', 'tailored', 'make', 'appear', 'mean-spirited', 'individuals', 'touch', 'reality', 'thus', 'elevating', 'John', 'iconic', 'status', 'even', 'further.The', 'film', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'John', 'quite', 'amount', 'praise', 'adulation', 'documentary', 'lavish', 'loved', 'John', 'hated', 'definitely', 'left', 'indelible', 'mark', 'Occidental', 'culture', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'be', 'forgotten.My', 'rating', '3', 'Stars', 'losing', 'star', 'half', 'due', 'rather', 'discernable', 'lack', 'balance', 'presentation']",N/A

For one thing, the film is far better as a narrative about Lennon's involvement in the peace movement than as a narrative about Lennon's battles with the FBI and INS; it is these battles from which the movie draws its title, but only about the last half-hour of the movie is focused on this segment of Lennon's life.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it does make the title more than a bit misleading.  A much better title for the film would have been ""Give Peace A Chance.""I've got one other major complaint, and it may seem like a picky one, but here goes anyways.  Gore Vidal is interviewed several times, and at one point toward the end of the film he's talking about John Lennon, and says, ""He represented life, which is admirable.  And Mr. Nixon -- and Mr. Bush -- represent death.  And that is a bad thing.""  Gosh, you think?  Now, I'm no fan of George W. Bush, either; he's clearly one of the worst things to ever happen to this country, politically speaking.  But what does that have to do with THIS movie?  It's even worse, because Vidal is looking directly at the camera while saying the final line.  This could not possibly have been more phony, more pretentious, more high-minded, or more grating; and just because I happen to agree with the sentiment does not mean that it ought to have been there in the first place.  It shouldn't have.  It's an incredibly false note in an otherwise impeccable production.That aside, though, this is a very good movie.

Either Leaf and Scheinfeld are amazingly crafty or Lionsgate hired some premium Avid Xpress editors, because they managed to make the stills from the 60s and 70s come alive.  They moved you through the photographs by cutting them into pieces and flying the camera between the layers.  Awesome!As for the movie, I felt that it was a bit flat in story and had to be pumped up with the digital imagery, Beatles background story and some needless interviews with peripheral people of the day.  The case against Lennon could be told in a half-hour commentary, but to make it a 99-minute movie they had to add a great deal.

Not in the meaning that I didn't like Beatles music but rather I just never listened to it. I was surrounded so much about TALK about how great they were that aside from the rare snippet, I never really heard much. One of the big figureheads and most likely one of the best songwriters in the group and rock world was John Lennon. But he's probably equally known for his political rallyings and cries for peace and it made him an unlikely threat to America's government.His first big controversy was when he said in an interview that the Beatles were more bigger than Jesus popularity-wise or has Lennon himself put it: ""we mean more to kids than Jesus does"". This gets him in huge hot water with protests and record smashing that we later saw with the whole pope picture/Sinead O' Connor controversy. But it didn't stop there as the more political and socially outspoken he got, the more the government got annoyed. Talk of followers and wiretaps are thrown out and at one point, he was even considered being deported.With Vietnam heavy in people's minds at the time, Lennon befriending outspoken people such as Abbie Hoffmann or urging the release of a man convicted of giving marijuana to an undercover cop seemed like a bit of a bad move. But in a way he knew how to push buttons as efficiently as possible. Who else would think of an idea of staging a bed-in, basically a whole week in bed which would get attention no matter how absurd an idea it is. Plus it helped he had some big protest songs such as Give Peace a Chance and what's most likely piano's answer to a beginner guitarist, that of Imagine. Why he would get such attention is beyond me but it's evidence of how I see America: if the words coming out of your mouth are even slightly left of ""America rules"" than you're in trouble.The film as a whole on the other hand feels almost sluggish. It reminds me of one of those A&E; documentaries I see where it helps to have commercial breaks now and then to break things up. The actual stuff being mentioned is interesting but it's presented in such a way that it seems like one of those educational videos professor's make you watch. Whereas other documentaries work as films as well as what the topic is, this seems like a great topic with a serviceable presentation. It's also got too much of an abrupt ending with of course the murder of Lennon but it comes and then it's like the film just ends without a kind of resolution for it; it almost feels more like a last-minute scene rather than a fully expanded on one.For Beatles fans who have to devour everything, this is of course where to go.

Using footage from interviews, press conferences, concerts, home movies, and news reports combined with interviews with key figures like Noam Chomsky, Angela Davis, G Gordon Liddy, Geraldo Rivera, and Gore Vidal, they put together a well-reasoned assessment of Lennon's activities and the mood of the nation, administration and the world at the time.Lennon traded in his mop-top pop image for a more gritty and important role as a songwriter with a message, and that message was Peace.  As he so simply put it, ""Peace has never been given a chance.""  And the message ""Give Peace a Chance"" resonates so loudly that its simplicity is its power.  He believed in it and he lived it.  With so many people looking up to him, he used his celebrity to speak to this crucial message.The film shows footage from the famous Bed-Ins, where Lennon and Ono stayed in bed in protest.  The biggest criticism anyone can raise to those week-long events is that they are Utopian and what's wrong with that?  What did it hurt to have photos in every major newspaper and on the nightly news showing Lennon and Ono in bed, capturing in every shot a homemade sign with the word Peace prominent.The message of the movie wasn't that Lennon had a squabble with the U.S. Government.  The true message was that the most powerful nation on earth, with the most powerful military in history, is afraid of a simple word.  The message is that Peace can't be given a chance - it must be stopped, it must be crushed, it must be scorned and derided, it must be disempowered, disemboweled, and dismembered.  Peace doesn't have a friendly relationship with profit, so peace must lose.  John Lennon spoke out and used his celebrity to challenge Nixon and for it he was harassed, his privacy was invaded, and his right to live in the U.S. nearly revoked.Sure the movie glossed over his funding of the Black Panthers and didn't spend a lot of time exploring his friendships with other activists, but this was a chronicle, not an expose.It brought forward Lennon's message of peace and made me consider it again.  And it told the story of Lennon's final decade from a new perspective.  It was well-made, and worked on all levels.- CV Rick",5,Give Peace a Chance,1171584000,"02 16, 2007",2007,2551,"['U.S.', 'vs.', 'John', 'Lennon', 'peace', 'activist', 'period', 'pop', 'star', 'life', 'fine', 'chronicle', 'Nixon', 'administration', 'once', 'decided', 'Lennon', 'was', 'threat', 'decided', 'boot', 'country', 'documentary', 'legal', 'struggle', 'as', 'well', 'trying', 'answer', 'question', 'why', 'Lennon', 'was', 'enemy', 'state', 'Using', 'footage', 'interviews', 'press', 'conferences', 'concerts', 'home', 'movies', 'news', 'reports', 'combined', 'interviews', 'key', 'figures', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'Angela', 'Davis', 'G', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'Geraldo', 'Rivera', 'Gore', 'Vidal', 'put', 'together', 'well-reasoned', 'assessment', 'Lennon', 'activities', 'mood', 'nation', 'administration', 'world', 'time.Lennon', 'traded', 'mop-top', 'pop', 'image', 'more', 'gritty', 'important', 'role', 'songwriter', 'message', 'message', 'was', 'Peace', 'so', 'simply', 'put', 'Peace', 'never', 'been', 'given', 'chance', 'message', 'Give', 'Peace', 'Chance', 'resonates', 'so', 'loudly', 'simplicity', 'power', 'believed', 'lived', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'looking', 'up', 'used', 'celebrity', 'speak', 'crucial', 'message.The', 'film', 'shows', 'footage', 'famous', 'Bed-Ins', 'where', 'Lennon', 'Ono', 'stayed', 'bed', 'protest', 'biggest', 'criticism', 'anyone', 'can', 'raise', 'week-long', 'events', 'are', 'Utopian', 'what', 'wrong', 'What', 'did', 'hurt', 'have', 'photos', 'major', 'newspaper', 'nightly', 'news', 'showing', 'Lennon', 'Ono', 'bed', 'capturing', 'shot', 'homemade', 'sign', 'word', 'Peace', 'prominent.The', 'message', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'Lennon', 'had', 'squabble', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'true', 'message', 'was', 'most', 'powerful', 'nation', 'earth', 'most', 'powerful', 'military', 'history', 'afraid', 'simple', 'word', 'message', 'Peace', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'given', 'chance', 'must', 'be', 'stopped', 'must', 'be', 'crushed', 'must', 'be', 'scorned', 'derided', 'must', 'be', 'disempowered', 'disemboweled', 'dismembered', 'Peace', ""n't"", 'have', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'profit', 'so', 'peace', 'must', 'lose', 'John', 'Lennon', 'spoke', 'out', 'used', 'celebrity', 'challenge', 'Nixon', 'was', 'harassed', 'privacy', 'was', 'invaded', 'right', 'live', 'U.S.', 'nearly', 'revoked.Sure', 'movie', 'glossed', 'funding', 'Black', 'Panthers', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'exploring', 'friendships', 'other', 'activists', 'was', 'chronicle', 'not', 'expose.It', 'brought', 'forward', 'Lennon', 'message', 'peace', 'made', 'consider', 'again', 'told', 'story', 'Lennon', 'final', 'decade', 'new', 'perspective', 'was', 'well-made', 'worked', 'levels.-', 'CV', 'Rick']",N/A

Everyone remembers Lennon as a musical genius, but beyond music-making he crafted a savvy and principled political persona that found its reason for being in protesting the Vietnam war (in which two million Vietnamese died). The soundtrack will bring goose bumps to baby boomers, as will the archival footage of the war in Southeast Asia and protests at home, the cast of characters, including Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Angela Davis and Bobbie Seale, and Yoko Ono's retrospective reflections. Only the last third of this documentary deals with the film's title, the five year effort of the Nixon administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport Lennon, along with the harassment and intimidation of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. In the end Lennon won permanent residency after Nixon's landslide victory in 1972. When a reporter asked if he bore any grudges, Lennon replied, ""No, I believe time wounds all heels.""

It works partially as an expose on the history of Mr. Lennon's legal entanglements, but it becomes too much of everyone's commentary on the times and his music. If it's to focus on his legal issues as the title conveys, then let it focus on that.  It does add the gratuitous Beatles video and some pretty rare early '70s concert footage documenting John's anti-war stance and the Attica-era music, but there's already numerous documentaries that this would be better used in.Being done from Yoko's loving perspective is quite evident; I'm a huge Beatles fan and enjoyed Lennon's music, but I also know he had many personal insecurities, often publically rude/violent when drunk, a heavy drug-user, and of course beat his first wife and ignored Julian. Does this have bearing on the subject matter..? Not in relation to the legal issues which persecuted his stay, but it's as much relevant as some of the glossy praise that occasionally smothers what would have otherwise been a facinating look at the US Legal system, and why the White House had him on their 'hit list'.In interviews in the late '70s, Lennon claimed that the only reason he delved into the politics during this era was because he felt guilty about being a rich rockstar. Plus in some Lennon books, it's indicated that he kept all the royalties for these songs.

646579,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B00005JP9L,Deborah Earle,"[1, 2]","Writers/directors David Leaf and John Scheinfeld present us with an engaging documentary about the Nixon Administration's  attempt to deport actor/singer John Lennon in the wake of the former Beatle's anti- war protest.The personal stake I would have on this issue is that my Dad was on the first of two voluntary Air Force tours of duty with the Disaster Preparadeness Unit (the military's answer to the Red Cross) in Vietnam around the time John Lennon and Yoko Ono stepped up public denunciations of the war. Dad hasn't objected to Lennon's stance in retrospect because the 1964 deathbed plea of General Douglas MacArthur (a personal hero of his, and more interestingly since the early '90s, a native of former President Clinton's home state, which has a strong military tradition), made after a lifetime of observations and direct involvement in Asian affairs, was that America stay out of the conflict in Vietnam because Westerners should not fight land wars in Asia, nor should they fight in the jungle, nor should one country fight in another's civil war. All three strategies have proven to be historically disastrous.I feel, however that Leaf and Scheinfeld could have taken this documentary in a different direction, however, placing a bit more emphasis on the early-life issues that were the most likely influence on his later behavior.Americans could give more thought to the fact that 9 times out of 10, when the British in general advise us that certain military strategies are a mistake, chances are it's because they made those mistakes first. They once had history's mightiest Empire because they fought with everyone with whom there could possible be to fight on this planet during the whole millenium of their existance, and consequently should know bad military strategy when they see it, and if America's ""mother country"" was speaking to us, clearly, ""Mother"" was trying to warn us that we were making a mistake.It's no coincidence  that Lennon and many other British Invaders took a strong anti-war stance during the time of U.S troop involvment in Vietnam; the vast majority of them could have been killed in World War II as children and could probably empathize better with the plight of Vietnamese civilians.Lennon was born during the air raid over Liverpool(Read:Industrial town+ Seaport = Inevitable prime target for the Luftwaffe) on October 9, 1940, and like all newborns in hospitals of that area, was whisked to the hospital nursery upon delivery and placed in a basket beneath his bassinet to protect him from potential injury in case the hospital was bombed and the ceiling caved in, and spent  the first 4 1/2 years of his life dodging Luftwaffe bombs. While many of us are old enough  to remember the last day of his life, if we consider the events of the first day of his life, it should explain enough about the anti-war protest he made somewhere in between.Other reviewers mention Lennon's abandonment of his  first wife and son, Julian--a detail excluded from this film. But Lennon, too experienced abandonment by his parents in his early life, and his family's dysfunction may have been another symptom of the war.I couldn't say I agreed 100% with his support of John Sinclair, who was convicted of possession of marijuana in 1969. But the Nixon Administration's ultimately futile attempt to deport Lennon was more out of pettiness than a justifyable attempt to dissuade someone who supported a law-breaker.Yoko Ono, who herself survived air raids over Tokyo as a child, Tariq Ali, Ron Kovacs, Carl Bernstein, Dick Cavett, Angela Davis, Chris Charlesworth, George McGovern, Gore Vidal Noam Chomsky, and Geraldo Rivera are among the  luminaries of the period, interviewed in counterpoint to the archival footage.Viewers are presented with familar footage of the Lennons--their ""bed in"" for peace, John's performance of ""Imagine"", Lennon with son, Sean who turned one the day his father was vindicated in court, and ultimately, we relive those sad days of December, 1980.As I conclude my homage to the World's Most Famous Battle of Britain Baby in time for what would have been his 67th birthday,  I feel sufficiently appreciative of the empathy most reviewers on this site have shown for a man whose life of rebelliousness may have been one long attempt to overcome post traumatic stress disorder, but whose example as a peace activist shook many out of complacency along the way.",4,Behaving Like a

Hartley,"[3, 3]","Back in 1972, the U.S. government handed a certain British &eacute;migr&eacute; a rather abrupt eviction notice, informing him and the missus that they had 60 days to get out of the country or face deportation proceedings.This event would likely have not caused much of a ripple in anyone else's life, had the folks in question not been a married couple known to millions simply as ""John & Yoko"". And so began a highly politicized, four-year legal battle for citizenship, chronicled in the documentary ""The US vs. John Lennon"".You know the back story: After a very public and controversial courtship, John Lennon and Yoko Ono marry in 1969, the Beatles break up, and the couple begin making their own headlines with a series of mildly political ""performance art"" media stunts (starting with the relatively benign ""Bed-In For Peace"") and then move to NYC in the early 70's, where they begin to openly sympathize with the ""radical"" American political groups of the time, much to the chagrin of the Nixon administration. The apparent last straw for Tricky D.& Co. was John and Yoko's 1972 appearance at a charity concert to help cover legal fees for White Panther Party founder John Sinclair, who had been jailed ostensibly on drug charges, but was considered by many at the time to be a political prisoner.Declassified documents now prove that, from day one,there was direct inter-agency manipulation of John and Yoko's deportation proceedings, from the FBI all the way up to the Oval Office, resulting in a nearly four-year long persecution that was probably best described by Lennon himself, who referred to the machinations as ""Kafkaesque"".The film features great archival footage, with recollections from the likes of Bobby Seale, John Sinclair, Geraldo Rivera, Noam Chomsky, Ron Kovic, Paul Krassner, George McGovern, and, er, G. Gordon Liddy (guess whose side he's on). The most insightful comment comes from the ever-glib Gore Vidal, who, when asked what it was about Lennon that made him such a threat to the Nixon cabal, says: ""He (Lennon) represented Life, and was admirable.

Regardless of whether one agrees with him or not, we have to admire his unique ability to communicate with mass audiences, both through his music and through the media.  He could deliver the kind of messages that the government of the time under Richard Nixon singularly failed to do.  Because of this ability, Nixon's government and the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover considered him an ""undesirable alien"" and made strenuous efforts to have him deported.  It is testament to Lennon's conviction that he successfully resisted them.  Using archive footage as well as interviews with those involved, THE US vs. JOHN LENNON offers a convincing defense of individualism, as well as a stinging rebuke to those who would mobilize governmental forces to suppress it.  Produced in 2006, the documentary had a particular resonance at the time of its first release, as the administration under George W. Bush was pursuing an equally unjust war in Iraq.

But that was indeed what John Lennon was, at least in the paranoid minds of the Nixon Administration.  And it is that very thing explored in David Leaf and John Scheinfeld's superlative documentary THE U.S. VS. JOHN LENNON, which details how the ex-Beatle and his wife Yoko Ono had to struggle just to remain in this great nation of ours.Lennon's effect on the world, of course, has been documented ad infinitum in books, magazines, videos, newspapers, and the like.  But the level of paranoia directed against him is really explored in great depth by those who were there, and those who knew him face-to-face.  The film shows us how growing up without a father or, for all intents and purposes, a mother tended to make him question authority to the nth degree; and his first public brush with authority in a big way was when, in 1966, he had to explain what he meant when he had said that the Beatles had become more popular than Jesus Christ (which, when put into context, was more than a little true).  The revolutions and peace demonstrations that occured during the late 1960s and 1970s as a result of the Vietnam War were something that Lennon just couldn't ignore and he waded right into it with all the force of his convictions and, unquestionably, his celebrity.  But at some point, particularly when the 26th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified to give people the right to vote beginning at age eighteen, Lennon was to find himself in the crosshairs of the Nixon cabal.  For several years, the INS tried to kick Lennon and Ono out of America, ostensibly due to Lennon having been busted in London in October 1968 for having one-tenth of an ounce of grass on his person.  The real reason, of course, was his anti-war stance--a fact made blatant here by the appearance of Watergate conspirator Gordon Liddy.  Lennon became every bit as paranoid as the people trying to oust him, perhaps even so far as to believe they were out to kill him.  They weren't able to, of course; but they made life very difficult for Lennon and Ono.Featuring interviews with people like Yoko Ono herself, Carl Bernstein, Ron Kovic, Walter Cronkite, ex-Black Panther Bobby Seale, activist Angela Davis, former South Dakota senator George McGovern, and others, THE U.S. VS. JOHN LENNON is not only about Lennon himself, but the way this country was polarized along ideological and generational lines because of the Vietnam War.  If this film is ideologically slanted towards sympathy for Lennon, as undoubtedly a lot of people with far-right-wing political persuasions would say, then so be it.  Lennon believed in the country that had inspired him to seek the career in music that he had, and the ideals it stood for.  But he did not agree with the powers-that-be of that era, and for that, he was hounded by those powers.  The fact that he and Ono came out victorious in their struggle is a testament to this nation's belief in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.THE U.S. VS. JOHN LENNON makes for a superlative double bill with the Dixie Chicks documentary SHUT UP AND SING in how big-name people can open up the eyes of a nation to injustices committed by their government in their name.  Lennon was that kind of a celebrity, one who cared a great deal about America and the human race, and this film brilliantly celebrates the struggle he endured here.",5,Instant Karma Revisited,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,3592,"['would', ""n't"", 'think', 'simple', 'Brit', 'who', 'was', 'integral', 'part', 'biggest', 'rock', 'band', 'history', 'who', 'promoted', 'peace', 'love', 'understanding', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'threat', 'national', 'security', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'indeed', 'what', 'John', 'Lennon', 'was', 'least', 'paranoid', 'minds', 'Nixon', 'Administration', 'very', 'thing', 'explored', 'David', 'Leaf', 'John', 'Scheinfeld', 'superlative', 'documentary', 'THE', 'U.S', 'VS.', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'details', 'how', 'ex-Beatle', 'wife', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'had', 'struggle', 'just', 'remain', 'great', 'nation', 'ours.Lennon', 'effect', 'world', 'course', 'been', 'documented', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'books', 'magazines', 'videos', 'newspapers', 'like', 'level', 'paranoia', 'directed', 'really', 'explored', 'great', 'depth', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'who', 'knew', 'face-to-face', 'film', 'how', 'growing', 'up', 'father', 'intents', 'purposes', 'mother', 'tended', 'make', 'question', 'authority', 'nth', 'degree', 'first', 'public', 'brush', 'authority', 'big', 'way', 'was', 'when', '1966', 'had', 'explain', 'what', 'meant', 'when', 'had', 'said', 'Beatles', 'had', 'become', 'more', 'popular', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'when', 'put', 'context', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'true', 'revolutions', 'peace', 'demonstrations', 'occured', 'late', '1960s', '1970s', 'result', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'were', 'something', 'Lennon', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'waded', 'right', 'force', 'convictions', 'unquestionably', 'celebrity', 'point', 'particularly', 'when', '26th', 'Amendment', 'Constitution', 'was', 'ratified', 'give', 'people', 'right', 'vote', 'beginning', 'age', 'eighteen', 'Lennon', 'was', 'find', 'crosshairs', 'Nixon', 'cabal', 'several', 'years', 'INS', 'tried', 'kick', 'Lennon', 'Ono', 'America', 'ostensibly', 'due', 'Lennon', 'having', 'been', 'busted', 'London', 'October', '1968', 'having', 'one-tenth', 'ounce', 'grass', 'person', 'real', 'reason', 'course', 'was', 'anti-war', 'stance', 'fact', 'made', 'blatant', 'here', 'appearance', 'Watergate', 'conspirator', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'Lennon', 'became', 'bit', 'as', 'paranoid', 'people', 'trying', 'oust', 'perhaps', 'even', 'so', 'far', 'believe', 'were', 'out', 'kill', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'course', 'made', 'life', 'very', 'difficult', 'Lennon', 'Ono.Featuring', 'interviews', 'people', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'Carl', 'Bernstein', 'Ron', 'Kovic', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'ex-Black', 'Panther', 'Bobby', 'Seale', 'activist', 'Angela', 'Davis', 'former', 'South', 'Dakota', 'senator', 'George', 'McGovern', 'others', 'U.S', 'VS.', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'not', 'only', 'Lennon', 'way', 'country', 'was', 'polarized', 'along', 'ideological', 'generational', 'lines', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'film', 'ideologically', 'slanted', 'towards', 'sympathy', 'Lennon', 'undoubtedly', 'lot', 'people', 'far-right-wing', 'political', 'persuasions', 'would', 'say', 'then', 'so', 'be', 'Lennon', 'believed', 'country', 'had', 'inspired', 'seek', 'career', 'music', 'had', 'ideals', 'stood', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'powers-that-be', 'era', 'was', 'hounded', 'powers', 'fact', 'Ono', 'came', 'out', 'victorious', 'struggle', 'testament', 'nation', 'belief', 'life', 'liberty', 'pursuit', 'happiness.THE', 'U.S', 'VS.', 'JOHN', 'LENNON', 'superlative', 'double', 'bill', 'Dixie', 'Chicks', 'documentary', 'SHUT', 'UP', 'AND', 'SING', 'how', 'big-name', 'people', 'can', 'open', 'up', 'eyes', 'nation', 'injustices', 'committed', 'government', 'name', 'Lennon', 'was', 'kind', 'celebrity', 'one', 'who', 'cared', 'great', 'deal', 'America', 'human', 'race', 'film', 'brilliantly', 'struggle', 'endured', 'here']",N/A

Pouliot,"[0, 0]","This wonderful documentary film used John Lennon's own recorded interviews and his music to tell the story of his life, his political activism and the negative reaction to it from the US government. Many of the original actors -- Noam Chomsky, Walter Cronkite, Mario Cuomo, Angela Davis, John Dean and a still creepy J. Gordon Liddy -- are still around and gave enlightening interviews. The best part of the film were the many, many archival bits of John and Yoko. I had heard about their ""Bed Peace"" spectacle, in which the pair stayed in bed for a week to protest war. But the footage itself as fun, if not a bit bizarre.Lennon was a cultural phenomenon at a time when radicalism was a scary, hairy thing. To see Lennon pal around with Jerry Rubin and Eldridge Cleaver on the very square, very mainstream ""Mike Douglas Show"" was to see the two opposite ends of the America spectrum in almost comic superimposition. For whatever reasons, Lennon used his popularity and notoriety as an ex-Beatle to advance some rather important issues.You might not believe, as this film suggests, that John Lennon was a secular saint due to his public advocacy for peace. You might not even believe that the US government's attempts to deport Lennon were especially evil or even important. You might wonder whether Lennon's positions were sincere or the narcissistic side-effects of a monstrous ego. And you certainly might not (I didn't) buy the implication that John was deliberately silenced when he died in 1980.

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[0, 0]","The 2006 film THE U.S. VERSUS JOHN LENNON concerns events of more than thirty years ago and comes twenty-six years after John Lennon's death.  Yet it seems timely, with the America suffering these dark days of George W. Bush.  Documenting the Nixon administration's harassment of peace activists John Lennon and Yoko Ono, THE U.S. VERSUS JOHN LENNON may make you think of the Bush government's attack on Joe and Valerie Wilson for calling them out on lying about the reason to invade Iraq.The difference between the fates of the Lennons and the Wilsons is the power elite's present day noise machine, which was in its infancy in the early 1970s.  Today billionaire propagandists such as Richard Mellon Scaife and Rupert Murdoch, allied with Bush White House image-makers, mislead the public through corporate media they either own or influence.  In the early 1970s John Lennon and Yoko Ono had to deal with the Nixon organization.  In the 2000s, in addition to dealing with the Bush gang's tactics, Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame suffered corporate media slander.Harassment works, as THE U.S. VERSUS JOHN LENNON shows John Lennon and Yoko Ono stepping down from their activism in 1972, admitting fear for their safety.  Oddly, the film does not disclose the couple's separation the following year.  While I don't know it for a fact, the intimidation of the Nixon apparatus must have contributed to the marital difficulty, although ultimately Lennon and Ono reunited.

He was a fringe character who nobody would miss.  I believe that Nixon ordered his spooks to kill Lennon because Lennon was so anti war and expressed his opinions very openly.The CIA use drugs, hypnotism and actually program these people to kill for them.  Suddenly, another tragedy has struck and there is a pretend manhunt, and the CIA is so professional that they catch their man right away.For those who doubt what the CIA is capable of, please read ""Acid Dreams,"" by Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain.

646597,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005JP9L,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[24, 26]","John Lennon was not the sort of man who could be bullied. He was a man of incredible principle who, once he believed he was right, simply would not budge. This DVD allows us to revisit the years John Lennon transformed himself from being a musician into a type of politician who used both words and music to deliver his message. His wife Yoko and other peace activists including Abbie Hoffman and John Rubin influenced him greatly, too.Lennon was always the rebel; and one DVD narrator comments that in Yoko John found the other half of his voice. John and Yoko both thought outside the box and were not afraid to stand up for their beliefs. This DVD demonstrates that they knew the press would constantly hound them so they used the media very cleverly to transport their political beliefs, especially about the war in Vietnam, to the world. John and Yoko's honeymoon ""bed-in"" in The Amsterdam Hilton is an example of how skillfully they used the media to their advantage. Excellent!Of course this made the Nixon administration very nervous. Nixon believed that Lennon had the power to steal his thunder; and Nixon was at the very least partially right. Nixon campaigned in 1968 for the presidency with the offer of ""a secret plan"" to end hostilities in Vietnam. As we now know, that certainly was not the case; after Nixon took office Vietnam continued and the conflicts worsened. As more and younger voters were influenced by their idol John Lennon's political beliefs, Nixon became increasingly paranoid and eventually stooped lower than any other president has ever done.At the same time, Lennon and Ono had good reason to be nervous themselves; their phones were almost certainly tapped and they were followed by government ""officials"" everywhere they went. The Lennons were perceived as particularly dangerous after they gave money and support to The Black Panthers. That did not sit well with Nixon and FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover who considered them very much a threat to Nixon's re-election efforts and even Nixon's ability to runt he country smoothly on a daily basis.Of course we know the outcome; therefore spoilers are not a concern as this is a retrospective documentary of well publicized events that dominated the news for years. The government attempted countless times to deport John and Yoko on a minor charge of marijuana possession when John was still living in England. I find it sad that the government of the United States of America had nothing better to do than to pick on John and Yoko to the degree that they did. John and Yoko won their fight and Nixon resigned in disgrace. All too soon we lost John Lennon but he lives on through his words and music.The DVD does an excellent job of integrating interviews with Walter Cronkite, Mario Cuomo, G. Gordon Libby, Bobby Seale and others with newsreel footage of John and Yoko at peace rallies and concerts for peace. Yoko adds her own interviews with an off screen narrator to shed further light on the specifics of their personal and political struggles at that time in their lives together.Is this DVD one sided in favor of John and Yoko? Yes, to some degree. However, G. Gordon Libby gets his share of time on camera and there is quite a bit of newsreel footage of Nixon (well, we can't interview Nixon now) and FBI chief Hoover to showcase the opposition's view of John, Yoko and the ""peaceniks.""One reviewer notes that this documentary does not give us a total picture of John Lennon. That's not a problem because, as the reviewer correctly notes, this particular documentary remains quite focused on the issues between John and the American government. We can certainly understand if this movie does not delve into what the other reviewer refers to as the ""warts and all"" edition of John Lennon as a human being.I don't personally approve of every single move John Lennon made. He did cheat on Yoko; but again that is not the focus of this documentary. On the other hand, the Nixon administration flagrantly abused the law and eventually simply broke it according to Lennon's immigration attorney who is interviewed in this documentary. The Nixon administration was truly paranoid to consider John Lennon a true threat to the Nixon presidency; but, then again, Nixon was a paranoid man who approved the Watergate break-in despite the fact that all indications pointed to a landslide victory in November, 1972. In the final analysis, the American government abused The Lennons; and it's great to see them celebrate their victory on this footage.The bonus features round out the documentary very well. There are intelligent discussions of the highly controversial cover art for the ""Two Virgins"" album; ""Imagine;"" Walter Cronkite meeting The Beatles for the very first time and much, much more. Impressive!The cinematography is quite good; after all, much of this footage is professionally shot newsreel footage and the current interviews are tastefully filmed. The color is pretty good, even in most of the older newsreel footage. The quality of the sound is excellent.In sum, this DVD documents very well the evolution of John Lennon from musician to political activist figure. We see that he was inclined to buck authority from his teenage years on after he lost his mother to a British cop driving drunk. After The Beatles broke up and John and Yoko were free, they were able to explore new areas and express themselves both artistically and politically both at the same time with ""bed-ins"" and concerts for peace. In fact, John became so good at molding music with activism that even the government of the world's most powerful nation grew deeply afraid of him. John's struggles were not in vain--he got his messages out consistently to the people who could choose to take him seriously or not as they pleased. He won his fight with immigration as Nixon was just beginning a lifetime of being a disgraced ex-president.I highly recommend this for John Lennon fans; and historians concerned with the history of social activism will find this DVD informative and very engaging. Unfortunately, with war overseas once again in the news, John's message remains pertinent to this day.",5,War Is Over If You Want It--John's message remains pertinent to this day...,1173571200,"03 11,

For baby-boomers, it is history, for senior citizens it's a time period buried between their own youth and the more current passage of time, and for the new generation, it's an eye-opener.A short time ago I played the DVD titled ""The US vs. John Lennon"" for my family.  While I was very young during the 60's and early 70's, this time period comprised my childhood and early adulthood, therefore, it made its impact.  That, plus the minor fact that I liked the Beatles, was why this film was so appealing.My brother, being a little bit older and much brighter during the time period was able to recall all the historical aspects of the film, while my sister-in-law was enthralled, and especially delighted to see Yoko Ono.  It brought a smile, equivalent to the grin of a Cheshire cat to her face.  So when the political and cultural aspects of the film became too serious for her, she was able to turn to Yoko with fondness and humor.Now my father kept making comments about how John Lennon wasn't a citizen (which at the time he wasn't).  He kept making remarks such as:  They could have deported him at any time; He should stick to music and not politics; We could have ended Vietnam in two weeks; Why was he wearing an Army jacket when he wasn't in the war; He (John) could have went back to his own country if he didn't like it here, etc., etc., etc., all throughout the film.  Then when it was over, he kept telling me that that was a good movie.My aunt was equally thrilled because besides Nixon, someone made a crack about Bush, which being a diehard Democrat, she appreciated.  Mom didn't say too much, but at one point she looked at me and simply asked, ""You paid for this?""  But she was laughing, so she had some appreciation for this documentary as well.  Perhaps it reminded her of when the family used to watch TV sitcoms and controversial news clippings together in the 60's.As for the new generation, my niece was not present, as she is an actress working on tunes of her own.  But she would have appreciated it from an artistic viewpoint.  It was her idea to see Lennon on Broadway, and it opened up the doors to a decade of music that she previously labeled as scary.  This would have built upon her interest and broadened her horizons.Now the very little ones would also be impressed to learn about their parents' and/or grandparents' cultural youth.  At least it would give them something to question, laugh at, or think about.  In other words, they should be exposed to this time period as it is history, and as tumultuous as the sixties were, in retrospect they may appear more innocent than our environment today, with the exception of the Vietnam War.Now it's the terrorists, not the rock stars, whom we want out of our country; so I am sure that they would find this movie to be perplexing, but a learning experience nonetheless.  And isn't it time they should be exposed to someone promoting peace, not war.So get the family together, place the popcorn in the microwave, and toss in the DVD today.

So the message of this poor documentary is that `John would have been nothing without Yoko!'Not once is Julian Lennon mentioned in this perversion of History. Julian suffered all his young life with the pain of being ignored and rejected by his own Father. Yet when Yoko's son is born it is reported as if this experience is revelatory and the only one of significance.John and Yoko were having relationship problems before he died. In fact John was sleeping with another Asian girl introduced to him by Yoko. When John started to fall for her, Yoko terminated the relationship.It is a crime that John Lennon's legacy and fortune are in the hands of Yoko Ono who has proved on numerous occasions how morally malleable she is. Julian Lennon on the other hand is forced to go to auctions to bid for articles that once belonged to his dad.

""The U.S. Vs. John Lennon"" is both a portrait of an artist and a work of truth and urgency about asking questions and speaking out. Directors David Leaf & John Scheinfeld brilliantly manage to capture the spirit of John Lennon, his music and message, and also frame the political unrest of a generation. This is a film that celebrates the marriage of music and history, how the music of an era can define and record it. Lennon comes across as a powerful activist who composed urgent songs asking the world to stop and listen, the music is nicely edited here with images of Vietnam and the 60s, showing how art can embody a time and place. Yoko Ono gives priceless commentary on her life with Lennon, their struggles to promote peace and their fights with a media that sometimes just didn't get it. The political situation of the time is brilliantly explored with key figures of the time giving their views and testimonies. There is also a nice balance here of views, both Noam Chomsky and G. Gordon Liddy appear to discuss Vietnam and the impact on society. Liddy recalls lighting his cigar with a peace activist's candle, a chilling reminder of the kind of politics that have lead us to Iraq today.  And that is the film's great achievement, in finding a way through editing and commentary to show us how these stories are not regulated to the past, they are happening again today. War is again a central debate as well as the darker mechanisms of government. Watch Richard Nixon's footage explaining the needs and reasons to stay in Vietnam and they sound frighteningly close to what George Bush says today about Iraq. In an era where music has been regulated to cheap commercialism, when artists are warned that it's best not to make a fuss, ""The U.S. Vs. John Lennon"" is a call to wake up, to participate, to THINK. This is also a film about how dangerous art can be, it's almost darkly comic to hear about the Nixon White House doing all it could to crush Lennon, to try and even deport the man from the United States. The film tells it's story with great skill, creating a breathless pace in the way it assembles and delivers information with great editing, always employing Lennon's music to awesome effect. The music propels the film, framing every moment, helping the viewer better understand the moments and history. Like the best films, it feels too short and never boring. The filmmakers find a perfect balance of material here, never plowing us under, they keep everything clear and even suspenseful. ""The U.S. Vs.

Like Lee Iacocca, I keep asking myself, ""where is the outrage?""John Lennon, whatever his warts, got it right.  Give peace a chance indeed (see the image I have uploaded, it represents the rest of my life's work and illustrates what Lennon was hinting at).I believe the Dick Cheney, Rudy Gulliani, and Larry Silverstein murdered most if not all of the victims of 9/11 in NYC, and that Paul Wolfowitz and Donald Rumsfeld put a missile into the Pentagon and separately orchestrated the murder of those on the airplane that crashed.  I cannot prove it, but I can certainly say with authority that 9/11 has not been properly investigated; that Iraq was done on a web of lies and that Iran has played Cheney like fiddle, using US power and money and lives to get rid of Iran's two arch-enemies, the Talban and Saddam Hussein.We have gone NUTS as country.

646609,A1537KCD6LBWGI,B00005JP9L,steve_manassas,"[1, 9]","Although I've always liked John Lennon's music, I've never really been a fan of many of his political views, which is why I held off purchasing this documentary until now (from an Amazon Merchant).  In my opinion, it is the weakest of the three major Lennon documentaries.  IMAGINE: JOHN LENNON (1988), is the best one, because it showcases John's entire life.  Even the more recent LENNONYC was a better film than this.  I spent most of my time heckling the leftists, Mark Levin style (""Get out of here, you idiot! You're wrecking my country!"")The bottom line is this:  The reason why the U.S. Government tried to deport John Lennon was not because of his music, his fan following, or even his opposition to the Vietnam War.  Lennon was involved with people like Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, who were not your garden-variety peaceniks, but violent anti-American radicals who wanted to overthrow our Republic and replace it with some kind of neo-Communist-socialist-anarchist state.  People forget that we were on the verge of a violent social revolution in the late '60s and early '70s; while the Nixon administration may have been a little paranoid, any administration would have likely done the same thing given the circumstances.  Recall liberal icon Lyndon Johnson's vendetta against Eartha Kitt when she criticized the Vietnam War during a luncheon with Lady Bird.  Imagine if a rock star had gotten involved with al Qaeda operatives today.In later interviews, John expressed his distaste for the violence of the New Left and other groups.  If he had only publicly distanced himself from the Rubin-Hoffman crowd at the time, no one would have even attempted to kick him out, but he did not, and paid the price.  While in the end, I'm glad he won his fight to stay here, he could have handled it in a more low-profile manner, as even his immigration attorney, Leon Wildes, urged him to do.I also found the bonus section on ""Dissent vs. Disloyalty - Then and Now"" rather interesting, in that it shows the hypocrisy of so many on the Left.  Over and over again, one speaker after another rails against the Bush-Cheney Administration and the Patriot Act and its supposed curbs on free expression.  Two questions:  While any law has the potential for abuse, does anyone think that maybe, just maybe the reason that we have had no terrorist attacks on our home soil since 9/11 (although there have been some near misses) is because of that same Patriot Act?  And if the law was so bad, why didn't B. Hussein Obama (with a lopsided Democratic majority in Congress for two years) make any effort to repeal the law - in fact, Obama cheerfully signed a Patriot Act extension, as I recall.  In fact, most of the supposedly ""evil"" Bush policies have been continued by the Obama administration, although I don't hear old George McGovern complaining about that (although in the case of superradicals Noam Chomsky and Angela Davis, I'm not sure if ANY administration would be far left enough for them).As for the lefties' whining about free speech, their concerns don't seem to apply to Sarah Palin, the largely nonviolent Tea Party movement, conservative talk radio (the Left wants to revive the FCC Fairness Doctrine to silence them), or other dissenters on the right (who the Left has been blaming for the recent shootings in Arizona, among other things).  During the Bush years, dissent was patriotic; under Obama, it's racist (or worse).As for John Lennon, I'm sure that if he were alive today, while he might not agree with the goals of the Tea Party movement, I'm sure that he would support their right to protest.Remember, War is over if you WIN it, which the U.S. really hasn't done since 1945.

646612,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JP9L,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[14, 14]","When former Beatle John Lennon changed from ""entertainer"" to political activist, he suddenly found himself under investigation by the United States Government. In a move that evokes the ""Red scare"" of the 50's, the Nixon administration pushed the Department of Immigration and Naturalization to deport Lennon, wiretap his phone lines, be followed by FBI agents and declared an enemy of the United States because of who he chose to associate with and his opposition to the Vietnam War.Lennon relocated to New York and applied for a Green Card hoping to settle in the country that he had grown to love. This documentary presents comments from both sides; we hear from political activists such as Bobby Seale that Lennon knew at the time as well as his political opponents that worked for the Nixon Administration such as G. Gordon Liddy, John Dean and some of the former FBI agents charged with bringing in incriminating evidence to eliminate Lennon as a threat. Filled with footage of Lennon on ""The Mike Douglas Show"" and interviews throughout the 60's and 70's, the film presents a pretty even handed look at what happened to Lennon when he chose to try and help the various political causes he supported.The one area that the film skimps on is the early indication that he wanted to become political active. The film glosses over most of Lennon's life prior to his meeting Yoko. While this is more background, it would give more information and context. Likewise, ignoring Lennon's ""lost weekend"" where he fell into alcohol abuse, saw his marriage to Yoko fall apart. This bit of information shows the personal cost to Lennon for political activism and the green card situation. These moments would have humanized Lennon even more. He didn't stoically face this situation and come through without personal damage--the emotional and personal cost at the time was quite high.That said, ""The U.S. vs. John Lennon"" does prove that the Nixon Administration had an agenda and was behind trying to deport Lennon because of his views. Evidently Lennon frightened the administration less because of his radical views and more because of the audience he had as a former Beatle and spokesperson for his generation. Lennon could often be nave but it was that very naivety that added charm to his political activism. As he himself pointed out his approach was simple--if it seemed like a good idea, just do it.  He did bring a higher profile to the peace movement and radical politics than they might otherwise have had. Truly, that nave aspect of his character was a positive force because he could approach a project without the cynicism that might otherwise prevent from trying out the ideas that he wanted. Ultimately, Lennon was a great communicator and while his ideas weren't always clear, the intent was always heartfelt and sincere.The DVD quality varies a bit depending on the vintage sources used for the film. The new interviews shot on digital video look crisp and sharp which contrasts to the concert footage of Lennon (shot on film in 1972) and even some of the vintage videotape used (again, from roughly the same time frame). Regardless, this is a solid presentation of what was shown in theaters just be aware that not everything can look pristine. The audio spread in the Dolby Digital 5.1 format and 2.0 is active most during the concert footage but dialogue comes across crisp and clear for most of the film.Special Features: Just a comment about Lion's Gate's DVD authoring. It's annoying. You have to watch their logo and can't skip ahead. It may seem trivial but when you are watching a lot of movies and documentaries, 2 or 3 minutes wasted on warnings and opening logos adds up to a lot of time. Lion's Gate-you need to change this.The selection of special features is small but significant for a documentary like this. We get deleted scenes including interview selections (where Walter Cronkite tells the true story of how Ed Sullivan found out about the Beatles; Sullivan had always claimed he saw a huge crowd for the band at the airport in London and was intrigued enough to book them based on this. Cronkite tells a different story. Evidently Sullivan asked Cronkite about the band after the CBS Evening News ran a story on the band in the UK) and a moving sequence where Lennon's widow Yoko Ono reads the letter that she wrote to the Parole Board in regards to Lennon's assassin Mark David Chapman.A fascinating bit of history that illuminates a part of Lennon largely missed in previous documentaries/biographies on the singer/songwriter/political activist, ""The U.S. vs. John Lennon"" is primarily flawed because of a lack of involvement from those people in Lennon's life prior to Yoko Ono. As a result, we don't quite get the well rounded character study that would be essential to understanding his character. Lennon's political activism was a long time coming-he had always been a rebel and had strong political opinions about the world. This documentary provides a flawed missing link to ""The Beatles Anthology"" about Lennon's life after the band. It's still a fascinating glimpse into a time when political dissent could make a difference and the U.S. Government wasn't quite as good at spin doctoring. It presents Nixon as those of us who were around then remember him-a crafty, paranoid politician that tried to circumvent the U.S. Constitution to get at his political enemies, told the public what it wanted to hear and damaged the Presidency of the United States during his two term reign.",3,Good documentary that leaves part of the story untold,1171843200,"02 19, 2007",2007,5521,"['When',

646615,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B00005JP9L,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[4, 4]","The U.S. vs. John Lennon is the kind of documentary that is just plain inspiring to watch. Filled with tons of archival footage of John Lennon and Yoko Ono during their protests for peace, as well as John steadily fighting his deportation charges, the film shows a man fighting a world-wide battle for peace.At the risk of John Lennon being seen as some kind of holy myth of a man, The U.S. vs. John Lennon includes various interviews and clips describing him and his call for peace.I'm no historian, so I can't speak to the validity of the information being shown and whether it misleads the viewer, but what I can say is that this film allows viwers to see the trials that a great man can be put through by a corrupt government that does not want a message of peace to be sent to the masses.If you're interested at all in John Lennon, peaceful protest, the 60s, the 70s, the government, and any other range of topics, this documentary will be interesting to you and you will be glad you watched it.The DVD has tons of extra footage that wasn't used but is interesting to watch.",5,War is Over (if you want it),1177891200,"04 30, 2007",2007,1079,"['U.S.', 'vs.', 'John', 'Lennon', 'kind', 'documentary', 'just', 'plain', 'inspiring', 'watch', 'Filled', 'tons', 'archival', 'footage', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Yoko', 'Ono', 'protests', 'peace', 'as', 'well', 'John', 'steadily', 'fighting', 'deportation', 'charges', 'film', 'man', 'fighting', 'world-wide', 'battle', 'peace.At', 'risk', 'John', 'Lennon', 'being', 'seen', 'kind', 'holy', 'myth', 'man', 'U.S.', 'vs.', 'John', 'Lennon', 'various', 'interviews', 'clips', 'describing', 'call', 'peace.I', ""'m"", 'historian', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'validity', 'information', 'being', 'shown', 'viewer', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'viwers', 'see', 'trials', 'great', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'corrupt', 'government', 'not', 'want', 'message', 'peace', 'be', 'sent', 'masses.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'John', 'Lennon', 'peaceful', 'protest', '60s', '70s', 'government', 'other', 'range', 'topics', 'documentary', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'will', 'be', 'glad', 'watched', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'tons', 'extra', 'footage', 'was', ""n't"", 'used', 'interesting', 'watch']",N/A
