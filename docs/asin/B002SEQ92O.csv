1286630,A2G4Q94HI16FK9,B002SEQ92O,Cart,"[1, 1]","Prima Princessa Presents Swan Lake DVDA few weeks ago, I reviewed the much loved in our house Prima Princessa Presents: The Nutcracker DVD.Well to my surprise (and the thrill of my daughter!), another treasure showed up in my mailbox soon after.Stephanie Troeller, one of the co-creators of Prima Princessa, generously offered me a copy of Prima Princess Presents: Swan Lake!(She has quickly become my daughter's new favorite person.)Yet another charming DVD, it features our favorite fairy friend who narrates and guides the children through the story.  Swan Lake is performed in scenes by the extraordinary Paris Opera Ballet, and their beauty of the dance is just enthralling.  (I so enjoyed watching such grace and talent!)In between clips, your little ballerina is encouraged to put on their tutu and get up and dance.  I love letting my littles watch something that they can actually participate in!Simple ballet moves are taught and demonstrated throughout by the American School of Ballet.  They are easily shown step by step, and soon your own little Prima Princessa will be up and dancing everywhere she goes.This series is so engaging...it was created by two moms who wanted to share their passion of dance with children in a super fun way. The joy of movement is contagious, and that's what they hope to spread with their DVDs.Prima Princessa ballerina cartoon characterI would say they did an amazing job.Looking for the perfect stocking stuffer for your ballerina?Then you must get Prima Princessa Presents: Swan Lake...and let the dancing begin!And in the meantime, I will anxiously await the release of Prima Princessa Presents: Sleeping Beauty",5,Totally Engaging!,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,1660,"['Prima', 'Princessa', 'Presents', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'DVDA', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'much', 'loved', 'house', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'Presents', 'Nutcracker', 'DVD.Well', 'surprise', 'thrill', 'daughter', 'treasure', 'showed', 'up', 'mailbox', 'soon', 'after.Stephanie', 'Troeller', 'one', 'co-creators', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'generously', 'offered', 'copy', 'Prima', 'Princess', 'Presents', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'quickly', 'become', 'daughter', 'new', 'favorite', 'person', 'Yet', 'charming', 'DVD', 'favorite', 'fairy', 'friend', 'who', 'children', 'story', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'performed', 'scenes', 'extraordinary', 'Paris', 'Opera', 'Ballet', 'beauty', 'dance', 'just', 'enthralling', 'so', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'such', 'grace', 'talent', 'clips', 'little', 'ballerina', 'encouraged', 'put', 'tutu', 'get', 'up', 'dance', 'love', 'letting', 'littles', 'watch', 'something', 'can', 'actually', 'participate', 'Simple', 'ballet', 'moves', 'are', 'taught', 'demonstrated', 'American', 'School', 'Ballet', 'are', 'easily', 'shown', 'step', 'step', 'soon', 'own', 'little', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'dancing', 'everywhere', 'goes.This', 'series', 'so', 'engaging', 'was', 'created', 'two', 'moms', 'who', 'wanted', 'share', 'passion', 'dance', 'children', 'super', 'fun', 'way', 'joy', 'movement', 'contagious', 'what', 'hope', 'spread', 'DVDs.Prima', 'Princessa', 'ballerina', 'cartoon', 'characterI', 'would', 'say', 'did', 'amazing', 'job.Looking', 'perfect', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'ballerina', 'Then', 'must', 'get', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'Presents', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'let', 'dancing', 'begin', 'meantime', 'will', 'anxiously', 'await', 'release', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'Presents', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty']",N/A

Now I actually watched it by myself because my boys wanted nothing to do with it, but it is an adorable DVD.  The DVD puts the story of Swan Lake in a way that kids can understand and is told by an animated Prima Princessa as you see parts of the actual ballet going on.  Throughout the DVD there are also scenes of actual little girls dancing around and practicing ballets.  Ballet steps are also displayed for budding little dancers!Overall, I thought Prima Princessa presents Swan Lake is perfect for any little girls.  It  is a great substitute for everyday cartoons and for the low price, you can't go wrong.  I also like that it is 40 minutes long so you really do get a lot out of the DVD.I received this DVD to review, but this post is 100% my opinion.",5,Adorable!,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,848,"['have', 'tutu-wearing', 'little', 'girl', 'house', 'then', 'must', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', 'Now', 'actually', 'watched', 'boys', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'adorable', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'story', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'way', 'kids', 'can', 'understand', 'told', 'animated', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'see', 'parts', 'actual', 'ballet', 'going', 'DVD', 'are', 'also', 'scenes', 'actual', 'little', 'girls', 'dancing', 'around', 'practicing', 'ballets', 'Ballet', 'steps', 'are', 'also', 'displayed', 'budding', 'little', 'dancers', 'Overall', 'thought', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'perfect', 'little', 'girls', 'great', 'substitute', 'everyday', 'cartoons', 'low', 'price', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'also', '40', 'minutes', 'long', 'so', 'really', 'do', 'get', 'lot', 'DVD.I', 'received', 'DVD', 'review', 'post', '100', '%', 'opinion']",N/A

I even was in it one year. I also remember when my Dad took me to a fancy ballet as a Father-Daughter date once and how exciting that was! There's just something about beautiful ballerina's in fancy costumes and tutus that every little girl loves!My little ballerina is no different! Although the Prima Princessa DVDs are recommended for ages 3-6 my 2 year old loved Swan Lake. We put on one of her 3 tutus (lol) and she'd dance along and kept asking for ""More more pallerinas!!!"" It was so adorable :)The DVD is a mix of acts from professional ballet productions and little girls in tutus learning simple steps and dancing around. The whole story is narrated, so even as an adult you get what's going on ;) I actually learned a lot about the story of Swan Lake. I had seen the animated movie that came out when my youngest sister was little years ago, but hadn't realized it was a famous ballet that came long ago.My daughter and I both really enjoy this DVD and it would be perfect for any little ballerina in your life!I did this review for my blog [...]",5,Prima Princessa is great for your little ballerina!,1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,1152,"['whole', 'time', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'looked', 'forward', 'going', 'Nutcracker', 'single', 'year', 'even', 'was', 'one', 'year', 'also', 'remember', 'when', 'Dad', 'took', 'fancy', 'ballet', 'Father-Daughter', 'date', 'once', 'how', 'exciting', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'about', 'beautiful', 'ballerina', 'fancy', 'costumes', 'tutus', 'little', 'girl', 'loves', 'little', 'ballerina', 'different', 'Prima', 'Princessa', 'DVDs', 'are', 'recommended', 'ages', '3-6', '2', 'year', 'old', 'loved', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'put', 'one', '3', 'tutus', 'lol', ""'d"", 'dance', 'along', 'kept', 'asking', 'More', 'more', 'pallerinas', 'was', 'so', 'adorable', 'DVD', 'mix', 'acts', 'professional', 'ballet', 'productions', 'little', 'girls', 'tutus', 'learning', 'simple', 'steps', 'dancing', 'around', 'whole', 'story', 'narrated', 'so', 'even', 'adult', 'get', 'what', 'going', 'actually', 'learned', 'lot', 'story', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'had', 'seen', 'animated', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'when', 'youngest', 'sister', 'was', 'little', 'years', 'ago', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'was', 'famous', 'ballet', 'came', 'long', 'ago.My', 'daughter', 'really', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'little', 'ballerina', 'life', 'did', 'review', 'blog', '[', ']']",N/A
