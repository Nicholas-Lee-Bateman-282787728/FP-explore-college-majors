I was shocked the most at how awful these sisters treat each other.  My daughter started to treat her little sibling ugly as soon as this movie was over.  Kids will imitate what they see and hear.  It really aggravates me.  The sisters in this poor movie are only concerned with themselves.  It all about ME!

1460079,A1FQAQO2VKWRN,B005GJCGIE,Andy,"[8, 9]","As an adult, I've seen a lot of kids movies...that goes with the territory when you are a parent.  Some of them I find I enjoy every bit as much as movies targeted towards grown ups. In fact, I feel that way about some of the older Barbie Movies.  This one, not quite so much.To be fair, my daughter likes it a lot (if she were doing this review she might even give it more stars), and I can see how it would appeal to younger kids, and fact, this movie seems to be really targeted towards a younger age than the last few.  With Santa as an invisible cast member in this flick,  I think that is to be expected. I think there are some nice messages about how spending time with family is important and can be better than anything else in life.  I even think some of the songs are catchy, though definitely there is a strong pop influence.For anybody who wants a plot breakdown, Barbie and her sisters are planning their ""perfect"" Christmas in New York City, where each one will be doing an activity by themselves that they really enjoy.  But nasty snow storms ground their flight and leave them seeking shelter seemingly in the middle of nowhere at the Tannenbaum Inn, where they are welcomed by the every-jolly Christie Clausen and the Elif family.  With a heaping dose of magic from a frequently mentioned, but never shown Santa Claus (Christie's Uncle), the sisters learn for themselves that spending time together is what really makes their Christmas perfect.When seen from the eyes of a child, this is a cute movie...and since it is for the children, their perspective matters in determining if this movie is worth buying.  I don't regret it...I may not watch it when she grows up, but for now it is good for her.",3,"Kids Will Love It, Grown Ups Maybe Not",1320969600,"11 11, 2011",2011,1717,"['adult', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lot', 'kids', 'movies', 'territory', 'when', 'are', 'parent', 'find', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'movies', 'targeted', 'towards', 'grown', 'ups', 'fact', 'feel', 'way', 'older', 'Barbie', 'Movies', 'one', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'much.To', 'be', 'fair', 'daughter', 'lot', 'were', 'doing', 'review', 'might', 'even', 'give', 'more', 'stars', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'appeal', 'younger', 'kids', 'fact', 'movie', 'be', 'really', 'targeted', 'towards', 'younger', 'age', 'last', 'few', 'Santa', 'invisible', 'cast', 'member', 'flick', 'think', 'be', 'expected', 'think', 'are', 'nice', 'messages', 'how', 'spending', 'time', 'family', 'important', 'can', 'be', 'better', 'anything', 'else', 'life', 'even', 'think', 'songs', 'are', 'catchy', 'though', 'definitely', 'strong', 'pop', 'influence.For', 'anybody', 'who', 'plot', 'breakdown', 'Barbie', 'sisters', 'are', 'planning', 'perfect', 'Christmas', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'doing', 'activity', 'really', 'enjoy', 'nasty', 'snow', 'storms', 'ground', 'flight', 'leave', 'seeking', 'shelter', 'seemingly', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Tannenbaum', 'Inn', 'where', 'are', 'welcomed', 'every-jolly', 'Christie', 'Clausen', 'Elif', 'family', 'heaping', 'dose', 'magic', 'frequently', 'mentioned', 'never', 'shown', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'Christie', 'Uncle', 'sisters', 'learn', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'what', 'really', 'Christmas', 'perfect.When', 'seen', 'eyes', 'child', 'cute', 'movie', 'children', 'perspective', 'matters', 'determining', 'movie', 'worth', 'buying', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'may', 'not', 'watch', 'when', 'up', 'now', 'good']",Barbie: A Perfect Christmas

Obviously the ""uncle"" was Santa, but still left it up to you to decide if it was really him or not.A couple of good songs - Give it Away was very catchy.  Others not so much.This really is a Skipper movie, but it was a good story about her personal growth.Cons:  This is supposed to be a musical, so the oddness of the first song before they left the house made sense, sort of.  But if this is supposed to be Barbie's real life (family trip with her sisters), not some movie she is doing, why would it be a musical?  I don't make my daily life a musical.  After Barbie sings her ""wish"" song, the whole musical concept falls apart anyway and it just becomes a regular Barbie movie.I thought replacing Kelly Sheridan was to take Barbie in a younger direction.  However, since there are no parents to be found, Barbie becomes the default Mom, thereby making her seem older.I think the animation on Princess Charm School was better, especially since they got rid of the freaky facial shading that has, unfortunately returned in this movie.Most of the songs were not as memorable as previous movies.Personally I can't tell that much difference between Kelly Sheridan and her replacement, so I'm not on any side of this bandwagon.All-in-all, a decent, watchable, family Christmas movie.

There are two very good lessons for children: the first lesson is that it's okay to ask others to help when you need it, and the second lesson is that what really makes Christmas perfect is the time spent with family.  Very sweet addition to your Barbie Movie Collection.  The movie has a very simple and uplifting message. The only thing that my kids didn't like was that they changed the youngest sister's name from Kelly to Chelsie (not sure if I spelled that correctly, but you get the idea).  Bottom line: the kids really enjoyed this movie and suprisingly so did I.",5,Cute Movie!

My girls, 6 & 3, were very excited they finally included Barbie's 3 little sisters in this movie (why do they never tell us where the parents went???).  Overall an enjoyable movie. Singing was not fabulous, but you get used to it. If all Barbie movies could be musicals, my girls would be happy campers. Throw a song and dance number in the middle of any ol movie and they love it I think.  Liked that there was no love interest, no boys, no ""bad guy"", just Barbie, her sisters, and some obstacles. Cute movie with a couple of catchy songs we couldn't get out of our heads. My parents gave this to my girls on Thanksgiving and we all sat down as a family and watched it. While I'm sure my husband and father didn't love it, I swear to you, they sat here and watched it. They could have easily left the room and watched something upstairs (but thats a secret ;)",4,Pleasantly Surprised,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,968,"['new', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'lately', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'let', 'down', 'girls', 'one', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'My', 'girls', '6', '3', 'were', 'very', 'excited', 'finally', 'included', 'Barbie', '3', 'little', 'sisters', 'movie', 'why', 'do', 'never', 'tell', 'where', 'parents', 'went', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Singing', 'was', 'not', 'fabulous', 'get', 'used', 'Barbie', 'movies', 'could', 'be', 'musicals', 'girls', 'would', 'be', 'happy', 'campers', 'Throw', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'middle', 'ol', 'movie', 'love', 'think', 'Liked', 'was', 'love', 'interest', 'boys', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'Barbie', 'sisters', 'obstacles', 'Cute', 'movie', 'couple', 'catchy', 'songs', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'heads', 'parents', 'gave', 'girls', 'Thanksgiving', 'sat', 'down', 'family', 'watched', ""'m"", 'sure', 'husband', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'swear', 'sat', 'here', 'watched', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'left', 'room', 'watched', 'something', 'upstairs', 'secret']",Barbie: A Perfect Christmas
