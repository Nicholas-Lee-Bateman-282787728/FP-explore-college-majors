He seems to be doing some kind of SNL caricature of his own acting style for CSI: Miami a la Alec Baldwin in The Departed. David Caruso is constantly posing at a 3/4 pivot while uttering the most inane dialogue.  He's just the figurehead to take up some portion of the show so that it's not obvious that we are watching a show basically with some brand new actors.  Basically, the show is beautifully shot and often looks ritzy whereas the orignal CSI is often desert-y.  The show doesn't make any sense except that Miami is like early New York moved closer to the equator.  I really can't say that this is a good show.  It's kind of creepy and I'm not crazy about the cast.  It's a distant and bizarre second to the original CSI but at least there isn't a regular cast member using a wannabe New Yawker accent like CSI:NY.

819988,A4FRRGOBVJ8A5,B00020H9NO,David S. Graham,"[1, 4]","OK, as a big fan of CSI Las Vegas I was disappointed with CSI Miami.  It wasn't just the quirky plots (later seen in CSI NY) that I liked in CSI LV but also the character interactions. First of all, some science folks.1.  When you get a digital image, each pixel is encoded as just that, one pixel.  No matter how much you ""zoom"" you will not get any more detail from that pixel, let alone the image of a murderer from the one pixel like when they zoom in to the cornea of a person from crappy CCTV footage.2.  Oxidation of phenolphthalin to phenolphthalein as a presumptive blood test is a two step process.  First you add phenolphthalin and wait for any colour change (false positive) then you add hydrogen peroxide.  None of this one drop and whoa, it's pink, we have blood.3.  Infra-red camera's cannot see through a wall let alone a boat.  Think about it.  If infra-red rays could travel through walls then why bother insulating house walls?Well, I could go on and on but I wont.  OK, I know all the CSI's use similarly bad science but it just stood out more in Miami.I enjoyed the scenery in Miami but the music intervals were way too loud.  Time and time again I found myself having to turn the volume down for the music and turn it back up for the dialogue.  Bad editing there.Too many non-continuities.  Take for example Marisol.  Eric says to Horatio how he's been paying her rent and expenses because she's sick and on chemo and couldn't work.  Only one or two episodes later Marisol says to Horatio that she has to get back to work.  Then later she's pampering herself at a women only retreat.  Was it at Eric's or Horatio's expense?Oh, and why is it that the CSI guys always get to an emergency before the cops (leaving them to enter the premises toting their guns).  Are there no police cars on random patrol in Miami?  And when the swat team enters a building, why are our CSI chums right behind (or next to them) without proper bullet proof clothing and equipment?I guess the quirkiness of CSI LV and NY meant that you didn't take it too seriously and thus overlooked the flaws while enjoying it.  CSI Miami tries to be serious with flawed science, re-worked themes, poor continuity and over-stylised characters.  Shame, it coulda been a contender.",2,Science stretched too far and bad direction.,1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,2264,"['OK', 'big', 'fan', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'disappointed', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'quirky', 'plots', 'later', 'seen', 'CSI', 'NY', 'liked', 'CSI', 'LV', 'also', 'character', 'interactions', 'First', 'science', 'folks.1', 'When', 'get', 'digital', 'image', 'pixel', 'encoded', 'just', 'one', 'pixel', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'zoom', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'more', 'detail', 'pixel', 'let', 'alone', 'image', 'murderer', 'one', 'pixel', 'when', 'zoom', 'cornea', 'person', 'crappy', 'CCTV', 'footage.2', 'Oxidation', 'phenolphthalin', 'phenolphthalein', 'presumptive', 'blood', 'test', 'two', 'step', 'process', 'First', 'add', 'phenolphthalin', 'wait', 'colour', 'change', 'false', 'positive', 'then', 'add', 'hydrogen', 'peroxide', 'None', 'one', 'drop', 'whoa', 'pink', 'have', 'blood.3', 'Infra-red', 'camera', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'wall', 'let', 'alone', 'boat', 'Think', 'infra-red', 'rays', 'could', 'travel', 'walls', 'then', 'why', 'bother', 'insulating', 'house', 'walls', 'Well', 'could', 'go', 'wont', 'OK', 'know', 'CSI', 'use', 'similarly', 'bad', 'science', 'just', 'stood', 'out', 'more', 'Miami.I', 'enjoyed', 'scenery', 'Miami', 'music', 'intervals', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'loud', 'Time', 'time', 'again', 'found', 'having', 'turn', 'volume', 'down', 'music', 'turn', 'back', 'up', 'dialogue', 'Bad', 'editing', 'there.Too', 'many', 'non-continuities', 'Take', 'example', 'Marisol', 'Eric', 'Horatio', 'how', 'been', 'paying', 'rent', 'expenses', 'sick', 'chemo', 'could', ""n't"", 'work', 'Only', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'later', 'Marisol', 'Horatio', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'Then', 'later', 'pampering', 'women', 'only', 'retreat', 'Was', 'Eric', 'Horatio', 'expense', 'Oh', 'why', 'CSI', 'guys', 'always', 'get', 'emergency', 'cops', 'leaving', 'enter', 'premises', 'toting', 'guns', 'Are', 'there', 'police', 'cars', 'random', 'patrol', 'Miami', 'when', 'swat', 'team', 'building', 'why', 'are', 'CSI', 'chums', 'right', 'next', 'proper', 'bullet', 'proof', 'clothing', 'equipment', 'guess', 'quirkiness', 'CSI', 'LV', 'NY', 'meant', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'thus', 'overlooked', 'flaws', 'enjoying', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'be', 'serious', 'flawed', 'science', 're-worked', 'themes', 'poor', 'continuity', 'over-stylised', 'characters', 'Shame', 'coulda', 'been', 'contender']",CSI: Miami: Season 1
819989,A6P73HMHDW5W3,B00020H9NO,David Solomon,"[16, 43]","""CSI: Miami"" is a good show with a lot of problems that could and should be easily solved.First of all, the characters are never really as defined as the ones on ""CSI.""Secondly, the show occasionally veers away from the mystery/whodunnit format of ""CSI"" and becomes a cop show with a dab of science thrown in.Another standard, un-CSI-like plot line has Horatio Caine disliking a suspect and spending the rest of the show finding evidence to convict him/her. When there's a twist and a 2nd suspect emerges that Caine doesn't like, I find myself not liking Caine.A third problem is David Caruso and his character. Horatio Caine is someone trying to be cool but isn't. His brooding is excessive, and his constant staring off into space is predictable.Then there's David Caruso's inability to find a place for his hands. He's constantly putting them on his hips or putting on/taking off his sunglasses. After about 5 episodes, this gets alternately annoying and hilarious.Another aspect of Horatio Caine is his repetitious dialogue. There are shows where his lines are exactly the same as in last week's show. For example, he's constantly saying, ""OK, this is what we're going to do.""As for the episodes on these disks, there are additional problems.Beautiful Emily Procter is a little too made up.The shows on these disks include the episodes with Kim Delaney, who didn't fit in and was totally unconvincing as a crime scene investigator. The show improved immensely when she left.I don't mind these problems when ""CSI: Miami"" can present you with a good plot twist, poignant story, or last-minute piece of esoteric evidence. But when it fails to deliver, which, during the 1st season, was about every 3rd or 4th episode, the problems become obvious, and the show becomes campy.",3,Not Like the Original,1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,1775,"['CSI', 'Miami', 'good', 'show', 'lot', 'problems', 'could', 'should', 'be', 'easily', 'solved.First', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'as', 'defined', 'ones', 'CSI', 'Secondly', 'show', 'occasionally', 'away', 'mystery/whodunnit', 'format', 'CSI', 'cop', 'show', 'dab', 'science', 'thrown', 'in.Another', 'standard', 'un-CSI-like', 'plot', 'line', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'disliking', 'suspect', 'spending', 'rest', 'show', 'finding', 'evidence', 'convict', 'him/her', 'When', 'twist', '2nd', 'suspect', 'Caine', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', 'not', 'liking', 'Caine.A', 'third', 'problem', 'David', 'Caruso', 'character', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'someone', 'trying', 'be', 'cool', ""n't"", 'brooding', 'excessive', 'constant', 'staring', 'off', 'space', 'David', 'Caruso', 'inability', 'find', 'place', 'hands', 'constantly', 'putting', 'hips', 'putting', 'on/taking', 'off', 'sunglasses', '5', 'episodes', 'alternately', 'annoying', 'aspect', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'repetitious', 'dialogue', 'are', 'shows', 'where', 'lines', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'last', 'week', 'show', 'example', 'constantly', 'saying', 'OK', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'episodes', 'disks', 'are', 'additional', 'problems.Beautiful', 'Emily', 'Procter', 'little', 'too', 'made', 'up.The', 'shows', 'disks', 'include', 'episodes', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'was', 'totally', 'unconvincing', 'crime', 'scene', 'investigator', 'show', 'improved', 'immensely', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'problems', 'when', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'can', 'present', 'good', 'plot', 'twist', 'poignant', 'story', 'last-minute', 'piece', 'esoteric', 'evidence', 'when', 'deliver', '1st', 'season', 'was', '3rd', '4th', 'episode', 'problems', 'become', 'obvious', 'show', 'campy']",CSI: Miami: Season 1

820005,AYQ5QOEUN2I3L,B00020H9NO,Marie Edwards,"[7, 7]","Living in Las Vegas, the last thing I wanted to see was a show about this city on television. Having lived here most of my life, I didn't see anything interesting about it.So, when CSI: Crime Scene Investigation came along, I decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Maybe it would be interesting, after all I enjoyed Profiler until it was cancelled; and this was similiar, yet only to a point.30 minutes into CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, I fell asleep. And, each time I would watch the episodes, I'd nod off. After a few times, I gave it up. (Nothing personal to the cast, but they were not that interesting).But to each their own. If one likes it and another doesn't; it doesn't make it a wrong choice, just personal choices and certainly you shouldn't be comparing the way something is done in one city to what is done in another. We are all looking for something different when we watch TV, and that fuels the choices we make.In 2002, another CSI was coming out, this time with David Caruso as the lead actor and set in Miami. I was thinking Miami Vice with David Caruso; not a pretty sight, but worth a try.Tried it I did, and got hooked (so hooked I own season 1-4 on DVD) and watch it whenever time permits.Here I am, now 5 years later, looking forward to getting season 5 on DVD (I have to wait until Christmas cause someone in my family decided it'd be funny to give it to me as a gift).I find the characters compelling and more approachable, the kind of people you'd call for help.Yes (biting my own tongue), that even includes Caruso's ""Horatio Caine""; one of the best characters on the series. Tough when he has to be, compassionate where it warrants, never once forgetting about the families that are left behind. That to me is his only concern, and that is where it should be. It's that commitment I am attracted to.Yes, he threatens dirtbags (oh my favorite parts of the episodes), but think about this, you would want Caine on your side to find your loved one's killer and would want him to do everything he could to ensure justice was done. No, you wouldn't like it if you were guilty of a crime, who would?He's good with women and children, having perhaps too much of a protective instinct, which is lacking in today's society. Maybe that's why some people dislike his character. (Note: Caine's father killed his mother when he was younger, so there might be a reason for his attitude).His tricks or nuances are his way of letting those around him know that he is always thinking, thinking about ways to get one step ahead of the killer and bring him/her to justice. Not to mention those little ""nuances"" make the suspect nervous, if you're guilty he will make you squirm.The science is at times gruesome, then again, murder isn't pretty. We seem to forget that.Alexx talking to the victims reminds us that these were once people too, that they had families, they were not just something that was discarded as trash.We forget too often after people are dead that they were here and touched someone's life. We forget that they were someone's mother, father, daughter, son, brother, sister. They started out their day planning in some cases to come home to all of us, but fate intervened.Alexx reminds us of this, and I personally like it. We need to be reminded of the consequences of greed, corruption and personal desires.As far as Calleigh, Eric, Speed (who I miss in the series) and the rest of the CSI: Miami team, they are a diverse group that reminds us how workplace politics play a crucial role in how outcomes are determined; they have dedicated their lives to putting criminals behind bars and finding closure for the families.Some of the stories are interesting, some make you think, and others are about par for the course when it comes to reality.If you like it, you like it, there is no explaining it; you either have it on DVD or are planning to get it.If you don't like it, no one is making you watch it or buy it, so leave it alone (clothing is clothing, I can dress like a model by buying certain clothes at Walmart). Don't waste your money, you're better off getting something you do like.If you don't like the acting, don't watch it. This is after all--FICTION. The telling of a story that's purpose is to entertain.And, I plan to keep watching as long as it's on.",5,"Quit Picking At It, Like It or Leave It",1197504000,"12 13, 2007",2007,4319,"['Living', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'last', 'thing', 'wanted', 'see', 'was', 'show', 'city', 'television', 'Having', 'lived', 'here', 'most', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'interesting', 'it.So', 'when', 'CSI', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Investigation', 'came', 'along', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'see', 'what', 'had', 'offer', 'Maybe', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'Profiler', 'was', 'cancelled', 'was', 'similiar', 'yet', 'only', 'point.30', 'minutes', 'CSI', 'Crime', 'Scene', 'Investigation', 'fell', 'asleep', 'time', 'would', 'watch', 'episodes', ""'d"", 'nod', 'off', 'few', 'times', 'gave', 'up', 'Nothing', 'personal', 'cast', 'were', 'not', 'interesting', '.But', 'own', 'one', ""n't"", ""n't"", 'make', 'wrong', 'choice', 'just', 'personal', 'choices', 'certainly', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'comparing', 'way', 'something', 'done', 'one', 'city', 'what', 'done', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'when', 'watch', 'TV', 'choices', 'make.In', '2002', 'CSI', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'time', 'David', 'Caruso', 'lead', 'actor', 'set', 'Miami', 'was', 'thinking', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'David', 'Caruso', 'not', 'pretty', 'sight', 'try.Tried', 'did', 'got', 'hooked', 'hooked', 'own', 'season', '1-4', 'DVD', 'watch', 'time', 'permits.Here', 'am', 'now', '5', 'years', 'later', 'looking', 'forward', 'getting', 'season', '5', 'DVD', 'have', 'wait', 'Christmas', 'cause', 'someone', 'family', 'decided', ""'d"", 'be', 'funny', 'give', 'gift', 'find', 'characters', 'compelling', 'more', 'approachable', 'kind', 'people', ""'d"", 'call', 'help.Yes', 'biting', 'own', 'tongue', 'even', 'Caruso', 'Horatio', 'Caine', 'one', 'best', 'characters', 'series', 'when', 'be', 'compassionate', 'where', 'warrants', 'never', 'once', 'forgetting', 'families', 'are', 'left', 'only', 'concern', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'commitment', 'am', 'attracted', 'to.Yes', 'dirtbags', 'oh', 'favorite', 'parts', 'episodes', 'think', 'would', 'want', 'Caine', 'side', 'find', 'loved', 'one', 'killer', 'would', 'want', 'do', 'everything', 'could', 'ensure', 'justice', 'was', 'done', 'No', 'would', ""n't"", 'like', 'were', 'guilty', 'crime', 'who', 'would', 'good', 'women', 'children', 'having', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'protective', 'instinct', 'lacking', 'today', 'society', 'why', 'people', 'character', 'Note', 'Caine', 'father', 'killed', 'mother', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'might', 'be', 'reason', 'attitude', '.His', 'tricks', 'nuances', 'are', 'way', 'letting', 'know', 'always', 'thinking', 'thinking', 'about', 'ways', 'get', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'killer', 'bring', 'him/her', 'justice', 'Not', 'mention', 'little', 'nuances', 'make', 'suspect', 'nervous', ""'re"", 'guilty', 'will', 'make', 'squirm.The', 'science', 'times', 'gruesome', 'then', 'again', 'murder', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'seem', 'forget', 'that.Alexx', 'talking', 'victims', 'were', 'once', 'people', 'too', 'had', 'families', 'were', 'not', 'just', 'something', 'was', 'discarded', 'trash.We', 'forget', 'too', 'often', 'people', 'are', 'dead', 'were', 'here', 'touched', 'someone', 'life', 'forget', 'were', 'someone', 'mother', 'father', 'daughter', 'son', 'brother', 'sister', 'started', 'out', 'day', 'planning', 'cases', 'come', 'home', 'fate', 'intervened.Alexx', 'personally', 'need', 'be', 'reminded', 'consequences', 'greed', 'corruption', 'personal', 'desires.As', 'far', 'as', 'Calleigh', 'Eric', 'Speed', 'who', 'miss', 'series', 'rest', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'team', 'are', 'diverse', 'group', 'how', 'workplace', 'politics', 'play', 'crucial', 'role', 'how', 'outcomes', 'are', 'determined', 'have', 'dedicated', 'lives', 'putting', 'criminals', 'bars', 'finding', 'closure', 'families.Some', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'make', 'think', 'others', 'are', 'par', 'course', 'when', 'reality.If', 'explaining', 'have', 'DVD', 'are', 'planning', 'get', 'it.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'one', 'making', 'watch', 'buy', 'so', 'leave', 'alone', 'clothing', 'clothing', 'can', 'dress', 'model', 'buying', 'certain', 'clothes', 'Walmart', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'money', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'getting', 'something', 'do', 'like.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'acting', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'FICTION', 'telling', 'story', 'purpose', 'entertain.And', 'plan', 'keep', 'watching', 'as', 'long']",CSI: Miami: Season 1

I picked this up due to the summer break of CSI, I needed something.. and this was my choice! I can honestly say that it was a worthwhile purchase after having watched all of the episodes. True David Caruso is no Gil Grissom, but would you want him to be? The feel of the series is very different with the set being in Miami. The cast is on par with the Las vegas cast. Las Vegas has a more personal feel to it, as many times the originals bring their personal lives into the story (i.e. Catherine being a stripper, Warrick being a Gambler), and you don't find that as much in Miami. The focus seems to stay more to the storyline.Kim Delaney was a welcome cast-off in my opinion. She dragged the series down with her poor attitude, and had no chemistry with David Caruso. She came across as an uptight investigator who had no interest in getting along with her fellow CSIs, or have any passion in getting the truth. I was very glad when she finally left.Another difference between Las Vegas and Miami that is striking is how each CSI is an expert in their certain field. Callegh is the &quot;Bullet Girl&quot;, Speedle is the AV expert, Delco is the Diving tech who speaks russian, and spanish, acts as the go between the Cuban community and the MDPD. Alexx talks to her patients as they were still alive, and in general is friendlier then Al Robbins of Las Vegas.In conclusion, try it, the two CSIs are comparable, like the many Law and Order spinoffs, you can choose your favorite, but in my opinion each one is strong, and holds its own.

For example, Miami felt different than Vegas (even though the pilot episode was actually on CSI: Las Vegas) The Miami setting allowed the series to pursue some unique storylines such as immigration from Cuba and drug smuggling as in Wet Foot, Dry Foot that wouldn't have had the same punch in other locales. I remember when the show premiered, it was at the height of the CSI craze when there was a very real fear that we were going to end up with CSI: Juno Alaska.The characters appear drawn to fit the setting rather than using tired cardboard cutouts like tough talking cop though David Caruso's Horatio Cain fit's the bill. Moving to the actual DVD's...there are seven discs in some very involved packaging fashioned to look like an case file, which I think is a fitting touch given the content of the series. Of course packaging costs and DVD extras probably drive the price of the DVD'S, but the extras really make the audience feel like there a deeper part of the show instead of just plopping a bunch of episodes on discs.",5,CSI: The Miami Chapter,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,1184,"['One', 'thing', 'felt', 'CSI', 'franchise', 'succeeded', 'doing', 'least', 'early', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'being', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'other', 'incarnations', 'CSI', 'example', 'Miami', 'felt', 'different', 'Vegas', 'even', 'pilot', 'episode', 'was', 'actually', 'CSI', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Miami', 'setting', 'allowed', 'series', 'pursue', 'unique', 'storylines', 'such', 'immigration', 'Cuba', 'drug', 'smuggling', 'Wet', 'Foot', 'Dry', 'Foot', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'same', 'punch', 'other', 'locales', 'remember', 'when', 'show', 'premiered', 'was', 'height', 'CSI', 'craze', 'when', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'fear', 'were', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'CSI', 'Juno', 'Alaska.The', 'characters', 'appear', 'drawn', 'fit', 'setting', 'rather', 'using', 'tired', 'cardboard', 'cutouts', 'tough', 'talking', 'cop', 'David', 'Caruso', 'Horatio', 'Cain', 'fit', 'bill', 'Moving', 'actual', 'DVD', 'are', 'seven', 'discs', 'very', 'involved', 'packaging', 'fashioned', 'look', 'case', 'file', 'think', 'fitting', 'touch', 'given', 'content', 'series', 'course', 'packaging', 'costs', 'DVD', 'probably', 'drive', 'price', 'DVD', 'extras', 'really', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'deeper', 'part', 'show', 'instead', 'just', 'plopping', 'bunch', 'episodes', 'discs']",CSI: Miami: Season 1

820019,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,B00020H9NO,"R. Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 5]","I have now watched the original CSI all the way up to the completion of season 8 where they basically killed the show by killing off two main characters. In season nine I know they kill off the the Grissom character, so that is the exodus of three main actors of the CSI series. I'm sure there will still be some appeal of the continuation of the series but I have not as of yet viewed any of the new CSI lineup.So, that being said I picked up a copy of Season 1 of CSI Miami. Now I live in North Florida.  Florida has been my home for all of my life. I would love to love this show, but I don't. It's certainly not awful, but it is also not that great. I think three stars is rather generous all things considered. The biggest problem with this show is probably the David Caruso character of Horatio. Horatio is just too damned cool. He never misspeaks. He is always right. He is extremely intelligent and extremely confident. In fact, the Horatio character must be the James Bond of all of the CSI characters. It's actually just ridiculous. Nobody would act like this guy in real life. Nobody is quite like Horatio in real life. In real life people misspeak, they make mistakes, they make fale hypothesis's. And then their is Horatio and his damned sunglasses. He is forever putting them on and taking them off. He's like the hammer of God or something. In fact, David Caruso's character if very smug. I'm not impressed at all with Caruso or the character of Horatio. Then there is Emiuly Proctor. I must say they fix her up to be great eye candy, even if she isn't overly hot. They slip her into those tight white pants and I must say I am perpetually gawking at her ass, which is accentuated by my widescreen television. As for her character, I like her voice. She is quite smart and professional. What is silly though is how the show tries to show her as perhaps being held back by her looks. She's just too damned hot to be taken seriously, or that is what the show has tried to explain. Her dad just thinks of her as his beautiful daughter overlooking her professional female status as a CSI gal. And then there is 53 year old Khandi Alexander. She's another piece of eye candy, and even at 53. Again, she is slipped into tight pants, tight shirts, bosom hugging blouses, etc. The producers are certainly turning us guys on. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But I can tell you that I am drooling over these two women. There was also the gal that didn't get the promotion because she had to take some time off when her husband died. Again, they pack all this gal has into very tight clothes showing us guys some nice T and A. And this one CSI gal isn't even that hot, but oh yeah, how tight the clothes are. Those tight clothes are nice for showing off the body but they are also distracting from whatever sort of plot the show might have. Then there is Horatio's ex sister in law. Horatio's police brother was killed. She too is made into a hottie, when she is really not so super hot. And on this show we have the ""token"" Cuban character. He's ok, but his addition was just so stereotypical to this show's cast. We have women, blacks, a Cuban American. Did I fail to mention this is South Florida? Ok, and all of these people are fairly pretty or handsome. Anyway, David Caruso's character is ridiculous. The guy is just never wrong and he is just too super cool. The show would be better if the sexiness was toned down. Oh dare I say that when I love to watch the T and A. The reduction of some of the eye candy would make the show seem a little less like Bay Watch, and Caruso wouldn't seem as much like David Hasselhoff.This show needs to pay more attention to real human behavior than to hot looking actors who are too cool for the show's believeability.",3,David Caruso is ridiculously too COOL.,1312070400,"07 31, 2011",2011,3786,"['have', 'now', 'watched', 'original', 'CSI', 'way', 'completion', 'season', '8', 'where', 'basically', 'killed', 'show', 'killing', 'off', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'season', 'nine', 'know', 'kill', 'off', 'Grissom', 'character', 'exodus', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'CSI', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'appeal', 'continuation', 'series', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'viewed', 'new', 'CSI', 'lineup.So', 'being', 'said', 'picked', 'up', 'copy', 'Season', '1', 'CSI', 'Miami', 'Now', 'live', 'North', 'Florida', 'Florida', 'been', 'home', 'life', 'would', 'love', 'love', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'certainly', 'not', 'awful', 'also', 'not', 'great', 'think', 'three', 'stars', 'rather', 'generous', 'things', 'considered', 'biggest', 'problem', 'show', 'probably', 'David', 'Caruso', 'character', 'Horatio', 'Horatio', 'just', 'too', 'damned', 'cool', 'never', 'always', 'right', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'extremely', 'confident', 'fact', 'Horatio', 'character', 'must', 'be', 'James', 'Bond', 'CSI', 'characters', 'actually', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'Nobody', 'would', 'act', 'guy', 'real', 'life', 'Nobody', 'quite', 'like', 'Horatio', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'people', 'misspeak', 'make', 'mistakes', 'make', 'fale', 'hypothesis', 'then', 'Horatio', 'damned', 'sunglasses', 'forever', 'putting', 'taking', 'off', 'hammer', 'God', 'something', 'fact', 'David', 'Caruso', 'character', 'very', 'smug', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'Caruso', 'character', 'Horatio', 'Then', 'Emiuly', 'Proctor', 'must', 'say', 'fix', 'up', 'be', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'even', ""n't"", 'overly', 'hot', 'slip', 'tight', 'white', 'pants', 'must', 'say', 'am', 'perpetually', 'gawking', 'ass', 'accentuated', 'widescreen', 'television', 'character', 'like', 'voice', 'quite', 'smart', 'professional', 'What', 'silly', 'though', 'how', 'show', 'show', 'perhaps', 'being', 'held', 'back', 'looks', 'just', 'too', 'damned', 'hot', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'what', 'show', 'tried', 'explain', 'Her', 'dad', 'just', 'thinks', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'overlooking', 'professional', 'female', 'status', 'CSI', 'gal', 'then', '53', 'year', 'old', 'Khandi', 'Alexander', 'piece', 'eye', 'candy', 'even', '53', 'Again', 'slipped', 'tight', 'pants', 'tight', 'shirts', 'bosom', 'hugging', 'blouses', 'etc', 'producers', 'are', 'certainly', 'turning', 'guys', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'good', 'thing', 'bad', 'thing', 'can', 'tell', 'am', 'drooling', 'two', 'women', 'was', 'also', 'gal', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'promotion', 'had', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'when', 'husband', 'died', 'Again', 'pack', 'gal', 'very', 'tight', 'clothes', 'showing', 'guys', 'nice', 'T', 'A', 'one', 'CSI', 'gal', ""n't"", 'even', 'hot', 'oh', 'yeah', 'how', 'tight', 'clothes', 'are', 'tight', 'clothes', 'are', 'nice', 'showing', 'off', 'body', 'are', 'also', 'distracting', 'sort', 'plot', 'show', 'might', 'have', 'Then', 'Horatio', 'ex', 'sister', 'law', 'Horatio', 'police', 'brother', 'was', 'killed', 'too', 'made', 'hottie', 'when', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'super', 'hot', 'show', 'have', 'token', 'Cuban', 'character', 'ok', 'addition', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'stereotypical', 'show', 'cast', 'have', 'women', 'blacks', 'Cuban', 'American', 'Did', 'fail', 'mention', 'South', 'Florida', 'Ok', 'people', 'are', 'fairly', 'pretty', 'handsome', 'Anyway', 'David', 'Caruso', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'guy', 'just', 'never', 'wrong', 'just', 'too', 'super', 'cool', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'sexiness', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'Oh', 'dare', 'say', 'when', 'love', 'watch', 'T', 'A', 'reduction', 'eye', 'candy', 'would', 'make', 'show', 'seem', 'little', 'less', 'Bay', 'Watch', 'Caruso', 'would', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'much', 'David', 'Hasselhoff.This', 'show', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'real', 'human', 'behavior', 'hot', 'looking', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'cool', 'show', 'believeability']",CSI: Miami: Season 1

820027,A18C1PCR8WUAST,B00020H9NO,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[11, 25]","Unlike the original CSI, the characters in this muddled melodrama have no precise functions--we don't know anything about anyone except Calleigh and her expertise with firearms. There is no clear process, no clear hierarchy, none of the wonderful detail we get in the Las Vegas CSI, where the lead, William Peterson as Grissom, hands out assignments even, so we know exactly what everyone's doing and why. In CSI: Miami we mostly see Caruso taking up nearly all the screen-time (if he's not actually in every scene, he's very nearly), he doesn't seem to be a scientist so I have no idea why he's in the Forensics Dept., he is always larger-than-life heroic, with his manly hands on his hips, putting on or pulling off his groovy sunglasses, saving the day by first overidentifying with victims (a problem that shouldn't affect CSI's, and which we see in Las Vegas, Sara Sidle's character always wrestling with and getting chastised for, which is realistic and appropriate) and then neatly solving the entire case himself with the occasional input of one of the other members of his so-called team. He is deeply obnoxious, and the main reason I do not watch the show any longer (I really tried, because I adore Emily Proctor). The other reason I don't watch is that I cannot tell who is what--storylines are chaotic, the CSI's are always drawing their guns (a rarity in real life and on the original), and everything's always about Horatio (Caruso) and his need to keep promises no CSI nor detective would ever make, especially to children. Its absurd plots are over-the-top, and it's disappointing because I had high hopes after the very good cross-over episode of CSI which introduced the Miami gang. On that episode people's jobs were clearer, and they all had senses of humor (there is NO humor in the show as it exists on its own). Also, in the first season, Kim Delaney was grating and dreadful (grapevine was that Caruso didn't like her taking up his screen-time and had her feeling much abused, which seems to have leaked into her performance). I don't blame her--I couldn't stand him for a second, though he used to be good and was fun in ""Proof of Life.""The one really pleasant note is that Emily Proctor is an absolute delight, however little she's been given to do. Her look has changed to a sun-drenched Floridian, and she looks startlingly different from her ""West Wing"" days and first season on Miami. She was always a beauty, but now seems a natural one, not an executive one as on WW. The rest of the group is good, too, though I'm not sure what they do, their CSI levels, their scientific backgrounds. The only other one who gets on my nerves is the ""talking to the corpse"" coroner, Alex, whose ""empathy"" just seems transparently put-on. And because they're not doing science, the show's ""reproductions"" of events are usually pretty lame. On CSI, we see the trajectory of a bullet, and how it damages the inside of the body. In Miami, we see a couple dancing in flashback, as though we couldn't have imagined that ourselves.Sadly, the NY show doesn't look to be much better, and it's no surprise that Peterson, who co-created CSI, is always reminding people that he has nothing to do with the spin-off's. I'd be reminding everyone, too. Truthfully, even on the original, the CSI's have more contact with witnesses and the criminals than do real-life CSI's who are evidence collectors and lab-rats. In Las Vegas, they keep the CSI contact with witnesses and suspects to a minimum and do pump up the drama a bit this way, but they spend a trememdous amount of time on the real science, and manage not to make it boring. And the actors on the original seem fine with screen-time being taken up with them doing procedural things--none seem to be hankering for lots of inaccurate dramatic scenes with the people the detectives usually talk to once they get the CSI reports. And they always have a detective in charge, whereas on Miami, Horatio (Caruso) is in charge of absolutely everything!!! It's a one-man show with human props.My recommendation is to buy the original series, and just watch re-runs of this series on Spike, or whatever network has secured the rights for syndication.
