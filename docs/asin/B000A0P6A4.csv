Instead of showing the person doing the knitting they only show the hands doing the technique, which makes following along very easy. My 4 year old would look at the TV and then to me to see if I was doing it properly. You can pause during the instruction or replay it easily. The instruction is broken down into easy segments, including how to make a slip knot. I am amazed how easy this makes learning to knit ( I tried Knitting for Dummies with little success).

918315,A2K8LYR0PLES3,B000A0P6A4,Annon,"[294, 295]","I LOVE this DVD!  I've looked at books, online instruction, and even had a family member try to teach me.  None of those methods worked for me.  The way Nici goes about teaching is like having a friend come over to give instructions.  She is very clear and goes slowly.  The DVD pauses in places so you can go ahead and then press play when you are ready. She teaches two methods, English and Continental.  We chose Continental.  I found out why my family member could not teach me.......she does English, and I'm all thumbs that way.  So having both shown gives you the ability to select which works best for you.  The only thing for a beginner that I found difficult was casting on.  The DVD shows 3 ways of slip knotting to start, but does not show where the tail should go....front or back?  My mom came over to show us - after casting on the tail goes in the front.  This is where you will be using the yarn from the cast on your first 10 loops.....when you turn the needle around as you switch hands, your tail will be in the back where it needs to be.  I know that sounds simple, but for a beginner it was a conundrum!! If the tail is in the front, you run out of yarn!  Other than that tiny detail....every detail for knitting and purling is covered well!! There are close up angles and it is show ""over the shoulder"" so you are not watching her knit and then try to reverse it.  If you want to learn to knit......buy this DVD...within a short while you'll be knitting away!Nici covers the following:Casting on - how to get startedthe knit stitch - continental or englishThe purl stitch - continental or englishadd yarn - if you run out or want to add a color etc..binding off - how to endribbing - how to knit and purl on the same rowincreasing - adding stitchesdecreasing - taking away stitchesgauge - how many stitches per inch to get the right sizefinishing - sewing pieces togetherfirst aid kit - HELP for mistakestips and advice - tips and advice :)She also has a website, [....].

918319,A2OZBKX9BWADBH,B000A0P6A4,Charlotte Sometimes,"[4, 4]","I've always gone to the craft store and gazed upon the rows and rows of gorgeous, colorful, sparkly yarns, and wished that I could do something with them other than admire them.I never thought that I could learn how to knit. All the other ways I've tried didn't work--like looking in books and trying to follow illustrations. Knitting has always been so intimidating to me. There's even a whole new language you have to learn.I am so thankful that this DVD exists. Nici McNally is SO super sweet and she knits really slowly so you can follow all of the strange twists and turns associated with knitting. She repeats things over and over again so that you can actually learn techniques. She understands how awkward it is for the first-time knitter and she is quite sympathetic to the person who might still be confused--even after she has shown you something. Also, it is filmed really well, over the shoulder so that you can see what she's doing and follow along. The colors of the background don't interfere with the color of the yarn, she uses a bulky yarn so that you can see every movement. Also, it is packed with visually stunning imagery--piles of gorgeous yarn balls in the background,and vivid,candy-colored items. It's really pretty to watch.I absolutely love this DVD. For me, knitting is still really challenging and difficult at times and I even get a little frustrated,but I consult the DVD whenever I have further questions. Despite this, in two days I knitted my first project and I can't wait to create another one! If you're a beginning knitter, keep at it. You'll ""get it"" and it will click. You will be so happy that you stuck with it and practiced. It is very rewarding and can even build self-esteem.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has always been afraid of learning how to knit. Teens and children would also benefit from this instructional video as well. It would be an excellent starting point.This DVD is truly worth every dime.Thanks for reading.

My mother had a lot of patience to knit beautifully, but not to teach a less-than-gifted knitter-wanna-be. Over the years I've tried on my own, and always gave up. Now that I'm about to be a grandmother I decided I had to learn and bought this dvd. I've cast on, I've knit about 30 inches of the blanket, I've even corrected several mistakes. My first attempt may not be museum quality, but I'm 4 inches away from finishing and I'm ready to cast off with these clearly explained and demonstrated instructions.What a shame that she doesn't have any further videos!",5,After many past attempts I'm finally knitting!,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",2008,596,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'learn', 'past', 'mother', 'had', 'lot', 'patience', 'knit', 'beautifully', 'not', 'teach', 'less-than-gifted', 'knitter-wanna-be', 'years', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'own', 'always', 'gave', 'up', 'Now', ""'m"", 'be', 'grandmother', 'decided', 'had', 'learn', 'bought', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'cast', ""'ve"", 'knit', '30', 'inches', 'blanket', ""'ve"", 'even', 'corrected', 'several', 'mistakes', 'first', 'attempt', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'museum', 'quality', ""'m"", '4', 'inches', 'away', 'finishing', ""'m"", 'ready', 'cast', 'off', 'clearly', 'explained', 'demonstrated', 'shame', ""n't"", 'have', 'further', 'videos']",The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting
