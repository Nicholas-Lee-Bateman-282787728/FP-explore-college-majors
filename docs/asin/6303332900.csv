I was excited to discover it here and immediately watched it, even though it's only October. The plot revolves around a worm named Bert, who is new to the town of Wormingham and, because of his somewhat clumsy nature, is having a hard time fitting in. He has friends in Crystal (a neighbor who is fond of Bert) and Wilbur Diggs (a wise and slightly older worm). When Bert accidentally breaks some decorations at town hall, he is thrown out by the chairwoman of the Christmas party, Wormaline Wiggler. It is soon after that he decides to leave town, just as a snowstorm is coming. The town then heads out to find him before he freezes. It's a sweet story about fitting in and friendship, set around the holidays. It has a couple wonderful quotes I love, including ""A friend is the best thing you can have, and the best thing that you can be.""",4,"""All it takes is patience. Everyone fits in somewhere""",1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,966,"['am', 'child', '80s', 'love', 'old', 'cartoons', 'childhood', 'one', 'gem', 'thought', 'was', 'long', 'forgotten', 'was', 'excited', 'discover', 'here', 'immediately', 'watched', 'even', 'only', 'October', 'plot', 'around', 'worm', 'named', 'Bert', 'who', 'new', 'town', 'Wormingham', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'nature', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'fitting', 'friends', 'Crystal', 'neighbor', 'who', 'fond', 'Bert', 'Wilbur', 'Diggs', 'wise', 'slightly', 'older', 'worm', 'When', 'Bert', 'accidentally', 'decorations', 'town', 'hall', 'thrown', 'out', 'chairwoman', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Wormaline', 'Wiggler', 'soon', 'leave', 'town', 'just', 'snowstorm', 'coming', 'town', 'then', 'out', 'find', 'sweet', 'story', 'fitting', 'friendship', 'set', 'holidays', 'couple', 'wonderful', 'love', 'including', 'friend', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'have', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'be']",Merry Mirthworm Christmas VHS

To be sure, this is not a &quot;Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,&quot; but it is a wonderful Christmas Special that probably won't get the popularity it deserves. Burt is a very interesting character. He tries so hard to help everyone, but he keeps stumbling over his feet. It is striking that Wormaline is so caught up in the false meaning of Christmas that she ends up being cruel to Burt. Crystal and the old man are very memorable. They are nice to Burt and they even stand up for him without worrying about how it might affect their reputations. The mayor has a small but significant part. He enters and is upset by the harsh treatment of Burt. When all is well, it is interesting how everyone realizes that Burt DID have talents. But because they did not get to know him before they failed to realize it. On one hand I don't think this is the best Christmas Special out there; but on the other hand I think it is worth watching around Christmas. This is just as good (or even better) than a lot of Christmas Specials that are more popular.",3,This Probably Won't Get The Popularity It Deserves.,977788800,"12 26, 2000",2000,1092,"['Actually', 'would', 'rather', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'stars', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'quot', 'Rudolph', 'Red', 'Nosed', 'Reindeer', 'quot', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'popularity', 'Burt', 'very', 'interesting', 'character', 'so', 'hard', 'help', 'everyone', 'stumbling', 'feet', 'striking', 'Wormaline', 'so', 'caught', 'up', 'false', 'meaning', 'Christmas', 'up', 'being', 'cruel', 'Burt', 'Crystal', 'old', 'man', 'are', 'very', 'memorable', 'are', 'nice', 'Burt', 'even', 'stand', 'up', 'worrying', 'how', 'might', 'affect', 'reputations', 'mayor', 'small', 'significant', 'part', 'upset', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'Burt', 'When', 'well', 'interesting', 'how', 'everyone', 'Burt', 'DID', 'have', 'talents', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'know', 'failed', 'realize', 'one', 'hand', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'there', 'other', 'hand', 'think', 'worth', 'watching', 'Christmas', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'lot', 'Christmas', 'Specials', 'are', 'more', 'popular']",Merry Mirthworm Christmas VHS
