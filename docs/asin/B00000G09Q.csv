500942,A23L2BR07AOBG1,B00000G09Q,alex bushman,"[6, 9]","This is a bad movie not only because it doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content.  It's like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101.  Each turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their weaknesses.  Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children, and I believe that Donny falls in love.  It's been awhile since I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with it are enormous.  First, the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product.  In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments. They just feel heavy handed.  That's not to say Mikey's plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all.Secondly, the action is just not there as it was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it's previous effects of catharsis.  It felt like I was watching the History Channel special about the history of the Turtles war in Japan and they lost.  Also, the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms of death.Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, ""This is good for my calfs,"" I was thinking, ""What, is my mom supposed to laugh at that?""  As for the Japanese men who take to American living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk, painfully unfunny and pointless.Equally as pointless was the use of Casey Jones.  His character in the first movie almost steals the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majority of the film.  In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless.  So he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series.  I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed.  The meaning is always better in small doses.FINALLY, the song used in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny, action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least found out the name of that song.",2,Turtles done with a serious story? uh uh,1108166400,"02 12, 2005",2005,4909,"['bad', 'movie', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'fit', 'chronologically', 'terms', 'feel', 'content', 'film', 'create', 'Turtles', 'psychaitry', '101', 'turtle', 'attempts', 'work', 'and/or', 'completely', 'vanquish', 'weaknesses', 'Leo', 'be', 'better', 'leader', 'being', 'better', 'individual', 'ninja', 'Mikey', 'be', 'caring', 'heroic', 'addition', 'usual', 'humorous', 'banter', 'Raphael', 'control', 'temper', 'doing', 'peaceful', 'things', 'befriending', 'children', 'believe', 'Donny', 'love', 'been', 'awhile', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'last', 'thing', 'wrong', 'More', 'ten', 'years', 'have', 'passed', 'saw', 'stinker', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'minute', 'problems', 'had', 'are', 'enormous', 'First', 'time', 'travel', 'plotline', 'risky', 'stretch', 'series', 'even', 'conception', 'turtles', 'vaguely', 'sci-fi', 'television', 'series', 'films', 'have', ""n't"", 'really', 'gleamed', 'aspect', 'instead', 'relying', 'action', 'humor', 'pseudo', 'wisdom', 'Splinter', 'pass', 'off', 'complete', 'perfect', 'product', 'opinion', 'separate', 'storylines', 'Turtles', 'what', 'movie', 'result', 'time', 'travel', 'plot', 'particular', 'Leo', 'Raphael', 'storylines', 'simply', 'drag', 'film', 'down', 'obvious', 'way', 'placing', 'contexts', 'should', 'never', 'be', 'pathos', 'scenes', 'just', 'too', 'thick', 'best', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'dished', 'out', 'moments', 'just', 'feel', 'heavy', 'handed', 'not', 'say', 'Mikey', 'plotline', ""n't"", 'just', 'bad', 'allowed', 'get', 'away', 'kids', 'are', 'pretty', 'cute', 'scene', 'house', 'burning', 'down', 'right', 'war', 'movie', 'not', 'exhilarating', 'all.Secondly', 'action', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'was', 'Sure', 'still', 'pretty', 'bloodless', 'scenes', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'boring', 'Turtles', 'have', 'been', 'robbed', 'seemingly', 'invincible', 'skills', 'when', 'work', 'together', 'action', 'been', 'more', 'battlefield', 'context', 'lot', 'previous', 'effects', 'catharsis', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'History', 'Channel', 'special', 'history', 'Turtles', 'war', 'Japan', 'lost', 'Also', 'explosion', 'end', 'bell', 'was', 'straight', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoon', 'not', 'character', 'turtles', 'Having', 'bad', 'guy', 'killed', 'off', 'bomb', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'inappropriate', 'too', ""'m"", 'just', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'kinds', 'movies', 'bad', 'guys', 'get', 'death', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'see', 'feel', 'impact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'when', 'end', 'falling', 'down', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'bombs', 'are', 'question', 'terms', 'death.Thirdly', 'humor', 'suffers', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'have', 'little', 'opportunity', 'do', 'when', 'do', 'feels', 'forced', 'not', 'funny', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'turtles', 'are', 'following', 'running', 'bad', 'guys', ""'re"", 'going', 'up', 'stairs', 'lots', 'stairs', 'Mikey', 'good', 'calfs', 'was', 'thinking', 'What', 'mom', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'Japanese', 'men', 'who', 'take', 'American', 'living', 'too', 'well', 'none', 'very', 'funny', 'reflecting', 'now', 'saying', 'just', 'being', 'drunk', 'funny', 'opposed', 'actually', 'doing', 'something', 'funny', 'when', 'drunk', 'painfully', 'unfunny', 'pointless.Equally', 'pointless', 'was', 'use', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'character', 'first', 'movie', 'almost', 'show', 'times', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'watch', 'Japanese', 'men', 'way', 'also', 'doing', 'what', 'film', 'doing', 'turtles', 'forcing', 'work', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'worked', 'out', 'moments', 'not', 'plotlines', 'story', 'writers', 'would', 'have', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'completely', 'emasculated', 'possibly', 'laughs', 'possibly', 'moral', 'former', 'definitely', 'not', 'case', 'latter', 'underdeveloped', 'early', 'film', 'turtles', 'asking', 'where', 'are', 'more', 'people', 'fight', 'what', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'majority', 'film', 'retrospect', 'Japanese', 'men', 'might', 'be', 'parallel', 'turtles', 'showing', 'example', 'what', 'writers', 'probably', 'think', 'turtles', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'completely', 'worthless', 'So', 'turtles', 'learning', 'powerful', 'life', 'lessons', 'away', 'Splinter', 'show', 'how', 'meaningful', 'worthy', 'are', 'detractors', 'series', 'admit', 'good', 'idea', 'way', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'meaning', 'always', 'better', 'small', 'doses.FINALLY', 'song', 'used', 'film', 'end', 'Japanese', 'men', 'bar', 'such', 'good', 'song', 'very', 'exciting', 'was', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'TV', 'spots', 'film', 'make', 'audience', 'believe', 'going', 'theatre', 'was', 'going', 'exciting', 'funny', 'action-adventure', 'instead', 'gave', 'stale', 'role', 'reversal', 'film', 'turtles', 'legacy', 'insured', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'turtles', 'film', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'found', 'out', 'name', 'song']",N/A

The artifact turns out to be a magic scepter which replaces people from the past with others of equivalent mass (hence Kenshin's advent) and carries the Turtles back to Japan in the year 1603, where they discover that an ambitious daimyo, Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono), who happens to be Kenshin's father, is attempting to crush a rebellion led by Mitsu (Vivian Wu), who happens to be Kenshin's beloved.  A British gunrunner (Stuart Wilson) eager to sell Norinaga his cargo of rifles and cannon makes things more complicated, since of course it's to his interest to make sure the war isn't settled.  And the Turtles have only 60 hours to accomplish their mission and return to their own time or they'll be ""toast.""

I simply never had the opportunity to see it...and thank goodness I never did until now. It's incredibly underwhelming and overbearingly silly. What's obvious to most people who saw the film, the time travel premise doesn't seem very suited for a Ninja Turtles movie. The fans watch it for the turtles, the foot soldiers, villains like Shredder, and horrible puns. All this movie had are the horrible puns, and this movie has more one-liners than it does fights.No one wanted to see the turtles go back to the Edo period and fight forgettable daimyos and pirates, but that's what this plot is. The turtles just happened to mess around when April arrived and just happened to acquire a plot device that just happened to magically switch their places with the historic figures from 400 years ago. April just happened to find Casey's ancestor, the Turtles just happened to get involved with the rebel faction, and the bad guy just happened to be in the middle of a deal to trade guns for gold for the evil king. The forces of nature sure works in convenient ways.  Here's a question: how come their clothes are switched when time traveling but objects like the Walkman stay with them?  Is that just so the samurai can see the Walkman and smash it into pieces ina so-called humorous gag?The few fights it had, they were pretty unexciting, and too much time is spend on the cast causing a ruckus, not worrying about the consequences of time-traveling. Casey and Splinter are there for, well, being there, and the Japanese soldiers being sent to the present don't take much advantage of their surroundings (except for hockey).

They are trying to adapt to 1993's technology, which fails but the mouths do move better but the faces are horribly done. The movies story could have been worse, i mean for a live-action movie based on fantasy mixed with reality, it works well. 1993 i don't think was the year of these types of movies, even though this movie is way more enjoyable the The Power Rangers Series which debuted the same year. The action scenes do lose some flare, mainly due to the fact that a lot of it is real, i was amazed by the first 2 because it's so much harder to make fake punches look real, but this one had real martial arts trainers, because a lot of the guards that you see in this movie are trained professionals, and can take hits. I think that may have been a problem for fake characters and a PG rated movie. I did like a lot of the camera shots, like Raphael throwing his Sih at the arrow and breaking it in half. If you pop that into slow motion, you can see them switch shots at the last minute, great editing there. Comedy isn't fresh but it works, the wet willy was funny. Overall, a good, clean show of movie making fun, in this fair box-office movie. 42 million dollars, which i believe was the #1 movie of its genre that year, which is good in a few ways.",4,I'm Surprised People Hate It So Much,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1301,"['will', 'admit', 'costumes', 'do', 'look', 'dull', 'are', 'trying', 'adapt', '1993', 'technology', 'mouths', 'do', 'move', 'better', 'are', 'horribly', 'done', 'movies', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'i', 'mean', 'live-action', 'movie', 'based', 'fantasy', 'mixed', 'reality', 'well', '1993', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'year', 'types', 'movies', 'even', 'movie', 'way', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'Series', 'debuted', 'same', 'year', 'action', 'scenes', 'do', 'lose', 'flare', 'mainly', 'due', 'fact', 'lot', 'real', 'i', 'was', 'amazed', 'first', '2', 'so', 'much', 'harder', 'make', 'fake', 'punches', 'look', 'real', 'one', 'had', 'real', 'martial', 'arts', 'trainers', 'lot', 'guards', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'trained', 'professionals', 'can', 'take', 'hits', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'problem', 'fake', 'characters', 'PG', 'rated', 'movie', 'did', 'like', 'lot', 'camera', 'shots', 'Raphael', 'throwing', 'Sih', 'arrow', 'breaking', 'half', 'pop', 'slow', 'motion', 'can', 'see', 'switch', 'shots', 'last', 'minute', 'great', 'editing', 'there', 'Comedy', ""n't"", 'fresh', 'wet', 'willy', 'was', 'funny', 'Overall', 'good', 'clean', 'show', 'movie', 'making', 'fun', 'fair', 'box-office', 'movie', '42', 'million', 'dollars', 'i', 'believe', 'was', '1', 'movie', 'genre', 'year', 'good', 'few', 'ways']",N/A

It' so sugary it'll rot the brain right out of your head.Why on earth Eastman and Laird allowed this to be made is beyond me. It's soooooooo far removed from their black and white comic book. Okay, I know the cartoon series was too but the first movie did have a hard edge to it. I mean, take a look at the cover-the Turtles are smiling and happy. Then look a cover of one of the original comic books. They're almost always gritting their teeth and frowning. THAT'S how it should be. Not like this.Even the animatronics look fake. The first 2 had a rather believeable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera. His voice is also totally different and he seems a touch more upbeat and lively. HARDLY the way Splinter is supposed to be.The plot itself defies logic and there are massive holes all over the place. With such a dramatic change in locale from New York to Fuedal Japan you'd think the movie would take advantage of that and go nuts with imagination.But sadly not. It just...goes nowhere. I mean, what is the deal with the character of Whit. Why does he look like the great, great, great grandfather of Casey Jones.In fact, the return of Casey is the only reason I am not giving this a 1-star rating. It's a pretty wretched movie but Elias Koteas can make it a tiny bit less unbearable.Hopefully the new cartoon show and the possibilty of another (harder) movie will cancel this one out. It's nothing but dated, mindless fodder for under-fives. At the risk of repeating myself; this is NOT how the Turtles shoud be.Extras are almost non-existant but the animated menus are cool. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is in pretty good shape but the Dolby 5.1 track isn't up to much I'm afraid. The film was orginally recorded in Dolby SR so this is obviously a remastering job.

500956,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B00000G09Q,JRP,"[0, 0]","Finally I'm doing 20 years ago review for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III this has been the 1st time I have seen this movie since 93 or 94 seeing it again after so long I don't care for this movie. I don't love it I don't hate it's 1 of those movies I can sit through as a way to pass the time. It does have it's fair share of problems. Made on a budget of $21 million made $42 million it was somewhat of a hit. Directed by Stuard Gillard he has directed mostly Disney TV Movies wow what a great director. He also directed War Games 2 wow again. The movie stars Stuard Wilson as Walker, Paige Turco as April O'Neil, Elias Koteas as Casey Jones &Whit.; This time Raphael is played by Matt Hall. Donatello is played by Jim Roposa. Michaelanglo is now played by David Fraser. Leonardo is stil played by Mark Caso. Brian Tochi & Robbie Rist still voice Leonardo & Michaelanglo. Corey Feldman returns to voice Donatello. Tim Kellnher now voices Raphael. James Murry replaces Kevin Clash as Splinter. Henry Hayashi as Kenshin, Vivan Wu as Mitsu, Sub Shimono as Norinaga & Travis A Moon as Yoshi. The story is you have this war going in Japan in the year 1603 meanwhile in the present meanwhile April O'Neil brings some gifts to the turtles 1 of the gifts is a scepter. BTW the costumes & animatronics are sub standard no where near as good as the 1st 2 movies. You go back to 1603 Japan where you're introduced to this guy named Kenshin who doesn't agree with his Father Norinaga who is in this war with a group of resistance fighter. A Weapon's Trader named Walker sells guns & cannon's to help beat the resistance. Kenshin finds this scepter where he is sent to the future & April is sent to the past. Norinaga thinks that April is a withch & has her locked up with this guy named Whit. Meanwhile Michaelanglo gets Casey Jones who doesn't do ad  a  m  n thing in this movie. You have the turtles go back in time to get April & 4 of Norinaga's Honor Gaurds end up i the present. The turtles go to 1603 where they arrive on horse back Michaelanglo can't ride a horse he gets lost he's knocked out by Mitsu the other 3 turtles pose as Norinaga's Honor Gaurd's  get in the castle they find April & release Whit they escape through this storm drain thing. While looking for Michaelanglo they're attacked by Mitsu's Warriors this is a pretty good gfight scene. Raphael uses his Sai to stop Mitsu from firing an arrow. She stops her men from fighting when she sees the turtles look the same as the 1 they got. She takes them to her village where she sees that it's under attack by Walker & he has a fire set in the village there is this little boy named Yoshi who is trapped in 1 of the burning huts. Michaelanglo who has recovered calls Walker Clint Eastwood. Walker escapes not much of a fight scene here. Michaelanglo goes in the burning hut & saves Yoshi I do like the line ""Kurt Russell eat your heart out."" Meanwhile in the present you have Casey Jones doing nothing The Honor Gaurds along with Kenshin are growing impatient & are growing violent so Casey Jones turns on The TV & they watch a hockey games. Raphael becomes friends with Yoshi. Yoshi has the sceptar & gives it to Rahael. Whit reveals that he's working with Walker he has Mitsu at knife point & he wants the sceptar so they have no choice also they want Kenshin back. You get to the finish where the turtles come from under the storm drain they also pull this big gaurd & toss him out of the storm drain they save Mitsu. The turtles go upstairs take down some of Norinaga's gaurds. They find a scorll that has them depicted as acient warriors. Mitsu & Norinaga want a fight to the death Michaelanglo steps in & stops that. They get outside where they battle some samuri's & you do get some good martial arts in this scene at 1st I thought this fight was kind of bad with Leonardo & Norinaga but it's the leader finally taking down a main villain by himself. Walker wants his men to shoot the turtles Whit turns against him is Whit The Lex Luger of this movie or what cause back in the mid to late 90's he always turned his back on his friends at the drop of the hat. Leonardo tells Walker why don't you shoot us. Walker goes to fire a cannon the turtles dunked their heads into their shells. Walker has the sceptar the turtles want it back he throws it off the top of thee castle Walker tries to escape Whit fires a catapult at him Walker falls to his death into the sea. Michaelanglo & Raphael want to stay especially Michaelanglo cause he has a thing for Mitsu. They convince him to go back to their time. They go back to the present & The 4 Honor Gaurds & Kenshin go back to their time Kenshin & Mitsu reunite. That's pretty much the movie I know that I didn't do a good job explaining the plot it isn't much it's run of the mill it felt like some of the actors didn't want to be there imo. The costume's & animatronics are sub par but atleast they are practical I'll give them that. Casey Jones had nothing to do. The villains for the most part are forgettable. Even if they had brought Shredder back I don't think it would be much of a differance cause you would be reusing an enemey for the 3rd time. The is even more of a step down by John Du Prez. The fight scenes are still good as well as the family unit of the turtles are still there. I give them credit for trying to do something different.  Stuart Gillard was not a good choice he seems like a hack. Stuart Wilson is actually pretty good. Elias Koteas felt wasted in both roles he played. Casey Jones had nothing to do & I didn't care for The Whit character. Sab Shimono was mediocore. Same for Henry Hayashi. Vivan Wu was decent. Travis A Moon was alright. The actors that had to play the turtles do a decent job. The voice acting by Brian Tochi  Robbie Rist Corey Feldman & Tim Kellenher is pretty good. James Murry did ok voicing Splinter. Overall an average movie & is a good way to pass the time. I'm sure they have released a box set for The Ninja Turtles movies so if you want to see part III I guess get it cause you would get the other 2 movies.

I thought this was a solid Ninja Turtle movie; I loved it when I was younger and still today I find it entertaining.  Like it or not, this is the way the great live action trilogy came to an end.  After this we had to wait years for TMNT, and that wait was not worth it.  I don't know why it is so hard for some to appreciate this movie (I am still appauled by the amount of people who disliked Secret of the Ooze!!!)Is the writing weaker than the previous movies?  Yes.  Is this a strong finish for the trilogy?  No.  However, I think all of the Turtle quality is there.  One complaint I see is that the Turtle's mouths don't line up with the words well.  In my opinion, no more so than in Turtles 1 and 2.  I never even noticed the slip ups until they were pointed out and I started looking for them.Someone said the story was far-fetched; the idea of time travel was too sci fi.  REALLY?! A series based around 4 turtles mutated into humanoid form living in a sewer eating pizza, trained as ninjas by a mutated rat that come out and fight crime at night whose main enemy is a ninja who calls himself Shredder?!  Yeah thats A LOT more realistic than time travel.  The main antagonist was killed of in the last movie, I give them credit for thinking up this plot.  Turtles 3 had a good storyline although not executed to its full potential.Main characters such as Splinter and Casey did not have much face time.  I would have loved to see Casey accompany the turtles, but he did not.  This is cleary a weak point in the movie, but nothing I couldn't live with.  As I said before, Shredder is dead and I like this (in a way as he was one of my favorite characters), it opens chances for the Turtles to fight new evils, not just the same old fight Shredder/beat him/he returns thing. Maybe an emergence of Crange could have been in order?  Some people say ""Shredder couldn't be in 3! He died!"", maybe Crange could have used some Deminsion X technology to revive him?  Hmmm, might be a nice idea for the rumored new live action Turtles if they intend to continue the series rather than reboot it.As for being goofy, yes it was.  Secret of the Ooze was too.  And this is why I think so:  Us, the old school comic fans, got Turtles 1.  Then, they saw the influence it had on the younger crowd.  It was a potential marketing giant, therefore the next 2 films were aimed more at this age group.  Think of the possibilities! Toys, cartoons, costumes, clothes, video games....So I understand why 2 and 3 were a little immature.But when it all comes down to it, its still the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!  Its done in their fashion.  The idea of the Turtles using a magic septor to travel back in time, save April and defeat an evil warlord was out of left field, but it worked.  You get a change in scenery, not the same old grungy city.  There are some good fight scenes, you get to see the Turtles working on their inner selves to become better warriors.  The costumes are the same quality as the previous movies.  I really don't see a reason to absolutely hate this movie.  It is the weakest of the lot but look what it had to compete against! 1 and 2?  Out-doing those would be no small feat.  Come on, TMNT was pretty well received and it was more out there than this movie.  And most importantly, this was the last live action Turtles (I don't think it will be for long though :) so appreciate.",4,A misunderstood movie,1298937600,"03 1, 2011",2011,3485,"['First', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'mislead', 'bad', 'mouthing', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'solid', 'Ninja', 'Turtle', 'movie', 'loved', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'still', 'today', 'find', 'entertaining', 'not', 'way', 'great', 'live', 'action', 'trilogy', 'came', 'end', 'had', 'wait', 'years', 'TMNT', 'wait', 'was', 'not', 'worth', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'so', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'am', 'still', 'appauled', 'amount', 'people', 'who', 'disliked', 'Secret', 'Ooze', 'writing', 'weaker', 'previous', 'movies', 'Yes', 'strong', 'finish', 'trilogy', 'No', 'However', 'think', 'Turtle', 'quality', 'there', 'One', 'complaint', 'see', 'Turtle', 'mouths', 'do', ""n't"", 'line', 'up', 'words', 'well', 'opinion', 'more', 'so', 'Turtles', '1', '2', 'never', 'even', 'noticed', 'slip', 'ups', 'were', 'pointed', 'started', 'looking', 'them.Someone', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'far-fetched', 'idea', 'time', 'travel', 'was', 'too', 'sci', 'fi', 'REALLY', 'series', 'based', '4', 'turtles', 'mutated', 'humanoid', 'form', 'living', 'sewer', 'eating', 'pizza', 'trained', 'ninjas', 'mutated', 'rat', 'out', 'fight', 'crime', 'night', 'main', 'enemy', 'ninja', 'who', 'Shredder', 'Yeah', 'LOT', 'more', 'realistic', 'time', 'travel', 'main', 'antagonist', 'was', 'killed', 'last', 'movie', 'give', 'credit', 'thinking', 'up', 'plot', '3', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'not', 'executed', 'full', 'potential.Main', 'characters', 'such', 'Splinter', 'Casey', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'face', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Casey', 'accompany', 'turtles', 'did', 'not', 'cleary', 'weak', 'point', 'movie', 'nothing', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'said', 'Shredder', 'dead', 'like', 'way', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'chances', 'Turtles', 'fight', 'new', 'evils', 'not', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'fight', 'Shredder/beat', 'him/he', 'returns', 'thing', 'Maybe', 'emergence', 'Crange', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'order', 'people', 'say', 'Shredder', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', '3', 'died', 'maybe', 'Crange', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'Deminsion', 'X', 'technology', 'revive', 'Hmmm', 'might', 'be', 'nice', 'idea', 'rumored', 'new', 'live', 'action', 'Turtles', 'intend', 'continue', 'series', 'rather', 'reboot', 'it.As', 'being', 'goofy', 'yes', 'was', 'Secret', 'Ooze', 'was', 'too', 'why', 'think', 'so', 'Us', 'old', 'school', 'comic', 'fans', 'got', 'Turtles', '1', 'Then', 'saw', 'influence', 'had', 'younger', 'crowd', 'was', 'potential', 'marketing', 'giant', 'next', '2', 'films', 'were', 'aimed', 'more', 'age', 'group', 'Think', 'possibilities', 'Toys', 'cartoons', 'costumes', 'clothes', 'video', 'games', '.So', 'understand', 'why', '2', '3', 'were', 'little', 'immature.But', 'when', 'down', 'still', 'Teenage', 'Mutant', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'done', 'fashion', 'idea', 'Turtles', 'using', 'magic', 'septor', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'save', 'April', 'defeat', 'evil', 'warlord', 'was', 'left', 'field', 'worked', 'get', 'change', 'scenery', 'not', 'same', 'old', 'grungy', 'city', 'are', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'get', 'see', 'Turtles', 'working', 'inner', 'selves', 'become', 'better', 'warriors', 'costumes', 'are', 'same', 'quality', 'previous', 'movies', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'reason', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'movie', 'weakest', 'lot', 'look', 'what', 'had', 'compete', '1', '2', 'Out-doing', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'small', 'feat', 'Come', 'TMNT', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'received', 'was', 'more', 'there', 'movie', 'most', 'importantly', 'was', 'last', 'live', 'action', 'Turtles', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'so', 'appreciate']",N/A

True, Casey Jones had a very minor role, it didn't take place in New York, the idea of going back in time seemed a bit weird, Kevin Clash did not return to do Splinter, the acting seemed a bit childish at times, and it was not as dark as the first two movies. However, being a long time fan of Ninja Turtles, I can somewhat overlook those flaws. The humor was a little cheezy but in a funny sort of way. One definate plus to TMNT 3 is that the turtles used their weapons more than they did in the TMNT 2. Also, ""Turtles in Time"" takes a break from the original plot and makes for a new adventure. A year ago, my review of this movie was somewhat negative due to being 5 years since I watched it last. Seven people gave feedback toward my previous review and found it helpful. I appreciate those feedbacks but I recently watched TMNT 3 again and have come to like the movie for what it is. Though ""Turtles in Time"" should not have been an end to the series, the movie is still entertaining to watch in my opinion. As for the DVD version, the features aren't very impressive. If you still own the VHS version, don't bother replacing it with the DVD unless your VHS copy has worn out over the years. Apparently a 4th TMNT movie is coming out in early 2004. I don't know whether it will be animated or live action but that should give Ninja Turtle fans something to look foward to next year. Hopefully, the 4th movie will be geared more towards teens as well as adults unlike the previous sequels which were mainly for die-hard Ninja Turtle fans only.",3,could have been better...,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,1627,"['movie', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'added', 'up', 'TMNT', '1', '2', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'True', 'Casey', 'Jones', 'had', 'very', 'minor', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'idea', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'seemed', 'bit', 'weird', 'Kevin', 'Clash', 'did', 'not', 'return', 'do', 'Splinter', 'acting', 'seemed', 'bit', 'childish', 'times', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'dark', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'However', 'being', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Ninja', 'Turtles', 'can', 'somewhat', 'overlook', 'flaws', 'humor', 'was', 'little', 'cheezy', 'funny', 'sort', 'way', 'One', 'definate', 'TMNT', '3', 'turtles', 'used', 'weapons', 'more', 'did', 'TMNT', '2', 'Also', 'Turtles', 'Time', 'break', 'original', 'plot', 'new', 'adventure', 'year', 'ago', 'review', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'negative', 'due', 'being', '5', 'years', 'watched', 'last', 'Seven', 'people', 'gave', 'feedback', 'previous', 'review', 'found', 'helpful', 'appreciate', 'feedbacks', 'recently', 'watched', 'TMNT', '3', 'again', 'have', 'come', 'movie', 'what', 'Turtles', 'Time', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'end', 'series', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'opinion', 'DVD', 'version', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'impressive', 'still', 'own', 'VHS', 'version', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'replacing', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'copy', 'worn', 'out', 'years', 'Apparently', '4th', 'TMNT', 'movie', 'coming', 'out', 'early', '2004', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'will', 'be', 'animated', 'live', 'action', 'should', 'give', 'Ninja', 'Turtle', 'fans', 'something', 'look', 'foward', 'next', 'year', 'Hopefully', '4th', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'geared', 'more', 'towards', 'teens', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'previous', 'sequels', 'were', 'mainly', 'die-hard', 'Ninja', 'Turtle', 'only']",N/A
