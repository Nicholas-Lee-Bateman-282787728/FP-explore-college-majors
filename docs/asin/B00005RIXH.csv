The poses are show in two different abilities, which is good especially if you're a beginner.  I have no doubt that if you do this video often, along with a healthy diet, you'll lose weight and become stronger.  The only thing I really didn't like about this video was that there isn't a cool down period.  It says there is but it only consists of sitting on the floor, then that's the end.",4,Intense Workout,1058140800,"07 14, 2003",2003,525,"['Wow..', 'now', 'workout', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'ever', 'sweat', 'yoga', 'class', 'have', 'actually', 'had', 'comparable', 'workouts', 'gym', 'poses', 'are', 'show', 'two', 'different', 'abilities', 'good', 'especially', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'have', 'doubt', 'do', 'video', 'often', 'healthy', 'diet', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'weight', 'become', 'stronger', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'video', 'was', ""n't"", 'cool', 'down', 'period', 'only', 'sitting', 'floor', 'then', 'end']",Yoga Zone - Fat Burning

679739,A17TDSX354MP7Y,B00005RIXH,CPTScott,"[63, 64]","I've been doing yoga everyday for about many years and like to use a variety of styles (Ashtanga/Power, Total Yoga Flow and more Gentle routines as well). I've also got quite a large collection of videos (over 60) that I rotate depending on how my energy level is so I feel got a pretty good basis for comparison.Of the Yoga Zone videos I have this is definitely one of the more challenging one's that I've done. It is comprised of two 20 minute routines each of which can be used as a complete routine or combined together if you like.I would say that this is NOT for beginners but those with more experience doing yoga. Also, and this is very important, I would not try doing this video without doing some warmups first. I do a series of Sun Salutations (about 3 half salutes (gradually working myself lower), 2 lunge salutes, then one salutation A and B) before doing either of these routines. Another way you could warm up is to do Rodney Yee's AM Yoga for beginners which takes about 15 minutes but should open you up enough. Of course this certainly extends the length of time but I think many people could get hurt if they aren't warmed up before doing either of the routines on this tape (The second routine in particular is very intense on the lower body, particularly the hips and hamstrings which could get injured if not warmed up first).Also, there is no relaxation at the end so you'll need to add that at the end (and I'd surely recommend at least a short relaxation to let yourself integrate the routine).I really like the Yoga zone tapes, particularly the ones that have the 20 minute routines because I like to alternate various tapes each day to have variety and work the body in different ways (and levels of intensity). In fact I liked their tapes so much that I ordered the 5 pack basics set to have more of their routines to throw into the mix.If you want challenging and yet relatively short Power Yoga type routines I would highly recommend Rodneys Power Yoga For Beginners 3 pack, particularly the Flexibility and Stamina tapes (the 3rd, Strength is definitely more for intermediate level students). These tapes do warm you up much better and are very balanced routines and yet only take about 25 minutes or so.Another series I'd recommend is by Rainbeau Mars called ""Sacred Yoga"". It's a four tape set in a vinyasa flow style called ""Sacred Yoga"". The first two tapes are more gentle ""For Beginners"" and ""Pure Tranquility"" and the last two are more challenging ""Pure Power"" and ""Pure Sweat"". These are highly recommended also and are about 30-35 minutes long!I hope this helps :)Namaste'",5,Very Challenging but very doable!,1028764800,"08 8, 2002",2002,2614,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'yoga', 'everyday', 'about', 'many', 'years', 'use', 'variety', 'styles', 'Ashtanga/Power', 'Total', 'Yoga', 'Flow', 'more', 'Gentle', 'routines', 'as', 'well', ""'ve"", 'also', 'got', 'quite', 'large', 'collection', 'videos', '60', 'rotate', 'depending', 'how', 'energy', 'level', 'so', 'feel', 'got', 'pretty', 'good', 'basis', 'comparison.Of', 'Yoga', 'Zone', 'videos', 'have', 'definitely', 'one', 'more', 'challenging', 'one', ""'ve"", 'done', 'comprised', 'two', '20', 'minute', 'routines', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'complete', 'routine', 'combined', 'together', 'like.I', 'would', 'say', 'NOT', 'beginners', 'more', 'experience', 'doing', 'yoga', 'Also', 'very', 'important', 'would', 'not', 'try', 'doing', 'video', 'doing', 'warmups', 'first', 'do', 'series', 'Sun', 'Salutations', '3', 'half', 'salutes', 'gradually', 'working', 'lower', '2', 'lunge', 'salutes', 'then', 'one', 'salutation', 'B', 'doing', 'routines', 'way', 'could', 'warm', 'up', 'do', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'AM', 'Yoga', 'beginners', '15', 'minutes', 'should', 'open', 'up', 'enough', 'course', 'certainly', 'length', 'time', 'think', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'hurt', 'are', ""n't"", 'warmed', 'up', 'doing', 'routines', 'tape', 'second', 'routine', 'particular', 'very', 'intense', 'lower', 'body', 'particularly', 'hips', 'hamstrings', 'could', 'get', 'injured', 'not', 'warmed', 'up', 'first', '.Also', 'relaxation', 'end', 'so', ""'ll"", 'need', 'add', 'end', ""'d"", 'surely', 'recommend', 'least', 'short', 'relaxation', 'let', 'integrate', 'routine', '.I', 'really', 'Yoga', 'zone', 'tapes', 'particularly', 'ones', 'have', '20', 'minute', 'routines', 'like', 'alternate', 'various', 'tapes', 'day', 'have', 'variety', 'work', 'body', 'different', 'ways', 'levels', 'intensity', 'fact', 'liked', 'tapes', 'so', 'much', 'ordered', '5', 'pack', 'basics', 'set', 'have', 'more', 'routines', 'throw', 'mix.If', 'want', 'challenging', 'yet', 'relatively', 'short', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'type', 'routines', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Rodneys', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Beginners', '3', 'pack', 'particularly', 'Flexibility', 'Stamina', 'tapes', '3rd', 'Strength', 'definitely', 'more', 'intermediate', 'level', 'students', 'tapes', 'do', 'warm', 'up', 'much', 'better', 'are', 'very', 'balanced', 'routines', 'yet', 'only', 'take', '25', 'minutes', 'so.Another', 'series', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'Rainbeau', 'Mars', 'called', 'Sacred', 'Yoga', 'four', 'tape', 'set', 'vinyasa', 'flow', 'style', 'called', 'Sacred', 'Yoga', 'first', 'two', 'tapes', 'are', 'more', 'gentle', 'Beginners', 'Pure', 'Tranquility', 'last', 'two', 'are', 'more', 'challenging', 'Pure', 'Power', 'Pure', 'Sweat', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'also', 'are', '30-35', 'minutes', 'long', 'hope', 'Namaste']",Yoga Zone - Fat Burning
679740,A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,B00005RIXH,"Deb Nam-Krane ""dnkboston""","[34, 35]","This is an inexpensive little tape that has two compact workouts.  I've been having a problem the last few days getting in any more than 20 minutes, so the format is perfect for me.The first workout begins with Cat-Chaturanga (think Active Moving Cat with a half yoga-pushup)- one of my favorites.  Then we move onto Scooping, which starts in Downward Facing Dog, progresses to a pushup while you're in an inverted V (it's more difficult than it sounds), then moves to Upward Dog and lowers to the floor.  Afterwards they show a lunge to low lunge sequence with a twist included two or three times.  The last one is very challenging, and people should feel good about using the modification with the knee on the floor.  Once we get to the floor, we go into table top and then twists.  It doesn't sound like a lot, but you're muscles and heart are working.The second segment is done standing.  Like Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance, this routine includes a lot of chairs.  They use various asanas between the chairs (that's how it felt).  First is one with a lunge, then one with a hovering lunge (this was difficult), then 45-degree warrior.  For the last one they get some targeted upper body work by pulling the elbows to shoulder height, then extending again.  All while your front knee is bent 45-degrees.  You really feel this.These are very challenging workouts.  I agree with the other reviewer that something a little more &quot;warming&quot; like a sun salutation would have worked well here, and a relaxation would be welcome at the end of the second segment.  However, I think that would have defeated the purpose of a 20 minute fat burning routine, and since that was one of the big attractions for me, I can't complain.Recommended for time-crunched people who want a yoga challenge.",5,Nice bang for the buck,1039478400,"12 10, 2002",2002,1800,"['inexpensive', 'little', 'tape', 'two', 'compact', 'workouts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'having', 'problem', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'getting', 'more', '20', 'minutes', 'format', 'perfect', 'me.The', 'first', 'begins', 'Cat-Chaturanga', 'think', 'Active', 'Moving', 'Cat', 'half', 'yoga-pushup', 'one', 'favorites', 'Then', 'move', 'Scooping', 'Downward', 'Facing', 'Dog', 'pushup', ""'re"", 'inverted', 'V', 'more', 'difficult', 'then', 'Upward', 'Dog', 'lowers', 'floor', 'show', 'lunge', 'low', 'lunge', 'sequence', 'twist', 'included', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'last', 'one', 'very', 'challenging', 'people', 'should', 'feel', 'good', 'using', 'modification', 'knee', 'floor', 'get', 'floor', 'go', 'table', 'top', 'then', 'twists', ""n't"", 'sound', 'lot', ""'re"", 'muscles', 'heart', 'are', 'working.The', 'second', 'segment', 'done', 'standing', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Strength', 'Endurance', 'routine', 'lot', 'chairs', 'use', 'various', 'asanas', 'chairs', 'how', 'felt', 'First', 'one', 'lunge', 'then', 'one', 'hovering', 'lunge', 'was', 'difficult', 'then', '45-degree', 'warrior', 'last', 'one', 'get', 'targeted', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'pulling', 'elbows', 'shoulder', 'height', 'then', 'extending', 'again', 'All', 'front', 'knee', 'bent', '45-degrees', 'really', 'feel', 'this.These', 'are', 'very', 'challenging', 'workouts', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewer', 'something', 'little', 'more', 'quot', 'warming', 'quot', 'sun', 'salutation', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'well', 'here', 'relaxation', 'would', 'be', 'welcome', 'end', 'second', 'segment', 'However', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'defeated', 'purpose', '20', 'minute', 'fat', 'burning', 'routine', 'was', 'one', 'big', 'attractions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain.Recommended', 'time-crunched', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'yoga', 'challenge']",Yoga Zone - Fat Burning

I got into Yoga as something different from aerobics but quickly realized it does not replace cardio - it supplements it. This workout, though, does what it promises - as well as being relaxing, it also really works you out.
