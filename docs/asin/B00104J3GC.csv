Taylor ""Music Addict & Tech Junkie""","[8, 9]","I own every Erasure concert video, and I must say that even though the stage set on previous tours may have been more elaborate, the sound quality, set list, and performance captured on this DVD is truly fantastic and stands out as my favorite live Erasure performance caught on film.  Andy Bell's voice is in perfect form and you can tell he's having a great time.  I highly recommend this release to any Erasure fan.  Very well filmed and it includes an interesting documentary film as well.

1124080,A1P0M7XSZXZ6US,B00104J3GC,DAJ,"[13, 13]","I have seen all the Erasure live performances released over the years, and this DVD is middling.  Plus side--Andy Bell is in very good voice, and puts an emphasis on his singing throughout.  This, unfortunately, means more standing still and singing at the mic than in other performances, so the overall feel is less dynamic.  The backing singers are good, and there are three this time, allowing some great harmonizing (on the intro to Chains of Love, for example)--and they are lively on stage.  The major drawbacks are the lackluster set, and the sound.  Probably due to the acoustics of the Royal Albert Hall, all the music sounds distant, in both the surround mix and the straight stereo mix.  This was the most frustrating part for me.The closest point of comparison is ""The Erasure Show"" DVD, which edges out this one in sound quality.  Since the arragements of the hits are the same on both, and ""Erasure Show"" contains more material from the superior ""Nightbird,"" I would recommend it first among recent Erasure concert DVD's.  Of course, the gold standard remains ""The Tank, the Swan and the Balloon,"" which is superb.",3,"Enjoyable, but some reservations",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,1128,"['have', 'seen', 'Erasure', 'live', 'performances', 'released', 'years', 'DVD', 'middling', 'side', 'Andy', 'Bell', 'very', 'good', 'voice', 'emphasis', 'singing', 'unfortunately', 'more', 'standing', 'still', 'singing', 'mic', 'other', 'performances', 'overall', 'feel', 'less', 'dynamic', 'backing', 'singers', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'three', 'time', 'allowing', 'great', 'harmonizing', 'intro', 'Chains', 'Love', 'example', 'are', 'lively', 'stage', 'major', 'drawbacks', 'are', 'lackluster', 'set', 'sound', 'Probably', 'due', 'acoustics', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'music', 'distant', 'surround', 'mix', 'straight', 'stereo', 'mix', 'was', 'most', 'frustrating', 'part', 'me.The', 'closest', 'point', 'comparison', 'Erasure', 'Show', 'DVD', 'out', 'one', 'sound', 'quality', 'arragements', 'hits', 'are', 'same', 'Erasure', 'Show', 'more', 'material', 'superior', 'Nightbird', 'would', 'recommend', 'first', 'recent', 'Erasure', 'concert', 'DVD', 'course', 'gold', 'standard', 'Tank', 'Swan', 'Balloon', 'superb']",N/A

They are best known in the US for their Coke commercial ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"" which they remade as a smash hit by leaving out the product name. In the UK they scored with covers of two Melanie songs - ""Look What They've Done to My Song Ma"" and ""Beautiful People"". This 1972 show at Albert Hall includes these hits and more. They weren't unlike the Serendipity Singers in the US. The image is not sharp and the sound is really muddy with lot of dropouts.There's not much footage of this group performing - and they are a completely different group than the Australian outfit The Seekers who recorded ""Georgy Girl"".
