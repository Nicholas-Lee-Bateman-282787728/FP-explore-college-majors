But I really enjoyed the UK version, mostly because the casting was so much better.  Aidan Turner is, as a ghost said, smoking hot and a good actor. Russell Tovey has great charisma and is a good actor too. I was a bit shocked at his screaming during transformations but pretty sure anyone would scream that went through something like that. It added a new level of reality to it. Lenora Crichlow was a bit too chatty and upbeat for me. I think I preferred the American Annie, aka Sally (Meaghan Rath), who had more of a sense of tragedy about her. But still I enjoyed the show. I was surprised at all the nudity, mostly...backal, but occasionally frontal. And the cursing which is not allowed even on most American cable.

The first few episodes is just the main character's going about their everyday lives as British underclass folks. That they are supernatural creatures do make it a bit more interesting. But all in all I found the first episodes boring, nothing was really happening and the locations it was filmed in was just dreary. The humor is fun at times but often it is just flat. But the series really take a turn for the better towards the end of the season. The personalities of the characters get more developed and things start happening. I also notice that what I originally found a bit boring, the extreme everyday life feel of the series, sort of grew on me and became something I like about it because it is different.Being Human is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost sharing a house together in Bristol. They are everyday folks despite their supernatural natures. The vampire and the werewolf work as helpers at the local hospital and the ghost try to deal with her death. After a while the trio get involved with problems in supernatural society at large.You need a bit of patience to enjoy this show as it do move slowly. Most of all this is drama with a bit of humor thrown in. Most of the episodes is the characters trying to deal with things in their lives which their supernatural natures complicate. This show is like a typical British small town drama, just with the main characters being classical movie monsters.

What happens if a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost live in the same house in a boring British town? Quite a lot, it turns out.Annie is a friendly female ghost who realizes that her boyfriend murdered her. Mitchell is a vampire who is trying to quit. George is a human who occasionally turns into a werewolf. His girlfriend has no idea. Together, Annie, Mitchell and George are trying to live normal lives in the British town of Bristol. This turns out to be easier said than done. The sociopath who killed Annie happens to be their landlord. The local police are heavily infiltrated by evil vampires, who plan to take over the world (or at least Bristol). To make matters worse, Mitchell is stalked by a former girlfriend who also happens to be a vampire!I must admit that I didn't really like ""Being Human"". The series is too slow paced, George and Annie are real nerds, and there's no real balance between the serious parts and the uncanny humour of some episodes. The whole thing feels very uneven.Still, the series could be of some interest to undead lovers of the vampire genre. At least if you don't take vampires too seriously, since ""Being Human"" often makes fun of the usual vampire stereotypes. In the series, vampires turn out to be afraid not only of crucifixes, but also of the Jewish Star of David. The werewolf George turns out to be Jewish, something he puts to good use when fighting the bad guys.

It's the description of ""Being Human,"" a bittersweet little dramedy about a little supernatural gang trying to live their lives in an mundane world -- pretty good acting, a cool concept, and a slow-building plot about some rather ambitious vampires.A youngish vampire named John Mitchell (Aidan Turner) and his werewolf buddy George (Russell Tovey) move into a nice rented house, and find themselves with a third roommate -- a ghost named Annie (Lenora Crichlow) who becomes almost solid as she hangs around the guys. George and Mitchell work a pair of low-level hospital jobs, and attempt to do normal things like date, go out to pubs, and keep house.However, the trio still have supernatural problems to deal with: Mitchell is struggling to stay ""on the wagon,"" George is in denial about his beastly transformations, and Annie longs to see her ex-fiance (as well as trying to find out what her earthly tie is). And they have to deal with enraged mobs, more ghosts, homeless werewolves, and the local vampire community (why are they in communities and the wolves are ""alone""?), who are planning something major.""Being Human Season 1"" is one of those shows that isn't brilliant, but it IS clever and fun -- especially the whole idea of watching a werewolf, vampire and ghost trying to live ""normal"" lives (""What is it about us that says 'we need jam'?""). And the writers have some fun mocking the cliches of the urban fantasy genre (where else will you see a ""little old lady"" vampire?) while also delving into the painful issues of temptation, loss, and what it means to be human.The first four episodes are a smooth mix of comedy and drama, with some hilarious dialogue (""Who looks in their salad cooler, sees their tomatoes are on the turn and thinks 'Oh no, I'll hang on to those in case some paedos move in opposite'?""). But there's a darker subplot about Vampires Seeking World Domination twined with the one-off plots. And in the fifth episode the storyline suddenly blossoms into a dark, harrowing little plot. Good stuff.And the main actors do pretty good jobs -- Tovey is quite good as a geeky, mild-mannered werewolf who tormented by his inner beast, and Crichlow is very endearing as a fluttery, brave ghost. Turner is also good as a laddish vampire with a playful side (""The SHIN, George!""), but he doesn't quite have the punky anorexic glamour of Guy Flanigan (the original Mitchell... boy was he sexy!).There really isn't enough vampire/werewolf stuff on television, and ""Being Human Season 1"" is a clever little addition to the genre.

We need to set some ground rules here about guests.""- Mitchell the vampire: ""Like what?""- George: ""Like... don't kill them.""- Mitchell: ""Ugh. Such a bourgeois concept.""Maybe separately, the vampire's story and the werewolf's and the ghost's would've been too much of the same trite spoonful of the old dark and brooding. Except that, instead, BEING HUMAN throws in all three supernatural ingredients and comes up with a crackling good series. A dark and brooding and absolutely riveting series, not at all the same trite spoonful, and brought to life by a marvelous young cast. BEING HUMAN aired across the pond on BBC Three in 2008 and amassed much critical acclaim, and I'm glad to be finally on board. Friends have been pimping this series to me for a long while now.A vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost try to find a place in a human world that doesn't know they exist. So, yeah, there's an element of soap opera in this. Mitchell is a vampire struggling to stay on the wagon. George just may be the most fussy and high-strung lycanthrope ever. Mitchell and George, with an eye to keeping a low profile, toil away as lowly hospital porters in Bristol, England. They inhabit a pinkish house haunted by a bubbly but rather insecure ghost named Annie. But this isn't at all like Three's Company. Although BEING HUMAN does present irresistible touches of humor. There's a scene that cracked me up in the first episode in which George is in the woods where he thinks it's safe to turn into his werewolf form, only to keep stumbling into people. Reminds me of the 1966 BATMAN film with Adam West on the pier (""Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb!"").But there are moments in which the show is all about the dark supernatural drama, and the angst kicks in heavy, as does the sexy. The vampire and the werewolf are both struggling with their humanity and with maintaining steadfast control over their monsters within. There are six episodes in this first series (they call 'em series in Britain, instead of seasons), presented on two DVDs, and they cover a sizable breadth of story arcs. Mitchell's story dominates the series as his past is always catching up to him and a major arc revolves around an impending vampire invasion, and this sucks in all three central characters.Annie, who died under mysterious circumstances, obviously harbors unresolved issues, something she has to work out before she can pass thru that final door. We track her as she works out these unresolved issues, and there's something quite satisfying in how she achieves closure. But then, her purpose done, does she stay in this mortal coil?Russell Tovey (the werewolf), Aidan Turner (the vampire),and gorgeous Lenora Crichlow (the ghost) are all superb, but it's Russell Tovey who comes out my favorite actor and his character the most lovable. For a ravening werewolf, George is so very easily frazzled, and Tovey imbues him with endearingly awkward and often humorous traits. You regard him as the wuss of the bunch and so it makes it all the more of a badasss moment when George finally lets loose in the last episode. Tell me you didn't cheer when he ominously growls ""It got my... attention."" to the villain of the piece, and I'll tell you you're lying. This is such a good show. Sure, one would have wished for more special effects - more of vampires doing vampiry stuff and of Annie being less corporeal and more spectral - but that's easily dismissed when you're so drawn into the characters themselves and what they're going thru.Besides, where else can you hear awesome Brit phrases such as ""smash the granny""?Bonus material on Disc One: an alternate scene from episode three (00:01:02 minute long, and kinda meh); ""Character Profiles"" has our three stars offering insights on what makes their own and other characters tick (00:20:02 minutes); ""Vamping it Up""

In fact the BBC goes one iota further and sets together a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost. And to increase the irony and humour of the series, the vampire is hairy and of course badly shaved to be in all his hairs, and maybe feathers, like the devil. But on the other side the werewolf has a hairless body (and we can see him completely nude though we cannot check his public hairs) in his human form, a hairless body he must probably have shaved by some barber everyday when getting on the sound stage or on the set. And to top it off completely the ghost is a woman. You can imagine the m&eacute;nage-&agrave; trois these three monsters are.The vampire Mitchell is stuck with the werewolf George because one night a long time ago he saved him from being killed by a band of segregationist and rapacious vampires. Now it has become a love affair with no limits whatsoever, except physical intimacy of the hormonal type. The ghost Annie is apparently attached to the house they are living in because she died there. How? You will have to find out yourselves.These nice characters do not respect normal rules of the genre. The vampire and the werewolf eat voraciously all the time while the ghost is making tea over and over again but does not drink it at all. These three friends of ours have decided to live normal human lives and to mix with the surrounding population in the neighbourhood where they have settled in Bristol. The two men at least have professional lives as orderlies in Bristol hospital. Mitchell does not seem to have a sex or love life, whereas George is discovering that he can be a wolf with women and not only every twenty-eighth night.On the other hand Annie can only have a love affair with another ghost since she is not visible except for the people she decides to haunt, and of course Mitchell and George. By the way Mitchell has no reflection in a mirror, which is very commonplace for vampires. Mitchell also wears black sunglasses all the time out of their house since he cannot be out in the sunshine and George wears nice reading glasses though he should not since he has the eyes of a wolf. For him these reading glasses are a disguise.The center of this first series is the relations of each one of them to other individuals from their species. George has a relation with his ""father"" for a while. But it has to end. Werewolves are loners. Mitchell is confronted to a certain Eric, his father too, who is a policeman in the day time and a funeral parlour undertaker at night. His ambition is to bring about a complete takeover of the world by vampires. So he multiplies the new members of the ""tribe"" and he enslaves some humans as blood cows. He has to destroy Mitchell to bring his project to a new height by getting rid of the one who challenges his authority with the project of integrating vampires in society and stopping the killings and blood drinking. The ghost Annie can lead some fellow ghosts to real death by leading them to discovering love in their ghostlike life.Then these three friends of ours are confronted to all kinds of difficulties in real life since sooner or later they appear as weird to their neighbours and at once are classified as perverts and paedophiles. But one day of course a child is killed by a car and the vampire becomes handy to resurrect him. The child vampire will be further fodder for coming years. And it is not that easy to become a werewolf inside your own home, though it may become handy when you are confronted to someone who wants to kill you: when the wolf in you comes out you are invincible and super strong. The ghost is handy too to make your landlord insane and send him to some psychiatric high security prison.An entertaining series so far but we have to see what they make of it later on.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Guess who is coming to dinner tonight,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2012,3924,"['quite', 'obvious', 'BBC', 'had', 'follow', 'trend', 'produce', 'series', 'dealing', 'vampires', 'werewolves', 'ghosts', 'fact', 'BBC', 'one', 'iota', 'further', 'together', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'ghost', 'increase', 'irony', 'humour', 'series', 'vampire', 'hairy', 'course', 'badly', 'shaved', 'be', 'hairs', 'maybe', 'feathers', 'devil', 'other', 'side', 'werewolf', 'hairless', 'body', 'can', 'see', 'completely', 'nude', 'can', 'not', 'check', 'public', 'hairs', 'human', 'form', 'hairless', 'body', 'must', 'probably', 'have', 'shaved', 'barber', 'everyday', 'when', 'getting', 'sound', 'stage', 'set', 'top', 'off', 'completely', 'ghost', 'woman', 'can', 'imagine', 'm', 'eacute', 'nage-', 'agrave', 'trois', 'three', 'monsters', 'are.The', 'vampire', 'Mitchell', 'stuck', 'werewolf', 'George', 'one', 'night', 'long', 'time', 'saved', 'being', 'killed', 'band', 'segregationist', 'rapacious', 'vampires', 'Now', 'become', 'love', 'affair', 'limits', 'whatsoever', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'hormonal', 'type', 'ghost', 'Annie', 'apparently', 'attached', 'house', 'are', 'living', 'died', 'there', 'How', 'will', 'have', 'find', 'out', 'yourselves.These', 'nice', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'respect', 'normal', 'rules', 'genre', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'eat', 'voraciously', 'time', 'ghost', 'making', 'tea', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'drink', 'three', 'friends', 'ours', 'have', 'decided', 'live', 'normal', 'human', 'lives', 'mix', 'surrounding', 'population', 'neighbourhood', 'where', 'have', 'settled', 'Bristol', 'two', 'men', 'least', 'have', 'professional', 'lives', 'orderlies', 'Bristol', 'hospital', 'Mitchell', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'sex', 'love', 'life', 'whereas', 'George', 'discovering', 'can', 'be', 'wolf', 'women', 'not', 'only', 'twenty-eighth', 'night.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Annie', 'can', 'only', 'have', 'love', 'affair', 'ghost', 'not', 'visible', 'people', 'haunt', 'course', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'way', 'Mitchell', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'very', 'commonplace', 'vampires', 'Mitchell', 'also', 'black', 'sunglasses', 'time', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'out', 'sunshine', 'George', 'wears', 'nice', 'reading', 'glasses', 'should', 'not', 'eyes', 'wolf', 'reading', 'glasses', 'are', 'disguise.The', 'center', 'first', 'series', 'relations', 'one', 'other', 'individuals', 'species', 'George', 'relation', 'father', 'while', 'end', 'Werewolves', 'are', 'loners', 'Mitchell', 'confronted', 'certain', 'Eric', 'father', 'too', 'who', 'policeman', 'day', 'time', 'funeral', 'parlour', 'undertaker', 'night', 'ambition', 'bring', 'about', 'complete', 'takeover', 'world', 'vampires', 'new', 'members', 'tribe', 'humans', 'blood', 'cows', 'destroy', 'Mitchell', 'bring', 'project', 'new', 'height', 'getting', 'rid', 'one', 'who', 'authority', 'project', 'integrating', 'vampires', 'society', 'stopping', 'killings', 'blood', 'drinking', 'ghost', 'Annie', 'can', 'lead', 'fellow', 'ghosts', 'real', 'death', 'leading', 'discovering', 'love', 'ghostlike', 'three', 'friends', 'ours', 'are', 'confronted', 'kinds', 'difficulties', 'real', 'life', 'sooner', 'later', 'appear', 'weird', 'neighbours', 'once', 'are', 'classified', 'perverts', 'paedophiles', 'one', 'day', 'course', 'child', 'killed', 'car', 'vampire', 'handy', 'resurrect', 'child', 'vampire', 'will', 'be', 'further', 'fodder', 'coming', 'years', 'not', 'easy', 'become', 'werewolf', 'own', 'home', 'may', 'become', 'handy', 'when', 'are', 'confronted', 'someone', 'who', 'kill', 'when', 'wolf', 'out', 'are', 'invincible', 'super', 'strong', 'ghost', 'handy', 'too', 'make', 'landlord', 'insane', 'send', 'psychiatric', 'high', 'security', 'prison.An', 'entertaining', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'make', 'later', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

The premise does seem like the set up for a bad joke.  But, truth be told, BEING HUMAN is anything but a joke; rather, it is an interesting and unique look at what BEING HUMAN really means.My husband and I found this tv series quite by accident.  The six episodes from the first season of BEING HUMAN aired on BBC (2008) and later on BBC America.  It is a quirky, odd little comedy-drama, but one that certainly grows on you, especially if you are a fan of the urban paranormal genre.In BEING HUMAN, we meet a vampire (Mitchell), a werewolf (George), and a ghost (Annie) who end up sharing a house together in Bristol, England.  Mitchell and George are hospital orderlies who are trying to lead ""normal"" lives.  Mitchell has been killing and feeding for over a hundred years and wants no more of it.  George is a recent werewolf convert and is a mild mannered young man who really has no clue how deal with his inner beast.  Mitchell and George recognize each other for what they are and decide that they can help each other - George is to help Mitchell overcome those nasty cravings, and Mitchell is to keep George locked up during his time of the month.  So they move in to a flat near the hospital and set up housekeeping.  Things start happening in the new flat that are strange even to a vamp and a lycan.  But soon, they discover Annie, the recently dead former occupant of apartment, who not only won't move on, but can't for some reason.  The three settle down into their own odd little family, and try their very best to be what each one of them wants so desperately to be:  normal...human...  Or, at least, as human as possible.  Of course, given their unique circumstances, normalcy and humanity don't come easy, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN so entertaining.The acting in BEING HUMAN is quite good and very believable.  Aidan Turner as the vamp who just wants to be loved is wonderfully dark and brooding, but he has a lighter side, too.  Russell Tovey is just about perfect as dorky and innocent wolf who is in total denial about his condition.  And Lenora Crichlow is convincing as the newly dead ghost who can't quite figure out what is going on (although she is just a bit whiny).  The three have good rapport and chemistry, and that is what makes BEING HUMAN click.As with all the best shows, the key is in the writing, and the writing for BEING HUMAN is quite good.  The timing, the interactions, and the ""throw away"" lines all gel quite well, making BEING HUMAN something more than you might expect it to be.  If you like urban fantasy, paranormal stories, or British television, then you will enjoy BEING HUMAN.  And at the end of one of the early episodes, a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost do, in fact, walk into a bar.",5,"So, A Vampire, A Werewolf, And A Ghost Walk Into A Bar...",1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,2865,"['have', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'planning', 'title', 'review', 'watched', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'premise', 'seem', 'set', 'up', 'bad', 'joke', 'truth', 'be', 'told', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'anything', 'joke', 'rather', 'interesting', 'unique', 'look', 'what', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'really', 'means.My', 'husband', 'found', 'tv', 'series', 'quite', 'accident', 'six', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'aired', 'BBC', '2008', 'later', 'BBC', 'America', 'quirky', 'odd', 'little', 'comedy-drama', 'one', 'certainly', 'especially', 'are', 'fan', 'urban', 'paranormal', 'genre.In', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'meet', 'vampire', 'Mitchell', 'werewolf', 'George', 'ghost', 'Annie', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'sharing', 'house', 'together', 'Bristol', 'England', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'are', 'hospital', 'orderlies', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'lead', 'normal', 'lives', 'Mitchell', 'been', 'killing', 'feeding', 'hundred', 'years', 'more', 'George', 'recent', 'werewolf', 'convert', 'mild', 'mannered', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'really', 'clue', 'how', 'deal', 'inner', 'beast', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'recognize', 'other', 'what', 'are', 'decide', 'can', 'help', 'other', 'George', 'help', 'Mitchell', 'overcome', 'nasty', 'cravings', 'Mitchell', 'keep', 'George', 'locked', 'up', 'time', 'month', 'move', 'flat', 'hospital', 'set', 'up', 'housekeeping', 'Things', 'start', 'happening', 'new', 'flat', 'are', 'strange', 'even', 'vamp', 'lycan', 'soon', 'discover', 'Annie', 'recently', 'dead', 'former', 'occupant', 'apartment', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'wo', ""n't"", 'move', 'ca', ""n't"", 'reason', 'three', 'settle', 'down', 'own', 'odd', 'little', 'family', 'try', 'very', 'best', 'be', 'what', 'one', 'so', 'desperately', 'be', 'normal', 'human', 'least', 'as', 'human', 'possible', 'course', 'given', 'unique', 'circumstances', 'normalcy', 'humanity', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'easy', 'what', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'entertaining.The', 'acting', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'quite', 'good', 'very', 'believable', 'Aidan', 'Turner', 'vamp', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'loved', 'wonderfully', 'dark', 'brooding', 'lighter', 'side', 'too', 'Russell', 'Tovey', 'just', 'about', 'perfect', 'dorky', 'innocent', 'wolf', 'who', 'total', 'denial', 'condition', 'Lenora', 'Crichlow', 'convincing', 'newly', 'dead', 'ghost', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'just', 'bit', 'whiny', 'three', 'have', 'good', 'rapport', 'chemistry', 'what', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'click.As', 'best', 'shows', 'key', 'writing', 'writing', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'quite', 'good', 'timing', 'interactions', 'throw', 'away', 'lines', 'gel', 'quite', 'well', 'making', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'something', 'more', 'might', 'expect', 'be', 'like', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'paranormal', 'stories', 'British', 'television', 'then', 'will', 'enjoy', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'end', 'one', 'early', 'episodes', 'vampire', 'werewolf', 'ghost', 'do', 'fact', 'walk', 'bar']",N/A
1245843,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,B00200JQH6,K. Boullosa,"[9, 11]","I admit that when I read the description of the show, I thought wearily, ""Oh, no, not more vampires and werewolves. . .!""  But I took a chance and am now totally addicted to this funny, sad, and gruesome show, which is expertly served up by its writers, producers, and cast.  The US, as usual, has followed along with its own version, whose first episode I saw recently.  It's not as good as the British version.  It lacks the edginess, gritty feel, dirty language, and even honest sadness that, amazingly, found its way into the BBC original.  The American version, as usual, is filled with people who are too pretty and resemble magazine models half-heartedly made up to look as if they aren't.I blew through Season 1 and Season 2 - as I have a region-free DVD I was able to order a much less expensive set than is being offered here, and am now nothing short of desperate for Season 3 to come out.Russell Tovey (George, a werewolf, probably the first ever one who is also Jewish), Lenora Crichlow (Annie, a ghost who can't figure out why she hasn't been able to ""pass on"") and Aidan Turner (Mitchell, a vampire trying to break the blood habit) are sharing a house in Bristol, trying hard to cope with their unsought-for and rather blighted supernatural lots, seeking some semblance of normal lives and companionship.  The show's first great asset is how nicely balanced the three protagonists are: Mitchell is intense and sultry, George is earnest and conscientious, and Annie is haplessly, charmingly, guileless. The script does well playing the characters' quasi-normal issues off parallel ordinary life situations: love affairs, jobs, friendship tensions, crimes of the heart . . . . and playfully referencing real history and popular culture: the evil head of the local vampire chapter refers scathingly to Annie as ""Casper"" and talks about Darwinism to justify his intention of turning the whole world nosferatu; when the three flee Bristol for digs in a former hotel in Wales, Mitchell hits the bell at the front desk and snaps, ""Basil!"" (a reference to the legendary series ""Fawlty Towers"").There are some genuinely touching moments - in one, Mitchell's life is saved, after a vicious ""staking"" leaves him bleeding to death in hospital, by a former lover of decades earlier. Now much older than he and dying of cancer in the same hospital, she refuses his offer of immortality but gives him her blood to staunch the life ebbing out of him.  The writing is vastly superior to that of the American version - a flashback to the first meeting of elder vampire Ivan, and the future love of his very long life, Daisy, in a bomb-shelter during the blitz in London is well above the quality you will see in just about any American show, as is Daisy's despairing encounter with the infant daughter she left behind - now an old woman dying in hospital.  When Laurel, a vampire created by Mitchell after, so to speak, falling off the wagon, cannot endure the loss of her old self in her new incarnation and insists that Mitchell help despatch her with a stake, one is truly sorry to see her leave the show.There are a few glaringly unaddressed issues: why do some commonly held myths about vampires apply (religious icons fend them off, they must be invited in before they can cross the threshold of a dwelling place, etc.), while others don't, most notably that they walk around in broad daylight without being burnt to crisps.But apart from easily overlooked nits, I enjoyed the series immensely.  It was a huge hit in Britain and something of a cult hit here in the United States, and it is unfortunate that all the principal characters except for Lenora Crichlow left the show after Season 3.

They desperately want to simply fit in, beaccepted and not hurt anyone.  It's got a lot of dry wit, and real emotions as well, with strong performances throughout.Someone remarked it's like `Seinfeld' with undead characters, and that is part of the appeal early on, seeing these kinds ofcharacters more in human, often humorous ways than in scary supernatural ones.But over the course of the season, the supernatural and darker tones become more and more prominent.  This leads to aconfusion of tone at times, along with some messiness as to just what the rules of the game are for these creatures.There's also a few hard to take leaps of faith (e.g. a human character who hardly seems fazed when he leans the true identityof our three leads.).As it turned from `dramedy' to drama, and the supernatural elements began to grow stronger I was very disappointed at first,as it seemed like the show was losing what made it unique.  But then it regained a new balance by amping up the emotions alongwith the other-wordly, and making the characters' pain at being trapped between worlds, and their love and willingness tosacrifice for each other moving and real, while avoiding (mostly) clich&eacute;s or the familiar, particularly in a very strong season endingepisode.

And what's more, it's not a comedy. It's a down-and-dirty urban fantasy that's quite dark -- and quite welcome. Deena and I stumbled across it a couple weeks ago while cruising through the free on-demand offerings of our cable TV provider. (Readers take note: yes, I actually just paid a compliment to Comcast. It won't happen again, I promise.)Mitchell is a rockstar-looking vampire who dates back to WW1. He's made a momentous decision: no longer will he prey upon humans. Except he's having a hard time fighting his impulses, and, in a bit of poetic justice, is being stalked by the woman he recently turned into a vampire. The local vampire population, headed by a creepy police officer with a thing for hot chocolate, wants to recruit Mitchell into a brewing conspiracy against the humans.George is an emotional, dorky werewolf. He and Mitchell both work as low-level nurses at the hospital. And like Mitchell, he was turned into a supernatural creature against his will and isn't too comfortable in his own skin. His biggest problem, as far as I can tell from the first two episodes, is finding a decent place to transform during the full moon. Doing it at home tends to break all the furniture.And finally, recently deceased Annie has found herself in a world where no one can see or hear her, and where she's doomed to spend eternity wearing the same ugly gray sweater. She's insecure and still pines after her old boyfriend. However, now that she's found she can interact with the physical world, she compulsively makes cups of tea for her roommates.Yes, I said roommates. You see, these three characters have all decided to move in together into Annie's old townhouse. (Mitchell and George can see the ghost.) Post-move is where we find ourselves in episode #1. Apparently, an unaired pilot episode with different actors explains how they wound up in this situation.In its first two episodes, Being Human suffers from a bit of first-draftitis, mainly in its inability to establish clear, understandable rules for its supernatural world. Vampires can walk in daylight, but there's still some stray dialogue that confuses the issue. The ghost can't be seen by anyone except for other supernaturals, and, for some reason, the pizza delivery boy. Things like that. But what's important, the characters and their ""humanity,"" have been well established in an interesting and compelling way.It's worth watching.",4,Sounds like the setup to a joke,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",2013,2582,"['setup', 'joke', 'werewolf', 'vampire', 'ghost', 'move', 'together', '.Except', 'really', 'pitch', 'BBC', 'television', 'series', 'Being', 'Human', 'what', 'more', 'not', 'comedy', 'down-and-dirty', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'quite', 'dark', 'quite', 'welcome', 'Deena', 'stumbled', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'cruising', 'free', 'on-demand', 'offerings', 'cable', 'TV', 'provider', 'Readers', 'take', 'note', 'yes', 'actually', 'just', 'paid', 'compliment', 'Comcast', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'again', 'promise', 'Mitchell', 'rockstar-looking', 'vampire', 'who', 'back', 'WW1', 'made', 'momentous', 'decision', 'longer', 'will', 'prey', 'humans', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'fighting', 'impulses', 'bit', 'poetic', 'justice', 'being', 'stalked', 'woman', 'recently', 'turned', 'vampire', 'local', 'vampire', 'population', 'headed', 'creepy', 'police', 'officer', 'thing', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'recruit', 'Mitchell', 'brewing', 'conspiracy', 'humans.George', 'emotional', 'dorky', 'werewolf', 'Mitchell', 'work', 'low-level', 'nurses', 'hospital', 'Mitchell', 'was', 'turned', 'supernatural', 'creature', 'will', ""n't"", 'too', 'comfortable', 'own', 'skin', 'biggest', 'problem', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'finding', 'decent', 'place', 'transform', 'full', 'moon', 'Doing', 'home', 'tends', 'break', 'furniture.And', 'finally', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Annie', 'found', 'world', 'where', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'where', 'doomed', 'spend', 'eternity', 'wearing', 'same', 'ugly', 'gray', 'sweater', 'insecure', 'still', 'pines', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'However', 'now', 'found', 'can', 'interact', 'physical', 'world', 'compulsively', 'cups', 'tea', 'roommates.Yes', 'said', 'roommates', 'see', 'three', 'characters', 'have', 'decided', 'move', 'together', 'Annie', 'old', 'townhouse', 'Mitchell', 'George', 'can', 'see', 'ghost', 'Post-move', 'where', 'find', 'episode', '1', 'Apparently', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'episode', 'different', 'actors', 'how', 'wound', 'up', 'situation.In', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Being', 'Human', 'suffers', 'bit', 'first-draftitis', 'mainly', 'inability', 'establish', 'clear', 'understandable', 'rules', 'supernatural', 'world', 'Vampires', 'can', 'walk', 'daylight', 'still', 'stray', 'dialogue', 'issue', 'ghost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'anyone', 'other', 'supernaturals', 'reason', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'boy', 'Things', 'what', 'important', 'characters', 'humanity', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'established', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'way.It', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

It has nudity because they can show it and  people do talk more realistically than the santitized american tv scene.The show looks great on blu ray and there's this is a region one set, I don't know why the one star reviewer doesn't sell off his region 2 set and get this one so they can remove the terrible review.  The main fault with this and the standard dvd set is the lack of the pilot episode which had two different actors playing the vampire and ghost. It's just lame that it's not on here, you only get six episodes as it is. The brits never make enough episodes of most of their tv  shows per season of a hit show which is short sighted too, but at least this one has great acting and is dark and humorous even.  The idea of a ghost , vampire and a werewolf living together trying not be monsters is really cool and well done.  I did manage to find the pilot online after searching hard for it; so I finally got to see it; but other than that this is a cool show that scy fy is making into a series too. Which will be interesting.  However , even I had a hard time with this shows view of the afterlife, which is a dark place similiar to the Greek theology of hades where souls wander around in a dark place with corridors etc. That's a depressing idea that may disturb the viewer abit.

The actual premise is not exactly earth shattering.  It is the story of a vampire, werewolf, and ghost living together.  The charismatic vampire struggles against a very dark past and it trying to leave evil ways behind.  The werewolf is an otherwise unremarkable person that is struggling to just be viewed as normal.  The ghost is actually quite cheery and balances the other characters together with her optimism.The best thing about the show is that what the characters are does not actually define them.  It mostly serves as background to inform their interactions with one another and the outside world.  It is very much a story of people working through their lives and problems.  They just have unique backstories that throw a twist into things.  the writing and acting are both high quality.  This is an adult show, but not necessarily because of the amount of violence, but more because the problems that they face are adult problems.

I liked the premise but found the show disappointing.Eventually I learned that the American version was a spin-off of a British series of the same title.  I found the UK version online, and have been watching it on Amazon Prime.  (If you're a Prime member, some TV series, including this one, are free, making it easy to try them out and see if you like them.) (Plus, you feel like you're getting your money's worth with your prime membership.)I found the British version (particularly the first three seasons) to be much better than the American version. It's well written, well acted, beautifully directed and edited.  The characterization is  much stronger, and the stories more involving.  It's a work of art, darker and more disturbing because the characters are so disturbingly and effectively real.The first three seasons are wonderful.  I don't care as much for the remaining two.  After the original actors left, the writers didn't seem to know what to do with the remaining ones.  They turned more to dry comedy, less to horror based in the struggle for humanity that was portrayed in the early episodes.I recommend watching the British version of Being Human on Amazon Prime, if you live in the U.S., rather than buying the DVDs, because of reports that some of the DVDs are incompatible with American DVD players.",4,The British version is brilliant,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",2014,1438,"['discovered', 'American', 'version', 'Being', 'Human', 'years', 'ago', 'watched', 'several', 'episodes', 'giving', 'up', 'liked', 'premise', 'found', 'show', 'disappointing.Eventually', 'learned', 'American', 'version', 'was', 'spin-off', 'British', 'series', 'same', 'title', 'found', 'UK', 'version', 'online', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Amazon', 'Prime', ""'re"", 'Prime', 'member', 'TV', 'series', 'including', 'one', 'are', 'free', 'making', 'easy', 'try', 'out', 'see', 'like', 'feel', ""'re"", 'getting', 'money', 'worth', 'prime', 'membership', 'found', 'British', 'version', 'particularly', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'American', 'version', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'acted', 'beautifully', 'directed', 'edited', 'characterization', 'much', 'stronger', 'stories', 'more', 'involving', 'work', 'art', 'darker', 'more', 'disturbing', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'disturbingly', 'effectively', 'real.The', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'wonderful', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'as', 'much', 'remaining', 'two', 'original', 'actors', 'left', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'remaining', 'ones', 'turned', 'more', 'dry', 'comedy', 'less', 'horror', 'based', 'struggle', 'humanity', 'was', 'portrayed', 'early', 'episodes.I', 'recommend', 'watching', 'British', 'version', 'Being', 'Human', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'live', 'U.S.', 'rather', 'buying', 'DVDs', 'reports', 'DVDs', 'are', 'incompatible', 'American', 'DVD', 'players']",N/A

Well, I'd begin by saying that the BBC (along with the rest of television) has ushered in the newest WINNER in the vampire/supernatural/horror genre!!!But could I tell you how this particular show transcends the genre for me? By simply TRANSCENDING it!!! I mean, it's something about the characters--how they're written, how they come off...I mean, they're so...how can I put this...endearing to me, that it's almost like an afterthought that they're even supernatural creatures.And I think that what helps in this, is that instead of lusting after blood, the vampire Mitchell will usually be seen lusting after something to eat. Like the opening shot in the first episode, where he's scrambling to the front door to get his pizza.And the thing with Annie is that instead of being bitter and gloomy about her predicament--I mean, she IS supposed to be a ghost after all, she goes about being happy and supportive most of the time. Like she's the house mom, maybe?What I like about George, is that even though he gets to transform into a very ferocious werewolf, his character (in human form) could almost be described as being scared of his own shadow.I mean, what I find so very interesting regarding all of the characters in this show, is that (by tradition) you'd expect them to be one way, yet they're written in a way that's almost the complete opposite.I say almost, because throughout the course of the show, particular aspects of what you feel the characters should have, DO come out. Though you're never really overwhelmmed by it. I mean, these particular aspects come out when and ONLY when necessary.I think what I like about the show more than anything is the writing. Because of how the show is written, it wouldn't necessarily need to be about vampires and ghosts and what have you, to be interesting. The whole dynamic here just seems to work and I found myself completely taken in from the very first episode, right down to the last. (It also helps that the series has a very attractive and appealing cast.) And it's something about the actor Aidan Turner, who to me, makes a very striking vampire. He kinda has this edge and this darkness about him, but then his personality comes off as being so very fun loving!I'd say with the right kind of backing, I could see this show going the way of the X-Files and hitting the big screen!!!

Mind you, I like TRUE BLOOD and have even come to see the upside to THE VAMPIRE DIARIES, but both of those are enjoyable diversions with no real subtext (TRUE BLOOD gestures at subtext with its parallels with prejudice against all kinds of difference, but in 2010 that is a pretty worked over subtext and lacks power at this point).  But if you want more depth of subtext and a more subtle narrative and richer character development and, well, less garishness, than this is a show you should check out.  Not yet available in the U.S. on DVD and Blu-ray (every time I have checked on Amazon I've only seen an outrageously overpriced $70 Blu-ray that never seems to be available -- though if you have an all regions DVD player, you can order an infinitely more affordable edition from Great Britain, which I strongly recommend, I repeat, only if you have an All-Regions player).  There are only six episodes in Season One and eight in Seasons Two, so the idea of paying over $10 per episode is rather offensive.  But you can either catch the show on BBC America or on Region 2 DVDs.The series starts when two orderlies at a hospital at Bristol decide to room together.  What makes this desirable for them is that they are supernatural creatures.  Mitchell is a vampire.  Not a terribly old one by vampire narrative standards (less than a century old).  George is a werewolf and on three nights a week has a rather violent transformation into a truly nasty beastie (and thanks to CGI his transformations are truly horrendous).  Both of them are trying to pass as normal humans, and for economic reasons and simply because they don't want to live alone, they decide to find an apartment together.  By happy circumstance, the apartment they find and move into is inhabited by an outrageously sunny and upbeat ghost named Annie.  Together, the three of them try to lives that are as normal as possible.The trouble is, the rest of the world doesn't want them to live normal lives.  The vampire community (why does there always seem to be a vampire community?) wants Mitchell to return to the fold.  They especially don't want him living with a werewolf.  And meanwhile, the afterlife wants Annie to move on, into the light, and away from her human life.  So their struggles are unusually rich and complex.What made BUFFY and ANGEL so vastly superior to TRUE BLOOD and MOONLIGHT and THE VAMPIRE DIARIES and the TWILIGHT series (both novels and movies) was what they were able to do with the premises, with the metaphorical richness of the stories.  TRUE BLOOD ends up being a glorious one-dimensional guilty pleasure show, all glorious surface with nothing beneath.  BEING HUMAN is much more like BUFFY, with richly developed, deliciously articulated stories with timely cultural references.  Mitchell's vampirism, for instance, is used less as a metaphor for homosexuality, as it is in TRUE BLOOD, but addiction and the difficulty of human self-control.The show is driven by its appealing leads.  Russell Tovey (George) will be perhaps best known from his appearance on DR. WHO and the movie THE HISTORY BOYS, but Lenora Crichlow (Annie) and Aidan Turner (Mitchell) are appealing newcomers.  There are endless polls about who the hottest vampires are and if Mitchell were better known in the U.S. he'd almost certainly win them all.  He is a spectacular incarnation of the really bad boy who wants to be good but for whom it is a constant struggle.  George, meanwhile, is like the big silly family dog.  There is meanwhile absolutely noting ghostly about Annie except that she can't be seen.  She is dark complexioned, but if you had to assign a color to her personality, it would be yellow.  Bright yellow.  She is sunny and irrepressibly happy and upbeat.  Any room she is in has no dark corners.  In other words, the polar opposite of all of the stereotypes of ghosts.SyFy has announced that they are developing an American version of BEING HUMAN.  Hopefully they won't blow it.  The BBC series is a great one.  I am not opposed to an American version, as long as it is more like the American adaptations of THE OFFICE than other efforts.  But even if it fails, it should be seen as a gesture towards the excellence of the original.  But even if the American version turns out well, if you love extremely high quality shows dealing with the supernatural, you should definitely know the original.  The only thing I hate about this show is that there have been only fourteen episodes to date.",5,Best Vampire Show on TV . . .,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,4538,"['best', 'werewolf', 'best', 'ghost', 'show', 'TV', 'Mind', 'like', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'have', 'even', 'come', 'see', 'upside', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'DIARIES', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'diversions', 'real', 'subtext', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'gestures', 'subtext', 'parallels', 'prejudice', 'kinds', 'difference', '2010', 'pretty', 'worked', 'subtext', 'power', 'point', 'want', 'more', 'depth', 'subtext', 'more', 'subtle', 'narrative', 'richer', 'character', 'development', 'well', 'less', 'garishness', 'show', 'should', 'check', 'out', 'Not', 'yet', 'available', 'U.S.', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'time', 'have', 'checked', 'Amazon', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'outrageously', 'overpriced', '70', 'Blu-ray', 'never', 'be', 'available', 'have', 'regions', 'DVD', 'player', 'can', 'order', 'infinitely', 'more', 'affordable', 'edition', 'Great', 'Britain', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'repeat', 'only', 'have', 'All-Regions', 'player', 'are', 'only', 'six', 'episodes', 'Season', 'One', 'eight', 'Seasons', 'Two', 'idea', 'paying', '10', 'episode', 'rather', 'offensive', 'can', 'either', 'catch', 'show', 'BBC', 'America', 'Region', '2', 'DVDs.The', 'series', 'when', 'two', 'orderlies', 'hospital', 'Bristol', 'decide', 'room', 'together', 'What', 'desirable', 'are', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'Mitchell', 'vampire', 'Not', 'terribly', 'old', 'one', 'vampire', 'narrative', 'standards', 'less', 'century', 'old', 'George', 'werewolf', 'three', 'nights', 'week', 'rather', 'violent', 'transformation', 'truly', 'nasty', 'beastie', 'thanks', 'CGI', 'transformations', 'are', 'truly', 'horrendous', 'are', 'trying', 'pass', 'normal', 'humans', 'economic', 'reasons', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'alone', 'decide', 'find', 'apartment', 'together', 'happy', 'circumstance', 'apartment', 'find', 'move', 'inhabited', 'outrageously', 'sunny', 'upbeat', 'ghost', 'named', 'Annie', 'Together', 'three', 'try', 'lives', 'are', 'as', 'normal', 'possible.The', 'trouble', 'rest', 'world', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'normal', 'lives', 'vampire', 'community', 'why', 'always', 'seem', 'be', 'vampire', 'community', 'Mitchell', 'return', 'fold', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'living', 'werewolf', 'meanwhile', 'afterlife', 'Annie', 'move', 'light', 'away', 'human', 'life', 'struggles', 'are', 'unusually', 'rich', 'complex.What', 'made', 'BUFFY', 'ANGEL', 'so', 'vastly', 'superior', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'MOONLIGHT', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'DIARIES', 'TWILIGHT', 'series', 'novels', 'movies', 'was', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'premises', 'metaphorical', 'richness', 'stories', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'up', 'being', 'glorious', 'one-dimensional', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'show', 'glorious', 'surface', 'nothing', 'beneath', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'much', 'more', 'BUFFY', 'richly', 'developed', 'deliciously', 'articulated', 'stories', 'timely', 'cultural', 'references', 'Mitchell', 'vampirism', 'instance', 'used', 'less', 'metaphor', 'homosexuality', 'TRUE', 'BLOOD', 'addiction', 'difficulty', 'human', 'self-control.The', 'show', 'driven', 'appealing', 'leads', 'Russell', 'Tovey', 'George', 'will', 'be', 'perhaps', 'best', 'known', 'appearance', 'DR.', 'WHO', 'movie', 'THE', 'HISTORY', 'BOYS', 'Lenora', 'Crichlow', 'Annie', 'Aidan', 'Turner', 'Mitchell', 'are', 'appealing', 'newcomers', 'are', 'endless', 'polls', 'who', 'hottest', 'vampires', 'are', 'Mitchell', 'were', 'better', 'known', 'U.S.', ""'d"", 'almost', 'certainly', 'win', 'spectacular', 'incarnation', 'really', 'bad', 'boy', 'who', 'be', 'good', 'whom', 'constant', 'struggle', 'George', 'meanwhile', 'big', 'silly', 'family', 'dog', 'meanwhile', 'absolutely', 'noting', 'ghostly', 'Annie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'seen', 'dark', 'complexioned', 'had', 'assign', 'color', 'personality', 'would', 'be', 'yellow', 'Bright', 'yellow', 'sunny', 'irrepressibly', 'happy', 'upbeat', 'room', 'dark', 'corners', 'other', 'words', 'polar', 'opposite', 'stereotypes', 'ghosts.SyFy', 'announced', 'are', 'developing', 'American', 'version', 'BEING', 'HUMAN', 'Hopefully', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'BBC', 'series', 'great', 'one', 'am', 'not', 'opposed', 'American', 'version', 'as', 'long', 'more', 'American', 'adaptations', 'THE', 'OFFICE', 'other', 'efforts', 'even', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'gesture', 'excellence', 'original', 'even', 'American', 'version', 'out', 'well', 'love', 'extremely', 'high', 'quality', 'shows', 'dealing', 'supernatural', 'should', 'definitely', 'know', 'original', 'only', 'thing', 'hate', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'only', 'fourteen', 'episodes', 'date']",N/A
1245876,A3CUBOMUPN2S4D,B00200JQH6,rstack,"[6, 20]","I'm a fan of Buffy (early years), Angel, Supernatural, and Moonlighting, so I was more than willing to give this show a chance.  After giving it a shot, I have to say it is not of the same caliber as those shows.On the positive side, the best part of the series seems to be the relationship between the three main characters.  They look out for one another, and that comes across as endearing and admirable.  There are also some genuinely funny moments on the show.In spite of those two things, I still didn't enjoy this show.  The paranormal aspects of each character were not fleshed out well at all, and came across as simply boring.  Certain things are never explained, like how Mitchell the vampire can go without drinking blood indefinitely and how Annie is able to interact with tangible objects but is not always able to be seen by everyone.  Some things about George, the werewolf, were also annoying.  You expect werewolves to be strong, even when they are not actually in wolf form.  But George comes across as a weakling.  At one point he is attacked by a female vampire, and she almost kills him while he puts forth almost no resistance.  It just came across as kind of lame to me.  Why have a werewolf character in a show if the only ""supernatural"" thing he is capable of is changing into a dog during a full moon?I also think the show is lacking in the area of character development.  If I've watched the beginning half of a season of a show, and I am not at the point where I actually care about any of the characters, then either the acting or the writing (or both) is off.  I'm fairly sure it is the writing in this case.  Either way, I was not impressed enough with this show to hang around for more than the first disc.  I probably would have at least watched the remaining three episodes if not for the profanity and sexual content.  There was more than I was expecting of both, so I'm including a content analysis for others who might like to know what to expect before watching.Expect fairly frequent profanity, including the f word.  This is a BBC show, so the language is worse than you would see on ABC, NBC, or CBS.  The language in this show isn't as pervasive as on an HBO show, but they still use the f word (along with the other usuals), and LOTS of misuses of Jesus' name.Sexual content:  The fact that George is a werewolf, and all his clothes get shredded when he changes means you will see George naked a lot.  No full frontal male nudity, but you get quite a few shots of him from the backside.  There is also a scene where the three characters watch a video of a man having sex with a vampire, followed by the man being killed by this vampire.  The vampire does not show up on screen (vampires can't be captured on video), but the man is naked and the sexual motions are clearly visible.  There is also a scene where George is having sex with a co-worker.  The woman has a top on, but the scene is fairly explicit regardless.I think the idea behind this show is an interesting one, I was just disappointed with the execution.",2,Being Human,1309046400,"06 26, 2011",2011,3062,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Buffy', 'early', 'years', 'Angel', 'Supernatural', 'Moonlighting', 'was', 'more', 'willing', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'giving', 'shot', 'have', 'say', 'not', 'same', 'caliber', 'positive', 'side', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'be', 'relationship', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'look', 'out', 'one', 'across', 'endearing', 'admirable', 'are', 'also', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'show.In', 'spite', 'two', 'things', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'show', 'paranormal', 'aspects', 'character', 'were', 'not', 'fleshed', 'out', 'well', 'came', 'simply', 'boring', 'Certain', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'how', 'Mitchell', 'vampire', 'can', 'go', 'drinking', 'blood', 'indefinitely', 'how', 'Annie', 'able', 'interact', 'tangible', 'objects', 'not', 'always', 'able', 'be', 'seen', 'everyone', 'things', 'George', 'werewolf', 'were', 'also', 'annoying', 'expect', 'werewolves', 'be', 'strong', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'wolf', 'form', 'George', 'across', 'weakling', 'one', 'point', 'attacked', 'female', 'vampire', 'almost', 'kills', 'forth', 'almost', 'resistance', 'just', 'came', 'kind', 'lame', 'Why', 'have', 'werewolf', 'character', 'show', 'only', 'supernatural', 'thing', 'capable', 'changing', 'dog', 'full', 'moon', 'also', 'think', 'show', 'lacking', 'area', 'character', 'development', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'beginning', 'half', 'season', 'show', 'am', 'not', 'point', 'where', 'actually', 'care', 'characters', 'then', 'acting', 'writing', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'sure', 'writing', 'case', 'way', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'enough', 'show', 'hang', 'around', 'more', 'first', 'disc', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'watched', 'remaining', 'three', 'episodes', 'not', 'profanity', 'sexual', 'content', 'was', 'more', 'was', 'expecting', ""'m"", 'including', 'content', 'analysis', 'others', 'who', 'might', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'watching.Expect', 'fairly', 'frequent', 'profanity', 'including', 'f', 'word', 'BBC', 'show', 'language', 'worse', 'would', 'see', 'ABC', 'NBC', 'CBS', 'language', 'show', ""n't"", 'as', 'pervasive', 'HBO', 'show', 'still', 'use', 'f', 'word', 'other', 'usuals', 'LOTS', 'misuses', 'Jesus', 'name.Sexual', 'content', 'fact', 'George', 'werewolf', 'clothes', 'get', 'shredded', 'when', 'will', 'see', 'George', 'naked', 'lot', 'full', 'frontal', 'male', 'nudity', 'get', 'quite', 'few', 'shots', 'backside', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'three', 'characters', 'watch', 'video', 'man', 'having', 'sex', 'vampire', 'followed', 'man', 'being', 'killed', 'vampire', 'vampire', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'screen', 'vampires', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'captured', 'video', 'man', 'naked', 'sexual', 'motions', 'are', 'clearly', 'visible', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'George', 'having', 'sex', 'co-worker', 'woman', 'top', 'scene', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'regardless.I', 'think', 'idea', 'show', 'interesting', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'disappointed', 'execution']",N/A

When the two move in to a new house, they discover Annie (Lenora Crichlow), the ghost of a woman who died there. Now, the three (seemingly) young people must deal with the repercussions of their paranormal curses, try to blend in with society while hiding who they are, and face others in their community of vampires and werewolves - those that don't necessarily share their respect for humans.Mitchell, the vampire, looks to be in his 20s though is actually over one hundred years old. He has a long and tortured past, and has sometimes made decisions that he now regrets. He goes through some tough changes and decisions as the first season progresses. And he becomes more likable as well.George, the werewolf, is an extremely awkward and nervous character. He is very smart, but socially inept. It's ironic that he's the most likely to live a normal human life, but hates his condition and finds it the hardest to accept.Annie, the ghost, is still discovering her abilities and limitations. George and Mitchell can see her without problem. But to others who come to the house, she is more of a haunting presence, able to move objects within the house. A dark mystery surrounds her death that is revealed later in the season.This original BBC show is dark, humorous, suspenseful, and completely engaging. My one complaint is that the special effects in regards to the werewolf are not as great as most recent television and film standards. But the acting and storylines are spot on. This was one of my favorite new shows of last year.

Maybe, but these 'monsters' are pretty human in their loves, hates, and difficulties (OK, maybe not ALL of their difficulties).This BBC America production is set in Bristol, England, when three misfits find themselves as housemates.  There's Mitchell, a hunky vampire, the forementioned George, and Annie, the resident ghost.  They are all young, dealing with the emotions of love, but each has a terrible secret they find difficult (usually) to mention to others.  George and Mitchell work in a hospital, and Annie, being pretty much bound to her haunting grounds, takes care of the house, cooking and cleaning and whatnot.  George is hell-bent on getting himself away from society and the innocent at the full-moon, Mitchell is trying to wean himself off human blood, and Annie is left wondering why she's stuck here, and not 'moving on' to her own, full death.It took a while for me to get into this series.  But the characters grow on you, and you begin to identify a bit with these folks who have problems in life, dealing with jobs, their emotional lives, and neighbors.

This sounds like a joke winding up but, really, it is the basis for one of the more catchy shows around. Here, you have a vapire trying to find his place in humanity while stasying off the sauce, a werewolf wanting so much to be a person and have things like a bate or a life or just some fun when going out, and a dead girl that doesn't really know what happened to here. You also have other things circling this world, and those things are not your friendly neighborhood beasties. No, they like to kill humans, each other, and are talking aobut a little slavery that would put pink-skinned toys in a very bad place.Talk about your surprise hits. Here you have a show that does mroe for vampires and their heirarchy than most shows out there, has a great actor that portrays the vampire well, and that has a struggle with what he is. The theme reminds me of Moonlight and Tru Blood in some ways, but it is its own entity - and then some. Couple that with the werewolf that can be downright frightening BUT that seems so easily killed when not in wolf form (and that can really act) and a ghost that really loves the fact that she can once again interact and you have a show.You have a good show.Forget all the things you know about killing them, about how o cure them, and anything else. The rules are the show's rules and they play with them. i like that, too, because it makes for something better than your basic array. I also like the fact that the show is going strong still and that the things that happen here will ripple through the coming season.

1245888,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B00200JQH6,trashcanman,"[28, 29]","""Being Human"" is another of the UK's gifts to mankind and has thankfully been imported to our shores unlike the even more awesome Dead Set, which is still only enjoyable to Americans with region free DVD players. The sitcom premise (a werewolf, ghost, and vampire sharing a flat) of this one belies it's flair for the dramatic. Not that Being Human isn't funny; it's very funny, but I wouldn't qualify it as a pure comedy by any stretch. The heart and soul of this show is the relationships between the characters and the strength they are able to muster together outweighing their many individual weaknesses and failings. The British have certainly been gathering a lot of steam on the supernatural/sci-fi television front and soon they may overtake America's offerings altogether. Let's just hope this one lasts.The cast, then. Mitchell is the classic brooding vampire cut from the Angel mold. That is to say he's a former hell-raiser who has turned over a new leaf and is attempting to live a ""normal"" murder-free life. But old habits die hard. Whereas many vamp stories of this nature equate the vampire's hunger with drug addiction, in Mitchell's case his seems to be something even more applicable in the males of our species: sexual desire. His victims are typically one-night stands, and his denial of responsibility is about to bite him in the rear even as his former comrades put designs in motion to bring him back into the fold. Annie is the best character in my opinion. She's an outwardly cheerful spirit who is trying to figure out why she has been unable to pass on and she desperately wants to make contact with her fiance, who has moved on in life. In my opinion, her journey is the most interesting and dramatic as she eventually learns that the very emotions that make her feel vulnerable and weak can also give her great power. Just a great lovable, and relatable character. George is a bit of a mixed bag. He's whiny, shrill, and annoying in a way I've never really seen in a lead character but that wussiness is juxtaposed with the beast he harbors within him, which makes it interesting. Every full moon he undergoes a grotesque and agonizing transformation into a monstrous wolf and then awakens the next day not knowing where he is or what he's done. It's very American Werewolf in London, but who can argue with the classics? The supporting cast may actually be stronger then the primaries. Mitchell's sire, Herrick, is the series' main villain whose desire is to lead the vampires in an all-out war with humanity and he is extremely well-played. Lauren is Mitchells' last ""conquest"" who comes back to haunt him and raises a bit og hell in his life and there's also a freeloading werewolf who takes to teaching George the finer points of living with lychanthropy as well as an apathetic gothpop-loving ghost who takes a shine to Annie.  Even as these fellows of the characters teach them more about themselves, it becomes apparent that our heroes are not destined to succumb to the ways of their fellows and are in fact stronger and better for having each other to lean on even if it means being outcasts among their own kind as well as humanity.The show is obviously very low-budget, but George's transformation scenes still look great. The wolf itself....well, it gets the job done and has very little screen time. The primary focus of the first season is on the vampires making their move and attempting to entice Mitchell into returning to the fold. George's attempted relationship with a co-worker who has some secrets of her own and Annie's struggle with coming to terms with the truth about her death are great secondary stories and flashbacks that tell the tales of Mitchell's exploits fill out the rest of the show, leaving just enough room for a little levity. The humor in Being Human is not as central as one would think, but it's very effective. George and Annie's confrontation with an office vampire who assures them that the only reason he hasn't ripped George's face off is because he just did ""the hooverin"" in there is particularly laugh-out-loud. Then there's Lauren attempting to menace George by telling him about the things that go bump in the night without realizing that he is a werewolf who rooms with a vamp and a ghost.  Hard to intimidate that guy with scary stories.  On the other hand there is some pretty devastating stuff in the show as well, such as an episode where Mitchell befriends a boy he saved from some bullies only to wind up being accused of pedophilia and be assaulted and harassed by the entire neighborhood.  Not the kind of attention a group of supernaturals in hiding need. The balance between the character-based comedy and drama is nearly perfect at times. Plus, the title premise is a very strong one in that it leads us to question what it is that truly makes us human.  It's a theme that is very common, but always compelling. Turns out that being a monster is just a part of being human. But you knew that already didn't you?Being Human is not yet on the level of American shows like Buffy and Supernatural, but it isn't far off.  The first season was a mere 6 episodes, but the amount that is accomplished storywise in that time is extraordinary. If they extended the seasons to at least twice that to make more room for character development and humor, I feel this could be one of the best shows out there, period. Good news is, season two is underway. Being Human is must-see tv for fans of supernatural/fantasy/sci-fi dramas. There is an American remake planned, but don't wait for the pale, watered-down imitation.  Get with the real deal.",4,"""This does not rob me of my humanity.

So the resolution on my HDTV is CRAP when I watch and rewatch the TV version (via my DVR). With the Blu-ray everything is vivid and crystal clear.

Especially if you're annoyed by the loss of scenes when BBCAmerica re-runs the episodes.  The eps go from 75mins down to 60mins and it seems that it's always Annie's scenes that get cut when it's re-run on T.V. -I understand it, I just don't like it.

1245894,A1JRUSI8U5B88I,B00200JQH6,WiltDurkey,"[5, 5]","I decided to buy this based on all the reviews.  It would have been OK to rent, but I did not find that it pushed my buttons enough to warrant buying it.First, yes, it is a rather clever spin on the usual supernatural monster form.  All three characters essentially remain human, even as their new state forces them away from humanity.  So there is quite a lot of character development going on and some new looks at how a predator might interact with fellow humans.  The 4 and 5 star reviews explain this way better than me.However...The ghost and werewolf both tend to get on my nerves.The ghost is an almost comically dependent woman who is always upset and worried.  Is it realistic, is it well-acted?  Probably.  Does it still get on my nerves?  Definitely.  Still, her story is the highpoint of this season's episodes.Similarly, the werewolf is full of self-doubt and self-loathing.  Again, like the ghost, one sometimes just wishes to shake some sense into him.  The vampire is the most level-headed of the three by far.My problem: the show is big about characters, and the characters get on my nerves...The second objection I have is that there are way too many vampires, who kill lots of people, all the time.  It beggars belief that humanity would not have noticed something very amiss.  Having so many of them defuses the tension, they're just the neighborhood bullies in a gang.Special effects:  having perhaps not the greatest budget for effects, it probably would have been better to imply stuff more than to show it directly.  Full-view shots of the werewolf are good, but it would have better to leave them out, showing him full on does little to further the show's atmosphere.All in all, not a bad show, but not quite the masterpiece some claim.***SOME NON-SPECIFIC SPOILERS***The ""bad vampires"" are a major threat that slowly ramps up in scariness during the episodes.  But the showdown with them falls flat - the special effects are just not that good and there is too much happening.  With, again, too many vampires.  It's a little  bit of a rush job.",3,Not bad.
