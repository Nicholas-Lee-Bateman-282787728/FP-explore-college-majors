1222488,A1G0IHVBEN8ZTB,B001OFFRQ2,Abdulla M. Al Qasim,"[2, 2]","Let me begin by saying that I now think that movie is even funnier since it is based on Toby Young's book and his experience in NY!! His interview is in itself hilarious!Simon Pegg has a talent for playing characters that are just clueless, somewhat out of touch with reality, with a hint of loser! He just does it very well!!! Throw that into the quick pace lifestyle of the big apple and those characteristics become even more profound!I will have to say that I am not really a romantic comedy type person, but the comedy side of this movie far outweighs the romance! There were some laugh out loud scenes for me, like when Simon coughs with his mouth full on the lady's overcoat... even funnier that he can't leave it alone! The scene where he gets smashed at a fourth of July party and get up and starts singing `England England England' was hilarious to me... what a complete Wally! The scene with the dog in the office is funny too! But for all those who said that there were no laugh out loud scenes, what do you call the two scene with the transvestite!? Absolutely hilarious!! (especially the stripper prank!) What a wally!!On the more serious side, Simon's character is very serious about what he does and is uncompromising and that becomes more and more obvious as the movie progresses... you find out that his character is actually deeper than you imagined!! I liked how the movie portrays Simon as a person who is unwilling to let go of his principles in the corporate rat race... I think the movie does an excellent job of capturing the struggles that most people have to go through in terms of either selling out and climbing the corporate ladder or retaining their morals and principles and staying at the bottom of the corporate food chain! I feel your pain Sydney Young!I really liked that the movie ended with comedic closing note rather than a romantic one... to be honest it is a romantic comedy that most guys can enjoy with their significant others! Once the movie was over and I had a big smile on my face, my wife turned to me and said `SEE! You can enjoy romantic comedies!'A very funny but meaningful movie that I enjoyed watching and I'm sure that I will watch it again!",4,What a Wally!,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,2198,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'now', 'think', 'movie', 'even', 'funnier', 'based', 'Toby', 'Young', 'book', 'experience', 'NY', 'interview', 'hilarious', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'talent', 'playing', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'clueless', 'somewhat', 'touch', 'reality', 'hint', 'loser', 'just', 'very', 'well', 'Throw', 'quick', 'pace', 'lifestyle', 'big', 'apple', 'characteristics', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'profound', 'will', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'type', 'person', 'comedy', 'side', 'movie', 'far', 'romance', 'were', 'laugh', 'loud', 'scenes', 'when', 'Simon', 'mouth', 'full', 'lady', 'overcoat', 'even', 'funnier', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'scene', 'where', 'smashed', 'fourth', 'July', 'party', 'get', 'up', 'singing', 'England', 'England', 'England', 'was', 'hilarious', 'what', 'complete', 'Wally', 'scene', 'dog', 'office', 'funny', 'too', 'who', 'said', 'were', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'scenes', 'what', 'do', 'call', 'two', 'scene', 'transvestite', 'Absolutely', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'stripper', 'prank', 'What', 'wally', 'more', 'serious', 'side', 'Simon', 'character', 'very', 'serious', 'what', 'uncompromising', 'more', 'more', 'obvious', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'character', 'actually', 'deeper', 'imagined', 'liked', 'how', 'movie', 'Simon', 'person', 'who', 'unwilling', 'let', 'go', 'principles', 'corporate', 'rat', 'race', 'think', 'movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'struggles', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'go', 'terms', 'selling', 'out', 'climbing', 'corporate', 'ladder', 'retaining', 'morals', 'principles', 'staying', 'bottom', 'corporate', 'food', 'chain', 'feel', 'pain', 'Sydney', 'Young', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'ended', 'comedic', 'closing', 'note', 'rather', 'romantic', 'one', 'be', 'honest', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'guys', 'can', 'enjoy', 'significant', 'others', 'Once', 'movie', 'was', 'had', 'big', 'smile', 'face', 'wife', 'turned', 'said', 'SEE', 'can', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'very', 'funny', 'meaningful', 'movie', 'enjoyed', 'watching', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'watch', 'again']",N/A

However, ""How to Lose Friends"" accomplishes just that.Simon Pegg's character starts with no balance. He doesn't buy into glitzy images. He doesn't even buy into being polite just to get along better with those around him. He does buy into taking a job with a large lifestyles magazine whose editor's earlier work holds his admiration.The editor puts up with his gaffs and insolence, and eventually through the Peter Principle, Pegg rises right to the top of his division in the magazine. Along the way he both gains and loses everything he believes he holds dear.In the process you get a full experience of comedy, being tested with subtle parody along with the broad jokes and pratfalls. The film is strongest in its parody, however, so if you don't tend to like strong parody in your comedies, you probably won't be lifted up much by this film.My wife and I both found it to be hilarious, which is a pretty good test, as we don't always laugh at the same types of comedies.

The first clue that something isn't right, this is a comedy distributed by MGM.What went wrong?Too long: The movie is almost 2 hours long, with about 1 hour of fluff that doesn't need to exist. In fact if you fast forward from around 45 minutes into the film, to about 30 minutes remaining, you will miss nothing - no jokes, no plot line, no character development.The Cast: Kirsten Dunst, oh how beautiful you are and how much I enjoyed you in your early films. So how did they make her look like Darlene from the Rosanne Barr Show? Jeff Bridges, never a huge fan of his work, and he is sort of likeable as the owner of the magazine, but turns in a hugely uneven performance. Simon Pegg, Simon Pegg, what happened to that insanely funny man inHot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)? I guess the trend for Simon has been downward,Run, Fatboy, Runwas slightly funnier than this. Sidney Young's love interest, Sophie Maes (Megan Fox, Transformers) is supposed to be oh so hot and alluring - ouch not at all. Not attractive at all. Until the viewer understood the joke with Bobbi, she was much prettier. The rest of the supporting cast, oh my, just not good.The soundtrack: Oh my goodness, the royalty free melodramatic string music is just horrible. What tunes do play, oh they are forgettable.The story: so darn predictable. There's some style and intrigue in the opening sequence, the viewer knows where Sidney ends up in one year. And the majority of the film is told in flashback. Normally that is a creative device I love, in this case it was way overplayed. The twist at the end of the film, well it's just so surprising. And oh, just remember La Dolce Vita.What went right? Most all shots were in focus and the exposure was right. The sound had almost no surround immersion except for unimportant moments, but the dialog was crystal clear.The DVD, slim slim bonus features. Two commentary tracks. A making of featurette. All forgetable.The film is definately R rated. There is one scene with nudity that happens to be full frontal nudity of a trans gender person. The shot of the surprise was totally unnecessary and really held much too long, along with a really sad joke afterwards. Other than that, there is a bit of language. In fact if that scene had been removed (and the film would not have suffered at all) this would be PG-13.Not too much to recommend here. It's not bad enough to be good.

First, Megan Fox actually adds some real humor - and is smoking hot! She plays the ditzy American actress perfectly. Second, there is one scene when the dog dies that is hilarious.

But, like most actors, he sometimes ends up in a movie that just doesn't work. That's the case here.Here's the scoop. Pegg is the publisher of a bargain basement entertainment industry rag. Because of a stunt he pulled, that ended in a real disaster, he gets hired on by a top shelf American entertainment rag run by Jeff Bridges. He's a fish out of water in the new job and one blunder leads to another as he tries to pursue his dream.Given the set-up, this should have been a slam dunk. It's been done many times before, so the story should take care of itself. It's cookie cutter stuff. The focus should then shift to how they use the talents to pull off the gags. The opening 25 minutes or so are a riot. Pegg is as good as he's ever been, but then things go south. This does get messy. The writer/director doesn't seem to know how to play things. For instance, in the third act, you find out something about Pegg that is way counter intuitive to how he behaves. That's just bad character development. Then there are other items that seem to be crucial set-ups for events to come later. Nope. They just let them die. And the ending?! You've got to be kidding me. Lazy. How about Pegg's rise in the ranks. At one point he was on the short end of a pink slip. Now he's at the top for no apparent reason. Go figure.Kirsten Dunst, Danny Huston do genuinely decent jobs, Bridges, as much as I like him, wasn't invested in this role. The writing certainly didn't help him. Everything else is on par with the project. This fails at the script level.This isn't a painful watch but your time might be better spent somewhere else.",3,Needed a trail of Bread Crumbs,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",2014,1689,"['like', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'think', 'naturally', 'funny', 'comedic', 'actor', 'most', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'up', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'case', 'scoop', 'Pegg', 'publisher', 'bargain', 'basement', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'rag', 'stunt', 'pulled', 'ended', 'real', 'disaster', 'hired', 'top', 'shelf', 'American', 'entertainment', 'rag', 'run', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'fish', 'water', 'new', 'job', 'one', 'blunder', 'pursue', 'dream.Given', 'set-up', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'slam', 'dunk', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'before', 'story', 'should', 'take', 'care', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'stuff', 'focus', 'should', 'then', 'shift', 'how', 'use', 'talents', 'pull', 'off', 'gags', 'opening', '25', 'minutes', 'so', 'are', 'riot', 'Pegg', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'been', 'then', 'things', 'go', 'south', 'get', 'messy', 'writer/director', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'things', 'instance', 'third', 'act', 'find', 'out', 'something', 'Pegg', 'way', 'counter', 'intuitive', 'how', 'just', 'bad', 'character', 'development', 'Then', 'are', 'other', 'items', 'seem', 'be', 'crucial', 'set-ups', 'events', 'come', 'later', 'Nope', 'just', 'let', 'die', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'Lazy', 'How', 'Pegg', 'rise', 'ranks', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'short', 'end', 'pink', 'slip', 'Now', 'top', 'apparent', 'reason', 'Go', 'figure.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Danny', 'Huston', 'do', 'genuinely', 'decent', 'jobs', 'Bridges', 'as', 'much', 'like', 'was', ""n't"", 'invested', 'role', 'writing', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'Everything', 'else', 'par', 'project', 'script', 'level.This', ""n't"", 'painful', 'watch', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'better', 'spent', 'somewhere', 'else']",N/A

I remember seeing the previews for this and thinking ""all right here is his forte into mainstream movies"". Now I knew that could go one of two ways, those of course being bad or good. Thankfully this while not his best film is really good and that is mainly because of Mr. Pegg himself. I know what you are saying ""of course he is good in it"" and I know that but I felt the need to say it, so get off my back.The film follows an off the wall writer named Sidney Young [Pegg] as he goes from wanting to be in the ""it"" crowd to actually being there. The thing about it though is that what got him to the dance just might be the one thing he has to give up in order to be successful. Writing for a small magazine that trashes the stars [or at least he does] over in the UK, he is offered a job in the US by his hero in the biz Clayton Harding [Jeff Bridges]. Once there the hero he looked up to is looking more and more like a sell out and after meeting Sophie Maes [Megan Fox] he just might do the same. The only real person at least in his eyes is Alison Olsen [Kirsten Dunst], so he tends to hang around her while wanting Sophie.This film based on a book by Toby Young is well handled under the direction of Robert Weide. The film is well paced even though it is a bit long which may be it's only down fall, the only one I guess. Written for the screen by Peter Straughan and acted out well by the entire cast this film is really entertaining. The film has laugh out loud moments but it is much more of a wittier humor or subtle type if that makes sense. Still I find the film to be very entertaining and found the cast to be real fun to watch.Simon Pegg is excellent as the lead in this film and it was cool to see him in this type of role, in fact he should do more of these. Kirsten Dunst is great as well in this film and gives one of the better performances. Jeff Bridges is great as usual and Megan Fox does a good job as well as does the rest of the cast. Like I said this is not the best film ever and is not even Pegg's best film, but it is still a very entertaining flick.

I do know when leaving the theater there was alot of criticism over his inaccurate protrayal by Simon Pegg. That might be, but I honestly don't care (I mean they changed his NAME for christ sakes!). I've never felt compelled to judge a movie based on it's literary (or real-life) influence and feel it should be judged by it's own medium. That being said, this movie was very entertaining from the opening scene to the last.As I stated before, Pegg plays a character named Sidney who starts out working on his own (what seems like) independant magazine cinically making fun of the rich and famous. He ends up taking a job at ""Sharps"" magazine (think ""Vanity Fair"") where he proceeds to exude his cynicism on celebrity culture while alternatly trying to make his voice heard and seduce upcoming starlet Megan Fox. There's also a quasi-love story going on between him and a fellow colleague (played terrifically by Kirsten Dunst---and no SPIDERMAN in sight!).While the plot seems to follow and end up with the usual Hugh Grant:Julia Roberts formula, what makes it stick out is the sort of in-your-face/bombastic approach the main character takes to the world (and the way he seems to effect everyone around him whether he sees it or not). It's cute but in a dirty-sex, scrambled eggs sort of way. The acting is great too with not a single weak-link in the chain (being a Simon Pegg fan, he made every scene watchable).This was a good film. Not a GREAT film, but a fun and entertaining one (it certainly broke up the monotony of big-budget Blockbusters).

1222508,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B001OFFRQ2,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 4]","Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) is an obnoxious womanizing loser. Sidney runs a low brow radical magazine in Britain, where he tries to break into parties after awards shows to mingle with stars and try to catch stars doing things worthy of his gossipy rag. Just when he thinks he's going to have to close down the magazine, Sidney gets a call from Clayton Harding (Jeff Bridges), the editor in chief for big-time New York magazine Sharps. Working at Sharps, Sidney gets to hobnob with the rich and famous, but proceeds to alienate everyone around him. While trying to get into the pants of young attractive starlet (Megan Fox) he makes an unlikely friend in fellow Sharps writer Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst).How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is based on the book of the same name, which is a memoir by faux journalist Toby Young. Hearing some of the stories of Toby Young, it's quite obvious that Sidney in the movie was made a tad bit more likable than his real life counterpart. Toby Young, who tried for five years to make it in the US as a contributing editor at Vanity Fair but failed, once asked Nathan Lane if he was gay during an interview about The Birdcage, and got himself banned from the set of the movie based on his own book because he was annoying actors and interrupting the director while he was shooting. So how do you make a movie about a guy so obnoxious that he really alienates people?Well, the casting of an uber-likable British actor like Simon Pegg really helps the process of making Sidney Young a character that you still kind of root for. Pegg does a great job with the role he's given too, making Young a sleazy character, but also giving him a slight bit of a genuine spirit. After him all of the actors and actresses fall in line in this flick, playing their roles very well, with the exception of Megan Fox. I wondered after seeing her in Transformers if she was paired up with a different director could she possibly be a better actress? Here, unfortunately, we find out that the answer to that question is no, she's nothing more than a pretty face, nice body, and a vacant stare. I was really hoping there would be more to her though.How to Lose Friends starts off strong, and at times is hilarious, but it loses itself and ends up all over the place. Seeing Sidney make a fool of himself can be fun, but at times it can also be painful to watch. The writing is at it's best when Sidney is being genuine, and even shows moments that appear to have a hint of ethical behavior involved. Naturally, those moments don't last as it does turn out that Sidney has a hidden agenda. At the very end of the movie it devolves into all too familiar romantic comedy territory as Sidney realizes he should be true to himself and go after the girl. I wasn't fully expecting the movie to delve into clich&eacute; territory, nor do believe that it should have gone there either.This is a fairly enjoyable movie, hilarious at times, and refreshing in it's ridiculousness while still keeping a sense of reality. I recommend this movie, even if at times it strays from being true to itself. I enjoyed it, and I'm considering adding it to my overly large movie collection.

It's supposed to be a comedy, but you spend most of the time wincing instead of enjoying.My wife read Toby Jones' book and loved it - laughed a great deal - and even when he was being a complete prick, it was at least entertaining. But the film version falls flat on its face - time after time after time. And worse - it feels like it actually admires the shallow and cruel celebrity culture it's supposed to be pillorying. You left wondering why quality people like Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson and Kirsten Dunst are in this dog.Pegg doesn't help either.

Well, thankfully it isn't (it is in fact based on Toby Young's book and own experiences instead), and the film ends up being a surprisingly good comedy, mostly thanks to the antics of Pegg in the role of Sidney Young; a displaced British journalist who now finds himself with a job working for the hottest magazine in America.  It isn't long before he manages to irk many of his co-workers, including his media mogul boss (Jeff Bridges), a snobby rival (Danny Huston), a would-be novelist (Kirsten Dunst), and a hot starlet (Megan Fox) that tickles his fancy.  What helps make How to Lose Friends & Alienate People so much better than it could have been otherwise is the direction of Robert B. Weide, who manages to coax great, comical performances out of everyone involved, with Pegg and Gillian Anderson being the standouts.

Into the ackward hilarity of social climbing in ""How to Lose Friends & Alienate People."" Directed by Rob Weide & adapted by Peter Straughan from Toby Young's semi fictional book ""How to Lose Friends & Alienate People"" focuses on Brit-born Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) & his year long adventure into the red carpet world of magazine publishing.Ever since he was a young lad Sidney has dreamed to be amongst the famous of the movies, to live in the lap of luxury he believed the actors dwelled in. In first- person voice- over narrative the film starts present day where Sydney is wearing a fancy tuxedo & designer watch, attending an awards ceremony with newly inaugurated starlet Sophie Maes (Megan Fox). The movie then flashes back to a year before the sparkle & influence of Sydney's life as production manager at the highly regarded Sharps Magazine.When not trying to crash his way into film premieres & after parties, Sydney runs a counter - culture style of publication called Post Modern Review. After talking up Thandie Newton & making an array of flash photography at a party Sydney charms up Sharps Magazine's founding editor Clayton Harding. He manages to land a job offer & off to NYC he goes. No more than four months into the job Sydney manages to overstep his position on the professional ladder & repeatedly irritates coworker Alison (Kursten Dunst) the closest thing he has to a friend. A somewhat misleading title for Sydney doesn't have any friends to lose his personality & behavior are completely socially inept noticed by all except himself. But poor Sydney can't help but be himself even if it's totally offensive & inappropriate. This film will have you laughing but also feeling empathy for him. Sydney is one of those who has an underlying innate charm that you can't say no to.

1222518,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B001OFFRQ2,Only-A-Child,"[3, 6]","""How to Lose Friends & Alienate People"" (2008) is a clever combination of ""The Loved One"" (1965) and ""Enchanted"" (2007).  A ""stranger in a strange land"" comedy, full of self-reflexive moments of mostly subtle parody, which obviously a lot of viewers don't get.  It's target audience is identical to that of ""The Loved Ones"", a tiny cult following which should have told the producers that going down this road in a relatively high budget manner would be a bad idea commercially.  Bad because the ""R"" rating necessary for its more biting moments of satire would disqualify it as mainstream family entertainment; which otherwise would have been the best choice for a secondary target audience who would buy into the film as a simple romantic comedy.The film is based on Toby Young, a British Hunter Thompson, who for a short but memorable time came across the pond and wrote disastrously for Vanity Fair Magazine; in much the same manner as his film namesake Sidney Young (Simon Pegg).It is probably the best-directed film in the last 10 years, with perfect casting and excellent acting for the camera direction.  Robert Weide really nails it in his first feature.  Pegg's bits of physical comedy and witty commentary need an audience and Kirsten Dunst was simply meant to play the role of his reluctant mentor at the magazine.  Dunst knows how to gently tease a role and is especially gifted at deadpan non-verbal comedy.  This dynamic is a good thing to pay attention to because the real laughs come from the reaction shots of Alison (Dunst's underplayed character) and you rarely see this sort of thing done so well.Weide has Pegg play Sidney as if he was ""Duckman"" come to life, relying on enough of Pegg's natural likeability to come through and make an otherwise odious character sympathetic.And surprise, Megan Fox can act (at least sort of)! Here she dials down the intelligence level of her stock villainess and channels a bit of the old Marilyn Monroe airhead quality.  She is not just decorative but contributes nicely to the film's self-reflexive parody.  If you've seen those stills of her playing Mother Teresa they are part of a hilarious ""film-within-a-film"" segment. And she channels Anita Ekberg in a parody of Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita's (1960) swimming in the fountain scene.Fox was cast for the film prior to getting a huge popularity boast from the ""Transformers"" and is pure femme fatale, a perfect contrast to Dunst's Carole Lombard inspired ""on the level"" girl.The story is deliberately predictable, essentially taking the earthy guts of Sidney Young's memoirs and packaging them into a sappy self-reflexive Hollywood love story.  But to really appreciate the film, viewers have to recognize that the formulaic construct is all in the service of parody.The DVD includes two slick audio commentaries, which should be especially useful for those struggling with the film's comedy style, and a short featurette full of cast interviews.Then again, what do I know?

I'm writing this on October 30th, 2008. It's taken me this long to come up with a review of the movie that isn't laced with profanity and demands for a refund.Weide (Curb Your Enthusiasm) delivers, as his first feature film, Peter Straughan (whose adaptation of The Man Who Stare at Goats is currently filming)'s adaptation of Toby Young's memoir about making it, and then losing it, in American journalism. I have to say that I did have high hopes for this going in, despite lukewarm (to put it nicely) reviews, because in my eyes, Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) can do no wrong.Or could do no wrong until October 3, 2008.While the movie certainly has its moments-- Pegg does manage to crack off some fantastic one-liners-- it ultimately fails. The main reason is the pacing, which is off more often than not. I have all kinds of hypotheses on why this may be, but ultimately no real answer. Which is all the sadder because most of the other aspects of the film are well-executed; the direction is at least competent, the film is very well-shot, the acting is fine (though Jeff Bridges seems as if he's just reprising his role in Iron Man). Unfortunately, in a comedy, pacing is everything, and it turns what should have been a mildly amusing flick into a just-this-side-of-unwatchable mess.

The actor, Simon Pegg, whom I have never heard of before, is playing a writer, a real idiot, for a magazine in Britain. He gets a call to come to New York to write for a magazine run by a guy, played by Jeff Bridges. Kirsten Dunst is the love interest, and Megan Fox plays a dumb &#34;brunette&#34;. I figured with Jeff Bridges and Kirsten Dunst, it couldn't be that bad. Hang in there, and I think you will be glad you did. It eventually becomes one of those movies where you become connected to the characters and want to see how it all ends. I'm really glad I didn't turn it off! I watched the trailer to make sure I had the correct stars' names for this review, and in doing so, I realized there were a lot of really funny spots!

1222527,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001OFFRQ2,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 3]","While the story has been seen and done before, the formulaic structuring and over-predictability can more easily be forgiven thanks to an intriguing perspective and an enthusiastic performance from Simon Pegg. Though we may never know where he's going and how he'll turn up, his determined attitude fused with a daft sense of humor makes for an altogether pleasing progression.Based on the reckless real-life career of Toby Young, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People follows his tumultuous relationships with coworkers and the celebrities he despises. Sidney Young (Simon Pegg) is an arrogant, impudent, sarcastic, rude, and loathsome journalist itching to stir things up. When he's offered a job to write for a reputable, upscale magazine, his carefree attitude and opposite viewpoint on celebrity diplomacy begins to alienate and aggravate those around him. When he realizes his audacious methods are jeopardizing his chances at advancement, both in his career and with the coworker he's fallen for (Kirsten Dunst), he must decide whether or not to follow his heart or submit to the unforgiving conformity of the system.How to Lose Friends and Alienate People has a similar storyline and vibe to Mike Nichol's Working Girl - from a male perspective - but unfortunately much less charm. The realism of lead actor Simon Pegg's character is stilted due to the lack of an assumed disadvantage in a male dominated corporate environment - he instead chooses to be flamboyant and vexatious, which doesn't emit individuality so much as stupidity. While Pegg is a likeable actor and carries the sarcastic humor in the film with enthusiasm, his costars exude a wooden stodginess that may emphasize his fish-out-of-water status, but also dulls the garden-variety plot.Jeff Bridges plays a character that is comparable to Robert Loggia's MacMillan from ""Big."" Both recognize a nostalgic rebellious youth in their unlikely employees, but only MacMillan handles the situation as a father figure, mentor and professional. Bridges' Clayton Harding acknowledges the impudence of the unrestrained Sidney, but chooses to abandon his sense of reason - well beyond what we could imagine even an altruistic softy to be capable of.The story starts at the end, goes back to the beginning to explain the characters, and then arrives at the end once again. This formula seems to work for countless storylines, and so it continues to be utilized by dozens of contemporary films. The problem is that the method feels repetitive and doesn't help create singularity for a film that also has generic supporting characters and an all-too familiar plot. Repetition is the ultimate enemy, and How to Lose Friends and Alienate People can't quite launch itself into a presentation original enough to stand out. Truth may be stranger than fiction, but it's too bad it couldn't be more refreshing.- The Massie Twins",2,How to Lose Friends and Alienate People Review from The Massie Twins,1222905600,"10 2, 2008",2008,2883,"['story', 'been', 'seen', 'done', 'before', 'formulaic', 'structuring', 'over-predictability', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thanks', 'intriguing', 'perspective', 'enthusiastic', 'performance', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'where', 'going', 'how', ""'ll"", 'turn', 'up', 'determined', 'attitude', 'fused', 'daft', 'sense', 'humor', 'altogether', 'pleasing', 'progression.Based', 'reckless', 'real-life', 'career', 'Toby', 'Young', 'How', 'Lose', 'Friends', 'Alienate', 'People', 'tumultuous', 'relationships', 'coworkers', 'celebrities', 'Sidney', 'Young', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'arrogant', 'impudent', 'sarcastic', 'rude', 'loathsome', 'journalist', 'itching', 'stir', 'things', 'up', 'When', 'offered', 'job', 'write', 'reputable', 'upscale', 'magazine', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'opposite', 'viewpoint', 'celebrity', 'diplomacy', 'alienate', 'aggravate', 'When', 'audacious', 'methods', 'are', 'jeopardizing', 'chances', 'advancement', 'career', 'coworker', 'fallen', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'must', 'decide', 'not', 'follow', 'heart', 'submit', 'unforgiving', 'conformity', 'system.How', 'Lose', 'Friends', 'Alienate', 'People', 'similar', 'storyline', 'vibe', 'Mike', 'Nichol', 'Working', 'Girl', 'male', 'perspective', 'unfortunately', 'much', 'less', 'charm', 'realism', 'lead', 'actor', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'character', 'stilted', 'due', 'lack', 'assumed', 'disadvantage', 'male', 'dominated', 'corporate', 'environment', 'instead', 'be', 'flamboyant', 'vexatious', ""n't"", 'emit', 'individuality', 'so', 'much', 'stupidity', 'Pegg', 'likeable', 'actor', 'sarcastic', 'humor', 'film', 'enthusiasm', 'costars', 'exude', 'wooden', 'stodginess', 'may', 'emphasize', 'fish-out-of-water', 'status', 'also', 'garden-variety', 'plot.Jeff', 'Bridges', 'character', 'comparable', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'MacMillan', 'Big', 'recognize', 'nostalgic', 'rebellious', 'youth', 'unlikely', 'employees', 'only', 'MacMillan', 'situation', 'father', 'figure', 'mentor', 'professional', 'Bridges', 'Clayton', 'Harding', 'impudence', 'unrestrained', 'Sidney', 'abandon', 'sense', 'reason', 'well', 'what', 'could', 'imagine', 'even', 'altruistic', 'softy', 'be', 'capable', 'of.The', 'story', 'starts', 'end', 'back', 'beginning', 'explain', 'characters', 'then', 'end', 'once', 'again', 'formula', 'work', 'countless', 'storylines', 'so', 'be', 'utilized', 'dozens', 'contemporary', 'films', 'problem', 'method', 'feels', 'repetitive', ""n't"", 'help', 'create', 'singularity', 'film', 'also', 'generic', 'supporting', 'characters', 'all-too', 'familiar', 'plot', 'Repetition', 'ultimate', 'enemy', 'How', 'Lose', 'Friends', 'Alienate', 'People', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'launch', 'presentation', 'original', 'enough', 'stand', 'out', 'Truth', 'may', 'be', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'refreshing.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",N/A
