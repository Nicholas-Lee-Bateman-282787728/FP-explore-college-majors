799582,A1CNDQIH0RRHS1,B0001CCXZW,Adrienne B.,"[0, 0]","This is such a unique and fun show. I've owned this set for a few years now and I never get sick of it. There's always something new and fun to bring to the table. Yes, ultimately at the core of it all, its main idea is the relationships between characters, especially the Mom and Daughter relationship(s). (Lorelai + Rory, Emily + Lorelai, even Emily + Rory) However I feel it does a great job of showing character development without it getting too stale or boring.I really love that this show is so funny. It does a great job of making me actually laugh out loud and if you're anything like me, will try to challenge themselves to figure out where most of their little comedic ""references"" come from.Overall I adore the first season of Gilmore Girls. The writers do a great job of making Stars Hollow become a believable, little, small town community, even including the quirky personalities to be found in said towns. They keep you interested in it from the moment the pilot begins until the moment the final episode of the series ends.About the only complaint I have is the super-fast talking each character has to be able to speak at just so the writers can get everything in that they wanted to. Thought after a while its not hard to pick up on and you will barely notice it anymore. I guess it could actually add to part of the shows charm if you want to look at it that way.I enjoyed the special features on this dvd a lot. I feel it gives good insight into the story and characters. I especially loved finding out something interesting about the character of Luke. (Which I could tell you but wont because Im not going to ruin it for anyone.) And it gives good insights into how they were able to get the cast that they ultimately ended up with.Anyway, this is a very good show to watch. It's a great way to get one's mother/daughter to sit down for an hour and do something together. Actually, my entire family enjoys this show, not just the women. I guess there is enough humor in it to make it passable for guys to watch too.",5,So much fun,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",2009,2038,"['such', 'unique', 'fun', 'show', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'set', 'few', 'years', 'now', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'always', 'something', 'new', 'fun', 'bring', 'table', 'Yes', 'ultimately', 'core', 'main', 'idea', 'relationships', 'characters', 'especially', 'Mom', 'Daughter', 'relationship', 's', 'Lorelai', '+', 'Rory', 'Emily', '+', 'Lorelai', 'even', 'Emily', '+', 'Rory', 'However', 'feel', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'character', 'development', 'getting', 'too', 'stale', 'boring.I', 'really', 'love', 'show', 'so', 'funny', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'actually', 'out', 'loud', ""'re"", 'anything', 'will', 'try', 'challenge', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'most', 'little', 'comedic', 'references', 'come', 'from.Overall', 'adore', 'first', 'season', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'writers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'become', 'believable', 'little', 'small', 'town', 'community', 'even', 'including', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'be', 'found', 'said', 'towns', 'keep', 'interested', 'moment', 'pilot', 'moment', 'final', 'episode', 'series', 'only', 'complaint', 'have', 'super-fast', 'talking', 'character', 'be', 'able', 'speak', 'just', 'writers', 'can', 'get', 'everything', 'wanted', 'Thought', 'while', 'not', 'hard', 'pick', 'up', 'will', 'barely', 'notice', 'anymore', 'guess', 'could', 'actually', 'add', 'part', 'shows', 'charm', 'want', 'look', 'enjoyed', 'special', 'features', 'lot', 'feel', 'good', 'insight', 'story', 'characters', 'especially', 'loved', 'finding', 'out', 'something', 'interesting', 'character', 'Luke', 'Which', 'could', 'tell', 'wont', 'because', 'Im', 'not', 'going', 'ruin', 'anyone', 'good', 'insights', 'how', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'cast', 'ultimately', 'ended', 'up', 'with.Anyway', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'watch', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'one', 'mother/daughter', 'sit', 'down', 'hour', 'do', 'something', 'together', 'Actually', 'entire', 'family', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'women', 'guess', 'enough', 'humor', 'make', 'passable', 'guys', 'watch', 'too']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1

Lorelei and Rory Gilmore are mother and daughter and best friends and coffee lovers. when Rory gets into Chilton Lorelei has to turn to her wealthy parents to pay for the school whom she's worked hard to keep out of her life.  They agree to pay for Chilton but Lorelei and Rory must attend Friday night dinners in exchange for the money. Lorelei has a very strain relationship with her parents and you can actually see each charactor's point of view and understand where their coming from.  The entire cast is really amazing from Sookie, Luke and Michel to Paris, Richard and Emily. The town of Stars Hollow is a corky small town. Rory's smart, bookish and loves school which was a real change from most teenagers on TV. She has a goal to go to Harvard and her mother's determind to make that happen. Rory gets her first boyfriend in Dean while Lorelei dates one of Rory's teacher Max despite her attraction to diner owner Luke Danes. The writting is incredable from the hilarious jokes to the hundreds of references to movies, music and other stuff. I love how they don't dumb down the script with obvious references some of them are really obscure.

799586,A216EZY2WW3GZP,B0001CCXZW,"Annette Mackey ""Author""","[1, 2]","I had heard from various sources that GILMORE GIRLS was fun, sassy, and quick witted, so I thought, heck, I'll buy it for my teenage daughter. Little did I know that I would get sucked in right along with her. The characters are quirky and downright odd, making it one snappy, fun, sensational show.Here's a list of my favorite supporting characters. Sookie, the chef whose pastries and palatable perfection literally had my mouth watering, even as she went off on some tangent about Lorelai's whatever. There's the reception desk manager, Michel who is strangely bitter, yet so... not, that I could hardly take my eyes off of him. And that accent, ... oooo, la, la. Of course, the show would not be complete without Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's parents who are so perfect that they are full of flaws. Then there's Paris, one of my favorite characters of all time. She's a total psycho, but somehow, we all love her for the insanity and root her on as she claws her way to the top of the Harvard food chain. And then, da da da dum, we have Luke, the love object for Lorelai's affection and the father figure in Rory's eye.Of course, the main characters, Lorelai and Rory, are awesome. I particularly enjoyed watching the interaction between Lorelai and her parents. Rory acts like the padding in this relationship and rather than detract from the characters, this interaction works to propel the writing forward. There are no special effects, no cars exploding, no supernatural phenomenon, unless you count Lorelai's sensational appetite for all things quirky. Instead, there is quality acting, writing, and production, creating one superb show.That said, I didn't like season seven. I felt that I had invested all this time, effort and emotion into the show only to be let down and left hanging in season seven. There are just too many strange things that happen in season seven. It just about ruined the show for me.

It has to be the best pilot I have ever seen.  I know that Emily and Richard are snotty, but I do not think that there would be any Gilmore Girls without Friday night dinners.The show wouldn't be the same with different actors, its perfect!I just have one question about it, I mean I know who Kirk is, but in the 2nd episode (The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton), when Lorelai comes home to find him installing a DSL, well he says his name is Mick, so that can be confusing to some people.Dean has to be the most perfect boyfriend ever, I want my boyfriend to be like that, it wouldn't hurt to look like that either.  Also, I know that Triston likes Rory and she has no clue, but they could've went further on that, I think it would have been great if they would have done more than kiss, I mean like date or something, not sex!I am officially addicted to this show, and I cant wait until the 6th season comes off TV and on to DVD, I hate waiting a whole week to watch it.  I mean now that I have the DVDs seasons 1-5 I need to watch it everyday, can't go through a day without a Gilmore moment lol.Anyways, in the 1st season, Lorelai borrows money from her snotty parents and has to now come to dinner every Friday night. She meets Max, it doesn't work.  You can tell Luke and Lorelai like eachother! Rory gets her 1st boyfriend Dean, who is perfect. Rory gets accepted to Chilton, a prep school, one step closer to Harvard. Max and Lorelai get back together, with a unanswered purposal and 1000 yellow daises at the end.

In fact, the show is the first script supported by the Family Friendly Forum's script development fund to go on and become a regular television series. Part of an initiative between The WB Network - maker of such hits as Dawson's Creek (1998), Felicity (1998), Angel (1999), and Smallville (2001) - and fellow industry executives, this push for more family-oriented programming resulted in a series showcasing a unique mother-daughter bond and the various people they encounter on their life voyage of discovery. Set in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, Gilmore Girls utilizes many of the same sets as the hit series The Dukes Of Hazzard (1979) - another successful Warner Brothers production from years past...Gilmore Girls is set in a small idyllic community in Connecticut filled with a wide range of diverse characters and eccentric personalities. Against this backdrop, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) attempts to raise her daughter and best friend, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), to carve out a better life for herself. Having made a number of youthful mistakes, Lorelai made the decision to raise her daughter by herself at a young age (the same age as Rory when the series begins), and she's bound and determined to make sure that Rory makes better decisions for herself. As Rory prepares to go off to college, she displays many of the same likes and dislikes as her mother - especially when it comes to the opposite sex, and that's what worries Lorelai the most... A borderline soap opera, Gilmore Girls is more of a serial drama that focuses on the love, friendship, and shared growth of a mother and daughter as they live out their dreams in modern day America...The Gilmore Girls (Season 1) DVD features a number of touching episodes including the series premiere in which Rory is accepted to a very prestigious prep school named Chilton. But Lorelai struggles to come up with the tuition money necessary to send her, so she contacts her estranged parents for a loan. They agree to provide Rory with the tuition if Lorelai will agree to have a family dinner with them every Friday. Meanwhile, Rory has developed a crush on a recent transfer student, making her apprehensive about attending Chilton. When Lorelai finds out that a boy is the source of Rory's uncertainty, the two get in a fight with Lorelai fearing that Rory will follow in her own path of bad decisions. However, after the family dinner with Lorelai's parents, Rory realizes the sacrifice her mother has made in asking for the loan, and the two make up... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Forgiveness and Stuff"" in which a feuding Rory and Lorelai settle their differences just in time for Christmas, and ""The Third Lorelai"" in which Emily opposes her mother-in-law's offer to set up a trust fund for Rory because she's afraid it will mean an end to her contact with her granddaughter...Below is a list of episodes included on the Gilmore Girls (Season 1) DVD:Episode 1 (Pilot)Episode 2 (The Lorelais' First Day at Chilton)Episode 3 (Kill Me Now)Episode 4 (The Deer Hunters)Episode 5 (Cinnamon's Wake)Episode 6 (Rory's Birthday Parties)Episode 7 (Kiss and Tell)Episode 8 (Love and War and Snow)Episode 9 (Rory's Dance)Episode 10 (Forgiveness and Stuff)Episode 11 (Paris is Burning)Episode 12 (Double Date)Episode 13 (Concert Interruptus)Episode 14 (That Damn Donna Reed)Episode 15 (Christopher Returns)Episode 16 (Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers)Episode 17 (The Breakup, Part 2)Episode 18 (The Third Lorelai)Episode 19 (Emily in Wonderland)Episode 20 (P.S.

Commentaries over a few of the episodes would have been nice, as would a few more outtakes, but the set is generally worth the money.As for content, I can echo that it is witty, well-written and equally well-acted by regulars and guest stars alike. A fine production. I would like to point out, however, for those thinking this is a family forum drama, that Lorelai Gilmore stands for everything but family. She made it clear from the beginning that she wants very little to do with her own parents, whom she openly despises, and never wanted to start a family of her own with Rory's father, whom she never married. She can be applauded for opting out of abortion and for raising Rory 'a-la-Murphy Brown' into the young woman we find here in season one. However, Lorelai sets no good example for her blossoming young daughter by hopping into bed with Rory's teacher, ending that relationship abruptly when Rory finds out and flips out, then sleeping with Rory's dad when he happens to pop into town for a quick visit after many years away. At season one's end Lorelai is back in the teachers' sack, hiding the renewed relationship from her daughter. (The lie of omission is still deception.) Rory finds out and flips out again, which only compounds her angst as she tries to determine what LOVE is and if she has it for Dean, who broke up with her after he confessed his love and she did not verbally reciprocate.Having just seen the opening episode for the latest season, I can tell you that season one is the most innocent; it goes quickly down hill from there. Rory is now not only hopping from one bed to another and back again - like her mother - but she is now a full-blown, 'my needs are all that matter' adulteress. Rory's friend Lane, a once sweet but now jaded anti-Christian, when finding out about Rory's latest sex-capade with the now married Dean at Miss Patty's studio, remarks &#34;Miss Patty would be proud!&#34; This current moral attitude is far removed from season one's &#34;Rory's Dance&#34; episode where Dean and Rory innocently fell asleep at Miss Patty's, causing jaws to drop all over Stars Hollow.If you enjoyed the quirky characters of Stars Hollow when they first appeared on our little screens, you should find these 22 episodes well worth watching again.

I thought it would be some boring soap opera, and I really didn't care for the premise.  But, this show is so good and entertaining that, I can't stop watching it.The funny thing is, I can't figure out what I love about it, and why it's better than other shows I like a lot such as Dawson's Creek, and 7th Heaven.  The chemistry is probably the part that gets me the most, especially between our central characters:  Lorelai and Rory, Lorelai and Emily, Sookie and Lorelai, Sookie and Jackson, Luke and Lorelai, Rory and Paris, Rory and Lane.  It's well scripted and the acting is top notch.Besides all that, what else is there?  The story arc is fantastic, as bland as it could have been.  Lorelai is a 32 year old mother of a teenage daughter, Rory, who's almost 16.  Lorelai has raised her daughter on her own in a small town called Stars Hollow, in Connecticut, along with some help with many great friends along the way (Luke, Bebe + Maury, Miss Patty, Sookie St. James, and Rory's best friend Lane, and soon to enter would be Paris, and Dean.).  The best part is that nobody really has a background role.  All the roles are pretty important to each character in some way, and it's all connected.  A lot of real life situations are met along the way:  Rory starts a new school, Rory's first kiss, Lorelai and Rory's english teacher date, Rory's school dance and not being home by curfew, pressures by an overbearing mother and father, class differences, jealousy, birth out of wedlock, etc.  All are taken seriously, but are not over done, nor are they melodramatic as they are in shows such as Dawson's Creek, or even Full House.I think what I love most is how much I see in Rory and Lorelai's great relationship.  I see a lot of me in both of them (even though I am male).  And their mother-daughter relationship is very familiar to me.  It's nice to see that kind of thing on TV, something that not all families get to share.  That awesome closeness, coupled with the dark juxtaposition between Lorelai, and her mom.This show really is for everyone, and I really encourage everyone to check this show out.

799602,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0001CCXZW,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","While flipping through channels a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon Gilmore Girls. I recall when the series was first aired in 2000 and for some reason I never got around to watching an episode. What caught my eye was that Lauren Graham was constantly carrying around a cup of coffee, which so do I. After twenty minutes of viewing and listening to the snappy dialogue, I was now a fan. A few days later I went to a Target store in the city and found seasons one and two bundled together for twenty dollars.Gilmore Girls is set in the small, wacky town of Stars Hollows, where single mother Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham), manager of the Independence Inn, is raising her sixteen-year-old daughter Rory (played Alexis Bledel). When her daughter is accepted into the Chilton Preparatory School, Lorelai asks her rich estranged parents for financial help due to the school's expensive tuition. Of course things are not so simple as her parents want them to have Friday night dinners with them and be an active involvement in their lives.Besides from Lorelai and Rory's addiction to coffee, I like their quirky personalities.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[127, 129]","""The Show That Almost Wasn't.""That's the most surprising lesson learned about the nature of television production -- as told by the show's creator Amy Sherman-Palladino -- in the WB's stellar GILMORE GIRLS release: Ms. S-P had pitched a variety of programs for WB executives, and, when they asked for more, she made up an idea on the spot -- with no preparation or background detail -- which the executives took!  Then, Ms. S-P had to go and create it.GILMORE GIRLS arguably stands as a benchmark in television history.  In some ways, the program is like SEINFELD: if you don't get it, you won't get it.  In other ways, it's a high quality Hallmark Channel movie-of-the-week, currently stretching out beyond its fourth season and soon to be entering its fifth.  Still, in more ways, there's absolutely nothing else like it on television.GG is far more than just the story of Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, Lorelai ""Rory"" Gilmore: it's the story of the fictional town known as Star's Hollow -- the dreamland for bed-n-breakfast businesses -- and the odd assortment of characters who happen to live, work, and breathe there.  While the centerpiece is clearly the Gilmore family -- a contemporization of the BRADY BUNCH, if there could ever be such a thing -- the spin of the show is, to its benefit, the plethora of wonderfully imagined and uniquely quirky townsfolk who populate the secondary storylines.And, yes, the acting is top notch.  The direction is absolutely superb.  The writing is, by far, some of the most deserving work being put up on the boob tube today.Still, GG is on the WB, meaning that it will, more than likely, never find the kind of ratings the show deserves.  Like STAR TREK, GILMORE will find its true financial potential in syndication and DVD releases ... much like this current release of the 21 1st season episodes.To my delight, I'm just discovered these television characters.  My wife has watched the show since the beginning, but I always dismissed it as a ""chick flick,"" tuning it out to spend my time on other shows.  However, she convinced me to give it a chance this past season (its fourth), and now -- here am I -- writing a review for Season 1 that we watched together virtually non-stop.  Others here have raved about the quality of the writing -- the true lifeblood of the program -- and I wouldn't even attempt to do GILMORE a disservice in discussing it other than to add ""every good thing that's been said here is absolutely not enough to sanctify how well, apparently, every episode is written.""Honestly, GILMORE is really that good.Truth be told, the extras are surprisingly thin -- but of good quality -- on this 1st season release, especially considering the fact that the show is currently in production for the WB.  Disc 6 includes a handful of deleted scenes; a mini-doc with some revealing insights from the show's creator, cast, and crew; and some scenes from various episodes edited together in a piece that tries to capture the 'essence' of what makes GILMORE GIRLS as remarkable a television achievement as it is.  One would think that Warner Brothers would've offered more -- in-depth interviews with the series cast OR, minimally, an audio commentary or two -- but, sadly, that isn't the case.  As a result, one could argue that the studio -- as Amy Sherman-Palladino points out in the scant 30 minute documentary -- has underestimated the intelligence of its audience, focusing only on the commercialism of the program and not feeding the fanbase brain.The 6-disc set is presented in full screen format.  The video quality is excellent.  The sound quality is excellent (there are a handful of scenes that are hard to hear b/c of verbal pacing, not production issues).  Overall, this is one great package only lessened by what they chose not to provide: audio commentaries.",5,Get More Gilmore!,1087776000,"06 21, 2004",2004,3834,"['Show', 'Almost', 'Was', ""n't"", 'most', 'surprising', 'lesson', 'learned', 'nature', 'television', 'production', 'told', 'show', 'creator', 'Amy', 'Sherman-Palladino', 'WB', 'stellar', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'release', 'Ms.', 'S-P', 'had', 'pitched', 'variety', 'programs', 'WB', 'executives', 'when', 'asked', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'idea', 'spot', 'preparation', 'background', 'detail', 'executives', 'took', 'Then', 'Ms.', 'S-P', 'had', 'go', 'create', 'it.GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'arguably', 'benchmark', 'television', 'history', 'ways', 'program', 'like', 'SEINFELD', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'ways', 'high', 'quality', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'movie-of-the-week', 'currently', 'stretching', 'out', 'fourth', 'season', 'soon', 'be', 'entering', 'fifth', 'Still', 'more', 'ways', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'else', 'television.GG', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'story', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'daughter', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', 'story', 'fictional', 'town', 'known', 'Star', 'Hollow', 'dreamland', 'bed-n-breakfast', 'businesses', 'odd', 'assortment', 'characters', 'who', 'happen', 'live', 'work', 'breathe', 'there', 'centerpiece', 'clearly', 'Gilmore', 'family', 'contemporization', 'BRADY', 'BUNCH', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'such', 'thing', 'spin', 'show', 'benefit', 'plethora', 'wonderfully', 'imagined', 'uniquely', 'quirky', 'townsfolk', 'who', 'populate', 'secondary', 'storylines.And', 'yes', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'direction', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'writing', 'far', 'most', 'deserving', 'work', 'being', 'put', 'up', 'boob', 'tube', 'today.Still', 'GG', 'WB', 'meaning', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'never', 'find', 'kind', 'ratings', 'show', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'GILMORE', 'will', 'find', 'true', 'financial', 'potential', 'syndication', 'DVD', 'releases', 'much', 'current', 'release', '21', '1st', 'season', 'episodes.To', 'delight', ""'m"", 'just', 'discovered', 'television', 'characters', 'wife', 'watched', 'show', 'beginning', 'always', 'dismissed', 'chick', 'flick', 'tuning', 'spend', 'time', 'other', 'shows', 'However', 'convinced', 'give', 'chance', 'past', 'season', 'fourth', 'now', 'here', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'Season', '1', 'watched', 'together', 'virtually', 'non-stop', 'Others', 'here', 'have', 'raved', 'quality', 'writing', 'true', 'lifeblood', 'program', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'do', 'GILMORE', 'disservice', 'discussing', 'other', 'add', 'good', 'thing', 'been', 'said', 'here', 'absolutely', 'not', 'enough', 'sanctify', 'how', 'well', 'apparently', 'episode', 'written', 'Honestly', 'GILMORE', 'really', 'good.Truth', 'be', 'told', 'extras', 'are', 'surprisingly', 'thin', 'good', 'quality', '1st', 'season', 'release', 'especially', 'considering', 'fact', 'show', 'currently', 'production', 'WB', 'Disc', '6', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'mini-doc', 'revealing', 'insights', 'show', 'creator', 'cast', 'crew', 'scenes', 'various', 'episodes', 'edited', 'together', 'piece', 'capture', ""'essence"", 'what', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'remarkable', 'television', 'achievement', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'would', ""'ve"", 'offered', 'more', 'in-depth', 'interviews', 'series', 'cast', 'OR', 'minimally', 'audio', 'commentary', 'two', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'case', 'result', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'studio', 'Amy', 'Sherman-Palladino', 'points', 'out', 'scant', '30', 'minute', 'documentary', 'underestimated', 'intelligence', 'audience', 'focusing', 'only', 'commercialism', 'program', 'not', 'feeding', 'fanbase', 'brain.The', '6-disc', 'set', 'presented', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'video', 'quality', 'excellent', 'sound', 'quality', 'excellent', 'are', 'handful', 'scenes', 'are', 'hard', 'hear', 'b/c', 'verbal', 'pacing', 'not', 'production', 'issues', 'Overall', 'one', 'great', 'package', 'only', 'lessened', 'what', 'chose', 'not', 'provide', 'audio', 'commentaries']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1

Still, my girlfriend got the first series on DVD and we'd been watching it in mini-mararathons now and then, and it's a pretty decent show.The series is all about Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a mother and daughter who live in a small, sleepy American town, where everyone knows everyone, as well as everyone's business. Rory was the result of a fling Lorelai had with a boy when she was 16, a fling that has alienated her from her well-to-do parents, who live half an hour away. Rory thinks they're nice enough, but Lorelai tries to keep out of their way. This year, however, she won't be able to do that. You see, this year, young Rory is off to a very exclusive school, to make the most of her academic talents. This all costs money, and Lorelai is forced to ask her distanced parents for a loan. Her parents agree, on the condition that Lorelai and Rory come to see them once a week for dinner. Being the first series, there are many others firsts. First kisses, first loves, etc. I'm sure all these firsts will leave others out there wanting seconds!It's strange, but it doesn't feel like a TV series, I don't think. Like I've mentioned, I watched these episodes in bursts, and it all flowed like a really long movie (in a good way). Characters interacted, grew and developed, the people's feelings turned into ideas, and those ideas into actions across the episodes. It was quite interesting, very, very well planned and put together. The characters aren't perfect (I find Lorelai to be a bit of a control freak, for instance), but I think the writers know that, and these faults are explored nicely.There's quite a lot of cultural references in the show. Rory being as intellegent as she is, she reads a lot of classic literature, and her friend Lane Kim seems to have an encyclopedia-like knowledge of popular music. It was nice to hear these references, and I knew what most of them were, but at the age these teens are supposed to be, I found a little unbelievable. It was a bit of a stretch that they knew so much, but ah well.Worth a look for fans of drama-comedies.

In one episode, however, the liberal bent lurking in the background comes to the fore in a nasty way - for no reason, the mom screams that she hates George Bush. And why? Because of the way he looks!

They share a love for breathless quip-filled conversation and coffee, frequenting Luke's Diner in the downtown of Stars Hollow, their fictitious Connecticut suburb.In Season 1, Rory decides she wants to transfer from the public high school to Chilton, a ritzy private school in Hartford. To make it happen, Lorelai has to make the ultimate sacrifice -- beseech her parents Richard and Emily, with whom she hasn't been on good terms since she announced her teenage pregnancy. Although estranged with Lorelai, the elder Gilmores are more than eager to accept their young granddaughter into their lives. They agree to foot the bill -- on one condition. Both Lorelai and Rory must attend dinner at the elder Gilmores' home every Friday evening.Reluctantly, Lorelai agrees. The resulting Friday night dinners set the stage for much hilarity and snark -- as well as the occasional glimpse into the Gilmores' sad past, hinting at everything that went wrong in their relationship, well before Rory's birth.Also seen on the show are diner proprietor Luke, a quiet, loyal friend to both mother and daughter with a building crush on Lorelai; Lane, the Korean-American daughter of a stern single mother and Rory's best friend; Kirk, a quirky ""townie"" who mysteriously shows up everywhere anyone's doing anything; dance instructor and romance expert Miss Patty; and many others.Although the show is supposedly set in Connecticut, the writers and producers never really make that believable to a native (i.e. Rory and Lorelai walking around with thin coats, wide open, supposedly in the middle of winter.

799631,A3R633H9EJ6VVP,B0001CCXZW,K. Bowers,"[2, 2]","First and foremost, I must begin by saying that Gilmore Girls is the best television show I have seen in years. I must start with the cast. Lauren Graham couldn't be better for the role of the mother, Loralei Gilmore. And Rory wouldn't be Rory without Alexis Bledel's angelic appearance and amazing acting skills.Gilmore Girls is a story of a young mother and daughter who, surprisingly, are best friends. Rory is 16 and Loralei is 32 (Loralei dropped out of highschool at 16 when she became pregnant with Christopher's baby). At the beginning of the season, Loralei wants Rory to go Chilton, a Connecticut prep school. But the only way in is to pay the costly tuition, and the only way to get the money is to ask dear mom and dad for the loan, which means in return, you will have to meet with them for dinner every Friday evening. And that, my friend, is the last thing Loralei wants to do after sixteen years of freedom from her pushy, proper, rich, and conniving parents, Richard and Emily Gilmore. But Rory must go to Chilton. So Loralei must go to dinner. Over the season, you are introduced to more and more characters. Luke Danes, the diner guy who never takes his hat off and hardly ever says a word. But Luke would do anything for Loralei because he has a crush on her. Then there is Dean, Rory's first boyfriend. Ahh, first love. Dean thinks nothing but of Rory and would do anything for her. Next is Lane Kim, Rory's best friend. Lane is Korean and her mother is very religious and strict. Which means, but of course, a lot of sneaking around. Then, there's Sookie St. James, best friend and coworker of Loralei. Sookie is bubbly, funny, and the world's best chef. Then comes Jackson, Sookie's future husband, but for now, the vegetable guy who has a major crush on Sookie. And Sookie, poor thing, is clueless. Michelle is Loralei's french coworker at the Independence Inn. And most of the time, she would love to slap him. Miss Patty is the town gossiper, an old beauty who still instructs dance lessons and is a little over the top. But every town has one of those. Next up is Taylor, town mayor, owner of everything, and Luke's arch enemy. Then there's Kirk, the town geek who has a lot of strange ideas. Moving on to Rory's classmates, Paris Geller, the perfectionist who needs a therapist and would like nothing better than to take smart and pretty Rory down. Madelyn and Louise are her possy that think nothing but of fashion and have brains the size of peanuts. Then there's Tristan, the preppy, stuck up, school hottie who is dying for Rory, but Rory hates him. Oh the drama. But the best thing about Gilmore Girls is how all these characters come together with their wacky personalities and create a bond. Stars Hollow is really the perfect, ideal small town filled with busy bodys. But that's to be expected. Loralei and Rory have an unexplainable bond and work perfectly together. Loralei's witty sense of humor ties it all together. With a brilliant cast, a brilliant writer, and a brilliant director, Gilmore Girls is everything you could hope for in a TV show. It's warm, funny, and sweet. It's one of a kind. And I hope this review has persuaded you to buy this season, because you're really missing out on something if you don't.

799636,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001CCXZW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 10]","I am sure every one has their own reference point for viewing ""Gilmore Girls,"" especially if they really like the show.  Since I am neither a mother nor a daughter my frame of reference is not in the real world but in the ghost of a television show past, namely ""Moonlighting.""  This might strike some of your as odd, but on ""Gilmore Girls"" the average script for an episode is usually 75-80 pages versus the 45-50 for a normal hour-long television program, which was pretty much the math I remember from Glenn Gordon Caron's hit series (1985-89) which reminded America who Cybil Shepherd was and introduced the world to Bruce Willis.  The nice thing about ""Gilmore Girls"" is that unlike Dave and Maddie we do not need to fear that Lorelai and Rory will do the same thing to mess up their chemistry (they will have to find some other way).Set in the storybook Connecticut town of Stars Hollow, which is populated by an eccentric mix of folks, the Gilmore girls are 32-year-old Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and 16-year-old Rory (Alexis Bledel).  When Lorelai was Rory's age she became an unwed mother, to the disappointment of her parents (Kelly Bishop and Edward Herrmann), not to mention generations of Gilmore ancestors probably going back to the ""Mayflower."" But Lorelai has carved out her own life, managing an inn, and having a relationship with Rory which is more like best friends than mother and daughter.  The only problem is that Rory has her heart set on going to Harvard and being able to attend Chilton, a private school in Hartford, would be a big help.  That means Lorelai has to ask her parents for help and the price is steep: every Friday Lorelai and Rory have to go to dinner at the Gilmore mansion.  Good thing Lorelai really loves her daughter a whole bunch.I can explain why I like ""Gilmore Girls"" simply by pointing out that on Disc 6 of ""The Complete First Season"" where we have the episode ""Rory's Dance"" enhanced by pop ups explaining all the pop culture, historical, and other references, I did not need any of them.  In fact, I caught a couple of lines where I thought they could have added some pop ups.  I am a bit weak on current musical groups, but fortunately Rory has eclectic tastes in such regards, so there are still more hits than misses.  Absolutely true that people do not talk like this in the real world, but they should, even if that means you have to put up with a lot of eye rolling and sighs being heaved your way.The supporting cast is wonderful.  Melissa McCarthy as Sookie St. James may well be the Willow of the thirtysomething generation and if Lorelai and Luke (Scott Patterson) are the last too people in town to know they are meant for each other they will have to catch on eventually, 1000 yellow daisies not withstanding.  Keiko Agena as Lane Kim and Liza Weil as Paris Geller provide the polar opposites of Rory's divided teenage existence for the female gender with Jared Padalecki as Dean Forester and Chad Michael Murray as Tristan DuGrey doing the duty for the other side.But the heart of this series is indeed the Gilmore girls, all three of them.  Graham is like a standup comedienne who does not mind if no one gets her cracks because she knows how good they are even if others are waiting for the pop ups.  Bledel, whose only previous credit was as an extra in ""Rushmore,"" is simply someone that the camera loves and who has a way of speaking that is even more endearing.  Then there is Bishop as Lorelai's mother, a picture of being prim and proper but desperate to maintain contact with her daughter, even though she is loathe admitting it.  Lorelai and her mother have a reputation that has been deeply damaged, perhaps irrevocably; but that is why we have to stay tune.  Meanwhile Rory is building a relationship with her grandparents at those Friday night dinners separate from the existing hostility.The series is unique it that it is the first series to make it to the air supported by the Family Friendly Forum's Script Development Fund, an initiative between some of the nation's top advertisers and the WB network.  The show was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, who previously worked on the situation comedies ""Roseanne"" and ""Veronica's Closet.""  I was told my several people that I should watch ""Gilmore Girls"" when it started on the WB in the 2000-2001 series, but it aired on Thursday nights opposite other shows I was already watching and as mentioned above my sense of gender identification with the lead characters is rather limited.  Fortunately shows like ""Gilmore Girls,"" ""Roswell,"" and other series I should have been watching but missed are available on DVD.  The problem is that the show just finished its fourth season and how am I supposed to catch up so I can get on track?",5,"Yes, I actually do wish this was how everybody always talked",1085356800,"05

799640,A1JDT2VPCZVQW9,B0001CCXZW,"Marie Anne A. ""Mary""","[0, 0]","My husband converted me to Gilmore Girls fandom through reruns on ABC Family channel. We rented the complete first season so that I might enjoy the series from the beginning.The first season lays the groundwork for the future complexities and issues in the series. From the first episode, we learn about Lorelai's stormy relationship with her parents; Rory's ambitions; Sookie's gourmet tastes (which ultimately lead her to love and babies); the Gilmores disappointments, etc. The major characters are not perfect. Lorelai is still ""stuck"" at 16- the age she was when she gave birth to Rory. Rory's best friend is her immature mother. (In fact, I've become upset with Rory for occassionally closing out Lane Kim, who is her other best friend.) Lorelai and Rory are selfish, confused, and emotionally unavailable to their friends. Still, it's addictive to watch their trials and tribulations in their quiet New England town.Lane, Sookie, and Michael are wonderful supporting characters who are much healthier than our heroines. Lane is the best friend every teenager wishes she would have. Lane's mom is the kind of parents most mothers wish their daughters' best friends would have! Sookie is has so much gusto and she's not afraid to ask men out. Michael has to deal with Lorelai's juvenile nonsense, and he takes it all with good humor and sassy replies! :)The show attempts to deal with issues of socioeconomic status. That's where it fails, in retrospect. The canned stereotypes leave much to be desired. Not only do the superwealthy (Gilmores) become embarrassed when their 16 year old daughter gets pregnant; not only do the superwealthy become disappointed when their teen daughter ruins her college plans; not only do the superwealthy wreck their cars in drunken stupors; not only do the superwealthy get all persnickety about their homes and appearances.

799641,A3OOY6Y4LBUEKP,B0001CCXZW,Mechelle,"[2, 2]","Oh, Gilmore! *sigh* You were so young!Let's start this off with a statement: I am a GIGANTIC Gilmore fan. GIGANTIC! I've watched this show since I was 15 years old, so I feel as if I've grown up with it and its characters.This is the very first season. Rory is an innocent, inexperienced little one (yes, I'm getting sentimental even though Rory is a year or two older than I am). Lorelai is still working at the Independence Inn and, of course, looking for a man (which she does basically throughout the series. Luke forever! Okay. I'll stop, ha), dealing with her parents, and caring for the love of her life: Her daughter, Rory, whom she had at the age of 16, which created a myriad of problems between her and her parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore.The first season of the show revolves around Rory and Lorelai's relationship, their loves lives, and their outside school/working lives. Rory enrolls into Chilton, an esteemed prep school, and she meets a group of girls including the sarcastic Paris Gellar. Lorelai is working at her Inn with her best friend, Chef Sookie, and rude but funny as hell Michel. The show is also infused with the goings on of Stars Hollow (where Lorelai and Rory live), which happens to be a town I would die to live in with people I would die to call my friends. The townies are hilarious. Luke, who owns the local diner, is just beyond words awesome. And if you don't end up wanting Luke and Lorelai together by the first season...you are basically not good. Haha. Just playing. The show also has the Gilmore (aka: the rich world Lorelai left at 16) world alongside the Stars Hollow world. It is filled with Friday Night Dinners, fancy parties hosted by Emily, and enough guilt and resentment to make anyone become a coffee addict like Lorelai Gilmore.The writing is so great thanks to Amy Sherman-Palladino, Daniel Palladino, and other writers. The show has such heart, charm, and wit. The characters are the best I've ever seen on any television show. The performances are all great - especially Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore) and Kelly Bishop's (Emily Gilmore). Scott Patterson (Luke Danes) is also great throughout the series, but never receives the credit he should. But do remember, I'm a GIGANTIC fan, so I could be bias.Basically...watch the damn show.

The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel is uncanny and overwhelmingly convincing and endlessly entertaining.  The show does a great job of slipping in ""side stories"" for additional interest while keeping the focus primarily on the endeavors of Lorelai and Rory.  Essentially, all of the show's acting is excellent, including Scott Patterson's masterful portrayal of the Luke character, but it's Alexis Bledel who 'steals the show' again and again--granted, she's at an advantage in the sense that she's playing such a likeable character in the first place, however, she truly brings the Rory character to life in such a one-of-a-kind way that's pure genius.  Obviously a lot has already been said about ""Gilmore Girls"" and certainly no one in the right mind can deny it's a terrific show.  I'd just like to add that there's a wonderfully uplifting and human quality about ""Gilmore Girls""--to put it a certain way, it makes you realize that certain things that can happen in life are really not as catastrophic as they may appear.  ""Gilmore Girls"" serves as a reminder of the joyfulness that life can provide, as well as the importance of really learning from life's experiences.  Plus, there is some GREAT and intelligent humor in here that totally hits the spot, plus fun references to history, music, and more.  This 6 DVD set is excellently packaged and contains generous bonus material--add to this the consistent high quality of the show itself, this set easily justifies its price.

The casting on this show is also trememendous with a few exceptions.  Suki (please excuse my spelling of characters names) sucks.  She's an obnoxious stupid cook who is so darn annoying!  Lane is interesting, but barely in the show enough to matter, and all of Rory's Chilton friends are shallow and 2-dimensional largely because the actors playing them are no good.  The Gilmores themselves, including Grandma and Grandpa are amazingly fun to watch though.  The lead roles (including Luke) are hilarious and enjoyable in basically every episode.

A story about a mother and a daughter bravely going through life could have been pathetic, boring and uninteresting. But then the makers took an unexpected U-Turn - they made it a smart one.The most valuable part of this mother-daughter story is the dialogue. When Lorelai and Rory get in their zone, the audience is thrown inside a chaos of pop culture references, witty word-choices and genuine emotion. Most importantly, the audience is invited to be a part of Stars Hollow, the little city where the two Lorelais live with a bunch of other memorable characters. In order to understand the show, you need to actively participate in the discussions and issues of the show. What is usually something you watch while ironing the clothes, you are absorbed into the world of Gilmore Girls.This show is successful because of its cast. There is some fine acting involved, and although the cast is basically unknown, they make you care and follow their struggles without blinking. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are adorable and manage to cover all the minor mistakes that are made. After you see the whole first season of this wonderful show, you will be left with a sufficient amount of special features to become a Stars Hollow native yourself.

799649,A10X0JN8KTK89H,B0001CCXZW,ninjasuperstar,"[1, 1]","The quick, witty dialogue of Gilmore Girls is an homage to screwball comedy films like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.  It works surprising well, largely because there are different levels of speed talking: Some characters can keep up, others get lost, and some try on certain days and prefer to be normal people on other days.  References and allusions abound as well.  Some of the cultural references are highly obscure - that is, even with your ability to pause and rewind the world of Gilmore Girls, there are times when even the viewer can't keep up.  This is all part of the fun of a dialogue-driven comedy that serves its main characters far too much coffee and a hilarious amount of food.When the plot turns serious and the dialogue slows down, the sparkling planned community shimmers away as the stuff of real life creates drama.  I appreciate that the writers understand the need to feel drama slowly.  You can't banter through it, because only happy people relish in clever games.It's hard to explain how a show about mostly white, middle class people living in a crime-free fantasy has become so popular, especially on the WB, which has been one of the few channels to embrace all of America's cultures, races, classes, and so on.  I think the answer is that the relationship between a single mother and her daughter and an absentee father is highly translatable to many Americans.  There are many conversations detailing Lorelai's struggles to provide for her daughter.  Viewers also empathize with the weird and uncomfortable encounters with rich, elitist people, namely, Lorelai's parents.The DVDs are somewhat lacking in extras - a making-of video and some extended or extra scenes are all you get.  I think fans of the show would enjoy a dialogue dictionary of all of the references the characters make, a list of the books Rory and Jess are always reading, a map of Stars Hollow, a coffee cup, and Sookie's recipes.",5,Think 1940s screwball comedy mixed with a planned community drama,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,1940,"['quick', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'homage', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'films', 'Girl', 'Friday', 'Bringing', 'Up', 'Baby', 'surprising', 'well', 'largely', 'are', 'different', 'levels', 'speed', 'talking', 'characters', 'can', 'keep', 'up', 'others', 'get', 'lost', 'try', 'certain', 'days', 'prefer', 'be', 'normal', 'people', 'other', 'days', 'References', 'allusions', 'abound', 'as', 'well', 'cultural', 'references', 'are', 'highly', 'obscure', 'even', 'ability', 'pause', 'rewind', 'world', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'even', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'part', 'fun', 'dialogue-driven', 'comedy', 'main', 'characters', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'coffee', 'hilarious', 'amount', 'food.When', 'plot', 'serious', 'dialogue', 'down', 'sparkling', 'planned', 'community', 'away', 'stuff', 'real', 'life', 'drama', 'appreciate', 'writers', 'understand', 'need', 'feel', 'drama', 'slowly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'banter', 'only', 'happy', 'people', 'relish', 'clever', 'games.It', 'hard', 'explain', 'how', 'show', 'mostly', 'white', 'middle', 'class', 'people', 'living', 'crime-free', 'fantasy', 'become', 'so', 'popular', 'especially', 'WB', 'been', 'one', 'few', 'channels', 'embrace', 'America', 'cultures', 'races', 'classes', 'so', 'think', 'answer', 'relationship', 'single', 'mother', 'daughter', 'absentee', 'father', 'highly', 'translatable', 'many', 'Americans', 'are', 'many', 'conversations', 'detailing', 'Lorelai', 'struggles', 'provide', 'daughter', 'Viewers', 'also', 'empathize', 'weird', 'uncomfortable', 'encounters', 'rich', 'elitist', 'people', 'namely', 'Lorelai', 'parents.The', 'DVDs', 'are', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'extras', 'making-of', 'video', 'extended', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'get', 'think', 'fans', 'show', 'would', 'enjoy', 'dialogue', 'dictionary', 'references', 'characters', 'make', 'list', 'books', 'Rory', 'Jess', 'are', 'always', 'reading', 'map', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'coffee', 'cup', 'Sookie', 'recipes']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1
799650,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B0001CCXZW,P Magnum,"[4, 6]","Gilmore Girls is one the best-written, well acted shows on television.  The program bounces along at a breakneck pace, filled witty dialogue and banter between characters that are reminiscent of Hollywood films of the 30's and 40's.  The show focuses on the mother-daughter relationship between Lorelei (Lauren Graham) &amp; Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) who are really best friends. Lorelei comes from a wealthy Hartford family and got pregnant at sixteen and moved to a small Connecticut hamlet called Stars Hollow to raise Rory. Lorelei runs the local Independence Inn and Rory is an incredibly gifted high school student.  The show's plots are built around the girl's relationship which each other and the conflicting lives Lorelei leads.  One is her life in Stars Hollow, which is filled with quirky residents and odd town events.  The other is with her estranged parents (Kelly Bishop &amp; Edward Hermann), whose blue-blooded ways rankle with her free spirit.  Lorelei is forced to take her parents help in order to pay for Rory's tuition at the prestigious Chilton School which will help Rory try to fulfill her dream of going to Harvard.  As a condition of giving her the money, Lorelei and Rory must attend weekly Friday dinners at their house.  These dinners lead to numerous confrontations between Lorelei and her parents throughout the season.  The residents of Stars Hollow provide comfort and friendship to the Gilmores.  Among them are the gruff and grumpy Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) who owns the local diner, Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) who is Lorelei's best friend and chef at the inn and Michel Gerard (Yanic Truesdale) who is desk manager at the inn and is incredibly sarcastic.  Ms. Graham is a revelation in her role.  She commands every scene she is in and she can deftly deliver the rapid-fire dialogue that is in every show.  She is one of the most over-looked and underrated actresses on television.  The extras on the disk are as good as any on tv show box set.

If you're thinking of giving the show a chance because you've heard so much about it, go ahead! Jump, take the dive, it's perfectly safe.Season 1 is the story of the Gilmore family, Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter, and all the people they include daily in their lives. Wether by blood or by experience, the Gilmore family is a big and fun one.Season 1 deals with how Lorelai and Rory got to that point in their lives. It deals with Rory growing up, having her first boyfriend; with Lorelai slowly coming to terms with her parents and her expectations for her daughter and their world.The Gilmore girls are not perfect, but they're charming and quite interesting. One of the highlights of the season is Rory's developing relationship with Dean Forester. I think Dean is usually underrated, but to me, he was Rory's best boyfriend and in this season, while they're still so young, they're still a romantic and warm couple.There are little DVD extras and the ones included are not exactly riveting or revealing.

799654,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0001CCXZW,Robert Moore,"[3, 3]","There are only three shows that I know where the act of conversation is elevated to the status of high art:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, THE WEST WING (early seasons only), and THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Though these three shows may not have a great deal in common in other ways, all three revel in great talk.  Other shows have good talk, but these three have great, great talk.  Take just a sample, delivered at a machine gun pace:GRANDMA: You were on the phone.GRANDPA: Long distance.LORELAI: God?GRANDPA: London.LORELAI: God lives in London?GRANDPA: My mother lives in London.LORELAI: Your mother is God?GRANDPA: Lorelai.LORELAI: So, God IS a woman...GRANDPA: Lorelai.LORELAI: And a relative, that's so cool. I'm gonna totally ask for favors.Series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, the self-proclaimed model for Lorelai Gilmore and the writer of an unreasonably large number of the brilliant screenplays, has an absolute genius for talk.  Few movies and no television series (apart from the above mentioned BUFFY and WEST WING-early-seasons-only) contain better talk.  I watch the episodes of this series with a persistent grin and an unceasing delight in the manner in which the show elevates mere talk to something greater than mere talk.  It is in many other ways a very good show, but what makes it exceptional is its gift for gab.But it takes more than a great script filled with great talk.  It takes actors who can pull it off.  But luckily, THE GILMORE GIRLS is filled with a bevy of competent actors who are completely capable of handling every nuance of the script.  All are at least solid, but in Lauren Graham the show has someone who is exceptional.  The show would be very good even with a lesser actress, but she is absolutely perfect as Lorelai Gilmore.There is never a point at which this show is ever less than completely entertaining, and it often puts me in mind of ""A Prarie Home Companion,"" with the way that you get to know each character in the town of Stars Hollow.  Although Lauren Graham dominates the show, the series in fact features an ensemble supporting cast, with each person bringing a perfect additional touch to the show.And for all literate folks the show is an especial delight.  How many shows routinely drop names like Stella (from STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE), Proust, Oscar Levant, Marlon Perkins (the Wild Kingdom guy), Tolstoy, John Muir, Thoreau, and so forth, as well as extended discussions of ennui.  And the musical references are consistently cool:  PJ Harvey, Belle and Sebastian, Nico, Blur, and a host of others.  I get all the references, but I think even if you don't it would be fun for once not to have a show whose scripts are directed at the lowest common denominator but no higher.I have to add that I love the interaction between Lorelai and Rory.  They have what is without question the finest onscreen relationship between parent and child on TV.  Oh, and I'd like to add that more than one person (well, two) has told me that Lorelai and Rory remind them of me and my daughter, so I like to keep that in mind when I watch the show.",5,A show whereon talk is elevated to high art,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,3083,"['are', 'only', 'three', 'shows', 'know', 'where', 'act', 'conversation', 'elevated', 'status', 'high', 'art', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'THE', 'WEST', 'WING', 'early', 'seasons', 'only', 'THE', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'three', 'shows', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'common', 'other', 'ways', 'three', 'revel', 'great', 'talk', 'Other', 'shows', 'have', 'good', 'talk', 'three', 'have', 'great', 'great', 'talk', 'Take', 'just', 'sample', 'delivered', 'machine', 'gun', 'pace', 'GRANDMA', 'were', 'phone.GRANDPA', 'Long', 'distance.LORELAI', 'God', 'GRANDPA', 'London.LORELAI', 'God', 'London', 'GRANDPA', 'mother', 'London.LORELAI', 'mother', 'God', 'GRANDPA', 'Lorelai.LORELAI', 'So', 'God', 'woman', 'GRANDPA', 'Lorelai.LORELAI', 'relative', 'so', 'cool', ""'m"", 'gon', 'totally', 'ask', 'favors.Series', 'creator', 'Amy', 'Sherman-Palladino', 'self-proclaimed', 'model', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore', 'writer', 'unreasonably', 'large', 'number', 'brilliant', 'screenplays', 'absolute', 'genius', 'talk', 'Few', 'movies', 'television', 'series', 'apart', 'above', 'mentioned', 'BUFFY', 'WEST', 'WING-early-seasons-only', 'contain', 'better', 'talk', 'watch', 'episodes', 'series', 'persistent', 'grin', 'unceasing', 'delight', 'manner', 'show', 'mere', 'talk', 'something', 'greater', 'mere', 'talk', 'many', 'other', 'ways', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'what', 'exceptional', 'gift', 'gab.But', 'more', 'great', 'script', 'filled', 'great', 'talk', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'luckily', 'THE', 'GILMORE', 'GIRLS', 'filled', 'bevy', 'competent', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'capable', 'handling', 'nuance', 'script', 'are', 'least', 'solid', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'show', 'someone', 'who', 'exceptional', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'lesser', 'actress', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Lorelai', 'Gilmore.There', 'never', 'point', 'show', 'ever', 'less', 'completely', 'entertaining', 'often', 'mind', 'A', 'Prarie', 'Home', 'Companion', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'town', 'Stars', 'Hollow', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'show', 'series', 'fact', 'features', 'ensemble', 'supporting', 'cast', 'person', 'bringing', 'perfect', 'additional', 'touch', 'show.And', 'literate', 'folks', 'show', 'especial', 'delight', 'How', 'many', 'shows', 'routinely', 'drop', 'names', 'Stella', 'STREETCAR', 'NAMED', 'DESIRE', 'Proust', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'Marlon', 'Perkins', 'Wild', 'Kingdom', 'guy', 'Tolstoy', 'John', 'Muir', 'Thoreau', 'so', 'forth', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'discussions', 'ennui', 'musical', 'references', 'are', 'consistently', 'cool', 'PJ', 'Harvey', 'Belle', 'Sebastian', 'Nico', 'Blur', 'host', 'others', 'get', 'references', 'think', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'would', 'be', 'fun', 'once', 'not', 'have', 'show', 'scripts', 'are', 'directed', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'higher.I', 'have', 'add', 'love', 'interaction', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'have', 'what', 'question', 'finest', 'onscreen', 'relationship', 'parent', 'child', 'TV', 'Oh', ""'d"", 'like', 'add', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'well', 'two', 'told', 'Lorelai', 'Rory', 'remind', 'daughter', 'so', 'like', 'keep', 'mind', 'when', 'watch', 'show']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1

I think it is great that more and more shows are exploring the positive aspects of different kinds of relationships.  Everwood is a show about a father (trying to be one) and his angry, resentful son. Gilmore Girls explores the single mom dynamic and does it very, very well.Most of the credit, although the cast is very good from top to bottom, has to go to Lauren Graham.  She's without question one of the best actresses on television today.  She is fast, witty, and has a charismatic personality that draws you in.  Scott Cohen (Max Medina) states in the interviews, ""If you're going to act across from Lauren Graham, you'd better bring your 'A' game, because she'll leave you in the dust otherwise.""  She plays a cheerful, exciting mom who drinks coffee by the bucketful, loves to eat pizza and chocolate, and runs a small Inn in the town of Star's Hollow.  I'm not a girl, but I can quickly imagine that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) is the kind of mom that many girls envision for themselves.  She's more than a mom to her daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel), she's her best friend.  Don't think that Lorelai is soft on her daughter when Rory finds herself in a pickle or has done something wrong, as Lorelai can quickly shift to a very concerned and disappointed mother.Cast includes Scott Patterson (Luke) who runs a small diner.  He doesn't talk much, but it's obvious that there is a connection between he and Lorelai.  Their witty banter is some of the best on television.There's Melissa McCarthy (Suki), Lorelai's friend and cook at the Inn.  She's a bubbly, energetic woman who's a bit clumsy despite her great culinary abilities, such as accidentally smashing a pan into the face of another chef.There's Yanic Truesdale as the Inn's stuffy, French concierge who believes everyone else is a fool.  Great character and wonderfully played by Yanic.Also, there is Keiko Agena as Rory's Korean best friend, Lane.Edward Herrmann and Kelly Bishop play Lorelai's wealthy parents who live in Hartford, Connecticuit.  Both are fantastic actors and great additions to the show.Alexis Bledel is the new-comer to acting.  Therefore, I cannot fault her for her portrayal of Rory Gilmore as a bit wooden and lacking a certain charisma.  This is most evident in the first half of the season.  Alexis picks up quick though, as she quickly is able to get a handle on her character.  I haven't seen any of the other seasons, so I'm going to assume that things improve for her.  She never takes away from the show, however.  But many times, seasoned actors can inadvertently show a contrast to someone who has little acting experience.The town of Star's Hollow is the kind of place I've always dreamed of living.  It's fun, friendly, and has all the characters of a small town.  Season 1 focuses on Lorelai's re-connection with her parents as well as Rory's getting to know her grandparents.  It also focuses on possible romances for both women.People may assume that this is a ""girl's"" show.  You'd be selling it short if you arrive at this conclusion without seeing it.  The acting is superb, the stories delightful, and the atmosphere fun and charming.Give the Gilmore Girls a chance, and you'll find as I did, that they very quickly grow on you.",4,Gilmore Girls is a real treat,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,3346,"['Gilmore', 'Girls', 'great', 'show', 'exploring', 'relationship', '32-year', 'old', 'mom', '16-year-old', 'daughter', 'think', 'great', 'more', 'more', 'shows', 'are', 'exploring', 'positive', 'aspects', 'different', 'kinds', 'relationships', 'Everwood', 'show', 'father', 'trying', 'be', 'one', 'angry', 'resentful', 'son', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'single', 'mom', 'dynamic', 'very', 'very', 'well.Most', 'credit', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'top', 'bottom', 'go', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'question', 'one', 'best', 'actresses', 'television', 'today', 'fast', 'witty', 'charismatic', 'personality', 'Scott', 'Cohen', 'Max', 'Medina', 'interviews', ""'re"", 'going', 'act', 'Lauren', 'Graham', ""'d"", 'better', 'bring', 'game', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'dust', 'otherwise', 'cheerful', 'exciting', 'mom', 'who', 'coffee', 'bucketful', 'eat', 'pizza', 'chocolate', 'small', 'Inn', 'town', 'Star', 'Hollow', ""'m"", 'not', 'girl', 'can', 'quickly', 'imagine', 'Lorelai', 'Lauren', 'Graham', 'kind', 'mom', 'many', 'girls', 'envision', 'more', 'mom', 'daughter', 'Rory', 'Alexis', 'Bledel', 'best', 'friend', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lorelai', 'soft', 'daughter', 'when', 'Rory', 'pickle', 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'Lorelai', 'can', 'quickly', 'shift', 'very', 'concerned', 'disappointed', 'mother.Cast', 'Scott', 'Patterson', 'Luke', 'who', 'small', 'diner', ""n't"", 'talk', 'much', 'obvious', 'connection', 'Lorelai', 'witty', 'banter', 'best', 'Melissa', 'McCarthy', 'Suki', 'Lorelai', 'friend', 'cook', 'Inn', 'bubbly', 'energetic', 'woman', 'who', 'bit', 'clumsy', 'great', 'culinary', 'abilities', 'such', 'accidentally', 'smashing', 'pan', 'face', 'chef.There', 'Yanic', 'Truesdale', 'Inn', 'stuffy', 'French', 'concierge', 'who', 'everyone', 'else', 'fool', 'Great', 'character', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Yanic.Also', 'Keiko', 'Agena', 'Rory', 'Korean', 'best', 'friend', 'Lane.Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Kelly', 'Bishop', 'play', 'Lorelai', 'wealthy', 'parents', 'who', 'live', 'Hartford', 'Connecticuit', 'are', 'fantastic', 'actors', 'great', 'additions', 'show.Alexis', 'Bledel', 'new-comer', 'acting', 'Therefore', 'can', 'not', 'fault', 'portrayal', 'Rory', 'Gilmore', 'bit', 'wooden', 'lacking', 'certain', 'charisma', 'most', 'evident', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'Alexis', 'up', 'quick', 'though', 'quickly', 'able', 'get', 'handle', 'character', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'things', 'improve', 'never', 'away', 'show', 'however', 'many', 'times', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'can', 'inadvertently', 'show', 'contrast', 'someone', 'who', 'little', 'acting', 'experience.The', 'town', 'Star', 'Hollow', 'kind', 'place', ""'ve"", 'always', 'dreamed', 'living', 'fun', 'friendly', 'characters', 'small', 'town', 'Season', '1', 'focuses', 'Lorelai', 're-connection', 'parents', 'as', 'well', 'Rory', 'getting', 'know', 'grandparents', 'also', 'possible', 'romances', 'women.People', 'may', 'assume', 'girl', 'show', ""'d"", 'be', 'selling', 'short', 'arrive', 'conclusion', 'seeing', 'acting', 'superb', 'stories', 'delightful', 'atmosphere', 'fun', 'charming.Give', 'Gilmore', 'Girls', 'chance', ""'ll"", 'find', 'did', 'very', 'quickly', 'grow']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1

The premise is a cute one and there are plenty of fun times had by all, especially the introduction of Rory's boyfriend Dean, and Lorelai's romantic life.Despite the fact that I like this show, I am a bit tired of some elements. Lorelai and her daughter have awful eating habits. They seem to survive off of pizza, burgers, and poptarts and don't gain a pound. Seldom (except when they go to their grandparents do these two ladies eat a normal meal). Second, I do get a bit tired of the adult Lorelai's spastic jokes. The humor seems forced and dumb rather than witty and humorous as the writer's intended. Also, sometimes the small town atmosphere is TOO quirky, and too strange.

No friggin creeks that you wish the series' namesake to drown in.  Nothing but a well-written, wonderfully cast show that is long overdue for a DVD release.  When the first season DVD release hits shelves, the fourth season should be close to wrapping up on the WB, and hopefully will continue everything about the show that made the first episodes so enjoyable.Set in a fictional Connecticut town called Stars Hollow, The Gilmore Girls follows the lives of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, a a single mother and teenage daughter who share a bond that is as much best friends as it is that of a mother and child.  The series begins with Rory's acceptance into the prestigious Chilton Academy and Lorelai's frantic desire to make that happen, which much to her chagrin, involves the help of her own mother, Emily Gilmore (played by the excellent Kelly Bishop) and father Richard (Edward Herman).  Growing up the rebellious daughter of wealthy society types and becoming pregnant at age 16 didn't exactly endear them to each other.  It is Lorelai's relationship with her parents that drives much of her character's motivation.While life as a single mother might be hard, Lorelai is not without a support system.  Stars Hollow is populated with an impressive collection of colorful characters, from the gruff, flannel-wearing diner owner, Luke, to Lorelai's coworker and best friend Sookie and the annoying Frenchman, Michel.Rory, too, has a group of close friends and even closer enemies.  Lane Kim, daughter of a Korean Bible beater is the music obsessed best friend, Dean (Jared Padelecki) is her first boyfriend and Paris, her academic and social rival.  As is the case with basically anything on the WB, Chad Michael Murray also finds his way into her life, as do Madeline and Louise, Paris' oversexed friends and Chilton classmates.Some of the highlight episodes from this debut season include Concert Interupticus - which featured a Bangles performance and hinted that there might be some degree of feeling beneath Paris' chilly exterior, and Emily in Wonderland - where Emily redecorates Rory's bedroom.

The witty bantering between her and Rory (if that is how you spell her name) is refreshing TV. BUT in between these high points you get a true glimpse of spoiled, self-involved, bratty Americans. Their wise cracks turn into cynicism after they make fun of anything nice and good. The entire ""I was abused because I was born into a wealthy privileged family with parents who wanted something for me"" bit got old and actually never got off the ground. It was more like ""I was abused by my bad decisions born out of total selfish behavior"" bit. I would have loved to have had had a foot in the door of LauraLai's parents' world. . . . her parents as a great aunt and uncle or something. The show pulls you in to the love stories only to let you down as the ""heroines"" turn on their lovers and of course blame their wealthy backgrounds. They toss aside good guys who treat them well just because. They rattle off these lines of just words as fast as they can, usually yelling, gets old and annoying after a while. It is supposed to be intelligent banter somehow, we are led to believe. It was really a disappointment to watch these train wrecks in motion. But I must say . . . it is reality for some people. How many times have you known someone who just dug their own grave out of total immaturity and you just had to sit around watching them to because they refused to listen to any advice. They had everything and just thumbed their nose at it claiming to have the high moral ground. I just think I wouldn't like most of these people in real life as the ones similar to them I know in real life . . . I distance myself from. Funny irony is no matter how much LaurLai makes fun of her parents and her upbringing and no matter how many teary emotional outburts we witness between her and her parents over how ""abused"" she was she runs right back to them for help when the going gets rough.

As much as I love the dynamics of Rory-Lorelei relationship, the Lorelei-Emily is the one that truly made me a fan of the show. And I guess season 1 gave us a lot of stories about that, because as the season goes on, even though they still have conflicts, they are in better terms now generally compared to the first 2 seasons.The show is populated by great supporting characters, my favorite besides Emily of course (played to perfection by Kelly Bishop) is Paris (played effortlessly by Liza Weil), the overachiever who won't quit. I miss when Rory and Paris were archrivals. I also love the audiophile Lane, out of this planet Kirk, omnipresent Taylor, bowtied Richard, horny Miss Pattie and the sweet as candy Sookie.Some of the standout episodes of Season 1 are:-Pilot (one of the best pilots I have seen, great setup for the characters)-The Lorelei's First Day at Chilton-Rory's Birthday Parties-Kiss and Tell-Rory's dance (great dramatic showdown for Emily and Lorelei, ""She's gonna get pregnant like you"")-Christopher Returns-The breakup Part 2 (great Rory episode, and great ending)-Ps I Lo..

Even in the 1st season, it showed that it had potential to become a great show. When I first saw an ad for Gilmore Girls one day when I was watching tv, I thought to myself, ""Oh great. Another feel good show. I'm not going to waste my time with that."" I am so glad that I eventually changed my mind and started to watch it. I think that I started watching it when there were reruns on ABC Family since I started on the 1st season. I immediately became hooked. It's amazing how the actors and actresses can talk as fast as they do. Most of the references made go right by me. That's why the Gilmorisms guide that comes with almost all of the DVDs except season 5 comes in handy. I feel that it's better to review the 1st season of Gilmore Girls to start out with at least since that is where it all began.

Ever since The First episode aired all the way back in 1999 I have been in love with the Characters, Town, and writting of this heartwarming, yet comical tale of a Mother and Daughter (Who are the fastest talkers in the east) Growing up together in a small New England Town (which has residents to rival those of Northern Exposure's Cicely).  At the time of this writting the show is in the middle of it's fourth season and it still hasn't lost its luster (and there is no end in sight).In the First season we are introduced to Lorelai Gilmore (a 32 year-old mother of one, who runs the Independence Inn, and has a ""stressed"" relationship with her parents), and Rory Gilmore (16 year-old daughter of Lorelai, who is very intelligent for her age).  The Two characters seem more like best-friends then mother/daughter, and they love each other very much.  During the first episode Rory is acepted to Chilton, a private school which will give her a chance to to fulfill her dream (attend Harvard).  But there is a problem, Lorelai cannot afford the tution: Inter Richard and Emily (Lorelai parents, who have a very ugly and colorful history with there daughter).  Richard and Emily agree to pay for Rory's schooling if the girls agree to come to dinner more often (52 times a year, instead of once).Throughout the first season we are introduced to a hole cast and extremly quirky and lovable characters sucha s: Luke (the owner of the local coffee shop, and Lorelai's best friend), Lane (Rory's best friend, and daughter to the most religious Antique store owner in history), Kirk (a 33 year old man, who has bad social skills and skill lives with his mother), Babett (the next door neighber with a heart of gold, but that isn't necessarly a good thing), Miss Patty (ex-Broadway dancer and local ""know-it-all""), and last but certainly not least Taylor (The local buissy buddy that needs his nose in everybody's buisness).Throughout the First season the girls will come to grips with many struggles: Rory moving to a new school and realizing that she won't be accepted with open arms, Lorelai coming to grips with her parents which havn't been in her life for many years, A girls first love, a girls frist enemy, and the search for the best cup of coffee.This First Season DVD includes all 21 season one Episodes which are: Pilot, The Lorelais' First Day at chilton, Kill me NOw, The Deer Hunters, Cinnamon's Wake, Rory's Birthday Parties, Kiss and Tell, Love and WAr and Snow, Rory's Dance, Forgiveness and Stuff, Paris is Burning, Double Date, Concert Interruptus, That Damn Donna Reed, Christopher Returns, Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers, The Breakup - part 2, The Third Lorelai, Emily in Wonderland, P.S.

This is not some sappy chick fest, but instead is the ongoing story of a single mom and her precocious daughter, the small quirky town they live in, its interesting inhabitants, and the snooty school that the girl Rory attends because she wants to be Harvard-bound.  The dialogue is rapid-fire, with hilarious banter.  The other people, such as Luke, Miss Patty, Sookie, and the snobbish guy at the inn's front desk, are all intriguing to watch, as are the obnoxious students at Rory's school.  What's even better is the obligatory Friday night dinner at Lorelai's parents' house, where the wayward daughter who gave birth at 16 must continue to face her uptight parents so they will keep paying  Rory's tuition.Great fun and some of the best writing from the world of TV.",5,Great dialogue and quirky characters abound,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,859,"['missed', 'when', 'was', 'TV', 'am', 'glad', 'be', 'catching', 'up', 'now', 'DVD', 'not', 'sappy', 'chick', 'fest', 'instead', 'ongoing', 'story', 'single', 'mom', 'precocious', 'daughter', 'small', 'quirky', 'town', 'live', 'interesting', 'inhabitants', 'snooty', 'school', 'girl', 'Rory', 'attends', 'be', 'Harvard-bound', 'dialogue', 'rapid-fire', 'hilarious', 'banter', 'other', 'people', 'such', 'Luke', 'Miss', 'Patty', 'Sookie', 'snobbish', 'guy', 'inn', 'front', 'desk', 'are', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'are', 'obnoxious', 'students', 'Rory', 'school', 'What', 'even', 'better', 'obligatory', 'Friday', 'night', 'dinner', 'Lorelai', 'parents', 'house', 'where', 'wayward', 'daughter', 'who', 'gave', 'birth', '16', 'must', 'continue', 'face', 'uptight', 'parents', 'will', 'keep', 'paying', 'Rory', 'tuition.Great', 'fun', 'best', 'writing', 'world', 'TV']",Gilmore Girls: Season 1

Every episode makes for riveting viewing, and the great casting makes all the difference...the drama centers around the life and exploits of single mother Lorelai Gilmore [the amazing Lauren Graham] who raises her only child Rory [stunning Alexis Bledel]in the idyllic town of Stars Hollow, somewhere in Connecticut. Its an amazing drama...every episode here in Season One makes you really come to know and love the characters, both main and secondary. We come to care about what happens to Lorelai & Rory...in Season One, 16 year old Rory gets accepted into the prestigious private school Chilton, and Lorelai has to grapple with the problem of how to finance it, and out of desperation approaches her estanged parents for help. The chemistry between the two leads as mother and daughter is electrifying and altogether credible...Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore are portrayed as stuffy, upper-class people who use money as the means to keep tabs on their daughter and granddaughter. Of course, the stories go deeper than that, and the characters themselves develop in greater depth as the series goes on...but herein lies the chram in Gilmore Girls...the dialogue, witty repartee and stellar acting from all characters make this a show that grows from strength to strength and makes an addict of the viewer.The residents of Stars Hollow are an eccentric bunch indeed - be it Luke of Luke's Diner, Ms Patty the dance teacher, Taylor the town councilman,Michel the crabby concierge, Sookie St James the irreverent cook and BFF of Lorelai, Lane Kim as Rory's sidekick - we come to love each of these characters for their role in the series.Watching these episodes is like a reunion of old friends - and every fall, I rewatch the seasons of Gilmore Girls, and get the feeling that I'm part of something special and magical, a feeling like I'm truly home.
