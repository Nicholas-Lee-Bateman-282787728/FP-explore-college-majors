All the first season episodes have been remastered. Very few artifacts are present.

1455788,A31ABMWNVX9QG8,B005DLN1LG,David Smith,"[0, 0]","I was very pleased to see that the full first season of ""Medical Center"" was released on DVD and I scooped it right up.  Chad Everett is in fine form as the highly regarded, passionate and humanistic physician, Dr. Joe Gannon.  Gannon is a constant advocate for his patients and ensures they get the care and treatment that is best for them.  As drama would have it, Gannon runs up against an antagonist in almost every episode.  Dr. Gannon almost always wins out.  His older boss, Dr. Paul Lochner, is earnest but not as talented medically as Dr. Gannon.  Lochner is more of a bureaucratic administrator who ensures that he reins in Dr. Gannon just enough to ensure he doesn't get into trouble.  The storylines are ground-breaking for the time and are compelling and well-written.  This was when television used highly professional, mature writers who could deliver the material without dumbing it down for the audience.  The guest actors and actresses are also top-notch and add greatly to the success of this show.  As always, Chad Everett delivers outstanding performances in every episode.  I noted that in the first season, the dynamic opening theme and sequence is not yet around.  I think it started in the second season.  It really gets one in the mood for the show.  Also, I should add my profound condolences to Chad Everett who lost his lovely wife Shelby earlier this year in Westlake Village.

1455790,AJDOJANK50QJV,B005DLN1LG,D. McSherry,"[10, 10]","I purchased this DVD set with an Amazon Gift Card. Watching these videos, I know now why CBS scheduled this series at 9:00 p.m. in Los Angeles, because by that time little kids would be asleep, and the adults could watch this medical drama.  There's no way as a little kid I would have understood this.I was impressed with the quality, the content, the medical terminology, and the seriousness of Medical Center.  The majority of Medical Center is new to me, since I had only seen a few episodes in syndication as a teenager in the 1980's.  Like other reviewers mentioned, issues were covered tactfully, and I applaud the Respect Life aspect that Dr. Gannon upheld in several episodes (I don't think you would see that on Gray's Anatomy). Dr. Gannon and his colleagues also show the human side of medicine, where external factors and family issues are explored.I know Chad Everett spent a great deal of time researching and preparing for the role of Dr. Gannon.  Oftentimes, he would go on rounds with real-life medical students, interns, and residents, as well as watch surgeries.  I read that real-life nurses and a real-life anesthesiologist were often used in the operating room scenes.While the show does look a little dated, but I always like to see the old big cars, particularly a black Chrysler Imperial and the old smooth riding Cadillac Ambulances. I happened to notice some Brown Bomber uniforms too on the ambulance drivers.  It took me about 20 minutes to recognize guest stars Tom Skerritt and Robert Pine (I recognized Walter Koenig immediately as a 4th year medical student), and I kept waiting for guest star Pat Hingle to call Batman on the telephone.  I was also impressed with the lady psychiatrist - Dr. Jeanne Bartlett - that Dr. Gannon would date occasionally (she was good looking too - I never heard of Corinne Camacho before Medical Center), and I did see the episode where Chad Everett's real-life wife Shelby Grant appeared when he went on vacation.  It is impressive that she and Chad Everett were married for 45 years until death do us part.""The Center"" reminded me of some of the older hospital buildings that were still around in Houston and San Antonio (particularly Methodist Hospital) when I was in college.  The outside shots for ""The Center"" were UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, adjacent to the UCLA campus.  This allowed for location use of the campus settings. This set was also used for a ""Medical Story"" episode that I recall seeing on late night TV one night in the mid-1980's. Today (2012), ""The Center"" hospital building is still there, but I believe it has been remodeled and is now a research/office/classroom institute since the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center opened across the street.While I would have liked to have seen Dr. Brackett appear in a cameo (I know Emergency! was a different network and Johnny and Roy were part of LA County FD, not LA City FD), this was an excellent drama series.  Hopefully, season 2 of Medical Center will be released soon. Please watch this series, Hollywood needs to bring quality shows like Medical Center back to television.",4,Appreciated the Thoroughness and Seriousness of Medicine,1335052800,"04 22, 2012",2012,3114,"['purchased', 'DVD', 'set', 'Amazon', 'Gift', 'Card', 'Watching', 'videos', 'know', 'now', 'why', 'CBS', 'scheduled', 'series', '9:00', 'p.m.', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'time', 'little', 'kids', 'would', 'be', 'asleep', 'adults', 'could', 'watch', 'medical', 'drama', 'way', 'little', 'kid', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'this.I', 'was', 'impressed', 'quality', 'content', 'medical', 'terminology', 'seriousness', 'Medical', 'Center', 'majority', 'Medical', 'Center', 'new', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'few', 'episodes', 'syndication', 'teenager', '1980', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'issues', 'were', 'covered', 'tactfully', 'applaud', 'Respect', 'Life', 'aspect', 'Dr.', 'Gannon', 'upheld', 'several', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'see', 'Gray', 'Anatomy', 'Dr.', 'Gannon', 'colleagues', 'also', 'show', 'human', 'side', 'medicine', 'where', 'external', 'factors', 'family', 'issues', 'are', 'explored.I', 'know', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'spent', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'researching', 'preparing', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Gannon', 'Oftentimes', 'would', 'go', 'rounds', 'real-life', 'medical', 'students', 'interns', 'residents', 'as', 'well', 'watch', 'surgeries', 'read', 'real-life', 'nurses', 'real-life', 'anesthesiologist', 'were', 'often', 'used', 'operating', 'room', 'show', 'look', 'little', 'dated', 'always', 'like', 'see', 'old', 'big', 'cars', 'particularly', 'black', 'Chrysler', 'Imperial', 'old', 'smooth', 'riding', 'Cadillac', 'Ambulances', 'happened', 'notice', 'Brown', 'Bomber', 'uniforms', 'too', 'ambulance', 'drivers', 'took', '20', 'minutes', 'recognize', 'guest', 'stars', 'Tom', 'Skerritt', 'Robert', 'Pine', 'recognized', 'Walter', 'Koenig', 'immediately', '4th', 'year', 'medical', 'student', 'kept', 'waiting', 'guest', 'star', 'Pat', 'Hingle', 'call', 'Batman', 'telephone', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'lady', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Jeanne', 'Bartlett', 'Dr.', 'Gannon', 'would', 'date', 'occasionally', 'was', 'good', 'looking', 'too', 'never', 'heard', 'Corinne', 'Camacho', 'Medical', 'Center', 'did', 'see', 'episode', 'where', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Shelby', 'Grant', 'appeared', 'when', 'went', 'vacation', 'impressive', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'were', 'married', '45', 'years', 'death', 'do', 'part', 'Center', 'reminded', 'older', 'hospital', 'buildings', 'were', 'still', 'around', 'Houston', 'San', 'Antonio', 'particularly', 'Methodist', 'Hospital', 'when', 'was', 'college', 'outside', 'shots', 'Center', 'were', 'UCLA', 'Medical', 'Center', 'Westwood', 'adjacent', 'UCLA', 'campus', 'allowed', 'location', 'use', 'campus', 'settings', 'set', 'was', 'also', 'used', 'Medical', 'Story', 'episode', 'recall', 'seeing', 'late', 'night', 'TV', 'one', 'night', 'mid-1980', 'Today', '2012', 'Center', 'hospital', 'building', 'still', 'there', 'believe', 'been', 'remodeled', 'now', 'research/office/classroom', 'institute', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'UCLA', 'Medical', 'Center', 'opened', 'street.While', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Brackett', 'appear', 'cameo', 'know', 'Emergency', 'was', 'different', 'network', 'Johnny', 'Roy', 'were', 'part', 'LA', 'County', 'FD', 'not', 'LA', 'City', 'FD', 'was', 'excellent', 'drama', 'series', 'Hopefully', 'season', '2', 'Medical', 'Center', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'soon', 'Please', 'watch', 'series', 'Hollywood', 'bring', 'quality', 'shows', 'Medical', 'Center', 'back', 'television']",Medical Center: Season 1

1455792,AK5IU1VX89CZM,B005DLN1LG,foghorn,"[0, 0]","Obviously being from the 70's, the show in some respects is very dated, from the music, dress, and even some of the storylines and sub-plots.....but make no mistake, Medical Center was cutting edge for it's time with regard to most topics it hit on, from child abuse to homosexuality to transgenderism to V.D....you name it. Also in most cases the medical conditions that were discussed were done so accurately and at least in some clinical detail. James Daly as Paul Lochner played a perfect conservative foil to Joe Gannon's &#34;no-holds-barred&#34; personality. And there were so many great guest stars....William Shatner, Lois Nettleton, Martin Sheen, Lee Grant, Ed Asner, Jack Carter, the list goes on and on.I noticed most of the reviewers here seem to be women and almost all have something to say about Chad Everett's sex appeal. OK.... we get it. Hopefully the positive reviews are based on more substance than that! For the record, we men weren't entirely cheated out of eye candy on the show either....for one example, Sheila Larken, who played a nurse/psychologist on a number of episodes, was more than easy on the eyes! But nostalgia-wise this is a great series, and season 1 has a very clean video transfer as well.

I had never seen the show so it so it's all new to me, and I actually am enjoying watching the available seasons with her.With this first season it is quite the social commentary of the &#34;issues of the day&#34;, in this case 1969, as they relate to 2013. Some episodes are honestly hilarious at times looking back with todays standards in mind, as even Joe Gannon while probably a suave and fancy dresser for that era looks out of place with the dress and style of today. And the 'wild teens' of that era all wearing 'nice clothes'? Ties and sport coats abound but it is still a good show.Honestly this is better fare than so much of what's on TV now with so many 'reality shows'.So, after all this ramble, the 26 episodes look great with excellent transfers to DVD, the color is also great, actually better than I recall for color TV's back in that era, when I was about 12. There are no extras whatsoever just the episodes but you can like I did research the series on line and find out information about the show and stars. Oh and a lot of stars from the 1980s and beyond apparently got an early start with this series, it's interesting to see them before they became real stars, or villains in the case of O.J.

When the first season was recently released I purchased it immediately, and was instantly transported back to my early teens. The DVD's were of very good quality, although the sound had to be turned up quite a bit on my player, but that aside, I was impressed with the picture, and general good quality of the DVD's. More than that, I was very impressed with the technical aspects of the show that one did not fully appreciate when 12 years of age. I am now in the medical field and everything in the show is quite accurate. I was totally surprised.. a show before its time and better than some of the medical shows around now. Many important issues of the time were brought to light, and watching these years later is very interesting. Of course, it helped considerably that the star of the show, Chad Everett was extremely handsome, and a very good actor bringing compassion and caring to the role of Dr Joseph Gannon. It was very sad to hear of his recent passing. I look forward to the other six seasons being released and they cannot come quickly enough for me. Definately a must have !

The opening beating heart sequence had an immediate impact on me, and truly indicated how forward thinking the storyline coverage of this tv series was.  I have since been introduced to such series as ""Medical Story"", """"St. Elsewhere"" and the phenomenal ""Chicago Hope"", ""ER"", and ""Three Rivers"".  These have all impacted on me greatly, but an episode from Medical Center's second season titled ""Trial By Terror"" remains freshly in mind, where Dr. Gannon is involved in an automobile accident - risking permanent blindness by his injuries.

1455807,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B005DLN1LG,trebe,"[0, 0]","With a cool funky theme song featuring a dive bomber sound effect, Medical Center (1969-75) was a program that I remember occasionally watching when it was originally broadcast.  Dealing with serious often life threatening issues, it was not the kind of show that would generally be of interest to a kid, however revisiting this series now, it's easy to understand the program's appeal.Medical dramas were nothing new to television, but this one featuring the young and handsome Chad Everett as doctor Joe Gannon, was a little different.  Driven by strong moral and philosophical convictions, Gannon was physician prone to dramatic and fiery behavior.  His proactive and often emotional approach, often makes for some pretty compelling viewing.Airing on CBS, the program was set at a facility located on the campus of a university in southern California, where doctor Paul Lochner (James Daly) serves as the head administrator.  Built on mutual respect and trust, the relationship between Lochner and Gannon, is one of the series' key elements, as the Lochner has to balance medical issues, against the practical and legal concerns of running a hospital.  Both Daly and Everett are terrific, consistently delivering compelling performances.The situations presented are often provocative, and highly emotional, and the program usually takes an in-depth look at the patients and others involved, helping to establish a solid connection with the viewer.  Medical Center benefits from a wonderful guest cast from the era, as the hospital provides an excellent setting to feature characters from diverse backgrounds, and ethnicities.  Facing emotionally charged situations, the actors rise to the occasion, and deliver some special performances.Like many medical shows, things often get overdramatic, and some of the situations are a bit clich&eacute;d, but Medical Center usually manages to touch the heart in some fashion.  With emotions running high, and lives on the line, the steely-eyed Gannon, is a white knight in a lab coat, a caring physician that most of can only dream about having.  It's easy to see why the late Chad Everett was such a heartthrob at the time, It's easy to see why the late Chad Everett was such a heartthrob at the time,The quality of the writing is very good, and while many of the themes are still relevant today, the series also very much reflects the time when it was produced, in terms of medicine, technology, and social conventions, such as the effects of illegal drugs.The 6 DVD set features 26 episodes, which while not subtitled, do look remarkably good, with almost no signs of dirt or print damage.  The only disappointment for me was that Season One does not feature the ""dive bomber"" theme.  Both Medical Center, and ABC'sMarcus Welby M.D.premiered in 1969, and the timing was apparently right for medical dramas, as both programs did well in the ratings, and would run for seven seasons.  Marcus Welby became the most popular show on television during the 1970-71 season, with Medical Center coming in at a very respectable #8.",4,"meet joe gannon, a doctor who really gets involved...",1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,3068,"['cool', 'funky', 'theme', 'song', 'featuring', 'dive', 'bomber', 'sound', 'effect', 'Medical', 'Center', '1969-75', 'was', 'program', 'remember', 'occasionally', 'watching', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'Dealing', 'serious', 'often', 'life', 'threatening', 'issues', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'show', 'would', 'generally', 'be', 'interest', 'kid', 'however', 'revisiting', 'series', 'now', 'easy', 'understand', 'program', 'appeal.Medical', 'dramas', 'were', 'nothing', 'new', 'television', 'one', 'featuring', 'young', 'handsome', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'doctor', 'Joe', 'Gannon', 'was', 'little', 'different', 'Driven', 'strong', 'moral', 'philosophical', 'convictions', 'Gannon', 'was', 'physician', 'prone', 'dramatic', 'fiery', 'behavior', 'proactive', 'often', 'emotional', 'approach', 'often', 'pretty', 'compelling', 'viewing.Airing', 'CBS', 'program', 'was', 'set', 'facility', 'located', 'campus', 'university', 'southern', 'California', 'where', 'doctor', 'Paul', 'Lochner', 'James', 'Daly', 'head', 'administrator', 'Built', 'mutual', 'respect', 'trust', 'relationship', 'Lochner', 'Gannon', 'one', 'series', 'key', 'elements', 'Lochner', 'balance', 'medical', 'issues', 'practical', 'legal', 'concerns', 'running', 'hospital', 'Daly', 'Everett', 'are', 'terrific', 'consistently', 'delivering', 'compelling', 'performances.The', 'situations', 'presented', 'are', 'often', 'provocative', 'highly', 'emotional', 'program', 'usually', 'in-depth', 'look', 'patients', 'others', 'involved', 'helping', 'establish', 'solid', 'connection', 'viewer', 'Medical', 'Center', 'benefits', 'wonderful', 'guest', 'cast', 'era', 'hospital', 'excellent', 'setting', 'feature', 'characters', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'ethnicities', 'Facing', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'situations', 'actors', 'rise', 'occasion', 'deliver', 'special', 'performances.Like', 'many', 'medical', 'shows', 'things', 'often', 'get', 'overdramatic', 'situations', 'are', 'bit', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'Medical', 'Center', 'usually', 'touch', 'heart', 'fashion', 'emotions', 'running', 'high', 'line', 'steely-eyed', 'Gannon', 'white', 'knight', 'lab', 'coat', 'caring', 'physician', 'most', 'can', 'only', 'dream', 'having', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'late', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'was', 'such', 'heartthrob', 'time', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'late', 'Chad', 'Everett', 'was', 'such', 'heartthrob', 'time', 'quality', 'writing', 'very', 'good', 'many', 'themes', 'are', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'series', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'was', 'produced', 'terms', 'medicine', 'technology', 'social', 'conventions', 'such', 'effects', 'illegal', 'drugs.The', '6', 'DVD', 'set', 'features', '26', 'episodes', 'not', 'subtitled', 'do', 'look', 'remarkably', 'good', 'almost', 'signs', 'dirt', 'print', 'damage', 'only', 'disappointment', 'was', 'Season', 'One', 'not', 'feature', 'dive', 'bomber', 'theme', 'Medical', 'Center', ""ABC'sMarcus"", 'Welby', 'M.D.premiered', '1969', 'timing', 'was', 'apparently', 'right', 'medical', 'dramas', 'programs', 'did', 'well', 'ratings', 'would', 'run', 'seven', 'seasons', 'Marcus', 'Welby', 'became', 'most', 'popular', 'show', 'television', '1970-71', 'season', 'Medical', 'Center', 'coming', 'very', 'respectable', '8']",Medical Center: Season 1
