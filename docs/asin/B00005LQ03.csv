Hollywood needs to stop making such arrogant, machismo, sexist and homophobic movies. It's appaling the way Hollywood portrays the way women should be treated.

664368,A200C7YQJ45LRR,B00005LQ03,"Anthony Rupert ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!!""","[6, 13]","This movie is all over the place. It starts out as just your typical sex movie, and the humor is so crude that even Howard Stern would say it's going too far. If you think any joke in this movie is funny, you'll also notice that it's the kind of joke that you wouldn't dare repeat to anyone.From what I could figure out about the plot, a group of bachelor friends make a bet with a large amount of money (I don't remember or care exactly how much), which will be given to the last bachelor standing. At one point, there are two bachelors left: Michael (Jerry O'Connell) and Kyle (Jake Busey). Michael goes to Vegas and gambles away all his money. In order to pay off his debt, he struggles to get Kyle, a gigolo, married so he can collect the 'winning' money; thus paying off the debt. While cruising around one night, Michael propositions a prostitute (Shannon Elizabeth) who turns out to be an undercover police officer named Natalie. He is taken into custody, but he gets let go under Natalie's supervision when he cries out (literally) that he was just trying to get in contact with his ex-girlfriend. Now I don't know where the ex-girlfriend thing came from, or the whole prostitution incident, for that matter. That tells you right there how disorganized everything is. Michael's ex-girlfriend is played by Jaime Pressly...I think. I couldn't even tell.Meanwhile, Steve (Horatio Sanz) is married, but he thinks his wife is cheating on him with another woman. He keeps bursting into her room whenever he sees supposed shadows and hears supposed sounds of her and another woman, but he's always wrong. The last time, however, he actually does catch her with another woman. Just as he is furiously leaving the room, the women ask him if he wants to join. And because he's a man, of course he jumps right in. What a great storyline.There are two things that were proved here. One is that watching this movie is an equivalent to self-destruction. The other thing is that it's obvious that Shannon Elizabeth will do anything for a check. Aside from this, she has appeared in such travesties as Seamless (a runaway gang of young people living on sex and gambling) and Dish Dogs (a stripper falling in love with a dish washer). She's not a bad actress, but it's really hard to tell when she subjects herself to mess like this.This movie is about as funny as an episode of The Parent 'Hood.

Mesa,"[2, 4]","It is what it is...A hilariously and wickedly mean spirited flick about bachelorism from Hollywood's comical point of view.Tomcats is satirical and purely entertaining despite the gross out testicle scene, sperm bank scene, and well, just abut any other scene. While many film afficionados or purists may consider this trash at least it is not cerebral fodder that will cause a brain hemmorhage but something to kill time on a boring Saturday afternoon with friends. Story or plot is simple and basic with a great abundance of feminine eye candy as well (Jaime Pressly and Shannon Elizabeth, and the gal who played Consuelo the maid). Even though Jerry O' Connell is no Brendan Fraser or Tom Hanks the guy is actually capable of being funny ! Jake Busey's character is utterly repulsive and gives the rest of us men a bad rap. Yet,his portrayal is so familiar of the mindset of a few immature male friends of mine from high school and college who thought women were only good for one thing (or two)!

Trust me, this is a terrible film with practically NO redeeming values.  None. It is just...just...oh geesh words fail me. I cannot possibly describe what a horrible film this was.  I watched it at the insistence of a friend (who happens to think Three Amigos is a masterpiece), and I think I lost 100 minutes of my life in doing so.  And I'm wasting more time writing this review, but I owe it to you to warn you away.  This is simply the worst film I've seen this year, bar none.  It's like the filmmakers wanted to try a Naked Gun/American Pie/Dumb &amp; Dumber type film, but they totally messed up.  The entire film is all sub-toilet humor (Want an example? How about a man eating a cancerous testicle?  Boy I'm dying of laughter...).Hey, this sort of film can be enjoyable (American Pie, for instance, is Citizen Kane compared to this Plan 9 from Outer Space wannabe) but not in this case.  In fact, if you're expecting a sexy R-rated romp from this film, you won't get it.  Better just watch American Pie.  Shannon Elizabeth is the best actor in this film (uh, that CAN'T possibly be a good comment); she is easy on the eyes, but c'mon folks, she is wasted in this film.  Jaime Pressly is wasted too.

Jerry O'Connell, most recently of ""Kangaroo Jack"" fame, is one of two buddies in a large group of male friends who have pooled money together betting who can remain single.  Finally it is down to O'Connell, an artist with some scruples, and his friend Kyle who has none.During a trip to Las Vegas, O'Connell runs up a $51K gambling debt to a hilariously vicious, yet deadpan Bill Maher and his goons.  Although there is enough in the jackpot to free O'Connell from reposession hell as Maher takes all he owns as collateral, he has even tougher odds of getting Kyle married, since he is a complete louse to all woman kind.In walks Shannon Elizabeth as a cop who once dated Kyle and was left with a role of quarters in the road for a cab after being deflowered and dumped.  She was a bridesmaid at one of the many weddings attended by the bachelor gang as they all became married one by one.  O'Connell falls in love when he meets Elizabeth, but to free his debt, ends up getting her married to Kyle, or DOES he?

A wildly graphic and surrealistic restaurant scene where Elizabeth gives birth at the table in front of a party of 15-20 earth mothers vigorously and unabashedly breast feeding?

If you are going to watch this movie you first must realize what it is, an over-the-top comedy with sight-gags and numerous sexual references.  If you go into it expecting something more profound than this, you are going to be sadly disappointed and should probably watch something else.  However if you are in the mood for this kind of comedy, this movie will not disappoint.  Jerry O'Connell is great in this movie and Shannon Elizabeth is fairly good also (though I don't think she is that great of an actress).  Jamie Presly's performance was extremely disappointing however.  Anyways, I wasn't really expecting much when I saw it in the theater (mostly due to bad reviews I had read... almost ALL bad reviews).  However, I was very pleasantly surprised as this movie was hilarious.  There were a few forced jokes that didn't quite hit the mark, but most of them did.  It was very well paced, not really getting slow very often and kept the humor coming.  I think it was cast pretty well and everyone played their roles well, I couldn't help but root for the good guys to prevail in the end.The underlying story really isn't that bad either and it does have a fairly good message to it.

They all pay money monthly into an account and the last single man of the group takes it all. The pot grows quite huge and eventually only two Tomcats remain single; Michael a sweet but somewhat stupid lad, and Kyle a sexist pig. Michael gets himself into a load of debt in a casino when he lets a red headed beauty roll the dice for him. The shady casino manager gives Michael one month to come up with the money, or he is going to kill him. The only idea that Michael gets is to get Kyle married and win the old Tomcat bet.My Opinion: This is a silly story, but it's got some laughs as well as Shannon Elizabeth and Jerry O'Connell both of whom I like, so it's not a complete waste. There is a plot to the movie, but it is fairly weak. The way Michael gets into trouble in the casino could have been done a lot better. Jake Busey is entertaining as the sexist pig whom Michael tries to marry off. In the end I think it was the love story between Michael and Natalie that saved this movie for me. It kept me rooting for Michael. Enough of the jokes hit home for me that I found the entire movie funny. The movie would be better with a few beers to help it along while you watch it.DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1 as well as full screen 1.33:1. Video quality is fine.  Sound: DD 5.1 quality ok.  Extras: Trailer and Filmography. Menus: Nothing Special. This entire DVD release is nothing special.What You Should Do:  Rent this one only if you are up for some stupid male fun. It does have a plot and the love story redeems it from being put into the same class as Saving Silverman and Dude Where's My Car both of which I despised.Related Movies To Check Out:  Bachelor Party, Varsity Blues",3,Don't You People Watch TV!,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,1788,"['Movie', 'Summary', 'group', 'young', 'men', 'who', 'call', 'Tomcats', 'make', 'pact', 'pay', 'money', 'monthly', 'account', 'last', 'single', 'man', 'group', 'pot', 'quite', 'huge', 'eventually', 'only', 'two', 'Tomcats', 'remain', 'single', 'Michael', 'sweet', 'somewhat', 'stupid', 'lad', 'Kyle', 'sexist', 'pig', 'Michael', 'load', 'debt', 'casino', 'when', 'red', 'headed', 'beauty', 'roll', 'dice', 'shady', 'casino', 'manager', 'Michael', 'one', 'month', 'come', 'up', 'money', 'going', 'kill', 'only', 'idea', 'Michael', 'get', 'Kyle', 'married', 'win', 'old', 'Tomcat', 'bet.My', 'Opinion', 'silly', 'story', 'got', 'laughs', 'as', 'well', 'Shannon', 'Elizabeth', 'Jerry', ""O'Connell"", 'whom', 'like', 'not', 'complete', 'waste', 'plot', 'movie', 'fairly', 'weak', 'way', 'Michael', 'trouble', 'casino', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'lot', 'better', 'Jake', 'Busey', 'entertaining', 'sexist', 'pig', 'whom', 'Michael', 'marry', 'off', 'end', 'think', 'was', 'love', 'story', 'Michael', 'Natalie', 'saved', 'movie', 'kept', 'rooting', 'Michael', 'Enough', 'jokes', 'hit', 'home', 'found', 'entire', 'movie', 'funny', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'few', 'beers', 'help', 'along', 'watch', 'it.DVD', 'Quality', 'Video', 'Widescreen', 'Anamorphic', '1.85:1', 'as', 'well', 'full', 'screen', '1.33:1', 'Video', 'quality', 'fine', 'Sound', 'DD', '5.1', 'quality', 'ok.', 'Extras', 'Trailer', 'Filmography', 'Menus', 'Nothing', 'Special', 'entire', 'DVD', 'release', 'nothing', 'special.What', 'Should', 'Do', 'Rent', 'one', 'only', 'are', 'up', 'stupid', 'male', 'fun', 'have', 'plot', 'love', 'story', 'being', 'put', 'same', 'class', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'Dude', 'Where', 'My', 'Car', 'despised.Related', 'Movies', 'Check', 'Out', 'Bachelor', 'Party', 'Varsity', 'Blues']",Tomcats

664395,A11JU33HMT5XPU,B00005LQ03,"S. Lawrenz ""Lendorien""","[7, 12]","This review is intended for the DVD release of TomCats.  My main purpose here is to review the DVD release, including its quality, features and layout.  I'll start with the Movie, then move on to the DVD itself.Synopsis:TomCats is a rather off-color movie that more than easily earns its R rating.  It's a sexual comedy, revolving around a bet a number of unmarried men make as to which one of them will be the last to remain single.  The bet winds up with two men still standing. One of them, (Jerry O'Connell) gets himself into debt with a bookie who threatens severe violence if the debt isn't settled.  The pot on the bet is his only way to save himself from the debt-collector.  What results is a wild rather immature attempt to get the other guy (an unabashed single lady's man) married.Review:The whole movie is rather juvenile. The humor is often based on pratfalls and sexual sight jokes, and occasionally moves into the sick and nauseating.  Case in point, in the middle of the movie there is a sequence where the other single male has a cancerous testicle amputated. It gets dropped onto the floor and a five minute chase of it through the hospital ensues, ending with someone in the hospital cafeteria accidentally eating it. The sequence is just plain gross.As one can guess, this movie was way below my sense of good taste.  Of course, I watched it anyway.  Shannon Elisabeth is in it.  I couldn't help myself. :)Still, I wouldn't buy it. It's a mediocre comedy and I don't like to gag when I'm watching movies.Now for the DVD.  First off, The movie is offered in Widescreen and pan'n'scan. It is also offered in two languages, English and French.  Since this is the American release of this movie, wouldn't Spanish be a better additional language than French?The special features are scanty, including only a few theatrical trailers and a filmography.Overall, this DVD release is nothing special. There's no special treats for DVD buyers except for the choice of pan'n'scan or widescreen.  The movie itself is unforgettable, simply for several of its disgusting sequences.

While it was not as over-the-top as American Pie 2, it does rank right up there.  I didn't give it five stars because at times it seems to drag.  All editorial and press reviews aside, this was a very good movie.  At times, I would find myself almost coughing from laughing so hard.Here's a synopsis:  The movie begins with a group of friends who are very disillusioned, they are afraid of commitment and want to remain ""Tomcats"" forever.  They all place money into a high-yield mutual fund in the mid-90's and thinking that it wouldn't be that big of deal leave it there to collect interest.  Flash-forward to present day, the pot is now almost half a million dollars and there are only two unmarried guys left, Kyle (Gary Busey) and Michael (Jerry O'Connell).  While at their friend's wedding in Las Vegas, Michael gets in trouble at the craps table to the tune over 50 thousand dollars.  He hatches a plan to fix  up Kyle (who is filthy rich and pretty much has a different girl every night), with a former bridesmaid at his friend's wedding all those years ago, Natalie (played hilariously by Shannon Elizabeth).  What follows are some of the most disgusting, degrading, and downright depraved scenes that I've seen to date (...).

How? By exulting in the lowest common denominator of male attributes. Imbecilic jokes abound to entertaining the male masses who must make up the majority of this film's viewers. However, below the surface is brilliance, undercovered only by a select group of cinematic geniuses.To the select few, this film is actually a stark examination of depravity: we are asked to observe B-grade actors be pushed increasingly lower into the depths. We explore what is NOT on the screen, such as the awkward human feeling behind the scenes. One can only imagine the director yelling ""Tomcats, Scene 5, Act 4! ACTION!,"" as Horatio Sanz is asked for the fourteenth time to tell a (...) joke.Thus, if you want to see phallus jokes and dispense high-fives, watch the film.
