Buck (the dog) is portrayed by a St Bernard, as he was supposed to be a St Bernard cross.Second, the DVD: The DVD was either transcribed from a pristine copy of the film, or a fair bit of restoration was done. It is VERY clean, free of vertical (film gate) scratches and other artifacts.In all, a pleasure to watch.Clark Gable in Jack London's Call Of The Wild (Region One USA DVD)",4,Excellent film adaptation,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,685,"['review', 'DVD', 'version', '1935', 'Call', 'Wild', 'film', 'starring', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'Loretta', 'Young.First', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'recall', 'book', 'film', 'several', 'areas', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'based', 'excellent', 'performances', 'major', 'players', 'Buck', 'dog', 'portrayed', 'St', 'Bernard', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'St', 'Bernard', 'cross.Second', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'was', 'either', 'transcribed', 'pristine', 'copy', 'film', 'fair', 'bit', 'restoration', 'was', 'done', 'VERY', 'clean', 'free', 'vertical', 'film', 'gate', 'scratches', 'other', 'artifacts.In', 'pleasure', 'watch.Clark', 'Gable', 'Jack', 'London', 'Call', 'Wild', 'Region', 'One', 'USA', 'DVD']",Call of the Wild

It is now common knowledge that Gable and Young fell in love while making this movie.  If you look closely at the love scenes, you can see quite clearly that they were in love.  How could Gable resist the beauty of Young, certainly one of the greatest of Hollywood's beauties.  A classic movie with legendary stars.  Young rejected abortion (Joan Crawford aborted her child with Gable) and ingeniously adopted their daughter, raised her daughter as well as any star can, her name is Judy Lewis.  Loretta finally admitted to having Gable's child before she died of ovarian cancer in her eighties.  I'll give her credit for keeping her baby.  Gable seeminly wanted nothing to do with kids.  Only when he was older did he agree  to a child, but he died before ever seeing his son.  Too bad.  And all the while he had a lovely daughter nearby, but he ignored her.  The film is worth seeing also for Jack Oakie's performance.  He is always likeable, and Reginald Owen as always delivers a fine performance.  Young and Gable made one more movie together in the early fifties, just before Young went into TV and became a mega-TV star; the film is called The Key to the City.  And again, there is definitely chemistry between these two pros, except Young still looks glamorous, but Gable didn't age as well.",5,Gable and Loretta Young:  There is chemistry!,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1364,"['Just', 'watched', 'Call', 'Wild', 'Gable', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'now', 'common', 'knowledge', 'Gable', 'Young', 'fell', 'love', 'making', 'movie', 'look', 'closely', 'love', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'quite', 'clearly', 'were', 'love', 'How', 'could', 'Gable', 'resist', 'beauty', 'Young', 'certainly', 'one', 'greatest', 'Hollywood', 'beauties', 'classic', 'movie', 'legendary', 'stars', 'Young', 'rejected', 'abortion', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'aborted', 'child', 'Gable', 'ingeniously', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'raised', 'daughter', 'as', 'well', 'star', 'can', 'name', 'Judy', 'Lewis', 'Loretta', 'finally', 'admitted', 'having', 'Gable', 'child', 'died', 'ovarian', 'cancer', 'eighties', ""'ll"", 'give', 'credit', 'keeping', 'baby', 'Gable', 'seeminly', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'kids', 'Only', 'when', 'was', 'older', 'did', 'agree', 'child', 'died', 'ever', 'seeing', 'son', 'Too', 'bad', 'while', 'had', 'lovely', 'daughter', 'nearby', 'ignored', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing', 'also', 'Jack', 'Oakie', 'performance', 'always', 'likeable', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'always', 'fine', 'performance', 'Young', 'Gable', 'made', 'one', 'more', 'movie', 'together', 'early', 'fifties', 'just', 'Young', 'went', 'TV', 'became', 'mega-TV', 'star', 'film', 'called', 'Key', 'City', 'again', 'definitely', 'chemistry', 'two', 'pros', 'Young', 'still', 'glamorous', 'Gable', 'did', ""n't"", 'age', 'as', 'well']",Call of the Wild

Hudak,"[3, 3]","While a very good (if not entirely accurate) film adaptation of Jack London's novel and starring Clark Gable in his prime no less, the big draw for the blu-ray is not only its high definition but its inclusion of several scenes cut during its '40s reissue.Some of the cuts were done after being re-evaluated by the Production Code, such as a reference to prostitution.  Other cuts seem to have only been done to shorten the movie so it could be more easily repackaged and more often repeated as the bottom end of a double feature during the mid-1940s, capitalizing on Clark Gable's and Loretta Young's enduring popularity.  This amounted to at least 11 minutes of missing footage out of a feature slightly over 90 minutes long.Further cuts were made once the movie was released for television by NTA, which cut out Jack Oakies' singing because they didn't want to bother with music rights.  The '40s reissue or the NTA print were the only versions available to the general public on television and hove video for decades.  Even the recent DVD used the reissue print.  But by some miracle, it finally dawned on Twentieth Century Fox that the public wanted to see to complete feature originally made by legendary director William Wellman and not some haphazardly edited reissue.

Some Blu-ray discs of older films have been major disappointments, but this transfer--with sharp, steady picture and clear, undistorted sound--couldn't be better.  Yes, it's grainy on a big screen, but I'm glad they didn't sacrifice sharpness to treat it, as others might have done.  There are no other imperfections, and the graininess is forgotten as the story takes hold.And take hold it does, thanks to magnificent production details, and of course, fine acting.  Clark Gable and Loretta Young were never better (apparently the love scenes were real).  Neither was Jack Oakie, who steals every scene he's in, but in a good way.  This should have been his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  In fact, it would have been, if his death scene had not ended up on the cutting room floor (where Jack picked it up and took it home).My only disappointment was that Jack Oakie's death scene was not included as a feature on the disc.  Maybe Fox didn't know it was in the UCLA Film Archives, where it was deposited shortly after I screened it for Jack in the 1970's.  The scene was set around the bad guys' campfire.  Jack has been captured and knows he's in trouble, but launches into a long and touching monologue, after which Reginald Owen--expressionless--pulls his revolver and kills him.  Fade out.  As I said, it was Jack's Oscar scene that was not to be, and in a way I'm glad.  The rest of the film could not have recovered from the tragedy of it, as initial audiences apparently proved, and I much prefer the happy ending that was added.  I mean, you just can't do that to Jack Oakie.Is Call of the Wild faithful to the original story?  Does it matter?

It has the great old actors and Gable does a wonderful job.  I really enjoyed the commentary and history behind the movie.  During the filming Ms. Young charged Gable a dollar for each curse word.  He wound up owing her thousands.  It was filmed under very difficult winter conditions and the actors suffered.  Buck was difficult to handle but bonded with Gable who adopted him, and there is more worthwhile trivia.  This is a great movie to watch on a cold winter night and for those who are interested in classic movies.",4,Another good old classic,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",2014,625,"['movie', 'somewhat', 'based', 'book', 'pure', 'Hollywood', 'still', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'great', 'old', 'actors', 'Gable', 'wonderful', 'job', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'commentary', 'history', 'movie', 'filming', 'Ms.', 'Young', 'charged', 'Gable', 'dollar', 'curse', 'word', 'wound', 'up', 'owing', 'thousands', 'was', 'filmed', 'very', 'difficult', 'winter', 'conditions', 'actors', 'suffered', 'Buck', 'was', 'difficult', 'handle', 'bonded', 'Gable', 'who', 'adopted', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'trivia', 'great', 'movie', 'watch', 'cold', 'winter', 'night', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'classic', 'movies']",Call of the Wild
1043883,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000M6D7SO,Trevor Willsmer,"[20, 21]","Any resemblance to anything written by Jack London in William Wellman's 1935 version of The Call of the Wild is purely coincidental: it's set in the Yukon, and there's a dog called Buck in it who has to pull a thousand pound weight in one scene for a bet, but that's about it. But this Buck is a huge St Bernard and he's only a bit player in a gold rush romp tailored for Clark Gable - but then at the height of his popularity, audiences would probably have burned the theatres to the ground if he'd played second fiddle to a hound. More famous for Gable and co-star Loretta Young emerging from the snowed-in on-location shoot with an illegitimate child, it's an enjoyable enough yarn even in the abridged reissue cut that or decades seemed to be the only version surviving, although it shamefully throws away Reginald Owen's excellent villain, who deserves a much better exit than he gets here.Sadly Fox's original DVD is only the cut (by some 11 minutes) wartime reissue version rather than the original. A decent extras package includes an audio commentary by Darwin Porter; stills gallery, restoration comparison, reissue trailer, and trailers for The Tall Men and Soldier of Fortune. But thankfully Fox's 2013 region-free Blu-ray release finally offers the film in its original 92-minute glory and in a very pleasing transfer. The commentary and reissue trailer have been retained as extras but the stills gallery, restoration comparison and other Gable trailers have been dropped.",3,"Not much to do with Jack London, but still entertaining - cut on DVD but restored on Blu-ray",1241654400,"05 7, 2009",2009,1486,"['resemblance', 'anything', 'written', 'Jack', 'London', 'William', 'Wellman', '1935', 'version', 'Call', 'Wild', 'purely', 'coincidental', 'set', 'Yukon', 'dog', 'called', 'Buck', 'who', 'pull', 'thousand', 'pound', 'weight', 'one', 'scene', 'bet', 'Buck', 'huge', 'St', 'Bernard', 'only', 'bit', 'player', 'gold', 'rush', 'romp', 'tailored', 'Clark', 'Gable', 'then', 'height', 'popularity', 'audiences', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'burned', 'theatres', 'ground', ""'d"", 'played', 'second', 'fiddle', 'hound', 'More', 'famous', 'Gable', 'co-star', 'Loretta', 'Young', 'emerging', 'snowed-in', 'on-location', 'shoot', 'illegitimate', 'child', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'yarn', 'even', 'abridged', 'reissue', 'cut', 'decades', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'version', 'surviving', 'shamefully', 'away', 'Reginald', 'Owen', 'excellent', 'villain', 'who', 'much', 'better', 'exit', 'here.Sadly', 'Fox', 'original', 'DVD', 'only', 'cut', '11', 'minutes', 'wartime', 'reissue', 'version', 'rather', 'original', 'decent', 'extras', 'package', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Darwin', 'Porter', 'stills', 'gallery', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'reissue', 'trailer', 'trailers', 'Tall', 'Men', 'Soldier', 'Fortune', 'thankfully', 'Fox', '2013', 'region-free', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'finally', 'film', 'original', '92-minute', 'glory', 'very', 'pleasing', 'transfer', 'commentary', 'reissue', 'trailer', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'extras', 'stills', 'gallery', 'restoration', 'comparison', 'other', 'Gable', 'trailers', 'have', 'been', 'dropped']",Call of the Wild
