The plot is about a drifter (With a British Accent) who finds himself in some small town in Sounthern California. Later on, a carnival arrives, a carnival of freaks. We later find out that the carnival owner R.B Harker is a vampire.Well, if this film was made in the 1930's or 40's & Lon Chaney starred as the werewolf and Bela Lugosi played the vampire, it would have been a classic today, but unfortunately the film was released at a time were we had a lot of those ""Slasher flicks"" coming out.Overall, Good acting, average special effects.

He becomes friends with them and falls in love with a girl. But it's soon full moon and Ian turns out to be a werewolf. There's another stranger in town as well, freak show owner Harker, who captures Ian to use him in his show.The quality of the Howling sequels is varying. All have that b-movie feeling. Some are good and some are less good. Howling VI has a quite good story and some acting that is above b-movie level. Bruce Payne makes a funny performance as Harker. The plot, however doesn't quite last throughout the entire movie. The worst thing about the movie thoug, is probably the special effects in the transformation scenes. These ridiculous special effects make the general impression not as good as it could, or should, be.However, it is a decent werewolf movie, actually a bit better than I had expected. It's better than Howling III and V, but not as funny as Howling II. It's about as good as the underrated Howling IV. I can recommend it to werewolf movie lovers and those who liked any of the  other Howling-sequels.",3,One of the best Howling sequels.

Yet another subpar, stand alone non-sequel.  Yuck!Ian, cursed with lycanthropy,  wanders into a small town and is only welcomed by a local minister and his underage daughter who really likes him.  During a date with this 17 year old, Ian bumps into a traveling carnival freak show run by a shady Brit named Harker (Bruce Payne; Warlock III: Armageddon, Highlander: Endgame), who seems to be some sort of warlock-vampire.  He is meant to be menacing, but I'm really not feeling it.  VILLAIN-FAIL!This movie really drags.  A lot of effort is made to build up the characters, but I came to this carnival for a horror flick, not a drama--more Killer Klowns from Outer Space than Water for Elephants.  But a drama is more of what I got, and it is hardly carried by this D-list acting troupe.  HORROR-FAIL!This werewolf turns out looking like a member of Twisted Sister during an overdose and shares too much I common with a bad horror vampire to be taken seriously.  He looks like a bearded, long-haired reaper from Blade II or one of those baggy-eyed ghoul-vampires in Subspecies or Dusk 'til Dawn.  Whatever the case, if this wasn't a werewolf movie I 'd probably need someone to explain to me what he was supposed to be.  This make-up is neither good nor creative.  Terrible transformation scene, terrible looking werewolf, awkward canine legs; WEREWOLF-FAIL!Similarly bad is Harker's vampire form make-up, which looks like a blackish purple, hairless demon with a big skull and crazy claws; VAMPIRE-FAIL!  That's right. This werewolf movie was so bad that it managed to shoehorn a &#34;vampire-fail&#34; in with all the other awful.  This monster reminded me of the creeper from Jeepers Creepers crossed with Scott Speedman's half-lycan/half-vampire from Underworld.Needless to say, there is no shortage of stupid in this movie.  But have no fear.  In the end, the freak show's alligator boy recites an incantation he learned from the warlock vampire to turn Ian into a werewolf so that he could defeat the warlock vampire (with a stake to the throat) so that he could live happily ever after with the local minister's underage daughter.Huh!?!",2,"Since The Howling, it seems that this franchise has forever lost its way along with its impact.

274641,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301960203,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","HOWLING VI: THE FREAKS (1991, 102 minutes)A Brit named Ian (Brendan Hughes) drifts into a Southwestern town around the same time as a carnival freak show. He picks up work with a pastor and stays at his house where his cute daughter, Elizabeth (Michele Matheson), takes interest. Harker (Bruce Payne), the darkly man who owns the freak show, may be more than what he appears.This one is too dramatic and slow for those with ADHD and the werewolf's face looks more like a member of Twisted Sister than a werewolf, although the way the beast walks on canine legs is notable. In any case, ""Howling VI"" delivers. In fact, I think it's the best of the sequels, followed by IV and V, although I haven't yet seen 1995's ""The Howling: New Moon Rising [VHS]"" (VII) or 2011's ""The Howling Reborn"" (VIII).What makes ""Howling VI"" stand out is its focus on characters. The casting is excellent and all the characters are well fleshed-out for a 102-minute micro-budget horror flick. For instance, Ian clearly has a dark secret, but it's also obvious that he's a quality soul. Elizabeth is innocent to the ways of the world but she instinctively senses goodness in Ian, as does the ""alligator boy."" Harker, by contrast, possesses a sinister edge despite his great charisma. Speaking of which, Bruce Payne is outstanding here.GRADE: B+",4,Good werewolf vs. evil carnie,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,1319,"['HOWLING', 'VI', 'FREAKS', '1991', '102', 'minutes', 'Brit', 'named', 'Ian', 'Brendan', 'Hughes', 'Southwestern', 'town', 'same', 'time', 'carnival', 'freak', 'show', 'up', 'work', 'pastor', 'stays', 'house', 'where', 'cute', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth', 'Michele', 'Matheson', 'interest', 'Harker', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'darkly', 'man', 'who', 'freak', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'what', 'one', 'too', 'dramatic', 'slow', 'ADHD', 'werewolf', 'face', 'more', 'member', 'Twisted', 'Sister', 'werewolf', 'way', 'beast', 'walks', 'canine', 'legs', 'notable', 'case', 'Howling', 'VI', 'delivers', 'fact', 'think', 'best', 'sequels', 'followed', 'IV', 'V', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', '1995', 'Howling', 'New', 'Moon', 'Rising', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'VII', '2011', 'Howling', 'Reborn', 'VIII', 'Howling', 'VI', 'stand', 'out', 'focus', 'characters', 'casting', 'excellent', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'fleshed-out', '102-minute', 'micro-budget', 'horror', 'flick', 'instance', 'Ian', 'clearly', 'dark', 'secret', 'also', 'obvious', 'quality', 'soul', 'Elizabeth', 'innocent', 'ways', 'world', 'instinctively', 'goodness', 'Ian', 'alligator', 'boy', 'Harker', 'contrast', 'sinister', 'edge', 'great', 'charisma', 'Speaking', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'outstanding', 'here.GRADE', 'B+']",Howling 6 VHS
