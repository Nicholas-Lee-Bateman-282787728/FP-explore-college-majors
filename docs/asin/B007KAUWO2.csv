It was losing to Obama, a charismatic man, who was five times better funded. It needed to do something to turn it around.  So it decided to select a relatively unknown Alaskan  Governor Sarah Palin as McCain's running mate mainly, as she was new, a woman, exciting and had charisma. So the film begins.She proved to be a mixed blessing because politicians need to know today, a lot of the trivia, and she did not, they need to know a lot of important stuff and much of it she did not know either.  She lacked a lot of experience too. She also had a mind of her own and did not take to well instructions. Furthermore, she went through big mood swings. Still I think the film went overboard about all of this as it is not like Obama had that much of all of this either as the film points out, and he beat Hillary, a woman who had it all.I thought the film was well acted.

1532712,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B007KAUWO2,California Dreaming,"[1, 4]","Most people, particularly liberals, like to point their fingers at Sarah Palin and say, ""John McCain lost the election because of her!  She's a dimwit!""  That would obviously be wrong.  I said six months before the election -- much to many of my Republican friends' chagrin, who weren't friendly after my remarks -- ""McCain can't win.  He's too old.""  During an election, people aren't necessarily looking at today; they're looking eight years down the road, as they should.  And voters were correct to think that he wouldn't be capable of leading perhaps earlier than that eight-year point.  Truth be told, if Mr. McCain had chosen Barack Obama as a running mate, Mr. McCain STILL would have lost, as Mr. McCain was such a weak candidate.  Perhaps even against (God forbid) twilight-zone-candidate Joseph Biden in 2008, assuming that it would have been possible for Mr. Biden to run for president.And surely Mr. Biden was never a viable candidate, and never will be.  Much is made in this film about Ms. Palin's lack of foreign policy knowledge.  I remember one point in the movie that Woody Harrelson said something like, ""She doesn't even know why there IS a north and south Korea.""  Well, I don't even know the full history myself, and I surely know more than the average about politics.  But while Ms. Palin should have had understanding of issues such as these, particularly as a vice presidential candidate. . . .At least Ms. Palin seems to understand United States law overall, something that Mr. Biden does not.  For example, all you have to do is read a little about the advice that he gave his wife about using a shotgun.  Now, even children in the US know that you can't shoot a gun through a door, or shoot a gun in the air, some advice that he seems to like throwing around.  I'm not for gun control, but I am for gun control when it comes to Mr. Biden.  Thank God he has the Secret Service to protect him; we surely don't want him carrying a loaded gun around.  (And his behavior during the vice presidential debates was completely unacceptable.  Naturally, laughing at your competition is not a valid argument, kind of like mine until this point, which I am now about to explain.)Now naturally, I am throwing out potentially a red herring myself -- ""Changing the subject"" as it were -- when I discuss Mr. Biden in this review instead of the subject of the film, Ms. Palin.  And perhaps the same goes for Mr. McCain as well, who I personally have no feelings for either way.  I just want to throw out a warning to the left:  as soon as Mr. Biden is out of office -- he might run in 2016 but he has no chance of winning, or even getting his party's support -- the right will have their day.  ""Paybacks are a female dog,"" as they say.  And he will be skewered at that time by more than one documentary.

I frankly would expect a high school graduate to know these basic things about our constitution and law. The film concentrates on her being given special classes on these subjects by persons brought in by McCain's strategists and advisors when they discovered to their horror these huge gaps in her knowledge.  She also had a lot of trouble being tutored in these subjects.  Actually, the people to blame are the campaign advisers.  They just assumed Palin knew the basics but were wholly concerned with how she would appear to voters on the ticket and did not do basic background checks on her. That someone was allowed to run as vice president for this country not knowing anything about the constitution, where countries are located, different systems of government, and so forth was absolutely horrifying.  Julianne Moore does a wonderful job portraying her, even rendering her somewhat symphatetic at times as no one ever asked her about these things before her asking her to run!I know people in these campaigns are focused on the winning but one would think that with the military and nuclear capabilities that the President has that they would have been compelled for their own personal safety to ask some basic questions but no they did not.A word about Ed Harris as McCain: He does an absolutely engaging job of McCain.  I can understand why McCain had his supporters since he is a guy who always wanted to do the right thing and especially serving his country whether as a soldier or as a figure in its government.  If he has a flaw, it is that he was too trusting of his advisers. He trusted them to do all the usual things with Palin that one does to be secure in a political campaign and they didn't do them.This review has nothing to do with Palin's personality, family, her other qualities or her beliefs, just like the film was not concerned with those elements.",5,Ignorance of Law and Government Portrayed at Terrifying Level,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,2097,"['up', 'content', 'read', 'Joe', 'McGuinness', 'book', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'relative', 'education', 'knowledge', 'law', 'government', 'geography', 'other', 'basics', 'what', 'well', 'educated', 'person', 'should', 'know', 'frankly', 'would', 'expect', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'know', 'basic', 'things', 'constitution', 'law', 'film', 'being', 'given', 'special', 'classes', 'subjects', 'persons', 'brought', 'McCain', 'strategists', 'advisors', 'when', 'discovered', 'horror', 'huge', 'gaps', 'knowledge', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'trouble', 'being', 'tutored', 'subjects', 'Actually', 'people', 'blame', 'are', 'campaign', 'advisers', 'just', 'assumed', 'Palin', 'knew', 'basics', 'were', 'wholly', 'concerned', 'how', 'would', 'appear', 'voters', 'ticket', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'basic', 'background', 'checks', 'someone', 'was', 'allowed', 'run', 'vice', 'president', 'country', 'not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'constitution', 'where', 'countries', 'are', 'located', 'different', 'systems', 'government', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'absolutely', 'horrifying', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wonderful', 'job', 'portraying', 'even', 'rendering', 'somewhat', 'symphatetic', 'times', 'one', 'ever', 'asked', 'things', 'asking', 'run', 'know', 'people', 'campaigns', 'are', 'focused', 'winning', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'military', 'nuclear', 'capabilities', 'President', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'compelled', 'own', 'personal', 'safety', 'ask', 'basic', 'questions', 'did', 'not.A', 'word', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'McCain', 'absolutely', 'engaging', 'job', 'McCain', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'McCain', 'had', 'supporters', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'especially', 'serving', 'country', 'soldier', 'figure', 'government', 'flaw', 'was', 'too', 'trusting', 'advisers', 'trusted', 'do', 'usual', 'things', 'Palin', 'one', 'be', 'secure', 'political', 'campaign', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'them.This', 'review', 'nothing', 'do', 'Palin', 'personality', 'family', 'other', 'qualities', 'beliefs', 'just', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'concerned', 'elements']",Game Change

1532716,A30WXSK6N4J0CZ,B007KAUWO2,Christian R. Unger,"[2, 3]","Wow, I don't think I've seen a movie this good in a long time, and really that shouldn't be a surprise, it isn't a block buster cinema release. It isn't the genre that generally attracts work of this caliber and it seems so well nuanced and balanced.Firstly, I don't know how accurate the details are. Wikipedia mentions some responses from characters that feature heavily in the film (in particular Steve Schmidt portrayed superbly by Woody Harrelson) indicating it is pretty on the mark. However so much emphasis seems to be put on the accuracy of Sarah Palin's character portrayal (by Julianne Moore in a truly stellar performance) but that is not what this movie is about. It is about the politics and process of choosing Sarah Palin and the effect this then had. It is immaterial if she took a lot of notes and didn't know this or that. I'd argue that the public is aware of what these bits are derived from but it does not impact what the movie is trying to communicate: In politics you have to make choices and your ideal solution may not be available. This is cast in McCain's choice of running mate for the 2008 election and I think it done extremely well.And I think this movie is made for all audiences, be that left or right leaning (or middle ground), in that it uses Palin as a metaphor that decisions have lives of their own, be that internal (i.e. her family, background, knowledge and character) or external (such as what happens after you choose, here nominate, them). Thus the accuracy of the Palin character is immaterial, and on that subject, it isn't really that she is portrayed negatively, if anything I feel that her efforts were very genuine. I may not agree with conservative politics in the USA (or in Australia for that matter) on every point, but the movie did not portray her as a nut.But enough about Palin, and whether or not she is in this movie. The movie is a drama that compacts several month of campaign work into about two hours. The acting from everyone is superb, that includes everyone, be that minor roles to the top billing. Direction, by Jay Roach, who I had not realized I enjoyed the work of, does a great job. The camera work is clean, the on screen dialog is focused and intense.What makes the movie so good though is how it is put together. Everything is fantastic, with the only detriment being that the last 20 minutes or so just go too quickly. But that is probably the strongest defense I can give to the notion that this is not about Palin, but about the decision and the politics. If this movie had been about her (the person) the movie would have been 15 minutes or more longer and gone into more examples of things she did on record that portray her in a negative light. Instead it mostly forgets about her ... escapades, and instead focuses on where the decision lead.Being based on something incredibly publicized to the point that there was nothing in the movie I hadn't heard in the news in Australia, I'd guess that this movie won't surprise anyone ... SPOILER ALERT: McCain does not win the election. But that's okay, because it gives you an insight into what might have been some of the internal discussions that might have occurred. Incidentally, I would also argue that the accuracy of those is not that material, because the objective of portraying a (real or fictitious) decision is complete. Also, being political the movie certainly had the potential to be a bit dry, but it wasn't. The actors are stellar and keep you interested and the quirkiness of Palin and intensity of Schmidt keep you engaged. This movie truly is a testament to just how fantastic Harrelson and Moore are, but (again) every actor in here does a fantastic job.If you have any interest in politics or enjoy some food of thought, this is a movie you should give a go.",5,"What a well put together movie, great acting, great direction and great message",1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,3809,"['Wow', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'good', 'long', 'time', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'block', 'buster', 'cinema', 'release', ""n't"", 'genre', 'generally', 'work', 'caliber', 'so', 'well', 'nuanced', 'balanced.Firstly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'details', 'are', 'Wikipedia', 'responses', 'characters', 'feature', 'heavily', 'film', 'particular', 'Steve', 'Schmidt', 'portrayed', 'superbly', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'indicating', 'pretty', 'mark', 'However', 'so', 'much', 'emphasis', 'be', 'put', 'accuracy', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'character', 'portrayal', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'truly', 'stellar', 'performance', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'politics', 'process', 'choosing', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'effect', 'then', 'had', 'immaterial', 'took', 'lot', 'notes', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', ""'d"", 'argue', 'public', 'aware', 'what', 'bits', 'are', 'derived', 'not', 'impact', 'what', 'movie', 'trying', 'communicate', 'politics', 'have', 'make', 'choices', 'ideal', 'solution', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'cast', 'McCain', 'choice', 'running', 'mate', '2008', 'election', 'think', 'done', 'extremely', 'well.And', 'think', 'movie', 'made', 'audiences', 'be', 'left', 'right', 'leaning', 'middle', 'ground', 'Palin', 'metaphor', 'decisions', 'have', 'lives', 'own', 'be', 'internal', 'i.e', 'family', 'background', 'knowledge', 'character', 'external', 'such', 'what', 'choose', 'here', 'nominate', 'Thus', 'accuracy', 'Palin', 'character', 'immaterial', 'subject', ""n't"", 'really', 'portrayed', 'negatively', 'anything', 'feel', 'efforts', 'were', 'very', 'genuine', 'may', 'not', 'agree', 'conservative', 'politics', 'USA', 'Australia', 'matter', 'point', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'portray', 'nut.But', 'enough', 'Palin', 'not', 'movie', 'movie', 'drama', 'several', 'month', 'campaign', 'work', 'two', 'hours', 'acting', 'everyone', 'superb', 'everyone', 'be', 'minor', 'roles', 'top', 'billing', 'Direction', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'realized', 'enjoyed', 'work', 'great', 'job', 'camera', 'work', 'clean', 'screen', 'dialog', 'focused', 'movie', 'so', 'good', 'though', 'how', 'put', 'together', 'Everything', 'fantastic', 'only', 'detriment', 'being', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'so', 'just', 'go', 'too', 'quickly', 'probably', 'strongest', 'defense', 'can', 'give', 'notion', 'not', 'Palin', 'decision', 'politics', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'person', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', '15', 'minutes', 'more', 'longer', 'gone', 'more', 'examples', 'things', 'did', 'record', 'negative', 'light', 'Instead', 'mostly', 'escapades', 'instead', 'focuses', 'where', 'decision', 'lead.Being', 'based', 'something', 'incredibly', 'publicized', 'point', 'was', 'nothing', 'movie', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'news', 'Australia', ""'d"", 'guess', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'anyone', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'McCain', 'not', 'win', 'election', 'okay', 'insight', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'internal', 'discussions', 'might', 'have', 'occurred', 'Incidentally', 'would', 'also', 'argue', 'accuracy', 'not', 'material', 'objective', 'portraying', 'real', 'fictitious', 'decision', 'complete', 'Also', 'being', 'political', 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'bit', 'dry', 'was', ""n't"", 'actors', 'are', 'stellar', 'keep', 'interested', 'quirkiness', 'Palin', 'intensity', 'Schmidt', 'keep', 'engaged', 'movie', 'truly', 'testament', 'just', 'how', 'fantastic', 'Harrelson', 'Moore', 'are', 'again', 'actor', 'here', 'fantastic', 'job.If', 'have', 'interest', 'politics', 'enjoy', 'food', 'thought', 'movie', 'should', 'give', 'go']",Game Change

1532718,ACJVGDN8G386P,B007KAUWO2,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[1, 1]","After having seen this film, I do have a bit more respect for Sarah Palin. Not for her political and philosophical views but for the fact she had to endure media coverage which few of us will ever have to sustain. Most of us do not understand what it is like to be ripped to shreds in the media. I do not believe the media has &#34;liberal bias&#34;, but at the same time the media is always looking for a good story. When political celebrities hit the stage at the national level, they become targets of a lot of scrutiny. If a political celebrity from a smaller state becomes involved in a presidential campaign, the media begins dissecting them with a microscope. While this is not necessarily unfair, it can be quite jarring for those not used to it.&#34;Game Change&#34; is one the best film I have seen thus far in 2012, with the exception of &#34;Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy&#34;. &#34;Game Change&#34; takes us behind the curtains of a US presidential campaign, exposing the great wizard as being just very human people trying to do their best to win a presidential election. When John McCain's campaign stagnated towards the end of the summer in 2008, his advisers recommended he needed a &#34;game change&#34;, something new which would ignite interest in their candidate. Their strategy was adding little-known Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to the republican ticket as the vice-presidential nominee. The film explores both the good and not-so-good consequences of this choice. Palin became both an over-night sensation and the target of political journalists who questioned her qualifications.Julian Moore offers the performance of a lifetime as Gov Sarah Palin, a likable &#34;hockey mom&#34; from Alaska who knows how to make great speeches and connect with voters. Her introduction and her speech at the Republican Convention made her the star of the 2008 presidential campaign, only out-shown by Barack Obama. During one scene, McCain's political advisers point out she and Obama are the real stars, excluding McCain and VP Joe Biden from such accolades. At the same time, she was uninformed about a lot of current issues outside of Alaska and became the target of a slew of attacks by political journalists who felt she was ultimately unqualified for the job.I do remember being amused by the caricature of Palin by Tina Fey on several Saturday Night Live sketches, some of their best comedic material in years. In this film, clips of those sketches are shown with Palin and her family members watching. I realized those things can be very hurtful to newcomers and their families if they're not used to having their images displayed simply for entertainment purposes. (To SNL's credit, one of the sketches involve both Palin and Hillary Clinton, which demonstrates they were poking fun at both sides.) Palin had never before been on the national stage, and ridicule does occur from many unforeseen places. When the media began digging into aspects of her personal life which were irrelevant to the campaign itself, particularly concerning her daughter, I did feel the media had gone too far at the time, and that does seem to be the message here.I believe the portrayal was honest, and I don't believe this was meant as a further bashing of Sarah Palin. One of the points of the film was that the national political stage is something different than local politics. An Alaskan evangelical governor who may have won her office because of charm and charisma may not translate as well on the national stage. The press did bring the many skeletons inside Sarah Palin's closet, something most of us would not appreciate. At the same time, that is the national press' job. I want David Gergen, Katie Couric, Mark Shields, David Brooks, Anderson Cooper, John King and Wolf Blitzer to tell us who these people are.

1532721,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B007KAUWO2,Douglas King,"[39, 48]","More than anything, ""Game Change"" is a character study; the character in this case being Sarah Palin. The film portrays her as a complicated, powerful woman who was suddenly thrust into the international political spotlight, then forced to deal with all of the pressure, scrutiny, adoration, criticism, and condemnation that followed.""Game Change"" will probably not please many people, at least from a political point of view. People who despise Sarah Palin will probably think the film is too sympathetic towards her, as she is portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, as a charismatic public figure with the ability to connect with people in a way that few politicians do, and as a person genuinely committed to her Christian faith. At the same time, those who love Sarah Palin will probably think the film portrays her too harshly, showing her as not terribly intelligent, combative, naive, and narcissistic. In a way, the film's greatest strength is also its weakness - it portrays a polarizing figure as a complex, real human being.All character-driven films that succeed have to be cast with excellent actors, and Julianne Moore's exceptional, multi-faceted performance completely anchors the film. Moore's performance was especially critical in this case, because aside from her performance as Palin, there is not much else of interest. Woody Harrelson gives a strong supporting performance as Steve Schmidt, the advisor who first champions Palin as John McCain's running mate and then comes to regret it, but the character is never really fully fleshed out. And Ed Harris, a fine actor, is rather wasted playing John McCain. The character is portrayed as a benevolent, paternal figure, far from the volatile loose cannon he is rumored to be in real life. Palin's family are mostly relegated to being supportive and loving, and the drama of daughter Bristol's pregnancy is mostly glossed over.Aside from being a character study, the film does succeed in making one strong, good point about modern politics: that today's politicians are required to be charismatic and telegenic; more like film stars than intelligent, thoughtful, experienced public servants. Palin was chosen mostly due to her attractiveness, charisma, and her gender (a calculated maneuver to lure female voters). And the film also suggests that President Obama was chosen by the American people for mostly the same reasons.",3,Anchored,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2397,"['More', 'anything', 'Game', 'Change', 'character', 'study', 'character', 'case', 'being', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'film', 'complicated', 'powerful', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'suddenly', 'thrust', 'international', 'political', 'spotlight', 'then', 'forced', 'deal', 'pressure', 'scrutiny', 'adoration', 'criticism', 'condemnation', 'followed', 'Game', 'Change', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'please', 'many', 'people', 'least', 'political', 'point', 'view', 'People', 'who', 'despise', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'will', 'probably', 'think', 'film', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'portrayed', 'devoted', 'mother', 'wife', 'charismatic', 'public', 'figure', 'ability', 'connect', 'people', 'way', 'few', 'politicians', 'do', 'person', 'genuinely', 'committed', 'Christian', 'faith', 'same', 'time', 'who', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'will', 'probably', 'think', 'film', 'too', 'harshly', 'showing', 'not', 'terribly', 'intelligent', 'combative', 'naive', 'narcissistic', 'way', 'film', 'greatest', 'strength', 'also', 'weakness', 'polarizing', 'figure', 'complex', 'real', 'human', 'being.All', 'character-driven', 'films', 'succeed', 'have', 'be', 'cast', 'excellent', 'actors', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'exceptional', 'multi-faceted', 'performance', 'completely', 'film', 'Moore', 'performance', 'was', 'especially', 'critical', 'case', 'aside', 'performance', 'Palin', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'interest', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'strong', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Steve', 'Schmidt', 'advisor', 'who', 'first', 'champions', 'Palin', 'John', 'McCain', 'running', 'mate', 'then', 'regret', 'character', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'fine', 'actor', 'rather', 'wasted', 'playing', 'John', 'McCain', 'character', 'portrayed', 'benevolent', 'paternal', 'figure', 'far', 'volatile', 'loose', 'cannon', 'rumored', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'Palin', 'family', 'are', 'mostly', 'relegated', 'being', 'supportive', 'loving', 'drama', 'daughter', 'Bristol', 'pregnancy', 'mostly', 'glossed', 'over.Aside', 'being', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'succeed', 'making', 'one', 'strong', 'good', 'point', 'modern', 'politics', 'today', 'politicians', 'are', 'required', 'be', 'charismatic', 'telegenic', 'more', 'film', 'stars', 'intelligent', 'thoughtful', 'experienced', 'public', 'servants', 'Palin', 'was', 'chosen', 'mostly', 'due', 'attractiveness', 'charisma', 'gender', 'calculated', 'maneuver', 'lure', 'female', 'voters', 'film', 'also', 'President', 'Obama', 'was', 'chosen', 'American', 'people', 'mostly', 'same', 'reasons']",Game Change

Bush, Mike Huckabee, Paul Wolfowitz, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Rick Perry, Todd Aiken, Richard Mourdock and Sean Hannity.  {Is there any wonder that Bobby Jindal called Republicans ""The party of stupid""?}  In this pantheon of intellectually challenged politicians and pundits, one would think that it would be mighty difficult to surpass them all.  Mirror mirror on the wall....who is the most clueless Republican of them all?  Answer:  Sarah Palin!!GAME CHANGE is a ""behind the scenes"" look at John McCain's political Hail Mary that was ultimately picked-off and returned for a Touchdown by the Obama campaign in 2008.  Needing to gain some traction in an untenable milieu, he felt that he needed a person to energize the conservative base and propel him to victory.  Seemed like a much better idea at the time than it did in retrospect, but his gambit was to choose a woman who was a couple years removed from being mayor of Wasilla, Alaska.This is a very well done film.  Tina Fey is a brilliant comedian and the nation owes her one for her SNL satiric reductio absurdum that she imprinted on the notion of having Sarah Palin as the VP of the United States.  However, Julianne Moore's task was more daunting than Tina Fey's as Moore was not doing a parody of Palin.  The resemblance was remarkable & she nailed Palin's mannerisms;  a few times I had to do a double-take to confirm that it wasn't the former governor of Alaska whom I was watching!Ed Harris is terrific as John McCain & one feels sorry for a war hero who ended up losing control of his own campaign.  The best performance in the film, however, belongs to Woody Harrelson.  Portraying campaign advisor Steve Schmidt, one feels empathy for the man who suggested Palin to be McCain's running mate, only to discover later that he had created a political Frankenstein.  Harrelson has come a long way since playing a dumb bartender on CHEERS.Ultimately, this is what I call an end-of-the-world movie that is structurally similar toBy Dawn's Early Light.  Like DAWN's / LIGHT, this is the story of the world coming right to the edge of apocalypse, only to back away from the precipice at the last possible moment.

1532723,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B007KAUWO2,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[12, 16]","""Game Change"" is not a political cliff hangar if you followed the presidential campaign of 2008 and followed Sarah Palin to the present. What makes it a cliff hangar is that this person could have been a heartbeat away from the presidency, a candidate so ignorant that she could have answered the question without qualm, is she smarter than a 5th grader.The movie begins with Steven Schmidt being asked a question on ""60 Minutes"" by Anderson Cooper, and he goes back in time when John McCain, who is running dead last in the primary, asks him to be his senior campaign strategist. We see McCain, played by Ed Harris, magically capture the Republican Party's nomination for president but well behind Obama in the polls. As his team observes, Obama is a celebrity and they decide they need the same to close the gap with Senator Obama. But who can match his charisma? They find Sarah Palin (played by Julianne Moore) and select her after only five days of vetting. She seems to have everything necessary to appeal to the conservative base, plus she is beautiful and has charisma. And can she ever speak? She dazzles the conventioneers and the campaign team when she steps out on stage and adlibs about a hockey mom being a pit bull only with lipstick.The drama begins when the campaign manager Steve Schmidt, played by Woody Harrelson discovers that her knowledge of world affairs is less than he expected. Her answer to a question from him about relations with the British gives him concern. Harrelson's reaction is almost imperceptible. His eyes narrow slightly like the driver who notices the tiny crack in his windshield and wonders how soon it will take to spread across the rest of the glass. How far does her ignorance extend? When will the press find out?The crack certainly widens as Sarah takes copious notes she cannot remember, like the squirrel that hides nuts but can't remember where he hid them. Her foreign policy education begins with information a first year history student would know. She begins to withdraw after being inundated with information and the absence of family. It explodes with the Couric interview and the recriminations against her and from her.The script portrays John McCain as a man who refuses to take the low road of negative politics, a man who wanted a campaign he could be proud of. The high point of his character is shown again when he takes the microphone from a woman who refers to Obama as an Arab. His only concession to his team is to release the story of Bill Ayers, a former terrorist. This they hand off to Palin who asks the crowds, ""Who is Obama?"" The frenzied throng calls Obama a terrorist, a Muslim, and a foreigner. When McCain asks the same question, we see his facial expression tighten when he gets the same answer. It is clearly not what he wanted to appeal to in the crowd---the hate, the racism, the hostility.As the campaign progresses Palin begin to insist on having things her own way and blame others for her shortcomings. Even the campaign manager finally tells McCain he can no longer control her, that she has gone rogue.What this story revealed was how easy it is to stir a crowd to a frenzy of hate and hostility. Sarah Palin appealed to a crowd that included hate mongers. It reminded me that this country could and can turn the stars and stripes into the jackboot of the swastika, that the greatest threat to our democracy will be the cloaked in the flag of patriotic appeal, and Sarah had the appeal just as surely as Hitler did in Germany.The performances of every actor were powerful. (Pay extra attention to the facial expressions). The screenplay and direction was equally top notch. The talents of all added to the drama and suspense even though we knew the outcome. This is high drama, even for politics.Stay to the end for Steven Schmidt's answer.",5,How We Dodged the Vice Presidential Bullet,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",2013,3830,"['Game', 'Change', 'not', 'political', 'cliff', 'hangar', 'followed', 'presidential', 'campaign', '2008', 'followed', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'present', 'What', 'cliff', 'hangar', 'person', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'heartbeat', 'away', 'presidency', 'candidate', 'so', 'ignorant', 'could', 'have', 'answered', 'question', 'qualm', 'smarter', '5th', 'grader.The', 'movie', 'Steven', 'Schmidt', 'being', 'asked', 'question', '60', 'Minutes', 'Anderson', 'Cooper', 'back', 'time', 'when', 'John', 'McCain', 'who', 'running', 'dead', 'last', 'primary', 'be', 'senior', 'campaign', 'strategist', 'see', 'McCain', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'magically', 'capture', 'Republican', 'Party', 'nomination', 'president', 'well', 'Obama', 'polls', 'team', 'observes', 'Obama', 'celebrity', 'decide', 'need', 'same', 'close', 'gap', 'Senator', 'Obama', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'charisma', 'find', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'select', 'only', 'five', 'days', 'vetting', 'have', 'everything', 'necessary', 'appeal', 'conservative', 'base', 'beautiful', 'charisma', 'can', 'ever', 'speak', 'conventioneers', 'campaign', 'team', 'when', 'out', 'stage', 'adlibs', 'hockey', 'mom', 'being', 'pit', 'bull', 'only', 'lipstick.The', 'drama', 'when', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Steve', 'Schmidt', 'played', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'knowledge', 'world', 'affairs', 'less', 'expected', 'answer', 'question', 'relations', 'British', 'concern', 'Harrelson', 'reaction', 'almost', 'imperceptible', 'eyes', 'narrow', 'slightly', 'driver', 'who', 'tiny', 'crack', 'windshield', 'how', 'soon', 'will', 'take', 'spread', 'rest', 'glass', 'How', 'far', 'ignorance', 'extend', 'When', 'will', 'press', 'find', 'out', 'crack', 'certainly', 'Sarah', 'copious', 'notes', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'squirrel', 'nuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'where', 'hid', 'foreign', 'policy', 'education', 'information', 'first', 'year', 'history', 'student', 'would', 'know', 'withdraw', 'being', 'inundated', 'information', 'absence', 'family', 'Couric', 'interview', 'recriminations', 'her.The', 'script', 'portrays', 'John', 'McCain', 'man', 'who', 'take', 'low', 'road', 'negative', 'politics', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'campaign', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'high', 'point', 'character', 'shown', 'again', 'when', 'microphone', 'woman', 'who', 'Obama', 'Arab', 'only', 'concession', 'team', 'release', 'story', 'Bill', 'Ayers', 'former', 'terrorist', 'hand', 'Palin', 'who', 'crowds', 'Who', 'Obama', 'frenzied', 'throng', 'Obama', 'terrorist', 'Muslim', 'foreigner', 'When', 'McCain', 'same', 'question', 'see', 'facial', 'expression', 'tighten', 'when', 'same', 'answer', 'clearly', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'appeal', 'crowd', '-the', 'hate', 'racism', 'hostility.As', 'campaign', 'Palin', 'begin', 'insist', 'having', 'things', 'own', 'way', 'blame', 'others', 'shortcomings', 'Even', 'campaign', 'manager', 'finally', 'McCain', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'control', 'gone', 'rogue.What', 'story', 'revealed', 'was', 'how', 'easy', 'stir', 'crowd', 'frenzy', 'hate', 'hostility', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'appealed', 'crowd', 'included', 'hate', 'mongers', 'reminded', 'country', 'could', 'can', 'turn', 'stars', 'jackboot', 'swastika', 'greatest', 'threat', 'democracy', 'will', 'be', 'cloaked', 'flag', 'patriotic', 'appeal', 'Sarah', 'had', 'appeal', 'just', 'as', 'surely', 'Hitler', 'did', 'Germany.The', 'performances', 'actor', 'were', 'powerful', 'Pay', 'attention', 'facial', 'expressions', 'screenplay', 'direction', 'was', 'equally', 'top', 'notch', 'talents', 'added', 'drama', 'suspense', 'even', 'knew', 'outcome', 'high', 'drama', 'even', 'politics.Stay', 'end', 'Steven', 'Schmidt', 'answer']",Game Change
1532724,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B007KAUWO2,Enjolras,"[11, 16]","The book Game Change was essentially a gossipy look at the 2008 campaign. HBO wisely took the most compelling story - Sarah Palin's rise - and made it into a TV movie. The result is really compelling. From what I remember from the book, the movie is not blatantly inaccurate and some of the more shocking anecdotes about Palin are verbatim from the book. However, even more interesting is how the movie exposes Palin's flaws while making her a sympathetic character. We see her mean streak and frailties, her harsh treatment of aides and love for family. It's this dichotomy which makes the movie more than an attack or criticism on Palin and transforms it into an engaging character study. Julianne Moore did an amazing job as Palin. I also loved Woody Harrelson as Steve Schmidt, who also comes across well.

1532725,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B007KAUWO2,Erik North,"[7, 11]","The presidential election cycle of 2008 was one of the most, if not the most, explosive of its kind in American history.  Eight years of a neo-conservative administration led by George W. Bush, along with two crippling faraway wars, Hurricane Katrina, and a world economy tottering on the brink of Armageddon, had led America to demand a big change in the way things were done in Washington.  It was the way that change was going to come about, though, that was the issue.  And once Barack Obama, the then-junior U.S. senator from Illinois, and an African-American, had won the Democratic Party's nomination for president, the Republican contender, Arizona senator John McCain, was caught flat-footed...until someone bought up the notion to put as his running mate a total unknown in Alaska governor Sarah Palin.  This was what was documented in the Mark Halperin/John Heilemann book ""Game Change"", which has now become a made-for-cable movie from HBO.The book focused on the GOP side of the 2008 presidential ledger than the Democratic side (even though Obama had his moments against former First Lady Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary), and thus the focus of the film is on McCain, well played by Ed Harris.  He is in a quandary as to how to preserve the ""maverick"" image he had built up for himself in the 22 years he had been representing Arizona in the Senate, while solidifying the ultra-conservative base of his party, which clearly doesn't relish the idea of change coming from an ""unknown"" like Obama.  After having considered several of the guys who challenged him in the GOP primaries, on the advice of his campaign advisor Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson), the choice is made for Palin (Julianne Moore), who at that time had barely any political experience, first being mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, and then having spent barely eighteen months as that state's governor.  Harris is somewhat dubious of Moore, until she shows fierceness to politics that rivals even his own.  But as the film, and the book it is based on, document, their pairing, while it does energize the 2008 campaign, also brings out some of the nastier aspects of rural and semi-rural America, and a whole lot of questions about Moore being properly prepared for the onslaught of questions being lobbed at her by the ""liberal media.""While it may be easy for some to dismiss this as a slap against both McCain himself and the GOP in general by people who clearly lean leftward politically, GAME CHANGE works wonders because these left-leaning actors are able to get into the skin of those on the opposite side of the political aisle and see what those people see to give the whole thing clarity.  Harris, who portrayed Watergate conspirator Howard Hunt in NIXON and NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13, does a solid job of portraying the fiercely independent McCain, while Moore, who was in THE FUGITIVE and THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, does a good turn as Palin, revealing not only the Alaska governor's seeming ""ditsiness"", but also her appeal to the ideologists on the extreme right fringe of the GOP.  Harrelson, who I thought was well overblown as a religious nut in 2009's ""2012"", is equally cagey as Schmidt, whose technical advice was well used by director Jay Roach and screenwriter Danny Strong in the making of the film.Edited with a lot of TV footage from the various campaign stops that McCain made during the campaign, GAME CHANGE vividly depicts not only what the 2008 campaign looked like, but also gives us an idea of what future presidential campaigns will be, with the presence of cable news, Internet blogs, and, most especially, YouTube.  On a more disturbing level, however, it may also show just how much nastier these campaigns are going to get in the future, which makes it not only a compelling item to watch, but also one to be discussed intensely, which is the hallmark of great filmmaking, cable or otherwise.",5,The Year That Politics Really Changed...Possibly For The Worst,1333497600,"04 4, 2012",2012,3938,"['presidential', 'election', 'cycle', '2008', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'not', 'most', 'explosive', 'kind', 'American', 'history', 'Eight', 'years', 'neo-conservative', 'administration', 'led', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'two', 'crippling', 'faraway', 'wars', 'Hurricane', 'Katrina', 'world', 'economy', 'tottering', 'brink', 'Armageddon', 'had', 'led', 'America', 'demand', 'big', 'change', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'Washington', 'was', 'way', 'change', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'about', 'though', 'was', 'issue', 'once', 'Barack', 'Obama', 'then-junior', 'U.S.', 'senator', 'Illinois', 'African-American', 'had', 'won', 'Democratic', 'Party', 'nomination', 'president', 'Republican', 'contender', 'Arizona', 'senator', 'John', 'McCain', 'was', 'caught', 'flat-footed', 'someone', 'bought', 'up', 'notion', 'put', 'running', 'mate', 'total', 'unknown', 'Alaska', 'governor', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'documented', 'Mark', 'Halperin/John', 'Heilemann', 'book', 'Game', 'Change', 'now', 'become', 'made-for-cable', 'movie', 'HBO.The', 'book', 'focused', 'GOP', 'side', '2008', 'presidential', 'ledger', 'Democratic', 'side', 'even', 'Obama', 'had', 'moments', 'former', 'First', 'Lady', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'Democratic', 'primary', 'thus', 'focus', 'film', 'McCain', 'well', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'quandary', 'how', 'preserve', 'maverick', 'image', 'had', 'built', 'up', '22', 'years', 'had', 'been', 'representing', 'Arizona', 'Senate', 'solidifying', 'ultra-conservative', 'base', 'party', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'relish', 'idea', 'change', 'coming', 'unknown', 'Obama', 'having', 'considered', 'several', 'guys', 'who', 'challenged', 'GOP', 'primaries', 'advice', 'campaign', 'advisor', 'Steve', 'Schmidt', 'Woody', 'Harrelson', 'choice', 'made', 'Palin', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'who', 'time', 'had', 'barely', 'political', 'experience', 'first', 'being', 'mayor', 'Wasilla', 'Alaska', 'then', 'having', 'spent', 'barely', 'eighteen', 'months', 'state', 'governor', 'Harris', 'somewhat', 'dubious', 'Moore', 'fierceness', 'politics', 'rivals', 'even', 'own', 'film', 'book', 'based', 'document', 'pairing', 'energize', '2008', 'campaign', 'also', 'out', 'nastier', 'aspects', 'rural', 'semi-rural', 'America', 'whole', 'lot', 'questions', 'Moore', 'being', 'properly', 'prepared', 'onslaught', 'questions', 'being', 'lobbed', 'liberal', 'media', 'may', 'be', 'easy', 'dismiss', 'slap', 'McCain', 'GOP', 'general', 'people', 'who', 'clearly', 'lean', 'leftward', 'politically', 'GAME', 'CHANGE', 'wonders', 'left-leaning', 'actors', 'are', 'able', 'get', 'skin', 'opposite', 'side', 'political', 'aisle', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'see', 'give', 'whole', 'thing', 'clarity', 'Harris', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Watergate', 'conspirator', 'Howard', 'Hunt', 'NIXON', 'NASA', 'flight', 'director', 'Gene', 'Kranz', 'APOLLO', '13', 'solid', 'job', 'portraying', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'McCain', 'Moore', 'who', 'was', 'THE', 'FUGITIVE', 'THE', 'LOST', 'WORLD', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'good', 'turn', 'Palin', 'revealing', 'not', 'only', 'Alaska', 'governor', 'seeming', 'ditsiness', 'also', 'appeal', 'ideologists', 'extreme', 'right', 'fringe', 'GOP', 'Harrelson', 'who', 'thought', 'was', 'well', 'overblown', 'religious', 'nut', '2009', '2012', 'equally', 'cagey', 'Schmidt', 'technical', 'advice', 'was', 'well', 'used', 'director', 'Jay', 'Roach', 'screenwriter', 'Danny', 'Strong', 'making', 'film.Edited', 'lot', 'TV', 'footage', 'various', 'campaign', 'McCain', 'made', 'campaign', 'GAME', 'CHANGE', 'vividly', 'not', 'only', 'what', '2008', 'campaign', 'looked', 'also', 'idea', 'what', 'future', 'presidential', 'campaigns', 'will', 'be', 'presence', 'cable', 'news', 'Internet', 'blogs', 'most', 'especially', 'YouTube', 'more', 'disturbing', 'level', 'however', 'may', 'also', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'nastier', 'campaigns', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'future', 'not', 'only', 'compelling', 'item', 'watch', 'also', 'one', 'be', 'discussed', 'intensely', 'hallmark', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'cable', 'otherwise']",Game Change

To forgive for no...","[4, 8]","Having read the book Game Change closer to the time it was published and not having read many reviews for the HBO movie before viewing, I did not realize that the movie was primarily about John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and how Sarah Palin fit into it.  The book discusses all of the 2008 presidential players, so the movie was a bit of a surprise for me on that front.  That said, it was a riveting surprise - lol!  The story is told through the eyes of two former McCain campaign aides and the story they tell is one of negligence, confusion, unpreparedness and high stress as it pertains to how they picked, vetted, and ultimately threw under the bus former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  The movie is very good so I don't want to give too many details.  What I'll end with is that it made Sarah Palin appear human - not a ridiculous caricature of herself which is often how she comes across via the media.  Personally, I don't like or agree with her politics and believe that the McCain campaign should never have chosen her to be John McCain's vice president in the first place, BUT ... if HBO's Game Change is a true account of how John McCain's final presidential run imploded, I can honestly say that Sarah Palin was thrown into a pool of quicksand with no reasonable or easy way of getting out!Excellent film by HBO, awesome acting by entire cast... 10 stars easily.",5,"The book is better-rounded, but the movie was very good",1340323200,"06 22, 2012",2012,1396,"['Having', 'read', 'book', 'Game', 'Change', 'closer', 'time', 'was', 'published', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'many', 'reviews', 'HBO', 'movie', 'viewing', 'did', 'not', 'realize', 'movie', 'was', 'primarily', 'John', 'McCain', '2008', 'presidential', 'campaign', 'how', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'fit', 'book', '2008', 'presidential', 'players', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'surprise', 'front', 'said', 'was', 'riveting', 'surprise', 'lol', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'two', 'former', 'McCain', 'campaign', 'aides', 'story', 'tell', 'one', 'negligence', 'confusion', 'unpreparedness', 'high', 'stress', 'how', 'picked', 'vetted', 'ultimately', 'threw', 'bus', 'former', 'vice', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'many', 'details', 'What', ""'ll"", 'end', 'made', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'appear', 'human', 'not', 'ridiculous', 'caricature', 'herself', 'often', 'how', 'media', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'agree', 'politics', 'believe', 'McCain', 'campaign', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'chosen', 'be', 'John', 'McCain', 'vice', 'president', 'first', 'place', 'BUT', 'HBO', 'Game', 'Change', 'true', 'account', 'how', 'John', 'McCain', 'final', 'presidential', 'run', 'imploded', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'was', 'thrown', 'pool', 'quicksand', 'reasonable', 'easy', 'way', 'getting', 'out', 'Excellent', 'film', 'HBO', 'awesome', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', '10', 'stars', 'easily']",Game Change

Many viewers delayed watching it because either 1) they are committed Sarah Palin devotees or 2) they are embarrassed that she ever was up for Vice President of the United States.  So it is a surprise that the film seems to be more a biopic, showing all sides of the Alaskan Governor who could see Russia from her house. The film does indeed point out that she was an uninformed, not too bright, misplaced pawn put on the Republican ticket as a gimmick to win some attention away from Barack Obama -  and there she succeeded.  But this film tells us more about our broken electoral/campaign process than most of us realized. The fact that the film is adapted (by Danny Strong) from the journalists' Mark Halperin and John Heilemann book they wrote as insiders to the entire fiasco gives this tragically comedic tale veracity. Jay Roach manages the direction like a spy camera on the wall.John McCain (Ed Harris) is the Republican candidate for President in 2008 and his platform lacks popular support: Barack Obama is clearly a celebrity frontrunner destined to win the election. It is the idea of political strategist Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson in a brilliant performance) to find something to garner public support - and he and his colleague Rick Davis (Peter McNichol) land with the idea of finding a woman candidate to pull the women's votes. They select Alaska Governor Sarah Palin (Julianne Moore in a bravura performance), do a very poor job of screening her qualifications, and suddenly Palin is the running mate; the crowds love her, she speaks to people in small places, and uses all her personal baggage to her advantage.  The problems begin when it becomes obvious that she lacks intelligence, is severely uninformed about foreign policy, the economic crisis, the Federal government, the various wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and terrorism, and in general is a source of embarrassment whenever she opens her mouth in an interview or debate, despite the courageous attempts to coach her by correspondent Nicolle Wallace (Sarah Paulson) and Mark Wallace (Rick Livingston).  She takes notes on cards, trying to learn politics, but continues to make gross statements to the press and the public.  She begins to crumble, giving signs of mental illness, and cannot cope with the criticism and the absence of her family. Ultimately she is given a script to memorize in case she is asked any questions.  She seems to means well but she simply is unfit for office.  The film ends with McCain's defeat and Palin's fury that she can't make a concession speech!The pacing of the action is brisk and the cast handles the delicacy of a biopic with sensitivity. Julianne Moore's sensitive portrayal never stoops to mock but simply shows all sides of the strange personality and mind of Sarah Palin. The film relives a fascinating moment in American history, one that hopefully will never be repeated.

My initial disappointment at the news that HBO would only be creating a 2 hour movie based around Sarah Palin (who only warranted - and received - a few pages in the book) was somewhat tempered by knowing the producers were behind ""Recount"" and the cast included Julianne Moore, Ed Harris and Woody Harrelson in the main roles.  Now I've finally seen it, my feelings are mixed.I wish I could be more glowing about the acting.  Harrelson is almost one-dimensional as Schmidt.  In the circumstances, Schmidt would have remained professional but been a whole lot angrier and even shocked with Palin's lack of knowledge and having to focus so much energy on her presentation.  Harris's McCain was much too ""cool"" for a man who has a reputation for being alternately cold/stilted and hot-tempered.  Finally, although Moore captures some of Palin's essence - from her ability to connect to her audience to her notorious conniving, she wasn't as fluid or confident as Palin.  Where was the word salad - that refuge of unconnected words Palin finds time and time again when she speaks, or the bared-teeth snarkiness?  There were glimpses of the voice but not enough. Moore was trying so hard to perfect the accent she abandoned the character.I will forego some details (makeup, wardrobe, music - all good) but focus on the ones that made headlines.  One was plot, and that was a weak point.  I very much doubt Sarah Palin calls her husband ""First Dude"" in bed or that she winks at people that regularly or peppers her speech with so many colloquialisms - surely a caricature?  I equally doubt McCain's campaign team spent their downtime exchanging Dick Cheney jokes.  I can't believe the whole room would erupt in applause because Palin pronounced Ahmadinejad's name correctly in a debate rehearsal, and key moments of the book - such as Joe Lieberman praying with Palin - were missing.  Indeed, perhaps the most embarrassing mistake Palin made was to accept a phonecall from the Canadian comic team the Masked Avengers - and flirt like a silly schoolgirl with an obviously fake Nicolas Sarkozy.  That incident above all others made Schmidt's blood boil.  And rather than McCain examining the political fall-out of inaction over the financial crisis, when he received a call from Hank Paulsen he - according to the book - handed the phone to Palin who - in typical fashion - chattered for ten minutes about unrelated nonsense.The other key weakness was the transitioning between archive footage and Moore's Palin.

Assuming that it is largely 'true', I can only say that the world luckily escaped a major calamity.An honest man, John McCain, committed a huge blunder by letting his relatively respectable advisers and campaign managers choose a wild gun as candidate for vice president. Seeing that Obama had acquired monumental celebrity status, and was leading strongly in the polls, they jumped on a desperate act of wishful thinking by selecting the awesome SP as running mate. They realized soon enough that some more vetting might have saved much embarrassment. The woman was entirely clueless, but on the other hand a talented campaigner and actress.We  all know what happened next. American voters were not daft enough to vote her into office.She still hangs out there, making noses and doing damage, but essentially her influence seems to be contained within a large radical minority of illiterates.The film does a credible job at reminding us of a period of danger. We can't possibly know if everything happened exactly like this, but the public scenes match my recollections and the unknowable ones look plausible.Julianne Moore is a better SP than SP herself. She clearly outpalins Tina Fey, who was her own kind of genius. Ed Harris is his usual solid professional self as McCain. Woody Harrelson is the man to blame, he plays the genius who picked SP for the job.There are moments in the film when one is tempted to sympathize with the poor woman, when she seems like a hunted victim.There are also moments when one wonders how these losers are going to turn their losing position around.

This docudrama is one of the best portrayals of the world of big-time politics where decisions are often made more on gut instincts rather cool-headed calculation and cunning. The campaign was maverick John McCain's one big opportunity to take the White House on behalf of moderate right-wing interests. The problem here, however, is that times have changed. The GOP based has moved further to the right and a new Democratic star in the person of Obama has arrived on the scene. Lurking in the weeds, ready to ambush the campaign, is a whopper of an economic recession. McCain's strategists told him that victory was only possible if he was prepared to do the unthinkable and find a VP who was both a woman and appealed to the conservative base: a decision that would tie his hands and prove a huge miscalculation. The film focuses on how Palin became that improbable candidate that was expected to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, and why she proved to be such an abysmal failure. Everything covered here is well-documented reconstruction of the story: Palin is seen as an air-head, intellectually lazy, full of herself, dishonest, and indifferent to issues. How could the powers that be get it so wrong? While I am not convinced that Palin's nomination was the main cause of GOP losing the election, it does point to what happens when those in charge don't do their due diligence and ask the right questions in vetting a candidate whose geopolitical knowledge amounted to knowing that Russia was on the other side of the Bering Strait.",4,The Woman Behind the Throne,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,1759,"['Talk', 'pinning', 'political', 'future', 'one', 'roll', 'dice', 'dice', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'Sarah', 'Palin', 'newly-elected', 'governor', 'Alaska', 'partner', 'GOP', 'ticket', '2008', 'US', 'presidential', 'election', 'docudrama', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'world', 'big-time', 'politics', 'where', 'decisions', 'are', 'often', 'made', 'more', 'gut', 'instincts', 'rather', 'cool-headed', 'calculation', 'cunning', 'campaign', 'was', 'maverick', 'John', 'McCain', 'one', 'big', 'opportunity', 'take', 'White', 'House', 'behalf', 'moderate', 'right-wing', 'interests', 'problem', 'here', 'however', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'GOP', 'based', 'moved', 'further', 'right', 'new', 'Democratic', 'star', 'person', 'Obama', 'arrived', 'scene', 'Lurking', 'weeds', 'ready', 'ambush', 'campaign', 'whopper', 'economic', 'recession', 'McCain', 'strategists', 'told', 'victory', 'was', 'only', 'possible', 'was', 'prepared', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'find', 'VP', 'who', 'was', 'woman', 'appealed', 'conservative', 'base', 'decision', 'would', 'tie', 'hands', 'prove', 'huge', 'miscalculation', 'film', 'how', 'Palin', 'became', 'improbable', 'candidate', 'was', 'expected', 'snatch', 'victory', 'jaws', 'defeat', 'why', 'proved', 'be', 'such', 'abysmal', 'failure', 'Everything', 'covered', 'here', 'well-documented', 'reconstruction', 'story', 'Palin', 'seen', 'air-head', 'intellectually', 'lazy', 'full', 'dishonest', 'indifferent', 'issues', 'How', 'could', 'powers', 'be', 'get', 'so', 'wrong', 'am', 'not', 'convinced', 'Palin', 'nomination', 'was', 'main', 'cause', 'GOP', 'losing', 'election', 'point', 'what', 'when', 'charge', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'due', 'diligence', 'ask', 'right', 'questions', 'vetting', 'candidate', 'geopolitical', 'knowledge', 'amounted', 'knowing', 'Russia', 'was', 'other', 'side', 'Bering', 'Strait']",Game Change

The acting is also top notch across the board.What to conclude?

Unfortunately the left who, by the way, claim to be the champions of women, circulated vicious lies about her and her family, ridiculed them, harassed her and her family, burned down her church, jammed up her schedule as governor with numerous, bogus trumped up lawsuits forcing her to resign as governor due to all the time wasted on these lawsuits and sent a liberal media journalist to move in next door to her house to find dirt on her. No dirt was ever found. On top of that Hollywood decided to make a movie portraying her in a negative light. Sounds like she must have been a huge threat to liberals as a young vibrant woman in politics! For this reason the left set out to destroy her with their out right blatant lies as they do in this movie.Any minority who dares to run for office as a conservative is viciously attacked by the left despite the left's portrayal of itself as the champions of minorities. We saw this with Palin and Bachmann. We saw Herman Cain get railroaded with unsubstantiated accusations of infidelity. No proof was ever necessary. We saw the same happen with Clarence Thomas. We are also seeing this with US Rep. Army Col. Allen West. The left is more viciously racist than any conservative ever was if that minority happens to have conservative beliefs.If the lies in this movie were of a liberal candidate, the left would have been up in arms with accusations of sex discrimination against the makers of the film. Just more proof that of leftist hypocrisy.

1532746,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B007KAUWO2,John's Horror Corner,"[7, 10]","Lots of well-quipped laughs.  Love Woody Harrelson.  Love Julianne Moore.  Love this satire!Ed Harris (Man on a Ledge), as always, does a fine job playing a more-likable-than-reality John McCain running in the 2008 presidential election.  I'm not taking a jab at McCain so much as suggesting that the writers and director allowed Ed Harris to be as charismatic as Ed Harris, rather than the rash McCain who described Obama as ""a man who has no major life accomplishments...beating an American hero by double digits...simply sailing on his charisma and star power.""  McCain's campaign team is horrified that ""this guy [Obama] is raising money like he's some sort of a human ATM machine.""  The use of campaign stock footage presents Obama as exactly what we all saw during the campaign while meta-analyzing Harris as McCain.HBO has a strong resume when it comes to non-theatrical films.  Cinema Verite (2011), depicting reality television before there was reality television, captivated viewers leaving them gasping over a time before Snooki and ""The Situation"" were poisoning television with alcoholic tendencies, recreational steroid abuse and Jersey-Italian grammar.  Recount (2008) managed to tickle both humorous and strong political senses.  I'm not suggesting that HBO's filmmakers didn't clearly have a biased (anti-Palin/McCain) agenda in this story, but they did an excellent job of pulling back the curtain and revealing the Great and powerful Oz; the demons mitigating the reality of how our political system functions and the campaign designs architected for their circumvention.  Such vexing reality is painted with lines like ""Lieberman is the right thing to do but the wrong way to win...none of these middle-aged white guys are game changers.""  The solution: ""So find me a woman.""  Perhaps aiming closer to satire than history, this is handled by a Google search complemented by viewing speeches on YouTube--as if the campaign team had no clue about any of these women.Woody Harrelson, wandering somewhat askew of his normally beaten path of sarcastic and histrionic humor, does an exemplary job playing McCain's media-damage-controlling campaign manager, Steve Schmidt.  The humor is all in the situations and Woody delivers them with a straight face that keeps me smiling whenever he has screen time.  He always seems a bit nervous supporting the notion of Palin, a high-risk/high-reward nobody who is ""so outside the box that she'll help [McCain] recapture the Maverick label,"" all the while credibly serving as her Jedi Master offering guidance and tenets of political success.As the moose-hunting, mother-of-five Sarah Palin, Julianne Moore amazes as usual.  While being admonished of the frequent, harsh, unfair examination her private life would undergo she simply smiles glibly, explaining that the Alaska primary was ""pretty rough, too.""  Her speeches' fur-ruffling feminism, considerate attention to small towns and special needs children, and family ideals are tinglingly uplifting--so much, in fact, that we momentarily forget where this movie will inevitably lead us.  A momentary interaction between Palin and a mother of a Down's syndrome child even broke me to tears; in the movie she practically had my vote (early in the movie, anyway).  She starts to win the campaign team's belief that they can actually win...all except for Nicole Wallace (Sarah Paulson), who quietly dreads that what Palin doesn't know will serve as rat poison to the campaign.Not knowing why North Korea and South Korea are different countries or what the FED is, believing the Queen of England to be the head of British government, and that Saddam Hussein attacked the USA on 9/11--Palin requires high school-level history lessons and explanations of recent current events to stand her ground in interviews.  Deeper in the race the expressions of campaign personnel, once awestruck by the podium words of a strong woman, have been distorted to expressions of horror; horror of the child-like ignorance Palin has for even the most basic concepts of the government and history of American history.  Woody Harrelson is eating a grapefruit during a scene in which Palin is being prepped...I've never seen an actor make a grapefruit look so painful to eat.  These scenes are soul-crushing and it just gets worse as we approach Palin's breakdown.I endorse this political satire very much and would like to close with a few not-yet-mentioned favorite quotes:""It's not that she doesn't know the answer.  It's that she clearly doesn't understand the question.""""She's a great actress, right?  Why don't we just give her some lines.""Debacle after debacle... ""If John McCain wins, then this woman will be one 72-year old man's heartbeat away from being the president of the United States.""",4,Lots of well-quipped laughs.  Love Woody Harrelson.

1532748,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B007KAUWO2,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 13]","This latest high-quality HBO film covers the 2008 Presidential election where Arizona Senator John McCain chose Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. The film is based on a lengthier book entitled Game Change: Obama and the Clintons, McCain and Palin, and the Race of a Lifetime by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, but this film focuses specifically on the McCain and Palin aspect of it, with the two being portrayed here by Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. Politics are a touchy subject, particularly in the current political climate and in reviewing Game Change I intend to limit my review to the film itself. My own political beliefs have no effect on the overall quality of the film and I don't follow politics religiously anyway. The familiarity I do have is not extensive enough to allow me to point out every fictional and factual scene in the film on a whim, but I guarantee this film will stir up controversy. McCain and Palin have already condemned it. While there's certainly material here to offend people, it's hard to argue what a well-acted and well-put together film this is.The story starts in August of 2007 with John McCain enlisting Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson) to work on his campaign as the Senior Campaign Strategist. Moving ahead, McCain wins the Republican nomination and wants Joe Lieberman as his running mate. His campaign rejects this idea, noting Barack Obama's surging popularity and the need for McCain's campaign to find a ""game changer,"" someone who will appeal to both conservatives and women. The campaign thinks they've struck gold when they offer the job to Sarah Palin, who is officially selected as McCain's running mate after an extraordinarily brief vetting process. While her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention is well-received, the campaign comes under attack. Palin's knowledge of foreign policy is nearly nonexistent and her knowledge of domestic policy doesn't fare much better. Her disastrous Katie Couric interview (which is covered in-depth) makes everyone involved think they may have been too hasty with their selection.  As Palin's following grows, she becomes increasingly harder to control...Ultimately, according to the film, losing the McCain campaign the election.The impression the film gives about Palin is that she's a sympathetic simpleton who was exploited by her own party for political gain. Still, if I was her, I wouldn't want to watch this film. If you were conscious during the 2008 election, you probably saw many of the things portrayed here on the news; regardless, I'm sure there's some bias. It's hard to believe Palin could be this incompetent, but the film does portray her as a victim in a sympathetic light.  Whether you feel it's fair (Steve Schmidt claims it's truthful) or biased, it can't be argued that the film humanizes John McCain and Sarah Palin.The performances will be a major point of discussion. Ed Harris has more of a supporting role as McCain, but he portrays him as a man of honor, principled and driven, with some good, admirable ideas of how to run his campaign. McCain is made likable and sympathetic. It's hard not to be fond of him once the film has ended. Harris' performance would not be nearly as effective without the work of the makeup artists involved. They did a stunning job making Harris look the part and it's easy to forget you're watching him.  Harrelson essentially plays the lead role, portraying the mounting frustration and stress of trying to keep the campaign afloat. The front-and-center performance comes from Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin, in a role that will probably win her an Emmy.This performance is remarkable. Not only does Moore personify Palin physically, she captures the speech, the facial expressions; the whole essence. It's not a caricature or an impersonation, it's an embodiment. Even more remarkable is that it's so easy to let this performance fall into parody, but Moore has total control over the tone. She also succeeds in making Palin sympathetic, even while portraying her as a dedicated mother, stubborn, controlling, driven, and egomaniacal. Those who watch the film with an open mind will have a higher opinion of McCain than Palin, but it's still an enlightening glimpse of the woman.Besides any perceived bias, there are some light jabs that will piss off Conservatives but this film should be embraced for how effectively and astonishingly it makes you empathize with McCain and Palin. This is especially odd when you consider the film is helmed by Jay Roach, director of Meet the Parents and the Austin Powers series. Tackling the complex personalities of the people involved draws you into the story and despite much of it being fresh in the American viewer's mind; it flies by in its suspenseful two-hour running time. Since the film is about recent events, it does incorporate bits of real life. There's some camera trickery that is sometimes too brave (it's clearly not Joe Biden standing across from Palin at the Vice Presidential debate), but for the most part it's fluid and effective.With McCain's campaign a thing of the past, the film doesn't seem to make any political statement, although McCain's parting words to Palin certainly reflect the current state of affairs in the GOP. Game Change can't be strictly factual (no two-hour film could be really), but it is great, intellectually stimulating entertainment. It may even be inspiring enough to make you want to conduct your own research.",5,Fascinating and Extraordinarily Well-Acted,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,5480,"['latest', 'high-quality', 'HBO',

1532755,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007KAUWO2,Mark Turner,"[4, 9]","How you view the movie GAME CHANGE will depend quite a bit on how you feel politically. There is no way around it. If you are liberal then you'll find the movie does a great job of pointing out how terrible a person Sarah Palin was. If you're a conservative you'll find that the movie is little more than a hatchet job. But if you're like I feel most people are, sort of in the middle of those two camps, you'll see both aspects of that in this film.GAME CHANGE is about the elections of 2008 when Barak Obama came out of nowhere and used the flames of popularity to win the White House. His campaign was well run and people seemed to adore him much to the consternation of competitor John McCain (Ed Harris) and his staff. The movie shows them discussing how to take on Obama and win votes away from him and that results in a choice that felt to many like it came out of nowhere, the choice of Sarah Palin (Julianne Moore).But it wasn't out of nowhere. As the film shows it was a savvy move to attract voters who were viewing McCain as nothing more than the same old ancient white man who runs the country. Choosing Palin was a risky choice but it got the press and the public interested. Chief strategist Steve Schmidt (Woody Harrelson) is tremendously pleased with his choice once the numbers begin coming in and it looks as if McCain might actually have a chance to win.Up to this point the movie seems pretty even handed and displays a side of both McCain and Palin that seem like normal people who have moved on to positions of power. Neither seems evil or out to do damage and both love their country and what to do what's right. That all changes as the movie then tries to show Palin as perhaps the most stupid person on the face of the Earth.As the strategists try to prep her for interviews and to make speeches, Palin appears to know absolutely nothing. Their depiction of her almost nears the point of where you wonder if she has the ability to even know how to tie her own shoes. Not only that but the film shows the pressure of having to perform, having to suddenly be thrust before the intense scrutiny of the press and all without the election team having done the necessary background checks they were supposed to because they thought someone else had done it.The change in the film also shows in how they felt voters changed as well. When Palin is first announced the crowds go wild and money begins coming in to help support McCain. When she fails at several interviews suddenly the film tries to lay the blame of the fall of McCain on Palin's shoulders. This seemed a bit odd to me since I recall that campaign and how crowds continued to flock to see Palin up till the last minute and continue to do so even today.As the film progresses we see Sarah Palin changing from the soccer mom governor of Alaska to a power hungry witch who thinks she knows more than those trying to help her. I have little doubt that there is some truth in that because the saying that power corrupts. I also believe that the pressure must have been tremendous on Palin who was suddenly thrust into the spotlight. Anyone might think they are prepared for that but the intense scrutiny that the press brought down was unlike any seen in recent times.So how is the movie? Interesting from start to finish. It does show a lot of what goes on behind the scenes during an election, perhaps not as well as THE WAR ROOM documentary about Bill Clinton's election, but it gives viewers a look at what happens when the doors are closed off to the press. The performances are what surprised me. Ed Harris does a fantastic job as McCain making him someone that maybe more people would have voted for if he'd come off this good. Harrelson also does a great job as a man who was to be the architect behind a successful for the Presidency who sees it all fall apart.After all the acclaim and awards Moore won for her performance here I was stunned to see how weak it truly was. I felt more like I was watching Tina Fey do her impression of Palin than I was seeing an actor perform a role. She has the voice and look down but where was that side of Palin that we didn't see before cameras? According to this film and Moore's performance there was nothing the least bit sympathetic about Palin. She comes off as naive and then a total witch with nothing in between. She's portrayed as being so incredibly stupid as to not know the simplest of things taught in junior high civics classes. Having been the daughter of a teacher, a news anchor, a mayor and a governor, I found it incredibly disingenuous for her to be displayed this way. It felt more like a cheap shot than a does of reality.As I said from the start, your own belief system will decide how you feel about this movie. If you love Palin you'll be angry and if you hate her you'll dance in the streets. I didn't go to either extreme. I just felt like a great topic for a movie was squandered that so much more could have been made of. Then again Hollywood seems determined to portray any conservative character as evil and bad so I shouldn't have been surprised. It would be nice to see an even handed portrayal of both liberals and conservatives show up but I won't hold my breath waiting.",3,REAL OR NOT?,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,5231,"['How', 'view',

She really seems to actually be Sarah Palin in the movie including the accent she adapted to sound like Sarah Palin.I am not a Sarah Palin fan but Moore's balanced portrayal left me feeling much more sympathy for what Palin and her family went through in her deciding to accept the nomination for Vice President than I had previously felt.While we all know Palin has made a lot of mistakes and has showed her basic ignorance about a lot of issues on national TV, I never really thought about what humiliating herself like that made her feel. Yes, she seems strong as nails and confident in public but in the movie some of this is depicted as bravado and I think that anybody ridiculed the way she was ridiculed had to have some human reactions as a result...e.g. depression, self doubt and anger.I think that, even though I disagree with her political position, I would respect Palin more if she could just admit that she is wrong or misinformed about certain things. The fact that she defends her mistakes in the light of them being blatantly false makes me think she would be dangerous in a powerful position and this movie supports my opinion in this area.As usual Ed Harris gives a great performance but Woody Harrelson gives one of the best performances that I have ever seen him give and that is saying a lot. I hope he won an Emmy like Moore did for this movie.One final thing. When this film came out there was considerable criticism that it was not an accurate account of McCain's choice to make Palin his running mate or a fair portrayal of Sarah Palin.I disagree with that criticism and my stance was formed by many other sources besides the book of the same name on which this movie is based.

Tony Knowles, it shows Palin at her best and worst.She was chosen because she is an attractive, courageous populist, who is ambitious, talented, but who's knowledge of basic American history is worse than that of an 8th grader. It shows as we saw in the Curric and Charlie Gibson interviews in real life, that she was asleep in college classes. You don't have to know the major leaders of Pakistan, Irag, or Syria, to be a Gov. of Ak, as a person who could have been a heartbeat away from the leader of the free world you do.If you hate Palin, than you will cheer this film, if you love her than you will feel the McCain staff did a hatchet job on her.

That isn't to say that Ms. Moore's performance wasn't steller and deserving of praise, but Mr. Harris' performance gave us some serious prospective on John McCain's character, expanding it far beyond what the media has often shown us.

The performances by Julianne Moore as Palin; Ed Harris, as McCain; and Woody Harrelson as Senior Campaign Strategist, Steve Schmidt, are superb, with the edge going to Moore...her portrayal of Palin (at least physically) is even more dead-on than Tina Fey's.

They were facing a very tough race.It is a different environment than the 1984 campaign, where Geraldine Ferraro made history as the first ever candidate nominated by a major political party. But it was 'safe' for the GOP to now nominate a woman VP candidate. There would be no incumbent president in the Oval Office, women served as Attorney General, National Security Adviser, and Secretaries of State. They weren't 'breaking bariers'. They were trying to win voters.Observing rail-close Democratic primary competition between front-runners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, McCain's campaign believed in their strategy. Party officials obviously believed that women upset/frustrated about Clinton not obtaining the Democratic presidential nomination would defect over to the GOP ticket.Rushing to get these votes, the GOP team did forget to carefully screen prospective candidates.So instead of picking the experienced Olympia Snowe or Susan Collins (among other GOP moderates), they ended up with Sarah Palin. This little-known Alaska Governor was a favirote among social and economic conservatives. She was not however, prepared for harsh national spotlight.Teenage daughter Bristol was not following the party abstinence only platform.  And Sarah Palin lacked basic domestic and foreign policy knowledge. Great at delivering 'sound-bite' quotes, she lacked the intellectual depth expected of federal executive officials.If she was supposed to represent the 'modern woman' GOP party officials apparently still did not like or trust us. McCain was portrayed as ill-prepared and dangerous if inside the Oval Office. His polling suffered because of the trade off through nominating Palin. She was the best campaign ad which the DNC could have concocted. Election exit polls found only 39 percent of voters believed Palin was ready to lead the country in the event of a crisis when McCain was unavailable. Gaffes about Revere and Russia expertly muted Obama's 'inexperience'.The actors and script writers did a hauntingly realistic job. It actually looks like their real-life persona. It is however uncomfortable because there are people who actually believed that Sarah Palin was competent and qualified. However few in number today, these people will follow her anywhere.

Pailin is shown in this film to be a woman thrown into the national spotlight without any preparation nor vetting by her own party. She's shown to have little historical knowledge which we know to be true from the many interviews and statements she made during and after the Presidential campaign. She's portrayed as a devoted mother and wife, charismatic yet provincial, narcissistic and emotionally immature. She's represented as a political fighter who suffers from intellectual atrophy, the polar opposite from the traditionally conservative McCain.Moore's performance was outstanding and she nailed many of Pailin's mannerisms and speech. The script if anything attempts to redeem the negative perception of traditional Conservatives who mixed themselves with radical right wingers which lead to the highjacking of their own party.

1532781,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B007KAUWO2,Thomas Glebe,"[10, 15]","First of all, this is a review of the actual movie/film as originally broadcast on HBO.  Second, it is not meant to be a comment on purchased DVD extras or such, or delivery problems and such, but finally, I will base this review solely on this film's worth as great cinema (IMHO), and despite my own general political views.  Anyone who wishes to learn more of my own political and social views generally, should read my various reviews and Listmania list comments.  Basically, I am left of ""center,"" whatever that means, these days.This is a review of the movie and content itself however, and I have watched it several times on HBO on-demand, which might say a bit about how much I liked, and love this.  Regardless of one's political leanings, I think all on all sides, can learn a lot from this movie.  It is very well done by director Jay Roach, with solid references and great performances all over the place.  Special kudos to Julianne Moore, who is the whole show here, and boy, did/does she nail Sarah Palin or what?  This is an obvious Emmy in her name.  Despite the naysayers FoxNewz, radical right, etc., this truly portrays a quite ""fair and balanced"" view on Sarah Palin and the presidential race of 2008.  Other cast putting in great performances include Woody Harrelson and Ed Harris.This movie is one of the reasons why so many still pay for HBO.  Once in awhile, they will produce and show, something as good as this.  And sadly, for those without HBO or any ""subscription"" to such, this would proably go unknown.  But I'd like to spread the word.  This is a great film, and I hope both left-leaning and right-leaning, really get a chance to watch this, without any expectations or politically self serving motives. To anyone considering a buy here though, you should see this film at least once, uncut, before you buy.  Conservatives and liberals will see what they want to here, but overall, I think it presents a pretty accurate and objective picture of Sarah Palin's VP run, and I will never understand some strong objections to what is presented here, either by Palin herself, or the Republican party, or the extreme right-wing phone it in, ""born agains,"" and just about anyone given air time on Fox Newz.  Not to say anything about the MSNBC wing-nuts.  Overall, for myself, what's all the fuss?  If anything, this actually creates a sympathy for Sarah.  Bottom line is she was out of her league, and as much blame directed at her, is equaled by the persons shown who did a lousy job of vetting and presenting her.If you see it and like it, buy, because I think this will go down as one of the most honest, comprehensive, ""political"" movies of all time.  It compares for me with previous ""political"" films like ""The Candidate,"" ""Seven Days in May,"" ""Advise and Consent,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" and many others.  I think as time goes by, more positive reviews will come this film's way than not.  But all of this is just my own opinion.The movie is, when all is said and done, actually kind of a positive take on Palin, and creates much sympathy for the woman, and for John McCain.  It makes its main point however, without flaw.  And that is, that Sarah Palin not only was never qualified for the office she ran for (one heartbeat away from the presidency), but also that she was surrounded from the beginning with too many ""support staff"" and DC insiders and image-makers, who only played a game with her and tried to make her into something she never was, nor is still to this day.I find it strange that most Palin supporters (no matter what reality was and is), have put this film down so much, and in many cases, have completely shunned it all, just like Sarah Palin has done herself.  This is so wonderfully well-done, from a film technique aspect alone, and truly so ""fair and balanced"" about Palin, that strong objections to this content ring hollow at best, among both the liberal and conservative elements in the two major parties, and the mass-media alike.For those looking for a validation of their ""liberal"" views, they will find affirmation here, but it is a false one and doesn't dig deeper.  I am no Sarah Palin fan, nor will I ever be, but even I felt a new kind of semi-respect for her after watching this many times.  It is obvious she was the wrong choice for the office she ran for, but one can only wonder what she might've been, and who might've been president, had her ""handlers"" been anything approaching honest human beings. Sure, she was simply unready for all of this, but I am left with the feeling that if Sarah Palin had just gotten out of the way of her own shortcomings and ego, as well as those who chose her and pushed her onto the public without much regard for her as a person, things could've been a lot different.Overall, regardless of one's personal political ideas and ideals, this is a first class political film as well as a continually absorbing and entertaining movie.  I only wish it could've been expanded into a several hour mini-series, cause what IS shown, is absolutely, damn interesting, every moment of it.

During the historic election of 2008 John McCain was trailing Barack Obama and was in danger of falling farther behind. He was losing all demographics and with the Republican convention approaching he needed a shot of life to his campaign. He got it in his choice for running mate. Sarah Palin gave them the jolt they wanted, but this movie shows the cost of that bump. I am a huge political junkie and was looking forward to this movie. I will start by saying the the acting is incredible. Ed Harris looks and sounds like John McCain and Julianne Moore pulls off the impossible, she may be a better Palin then Tina Fey. The actual movie though is just OK to me. I liked it and could really go either way with Palin but it felt to me like almost one long attack on her. Could have just been me but the movie portrayed her as almost bi-polar and dumber then we think she is (which is hard to do). I recommend this and I did enjoy it but I'm interested to see how much of this is accurate and how much is ""doctored"" for dramatic license.

1532783,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B007KAUWO2,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[81, 97]","Released almost a year to the day after Barack Obama took his place as President of the United States, Game Change landed into the political soccer field with a wallop, and quickly became the talk of the DC insider circuit. Written by Mark Halperin and John Heileman, the gossipy tell-all proved to be the final escape hatch for a lot of supposed experts who saw their careers waylaid by piss poor decisions, leading to a level of backstabbing and leaked information that was virtually unprecedented. It made for an entertaining read, like skimming through the National Enquirer while in a check-out line. And much like those scandalous rags with their silly celebrity headlines, most of what was inside turned out to be true, despite all the protestations by those the book would highlight.Game Change was pretty even handed in it's dirt digging, exposing some ugly facts about Hilary Clinton's 2008 campaign as well as the bedroom shenanigans of John Edwards. For HBO's new film adaptation of the book, from the same guys who gave us the excellent Recount a few years ago, the focus is squarely on the Republican side of the ticket, and the roller coaster that was John McCain(Ed Harris) and his polarizing running mate, Sarah Palin(Julianne Moore).Consider the film less of a biopic and more of a fact finding mission, as writer Danny Strong attempts to uncover how a dedicated war hero with a campaign proudly boasting ""Country First"" could nominate someone as hopeless as Palin to be within a breath of the Presidency. The obvious answer is desperation, but there's more to it than that.  It takes a concerted and sustained level of willful ignorance for something like this to happen, and it starts right at the top. Centering mostly on McCain's senior adviser, Steve Schmidt(Woody Harrelson), who first put forth the idea of selecting the popular Alaskan Governor as a means of rallying the flagging conservative base, the campaign's highs and lows are seen mostly through his bloodshot eyes. Palin's nomination would not only give the base the red meat it so desired, steal the thunder from the mega popular Obama machine, and possibly even rally the Clinton supporters to their side. The campaign needed a game changer, and Palin was it. She was the world's most charismatic lump of clay, ready to be shaped. Or so they thought. She was new to the national stage, however, and was instantly a liability in terms of experience. Could McCain give up his principles and select someone he knows isn't ready to be President, all just for the sake of a victory? Would he be ""Country First"" when it really mattered?For those who follow the political grind on a daily basis, there's little new to learn about who Sarah Palin was back then. She was a simple, determined mother who got caught up in the glitz of the global stage. When she accepts the vice-presidential nomination, her calm and reserve is unbelievable, shocking everyone in McCain's camp. However, it isn't long before they realize just how big of a mistake they've made, and all the attempts to pull a Pygmalion on her are going to be utter failures. The film shows her disastrous, often mocked interviews with Charlie Gibson(although the ""Bush Doctrine"" question is left out) and Katie Couric, where Palin is stumped by a simple question of what newspapers she reads. The constant criticism forces her into a mental breakdown of sorts, and any attempt to help her is met with resistance. Uh oh, time to start goin' rogue!The film is especially fascinated with two defining character arcs. One is Palin's transformation from an unknown hockey mom into an egotistical, perpetual victim who terrorized her staff, leading to some claiming she was mentally unstable. The other is that of Schmidt, who comes to see how the decision he made in choosing her was the most awful mistake of his career, that didn't just threaten McCain's campaign, but also could ruin everyone's reputation forever. Oh, and it might damage the country's standing in the world, too. Julianne Moore is going to get all the attention for her performance as Palin, and she darn well deserves it. After so many Palin imitations, not the least of which by Tina Fey, playing her in any realistic manner is tough, but Moore nails her folksy manner and Eddie Haskell charm perfectly. If this was a feature film, Moore would be a shoe-in for Best Actress right now. Harrelson shouldn't be overlooked, either. His Steve Schmidt(aka the ""Schmidt Head) bears little resemblance to the real man, now an excellent MSNBC contributor. The only thing they have in common is the bald head. Harrelson creates his own version of Schmidt, a man conflicted by his pledge to do everything to win and his desire to maintain some dignity.Few people come out of this smelling like a rose, although it's not entirely a hit piece. Palin does come off as someone completely overwhelmed by the experience, even if she entered it for all the right reasons.  There are some genuinely effective moments that portray her in a positive light, or at the very least show why she resonated with so many people. One of those scenes comes fairly early on, as she's speaking about her disable son, Trig. To have someone of Palin's stature have a personal stake in advocating for children of special needs struck home with a lot of people. As she began to lose more of herself to the needs of the campaign, Palin lost that connection and was consumed by the need to say and do anything to win. It became all about her need for more of the spotlight. Ultimately she comes off as nasty, mean-spirited, conniving, and worst of all.....dumb.Jay Roach and Danny Strong do their usual excellent job navigating the political waters with a mix of humor and darkness, as they did with Recount. The 2008 campaign is arguably the most fascinating in this country's history, and the film only shows us one small sliver of it. As well as it shows the dramatic surge of enthusiasm Palin provides to Republicans, we never get to see the equal amounts of fear she inspired in the Democratic base. In fact, we only see Barack Obama and Joe Biden in stock footage. HBO may be looking at the first leg of a possible trilogy here, with the next showing the combative primary between Hilary Clinton and Obama. Then...if we're all lucky, maybe we'll get to see Obama's historic Presidential campaign from his perspective?",4,Review: 'Game Change',1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,6395,"['Released', 'almost',
