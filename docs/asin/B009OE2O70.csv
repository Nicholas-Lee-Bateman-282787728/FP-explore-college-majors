1601020,A1CEWA3OSCBSVC,B009OE2O70,A Music Fan,"[4, 4]","I discovered this mini-series after returning from visiting Mount Vernon and looking up George Washington related items on Amazon. I initially held off on my purchase until I could confirm that the earlier version glitches were resolved. I found that the scenes previous reviewers described as missing (1765 to 1775) are in the version I received. I also believe the original run times included commercials. My set Part I clocked in at 396 minutes and Part II at 197 minutes.Now for the series itself. One of the best I've seen! Most video releases out there are documentaries about GW and not much in the way of a movie/series. I found this series very entertaining and informative. Both the ups and downs of his life are presented. Much of GW's life is captured here, but I found the parts about the Revolutionary War and his presidency the most fascinating. Barry Bostwick's portrayal was excellent. I thought he did a great job. I also found Patty Duke's portrayal of Mrs. GW very well done.I highly recommend this set. A great story of GW and the founding of this great nation (as related to GW). I hope someday we may see some more mini-series of the founding of our country and the major players (like HBO's John Adams).",5,Well Done Mini-Series!,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,1227,"['discovered', 'mini-series', 'returning', 'visiting', 'Mount', 'Vernon', 'looking', 'up', 'George', 'Washington', 'related', 'items', 'Amazon', 'initially', 'held', 'off', 'purchase', 'could', 'confirm', 'earlier', 'version', 'glitches', 'were', 'resolved', 'found', 'scenes', 'previous', 'reviewers', 'described', 'missing', '1765', '1775', 'are', 'version', 'received', 'also', 'believe', 'original', 'run', 'times', 'included', 'commercials', 'set', 'Part', 'clocked', '396', 'minutes', 'Part', 'II', '197', 'minutes.Now', 'series', 'One', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Most', 'video', 'out', 'are', 'documentaries', 'GW', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'movie/series', 'found', 'series', 'very', 'entertaining', 'informative', 'ups', 'downs', 'life', 'are', 'presented', 'Much', 'GW', 'life', 'captured', 'here', 'found', 'parts', 'Revolutionary', 'War', 'presidency', 'most', 'fascinating', 'Barry', 'Bostwick', 'portrayal', 'was', 'excellent', 'thought', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'also', 'found', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'portrayal', 'Mrs.', 'GW', 'very', 'well', 'done.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'set', 'great', 'story', 'GW', 'founding', 'great', 'nation', 'related', 'GW', 'hope', 'someday', 'may', 'see', 'more', 'mini-series', 'founding', 'country', 'major', 'players', 'HBO', 'John', 'Adams']",George Washington Mini: Series

I admit in 1984 when this was first shown on television, I was not in the country so I missed it. I did become aware of the series a few years later. One night, when I was sick and missed work and it was rebroadcast but I only saw one episode. However, I did not see the complete series until the mid 90's when either TLC or the History Channel showed it for the 4th of July. I collected the VHS tapes. I do not recall anything different between then and watching the DVD's just now.What I saw on this was a very good mini-series about George Washington. What I received was the original "" George Washington,"" mini series and "" George Washington: Forging of a Nation.""  Of the two the first is the best, it deals with Washington's life from a young age until the end of the Revolutionary War. The second mini-series deals with Washington's time as president.Both series are based on James Thomas Flexner's biography on Washington. I can only say if you love the Revolutionary War period of American history, buy the mini-series. It stays pretty close to Flexner's biography. It is also a good way to be introduced to George Washington. I remember when I was in grade school. Washington never excited me. Franklin or Revere was the interesting ones from the Revolution to me then. It was only as I became older did I really become really aware of Washington and just how important he truly was.Note, if this DVD release is indeed missing portions return it but I think it is complete.

I was still in the Army at Fort Belvoir Virginia (where they filmed some of the battles scenes) at the time.  Some of my friends were actually in the movie.  General Washington is a personal hero of mine so I was excited to see his story finally put on TV.  Some people may be put off by the length of the series but that is one of the reasons I loved it as it covers virtually Washington's entire life from childhood to him leaving the Presidency.  It was filmed at all of the historic sites associated with Washington and the battle scenes are very accurate to the period.  You can almost smell the powder.Barry Bostwick's portrayal is excellent and I think captures Washington's demeanor and character.  Highly recommened both for its entertainment and educational value.

While all such shows take some liberties, and leave things out, this one did a good job of bringing the principle players and events to life. The first series took us from Washington's teenage years and his first job as an apprentice surveyor (with a tip of the hat to his childhood and his love for his half-brother Lawrence) through his days as a colonial major and then colonel, his growing anger over his treatment by British 'regular' officers as a second-class citizen and finally his becoming &#34;The Great Man&#34; as commanding general of the rebel army, including the problems of keeping that army supplied and fighting not only the British but a powerless and sometimes recalcitrant Congress at home. In between it portrays his love for his best friend's wife and his courtship with Virginia's wealthiest widow, and his ultimate love for her and her two children. The show portrays the people around him, notably Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette. It shows his struggles with other men who think they could do a better job and spend all their time trying to undermine his authority, and wraps up with his farewell address to the army and final retirement, or so he thinks.But that's not all. The 1985 sequel is also included in this set, with two lengthy episodes examining his eight years as the first President of the United States. His struggles with encroaching age and the frailties involved, his struggles with the dichotomy of being a champion of freedom while still owning slaves, the growing hostility between his Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, and Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, are all adequately portrayed.It doesn't have the gritty realism of the more recent John Adams series, and both film and music styles are firmly set in the early '80s, this piece of historical drama is still up there with the best, and well worth watching whether you are familiar with the material or not.

I finally ordered the set at the beginning of March 2014 and received it today 3/08.  There is one cover sleeve and two DVD cases, total 3 DVDs.  The DVD jacket cover is Barry Bostwick in profile close-up as President Washington in the white powdered wig.  PARTS ONE and TWO are both included in this one package for under $20.The running times match the VHS that was issued years ago.  The DVD picture quality is much higher.PART ONE  - Disc One  = 4:07:29 . . . Disc Two  = 2:27:38TOTAL 395 Minutes  (6 hours, 35 minutes)PART TWO - Disc Three = 3:16:38TOTAL 196 Minutes (3 hours, 16 minutes)This is an excellent program. It is well researched and well-written and should be seen by every American.  Without Washington, there would be no United States of America.The casting is impeccable - especially with Barry Bostwick as George Washington.  His face, his countenance, his height and build and his characterization of the great man could not be better.  Patty Duke is also excellent as Martha Custis Washington.  All the casting is superb and could not be matched today with the current pool of American and English actors available.Suitable for ages 16 and up.  Younger children will not be able to follow much of it.

Relationships are revealed as they occurred in history.  Washington's development as a man and a soldier is presented in a way that is easy to follow and understand.
