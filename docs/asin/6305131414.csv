Eric Tsang is a riot to watch with Jet Li...they have fantastic chemistry...esp. the scene where Jet Li decides to move in with him and Tsang pretends that he wants him to. lol.  As for the fighting elements:  Jet Li pulls a few moves throughout the movie, but nothing spectacular...then at the end, he tears it up!!  The movie has several hilariously memorable characters like the head of the trust board who insists &quot;Yes, I'm afraid of you, but I'm more afraid of starving&quot;...I honestly felt that Simon Yam's character was a bit extraneous, he certainly doesn't have the skills that Jet Li has and he's very unimpressive without a gun in his hands.  The scene with Eric Tsang fighting the Japanese woman is too funny.  Esp. when he says &quot;I'll take on the toughest one - the girl in the kimono&quot;.  The final fight scene is great enough to buy the movie and the very end has a nice feel-good sentiment.

He has a conscience though, and can only kill those that deserve it.  An agent for hitmen (do these guys even exist?) helps Li get the gigs he needs to be a successful hitman.  The plot of this one is certainly strange, and Li's voice changes a few times throughout the film due to the director changing the voice actors around.  The quality of video used to film this one got poorer after awhile as well - I think the budget was running thin, and the director was scrambling to finish it up.  All in all this film offers what Li's fans want...great fight scenes.  There's sword fighting and gunplay - it's all here!

It seems one particular bad guy covered himself pretty well, establishing a super fund that pays off to anyone who finds his would-be killer, a smart form of insurance. Fu (Jet Li) and the ""Crocodile Man"" (Eric Tsang) join in the hunt, and the story goes from there.Surprisingly enough, this is a very complete movie in terms of emotions; it's not all shoot, kill and kick. Crocodile Man Tsang steals the movie, pulling off a convincing con man who manages to convice Fu that he needs an agent. His acting verges on overkill, but his portrayal of a betrayed, repentant father, a hardened ex-killer, a fearful target and a saddened friend all invite the viewer to share in his emotions. Actress/Singer (aren't they all?) Gigi Leung provides a pretty face for the movie, and actually adds a dimension to the personalities of Li and Tsang's characters.Jet Li's acrobatics are showcased not only for fighting; the opening sequence shows him weaving in and out of traffic and pedestrians to retrieve some change that had dropped through a hole in his pants. He is also asked to beat up some restaurant patrons to prove to Tsang that he is worthy of the job. His skills are also showcased in escape scenes, more protective roles, and even ice skating--not your usual Jet Li fare. His portrayal of a broke, extremely selective ""killer"" is both hilarious and frightening when it needs to be.The fight scenes are on the same level as Bodyguard From Beijing or The Master, not quite Fist of Legend or Twin Warriors (Tai Chi Master) good, considering that the last two were kung fu heavy. It's a much more rounded film, where the light-hearted moments contrast nicely with the darker fight scenes.Watch this in Chinese to get the full range of Tsang's vocal gyrations and swearing.

450396,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305131414,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[24, 26]","Columbia released Contract Killer in 2002, but this movie is actually a Westernized release of Jet Li's final Hong Kong film Hitman (1998); this explains some questions that anyone watching this film today may have.  It's obvious from the beginning that this is a Hong Kong film because the voices are all dubbed (not all that impressively in spots), making it strange to listen to the hard-driving, rap-heavy soundtrack of English-language songs.  As you may have guessed, this is not the original soundtrack.  The whole movie has a weird feel to it: Jet Li's character Fu is not really the hired killer type, and it's hard to interpret the character in a good-bad dichotomy; the movie also seems to morph back and forth between action and comedy, eventually combining the two into a hybrid that entertains but doesn't feel exactly right.The film opens quite impressively, with the assassination of a rich Japanese business man; the killer is good, having basically outsmarted and defeated a whole building full of bodyguards.  Then we meet up with Fu (Li), a seemingly quite nice but cash-poor ex-soldier whom we find in the strange company of a gang of young assassins for hire.  There's never really an adequate explanation for how he got in this unexpected business.  Anyway, he's looked down upon because he has never really done a job.  When he gets wind of a $100 million reward for the capture and murder of the man soon to be known as The King of Assassins, he tries to infiltrate the proceedings.  There, he meets up with a con man named Norman (Eric Tsang), who for some unclear reason brings Fu to the meeting with him and tells him he will be his new agent.  Fu is an unlikely choice for such a big job, and his first test shows clearly that he does not really have the heart of a cold-blooded killer.  Still, he stays with Tsang and mixes it up with some major league assassins and criminals in an attempt to find the killer and claim the reward.  There isn't a whole lot of action until the final third of the film, and only one scene stands out in terms of its impressiveness and length.  The identity of the King of Killers did come as a surprise to me, although I'm sure it will be obvious to some.  The end of the film, I might add, only further exacerbates my problem with the movie's concept; Fu's occupation just doesn't jive with the character's personality.This is apparently as much of a comedy as it is an action film, thanks largely to Eric Tsang's character Norman the agent.  You can't help but like the guy, especially given the fact that he doesn't seem cut out for the whole business of contract killing; he is pretty funny for the most part, but he does ham it up a bit much in several scenes.  I think Jet Li did a fine job of acting here, but the character of Fu is by no means one of his better roles; Fu is just too vague and self-contradictory in nature.  This is not really a martial arts film, I might add.  There are several hand-to-hand contests, a couple of them involving a bad guy equipped with blinding light beams on his fingers and boots, but this is more of an action flick that just so happens to feature a few kung fu type encounters.Contract Killer does offer a good view of Jet Li in the time period immediately preceding his jump to American movie stardom, and the contrast between this particular Hong Kong film and his American films is rather striking.  You can't get the full Hong Kong experience, however, because of the dubbing and the new soundtrack used in place of the original.  Contract Killer is probably best suited for Jet Li fans because the movie itself just doesn't seem to click on all cylinders.",3,Jet Li's final Hong Kong film,1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,3669,"['Columbia', 'released', 'Contract', 'Killer', '2002', 'movie', 'actually', 'Westernized', 'release', 'Jet', 'Li', 'final', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'Hitman', '1998', 'questions', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'today', 'may', 'have', 'obvious', 'beginning', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'voices', 'are', 'dubbed', 'not', 'impressively', 'spots', 'making', 'strange', 'listen', 'hard-driving', 'rap-heavy', 'soundtrack', 'English-language', 'songs', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'not', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'whole', 'movie', 'weird', 'feel', 'Jet', 'Li', 'character', 'Fu', 'not', 'really', 'hired', 'killer', 'type', 'hard', 'interpret', 'character', 'good-bad', 'dichotomy', 'movie', 'also', 'morph', 'back', 'forth', 'action', 'comedy', 'eventually', 'combining', 'two', 'hybrid', ""n't"", 'feel', 'exactly', 'right.The', 'film', 'quite', 'impressively', 'assassination', 'rich', 'Japanese', 'business', 'man', 'killer', 'good', 'having', 'basically', 'outsmarted', 'defeated', 'whole', 'building', 'full', 'bodyguards', 'Then', 'meet', 'up', 'Fu', 'Li', 'seemingly', 'quite', 'nice', 'cash-poor', 'ex-soldier', 'whom', 'find', 'strange', 'company', 'gang', 'young', 'assassins', 'hire', 'never', 'really', 'adequate', 'explanation', 'how', 'got', 'unexpected', 'business', 'Anyway', 'looked', 'down', 'upon', 'never', 'really', 'done', 'job', 'When', 'wind', '100', 'million', 'reward', 'capture', 'murder', 'man', 'soon', 'be', 'known', 'King', 'Assassins', 'infiltrate', 'proceedings', 'up', 'con', 'man', 'named', 'Norman', 'Eric', 'Tsang', 'who', 'unclear', 'reason', 'brings', 'Fu', 'meeting', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'agent', 'Fu', 'unlikely', 'choice', 'big', 'job', 'first', 'test', 'clearly', 'not', 'really', 'have', 'heart', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'Still', 'Tsang', 'mixes', 'up', 'major', 'league', 'assassins', 'criminals', 'attempt', 'find', 'killer', 'claim', 'reward', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'action', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'scene', 'out', 'terms', 'impressiveness', 'length', 'identity', 'King', 'Killers', 'did', 'come', 'surprise', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'obvious', 'end', 'film', 'might', 'add', 'only', 'further', 'problem', 'movie', 'concept', 'Fu', 'occupation', 'just', ""n't"", 'jive', 'character', 'personality.This', 'apparently', 'as', 'much', 'comedy', 'action', 'film', 'thanks', 'largely', 'Eric', 'Tsang', 'character', 'Norman', 'agent', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'guy', 'especially', 'given', 'fact', ""n't"", 'seem', 'cut', 'out', 'whole', 'business', 'contract', 'killing', 'pretty', 'funny', 'most', 'part', 'ham', 'up', 'bit', 'much', 'several', 'scenes', 'think', 'Jet', 'Li', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'acting', 'here', 'character', 'Fu', 'means', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'Fu', 'just', 'too', 'vague', 'self-contradictory', 'nature', 'not', 'really', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'might', 'add', 'are', 'several', 'hand-to-hand', 'contests', 'couple', 'involving', 'bad', 'guy', 'equipped', 'blinding', 'light', 'beams', 'fingers', 'boots', 'more', 'action', 'flick', 'just', 'so', 'feature', 'few', 'kung', 'fu', 'type', 'encounters.Contract', 'Killer', 'offer', 'good', 'view', 'Jet', 'Li', 'time', 'period', 'immediately', 'preceding', 'jump', 'American', 'movie', 'stardom', 'contrast', 'particular', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'film', 'American', 'films', 'rather', 'striking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'full', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'experience', 'however', 'dubbing', 'new', 'soundtrack', 'used', 'place', 'original', 'Contract', 'Killer', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'Jet', 'Li', 'fans', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'click', 'cylinders']",Hitman

Thing is, everyone and their brother is after the reward, including the Japanese guy's son, who's damn intent on getting that 100 million for himself.Fu seems to have the ability to get the job done, but he's too damn nice, which is a perfect fit for Jet Li the actor. This is actually the best character Jet Li has played in a while, eschewing his humorless acting for a gentler personality. This film effectively dodges the previously inescapable Jet Li bullet: no personality. Eric Tsang and Jet Li make a good team, with Tsang edging Li in the acting department. However, Li isn't too bad, and we hear his real voice for the first time.Gigi Leung shows up as Tsang's daughter, a budding lawyer who takes a small shine to Fu. As always, she's incredibly cute but she doesn't do all that much. Simon Yam is on board as the cop intent on catching all the hitmen entering HK.There are some good action sequences that are weighed down by a sometimes confusing and slow/boring plot.

450398,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6305131414,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[2, 2]","While Contract Killer was somewhat entertaining, there were still some elements that kept this film from being as strong as many of Jet Li's standards.  For one, Li's character ""Fu"" never really clicked for me.  Fu is not a homeless character, but close to it, and suddenly finds himself with the opportunity to collect a $100 million reward for capturing a murderer known as ""The King of Killers"".  Now we know Jet Li has some of the best martial arts around, but when he unleashes in this film (which honestly felt like hardly ever) it just seems to come out of nowhere from the kind of character he plays.  His fighting does seem very limited, and well, it is.  There is only one noteworthy martial arts fight scene, and that would have to be the ending of the film.  Even that scene wasn't too rememberable compared to most Li films.  Still, the plot had some interest and Eric Tsang's character as Li's agent kept things rolling, along with a surprise on who the King of Killers turned out to be.This is what I like to call a very Americanized release of a H.K. film.  In addition to the English dubbing (though it wasn't the worst I have seen) the soundtrack is rap heavy at times.  Amusingly, there was even a rap song written for the credits titled ""Contract Killer"". Go figure.  If you are into the whole adding hip-hop to Asian cinema, you should enjoy this as some of the beats and rap were decent.The plot barely held together what was considered a long hour and half watch for me.  The fact was that there just wasn't enough action to glue it all together like most Jet Li films, or action films for that matter.  I was hoping maybe it was all being saved for the end, but even then the final fight scenes that lasted several minutes didn't do their justice.  I enjoyed the 2 main villains in this film, but had hoped for more of them in the fight scenes.  The 2nd villain - and English looking fellow - provided some originality to the fights, with a laser flasher attached to his rings and shoes.  When flashed in Jet Li's face, it blinded him momentarily, leaving him open to an attack.  But once he learned his way around it, the fight was pretty much over.Contract Killer is an average Jet Li film.  It has good moments here and there, but in the end you may be left with the feeling of ""That was it?""

I would compare it to Dragonfight where Jet only has 2 fight scenes but they are both pretty good.  This movie is actually directed by Steve Tung Wai.  Only directing 4 films in his LONG matial arts choreographing and stunt career, he really shows that he can make good movies.  I would have liked more action, but it is nice to see a well done film.Now while this movie is not thrilling whatsoever, it does put in action at the right time.  Jet starts out as a guy living with a bunch of hitmen and ends up being recruiting by some guy(Eric Tsang).  There is a killer on the loose who is taking out bad guys and a 100 million contract has been put out on him.  Seriously, 10 million wouldn't be enough?  Anyway, Tung Wai puts together a nice mix of comedy and drama but goes more for the laughs.  Simon stars in a really good role as a cop and Kenji Sato is very good as the villian.There is an unbelievably stupid action sequence with a guy that uses lasers on his fingers and feet to blind Jet while fighting but it leads to a much better fight between the 2 at the end.  The finale I thought was great and there is just enough action mixed in the beginning and middle to keep you interested in the somewhat yawner of a story.The picture quality on the Mei Eh version is pretty good and good subtitles also.  After seeing the American releases of Jet's Legend of the Red Dragon and Donnie Yen's Fist of the Red Dragon, I made sure never to watch those releases from Sony Pictures ever again.

Apparently, it was his last Hong Kong movie.  Until now, I thought Jet Li's Hong Kong films are vastly superior to his North American ones.My opinion has been altered a bit.In general, his Hong Kong flicks are better.  Contract Killer, however, is a big load of bad.  I will give the benefit of the doubt, though.  I watched a dubbed version (why are dubbed movies always so incredibly awful?), so perhaps part of the problem was the translation.  There were many places in the film where character reactions and plot points really made no sense at all.  This could have been because of horrific dubbing and translation.  I'm sure it's much more watchable in Cantonese.Nonetheless, even barring the translation barrier, this film had several strikes against it.  First of all, what was with the camera work?  One of the cameras had a badly-scuffed lens, and black scratch marks distracted me from quite a few scenes.  Also, the big fight in the elevator shaft was so dark that I really didn't have a clue what was going on.  I had no idea who was hitting who, or how.Next, the story (as in most martial arts flicks) was pretty silly.  This one seemed to be an Asian knock-off of The Boondock Saints, right down to the name of the mysterious vigilante (The King of Killers) and his over-the-top appearance during a hit (like in The Boondock Saints, he appeared from the ceiling hanging by his feet from a rope with guns blazing).Fu's (Jet Li's character) motivations seemed blatantly artificial, as well.  He's a poor ex-soldier from China who has promised to buy his mother a big mansion.  He decides to come to Hong Kong to become a hitman, yet his people-loving ways mean he doesn't want to hurt anyone.As a minor point, yet one which did distract me many times throughout the film, Jet Li has an AWFUL case of acne.  In most movies, the makeup people will do a half-way decent job of covering up blemishes, but it looks like no one bothered even trying for this movie.  Jet Li has an amazing crop of blackheads and whiteheads.  His face looks like a horrible pizza.  Poor guy.  And poor me, when I keep thinking, ""Pop it, already!"" during closeups of the pus-filled bumps on his neck and cheeks.  Eeeurgh.On the plus side, the fight scenes that were visible (like the climactic end scene) are solid.  I was pleased to see a dearth of wire tricks.  I really prefer movies with unadulterated martial arts.

The movie can be heard in English (Dolby Digital or Dolby Surround), or Spanish (apparently no Chinese option), and has a ""English for the deaf and hard of hearing"" subtitle option. The special features are: Director and cast filmographies, film trailer, ""Jet Li Bonus Trailers"" (""The One,"" ""Meltdown,"" and ""Legend of The Red Dragon""), and a photo gallery.Credits: The movie stars Jet Li (Fu; ""Romeo Must Die,"" ""Once Upon a Time in China""), Gigi Leung (Kiki; ""A True Mob Story""), Simon Yam (Kwan; ""Casino""), and Eric Tsang (Ngok Lo; ""The Accidental Spy"").  The director is Tung Wai (also known as Wei Tung; ""Fox Hunter"").  Written by Chan Heng Ka, Vincent Kok, and Cheng Kam Fa.Plot: Jet Li is a contract killer (or an ex-soldier willing to kill for money) after an assassin of a Yakuza boss.  The boss had set up a reward for the one who catches his killer.  A reward of One Hundred Million Dollars ($50 million for catching killer, $50 million for finding the ones who hired the killer).Review: Like ""Romeo Must Die,"" this film uses rap music as its movie music.  Unlike that ""Romeo"" movie, I've never heard of this Jet Li film, and am confused by it.  Due to the lack of Chinese language options, and based on the type of movie music, the movie seems as if it was intended for USA release (or rerelease), but I've never heard of it (though the movie appears to be badly dubbed and I believe that at one point, Jet Li's voice changes (odd they wouldn't have Chinese language option)).I think that the movie is supposed to be something of a comedy, and there are some funny moments, but the humor seems a little off (especially considering the enormous blood spillage). This movie is not at all like I expected.  I expected Li to be, and act, like an assassin.  Instead he is mostly a novice (a skilled one, due to be an ex-soldier), and seems at first to be incompetent (maybe ""slow"").  Despite these comments, the actions scenes are interesting, while the comedy scenes, for the most part, are not (and the evil guys have some neat tricks).The acting was average, the plot was somewhat interesting, the action scenes were good, but the comedy and music were, mostly, off-putting.
