PricelessNearly every fan who has watched Spock's Brain has been unable to sit through it without giggling a little, sustain genuine belly laughs or shake their heads in disbelief.  I have a love-hate relationship with this episode.  I love it for the simple reason that it contains some scenes that induce great laughter - or at least it does for me.  Surely, the creators of Star Trek mean us not to take this episode seriously.  Let's examine some of the elements:1. On this alien planet men have lived on the surface like savages while the women shun them and have lived below for thousands of years.  How exactly are each of them procreating?  Specifically the males living alone on the surface!2. Why are the men exiled to the surface and the women kept separately below?3. Why is it that the women's ability to learn or retain knowledge atrophied?4. Keeping in mind the relationship between men and women on the alien planet why would such a culture of women choose to take a man's brain to be their leader and instruct them in what to do?  Wouldn't they naturally have taken a woman's brain for this purpose?5. Finally, why would the women choose mini-skirts and go-go boots for daily wear?I also hate this episode for the same previously stated reasons.  The whole sequence of events as presented is illogical and absurd.  It may have seemed like a good idea in it's conception but even in 1968, when this episode first aired, the plotting used here was implausible and ludicrous.

207953,A1F7U2TQHO3A8J,6300213641,Brian Overland,"[0, 0]","""Spock's Brain"" stops just short of being a parody of every mediocre Star Trek script ever written. You see, there are these scantily-clad priestesses who serve a machine that controls their civilization. Once every 10,000 years or so, the high priestess has to go steal a brain to help run the life-support machinery (the brain pumps liquids, recirculates air, etc., actually not a bad sci-fi idea). After searching through the universe, she decides that Spock's brain is the most perfect one she's come across, so she zaps the crew of the Enterprise and makes off with the Vulcan's grey matter.The episode only lacks one element to complete the ST formula: Kirk doesn't get to seduce any of the priestesses. Not that he wouldn't like to. The males on the planet -- all troglydytes -- refer to the priestesses as ""the givers of pain and delight."" ""We've certainly seen the delightful aspects,"" comments Kirk, appreciating the women's mini skirts and go-go boots.But all that being said, if you can sit back and relax, you might be able to enjoy ""Spock's Brain"" as good campy fun. The scene at the end where McCoy has to put back the brain but regrets reconnecting Spock's vocal chords, is as funny as the writer intended.One other thing helps to redeem this episode, though it is legendary for being the worst ever of the original series. The idea of The Teacher, a device that imparts fantastic knowledge though only for a short time, is intriguing. When McCoy puts on the Teacher, the background music is dramatic, as is De Kelly's acting. ""Yes of course... a child could do it.

The rest of the story is so preposterous that I rank it in my list of the five worst episodes of the original series. A society has somehow been split where the females live underground with the technology, but understand none of it. In essence the ultimate bimbos. The males live above ground and appear to have retained some intelligence, but are considered brutes by the females. Since this society has survived for a long time, one wonders how they manage to procreate.Fortunately for the society, there is a fancy hair dryer hat that connects them directly to the computer database containing vast amounts of knowledge, including how to remove and reattach a human brain. Unfortunately, the knowledge fades from human memory after a short period of time.Females from the society obtain the knowledge that allows them to extract a brain and then beam aboard the Enterprise and remove Spock's brain, leaving the body. They apparently need it to run their machinery, since theirs are so devoid of knowledge. The quick thinking Dr. McCoy attaches a device to Spock's head that keeps his body alive and allows them to control it. The usual party beam to the planet with Spock's animated body in an attempt to recover the brain. Absurdity is piled on absurdity, as Nimoy looks like an actor trying to keep a straight Vulcan face while knowing it is ridiculous, a point he makes in his book, ""I Am Spock."" McCoy eventually puts on the hair dryer hat, gains the knowledge and is able to reattach the brain in the nick of time.The ""high"" point, other than the babes, is when Dr. McCoy says, ""I never should have connected his mouth.""

The show is the search for Spock's brain and the subsequent effort Dr. McCoy makes to reinstall it in its proper receptacle. The show does improve a little as they are reconnecting Spock's mouth, but not much. If this were an interesting episode I would go into more detail, but it was really much ado about nothing.
