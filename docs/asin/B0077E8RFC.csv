I also have no idea why the slogan mentions &#34;Raging Bull&#34; on the DVD box. It's probably one of the furthest films from &#34;Raging Bull&#34; I've ever seen. Except that they both have the word &#34;Bull&#34; in the title. Very misleading.It is in fact set in the shady world of cattle farming. At first this may seem a bit lame, but actually it's a serious business, controlled by the criminal underworld. Steroids are used and abused, and the main character has an unhealthy obsession with them. This stems from a horrific incident when he was a child, which left him damaged beyond repair.A police investigation soon raises the stakes, and its not long before suspicion takes hold and loyalties are forgotten.The film is in Flemish with subs, and is quite gritty and dark throughout. It takes time to get to understand the main character, as at first, he is far from likable. One scene in particular will not have you sitting comfortably, at all. While the film as a whole may leave you in need of cheering up.

1527422,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0077E8RFC,C. Sawin,"[28, 30]","Bullhead is the story of Jacky Vanmarsenille (Matthias Schoenaerts) a cattle farmer. He along with his business partners inject their cows with steroids and hormones to achieve the results they desire. The problem is the only thing Jacky injects more than his cows is himself as he's got some sort of chemical compound coursing through his veins at all times. Things begin to go south when Jacky makes a deal to distribute his cows to a well-known yet crooked meat trader. A federal agent is killed amongst their negotiations as Jacky is dragged into the investigation and his disturbing past comes bubbling to the surface.Matthias Schoenaerts' performance is the first thing that will win you over. The reason why he shoots up so frequently along with what he injects himself with has this really breathtaking explanation. Schoenaerts has a short fuse the entire film and you never know when he's going to explode. That's the beauty of his performance. He's so dangerous yet you can't help but feel sympathy for the guy. Schoenaerts is a ferocious powerhouse that chews you up and spits you out like the most devastating hurricane imaginable.Bullhead features some incredibly impressive cinematography. Belgium has never looked so beautiful. Those shots of the sky and the clouds that populate every inch of it and those lush moments of taking in the countryside speak volumes. Something as simple as grass blowing in the wind is made to look like this grand accomplishment thanks to how the film was shot. It was interesting to see characters that were out of frame become out of focus and or blurred in some way; whether they were approaching somebody in frame or walking away. It was a masterful touch.The Belgian drama has a unique sense of perspective, as well. The dizzying staircase sequence near the end of the film is the best example. It kind of goes hand in hand with the cinematography though; a brilliant looking film is even better with distinguishing shots. Speaking of unique, the entire film is one of the more original experiences to grace the silver screen in quite some time. Bullhead does draw comparisons to films like Drive and even Bronson, but the mafia and mobster kind of storyline is presented in this rough, grainy, meaty, and intense package that hasn't been done before. Bronson is actually a really great comparison. Matthias Schoenaerts put on 59 pounds of muscle for Bullhead and Tom Hardy put on 42 pounds of muscle for Bronson. While the two films are almost nothing alike when it comes to their storylines, they're extremely similar at their core.Bullhead is an extremely intense piece of cinema that includes a fairly bloody and hard hitting elevator sequence that rivals that infamous scene from Drive. With an incredible performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, gorgeous camera work, and a huge injection of originality, Bullhead should not be missed by anyone especially those who are looking for something different when it comes to movies. This comes highly recommended for those who enjoyed Animal Kingdom, A Prophet, Drive, and/or Bronson.",4,Intense and powerful,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,3083,"['Bullhead', 'story', 'Jacky', 'Vanmarsenille', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'cattle', 'farmer', 'along', 'business', 'partners', 'inject', 'cows', 'steroids', 'hormones', 'achieve', 'results', 'desire', 'problem', 'only', 'thing', 'Jacky', 'more', 'cows', 'got', 'sort', 'chemical', 'compound', 'coursing', 'veins', 'times', 'Things', 'begin', 'go', 'south', 'when', 'Jacky', 'deal', 'distribute', 'cows', 'well-known', 'yet', 'crooked', 'meat', 'trader', 'federal', 'agent', 'killed', 'amongst', 'negotiations', 'Jacky', 'dragged', 'investigation', 'disturbing', 'past', 'bubbling', 'surface.Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'performance', 'first', 'thing', 'will', 'win', 'reason', 'why', 'shoots', 'up', 'so', 'frequently', 'what', 'really', 'breathtaking', 'explanation', 'Schoenaerts', 'short', 'fuse', 'entire', 'film', 'never', 'know', 'when', 'going', 'explode', 'beauty', 'performance', 'so', 'dangerous', 'yet', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'guy', 'Schoenaerts', 'ferocious', 'powerhouse', 'up', 'spits', 'most', 'devastating', 'hurricane', 'imaginable.Bullhead', 'incredibly', 'impressive', 'cinematography', 'Belgium', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'sky', 'clouds', 'populate', 'inch', 'lush', 'moments', 'taking', 'countryside', 'speak', 'volumes', 'Something', 'as', 'simple', 'grass', 'blowing', 'wind', 'made', 'look', 'grand', 'accomplishment', 'thanks', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'characters', 'were', 'frame', 'become', 'focus', 'blurred', 'way', 'were', 'approaching', 'somebody', 'frame', 'walking', 'away', 'was', 'masterful', 'touch.The', 'Belgian', 'drama', 'unique', 'sense', 'perspective', 'as', 'well', 'dizzying', 'staircase', 'sequence', 'end', 'film', 'best', 'example', 'kind', 'hand', 'hand', 'cinematography', 'brilliant', 'looking', 'film', 'even', 'better', 'distinguishing', 'shots', 'Speaking', 'unique', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'original', 'experiences', 'grace', 'silver', 'screen', 'quite', 'time', 'Bullhead', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'films', 'Drive', 'even', 'Bronson', 'mafia', 'mobster', 'kind', 'storyline', 'presented', 'rough', 'grainy', 'meaty', 'intense', 'package', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'before', 'Bronson', 'actually', 'really', 'great', 'comparison', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'put', '59', 'pounds', 'muscle', 'Bullhead', 'Tom', 'Hardy', 'put', '42', 'pounds', 'muscle', 'Bronson', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'almost', 'nothing', 'alike', 'when', 'storylines', ""'re"", 'extremely', 'similar', 'core.Bullhead', 'extremely', 'intense', 'piece', 'cinema', 'fairly', 'bloody', 'hard', 'hitting', 'elevator', 'sequence', 'infamous', 'scene', 'Drive', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Matthias', 'Schoenaerts', 'gorgeous', 'camera', 'work', 'huge', 'injection', 'originality', 'Bullhead', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anyone', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'when', 'movies', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'Animal', 'Kingdom', 'A', 'Prophet', 'Drive', 'Bronson']",Bullhead

Schoenaerts' is Oscar material and the plot about his chilhood traumatic experience and aggressiveness in his adulthood is quite moving and scary respectively.

So much so it might take the viewer some time to get his footing while watching. For me, this was such a film.Here's the scoop. Jacky had a tragic incident in his past. He's a cattle farmer in Belgium and is constantly injecting himself with hormones and steroids. He also illegally pumps up his cattle. He's in on a deal involving high tech cattle hormones. A detective gets killed during the investigation and things begin to unravel. Add to this the fact that he has come across a woman tied to his past tragedy and he's in for some heavy soul searching.This is not your usual crime thriller. Some of the bad guys are bad guys. Some of the good guys are good guys. But some occupy the fuzzy world in between. Such as Jacky himself. He's a thick, brutish guy who can kill you with his bare hands, but when you learn of his past, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to hate him. When he crosses paths with the woman tied to his past, his attempts to try and hook up with her are pitiful. As he notes of himself: All he's known all his life are animals. He cannot interact well with people. The end to all of this is fitting but it will break your heart.I would need to see it again because some of the finer plot points got past me. I can't say if it was me or the way it was handled but I need a second viewing. That aside, it's remarkable that this is director Michael Roskam's first feature length film. He has a deft touch and mixes beauty and ugliness to drive home the sense of being trapped. Matthias Schoenaerts, as Jacky, has a lot of credits under his belt. He uses that experience here to create a truly memorable character.

1527429,A2R60DUF9N2KKK,B0077E8RFC,Harry O,"[0, 0]","The powerful Belgian film Bullhead received a well-deserved nomination for Bet Foreign Film. Ostensibly about the Belgian underworld, specifically its involvement in the distribution of illegal growth hormones for livestock, the film is much more than just a gangster opus. The film has a number of violent scenes, one involving the main character's traumatic childhood experience that is, quite literally, almost unwatchable. yet this scene is absolutely essential to understand the development (both physical and emotional) of Jacky, the main character. The obvious parallel - that Jacky too must take hormones, and does so to excess - is only one if the subtexts of this unforgettable film. In the role of Jacky as an adult, Matthias Schoenaerts gives and absolutely stunning performance. He is an animal in both the physical sense (the hormones have, in a sense, ""made"" him into a bull) and an emotional sense (his desire for love but his inability to give or take it). Like some of his famous predecessors (for example, De Niro in Raging Bull and Bale in The Mechanic and Fighter), Schoenaerts physically transformed himself into the bulked-up protagonist. But, as with De Niro and Bale, his performance goes far deeper than the physical transformation - his eyes are dead, and you feel as if he has lost his sold as a result of that childhood trauma.

Either the language barrier or the difference in lifestyles make them hard to follow along and relate to. But on occasion even those items can be leapt over and a solid story can be told and understood. Such is the case here.Jacky is a beef farmer whose cattle are filled with growth hormones to increase their size and value. He makes a deal with an unscrupulous veterinarian to supply beef to a Flemish trader who is currently under investigation. When a federal inspector is murdered and it looks like this Flemish buyer is involved, Jacky wants out. But there is too much at stake for them to lose his product.Good enough for one story but there is another going on as well underneath. A henchman for the Flemish gangster is Diedrik, a friend of Jacky's 20 years earlier. The two don't acknowledge one another in the gangster's presence but there is something going on. It seems that something happened 20 years ago that made them part ways and has had a lasting effect on Jacky, something that Diedrik wants to make up for.This movie works on a number of levels. To begin with while taking place in a rather dull colored area, the look of the film is marvelous. Shots are well placed and the feel of what life is like in Belgium where it takes place comes through clearly. The acting, while in a language different than mine, is so well done that you sense every nuance each actor is trying to explore and offer each viewer. The story is one that draws you in from the start but slowly unravels to reveal all the secrets that began 20 years ago.Midway through the film a flashback sequence relates just what it was that happened back when. It is painful to watch and chilling as well. To say that what happened will be something that sticks with all the characters involved is to simplify it. If you are at all squeamish it will bother you, not because of the visuals (which are nearly non-existent) but because your mind can create something worse than they could have shown.Foreign films get a bad rep with the casual moviegoer. This is sad because stories can be the same all over the world, giving us things to contemplate and enjoy. If you love movies, get over the idea that you have to read the film and notice that you're getting the visual as well. Truth be told when you witness a foreign film you probably pay more attention because of the sub titles. You have to focus on the screen and not let yourself be distracted by texts, crying babies or someone who wants to talk during the movie.

The murder of a cop, and the farmer's sudden need for revenge against those who wronged him long ago, catapult events to a shocking finish.Directed by Michael R.

1527440,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B0077E8RFC,Paul Allaer,"[14, 15]","""Bullhead"" (2011 release from Belgium; 128 min.) brings the story of Jacky Vanmarsenille who raises cattle on his family farm in Flanders, Belgium (close to the language border with French-speaking Wallonia). The movie begins with Jacky becoming involved with the so-called ""hormone maffia"". Soon thereafter we get a second parallel story line into the movie, which starts off with some traumatic events for Jacky taking place 20 years ago when he was 12-13 years old and which cause Jacky to have trouble developing relationships with women. The first hour of the movie edvelops rather slowly, developing the characters and bringing context to the overall movie, but it sets the stage for a very intense second hour of the movie, in which it all comes together. I wish I could say more of the plot line but it really would spoil some of the surprises in the movie, so you'll just have to trust me when I say that you will be at the edge of your seat as the movie goes down to its conclusion.Several thoughts and comments: (1) Matthias Schoenaerts does an incredible job in the title role of the movie. A very physical presence and performance. (2) Even though this is a ""Flemish"" movie, about one-third of the movie actually takes place in and around French-speaking Liege. I mention this as the contrast between Flanders and Wallonia is an important element of the movie. (3) This movie is not for the faint of heart: there are a number of violent and bloody scenes thoughout the movie. (4) If you can handle the violence and brutality, you are in for a treat as this movie is very well done, showing once again that you don't need $250 million (the reported budget of the upcoming Disney movie ""John Carter"") to produce an engaging and entertaining (if rough and tough) movie.Last but not least, I am a native Belgian (although now a long-time resident of the US) and I couldn't help but feel some pride to see that a ""little"" country like Belgium can produce such a quality movie once in a while. The movie is nominated for Best Foreign Film Oscar, and I guess I'll find out later tonight if it won. No, this movie is not for everyone, but if you do like foreign and indie movies, I can assure you that you'll appreciate and enjoy ""Bullhead"".

Roskam's feature debut film ""Bullhead"" (""Rundskop"") a crime drama, but I think it would be more accurate to call the Belgian film a character study. The film's tension comes less from the plot that is sometimes hard to follow, than from the exceptional performance of the star Matthias Schoenaerts as Jacky Vanmarsenille, a young cattle farmer making a deal involving growth hormones.The shady deal results in a chain reaction of events including a murder of a police officer investigating illegal use of hormones, and Jacky's reunion with his childhood friend Diederik (Jeroen Perceval). As the film slowly (very slowly) unfolds, secrets about Jacky's past still traumatizing him will be revealed.The narrative is complicated with a few flashbacks (where a very painful thing happens to a young boy), but the presence of Matthias Schoenaerts as Jacky almost makes us forget that. He is the driving force of the film throughout, as we come to understand what he has lost but still yearns for. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film (but lost to ""A Separation"") and that is not surprising.But the unnecessarily complex narrative structure including subplots about a police detective, and some uninspired moments involving the police investigation are so disappointing. Frankly I don't see the point of telling a story (itself a good one) in this confusing way. Or have I missed something?What you will not miss is the powerhouse acting from Matthias Schoenaerts.

1527445,A3QIVW3MEH1SKA,B0077E8RFC,Vlitch Godunov,"[4, 4]","'Bullhead' is one of those films that you will either love or hate. Not to do with the acting, perhaps to do with the subtitles, but moreover to do with the fact that it is a long, dark, foreign indie film that doesn't stray too far from the path of cow farming and the mafia that can sometimes go with that.But, to miss out on viewing this masterpiece, to not witness what has to be one of the most incredible, passionately heartbreaking, violently stoic movies of the past decade is to have let something breathtaking avoid your gaze.The film opens with a spoken warning that, basically, things long since buried have a way to still come back and bite you in the ass! Our lead actor, a domineering brute of a cattle farmer Jacky Vanmarsenille (played by a pumped-up-for-the-role Mattias Schoenaerts) is hooked on all manner of drugs. Why, we don't know quite yet, but nevertheless he is a force to be reckoned with - for others and himself. It turns out he is using Androstederm to fatten his cows. It fattens the animals in 8 weeks, not 10 weeks and after injected half an hour later is out of their system. It also adds 10% fat to their body weight! Jacky also uses it in small doses.It turns out that in Belgium there is such a thing as the Hormone Mafia Underworld, which deals in such acts as this with other farmers. But why is Jacky so angry when he makes all this money, well, that is shown in a 20 year flashback to being a young boy; and the cruel, painful victim of a mentally-challenged older boy. An act that went unpunished at the time, it changed Jacky's life forever and put him instantly on the path of self-destruction.Having taken growth hormones since being a little boy, we see how he views women, sex, gives out beatings and keeps injecting himself day in day out. His harrowing ordeal back all those years ago is hard, so very tough to watch (as a man), but suddenly explains everything as we progress.His young friend at the time, Dieterick is now a distant adult friend of his, but out of nowhere he finds out that when he goes to do a new cow drugging deal, there is his old friend - worryingly involved in the whole thing. Now he's taking more, just to get by. Such high profile drugs as Sustanon, Mestanolone and Methyltestosterone which is making him think less and act more (hence the title of the film).There are brutal scenes of a nightclub beating, a REAL cow gets cut open and has her calf removed (you simply couldn't fake that, for as the knife cuts the cow moans and flinches), and soon Jacky is visiting the long-lost never-had woman he could have had in his life. And so, as we get to the finale of this incredible film, Jacky is ploughed on as many drugs as he can inject and digest and takes on the world in one last stand.The director, in the special features behind-the-scenes tells the young boy who plays the Young Dieterick in the flim that Jacky's spirit will come back and inherit the body of him in 'Bullhead 2.' The boy never flinches and says, ""I'll still be playing the role, yes?"" To which the director sarcastically responds with, Yes, ... but ten years from now!"" We can only hope.

1527446,A1IN3AZD6NZRSG,B0077E8RFC,wadrad,"[0, 0]","""Wow""..that's how I felt when this movie wrapped up.  Not necessarily ""wow that was great"" or ""wow that was bad""...just ""wow"".First off, this is yet another depressing-as-heck look at life and the harsh twists and turns it can smack folks with (one ""folk"" in particular in this movie).  The folks in this flick getting smacked by life also just happen to be everyday Belgians  who earn a living raising cattle and livestock, but who are also involved in the trade and use of growth hormones for the cattle they're raising.  Seems like a boring enough setup for a story, but this one STILL plays out with big impact as written and directed by Michal R. Roskam, and acted by the predominantly Flemish cast.  I'm not sure I've EVER seen an uplifting or hopeful movie come out of Belgium.  There are a few goofy comedies (like Iedereen Beroemd - Everybody's Famous) that aren't too depressing, but for the most part, the prominent flicks from Belgium are gritty, in-your-face, and emotionally taxing.  This pretty much fits the same mold.Don't want to go into the plot, as it has been amply described in other reviews, but I wanted to give any folks considering this movie a little help to decide whether it's worth renting (I wouldn't consider buying this just because I'm not sure I'd want to watch it multiple times...it's just too much of a bummer, though for me, a bummer worth watching at least once).Some pluses:** CinematographyAs I've seen in a few other Belgian movies, the landscape almost plays a supporting character.  Long shots of farm fields and morning mist punctuate scene transitions and very much add to the mood of the film.  Everything just seems so ""real-life"" and the filming captures it wonderfully.** PerformancesMatthias Schoenaerts, the lead, is awesome as a steroid-addicted, broken shell of a man (as least what he thinks a man is supposed to be), heavily shaped by a childhood tragedy and struggling to get by day-to-day.  He IS the majority of the weight of the movie.  But, the rest of the supporting actors are all solid as well and there are no weak performances to detract from the rest of the story.** PlotWho would have thought an interesting enough story line could be developed around tragedy and growth hormone peddling Belgian ranchers?  I personally preferred the way the plot wasn't clear at first.  The viewer is allowed to do a little guess work regarding who is who and how the different elements in the story all relate.Some negatives:** It's just so dang heavyThe whole mood, the story, the performances.  MAN, there's nothing that puts a smile on your face in the whole movie.  And there's not supposed to be, so if you realize that going in, hopefully it's less of a negative.** Story flowIt's a little hard to follow at first, starting in supposed present-day and then flashing back  at odd times to the main character's youth.  It all comes together later in the story (mostly), but it's a little odd at first.So, 3.5 stars with a round-up to 4.  Worth watching for fans of storytelling and cinema (I think), but maybe not a great Friday night popcorn flick for forgetting your troubles.

1527447,A2ZHSORK1HHYTT,B0077E8RFC,Willy D. Reviewer,"[4, 10]","I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  This film is neither ""intense"" nor ""powerful"".  In the beginning of the film, our protagonist lightly slaps around a guy who owes money.  Nothing happens after that until about hour later into the film, when he beats a guy into a coma because he cut in on a girl he was trying to make time with in a night club.  Those are the only two times he demonstrates his roid rage.Actually, he plays a rather shy, stupid guy throughout the film.  He is never on the explosive edge.And there is a really big problem with the plot:  The Belgian ""Mafia"" are suppose to be interested in the cattle market?  One kilo of white powder will produce more profit than the entire cattle market of Belgium.  Why not have the Belgian Mafia interested in cornering the grain market, or the ball bearing market, or the stolen car market?  These too are all high exposure risks and extremely low profit enterprises.  It's like a couple of screenwriters said ""How can we build a story around a cattle farmer who takes steroids?  I know -- let's add the Mafia, and give the guy a traumatic childhood experience!""  Good grief, they didn't ask each other ""Is there money in the cattle market?""  NO!And there is one more problem: The little blond 12 yr old girl love interest, grows up as a dark brunette, looking nothing like her younger counter part.  It's like having a tall blond Dutch girl grow up to be a short dark haired Italian.  When this woman's character is made clear in the film, you will say ""They couldn't find a tall blond actress in all of Belgium?""Yeah, I bought the film based upon the multi-star reviews.
