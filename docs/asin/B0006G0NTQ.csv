Instead, Megatron escapes, Rhinox disappears, and it looks like the whole planet is their enemy. But Optimus Primal has discovered a secret deep within the planet's core that may lead to their salvation.

I hope they will make part 2 very soon.Ok what you get on it are 5 episodes1. The Reformatting2. Master of the house3. Fires of the past4. Mercenary Pursuits5. Forbidden FruitI thought for the price I was getting the entire series, but I was mistaken as a Transformers fan I wanted it for my collection, so I did not mind. I wish they had placed on the info page the details of what you get when you buy it. Cause it did not say part one I assumed it was the entire series but it was not.When you buy it the case says volume one on the back.Also their was no special features which I was hoping for. But it you are a Transformers fan who wants to collect the entire collection it is worth it. Plus I enjoyed the fact that Black Arachnia still was looking for her long lost love. I was glad that part was still included!

866761,AQT225FIBS078,B0006G0NTQ,"Mr. President ""2016""","[19, 41]","After hearing about the ""continuation"" of the Beast Wars series, I was overwhelmed with joy.  But after viewing this waste of time and effort, I am sad to report that all that was once sacred with the original Beast Wars has been turned to slag.  ""Transformation?""  What the eff?  No guns?  Energy blasts from Optimus's uni-nipple and plant/tree things?  I have vomited more interesting things than this durge.  After it was revelaed that the true intention of Cybertron was to harvest organic life, I took an organic dump.  My dump kind of resembled the plotline from Beast Machines and/or Joanie loves Chachi...lumpy and full of gelatinous nuts.  What sort of demographic were the writers aiming for?  Tree-hugging transforming hippies who want nothing more than to ""become?""  There are several other bad things about this show that I can't even recall.  I had more fun getting bridgework done.  I'm not talking about the Space Bridge Gen 1 fans.  Hardy har har.  If only the virus that killed most of the Cybertronians in Beast Machines could have leaked into the writer's room, we could have all been saved.  I blame the Fox Kids network and their religious propaganda for promoting such crap.  If I could have rated this stink nugget in the negatives, I would have.  I can't even get a zero on this thing.  It should be a negative billion cajillion.  I push that everyone find this review helpful.On a side note, I do like the soundtrack.",1,"WOW, WHAT A DUMP!!",1112227200,"03 31, 2005",2005,1443,"['hearing', 'continuation', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'series', 'was', 'overwhelmed', 'joy', 'viewing', 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'am', 'sad', 'report', 'was', 'once', 'sacred', 'original', 'Beast', 'Wars', 'been', 'turned', 'slag', 'Transformation', 'What', 'eff', 'guns', 'Energy', 'blasts', 'Optimus', 'uni-nipple', 'plant/tree', 'things', 'have', 'vomited', 'more', 'interesting', 'things', 'durge', 'was', 'revelaed', 'true', 'intention', 'Cybertron', 'was', 'harvest', 'organic', 'life', 'took', 'organic', 'dump', 'dump', 'kind', 'resembled', 'plotline', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'Joanie', 'Chachi', 'lumpy', 'full', 'gelatinous', 'nuts', 'What', 'sort', 'demographic', 'were', 'writers', 'aiming', 'Tree-hugging', 'transforming', 'hippies', 'who', 'want', 'nothing', 'more', 'become', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'bad', 'things', 'show', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'recall', 'had', 'more', 'fun', 'getting', 'bridgework', 'done', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'Space', 'Bridge', 'Gen', '1', 'fans', 'Hardy', 'har', 'har', 'only', 'virus', 'killed', 'most', 'Cybertronians', 'Beast', 'Machines', 'could', 'have', 'leaked', 'writer', 'room', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'saved', 'blame', 'Fox', 'Kids', 'network', 'religious', 'propaganda', 'promoting', 'such', 'crap', 'could', 'have', 'rated', 'stink', 'nugget', 'negatives', 'would', 'have', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'zero', 'thing', 'should', 'be', 'negative', 'billion', 'cajillion', 'push', 'everyone', 'find', 'review', 'side', 'note', 'do', 'soundtrack']",Beast Machines: Transformers
