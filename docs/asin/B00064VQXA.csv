The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a ""history"" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets ""evidence"" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge ""clues"" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else.

I still haven't become enamored with C.S.I. NY, but I have to admit C.S.I. Miami has me hooked.  David Caruso's Horatio Caine is both decent and fair while remaining a hardened cop.  That is a delicate balance difficult to pull off, especially in one hour episodes, but he accomplishes it with aplomb.  I recommend this series to anyone interested in the genre.

860728,A2N360HEDIDYDG,B00064VQXA,William Wilson,"[0, 0]","Although I despise this show I bought this collection because it happened to feature both Deanna Wright (Kay Bennett) and Molly Stanton (Charity, Evil Charity, Zombie Charity...) from the long canceled daytime drama Passions in separate episodes, 'Innocent' and 'The Oath' respectively. Both women had left the soap by the time this aired. Deanna plays a young porn star (but not just any kind of porn star--as always in these asinine programs every kind of porn turns out to be, secretly, either kiddie porn, or monkey porn, or snuff films or whatever other damn thing the holy rollers who write this stuff can come up with) who gets strangled to death by a frazzled masturbator. (Aren't they all?) Interestingly, despite this or her role as Kay, someone about as far from Godly as you can get, Wright was supposedly a devout Christian who went on, I understand, to become a wife and stay at home mommy and Sunday school teacher. (This Christian devotion was allegedly why she left Passions, refusing to perform in scenes she felt revealed too much nudity or were too highly sexual.) Unfortunately she has a minimum of screen time in the episode, sexual or otherwise, and is pretty much lost in the morass of its painfully self righteous, ham acted morality crusade. Perhaps, as a Christian, this is how she rationalized her appearance in the role: as a cautionary tale for other, less devout girls. For her part Ms. Stanton plays a bubblegum chewing street prostitute who gets mixed up in the shooting of a cop. Sexy, but again, her actual screen time is fairly limited. Stanton went on to star in the WB sitcom 'Twins', where she worked with Sara Gilbert, Melanie Griffith, and Mark Linn-Baker. I'm giving C.S.I. Miami, at least this season of it, five stars for its incalculable Passions/Deanna/Molly value, but also to acknowledge, with grudging respect, how awful, nearly execrable, television can be in the proper hands.
