1371247,A1D17I3PY4OOOJ,B003Y58CKI,Charles Beck,"[79, 86]","This DVD recording of Gounod's Faust is based on a 2004 production from the Royal Opera House. It is certainly an improvement over the offensive 1985 production directed by Ken Russell for the Vienna State Opera (see my review). In this production, the three lead singers, Alagna as Faust, Gheorghiu as Marguerite, and Bryn Terfel as Mephistopheles, are in top voice and their acting is also convincing. If based solely on the vocal and acting qualities, this production probably deserves at least four stars. Alagna is especially dramatic in portraying the transition from an aging to a revitalized Faust. When have you experienced a young Faust, let alone a tenor, who turns a cartwheel after discovering his youth has returned? Gheorghiu successfully portrays both the lyrical and the deranged Marguerite. Terfel has a fine voice but lacks the bass resonance and mischievous sound that the late Nicolai Ghiaurov brought to the role. Sophie Koch portrays a very lively and lovesick Siebel, and Simon Keenlyside, although a bit stiff in his portrayal, conveys Marguerite's righteous and protective brother, Valentin.While opera is first and foremost a vocal experience, it also has a strong visual dimension, especially with the intimate close ups provided on DVD's. The stage settings and costumes become an integral part of the experience. Changing or updating original opera settings seems to be a popular and often inappropriate trend among current stage directors. It may work as long as the altered staging and costumes don't distract from the story or the vocal atmosphere that the composer had in mind. In this production, cabaret Paris takes the place of Medieval Germany, the relocation works reasonably well with a few notable exceptions. For example, Marguerite first appears strolling in front of a cabaret backdrop of flashing lights instead of a town fair. The atmosphere is entertaining but rather at odds with the more innocent Marguerite who, in Gounod's version, later sings a ballad while seated by a spinning wheel.  Incidentally, in Goethe's marvelous poetry, Marguerite responds to Faust's overtures by stating, ""I'm neither a lady nor am I fair, And I can go home without your care."" Faust realizes that she has a coy side to her personality, but is actually ""virtuous and pure"" and certainly not a cabaret pick up.In the garden scene in Act III, we find that the garden has been paved over to resemble a city street--not quite the romantic atmosphere for the beautiful and very heartfelt arias that follow and what the composer and librettist had in mind. As a result, Faust sings the sublime cavatina ""Salut! Demeure,"" which praises Marguerite's surroundings as a ""chaste and pure abode"" while leaning against her two story house (apartment?) on a street corner. Could the stage director have confused the garden scene in Faust with ""On the Street Where You Live"" in the musical My Fair Lady? And poor Siebel has to gather a few struggling flowers growing on the edge of some concrete stairs. Oh well, it appears that romanticism is out and revisionist and more glitzy settings are the current vogue.It was a delight to learn that this production, unlike most stagings of Faust, includes the famous ballet music in Act IV. Unfortunately, not all of the pieces are included and instead of having Faust focus on the most beautiful women in history, as both Goethe and Gounod intended, the dancing and music quickly turns into a ghoulish orgy and loud laughter that obscures the music and minimizes the dancing. On the sideline, a hairy Mephistopheles appears as a transvestite in lingerie. Amusing, perhaps, but even the devil had a degree of dignity and self-pride. One wonders if Bryn Terfel looked at himself in a mirror before appearing on stage.In conclusion, this production of Faust is probably worth purchasing if you are willing to overlook some questionable staging and costuming. Why is it that so many misguided modern directors are either unaware of what the composer and librettist had in mind or they simply don't care? However, we can only hope that we won't have to wait another 20 years for a somewhat more respectful and faithful production of one of the most popular operas ever written and clearly Gounod's most critically acclaimed opera.",3,"Strong Vocalizing, Questionable Staging",1288483200,"10 31, 2010",2010,4285,"['DVD', 'recording', 'Gounod', 'Faust', 'based', '2004', 'production', 'Royal', 'Opera', 'House', 'certainly', 'improvement', 'offensive', '1985', 'production', 'directed', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'Vienna', 'State', 'Opera', 'see', 'review', 'production', 'three', 'lead', 'singers', 'Alagna', 'Faust', 'Gheorghiu', 'Marguerite', 'Bryn', 'Terfel', 'Mephistopheles', 'are', 'top', 'voice', 'acting', 'also', 'convincing', 'based', 'solely', 'vocal', 'acting', 'qualities', 'production', 'probably', 'least', 'four', 'stars', 'Alagna', 'especially', 'dramatic', 'portraying', 'transition', 'aging', 'revitalized', 'Faust', 'When', 'have', 'experienced', 'young', 'Faust', 'let', 'alone', 'tenor', 'who', 'cartwheel', 'discovering', 'youth', 'returned', 'Gheorghiu', 'successfully', 'lyrical', 'deranged', 'Marguerite', 'Terfel', 'fine', 'voice', 'bass', 'resonance', 'mischievous', 'sound', 'late', 'Nicolai', 'Ghiaurov', 'brought', 'role', 'Sophie', 'Koch', 'very', 'lively', 'lovesick', 'Siebel', 'Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'bit', 'stiff', 'portrayal', 'Marguerite', 'righteous', 'protective', 'brother', 'Valentin.While', 'opera', 'first', 'foremost', 'vocal', 'experience', 'also', 'strong', 'visual', 'dimension', 'especially', 'intimate', 'close', 'ups', 'provided', 'DVD', 'stage', 'settings', 'become', 'integral', 'part', 'experience', 'Changing', 'updating', 'original', 'opera', 'settings', 'be', 'popular', 'often', 'inappropriate', 'trend', 'current', 'stage', 'directors', 'may', 'work', 'as', 'long', 'altered', 'staging', 'costumes', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'story', 'vocal', 'atmosphere', 'composer', 'had', 'mind', 'production', 'cabaret', 'Paris', 'place', 'Medieval', 'Germany', 'relocation', 'reasonably', 'well', 'few', 'notable', 'exceptions', 'example', 'Marguerite', 'first', 'strolling', 'front', 'cabaret', 'backdrop', 'flashing', 'lights', 'instead', 'town', 'fair', 'atmosphere', 'entertaining', 'rather', 'odds', 'more', 'innocent', 'Marguerite', 'who', 'Gounod', 'version', 'later', 'ballad', 'seated', 'spinning', 'wheel', 'Incidentally', 'Goethe', 'marvelous', 'poetry', 'Marguerite', 'Faust', 'overtures', 'stating', ""'m"", 'lady', 'am', 'fair', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'care', 'Faust', 'coy', 'side', 'personality', 'actually', 'virtuous', 'pure', 'certainly', 'not', 'cabaret', 'pick', 'garden', 'scene', 'Act', 'III', 'find', 'garden', 'been', 'paved', 'resemble', 'city', 'street', 'not', 'quite', 'romantic', 'atmosphere', 'beautiful', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'arias', 'follow', 'what', 'composer', 'librettist', 'had', 'mind', 'result', 'Faust', 'sublime', 'cavatina', 'Salut', 'Demeure', 'Marguerite', 'surroundings', 'chaste', 'pure', 'abode', 'leaning', 'two', 'story', 'house', 'apartment', 'street', 'corner', 'Could', 'stage', 'director', 'have', 'confused', 'garden', 'scene', 'Faust', 'Street', 'Where', 'Live', 'musical', 'My', 'Fair', 'Lady', 'poor', 'Siebel', 'gather', 'few', 'struggling', 'flowers', 'growing', 'edge', 'concrete', 'stairs', 'Oh', 'well', 'romanticism', 'out', 'revisionist', 'more', 'glitzy', 'settings', 'are', 'current', 'vogue.It', 'was', 'delight', 'learn', 'production', 'most', 'stagings', 'Faust', 'famous', 'ballet', 'music', 'Act', 'IV', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'pieces', 'are', 'included', 'instead', 'having', 'Faust', 'focus', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'history', 'Goethe', 'Gounod', 'intended', 'dancing', 'music', 'quickly', 'ghoulish', 'orgy', 'loud', 'laughter', 'music', 'dancing', 'sideline', 'hairy', 'Mephistopheles', 'transvestite', 'lingerie', 'Amusing', 'perhaps', 'even', 'devil', 'had', 'degree', 'dignity', 'self-pride', 'One', 'Bryn', 'Terfel', 'looked', 'mirror', 'appearing', 'stage.In', 'conclusion', 'production', 'Faust', 'probably', 'worth', 'purchasing', 'are', 'willing', 'overlook', 'questionable', 'staging', 'costuming', 'Why', 'so', 'many', 'misguided', 'modern', 'directors', 'are', 'unaware', 'what', 'composer', 'librettist', 'had', 'mind', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'However', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'wait', '20', 'years', 'somewhat', 'more', 'respectful', 'faithful', 'production', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'operas', 'ever', 'written', 'clearly', 'Gounod', 'most', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'opera']",N/A

Terfel in a dress is certainly decadent and devilish but maybe too much.Gheorghiu is good in the roll though perhaps a bit past the age prime to be the enchantress.

It's not to say that I haven't been looking but had simply not found one that I wanted to take a chance on.When I discovered this recording, done at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, I decided to take a chance on it and hope for the best. I have just finished watching Act 5 and am wildly enthusiastic about this recording. The sound in DTS 5.1 is flawless, the high definition video recording is crisp and clear and the soloists, chorus, and orchestra all turn in stellar performances. I was literally moved to tears at a number of points as the opera progressed. It was such a joy to hear those familiar melodies which I knew so well from the past performed again with power and emotion!The two DVD set includes a booklet which offers a summary of the production and a brief synopsis of the 5 acts. Yes, it does include the ballet sequence which was added in 1869, ten years after its first production. The ballet sequence as performed here adds interesting ambience to the opera and helps define the depraved nature of Mephistopheles.

1371252,ANJFW8DZ4ZCNK,B003Y58CKI,DDD,"[21, 27]","A cursory review of all the available recordings and/or tapings of Faust on either LP, CD or DVD this new (2004) staging from ROH is clearly the leading contender. This doesn't make it the best, but the balance sheet is clearly in the black. It was my understanding that the performance would never be released due to difficulties that were never revealed although that must have been an initial thinking in the casting and its being shown on British TV. Whatever the problems were they have been overcome.It may be in the notes but try as I might I was unable to find out who was the director; a Google search cleared up the problem: David McVicar. This was the first new production of Faust in many years at ROH. McVicar has moved the time period up to Gounod's, the mid 19th century as opposed to Goethe's medieval Germany. Arbitrary and about as illuminating as his time traveling in the current ROH production of Nozze di Figaro. Which is to say that it neither added or nor detracted from the overall experience. Faust essentially rests on the gifts of its singers. When he wrote it France was able to provice the world with artists who possessed the ability to sing this music. For a brief but illuminating article on French singing I would suggest the essay by Kenneth Furie in Opera on Record I. The very first recording of Faust was in 1930 and the great Journet sang Mephisto. Vezzani was the Faust. An Italian name but from Corsica, an island that provided France with some wonderful singers.Returning to the current edition it is easy to recommend this set over the others if only because Alagna's French is native. He may not command the vocal thrust of Thill but it is a pleasure to hear the voice of a Francophone speaker. His wife, of course, is not French, but far preferable to the competition--conjugal pillow talk? Terfel takes surpring care with the language; this was evident in his performance in Hoffmann. he lacks the low notes--afterall he calls himself a bass-baritone. The role really requires a Pinza, a Siepe or a Journet. Keenlyside's Valentine is beautifully sung and as a lieder singer his care with words has always been exemplary. Siebel is Sophie Koch, also a Francophone speaker; too bad her second aria was omitted but then it usually is.Faust is not likely to regain its popularity with the public any more than Tannhauser, but it deserves to be revived and treated with respect. One whiff of irony, of course, and the work will collapse. To succeed it must be taken seriously and attract the kind of singers who can distinguish themselves in Gounod's music. In the last few years it would appear that Romeo and Juliet has overcome its second position and is now more popular with the public than Faust. I find this understandable and would rate it a better opera. First off the libretto is less ambitious. it is dramatically more taut and given the right singers i find it far more rewarding.There is one DVD of which I have heard only a small portion, the VAI performance from Tokyo with Scotto, Krauss and Ghiaurov. There is one review which is very positive, the remaing very negative focusing on the techical shortcomings of the DVD. Since I am well aware of these shortcomings and have purchased the Lucia, Traviata and Ballo I find it appalling that anyone who would purchase any of them would be unable to focus on the performance. (True the main bone of contention is the fact that the Japanesse subtitles are burned into the tape and cannot be deleted.) They reveal what has been lost in the last fifty years and while it is not possible for a Spaniard, an Italian or a Bulgarian would be able to bring French style back to life, each of these artists was a singer of great style and voice. Nothing like them exists today. The remaining DVD sets may possess some virtues but I would still opt for the newest set. It is not likely to be bested even with its shortcomings.",4,By Default it Takes the Lead,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,3920,"['cursory', 'review', 'available', 'recordings', 'and/or', 'tapings', 'Faust', 'LP', 'CD', 'DVD', 'new', '2004', 'staging', 'ROH', 'clearly', 'leading', 'contender', ""n't"", 'make', 'best', 'balance', 'sheet', 'clearly', 'black', 'was', 'understanding', 'performance', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'due', 'difficulties', 'were', 'never', 'revealed', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'initial', 'thinking', 'casting', 'being', 'shown', 'British', 'TV', 'problems', 'were', 'have', 'been', 'overcome.It', 'may', 'be', 'notes', 'try', 'might', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'director', 'Google', 'search', 'cleared', 'up', 'problem', 'David', 'McVicar', 'was', 'first', 'new', 'production', 'Faust', 'many', 'years', 'ROH', 'McVicar', 'moved', 'time', 'period', 'Gounod', 'mid', '19th', 'century', 'opposed', 'Goethe', 'medieval', 'Germany', 'Arbitrary', 'as', 'illuminating', 'time', 'traveling', 'current', 'ROH', 'production', 'Nozze', 'di', 'Figaro', 'Which', 'say', 'added', 'detracted', 'overall', 'experience', 'Faust', 'essentially', 'gifts', 'singers', 'When', 'wrote', 'France', 'was', 'able', 'provice', 'world', 'artists', 'who', 'possessed', 'ability', 'sing', 'music', 'brief', 'illuminating', 'article', 'French', 'singing', 'would', 'suggest', 'essay', 'Kenneth', 'Furie', 'Opera', 'Record', 'very', 'first', 'recording', 'Faust', 'was', '1930', 'great', 'Journet', 'sang', 'Mephisto', 'Vezzani', 'was', 'Faust', 'Italian', 'name', 'Corsica', 'island', 'provided', 'France', 'wonderful', 'singers.Returning', 'current', 'edition', 'easy', 'recommend', 'set', 'others', 'only', 'Alagna', 'French', 'native', 'may', 'not', 'command', 'vocal', 'thrust', 'Thill', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'voice', 'Francophone', 'speaker', 'wife', 'course', 'not', 'French', 'far', 'preferable', 'competition', 'conjugal', 'pillow', 'talk', 'Terfel', 'surpring', 'care', 'language', 'was', 'evident', 'performance', 'Hoffmann', 'low', 'notes', 'afterall', 'bass-baritone', 'role', 'really', 'Pinza', 'Siepe', 'Journet', 'Keenlyside', 'Valentine', 'beautifully', 'sung', 'lieder', 'singer', 'care', 'words', 'always', 'been', 'exemplary', 'Siebel', 'Sophie', 'Koch', 'also', 'Francophone', 'speaker', 'too', 'bad', 'second', 'aria', 'was', 'omitted', 'then', 'usually', 'is.Faust', 'not', 'likely', 'regain', 'popularity', 'public', 'more', 'Tannhauser', 'be', 'revived', 'treated', 'respect', 'One', 'whiff', 'irony', 'course', 'work', 'will', 'collapse', 'succeed', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'attract', 'kind', 'singers', 'who', 'can', 'distinguish', 'Gounod', 'music', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'would', 'appear', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'overcome', 'second', 'position', 'now', 'more', 'popular', 'public', 'Faust', 'find', 'understandable', 'would', 'rate', 'better', 'opera', 'First', 'libretto', 'less', 'ambitious', 'dramatically', 'more', 'taut', 'given', 'right', 'singers', 'i', 'find', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding.There', 'one', 'DVD', 'have', 'heard', 'only', 'small', 'portion', 'VAI', 'performance', 'Tokyo', 'Scotto', 'Krauss', 'Ghiaurov', 'one', 'review', 'very', 'positive', 'remaing', 'very', 'negative', 'focusing', 'techical', 'shortcomings', 'DVD', 'am', 'well', 'aware', 'shortcomings', 'have', 'purchased', 'Lucia', 'Traviata', 'Ballo', 'find', 'appalling', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'purchase', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'focus', 'performance', 'main', 'bone', 'contention', 'fact', 'Japanesse', 'subtitles', 'are', 'burned', 'tape', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'deleted', 'reveal', 'been', 'lost', 'last', 'fifty', 'years', 'not', 'possible', 'Spaniard', 'Italian', 'Bulgarian', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'bring', 'French', 'style', 'back', 'life', 'artists', 'was', 'singer', 'great', 'style', 'voice', 'Nothing', 'today', 'remaining', 'DVD', 'sets', 'may', 'possess', 'virtues', 'would', 'still', 'opt', 'newest', 'set', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'bested', 'even', 'shortcomings']",N/A

A century ago this was the most performed opera in the world. It played so often at the old Met. that it had the nickname of the ""Faustspielhaus"". I remember while growing up my Grandmother's old wind-up Victrola (played with cactus needles) playing Salud d'amout, the Jewel Song, The Soldier's Chorus etc. Even in my youth the final trio with Victoria de los Angeles was standard fare in one's record collection. Times change and so does taste. Not often done any more, there is no really good DVD available until this present one. I am thrilled to report that it is worth the wait. All the singers in all parts are top rate. And what is also great is that they can sing the beautiful French lyrics acurately and correctly. Angela Gheorghiu is an excellent Marguerite with a voice able to cope with the score with ease and act it out convincingly. Her then husband, also a French speaker Robert Alagna was just right for Faust. The perfect Devil is Bryn Terfel. He was certainly enjoying being the evil influence. A great actor to boot. Simon Keenlyside made Valentin a memorable character. A lieder singer, his diction was perfect. Even the part of Siebel as perfoprmed by Sophie Kock was memorable and Della Jones whom I know from dozens of Opera Rara recordings did credit to Marthe. It was nice to see her at last. I am so leery of ""Euro-trash"" opera directors that I was afraid when I saw that the time-place had been moved, but it all worked well as set in Gounod's Paris. The conductor Pappano took things along at a proper clip and there were no dull moments. And yes, tears of thrill filled my eyes at the final trio. The production did  away with most of the old bombast and added new dimensions. I loved Terfel in drag and the ballet literally from hell.

1371257,A3JV7KL1ECLZB8,B003Y58CKI,I. Giles,"[5, 5]","This recording of Faust, made at the Royal Opera in 2004, is essentially a traditional production and with believable settings within the context of the story. Importantly it a features a top calibre cast on top form under the expert baton of Antonio Pappano.The main four characters are particularly impressive as one might hope for or expect. The larger than life role of Mephistopheles is ideally cast with Bryn Terfel physically dominating in a central role that enables him to make the most of his imposing presence. As he has demonstrated in his portrayal of Puccini's Scarpio, Terfel is very suited to darker roles and in this opera he has plenty of opportunity to show this to telling dramatic effect with convincing acting allied to an effortless mastery of the vocal challenges.Simon Keenlyside is equally fine as a singer/actor and he brings an equally strong portrayal to his characterisation of Valentin. He is still very much in his prime, vocally and physically and this makes for a convincing interpretation of his military role.Angela Gheorghiu brings her customary intensity to the role of Marguerite which dramatically must encompass the decline from innocence to insanity and then a rise to final redemption. This is not easy to portray convincingly and it is to Gheorghiu's credit that she is able to deliver these dramatic challenges so well while still completely delivering on the vocal aspects of the role.However, the most central role of all must be that of the title role of Faust. This brings a remarkable performance from Roberto Alagna who delivers what must be one of his finest performances to date. He too is fully in control of the vocal demands of the part and also of the shifting dramatic nuances of the role. He is also in good physical shape and is able to bring an extra dimension of genuinely fit athleticism to the portrayal.The supporting roles of Siebel, Marthe and Wagner are well delivered by Sophie Koch, Della Jones and Matthew Rose respectively and Pappano is on top form as conductor. The orchestra is very fine and responds to every demand without fail. The choreography and dancers are suitably effective as appropriate as is the chorus contribution.The booklet provides an interesting description and coverage of historical background detail.The camera work is fully involving but the predominately dark settings have led to rather over-contrasty imaging which might be the result of over-sharpening at the production stage of the processing. This is the weakest part of this product. The sound is excellent on the other hand and is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo options.Overall this is a very strong portrayal of Faust given by a top quality cast and in a believable setting. The recording is sonically good but the imaging could be described as a touch disappointing for 2004 standards. This might be rectified on a future reprocessing if the problem is simply that of over-sharpening. However it is also possible that this would not be a matter of concern for those not involved professionally with photography.Musically and dramatically this clearly gave the audience present on 19th June 2004 much satisfaction. I would suggest that it is equally likely that most purchasers of this disc would feel the same way and that it is certainly worth seriously considering as a potential purchase.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one.

1371258,A2GOTY2STOMEAU,B003Y58CKI,John G. Gleeson Sr.,"[20, 21]","My love of Gounod's Faust dates back to 1964, when, newly married, I introduced my wife to Verdi and she introduced me to Faust. Both loves have lasted for 47 years, I'm happy to say. As I recollect, I have seen Faust twice onstage, and have several recordings, the first of which feattured the awesome combination of Gedda, De Los Angeles and Christoff. But I yearned for a DVD, because, after all, opera is meant to be seen as well as heard: it's theatre.The discs previously available simply did not interest me, and the reviews underscored the fact that they were seriously flawed.So it was a ""no brainer"" to jump on this one when it came out, and it remains one of the best operas on my shelf. It is not only splendid from a vocal perspective, but from a dramatic one as well.One example: when Faust is transformed from an old man to a young one, Alagna first feels his face in amazement, and then does cartwheels onstage. I cannot imagine a better dramatization of his exuberance than that!Faust is a role that fits Alagna's spinto tenor voice perfectly, and being a French speaker, his diction is perfect. Similarly, Ms. Georghiu's lyric soprano is tailor made for the role of Marguerite, and it shows, consistantly. Both are vibrant stage presences, so the acting is also consistantly well above average for opera.Bryn Terfel sings the role of Mephistopheles as well as one could wish, but it appears that the stage director declined to make him really  ...  well, ""devilish"". The only time he really gets into that aspect of the character is in Act I when Faust, having second thoughts about all this, tells him to beat feet: ""Va t'en!' Then Terfel gets really into character with a ""Don't mess with Mr. Bad!"" look. I missed the more diabolical interpretation of the role, but that's a minor issue.As noted by other reviewers, Simon Keenlyside is the definitive Valentin, and Mesdames Koch and Jones sing and perform at a very high level of excellenceStaging, chorus & orchestra are all first rate with Maestro Pappano doing an excellent job from the pit.The disc is what I have come to expect from EMI: crisp, clear, focused video, and the DTS surround system that lets my neighbors know what I am watching.Faust should be an essential in any opera library, and this version is a perfect rendition of the work.Enjoy!!",5,A Near Flawless Performance!!,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,2327,"['love', 'Gounod', 'Faust', 'back', '1964', 'when', 'newly', 'married', 'introduced', 'wife', 'Verdi', 'introduced', 'Faust', 'loves', 'have', 'lasted', '47', 'years', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'recollect', 'have', 'seen', 'Faust', 'twice', 'onstage', 'have', 'several', 'recordings', 'first', 'feattured', 'awesome', 'combination', 'Gedda', 'De', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Christoff', 'yearned', 'DVD', 'opera', 'meant', 'be', 'seen', 'as', 'well', 'heard', 'theatre.The', 'discs', 'previously', 'available', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'interest', 'reviews', 'underscored', 'fact', 'were', 'seriously', 'flawed.So', 'was', 'brainer', 'jump', 'one', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'operas', 'shelf', 'not', 'only', 'splendid', 'vocal', 'perspective', 'dramatic', 'one', 'well.One', 'example', 'when', 'Faust', 'transformed', 'old', 'man', 'young', 'one', 'Alagna', 'first', 'face', 'amazement', 'then', 'cartwheels', 'onstage', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'better', 'dramatization', 'exuberance', 'Faust', 'role', 'Alagna', 'spinto', 'tenor', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'being', 'French', 'speaker', 'diction', 'perfect', 'Similarly', 'Ms.', 'Georghiu', 'lyric', 'soprano', 'tailor', 'made', 'role', 'Marguerite', 'consistantly', 'are', 'vibrant', 'stage', 'presences', 'acting', 'also', 'consistantly', 'well', 'average', 'opera.Bryn', 'Terfel', 'role', 'Mephistopheles', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'could', 'wish', 'stage', 'director', 'declined', 'make', 'really', 'well', 'devilish', 'only', 'time', 'really', 'aspect', 'character', 'Act', 'when', 'Faust', 'having', 'second', 'thoughts', 'beat', 'feet', 'Va', ""t'en"", 'Then', 'Terfel', 'really', 'character', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mess', 'Mr', 'Bad', 'look', 'missed', 'more', 'diabolical', 'interpretation', 'role', 'minor', 'issue.As', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewers', 'Simon', 'Keenlyside', 'definitive', 'Valentin', 'Mesdames', 'Koch', 'Jones', 'sing', 'perform', 'very', 'high', 'level', 'excellenceStaging', 'chorus', 'orchestra', 'are', 'first', 'rate', 'Maestro', 'Pappano', 'doing', 'excellent', 'job', 'pit.The', 'disc', 'what', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'EMI', 'crisp', 'clear', 'focused', 'video', 'DTS', 'surround', 'system', 'neighbors', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'watching.Faust', 'should', 'be', 'essential', 'opera', 'library', 'version', 'perfect', 'rendition', 'work.Enjoy']",N/A

It was wonderful & I really enjoyed the staging & the singing but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that you could find some of the scenes a bit offensive if you are more conservative in your viewing.  There's a scene where women lick blood off of a ""bleeding"" crucifix - I get that it was representing the devil's doing but some may find it a bit much.  What I had trouble with was the scene where they had the talents of their incredible ballet company completely wasted by having the lot of them rolling around on the ground having pretty graphic simulated sex.  I just thought it went further than it had to & I wanted to see the dancers DANCE, not roll around on the ground.

1371262,A3A6G37LQKNOB9,B003Y58CKI,Michael A. Kalm,"[15, 18]","Gounod's Faust has always been a dilemma for me.  Some of the most sumptuous, melodious music ever written, saddled with a sappy Catholic morality play, so bizarre compared to Goethe's Faust or Boito's faithful Mefistofele.  And now, (or at least 2004 when this was broadcast,) an answer to the dilemma - Faust totally reimagined by the Royal Opera Covent Garden to be dark, brooding, blurring definitions of heaven, hell and reality on earth, giving the tale a grit that is like the 19th Century answer to Lez Miz, only with better music. I mean, the Skater's waltz to a Cabaret striptease?  Now we're talking.  There is one delightful and thoughtful surprise after another.Then top that off with a supreme cast that seems to have been inspired to even greater heights by the production.  Terfel as the Devil - a focus for genuine evil here, no cartoon character, no urbane Devil out of Bernard Shaw.  Not that he doesn't have charm, but pure evil.  What happens to Valentin is particulary striking (no spoilers here,) but he can't say he wasn't warned.  Alagna brings a passionate ferocity and athleticism as well as hitting all the notes (musical and emotional - from the dying old man to the exuberance of youth, to the depravity of the drug addicted.  And finally Gheorgiu - How I loved to hear recordings of Joan Sutherland doing this role, thankful that I didn't have to look at her.  And now Gheorgiu, singing full out with total gorgeous beauty, in her voice and in her appearance.  It just doesn't get any better than that.I'll just add that with singing actresses like Gheorgiu, Garanca, Netrebko and Dessay, I wonder that opera audiences aren't growing in leaps and bounds.

Mossel,"[16, 18]","Considering the performance history of this opera, one would assume that there would be a wide selection of visual performances from which to choose. However, I have been waiting a long time for a DVD of Faust to use in a course I teach on opera and am delighted that this performance has finally been released. It was worth the wait. The cast is outstanding and the production concept very interesting. Not only is the ballet included, it conveys the utter perversity of Mephistopheles' domain better than in any other production I have seen. Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna are superb as Marguerite and Faust. Her final aria is particularly moving. Simon Keenlyside, whose Hamlet is the current gold standard, is always commanding and one wishes that Valentin, and Sophie Koch's Siebel, had longer roles.
