1279899,A1A1JEZQUFPVID,B002NN7EXS,C. Barker,"[0, 0]","The ""thirtysomething"" folks during the 1980's, aka (Baby Boomers), are probably the greatest generation we have ever had... They greatly outnumber the generation I am in called simple generation ""X"" being born towards the end of 1967.. I missed out on the flower power, The Beatles, even knowing much about what was going on with the war over in Vietnam.  The Baby Boomers brought my generation MTV, and about every modern invention that we have right now..  This show sheds light on the greatest generation... Thirtysomething tv series makes you forget you are watching actors, who are reading lines written by writers... These actors are acting from their hearts, and therefore it speaks to all of our hearts...  You believe every word this great ensemble cast says.  You feel their pain, and their joy.  I truly think this is the greatest series ever produced.. and I'm a fan of both the Dick Van Dyke show and the Mary Tyler Moore show and the Waltons.  The thirtysomething cast will always remain thirtysomething to us..  Although now they are close to 60 something.. Who would think that 25 years after this show began, we would be watching the entire series on DVD's and writing about it on amazon.com  ..  Life was grand in the 1980's.. and this series captures all of it.  To paraphrase Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America, if Seinfield is the show about nothing, than thirtysomething is the show about everything.  They had the perfect cast, the perfect everything.  Why isn't the cast and show honored on the Tvland awards, for a groundbreaking series.. It surely was and is...",5,Totally Awesome!,1335744000,"04 30, 2012",2012,1589,"['thirtysomething', 'folks', '1980', 'aka', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'are', 'probably', 'greatest', 'generation', 'have', 'ever', 'had', 'greatly', 'outnumber', 'generation', 'am', 'called', 'simple', 'generation', 'X', 'being', 'born', 'end', '1967..', 'missed', 'out', 'flower', 'power', 'Beatles', 'even', 'knowing', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'brought', 'generation', 'MTV', 'modern', 'invention', 'have', 'right', 'now..', 'show', 'light', 'greatest', 'generation', 'Thirtysomething', 'tv', 'series', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'reading', 'lines', 'written', 'writers', 'actors', 'are', 'acting', 'hearts', 'hearts', 'believe', 'word', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'feel', 'pain', 'joy', 'truly', 'think', 'greatest', 'series', 'ever', 'produced..', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Dick', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'show', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'Waltons', 'thirtysomething', 'cast', 'will', 'always', 'remain', 'thirtysomething', 'us..', 'now', 'are', 'close', '60', 'something..', 'Who', 'would', 'think', '25', 'years', 'show', 'began', 'would', 'be', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'writing', 'amazon.com', '..', 'Life', 'was', 'grand', ""1980's.."", 'series', 'paraphrase', 'Diane', 'Sawyer', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'Seinfield', 'show', 'nothing', 'thirtysomething', 'show', 'everything', 'had', 'perfect', 'cast', 'perfect', 'everything', 'Why', ""n't"", 'cast', 'show', 'honored', 'Tvland', 'awards', 'groundbreaking', 'series..', 'surely', 'was']",thirtysomething: Season 2
1279900,A1KVF4MKAGF67P,B002NN7EXS,Diane L. Mechlinski,"[0, 1]","I used to watch Thirtysomething on TV when it was a new, ongoing series. Back then, I was the age of all the show's adult characters and could relate to their issues, enjoying the episodes and the honesty with which they were presented. Now, I just completed watching the entire DVD set of Season One. I had bought it so as to share with my now grown daughter. Both of us loved watching the show! I enjoyed it because it was a flashback to me of the years ago when I first watched the series, and I still liked it now. The characters are real, their problems are real and ones you can truly identify with (not some flimsy TV problems that one could never imagine happening in real life) and most of all, my daughter could relate to them as well - and that's something when you bring back a series from a couple decades ago and it still has the same strong appeal for today's young adults as it did when it was originally broadcast.There is a mixture of all kinds of REAL characters in Thirtysomething. You've got the struggling couples (Michael and Hope who are happy but still deal with marriage issues; Nancy and Elliot who separate), infidelity, quirky Melissa, finicky Ellyn, continuous relationship flaws and fears of not finding ""the"" one for Ellyn and Melissa as well as Gary from the male perspective. Issues of parenthood and career - you name it, they address it. The time period may be a couple decades off, but the problems are unique yet the same as we're dealing with today.I can't wait to continue with Season Two and onward!  I recommend this series highly.",5,Excellent Flashback of a Terrific Series!,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,1573,"['used', 'watch', 'Thirtysomething', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'new', 'ongoing', 'series', 'Back', 'then', 'was', 'age', 'show', 'adult', 'characters', 'could', 'relate', 'issues', 'enjoying', 'episodes', 'honesty', 'were', 'presented', 'Now', 'just', 'completed', 'watching', 'entire', 'DVD', 'set', 'Season', 'One', 'had', 'bought', 'so', 'share', 'now', 'grown', 'daughter', 'loved', 'watching', 'show', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'flashback', 'years', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'series', 'still', 'liked', 'now', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'problems', 'are', 'real', 'ones', 'can', 'truly', 'identify', 'not', 'flimsy', 'TV', 'problems', 'one', 'could', 'never', 'imagine', 'happening', 'real', 'life', 'most', 'daughter', 'could', 'relate', 'as', 'well', 'something', 'when', 'bring', 'back', 'series', 'couple', 'decades', 'ago', 'still', 'same', 'strong', 'appeal', 'today', 'young', 'adults', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast.There', 'mixture', 'kinds', 'REAL', 'characters', 'Thirtysomething', ""'ve"", 'got', 'struggling', 'couples', 'Michael', 'Hope', 'who', 'are', 'happy', 'still', 'deal', 'marriage', 'issues', 'Nancy', 'Elliot', 'who', 'separate', 'infidelity', 'quirky', 'Melissa', 'finicky', 'Ellyn', 'continuous', 'relationship', 'flaws', 'fears', 'not', 'finding', 'one', 'Ellyn', 'Melissa', 'as', 'well', 'Gary', 'male', 'perspective', 'Issues', 'parenthood', 'career', 'name', 'address', 'time', 'period', 'may', 'be', 'couple', 'decades', 'problems', 'are', 'unique', 'yet', 'same', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'today.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'continue', 'Season', 'Two', 'onward', 'recommend', 'series', 'highly']",thirtysomething: Season 2

Recurring, complex characters, Miles Drentell and Susanna Hart, were introduced. Episodes came to rely less on plot, allowing viewers opportunity for introspection, a strength of the series that became one of its hallmarks.  Although bonus features are not as abundant as on the season one package, the three included here (profiles of Miles and Susannah, and a feature ""W.G.
