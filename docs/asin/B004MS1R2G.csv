A bad blonde dye job and boob job does not make up for the fact that she is 30 pounds overweight and approaching thirty in show business.The plot is just bad, bad, bad. It is poorly written with bad dialogue to match the bad acting. The movie moves slowly. It is full of stereotypes that go nowhere. The textbook dishonest record company is a predictable part of this uninteresting plot. The movie is full of platitudes and sappy scenes like her singing to a group of down's syndrome children.Throughout, it seems they dressed her from the $5 rack at forever 21. If you are a size 10 and near thirty, you don't look good in cheap size 6 spandex/polyester clothes for seventeen year olds.

After leaving home a woman who wants to be a singer tries her luck in Nashville.  She soon realizes that the price of fame is not what she thought.  I am a big George Strait fan but was not a huge fan of the original apart from the soundtrack.  This one was over the top cheesy.  George Strait is in this one too, but playing himself.
