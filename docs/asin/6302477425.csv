314415,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302477425,Acute Observer,"[7, 10]","The film is based on the 1958 book by Alexander Klein, and is more dramatic. Erickson was never suspected, and did not have to flee. He did help win the war by reporting about Germany's synthetic oil production, which also produced munitions and rubber. Strategic bombing reduced oil production, and the munitions as well. The lack of oil and gasoline reduced the mobility of the troops and tanks sent against the Normandy Invasion, and on the Eastern Front. To avoid Allied bombings, some factories were sent to eastern Germany; these were soon overrun by Soviet forces. The lack of gasoline meant less training for fighter pilots, which created severe losses against better trained Allied pilots. It also meant less break-in time for aircraft engines, and more failures in flight. The lack of munitions resulted in fewer and less effective AA shells. In the last months of the war Germany had difficulties in moving troops, tanks, and supplies. Germany began the war with the mechanized Blitzkrieg, and ended with horse-drawn transportation. Chapter 43 and Appendix B of the book explain how strategic bombing helped win the war.Eric Erickson had many years' experience in the oil business when he was recruited into intelligence work in Dec 1939. He cultivated a pro-Nazi outlook, then traveled to Germany to buy oil and pay with Swedish iron ore. He noticed wartime food shortages in Sept 1941, and the newspapers reported the execution of traitors (8) and spies (5) as if this was a common occurrence. Consider this question: Goering takes Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels for an airplane ride; if the plane crashes, who is saved? The answer is: the German people. Telling this joke would get you shot! (Have you heard the more recent version?)Erickson noticed the effect of terror bombing the civilian population: it strengthened morale and the people's will to resist! It was more than immoral, it wasn't cost-effective. He traveled to the many synthetic oil plants, taking note of defenses, and production capability. He never wrote anything down, just passed the information orally to his many contacts. He was debriefed upon his return to Sweden by Allied military intelligence.Erickson was able to travel freely because of his scheme to build a synthetic oil plant in neutral Sweden. It could not be bombed, and could ship oil to Germany. The Nazi rulers also appreciated the importance of investing their loot in a neutral country. JC Masterman also noted that personal honesty of the British helped defeat German greed in the area of espionage.",5,The Importance of Oil,1038960000,"12 4, 2002",2002,2554,"['film', 'based', '1958', 'book', 'Alexander', 'Klein', 'more', 'dramatic', 'Erickson', 'was', 'never', 'suspected', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'flee', 'did', 'help', 'win', 'war', 'reporting', 'Germany', 'synthetic', 'oil', 'production', 'also', 'produced', 'munitions', 'rubber', 'Strategic', 'bombing', 'reduced', 'oil', 'production', 'munitions', 'well', 'lack', 'oil', 'gasoline', 'reduced', 'mobility', 'troops', 'tanks', 'sent', 'Normandy', 'Invasion', 'Eastern', 'Front', 'avoid', 'Allied', 'bombings', 'factories', 'were', 'sent', 'eastern', 'Germany', 'were', 'soon', 'overrun', 'Soviet', 'forces', 'lack', 'gasoline', 'meant', 'less', 'training', 'fighter', 'pilots', 'created', 'severe', 'losses', 'better', 'trained', 'Allied', 'pilots', 'also', 'meant', 'less', 'break-in', 'time', 'aircraft', 'engines', 'more', 'failures', 'flight', 'lack', 'munitions', 'resulted', 'fewer', 'less', 'effective', 'AA', 'shells', 'last', 'months', 'war', 'Germany', 'had', 'difficulties', 'moving', 'troops', 'tanks', 'supplies', 'Germany', 'began', 'war', 'mechanized', 'Blitzkrieg', 'ended', 'horse-drawn', 'transportation', 'Chapter', '43', 'Appendix', 'B', 'book', 'explain', 'how', 'strategic', 'bombing', 'helped', 'win', 'war.Eric', 'Erickson', 'had', 'many', 'years', 'experience', 'oil', 'business', 'when', 'was', 'recruited', 'intelligence', 'work', 'Dec', '1939', 'cultivated', 'pro-Nazi', 'outlook', 'then', 'traveled', 'Germany', 'buy', 'oil', 'pay', 'Swedish', 'iron', 'ore', 'noticed', 'wartime', 'food', 'shortages', 'Sept', '1941', 'newspapers', 'reported', 'execution', 'traitors', '8', 'spies', '5', 'was', 'common', 'occurrence', 'Consider', 'question', 'Goering', 'Hitler', 'Himmler', 'Goebbels', 'airplane', 'ride', 'plane', 'crashes', 'who', 'saved', 'answer', 'German', 'people', 'Telling', 'joke', 'would', 'get', 'shot', 'Have', 'heard', 'more', 'recent', 'version', 'Erickson', 'noticed', 'effect', 'terror', 'bombing', 'civilian', 'population', 'strengthened', 'morale', 'people', 'will', 'resist', 'was', 'more', 'immoral', 'was', ""n't"", 'cost-effective', 'traveled', 'many', 'synthetic', 'oil', 'plants', 'taking', 'note', 'defenses', 'production', 'capability', 'never', 'wrote', 'anything', 'down', 'just', 'passed', 'information', 'orally', 'many', 'contacts', 'was', 'debriefed', 'return', 'Sweden', 'Allied', 'military', 'intelligence.Erickson', 'was', 'able', 'travel', 'freely', 'scheme', 'build', 'synthetic', 'oil', 'plant', 'neutral', 'Sweden', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'bombed', 'could', 'ship', 'oil', 'Germany', 'Nazi', 'rulers', 'also', 'appreciated', 'importance', 'investing', 'loot', 'neutral', 'country', 'JC', 'Masterman', 'also', 'noted', 'personal', 'honesty', 'British', 'helped', 'defeat', 'German', 'greed', 'area', 'espionage']",N/A

It has a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and the movie description didn't tell me enough.I was glad I bought it, and watched it, for it is one of the finest William Holden performances I've seen, and it is one of the most suspenseful movies, war or otherwise, I have seen.This is not a standard war movie; it is not filled with combat, tanks, and glorious battle scenes. Instead, it is a compelling espionage yarn that is based on true events. At times the suspense is unbearable as William Holden's charcter faces capture by the German gestapo time and again. The ending is truly satisfying and inspiring.While the movie starts a little slow, it gears up and grabs you by the throat, heart, and the pit of your stomach. The standard war movie romance is not standard after all, as you will find out. All the actors are wonderful, but William Holden stands out.  I understand at the time he made this movie he had not had a hit in some time. He redeems himself marvelously in this film. His character is multi-layered and wholly human, at first self-serving, then later serving the greater cause.A combination spy/war thriller, you will find yourself rivited to the screen and the over two hour run time will fly by.

314422,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,6302477425,C. O. DeRiemer,"[3, 3]","Think of The Counterfeit Traitor as a sprawling but engrossing three-part espionage novel with a daunting number of pages to get through. If you're like me, you'll have a good time. In fact, I think The Counterfeit Traitor, even with all its subsections and all of its 240 minutes, is one of the best of the WWII sagas. The hero is an adult, and director-writer George Seaton treats the audience as adults, too.It's the story of Eric Erickson (William Holden), a Swede who is a successful oil trader. Sweden is neutral and Erickson makes money trading with the allies as well as with Germany. In a bit of ruthless manipulation, a British intelligence agent named Collins (Hugh Griffin) begins to ruin Erickson's reputation, then offers to clear him if Erickson, who is able to easily travel between Stockholm and Germany, gathers information on Germany's war effort and delivers it back to him. Erickson has little choice. Even so, to be effective he has to fool the Gestapo into believing he's genuine. Soon, in Sweden, he's convincing friends that he believes in Nazi Germany. In Germany, he uses blackmail to gather inside information from his German business friends. He has few illusions. He resents being forced into this double game. He loses a lot of self-esteem as he disappoints his Swedish friends and manipulates his German friends. Not only is he at risk every time he steps foot in Germany, he is putting in the shadow of the hangman's noose the Germans he has been working with. The only thing that changes his mind is an act of random brutality he witnesses at a German factory that uses Polish laborers. A man picked at random from a crowd is strung up on a hoist and strangles to death while his co-workers watch. Says a colleague of Erickson's, ""You can read about a hundred atrocities, hear about a thousand, but you only have to see one.""Erickson's contact in Berlin is Marianne Mollendorf (Lilli Palmer), a well-connected wife of an Army colonel. The game they play gets riskier with every visit Erickson makes. She knows the worth of what she is doing. When Erikson realizes the importance, too, it's not long before love follows.The movie is too long and could easily lose 30 minutes here and there. A lot of those minutes involve the inner angst of Erickson and Mollendorf. Their growing love is believable; their dialogue often has `Hollywood' written all over it. There's some preaching, but not too much, and since most of it is delivered by Palmer it's at least bearable. She was not only a beautiful woman, she was a fine actress whose intelligence was much of her attractiveness. To my knowledge, she never played a dumb woman in a long career. On the other hand, watching an 11-year-old boy try to destroy Holden as Erickson is unnerving. Watching Holden try to destroy an 11-year-old boy is satisfying.The strength of the movie, from my point of view, is in its portrayal of blackmail, the application of leverage and the corruption by both sides to achieve their goals. This isn't a case of moral equivalency, just the way wars work, There are no armed battles, shoot `em ups or breakouts, just a lot of slowly building tension, the accumulation of small mistakes and emotional exhaustion, and a terrible moment of betrayed faith and the consequences that arise from it. That leaves us with the last half of the movie and one exciting moment after another. Erickson goes back to Germany one last time to retrieve a critical document. This time he finds himself picked up by the Gestapo. His escape isn't pretty or easy, but it's a great ride...not for the derring do but for the tension and the intricacies of his escape, made possible by the many people who help him. If you never thought you'd become emotional about bicycles, you might surprise yourself.So we have Erickson's recruitment and first missions, Erickson and Mollendorf's work, their relationship and the consequences, and Erickson's complicated escape. The Counterfeit Traitor sprawls, but it's held together by William Holden's performance. He's a reluctant hero, then a committed one, but without bravado. The movie is an intelligent espionage thriller that owes a lot to Holden's contained, intelligent portrayal.The DVD movie looks just fine. There are no extras.",4,"A sprawling, satisfying WWII espionage thriller.

Sweden's neutrality and his numerous connections allowed Holden unencumbered access to Germany.  This status puts Holden in a compromising position courtesy of Allied intelligence.  Threatened with the loss of his lucrative business, the opportunistic Holden is coerced by Agent Collins played by Hugh Griffith into working undercover for the Allies.Under the pretext of constructing a Nazi operated oil refinery on Swedish soil, Holden is bequeathed a Gestapo issued passport to travel around Germany.  His dangerous mission is to relay back to Griffith sensitve wartime information and to recruit anti Nazi German industrialists to the Allied cause.  His German contact Frau Mollendorf, is a highly regarded German socialite played by Prussian born Lilli Palmer.  Together they provide crucial intelligence to aid in the war effort.Holden whose bogus pro-Nazi stance in Sweden has alienated his friends and eventually his wife, soons falls in love with Palmer.  The Gestapo noose, however, is closing around their necks.

While in Hamburg his cover gets blown and he's nearly caught.  Using underground contacts, he undergoes a harrowing escape from the Third Reich through Denmark to make his way back to Sweden with the critical information.Director George Seaton puts an emotive touch on his portrayal of those who sacrificed so much for freedom from tyranny.  He focuses on the scoundrels leading the Nazi party and the inhuman means by which they formulate their racist policies.

William Holden is excellent as Eric Erickson, the American who became a Swedish citizen, then a wealthy businessman (with his own oil company), then became a spy for the Allies! Despite what the movie portrays, the real Erickson freely agreed to work for the Allies but refused any pay & at his own suggestion was put on the blacklist so that he could be a more convincing ""pro-Nazi"" businessman. Holden is great, but Lilli Palmer is also outstanding as his spy contact & love interest. Everything about this classic is perfect: the scenery, the nail-biting suspense, the beautiful music, & the flawless cast. By the way, a very young Klaus Kinski has a cameo as a Jewish refugee.

314427,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,6302477425,D. Hartley,"[5, 5]","Another brilliant William Holden performance highlights this thinking person's WWII adventure. The screenplay is based on the true-life memoirs of a Swedish businessman who agreed to ""pose"" as a Nazi sympathizer in order to help locate strategic industrial bombing targets within Gemany for Allied intelligence. The movie eschews the ""Where Eagles Dare"" approach and opts for a more realistic, soul-searching examination of how human beings, regardless of what ""side"" they are on, behave during times of conflict - closer to ""All Quiet On The Western Front"". The movie does have a fair amount of suspenseful and tense moments, but there is more ""inner"" conflict going on with Holden's character as he is is forced to challenge his own moral and ethical code the deeper he falls into intrigue. An obvious comparison would be with the namesake character of ""Schindler's List""- the initially ""neutral"" businessman who comes to realize that there are some things worth fighting for, personal consequences be damned. There is a moment at the end of ""Counterfeit Traitor"" where someone notices Holden is wearing a black armband, and asks him who it is for. Holden pauses a beat, and then says ""It is for...so many."" It is one of the most beautifully played and moving codas I have ever seen in a war film, and a subtle tribute to all the people who lost thier lives in WWII.

Erikson, an ex-patriot American turned Swedish citizen, is an industrialist blackmailed into spying for the Allies.  As a petroleum importer from neutral Sweden, he is able to access and catalog the Reich's oil injustry and pass along targets to the Allies.Throughout the film, we witness the gradual change in Erikson, portrayed masterfully by William Holden, as he tranforms from coerced Allied operative to willing spy.COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR assembled a great cast and was filmed on location in (then) West Berlin, Hamburg, Copenhagen, and Stockholm.  Look for some familiar military film regulars in COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR including a very blonde Wolfgang Preiss (The Longest Day, Anzio, Raid on Rommel) and Werner Peters (The Battle of the Bulge).

314442,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6302477425,Lee Armstrong,"[6, 6]","George Seaton directed this film and wrote the screenplay based on a book by Alexander Klein.  In his career, Seaton was nominated for a directing Oscar for ""The Country Girl"" in 1954 & won screenplay Oscars for that film and ""The Miracle on 34th Street.""  In this film, he does a masterful job of telling a very complex story, keeping it clear and compelling.William Holden stars as Eric Erickson, an American who renounced citizenship for Sweden.  Holden does a good job with quiet intensity that appears natural throughout.  Holden won his Oscar for ""Stalag 17"" in 1953.  His last nomination was for ""Network"" in 1976.  Although he died in 1981 from a head injury sustained during a fall, in this film he dashes around Germany and Denmark with athletic grace.Hugh Griffith plays the sarcastic British agent Collins who snares Erickson into working espionage to get off a blacklist.  Collins' respect for Erickson increases as Eric becomes increasingly dedicated to the cause.  Griffith won his supporting Oscar for ""Ben Hur"" in 1959.  In this film, his bravado makes his screen time memorable.Lilli Palmer plays the German woman Marianne who hobnobs at Nazi gatherings.  Some of her scenes with Holden read a bit cliche almost 50 years later.  But her masterful presence and her final moments before the bullets fly are golden.The location shooting in Stockholm, Copenhagen and Berlin is almost worth the price of admission.  This is a delightful film just to look at.  The Copenhagen scene with the flood of bicyclists is a classic screen moment.  Although it was not an award-winning film, ""The Counterfeit Traitor"" is a solid spy tale with excellent performances.

Erickson is an oil trader and as Sweden was neutral, he didn't care where the oil came from.  This gives Erickson access to many German cities.  He is blackmailed by British Agents and forced to spy for them.  After seeing the brutal treatment of some Jewish prisoners, he goes from reluctant spy to eager spy.  He proposes to build a refinery in Germany.  This allows him to cultivate important relationships and recruit his own network.  As the Nazi's take firmer control, his job becomes more risky.  Eventually, he is uncovered and must escape back to Sweden.This is based on actual people.  Holden was best known as the other man in a string of films during the 50's (Born Yesterday, The Country Girl).  In Counterfeit Traitor, Holden confirmed that he could headline a film.  Lili Palmer plays his German contact.  Palmer is at her most luminous in this film.  She had a character with substance and she knew it.This is a fine film about espionage.

Eric not only humors the optimal negotiator, he also promises him a share in the company he is forming and charmingly pays him the money lost in weekly bridge games...Eric begins his frequent business trips to Germany with a gala reception during which he makes contact with another agent, an irresistible woman with whom he is to pretend to have an affair, Mariana (Lilli Palmer).Mariana, wife of a high-ranking German officer, is both an idealist and an efficient spy... She would embrace and kiss Eric for the sake of any Gestapo man trailing them and then shake hands before getting down to the business of encoding messages... Her shock at Eric's selfish reasons for being a spy contrasted with her own, a firmly loyal belief in the Catholic religion to fight the Anti-Christ, Hitler... In perhaps the film's most moving scene, she tells Eric that 'one must not think of the war simply in terms of hundreds of tanks and thousand of planes and units of men, like some sort of wrestling match on a gigantic scale... but in terms of a single truck on its way to a concentration camp and what's shivering inside in.'Unlike many other spy films set during the war, 'The Counterfeit Traitor' stressed the personal and emotional cost of espionage: Eric, the spy-against-his-will, had not only to forsake his wife and friends who were upset by his apparent Nazi sympathies, he had also to witness Nazi atrocities...George Seaton's 'The Counterfeit Traitor' is sobering to a remarkable degree, mostly when Marianne discovers she has given her confession not to a priest; the questioning of Eric in Berlin's basement cell; Hitler Youth member Hans Holtz stealing Eric's briefcase with incriminating letter; and Eric's confrontation with Gestapo man Jaeger...",4,Sobering to a remarkable degree...,1166832000,"12 23, 2006",2006,3181,"['Born', 'Brooklyn', 'Eric', 'Erickson', 'William', 'Holden', 'naturalized', 'Swedish', 'businessman', 'neutral', 'enough', 'deal', 'Germans', 'Allies', 'name', 'published', 'list', 'Nazi', 'sympathizers', 'Shocked', 'angry', 'soon', 'inclusion', 'list', 'device', 'force', 'work', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'representative', 'sarcastic', 'Collins', 'Hugh', 'Griffith', 'Stockholm', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'not', 'only', 'blackmail', 'having', 'conversation', 'taped', 'enforce', 'Eric', 'cooperation', 'Swedes', 'strongly', 'value', 'neutrality', 'Disarmed', 'as', 'well', 'astonished', 'Collins', 'cynicism', 'Eric', 'agree', 'become', 'spy', 'spy', 'master', 'courses', 'luncheon', 'would', ""'deal"", 'thieves', 'liars', 'procurers', 'traitors', 'sluts', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'Not', 'only', 'must', 'Eric', 'supply', 'information', 'German', 'oil', 'industry', 'also', 'act', 'part', 'someone', 'Allied', 'blacklist', 'real', 'sympathies', 'Eric', 'must', 'make', 'spiteful', 'remarks', 'Allies', 'more', 'importantly', 'drop', 'sneering', 'remarks', 'Jews', 'insult', 'publicly', 'Jewish', 'best', 'friend', 'hearing', 'German', 'ambassador', 'friendship', 'Third', 'Reich', 'diplomat', 'needed', 'secure', 'official', 'sanction', 'Eric', 'plan', 'construct', 'German', 'oil', 'refineries', 'Sweden', 'means', 'secure', 'information', 'Allies', 'want', 'Eric', 'not', 'only', 'optimal', 'negotiator', 'also', 'share', 'company', 'forming', 'charmingly', 'money', 'lost', 'weekly', 'bridge', 'games', 'Eric', 'frequent', 'business', 'trips', 'Germany', 'gala', 'reception', 'contact', 'agent', 'irresistible', 'woman', 'whom', 'pretend', 'have', 'affair', 'Mariana', 'Lilli', 'Palmer', '.Mariana', 'wife', 'high-ranking', 'German', 'officer', 'idealist', 'efficient', 'spy', 'would', 'embrace', 'kiss', 'Eric', 'sake', 'Gestapo', 'man', 'trailing', 'then', 'shake', 'hands', 'getting', 'down', 'business', 'encoding', 'messages', 'shock', 'Eric', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'being', 'spy', 'contrasted', 'own', 'firmly', 'loyal', 'belief', 'Catholic', 'religion', 'fight', 'Anti-Christ', 'Hitler', 'perhaps', 'film', 'most', 'moving', 'scene', 'Eric', ""'one"", 'must', 'not', 'think', 'war', 'simply', 'terms', 'hundreds', 'tanks', 'thousand', 'planes', 'units', 'men', 'sort', 'wrestling', 'match', 'gigantic', 'scale', 'terms', 'single', 'truck', 'way', 'concentration', 'camp', 'what', 'shivering', 'inside', 'many', 'other', 'spy', 'films', 'set', 'war', 'Counterfeit', 'Traitor', 'stressed', 'personal', 'emotional', 'cost', 'espionage', 'Eric', 'spy-against-his-will', 'had', 'not', 'only', 'forsake', 'wife', 'friends', 'who', 'were', 'upset', 'apparent', 'Nazi', 'sympathies', 'had', 'also', 'witness', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'George', 'Seaton', ""'The"", 'Counterfeit', 'Traitor', 'sobering', 'remarkable', 'degree', 'mostly', 'when', 'Marianne', 'given', 'confession', 'not', 'priest', 'questioning', 'Eric', 'Berlin', 'basement', 'cell', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'member', 'Hans', 'Holtz', 'stealing', 'Eric', 'briefcase', 'incriminating', 'letter', 'Eric', 'confrontation', 'Gestapo', 'man', 'Jaeger']",N/A

314457,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6302477425,Roger J. Buffington,"[84, 84]","It is terrific that this wonderful film is now available on DVD.  This is a gripping story of international espionage circa 1940-44.  Based upon a true story, William Holden turns in his customary stellar performance as a Swedish petroleum industrialist (of American deriviation--he had renounced his American citizenship, married in Sweden and become a Swedish subject) who is initially blackmailed by Allied intelligence to spy for the British and Americans.  Since Sweden is neutral, and Holden has extensive business connections in Nazi Germany, he is ideally suited to travel about Germany and locate targets for allied bombers.The development of Holden's character is superb, and the viewer truly gets a sense of what it might have been like to be a secret agent of this sort during the war.  Holden functions by blackmail and bribery, and the film does a fine job of not glossing over these basic components of spycraft.  The story develops methodically.  While initially Holden is a reluctant, even unwilling spy, eventually what he sees of German methods and brutality converts him into an enthusiastic allied agent.  The same is true of some of those whom Holden has bribed or blackmailed into cooperating with his activities.The cinamatography of the film is excellent, with European locales giving an authentic air to the film.  While I often dislike it when there is a narrative that overlays a movie, in this film it is done very well, and adds a great deal to the story.  The storyline moves at a brisk but thoughtful pace, never drags, and this film tells a great story.This is one not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a good spy flick.

Erickson works as an oil broker trading with both the Allied and Axis powers as Sweden was neutral during the war. Erickson asks the agent blackmailing him ""how does one become so cold blooded?"" The agent replies, ""watching Germans bomb London helps enormously."" The British release a black list of those trading with the Germans and Erickson's name is on it. The only way to get it off is if he works for the British.Erickson reluctantly agrees to work undercover for the British and a door to danger opens that imperils his life and a woman he cares for (Lili Palmer).A powerful well made film that has taken too long to show up on DVD, ""The Counterfeit Traitor"" features a strong, cynical performance by William Holden (I'm surprised he never appeared in a Hitchcock film given his demeanor) and an international cast of impressive supporting actors. Although ""The Counterfeit Traitor"" remains a perfect thriller and George Seaton's strong direction makes it worthwhile, I'm surprised that no studio has decided to remake this marvelous film.Although the Technicolor images looks exceptional vivid, there's considerable analog defects that crop up in this transfer. It's not a problem with the transfer itself but of the source material. Clearly the original negative has a number of defects however I'm surprised that Paramount didn't clean this up just a bit more prior to release. There's not a huge amount of them but they do crop up throughout the movie. Still, the image looks fairly sharp with solid blacks. The film features a restored mono soundtrack that sounds very good.
