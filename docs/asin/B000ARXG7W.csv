932493,A9T1R7JIWX3EU,B000ARXG7W,A. M. Smith,"[14, 21]","Do not be fooled by the blurb. This is just a run-of-the-mill porn flick with the nasties edited out - nothing more. Turns out there's a hardcore version as well, which includes all those edited-out nasties. It was not filmed, just shot on video, like all the hardcore stuff.  Witty?  Hardly.  Wooden porn ""actors,"" minimal script/dialogue, harsh lighting, choppy editing. No cinematic value whatever. Just a feeble attempt to create an R-rated product out of an X-rated flick, I guess to pull in a few extra bucks? Where ""The Fluffer,"" by the same filmmaker, was an actual movie with moderately capable actors and standard film techniques employed, this is just a watered-down skin-flick. May as well find the hardcore version and watch that, or better still, just rent one that's better made. It would almost certainly hold one's interest longer than this throwaway.",1,Pee-yew,1130198400,"10 25, 2005",2005,868,"['Do', 'not', 'be', 'fooled', 'blurb', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'porn', 'flick', 'nasties', 'edited', 'out', 'nothing', 'more', 'out', 'hardcore', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'edited-out', 'nasties', 'was', 'not', 'filmed', 'just', 'shot', 'video', 'hardcore', 'stuff', 'Witty', 'Hardly', 'Wooden', 'actors', 'minimal', 'script/dialogue', 'harsh', 'lighting', 'choppy', 'editing', 'cinematic', 'value', 'Just', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'create', 'R-rated', 'product', 'X-rated', 'flick', 'guess', 'pull', 'few', 'extra', 'bucks', 'Where', 'Fluffer', 'same', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'actual', 'movie', 'moderately', 'capable', 'actors', 'standard', 'film', 'techniques', 'employed', 'just', 'watered-down', 'skin-flick', 'May', 'well', 'hardcore', 'version', 'watch', 'better', 'still', 'just', 'rent', 'one', 'better', 'made', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'longer', 'throwaway']",N/A

Not only is there nudity, but there's barely concealed hard-core sex scenes that try to masquerade as a soft core porn. (Really, the camera angles can only hide so much!)Even so, the idea behind this is actually pretty cute & could have been the basis of an interesting serious film rather than a porn plot. People who are into this sort of thing will love it... and for good reason. The actors are clearly enjoying themselves & there's lots of steamy chemistry. People who aren't into soft or hardcore porn won't.

I've seen my share of gay porn both hardcore and soft. Both styles are unique to me. Now on with the review.Obviously this film is a gay porn take-off on the Ring-it has humor, hunky guys, great sex scenes, and a goofy but enjoyable story. The premise is goofy-you watch a tape, get a phone call saying 'in seven days you'll be gay'I wasn't sure if that was meant to be funny, but it made me laugh either way.
