963618,A6833RMCXTKLZ,B000DZ95F8,Augustine  Invictus,"[6, 8]","This documentary is very interesting and also revolting in the sense that it exposes the 2 sides( good and evil) of a European sovereign, King Leopold II of Belgium. The good side which many people may find hard to accept is that he did raise the level of an unknown primitive Congo  into an exotic Belgian colonial state with its remarkable geography and wildlife which was evidently an explorer's dream. But perhaps his most significant deed was his exploitation of its natural resources to contribute fuel to the ongoing outside world's Industrial Revolution.With all due respect to his Majesty,he could be dubbed a benefactor by some,although with a Jekyl and Hyde personality. And at what cost to the Congo and its indigenous inhabitants? Revolting!...which exposes his bad side that greatly overshadows the good.Wanton slavery,burning and devastation of villages,torture,murder of human beings, mutilation and amputation of limbs! Could it be that this revolting practice of amputation was started by Leopold II in a gigantic scale in the Congo so that the idea was passed on to the rest of Africa to be implemented in its subsequent post colonial civil wars? As one reviewer from Lagos,Nigeria puts it plainly: This historical documentary about the Congo's exploitation may serve as an aid to understand modern Africa by ""looking at each country and exposing the roots of its pains."" I highly recommend watching and studying this interesting DVD.",5,The two faces of Leopold II of Belgium,1187136000,"08 15, 2007",2007,1453,"['documentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'also', 'revolting', 'sense', '2', 'sides', 'good', 'evil', 'European', 'sovereign', 'King', 'Leopold', 'II', 'Belgium', 'good', 'side', 'many', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'hard', 'accept', 'did', 'raise', 'level', 'unknown', 'primitive', 'Congo', 'exotic', 'Belgian', 'colonial', 'state', 'remarkable', 'geography', 'wildlife', 'was', 'evidently', 'explorer', 'dream', 'perhaps', 'most', 'significant', 'deed', 'was', 'exploitation', 'natural', 'resources', 'contribute', 'fuel', 'ongoing', 'outside', 'world', 'Industrial', 'Revolution.With', 'due', 'respect', 'Majesty', 'could', 'be', 'dubbed', 'benefactor', 'Jekyl', 'Hyde', 'personality', 'what', 'cost', 'Congo', 'indigenous', 'inhabitants', 'Revolting', 'bad', 'side', 'greatly', 'good.Wanton', 'slavery', 'burning', 'devastation', 'villages', 'torture', 'murder', 'human', 'beings', 'mutilation', 'amputation', 'limbs', 'Could', 'be', 'revolting', 'practice', 'amputation', 'was', 'started', 'Leopold', 'II', 'gigantic', 'scale', 'Congo', 'idea', 'was', 'passed', 'rest', 'Africa', 'be', 'implemented', 'subsequent', 'post', 'colonial', 'civil', 'wars', 'one', 'reviewer', 'Lagos', 'Nigeria', 'plainly', 'historical', 'documentary', 'Congo', 'exploitation', 'may', 'serve', 'aid', 'understand', 'modern', 'Africa', 'looking', 'country', 'exposing', 'roots', 'pains', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'studying', 'interesting', 'DVD']","Congo: White King, Red Rubber, Black Death"

I want to learn more about the Congo, Belgium and King Leopold II and think I might find some more interesting materials.  This film was a good start.

It goes into a good deal of depth on the history and how Leopold exploited the country and set it up for further failure in the future. It was very interesting and kept me glued to the tube.
