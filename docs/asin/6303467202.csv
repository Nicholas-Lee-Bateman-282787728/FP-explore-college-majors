I was trying to find it on DVD, but couldn't (unless it was digitally cut) so I opted for the VHS version. My kids are still very young and don't understand the story so it's boring to them, but this really is a cute story of brothers and sisters trying to stay together and having to live on their own for a while.",5,Good family movie,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",2013,370,"['watched', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'was', 'digitally', 'cut', 'so', 'opted', 'VHS', 'version', 'kids', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'young', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'story', 'boring', 'really', 'cute', 'story', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'trying', 'stay', 'together', 'having', 'live', 'own', 'while']",N/A

376009,A25RN8X70DSZLU,6303467202,JRP,"[0, 0]","I am going to review On Our Own  I hadn't seen this movie in years I used to have The VHS of this movie.  Directed by Layman Dayton who has been a fairly big producer & has a few directing roles to his credit he hasn't directed in like 10 years. The movie stars Scott Warner as Mitch, Amy Allred as Kate, Tom Dayton as Travis, Stephanie Kramer as Lori, Leigh Lambert as Peggy Williams, Sam Hennings as Jack Glover, Mike Wuergler as Mr Arnold & Donre Sampson as The LA Detective.The story is these 4 kids Mitch, Kate, Travis & Lori have lost their Mother & they're going to separated in different Foster Homes they find out the youngest Lori is going to be put in a Foster Home & they're going to lose her. Mitch the oldest Sibling decides they should walk back to their house & get some money, find out where their Uncle Jack lives & take their Mom's Car to Arizona so he can give them the location of where their Father is at. In the meantime you have this LA Detective & Mr Arnold looking for them. These kids have a believable reason for running away cause their Mom died & they're going to be split up. The back & forth between Scott Warner & Amy Allred does make me believe they're Bro & Sis. You're introduced to this character named Peggy Williams who is on a sort of road trip she is talking to  her Mom which in between the movie you have this conversation with her & Peggy which is entertaining.  Anyway Mitch doesn't have enough money for gas & he ends up driving off  Kate leaves a note saying they will pay them back later. I did laugh at that Later on that night Mitch is getting tired Kate tells him to pull over if he is tired. He falls asleep at the wheel he goes off the road awakes & stops it. The next morning the car won't start & they're stranded & this scene is very believable between Scott Warner & Amy Allred. You have Peggy  come through she notices the group of kids she asks what's going on Mitch lies about their Father going into town for gas she takes them into town none of the people have seen their Dad so she uses a Pay Phone to call The Cops she finds out it's not in service Mitch drives off with her car I can give this character a pass because he is only doing this cause he doesn't want them to be split up. They get to another town & Mitch accidentally damages Peggy's Car in this scene Travis finds a quarter & uses it in The Slot Machine where he wins $50 to $100 in Quarters. But these 2 wanna be thugs want the money cause 1 of them says it was his Quarter. A scuffle breaks out Mitch & Kate try their best but it doesn't work Peggy shows up pulls a fake gun on them & they run off. Mitch ends up telling her the truth. The next day the car breaks down they're picked up by this trucker they end up at their Uncle Jack's House you're introduced to Jack his Girlfriend Teresa who has this bratty kid named Rhett. Jack has Rhett show the kids the farm animals Rhett won't let Mitch feed The Horse's he grabs the carrots from Rhett he tosses a bucket of water at Mitch they get in a fight & Rhett's nose is busted. Meanwhile Jack tells Peggy he is not really their Uncle. Rhett cries to Mommy Peggy is going to take the kids back to LA. Mitch overhears a conversation between Jack & Peggy that Dad is in Prison. The next day a this Bus Station Mr Arnold & The Detective show up so Mitch steals the bus leads Police on a chase Peggy gets in a cab tells the driver to follow the bus Mitch tries his best to flee Uncle Jack shows up in a plane where he decides to take kids & he ends up getting custody. The film ends with Peggy's Mother who has baked cake cause Peggy Marrying Jack. On Our Own is not Oscar worthy stuff but I enjoyed it & I still do after going I don't know how long without seeing it. I care about these characters they have a real reason to run away there are bits of humor that I laugh at. Lyman Dayton did a good job as well as most of the cast does a good job. I hope you enjoyed this retrospective & review of On Our Own & I have another bonus review coming of Cyborg then I will do a 20 years ago review for Cyborg 2.",5,On Our Own retrospective & review a movie that I watched a lot when I was younger 9/10,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",2013,4082,"['am', 'going', 'review', 'Own', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'used', 'have', 'VHS', 'movie', 'Directed', 'Layman', 'Dayton', 'who', 'been', 'fairly', 'big', 'producer', 'few', 'directing', 'roles', 'credit', ""n't"", 'directed', '10', 'years', 'movie', 'Scott', 'Warner', 'Mitch', 'Amy', 'Allred', 'Kate', 'Tom', 'Dayton', 'Travis', 'Stephanie', 'Kramer', 'Lori', 'Leigh', 'Lambert', 'Peggy', 'Williams', 'Sam', 'Hennings', 'Jack', 'Glover', 'Mike', 'Wuergler', 'Mr', 'Arnold', 'Donre', 'Sampson', 'LA', 'Detective.The', 'story', '4', 'kids', 'Mitch', 'Kate', 'Travis', 'Lori', 'have', 'lost', 'Mother', ""'re"", 'going', 'separated', 'different', 'Foster', 'Homes', 'find', 'out', 'youngest', 'Lori', 'going', 'be', 'put', 'Foster', 'Home', ""'re"", 'going', 'lose', 'Mitch', 'oldest', 'Sibling', 'decides', 'should', 'walk', 'back', 'house', 'get', 'money', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'take', 'Mom', 'Car', 'Arizona', 'can', 'give', 'location', 'where', 'Father', 'meantime', 'have', 'LA', 'Detective', 'Mr', 'Arnold', 'looking', 'kids', 'have', 'believable', 'reason', 'running', 'away', 'cause', 'Mom', 'died', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'split', 'up', 'back', 'forth', 'Scott', 'Warner', 'Amy', 'Allred', 'make', 'believe', ""'re"", 'Bro', 'Sis', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'character', 'named', 'Peggy', 'Williams', 'who', 'sort', 'road', 'trip', 'talking', 'Mom', 'movie', 'have', 'conversation', 'Peggy', 'entertaining', 'Anyway', 'Mitch', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'gas', 'up', 'driving', 'off', 'Kate', 'note', 'saying', 'will', 'pay', 'back', 'later', 'did', 'laugh', 'Later', 'night', 'Mitch', 'getting', 'tired', 'Kate', 'pull', 'tired', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'road', 'next', 'morning', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', ""'re"", 'stranded', 'scene', 'very', 'believable', 'Scott', 'Warner', 'Amy', 'Allred', 'have', 'Peggy', 'come', 'group', 'kids', 'what', 'going', 'Mitch', 'Father', 'going', 'town', 'gas', 'town', 'none', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'Dad', 'Pay', 'Phone', 'call', 'Cops', 'not', 'service', 'Mitch', 'off', 'car', 'can', 'give', 'character', 'pass', 'only', 'doing', 'cause', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'split', 'up', 'get', 'town', 'Mitch', 'accidentally', 'damages', 'Peggy', 'Car', 'scene', 'Travis', 'quarter', 'Slot', 'Machine', 'where', '50', '100', 'Quarters', '2', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'thugs', 'want', 'money', 'cause', '1', 'was', 'Quarter', 'scuffle', 'breaks', 'out', 'Mitch', 'Kate', 'try', 'best', ""n't"", 'work', 'Peggy', 'up', 'pulls', 'fake', 'gun', 'run', 'off', 'Mitch', 'up', 'telling', 'truth', 'next', 'day', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', ""'re"", 'picked', 'up', 'trucker', 'end', 'up', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'House', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Jack', 'Girlfriend', 'Teresa', 'who', 'bratty', 'kid', 'named', 'Rhett', 'Jack', 'Rhett', 'show', 'kids', 'farm', 'animals', 'Rhett', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'Mitch', 'feed', 'Horse', 'carrots', 'Rhett', 'bucket', 'water', 'Mitch', 'get', 'fight', 'Rhett', 'nose', 'busted', 'Meanwhile', 'Jack', 'Peggy', 'not', 'really', 'Uncle', 'Rhett', 'cries', 'Mommy', 'Peggy', 'going', 'take', 'kids', 'back', 'LA', 'Mitch', 'conversation', 'Jack', 'Peggy', 'Dad', 'Prison', 'next', 'day', 'Bus', 'Station', 'Mr', 'Arnold', 'Detective', 'show', 'up', 'so', 'Mitch', 'bus', 'Police', 'chase', 'Peggy', 'cab', 'driver', 'follow', 'bus', 'Mitch', 'best', 'flee', 'Uncle', 'Jack', 'up', 'plane', 'where', 'take', 'kids', 'up', 'getting', 'custody', 'film', 'Peggy', 'Mother', 'who', 'baked', 'cake', 'cause', 'Peggy', 'Marrying', 'Jack', 'Own', 'not', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'stuff', 'enjoyed', 'still', 'do', 'going', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'seeing', 'care', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'reason', 'run', 'away', 'are', 'bits', 'humor', 'laugh', 'Lyman', 'Dayton', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'hope', 'enjoyed', 'retrospective', 'review', 'Own', 'have', 'bonus', 'review', 'coming', 'Cyborg', 'then', 'will', 'do', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'review', 'Cyborg', '2']",N/A

Their mother has died and they are on their way to four separate foster homes. They run away together in search of their uncle. As kids will, they make nmany wrong choices. However, they are not left without consequences. I really enjoyed the movie with its charming story.
