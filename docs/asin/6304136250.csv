Alain Shabat, who plays the male lead, & husband, is one of the most talented actors I have ever seen.  His facial expressions, and body language are perfect.  I love this movie.  I watch it again, and again, whenever I want to laugh and be happy.If you are a woman, and you have been ""wronged"" by your man, this movie will make you feel exceedingly  happy, when you see the tables turned on the cheating husband.  It is so, so entertaining.

403627,A13ZPQNYAWRII9,6304136250,burneyfan@btinternet.com,"[6, 7]","Loli, played by Victoria Abril, has given up a promising career as a dancer to  become the wife of a womanising estate agent; and though she knows of one woman he has had an affair with and has forgiven him, she knows nothing about any of the others - not even her own baby-sitter! No. Her main complaint against him is not his promiscuity but that he takes her for granted and shows her little affection. So, when a butch lesbian, played by Josiane Balasko, appears on the scene, stopping at the house to ask for water for her van's radiator, she is a ripe fruit waiting to be picked. And this kind, mature, worldly-wise lesbian is an expert in the art of seduction.On an evening out together, the husband, played  by Alain Chabat, already annoyed at the lesbian's intrusion into his home with his wife's encouragement, is driven into a blind fury when he discovers, on bending down to retrieve a cigarette from under the table, the lesbian's hand half way up his wife's thigh, and then sees them dancing together very intimately. From this follow many scenes of shouting and screaming, jealousy and rage. You feel for the husband's usurpation and his humiliation at being rejected for a lesbian - though you rejoice at his come-uppance - and you feel for the wife who deserves the affection she has been so long denied, and you feel for the lesbian with a loving heart who wants only to make the wife happy - though others may condemn her for destroying a relatively happy marriage. The husband hates her so much and is so desperate to get rid of her that he is willing to do anything, and in the end reluctantly accepts her condition for leaving; that he should go to bed with her and give her a baby.But despite all the passion and jealousy, this is a light comedy and not a heavy drama, and you have the feeling all along that everything will work out well in the end. And it does. The moral of the story, affirmed at the end, is that the only things that matter are love, tenderness and affection and if we get those the source's sexual gender is immaterial; we are all bisexual.This is a bright, witty and observant comedy, well-acted, particularly by Victoria Abril, and constantly entertaining.",4,A witty and observant comedy.,980035200,"01 21, 2001",2001,2203,"['Loli', 'played', 'Victoria', 'Abril', 'given', 'up', 'promising', 'career', 'dancer', 'become', 'wife', 'womanising', 'estate', 'agent', 'one', 'woman', 'had', 'affair', 'forgiven', 'nothing', 'others', 'not', 'even', 'own', 'baby-sitter', 'No', 'main', 'complaint', 'not', 'promiscuity', 'granted', 'little', 'affection', 'So', 'when', 'butch', 'lesbian', 'played', 'Josiane', 'Balasko', 'scene', 'stopping', 'house', 'ask', 'water', 'van', 'radiator', 'ripe', 'fruit', 'waiting', 'be', 'picked', 'kind', 'mature', 'worldly-wise', 'lesbian', 'expert', 'art', 'seduction.On', 'evening', 'out', 'together', 'husband', 'played', 'Alain', 'Chabat', 'already', 'annoyed', 'lesbian', 'intrusion', 'home', 'wife', 'encouragement', 'driven', 'blind', 'fury', 'when', 'bending', 'down', 'retrieve', 'cigarette', 'table', 'lesbian', 'hand', 'half', 'way', 'wife', 'thigh', 'then', 'dancing', 'together', 'very', 'intimately', 'follow', 'many', 'scenes', 'shouting', 'screaming', 'jealousy', 'rage', 'feel', 'husband', 'usurpation', 'humiliation', 'being', 'rejected', 'lesbian', 'rejoice', 'come-uppance', 'feel', 'wife', 'who', 'affection', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'denied', 'feel', 'lesbian', 'loving', 'heart', 'who', 'only', 'make', 'wife', 'happy', 'others', 'may', 'condemn', 'destroying', 'relatively', 'happy', 'marriage', 'husband', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'rid', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'end', 'reluctantly', 'condition', 'leaving', 'should', 'go', 'bed', 'give', 'baby.But', 'passion', 'jealousy', 'light', 'comedy', 'not', 'heavy', 'drama', 'have', 'feeling', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'end', 'moral', 'story', 'affirmed', 'end', 'only', 'things', 'matter', 'are', 'love', 'tenderness', 'affection', 'get', 'source', 'sexual', 'gender', 'immaterial', 'are', 'bisexual.This', 'bright', 'witty', 'observant', 'comedy', 'well-acted', 'particularly', 'Victoria', 'Abril', 'constantly', 'entertaining']",French Twist VHS

Genre pieces today seem to stay comfortably in their own domain. Comedy is usually nothing but funny and action films are usually nothing but skilful computer effects. There is a tremendous amount of crying going on in this film that isn't comic, but a real portrayal of the complex arrangement of desire and its negative effects. This is especially so because of the children involved and you have to wonder that if it were real life would it all end so happily. In any case, I find myself now remembering it as funny again because any situation where a pig-headed man gets humiliated will always be funny. Victoria Abril is simply sexy and the juxtaposition of her with the charismatic Josiane Balasko is simply a hoot. It is also good to see issues of homosexuality portrayed in a slightly more humorous manner than hard dramas that end in tragedy and doesn't compromise the character's to a mere comedy of campness at the same time.

Now you have to understand that I am uncomfortable with the type of nudity usually shown in foreign films (full frontal and mostly men at that) so for me to continue watching this flick it had to have had something more than gratuitous anatamy shots. Guess what.....it does! Like a cheap dime store novel I couldn't put it down. Like those ""shocking"" tabloids at the checkout line I ""had to pick it up"". This is a good movie! I mean I pity that poor actress Victoria Abril for having to kiss such an unattractive ""leading"" (woman, man?) whatever. But seeing as how that (woman, man?) was also the director I suppose she had no choice. The actress is outstanding in the role as the neglected housewife who can't seem to get her husband ""started"". Why this guy is on the prowel with a goddess for a wife defys logic but after all it is a movie. And while we're at it Alain Chabat the actor who plays the philandering husband is fantastic! Some of the dialogue is below the belt crass vulgar stuff that may make you blush. But thank goodness it's in French. I think that reading helps you scan over those vulagrities. It's worse to have to hear them in your native language. So.....in conclusion my fellow Americans. Boycott French wines, cheeses, and anything else you can do without....I agree with you on that.

403634,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,6304136250,"Mark E. Summers ""Gamekrazy""","[5, 9]","Sometimes I think that telling you too much of the plot of the movie on the back of the box, and having those reviews on the box telling you how great the movie is can be a mistake.  Maybe I had too much expectation when I sat down to watch this movie because although it was somewhat enjoyable, I just never really got all that involved in it, or took too much away from it.  Really good movies, and really bad movies both leave a lasting impression in my mind, and I like to talk about them afterwards, this one, when it was done, that was it, back into its box and back to the video store to be quietly forgotten.I've heard them say that love is blind, and from some things I have seen, that is sometimes true, but I'm not blind.  That might be one of the problems I had with this movie, I just wasn't convinced that these two women could actually fall in love.  There seemed to be no real chemistry between them, and I really couldn't even buy into the butch character, smoking her smelly cigars, and dressing like a man.  How many stereotypes did we really need in this movie anyway?Overacting, and overreacting are two of the biggest flaws that I found in the movie.  When the unfaithful husband realizes that his wife and this butch woman who has invaded his house have something going on between them, his overreaction and overacting are hard to bear.  I watched in a kind of numb disinterest as he raved back and forth, like he was mister innocence himself, and still the scene extended on and on, long past the time when it should have quietly slipped away.  And then it continues on the next day as he rants some more, as he and his friend go on a bike ride, and he unconvincingly breaks down some more at a little restaurant or coffee shop.  Who writes this stuff?That was the worst, although there was another scene that was almost as bad, when two of the lesbians other friends happen to show up, and the wife flips out almost as much as her husband did earlier.  This scene was painful to watch, and I couldn't imagine who would have really stayed around for the uncomfortable scenes that happen during the dinner, and after it.  It seemed so unbelievable, and the wifes reaction so out in left field that I was cringing through the scene, though I believe it was supposed to be dramatically funny.The ending left me hanging a little bit, not seeming to be a big enough payoff for the hour and a half I had invested into the movie.  However, I can live with it as long as they don't try to expand on it with a French Twist 2.  Let well enough alone.This movie is at least worth a rental, but no more than that, if only to see Abril, who plays the wife.  She is very beautiful, and except for the one unbelievable scene where she flips out, seems to be the best of the actors or actresses who starred in this movie.  If she could pick better movies, she would really be something to see, so check it out, at least for her.",3,"Don't expect too much, you'll enjoy it more then",982972800,"02 24, 2001",2001,2936,"['Sometimes', 'think', 'telling', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'movie', 'back', 'box', 'having', 'reviews', 'box', 'telling', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'mistake', 'Maybe', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'expectation', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'involved', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'Really', 'good', 'movies', 'really', 'bad', 'movies', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'mind', 'like', 'talk', 'afterwards', 'one', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'was', 'back', 'box', 'back', 'video', 'store', 'be', 'quietly', 'forgotten.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'say', 'love', 'blind', 'things', 'have', 'seen', 'sometimes', 'true', ""'m"", 'not', 'blind', 'might', 'be', 'one', 'problems', 'had', 'movie', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'convinced', 'two', 'women', 'could', 'actually', 'fall', 'love', 'seemed', 'be', 'real', 'chemistry', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'buy', 'butch', 'character', 'smoking', 'smelly', 'cigars', 'dressing', 'man', 'How', 'many', 'stereotypes', 'did', 'really', 'need', 'movie', 'anyway', 'Overacting', 'overreacting', 'are', 'two', 'biggest', 'flaws', 'found', 'movie', 'When', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'wife', 'butch', 'woman', 'who', 'invaded', 'house', 'have', 'something', 'going', 'overreaction', 'overacting', 'are', 'hard', 'bear', 'watched', 'kind', 'numb', 'disinterest', 'raved', 'back', 'forth', 'was', 'mister', 'innocence', 'still', 'scene', 'extended', 'long', 'time', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'quietly', 'slipped', 'away', 'then', 'next', 'day', 'more', 'friend', 'go', 'bike', 'ride', 'unconvincingly', 'down', 'more', 'little', 'restaurant', 'coffee', 'shop', 'Who', 'stuff', 'was', 'worst', 'was', 'scene', 'was', 'almost', 'bad', 'when', 'two', 'lesbians', 'other', 'friends', 'happen', 'show', 'up', 'wife', 'out', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'husband', 'did', 'earlier', 'scene', 'was', 'painful', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'stayed', 'uncomfortable', 'scenes', 'happen', 'dinner', 'seemed', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'wifes', 'reaction', 'so', 'out', 'left', 'field', 'was', 'cringing', 'scene', 'believe', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dramatically', 'funny.The', 'ending', 'left', 'hanging', 'little', 'bit', 'not', 'seeming', 'be', 'big', 'enough', 'payoff', 'hour', 'half', 'had', 'invested', 'movie', 'However', 'can', 'live', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'expand', 'French', 'Twist', '2', 'Let', 'well', 'enough', 'alone.This', 'movie', 'least', 'rental', 'more', 'only', 'see', 'Abril', 'who', 'wife', 'very', 'beautiful', 'one', 'unbelievable', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'starred', 'movie', 'could', 'pick', 'better', 'movies', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'something', 'see', 'so', 'check', 'out', 'least']",French Twist VHS

Different parts of this movie will offend the sensibilities of... just about everyone.Quick plot breakdown:  Laurent and Loli are a married couple with two children.  Laurent cheats on his wife constantly.  He genuinely loves her, but he can't stop cheating.  One day while Laurent is off engaging in adulterous shenanigans, a van breaks down in front of their house.  The van driver is Marijo, who knocks on the door and asks to use the telephone.  Loli lets her in.  Hilarity ensues.I loved Marijo.  If this movie had been made in Hollywood, Marijo would have been a twenty-something, stick-skinny, raven-haired tomboy.  In this film... not so much.  Marijo (awesomely portrayed by director Josiane Balasko) is an unapologetic, cigar smoking, butch dyke.  LOVED LOVED LOVED HER.Did I mention that this movie does not apologize for its stereotypes?  No, it does not.  And there are many stereotypes - the lonely housewife, the philandering husband, the mannish lesbian drifter.

Maybe I should be able to lighten up and try to enjoy such farces.My original review: OK, the philandering husband deserved to have his wife pay him with his own coin--by alternating between him and a drug-ridden lesbian. Granted. While the threesome may be logically just, the result is the destruction of a marriage that could be saved. Moreover, nobody asks about the impact of this bizarre threesome on the children. The idea that the husband would make a deal with the fat ugly lesbian to make her pregnant strikes me as grotesque and sickening.

As a huge foreign film buff there I was taking a gander at this movie and realizing the script was totally hilarious.Basically it focuses on this married couple who have two children, a French family. And of course, the man, not wanting to offend all of the women he's ever met, sleeps with them all. (Side note, it is actually a compliment when men make passes in France, it is offensive to not do it, it means the female is not worth trying with; interesting huh?)Anyway, hubby cheats, the devoted wife finds that a dyke passerby can fix things, be there for her, and even have dinner.A steamy romance ensues with the wife and her new woman and the cheating hubby does not take it to well.You will laugh your ass off in this movie!

Makes me like it that much more when I see them enjoying it.&quot;French Twist&quot; is about a cheating husband has to deal with the fact that his neglected wife has found another love interest... a woman. That he cheats on his wife on a regular basis is not the issue, to him. His ego and pride being stepped on by the whole situation is the problem and it makes for some very funny material.The three main characters (Josiane Balasko, Victoria Abril and Alain Chabat) work extremely well together. Just bouncing lines off one another and interacting beautifully. Just when it looks like all will work out another element is added to stir the fire.The film was written and directed by Balasko who also stars as the &quot;other&quot; woman who's looking for love and destroying a home. Or is she? Chabat is amazingly funny as the philandering husband and Abril is also very good and quite beautiful as the passionate, yet somewhat confused wife.Check it out for yourself.
