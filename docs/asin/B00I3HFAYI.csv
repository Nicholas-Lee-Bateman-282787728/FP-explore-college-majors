1693338,A16IMMGL2T8JQ1,B00I3HFAYI,"R. Elmore ""Pete Schmitz""","[16, 17]","why is this &#34;real&#34;?  Because I am a casual observer not an NHRA fan, and after reading other reviews I think a straight forward review is lacking and this film deserves one. My only history is I had the Hot Wheels. For reference I will use Rush, another race film.This movie has lots of vintage footage, which I like- compare to the kind of bluish hue in Rush. I'll tell you what I thought- I absolutely loved it. What an enjoyable time spent watching it. The human drama here is different from Rush but no less compelling. I thought the casting was ideal; the acting was great all around; I enjoyed all the vintage footage, and I really liked getting to know the men behind the names, their personal stories and struggles. This IS NOT, let me be clear, a movie for race fans. This is just a great movie. If you are a race fan you will especially love it, but this movie stands as it is, on it's own as a story that is worth telling. This would be a great date night or family movie- movies like this are why we invented popcorn. I admit I didn't have high expectations going in- boy was I ever wrong. It is so refreshing to have a compelling movie like this that is such that you can just sit back and let it transport you into a great story; unlike Rush, this isn't really about losing or winning- when you see it you will realize it is about something more important in people. I cannot believe how much I enjoyed it. .",5,this needs a real review,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",2014,1430,"['why', '34', 'real', '34', 'am', 'casual', 'observer', 'not', 'NHRA', 'fan', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'think', 'straight', 'forward', 'review', 'lacking', 'film', 'one', 'only', 'history', 'had', 'Hot', 'Wheels', 'reference', 'will', 'use', 'Rush', 'race', 'film.This', 'movie', 'lots', 'vintage', 'footage', 'like-', 'compare', 'kind', 'bluish', 'hue', 'Rush', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'what', 'thought-', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'What', 'enjoyable', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'human', 'drama', 'here', 'different', 'Rush', 'less', 'compelling', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'ideal', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'enjoyed', 'vintage', 'footage', 'really', 'liked', 'getting', 'know', 'men', 'names', 'personal', 'stories', 'struggles', 'NOT', 'let', 'be', 'clear', 'movie', 'race', 'fans', 'just', 'great', 'movie', 'are', 'race', 'fan', 'will', 'especially', 'love', 'movie', 'own', 'story', 'worth', 'telling', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'date', 'night', 'family', 'movie-', 'movies', 'are', 'why', 'invented', 'popcorn', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'in-', 'boy', 'was', 'ever', 'wrong', 'so', 'refreshing', 'have', 'compelling', 'movie', 'such', 'can', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'let', 'transport', 'great', 'story', 'Rush', ""n't"", 'really', 'losing', 'winning-', 'when', 'see', 'will', 'realize', 'something', 'more', 'important', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed']",N/A

The two biggest stars Don &#34;The Snake&#34; Proudhomme (Williams) and Tom &#34;Mongoose&#34; McEwen decide to join together and form a partnership. This partnership leads to a sponsorship with Hot Wheels as well as taking the sport to new heights. But like most things the rivalry on the track leads to tension off. I have stated before that I am not a big car racing fan, real life or movies. I wasn't a fan of Days of Thunder but I did think Rush was OK. This one is more along the lines of Rush. This one deals with the off the track aspect rather then the actual on track racing. The acting is OK but the thing that really helps the movie is the fact that it used actual race footage during the scenes, rather then the cheesy recreations most often used. Again though racing fans will really like this, but for people like me, I thought it was OK but nothing I'd watch again.
