There's so few laughs in this film, you could call it a documentary.  It's  definitely not on the top of the list on Mr. Williams' resume`, I can  assure you.  It's not even that entertaining, and I think that's something  else that detracts from the movie.  You think you'll be entertained, and  nothing really happens.  Mr. Williams' character goes from one tragedy to  the next, and it just never seems to get better.  The modern-day finale  story is good, but the rest of the film is just missing &quot;the  spark&quot; that he has in him when he has a meaty role (like &quot;Dead  Poet's Society&quot; or &quot;Awakenings&quot;...or even &quot;Mrs.  Doubtfire&quot;!)

361900,A3001TBF8Y7HY8,630318457X,"J. Terry ""JT""","[1, 1]","That's what the movie is about. It's very deep, but I agree with another reviewer that it is not for the average movie watcher. I first saw it way back when it was released in the theaters. It changed my life. After watching this movie, I made some major life changes. It helped me to see human life in the context of forever, instead of the way most people see it (very finite). Only some people will get it. So if you find that you like thinky movies or movies that aren't generally well-received, you can watch this film. Whether or not you believe in reincarnation at all or as it's presented here, I think it can still offer one a perspective on life as a time of learning. It can help a person remember not to beat oneself up too badly when mistakes have been made, it's all a learning process. Just try to do better next time (next time you have the same choice or next lifetime, if you believe in reincarnation).  If you like Oscar-winning films & directors, better skip this one. It is not for the mainstream audience.UPDATE: I rewatched this movie today. I stand by what I said earlier: Some people will get it (and some won't). I absolutely love this movie! I wish I could locate and speak to the writer and director Bill Forsyth. There just aren't words to express my adoration.If you're looking for some guidance as to what the movie is about and whether you'd like to take the gamble, look up Being Human (1994) on wikipedia. It will tell you in plain English what the movie is about. You still have to watch it to experience it though.The pace is slow and subdued and you must be an insightful person to understand the full meaning of this film.

I have this on VHS sitting in my closet, and finally saw it's on DVD so I bought it (even though DVD itself is now an outdated media format!).I do love this movie.  It's a unique film, with some quirky funny bits and a lot of heart.  Robin Williams plays a man/father during many various time periods.  Each segment is somewhat interconnected to the next, as well as to the present, but in ways that aren't easy to see, which is why many people may not ""Get it"".  (Not that I do!

I'm a big fan of history and what I think this movie provides is a fairly accurate glimpse into various points in history. There's not a lot of action or special effects, nor is there a big twist at the end. It's just everyday life in various points in time. Not necessarily mundane moments in time but nothing here is heightened by a convulsive series of unusual actions. For example, one of the segments takes place after a shipwreck. This is certainly not something that happens to the average person. But what they do once on-shore is typical for that period in time. They did hang people and many times quite ineffectively. And the guy in charge quite often wasn't prepared for the situation and had to make decisions that are based on a combination of his lack of experience and even intellect.

It had Robin Williams as the star, playing several different characters, and it was directed by Bill Forsyth. However, I was rather disappointed.

It's a interesting concept and the idea looks good on paper. However, it really doesn't work on film. The movie moved slow and several of the intertwining scenes were boring and distracted from the rest of the movie.
