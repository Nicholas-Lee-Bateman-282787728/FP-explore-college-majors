15555,A31IFLAAZO672R,0767819594,,"[0, 1]","It is a well-known fact that actors who start off in television or start off young don't have a chance of making it (case in point, Macaulay Culkin).  There are a few exceptions though, (George Clooney, Will Smith).  With this film, you see the showcase of three great young actors, Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Reese Witherspoon. Phillippe is the stand out, though. It would seem that this film should have established him as a super star but critics and fans were not buying it. Sarah Michelle Gellar, TV's Buffy, showed an evolution of her campy and teen savvy style- arrogance, seductiveness (not sure if that's even a word), manipulative, and the list goes on and on. Of course, this is not the type of person she is in real life but it is not everyday that an actress from a younger generation showcases her versatility. If people stop looking at her as Buffy and as an accomplished actress, then she would be successful. I have not read the book with which this film is based, nor have I seen the blockbuster Dangerous Liasons (there should be a law) but I can understand where the producers were going with this reimagining of the classic story. This film was made to introduce this story to a younger generation and I can understand that. The plot does not drag at all and it showcases the power of love and the power of the human conscience. Sebastian (Phillippe) loves to manipulate and seduce young girls with the help of his estranged and demonic stepsister Kathryn (Gellar). In the process of manipulating a young woman named Cecile (an excellent Selma Blair), Sebastian sets his sights on Annette Hargrove (Witherspoon) in hopes of manipulating and seducing her and boosting his ego and reputation as a womanizer. What he doesn't expect is to actually fall in love with her. The Hargrove character is a psychological case study. She sees right through Sebastian from the get-go but eventually falls in love with him. How is it that we tend to favor that which is seemingly bad for us? Love is a funny thing, isn't it? Think of Eleanor Roosevelt falling in love with Hitler. Anyway, the soundtrack to this film does not disappoint either.  It's a colorful mix of alternative rock, love songs, and that feel good music that almost everyone listens to. This film is excellent in presenting teenage characters that are not the classical interpretation of a teenager. This isn't your run-of-the-mill ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" farce with heavy drug usage, crappy one-liners, dumb parties, and skipping class for a day or night on the town, and an underdog acquiring some kind of supernatural edge to win over his bullies and getting his dream girl. This film explores the dark side of the teenager, proving that you do not have to be a certain age to be evil and that evil wears many faces. Though it explores evil, this also isn't a good versus evil story either. It is a story of how the power of love can overcome our own self-loathing and how it can melt even the coldest heart. This magnificent case study in mainpulation and love's dominance in the most unusal circumstances was one of the most underrated films of 1999. I guess everybody was too excited about Star Wars Episode I to truly notice a good film.",4,"Great film, great plot, great young actors, enough said!!!",1013212800,"02 9, 2002",2002,3243,"['well-known', 'fact', 'actors', 'who', 'start', 'off', 'television', 'start', 'off', 'young', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'chance', 'making', 'case', 'point', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'are', 'few', 'exceptions', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Will', 'Smith', 'film', 'see', 'showcase', 'three', 'great', 'young', 'actors', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'Phillippe', 'stand', 'out', 'though', 'would', 'seem', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'established', 'super', 'star', 'critics', 'fans', 'were', 'not', 'buying', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'TV', 'Buffy', 'showed', 'evolution', 'campy', 'teen', 'savvy', 'style-', 'arrogance', 'seductiveness', 'not', 'sure', 'even', 'word', 'manipulative', 'list', 'course', 'not', 'type', 'person', 'real', 'life', 'not', 'everyday', 'actress', 'younger', 'generation', 'versatility', 'people', 'stop', 'looking', 'Buffy', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'successful', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 'have', 'seen', 'blockbuster', 'Dangerous', 'Liasons', 'should', 'be', 'law', 'can', 'understand', 'where', 'producers', 'were', 'going', 'reimagining', 'classic', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'introduce', 'story', 'younger', 'generation', 'can', 'understand', 'plot', 'not', 'drag', 'power', 'love', 'power', 'human', 'conscience', 'Sebastian', 'Phillippe', 'manipulate', 'seduce', 'young', 'girls', 'help', 'estranged', 'demonic', 'stepsister', 'Kathryn', 'Gellar', 'process', 'manipulating', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Cecile', 'excellent', 'Selma', 'Blair', 'Sebastian', 'sights', 'Annette', 'Hargrove', 'Witherspoon', 'hopes', 'manipulating', 'seducing', 'boosting', 'ego', 'reputation', 'womanizer', 'What', ""n't"", 'expect', 'actually', 'fall', 'love', 'Hargrove', 'character', 'psychological', 'case', 'study', 'right', 'Sebastian', 'get-go', 'eventually', 'love', 'How', 'tend', 'favor', 'seemingly', 'bad', 'Love', 'funny', 'thing', ""n't"", 'Think', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'falling', 'love', 'Hitler', 'Anyway', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'not', 'disappoint', 'either', 'colorful', 'mix', 'alternative', 'rock', 'love', 'songs', 'feel', 'good', 'music', 'almost', 'everyone', 'film', 'excellent', 'presenting', 'teenage', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'classical', 'interpretation', 'teenager', ""n't"", 'run-of-the-mill', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'farce', 'heavy', 'drug', 'usage', 'crappy', 'one-liners', 'dumb', 'parties', 'skipping', 'class', 'day', 'night', 'town', 'underdog', 'acquiring', 'kind', 'supernatural', 'edge', 'win', 'over', 'bullies', 'getting', 'dream', 'girl', 'film', 'dark', 'side', 'teenager', 'proving', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'certain', 'age', 'be', 'evil', 'evil', 'wears', 'many', 'evil', 'also', ""n't"", 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'story', 'either', 'story', 'how', 'power', 'love', 'can', 'overcome', 'own', 'self-loathing', 'how', 'can', 'melt', 'even', 'coldest', 'heart', 'magnificent', 'case', 'study', 'mainpulation', 'love', 'dominance', 'most', 'unusal', 'circumstances', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'films', '1999', 'guess', 'everybody', 'was', 'too', 'excited', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'truly', 'notice', 'good', 'film']",N/A

15571,A2O7MOWVMSKO5J,0767819594,,"[2, 3]","It is a shame that this film is famed for a lesbian kiss, because that one moment seems to overshadow the rest of this creative, amusing, and utterly  enthralling film about two manipulative step-siblings and their eventual  downfalls. This film is essentially about Sebastian making a bet with his  step-sister and object of obsession Kathryn that he can get celibate virgin  Annette into bed. If he loses? She gets his '56 Jaguar Roadster. But if he  wins? He gets to 'put it anywhere', so to speak, and I'm not talking about  the car anymore. Great premise, if not morally warped. If that doesn't  appeal to your dark sense of humour, then this isn't the film for you.  Otherwise, read on...Ryan Philippe plays Sebastian cool and subtle as the  sensualist with a heart of lead, a character imbued with such manipulative  charm that you cannot help but like him. Reese Witherspoon, Philippe's  real-life wife, amazingly resists the 'butter-wouldn't-melt' stereotype  associated with such a moralistic role and is an intriguing balance to  Sebastian's icy charisma. But it is Sarah Michelle Gellar, old Buffy  herself, who steals the show as the promiscuous cocaine addict Kathryn, all  at once sultry and evil and incredibly alluring. The sexual chemistry  between Gellar and Philippe is electric, every scene that they share  infused with an air of sensual arousal that is clearly created by the  actors' own youthful hormones running wild. As far as putting feelings onto  film is concerned, these scenes fully convey their lustful platonic  relationship as an almost tangible emotion, and it is this that is the  film's starring grace.The story swings and bounds as two stories in one,  Sebastian's quest for sex and Kathryn's attempted revenge upon innocent  boyfriend-stealing Cecile merging into one engaging twisted schematic.  There was always, of course, the risk of the ending becoming schmaltzy  (Philippe, inevitably, realising he truly does love Ms. Witherspoon, like  all good Hollywood fare), but, despite Sebastian's evident change of heart,  the false sentimentality of this is, thankfully, avoided. Not overly  cleverly, mind, for it does not sit well with the rest of the story, but  the final scene of Kathryn's downfall fully redeem it, as The Verve's  'Bittersweet Symphony' plays triumphantly in the foreground. It is truly  one of those classic movie moments, up there with the greats.Obviously,  Cruel Intentions is not a realistic film. It is deliciously overblown in  the way that 'Wild Things' is overblown, but that does not mean that it's a  bad film. Critics have been far too harsh; it's not meant to be taken as a  serious representation of teenage life, it's about a bunch of rich kids  getting their kicks by playing with other rich kids. Flashy, sexy,  entertaining and memorable, you could do much worse than owning a copy of  this.

They have no regard or use for all that is decent and fair. It is the story of their relationship, one embroiled in a continuing one-upmanship, that ultimately becomes a losers game for all touched by it.There are four main characters, and they all have a special role. Sebastian (Ryan Phillipe), and Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar as a BRUNETTE) play two young collegiate step-siblings who try to out do eachother with the games they hurtfully engage their chosen victims in. Kathryn takes great pride in everyone thinking she's the sweet, innocent student body president. In reality she's a scheming, promiscuous coke snorter. Sebastian is a handsome, smug seducer, using his good looks to bed and heartlessly dump as many willing naive females as possible.  He keeps a journal of conquests, and his own private thoughts.Cecile (Selma Blair), is the PERFECT naive wanna-be cool girl come to campus. She becomes the perfect victim and pawn for Kathryn and Sebastian to use for their games while Annette (Reese Witherspoon), is a model of what the young american girl is SUPPOSED to be. Kathryn finds an article on her in a teen magazine entitled ""Why I Want To Wait"" about Annette keeping her viginity until legally wed. From there, Kathryn hatches a scheme. She makes a bet with Sebastian that he CAN'T seduce Annette. If he IS successful, he gets to bed Kathryn, putting ""it"" ""anywhere."" If Kathryn wins, and Sebastian FAILS, she gets his prized '56 Jaguar Roadster. Kathryn's concurrent plan is to destroy Cecile's reputation because a guy dumped her for the Cecile. Let the cruelty begin!This is a film that takes you past the front gate to where the players of high society have and live by their own rules, no matter the cost. You can feel the privilige within. The dialogue throughout is clever witty reparte that is sharp and cutting as a knife. It is a real pleasure to listen to the banter, and see eyes roll with disgust. Christine Baranski is excellent as Cecile's uptight high society mom who is as stiff as the starch in her Chanel suit. Let's not forget, Kathryn's famous lesbian kiss scene in the park is hilarious too, as she pulls away, leaving Cecile puckered up, eyes closed and waiting for more!The most amazing thing in the movie is how you start out with different feelings about some of the characters, than you will have in the end. You come to see that love, when truly felt and experienced, can soften even the coldest heart.When viewing this film, there are times to laugh, be shocked, or shed a tear.  ""Cruel Intentions"" is a movie not to be missed.

I agree with the previous reviewer that the turnaround of Sebastian is unbelievable.  We are supposed  to believe that this sociopath falls in love, and suddenly finds grace and  a soul?  While his sister remains the evil, conniving one?  Both are pretty  heinous characters throughout the film. In this story it is implied that a  truly despicable character can redeem himself without any real effort.  Sebastian is transformed into the wronged hero. But perhaps his fate at the  end is a commentary on his previous behavior.  I hope that was the  filmmaker's intention, not just to manipulate us into feeling sorry for  him.The movie itself does an &quot;about-face,&quot; going from a  satirical comedy to a melodrama. At times Kathryn and Sebastian's behavior  and manner of speech is so over-the-top that it is laughable.  The only  characters who seem somewhat real are Ronald and Annette, though Annette's  attraction to Sebastian strikes me as highly unlikely.(And what is it  with the lesbian kissing scene between Kathryn and Cecile?  It was not  unpleasant to watch, but certainly not necessary or pertinent to the plot.  And it seemed out of place considering the characters'  personalities.)This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it seems  to be a sad commentary on what is acceptable entertainment at the turn of  the 21st century.  Why do we entertain ourselves with such vulgar and  hideous depictions of young life?  I know that all films cannot be cheery  and rosy.

The two movies share some names and many plot details, but they could hardly have been more different. Indeed, the the basic plot does seem much more suitable to a teen comedy ('Cruel Intentions') than to a film noir set in, of all places, eighteenth-century France ('Dangerous Liaisons'). As a matter of fact, 'Cruel Intentions' deserves three stars only because of the cleverness with which the original story was adapted to modern times and high-school mentality.Speaking of 'Cruel Intentions' alone, the movie is more than teenage dirty talk and flippant sexual intrigues - neither of which contains anything shocking for anybody older than 12 years indeed. Towards the end the story gets pretty serious and there are few highly dramatic scenes between Sarah Michelle Gelar and Ryan Phillippe which are not without merit, both as dialogue and as acting. Reese Witherspoon gives a fine perfomance as well.For what's worth, the movie is hugely entertaining but with the right dose seriousness to make well worth watching. It's about the facts of life: love, hate, vanity, pride, envy, malice. Most negative qualities, admittedly, but common to all of us none the less for that.P. S.

Laced with material that is in one instance shocking and controversial and in the next uproarious, this is not a film for everyone but it is a film that has something `for' everyone in it.Couple that with the fact that Ryan and Reese are just SOOO cute together.The film (which is based off of the film `Dangerous Liaisons') centers around step-siblings Sebastian and Kathryn.  The two basically run their upscale school with intensity that is unmatched.  The two toy with fellow students to satisfy their own need for attention (although this film is far from focused on the emotional turmoil causing these sadistic games) and so when the young and proud virgin Annette moves in they instantly gravitate towards `toying' with her life.  Kathryn, who has denied Sebastian access to her loins, makes him a deal.  If he can compromise Annette's moral standing then Kathryn will grant him said access, but if he fails in his mission then Kathryn gets Sebastian's prized car.Simple enough, until Sebastian falls in love.Complaints have been made with the altered ending (which shifts the comical and devilish tone of the film almost drastically, and suddenly) but I personally adored that aspect of the film.  I loved the playfulness of the first two thirds, but I also found it rather reminiscent of almost every other teen-comedy that was being released at the time (the late 90's was a goldmine, or landfill, for teen-comedies).

But aside from that,  this is a very entertaining movie.  Sarah Michelle Gellar expands her range  playing a bitchy sort of anti-Buffy.  Ryan Phillipe's acting style,  sometimes called soulless and cold, fits his (originally) heartless  character perfectly, and he has good chemistry with Reese Witherspoon  (small wonder, since they are now married), who does very well in the role  of the proud virgin.  Selma Blair is hilariously naive and ridiculous, and  Joshua Jackson, in a rather brief role, steals the few scenes he's in.

But hey... it sure is fun to watch. Basing my opinions on this movie on what I saw and  not on what I did NOT see (Dangerous Liasons) completely leans toward all  fairness for writer/director Kumble. Artsy reviewers who didn't like this  film compare it to the &quot;superior&quot; Malkovich one. Alone, the movie  certainly appeals to a general audience: teeny boppers. Yes, teeny boppers.  Purveyors of the successes of such box-office smashes as Scream, I Know  What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty, etc. I'm 18, so it's  not like I don't qualify. Liking artsy movies such as the Godfather,  Chinatown, Casablanca, etc. probably won't justify my review as an  intelligent one, but oh well. Cruel Intentions is a sexy satire on  upper-class teens in the 90's. Maybe the &quot;big words&quot; is overdoing  it sometimes, and certain scenes seem unnecassery. Like when Selma Blair  and Sarah Michelle Gellar share an intimate tongue kiss, with the camera  panning 2 inches away from the salivating action. It's not like I'm  complaining. That's probably my favorite scene of the movie (I'm an 18 year  old male), but did it really belong? Overall, a very enjoyable movie with a  twisted plot, but with mediocre acting and scenes that just seem to go on  too long. Judge for yourself. Worth the money, I guess.

15599,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767819594,Dennis Littrell,"[13, 14]","It's probably better if you haven't seen Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons (1989), starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer, or Milos Forman's Valmont (1988) with Annette Bening, Colin Firth and Meg Tilly.  If you have, Roger Kumble's Cruel Intentions (1999), starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Reese Witherspoon, which is also based on the novel by the Frenchman Choderlos de Laclos, will seem to lack finesse.  Kumble wrote his own screenplay as a kind of Les Liaisons Dangereuses in modern dress, whereas Frears and Forman relied more heavily upon the stage play by Christopher Hampton, depicting the aristocracy of 18th century France.  While the two earlier movies sparkle with wit, insight and a cynicism to chill the fondest heart, Kumble's venture features a more prosaic brand of sexual humor adorned agreeably with young, nubile bodies.But there is no need to make odious comparisons.  Cruel Intentions can stand on its own, and there is plenty to admire, especially Gellar in a role to which she is perfectly suited, and Witherspoon as well.  Phillippe is also good, especially when he's being funny, although his unconscious imitation of John Malkovich was a bit obsequious.  He delivered some of his lines with the same deadpan expression and intonation.  But being as pretty as he is, Phillippe's character is more like Colin Firth's.  Selma Blair's narrow-eyed and dotty Cecile was pretty, sexy, and funnier than either Uma Thurman or Fairuza Balk, who played  similar roles in the above mentioned movies, respectively.The scene with the shrink to begin was very agreeable and should have been followed up somehow.  We never see Sebastian quite so diabolical later on.  Too bad.  And seeing a little more of Swoosie Kurtz who played the self-centered, phony and hypocritical Dr. Regina Greenbaum would have enhanced the film.The idea of making Sebastian and Kathryn step siblings was amusing and spicy, and the inclusion of a raunchy gay footballer was appropriate.  Using a black guy as Cecile's harp teacher was kinky good.  And being rather up-front about sex throughout without being overly juvenile was refreshing.  The business with Sebastian Valmont's diary of conquests worked well both psychologically and as a plot device.The main failing with Kumble's movie, aside from the general superficiality, was that Sebastian's ""conquest"" of Annette was a little too easy, especially with the goody-goody build-up she had been given.  Consequently, her falling in love was more like a stumble.  There was some physical passion, but nothing like the full-blown emotional passion required.  Also I think the ending needed a little work.  It seemed that a committee divined it, part of them wanting a ""happy"" love ending for Reese and Ryan, and the other half wanting to stay somewhat true to the spirit of the original, and so they came to a compromise, as committees will, and we got mishmash.Incidentally, there is yet a fourth movie version of this tale, Dangerous Liaisons (1960), from French director Roger Vadim.

Sarah Michelle Gellar plays one of the most wicked femme fatales (Kathryn) you will ever encounter on-screen.  Reese Witherspoon portrays the typical all-American, virtuous midwestern girl (Annette).  In between is a womanizer, Sebastian, played by Ryan Phillippe.All of the characters in the movie are fabulously wealthy, but more than a few are deficient when it comes to matters of the heart.  People who enjoy eye candy will enjoy some of the sets of this movie - particularly the lavish indoor swimming pool @ the cottage.Sebastian and Kathryn make a bet: can the suave playboy score on Annette?  This, along with a web of insidious sub-plots form the core of the movie's plot.  In each and every case, Kathryn and Sebastion outwit everyone else in the film in order to manipulate circumstances into their favor.  Occasionally, they even dupe each other.Over the course of the film, however, Sebastian's character begins to change, albeit slightly.  Meanwhile, Kathryn remains the cold-hearted and sadistic wench she always was.  It is a credit to the acting ability of Phillippe that the change in character becomes apparent and we're actually compelled to care for him by the end of the film.To answer the $60,000 question on whether a sweet innocent girl can have a significant impact on a life-long playboy, watch the film.

15611,AWA0CA9AYL5YQ,0767819594,Jennifer Litchfield,"[2, 2]","Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses).  Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls.Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers.  They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome.  The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard.

The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers.

It has everything including Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe, my favorite actor and actress. It also has a perfect soundtrack. The songs actually liven the mood of whatever scene they are featured in, unlike some other films out there. The sets are amazing too, really breathtaking. Kathryn's room is done is ice blue, because that is what she is...cold. Sebastian's is rich gold and brown, because he has that soft inner side to him which eventually does come out in the movie when he falls in love with Annette. I won't bore you with the details or what the movie is about, because every other review has done that already. All I can say is that this movie is perfect, because it has an original plot & it's a modern telling of an alltime classic novel. You couldn't ask for a more talented cast including the wonderful Reese Witherspoon and newcomer Selma Blair. This is a movie that once you watch, you want to watch it over and over again. There's something new each time you watch it. The DVD is amazing also.

15613,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,0767819594,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[9, 12]","Everyone knows that few people can be more cruel than the young, particularly teens. Some, unfortunately delight in the torment of others ann can even take this torment to the next level by posing as ""friends"" thereby giving themselve even more opportunity to do harm. That such people exist is frightening; that they can change is enlightening.Cruel intentions is a character study of one such change. Two fithly rich step-siblings delight in the way they can manipulate others. They also exercise a degree of psycho-sexual torture on each other. Each wants to get the upper hand. For the most part, though, they do not let this get in the way of their prime motivation of hurting others through backstabbing and deceit. These two miscreants decide on a wager that will seem to give both what they desire. He bets his classic car against the pleasures of her body. The challenge is to utterly destroy the reputation of the new girl in school who is as clean as the driven snow. What neither counted on, however, was that some of the cleaness rubs off on him. His character change comes in fits and starts; he can still be an manipulator but it is clear that he is really changing. Sis doesn't like that and sets him up for a big fall, thereby setting herself up for her own fall.This film is strong drama all the way through but is a little weak towards the end. It is filled with moments of sadistic glee, lightened by humor of all things. Many is the time while watching that you see some cruel act taking place and have a bit of guilty twinge for appreciating the subtlety and sometimes the humor with which it is done.The is no doubt that this is a modernized knock off of the ""Dangerous Liasions"" story. The basic premise is the same but it is set with modern teens in Manhatten. That just multiplies the opportunities for cruelty to reign. It makes me glad i am no longer a kid.Rarely do the ""special features"" of a DVD interest me but I did pay attention to the ones on this disk. Compared to many others, they are not exceptional but they do help to illustrate the complexity of the characters involved. I mean in particular the deleted scenes selection. In it are a few seems that were omitted. These would seem trivial but each is begun with a director's commentary which describes why the scene was cut or re-edited. This does an effective job of showing the difficulty in creating a truly dastardly character and trying to rehabilitate that character before the film is over. In most cases, the scene was shortened or cut because it was felt that inclusion would drive peopel too far into hating the anti-hero and make caring for him by the end too difficult. This was not at all apparent to me until seeing these scenes and then it was obvious.This isn't the greatest drama ever made but it is good and is certainly worth the effort in viewing it.",4,A Portrait of Cruelty and Redemption,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,2861,"['Everyone', 'few', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'cruel', 'young', 'particularly', 'teens', 'unfortunately', 'delight', 'torment', 'others', 'ann', 'can', 'even', 'take', 'torment', 'next', 'level', 'posing', 'friends', 'thereby', 'giving', 'themselve', 'even', 'more', 'opportunity', 'do', 'harm', 'such', 'people', 'exist', 'frightening', 'can', 'change', 'enlightening.Cruel', 'intentions', 'character', 'study', 'one', 'such', 'change', 'Two', 'fithly', 'rich', 'step-siblings', 'delight', 'way', 'can', 'manipulate', 'others', 'also', 'exercise', 'degree', 'psycho-sexual', 'torture', 'other', 'get', 'upper', 'hand', 'most', 'part', 'though', 'do', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'prime', 'motivation', 'hurting', 'others', 'backstabbing', 'deceit', 'two', 'miscreants', 'decide', 'wager', 'will', 'seem', 'give', 'what', 'desire', 'classic', 'car', 'pleasures', 'body', 'challenge', 'utterly', 'destroy', 'reputation', 'new', 'girl', 'school', 'who', 'as', 'clean', 'driven', 'snow', 'What', 'counted', 'however', 'was', 'cleaness', 'rubs', 'off', 'character', 'change', 'fits', 'starts', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'manipulator', 'clear', 'really', 'changing', 'Sis', ""n't"", 'like', 'up', 'big', 'fall', 'thereby', 'setting', 'up', 'own', 'fall.This', 'film', 'strong', 'drama', 'way', 'little', 'weak', 'end', 'filled', 'moments', 'sadistic', 'glee', 'lightened', 'humor', 'things', 'Many', 'time', 'watching', 'see', 'cruel', 'act', 'taking', 'place', 'have', 'bit', 'guilty', 'twinge', 'appreciating', 'subtlety', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'done.The', 'doubt', 'modernized', 'knock', 'Dangerous', 'Liasions', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'same', 'set', 'modern', 'teens', 'Manhatten', 'just', 'opportunities', 'cruelty', 'reign', 'glad', 'i', 'am', 'no', 'longer', 'kid.Rarely', 'do', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'interest', 'did', 'pay', 'attention', 'ones', 'disk', 'Compared', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'not', 'exceptional', 'do', 'help', 'illustrate', 'complexity', 'characters', 'involved', 'mean', 'particular', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'selection', 'are', 'few', 'were', 'omitted', 'would', 'seem', 'trivial', 'begun', 'director', 'commentary', 'why', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 're-edited', 'effective', 'job', 'showing', 'difficulty', 'creating', 'truly', 'dastardly', 'character', 'trying', 'rehabilitate', 'character', 'film', 'over', 'most', 'cases', 'scene', 'was', 'shortened', 'cut', 'was', 'felt', 'inclusion', 'would', 'drive', 'peopel', 'too', 'far', 'hating', 'anti-hero', 'make', 'caring', 'end', 'too', 'difficult', 'was', 'not', 'apparent', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'drama', 'ever', 'made', 'good', 'certainly', 'worth', 'effort', 'viewing']",N/A

15621,A152C8GYY25HAH,0767819594,Matthew Horner,"[6, 7]","The delightfully wicked and clever Cruel Intentions is the fourth movie version of Les Liasons Dangereuses, Choderlos de Laclos' 18th Century novel about some very dangerous emotional games played by a group of amoral upper-class Frenchmen. This is the first version that takes this two-hundred year old tale and places it in modern day New York City. In the original, Kathryn and Valmont were in their 30s. Cruel Intentions makes them teenagers. That this update works as well as it does is a credit to its makers.Kathryn and Valmont [Sarah Michelle Geller and Ryan Phillipe] are two spoiled yuppie brats whose hobby in life is to bring as much misery in life to others as they can. The really fun part of this evil game is to devise their plots so that they themselves emerge unscathed. Kathryn is the obvious Game Master, for while Valmont has garnered a bad reputation to all who know him, she is still seen as an icon of virtue. She is student body president at the posh private school they attend. Teachers, parents and students consider her a role model. For this reason, she is the more dangerous of the two.Kathryn's mother is Valmont's stepmother. She and Valmont's Dad travel constantly. The kids are free to do as they please. They are sexually attracted to each other, but Kathryn is far too manipulative to allow anything beyond fooling around to occur. This makes Valmont her slave, although he is too vain to realize it.Kathryn learns that her boyfriend has dumped her for her school's new headmaster's daughter, Annette [Reese Witherspoon]. Kathryn, of course, never loved the boy. Highly placed socially, he was merely convenient for her. Her fury stems from the fact that she's used to being the one who does the dumping. Annette has written an article for a big magazine. She explains the reasons why she is putting off having sex until she finds true love. Kathryn makes a wager with Valmont. If he can't seduce Annette, his sports car is hers. If he can, she is his prize. Her body, she believes, is worth wagering in order to destroy Annette's reputation.Valmont accepts the bet and begins to pursue Annette. What follows is a story full of deceit, treachery and surprise.Sarah Michelle Geller, the star of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, once seemed to be stick in the horror genre. Her movies include I Know What You Did Last Summer and Scream 2. With Cruel Intentions, she makes a bold move to more sophisticated roles. Ryan Phillipe is a hot commodity these days, but has yet to get a part which can prove whether or not he can really act. Reese Witherspoon will probably become a star. Her turns in Election and Pleasantville, as well as this movie, have been very satisfactory.

While this was panned by critics, it spoke to something in the audience in it's sociopathic tendencies.Sarah Michelle Geller plays Kathryn, the student body president of an elitist New York boarding school and step sister of Ryan Phillipe, the big man on campus whose charms hide a sinister skirt chaser.  She makes a bet with him that he will not be able to bed Reese Witherspoon, who has proclaimed her intensions to remain a virgin until marriage.  Should he succeed, he can have Kathryn.  If he fails, Kathryn can have his car.Perhaps critics were astounded that kids can really be this cruel, but maybe they forgot what it was like to be a kid themselves.  Just listen to the gossip and heartless talk of teenagers and you will know what I mean.  Ryan Phillipe is every girl's dream come true and worst nightmare.  While he uses his good looks and charms to get as many women in his bed as he can, he will post nude photos of them on the Internet and pat himself on the back as a stud.  Give him a challenge, such as Reese Witherspoon, and he has to work hard for it.  While he is truly a cad, he does in the end feel love for Reese because he had to work for her affections.  Kathryn gets the greatest satisfaction of saying no, as she knows that he is truly hurt to have ended the affair when they did nothing but take joy in toying with emotions.  Listen to a few locker room conversations and chats in the homeroom, that's what it's all about.As the viewer, you can't help but take perverse pleasure in their plotting and watching others fall victim to their schemes.  How about that scene when Kathryn says she puts her trust in Jesus and unscrews the cross to reveil her coke spoon?  That's classic.  If anything it teaches you to not fall for others' fronts.  So girls, be careful of who seems so sincere.

The movie is very good and takes many twists and turns. I sometimes felt as if I would be able to predict what would happen next, but of course it didn't.The movie starts out showing Sebastien (Ryan Phillipe) with a therapist. Sebastian talks about his so called former life where all he thought about was sex. He says he has changed but that is not true. I'll skip some unimportant stuff and go on.He goes home where his stepsister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is talking to Cecile's mother. Cecile is a girl who will be attending Kathryn and Ryan's school next year. Afterwards, Kathryn wants to destroy Cecile's reputation because Cecile dated her ex-boyfriend. Kathryn wants Sebastian to seduce Cecile to enhance his reputation. Sebastian is known for sleeping with tons of girls.Sebastian would rather sleep with the new headmaster's daughter, Annette (Reese Witherspoon) who writes articles about how she is a virgin and plans to wait. Kathryn and Sebastian make a bet. If Sebatian can't bed Annette, Kathryn gets his car. If Sebastian wins, he gets Kathryn.The movie goes on from there with Sebastian falling for Annette and Kathryn trying hard to destroy Cecile.

But surprisingly, I found that I was pinching myself several times while watching this movie because it is unbelievably good. It seems that this was actually a remake of another movie. I don't know if Cruel Intentions lived up to that movie, but one thing I do know...I really enjoyed it.The story revolves around two siblings, Sebastian and his stepsister Kathryn. Kathryn is the very definition of a two-headed snake. She's prim and proper on one side, and a total b*tch on another. Sebastian meanwhile, is an open book. The whole world knows he's one charming jerk. Together, the two create havoc among their peers. They backstab and sweet-talk their way to getting things done for their own satisfaction. Kathryn proposes a new challenge for Sebastian, that he's to bed Annette, the new principal's daughter/virgin of the school. Sebastian of course, ends up falling in love with Annette, but will they end up together? Throw in some secondary characters, some plot twists and the result is a whole lotta fun.A big part of why I enjoyed this show is definitely the cast. Sarah Michelle Gellar does a complete 180 degrees for her role of Kathryn. It was like the Buffy we knew was never there. She is so deliciously evil, manipulating everybody around her, twisting and turning facts to her advantage. Ryan Phillippe initially plays Sebastian cool as a cucumber, but ends up with feelings of pain and torment to reflect what his character is going through. Although it's not an Oscar-worthy performance, heck...it's really convincing and doesn't seem fake or pre-conceived. Reese Witherspoon plays Annette with spunk and the whole ""women power"" aura...the reluctant lover. Even the supporting cast, Selma Blair, Joshua Jackson and Sean Patrick Thomas were a delight to watch. I guess, it's because they play such different characters than what they're accustomed to play.The script is also better than most teen garbage Hollywood throws at us. It stays away from the Land of Predictability, the plot twists were believable and the end was a stunner. Trust me, not your typical ending. And the music selection was also impressive, it gave the movie that extra feel.In short, I really liked this movie. It's not groundbreaking, but it does stand out.

If a female kissing a female repulses you, the fast forward button is probably your friend (although most teenage guys won't find ANYTHING wrong with some lady-lady  action). For all those adults with the raised eyebrows, okay you have  reason. But there's more to this movie than just the sex premise it  suggests.  What's behind all that is a great lesson. Although most people  don't see it at first, at the core this movie is showing us that being evil  and taking advantage of people isn't going to get you anywhere.  The  premise is that a spoiled little rich kid (played by Ryan Phillippee? I  don't think I spelled that right) makes a bet with his beautiful and  downright evil stepsister addicted to coke (played by a convincing Sarah  Michelle Gellar, with red hair no less). If he can't deflower proud virgin  Annette Hargrove (played by Reese Witherspoon in her most suprising and  well acted role), the headmaster's new daughter, she gets his car. If he  can, he gets her, in bed. There's more to this twisted and twisting story,  but that's the story at the core. Of course all the other parts play  important roles in this, but I won't give that away.  Forget the critics  for a moment. There's some pretty good acting for a movie dubbed for 'only  teens'. And the story was very well written. Maybe it shouldn't have toted  itself as a teen 'Dangerous Liasons' and it wouldn't have gotten half the  critisism. Since most teens haven't seen 'Liasons', then this movie should  be a good rent.  So for all those who have wanted to see it, rent it. At  least then you'll get to decide if you like it or not.

We have Sebastian Valmont and Kathryn Mertueil, step brother and sister who are bored rich kids living in the city, they also specialise int he above mentioned qualities. Sebastian is a bit of a lady's man and is getting bored of seducing and sleeping with the same kinda girls. He wants a challenge. So Kathryn bets him he cannot seduce the new headmasters daughter (Anette Hargrove, Resse Witherspoon) at school, who also happens to be a virgin and is firm on her stance to wait for love before losing it. The rules of the bet are if Kathryn wins she gets Sebastians hot car, if Sebastian wins he gets to sleep with Kathryn, when Sebastian asks ""why would i go for that bet?"" Kathryn sums it up by saying ""Because im the only person you cant have and it kills you"". So with the rules in place and the clock ticking Sebastian sets off on his mission. The only obstacle is falling in love.

15630,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0767819594,S. Schell,"[16, 20]","Hailed as the modern day version of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; failed miserably with audiences and critics alike for the hopes of a sleek, sensual update of the classic original.  This was merely another teen movie, the only difference being that there  are gratuitous sexual references and racy stunts by Sarah Michelle Gellar  and Selma Blair in their infamous screen kiss, tongues and all. Yes, Ms.  Buffy herself is quite a promiscuous deviate as Kathryn Merteuil (think  Marquise de Merteuil, played by Glenn Close in the stunning original) in  this movie, licking her cocaine spoon and gambling with her high-standing  reputation as an irrefutably sound and urbane young lady. Then there's Ryan  Phillippe as the lead male, Sebastian Valmont (John Malkovich's role as the  self-absorbed Vicomte de Valmont), made immediate family of Kathryn by  their parents' marriage. He is a blue-blooded spoiled brat who effortlessly  takes advantage of younger impressionable girls and flicks them to the curb  with nary a regret. He is a charming cad, charting his territory carefully  and fooling everyone with his innocuous and well-mannered guise.Kathryn's and Sebastian's relationship with each other is not quite close  to platonic, being that their slight sexual attraction to one another gives  the audience the willies. However, they soon make a deal, show their  civility in a firm handshake and begin to conspire like brother and sister.  This is where the premise of the story begins and it starts with the  souring of a doe-eyed ingenue named Cecile Caldwell (de Volanges - Uma  Thurman's naive portrayal), played by underground talent Selma Blair.  Cecile is a gullible youngster whom Sebastian easily seduces and drags on  his invisible chain of habitual deception, only to lose his prospect to  another indecent and illusory connoisseur.Sebastian's truly immoral  prowess doesn't surface until Kathryn picks his seemingly unobtainable  goal: a young virgin named Annette Hargrove (the equivalent to Michelle  Pfeiffer's Madame de Tourvel). A firm believer in abstinence before  marriage with a nationally published essay to prove it, Annette arrives in  town visiting relatives and rooming in their lush mansion whilst Sebastian  prowls her chambers, working his black magic to rob her of her only virtue.  She proves at first to be resilient and opposing to his magnetic appeal,  but like all silly girls, eventually falls prey to his false pretenses. In  obtaining the trophy of the contest, Sebastian realizes he's not going for  the gold anymore but honestly loving Annette instead. In the end, his pride  overwhelms his desire to confess his true feelings. Not only does he suffer  the agony of defeat, but ultimately he loses what matters most.The  only thing I find redeeming about this movie is its hip soundtrack,  featuring artists like Blur, Counting Crows, The Verve, and Skunk Anansie.  It blends a great deal of talented artists in the alternative genre, giving  this immature film a cool, stylish flow. I also enjoyed watching Joshua  Jackson ham it up as the flaming gay acquaintance Blaine Tuttle, prodding a  macho, closet-gay boyfriend who insists to his college buddies that he's  straight as an ironing board. Well, a straight stick is crooked in the  water, and so is the vision for this film on all sides of the mirror,  especially in the department of direction. Roger Kumble was obviously  masterminding with a pre-pubescent slant when he cast this film because  both female leads are nearly adolescent in their appearance, highly  attractive and visibly well-endowed. There is also no realism involved in  any action of this movie and it's highly suggestive of what he thinks teens  crave for an ultimate fantasy lifestyle. Sure, I wouldn't mind owning a '56  Jaguar Roadster, but this film is unrealistic in the way it makes its  characters seem superhuman and overly mature. Nobody that age acts like  that and never will. It's just not palpable.If you want an honest and  true version of 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' with class and sensibility, then  opt for Malkovich, Pfeiffer and Close.

The movie depicts how two step-siblings play mental games with one another with the intention of destroying the other. I have to admit this is a fun movie because it's always neat to watch those that are rich who have nothing to do but to destroy people's lives. The movie is well-known for the excellent acting by its leads. Sarah Michelle Gellar (from TV's ""All My Children"" and the ""Buffy"" series) and Ryan Phillippe star as the dastardly duo. The bet the two make is that if Sebastian (Phillippe) beds the headmistress' daughter of the school that Kathryn (Geller) attends, Sebastian can then bed Kathryn. If not Kathryn gets Sebastian's most prized toy. The headmistress' daughter is played by future Oscar winner and wife of Phillippe, Reese Witherspoon. The DVD comes with a collectable booklet and a ton of bonuses including 6 deleted scenes, audio commenatary, music videos, and trailer, plus much more. Subtitles are in english and language is 5.1 Dolby Digital. There are also two fantastic sequels to this film called ""Cruel Intentions 2"" and ""Cruel Intentions 3"" that are just as good as the original.

Sebastian is sick of dating the same girls, and is looking for a real challenge.  Kathryn has just been dumped by her boyfriend (she usually does the dumping), and is looking for revenge.  Kathryn and Sebastian hatch a plan to ruin the life of her new boyfriend's squeeze, Celeste Caldwell (played hilariously by Selma Blair); on the side, Sebastian bets Kathryn that he can seduce the new headmaster's daughter, Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon).  If Sebastian loses the bet, Kathryn gets his classic Jaguar roadster, if he wins, he gets to have get Kathryn in bed (anyway he wants).What follows is a hilarious string of manipulation, deceit, sex, betrayal, and eventual retribution.  This movie did not fare as well at the box office as it should have, opening against such movies as American Pie, American Beauty, and The Rage: Carrie 2.  Fortunately, it picked itself back up upon its video release.  I recommend the sequel to this movie also, as it explains the origins of Sebastian's bad reputation, and it's just more vulgar.

15637,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,0767819594,wolfgang731,"[3, 3]","If you're familiar, even in passing, with Christopher's Hampton's stage play Les Liaisons Dangereuses (based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos) or its subsequent (and very popular) film incarnation, Dangerous Liaisons starring the insanely brilliant Glenn Close as the black hearted Marquise de Merteuil and, in my opinion, the miscast John Malkovich as the lascivious and callous bon-vivant, Vicomte de Valmont than you can easily forego seeing this rather inept and not surprisingly insipid modernization and blithely go about your business.  Something has definitely been lost in translation and it extends far beyond period costumes and Bach's keyboard concertos.  Though a teenager's ability to descend the depths of cruelty is well known and documented, rarely is it of the sophisticated and viciously calculated variety, such as is the case here.  Furthermore, we're not dealing with pawns that live within the sheltered environs and cloistered walls of 18th century France, but rather modern adolescents living rather privileged existences in one of the world's most modern and sophisticated cities, New York.  They're hardly as gullible as pious 15 year old girls reared in convents.  Pulling the wool over their collective eyes is going to take considerable effort not to mention near Machiavellian craftiness.  In this retelling, both the plot and characters reek of artifice and you don't know whether to laugh or take the film seriously.  It has nothing to do with the performances but rather with everything leading up to them, primarily a script that aches to be modern, yet is often times burdened with some stilted and archaic dialogue as if it's trying to hearken back to and somehow channel its original source.  I mean, how many 16 year olds nowadays do you know of that write actual letters?  I don't mean emails or text messages, I mean physical letters?  In short, the film, more often than not, suffers from an identity crisis.  The actors were more than decent and they did their best considering the material they were given and the soundtrack isn't at all bad, either.  In closing, the movie is hardly dreadful and it can be rather entertaining but, again, if you're familiar with the 1988 Stephen Frears' film or to a lesser extent Milos Forman's Valmont of a few years later, you'll find yourself squinting through Cruel Intentions, vainly and understandably searching for remnants of either film and their respective characters and will be left feeling somewhat frustrated by the exercise.",2,Strictly for the uninitiated,1251331200,"08 27, 2009",2009,2541,"[""'re"", 'familiar', 'even', 'passing', 'Christopher', 'Hampton', 'stage', 'play', 'Les', 'Liaisons', 'Dangereuses', 'based', '18th', 'century', 'novel', 'Pierre', 'Choderlos', 'de', 'Laclos', 'subsequent', 'very', 'popular', 'film', 'incarnation', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'starring', 'insanely', 'brilliant', 'Glenn', 'Close', 'black', 'hearted', 'Marquise', 'de', 'Merteuil', 'opinion', 'miscast', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'lascivious', 'callous', 'bon-vivant', 'Vicomte', 'de', 'Valmont', 'can', 'easily', 'forego', 'seeing', 'rather', 'inept', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'insipid', 'modernization', 'blithely', 'go', 'business', 'Something', 'definitely', 'been', 'lost', 'translation', 'far', 'period', 'costumes', 'Bach', 'keyboard', 'concertos', 'teenager', 'ability', 'descend', 'depths', 'cruelty', 'well', 'known', 'documented', 'rarely', 'sophisticated', 'viciously', 'calculated', 'variety', 'such', 'case', 'here', 'Furthermore', ""'re"", 'not', 'dealing', 'pawns', 'live', 'sheltered', 'environs', 'cloistered', 'walls', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'rather', 'modern', 'adolescents', 'living', 'rather', 'privileged', 'existences', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'modern', 'sophisticated', 'cities', 'New', 'York', ""'re"", 'hardly', 'as', 'gullible', 'pious', '15', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'reared', 'convents', 'Pulling', 'wool', 'collective', 'eyes', 'going', 'take', 'considerable', 'effort', 'not', 'mention', 'Machiavellian', 'craftiness', 'retelling', 'plot', 'characters', 'reek', 'artifice', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laugh', 'take', 'film', 'seriously', 'nothing', 'do', 'performances', 'rather', 'everything', 'leading', 'up', 'primarily', 'script', 'be', 'modern', 'yet', 'often', 'times', 'burdened', 'stilted', 'archaic', 'dialogue', 'trying', 'hearken', 'back', 'somehow', 'channel', 'original', 'source', 'mean', 'how', 'many', '16', 'year', 'olds', 'nowadays', 'do', 'know', 'write', 'actual', 'letters', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'emails', 'text', 'messages', 'mean', 'physical', 'letters', 'short', 'film', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'suffers', 'identity', 'crisis', 'actors', 'were', 'more', 'decent', 'did', 'best', 'considering', 'material', 'were', 'given', 'soundtrack', ""n't"", 'bad', 'closing', 'movie', 'hardly', 'dreadful', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'again', ""'re"", 'familiar', '1988', 'Stephen', 'Frears', 'film', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Milos', 'Forman', 'Valmont', 'few', 'years', 'later', ""'ll"", 'find', 'squinting', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'vainly', 'understandably', 'searching', 'remnants', 'film', 'respective', 'characters', 'will', 'be', 'left', 'feeling', 'somewhat', 'frustrated', 'exercise']",N/A
15638,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,0767819594,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[3, 3]","Cruel Intentions has been slammed by critics, who have unfairly and unfavourably compared it with 1989's Dangerous Liaisons (both films stem from Choderlos de Laclos's novel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses). Whereas Dangerous Liaisons is fairly faithful to the original, Cruel Intentions manipulates the plot - throwing a twist in the tail - and relocates the milieu from 18th century France to the present-day Upper East Side of New York, where underneath the veneer of respectability, wealthy teenagers plot each other's downfalls.Stepsiblings Kathryn Merteuil and Sebastian Valmont are two such teenagers. They amuse themselves by arranging reputation-destroying paybacks for those who have wronged them, and make wagers on the outcome. The focus of the movie is Sebastian's attempt to make a conquest of the Headmaster's virginal daughter, Annette (who, in a heavy-handed attempt at symbolism, wears white throughout almost the entire film).However, the movie certainly has some memorable high points, beginning at the very outset where the camera swoops fast and low over what appears to be a grassy park studded with rocks; only after the camera angles away does the viewer realise - with some discomfort - that the park is in fact a graveyard. The opening scenes also introduce the appealing and well-judged soundtrack, which includes artists as diverse as Placebo and Fatboy Slim. The Verve's song, Bittersweet Symphony, is an absolutely perfect 'just desserts' track at the film's conclusion.These kids are incredibly nasty and vindictive, but owing to the verbosity of the script and the almost total lack of adult chaperones appearing on screen, it is difficult at times to remember that they are only teenagers. In the end though, perhaps we just like to see someone be very, very wicked and almost get away with it.",5,You Will Be Discreet About This,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,1822,"['Cruel', 'Intentions', 'been', 'slammed', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'unfairly', 'unfavourably', 'compared', '1989', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'films', 'stem', 'Choderlos', 'de', 'Laclos', 'novel', 'Les', 'Liaisons', 'Dangereuses', 'Whereas', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'original', 'Cruel', 'Intentions', 'plot', 'throwing', 'twist', 'tail', 'milieu', '18th', 'century', 'France', 'present-day', 'Upper', 'East', 'Side', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'veneer', 'respectability', 'wealthy', 'teenagers', 'plot', 'other', 'downfalls.Stepsiblings', 'Kathryn', 'Merteuil', 'Sebastian', 'Valmont', 'are', 'two', 'such', 'teenagers', 'amuse', 'arranging', 'reputation-destroying', 'paybacks', 'who', 'have', 'wronged', 'make', 'wagers', 'outcome', 'focus', 'movie', 'Sebastian', 'attempt', 'make', 'conquest', 'Headmaster', 'virginal', 'daughter', 'Annette', 'who', 'heavy-handed', 'attempt', 'symbolism', 'white', 'almost', 'entire', 'film', '.However', 'movie', 'certainly', 'memorable', 'high', 'points', 'beginning', 'very', 'outset', 'where', 'camera', 'fast', 'low', 'what', 'be', 'grassy', 'park', 'studded', 'rocks', 'only', 'camera', 'away', 'viewer', 'realise', 'discomfort', 'park', 'fact', 'graveyard', 'opening', 'scenes', 'also', 'introduce', 'appealing', 'well-judged', 'soundtrack', 'artists', 'as', 'diverse', 'Placebo', 'Fatboy', 'Slim', 'Verve', 'song', 'Bittersweet', 'Symphony', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'desserts', 'track', 'film', 'conclusion.These', 'kids', 'are', 'incredibly', 'nasty', 'vindictive', 'owing', 'verbosity', 'script', 'almost', 'total', 'lack', 'adult', 'chaperones', 'appearing', 'screen', 'difficult', 'times', 'remember', 'are', 'only', 'teenagers', 'end', 'perhaps', 'just', 'see', 'someone', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'wicked', 'almost', 'get', 'away']",N/A
