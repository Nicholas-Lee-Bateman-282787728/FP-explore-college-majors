660126,AGEIT17HENDIS,B00005JPY4,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 2]","Does anyone from the ""Generation of '68"" who was interested in folk music, and there were legions of us, really remember the first time we heard that thrilling voice of Pete Seeger (generally then accompanied by a banjo). Probably for me it was in some variation of The Weavers' version of Lead Belly's ""Goodnight, Irene"" but I am really not sure. That deep but nevertheless gentle voice first came at us over the radio or on a record player (A what? I hear the younger set saying-well, old fogies, fill them in later). Not television, however, as this is one folksinger that was banned in Boston, as the old expression went.Why ? Was it because Pete sang randy, racy songs and thus offended the moral scruples of the community? Hell no. Just for the simple act of political expression of not telling the various `distinguished' Congressional committees down in old Washington in the 1950's whether he was or was not a communist. Kid's stuff now but then it meant your life and livelihood if you gave the wrong answer, or worst, no answer. This little documentary about the big life of America's most well known folksinger is one of the better efforts produced in this American Masters series. For one thing it is nice to have homage paid to a man while he still breathes. For another this piece is filled with Pete Seeger music of his own composition and that of others that he worked with.The above paragraph is just my little valentine to the work of the man. Make no mistake Pete stands, and has most always stood, for a different political perspective than mine but one must cut cultural workers a certain amount of political slack when it comes to their craft. This documentary, complete with the obligatory `talking heads', including Pete's wife, brother and children, traces the very radical early career of a man who also ranks as an important scholarly source of folk music history. It traces his trials and tribulations through the infamous `red scare', his reemergence during the folk revival of the 1960's, the attempts to clean up New York's Hudson River and his later work with children and whoever else needed some help.I take issue with his concept of thinking globally and acting locally. The reverse is necessary- think locally and act globally. But what can one say negatively about a man who has given us such musical good news. A short list of my favorites- ""Oh, Had I A Golden Thread"",""Turn, Turn, Turn (his adaption), ""Last Train to Nuremberg"" and ""Little Boxes"" hardly does justice to the man. Oh well, enough of the valentines, except one thing. Something is definitely out of joint with the times when, as shown here, Pete is being feted by then President Clinton at the White House for good citizenship.

For fans and admirers of the wonderful Pete and the history of political folk music, this is a must.  Parts of this documentary had me near to tears, not through sadness but just the sheer uplifting nature of Pete's long life of unselfish commitment to making the world a better place for all of us.  Fighting for civil rights, education, freedom of speech, the environment, standing his ground against unprincipled forces; all achieved in his own unique way.  No grandstanding, just going about it with dignity and purpose.  Of course, there's lots of great music and comments from Pete and his family and his music pals like Arlo Guthrie, Tom Paxton, Joan Baez, Ronnie Gilbert, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Peter, Paul and Mary. Some very nice extras include some cute home movies by Pete and wife Toshi, especially the ""Wrapping Paper"" short.

660131,A680RUE1FDO8B,B00005JPY4,Jerry Saperstein,"[2, 6]","Pete Seeger is a great folklorist and singer. As a kid I loved him. It wasn't until I was in my teens that I learned Seeger was not only an avowed Communist, but a supporter of the murderous tyrant Josef Stalin. Not until 1993, at the earliest, did Seeger admit to ""his major blind spot opposing social injustice in America while supporting the most tyrannical of regimes abroad"". (NYTimes, 9/1/07.)This film. calling itself a documentary, spends a lot of time claiming that Seeger was oppressed for being a Communist without acknowledging that the Soviet regime controlled the US Communist Party and did seek to manipulate, if not replace, the US system of government. It also fails to mention that until the apology noted above, Seeger supported the Stalinist regime that was responsible for allegedly 70 million murders and the imprisonment and virtual enslavement of hundreds of millions more.Seeger, in short, is no hero and this film goes to extraordinary lengths to hide the truth.He is, however, a great singer and in many ways a laudable social activist. The film traces Seeger's roots from early experience in a musical family through his days as a folklorist through the present. There's lots of good Seeger music from the past seven decades and interviews with the usual bunch of gushing celebrities. Of particular interest, is Seeger's relationship with his wife and children. It is difficult to understand that a man who supported tyrannies all over the world that wrecked so many families could be so loving of his own family.I still enjoy Pete Seeger's music, but I doubt that I will ever develop a liking for the man himself.

Pete Seegar used music to make people bridge the gaps between them to defeat hatred, war and a less than perfect world. The documentary goes along at a very good pace with excellent cinematography and I was never once bored. The archival footage is fascinating to watch--especially the footage of Seeger on foreign television and his appearance in 1967 on The Smother Brothers television show. We also get great commentaries by talented peers of Pete Seegar; Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, Arlo Guthrie, Mary Travers and Peter Yarrow all provide us with good insights, just to name a few.The documentary essentially traces Pete's life in chronological order. We get a glimpse of how Pete's parents broke up after his mother, a frustrated musician, left her husband and children to go have a life of her own. Pete's father got a job in Washington, D.C. but with the help of a scholarship and some meager family funds he was able to go to Harvard although he eventually dropped out. Pete also began to get involved with the Communist political party because they were opposed to prejudice against African-Americans and they believed in the power of the unions to strike. Pete worked very hard to support civil rights; and this is well documented with great archival footage in this film. Of course, when he was blacklisted by the government's Un-American Activities Committee, Pete was forced away from television and radio appearances and it took quite some while for him to make his way back to the larger mainstream audience.But this never truly stopped Pete. He sang in schools to make younger people see the power of his peaceful message which he delivered through folk music; and the documentary shows how he wrote a book or two about the power of folk music to enhance the life of the common, everyday man in America. We also learn how Pete eventually worked as a member of The Weavers who reunited at Carnegie Hall after being blacklisted as a group for several years. That Carnegie Hall concert was a smashing success, to say the least!The documentary even shows how Pete was able to spearhead plans to clean up the Hudson River which flows near where he and his wife of over 60 years, Toshi, live in upstate New York. Overall, this is very sweet and impressive at once.The DVD comes with some deleted scenes and a few other extras. Great!I highly recommend this DVD for fans of Pete Seegar; and of course fans of folk music will not be disappointed. Pete Seegar may not be working much these days because of his advanced age; but he continues to make a strong impact on people everywhere whenever his great music is performed.",5,"the life and times of Pete Seeger, living legend",1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,2753,"['Pete', 'Seeger', 'Power', 'Song', 'well-crafted', 'documentary', 'life', 'times', 'legendary', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Pete', 'Seegar', 'used', 'music', 'make', 'people', 'bridge', 'gaps', 'defeat', 'hatred', 'war', 'less', 'perfect', 'world', 'documentary', 'along', 'very', 'good', 'pace', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'was', 'never', 'once', 'bored', 'archival', 'footage', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'especially', 'footage', 'Seeger', 'foreign', 'television', 'appearance', '1967', 'Smother', 'Brothers', 'television', 'show', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'commentaries', 'talented', 'peers', 'Pete', 'Seegar', 'Bruce', 'Springsteen', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Arlo', 'Guthrie', 'Mary', 'Travers', 'Peter', 'Yarrow', 'provide', 'good', 'insights', 'just', 'name', 'few.The', 'documentary', 'essentially', 'Pete', 'life', 'chronological', 'order', 'get', 'glimpse', 'how', 'Pete', 'parents', 'broke', 'up', 'mother', 'frustrated', 'musician', 'left', 'husband', 'children', 'go', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'Pete', 'father', 'got', 'job', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'help', 'scholarship', 'meager', 'family', 'funds', 'was', 'able', 'go', 'Harvard', 'eventually', 'dropped', 'out', 'Pete', 'also', 'began', 'get', 'involved', 'Communist', 'political', 'party', 'were', 'opposed', 'prejudice', 'African-Americans', 'believed', 'power', 'unions', 'strike', 'Pete', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'support', 'civil', 'rights', 'well', 'documented', 'great', 'archival', 'footage', 'film', 'course', 'when', 'was', 'blacklisted', 'government', 'Un-American', 'Activities', 'Committee', 'Pete', 'was', 'forced', 'away', 'television', 'radio', 'appearances', 'took', 'quite', 'while', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'larger', 'mainstream', 'audience.But', 'never', 'truly', 'stopped', 'Pete', 'sang', 'schools', 'make', 'younger', 'people', 'see', 'power', 'peaceful', 'message', 'delivered', 'folk', 'music', 'documentary', 'how', 'wrote', 'book', 'two', 'power', 'folk', 'music', 'enhance', 'life', 'common', 'everyday', 'man', 'America', 'also', 'learn', 'how', 'Pete', 'eventually', 'worked', 'member', 'Weavers', 'who', 'reunited', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'being', 'blacklisted', 'group', 'several', 'years', 'Carnegie', 'Hall', 'concert', 'was', 'smashing', 'success', 'say', 'least', 'documentary', 'even', 'how', 'Pete', 'was', 'able', 'spearhead', 'plans', 'clean', 'up', 'Hudson', 'River', 'where', 'wife', '60', 'years', 'Toshi', 'live', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'Overall', 'very', 'sweet', 'impressive', 'once.The', 'DVD', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'few', 'other', 'extras', 'Great', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'fans', 'Pete', 'Seegar', 'course', 'fans', 'folk', 'music', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Pete', 'Seegar', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'working', 'much', 'days', 'advanced', 'age', 'make', 'strong', 'impact', 'people', 'everywhere', 'whenever', 'great', 'music', 'performed']",N/A

If you don't know who Pete Seeger is, then learning his story, purposes, and methods will likely be worthwhile for you.  This film presents a concise and fast-paced history of his artistry and advocacy.Seeger used his talents and gifts to promote causes he believed in.  He used songs to attempt to effect social changes.  It would be easy to call much of his music didactic, but I think Seeger consciously conceded the loss of some of the beauties of indirectness and metaphor in order to speak more clearly to more people about issues he believed deserved more public attention and change.Generations come and go quickly.  Fashions and artistic trends of the world move forward quickly, leaving most things from a couple generations ago behind and mostly forgotten.  Seeger sang to keep good ideas in circulation and to keep public dialogues going on less visible and often unpopular-to-view issues.Seeger did not seek to keep others in the ideas of the past.  He often used older musical styles to express newer ideas for the future.  That is maybe what separated him from many folk and bluegrass musicians.He spurred on and helped to create the 60s and 70s folk music movements, movements that were not interested in preserving the old and conservative, but rather were interested in stimulating new and critical thinking.Most of us will not be remembered primarily for what we did to strengthen and improve ourselves.  If we are remembered, it will more likely be for what we did to strengthen and improve others in our generation and future generations.

That said, I was aware of the allegations about his political views.  The DVD is well produced and captures the illogic of the red-baiting that was present in the past.

The sight of a batch of college-age young folks sitting around singing folk songs is refreshing. The DVD reveals that Pete Seeger has musiciological substance than I had recognized.

660137,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JPY4,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 12]","The glorious documentary ""Pete Seeger:  The Power of Song"" provides us with a beautiful and inspiring portrait of a man whose life and music helped to define an era.  Seeger has always been an artist who viewed music not merely as a form of entertainment but as a vehicle for social change and as a means of bringing people together.  And it is this legacy that is captured so movingly in ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""The movie chronicles Seeger's beginnings as the son of musicians who would travel around the countryside bringing classical music to the rural masses.  The movie then goes on to depict Seeger's introduction to folk music by the very people his parents would play for; his becoming an activist for worker and civil rights during the Great Depression; his riding the rails with Woody Guthrie, inspiring people with pro-labor ballads.  It then moves on to his time as a soldier during World War II (no reflexive anti-military guy he); his marriage in 1943 to Toshi, a fellow folk singer and the true love of his life; his building his own house in the woods for him and his family to live in; his acceptance, then eventual rejection of Communism as a workable ideology (ironic, considering what was to happen to him soon afterwards).  Then we move onto the late 1940s when Seeger hit it big as a member of The Weavers, the first group to truly bring folk music to a mass audience.  And we get to see just how quickly one can tumble from the pinnacle of fame, for the band soon fell victim to McCarthy Era hysteria, being suddenly blacklisted - its concerts cancelled and its records destroyed - for what were perceived to be its communist leanings.  Seeger himself appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the mid-1950s, where he refused to sign a loyalty oath, resulting in his being blacklisted from TV for the next 17 years (it was the Smothers Brothers who eventually had the courage to buck the establishment and bring him back on).Yet, all during this time, through his programs for kids, he remained instrumental in creating a folk-music revival that swept the nation and that would provide the soundtrack for much of the social activism that was to flower in the 1960s - activism that came in the form of minority rights, antiwar protests and increased environmental awareness (Seeger spearheaded the drive to clean up the Hudson River).  The ultimate irony - and the ultimate tribute to the effectiveness of Seeger's position - comes near the end of the movie, as we see him receiving the coveted Kennedy Center Honor before an audience of tear-stained fans and fellow musicians.  Not bad for a man who, just a few decades earlier, had been accused by the American government of being everything from a Commie to a subversive to a traitor, merely for staying true to his conviction that all men and women should be treated with dignity and respect and that they should strive to live in harmony together - and for expressing that sentiment in his music.  As Seeger's son says, it only goes to show just how right the man and his causes were all along - and how persistence in the cause of Good, no matter how long the struggle, will always pay off in the end.In addition to priceless archival footage of Seeger performing at various stages in his career, director Jim Brown provides a generous helping of interviews to help round out Seeger's story.  The interviewees run the gamut from friends and family members to recognizable artists such as Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Natalie Maines, Arlo Guthrie, Peter Yarrow, Mary Travers and Bonnie Raitt - musicians and songwriters who owe so much to Seeger for their own artistry and success.  And, best of all, Seeger himself, now a frail man in his 80s but still endowed with a tremendous passion and hope for the world, is given the chance to relate the story of his life in his own words.And, of course, always there is the music, providing a stirring backdrop to the man's life - songs he either wrote or sang (or both) like ""If I Had a Hammer,"" ""Goodnight Irene,"" ""Turn, Turn, Turn,"" ""Guantanamera,"" ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?,""  ""We Shall Overcome,"" each and every one of them a classic and a standard.While watching this film, I couldn't help but be struck by the eerie parallels between that earlier period and our own.  In an era in which people are once again being demonized as ""Marxists,"" ""Socialists,"" and ""Communists"" by loudmouthed, know-nothing  demagogues, Seeger's story and the stances he took couldn't be more timely or relevant. It's more than a bit depressing to realize that issues and struggles that many of us believed to have been long resolved and long settled have once again reared their ugly heads.  It's a reminder, sorely needed apparently, that the fight for social justice never truly ends, and that it takes all of us working together to bring about that world of equality and human advancement that we should all be striving towards every single day of our lives.  And, more than anything, that's been the message of Seeger's life and music for nigh unto three-quarters of a century now.I honestly cannot imagine a more uplifting and inspiring movie than ""Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.""",5,Instant Inspiration!,1280016000,"07 25, 2010",2010,5239,"['glorious', 'documentary', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Power', 'Song', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'portrait', 'man',

With commentary by Joan Baez, his contemporary and Bruce Springsteen, who was strongly influenced by him, viewers see the diversity and breadth of his social and political activism.Seeger easily takes his place among American folk heroes, but even more exciting is his popularity around the world.

It was great and I recommended it to friends. Now it's coming out on video and even more folks will get the chance to see it. Plus there's some neat bonus features.The 90-minute film features not only interviews with Pete but his son and daughters and one of his brothers as well as his well-known sister Peggy. There's great archival footage from the 1950s that I've never seen elsewhere and quite a few full performances as well. Director Jim Brown did his research well and Pete's lifelong wife Toshi is Executive Producer, which helped access some family archival materials.Ronnie Gilbert makes some brief comments but Fred Hellerman (still living in CT) is surprisingly missing.You'll learn new things about Pete (he subscribes to The Wall St. Journal!) as well.There are one or two ""celebrity"" folks interviewed like Bonnie Raitt. But the strangest is Bruce Springsteen. There are three sections where Bruce expounds on Pete (never mentioning the ""Seeger Sessions"" at all). And every time he refers to Pete in the past tense! Speingsteen says: ""He had....."", ""He was...."".  It's like Pete is gone!Sadly Pete was not a choice for the Nobel Peace prize this year. (I agree with Al Gore as a choice but this should have been Pete's year!) If there ever was a way to communicate to the Nobel Committee that Pete deserves the award, this film would certain make the strongest case. I wonder if they've seen it? Anyway, you should.When I saw the film upon it's release I hoped that the DVD would include as bonus features full performances of the brief excerpts included in the film.
