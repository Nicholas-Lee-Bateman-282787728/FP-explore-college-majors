Any fan of Tommy Lee Jones should love it. Fans of adventure and pirate movies will enjoy it as well. Jones and Michael O'Keefe are a good team in this lighthearted action movie. The story, acting, music, and directing are borderline great. Unfortunatly it didn't catch on at the time of it's release and most of the following is people that lucked upon it on TV or at a rental store.Any fan of movies like &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; or &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; will probably enjoy it. A great adventure movie with a mix of Indiana Jones and Pirates. We can only hope with the release of movies like &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; on DVD this won't be overlooked since it is a notch above several all ready available.It may not measure up to &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; but it still has a good deal of fun and action.

Nate and Hayes is one of those movies.Nate and Hayes is about pirates in the South Pacific.  Tommy Lee Jones plays Captain Nate &quot;Bully&quot; Hayes while Michael O'Keefe plays the starchy minister, Jenny Seagrove plays O'Keefe's wife and Australian actor Max Phipps is the evil Captain Ben Pease.The action starts when Captain Pease raids the island right after the marriage ceremony for the minister and his wife.  The minister is struck unconscious and his wife is taken prisoner by the evil Pease.  The minister then joins forces with Captain Hayes who has his own score to settle with Pease and that's when the fun begins!Nate and Hayes is a much underappreciated family film classic.

Watching it is like watching an old B movie serial with more modern effects like color and scripts.Jones plays Capt. Bully Hayes, a south seas scoundrel with a reputation for piracy. He is hired to transport a young couple to the island where they plan to marry and become missionaries. The young lady on her way to be married is a bit nervous. She does not seem like she is ready to settle down to such a calm life. Even so, she is resigned to it but not without a little act of defiance. She takes some of her money to ""invest"" in the dashing captain's maritime exploits.After dropping the couple off, the couple's island is raided by slavers who think they have killed everyone except the girl, who is naturally taken prisoner. They try to leave evidence implicating Hayes and plan to use the girl to trade to a barbarian king in exchange for basing rights for the expanding German navy. She is to be a human sacrifice in the style right out of the Saturday matinees.Meanwhile, Capt. Hayes has decided that he has a romantic interest in the girl and turns back to get her. He find a very hacked of fianc&eacute; who believes that Hayes is the cause of all his woes. Together, this unlikely pair head out to rescue the damsel in distress, take on the Imperial German Navy and clear the Captain's name.The film is full of unlikely plot devices and rube Goldberg contraptions but it does have a certain brassiness about it. It was fun to watch but is certainly not worth keeping near at hand.
