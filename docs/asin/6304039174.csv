Until Annie announces she's going to have a baby. George Banks? A grandfather? He always knew that Bryan was up to no good - he, for one thing, is too young to be a grandfather!

This sequel,to the remake of the original is just entitled FATHER OF THE BRIDE PART II. It's very much like Alan Alda's A NEW LIFE because George Banks(Steve Martin) like Alda in his film,becomes a grandfather and a father again. George drives home from his company Sidekicks on a beautiful fall day(cool air and gradually falling multi-colored leaves). At the Banks' home,where Bryan MacKenzie's(George Newbern) parents David and Joanna were also,George,Nina(Diane Keaton),David and Joanna learn,when their respective children show up,that Annie(Kimberly williams) and Bryan will become parents. Annie's brother Matt(Kieran Culkin) learns also. George gets a makeover in one scene(he dyes his hair). He surprises his wife Nina,saying ""I look like the guy you married!"". Also he presents some sexy lingerie to Nina,which she refuses since she is a grandmother-to-be(""Hey,you're not my grandmother!"",George quipps.). The lingerie led to an unexpected preganancy for Nina,which is her third. The Bankses experience some faults with their house. George and Nina agreed to sell it if something else went wrong. So termites attacked,and on the real estate market the Bankses' house at 24 Maple Drive in San Marino,California,went. The new owner had not yet closed and sent a bulldozer with a wrecking ball to demolish the house. George decides to take the house back(""Don't destroy my memories!""). He tells the wrecking crew how he painted the shutters of the Banks' home and accidentally broke a window with a flying frisbee. So the ""new owner"" sends the wrecking crew away,bringing relief to George. Around the same time,George's and Nina's third child and Annie's and Bryan's child are born in the very same hospital. At a clinic,George and Nina run into Franc Eggelhoffer,the same European guy who coordinated Annie's wedding. Franc(Martin Short) learns of Nina's and Annie's respective pregnancies(""modder and dodder prognont togodder?"",as pronounced by Franc). So Nina and Annie have a baby shower together.

How juvenile can you get? Even if you bid it farewell, it won't go away. but I respect your opinion,even if it may not sound like it.  On with the movie review. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Most sequels are boring and terrible, but this one really followed up with the first one. The fact that all of the characters were back from the first movie really helped. And how many movies have this kind of plot? Have you ever heard of another movie with a mother and daughter getting pregnant at the same time? And Martin's character, George Banks, was a really sweet man to be able to help out both his wife and daughter at the same time, without blowing his top, and he was a high-strung man to begin with. Short's character, Franck, is back with the same kooky qualities, and his driving to the hospital and all added much humor. I was happy to see some vulnerability in this movie, such as Keaton and Williams crying over the littlest thing-like all mothers do. The baby room, the deliveries, everything was so sweet. There isn't anything nasty or vengeful about it- it's just a soft, warm movie about a normal family with two babies on the way,with bright hopes for the future. Everything just seemed to pull together. The plot may be a bit predictable, but it's still great just to kick back and enjoy this two-hour movie accompanied with an emotional uplift.

This is perhaps the best movie rental I have seen this year.I have followed the career of Steve Martin since the 1970's.  His comedy routine was really over the top in terms of his nightclub and television presentation.  Lots of sight gags and exaggerated funny stories.  I guess I expected the same sort of humor from this movie and fortunately, was I wrong.  Instead, Martin has a genius for a very suble humor that is absolutely hilarious.  I laughed out loud and actually fell on the floor laughing in one scene.A well-done movie should make you laugh, cry, and think.  This movie does it all.  Watch it with someone you love, and just see the emotions this movie evokes.  It has something for every age and is not offensive whatsoever.  I congratulate the producers for giving the American public a film that the entire family can appreciate and be entertained by.This movie immediately rocketed to the top of my ""funniest movie ever"" category.  And it is because I could relate to the situations presented, the feelings of the characters, and the inherent humor in the lives of the characters.Yet, this movie is not just a comedy.  It is a coming of age movie for baby-boomers, and for twenty-somethings.  It made me laugh out loud, evokes copious tears many times, and made me think about what is really important in life.  The core message of the film is that family and relationships are what makes life worth living.  Steve Martin (as George), has a telling moment at the hospital as both his wife and his daughter are about to deliver at the same time.  Martin turns to the young female doctor and says, ""Doctor, these two women are my entire life"".  (In other words, I love them so much; don't let anything happen to them!). That one line is the essence of the film, and life in general.Diane Keaton's smile is so lovely, and she is the perfect foil for the serious George (Steve Martin).  There is quality in every aspect of this film.  The supporting cast is exceptional, with Martin Short's characterization of the obviously gay wedding/baby shower planner a sure laugh producer!This is a 5-star movie in my book.  I love the sets, the background music, the acting, - everything!  Most highly recommended!

The planet of not wanting to die by a drive by shooting.I had to virtually wrestle this back into my DVD case and out of my mum's hands.

And that's what happened in this case.This goes into more detail with The Banks Family and also with the MacKenzie clan.It starts off with Kimberly Williams character, as Annie Banks becoming pregnant, and with Steve Martin's character returning as George Banks, who then feels really old after he learns of his daughter's pregnancy and the fact he's becoming a grandpa. So then he spends half of the film trying to become young again. There's also the fact that they try to sell their house, the classic lovely house from the first film...and also Nina not feeling very well and then feeling old herself. However, this is the kicker, then she becomes pregnant as well at the same time her daughter is. That's where it gets to be a little &quot;out there.&quot; This time around the film is more about growing up and learning to cope with the responsibilties of parent hood. The movie though I do have to say is really touching and has a lot of fun moments. Especially and not to worry, Martin Short comes back as the very funny and histarical Franck Eggelhoffer. (I had to look that name up :) Martin and Steve Martin paired together make a wonderful comedy team. Also in this one it's also touching to see to characters so different, Franck and George bond together with the births of Georges baby and his daughter's baby. This film is a little more out there, a little more slow, but it is a classic comedy and I love how everyone returned. You can tell the entire cast loved to work together which is always fun to see. All in all I think you'll enjoy this film.For the DVD it has more than the first one does. It's still in Widescreen formate, but it also has more trailers, a great behind the scene's commentary with Steve Martin and Martin Short where they kind of interview themselves its funny!

He's married, has one daughter who is married (the story of which was brought forward in the original Father of the Bride), and has a son.  Now that his daughter is married, Martin thinks that he can finally start from scratch with his wife and move to a condo.  It turns out that just isn't going to happen.Why?Well, during a celebration of his renewed independence--it turns out that he inpregnates his wife, and thus he is going to be a father.  It's a bit shocking to him, but it happens.  So lo and behold, his daughter and wife are both pregnant.  The story from there showcases what love and respect he has for both of them.  Although it was intended as comedy, it is not a ha-ha laughter type of film.  I just couldn't laugh at most moments.

I had to make myself watch it in its entirety. It was too unrealistic; a mother and daughter being pregnant at the same time, giving birth on the same exact day, in the same hospital across the hall from one another. Give me a break. And what are the chances of you buying your house back one day after you sell it by just one stoke of a pen by simply reaching into your pocket and whipping out a $100,000 check? Yeah, I see that happen all the time. And gee whiz, Annie's husband walks into the hospital after a business trip in Tokyo just in the nick of time, how convenient. And is it too much to ask to have just one movie where the pregnant woman gets a normal ride to the hospital? The wild ride to the hospital scene is played (Look Who's Talking?, Nine Months). And just what kind of job did the father of the bride have? A baby suite? How fortunate we all would be if we could toss thousands of dollars on a single room in a house that's only going to be used for a couple of months. Now that's what I call living! And Franck, not only does he coordinate weddings but he throws in baby showers here and there as well. Oh, and he also designs baby suites. Maybe he does barmitzvahs too. This movie would have been a lot better if it only focused on Annie being pregnant. The Banks having 3 children spread out across 3 different generations was a bit much. ""Is that your grandbaby?"" ""No, that's my daughter."" ""Hey, is that your sister?"" ""No, that's my aunt."" ""Hey, it was nice meeting your brother."" ""Are you kidding me, that's my nephew!""  There were no funny moments in this movie and seeing Steve Martin as a brunette, even if it was only briefly, was just painful. His hair has been gray ever since I can remember and he should keep it that way at all times. Do yourself a favor and pass on this movie. The first one is much better.

As the comfortable family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a catalyst for a kind of rebirth of his attitude on life when he and his wife, Nina, find how their lives are about to change as well. This movie is a very warm and funny family movie. I enjoyed every minute of it because it was very real. Some may disagree but there are a lot of people who may of had this type of situation. I loved that Martin Short was in the sequel because I love his comedy and he made the movie very funny.

397246,A35V32HZEGZH04,6304039174,"W. Easley ""Opa""","[3, 3]","Father of the Bride 2 is a perfect cure for the doldrums.  My wife and I had never seen this movie.  One evening after a particularly tough day, she saw this DVD on our shelves and suggested that we watch it.  She hit play and the night changed.  After several hours (we always get interrupted with pseudo emergencies when watching a movie) we slowly felt the tension leave and laughter began to replace the gloom.Father of the Bride 2 stars Steve Martin as George Banks.  George has recovered from the nerve racking experience of hosting a wedding for his daughter Anne (Kimberly Williams), and is finally ready to get on with his life.  Suddenly Anne announces that she is having a baby and George immediately has a mid life crisis.George rejects the concept of being a grandfather, spurns his age.  He tries to gain control of his life by planning to move to the seashore, and remaking his personal  appearance.  George's mid life crisis is hilarious, his actions are exaggerated, almost childish but very funny.Then his wife Nina (Diane Keaton) announces she is pregnant and the fun really begins.  George becomes unglued, Nina resents his attitude, and George discovers that his crisis is self inflicted.This is a very fun filled movie.  Steve Martin is at his best.  Both Diane Keaton and Kimberly Williams are brilliant in their roles as the wife and daughter.  As a generous addition, Martin Short plays a huge roll as planner of baby showers, interior decorator who remodels houses, and a zany supporter for George.I highly recommend this film for anyone wanting a funny enjoyable evening.",4,Grandfather George,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,1598,"['Father', 'Bride', '2', 'perfect', 'cure', 'doldrums', 'wife', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'One', 'evening', 'particularly', 'tough', 'day', 'saw', 'DVD', 'shelves', 'suggested', 'watch', 'hit', 'play', 'night', 'changed', 'several', 'hours', 'always', 'get', 'interrupted', 'pseudo', 'emergencies', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'slowly', 'felt', 'tension', 'leave', 'laughter', 'began', 'replace', 'gloom.Father', 'Bride', '2', 'stars', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'George', 'Banks', 'George', 'recovered', 'nerve', 'racking', 'experience', 'hosting', 'wedding', 'daughter', 'Anne', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'finally', 'ready', 'get', 'life', 'Suddenly', 'Anne', 'announces', 'having', 'baby', 'George', 'immediately', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis.George', 'concept', 'being', 'grandfather', 'age', 'gain', 'control', 'life', 'planning', 'move', 'seashore', 'remaking', 'personal', 'appearance', 'George', 'mid', 'life', 'crisis', 'hilarious', 'actions', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'almost', 'childish', 'very', 'funny.Then', 'wife', 'Nina', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'pregnant', 'fun', 'really', 'George', 'unglued', 'Nina', 'attitude', 'George', 'discovers', 'crisis', 'self', 'inflicted.This', 'very', 'fun', 'filled', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'best', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'are', 'brilliant', 'roles', 'wife', 'daughter', 'generous', 'addition', 'Martin', 'Short', 'huge', 'roll', 'planner', 'baby', 'showers', 'interior', 'decorator', 'who', 'houses', 'zany', 'supporter', 'George.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'funny', 'enjoyable', 'evening']",Father of the Bride Part II VHS
397247,AP3B615GM191G,6304039174,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","The first ""Father of the Bride"" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin's great comedic ""Dad"" character with the emotions of marrying off his ""only"" (to that point!) daughter.  However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor.  Thankfully, ""Father of the Bride II"" does not fall into this trap.With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather.  Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George's wife Nina (Diane Keaton).  Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women!Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments.  Whereas the first film captured George's equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George's identity crisis.  With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family.Overall, this film is just as good as the original.  The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare.  Let's just say that if a ""Grandfather of the Bride"" were in the works, I would be first in line.",5,A (Rare) Good Sequel,1219104000,"08 19, 2008",2008,1704,"['first', 'Father', 'Bride', 'film', 'made', 'hold', 'sides', 'laughter', 'tears', 'meshing', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'great', 'comedic', 'Dad', 'character', 'emotions', 'marrying', 'off', 'only', 'point', 'daughter', 'However', 'when', 'viewing', 'sequel', 'great', 'film', 'was', 'cautious', 'too', 'often', 'sequels', 'play', 'exactly', 'same', 'type', 'laughs', 'original', 'think', 'Ace', 'Ventura', 'When', 'Nature', 'Calls', 'thus', 'fail', 'deliver', 'predecessor', 'Thankfully', 'Father', 'Bride', 'II', 'not', 'fall', 'trap.With', 'daughter', 'Annie', 'Kimberly', 'Williams', 'who', 'up', 'acting', 'skills', 'film', 'compared', 'first', 'announcing', 'pregnant', 'father', 'George', 'Martin', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'becoming', 'grandfather', 'Further', 'complicating', 'things', 'adding', 'bit', 'hilarity', 'rather', 'unexpected', 'pregnancy', 'George', 'wife', 'Nina', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Thus', 'coming', 'terms', 'new', 'identity', 'George', 'also', 'must', 'deal', 'two', 'pregnant', 'women', 'Not', 'only', 'film', 'filled', 'comedic', 'genius', 'though', 'also', 'just', 'as', 'many', 'not', 'more', 'touching', 'emotional', 'moments', 'first', 'film', 'captured', 'George', 'equal', 'parts', 'happiness', 'sadness', 'seeing', 'daughter', 'leave', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'potent', 'regarding', 'George', 'identity', 'crisis', 'whole', 'life', 'flux', 'comedic', 'portion', 'film', 'George', 'remember', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'first', 'place', 'family.Overall', 'film', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'combination', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'smart', 'not', 'crude', 'humor', 'welcome', 'balance', 'counterpoint', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'Grandfather', 'Bride', 'were', 'works', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'line']",Father of the Bride Part II VHS
