The documentary discusses such subjects as Joe Kennedy's involement in bootlegging, JFK's medical problems in the 1950's & early 1960's and all of JFK's affairs.

Kennedy and his progeny.The American Experience footage, interviews and comments by those who were there, make this the definitive look back at the point in time that forever changed America.  We haven't been the same since.  This saga is the end of our national innocence.  It's as real a look at what happened as we'll see in our lifetime.

The great David McCullough handles narration and, as usual, does a splendid job (What a voice! What a writer!). This PBS series is well done with a good mix of vintage footage and technical/ production effects. While there are no great revelations, this is a nice overview of the Kennedys; an all-in-one-place dvd, so to speak. Buy it! :)Vince PalamaraP.S.
