913667,A2U83VDVJMAB2U,B0009VBTQ4,Brian Baker,"[32, 69]","I wish I could give it minus stars. This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Bochco in July of 2005 after watching the premiere episode:""Dear Mr. Bochco;I just watched the premiere episode of your new series ""Over There"" on the FX network and wanted to share with you my thoughts on the program. This is the first time in my life I've been motivated to send a letter to the producer of a show - that's how strongly I feel about what I just saw.First, some background. I'm 56 years old and I was raised in a foreign service family. I enlisted in the Army in 1969 and served in Vietnam from summer of 1969 to summer of 1970. I'm a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I make it a point to stay current on military affairs. My daughter is 19 years old, and over the last couple of years has had several of her friends enlist in the Army and Marines. Some have served in Iraq; a couple have died in the service, at least one of them during combat operations in Iraq. They're all very proud of their service, and justifiably so. I mention these things so that you know I'm speaking with a very intimate knowledge of military life.That having been said, I thought what I saw tonight was simply ludicrous, and I'm going to tell you why.Let's start with the political tenor of the show. The Vietnam War ended 30 years ago; you may have noticed. It was in all the papers. And yet what we got tonight was a rehash of the same old, trite anti-war tripe that was so popular in the 70's. Part of that was the caricatural characterizations of the troops that was also so popular back in the bad old days: the bellicose and disaffected sergeant who somehow gets away with yelling at his superiors when he's not yelling at or threatening his subordinates; the incompetent junior officer; the over-educated enlisted man (I mean come on - a Cornell man is a private?); the over-indulgent senior officer/father figure who insults the lieutenant in front of the troops; the nave high school football quarterback; etcetera, etcetera. A poor man's version of Stone's ""Platoon"".Then there are the tactical issues. You've got a sergeant leading a six man fire team; that's the job of a corporal. A sergeant would be leading a full squad. As far as I could see, those six people were the only US troops opposing whatever force was in the mosque. A bit undermanned, wouldn't you say? And in their position behind the berm, they're in line about three yards apart. One mortar round or grenade could wipe out the whole group. For a sergeant who keeps yelling about how he's going to keep his troops alive, ""Screamer"" was certainly doing a very poor job of it. And that's another thing, why are all those soldiers having very loud conversations while they're supposedly holding a night position? I almost busted a gut laughing at that one.I could go on, but I think you get the point. Basically, in trying to revisit the anti-war hyperbole of the Vietnam War era, you've grossly misrepresented the soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen who are serving our country so nobly in the Middle East. You are doing them a huge disservice, and frankly I think your characterizations are insulting to them. It would be even more insulting if the show wasn't so silly on so many levels.On a personal note, I hope FX yanks this show off the air. In aid of that possibility, I'm forwarding to them, via email, a copy of this letter.""Bochco did have the good grace to write back and ask me to try a few more episodes and give the show a chance, which I did, including trying to watch another episode on FX last night. I've seen nothing to change the opinions I stated in my first letter to him.In my opinion, this show stinks, and does a grave disservice to our military. Don't buy the DVDs, don't watch the show, write FX a letter of complaint and demand they yank this turkey off the air.",1,I'm a vet and hate this show,1137888000,"01 22, 2006",2006,3852,"['wish', 'could', 'give', 'minus', 'stars', 'copy', 'letter', 'wrote', 'Bochco', 'July', '2005', 'watching', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Mr.', 'Bochco', 'just', 'watched', 'premiere', 'episode', 'new', 'series', 'FX', 'network', 'wanted', 'share', 'thoughts', 'program', 'first', 'time', 'life', ""'ve"", 'been', 'motivated', 'send', 'letter', 'producer', 'show', 'how', 'strongly', 'feel', 'what', 'just', 'saw.First', 'background', ""'m"", '56', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'raised', 'foreign', 'service', 'family', 'enlisted', 'Army', '1969', 'served', 'Vietnam', 'summer', '1969', 'summer', '1970', ""'m"", 'life', 'member', 'Veterans', 'Foreign', 'Wars', 'make', 'point', 'stay', 'current', 'military', 'affairs', 'daughter', '19', 'years', 'old', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'had', 'several', 'friends', 'enlist', 'Army', 'Marines', 'have', 'served', 'Iraq', 'couple', 'have', 'died', 'service', 'least', 'one', 'combat', 'operations', 'Iraq', ""'re"", 'very', 'proud', 'service', 'justifiably', 'so', 'mention', 'things', 'so', 'know', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'very', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'military', 'life.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'thought', 'what', 'saw', 'tonight', 'was', 'simply', 'ludicrous', ""'m"", 'going', 'tell', 'why.Let', 'start', 'political', 'tenor', 'show', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'ended', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'was', 'papers', 'yet', 'what', 'got', 'tonight', 'was', 'rehash', 'same', 'old', 'trite', 'anti-war', 'tripe', 'was', 'so', 'popular', '70', 'Part', 'was', 'caricatural', 'characterizations', 'troops', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'popular', 'back', 'bad', 'old', 'days', 'bellicose', 'disaffected', 'sergeant', 'who', 'somehow', 'away', 'yelling', 'superiors', 'when', 'not', 'yelling', 'threatening', 'subordinates', 'incompetent', 'junior', 'officer', 'over-educated', 'enlisted', 'man', 'mean', 'come', 'Cornell', 'man', 'private', 'over-indulgent', 'senior', 'officer/father', 'figure', 'who', 'lieutenant', 'front', 'troops', 'nave', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'quarterback', 'etcetera', 'poor', 'man', 'version', 'Stone', 'Platoon', '.Then', 'are', 'tactical', 'issues', ""'ve"", 'got', 'sergeant', 'leading', 'six', 'man', 'fire', 'team', 'job', 'corporal', 'sergeant', 'would', 'be', 'leading', 'full', 'squad', 'As', 'far', 'could', 'see', 'six', 'people', 'were', 'only', 'US', 'troops', 'opposing', 'force', 'was', 'mosque', 'bit', 'undermanned', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'position', 'berm', ""'re"", 'line', 'three', 'yards', 'apart', 'One', 'mortar', 'round', 'grenade', 'could', 'wipe', 'out', 'whole', 'group', 'sergeant', 'who', 'yelling', 'how', 'going', 'keep', 'troops', 'alive', 'Screamer', 'was', 'certainly', 'doing', 'very', 'poor', 'job', 'thing', 'why', 'are', 'soldiers', 'having', 'very', 'loud', 'conversations', ""'re"", 'supposedly', 'holding', 'night', 'position', 'almost', 'busted', 'gut', 'laughing', 'one.I', 'could', 'go', 'think', 'get', 'point', 'Basically', 'trying', 'revisit', 'anti-war', 'hyperbole', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'era', ""'ve"", 'grossly', 'misrepresented', 'soldiers', 'Marines', 'sailors', 'airmen', 'who', 'are', 'serving', 'country', 'so', 'nobly', 'Middle', 'East', 'are', 'doing', 'huge', 'disservice', 'frankly', 'think', 'characterizations', 'are', 'insulting', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'insulting', 'show', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'silly', 'so', 'many', 'levels.On', 'personal', 'note', 'hope', 'FX', 'yanks', 'show', 'air', 'aid', 'possibility', ""'m"", 'forwarding', 'email', 'copy', 'letter', 'Bochco', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'grace', 'write', 'back', 'ask', 'try', 'few', 'more', 'episodes', 'give', 'show', 'chance', 'did', 'including', 'trying', 'watch', 'episode', 'FX', 'last', 'night', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nothing', 'change', 'opinions', 'stated', 'first', 'letter', 'him.In', 'opinion', 'show', 'grave', 'disservice', 'military', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVDs', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'show', 'write', 'FX', 'letter', 'complaint', 'demand', 'yank', 'turkey', 'air']",Over There: The Battle Begins
913668,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0009VBTQ4,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[9, 14]","It wasn't long ago that I remember this one saying from a soldier of a Medal of Honor game.  He said something like, ""We don't believe in wars, but we believe in what we're fighting for in wars.""  I may not have used the quote right, but I understand what he was saying, and I think most of the soldiers out there are thinking the same.- PILOT REVIEWWhile ""Over There"" may not be the first tv series to revolve around the Iraqi warfare, this could be the best one I have seen yet.  In order to avoid the confusion (like there is), I'm reviewing the PILOT of the series, so all the flaws and changes that occur in the later episodes are for the moment unjustified; just look at the ""PILOT REVIEW"" cover title, for crying out loud!  The story and characters may be fictitous in ""Over There"", but the situation couldn't damn be any more real.When I was watching this first episode at FX, I wasn't clear if this show took place in the Gulf War or the recent war my fellow country is at the pits over.  ""Over There"" takes place in the latter, an inconclusive barrage in a realistic ""Risk"" game filled with bloodshed and social satire, where the characters of the show arrived right in the middle of a country vs. country dogfight.  This is their lives, and this is their story.Their real names were rarely spoken, so they go by their aliases: The Sergeant, Bo, Angel, Smoke, Doublepuff, Mrs. B and the other names my limited mind couldn't remember.  The Sergeant is a coerceful loudmouth who makes his soldiers follow orders, and he doesn't mind to take out his own soldier if one interferes.  Bo knows fighting, Bo knows fear, Bo knows pain, and Bo knows he might be the main character of the show.  Angel is a regular black choirboy that is stingy over racial tendecies.  Doublepuff (I think that's her name) fights for the sake of her own family, and the four-eyes whose name I couldn't remember fights for the family that doesn't want him (and I'm sure he's one of the guys that regrets being a soldier of war).  No matter what kind of personality and purpose the characters portrays, all these soldiers have something in common:  they all have a lot to lose in battle.This ain't your daddy's ""Hogan's Heroes"", this is a hardcore war show.  The TV-MA rating of ""Over There"" suggests that you're gonna have the intense violence, the sexual content, and the pure obscenity (albeit, more frequent than either violence or sex combined).  That's a good thing, cause this shows it has the grittyness to make a strong, realistic warfare.  When I was watching these soldiers hiding in the ground to avoid fire from the Iraqi soldiers, waiting for orders to pounce these terrorists scum, or experiencing a landmind during vehicular transportation, that was some crazy stuff going on.  I admit, the hiding scenes and certain conversations were testing my patience, but hey, patience reaps the rewards.Ultimately (at least, for the pilot), ""Over There"" looks to be as intense as war shows can make of it.  Some of the characters are likeable, the camera-work is inspired by ""Saving Private Ryan"", and like all war in media, the action is morbidly satisfying.  From the looks of the preview, there's gonna be more characters involved, plot-twists, and carnage to brought out more than what I see from the pilot in upcoming episodes.  As for this DVD, it's a cheap purchase, but I suggest you wait when the Season set to come out next year, with possible commentaries and more making-of featurettes, along with all to episodes to the series; presuming all the episodes are as solid as the pilot.  If there's one good thing to summarizes the series from the pilot: it has potential.- FINAL WORDS:  Welcome to war, boys.

913669,A1OCOT9XQ1FBSW,B0009VBTQ4,El Jimmy,"[6, 8]","I served in the army during operation desert shield and desert storm, so i kinda have an idea of what desert combat looks like.  There haven't been many shows or movies depicting the gulf wars (not since Three Kings and Courage Under Fire) so I was looking forward to this show.  The pilot left me wanting better.  The environment was accurate enough (just find a lot of empty space and sand) the action was pretty good, but the acting was poor. You can tell B acting and C acting when you see it.  But this is the first episode and i will watch the second, because some series do start off slow, so i'm willing to give this one a chance. But make no mistake, this is a fictional entity and shouldn't be mistaken as how war really is. I know that is the intention of the creators of these shows and movies, but there's nothing like the real thing.  The closest i've seen to feeling what war is like is the movie Platoon.  Over There is a far cry from making an accurate depiction of what war is really like.

Where were the Iraqi mothers and wives who are waiting at home for their loved ones to return?  Aren't they just as much a part of this war?  I agree with several reviewers here that this is more of the same, supposedly created not as a political statement, but as ""entertainment,"" i.e. Hollywood hokum.  But is that responsible on such a topic as this war, where actual - not storybook - people are dying?  I did not serve in Iraq, so I probably don't have the authority to speak about this like some of the writers here do.I was reminded of the great film director William Wyler, who, when World War II began, decided to enlist for the war effort and, while on fighter planes, made a film documentary about the war.  I'm afraid that generation that used their gifts toward positive ends is gone.  Beware the film maker (or writer, or artist) who says their work is not ""political.""

Surely this wouldn't be just another lame Hollywood anti-war / anti-military TV show?  I was wrong.I'll grant that nothing they show is, by itself, unrealistic.  A wife who cheats on her husband while he's overseas is not unheard of.  The media making the military look bad, sure, that happens (not only inside of the show but in the very creation of the show itself!)  Having an LT that takes orders literally, to the point of defying common sense?  It can happen.But all of these things do not happen to the same people over a 3 week period.  The show is becoming ridiculous.What are the producers trying to accomplish?  It seems the moral of the story is ""Do not stand up and fight for what you believe in or what you think is right, because if you do, your wife will cheat on you, the media will make you look bad, you'll lose a limb in combat, get addicted to morphine and maybe die"".  Wow, what a great moral.  It's like Dr. Suess.When I was in the military, most of the guys were single and those who weren't had (as far as I could tell!) happy homes.  The commanding officers were by and large competent and fair and the doctors always seemed to put common courtesy ahead of strict protocol.This show is designed to do one thing: convince people to not join the military by presenting an exaggerated picture of it to the point of being a lie.  There's plenty of interesting things you could do in a show about war without putting every single negative aspect front and center without regard for the actual rarity of it.

913673,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,B0009VBTQ4,Ron Sullivan,"[6, 8]","This is sort of a weird series in terms of what works and what doesn't.  For this review I'm going to bullet-point some things.What Works:1.  Erik Palladino- The ER alum deserves special recognition.  He's STEALING the series.  He's really that good here.2.  The production value is terrific.  I don't know where they're filming at, but they did an outstanding job designing the sets and props.  EVERYTHING looks totally authentic.3.  The story-lines in Iraq do a great job of holding my interest.  Granted, I have absolutely no idea how ""real"" any of it is or how much is ""Hollywood"", but they've never lost my attention and I've never been inclined to fast-forward anything.4.  The interplay between and characters in the unit seems completely natural and flows wonderfully.  I totally believe it as I'm watching the fire-team get to know one another and develop relationships with each other.What Doesn't:1.  Almost everything on the home front.  With the lone exception of Dumphy's alcoholic wife, I just can't seem to generate even the smallest amount of interest in ANYTHING going on at home.2.  The role of the First Lieutenant.  First it was ""Mad Cow"" then ""Underpants""; the role of the ""Idiot First Lieutenant"" is becoming the ""red-shirt ensign"" of the series.  The production team would be doing themselves a favor by filling the role for more then a four or five episode story arc.3.  The closing 'Over There' anthem.  Simply put, I hate that song.  I also can't stand that I'm forced to listen to it because it's running over the last five minutes of the episode.  Unfortunately for me though, Chris Gerolmo wrote and performs it.  It's something he's clearly proud of and he's not going to cut his own song out.  I'll just have to learn to deal with it.A lot of the problems I feel like the series has, I chalk up to this being a first year show still trying to figure out what works and what doesn't.  It simply needs a little more time to find it's way a bit and gain some polish.  There's definitly more good here then bad and I'm looking forward to a big Season Two.Note: On November 1st, FX cancelled this series.",3,Tons of Potential,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,2131,"['sort', 'weird', 'series', 'terms', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'review', ""'m"", 'going', 'bullet-point', 'things.What', 'Works:1', 'Erik', 'Palladino-', 'ER', 'alum', 'special', 'recognition', 'STEALING', 'series', 'really', 'good', 'here.2', 'production', 'value', 'terrific', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'filming', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'designing', 'sets', 'props', 'EVERYTHING', 'totally', 'authentic.3', 'story-lines', 'Iraq', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'holding', 'interest', 'Granted', 'have', 'absolutely', 'idea', 'how', 'real', 'how', 'much', 'Hollywood', ""'ve"", 'never', 'lost', 'attention', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'inclined', 'fast-forward', 'anything.4', 'interplay', 'characters', 'unit', 'completely', 'natural', 'wonderfully', 'totally', 'believe', ""'m"", 'watching', 'fire-team', 'get', 'know', 'one', 'develop', 'relationships', ""Doesn't:1"", 'Almost', 'everything', 'home', 'front', 'lone', 'exception', 'Dumphy', 'alcoholic', 'wife', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'generate', 'even', 'smallest', 'amount', 'interest', 'ANYTHING', 'going', 'home.2', 'role', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'First', 'was', 'Mad', 'Cow', 'then', 'Underpants', 'role', 'Idiot', 'First', 'Lieutenant', 'becoming', 'red-shirt', 'ensign', 'series', 'production', 'team', 'would', 'be', 'doing', 'favor', 'filling', 'role', 'more', 'then', 'four', 'five', 'episode', 'story', 'arc.3', 'closing', ""'Over"", 'anthem', 'Simply', 'put', 'hate', 'song', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', ""'m"", 'forced', 'listen', 'running', 'over', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'episode', 'Unfortunately', 'Chris', 'Gerolmo', 'wrote', 'performs', 'something', 'clearly', 'proud', 'not', 'going', 'cut', 'own', 'song', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'learn', 'deal', 'it.A', 'lot', 'problems', 'feel', 'series', 'chalk', 'up', 'being', 'first', 'year', 'show', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'simply', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'find', 'way', 'bit', 'gain', 'polish', 'definitly', 'more', 'good', 'here', 'then', 'bad', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'big', 'Season', 'Two.Note', 'November', '1st', 'FX', 'cancelled', 'series']",Over There: The Battle Begins

Americans need to support our brave troops overseas instead of abusing their reputations in the name of ""entertainment"". Like the ""Stealth"" movie just released, this series provides ""action"" for us dumb middle-Americans while inserting a healthy dose of anti-americanism for the armchair liberal set. For those people, every war is a retake on Vietnam. If you enjoyed Jane Fonda's vision of Vietnam, you'll like this program. I can't wait to see the episodes where an American soldier experiences guilt over having killed civilians or we are given a sympathetic view of a terrorist.

Not the fights, not the way the US soldiers are deployed (women are put into front line combat. Can you say I DONT THINK SO???), not the way the US soldiers fight (they never call in airstrikes, reinforcements, or use realistic tactics). The whole thing seems to be a made-up fantasy. Whoever is doing the fantisization knows very little about how our military operates.It does not show a single positive thing about the Iraq war. No soldiers are handing out toys or candy to Iraqi children. There are no scenes in which the US forces are seen as heroic or compassionate. Never is there a happy face among either the US forces or the Iraqis who have been liberated from the brutal dictator known as Saddam. Over There would never depict, for example, the REAL drama where the statue of Saddam was pulled down to a deleriously happy crowd of Iraqis who beat it with their shoes as the head was dragged through the crowd.Every US soldier seems to be either doomed to have a cheating wife or girlfriend, die or lose a limb. In fact, only a tiny fraction of US soldiers face any of these problems. Over There seems to ignore the fact that this is one of the lowest casualty wars ever fought by the US. Instead, they would rather embolden the enemy by giving them hope.
