He did fantastic in his roles. I loved seeing Juhi Chawla in this film, too. I loved the music, dancing, humor, thrills and twists to the story! It's a fun, fun, film to watch!!!",5,Fun Movie!!!,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",2012,299,"['loved', 'film', 'was', 'fun', 'see', 'contrast', 'Bablu', 'Chaudhry', 'Manu', 'Dada', 'played', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'did', 'fantastic', 'roles', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Juhi', 'Chawla', 'film', 'too', 'loved', 'music', 'dancing', 'humor', 'thrills', 'twists', 'story', 'fun', 'fun', 'film', 'watch']",Duplicate

But my movie's songs didn't have English subtitles. Watching it the 1st time was like missing half the movie without knowing what the songs meant. Thankfully, KingKhan on youtube posted the songs with subtitles, so I was able to complete the total movie picture. The movie itself is very cute; Shah Rukh Khan does this one scene as his evil self that is jawdropping; I couldn't believe he would do it; you'll know it when you see 9 1/2 wks playing in the background. HELLO! I was shrieking in delighted horror. The ending was not as satisfying as I could have wished, but it was still a good movie.",4,Undersubtitled,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",2012,720,"['was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'movie', 'seeing', 'one', 'songs', 'youtube', 'called', 'Ladna', 'Jhagadna', 'adorable', 'movie', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Watching', '1st', 'time', 'was', 'missing', 'movie', 'knowing', 'what', 'songs', 'meant', 'Thankfully', 'KingKhan', 'youtube', 'posted', 'songs', 'subtitles', 'was', 'able', 'complete', 'total', 'movie', 'picture', 'movie', 'very', 'cute', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'one', 'scene', 'evil', 'self', 'jawdropping', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'do', ""'ll"", 'know', 'when', 'see', '9', '1/2', 'wks', 'playing', 'background', 'HELLO', 'was', 'shrieking', 'delighted', 'horror', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'satisfying', 'could', 'have', 'wished', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'movie']",Duplicate
