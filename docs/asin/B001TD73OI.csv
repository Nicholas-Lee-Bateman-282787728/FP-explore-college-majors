The fouth installment (in my opinion) wasn't a good or a bad film. There was a lot of great talent from legends like Shirley Maclaine. No one can every replace Megan Follows as Anne Shirley. Like many of the reviews I have read, I was also disappointed that the character of Gilbert Blythe was killed off. The film had a lot of wholes in its plots, but it did not have the magic like the first two films. However, I really enjoy the music.

1235757,A1YLR9N1VTB7WA,B001TD73OI,"Elliott ""I am a big bookworm, an avid reader ...","[15, 15]","I got this in  the mail a couple days ago. I am a big ""Anne of Green Gables"" fan and loving all eight books by L.M. Montgomery, plus reading ""Before Green Gables"" when it came out, I was hoping this would be a good tale of Anne's life before coming to Green Gables. I have to say I was rather disappointed! Not only did it not follow Anne's true childhood it kept going back and forth to much, when it should've just stayed with Anne's childhood and then showed when she was older.I also didn't like who  the actor they picked to play Anne's father and how they switched so much of the story of Anne's beginnings around. I gave it 1 star because I  thought Hannah Endicott-Douglas superbly splendid as the young Anne Shirley, but in no way shape or form should Barbara Hershey been allowed to play the older Anne. For one she looks nothing like her and two Megan Follows should've been brought back as  the older Anne. It just didn't feel like an Anne of Green Gables movie, but some other movie that is foreign to the world and spirit of ""Anne of Green Gables.""I watched this last night and being the Anne fan that I am I thought I would love it! But I  didn't enjoy it at all. It didn't stick faithful to Anne's story at all for that being an orphan and made her father live. I couldn't get that wonderful warm feeling like I got from reading the books and watching the other Anne movies. Barbara Hershey shouldn't have been chosen as the older Anne and the fact that(spoiler warning) they made  Gilbert die, Marilla have letters from Annes father hidden from her and that it jumped around quite a lot made it not feel like an ""Anne of Green Gables"" movie at all.They should've brought Megan Follows back as Anne,  and kept Gilbert Blythe alive!!! They shouldn't have rearranged Anne's story and made it look she told falsehoods about her pass. The ending should've been how with archival footage of Matthew picking Anne up from Bright River station, the ride to Green Gables and it being decided that Anne could stay at ""Green Gables."" I wish it would've followed L.M. Montgomerys original Anne's story or the prequel book to the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series ""Before Green Gables"" by Budge Wilson. I give it 1 out 5 stars, because I didn't like how the storyline wasn't Anne at all, but the one star is for Hannah Endicott-Douglas doing good as Anne Shirley when she felt like the spirit of Anne, but Megan Follows will always be the best as Anne.I do wish they would've made a better version and followed the true storyline of the tale of ""Anne Shirley."" I am glad I didn't buy  this movie at all, but rented because it would've been a waste of money! They really ruined what should've been a pleasant experience and treasure for us fans of Anne. What we're they thinking? I just wish it followed more of the novel ""Before Green Gables."" and had the arcival footage be when Anne first came to Bright River station, was picked up by Matthew and headed to ""Green Gables.""

I stuck with it as long as I could but my revulsion grew and grew and I finally turned it off.  Folks, this is sacred turf being violated!  To invent new Anne Shirley stories to replace to authentic Anne Shirley stories makes no sense at any level but the new stories also don't match the old in intent, mood and character.  Beyond that, there is terrible miscasting and for some reason Barbara Hershey looks made up to resemble Katharine Hepburn.  She even sort of talks like her.  Huh?  Shirley Maclaine looks vexed with the script and there's--unusual for her--no shading or growth in the character.  As for the kid playing Anne, well, Anne's words come out of her mouth but she never seemed like Anne to me.  I found the story line and the travails Anne goes through exhausting.

1235762,AWWALBIY9U840,B001TD73OI,Larry Hirsch,"[8, 8]","Absolutely dreadful in every possible way.This film suggests that because of a childhood scandel involving Anne's parents, that Anne lied about being an orphan her entire life. It also suggests that Marilla kept a letter from Anne's father from her, which is something that Marilla would never, ever do.Megan Follows isn't in it. Instead, we get Barbara Hershey doing her best zombified Katherine Hepburn imitation. She breathes no life whatsoever in the character. In the extras, she even admits that she'd never seen the other 3 ""Anne"" films before she began this role, because she wanted to bring her own approach to the character. I can respect that, but when you take over a coveted role, you seriously need to at least TRY to act like the previous actress who owned that character. Barbara Hershey didn't even try. I felt like I was watching some red-haired woman named Anne who wasn't Anne Shirley Blythe.Rachel Lynde is in it for one second, looking all of 110 years old, and her only line is, ""Bye!"" Pathetic.Why does Kevin Sullivan feel the need to rewrite the back story of one of the most popular and endearing literary characters of all time? Isn't that a bit egotistical?  I mean, while we're at it, let's screw with Tom Sawyer's back story, or let's add things to Anna Karenina's past history, as well.I'm not opposed to fan fiction, nor am I opposed to creating your own story and using it in a film. However, if you insist on creating your own fan fiction in order to make a film, show some respect to the original source material, at least.And how would a small female child work in a lumber mill back then? Seriously? No way.And the little girl playing younger Anne was truly horrible. She portrayed Anne with no subtlety at all, as though she were a hyper little girl on a sugar rush in  need of Ritalin. Just awful.What truly irked me is that ""Road to Avonlea"" is set in 1903-1912. In the ""Anne 4 Official Movie Companion"" book that I got (but gave to someone recently) Kevin Sullivan changed the timeframe to 1907-1914 in order to coincide with ""Anne 3"" and ""Anne 4."" This is bothersome because several ""Road to Avonlea"" episodes CLEARLY state the year. In one season 3 episode the year is stated as being 1906. But according to Sullivan, it was really 1910 by that point.  *scratches head*  Huh???Also, the film seems rushed and hurried. The so-called ""resolution"" is rather abrupt. What was up with Amelia Thomas's sudden backstabbing? That came out of nowhere. And why?And what's the point of recreating the Lily Maid scene and the Haunted Woods scene from the first film? Why was that necessary? It completely destroys the validity of those scenes in the first ""Anne"" film.Also, when Anne first goes to Shirley Maclaine's lavish estate, she remarks at how wonderful it is. Well, in the first ""Anne"" film, when she goes to Aunt Josephone's lavish estate, she hints that she's never seen such luxury before. This is really inconsistent, and not well thought out at all. ""That's the one consolation about being poor,"" she tells Diana. ""You have to dream all this up.""And HOW is Hepzibah still alive in the 1940's? She would be around 120 years old! Come on, Kevin Sullivan. Now that's just BAD!Now for the positives:The music is breathtaking. At least the film had beautiful music in its favor.I looooove the opening image of the older Anne lounging by the sea in the chair outside the White Sands Hotel. Just ... BEAUTIFUL (even if it isn't Megan Follows, unfortunately). It really, really makes me want to be there. Of course, the scene is ruined by Anne's memories of a mother she told everyone had died when Anne was an infant. But I like to imagine that Anne is only daydreaming about what might have been had her mom survived.As for as positives, that's about it. My main issue is that Anne lied, and is not an orphan.

1235766,A1LF5XT1MOUFEZ,B001TD73OI,"Martin Miller ""marty party""","[0, 0]","Let me start off by saying that I avoided this film for years. I read countless reviews saying how terrible it was and let other peoples opinions of this film put me off from it. The general outline of the story seemed very unappealing to me (I mean Gilbert dead? SERIOUSLY!!!!). I liked the first three films but had no interest in a film with no Megan Follows, Jonathan Crombie, or any of the other actors that I knew or loved.Since the end of Road to Avonlea it seems as though Kevin Sullivan has taken some very strong artistic liberties with regards to Anne of Green Gables. The entire third filmAnne Of Green Gables - The Continuing Storywas a original story that I honestly largely enjoyed, while others found it to be complete blasphemy. The fact of the matter was that Montgomery's works while excellent books did not translate to film very well at all, so these original films all be them not true to the story were the natural direction for Sullivan's story to take.Well FINALLY I purchased the film in the Anne of Green Gables remastered box setAnne of Green Gables-Remastered Complete Colland I must say, I was very mad that I had not watched this film sooner. I found it largely enjoyable and had MANY throw backs to the previous films that honestly thrilled me.The bulk of the story is that Anne now in her late 50's is involved in writing a play that is to be performed at the White Sands (yes apparently they put plays on there now)! While writing the play she goes back to Green Gables to write. We learn a couple of things during the first few minutes of the film, Anne's son Dominic from Anne 3 is missing in action, and her beloved Husband Gilbert has died. THIS WAS THE MOST DIFFICULT PILL TO SWALLOW AND IS MY MAIN REASON FOR GIVING THIS FILM 4 STARS INSTEAD OF 5!! WHY POINTLESSLY KILL OFF GILBERT????Any way sorry....We learn that Diana's family has been staying at Green Gables for the last 30 years and while packing to move out Dina's daughter discovers some of Marilla's old letters. Among these is a letter that was apparently sent to Green Gables from Anne's father....I know what your thinking...Anne's father is dead...Well not exactly in Sullivan's interpretation. And score bonus points for us getting to see Colleen Dewhurst in a flashback ;)This sets in to advance a series of flashbacks of Anne's early years before green gables. Some of these flashbacks pull from the first novel like her time with the Thomas's. The largely original story is very disturbing and sometimes lighthearted. It tells Anne's story from the time of her mother's death up to the beginning of the first film when she's dropped off to live with the Hammond's.The film features numerous shout-outs to previous films and other gems, like seeing Diana and Anne's families. We finally see RILLA albeit briefly and also Hetty King and Rachael Lynde! They are in their 90's and still going strong. It was very heartwarming to see both of these characters back on film!I must tell you that I really ultimately did enjoy this film. I wasn't expecting to at all. I sat down to watch it with the mindset of, ""OK, I've seen the rest so just knock this last one out and never watch it again."" But, the film made a believer out of me. I know that it's not completely according to the books, but Sullivan's explanation of Anne's psyche is believable. It's very easy to see how a little girl may not tell the truth of exactly what happened to her parents, especially if one considers the circumstances Sullivan puts before us in this film. That said, if your a Anne purest how can't deal with anything except Montgomery's written word, then I suggest you skip this film, but if your someone with enough ""scope for the imagination,"" to be able to consider a alternative point of view. I think that you will enjoy this film and all of the throwbacks and shout-outs that it delivers.",4,FAR FAR better than the world lead me to believe!,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,3878,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'avoided', 'film', 'years', 'read', 'countless', 'reviews', 'saying', 'how', 'terrible', 'was', 'let', 'other', 'peoples', 'opinions', 'film', 'put', 'off', 'general', 'outline', 'story', 'seemed', 'very', 'unappealing', 'mean', 'Gilbert', 'dead', 'SERIOUSLY', 'liked', 'first', 'three', 'films', 'had', 'interest', 'film', 'Megan', 'Follows', 'Jonathan', 'Crombie', 'other', 'actors', 'knew', 'loved.Since', 'end', 'Road', 'Avonlea', 'Kevin', 'Sullivan', 'taken', 'very', 'strong', 'artistic', 'liberties', 'regards', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'entire', 'third', 'filmAnne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Continuing', 'Storywas', 'original', 'story', 'honestly', 'largely', 'enjoyed', 'others', 'found', 'be', 'complete', 'blasphemy', 'fact', 'matter', 'was', 'Montgomery', 'works', 'excellent', 'books', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'original', 'films', 'be', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'were', 'natural', 'direction', 'Sullivan', 'story', 'take.Well', 'FINALLY', 'purchased', 'film', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'remastered', 'box', 'setAnne', 'Green', 'Gables-Remastered', 'Complete', 'Colland', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'mad', 'had', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'sooner', 'found', 'largely', 'enjoyable', 'had', 'MANY', 'throw', 'backs', 'previous', 'films', 'honestly', 'thrilled', 'me.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'Anne', 'now', 'late', '50', 'involved', 'writing', 'play', 'be', 'performed', 'White', 'Sands', 'yes', 'apparently', 'put', 'plays', 'there', 'now', 'writing', 'play', 'back', 'Green', 'Gables', 'write', 'learn', 'couple', 'things', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'Anne', 'son', 'Dominic', 'Anne', '3', 'missing', 'action', 'beloved', 'Husband', 'Gilbert', 'died', 'THIS', 'WAS', 'MOST', 'DIFFICULT', 'PILL', 'TO', 'SWALLOW', 'AND', 'IS', 'MY', 'MAIN', 'REASON', 'FOR', 'GIVING', 'THIS', 'FILM', '4', 'STARS', 'INSTEAD', '5', 'WHY', 'POINTLESSLY', 'KILL', 'OFF', 'GILBERT', 'way', 'sorry', 'learn', 'Diana', 'family', 'been', 'staying', 'Green', 'Gables', 'last', '30', 'years', 'packing', 'move', 'out', 'Dina', 'daughter', 'Marilla', 'old', 'letters', 'letter', 'was', 'apparently', 'sent', 'Green', 'Gables', 'Anne', 'father', '.I', 'know', 'what', 'thinking', 'Anne', 'father', 'dead', 'Well', 'not', 'exactly', 'Sullivan', 'interpretation', 'score', 'bonus', 'points', 'getting', 'see', 'Colleen', 'Dewhurst', 'flashback', 'advance', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'Anne', 'early', 'years', 'green', 'gables', 'flashbacks', 'pull', 'first', 'novel', 'time', 'Thomas', 'largely', 'original', 'story', 'very', 'disturbing', 'sometimes', 'lighthearted', 'Anne', 'story', 'time', 'mother', 'death', 'up', 'beginning', 'first', 'film', 'when', 'dropped', 'live', ""Hammond's.The"", 'film', 'features', 'numerous', 'shout-outs', 'previous', 'films', 'other', 'gems', 'seeing', 'Diana', 'Anne', 'families', 'finally', 'see', 'RILLA', 'albeit', 'briefly', 'also', 'Hetty', 'King', 'Rachael', 'Lynde', 'are', '90', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'was', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'see', 'characters', 'back', 'film', 'must', 'tell', 'really', 'ultimately', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'mindset', 'OK', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'rest', 'so', 'just', 'knock', 'last', 'one', 'out', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'film', 'made', 'believer', 'know', 'not', 'completely', 'according', 'books', 'Sullivan', 'explanation', 'Anne', 'psyche', 'believable', 'very', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'little', 'girl', 'may', 'not', 'tell', 'truth', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'parents', 'especially', 'one', 'circumstances', 'Sullivan', 'film', 'said', 'Anne', 'purest', 'how', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deal', 'anything', 'Montgomery', 'written', 'word', 'then', 'suggest', 'skip', 'film', 'someone', 'enough', 'scope', 'imagination', 'be', 'able', 'consider', 'alternative', 'point', 'view', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'throwbacks', 'shout-outs']",Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning

1235770,A2JLK1SQ8O03EO,B001TD73OI,octobercountry,"[25, 25]","Toronto-based Sullivan Productions has made a livelihood from adaptations of Canadian author L. M. Montgomery's works for the past twenty-five years. Now, I think the production company has done fine work in the past; I absolutely loved Anne of Green Gables and the first sequel to that film, Anne of Avonlea. Likewise, I really enjoyed The Road to Avonlea, the television series that was set in Anne's world and which ran for seven seasons. However, in this latest film, Sullivan has gone to the well once too often.My first very apt reaction, while watching this film, was ""Who wrote this garbage?"" The answer is, none other than Kevin Sullivan himself, which I find puzzling. I don't see how he can have produced and directed such very fine adaptations of some of Maud Montgomery's novels, and then utterly trashed Maud's legacy with nonsense like this. The film totally re-writes Anne's entire back-story, present in both the earlier films and the original series of books. Hmmm, turns out that Anne was not an orphan after all before she came to Green Gables---she had an entirely different life and set of adventures, complete with uncaring absentee father.There's no point in my going on about the many things wrong with this film, I'm just so disgusted with it. Thing is, perhaps this could have been a decent story if they hadn't tried to shoehorn it into the Anne franchise. If this had been about a totally different girl, coming from a background of adversity, I may have dredged up some interest in the tale. But---not without a thorough re-write first. The plot had some major holes and never did play out in a satisfactory manner. The entire final quarter of the film only raised a whole host of questions; the inconsistency-ridden finale was most unsatisfying. None of it, in the end, made any sense.Now, the film is beautifully shot, and has a pleasant background score---but that was not nearly enough to overcome the negatives. Far as I'm concerned, Sullivan has spit on Montgomery's legacy---and not only that, he is guilty of writing a lousy script. I think that any fan of the Anne stories is probably going to want to watch this just out of curiosity, but I cannot recommend it in any way. I'm glad this was a rental and I didn't waste my money on buying a copy; if I had, I could not have in good conscience tried to re-sell it; I would have just tossed it in the bin.
