844841,AAJTZPX7HDE5U,B0002T7YWQ,Brian J Hay,"[29, 40]","This is no-nonsense journalism at its best. It sets the standard the profession should adhere to. At least it should be setting that standard. There's no integrity left in North American journalism so this ends up being shut out by people who'd rather avoid dealing with disturbing facts. Greg Palast is one of what's turning out to be a rare sort of breed these days. He does what almost everybody else assiduously avoids doing: he follows the trail left by the money.What he finds should affect the view people have of world politics and how things really work.His sights are set on the Bush family. He explores their ties to the corporate sector and the effect they've had on the events of the last four years. The revelations concerning the election of year 2000 and how it was stolen are shocking. I've followed his reports for a couple of years now and knew these things already. I still find them shocking. His exposure of the money trail behind it all leaves no doubt as to the criminal nature behind those events.The same thing holds true with his coverage of the Bush family's ties to Enron and Ken Lay. He lays out where the money came from, where it went, and what George gave to Enron. He never suggests bribery or influence peddling. He just points out who got what. The information ends up speaking for itself.Palast first revealed the documentation concerning the selling off of Iraqi assets over a year ago. Every concerned party should take careful note of this information. It goes further toward explaining why events are taking the shape as they have since he first brought it out than anything anyone else has said (or shown) does.These are just a few examples of the film's content and they reflect the pattern of this entire presentation. With each subject Palast tracks the money and shows where the trail leads. The dots connect themselves. His presentation of information is direct, effective and straight to the point. He's not lacking in wit either. The film is sprinkled with bits of dry humour and has one moment of genuine hilarity. It's clear the scene was set up intentionally. The man has a good sense of dramatic timing to go along with his journalistic skills.The interview (which follows the film) is exceptional. This is set up as a separate chapter and should be watched several times. Greg Palast isn't just a well-informed individual: he's an interesting one as well. His insight and overview of how events transpire is a rare and valuable one.The only complaint I have with this documentary is that it takes too long to get moving. The prologue is an assortment of clips from the film backed by a haunting track supplied by Moby (which is proof positive that Palast recognizes and respects genius). The various credits for the film are more or less ""filtered"" in. It's an effective method of presenting themes but it lasts too long.It's a small complaint though. Palast presents information that's invaluable and he substantiates all of it. There's enough here to warrant going back time and again. I know. I've been doing that. His method of presenting it is stylish, effective and always to the point. Anyone who watches and enjoys this film would do well to follow it up by obtaining a copy of his bestselling book, ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"". That will leave them wishing to see the more of the information Palast offers presented on film.The mainstream media lost much of its credibility when Iraq's infamous ""WMD's"" failed to materialize. They did it to themselves though. They didn't question what Bush and his cronies had to say even though statements they made kept falling flat on their faces. They're not cleaning their act up either. This, and other documentaries like it offer an alternative that's proving it can be a good one.Much of what's here has gotten into the mainstream. That's true. But it's only because Palast and others like him pushed it and kept pushing it before it was fashionable to do so. And it needs to keep coming up. If not it gets forgotten. Society can't afford that, not if we want to keep living in a functioning democracy. This film is an important one for anyone who values that process. The use of electronic voting machines has been been discussed here in Canada as well. Palast's findings demonstrate how these machines would be used.This is the film that should have been shown on the week of the election.

844845,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0002T7YWQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[86, 103]","Along with Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Bush's Brain"" about Bush advisor Karl Rove, this excellent one-hour DVD appears to complete an eye-opening trilogy of pertinent documentaries about concerns raised in continuing the Bush administration for another four years. Each has its shortcomings, mostly around the veracity of some of the findings, but this one by journalist Greg Palast seems more grounded than the other two and consequently less caught up in its own hyperbole. Perhaps that's because it was first produced for the BBC where a non-American audience was trying to make sense of Bush's rise to prominence, his imperialist and economically insensitive policies and the extremist feelings he seems to induce in this country.Much of this material has been covered in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", but his approach is quite different. Palast also does not focus as much on Iraq since his film was made earlier than Moore's. What he does cover is still quite intriguing, beginning with Bush's admittance into the Texas Air Guard, which effectively ensured he would not see active duty in Vietnam. Among those interviewed regarding that mysteriously unrecorded period are people who claim that Bush didn't even show up for duty. Palast even one-ups Moore by finding an official who swears that any incriminating evidence in Bush's file was shredded to avoid making the then-Governor of Texas look anything but heroic. The controversial 2000 Florida election results are covered in this film as well. Moore had powerful footage of African-American members of Congress being turned away for their pleas to invalidate the results. Palast, on the other hand, takes great care in providing some seriously damning evidence providing documents (included as part of the DVD extras) which prove that many legitimate voters were prevented from casting their ballots based on false accusations of a criminal past. The majority of these voters were not coincidentally African American and Democrat, and their numbers outdo the margin by which Bush defeated Gore by a fairly significant amount. A telling moment occurs when Palast tries to have a Florida official account for this alleged and obviously illegal act, and the man leaves the room in a huff and refuses to look at the documentation or answer his questions. Finally, like ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", much time is spent investigating Bush family ties with the Saudi royals and the bin Laden family. Palast traces the same money trail that Moore does connecting Bush's business endeavors back to Saudi investment money and bin Laden capital specifically.Chances are high that if you are a staunch Republican that you will avoid this DVD, which would be a shame since the evidence is powerfully presented here in a dry journalistic style. Having myself read ""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against Kerry"" to get an alternative perspective on John Kerry's leadership, I think it's fair to take a look at this film to see the other side. The DVD also includes a very enlightening interview with Palast on how he compiled his information.

Some of this is amusing--for example, when G.W. Bush denies knowing Ken Lay personally (of Enron Infamy), and yet nicknamed Ken Lay ""Kenny Boy"".

I particularly enjoyed watching Bush make the White House press conference statement about Enron: ""In the corporate world, sometimes things aren't exactly black and white."" Yes, well, the Bush Dynasty seem to have mined that lucrative grey area very, very well.Part of the documentary focuses on G.W, Bush's 'war record', and so some of this documentary wasn't new to me. G.W.'s glorious landing on the aircraft carrier, the Abraham Lincoln was also covered here--remember that was when G.W. made his now-famous 'end of major operations' speech about Iraq on May 2, 2003, and here we are in 1/05--more than 1,225 body bags later and still counting (and I can't include the numbers of Iraqi dead as the numbers just aren't there for some peculiar reason). We get more details about that photo op fiasco, and exactly what it took to get that perfect landing. I particularly enjoyed watching G.W. in his military togs, surrounded by military personnel, and in an uncandid moment, his eyes shifting as he tried to locate the camera.And lest we not forget, the other Bush siblings, Neil, Jeb and Marvin, are all mentioned here. It pays to have friends in high places. And there are other juicy tidbits. Palast argues that the invasion of Iraq was planned well before 9-11, and there's an interview with General Jay Garner who claims he was fired after calling for immediate elections in Iraq and replaced with Paul Bremmer. Then there's footage of Bush announcing Operation Iraqi Liberation (O.I.L). Interesting acronym ...The documentary is only 60 minutes long--it's a distillation of a longer BBC series, and also based on Palast's book. Unfortunately, as Greg Palast explains in the 10 minute extra interview at the end of the film, he cannot ""get through the electronic Berlin wall"" and is unable to get material on US television, so he resorts to ""swimming across the Atlantic"" to report stories--displacedhuman",4,Follow the trail of money by the stench.,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",2005,3098,"['watched', 'documentary', 'Bush', 'Family', 'Fortunes', 'one', 'phrase', 'kept', 'coming', 'head', ""'Conflict"", 'Interest', 'power', 'should', ""n't"", 'profit', 'directly', 'indirectly', 'political', 'policies', 'enact', 'so', 'should', 'be', 'raised', 'let', 'alone', 'jail', 'sentences', 'given', 'stinky', 'deals', 'film', 'uncovers', 'must', 'be', 'naive', 'find', 'entire', 'Enron/Bush', 'Saudi/Bush', 'Bin', 'Laden/Bush', 'Carlyle/Bush', 'Harken/Bush', 'Silverado/Bush', 'connections', 'could', 'continue', 'ad', 'nauseam', 'here', 'putrid.Investigative', 'reporter', 'Greg', 'Palast', 'money', 'trail', 'pockets', 'Saudi', 'Billionaires', 'Oil', 'Billionaires', 'Billionaire', 'contractors', 'ever', 'dedicated', 'lobbyists', 'deep', 'pockets', 'Bush', 'campaign', 'fund', 'then', 'back', 'little', 'gifts', 'favours', 'awards', 'meted', 'out', 'various', 'Bush', 'administrations', 'stand', 'deliver', 'loyal', 'Bush', 'buds', 'amusing', 'example', 'when', 'G.W', 'Bush', 'knowing', 'Ken', 'Lay', 'personally', 'Enron', 'Infamy', 'yet', 'nicknamed', 'Ken', 'Lay', 'Kenny', 'Boy', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'amusing', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'nauseating', 'Palast', 'dynasty', 'money', 'office', 'office', 'more', 'money', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Bush', 'make', 'White', 'House', 'press', 'conference', 'statement', 'Enron', 'corporate', 'world', 'sometimes', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'black', 'white', 'Yes', 'well', 'Bush', 'Dynasty', 'seem', 'have', 'mined', 'lucrative', 'grey', 'area', 'very', 'very', 'well.Part', 'documentary', 'focuses', 'G.W', 'Bush', ""'war"", 'record', 'so', 'documentary', 'was', ""n't"", 'new', 'G.W', 'glorious', 'landing', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'also', 'covered', 'here', 'remember', 'was', 'when', 'G.W', 'made', 'now-famous', ""'end"", 'major', 'operations', 'speech', 'Iraq', 'May', '2', '2003', 'here', 'are', '1/05', 'more', '1,225', 'body', 'bags', 'later', 'still', 'counting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'numbers', 'Iraqi', 'dead', 'numbers', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'peculiar', 'reason', 'get', 'more', 'details', 'photo', 'op', 'fiasco', 'exactly', 'what', 'took', 'get', 'perfect', 'landing', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'G.W', 'military', 'togs', 'surrounded', 'military', 'personnel', 'uncandid', 'moment', 'eyes', 'shifting', 'tried', 'locate', 'camera.And', 'lest', 'not', 'forget', 'other', 'Bush', 'siblings', 'Neil', 'Jeb', 'Marvin', 'are', 'mentioned', 'here', 'have', 'friends', 'high', 'places', 'are', 'other', 'juicy', 'tidbits', 'Palast', 'invasion', 'Iraq', 'was', 'planned', 'well', '9-11', 'interview', 'General', 'Jay', 'Garner', 'who', 'was', 'fired', 'calling', 'immediate', 'elections', 'Iraq', 'replaced', 'Paul', 'Bremmer', 'Then', 'footage', 'Bush', 'announcing', 'Operation', 'Iraqi', 'Liberation', 'O.I.L', 'Interesting', 'acronym', 'documentary', 'only', '60', 'minutes', 'long', 'distillation', 'longer', 'BBC', 'series', 'also', 'based', 'Palast', 'book', 'Unfortunately', 'Greg', 'Palast', '10', 'minute', 'extra', 'interview', 'end', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'electronic', 'Berlin', 'wall', 'unable', 'get', 'material', 'US', 'television', 'swimming', 'Atlantic', 'report', 'stories', 'displacedhuman']",N/A

Wouldn't I feel awful if I helped put this cretin back in office to wreak biblical havoc upon the world?Bush Family Fortunes - The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, rehashes much of the information disseminated in Fahrenheit 9/11 but it is dispersed using a different methodology. In BFFTHDMCB the film takes on more of an investigative news report feeling ie. Dateline or 60 Minutes. In Fact, the movie starts out with an indignant Assistant Florida Secretary of State walking out on Palast, stating the interview is over.The overriding premise of the movie is that G. W. Bush's presidency calculates every move to increase his stature an make money for his friends and his family. Included as some of the beneficiaries of the president's largesse are bankrupt Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay, Vice President Cheney's former company Haliburton of which Cheney was CEO, Arms manufacturer, The Carlyle Group, the bin Ladens and the Saudi Royal Family.Palast also lays out a convincing case of what many have suspected. The real reason for the invasion of Iraq was OIL and shows a map supposedly surreptitiously obtained which shows the oil fields and allegedly depicts the areas various oil companies were to operate in.Palast also delves into the Bush war record which has many unanswered questions. Ostensibly Bush leapfrogged over some one hundred thousand other applicants on the waiting list and tested 25 of 100 on the National Guard entrance test (after graduating from Yale), the lowest score allowed. In addition when Bush was Governor, he had staff members go through and shred many of his Air National Guard records.CONCLUSIONFor those that have seen Farhenheit 9/11, you may want to pass on BFFTHDMCB as it covers much of the same material, all of which is unfavorable to the Bush administration, unless, of course, you cannot get enough bad news about our president. However, much of the Florida election shenanigans that have been uncovered and continue to be uncovered that were shown in both films were the work of Greg Palast. Palast says the orchestrated problems that were evident in 2000 have not been corrected and that there is a potential for even more mischief.One thing I heard that did not ring true and I don't believe, is when Greg was interviewing a big time lawyer, who had been involved in the big tobacco settlement and was now investigating 9/11, said in no uncertain terms that our intelligence agencies have known since 1995 that terrorists planned to crash an airplane into either a symbol of commerce or the military. If there was any truth to this than it would have been in the 9/11 Commission Report and it wasn't. When you see something like this that you feel is inaccurate you start to wonder if other things mentioned and not corroborated elsewhere are also inaccurate. This is a weakness in the film for me. Luckily that for me was the only thing that stood out as being unlikely.This movie and the proceeding book were based upon Palast's hard hitting investigative reports for BBC and UK's Guardian and Observer newspapers.

While Michael moore proudly where a Michigan State University cap, palast dons a fedora.Indeed, BUSH FAMILY FORTUNES elaborates on a number of arguements commonly made against George W. Bush. For example, did he ever serve his coutry during the Vietnam War? Well, that's what cradle-to-grave conservative Republican politicians and voters would have you bleieve.But not according to the assisstant to George Texas Air Guard General (the General is deceased), who states unequvically, on camera, that while Bush was Governor of Texas, his underlings called in and order any shred of evidence that Bush went AWOL to be removed from his military records and be, well, shredded!!!And what about the 2000 election. Palast takes this even further than did Moore, with his discovery the some 94,000 Florida voters, mostly blacks, were forbidden to vote because they were listed as felons. Were they? Well, Palast discovers that the list of felons forbidden to vote in Florida in 2000 was 95% inaccuarate, and that these people who were barred from voting would more than likely have swung Florida, and thus the Presidency, for Al Gore. This is due to the fact that Bush campaign manager Katherine Harris, conviently also the woman in charge of the Florida vote count paid DBT ChoicePoint $4 million to come up with a list of names of felons, who should not be allowed to vote, and then telling ChoicePoint not to bother verifiying the accuracy of the list, thus barring Floridians voters (the majority, Palast asserts, Democrats) from voting because their names are similar to convicted felons anywhere in the U.S.And finally we come, as all Anti-Bush documentaries must, to the War in Iraq, and Palast essentially proves without a shadow of a doubt that indeed, it WAS for oil.Aside from Bush going on live television and forbidding Iraqis from desroying oil wells, Palast also uncovers a confedential White House document, ""written long before the war started"" the lays out plans the divide and privitize all of Iraq's assets, ""especially those in oil.""And if that doesn't convince you, than how about the evidence that Cheney prepared for the Iraq war by studying maps of Iraq with Oil company CEO's. This has recntly gotten more media attention in the face of oil companies making record profits in the wake of the recnt takeoff in gas prices. This, I imagine, is going to provide a massive blow to the Bush Administration's already sagging Public Approval ratings.If you let the liars and conservative Bush supporters trick you into beliving that Michael Moore's FAHRENHEIT 9/11 is full of lies (Moore critic and unapologetic liar Dave Kopel, in the film FAHRENHYPE 9/11, calls the allegetion that we invaded Iraq for oil ""Preposterous""), then let Mr. Palast be your guide.",5,Michael Moore's dorm buddy,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,3281,"['Yes', 'hardly', 'anrguement', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'Greg', 'Palast', 'dual', 'roles', 'film', 'asserting', 'corruption', 'greedy', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'confriming', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'indeed', 'NOT', 'liar', 'Moore', 'actually', 'given', 'VERY', 'SPECIAL', 'THANKS', 'end', 'credits', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'known', 'populist', 'rabble-rouser', 'course', 'reviled', 'conservatives', 'everwhere', 'Lying', 'Propagandist', 'Palast', 'more', 'resourceful', 'gumshoe', 'Michael', 'moore', 'proudly', 'where', 'Michigan', 'State', 'University', 'cap', 'palast', 'dons', 'fedora.Indeed', 'BUSH', 'FAMILY', 'FORTUNES', 'number', 'arguements', 'commonly', 'made', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'example', 'did', 'ever', 'serve', 'coutry', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Well', 'what', 'cradle-to-grave', 'conservative', 'Republican', 'politicians', 'voters', 'would', 'have', 'not', 'according', 'assisstant', 'George', 'Texas', 'Air', 'Guard', 'General', 'General', 'deceased', 'who', 'unequvically', 'camera', 'Bush', 'was', 'Governor', 'Texas', 'underlings', 'called', 'order', 'shred', 'evidence', 'Bush', 'went', 'AWOL', 'be', 'removed', 'military', 'records', 'be', 'well', 'shredded', 'what', '2000', 'election', 'Palast', 'even', 'further', 'did', 'Moore', 'discovery', '94,000', 'Florida', 'voters', 'mostly', 'blacks', 'were', 'forbidden', 'vote', 'were', 'listed', 'felons', 'Were', 'Well', 'Palast', 'list', 'felons', 'forbidden', 'vote', 'Florida', '2000', 'was', '95', '%', 'inaccuarate', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'barred', 'voting', 'would', 'more', 'likely', 'have', 'swung', 'Florida', 'thus', 'Presidency', 'Al', 'Gore', 'due', 'fact', 'Bush', 'campaign', 'manager', 'Katherine', 'Harris', 'conviently', 'also', 'woman', 'charge', 'Florida', 'vote', 'count', 'paid', 'DBT', 'ChoicePoint', '4', 'million', 'come', 'up', 'list', 'names', 'felons', 'who', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'vote', 'then', 'telling', 'ChoicePoint', 'not', 'bother', 'verifiying', 'accuracy', 'list', 'thus', 'barring', 'Floridians', 'voters', 'majority', 'Palast', 'Democrats', 'voting', 'names', 'are', 'similar', 'convicted', 'felons', 'anywhere', 'U.S.And', 'finally', 'come', 'Anti-Bush', 'documentaries', 'must', 'War', 'Iraq', 'Palast', 'essentially', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'indeed', 'WAS', 'oil.Aside', 'Bush', 'going', 'live', 'television', 'forbidding', 'Iraqis', 'desroying', 'oil', 'wells', 'Palast', 'also', 'confedential', 'White', 'House', 'document', 'written', 'long', 'war', 'started', 'lays', 'out', 'divide', 'privitize', 'Iraq', 'assets', 'especially', 'oil', ""n't"", 'convince', 'how', 'evidence', 'Cheney', 'prepared', 'Iraq', 'war', 'studying', 'maps', 'Iraq', 'Oil', 'company', 'CEO', 'recntly', 'gotten', 'more', 'media', 'attention', 'face', 'oil', 'companies', 'making', 'record', 'profits', 'wake', 'recnt', 'takeoff', 'gas', 'prices', 'imagine', 'going', 'provide', 'massive', 'blow', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'already', 'sagging', 'Public', 'Approval', 'ratings.If', 'let', 'liars', 'conservative', 'Bush', 'supporters', 'trick', 'beliving', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'full', 'lies', 'Moore', 'critic', 'unapologetic', 'liar', 'Dave', 'Kopel', 'film', 'FAHRENHYPE', '9/11', 'allegetion', 'invaded', 'Iraq', 'oil', 'Preposterous', 'then', 'let', 'Mr.', 'Palast', 'be', 'guide']",N/A

The title certainly suggests this.  I was a little disappointed with the film, perhaps the book is better.  It just seemed a little too partisan for me, always showing clips of our President and others that were not complimentary, but of course that is the aim of this film to show the darker side of the Bush regime.  I felt too much attention was paid to the 2000 election ballot dispute and in an inflammatory way that would disgust African Americans showing that their votes were just thrown away in Palm Beach, Fla.  Not that I'm not sympathetic, and especially if that is true, it just seems to me that the African American vote is so important in this country, yet people, the media, journalists, politicians etc. will say or do anything to get that voting block and use African Americans as pawns in their game.  I've been concerned myself about the corrupting influence of oil money upon our government, that given economic realities, one might be swayed to not do what is right, to make unwise alliances.  At the same time though, Greg Palast's research is thorough and backed by the BBC.  The thing that really made alarm bells go off in my mind was the suggestion that, given all of the evidence, Americans should take to the streets and march in protest.  Who really wants to repeat what went on in the very turbulent, violent, and murderous 60's?  As bad as Bush and co. may seem to be from this evidence, I'm convinced from my experience as a southern, caucasian woman that Bush's gang is not the only problem in this good country of ours.  Rallying a mob is unwise; educating one as this film tries to do is much wiser.  So I have mixed feelings for this film, yet recommend it to all those who see George W.

844863,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B0002T7YWQ,William Hare,"[110, 130]","Greg Palast during the personal interview phase of his hard hitting new DVD documentary ""Bush Family Fortunes"", which he adapted from his penetrating bestseller ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"", explains what it took to enable him to provide his insightful commentaries into the current political scene.  He had to move out of the country.Many people think that Greg Palast is a British reporter.  Actually he hails originally from the San Fernando Valley suburban Southern California town of Van Nuys, but in the process of attempting to penetrate through the thick veneer of corporate media concentration, he was stymied.  Since the British Broadcasting Corporation was willing to present his television reporting and The Guardian willing to publish his articles, Palast has been spending a great deal of his time in London.  ""My kids have these funny Upstairs, Downstairs English accents,"" he explains, ""and I'd love to spend more time in America, but I found I had to work in England.""Michael Moore calls Palast's reporting ""courageous"" and it certainly is.  He never takes a backward step, especially when it comes to the rich and powerful that are attempting to shield their unscrupulous practices.  This film reveals how George W. Bush went AWOL in the Texas Air National Guard when it appeared that combat might be awaiting in Vietnam.A fellow Guardsman explains that the rules were bent in order for him to be accepted, since the general rule was that members had between three and years of flying experience to be considered.  Bush not only had no such experience; he was just one point above the ""too dumb to fly"" minimum score on his entrance application and had over 100,000 applicants ahead of him.  He also, it must be noted, had a father who was a famous Houston congressman.Palast recounts how Bush failed in four tries in the oil business, how his father was set up with a million dollar account by his father, Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, in what friendly corporate media sources have described as ""making it on his own"" as an oilman in Midland Texas, as well as how young Bush, through his connections, received a lucrative contract from Bahrain for oil drilling despite the fact that his Harken Energy was a fledgling young company without the kind of track record expected under the circumstances.  As Palast's documentary repeatedly reveals, it helps when you have the name of Bush and the myriad connections flowing therefrom.Another important aspect of the documentary is the informative revelations about Bush family involvement with the Saudi oil monarchy and the Carlyle Group.  He follows the Saudi connection attentively, noting how the Bush family used the FBI to spike an investigation into the bin Laden family, with which the Bushes were closely linked.The most hilarious episode in this fast-moving documentary involves the climax of Palast's investigation into charges that Governor Jeb Bush used his influence along with Katherine Harris to suppress votes of close to one hundred thousand African-Americans in the 2000 presidential election on his brother's behalf.  Palast tragically was unable to generate interest from American sources in this story when it was developing during the post-election recount period.  He notes that even the Gore team was afraid to jump aboard and provide support.As a result Palast used his London BBC connection and flew to Florida's capital of Tallahassee to conduct interviews.  When he began filming an interview with Clay Roberts, Harris's top subordinate and the state's supervisor of elections, the interviewee nervously ended the process.  This came just as Palast was beginning to ask Roberts about the firm used by the state to track down alleged ""felons.""Roberts ended the interview, scurried into his office, and called security, looking like both a frightened and petulant child.  A nonchalant Florida state trooper entrusted with evicting Palast from the premises grinned and told the interviewer, ""There's never a dull moment around here.""  Meanwhile a highly nervous Roberts called out from his office in the adjoining room that Palast must leave immediately.  Such is Republican democracy as practiced by the brothers Bush, Katherine Harris, and Clay Roberts.The informative DVD also contains interactive material consisting of ""secret"" contracts and memos from closed-door meetings.  The film demonstrates the ongoing clash between vigilant reporters fearlessly seeking the truth and corrupt corporate and political forces equally determined to prevent it from surfacing.",5,Palast Outlines The Political Rise of George W.

844864,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,B0002T7YWQ,"William Van Hefner ""William Van Hefner""","[6, 8]","I rented this documentary on DVD last week, and have to admit that it was a bit of a let-down. Despite all of the comments made here about how none of this could have aired on American TV, because the press is somehow censoring it, there wasn't much of anything new in this documentary that I haven't read about or seen on TV before.I'm definitely no Bush apologist. I would have enjoyed seeing more dirt having been dug up, but most of it just seemed like old news to me. I will say that the presentation and background research seemed to be spot on, otherwise I would not give the video three stars. It definitely lacked the sort of breakthrough evidence that one normally expects from a film selling itself as an expose though.The most original content contained in the movie is a series of interviews done with those having some sort of connection with former President Bush, although there were a few interviewees that seemingly had no connection with Bush at all. These interviews seemed to mostly imply that the entire political system in the United States (especially Texas) is corrupt, not just the politics of the Bush family. These ended up seeming more like a distraction than being supporting evidence.I think that the film's biggest flaw is the fact that it spends so much time hopping from one allegation to the next, without having time to delve too deeply into any one of them. I believe that the limitation of trying to cram the contents of his entire book into such a short film led to so much editing that the entire thing seems like a blur at times. It definitely had some good moments and provides an excellent, overall synopsis of some of the many allegations against the Bush family, but it still feels rather incomplete in the end.
