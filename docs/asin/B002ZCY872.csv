1299932,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B002ZCY872,Brandon J. Smith,"[0, 0]","**Spoilers Ahead: This review applies to both the 1.0 and 1.5 sets.**I find myself a fan of many shows that spawned short-lived, failed spin-offs. Bablyon 5 had Crusade. The Star Trek franchise had the miserable Enterprise series. Stargate sadly came to a halt with Stargate Universe. And Battlestar Galactica had Caprica.Caprica could have been great. Instead, it's one of the best shows that never truly was. The question then becomes, is it worth watching? As a huge fan of Battlestar Galactica, my answer is: I think so.For the first time, rewatching a show did not change my opinion in any way from my original opinion of the show when it was airing. The only difference of note was how I recognized more actors from other shows I've caught up on, especially all the ones who had been on one of the Stargates and other Syfy shows. My feeling, then and now, is that this show had a ton of potential but failed to capitalize on it. Caprica should have run for a good four seasons, and, given the closing sequence, I have little doubt that the show would have found its stride in the second season, but instead we only got the one.It's appropriate that the single season is broken into two halves, as the second half marks a definite shift in tone. The action picks up in season 1.5 after the relentless moroseness of season 1.0.Caprica had one of the best pilot episodes I can recall. For some, this pilot movie could be the only &#34;required viewing&#34; for fans of BSG. The acting ranges from good to outstanding, and the special effects are mostly done very well and unobtrusively, especially the cylons.There are weakness, though.For me, V-World never quite worked, with &#34;New Cap City&#34; a bore. Taamra Adams never quite worked. Too much time was spent with the police investigation and the various terrorists (though Polly Walker is wonderful as Clarice and Magda Apanowicz was very good as Lacy Rand), which hurt the momentum building up for the really interesting characters, particularly Daniel and Zoe Greystone.Joseph Adams/Adama was handled inconsistently between the two halves: at first, he seems a bit spineless, but later episodes revealed him to have killed in his youth and to have had an affair while his wife was still alive. Not knowing what to do with him, Sam quickly became the more compelling of the brothers to watch.Amanda Greystone was another character that lacked focus and who, quite frankly, I found rather irritating. The plotline involving her history of insanity was poorly done. Such a central role in the series, I think her characterization was mishandled.On the good side, Eric Stolz and Alessandra Torresani were tremendous. They command the screen whenever they're in a scene, and the scenes they share are positively electric. If Caprica had narrowed its focus to stay with them more (and on the killer robots!) we would have had a better series, one that may have found more of an audience. They should have been put together more and sooner, rather than dragging out the chase for the whole season.The picture and audio on the set is top quality, but one thing I don't like is how every episode begins with a recap. I'd prefer if those recaps were optional. If watching a number of episodes in a row, as I'll tend to do with DVD sets, the recap is unnecessary and just gets in the way of the viewing experience.Overall, I'm glad I added this series to my collection. I do think it supports rather than diminishes the legacy of Battlestar Galactica. I leave with a sense of what could have been and feel some disappointment, but I find it worth seeing.",4,What Might Have Been,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,3605,"['**Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'review', 'both', '1.0', '1.5', 'sets', '**I', 'find', 'fan', 'many', 'shows', 'spawned', 'short-lived', 'failed', 'spin-offs', 'Bablyon', '5', 'had', 'Crusade', 'Star', 'Trek', 'franchise', 'had', 'miserable', 'Enterprise', 'series', 'Stargate', 'sadly', 'came', 'halt', 'Stargate', 'Universe', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'had', 'Caprica.Caprica', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'Instead', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'never', 'truly', 'was', 'question', 'then', 'watching', 'huge', 'fan', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'answer', 'think', 'first', 'time', 'rewatching', 'show', 'did', 'not', 'change', 'opinion', 'way', 'original', 'opinion', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'airing', 'only', 'difference', 'note', 'was', 'how', 'recognized', 'more', 'actors', 'other', 'shows', ""'ve"", 'caught', 'up', 'especially', 'ones', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'Stargates', 'other', 'Syfy', 'shows', 'My', 'feeling', 'then', 'now', 'show', 'had', 'ton', 'potential', 'failed', 'capitalize', 'Caprica', 'should', 'have', 'run', 'good', 'four', 'seasons', 'given', 'closing', 'sequence', 'have', 'little', 'doubt', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'stride', 'second', 'season', 'instead', 'only', 'got', 'one.It', 'appropriate', 'single', 'season', 'broken', 'two', 'halves', 'second', 'half', 'definite', 'shift', 'tone', 'action', 'up', 'season', '1.5', 'relentless', 'moroseness', 'season', '1.0.Caprica', 'had', 'one', 'best', 'pilot', 'can', 'recall', 'pilot', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'only', '34', 'required', 'viewing', '34', 'fans', 'BSG', 'acting', 'ranges', 'good', 'outstanding', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'mostly', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'unobtrusively', 'especially', 'cylons.There', 'are', 'weakness', 'though.For', 'V-World', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', '34', 'New', 'Cap', 'City', '34', 'bore', 'Taamra', 'Adams', 'never', 'quite', 'worked', 'Too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'police', 'investigation', 'various', 'terrorists', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'wonderful', 'Clarice', 'Magda', 'Apanowicz', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'Lacy', 'Rand', 'hurt', 'momentum', 'building', 'up', 'really', 'interesting', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Daniel', 'Zoe', 'Greystone.Joseph', 'Adams/Adama', 'was', 'handled', 'inconsistently', 'two', 'halves', 'first', 'bit', 'spineless', 'later', 'episodes', 'revealed', 'have', 'killed', 'youth', 'have', 'had', 'affair', 'wife', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'Not', 'knowing', 'what', 'do', 'Sam', 'quickly', 'became', 'more', 'compelling', 'brothers', 'watch.Amanda', 'Greystone', 'was', 'character', 'lacked', 'focus', 'who', 'quite', 'frankly', 'found', 'rather', 'irritating', 'plotline', 'involving', 'history', 'insanity', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'central', 'role', 'series', 'think', 'characterization', 'was', 'mishandled.On', 'good', 'side', 'Eric', 'Stolz', 'Alessandra', 'Torresani', 'were', 'tremendous', 'command', 'screen', 'whenever', ""'re"", 'scene', 'scenes', 'share', 'are', 'positively', 'electric', 'Caprica', 'had', 'narrowed', 'focus', 'stay', 'more', 'killer', 'robots', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'series', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'more', 'audience', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'more', 'sooner', 'rather', 'dragging', 'out', 'chase', 'whole', 'season.The', 'picture', 'audio', 'set', 'top', 'quality', 'one', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'how', 'episode', 'recap', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'recaps', 'were', 'optional', 'watching', 'number', 'episodes', 'row', ""'ll"", 'tend', 'do', 'DVD', 'sets', 'recap', 'unnecessary', 'just', 'way', 'viewing', 'experience.Overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'added', 'series', 'collection', 'do', 'think', 'rather', 'diminishes', 'legacy', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'leave', 'sense', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'feel', 'disappointment', 'find', 'worth', 'seeing']",Caprica: Season 1.0

Now in BSG Brother Cabal or whatever his name is thounsands of years old along with all of the ""Final Five."" when the 13th Colony(Earth) Fell in their war, Cabal sent the Final Five to the 12 Colonies with no memories of their past. So while i was watching Caprica i was expecting to see some sort of influence from Brother Cabal instigating/influencing the original Cylon war. Or maybe they havent gotten that far yet. My point is in BSG the human Cylon (Cabal) is overall Villian in the story and the reason the Cylons Hate the humans so much. I just dont see how Zoe's Story, while interesting, makes any sense to the overall story.

What will happen on Caprica when Graystone Company completes their contract with the government of Caprica for the production of 100,000 Cylon's as a military force?As slowly as this series seems to move, violent pressure is building at a steady rate, and circumstances are forming which in a seeming intersection of synchronicitywill come together, certainly by the end of the season in a figurative and literal explosion that Caprica, Daniel Graystone, Willie Adama, or Joseph Adama could or do not have the slightest hint.In Zoe Graystone and Tamara Adama, two young women who grew up with the Holoband, there are two young girls really who seem somehow, perhaps unconsciously, to know that something revolutionary and catastrophically violent is soon to happen. Certainly not in the next episode, nor the one after, but certainly by the end of the season Caprica, and then the other 11 colonies will be rocked by what is the beginning of ""the Fall"" 58 years I think it is, in the future.Zoe Graystone, characterized by Daniel Graystone as being a Cylon who scores on intelligence tests as genius, is the prototype of the Cylon race and quite possibly to become the Cylon leader among the 100,000, while Tamara Adama rules the virtual Caprica City. The possibilities make my head spin.Will I be able to sleep tonight?

Each of whom were captivating for every moment they were on the screen.Altogether this was an amazing episode of what was a thoughtful, challenging, and enchantingly convoluted series.

1299966,A354H94JN81SHW,B002ZCY872,"Gruntled ""Gruntled""","[0, 0]","Syfy's series Caprica, a spin-off and prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, is an impressive look at the beginnings of the Cylon War, starting with the creation of the first Cylon.  Taking place some sixty years before the events of BSG, this saga follows the lives of two families, the wealthy industrialist Greystones, and the middle-class attorney Adamas.(Incidentally, I dislike spoilers, so please forgive me for excluding plot details.  Believe me, you'll appreciate it when you watch the show.)One thing that I don't like is attempts to retcon, or give retroactive continuity, to an established show, that is, to change history in what came before.  Caprica is separated enough in time from BSG that any minor lapses in continuity could simply come from the presence of imperfect human memory, or from assumptions which are not correct.  The progression from the origins of the Cylons and the culture that gave rise to them, to the near destruction of humanity that drives BSG, is natural and organic.Caprica has a very different feel from BSG, and rightly so.  The story is of two families torn apart by a terrorist act, and brought together in their grief.  The additional cultural texture in the Adama clan's Tauron roots feel neither gratuitous or forced, instead adding depth to the family.  The son's name is William Adama, the same as the future captain of Battlestar Galactica, which connects the shows.Tackling questions of virtual reality, robotics, a golden age culture just hitting the tipping point towards decadence, and the nature of what makes human beings human, Caprica is a gripping drama, and gripping science fiction, with an emphasis on the science.

It's a fairly complex two-family drama that manages to interweave questions about consciousness, religion, technology and morality in a fairly unique way. It benefits from having a generally strong cast and high production standards given the budget. The Caprica universe is also well thought out and believable.There's a saggy middle section to the season which is probably the reason the ratings fell - if you can get through these 2-3 slower episodes, the last 4-5 shows deliver some clever plot twists and surprises. The final show crams in all the things the writers wished they could do if they'd been given another chance. Caprica had much potential once it had found its feet but TV networks seem to be killing science fictions shows rapidly at the moment.In total, I loved the blend of technology and religion and the New Cap City concept - it's raised plenty of taking points for me.

1299973,A1FEITLECMZ6EW,B002ZCY872,Jeffrey Thomas,"[0, 0]","Having seen Battlestar Galactica all the way through before watching this series I can say it was pretty good.All in all you really had to just keep watching the episodes and follow the story.Caprica is, simply put, a back-story on Battlestar Galactiga. It's a great series, no doubt, but you have to keep the fact that it is a back-story in mind when watching this series as I've heard people not understanding what the main points are and such.It's really all a matter of admiring the timeline and story.I'm not really sure when this series came out but I have to admit it would be interesting to see a season 2 to connect things.In case anyone's wondering if the historical timeline of this series with Battlestar Galactica is in sync, it looks pretty close to it.Spoilers added here:Whilst I'm surprised Clarice is still alive at the end of this episode, I found it a good connection of how Cylons began to believe in what they did.Really, what makes a great series great sometimes to me, like this series, is when you can ask questions about it and just allow yourself to know it's part of the story and you just sit back and admire the fact that you can ask all these little questions about the historical timeline. This story is great because it's interesting, it keeps you involved. It's very well done and actually like real life in events unfolding like they do here.All in all the series came off as realistic and very well done.Zoe's finale was interesting, I must say, and a season 2 would probably clear up a few things concerning the end, but I must say it did go well. However, her part at the end sitting in front of Clarice was weird, as it really did leave me wondering what was going on.For anyone who thinks having a ""skin-job"" in this time is out of sync with the timeline I think you're probably wrong. Unless someone made a season 2 and it became public knowledge that Zoe was a Cylon then no one besides those who knew Zoe was a Cylon would figure it out, probably. Thus, the future ""skin-jobs"" would possibly be made off the idea of Zoe.All in all, it does make a lot of sense when I think about it.To sum up, this series went very well. This was a very thought out and great series.Whilst I wonder if the series will start up again anytime soon and a season 2 happen is unknown. However, I'm happy I got to watch this series.Anyone who hasn't got to see this back-story it's good to learn a bit. However, I recommend watching it all the way through as I know you may pause and wonder if this is really great or not. Once you get close enough to the end you'll probably want to finish it and understand better.I'll admit this series is a little confusing, however, it's really good and worth the time to go through.Spoiler:Also, even though Will Adama died, that isn't the Adama who fathers Lee Adama and the other son. If you watch the end of this last episode you'll see Bill Adama who we all know well from Battlestar Galactica.Alright, well, I enjoyed the series, I hope those who watch do to.Edit: Found out about season 2. It was apparently cancelled, so no season 2 of Caprica.

I finished all four seasons of the newly, re-imagined BSG just a couple of weeks ago and wanted more, so I decided to check out ""Caprica"" and have to say I was very disappointed. Not so much at how the story doesn't really fit the backstory provided by BSG, as I understand the idea of creating a new story, but mostly because I couldn't stand the main characters so much. Zoey Graystone was whiney and annoying, I couldn't sympathize with her at all. I would have slapped her around too. And her parents were not any better. The only storyline I really loved was the Adama one. Their rich history should have been the center of the show, not the Graystone's storyline.I was also very annoyed with the use of religion. I liked how it was done on BSG better. It was very present, but not annoying. I understand the use of it was to perhaps set-up the reason why the Cylons worship one god and how that is important in the BSG universe, but I really don't think they went about it the right way on ""Caprica."" That added to my inability to sympathize with anyone but the Adamas who mostly stayed out of religion and stuck to family and their own national issues.In the end, I am hoping that this sort of prequel can be given another chance. I think there could be something amazing to work with, but the main character, the Zoey sort of character, needs to be a likeable character. Even if she's an evil character you love to hate.

Guess what? It's actually pretty good. Now, here in this first of two DVD sets of yet another decent show cut off in its prime, we have the slow beginnings of the ""Caprica"" storyline. Over half a century before ""BsG"" redux, this earthbound (ie, Caprica-bound) story weaves together the tale of two families, two cultures, two classes (?). The rich and affluent Greystones of Caprica. The Tauronese Adam(a)s. After meeting only a few times in the first few episodes (in the aftermath of losing daughters in a terrorist train bombing), the repercussions of the respective fathers' first plans and plots resonate onward, forever altering their lives and eventually sealing the fate of ""humanity."" (ie, not our humanity, since this is, like ""Star Wars,"" long ago and far away) Sounds nice and epic, right?But, this is smaller, domestic, more intimate, much more drama-centered and character-oriented. In other words, like ""Battlestar Galactica"" Redux, but without the military hardware and space battles to distract. It's a soap opera, to be sure, but with lots more substance than the vast majority of modern TV dramas.However, it's a very very slow burn. It's to be expected of any TV show-- the first season tends to be about finding and establishing its footing, its voice, its identity, and even the best shows took anywhere from several episodes to an entire first season (or even two) to establish its unique identity and qualities. Therefore, most of the episodes here have that shaky quality -- randomly and nervously ripping off a variety of earlier SF efforts on similar topics, establishing characters and their arcs (some more successfully than others), and starting before suddenly dropping various subplots and characters.I hate to do it, but if I had to pick on the one character that makes early ""Caprica"" such a pain to watch, it's Amanda Graystone. While she seems a decent enough wife to Daniel, she gets off to a bad start, being introduced as a total bitch to her daughter -- and you get the sense that it isn't really only just another bad day between them, either. After Zoe dies, Amanda is transformed into a total basket case: insecure, painfully gullible, hopelessly stupid (""Look at me wave around a pendant of the terrorist symbol I just now received in front of millions while confessing ""I think my daughter may have been a terrorist!""; yeah, that'll work). Yes, I know, it's the whole flawed character principle, but oh my god. And it doesn't help when we learn of her past psychiatric troubles and this weird and literally dead-end subplot about her dead brother that just disappears within a few episodes of starting, as if the writers themselves were embarrassed by it or didn't know what to do with it. She DOES get somewhat better and slightly redeemed, but only in the episodes of the next set.She's not the only one on stupid pills: For a while, Joseph Adama goes through a rather silly ""vr gaming is bad for you"" after-school special subplot that goes on too long. Everyone else is flawed, too, but in much more complex and compelling ways.And it all comes to a quite lovely and literally smashing mid-season finale that is satisfying and promises some great improvement to the show.And there it is: politics, religion, technology, corporate ethics, mafia morality, grieving, terrorism, family, relationships, duty, reality, ethics, the media -- all of these and more are engagingly explored, despite any hiccups and the initially slow pace.Although Universal has one of the lousiest track records in DVD history, I got the DVDs anyway, because: A) didn't feel the need to get it on Blu-Ray [at least not yet, nor for a first viewing], B) I don't do streaming-type stuff; and C) the prices tend to be low anyway [that is, now they are].If streaming/download/hulu works for you, great. I don't know if the available Blu-Ray is U.S. Region. As for DVD-- always get new as opposed to used; Universal discs are already prone to strange and atrocious malfunctions as it is. (For the record, my set had one freeze in one episode, but I got around it by playing affected episode from several seconds after the freeze) There are a handful of okay behind-the-scenes extras.

1300022,A91FE91BI7XIW,B002ZCY872,S. Fischer,"[6, 9]","Caprica is a spinoff-series of (new) Battlestar Galactica. Because it was a success, an American TV channel chose to make a prequel telling the story leading to Battlestar. Accordingly, Caprica takes place 58 years before Battlestar and has little direct relation to the characters of the previous series (the Adama family plays a role). The series is set in a confederation consisting of 12 planets that have evolved very differently. The main setting is the planet Caprica, which is technologically very advanced and quite wealthy. The main pastime of many people, especially teenagers, is a virtual reality world where sex, murder, crime etc. are possible without consequences. Some of the main characters of the series, especially Zoe Graystone and her friends, are repelled by this. Zoe as a rebellious teenager hates everything created by her father, a successful computer- and technology company boss and inventor, anyway. She therefore joins a fanatical cult that worships the 'one true God' and wants to force their faith on the rest of this polytheistic society with terrorist attacks. As a result, Zoe and hundreds of other people die in a bomb attack at the beginning of the series. But Zoe has left a perfect copy of herself in the virtual world. Her father tries to exploit this, firstly to get back his daughter, and secondly, to continue his - so far unsuccessful - development of an intelligent combat robot with the program Zoe wrote. Help comes from the father of another victim of the terrorist attack, which draws Dr. Graystone into the world of organized crime that's connected to immigrants of the poor and oppressed planet Tauron. And the religious fanatics also have an intense interest in the computer program and the fighting robots ...The idea behind the series is very interesting, the effects are excellent, and the actors are very well chosen. Relatively well known names are Eric Stoltz, Polly Walker and James Marsters, but many of the less well-known actors also enrich the series immensely. Nevertheless, it was cancelled after just one season with 18 episodes. There were probably two reasons: Firstly, it was broadcast extremely fragmentedly, so that between the beginning and the ending of only 18 episodes years elapsed. That was plain stupid. In addition, the series starts out very slowly and initially the (for many viewers rather annoying) character of Zoe was a little too much in the center. Only in the second half did the series get really exciting and the different plot lines finally came together. So it is not surprising, but very sad, that the series was canceled. What remains are 18 episodes, and the last fortunately gives a little insight into what would have happened in later seasons. Along with Battlestar Galactica you have a pretty good idea of &#8203;&#8203;what would have happened next, which makes the ending after just one series a little less frustrating. Of course it is still annoying that the show was not completed. Towards the end it was in fact very interesting. So for the series itself I'll give just under 4 stars.the Blu Ray-set from France:For reasons unknown, in most countries the series has been released on DVD only, usually split into two box sets. Especially with the effects and gorgeous settings &#8203;&#8203;offered by this science fiction series, one would like to see a better quality than DVDs can provide. At the time of my review, the only Blu-Ray version has been released in France. It is definitely worth buying (e. g. here or the French amazon site, where it's often cheaper). The picture and sound quality are very good. The Blu Ray is playable without any problems - as far as I know it is region free. On my device (a European, non-French player) it worked just fine, and I know of American buyers who have had no difficulties either. The menu is in French, but it can still be navigated easily. A French language version and the English original version are available with or without French or English subtitles. For the very generous bonus materials (documentaries, deleted scenes, lots of music - to my knowledge the complete soundtrack) the English version is available, with French subtitles that are - annoyingly - automatically switched on, but can be switched off with the remote control. All in all, you get the English original of the series and the bonus materials in excellent quality. It would be even better if the French subtitles weren't automatically switched on or if, as can be found on some European publications, you could choose between an English and a French menu. Nevertheless, I am very happy to have bought the Blu Ray and not the DVDs. So here, I will give a (good) 4 stars.",4,"Interesting series, very good Blu Ray set",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,4702,"['Caprica', 'spinoff-series', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'was',

1300026,A2ZMWGU610X3ZT,B002ZCY872,Solipso,"[1, 1]","CAPRICA is a SyFy Channel series including Season 1.0 with a two-part pilot and eight other episodes, and Season 1.5 with nine episodes. Contrary to some reviews and comments, CAPRICA has an ending. Yes, a gap exists between CAPRICA and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: BLOOD & CHROME and the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series proper, and there is room for another series in that gap. But the cinematic sequences at the end of CAPRICA's final episode make it clear that the end of the final episode was meant to be the end of the series.I say it is the best cinematic science fiction drama produced to date, including theatrical releases such as AVATAR. But who am I to say such a thing? Admittedly no one special. Just a humble fan of science fiction since I was a boy in the 1950s.Why is CAPRICA the best? I hope I do not need to convince you that the sensual aspects of action sequences and special effects are less fulfilling than the intellectual intricacies of drama and science, because the latter two are what make CAPRICA the best. It has powerful characterizations, superb scripting, and diverse storylines that absorb your interest as they move toward conjunction. What's more, the series has a tasteful thematic background that blends computer-science virtual reality with the psychology of being (ontology). More than once in your viewing--assuming a modicum of discernment on your part--you will be faced with the question, ""What must be present for the self to exist?""Rest assured that CAPRICA is not entirely cerebral; it does offer carnal excitement. The cinematography is not the best, though I expect it would be better in Blu-ray. Still, the standard DVD is agreeable. What is critical is that the environment is clean and bright, futuristic, and at times surprisingly convincing. Also, violent scenes are not done with timidity. (You might want to view the series before letting your rugrats view it.) Sexual scenes are more tame, however. No bare breasts or genitals, unless you watch the unrated, extended version of the Pilot.Be advised! After guzzling a six-pack of beer, you may not be able to keep track of what's going on. You need to respect this production and pay attention (enabling subtitles may help). But if you are looking for science fiction that offers more than laser-beam pyrotechnics and exploding starships, tune into this heady drama.",5,"To date, this is the best cinematic production of science fiction",1243036800,"05 23, 2009",2009,2360,"['CAPRICA', 'SyFy', 'Channel', 'series', 'including', 'Season', '1.0', 'two-part', 'pilot', 'eight', 'other', 'episodes', 'Season', '1.5', 'nine', 'episodes', 'Contrary', 'reviews', 'comments', 'CAPRICA', 'ending', 'Yes', 'gap', 'CAPRICA', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'BLOOD', 'CHROME', 'BATTLESTAR', 'GALACTICA', 'series', 'proper', 'room', 'series', 'gap', 'cinematic', 'sequences', 'end', 'CAPRICA', 'final', 'episode', 'make', 'clear', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'end', 'series.I', 'say', 'best', 'cinematic', 'science', 'fiction', 'drama', 'produced', 'date', 'including', 'theatrical', 'releases', 'such', 'AVATAR', 'who', 'am', 'say', 'such', 'thing', 'Admittedly', 'one', 'special', 'Just', 'humble', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'was', 'boy', '1950s.Why', 'CAPRICA', 'best', 'hope', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'convince', 'sensual', 'aspects', 'action', 'sequences', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'less', 'fulfilling', 'intellectual', 'intricacies', 'drama', 'science', 'latter', 'two', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'best', 'powerful', 'characterizations', 'superb', 'scripting', 'diverse', 'storylines', 'absorb', 'interest', 'move', 'conjunction', 'What', 'more', 'series', 'tasteful', 'thematic', 'background', 'computer-science', 'virtual', 'reality', 'psychology', 'being', 'ontology', 'More', 'once', 'viewing', 'assuming', 'modicum', 'discernment', 'part', 'will', 'be', 'faced', 'question', 'What', 'must', 'be', 'present', 'self', 'exist', 'Rest', 'assured', 'CAPRICA', 'not', 'entirely', 'cerebral', 'offer', 'carnal', 'excitement', 'cinematography', 'not', 'best', 'expect', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'Blu-ray', 'Still', 'standard', 'DVD', 'agreeable', 'What', 'critical', 'environment', 'clean', 'bright', 'futuristic', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'Also', 'violent', 'scenes', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'timidity', 'might', 'want', 'view', 'series', 'letting', 'rugrats', 'view', 'Sexual', 'scenes', 'are', 'more', 'tame', 'however', 'bare', 'genitals', 'watch', 'unrated', 'extended', 'version', 'Pilot.Be', 'advised', 'guzzling', 'six-pack', 'beer', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'going', 'need', 'respect', 'production', 'pay', 'attention', 'enabling', 'subtitles', 'may', 'help', 'are', 'looking', 'science', 'fiction', 'more', 'laser-beam', 'pyrotechnics', 'exploding', 'starships', 'tune', 'heady', 'drama']",Caprica: Season 1.0

There are a lot of things that work as answers setting here. We start out by seeing two men from two very different walks of life; one is a man that created an interface that takes internet living to another level and the other is a guy that does ""favors"" for people and makes the deaf hear. While their lives seem totally different, the two will find a connection in the most horrific of ways, leading them on the road to create A-I that ultimately causes a war.The things that happen in the pilot episodes are really amazing. They take the idea of what a technological planet is and then show you its dark underbelly, basically helping you to understand the minds of three young kids. Then you see the parents of these kids and you wonder about the motives of everyone and what will spark this Cyclon revolution.and then you get your answer.I know a lot of people loved B-G but, in the end of its run, I questioned the why behind it all. I really felt myself slipping away and did not want a taste of that again. The way B-G started out felt good but, really, the ending left much to the desires of many of us. Hopefully, Caprica is not the same. The acting is great, plot is twining, and the lines are fresh. There are even oddities in sexuality - things not expected, not oddities in the ""bad"" sense - and I loved that.
