There are times when we are literally running around in circles, because it seems like she's run out of ideas.  There's a sudden, short, almost frantic segment of higher impact exercises near the end, as though she realizes the workout is coming to an end and that she might want to step up the aerobic content.  Low-impact options also are given, which are basically just to keep walking.  In short, not a very inspired workout.  The young women doing the routine seem to be lackadaisical about it, including Denise herself.

I really enjoy it and the time goes by very quickly. There is nothing dancy for a non-dancer like me, even though Denise Austin likes to throw in dance moves sometimes. The routine takes some room for those who have a small space. You walk back and forth to the side doing side steps and walking to the side. You also walk to the front. My apartment is a little small to do more than three walks to the front. She usually does about four, so not too much of a difference. There are knee raises, walking in place, and other things like that. It is great for beginners or those who are very obese ( as I am). The routine lasts a good 30 minutes.I usually do two workouts together when I do this tape for a total of an hour workout. Oh, and lower impact moves are offered when she does higher impact which I really like.

The workout is great for low impact or higher impact people.  One set of girls are doing the higher impact while the other set of girls are doing the lower impact.

1661363,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,B00DUGBZL4,Little Miss Cutey,"[2, 4]","This workout is fine if you're an absolute beginner.  It's enough to get your heart rate up and burn some calories, but it's not enough - I don't believe - for serious weight loss.  Plus, I swear Denise is missing a screw or two.  After all the years in this business, you'd think someone would have taught her how to instruct a DVD.  There's music for a reason; i.e., using the music to move to in time to the beat.  Instead she, once again, continuously moves faster or slower than the music which is quite off putting.  She also doesn't give much notice for some changes of movement.  One minute you're doing kicks or simple marches, and the next she says that you're moving on to Charleston type steps, and before you can blink, you're already doing them with no instruction on how they're done.  And also, there's never enough repetition to really work a specific set of muscles.  You do a particular movement for one set and then it's on to something new.Apart from the fact that the background exercisers know what they're doing, you could swear this was put together at the last minute with no practice or anything.  I should have learned from the last couple of Denise Austin DVD purchases I made, but I keep thinking she'll finally get it right.

1661364,A2HH0D6MEQMPGZ,B00DUGBZL4,"N. Worland ""Modern Fitness and Music Loving Mom""","[76, 77]","I was skeptical about puchasing this workout because I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone (and let's face it, Leslie is the Queen of walking workouts, so she sets the bar here).  I was pleasantly surprised!  I am a big fan of Denise Austin, and she is her usual bubbly self.  If you don't like Denise's personality I suggest you skip this one.  At first I thought this would be too beginner-ish, but once you get past the warmup, she picks up the pace.  There are some high impact moves (with the option to stay low impact).  I loved having the high impact options and really worked up a sweat and burned more calories than expected (I use a heart rate monitor to track calories burned).  Denise walks with two back-up people to her left and two to the right.  The two on the left do the higher impact/intensity moves and the two on the right do the lower impact moves.  The workout consists of your typical walking DVD moves (walking in place and back and forth, she calls this ""easy walk"" throughout the workout, side to side step touches, hamstring curls, etc.  She also adds in some leg, arm, and ab toning exercises throughout.  The higher impact moves include jumping jacks, lateral skater jumps, jogging, fast feet (football runs), and rapid knee repeaters for the abs.  (One thing to note, in one section of the workout, she does some jogging (or walking) in a  circle to simulate running around a track, it is beneficial to have some space for this, but you could keep it small).  The workout ends with some dynamic stretching and breathing, followed by some short static stretching.  I also did the ""bonus"" 10 minute ab routine, which I enjoyed.  It included both standing and floor ab exercises.  I think it would be a nice stand-alone workout for when you are short on time or a good add-on to other workouts.  The reason why I have to give the DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because the music wasn't very good.  I have to admit, as the workout picked up towards the middle, the music got a little better, but I still wouldn't consider it ""good"".  It has a driving beat, so it serves its purpose, but it isn't memorable.  There is a music-only opion on the DVD.  The second reason I took off a star is that Denise says some annoying things throughout the entire walk portion of the workout (things about burning so much fat or losing a clothing size).  If you look at sample clips of the workout on youtube or other websites, you can get a better idea of what I mean.  These two things aren't deal-breakers for me.  There is one thing that was mentioned on fitness message boards about this workout that it isn't mirror cued.  This didn't bother me.  She starts on the left and I still mirror her.  I am a lefty, so I appreciate starting on that side.  She never says ""go left"" or ""go right"", she just says ""now go in the other direction"".  Overall, I think it was a fun walking workout with some higher intensity options that left me feeling great (not drained) and sweaty afterward.",4,Fun Walking Workout!!,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2989,"['was', 'skeptical', 'puchasing', 'workout', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Leslie', 'Sansone', 'let', 'face', 'Leslie', 'Queen', 'walking', 'workouts', 'bar', 'here', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'usual', 'bubbly', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Denise', 'personality', 'suggest', 'skip', 'one', 'first', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'beginner-ish', 'once', 'get', 'warmup', 'up', 'pace', 'are', 'high', 'impact', 'moves', 'option', 'stay', 'low', 'impact', 'loved', 'having', 'high', 'impact', 'options', 'really', 'worked', 'up', 'sweat', 'burned', 'more', 'calories', 'expected', 'use', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'track', 'calories', 'burned', 'Denise', 'two', 'back-up', 'people', 'left', 'two', 'right', 'two', 'left', 'do', 'higher', 'impact/intensity', 'moves', 'two', 'right', 'do', 'lower', 'impact', 'moves', 'workout', 'typical', 'walking', 'DVD', 'walking', 'place', 'back', 'forth', 'easy', 'walk', 'workout', 'side', 'side', 'step', 'touches', 'hamstring', 'curls', 'etc', 'also', 'leg', 'arm', 'ab', 'toning', 'exercises', 'higher', 'impact', 'moves', 'include', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'lateral', 'skater', 'jumps', 'jogging', 'fast', 'feet', 'football', 'rapid', 'knee', 'repeaters', 'abs', 'One', 'thing', 'note', 'one', 'section', 'workout', 'jogging', 'walking', 'circle', 'simulate', 'running', 'track', 'beneficial', 'have', 'space', 'could', 'keep', 'small', 'workout', 'dynamic', 'stretching', 'breathing', 'followed', 'short', 'static', 'stretching', 'also', 'did', 'bonus', '10', 'minute', 'ab', 'routine', 'enjoyed', 'included', 'standing', 'floor', 'ab', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'stand-alone', 'workout', 'when', 'are', 'short', 'time', 'good', 'add-on', 'other', 'workouts', 'reason', 'why', 'have', 'give', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'music', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'have', 'admit', 'workout', 'picked', 'up', 'middle', 'music', 'got', 'little', 'better', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'good', 'driving', 'beat', 'purpose', ""n't"", 'memorable', 'music-only', 'opion', 'DVD', 'second', 'reason', 'took', 'off', 'star', 'Denise', 'annoying', 'things', 'entire', 'walk', 'portion', 'workout', 'things', 'burning', 'so', 'much', 'fat', 'losing', 'clothing', 'size', 'look', 'sample', 'clips', 'workout', 'youtube', 'other', 'websites', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'mean', 'two', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'deal-breakers', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'mentioned', 'fitness', 'message', 'boards', 'workout', ""n't"", 'mirror', 'cued', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'left', 'still', 'mirror', 'am', 'lefty', 'appreciate', 'starting', 'side', 'never', 'go', 'left', 'go', 'right', 'just', 'now', 'go', 'other', 'direction', 'Overall', 'think', 'was', 'fun', 'walking', 'workout', 'higher', 'intensity', 'options', 'left', 'feeling', 'great', 'not', 'drained', 'sweaty', 'afterward']",Denise Austin: Fat Burning Walk
