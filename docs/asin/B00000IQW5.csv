It is a sweet love story, entertaining enough, and the characters are likable.  It's about life's loves and losses and people who truly care.  It's somewhat predictable, but enjoyable, and has romance for the ladies and action for the guys. Audrey Hepburn's appearance was a great addition to the film.  Such class, grace and beauty.  It's not my favorite film of all time, but I would watch it again and will add it to our video library.  I wish I had seen it in the theater.

I had not seen it in the theater, but it was during the maturing of Steven Spielberg.  Up to this point, most of the movies he made were hoot hollering action films, almost all of which were great.  Hit after hit they spilled out.  Around this time (1987-1990), Spielberg started taking on more adult-themed movies, probably because he was sick of being considered the kid.  Maybe he thought he wasn't be taken seriously enough.  He started with The Color Purple and then Empire of the Sun, and then this.  This movie actually looks more like a Lucas movie with the nostalgia-heavy themes.  I had heard from most people that this was a great film, but when I saw it, I was severely underwhelmed, which does not happen to me often where Spielberg is concerned.  I found that plot trite, slow, and not really all that interesting.  Frankly, it seemed to me to be a more serious version of 1941, which Spielberg himself disowned.  There was nothing about this film that would make me rave about it.  It is not bad, it is just not great, which is a problem with Spielberg because the bar is so high.  The movie is beautifully made and has all the hallmarks of the greatest living director today.  It just was not all that interesting to me.  I wish it was, because I heard so much good stuff about it and I was really rooting for it to be another great film.",1,I guess you can't win them all,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,1456,"['guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'all', 'be', 'hits', 'can', 'was', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'Spielberg', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'theater', 'was', 'maturing', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Up', 'point', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'were', 'hoot', 'hollering', 'action', 'films', 'almost', 'were', 'great', 'Hit', 'hit', 'spilled', 'out', 'time', '1987-1990', 'Spielberg', 'started', 'taking', 'more', 'adult-themed', 'movies', 'probably', 'was', 'sick', 'being', 'considered', 'kid', 'Maybe', 'thought', 'was', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'enough', 'started', 'Color', 'Purple', 'then', 'Empire', 'Sun', 'then', 'movie', 'actually', 'more', 'Lucas', 'movie', 'nostalgia-heavy', 'themes', 'had', 'heard', 'most', 'people', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'when', 'saw', 'was', 'severely', 'underwhelmed', 'not', 'happen', 'often', 'where', 'Spielberg', 'concerned', 'found', 'plot', 'trite', 'slow', 'not', 'really', 'interesting', 'Frankly', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'serious', 'version', '1941', 'Spielberg', 'disowned', 'was', 'nothing', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'rave', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'great', 'problem', 'Spielberg', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'movie', 'beautifully', 'made', 'hallmarks', 'greatest', 'living', 'director', 'today', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'wish', 'was', 'heard', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'stuff', 'was', 'really', 'rooting', 'be', 'great', 'film']",N/A
505014,AK6UVFSU07NXH,B00000IQW5,Anthony Hinde,"[18, 21]","Let's face it, there's damned few chances in life to root for the dead guy. And when the deceased is a fire fighting hero, a pilot and Richard Dreyfuss, you know your have to love him. But before I become too  premature, let's lay the groundwork. Actually that term is only half  correct for &quot;Always&quot;, as a lot of the action takes place in the  air. You see we are dealing with airborne smokeys, fire fliers who pilot  Air Tankers and dump thousands of  gallons of water on forest fires for  little pay, even less public recognition and no future.So there's  no prizes for guessing the outcome when we are introduced to one of the  more reckless pilots, Pete Sandich, who is in a non-committal relationship  with a beautiful Radio operator back at base, Dorinda Durston, played by  Holly Hunter. But before the inevitable, tragic accident, we are treated to  some quite romantic scenes. The best of which involves Pete gifting his  love with a stunning white cocktail dress. The timing could have been  better as she then has to dance with every roughneck fire-stomper in the  base.Pete's best friend, the improbably named Al Yackey, is played  by John Goodman. He actually has the best role in the film and whilst he  does offer much comic relief, there is much more meat on the character's  bones than just humour. In fact he is an integral part in putting all the  pieces back together following Pete's death.Interestingly, the  story doesn't really take off until Pete is ashes to ashes. You see the  afterlife is not all cheese and biscuits, laying back on  fluffy clouds.  There's work to do, inspiring the living to be the best they can be, or at  least to stop being such losers. Pete gets some on the job training from an  angelic supervisor called Hap, (Audry Hepburn), and is then pushed out into  the world to assist a wayward member of Gods great flock.This  particular sheep is called Ted Baker and he gets one of the best  descriptions in any film when Dorinder claims he is not her type, (too much  twisted steel and sex appeal). You see, it's Teds destiny to be with  Dorinda and hers to be with him. Unfortunately, Pete doesn't work that out  for some time because he is too busy trying to be a part of Dorinda's  life.There's a lot of room for emotional moments in this film, so  don't forget the tissues. I love the whole idea of the film. It's great to  watch Richard Dreyfuss weave his magic with a touching script. And John  Goodman is the perfect buddy for, first Pete and then Dorina. In the end we  have to forgive Ted for wanting to take Pete's girl. It is hard because we  can see Pete is still desperately in love with her. But when he turns the  corner and starts pulling for Ted, we can't help but follow.",4,Some souls burn brightly even after death.,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,2746,"['Let', 'face', 'damned', 'few', 'chances', 'life', 'root', 'dead', 'guy', 'when', 'deceased', 'fire', 'fighting', 'hero', 'pilot', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'know', 'have', 'love', 'become', 'too', 'premature', 'let', 'lay', 'groundwork', 'Actually', 'term', 'only', 'half', 'correct', 'quot', 'Always', 'quot', 'lot', 'action', 'place', 'air', 'see', 'are', 'dealing', 'airborne', 'smokeys', 'fire', 'fliers', 'who', 'pilot', 'Air', 'Tankers', 'dump', 'thousands', 'gallons', 'water', 'forest', 'fires', 'little', 'pay', 'even', 'less', 'public', 'recognition', 'future.So', 'prizes', 'guessing', 'outcome', 'when', 'are', 'introduced', 'one', 'more', 'reckless', 'pilots', 'Pete', 'Sandich', 'who', 'non-committal', 'relationship', 'beautiful', 'Radio', 'operator', 'back', 'base', 'Dorinda', 'Durston', 'played', 'Holly', 'Hunter', 'inevitable', 'tragic', 'accident', 'are', 'treated', 'quite', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'best', 'Pete', 'gifting', 'love', 'stunning', 'white', 'cocktail', 'dress', 'timing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'then', 'dance', 'roughneck', 'fire-stomper', 'base.Pete', 'best', 'friend', 'improbably', 'named', 'Al', 'Yackey', 'played', 'John', 'Goodman', 'actually', 'best', 'role', 'film', 'whilst', 'offer', 'much', 'comic', 'relief', 'much', 'more', 'meat', 'character', 'bones', 'just', 'humour', 'fact', 'integral', 'part', 'putting', 'pieces', 'back', 'together', 'following', 'Pete', 'death.Interestingly', 'story', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'off', 'Pete', 'ashes', 'ashes', 'see', 'afterlife', 'not', 'cheese', 'biscuits', 'laying', 'back', 'fluffy', 'clouds', 'work', 'do', 'inspiring', 'living', 'be', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'least', 'stop', 'being', 'such', 'losers', 'Pete', 'job', 'training', 'angelic', 'supervisor', 'called', 'Hap', 'Audry', 'Hepburn', 'then', 'pushed', 'out', 'world', 'assist', 'wayward', 'member', 'Gods', 'great', 'flock.This', 'particular', 'sheep', 'called', 'Ted', 'Baker', 'one', 'best', 'descriptions', 'film', 'when', 'Dorinder', 'not', 'type', 'too', 'much', 'twisted', 'steel', 'sex', 'appeal', 'see', 'Teds', 'destiny', 'be', 'Dorinda', 'hers', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'Pete', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'time', 'too', 'busy', 'trying', 'be', 'part', 'Dorinda', 'lot', 'room', 'emotional', 'moments', 'film', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'tissues', 'love', 'whole', 'idea', 'film', 'great', 'watch', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'weave', 'magic', 'touching', 'script', 'John', 'Goodman', 'perfect', 'buddy', 'first', 'Pete', 'then', 'Dorina', 'end', 'have', 'forgive', 'Ted', 'wanting', 'take', 'Pete', 'girl', 'hard', 'can', 'see', 'Pete', 'still', 'desperately', 'love', 'when', 'corner', 'pulling', 'Ted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'follow']",N/A

This movie had plenty of sad moments, and moments you were hoping the characters would find a way to escape the danger they were facing.  Sometimes they escaped, other times they didn't.The story mainly focuses on one man who died in an airplane accident, and a few months after he dies, he has to come back as an angel and help his girlfriend and her new boyfriend (who also happened to take an interest in the same kind of airplane job involving planes flying over forests and putting out fires).Many times the guy who died would whisper in the ears of the people he was trying to get a message across to, and every time he said something, his thoughts would be put into the heads of the people he was trying to communicate with.

But that's a minor mis-step. This is a deeply moving and affecting film, never more so than when Hunter and Dreyfus are on screen together. It's also got some outstanding aviation footage, and some studio blue-screen work that defies you to see exactly how it was done, so authentic does it look (though the basic trick is simple; instead of going for big closeups to minimize the sky around the cockpit canopy, Spielberg opts to keep the camera far enough away that a good deal of the [process] sky is visible: result - it looks much more like they're really flying). The editing, as always in Spielberg, is absolutely flawless. Check out the scene where Dreyfus' character has to nurse a limping B-25 back to base, landing with bits of tree stuck to his undercarriage, or the scene where his plane looks like it's going to be okay and then suddenly -- it's gone, and he's dead. John Goodman's horrified reaction is what sells that scene; I still get caught up in the emotion of it. Or for emotion, watch the later scene where Holly Hunter, now working with ATC, talks to John Goodman about how she feels about Dreyfus' character's death. Minor Spielberg? No such thing. Spielberg has one of the strongest narrative gifts of any film-maker working today, and his technical mastery of his craft is unparalleled. Put those two together and almost anything he wants to film will be compelling watching. Because he works within the studio system; because he's a commercial hit (almost always); because he has made himself into a very successful film businessman; for all these reasons, Spielberg is often put down by critics, and a good number of discriminating viewers. They should think again. Not every film-maker can be a Renoir, or a Kurosawa, or a Bergman, but, neither do they need to be such. There is room for every kind and degree of film-maker, and Spielberg's particular gifts are his alone, and shouldn't be put down, just because he doesn't come up to the critics' estimation of cinematic art. No artist ever always fired on all cylinders; there is also minor Bergman, and minor Kurosawa. This film may be minor Spielberg, but even so, it's a damn fine film, and well worth a spin. What it still doesn't have - in spite of the fact that Spielberg has said he likes the film to this day - is a good DVD presentation. Perhaps it will eventually be out on Blu-Ray. Until then, this non-anamorphic copy is all that's available.

505025,A396SBGKAOLTZE,B00000IQW5,Chris Aldridge,"[5, 6]","Spielberg deserves a fresh look. I open with that because as I read the decidedly mixed thoughts on this and other films of his, I notice the same thought over and over again. People who review Spielberg usually want to pigeonhole him into a type: the ET-warm-and-fuzzy-alien children's storyteller versus the special-effects-heavy-but-rather-empty-plot dreamer. All the while there is the generic whine of 'why doesn't he ever try to do something else (SCHINDLER'S LIST notwithstanding)?' Then when he does, as evidenced here, there are wails of dissatisfaction that he tried to do something over his head. Oy.It's so silly to label and categorize a filmmaker so much. ALWAYS is, first and foremost, a love story. A remake of an earlier film to be sure, but even this 1989 treatment looks and feels nostalgic with its amber-tinted cinematography, the sentimental presentation of the devoted fighter pilots, and the appearance of the ageless, magical Audrey Hepburn (sharp as a tack in her last film as a bright-eyed, no-nonsense angel).

One: I really like flying. Two: it had Richard Dreyfuss in it, one of my favorite underrated actors, and Three: An appearance by the lovable Audrey Hepburn. After watching it, I knew I had to have it. You'll like it too. The acting is superb by some of the greatest actors of our time. A surprising movie that will definitely keep your interest soaring.Fires are raging out of control in the forest. As one of the particapants of the containing of the fires, Pete (the likeable Richard Dreyfuss) is torn between his true loves, his tomboy girlfriend, Dorrinda (the beautiful Holly Hunter), and his career. His choices would be made too soon. When his friend Al (John Goodman, hilarious as ever) is in danger when his plane engine catches fire, Pete heads for the rescue, only to get killed himself.Not aware that anything has happened to him, he meets up with a strange yet kind angel named Hap (Audrey Hepburn's last role) who tells him what really happens. Pete has one more duty to do before leaving Earth. Hap gives gim an assignment, six months after his death, of helping a rookie fire fighter pilot named Ted (Brad Johnson in his first movie) in the ways of getting the job. Things don't go too well for Ted, for it is obvious he has a lot of work to do after dumping red fire retardent all over Al. Things begin to go for Ted, but bad for Pete as he begins to fall in love with Dorrinda.

This concerns the people around him, girlfriend Holly Hunter and best friend John Goodman, but Dreyfuss shruggs it off because this is what he does.  Finally Hunter convinces him he should take a job in Flat Rock, Colorado training pilots to do what he does.  Unfortunately he never makes it to Flat Rock, at least not in the flesh.  Not trying to give too much away, Dreyfuss comes back as a sort of guardian angel, forced to deal with two things: his love for Hunter and his duty to a young pilot she falls for.Always is a well made picture.  From Spielberg we expect nothing less, though I think his name hinders this film**.  The cinematography and the score are excellent as in all his films, as are the action sequences involving the planes.  However, the acting is the strongest part of this film.  This is the kind of role Dreyfuss shines in.  His fusion of wit and sincere emotion is wonderfull and he delivers some difficult monologues which would seem trite is lesser hands.  Holly Hunter and John Goodman are excellent as the people dealing with his loss.  Also Audrey Hepburn makes her final screen appearance in two scenes as an angel (how fitting).**I have this theory about Always.  It was almost universally panned by critics, but I think the criticism is directed more at Spielberg than at the film.  Certainly Spielberg has made better pictures, and perhaps this film was made on a grander scale than it needed to be, but I think if any other director had done this film it would not have received so much scrutiny.  But, I also believe in the hands of a lesser director this movie would not be as good.  Always combines action, humor, genuine sorrow, and happiness , and it combines them well, which is no small achievement.

Much of the negative criticism about his work is that his pictures are too happy: good wins over evil. That is the very reason Spielberg's films are so successful. The catharsis is always complete. However, even Spielberg can't save some films. Such is the case with ALWAYS.The film stars three great actors (John Goodman, Richard Dreyfuss, and Holly Hunter), has some of the most beautiful natural scenery in any Spielberg film, and a special appearance by Audrey Hepburn. The movie has a great beginning. At first viewing I thought to myself, &#34;This is going to be awesome, a movie about Forest Service pilots and Smoke Jumpers! No one has ever done anything like that before.&#34; The great humor during the first thirty minutes (subtly making fun, among other things, of movies and even Spielberg himself) further deluded me. Of course, I knew Richard Dreyfuss' character was going to die, but I thought the movie was then going to focus on how the people in his life coped after his death. I was partially right, but wasn't counting on him to continue starring in the movie as an &#34;unseen&#34; spirit. After his character's final moment alive on Earth, the movie went downhill like a plane on fire. It quickly left its humor and adventure, entering the territory of the non-believable, extremely sappy, romance. From then one out there is very little hope. There are a few memorable scenes: Holly Hunter &#34;cooking&#34; dinner, the dead bus driver who is revived, and the final shot of Richard Dreyfuss walking out of the film. However, these scenes don't feel right together. The feel like different pieces of a jigsaw puzzle glued together: they fit but don't really belong.

With all of the recent fires in Colorado and the pictures of planes dropping chemicals upon the raging forests below, this movie is a timely one to watch. It takes you into a world of firefighters, who fight a war of a different type.  It's not only about pilots who fly old planes into danger zones, it's a story of love between a hot-shot pilot (Pete, played by Richard Dreyfuss) and his girl, Dorinda (played by Holly Hunter), who works with the crew. The analogy that love can either be a flash fire that burns quickly, or one that burns slowly and lasts, is part of the message buried within the story.The movie is a great comedy, with Goodman playing Al, who is another pilot who doesn't take the fool-hearty chances that Pete does.  Between the two of them, there are some great laughs throughout show.  However, Dorinda knows if Pete keeps up his antics of taking chances, one day his number is going to be up. She has that premonition and asks him to quit and take a job as a trainer instead.  Reluctantly, Pete finally agrees, but not before one last flight that takes his life.The remainder of the story is a fantasy-filled adventure of Pete haunting Dorinda and Al.  Dorinda, can't move on, and Pete can't seem to let go. Al, is crazy Al, only now he's smart and teaching the younger generation to fly the planes above burning timber.It's a moving and funny movie that I've liked for many years.  Dreyfuss is at his best.  Goodman is funny.  Holly is heartfelt in her grief.  The life and atmosphere of the men and women who risk their lives to put out forest fires is an educational watch indeed.
