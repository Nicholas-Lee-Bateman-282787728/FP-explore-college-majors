303660,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302241251,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Patty Duke was at the height of her teenybopper fame when she starred in BILLIE (1965).  Modern audiences may sneer at it's depiction of a girl's fight for equality (which she ultimately drops), yet it's mix of teen angst and lively musical numbers is quite a delicious combo.15-year-old Billie Carol (Patty Duke) sets out to beat the boys at their own game by joining the highschool track team; a decision that could disrupt her entire family.  With her father (Jim Backus) busily campaiging for mayor, her sister (Susan Seaforth-Hayes) home from college with a guilty secret; and mother (Jane Greer) constantly talking about putting her head in the oven(!), Billie's antics could send them all over the edge!  In the end, Billie decides her greatest victory is just ""being a girl"", as the whole cast dances away into the night.  Yay!BILLIE is harmless fluff in the vein of ""Gidget"" and ""Beach Party"".  Patty Duke, at the very apex of her teen fame, is pert and perky in the lead, belting out songs like ""Funny Little Butterflies"".  Warren Berlinger is the boyfriend who feels threatened by Billie's sporting prowess, and ""That Girl""'s Ted Bessell also puts in a fun appearance.  The lively choreography comes courtesy of talented ""West Side Story"" cast member David (Baby John) Winters.  Keep an eye out for Broadway hoofer Donna McKechnie amongst the dancers.The DVD of BILLIE is truly appalling though.  Cropped and sliced into fullscreen, the image is full of telecine wobble and lots of grain (which could have been minimalised by keeping the film in it's original widescreen ratio).  The sound is in big fat mono with minor hiss and distortion evident throughout.  Extras are limited to the original trailer (which is presented in widescreen, another kick in the pants for those who would have loved the whole movie in widescreen).Fans of 60s kitsch should love BILLIE.  Despite a shoddy DVD presentation, this is a movie that deserves to be enjoyed.

I can only assume these are from people who were old enough to see the movie when they were young and Duke was still a star.  This 1965 quickie was a hit at the time because of Patty Duke's TV fame but time hasn't been particularly kind to it.  Young Patty Duke is predictably adorable as the tomboy who is asked to join the boys's track team, causing a mild stir in the small town where she lives and where her dad is running for mayor.  Billie's songs are uniformly terrible, although there is at least one pretty good dance number where Patty Duke tries to teach her teammates the beat, which is how she manages to run so fast.  The use of doggie reaction shots far exceeds what should be allowed in any movie aimed at audiences over five years old--this mostly feels like a subpar Disney film from the same period that might have starred Hayley Mills.Then there's the DVD transfer--the film was originally shot in scope but MGM opted for a very tight full-frame transfer that results in a lot of awkward looking too close close-ups and shots where two characters talking can barely manage to stay in the same frame.I would consider this for Patty Duke completists only--I doubt that anyone else would even be able to sit through it.",2,Mediocre movie and worse DVD,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,1298,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'positive', 'reviews', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'old', 'enough', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'Duke', 'was', 'still', 'star', '1965', 'quickie', 'was', 'hit', 'time', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'TV', 'fame', 'time', ""n't"", 'been', 'particularly', 'kind', 'Young', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'predictably', 'adorable', 'tomboy', 'who', 'asked', 'join', 'boys', 'track', 'team', 'causing', 'mild', 'stir', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'where', 'dad', 'running', 'mayor', 'Billie', 'songs', 'are', 'uniformly', 'terrible', 'least', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'dance', 'number', 'where', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'teach', 'beat', 'how', 'run', 'so', 'fast', 'use', 'doggie', 'reaction', 'shots', 'far', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'movie', 'aimed', 'audiences', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'mostly', 'subpar', 'Disney', 'film', 'same', 'period', 'might', 'have', 'starred', 'Hayley', 'Mills.Then', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'shot', 'scope', 'MGM', 'opted', 'very', 'tight', 'full-frame', 'transfer', 'results', 'lot', 'awkward', 'looking', 'too', 'close', 'close-ups', 'shots', 'where', 'two', 'characters', 'talking', 'can', 'barely', 'manage', 'stay', 'same', 'frame.I', 'would', 'consider', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'only', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'else', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'sit']",N/A

303668,A30TK6U7DNS82R,6302241251,Kevin Killian,"[2, 3]","Can't believe I've written hundreds of reviews and not a word on BILLIE, one of the most original screen musicals of the 1960s.  OK, maybe original isn't the right word.  Jim Backus is running for mayor of a small California city--is it California?  It must be--and his wife, Jane Greer, sulks and glowers in the corner in nearly every scene, pouting at her husband's foolish ways when he should be making love to her, making their marriage come alive again as it hasn't in many years.  She's still the same sultry kitten she was in OUT OF THE PAST with Kirk Douglas and Bob Mitchum, only she's got Jim Backus to play off of.  How did he become famous anyhow?  We all remember him from GILLIGAN's ISLAND and as James Dean's dad in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, but every time I see him onscreen, the phrase ""stunt casting"" runs through my mind.  Anyhow he's actually very good except that he looks awfully old; the makeup department does him no favors, though they were awfully helpful to Warren Berlinger, a nerdy type of actor here cast as the all American athlete Patty Duke has her heart set on.  There's a few shots towards the end, when he and Billie have their final heart to heart, where he looks absolutely like the young Ray Liotta.Patty Duke, well, what can I say.  She was still running on her manic energy in 1965 and this was one of her very best roles.  She's not as dumpy as other reviewers make her sound, although the dialogue in which the coach calls her ""five feet two and a half inches of speed"" is carefully contrived; surely she's not even five foot tall, she's tiny, and Susan Seaforth as her sexy older sister, home from a ""college back East"" and pregnant, towers over her even in flats; it's they're representing two different species in some Noah's Ark pageant of strange animals.  But Patty looks great with blonde hair, and she's very appealing and, dare I say it, rather sexy, in the tight fitting atheltic clothes teens wore in the old days I guess--now they look like dance leotards--Bob Fosse might have choreographed the big track meet in which humpy white boys in thigh hugging shorts carry triumphant, gender-variant Patty Duke high atop their heads, while the marching band plays an endless instrumental version of the title tune.Yes!  It is strange that in a musical, there's only 4 songs, and two of them are exactly the same and filmed in exactly the same way, only their lyrics are different.  Why?  Was it some sort of Lars Von Trier experiment?  There's a sinister, Dogme 95 air to the staging of both ""Lonely Little In Between"" and ""Funny Little Butterflies.""  If there's a remake of BILLIE, I would put Bjork in it right away, and Ben Gazzara could play the Jim Backus part, and it would be a fearsome condemnation of American politics, which it is already.",5,And That Horrible Sheepdog,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",2007,2795,"['Ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ve"", 'written', 'hundreds', 'reviews', 'not', 'word', 'BILLIE', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'screen', 'musicals', '1960s', 'OK', 'maybe', 'original', ""n't"", 'right', 'word', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'running', 'mayor', 'small', 'California', 'city', 'California', 'must', 'be', 'wife', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'sulks', 'glowers', 'corner', 'nearly', 'scene', 'pouting', 'husband', 'foolish', 'ways', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'making', 'love', 'making', 'marriage', 'come', 'alive', 'again', ""n't"", 'many', 'years', 'still', 'same', 'sultry', 'kitten', 'was', 'OUT', 'THE', 'PAST', 'Kirk', 'Douglas', 'Bob', 'Mitchum', 'only', 'got', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'play', 'off', 'How', 'did', 'become', 'famous', 'anyhow', 'remember', 'GILLIGAN', 'ISLAND', 'James', 'Dean', 'dad', 'REBEL', 'WITHOUT', 'A', 'CAUSE', 'time', 'see', 'onscreen', 'phrase', 'stunt', 'casting', 'mind', 'Anyhow', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'awfully', 'old', 'makeup', 'department', 'favors', 'were', 'awfully', 'helpful', 'Warren', 'Berlinger', 'nerdy', 'type', 'actor', 'here', 'cast', 'American', 'athlete', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'heart', 'set', 'few', 'shots', 'end', 'when', 'Billie', 'have', 'final', 'heart', 'heart', 'where', 'absolutely', 'young', 'Ray', 'Liotta.Patty', 'Duke', 'well', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'was', 'still', 'running', 'manic', 'energy', '1965', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'roles', 'not', 'as', 'dumpy', 'other', 'reviewers', 'make', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'coach', 'five', 'feet', 'two', 'half', 'inches', 'speed', 'carefully', 'contrived', 'surely', 'not', 'even', 'five', 'foot', 'tall', 'tiny', 'Susan', 'Seaforth', 'sexy', 'older', 'sister', 'home', 'college', 'back', 'East', 'pregnant', 'towers', 'even', 'flats', ""'re"", 'representing', 'two', 'different', 'species', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'pageant', 'strange', 'animals', 'Patty', 'great', 'blonde', 'hair', 'very', 'appealing', 'dare', 'say', 'rather', 'sexy', 'tight', 'fitting', 'atheltic', 'clothes', 'teens', 'wore', 'old', 'days', 'guess', 'now', 'look', 'dance', 'leotards', 'Bob', 'Fosse', 'might', 'have', 'choreographed', 'big', 'track', 'meet', 'humpy', 'white', 'boys', 'thigh', 'hugging', 'shorts', 'carry', 'triumphant', 'gender-variant', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'high', 'atop', 'heads', 'marching', 'band', 'endless', 'instrumental', 'version', 'title', 'tune.Yes', 'strange', 'musical', 'only', '4', 'songs', 'two', 'are', 'exactly', 'same', 'filmed', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'only', 'lyrics', 'are', 'different', 'Why', 'Was', 'sort', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'experiment', 'sinister', 'Dogme', '95', 'air', 'staging', 'Lonely', 'Little', 'Between', 'Funny', 'Little', 'Butterflies', 'remake', 'BILLIE', 'would', 'put', 'Bjork', 'right', 'away', 'Ben', 'Gazzara', 'could', 'play', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'part', 'would', 'be', 'fearsome', 'condemnation', 'American', 'politics', 'already']",N/A

Dad changes his tune when Billie becomes a track star, but his mayoral opponent has another family secret up his sleeve.Of course at the end Billie takes the 60s way out and decides she'd rather be a girl than a track star, which infuriates many people, but the film was actually very daring for 1965 with its ""everyone should do what they like"" theme: no one actually ever coerces Billie to leave the team, not her envious team-mates, or her father, or the boy who wants to be her boyfriend-it's Billie's decision to stop running, not anyone else's.This is just a nice pleasant rainy Saturday afternoon film with some great character actors, including Jane Greer, who plays Billie's mom who takes her husband with a grain of salt, the aforementioned Jim Backus, who wishes his little girl had been a boy (this leads to a very heart-rending scene where Dad refers to Billie as ""son""), Susan Seaforth before she did DAYS OF OUR LIVES, a pre-THAT GIRL Ted Bessell and pre-BEWITCHED Dick Sargent, and Patty Duke as Billie, who actually comes off very natural as a tomboyish girl who feels out of place with everyone.

303675,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,6302241251,Phil S.,"[1, 1]","I saw this movie back in 1965 and enjoyed it. Was a fan of The Patty Duke Show and Gilligan's Island, and so it was a very agreeble (probable) Saturday matinee for me.Duke and Backus were definitely in the upper ten of sitcom actors and they do an excellent job in this light comedy-drama with music. Their scenes together are the best in this bright, color opus out of old-time Hollywood. At the end, after the dust settles at the track met and at home, she says ""I love to you"" to her movie Dad with such emotion that Attila The Hun would tear up.Fans of Duke will enjoy her athleticism throughout the movie - at least she *appears* to be doing her own stunts...and her own dance moves.The songs and production numbers are first-rate but even for 1965 they slow down the pace and do not exactly fit the underlying serious theme of the movie: times were a-changin'. Women must have the same chance as men to make a buck.The movie loses alot of cache when the traditionalist Dad - Backus - running for mayor of a small town - quickly cahnges his position when he learns that ""Billie"" - PD - is basically taking over the High School track team. She has an internal ""beat"", which works for her and eventually works for the other members.The study of ""role"" versus indivuduality includes some very strong, dramatic dialogue, but just when the ""conflict"" on the field matches the confliuct at home...well, it suddenly takes on qualities of a typical sitcom. The denouement is predictable.If a cliche ever applies, this one has that ""feel good"" thing about it, though it *is* depressing to realize that around the time of ""Billie""'s release Patty Duke's film career went into decline and Backus continued to mug through three years on a very silly (but fun) show about people lost on an Island.",3,I made it thru!,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1789,"['saw', 'movie', 'back', '1965', 'enjoyed', 'Was', 'fan', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'Show', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'was', 'very', 'agreeble', 'probable', 'Saturday', 'matinee', 'me.Duke', 'Backus', 'were', 'definitely', 'upper', 'ten', 'sitcom', 'actors', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'light', 'comedy-drama', 'music', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'best', 'bright', 'color', 'opus', 'old-time', 'Hollywood', 'end', 'dust', 'settles', 'track', 'met', 'home', 'love', 'movie', 'Dad', 'such', 'emotion', 'Hun', 'would', 'tear', 'up.Fans', 'Duke', 'will', 'enjoy', 'athleticism', 'movie', 'least', '*appears*', 'be', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'own', 'dance', 'moves.The', 'songs', 'production', 'numbers', 'are', 'first-rate', 'even', '1965', 'slow', 'down', 'pace', 'do', 'not', 'exactly', 'fit', 'underlying', 'serious', 'theme', 'movie', 'times', 'were', 'a-changin', 'Women', 'must', 'have', 'same', 'chance', 'men', 'make', 'buck.The', 'movie', 'alot', 'cache', 'when', 'traditionalist', 'Dad', 'Backus', 'running', 'mayor', 'small', 'town', 'quickly', 'position', 'when', 'Billie', 'PD', 'basically', 'taking', 'over', 'High', 'School', 'track', 'team', 'internal', 'beat', 'eventually', 'other', 'members.The', 'study', 'role', 'versus', 'indivuduality', 'very', 'strong', 'dramatic', 'dialogue', 'just', 'when', 'conflict', 'field', 'confliuct', 'home', 'well', 'suddenly', 'qualities', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'denouement', 'cliche', 'ever', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'thing', 'depressing', 'realize', 'time', 'Billie', 'release', 'Patty', 'Duke', 'film', 'career', 'went', 'decline', 'Backus', 'continued', 'mug', 'three', 'years', 'very', 'silly', 'fun', 'show', 'people', 'lost', 'Island']",N/A

She's not interested in the things her other high school friends are.  Ironically, she doesn't feel like she fits in until she sets herself apart.  She's the fastest runner in high school, and it's all due to the beat.Billie (Patty Duke) hears a groovy 60's beat in her head, and the faster it goes, the faster she runs.  She's asked to try out for the boys' track team; this doesn't sit well with the community, causing problems for her father (Jim Backus) who is running for mayor.This 1965 movie has a ""Gidget"" feel or some of the live-action Disney films of that time, like ""The World's Greatest Athlete.""  It's clean, wholesome and charming.  Patty Duke is bouncy and bubbly in the role.  She also sings a couple of songs and dances surprisingly well.  There are a couple of very cute dance scenes with the kids learning `the beat,' and the choreography is great.This is a good quality DVD with popping color.

She tells her track coach that the secret to her incredible running ability, is the rock music 'beat' that she hears in her head, whenever she runs. Billie's athletic talent, causes considerable controversy for her politician father, who's running for Mayor of their town. He admits that he wishes Billie had been a boy. Billie herself, also wishes that she was a boy. She doesn't like having to tone-down her athletic prowess, just because she's a girl.Lots of folks think that Billie should behave more like a girl, and quit the boy's track team. But she's determined to stay on. Her father reluctantly supports her wish to be on the boy's track team. To further complicate matters, Billie falls for one of her teammates, who she had been tutoring to improve his track skills. He's surprised to find himself attracted to the tomboyish Billie, and wants her to start acting like a girl.Billie likes him, but wants him to accept her as an equal. His male ego is threatened by the fact that Billie can outrun him, since she's 'just a girl'. Billie doesn't like this, but she also doesn't want to lose her first boyfriend. Bewildered by her blossoming romantic feelings for him, Billie knows that she needs to make some important decisions, regarding her relationship with him.This movie belongs to Patty Duke, and she shines above the others in the supporting cast. Patty looks like a cute puppy-dog tomboy, and brings an intense energy to her role as Billie. After this film, Patty would never again appear so baby-faced and innocent, as she did in Billie. Patty also got to sing songs in the film, and she does have a nice voice.This movie was a charming, fun comedy, about a girl's journey through adolescence. It was made before the women's rights movement got underway. But it's plot was supportive of Billie's determination, to compete on an equal level with the boys on the track team.

303683,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,6302241251,the masked reviewer,"[2, 3]","Let's hope that the 1965 BILLIE is Hollywood's first and final women's lib track-and-field teen musical. Seemingly similar to other fare of the day like Take Her, She's Mine and I'll Take Sweden--snickering comedies about a father's discomfort over the budding of his suddenly comely teen daughter--Billie doesn't boast a standard-issue comedy starlet like Sandra Dee or Tuesday Weld; instead it offers up short, ungainly, butch Patty Duke. Hoping in vain to cover this miscasting, the title tune insistently blares, ""She looks like a Billie should look, wears her hair like a Billie should wear, walks like a Billie should, talks like a Billie should, on her a Billie looks good!""(erm...okay.)Even as Duke's jockeying-for-mayor dad Jim Backus is campaigning that women shouldn't compete against men, Duke's on the high school track field, showing new-kid-in-town Warren Berlinger how she races faster than sound, using her special trick of listening to ""the beat"" inside her head. Under her coaching, he improves, but it's Duke who's the speed demon, and when the coach sees her whiz by, he asks her to try out for the otherwise all-male track team.Aware Duke's racing could embarrass his campaign slant, ""liberal"" Backus supports her anyway--though, when Duke sighs, ""I wish I was a boy,"" he tells her the four little words every daughter's gotta hear sometime: ""Well, so do I!"" In her room, holding track shoes in one hand and a perfume bottle in the other, Duke belts such bizarre song lyrics--""What good is growing up, if this is all it means? I'm an in-between, a lonely little in-between!""--it seems the movie might veer off into a sex-change-op saga, Bill or Billie?, but no such luck.Duke makes the team, but is unhappy when given a dressing room away from the boys' locker room: she wants equality! Backus and wife Jane Greer wish Duke were more like her ultrafeminine, just-back-from-college sister Susan Seaforth, but when they learn just how well sis embodies Backus's new campaign slant, ""Everyone should be allowed to do exactly what they want""--she's secretly wed and pregnant--Backus rages, ""Somebody should have told me [your major] was sex!""Life magazine turns up to do a cover story on Duke, and she explains ""the beat"" in her noggin thusly: ""Track-and-field is like dance without music. And when you add the music, zoom--off you go!"" Duke and her pals teach ""the beat"" to the boys, resulting in a terrible go-go extravaganza out of an old Ann-Margret movie--but, since Duke can't much dance, she literally runs offscreen to allow A-M sub Donna McKechnie room to Watusi. Later, while slow dancing, Duke and Berlinger fall in love. Yep, she heads for her room to croon another solo, but we'll spare you the details.In another jaw-dropping production number, we learn the track team lads don't mind that Duke's always running yards ahead of them. Their song-and-dance about Duke's purported feminine charms inadvertently reveals their own: while singing, ""Though we can't outrace her, we love to chase her, she leaves a trail of sweet perfume--the girl is a girl is a girl, even in a locker room!"" the guys form a Rockettes-style kick line, and, yes, even pair off to do a two-step.(At this point, I had to send my youngest - little Jimmy jr - to retrieve mommy's special smelling salts from the medicine cabinet.)Unhappy that Berlinger treats her as ""a girl first,"" Duke angrily vows to beat him at the Big Track Meet. She wins the day--and a date with him to Backus's campaign gala. In a pink party dress, her hair teased to pass muster as a Dee do, Duke gushes, ""Being a girl is so much fun, I've decided to give up track."" Then, to let us know she'd only been flirting with feminism, she sings, ""I am the girl that's a girl and I'm proud as I can be! Just to be glad I'm a girl is my greatest victory!""
