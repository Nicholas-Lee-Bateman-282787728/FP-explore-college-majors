I realize that this film was one of his earliest projects - long before he hit his stride &amp; could dictate what films he wished to contribute to.  In the case of this movie, that point is exceedingly obvious.It seems like this DVD tries to be funny by being unfunny.  That's kind of like trying to satisfy your appetite by starving yourself.  Nothing in this film is funny - period.  It almost appears that it  is deliberately that way (kind of ironic for a comedy, wouldn't you say?).The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it does have some fairly attractive women wearing bikinis.  If it were not for that, I would give this one negative one stars instead of zero stars.There are some other Sandler movies that are of fairly high quality.  Do not make the mistake of believing this is one of them.

I picked this up for a buck thinking it would be worth seeing Adam Sandler's first feature film.  The only part that made it worthwhile was seeing the happy Madison guys so young. Sandler does a decent job and you can see how his career got launched.  Outside of that this movie is a train wreck.  The plot is a waste of time.  The acting is over the top and hammy.  On of the most egregious parts is the sound.  The only way people might like this is in its so bad its a cult classic thing.

190464,AD1JV9Y36NKPQ,1573625574,J. Nickerson,"[5, 6]","Ah, Going Overboard. The movie that would have never been released had Sandler not found success on SNL and Billy Madison. Yes, this movie is THAT bad, it makes Happy Gilmore look like Shakespear in comparison. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Sandler's movies... just not THIS one.A few minutes into the movie, Sandler pretty much admits to the audience that this was a &quot;no-budget&quot; flick and they were filming it because they happened to have access to a boat that day. And the movie goes downhill from there, if that's possible. Adam's character Shecky's quest to become the ship comedian is somehow tied with a revenge plot hatched by some third world dictator, and everything is slapped together by many scenes of women in bikinis and the same damn exterior shot of the ship used over and over and over. Despite how bad this movie is, you can definately see the seeds of what would become staples in Adam Sandler movies, such as the completely bizzare side characters and pathetically unhip bad guys. There are a few actual laughs in this movie, which is due from the movie not taking itself seriously, and be sure to look out for cast memeber that would later become regulars in future Sandler movies.Only hardcore Sandler fans would want this movie, if only just to see how their favorite star started out.
