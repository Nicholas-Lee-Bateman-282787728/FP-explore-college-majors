1660022,A294WLBCDQ90O7,B00DOQK5NO,Anonymity,"[7, 13]","Hate Crime (2013)Rated on a 10 point scale.WARNING: This review contains spoilers.Right from the opening scene we are subjected to yet another hand-held, home video style approach to the story, and not only is this completely uninspiring, but downright irritating, considering the plot and events of the movie. (-3 points)The next sign of an uncreative and mediocre director comes when the home invaders, who happen to be neo-Nazis, immediately kill the little boy, without even a small amount of abuse or torture. It becomes clear this was done, because the director lacked the backbone to portray what would have really happened to the youngest family member in a real hate crime. Giving a clean kill to the youngest child simply because of his age was utterly unrealistic and sets the stage for how often  this film, which is supposedly shocking, pulls its punches and falls short of its goal. (-2 points)Way too much screaming! Apparently, the director only knows how to portray emotion in one-dimensional ways: hate = you scream, fear = you scream, anger = you scream. Coupled with the unoriginal and jerky camera work, this makes for a horrible watching experience, not because the film is disturbing, but because it is annoying. (-2 points)Poor production value is also very apparent throughout the movie. This has nothing to do with budget, but more with bad direction and cinematography. Punches that so very obviously never make contact with the target are abundant. Small details, like the ridiculous ropes around the lounge chairs, from which any human could simply slide out, also turn this into more of a comedy of errors than a serious film. (-2 point)sFinal score: 1/10Hate crime in real life is a horrible, powerful, and prevalent problem everywhere in the world. Hate Crime, the film, fails to understand that some things are best presented in a simple but unflinching fashion, without the use of tired gimmicks and overacting. There is nothing shocking or disturbing in this movie; more importantly, there is nothing worth watching - this movie screams film-school is every possible, horrible way.",1,Unimpressive,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,2116,"['Hate', 'Crime', '2013', 'Rated', '10', 'point', 'scale.WARNING', 'review', 'spoilers.Right', 'opening', 'scene', 'are', 'subjected', 'yet', 'hand-held', 'home', 'video', 'style', 'approach', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'completely', 'uninspiring', 'downright', 'irritating', 'considering', 'plot', 'events', 'movie', '-3', 'points', 'next', 'sign', 'uncreative', 'mediocre', 'director', 'when', 'home', 'invaders', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'neo-Nazis', 'immediately', 'kill', 'little', 'boy', 'even', 'small', 'amount', 'abuse', 'torture', 'clear', 'was', 'done', 'director', 'lacked', 'backbone', 'portray', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'happened', 'youngest', 'family', 'member', 'real', 'hate', 'crime', 'Giving', 'clean', 'kill', 'youngest', 'child', 'simply', 'age', 'was', 'utterly', 'unrealistic', 'stage', 'how', 'often', 'film', 'supposedly', 'shocking', 'punches', 'short', 'goal', '-2', 'points', 'Way', 'too', 'much', 'screaming', 'Apparently', 'director', 'only', 'how', 'portray', 'emotion', 'one-dimensional', 'ways', 'hate', 'scream', 'fear', 'scream', 'anger', '=', 'scream', 'Coupled', 'unoriginal', 'jerky', 'camera', 'work', 'horrible', 'watching', 'experience', 'not', 'film', 'disturbing', 'annoying', '-2', 'points', 'Poor', 'production', 'value', 'also', 'very', 'apparent', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'budget', 'more', 'bad', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'Punches', 'so', 'very', 'obviously', 'never', 'make', 'contact', 'target', 'are', 'abundant', 'Small', 'details', 'ridiculous', 'ropes', 'lounge', 'chairs', 'human', 'could', 'simply', 'slide', 'out', 'also', 'turn', 'more', 'comedy', 'errors', 'serious', 'film', '-2', 'point', 'sFinal', 'score', '1/10Hate', 'crime', 'real', 'life', 'horrible', 'powerful', 'prevalent', 'problem', 'everywhere', 'world', 'Hate', 'Crime', 'film', 'understand', 'things', 'are', 'best', 'presented', 'simple', 'unflinching', 'fashion', 'use', 'tired', 'gimmicks', 'overacting', 'nothing', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'more', 'importantly', 'nothing', 'worth', 'watching', 'movie', 'film-school', 'possible', 'horrible', 'way']",Hate Crime

The home invaders break into the house instantly and really up the anty and tension. It is found footage at it's finest and feels like the home video scene in Henry but as a full film.

1660026,A2QVZIGRMOM3UP,B00DOQK5NO,Jonny Roy's film interests,"[1, 1]","Film : Hate CrimeDirector : James Cullen BressackStars:  Jody Barton, Nicholas Adam Clark, Greg DepetroBefore I get into this one, I must admit, without any intention of comparing a film to another one that if there is something that gets me interested every damn time about film, are subjects such as the one in HATE CRIME. Racism, discrimination, human rights are all things exploited in movies such as SHINDLER'S LIST, A TIME TO KILL, and the extraordinary AMERICAN HISTORY X. These films, for a reason or another all got me to my stomach and I haven't forgotten any of them since. And James Cullen Bressack's HATE CRIME qualifies as one of them. But, nope, scratch that part. Should it be different, HATE CRIME's far closer to a pure horror film than a Drama. Call me a pussy, call me too sensitive, at first I wasn't too sure if I should test myself with this film, but something inside me felt like I had to. So I took the red pill and watched it.HATE CRIME is the story of a Jewish family. New to their neighborhood, they're about to celebrate their son's birthday. They want to immortalize the event on tape but soon after the party begins, a bunch of crazy, stoned neo Nazi lunatics storm in the house.This is all I need to give away if you haven't seen the film yet and maybe intend to test yourself. The nightmare that follows starts within about the first 5 minutes of the film and it doesn't let go until the very end. Turning that film into a survival experience, in which a desperate family becomes hostage of a group of people that obviously hate them.Most of the time, the visual style of HATE CRIME, which involves letting an actor run with the camera surprisingly serves the overall film pretty well with allowing the film maker to get as close as the action as he wants you to be and instead of making you feel for the sympathetic characters, just simply making you resent the fear, the anger, the cries and all the emotions storming inside the protagonists. HATE CRIME manages at times to challenge the viewer. I must admit that I've been tested on more than one occasion as this night which started as a quiet, birthday evening became such a fierce and crazy night of crimes beyond what I could have imagined. And that is why I won't spoil you in this review with much about the disaster that occurs but rest assure that pushing beyond the limits isn't something that this film shies away from, as I thought that only animal cruelty and violence and abuse on child and women could happen to make me uncomfortable in horror films anymore.There are very few weaknesses for this one that doesn't really bother the entire work. For instance, one of the masked assailants, the biggest one's voice will appear incredibly hard to hear clearly through his mask, making his dialogues hard to understand for the first minutes of the ordeal. But one can thank the need to take himself into such a horrific ride, or the will to see the protagonists' triumph, the film builds a strength for itself that far exceeds the little flaws. I felt like I must see this film and I did. This one is a rewarding piece of indie film overall. And I'm really looking forward into James Cullen Bressack's future in film as I'm looking to have the chance to see more of his past work. Including the intriguing: TO JENNIFER.You may want to experience this one alone, as it is a certain party crasher. Some people may hate you for starting this flick in the middle of a warm, friendly beer discussion among friends!",4,True nature of a Hate Crime,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,3506,"['Film', 'Hate', 'CrimeDirector', 'James', 'Cullen', 'BressackStars', 'Jody', 'Barton', 'Nicholas', 'Adam', 'Clark', 'Greg', 'DepetroBefore', 'get', 'one', 'must', 'admit', 'intention', 'comparing', 'film', 'one', 'something', 'interested', 'damn', 'time', 'film', 'are', 'subjects', 'such', 'one', 'HATE', 'CRIME', 'Racism', 'discrimination', 'human', 'rights', 'are', 'things', 'exploited', 'movies', 'such', 'SHINDLER', 'LIST', 'A', 'TIME', 'TO', 'KILL', 'extraordinary', 'AMERICAN', 'HISTORY', 'X', 'films', 'reason', 'got', 'stomach', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'James', 'Cullen', 'Bressack', 'HATE', 'CRIME', 'one', 'nope', 'scratch', 'part', 'Should', 'be', 'different', 'HATE', 'CRIME', 'far', 'closer', 'pure', 'horror', 'film', 'Drama', 'Call', 'pussy', 'call', 'too', 'sensitive', 'first', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'should', 'test', 'film', 'something', 'felt', 'had', 'So', 'took', 'red', 'pill', 'watched', 'it.HATE', 'CRIME', 'story', 'Jewish', 'family', 'New', 'neighborhood', ""'re"", 'celebrate', 'son', 'birthday', 'want', 'immortalize', 'event', 'tape', 'soon', 'party', 'bunch', 'crazy', 'stoned', 'neo', 'Nazi', 'lunatics', 'storm', 'house.This', 'need', 'give', 'away', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'yet', 'maybe', 'intend', 'test', 'nightmare', 'starts', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'film', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'very', 'end', 'Turning', 'film', 'survival', 'experience', 'desperate', 'family', 'hostage', 'group', 'people', 'obviously', 'hate', 'them.Most', 'time', 'visual', 'style', 'HATE', 'CRIME', 'letting', 'actor', 'run', 'camera', 'surprisingly', 'overall', 'film', 'pretty', 'well', 'allowing', 'film', 'maker', 'get', 'as', 'close', 'action', 'be', 'instead', 'making', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'just', 'simply', 'making', 'resent', 'fear', 'anger', 'cries', 'emotions', 'storming', 'protagonists', 'HATE', 'CRIME', 'times', 'challenge', 'viewer', 'must', 'admit', ""'ve"", 'been', 'tested', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'night', 'started', 'quiet', 'birthday', 'evening', 'became', 'such', 'fierce', 'crazy', 'night', 'crimes', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'imagined', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'review', 'much', 'disaster', 'rest', 'assure', 'pushing', 'limits', ""n't"", 'something', 'film', 'away', 'thought', 'only', 'animal', 'cruelty', 'violence', 'abuse', 'child', 'women', 'could', 'happen', 'make', 'uncomfortable', 'horror', 'films', 'anymore.There', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'weaknesses', 'one', ""n't"", 'really', 'bother', 'entire', 'work', 'instance', 'one', 'masked', 'assailants', 'biggest', 'one', 'voice', 'will', 'appear', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'hear', 'clearly', 'mask', 'making', 'dialogues', 'hard', 'understand', 'first', 'minutes', 'ordeal', 'one', 'can', 'thank', 'need', 'take', 'horrific', 'ride', 'will', 'see', 'protagonists', 'triumph', 'film', 'strength', 'far', 'little', 'flaws', 'felt', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'did', 'one', 'rewarding', 'piece', 'indie', 'film', 'overall', ""'m"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'James', 'Cullen', 'Bressack', 'future', 'film', ""'m"", 'looking', 'have', 'chance', 'see', 'more', 'past', 'work', 'Including', 'intriguing', 'TO', 'JENNIFER.You', 'may', 'want', 'experience', 'one', 'alone', 'certain', 'party', 'crasher', 'people', 'may', 'hate', 'starting', 'flick', 'middle', 'warm', 'friendly', 'beer', 'discussion', 'friends']",Hate Crime

I watched it and didn't take one sip of my coffee. It grabs your sick interest from start to finish.""James did a great job with all the action and thrilling moments in one location, which is very challenging.  The attackers will anger you, but sadly some of the smart ass comments that come out of their mouths are a little comical.  Unfortunately, after I giggled I felt guilty.  Especially since this film is highly possible as there's many incidents of this ruthless Neo Nazi group committing heinous crimes.  In the film, right off the bat they commit some shocking acts.Their actions indicate they must be on something and later it's exposed what's adding to their psychoses.  The family truly act scared and I'm sure feeding off One, Two, and Three made it easier for them.Bathroom scene being a father made me upset....okay a lot was upsetting but that was a moment of less anger and true psychotic moment. Fortunately the daughter could...well you need to watch it.In addition to the horror, the film shows how psychopaths are emotionally unstable and when something doesn't go their way, they struggle to handle it.To summarize, there's a long list of upsetting moments in this film and the reality aspect of it makes it worse.
