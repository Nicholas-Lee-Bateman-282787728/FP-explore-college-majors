87435,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,0790719029,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 0]","I miss these kinds of adventure films. You generally don't see adventure films that prove to be tons of fun and heart-warming at the same. This film is a great and moving adventure, and its a film that does have something to say and its environmental politics are very well done. However, I'm deeply disappointed with the mixed reception of this film. How is it that a great environmental film (That was also pretty clean, having no innuendos and very little violence and cursing) have a mediocre 5.4 out of 10 on the Internet Movie Database, yet when I look at the page for Happy Feet (Which was a horrible, horrible environmental film crammed with very noticeable innuendos and racism) have a 6.7 out of 10? Bad moviegoers! BAD!! If you want to see a film that is truly a great adventure and uses environmental politics well, watch this because kids and adults can get into it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Jesse is a 12-year-old boy whose mother abandoned him when he was six and now he's mostly a street kid. But when he vandalizes an aquarium, he is caught, arrested, forced to clean up the mess he made, and gets taken in by foster parents. While he's cleaning up, he starts to become fascinated with the killer whale in the tank named Willy. Willy is a whale that does not seem to like anyone and will not perform. Slowly but surely, Jesse and Willy start to grow a bond with each other. But things get more sinister as they go along and then it's up to Jesse (As well as some other people) to try and save Willy from his owners who want him dead for a $1 million insurance policy.MUSIC: The musical score is very good, and I'll even say I liked the Michael Jackson they played in the film. As an adventure film should, it has great music, so no gripes here.ACTING: Though there were some slip-ups, everyone was pretty good. I must give credit to Jason James Richter's performance because generally kid actors suck (There are very few films I've seen in which good kid actors were cast). Though most of the these actors are no longer recognizable in this day and age, their performances are still solid.ACTION: This film was never boring to watch. Just watching Keiko (The whale that plays Willy) was entertaining because there's always something oddly captivating about whales. Watching him do tricks was always cool. This film also spends a good portion talking about the character Jesse and it does it extremely well because you do actually care about these characters and their problems. Needless to say, this film always had something going on, even if it wasn't action-packed. It's a heart-warming experience that can prove to be rather emotional too. Not to mention, the ending rules.OVERALL: This is a really awesome adventure film that has not aged a bit. I do hope the ratings on some sites do go up because this a great film that does not deserve the bashing it gets. This is a film that both kids and adults alike can enjoy. As for the sequels? Well I haven't seen the second or third (Apparently there's also a fourth film in the works which is pointless since apparently the actors from the previous films will not even be returning and the whale that played Willy is dead), but I will keep a look out for them and then review them for another time.THE GOOD: Great storyline, good acting, great music, it was never boring, it was heart-warming and emotional, and just watching the whale was entertaining.THE BAD: Acting slip-ups.",5,A GREAT ADVENTURE THAT STILL REMAINS TIMELESS  9 OUT OF 10,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,3437,"['miss', 'kinds', 'adventure', 'films', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'adventure', 'films', 'prove', 'be', 'tons', 'fun', 'heart-warming', 'same', 'film', 'great', 'moving', 'adventure', 'film', 'have', 'something', 'say', 'environmental', 'politics', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'However', ""'m"", 'deeply', 'disappointed', 'mixed', 'reception', 'film', 'How', 'great', 'environmental', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'clean', 'having', 'innuendos', 'very', 'little', 'violence', 'cursing', 'have', 'mediocre', '5.4', '10', 'Internet', 'Movie', 'Database', 'yet', 'when', 'look', 'page', 'Happy', 'Feet', 'Which', 'was', 'horrible', 'horrible', 'environmental', 'film', 'crammed', 'very', 'noticeable', 'innuendos', 'racism', 'have', '6.7', '10', 'Bad', 'moviegoers', 'BAD', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'truly', 'great', 'adventure', 'environmental', 'politics', 'well', 'watch', 'kids', 'adults', 'can', 'get', 'it.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'Jesse', '12-year-old', 'boy', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'six', 'now', 'mostly', 'street', 'kid', 'when', 'aquarium', 'caught', 'arrested', 'forced', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'made', 'taken', 'foster', 'parents', 'cleaning', 'up', 'become', 'fascinated', 'killer', 'whale', 'tank', 'named', 'Willy', 'Willy', 'whale', 'not', 'seem', 'like', 'anyone', 'will', 'not', 'perform', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'Jesse', 'Willy', 'start', 'grow', 'bond', 'other', 'things', 'get', 'more', 'sinister', 'go', 'along', 'then', 'up', 'Jesse', 'As', 'well', 'other', 'people', 'try', 'save', 'Willy', 'owners', 'who', 'want', 'dead', '1', 'million', 'insurance', 'policy.MUSIC', 'musical', 'score', 'very', 'good', ""'ll"", 'even', 'say', 'liked', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'played', 'film', 'adventure', 'film', 'should', 'great', 'music', 'gripes', 'here.ACTING', 'were', 'slip-ups', 'everyone', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'performance', 'generally', 'kid', 'actors', 'suck', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'good', 'kid', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'most', 'actors', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'recognizable', 'day', 'age', 'performances', 'are', 'still', 'solid.ACTION', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'boring', 'watch', 'Just', 'watching', 'Keiko', 'whale', 'Willy', 'was', 'entertaining', 'always', 'something', 'oddly', 'captivating', 'whales', 'Watching', 'do', 'tricks', 'was', 'always', 'cool', 'film', 'also', 'good', 'portion', 'talking', 'character', 'Jesse', 'extremely', 'well', 'do', 'actually', 'care', 'characters', 'problems', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'always', 'had', 'something', 'going', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'action-packed', 'heart-warming', 'experience', 'can', 'prove', 'be', 'rather', 'emotional', 'too', 'Not', 'mention', 'ending', 'rules.OVERALL', 'really', 'awesome', 'adventure', 'film', 'not', 'aged', 'bit', 'do', 'hope', 'ratings', 'sites', 'do', 'go', 'up', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'deserve', 'bashing', 'film', 'kids', 'adults', 'alike', 'can', 'enjoy', 'sequels', 'Well', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'second', 'third', 'Apparently', 'also', 'fourth', 'film', 'works', 'pointless', 'apparently', 'actors', 'previous', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'returning', 'whale', 'played', 'Willy', 'dead', 'will', 'keep', 'look', 'out', 'then', 'review', 'time.THE', 'GOOD', 'Great', 'storyline', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'was', 'never', 'boring', 'was', 'heart-warming', 'emotional', 'just', 'watching', 'whale', 'was', 'entertaining.THE', 'BAD', 'Acting', 'slip-ups']",N/A

87437,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0790719029,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","As a young boy, I watched `Free Willy' probably weekly and teared up every time I heard `Will You Be There' on the radio or watched the music video for it that ran before my VHS copy of `Free Willy' started to play.  Yes, this movie was my everything for at least a full year and I still have this deepseated love for it.That being said, watching this recently had me cringing at a lot of spots, especially with regards to the spotty acting by the entire cast and I found myself remembering a better movie than I was watching.Still, for a family film about love, growth, acceptance and fighting for the rights of others, this is a great bench march for all of those things.  Telling the story of young orphan Jesse who is lashing out at authority thanks to being rejected by those who are supposed to love him, we meet Jesse just as he's facing serious Juvi time.  Instead, he is sent to live with the Greenwoods.  Annie and Glen want a child, and they try to smother him with attention and love and yet he rejects them coldly and leaves them wondering if this was the right decision after all.  Jesse is saddled with the responsibility of cleaning up his messes (he vandalized a local aquarium) and that is where he meets Willy, an orca whale, and begins to bond with him.The story of their bond and Jesse's eventual growth as a person is rather touching, even if it rides a thin line at the end and becomes somewhat redundant in themes.  It has a great message about the rights of others (animal or human) but I feel as though it doesn't completely sell them as strongly as it could have (then again, this is a kids movie).  I also find it a tad odd that this movie is basically condemning the very thing it is exploiting (using captive animals for entertainment purposes).  Still, it is the cast of terrible actors that drags this down for me.  Jason James Richter was a terrible find (it's telling that he only did the Free Willy films and then fizzled into obscurity) and the rest of the cast, which usually offer at least decent performances (Petty, Madsen) all fumble pretty badly here.  The clich&eacute;d nature of the handling of his adoption feels forced, and the life lessons he learns are done in a very straightforward and underwhelming way, despite being somewhat effective.It's a family film from Disney and it feels very much like one of their many family oriented offerings.  Nothing exceptional and yet hardly offensive, it's a forgivable film that still holds a place in my heart no matter how disappointed I am with this as an adult.",3,"Free of all bias, I give you my take on this nostalgic classic...",1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2554,"['young', 'boy', 'watched', 'Free', 'Willy', 'probably', 'weekly', 'teared', 'up', 'time', 'heard', 'Will', 'Be', 'radio', 'watched', 'music', 'video', 'ran', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Free', 'Willy', 'started', 'play', 'Yes', 'movie', 'was', 'everything', 'least', 'full', 'year', 'still', 'have', 'deepseated', 'love', 'it.That', 'being', 'said', 'watching', 'recently', 'had', 'cringing', 'lot', 'spots', 'especially', 'regards', 'spotty', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'found', 'remembering', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'watching.Still', 'family', 'film', 'love', 'growth', 'acceptance', 'fighting', 'rights', 'others', 'great', 'bench', 'march', 'things', 'Telling', 'story', 'young', 'orphan', 'Jesse', 'who', 'lashing', 'out', 'authority', 'thanks', 'being', 'rejected', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'love', 'meet', 'Jesse', 'just', 'facing', 'serious', 'Juvi', 'time', 'Instead', 'sent', 'live', 'Greenwoods', 'Annie', 'Glen', 'want', 'child', 'try', 'smother', 'attention', 'love', 'yet', 'coldly', 'wondering', 'was', 'right', 'decision', 'Jesse', 'saddled', 'responsibility', 'cleaning', 'up', 'messes', 'vandalized', 'local', 'aquarium', 'where', 'Willy', 'orca', 'whale', 'bond', 'him.The', 'story', 'bond', 'Jesse', 'eventual', 'growth', 'person', 'rather', 'touching', 'even', 'thin', 'line', 'end', 'somewhat', 'redundant', 'themes', 'great', 'message', 'rights', 'others', 'animal', 'human', 'feel', ""n't"", 'completely', 'sell', 'as', 'strongly', 'could', 'have', 'then', 'again', 'kids', 'movie', 'also', 'find', 'tad', 'odd', 'movie', 'basically', 'condemning', 'very', 'thing', 'exploiting', 'using', 'captive', 'animals', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'Still', 'cast', 'terrible', 'actors', 'down', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'was', 'terrible', 'find', 'telling', 'only', 'did', 'Free', 'Willy', 'films', 'then', 'fizzled', 'obscurity', 'rest', 'cast', 'usually', 'offer', 'least', 'decent', 'performances', 'Petty', 'Madsen', 'fumble', 'pretty', 'badly', 'here', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'nature', 'handling', 'adoption', 'feels', 'forced', 'life', 'lessons', 'are', 'done', 'very', 'straightforward', 'underwhelming', 'way', 'being', 'somewhat', 'effective.It', 'family', 'film', 'Disney', 'very', 'much', 'one', 'many', 'family', 'oriented', 'offerings', 'Nothing', 'exceptional', 'yet', 'hardly', 'offensive', 'forgivable', 'film', 'still', 'place', 'heart', 'matter', 'how', 'disappointed', 'am', 'adult']",N/A

I thought it sounded like the kid was an activist who got up a lot of people to shout ""Free Willy!"" until the authorities gave in. I couldn't be more wrong.Jesse (Jason James Richter) is a street-wise kid who was abandoned to child welfare services when he was a toddler. One wild night with his street friends, he breaks into a marine amusement park and spray-paints all over the lower observation windows on one of the tanks. The one that contains Willy, the orca (so-called killer whale).Jesse is assigned to a foster family who insist that he carry out his assigned punishment of cleaning up the paint. In doing so, he makes friends with Willy. And possibly even more important, with Randolph Johnson (August Schellenberg), the native American who is his supervisor at the aquarium. Randolph not only understands the boy, he understands the special bond Jesse has with Willy. He tells Jesse about his tribe's relationship to the Orcas in their history, and gives him a book of native stories.But Willy is not happy. He won't learn any tricks, and is cranky with the primary trainer, Rae Lindley (Lori Petty). When Rae and Randolph notice that Willy likes Jesse and is willing to do tricks to please him, they decide to try to work up a show starring the two as a way to convince the penny-pinching owner of the park to pay for a larger tank for Willy.Things go very wrong, but I'm not going to spoil it by telling you any more, except that of course Willy is eventually freed.An important sub-plot is Jesse's relationship to his foster-parents, Annie and Glen Greenwood (Jayne Atkinson and Michael Madsen). They are nice enough people, but Jesse has a hard time trusting anyone, which is no surprise given his history. But they come through when Jesse (which is to say Willy) really needs them, and I expect the sequel to include their adopting Jesse.As you can see from the stars, I loved this movie, and not just because I love animals and little kids, although that certainly helped",5,Modern Folk Hero is a Whale,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,2076,"['Here', 'one', 'avoided', 'long', 'time', 'mostly', 'unfortunate', 'title', 'thought', 'sounded', 'kid', 'was', 'activist', 'who', 'got', 'up', 'lot', 'people', 'shout', 'Free', 'Willy', 'authorities', 'gave', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'wrong.Jesse', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'street-wise', 'kid', 'who', 'was', 'abandoned', 'child', 'welfare', 'services', 'when', 'was', 'toddler', 'One', 'wild', 'night', 'street', 'friends', 'marine', 'amusement', 'park', 'spray-paints', 'lower', 'observation', 'windows', 'one', 'tanks', 'one', 'Willy', 'orca', 'so-called', 'killer', 'whale', '.Jesse', 'assigned', 'foster', 'family', 'who', 'insist', 'out', 'assigned', 'punishment', 'cleaning', 'up', 'paint', 'doing', 'so', 'friends', 'Willy', 'possibly', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'Randolph', 'Johnson', 'August', 'Schellenberg', 'native', 'American', 'who', 'supervisor', 'aquarium', 'Randolph', 'not', 'only', 'boy', 'special', 'bond', 'Jesse', 'Willy', 'Jesse', 'tribe', 'relationship', 'Orcas', 'history', 'book', 'native', 'stories.But', 'Willy', 'not', 'happy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'learn', 'tricks', 'cranky', 'primary', 'trainer', 'Rae', 'Lindley', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'When', 'Rae', 'Randolph', 'notice', 'Willy', 'Jesse', 'willing', 'do', 'tricks', 'please', 'decide', 'try', 'work', 'up', 'show', 'starring', 'two', 'way', 'convince', 'penny-pinching', 'owner', 'park', 'pay', 'larger', 'tank', 'Willy.Things', 'go', 'very', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'telling', 'more', 'course', 'Willy', 'eventually', 'freed.An', 'important', 'sub-plot', 'Jesse', 'relationship', 'foster-parents', 'Annie', 'Glen', 'Greenwood', 'Jayne', 'Atkinson', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'are', 'nice', 'enough', 'people', 'Jesse', 'hard', 'time', 'trusting', 'anyone', 'surprise', 'given', 'history', 'come', 'when', 'Jesse', 'say', 'Willy', 'really', 'expect', 'sequel', 'include', 'adopting', 'Jesse.As', 'can', 'see', 'stars', 'loved', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'love', 'animals', 'little', 'kids', 'certainly', 'helped']",N/A

Now, you see, under normal circumstances I am, by and large, an action-film man, and, even if we disregard my career aspirations as a marine biologist, can someone possibly put forward a negative comment regarding this film? Because I can't.The premise is as follows, so if you don't want to know the story, skip this paragraph:  Jason James Richter plays the role of Jesse, a down and out street kid, dumped by his mom six years earlier. Convinced of her return he socially attacks his new foster parents (excellent casting on both accounts by Simon Wincer)in a difficult situation which you find difficult to either sympathise or disregard with. However, following a spate of vandalism at a theme park and aquarium, Jesse is ordered to do community service, cleaning the place up. What a drag eh? That is, until he discovers Willy and befriends him, teaching him all sorts of new games and developing a friendship which, up to now in his life, has been completely absent. Oh, by the way, in case you hadn't guessed, Willy happens to be an 8 tonne Killer Whale held captive and seperated from his family by the park. After understanding Willy and his desire to reach his family again, Jesse embarks on a suspense-laden climax to the film in an effort to &quot;Free Willy&quot; from the park and the scheming owner, out to, literally, make a killing on Willy.I have to say, of all the movies I have ever seen (the number probably stands around 1200), this one has the best screenplay and story of the lot (rivalled, perhaps, only by The Sting, starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman). The character interaction (and in this case this is no easy feat) is faultless. Willy and Jesse emerge as the two characters who seem to actually understand the world and how it works, and in time Jesse learns to trust his trying foster parents, much to the delight of the audience.Quite simply, you're a fool if you don't see this. If any additional evidence were needed for this film's awesome cinematic contribution, it lies in the performances of Randolph, Lori Petty, and Starship Trooper's Mr. Radcheck, who plays the nasty, money-grabbing park owner. All are some of the most intriguing and distinguishable characters around in the pantheons of film archives.Finally, then, the last comment would have to be of all the movies ever made, I think it is possible to select about 20 or 30 super-significant films which turned/changed/altered the way the world looks at and appreciate films. You all know what I'm talking about. Examples would include Star Wars, which set the standard for sci-fi fantasy movies, and is still one of the best around; Jaws, which practically defined the thriller genre; Toy Story, which revolutionised computer generated films (with some help from the muche older, but often overlooked, Tron); and Goldfinger, which is classic Bond at its best. Without question, this is one such movie, defining the family/adventure genre.Buy it, watch it, celebrate it and exhalt it (I'll just about forgive you if you don't worship it). One of the most original and touching stories in recent times - a boy befriending an orca whale! Oh, and the score by Basil Poledouris and Michael Jackson is, of course, nothing less than perfect (the &quot;Main Title&quot; piece is particularly stirring). Priceless.",5,Will You Be There?

Telling the story of friendship and freedom, `Free Willy' opens with a young Orca whale (Keiko) being singled out and captured by a group of `bad' men.  The next scene shows our young star Jesse (Jason James Richter) also being captured, this time by police officers.  These two unlikely friends are both placed in `captivity', Willy at the local theme park and Jesse in a foster home where he's instructed to clean up the graffiti he and a friend sprayed on Willy's observation tank.Newcomer Jason James Richter does an okay job as the hellion Jesse, a young boy whose mother abandoned him, but he overworks his bad boy image a little too much at times and comes off forced...but I feel that's a bit harsh to say since the kids so young...but then again so wasn't Haley Joel Osment and he killed in `The Sixth Sense'.  Regardless of the somewhat bad acting at times, the film is redeemed every time Keiko is on the screen.  Willy is truly the star of the show.As Jesse learns to find faith and hope in Willy his relationships with those around him begins to strengthen, but it's not until Willy needs everyone's help that they all realize how much they need each other.  There are some good supporting performances, most recognizable would be `Kill Bill's' very own Michael Madsen who plays Glen Greenwood, the husband half of the couple who wish to adopt Jesse.  Jayne Atkinson does a fine job as Glen's wife Annie, and August Schellenberg and Lori Petty serve well as the two trainers who take Jesse under their wing.  This is truly a film that the entire family can enjoy, one that everyone can watch again and again.  `Free Willy' will always be a memorable childhood memory for me.",4,Wonderful family enterainment!!!,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",2006,1781,"['Free', 'Willy', 'will', 'stand', 'tests', 'time', 'probably', 'time', 'favorite', 'children', 'movie', 'Telling', 'story', 'friendship', 'freedom', 'Free', 'Willy', 'opens', 'young', 'Orca', 'whale', 'Keiko', 'being', 'singled', 'out', 'captured', 'group', 'bad', 'men', 'next', 'scene', 'young', 'star', 'Jesse', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'also', 'being', 'captured', 'time', 'police', 'officers', 'two', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'are', 'placed', 'captivity', 'Willy', 'local', 'theme', 'park', 'Jesse', 'foster', 'home', 'where', 'instructed', 'clean', 'up', 'graffiti', 'friend', 'sprayed', 'Willy', 'observation', 'tank.Newcomer', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'okay', 'job', 'hellion', 'Jesse', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'abandoned', 'bad', 'boy', 'image', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'times', 'off', 'forced', 'feel', 'bit', 'harsh', 'say', 'kids', 'so', 'young', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'killed', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Regardless', 'somewhat', 'bad', 'acting', 'times', 'film', 'redeemed', 'time', 'Keiko', 'screen', 'Willy', 'truly', 'star', 'show.As', 'Jesse', 'find', 'faith', 'hope', 'Willy', 'relationships', 'strengthen', 'not', 'Willy', 'everyone', 'help', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'need', 'other', 'are', 'good', 'supporting', 'performances', 'most', 'recognizable', 'would', 'be', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'very', 'own', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'who', 'Glen', 'Greenwood', 'husband', 'half', 'couple', 'who', 'wish', 'adopt', 'Jesse', 'Jayne', 'Atkinson', 'fine', 'job', 'Glen', 'wife', 'Annie', 'August', 'Schellenberg', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'serve', 'well', 'two', 'trainers', 'who', 'take', 'Jesse', 'wing', 'truly', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'one', 'everyone', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'Free', 'Willy', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'memorable', 'childhood', 'memory']",N/A

87452,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0790719029,D. Litton,"[8, 8]","Whales are a source of constant wonderment and awe for millions of people all over the world, which is what makes &quot;Free Willy&quot; such an awesome flick. The movie chronicles the friendship and tribulation of a boy and a 7,000-pound orca whale, instantly winning over our hearts with its family oriented entertainment. The characters are a division of the likeable and the despised, with a story that pits man against nature and proves to be a race for survival.Jesse is a troubled preteen boy who, after caught by the police for spray-painting graffiti at a waterpark, is taken to live with Glen and Annie Greenwood, who welcome him despite his detached attitude. Forced to clean up the mess he's made, he soon finds himself fascinated by the mere presence of the park's giant orca, Willy, and the two quickly become friends. Jesse is the only one Willy will respond to, which makes the whale's greedy owner ecstatic, as well as surprising the park's owner, Randolph, and the trainer, Ray.The owner soon makes plans to put Willy in the spotlight, which draws a large and noisy crowd, giving Willy a severe case of stage fright and causing the show to fail. Since Willy brings in no revenue, the owner capitalizes on the fact that Willy is worth $1 million in insurance money, and plots to have him killed. At this point, the movie becomes a race against time as Jesse, Randolph, Ray, Glen and Annie struggle to take Willy back to his natural habitat.First and foremost, what makes this movie a big success is the animal character, Willy, which, with the exception of scenes in which Jesse comes into actual contact with him, is a real whale named Keiko. The whale performs some amazing stunts that are not new to anyone who's paid a visit to Sea World, but certainly have not lost their luster. Animals can be trained to do lots of things, and the movie proves that no matter how many times you watch some of these stunts, they still prove to be awe-inspiring even later.I found that it was not so much the stunts the mammal performed that intrigued me as much as it was the increasingly connective bond between Willy and Jesse. Perhaps it is the circumstances which bring them together that is what cements their friendship: in the beginning, Willy is taken from a family of whales out in the ocean, who pay visits to him while he is captive. Jesse is also an orphan, abandoned by his mother as a young boy. Their backgrounds give good reason for their understanding of one another, which is not merely a fable of fiction.The movie's appeal is furthered through its deeper meanings and themes, which are simple enough for children to understand. Jesse and Willy's friendship tells a powerful message about the bonds and the circumstances that shape them, and the resolve of the characters to save him in the end proves that human strength overcomes any situation, perilous or no. This simplicity will appeal to the younger and older sets without compromising its standards as a family film.The cast interacts well with one another, and heading up the ensemble is Jason James Richter as Jesse, who plays the troubled teen syndrome to perfection. His change from mischievous to good-natured is convincing because of his friendship with the whale as well as the acting. August Schellenberg plays Randolph, the park owner with an Indian background. Glen is played by Michael Madsen, who plays him as stern and unrelenting in trying times. This provides a bit of angst between he and Jesse, which is interesting to watch. Ray is played by Lori Petty, and Annie is played by Jayne Atkinson, who is gentle and kind in the role.&quot;Free Willy&quot; is solid family entertainment that delivers a power-punch story for children and adult enjoyment. The whale alone is enough to watch the film for, while the story never fails in delivering one good performance and twist after another.

His antics keep his social worker and foster family worried and busy. He runs away, begs for spare change, steals food and spray paints graffiti on walls. His foster parents really love and care for him but Jesse resists them, believing that his mother will someday return.Jesse's life takes a turn for the better when he encounters Willy, a giant orca, at a marine park nearby. Jesse's fascination with the whale leads to an emotional bond based, at least in part, on their similar circumstances. Willy misses his mother and, like Jesse, tends to 'act out' once in a while.I saw &quot;Free Willy&quot; in 1993 when it was released in theatres. I remembered agreeing with the critics who praised it as great family entertainment and I'm happy to say that the film remains very effective today.My niece (age 8) was thoroughly entertained by this movie but the younger children in the group were alienated by the somewhat advanced, dramatic themes of abandonment, responsibility and love. For what it's worth, I enjoyed the film immensely.Over a decade since its release, &quot;Free Willy&quot; holds up quite well. I got &quot;misty&quot; and &quot;choked up&quot; throughout the desperate climactic rescue sequence that gives the movie its name. The opening sequence, during which Willy is captured, is also quite touching.This is efficient storytelling offering a steady, sustained buildup to a thoroughly satisfying climax.&quot;Free Willy&quot; also offers believable performances by all members of its small ensemble cast, including Michael Madsen, Michael Ironside, Lori Petty, Jason James Richter (as Jesse) and Keiko (as Willy).",5,"Classic Family Entertainment (Good For The Grownups, Too)",1078444800,"03 5, 2004",2004,1712,"['Young', 'Jesse', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'early', 'age', 'troubled', 'kid', 'antics', 'keep', 'social', 'worker', 'foster', 'family', 'worried', 'busy', 'away', 'begs', 'spare', 'change', 'steals', 'food', 'spray', 'paints', 'graffiti', 'walls', 'foster', 'parents', 'really', 'love', 'care', 'Jesse', 'believing', 'mother', 'will', 'someday', 'return.Jesse', 'life', 'turn', 'better', 'when', 'Willy', 'giant', 'orca', 'marine', 'park', 'nearby', 'Jesse', 'fascination', 'whale', 'emotional', 'bond', 'based', 'least', 'part', 'similar', 'circumstances', 'Willy', 'mother', 'Jesse', ""'act"", 'out', 'once', 'while.I', 'saw', 'quot', 'Free', 'Willy', 'quot', '1993', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theatres', 'remembered', 'agreeing', 'critics', 'who', 'praised', 'great', 'family', 'entertainment', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'today.My', 'niece', 'age', '8', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'entertained', 'movie', 'younger', 'children', 'group', 'were', 'alienated', 'somewhat', 'advanced', 'dramatic', 'themes', 'abandonment', 'responsibility', 'love', 'what', 'worth', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely.Over', 'decade', 'release', 'quot', 'Free', 'Willy', 'quot', 'quite', 'well', 'got', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'choked', 'up', 'quot', 'desperate', 'climactic', 'rescue', 'sequence', 'movie', 'name', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Willy', 'captured', 'also', 'quite', 'touching.This', 'efficient', 'storytelling', 'offering', 'steady', 'sustained', 'buildup', 'thoroughly', 'satisfying', 'climax.', 'quot', 'Free', 'Willy', 'quot', 'also', 'believable', 'performances', 'members', 'small', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'including', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Lori', 'Petty', 'Jason', 'James', 'Richter', 'Jesse', 'Keiko', 'Willy']",N/A

My inclination was to think that it was going to be sappy. I mean, how many movies have we seen about a boy and a dog, a boy and a horse and whatnot all? But, a boy and a whale? But, you know, it was a good movie. Excellent!Some of the photography was outstanding and I'm speaking here of watching Orcas (Killer Whales) in the wild. Excellent! Such scenes occurred both at the beginning and at the ending of the movie. In between was more conventional and I have no complaint. The story began with the capture of Willy, the name for the whale. He was then confined to a too-small tank and became unpredictable and failed to perform as intended, much to his owners distress. The owner, I might add viewed the world and everything in it in terms of the dollar value. Into this situation we have a small bunch of juvenile delinquent boys who damaged the water park and one was sentenced to clean up the mess he had left. The boy, almost accidentally, befriended Willy and Willy, in turn, saved him from a drowning accident. They became friends to where the boy could train him to do tricks, but the whale failed to preform in front of a large audience, to the dismay of the owner and others. As such, Willy's life was in danger when an intentional ""accident"" resulted in the draining of Willy's tank. The boy, his parents, and others rushed to save Willy and to free him back to the wild at the same time. They succeeded.It's a good story and well done. Perhaps you might have a box of tissues nearby, just in case, when you view it. The acting was reasonably good. The story lacked credibility here and there, but you'll probably be forgiving. It's an uplifting, feel-good movie that the whole family might enjoy. It might change your mind about having captive animals in zoos and theme parks.Gary Peterson",5,"An Uplifting, Feel-Good Movie For the Whole Family.",1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,1892,"['bargain-rack', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'Free', 'Willy', 'picked', 'up', 'Ross', 'Store', 'inclination', 'was', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'sappy', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'seen', 'boy', 'dog', 'boy', 'horse', 'whatnot', 'boy', 'whale', 'know', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'Excellent', 'photography', 'was', 'outstanding', ""'m"", 'speaking', 'here', 'watching', 'Orcas', 'Killer', 'Whales', 'wild', 'Excellent', 'Such', 'scenes', 'occurred', 'beginning', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'more', 'conventional', 'have', 'complaint', 'story', 'began', 'capture', 'Willy', 'name', 'whale', 'was', 'then', 'confined', 'too-small', 'tank', 'became', 'unpredictable', 'failed', 'perform', 'intended', 'much', 'owners', 'distress', 'owner', 'might', 'add', 'viewed', 'world', 'everything', 'terms', 'dollar', 'value', 'situation', 'have', 'small', 'bunch', 'juvenile', 'delinquent', 'boys', 'who', 'damaged', 'water', 'park', 'one', 'was', 'sentenced', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'had', 'left', 'boy', 'almost', 'accidentally', 'befriended', 'Willy', 'Willy', 'turn', 'saved', 'drowning', 'accident', 'became', 'friends', 'where', 'boy', 'could', 'train', 'do', 'tricks', 'whale', 'failed', 'preform', 'front', 'large', 'audience', 'dismay', 'owner', 'others', 'such', 'Willy', 'life', 'was', 'danger', 'when', 'intentional', 'accident', 'resulted', 'draining', 'Willy', 'tank', 'boy', 'parents', 'others', 'rushed', 'save', 'Willy', 'free', 'back', 'wild', 'same', 'time', 'succeeded.It', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'done', 'Perhaps', 'might', 'have', 'box', 'tissues', 'nearby', 'just', 'case', 'when', 'view', 'acting', 'was', 'reasonably', 'good', 'story', 'lacked', 'credibility', 'here', 'there', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'forgiving', 'uplifting', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'might', 'enjoy', 'might', 'change', 'mind', 'having', 'captive', 'animals', 'zoos', 'theme', 'parks.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

A fantastic rousing adventure that the entire family would enjoy. A young boy, Jesse, is placed in a foster home, after getting into trouble with his friends at a aquatic park. Jesse's punishment is to return to the park to clean it up. While doing so, he meets a new friend, who becomes his best friend, Willy the orca whale. Jesse and Willy bond, and both have one thing in common, a desire to find their family. No one understands Willy better than Jesse, and Willy only sees Jesse. When Jesse discovers that bad guys want Willy dead to collect the insurance money, Jesse comes up with a plan to free Willy. There are very touching moments that make you cry, and there are moments of laugh-out-loud fun. The intriguing story has you hooked as soon as Jesse meets Willy, and the story gets more exciting as the movie continues. Willy saved Jesse's life in the beginning, and at the end, Jesse saves Willy's life. There is an emotional bonding not only between Willy and Jesse, but also Jesse with his foster parents. This is the ideal family movie that not only teaches important morals and values, but the entertainment is explosive.

I'm an orca fan who lives in Kansas, a place where marine life is all but completely nonexistent, so I enjoyed all the footage of the wild orcas swimming free in the ocean and Jessie's friendship with Willy. Storywise, this was a great movie. The only problem I have with it is the ending, which I'm afraid gives some people the wrong ideas about setting captive orcas free. Releasing Willy to the ocean was a fine idea in and of itself, but I feel that it could have been portrayed much better.The end of this movie, while heartwarming, was very unrealistic. Willy has apparently been in captivity long enough to be accustomed to being hand-fed and perform tricks on command, yet upon his release, his instantly bonds with other wild orcas and the next two movies show him living as if he'd never been in captivity. This is far from the truth for most captive-raised whales and dolphins. Rehabilitation is a lengthy and expensive process with no guarantee that an animal will survive in the wild. Keiko, the real Willy, has been in Iceland for five years now and still is dependant on humans for food and companionship.Other than this, it was a great film.

87478,A1LDIMQISH07WK,0790719029,Rebecca,"[6, 6]","Anyone who didn't like this film probably doesn't know the film's true meaning and message. This film is about freedom and forever-lasting friendship between two very unique characters who hardly have anything in common. FREE WILLY gives the message that everyone should be free -- something that every human, animal, and plant on this earth feel even if we cannot express it openly. It also gives the message that even if you don't think you have something in common with someone, you can still be friends with that person -- or animal for that matter -- even if you are very different.FREE WILLY captures the heart and soul of a young 12-year-old orphan boy and his beloved 7,000 pound Orca [Killer] Whale, Willy, who is also an orphan. The story is solid and amazing. The setting of the Pacific Northwest is brilliant. The acting is surpurb by the entire essemble cast, especially Jason James Ritcher, who gives an outstanding performance as Jesse, the young boy who befriends Willy. FREE WILLY is basically about Jesse, who at the beginning of the movie, is a struggling, troubled kid who lives on the streets. His mother left him years ago, and he's always hoping his mother would come back for him. He hangs out with a regular street-gang of kids, who steal to get food and money. When the gang splits up as being chased by the cops, Jesse and his best friend hide out in Willy's labratory tank. They find some paint cans in the workshop and decide to &quot;decorate&quot; the place by spray painting the entire labratory. The cops find the two boys in the labratory. Jesse's friend escapes, but Jesse is caught and arrested. Jesse is punished by one of the cops: He must live with a couple who wants to adopt him and clean up the mess he and his friend made in the labratory. Jesse reluclenty agrees to this plan, and goes to live with the friendly couple and cleans up the mess. Jesse eventually meets Willy and they instantly become attached to each other, especially after Willy saves Jesse's life when he falls into his tank by accident. The owner of the labratory claims that Willy isn't trying to be friendly -- Willy is probably the most unfriendly animal they have at the labratory. But when the man who sponsers the labratory wants to destroy Willy's tank in hopes that they will get a high insurance rate, Jesse must find a way to save his friend and put him back into the ocean with his family.FREE WILLY is a very charming, heartwarming tale. The theme song by Michael Jackson, &quot;Will You Be There&quot; is an excellent addition for the movie. A movie not to be missed by anybody. This film is followed-up by two, just as amazing and solid squels: FREE WILLY 2: THE ADVENTURE HOME and FREE WILLY 3: THE RESCUE, which I also recommend.",5,FREE WILLY -- the greatest friendship film of all time.,984873600,"03 18, 2001",2001,2757,"['Anyone', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'probably', ""n't"", 'know', 'film', 'true', 'meaning', 'message', 'film', 'freedom', 'forever-lasting', 'friendship', 'two', 'very', 'unique', 'characters', 'who', 'hardly', 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'FREE', 'WILLY', 'message', 'everyone', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'something', 'human', 'animal', 'plant', 'earth', 'feel', 'even', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'openly', 'also', 'message', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'something', 'common', 'someone', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'friends', 'person', 'animal', 'matter', 'even', 'are', 'very', 'different.FREE', 'WILLY', 'heart', 'soul', 'young', '12-year-old', 'orphan', 'boy', 'beloved', '7,000', 'pound', 'Orca', '[', 'Killer', ']', 'Whale', 'Willy', 'who', 'also', 'orphan', 'story', 'solid', 'amazing', 'setting', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'surpurb', 'entire', 'essemble', 'cast', 'especially', 'Jason', 'James', 'Ritcher', 'who', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Jesse', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'Willy', 'FREE', 'WILLY', 'basically', 'Jesse', 'who', 'beginning', 'movie', 'struggling', 'troubled', 'kid', 'who', 'streets', 'mother', 'left', 'years', 'ago', 'always', 'hoping', 'mother', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'out', 'regular', 'street-gang', 'kids', 'who', 'steal', 'get', 'food', 'money', 'When', 'gang', 'up', 'being', 'chased', 'cops', 'Jesse', 'best', 'friend', 'hide', 'Willy', 'labratory', 'tank', 'find', 'paint', 'cans', 'workshop', 'decide', 'quot', 'decorate', 'quot', 'place', 'spray', 'painting', 'entire', 'labratory', 'cops', 'find', 'two', 'boys', 'labratory', 'Jesse', 'friend', 'Jesse', 'caught', 'arrested', 'Jesse', 'punished', 'one', 'cops', 'must', 'live', 'couple', 'who', 'adopt', 'clean', 'up', 'mess', 'friend', 'made', 'labratory', 'Jesse', 'reluclenty', 'plan', 'live', 'friendly', 'couple', 'up', 'mess', 'Jesse', 'eventually', 'Willy', 'instantly', 'become', 'attached', 'other', 'especially', 'Willy', 'Jesse', 'life', 'when', 'tank', 'accident', 'owner', 'labratory', 'Willy', ""n't"", 'trying', 'be', 'friendly', 'Willy', 'probably', 'most', 'unfriendly', 'animal', 'have', 'labratory', 'when', 'man', 'who', 'labratory', 'destroy', 'Willy', 'tank', 'hopes', 'will', 'get', 'high', 'insurance', 'rate', 'Jesse', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'save', 'friend', 'put', 'back', 'ocean', 'family.FREE', 'WILLY', 'very', 'charming', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'theme', 'song', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'quot', 'Will', 'Be', 'quot', 'excellent', 'addition', 'movie', 'movie', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'anybody', 'film', 'followed-up', 'two', 'just', 'amazing', 'solid', 'squels', 'FREE', 'WILLY', '2', 'ADVENTURE', 'HOME', 'FREE', 'WILLY', '3', 'RESCUE', 'also', 'recommend']",N/A
87479,A281NPSIMI1C2R,0790719029,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[22, 22]","The reason this film is so moving is because it is about freedom. We all value freedom and the human spirit longs to be free. Animals are born to run free, on the earth or in the sea. The thought of trapping a whale in a tank just large enough for dolphins seems rather cruel. So, we cheer on, as a 12-year-old spunky street kid makes freeing this beautiful Orca whale possible.Jesse is the star of this movie and is at first a troubled kid who keeps thinking his mother will come back to take him home. Willy is the whale who was also taken from his family, so the two find common ground. When Willy saves Jesse's life, they form a bond of friendship and Jesse is the only one who can train the whale. The owner of the Pacific Northwest Aquatic Park plots to get insurance money by destroying the tank and when Jesse hears of the plans he has to race against time to save his friend.The scenes of the Pacific Northwest are spectacular and the whales playfully dancing in the water is a pure display of joy. These are truly on of God's most magnificent creations. Keiko, a 7,000-pound Orca is the whale star, but they also have back-up from a full-sized ""animatronic"" whale. I could not tell the difference between the whales, it was that good.One of the best parts of the film is when Jesse spends his pocket money to buy the whale his favorite treat, salmon. I just thought that showed Jesse's true character. While he acts tough on the outside, he seems to be fascinated with nature and animals and that brings out his more loving side.Throughout the movie, the theme of family is very important and I think that might be why this film is such a favorite. There is a music video at the beginning of this video and there is also information for children about helping save whales from becoming extinct. Overall, I felt this was a great movie for children and adults and it teaches such great lessons: that we all need a family and that we should respect animals. I was captivated from beginning to end. A wonderful movie for all ages.~The Rebecca Review",5,Freedom,984009600,"03 8, 2001",2001,2055,"['reason', 'film', 'so', 'moving', 'freedom', 'value', 'freedom', 'human', 'spirit', 'longs', 'be', 'free', 'Animals', 'are', 'born', 'run', 'free', 'earth', 'sea', 'thought', 'trapping', 'whale', 'tank', 'just', 'large', 'enough', 'dolphins', 'rather', 'cruel', 'So', 'cheer', '12-year-old', 'spunky', 'street', 'kid', 'freeing', 'beautiful', 'Orca', 'whale', 'possible.Jesse', 'star', 'movie', 'first', 'troubled', 'kid', 'who', 'thinking', 'mother', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'take', 'home', 'Willy', 'whale', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'taken', 'family', 'two', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'When', 'Willy', 'Jesse', 'life', 'form', 'bond', 'friendship', 'Jesse', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'train', 'whale', 'owner', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Aquatic', 'Park', 'plots', 'get', 'insurance', 'money', 'destroying', 'tank', 'when', 'Jesse', 'plans', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'friend.The', 'scenes', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'are', 'spectacular', 'whales', 'playfully', 'dancing', 'water', 'pure', 'display', 'joy', 'are', 'truly', 'God', 'most', 'magnificent', 'creations', 'Keiko', '7,000-pound', 'Orca', 'whale', 'star', 'also', 'have', 'back-up', 'full-sized', 'animatronic', 'whale', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'difference', 'whales', 'was', 'good.One', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'when', 'Jesse', 'pocket', 'money', 'buy', 'whale', 'favorite', 'treat', 'salmon', 'just', 'thought', 'showed', 'Jesse', 'true', 'character', 'tough', 'outside', 'be', 'fascinated', 'nature', 'animals', 'out', 'more', 'loving', 'movie', 'theme', 'family', 'very', 'important', 'think', 'might', 'be', 'why', 'film', 'favorite', 'music', 'video', 'beginning', 'video', 'also', 'information', 'children', 'helping', 'save', 'whales', 'becoming', 'extinct', 'Overall', 'felt', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'children', 'adults', 'such', 'great', 'lessons', 'need', 'family', 'should', 'respect', 'animals', 'was', 'captivated', 'beginning', 'end', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'ages.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A
