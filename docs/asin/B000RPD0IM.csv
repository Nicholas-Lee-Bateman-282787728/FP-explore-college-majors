Unfortunately, there was far more in the way of interviews than I wanted.  It's great for what it is, but I really wanted more game footage.  The length of the program on each DVD was also shorter than I hoped, considering each DVD covers an entire season.  That's why I was left wanting more game footage.  It's hard to show much in an hour for an entire season per DVD.  They could have put the entire thing on 2 DVDs.",4,Great if you like interviews!,1209600000,"05 1, 2008",2008,499,"['purchased', '5', 'DVD', 'set', 'hopes', 'getting', 'lots', 'lots', 'game', 'footage', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'way', 'interviews', 'wanted', 'great', 'what', 'really', 'wanted', 'more', 'game', 'footage', 'length', 'program', 'DVD', 'was', 'also', 'shorter', 'hoped', 'considering', 'DVD', 'entire', 'season', 'why', 'was', 'left', 'wanting', 'more', 'game', 'footage', 'hard', 'show', 'much', 'hour', 'entire', 'season', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'entire', 'thing', '2', 'DVDs']",NFL: America's Game: Dallas Cowboys

Each season has plenty to offer in highlights & interviews. As a fan you always want more, butt these were laid out in the same style. The only complaint is that you wish it had more, butt that's how these were all made.

It's equally interesting to see why Jimmy Johnson called it quits, thus entering the Barry Switzer years. I never realized the pressure put on Barry Switzer to coach the Cowboys to a &#34;three-peat.&#34; The player perspective on the Jimmy Johnson / Jerry Jones bouts, along with the contrasting personality of Barry Switzer is quite interesting. This is a great package with an attractive price. Get it.
