226204,A2GOTTK868X1CR,6300247228,Albert Lee,"[9, 83]","By the time this film was made, liberalism was running on emptyand running up against truth in the form of Ronald Reagan.  Afterselling America on the virtues of drugs, being a prostitute orbeing a bum.  After selling America that religion was evil, thatthe government was evil and that our own institutions were theenemy, this was the end of the line.  The last message theliberals had for was this:  Empty the prisons and let thecriminals go free.  Thankfully for the survival of America,the people stepped back from the pit at that point and the evilhold liberals had on the country was done.The film starts with Robert Redford, the new warden, pretendingto be a convict so he can understand the system from the inside.He finds out that prison isn't a very nice place.  But as aliberal, he decides thats the fault of everyone but thepeople in jail for crimes.After he reveals himself as warden, he declares war on theentire prison system.  Everyone who works for him (guards,trustees, etc) is the enemy.  He then proceeds to start to turnthe prison over to the good government of the prisonersthemselves.  The prison becomes an anarchist commune.But just as the prison is turning into a worker's socialistparadise, the evil guards and their political friends fightback.  So in a despirate gamble to save himself, the wardensends the inmates out to dig up a graveyard.  The film thegoes over the top straying from any portion of the real storyit was loosely based on and the man who told the warden aboutthe graveyard is murdered.Redford then totally loses it and we get a big baby-boomerblow-up about how the system is oppressing him and how workingwithin the system can't really change anything.  I really halfexpected to see him return to the prison at that point andmarry one of the inmates.  Or to organize a mass uprisingagainst the guards.  But he just lets off steam against hisliberal friends who have traded their revolutionary idealsfor power within the system.This film is better as a showcase of what went wrong whenthe liberals took power in the 1970's and went on the rampage.Those liberals who were strictly in it for money or power turnedon the true revolutionaries (like Redford) as quick as theycould.  The true revoltionaries who wanted to wave the redflag over the entire government could not run a coffee shoplet along big institutions like prisons.  They alienatedthe people who did the work to a point where they had to leave.The revolution from above failed and they were driven off intowhatever gutters in the big cities would have them.",1,One of the last gasps of ultra-liberal socialist hollywood,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,2565,"['time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'liberalism', 'was', 'running', 'emptyand', 'running', 'up', 'truth', 'form', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Afterselling', 'America', 'virtues', 'drugs', 'being', 'prostitute', 'orbeing', 'bum', 'selling', 'America', 'religion', 'was', 'evil', 'thatthe', 'government', 'was', 'evil', 'own', 'institutions', 'were', 'theenemy', 'was', 'end', 'line', 'last', 'message', 'theliberals', 'had', 'was', 'Empty', 'prisons', 'let', 'thecriminals', 'go', 'free', 'Thankfully', 'survival', 'America', 'people', 'stepped', 'back', 'pit', 'point', 'evilhold', 'liberals', 'had', 'country', 'was', 'done.The', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'new', 'warden', 'pretendingto', 'be', 'convict', 'can', 'understand', 'system', 'inside.He', 'out', 'prison', ""n't"", 'very', 'nice', 'place', 'aliberal', 'fault', 'everyone', 'thepeople', 'jail', 'crimes.After', 'warden', 'war', 'theentire', 'prison', 'system', 'Everyone', 'who', 'guards', 'trustees', 'etc', 'enemy', 'then', 'start', 'turnthe', 'prison', 'good', 'government', 'prisonersthemselves', 'prison', 'anarchist', 'commune.But', 'just', 'prison', 'turning', 'worker', 'socialistparadise', 'evil', 'guards', 'political', 'friends', 'fightback', 'So', 'despirate', 'gamble', 'save', 'wardensends', 'inmates', 'out', 'dig', 'up', 'graveyard', 'film', 'thegoes', 'top', 'straying', 'portion', 'real', 'storyit', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'man', 'who', 'told', 'warden', 'aboutthe', 'graveyard', 'murdered.Redford', 'then', 'totally', 'get', 'big', 'baby-boomerblow-up', 'how', 'system', 'oppressing', 'how', 'workingwithin', 'system', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'change', 'anything', 'really', 'halfexpected', 'see', 'return', 'prison', 'point', 'andmarry', 'one', 'inmates', 'organize', 'mass', 'guards', 'just', 'off', 'steam', 'hisliberal', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'traded', 'revolutionary', 'idealsfor', 'power', 'system.This', 'film', 'better', 'showcase', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'whenthe', 'liberals', 'took', 'power', '1970', 'went', 'rampage.Those', 'liberals', 'who', 'were', 'strictly', 'money', 'power', 'true', 'revolutionaries', 'Redford', 'as', 'quick', 'theycould', 'true', 'revoltionaries', 'who', 'wanted', 'wave', 'redflag', 'entire', 'government', 'could', 'not', 'run', 'coffee', 'shoplet', 'big', 'institutions', 'prisons', 'alienatedthe', 'people', 'who', 'did', 'work', 'point', 'where', 'had', 'leave.The', 'revolution', 'failed', 'were', 'driven', 'off', 'intowhatever', 'gutters', 'big', 'cities', 'would', 'have']",N/A

I really enjoyed it and was saddened to hear that Brubaker was fired because he stood up for something that everyone else was afraid to, or didn't want to admit the corrupt system in that southern prison. The conditions I saw reminds me of the prisons in the dark ages and how 'disgusting' the living conditions were. It blew me away that those men had to live in terrible conditions at this day in age. I almost don't want to think about prisons that are in that very condition (probably worse) throughout the world.

226207,A3C54XWT93R2WY,6300247228,"Been around this block, several times over","[2, 3]","Life runs a precarious balance between the idea of leadership and the idea of democracy.  Democracy goes to the yearning for peace-- for ""why can't we all just get along.""  It is a vision of one great moment of one-for-all-and-all-for-one united splash of TEAMWORK.  But, like it or not, teams organize around a sense of unity against some verion of ""the COMMON enemy.""  In health and human services, that ""common"" enemy soon turns out to be the client.  In fact, research by sociologist Blau discovered just that.  When service teams become closely bonded together, guess who gets left out?  Why, it's the client!!!  People easily bond together to form a ""common"" union with those whose interests at that moment are closest to one's own-- I mean, that's the American way!  Rhetoric and theory then emerge to fog that fact, to hide the crass selfishness behind thick clouds of spin and pretension. The violence that such a situation can give rise to is quite invisible . . . unless, that is, one has actually been there at a moment when s/he was sufficiently prepared to actually see it (which can be quite a crap shoot).Of course, no one is prepared for the casual innocence with which such all-devouring dynamics take place.  Prejudices and corruption are thus soon entrenched with generation after generation of highly trained and very ""morally"" committed workers getting their turn at bat.  Perhaps we can call the outcome some looking-down-the-nose name like ""bureaucracy"" . . . or structural mediocracy . . . whatever!!!  The point is that all is soon lost in everyone most ""democratically"" getting his or hers.Like sand through the fingers, no one ever seems subsequently capable of getting enough of a handle on the matter to do something about it.  Pretty soon all gruesome work directed at the victims of the process-- the malfactors against which that ""team spirit"" arose-- becoming completely invisible . . . except, of course, when clients are seen as THE PROBLEM.Alas, just as ""the system"" must have its victims, so must change.  In the case of change, the fall guy is usually someone who embodies the very highest ideals that the system proclaims for itself.  S/he is the person who somehow didn't get the memo that ""we were only talking"" at that last 4th of July celebration!  That person takes on the fight, but s/he can only do so because s/he accepts the privations that go with it.In the TERMINATOR series, the younger futuristic hero takes up the fight against robots. How convenient!  Who would not root for a leader who calls us to stand up to machines?  But when the maldoers are one's uncle, one's professor, one's boss, one's spouse-- now that's a horse of a different color.  So it become possible for billions to be poured into our middle eastern wars for the supposed ""good of the people,"" and it all gets lost in annonymous pockets.  Haiti has an earthquake, and . . . guess what . . . there nothing in the kitty with which to help anybody out.  ""The problem, Horatio, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.""Unquestionably, the ""enemy"" in prisons is the prisoners.  So anything staff do to them . . . well, they've brought it on themselves.  Particularly if the guy doing this sort of torture by deprivation of the cons wears a broad grin and bings you a nice apple pie from his wife.  Like the man said, ""Why can't we all just get along?""  Never mind that these guys will eventually get out, and this time they're more ""mad as hell"" (and vindicated in the idea that's it's OK for them to be the way they are because the whole world is that way) than ever before.Brubaker is about leadership taking personal responsibility, doing something, and then demondtrating that genuine motives and talent can get presumably impossible results.  However, interestingly enough, that's when the leader's trouble are just beginning.  Incompetence we can tolerate-- it doesn't make the rest us feel uncomfortable, it doesn't challenge our creature comforts-- but competence that makes a difference upsets everything (especially the corrupting plant growing in my own back yard).  Hence, systems, even if radically altered, have a way of ultimately reconstituting themselves.In all good drama, the hero who railes against the night, ultimately undergoes apotheosis.  In tragic drama as in real life, that means he dies (or gets fired) and then his soul is lifted up to heaven.  That is to say, the big grin and apple pie from the missus win over policy, and we all just go back to scandelous unregulated business and bonuses for all the guys who got us there (the near depression) in the first place.  Our president and his army of ""good old boys"" economic advisors clearly don't want to go to heaven, so they will punt, and grunt, and mouth a whole lot of things that will eventuall get us back to that pig through of same old. same old.The movie BRUBAKER is about the personal cost of effective leadership.  Of course, at the very end, the highly siccessful ex-warden is seen in a limo on his way to heavan.  The sendoff they give him in the process just tickles your hopefulness and brings a tear to your eye.  But the really important voice in that scene is that of the new warden barking the rules for return to ""the old ways"" in the background.So, my advice? See it, for it says more about the realities of the leadership we so crave occasionally in this country-- at least during those histrical moments when ""just getting along"" has finally gotten us in an imposisble fix.  It will tell you why there are so few who actually step up to the plate and take a swing at the really high-velocity curve balls.  The movie is disturbing because it draws us into the harsh reality of the dynamic I have been trying to tell you about.  I can't tell you about it as well as the movie does-- it alows you to actually FEEL these dynamics-- but that's probably why I have survived (just barely) in the moribund American health and human service bureaucracy.  If I spoke with the aclarity of the movie, then I would long have been in heaven by now.  Yes, Virginia, it will definitely educate you about reality without Santa!Of course, you have to see the movie and decide for yourself.  My only intent is to let you know that the price it depicts being exacted from true leadership is really what happens-- as it was in the case of the real-life warden it is based upon.  Profesionally, I teach and practice the running of health and human services systems, and the first thing I start with is the distinction between ""management"" and ""leadrship.""  This outstanding film will allow you not only to see it, but to experience it in the pit of you stomach, and marrow of your bones as well.  Good luck making your own decision about this work of art.  All I ask is that you then write your own review so I can return and learn about how others see it.",5,"There are movies, and then there's life.",1263340800,"01 13, 2010",2010,6856,"['Life',

226208,A2H80RTEIALU4Q,6300247228,Beth Harmon,"[0, 0]","The names have changed but it is based on a real man (changed for the film) who became warden of one of the most brutal prison farms in the country and tried his best impose real prison reform....but is stopped at every turn by the prison board who believed more in profit in slave labor rather than see and treat prison inmates as human beings.Brubaker arrives at the prison undercover at first, posing as an inmate so he can see first hand the cruelty and barbaric treatment of the inmates at the hands of brutal trustees. Once Brubaker reveals himself to be the new warden, he vows that there will be no more cruel and unusual punishment while at the same time insisting that the inmates will have to prove themselves if they want respect from him.Brubaker does win over quite a few of the prisoners, but the trustees, one of whom has grave doubts about Brubaker's purpose, and another who profited from the prison farm's previous regime, are not too keen on him, especially the latter who profited in lots of ways from the previous regime of the former and ineffectual warden.Brubaker steps on many toes in his efforts to make Wakefield (the name of the prison) a more effectual and humane prison. He cancels a contract with an old timer who used the inmates for slave labors for his factory. He burns down the love shacks, infuriating the trustee who used to lord over his power over the other inmates. He fires other prison employees for their unethical practices as well. But the act that really got the prison board on his back was digging up graves, thanks to the info from an old timer (who is brutally murdered for this) in the field, the graves of inmates who died from the brutal policies in past times at Wakefield. This last act ultimately gets Brubaker fired.Brubaker loses his job, but he does gain the respect of ALL the inmates in the end (including the African-American trustee who didn't trust him at first).(SPOILERS). It's sad watching Brubaker being driven away from the prison knowing that in no time at all all the process he made in the prison will be undone and the place will most likely go back to being the way it was before he came there....brutality will once again be the norm and the inmates will be at the mercy of the trustees. However it is gratifying reading at the end that a couple of years later the inmates sued the prison officials and the courts ordered it closed.This really is a great prison movie....it doesn't so much focus on the inmates as it does on the warden (a rarity in prison films) who just wanted to make a difference but has to deal with opposition from the prison board who don't hold to his idealistic and humane ideals. Robert Redford gives the performance of his career in here in my opinion and the supporting cast that includes Jane Alexander, David Keith, and Yaphet Kotto are equally good.Most underrated film that's worth watching.",5,Powerful story of a man who tried to make a difference.,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",2014,2900,"['names', 'have', 'changed', 'based', 'real', 'man', 'changed', 'film', 'who', 'became', 'warden', 'one', 'most', 'brutal', 'prison', 'farms', 'country', 'tried', 'best', 'impose', 'real', 'prison', 'reform', '.but', 'stopped', 'turn', 'prison', 'board', 'who', 'believed', 'more', 'profit', 'slave', 'labor', 'rather', 'see', 'treat', 'prison', 'inmates', 'human', 'beings.Brubaker', 'prison', 'undercover', 'first', 'posing', 'inmate', 'can', 'see', 'first', 'hand', 'cruelty', 'barbaric', 'treatment', 'inmates', 'hands', 'brutal', 'trustees', 'Once', 'Brubaker', 'be', 'new', 'warden', 'will', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'cruel', 'unusual', 'punishment', 'same', 'time', 'insisting', 'inmates', 'will', 'have', 'prove', 'want', 'respect', 'him.Brubaker', 'win', 'quite', 'few', 'prisoners', 'trustees', 'one', 'whom', 'grave', 'doubts', 'Brubaker', 'purpose', 'who', 'profited', 'prison', 'farm', 'previous', 'regime', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'especially', 'latter', 'who', 'profited', 'lots', 'ways', 'previous', 'regime', 'former', 'ineffectual', 'warden.Brubaker', 'steps', 'many', 'toes', 'efforts', 'make', 'Wakefield', 'name', 'prison', 'more', 'effectual', 'humane', 'prison', 'contract', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'used', 'inmates', 'slave', 'labors', 'factory', 'down', 'love', 'shacks', 'infuriating', 'trustee', 'who', 'used', 'lord', 'power', 'other', 'inmates', 'other', 'prison', 'employees', 'unethical', 'practices', 'as', 'well', 'act', 'really', 'got', 'prison', 'board', 'back', 'was', 'digging', 'up', 'graves', 'thanks', 'info', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'field', 'graves', 'inmates', 'who', 'died', 'brutal', 'policies', 'past', 'times', 'Wakefield', 'last', 'act', 'ultimately', 'Brubaker', 'fired.Brubaker', 'job', 'gain', 'respect', 'inmates', 'end', 'including', 'African-American', 'trustee', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'trust', 'first', 'SPOILERS', 'sad', 'watching', 'Brubaker', 'being', 'driven', 'away', 'prison', 'knowing', 'time', 'process', 'made', 'prison', 'will', 'be', 'undone', 'place', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'go', 'back', 'being', 'way', 'was', 'came', 'there', '.brutality', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'be', 'norm', 'inmates', 'will', 'be', 'mercy', 'trustees', 'However', 'gratifying', 'reading', 'end', 'couple', 'years', 'later', 'inmates', 'sued', 'prison', 'officials', 'courts', 'ordered', 'really', 'great', 'prison', 'movie', '.it', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'focus', 'inmates', 'warden', 'rarity', 'prison', 'films', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'make', 'difference', 'deal', 'opposition', 'prison', 'board', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'idealistic', 'humane', 'ideals', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'performance', 'career', 'here', 'opinion', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'David', 'Keith', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'are', 'equally', 'good.Most', 'underrated', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

My wife asked me the other day if I had replaced my VHS of this with the DVD. I realized I hadn't and I was long overdo to see this again. I immediately ordered it. The movie is one of Redford's best so fans of his should definitely see it. If you aren't a fan, then see it because it is a good drama about what sometimes occurs in prisons whether those that work in that environment like it or not.

226211,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,6300247228,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[6, 7]","I have always had a soft spot for the 1980 film ""Brubaker."" This earnest work, detailing horrible conditions in a Southern prison, stars Robert Redford in fine superstar form as liberal warden Henry Brubaker attempting to reform the conditions of a penal system suffering from decades of neglect. ""Brubaker,"" in many ways, is the end of a glorious 1970's era of Redford's career. He would soon become a director (""Ordinary People"" in 1980), and would work only sporadically as an actor for the next 10 years, evolving into the older roles we see today.Redford's character mysteriously arrives on the scene as a quiet inmate, witnessing a variety of shocking injustices including torture, rape, maggot-infested food and murder. After 30 minutes of grime (which evidently takes place over several days), he steps forward, revealing himself to be the new prison warden.Based on an actual case which took place in Arkansas during the 1960s, ""Brubaker,"" to its discredit, takes quiet a few liberties for dramatic effect. I have always wondered how Redford's character escaped unscathed during his brief inmate tenure. And when he finally makes his proclamation, he takes a huge risk by walking into the warden's office adorned in nothing more than soiled prisoner scrubs. This is not the way it happened, and while this device allows the viewer to witness primitive prison conditions first-hand, it creates an uneven film.Brubaker has his work cut out for him. He essentially rolls up his sleeves, hires a new doctor, plants crops and has fresh food available for the inmates. This is all well and good until he must make an appearance at a prison board meeting (at the local Hilton) and answer the inevitable questions as to why improvements are even necessary. With selfish abandon, he alienates the board and decides to go to war against their corruption.""Brubaker"" boasts one of the finest supporting casts you are likely ever going to see. Yaphet Kotto, David Keith, Murray Hamilton, Jane Alexander, Tim McIntire, Matt Clark, Everett McGill, M. Emmet Walsh, Albert Salmi, Val Avery, Richard Ward (in his final role) and with an early performance by a singing Morgan Freeman to boot! Such expert casting raises the level of ""Brubaker"" several notches, and Kotto, as cynical inmate trustee Richard 'Dickie' Coombes, just about steals the film. Interestingly, he sees the futility of Brubaker's quest. He announces to him at one point, ""You're going to get people killed!""Stuart Rosenberg directed this film, and a token glance at his resume reveals the fine prison drama ""Cool Hand Luke"" in 1967. Reportedly Bob Rafelson ('Five Easy Pieces"") was originally on board, and one wonders what his vision might have been. Abrupt changes in directors never help a production, and ""Brubaker"" suffers from an overall lack of character development. Rarely is there a scene of personal contemplation. We know very little about Brubaker's life, with the exception that he eats TV dinners and falls asleep on the couch. Redford's star persona is supposed to fill in the gaps, but it weakens the film's quality.By the conclusion, Brubaker has discovered some unmarked prisoner graves, though his source is murdered in a very sad scene. Politicians wish this secret to be kept quiet, giving Brubaker negotiating power to receive the funds necessary to fulfill his reformation. His refusal to compromise seems short-sighted and egotistical. Men get killed, he gets rightfully fired, and by film's end the prison is returning to traditional ways.There is really no way to have a happy ending for this story, though less formula would have better served its message. I couldn't help but recall the brilliant 1995 film ""Dead Man Walking."" It too was a cry for prisoner rights, but told from the viewpoint of multi-dimensional characters with disturbing flaws and anguish. ""Brubaker"" has the same message, 15 years before, though with contrivances injected to enhance traditional Hollywood flow.",3,An earnest work,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,3973,"['have', 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', '1980', 'film', 'Brubaker', 'earnest', 'work', 'detailing', 'horrible', 'conditions', 'Southern', 'prison', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'fine', 'superstar', 'form', 'liberal', 'warden', 'Henry', 'Brubaker', 'attempting', 'reform', 'conditions', 'penal', 'system', 'suffering', 'decades', 'neglect', 'Brubaker', 'many', 'ways', 'end', 'glorious', '1970', 'era', 'Redford', 'career', 'would', 'soon', 'become', 'director', 'Ordinary', 'People', '1980', 'would', 'work', 'only', 'sporadically', 'actor', 'next', '10', 'years', 'evolving', 'older', 'roles', 'see', 'character', 'mysteriously', 'scene', 'quiet', 'inmate', 'witnessing', 'variety', 'shocking', 'injustices', 'including', 'torture', 'rape', 'maggot-infested', 'food', 'murder', '30', 'minutes', 'grime', 'evidently', 'place', 'several', 'days', 'forward', 'revealing', 'be', 'new', 'prison', 'warden.Based', 'actual', 'case', 'took', 'place', 'Arkansas', '1960s', 'Brubaker', 'discredit', 'quiet', 'few', 'liberties', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'how', 'Redford', 'character', 'escaped', 'unscathed', 'brief', 'inmate', 'tenure', 'when', 'finally', 'proclamation', 'huge', 'risk', 'walking', 'warden', 'office', 'adorned', 'nothing', 'more', 'soiled', 'prisoner', 'scrubs', 'not', 'way', 'happened', 'device', 'viewer', 'witness', 'primitive', 'prison', 'conditions', 'first-hand', 'uneven', 'film.Brubaker', 'work', 'cut', 'out', 'essentially', 'up', 'sleeves', 'new', 'doctor', 'plants', 'crops', 'fresh', 'food', 'available', 'inmates', 'well', 'good', 'must', 'make', 'appearance', 'prison', 'board', 'meeting', 'local', 'Hilton', 'answer', 'inevitable', 'questions', 'why', 'improvements', 'are', 'even', 'necessary', 'selfish', 'abandon', 'board', 'decides', 'go', 'war', 'corruption', 'Brubaker', 'one', 'finest', 'supporting', 'casts', 'are', 'likely', 'ever', 'going', 'see', 'Yaphet', 'Kotto', 'David', 'Keith', 'Murray', 'Hamilton', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Tim', 'McIntire', 'Matt', 'Clark', 'Everett', 'McGill', 'M.', 'Emmet', 'Walsh', 'Albert', 'Salmi', 'Val', 'Avery', 'Richard', 'Ward', 'final', 'role', 'early', 'performance', 'singing', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'boot', 'Such', 'expert', 'casting', 'level', 'Brubaker', 'several', 'notches', 'Kotto', 'cynical', 'inmate', 'trustee', 'Richard', ""'Dickie"", 'Coombes', 'just', 'steals', 'film', 'Interestingly', 'futility', 'Brubaker', 'quest', 'one', 'point', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'people', 'killed', 'Stuart', 'Rosenberg', 'directed', 'film', 'token', 'glance', 'resume', 'fine', 'prison', 'drama', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', '1967', 'Reportedly', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', ""'Five"", 'Easy', 'Pieces', 'was', 'originally', 'board', 'one', 'what', 'vision', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Abrupt', 'changes', 'directors', 'never', 'help', 'production', 'Brubaker', 'suffers', 'overall', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'Rarely', 'scene', 'personal', 'contemplation', 'know', 'very', 'little', 'Brubaker', 'life', 'exception', 'TV', 'dinners', 'asleep', 'couch', 'Redford', 'star', 'persona', 'supposed', 'fill', 'gaps', 'film', 'quality.By', 'conclusion', 'Brubaker', 'discovered', 'unmarked', 'prisoner', 'graves', 'source', 'murdered', 'very', 'sad', 'scene', 'Politicians', 'wish', 'secret', 'be', 'kept', 'quiet', 'giving', 'Brubaker', 'negotiating', 'power', 'receive', 'funds', 'necessary', 'fulfill', 'reformation', 'refusal', 'compromise', 'short-sighted', 'egotistical', 'Men', 'get', 'killed', 'rightfully', 'fired', 'film', 'end', 'prison', 'returning', 'traditional', 'ways.There', 'really', 'way', 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'story', 'less', 'formula', 'would', 'have', 'better', 'served', 'message', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'recall', 'brilliant', '1995', 'film', 'Dead', 'Man', 'Walking', 'too', 'was', 'cry', 'prisoner', 'rights', 'told', 'viewpoint', 'multi-dimensional', 'characters', 'disturbing', 'flaws', 'anguish', 'Brubaker', 'same', 'message', '15', 'years', 'before', 'contrivances', 'injected', 'enhance', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'flow']",N/A

The interest is in the fact that the new boss of the prison gets inside the prison as an inmate, unknown of everyone in the prison. So we get a first part that depicts, from inside, all the unethical dealings and purely criminal acts from the prison guards as well as from the inmates. Simple prisoners are the victims of all kinds of violence from the trustees, from the bullies and they have to buy their way through this permanent ordeal even from the doctor who sells his medical assistance, not to speak of the slave labor the prison  provides to local contractors or businesses, entrepreneurs in a word that may turn into undertakers, and even the finagling and embezzling and trafficking of the prison guards with the food and anything that can be taken, legally or illegally, from the prisoners and sold at a price. The second part is the first dealings of the new boss with the problem and we discover even more scandalous crimes from inside the administration including the systematic torturing and killing of resisting inmates. The third part deals with the reaction of the prison board, the senator, the governor, and other officials when they learn what is happening, i.e. the attempt to open up the various chapters of this book of torture and killing. And then we discover some more embezzling and the will to cover it all up. They will eventually fire that resisting warden. We also discover in this third part that prison reformers are ready to accept any compromise, i.e. to cover up the crimes of all officials provided they get some investment for the prison, provided the truncheons get gilded points. The last scene is the emotional departure of the fired warden and a last written statement on what happened afterwards showing or proving the story was a true story. Of course the point of view of the inmates themselves is not explored, but the film is very effective about prison reform and what the minimum has to be: to give back to the inmates all their human rights lest they may go to court to fight for them, which is slightly romantic for us to believe that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Hpw can we bring prisons back within habeas corpus and human rights,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,2294,"['film', '1980', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'prison', 'reform', 'interest', 'fact', 'new', 'boss', 'prison', 'prison', 'inmate', 'unknown', 'everyone', 'prison', 'get', 'first', 'part', 'unethical', 'dealings', 'purely', 'criminal', 'acts', 'prison', 'guards', 'as', 'well', 'inmates', 'Simple', 'prisoners', 'are', 'victims', 'kinds', 'violence', 'trustees', 'bullies', 'have', 'buy', 'way', 'permanent', 'ordeal', 'even', 'doctor', 'who', 'medical', 'assistance', 'not', 'speak', 'slave', 'labor', 'prison', 'local', 'contractors', 'businesses', 'entrepreneurs', 'word', 'may', 'turn', 'undertakers', 'even', 'finagling', 'embezzling', 'trafficking', 'prison', 'guards', 'food', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'legally', 'illegally', 'prisoners', 'sold', 'price', 'second', 'part', 'first', 'dealings', 'new', 'boss', 'problem', 'discover', 'even', 'more', 'scandalous', 'crimes', 'administration', 'including', 'systematic', 'torturing', 'killing', 'resisting', 'inmates', 'third', 'part', 'deals', 'reaction', 'prison', 'board', 'senator', 'governor', 'other', 'officials', 'when', 'learn', 'what', 'happening', 'i.e', 'attempt', 'open', 'up', 'various', 'chapters', 'book', 'torture', 'killing', 'then', 'discover', 'more', 'embezzling', 'will', 'cover', 'up', 'will', 'eventually', 'fire', 'resisting', 'warden', 'also', 'discover', 'third', 'part', 'prison', 'reformers', 'are', 'ready', 'accept', 'compromise', 'i.e', 'cover', 'up', 'crimes', 'officials', 'provided', 'get', 'investment', 'prison', 'provided', 'truncheons', 'get', 'gilded', 'points', 'last', 'scene', 'emotional', 'departure', 'fired', 'warden', 'last', 'written', 'statement', 'what', 'happened', 'afterwards', 'showing', 'proving', 'story', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'course', 'point', 'view', 'inmates', 'not', 'explored', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'prison', 'reform', 'what', 'minimum', 'be', 'give', 'back', 'inmates', 'human', 'rights', 'lest', 'may', 'go', 'court', 'fight', 'slightly', 'romantic', 'believe', 'that.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

Brubaker hatches the ingenious plan to insert himself into the prison population at Wakefield Penitentiary as an inmate to experience first hand all the problems inside the facility. What he uncovers is nothing less than barbaric punishment methods, no structured management of inmates, lack of medical care, and the penitentiary itself in advance stages of disrepair.Henry Brubaker, after revealing his status as the new warden and assuming his duties, goes on to discover that there are no state hired corrections officers on the staff.  Inmate trustees, armed with weapons, are given the responsibility of manning watch towers, supervising work crews, and keeping the peace inside of the prison.  Furthermore, prisoners are farmed out to local businessmen in the community for work with no pay which amounts to slave labor.Upon deeper investigation into all the activities in and around the prison, Brubaker discovers other illegal activities including theft of prison food supplies and equipment, inmates being charged fees for almost non-existent medical care, and the revelation that there are prisoners buried on the prison property that were the victims of murder by fellow inmates.Brubaker confronts the state prison board with these problems only to find out that the prison board is not only aware of these incidents, they think the system should reamin unchanged because it has always been this way and should remain so.  You can sense their unhappiness with Brubaker as the new warden who wants to come in and upset their system rather than tow the line.Henry Brubaker is portrayed as a man of honesty, integrity, and professionalism and in defying the prison board's message to leave well enough alone, he launches his own campaign to reform the prison and correct the wrongs he has inherited as the new warden. Unfortunately, with the power of the prison board and the governor of the state against him, he is eventually removed as the warden and fired.In the final outcome, many inmates saw the necessity of the changes attempted by Brubaker and were dismayed at seeing him removed and the new warden not making proper progress to reform the prison. This prompted many inmates to file lawsuits against the state for inhumane prison conditions resulting in the governor not being re-elected the following year.This movie is a fine drama with a very good plot, great acting, and poignant conclusion.

226224,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,6300247228,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","I've been readingRobert Redford: The Biographyby Michael Feeney Callan and going back and watching Redford's films again.  The section on ""Brubaker"" reveals much of the production story with Redford arriving on set five days after completing ""The Electric Horseman.""  Bob Rafelson who had created The Monkees was set to direct, but the film was not coming together with casting being incomplete.  Stuart Rosenberg who directed ""Cool Hand Luke"" was called in, shut down production for ten days, and tried to revamp the open-ended script, deciding not to use any of Rafelson's footage.The resulting film is compelling.  It earned an Oscar nomination for screenwriters Richter and Ross.  Redford's character of Henry Brubaker is brooding, exacting with a low threshold of tolerance for dishonesty or stupidity.  I'm impressed with the subtlety and clarity of the resulting performance.  The story centers on prison reform, always a hard ball political issue.  Redford picked projects with some political angle that interested him.  Yes, with society's hardcore criminal class, it is hard to root for them.  But what Brubaker confronts is a system that has become as corrupt as the criminals with graft, influence peddling, and even murder commonplace and covered up.Several of the supporting performances are incredibly good.  Yaphet Kotto as Coombes shows the power of his presence and brings the film's feel-good conclusion to fruition.  He shows himself as a very powerful actor.  David Keith's Larry Lee Bullen is also impressive, an Elivs-style rocker who appears to have been railroaded into a third-strike conviction.  Keith does a fine job in the film.  Murray Hamilton plays the sleazy prison board operator who comes to hate Brubaker and will suffer from Brubaker's attempt to end graft.  Jane Alexander also gives a quality performance as fellow prison reformer Lillian Gray.  Morgan Freeman's cameo as the wild inmate Walter presages his illustrious career.Aside from wherever you stand politically, Brubaker works well as a film and holds up some 30+ years after initial release.  The universal themes that even a convict is a person who should be treated humanely resounds in our era where debates about waterboarding and enhanced interrogation techniques have replaced Brubaker's era of lashes with a leather strap.  The film has a strong point of view, which will cause a strong reaction from friends and foes.  It's an excellent piece of cinema.

226230,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6300247228,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 8]","Robert Redford is Brubaker, an honest expert in corrections sent to clean up a trouble-plagued penitentiary.  Sent to Wakefield Brubaker enters undercover, living his first few days as a prisoner.  We learn that for its brutality, Wakefield was conceived along the lines of a noble experiment - one that gave the prisoners unusual autonomy, and was intended to actually correct those imprisoned there.  Instead, the experiment has carved a super-class of prisoners who rule over the rest of the prisoners as Trustees.  Unafraid to use force, they skim off books while stealing supplies already paid for.  Brubaker, once revealed as the new warden, slowly but surely turns the system upside down - he can't move too quickly because those prisoners or administrators who are most guilty are also the only ones who can tell him what's wrong.  Eventually discarding the old guard, Brubaker soon learns that Wakefield has an even darker secret, one whose discovery threatens the Wakefield's future.This was a good movie, although it's hard to understand the first time around.  The sophisticated system of prisoner autonomy is somewhat hard to believe unless you've already seen the movie before.  The setting is interesting - a dessicated prison, complete with an antique electric chair (which emerges from the shadows like the monster from ""Alien"" - quite yet terrifying).  That said, the movie has no surprises (comparisons to ""Last Castle"" are incorrect).  Brubaker is an utterly honest and incorruptible soul.  Once we see how he uncovers grafters among the prison administration and trustees, there's little more for him to do.  We know that outside businessmen will be corrupt croneys and that even well meaning corrections bureaucrats will try to rein Brubaker in for the good of the system.  The movie blows what should be its focus - having Brubaker connect with the prisoners - something he does too easily, too much so considering that his first speech reminds them that they are prisoners and that they are there for a reason.  There also aren't enough really supportive roles - as if Yaphet Kotto was the only reliable prisoner.
