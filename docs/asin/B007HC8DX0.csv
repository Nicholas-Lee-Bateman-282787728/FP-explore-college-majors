I tend not to re-write the film summary in my reviews, because that can readily be viewed.There's little to smile about in this tragic film of a family and an individual (Kawa) broken apart by his coming to terms with his sexuality. The story is moving, the cast strong, the acting and direction all very good to excellent.  The emotional family scene towards the end was a bit stretched in my mind, and really the key difference between 4 and 5 stars.The scenery and landscapes are breath-taking - and the colorful cinematic effects also reminded me of Far From Heaven which employed a kaleidoscope of brilliant colors.  If you looking for a heavy film about family and coming out at a late age in life, I definitely recommend Kawa (and the accompanying soundtrack).",4,Well Acted and Somewhat Depressing Story with Beautiful Landscapes,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",2013,862,"['Kawa', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'modern', 'day', 'obviously', 'foreign', 'version', 'ofFar', 'Heaven', 'tend', 'not', 're-write', 'film', 'summary', 'reviews', 'can', 'readily', 'be', 'little', 'smile', 'about', 'tragic', 'film', 'family', 'individual', 'Kawa', 'broken', 'apart', 'coming', 'terms', 'sexuality', 'story', 'moving', 'cast', 'strong', 'acting', 'direction', 'very', 'good', 'excellent', 'emotional', 'family', 'scene', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'stretched', 'mind', 'really', 'key', 'difference', '4', '5', 'stars.The', 'scenery', 'landscapes', 'are', 'breath-taking', 'colorful', 'cinematic', 'effects', 'also', 'reminded', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'employed', 'kaleidoscope', 'brilliant', 'colors', 'looking', 'heavy', 'film', 'family', 'coming', 'out', 'late', 'age', 'life', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'Kawa', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack']",Kawa

I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.

But I must point out something.The main character at one point exclaims, ""I can't be Maori and gay!""  Many gays and lesbians of color feel this way and I understand why the line was important.  However, plenty of books say that Polynesia was not a homophobic region before Western contact.  The Wikipedia entry on gay rights in New Zealand said the pre-contact Maori did not punish same-sex sexual activity.  In Hawaii, it's been written that Kamehameha the Great had female and male lovers.  Polynesia had ""third genders.""  I read one book which said Gaughin painted them in Tahiti.  Some say in Samoa if parents had all sons they could assign one son to be the daughter.  When my very homophobic Black uncle visited Samoa, the locals pointed out a transgender person in the village.  They knew my uncle would be shocked and possibly revolted, but they themselves were not opposed.  Recently, an academic friend said she's met many gay and lesbian Polynesians on her recent trip to Tahiti.So I encourage all viewers of this to read books and sources that said Polynesia used to be a friendly place for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgenders until Westerners demanded that they be bigoted.",2,A Disclaimer on the Pacific,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",2012,1320,"['film', 'typical', 'coming-out', 'narrative', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Lost', 'Language', 'Cranes', 'Making', 'Love', 'must', 'point', 'out', 'something.The', 'main', 'character', 'one', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'Maori', 'gay', 'Many', 'gays', 'lesbians', 'color', 'feel', 'way', 'understand', 'why', 'line', 'was', 'important', 'However', 'plenty', 'books', 'say', 'Polynesia', 'was', 'not', 'homophobic', 'region', 'Western', 'contact', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 'gay', 'rights', 'New', 'Zealand', 'said', 'pre-contact', 'Maori', 'did', 'not', 'punish', 'same-sex', 'sexual', 'activity', 'Hawaii', 'been', 'written', 'Kamehameha', 'Great', 'had', 'female', 'male', 'lovers', 'Polynesia', 'had', 'third', 'genders', 'read', 'one', 'book', 'said', 'Gaughin', 'painted', 'Tahiti', 'say', 'Samoa', 'parents', 'had', 'sons', 'could', 'assign', 'one', 'son', 'be', 'daughter', 'When', 'very', 'homophobic', 'Black', 'uncle', 'visited', 'Samoa', 'locals', 'pointed', 'out', 'transgender', 'person', 'village', 'knew', 'uncle', 'would', 'be', 'shocked', 'possibly', 'revolted', 'were', 'not', 'opposed', 'Recently', 'academic', 'friend', 'said', 'met', 'many', 'gay', 'lesbian', 'Polynesians', 'recent', 'trip', 'Tahiti.So', 'encourage', 'viewers', 'read', 'books', 'sources', 'said', 'Polynesia', 'used', 'be', 'friendly', 'place', 'gay', 'men', 'lesbians', 'bisexuals', 'transgenders', 'Westerners', 'demanded', 'be', 'bigoted']",Kawa

1530724,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B007HC8DX0,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[5, 8]","...Woman's Point of View...and involving much of a woman's sensitivity.And yet the movie we're given is from a story written by a man, Witi Ihimaera. A man well known for an acclaimed, later literary work (and film), ""The Whale Rider"" (world premiere at the 2002, Toronto International Film Festival). Still, this is an author who seems to possess much of the ""sensitivity"" referred to above. In truth, female touches abound, which should be no surprise inasmuch as this film work was steered by Director Katie Wolfe, aided by the screenplay work of Kate McDermott. So, in essence, this work is almost as much the story of our Gay lead, Kawa's ....Wife....his Mother....his Daughter, as it is of the man, himself.BUT, woman's point of view or not, the Pain....the Angst....revealed to us in Calvin Tuteao's characterization of Kawa is REAL. For at its heart this is a story of a man from whom much is, and has been, expected by his Maori societal group....and family. We see a Gay man who has, in fact, led a heterosexual married life (with children). Nevertheless, what we are shown in Kawa is a man experiencing a severe case of ""Closetophobia"".....and a near disabling Fear of Disapproval.Yes, there is a male lover (on the side)....and visits to a bathhouse. BUT for those anticipating finding more than mere hints of Gay romance or Gay love scenes in this work, I must reluctantly say such hopes will be dashed. The emphasis seems to be, instead, upon heterosexual closeness....family closeness. And fear of loss of the latter.Oh, there is a ""final stand"" taken against family...and society, and that is effectively conveyed to we viewers. But I will reveal nothing more about this film's closing storyline. I can say, however, that production values were unexpectedly high, from this film goer's point of view. And gorgeous New Zealand scenery doesn't hurt at all (rating credit was given for all this).I have yet to decide whether to keep this video in my Gay Film Library.",4,Almost....almost as if seen from a,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",2012,1980,"['Woman', 'Point', 'View', 'involving', 'much', 'woman', 'sensitivity.And', 'yet', 'movie', ""'re"", 'given', 'story', 'written', 'man', 'Witi', 'Ihimaera', 'man', 'well', 'known', 'acclaimed', 'later', 'literary', 'work', 'film', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'world', 'premiere', '2002', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Still', 'author', 'who', 'possess', 'much', 'sensitivity', 'referred', 'above', 'truth', 'female', 'touches', 'abound', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'inasmuch', 'film', 'work', 'was', 'steered', 'Director', 'Katie', 'Wolfe', 'aided', 'screenplay', 'work', 'Kate', 'McDermott', 'So', 'essence', 'work', 'almost', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'Gay', 'lead', 'Kawa', '.Wife', 'Mother', '.his', 'Daughter', 'man', 'himself.BUT', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'Pain', '.the', 'Angst', '.revealed', 'Calvin', 'Tuteao', 'characterization', 'Kawa', 'REAL', 'heart', 'story', 'man', 'whom', 'much', 'been', 'expected', 'Maori', 'societal', 'group', '.and', 'family', 'see', 'Gay', 'man', 'who', 'fact', 'led', 'heterosexual', 'married', 'life', 'children', 'Nevertheless', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'Kawa', 'man', 'experiencing', 'severe', 'case', 'Closetophobia', '..and', 'near', 'disabling', 'Fear', 'Disapproval.Yes', 'male', 'lover', 'side', '.and', 'visits', 'bathhouse', 'BUT', 'anticipating', 'finding', 'more', 'mere', 'hints', 'Gay', 'romance', 'Gay', 'love', 'scenes', 'work', 'must', 'reluctantly', 'say', 'such', 'hopes', 'will', 'be', 'dashed', 'emphasis', 'be', 'instead', 'heterosexual', 'closeness', '.family', 'closeness', 'fear', 'loss', 'latter.Oh', 'final', 'stand', 'taken', 'family', 'society', 'effectively', 'conveyed', 'viewers', 'will', 'reveal', 'nothing', 'more', 'film', 'closing', 'storyline', 'can', 'say', 'however', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'unexpectedly', 'high', 'film', 'goer', 'point', 'view', 'gorgeous', 'New', 'Zealand', 'scenery', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'rating', 'credit', 'was', 'given', 'have', 'yet', 'decide', 'keep', 'video', 'Gay', 'Film', 'Library']",Kawa

1530732,A2SE9F3RBSJQEH,B007HC8DX0,Thierry,"[1, 8]","The production values, beautiful settings, and glimpses into the Maori culture are a real plus in this new film from the director of The Whale Rider. The actors in the film are very attractive and articulate, and there are several stories going on at once in the film. The retirement of the father from a very respected position in business, the interests of both the daughter and son in the family as they grow up within their family, and the dysfunctional marriage of the lead actors, brought on by the husband's struggle with his homosexuality.When the husband declares to his family that he's gay, most everyone in the family is surprised, shocked, angry, hurt, and generally disgusted by his announcement and have a very hard time dealing with his disclosure. It's difficult to know how his kids feel, because this aspect of the story is not discussed. It would especially have been interesting to see how his teenage son deals with it. He is trying so hard to be the macho kid he is expected to be in the culture, but is still vulnerable enough to be unsure of himself.While I know this sounds moralistic (judgmental), I think he should have chosen not to disclose his sexual orientation until his children had grown up and were on their own.His parents told him that he was being very selfish with his decision to come out. I agree. A person can lead only so many lifes during a lifetime and he had made a choice that he should have honored. When his kids had grown up and he wanted to divorce, that would have been the time.The style is the movie is very over dramatic. I understand that they were trying to express through drama, music, distressed looks, the seriousness of the subject. But the movie plays out like an episode of Days of our Lives. It was also difficult to see the lead character as gay. He appeared to be an introverted macho, hetro man with issues, and probably would not be happy as a gay man, anyway.If the definition of a film is to make you think, not just entertain you, then this film is one to see. It brings up issues of loyalty, culture, identity, love and courage.
