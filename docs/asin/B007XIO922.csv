1539691,AWWTBOXKPLNSM,B007XIO922,dlrife1965,"[1, 2]","This independent film showed a lot of potential, and was a lot of fun to watch. I'd like to see any sequels, if they work as well and have as engaging a story line (and characters). Four stars for some technical issues blending CGI with live action, as well as some halting acting from the characters.I know that this was a movie, so I can say it is easy to suspend belief in what is termed &#34;main stream science&#34;, and not have to say that the sci-fantasy aspects had issues. This means: I am not going to pick apart the movie based on what is colloquially known as &#34;science&#34;. I also really appreciated the underlying theme to the movie, elucidated quite well by the villain. Perhaps this theme will be better fleshed in sequels.The acting had its moments, and the interaction between the main character and his sidekick robot was actually pretty good. Hopefully the scriptwriting and acting will only get better in any possible future sequels, as indicated at the end of the movie.The movie had all the right stuff for a nerd-become-hero: robot sidekick, nervous love interest, extra-dimensional villian, symbiotic DNA changes, some comedic moments, as well as some very honest attempts at suspense. The CGI was fairly good, but still somewhat &#34;plastic&#34; in its rendering. That could use some work.Overall, the blending of CGI and live acting was good, although there were points that could have been smoother. I would have liked to see some more development of the symbiotic relationship, but perhaps that will come in the future.Still, for an independent film, this was very enjoyable, and I could definitely see that it would reach a large audience if given the chance. Perhaps it will spawn some other ideas from other independent film makers and they could turn the film franchise into something far more accesible to the common person.In any case, thumbs up, (two), and I await the (if there are any) sequel(s).",4,"Nice independent film, enjoyable, nice underlying message that is very timely.",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,1940,"['independent', 'film', 'showed', 'lot', 'potential', 'was', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'sequels', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'engaging', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'Four', 'stars', 'technical', 'issues', 'blending', 'CGI', 'live', 'action', 'as', 'well', 'halting', 'acting', 'characters.I', 'know', 'was', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'easy', 'suspend', 'belief', 'what', 'termed', '34', 'main', 'stream', 'science', '34', 'not', 'have', 'say', 'sci-fantasy', 'aspects', 'had', 'issues', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'pick', 'apart', 'movie', 'based', 'what', 'colloquially', 'known', '34', 'science', '34', 'also', 'really', 'appreciated', 'underlying', 'theme', 'movie', 'elucidated', 'quite', 'well', 'villain', 'Perhaps', 'theme', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'fleshed', 'sequels.The', 'acting', 'had', 'moments', 'interaction', 'main', 'character', 'sidekick', 'robot', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'Hopefully', 'scriptwriting', 'acting', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'possible', 'future', 'sequels', 'indicated', 'end', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'had', 'right', 'stuff', 'nerd-become-hero', 'robot', 'sidekick', 'nervous', 'love', 'interest', 'extra-dimensional', 'villian', 'symbiotic', 'DNA', 'changes', 'comedic', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'honest', 'attempts', 'suspense', 'CGI', 'was', 'fairly', 'good', 'still', 'somewhat', '34', 'plastic', '34', 'rendering', 'could', 'use', 'work.Overall', 'blending', 'CGI', 'live', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'points', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'smoother', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'development', 'symbiotic', 'relationship', 'perhaps', 'will', 'come', 'future.Still', 'independent', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'could', 'definitely', 'see', 'would', 'reach', 'large', 'audience', 'given', 'chance', 'Perhaps', 'will', 'spawn', 'other', 'ideas', 'other', 'independent', 'film', 'makers', 'could', 'turn', 'film', 'franchise', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'accesible', 'common', 'person.In', 'case', 'thumbs', 'up', 'two', 'await', 'are', 'sequel', 's']",N/A

1539693,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B007XIO922,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Take a smidge of mad science, take a straight-arrow scientist and a colorful, dastardly villain, and here's an origin story to make Stan Lee grin real big. Bespectacled, easily flustered astrophysicist, Dr. Adam Gaines (Christopher Farley), has landed the discovery of a lifetime: a meteorite from which emerges an alien, iron-based parasite of which 27-million-year-old atomic structure predates the creation of the universe. When Dr. Gaines is caught in a lab explosion and suffers tremendous thermal burns, the alien organism attaches itself to his nervous system and grants him superhuman abilities. Since the explosion coincides with a fiendish mastermind's abduction of his lovely scientist friend, Dr. Margo Scott (Jennifer Ferguson), Gaines resorts to the course of action the nerds of the world can rally around: he becomes a superhero.The fedora-sporting, trenchcoat-wearing, frequently smirking big bad is Gremlo Flugg (Colin Armstrong) who'd just taken over all media channels to drop an ultimatum: either the United Nations elect Flugg as ""Supreme Planet Master"" (by 3pm Pacific standard time) or he destroys Earth. Accompanied by his irreverent floating robot, Dr. Gaines activates his symbiotic jetpack and roars to Flugg's Mojave Desert lair for the smackdown showdown.Touted as an ""independent superhero movie,"" is this a rousing one-man labor of love or a who-does-he-think-he-is vanity project? I'm rolling with ""labor of love."" Christopher Farley writes, edits, directs, stars in ATOM NINE ADVENTURES. He's also co-director of photography and is credited with the special effects. Right now he's probably at Walmart hawking DVDs of this movie. Imdb estimates the budget as $20,000, so you have to marvel at the quality of the CG effects onscreen. No, visually, this film can't compete with the A-list superhero cinema. But, man, I relish the moxie and enthusiasm and unexpected charm of this film. It's got the vibrant energy of DARKMAN, a whiff of Indiana Jones, and a stronger whiff of Buck Rogers. ATOM NINE ADVENTURES is part Blue Beetle, part Rocketeer, part Greatest American Hero, and even part Booster Gold (when you consider that the hovering orb JimBot reminds one of Booster's sidekick Skeets). The filmmakers present a tone that balances an earnest homage to superheroes with a droll sense of humor. The acting? Farley and Colin Armstrong ham it up to the hilt, with Farley ratcheting up the square-jawed sincerity and Armstrong just having a devilish good time playing the over-the-top villain. And, for my money, Paul Meade as the voice of Jimbot hijacks all the scenes. Jimbot is simply that endearing.Just several of the things I like about this movie:- That the robot sidekick's internal screen readout designates Dr. Gaines as ""Boss Organism""- That Jimbot tunes out Dr. Gaines whenever the Boss Organism goes into lecture mode- Gremlo Flugg's creepy, astrally projected henchmen, the Fluggmen (reminds me of the Gentlemen from Buffy)- The sheer presposterousness of how Atom Nine steers away the hurtling moon (how many laws of physics did that shatter? Oh, but it was fun!)- Flugg's delivery of pseudo techno-babble; he recites lines like ""Ready super-impulse-magneto-plasmatomic beam."" Or how about ""Then use all remaining liquid hydrogen to stabilize the plasmatomic sphere!""What I don't like:- Atom Nine's costume could use some work- Not enough of Atom Nine in actionI would say stick around for the post-credit stinger but this movie was made in 2007 and it doesn't seem like there'll be a sequel...",4,"""I've got to stop that moon.""",1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,3543,"['Take', 'smidge', 'mad', 'science', 'take', 'straight-arrow', 'scientist', 'colorful', 'dastardly', 'villain', 'here', 'origin', 'story', 'make', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'real', 'big', 'Bespectacled', 'easily', 'flustered', 'astrophysicist', 'Dr.', 'Adam', 'Gaines', 'Christopher', 'Farley', 'landed', 'discovery', 'lifetime', 'meteorite', 'alien', 'iron-based', 'parasite', '27-million-year-old', 'atomic', 'structure', 'creation', 'universe', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Gaines', 'caught', 'lab', 'explosion', 'suffers', 'tremendous', 'thermal', 'burns', 'alien', 'organism', 'nervous', 'system', 'grants', 'superhuman', 'abilities', 'explosion', 'fiendish', 'mastermind', 'abduction', 'lovely', 'scientist', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Margo', 'Scott', 'Jennifer', 'Ferguson', 'Gaines', 'course', 'action', 'nerds', 'world', 'can', 'rally', 'superhero.The', 'fedora-sporting', 'trenchcoat-wearing', 'frequently', 'smirking', 'big', 'bad', 'Gremlo', 'Flugg', 'Colin', 'Armstrong', 'who', ""'d"", 'just', 'taken', 'over', 'media', 'channels', 'drop', 'ultimatum', 'United', 'Nations', 'elect', 'Flugg', 'Supreme', 'Planet', 'Master', '3pm', 'Pacific', 'standard', 'time', 'Earth', 'Accompanied', 'irreverent', 'floating', 'robot', 'Dr.', 'Gaines', 'symbiotic', 'jetpack', 'roars', 'Flugg', 'Mojave', 'Desert', 'lair', 'smackdown', 'showdown.Touted', 'independent', 'superhero', 'movie', 'rousing', 'one-man', 'labor', 'love', 'who-does-he-think-he-is', 'vanity', 'project', ""'m"", 'rolling', 'labor', 'love', 'Christopher', 'Farley', 'edits', 'directs', 'stars', 'ATOM', 'NINE', 'ADVENTURES', 'also', 'co-director', 'photography', 'credited', 'special', 'effects', 'Right', 'now', 'probably', 'Walmart', 'hawking', 'DVDs', 'movie', 'Imdb', 'budget', '20,000', 'so', 'have', 'marvel', 'quality', 'CG', 'effects', 'onscreen', 'No', 'visually', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'A-list', 'superhero', 'cinema', 'man', 'relish', 'moxie', 'enthusiasm', 'unexpected', 'charm', 'film', 'got', 'vibrant', 'energy', 'DARKMAN', 'whiff', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'stronger', 'whiff', 'Buck', 'Rogers', 'ATOM', 'NINE', 'ADVENTURES', 'part', 'Blue', 'Beetle', 'part', 'Rocketeer', 'part', 'Greatest', 'American', 'Hero', 'even', 'part', 'Booster', 'Gold', 'when', 'consider', 'hovering', 'orb', 'JimBot', 'one', 'Booster', 'sidekick', 'Skeets', 'filmmakers', 'present', 'tone', 'earnest', 'homage', 'superheroes', 'droll', 'sense', 'humor', 'acting', 'Farley', 'Colin', 'Armstrong', 'ham', 'hilt', 'Farley', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'square-jawed', 'sincerity', 'Armstrong', 'just', 'having', 'devilish', 'good', 'time', 'playing', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'money', 'Paul', 'Meade', 'voice', 'Jimbot', 'hijacks', 'scenes', 'Jimbot', 'simply', 'endearing.Just', 'several', 'things', 'like', 'movie', 'robot', 'sidekick', 'internal', 'screen', 'readout', 'Dr.', 'Gaines', 'Organism', 'Jimbot', 'out', 'Dr.', 'Gaines', 'whenever', 'Boss', 'Organism', 'lecture', 'mode-', 'Gremlo', 'Flugg', 'creepy', 'astrally', 'projected', 'henchmen', 'Fluggmen', 'Gentlemen', 'Buffy', 'sheer', 'presposterousness', 'how', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'away', 'hurtling', 'moon', 'how', 'many', 'laws', 'physics', 'did', 'shatter', 'Oh', 'was', 'fun', 'Flugg', 'delivery', 'pseudo', 'techno-babble', 'lines', 'Ready', 'super-impulse-magneto-plasmatomic', 'beam', 'how', 'Then', 'use', 'remaining', 'liquid', 'hydrogen', 'stabilize', 'plasmatomic', 'sphere', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'costume', 'could', 'use', 'work-', 'Not', 'enough', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'actionI', 'would', 'say', 'stick', 'post-credit', 'stinger', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2007', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sequel']",N/A

1539696,A2EENVGNDH8N9G,B007XIO922,Mike,"[19, 22]","I like to support independent film makers and low budget films.  Sometimes on rare occasions I come across one that's pretty darn good.  Too often they're laughably bad.  Still I suppose even those can be worth my time for a good laugh.  This film was a rarity, it's VERY good, and a perfect example of what can be done with a small amount of money combined with a large amount of talent.  Big film makers can learn a lesson from films like this one.  What they spend on a making a film is almost obscene.  According to the IMDB the estimated budget on this was $20,000. I'm guessing many films spend more than that much on food catering or perks for the pampered stars. The man responsible for this gem is Christopher Farley.  His name seems to be everywhere in the credits.  He wrote it, he directed it; he did the visual effects, produced it and even played the lead character Atom Nine for crying out loud!  He probably even did other jobs I missed. Even some family members were extras based on the last names.  I'm surprised he didn't write the music too.  And amazingly he did a fine job in every single category.  To sum it up, this is a superhero origin story.  The hero must deal with the usual egotistical super villain out to rule the world.  Adam Nine is sort of a combination of The Blue Beetle (current version), The Rocketeer, and the Man of Steel himself.  Don't get me wrong Atom Nine is an original character. How he gains his powers is a fun ride in itself; I'm just giving a hint at what he's like with those other hero names. There's even a small flying robotic sidekick that's the best I've seen since R2D2, maybe better.  This robot talks and is both humorous and endearing.  I really can't get over how well the effects were done for the cost.  I can only imagine what he would have created with a larger budget, makes me want to invest in his next work.I recommend this film to every comic book and superhero fan out there with an open mind.  An open mind about what they were able to do here with the budget they had.  If I had to make a few  complaints it would be, his costume needs some work and  the way he saves the day at the end was a bit much....but hey if Superman can rotate the entire  world backwards to turn back time, who am I to complain about how this story saves our planet from the moon.  Besides, I'm a sucker for a happy ending where the seemingly nerdy guy gets the girl and all that.  At the end it hinted that there might be a sequel someday.  I really hope that happens. I could write much more praise about this fun action adventure family film, but I like to keep these comments as short as possible. I figure if they're short enough maybe more people might take the time to read them.  This is almost twice my usual words.  I'm now a fan of Mr. Farley and plan to see all his films if I can.  `Atom Nine' was made in 2007; I'm surprised he isn't better known by now.  The man is multi-talented for sure.  I see he has another unrelated film work in production.  I very much look forward to seeing it.  I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because I'm so impressed on what he was able to do with such a small budget.  For that and everything else it deserves an excellent rating.  Note:  I only gave a 5 out of 5 to one or two very famous films so 4 is saying a lot from me.  And no I'm not related to anyone connected with the film!",4,A fine film that's lots of fun !,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,3384,"['like', 'support', 'independent', 'film', 'makers', 'low', 'budget', 'films', 'Sometimes', 'rare', 'occasions', 'come', 'one', 'pretty', 'darn', 'good', 'Too', 'often', ""'re"", 'laughably', 'bad', 'Still', 'suppose', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'worth', 'time', 'good', 'laugh', 'film', 'was', 'rarity', 'VERY', 'good', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'small', 'amount', 'money', 'combined', 'large', 'amount', 'talent', 'Big', 'film', 'makers', 'can', 'learn', 'lesson', 'films', 'one', 'What', 'spend', 'making', 'film', 'almost', 'obscene', 'According', 'IMDB', 'estimated', 'budget', 'was', '20,000', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'many', 'films', 'spend', 'more', 'that', 'much', 'food', 'catering', 'perks', 'pampered', 'stars', 'man', 'responsible', 'gem', 'Christopher', 'Farley', 'name', 'be', 'everywhere', 'credits', 'wrote', 'directed', 'did', 'visual', 'effects', 'produced', 'even', 'played', 'lead', 'character', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'probably', 'even', 'did', 'other', 'jobs', 'missed', 'Even', 'family', 'members', 'were', 'extras', 'based', 'last', 'names', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'music', 'too', 'amazingly', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'single', 'category', 'sum', 'up', 'superhero', 'origin', 'story', 'hero', 'must', 'deal', 'usual', 'egotistical', 'super', 'villain', 'rule', 'world', 'Adam', 'Nine', 'sort', 'combination', 'Blue', 'Beetle', 'current', 'version', 'Rocketeer', 'Man', 'Steel', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'original', 'character', 'How', 'gains', 'powers', 'fun', 'ride', ""'m"", 'just', 'giving', 'hint', 'what', 'other', 'hero', 'names', 'even', 'small', 'flying', 'robotic', 'sidekick', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'R2D2', 'maybe', 'better', 'robot', 'talks', 'humorous', 'endearing', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'how', 'well', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'cost', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'created', 'larger', 'budget', 'want', 'invest', 'next', 'work.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'comic', 'book', 'superhero', 'fan', 'there', 'open', 'mind', 'open', 'mind', 'what', 'were', 'able', 'do', 'here', 'budget', 'had', 'had', 'make', 'few', 'complaints', 'would', 'be', 'costume', 'work', 'way', 'day', 'end', 'was', 'bit', 'much', '.but', 'hey', 'Superman', 'can', 'rotate', 'entire', 'world', 'backwards', 'turn', 'back', 'time', 'who', 'am', 'complain', 'how', 'story', 'planet', 'moon', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'seemingly', 'nerdy', 'guy', 'girl', 'end', 'hinted', 'might', 'be', 'sequel', 'someday', 'really', 'hope', 'could', 'write', 'much', 'more', 'praise', 'fun', 'action', 'adventure', 'family', 'film', 'like', 'keep', 'comments', 'as', 'short', 'possible', 'figure', ""'re"", 'short', 'enough', 'maybe', 'more', 'people', 'might', 'take', 'time', 'read', 'almost', 'twice', 'usual', 'words', ""'m"", 'now', 'fan', 'Mr.', 'Farley', 'plan', 'see', 'films', 'can', 'Atom', 'Nine', 'was', 'made', '2007', ""'m"", 'surprised', ""n't"", 'better', 'known', 'now', 'man', 'multi-talented', 'sure', 'see', 'unrelated', 'film', 'work', 'production', 'very', 'much', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'so', 'impressed', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'small', 'budget', 'everything', 'else', 'excellent', 'rating', 'Note', 'only', 'gave', '5', '5', 'one', 'two', 'very', 'famous', 'films', 'so', '4', 'saying', 'lot', ""'m"", 'not', 'related', 'anyone', 'connected', 'film']",N/A
