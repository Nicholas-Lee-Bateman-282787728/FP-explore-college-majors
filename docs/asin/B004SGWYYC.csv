Finally in May of 2010 it prospered and continued on with honors! I was going around and telling my friends and family about it. Trying to keep the sales strong and luckily it did for the 6th and final season came out in April of 2011. Almost a year after it's 5th season release. This is the kind of respect that I hope I can see for ""The Wayans Bros."", ""Murphy Brown"" ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" etc real soon. But bottom line ""Fresh Prince"" is a great classic show.
