The man knows his stuff and groups like National Geographic sponser him so that is as good as it gets.It is also a main example of training people! not always dogs.Very much recommended.

1174802,A3U1WPDQLP9CQ,B001C4N5MI,Lemon,"[78, 79]","We started following Cesar's methods two years ago when we bought a new puppy.  I had owned many dogs over the years, and thought I knew what I was doing when it came to training, but once we began adopting Cesar's methods it put everything in a new perspective.  Cesar teaches you how to be the pack leader, and it is miraculous the impact it has on the dog.  He helps you understand dogs, and once you do it becomes very easy to mold them into the ideal pet and companion. And his mantra of ""calm assertive energy"" is a great lesson for life - not just in how you interact with your pet. Using his methods we have molded our puppy into a terrific, happy, disciplined, calm companion - and I now have the best relationship I have ever had with an animal. I strongly recommend this series for anyone that has a dog or is considering getting a dog - or even if you have to interact with dogs.  In fact, before learning from Cesar my wife was afraid of dogs, and now that she understands them it has added a new dimension to her life and alleviated all her fears.

1174803,A3EZ2PLA8AFPIF,B001C4N5MI,"""The Woj""","[46, 48]","Our family was fortunate and blessed enough to acquire two wonderful Coton De Tulear puppies.  We tried several books, videos and dvds to help us raise the puppies properly.  Some helped, some did not. A basic fundamental principle seemed to be missing in each one we tried.  Then we discovered Cesar Milan. The concept we were missing was a simple one: Cesar's term ""pack leader"".  Since purchasing and renting from our local library every piece of  Cesar Milan media we could find, our relationship with our puppies has blossomed.  This 3 DVD set is a great place to start.  Cesar's books are fine, but it's like reading how to ride a bike or hit a baseball; books make it difficult to visualize Cesar's concepts.  Plus Cesar himself is someone who needs to be seen.  He's calm, controlled, loving  and totally in  charge of the dogs.  For anyone who wants to ""maximize the potential"" of the relationship they have with their dog(s), I give this set my highest recommendation. As an aside, Cesar's techniques have helped with my children too!  Add this to your cart ASAP, you and your dog will not regret it!",5,Hail Cesar!!,1222128000,"09 23, 2008",2008,1110,"['family', 'was', 'fortunate', 'blessed', 'enough', 'acquire', 'two', 'wonderful', 'Coton', 'De', 'Tulear', 'puppies', 'tried', 'several', 'books', 'videos', 'dvds', 'help', 'raise', 'puppies', 'properly', 'helped', 'did', 'not', 'basic', 'fundamental', 'principle', 'seemed', 'be', 'missing', 'one', 'tried', 'Then', 'discovered', 'Cesar', 'Milan', 'concept', 'were', 'missing', 'was', 'simple', 'one', 'Cesar', 'term', 'pack', 'leader', 'purchasing', 'renting', 'local', 'library', 'piece', 'Cesar', 'Milan', 'media', 'could', 'find', 'relationship', 'puppies', 'blossomed', '3', 'DVD', 'set', 'great', 'place', 'start', 'Cesar', 'books', 'are', 'fine', 'reading', 'how', 'ride', 'bike', 'hit', 'baseball', 'books', 'make', 'difficult', 'visualize', 'Cesar', 'concepts', 'Cesar', 'someone', 'who', 'be', 'seen', 'calm', 'controlled', 'loving', 'totally', 'charge', 'dogs', 'anyone', 'who', 'maximize', 'potential', 'relationship', 'have', 'dog', 's', 'give', 'set', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'aside', 'Cesar', 'techniques', 'have', 'helped', 'children', 'too', 'Add', 'cart', 'ASAP', 'dog', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",Cesar Millan's Mastering Leadership - Volumes 1-3

The DVD's were done concisely and were not too long in viewing length.  Some of things Cesear says in the show are more fully explained in these DVD's.  I have always believed in dealing with dogs that humans are ""the boss"" and Cesear has a great way of showing how to do it so the dogs understand it.  Too bad he doesn't teach parents how to be ""the boss"" for their children!!!!",4,I'm a huge Cesear fan!,1227571200,"11 25, 2008",2008,479,"['was', 'interesting', 'DVD', 'feel', 'will', 'be', 'helpful', 'especially', 'when', 'bringing', 'new', 'pet', 'home', 'DVD', 'were', 'done', 'concisely', 'were', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'viewing', 'length', 'things', 'Cesear', 'show', 'are', 'more', 'fully', 'explained', 'DVD', 'have', 'always', 'believed', 'dealing', 'dogs', 'humans', 'are', 'boss', 'Cesear', 'great', 'way', 'showing', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'dogs', 'understand', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'teach', 'parents', 'how', 'be', 'boss', 'children']",Cesar Millan's Mastering Leadership - Volumes 1-3
