I am a big horror fan and love the Hellraiser collection so this was automatically a must in my book. The downside to this is well, you have one disc that each have two movies on each side. Miramax could have made it into two discs with two on each side instead.This set follows Hellraiser: Hellbound (#2) and goes into Hellraiser: Deader (#7) afterwards. There is some high's and low's throughout each movie but all in all this is a good set to buy and faster to collect them.",5,Pinhead is back,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,591,"['picked', 'dvd', 'due', 'fact', 'easier', 'get', 'together', 'rather', 'paying', 'more', 'get', 'separate', 'am', 'big', 'horror', 'fan', 'love', 'Hellraiser', 'collection', 'so', 'was', 'automatically', 'must', 'book', 'downside', 'well', 'have', 'one', 'disc', 'have', 'two', 'movies', 'side', 'Miramax', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'two', 'discs', 'two', 'side', 'instead.This', 'set', 'Hellraiser', 'Hellbound', '2', 'Hellraiser', 'Deader', '7', 'afterwards', 'high', 'low', 'movie', 'good', 'set', 'buy', 'faster', 'collect']",N/A

Hellraiser series is amazing, but I do like some of the movies more than others in this series. My favorite out of this disc set is Hell on Earth. This set is worth the money, even though it's one disc with the 4 movies on both sides. The other 3 movies I don't like as much, but they're still good.",4,Hellraiser is Great,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,361,"['love', 'series', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'series', 'Hellraiser', 'series', 'amazing', 'do', 'movies', 'more', 'others', 'series', 'My', 'favorite', 'disc', 'set', 'Hell', 'Earth', 'set', 'money', 'even', 'one', 'disc', '4', 'movies', 'sides', 'other', '3', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'much', ""'re"", 'still', 'good']",N/A
