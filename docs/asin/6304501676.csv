426608,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,6304501676,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 1]","So let's see. Shaquille O'Neal stars as a rapping genie . . . and it already goes downhill from here. The first major flaw of Kazaam is Shaq. Look, he's a very good basketball player (I liked him when he was still with the Los Angeles Lakers), but he is definitely not a very good actor. His performance is really bland and his emotions don't look like emotions at all, except when he gives that creepy smile. And then, there's his rapping. I've only heard Shaq rap a couple of times in my lifetime, and it had to include this. There are scenes in which the title character is giving a live concert in a club. There is also one scene in which he does a random rap number in the middle of the film with Max (the kid protagonist). If you think it sounds really bad, wait until you hear the lyrics. The lyrics . . . MY GOD! These aren't real rap lyrics! They sound like kid stuff! But hey, it's supposed to be a family film, and the lyrics are supposed to be family-friendly . . . I'm going to go listen to Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz right after I publish this review.But these aren't the only flaws in the film. No, you also have the kid protagonist Max. I swear, this kid has got to be one of the most annoying characters in family-film history! It's really hard to care for him. Same goes for the villain. He's so two-dimensional even for a family film that he makes other family-friendly villains look like Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men. Then, there's the special effects, which are some of the most horrible ever seen. In one particular scene when he is on his flying bicycle, you can tell that Shaq is right behind a green screen. I guess they were trying to save some of the money that were put into this lame movie.So yeah, the critics and half of the Amazon reviewers are correct. This is one of the worst movies ever made. I would say that this is just as bad as Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and Batman & Robin.

I have always found him to be entertaining and believe that he is genuinely a nice guy. Well the year was 1996 I believe when Shaq let loose his rapping genie in movie theaters across the country. To be honest it is an interesting idea because of his size and celeberty appeal. But also as long as we are honest he is not the best actor ever. Still for kids this actually a good movie because when I was younger I remember loving this movie, for the adults maybe not so much.Max is just your average kid wanting to be cool, not picked on at school, and the victim of a normal situation. That of course would be never really knowing his dad and mama has a new boyfriend. So he is having and over all bad time at this point in his life, that is until he literally falls into some good luck. When running from the school bullies one day he falls various floors and lands right on top of the magic boom box. In doing so he releases the genie named Kazaam. From there things get interesting as Kazaam tries to convince Max he is the real deal and will grant three wishes. Once he realizes what he has the time is now for Max to change his luck, if all works out.This is a very fun one for the kiddies as Shaq really is an entertaining guy and the fun of the wishes will make it a hit with any kid. As for the adults it can still be fun if you turn off the brain but this is far from a perfect film. Let us start with the acting because our lead needed some work. Shaq is very outgoing and fun in the role and actually for his acting abilities this may be his best job, he hams it up. Still he will never win any awards for acting but at least in a non serious role he can have fun with it. Francis Capra did a good enough job as Max especially for a child actor, he has a new look now and has done some good stuff. Everyone else in the film did a good job from his parents to mama's boyfriend.As for the writing it really needs some work from the older stand point, of course this is for kids and on that level it works. Director Paul Glaser along with fellow writers Roger Soffer and Christian Ford [who still write together] needed to pick it up a bit for the parents but for the kiddies it works. I find it hard to really dig into this because I know it is for kids, plus I liked it a lot when I was younger. Still this may not be the best choice for the serious movie fan, really it is not. This may not be the best movie ever but for those who like to turn it off it is fun, I liked it then I like it now.",3,5 STARS FOR KIDS,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2654,"['KAZAAMShaquille', ""O'Neal"", 'course', 'world', 'famous', 'basketball', 'player', 'entertainer', 'who', 'done', 'act', 'rap', 'course', 'playing', 'ball', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'be', 'entertaining', 'believe', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'guy', 'Well', 'year', 'was', '1996', 'believe', 'when', 'Shaq', 'let', 'loose', 'rapping', 'genie', 'movie', 'theaters', 'country', 'be', 'honest', 'interesting', 'idea', 'size', 'celeberty', 'appeal', 'also', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'honest', 'not', 'best', 'actor', 'ever', 'Still', 'kids', 'actually', 'good', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'remember', 'loving', 'movie', 'adults', 'maybe', 'not', 'so', 'much.Max', 'just', 'average', 'kid', 'wanting', 'be', 'cool', 'not', 'picked', 'school', 'victim', 'normal', 'situation', 'course', 'would', 'be', 'never', 'really', 'knowing', 'dad', 'mama', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'having', 'bad', 'time', 'point', 'life', 'literally', 'good', 'luck', 'When', 'running', 'school', 'bullies', 'one', 'day', 'various', 'floors', 'lands', 'right', 'top', 'magic', 'boom', 'box', 'doing', 'so', 'genie', 'named', 'Kazaam', 'things', 'get', 'interesting', 'Kazaam', 'convince', 'Max', 'real', 'deal', 'will', 'grant', 'three', 'wishes', 'Once', 'what', 'time', 'now', 'Max', 'change', 'luck', 'out.This', 'very', 'fun', 'one', 'kiddies', 'Shaq', 'really', 'entertaining', 'guy', 'fun', 'wishes', 'will', 'make', 'hit', 'kid', 'adults', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'turn', 'off', 'brain', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'Let', 'start', 'acting', 'lead', 'needed', 'work', 'Shaq', 'very', 'outgoing', 'fun', 'role', 'actually', 'acting', 'abilities', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'job', 'up', 'Still', 'will', 'never', 'win', 'awards', 'acting', 'least', 'non', 'serious', 'role', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'Francis', 'Capra', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'job', 'Max', 'especially', 'child', 'actor', 'new', 'look', 'now', 'done', 'good', 'stuff', 'Everyone', 'else', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'parents', 'mama', 'boyfriend.As', 'writing', 'really', 'work', 'older', 'stand', 'point', 'course', 'kids', 'level', 'Director', 'Paul', 'Glaser', 'fellow', 'writers', 'Roger', 'Soffer', 'Christian', 'Ford', '[', 'who', 'still', 'write', 'together', ']', 'needed', 'pick', 'up', 'bit', 'parents', 'kiddies', 'find', 'hard', 'really', 'dig', 'know', 'kids', 'liked', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Still', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'choice', 'serious', 'movie', 'fan', 'really', 'not', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'movie', 'ever', 'who', 'like', 'turn', 'off', 'fun', 'liked', 'then', 'now']",Kazaam VHS

Let's face it, the man can do it all.Kazaam is a movie unlike any other. Now some would say that Shaq's acting is so wooden he could play Pinnochio, but I argue with that. Shaq was playing a genie, a magical, rapping, abracadabra, hocus-pocus genie. The hippest, illest, defest, genie you ever laid eyes on. It is not for us to rate this film, it is for us to thank Shaq for taking the time to make this movie.Now some would say that he can't even act his way through a 30 second commercial for Nestle Crunch or Burger King. I argue the point again. Shaq has the intelligence and mastery of the English language that we mortals can only hope to achieve. He is the reigning king of entertainment.Others will also say that the man is slightly retarded and that if not for his great height, he would be lucky to ride the back of a garbage truck in Chicago as a sanitation engineer. I say those people have a real attitude problem.Shaq can do it all. I am looking forward to his opera album, his cooking show, his line of BVD briefs, and last but certainly not least, I am looking forward to Shaq teaming up with Ice-T.

Does every movie you see have to obtain the highest possible production values every moment or its DRECK &lt;GARBAGE&gt;!  Sometimes all I require of my movie is that it be fun with a cute ending message and KAZAAM delivers royally.Come on people lighten up.  This movie was just meant to be fun nothing else.  Kazaam has a cute little message of a child's hope sustained in the midst of adversity by a special friend a meassge delivered rather well.  Kazaam's bad singing hehehe its just fun remember it's one of those hey Genie dude don't quit your day job things.  I am an adult and I loved this movie.  Shaq did a great job in it.  Shaq gave the Genie a wild special urban flavor, compassion and dignity that is way different from all traditional Genie depictions that I found refreshing.  Shaq was a hood Genie, everyone in the Hood thinks they are the next Ghetto I M A COOOL Dude rap super star.  A hood Genie living in a boom box would not logically be any different from all the rest of the rap star want-ta-bee's hence the movie keeps to its urban theme.Kazzam is for kids or the adult who has managed to remain a kid at heart anyone else has done more than JUST grow up they have gotten old in the worse context.  There is no more fun inside you if there are no connections to the joys and pains of youth this movie taps into.  If your heart is still young you will love Kazaam if not I pity you.P.S.
