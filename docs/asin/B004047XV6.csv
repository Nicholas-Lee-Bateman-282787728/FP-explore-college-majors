1378693,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B004047XV6,maskedgamer,"[0, 1]",I thought the first season was alright. I liked the characters just wasn't into the story so much. More so because it didn't reveal too much about the main character. Then season 2 and BAM! They really turn up the heat. This one takes away all the goofiness and gets deadly serious. If you can't tell by Birdy's expression on the box cover you're in for some stuff with this one.This season focuses more on Birdy and her past. It's amazing how they switched up the the story from season 1. which was so light hearted. I heard they don't plan to make a Season 3 I really hope that was a joke. This is def an anime I could watch for 100+ episodes. Way too good to be only 2 seasons!,5,Wow This is better than the first season but so short?,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",2011,680,"['thought', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'alright', 'liked', 'characters', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'story', 'so', 'much', 'More', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'too', 'much', 'main', 'character', 'Then', 'season', '2', 'BAM', 'really', 'turn', 'up', 'heat', 'one', 'away', 'goofiness', 'deadly', 'serious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'Birdy', 'expression', 'box', 'cover', ""'re"", 'stuff', 'one.This', 'season', 'more', 'Birdy', 'past', 'amazing', 'how', 'switched', 'up', 'story', 'season', '1.', 'was', 'so', 'light', 'hearted', 'heard', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'make', 'Season', '3', 'really', 'hope', 'was', 'joke', 'def', 'anime', 'could', 'watch', '100+', 'episodes', 'Way', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'only', '2', 'seasons']",Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02
1378694,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B004047XV6,Paul Jutras,"[1, 2]",Birdy the mighty season 2 picks up not long after season 1.  Part of the city is still a disaster zone from the destruction caused in the final episode of season 1 and Birdy has the free time to go back to her pop star disguise.  When a jail break happens in space the criminals retreat to earth and disguise themselves among the humans.  Birdy is given a new assignment to round up the crooks. Too bad for the crooks that while Birdy merely wants to arrest them one of Birdy's childhood friends is plotting to kill the crooks off one by one. Its a race on who will get them first.  If Birdy's problems weren't enough she also finds her brain slowly being over written and taken over by the human boy sharing her body.  A problem that will take us into Birdy's memories and her past growing up to become the officer she is today. Even learning how she got her nickname.,5,New adventures for another time,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,869,"['mighty', 'season', '2', 'picks', 'up', 'not', 'long', 'season', '1', 'Part', 'city', 'still', 'disaster', 'zone', 'destruction', 'caused', 'final', 'episode', 'season', '1', 'Birdy', 'free', 'time', 'go', 'back', 'pop', 'star', 'disguise', 'When', 'jail', 'break', 'space', 'criminals', 'retreat', 'earth', 'disguise', 'humans', 'Birdy', 'given', 'new', 'assignment', 'round', 'up', 'crooks', 'Too', 'bad', 'crooks', 'Birdy', 'merely', 'arrest', 'one', 'Birdy', 'childhood', 'friends', 'plotting', 'kill', 'crooks', 'one', 'one', 'race', 'who', 'will', 'get', 'first', 'Birdy', 'problems', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'also', 'brain', 'slowly', 'being', 'over', 'written', 'taken', 'over', 'human', 'boy', 'sharing', 'body', 'problem', 'will', 'take', 'Birdy', 'memories', 'past', 'growing', 'up', 'become', 'officer', 'today', 'Even', 'learning', 'how', 'got', 'nickname']",Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02
1378695,AFZGZTMGACBQO,B004047XV6,Paul Vincent,"[7, 11]","Birdy the Mighty: Decode, season 2 is a truly great anime Sci-Fi series that excels in just about everything - plot, animation, audio, and action. Basically it's a series that would be the result of combining Men in Black, Wonder woman, and Blade Runner. You can find all kinds of information of what the series is about elsewhere, so this will be a review of the Funimation release, which is what it should be about. I received my copy in on Friday 11/12.Watching Funimation's DVD set of season 2 was the second time through the season, and it still was as good as watching the first time through. Visually the DVD is mastered well with the video having good resolution, color, and motion handling. The audio is well done too, though only output in stereo with Japanese w/English subtitles. The only thing that has been mentioned on forums is the ending for each episode has had English credits imposed over the original video, with the video image resized like a picture in picture view, sitting over in the top left corner. Personally it's not a big deal to me, the episode closing/openings get in the way of going through a series - I almost always skip right to the episode beginning for anime series. I do like the second season opening very much; Content of the disc is just Birdy the Mighty Decode episodes on both discs with Funimation trailers in addition on the second disc. No clean OP/ED or other additional bonus items.Overall, this is a solid release for visual and audio quality. My personal opinion is the English track takes away too much from the series, it just doesn't feel like you are watching the same show. Birdy the Mighty: Decode (both seasons) is one of my favorite anime series; you can really connect with what the characters are going through. It would only be better being released on Blu-Ray (properly - not a release like Funimation's status quo upscales.)Edit: FYI, The OVA Cipher episode is included in this set as Episode 26. It is highly recommended you watch Episode 26 before watching 14-25.",4,"Story better than part 1, quality about the same...",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,2031,"['Mighty', 'Decode', 'season', '2', 'truly', 'great', 'anime', 'Sci-Fi', 'series', 'just', 'everything', 'plot', 'animation', 'audio', 'action', 'Basically', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'result', 'combining', 'Men', 'Black', 'Wonder', 'woman', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'can', 'find', 'kinds', 'information', 'what', 'series', 'elsewhere', 'will', 'be', 'review', 'Funimation', 'release', 'what', 'should', 'be', 'received', 'copy', 'Friday', '11/12.Watching', 'Funimation', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', '2', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'season', 'still', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'Visually', 'DVD', 'mastered', 'well', 'video', 'having', 'good', 'resolution', 'color', 'motion', 'handling', 'audio', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'only', 'output', 'stereo', 'Japanese', 'w/English', 'subtitles', 'only', 'thing', 'been', 'mentioned', 'forums', 'ending', 'episode', 'had', 'English', 'credits', 'imposed', 'original', 'video', 'video', 'image', 'resized', 'picture', 'picture', 'view', 'sitting', 'top', 'left', 'corner', 'Personally', 'not', 'big', 'deal', 'episode', 'closing/openings', 'get', 'way', 'going', 'series', 'almost', 'always', 'skip', 'right', 'episode', 'beginning', 'anime', 'series', 'do', 'second', 'season', 'opening', 'very', 'much', 'Content', 'disc', 'just', 'Birdy', 'Mighty', 'Decode', 'discs', 'Funimation', 'trailers', 'addition', 'second', 'disc', 'clean', 'OP/ED', 'other', 'additional', 'bonus', 'items.Overall', 'solid', 'release', 'visual', 'audio', 'quality', 'personal', 'opinion', 'English', 'track', 'away', 'too', 'much', 'series', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'same', 'show', 'Mighty', 'Decode', 'seasons', 'one', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'can', 'really', 'connect', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'going', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'better', 'being', 'released', 'Blu-Ray', 'properly', 'not', 'release', 'Funimation', 'status', 'quo', 'upscales', 'Edit', 'FYI', 'OVA', 'Cipher', 'episode', 'included', 'set', 'Episode', '26', 'highly', 'recommended', 'watch', 'Episode', '26', 'watching', '14-25']",Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02

The story follows mostly on the day to day actions of a female alien police office called Birdy who has come to earth in order to track down interstellar felons and bring them to justice,  though during one of her case assignments she unwittingly gets a young earth high school Tsutomu Senkawa killed but due to the highly advanced technology she is party to she is able to get the boys body reconstructed though during this time his consciousness now resides inside of Birdy's body so the two must now try and coexist with each other while trying to live their own personal lives and try and fulfill their personal obligations as well.  The situation allows the two to use the body with the others consent for the most part or if the other mind is asleep or unconscious, the body also changes gender for the person controlling it so when Birdy is in control the body is female when Tsutomu is in control the body is male but most time both of their minds are awake which allows the two to communicate with each other(Though for Tsutomu it can get a bit embarrassing since they must talk normally which at times make him look a little crazy when it seems he's talking to himself.)  The series is a nice mix of sci-fi thriller,  action, comedy and the usual touch of angst teen romance thrown in as well as Tsutomu must constantly find reasons to give to his friends for his untimely disappearances as well as adjust to being in a women's body when Birdy is in control.  The series is open ended while giving us a decent since of closure to most of the story of what's happening the series main story is left open as to give the creators a leeway if they wish to continue the anime series later on.  The series set comes in two parts but in all for the complete series four dvds put into thin dvd packs and a paper sleeve,  The extras aren't much just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs.  The animation  The animation is very good but you will feel a tad sense of reminiscent as it seems to have a similar animation to the series Eureka 7 and Xam'd,  The voice cast for the Japanese subbed and English dubbed were done very well too being a longtime fan of the dubbed actress Luci Christian as Birdy and relatively new comer Micah Solusod as Tsutomu Senkawa were a perfect match for their character roles.  So if you're looking for a great sci-fi action series with a touch of comedy or just a entertaining anime series in general here's a great one for you home anime library....",5,A Great Sci-Fi Action With A Little Touch Of Ranma 1/2,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",2011,2713,"['seeing', 'series', 'knew', 'right', 'away', 'was', 'one', 'anime', 'collection', 'had', 'get', 'one', 'buyer', 'reason', 'Amazon', 'was', 'not', 'selling', 'first', 'part', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'story', 'mostly', 'day', 'day', 'actions', 'female', 'alien', 'police', 'office', 'called', 'Birdy', 'who', 'come', 'earth', 'order', 'track', 'down', 'interstellar', 'felons', 'bring', 'justice', 'one', 'case', 'unwittingly', 'young', 'earth', 'high', 'school', 'Tsutomu', 'Senkawa', 'killed', 'due', 'highly', 'advanced', 'technology', 'party', 'able', 'get', 'boys', 'body', 'reconstructed', 'time', 'consciousness', 'now', 'Birdy', 'body', 'so', 'two', 'must', 'now', 'try', 'coexist', 'other', 'trying', 'live', 'own', 'personal', 'lives', 'try', 'fulfill', 'personal', 'obligations', 'well', 'situation', 'two', 'use', 'body', 'others', 'consent', 'most', 'part', 'other', 'mind', 'asleep', 'unconscious', 'body', 'also', 'gender', 'person', 'controlling', 'so', 'when', 'Birdy', 'control', 'body', 'female', 'when', 'Tsutomu', 'control', 'body', 'male', 'most', 'time', 'minds', 'are', 'awake', 'two', 'communicate', 'other', 'Tsutomu', 'can', 'get', 'bit', 'embarrassing', 'must', 'talk', 'normally', 'times', 'make', 'look', 'little', 'crazy', 'when', 'talking', 'series', 'nice', 'mix', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'action', 'comedy', 'usual', 'touch', 'angst', 'teen', 'romance', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'Tsutomu', 'must', 'constantly', 'find', 'reasons', 'give', 'friends', 'untimely', 'disappearances', 'as', 'well', 'adjust', 'being', 'women', 'body', 'when', 'Birdy', 'control', 'series', 'open', 'ended', 'giving', 'decent', 'closure', 'most', 'story', 'what', 'happening', 'series', 'main', 'story', 'left', 'open', 'give', 'creators', 'leeway', 'wish', 'continue', 'anime', 'series', 'later', 'series', 'set', 'two', 'parts', 'complete', 'series', 'four', 'dvds', 'put', 'thin', 'dvd', 'packs', 'paper', 'sleeve', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'just', 'usual', 'trailers', 'textless', 'intro/ending', 'songs', 'animation', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'will', 'feel', 'tad', 'sense', 'reminiscent', 'have', 'similar', 'animation', 'series', 'Eureka', '7', 'Xam', ""'d"", 'voice', 'cast', 'Japanese', 'subbed', 'English', 'dubbed', 'were', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'being', 'longtime', 'fan', 'dubbed', 'actress', 'Luci', 'Christian', 'Birdy', 'relatively', 'new', 'comer', 'Micah', 'Solusod', 'Tsutomu', 'Senkawa', 'were', 'perfect', 'match', 'character', 'roles', 'So', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'series', 'touch', 'comedy', 'just', 'entertaining', 'anime', 'series', 'general', 'here', 'great', 'one', 'home', 'anime', 'library']",Birdy the Mighty: Decode 02
