1197654,A27VMEB55OY9LS,B001GLLLFK,Kathy-W,"[0, 0]","If you're new to Victor Borge but are a little bit adventurous with your budget (just a little bit), I can recommend this set. Yes, some material is unnecessarily included in slightly different forms (not actual clip duplications, but some of the same routines are included on multiple DVDs). So why get this set? It'll be less legwork for you later. This is by no means a complete, all-encompassing set. Yet when you consider that Amazon now charges $4 per item in shipping (remember, Amazon doesn't combine shipping on the inexpensive USED items that most people seek out), you only need to be interested in a few of these to make it an equal value on your wallet. There's just enough different material to make it worth it, at least in my opinion. &#34;Acts One & Two&#34; (which I have reviewed separately) is worth watching, as is &#34;Then & Now.&#34; The two &#34;Lost Episodes&#34; discs don't necessarily give you earth-shattering new material, but a fair bit of what's included *is* less familiar to some people.Why the devil they needed to pad this set out to be 6 discs is beyond me - perhaps it was just the profit bug delivering its bite. A word of caution: since much of this footage is very old and mediocre archival film, the picture and sound quality were only going to be so good (especially on the 1950s-era portions). I would remind everyone that even the best audio/visual tech advances these days cannot correct poor original quality. If grainy film and various background sound noises bother you, don't buy it. I have seen enough old movies to know that nothing here is unacceptable in comparison. These are never going to get the sparkling high definition Blu-Ray treatment because some of them really can't be restored much beyond what you see here.As long as you buy a used set, this is a decent value and will require less hunting (these were available as 6 individual releases long before they got the idea to stick them all into a box set). I only see 4 of them (the ones I mention above) as being anything near compulsory viewing. But since you would pay $16 for the shipping alone (at least on Amazon) to buy the 4 of them separately, a moderately-priced used set won't feel like an unbearable moneygrub. Conversely, if you're new to Victor and want to be cautious, then just go buy one or two individual DVDs and consider yourself spared from unnecessary expense. I snagged this set for $8 and considered that amount to be a good investment for my personal collection.5 stars for Victor, but take away a star for the bloated feeling of this set (which some people will, understandably, call a repackaging at best or a rehash at worst). If I didn't adore this Dane's comedy so much, I might have subtracted TWO stars, but I don't have the heart to do that.",4,"Yes, there is ""overlap"" and some repetition between discs, but...",1387065600,"12 15, 2013",2013,2788,"[""'re"", 'new', 'Victor', 'Borge', 'are', 'little', 'bit', 'adventurous', 'budget', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'can', 'recommend', 'set', 'Yes', 'material', 'unnecessarily', 'included', 'slightly', 'different', 'forms', 'not', 'actual', 'clip', 'duplications', 'same', 'routines', 'are', 'included', 'multiple', 'DVDs', 'why', 'get', 'set', ""'ll"", 'be', 'less', 'legwork', 'later', 'means', 'complete', 'all-encompassing', 'set', 'when', 'consider', 'Amazon', 'now', '4', 'item', 'shipping', 'remember', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'combine', 'shipping', 'inexpensive', 'USED', 'items', 'most', 'people', 'seek', 'out', 'only', 'need', 'be', 'interested', 'few', 'make', 'equal', 'value', 'wallet', 'just', 'enough', 'different', 'material', 'make', 'least', 'opinion', '34', 'Acts', 'One', 'Two', '34', 'have', 'reviewed', 'separately', 'worth', 'watching', '34', 'Then', 'Now.', '34', 'two', '34', 'Lost', 'Episodes', '34', 'discs', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'give', 'earth-shattering', 'new', 'material', 'fair', 'bit', 'what', 'included', '*is*', 'less', 'familiar', 'people.Why', 'devil', 'needed', 'pad', 'set', 'out', 'be', '6', 'discs', 'perhaps', 'was', 'just', 'profit', 'bug', 'delivering', 'bite', 'word', 'caution', 'much', 'footage', 'very', 'old', 'mediocre', 'archival', 'film', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'were', 'only', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'especially', '1950s-era', 'portions', 'would', 'remind', 'everyone', 'even', 'best', 'audio/visual', 'tech', 'advances', 'days', 'can', 'not', 'correct', 'poor', 'original', 'quality', 'grainy', 'film', 'various', 'background', 'sound', 'bother', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'old', 'movies', 'know', 'nothing', 'here', 'unacceptable', 'comparison', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'sparkling', 'high', 'definition', 'Blu-Ray', 'treatment', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'restored', 'much', 'what', 'see', 'here.As', 'long', 'buy', 'used', 'set', 'decent', 'value', 'will', 'require', 'less', 'hunting', 'were', 'available', '6', 'individual', 'releases', 'long', 'got', 'idea', 'stick', 'box', 'set', 'only', 'see', '4', 'ones', 'mention', 'above', 'being', 'anything', 'compulsory', 'viewing', 'would', 'pay', '16', 'shipping', 'alone', 'least', 'Amazon', 'buy', '4', 'separately', 'moderately-priced', 'used', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'unbearable', 'moneygrub', 'Conversely', ""'re"", 'new', 'Victor', 'want', 'be', 'cautious', 'then', 'just', 'go', 'buy', 'one', 'two', 'individual', 'DVDs', 'consider', 'spared', 'unnecessary', 'expense', 'snagged', 'set', '8', 'considered', 'amount', 'be', 'good', 'investment', 'personal', 'collection.5', 'stars', 'Victor', 'take', 'away', 'star', 'bloated', 'feeling', 'set', 'people', 'will', 'understandably', 'call', 'repackaging', 'best', 'rehash', 'worst', 'did', ""n't"", 'adore', 'Dane', 'comedy', 'so', 'much', 'might', 'have', 'subtracted', 'TWO', 'stars', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'do']",Victor Borge Classic Collection
