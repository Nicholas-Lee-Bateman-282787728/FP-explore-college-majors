1621226,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00B2JUO2C,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 2]","Zombie movies are the flavor of the moment and have been for a while now. At least one film featuring some variation of the walking dead is released a week. However, I wouldn't necessarily call the creatures we see in ""Infected"" traditional zombies.The ""Infected"" people in this never die. They get sick from exposure to Lyme disease by being bit by an animal or person who contracted it or ate something it was in, such as contaminated meat. The individuals who are infected don't just lumber around aimlessly. They actually resemble rabid animals, talk, and move rapidly.Although the zombies in ""Infected"" aren't typical, the set-up of the movie is. We have a group of people trapped in a cabin in the woods. They must fight off the diseased as they attempt to break into the house and eat every living thing inside. The characters end up having to make the choice to kill off their friends and relatives who are bitten and contaminated.Veteran actors Michael Madsen and William Forsythe take their roles more serious than they should for an independent horror film like of this caliber. The two of them give ""Infected"" a touch of class that elevates it above other zombie movies being released. Forsythe does ham it up a little and adds some campiness to the film. Madsen plays serious throughout the entire thing as if he's targeting an Oscar for his part.Christy Carlson Romano (""Even Stevens"") stars as a woman concerned about her grandmother as she gets sicker from the mysterious illness. She's the focus of one of the most spectacularly gruesome parts of the film.""Infected"" as a whole isn't anything we haven't seen before. Sure, the main cause of the epidemic is unique. That doesn't change the fact that the gory details and the outcome of the movie remain the same as any other living dead flick. It will no doubt thrill viewers who aren't used to watching horror movies as well as genre fans looking for the week's zombie fix.",3,"DVD Review: ""Infected""",1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,1940,"['Zombie', 'movies', 'are', 'flavor', 'moment', 'have', 'been', 'while', 'now', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'featuring', 'variation', 'walking', 'dead', 'released', 'week', 'However', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'call', 'creatures', 'see', 'Infected', 'traditional', 'zombies.The', 'Infected', 'people', 'never', 'die', 'get', 'sick', 'exposure', 'Lyme', 'disease', 'being', 'bit', 'animal', 'person', 'who', 'contracted', 'ate', 'something', 'was', 'such', 'contaminated', 'meat', 'individuals', 'who', 'are', 'infected', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'lumber', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'actually', 'resemble', 'rabid', 'animals', 'talk', 'move', 'zombies', 'Infected', 'are', ""n't"", 'typical', 'set-up', 'movie', 'have', 'group', 'people', 'trapped', 'cabin', 'woods', 'must', 'fight', 'off', 'diseased', 'attempt', 'break', 'house', 'eat', 'living', 'thing', 'inside', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'make', 'choice', 'kill', 'off', 'friends', 'relatives', 'who', 'are', 'bitten', 'contaminated.Veteran', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'take', 'roles', 'more', 'serious', 'should', 'independent', 'horror', 'film', 'caliber', 'two', 'give', 'Infected', 'touch', 'class', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'Forsythe', 'ham', 'up', 'little', 'campiness', 'film', 'Madsen', 'serious', 'entire', 'thing', 'targeting', 'Oscar', 'part.Christy', 'Carlson', 'Romano', 'Even', 'Stevens', 'woman', 'concerned', 'grandmother', 'sicker', 'mysterious', 'illness', 'focus', 'one', 'most', 'spectacularly', 'gruesome', 'parts', 'film', 'Infected', 'whole', ""n't"", 'anything', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Sure', 'main', 'cause', 'epidemic', 'unique', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'gory', 'details', 'outcome', 'movie', 'remain', 'same', 'other', 'living', 'dead', 'flick', 'will', 'no', 'doubt', 'thrill', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'watching', 'horror', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'genre', 'fans', 'looking', 'week', 'zombie', 'fix']",N/A
1621227,AVR1TVB3NKTFO,B00B2JUO2C,Johnny Goodwin,"[0, 1]","Bless their hears, they tried, they just didn't try hard enough to even make a decent ""infected"" movie! Now, I saw the low star score evaluate for this movie, but I really liked the idea of infected over the reanimation of dead story line and had hopes that with big name actors, this film would be pretty good... or at least decent enough for me to want to re-watch it, however it was not!Where to start?... Well, the movie starts out and the opening credits are over a scene of a half naked man (Verdi) doing a little blacksmithing. There is nothing like pounding on red hot metal, bare chested, while rabid cannibals have taken over the planet  ... I half expected the guy to finish up with a shower, advertising body wash or deodorant! And so begins a movie full of characters saying and doing and acting in ways that seem totally unrealistic...Three men have decided  to go on a hunting weekend and they have brought their children along...(two of which are vegetarian, but who really cares) now I think if these men know all about hunting, then why is it that only one guy actually dressed in camo? Madsen and Forsythe were dressed like Madsen and an British Literature professor from Oxford. So Forsythe is supposed to be a doctor, medical doctor that is, however he acts and dresses like a college English professor. He goes to have a look at an ill neighbor, whips out a thermometer and stethoscope, sees she has a high fever and then gets bit by her and decides that ""rabid granny"" (who looks like she ought to have been put in the hospital a week ago) will be fine and just needs to stay at home and in bed!  Does he give dear rabid granny an aspirin to help take the edge off the fever?, nope, just a little sleeping pill! Infected cannibal dad rants on cell phone and smashes computer monitor in a junk yard. A tid o biddie hooker decides to forgo a pay by the hour motel for an area in the woods, right off a hiking trail. And those are just some of  the scenes in this movie that last way too long and do nothing to forward or inform the movie. And then there is the crappy ""atmosphere"" music they use to try to intensify the drama and action, I felt like I was at a cheesy ""hair band"" concert from the 1980s! Cinematography was also really bad.Sadly, the most interesting part of the movie was the very last half, where the blacksmith body wash model was going out into the wilds looking for supplies to bring back to the camp of survivors!To sum it all up, you can't make a good ""zombie / infected"" movie with just a good idea! Sadly a low budget is not the reason this movie is so bad! Like I have preached in so many other ""zombie"" movie reviews; you need to put forth some effort and thought into writing a script, writing realistic dialogue, and developing your characters! For the love of wanting to make a decent zombie movie...... hire a writer or an editor!!! The acting was so - so, the best actors was the guy playing the hunter that actually wore camo (to a hunting weekend) and the pregnant wife of Madsen's character... (they really seemed to get what the movie was supposed to be about and probably did their own character development)! Forsythe was just creepy and weird and Madsen seemed uncomfortable and acted awkward while his mysterious character drank and hunted and drank and ranted and drank and hunted some more... drinking and guns, a perfect match for a hunting weekend!Yes, Verdi tried, if only he had tried a little harder!",1,Rabid Granny pt 2... only not as good,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",2013,3468,"['Bless', 'hears', 'tried', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'even', 'make', 'decent', 'infected', 'movie', 'Now', 'saw', 'low', 'star', 'score', 'evaluate', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'idea', 'infected', 'reanimation', 'dead', 'story', 'line', 'had', 'hopes', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'least', 'decent', 'enough', 'want', 're-watch', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'Where', 'start', 'Well', 'movie', 'out', 'opening', 'credits', 'are', 'scene', 'half', 'naked', 'man', 'Verdi', 'doing', 'little', 'blacksmithing', 'nothing', 'pounding', 'red', 'hot', 'metal', 'bare', 'chested', 'rabid', 'cannibals', 'have', 'taken', 'over', 'planet', 'half', 'expected', 'guy', 'finish', 'up', 'shower', 'advertising', 'body', 'wash', 'deodorant', 'so', 'movie', 'full', 'characters', 'saying', 'doing', 'acting', 'ways', 'seem', 'totally', 'unrealistic', 'Three', 'men', 'have', 'decided', 'go', 'hunting', 'weekend', 'have', 'brought', 'children', 'two', 'are', 'vegetarian', 'who', 'really', 'now', 'think', 'men', 'know', 'hunting', 'then', 'why', 'only', 'one', 'guy', 'actually', 'dressed', 'camo', 'Madsen', 'Forsythe', 'were', 'dressed', 'Madsen', 'British', 'Literature', 'professor', 'Oxford', 'So', 'Forsythe', 'supposed', 'be', 'doctor', 'medical', 'doctor', 'however', 'dresses', 'college', 'English', 'professor', 'have', 'look', 'ill', 'neighbor', 'out', 'thermometer', 'stethoscope', 'high', 'fever', 'then', 'bit', 'rabid', 'granny', 'who', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'hospital', 'week', 'ago', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'just', 'needs', 'stay', 'home', 'bed', 'give', 'dear', 'rabid', 'granny', 'aspirin', 'help', 'take', 'edge', 'fever', 'nope', 'just', 'little', 'sleeping', 'pill', 'Infected', 'cannibal', 'dad', 'rants', 'cell', 'phone', 'smashes', 'computer', 'monitor', 'junk', 'yard', 'tid', 'o', 'biddie', 'hooker', 'forgo', 'pay', 'hour', 'motel', 'area', 'woods', 'right', 'off', 'hiking', 'trail', 'are', 'just', 'scenes', 'movie', 'last', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'do', 'nothing', 'forward', 'inform', 'movie', 'then', 'crappy', 'atmosphere', 'music', 'use', 'try', 'intensify', 'drama', 'action', 'felt', 'was', 'cheesy', 'hair', 'band', 'concert', '1980s', 'Cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'bad.Sadly', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'last', 'half', 'where', 'blacksmith', 'body', 'wash', 'model', 'was', 'going', 'out', 'wilds', 'looking', 'supplies', 'bring', 'back', 'camp', 'survivors', 'sum', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'good', 'zombie', '/', 'infected', 'movie', 'just', 'good', 'idea', 'Sadly', 'low', 'budget', 'not', 'reason', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'have', 'preached', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'zombie', 'movie', 'need', 'put', 'forth', 'effort', 'thought', 'writing', 'script', 'writing', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'developing', 'characters', 'love', 'wanting', 'make', 'decent', 'zombie', 'movie', 'hire', 'writer', 'editor', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'best', 'actors', 'was', 'guy', 'playing', 'hunter', 'actually', 'wore', 'camo', 'hunting', 'weekend', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Madsen', 'character', 'really', 'seemed', 'get', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'probably', 'did', 'own', 'character', 'development', 'Forsythe', 'was', 'just', 'creepy', 'weird', 'Madsen', 'seemed', 'uncomfortable', 'acted', 'awkward', 'mysterious', 'character', 'drank', 'hunted', 'drank', 'ranted', 'drank', 'hunted', 'more', 'drinking', 'guns', 'perfect', 'match', 'hunting', 'weekend', 'Yes', 'Verdi', 'tried', 'only', 'had', 'tried', 'little', 'harder']",N/A

It certainly wasn't great cinema by any means, but I didn't feel like I'd completely wasted an hour and a half of my life after I finished watching it. I have now seen Ciano's follow-up, 2013's Infected, and this time I can say without any hesitation whatsoever that I feel exactly like that. This isn't just the worst movie I've seen this month, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen period. What can you say about a movie that starts out with a voice-over about how the world is plagued by a blood infection that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters, follows that up with a scene of a group of people attempting to defend a cabin from said bloodthirsty monsters, and then within five minutes after that shows a scene of a nerd and a prostitute tramping through the same woods (a scene that seems as if it was added after the rest of the movie was completed because it was lacking any nudity? Yeah, the editing there wasn't the best...) Yeah, it's that bad.Plot, what little there is of it: Louis Hartley (Reservoir Dogs' Michael Madsen) is on a hunting trip with his son Andrew (Tom DeNucci, returning from Inkubus). There's a lot of tension there, but the two of them find themselves united against a common enemy&#8212;an epidemic of infected human beings (think 28 Days Later... here, this movie bears more than a passing resemblance, except that one is actually good) who seem to take offense at the existence of the uninfected anywhere near them.Okay, I have to admit (and note the spoiler alert stop sign at the beginning of this paragraph if you're reading this at var.ev., but I have seen the Big Twist revealed in so many reviews I'm not going to balk at doing it either) that I was kinda-sorta okay with this movie, in that ultra-guilty-pleasure way of &#8220;I can't believe I'm sitting there watching this crap&#8221; until we got to the part where they reveal the reason all these people have gone nutzoid...I actually yelled at the TV. &#8220;LYME DISEASE?&#8221;Yeah, they actually went there.

Louis Hartley (Michael Madsen) and Dr. Edward Dennehey (William Forsythe) are on vacation in cabins of the woods of Connecticut near East Lyme. They are there to bond with their sons... and get some hunting in. We get to meet wives, girlfriends, neighbors, some people in the woods, and the sick granny who bites the doctor (guess where this goes?)There are time consuming scenes of cooking venison steaks on an open flame and washing them down with the local Narragansett beer, topped off by drinking cognac from a screw top bottle (seriously?). The real action doesn't pick up until the film is half over. About 10 minutes from the end, the film is at a point I had wished it would have been 10 minutes from the beginning.This is not a zombie film per se. The infected people can talk, lie, and have periods of remission where they act normal. Severe symptoms vary from the time of infection. It doesn't take a head shot to kill the infected people as they are not undead.One would think a film with metal music, Madsen, and zombie like creatures would rate a full five stars, no questions asked. It moved way too slow and the characters weren't written that well.Parental Guide: F-bombs, near sex, nudity (Kristi Lynn, kickboxing black belt)Safety Note: When working with hot metal as a blacksmith, wear a shirt no matter how cool it looks on the big screen.",3,CAN WE TALK?,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1759,"['film', 'up', 'Madsen', 'narrating', 'cause', 'infection', 'Deer', 'tics', 'birds', 'blood-borne', 'pathogens', 'inevitable', 'Later', 'find', 'out', 'infection', 'mutant', 'strain', 'Lyme', 'disease', 'then', 'get', 'quick', 'scene', 'similar', 'farmhouse', 'attack', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'followed', '12', 'hours', 'earlier', 'reason', 'film', 'build', 'up', 'super', 'slow', 'Louis', 'Hartley', 'Michael', 'Madsen', 'Dr.', 'Edward', 'Dennehey', 'William', 'Forsythe', 'are', 'vacation', 'cabins', 'woods', 'Connecticut', 'East', 'Lyme', 'are', 'there', 'bond', 'sons', 'get', 'hunting', 'get', 'meet', 'wives', 'girlfriends', 'neighbors', 'people', 'woods', 'sick', 'granny', 'who', 'doctor', 'guess', 'where', 'are', 'time', 'consuming', 'scenes', 'cooking', 'venison', 'steaks', 'open', 'flame', 'washing', 'down', 'local', 'Narragansett', 'beer', 'topped', 'off', 'drinking', 'cognac', 'screw', 'top', 'bottle', 'seriously', 'real', 'action', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'film', '10', 'minutes', 'end', 'film', 'point', 'had', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'been', '10', 'minutes', 'beginning.This', 'not', 'zombie', 'film', 'se', 'infected', 'people', 'can', 'talk', 'lie', 'have', 'periods', 'remission', 'where', 'act', 'normal', 'Severe', 'symptoms', 'vary', 'time', 'infection', ""n't"", 'take', 'head', 'shot', 'kill', 'infected', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'undead.One', 'would', 'think', 'film', 'metal', 'music', 'Madsen', 'zombie', 'creatures', 'would', 'rate', 'full', 'five', 'stars', 'questions', 'asked', 'moved', 'way', 'too', 'slow', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'written', 'well.Parental', 'Guide', 'F-bombs', 'near', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Kristi', 'Lynn', 'kickboxing', 'black', 'belt', 'Safety', 'Note', 'When', 'working', 'hot', 'metal', 'blacksmith', 'wear', 'shirt', 'matter', 'how', 'cool', 'big', 'screen']",N/A
