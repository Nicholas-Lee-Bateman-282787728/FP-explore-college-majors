Their caretaker (Maggie) is amazing. She may get paid for the job, but I think she would also do it without the money. I love that Roger, JP and Miguel are from different races and are best friends/brothers. It is heartwarming to see them together. I used to watch Tony Danza's Who's The Boss with my older sister, so it is nice to see him in this film. Danny Glover is also an amazing actor, and I love that he is portrayed positively as an African-American/'black' American actor. I also love the rest of the cast because they are amazing. Some scenes are funny, some are sad, and others are inbetween. As in real life, this movie has its ups and downs. It's an amazing film, and I love it so much. It's good for all ages.

368941,AMGZGF7MYDMZP,6303315305,"Addison Cooper ""Adoption Social Worker""","[6, 7]","Roger and JP are in Maggie's foster home. They're unrelated boys who have become close friends while staying with Maggie. 7-ish JP tags along with 10-ish Roger to nearby Angel Stadium to watch some games, and Roger prays for Divine intervention, believing that an offhanded comment by his father ensures that his family will reunite if the Angels win the American League pennant.Roger and his father never reunite, but Roger and JP end the movie excited about a promised placement, together, with a prospective adoptive father. This movie could be a good choice for pre-teens and young teens in foster care, if they can get past the cheesy scenes where angels (the Heaven ones, not the California ones) manipulate baseball games. The movie touches on a lot of experiences that kids in foster care sometimes experience: kids they come to care about get moved from the foster home on short notice; expectations of birth family members are sometimes disappointingly unfulfilled; Court appointments interrupt your life. The movie is not without flaws, but it does have some powerful moments and could serve as a powerful conversation starter.",4,"From a Foster Care Perspective: Not a Grand Slam, but at least a Bloop Single",1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,1138,"['Roger', 'JP', 'are', 'Maggie', 'foster', 'home', ""'re"", 'unrelated', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'close', 'friends', 'staying', 'Maggie', '7-ish', 'JP', 'tags', '10-ish', 'Roger', 'nearby', 'Angel', 'Stadium', 'watch', 'games', 'Roger', 'prays', 'Divine', 'intervention', 'believing', 'offhanded', 'comment', 'father', 'family', 'will', 'reunite', 'Angels', 'win', 'American', 'League', 'pennant.Roger', 'father', 'never', 'reunite', 'Roger', 'JP', 'end', 'movie', 'excited', 'promised', 'placement', 'together', 'prospective', 'adoptive', 'father', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'pre-teens', 'young', 'teens', 'foster', 'care', 'can', 'get', 'cheesy', 'scenes', 'where', 'angels', 'Heaven', 'ones', 'not', 'California', 'ones', 'manipulate', 'baseball', 'games', 'movie', 'touches', 'lot', 'experiences', 'kids', 'foster', 'care', 'sometimes', 'experience', 'kids', 'come', 'care', 'get', 'moved', 'foster', 'home', 'short', 'notice', 'expectations', 'birth', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'sometimes', 'disappointingly', 'unfulfilled', 'Court', 'interrupt', 'life', 'movie', 'not', 'flaws', 'have', 'powerful', 'moments', 'could', 'serve', 'powerful', 'conversation', 'starter']",Angels in the Outfield VHS
368942,A1SQFUCSPMUE8I,6303315305,ALF,"[0, 2]","&quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot; is a charming family film from Disney, certainly one of their better live-action productions. The story's premise is somewhat silly - a boy wishes that the Angels will win the pennant so that his father will take care of him again and he can leave his foster home. Nonetheless, it's perfectly-executed, in the style of '90s Disney films that work (such as Man of the House, Jungle 2 Jungle, Cool Runnings).&quot;Angels&quot; blends comedy and drama without ever feeling like either element is forced. Kudos must go to the cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does an apt job in his starring role as Roger, and Danny Glover puts energy and heart into his performance as Angels manager George Knox. Christopher Lloyd is wired to comedic effect, as usual. Tony Danza is compassionate as a troubled, aging pitcher. Supporting cast does well, also - Milton Davis Jr. is likable as Roger's friend J.P., and Tony Longo provides some comic power. You'll also recognize some faces that have gone on to get lead work in a number of notable films, including Matthew McConaughey, Neal McDonough (TV's &quot;Boomtown&quot;) and Adrien Brody.Cynical audiences will surely find fault with the moralistic and uplifting tale of a last place team working their way to the top with some divine intervention. The rest of us will enjoy a very fun movie that is solid family viewing.The DVD just barely makes it to first base. The good: the film is presented in widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital. The bad: the transfer is a direct port of the laserdisc, not enhanced for 16x9 televisions, and not as sharp or clear as you'd hope. Worst of all, after waiting for several years for the film to come to DVD - there's not a single extra feature. Not even the memorable theatrical trailer. More effort should have gone into the DVD presentation for this wonderful family film.Nonetheless, it's appropriately low-priced, and the movie is a home run.

Erland,"[1, 1]","In an attempt to repeat the magic and financial success they had with `The Mighty Ducks' (92) two years previously, Disney turned their attention to major league baseball and the hometown Angels. Deciding to do a remake of the '51 film `Angels in the Outfield' which starred Paul Douglas they had all they needed available right from the beginning; a tried and true storyline to work from and access to a local, professional baseball team. What could make things more perfect? Well how about the fact that the team in question just happened to be named the Angels fitting perfectly into the title and theme of the proposed film! Ahh..., the genius of the Disney machine is a beautiful thing to observe isn't it?The end result of their endeavors, `Angels in the Outfield' is definitely a kid friendly film that the whole family can not only enjoy but the wise parent may even be able to use some aspects of the storyline as ""teachable moments"" with their children. Maybe a conversation on the plight of the orphan and the importance of parenting might be in order, or on a more personal, human potential level how confidence in yourself and your own abilities can lead to miraculous achievements? if you're more spiritually oriented you may wish to use the film to initiate a discussion on the existence and function of angels and the role of faith? One that immediately comes to mind is the warning that smoking is hazardous to your health (remember at the end when Al (Christopher Lloyd) the boss angel informs Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) that one of the players will be playing for the REAL Angels soon due to his twenty year smoking habit). Leave it to Disney to not only entertain, but instruct (I hope you realize I'm being facetious).",3,"""Championships Have To Be Won On There Own, It's A Rule""",1225670400,"11 3, 2008",2008,1741,"['attempt', 'repeat', 'magic', 'financial', 'success', 'had', 'Mighty', 'Ducks', '92', 'two', 'years', 'previously', 'Disney', 'turned', 'attention', 'major', 'league', 'baseball', 'hometown', 'Angels', 'Deciding', 'do', 'remake', ""'51"", 'film', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'starred', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'had', 'needed', 'available', 'right', 'beginning', 'tried', 'true', 'storyline', 'work', 'access', 'local', 'professional', 'baseball', 'team', 'What', 'could', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'perfect', 'Well', 'how', 'fact', 'team', 'question', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'named', 'Angels', 'fitting', 'perfectly', 'title', 'theme', 'proposed', 'film', 'Ahh', 'genius', 'Disney', 'machine', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'observe', ""n't"", 'end', 'result', 'endeavors', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'definitely', 'kid', 'friendly', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'enjoy', 'wise', 'parent', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'aspects', 'storyline', 'teachable', 'moments', 'children', 'Maybe', 'conversation', 'plight', 'orphan', 'importance', 'parenting', 'might', 'be', 'order', 'more', 'personal', 'human', 'potential', 'level', 'how', 'confidence', 'own', 'abilities', 'can', 'lead', 'miraculous', 'achievements', ""'re"", 'more', 'spiritually', 'oriented', 'may', 'wish', 'use', 'film', 'initiate', 'discussion', 'existence', 'function', 'angels', 'role', 'faith', 'One', 'immediately', 'mind', 'warning', 'smoking', 'hazardous', 'health', 'remember', 'end', 'when', 'Al', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'boss', 'angel', 'informs', 'Roger', 'Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'one', 'players', 'will', 'be', 'playing', 'REAL', 'Angels', 'soon', 'due', 'twenty', 'year', 'smoking', 'habit', 'Leave', 'Disney', 'not', 'only', 'entertain', 'instruct', 'hope', 'realize', ""'m"", 'being', 'facetious']",Angels in the Outfield VHS

The Angels are losing, but Roger sees an angel behind the ball-players who have the best plays. He eventually convinces the manager to put certain players into the game. His choices seem to be the players who have not proven themselves all year. The ball game announcer mocks the decisions but is amazed as they perform the most unusual outstanding maneuvers which turns the luck of the team into winners. Knox, the manager, is finally convinced that Roger sees something and reluctantly follows his suggestions which keeps the Angels on a winning streak.Both Roger and JP are foster-children of Maggie. Soon after one of the children in the foster home has been adopted, Roger goes for a custody hearing. There he discovers his own dad does not want him. Roger is given to the state of California for custody. Roger's hearing takes place on the day of a crucial game. He can not make it and without his help the Angels lose. Nonetheless, the Angels made it to the World Series. Knox is worried since he lost the previous game whether or not his team can win. It turns out Roger meets the head angel-in-the-outfield who lets him in on a secret, Mel Clark, the pitcher has cancer and only 6 months left to live, however he does not know it yet. It turns out that the Angels playing in the World Series are not permitted to receive help from the angels-in-the-outfield. The ball players must win this one on their own power ...Needless to say, one can guess the ending ... However, the plot thickens, as the announcer of the ball game suspects some trick in the Angels winning streak. He tells the newspapers that the manager believes their winning streak is due to divine intervention, in the form of angels. Due to this revelation, the owner of the team wants to fire the manager. Just when Knox intends to announce his resignation at a news conference, there is an unexpected turn of events. The ball players stick together and each stands up declaring, if the manager leaves so will they. The team goes on to win the World Series and the foster children reeive a big surprise, too. They are adopted by an unlikely ""father"". This story will touch the heart of children and adults alike. It is a ""feel good"" story filled with poignant moments and heart-warming results.

This movie was made for $24 million & made $50 million in The US directed by William Dear this has been the only movie of his I've seen he's done a lot of TV work. It stars Danny Glover as George Knox, Christopher Lloyd as Al, Tony Danza as Mel Clark, Joseph Gordon Levitt as Roger, Milton Davis Jr as JP, Jay O Sanders as Ranch Wilder, Brenda Fricker as Maggie Nelson & Taylor Nergon as David. The story is about these 2 kids named Roger & JP both of who lost their Mothers & are taken care of by this Foster Mother named Maggie both boys are fans of The Angels Roger's Dad comes to visit he has no way to take care of him Roger asks him when they will be a Family again his Dad says ""From where I'm sitting when The Angels win The Pennant."" The Angels are on a losing streak like I said they're both big fans of The Angels they even watch a game from a tree until they're caught by Security. Anyway The Angels lose the game & they're chewed out by Coach George Knox & you have Neal McDonough he's a Pitcher that's not very bright & Danny Glover calls him a jack a  *  * which I like cause Neal McDonough is a bad actor. Roger prays that The Angels become a winning team & make it to The Pennant. You're introduced Mel Clark who used to be a great Pitcher he used to play in Cincinnati & George Knox happened to be his Coach & Manger there but he blew his arm out & was traded to The Angels & Knox doesn't play all that much. During this game actual Angels show up & helps the team win only Roger can see & nobody else he tries to tell JP about as well as this drunk fan played by Matthew I Baker he was actually funny. You're introduced to Al The Boss Angel as well there's this commentator named Ranch Wilder who just bad mouths The Angels. JP has a winning ticket to get his picture taken with George Knox but JP is shy so he gives it Roger. Roger tells Knox says ""Great a psycho kid you'd think they screen these people?"" This sets up George Knox becoming a Father for JP & Roger he has them come to the games & he has this guy named David escort them & they give him a hard time like JP accidentally squirts mustard on him he needs something to clean it off he asks for Soda JP's like ""I got soda."" He pours it in his lap as well when JP leaves his Nacho's in a seat & David sets on them JP calls this poor old boy Nacho But  t which was my thoughts exactly. Knox has a temper & cusses a lot Roger tells him not to cuss cause The Angels might not show up. So when he tells all the players not to swear 1 player says ""That eliminates half the speech from the team."" Roger sees an Angel with 1 of the players which happens to be Adrien Brody & thankfully he didn't have a larger role cause I don't care for him as an actor either. Roger tells Knox to play him even though he's the teams worst hitter. Which thanks to The Angel he hits the ball & gets to home plate. You know Coach Knox is going to take them home but JP gets car sick cause he lived in a car with his Mom. When they get home you find out this older boy they lived with has been placed in a Foster Home which upsets JP & he runs off & cries which I didn't get cause that boy Miguel was mean to JP. Anyway at the next game Roger sees an Angel with Mel Clark he tells Coach Knox to play him even though he hasn't started a game in the entire decade. The Angels helps Clark throw a really good pitch & Neal McDonough tells Coach Knox it was an amazing pitch Knox was about to say youd  @  ** right but stops himself & says you darn right. Which Clark helps them in defeating The Detroit Tigers. Things get better for The Angels word gets around fast of their turn around attendance has gone up for games. Then you have Roger who has to go to court  so he can't be at a game meaning no Angels & Roger finds out that his Dad can't take care of him which I felt bad for Roger cause he's a kid he really believed that if The Angels won The Pennant then he could be with his Dad. The Angels lose to The White Sox JP is upset & crying he talks to Ranch Wilder he tells him that Roger wasn't here he tells him that he can see Angels & that he gives Knox advice which Ranch Wilder uses this tos  crew George Knox over. Knox tells Roger that he knows what it's like not to have a Father to be there for him then there's this Press Conference held by The Owner Of The Angels Hank Murphy cause he wants Knox to explain the stuff about The Angels instead of reading a prepared statement he just comes from the heart. You even have Maggie speak up & takes Coach Knox & Roger's side the whole team stands up for him & Murphy allows Knox to continue as Manager. You get to The Division Final where The Angels is going to take on The White Sox  for the last Knox has Clark pitch most of the game Mitchell hits a Home Run which helps out. Al shows up he tells Roger that they can't interfere in a Championship Game he also tells Roger that Mel Clark will die in 6 months cause he is a chain smoker. That is an emotional scene you know I can't do it justice. Clark isn't throwing isn't throwing his best but the rest of the team catches the balls. You have another great scene where The Angels almost have it won Knox goes to Clark & Clark thinks that he's going to take him out of the game Ranch Wilder is being a jerk on commentary & he says it's about time. Clark admits defeat he says he's got nothing left Knox tells him he does he's got 1 more strike left. I don't care if it's cheesy or not this is a great scene where Roger does this flapping gesture & then everybody gets into it Knox says ""Go get em for The Championship!"" They show where The Owner turns off his radio cause he's sick & tired of Ranch Wilder's commentary putting down the team. Then have Clark throw out the ball The Batter hits it but then Clark catches it before anything is done & The Angels win The Pennant Murphy fires Ranch Wilder which was awesome. When they get back home they're excited to tell Maggie that The Angels won & she tells him that Roger Social Worker called & there's a home for Roger which sends JP off crying Knox tells Roger the person that called his Social Worker it was him he's going to be his Father but he can't cause Roger doesn't want to leave JP behind Knox tells him that he's going to JP's Father too. JP sees Al outside the window he says he knew it could happen. Al says were always watching as he fly's off. Angels In The Outfield is really good movie of course I had characters that I care about the plot is good & the directed by William Dear is great. Danny Glover was great. Tony Danza did a very good Christopher Lloyd was good. Joesph Gordon Levitt did a really good job. Milton Davis Jr was good. Ben Johnson was good. Jay O Sanders did a good job. Taylor Nergon was pretty good. So if you grew up with this movie & haven't seen it in a long time I can recommend it & I can recommend it even more if you have kids & family movie for you all to watch.

This movie reminds you that all things happen for a reason, even if you can't see it right away, it shows the value of beleiving, and it restores your faith in people.The cast is very well chosen.  All of the characters are well established, with very definite personalities, and all of the actors step up and fill their shoes nicely.  Your heart will be touched a thousand times over during the course of this movie.  You'll laugh, and you'll cry, and when the movie's over you'll feel like maybe the world is a little bit better place.The film is greatly suited for children, as it doesn't involve the sort of foul humour that so many movies do now.  It's just good old fashioned fun, as any baseball movie should be.  There IS a heavy dose of morals in the mix.  Beyond the over-all theme of believing in yourself, and having faith that God has a greater plan, the film also touches on the dangers of smoking, and how unnecessary profanity is.Many scenes in this movie are truly beautiful and inspiring.  Everytime the crowd stands up to flap their arms in support of Mel Clark (Tony Danza) I can't help but shed a tear, and when Roger's prayers are answered and he gets a family my heart melts all over again.This movie is truly among the most uplifting of children's movies.",5,"Sentimental, Touching, and Sure to Make You Smile",1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,1370,"['true', 'movie', 'high', 'quantity', 'cheeziness', 'case', 'movie', 'things', 'happen', 'reason', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'right', 'away', 'value', 'beleiving', 'faith', 'people.The', 'cast', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'established', 'very', 'definite', 'personalities', 'actors', 'step', 'up', 'fill', 'shoes', 'nicely', 'heart', 'will', 'be', 'touched', 'thousand', 'times', 'course', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'laugh', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'when', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'maybe', 'world', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'place.The', 'film', 'greatly', 'suited', 'children', ""n't"", 'involve', 'sort', 'foul', 'humour', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'do', 'now', 'just', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'fun', 'baseball', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'heavy', 'dose', 'morals', 'mix', 'over-all', 'theme', 'believing', 'having', 'faith', 'God', 'greater', 'plan', 'film', 'also', 'dangers', 'smoking', 'how', 'unnecessary', 'profanity', 'is.Many', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'inspiring', 'Everytime', 'crowd', 'up', 'flap', 'arms', 'support', 'Mel', 'Clark', 'Tony', 'Danza', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'shed', 'tear', 'when', 'Roger', 'prayers', 'are', 'answered', 'family', 'heart', 'melts', 'again.This', 'movie', 'truly', 'most', 'uplifting', 'children', 'movies']",Angels in the Outfield VHS

Imagine explaining to your child that the very reason he didn't win was because there were no angels there to help his or her team...I suppose all that wasn't the point, however.

The cynical amazon review talks about the effects  heavy side of the film, but I guess I must have seen another film, since I thought that the material was treated with respect, and done as unobtrusively as you can possibly do with the appearance of Angels.The cast is excellent, and I feel that this film works in a great way, not simply because it is a Disney film. Forget the comments that slate this film as cheezy, or sugary... it is just plain wonderful.The brief appearance of the kid's Dad is memorable in retrospect, since it is played by the actor who also appears in ABOUT  SCHMIDT, and does a wonderful job there as well.Danny Glover fills an absolutely brilliant role as the coach, and eventually fills bigger shoes in the lives of the two main children.Tony Danza plays a very accessable role as a ""has-been"" pitcher, who is given one final moment of glory thanks to the magic of the Angels, and the intercession of the young child  lead ( you can see why when you watch the film).

""Angels in the Outfield"", for a change, strikes exactly the right chord between emotion, humor, and just plain fun that makes a joy to watch again and again.Here's the basic plot: A young orphan named Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promised by his deadbeat Dad that the family will come together again when the downtrodden California Angels baseball team wins the pennant.  After a heartfelt prayer from Roger on that very matter, he begins to see a swarm of angels, led by the enigmatic ""AL"" (Christopher Lloyd), helping the team finally start to move up in the standings.  The Angels' manager, Mr. Knox (Danny Glover), begins to take a liking to young Roger, first viewing him as a good luck charm, then starting to believe in the magic surrounding the team.What I really find charming about this film comes in two different areas: First, the humor doesn't pander to the kiddies.  I'm in my twenties and, though being a baseball nut helps this process, can still laugh out loud at many moments throughout the movie.  Also, the message is just heartfelt enough to resonate with me emotionally, but not overly done to feel sickening.The acting is terrific all the way around, as the kids, players, manager, and even all the auxiliary performers shine in whatever capacity they are given.  The sport of baseball is known for harboring some colorful characters, and this film doesn't spare you from that aspect of the game!Thus, I consider ""Angels In The Outfield"" to be one of the best family films I have ever seen.
