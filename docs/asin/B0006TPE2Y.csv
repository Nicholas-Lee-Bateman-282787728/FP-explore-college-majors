It has sooo many interesting and fun moves that you don't even feel like you are working out! I look forward to doing it regularly.  The background is beautiful, Hilary's voice is soothing and the work out will kick your butt.  You will get into positions that you haven't since elementary school.  I feel more flexible than my 13 year old daughter! You will be amazed at your core strength. LOVE it!  I would buy ANY new dvd that she comes out with...I trust her.",5,One of the best out there,1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,506,"['one', 'favorite', 'pilates', 'dvds', 'sooo', 'many', 'interesting', 'fun', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'feel', 'are', 'working', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', 'regularly', 'background', 'beautiful', 'Hilary', 'voice', 'soothing', 'work', 'out', 'will', 'kick', 'butt', 'will', 'get', 'positions', 'have', ""n't"", 'elementary', 'school', 'feel', 'more', 'flexible', '13', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'core', 'strength', 'LOVE', 'would', 'buy', 'ANY', 'new', 'dvd', 'out', 'trust']",N/A

So, you never feel like you are working. The hardest part of this video is keeping up with her change of poses. I am a strong person, and like a challenge. There was no physical challenge to this video.",1,Greatly disappointed,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",2010,324,"['video', '22', 'minutes', 'Hilary', 'one', 'pilates', 'pose', 'next', 'seconds', 'do', 'pose', '2-4', 'reps', 'So', 'never', 'feel', 'are', 'working', 'hardest', 'part', 'video', 'keeping', 'up', 'change', 'poses', 'am', 'strong', 'person', 'challenge', 'was', 'physical', 'challenge', 'video']",N/A
874173,A3CWZQIBTUANQE,B0006TPE2Y,J. L. Twardowski,"[1, 1]","I bought this DVD a few years ago because I was no longer living in a location where there were Pilates classes available.  Or, well, there were Pilates classes available but I felt like they were all very beginner level and I had little to benefit from because I was doing many advanced moves in my class.  I wanted something to help me maintain my practice.The good side about this DVD is that it did, in fact, have all of the movements I was hoping to find.  All of the moves I had been doing in my class.  However... the bad side is that it is too ridiculously fast.  It's like she's in a race or something.  It's like I hardly got into the one move and she's flipping around to the next already.  And, sometimes it wasn't just how fast she'd switch but the number of reps.  I really like doing more reps of the movement and staying with it longer than she does.Like, I'm not even kidding you -- all the moves she does in this video I did in my 50 minute pilates class at the gym.  Imagine fitting all those advanced moves of a 50 minute class, take out the warm up and cool down, and jam it all into 20 minutes -- that's what this video is.Needless to say, I think I've only used the DVD like twice.  Sometimes I'd only use it to be reminded of the moves and then just do it on my own and on my own pace... which is fine, but still not what I'd prefer to do if I had the choice.",2,Not what I expected,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1383,"['bought', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'living', 'location', 'where', 'were', 'Pilates', 'classes', 'available', 'well', 'were', 'Pilates', 'classes', 'available', 'felt', 'were', 'very', 'beginner', 'level', 'had', 'little', 'benefit', 'was', 'doing', 'many', 'advanced', 'moves', 'class', 'wanted', 'something', 'help', 'maintain', 'practice.The', 'good', 'side', 'DVD', 'did', 'fact', 'have', 'movements', 'was', 'hoping', 'find', 'moves', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'class', 'However', 'bad', 'side', 'too', 'ridiculously', 'fast', 'race', 'something', 'hardly', 'got', 'one', 'move', 'flipping', 'around', 'next', 'already', 'sometimes', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'how', 'fast', ""'d"", 'switch', 'number', 'reps', 'really', 'doing', 'more', 'reps', 'movement', 'staying', 'longer', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'kidding', 'moves', 'video', 'did', '50', 'minute', 'pilates', 'class', 'gym', 'Imagine', 'fitting', 'advanced', 'moves', '50', 'minute', 'class', 'take', 'out', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'jam', '20', 'minutes', 'what', 'video', 'is.Needless', 'say', 'think', ""'ve"", 'only', 'used', 'DVD', 'twice', 'Sometimes', ""'d"", 'only', 'use', 'be', 'reminded', 'moves', 'then', 'just', 'do', 'own', 'own', 'pace', 'fine', 'still', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'prefer', 'do', 'had', 'choice']",N/A

This workout is 20 plus minutes long and packs a lot of exercises in a short amount of time.  You move from one exercise to the other very quickly.  The exercises you will see in this routine are the hundred, rollup, rollover, single leg circles, rolling like a ball, single and double leg stretch, scissors, double leg lower lift, twist, spine stretch, open leg rocker, corkscrew, saw, swan dive, single and double leg kick, neck pull, scissors (advanced), bicycle, shoulder bridge, spine twist, jackknife, high bridge, side kick series, teasers, hip circles, swimming, leg pull front, leg pull, kneeling side kicks, sidebends, twist I & II, boomerang, seal, crab, rocking, control balance and pushups.  There are few reps for each exercise and literally no rest or stopping in between.I like Hilary as an instructor, here she instructs as a voiceover which I normally don't care for but it doesn't bother me here.  I  would think it would be pretty tough to call and cue the moves while doing them.  She makes the moves look effortless too, I was impressed with her, plus I like her style.This video is far too advanced for me, but would be a good choice for those who practice pilates that are looking for a challenge.  Hilary's intermediate video is another good choice for those not quite ready for this one.",4,Definitely for advanced pilates students...,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,1446,"['sure', 'am', 'not', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'challenging', 'fast', 'paced', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'workout', 'advanced', 'pilates', 'workout', '20', 'minutes', 'long', 'lot', 'exercises', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'move', 'one', 'exercise', 'other', 'very', 'quickly', 'exercises', 'will', 'see', 'routine', 'are', 'hundred', 'rollup', 'rollover', 'single', 'leg', 'circles', 'rolling', 'ball', 'single', 'double', 'leg', 'stretch', 'scissors', 'double', 'leg', 'lower', 'lift', 'twist', 'spine', 'stretch', 'open', 'leg', 'rocker', 'corkscrew', 'saw', 'swan', 'dive', 'single', 'double', 'leg', 'kick', 'pull', 'scissors', 'advanced', 'bicycle', 'shoulder', 'bridge', 'spine', 'twist', 'jackknife', 'high', 'bridge', 'side', 'kick', 'series', 'teasers', 'hip', 'circles', 'swimming', 'pull', 'front', 'leg', 'pull', 'kneeling', 'side', 'kicks', 'sidebends', 'twist', 'II', 'boomerang', 'seal', 'crab', 'rocking', 'control', 'balance', 'pushups', 'are', 'few', 'reps', 'exercise', 'literally', 'rest', 'stopping', 'between.I', 'like', 'Hilary', 'instructor', 'here', 'voiceover', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', ""n't"", 'bother', 'here', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'tough', 'call', 'cue', 'moves', 'doing', 'moves', 'look', 'effortless', 'too', 'was', 'impressed', 'like', 'style.This', 'video', 'far', 'too', 'advanced', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'who', 'practice', 'pilates', 'are', 'looking', 'challenge', 'Hilary', 'intermediate', 'video', 'good', 'choice', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'one']",N/A
874175,A5R7DIRMYKFC9,B0006TPE2Y,Vic,"[0, 0]",This is a very high paced workout that goes through each exercise too quickly.  It made me sweat but not feel the burn of a good workout.  I think she does well talking you through each exercise but maybe if reps were increased it would be more effective.  Not what I expected at all for an advanced workout.  I did the ten minute solution tighten in tone pilates right after I was done to make a more effective workout.,2,to fast,1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,420,"['very', 'high', 'paced', 'exercise', 'too', 'quickly', 'made', 'sweat', 'not', 'feel', 'burn', 'good', 'workout', 'think', 'well', 'talking', 'exercise', 'maybe', 'reps', 'were', 'increased', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'effective', 'Not', 'what', 'expected', 'advanced', 'workout', 'did', 'ten', 'minute', 'solution', 'tighten', 'tone', 'pilates', 'right', 'was', 'done', 'make', 'more', 'effective', 'workout']",N/A
