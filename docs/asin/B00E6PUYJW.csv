1665040,A1WVA7V02PQOY6,B00E6PUYJW,Dad of Divas,"[8, 12]","This delightful collection of new holiday movies arrived in time for a weekend of watching movies. These are original movies brought to the public through the collection.The four movies as mentioned above were titled: THE CHRISTMAS CONSULTANT, HOLIDAY SPIN, THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS, AND HOLLY'S HOLIDAY. The various topics of each one I found interesting and entertaining too.I will review two of the movies in this report.The first one is THE CHRISTMAS CONSULTANT starring David Hasseloff and Caroline Rhea. Caroline's character is under a lot of stress: moving her family to a new location, a new job, the holidays are just around the corner, and not only are family members arriving but her boss insists on a Christmas party in which a new client will attend. David 's character comes to the rescue with decorating the house, baking, getting everyone involved in Christmas, and basically taking over the holiday. As the family enjoys Christmas ,Caroline's character feels even more stress until she shows her anger and frustration.The movie reminds us how our family and love for our family are the most important aspects of the holiday. Spending time with our family and friends is builds more memories than all the glitter and sparkle, the gifts and the fancy decorations.The second movie was THE MARCH SISTERS AT CHRISTMAS. This movie is a contemporary take on LITTLE WOMEN. The sisters find our that their parents want to downsize to a smaller home and they move out. The sisters are determined to renovate their childhood home.By sticking together, working side by side, and finding others who will help with their huge undertaking, they complete their renovation in time for Christmas. In between the work on the house the women have their careers to explore, there are some complications with men they love, and they find joy and happiness with each other in spite of their individual differences which is of course what makes a family so interesting.*I received a copy of this for review - all opinions are my own*",5,A Great Holiday DVD,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,2032,"['delightful', 'collection', 'new', 'holiday', 'movies', 'arrived', 'time', 'weekend', 'watching', 'movies', 'are', 'original', 'movies', 'brought', 'public', 'collection.The', 'four', 'movies', 'mentioned', 'were', 'titled', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CONSULTANT', 'HOLIDAY', 'SPIN', 'THE', 'MARCH', 'SISTERS', 'AT', 'CHRISTMAS', 'AND', 'HOLLY', 'HOLIDAY', 'various', 'topics', 'one', 'found', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'too.I', 'will', 'review', 'two', 'movies', 'report.The', 'first', 'one', 'THE', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CONSULTANT', 'starring', 'David', 'Hasseloff', 'Caroline', 'Rhea', 'Caroline', 'character', 'lot', 'stress', 'moving', 'family', 'new', 'location', 'new', 'job', 'holidays', 'are', 'just', 'corner', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'family', 'members', 'arriving', 'boss', 'Christmas', 'party', 'new', 'client', 'will', 'attend', 'David', 'character', 'rescue', 'decorating', 'house', 'baking', 'getting', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Christmas', 'basically', 'taking', 'over', 'holiday', 'family', 'Christmas', 'Caroline', 'character', 'feels', 'even', 'more', 'stress', 'anger', 'frustration.The', 'movie', 'how', 'family', 'love', 'family', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'aspects', 'holiday', 'Spending', 'time', 'family', 'friends', 'builds', 'more', 'memories', 'glitter', 'sparkle', 'gifts', 'fancy', 'decorations.The', 'second', 'movie', 'was', 'THE', 'MARCH', 'SISTERS', 'AT', 'CHRISTMAS', 'movie', 'contemporary', 'take', 'LITTLE', 'WOMEN', 'sisters', 'find', 'parents', 'want', 'downsize', 'smaller', 'home', 'move', 'out', 'sisters', 'are', 'determined', 'renovate', 'childhood', 'home.By', 'sticking', 'together', 'working', 'side', 'side', 'finding', 'others', 'who', 'will', 'help', 'huge', 'undertaking', 'complete', 'renovation', 'time', 'Christmas', 'work', 'house', 'women', 'have', 'careers', 'explore', 'are', 'complications', 'men', 'love', 'find', 'joy', 'happiness', 'other', 'spite', 'individual', 'differences', 'course', 'what', 'family', 'so', 'interesting', '*I', 'received', 'copy', 'review', 'opinions', 'are', 'own*']",Lifetime Holiday 4-Film Collection: (The Christmas Consultant/Holiday Spin/The March Sisters At Christmas/Holly's Holiday)
1665041,A2N8AFQV49WYJI,B00E6PUYJW,"Don't tread on me ""Defending the Conservative...","[0, 0]","This was purchased for The Christmas Consultant.  David Hasslehoff plays such a loveable flake in it.  It is funny and has a touching side to it too.  Caroline Rea plays the overworked, stressed-out mom perfectly.  It really is a good one for the whole familyHoliday Spin with Ralph Macchio (yes, the Karate Kid) was the pleasant surprise.  I missed it when it was on television being unsure I wanted to watch it.  It is also another good Christmas story.  A bit predictable, but it doesn't ruin the movie.  While it is generally a good movie for the whole family, there is a fight scene that you may want to skip for the sake of younger children.  Over all, it was a another good addition to our Christmas movie collection.I have yet to watch the other two movies on the disc.  These first two made the purchase well worth it.
