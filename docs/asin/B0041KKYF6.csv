1381105,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B0041KKYF6,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[5, 7]","Nominated for Oscar's Best Actor in 2010 for his gritty character Uxbal, Javier Bardem never fails to disappoint, but the Oscar went to Colin Firth for theThe King's Speech.  The film was nominated for Best Foreign Film, but lost to Denmark'sIn A Better World.If you feel depressed with this film as some people have, then the director has done his job.  You can't possibly feel good, with death looming and the thought of a father leaving his two children to an uncertain dismal world.Uxbal, separated from his wife, an alcoholic, bipolar with other psychological hang-ups that include whoring around.  He is a middle man for the crime world, the black market streets of Spain.  He supports two young children in a slum-like apartment building.  When he finds out he has prostate cancer, with months to live, he wants to do good for what he has become.  He loves his children, but fears the thought of leaving his children to practically nobody, as their  mother is a sad, pathetic and abusive.With just over two hours, this film reaches its intended mark, to make the viewer feel for a man dying and leaving behind his beloved children.  There is nothing pretty here, from the exploitative treatment of illegal cheap labor, making knockoffs in pitiful working conditions, sleeping on dirty mattresses in a cold warehouse.  What one sees is the gritty, dark and seedy streets of Spain and the corruption up against death and love for family.This is excellent storyline, well done, and brilliant performances by Javier Bardem and  Maricel Alvarez, who plays his messed up wife, Maramba.  ......Rizzo",5,"Gritty, sad...two worlds of a dying man",1317513600,"10 2, 2011",2011,1599,"['Nominated', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', '2010', 'gritty', 'character', 'Uxbal', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'never', 'disappoint', 'Oscar', 'went', 'Colin', 'Firth', 'theThe', 'King', 'Speech', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'lost', ""Denmark'sIn"", 'A', 'Better', 'World.If', 'feel', 'depressed', 'film', 'people', 'have', 'then', 'director', 'done', 'job', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'feel', 'good', 'death', 'looming', 'thought', 'father', 'leaving', 'two', 'children', 'uncertain', 'dismal', 'world.Uxbal', 'separated', 'wife', 'alcoholic', 'bipolar', 'other', 'psychological', 'hang-ups', 'include', 'whoring', 'around', 'middle', 'man', 'crime', 'world', 'black', 'market', 'streets', 'Spain', 'two', 'young', 'children', 'slum-like', 'apartment', 'building', 'When', 'out', 'prostate', 'cancer', 'months', 'live', 'do', 'good', 'what', 'become', 'children', 'thought', 'leaving', 'children', 'practically', 'nobody', 'mother', 'sad', 'pathetic', 'abusive.With', 'just', 'two', 'hours', 'film', 'intended', 'mark', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'man', 'dying', 'leaving', 'beloved', 'children', 'nothing', 'pretty', 'here', 'exploitative', 'treatment', 'illegal', 'cheap', 'labor', 'making', 'knockoffs', 'pitiful', 'working', 'conditions', 'sleeping', 'dirty', 'mattresses', 'cold', 'warehouse', 'What', 'one', 'gritty', 'dark', 'seedy', 'streets', 'Spain', 'corruption', 'up', 'death', 'love', 'family.This', 'excellent', 'storyline', 'well', 'done', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Maricel', 'Alvarez', 'who', 'messed', 'up', 'wife', 'Maramba', 'Rizzo']",N/A

He is such a good actor!I am giving this film four stars and not five because I honestly did not like the way I felt after viewing this film. I felt such a sense of hopelessness and despair. I guess I should give it five stars for how incredible this movie was at invoking so much emotion in me. People who want to view a movie that ends with a glimmer of hope should avoid this film. This movie didn't make me shed tears, it's not a tearjerker but rather a 'leave you apathetic and hopeless - you hope never to have a life like this guy' type of movie.I found it a bit odd that a fairly young man Uxbal was dying of prostate cancer. I am not sure of his age but assuming he is in his forties, it is very rare for a man to have stage four prostate cancer. But then again, perhaps that was supposed to add to yet another one of his short ""end of the sticks"" which he seemed to suffer in abundance in this film. His (ex)wife is a mess, his brother is sleeping with his wife, he is threatened on a daily basis with his illegal 'job', he lives in poverty, he has two mouths to feed and then is told he has just a couple months to live.In spite of his underground/illicit lifestyle he is a man with a good heart. He cares about his children, his friends and family and tries hard to be a man of his word.I'm glad I saw this film and Javier was excellent. But it is not a movie that I would buy or watch again.

1381109,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B0041KKYF6,Andy Orrock,"[6, 11]","I'd pay to watch Javier Bardem read a phone book.  I have the utmost respect for him as an actor.  I have made it a point to catch every one of his new releases on the big screen since his US breakthrough in Julian Schnabel's excellent film,Before Night Falls.  So, ""Biutiful"" was a natural 'must see' for me.That said, I blow hot and cold about Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.  While no doubt extraordinarily talented, his films can be overwrought.  InBabelin particular, He. Tried. So. Hard. To. Say. Something. Meaningful.  I did like21 Grams, but only because of the awesome performances from Naomi Watts and Melissa Leo.  And, when I saw the posters for Biutiful, the first thing I noticed was ""A film by I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.""  Only one guy gets away with that:  Almod&oacute;var.  Anyone else gets a eye roll and a snicker.I came down somewhere in the middle on 'Biutiful.'  It is two-and-a-half hours of unrelenting bleakness.  I recall nary a smile being cracked the entire film.  Well, perhaps by Maricel &Aacute;lvarez (as Bardem's character Uxbal's ex-wife), but even that gets an asterisk: she's on the manic high of a bipolar disorder sufferer.  It's quite a tally of bleakness: terminal illness; human trafficking; slave labor; bipolar disorder; forced emigration; broken families; police corruption; death by asphyxiation...quite a noxious brew.Still, if you're a Bardem fan like me, it is worth your time to see this film.  He's in almost every single scene.  In the few that he's not, he's often on the other end of the phone.  He simply carries the film on his capable shoulders.  Just don't go if you're in a dark mood, because you won't get a second of escapism here from I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu.",4,"If you're a Bardem fan like me, it is worth your time to see this film",1297296000,"02 10, 2011",2011,1736,"[""'d"", 'pay', 'watch', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'read', 'phone', 'book', 'have', 'utmost', 'respect', 'actor', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'catch', 'one', 'new', 'releases', 'big', 'screen', 'US', 'breakthrough', 'Julian', 'Schnabel', 'excellent', 'film', 'Night', 'Falls', 'So', 'Biutiful', 'was', 'natural', 'see', 'me.That', 'said', 'blow', 'hot', 'cold', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'doubt', 'extraordinarily', 'talented', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'overwrought', 'InBabelin', 'particular', 'Tried', 'So', 'Hard', 'Say', 'Something', 'Meaningful', 'did', 'like21', 'Grams', 'only', 'awesome', 'performances', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'when', 'saw', 'posters', 'Biutiful', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'was', 'A', 'film', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Only', 'one', 'guy', 'away', 'Almod', 'oacute', 'var', 'Anyone', 'else', 'eye', 'roll', 'snicker.I', 'came', 'down', 'somewhere', 'middle', ""'Biutiful"", 'two-and-a-half', 'hours', 'unrelenting', 'bleakness', 'recall', 'nary', 'smile', 'being', 'cracked', 'entire', 'film', 'Well', 'perhaps', 'Maricel', 'Aacute', 'lvarez', 'Bardem', 'character', 'Uxbal', 'ex-wife', 'even', 'asterisk', 'manic', 'high', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'sufferer', 'quite', 'tally', 'bleakness', 'terminal', 'illness', 'human', 'trafficking', 'slave', 'labor', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'forced', 'emigration', 'broken', 'families', 'police', 'corruption', 'death', 'asphyxiation', 'quite', 'noxious', 'brew.Still', ""'re"", 'Bardem', 'fan', 'time', 'see', 'film', 'almost', 'single', 'scene', 'few', 'not', 'often', 'other', 'end', 'phone', 'simply', 'film', 'capable', 'shoulders', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', ""'re"", 'dark', 'mood', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'second', 'escapism', 'here', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu']",N/A

""Adam Soch""","[116, 123]","If Mr. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu went to 3 continents to film the great story of BABEL, his latest film, BIUTIFUL is bringing people from 3 continents to one amazing place; the underworld of Barcelona. I saw this well crafted art film a few days ago in Los Angeles (Mr.I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Bradem were present) and wanted to share with you my take on this important, agonizing and remarkable picture.  It will take you to places seldom explored by others, it will set in motion untapped feelings, it will make you hate or love it, it will make you talk about it.Mr. Bardem is masterfully playing Uxbal and with him we slowly and painfully descend into Hades, human misery and his personal hell.  The complex character of Uxbal is central for the film and through his journey we meet some of the most unusual characters, places and situations.  There is an action/high energy scene of police chasing drug dealers in center of Barcelona, remarkably filmed by the very talented Rodrigo Prieto; it will stay with me for a long time.Many call BIUTIFUL ""a love story between a father and his children"", but it is much much more than that.  Maybe this line will sell a few extra tickets, but it is more about a extremely dysfunctional modern ""accidental"" family. The mother, Marambra is superbly played by newcomer Maricel &Aacute;lvarez, and the children are ever so patient, innocent and understanding.Kindness, hope, goodwill and humanity is not missing in Biutiful, it is ever-present in the daily dealings of Uxbal who's psyche we enter from the very beautiful and poetic beginning of the film.See BIUTIFUL with an open heart and mind, let yourself go places you never wanted to go, places you only watch on the evening news.My tag line for BIUTIFUL:  ""You don't choose your family. We all belong to somebody, but to belong to Uxbal and Marambra, is both a blessing and a curse.""Adam",5,Poetry of human suffering and redemption.,1292284800,"12 14, 2010",2010,1884,"['Mr.', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'went', '3', 'continents', 'film', 'great', 'story', 'BABEL', 'latest', 'film', 'BIUTIFUL', 'bringing', 'people', '3', 'continents', 'one', 'amazing', 'place', 'underworld', 'Barcelona', 'saw', 'well', 'crafted', 'art', 'film', 'few', 'days', 'ago', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Mr.I', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Bradem', 'were', 'present', 'wanted', 'share', 'take', 'important', 'agonizing', 'remarkable', 'picture', 'will', 'take', 'places', 'seldom', 'explored', 'others', 'will', 'set', 'motion', 'untapped', 'feelings', 'will', 'make', 'hate', 'love', 'will', 'make', 'talk', 'it.Mr', 'Bardem', 'masterfully', 'playing', 'Uxbal', 'slowly', 'painfully', 'descend', 'Hades', 'human', 'misery', 'personal', 'hell', 'complex', 'character', 'Uxbal', 'central', 'film', 'journey', 'meet', 'most', 'unusual', 'characters', 'places', 'situations', 'action/high', 'energy', 'scene', 'police', 'chasing', 'drug', 'dealers', 'center', 'Barcelona', 'remarkably', 'filmed', 'very', 'talented', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'will', 'stay', 'long', 'time.Many', 'call', 'BIUTIFUL', 'love', 'story', 'father', 'children', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'Maybe', 'line', 'will', 'sell', 'few', 'extra', 'tickets', 'more', 'extremely', 'dysfunctional', 'modern', 'accidental', 'family', 'mother', 'Marambra', 'superbly', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Maricel', 'Aacute', 'lvarez', 'children', 'are', 'ever', 'so', 'patient', 'innocent', 'understanding.Kindness', 'hope', 'goodwill', 'humanity', 'not', 'missing', 'Biutiful', 'ever-present', 'daily', 'dealings', 'Uxbal', 'who', 'psyche', 'enter', 'very', 'beautiful', 'poetic', 'beginning', 'film.See', 'BIUTIFUL', 'open', 'heart', 'mind', 'let', 'go', 'places', 'never', 'wanted', 'go', 'places', 'only', 'watch', 'evening', 'news.My', 'tag', 'line', 'BIUTIFUL', 'do', ""n't"", 'choose', 'family', 'belong', 'somebody', 'belong', 'Uxbal', 'Marambra', 'blessing', 'curse', 'Adam']",N/A

1381114,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B0041KKYF6,Carter,"[2, 3]","It at first seems odd that a film called Biutiful should appear so grim, showing us bleak workplaces, dirty living spaces, and grimy neighborhoods, capturing a world of struggle and deprivation and portraying it all in gritty images saturated with hues of gray and blue. But Inarritu has indeed given us a beautiful film with, in his own words, lavish ""emotional and visual architecture,"" rich characters, and beautiful faces, which the director calls ""the most intense and interesting geographies"" in his cinematic landscape. It's a fitting setting for the story of Uxbal, a small-time hood struggling to maintain his moral compass while getting into increasingly dirtier business. As he and his crew become more ensnared by their own actions, the moral dilemmas--for anyone with a conscience--become inevitably more severe. Uxbal tries, at times impetuously, to tidy up the dirty corners of his nefarious world, but the viewer is ultimately left to decide for himself if the protagonist's battered morality and stop-gap fixes are enough to make a difference. In the end, Inarritu's film asks not how one holds onto his humanity under constant conditions of hardship, but rather affirms that, under such conditions, our humanity is really ALL that any one of us has to hold on to--and that doing so can make the difference between maintaining one's sanity or going off the deep end, as some of the film's characters certainly do. Civilization is indeed the humanization of flawed individuals in an imperfect society. But we stand little chance of success unless individuals endeavor, even if imperfectly, to make the right choices or, in the director's words, to ""choose to see"" the right thing. Inarritu, Bo, and Giacobone don't apologize for Uxbal and don't excuse him. The filmmakers simply remind us that when people help others hold on to hope, that is biutiful. When people place the interest of others over self-interest, that is biutiful. When people ""choose to see"" beauty in an otherwise ugly world, that is biutiful. And when people cherish life even while others around them have no respect for it, that is biutiful. Biutiful may not be an easy film to watch. But filled with ""fear, love, resistance, [and] admiration,"" it's not an easy film to turn away from either. Like most difficult things, the film rewards us with a wisdom that reassures us, deep down, that the experience was well worthwhile. No spoiler here, but pay close attention to the exquisitely fine details of Uxbal's final scene with his daughter. It's an absolutely mesmerizing and haunting portrayal of the profound legacy a parent has the opportunity to pass on to his child. The word haunting isn't used lightly here. Even in an already visually abundant film, this scene is one of particularly stunning beauty and grace and is replete with images that I simply will never forget.",5,The Most Intense Geographies,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,2865,"['first', 'odd', 'film', 'called', 'Biutiful', 'should', 'appear', 'so', 'grim', 'showing', 'bleak', 'workplaces', 'dirty', 'living', 'spaces', 'grimy', 'neighborhoods', 'capturing', 'world', 'struggle', 'deprivation', 'portraying', 'gritty', 'images', 'saturated', 'hues', 'gray', 'blue', 'Inarritu', 'indeed', 'given', 'beautiful', 'film', 'own', 'words', 'lavish', 'emotional', 'visual', 'architecture', 'rich', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'director', 'most', 'intense', 'interesting', 'geographies', 'cinematic', 'landscape', 'fitting', 'setting', 'story', 'Uxbal', 'small-time', 'hood', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'moral', 'compass', 'getting', 'increasingly', 'dirtier', 'business', 'crew', 'become', 'more', 'ensnared', 'own', 'actions', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'anyone', 'conscience', 'become', 'inevitably', 'more', 'severe', 'Uxbal', 'tries', 'times', 'impetuously', 'tidy', 'up', 'dirty', 'corners', 'nefarious', 'world', 'viewer', 'ultimately', 'left', 'decide', 'protagonist', 'battered', 'morality', 'stop-gap', 'fixes', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'difference', 'end', 'Inarritu', 'film', 'not', 'how', 'one', 'humanity', 'constant', 'conditions', 'hardship', 'rather', 'affirms', 'such', 'conditions', 'humanity', 'really', 'ALL', 'one', 'hold', 'doing', 'so', 'can', 'make', 'difference', 'maintaining', 'one', 'sanity', 'going', 'off', 'deep', 'end', 'film', 'characters', 'certainly', 'do', 'Civilization', 'indeed', 'humanization', 'flawed', 'individuals', 'imperfect', 'society', 'stand', 'little', 'chance', 'success', 'individuals', 'endeavor', 'even', 'imperfectly', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'director', 'words', 'choose', 'see', 'right', 'thing', 'Inarritu', 'Bo', 'Giacobone', 'do', ""n't"", 'apologize', 'Uxbal', 'do', ""n't"", 'excuse', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'remind', 'when', 'people', 'help', 'others', 'hold', 'hope', 'biutiful', 'When', 'people', 'place', 'interest', 'others', 'self-interest', 'biutiful', 'When', 'people', 'choose', 'see', 'beauty', 'otherwise', 'ugly', 'world', 'biutiful', 'when', 'people', 'cherish', 'life', 'even', 'others', 'have', 'respect', 'biutiful', 'Biutiful', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'filled', 'fear', 'love', 'resistance', '[', ']', 'admiration', 'not', 'easy', 'film', 'turn', 'away', 'either', 'most', 'difficult', 'things', 'film', 'rewards', 'wisdom', 'deep', 'down', 'experience', 'was', 'well', 'worthwhile', 'spoiler', 'here', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'exquisitely', 'fine', 'details', 'Uxbal', 'final', 'scene', 'daughter', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'haunting', 'portrayal', 'profound', 'legacy', 'parent', 'opportunity', 'pass', 'child', 'word', 'haunting', ""n't"", 'used', 'lightly', 'here', 'Even', 'already', 'visually', 'abundant', 'film', 'scene', 'one', 'particularly', 'stunning', 'beauty', 'grace', 'replete', 'images', 'simply', 'will', 'never', 'forget']",N/A

We can't get away from that, nor avoid it.Most European directors take much longer to develop character in films than American directors.  There are scenes in this film that wordlessly drag on, with panning shots that are longer than what American film directors recommend.  But there is nothing wrong with that.  This just means it takes longer to watch a European movie and this artpiece is no different.Uxbal (Javier Bardem) plays the middleman for a counterfeit operation in Barcelona.  He works for a few crooked Chinese who manipulate Africans and Chinese who come into the country illegally to work for pennies a day.  Uxbal takes his share of the money but he also has a soft heart for the people who live in dark, musty cold basements.His wife is a drug-dependent, bi-polar prostitute who only thinks about the next trick.  Her goal in life is to have fun, despite her two children that love her very much.  Unfortunately, Uxbal lovers her, too, and this uneven chemistry gleams throughout this movie.We learn right away there is something wrong with Uxbal.  He is in the late stages of prostate cancer, and his life is flashing him by throughout this movie.  He lives what time he has left to redeem himself among the people he also took advantage of earlier, realizing there are many victims left behind doing the work that he does.Shot in and around Barcelona's slums, there's a lot of touching cinematography in this movie.  Smoggy city panoramas, gushing ocean waves, whispering cold mountain pines and loud street scenes that want to take over your auditory nerves.  Take all that out and you have a more American-style movie with action and romp but less story and plot.This is not a movie to watch when depressed, or while grieving the loss of a loved one.  There is more to this movie than what I have just posted, but in the end of this 2:18 hour movie (not including the ten minutes of credits in the end), this is one movie that will haunt your senses for a while.Crashing waves,  whispering pines, dying owls that spit up hairballs.

1381116,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0041KKYF6,Chris Pandolfi,"[15, 23]","In spite of the cumbersome details, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's ""Biutiful"" is essentially the story of a man who must put his affairs in order before he dies. His name is Uxbal (Oscar nominee Javier Bardem), and he has been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, presumably of the prostate. He's a Barcelona career criminal, acting as an intermediary between the underworld and a sweatshop that produces phony designer handbags to sell on the streets. To make extra money, he negotiates to have the undocumented Chinese workers that produce the handbags lent out to a construction company looking to cut corners financially. One of them is his children's babysitter, who looks no older than fifteen or sixteen but already has a baby. There also ties to illegal Senegalese drug dealers, who are safe for as long as Uxbal can continue bribing the cops.On top of that, there's his personal life. He's separated from his wife, Marambra (Maricel Alvarez), who's bipolar and an alcoholic. He's left to care for his two children, Ana and Mateo (Hanaa Bouchaib and Guillermo Estrella), who he loves dearly. His greatest fear is that they won't remember him; he doesn't remember either of his parents, although he does have a old photograph of his father as a young man. He also wants to ensure that his children are cared for once he's gone, which will be difficult since his wife was clearly not meant to be a mother. She makes a go of it, though, by suggesting a train ride and a family vacation for Ana's birthday. He doesn't tell anyone how sick he is, initially because he desperately clings to the hope that he will beat his cancer.Uxbal is sometimes called upon to speak with the spirits of the recently deceased, a service he will provide for a fee. It's not made explicitly clear if he's genuinely blessed with a sixth sense or merely telling grieving families what they want to hear, and an early scene at a memorial service for multiple children is of no help. We do know that he's friends with another professed medium named Bea (Ana Wagener), who knows that he will die. She suggests that he make peace with the dead. He's more inclined to make peace with the living by trying to improve on the lives of the immigrants he has exploited for who knows how long. Although unintended, one of these attempts will have very tragic results. He isn't sure whether he should do the decent thing and turn himself in. To me the answer is obvious, but then again, movies generally don't play by the rules of life.He's trying to do some good with what little time he has left. This is admirable, but it's also expected in a movie like this. As touching and generally sound as the message is, some of the depicted injustices seem manufactured solely for the satisfaction of watching Uxbal redeem himself. He's not an innocent man, and yet we're forced to view him through a remarkably flattering lens, in all likelihood because of his illness. One wonders: What if he didn't have cancer? What if he was a perfectly healthy man who one day decided to start doing the right thing? That, to me, would add a lot more credibility to the film. Stories about people doing good deeds when faced with their own mortality have long since outgrown their ability to surprise me; they're in fact so commonplace that the very idea is just short of anticlimactic.Despite a routine narrative, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu does a wonderful job of developing the characters and exploring the settings, the latter looking like anything but the idealistic Barcelona you might see in a tourism commercial. There's never the sense that the actors are merely tools for advancing the plot; they approach their roles realistically. As for Bardem, there's no denying the film benefits from his presence. His range of emotion doesn't seem forced, which is good during the first part of the movie and even better towards the end, when his illness becomes aggressive. In essence, he adds humanity to his character, making him relatable even in the face of a contrived story.While not perfect, ""Biutiful"" (Mexico's entry in the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film) improves on much of what made me resist I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's previous film, ""Babel."" It's not a meaningless display of suffering, but a story with a message I could relate to and care about. It's bookended by scenes that feature the same actors delivering the same lines; the only difference is the perspective, the order and angle of the shots. We're not meant to understand the meaning of the imagery or the dialogue until the end, but both instances lend a wonderful sense of serenity and acceptance. Perhaps the underlying message is that, if we make life a little better for others in this world, we will find peace in the next.",4,Are My Affairs in Order?,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,4789,"['spite', 'cumbersome', 'details', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'Biutiful', 'essentially', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'put', 'affairs', 'order', 'name', 'Uxbal', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'advanced-stage', 'cancer', 'presumably', 'prostate', 'Barcelona', 'career', 'criminal', 'acting', 'intermediary', 'underworld', 'sweatshop', 'phony', 'designer', 'handbags', 'sell', 'streets', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'have', 'undocumented', 'Chinese', 'workers', 'produce', 'handbags', 'lent', 'out', 'construction', 'company', 'looking', 'cut', 'corners', 'financially', 'One', 'children', 'babysitter', 'who', 'older', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'already', 'baby', 'also', 'ties', 'illegal', 'Senegalese', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'are', 'safe', 'as', 'long', 'Uxbal', 'can', 'continue', 'bribing', 'cops.On', 'top', 'personal', 'life', 'separated', 'wife', 'Marambra', 'Maricel', 'Alvarez', 'who', 'bipolar', 'alcoholic', 'left', 'care', 'two', 'children', 'Ana', 'Mateo', 'Hanaa', 'Bouchaib', 'Guillermo', 'Estrella', 'who', 'dearly', 'greatest', 'fear', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', ""n't"", 'remember', 'parents', 'have', 'old', 'photograph', 'father', 'young', 'man', 'also', 'ensure', 'children', 'are', 'cared', 'once', 'gone', 'will', 'be', 'difficult', 'wife', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'mother', 'go', 'though', 'suggesting', 'train', 'ride', 'family', 'vacation', 'Ana', 'birthday', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anyone', 'how', 'sick', 'initially', 'desperately', 'hope', 'will', 'beat', 'cancer.Uxbal', 'sometimes', 'called', 'upon', 'speak', 'spirits', 'recently', 'deceased', 'service', 'will', 'provide', 'fee', 'not', 'made', 'explicitly', 'clear', 'genuinely', 'blessed', 'sixth', 'sense', 'merely', 'telling', 'grieving', 'families', 'what', 'want', 'hear', 'early', 'scene', 'memorial', 'service', 'multiple', 'children', 'help', 'do', 'know', 'friends', 'professed', 'medium', 'named', 'Bea', 'Ana', 'Wagener', 'who', 'will', 'die', 'make', 'peace', 'dead', 'more', 'inclined', 'make', 'peace', 'living', 'trying', 'improve', 'lives', 'immigrants', 'exploited', 'who', 'how', 'long', 'unintended', 'one', 'attempts', 'will', 'have', 'very', 'tragic', 'results', ""n't"", 'sure', 'should', 'do', 'decent', 'thing', 'turn', 'answer', 'obvious', 'then', 'again', 'movies', 'generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'rules', 'life.He', 'trying', 'do', 'good', 'what', 'little', 'time', 'left', 'admirable', 'also', 'expected', 'movie', 'touching', 'generally', 'sound', 'message', 'depicted', 'injustices', 'seem', 'manufactured', 'solely', 'satisfaction', 'watching', 'Uxbal', 'redeem', 'not', 'innocent', 'man', 'yet', ""'re"", 'forced', 'view', 'remarkably', 'flattering', 'lens', 'likelihood', 'illness', 'One', 'wonders', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cancer', 'What', 'was', 'perfectly', 'healthy', 'man', 'who', 'one', 'day', 'decided', 'start', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'would', 'add', 'lot', 'more', 'credibility', 'film', 'Stories', 'people', 'doing', 'good', 'deeds', 'when', 'faced', 'own', 'mortality', 'have', 'long', 'outgrown', 'ability', 'surprise', ""'re"", 'fact', 'so', 'commonplace', 'very', 'idea', 'just', 'short', 'routine', 'narrative', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'wonderful', 'job', 'developing', 'characters', 'exploring', 'settings', 'latter', 'looking', 'anything', 'idealistic', 'Barcelona', 'might', 'see', 'tourism', 'commercial', 'never', 'sense', 'actors', 'are', 'merely', 'tools', 'advancing', 'plot', 'approach', 'roles', 'realistically', 'Bardem', 'denying', 'film', 'benefits', 'presence', 'range', 'emotion', ""n't"", 'seem', 'forced', 'good', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'end', 'when', 'illness', 'aggressive', 'essence', 'humanity', 'character', 'making', 'relatable', 'even', 'face', 'contrived', 'story.While', 'not', 'perfect', 'Biutiful', 'Mexico', 'entry', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Language', 'Film', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'resist', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'previous', 'film', 'Babel', 'not', 'meaningless', 'display', 'suffering', 'story', 'message', 'could', 'relate', 'care', 'about', 'bookended', 'scenes', 'feature', 'same', 'actors', 'delivering', 'same', 'lines', 'only', 'difference', 'perspective', 'order', 'angle', 'shots', ""'re"", 'not', 'meant', 'understand', 'meaning', 'imagery', 'dialogue', 'end', 'instances', 'lend', 'wonderful', 'sense', 'serenity', 'acceptance', 'Perhaps', 'underlying', 'message', 'make', 'life', 'little', 'better', 'others', 'world', 'will', 'find', 'peace', 'next']",N/A

1381118,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B0041KKYF6,C. Sawin,"[24, 34]","At times, it's difficult to summarize your thoughts about a specific film. It isn't because the film is necessarily so good or bad that it's beyond words, but because you're unsure how to feel about said film until the credits finally roll. Biutiful is such a film.Biutiful, its spelling having a simple yet somewhat brilliant explanation, features a lot of symbolism that will go over viewers heads. It also is incredibly similar to I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's previous works such as 21 Grams and Babel in both style and tone. The drama is beyond bleak and practically hopeless. The out of tune soundtrack, the rocks Uxbal gives to his children, and people clutching to the ceiling will leave many scratching their heads. Many ideas seem to be hinted at, but are never fully fleshed out like reflections and shadows moving out of sync from their source. However, the film is driven by Bardem's emotionally draining, physical, and all around powerful performance.The scene that really makes the entire film worthwhile is the scene in the Chinese warehouse right before Uxbal visits his brother's strip club. It's the most effective, long-lasting, and memorable scene in the film. In the same breath though, what was up with the sound? It was like it was purposely terrible at certain points in the film. At times, it seemed significant to showcase the sound of the characters' heartbeats, but just felt sloppy the one or two other times it occurred. There were also quite a few memorable quotes in the film including, ""It's dangerous to trust a man who's hungry.""Biutiful is an unusual drama that is both confusing at times and ridiculously intriguing at others. A vigorously passionate performance by Javier Bardem may not be enough to save what is otherwise a sometimes mindboggling and hellacious journey through the eyes of what seems like the most unlucky man in the world. Even in comparison to his other works, Biutiful seems even more bleak and dreary than I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's other works. What's bizarre is that the film does give you a strange sense of hope. No matter how bad you think your life currently is or was, this film proves that it can always be worse even if the presentation is more than a little mentally and emotionally exhausting. It's also interesting to note that even though the film leans more to the bizarre side while being downright depressing, it does make a long-lasting impression and sticks with you as you contemplate scenes and occurrences in the film days after you've seen it.",3,"Unusual, intriguing, and emotional",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",2010,2519,"['times', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'thoughts', 'specific', 'film', ""n't"", 'film', 'necessarily', 'so', 'good', 'bad', 'words', ""'re"", 'unsure', 'how', 'feel', 'about', 'said', 'film', 'credits', 'finally', 'roll', 'Biutiful', 'such', 'film.Biutiful', 'spelling', 'having', 'simple', 'yet', 'somewhat', 'brilliant', 'explanation', 'lot', 'symbolism', 'will', 'go', 'viewers', 'heads', 'also', 'incredibly', 'similar', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'previous', 'works', 'such', '21', 'Grams', 'Babel', 'style', 'tone', 'drama', 'bleak', 'practically', 'hopeless', 'out', 'tune', 'soundtrack', 'rocks', 'Uxbal', 'children', 'people', 'clutching', 'ceiling', 'will', 'leave', 'many', 'scratching', 'heads', 'Many', 'ideas', 'seem', 'be', 'hinted', 'are', 'never', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'reflections', 'shadows', 'moving', 'sync', 'source', 'However', 'film', 'driven', 'Bardem', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'physical', 'around', 'powerful', 'performance.The', 'scene', 'really', 'entire', 'film', 'worthwhile', 'scene', 'Chinese', 'warehouse', 'right', 'Uxbal', 'brother', 'strip', 'club', 'most', 'effective', 'long-lasting', 'memorable', 'scene', 'film', 'same', 'breath', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'sound', 'was', 'was', 'purposely', 'terrible', 'certain', 'points', 'film', 'times', 'seemed', 'significant', 'showcase', 'sound', 'characters', 'heartbeats', 'just', 'felt', 'sloppy', 'one', 'two', 'other', 'times', 'occurred', 'were', 'also', 'quite', 'few', 'memorable', 'quotes', 'film', 'including', 'dangerous', 'trust', 'man', 'who', 'hungry', 'Biutiful', 'unusual', 'drama', 'confusing', 'times', 'ridiculously', 'intriguing', 'others', 'vigorously', 'passionate', 'performance', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'save', 'what', 'otherwise', 'sometimes', 'mindboggling', 'hellacious', 'journey', 'eyes', 'what', 'most', 'unlucky', 'man', 'world', 'Even', 'comparison', 'other', 'works', 'Biutiful', 'even', 'more', 'bleak', 'dreary', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'other', 'works', 'What', 'bizarre', 'film', 'give', 'strange', 'sense', 'hope', 'matter', 'how', 'bad', 'think', 'life', 'currently', 'was', 'film', 'can', 'always', 'be', 'worse', 'even', 'presentation', 'more', 'little', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'exhausting', 'also', 'interesting', 'note', 'even', 'film', 'more', 'bizarre', 'side', 'being', 'downright', 'depressing', 'make', 'long-lasting', 'impression', 'sticks', 'contemplate', 'scenes', 'occurrences', 'film', 'days', ""'ve"", 'seen']",N/A

But for this one - someone would have to explain it to me. I just truly didn't get it or see the need in a movie of this subject matter. Javier is at his supreme acting in this film but geez why of all roles - THIS ONE? He did play the part excellent but I'm thinking the whole way through from one scene to the next - OKAY ... and ... OKAY ... ummm???? Okay ... and .... Pfff! I thought towards the end - enough is enough already!! It was a very depressing movie and I actually fell asleep through certain scenes. I don't like now days how movie scenes are cut off and shifted from one to the next. Hello? Let's just stay on THAT scene and finish it already then move on to the next! Call me old fashioned but again for the millionth time - I just didn't get it. I know and understand what this movie is about but my question is WHY???? Why to make it and why so depressing? We see enough of this now days with the economy the way it is - hey! that may just be the reason why it was made?

1381126,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0041KKYF6,Grady Harp,"[4, 9]","How does one define BIUTIFUL? Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has written and directed yet another work of cinematic art that is so multifaceted that it early defies explanation.  From the first frame to the last (and even in the credits) this is a film of unusually powerful impact, dealing with the underbelly of the world and succeeding in sharing how mankind survives event the most strained of circumstances.Uxbal (the brilliant Javier Bardem) is connected to his grandfather who left Spain for Mexico - an adagio scene at film's opening shares his parting with his grandfather in a snowy forest, a connection between Uxbal and the afterlife that surfaces periodically throughout this otherwise  world bound story. Uxbal is a facilitator in the crime scene of Barcelona, aiding illicit African street peddlers and human traffikers in Chinese laborers while trying to support his little family.  He is married to a seemingly despicable bipolar Maramba (Maricel &Aacute;lvarez) and they fight over the care of their two children Ana (Hanaa Bouchaib) and Mateo (Guillermo Estrella): Maramba when not controlled with meds drinks heavily and works the night streets, forcing Uxbal to be father and mother in their shambles of an apartment.  Uxbal's brother Tito (Eduard Fern&aacute;ndez) provides 'shelter' for Maramba when he is not involved with drugs and the grotesque night club life of stripper clubs.  Uxbal is diagnosed with metastatic prostatic carcinoma and informed he only has a few months to live. He visits a bruja Bea (Ana Wagener) to communicate with the dead and gains guidance on how to bring some good to not only his children whom he adores but also to the victims of the human trafficking.  When the police arrest his friend,  Senegalese Ekweme (Cheikh Ndiaye) Uxbal promises to look after his wife Ige (Diaryatou Daff) and their infant son Samuel. When he discovers that the Chinese workers are living in a crowded basement in the cold he barters for gas heaters (buying the cheapest ones in order to pocket the excess money), but the heaters fail and an entire group of illegal immigrants  die from the fumes.  Uxbal's health fails, his family disintegrates, his working relations with both the Chinese and the Spanish crime bosses break and Uxbal is left at the end of his life attempting to leave the world a better place for his children.The supporting cast of this film is excellent - some of the stand out performances include those by Rub&eacute;n Ochandiano, Karra Elejalde, Cheng Tai Shen, Luo Jin, and Lang Sofia Lin.  But it is the impossibly difficult role of Uxbal that shows Javier Bardem's extraordinary talent to be that of one of the finest actors before the public today.  His character is raw and dirty but Bardem finds the flickers of redemptive light in his character and makes them glow.  The cinematography paints a grimy crime world of Barcelona thanks to the sensitive camera eye of Rodrigo Prieto and as always the composer Gustavo Santaolalla creates a score that enhances every frame.  His choice to include the 'Adagio' from Ravel's 'Piano Concerto in G' (as performed by Zolt&aacute;n Kocsis with the Budapest Festival Orchestra conducted by Iv&aacute;n Fischer) is radiantly encored in the end titles.  Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu  is clearly one of the geniuses of our time.  This is a masterpiece of moviemaking.

1381129,A72A8JDQK4D8S,B0041KKYF6,John A. Lind,"[0, 0]","First . . . be aware that this is a foreign film in Spanish without an English dubbed soundtrack. It does have English subtitling and in my Region A (North American) Blu-ray it's hard encoded into the film; it cannot be turned off. Folks that don't like films without an English sound track will have to be willing to set that aside or pass on this film. I've got a number of films like this so it doesn't bother me, but it does require paying closer attention visually.It's easy to see why this film, set in the Barcelona slums, was nominated for several Oscars including Best Foreign Language Film. Javier Bardem,is phenomenal as the protagonist, Uxbal. (Bardem's breakthrough in US films was the psychopathic killer in the Coen Brothers &#34;No Country for Old Men&#34;; his role in this film is entirely different.) Director Alejandro Inarritu, who also collaborated on the screenplay, keeps a complex set of subplots well organized as Uxbal (Bardem) is diagnosed with terminal cancer with a couple months to live as his life is relentlessly unraveling around him very quickly. A father of two children separated from a bipolar alcoholic wife, he seeks through all this to get his affairs in order and make provisions for his children. The biblical Job comes to mind except anti-hero Uxbal is the opposite of righteous. He's deeply involved in several criminal endeavors including illegal Chinese immigrants working in a sweatshop making counterfeit goods and working major construction sites, and illegal African immigrants selling the counterfeit goods and illegal drugs on the streets as illegal sidewalk &#34;vendors.&#34;There is very little relief from the relentless onslaught of Uxbal's life coming apart at every turn. The real power of this film is how he perseveres through all of it, ultimately coming to terms with his immediately imminent death and his tenacity in ensuring his young children will be adequately cared for. For all its bleak darkness, this is the very bright beacon in the film. After viewing and having some time to think about it, IMHO Inarritu very deliberately did this to create as strong a counterpoise between the two as possible.As with many European films, this one develops the plot, subplots and characters at a leisurely pace. Those accustomed to US films and film making may think it plodding, but it allows absorbing the complexities of the story and more cerebral consideration of its underlying themes than a faster pace would allow. This isn't an action film, it's about empathy and raw emotions.

The acting is phenomenal, with Bardem showing once again how well he can play complex and subtle roles. Child actors are typically hard to rate for foreign films, since the line delivery isn't as easy to analyze, but the kids seem to do great in their roles as well (though some of their dialogue didn't feel very realistic for children their age).The music really worked well in conveying the emotional impact of each of the scenes, as well as the mental state of the characters. So, too, did the cinematography, which at times felt like a documentary and other times felt surreal (Boob head?!

And rather than depressed, I finished the film pleased with this extraordinary gift of memories and protection this father left for his children.",5,Barcelona Underground,1327968000,"01 31, 2012",2012,982,"['confess', 'have', 'lost', 'bearings', 'much', 'lightening-paced', 'story', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'striking', 'Lodestar', 'kept', 'fully', 'engaged', 'psychological', 'undertow', 'Barcelona', 'ascending', 'towers', 'Spanish', 'filmmaker', 'Alejandro', 'Inarritu', 'modern-day', 'hell', 'where', 'bipolar', 'moms', 'batter', 'children', 'African', 'Chinese', 'slaves', 'labor', 'black', 'market.Yet', 'one', 'man', 'given', '2', 'months', 'not', 'only', 'redeem', 'blighted', 'personal', 'life', 'possible', 'preserve', 'future', 'two', 'essentially', 'motherless', 'children.Uxbal', 'called', 'slowly', 'terms', 'fate', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'help', 'older', 'wise', 'woman', 'seer', 'grasp', 'own', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'thus', 'uniting', 'last', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'child', 'Sea', 'Bardem', 'esentially', 'Hercules', 'eyes', 'rather', 'depressed', 'finished', 'film', 'pleased', 'extraordinary', 'gift', 'memories', 'protection', 'father', 'left', 'children']",N/A
1381137,ANVOS4JLN2MKR,B0041KKYF6,Lloyd Christmas,"[4, 6]","The single most gut-wrenchingly depressing movie ever filmed. After having made the mistake of renting this, it will be a long time before I rent anything else at all. I'm serious about that. This film even surpasses the hysterically morbid ""The Road,"" also of recent vintage. This film is beautifully acted, and most especially is Javier Bardem brilliant throughout. Also, this filmmaker deserves kudos for not shying away from unpleasant contemporary urban problems that most people and most films would shy away from.However, this isn't the only film I have seen from this filmmaker (I've also rented ""Amores Perros"") and I now can unequivocally state that this foreign filmmaker has a fetish for unrelenting morbidity in roughly the same degree that American filmmaker Quentin Tarantino has a fetish for meaningless blood and gore. This filmmaker will do anything to heighten the despair of his protagonists. In a way it is a true reflection of post-Christian Western Civilization, I admit. However, this filmmaker is so rabid about compiling hopeless despair upon hopeless despair onto his protagonists that it even causes him to occasionally slip up and make mistakes, and here in this movie there is one. You see, Bardem's character, who is dying and has the World and His Uncle breathing down his back, and meanwhile has to hurriedly figure out who is going to tend to raising his two children after he dies, well, this guy has one and only one person in the world that he can trust and go to for consolation. It is some elderly woman who meets with him two times during the movie and offers him good advice on what to do in this dire situation. This old woman is the only other person in the entire film who evinces a level of civility and humanity above the level of the animals. Everyone else in the film, except for the poor, soon-to-be-orphaned children, of course, and I suppose the already-dead Chinese lady and her child (are you getting the idea that there's a lot of death in this film?), and perhaps the protagonist, I say again EVERYONE else in this film is a filthy, amoral, self-absorbed animal. Yet this old woman stands apart from it all. She meets with Bardem's character and consoles him and tells him what to do as all the world collapses around him, and all the rest of humanity basically betrays him. The movie never sufficiently explains who this old woman is; it just lets us know that she is the only person that Bardem's character can trust in the world, and that this trust is not ill-founded.And yet, Bardem's character never even stops to think of asking this old woman to look after his children after he dies. It's never even brought up. And there are two reasons for this: #1) If the old woman declines to take care of the children, then her character is destroyed, and she would be shown to be just as rotten as just about every other character in the world in this movie; or, #2) (and this is quite telling) If the old woman would accept this obvious offer that should have been made, then the filmmaker would lose his ability to ruthlessly craft the darkest, most unrelenting hopelessness that he seeks to portray with every fiber of his morbid being. This filmmaker desperately wanted this protagonist to be bludgeoned into the darkest pit of despair, and for we the poor viewers to likewise be brought down to his same level of hopeless despair, and this filmmaker wasn't going to allow any gaffes in character development to get in the way of that!--No way!Instead, the filmmaker, in his morbidity fetish, leaves the viewer squirming in his seat as he sees the inevitable and profoundly sad death of the protagonist, meanwhile leaving his poor children all alone with no one to watch them.Ew[...] Watching this film, being led down the path to the conclusion of this film, is like being a child, and having another child in the neighborhood invite you to come over to his backyard and be his audience while he pulls the legs off of frogs, and tears the wings off of butterflies.This is sick stuff.Extraordinarily well crafted sick stuff; nevertheless, having learned my lesson, I'll never partake in a film made by this man again. Whenever I am recovered from this and am able to rent movies again, I never ever will be a witness to a motion picture made by this filmmaker. No thanks. I will not put myself through this filmmaker's sick dark deathcult stuff ever again.",3,Extraordinarily well crafted and sickening,1325376000,"01 1, 2012",2012,4414,"['single', 'most', 'gut-wrenchingly', 'depressing', 'movie', 'ever', 'filmed', 'having', 'made', 'mistake', 'renting', 'will', 'be', 'long', 'time', 'rent', 'anything', 'else', ""'m"", 'serious', 'film', 'even', 'hysterically', 'Road', 'also', 'recent', 'vintage', 'film', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'most', 'especially', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'brilliant', 'Also', 'filmmaker', 'kudos', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'unpleasant', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'problems', 'most', 'people', 'most', 'films', 'would', 'shy', 'away', 'from.However', ""n't"", 'only', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'filmmaker', ""'ve"", 'also', 'rented', 'Amores', 'Perros', 'now', 'can', 'unequivocally', 'state', 'foreign', 'filmmaker', 'fetish', 'unrelenting', 'morbidity', 'roughly', 'same', 'degree', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'fetish', 'meaningless', 'blood', 'gore', 'filmmaker', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'heighten', 'despair', 'protagonists', 'way', 'true', 'reflection', 'post-Christian', 'Western', 'Civilization', 'admit', 'However', 'filmmaker', 'so', 'rabid', 'compiling', 'hopeless', 'despair', 'hopeless', 'despair', 'protagonists', 'even', 'occasionally', 'slip', 'up', 'make', 'mistakes', 'here', 'movie', 'one', 'see', 'Bardem', 'character', 'who', 'dying', 'World', 'Uncle', 'breathing', 'down', 'back', 'meanwhile', 'hurriedly', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'going', 'tend', 'raising', 'two', 'children', 'well', 'guy', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'world', 'can', 'trust', 'go', 'consolation', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'two', 'times', 'movie', 'good', 'advice', 'what', 'do', 'dire', 'situation', 'old', 'woman', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'entire', 'film', 'who', 'level', 'civility', 'humanity', 'level', 'animals', 'Everyone', 'else', 'film', 'poor', 'soon-to-be-orphaned', 'children', 'course', 'suppose', 'already-dead', 'Chinese', 'lady', 'child', 'are', 'getting', 'idea', 'lot', 'death', 'film', 'perhaps', 'protagonist', 'say', 'again', 'EVERYONE', 'else', 'film', 'filthy', 'amoral', 'self-absorbed', 'animal', 'old', 'woman', 'apart', 'Bardem', 'character', 'what', 'do', 'world', 'rest', 'humanity', 'basically', 'movie', 'never', 'sufficiently', 'who', 'old', 'woman', 'just', 'know', 'only', 'person', 'Bardem', 'character', 'can', 'trust', 'world', 'trust', 'not', 'ill-founded.And', 'yet', 'Bardem', 'character', 'never', 'even', 'think', 'asking', 'old', 'woman', 'look', 'children', 'never', 'even', 'brought', 'up', 'are', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'old', 'woman', 'take', 'care', 'children', 'then', 'character', 'destroyed', 'would', 'be', 'shown', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'rotten', 'just', 'other', 'character', 'world', 'movie', '2', 'quite', 'telling', 'old', 'woman', 'would', 'accept', 'obvious', 'offer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'then', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'lose', 'ability', 'ruthlessly', 'craft', 'darkest', 'most', 'unrelenting', 'hopelessness', 'portray', 'fiber', 'morbid', 'being', 'filmmaker', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'protagonist', 'be', 'bludgeoned', 'darkest', 'pit', 'despair', 'poor', 'viewers', 'likewise', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'same', 'level', 'hopeless', 'despair', 'filmmaker', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'allow', 'gaffes', 'character', 'development', 'get', 'way', 'way', 'Instead', 'filmmaker', 'morbidity', 'fetish', 'viewer', 'squirming', 'seat', 'inevitable', 'profoundly', 'sad', 'death', 'protagonist', 'meanwhile', 'leaving', 'poor', 'children', 'alone', 'one', 'watch', 'them.Ew', '[', ']', 'Watching', 'film', 'being', 'led', 'down', 'path', 'conclusion', 'film', 'being', 'child', 'having', 'child', 'neighborhood', 'invite', 'come', 'backyard', 'be', 'audience', 'legs', 'frogs', 'wings', 'butterflies.This', 'sick', 'stuff.Extraordinarily', 'well', 'crafted', 'sick', 'stuff', 'nevertheless', 'having', 'learned', 'lesson', ""'ll"", 'never', 'partake', 'film', 'made', 'man', 'again', 'Whenever', 'am', 'recovered', 'am', 'able', 'rent', 'movies', 'again', 'never', 'ever', 'will', 'be', 'witness', 'motion', 'picture', 'made', 'filmmaker', 'thanks', 'will', 'not', 'put', 'filmmaker', 'sick', 'dark', 'deathcult', 'stuff', 'ever', 'again']",N/A

In ""Biutiful,"" however, he zooms in on one character, Uxbal, a single father from Barcelona, facing terminal cancer.Uxbal is a fascinating character with many good intentions that don't always translate into good deeds. While he truly cares for people (his brother even calls him the Dalai Lama), he actually makes a living from an operation where illegal Senegalese immigrants sell on the streets the counterfeited bags and pirated CDs produced in a sweatshop by a group of frightened Chinese who sleep on the floor of a locked basement.So yes, Uxbal is a complicated hero, not perfect by any means, but because of Bardem's earnest performance you feel Uxbal's pain, and he also wins you over with the love he so tenderly expresses for his soon-to-be fatherless children, and for the father he never met. And that's what the movie is truly about: parenthood, how people, no matter their nationality, are always concerned with giving their kids a better life. You'll find that most of the characters (from Uxbal, to the police officer, to the sweatshop owner, to the main Senegalese immigrant) are trying to do what's best for their kids. But are their choices moral or even legal? Morality is a big theme here, and the movie will leave you questioning even your own.To appreciate this film you need to understand I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's style--bold and bleak and confrontational.

Javier Bardem proves once again he is one of the best actors working today.  He plays a low level facilitator who acts as a middle man to supply non-union workers to various construction trades in Barcelona.  He does this by supplying illegal Chinese and African aliens.  This is his job so he takes the payoffs, part of which goes to the authorities, especially the police that look the other way.  He also is responsible for a daughter about 12 and a son about 7 as his estranged wife is bipolar and a sometime addict.  Uxbal (Bardem), if he doesn't have enough problems, is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.  Oh yeah, he can also talk to the dead, at least the recent dead who haven't quite made the journey away from their physical self.  This is actually a second job as he often gets paid to relay the final words.  There are also a lot of characters in the story including 2 Chinese gay dudes, one of which has a house full of family.  Since this is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrutu putting this all together, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised by the plot overload.

What is here is an extraordinary performance by Javi&eacute;r Bardem, in practically every scene in a 2  hour film. Others have criticized the film because there is no back-story, but the focus is that Uxbal  finds out he is dying and is suddenly concerned about his kids, and finding a bit of dignity before he goes. There are multiple subplots, and I&ntilde;rritu juggles this long narrative into a tapestry of angst and survival. None of it turns out well, and, without blabbing away the story, this is a film of integrity and dignity, as discovered by a low life with no exit plan.  Great acting by all, including Maricel Alvarez as the mother of his kids, and Diaryatou Daff is riveting as, perhaps, the only light at the end. Bardem shines, in generous close-ups, showing every small detail of concern. Some dark scenes didn't read well on the DVD I watched, and the subtitles were often hard to see, especially when Alvarez was being manic. Maybe not the greatest, but it resonated with me.

In one sense it tells about the decline and aging of western civilization. ALmost every European (Spanish in this case) including the protagonist (Javier) is corrupt. The only exception is the old lady that Javier visits twice in the film and his daughter Ana.It is also how western civilization has exploited other people from the third world, Asians, Africans, etc. When Javier (Uxball) feels that he is approaching death, he asks the African lady to take care of his children. he gives her a lot of money (about 50,000 euros) and his apartment. is the African woman corrupt also? No. The director of the film addresses this question, by showing us that she took her belongings and the money and her child and went to the train station. She was able to run away with this great amount of money  to her poor country. But no, she chose to stay and take care of the dying man and two children. This is telling us that the young migrants will take care of the old people in the western countries. There is hope in the daughter Ana. She will work with the African woman.Another thread in the film is how indifferent Spain (and Europe) is to the fate of migrants and third world countries. When the Chinese workers die of gas poisoning, the chic and pretty TV announcer reports the incident with genuine shock but also with indifference so as not to ruin the morning of the people of the city. We are taken right away after this terrible massacre to a nightclub in Barcelona where sex and drugs are the dominant themes. Javier's brother is having drinks and going after his next sex partner(s). However, death is also omnipresent with Javier at the table. The brother does not want to talk about anything serious and offers Javier a drink. The next day we see the brother waking up with the TV turned on showing the tragedy on the shoreline of Barcelona. He does not pay attention.We also see a seedy and decaying city at the micro-level. This Barcelona from the inside, or is it almost every great European city?A third thread is the spirituality. Europe has forgotten Christianity. And the film is an attempt to return to the purity of the soul. When people die in the movie their souls are seen on the ceiling. When Javier dies, his soul is sitting next to him. Next we see his soul on the road to paradise where everyone returns to a young age. His father meets him and his father looks around 25. he offers him a cigarette and tells him stories about the sea as he used to do in his childhood. Then Javier looks in the distance and sees paradise and sees: It is biutiful.There are many other threads but I will leave it at that.

Swingers, years later, had me sprinting to the nearest club for a scotch. My coffee table still bears the scars inflicted after Inside Job. And Biutiful left me a weeping mess. After watching it, I spent fifteen minutes kissing the foreheads of my three sleeping children.This gritty tale from Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu about the final days of a minor league criminal named Uxbal (Javier Bardem, in an Oscar-nominated performance) finds moments of grace in a slog through life's unexpected miseries. Following a mystical opening set in a snowy forest, the film throws us into the protagonist's purgatory. Uxbal is not a bad guy. He arranges for illegal Chinese immigrants to work on construction sites and for illegal Senegalese immigrants to sell their black market wares. But he also makes sincere efforts to improve his exploitees' wretched existence.Uxbal's personal life is no better. His wife Marambra (Marical Alvarez) is bipolar, which has made their marriage unendurable, and he has taken their two adorable children, Ana (Hanaa Bouchaib) and Mateo (Guillermo Estrella), but he is far from an ideal father, and he knows it. At the risk of overdoing it in the misery department, Biutiful piles on Uxbal with terminal cancer. In a more traditional film, Uxbal would set his kids on the path to happiness and prosperity, cure his wife's mental problems, and liberate his minions from their indentured servitude. While Uxbal takes steps to achieve those goals with the help of a trusted friend, Biutiful employs no clich&eacute;d Hollywood triumphs.Bardem, who risked being forever typecast as a villain after No Country for Old Men, becomes Uxbal on screen; his haggard, handsome face sags after defeat compounds defeat. And he is granted only the briefest moments of peace. Shot with a handheld camera by Rodrigo Prieto in a Barcelona you won't see on the Travel Channel, Biutiful leaves the viewer spent, exhausted by Uxbal's struggle. I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has crafted an exquisitely sad movie, but for all its achievements the unrelenting misery of Biutiful dictates that the DVD will collect a lot of dust before it finds its way back into the player.Extras include a making-of documentary, subtitles and a theatrical trailer.Review originally appeared on MyDVDInsider.com.",3,Bardem shines in wearying slog through a miserable life,1309305600,"06 29, 2011",2011,2413,"['Movies', 'can', 'spark', 'strong', 'reactions', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'made', 'profess', 'love', 'high', 'school', 'sweetheart', 'Swingers', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'sprinting', 'nearest', 'club', 'scotch', 'coffee', 'table', 'still', 'scars', 'inflicted', 'Inside', 'Job', 'Biutiful', 'left', 'weeping', 'mess', 'watching', 'spent', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'kissing', 'foreheads', 'three', 'sleeping', 'children.This', 'gritty', 'tale', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'final', 'days', 'minor', 'league', 'criminal', 'named', 'Uxbal', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'moments', 'grace', 'slog', 'life', 'unexpected', 'miseries', 'Following', 'mystical', 'opening', 'set', 'snowy', 'forest', 'film', 'protagonist', 'purgatory', 'Uxbal', 'not', 'bad', 'guy', 'illegal', 'Chinese', 'immigrants', 'work', 'construction', 'sites', 'illegal', 'Senegalese', 'immigrants', 'sell', 'black', 'market', 'wares', 'also', 'sincere', 'efforts', 'improve', 'exploitees', 'wretched', 'existence.Uxbal', 'personal', 'life', 'better', 'wife', 'Marambra', 'Marical', 'Alvarez', 'bipolar', 'made', 'marriage', 'unendurable', 'taken', 'two', 'adorable', 'children', 'Ana', 'Hanaa', 'Bouchaib', 'Mateo', 'Guillermo', 'Estrella', 'far', 'ideal', 'father', 'risk', 'overdoing', 'misery', 'department', 'Biutiful', 'Uxbal', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'more', 'traditional', 'film', 'Uxbal', 'would', 'set', 'kids', 'path', 'happiness', 'prosperity', 'cure', 'wife', 'mental', 'problems', 'liberate', 'minions', 'indentured', 'servitude', 'Uxbal', 'steps', 'achieve', 'goals', 'help', 'trusted', 'friend', 'Biutiful', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Hollywood', 'triumphs.Bardem', 'who', 'risked', 'being', 'forever', 'typecast', 'villain', 'Country', 'Old', 'Men', 'Uxbal', 'screen', 'haggard', 'handsome', 'face', 'sags', 'defeat', 'compounds', 'defeat', 'granted', 'only', 'briefest', 'moments', 'peace', 'Shot', 'handheld', 'camera', 'Rodrigo', 'Prieto', 'Barcelona', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'Travel', 'Channel', 'Biutiful', 'viewer', 'spent', 'exhausted', 'Uxbal', 'struggle', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'rritu', 'crafted', 'exquisitely', 'sad', 'movie', 'achievements', 'unrelenting', 'misery', 'Biutiful', 'DVD', 'will', 'collect', 'lot', 'dust', 'way', 'back', 'player.Extras', 'include', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'subtitles', 'theatrical', 'trailer.Review', 'originally', 'appeared', 'MyDVDInsider.com']",N/A

1381152,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0041KKYF6,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 12]","""Biutiful"", the new film starring Javier Bardem, features one of his best, most passionate performances. As you watch, you will feel uncomfortable and uneasy. You may even dislike the film because of this. But there is no way Bardem's performance can be viewed as anything but superb. (This statement? Julia Roberts approved!)I felt all of these things as I watched this new film from writer and director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""21 Grams"", ""Babel"", ""Amores Perros""). But I ultimately didn't like the film much.""Biutiful"" seems like a very personal project for the director. Many filmmakers have made very personal films and this combination usually provides a moving, emotional journey for us. But Inarritu doesn't seem like he trusts his own vision, his own voice. Instead of telling the intimate, personal story of one man facing his own mortality, the director doesn't seem confident in his own story and seems to think he needs to make the film more important, more meaningful. To accomplish this, he uses this intimate story as a backdrop for an overly complicated epic. If you are familiar with ""Babel"" or ""21 Grams"", you will recognize Inarritu in the narrative; he likes to tell stories about different sets of people held together by a common bond. In some films, the bond is very strong, very explicit. In others, the bond can be more tenuous. He also frequently plays with time, chopping up the story into non-sequential chunks, jumping back and forth between the stories. This style is interesting and slightly unusual, giving us unique insight into the other stories. But in ""Biutiful"", all of these techniques only seem distracting. Because of this, he adds a bunch of unnecessary and distracting characters, subplots and storylines.Uxbal is really the only person we care about; and we want to get to know more about him. Everything else seems superfluous. Uxbal is a single father who lives on the fringe of society, his hands in a number of illegal activities. He coordinates the sale of counterfeit goods, using an army of African immigrants to hawk the wares and run from the frequent police stings. He is also working with the Chinese factory owner to expand their illegal activities. And he has an ex-wife who wants to be a part of his life again, and see their kids more often. But she is a busy prostitute and Uxbal would rather not have her around the children. Oh, and Uxbal learns he is very sick.Bardem seems to lose himself, to become this man, a man who is quickly losing control of his life. His control is already tenuous, but when he learns the upsetting news everything begins to move faster and he becomes more desperate. It is always fun to watch Bardem and in this film, he seems to connect with the character and the story like never before. It would be nice to be able to watch his performance and not have the extra distractions. And because the subject matter is so dark, Uxbal is also his most difficult character to watch.  It is an award worthy performance. (This statement is approved by Julia Roberts.)Julia Roberts has been holding screenings of this film for her fellow Screen Actors Guild members. Apparently, she was so moved by her ""Eat, Drink, Love"" co-star's performance and disturbed by the lack of accolades and early awards, she reportedly kicked her efforts up a notch. It seems to have worked. Bardem was just nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.Much like his previous films, Inarittu is not afraid to depict the gritty underbelly of his stories. In ""Biutiful"", Uxbal and the other characters in the film inhabit a very dirty, vibrant, complex and slightly seedy Madrid. Uxbal seems to know all of the ins and outs, the secret places, how to navigate the dark corners and how to hide quickly. And we travel there with him. Much of what he sees and does seems to rub off on us as we watch, giving us an unpleasant feeling. We almost feel grimy, like we need to take a shower after watching the film. This is great, given the subject matter, because he really makes us feel like we are walking along Uxbal.But again, even this seems to be diluted by the other unnecessary characters and subplots. We watch as the Chinese factory owner deals with the pressures of trying to remain traditional while feeling the temptations of his true self. We watch as an African immigrant has to deal with raising her new baby on her own. We watch as Uxbal's wife tries to become a part of the family again, trying to deal with her profession. We watch one of the recent Chinese immigrants caring for Uxbal's children, while she tries to acclimate to her new environment.The film is dedicated to Inarritu's father, leading me to believe this is his version of a story about his father's life. Inarittu may even be the inspiration for Uxbal's son. If Inarritu lived through some version of this as a young man, he had a truly extraordinary life. It is perplexing that he didn't seem to feel the power of just this story. This story alone would make a complex, riveting film. All of the extraneous, overly complicated additions only serve to dilute the power of the rest of the film.""Biutiful"" is an okay film with a great performance. Catch it on DVD.

Pretty Woman is very mad at you thornhill.)",3,Barden is great in an overly complicated film,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",2011,5302,"['Biutiful', 'new', 'film', 'starring', 'Javier', 'Bardem', 'one',

He has to deal with his black market business falling apart, his bipolar wife (Alvarez) not being a good mother to thier kids, and being diagnosed with terminal cancer.  This movie is both heart-wrenching and amazing.  This movie will affect you on so many levels that it is actually hard to watch in some parts.  The fact that this movie is in Spanish and subtitled means many people will not watch. That is a terrible thing to think about. This is easily one of the best movies to be released, not only this year, but also in the last few years. I really like Colin Firth and ""The King's Speech"" was fantastic, but Javier Bardem not winning Best Actor at the Oscars this year in my opinion is one of the biggest oversights in recent years.  This is a absolute must see movie, and in a week with very poor to horrible releases this one far and away stands out as the best.  I just hope people give it the chance that it deserves.  Watch it, then tell your friends about it.  An absolutely tremendous film.  I easily give it an A+.Would I watch again? - It is excellent, but very hard to watch in some parts.  Not sure I could do it again.*Also try - Babel & Hereafter",5,"Heart-wrenching and amazing. A must see movie, but hard to watch more then once. Bardem should have won best actor.

But Bardem gives an a one performance as usual.  Every role he plays is done with such class and perfection that is the reason for the 5 stars.  I cannot give it less with a performance such as his.,5,Bardem is a star,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,335,"['Bardem', 'performance', 'best', 'thing', 'strange', 'disjointed', 'movie', 'was', 'find', 'saying', 'what', 'was', 'Bardem', 'one', 'performance', 'usual', 'role', 'done', 'such', 'class', 'perfection', 'reason', '5', 'stars', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'less', 'performance', 'such']",N/A
