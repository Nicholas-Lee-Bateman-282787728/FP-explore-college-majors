As another viewer correctly states, there are three  songs from the last show substituted at the end of the first set, but I  happen to find their presence very valuable. &quot;Desolation Row&quot; is  a nice understated version, with chilling harmony from Jerry near the end,  and I found the &quot;West L.A.&quot; to be a fiery performance to rank  near the best.  My only quibble (well, a Deadhead has to quibble!) is not  enought Primal Dead.  &quot;The Other One&quot; would have been nice!

508336,A10WFDD7STQ95Q,B00000JXVL,Mr Pragmatic,"[4, 5]","I was at this show, which was excellent. The quality of the DVD is also excellent. So what is missing?Well, you know, you really had to be there. Once you've seen the Dead enough times the recordings are awesome because you can extrapolate what it really sounded like. I feel for those who've never seen them. They'll never really know.The sound by then was incredible. I don't think it can be reproduced in someone's home. You'd have to turn up a really clean sound system extremely loud and listen from another room. I mean shaking the neighbors pictures off the wall loud. And maybe sit in the neighbors yard. In a live show the dynamics are so wide you'll just never get that at home. I recall a crescendo so powerful the crowd began cheering. On the DVD you can barely hear the cheering and you wonder why they are.So I have mixed feelings about this. The quality of the DVD is about the best you can get, but after being there it reminds me we only have tape of Jerry now. The show is good, but they had so many great shows, it's too bad more of those weren't captured. 1982 is still my favorite Alpine show. Everybody was dancing. I mean you had to dance through the aisles just to stop bumping into people.I initially hated the Dead and thought they were awful. But after seeing them the first couple of times, even those old CD's are incredible. Most musicians are talented but play predictably. A few have a knack for finding these awesome grooves. But Jerry played from so many places you don't know how he thought to put a bluegrass riff here or a gorgeous accent there. Switching style, key signatures, rhythms like a technician, yet putting it all together into this wonderful cohesive whole, what at first listen sounds like ramblings gradually blossoms into a symphonic adventure. The 100th time you continue to find new subtexts, and as you delve into the music he learned from, you just marvel at how he kept all that in his head and wove it into his art.So here is a little glimpse of one of those rare characters that make life so fascinating. Each point in his career is interesting. Lacking a bit of the youthful unpredictability, here is an experienced musician, playing extremely well. Surrounded by one of the top rhythm guitarists in the business, one of the most original bass players, and extraordinary keyboards and percussion, this one is a no-brainer.",5,Mixed Feelings,1191024000,"09 29, 2007",2007,2382,"['was', 'show', 'was', 'excellent', 'quality', 'DVD', 'also', 'excellent', 'what', 'missing', 'Well', 'know', 'really', 'had', 'be', 'there', 'Once', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Dead', 'enough', 'times', 'recordings', 'are', 'awesome', 'can', 'extrapolate', 'what', 'really', 'sounded', 'feel', 'who', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'know.The', 'sound', 'then', 'was', 'incredible', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'be', 'reproduced', 'someone', 'home', ""'d"", 'have', 'turn', 'up', 'really', 'clean', 'sound', 'system', 'extremely', 'loud', 'listen', 'room', 'mean', 'shaking', 'neighbors', 'wall', 'loud', 'maybe', 'sit', 'neighbors', 'yard', 'live', 'show', 'dynamics', 'are', 'so', 'wide', ""'ll"", 'just', 'never', 'get', 'home', 'recall', 'crescendo', 'so', 'powerful', 'crowd', 'began', 'cheering', 'DVD', 'can', 'barely', 'hear', 'cheering', 'wonder', 'why', 'are.So', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'quality', 'DVD', 'best', 'can', 'get', 'being', 'only', 'have', 'tape', 'Jerry', 'now', 'show', 'good', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'great', 'shows', 'too', 'bad', 'more', 'were', ""n't"", 'captured', '1982', 'still', 'favorite', 'Alpine', 'show', 'Everybody', 'was', 'dancing', 'mean', 'had', 'dance', 'aisles', 'just', 'stop', 'bumping', 'people.I', 'initially', 'hated', 'Dead', 'thought', 'were', 'awful', 'seeing', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'even', 'old', 'CD', 'are', 'incredible', 'Most', 'musicians', 'are', 'talented', 'play', 'predictably', 'few', 'have', 'knack', 'finding', 'awesome', 'grooves', 'Jerry', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'places', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'thought', 'put', 'bluegrass', 'riff', 'here', 'gorgeous', 'accent', 'there', 'Switching', 'style', 'key', 'signatures', 'rhythms', 'technician', 'yet', 'putting', 'together', 'wonderful', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'what', 'first', 'listen', 'sounds', 'ramblings', 'gradually', 'blossoms', 'symphonic', 'adventure', '100th', 'time', 'continue', 'find', 'new', 'subtexts', 'delve', 'music', 'learned', 'just', 'marvel', 'how', 'kept', 'head', 'wove', 'art.So', 'here', 'little', 'glimpse', 'one', 'rare', 'characters', 'make', 'life', 'so', 'fascinating', 'point', 'career', 'interesting', 'Lacking', 'bit', 'youthful', 'unpredictability', 'here', 'experienced', 'musician', 'playing', 'extremely', 'well', 'Surrounded', 'one', 'top', 'rhythm', 'guitarists', 'business', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'bass', 'players', 'extraordinary', 'keyboards', 'percussion', 'one', 'no-brainer']",N/A

It looks just fine.The music is about as good as any show from that period.  You won't get golfballs from a walnut tree, and you won't get truly classic Dead from 1989.  With some exceptions, the jams had gotten shorter, and the shows more formulaic. Everyone has his own preferred setlist, and mine happens not to include Let the Good Times Roll (ZZZZ) or Johnny B. Goode (many others do it better), but Garcia was fully capable of playing inspired music at that point and he does so here, in China Cat (goosebumps), for example, or The Wheel (lovely and ethereal).  I loved seeing him beam beatifically at Brent, who gazes at him with the face of an adoring puppy, and launch into the kind of intricate, melodic run that only Garcia could do, with the most relaxed expression on his face.  It's true that he looks twenty years older than he was -- that's what fifteen years of the Persian, Haagen-Dazs, and channeling the energy we all wanted from him will do, I suppose -- and it's sad, but he lived the life he wanted, and we were the beneficiaries.It's a solid performance, with nuggets to amuse any fan, and a well-filmed production thankfully free of ""trippy"" gimmicks.",4,Excellent Example of 80's Dead,1152489600,"07 10, 2006",2006,1320,"['First', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'one', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'how', 'bad', 'video', 'supposedly', 'Rubbish', 'reviewer', 'new', 'DVD', 'player', 'just', 'fine.The', 'music', 'as', 'good', 'show', 'period', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'golfballs', 'walnut', 'tree', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'truly', 'classic', 'Dead', '1989', 'exceptions', 'jams', 'had', 'gotten', 'shorter', 'shows', 'more', 'formulaic', 'Everyone', 'own', 'preferred', 'setlist', 'mine', 'not', 'include', 'Let', 'Good', 'Times', 'Roll', 'ZZZZ', 'Johnny', 'B.', 'Goode', 'many', 'others', 'do', 'better', 'Garcia', 'was', 'fully', 'capable', 'playing', 'inspired', 'music', 'point', 'so', 'here', 'China', 'Cat', 'goosebumps', 'example', 'Wheel', 'lovely', 'ethereal', 'loved', 'seeing', 'beam', 'beatifically', 'Brent', 'who', 'face', 'adoring', 'puppy', 'launch', 'kind', 'intricate', 'melodic', 'run', 'only', 'Garcia', 'could', 'do', 'most', 'relaxed', 'expression', 'face', 'true', 'twenty', 'years', 'older', 'was', 'what', 'fifteen', 'years', 'Persian', 'Haagen-Dazs', 'channeling', 'energy', 'wanted', 'will', 'do', 'suppose', 'sad', 'lived', 'life', 'wanted', 'were', 'beneficiaries.It', 'solid', 'performance', 'nuggets', 'amuse', 'fan', 'well-filmed', 'production', 'thankfully', 'free', 'trippy', 'gimmicks']",N/A

508340,A1IHRMDF53HY4Z,B00000JXVL,Spackler,"[6, 6]","This is certainly one of the top 10 ""China>Rider""'s the band ever played. Holding its own against many from the holy era of `72-'74. The intro. by Bob, Jerry and Brent is excellent and intricate. The camera angle is perfect, though brief, in capturing Weir's intro. and is proof of how great a guitarist he is. He is often too underrated, sometimes venomously. He delivers his ""sun gonna shine"" line powerfully. But this is trounced by latter day Jerry nailing his ""headlight"" line and wailing away through out. There is plenty of JEF (Jerry emotional factor) on this one and the whole show in general. The jam between the two songs has Jerry shredding and making spiraling spaghetti notes on his Tiger guitar and wrapping them around any and all within earshot. Brent is sonically painting away. Lesh is thumping all along but finally begins to emerge out front with a pulsing ""Rider"" gallop and is in the Zone. The Rhythm Devils are clearly in sync. ""It"" is happening.The song choice is excellent and well played. Even the obligatory show opening ""Let The Good Times Roll"" is nicely played. Other highlights include a rare, for the year, ""All Over Now"" and an ever increasingly rare ""Cumberland"". The ""Deal"", actually from two nights later, has a heaping scoop of cherry Garcia. A ""Playing>UJB"" is always nice no matter how many times you've heard it. This leads to another emotive performance by Jerry playing an excellent ""SOTM"". By placing his ballad in pre-drums this allows the band to rock out of drums with a ""Wheel>Gimme Some Lovin'>GDTRFB>NFA"" trainload of good ol' Grateful Dead. Then the band stuns everyone and brings them to their knees with the first breakout of  ""We Bid You Good Night"" since 12/31/78. `Nuff said.
