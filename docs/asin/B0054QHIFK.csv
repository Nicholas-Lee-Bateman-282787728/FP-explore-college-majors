Proctor ""Danny52""","[0, 0]","When Peter, Paul & Mary came to Nashville to record their 25th Anniversary Concert for PBS in 1986, I was fortunate to attend. Recorded in Nashville's Tennessee Performing Arts Center in Jackson Hall, the concert was taped on two consecutive nights. We were there on the second night and there was a bit of concern when Mary's beautiful necklace broke, fearing the footage wouldn't match the previous night's recording. Sure enough, you can see that Mary's necklace is missing toward the end of the concert. A fan for many years, I was not disappointed. I am still amazed to hear how full their sound is with nothing more than two guitars, Dick Kniss on the upright bass and those three glorious voices. It was a sweet, unforgettable show and this DVD somehow managed to capture the feel in the room. The music is so infectious that the audience sings along whether prompted or not. I count myself blessed to have heard them in their prime before we lost dear Mary Travers. Any fan of PP&M will cherish this DVD.",5,An eyewitness to this concert ...

1441991,A366S12KCZ280V,B0054QHIFK,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 1]","Over the years I have seen on TV several concerts of various performers and have collected on DVD abd VHS as well. Of all the concerts I have watched on TV or DVD ""Peter Paul and Mary's 25th Anniversary Concert just might be the best of the best I have seen. I write that not because I am a hugh fam of PP&M; (althought it is true I am) but because the atmosphere that was going on inside the Tennessee Performing Arts Center that night the concert was being recorded. Peter Paul And Mary have been a major contributor to the world of music since the early 1960's when folk music was at its height in popularity. Their songs, especially the lyrics, brought attention to the political issues that was facing society and helped inspire society to meet those issues head on correct the problems that were hindering progress. Folk music doesn't hold the attention of the majority of the public nowadays as it did back fourty or fifty years ago but it doesn't make the songs any less important or inspiring. Sadly too some of those issues that folk music was addressing way back then are still with us today and still hindering the progress of society to become greater.But one night 25 years ago all the hopes and enthusiasm that folk music could bring out in people occurred with the trio of Peter Paul and Mary leading once again the way. During the concert PP&M; would sing all of the songs we have come to associate with them. They touched all emotions as they weaved through their line up of songs they played. There was a little something for everyone. Songs of humour, hope, protest, remembrence and all with some nostalgia thrown in as well. Just about all of the songs on the concert you know. The concert is also a perfect blend of newer songs they wrote combined together with their well known and loved hits. It all combines together to create a true concert event. What to me makes this so enjoyable to watch is to see the reaction to the audience as the concert goes on. Everyone in the audience seemed to get right into the spirit of the concert right from the beginning. The camera shots that are shown throughtout the performance shows everyone really getting into the music and the emotions coming from the music. Just about every song the audience is singing along too and in a couple of cases PP and M stop singing themselves and let the audience take over singing the lyrics. It seemed that as it progressed along both Peter Paul and Mary and the audience were feeding off each others emotions that were coming forth which just helped bring an electricity into the air that made the whole evening become so special. I remember the first time I watched it,on our local PBS station, I thought how much I wish I had been there to be a part of what was taking place.I did get the concert on VHS after seeing it on TV but that was many years ago and the tape is wearing out now. The good news though is that in memory to that 25th anniversary concert 25 years later it is being released on DVD. I of course will plan on getting me a copy and I strongly recommend you getting yourself a copy to. Especially if your are a fan of PP&M;, this is a must to have. I would also recommend this to anyone who is not familier with the music of Peter Paul and Mary. This concert I think makes an excellant introdution to the spirit and love as well as the music of this greatest of folk music trios.",5,A True Concert Event,1333584000,"04 5, 2012",2012,3400,"['years', 'have', 'seen', 'TV', 'several', 'concerts', 'various', 'performers', 'have', 'collected', 'DVD', 'abd', 'VHS', 'as', 'well', 'concerts', 'have', 'watched', 'TV', 'DVD', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'Concert', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'write', 'not', 'am', 'hugh', 'fam', 'PP', 'M', 'true', 'am', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'going', 'Tennessee', 'Performing', 'Arts', 'Center', 'night', 'concert', 'was', 'being', 'recorded', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'contributor', 'world', 'music', 'early', '1960', 'when', 'folk', 'music', 'was', 'height', 'popularity', 'songs', 'especially', 'lyrics', 'brought', 'attention', 'political', 'issues', 'was', 'facing', 'society', 'helped', 'inspire', 'society', 'meet', 'issues', 'head', 'correct', 'problems', 'were', 'hindering', 'progress', 'Folk', 'music', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'majority', 'public', 'nowadays', 'did', 'back', 'fourty', 'fifty', 'years', 'ago', ""n't"", 'make', 'songs', 'less', 'important', 'inspiring', 'Sadly', 'too', 'issues', 'folk', 'music', 'was', 'addressing', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'are', 'still', 'today', 'still', 'hindering', 'progress', 'society', 'become', 'greater.But', 'one', 'night', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'hopes', 'enthusiasm', 'folk', 'music', 'could', 'bring', 'out', 'people', 'occurred', 'trio', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'leading', 'once', 'again', 'way', 'concert', 'PP', 'M', 'would', 'sing', 'songs', 'have', 'come', 'associate', 'touched', 'emotions', 'weaved', 'line', 'songs', 'played', 'was', 'little', 'something', 'everyone', 'Songs', 'humour', 'hope', 'protest', 'remembrence', 'nostalgia', 'thrown', 'as', 'well', 'Just', 'songs', 'concert', 'know', 'concert', 'also', 'perfect', 'blend', 'newer', 'songs', 'wrote', 'combined', 'together', 'well', 'known', 'loved', 'hits', 'together', 'create', 'true', 'concert', 'event', 'What', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'see', 'reaction', 'audience', 'concert', 'Everyone', 'audience', 'seemed', 'get', 'right', 'spirit', 'concert', 'right', 'beginning', 'camera', 'shots', 'are', 'shown', 'performance', 'everyone', 'really', 'getting', 'music', 'emotions', 'coming', 'music', 'Just', 'song', 'audience', 'singing', 'along', 'too', 'couple', 'cases', 'PP', 'M', 'stop', 'singing', 'let', 'audience', 'take', 'singing', 'lyrics', 'seemed', 'progressed', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'audience', 'were', 'feeding', 'off', 'others', 'emotions', 'were', 'coming', 'forth', 'just', 'helped', 'bring', 'electricity', 'air', 'made', 'whole', 'evening', 'become', 'so', 'special', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'thought', 'how', 'much', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'be', 'part', 'what', 'was', 'taking', 'place.I', 'did', 'get', 'concert', 'VHS', 'seeing', 'TV', 'was', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'tape', 'wearing', 'out', 'now', 'good', 'news', 'though', 'memory', '25th', 'anniversary', 'concert', '25', 'years', 'later', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'course', 'will', 'plan', 'getting', 'copy', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'copy', 'Especially', 'are', 'fan', 'PP', 'M', 'must', 'have', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'familier', 'music', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'Mary', 'concert', 'think', 'excellant', 'introdution', 'spirit', 'love', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'greatest', 'folk', 'music', 'trios']",N/A

There really doesn't seem to be enough videos of this group, (I could only find one other DVD), so I jumped at the chance to get this DVD.Four songs have always stood out for me and they are ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone,"" ""Blowin In The Wind,"" ""Leaving On A Jet Plane,"" and ""If I Had A Hammer"".  There is one more song that I absolutely love and it is actually Paul's solo song, called ""Wedding Song (There is Love)"".  This highly spiritual song was presented as a special and unique wedding gift from Paul to Peter and his bride at their wedding.  All these songs are in this DVD and I found them enjoyable to watch.The concert was recorded in 1986, so the DVD quality looks slightly dated and a little fuzzy (grainy) on a 1080 high def TV.  If you have older DVDs you probably know what I mean.  On a 720 high def TV, closeups look OK and the background audience was a littly fuzzy.Audio sounds fine on the regular speakers of the 1080 high def TV.  Audio sounds great on an audio system.
