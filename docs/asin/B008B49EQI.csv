It was written by friends of mine and I really wanted to think this was a must see movie. The message was one that needs to be brought to the world.  Young girls need to be made aware of the ramifications for their future when they opt to go through an abortion. And Christians who fight tooth and claw against abortion need to be ready to help candidates for an abortion deal with an unwanted pregnancy through love and caring instead of judgmentalism. You know the axiom: hate the sin but love the sinner. The complaint I had about this movie was some skewed realism - which I can't discuss in detail without spoiling the ending of this movie. You might have zippo problem accepting this approach. I'm just too bogged down in pragmatism to accept this without mentioning that this story used a gimmick that some people might think is cool and mysterious, but it messed with my mind. If you're in the group who accepts the gimmick (like the Dove reviewer), you might love this flick.

It winds up that this movie was nothingmore than a long anti abortion commercial.  The movie was designed to shame any woman for the choice she made.  The writers decided that they should let women know that whether the woman knows it or not she will never get over the abortion she decided to have.  It was designed in a way to show women that they really aren't smart enough to know what is best for them.  They make the assumption that all women are the same and that they will regret their choice and be plagued with it all their days.  The movie shows how a group of people think that they should have the right to make choices for you.  I started noticing how often the wife was basically dismissed of her feelings of her past choices and then to have her husband say get over it was just it.I will be sure and not watch anything else that comes out of Pure Flix Ent.I feel like I was duped into watching this movie.And please do not feel that you need to respond with your thoughts on abortion.,1,Nothing more than a really long commercial,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2014,1097,"['are', 'looking', 'movie', 'specific', 'ideology', 'then', 'movie', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'nothingmore', 'long', 'anti', 'abortion', 'commercial', 'movie', 'was', 'designed', 'shame', 'woman', 'choice', 'made', 'writers', 'decided', 'should', 'let', 'women', 'know', 'woman', 'not', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'abortion', 'decided', 'have', 'was', 'designed', 'way', 'show', 'women', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'what', 'best', 'make', 'assumption', 'women', 'are', 'same', 'will', 'regret', 'choice', 'be', 'plagued', 'days', 'movie', 'how', 'group', 'people', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'right', 'make', 'choices', 'started', 'noticing', 'how', 'often', 'wife', 'was', 'basically', 'dismissed', 'feelings', 'past', 'choices', 'then', 'have', 'husband', 'say', 'get', 'was', 'just', 'it.I', 'will', 'be', 'sure', 'not', 'watch', 'anything', 'else', 'Pure', 'Flix', 'Ent.I', 'feel', 'was', 'duped', 'watching', 'movie.And', 'please', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'need', 'respond', 'thoughts', 'abortion']",N/A
