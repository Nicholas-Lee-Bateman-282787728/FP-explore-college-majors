Translation: An anvil falls on your head; you get crumpled but walk away alive!And that sums up the A Team.  They blow things up; they fire enough amunition to fight a war; they create make-shift defense vehicles (Hum V's without the paint job :) ) and get the bad guys,--amazingly,--without ever having to kill them.  I do not know about you; but if I shot machine guns in the opposite direction of a person, a bullet at least once or twice would ricochet and kill the bad guy.  Not so with Hannibal and the gang.  They aim directly at them; and they never hit a man.  A helicopter flew into the side of a mountain, exploded, fell half a mile; and still every bad guy piled out dazed but unharmed.  Ridiculous!I've always wanted to do: The A Team: The Bloody Cut! :)Limbs flying everywhere; blood splattered bodies, no men crawling out of any destroyed vehicle.  With today's technology, it could be done with a few select episodes; and it would be a hoot.  I figure these guys killed about 50 men per episode.  If we really wanted to count the bodied ""not shown"".Plot: They are an expert tactical team from the Vietnam War, accused of a crime they didn't commit; and they are on the run.  They live in the ""Underbelly"" of L.A. but refuse to leave their country.  Why?  It's there country; and they still believe in it.  They'll solve their ""minor differences"" with the govt. in time.  Oh; and they help the helpless to fight the bad guys.  Sometimes for great profit; and others for free.  Circumstances pending.  But then most know this; and if you do not: you know it now.One serious flaw after A Team Season 1 DVD Set:  Seasons 2, 3, and 4 are double-sided, dual-layered.  This spells major trouble, especially coming from Universal.  The studio that took DVD and made VHS look good!I start with Season 2 simply because these are where the flaws begin.  So far, on Disc One, there has cropped up a situation where the DVD pauses for more time than it should: I should say it freezes, then jumps a second to the next frame.  This has occurred in two episodes: ""The Only Church In Town"" (once); and ""When You Comin Back, Range Rider?"" (multiple times.  Big problems with this episode).  The eps play; but it is a freeze; and not a normal dual-layer pause.Universal, always on the cheap, should have gone with one-sided dual-layered discs.  The normal pause might occur; but I had no problems with Season One with the discs,--which had only one side.It has beens suggested in a review on this site, these defective discs can be returned to Universal with replacements provided.  I shall give it a try; and see if I can get replacement discs free of charge.But beware!  Some players may handle it one time--the freezing; others may read every flaw.  But the defects are there, even if one of your players can take the heat of these cheaply made discs.I like the A Team; but I do not like Universal DVD productions.  Most are really just put the film on the DVD, flaws and all.  No enhancements; no extras.  Then add defects as I have just described, and it makes for lousy viewing--in spots.A Team?

Short for ""Alpha Team,"" The A-Team is a Vietnam-era crack commando unit wrongfully accused of robbing the Bank of Hanoi. Having escaped from a maximum security prison, the four man team survives in the anonymity of the Los Angeles underground. And with the government still hot on their trail, they're forced to work as soldiers of fortune, providing aid and assistance to the helpless victims of various injustices...The A-Team is led by cigar aficionado Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith (George Peppard), a wise-cracking officer who always has a plan in the works. Hannibal is flanked by Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck (Dirk Benedict), the consummate ladies' man; Sgt. Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus (Mr. T), a gold-drenched muscleman afraid of flying; and Captain H.M ""Howling Mad"" Murdock, a lanky mental case who nevertheless carries out his missions with flawless precision. Together, they travel the country in B.A.'s trademark black van, fighting for justice and attempting to elude the clutches of the nefarious Colonel Decker (Lance LeGault) who wants nothing more in life than to capture The A-Team...The A-Team (Season 2) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""Diamonds 'N' Dust"" in which The A-Team is hired to transport explosives to a diamond mine in Zimbabwe after the owner of the mine is murdered in his attempt to deliver them himself... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Taxicab Wars"" in which a small, family-run taxicab company hires The A-Team to help them ward off the strong-arm tactics of a ruthless competitor, and ""The White Ballot"" in which Face's attempt to run against a corrupt sheriff tips off the government in regard to the whereabouts of The A-Team...Below is a list of episodes included on The A-Team (Season 2) DVD:Episode 15 (Diamonds 'N' Dust)Episode 16 (Recipe for Heavy Bread)Episode 17 (The Only Church in Town)Episode 18 (Bad Time on the Border)Episode 19 (When You Comin' Back, Range Rider?

The opening title explains that they were accused of a crime they did not commit in 1972 and escaped. They are now soldiers of fortune and if you can find them, maybe they can help you. The A-Team ran on NBC for five seasons between 1983 and 1987. The show starred George Peppard ""Hannibal,"" Dirk Benedict ""Face,"" Dwight Schultz ""Murdock"", and the colorful Mr. T as ""B.A. Baracus."" Melina Culea was a cast member during the first and for half of the second season of The A-Team. Her role on the show during the second season was very limited, and before the season would end she would be gone from the show. She would take part in the discussions prior to the action but when the fisticuffs started to fly she was no where to be found. It was also hard to believe that she was the attractive woman with these four men but not romantically involved with any of them.They traveled the country in their trademark black van. The missions that they took part in seemed to just fall into place for them. A lot of times it was being in the right place at the right time. Whatever the mission was you could expect a few punches to be thrown and a fast paced action scene which could include a fast car chance. In the episode ""Labor Pains,"" they helped a group of migrant workers establish a union.

(I'll be ignoring season 5, since I am one of those that believes that the show jumpes the shark in season 4, and nothing after that point was even close to being worth watching. [...].I won't review the episodes-- if you don't know what the show is like, you won't be buying the DVDS anyway.  I'll focus on the package itself.First, the image transfer seems a little dark to me.  Not muddy or anything-- but a little on the dark side.  Might be my imagination.Second, I applaud the decision to go with slim-DVD cases for each disc (contrast with the fold-out package used for season 1) but I really hate double-sided DVDs.  There's no safe way to hold a double-sided DVD, and fixing scratches on them is a crap shoot, because you might damage the other side while you fix the scratched one.As for the bonus material, I could take or leave Knight Rider-- it was always one of those shows that I liked in theory but was bored with when it was actually on.  Kind of like Dukes of Hazzard or Star Wars Episode 1.That said, I'm thrilled to see The A-Team being released on DVD.

882544,A319SKSB556033,B0007LXP7W,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[40, 40]","I'll admit the first season of The A-Team (that's Alpha Team for the uninitiated) was a bit dodgy and had a rough quality to it. But season 2 is where the show really found it's groove and began to develop the characters and plots more. And you just gotta love all those silly inventions. But hey, it gets the job done. Season 2 also sees more guest appearances from more well-known actors such as Dennis Franz, Michael Ironside, Ken Foree, John Amos and the supercool Lance Henrickson.People often complain about the same things when moaning about The A-Team. They say that every show had the same plot. Well, this can be said about a lot of TV shows if you go into technicalities. But the A-Team diversified enough for this statement to be simply not true (a 2-hour episode is included in this season, for example). They also complain that no one ever got shot or died. Also not true. People do die. People are shot. Just not very often and certainly not by one of the team. I mean if they are on the run for a crime they didn't commit then it would be stupid of them to shoot people. And Amy just doesn't  disappear without a reason halfway through this season as so many people complain. Her character is made a foreign correspondent in Jakarta and is frequently referenced in her abesence. People just love to hate this show because it's easy to pick apart but I doubt something like Lost will be so fondly remembered in 20 years time. However I was kinda let down when the last episode turned out to be cheap clip-show.With rumors of an A-Team movie abound I have to express my disapproval, at the moment at least. Currently there are FAR TOO MANY old shows being made into heartless movies. Some of them were already worth nothing (Charlie's Angels, Honeymooners) but the A-Team was something special and there is NO WAY you can replace the original cast with Hollywood actors.The late, great George Peppard is the only Hannibal. I miss him. It's sad that he passed away at the too young age of 66 but you can really see what caused his illness when watching this show. He is always chomping on a cigar. George Peppard was a heavy smoker (and drinker) and although he quit both of them soon after the show it had already taken it's toll on him. It's a real shame and no one can replace him. And despite this coming in over 20 years after Breakfast at Tiffany's, there is still enough youthful handsomeness in him to prove the drink didn't really cripple his career.Dirk Benedict is the only Templeton 'Face' Peck. A man who lies and cons like there was no tomorrow. A man who wouldn't tell you the truth even if you held a gun to his grandmother's head. Only Dirk pulled this off perfectly and the role will always be his.Dwight Schultz often displays Jim Carrey-esque levels of zany humor as Murdock and there's no doubt the man is a terrific actor. Carrey could pull this off I guess but he's much older than Schultz was at the time and he did make Murdock into the wild, 'is he crazy or just faking it' character we all know and love.And finally there's Mr T. If I absolutely HAD to choose my fave Team member, if you really made me. I would be him. He's the one that gave the A-Team something special. And although his acting is a little amateur (he gradually got better) he's just hilarious.Of course you could bring back the original cast but Benedict, Schultz and T are all 60, 57 and 53 now and can you really imagine them taking orders from a new Hannibal? I don't think so!And then there's the A-Team theme music. THE best TV theme ever. There are, as of yet, undiscovered tribes in the heart of the amazon jungle that know and love the A-Team theme. Immediatly starting on a high and not letting up for 60 seconds of one of the most heroic fanfares ever...could there be a better theme tune than this? Never!The DVD presentation is just a little bit better than last time. The picture is still in desperate need of a digital remastering. Sometimes it can come across as very clear and colorful but too often the colors are washed out, bland and have a 'sun-bleached' look.The sound is okay. Nothing to write home about. But certainly no complaints.Extras this time consist of a bonus Knight Rider episode and trailers of A-Team Season 1, Miami Vice, Airwolf and Knight Rider.",5,Where the show really takes off.,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,4293,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'first', 'season', 'A-Team', 'Alpha', 'Team', 'uninitiated', 'was', 'bit', 'dodgy', 'had', 'rough', 'quality', 'season', '2', 'where', 'show', 'really', 'found', 'groove', 'began', 'develop', 'characters', 'plots', 'more', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'silly', 'inventions', 'job', 'done', 'Season', '2', 'also', 'more', 'guest', 'appearances', 'more', 'well-known', 'actors', 'such', 'Dennis', 'Franz', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'Ken', 'Foree', 'John', 'Amos', 'supercool', 'Lance', 'Henrickson.People', 'often', 'complain', 'same', 'things', 'when', 'moaning', 'A-Team', 'say', 'show', 'had', 'same', 'plot', 'Well', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'lot', 'TV', 'shows', 'go', 'technicalities', 'A-Team', 'diversified', 'enough', 'statement', 'be', 'simply', 'not', 'true', '2-hour', 'episode', 'included', 'season', 'example', 'also', 'complain', 'one', 'ever', 'got', 'shot', 'died', 'Also', 'not', 'true', 'People', 'do', 'die', 'People', 'are', 'shot', 'Just', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'certainly', 'not', 'one', 'team', 'mean', 'are', 'run', 'crime', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'shoot', 'people', 'Amy', 'just', ""n't"", 'disappear', 'reason', 'halfway', 'season', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'complain', 'character', 'made', 'foreign', 'correspondent', 'Jakarta', 'frequently', 'referenced', 'abesence', 'People', 'just', 'love', 'hate', 'show', 'easy', 'pick', 'apart', 'doubt', 'something', 'Lost', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'fondly', 'remembered', '20', 'years', 'time', 'However', 'was', 'kinda', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'last', 'episode', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'cheap', 'clip-show.With', 'rumors', 'A-Team', 'movie', 'abound', 'have', 'express', 'disapproval', 'moment', 'least', 'Currently', 'are', 'FAR', 'TOO', 'MANY', 'old', 'shows', 'being', 'made', 'heartless', 'movies', 'were', 'already', 'worth', 'nothing', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'Honeymooners', 'A-Team', 'was', 'something', 'special', 'WAY', 'can', 'replace', 'original', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'actors.The', 'late', 'great', 'George', 'Peppard', 'only', 'Hannibal', 'miss', 'sad', 'passed', 'away', 'too', 'young', 'age', '66', 'can', 'really', 'see', 'what', 'caused', 'illness', 'when', 'watching', 'show', 'always', 'chomping', 'cigar', 'George', 'Peppard', 'was', 'heavy', 'smoker', 'drinker', 'quit', 'soon', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'taken', 'toll', 'real', 'shame', 'one', 'can', 'replace', 'coming', '20', 'years', 'Breakfast', 'Tiffany', 'still', 'enough', 'youthful', 'handsomeness', 'prove', 'drink', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'cripple', 'career.Dirk', 'Benedict', 'only', 'Templeton', ""'Face"", 'Peck', 'A', 'man', 'who', 'cons', 'was', 'tomorrow', 'man', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'tell', 'truth', 'even', 'held', 'gun', 'grandmother', 'head', 'Only', 'Dirk', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfectly', 'role', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'his.Dwight', 'Schultz', 'often', 'Jim', 'Carrey-esque', 'levels', 'zany', 'humor', 'Murdock', 'doubt', 'man', 'terrific', 'actor', 'Carrey', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'guess', 'much', 'older', 'Schultz', 'was', 'time', 'did', 'make', 'Murdock', 'wild', 'just', 'faking', 'character', 'know', 'love.And', 'finally', 'Mr', 'T.', 'absolutely', 'HAD', 'choose', 'fave', 'Team', 'member', 'really', 'made', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'gave', 'A-Team', 'something', 'special', 'acting', 'little', 'amateur', 'gradually', 'got', 'better', 'just', 'hilarious.Of', 'course', 'could', 'bring', 'back', 'original', 'cast', 'Benedict', 'Schultz', 'T', 'are', '60', '57', '53', 'now', 'can', 'really', 'imagine', 'taking', 'orders', 'new', 'Hannibal', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'then', 'A-Team', 'theme', 'music', 'best', 'TV', 'theme', 'ever', 'are', 'yet', 'undiscovered', 'tribes', 'heart', 'amazon', 'jungle', 'know', 'love', 'A-Team', 'theme', 'Immediatly', 'starting', 'high', 'not', 'letting', 'up', '60', 'seconds', 'one', 'most', 'heroic', 'fanfares', 'ever', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'better', 'theme', 'tune', 'Never', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'better', 'last', 'time', 'picture', 'still', 'desperate', 'need', 'digital', 'remastering', 'can', 'come', 'very', 'clear', 'colorful', 'too', 'often', 'colors', 'are', 'washed', 'out', 'bland', 'have', ""'sun-bleached"", 'look.The', 'sound', 'okay', 'Nothing', 'write', 'home', 'certainly', 'complaints.Extras', 'time', 'consist', 'bonus', 'Knight', 'Rider', 'episode', 'trailers', 'A-Team', 'Season', '1', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Airwolf', 'Knight', 'Rider']",The A-Team: Season Two

Which I have to ask, why did I order it in the first place? To receive damaged discs, and not get a good set, and no resolve? The company still has more to sell, and yet, I have to get refunded instead of an offer of a replacement, and I had to over work my end to keep from being charged interest on the credit card, and also getting the package back to amazon.com so I won't be double charged.Dealing with Amazon.com straight, is much better for returns.  Fulfillment by Amazon Stinks because Amazon will not allow replacements.  Which I have to ask again, why bother making a purchase and dealing with a gamble that I may not get a good set? Why bother using a credit card? Sorry, I am rating this based on experience, this is not a nice thing to do to a customer.Once this issue gets resolved, I would give it 4 stars for being a good series.

John ""Hannibal"" Smith, the leader of the band of four men framed for a crime in Vietnam War. Hiring themselves as soldiers of fortune, Hannibal's crew includes Lt. Templeton ""Face"" Peck (Dirk Benedict), Baracus (Mr. T), and Capt. H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock (Dwight Schultz). Hannibal is a cocky leader but with a sense of humor; always ready to assist the poor and the needy. Face as a charming soldier and Murdoch as a crazy man and Baracus as the macho man of the team provide recipe for great TV series. One thing about The A-Team is the relationship between the four offbeat heroes who may not always like each other but get the job done to the complete satisfaction of their clients. In the process they bring entertainment to large number TV viewers.  The second season has many episodes that turn out to be some of the best of the series.

882559,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B0007LXP7W,Taheen Lopez,"[4, 4]","This 1983-84 Season DVD of THE A-TEAM is great even though most of this season left us mourning the loss of the sexy newspaper reporter(Amy Allen) along with the fact that THE A-TEAM was still in its honeymoon phase of the show along with the fact that this was also the season when Face gets his snazzy Corvette and the season when Lance LeGault joins the cast as the team's new hard-nosed Army nemesis(Col.Decker) & replaces his disgruntled predecessor Col. Lynch(Bill Lucking)along with the fact the 2nd Season had some interesting episodes like ""When You Coming Back Range Rider"", which showed clipped scenes from previous episodes from the 1st Season like the ""Mexican Slayride"" episode, ""Holiday In The Hills"" episode, and the ""One More Time"" episode when they explained why the team's equally incompetent nemesis Lynch was being replaced by Decker after Lynch's unsuccessful 10-year pursuit of the A-Team.I also thought it was cool how they used clipped scenes from previous episodes from both the 1st and 2nd Seasons of this show in the ""Curtain Call"" episode when the A-Team starts reminising about their past and recent experiences by showing us flashback memory recollections that Decker, Hannibal(George Peppard), Murdock(Dwight Schultz), Face(Dirk Benedict), and B.A.(Mr. T)all started having while the team struggled to keep Murdock alive after being shot while Decker is hot on the A-Team's trail close to snagging them once & for all along with the fact that ""Curtain Call"" was also the Season Finale episode to the 1983-1984 Season on NBC, but Decker strikes out again at the end of the episode despite the fact that Decker wanted to capture the A-Team more than anything in the world if its the last thing he did.On the other hand; I don't think the Second Season was quite as good as the First Season was, because of the fact that newspaper reporter Amy Allen(Melinda Culea) ended up leaving the team all of the sudden on such short notice in the second half of THE A-TEAM's 1983-84 Season since Culea was abruptly fired from the show in the mid Fall of 1983 after only the first 9 episodes of this season due to Culea being too tomboyish along with the fact that Peppard didn't get along well with Culea behind the set either.Therefore, you could say that Amy was kicked off the team after her last appearance in the ""Water, Water Everywhere"" episode without even mentioning a reason why Amy wasn't with them anymore as of the ""Steel"" episode when the A-TEAM went from being a fivesome to only a foursome all of the sudden leaving Amy no where to be found with the exception of ""The White Ballot"" episode when Amy gets shown one last time in December of 1983.Therefore, when Amy Allen's character was abruptly dropped from the show, it was kind of like when Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend Beth Davenport(Gretchen Corbett) abruptly departed THE ROCKFORD FILES in the Winter of 1978 since Gretchen Corbett left Rockford due to a salary dispute, since THE ROCKFORD FILES wasn't quite the same without Beth's beauty and cheery personality on the show.Unfortunately, most of the episodes of THE A-TEAM without Amy weren't as interesting and made this show go stale afterwhile even though Amy briefly got replaced by foxy newspaper reporter Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley)in the Winter of 1984 for the remainder of this season to work the outside for the team like her predecessor(Amy Allen) used to do when she made her first appearance in ""The Battle Of Bel Air"" episode, but Tawnia only ended up lasting 9 episodes unlike Amy, since Tawnia departed in the 3rd Season after only one episode in the Fall of 1984, which by the way was ""The Bend In The River"" episode when Tawnia helps the team find her kidnapped fiancee(Barry Van-Dyke)in Brazil before Tawnia and Bryan get married at the end of that episode before Tawnia moves away from L.A. and resigns from both team and the LA Courier resulting in THE A-TEAM becoming a foursome again leaving us to mourn the loss of both Tawnia & Amy in the 1984-85 Season.Additionally, even though Heasley had replaced Culea in the 2nd half of this season, Tawnia was nothing more than a part-time and trial co-star to the show and was never a full-time co-star like Amy was, because unlike Amy, Tawnia was never included in the introduction credits at the beginning of the show like Amy was in the 1st Season and during the first half of the 2nd Season and Tawnia was never even included in the half-time credits in the middle of each episode either as opposed to Amy.Therefore, Amy was actually more of a co-star on THE A-TEAM than Tawnia ever was, since Amy was a full-time co-star throughout the whole First Season and throughout the first 9 episodes of this season and I think Amy was actually more committed to the team and to the cast & crew of the show than Tawnia ever was too despite the fact that Tawnia was cuter than Amy was, because something else I noticed about this show was in each episode that Tawnia came out in, Tawnia was never shown as much as Amy was, even though Tawnia had replaced Amy as the 5th team member by temporarily making THE A-TEAM a fivesome again.Unfortunately, when Amy Allen suddenly left the show; Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock all acted as if Amy never even existed or like Amy was worthless to the team and like they didn't even miss Amy one bit, but I just wish that Amy would've stayed with the cast and crew of The A-Team and hadn't been fired from the show or that Tawnia would've at least became a permanent and full-time co-star on The A-Team by the 1984-85 Season instead of leaving the show in the Autumn of 1984.In addition to that, I think the team wasn't as sharp looking as they were in the 1st season either, but I think the 2nd Season would've been better if Tawnia Baker had became a permanent full-time co-star on this show like Amy was in the First Season and the first 9 episodes of the Second Season by showing Marla Heasley's name and face on the introduction credits of the show as well as the half-time credits like they did with Amy, but then Tawnia ended up leaving the show too in September of 1984, due to Peppard's insistence of not needing or wanting a female co-star on the show or team, which prompted Heasley's resignation and why Tawnia's name and face was never shown on the credits of the introduction of THE A-TEAM or even on the half-time credits and why Tawnia was never quite in every single episode in the second half of the 2nd Season even once she joined the cast & crew of the A-Team, like the ""Harder Than It Looks"" episode and the ""Semi-Friendly Persuasion"" episode for instance, which technically made the ""Curtain Call"" episode Tawnia's last appearance on the show with the exception of ""The Bend In The River"" episode, since Tawnia didn't appear in the ""Bullets & Bikinis"" episode, which by the way was the Season Premiere of the A-TEAM's 3rd Season.Therefore, this show seemed to have gotten weaker and weaker each season and was becoming less & less impressive as the seasons progressed since the team wasn't as interesting to watch without Amy or Tawnia on the show, especially without Amy and without Tawnia on the show, since most of the 2nd Season didn't have Amy anymore for instance and since the 3rd Season didn't have Tawnia anymore either with the exception of ""The Bend In The River"" episode, which therefore left the show with no more female co-stars, since there was no more Amy or Tawnia from the Third Season on up, which really sucked and made this show become stale when this program hit its 3rd Season on NBC which is another reason why I stopped watching the A-TEAM afterwhile, since the show wasn't quite the same anymore without Amy or Tawnia's pizzaz and spunky personalities.It's just too bad that the producers of THE A-TEAM didn't decide to make Tawnia Baker(Marla Heasley) a permanent and full-time co-star of the show in the 3rd Season or that they didn't bring Amy Allen(Melinda Culea) back to the show after Tawnia departed either or that they didn't find a female co-star to replace Tawnia in the 3rd Season either, but Peppard along with the rest of the cast & crew of this show didn't want a female co-star and felt that this show did better without any lady co-stars and by just having the 4 of them on the team making it a strictly mans only team in order to make THE A-TEAM strictly a mans show since they obviously didn't have very good luck with keeping Culea or Heasley on the show, since there was tension between Culea and Peppard in the whole 1st Season and in the first half of the 2nd Season and since there was tension between Heasley and all the 4 main characters of this show, which of course were Peppard, Mr. T, Benedict, and Schultz since none of the cast & crew wanted Heasley on the show in the first place, due to the fact that Peppard felt that the show did much better without a female co-star and better with just the 4 of them, since Peppard felt that the lady co-stars were like a distraction to viewers of the show since Peppard felt that viewers paid more attention to the smiles and hot looks of Amy & Tawnia more than they paid attention to the genuine heavy-duty action that Hannibal, BA, Face, and Murdock all did on the show whenever they had a plan and accomplished a mission on each episode.But when Amy was kicked off the team and then when Tawnia was kicked off the team, Peppard felt that it helped viewers of this show pay a lot more attention to the heavy-duty action and stunts on this show, since there were no more female co-stars or team members on the show to distract anybody along with the fact that Tawnia and Amy rarely got involved in any of the heavy-duty work and action on this show, since Amy & Tawnia had the easy job on the team and this show.Therefore, Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock all acted as if Amy never even existed and never mentioned Amy with the exception of ""The Battle Of Bel Air"" episode when Amy's name was brought up numerous times when Tawnia volunteered to take Amy's place and explains to the team how Amy Allen was a former co-worker of hers from the L.A. Courier and how she knew of the A-Team so well when Hannibal explains to Tawnia indicating that Amy left the team to take a job in Jakarta rather than saying that Culea was fired from the show or that Amy was ousted from the team, but this show pretty much started going downhill after this season along with the fact that I noticed a slump in the ratings when THE A-TEAM hit its Third Season and then the ratings sagged even more when it hit its Fourth Season in the Fall of 1985 nearly leading to its cancellation in the Spring of 1986.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Markie Post in ""The Only Church In Town"" episode during her co-starring days as Colt Seavers agent(Terri Michaels) on THE FALL GUY days and before her co-starring days on NIGHT COURT*Bo Hopkins in the ""Pure Dee Poison"" episode after his co-starring days on DYNASTY*Morgan Woodward in the ""When You Comin Back Range Rider"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS*Bill Boyett in the ""Steel"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt.

Harry Santos days on THE NEW ADAM-12This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when NBC's motto was ""You can NBC there: ""BE THERE"", since that was NBC's slogan from September of 1983 thru June of 1984.In fact, it also brings back childhood memories to me when I used to watch THE A-TEAM every Tuesday night on NBC, since it was part of NBC's Tuesday night line-up, which started with THE A-TEAM at 8PM followed by RIPTIDE at 9PM and then topped off by REMINGTON STEELE at 10PM.",4,The last season with Amy Allen,1201132800,"01 24, 2008",2008,12907,"['1983-84', 'Season', 'DVD', 'THE',

882561,A1E8RC0BLALMUN,B0007LXP7W,T. Smith,"[1, 2]","This episode was not a highlight of the second season. It was the A team meets themselves the B team and then wins the fistfight. Role credits. It was one would guess about time someone would gang up on main heroes. A mercenary is hired. Hired a million dollars per A Team member to remove them. Someone is getting milked when we get to see how bad a merceneary the hired guy is. The main gun is Ed Lauter,  from a season one show. He is not a believable killer in any way. However, Melinda Culea's replacement Marla Heasley shows her believability in acting by doing a fine job of milking here part that has her taking pictures of some cows. Wonder why they let her go her at the end of the season. Just plain weaker than usual plod (no typo) that opens with Team supposedly in training. This was actually funny. They get picked off one by one by mercernearies which carries the suspense of a milk commerical. Hannibal is tougher and survives the spedative spiked milk, gets back on his horse with medical help to chew up the villains in an exciting fist fight finale. Pretty forgettable. The main characters all seemed somewhat muted. The one highlight was a gorgeous Tricia O'neil making another appearance as Doc Sullivan although they call her Maggie instead of Mo from the season 1 show.  To bad she was in this so little. Too bad the writers  could not have featured her as a more recurrung guest.  Her backstory was vietnam medic and she would have fit in. (But then there was Peppards oft spoken penchant for feeling women had no major place in this kind of show).  Both Lauter and O'neill were in the the Black Rock epsisode. At least there,  Ed Lauter was believable and O'neill who is always great had not much more than seven or eight short lines.On a trivia note, Barbara Stock from Spenser for Hire, Dallas, pops in as a seductive vixen.)  Not one of this series stellar efforts.",3,Deadly maneuvers,1183766400,"07 7, 2007",2007,1894,"['episode', 'was', 'not', 'highlight', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'A', 'team', 'B', 'team', 'then', 'fistfight', 'Role', 'credits', 'was', 'one', 'would', 'guess', 'time', 'someone', 'would', 'gang', 'up', 'main', 'heroes', 'mercenary', 'hired', 'Hired', 'million', 'dollars', 'Team', 'member', 'remove', 'Someone', 'getting', 'milked', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'bad', 'merceneary', 'hired', 'guy', 'main', 'gun', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'not', 'believable', 'killer', 'way', 'However', 'Melinda', 'Culea', 'replacement', 'Marla', 'Heasley', 'believability', 'acting', 'doing', 'fine', 'job', 'milking', 'here', 'part', 'taking', 'pictures', 'cows', 'Wonder', 'why', 'let', 'go', 'end', 'season', 'Just', 'plain', 'weaker', 'usual', 'plod', 'typo', 'Team', 'supposedly', 'training', 'was', 'actually', 'funny', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'mercernearies', 'suspense', 'milk', 'commerical', 'Hannibal', 'tougher', 'spedative', 'spiked', 'milk', 'back', 'horse', 'medical', 'help', 'chew', 'up', 'villains', 'exciting', 'fist', 'fight', 'finale', 'Pretty', 'forgettable', 'main', 'characters', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'muted', 'one', 'highlight', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'Tricia', ""O'neil"", 'making', 'appearance', 'Doc', 'Sullivan', 'call', 'Maggie', 'instead', 'Mo', 'season', '1', 'show', 'bad', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'Too', 'bad', 'writers', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'featured', 'more', 'recurrung', 'guest', 'backstory', 'was', 'vietnam', 'medic', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'then', 'was', 'Peppards', 'oft', 'spoken', 'penchant', 'feeling', 'women', 'had', 'major', 'place', 'kind', 'show', 'Lauter', ""O'neill"", 'were', 'Black', 'Rock', 'epsisode', 'least', 'there', 'Ed', 'Lauter', 'was', 'believable', ""O'neill"", 'who', 'always', 'great', 'had', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'seven', 'eight', 'short', 'lines.On', 'trivia', 'note', 'Barbara', 'Stock', 'Spenser', 'Hire', 'Dallas', 'seductive', 'vixen', 'Not', 'one', 'series', 'stellar', 'efforts']",The A-Team: Season Two
