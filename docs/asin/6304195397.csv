I've also read that it was one of the most important black films of all time.  Hey, it came out long before I was born, so I had no idea what these people were talking about.  I had to see it for myself.While all three points are neglibile, this movie is horrible.There's hardly any dialouge, the main character lacks any kind of depth.  In fact, the main character says only a few words in the entire film.  The movie consists of him running ""from the man,"" overpowering ""the man,"" and f****** himself out of every situation.  The only thing he's got going for him is having some ""sweetback.""  As a man, I found the notion that he can f*** his way out of his problems disgusting and unrealistic.  I'm not saying this as some kind of moralist.  I love reading and writing noir fiction.  I love cheesy movies and even cheesier noir, but I hate this movie.  If that wasn't enough, the psychadelic cinematography was blurry, grainy and shaky.  In fact, 2/3 rds of the movie consists of unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.The only thing I can agree with is that this film was the most important indie film of all time.  Not black, because its bigger than being a black film.  My reason?  Because without Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song making money, none of the much better indie films get made over the past 40+ years, regardless of genre.Anyone who knows me knows that in order for me to assign anything one-star, its got to be very, very, very, very bad.",1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Watched,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,1636,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'many', 'occasions', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadassss', 'Song', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'groundbreaking', 'revolutionary', 'films', 'blaxploitation', 'era', ""'ve"", 'also', 'read', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'black', 'films', 'time', 'Hey', 'came', 'out', 'long', 'was', 'born', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'talking', 'had', 'see', 'myself.While', 'three', 'points', 'are', 'neglibile', 'movie', 'hardly', 'dialouge', 'main', 'character', 'kind', 'depth', 'fact', 'main', 'character', 'only', 'few', 'words', 'entire', 'film', 'movie', 'running', 'man', 'overpowering', 'man', 'f******', 'situation', 'only', 'thing', 'got', 'going', 'having', 'sweetback', 'man', 'found', 'notion', 'can', 'f***', 'way', 'problems', 'disgusting', 'unrealistic', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'kind', 'moralist', 'love', 'reading', 'writing', 'noir', 'fiction', 'love', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'even', 'cheesier', 'noir', 'hate', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'psychadelic', 'cinematography', 'was', 'blurry', 'grainy', 'shaky', 'fact', '2/3', 'rds', 'movie', 'unnecessary', 'scenes', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie.The', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'agree', 'film', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'indie', 'film', 'time', 'Not', 'black', 'bigger', 'being', 'black', 'film', 'reason', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadassss', 'Song', 'making', 'money', 'none', 'much', 'better', 'indie', 'films', 'get', 'made', 'past', '40+', 'years', 'regardless', 'genre.Anyone', 'who', 'order', 'assign', 'anything', 'one-star', 'got', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'bad']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS

But this has to be one of the worse films that I have ever seen. I couldn't  figure out what was the point of the film until half way through: absolutely nothing. My finger was permanently on the  fast forward button because most of  the scenes were pointless or were too disgusting to watch.  You don't know how appalled  I was when the beginning opened up with an 11 year old being raped. I wondered why someone would let their child participate in such an act just to be in a movie. There is no real acting and the characters are all one-dimensional and shallow. Sweetback rarely utters a word. All he does is run, screw, and kill. No shame at all. He runs through the city, through the woods,  and through the desert,  wearing the same funky smelling outfit. How he managed to convince someone to switch clothes with him for $5, I don't know. On the other hand his afro remained perfectly even and his sideburns and beard were always neatly trimmed. The cinematography was so awful that it made me dizzy. The music was wack and it was played constantly. The nudity and the sex scenes were more than enough and unnecessary.

406560,A3JM7ZRLXC18UC,6304195397,Church of The Flaming Sword,"[22, 59]","I have to give Melvin Van Peebles credit for one thing.  He  managed to achieve something that the creators of megahits like _Star Wars_, _Spiderman_, _E.T._, _Jaws_, and _Raiders of the Lost Ark_ could not accomplish.  He filmed _Sweet Sweetback's Baaaada*** Song_ with right around $50,000 and wound up grossing over $10 million.  That's 20,000% profit.  Pretty impressive.  However, many things that create a huge profit within the entertainment industry aren't necessarily that great.  Look at reality shows, gangsta rap, and Americanized J-horror for further proof.  Yet _Sweet Sweetback_ isn't just bad, it's downright repugnant.  These are several reasons why I think - I take that back, why I know it does not deserve it's lofty reputation.1.  The opening scene - As some of you know, our ""hero"" Sweetback (you wouldn't believe how loosely I'm using that term) was raised in a brothel.  Within the first 10 minutes, you see Melvin's son Mario engaged in sexual congress with an older lady.  Mario was 13 years old at the time.  Using a child for such a scene is beyond disgusting, but your own child is - well , I can't think of a word for it.2.  The police beating scene - I in no way condone police brutality of any sort.  Any police officer(s) who brutalize anyone in the way that the young black man is in the film deserve(s) to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Then again, there is also the way in which Sweetback takes out his anger on the abusive cops.  He doesn't seem to be worried about the welfare of the victim so much as he wants to beat the cops to a bloody pulp.  By doing this, he becomes as immoral as The Man whom he claims is victimizing him.3.  It's racist - The target isn't really The Man per se, it's The White Man.  Peebles is one of those misguided souls who believe that the answer to racism is to attack every member of the other race, regardless of guilt or innocence.  White men are either portrayed as burly hippy bikers or abusive,racist cops.  And white women are shown as mindless cretins who swoon at the promise of sexual delight from a black man.4.  The editing - _Sweet Sweetback_ has 15 minutes worth of story stretched in at least 90 minutes of pure nothingness.  95% of the movie is cops brutalizing black people, Sweetback running, Sweetback having sex, or Sweetback running while having sex - just joking about that last one.  But seriously, go watch a kindergarten play, or just about anything else except _The Real Cancun_, if you want see something better produced.And finally...5. The tagline - ""Rated X by an ALL White jury"".  Peebles can sure talk some crap.  Doesn't he realize that ""white-bread"" films like _A Clockwork Orange_ and _Midnight Cowboy_ were also given the kiss-of-death X rating?  But unlike _Sweetback_, those films were full of artistic merit.  It think the primary reason for it's X rating was to save filmgoers from this cinematic weapon of brain cell destruction.Avoid as if your life depended on it.

B-move trash or a brilliantly inspired art movie...  - - The truth is, the strength and weakness of SWEETBACK is that its really  all of this, but if you're expecting it to meet the mold of any one of these genre's you'll be disappointed... and that's part of the fun of the film... getting past the shock to see the message, and the message to dig the shock... and just riding along with Sweetback (EWF's soundtrack definitely makes that part easy !)  With its gritty, funky tale and soundtrack, ample booty, controversial story no doubt that there's something in it to both appease and offend just about anyone that watches it... so the best thing to do is put it like this :  SWEETBACK is a genre all of its own...  just sit and watch it in suspended judgement and disbelief... watch it, again and again and again...  Depending upon who you are you'll either find it tasty and addictive... or... well, revolting and disgusting... whatever... the fact is when you watch it there's one thing you won't come away seeing, ""Man this film reminds me of a film I've seen 100 times before...""

A black stud gets taken downtown, but they pick up a black activist along the way.  Sweetback beats the crap out of the cops, then runs to Mexico.  This film is remarkable in that it has a feel of a French New Wave film.  Van Peebles had lived in Paris in the 1960's, and the influence of that country's films rubbed off of him here (which is a good thing).  With jump cuts, double exposures, and various other visual tricks, Van Peebles made the most artistic blaxploitation film ever made.  The fact that it doesn't seem concerned with plot either (many European films don't have as much plotting as American ones do) gives it an even more European feel to it.  But the situation is strictly American.  I love the soundtrack too.  Van Peebles wrote the music, but it's performed by Earth, Wind, and Fire.  I do feel that the slogan ""rated X by an all white jury"" is a bit silly.  As another reviewer pointed out, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, and Scheslinger's Midnight Cowboy all got tagged with an X rating around this time, so it was a tad ridiculous.  No doubt the tag line helped sell a lot more tickets.  I admit I smiled when I saw that on the cover of the film, but then realised that it's really just a gimmick.

406569,A2BC978GQQEA2A,6304195397,Jeffrey Pidgeon,"[6, 11]","Made for a pittance, initially released in just two theaters, ultimately grossing over ten million dollars, ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" became the progenitor of the ""Blaxploitation"" film craze of the seventies. Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt.The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment.En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter.Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, ""Sweetback"" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome.Thirty years after its explosive release, ""Sweetback"" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well.PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes.PPS - I just saw ""Badasssss!"" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was made) last night (10/25). It makes for a great double feature, as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was.",2,You Had To Be There,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",2006,2540,"['Made', 'pittance', 'initially', 'released', 'just', 'two', 'theaters', 'ultimately', 'grossing', 'over', 'ten', 'million', 'dollars', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadasssss', 'Song', 'became', 'progenitor', 'Blaxploitation', 'film', 'craze', 'seventies', 'Considered', 'seminal', 'film', 'African-American', 'cinema', 'Director', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'influenced', 'independent', 'film', 'movement', 'whole', 'jazzy', 'editing', 'strong', 'hero', 'set', 'miles', 'apart', 'standard', 'fare', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'African-American', 'audiences', 'could', 'see', 'film', 'long-overdue', 'cinematic', 'thunderbolt.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Sweetback', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'grown', 'up', 'bordello', 'become', 'one', 'central', 'attractions', 'One', 'night', 'accompany', 'pair', 'police', 'officers', 'downtown', 'questioning', 'murder', 'case', 'suspects', 'gesture', 'be', 'compensation', 'force', 'lenience', 'establishment.En', 'route', 'interrogation', 'however', 'police', 'intercept', 'youth', 'street', 'brutally', 'beat', 'Using', 'handcuffs', 'Sweetback', 'officers', 'rest', 'protracted', 'chase', 'Sweetback', 'using', 'fists', 'other', 'body', 'parts', 'make', 'way', 'border', 'police', 'question', 'companions', 'hot', 'trail', 'guns', 'bloodhounds', 'one', 'point', 'helicopter.Van', 'Peebles', 'eye', 'striking', 'shot', 'vivid', 'scenes', 'police', 'officers', 'brutalizing', 'Sweetback', 'friend', 'Beetle', 'get', 'point', 'historic', 'contribution', 'clear', 'Sweetback', 'little', 'offer', 'modern', 'audiences', 'kitsch', 'value', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'strong', 'presence', 'laconic', 'hero', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'narrative', 'memorable', 'characters', 'savor', 'plenty', 'sex', 'violence', 'be', 'had', 'X', 'rating', 'fully', 'earned', 'episodic', 'much', 'film', 'be', 'enormous', 'montage', 'repeated', 'street', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'clips', 'effect', 'rapidly', 'tiresome.Thirty', 'years', 'explosive', 'release', 'Sweetback', 'will', 'remain', 'compelling', 'film', 'historians', 'students', 'torch', 'been', 'passed', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'pioneering', 'effort', 'not', 'dated', 'well.PS', 'DVD', 'release', 'interview', 'director', 'Initially', 'shares', 'formal', 'similarities', 'feature', 'later', 'interesting', 'amusing', 'just', 'saw', 'Badasssss', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'docudrama', 'how', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadasssss', 'Song', 'was', 'made', 'last', 'night', '10/25', 'great', 'double', 'feature', 'really', 'understand', 'how', 'difficult', 'production', 'was']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS
406570,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6304195397,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[6, 9]","This movie might be unreal for some but blaxploitation was born due to the help of  ""the Black Community"" who were all tired of the ""Man"" holding them down.I sat down to watch ""Sweet Sweetback"" for the first time last night and was almost lost for a moment. The opening sequence, bordering on child pornography, would never slip by the protestors of today. Yet, in 1971, this movie made its debut in (according to the box) two theatres and endured a torrent of negative reviews before going on to gross $10,000,000. Go figure.The movie breaks down like this -- Sweet Sweetback is a lover-extraordinaire (he nails just about every female in the film) that rises up against two white cops and beats them down while they are picking on a local militant leader. From here we watch Sweetback run... and run... and run... and run... and run... and run... and run, trying to make his way to Mexico before he gets caught. Along the way, Sweetback encounters various people that matter little to the story but are just there for the hell of it, it seems. Dialogue is sparse throughout most of the film -- how much time is there to talk when you're setting the world's record for the most profitable cross-country video on the market? -- making the story hard to follow unless you've merely dismissed it as a dude running from the long-arm of the law.I rate this film 5 stars without even a second thought on the matter. ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" although giving birth to the blaxploitation genre, has to be one of the most horrible films to endure by any one person. This movie is politically motivated, but is not political. The oppressive whites in the film are caricatures (and most, incidentally, are in the police); they torture Sweetback's allies for clues, threaten with guns, and are racially motivated. Sweetback's incriminating action -- murder -- is justified in this haughty racial context. Finally, it is style, glamour, and even virtuosic direction (in the inclusive use of so many familiar techniques) that paves Sweetback's value as a timepiece -- its lasting, testimonial contribution is its position as the first of its kind.",5,And so it begins.....,1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,2145,"['movie', 'might', 'be', 'unreal', 'blaxploitation', 'was', 'born', 'due', 'help', 'Black', 'Community', 'who', 'were', 'tired', 'Man', 'holding', 'down.I', 'sat', 'watch', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'almost', 'lost', 'moment', 'opening', 'sequence', 'bordering', 'child', 'pornography', 'would', 'never', 'slip', 'protestors', 'today', '1971', 'movie', 'made', 'debut', 'according', 'box', 'two', 'theatres', 'endured', 'torrent', 'negative', 'reviews', 'going', 'gross', '10,000,000', 'Go', 'figure.The', 'movie', 'breaks', 'down', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'lover-extraordinaire', 'just', 'about', 'female', 'film', 'up', 'two', 'white', 'cops', 'beats', 'down', 'are', 'picking', 'local', 'militant', 'leader', 'here', 'watch', 'Sweetback', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'run', 'trying', 'make', 'way', 'Mexico', 'caught', 'way', 'Sweetback', 'various', 'people', 'matter', 'little', 'story', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'hell', 'Dialogue', 'sparse', 'most', 'film', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'there', 'talk', 'when', ""'re"", 'setting', 'world', 'record', 'most', 'profitable', 'cross-country', 'video', 'market', 'making', 'story', 'hard', 'follow', ""'ve"", 'merely', 'dismissed', 'dude', 'running', 'long-arm', 'law.I', 'rate', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'second', 'thought', 'matter', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baadasssss', 'Song', 'giving', 'birth', 'blaxploitation', 'genre', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'horrible', 'films', 'endure', 'one', 'person', 'movie', 'politically', 'motivated', 'not', 'political', 'oppressive', 'whites', 'film', 'are', 'caricatures', 'most', 'incidentally', 'are', 'police', 'torture', 'Sweetback', 'allies', 'clues', 'threaten', 'guns', 'are', 'racially', 'motivated', 'Sweetback', 'incriminating', 'action', 'murder', 'justified', 'haughty', 'racial', 'context', 'Finally', 'style', 'glamour', 'even', 'virtuosic', 'direction', 'inclusive', 'use', 'so', 'many', 'familiar', 'techniques', 'Sweetback', 'value', 'timepiece', 'lasting', 'testimonial', 'contribution', 'position', 'first', 'kind']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS

You'll find yourself spending most of your time trying to figure out just what in the hell this movie is about. This may have been one of the first ""Black Power"" movies from the 70's and it's also the worst.Sweetback pretty much runs through the entire movie, and when he is not running, he is having sex. It only breaks from that cycle to show him beating up a cop or few. The weird thing about this film is that the ""Sex"" has nothing to do with anything! It's mostly just out of context the entire film. This movie really has no plot. It's actually just Melvin Van Peebles running from the city to the desert.Watching this movie is like getting high. It's confusing, it makes no sense, and it's just strange as hell. ""You bled my mamma, You bled my pappa, but you won't bleed me"" get used to that phrase, because that's all you'll ever hear in the back tracking music this entire film. Interestingly enough Earthwind and Fire provided the music for this film, this being one of their earliest gigs. That's probably the only signifigant thing in this film worth taking note of.I can't even think of a single solitary reason why this is worth watching today. It cetainly is not worth owning. I'm suprised this even made it from VHS to DVD. I mean I don't mind the badly recorded audio or visuals of this film, I expect that. There's plenty of low budget films that look horrible; however, a good low budget film makes up for that with an outstanding storyline. This waste of footage has neither.I don't care if this is supposed to be a great ""Black"" accomplishment, this is trash! This is more of a great ""Black"" embarassment. If your looking for a 70's Black Power flick with a message I highly recommend ""Watermelon Man.""

True, there were other black films before this one, but never one like it, and really, there never would be again.Melvin van plays Sweetback, a professional stud who works live sex shows, who is picked up by the cops to help them look as though they are working on a murder case. But when, the cops stop to rough up a revolutionary, Sweetback suddenly develops revolutionary ideas of his own and beats up the cops with his own handcuffs and goes on the run. That's essentially it, and what may seem boring, dated, disgusting and/or silly to most people, was some radical stuff back in 71. [...] It's radical enough now, you ain't ever seen a film like this! During his travels, Sweetback encounters all kinds of opposition (cops, biker gangs, posses etc), sees all kinds of places in the ghetto (baptist churches, rat-infested tenements, and finally the dessert)and is subjected to all kinds of experimental film making (colour tints, subjective shots, weird angles, freeze-frames etc.)What makes this film so different and exciting for me, is that having obviously been made with private money and many, many miles away froma  studio, it can and does push the politics and revolutionary rhetoric right in your face and believe me it does! It is little wonder that Huey Newton (supposedly) made this required viewing for the Black Panther Party and that within a short time films like Shaft, Superfly and their clones were filling the cinemas on 42nd Street. Unlike the legions of films that followed this, which became more and more watered down copies of the central idea of this film (that a black man can take on his oppressors and actually win), this film is the REAL DEAL and power to van Peebles for having the guts and wherewithall to get his vision splashed across the screens.",4,On the run from an all-white jury...,992304000,"06 12, 2001",2001,2032,"['1971', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'managed', 'get', 'little', 'gem', 'released', 'Cinemation', 'Industries', 'low-budget', 'exploitation', 'distributor', 'launched', 'theatres', 'consequently', 'launching', 'what', 'would', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'Blaxpoitation', 'same', 'time', 'True', 'were', 'other', 'black', 'films', 'one', 'never', 'one', 'really', 'never', 'would', 'be', 'again.Melvin', 'van', 'Sweetback', 'professional', 'stud', 'who', 'live', 'sex', 'shows', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'cops', 'help', 'look', 'are', 'working', 'murder', 'case', 'when', 'cops', 'stop', 'rough', 'up', 'revolutionary', 'Sweetback', 'suddenly', 'revolutionary', 'ideas', 'own', 'up', 'cops', 'own', 'handcuffs', 'run', 'essentially', 'what', 'may', 'seem', 'boring', 'dated', 'disgusting', 'and/or', 'silly', 'most', 'people', 'was', 'radical', 'stuff', 'back', '71', '[', 'radical', 'enough', 'now', 'ai', ""n't"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'travels', 'Sweetback', 'kinds', 'opposition', 'cops', 'biker', 'gangs', 'posses', 'etc', 'kinds', 'places', 'ghetto', 'baptist', 'churches', 'rat-infested', 'tenements', 'finally', 'dessert', 'subjected', 'kinds', 'experimental', 'film', 'making', 'colour', 'tints', 'subjective', 'shots', 'weird', 'angles', 'freeze-frames', 'etc', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'different', 'exciting', 'having', 'obviously', 'been', 'made', 'private', 'money', 'many', 'many', 'miles', 'away', 'froma', 'studio', 'can', 'push', 'politics', 'revolutionary', 'rhetoric', 'right', 'face', 'believe', 'little', 'wonder', 'Huey', 'Newton', 'supposedly', 'made', 'required', 'viewing', 'Black', 'Panther', 'Party', 'short', 'time', 'films', 'Shaft', 'Superfly', 'clones', 'were', 'filling', 'cinemas', '42nd', 'Street', 'legions', 'films', 'followed', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'watered', 'copies', 'central', 'idea', 'film', 'black', 'man', 'can', 'take', 'oppressors', 'actually', 'win', 'film', 'REAL', 'DEAL', 'power', 'van', 'Peebles', 'having', 'guts', 'wherewithall', 'get', 'vision', 'splashed', 'screens']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS

I found a book about the film in the late 70's but, growing up in Ohio (a very white part of Ohio before videos and DVDs), there was no chance that I would ever see it then.Now, with cable and DVDs, I could finally see it.  Like other ""breakthrough"" films though, it didn't live up to the hype.  I think it should be appreciated for what it was and not what it is.I'm looking forward to seeing Melvin's son Mario's film, BADASS, because everything I've read and seen about SWEETBACK is more interesting than SWEETBACK itself.SWEETBACK is very cheaply made.  The night scenes are nearly impossible to see.  Melvin, when he isn't running, looks like he's posing.  The sex scenes get to be self-serving after a while (would white bikers of that era really cheer on a black man sexin' one of their women?).  Production-wise and, honestly, story-wise, SWEETBACK is closer to the Dolemite films by Rudy Ray Moore than SUPERFLY (which I thought was a great movie).But SWEETBACK is also bold and passionate and, if it did start the independent Black film movement of the 1970's, worthy of study.",3,"More for What It Was, Not What it Is",1092268800,"08 12, 2004",2004,1239,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'catch', 'up', 'lot', 'Blaxploitation', 'films', '1970', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'SWEET', 'SWEETBACK', 'BADASSS', 'SONG', 'found', 'book', 'film', 'late', '70', 'growing', 'up', 'Ohio', 'very', 'white', 'part', 'Ohio', 'videos', 'DVDs', 'was', 'chance', 'would', 'ever', 'see', 'then.Now', 'cable', 'DVDs', 'could', 'finally', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'hype', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'appreciated', 'what', 'was', 'not', 'what', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Melvin', 'son', 'Mario', 'film', 'BADASS', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'read', 'seen', 'SWEETBACK', 'more', 'interesting', 'SWEETBACK', 'itself.SWEETBACK', 'very', 'cheaply', 'made', 'night', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'see', 'Melvin', 'when', ""n't"", 'running', 'posing', 'sex', 'scenes', 'get', 'be', 'self-serving', 'while', 'would', 'white', 'bikers', 'era', 'really', 'cheer', 'black', 'man', 'sexin', 'one', 'women', 'Production-wise', 'honestly', 'story-wise', 'SWEETBACK', 'closer', 'Dolemite', 'films', 'Rudy', 'Ray', 'Moore', 'SUPERFLY', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', '.But', 'SWEETBACK', 'also', 'bold', 'passionate', 'did', 'start', 'independent', 'Black', 'film', 'movement', '1970', 'worthy', 'study']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS
406585,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,6304195397,Tristan,"[0, 0]","The legendary film, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, was the first film specifically made for the black community,  by the black community, in order to not only give the black community a hero in the cinemas but also to replicate the black experience. It became the first blaxsploitation picture as well as one of the highest grossing independent films of the 1970s. Melvin Van Peebles not only self-financed the film, but also starred in it, wrote the screenplay, and directed it. He also allowed his children to play in it, as well as many of his closest friends. It is one of the most groundbreaking films of all time. It not only helped change the shape of black cinema, but also independent filmmaking at large. It tells the troubled story of a male prostitute named Sweet Sweetback who, after witnessing police brutality against a fellow black man, beats up a police officer. Now on the run from the law, Sweetback must do what he can to avoid and evade the police, even if that means involvement from the Hell's Angels and using his ""talent"".The big question is, how does the film hold up today? In my opinion, it's still an effective and powerful film in a lot of ways. However, there are some serious problems that many people will either be too distracted or too seasoned to overlook. It's frightfully shot. You can certainly tell that the filmmakers had to use cheap camera equipment because the film looks completely awful. It's one of the ugliest films I have ever seen, and a good portion of the time it's kinda hard to tell what's going on. At a lot of intervals in the film you can see gunk and sludge on the camera lens, and that can most certainly get in the way of the imagery I can imagine. However, personally I think this works to the film's advantage in a lot of ways. It helps add an element of authenticity to the subject matter. This is guerrilla filmmaking at it's best, so I can overlook the camera problems and technical difficulties. This film takes place in a landscape full of junkies, pimps, prostitutes, and other assorted street urchins. A lot of films have a purposefully grungy look and feel to them that gives many films a sense of style. The problem that many people may have here is that in this film it is not used for stylistic purposes. This is where these people lived. This was their world for this particular group of characters. It's rough, it's unpleasant, it's bizarre and it's somewhat nostalgic too. I like how the film gradually shows us more of Sweetback's world than it does of himself. I like that the film is shot in industrial landscapes and grimy alleyways. I think these kinds of settings work really well for a film with this kind of energy. What I appreciate most about this film is that it belongs in a class of it's own. It's definitely not exploitation, nor is it really trying to tell a story. There isn't any character development. There are no revelations or plot twists or surprises, save for the big big one at the very end of the film. There certainly isn't any likable characters, nor are there any characters that you feel you should hate. This film is just good guys, meaning the black community, and the bad guys, meaning white police officers. This film creates it's own landscape. Sure, the landscape may be full of crooked cops and repulsive sex, but it's a landscape that is new and that is fresh and full of energy and life and power and unique imagery.The film also features a funky soundtrack by Earth, Wind and Fire that really helps push the film into the realm of cult cinema and also gives the film a little more of a sense of ferociousness that you can't help but feel. There's also tremendous style in the editing that you just do not see in films today. In the 70s, there were plenty of films that had the same sort of psychedelic camerawork and visual effects, but none were used like they were here. Instead of being used to add emotion or humor to a scene, here it is used in a way that I found nightmarish, haunting, and incredibly horrific. The film has a lot of radical imagery, and most of that comes when Sweetback is actually running from the man. A lot of it transcends the narrative confines of the film and actually makes a transverse turn into an alternate documentary reality that I found incredibly profound, honest, and admirable. Van Peebles obviously had a lot of ambitions for this film, and it shows. In many ways, this is a documentary. Eventually, the film even breaks the forth wall. I'm not going to spoil any surprises, but I will say that somehow this film gets it right.When we first see Sweet Sweetback, he is only a little boy, played by Mario Van Peebles (Melvin's son), who appears hungry, dirty, tired, and starved. Soon after we, don't so much as see as much as we, witness a woman taking him into a room and having sex with him. The next time we see him, he is a man and he looks like a black cowboy, heroic and angry. When we see his eyes, however, he looks devoid of humanity, life, emotion, and the slightest hint of happiness. He is not a typical hero by any means. He's an underdog. He's a victim who fights back. He's a damaged man who is using all that remains to fight against what has destroyed his life and the lives of all of his brothers and sisters. I think that when it comes to a lot of films, we only get specific kinds of heroes. We get heroes who we could picture having in real life. To me, Sweet Sweetback is an outcast who has spent his entire life in the lowest parts of the low, and he's tired of it. I'm sure many people have felt like outcasts at one time or another, but not like Sweetback has. I think, despite what you may think of Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, that this says more about independent film and black cinema than most films would have the balls to say. Even though it may not be a good film, it put a smile on my face and made me want to cheer, and that's something that I can't say about most films of this type.",3,Very important piece of

406587,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,6304195397,Tsuyoshi,"[12, 13]","Without the historical context in the early 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' makes no sense at all. But if you have some knowledge about so-called blaxploitaion films, minor film genre made mainly for Afro-American audiences in the 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is still a very bizarre experience to you. And I am a Japanese, fan of Pam Grier films, but I believe the film about `Sweet Sweetback' looks strange wherever you live.The content or message of `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' can be summarized in the following words you will see at the beginning of the film: ""This film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough of the Man."" Most probably before this film no film had ever tried to show a black character hitting and knocking out a white (and a white cop for that matter), and for better or worse, the way the film does it is amazingly raw and crude.The Man is represented by several non-descriptive white cops who beat up a black. When star and director Melvin Van Peebles says he had enough, he (or his character) shows it by bludgeoning the cops senseless. The police (largely whites) are not competent enough to chase Sweetback, and he gets away very easily from them. By the conventional standard of narrative, the film is almost pointless, going on and on without showing where it is leading us. Occasionally we see Sweetback helped by some and betrayed by others (including blacks), or the strange episodes of Sweetback drinking the water in the mud.It might look strange today that the film actually became a big hit in 1971, but it did. What distinguishes `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' from the films like `Shaft' and `Coffy' both commercial success, is the crudeness of its message and the techniques. As to the message there is nothing that I can add here, I tried to find the sub-texts in the scenes of Melvin Van Peebles running endlessly in the street of LA, or lots of nude bodies in the film, but could find nothing in them.You know what you should expect from the low-budget film with less-than-enough lighting equipment. That happened in the films like `Superfly.' But `Superfly' doesn't have so many double exposures, out-of-focus images, and other tricks that could be seen only in the psychedelic era. At the same time, the film is also notable for clever use of the jazzy and funky soundtrack by Earth Wind and Fire, setting the trend of the blaxploitaion films and their music.But all these things do not prove that the film is still good as entertainment nor justify the abundant nudities and sex scenes. The opening section showing young Sweetback (played by Melvin's real-life son Mario) is still unnecessarily graphic and even shocking to some today.Perhaps as Mario Van Peebles did in his `Baadassss!' a filmic account of the making, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is most interesting if seen with social and personal history behind itself. Otherwise, the messy film is hard to enjoy as it is today.",2,"Historically Important, But Awfully Raw and Crude",1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,2996,"['historical', 'context', 'early', '70s', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baad', 'Asssss', 'Song', 'sense', 'have', 'knowledge', 'so-called', 'blaxploitaion', 'films', 'minor', 'film', 'genre', 'made', 'mainly', 'Afro-American', 'audiences', '70s', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baad', 'Asssss', 'Song', 'still', 'very', 'bizarre', 'experience', 'am', 'Japanese', 'fan', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'films', 'believe', 'film', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'looks', 'strange', 'live.The', 'content', 'message', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baad', 'Asssss', 'Song', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'following', 'words', 'will', 'see', 'beginning', 'film', 'film', 'dedicated', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'who', 'had', 'enough', 'Man', 'Most', 'probably', 'film', 'film', 'had', 'ever', 'tried', 'show', 'black', 'character', 'hitting', 'knocking', 'out', 'white', 'white', 'cop', 'matter', 'better', 'worse', 'way', 'film', 'amazingly', 'raw', 'crude.The', 'Man', 'represented', 'several', 'non-descriptive', 'white', 'cops', 'who', 'beat', 'up', 'black', 'When', 'star', 'director', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'had', 'enough', 'character', 'bludgeoning', 'cops', 'senseless', 'police', 'largely', 'are', 'not', 'competent', 'enough', 'chase', 'Sweetback', 'away', 'very', 'easily', 'conventional', 'standard', 'narrative', 'film', 'almost', 'pointless', 'going', 'showing', 'where', 'leading', 'Occasionally', 'see', 'Sweetback', 'helped', 'betrayed', 'others', 'including', 'blacks', 'strange', 'episodes', 'Sweetback', 'drinking', 'water', 'mud.It', 'might', 'look', 'strange', 'today', 'film', 'actually', 'became', 'big', 'hit', '1971', 'did', 'What', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baad', 'Asssss', 'Song', 'films', 'Shaft', 'Coffy', 'commercial', 'success', 'crudeness', 'message', 'techniques', 'message', 'nothing', 'can', 'add', 'here', 'tried', 'find', 'sub-texts', 'scenes', 'Melvin', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'running', 'endlessly', 'street', 'LA', 'lots', 'nude', 'bodies', 'film', 'could', 'find', 'nothing', 'them.You', 'know', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'low-budget', 'film', 'less-than-enough', 'lighting', 'equipment', 'happened', 'films', 'Superfly', 'Superfly', ""n't"", 'have', 'so', 'many', 'double', 'exposures', 'out-of-focus', 'images', 'other', 'tricks', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'only', 'psychedelic', 'era', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'also', 'notable', 'clever', 'use', 'jazzy', 'funky', 'soundtrack', 'Earth', 'Wind', 'Fire', 'setting', 'trend', 'blaxploitaion', 'films', 'music.But', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'prove', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'entertainment', 'justify', 'abundant', 'nudities', 'sex', 'scenes', 'opening', 'section', 'showing', 'young', 'Sweetback', 'played', 'Melvin', 'real-life', 'son', 'Mario', 'still', 'unnecessarily', 'graphic', 'even', 'shocking', 'today.Perhaps', 'Mario', 'Van', 'Peebles', 'did', 'Baadassss', 'filmic', 'account', 'making', 'Sweet', 'Sweetback', 'Baad', 'Asssss', 'Song', 'most', 'interesting', 'seen', 'social', 'personal', 'history', 'Otherwise', 'messy', 'film', 'hard', 'enjoy', 'today']",Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song VHS
