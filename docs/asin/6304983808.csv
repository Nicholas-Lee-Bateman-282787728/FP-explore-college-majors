442978,AYRPJESM22ERK,6304983808,Allan MacInnis,"[53, 56]","Alright, so the acting is often amateurish and it isn't approved by Wiccans and the lot. They can go play with their chalices and swords -- it's a brilliant little movie. Romero looks at sexual frustration, the sexual revolution (California-style), and the relationship of these things to what would become known as &quot;New Age spirituality&quot; with a critical, curious, searching eye, making his most reflective and unusual film. Donovan's song is nicely used, and there are some almost Cassavetes-like moments where the characters push each other into revealing deep-seated frustrations and fears... Also some interesting considerations of the relationship between religious beliefs and sexual needs which, really, just aren't TREATED that often in cinema. The film seems to seriously want to explore everything that Romero thinks might be healthy about witchcraft, without being afraid to also criticize it, as well. I'd almost be willing to call it a feminist film, in that Romero earnestly tries to frame 70's west-coasty let's-pretend/ let's-get-nekkid occultism in the context of VERY REAL female struggles at the time. His cynicism ultimately wins out, however; though the movie remains ultimately a little ambiguous, the last scene seems pretty mocking, to my eyes... In any event -- it is worth watching and thinking about. And yes, Satanism and Wicca are different things, and YES, Romero takes some liberties with his depiction of &quot;The Craft,&quot; but Cripes, guys, what, do you just watch THE WICKER MAN over and over and over and over and over and over and over?

RomeroC: Jan White, Ray Laine, Ann Muffly, Joedda McClain, Bill Thunhurst, Virginia Greenwald, Neil Fisher, Esther Lapidus, Dan Mallinger, Daryl MontgomeryP: A bored housewife takes up with the local neighborhood witch, but fears she may have overstepped her bounds by using spells for reckless purposes.As commentary on the feminist movement, Season of the Witch works. As a character piece, Season of the Witch also works on that regard, because the film really gets to the heart of the main character- who she is, what she is all about. However, as entertainment, Season of the Witch isn't so successful. Sure, the film does have interesting moments where characters debate over certain ideas & notions. Some of the dream & hallucinogenic sequences are effective, but, overall, the pacing is so slow and so leisurely, that it often feels like the movie is heading nowhere, ten miles per hour at that.What a shame that is too! Season of the Witch obviously had something to say. It just never finds that balance between being actual entertainment, art and commentary.

She discovers Witchcraft and that she has 'talents' with which she uses to plot revenge and to liberate herself.McWiccans hate films like this because the Witch does not fit their own stereotype of ""hippie/pagan, nature-worshiping, patchouli-wearing oddballs"". Plus there's no mention of any rule of three nor karma so the Witch is left to herself as to how to proceed in dealing with life.To me, the Witch is empowered and realizes she does not have to take anyone else's crap any longer which is what self-empowerment is all about. So she does a little bad JuJu and has no patron goddess, still the Witch is fun to watch how she resolves conflict with spellwork.The ending is grand and a surprise to me.

Romero's third feature, SEASON OF THE WITCH. While Horror fans may find the suspense to be severely lacking, it is important to remember that the film was never intended to be included in the genre until its clever producers decided to bank on NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD's success. Instead, SEASON OF THE WITCH serves as a critical look at marriage and its part in the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1960s and 70s. Romero does little to progress the movement, however, and if anything, he sets it back another decade with this tawdry tale. His failed attempts at the avant-garde give SEASON OF THE WITCH the appearance of a cheap student film, and the stale performances do nothing to help. The camera hangs on dry, meaningless scenes well past their worth. It is only interesting to see just how far Joan is willing to go in order to find some satisfaction in life, but this still leaves for little payoff in the end.

The movie starts off very surreal and atmospheric seeming to give ""Rosemary's Baby"" a run for it's money. But just as you're beginning to think, ""this movie's awesome"" it very quickly lapses into a very conventional, melodramatic and not very scary storyline about a typical suburban housewife bored with her humdrum life who decides to spice things up by dabbling in witchcraft. For the remainder of the film you are waiting for it to return to the creepiness it began with and it never does. You end up being very annoyed by the lead actress Jan White and her dull, whiny persona and the stupid recurring dream she has about an intruder with a dumb looking wolfman (I think) mask on breaking into her house and molesting her.I give the film two stars instead of just one because it was good in the beginning.

Notable only for Jan White and Ray Laine.________________________________There's Always Vanilla (1971)  -Side B-This film stars Raymond Laine and Judith Ridley (Streiner) {Night of the Living Dead 1968}. No, this film is not The Red Balloon.Chris is tired of playing his music for other music groups so he decides to head for Pittsburgh, after 3 years away, to see his father.  At the PAAC rail station, he meets Gwen, a model. He helps her get the gig for a tv commercial. A romance begins.  Chris is really a good guy with good nature, patience and a sense of humor.  Gwen has started to become a flake.  Will this romance blossom or will she fizzle out?Spoiler: This film is probably the most realistic love story of its time, but the ending left me flat.The film is enjoyable due to the natural acting talents of Ray Laine.  By today's standards, he would be a cross between Lou Rossi, George Clooney and Russel Crowe.Ray Laine went on to become a schoolteacher.  He did do several more film appearances.  Ray Laine died in 2000 from cancer.Also in the cast: Russel Streiner (Night of the Living Dead 1968), Joe Rosso and Richard Ricci.Side A: A 2005 interview with Jan White.

He is one of my all time favorite horror directors and I have seen almost all of his films. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is my favorite horror movie. Sadly Season of the Witch is not his greatest effort and is frankly one of my least favorite films. The story movies very slowly and the subject matter is unappealing. The characters are one dimensional (unlike Romero's other features) and are unsympathetic. I can't find, no matter how hard I try, to find one aspect of this film I like. If your a Romero fan, like me, don't expect a whole lot out of this cheap effort, it doesn't even begin to tread the same grounds as Romero's other films. I also was disapppointed in the picture quality. Usually Anchor Bay horror films are crystal clear and amazing. Season of the Witch, even though the box says Digitally Remastered, still has a muddy look. Also the box says the title Season of the Witch but he film itself says Jack's Wife. Is it really that big of a problem to put the actual name of the movie one the box?

Season of the Witch is not a gore movie but a charmingly dated period piece detailing  a 1970's housewife's frustrations as she becomes less involved in her families lives, (her only child is ready to leave for college and her husband is much less concerned about his marriage as he is about his career) . The 1950's ideal family with the stay at home mom finally faded into American folklore by the early 1970's, replaced by daycare and double income households.  Witch illustrates this cultural shift poeticly through  a bored  housewife who no longer wants to be objectified as a ""general caretaker""  and wishes to change her life through ""magic"".  This story is solid and goes into some strange places.  If the movie was ever to be remade, as so many of Romero's films have, I would hope the setting would remain 1970-72, it truly is what makes this film special.

During a party she, and her friend, meet a couple who like to smoke dope and indulge in sexual experimentation.While she gets bored, she dabbles in witchcraft and, as a result, leaves her 'old life' behind and gets more and more involved in being a witch.With feminism and women's rights happening in the 1970's, Romero (and his wife Nancy), who produced the movie, succeed in having a film that celebrates wicca and other occult activities, and making a statement about how oppressed women should do other things apart from sitting in their houses bored to death with the day-to-day living....****""Season of the Witch"", (filmed as ""Jack's Wife"" and ""Hungry Wives""), offers the viewer a visual treat as dreams (real and/or imagined), and the sense of dread surfaces, as Jack mistreats his wife in several scenes, and ignoring his wife's needs in the process....""Season of the Witch"" also features the sensational title song by Donovan....The acting is excellent.With striking visuals, and lots of scares, it is a low budget masterpiece of terror from a master filmmaker.Romero has stated that he likes to re-make the movie with a bigger budget.Time will tell if he does.I rate the movie 5 stars.Highly recommended for fans of early George A.

The bad picture quality really adds to the feeling of the times and its like opening up a time capsule. The story line is a very real example of what the sexual revolution did to people's relationships. Free sex, abortions, illegitimate children, it's all here. I actually empathize with the characters. The main character seems unable to decide what he wants to do with his life and is afraid to commit to anything. I feel sorry for our female lead who sort of gets used by the guy.
