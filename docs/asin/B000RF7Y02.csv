1081358,A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,B000RF7Y02,Brian Reaves,"[12, 13]","The Amazing Johnathan is a hilarious guy. He's one of the top comedy magicians in the world today, and this special highlights why. Keep in mind this isn't for everyone though. One of his trademarks is the ability to find creative ways to give someone the finger, and he does so many times throughout.While this can't be described as family entertainment by any means, it IS a pretty funny way to spend an hour. His original Comedy Central Presents appearance is included here and though there are a few similar moments, there's enough new stuff to make it worth watching.I would have liked to have seen this cleaned up a bit so everyone could enjoy it, but at least it's out there. This show is almost exactly what aired on CC earlier this year. The ""Uncensored"" parts are mostly concerning not blurring out the finger and a couple of different props that weren't seen on the special.Not recommended for the family, but if you know what you're getting into it's funny. A little gross sometimes (the razor blade trick, for instance), but overall good.",4,Just what you'd expected,1188000000,"08 25, 2007",2007,1051,"['Amazing', 'Johnathan', 'hilarious', 'guy', 'one', 'top', 'comedy', 'magicians', 'world', 'today', 'special', 'highlights', 'why', 'Keep', 'mind', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'though', 'One', 'trademarks', 'ability', 'find', 'creative', 'ways', 'give', 'someone', 'finger', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'described', 'family', 'entertainment', 'means', 'pretty', 'funny', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'original', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'Presents', 'appearance', 'included', 'here', 'are', 'few', 'similar', 'moments', 'enough', 'new', 'stuff', 'make', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'cleaned', 'up', 'bit', 'everyone', 'could', 'enjoy', 'least', 'out', 'there', 'show', 'almost', 'exactly', 'what', 'aired', 'CC', 'earlier', 'year', 'Uncensored', 'parts', 'are', 'mostly', 'concerning', 'not', 'blurring', 'out', 'finger', 'couple', 'different', 'props', 'were', ""n't"", 'seen', 'special.Not', 'recommended', 'family', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'getting', 'funny', 'little', 'gross', 'sometimes', 'razor', 'blade', 'trick', 'instance', 'overall', 'good']",N/A
