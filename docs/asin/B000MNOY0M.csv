1047983,A1QI4ATF368A9B,B000MNOY0M,Allison,"[1, 1]","This movie is a rather effective thriller despite its lack of stars and big-budget. It creates a creepy atmosphere and is a hybrid of Saw and Se7en. The difference is that it creates chills without resorting to gratuitous nudity, language, or gore. It is a faith-based film but is definitely not a movie for the whole family. It will scare small children. It's a film about struggling with the demons within, how each of us has good and bad in us, and how God can help us deal with this dark struggle. Yes, it's a Christian film, but it doesn't beat the audience over its Christian themes and can be enjoyed by people of other faiths and non-believers. Most of the performances are good--particularly Marc Blucas as the hero battling The Riddle Killer, Laura Jordan as the hero's best friend/love interest, and Jennifer Waddell as a cop whose brother dies at the hand of the evil serial killer. The only performance that was disappointing was Priscilla Barnes as the hero's wacko, abusive aunt.

Turn out the lights, curl up to watch this edge of your seat thriller, and feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up...Kevin Parson is a seminary student working on his thesis, and is having some difficulty with writers block. On his way home from class one day, Kevin is contacted by RK -- a serial killer only known to the public as the ""Riddle Killer"", named so for his perverse penchant for stalking his victims with bizarre riddles, that only make sense once it's far too late. As Kevin embarks on a frighteningly twisted race against time, he is asked by the Riddle Killer to confess his sins...or die.This film was pure pulse-pounding adrenline from the very first opening sequence. Since it was a fairly small release, I had doubts as to whether or not it would be any good -- I can safely say my doubts have been laid to rest. Themes of good and evil are explored, with a whole lot of lives hanging in the balance. Does Good conquer all? Or is Evil too strong an opponent to triumph over? The best thing this film has going for it is it's ability to take the viewer on a thrill ride with so many twists, turns, and loopdy-loos that by the end you'll be screaming to get off this roller-coaster of death.I was pleasently surprised by this films ability to...well, surprise me (hey, give me a break, I'm writing this at 2 a.m.). After about a half-hour I was thinking ""okay, I've got it figured out. How unoriginal"", but I kept watching it anyway. A little while later my theory was debunked, and I was left thinking ""alright, no problem, I definitely know whats going on now""...only to have to renig on my 2nd theory and go back to square one. I assure you that unless you've read the book this movie is based from, you won't have any clue whats going on until the big reveal at the end --- I love that!As DVD's go, I'd say it's worth owning. There aren't any special features, only an option to watch some 'coming soon' trailers (in addition to the standard play, scene selections, and language features of course).

The ""killer ending"" is not a real mental disorder, has never been recorded as a mental disorder, is not even possible as a mental disorder even if it were made up by someone, and is far, far different from multiple personalities (Dissociative Identity Disorder). The whole ""psychiatric disturbance"" premise doesn't work at all simply because it doesn't follow real-world rules, or even movie rules. The ""motive"" behind it all is lunacy (not in the way the film means), and completely impossible and illogical. This is simply not how even the most disturbingly severe cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder work. They do not hallucinate every personality throughout life, contrary to what the fictitious A Beautiful Mind might have you believe. The disorder itself is represented here in a form that is so astronomically severe and unrestrainedly pathological that it's just...lame as hell. I can't like a film that takes the disorder and turns it into a fictitious, nonsensical drama because it makes for a ludicrous premise that flies out of reality and into some other realm where even movie logic is bent, as at least there's *some* accuracy in disorders sometimes when represented on-screen.

Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[32, 36]","Unless you've lived in a cave for the past few years, you've probably heard of Ted Dekker, the best-selling author of over a dozen novels. His twisty plots and suspense-filled stories have won him fans all over the globe. In 2003 Westbow Press (now Thomas Nelson) published Thr3e, Dekker's first hardcover novel. It's also the first of Dekker's books to make it to the big screen. And Thr3e, the movie, is everything you'd expect from a Dekker story. Action from the first shot, unrelenting suspense, and a nice slew of explosions.Kevin Parsons is a seminary student on the verge of great things. Then everything changes. Driving home from campus one fateful day, Kevin's cell phone rings. A gravelly, ominous voice demands he confess his sins in 90 seconds or his car will blow up--with him in it. Barely escaping with his life, Kevin's world flips when the killer contacts him again. And again. With the help of criminal psychologist Jennifer Peters (who believes the killer is the same psychopath who murdered her brother) and his childhood friend Samantha, Kevin desperately seeks to unravel the identity of the stalker. But how many innocent lives will be lost in the process? What ""sin"" is the killer talking about? And can Kevin really trust Jennifer with his life?Filmed in Poland with a 2.4 million budget and directed by Robby Henson, I found myself reminded of The Interpreter in several instances (the bus explosion, the darkness of some of the shots, and the suspense). Actor Marc Blucas makes Kevin jump off the pages and into our lives. He gives Kevin just enough innocence and empathy without making him a weakling. Although the child actors in the movie come off somewhat wooden, Jennifer and Sam (played by Justine Weddell and Laura Jordan respectively) are both strong female leads and do an equally stellar job bringing their characters to life. Justine shows us the conflict Jennifer feels between finding her brother's killer and becoming too emotionally involved in the case.Dekker fans will no doubt be wondering how close this movie stays to the book. There is a subplot added involving a student named Henry (played by Kevin Downes of The Moment After and Six fame). The library explosion is missing, but it's replaced with a refrigerator blowing up. None of the adjustments detracted from my enjoyment of the film. In fact, they only added depth to the experience. For example, the very first scene of the movie dramatizes the death of Jennifer's brother, and unlike the book, Jennifer is actually with him. This scene sets the pace for the whole movie and helps us experience Jennifer's anguish over her brother's death in ways the book didn't. For those who haven't read the book, Thr3e is a thriller worth watching whether you're a Dekker devotee or not.Rated PG-13 for violence and some disturbing images, you might want to think twice about taking children, but teens and adults will find the movie up to par with the latest blockbuster thrillers. The spiritual take-away value is much the same as the book--nothing overt. However, Dekker's Christian world view is evident, and one of the movie's additions is a riddle about the verse in Romans, The wages of sin is death.Thr3e will definitely please ""The Forest Guard"" (Dekker's inner circle of fans) and no doubt send others to the bookstore to pick up his body of work. With a powerful storyline and a killer ending, you'll be thinking about Thr3e long after the credits roll.--Reviewed by C.J.

I like horror, psychological suspense films, especially films that also incorporate Christianity (i.e.Lost Souls), but this was something else.I found the premise to be truly innovative: theology student Kevin is attempting to finish his thesis about the nature of good and evil, when a terrorizing killer, the Riddle Killer (aka RK), selects Kevin as his new victim.  ""RK"" wants Kevin to confess his greatest sin--a sin born of a traumatic childhood Kevin has tried to forget.  And even when Kevin ""confesses,"" RK dismisses it as not being his true sin.  But what else could Kevin possibly be hiding?  His childhood friend Samantha and police psychologist Jennifer have to figure it out before its too late.Even with some reviews and descriptions of this film giving away a lot more, I was still intrigued.  But the film itself has little to do with Christianity, there are few slight references thrown in (so if your apprehension with this film is the possibility of it being too preachy, don't worry you are safe from that).  The bad acting made the bad script look worse.  Kevin's childhood was too strange and not even explained well until the end.  And this explanation seemed a little too easy summed up for my taste.  In fact, I think that is why I dislike this movie so much.  It is supposed to be intense with so much going on, nothing makes sense, and then suddenly you are told everything so concisely.  The plot moves on to wrap up everything else, and then poof! happy ending!  90 minutes devoted to development and red herrings + 10 minutes to divulge everything + 5 minutes of a really stupid ending = 105 minutes of bad film.I like complex films that make you think, and this film had all the makings of a great thriller.

When I rented this DVD, I was curious to see if the translation from page to screen made the ending more believable.  To some extent it does, since Alan McElroy's screenplay leaves out some problematic scenes from the book, but the viewer may still feel cheated.The movie has decent production values considering its low budget, and the score establishes a tone of eerie menace, but alas, the poor quality of the performances ultimately sink the film.  Although Marc Blucas and Laura Jordan do a good job as Kevin and Sam, Justine Wadell is not credible or convincing as a top police investigator.

1047994,A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB,B000MNOY0M,Jake,"[3, 4]","Let's face it.  We live in a movie culture.  Every weekend millions flock to theaters to check out Hollywood's latest installment of movie entertainment.  More often than not we plop down $8-$10 for garbage and think little of it.  No doubt there are some diamonds in the rough, and good, quality, clean films can be found if you look hard enough.  But when will faith-based films find a place in our movie culture?  Is it just a futile dream to think that Christians will ever be able to influence Hollywood?  After watching Thr3e recently I am convinced more than ever that this dream is becoming a reality.Thr3e is based on the best-selling novel by Ted Dekker, and is the first theatrical release by Fox Faith.  This is a psychological thriller that tells the story of Kevin Parson, a troubled seminary student who finds himself the target of an insane serial killer.  Kevin (Marc Blucas) begins to receive threatening phone calls from the mad man demanding that he confess his past sins.  Criminal Psychologist Jennifer Peters (Justine Waddell) believes this mad man is the infamous Riddle Killer who murdered her brother, and she takes a special interest in Kevin's case.  Kevin enters into a deadly cat and mouse game that brings his troubled past to the surface.  Along with his best friend, Samantha (Laura Jordan), he must find out what the killer wants and how to stop him.Thr3e is a fast-paced thriller that balances action and suspense perfectly.  Fans of the novel will be pleased that the film maintains the integrity of the story, and the differences between novel and film are minor.  Thr3e was shot in Poland on a very limited budget, and neither aspect is obvious on screen.  Director Robby Henson does a masterful job of making all the parts work despite the limitations that many big-budget films don't have.  Marc Blucas shines in his role as Kevin, and the supporting cast holds their own.While this is a faith-based movie produced by a faith-based film company, Thr3e does not look like a Christian film and should not be labeled as a ""family film"".  There is no profanity, sex, or inappropriate scenes and the PG-13 rating is accurate because of the intensity of the film.  Many Christian critics have bashed Thr3e because there are no altar calls at the end or ""come-to-Jesus"" moments that one might expect from a Christian film.  However, Thr3e excels where other faith-based films have failed in the past: It is relevant!  This is a modern-day movie parable that both Christians and non-Christians can not only enjoy, but be challenged by.  Thr3e is all about the struggle between good and evil and the film challenges us all to consider our own personal spiritual condition.  The message is not thrown in our faces, and as a result is more effective.Thr3e is a giant step forward in faith-based film and entertainment.  Our collective hats should be off to Ted Dekker, Fox Faith, and the makers of this film for producing a movie that is entertaining, challenging, worth watching and relevant to our culture.

After seeing the film, I could tell it was a great thing I read the book beforehand. It's too bad Ted Dekker didn't have more a hand in helping out with this film like he did with the surprise ending of House. Out of all the actors, the only one that was convincing enough played Kevin's cousin (according to the book, he would've had to play a mentally retarded, yet grown man, and he does it very effectively). Aside from him, no one could convince me this was supposed to be a dark thriller almost at all. An explosion here, a little (or rather no) guesswork there, but nothing of actual substance. And, for being based on an award-winning suspense book (written by the man that would advance the guts of Christian publishing and keep pushing limits of what should be included in future literature), it seemed like the screenwriters just skimmed over bits and pieces of the book and decided to do it their own way. Which ruined pretty much ALL the suspense that made the book very memorable. Like what?*SPOILER ALERT*-Book: Slater gives a hint to Kevin by phone of the next victim while being vague, leaving Kevin to figure out who he was talking about.Movie: Slater goes right ahead and says the name of intended victim.-Book: A detective ends up trying to not think of Kevin as the perp, and thinks about alternative ways to conceal the human voice and alter it.Movie: this is nonexistent, not even as a deleted scene.-Book: It begins with a classroom setting and an interesting quote about knowledge and where it starts.Movie: It begins with the detective trying to rescue her brother from a bomb a madman set up. And failing. In the classroom, no interesting quotes about where knowledge comes from.-Book: After all is said and done,detective still wodners about a madman and where he could have gone. Making the actual villain she'd been hoping to get all throughout the book that much more mysterious. And intriguing.Movie: Madman is caught and seems less than intelligent with how he got caught. No intrigue at all, no mystery appeal.*SPOILERS END*Really, I don't know how they improved to House, but even with the girl that played Kevin's only childhood friend playing in House, it was still much better than this.

The script was really, REALLY bad.So many examples come to mind but I will force myself to only provide one: the bad guy calls Kevin to warn him that he only has 60 seconds to save a loved one named Damon.  The camera flashes to a photo of a child hugging a black lab.  We next see Kevin running out of his apartment in the city and into the suburbs, back to his crazy Aunt & Uncle's house.  He then stops to talk to his cousin Bobby and then tries to have a conversation with ""Princess"".  Finally, we discover Damon is the dog. Ummmm, all this took less then one minute?? and the photo is of himself as a little boy with Damon - just how is this dog still alive??The film is full of scenes and dialogue that just don't add up.  Maybe the movie suffers from bad editing but that shouldn't mean viewers have to suffer through it as well.  Acting was spotty yet entertaining: the female police doctor was wooden, the lead male detective was constantly sweating and looked seriously ill for no apparent reason (the actor is ok, right?), and I know ""Princess"" was crazy but Priscilla Barnes played her a too little over the top (I still kinda liked it - maybe campy was the goal?).  The most absorbing scenes for me involved Kevin's slow cousin Bobby and NOT the actual plot.  I felt for Bobby when he kept showing off his new computer game to various characters.  He always asked if they wanted to see it and every time I kept my fingers crossed that someone would look at poor Bobby's hand held video game.  Then I wondered why all of these scenes were kept in the film?  Scenes were a hodgepodge of misdirected clues leading to the finale.

Somewhat of a christian version of a horror film, The movie has some occasionally shocking twists. But, This film's apparant lack of originality hinders it from being a truly great movie. The villain here is clearly a rip-off of the Jigsaw Killer from ''Saw'' and the way he leaves cryptic, biblical messages and clues are very similar to the way the killer from ''Seven'' did those very same things. However, The ending, Which was shocking, Was something out of ''Fight Club''! The cast is comprised of strictly little-known actors and they all do a pretty decent job handling this material. Had it not been for the decent acting, This movie would've easily been far worse than what it is.

The acting is uneven (Priscilla Barnes is funny  and there's something about Justine Waddell's presence that I like, but she seems to be sleepwalking throughout the movie, and Marc Blucas doesn't feel right in the lead).The action and suspense sequences are pretty poor. The opening scene that's supposed to catch your interest - where Kevin gets the first phone call in his car - is especially weak. In the book, this was where the suspense started, in the movie, he more or less just drives off to the side of the road. Most of the following action scenes follow the same pattern. A weak script doesn't help either. The key scenes don't really come together. I understand that when adapting a novel you always have to make changes, but this screenwriter made some strange choices in what character development to keep and what to discard, and also added a subplot at the end, tying together a knot that was left loose in the book.The book had a good story, but this rather amateurish movie comes off as an attempt to make a more ""deep"" and ""spiritual"" version of ""Saw"" or ""Captivity"".

The killer tells Kevin to confess some hidden sin from his past, or else he and others will die.  Kevin is aided by Samantha (a childhood friend of Kevin's who reappears shortly after Kevin narrowly survives the bombing of his car) and by Jennifer (a criminal psychologist who's brother is murdered by RK during the opening sequence).  There are several action sequences during the first half of the movie (highlighted by several explosions), but it is very rare that someone actually dies.  It's not that the story necessarily needed a high body count, but repeatedly rescuing people in the nick of time is not the most effective way to build tension.  However, the second half of the movie is much better at building the tension and makes up for the shortcomings of the first half.  I especially enjoyed the unfolding of what was really going on when Samantha and Jennifer simultaneously put the pieces together...or do they?  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that I didn't see it coming.  (I know that this movie is based on a book, but I didn't read the book so I had no idea how it would end.)

Zwick,"[0, 0]","**1/2*BEWARE: SPOILERS*""Thr3e"" is one of those movies that hopes to so dazzle you with its ""surprise"" turnabout ending that you'll gladly forget all the tedium you had to sit through in order to get to that point (although, in this case, the twist isn't really all that original for anyone who's seen ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Femme Fatale"" or ""Abandon"").  For the vast majority of its running time, this is a thoroughly derivative, mediocre thriller that borrows shamelessly from virtually every serial killer film of the past thirty years, stretching at least as far back as ""Halloween"" (if not farther).  Thus, it's up to you to decide if the film redeems itself sufficiently in the final act to make it ultimately worth dedicating your time to it.With Ted Decker's novel as their source of inspiration, writer Alan B. McElroy and  director Robby Henson have pretty much lined up all their stereotypes and cliches in a neat little row, the easier to pick them off as the occasion arises.  We have, for instance, the masked killer himself who feels aggrieved by the treatment he received as a youngster - even though he was actually the bully in the neighborhood - and who has decided that the day of reckoning is finally at hand.  In the service of that goal, he contacts Kevin Parson (Marc Blucas), a seminary student, who, twenty years earlier, left Slater for dead and now must pay the price for that action.  Despite that spicy little detail, Kevin is actually a pretty bland, straight-laced, everyman-type hero - which seems rather odd considering he was raised in a household of freaks who look to be just a few chromosomes shy of being related to the Munsters.  The killer, of course, has devised the kind of Byzantine cat-and-mouse game that only an overpaid screenwriter could possibly come up with, a plan that involves mercilessly tweaking his victim, detonating bombs all over the place, devising incomprehensible riddles for Kevin to follow, threatening his loved ones, and issuing the standard order that Kevin is in no way, shape or form to ever try and contact the police, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (even though one of the main characters is a policewoman whose brother Slater kills after she writes a book about him that he feels doesn`t do him justice).The acting ranges from the merely serviceable to the downright amateurish, while Henson seems to feel that all he need do is provide a tangle of meaningless red herrings and a new explosion every five minutes or so to keep us interested.And as for that twist at the end that is somehow supposed to erase all the blandness of what has come before, I guess it all depends on how much you value your time and whether or not giving up 90 precious minutes of your life for a mere 10 minute payoff is a worthwhile investment of that time.  For me, it was an equation that never really balanced out.In this case, speaking mathematically as well as cinematically, ""Thr3e"" is far less than half of ""Seven.""",2,utterly cliched until the climax,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,2968,"['**1/2*BEWARE', 'SPOILERS*', 'Thr3e', 'one', 'movies', 'so', 'dazzle', 'surprise', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'gladly', 'forget', 'tedium', 'had', 'sit', 'order', 'get', 'point', 'case', 'twist', ""n't"", 'really', 'all', 'original', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Femme', 'Fatale', 'Abandon', 'vast', 'majority', 'running', 'time', 'thoroughly', 'derivative', 'mediocre', 'thriller', 'shamelessly', 'virtually', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'past', 'thirty', 'years', 'stretching', 'least', 'far', 'back', 'Halloween', 'not', 'farther', 'Thus', 'up', 'decide', 'film', 'sufficiently', 'final', 'act', 'make', 'ultimately', 'worth', 'dedicating', 'time', 'it.With', 'Ted', 'Decker', 'novel', 'source', 'inspiration', 'writer', 'Alan', 'B.', 'McElroy', 'director', 'Robby', 'Henson', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'lined', 'up', 'stereotypes', 'cliches', 'neat', 'little', 'row', 'easier', 'pick', 'off', 'occasion', 'have', 'instance', 'masked', 'killer', 'who', 'aggrieved', 'treatment', 'received', 'youngster', 'even', 'was', 'actually', 'bully', 'neighborhood', 'who', 'decided', 'day', 'reckoning', 'finally', 'hand', 'service', 'goal', 'Kevin', 'Parson', 'Marc', 'Blucas', 'seminary', 'student', 'who', 'twenty', 'years', 'earlier', 'left', 'Slater', 'dead', 'now', 'must', 'pay', 'price', 'action', 'spicy', 'little', 'detail', 'Kevin', 'actually', 'pretty', 'bland', 'straight-laced', 'everyman-type', 'hero', 'rather', 'odd', 'considering', 'was', 'raised', 'household', 'freaks', 'who', 'look', 'be', 'just', 'few', 'chromosomes', 'shy', 'being', 'related', 'Munsters', 'killer', 'course', 'devised', 'kind', 'Byzantine', 'cat-and-mouse', 'game', 'only', 'overpaid', 'screenwriter', 'could', 'possibly', 'come', 'up', 'plan', 'mercilessly', 'tweaking', 'victim', 'detonating', 'bombs', 'place', 'devising', 'incomprehensible', 'riddles', 'Kevin', 'follow', 'threatening', 'loved', 'ones', 'issuing', 'standard', 'order', 'Kevin', 'way', 'shape', 'form', 'ever', 'try', 'contact', 'police', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'even', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'policewoman', 'brother', 'Slater', 'kills', 'book', 'doesn', 't', 'do', 'justice', '.The', 'acting', 'ranges', 'merely', 'serviceable', 'downright', 'amateurish', 'Henson', 'feel', 'need', 'do', 'provide', 'tangle', 'meaningless', 'red', 'herrings', 'new', 'explosion', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'keep', 'interested.And', 'twist', 'end', 'somehow', 'supposed', 'erase', 'blandness', 'what', 'come', 'guess', 'how', 'much', 'value', 'time', 'not', 'giving', 'up', '90', 'precious', 'minutes', 'life', 'mere', '10', 'minute', 'payoff', 'worthwhile', 'investment', 'time', 'was', 'equation', 'never', 'really', 'balanced', 'out.In', 'case', 'speaking', 'mathematically', 'as', 'well', 'cinematically', 'Thr3e', 'far', 'less', 'half', 'Seven']",Thr3e

It's adored by millions of Ted Dekker fans worldwide. The twist ending is definitely a surprise and stands as one of Dekker's best.The film is basically a copy and paste of the book, WITHOUT any of the emotional characterization that made the book so worth it. It simply tells the story, and though all the same characters remain, only three of them are well casted by capable actors. The killer for example is cheesily voiced (to an almost laughable level) and feels like some cheap ripoff of the spooky and demonic voice acting of the killer in the ""Saw"" films. He also comes off as less threatening than some angry hippie who got the wrong latte in Starbucks. This is not also to mention the wooden psychologist/cop leading the investigation who heads a small group of other detectives who look like they'd all rather be somewhere else except this film.

In spite of the film's psycho killer story, ""Thr3e"" is not that chilling.

The ever-resourceful stalker keeps threatening him, sending messages to Kevin who just doesn't know anything. But soon Kevin realizes that he must take these anonymous messages very seriously when people around him (and his dog) are really in danger of being blown to pieces.Two female characters arrive to help him out: FBI psychologist and author Jennifer Peters (Justine Waddell) and Kevin's childhood friend Samantha (Laura Jordan).

Actually the idea itself has been done elsewhere many times, but director Robby Henson gives it a religious undertone, which is certainly unique. The originality ends here, however. Bland direction, disjointed storytelling, uninteresting flashbacks and overacting - they quickly kill the potential for the idea.

But it's pretty blatant in this one, and they didn't build upon those borrowed ideas...they don't  come close.Perhaps you had to read the book to enjoy this film. Some other reviewers have Given this 4 and 5 stars...I can't imagine why. If Jigsaw from Saw and Keifer Sutherland's character from Phone booth had a deficient child with movie making aspirations...it may have made this film.Confess or die is the general idea behind this poorly acted, poorly written dud.The DVD itself has the full screen version on one side, and wide screen on the other. That's a nice feature, and I did enjoy the score, it's the films only redeeming quality and the reason it gets 2 stars.  No special features on this version of the film....and I'm thankful. To write a thorough  review, I feel you have to watch  the whole film and the special features included.This one is for renting, or better yet try to catch it on TV if you must watch it.",2,Thr3e words...this film stinks!,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,1108,"['want', 'say', 'saw', 'rip-off', 'bunch', 'films', 'not', 'least', 'Fight', 'Club', ""'m"", 'sure', 'look', 'hard', 'enough', 'may', 'find', 'borrowing', 'most', 'films', 'pretty', 'blatant', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'build', 'borrowed', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'close.Perhaps', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'enjoy', 'film', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'Given', '4', '5', 'stars', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'why', 'Jigsaw', 'Saw', 'Keifer', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'Phone', 'booth', 'had', 'deficient', 'child', 'movie', 'making', 'aspirations', 'may', 'have', 'made', 'film.Confess', 'die', 'general', 'idea', 'poorly', 'acted', 'poorly', 'written', 'dud.The', 'DVD', 'full', 'screen', 'version', 'one', 'side', 'wide', 'screen', 'other', 'nice', 'feature', 'did', 'enjoy', 'score', 'films', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'reason', '2', 'stars', 'special', 'features', 'version', 'film', '.and', ""'m"", 'thankful', 'write', 'thorough', 'review', 'feel', 'have', 'watch', 'whole', 'film', 'special', 'features', 'included.This', 'one', 'renting', 'better', 'yet', 'try', 'catch', 'TV', 'must', 'watch']",Thr3e
