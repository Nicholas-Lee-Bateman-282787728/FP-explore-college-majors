463318,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,6305417377,Classic Movie watcher,"[1, 1]","Spencer Tracey continued to deliver a hilarious performance as a father-in-law who shunned his responsibility as a grandfather. The film stroke a deep chord in grandparents-to- be. Fighting over the choice of names, doctors, places to raise the baby. And Spencer Tracey portrayed a loving father, who worried and panicked, while his wife Joan Bennette may get overexcited at first but accepted the new changes with an eager heart. It was an ingenious touch to arrange the baby and grandfather to have a rocky start.Spencer Tracey was funny and assumed his role effortlessly. The story infused the emotional ups and downs of the expecting Elizabeth Taylor and the not so ready grandparent Spencer Tracey with laughter. The young and radiant Elizabeth Talyor certainly helps. The not so plausible factor would be the unreserved cooperation of the other parents-in-law. Spencer Tracey's narrative was cleverly crafted - what he said was timeless and applied now more than ever.",4,well written and well exceuted,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,974,"['Spencer', 'Tracey', 'continued', 'deliver', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'father-in-law', 'who', 'shunned', 'responsibility', 'grandfather', 'film', 'stroke', 'deep', 'chord', 'grandparents-to-', 'be', 'Fighting', 'choice', 'names', 'doctors', 'places', 'raise', 'baby', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'portrayed', 'loving', 'father', 'who', 'worried', 'panicked', 'wife', 'Joan', 'Bennette', 'may', 'get', 'overexcited', 'first', 'accepted', 'new', 'changes', 'eager', 'heart', 'was', 'ingenious', 'touch', 'arrange', 'baby', 'grandfather', 'have', 'rocky', 'start.Spencer', 'Tracey', 'was', 'funny', 'assumed', 'role', 'effortlessly', 'story', 'infused', 'emotional', 'ups', 'downs', 'expecting', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'not', 'so', 'ready', 'grandparent', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'laughter', 'young', 'radiant', 'Elizabeth', 'Talyor', 'certainly', 'not', 'so', 'plausible', 'factor', 'would', 'be', 'unreserved', 'cooperation', 'other', 'parents-in-law', 'Spencer', 'Tracey', 'narrative', 'was', 'cleverly', 'crafted', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'timeless', 'applied', 'now', 'more', 'ever']",N/A

463320,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6305417377,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[0, 1]","""Father's Little Dividend""(1951). . .This sequel to Spencer Tracy's better-known comedy hit, 1949's ""Father Of The Bride,"" is an odd film -- not a great success dramatically, but an amazing document of its time and an unusually serious and explicit examination of what starting a family back in the pre-feminist era of the early 1950s was like... Tracy reprises his role as Elizabeth Taylor's sweet but gruff father, but now instead of facing the challenge of ""giving away"" his daughter, now he's bent out of shape about becoming a grandfather. It makes him feel too old; he's thrown into competition with the other grandparents; his daughter gets overwrought and emotional, and after all that, when the baby is finally born, the little booger cries every time he sees Grandpa!A lot of this film will be fascinating to our baby-obsessed present-day culture. There's a great scene where, as Tracy comforts his pregnant daughter after all the other grandparents have been too controlling and intrusive, she tells him about her wonderful new, progressive-minded doctor, who turns out to be some kind of kook who advocates that parents (well, mothers) carry their babies around everywhere for the first two years, and he freaks out and goes to the doctor behind her back to give him a piece of his mind: what's completely normal and commonplace now in 2013 was beyond the pale back in '51... You can't carry babies around! That's crazy talk!!  Also surprising is a scene where Tracy's wife scolds him for being so negative after the kids announce their pregnancy -- he complains that they're too young and too naive to have a child, and she reminds him that they had their first child born out wedlock, three months before they got married, and that she had to miss her high school graduation because she was knocked up at the time: not quite the sanitized Ozzie & Harriet world we imagine in the post-WWII era.Overall, the script is fairly flat, basically a checklist of problems that can confront a young family, viewed through the lens of their parents, and the movie moves from set piece to set piece without building up much actual narrative momentum. Still, it's an interesting snapshot of white American culture at a particular moment in time, and is more frank about a lot of marital issues than one might imagine. Plus, it stars a 20-year old Elizabeth Taylor, and she's wonderful to see onscreen. Other reviewers have dinged this film because of the low-quality remastering and while I watched a different edition, the one I saw was also pretty blurry and muffled -- but I rated it based on the calibre of the film itself, not the technical quality of any particular edition. It's not a great movie, but it's worth checking out from a historical perspective.

DigicomTv has done a remarkable, amazing job in remastering this wonderful classic! Audio and video quality are superb! The best I've ever seen!Wonderful, heartwarming story with the quintessential Spencer Tracy at his best! Tracy has plans for his life now that his three children are grown and he has money in the bank, and no mortgage on the house. But, fate has other plans for his new found freedom - he's about to become a grandfather.Tracy struggles with the idea that his life is about to change when Kay, his beloved daughter, played beautifully by Elizabeth Taylor, becomes pregnant. Tracy doesn't really want to become a grandfather, he would rather travel the world with his lovely wife, but he accepts the idea that the role of grandfather is his whether he wants it or not.One spring day, Tracy is left to babysit the new baby and takes him out to the park for an outing. Tracy gets distracted with a group of boys playing soccer, and leaves the baby alone in his carriage without supervision. When Tracy finally returns to the carriage, the carriage and baby are missing. Tracy panics, looking everywhere for his grandson. He finally makes his way to the police station to report the missing child, and finds out that they have recovered the baby from the park. Tracy begs them not to phone his daughter, but instead promises the police this kind of thing will never happen again! Tracy returns home with the baby, and at the christening for the child, Tracy discovers that his grandchild has been named after him, he is ecstatic! Grandfather and grandson become inseparable afterwards - grandfather and grandson living happily ever after!!This is a warm and touching film no person should ever miss! It is reminiscent of times when life was sweeter, simpler, and happy endings actually did exist.... Don't miss this wonderful remastered movie.

Stanley Banks (Spencer Tracy) and Ellie Banks (Joan Bennett) are happily married couples; when their daughter Kay Banks (Elizabeth Taylor) marries Buckley Dunstan (Don Taylor) and moves out of the house. The family tries to settle down without Kay in the house; but soon the news of Kay becoming a mother hits harder to Stanley and Ellie than Kay. Stan still feels romantic towards his wife but the news of him becoming a grandfather is a little unsettling. In addition, constant meddling of Kay's in-laws, Herb Dunstan (Moroni Olsen) and Doris Dunstan (Billie Burke) in planning the lives of their son and daughter in law, and flaunting the wealth and money is not only annoying but obnoxious to Banks. Ellie banks shows equal interest in decorating the house and helping the young family, but this is a little more than what Kay had bargained for a married life.  The movie revolves around Stanley Banks and the usual changes and adjustments in life after ones daughter gets married and the arrival of new members of the family. This has all the drama of a typical family; Elizabeth Taylor looks adorable, and offers fine performance as the daughter of proud father Stanley banks. Although the first movie (Father of the Bride) was highly touted with nods from Academy during nominating process in the categories of best picture and best actor, this movie was not nominated in any category.1.Father of the Bride (Snap case)",3,A Family Spoof starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor,1190678400,"09 25, 2007",2007,1534,"['movie', 'was', 'produced', '1951', 'success', 'Father', 'Bride', 'also', 'directed', 'Vincent', 'Minnelli', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Ellie', 'Banks', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'are', 'happily', 'married', 'couples', 'when', 'daughter', 'Kay', 'Banks', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'Buckley', 'Dunstan', 'Don', 'Taylor', 'house', 'family', 'settle', 'down', 'Kay', 'house', 'soon', 'news', 'Kay', 'becoming', 'mother', 'harder', 'Stanley', 'Ellie', 'Kay', 'Stan', 'still', 'romantic', 'wife', 'news', 'becoming', 'grandfather', 'little', 'unsettling', 'addition', 'constant', 'meddling', 'Kay', 'in-laws', 'Herb', 'Dunstan', 'Moroni', 'Olsen', 'Doris', 'Dunstan', 'Billie', 'Burke', 'planning', 'lives', 'son', 'daughter', 'law', 'flaunting', 'wealth', 'money', 'not', 'only', 'annoying', 'obnoxious', 'Banks', 'Ellie', 'banks', 'equal', 'interest', 'decorating', 'house', 'helping', 'young', 'family', 'little', 'more', 'what', 'Kay', 'had', 'bargained', 'married', 'life', 'movie', 'Stanley', 'Banks', 'usual', 'changes', 'adjustments', 'life', 'ones', 'daughter', 'married', 'arrival', 'new', 'members', 'family', 'drama', 'typical', 'family', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'adorable', 'fine', 'performance', 'daughter', 'proud', 'father', 'Stanley', 'banks', 'first', 'movie', 'Father', 'Bride', 'was', 'highly', 'touted', 'nods', 'Academy', 'nominating', 'process', 'categories', 'best', 'picture', 'best', 'actor', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'nominated', 'category.1.Father', 'Bride', 'Snap', 'case']",N/A

463341,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6305417377,Westley,"[2, 3]","Most of the original cast of ""Father of the Bride"" (1950) returns for this cute sequel.  Spencer Tracy and Joan Bennett play the parents of Elizabeth Taylor, who married in the prior movie and is now expecting a child.  Bennett reacts with excitement and is prepared for her daughter to move back home so that she can help raise the child.  Tracy, on the other hand, is horrified at the prospect of being a grandfather and has a mid-life crisis of sorts.  The movie did almost as well as the original, finishing as the #11 money-maker of 1951.With Vincente Minnelli at the helm, you know that the movie can't be bad.  It's cute and the cast is fine.  In addition, at just 82 minutes in length, the movie really flies by quickly; however, it's just too insubstantial and predictable.  I smiled a few times but never really laughed.  Accordingly, whereas ""Father of the Bride"" was nominated for a boatload of Oscars, including Best Picture, ""Father's Little Dividend"" was shut out of the nominations.  Overall, ""Father's Little Dividend"" is a mildly amusing and likeable romp but probably not a must-have for your collection.",3,Cute Sequel,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1123,"['Most', 'original', 'cast', 'Father', 'Bride', '1950', 'cute', 'sequel', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'Joan', 'Bennett', 'play', 'parents', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 'who', 'married', 'prior', 'movie', 'now', 'expecting', 'child', 'Bennett', 'excitement', 'prepared', 'daughter', 'move', 'back', 'home', 'can', 'help', 'raise', 'child', 'Tracy', 'other', 'hand', 'horrified', 'prospect', 'being', 'grandfather', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'sorts', 'movie', 'did', 'almost', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'finishing', '11', 'money-maker', '1951.With', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'helm', 'know', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'cute', 'cast', 'fine', 'addition', 'just', '82', 'minutes', 'length', 'movie', 'really', 'flies', 'quickly', 'however', 'just', 'too', 'insubstantial', 'predictable', 'smiled', 'few', 'times', 'never', 'really', 'laughed', 'Accordingly', 'Father', 'Bride', 'was', 'nominated', 'boatload', 'Oscars', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'was', 'shut', 'nominations', 'Overall', 'Father', 'Little', 'Dividend', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'likeable', 'romp', 'probably', 'not', 'must-have', 'collection']",N/A
