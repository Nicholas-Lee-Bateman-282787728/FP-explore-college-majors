342512,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302874521,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 9/11Rate: 39/11: Quicksilver is so bad that it is a waste of Kevin Bacon's talents. I am sure, like with Footloose, he must have uttered to himself upon seeing the screenplay, ""You must be sh...ing me."" And then, he proceeds with it, wearing a straight face as hard as he can. Some have classified Quicksilver as a stock market film. Well...there is so little of it that it hardly qualifies as one. On the other hand, Kevin had to work with one of the worst group of actors and actresses of the 80's: the  blatantly lame Paul Rodriguez, the obscenely mannequin Jami Gertz, and the fat man Louie Anderson. Hm, the story of Quicksilver is...I don't right know. It's all random to me. Throw in the typical cheesiness of 80's into the Quicksilver, and you've got the ultimate 80's flick. If you look a bit closely at the settings, it does not really take place in New York City but San Francisco. I am not sure if the movie is meant to be in New York City instead. It gets very confusing to me. As you notice the bikes used in the film, they are Raleigh models, and they are damned heavy bikes. Plus, notice why many can spin around the front side? It's because there are no brakes wires attached to the handlebars. For somebody like Jami Gertz, given her looks, there is just no way she would have been reduced to a bike messenger. Try for some realism next time, please. All in all, if you are interested in a bike film for the hell of it, go with American Flyers and ditch Quicksilver.",2,Similar to Flashdance But on Bikes.,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,1492,"['Viewed', '9/11Rate', '39/11', 'Quicksilver', 'so', 'bad', 'waste', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'talents', 'am', 'sure', 'Footloose', 'must', 'have', 'uttered', 'seeing', 'screenplay', 'must', 'be', 'sh', 'ing', 'then', 'wearing', 'straight', 'face', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'have', 'classified', 'Quicksilver', 'stock', 'market', 'film', 'Well', 'so', 'little', 'hardly', 'one', 'other', 'hand', 'Kevin', 'had', 'work', 'one', 'worst', 'group', 'actors', 'actresses', '80', 'blatantly', 'lame', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'obscenely', 'mannequin', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'fat', 'man', 'Louie', 'Anderson', 'Hm', 'story', 'Quicksilver', 'do', ""n't"", 'right', 'know', 'random', 'Throw', 'typical', 'cheesiness', '80', 'Quicksilver', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ultimate', '80', 'flick', 'look', 'bit', 'closely', 'settings', 'not', 'really', 'take', 'place', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'San', 'Francisco', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'instead', 'very', 'confusing', 'notice', 'bikes', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'Raleigh', 'models', 'are', 'damned', 'heavy', 'bikes', 'notice', 'why', 'many', 'can', 'spin', 'front', 'side', 'are', 'brakes', 'wires', 'attached', 'handlebars', 'somebody', 'Jami', 'Gertz', 'given', 'looks', 'just', 'way', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'bike', 'messenger', 'Try', 'realism', 'next', 'time', 'please', 'are', 'interested', 'bike', 'film', 'hell', 'go', 'American', 'Flyers', 'ditch', 'Quicksilver']",Quicksilver VHS

342515,A3S738GO35SH0W,6302874521,Greg Hughes,"[6, 6]","I saw this film late last night on cable. I've got a feeling it might have glamorized the life of  bicycle messengers a tad. If &quot;Quicksilver&quot; was meant to inspire all the kids out there who want to be couriers, I'm doubtful that it worked.Kevin Bacon stars as a trailblazing stockbroker (Jack Casey) who loses everything. Now he does his trailblazing in another way: he becomes a bicycle courier. His failure on the trading floor dented his confidence, and now cycling around the city, delivering messages, has become his life.Some of the camera angles with the cycling scenes were pretty good. Did Bacon do his own stunts? The movie lacks a few things such as plot and believability, but it's fairly watchable. The best part was towards the end, when Jack was gallantly leading the &quot;bad guy&quot; away from  &quot;the girl&quot;. The relentless car chase was funny.Some of the filming was done in New York (I think) and also in San Francisco. I assumed the film was set in New York since the main character was a stockbroker. I read that the film was shot in three different cities but I don't know what the third was. Like some of the bicycle riders, the film stumbles.

He basically drops out and goes from the highest level of the economy to the lowest.  He buys a used bike and starts riding for a delivery service.  (I have no idea where the idea of evil bosses came into the Amazon review, the boss at the messenger service comes across as a decent guy.)  A young woman named Terri is hired and soon becomes the target of Gypsy, a drug dealer and ne'er do well that would like to enslave her as a prostitute.  Paul Rodriguez also is in the mix as an experienced courier that wants to raise enough money to buy a hot-dog cart so he can leave the courier business behind.The drama of the movie centers around Gypsy's efforts to enslave Terri and the climax is a car/bicycle chase where Kevin Bacon outwits Gypsy and sends him plunging from an earthquake damaged bridge.  In the end, Bacon's confidence is restored and he finds an opportunity in the markets that can put him back in the game.  Calling in favors from old friends he makes the trade and wins big which allows him to get back on top, restore his parent's losses, help Terri to a better life and finance Rodriguez's new cart.As far as Marshall Fine is concerned, let's just say that you should be a bit embarrased to have written such an innacurate review of a movie that an 12 year old could have understood but you obviously didn't.Overall the movie is entertaining if a bit of a stretch in places.  The overall plot is feasible although the Gypsy character strains credibility a bit IMO.  At the end it's a feel good movie with a happy ending and promise of a bright future for all of the heroes.

Peterson,"[1, 2]","this movie was boring. it was short on dialog. it really didn't make any sense. it was if someone tried (not so hard) back in the 80s to launch the popluarity for cyclists/bike messengers. throughout the entire movie I was thinking . . . where are the place in this town (which was SF but I don't think they ever said it was SF and where people referred to part of their town like it was Manhattan and where people spoke like they were from Harlem). Anyway there were stupid car chase scenes where a car is chasing a cyclist, trying to run it down. Of course the streets are deserted.And of course there are no police to be seen. There is some violence where a woman gets roughed up. Again no police. The cyclists are riding contrary to traffic. Where are the police? I have been to SF and Manhattan many times. And everywhere you look there are people and police. So this looks staged. Kevin Bacon looked like some pedophile in the opening scenes with his mustache and slicked back hair. Then he looked like a girl with his beret on riding his bike. Then he looked like a 9 year old boy in later scenes. But he talked like, and we are supposed to be believe,  he was a rich male stock market genius. Even when he was wearing reading glasses in one scene it looked like they were trying to dress this girl/kid looking guy up into an adult. It looked fake. Pretend. And as far as the plot (if there really was one) goes . . . who loses their parents' savings and then goes and gets a less than minimum wage job? Most of us would get 3 jobs to restore our parents' savings. Not this guy. But he is supposed to be a good guy. The hero of the plot. And what kinda plot involves the hero returning to his confident ways to make money for the ""poor Mexican"" . . . not to get a restaurant but to get his life's dream of owning a hotdog stand?
