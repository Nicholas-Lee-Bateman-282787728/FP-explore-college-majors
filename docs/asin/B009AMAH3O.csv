Sibling rivals from the Planet BAAB, with brainiac Gary Supernova [Rob Corddry] who works all the gizmos at Mission Control, while his butch stud brother Scorch Supernova [Brendan Fraser] performs all the all the superhero stuff. But when Scorch is sent on an SOS operation to the Dark Planet [otherwise known as Planet Earth], from which no alien has ever returned &#8211; it&#8217;s up to gary to rescue him, their planet and the universe. This out-of-the-world fun includes a stellar vocal cast including Jessica Alba, Sarah Jesica Parker, William Shatner, George Lopaz, Craig Robinson, Sofia Vergara and Jane Lynch.Voice Cast: Rob Corddry, Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, William Shatner, Jessica Alba, Craig Robinson, George Lopez, Jane Lynch and Sof&iacute;a VergaraDirector: Carl BrunkerProducers: Catherine Winder, Donna Gigliotti, Luke Carroll and Tony LeechScreenwriters: Bob Barlen and Cal BrunkerComposer: Aaron ZigmanCinematography: Matthew A.

However, when it comes to 'Escape From Planet Earth,' the fun almost exclusively comes from seeing it in 3D. In fact, I'll go as far as to say not to even waste your time with it if you don't already have a 3D-TV.Directed by first-timer Cal Brunker, 'Escape From Planet Earth' is another computer animated kids' film that seems to struggle constantly with whether it wants to be a 1950's B-movie spoof or a feel-good family movie. When it tries to be the former, it shows sparks of fun and originality. When it tries to be the latter, it's no better (and sometimes worse) than hundreds of other titles in its genre. Sadly, it does much more of the latter than the former.The films opens with viewers being introduced to two blue-coloured alien brothers &#8211; the older, brainier, and the nerdier Gary Supernova [Rob Corddry] and the younger, stronger, and dimmer Scorch Supernova [ Brendan Fraser]. Although they're brothers, they're essentially the Woody and Buzz Lightyear of this movie. Scorch has just returned from rescuing some babies from a hostile planet, when it's learned that the next mission will be to the &#34;dark planet,&#34; which turns out to be Earth. After a disagreement, however, Gary tells Scorch he's quitting, leaving Scorch to go to Earth by himself. He isn't there long before he's kidnapped by government agents &#8211; something that Gary and the residents of his planet are able to view back home on their version of the news.Gary decides to go to Earth to try and rescue his brother, but he isn't there long before he's captured himself and put into one of the holding cells in Area 51. He learns of a plan by General William T. Shanker (no bonus points for guessing the voice actor here!) to use a weapon to destroy Gary's and other captured aliens' home worlds. The second half of the movie involves Gary and his new alien friends [Craig Robinson, George Lopez, and Jane Lynch] attempting to thwart the General's plans, rescue his brother, and &#8211; of course &#8211; escape from planet Earth.While the plot is razor thin, some of the sight gags are going to be appealing for older viewers, and most involve Gary and Scorch's fish-out-of-water situation. There are a couple scenes at a 7-11 in the desert that provide a few laughs (including Gary getting his first taste of a Slurpee), as well as a series of Area 51 jokes that will bring a smile to the face of all the Fox Mulders in the audience.But the real way to view 'Escape From Planet Earth' is in the awesome 3D Blu-ray, as the film takes full advantage of the format by throwing some stunning visuals at viewers, even when the storyline is less than engaging. The movie has fun at both shooting things out at the audience while providing the kind of depth and clarity that 3D aficionados love. The 3D version is also presented in 1.85:1 (instead of the more opened-up 2:39:1 of the 2D version), so the filmmakers can make use of the black top and bottoms of the screen to enhance the 3D presentation. At times, snowflakes, explosions, lasers, and even parts of characters will overlap into the black portions of the image to give a little added fun to the 3D image. For those of you who remember the flying fish scene in the 3D version of Ang Lee's Life of Pi, that's the best way to describe how 'Escape From Planet Earth' has fun with its 3D presentation.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; The real incentive for getting this Blu-ray title is to view the film in 3D, and Anchor Bay has given viewers a top-notch transfer, full of bright colours and sharp details. Granted, as is the case with all 3D viewing, people say the 3D glasses are going to dim the picture a bit, but here in the UK, watching this 3D Blu-ray on my SAMSUNG SMART 3D Television with my SAMSUNG 3D Glasses, there is none of this diming problem, but as 3D Blu-rays go, this is one of the BEST animated titles I own. If you're looking to show off the 3D capabilities on your television, this comes close to reference quality.Equally impressive is the 2D version, even though I think all the fun of the film comes from watching it in 3D. Once again, a near reference quality transfers here, with no complaints and plenty of simply gorgeous animated shots. It's a shame the script didn't quite live up to the animation effort, because visually-speaking the movie is pretty stunning.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; The audio is active and immersive, although not nearly to the degree that the action is on-screen. As one can imagine, the movie is packed with swooping spaceships, big fight sequences, and a lot of opportunities to have fun with the soundtrack. However, while all the speakers get plenty of activity, most of the directionality and rear speaker use is on the subdued side. Which is to say, it's present, but doesn't always provide the &#34;oomph&#34; you'd expect. Even with those minor complaints, the track is well-balanced (spoken dialogue, music, and background sounds are properly mixed) and there are no apparent defects (popping, hissing, or other issues).Where the audio is concerned, is that viewers will only get one soundtrack option per disc, with the 3D and 2D Blu-ray disc giving us an English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, while the DVD sports a 5.1 Dolby Digital track. Subtitles are available in English SDH and Spanish, but only for the 2D versions of the movie.Blu-ray Special features and Extras:Audio Commentary with Director Cal Brunker: The only noteworthy bonus for those over the age of 12 is this feature-length commentary from the director. While not always screen-specific, Mr. Brunker does provide some nice insights into the development of the movie, although he spends just as much time often commenting about what the characters motivations are in certain scenes. Like a lot of commentary tracks, this one was recorded shortly before the movie's theatrical release, so listeners won't get any feedback here about the movie's performance, critical reception, etc.The Making of 'Escape From Planet Earth' [21:00] While this behind the scenes documentary does contain comments/interview footage with most of the main cast, it's sadly little more than a fluff piece and extended advertisement for the movie.Alternate Takes & Deleted Scenes [4:00] This collection of deleted scenes (some of them only seconds long) just seems to be an excuse to present all of the completed but unused animation. There's nothing here that didn't deserve to get cut from the final product.How To Make An Animated Feature With Director Cal Brunker [4:00] A short little documentary on how an animated movie goes from storyboarding to pre-visualization to animation to compositing/final product.Music Featurettes [11:00] Broken up into three segments (which can be watched together or separately), this segment gives viewers the music video for &#34;Shooting Star&#34; by Owl City; an introduction by Delta Rae followed by a performance of &#34;What Matters Most&#34;; and then a segment from Cody Simpson about his song &#34;Shine Supernova&#34; which features highlights of the song, but never the full song itself.Finally, &#8216;Escape from Planet Earth&#8217; has a lot of fun exploring its characters and universe. Even if the film isn't a bastion of originality, it takes itself very lightly. It's a buoyant, bubbly, happy-go-lucky sort of movie that just rolls with limited range and cleverly mixes together its pieces into a movie that feels familiar but at the same time rather fresh. It's not an instant classic of its genre, but chances are younger ones will love it and parents with a Sci-Fi itch to scratch will enjoy it, too. Anchor Bay's Bu-ray 2D/3D combo release of &#8216;Escape from Planet Earth&#8217; features tip-top video, excellent audio and amazing few extras. If you read other peoples reviews, they say this is a very mediocre, well that is such tosh, as this it totally brilliant 3D animation and I loved every minute and was brilliant fun and I cannot find any fault with it and you will be a fool to pass this by and I am so proud to add this to my ever increasing animation Blu-ray Collection and especially 3D Blu-ray discs, which I really love and is a massive bonus to me personally, despite people are predicting the demise of anything to do with 3D, as at most times they look so much more superior to what 3D you see in the cinema.

Gary runs operations from mission control on a computer console while Scorch is the one risking his life and using his muscle to solve every problem. Scorch is ordered to the Dark planet, Earth, for a rescue mission and after a falling out with Gary goes on the mission alone and gets captured by the diabolical general of Area 51 General Shanker (Willliam Shatner) in the process.Feeling guilty, Gary puts family before common sense and attempts to rescue his brother only to also succumb to General Shanker's treacherous grasp. Shanker has been keeping aliens captive in order to build a giant laser ray. Among those imprisoned are a three eyed slug named Thurman (George Lopez), a giant cyclops named Io (Jane Lynch), and a tiny Furby-sized genius named Doc (Craig Robinson). Despite the promise of returning home after the laser ray sees completion, Gary is the only one who expects a double cross from Shanker.The humor of ""Escape from Planet Earth"" really never finds its own groove. It attempts this spitfire approach early on where the characters say something ridiculous, which is immediately followed by that ludicrous concept being brought to life in a visual gag. It also resorts to silly faces, gross out humor, and sequences that feel like they're trying too hard more than anything. Bottom line, the animated film isn't very funny at all.Scorch putting up a fight at a 7-Eleven is the closest thing to a decent action sequence in the film and Gary fixing the blutonium for the laser ray is almost clever. Too bad it's all too incredibly obvious to really appreciate. Doc's explanation of tech history tries so hard to be amusing, but really just feels recycled like everything else. The animated film is too busy burrowing ideas from other well-established franchises to really flourish as its own entity.What you have left is a bunch of scraps leftover from far too many films to name. The storyline is completely worn out. There have been countless films of an alien race crashing on Earth only to be held captive for some reason; either for dissection, technology, or bragging rights more often than not. You can see the resolve for setups to not only comedy gags, but big action sequences and plot points as well, coming as soon as they're introduced. Even the character designs are bland and lacking. There's nothing there to wow you or reel you in. And why does it seem like George Lopez is in every second string animated film that comes along?""Escape from Planet Earth"" doesn't even try to make itself memorable. The entire film seems like a case of unwanted deja vu with a cast of mostly washed up actors. It's like a generic case of really uncomfortable indigestion that you'll forget about as soon it ends.While there wasn't an opportunity to go through all of the special features, the deleted scenes and alternate takes are noteworthy for mostly one reason. Most of the time when an animated film like this includes deleted scenes on their home release they're just the animatics, the sketches, the storyboards, or the original concepts. The deleted scenes on ""Escape from Planet Earth"" are fully animated, which is really bizarre and only feels like an even bigger waste of time and money. The other interesting thing about these deleted scenes is that Thurman is voiced by somebody that isn't George Lopez.",2,Self-destruct sequence initiated,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,3435,"['Gary', 'Supernova', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'always', 'bailing', 'brother', 'Scorch', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'trouble', 'Gary', 'operations', 'mission', 'control', 'computer', 'console', 'Scorch', 'one', 'risking', 'life', 'using', 'muscle', 'solve', 'problem', 'Scorch', 'ordered', 'Dark', 'planet', 'Earth', 'rescue', 'mission', 'falling', 'out', 'Gary', 'mission', 'alone', 'captured', 'diabolical', 'general', 'Area', '51', 'General', 'Shanker', 'Willliam', 'Shatner', 'process.Feeling', 'guilty', 'Gary', 'family', 'common', 'sense', 'attempts', 'rescue', 'brother', 'only', 'also', 'succumb', 'General', 'Shanker', 'treacherous', 'grasp', 'Shanker', 'been', 'keeping', 'aliens', 'captive', 'order', 'build', 'giant', 'laser', 'ray', 'imprisoned', 'are', 'three', 'eyed', 'slug', 'named', 'Thurman', 'George', 'Lopez', 'giant', 'cyclops', 'named', 'Io', 'Jane', 'Lynch', 'tiny', 'Furby-sized', 'genius', 'named', 'Doc', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'promise', 'returning', 'home', 'laser', 'ray', 'completion', 'Gary', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'double', 'cross', 'Shanker.The', 'humor', 'Escape', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'really', 'never', 'own', 'groove', 'spitfire', 'approach', 'early', 'where', 'characters', 'say', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'immediately', 'followed', 'ludicrous', 'concept', 'being', 'brought', 'life', 'visual', 'gag', 'also', 'silly', 'gross', 'humor', 'sequences', 'feel', ""'re"", 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'more', 'anything', 'Bottom', 'line', 'animated', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'funny', 'all.Scorch', 'putting', 'up', 'fight', '7-Eleven', 'closest', 'thing', 'decent', 'action', 'sequence', 'film', 'Gary', 'fixing', 'blutonium', 'laser', 'ray', 'almost', 'clever', 'Too', 'bad', 'too', 'incredibly', 'obvious', 'really', 'appreciate', 'Doc', 'explanation', 'tech', 'history', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'amusing', 'really', 'just', 'feels', 'recycled', 'everything', 'else', 'animated', 'film', 'too', 'busy', 'burrowing', 'ideas', 'other', 'well-established', 'franchises', 'really', 'flourish', 'own', 'entity.What', 'have', 'left', 'bunch', 'scraps', 'leftover', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'name', 'storyline', 'completely', 'worn', 'out', 'have', 'been', 'countless', 'films', 'alien', 'race', 'crashing', 'Earth', 'only', 'be', 'held', 'captive', 'reason', 'dissection', 'technology', 'bragging', 'rights', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'can', 'see', 'resolve', 'setups', 'not', 'only', 'comedy', 'gags', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'plot', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'coming', 'as', 'soon', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Even', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'bland', 'lacking', 'nothing', 'there', 'wow', 'reel', 'why', 'seem', 'George', 'Lopez', 'second', 'string', 'animated', 'film', 'along', 'Escape', 'Planet', 'Earth', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'make', 'memorable', 'entire', 'film', 'case', 'unwanted', 'deja', 'vu', 'cast', 'mostly', 'washed', 'up', 'actors', 'generic', 'case', 'really', 'uncomfortable', 'indigestion', ""'ll"", 'forget', 'as', 'soon', 'was', ""n't"", 'opportunity', 'go', 'special', 'features', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'mostly', 'one', 'reason', 'Most', 'time', 'when', 'animated', 'film', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'home', 'release', ""'re"", 'just', 'animatics', 'sketches', 'storyboards', 'original', 'concepts', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Escape', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'are', 'fully', 'animated', 'really', 'bizarre', 'only', 'feels', 'even', 'bigger', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'other', 'interesting', 'thing', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Thurman', 'voiced', 'somebody', ""n't"", 'George', 'Lopez']",N/A

1590633,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B009AMAH3O,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 2]","Escape from Planet Earth opened around the globe to heartfelt shrugs and lots of not going to the theater. The bits of it that I saw in between the bits where I kept zoning out seemed okay. I got nothing bad to say about the animation, which is very good and colorful but not quite as eye-popping as the CG stuff in, say, The Croods or How to Train Your Dragon. No, man, the gripes concern other areas.The premise gives us a 180 twist on the alien abduction urban legend. On the planet Baab, hero astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) rakes in all the pub and the fan love, just check out his endorsements and how the masses and the media hang on his every word. Never mind that Scorch is brash and impulsive and dim-witted and that, more often than not, his bacon gets saved by his meek, nerdy brother, Gary (Rob Corddry), who runs Mission Control for each of Scorch's field ops.Sucks then for Scorch that a sibling spat splits him and Gary up, just in time for Scorch to deploy to the Dark Planet, somewhere in the uncharted sector of the galaxy, in response to an S.O.S. call. Alarmingly, 106 advanced lifeforms had previously landed on the Dark Planet, only to be never heard from again. But off goes Scorch, blithely. I did say dude was dim-witted. And when Scorch gets captured, can Gary Supernova, fretful as a granny crossing the street, break him out of Area 51, a secret facility where confined aliens are forced to produce the latest in Earth's hi-tech advances?If you don't know by now that the Dark Planet is actually our own planet Earth, then you must not have peeked at the movie title. The one scene that really drew chuckles out of me takes place moments after Scorch lands in the desert and he attempts to communicate with a flappy, perpetual-motioned, inflatable figure planted in front of a 7-Eleven. I spent pretty much the rest of the film trying to turn my frown upside down.Goes to show that you could have an all-star voice cast (William Shatner, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jane Lynch, Jessica Alba, Ricky Gervais, etc.), and it means didd1y squat unless you've a tight script for them to read. Reportedly, seven different writers took a shot writing this thing, and then there's that lawsuit filed by story co-writer Tony Leech and producer Brian Inerfeld that accuses the Weinsteins of forcing 17 rewrites. Stuff like that tend to mess up a screenplay. What we're left with are weak, muddled story elements. The actors do their best but succumb to the albatross of uninteresting roles made drearier with flat character arcs - with the sole exception of Gary's indomitable stay-at-home action heroine wife, Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker). Frankly, I was clamoring for more scenes with Kira.In fact, the best bits are Ricky Gervais' wry computer interface and Parker's intrepid housewife. Both aren't in enough.The story tries to punch home the relevance of the modern-day nuclear family and how each member of the fam has something to contribute. But life lessons aren't as effectively imparted when presented this poorly. The film is wanting in real emotion and heart and anything really memorable. Yeah, it's probably a win with the younger kids because there are splashes of color and obvious sight gags and over-the-top cartoon figures to induce tons of chortling. But older kids who'd already seen better, wittier versions of this plot and these themes may come down with a sudden case of the yawns. The secondary characters come off as tacked on as if in a last-second effort to service the floundering narrative. Okay, I did like the aliens that sound like the Beatles.2.5 out of 5 stars for this mindless distraction. It tries to cater to the grown-ups with a barrage of pop-culture references, jokes that'll fly over the heads of the young 'uns. This works only if the adult jokes were actually funny. The ones here are mostly a fail and they're even dated, but I guess Simon Cowell appreciates that some folks still think he's relevant. So, yes, see this movie if you like smug Brits in really tight tee-shirts; that actually should've been the movie's tag line.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary by director Cal Brunker- The

1590647,A2RYXCJ91AQPS9,B009AMAH3O,judy,"[0, 0]","We come in piece. This is the first animated movie from 2013 that I have watched. As well as this being the first animated movie off 2013, which was released. Well I don't know how to start this review. I can kinda tell you that this is sort of a ""Planet 51"" kinda take. It's different from Planet 51, but only in who goes to the other planet, as in alien goes to earth, instead of human goes to mars deal. Escape from Planet Earth, I never actually thought the movie was ever going to be released, I mean I've heard about it scent's 2010. That's a long time. I thought this movie was going to be shelved, which thankfully it wasn't. The movie was sold off to audiences as an actually funny movie, which according to me and my father (who viewed the movie with me) was a lie. This movie is not that funny. The only thing I found funny was in the trailer which showed the alien voiced by Craig Robinson, eating something and burping, which actually was a deleted scene. Talk about false advertisement. Well anyways let me do the honors by  giving off the problems with the film, they include  the voice cast, jokes, dialog alignment with characters mouths, plot,  product advertisements, and characters.  The voice cast. Wow, I never ever thought I'd criticize a freaking voice cast, but I did have issues with the voice cast, not everyone, just some. I mean everyone works, but I think the voice cast could have been chosen better. Ok, I mean this is something that gets me angry, you have really talented unknown voice actors, who would better perfect the characters but instead you pick up a bunch of random known actors who have NO idea how to voice act, and throw them into the movie. That's what I hate about it. Studios all ways do this. They think it will get people to see the movie, which it will but...... you know what I mean? I have no issues with Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, Steve Zahn, and William Shatner. But it's the random addition of actors like Craig Robinson, George Lopez (who isn't horrible, but could have been replaced), Jane Lynch (yes, I know I loved her in Wreck it Ralph but not in this), and Sofia Vergara. The others are all ok they are not perfect, and could have been replaced but I didn't feel they needed to be mentioned. Craig Robinson, as the alien, named Doc, who is a neat, small little mousey alien. I felt Craig didn't fit the small little, cared, furry ball that Doc, is. And George Lopez, who had previous voice work, could have been replaced as well.  Jane Lynch, while her voice fit in well in ""Wreck it Ralph"", she doesn't sound right as an alien, and it's just comes out  ridicules as alien IO.  And as for Sofia Vergara, she is horrible as the alien love interest to Brendon Fresher's Scorch Supernova. Her voice is so ugly and bland, and uninteresting; it is like ahhh, whenever her character is on screen. This movie, from the trailer looks like a decent funny kid's movie, well it's not funny. At all. I never laughed once, during the movie. The only thing I think anyone would find funny is when the fat guy's towel is  blow off, revealing his doddle and butt. But even that isn't that funny. My dad who watched with uncomfortable eyes kept a straight face threw out the movie, and my dad is the kind of guy who laughs at a lot of stuff. It's sad really. This is new too. I really had trouble  with watching the movie because, the characters lips talked and shut and the dialog would come out right when the mouth is shut, and it's very distracting, and a sign of poor work, from the animators. That was annoying for me.  This plot is a simple, - strong guy gets stuck somewhere, and weaker one has got to save him. It's a basic, kid friendly plot, which isn't always that good. I've seen that plot a million times over before. But little kids will love it. Man! I never thought a movie could feature so much product advertisement! I mean Escape from Planet Earth features a lot of product placement for 7 Eleven.  I mean both aliens, end up landing and going near 7 Eleven and one walks on in and get's a slushy from two alien fanatics. I have no idea what this has to do with the movie but... ok? That was annoying. These characters are one dimensional basically. Almost every character is thinly written out, and has no back story, basically. It makes for a less spectacular journey. Now onto the good things this movie was able to pick up they include, the animation, and Rob Corddry. The animation in this film is beautifully rendered. I mean everything looks beautiful, I mean like the ship, that Scorch travels in at the beginning is beautiful. Everything is so well detailed, it's crazy. I mean the 7 Eleven is well done as well. Even the slurpee used in the film glimmers. The alien planet ""Baab"" looks magnificent! Everything is brightly colored and lit well; it's very cool to look at. That is something kids would enjoy. Lots of eye candy to look at. Very - Very beautiful.  Rob Corddry. Man, that guy, was (for me) an excellent choice for the voice of Scorch Supernova's older, and over shadowed brother Gary Supernova. Rob, put an extra effort into molding Gary's voice, to perfection. Rob Corddry is an actor to lookout for cause he's excellent in almost every role he's in. He's a star to be! His voice is excellent. It adds flesh and tone to the character that is Gary.  All in All, I know that I said a lot of bad things about this movie, but most of it is miner and is over shadowed. This film may be best for little kid's, and was made more to attract money than to attract decent rating, but it's not the worst animated movie out there now a days.

Family-friendly movies are more sparse, and GOOD family movies are a downright rarity. Which has never made much sense to me, since in the cold winter, going to the movies is one of the few (somewhat) affordable things to do with kids. So, we were excited when Escape From Planet Earth came out and we had high hopes that it was going to be a good watch.It was a nice story about two very different but close brothers who have to learn how to be themselves while also letting the other one shine. Anyone who has more than one kid would probably agree that they watch their own children struggle with this quite often, so I liked the message behind the movie.The other positives:the animation is great (but nothing we haven't seen), it's colorful, appropriate for young kids, and has a few laughable scenes sparringly scattered throughout.The not-so positives:It's extremely predictable. Yes, it's a kids movie. But does that mean it has to be a generic kids movie? My kids appreciate something original just as much as I do. Unfortunately, being formulaic means despite its best efforts, it gets pretty boring most of the time. I had to take away my 10 year old's itouch because she kept going on it and my 7 year old son was more entertained by playing with his 3D glasses and the seat. They don't demonstrate poor behavior during movie showings, we go all the time. So when they get this distracted, I know that they're getting just as bored as I am.The movie TRIES to engage parents, even reaching as far as staging a good old fashioned Mommy-War in there... You know, the Stay-At-Home-Mom gets belittled by the Working Mom yet ends up being 10x's smarter and more resourceful, demonstrating that Stay-At-Home moms are worthy of respect.... Oh, yawn. The only people who don't respect Stay-At-Home-Moms or Working Moms are morons, so do we really have to be pandered to like this during a kids movie? Of course, my kids never would have picked up on this, it was just an annoying observation. Had the movie been able to keep us successfully entertained, I would have completely overlooked it.But, apon walking out after he movie was over and asking for reviews, all I got from the kids and their friends was a resounding shoulder shrug and a ""it was okay... Can we go to the arcade now?""And that's what Escape From Planet Earth is: Boring for parents, just okay for kids.",3,On the slower side of okay,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,2453,"['beginning', 'year', 'slow', 'time', 'PG', 'regular', 'movie-going', 'crowd', 'Family-friendly', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'sparse', 'GOOD', 'family', 'movies', 'are', 'downright', 'rarity', 'never', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'cold', 'winter', 'going', 'movies', 'one', 'few', 'somewhat', 'affordable', 'things', 'do', 'kids', 'So', 'were', 'excited', 'when', 'Escape', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'watch.It', 'was', 'nice', 'story', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'close', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'learn', 'how', 'be', 'also', 'letting', 'other', 'one', 'shine', 'Anyone', 'who', 'more', 'one', 'kid', 'would', 'probably', 'agree', 'watch', 'own', 'children', 'struggle', 'quite', 'often', 'liked', 'message', 'movie.The', 'other', 'positives', 'animation', 'great', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'colorful', 'appropriate', 'young', 'kids', 'few', 'laughable', 'scenes', 'sparringly', 'scattered', 'throughout.The', 'not-so', 'positives', 'extremely', 'predictable', 'Yes', 'kids', 'movie', 'mean', 'be', 'generic', 'kids', 'movie', 'kids', 'appreciate', 'something', 'original', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'Unfortunately', 'being', 'formulaic', 'best', 'efforts', 'pretty', 'boring', 'most', 'time', 'had', 'take', 'away', '10', 'year', 'old', 'itouch', 'kept', 'going', '7', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'was', 'more', 'entertained', 'playing', '3D', 'glasses', 'seat', 'do', ""n't"", 'demonstrate', 'poor', 'behavior', 'movie', 'showings', 'go', 'time', 'So', 'when', 'get', 'distracted', 'know', ""'re"", 'getting', 'just', 'as', 'bored', 'am.The', 'movie', 'TRIES', 'engage', 'parents', 'even', 'reaching', 'as', 'far', 'staging', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Mommy-War', 'know', 'Stay-At-Home-Mom', 'belittled', 'Working', 'Mom', 'yet', 'up', 'being', '10x', 'smarter', 'more', 'resourceful', 'demonstrating', 'Stay-At-Home', 'moms', 'are', 'worthy', 'respect', 'Oh', 'yawn', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'respect', 'Stay-At-Home-Moms', 'Working', 'Moms', 'are', 'morons', 'so', 'do', 'really', 'have', 'be', 'pandered', 'like', 'kids', 'movie', 'course', 'kids', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'was', 'just', 'annoying', 'observation', 'Had', 'movie', 'been', 'able', 'keep', 'successfully', 'entertained', 'would', 'have', 'completely', 'overlooked', 'it.But', 'walking', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'asking', 'reviews', 'got', 'kids', 'friends', 'was', 'resounding', 'shoulder', 'shrug', 'was', 'okay', 'Can', 'go', 'arcade', 'now', 'what', 'Escape', 'From', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'Boring', 'parents', 'just', 'okay', 'kids']",N/A

Well it's the over ambition of the younger more popular brother who causes his older and wiser brother (and his alien family) to get in big trouble. Where else? On Earth!Brandon Fraser (The Mummy, Bedazzled) plays the younger and wild brother Scorch Supernova with such flare and arrogance that if you ever had an overly egoistical relative, you'll relate to how obnoxious they can be. Rob Corddry (W., Blades of Glory) plays the older, wiser and less popular brother Gary Supernova who obviously has been putting up with his brothers pushy obnoxiousness all his life.Jonathan Morgan Heit (Date Night, Bedtime Stories) plays Gary's son Kip Supernova and as usual his hearts in the right place but tends to try and help a really bad situation and ends causing a little more trouble than everyone planned on. His kind, smart and definitely strong mother Kira Supernova is played by Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex In The City, Ed Wood). She gets in a few `cat fights' with Lena Thackleman another alien who is the evil henchwoman to the real villain voiced by Jessica Alba (Fantastic Four, Valentine's Day).Now you got to have a bad guy. He has to be in the military. He has to hate aliens and he has to have a world domination goal. Who plays General Shanker of the US Military? Why William Shatner (Star Trek, Boston Legal) himself! I must say he is probably having a great time voicing this role too!Throw in Sofia Vergara (Modern Family) as the alien newswoman Gabby Babblebrock (and love interest for Scorch) and you have a fun space adventure on Earth! Ricky Gervais (The Office, The Invention of Lying) plays a computer wide system that he tends to give some very funny commentary to all things electronic. More than a little sarcasm is dished out, but definitely for some comic relief.There is also a band of good aliens that team up with our heroes like the voices of George Lopez (Valentine's Day, Rio) as slimy alien Thurman and Jane Lynch (Glee, Wreck It Ralph) as the humongous alien Lo. The four of them do some serious bonding and help each other in ways they never expected!I thought this movie was energetic and had some characters that I think everyone can relate to and has a nice strong message of doing the right thing and the strength that is in family and friends.

Few of these efforts can to compare to classics like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, THE LION KING, SHREK or TOY STORY, but every now and then we do get one that is well conceived and entertaining.ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH is definitely well conceived and entertaining.Scorch Supernova (voiced by Brendan Fraser) is the most celebrated space traveler from the planet Baab.  When a distress signal is received from the Dark Planet (also known as ""Earth""), Scorch jumps at the chance to attempt a rescue, even though his brainy brother, Gary (Rob Corddy) warns him that know intergalactic explorer has every returned from that mysterious planet.The distress signal is, indeed, a trap, set by the evil General Shanker (William Shatner) and Scorch falls into it.  Now, only Gary can save him.ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH  features state-of-the-art animation and many laughs, as well as a voice cast that includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Jonathan Morgan Heit, Sofia Vergara and Jessica Alba.  Carl Brunker directed.The 4-disc comb-pack (3D Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, Ultraviolet) from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras: audio commentary by director Brunker, a ""Making of"" featurettes, deleted scenes and music featurettes.ichael B.

1590670,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B009AMAH3O,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[6, 10]","The plot from &#34;Escape from Planet Earth&#34; is pretty much what you would expect from any movie about aliens landing on planet Earth dating back to &#34;E.T. the Extraterrestrial&#34;: Guys in yellow NBC suits (no, not Peacock executives) show up to capture the alien and hilarity ensues. What's so surprising about &#34;Escape&#34; is how it casually embraces Internet conspiracy theory and makes it fodder for a kid's movie.The story begins on Planet Baab (pronounced &#34;Bob&#34;) where blue-skinned national hero Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is like the Buzz Lightyear of BASA (Baab version of NASA, I guess), backed by the Woody equivalent of his planet, head of mission control Gary (Rob Corddry).  Gary's married to a hot wife (yes, this film makes this point twice, although part of the joke is that the blue aliens all look the same to us) named Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker) who was formerly BASA chief before she decided to be a stay-at-home mom to their son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit).  Yes, this comes up too.Scorch's new mission is to visit the Dark Planet, which no alien species has ever returned from.  He is ordered there by the new BASA chief, Lena (Jessica Alba), but it's so dangerous that Gary quits in protest, leaving Scorch on his own. Of course, when Scorch arrives he ends up captured by William T. Shanker (William T. Shatner, hilariously riffing on his Captain Kirk persona), military head of Area 51.  Gary, guilty over quitting and leaving his brother stranded, decides to finally be a hero and try to rescue him.SPOILER FROM PLANET EARTH: He fails miserably.And that's when &#34;Escape&#34; really gets rolling, eagerly embracing all your favorite conspiracy theories: the grays are working for the government, they are creating alien technology, and the government sells back that alien technology to private front corporations which is why we have the touch screens, the Internet, and social networking.  These technologies have been invented by captured aliens diminutive mouse Doc (Craig Robinson), three-eyed slug Thurman (George Lopez), and crab-like giant Io (Jane Lynch).Although the trailers make it look like &#34;Escape&#34; is, well, a buddy-escape movie, it takes quite a long time before any escaping happens.  Mostly, Gary argues with Scorch, Lena and Kira fight, and Shanker makes some glorious Kirk-like speeches.The pacing wildly uneven, ranging from rake-to-the-crotch jokes to awkward interspecies romance.  At one point, a very scary monster is given a voiceover that sounds like someone in the movie theater shouting with a funny voice &#8211; presumably to make the monster less scary in post-production.  There's also the occasional BOING! sound effect that's rather dissonant with the rest of the film's high stakes (Death Star-level planet destroying).The moral of the story seems to be that geeks can fight the power, get the girl, and save the world &#8211; except that Gary pretty much has the first two to begin with.  Still, that's not a bad tale for kids to take away from a film that occasionally veers into adult territory.
