Amazon put it up on Prime and, as i read the description and briefly checked out reviews i vaguely recognized the news story . . . so, i checked it out. This movie was extremely well directed and with a great cast as well. My wife is VERY skiddish when it comes to my taste in movies in the indie and horror scene because i have a high tolerance for the uncomfortable. Even she thought this was worth watching, to a certain degree (i can only speak so much for her; she did finish it at least). It serves a great purpose to show how little we, as a community and culture, truly know about the things at the front of our freedoms. I think the most important idea this film puts forth is . . . QUESTION EVERYTHING. This film is a prime example of why we should be skeptical about authority and about what people claim to be authority.

With his tone of authority the callers convinces the manager and several other employees to violate and humiliate a female employee.Sandra ( Ann Dowd) manages a fast-food chicken joint. Its a busy day and the day has begun with a horrible way- the restaurant just lost a ton of bacon which is is a crucial ingredient for the menu. Sandra then gets a phone call from a man claiming to be police officer Daniels, who tells her that Becky ( Dreama Walker ) has stolen money from a customer.

1600798,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009OCR1OI,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Some things are so bizarre and so out there that they can only be depictions of real life; right.  I mean, you can't make this kind of stuff up.  Reading on Wikipedia on the entirety of this situation and the extent to which it all went down, this movie really only scratches the surface.  Even at that, it is still disturbing.`Compliance' tells the story of Sandra, the manager of a fast food restaurant who gets a call from someone claiming to be a police officer.  The man identifies one of Sandra's employees, young Becky, as a thief and has Sandra contain her in the back until he can get an officer to the restaurant.  He then proceeds to convince Sandra to carry out a search of Becky's belongings and then eventually gets her to do some pretty disturbing things, including a humiliating strip search and eventually this leads to poor Becky being sexually victimized by Sandra's drunken fianc&eacute;e.The fact that all of this really happened, and that it happened more than once (there were many cases of this same impersonator wreaking havoc on fast food restaurants) is unsettling.  Zobel's straightforward direction and knack for atmosphere help propel the film and keep the audience at the edge of their seats.  The central performances by Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker are also outstanding (such layers) and help anchor the film from start to finish.  Dowd is especially great at etching out the insecurities that lurk under Sandra's rough exterior and make her an easy target for the man on the other end.  The way she soaks in his compliments, which makes it all the more easy for her to ignore the warning signs and `do as she's told', just help illuminate us on her plight.  Walker's desperation and eventual compliance are heartbreakingly raw.My issue with `Compliance' comes in the form of its repetitious nature.  It's a short film, and yet it continues to hit the same notes to the point where it feels longer.  When the final ten minutes strike I found myself wishing that it had hit the finale earlier so that it could have been fleshed out further.  It is a rushed finale that doesn't prove to be as satisfying as it could have been.Still, the tone is effective and the ensemble makes the most of their respective roles.  It is a very lived in film, feeling raw and realistic despite the absurdity of this reality.",4,Stranger than fiction...,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2336,"['things', 'are', 'so', 'bizarre', 'so', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'depictions', 'real', 'life', 'right', 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'kind', 'stuff', 'up', 'Reading', 'Wikipedia', 'entirety', 'situation', 'extent', 'went', 'down', 'movie', 'really', 'only', 'surface', 'Even', 'still', 'disturbing.', 'Compliance', 'story', 'Sandra', 'manager', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'who', 'call', 'someone', 'claiming', 'be', 'police', 'officer', 'man', 'one', 'Sandra', 'employees', 'young', 'Becky', 'thief', 'Sandra', 'contain', 'back', 'can', 'get', 'officer', 'restaurant', 'then', 'convince', 'Sandra', 'carry', 'out', 'search', 'Becky', 'belongings', 'then', 'eventually', 'do', 'pretty', 'disturbing', 'things', 'including', 'humiliating', 'strip', 'search', 'eventually', 'poor', 'Becky', 'being', 'sexually', 'victimized', 'Sandra', 'drunken', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'fact', 'really', 'happened', 'happened', 'more', 'once', 'were', 'many', 'cases', 'same', 'impersonator', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'unsettling', 'Zobel', 'straightforward', 'direction', 'knack', 'atmosphere', 'help', 'propel', 'film', 'keep', 'audience', 'edge', 'seats', 'central', 'performances', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'are', 'also', 'outstanding', 'such', 'layers', 'help', 'anchor', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'Dowd', 'especially', 'great', 'etching', 'out', 'insecurities', 'lurk', 'Sandra', 'rough', 'exterior', 'make', 'easy', 'target', 'man', 'other', 'end', 'way', 'compliments', 'more', 'easy', 'ignore', 'warning', 'signs', 'do', 'told', 'just', 'help', 'illuminate', 'plight', 'Walker', 'desperation', 'eventual', 'compliance', 'are', 'heartbreakingly', 'raw.My', 'issue', 'Compliance', 'form', 'repetitious', 'nature', 'short', 'film', 'yet', 'hit', 'same', 'notes', 'point', 'where', 'longer', 'When', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'strike', 'found', 'wishing', 'had', 'hit', 'finale', 'earlier', 'so', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'further', 'rushed', 'finale', ""n't"", 'prove', 'be', 'as', 'satisfying', 'could', 'have', 'been.Still', 'tone', 'effective', 'ensemble', 'most', 'respective', 'roles', 'very', 'lived', 'film', 'feeling', 'raw', 'realistic', 'absurdity', 'reality']",N/A

Yuck. Eww. Give me a break.This movie has no depth. Expect to learn nothing. It's sleazy. It's not Fargo. It's not Nicole Kidman in &#34;To Die For, or Kathleen Turner in &#34;Serial Mom&#34; this movie leaves the viewer feeling disgust. It's not ironic, it's not satire, it's not witty or funny. It's trash.A fast food manager makes her employee strip down naked when a prank caller, posing as a policeman, orders the manager to do so. It gets even worse and more gross. The manager is inspecting the girl's underwear while the assistant manager looks on. This happened in Kentucky at a McDonald.. Many reviewers attest to the fact that this really happened as depicted. I tried watching Anna Nicole Smith's reality show years and years ago. I felt so filthy and degraded by watching I had to stop. This could only happen with morons in charge. Anyone can get pranked. (West Coast, college educated). But the degradation this girl experienced did not need to be in a movie. I stopped watching when I realized the girl was naked and that 75% of the movie still hadn't run. I'm out. I'm done. I skipped to the last five minutes to see how the thing ends.

A review of the movie - the acting was very good in general but, it left something to be desired in the girl. She lacked the emotion that I think she should have had, especially the total ""giving up"" feelings that she should have had at the end that would have made her feel like she had to allow this guy to photograph her crotch with his cell phone and send it to - supposedly, the police, while this guy was staring at her crotch 12 inches away. She never cried once and I find that hard to believe as the movie wore on. Now, my review of the idiocy of the events. There were so many red flags and NOBODY gave a damn. They just went along - except her friend her wanted nothing to do with it and stated so and went back to work. Too bad he didn't look in to see what was going on because he probably would have put a stop to it. Everybody else should have been charged and convicted of assault and whatever else was fitting. For example: The police need to know what her nipples look like? He needs to know what her body looks like? If there was a murder, would the police have someone to send out? There could be money concealed in the clothing, even the panties, that only the police can find because they are trained to find it. Where could a stack of bills be concealed in a tiny pair of panties that no ordinary person could not find? These idiots might have been fooled initially but, it didn't take long for the red flags to show and they just decided - what the hell - and took advantage of the girl. Why? Probably because it was easier than arguing with this guy on the phone.  Why they didn't hang up on him, I don't know. They could have made noise and pretended it was a bad connection - and then the phone goes dead. They also could have said, yeah, her clothes are off, gone along with the jerk, while the girl was fully dressed.  The absurdity of the entire event is beyond belief, except, it really did happen. Oh - and for the supervisor of the restaurant to take all this on herself - I bet she thought she would get a big hero reward for being such a big shot.

However, like many others have already written it was not just inspired by true events, it represents very closely an incident that occurred.  For more information about the incident, wikipedia ""Strip search prank call scam"".It is important that everyone understand what rights they do and not have, because in the end you only have as many rights as you are willing to stand up for.For example, when a police officer stops you and asks to search you or your personal belongings, do you have to consent to such a search?  The answer is: no, but you cannot resist if the officer insists.  What you need to state is simply ""I do not consent to searches"".  If the officer continues to ask you further questions, you also have the right to ask if you are being detained.  This is information that everyone should know and practice, because way too many people just assume that if someone has a badge or a particular uniform that the officer must know what is allowed under the law and what is not allowed under the law.  This is totally incorrect assumption.  Just try engaging in a peaceful protest on public property once or twice in your life and you will see how ill-informed and susceptible law enforcement is to using intimidation, even when dealing with something as basic as the first amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievences (language directly from the first amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America).This whole topic of people's blind willingness to comply with authority is extremely pertinent in an age where many laws have been passed (such as the Patriot Act) that directly contravene the spirit and letter of the US Constitution. People are much too willing to give up liberty for security, however illusionary and fleeting that security may be.I'm not a liberal wacko or a fundamentalist conservative, I'm just an ordinary citizen that is very concerned about how little consideration most US citizens give to their rights and reponsibilities as fellow citizens of a country ruled by a goverment that is supposed to be of the people, for the people, and by the people (which is not part of the wording of the Constitution, in case you are wondering, but rather from the Gettysburg Address).  However, the US Constitution does begin with ""We the people of the United States..."".  This is an inclusionary statement, rather than exclusionary.  If we as citizens don't actively participate in our governance, the goverment is more than happy to do it for us -- to everyone's great detriment.",5,Question authority and know your rights,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",2013,2609,"['movie', 'was', 'very', 'disturbing', 'presentation', 'However', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'already', 'written', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'very', 'closely', 'incident', 'occurred', 'more', 'information', 'incident', 'wikipedia', 'Strip', 'search', 'prank', 'call', 'scam', '.It', 'important', 'everyone', 'understand', 'what', 'rights', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'end', 'only', 'have', 'as', 'many', 'rights', 'are', 'willing', 'stand', 'up', 'for.For', 'example', 'when', 'police', 'officer', 'asks', 'search', 'personal', 'belongings', 'do', 'have', 'consent', 'search', 'answer', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'officer', 'What', 'need', 'state', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'consent', 'searches', 'officer', 'ask', 'further', 'questions', 'also', 'have', 'right', 'ask', 'are', 'being', 'detained', 'information', 'everyone', 'should', 'know', 'practice', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'assume', 'someone', 'badge', 'particular', 'uniform', 'officer', 'must', 'know', 'what', 'allowed', 'law', 'what', 'not', 'allowed', 'law', 'totally', 'incorrect', 'assumption', 'Just', 'try', 'engaging', 'peaceful', 'protest', 'public', 'property', 'once', 'twice', 'life', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'ill-informed', 'susceptible', 'law', 'enforcement', 'using', 'intimidation', 'even', 'when', 'dealing', 'something', 'as', 'basic', 'first', 'amendment', 'right', 'peaceably', 'assemble', 'petition', 'redress', 'grievences', 'language', 'directly', 'first', 'amendment', 'Constitution', 'United', 'States', 'America', '.This', 'whole', 'topic', 'people', 'blind', 'willingness', 'comply', 'authority', 'extremely', 'pertinent', 'age', 'where', 'many', 'laws', 'have', 'been', 'passed', 'such', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'directly', 'spirit', 'letter', 'US', 'Constitution', 'People', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'liberty', 'security', 'however', 'illusionary', 'fleeting', 'security', 'may', 'be.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'liberal', 'wacko', 'fundamentalist', 'conservative', ""'m"", 'just', 'ordinary', 'citizen', 'very', 'concerned', 'how', 'little', 'consideration', 'most', 'US', 'citizens', 'give', 'rights', 'reponsibilities', 'fellow', 'citizens', 'country', 'ruled', 'goverment', 'supposed', 'be', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'not', 'part', 'wording', 'Constitution', 'case', 'are', 'wondering', 'rather', 'Gettysburg', 'Address', 'However', 'US', 'Constitution', 'begin', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'inclusionary', 'statement', 'rather', 'exclusionary', 'citizens', 'do', ""n't"", 'actively', 'participate', 'governance', 'goverment', 'more', 'happy', 'do', 'everyone', 'great', 'detriment']",N/A
1600809,A2582KMXLK2P06,B009OCR1OI,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Some of my review might be considered spoilers if you're not familiar with the story that's supposedly based on actual events.  If you're not familiar with the events, don't read it.  Read my review with caution.I remember when this story happened a few years ago.  Nobody believed it.  A guy pretending to be a cop calls up a fast food restaurant, accuses the cashier lady of stealing money, says he has the proof but he's too busy to go there himself and the other officers are busy searching the girls home, and that she must do whatever he says because if not, she'll have to spend the night in jail.  So the cop eventually makes her take off her clothes so the other employees can search for the money (because you know women have better hiding spots than men).  She gets raped/molested/humiliated throughout the course of the movie, and *then* it's finally over.  Seriously, it had to reach *that* point before common sense kicked in that this was all an elaborate joke?I have to say that pigs jumping over the moon, unicorns dancing over rainbows and the Easter Bunny getting into a fist fight with the Tooth Fairy over Christmas decorations seems more believable than this.  However... apparently this event -despite how impossible it is to believe- really did happen so we have to watch Compliance with the understanding these are real events that actually occurred.To be fair, the cashier girl is only 19 and is presented as an extremely attractive, vulnerable and somewhat clueless girl so perhaps a guy pretending to be a police officer over the phone and forcing her to do whatever he says might seem more believable if you consider the type of girl we're witnessing (unless the REAL victim is significantly different- that I don't know).However I absolutely *refuse* to believe that the store manager, who's at LEAST 30 years older and supposed to have complete common sense in order to keep a fast food restaurant functionable, would believe for one single second that a man on the other end of the phone is actually a cop and, not only that, she'd actually go along with his instructions on removing the cashier girls clothes to retrieve the stolen money.  Come on!  Of course she was reluctant, but she clearly should have realized it's all a big cruel joke.  Even if you're stressed or exhausted, common sense would tell you this is a prank call.  In fact the store manager, Sandra, wasn't even presented as someone who was very stressed.  She just seemed really clueless much like the cashier girl.  The fact she's older makes her actions even more painful to believe.  Older certainly doesn't mean wiser in this case!Even worse, when Sandra brings her husband in not only to keep an eye on the girl who's being kept in the back room away from the customers/employees, HE TOO gives in to the cops outrageous rape-like demands and checks the girl for the location of this ""hidden money"".  By this point if it's not 100%, it should be 110% obvious this is a very deranged prank call because even the cop himself begins to pause and stutter as he runs out of believable words to use.  He even starts laughing!  Didn't Sandra's boyfriend hear the laughs?  Didn't he detect the cops instructions were completely fake?  We've all watched cop shows so we know how they operate, right?Oh right Sandra's boyfriend was drinking again but... 1, that shouldn't matter unless he was flat out drunk because he was clearly sensible/sober enough to understand specific instructions and 2, he definitely didn't appear like he had too many drinks in the movie since he was able to comprehend *all* the instructions given to him.  However the store managers husband *still* goes along with it.  How?  How is this possible?  I personally believe he didn't initially want to touch her, but when he began to grasp the situation and noticed a perfect opportunity to do so, he couldn't refuse.  That's why he ran out of the restaurant without saying goodbye to his girlfriend, Sandra.  Even the other employees who are hard at work eventually realize something suspicious is going on in the back room.  The one employee, Kevin I was believe was his name, knew something was off right from the get go.  He should have stepped up and questioned the cops demands when he had the chance earlier.Seriously?  A cop calling over the phone concerning an important matter over stolen money?  Several hours go by and *still* no police officer has been dispatched to arrive to the restaurant, even though the police station is only, what was it, a half mile away?  Better find a way to show me your badge first, bud.  Still, it all comes back to the store manager not having the sense to realize this was obviously a prank call.  Plain as day.  She should have hung up the phone right away.  No questions.  Don't even give the guy pretending to be a cop a moment to speak for crying out loud!Despite my personal feelings and the impossible-to-believe events that apparently took place here, we can't ignore the fact that as a movie, it was interesting and compelling.  I don't know how much of the film really matches the events, but I assume... make that hoping, that some of the more personal things that occur later on were deliberately exaggerated for movie entertainment purposes.

Words are powerful, and to the ignorant, words are TOOLS used by dark occultists to manipulate your mind. This movie is a demonstration of how mind control works. Hitler said, ""Make the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it."" So ""19 terrorists"" with box cutters brought down THREE buildings, made an impossible dive into the pentagon, and crashed a jet airliner that left no wreckage on 9/11? Well, the TV said so, so I guess it's true. Don't investigate. Don't question. Just accept it. Right. By the end of the movie, the girl is so TRAUMATIZED that she is willing to do anything suggested to her because her mind can't reconcile such an unreality with what is logic and truth. She is compartmentalizing the events in her brain because the brain can't function in any logical way with what is happening to her. Even the lower, most primitive part of the brain (the limbic or reptile brain of ""fight or flight"") is not functioning. She doesn't know from dark or light, right or left, or what color her own eyes are until someone tells her. Her eyes are green but if you told her they were blue, she would agree. Were you traumatized on 9/11? I was. But it only took me a few days to recover and realize that I was being told LIES. I realize that some people won't be able to get this. They are under a deep state of mind control. It's only after turning off the TV for a great length of time before the trance starts to fade and the thin veil of a false reality is lifted. If you follow that with an investigative inquiry into events happening in the world, you will SEE that none of them are what the mind manipulators on TV were telling you. NONE of them.

1600820,A31ATJR2RAVD5G,B009OCR1OI,Christopher Engel,"[2, 7]","A real story or not, this story is more meant to be a dark comedy than an actual drama, because the two main characters are borderline mentally disabled. So let's summarize the depth of the movie in its entirety here:""An unbelievably dumb and naive pair of women listen to someone who simply claims to be a police officer. Over the phone. Yes, over the phone. They believe every word he says and do everything he says, no matter how blatantly outrageous and in every way would never even be close to reasonable for anyone, because hey, he says he's a cop. Which makes absolutely no sense to anyone.""Seriously, the plot ends right where it begins. A police officer explains something over the phone and that he needs her ""help"". He feeds her enough BS ""Call me officer!"" and ""Don't tell anyone!"" that's fit more for a Crank Yankers routine than a freaking drama.Pro tip for common sense: Cops don't call over the phone asking a civilian to do a single thing he asks. He isn't present, and thus can't prove he's a cop. He also isn't present for something this allegedly ""major"" trouble Rebecca is in. So, uh, the guy's apparently a good prank caller, and these two women never, at any point in the entire ordeal, ask the obvious question, ""Can you prove this isn't a prank call?"" This has never been done before in the history of anything, ever. Everything this ""officer"" claims is totally unprovable and wildly not-cop-like.Not that any of that matters at all. The second the caller says he's an officer is when the conversation would end. That's it. That's the end of the tension. The police don't operate by proxy, because they're apparently too busy to deal with this ""serious situation"" with even one police officer. It makes absolutely no difference what he says. He can say whatever he wants. But unless he's there, *NO ONE* is obligated to a single thing until he shows up.So, hey, if you're dumb enough to fall for one of the oldest prank calls ever done by anyone (Do you think this is the first time someone's pranked someone by claiming to be an officer and asking for equally astonishingly outrageous things?), you deserve to go through all this, because you'd need to be naive and ignorant on a level so supernatural to not even think that NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.You don't need to be an expert on the police, or even have experience with the police, to have the thought, ""Hey, is there some reason no one's come here themselves to question her, and the 'backup'--apparently because you can't be too careful when raiding a fast-food joint for a freaking teenage girl on the job who is the least threatening person, ever, of all time--didn't just come here first?""It's not like she had any intentions of fleeing the country. The ""officer"" claims to have surveillance footage of some sort perfectly describing Rebecca. Rebecca obviously has no intention of leaving whatsoever.Whether or not this was based on a true story and how accurate it is, this is a freaking comedy posing as a serious drama. Every character here is stupid. I know movie characters are often stupid, but this doesn't just cross the line of total ignorance, it's obviously absurd. No one, not one person, not even Kevin--the single character who initially appears to have a working brain--questions the incredible and stunningly obvious absurdity of the situation.This is a movie that, like cheap horror flicks, relies on incredibly stupid characters who can't even think as far ahead as to realize anyone can say they're an officer. Every single person buys it. Everyone, 100%, no questions asked. When even someone with the intelligence of a teenager might think to ask, ""How do you know this guy's a cop by talking over the phone? And do you seriously think anyone's been asked to do any of this in the history of 'police procedure'?"" How far gone do you have to be to not even *question* this?Maybe if they even had a single scene of someone questioning this guy, that *might* make it a little more acceptable. But there is no bump in the transition of ""I'm an officer, fetch the one who's an alleged thief. Be sure to tell everyone about it who isn't involved in the slightest, nor are they required to be involved at any point (guess what, the police do their own work!), and I'm officer Daniels, that's all you will know about me, you can hand the phone to anyone because I realize everyone's this insane, you can do strip searches over the FREAKING PHONE, and my only problem is that I can't get any officers there to actually do anything, so why don't you do these things that you aren't even allowed to do, even if an 'officer' tells you to do it?""Unbelievable. But not unbelievable in the entertaining way, just in the, ""You can't be serious. This is the plot? That's it? This is how it starts and continues on as more and more people get involved, and I get much more hostile and threatening than any officer would *EVER* be?""I'll tell you what happens when I get a call about something this ridiculous, and believe me, it's relatively common for almost any place. If it's profit-oriented (such as, ""Our network says your computer's infected. Here's what you need to do...OR ELSE."" it's typically aimed toward senior citizens, and not someone like me, who works (not to their knowledge) in medical data security. I take the call, act involved, and try to trace the source (and not with movie equipment that takes 30 seconds flat, just a little something called caller ID that, um, works instantaneously when the call arrives. Sometimes these schemes are so short-sighted, they don't even bother with a private number), and then report it to the police. That's how it works.I can't say I've ever been called by someone claiming to be an officer. But I really don't think I need to, since I've been called by people who aren't who they claim to be all the time. But I know one thing, and one thing that seems obvious: The police doesn't phone in their arrests. In fact, if anything, a real officer would tell you to stay the hell out of it if they aren't present, and simply wait until they arrive. You, yourself, are *their* problem, not the other way around, short of being the victim in an armed home invasion, in which case they tell you, if possible, to hide, or if that's not possible, to do every single thing the other party tells you. Because that's how it's always worked in the history of everything. If someone calls claiming to be an officer, guess what? You tell the real police about it. That's common sense. I like to think most people have it to some reasonable extent.But uh, sorry, cops don't do arrests--much less convictions--over the freaking phone. Get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew, this film goes up there as ""one of the worst films ever made"", without question. It has no right to be taken seriously by anyone, and the very presumption that it should is insulting. Total trash.I'm glad I watched this for free on Prime, because the plot interested me. Unfortunately, it was written totally incompetently, and directed even worse.

1600821,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B009OCR1OI,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[2, 2]","When people walk out of a film before its conclusion, it is almost always due to graphic sex or violence. The controversial 2012 drama ""Compliance"" has neither and yet, many headed for the exits during its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. That tells me the film touched an exposed nerve documenting a side of human nature too much to bear. ""Compliance"" is a well-made character study based almost verbatim on a true story.For almost a decade, a security guard creep prank-called fast-food restaurants impersonating a police officer. He would tell the manager a young female employee had stolen from a customer. Police were busy searching the suspect's home and needed the manager's assistance to strip search the employee in a back room for evidence. ""We'll send an officer over soon and we appreciate your cooperation."" That almost 70 managers followed these ""orders"" is unbelievable. But they did. None more so than a female manager of a McDonald's in small-town Kentucky.The incident, well-documented by ABC News' ""20/20,"" escalated for almost three hours until a person guarding the young suspect, instructed by the authoritative caller per his instructions, sexually assaulted her. If it were not true, I could barely believe it.The strength of ""Compliance"" is that every viewer will ask themselves, ""What would I have done in the same situation?"" There are several factors at play in the case and film. Foremost is the soul-sucking grind of working in a fast-food dive. For anyone who has had to produce huge amounts of daily work, they are familiar with the mind-set of falling in line, moving on to the next project without thought. You're trying to reach the end of an exhausting day on a job you have not the slightest interest in doing. Dealing with the nuisance of a policeman on the phone is a distraction to the necessary labor -- just keep pace and provide customer demand. And so, you follow orders without thought because for years, the grind has conditioned you to do so.I suppose we could question the intellect of a typical fast-food employee (though the reality is the job itself renders all souls identical, no matter the intellect). But let's go a step further. What about the sexual politics between the middle-aged female manager Sandra (Ann Dowd), frumpy and past her prime, and the young teenage woman Becky (Dreama Walker) with multiple men pursuing her? When presented with an opportunity to humiliate, was it not something the manager subconsciously relished? Are we not all driven by the urge to best a rival?Writer and director Craig Zobel has hinted at all of the above with subtle strokes. In an extraordinary tracking shot, he follows Sandra to her car as she is carrying Becky's clothes completely compliant with the prank caller. Does she even consider the situation, or is her life so powerless she no longer perceives? Dowd gives a wonderful performance in the difficult role of Sandra, a woman suffering from great stress. Someone left the refrigerator open, $1,500 of food has spoiled, and they are short on bacon and pickles. It's a busy night and she's afraid of losing her job.I was reminded of the famous 1960's Milgram experiments (Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View (Perennial Classics)), where subjects at Yale University were asked by a ""doctor"" to give increasingly large doses of electrical shocks to students who gave incorrect answers. It didn't matter students screamed from the next room they were in terrible pain. Almost 70 percent of the time, subjects pressed the button to induce electrical shock following the doctor's orders. Now the entire experiment was fabricated and no one was hurt, with the exception of traumatized subjects in need of serious therapy after being exposed to their darker tendencies (Behind the Shock Machine: The Untold Story of the Notorious Milgram Psychology Experiments). The experiment -- as immoral as an experiment could possibly be -- serves as troubling evidence as to the many German soldiers who ""followed orders"" from authority figures when killing hundreds of thousands of humans in the concentration camps.Certainly ""Compliance"" is a microcosm of such disturbing human nature, an unintentional social psychology experiment where numerous souls ensnared within the endless American wasteland of plastic fast-food cathedrals (Fast Food, Fast Talk: Service Work and the Routinization of Everyday Life) follow orders to the point of destroying lives and careers.The conclusion of ""Compliance"" is weak, lacking poetic grace, and revealing the prank caller halfway in robs later scenes of tension. But it is a profoundly disturbing work that refuses to coddle American audiences. For a film as quiet as ""Compliance"" to cause people to leave the theater in disgust means a chord has been struck. For that reason alone, it is a tremendous success.",4,Is our life so powerless?,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,4855,"['When', 'people', 'walk', 'film', 'conclusion', 'almost', 'always', 'due',

She's the kind who can't deviate from the book and is so enamored of authority she does everything they demand of her unquestioningly.  Becky(Dreama Walker) is the antithesis of everything Sandra beholds.  A counter girl at the fast food restaurant they both work at Becky is beautiful, bright, and perky. You can see Sandra quietly seethe everytime she walks past her.  It's like revisiting high school with Sandra the outsider and Becky the popular girl.  When a phone call to the restaurant comes in identifying himself as ""Officer Daniels""(Pat Healy) who says that Becky has stolen from a customer and must be detained until the police get there Sandra unhesitatingly complies and takes Becky to a storage room.  With the good officer still on the line he gives Sandra outrageous instructions that she is more than willing to abide by. In the process Becky is humiliated by a series of violations both mental and physical culminating in a sexual assault on her person by Sandra's dopy boyfriend(Bill Camp).  Any number of questions cross your mind during the course of the film.  Primarily you wonder why Sandra doesn't ask for credentials or at least question Daniels' unorthodox requests.  Why doesn't Becky resist? The only logical reason you can think  is her resistance is so beaten down that she has no choice but to go with the program.  And why is Sandra's boyfriend on the scene at all?  Amazingly this all takes place with dozens of people in the building.  Daniels is the worst kind of evil.  He's the kind who casually makes a sandwich while totally debasing another human just for the fun of it.  You can only return to the old response the citizens under the Third Reich used to give that they were only following orders.  ""Compliance"" is a provocative film without being exploitative.

The very fact that this film has generated so much controversy and made people stop to wonder ""What would _I_ have done?"" says a great deal in its favor.Yes, you would think that someone would eventually get the bright idea to at least call the local police or the restaurant's district manager to verify that ""Officer Daniels"" is for real, especially when his directions become entirely perverse. COMPLIANCE is another reminder of the old saw that truth is stranger than fiction: This story would be absolutely ludicrous if it were NOT closely based on actual events.Pros:--Good script and acting, especially by Dowd, Walker,and Philip Ettinger. Their tones of voice, postures, and facial expressions are captured very well. These actors act and react just as people would under these circumstances.--Pretty gripping storyline, and the admonitory message of the film is not so heavy-handed that it destroys the tension and basic watchability.--The irony of how young, unreliable Kevin and Harold the simple-minded janitor are the only ones to immediately see the absurdity of the situation-- while the more ""responsible"" adults just do as they're told--is not lost.--No prolonged views of Becky during the strip-search. While this omission may disappoint some folks, gratuitous nudity would have completely killed the film's integrity.Cons:--As stated, the whole story is compelling, but at the same time, COMPLIANCE has that patchy flavor that so many low budget Indies have.

Performances are good, mostly, though there are many, many moments that were unconvincing (at least to me); and the script made use of its central conceit - a telephone call from a faceless voice alleging to be a police officer who spends, literally, an entire workday directing people to do things that are clear violations of the law - for far too long for it to be remotely credible.

And, yes, I mean REALLY stupid.  Capital `S' stupid.  Feloniously stupid.Then, imagine someone made a film about it.See, what happens when you make a small or big budget picture about something so grievously wrong is that you end up glamorizing it by the very nature of finding the story fit for the telling and retelling.  You give it more credence than what it deserves by crafting a narrative, in securing finances, by hiring actors and technicians and an entire crew, and capturing such inane stupidity in bold, imaginative colors.  You bring it to life in a way that transcends the trivial - why, after all, would you WANT to bring this story to life since, statistically, this occurrence establishing itself as a norm is beyond comprehension?Well, the only answer to that I can give is that you want to deliver a message.If the message is benign and not meant to indirectly satirize or even lampoon the folks involved, then I'd imagine that your message is intending to educate others about the perils of this happening to them.  That, in itself, is a good message ... but, if that's the case, why wouldn't you say as much in the narrative?  If the message is, let's say, one of indifference, that you don't have a clear message, and you only wanted to pose the circumstances and then have folks ""discuss it,"" then again it's mostly benign, but what guarantee would you make your investors?  ""Here, I want to make this picture just to get the audience talking because the more they talk the more money you can make back on your investment.""  That certainly wouldn't inspire me to give money to such a project.  Lastly, if your message is one of indirect harm - one meaning to exploit a tragedy and indirectly denigrate the stunning number of knuckleheads a pathological liar managed to implicate - should you be allowed to make such a picture?  Isn't that `libel,' of a sort?Because so much of COMPLIANCE ends up glorifying the actions of the charlatan who got the ball in this story rolling, then, sadly, I'm only left with the impression that Zobel intended to exploit a tragedy for material gain, meaning ""a hit film.""I'd encourage you to Google how poorly the film was received at Sundance, how the audience there were treated by Zobel (keep in mind I wasn't there so I'm only communicating second-hand impressions), and then sit back and think about what you just watched.  Think about all of the filmmakers who've engaged audiences for years - decades, in fact - and then think about how Zobel greeted what sounded like an unsupportive audience: ""I don't like to say people are stupid, so the film for me was retroactively saying, 'What part of human nature lets this happen?'""  When you glorify violence against women - young, old, large, small, and there are plenty of victims in this picture - do you think you should proactively respond by indicting possibly your audience?If you want to know more about COMPLIANCE, then check out the other reviews.  Others will gladly and graciously cover the plot, give kudos to the cast and crew, tell you the highs and lows, etc.  Occasionally, I'd rather know how someone felt about the film, and it didn't make me feel good.  Not about myself but about those who made it.  Call me a prude, if you like.  I've been called worse.COMPLIANCE is produced by Bad Cop Bad Cop Film Productions, Dogfish Pictures, and Muskat Filmed Properties.  DVD distribution is being handled through Magnolia Pictures.  As for the technical aspects, the production looks and sounds solid.  This isn't a bright film (stylistically), and it isn't meant to be.  It's necessary drenched in dark colors.  There's nothing kid-friendly about it, and you probably don't want to watch it as a date movie, that's for sure.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  While I think there's something of value in any motion picture, I'm hard pressed to give COMPLIANCE a full recommendation.  Certainly, human resources and training professionals might find greater value in the film than the lay person (and I say this as someone who has worked in H.R.).  Otherwise, there's so much that happened here that just defies belief.  Yes, I know it was based on a true story, and, yes, the film cites that over seventy similar incidents are on record, but seventy incidents compared to the entire population of the world means the probability of it being a `phenomenon' is ridiculously rare.  Instead, I'd imagine that writer/director Zobel and much of the Hollywood Left delight at glamorizing yet one more time how stupid Americans can be misled to do horrifically stupid things.Oh, yeah ...

It' s a busy, short-handed, Friday night at a fast food chicken joint in Ohio. The manager gets a call from a policeman saying he is with a woman who says one of the employees (Becky) of the place stole money out of her purse. He cannot spare an officer to get there so he asks the manager to help in the investigation. Through a combination of flattery and mild threats he gets the manager, and a few others, to take Becky through a series of humiliating, and patently illegal, procedures to get to the bottom of things.I wanted to like this. And I know of some of the experiments that have been conducted that show how people will bend to authority, but I just didn't believe this. The caller was lucky in that the manager with whom he was dealing was real milquetoast. I'd like to think that someone with more spine wouldn't have caved so easily. As a matter of fact, there is only one young guy who smells something fishy and an old fix-it guy who knows something is wrong and refuses to comply. Everyone else involved towed the line. There was one defining moment, when the caller asks a particular question of the manager's boyfriend who is lending a hand, that should have thrown up red flags the size of Texas, but he proceeded to do as he was told.This all looks very natural. The actors do a decent job and the viewer feels as though he's in on an actual event. The fast food joint setting looks as it should. The opening shots show various things that are in disrepair. Things, like our society, that are breaking down, so it's a cautionary tale to be sure. And the post script says this was one of 70 similar events that took place around the country. They allude to the fact that this one caller may have perpetrated all 70 events. But this needed a better script. I'm not saying this isn't plausible.

1600842,A17GJLWZSMHIAT,B009OCR1OI,"glen ""randomglen""","[1, 2]","Phone prank gets a movie, and not just a movie but an involved, deep and well made movie. I can see why ""Compliance"" gets mixed reviews with many saying they shut it off early because I almost did turn it off also. The movie starts out dumb witted about teens at a fast food joint. But I recognized the blonde gal.. yes that is Dreama Walker from the failed TV sitcom. ""B In Apt 23"". So I kept watching because of her. Does she have any acting chops I wanted to know. But even with her I really felt like turning this off. This is such an odd movie, which pushes one's patience and critical judgments. First act fooled me into thinking this is a poorly written, badly acted exercise of some sort of public service announcement about tragic `true events'. But what really turned me off was the annoying supervisor whom I didn't like from the offset and throughout (Ann Dowd). But my stop button finger never hit stop I think because this movie kept teasing me. ""We need to strip search Ms. Walker"" Huh? Really? So I kept watching. And kept watching I did with my eyes in wonder at how far this goes and rewarded with something I was not expecting from the start. A multi-faceted, really well acted, intense indie art film.I think while watching this, and resigning myself to keep watching this after some debate, it's hard not to notice the nervy lack of logic of the script. Why are these people doing this? What are the motivations? Why such trust in this caller who said he is the police that is making a mockery of these people and keeps making a mockery of them. There is a disconnect of the question of 'why' that is distracting and does amount to the question of trust one would have in this movie. I started to not care about these people because they are being so stupid. However there is a big kicker to all this. My wavering trust, my logic in general gets put aside as I choose to give in, suspend my disbelief. Once I do a funny thing happens which is not unlike Dreama Walker's character. I resign myself to this world. Once the end credits start rolling I realize that I may have just seen an important film, acted by strong actors, directed my someone who just hoodwinked me and really did know what he was doing all along. My initial disbelief turned. I started to appreciate the makers of this film and saw it as a process of remarkable success in the details. I was educated about real events of this movie was based, but I don't think that is the true message of this movie. The PSA aspect of this movie is really a side player to the craft of filmmaking and acting. Dreama Walker herself and her character becomes such a intermediate role of this film. She is the epicenter of a multi-layered circle which turns her into a object of desire by many. Will she really take her top off I asked. I had to keep watching to find out...Usually in great acting roles, you may know the actor from other films but he or she is so good at acting they make you forget about previous roles and convince you they are the person they are, in any role. In `Compliance', the opposite happens with Dreama Walker. This is not a knock on her acting, but the more this movie progressed it stopped being about her character and more about the actual actor and real person. Dreama (spoiler alert) really does strip and stands there naked (for the most part). A real director and film crew really is recording her with a real camera. There really was, much like the plot of the script, negotiations of how far Dreama will go, how much will she take off. It was at some point during pre-productions contracted with Dreama herself. As Dreama's character is de-humanized she too must feel that vulnerability. Because not only is the director, film crew and actors gazing at her so am I.  Dreama becomes a object of beauty to gawk at by the other characters in the plot and the audience. Dreama's beauty becomes centrist to all involved. (As a side note: Dreama has a natural beauty on many levels but her hair is remarkable. A truly beautiful long mane of blonde locks.)So I got suckered, teased into watching this, but feel rewarded at the end by a film that folds onto itself. The PSA aspect gets lost until there is a 5 second factoid at the very end about how many times this prank has really happened. I suppose there is something to learn about the truism of this odd crime. You couldn't make this film as pure fiction, but for me the PSA aspect is not the whole motivation. This is a tricky film on many levels. Dreama is the center but oddly it's not only her that makes it succeed, it's the actors around her that do. There is so many points that this movie could have failed. This film is depended on good acting. It's tricky because the first half is written kinda lame brain about stupid teens at a stupid fast food joint ran by stupid people.  It's actually written poorly and I mean written poorly ON PURPOSE. This is important, I think a rouse to make you think this is a poorly written movie not worth your attention but the opposite is true.Ann Dowd who plays a restaurant supervisor is annoying from the beginning. I didn't like her, or her logic. Thought she was just stupid in intelligence. If you can get over this and make it to the end, you realize her character she is playing really is annoying and stupid. Most importantly Ann Down's character is culpable to the crime, along with her no good creepy husband. Who are these people? Was this a scam for them just to see Dreama in the buff? Is this entire movie a scam to get Dreama in the buff? I think these things only because these roles by Dreama and those around her are so well acted. There is a balancing act going on between the crime and the motivation and the actors played this tricky stuff really well inside a directors vision..It's not Ann Down who is stupid; it's her character that is and she convinces us of her stupidity through good acting skill. But there is a real movie being made before your eyes, an artistic craft by all involved, a risky endeavor by Dreama who puts her career on the line.Overall the more I think about the difficulties of this movie, the nudity of Dreama, the supporting actors, the tricky script, the directors vision and pulling it all together, the more I think this is a important film, and a art film at that. I understand people turning this movie off, I almost did myself, but the criticisms of poor acting are way off. Look deeper and you will find a lot more here of depth and accomplishment on many levels.. It's a parallel reaction, as Dreama's character becomes resigned by the circumstances so too the viewer is. Once some logic is suspended, like by the characters themselves, it's revealed a very well made movie. As I said earlier of my review, this is not so much an exercise in storytelling, rather of filmmaking and the art of acting.",5,"It's not what is seems, or is it?",1375833600,"08 7,

1600843,A3LEVA2HQW2CKF,B009OCR1OI,HD Eyes,"[0, 3]","By far the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen, yet, I don't know why I liked it so much? All I did is yell at the screen throughout the entire movie. I couldn't believe how stupid people could really be. With that being said, the acting was incredible, especially by Ann Dowd, who plays the ditzy, not so smart restaraunt manager. Her character, although the dumbest woman on the planet, is so believable that  her performance just sinks you into this indie flick. I once worked in retail, and to be honest, I knew of another manager who was just like her. So, could someone possibly have been fooled by a voice over the telephone pretending to be the police? I think the answer is, Yes. You never know how one might react in this kind of circumstance; however, I think the movie takes it just a little too far. Just when you think it's bad...it only gets worse. One of the final scenes with Sandra's (Ann Dowds) boyfriend, and Becky (the victim), is so unimaginable and sickening, which made me think, maybe Becky likes it? I know it's sick, but, maybe she isn't such a sweet, nice girl? Why else would she agree to all of this? All in all, the movie hit a core with me, which is why I am talking about it. It says that it is based on True Events, and in the end it says that it had happened over 70 times in the U.S. However, it appears that these characters in this movie are not based on real people. The movie also leaves you with some questions that I would have liked answered. Like, what became of Becky and Sandra? There were many times I wanted to shut the movie off, however, before I knew it, the movie just flew by and was over. The only question that bothers me the most is... if an officer is calling and saying that they have reason to believe that an employee has stolen money from a custmoer then why didn't she just play back the resturaunts surveillance video from the begining to see if she took the money? I would have. But I guess there wouldn't be a movie then. Anyway, with that being said, you know that Sandra isn't the most sane person from the very begining of the movie. You know that she has a lot on her plate. And you know that she is trying to be the perfect citizen. She is really trying hard to please this officer on the other line, and doesn't even question that what she is doing is wrong. The restaraunt is busy and she can't really juggle two things at once, so she gets others to do it for her. Walking away from this movie I said two things. The first, I hated this movie! How stupid can people be! The second thing was, Ann Dowd deserves an Oscar! Now, a day later and although I feel the same about Ann Dowd, I think looking back, that I kinda' liked the movie a little bit more then I first thought.",4,Ann Dowd deserves Oscar!,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,2754,"['far', 'most', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'did', 'yell', 'screen', 'entire', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'could', 'really', 'be', 'being', 'said', 'acting', 'was', 'incredible', 'especially', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'who', 'ditzy', 'not', 'so', 'smart', 'restaraunt', 'manager', 'character', 'dumbest', 'woman', 'planet', 'so', 'believable', 'performance', 'just', 'sinks', 'indie', 'flick', 'once', 'worked', 'retail', 'be', 'honest', 'knew', 'manager', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'So', 'could', 'someone', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'fooled', 'voice', 'telephone', 'pretending', 'be', 'police', 'think', 'answer', 'Yes', 'never', 'know', 'how', 'one', 'might', 'react', 'kind', 'circumstance', 'however', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'bad', 'only', 'worse', 'One', 'final', 'scenes', 'Sandra', 'Ann', 'Dowds', 'boyfriend', 'Becky', 'victim', 'so', 'unimaginable', 'sickening', 'made', 'think', 'maybe', 'Becky', 'know', 'sick', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'such', 'sweet', 'nice', 'girl', 'Why', 'else', 'would', 'agree', 'movie', 'hit', 'core', 'why', 'am', 'talking', 'based', 'True', 'Events', 'end', 'had', 'happened', '70', 'times', 'U.S', 'However', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'movie', 'also', 'questions', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'answered', 'what', 'became', 'Becky', 'Sandra', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'wanted', 'shut', 'movie', 'off', 'however', 'knew', 'movie', 'just', 'flew', 'was', 'over', 'only', 'question', 'bothers', 'most', 'officer', 'calling', 'saying', 'have', 'reason', 'believe', 'employee', 'stolen', 'money', 'custmoer', 'then', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'play', 'back', 'resturaunts', 'surveillance', 'video', 'begining', 'see', 'took', 'money', 'would', 'have', 'guess', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'then', 'Anyway', 'being', 'said', 'know', 'Sandra', ""n't"", 'most', 'sane', 'person', 'very', 'begining', 'movie', 'know', 'lot', 'plate', 'know', 'trying', 'be', 'perfect', 'citizen', 'really', 'trying', 'hard', 'please', 'officer', 'other', 'line', ""n't"", 'even', 'question', 'what', 'doing', 'wrong', 'restaraunt', 'busy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'juggle', 'two', 'things', 'once', 'others', 'do', 'Walking', 'away', 'movie', 'said', 'two', 'things', 'first', 'hated', 'movie', 'How', 'stupid', 'can', 'people', 'be', 'second', 'thing', 'was', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'Oscar', 'Now', 'day', 'later', 'feel', 'same', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'think', 'looking', 'back', 'kinda', 'liked', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'then', 'first', 'thought']",N/A

Today article on the truth behind this movie and the journalist stated that the crime was accurately depicted- except for the portrayal of the victim. The article said that the young girl involved in the story was, in real life, crying and protesting her treatment throughout the incident. If the film had portrayed her this way, I don't believe many people could have endured the entire thing. As it is, it is hard to watch.If you are going to watch this film you should be prepared to be frustrated and angry with the people who willingly went along with this malicious prank - and in the process, became worse than the perpetrator himself. I've heard of people drinking lemon detergent or drying their kittens in the microwave but this is a documented incident of truly incredible human stupidity and there were others like it in several states.The film is subtly photographed in a style that helps set the tone of the story. The director keeps the viewer in squeamish suspense wondering ""How far will this go?"" and ""Where is the voice of reason?""(thank god an actual voice of reason does eventually arrive)....The truly hard questions come AFTER the film, when you will ask ""How could my fellow human beings be so stupid and cold hearted?"" or worse, ""Is ANYONE capable of such willing moral blindness?""This was a simple and provocative piece - well acted, directed, and produced.

I remember hearing news accounts of the story of a Kentucky McDonald's manager who strip-searched a female employee at the behest of a prank caller who claimed to be a police officer investigating a theft by the employee. Prior to watching the movie, I did some googling to refresh my memory. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** At least three other employees were present at various points during the more than three hours long ordeal. The prank caller even got the manager's fiance involved, encouraging him to spank and sexually assault the employee. Shockingly, the fiance went along with the requests with little resistance. ***END SPOILERS***All of these disgusting events are portrayed in the film. It's impossible to understand how not one person stepped in to help Becky, played by Dreama Walker from the TV show, ""Don't Trust the B in Apartment 23."" It's also hard not to ask why Becky did not march out of the restaurant. Even the prank caller, who starts off as just an anonymous voice on the phone, but is eventually shown puttering around his house during the call, chuckles in disbelief at various times as the situation continues to spiral out of control.Ann Dowd does a marvelous job as the store manager, Sandra. She is sympathetic towards Becky, but she is eager to obey authority, and the conflict shows. At the same time, she was the one with the most ability, just by virtue of her position, to bring the whole thing to a halt, and she chose not to.This movie is very difficult to watch, particularly because we know it was based on an actual event. I would not go so far as to say this is a study of human behavior, because I believe there are very few people who would actually fall victim to this sort of crime. Indeed, we learn that there were many similar prank calls attempted, possibly by the same perpetrator, but none went as far as the Kentucky McDonald's one did. Instead, it is a depiction of one very uniquely subservient group of people who were unlucky enough to become the random targets of a twisted individual.",4,"""Let's just get this over with.""",1358640000,"01 20, 2013",2013,2169,"['Even', 'most', 'twisted', 'demented', 'screenwriter', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'story', 'Compliance', 'had', 'not', 'actually', 'happened', 'remember', 'hearing', 'news', 'accounts', 'story', 'Kentucky', 'McDonald', 'manager', 'who', 'strip-searched', 'female', 'employee', 'behest', 'prank', 'caller', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'police', 'officer', 'investigating', 'theft', 'employee', 'Prior', 'watching', 'movie', 'did', 'googling', 'refresh', 'memory', '***POSSIBLE', 'SPOILERS***', 'least', 'three', 'other', 'employees', 'were', 'present', 'various', 'points', 'more', 'three', 'hours', 'long', 'ordeal', 'prank', 'caller', 'even', 'got', 'manager', 'fiance', 'involved', 'encouraging', 'spank', 'sexually', 'assault', 'employee', 'Shockingly', 'fiance', 'went', 'requests', 'little', 'resistance', '***END', 'SPOILERS***All', 'disgusting', 'events', 'are', 'portrayed', 'film', 'impossible', 'understand', 'how', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'stepped', 'help', 'Becky', 'played', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'TV', 'show', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Trust', 'B', 'Apartment', '23', 'also', 'hard', 'not', 'ask', 'why', 'Becky', 'did', 'not', 'march', 'restaurant', 'Even', 'prank', 'caller', 'who', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'anonymous', 'voice', 'phone', 'eventually', 'shown', 'puttering', 'house', 'call', 'chuckles', 'disbelief', 'various', 'times', 'situation', 'spiral', 'control.Ann', 'Dowd', 'marvelous', 'job', 'store', 'manager', 'Sandra', 'sympathetic', 'towards', 'Becky', 'eager', 'obey', 'authority', 'conflict', 'same', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'ability', 'just', 'virtue', 'position', 'bring', 'whole', 'thing', 'halt', 'chose', 'not', 'to.This', 'movie', 'very', 'difficult', 'watch', 'particularly', 'know', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'event', 'would', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'study', 'human', 'behavior', 'believe', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'actually', 'fall', 'victim', 'sort', 'crime', 'Indeed', 'learn', 'were', 'many', 'similar', 'prank', 'calls', 'attempted', 'possibly', 'same', 'perpetrator', 'none', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'Kentucky', 'McDonald', 'one', 'did', 'Instead', 'depiction', 'one', 'very', 'uniquely', 'subservient', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'unlucky', 'enough', 'become', 'random', 'targets', 'twisted', 'individual']",N/A

It's an unrelenting piece of film-making that knows its truthfulness is going to make it unpopular as the audience is forced to watch a small scale atrocity unfold. It's a blend of the Milgram and Stanford prison experiments and has a factual basis in a strip search prank call that occurred over 70 times throughout the US, and in the way it's depicted here, it's perfectly believable and doesn't seem contrived at all.The two principal actors are great at maintaining the suspense despite having to carry almost the entire film by themselves.

Instead of Ohio, it took place in Mount Washington, Kentucky at a prominent fast-food restaurant chain in 2004.A man called the restaurant, claiming to be a police officer. He tells the manager that one of her young female employees has taken money out of the purse of a customer.Sandra, the manager, brings Becky, the employee into a back room, and per the policeman's instructions has her turn her pockets inside out and goes through her purse. She finds nothing. The officer says she can either wait until a squad car arrives or strip search the employee. The fast-food place is very busy so all agree to the strip search. Again nothing is found.The officer instructs the manager to put Becky's clothes in her unlocked vehicle and keep her in the back until officers arrive.The humilated Becky covers herself with an apron.

1600855,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B009OCR1OI,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[5, 9]","Have you ever gotten a prank call at home or work? Did they pretend to be some kind of authoritative person? A superior where your work or the police, and if they told you to do something did you do it. That is essentially what is going on in Compliance except it delves deeper into the darker side of human nature. What I and many people probably won't before seeing this movie is it is very closely based on a true story. It happened only a few years ago. As most of you know there are obviously scammers and prank callers operating all the time. Well in the mid-1990's to 2004 there was a prank calling, calling restaurants, fast food restaurants and grocery stores in rural parts of the country claiming to be a detective for the police. The man then convinces managers or whoever in charge to commit acts, like forcing female employee's to strip and do strip searches, confining them and other things. The incident the film is based on and the one that got the prank caller arrested happened in 2004 in Mount Washington, Kentucky at a McDonald's. The caller who is a man called the McDonald's during the night shift and got the assistant manager Donna Summers. He managed to convince her he was a detective with the police. He then told her that one of her female employee's is believed to have stolen money. He describes what Donna believes is Louise Ogborn one of the employee's on duty. The man says there are no officer's available to come out and needed her help. During the night Donna would confine Louise, take her car keys and wallet, force her to strip and while Donna is away Louis would be sexually assaulted. The guy was only caught because the maintenance worker Thomas Simms who refused to follow the callers demands. Donna finally decided to call her boss, who the detective said he had been on the phone earlier with. When she got in touch with the manager, the manager said he had been asleep and had never talked to the police. Donna quickly tried to star 69 the caller, but he hung up. The man was David R. Stewart who was married with five children. He was caught through tracing the phone calls he made, and the purchasing of prepaid phones. The incident is disturbing enough, but what happens after could be more disturbing. Steward was tried, but was acquitted. Why because there was no real evidence. Sure he made the calls, but he didn't force anyone to do anything. Steward wasn't holding a gun to anyone's head Donna and managers at the other places he called all willing did what he asked. It's really is disturbing incident, especially that a married man with five children would do this.The story is gripping and riveting, but some people may find it hard to believe that people would easily believe someone over the phone claiming to be a police officer and doing the things like what Donna did. Especially if the people watching it don't know that it actually happened only a few years ago. I had a little trouble believing the story as well. I believe I wouldn't do what the characters did in the film or what actually happened, but I can't understand nothing like that has happened like that to me, so who knows. You also have to remember that human beings in general are followers who easily take orders and are controlled treating others badly, killing, raping and going to war just because we are told to. The story stays really close to actually what happened. Only the names changed. Like McDonald's wasn't used and the names of the characters are different. People may also not like this film because it's unflinching in the short film time in about one and a half hours. I'm sure people will find Compliance to be thrilling film that delves into the dark side of human nature and our reliance on authority figures or an unbelievable and boring film. Either way I think its good it will draw attention to the incident that I had no idea that happened, and that I'm sure few others did as well and that things like this still happen today.The acting is perhaps the best part of the film. Ann Dowd (Sandra) plays the character based on Donna. She is gripping as the manager as she forces Becky (Dreama Walker) to do lewd acts and other things, especially the emotion on Sandra's face when she realizes it was all a prank call, and what she had done. The recognizable actor in the film for me was Dreama Walker who I recognized from Don't Trust the B---- In Apartment 23 which I like. She plays Beck the character based on Louise Ogborn. Dreama is compelling as Becky as she is threatened and force by the Officer Daniels (Pat Healy: The prank caller) and her boss Sandra surrender her keys strip and do other things. Dreama effortlessly displays the confusion, hurt, fear, sadness and shock that her character goes through the night. Bill Camp plays Van Sandra's fianc&eacute; who is reluctantly brought into the mess by Sandra, and Pat Healy plays the prank caller who does a brilliant job, as you are shown shots of him relaxing in his home with not a care in the world or showing any remorse at what he was getting these people to do.Whether you know of the incident or not I highly recommend the film to draw your attention to the topic and themes. Overall Compliance is a great film, with excellent acting by the small cast along with a great story that is closely based on an actually event, and is one of the best films of the year. Also seeing the film will draw your attention to Dreama Walker who has shown her comedic ability in Apartment 23 and shows her dramatic acting ability in Compliance.",5,What would you

1600859,AJNW2SVETWAW1,B009OCR1OI,kacunnin,"[1, 2]","Craig Zobel's film COMPLIANCE is a disturbing recreation of an event that happened in a Kentucky fast-food restaurant in 2004.  Harried restaurant manager Sandra (Ann Dowd) receives a phone call from a man identifying himself as a police detective named ""Officer Daniels"" (Pat Healy).  Daniels asks for Sandra's assistance in the investigation of one of her employees, nineteen-year-old Becky (Dreama Walker), who is suspected of stealing money from a customer's purse.  Sandra goes along with Daniels, detaining Becky in her office, strip searching her, and eventually leaving Becky in the custody of Sandra's fianc&eacute;, Van (Bill Camp).  Following Daniels's directions, Van conducts a full body search of Becky, spanks her, and has her perform oral sex on him.This is probably one of the most squirm-inducing films I've ever seen, and if it wasn't based on a true story it would defy credibility.  It's hard to imagine anyone allowing themselves to be manipulated by a phone caller into committing kidnapping and sexual assault.  It's also hard to imagine the nineteen-year-old victim agreeing to any of this - and she agrees to all of it, supposedly out of fear for her life.  The question remains - why make this awful and degrading incident into a film?Zobel claims his intention is to shine a light on our susceptibility to authority.  The man on the phone says he is a police officer, and manager Sandra, her fianc&eacute; Van, and victim Becky all go along with his demands, even when those demands are patently ridiculous - there's no way any legitimate police officer would ask civilians to force a suspect into a sex act!  But all three characters are so intimidated by the authority figure on the phone that they do whatever he says without question.What bothers me about the film is its skill at turning viewers into voyeurs as we watch Becky being abused and humiliated.  We become complicit in the crime simply by our inability to look away (or to turn off the video!).  In the real Kentucky case on which the film was based, an in-store security camera recorded the entire 2  hour ordeal - the majority of that video is out there on the internet where scores of people have watched it (and there was certainly no pseudo-cop forcing them to watch).  Zobel may have been trying to make a comment on how easily we are manipulated by authority figures, but the film seems to be saying more about how attracted we are to depravity and the suffering of others.In the real 2004 case, a suspect was arrested (through phone records and calling cards he purchased at a Florida Wal-Mart).  He was suspected of doing the same thing at different restaurants and grocery stores across the country more than seventy times over a ten year period.  Ultimately, he was acquitted of the Kentucky charges, and he has not been charged with any of the others.  I was a bit disappointed that COMPLIANCE focused almost entirely on the incident itself, and provided little information about the arrest and trial.  Then again, that wasn't what Zobel was interested in.I have to admit I didn't enjoy watching this film - but I also couldn't quite bring myself to turn it off.  I remember this same case being used as the subject of an episode of ""Law & Order: SVU"" a few years back, with Robin Williams playing the prank phone caller.  In the episode, the focus was totally on how easily we foolish humans are manipulated by authority (Robin Williams's character was doing his pranks as part of a ""social experiment"").  With COMPLIANCE, the focus is more on how attracted we are to sexual perversity, something most of us would rather not be reminded of.  This is a well-made and frightening film that never quite rises to the level of social commentary.  Or, perhaps it's never totally honest in what its intentions are.  I have no doubt I would not be intimated by a voice on the phone, even if that voice claims to be a police officer (and even if this perpetrator pulled this same prank seventy times over ten years, it's more than likely there were many, many more times when he tried and failed to get his subjects to follow his commands).  But at the same time, I didn't turn off this film, did I?  As I see it, COMPLIANCE is more about human depravity than it is about our susceptibility to authority.  It just doesn't want to come clean about that.",3,This film is really about human depravity -- and it's not fun to watch,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,4350,"['Craig', 'Zobel', 'film', 'COMPLIANCE', 'disturbing', 'recreation', 'event', 'happened', 'Kentucky', 'fast-food', 'restaurant', '2004', 'Harried', 'restaurant', 'manager', 'Sandra', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'phone', 'call', 'man', 'identifying', 'police', 'detective', 'named', 'Officer', 'Daniels', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'Daniels', 'Sandra', 'assistance', 'investigation', 'one', 'employees', 'nineteen-year-old', 'Becky', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'who', 'suspected', 'stealing', 'money', 'customer', 'purse', 'Sandra', 'along', 'Daniels', 'detaining', 'Becky', 'office', 'strip', 'searching', 'eventually', 'leaving', 'Becky', 'custody', 'Sandra', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Van', 'Bill', 'Camp', 'Following', 'Daniels', 'directions', 'Van', 'full', 'body', 'search', 'Becky', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', 'him.This', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'squirm-inducing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'was', ""n't"", 'based', 'true', 'story', 'would', 'defy', 'credibility', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'allowing', 'be', 'manipulated', 'phone', 'caller', 'committing', 'kidnapping', 'sexual', 'assault', 'also', 'hard', 'imagine', 'nineteen-year-old', 'victim', 'agreeing', 'supposedly', 'fear', 'life', 'question', 'why', 'make', 'awful', 'degrading', 'incident', 'film', 'Zobel', 'intention', 'shine', 'light', 'susceptibility', 'authority', 'man', 'phone', 'police', 'officer', 'manager', 'Sandra', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Van', 'victim', 'Becky', 'go', 'demands', 'even', 'when', 'demands', 'are', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'way', 'legitimate', 'police', 'officer', 'would', 'ask', 'civilians', 'force', 'suspect', 'sex', 'act', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'intimidated', 'authority', 'figure', 'phone', 'do', 'whatever', 'question.What', 'bothers', 'film', 'skill', 'turning', 'viewers', 'voyeurs', 'watch', 'Becky', 'being', 'abused', 'humiliated', 'become', 'complicit', 'crime', 'simply', 'inability', 'look', 'away', 'turn', 'off', 'video', 'real', 'Kentucky', 'case', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'in-store', 'security', 'camera', 'recorded', 'entire', '2', 'hour', 'ordeal', 'majority', 'video', 'out', 'there', 'internet', 'where', 'scores', 'people', 'have', 'watched', 'was', 'certainly', 'no', 'pseudo-cop', 'forcing', 'watch', 'Zobel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'trying', 'make', 'comment', 'how', 'easily', 'are', 'manipulated', 'authority', 'figures', 'film', 'be', 'saying', 'more', 'how', 'attracted', 'are', 'depravity', 'suffering', 'real', '2004', 'case', 'suspect', 'was', 'arrested', 'phone', 'records', 'calling', 'cards', 'purchased', 'Florida', 'Wal-Mart', 'was', 'suspected', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'different', 'restaurants', 'grocery', 'stores', 'country', 'more', 'seventy', 'times', 'ten', 'year', 'period', 'Ultimately', 'was', 'acquitted', 'Kentucky', 'charges', 'not', 'been', 'charged', 'others', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'COMPLIANCE', 'focused', 'almost', 'entirely', 'incident', 'provided', 'little', 'information', 'arrest', 'trial', 'Then', 'again', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'Zobel', 'was', 'interested', 'in.I', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'turn', 'off', 'remember', 'same', 'case', 'being', 'used', 'subject', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'playing', 'prank', 'phone', 'caller', 'episode', 'focus', 'was', 'totally', 'how', 'easily', 'foolish', 'humans', 'are', 'manipulated', 'authority', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'was', 'doing', 'pranks', 'part', 'social', 'experiment', 'COMPLIANCE', 'focus', 'more', 'how', 'attracted', 'are', 'sexual', 'perversity', 'something', 'most', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'be', 'reminded', 'well-made', 'frightening', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'level', 'social', 'commentary', 'perhaps', 'never', 'totally', 'honest', 'what', 'intentions', 'are', 'have', 'doubt', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'intimated', 'voice', 'phone', 'even', 'voice', 'claims', 'be', 'police', 'officer', 'even', 'perpetrator', 'pulled', 'same', 'prank', 'seventy', 'times', 'ten', 'years', 'more', 'likely', 'were', 'many', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'when', 'tried', 'failed', 'get', 'subjects', 'follow', 'commands', 'same', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off', 'film', 'did', 'see', 'COMPLIANCE', 'more', 'human', 'depravity', 'susceptibility', 'authority', 'just', ""n't"", 'want', 'come', 'clean']",N/A

1600865,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B009OCR1OI,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Craig Zobel's powerful true story ""Compliance"" is one of those movies that almost dares you to look away. As a tense situation grows increasingly uncomfortable, the viewer becomes complicit as a voyeur and participant in a waking nightmare. Just as everyone on screen should know better and should display more sound judgement, you can't tear your eyes from the unbelievable and quite disturbing tale unfolding. It may be the most squirm inducing film of the year. Having caught ""Compliance"" at a tiny arthouse theater, I heard a lot of discussion outside in the lobby. A fair number of people simply didn't believe that the events depicted in the film could happen. But here's the thing, Zobel's script adheres very closely to the facts of an actual event! There isn't a lot of extraneous fictional material added in for dramatic affect, this sticks to the truth in a straightforward and matter-of-fact way. Based on a real life occurrence in 2004 at a Kentucky McDonalds, the movie's screenplay recreates (although in a fictional setting) what occurred in that store almost exactly according to the restaurant's security video, police reports, and court transcripts.On an average day at your local Ohio Chickwich, the harried manager (Ann Dowd) receives an officious phone call from someone claiming to be a police officer. He identifies a young employee (Dreama Walker) as a thief saying that a woman customer has reported her taking money from her purse earlier in the day. Claiming he has already spoken to Dowd's District Manager, he asks for her cooperation in expediting the investigation while his team is detained. What follows, playing out in basically 90 minutes of real time, is a psychological manipulation that will have long reaching repercussions. Everyone wants to cooperate with authority (Dowd has already displeased her boss with one blunder today), and no one seems willing to challenge the caller even as things start spiraling out of control. The movie establishes fairly early on that this is all a sadistic prank, and once the caller has the store on the hook--he wants to see how far he can push things. Humiliating, debasing, and assaulting Walker, ""Compliance"" really starts to examine human nature and our willingness to please.I won't be any more specific. I will, however, say that ""Compliance"" has one random scene near the end that is absolutely brilliant in its understatement. Once the police are involved, we spend a wordless journey in the cruiser as an officer drives from the station to the restaurant. At first, I wondered why we were along for this ride. But it makes perfect sense. Zobel, in a minimalist approach, is showing just how close actual help and police were during the entire ordeal. ""Compliance"" succeeds on two very strong performances. Dowd, a great character actress relishing a leading role, is perfect as the woman caught in this moral dilemma. And Walker, whose defiance slips away to resignation, proves she's one to contend with. It's a demanding role and she is definitely up to the task. I can't say that ""Compliance"" is fun or entertaining, though, because it purposefully seeks to provoke. It's not a movie you will feel ambivalent about--love it or hate it, you will remember it and talk about it. In that, it is an unqualified success.

1600868,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,B009OCR1OI,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","&#34;Compliance&#34; is a dramatization of several different incidents where a caller to a fast food restaurant, claiming to be a policeman, talked employees into abusing other employees. The caller uses the technique of gradually asking the employees to go further in their actions; as they start to accept one thing, he pushes them to the next level.The action starts on an extremely busy day, as it happens, right after an employee forgot to close a freezer, resulting in a loss of about $1500 in spoiled food. The caller claims to have a customer with him who saw a young female employee steal money from her purse. He also knows the district supervisor's name, and claims to have him on another line. He starts by asking the manager to search the employee, and progresses to making her undress. The caller says that the girl and her brother have been selling drugs, and claims to be searching her home at that very moment while the brother is under arrest. When the manager shows reluctance to undress the girl, the caller says that the only alternative would be for him to come to the restaurant, arrest the girl, and take her to jail. But if they search her in the restaurant, all that can be avoided.At this point, I wondered why she didn't ask to speak to the district supervisor, if only to make sure that she was adhering to company policy. But the store manager doesn't think of this. In order to be able to get back to work, she calls her fiance, who has been drinking with some friends, to come in and watch the girl until the officer arrives. The caller manages to convince this man to spank the girl, followed by the girl performing oral sex on him. Why didn't the discussion that led to this set off any alarm bells? Even if he thought the caller was a policeman, wouldn't he have said that since he was engaged to be married, he felt uncomfortable with this series of events? Apparently, in at least one real-life case, this objection wasn't raised.An interesting change takes place in the manager's mind as events unfold. At the beginning, she tells the other employees that the girl is &#34;suspected&#34; of stealing something from a customer. Later, this is modified into the unequivocal &#34;she stole something.&#34; It's as if the manager has to justify what is going on by presuming that the girl is guilty.The sequence finally ends when another employee comes in and is asked to watch the girl. The caller oversteps here by asking him to undress the girl again. Not having been present for the preceding events, this employee reacts more normally to what sounds to him like an anonymous voice on the phone. He leaves the room, complaining that the caller's request wasn't &#34;policemanly.&#34; Another employee confirms that the girl's brother, far from being under arrest as the caller claimed, is actually out of town. The manager confirms that the district supervisor has been out sick all day. The real police station, we discover, was less than five minutes away.The film is disturbing because we cannot help but wonder how we would have reacted in the same situation. We would like to think that we wouldn't have been fooled, but through the entire process, we know we have access to information that the participants lacked. As social animals, we know we're not supposed to undress and search each other for no reason, and that innocent girls should not be spanked and forced to perform oral sex. But at the same time, as social animals, we are conditioned to respond to authority and follow instructions. The film depicts, on a small scale, what happens in situations of long-term abuse, exploitation, torture, slavery, and genocide. A dictator starts small and works his way up, until one group is shoving another group into concentration camps and gas chambers, and it all seems justifiable to the participants given the shared explanation. Meanwhile, people watching from the outside are horrified.Yet even in the most depraved situations, some people remain centered, and do not succumb to the temptation to follow orders, to go along with the status quo. What stops them is a high degree of compassion, the ability to put themselves in the victim's place and imagine what they are feeling. It may come down to having a higher than average number of mirror neurons, or it may arise from an independent streak, a mischievous desire to rebel whenever an authority figure tells them to do something. Human society could not survive if we were all independent rebels - stability requires most people to do their jobs and follow instructions. But for a society to be healthy and not just a collection of ants, it needs a few people whose response to the instructions is &#34;it's not policemanly.&#34; They recognize when the policeman has violated his contract and has become a tyrant.

1600878,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B009OCR1OI,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","To say that the movie COMPLIANCE is upsetting is an understatement. It's not just the movie itself that disturbs you while watching it but the fact that it is supposed to be based on a true story. Knowing that something like this could have happened makes you wonder just what people are willing to do without allowing morals to kick in.The movie takes place at a fast food restaurant where manager Sandra (Ann Dowd) is having a problematic day. Nothing seems to be going right, they're short handed and the usual customer complaints are happening. She then gets a phone call from the police telling here that one of her employees has stolen something from a customer. The policeman tells here that they're on their way there but to hold the employee, Becky (Dreama Walker), in the back until they can get there while he stays with her on the phone.Not thinking anything is wrong with this, Sandra takes Becky to the back office/store room to wait for the police, talking to her about what's going on. Becky insists she's innocent. The policeman on the phone asks Sandra to search Becky which she's not quite comfortable with but does. This is when it begins to get bad. The policeman then asks Sandra to strip search Becky, insisting that she remove every article of clothing she's wearing.Now some of us would refuse to do so, but the question raised by this film is what happens when someone complies with what the person on the phone tells them to do? In the case here it turns out, and we the viewers already know, that the man isn't an officer at all but a prank caller who gets off making calls like this. But Sandra does as he says, humiliating Becky in the process who must stand there naked until she's given something to wear.As the film progresses the ""officer"" continues to have Sandra as well as other members of the staff follow his instructions. Sandra never considers calling her home office or district manager; in part because it's the weekend and she knows her DM is busy at the moment. But to think that she would follow these instructions, odd as they may seem, is a terrifying thing to consider. All the while I kept wondering why they continued to obey and not seriously question the ""officer"" when no one showed after several hours.The movie is a chilling experience to watch and an uncomfortable one as well, but that doesn't make it a movie that isn't worth watching. The acting is credible and that's more important than anything with a film like this. You truly believe that these people are caught up in obeying the voice of authority that they trust no matter what they are asked to do. These requests begin as simple ones but eventually lead up to a most horrifying demand that makes you wonder what these people were thinking to listen to this.I'm sure this film is designated as a drama but in truth I consider it a horror film of sorts. There are not monsters with fangs or claws, there are no ghosts or mangled revenge seeking stalkers, there are simply normal everyday people placed into a situation of being told what to do and blindly following. The monsters here are us and that makes the acts witnessed here truly terrifying.",4,UNNERVING,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,3166,"['say', 'movie', 'COMPLIANCE', 'upsetting', 'understatement', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'watching', 'fact', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Knowing', 'something', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'wonder', 'just', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'do', 'allowing', 'morals', 'kick', 'in.The', 'movie', 'place', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'where', 'manager', 'Sandra', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'having', 'problematic', 'day', 'Nothing', 'be', 'going', 'right', ""'re"", 'short', 'handed', 'usual', 'customer', 'complaints', 'are', 'happening', 'then', 'phone', 'call', 'police', 'telling', 'here', 'one', 'employees', 'stolen', 'something', 'customer', 'policeman', 'here', ""'re"", 'way', 'there', 'hold', 'employee', 'Becky', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'back', 'can', 'get', 'there', 'phone.Not', 'thinking', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Sandra', 'Becky', 'back', 'office/store', 'room', 'wait', 'police', 'talking', 'what', 'going', 'Becky', 'innocent', 'policeman', 'phone', 'Sandra', 'search', 'Becky', 'not', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'when', 'get', 'bad', 'policeman', 'then', 'Sandra', 'strip', 'search', 'Becky', 'insisting', 'remove', 'article', 'clothing', 'wearing.Now', 'would', 'refuse', 'do', 'so', 'question', 'raised', 'film', 'what', 'when', 'someone', 'what', 'person', 'phone', 'do', 'case', 'here', 'out', 'viewers', 'already', 'know', 'man', ""n't"", 'officer', 'prank', 'caller', 'who', 'off', 'making', 'calls', 'Sandra', 'humiliating', 'Becky', 'process', 'who', 'must', 'stand', 'naked', 'given', 'something', 'wear.As', 'film', 'officer', 'have', 'Sandra', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'members', 'staff', 'follow', 'instructions', 'Sandra', 'never', 'calling', 'home', 'office', 'district', 'manager', 'part', 'weekend', 'DM', 'busy', 'moment', 'think', 'would', 'follow', 'instructions', 'odd', 'may', 'seem', 'terrifying', 'thing', 'consider', 'while', 'kept', 'wondering', 'why', 'continued', 'obey', 'not', 'seriously', 'question', 'officer', 'when', 'one', 'showed', 'several', 'hours.The', 'movie', 'chilling', 'experience', 'watch', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'as', 'well', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', ""n't"", 'worth', 'watching', 'acting', 'credible', 'more', 'important', 'anything', 'film', 'truly', 'believe', 'people', 'are', 'caught', 'up', 'obeying', 'voice', 'authority', 'trust', 'matter', 'what', 'are', 'asked', 'do', 'requests', 'begin', 'simple', 'ones', 'eventually', 'lead', 'up', 'most', 'horrifying', 'demand', 'wonder', 'what', 'people', 'were', 'thinking', 'listen', 'this.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'designated', 'drama', 'truth', 'consider', 'horror', 'film', 'sorts', 'are', 'not', 'monsters', 'fangs', 'claws', 'are', 'ghosts', 'mangled', 'revenge', 'seeking', 'stalkers', 'are', 'simply', 'normal', 'everyday', 'people', 'placed', 'situation', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'do', 'blindly', 'following', 'monsters', 'here', 'are', 'acts', 'witnessed', 'here', 'truly', 'terrifying']",N/A

About midway through this 90 minute film, I'm shaking my head saying to myself, ""there's no way this would happen.""  Unfortunately it did and if you believe the film's epilog, it happened over 70 times in a relatively short period.Sandra (award worthy Ann Dowd) is the manager of a chicken fast food restaurant in Ohio.  She's pretty much all business, concerned about some food being spoiled and the fact they've run out of bacon as a result.  Becky (Dreama Walker) is a 19 year old counter clerk who ""really needs this job.""  During the busiest part of the day, Sandra is called to the phone and speaks to what she is told is a police detective investigating a complaint that Becky stole money from a woman's purse.The detective convinces Sandra that her help is needed to determine if the complaint is factual.  Becky denies the accusations and just wants to get back to work.  ""Officer"" Daniels (Philip Ettinger) through Sandra, asks Becky to disrobe.  Reluctantly both agree, just to get past it.  But it doesn't stop.  Others are brought into the mix, allegedly to ""keep an eye"" on Becky.  Becky spends the rest of the film naked or with an apron covering up her vitals.This is a disturbing film and squirm inducing throughout the second half, so be prepared.  What makes the movie so authentic are some strong low key performances, especially from Dowd and Walker.  I was somewhat disappointed that the epilog didn't address what happened to those involved in these real life events.  Guaranteed to make you think.The Blu ray looks great.

Ann Dowd (Sandra the Mgr) is incredible as the overworked stressed out boss of a fast food chain who is so worried about losing her job or being reprimanded by ""Regional Management"" or the police that she willingly participates in the sexual assault of Becky.  While watching this movie it's easy to imagine that you would never do anything so stupid. Sadly the fact that the story is true more than 70 times in the US proves that we are that stupid.  The most difficult to watch is Becky going along with her own demeaning assault.This was a very thought provoking movie that wasn't at all slow.  I believe that part of stretching those store room scenes out is what makes the movie so provocative.  We in some small way get to feel how long this night was for Becky.

However, the only reason for doing so was it being late at night and I was viewing online via Kindle Fire.  If I had been watching on regular glube tube or dvd, I would have walked mid-way through.I find it very hard to believe there are folks among us in &#34;fast food&#34; services that are just this silly and ignorant.  In fact, honestly, I came away with a &#34;not so good&#34; feeling about people working at these establishments.  I do not want to categorize any group of working Americans, but this movie did nothing but display the level of education, and intellect of folks cooking those burgers and fries at the good ole' American icons.  You know the ones as they are American icons so to speak.  Go Mickey D, and their dear ole' competitors.Folks, this is suppose to be a documentary of real events.  As such, then great, maybe we can believe this actually did happen.  Do I believe it?  Unfortunately, as bad as I do not want to believe this story, I do.  It simply cries out to any viewers to be more aware of what is going on around you.  Hang up if in doubt comes to mind to say the least...Further, the manager...if, in fact, there was such a manager, she should be completely ashamed of herself for her judgments, and her feeling of the need to rush, and manage without true considerations of her staff.Finally, it just gives one the &#34;creeps&#34; knowing there are those around us who get their sick &#34;jollies&#34; by doing such a thing to others.  But, hey, this is America, the great melting pot where neighbors use to be neighbors, and now we all lock our doors at night.  Maybe that is the true story behind this movie...wake up America, we are crumbling apart from lack of concern for others.Nothing spectacular, nothing to write home about...just a creepy movie if you have the time.",2,Epic Ignorance with a Creepy Tone,1363219200,"03 14, 2013",2013,1959,"['Not', 'even', 'sure', 'where', 'how', 'begin', 'ruining', 'movie', 'who', 'do', 'watch', 'have', 'admit', 'did', 'watch', 'movie', 'end', 'However', 'only', 'reason', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'being', 'late', 'night', 'was', 'viewing', 'online', 'Kindle', 'Fire', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'regular', 'glube', 'tube', 'dvd', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'mid-way', 'through.I', 'find', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'are', 'folks', '34', 'fast', 'food', '34', 'services', 'are', 'just', 'silly', 'ignorant', 'fact', 'honestly', 'came', 'away', '34', 'not', 'so', 'good', '34', 'feeling', 'people', 'working', 'establishments', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'categorize', 'group', 'working', 'Americans', 'movie', 'did', 'nothing', 'display', 'level', 'education', 'intellect', 'folks', 'cooking', 'burgers', 'fries', 'good', 'ole', 'American', 'icons', 'know', 'ones', 'are', 'American', 'icons', 'so', 'speak', 'Go', 'Mickey', 'D', 'dear', 'ole', 'competitors.Folks', 'suppose', 'be', 'documentary', 'real', 'events', 'such', 'then', 'great', 'maybe', 'can', 'believe', 'actually', 'did', 'happen', 'Do', 'believe', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'bad', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'believe', 'story', 'do', 'simply', 'out', 'viewers', 'be', 'more', 'aware', 'what', 'going', 'Hang', 'up', 'doubt', 'mind', 'say', 'least', 'Further', 'manager', 'fact', 'was', 'such', 'manager', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'ashamed', 'herself', 'judgments', 'feeling', 'need', 'rush', 'manage', 'true', 'considerations', 'staff.Finally', 'just', 'one', '34', 'creeps', '34', 'knowing', 'are', 'who', 'get', 'sick', '34', 'jollies', '34', 'doing', 'thing', 'others', 'hey', 'America', 'great', 'melting', 'pot', 'where', 'neighbors', 'use', 'be', 'neighbors', 'now', 'lock', 'doors', 'night', 'Maybe', 'true', 'story', 'movie', 'wake', 'up', 'America', 'are', 'crumbling', 'apart', 'lack', 'concern', 'others.Nothing', 'spectacular', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'just', 'creepy', 'movie', 'have', 'time']",N/A
1600893,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B009OCR1OI,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[0, 0]","In financial services firms, Compliance is the unglamorous but important department that makes sure people follow the firm's policies. One is aimed at preventing ""social engineering"": not, as you might think, checking the viral spread of welfarism across the institution, but rather stopping the systematic theft of commercially sensitive information, carried out in plain sight, by malfeasors who cold-call gullible employees and trick them into volunteering it.You'd be amazed how easily investment professionals can be suckered. Actually, probably, you wouldn't.But it's not just investment professionals who can be duped, as Craig Zobel's hair-raising new film makes clear. It hasn't got anything to do with financial services, much less compliance departments, but it has a lot to do with social engineering. Only in this case, it takes place in an Ohio fast food joint, and it takes a much nastier form.The first thing to say is how well Compliance conveys, in its opening scenes, the deplorable misery of unskilled labour: Sandra (Ann Dowd) manages a busy ChickWich outlet. She's short-handed on the shift, she's expecting an undercover visit from franchise quality control goons, some clot left the freezer open last night spoiling thousands of dollars of food, and to cap it all off, she's badly low on gherkins.These are monstrous stresses compared with the pittance Sandra is paid. The last thing she needs is for a cop (Pat Healy) to call, reporting a customer's allegation of theft against an employee.If Sandra is powerless and vulnerable, she's got nothing on Becky (Dreama Walker), a pretty, 19 year old tillhand. Sandra's countenance cannot conceal her resentment of Becky's vitality, which fuels her suspicion that it was Becky who left the freezer open. Sandra is already susceptible to the suggestion that Becky needs firing, and Officer Daniels' call is welcome grist to the mill.Thus begins the ""compliance"": anxious not to exacerbate an already lousy day, Sandra does Officer Daniels' bidding, and ensures, when he asks for it, that others do too. As befits disenfranchised employees, they all do as they are told, including Becky, who is hauled into a back room and interrogated. Officer Daniels stays on the line and takes a perverse interest in proceedings. Becky denies everything. Well, you would, wouldn't you.Officer Daniels' behaviour grows more eccentric. We realise that his is a crank call but, like a frog in slowly heating water, Sandra never does.So commences the second act, an unbroken sequence of unspeakable acts which it would be wrong to reveal, as this comprises a large part of the film's emotional impact. It is not comfortable viewing. Much credit is due to Craig Zobel and his editing team for the technical achievement of building and maintaining an unbearable tension for more than an hour.As a straight piece of drama, though, the film is less successful. This is a cautionary tale, not a morality play: necessarily, the usual narrative arc is absent. There is a villain, but he is not explained. There is no hero, only victims, and they do not have flaws to overcome which justify their fate. They're gullible, but within a standard deviation of the norm: that's what gives Compliance its power.There is therefore no challenge to overcome or lesson to learn. These are people without sin, who do not (wittingly) cast stones, yet a stoning nonetheless goes on. It is difficult to know what to take from that: Craig Zobel achieves a valuable social commentary, but not a dramatic one.That's another way of saying that Compliance is a downer from beginning to end, and while it may leave viewers scratching their chins as they leave the theatre, they'll think twice before doing what a policeman asks in future.Olly Buxton",4,"Cautionary tale, not morality tale",1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,3771,"['financial', 'services', 'firms', 'Compliance', 'unglamorous', 'important', 'department', 'sure', 'people', 'follow', 'firm', 'policies', 'One', 'aimed', 'preventing', 'social', 'engineering', 'not', 'might', 'think', 'checking', 'viral', 'spread', 'welfarism', 'institution', 'rather', 'stopping', 'systematic', 'theft', 'commercially', 'sensitive', 'information', 'carried', 'out', 'plain', 'sight', 'malfeasors', 'who', 'cold-call', 'gullible', 'employees', 'trick', 'volunteering', 'it.You', ""'d"", 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'easily', 'investment', 'professionals', 'can', 'be', 'suckered', 'Actually', 'probably', ""wouldn't.But"", 'not', 'just', 'investment', 'professionals', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'duped', 'Craig', 'Zobel', 'hair-raising', 'new', 'film', 'clear', ""n't"", 'got', 'anything', 'do', 'financial', 'services', 'much', 'less', 'compliance', 'departments', 'lot', 'do', 'social', 'engineering', 'Only', 'case', 'place', 'Ohio', 'fast', 'food', 'joint', 'much', 'nastier', 'form.The', 'first', 'thing', 'say', 'how', 'well', 'Compliance', 'conveys', 'opening', 'scenes', 'deplorable', 'misery', 'unskilled', 'labour', 'Sandra', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'busy', 'ChickWich', 'outlet', 'short-handed', 'shift', 'expecting', 'undercover', 'visit', 'franchise', 'quality', 'control', 'goons', 'clot', 'left', 'freezer', 'open', 'last', 'night', 'spoiling', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'food', 'cap', 'off', 'badly', 'low', 'gherkins.These', 'are', 'monstrous', 'stresses', 'compared', 'pittance', 'Sandra', 'paid', 'last', 'thing', 'cop', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'call', 'reporting', 'customer', 'allegation', 'theft', 'employee.If', 'Sandra', 'powerless', 'vulnerable', 'got', 'nothing', 'Becky', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'pretty', '19', 'year', 'old', 'tillhand', 'Sandra', 'countenance', 'can', 'not', 'conceal', 'resentment', 'Becky', 'vitality', 'suspicion', 'was', 'Becky', 'who', 'left', 'freezer', 'open', 'Sandra', 'already', 'susceptible', 'suggestion', 'Becky', 'firing', 'Officer', 'Daniels', 'call', 'welcome', 'grist', 'mill.Thus', 'compliance', 'anxious', 'not', 'exacerbate', 'already', 'lousy', 'day', 'Sandra', 'Officer', 'Daniels', 'bidding', 'ensures', 'when', 'others', 'do', 'too', 'befits', 'disenfranchised', 'employees', 'do', 'are', 'told', 'including', 'Becky', 'who', 'hauled', 'back', 'room', 'interrogated', 'Officer', 'Daniels', 'line', 'perverse', 'interest', 'proceedings', 'Becky', 'everything', 'Well', 'would', 'would', ""n't"", 'you.Officer', 'Daniels', 'behaviour', 'grows', 'more', 'eccentric', 'realise', 'crank', 'call', 'frog', 'slowly', 'heating', 'water', 'Sandra', 'never', 'does.So', 'commences', 'second', 'act', 'unbroken', 'sequence', 'unspeakable', 'acts', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'reveal', 'large', 'part', 'film', 'emotional', 'impact', 'not', 'comfortable', 'viewing', 'Much', 'credit', 'due', 'Craig', 'Zobel', 'editing', 'team', 'technical', 'achievement', 'building', 'maintaining', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'more', 'hour.As', 'straight', 'piece', 'drama', 'though', 'film', 'less', 'successful', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'not', 'morality', 'play', 'necessarily', 'usual', 'narrative', 'arc', 'absent', 'villain', 'not', 'explained', 'hero', 'only', 'victims', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'flaws', 'overcome', 'justify', 'fate', ""'re"", 'gullible', 'standard', 'deviation', 'norm', 'what', 'Compliance', 'power.There', 'therefore', 'challenge', 'overcome', 'lesson', 'learn', 'are', 'people', 'sin', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'wittingly', 'cast', 'stones', 'yet', 'stoning', 'nonetheless', 'difficult', 'know', 'what', 'take', 'Craig', 'Zobel', 'valuable', 'social', 'commentary', 'not', 'dramatic', 'one.That', 'way', 'saying', 'Compliance', 'downer', 'beginning', 'end', 'may', 'leave', 'viewers', 'scratching', 'chins', 'leave', 'theatre', ""'ll"", 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'doing', 'what', 'policeman', 'future.Olly', 'Buxton']",N/A

When you look at it as a whole even though there were questionable things going on you can see how our own agenda and personal life can make you not see things you should be seeing.

She had so many things going on at one time I can see how she was relying on those she trusted to be doing the right thing not to say she didn't have fault in the situation as well. It really shows how those in positions of power or in this case perceived power can get people to do things they never would do by using there place of power to persuade someone to go against their better judgment. I feel it is a valuable movie that people should see because those in power are not always right. We still need to think for ourselves and not blindly follow the leader.

It premiered in the out-of-competition NEXT section at the 28th Sundance Film Festival in 2012, was shot on location in USA and is a US production which was produced by producers Sophia Lin, Lisa Muskat, Tyler Davidson and Theo Sena. It tells the story about a manager at a fast food restaurant in suburban Ohio, USA who one day at work receives a call from a police officer who tells her that he is with a customer who has reported her employee named Becky of theft and that she will have to keep her there until the police comes to get her.Distinctly and engagingly directed by American filmmaker Craig Zobel, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws an unsettling portrayal of an administrator who all though doing her duty after learning that a woman has accused one of her colleagues of committing a crime and to an extent questions what she is being ordered to do, complies to absurd directions. While notable for its naturalistic and mostly interior milieu depictions, fine cinematography by cinematographers Adam Stone and Scott Gardner and production design by production designer Matthew Munn, this dialog-driven and narrative-driven story about a conniving and vicious prank which is commanded, taken far beyond the limits and turned in to an exercise in deviating human behaviour by an antagonist`s morbid mind depicts a refined study of character and contains a timely score by composer Heather McIntosh.This sociological, psychological, situational and atmospheric thriller about authority and crime which is set in a fast food restaurant in America on a busy Friday where an affianced middle-aged woman becomes unconditionally obedient when she receives instructions from a caller who claims to be a policeman, is impelled and reinforced by its cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, efficient continuity, mindful examination of its central theme and the fine acting performances by American actresses Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker and American actors Philip Ettinger, Bill Camp and Pat Healy.

I mean after watching it, I turned to my wife and asked, ""Are people really this stupid?""The movies takes place at this fast food chain and during a busy day a man pretending to be a cop calls in to say that one of the women who works the cash register supposedly stole some money out of a person's purse.  That in itself is stupid because if you watch the movie you can see that you would have to reach up and over the counter to get into the person's purse.  It would be impossible to do that and not have the person see them doing it.Anyway, the cop has the manager bring this girl back to a back room and strip search her.  He then makes the supervisor take her clothes out to her car and leave them there while the girl waits for the police to come.  Eventually, he has another worker, a male come in to ""guard"" her but that doesn't work because he questions everything the cop asks so the cop asks the supervisor to call her fiancee to come and watch her.  He does.  So the cop makes him have her take off her apron and do jumping jacks to see if the money falls out any of her orifices.  Then, he has to give her a spanking because the girl talked bad to the supervisor.  After that she has to perform oral sex on him.  I'm watching this like what the hell?  Do you really think this guy is a cop?  I think the fiancee just liked it too much to stop.  He feels bad about it afterwards but he still let it happen.  I mean what is this guy thinking.  There's a moment when the cop asks him to describe the girls nipples and he doesn't question this.  If this is based on a true story, how stupid is this guy.  Does he really think how her nipples look is going to be pertinet to the investigation?  It's laughable.Eventually he has to leave so the supervisor brings in a maintenance man or something and the cop tries to get him to do the same thing to her that the fiancee just did.  This guy actually has some sense and because of his actions it helps to put a stop to the madness.I have to say that it's an interesting story that is supposed to be based on true events but I mean are people really this stupid.  I mean if someone really was accused of stealing some money don't these people think that the police would come right there and do some questioning, not call them on the phone and do strip searches, etc.  I was just really disappointed, not with the premise of the movie but with the stupidity shown in the movie.  Honestly, there's only one or two smart people in the whole movie while everyone else just does everything this ""cop"" asks.I wouldn't recommend the movie unless you want a laugh.  After a while that's what I was doing.  There are some moments when I was laughing out loud.  I just couldn't believe how stupid some people are.",1,ARE PEOPLE REALLY THIS STUPID?,1352073600,"11 5, 2012",2012,2829,"['So', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'movie', 'have', 'say', 'stupid', 'mean', 'watching', 'turned', 'wife', 'asked', 'Are', 'people', 'really', 'stupid', 'movies', 'place', 'fast', 'food', 'chain', 'busy', 'day', 'man', 'pretending', 'be', 'cop', 'say', 'one', 'women', 'who', 'cash', 'register', 'supposedly', 'stole', 'money', 'person', 'purse', 'stupid', 'watch', 'movie', 'can', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'reach', 'up', 'counter', 'get', 'person', 'purse', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'person', 'see', 'doing', 'it.Anyway', 'cop', 'manager', 'bring', 'girl', 'back', 'back', 'room', 'strip', 'search', 'then', 'supervisor', 'take', 'clothes', 'out', 'car', 'leave', 'girl', 'police', 'come', 'Eventually', 'worker', 'male', 'come', 'guard', ""n't"", 'work', 'because', 'questions', 'everything', 'cop', 'so', 'cop', 'supervisor', 'call', 'fiancee', 'come', 'watch', 'So', 'cop', 'have', 'take', 'off', 'apron', 'do', 'jumping', 'jacks', 'see', 'money', 'out', 'orifices', 'Then', 'give', 'spanking', 'girl', 'talked', 'bad', 'supervisor', 'perform', 'oral', 'sex', ""'m"", 'watching', 'what', 'hell', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'guy', 'cop', 'think', 'fiancee', 'just', 'liked', 'too', 'much', 'stop', 'bad', 'afterwards', 'still', 'let', 'happen', 'mean', 'what', 'guy', 'thinking', 'moment', 'when', 'cop', 'describe', 'girls', 'nipples', ""n't"", 'question', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'stupid', 'guy', 'really', 'think', 'how', 'nipples', 'look', 'going', 'be', 'pertinet', 'investigation', 'laughable.Eventually', 'leave', 'so', 'supervisor', 'maintenance', 'man', 'something', 'cop', 'get', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'fiancee', 'just', 'did', 'guy', 'actually', 'sense', 'actions', 'put', 'stop', 'madness.I', 'have', 'say', 'interesting', 'story', 'supposed', 'be', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'mean', 'are', 'people', 'really', 'stupid', 'mean', 'someone', 'really', 'was', 'accused', 'stealing', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'think', 'police', 'would', 'come', 'right', 'there', 'do', 'questioning', 'not', 'call', 'phone', 'do', 'strip', 'searches', 'etc', 'was', 'just', 'really', 'disappointed', 'not', 'premise', 'movie', 'stupidity', 'shown', 'movie', 'Honestly', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'smart', 'people', 'whole', 'movie', 'everyone', 'else', 'just', 'everything', 'cop', 'asks.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'want', 'laugh', 'while', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'stupid', 'people', 'are']",N/A

1600928,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B009OCR1OI,trebe,"[0, 0]","Although supposedly based to some extent on actual events, Compliance (2012), which mostly takes place in a fast food restaurant, quickly becomes ridiculous, but remains entertaining and outrageous, all the way to its numbing conclusion, which seemingly could have, and should have, come about much, much sooner.  The behavior of the characters may have you continually questioning their intelligence, as reality seems to have been suspended.  The acting performances come off as very natural and convincing, despite the remarkably unlikely things that happen, in this film written and directed by Craig Zobel.  Spoilers follow.Sandra (Ann Dowd), the manager at a Chickenwich restaurant receives a phone call from an Officer Daniels (Pat Healy), who says that he has evidence that a female employee is guilty of theft.  Becky (Dreama Walker) is brought into a back room, and is advised that she is under suspicion.  Accepting Daniel's authority, Sandra agrees to help with the ""investigation"" as he is unable to come to the restaurant.  Fearful of arrest, Becky also complies with what happens, which initially includes being searched, having her clothes removed, and then being detained for the remainder of the day, naked except for an apron.A turning point occurs when at Daniels' suggestion, Sandra gets her boyfriend Kevin (Philip Ettinger) to come to the restaurant to help.  Left alone to supervise Becky, and in communication with Daniels, Kevin continues the ""investigation"" which progresses to include physical abuse and sexual assault.  Only after these outrages have occurred, does someone really question Daniel's authority, and finally bring the house of cards tumbling down.Although there are some ties to reality, much of what happens is more of a twisted fantasy, as Compliance appeals to certain dark proclivities, and then takes you along for a ride.  It is revealed early on that Daniels is a scammer, so the provocative question becomes, how sick are things going to get?  With that dangling out there, it's easy to overlook the film's many flaws, just to see what that answer is.  Matters conclude at Chickenwich rather quietly, as the focus at the end is almost entirely on Sandra, while Becky, Kevin, and Daniels fade into the background.  Sandra emerging cleanly seems a bit ironic, seeing  that she is culpable in much has occurred.Subjected to any kind of serious scrutiny, Compliance soon becomes ludicrous.  Why does almost everyone believe Daniels, and carry out his instructions like robots, instead of questioning them, or simply lying to him?  Following his directions for a short time might be plausible, but the incident is prolonged for many hours, and reaches extremes that test ethical and moral boundaries.  Does is seem credible that Becky would sit around naked all day and into the night?  Sandra calls her boyfriend for help, yet she never calls her supervisor or the police department.  The focus on work by the Chickenwich staff is remarkable, as apparently except for Sandra, no one communicates with anyone to discuss what is happening.Fast food restaurants are almost universal, so the setting and operations seem very familiar, even to those who have never worked in one.  Although many scenes involve people just having phone conversations, the acting performances are quite good, and really help to sell a story that is absurd at times.  Ann Dowd is convincing as a harried and confused manager, who is in way over her head, and Dreama Walker (Seven Deadly Sins,Vamperifica) is excellent, in a role where she is repeatedly abused and degraded.Putting aside its faults, Compliance is a compelling watch, particularly when it becomes clear that a fraud is being perpetrated.  Watching the slow side into disaster, is a sick kind of fun.  Despite assurances that such scams are common, one would hope that people are really not as gullible and foolish as those in this film.",4,a matter of supreme gullibility...,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",2013,3922,"['supposedly', 'based', 'extent', 'actual', 'events', 'Compliance', '2012', 'mostly', 'place', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'quickly', 'ridiculous', 'entertaining', 'outrageous', 'way', 'numbing', 'conclusion', 'seemingly', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'come', 'about', 'much', 'much', 'sooner', 'behavior', 'characters', 'may', 'have', 'continually', 'questioning', 'intelligence', 'reality', 'have', 'been', 'suspended', 'acting', 'performances', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'natural', 'convincing', 'remarkably', 'unlikely', 'things', 'happen', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Craig', 'Zobel', 'Spoilers', 'follow.Sandra', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'manager', 'Chickenwich', 'restaurant', 'phone', 'call', 'Officer', 'Daniels', 'Pat', 'Healy', 'who', 'evidence', 'female', 'employee', 'guilty', 'theft', 'Becky', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'brought', 'back', 'room', 'advised', 'suspicion', 'Accepting', 'Daniel', 'authority', 'Sandra', 'help', 'investigation', 'unable', 'come', 'restaurant', 'Fearful', 'arrest', 'Becky', 'also', 'what', 'initially', 'being', 'searched', 'having', 'clothes', 'removed', 'then', 'being', 'detained', 'remainder', 'day', 'naked', 'apron.A', 'turning', 'point', 'when', 'Daniels', 'suggestion', 'Sandra', 'boyfriend', 'Kevin', 'Philip', 'Ettinger', 'come', 'restaurant', 'help', 'Left', 'alone', 'supervise', 'Becky', 'communication', 'Daniels', 'Kevin', 'investigation', 'include', 'physical', 'abuse', 'sexual', 'assault', 'Only', 'outrages', 'have', 'occurred', 'someone', 'really', 'question', 'Daniel', 'authority', 'finally', 'bring', 'house', 'cards', 'tumbling', 'are', 'ties', 'reality', 'much', 'what', 'more', 'twisted', 'fantasy', 'Compliance', 'appeals', 'certain', 'dark', 'proclivities', 'then', 'ride', 'revealed', 'early', 'Daniels', 'scammer', 'provocative', 'question', 'becomes', 'how', 'sick', 'are', 'things', 'going', 'get', 'dangling', 'out', 'there', 'easy', 'overlook', 'film', 'many', 'flaws', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'answer', 'Matters', 'conclude', 'Chickenwich', 'rather', 'quietly', 'focus', 'end', 'almost', 'entirely', 'Sandra', 'Becky', 'Kevin', 'Daniels', 'fade', 'background', 'Sandra', 'emerging', 'cleanly', 'bit', 'ironic', 'seeing', 'culpable', 'much', 'occurred.Subjected', 'kind', 'serious', 'scrutiny', 'Compliance', 'soon', 'becomes', 'ludicrous', 'Why', 'almost', 'everyone', 'believe', 'Daniels', 'carry', 'out', 'instructions', 'robots', 'instead', 'questioning', 'simply', 'lying', 'Following', 'directions', 'short', 'time', 'might', 'be', 'plausible', 'incident', 'prolonged', 'many', 'hours', 'extremes', 'test', 'ethical', 'moral', 'boundaries', 'Does', 'seem', 'credible', 'Becky', 'would', 'sit', 'naked', 'day', 'night', 'Sandra', 'boyfriend', 'help', 'never', 'supervisor', 'police', 'department', 'focus', 'work', 'Chickenwich', 'staff', 'remarkable', 'apparently', 'Sandra', 'one', 'anyone', 'discuss', 'what', 'happening.Fast', 'food', 'restaurants', 'are', 'almost', 'universal', 'setting', 'operations', 'seem', 'very', 'familiar', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'worked', 'one', 'many', 'scenes', 'involve', 'people', 'just', 'having', 'phone', 'conversations', 'acting', 'performances', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'really', 'help', 'sell', 'story', 'absurd', 'times', 'Ann', 'Dowd', 'convincing', 'harried', 'confused', 'manager', 'who', 'way', 'head', 'Dreama', 'Walker', 'Seven', 'Deadly', 'Sins', 'Vamperifica', 'excellent', 'role', 'where', 'repeatedly', 'abused', 'degraded.Putting', 'aside', 'faults', 'Compliance', 'compelling', 'watch', 'particularly', 'when', 'clear', 'fraud', 'being', 'perpetrated', 'Watching', 'slow', 'side', 'disaster', 'sick', 'kind', 'fun', 'assurances', 'such', 'scams', 'are', 'common', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'people', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'gullible', 'foolish', 'film']",N/A

1600931,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B009OCR1OI,Turfseer,"[80, 95]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***'Compliance' is based on a bizarre, real-life crime that occurred at a McDonald's restaurant in a small town in Kentucky. The criminal who committed this crime also committed approximately 70 other similar crimes over a span of ten years; although the crime at the Kentucky McDonald's was the worst.The odd thing about the crime is that it was committed with the perpetrator on the phone in the State of Florida. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. All the events in the film are basically what happened during the real life event; except instead of a McDonald's, the establishment in the film is a fried chicken restaurant.The perp pretended to be a police officer and convinced the manager of the restaurant, that a young, teenage employee of hers had stolen money from a customer earlier in the day. He tells the manager, Sandra, that his colleagues are busy and she needs to take the employee in the back room, where she is instructed to strip search her.Any normal person with the slightest bit of common sense would have realized that this was some kind of scam or a pervert getting his rocks off from the get go, but Sandra is one of those people who never thinks of questioning authority, and follows everyone of the perpetrator's directives. Becky, the young employee, who now finds herself virtually naked, is covered only by an apron. The caller manipulates Becky as well, claiming that her brother could face charges, as he is also the subject of a police investigation.Things become even more cringeworthy (and I guarantee that you'll be squirming in your seat), when the perverted caller convinces Sandra to call her fianc&eacute; to the restaurant, in order to watch the hapless Becky. Van is even more of a 'Yes Man' than Sandra and ends up first spanking her for ten minutes and then instructs her to have oral sex, at the behest of the caller. This goes on for over two hours, as Sandra is outside, helping customers. Van finally leaves but calls a friend from his car, acknowledging that he just did a ""very bad thing"".After a custodian comes in and realizes what's going on, he has Sandra call her regional manager, who supposedly was at the police station with the caller but in reality was sleeping at home.How could anyone be so gullible to believe that the guy on the other end of the line was actually a cop? His instructions become so ludicrous, that any normal person would have realized what was going on. But we're not dealing with 'normal' people here. Like the good Germans in Nazi Germany, who followed 'orders', the employees of this particular fast food restaurant, simply 'complied' with the authority figure who was giving them orders. Perhaps they had such a fear of punishment (the manager thought she might lose her job and the fianc&eacute; and the store employee, thought they might end up being placed under arrest), that this caused them to become the 'ultimate followers'.On a moral plane, some have argued that everyone involved in this incident was a victim. For me, at least Sandra and Van, as a result of their absurd gullibility and slavish devotion to authority, are just as guilty as the caller, for facilitating the events that occurred. You can make some excuses for Becky, due to her young age, but it's hard believing that she's representative of the average teenager (Dreama Walker doesn't quite hit the mark as Becky, acting more annoyed than in fear for her life; Ann Dowd, as Sandra, is much more convincing, as the clueless and arrogant company worker).Believe it or not, the police finally did catch the caller but he was acquitted at trial, after the prosecution was unable to prove definitely that he had made the actual calls to the restaurant. The fianc&eacute; ended up getting five years for sexual abuse but the real-life Sandra and Becky successfully sued McDonald's and got million dollar payouts (Sandra claimed McDonald's was aware of the prank calls but did nothing to alert their employees about them beforehand).One must acknowledge that 'Compliance' is a well made film, which keeps your interest from beginning to end. I don't think writer/director Craig Zobel, should be credited so much in the creative screenplay department, since he basically regurgitated the events that occurred from the real-life incident. And while the tension escalates nicely to the denouement, this is not a film that I'll be rushing out to see again. See it once, and you'll very much get the idea what it's about.'Compliance' has engendered quite a bit of discussion on the internet about the nature of those morally challenged 'yes men', who are unable to judge right from wrong, due to their subservience to authority figures. Let's hope that this incident (and others like them), are the exception to the rule--that there aren't a lot of people out there who would so readily follow the dictates of such a diabolical manipulator. But judging from history, my optimism about people in general, may  entirely be a pipe dream!",3,'Yes men' unite as 'Eichmann' meets 'Super Size Me',1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,5009,"['***',

This experiment was done under the guise of testing learning theory.  In many, many instances the subjects (confederates) screamed in pain and begged the subjects to stop.  Yet because the subjects were instructed to do so by an experimenter in authority, the subjects (playing the role of teachers) continued shocking the subjects.  These findings illustrate the power of authority in inducing ordinary people to do horrid things to others.  Naturally the ugly, unforgettable real-world manifestation of this is the holocaust.  ""I was only following orders"" goes the feeble reply when the Nazi and SS were forced to answer for their crimes.The film ""Compliance"" is a modern day, dramatic, creative, and compelling reenactment of the Milgram studies.  As such, it is a ""must see"" for academics from all fields, but particularly from those focusing interpersonal communication, leadership, persuasion, social psychology, sociology, journalism, law enforcement, and public administration.In addition to its suitable as an instructional aid and stimulus to classroom discussions, it is an extremely well acted andfascinating film.  Artistically, it is well photographed, and the dialogue and actors are superb.

The performances are so poignant and authentic that it is easy to lose oneself in the stream of events. The tension and pacing is nearly flawless, and there are no slow or dull portions within the film.The premise of the film (and crimes) is simple: call a fast food joint during the week's busiest day, present yourself as an upstanding member of law enforcement, and accuse an entry-level employee of theft. The rest writes itself as the demands escalate beyond what one could reasonably accept as procedure (isolating the suspect and searching their belongings).Where did the criminals come up with such schemes? Most likely the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s to test how far ordinary people will go when instructed to hurt people (the ""victims"" of this study were confederates who merely acted out the effects of electrocution). In most circumstances, under the guidance of a ""trustworthy"" authority figure, over 60% of experimentees showed they were willing to inflict fatal shocks to their victims.

During a busy night she receives a phone call from a person claiming to be a police officer telling her that a cashier, Becky (Dreama Walker) has stolen money from a customer. Sandra follows the policeman instructions (on the phone) in order to find the money. Together with the staff and her fianc&eacute;, Sandra does unspeakable things to Becky, until an old timer red neck shows up, disobeys the cop because he feels uncomfortable and ends the painful agony that everybody is going through.There are so many things wrong with the script in this movie that......but wait! This is not fiction. This script is based on events that really happened in this country. It shows the stupidity of the young generation, the low information voters, the people with the iphones and ipads, who care about the Kardashians and Paris Hilton, watch ""American Idol"" and read ""people"" from cover to cover. They don't read books, don't know history, have minimum education, and are cowards. Never did a sport in their life, never stood for anything else but themselves. It also shows the selfishness of some older uneducated people (Sandra and her fianc&eacute;) who just dream to get enough money in order to move to Florida. I know that is very chic to criticize the red necks and the people who live in the countryside, but without their common sense we can just imagine the tragic consequences of these stories.Five stars because the acting and the direction are just great and because this movie makes you think.
