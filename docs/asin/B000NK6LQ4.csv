1057700,A2GZVA22WYG95I,B000NK6LQ4,J. Olsen,"[1, 1]","This is the story of a young soldier trying to find his place after the war when his only family left is a younger brother in jail. His skill is fishing, so he follows the rivers and eats a lot of fish. At one fishing spot he encounters an old fisherman who tells him about a lake in the neighboring valley where there is a huge fish that no one can catch. He also tells him of a fishing contest they hold every year where people come from miles around to prove themselves as the best fisherman.He travels to that valley and finds the people welcoming and accepting of him and his skills as a fisherman. He makes particular friends with the sheriff's young mute grandson and they spend many hours together at the lake and the general store. A young widow, who provides the love interest,  offers him the use of her family's fishing cabin and he gets a job painting the local general store.**Spoiler Alert**While generally ""family friendly"" in the sense of the language and moral tone, there are some themes and footage that may be troubling to young children. The young widow tells Noah, the main character, that her husband killed himself at the fishing cabin after he came home from the war. And there are a couple of instances where the cabin is referred to as being haunted by ghosts, to which Noah simply replies that he doesn't believe in ghosts. But more disturbing may be the part where the sheriff's grandson is missing. After a lengthy search of the area, Noah finds his body in the lake and there is an emotional scene where he pulls him out and cradles him in his arms. This is followed by a scene of the boy's funeral on a dark, rainy day.There are conflicting reviews as to the ""resolution"" of the story ending. I think it is quite obvious that the soldier has found his place in life, especially when you consider that he writes his brother directions and tells him how to find his way ""home"". But I must admit that after viewing so much that was sad and unsettled, I would have liked to  ""see"" the happy ending and not just had it implied.I think the movie is very well done, but  it isn't something I would watch with little ones around and it isn't something I would reach for on a day when I needed a happy movie, even though it ends on an upbeat note.",5,"Good, but be advised",1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,2271,"['story', 'young', 'soldier', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'war', 'when', 'only', 'family', 'left', 'younger', 'brother', 'jail', 'skill', 'fishing', 'rivers', 'lot', 'fish', 'one', 'fishing', 'spot', 'old', 'fisherman', 'who', 'lake', 'neighboring', 'valley', 'where', 'huge', 'fish', 'one', 'can', 'catch', 'also', 'fishing', 'contest', 'hold', 'year', 'where', 'people', 'come', 'miles', 'prove', 'best', 'fisherman.He', 'travels', 'valley', 'people', 'welcoming', 'accepting', 'skills', 'fisherman', 'particular', 'friends', 'sheriff', 'young', 'mute', 'grandson', 'spend', 'many', 'hours', 'together', 'lake', 'general', 'store', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'love', 'interest', 'use', 'family', 'fishing', 'cabin', 'job', 'painting', 'local', 'general', 'store', '**Spoiler', 'Alert**While', 'generally', 'family', 'friendly', 'sense', 'language', 'moral', 'tone', 'are', 'themes', 'footage', 'may', 'be', 'troubling', 'young', 'children', 'young', 'widow', 'tells', 'Noah', 'main', 'character', 'husband', 'killed', 'fishing', 'cabin', 'came', 'home', 'war', 'are', 'couple', 'instances', 'where', 'cabin', 'referred', 'being', 'haunted', 'ghosts', 'Noah', 'simply', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'more', 'disturbing', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'where', 'sheriff', 'grandson', 'missing', 'lengthy', 'search', 'area', 'Noah', 'body', 'lake', 'emotional', 'scene', 'where', 'out', 'arms', 'followed', 'scene', 'boy', 'funeral', 'dark', 'rainy', 'are', 'conflicting', 'reviews', 'resolution', 'story', 'ending', 'think', 'quite', 'obvious', 'soldier', 'found', 'place', 'life', 'especially', 'when', 'consider', 'brother', 'directions', 'how', 'find', 'way', 'home', 'must', 'admit', 'viewing', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'sad', 'unsettled', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'happy', 'ending', 'not', 'just', 'had', 'implied.I', 'think', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', ""n't"", 'something', 'would', 'watch', 'little', 'ones', ""n't"", 'something', 'would', 'reach', 'day', 'when', 'needed', 'happy', 'movie', 'even', 'upbeat', 'note']",The Valley of Light - Hallmark Gold Crown
