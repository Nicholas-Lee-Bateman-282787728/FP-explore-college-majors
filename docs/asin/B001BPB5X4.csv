It's obvious here that Curly was in failing health.Highlights of this so-so musical are Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five's performance of their jump hits, ""Caldonia"" and ""Don't Worry About the Mule."" Former Boswell Sister Connee gives a powerful rendition of ""Stormy Weather"" and Gale Storm dances and sings ""Oh Brother."" She also does ""On the Sunny Side of the Street."" Phil Regan is heard and Will Osborne's band has a couple of numbers, as well. Windy Cook does vocal impressions of everything from a soda bottle to a saw.SYNOPSIS--To get his son to enter the family business, wealthy Daniel Warren Sr. sends Carol Lawrence with papers that will close Danny's nightclub. When Carol auditions and is hired as a singer the document never gets delivered.

1172964,A1VY2CG81I1JRR,B001BPB5X4,SingingDesigner,"[0, 0]","Interesting was the range of reviews for this title, with low ratings for the Three Stooges performance, and high ratings for the very same; and reasons to buy ranged for nearly each individual star in the film (Gale Storm, Stooges, Connee Boswell, and Louis Jordan).  Some found the quality great; others found it poor.  In short, it's nearly impossible to gauge what it is to like or dislike about the film based on the reviews to date.As of this writing, Amazon has this title priced at $8.99, and that's really the right price.  I only watched the colorized version; I will assume that the B&W; version is adequate.  Either way, you get both on one DVD.  One of the other treats I found on the DVD is the unusual but cute selection of bonus material: almost all somehow related to the main stars of the film (Gale Storm and the Stooges), you get a TV episode, a short cartoon, a snippet of an Abbott and Costello film with Shemp and Joe Besser (both Stooges) and a two reeler that felt kind of like a Stooge short but with other characters.  None of which would be worth much in itself, but better than nothing.As for the movie itself, I would give it 3 of 5 stars, as I think the Stooges are funny here (Curly's good despite his declining health) and the Louis Jordan numbers are great.  These were my reasons for wanting the title.  The rest of the film was, in my opinion, typical Hollywood musical fluff.  Not BAD, but not of any real value either.  Songs were good, production value okay... still, I just wish the Curly Stooges had one full-length feature to their name.Again, it was worth nine bucks to me.",4,Unknown gem worth the money.,1319500800,"10 25, 2011",2011,1616,"['Interesting', 'was', 'range', 'reviews', 'title', 'low', 'ratings', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'performance', 'high', 'ratings', 'very', 'same', 'reasons', 'buy', 'ranged', 'nearly', 'individual', 'star', 'film', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'Stooges', 'Connee', 'Boswell', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'found', 'quality', 'great', 'others', 'found', 'poor', 'short', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'gauge', 'what', 'like', 'dislike', 'film', 'based', 'reviews', 'date.As', 'writing', 'Amazon', 'title', 'priced', '8.99', 'really', 'right', 'price', 'only', 'watched', 'colorized', 'version', 'will', 'assume', 'B', 'W', 'version', 'adequate', 'way', 'get', 'one', 'DVD', 'One', 'other', 'treats', 'found', 'DVD', 'unusual', 'cute', 'selection', 'bonus', 'material', 'almost', 'somehow', 'related', 'main', 'stars', 'film', 'Gale', 'Storm', 'Stooges', 'get', 'TV', 'episode', 'short', 'cartoon', 'snippet', 'Abbott', 'Costello', 'film', 'Shemp', 'Joe', 'Besser', 'Stooges', 'two', 'reeler', 'felt', 'kind', 'Stooge', 'short', 'other', 'characters', 'None', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'much', 'better', 'nothing.As', 'movie', 'would', 'give', '3', '5', 'stars', 'think', 'Stooges', 'are', 'funny', 'here', 'Curly', 'good', 'declining', 'health', 'Louis', 'Jordan', 'numbers', 'are', 'great', 'were', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'title', 'rest', 'film', 'was', 'opinion', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'musical', 'fluff', 'Not', 'BAD', 'not', 'real', 'value', 'Songs', 'were', 'good', 'production', 'value', 'okay', 'still', 'just', 'wish', 'Curly', 'Stooges', 'had', 'one', 'full-length', 'feature', 'name.Again', 'was', 'worth', 'nine', 'bucks']",N/A
1172965,AYPJ6NY77MTYP,B001BPB5X4,Teresa Anson,"[2, 4]","Who needs that bum Shemp anyway?  Swing Parade of 1946 is a full-feature musical comedy starring the terrific threesome as they bungle and bumble their way through another one of their harebrained schemes; this time unsuccesfully attempting work as nightclub waiters (which is the segue for the film's numerous musical performances).Fans of the Stooges will relish the opportunity to see not just some of their rarer later work, but also Curly's last hurrah as a Stooge.  By this time, everyone's favorite goofball had succumbed to illness, and it certainly shows on-screen, in his physicality, demeanor and lack of energy.  It probably takes a more careful eye to notice the difference between his work in Swing Parade as compared to earlier shorts, and perhaps you'll relish the challenge as much as I.Beyond the boys' performances, the highlight of this DVD is the colorization process applied by Legend Films.  Growing up, I was only familiar with the Stooges through their extant black and white tapes.  The oppressive gray monotone served as a barrier between a bygone era and my young self.  I found that the colorization process (and it's quite good) allowed me to identify with the Stooges on a more human level than before.  Now I see them as regular, blue-collar everymen, when before they were merely objects of amusement.I'm sure that some you might object to the alteration of such nostalgic memories, and you're certainly right to feel that way.  And Legend, thinking of us, has thoughtfully included a touched-up (though un-altered) black and white version of the movie on the same disc as the newly colorized version.  So before you run off in disgust, just remember that at least this DVD gives you the option of viewing it either way.Also deserving a mention is the ""RiffTrax"" commentary provided by Michael Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  As a fan of the show, this was a truly special treat.  This particular commentary is a special option that allows you to hear Nelson's hilarious mocking sarcasm during the film.  Though typically reserved for making fun of bad science fiction movies, trust me when I say that it makes absolutely any film that much funnier.Also included in this DVD are a few notable shorts, making Swing Parade a true must-purchase for the Stooge fan (look at how much you get!).",5,100% Shemp-Free Fun,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,2331,"['Who', 'bum', 'Shemp', 'anyway', 'Swing', 'Parade', '1946', 'full-feature', 'musical', 'comedy', 'starring', 'terrific', 'threesome', 'bungle', 'bumble', 'way', 'one', 'harebrained', 'schemes', 'time', 'unsuccesfully', 'attempting', 'work', 'nightclub', 'waiters', 'segue', 'film', 'numerous', 'musical', 'performances', '.Fans', 'Stooges', 'will', 'relish', 'opportunity', 'see', 'not', 'just', 'rarer', 'later', 'work', 'also', 'Curly', 'last', 'hurrah', 'Stooge', 'time', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'goofball', 'had', 'succumbed', 'illness', 'certainly', 'on-screen', 'physicality', 'demeanor', 'lack', 'energy', 'probably', 'more', 'careful', 'eye', 'notice', 'difference', 'work', 'Swing', 'Parade', 'compared', 'earlier', 'shorts', 'perhaps', ""'ll"", 'relish', 'challenge', 'as', 'much', 'I.Beyond', 'boys', 'performances', 'highlight', 'DVD', 'colorization', 'process', 'applied', 'Legend', 'Films', 'Growing', 'up', 'was', 'only', 'familiar', 'Stooges', 'extant', 'black', 'white', 'tapes', 'oppressive', 'gray', 'monotone', 'served', 'barrier', 'bygone', 'era', 'young', 'self', 'found', 'colorization', 'process', 'quite', 'good', 'allowed', 'identify', 'Stooges', 'more', 'human', 'level', 'before', 'Now', 'see', 'regular', 'blue-collar', 'everymen', 'when', 'were', 'merely', 'objects', 'amusement.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'might', 'object', 'alteration', 'such', 'nostalgic', 'memories', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'right', 'feel', 'way', 'Legend', 'thinking', 'thoughtfully', 'included', 'touched-up', 'un-altered', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'movie', 'same', 'disc', 'newly', 'colorized', 'version', 'run', 'off', 'disgust', 'just', 'remember', 'least', 'DVD', 'option', 'viewing', 'way.Also', 'deserving', 'mention', 'RiffTrax', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Michael', 'Nelson', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'fan', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'special', 'treat', 'particular', 'commentary', 'special', 'option', 'hear', 'Nelson', 'hilarious', 'mocking', 'sarcasm', 'film', 'typically', 'reserved', 'making', 'fun', 'bad', 'science', 'fiction', 'movies', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'absolutely', 'film', 'much', 'funnier.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'few', 'notable', 'shorts', 'making', 'Swing', 'Parade', 'true', 'must-purchase', 'Stooge', 'fan', 'look', 'how', 'much', 'get']",N/A

I knew it would be interesting to see, and it is, but I would say this is impossible to watch more than once - with or without the Rifftrax commentary.  The movie is just plain bad.  Nothing happens except a lot of songs, some Stooge routines you've already seen before, a kid doing a bad sound effect routine, and one of the weakest plots in all history.  Seriously.  It starts out with a lady looking for a job to be able to pay her rent, and she works for one night club that's competing with another night club, and I think the night clubs might be owned by the same family, with the younger son trying to show he can stand on his own two feet.  Well that's all well and good, but then you get to a song.  Okay.  Then a Stooge routine, then another song, then a small attempt at looking like there's a plot still going on, then another song, then another song, then a Stooge routine, then another song, and then another small jab at continuing the plot, and the process repeats.  Then a new character is introduced 20 minutes until the end.  Then two more songs, and it's over.  I never figured out what happened.  Swing Parade is what its name implies.  A constant parade of songs from the swing era, and little else.  Dull, dull, dull.  You might as well just buy a record from the 40's, because this is no better.  It's actually quite worse with the meaningless skits that try to mimic plot development.  No amount of commentary can help this movie.  Watch it once if you're curious, but no more than that.

1172967,A3BD84P00Y0E3I,B001BPB5X4,Tony Bensley,"[0, 0]","This Legend Films DVD has been touted as being SWING PARADE OF 1946's best quality home video release.  In terms of visual quality, the Legend Films print is, in my opinion, a couple of notches above what one might expect from Public Domain Prints, which is the manner that SWING PARADE OF 1946 otherwise appears on Home Video issues.  With that said, lines and scratches do often appear, and I find the imaging just a little less sharp than I would like it to be.  With the few Legend Films DVDs that I own, I've noticed a similar pattern in terms of visual quality. Generally very good, but not quite top notch.  With that said, I think it is also important to keep in mind that with Monogram Pictures being a ""B"" Movie Studio, they didn't use the best quality Film Stock to begin with.  Thus the lines and scratches are understandable, though it is my opinion that an HD Transfer could have helped with the sharpness.The audio quality, while not anything to write home about, is in my opinion passable, particularly for a ""B"" Film of this Vintage.In my opinion, I would unfortunately be remiss if I didn't make mention of the fact that I've experienced some inconsistent playback issues with two different copies of this particular DVD Title.  This has to do with such things as momentary image freeze, and slight speedup at the beginning of one scene.  Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.  It could be that I just got unlucky, but I'm also thinking that there might be some quality control issues regarding the discs themselves.  And yes, I did check for scratches, smudges and dust particles on both DVD's; there weren't any!As far as the Film itself, I haven't much to add beyond what has been covered by other reviews, with a few exceptions.  First off, I was delightfully surprised by the amount of Screen time the Three Stooges enjoy here, though I find their slapstick just a bit toned down in this Feature.  I also couldn't help but draw parallels between Connee Boswell's closing number for this and Frank Sinatra's epic finish in TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY, which was released to Theaters about ten months later.  It is my speculative thought that the SWING PARADE OF 1946 closing may have served as a bit of inspiration for MGM, who of course had to top it, which they did!Oh, and be sure to watch out for young Actor Windy Cook's (?) amazing sound effects!  This guy was truly the Michael Winslow of his day, which makes it all the sadder that virtually nothing is known about him (Other than having been born Winfield S.
