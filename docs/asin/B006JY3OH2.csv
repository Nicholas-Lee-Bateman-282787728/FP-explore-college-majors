1516755,A21OTH2LUE1NJ,B006JY3OH2,"Bruce Miller ""hyper2u""","[3, 3]","I just finished the last episode of this series which made me appreciate all of the preceding episodes even more. It sort of all came together at the end. However, there was the usual ending where one could only hope to find another series or episodes. Not sure if anything is planned or what the release date might be, but it will be on the top of my list if something is announced. The scenery is spectacular (I often thought that it was filmed in the Pacific Northwest somewhere around Port Townsend) as it seemed so similar. The accents were a bit heavy and I found myself replaying the scenes so that I could follow everything. I am sure that I missed some of the subtleties, but it really wasn't a distracter. Jack always gets his man or his woman and his high morals are always on the verge of compromise by the exigencies which developed to deter him from his convictions. It is refreshing to see a story about the police (GARDA) where there are no guns and shoot em up scenes.Overall, I would rate series II as the better of the two series, but it would be difficult to enjoy the second series without watching the first. I enjoyed the episodes and it was another production of Acorn Media that further enhanced its reputation for top quality productions ! I hope that you enjoy this series as much as I did.",5,Jack Driscoll Makes it Look Easy !,1343779200,"08 1, 2012",2012,1317,"['just', 'finished', 'last', 'episode', 'series', 'made', 'appreciate', 'preceding', 'episodes', 'even', 'more', 'sort', 'came', 'together', 'end', 'However', 'was', 'usual', 'ending', 'where', 'one', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'find', 'series', 'episodes', 'Not', 'sure', 'anything', 'planned', 'what', 'release', 'date', 'might', 'be', 'will', 'be', 'top', 'list', 'something', 'announced', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'often', 'thought', 'was', 'filmed', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'somewhere', 'Port', 'Townsend', 'seemed', 'so', 'similar', 'accents', 'were', 'bit', 'heavy', 'found', 'replaying', 'scenes', 'could', 'follow', 'everything', 'am', 'sure', 'missed', 'subtleties', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'distracter', 'Jack', 'always', 'man', 'woman', 'high', 'morals', 'are', 'always', 'verge', 'compromise', 'exigencies', 'developed', 'deter', 'convictions', 'refreshing', 'see', 'story', 'police', 'GARDA', 'where', 'are', 'guns', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'scenes.Overall', 'would', 'rate', 'series', 'II', 'better', 'two', 'series', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'second', 'series', 'watching', 'first', 'enjoyed', 'episodes', 'was', 'production', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'further', 'enhanced', 'reputation', 'top', 'quality', 'productions', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'did']","Single-Handed, Set 2"

The basic premise is about the relocation of a Dublin cop, somewhat tarnished, to the hinterlands where he grew up.  Now an adult, he finally realizes that there is crime and corruption even away from the big city.  Each episode is, of course, about him solving another crime (not just your basic murder, but more convoluted and complicated crimes). I was pleasantly suprised and impressed and, as you can see, went on to purchase Part 2.  The stories do not insult your intelligence, the actors are superb, and you can't help but be in awe of the fabulous northwest Irish scenery (makes you want to take a trip there to see the real thing!).  The cast draws you in - they're real people, not Hollywood pretty faces.  You become so engrossed in the story that, when done, you find yourself wanting more.

Season two (2) of ""Singlehanded"" is on three (3) discs with two (2) interrelated stories on each disc that are over an hour in length for each part of the episode.Once again, former ""big city"" cop Jack Driscoll (superbly acted by ""hunky"" Owen McDonnell) is back in a small and very beautiful seaside village on the coast of Ireland.  This little village is ""ripe"" with crime involving, extra marital affairs that lead to murder, child prostitution, rebellious teens, illicit love affairs, ""shady"" businessmen, etc.  Jack Driscoll all by himself must confront a host of well written, ""spine tingling"" criminal activities.Jack indeed confronts some really nasty situations this season that again seems to involve everyone including his own family in this small Irish village.  Remember that the inhabitants of this village before Jack were very use to a much ""looser"" enforcement of the laws and of justice.  Jack's father (his predecessor as ""head cop"") tended to turn ""a blind eye"" to the crimes occurring in the village.  Jack Driscoll is a far ""tougher"" enforcer of the laws on all no matter who they may be which leads to some fascinating confrontations between him and the inhabitants of the village.I really enjoyed Season two (2) of ""Singlehanded"" because it is so well acted, written and directed.(By the way, I used the subtitles because the Irish accents could get a little thick.)",5,Fighting for justice alone,1334188800,"04 12, 2012",2012,1497,"['Once', 'again', 'series', 'Singlehanded', 'Season', 'two', '2', 'provided', 'superior', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'Season', 'two', '2', 'Singlehanded', 'three', '3', 'discs', 'two', '2', 'interrelated', 'stories', 'disc', 'are', 'hour', 'length', 'part', 'episode.Once', 'again', 'former', 'big', 'city', 'cop', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'superbly', 'acted', 'hunky', 'Owen', 'McDonnell', 'back', 'small', 'very', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'village', 'coast', 'Ireland', 'little', 'village', 'ripe', 'crime', 'involving', 'extra', 'marital', 'affairs', 'lead', 'murder', 'child', 'prostitution', 'rebellious', 'teens', 'illicit', 'love', 'affairs', 'shady', 'businessmen', 'etc', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'all', 'must', 'confront', 'host', 'well', 'written', 'spine', 'tingling', 'criminal', 'activities.Jack', 'indeed', 'really', 'nasty', 'situations', 'season', 'again', 'involve', 'everyone', 'including', 'own', 'family', 'small', 'Irish', 'village', 'Remember', 'inhabitants', 'village', 'Jack', 'were', 'very', 'use', 'much', 'looser', 'enforcement', 'laws', 'justice', 'Jack', 'father', 'predecessor', 'head', 'cop', 'tended', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'crimes', 'occurring', 'village', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'far', 'tougher', 'enforcer', 'laws', 'matter', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'fascinating', 'confrontations', 'inhabitants', 'village.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Season', 'two', '2', 'Singlehanded', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'written', 'directed', 'way', 'used', 'subtitles', 'Irish', 'accents', 'could', 'get', 'little', 'thick']","Single-Handed, Set 2"

Jack Driscoll (Owen McDonnell) has beautiful faultless Irish brogue, since the actor was actually from Galway, the filming local. I was astounded with Set 1, now blown away with Set 2. Not as bloody as most UK crime shows, but with more emotional suspense, some romance, and...did I mention the dramatic rural beauty? A solid regular cast including Finbarr (David Herlihy) & Costello (Sean McGinley (The Hanging Gale).This is Irish Copper Drama but could almost serve as a scenic views documentary if muted; since it is filmed in the Tully Cross & Connemara, arguably the rugged quarter of Heaven.  Even see peat dug and stacked, all that's missing is the aroma & Guinness.3 episodes each divided into 2 parts, each part 50 min. Each story has its own main plot, but the sub-plots and relationships developed in the first carry on through the entire set. It's compelling enough you may have to watch it all in one setting.SUBTITLES includedTHE LOST BOYS: An old man's body is found, and a local teen accused. A couple travels to Co. Galway with a mystery. Brian (Matthew McNulty-Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One) & Gemma (Simone Lahbib- Monarch of the Glen) look for his family, and a surprising family link is found with the help of Jack's mom, Eithne (Ruth McCabe). There's a deeper darker mystery that Jack must solve while finding a reason for an old recluse's death. Stephen Rea also guest stars.BETWEEN TWO FIRES: An insurance arson case suddenly looks to be murder. Once again Jack's personal life conflicts with his Garda duty. Are friends involved in crimes? Former Garda Costello is pushing local nightclub plans. An insurance adjuster (Conor Mullen- Island at War), Jack's former boss, is brought into the case.A COLD HEAVEN: A sexual relationship begins for Jack as well as a local teen, she with a Dublin high flier or worse. This time it is Jack's temper that causes conflicts with private life and duty, even harming the safety of those he's paid to protect.

1516763,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B006JY3OH2,Jon Wynne,"[0, 0]","Late in the final episode of this gripping Irish police series, a character describes Connemara, the area of Ireland where the series is set, as &#8220;bleak but beautiful&#8221;. That pretty much sums up SINGLE-HANDED. Each episode contains a number of &#8220;beauty shots&#8221; which features the incredible natural beauty of the landscape. This attention to topographical detail suggests that the canvas upon which each episode is painted is virtually a character in the drama. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, but it does mean the viewer must come to the series with a mindset that mirrors the slower-paced, expansive yet claustrophobic world which the flesh and blood characters inhabit.And what is this world? It&#8217;s a place where the pace of life is slower and few of the people who are featured are likable, especially the principal player, flawed and haunted local Garda (Police) sergeant Jack Driscoll. But there is also a mystical quality that hooks the viewer and draws them in, even while frustrating them with the slow-as-molasses pace of the show. Perhaps it&#8217;s a valid representation of the mass of contradictions that makes up every human being. This runs the risk, however, of gradually wearing down the patience of the viewer.SINGLE-HANDED is top-notch drama on its own terms. Arguably unnecessarily vulgar in places (a fair smattering of meaningless swear words), the writing is crisp and allows for a great deal of brooding. And while the show avoids many Irish stereotypes, it runs the risk of promoting the inhabitants of Connemara as an unattractive bunch who could do serious damage to Irish tourism.I wouldn&#8217;t want to meet any of these characters, especially Jack Driscoll, who seems totally devoid of a sense of humour. While shown to be a person of deep principles, he is also deeply flawed, becoming involved in relationships that invariably prove to be personally and professionally disastrous. If Jack is supposed to be the embodiment of old-fashioned values, then how about some restraint in the jumping-into-bed-with-the-next-attractive-woman-who-comes-along-department? Especially in light of his frequent protestations &#8220;let&#8217;s take it slow,&#8221; which apparently means let&#8217;s not have sex until we&#8217;ve had something to eat.No one expects heroes to be flawless in this day and age, but I firmly believe audiences crave a protagonist they can admire; someone who is, in some way, better than them&#8211;more principled, stronger, braver&#8211;without being annoyingly perfect. After all, the appeal of a traditional hero is that, just for a moment, we can imagine being in their shoes and doing more than we think we`re capable of. In classic tradition, the hero endures injustice or bad luck or whatever adversity they are dealing with, just long enough until we can&#8217;t stand it anymore and are desperate for them to take action. This is what justifies extreme behaviour (usually violence) and provides relief (or catharsis) from unresolved tension.While this reasoning does not fully apply to SINGLE-HANDED, the overall principle still applies: without sufficient resolution an audience feels cheated. SINGLE-HANDED works very well on many levels, but it comes dangerously close to robbing the audience of this precious feature of good drama. You&#8217;ve got to care about the central character. At the end of the last episode I wasn&#8217;t sure where Jack Driscoll was going or what he had learned. Or maybe I just didn&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m not sure which is worse.Others may not judge the show so harshly. I certainly don&#8217;t want to diminish the high standard of production or the impeccable performances that pepper the series. And there was certainly a glimmer of hope at the end, though it was tentative, like a single ray of sunlight peeking through a stubborn Irish cloud rather than a full-blown clear sky. It&#8217;s just that after all that has been endured, the audience deserves more than &#8220;the potato crop might not be ruined after all&#8221; kind of tempered optimism.All in all, SINGLE-HANDED is a very good show. But I was glad when it was over. Sort of like a long trip through the winding Irish countryside. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get to the pub before it rains.&#8221; And hopefully it won&#8217;t be in Connemara.",4,Bleak but good.,1397433600,"04 14, 2014",2014,4320,"['Late', 'final', 'episode', 'gripping', 'Irish', 'police', 'series', 'character', 'describes', 'Connemara', 'area', 'Ireland', 'where', 'series', 'set', '8220', 'beautiful', '8221', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'SINGLE-HANDED', 'episode', 'number', '8220', 'beauty', 'shots', '8221', 'incredible', 'natural', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'attention', 'topographical', 'detail', 'canvas', 'episode', 'painted', 'virtually', 'character', 'drama', '8217', 'not', 'bad', 'thing', 'mean', 'viewer', 'must', 'come', 'series', 'mindset', 'slower-paced', 'expansive', 'yet', 'claustrophobic', 'world', 'flesh', 'blood', 'characters', 'inhabit.And', 'what', 'world', '8217', 'place', 'where', 'pace', 'life', 'slower', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'featured', 'are', 'likable', 'especially', 'principal', 'player', 'flawed', 'haunted', 'local', 'Garda', 'Police', 'sergeant', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'also', 'mystical', 'quality', 'viewer', 'draws', 'even', 'frustrating', 'slow-as-molasses', 'pace', 'show', 'Perhaps', '8217', 's', 'valid', 'representation', 'mass', 'contradictions', 'up', 'human', 'being', 'risk', 'however', 'gradually', 'wearing', 'down', 'patience', 'viewer.SINGLE-HANDED', 'top-notch', 'drama', 'own', 'terms', 'Arguably', 'unnecessarily', 'vulgar', 'places', 'fair', 'smattering', 'meaningless', 'swear', 'words', 'writing', 'crisp', 'great', 'deal', 'brooding', 'show', 'many', 'Irish', 'stereotypes', 'risk', 'promoting', 'inhabitants', 'Connemara', 'unattractive', 'bunch', 'who', 'could', 'do', 'serious', 'damage', 'Irish', 'tourism.I', 'wouldn', '8217', 'want', 'meet', 'characters', 'especially', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'who', 'totally', 'devoid', 'sense', 'humour', 'shown', 'be', 'person', 'deep', 'principles', 'also', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'becoming', 'involved', 'relationships', 'invariably', 'prove', 'be', 'personally', 'professionally', 'disastrous', 'Jack', 'supposed', 'be', 'embodiment', 'old-fashioned', 'values', 'then', 'how', 'restraint', 'jumping-into-bed-with-the-next-attractive-woman-who-comes-along-department', 'Especially', 'light', 'frequent', 'protestations', '8220', 'let', '8217', 's', 'take', 'slow', '8221', 'apparently', 'let', '8217', 'not', 'have', 'sex', '8217', 've', 'had', 'something', 'eat.No', 'one', 'heroes', 'be', 'flawless', 'day', 'age', 'firmly', 'believe', 'audiences', 'crave', 'protagonist', 'can', 'admire', 'someone', 'who', 'way', 'better', '8211', 'more', 'principled', 'stronger', 'braver', '8211', 'being', 'annoyingly', 'perfect', 'appeal', 'traditional', 'hero', 'just', 'moment', 'can', 'imagine', 'being', 'shoes', 'doing', 'more', 'think', 're', 'capable', 'classic', 'tradition', 'hero', 'injustice', 'bad', 'luck', 'adversity', 'are', 'dealing', 'just', 'long', 'enough', 'can', '8217', 'stand', 'anymore', 'are', 'desperate', 'take', 'action', 'what', 'extreme', 'behaviour', 'usually', 'violence', 'relief', 'catharsis', 'unresolved', 'tension.While', 'reasoning', 'not', 'fully', 'apply', 'SINGLE-HANDED', 'overall', 'principle', 'still', 'sufficient', 'resolution', 'audience', 'feels', 'cheated', 'SINGLE-HANDED', 'works', 'very', 'well', 'many', 'levels', 'dangerously', 'close', 'robbing', 'audience', 'precious', 'feature', 'good', 'drama', '8217', 'got', 'care', 'central', 'character', 'end', 'last', 'episode', 'wasn', '8217', 'sure', 'where', 'Jack', 'Driscoll', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'maybe', 'just', 'didn', '8217', 'care', '8217', 'not', 'sure', 'worse.Others', 'may', 'not', 'judge', 'show', 'so', 'harshly', 'certainly', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'diminish', 'high', 'standard', 'production', 'impeccable', 'performances', 'pepper', 'series', 'was', 'certainly', 'glimmer', 'hope', 'end', 'was', 'tentative', 'single', 'ray', 'sunlight', 'peeking', 'stubborn', 'Irish', 'cloud', 'rather', 'full-blown', 'clear', 'sky', '8217', 's', 'just', 'been', 'endured', 'audience', 'more', '8220', 'potato', 'crop', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'ruined', '8221', 'kind', 'tempered', 'optimism.All', 'SINGLE-HANDED', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'Sort', 'long', 'trip', 'winding', 'Irish', 'countryside', '8220', 'Let', '8217', 'get', 'pub', '8221', 'hopefully', 'won', '8217', 'be', 'Connemara']","Single-Handed, Set 2"

Part of the reason is surely Owen McDonnell's portrayal of Jack Driscoll, and an excellent supporting cast.
