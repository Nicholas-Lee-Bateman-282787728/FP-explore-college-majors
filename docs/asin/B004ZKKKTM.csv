1434735,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004ZKKKTM,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[2, 2]","I have not seen the first movie and it might of helped as this one made constant references to it. Fortunately they tossed in a couple of flashbacks and slasher films are not hard to figure out. Brenden and Darryl are close friends who both have super wives who can't act. Brenden is troubled by nightmares which he believes are portent. In one night Darryl, Brenden's wife and niece are missing and Darry's wife shows up at Breden's place and she seems to be putting the moves on him...The movie soon turns into a torture film as everyone becomes a prisoner of the experimenting doctor, although it is not graphic. For instance, we see a cutting device move toward a finger, then we see a severed finger (without blood). The acting, dialouge, and plot were all fairly bad with few bright spots. The camera angels were awkward and I noticed it cut off the tops of heads too many times at the beginning of the movie. This is just amateur camera and directing mistakes. No real horror. Nothing to see here folks, just keep moving on.No F-bombs, no sex, no nudity.",1,THEY SHOULD OF STOPPED WHEN NO ONE SAW THE FIRST MOVIE,1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,1061,"['have', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'movie', 'might', 'helped', 'one', 'made', 'constant', 'references', 'Fortunately', 'tossed', 'couple', 'flashbacks', 'slasher', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'Brenden', 'Darryl', 'are', 'close', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'super', 'wives', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'Brenden', 'troubled', 'nightmares', 'are', 'portent', 'one', 'night', 'Darryl', 'Brenden', 'wife', 'niece', 'are', 'missing', 'Darry', 'wife', 'up', 'Breden', 'place', 'be', 'putting', 'moves', 'movie', 'soon', 'torture', 'film', 'everyone', 'prisoner', 'experimenting', 'doctor', 'not', 'graphic', 'instance', 'see', 'cutting', 'device', 'move', 'finger', 'then', 'see', 'severed', 'finger', 'blood', 'acting', 'dialouge', 'plot', 'were', 'fairly', 'bad', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'camera', 'angels', 'were', 'awkward', 'noticed', 'cut', 'off', 'tops', 'heads', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'beginning', 'movie', 'just', 'amateur', 'camera', 'directing', 'mistakes', 'real', 'horror', 'Nothing', 'see', 'here', 'folks', 'just', 'keep', 'moving', 'on.No', 'F-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",Somebody He Me 2
