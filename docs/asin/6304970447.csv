441987,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6304970447,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","SPOILERS throughout.No, RAW DEAL isn't one of the Governator's best flicks, not by a long shot. But it's not his worst either (ever cringe thru JINGLE ALL THE WAY, JUNIOR, or COLLATERAL DAMAGE?). Having been released on the heels of the high octane, vastly entertaining COMMANDO, RAW DEAL suffers from the inevitable comparison. This film does have quite a bit to offer Schwarzenegger fans, but, let's be real, it's not as good as COMMANDO. But is RAW DEAL worth watching? Definitely. Is it worth purchasing? I believe so. I bought it. But, then again, I'm an old fan of our muscled Austrian. Shucks, I even voted for him.As early as 1986 - when RAW DEAL came out - at the beginnings of his Hollywood career as he was still developing what would become his trademark cinematic identity, Schwarzenegger was even then charismatic enough to turn many an action fan's head. That he had a certain flair for droll one-liners was an unlooked-for bonus. In fact, I believe that his wry sense of humor and the implied intelligence that went with that was the decider in making him the overwhelming box office action king over the likes of Stallone, Seagal, and Norris. And Arnold was savvy enought to capitalize on his advantage. He had a firm grasp of his talents and rarely stepped outside his purview. In his role of Sheriff Mark Kaminsky, Arnold is well within his limited acting range. RAW DEAL makes no pretense about what it is: a slam-bang action movie that directly traverses from Point A to Point B and is jam-packed with auto carnage, blazing bullets and thudding fists, all the while showcasing Mr. ""I'll Be Back"" (a catchphrase which I don't think he says in this film).The plot: Mark Kaminsky (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is an ex-FBI agent now exiled into sheriffing in a small, nowhere town and saddled with an embittered wife. A promise of possible reinstatement from an old FBI colleague with a personal agenda convinces Kaminsky to infiltrate the Chicago crime syndicate and try to tear it apart from within; if possible, he's given the added task of unearthing the mole who's been selling out the FBI. Kaminsky stages his own death, slicks back his hair, and dons his double-breasted threads. In his attempt to get noticed by the mob, he makes a splashy showing at a mob gambling joint and, from there, rapidly works his way up the criminal hierarchy, occasionally tearing off chunks of mafia flesh.Is there much violence in RAW DEAL? You bet your arse, there is. Nowadays, when our film action stars all seem to practice fancy martial arts, popping in an Arnold flick in a dvd player is a bit like time travelling to the primitive, old school ways of villain smiting. Arnold never was that limber nor did he ever somersault in the air and execute a graceful roundhouse kick to the head. His style is akin to a relentless runaway train as he uses his monumental strength and power to subdue his opponents via wrestling holds and throws and that gool ol' American standby: the punch to the face. And if he can't hit you or kick you, for sure he doesn't have any compunctions about shooting you up full of lead. And then, of course, he'll submit the coup de gras: a witty punchline at your expense. In RAW DEAL, he uses his ""techniques"" to traumatize villains in mall clothing stores, gambling casinos, gravel pits, and mafia headquarters, the last venue being where he really launches into Terminator mode. You see, in his own fashion, Arnold does have a certain implacable panache.The acting? It's decent. Schwarzenegger is Schwarzenegger which means that Schwarzenegger isn't Anthony Hopkins. In terms of acting, Schwarzenegger isn't even Thelma Hopkins. But, here, he's ably upheld by his supporting cast, the most recognizable of whom are Darren McGavin, MURPHY BROWN's Joe Regalbuto, and the ever untrustworthy Robert Davi. Kathryn Harrold is so-so as the love interest (and, mind you, she's not the wife), actually shining for a moment in a restaurant scene with Arnold as she takes him to task for his lack of amorousness. And, yes, this movie drops one of my favorite Arnold wisecracks: As his unhappy, intoxicated wife heaves a cake at him, his character retorts: ""You should not drink and bake."" Classic. Another line overheard in passing which cracked me up: as Kaminsky and Davi's character were pursuing a man thru a crowded bar, an offended, bumped-into bystander comments with a ""Hey, you cretin!"" C'mon, who says that, really?",4,"""Who do you think I look like?

Arnold's character is attempting to infiltrate a mafia syndicate.  A friend's son was killed by these people and he wants revenge so he asks Arnold's character to help him seek revenge(he's to old to do it otherwise he would do it himself).  Arnold's acting in this one is terrible. None of the other actors stood out so well either although I did recognize the guy from the show Profiler. Arnold has a couple one liners that gave me a laugh but seriously much of his acting just doesn't cut it at all. Him attempting to be a suave mafia dude is hard to watch.The movie goes along way to slow and is very predictable. The action scenes are TERRIBLE. Commando looks realistic compared to Raw Deal's action scenes.  At one point Arnold's character is driving around a construction yard in a car shooting people twenty to thirty feet above him while his car is going going up and down constantly--he's also steering with his other hand.  He never misses, they never hit,a nd he's hold the guy like a toy.  There isn't even some any good looking girls in the movie. I'm a big Schwarzenegger fan, unlike some of the other reviewers here, and have see all his movies. This one doesn't cut it at all.

441989,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,6304970447,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","But what bothers me most is that from this kind of acting people widen to the personality, if not the intelligence of the person. They start blabbering about his life, what he did before becoming an actor, his nationality, etc. It is true he plays on it and relishes keeping some kind of Germanic accent. But that is more a decision of the director and producer than of the actor. Why do they keep that hard Germanic accent? You better ask them because there is no reason to do so in the film. Is that actor unable to make his English more fluent? But that is a side detail.The value of the film is quite somewhere else. It is in the plot of the film, the story the film is telling and altogether it is telling us the system in which we are living, and that means the world because there is nothing beyond  that geographical zone called the USA, Miami, Chicago, New York, the system and the world are sick but the evil forces are inside: inside the country with the gangs that are refusing any law; inside the local police with finks, traitors, rotten cops, and the film start with the spectacular arrest of one deputy sheriff by the sheriff of the small place where it all starts; inside the FBI where you have the same situation with rotten agents, when it is not fake agents sent by the gangs.The film is trying to tell us that the only way to keep these gangs in line is to do the same thing and infiltrate the gangs to destroy them from inside by turning them one against the other and killing all of the gangsters when they start having a gang war: when they are too busy killing one another, just come behind and kill them all. The most difficult part of course is to keep the infiltration secret and the infiltrator unknown, till the last minute and leave behind no witness who could speak.It is this conviction that danger is human, is inside human society itself, has to be fought inside that society with the same means criminals use, and that this fight pays and this danger can be controlled. That makes this film an interesting film because it does not alienate the audience into some puppets dancing at the end of threads of violence. There is the hope that there always will be one good one to fight back.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",4,Look for the meaning behind the action,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",2011,2242,"['what', 'bothers', 'most', 'kind', 'acting', 'people', 'widen', 'personality', 'not', 'intelligence', 'person', 'start', 'blabbering', 'life', 'what', 'did', 'becoming', 'actor', 'nationality', 'etc', 'true', 'keeping', 'kind', 'Germanic', 'accent', 'more', 'decision', 'director', 'producer', 'actor', 'Why', 'do', 'keep', 'hard', 'Germanic', 'accent', 'better', 'ask', 'reason', 'do', 'so', 'film', 'actor', 'unable', 'make', 'English', 'more', 'fluent', 'side', 'value', 'film', 'quite', 'somewhere', 'else', 'plot', 'film', 'story', 'film', 'telling', 'telling', 'system', 'are', 'living', 'world', 'nothing', 'geographical', 'zone', 'called', 'USA', 'Miami', 'Chicago', 'New', 'York', 'system', 'world', 'are', 'sick', 'evil', 'forces', 'are', 'country', 'gangs', 'are', 'refusing', 'law', 'local', 'police', 'finks', 'traitors', 'rotten', 'cops', 'film', 'start', 'spectacular', 'arrest', 'one', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'sheriff', 'small', 'place', 'where', 'FBI', 'where', 'have', 'same', 'situation', 'rotten', 'agents', 'when', 'not', 'fake', 'agents', 'sent', 'gangs.The', 'film', 'trying', 'tell', 'only', 'way', 'keep', 'gangs', 'line', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'infiltrate', 'gangs', 'destroy', 'turning', 'one', 'other', 'killing', 'gangsters', 'when', 'start', 'having', 'gang', 'war', 'when', 'are', 'too', 'busy', 'killing', 'one', 'just', 'come', 'behind', 'kill', 'most', 'difficult', 'part', 'course', 'keep', 'infiltration', 'secret', 'infiltrator', 'unknown', 'till', 'last', 'minute', 'leave', 'witness', 'who', 'could', 'speak.It', 'conviction', 'danger', 'human', 'inside', 'human', 'society', 'be', 'fought', 'society', 'same', 'criminals', 'use', 'fight', 'danger', 'can', 'be', 'controlled', 'film', 'interesting', 'film', 'not', 'alienate', 'audience', 'puppets', 'dancing', 'end', 'threads', 'violence', 'hope', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'good', 'one', 'fight', 'back.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

441998,A1K9IW99EFBZ52,6304970447,Mike,"[2, 3]","I've always seen the ""first wave"" of Schwarzenegger films ending with 1987'sPredator (Widescreen Edition). In the following year, he turned a sharp corner and ventured into ""buddy films"" with Jim Belushi inRed Heat, a movie which had its moments but is far from ""Academy"" standards. At the time, he expressed a desire to broaden his horizons, to not be typecast as an ""action hero,"" and this was admirable...but it also produced more than a few turkeys in his attempt to push the acting envelope.If you considerConan the Barbarianto be Schwarzenegger's first legit starring role, ""Raw Deal"" was his sixth film. His acting was still a work in progress (as was his ease with the English-speaking starring roles), but this is one of those movies that delivers a ""Saturday afternoon / Saturday night"" payoff every time. It's a ""go-to"" movie. There's mob violence and lots of things blowin' up real good (hat-tip to Joe Flaherty and the late, great John Candy).The film also contains one of the greatest action film scenes of all, in which Arnold shoots out / kicks out the windshield of his big ol' Detroit gas-guzzler, pops in a cassette of The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction,"" and heads right into the thick of things, blowing bad guy after bad guy away. He drives straight into the gunfire, straight into the belly of the beast, and in the best action movie manner, walks away with hardly a scratch.The mob guys are absolute cartoon mob guys, but that's half the fun. Anyone coming to this film looking for the work of a Francis Ford Coppola or Martin Scorsese is in for a real crash-landing of expectations. Actors Paul Shenar (as goon #1, ""Paulo Rocca"") and the great Robert Davi (as goon #2, ""Max Keller"") add the appropriate levels of henchmen smarm, and Sam Wanamaker's mob boss ""Luigi Patrovita"" is obviously cut from Gotti cloth.Veteran actor Darren McGavin delivers a serviceable performance as ""Chief Harry Shannon,"" but I've got to wonder whether his heart was really in this performance. I'd love to read an interview in which he discusses whether he enjoyed playing the role or not. I have my doubts. He never really ""owns"" the character.You've seen movies labeled as ""mindless fun,"" and this is certainly one of them, but in a 5-star toss some popcorn in the microwave kind of way.Schwarzenegger's films became different in the 1990s, with a confidence-bordering-on-arrogance that comes from an actor having proven himself. In fact, it wasn't until the humbling defeat of 1993'sThe Last Action Herothat his interviews turned from self-promotion to an open admission that he, too, was capable of turning out a box office flop.""Raw Deal"" was the end of an era, but an era that still has legs, two decades later.

His old boss' son, who has become a mob informant, is whacked while in hiding, so the FBI chief brings Arnie out of retirement 'unofficially' to whoop some serious 80s hiney.  It's sort of like Death Wish 3, with the cops (or FBI) hiring a professional to clean up the town.  This time it's Chicago, which had more than its fair share of 80s shoot em ups and would of course re-welcome Arnold in Red Heat two years later.What follows is the big guy infilitrating the Chicago Outfit, which features some reliable character actors like Robert Davi and even Sosa from Scarface, who looks like bizarro Sam Neil and this time plays an Italian, not a Cuban.  What difference does it make?  Eventually, Arnold blows his cover, some other stuff happens, and a lot of people get blown away, some publicly.The climax is kind of like the Tech Noir scene from The Terminator, except this time Arnie is the good guy, and whole lot more liquor and glass get wasted as inept mobsters are shot to pieces.  At one point, there's a shootout from about three feet away.  Guess who wins?Completely dependable shoot-em-up for a slow night, full of 80s staples like the 'getting geared up for battle scene' (featuring guns being assembled, loaded, cocked, and holstered in a scene begging for theoretical analysis of male adequacy), as well 'humorous' scenes with Arnold in what was already an attempt to explore his 'range' as an actor.Some more quality one liners, a memorable use of the Stones' 'Satisfaction', some guys getting shot and falling from great heights, a guy getting shot at a cemetary, the requisite public car chase, and other niceties.Cheap DVD, no real extras, but inflation-adjusted still up there with the cost of the original movie ticket as a solid 'value' for genre addicts.

Not one of Arnold's best movies but certainly above average compared to the many flops he contributed to over the years as an action star.The film is a standard mob-action plot where Schwarzenegger plays Joseph Brenner, a former FBI agent who lost his job and whose son was killed by mobsters.  Brenner now works as a sheriff in some rural town and is approached by an old FBI pal named Max Keller (Robert Davi) who comes to him with an offer to reinstate him into the FBI if he helps bring down two big mafia leaders named Patrovita (Sam Wannamaker) and Rocca (Paul Shenar): the same leaders who were responsible for killing his son.  Going undercover, Joseph Brenner gets the mobsters to fight each other until the final showdown.I don't understand why other reviewers have such a low opinion of this film: it's actually quite good.  In my mind, there are many other Arnold films that would fall into the below-average category of 2 or less stars long before this one; films such as 'Commando', 'Conan the Destroyer', and 'Red Sonja', to name a few.  If anyone thinks that 'Raw Deal' is on par or lower in quality than the latter films, then they should really study some film basics before writing any more reviews.In conclusion, I think this is one of Arnold's better movies and is worthy of either purchase or rental.

Thinking that this could restart his old career, Arnold agrees, and ends up in the middle of the turf war, trying not to be exposed and running afoul of the hood's chief lieutenant, played by Robert Davi.This movie is not groundbreaking, but solid and entertaining in its own way.

442010,A3EUSQCI8G8D8O,6304970447,"The 747 Gambit ""500,000 Scoville Units""","[14, 18]","Let's face it - schlock as an art form has its place in our culture. Schlock takes many forms, from formulaic teen comedies, weepy romantic `comedies' and the trying-to-be-serious-but-looking-positively-ridiculous hard-boiled cops `n' robbers movie.Raw Deal is the latter. Taken in a slightly different direction (and with an entirely different cast) the script might produce something dark, gripping, and ultimately rewarding. But watching John Irving's vision of Raw Deal is rewarding in its own way - lots and lots of unintentional laughs, not to mention a seemingly never-ending clatter of empty shell casings. If you like Ah-nuld pre- ""Eraser,"" when his characters were given more leeway to act like, well, a muscle-bound Austrian playing the John Wayne role without a hint of shame, Raw Deal is an outstanding film.As I said before, the plot could have been believable, but there's no real concern with reality here, and that works in the film's favor. The current Governor of California is a small-town sheriff in an unhappy marriage, having been removed from ""The Agency"" (gamely represented here by a super frumpy Darrin McGavin as some kind of rogue FBI boss named Shannon). Well, wouldn't you know it, Arnie's former boss loses a son to gangsters. To quote Mayor Quimby , ""Those wacky gangsters. What're ya gonna do?"" Well, Shannon decides to enlist the Terminator off the books to terminate those wacky gangsters.But the termination comes not in the ""Commando"" mold of seek-and-destroy, but in possibly the least logical way possible - Mr. Schwartzenegger goes undercover in the Chicago mob. I'm no organized crime expert, but I somehow get the sense that the mob, whether Italian, Chinese, or Russian, tends to recruit from within. Walk-ons must be extremely suspect, especially if they look like escapees from WWE Raw (or the WWF, during the time this film was shot). But the mob honchos accept him with open arms, and the rest of the film is Arnold knocking the mob down piece by piece from the inside.The film really shines in its cartoony portrayal of gun violence, where more rounds are fired per scene than in a comparable day in Iraq. Sometimes the bullets hit, and then get ready for mobsters falling off of cranes, mobsters falling down stairs, and mobsters blowing up inside their cars. My absolute favorite moment of the film comes towards the end. Arnold has just wasted an entire room of baddies, and is setting off in pursuit of the main bad guy. The main bad guy leaves one poor schmoe, let's call him `Gangster #37' at the staircase. Gangster #37 fumbles with his weapon and says something like ""Bring it on! I'm going to go crazy and kill you!"" Arnold just walks around the corner and wastes him. Well, at least Gangster #37's heart was in the right place.So, if you like Arnold, and you like the idea of the mob getting its comeuppance in a hail of gunfire, check out Raw Deal. You won't be disappointed.",3,A Classic From the Golden Age of Ah-nuld,1117324800,"05 29, 2005",2005,2935,"['Let', 'face', 'schlock', 'art', 'form', 'place', 'culture', 'Schlock', 'many', 'forms', 'formulaic', 'teen', 'comedies', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'trying-to-be-serious-but-looking-positively-ridiculous', 'hard-boiled', 'cops', 'n', 'robbers', 'movie.Raw', 'Deal', 'latter', 'Taken', 'slightly', 'different', 'direction', 'entirely', 'different', 'cast', 'script', 'might', 'produce', 'something', 'dark', 'gripping', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'watching', 'John', 'Irving', 'vision', 'Raw', 'Deal', 'rewarding', 'own', 'way', 'lots', 'lots', 'unintentional', 'laughs', 'not', 'mention', 'seemingly', 'never-ending', 'clatter', 'empty', 'shell', 'casings', 'like', 'Ah-nuld', 'pre-', 'Eraser', 'when', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'more', 'leeway', 'act', 'well', 'muscle-bound', 'Austrian', 'playing', 'John', 'Wayne', 'role', 'hint', 'shame', 'Raw', 'Deal', 'outstanding', 'film.As', 'said', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'believable', 'real', 'concern', 'reality', 'here', 'film', 'favor', 'current', 'Governor', 'California', 'small-town', 'sheriff', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'having', 'been', 'removed', 'Agency', 'gamely', 'represented', 'here', 'super', 'frumpy', 'Darrin', 'McGavin', 'kind', 'rogue', 'FBI', 'boss', 'named', 'Shannon', 'Well', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'Arnie', 'former', 'boss', 'son', 'gangsters', 'quote', 'Mayor', 'Quimby', 'wacky', 'gangsters', 'What', ""'re"", 'ya', 'gon', 'do', 'Well', 'Shannon', 'enlist', 'Terminator', 'books', 'terminate', 'wacky', 'gangsters.But', 'termination', 'not', 'Commando', 'mold', 'seek-and-destroy', 'possibly', 'least', 'logical', 'way', 'possible', 'Mr.', 'Schwartzenegger', 'undercover', 'Chicago', 'mob', ""'m"", 'organized', 'crime', 'expert', 'somehow', 'get', 'sense', 'mob', 'Italian', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'recruit', 'Walk-ons', 'must', 'be', 'extremely', 'suspect', 'especially', 'look', 'escapees', 'WWE', 'Raw', 'WWF', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mob', 'honchos', 'accept', 'open', 'arms', 'rest', 'film', 'Arnold', 'knocking', 'mob', 'down', 'piece', 'piece', 'inside.The', 'film', 'really', 'cartoony', 'portrayal', 'gun', 'violence', 'where', 'more', 'rounds', 'are', 'fired', 'scene', 'comparable', 'day', 'Iraq', 'Sometimes', 'bullets', 'hit', 'then', 'get', 'ready', 'mobsters', 'falling', 'cranes', 'mobsters', 'falling', 'down', 'stairs', 'mobsters', 'blowing', 'up', 'cars', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'moment', 'film', 'end', 'Arnold', 'just', 'wasted', 'entire', 'room', 'baddies', 'setting', 'off', 'pursuit', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'main', 'bad', 'guy', 'one', 'poor', 'schmoe', 'let', 'call', 'Gangster', '37', 'staircase', 'Gangster', '37', 'fumbles', 'weapon', 'something', 'Bring', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'crazy', 'kill', 'Arnold', 'just', 'walks', 'corner', 'Well', 'least', 'Gangster', '37', 'heart', 'was', 'right', 'place.So', 'like', 'Arnold', 'like', 'idea', 'mob', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'hail', 'gunfire', 'check', 'out', 'Raw', 'Deal', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
