I have waited for an official video release for a long time and now it's here. They play almost everything a long time fan would want to hear, they sound great and the video is shot extremely well. What more could one ask for? Buy this and discover a great band at the top of their game.",5,Classic Trouble show,1208390400,"04 17, 2008",2008,362,"['saw', 'Trouble', 'twice', 'Manic', 'Frustration', 'tour', 'were', 'amazing', 'have', 'waited', 'official', 'video', 'release', 'long', 'time', 'now', 'here', 'play', 'almost', 'everything', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'would', 'want', 'hear', 'sound', 'great', 'video', 'shot', 'extremely', 'well', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'one', 'ask', 'Buy', 'discover', 'great', 'band', 'top', 'game']",N/A

1113969,A1E8S9L3B455N3,B000XCZCGW,Samuel G. Powell,"[4, 4]","This DVD does nor disppoint in any way.  Trouble blew me away the first time I heard the Manic Frustration CD, and I couldn't imagine anyone pulling off anything that bone-crushing heavy live.  They succeed.  I was somewhat wary at first, because they're a fairly obscure act and I'd only heard three albums - Manic Frustration, Plastic Green Head (which grew on me til it was a favorite) and their eponymous def jam album, which for some reason hasn't caught my fancy yet.  But everything on this DVD is as raw, crushing and passionate as the best from Manic Frustration or Plastic Green Head.  There's not any sense in doing a song-by-song review; everything here is pure metal/hard rock with a psychedelic flavor that assaults the ears from first to last.  The extras are simple, but the interview is thorough and lucid, with a complete album-by-album examination of their career.  And tone - tone - tone.  Franklin and Wartell are a guitar duo that was made to work together, and they share duties quite evenly throughout.  So if you liked Manic Frustration or Plastic Green Head at all, this will blow you away.",5,The world's most underrated metal act,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,1116,"['DVD', 'disppoint', 'way', 'Trouble', 'blew', 'away', 'first', 'time', 'heard', 'Manic', 'Frustration', 'CD', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'anyone', 'pulling', 'off', 'anything', 'bone-crushing', 'heavy', 'live', 'succeed', 'was', 'somewhat', 'wary', 'first', ""'re"", 'fairly', 'obscure', 'act', ""'d"", 'only', 'heard', 'three', 'albums', 'Manic', 'Frustration', 'Plastic', 'Green', 'Head', 'grew', 'was', 'favorite', 'eponymous', 'def', 'jam', 'album', 'reason', ""n't"", 'caught', 'fancy', 'yet', 'everything', 'DVD', 'raw', 'crushing', 'passionate', 'best', 'Manic', 'Frustration', 'Plastic', 'Green', 'Head', 'not', 'sense', 'doing', 'song-by-song', 'review', 'everything', 'here', 'pure', 'metal/hard', 'rock', 'psychedelic', 'flavor', 'ears', 'first', 'last', 'extras', 'are', 'simple', 'interview', 'thorough', 'lucid', 'complete', 'album-by-album', 'examination', 'career', 'tone', 'tone', 'tone', 'Franklin', 'Wartell', 'are', 'guitar', 'duo', 'was', 'made', 'work', 'together', 'share', 'quite', 'evenly', 'So', 'liked', 'Manic', 'Frustration', 'Plastic', 'Green', 'Head', 'will', 'blow', 'away']",N/A
