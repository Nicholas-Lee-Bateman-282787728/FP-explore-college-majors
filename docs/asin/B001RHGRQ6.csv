It's commercial-free. The theme song is great.Cons: It's black and white cinematography. The plot is simple for each individual episode (we all know the main plot). Whoever produced the DVD did not put the episodes in the proper order (One character will die, and then appear for the very first time 3 episodes later).There are over 100 episodes for the entire show, 39 per season.",5,"Very well done, considering the time it was produced",1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,519,"['really', 'series', 'are', '39', 'episodes', '5-10', 'money', 'ca', ""n't"", 'beat', 'English', 'accents', 'are', 'entertaining', 'commercial-free', 'theme', 'song', 'great.Cons', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'simple', 'individual', 'episode', 'know', 'main', 'plot', 'produced', 'DVD', 'did', 'not', 'put', 'episodes', 'proper', 'order', 'One', 'character', 'will', 'die', 'then', 'appear', 'very', 'first', 'time', '3', 'episodes', 'later', 'are', '100', 'episodes', 'entire', 'show', '39', 'season']",Adventures of Robin Hood-Complete 3rd Season

1233164,AW4EHPFTNGSM8,B001RHGRQ6,Ivanhoe,"[0, 0]","The Robin Hood series for me and others who grew up in the 50's and early 60's is just a great rememberance of fun times.  The series today may seem a bit contrived or even hokey, but the ensemble cast with same members playing different parts from week to week was little noticed then.  If a colorized version was available, I would have given it 5 stars.  The ability of British cast to keep the often poor scripts, bad story ideas and direction interesting and often exciting is a tribute to their ability as actors.  Many came from Shakespearian theater and some went on to film work in England.  I recommend this series to those who love the Robin Saga, those who remember the 50's and 60's and anyone who are curious about television's early days.",4,Great series for those who remember . . . even those who don't!,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,753,"['Robin', 'Hood', 'series', 'others', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '50', 'early', '60', 'just', 'great', 'rememberance', 'fun', 'times', 'series', 'today', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'contrived', 'even', 'hokey', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'same', 'members', 'playing', 'different', 'parts', 'week', 'week', 'was', 'little', 'noticed', 'then', 'colorized', 'version', 'was', 'available', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'ability', 'British', 'cast', 'keep', 'often', 'poor', 'scripts', 'bad', 'story', 'ideas', 'direction', 'interesting', 'often', 'exciting', 'tribute', 'ability', 'actors', 'Many', 'came', 'Shakespearian', 'theater', 'went', 'film', 'work', 'England', 'recommend', 'series', 'who', 'love', 'Robin', 'Saga', 'who', 'remember', '50', '60', 'anyone', 'who', 'are', 'curious', 'television', 'early', 'days']",Adventures of Robin Hood-Complete 3rd Season

1233167,A1MA0TK6F7GBZY,B001RHGRQ6,Robin LaVair,"[3, 3]","I hated when VHS replaced Beta but enjoied the price of vhs tapes.  When DVD took the place of VHS tapes I started to feel the same way till I saw how much a person can get of shows that are not on tv any more. Robin Hood with Richard Greene is one of these. I saw these shows when I was a kid  but saw very little of it after that. The first time I got to see it again was the peaced-togather shows on VHS of Robin Hood the Movie and Quest for the Crown. They were good in their own way but there is nothing like seeing the original episodes. I got the three seasons that Mill Creek put out and hope they put out the forth season soon. Mill Creek has done a good job on the DVD's from the picture to sound. There are no extras but that is not what I look for. I wish I could say it brings back memeries but all I can remenber is that I saw these shows and liked them then and that I still like seeing them now on DVD. If you think because it is in black & white it's not worth looking at you are missing out. The shows didn't stick to ""rob from the rich-give to the poor"" but took time to show the merry men having their own troubles. It didn't always show them singing,like the title song says, but it was always up beat. These DVD's are worth adding to any collecting. I also like the DVD sets because my daughter and granddaughters watch it with me and like the Adventures of Robin Hood.",5,Robin Hood still going.,1241308800,"05 3, 2009",2009,1391,"['hated', 'when', 'VHS', 'replaced', 'Beta', 'enjoied', 'price', 'vhs', 'tapes', 'When', 'DVD', 'took', 'place', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'started', 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'saw', 'how', 'much', 'person', 'can', 'get', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'tv', 'more', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'one', 'saw', 'shows', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'saw', 'very', 'little', 'first', 'time', 'got', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'peaced-togather', 'shows', 'VHS', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Movie', 'Quest', 'Crown', 'were', 'good', 'own', 'way', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'original', 'episodes', 'got', 'three', 'seasons', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'put', 'out', 'hope', 'put', 'out', 'forth', 'season', 'soon', 'Mill', 'Creek', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'DVD', 'picture', 'sound', 'are', 'extras', 'not', 'what', 'look', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'back', 'memeries', 'can', 'remenber', 'saw', 'shows', 'liked', 'then', 'still', 'seeing', 'now', 'DVD', 'think', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'worth', 'looking', 'are', 'missing', 'out', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'rob', 'rich-give', 'poor', 'took', 'time', 'show', 'merry', 'men', 'having', 'own', 'troubles', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'show', 'singing', 'title', 'song', 'was', 'always', 'up', 'beat', 'DVD', 'are', 'worth', 'adding', 'collecting', 'also', 'DVD', 'sets', 'daughter', 'granddaughters', 'watch', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood']",Adventures of Robin Hood-Complete 3rd Season
