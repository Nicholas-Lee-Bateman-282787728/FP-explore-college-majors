I like music with a clean sound and a hard edge sometimes,and this show delivers. ""Shayla"" and ""Union City Blue"" really stand out. Not a perfect show, but damn close. Debbie Harrys voice was awesome and at times seemed to sing as if she was giving it all she possibly could. At times it was filmed as if you were standing next to her on stage. Great crowd. The interaction of the audience and Debbie is genuinely symbiotic. I think this was billed as Blondies comeback concert in 1999, and they really did good. I have a feeling this was a very emotional concert for many people and you can feel it. The sound quality is nice, but you have to bring the treble down a little.

This is a mature Blondie performing exceptionally well!!! Debbie Harry, the Band, the Town Hall Auditorium, the atmosphere, and the crowd are all really into it, making this one GREAT concert DVD!!!Blondie was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame during 2006!!!This concert dvd was filmed after their late 90's release of an album full of new material (I can't remember the name, but it's the one that contained the hit ""Maria"")! With the release of ""Maria"", Blondie had a #1 hit in the U.K. during the 70's, the 80's, and with ""Maria"" in the 90's!!!They are certainly a great band and Debbie Harry is an outstanding performer!!! This concert DVD proves it!!! The song set consists of 16 songs, all are great. Some highlights, I especially liked include:""Dreaming""""Hanging on the Telephone""""Call Me""""X Offender""""Screaming Skin""""Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room""""Atomic""""Forgive and Forget""""One Way or Another""""Shayla/Union City Blue""""In the Flesh""""Heart of Glass""""Sunday Girl""""Rapture""Plus, it contains a bonus video of ""Nothing is real but the Girl"".This is a great one in my opinion, if you're a Blondie fan this is a ""must have"" concert dvd. If you're not a Blondie fan, buy one and watch it, and I think you'll like it. Debbie is full of enthusiasm and this is a ""feel-good"" concert to watch.

864119,AY12DBB0U420B,B00069FKYQ,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I first saw Blondie in 1978 when they were on as an opening act at the Open Air Theater at San Diego State University. I enjoyed them very much, but their volume was set too high, a characteristic shared by many young and insecure bands. Strange, I can remember Blondie but I can't remember the main act. Well, that just goes to show who I appreciated the most.In any case, I was browsing the DVD bargain rack and found ""Blondie Live,"" a DVD of a 1999 concert at New York Town Hall. I had to have it, of course. It's a well done production and I enjoyed it very much. The photography, in particular, is quite well done. It varies from shots of the crowd to tight close-ups of the performers, particularly Debbie Harry. Debbie and the excellent drummer seemed to capture most of the camera work, and they earned it. I had gripes about the sound. It's just not very good. I'm sure their equipment is good, but the total sound recorded included the room acoustics. The sound was such that listening to and understanding the lyrics was difficult. At one point, Debbie Harry made an announcement at the mic with a silent band and you could just barely make it out. The sound was that bad. It's nothing unusual, I might add. I can remember going to concerts at the San Diego Sports Arena and having my ears ringing but not being able to understand the song lyrics. A lot of DVD concerts have this difficulty with room acoustics.In any case, the concert was quite enjoyable. Debby Harry was bigger and a bit more lumpy than I remembered but her voice was in fine form and I just loved hearing ""One Way or Another"" and ""Heart of Glass."" Excellent! The band was active and animated and put on an excellent show, particularly the drummer. The song list was longer than on the DVD cover and not in the same order. The audience, including people of all ages, obviously enjoyed the show. Well, it was a good show!Gary Peterson",4,Excellent Concert and Quite Enjoyable.,1338163200,"05 28, 2012",2012,1913,"['first', 'saw', 'Blondie', '1978', 'when', 'were', 'opening', 'act', 'Open', 'Air', 'Theater', 'San', 'Diego', 'State', 'University', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'volume', 'was', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'characteristic', 'shared', 'many', 'young', 'insecure', 'bands', 'Strange', 'can', 'remember', 'Blondie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'main', 'act', 'Well', 'just', 'show', 'who', 'appreciated', 'most.In', 'case', 'was', 'browsing', 'DVD', 'bargain', 'rack', 'found', 'Blondie', 'Live', 'DVD', '1999', 'concert', 'New', 'York', 'Town', 'Hall', 'had', 'have', 'course', 'well', 'done', 'production', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'much', 'photography', 'particular', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'shots', 'crowd', 'tight', 'close-ups', 'performers', 'particularly', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'Debbie', 'excellent', 'drummer', 'seemed', 'capture', 'most', 'camera', 'work', 'earned', 'had', 'gripes', 'sound', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', ""'m"", 'sure', 'equipment', 'good', 'total', 'sound', 'recorded', 'included', 'room', 'acoustics', 'sound', 'was', 'such', 'listening', 'understanding', 'lyrics', 'was', 'difficult', 'one', 'point', 'Debbie', 'Harry', 'made', 'announcement', 'mic', 'silent', 'band', 'could', 'just', 'barely', 'make', 'out', 'sound', 'was', 'bad', 'nothing', 'unusual', 'might', 'add', 'can', 'remember', 'going', 'concerts', 'San', 'Diego', 'Sports', 'Arena', 'having', 'ears', 'ringing', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'understand', 'song', 'lyrics', 'lot', 'DVD', 'concerts', 'have', 'difficulty', 'room', 'acoustics.In', 'case', 'concert', 'was', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'Debby', 'Harry', 'was', 'bigger', 'bit', 'more', 'lumpy', 'remembered', 'voice', 'was', 'fine', 'form', 'just', 'loved', 'hearing', 'One', 'Way', 'Heart', 'Glass', 'Excellent', 'band', 'was', 'active', 'animated', 'put', 'excellent', 'show', 'particularly', 'drummer', 'song', 'list', 'was', 'longer', 'DVD', 'cover', 'not', 'same', 'order', 'audience', 'including', 'people', 'ages', 'obviously', 'enjoyed', 'show', 'Well', 'was', 'good', 'show', 'Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

Hey Deb, when you put your shoes on-the toes go in first. About 10 minutes into the concert, she sweat like I did on my honeymoon. I have never written a review like this-a worn look, but great music. Maybe I should not NEEDLE her about her look. Maybe we should TRACK her progress in future concerts.

864121,A2EOCDPEG6K1WQ,B00069FKYQ,Mark Lahren,"[2, 3]","Since I got this DVD in the mail 2 weeks ago, I have watched it from beginning to end every single evening. That's 14 nights in a row. While I'm at work, I'm singing to myself songs from this performance, especially ""Screaming Skin"", which snuck up on me and surprised me how good it is. The entire performance is absolutely first-rate, and it's fun to watch this great group back together again. And Deborah Harry does appear to be slightly nervous at the beginning, but then she just flat-out blooms during the concert. She starts out in fine form, but around the time those sunglasses come off, she transforms into a lovely creature you can't take your eyes off, and her vocals are much stronger than I had anticipated. I cannot think of a better word for it: She blooms, right in front of your eyes.The rest of the band is a pleasure to watch also, but Deborah Harry just steals the show. I never paid much attention to her before, mostly because I've never seen them live, and my exposure has been almost solely to the audio Blondie. Which was great, but I honestly never really realized how beautiful Deborah Harry is. And she's totally got the moves down. Try not to melt when she smiles.Clem Burke: One of my two favorite drummers ever. Fast and creative, he never misses a beat and is a wonder to watch at work.Chris Stein: A very laid-back kinda guy, his guitar work may not sound remarkable, but it is very distinctive, and is a basic factor in Blondie's sound.Jimmy Destri: Also a distinctive sound on the keyboards, and as one of the founding members, had a hand in writing some of the great songs that made Blondie who they are.Leigh Foxx: Great bass work, and a very nice solo.Paul Carbonara: Solid guitarist, some great leads.Video: 4:3 aspect ratio. Being as this was originally a television special, this is to be expected, as is the radio station logo that appears on the wall.Very good quality. Nicely lit stage, and a relaxed editing job that puts you where you want to be. Some of these new concert videos coming out are edited so quickly, that they cause a headache, and won't let you focus. I'm happy to report that doesn't happen here. Video quality also excellent. Nice, clear picture. Also, special mention to the camera operators, as they knew exactly where to be at exactly the right time. Clearly professional work throughout.Audio: Very good for a live concert, but not excellent. Nothing bothersome, but there were some very minor things. For instance, I'd have liked to hear Chris' guitar a bit better. And the rest of the instruments were hard to distinguish from each other. Deborah's voice, however, comes through loud and clear, as does Clem's drums.Overall: A must-have if you're remotely interested in this band. Tonight will be the first night I have not watched it since I got it. On the other hand, maybe I'll wait another day...",5,Top-notch and first-rate.,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",2006,2871,"['got', 'DVD', 'mail', '2', 'weeks', 'ago', 'have', 'watched', 'beginning', 'end', 'single', 'evening', '14', 'nights', 'row', ""'m"", 'work', ""'m"", 'singing', 'myself', 'songs', 'performance', 'especially', 'Screaming', 'Skin', 'snuck', 'up', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'entire', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'first-rate', 'fun', 'watch', 'great', 'group', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'appear', 'be', 'slightly', 'nervous', 'beginning', 'then', 'just', 'flat-out', 'blooms', 'concert', 'out', 'fine', 'form', 'time', 'sunglasses', 'come', 'off', 'lovely', 'creature', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'vocals', 'are', 'much', 'stronger', 'had', 'anticipated', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'better', 'word', 'blooms', 'right', 'front', 'eyes.The', 'rest', 'band', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'also', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'just', 'show', 'never', 'paid', 'much', 'attention', 'before', 'mostly', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'live', 'exposure', 'been', 'almost', 'solely', 'audio', 'Blondie', 'Which', 'was', 'great', 'honestly', 'never', 'really', 'realized', 'how', 'beautiful', 'Deborah', 'Harry', 'totally', 'got', 'moves', 'down', 'Try', 'not', 'melt', 'when', 'smiles.Clem', 'Burke', 'One', 'two', 'favorite', 'drummers', 'ever', 'Fast', 'creative', 'never', 'beat', 'wonder', 'watch', 'work.Chris', 'Stein', 'very', 'laid-back', 'kinda', 'guy', 'guitar', 'work', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'remarkable', 'very', 'distinctive', 'basic', 'factor', 'Blondie', 'sound.Jimmy', 'Destri', 'Also', 'distinctive', 'sound', 'keyboards', 'one', 'founding', 'members', 'had', 'hand', 'writing', 'great', 'songs', 'made', 'Blondie', 'who', 'are.Leigh', 'Foxx', 'Great', 'bass', 'work', 'very', 'nice', 'solo.Paul', 'Carbonara', 'Solid', 'guitarist', 'great', 'leads.Video', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'Being', 'was', 'originally', 'television', 'special', 'be', 'expected', 'radio', 'station', 'logo', 'wall.Very', 'good', 'quality', 'Nicely', 'lit', 'stage', 'relaxed', 'editing', 'job', 'where', 'want', 'be', 'new', 'concert', 'videos', 'coming', 'out', 'are', 'edited', 'so', 'quickly', 'cause', 'headache', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'focus', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', ""n't"", 'happen', 'here', 'Video', 'quality', 'also', 'excellent', 'Nice', 'clear', 'picture', 'Also', 'special', 'mention', 'camera', 'operators', 'knew', 'exactly', 'where', 'be', 'exactly', 'right', 'time', 'Clearly', 'professional', 'work', 'throughout.Audio', 'Very', 'good', 'live', 'concert', 'not', 'excellent', 'Nothing', 'bothersome', 'were', 'very', 'minor', 'things', 'instance', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'Chris', 'guitar', 'bit', 'better', 'rest', 'instruments', 'were', 'hard', 'distinguish', 'other', 'Deborah', 'voice', 'however', 'loud', 'clear', 'Clem', 'drums.Overall', 'must-have', ""'re"", 'remotely', 'interested', 'band', 'Tonight', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'night', 'have', 'not', 'watched', 'got', 'other', 'hand', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'day']",N/A
864122,A1TJJ7W8SF75D,B00069FKYQ,Timothy T. Ward,"[5, 6]","This was considered a reunion concert of sorts being it was Blondie's first U.S. show in about 17 years since disbanding in the early 80's. Upon the release of their reunion album, No Exit, in early 1999, Blondie deliver a top quality performace. What stands out most of all is witnessing how improved they sound as a live act compared to their heyday. Clem Burke plays heavy with this show, as he always has, but the whole band show a great chemistry playing together, while Debbie's voice has grown better with age-rich and smoky, but still carries the clear, pop vocals that marry sexuality and innocence. The exceptional performaces in this show are ""Shayla,"" which then leads into an explosive version of ""Union City Blue,"" also one of the best performances I've ever seen of ""Rapture,"" followed by Harry emerged in her punk delivery of ""Rip Her to Shreds."" The audience is more than receptive and Blondie give thanks with an amazing encore consisting of ""One Way Or Another,"" and ""Heart of Glass."" The set list is also packed with hits, but the track that seems totally out of place is in the middle by way of ""Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room,"" a dreary jazz number included on the No Exit album.
