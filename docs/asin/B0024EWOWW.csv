Not much difference of what is going on today! This really was quite a defining period of our American history. They actually made these killers ""special celebrities"" at the time. Guess it was the mood of the country. They put them up on pedestals. These killers have been romanticzied in movies and when they ""get theirs"" in the end - and they always do - we feel sorry for them. Poor, misundersood little darlings who wouldn't think twice about mowing down your mother or father if they got in the way! A sign of the times. Good video for history buffs and for those who want to reminisce about the 1930's and the great depression - educational. Fast paced, like the old newsreels they would show at the theatres.

It even chronicles some criminals that I've never heard of. It's a very well produced DVD like any other history channel release. As a bonus it also has the a&e biography of Bonnie and Clyde.

1249678,AFAGGH1YKK4NP,B0024EWOWW,Geoffrey C. Newman,"[0, 0]","This documentary, chronicling the Mid-West Bank Robbing spree of the 1930's was released to coincide with the release of the movie ""PUBLIC ENEMIES"" starring Johnny Depp. As such, it seems a bit hasty in it's assembly and is severely lacking in the whole story.The documentary opens with the June 7th, 1933 ""Kansas City Massacre"" in which an FBI agent, three policemen, and a federal prisoner are killed and more or less ends with the death of John Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago on July 22nd, 1934.The documentary primarily focuses on Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, ""Baby Face"" Nelson, and ""Machine Gun"" Kelly. My biggest gripe is that it doesn't even mention ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd or ""Ma"" Barker's sons or Alvin Karpis, who were just as important in that era. Also the re-enactments are a little shoddy and sometimes innacurate in their staging.It's a nice introduction to that era but crime buffs would be better served by reading Bryan Burroughs book ""Public Enemies"" upon which the Johnny Depp movie is based. It's a more comprehensive and accurate rendering of that time.",3,Nice documentary... but lacking the overall facts,1332633600,"03 25, 2012",2012,1088,"['documentary', 'chronicling', 'Mid-West', 'Bank', 'Robbing', 'spree', '1930', 'was', 'released', 'coincide', 'release', 'movie', 'PUBLIC', 'ENEMIES', 'starring', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'such', 'bit', 'hasty', 'assembly', 'severely', 'lacking', 'whole', 'story.The', 'documentary', 'June', '7th', '1933', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Massacre', 'FBI', 'agent', 'three', 'policemen', 'federal', 'prisoner', 'are', 'killed', 'more', 'less', 'ends', 'death', 'John', 'Dillinger', 'Biograph', 'Theater', 'Chicago', 'July', '22nd', '1934.The', 'documentary', 'primarily', 'Dillinger', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Baby', 'Face', 'Nelson', 'Machine', 'Gun', 'Kelly', 'biggest', 'gripe', ""n't"", 'even', 'mention', 'Pretty', 'Boy', 'Floyd', 'Ma', 'Barker', 'sons', 'Alvin', 'Karpis', 'who', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'era', 'Also', 're-enactments', 'are', 'little', 'shoddy', 'sometimes', 'innacurate', 'staging.It', 'nice', 'introduction', 'era', 'crime', 'buffs', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'reading', 'Bryan', 'Burroughs', 'book', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'movie', 'based', 'more', 'comprehensive', 'accurate', 'rendering', 'time']",Crime Wave: 18 Months Of Mayhem

The outlaws run wild, outwitting most state cops with their technologically advanced weapons, bulletproof vests, and superior rides!This documentary provides a riveting and explicit account during the gangster years, thus giving rise to America's first national police force: The FBI. It's a fumbling and humbling beginning. Its special agents learn on the job; lawyers and accounting degree holders with limited or no law enforcement knowledge. However, in the end, they succeed in bringing down America's most notorious criminals.It's an enthralling, dramatic, and educational docudrama--an excellent production.
