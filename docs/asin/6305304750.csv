459046,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6305304750,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 5]","Six days.  Four hours. A Native American Kevin Costner.  Graham Greene playing his only clich&eacute; Hollywood persona.  Finally, it is done.  The ""it"" being referred to is the epic 1990 Oscar sweeping film by Kevin Costner, entitled ""Dances with Wolves"".  My first encounter with this film was when I was very young, enjoying an overnight with a friend, falling asleep to the bountiful landscapes that seemed to go on forever.  It was a film that was hailed a masterpiece by critics, while allowing Costner to finally be able to pick and choose his repetitive roles over the next two decades.  Alas, picking it up, watching it now in its modern high-definition glory - it is still a beautiful film, but it is not perfection.  As mentioned in the first line of this review, Costner's film is not for the amateur film viewer - it is a film that forces you to put on your Buffalo skin, open a fire, and settle in for a very cold winter.  Unbeknownst to me, there is a ""director's cut"" of the film that now ranges nearly four hours.  That is what I settled into and doubtably now, upon my completion, should be called - Sits with Costner Epic.Hollywood loves the epic.  It doesn't matter much these days what the topic surrounds, as long as there are long picture-esque images of Americana (or some other country), coupled with a tender moment, a blasting score, and sympathy towards anything - than the epic will reign supreme.  For further examples of this see ""Braveheart"", ""The English Patient"", or even Costner's second epic outing ""The Postman"", and while not all of these were Oscar winners, the critics went easy, the crowds faced the screens, and people were happy.Not me.  Not this time.""Dances with Wolves"" is beautiful.  The detailed conversion on my new Blu player is and was phenomenal.  The individual blades of grass stood tall and at moments I felt as if I was right there with Costner as he chased Two-Socks, or crossed the sweeping frontier.  Costner's film, if anything, gave a modern technology country a view of a world that nearly feels fictional.  No computers, no cell phones, nothing facing you except nature, and the power of Mother Earth.  Costner captures this feeling with perfection.  Not only does he have the time to cultivate this sensation, but he uses both audio and visual references to assist with his imagery.  There was no doubt in my mind that Costner felt dedicated to this project that his creative eye wasn't at the peak of its existence.  His passion bled through the film, giving us that moment when ""Dances with Wolves"" transforms from Hollywood project to Costner's dream come true.  For that I applaud Costner for following his heart and creating a visual treat that goes beyond your average film.While Costner's imagery stands powerfully next to any great director's work, it is the overall story that ultimately holds back the rest of the film.  Costner is obviously comfortable behind the camera, but it is his work within the film that feels a bit repetitive and clich&eacute;.  Costner is not Lieutenant Dunbar.  While he is the imaginative force behind the story, he cannot seem to tackle the character itself.  Costner never quite transforms himself into something we haven't seen.  Perhaps watching it during its release would have been a different story, but in 2008, one watches Costner be Costner only in Native American headwear.  The scenes in this film where he first encounters the sounds of the frontier, or later when he finds an unseen love, were utterly dishonest.  Costner was Costner; there was no other way to see it.  The only parts that glimmered with a possible character were the beginning run through the barrage of open bullets, and the violent reintroduction to the white culture near the end were satisfactory, but for just a few short moments.  Costner needed to tell us more about Dunbar, give us either flashbacks of his life or his reason for making decisions.  The voiceover wasn't convincing enough as a conscious to give us true rhyme or reason.  Those puppy dog eyes that Costner blasted any chance he had never gave us the torment that obviously dwelled within this man.  There was a reason for his possible suicide attempt and escape into the wild.  With no mention of family or history, it is difficult to understand Costner's why.With Costner misleading us through the mapping of this film, it was left up to the other players to demonstrate a goal at the end of this four hour tunnel.  This semi-happened with Graham Greene's character and Catherine McCormack's role, two people forced into clich&eacute; roles that they have played time and time again.  This time they pulled it off well, but I just didn't believe them.  Greene plays this character in every film he has ever been in, while McCormack's character was a cross between Helen Keller and Pocahontas.  Not to sound offensive to Native American's, I was happy to see a sympathetic view of them via Costner's eyes, but it felt used.  Hardship seemed to be an unknown word to this tribe.  Costner was able to walk on in, build relationships, not worry about food rations, and easily jump right into the culture without any worry.  There was never a moment where I found myself saying, ""Ah, is he going to make it?"" - the simplicity of it all seemed faked and merely in place for emotions sake.Finally, the question of time has to be approached.  Did Costner need four hours to tell this story?  Alas, no.  Using the beautiful landscape he merely bought time, aka filler, to push his simplistic tale from average story to epic.  In two hours, Costner could have pushed the emotional button further and really dedicated himself to his character.  At pushing 245 minutes, we felt as if we lost the character of Dunbar after the first hour and a half.  With such a broad canvas, not enough was dedicated to the right parts.  Costner's relationships with the other characters were pushed so far that a sense of apathy was built.  Any cares that we had were brushed away at the two and a half hour mark.Overall, Costner's film probably deserved the Oscars at the time - but it currently doesn't stand alone as a modern masterpiece.  Costner misjudged this film pushing the framing too far and loosing the central focus.  His character of Dunbar seemed more like an imitation of Droopy Dog in the frontier, instead of a stylized representation of a true soul.  Costner does powerfully show us a sympathetic view of the Native American culture during the time of its downfall, but with such an epic nature I expected it to carry more realism.  The Sioux has danger, they had fears, and they had their own to worry about, but once Costner appeared we saw none of that.  Costner was so excited about learning about them, about communicating with them, that we never quite had the chance to see their world.  Costner must be given credit for his eye in this film.  While his directing skills were not as I anticipated, his visual eye was superb.  Images that may never be captured again were detailed throughout, giving us the view of an epic - although lacking the other parts.  ""Dances with Wolves"" is worth viewing at least once, but another four hours could not be done by this critic even if life depended on it.Grade: **  out of *****",3,Was the wolf's name

This version is closer to what Costner orignally envisioned, and the orignal team was initmately involved in producing it.  The movie was edited down to 181 minutes at the order of the studio/distibutors.  They felt people wouldn't sit through a four hour movie.  Who knows, they may have been right.  Besides, a shorter length means you can run it more times and sell more tickets.  Since the studio was gambling big with this movie (no one guessed it would be the monster hit it was) already, they probably wouldn't have released it at all at its original length.This version  has a differnt feel to it than the theatrical release.  It explains more (like why the fort was abandoned when Dunbar arrived) and in some places it's darker.  The Sioux are not all purely good.  The scene where the Indians catch the buffalo hunters and Dunbar's reaction to what's going on (in the extended edition) is very, very powerful.  We are quite fortunate that we at home can see both versions of the film.  BTW, this wasn't because of DVD, both the long  and theatrical versions were released in VHS letterbox.It's interesting to compare and contrast the theatrical and Extended versions.

While the actual story is a tad revisionistic, it is very entertaining.  But before I get into this blu-ray release, I want to address an issue that I am surprised most critics did not catch onto.  Dances With Wolves is the movie that James Cameron adapted to do Avatar.  They are essentially the same stories, with the same character arcs and overall themes.  I won't go blow for blow, but watch them back to back and tell me that Avatar is not a rip-off of Dances With Wolves.  Now, this is not a review to bash Avatar, because I actually liked it.  But I am surprised how much praise Cameron gets for the movie without acknowledging how much it owes to Dances With Wolves.  Maybe he DID rip off Terminator from Harlon Ellison after all.Anyway, I am usually not a big fan of extended cuts recently, because they tend to tack on a couple of minutes of crappy outtakes that were edited out for a reason.  Not so with Dances With Wolves.  One of the biggest revelations of this cut is you find out what happened to the soldiers of Fort Sedgwick before Lt. Dunbar made it there.  While the original theatrical cut works with an odd sense of mystery at the beginning, this is also an interesting addition adding an unnecessary, but fun cut that solves the mystery.  The other big addition for me was the soliloquey that Dunbar makes in his journal after they find the slaughtered buffalo.  He makes a mention that he could not sleep with them and there were no looks of blame.  That never sat well with me until I saw this extended version which puts that scene into context.  It turns out the scouts found the white guys who killed the buffalo, scalped and slaughtered them, and the dance you saw around the campfire was celebrating that.  It was, to me, a very important piece of the puzzle and I finally understood what Costner meant in that scene.  It is also a pivotal moment in Dunbar's development as he becomes separated from the Whahchichoo and becomes a different individual to the tribe and to himself.  He is becoming a man who does not fit anywhere.  This is a very key moment that, with this small addition in the film, makes the movie so much deeper and Dunbar's character arc much more compelling and real.This is one of the few movies that used their cut scenes to great effect, similar to the extended cuts of the Lord of the Rings.  They are great for superfans, but also great for the regular viewer.  Yes, most of the cuts were obviously cut out for a reason, and for the most part, are unnecessary to the core story.  But if you like the story as much as I do, there are so many more delightful details to experience.",5,"See the ""real"" Avatar",1326326400,"01 12, 2012",2012,2735,"['Dances', 'Wolves', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'finest', 'film', 'date', 'down', 'Nothing', 'else', 'close', 'actual', 'story', 'tad', 'revisionistic', 'very', 'entertaining', 'get', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'want', 'address', 'issue', 'am', 'surprised', 'most', 'critics', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'movie', 'James', 'Cameron', 'adapted', 'do', 'Avatar', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'stories', 'same', 'character', 'arcs', 'overall', 'themes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'blow', 'blow', 'watch', 'back', 'back', 'tell', 'Avatar', 'not', 'rip-off', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Now', 'not', 'review', 'bash', 'Avatar', 'actually', 'liked', 'am', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'praise', 'Cameron', 'movie', 'acknowledging', 'how', 'much', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Maybe', 'DID', 'rip', 'off', 'Terminator', 'Harlon', 'Ellison', 'all.Anyway', 'am', 'usually', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'extended', 'cuts', 'recently', 'tend', 'tack', 'couple', 'minutes', 'crappy', 'outtakes', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'reason', 'Not', 'so', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'One', 'biggest', 'revelations', 'cut', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'soldiers', 'Fort', 'Sedgwick', 'Lt.', 'Dunbar', 'made', 'there', 'original', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'odd', 'sense', 'mystery', 'beginning', 'also', 'interesting', 'addition', 'adding', 'unnecessary', 'fun', 'cut', 'mystery', 'other', 'big', 'addition', 'was', 'soliloquey', 'Dunbar', 'journal', 'find', 'slaughtered', 'buffalo', 'mention', 'could', 'not', 'sleep', 'were', 'looks', 'blame', 'never', 'sat', 'well', 'saw', 'extended', 'version', 'scene', 'context', 'out', 'scouts', 'found', 'white', 'guys', 'who', 'killed', 'buffalo', 'scalped', 'slaughtered', 'dance', 'saw', 'campfire', 'was', 'celebrating', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'finally', 'understood', 'what', 'Costner', 'meant', 'scene', 'also', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'Dunbar', 'development', 'separated', 'Whahchichoo', 'different', 'individual', 'tribe', 'becoming', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'fit', 'anywhere', 'very', 'key', 'moment', 'small', 'addition', 'film', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'Dunbar', 'character', 'arc', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'real.This', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'used', 'cut', 'scenes', 'great', 'effect', 'similar', 'extended', 'cuts', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'are', 'great', 'superfans', 'also', 'great', 'regular', 'viewer', 'Yes', 'most', 'cuts', 'were', 'obviously', 'cut', 'out', 'reason', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'unnecessary', 'core', 'story', 'like', 'story', 'as', 'much', 'do', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'delightful', 'details', 'experience']",N/A

459060,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6305304750,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","A film that is truly breathtaking, `Dances with Wolves' has a lot to admire.  The film is gorgeous to look at; beautifully shot by cinematographer Dean Semler and directed by Kevin Costner.  The story told is often engrossing and delicately handled for the most part, always grasping our attention despite the films lengthy running time.  The acting is mostly effective and at times it is amazing.  The emotional impact the audience is left with is sweeping and easy to get caught up in for the subject is presented in a very passionate way by Costner.Like I said; there is a lot to admire here.`Dances with Wolves' tells us the story of Lt. John J. Dunbar who, after an attempted suicide, is exiled to a remote Civil War outpost.  Alone and lonely John soon finds himself a target of the Native Americans nearby, but what starts as a hazardous relationship shifts to one of promise and hope as the Indians befriend John.  One particular Indian, Kicking Bird, is determined to communicate with John in order to find out what the White Man's plans are and when he is coming.  Kicking Bird uses Stands With A Fist to do this.  Stands With A Fist is a white woman who has been living as an Indian most of her life.  She hasn't spoken English for many years but forces herself to converse with John for the betterment of her people.`Dances with Wolves' has a sweeping range of focus, shifting from a drama to a romance to a morally important film, and Costner's steady hand and keen eye help make the transitions effortless and captivating.  The film never comes off as choppy or disconnected but always remains true to itself and for the most part feels very complete.The acting is a nice facet of the film.  Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell and Graham Greene all received Oscar nominations for their performances, and it's easy to see why.  Mary McDonnell has a delicate way of delivering her characters frailties, exposing her nervousness without making her feel overly unstable.  Graham Greene is very calm and commanding as Kicking Bird, creating a stable character with dreams and aspirations and a complete control over the situation.  The film hinges on Costner though, and he delivers a beautifully complete performance.  His emotional journey is brilliantly portrayed for us throughout the entire film, flowing effortlessly from loneliness, anger, admiration, love, loyalty, betrayal and honor.As a whole `Dances with Wolves' works wonderfully; in parts it works extremely well.  The film is not perfect and it suffers in some areas.  One particular area I was less than thrilled about was Costner's narration of the film.  Voice over is tricky because it takes a certain kind of voice to pull it off.  Kevin has a somewhat nasally, almost whiney voice and listening to him practically read to you for three hours can ware you down.  Some people you can stand to talk to but don't want to listen to them `read'; it just has a whole different sound to it.  Watching Costner act is enjoyable, but listening to him read is not.  The ending, while moving, also felt a little forced and the depiction of the settlers as arrogant and uneducated was a little extreme.I found myself wondering why Dunbar was never depicted in that fashion yet every other `White Man' was?Those faults are minor when you consider the entire scope of the film, yet they seem bigger when you single them out.  I would recommend this movie without reservation, but I hesitate to call it a masterpiece.  It is a very good film, a great one at that, and as far as `sweeping epics' go, it manages to capture just about every facet of what makes those films to wonderful.  I'd give the film a high B (B+) or maybe even a low A (A-).

459065,AK6UVFSU07NXH,6305304750,Anthony Hinde,"[8, 9]","For once I agree with the critics. &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; is brilliant. I walked out of the cinema after seeing this film and felt like I had gone through a religious revelation. I was glad to live in a world  which could make movies such as this.OK, that sounds a little  over the top but that is how I felt at the time. I pity those people who  didn't get to  see &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; on a big screen. Video  just does not do it justice. I own both the standard three hour wide screen  version laser disc of &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; as well as the special  four hour edition. Despite the movie being terrific it is difficult for me  to sit down for four straight hours. For that reason I have to split it  over two sessions. The original edition is for visitors to watch.Before I got the longer edition I was curious as to whether it was  better or just a watered down version of the first cut. Well it is  definitely better. There are so many new scenes that it would be too much  effort to list them. The major difference for me though was a section in  the middle where Dunbar, (Kevin Costner), has a moment of doubt about his  newfound friends. It occurs right before the buffalo hunt when he finds  them all celebrating their slaughter of the white buffalo hunters who were  responsible for the waste of so many fine animals. Even if it is justice he  is not comfortable with their evident joy at such an inherently brutal act.  'Nough said about the differences.The core story is short but the  telling is rich in nuance. We meet the wounded hero, Lieutenant Dunbar, in  a American civil war hospital tent. He is about to have his leg amputated.  While the doctors are having a smoke break he decides to rejoin his  regiment and break a long standing stale mate by riding to his death across  the enemy lines.  It doesn't go quite as planned however and he ends up  being the hero that turned the tide of battle. As a reward, he is given the  use of the best doctor and an unlimited choice of duty.His choice  is to go west to the Indian frontier. Unfortunately his superior officer at  his eventual posting, Major Fambrough, is mad. Just before his suicide the  Major sends Dunbar out to a new base right in the frontier. When he get's  there, the camp is deserted and unbeknownst to Dunbar the Major has not  filed his final order, meaning that no one knows the whereabouts of Dunbar.Only a little perturbed, Dunbar decides to clean up the camp and  wait for reinforcements. It isn't long before the local Indians turn up to  make his life more interesting. Over the course of time he is drawn more  and more into their community. Eventually his is forced to take the side of  the Indians over that of his fellow soldiers. A situation which leads to  his arrest. The only other major factor in the film is his romance with a  white woman who has been raised in the tribe since she was a young girl.  She is responsible in no small part for Dunbar switching sides.The message we are left with at the end of the film is that there  need not have been any SIDES in the first place.",5,Big as all outdoors,957398400,"05 4, 2000",2000,3112,"['once', 'agree', 'critics', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'brilliant', 'walked', 'cinema', 'seeing', 'film', 'felt', 'had', 'gone', 'religious', 'revelation', 'was', 'glad', 'live', 'world', 'could', 'make', 'movies', 'such', 'this.OK', 'little', 'top', 'how', 'felt', 'time', 'pity', 'people', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'big', 'screen', 'Video', 'just', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'own', 'standard', 'three', 'hour', 'wide', 'screen', 'version', 'laser', 'disc', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'as', 'well', 'special', 'four', 'hour', 'edition', 'movie', 'being', 'terrific', 'difficult', 'sit', 'down', 'four', 'straight', 'hours', 'reason', 'have', 'split', 'over', 'two', 'sessions', 'original', 'edition', 'visitors', 'watch.Before', 'got', 'longer', 'edition', 'was', 'curious', 'was', 'better', 'just', 'watered', 'down', 'version', 'first', 'cut', 'definitely', 'better', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'new', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'list', 'major', 'difference', 'was', 'section', 'middle', 'where', 'Dunbar', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'moment', 'doubt', 'newfound', 'friends', 'right', 'buffalo', 'hunt', 'when', 'celebrating', 'slaughter', 'white', 'buffalo', 'hunters', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'waste', 'so', 'many', 'fine', 'animals', 'Even', 'justice', 'not', 'comfortable', 'evident', 'joy', 'inherently', 'brutal', 'act', 'said', 'differences.The', 'core', 'story', 'short', 'telling', 'rich', 'nuance', 'meet', 'wounded', 'hero', 'Lieutenant', 'Dunbar', 'American', 'civil', 'war', 'hospital', 'tent', 'have', 'leg', 'amputated', 'doctors', 'are', 'having', 'smoke', 'break', 'rejoin', 'regiment', 'break', 'long', 'standing', 'stale', 'mate', 'riding', 'death', 'enemy', 'lines', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'planned', 'however', 'up', 'being', 'hero', 'turned', 'tide', 'battle', 'reward', 'given', 'use', 'best', 'doctor', 'unlimited', 'choice', 'duty.His', 'choice', 'go', 'west', 'Indian', 'frontier', 'Unfortunately', 'superior', 'officer', 'eventual', 'posting', 'Major', 'Fambrough', 'mad', 'Just', 'suicide', 'Major', 'sends', 'Dunbar', 'new', 'base', 'right', 'frontier', 'When', 'get', 'there', 'camp', 'deserted', 'unbeknownst', 'Dunbar', 'Major', 'not', 'filed', 'final', 'order', 'meaning', 'one', 'whereabouts', 'Dunbar.Only', 'little', 'perturbed', 'Dunbar', 'clean', 'up', 'camp', 'wait', 'reinforcements', ""n't"", 'long', 'local', 'Indians', 'turn', 'up', 'make', 'life', 'more', 'interesting', 'course', 'time', 'drawn', 'more', 'more', 'community', 'Eventually', 'forced', 'take', 'side', 'Indians', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'situation', 'arrest', 'only', 'other', 'major', 'factor', 'film', 'romance', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'tribe', 'was', 'young', 'girl', 'responsible', 'small', 'part', 'Dunbar', 'switching', 'sides.The', 'message', 'are', 'left', 'end', 'film', 'need', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'SIDES', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the &#34;new genius of American art films&#34;.Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the &#34;John Wayne&#34; bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a &#34;misunderstood&#34; progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish?Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything.

A magnificently done story of man's inhumanity to man and our complete misunderstanding of Native Americans which led to unnecessary bloodshed.  I am aware that all Native Americans were not peaceful, loving people until we came along.  That just isn't true.  They warred among themselves, took slaves, practiced cruelty.  But don't we do the same among ourselves?  No person or body of people are perfect but they didn't destroy themselves or the land with which they lived in harmony; we pretty much did that.  The Native Americans were decimated by diseases we brought with us because they had no built in immunity to as we did, by our desire for land and gold doing whatever it took to get what we wanted, the treaties Indians took seriously but were constantly broken by us because we discovered that we &#34;needed&#34; the land they had been given (even though it was mostly poor land).  Their main food sources were destroyed by self-serving uncaring people to whom money meant more than common decency.  Many on both sides were patently vicious and the majority won, didn't we?  History shows the half-truth that &#34;might is right&#34;: those that had the power and the numbers inevitably took from those with lesser or  power and smaller numbers.  It's always been the way of humankind - not admirable but the way of the world from its beginning.  Sometimes good can come from bad; the United States being one of them.  With all its faults past and present it is still the best that the world has to offer.  But for that to happen the American Indian had to suffer and die.  Do we make amends?  Impossible.  Nobody and no amount of money can amend the destruction and humility that has weighed down the hundreds of tribes of American Indians - a great loss for humanity.  What we can do is recognize what has happened in the past and work together to keep it from happening again.  We should live up to our glorious Declaration of Independence and Constitution and abide by its precepts - in particular &#34;all men are created equal&#34; not some, but all of us.  It doesn't guarantee an equal outcome but acknowledges that we are all born with some innate quality that can make each of us special in our own way.  We all could become more special by living those lofty words of our precious documents by treating everyone from a person to a whole people with the respect for their specialness that has been so sadly lacking in the past.

459097,AYJ6P9F8GX9XF,6305304750,Cecily Champagne,"[2, 3]","Kevin Costner undoubtedly had epic aspirations for Dances with Wolves.  His desire to create a cinematic powerhouse, on par with ambitious classics like Gone with the Wind, is clear from the movie's length (a never dull 3 hours); its fastidious attention to details; its grandiose, swelling score; its noble subject; and its breathtaking visuals.  While the film excels on several levels, it is in this last area - its cinematography - that I feel Dances with Wolves achieves its greatest success.  Its colors are rich and warm, the sweeping landscape shots are amazing, and several scenes - especially a buffalo hunt - demonstrate absolute cinematographic and directorial mastery.  If for no other reason, I would recommend watching this movie for its aesthetic pleasures.As far as the story goes: Costner stars as John Dunbar, a Union Army officer stationed - at his own request - at an isolated post in the Western frontier.  It is here that he develops a relationship with the local Sioux tribe.  The story unfolds as you might expect: Costner grows to respect the Sioux and their way of live; there are battles; there is a romance ...to tell you the truth, the plot - for me - was pretty unexceptional.  Costner's character is a perfect hero: brave, noble, kind (in other words, somewhat flat).  The Sioux are, likewise, practically faultless: they demonstrate tight familial bonds; they live in harmony with the land; they are funny, smart, and fairly open-minded when it comes to this white stranger.  And the white men in the film - with the exception of Costner - are crass, close-minded, ignorant and violent.  I do not mean in any way to condone our country's history of horrific violence and greed when it comes to our relationship with Native Americans; I am only pointing out that this film's characterizations are somewhat easy.  I think the film might have been even more interesting and challenging if it would have portrayed its characters (specifically its white characters) in a more complex and a less typecast manner.  But this is a minor complaint (in any case, it probably makes up for all those old Westerns that portrayed Native Americans as uncouth savages).

I've watched it 5 times and eventually bought the DVD too.  Loved the scenery.  Great cast of actors.  My only main objection was his love interest (Mary) which did not really fit her part (looks and mannerisms etc).  She tried hard and it came across okay, but her appearance (esp the hastily messed up ""modern beauty shop"" style hair - all well cut ""even ends"" - obviously modern styled underneath) detracted from her part (she did not look like a pioneer woman from that 1870s period or one that had been in an Indian tribe for a long period - acted too modern too) but rather she talked and looked like a woman from 2000s who sprayed her hair and then lamely attempted to make it messy looking like from the past).  She came across as a city woman trying too hard to be from the wild, esp her contrived broken speech (not believable).  She is better in Battlestar G as a future President.  My only minor objection to the movie was it had no sequel (Part 2 or 3) to show me what happened after this movie's end, to Kevin and the members of the tribe etc.  I felt I needed more movies, and also a better closure at its end to the close attachment I had gained while watching the movie.

459101,A2N932LHI27WTC,6305304750,Chem,"[16, 23]","Wow, what a movie filled with contradictions.First off, the positives:The scenery in this film was WONDERFUL. Nothing short of epic. My hat is off to whomever engineered or imagined all that; he/she did a GREAT job !!The same for the costume people - everything seemed correct (to my inexpert eye:).The Buffalo scenes are particularly to be complimented. I'm sure there were animal handlers involved; in fact, I think I read about that years ago, how special care was taken with the animals. That is commendable...The negatives:Unfortunately, this part steals the show....It begins with Costner himself; he is a limited actor (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with his American accent, etc) who is not suited to a ""rugged character"" role which this called for.The worst part, of course, is the politically correct (PC) portrayal of the native Americans. The Sioux tribe is portayed, arbitrarily the viewer must assume, as ""innocents"" while the Pawnee are thrice shown as evil or savages (they steal the white girl Stands With a Fist, then later happen to raid her village when she is an adult; they murder the uncouth but endearing Timmons, the mule skinner. Incidentally, this actor was the best in the movie, imho).The Sioux, the quintessential Plains tribe, are depicted as peaceful, taking only what they need and living in harmony with nature; they don't build anything or disrupt the environment, and when they fight it is ONLY to protect their local village from a direct threat (this has overtones of Anarchist political philosophy), and they care for one another.Is this accurate?? Well, the Plains Indian culture was a warlike, nomadic existence, living in a harsh environment...But the movie never shows the day-to-day harshness of the Plains culture - for example, the elderly woman, whose husband has died, being turned out of a village in winter to sleep with the horses (she has become a liability to the nomadic tribe - with her husband dead she is considered 'dead'); the initiation rites of manhood that must be endured by young men (the failure of which could result in banishment). In short, it portrays all that was good about native American life, while almost TOTALLY disregarding its negatives - without which they would hardly be a part of humanity. The film is silly in this regard...Compare it to the excellent, more mature 1993 film ""Last of the Mohicans"" starring Daniel Day-Lewis (much the better actor than Costner). This film correctly portrays the native Americans as ""players"" rather than ""pawns"" in the international game of Who Gets America. In ""Mohicans"" the Indians are correctly well armed, reasonably aware of the politico-military machinations going on around them (in which they in fact partcipate - e.g. the French and Indian War), and above all are shown with human foibles and vices - the same greed, aspirations, etc...I mentioned ""well armed"" above. This is particularly misunderstood today. The Indians realized the value of firearms and modern weapons almost immediately upon European settlement. There was a thriving arms trade very soon after Eurpeans arrived. The Indians didn't have the skill to make them yet, but they knew they wanted/needed them. (Research the Battle of Little Bighorn, for one example of white misunderstanding of Indian arms.)But in Dances w/ Wolves, it appears the Indians are completely under-armed and, in fact, totally oblivious to European technology until they meet Dunbar. This is ridiculous.Ah well...This movie rested its laurels on an incredibly good scenery/cinematic effort, and a sympathetic PC culture of the very late 1980s and early 1990s as far as its ""theme"" or ""messsage"" was concerned.Its weakest link is Costner who is a marginal actor, much less a director...I can't help wondering what Day-Lewis, teamed with a competent director, might have done with this idea?The movie did help kick off a resurgence of Western-themed movies, but thats about it.Regretably, I give it a couple of stars for the scenery, and try to put it out of mind. Its a shame, because this had a lot of potential....",2,Incredible cinematics & scenery; terrible PC theme,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,4084,"['Wow', 'what', 'movie', 'filled', 'contradictions.First', 'off', 'positives', 'scenery', 'film', 'was', 'WONDERFUL', 'Nothing', 'short', 'epic', 'hat', 'whomever', 'engineered', 'imagined', 'he/she', 'did', 'GREAT', 'job', 'same', 'costume', 'people', 'everything', 'seemed', 'correct', 'inexpert', 'eye', '.The', 'Buffalo', 'scenes', 'are', 'particularly', 'be', 'complimented', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'animal', 'handlers', 'involved', 'fact', 'think', 'read', 'years', 'ago', 'how', 'special', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'animals', 'commendable', 'negatives', 'Unfortunately', 'part', 'show', '.It', 'begins', 'Costner', 'limited', 'actor', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Prince', 'Thieves', 'American', 'accent', 'etc', 'who', 'not', 'suited', 'rugged', 'character', 'role', 'called', 'for.The', 'worst', 'part', 'course', 'politically', 'correct', 'PC', 'portrayal', 'native', 'Americans', 'Sioux', 'tribe', 'portayed', 'arbitrarily', 'viewer', 'must', 'assume', 'innocents', 'Pawnee', 'are', 'thrice', 'shown', 'evil', 'savages', 'steal', 'white', 'girl', 'Fist', 'then', 'later', 'happen', 'raid', 'village', 'when', 'adult', 'murder', 'uncouth', 'endearing', 'Timmons', 'mule', 'skinner', 'Incidentally', 'actor', 'was', 'best', 'movie', 'imho', '.The', 'Sioux', 'quintessential', 'Plains', 'tribe', 'are', 'depicted', 'peaceful', 'taking', 'only', 'what', 'need', 'living', 'harmony', 'nature', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'anything', 'disrupt', 'environment', 'when', 'fight', 'ONLY', 'protect', 'local', 'village', 'direct', 'threat', 'overtones', 'Anarchist', 'political', 'philosophy', 'care', 'one', 'another.Is', 'accurate', 'Well', 'Plains', 'Indian', 'culture', 'was', 'warlike', 'nomadic', 'existence', 'living', 'harsh', 'environment', 'movie', 'never', 'day-to-day', 'harshness', 'Plains', 'culture', 'example', 'elderly', 'woman', 'husband', 'died', 'being', 'turned', 'village', 'winter', 'sleep', 'horses', 'become', 'liability', 'nomadic', 'tribe', 'husband', 'dead', 'considered', ""'dead"", 'initiation', 'rites', 'manhood', 'must', 'be', 'endured', 'young', 'men', 'failure', 'could', 'result', 'banishment', 'short', 'was', 'good', 'native', 'American', 'life', 'almost', 'TOTALLY', 'disregarding', 'negatives', 'would', 'hardly', 'be', 'part', 'humanity', 'film', 'silly', 'regard', 'Compare', 'excellent', 'more', 'mature', '1993', 'film', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'starring', 'Daniel', 'Day-Lewis', 'much', 'better', 'actor', 'Costner', 'film', 'correctly', 'native', 'Americans', 'players', 'rather', 'pawns', 'international', 'game', 'Who', 'Gets', 'America', 'Mohicans', 'Indians', 'are', 'correctly', 'well', 'armed', 'reasonably', 'aware', 'politico-military', 'machinations', 'going', 'fact', 'partcipate', 'e.g', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'are', 'shown', 'human', 'foibles', 'vices', 'same', 'greed', 'aspirations', 'etc', 'mentioned', 'well', 'armed', 'particularly', 'misunderstood', 'today', 'Indians', 'realized', 'value', 'firearms', 'modern', 'weapons', 'almost', 'immediately', 'upon', 'European', 'settlement', 'was', 'thriving', 'arms', 'trade', 'very', 'soon', 'Eurpeans', 'arrived', 'Indians', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'skill', 'make', 'yet', 'knew', 'wanted/needed', 'Research', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'one', 'example', 'white', 'misunderstanding', 'Indian', 'arms', 'Dances', 'w/', 'Indians', 'are', 'completely', 'under-armed', 'fact', 'totally', 'oblivious', 'European', 'technology', 'meet', 'Dunbar', 'ridiculous.Ah', 'well', 'movie', 'rested', 'laurels', 'incredibly', 'good', 'scenery/cinematic', 'effort', 'sympathetic', 'PC', 'culture', 'very', 'late', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'as', 'far', 'theme', 'messsage', 'was', 'concerned.Its', 'weakest', 'link', 'Costner', 'who', 'marginal', 'actor', 'much', 'less', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'Day-Lewis', 'teamed', 'competent', 'director', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'idea', 'movie', 'did', 'help', 'kick', 'off', 'resurgence', 'Western-themed', 'movies', 'thats', 'it.Regretably', 'give', 'couple', 'stars', 'scenery', 'try', 'put', 'mind', 'shame', 'had', 'lot', 'potential']",N/A

With an additional 56 minutes, the film is just under 4 HOURS LONG. Not that that's a bad thing.The original DVD is now out of print, and has been for some year or two now. When I heard that, I was shocked. This is one of the best films ever made, and at least with this one, the 'powers that be' took notice, and gave it 7 oscars. This is an epic of a film that sees John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) during the US civil war. He's given his choice of assignments, so he chooses Ft. Sedgewick, ""the westernmost fort in the realm"". He arrives to find it deserted.Dunbar begins interacting with the local Sioux indians in what is some of the best film ever shot. The characters are rich and full of life, and the indian culture is portrayed as both beautiful and violent. This film shows a different side of the indians than most other films, a very refreshing side.This DVD set contains TONS of extras, more than I could describe here. They are well worth the extra price, and make a great addition to the film. The added hour of footage gives more insight into the characters and really make this film better believe it or not. The scenes were originally cut for obvious film-length reasons.All that said, I feel that this film is one of the best movies ever made, and that everyone should watch it at least once.

459114,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6305304750,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 4]","Even in it's original 3 hour running time, the film still felt a bit too hefty. Like in a lot of cases of extended editions (as opposed to director's cut), the extended version is simply an alternate take; a kind of optional version of the film should you feel compelled to see it. I always liked Dances with Wolves, the directorial debut for Kevin Costner and multiple Academy Award winner, but I always felt like the sum of its parts won me over but maybe not as a unified whole.Lt. John Dunbar is a United States officer during the Civil War and after an unsuccessful suicide attempt of him running bare into enemy fire but miraculously surviving, he has the option to be posted anywhere. He picks Fort Sedgewick, a distant and remote outpost where he'll live by himself. Hanging around the camp is a wolf he names Two-Socks and nearby is a Sioux village that over time, he becomes friends with and even becomes part of their community. A relationship with one of the women develops but he still has to deal with the approaching officers who want to conquer more land, effectively driving out the Sioux.The extra scenes are meant to develop the story and offer more background and taken on their own, they actually work pretty fine. Instead of finding Dunbar's new post deserted, we actually see officers previously stationed had just left. We get more screentime with some minor characters which help flesh them out but takes away from Dunbar himself and losing the focus on him. All of the scenes gives off the feeling of making a movie more longer than it should be (as Costner says himself in the commentary when he says ""it's not a secret I like long movies"") but luckily there's a disc change so you don't watch all 4 hours in one setting.As far as the film is concerned, it's quite a great film with some gorgeous cinematography, excellent performances and some pretty exciting action scenes. Costner might not have the most immense range but there is quite a few films where he is convincing and this is one of them. I have 2 complaints as a whole: the narration is read like a kid who's asked to read book passages in class with a kind of uninvolving drone. When the officers show up they almost have this kind of malevolent quality where they're portrayed as hick morons with guns. Other than that though I don't have any issues with the film and while it's probably something I won't turn on constantly, whenever I do watch it I still like it.One concern that I wish was addressed as to where the special features are. It reminds me of the Lord of the Rings extended cuts where all the main in-depth featurettes were on the longer, expensive cut so while I have no issues with the stuff we get on here, with 2 commentaries and a feature-length documentary broken in halves, it would've worked a bit if the option of having all of it on the theatrical edition would help people who want the bonus parts but not to have it attached to the longer version of the film.It probably isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea and there are even times where I'm not that big a fan but there's other times where I do get quite involved in it so give it a shot and see what you think. Word of caution: the theatrical edition normally available is full screen so it's either a 4 hour widescreen or a 3 hour full. I can't stand full so buying this one was inevitable.",5,"A great, if overlong epic drama",1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,3366,"['Even', 'original', '3', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'film', 'still', 'felt', 'bit', 'too', 'hefty', 'lot', 'cases', 'extended', 'editions', 'opposed', 'director', 'cut', 'extended', 'version', 'simply', 'alternate', 'take', 'kind', 'optional', 'version', 'film', 'should', 'feel', 'compelled', 'see', 'always', 'liked', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'multiple', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'always', 'felt', 'sum', 'parts', 'won', 'over', 'maybe', 'not', 'unified', 'whole.Lt', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'United', 'States', 'officer', 'Civil', 'War', 'unsuccessful', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'running', 'bare', 'enemy', 'fire', 'miraculously', 'surviving', 'option', 'be', 'posted', 'anywhere', 'Fort', 'Sedgewick', 'distant', 'remote', 'outpost', 'where', ""'ll"", 'live', 'Hanging', 'camp', 'wolf', 'Two-Socks', 'nearby', 'Sioux', 'village', 'time', 'friends', 'even', 'becomes', 'part', 'community', 'relationship', 'one', 'women', 'still', 'deal', 'approaching', 'officers', 'who', 'want', 'conquer', 'more', 'land', 'effectively', 'driving', 'out', 'Sioux.The', 'extra', 'scenes', 'are', 'meant', 'develop', 'story', 'offer', 'more', 'background', 'taken', 'own', 'actually', 'work', 'pretty', 'fine', 'Instead', 'finding', 'Dunbar', 'new', 'post', 'deserted', 'actually', 'see', 'officers', 'previously', 'stationed', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'get', 'more', 'screentime', 'minor', 'characters', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'away', 'Dunbar', 'losing', 'focus', 'scenes', 'feeling', 'making', 'movie', 'more', 'longer', 'should', 'be', 'Costner', 'commentary', 'when', 'not', 'secret', 'like', 'long', 'movies', 'luckily', 'disc', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', '4', 'hours', 'one', 'setting.As', 'far', 'film', 'concerned', 'quite', 'great', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'performances', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'Costner', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'immense', 'range', 'quite', 'few', 'films', 'where', 'convincing', 'one', 'have', '2', 'complaints', 'whole', 'narration', 'read', 'kid', 'who', 'asked', 'read', 'book', 'passages', 'class', 'kind', 'uninvolving', 'drone', 'When', 'officers', 'show', 'up', 'almost', 'have', 'kind', 'malevolent', 'quality', 'where', ""'re"", 'portrayed', 'hick', 'morons', 'guns', 'Other', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'issues', 'film', 'probably', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'turn', 'constantly', 'whenever', 'do', 'watch', 'still', 'it.One', 'concern', 'wish', 'was', 'addressed', 'where', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'extended', 'cuts', 'where', 'main', 'in-depth', 'featurettes', 'were', 'longer', 'expensive', 'cut', 'so', 'have', 'issues', 'stuff', 'get', 'here', '2', 'commentaries', 'feature-length', 'documentary', 'broken', 'halves', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'bit', 'option', 'having', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'would', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'bonus', 'parts', 'not', 'have', 'attached', 'longer', 'version', 'film.It', 'probably', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'are', 'even', 'times', 'where', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'do', 'get', 'quite', 'involved', 'so', 'give', 'shot', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'Word', 'caution', 'theatrical', 'edition', 'normally', 'available', 'full', 'screen', '4', 'hour', 'widescreen', '3', 'hour', 'full', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'full', 'so', 'buying', 'one', 'was', 'inevitable']",N/A

But what a film!  The scene near the start where he rides his horse between Union and Rebel lines of battle, suicidal, hands thrown back, anticipating the hail of bullets....what a moment, unforgettable--and unforgettably ironic in that he gives his future enemies, the Union Army, their chance at glory.  This film is full of such ironies, such stabs at integrity and the perverse consequences of breathtaking chances taken in good faith.If one man on an ego trip could finally dip down into the sources of real creativity and produce something wonderous, Costner did it here, dancing with wolves and with the wilderness so ably framed throughout the film.More than cinematic, more than a love story, more than the tale of Sioux in retreat and an Everyman figure in his own retreat from the civilization that betrays everything for money and power, the dance herein traces the lineaments of a new kind of life, a life lived close to the natural fiber of things.  It's a possibility raised for whatever reasons.Sometimes an actor is so obnoxious a person that discounting his creations is relatively easy, William Shatner being an obvious example.  I beg to disagree on the grounds of the fictional presence such actors create.  For I don't believe in fiction.  One person in so-called real life, they lend to us in the realm of imagination their very noblest selves.  In their productions, in their roles:  this is who they truly are!

When I first saw it many years ago, I was unimpressed and thought it was an example of the shallow ""whites bad/minorities good"" school of thought wherein oafish, cruel whites trample down saintly earth-child Indians who live as one with the planet, and never seem to speak using contractions. But over time I eased up on Dances With Wolves and recognized it for its beauty, for its intricacy, for its story of friendships overcoming outward divisions, and for its epic exploration of a lost culture and its way of life. It never fails to touch me, seeing as I am a depiction of the last free generation of a people who will face near genocide within a decade. It always makes me wonder what happened to this character, or that character. I think I know the grim answer.I still find the first third of Dances With Wolves to be slightly slow moving, and I absolutely hate seeing things crumble in the final forty or so minutes of this motion picture, but for that inner hour of the film, Dances With Wolves truly ranks high on the list of American movies made in its time. I think it is a sign of Dances With Wolves' quality that it seems to grow better on each occasion I see it.With the recent release of Mel Gibson's Apocalyto, and also from such past films as Windwalker, Black Robe, and Dances With Wolves itself, I think Hollywood should take note that  there is a lot that can be achieved story-wise in setting a film in pre-Columbian times.

Ever. Its leisurely pace, the subtitles, the wide-open spaces, the landscapes ... the physical aspects alone of this movie were enough to turn my head completely around. To say nothing of the score, the photography, the writing, the characters, the acting, and Kevin Costner's lovely, skillful, controlled direction. To me, it was the be-all, end-all.I still love &quot;Dances.&quot; Revisionists are now saying that Costner's great film is too slow, too self-important, too benign, too whatever. I'm not real big on the idea that there's this huge jealousy factor at work against Kevin Costner, but in this respect, I'd have to say that people just seem to have something against the man, and they seem to begrudge him even &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot;No matter. This is one of the best movies of the 1990s (or, I guess, late 1980s). It was obviously inspired by the great epics of the past (not the least &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) and paved the way for &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Braveheart.&quot; Costner stumbled with &quot;The Postman,&quot; and has made more than his share of terrible movies, but he's got the goods as a director. &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; will more than stand the test of time.",5,Changed my life,1064793600,"09 29, 2003",2003,1423,"['OK', 'movie', ""n't"", 'religious', 'experience', 'anything', 'came', 'awfully', 'close', 'when', 'saw', 'back', ""'91"", 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'was', 'time', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', ""'d"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Ever', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'subtitles', 'wide-open', 'spaces', 'landscapes', 'physical', 'aspects', 'alone', 'movie', 'were', 'enough', 'turn', 'head', 'completely', 'around', 'say', 'nothing', 'score', 'photography', 'writing', 'characters', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'lovely', 'skillful', 'controlled', 'direction', 'was', 'be-all', 'end-all.I', 'still', 'love', 'quot', 'Dances.', 'quot', 'Revisionists', 'are', 'now', 'saying', 'Costner', 'great', 'film', 'too', 'slow', 'too', 'self-important', 'too', 'benign', 'too', 'whatever', ""'m"", 'not', 'real', 'big', 'idea', 'huge', 'jealousy', 'factor', 'work', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'respect', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'people', 'just', 'seem', 'have', 'something', 'man', 'seem', 'begrudge', 'even', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves.', 'quot', 'matter', 'one', 'best', 'movies', '1990s', 'guess', 'late', '1980s', 'was', 'obviously', 'inspired', 'great', 'epics', 'past', 'not', 'least', 'quot', 'Lawrence', 'Arabia', 'quot', 'paved', 'way', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'quot', 'Braveheart.', 'quot', 'Costner', 'stumbled', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'made', 'more', 'share', 'terrible', 'movies', 'got', 'goods', 'director', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'will', 'more', 'stand', 'test', 'time']",N/A
459132,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,6305304750,Daniel Hurley,"[2, 6]","I really enjoyed this highly photogenic western with Costner as a Civil War wounded veteran who desires to go west in exchange for his heroic if not Christ like wounding that broke a military stalemate virtually by spirit as opposed to a tactical explanation. That spirit pervades through the movie as Costner's character has a level of honesty mixed with naivety that serves him well with his encounters, not so much with the civilized man, but with domestic animals, starting with his horse, animals of the wild and his future Lakota friends. The film captures the lifestyle of the Sioux from Costner's eyes but also gives the viewer the 180 view of the Sioux, looking at the white men as peculiar and wasteful while the Sioux explaing their own values to Costner and by example. An absolutely beautiful movie with an added love interest as Costner meet's a woman within the tribe that creates an unusual but accepted match. I prefer the original cut as opposed to the long version, which is truer to the book. In the long cut, like in the book, the mystery of what happened to the platoon assigned to Costner's assigned fort/redoubt is clearly shown; however, in the edited commercial cut, you see the fort as Costner sees it, as an unsolved mystery. I think maintaining the mystery strengthens the movie as the viewer knows no more than Costner. I also did not think the extra scenes of the eccentric but debilitated commander that assigns Costner add anything to the movie, the edited version requires the viewer to figure out the obvious by themselves and not have it expanded unnecessarily. One criticism of the film is that it shows the Lakota to be abused by other tribes when in fact; the Sioux were the dominant tribe on the plains and feared by the Crow, Pawnee and Shoshone. However, not knowing the exact time span, by the 1870s if not earlier, the Crow, Pawnee and Shoshone did become allies with the soldiers against the Sioux and that is certainly accurate. Well done film and Graham Greene (Thunderheart) and Rodney Grant (Son of the Morning Star) play realistic thoughtful and brave Sioux respectively.",4,Great Exciting Western Tale: Sympathetic to the Sioux,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",2006,2121,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'highly', 'photogenic', 'western', 'Costner', 'Civil', 'War', 'wounded', 'veteran', 'who', 'go', 'west', 'exchange', 'heroic', 'not', 'Christ', 'wounding', 'broke', 'military', 'stalemate', 'virtually', 'spirit', 'opposed', 'tactical', 'explanation', 'spirit', 'movie', 'Costner', 'character', 'level', 'honesty', 'mixed', 'naivety', 'well', 'encounters', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'civilized', 'man', 'domestic', 'animals', 'starting', 'horse', 'animals', 'wild', 'future', 'Lakota', 'film', 'lifestyle', 'Sioux', 'Costner', 'eyes', 'also', 'viewer', '180', 'view', 'Sioux', 'looking', 'white', 'men', 'peculiar', 'wasteful', 'Sioux', 'explaing', 'own', 'values', 'Costner', 'example', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'added', 'love', 'interest', 'Costner', 'meet', 'woman', 'tribe', 'unusual', 'accepted', 'match', 'prefer', 'original', 'cut', 'opposed', 'long', 'version', 'truer', 'book', 'long', 'cut', 'book', 'mystery', 'what', 'happened', 'platoon', 'assigned', 'Costner', 'assigned', 'fort/redoubt', 'clearly', 'shown', 'however', 'edited', 'commercial', 'cut', 'see', 'fort', 'Costner', 'unsolved', 'mystery', 'think', 'maintaining', 'mystery', 'movie', 'viewer', 'more', 'Costner', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'extra', 'scenes', 'eccentric', 'debilitated', 'commander', 'Costner', 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'edited', 'version', 'viewer', 'figure', 'out', 'obvious', 'not', 'have', 'expanded', 'unnecessarily', 'One', 'criticism', 'film', 'Lakota', 'be', 'abused', 'other', 'tribes', 'when', 'fact', 'Sioux', 'were', 'dominant', 'tribe', 'plains', 'feared', 'Crow', 'Pawnee', 'Shoshone', 'However', 'not', 'knowing', 'exact', 'time', 'span', '1870s', 'not', 'earlier', 'Crow', 'Pawnee', 'Shoshone', 'did', 'become', 'allies', 'soldiers', 'Sioux', 'certainly', 'accurate', 'Well', 'done', 'film', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Thunderheart', 'Rodney', 'Grant', 'Son', 'Morning', 'Star', 'play', 'realistic', 'thoughtful', 'brave', 'Sioux', 'respectively']",N/A

459149,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6305304750,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[26, 28]","In 1990, actor/director Kevin Costner along with novelist/screenplay writer Michael Blake took on an ambitious project of developing a film titled ""Dances with Wolves"" with a budget of only $22 million.  Shot in South Dakota and Wyoming, the epic western would become one of the most memorable films to be created.With rave reviews, the film would make $424 million worldwide, would be credited for the revitalization of the Western genre in Hollywood and a film that would give Native Americans a sympathetic portrayal.""Dances with Wolves"" would win a total of 7 Academy Awards including ""Best Picture"", ""Directing"", ""Writing Adapted Screenplay"", ""Cinematography"", ""Film Editing"", ""Sound Mixing"", ""Original Musical Score"" and also win a Golden Globe for ""Best Motion Picture Drama"" and ""Best Director"".In 2007, ""Dances with Wolves"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""While ""Dances with Wolves"" have received a number of DVD releases, from its 180-minute theatrical version in 1998, a DTS version released in 1999 and then a special edition featuring a 236 minute Director's Cut in 2003, ""Dances with Wolves"" receives its first released in HD via Blu-ray with ""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" edition which includes the special edition features from 2003 as well as utilizing newer features with Blu-ray technology.VIDEO:""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  Having owned previous incarnations of the DVD release, especially the original 1998 DVD release, one thing I have noticed on Blu-ray is how vibrant the colors look on Blu-ray.From the golden weeds and grass that surround the area and the blue skies up above, You can literally see the shading and detail of those long strands of grass and when it comes to showcasing the Fort or even the Indian camp and seeing the animal hide on the clothing to the tents, there is quite a bit of detail that can be seen.Also, when you see a close up of Dunbar's face, you can see skin pores, clear stubble.  Especially when you see the war paint applied on the skin surface, everything looks clear and detailed!Blacks are nice and deep, there is a fine layer of grain.I personally didn't see any blemishes or traces of DNR or any softness.  Overall, awesome PQ for ""Dances with Wolves"".AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with English Dolby Surround.  As the majority of the film features dialogue, when there's action...may it be horses riding in the distance, the buffalo trampling and skidding on the ground, the rifle shots, the lossless soundtrack does a good job in making those scenes quite immersive by utilizing every channel.Even in non-action scenes, a good number of ambiance of how things sound outdoors.  So, bugs, birds, dogs, horses, everything can be heard all around you.Dialogue is crisp and clear and the music by John Barry is fantastic via lossless!Subtitles are provided in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:* Audio Commentary - Audio commentary by Kevin Costner and Producer Jim Wilson.  An excellent audio commentary which was included in the 2003 special edition release.  Both Costner and Wilson provide plenty of information on various scenes, challenges they had and just really deliver with this informative commentary track.* Audio Commentary- Audio commentary by Director of Photography Dean Semler and Film Editor Neil Travis.  Another awesome audio commentary previously included in the special edition that deals directly with cinematography and editing.* Military Rank and Social Hiearchy Guide - While watching the film, whenever a soldier of rank appears, a rank insignia on the bottom shows up and gives you details of the soldier's duties.* Real History or Movie Make-Believe - A trivia track that can be watched during the film.  The only problem is that when you go to the next question, it pauses the video for a few seconds.DISC 2:* A Day in the Life on the Western Frontier - (14:18) A new feature for Blu-ray in which we learn about the true story of those who migrated west to settle in the plain states.  From the dangers they faced, the making of sod houses, featuring photos from that era and more.* Original Making of Dances with Wolves - (20:58) An older making of ""Dances with Wolves"" featuring Kevin Costner , producer Jim Wilson and writer Michael Blake talking about their experiences of making the film and how the screenplay was written and how Costner was brought into the film.* The Creation of an Epic: A Retrospective Documentary - (1:14:39) From the 2003 special edition, Kevin Costner, Jim Wilson, Michael Blake, Mary McDonnell and others talk about their experience working on the film.

The buffalo stampede and having to shoot a bow and arrow to Costner having to ride a horse in the middle of a stampede with both hands on a rifle, many people today would think that whole scene was absolutely crazy (as it would probably be done digitally).  But Costner and crew made it happen!Also, no matter how execs tried to have Costner and crew cut the film, these men stood behind their work and made sure that their film would not be butchered.  Once again, a film that was seen as improbable was made possible with literally blood, sweat and tears and in the end, the film was amazingly successful.I know that there are some people who felt that ""Goodfellas"" and even ""The Godfather III"" were deserving of the many awards that ""Dances with Wolves"" had won back in 1990 but really, this epic western was excellent.  When I first watched it, I was surprised because Native Americans in films that do portray Indians, typically portray them as savages.  This was a film that literally shows them as a group that lived off the land, that were there first and were just defending their land and their families.  So, I felt that the screenplay was excellently written by Michael Blake and portrayed quite wonderfully onscreen courtesy of Kevin Costner, Mary McDonnell, Graham Greene, Rodney A Grant, Floyd Westerman, Tantoo Cardinal, Michael Spears and the many talent who made viewers feel this film feel quite authentic.As for the Blu-ray release, I can tell you right now, even if you own the wonderful 2003 special edition DVD release, the picture quality and lossless soundtrack definitely warrant an upgrade.  Sure, the special features are familiar features to those who own the previous special edition but to watch this in HD, I was quite impressed by the overall detail and how vibrant the film looked.If you love this film, it's really an easy choice to make, ""Dances with Wolves: 20th Anniversary"" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray (20th Anniversary):  Magnificent!!!,1296259200,"01 29,

First of all the movie is racist toward whites.  Kevin Costner seems like the only white man who has sympathy for American Indians.  Costner depicts whites as sloppy, drunk, and incompetent, while depicting the Native Americans as pure, noble, and peaceful.  The settlers who came from Europe did horrible things to the American Indians, but that does not mean the American Indians were all pure at heart and the white man was all evil.The war and genocide that occurred between the two groups is what almost always happens when two people of different race, religion, and ethnic groups conflict with each other.  Costner was paying respect to the Native Americans and that was a good thing that he did.  The American Indians deserve it up to a point.

To do this in Dances with Wolves as Costner has is sensational when you consider how much the lead role dominated this movie, and how good the movie turned out. Set against a spectacular western backdrop, Costner's normally drab acting style suits this role very well.  Costner is a much maligned actor and sometimes the criticism is justified, but he should be applauded for his efforts in this atmospheric epic.

459153,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6305304750,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[26, 56]","DANCES WITH WOLVES is a tale of two movies.  The first film is a moving, epic story about Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) who accepts a post at a remote fort in the Dakotas and turns out to be the only soldier there.  He befriends first, a wolf, then his nearest neighbors, a Lakota Sioux tribe.  Both friendships are tentative at the outset, yet succeed and are nurtured through trust.  It is a beautiful, wonderful story.But then comes the second movie.  The evil white man descends upon Dunbar's abandoned fort and systematically, demonically, begins to destroy and kill.  This movie provides no insight into such wanton cruelty; it only portrays it, over and over (even to the point of showing a group of soldiers getting their kicks shooting Two Socks, Dunbar's befriended wolf).  Fortunately, Dunbar is able to escape such evil, with the aid of his Sioux brothers, and thus assimilate back into the Indian culture.Accordingly, a wonderful film is ruined by political correctness.  We are given a complete, warm potrayal of the collectivist society of the Lakotas--both pros and cons.  But no such treatment is given of the plains soldiers who fought the Indians; they are portrayed as ruthless, cutthroat killers, and because of the one-dimensional depiction the ending of this film disintegrates into bitter disappointment.

It gives a view of the Native American culture which used to rule this landmass with a perspicacity and verisimilitude never before seen in an American movie theater.  This is truly a great American epic.Kevin Costner, who is normally as bland as the Sahara desert, delivers the best performance of his career.  Although not the most exciting actor in cinema, Costner was nonetheless perfect for this part (just as William Shatner was perfect for Captain Kirk, despite his limited acting ability). Costner's direction, too, was impeccable.  The rest of the cast, including Graham Greene and Mary McDonnel, team up to create an instant classic.The film takes place in the mid-1860s.  The Civil War is winding down and the Union Army has begun its invasion westward into American Indian country.  In other words, it takes place at an epoch that, looking back, would prove to be the beginning of the end for the Western American Indian way of life.  This movie is about the last days of an extraordinary culture which would find its end all too abruptly.The story centers around a Union Army soldier named John Dunbar (Costner).  He ends up on an abandoned outpost out in the middle of the plain states.  During his pseudo-hermitage, he encounters a tribe of Sioux Indians.  Luckily for him, they prove to be friendly and it is the forging of their relationship(s) with him that form the core of the movie's plot.This is an exceptional, powerful movie that is suitable for the entire family.  It has a few scenes of mild violence, but is far less graphic than what is shown on Television series every night.  The soundtrack, written by John Barry, is top notch and is integrated into the movie to an extent [both in emotional importance and in appropriate timing] that surpasses any movie score I've ever heard. This is a truly poignant film which can't help but move all who view it.

Here is the gospel truth, according to The Digital Bits, MGM Home Entertainment, in conjunction with 20th Century Fox, will release ""Dances with Wolves"" on Blu-ray on January 11, 2011. This BD will present the extended cut of this Oscar-winning western starring and directed by Kevin Costner. Most of the previous DVD extras will reportedly be included, along with newly-produced material. Also, according to Blu-Ray.com, this 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray release will indeed be the Director's extended cut at 236 minutes (3 hrs 56 mins), with the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1, the Video codec of MPEG-4 AVC and the resolution at 1080p.So, we won't be getting it in time for Christmas, but we're going to be getting the best possible release (read the longest length) and even newly produced material. So, you can stop all the badgering of Amazon and MGM, partners! Mosey on over to your shoppin' basket and drop one of `em in, sign in & place your pre-order. This is just a suggestion, mind you. Amazon will eventually get around to updating their website to reflect 236 minutes for this Blu-Ray version.Obviously, I cannot rate the video transfer and audio quality of the Blu-Ray edition until after it is released. If it does not measure up to my current rating, I will amend it after having watched the Blu-Ray version. But, my ""Collector's Edition"" SDVD was worth every penny which appeared to push the limits of my top of the line Samsung Blu-Ray (which up-converts SDVD discs) player and Samsung's last year's top of the line LED LCD TV, not to mention the limits of my poor old eyes.With so much at stake, I am willing to bet MGM took the time and expense to get this one done right this time around. Mine is on pre-order and can hardly wait to saddle up one more time with this old friend.Now, if they'd only dust off their other classic westerns, restore 'em, remaster 'em and release 'em too...but, that is a whole different story!True Grit is finally getting the Blu-Ray treatment, but only because of the pending release in theaters on Christmas Day of an updated version with all new stars. They had to be kicked in the britches to get their attention and the original ""True Grit"" was an Academy Award winner for the Duke. It is a crime the way the old classic westerns are being treated by the studios. The demand for quality classic westerns on Blu-Ray is there. The studios are just not listening, nor willing to incur the expense to ""do them right"". I'd better step down from my soap box now, 'cause I get upset when I think about how they're ignoring us classic western collectors.Update:11/24/10: Amazon has updated their website's listing for this Blu-Ray release from 181 minutes to 236 minutes just as I predicted they'd get around to doin'.",5,Let's Put This Debate To Rest About the Blu-Ray USA Release!,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,2792,"['Whoa', 'there', 'partner', 'Here', 'gospel', 'truth', 'according', 'Digital', 'Bits', 'MGM', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'conjunction', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'will', 'release', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Blu-ray', 'January', '11', '2011', 'BD', 'will', 'present', 'extended', 'cut', 'Oscar-winning', 'western', 'starring', 'directed', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Most', 'previous', 'DVD', 'extras', 'will', 'reportedly', 'be', 'included', 'newly-produced', 'material', 'Also', 'according', 'Blu-Ray.com', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', 'will', 'indeed', 'be', 'Director', 'extended', 'cut', '236', 'minutes', '3', 'hrs', '56', 'mins', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-4', 'AVC', 'resolution', '1080p.So', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'time', 'Christmas', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'getting', 'best', 'possible', 'release', 'read', 'longest', 'length', 'even', 'newly', 'produced', 'material', 'So', 'can', 'stop', 'badgering', 'Amazon', 'MGM', 'partners', 'Mosey', 'shoppin', 'basket', 'drop', 'one', 'em', 'sign', 'place', 'pre-order', 'just', 'suggestion', 'mind', 'Amazon', 'will', 'eventually', 'get', 'updating', 'website', 'reflect', '236', 'minutes', 'Blu-Ray', 'version.Obviously', 'can', 'not', 'rate', 'video', 'transfer', 'audio', 'quality', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'released', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'current', 'rating', 'will', 'amend', 'having', 'watched', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'SDVD', 'was', 'worth', 'penny', 'appeared', 'push', 'limits', 'top', 'line', 'Samsung', 'Blu-Ray', 'SDVD', 'discs', 'player', 'Samsung', 'last', 'year', 'top', 'line', 'LED', 'LCD', 'TV', 'not', 'mention', 'limits', 'poor', 'old', 'eyes.With', 'so', 'much', 'stake', 'am', 'willing', 'bet', 'MGM', 'took', 'time', 'expense', 'get', 'one', 'done', 'right', 'time', 'around', 'Mine', 'pre-order', 'can', 'hardly', 'wait', 'saddle', 'up', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'old', 'friend.Now', ""'d"", 'only', 'dust', 'off', 'other', 'classic', 'westerns', 'restore', 'remaster', 'release', 'too', 'whole', 'different', 'story', 'True', 'Grit', 'finally', 'getting', 'Blu-Ray', 'treatment', 'only', 'pending', 'release', 'theaters', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'updated', 'version', 'new', 'stars', 'had', 'be', 'kicked', 'britches', 'get', 'attention', 'original', 'True', 'Grit', 'was', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Duke', 'crime', 'way', 'old', 'classic', 'westerns', 'are', 'being', 'treated', 'studios', 'demand', 'quality', 'classic', 'westerns', 'Blu-Ray', 'there', 'studios', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'listening', 'willing', 'incur', 'expense', 'do', 'right', ""'d"", 'better', 'step', 'down', 'soap', 'box', 'now', 'get', 'upset', 'when', 'think', 'how', ""'re"", 'ignoring', 'classic', 'western', 'collectors.Update:11/24/10', 'Amazon', 'updated', 'website', 'listing', 'Blu-Ray', 'release', '181', 'minutes', '236', 'minutes', 'just', 'predicted', ""'d"", 'get', 'doin']",N/A

While I previously considered DANCES WITH WOLVES flawless, I see one particularly annoying flaw now: almost every single white man aside from Kevin Costner is either portrayed as stupid, cruel, or just plain crazy.  Now I know this movie is supposed to be from the Indians' point of view, but it's also from John Dunbar's (a white man, obviously).  Then again, this also signifies that he never truly belonged the White Man's civilization, which is why he only found piece on the open prairie and among the Lakota Sioux.  Even so, this little factor is still pretty annoying at times.That said, it is definitely Kevin Costner's best film to date (though I eagerly await his latest Western and third film as a director, OPEN RANGE).  He is one of my favorite actors, and he does his finest work here.  What's most impressive about the film is how realisitc it is.  The world of the Native Americans comes to elegant life with incredible detail (and it only cost $18.5 million to make).  The love story works incredibly well, and the cast is dazzling; you're truly transported back to the American West/Civil War.  All this if further enhanced by John Barry's Oscar-winning musical score.  Well, I guess all other reviewers have already stated everything there is to love about this film, so I'll concentrate on the actual DVD.I was awaiting MGM's Special Editon DVD with great enthusiasm.  But I was somewhat disappointed.  For starters, the picture quality is nothing to cheer about.  While sometimes it is stunning, it is all-too-often blurry and hard to focus on any objects.  The sound quality is fine, however, but still far from perfection.The extras on the second disc are also disappointing.  The massive retrospective documentary on the making of the film is kind of slow at times, and not all that intriguing.  And since this is the highlight of the extras, it's all the more crushing.  I haven't listened to any of the two commentaries yet, however.  Somehow I just haven't gotten around to listening to two four hour-long comentaries.  Go figure.Overall:  The whole reason to buy this DVD is, of course, the masterpiece film itself.  And while the extras aren't the best in the world, since I got it for $$$$ at Target I'm not all that upset.  Definitely worth buying.",5,At long last . . . . .

Costner overall attempt was to show that the plains Indians were not savages but very similar in their values to their Victorian whites.  A BIG LIE.  The plain Indians were barbaric and sadistic beyond any imagination.  It was part of their culture.  Before the settlement of the west by European immigrants, the Indians way of life was one of constant wars between the various tribes.  The losers were raped, sold as prostitutes, scalped, skinned alive and burned on the stake.  For hundred of years, they conudcted this way of life against Mexican settlements, and when the whites came from the east in the 19th century, they suffered the same fate.  A big joke in this movie is portraying the Sue as giving women equal rights, or at least, maintaining a normal marriage.  The warriors used to pick up women as they pleased, drop them, and pick up others.  I know that some of you ignorant liberals will get heart attacked reading this.  Good.

Welles' first film was the brilliant ""Citizen Kane"" and his work after that was all downhill when compared with that masterpiece and the same could be said for Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"".  One thing this 20th Anniversary Blu-ray release indicates is that sometimes no matter how long a film is it should be shown in its entirety to be fully appreciated.  I remember watching this in the cinema and as well as the shortened dvd some years later and I never liked it until I saw it here in the way it was originally intended to be screened by the director.  This has now become one of the better films that I've ever seen and the vastly improved picture and sound qualities here as compared with the old dvd that I had is like night and day.  The picture quality is not perfect as there are some weak, grainy frames especially during the night scenes but the vast majority of the film looks majestic in 1080p.  The sound quality in DTS HD MA is also very, very good making this blu-ray the definitive release and the best way to view Costner's ""Citizen Kane"".  The extra disc with special features and making of documentaries is also a nice plus and so is the cardboard slipcase.  Being a lover of Westerns myself it is always nice to watch a great film that shows the perspectives from both sides.  It's been said that there are 3 sides to every story: your side, my side and the truth and so if we truly hope to get at the truth we have to at least hear from both sides so that we can better get at the truth.Costner's best film in what is currently the best release version.Highly recommended!",5,Costner's Citizen Kane Now In Bluray Format!,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",2011,1798,"[""'m"", 'not', 'suggesting', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'rightfully', 'title', 'best', 'film', 'time', 'comparisons', 'Costner', 'Welles', 'certain', 'extent', 'do', 'fit', 'Welles', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'work', 'was', 'downhill', 'when', 'compared', 'masterpiece', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Costner', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'One', 'thing', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'release', 'sometimes', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'entirety', 'be', 'fully', 'appreciated', 'remember', 'watching', 'cinema', 'as', 'well', 'shortened', 'years', 'later', 'never', 'liked', 'saw', 'here', 'way', 'was', 'originally', 'intended', 'be', 'screened', 'director', 'now', 'become', 'one', 'better', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'vastly', 'improved', 'picture', 'sound', 'qualities', 'here', 'compared', 'old', 'dvd', 'had', 'like', 'night', 'day', 'picture', 'quality', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'weak', 'grainy', 'frames', 'especially', 'night', 'scenes', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'majestic', '1080p', 'sound', 'quality', 'DTS', 'HD', 'MA', 'also', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'blu-ray', 'definitive', 'release', 'best', 'way', 'view', 'Costner', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'extra', 'disc', 'special', 'features', 'making', 'documentaries', 'also', 'nice', 'plus', 'so', 'cardboard', 'slipcase', 'Being', 'lover', 'Westerns', 'always', 'nice', 'watch', 'great', 'film', 'perspectives', 'sides', 'been', 'said', 'are', '3', 'sides', 'story', 'side', 'side', 'truth', 'so', 'truly', 'hope', 'get', 'truth', 'have', 'least', 'hear', 'sides', 'can', 'better', 'get', 'truth.Costner', 'best', 'film', 'what', 'currently', 'best', 'release', 'version.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

A devoted Calvary Officer assigned to his post. But when he arrives he finds the post is deserted. But he is determined to complete his assignment, and to perform his duties as an officer. Soon he meets a wolf from the praire and gives him a name, ""Two socks."" As the days go by eventually he also meets up with a Sioux Indian tribe, where the holy man of the tribe befriends him. Soon he finds this holy man of the tribe has taken in a white woman and raised her from childhhood. Kevin Costner's character soon meets this white woman raised by the Sioux, who have given her the indian name of,""Stands with fist,"" and the two of them soon fall in love. By this time Kevin has been welcomed into the tribe and has even been given an indian name of ""Dances with Wolve's."" As one day an indian scouting party watch from a distance as Kevin Costner's character, John Dunbar plays and rough houses with Two Socks his pet wolf on the praire. John Dunbar becomes a member of this tribe. He soon realizes everything his been told about these people has been lies. He falls in love with them as a people and becomes part of their family, devoted to them and their belief's and their way of life.It isn't long before he learns to speak their native tongue as well. I soon found my self falling in love with them as a people my self. A very dramatic but also heartwarming and touching movie indeed.

The movie was just an instant classic. Outstanding! And it picked up a bunch of Academy Awards including best picture of 1990. Well, it earned them. Now I found the movie on the Wal-Mart $5 DVD rack. Well, now that's a bargain. I re-watched it last night and greatly enjoyed it the second time.The story involves Kevin Costner, a Union soldier, who is assigned duty at a remote outpost near the edge of the Sioux Nation in the area of southern South Dakota. He was all alone. The story tells of him cleaning up the fort and getting it ready for more soldiers. Meanwhile, the Sioux  become aware of him. Very gradually, they forge a friendship which gradually grows until he is almost part of the tribe. It's a wonderful, very human story. Quite touching, and funny.It was an excellent movie. Just outstanding. I enjoyed watching it again these 22 years later and I was overwhelmed once again. Great cinema. Movies this good don't come along very often. The photography was excellent and really captured the scenery of Badlands National Park and the contiguous area of the South Dakota Great Plains. The acting was excellent. The Sioux, in particular, really came across as genuine people and Kevin Costner as a very likable chap. The story had a nice flow to it. Well done.

And to me,at least, Dances with the Wolves can be consider a buffet. Pick of your choice, its all there and eat all you can. It is this sumptuous.Another thing, me personally at least, as an Asian viewer, who not only love and live along with different ethnicities, horse herders, nomads , farmers and aborigines along with modern cities and ancient villages, the main interesting point in watching Dances with the wolve is like watching a beautiful live documentary about the history of various Indian tribes and the Western Frontier period drama. Historical figures. Also,it is like putting me with its various people on the other side of the planet in the historical past.Then , this movie to me , is very special in that sense.I realized that the story of the movie may be fictatious, but the scenery and panoramas of the great frontier, the prairie , the buffalo hunts are visually stunning and the lifestyle and the costume of the Indians are amazingly beautiful, complicated and yet very very human,I dont know how accurate this movie is in term of  costumes and language and all, perhaps my American counterparts can tell me. But knowing Spielberg, the highly acclaimed director and his reputation, I can safely said I believe the authenticities he put into his movies.Some of my most favourite scenes are vista and the surrounding, so peaceful and quiet, when Kevin Costner in that long bouts of silent comtemplation, the Indians on the horizon line on horses, the stray lonely wolf that followed the lone soldier everywhere and the frustration and barrier of communication as well as the exchanging of gifts are inspiring, comical as well as touching.Genghiz Tanghe",5,Hauntingly beautiful,992822400,"06 18, 2001",2001,2049,"['so', 'many', 'reviews', 'given', 'will', 'then', 'go', 'straight', 'point', 'movie.For', 'admit', 'am', 'bias', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'concern', 'bias', 'sense', 'matter', 'movie', 'USA', 'China', 'Japan', 'Russia', 'aside', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'story', 'line', 'good', 'characterization', 'free', 'unwanted', 'prejudices', 'bashings', 'must', 'have', 'GREAT', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'least', 'Wolves', 'can', 'be', 'consider', 'buffet', 'Pick', 'choice', 'eat', 'can', 'sumptuous.Another', 'thing', 'personally', 'least', 'Asian', 'viewer', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'live', 'along', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'horse', 'herders', 'nomads', 'farmers', 'aborigines', 'modern', 'cities', 'ancient', 'villages', 'main', 'interesting', 'point', 'watching', 'Dances', 'wolve', 'watching', 'beautiful', 'live', 'documentary', 'history', 'various', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'Western', 'Frontier', 'period', 'drama', 'Historical', 'figures', 'Also', 'putting', 'various', 'people', 'other', 'side', 'planet', 'historical', 'past.Then', 'movie', 'very', 'special', 'sense.I', 'realized', 'story', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'fictatious', 'scenery', 'panoramas', 'great', 'frontier', 'prairie', 'buffalo', 'hunts', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'lifestyle', 'costume', 'Indians', 'are', 'amazingly', 'beautiful', 'complicated', 'yet', 'very', 'very', 'human', 'dont', 'know', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'term', 'costumes', 'language', 'perhaps', 'American', 'counterparts', 'can', 'tell', 'knowing', 'Spielberg', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'reputation', 'can', 'safely', 'said', 'believe', 'authenticities', 'put', 'movies.Some', 'most', 'favourite', 'scenes', 'are', 'vista', 'surrounding', 'so', 'peaceful', 'quiet', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'long', 'bouts', 'silent', 'comtemplation', 'Indians', 'horizon', 'line', 'horses', 'stray', 'lonely', 'wolf', 'followed', 'lone', 'soldier', 'everywhere', 'frustration', 'barrier', 'communication', 'as', 'well', 'exchanging', 'gifts', 'are', 'inspiring', 'comical', 'as', 'well', 'touching.Genghiz', 'Tanghe']",N/A

The panoramic views of the sunsets are reminiscent of David Lean's work in Lawrence Of Arabia, and the music just as lovely, if not more so. The irony here is that while the main theme in Lawrence is romantic, there's no love interest. But I digress.The Extended Cut of Dances With Wolves adds more to an already perfect masterpiece.

There are more scenes of minor and major importance not in the theatrical cut that are in the Extended Cut, but I saw the theatrical cut around August last year, so I really can't remember the specific details of every scene included in the Extended Cut which was not in the theatrical cut. Besides, even if I did remember, to say anymore would be like ruining the surprise.The only fly in the ointment for me was the profaning of God's Name (ie. combining God's Name with a mild profanity). I know soldiers spoke like that, but it wasn't common, as President Lincoln would reprimand any soldier who used such opproborious language.See both versions, and then decide for yourself which one you like best.Rated PG-13 for some scenes of gore, violence, brief sexuality and some strong religious profanity.",5,"Excellent Film.

The excess of romanticism about an outlaw who decides to rebel against the rules.There're too many elemental situations close to clich&eacute;, the story is too predictable than you'll be wondering why this movie won so many Academy awards if you compare with deepest and ambicious films , like The searchers, The naked spur, Ride the high country, Rio bravo, The man of the west, The life and times of judge Roy Bean, Sundance kid, Johnny guitar, The treasure of Sierra Madre, The wild bunch, The ballad of cable Hogue, Once upon a time in the west, or Tombstone (the best western in the last decade) to mention just a few.Don't forget that the western is the mithology of the american cinema. So having this statement in mind, it`s difficult conciliate the anti-hero figure and accept it like political correct.Thanks God that Mr. Costner thought a lot about that point and with his new film Open Range, he inscribed this film as the best western in this new century. I'm very glad about that. Because like Robert Refford and Clint Eastwood, Costner will be better remembered as director instead a standard actor And don't surprise if this new film is not so recognized like Dances, because it's too hard that another western be prized again by the Academy. It would be a record, considering that the Unforgiven won an Oscar by the best picture in 1992.The fact that four films like Dances with wolves, Unforgiven, Forrest Gump, American beauty,have been rewarding with the Oscar in just  the last decade is a point that deserves an apart mention.

White people may cringe, while those of us of other ethnicities merely nod with understanding.

This was unheard of for Hollywood filmmaking; no Lone Ranger and Tonto stereotypes here. I hope that people who haven't seen this give it a try, even if they have to rent it.There is a massacre scene (of buffalo), an attempted suicide, a shooting and police brutality; but there's just enough of it to introduce the harsh reality of prairie life in the 19th century.

This movie was credited with turning around the cinematic view of Native Americans by making them the good guy.  And to a large degree it does just that, showing the Sioux through the eyes of an outsider who grows to love and respect them while spurning the decadent culture he used to be a member of.  However, while the Sioux are portrayed wonderfully and humanely, the Pawnee come across just as badly as any ""Red Indian"" ever did in the 1950s.  They scalp a defenseless man, launch an attack on a defenseless community full of women and children, make evil-sounding war cries, etc.  Oh, and in Stands-with-a-Fist's flashback sequence, we learn that Pawnee massacred her whole family too.  This isn't really a major problem, but it is certainly something that should be thought of before heaping so much praise on the film for its ""revisionist"" leanings, especially since (as far as I'm aware) the Sioux were the masters of the Great Plains rather than the Pawnee.Nonetheless, the movie still earns a hearty 4/5 star recommendation.  While I wouldn't have minded focusing a little less on Stands With A Fist and more on the more interesting Sioux characters, I recognize that this is John Dunbar's story and she represents a large part of it.  The acting is very good (including a career-best turn by normally-iffy Kevin Costner), the action sequences are good verging on spectacular, and it comes to a very emotional but unmanipulative conclusion.

DWW is still a howlingly good movie. Its sweeping vistas of pristine western landscapes and magnificent depiction of life among the Sioux give a reasonable portrayal of what life might have been like on the American Plains before whites took over the place. The story? Kevin Costner plays Colonel Dunbar, who as a reward for a questionable act of bravery during the Civil War, choses to live in the remotest ""fort"" he could find. The place is a devastated mess, with animal carcasses choking the waterway and signs of a desperation and flight everywhere. As Dunbar sets to bring  some military order to the place, he encounters some of the local Sioux who live nearby. Gradually, he begins to learn their language, adopt their ways and learn to love them. And they him.DWW is a real period piece - by which I mean that it depicts the way Americans were ready to view the ""taming"" of the West from the vantage of the late 20th century. The film's whites are often drunk, depraved, pointlessly violent and prodigiously wasteful. The Sioux are tough, but also intelligent, loving, resourceful and brave. That this revisionist view of history is not entirely accurate is beside the point. After decades portaying Native Americans as crazed, dirty and brutal, a sympathetic depiction of the continent's first inhabitants was long overdue. It's a measure of the degree to which the pendulum is swinging the other way that 20 years later, such sentimental views come across as cloying and naive. Even this film shows the tribe as a macho patriarchy where women are second class citizensStill, the film's characters were strong and memorable. Stands With A Fist (a stunning the Mary McDonnell), taken into the tribe after a raid wiped out her family is the tribe's only white, and an obvious choice as a love interest for Dunbar. McDonnell's expertly depicted the difficulty of learning to speak a language that she hadn't spoken or heard for decades. Kicking Bird (Graham Greene) is Costner's mentor and protector and initiator into the ways of the Indians. Wind in his Hair is a tough fighter constantly tests and eventually befriends Dunbar. Ironically, only Costner's Dunbar seems bland and uninteresting in the midst of this wonderful cast. I couldn't help but to wonder whether Costner got an ego boost from playing the only white man in America whom the Sioux considered human.My main beef with Dances with Wolves, now as in 1990, was the lame ending. Costner the director can't ignore the historical fact that these noble people were virtually exterminated shortly after the events depicted in the movie. The narrative arc that Costner follows - Dunbar's psychic voyage from meaningless carnage to harmonious unity -- thus collides with the reality that American history took another path. An explanatory graphic at the end lamely brings the movie to a close, interrupting the action inexplicably and leaving every story unfinished.Nevertheless, DWW is a classic film, beautifully conceived, shot and acted. The fact that the actors who played the Sioux delivered their lines in Lakota both showed the film's respect for their culture and viewers understand the foreigness of the first encounters with them. Well worth a look, even as we reach for a more nuanced and balanced look at the colonization of the Americas.",5,Still gorgeous (with a crappy ending),1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,3449,"['college-aged', 'son', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'saw', 'theaters', '1990', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'DWW', 'still', 'howlingly', 'good', 'movie', 'sweeping', 'vistas', 'pristine', 'western', 'landscapes', 'magnificent', 'depiction', 'life', 'Sioux', 'give', 'reasonable', 'portrayal', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'American', 'Plains', 'whites', 'took', 'over', 'place', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Colonel', 'Dunbar', 'who', 'reward', 'questionable', 'act', 'bravery', 'Civil', 'War', 'live', 'remotest', 'fort', 'could', 'find', 'place', 'devastated', 'mess', 'animal', 'carcasses', 'choking', 'waterway', 'signs', 'desperation', 'flight', 'everywhere', 'Dunbar', 'sets', 'bring', 'military', 'order', 'place', 'local', 'Sioux', 'who', 'live', 'nearby', 'Gradually', 'learn', 'language', 'adopt', 'ways', 'learn', 'love', 'him.DWW', 'real', 'period', 'mean', 'way', 'Americans', 'were', 'ready', 'view', 'taming', 'West', 'vantage', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'film', 'whites', 'are', 'often', 'drunk', 'depraved', 'pointlessly', 'violent', 'prodigiously', 'wasteful', 'Sioux', 'are', 'tough', 'also', 'intelligent', 'loving', 'resourceful', 'brave', 'revisionist', 'view', 'history', 'not', 'entirely', 'accurate', 'point', 'decades', 'portaying', 'Native', 'Americans', 'crazed', 'dirty', 'brutal', 'sympathetic', 'depiction', 'continent', 'first', 'inhabitants', 'was', 'long', 'overdue', 'measure', 'degree', 'pendulum', 'swinging', 'other', 'way', '20', 'years', 'later', 'such', 'sentimental', 'views', 'come', 'cloying', 'naive', 'Even', 'film', 'tribe', 'macho', 'patriarchy', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'second', 'class', 'citizensStill', 'film', 'characters', 'were', 'strong', 'memorable', 'Fist', 'stunning', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'taken', 'tribe', 'raid', 'wiped', 'out', 'family', 'tribe', 'only', 'white', 'obvious', 'choice', 'love', 'interest', 'Dunbar', 'McDonnell', 'expertly', 'depicted', 'difficulty', 'learning', 'speak', 'language', 'had', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'heard', 'decades', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'Costner', 'mentor', 'protector', 'initiator', 'ways', 'Indians', 'Wind', 'Hair', 'tough', 'fighter', 'constantly', 'tests', 'eventually', 'Dunbar', 'Ironically', 'only', 'Costner', 'Dunbar', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'midst', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'Costner', 'got', 'ego', 'boost', 'playing', 'only', 'white', 'man', 'America', 'whom', 'Sioux', 'considered', 'human.My', 'main', 'beef', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'now', '1990', 'was', 'lame', 'ending', 'Costner', 'director', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ignore', 'historical', 'fact', 'noble', 'people', 'were', 'virtually', 'exterminated', 'shortly', 'events', 'depicted', 'movie', 'narrative', 'arc', 'Costner', 'Dunbar', 'psychic', 'voyage', 'meaningless', 'carnage', 'harmonious', 'unity', 'thus', 'collides', 'reality', 'American', 'history', 'took', 'path', 'explanatory', 'graphic', 'end', 'lamely', 'movie', 'close', 'interrupting', 'action', 'inexplicably', 'leaving', 'story', 'unfinished.Nevertheless', 'DWW', 'classic', 'film', 'beautifully', 'conceived', 'shot', 'acted', 'fact', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'Sioux', 'delivered', 'lines', 'Lakota', 'showed', 'film', 'respect', 'culture', 'viewers', 'understand', 'foreigness', 'first', 'encounters', 'Well', 'look', 'even', 'reach', 'more', 'nuanced', 'balanced', 'look', 'colonization', 'Americas']",N/A

459224,A2WJSVSBXEYEF,6305304750,Jefferson T. Packer,"[2, 7]","Dances With Wolves is a cinematic masterpiece - a tour de force almost beyond the power of words to praise or describe.This film gathers its power slowly but steadily, and unleashes it with an irresistible tidal wave of feeling that blurs the lines between a theatrical experience and a genuine outpouring of very real grief at the tragedy of the American West.When John Dunbar encounters Stands With Fist under a tree, mourning her dead husband with blood flowing from her wrist, he binds her wound with an American flag.  If the symbolism of that moment doesn't have the tears pouring down your face, nothing will.This is perhaps the first film in the history of American cinema to have the courage to represent faithfully the noble people that we destroyed in our rushed hunger for land, for gold, for riches.  In John Dunbar's transformation from army officer to honorary Lakota Sioux, we are confronted with our own failure, our own short-sightedness, in imposing our own beliefs and culture on people who needed nothing from us but to be left alone.Of course it wasn't possible.  The moment the first white man crossed the Mississippi River, the open West's days were numbered.  We encountered people who built no fences, who owned no land, who gathered no wealth and who saw the land and the animals not as something to be conquered or tamed, but as something to be worshipped.  We met these people, and in our greed-distorted vision, we saw them as savages.Dances With Wolves clears our vision, and gives us a haunting, powerful, wrenchingly-evocative glimpse of what was lost by both Indians and Whites in the clash of cultures.",5,I was and am transfixed,1143763200,"03 31, 2006",2006,1637,"['Dances', 'Wolves', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'tour', 'de', 'force', 'almost', 'power', 'words', 'praise', 'describe.This', 'film', 'gathers', 'power', 'slowly', 'steadily', 'irresistible', 'tidal', 'wave', 'feeling', 'lines', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'genuine', 'outpouring', 'very', 'real', 'grief', 'tragedy', 'American', 'West.When', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Fist', 'tree', 'mourning', 'dead', 'husband', 'blood', 'flowing', 'wrist', 'wound', 'American', 'flag', 'symbolism', 'moment', ""n't"", 'have', 'tears', 'pouring', 'down', 'face', 'nothing', 'will.This', 'perhaps', 'first', 'film', 'history', 'American', 'cinema', 'have', 'courage', 'represent', 'faithfully', 'noble', 'people', 'destroyed', 'rushed', 'hunger', 'land', 'gold', 'riches', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'transformation', 'army', 'officer', 'honorary', 'Lakota', 'Sioux', 'are', 'confronted', 'own', 'failure', 'own', 'short-sightedness', 'imposing', 'own', 'beliefs', 'culture', 'people', 'who', 'needed', 'nothing', 'be', 'left', 'alone.Of', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'possible', 'moment', 'first', 'white', 'man', 'crossed', 'Mississippi', 'River', 'open', 'West', 'days', 'were', 'numbered', 'encountered', 'people', 'who', 'built', 'fences', 'who', 'owned', 'land', 'who', 'gathered', 'wealth', 'who', 'saw', 'land', 'animals', 'not', 'something', 'be', 'conquered', 'tamed', 'something', 'be', 'worshipped', 'met', 'people', 'greed-distorted', 'vision', 'saw', 'savages.Dances', 'Wolves', 'vision', 'haunting', 'powerful', 'wrenchingly-evocative', 'glimpse', 'what', 'was', 'lost', 'Indians', 'Whites', 'clash', 'cultures']",N/A

459228,AYS05FEGASUC,6305304750,Jim Mitchell,"[10, 14]","It's easy to diminish or even forget movies like ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Field of Dreams"" if you on dwell Kevin Costner's poor career moves over the past decade.  It's almost impossible to conceive that the same guy who did ""The Postman"" or ""Waterworld"" was also part of these great films of the late 80s/early 90s (I'd throw ""The Untouchables"" and ""Bull Durham"" in there too).  I don't know where or why Kevin went wrong, but that's no reason to dismiss ""Dances With Wolves"".I hadn't seen this movie in nearly ten years- not only did I lose respect for and interest in Kevin Costner, but there are just too many movies to see and hardly enough time to watch 3 hour epics that I've already viewed.  Plus, no TV or video tape could really do it justice.  Having recently bought a low-end widescreen TV, however, I've been rewatching a lot of my favorite movies to see what they look like on a bigger, sharper screen, with the correct ratio.  ""Dances With Wolves"" was everything that I remembered, and then some.  As with many movies that I'm rewatching in widescreen, it almost seems as if it's the first time I'm seeing them.Everything about this movie, even Costner's acting, rings true.  It's a noble, exquisitely detailed and ultimately devastating film.  John Dunbar is a character that fits Kevin's rather flat and bland style perfectly- he's a basic and decent but flawed man who gradually sees the inherent goodness in the people he'd previously only known as faceless and fearsome savages.  He's intelligent and profound, but in a realistic manner befitting a front-line Civil War soldier.  The Sioux are portrayed with complexity and humanity, and without the politically correct patronizing that one might expect from a modern version of history.  They possess qualities that are both foreign and familiar to us.  Like John Dunbar, we take find great pleasure and delight as we slowly learn to connect with them. There's hardly a Native American performer in this movie that didn't deserve an Academy Award.  The noble and dignified nature of Graham Greene's character, who has a terrible inkling of what fate awaits his people, is one of the most heartbreaking performances I've ever seen.  And the scene where Wind In His Hair says farewell to Dances With Wolves by proclaiming him his friend... Well, just keep that box of Kleenex handy.The production values are also exceptional. John Barry's music, the costumes, the languages, the locations- all combine to give an authentic, genuine feel to a genre that is often dragged down by cliches and a Hollywoodized feel.  It's sad to think that if this film were made today, it would be done with flat, unrealistic looking computer generated images.  Imagine the buffalo hunt or the landscapes rendered with a computer in the hands of a misguided filmmaker who believes that technology has more value than organic, living scenes.  Hard as it is to believe, ""Dances With Wolves"" could not have been made to the same effect in the 21st Century.The four hour extended version of the movie expands on already well-developed scenes and characters.  I haven't seen it recently enough to know for certain what has been added from the original version, but this one struck me as having even more depth and detail.  Of note is a scene where the Sioux celebrate the massacre of the buffalo hunters responsible for the wasteful slaughter of the bison herd, thereby casting some doubt to Dunbar over his new friends.  An amazing scene that casts the characters in a different light- both the Indians and the white men are flawed human beings, who invoke neither complete sympathy nor total derision.  Four hours is an incredible investment for a movie, but it holds up well viewed over several sittings.  Combine that with two separate commentaries and several documentaries, and you have a very worthwhile DVD set with plenty of rewatchability.Video quality is breathtaking at times, but some secenes, especially those at night, are a bit foggy and grainy.  Sound quality is good, but doesn't have quite the depth or power in 5.1 that I would have expected.  Still, the technical aspects of the DVD are more than acceptable and sometimes nearly perfect.""Dances With Wolves"" is truly one of our greatest American films.  The emotional impact still resounds, and its messages are timeless and even timely in an age where America's place in other cultures is under question.

It loses alot  when translated to home video.Ideally it should be seen in the widescreen  version on as big a TV screen as possible.I have the collector's edition  which is letterboxed and in Dolby Surround,with nearly 60 mins. of  deleted,unseen footage and a behind the scenes documentary.It even has a  bunch of theatre lobby cards with various scenes.I don't know if the VHS  collector's edition is still available.It was a limited edition boxed set.I  don't know what the DVD edition is like.Memorable highlights were the  buffalo hunt,a truly great sequence. Composer John Barry's beautiful  score(he won the Academy Award for it).And,actor Graham Greene as the head  of the tribe.(He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.He lost to Joe  Pesci in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.)Mr.Greene was also very good in his  recurring role in the network series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; in the  early '90's.The lowlights were Kevin Costner's dull,bland  performance.(Costner's best performance was in Clint Eastwood's critically  praised but overlooked &quot;A Perfect World&quot; from 1993).Another  lowlight was actress Mary McDonnell's weird hairstyle.(I didn't realize  they had hair salons on the prairie).&quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; is  a good film but not a great western.&quot;Little Big Man&quot; from  1970,directed by Arthur Penn(1967's classic &quot;Bonnie and  Clyde&quot;),and starring Dustin Hoffman, is one of the truly all time  great epic westerns.It has the same theme as &quot;Dances With  Wolves&quot;,life with an Indian tribe in the late 1800's.In &quot;Little  Big Man&quot; the tribe are the Cheyenne.If you haven't seen it and you  liked &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; you will really appreciate  &quot;Little Big Man&quot;.Two other westerns with similar themes  that I can highly recommend are 1972's &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot; with  Robert Redford and 1976's &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; with Clint  Eastwood.

Blah, blah, blah...But this cup of tea is meant to be sipped and savored, not guzzled.I already had the special edition on VHS, and I held out buying the film's DVD until now. The special edition ""Dances With Wolves"" is a prized addition to my DVD collection.This is a rare ""extended version"" of a film in that the added scenes truly add to the story and enhance the movie-watching experience. Yes, this edition of ""Dances With Wolves"" is longer, but it is also better.Among the extra scenes, one stands out. It depicts the Sioux's brutal, some would even dare say ""savage"" side as they essentially dismember the white hunters who slaughtered bisons for their hids but let the meat rot. (We see the aftermath of what the tribe's warriors did to the hunters, not the actual killings.)All the extra footage blends well with the original ""Dances With Wolves."" This film has seamless editing, and I actually like how the time is taken to let the story unfold slowly. Too many movies seem rushed to me -- and I, in turn, feel rushed watching them.""Dances With Wolves"" gives you quiet moments to absorb the information and enjoy the absolutely majestic cinematography as the story develops.Let me also list the accolades most commonly associated with this Best Picture winner -- by those who agree it is a masterful epic: Authentic acting, glorious images and great, old-fashion story telling. And don't forget the score. The music is a perfect match for the film, and contributes greatly to settng the mood.Then there's that buffalo hunt scene, widely considered ""Dances With Wolves"" most rousing moment. It truly is among the most impressive five minutes ever captured on film, especially as you realize these big beasts are the ""real deal.""Today, directors would resort to digital animation. We are actually seeing a herd of 3,000 snorting bisons rambling across the prairie and a genuine reenactment of a Sioux buffalo hunt. Amazing!Finally, I found the featurettes on Disc 2 superior to the general Making Of... fluff tacked onto most DVDs. These ""Dances With Wolves"" documentaries are done in retrospect, 12 years removed from when the film was actually made, as Kevin Costner and practically all the other principals associated with the film look back on the film-making experience.They all seem to realize, with great pride, ""Dances With Wolves"" is their crowning achievement.

All of my life I had seen movies that either presented my tribe (the ""Sioux"" or more accurately the ""Lakota"") as a bunch of savages, or used non-Native American actors to portray ""Indian"" roles. The book, Dances with Wolves was dumb (they were Comanches???).  The movie surprised me. If it hadn't been for Kevin Costner's acting, I would give this five stars. He did a great job of directing the movie, but he came across as a total idiot in the movie ( in my opinion). What I liked most about the film was the accuracy, and use of the language (which was my first tongue), as well as the Native American cast.

Stewart""","[1, 4]","This film is very special, it touches on everything that is truly important to me: beautiful  love and friendship not just between people but also between people and animals, loyalty & dedication, harmony and victory. The cinematography is breathtaking, the music score is mesmerizing and the cast is superb, including Cisco and Two Socks.The two- disc extended edition is presented in a stylish keep case and the personal touch from Kevin Costner and Jim Wilson makes it even more special for every true fan of the movie. Some of the previously deleted scenes benefit the film. For example, the added interactions between John Dunbar and Two Socks make this unusual friendship more believable and the touching moment, when Stands With A Fist cries over her first husband's dead body gives depth to her character. In my opinion, the rest of the deleted scenes are unnecessary. The Major's outburst minutes before he shoots himself, some conversations between Ten Bears and Kicking Bird, and the prolonged preparations of Dunbar's wedding, look and feel somewhat out of place.Before I finish, I'd like to address all filmmakers. Please, be careful how much of the movie making process you reveal. Did I needed to know that Two Socks was portrayed by two different wolves and that in the scene, where the soldiers shot him, the wolf in question was chained? No, I didn't need that! Since then, every time I watch the movie, I see Two Socks in chains and I can't help it!

Written as a novel basically just for this film's screenplay by Michael Blake, this is a journey for all ages to see. There are attempts to validate the accuracy of the history or intention of this movie. I believe it would be missing the point. There are no villains or heroes (though Dunbar may be tried to be portrayed in such a light), just a view of how people of a different ethos try to survive amongst each other where suspicions and distrust run high.As an actor, this is Kevin at his best. Though solid in 'Open Range', Dance With Wolves gave Costner more of a spectrum of emotion to handle. He dealt with many situations here with a believable sense of drama. I do have one tiny detail with his character. He speaks his narration like he is proof-reading his junior-high school essay. Very flat and monotone. But maybe it done that way to enhance the onscreen action. Who knows?An intregal element to the movie was to cast exactly the right people to support the film. And no film in recent memory in my opinion handled that privilege better than here. Everyone from Kicking Bird, Stands With a Fist, Wind in His Hair right down to characters such as Smiles-A-Lot, Corporal Spivey and Black Shawl performed without flaw. The script enabled everyone to let their roles come alive.The extended scenes not in the original release, while not essential, do heighten what Blake tried to get across in the story. More importantly, I did not feel the movie dragging with the additions. I like to think of it as more movie for the dollar.The extras on the DVD are standard fare and do not penalize one's interest in the film's production. The people interviewed were frank and fun to listen to. So go ahead and pick up Dances With Wolves.

Unfortunately, I found myself wanting to fast-forward through the lengthy takes with little or no dialogue just to move the film along to its conclusion.Excellent movie, just too long.kone",3,A Visual Feast,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,779,"['Costner', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'visual', 'auditory', 'feast', 'vast', 'views', 'prairie', 'mostly', 'shot', 'early', 'morning', 'evening', 'bring', 'out', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'Combining', 'John', 'Barry', 'extraordinary', 'musical', 'score', 'visual', 'again', '5-star', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'musical', 'score', 'scenic', 'vistas', 'can', 'not', 'carry', 'entire', 'movie', 'Frankly', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'tighter', 'editing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'all-round', '5-star', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'significantly', 'made', 'compelling', 'moving', 'story', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'wanting', 'fast-forward', 'lengthy', 'little', 'dialogue', 'just', 'move', 'film', 'conclusion.Excellent', 'movie', 'just', 'too', 'long.kone']",N/A

This film, despite it being his directorial debut, is all about the Indians -- not him. I loved this movie, as love all epic films! (I loved BRAVEHEART, but hate Mel Gibson!)...Now that that is out of my system as a regular viewer, I will play the unbiased critic.First off, DANCES WITH WOLVES is a beautiful, passionate film that swept away the audience, critics, and the Academy Awards. (FYI: Something my film PRISONER OF WAR will do in the very near future.) It is a special tale of Sioux Indians and their culture clash with the Americans who raped, murdered, destroyed, and stole this land away from them. They are obvious stereotypes in this film, amongst them are the physical aspects of the American soldiers. They are fat, sweaty, loud, rude, thieving, and obnoxious; while the (Pawnee) Indians are portrayed as savage, blood-thirsty killers -- and maybe they were! Maybe the Sioux Indians were killers, or peaceful people. Who knows?It begins with Lt. John J. Dunbar (Costner), a Union officer, in the battlefields during the Civil War in 1863. He is able to lead the charge against the Confederate soldiers and score a victory. He is then reassigned to another location out in the valleys of the Midwest. Eventually, he makes contact with a Sioux Indian. Soon, word gets back to the other Indians of the white man and they advance forward with their investigation. Dunbar is nervous at first, as are the Indians (though, skeptical would be a better word), but they eventually come around and celebrate the return of Tatanka (Sioux for buffalo).The film is supported by a interesting cast including: Mary McDonnell as Stands With a Fist, an American woman who was adopted by the Sioux after her family was murdered by Pawnee Indians in a flashabck sequence. (In the book, she is referred to as Christine.) She eventually falls for Dunbar and they get married. Graham Greene (not the novelist) is Kicking Bird, the Indian to make contact with Dunbar, and the holy man of his tribe. The rest of the cast are regular character actors playing the Indians (yes, some of them speak perfect English) and the soldiers. But an extra point goes to Murphy Brown's Robert Pastorelli for his hilarious turn as the foul and foul-mouthed Timmons.In the end, Dunbar changes his name to Dances With Wolves; he gets captured by the Union soldiers; and eventually is freed when the Sioux, his new family, come to rescue him. It is an excellent film created by a man I cannot stand to look at or watch on the screen. But, like I said about Gibson, my hat's off to Costner.Winner of 7 Academy Awards in 1990 include: Best Picture - Jim Wilson &amp; Kevin Costner; Best Director - Kevin Costner; Best Adapted Screenplay - Michael Blake, based on his own novel; Best Cinematography - Dean Semler; Best Sound - Jeffrey Perkins, Bill W. Benton, Greg Watkins, &amp; Russell Williams II; Best Film Editing - Neil Travis; and Best Score - John Barry.But, my film, PRISONER OF WAR, will be much better!

Knowing more about the subject now, than I did then, I am a little more critical.Visually, this is still stunning and doesn't get boring despite its length.  It also still merits praise for being the first movie to cast all American Indians in the American Indian rolls, and to have tried, at least, to show a little bit about the American Indian culture of the time, and to have the Indians play a major roll, beyond simply attacking wagon trains.However, the story is little romanticized, historically speaking. The impression it gives is that the Lakota (Sioux) were totally isolated from whites at the time, knowing nothing about them, and that the white lieutenant introduces them to guns during their fight with the Pawnee.  But judging from the time frame given in the movie (during the Civil War and 13 years before Crazy Horse's surrender) the year would be about 1864.  By that time the gun was already in use by the Lakota for quite some time.As for isolation, the Grattan Fight, usually seen as the beginning of the long hostilities with the Plains Indians, took place in 1854 when the Lakota and some others were camped outside of Fort Laramie waiting for the arrival of annuities agreed upon in an earlier treaty. Indeed trade goods, such as calico for clothing and iron cooking pots would have been much more prevalent than they appeared in the film.Also, if I remember correctly, in the book, the lieutenant actually stays with the Cheyenne, not Lakota, which would explain some references that seemed out of place in this context.Of course one criticism I had the first time I saw this, and that still remains, is Kevin Costner's voice.  While he looked the part, and did a pretty good acting job, to me he always sounds like a twelve-year-old, and with a movie that depended so much on narration, that was a big draw back.In all, the movie still merits watching.

459266,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6305304750,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[15, 18]","I can appreciate the idea that ""Dances with Wolves"" is an example of cinematic revisionist history, if not an outright case of affirmative action that instantiates the idea of the ""noble savage"" that once held sway among the European settlers of the New World.  But Hollywood has been reinterpreting the Old West in light of changing socio-political beliefs for decades.  Just look at the changing story of Custer at the Little Big Horn from ""Them Died With Their Boots On"" to ""Little Big Man"" to ""Son of the Morning Star.""  With Kevin Costner's film the Western was elevated to a level that hitherto had not been approached in American cinema.It is ""Little Big Man,"" along with ""A Man Called Horse,"" that are clearly the cinematic ancestors of ""Dances with Wolves.""  All three deal with a white man who finds a home among a Native American tribe, but where this 1990 film differs is that it is also an epic, at which point we are talking ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West.""  Yet ""Dances With Wolves"" is a significant step beyond all of those films.  ""Little Big Man"" was a black comedy and not an epic, ""A Man Called Horse"" was about an English aristocrat and not an American soldier, ""How the West Was Won"" was about Manifest Destiny and not the destruction of an indigenous culture, and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" was operatic and not grounded in history, albiet a romanticized one.Michael Blake's screenplay is based on his novel, and it is the film's prologue that I find most problematic.  The idea is to establish Costner's John Dunbar as being someone special from the start, so that the Union soldier who could survive a hail of Confederate bullets becomes the man that could befriend a wild wolf on the Plains.  It is also establishes Dunbar as a man who is searching for something, and not merely an alternative to the horrors of war but more importantly a reason for living.  Whereas the rest of the film takes its time to develop things this initial part is relatively rushed, but the excuse for putting Dunbar in the middle of the Dakotas on a deserted military post is secondary to what happens once he is there.The greatest strength of ""Dances with Wolves"" is that Dunbar's interactions with the Sioux (really the Lakotas, but the film uses the more familiar but erroneous name for these Native Americans), are defined by a series of relationships with clearly defined characters.  Although his romance with Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell) is a major plot line, and her being a white woman raised by the tribe a useful contrivance for allowing the two sides to communicate, the relationship that really stands out is between Dunbar and Kicking Bird (Graham Greene).  This is because the two are kindred spirits, each willing to be open to the other and committed to understanding the other on his own terms.  The opposite position is taken by Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), but even he forges a relationship with the man who is given the Sioux name Dances With Wolves.Then there are the relationships with both the tribal elders, such as Chief Ten Bears (Floyd Red Crow Westerman), and the youngsters, including Smiles a Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse).  What makes these characters so compelling is that they are utterly devoid of caricature and that the performances seem so real and provide such a sense of dignity.  There are moments of warmth and humor throughout the film, both springing from this same source.  It is ironic that while the film won seven Oscars, none of them were for acting (Costner, Greene, and McDonnell were all nominated).Because Dunbar is all alone at his post, he begins keeping a journal.  This simple device allows the film to take advantage of Dunbar's narration to advance both the story and the message.  What would seem stilted as a monologue works perfectly well in the context of a written journal entry.  In the last act of the film the journal becomes part of the story as well, not only as a symbol of the disdain most white men have for the Indians and their culture, but as a testament to what is being lost.  Dunbar decides to come West because he wants to see it before it is gone (even though the time frame here is the 1860s and the Civil War), and the final point of the film is that the Sioux were only years away from being herded to reservations.  One of the great ironies of the story is that it is Dunbar, the only white man the Sioux have ever known, who gives them their death sentence when he tells them that as many white as there are stars in the sky are coming.There are two major action sequences in the film, the buffalo hunt and Pawnee attack, but they are really not the most impressive parts of the film.  That Dunbar would be invited to go on the hunt or that he would organize the defense of the village, are ultimately more important in the film.  Dunbar is heroic because he is, in the best meaning of the term, human.  Costner won the Oscar for best director, but clearly his strength is in telling the story and keeping the characters real rather than in coming up with pretty pictures, althought Australian cinematographer Dean Semler comes up with plenty of those, especially when he takes advantage of a brilliant sunset as a backdrop.  ""Dances with Wolves"" is epic in its scope, but it has an attention to detail that few Westerns can rival, which it why it was the first film since ""Cimarron"" in 1931 to win the Best Picture Oscar.",5,Kevin Costner creates a truly epic American Western,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,5461,"['can', 'appreciate', 'idea', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'example', 'cinematic', 'revisionist', 'history',

He employed numerous native Americans, asked for their advice regularly, and used their native language in the film. It's easy to forget now that, at the time, most movies about native Americans involved those individuals waving at tomahawk around and promptly dying. Dancing with Wolves was one of the first movies to really show the native American side of things, to help watchers get a sense of appreciation for their culture.Lieutenant Dunbar - Costner - has had enough of war. He tries to commit suicide, fails, and volunteers to go out to the far west. Here he's assigned a run down, empty fort to guard. Soon he's becoming friends with the local tribe, and he quickly becomes restored by their down to earth style of living. There is a white woman as part of the tribe, and the two fall in love.Yes there are the ""oh so good"" Sioux and the ""oh so evil"" Pawnee. There's only so much a movie can do to cross hurdles. We at least still have a native American group we are rooting for - and at times we're rooting against the ""evil Army"" which is fairly unheard of in movies back then.I've ended up watching this at least 20 times. First, I write books on courtship practices and one is on the Native American practices. Since this movie was fairly well researched, I included it on my movie listings. Second, a college course I took had us watch this movie and examine the cultural interactions. The professor was convinced that the enemy tribe was NOT Pawnee so I had to watch it several times including the various director cuts to get the proof that they were in fact clearly referred to as Pawnee. The professor was also convinced that the teen boy, Smiles a Lot, was a homosexual. To me he was simply a boy trying to prove himself repeatedly to the men in the tribe, and over time he does earn their respect.

(Like even incompetent soldiers would waste valuable ammunition killing animals for no reason.

Not only did this film dispel such nonsense, but a year later, Clint Eastwood's brilliant &quot;Unforgiven&quot; also garnered the Oscar for Best Motion Picture.Dances with Wolves tells the story of John Dunbar, a dissillusioned Civil War &quot;hero&quot; who wants to see the frontier &quot;before it disappears.Dunbar quickly makes a home for himself in a deserted and forgotten fort on a quiet sandy area on the plains, where he prefers the company of his horse and nature to the harshness of the civil war, which is continuing to rage back east.In time, Dunbar meets his &quot;neighbours&quot; - the plains tribe, the Sioux - and it is the interaction and relationships which develop between this soldier and the Sioux, which propels this movie to greatness. It is interesting to see the difference in the relationship between Dundar and Winds-In-His-Hair, the warrior, who wants nothing to do with the &quot;white intruders&quot; on his land. However, the &quot;holy man&quot; of the tribe, Kicking Bird, looks at Dunbar with a sense of curiousity and &quot;sadness (he understands that more white men will eventually come to settle their land) and over time, establishes a very special relationship with him.Dances With Wolves works on so many levels that it's not at all surprising that the film was both an artistic and commercial success.You have a rousing adventure film with battles and a buffalo hunt that is absolutely breathtaking in its realism. The scenes are so well depicted that you almost have the sensation of riding at a breakneck pace along side the thundering herd.Of course, there's a romance element as Dunbar falls in love with Stands-With-Fist, the adopted daughter of Kicking Bird, who has recently lost her husband.You have to admire the integrity and guts that Costner showed in making a film in a genre that was essentially dead. It's doubtful that he would have found the money if this film hadn't come on the heels of The Untouchables and Field of Dreams, for example, which had secured his reputation in Hollywood at the time as a major bankable star.This film was made at the height of Costner's popularity and turkeys like Waterworld, 3000 Miles To Graceland and The Postman were still far off in the future.However, notwithstanding the above, if Costner never did another thing in Hollywood, he can look back on this epic film that he was primarily responsible for and be very, very proud.",5,Costner's Finest Moment,1059868800,"08 3, 2003",2003,2703,"['stunning', 'motion', 'picture', 'worthy', 'accolades', 'awards', '7', 'academy', 'awards..', 'received.It', 'ironic', 'Costner', 'had', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'financial', 'backing', 'film', 'belonged', 'genre', 'was', 'considered', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'fashion', 'quot', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'film', 'dispel', 'such', 'nonsense', 'year', 'later', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'brilliant', 'quot', 'Unforgiven', 'quot', 'also', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Motion', 'Picture.Dances', 'Wolves', 'story', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'dissillusioned', 'Civil', 'War', 'quot', 'hero', 'quot', 'who', 'see', 'frontier', 'quot', 'quickly', 'home', 'deserted', 'forgotten', 'fort', 'quiet', 'sandy', 'area', 'plains', 'where', 'company', 'horse', 'nature', 'harshness', 'civil', 'war', 'continuing', 'rage', 'back', 'east.In', 'time', 'Dunbar', 'quot', 'quot', 'plains', 'tribe', 'Sioux', 'interaction', 'relationships', 'develop', 'soldier', 'Sioux', 'movie', 'greatness', 'interesting', 'see', 'difference', 'relationship', 'Dundar', 'Winds-In-His-Hair', 'warrior', 'who', 'nothing', 'do', 'quot', 'white', 'intruders', 'quot', 'land', 'However', 'quot', 'man', 'quot', 'tribe', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'Dunbar', 'sense', 'curiousity', 'quot', 'sadness', 'more', 'white', 'men', 'will', 'eventually', 'come', 'settle', 'land', 'time', 'very', 'special', 'relationship', 'him.Dances', 'Wolves', 'works', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'not', 'surprising', 'film', 'was', 'artistic', 'commercial', 'success.You', 'have', 'rousing', 'adventure', 'film', 'battles', 'buffalo', 'hunt', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'realism', 'scenes', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'depicted', 'almost', 'have', 'sensation', 'riding', 'breakneck', 'pace', 'side', 'thundering', 'herd.Of', 'course', 'romance', 'element', 'Dunbar', 'love', 'Stands-With-Fist', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'husband.You', 'have', 'admire', 'integrity', 'guts', 'Costner', 'showed', 'making', 'film', 'genre', 'was', 'essentially', 'dead', 'doubtful', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'money', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'come', 'heels', 'Untouchables', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'example', 'had', 'secured', 'reputation', 'Hollywood', 'time', 'major', 'bankable', 'star.This', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'height', 'Costner', 'popularity', 'turkeys', 'Waterworld', '3000', 'Miles', 'Graceland', 'Postman', 'were', 'still', 'far', 'future.However', 'notwithstanding', 'above', 'Costner', 'never', 'did', 'thing', 'Hollywood', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'epic', 'film', 'was', 'primarily', 'responsible', 'be', 'very', 'very', 'proud']",N/A

459291,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,6305304750,"Matthew Higdon ""California Chariot""","[6, 8]","The winner of 7 Academy Awards, Kevin Costner's panoramic frontier epic DANCES WITH WOLVES is a rich and masterful blend of scenery, story, culture, personality, and friendship.Following an act of interpreted bravery in the Civil War, Lt. John Dunbar is restationed to a deserted and delapidated Army fort, somewhere in the vast expanse of the unsettled Dakotas. He soon encounters a local tribe of Sioux Indians. Though initially distrustful, both sides begin to work, however slowly, at conquering their fears and prejudices. As Dunbar grows closer to the community, he makes efforts to learn their ways: language and dress, buffalo hunts and bonfire dances. His developing romance with a tribal woman blossoms into marriage. The Sioux leaders fear, all the while, that more `whites' are coming, to take and drive them off their lands, and the society's holy man suspects that Dunbar himself knows as much. What is more, the U.S. Army has initiated pursuit of the former lieutenant, branding him a traitor. Eventually, Dunbar must choose between remaining with the Sioux ... or departing from their company, rerouting military parties in order to safeguard Sioux culture and life.The story is strong; the characters are distinctive and transparent; the script, smart and focused. The costumes, setting, transportation and tools-of-the-day all appear very authentic. Thus, it captures the time period (and location) extremely well. And here, it is all the better, because the movie is about those times, and what happened during them. The mood carefully shifts from a somber quality to soft cheeriness to cautious triumphant score, and back again. The film itself makes excellent use of cinematography, with grand, sweeping shots of the plains and hills, especially during the daytime buffalo chase. Unlike so many other Hollywood movies, first-hand acquaintance with ""the girl"" does not turn into romance in a few short days or hours. Nearly everything takes SOME time to develop, to change, to grow.Costner's depictions seem to be largely accurate: the Sioux and many other indigenous societies in the Midwest and elsewhere were being pushed west, captured, or wiped out. However, he does come close to generalizing the `whites' as senseless, brutal, and enormously characteristically savage, almost like a race of monsters. While in fact various numberless persons - at both common and political levels - perpetrated attrocities and relocation efforts that, sadly, came out of westward expansion's predominant attitude of callous disregard for the native peoples and ecosystems of central North America - it would be inaccurate, as well as unfair, to say that such actions (or even attitudes) constituted phenomena universal to the white settlers.Yet, on the whole, Costner has done a superb job of recreating the era, the peoples (generally), their ways of life, and the ideologies that motivated their actions. He has brought to life and memory the richness and humanity of a people all but forgotten ... and a partial portrayal of events which made, arguably, for the sadest chapter in the two-hundred-plus years of American history.This film ranks among the very best Westerns made.DVD Features: Audio Commentary (Kevin Costner, Jim Wilson), theatrical trailers, and scene selection.",5,Dancing at the Oscars,1105315200,"01 10, 2005",2005,3291,"['winner', '7', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'panoramic', 'frontier', 'epic', 'DANCES', 'WITH', 'WOLVES', 'rich', 'masterful', 'blend', 'scenery', 'story', 'culture', 'personality', 'friendship.Following', 'act', 'interpreted', 'bravery', 'Civil', 'War', 'Lt.', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'restationed', 'deserted', 'delapidated', 'Army', 'fort', 'somewhere', 'vast', 'expanse', 'unsettled', 'Dakotas', 'soon', 'local', 'tribe', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'Though', 'initially', 'distrustful', 'sides', 'begin', 'work', 'however', 'slowly', 'conquering', 'fears', 'prejudices', 'Dunbar', 'closer', 'community', 'efforts', 'learn', 'ways', 'language', 'dress', 'buffalo', 'hunts', 'bonfire', 'dances', 'developing', 'romance', 'tribal', 'woman', 'blossoms', 'marriage', 'Sioux', 'leaders', 'fear', 'while', 'more', 'whites', 'are', 'coming', 'take', 'drive', 'off', 'lands', 'society', 'holy', 'man', 'Dunbar', 'as', 'much', 'What', 'more', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'initiated', 'pursuit', 'former', 'lieutenant', 'branding', 'traitor', 'Eventually', 'Dunbar', 'must', 'choose', 'remaining', 'Sioux', 'departing', 'company', 'rerouting', 'military', 'parties', 'order', 'safeguard', 'Sioux', 'culture', 'life.The', 'story', 'strong', 'characters', 'are', 'distinctive', 'transparent', 'script', 'smart', 'focused', 'costumes', 'setting', 'transportation', 'tools-of-the-day', 'appear', 'very', 'authentic', 'Thus', 'time', 'period', 'location', 'extremely', 'well', 'here', 'better', 'movie', 'times', 'what', 'happened', 'mood', 'carefully', 'shifts', 'somber', 'quality', 'soft', 'cheeriness', 'cautious', 'triumphant', 'score', 'back', 'again', 'film', 'excellent', 'use', 'cinematography', 'grand', 'sweeping', 'shots', 'plains', 'hills', 'especially', 'daytime', 'buffalo', 'chase', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'first-hand', 'acquaintance', 'girl', 'not', 'turn', 'romance', 'few', 'short', 'days', 'hours', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'SOME', 'time', 'develop', 'change', 'grow.Costner', 'depictions', 'seem', 'be', 'largely', 'accurate', 'Sioux', 'many', 'other', 'indigenous', 'societies', 'Midwest', 'elsewhere', 'were', 'being', 'pushed', 'west', 'captured', 'wiped', 'out', 'However', 'come', 'close', 'generalizing', 'whites', 'senseless', 'brutal', 'enormously', 'characteristically', 'savage', 'almost', 'race', 'monsters', 'fact', 'various', 'numberless', 'persons', 'common', 'political', 'levels', 'perpetrated', 'attrocities', 'relocation', 'efforts', 'sadly', 'came', 'westward', 'expansion', 'predominant', 'attitude', 'callous', 'disregard', 'native', 'peoples', 'ecosystems', 'central', 'North', 'America', 'would', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'as', 'well', 'unfair', 'say', 'such', 'actions', 'even', 'attitudes', 'constituted', 'phenomena', 'universal', 'white', 'settlers.Yet', 'whole', 'Costner', 'done', 'superb', 'job', 'recreating', 'era', 'peoples', 'generally', 'ways', 'life', 'ideologies', 'motivated', 'actions', 'brought', 'life', 'memory', 'richness', 'humanity', 'people', 'forgotten', 'partial', 'portrayal', 'events', 'made', 'arguably', 'sadest', 'chapter', 'two-hundred-plus', 'years', 'American', 'history.This', 'film', 'ranks', 'very', 'best', 'Westerns', 'made.DVD', 'Features', 'Audio', 'Commentary', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'Jim', 'Wilson', 'theatrical', 'trailers', 'scene', 'selection']",N/A

It tells the story of Union army officer John Dunbar who, disillusioned with the bloody civil war in the east, requests to be posted to a remote western outpost. He arrives to find the fort totally deserted with no sign of the garrison. His only companions are his trusty horse Cisco and a unusually friendly wolf he names Two-Socks. He soon makes contact with a band of Souix Indians who are at first curious but highly suspicious of the lone white man in their land. He finally rides out to make formal contact with them which eventually leads to friendship and acceptance by the tribe. Over time, he develops close friendships with several members of the clan, particularly Kicking Bird, the village holy man, Wind In His Hair, a stoic and powerful warrior, and Stands With a Fist, a white woman raised by Kicking Bird's family. Dumbar undertakes a journey of self-discovery as he grows ever closer to his new Indian friends, accompanying them on a buffalo hunt, defending the village against a Pawnee attack, and eventually marrying into the tribe. Slowly but surely, he ceases to be what he has always been, a white soldier named John Dunbar until all that remians is a Souix named Dances With Wolves. In the end, he must make a choice to defend his new friends or return to his old life and assist in the decimation of the Indians and their land.Dances With Wolves is a beautiful film with strong characters and lush landscapes. Costner is in his element here as the soft spoken reluctant hero who must make serious life choices in the face of overwhelming odds. This movie definately embraces Rousseau's idea of the ""Noble Savage"" as the Souix are presented here as a proud and innocent people, unencumbered by vice, and threatened by an ever expanding flood of whites driven by the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Whether this is a factual depiction of the Indians is open to debate, but it cannot be denied that we are given a genuinely sympathetic picture of life on the plains and a desire to see Dunbar and his Indian allies hold back the inevitable...",5,"""I want to see the Frontier...Before It's Gone.""",1011830400,"01 24, 2002",2002,2172,"['tale', 'frontier', 'last', 'days', 'native', 'culture', 'west', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'story', 'Union', 'army', 'officer', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'who', 'disillusioned', 'bloody', 'civil', 'war', 'east', 'requests', 'be', 'posted', 'remote', 'western', 'outpost', 'find', 'fort', 'totally', 'deserted', 'sign', 'garrison', 'only', 'companions', 'are', 'trusty', 'horse', 'Cisco', 'unusually', 'friendly', 'wolf', 'Two-Socks', 'soon', 'contact', 'band', 'Souix', 'Indians', 'who', 'are', 'first', 'curious', 'highly', 'suspicious', 'lone', 'white', 'man', 'land', 'finally', 'out', 'make', 'formal', 'contact', 'eventually', 'friendship', 'acceptance', 'tribe', 'time', 'close', 'friendships', 'several', 'members', 'clan', 'particularly', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'village', 'holy', 'man', 'Wind', 'Hair', 'stoic', 'powerful', 'warrior', 'Fist', 'white', 'woman', 'raised', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'family', 'Dumbar', 'journey', 'self-discovery', 'ever', 'closer', 'new', 'Indian', 'friends', 'accompanying', 'buffalo', 'hunt', 'defending', 'village', 'Pawnee', 'attack', 'eventually', 'marrying', 'tribe', 'Slowly', 'surely', 'be', 'what', 'always', 'been', 'white', 'soldier', 'named', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Souix', 'named', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'end', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'defend', 'new', 'friends', 'return', 'old', 'life', 'assist', 'decimation', 'Indians', 'land.Dances', 'Wolves', 'beautiful', 'film', 'strong', 'characters', 'lush', 'landscapes', 'Costner', 'element', 'here', 'soft', 'spoken', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'who', 'must', 'make', 'serious', 'life', 'choices', 'face', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'movie', 'definately', 'Rousseau', 'idea', 'Noble', 'Savage', 'Souix', 'are', 'presented', 'here', 'proud', 'innocent', 'people', 'unencumbered', 'vice', 'threatened', 'ever', 'expanding', 'flood', 'whites', 'driven', 'dreams', 'Manifest', 'Destiny', 'factual', 'depiction', 'Indians', 'open', 'debate', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'denied', 'are', 'given', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'picture', 'life', 'plains', 'desire', 'see', 'Dunbar', 'Indian', 'allies', 'hold', 'back', 'inevitable']",N/A

Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[204, 225]","Kevin Costner directed, produced and starred in the 1990 western epic ""Dances with Wolves"", which was based upon the novel of the same name by author Michael Blake, who also wrote the film's screenplay.  Costner plays U.S. Army Lieutenant John G. Dunbar during and shortly after the U.S. Civil War.  Following a victory with Union troops under his command, he requests an assignment to the western frontier and is assigned to an isolated military outpost in the Dakota Territory.  John waits patiently for other troops to arrive at the outpost, but they never do.  With no means to communicate with his superiors, John bides his time by taking care of the outpost and himself, as well as writing in his journal.  A nearby wolf begins to take an interest in John.  At first, he tries to chase the wolf away, but eventually, the wolf becomes John's unwitting companion.  Later, John realizes that there is a nearby Native American Sioux tribe.  Members of the tribe meet John, but since they do not have a common language to speak with one another, they are somewhat suspicious of him.  Later, they invite John to visit their encampment where he sees a Caucasian woman (Mary McDonnell) living with them.  She remembers a little English is able to talk with him and tells him that her name is Stands With A Fist.  Eventually, John learns how to speak Sioux and is adopted by the tribe after he helps them.Originally released at 183 minutes (three hours), the film may seem long; but the characters, story and cinematography keep most viewers fully engaged.  The extended director's version is even longer at 236 minutes (four hours).  The primary Sioux characters are Kicking Bird (Graham Greene, whose career in film was boosted greatly by this film), Wind in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), the elder Ten Bears (Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman) and Black Shawl (Tantoo Cardinal).  The film won seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director (Kevin Costner), Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Best Sound and Best Writing--Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Michael Blake).  Kevin Costner received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Graham Greene was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Mary McDonnell was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.Overall, I rate ""Dances with Wolves"" with 5 out of 5 stars not only for being a very engaging film, but also for its very positive portrayal of Native American life in the former western frontier.  Some people may find the film too long, some may be offended by the negative portrayal of U.S. Army soldiers and some may be offended by the negative portrayal of Pawnee tribespeople. Unfortuneately, none of Costner's works following ""Dances with Wolves"" have been as good.  Films that Costner only starred in such as ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" (1991), ""A Perfect World"" (1993) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) were entertaining; but films that he both starred in and directed were box office disasters: ""Waterworld"" (1995) and ""The Postman"" (1997).

I originally saw it in a theater when it was first released, and liked it well enough, but the additional footage gives the film an extra dimension.One of the criticisms of the original version was that other than the main character the white people in the movie were disproportionately bigoted, brutal and ignorant.  There was some validity to this, although the soldiers and doctors in the opening battle scene certainly weren't portrayed unsympathetically and the plot included a group of ""bad guy"" Native Americans.  However, the additional scenes in the expanded version do provide a wider range of white characters including the soldiers who vacate the fort.Anyone expecting to see a POV of the 19th century western expansion period that you see in older Westerns will be disappointed, however.  Historically both movies and TV have considerably sanitized that entire era and presented it as the victors wanted it seen.  As much as many us may still love movies like ""The Searchers"" or ""High Noon"", the fact remains that mid-19th century Americans (and the colonial Europeans as well for that matter) were grossly racist by even conservative modern standards and remained ignorant of native culture for more than two centuries after the excuse of culture shock had expired.  Native Americans had basically committed the same 'sin' as the Canaanites in the Old Testament: they had land an invading group wanted and so had to be demonized as ""dirty, godless savages.""With over 400 reviews, the plot of this film has been pretty much covered, which is why I'm omitting that.",5,Expanded version is a huge improvement,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1719,"['have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'yet', 'have', 'do', 'invest', 'little', 'extra', 'viewing', 'time', 'expanded', '236-minute', 'edition', 'originally', 'saw', 'theater', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'additional', 'footage', 'film', 'extra', 'dimension.One', 'criticisms', 'original', 'version', 'was', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'white', 'people', 'movie', 'were', 'disproportionately', 'bigoted', 'brutal', 'ignorant', 'was', 'validity', 'soldiers', 'doctors', 'opening', 'battle', 'scene', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'unsympathetically', 'plot', 'included', 'group', 'bad', 'guy', 'Native', 'Americans', 'However', 'additional', 'scenes', 'expanded', 'version', 'do', 'provide', 'wider', 'range', 'white', 'characters', 'including', 'soldiers', 'who', 'vacate', 'fort.Anyone', 'expecting', 'see', 'POV', '19th', 'century', 'western', 'expansion', 'period', 'see', 'older', 'Westerns', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'however', 'Historically', 'movies', 'TV', 'have', 'considerably', 'sanitized', 'entire', 'era', 'presented', 'victors', 'wanted', 'seen', 'As', 'much', 'many', 'may', 'still', 'love', 'movies', 'Searchers', 'High', 'Noon', 'fact', 'mid-19th', 'century', 'Americans', 'colonial', 'Europeans', 'as', 'well', 'matter', 'were', 'grossly', 'racist', 'even', 'conservative', 'modern', 'standards', 'remained', 'ignorant', 'native', 'culture', 'more', 'two', 'centuries', 'excuse', 'culture', 'shock', 'had', 'expired', 'Native', 'Americans', 'had', 'basically', 'committed', 'same', ""'sin"", 'Canaanites', 'Old', 'Testament', 'had', 'land', 'invading', 'group', 'wanted', 'so', 'had', 'be', 'demonized', 'dirty', 'godless', 'savages', '400', 'reviews', 'plot', 'film', 'been', 'pretty', 'much', 'covered', 'why', ""'m"", 'omitting']",N/A

In scope and size, this is one galliant, masterfully directed motion picture and the well-deserving recipient of 9 Academy Awards.  PLOT: After surviving a suicide charge on the field of honor, Major John Dunbar travels to the west, establishing a life-long friendship with the Sioux Indians.Originally running nearly three hours in theaters, a full hour of footage was excised to keep the already elephantine running time manageable.  For years, on VHS and DVD, only the theatrical cut of this film has been made available, though Image laserdisc did release the full 3 hr. 58 min. version in a deluxe box set back in the mid-1990's.  That fully restored running time is finally given the full digital treatment via this DVD release.  Too lengthy to fit on one side of a DVD, MGM has spread the feature film over two sides on the first disc.  Since no intermission was ever intended, the cut comes about midway through and is obtrusive to your viewing experience.  However, as there is no other way to ensure the intregity of compression artifacts, this cut is, if not forgiveable, at least palpable.MGM DVD has done a very nice job on remastering &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.  The original DVD from Image Entertainment had deeper contrast and black levels, but adjusting the contrast on one's television corrects the softer levels on this disc.  Shadow delineation is beautifully rendered.  Colors are vibrant, bold and accurate.  Some minor edge enhancement occurs but shimmering and pixelization are at a bare minimum. The audio is 5.1 and pretty much the same mix as the original Image DVD.EXTRAS: Audio commentaries that are, for the most part, interesting, an all-new production featurette, the original featurette and a host of other well-meaning, though rather lack luster extras that have merely been designed to fill up space on disc #2.  I must also give MGM less than top marks for their packaging. After the handsomely bound &quot;West Side Story&quot; special edition I was perhaps expecting too much to think that, even though a leather bound case would be out of the question for &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, at the very least we'd get something stronger in faux leather (like the &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; disc packaging) than the flimsy, barely cardboard, shell we do get  with its Velcro snapper.  Taaa-cky!BOTTOM LINE: This is the definitive version of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;.

I can't praise this movie enough, and every time I watch it, it brings me back to where I belong.It's the story of Civil War Union Army Lt. John Dunbar (Kevin Costner), who after being designated a hero, chooses to be stationed on the western frontier ""before it's gone"". He arrives only to find a deserted post on the Dakota plains and believes he will be sent reinforcements later. He becomes friendly with a lone wolf he calls Two Socks, and forms a tentative relationship with members of a nearby Lakota Sioux tribe. Time passes, the troops don't show, and Dunbar spends more and more time with the Lakota. He eventually unites with them, becomes an honorary member of the tribe, and joins them and their way of life.Dances With Wolves was also directed by Kevin Costner, and he really did his homework for this one, going the extra mile to make this a realistic  portrayal of the 19th century Lakota Sioux people. The actors that portray the Sioux are Native Americans who speak Lakota in the movie (with English subtitles), and the clothing, weapons, and customs are all accurately replicated. There is even a realistic and exciting buffalo hunt that is actually quite a film making accomplishment.The central character here is played by Costner, but the real star of the movie is Graham Greene, who plays Kicking Bird, the temperate and wise Lakota medicine man (Greene was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor).This is a serious movie, but instead of being preachy and driven, it's compassionate and deliberate. The story and the relationships are given time to develop, making the highly unlikely circumstances a little easier to digest and the characters more familiar and interesting.There is nothing political at all about Dances With Wolves. There's no lecture. It's just the story of a white man who finds that what he's been conditioned to believe about ""the enemy"" is not true at all. As he gets to know them and observe their way of life, he sees them for what they really are. People.The scenery in the movie is breathtaking, the music is beautifully moving, and the acting is captivating and balanced. Dances With Wolves won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture. And I personally like Dances With Wolves so much that I can't imagine enjoying another movie as much as I've enjoyed this one over the years.",5,"(and 5 more stars) AN EPIC.

If by chance you haven't already seen Dances With Wolves or haven't at least heard about it then there are already hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews already written that go into detail about the film itself. At this point I really dont think I can significantly add to whats already been said about this film. Ill simply say that it was, and still is, one of my all time favorite films.I am writing this review urging people to buy the 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray Edition for one reason and one reason only, the soundtrack. This is not to say that the soundtrack is the only worthy upgrade in this version, quite the contrary as I think this version is outstanding in every possible way (unlike the previous releases). Its simply because its worth upgrading to just for the soundtrack alone. Its hands down one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard and until you have heard it in all its glory on Blu_Ray....well your really missing out as this is one of those rare films where the soundtrack takes the film to a completely new level and this Blu-Ray version is so superior to the previous releases that its really like hearing it again for the very first time.I have been a HUGE fan of this score since I first heard it. In fact, its pretty much the only thing I listen to when I go storm chasing every year. I just play it again and again and again and again and I have been doing this since I first started chasing over 10 years ago. I just never get sick of it and its really become one of the staples to my entire trip. The people I chase with actually make jokes over the radio. Statements like ""Oh no, he is playing it again"" followed by laughter are extremely common.Anyways this release certainly doesn't disappoint in this regard. The 7.1 DTS-HD master, running roughly over 4600kbs, is absolutely breathtaking. Actually breathtaking doesn't even properly describe just how stunning it is. Its really futile even trying to put it into words. I purchased a new audio system from ADA last year and I have never heard my set-up sound this good. I literally sat in awe for the first 30 minutes of the film. It really must be heard to be believed.Bottom line - There are a lot of reasons to buy this Blu-Ray but for me one reason stuck out far above the others, the score. If your a fan of this film and even remotely enjoyed the score then you should be ordering this as soon as humanely possible. If you haven't seen this film and are a fan of quality scores then your missing out on one of the most iconic American scores ever produced and its never sounded better than it does on the 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray edition. Its like your standing right in the middle of the orchestra. This is really what hi-def is all about.5 stars",5,One Reason You Must Buy the Blu-Ray...,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",2011,2797,"['wont', 'bother', 'going', 'details', 'film', 'chance', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'seen', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'have', ""n't"", 'least', 'heard', 'then', 'are', 'already', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'reviews', 'already', 'written', 'go', 'detail', 'film', 'point', 'really', 'dont', 'think', 'can', 'significantly', 'add', 'whats', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'Ill', 'simply', 'say', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'films.I', 'am', 'writing', 'review', 'urging', 'people', 'buy', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-Ray', 'Edition', 'one', 'reason', 'one', 'reason', 'only', 'soundtrack', 'not', 'say', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'worthy', 'upgrade', 'version', 'contrary', 'think', 'version', 'outstanding', 'possible', 'way', 'previous', 'releases', 'simply', 'worth', 'upgrading', 'just', 'soundtrack', 'alone', 'hands', 'down', 'one', 'best', 'soundtracks', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'have', 'heard', 'glory', 'Blu_Ray', '.well', 'really', 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'rare', 'films', 'where', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'completely', 'new', 'level', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'so', 'superior', 'previous', 'releases', 'really', 'hearing', 'again', 'very', 'first', 'time.I', 'have', 'been', 'HUGE', 'fan', 'score', 'first', 'heard', 'fact', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'thing', 'listen', 'when', 'go', 'storm', 'chasing', 'year', 'just', 'play', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'first', 'started', 'chasing', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'never', 'get', 'sick', 'really', 'become', 'one', 'staples', 'entire', 'trip', 'people', 'chase', 'actually', 'make', 'jokes', 'radio', 'Statements', 'Oh', 'playing', 'again', 'followed', 'laughter', 'are', 'extremely', 'release', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'regard', '7.1', 'DTS-HD', 'master', 'running', 'roughly', '4600kbs', 'absolutely', 'breathtaking', 'Actually', 'breathtaking', ""n't"", 'even', 'properly', 'describe', 'just', 'how', 'stunning', 'really', 'futile', 'even', 'trying', 'put', 'words', 'purchased', 'new', 'audio', 'system', 'ADA', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'set-up', 'sound', 'good', 'literally', 'sat', 'awe', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'film', 'really', 'must', 'be', 'heard', 'be', 'believed.Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'lot', 'reasons', 'buy', 'Blu-Ray', 'one', 'reason', 'stuck', 'out', 'far', 'others', 'score', 'fan', 'film', 'even', 'remotely', 'enjoyed', 'score', 'then', 'should', 'be', 'ordering', 'as', 'soon', 'humanely', 'possible', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'quality', 'scores', 'then', 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'American', 'scores', 'ever', 'produced', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-Ray', 'edition', 'standing', 'right', 'middle', 'orchestra', 'really', 'what', 'hi-def', 'about.5', 'stars']",N/A

Apparently the American public, who is accustomed to such trifling immodesty, swallowed this up when it was first released and hailed Costner as the ""new genius of American art films"".Well, since then we've learned two things, that first of all, this film is another foray into the ""John Wayne"" bias of American dogmatism and secondly Costner is a ham who hasn't scored another big hit in years. The film gives us the once again undefiled view of an idealist who was born in the wrong ethic group. Costner plays a Union troop in the Civil War that is merely a ""misunderstood"" progeny and suffers physically and spiritually as a result of it. He gets a new command and like a dim witted simpleton he picks the one that is the furthest from civilization. He soon learns that solitude is not an easy thing. One day he encounters a group of Indians in one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen put forth to a group of adults. The film goes down hill from there and fast. One unrealistic example is when he shows his new Indian friends some ground coffee and they react like dumb founded buffoons, it was a fact in history that the Native Americans ground corn, and other seeds so they would in no way be surprised like this exaggerated claim. Why render them childish?Costner then becomes a part of the tribe, merely walking into it like a new found brother. He learns the dialect, and sits with the chief while exuding pensive thought. Of course, instead of falling in love with an Indian woman, he falls in love with a captured white who mumbles her way through like a drought minded wench. How convenient that the evil Sioux captured an English speaking woman who is both beautiful and robust! Instead of portraying the Indians in a truthful manner, Costner singlehandedly misinterprets their culture as something bordering on vanity and he does so by extinguishing their intelligence and ability to live in harmony with nature.Also, the scenes that dealt with the Pawnee were merely used for action sequences and in no way understood the vital role that other tribes had in relation to each other. The only decent portrait is of the stupidity and narrowness of the virulent white people who were shooting at everyone and everything.

But nothing he did before would have presaged his extraordinary effort as a director in Dances with Wolves, a superior epic western. Based on the novel by Michael Blake - who also wrote the screenplay - Costner stars as Lieutenant John Dunbar, a Civil War veteran who volunteers for a post in a remote part of the West, so he can see it ""before it's gone."" Reaching his destination, Dunbar finds it inexplicably deserted, and so he resolves to hold the fort, literally, until replacements arrive. Soon he is tormented but then befriended by a tribe of Lakota Sioux, who eventually adopt him as one of their own. Among them, he meets the love of his life, a white woman the Sioux have named Stands with a Fist (Mary McDonnell), who also had been adopted by the tribe as a child. The movie is distinguished by having all of its Native American roles played by Native Americans, and Graham Greene (as Kicking Bird), Rodney Grant (as Wind in his Hair) and Floyd Red Crow Westerman (as Chief Ten Bears) are particularly memorable, as is Wes Studi as a menacing member of the Pawnee tribe. Alternately joyous and terrifying, as with so many other great epics it's an ultimately heartbreaking story.

459344,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6305304750,Randy Keehn,"[3, 4]","I was debating an excellent vs. a very good rating for ""Dances With Wolves"".  I settled for excellent because my objections probably pale (no pun intended) in comparison to the accomplished movie Kevin Costner has put together.  It is an epic film that tells the tale of the Plains Indians a few short years before the Battle of the Little Big Horn.  It intends for us to get a sense of the life and times of that era and I felt that objective was stunningly achieved.  Indeed, short of a documentary, this movie does as well in that area as any other movie I've seen.  You might say that Costner was content not to let the plot get in the way of the story.  On that basis alone, this is an excellent movie.My qualms with the movie are two-fold and, unfortunately, they have to do with racial matters.  First, the White people in ""Dances With Wolves"" generally come across as stupid, bigoted jerks.  I am more than ready to concede that this was probably true of a lot of people Costner meant to portray.  However, starting with the officer who assigned Costner to his post, I think the characterization is way over-done at times.  A better director could get the point across without having some officer wet his pants.  More profound to me was my second objection about ""Dances with Wolves"".  I was bothered that the solitary male that Costner portrayed could only develop a relationship with another of his own race.  Was Costner afraid to take that step or did it not occur to him that he might have just as easily fallen for a Sioux maiden as a White woman captured years before?  I saw this movie in the theater with my wife, a Native American, and, while times are certainly different now than then, it struck us both that the director was reaching a bit too far.  Probably a minor point to many but I still wrangle over it.""Dances with Wolves"" was a big hit and justifiably so.  If you haven't seen it, set aside several hours on a quiet evening to enjoy it.  It starts out rather odd but it won't be long before you begin to see what made it an excellent movie.",5,My Life on the Plains,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,2069,"['was', 'debating', 'excellent', 'vs.', 'very', 'good', 'rating', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'settled', 'excellent', 'objections', 'probably', 'pale', 'pun', 'intended', 'comparison', 'accomplished', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'put', 'together', 'epic', 'film', 'tale', 'Plains', 'Indians', 'few', 'short', 'years', 'Battle', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'get', 'sense', 'life', 'times', 'era', 'felt', 'objective', 'was', 'stunningly', 'achieved', 'Indeed', 'short', 'documentary', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'area', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'might', 'say', 'Costner', 'was', 'content', 'not', 'let', 'plot', 'get', 'way', 'story', 'basis', 'alone', 'excellent', 'movie.My', 'qualms', 'movie', 'are', 'two-fold', 'unfortunately', 'have', 'do', 'racial', 'matters', 'First', 'White', 'people', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'generally', 'come', 'stupid', 'bigoted', 'jerks', 'am', 'more', 'ready', 'concede', 'was', 'probably', 'true', 'lot', 'people', 'Costner', 'meant', 'portray', 'However', 'starting', 'officer', 'who', 'assigned', 'Costner', 'post', 'think', 'characterization', 'way', 'over-done', 'times', 'better', 'director', 'could', 'get', 'point', 'having', 'officer', 'wet', 'pants', 'More', 'profound', 'was', 'second', 'objection', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'was', 'bothered', 'solitary', 'male', 'Costner', 'portrayed', 'could', 'only', 'develop', 'relationship', 'own', 'race', 'Was', 'Costner', 'afraid', 'take', 'step', 'did', 'not', 'occur', 'might', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'fallen', 'Sioux', 'maiden', 'White', 'woman', 'captured', 'years', 'saw', 'movie', 'theater', 'wife', 'Native', 'American', 'times', 'are', 'certainly', 'different', 'now', 'then', 'struck', 'director', 'was', 'reaching', 'bit', 'too', 'far', 'Probably', 'minor', 'point', 'many', 'still', 'wrangle', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'was', 'big', 'hit', 'justifiably', 'so', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'set', 'aside', 'several', 'hours', 'quiet', 'evening', 'enjoy', 'out', 'rather', 'odd', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'long', 'begin', 'see', 'what', 'made', 'excellent', 'movie']",N/A

Crawford,"[0, 0]","With the possible exception of Little Big Man, this film brings to life the uniqueness of an indian culture - the Sioux - with a sensitivity and intelligence that is without equal.  Not only that, but the film aged extremely well and did not in the slightest feel outdated.  Given the quirkiness of the Kostner character, who is not by any means some kind of noble hero, and absolutely first-rate acting, and you have a masterpiece.The films starts during the Civil War, when an injured Kostner makes a gesture of despair and hope, to gain access to the officers' surgeon to save his wounded leg.  Offered whatever assignment he desires, he chooses the frontier, to witness it before it disappears.  So starts a journey in which he joins a Sioux tribe  and achieves the status of warrior.  It is a success that I have not found in any other cinematic experience - utterly convincing, painfully intimate, full of mistakes, and ultimately sad.  It is a spiritual journey to find his true identity and completely believable, even with the ambiguity of the ending.  I believe it is Kostner's best work.As he gets to know the tribe, the individual personalities emerge with wonderful clarity, but it is the portrait of the tribe as a whole, the culture, that was by far the most beautiful for me.  There is grace, love, camaraderie, the sacred, and brutality all rolled into one.  Little Big Man did the same for the Cheyenne, but there was always an element of parody and tall tale to the film that I felt was aimed at children.  This film is adult, with realistically awful violence next to the beauty.  Indeed, it has inspired me to research Sioux culture more deeply.My only criticisms include how crude the white interlopers appear.  It makes you cheer when they are killed, though there is a good captain.  Also, when becoming part of the tribe, Kostner supplies them with guns to fight another tribe, which I think is a profound violation of his duty as an army officer.  Finally, the bit with the wolf is stretched to the point of the truly maudlin.Warmly recommended.  My wife and I had seen this shortly after she moved with me to the US, so it was an introduction to American history for her, a European.

459364,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6305304750,Robert Morris,"[5, 7]","I recently saw Open Range which shares much in common with this film. Both have an unhurried pace, often dwell on what seem to be insignificant details (but which prove significant later), and both make effective use of the setting in which most of the action occurs. This is Kevin Costner's style as director, one which is especially effective in this film. It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and received seven, including those for best film, director (Costner), cinematography (Dean Semler), adapted screenplay, editing, and sound. There are two essential conflicts in the plot, one which is cultural and another which involves the Lakota Sioux and their hated enemies, the Pawnee. The former was the inevitable result of westward expansion which eventually eliminated most of the Native Americans who opposed it; the latter existed long before that expansion accelerated following the Civil War. This film has a peculiar beginning: Lieutenant John Dunbar (Costner) seems determined to commit suicide as his Union associates face Confederate troops. During a lull, he races his horse across the field which divides them and is seriously wounded. His behavior is viewed as heroism because it inspires what becomes a victory for the Union troops. Later, after he recovers, he requests assignment to a military outpost in South Dakota. The clear implication is that he wants to get as far away as he can from ""civilization."" Upon arrival, he find the outpost abandoned. The supplies are unloaded and then he is alone, except for his horse and a curious but cautious wolf which observes him from a distance. Through a series of events, he later becomes involved with a Lakota Sioux tribe and a personal transition then begins which....It would be a disservice to those who have not as yet seen this film to say any more about the plot. Suffice to say that there is a great deal of sometimes violent action which Costner (as director) brilliantly juxtaposes with moments of exquisite tenderness and deep reflection. All of the performances are outstanding. One of the strongest is provided by Mary McDonnell (Stands with a Fist), a white woman and recent widow who has lived most of her life among the Lakota. I especially enjoyed Wes Studi's work in this film as the Toughest Pawnee, (as well as in The Last of the Mohicans as Magua) and Graham Greene's performance as Kicking Bird, Stands with a Fist's surrogate father. Some of the most effective photography recreates a buffalo hunt during which Dunbar helps his friends and neighbors to obtain the food and hides they need before the arrival of winter. There is also an especially well-staged attack on the Lakota camp by the Pawnee in which Dunbar also plays a key role. The ""civilization"" he rejected eventually follows him westward, forcing him to make a predictable choice. Dunbar's assimilation reminds me of one experienced by John Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) in Shogun following his immersion in 17th century Japanese culture. By the time a choice had to be made, neither hesitated and each made his decision for reasons which reveal so much about the new values to which each is committed. Some have criticized this film for being so obviously sympathetic with the Lakota and so critical of the society from which Dunbar fled. They have a point. It is important to remember, however, that Costner is telling the story from a specific point-of-view. He selected historical material which gives his film a degree of authenticity, to be sure, but whose greater purpose is to expedite as well as enrich the narrative. He, his cast, and crew should be very proud of what they achieved together: a thoroughly entertaining film of a very high quality.Be sure to purchase the Special Edition DVD which offers so many supplementary items which include commentaries by Kevin Costner, producer Jim Wilson, director of photography Dean Semler and editor Neil Travis, a new extended version with never-before-seen additional scenes (236 minutes), and a new ""The Creation of an Epic"" retrospective documentary.",5,Probably Costner's Greatest Achievement Thus Far,1063670400,"09 16, 2003",2003,4067,"['recently', 'saw', 'Open', 'Range', 'shares', 'much', 'common', 'film', 'have', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'often', 'dwell', 'what', 'seem', 'be', 'insignificant', 'details', 'prove', 'significant', 'later', 'make', 'effective', 'use', 'setting', 'most', 'action', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'style', 'director', 'one', 'especially', 'effective', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', '12', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'received', 'seven', 'including', 'best', 'film', 'director', 'Costner', 'cinematography', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'adapted', 'screenplay', 'editing', 'sound', 'are', 'two', 'essential', 'conflicts', 'plot', 'one', 'cultural', 'Lakota', 'Sioux', 'hated', 'enemies', 'Pawnee', 'former', 'was', 'inevitable', 'result', 'westward', 'expansion', 'eventually', 'eliminated', 'most', 'Native', 'Americans', 'who', 'opposed', 'latter', 'existed', 'long', 'expansion', 'accelerated', 'following', 'Civil', 'War', 'film', 'peculiar', 'beginning', 'Lieutenant', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Costner', 'determined', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Union', 'face', 'Confederate', 'troops', 'lull', 'horse', 'field', 'seriously', 'wounded', 'behavior', 'viewed', 'heroism', 'what', 'victory', 'Union', 'troops', 'Later', 'assignment', 'military', 'outpost', 'South', 'Dakota', 'clear', 'implication', 'get', 'far', 'away', 'can', 'civilization', 'arrival', 'find', 'outpost', 'abandoned', 'supplies', 'are', 'unloaded', 'then', 'alone', 'horse', 'curious', 'cautious', 'wolf', 'distance', 'series', 'events', 'later', 'involved', 'Lakota', 'Sioux', 'tribe', 'personal', 'transition', 'then', '.It', 'would', 'be', 'disservice', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'say', 'more', 'plot', 'Suffice', 'say', 'great', 'deal', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'action', 'Costner', 'director', 'brilliantly', 'moments', 'exquisite', 'tenderness', 'deep', 'reflection', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'One', 'strongest', 'provided', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Fist', 'white', 'woman', 'recent', 'widow', 'who', 'lived', 'most', 'life', 'Lakota', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'Wes', 'Studi', 'work', 'film', 'Toughest', 'Pawnee', 'as', 'well', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'Magua', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'performance', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'Fist', 'surrogate', 'father', 'most', 'effective', 'photography', 'buffalo', 'hunt', 'Dunbar', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'obtain', 'food', 'hides', 'need', 'arrival', 'winter', 'also', 'especially', 'well-staged', 'attack', 'Lakota', 'camp', 'Pawnee', 'Dunbar', 'also', 'key', 'role', 'civilization', 'rejected', 'eventually', 'westward', 'forcing', 'make', 'predictable', 'choice', 'Dunbar', 'assimilation', 'one', 'experienced', 'John', 'Blackthorne', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Shogun', 'following', 'immersion', '17th', 'century', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'time', 'choice', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'hesitated', 'made', 'decision', 'reasons', 'reveal', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'values', 'committed', 'have', 'criticized', 'film', 'being', 'so', 'obviously', 'sympathetic', 'Lakota', 'so', 'critical', 'society', 'Dunbar', 'fled', 'have', 'point', 'important', 'remember', 'however', 'Costner', 'telling', 'story', 'specific', 'point-of-view', 'selected', 'historical', 'material', 'film', 'degree', 'authenticity', 'be', 'sure', 'greater', 'purpose', 'expedite', 'as', 'well', 'enrich', 'narrative', 'cast', 'crew', 'should', 'be', 'very', 'proud', 'what', 'achieved', 'together', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'film', 'very', 'high', 'quality.Be', 'sure', 'purchase', 'Special', 'Edition', 'DVD', 'so', 'many', 'supplementary', 'items', 'include', 'commentaries', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'producer', 'Jim', 'Wilson', 'director', 'photography', 'Dean', 'Semler', 'editor', 'Neil', 'Travis', 'new', 'extended', 'version', 'never-before-seen', 'additional', 'scenes', '236', 'minutes', 'new', 'Creation', 'Epic', 'retrospective', 'documentary']",N/A

459367,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6305304750,Roger J. Buffington,"[0, 0]","This film is the best ""Western"" film in decades. Kevin Costner turns in a fine performance as a Civil War cavalry hero who is posted to the Western Frontier, and by accident is assigned to an abandoned outpost by a deranged commander. Alone and isolated from the Army, Costner eventually becomes first acquainted with, then absorbed by, the local Lakota Sioux tribe. Although the storyline sounds simple, this is in fact a complex story with many dimensions.The film's greatest success is its portrayal of the Sioux as ordinary human beings in a highly complex and civilized society, albeit one very unlike our own. The Sioux are shown to be a brave, compassionate, friendly people, although possessed of a warlike tradition and culture.The cinematography of the film is superb, and it wonderfully captures the size and grandeur of the American west. The picture is crisp and the scenes are vivid. There are no phony looking sets of the type that often plagues Western films. As if this were not enough, this film contains one of the best musical scores I've ever heard. ""Looks Like a Suicide,"" the main musical score of the film, is wonderful.Unfortunately, this film has two very serious flaws that caused me to deprive it of a ""five stars"" rating. It is far, far too long. I like the film enough so that I admit that I enjoy the length, but there is no doubt in my mind at least that this film could and should have been shorter--this would not have decreased its impact.The second flaw is that, as the Amazon editorial review says, the scene when the American soldiers return is simply overdone. It is OK to villainize them; history suggests that this is at not undeserved. But it could have been done in a less extreme fashion--the way it was done caused the whole scene to seem one dimensional, and not particularly enjoyable, at least to me.The Special Edition DVD is the one to get. The ""deleted scenes"" that it includes are some of the better ones; I would say that this suggests that the one big flaw in this film is the editing--the regular version excluded some good scenes and included some scenes that seem to simply constitute filler. Well, opinions may differ. The audio commentaries are interesting, although I admit I have not yet listened to them all and may never do so.All in all, there is a tremendous amount to like in this film, and most film afficianados will enjoy this DVD thoroughly.

It is beautifully directed; the cinematography, the costumes, the story, the characters, the acting all come together and create an unforgettable drama from history. It is one of those movies that really brings a new, fresh perspective to history.I am from a foreign country and I grew up watching American Western movies when I was a kid. In those movies, I remember white guys were always the good guys and Indians were the savages. I always thought there was something wrong with that picture. It seemed to me just too one-sided. For some strange reason, I've always found myself associating myself with the Indians more than the cowboys. Even though they were depicted as savages with primitive, tribal culture, I found something beautiful about that. I always thought using arrows, and axes or just bare hands required more skill and courage. And I never understood why they would be bad if it was their land in the first place. And even though I didn't know much about the US history, I have always thought there would have had to be more to Indians.Dances with Wolves is a special movie. I believe it is the first movie that gives an insight to the lives of Indians and doesn't depict them as mere savages. It shows the humanistic side of Indians, how they are family oriented, they have high values, like honor and friendship and loyalty. They are not just monsters as older Western movies would have us believe. Dances with Wolves tells the story of John Dunbar who is holding a post at the frontier and befriends Sioux Indians from a near-by village. The movie successfully shows how human beings, no matter how different they seem to be on the outside, they can communicate with each other and form beautiful friendship. This movie accomplishes this, if not anything else. This lesson can be applied to any situation in the world even today where people from different countries, races or religion try to live in peace.This Blu ray version is only the extended version (4 hours) so you will not have the choice of watching the original theatrical release which is 3 hours. This may be the only downside of this release. Other than this, Blu ray transfer is fantastic. Audio is 7.1 HD DTS which is not very common (most movies are only 5.1). It has bunch of extras and feature commentaries (see the product details page). If you love this movie, you will definitely enjoy the Blu ray picture and sound quailty.

Most movies about Native Americans provide only the vision through the lens of the white man.  Somehow, this felt different.  By the time that the story had developed the relationship of a soldier with the Sioux, his acceptance of the Sioux way of life was predestined.  One feels sad that we destroyed the Indian way of life, that we felt that it was somehow inferior.This is quite an accomplishment for a movie.  This is how a movie makes the transition from entertainment into art.  It tells us something about ourselves that we didn't know.

459391,A1FNES0QEBJZD1,6305304750,Steve Douglas,"[6, 6]","Odd that the theatrical version I have does have DTS audio but the extended version I bought after does not.  The extended version is a must whether on blu ray or not as it fills in the many gaps in the plot line that were left unexplored in the original release.  Never the less, the real reason I am taking the opportunity to write this is:1) Reviews of Standard Definition and Blu Ray releases should most definitely be separated by Amazon.2) For those readers and writers of any movie reviews, I do not understand why the majority feel the need to summarize the story.  Most everyone knows the story already; this is not time for a book report.  The reviews that are helpful are the ones that spend time discussing the quality of both the video and audio. Blu ray in itself does not necessarily provide better quality.  For those who take the time to provide audio and video quality info, I thank you.3) I wonder if the powers that be at Amazon actually read any of the reviews.  If they know a release is not a proper remaster or if a new and improved version comes out, why do they continue to sell older/poorer releases.  For example, the 35 years, 35 films collection of Clint Eastwood films had to be the worst, most poorly designed and produced collection ever.  And yet they still sell it.  Don't they have a fiduciary responsibility to their customers to steer them away from such trash production towards those that are of quality?12/20/2012Well, I just watched the 20th Anniversary Edition on Blu Ray.  Only the extended version is included which is fine by me making the film almost a 4 hour sitting.  The video is artifact free with no obvious grain or aliasing.  However, the imaging tends to be soft though there is good detail in the shadows and darker scenes and a warm color resolution.  Overall,  I do not think this Blu Ray transfer provides that much of an improvement over previous standard def releases.The Audio is DTS HD 7.1 and the front sound stage is nicely spread with audio levels well done.  Some panning in the fronts but, as this is narrator directed, you will find that there is a severe lacking of channeling to the rears and almost no discreet channeling either which makes me wonder why they went to 7.1 rather than 5.1.  Your sub gets a decent workout in some parts such as the buffalo stampede but this scene also points out the lack of proper use of channeling to the rears such as when the buffalo comes to the camera and runs past over and past it.  There should be just as much noise and rumble to the rears then as there were in the front channels.  It appears that more work went into the music score than it did in creating any foley fx.As this is now my 3rd, and hopefully last, purchase of Dancing with Wolves, I must admit that while the Blu Ray is very well done, it was also a disappointment as there was no great improvement over my previous extended version.The extras are plentiful and interesting and should take you several hours to get through them all.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks",5,Dances With Wolfs Extended Edition and Blu Ray,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,3354,"['Odd', 'theatrical', 'version', 'have', 'have', 'DTS', 'audio', 'extended', 'version', 'bought', 'not', 'extended', 'version', 'must', 'blu', 'ray', 'not', 'many', 'gaps', 'plot', 'line', 'were', 'left', 'unexplored', 'original', 'release', 'less', 'real', 'reason', 'am', 'taking', 'opportunity', 'write', 'is:1', 'Reviews', 'Standard', 'Definition', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'should', 'most', 'definitely', 'be', 'separated', 'Amazon.2', 'readers', 'writers', 'movie', 'reviews', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'majority', 'feel', 'need', 'summarize', 'story', 'Most', 'everyone', 'story', 'already', 'not', 'time', 'book', 'report', 'reviews', 'are', 'helpful', 'are', 'ones', 'spend', 'time', 'discussing', 'quality', 'video', 'audio', 'Blu', 'ray', 'not', 'necessarily', 'provide', 'better', 'quality', 'who', 'take', 'time', 'provide', 'audio', 'video', 'quality', 'info', 'thank', 'you.3', 'wonder', 'powers', 'be', 'Amazon', 'actually', 'read', 'reviews', 'know', 'release', 'not', 'proper', 'remaster', 'new', 'improved', 'version', 'out', 'why', 'do', 'continue', 'sell', 'older/poorer', 'releases', 'example', '35', 'years', '35', 'films', 'collection', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'films', 'had', 'be', 'worst', 'most', 'poorly', 'designed', 'produced', 'collection', 'ever', 'yet', 'still', 'sell', 'Do', ""n't"", 'have', 'fiduciary', 'responsibility', 'customers', 'steer', 'away', 'such', 'trash', 'production', 'towards', 'are', 'quality', '12/20/2012Well', 'just', 'watched', '20th', 'Anniversary', 'Edition', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'Only', 'extended', 'version', 'included', 'fine', 'making', 'film', 'almost', '4', 'hour', 'sitting', 'video', 'artifact', 'free', 'obvious', 'grain', 'aliasing', 'However', 'imaging', 'tends', 'be', 'soft', 'good', 'detail', 'shadows', 'darker', 'scenes', 'warm', 'color', 'resolution', 'Overall', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'transfer', 'much', 'improvement', 'previous', 'standard', 'def', 'releases.The', 'Audio', 'DTS', 'HD', '7.1', 'front', 'sound', 'stage', 'nicely', 'spread', 'audio', 'levels', 'well', 'done', 'panning', 'fronts', 'narrator', 'directed', 'will', 'find', 'severe', 'lacking', 'channeling', 'rears', 'almost', 'discreet', 'channeling', 'wonder', 'why', 'went', '7.1', 'rather', '5.1', 'sub', 'decent', 'workout', 'parts', 'such', 'buffalo', 'stampede', 'scene', 'also', 'out', 'lack', 'proper', 'use', 'channeling', 'rears', 'such', 'when', 'buffalo', 'camera', 'past', 'should', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'noise', 'rumble', 'rears', 'then', 'were', 'front', 'channels', 'more', 'work', 'went', 'music', 'score', 'did', 'creating', 'foley', 'fx.As', 'now', '3rd', 'hopefully', 'last', 'purchase', 'Dancing', 'Wolves', 'must', 'admit', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'also', 'disappointment', 'was', 'great', 'improvement', 'previous', 'extended', 'version.The', 'extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'interesting', 'should', 'take', 'several', 'hours', 'get', 'all.All', 'movie', 'reviews', 'are', 'nature', 'focus', 'only', 'quality', 'transfer', 'BluRay', 'so', 'check', 'see', 'are', 'help', 'well.Hopefully', 'review', 'been', 'help', 'determining', 'purchase', 'hope', 'am', 'correct', 'path', 'review', 'transfer', 'quality', 'opposed', 'providing', 'plot', 'summaries.Thanks']",N/A

Nobody ever said these people are not brilliant. There is no real lie in &quot;Dances&quot; that I can see, but it does seem stylized. The Indians are pictured as peaceful, spiritual conservers of the land. Real-life Indians had every potential of being violent savages without anybody's prompting. Just ask the Mexicans who were systematically robbed by them every harvest until American mountain men with guns were recruited to provide a little security. The soldiers are dumbellionites, as are most of the whites that Kevin Costner &quot;escapes&quot; from in his effort to find the real West.

He becomes friends with the local Indians and eventually becomes one of them. He meets and marries a white woman called ""Stand with fist"" whose family was killed by another tribe. She wonders into their tribe and is adopted by the Village chief. Stand with fist becomes a translator between Dunbar and the Native Indians (eventhough she has not spoken these words (English) since she was two).John Dunbar begins a transformation were he begins to see these native indians not as savages but as fellow human beings. One day the native people see him Dancing with wolves around a campfire. They then give him his tribal name ""Dances with wolves"". Overtime Lt. Dunbar becomes completely assimilated into their culture.Granham Green gives an outstanding performance as the chief. Graham Greenbecomes the first Native American to be nominated for an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor). Granham also gives a fine performance as Ishi in the movie ""Last of his tribe"".One reviewer wrote that this movie tends to romanticize the Indians by portaying them as saintly people. I have had courses in American Indian Studies and I have to confess that it is true. Native Americans have been romanticized in our popular culture. Dances with wolves portray the Indians as good guys and white people as bad guys. This portrayal tends to be one sided. Not all white people were bad. Many wanted to help the Indians. But, because of their short sightedness and lack of understanding of Native American culture, many of their programs ended up hurting the native people. While many movies portray Native Americans are portrayed as Savages, Many Native Americans are also falsley portrayed as great evironmentalists. In fact Native Americans were just as exploitive of their resources as white people. They just didn't create an impact because their numbers were small and their population size was controlled by the carrying capacity of the environment. Many Native American tribes were aggressive and did kill white people with out provocation. Dances with wolves does tend to be one sided and is just as false as any other western that portray Indians as blood thirsty savages.The story telling was very good and the cinematography was fantasic. The movie really showed the beauty of the western frontier.

Mcclure ""tcchapin""","[2, 3]","&#34;Dances With Wolves&#34; is touching and well made, but at times it seems as if it's trying just a little too hard to exist. It has makings of a classic: full of drama and passion, understanding and communication, and violence and power, but perhaps they are emphasized a little too much.Kevin Costner directed, produced, and stars in this epic tale about John Dunbar, a Union lieutenant during the Civil War, who heads west to mark a post for pioneers and soldiers. He encounters some Sioux Indians who are portrayed rather savagely at first. We fear them and almost hate them as much as Dunbar. Can they make peace?Much of the story revolves around the Indian tribe as we learn they are just as afraid of the white man as he is of them. Dunbar makes his first real gesture for peace when he encounters an injured Indian woman and gives her medical attention. When he brings her back to her tribe, they are not thankful, instead they scare him away. Eventually, the two sides work together and communicate. Both Dunbar and Sioux wonder where all the Buffalo have gone, and this gives them their first conflict to solve together.Little happens in terms of plot and individual events. There isn't much dialogue because the two people cannot speak the same language. However, the body language and other forms of symbolic communication they use makes the story interesting. The characters show their emotions through their actions, they work together, hunt together and at least try to communicate with one another.But a film cannot depend on indirect communication, so a translator (and a lover) is provided. Mary McDonnell co-stars as Stands With A Fist, a white woman who has lived with the Sioux since she was a child. It is obvious she and Dunbar will fall in love, but it does not seem as cliche it sounds. Because we are experiencing a new culture here, the concept of love is different from what we are used to. This originality and sense of character is what makes the film so great and touching. At first we feared the Sioux, now they are our friends and our family.I didn't like the third act that much, but it's the entire point of the film. When Dunbar goes back to his cabin he is no longer John Dunbar, he is Dances With Wolves, and when the newly arrived Northern Army sees him, they mistake him for an Indian. These are the people we and Dunbar started out with, and now we see them in a completely different manner. The story almost becomes an adventure as we hope Dunbar will escape. It's exciting to watch, but it does seem a bit much.Despite a few flaws, &#34;Dances With Wolves&#34; is excellent for what it is. But it does have a vivid theme about maturity, tolerance, and war and peace.",5,One of the Best Movies of all Time!,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,2712,"['34', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '34', 'touching', 'well', 'made', 'times', 'trying', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'exist', 'makings', 'classic', 'full', 'drama', 'passion', 'understanding', 'communication', 'violence', 'power', 'perhaps', 'are', 'emphasized', 'little', 'too', 'much.Kevin', 'Costner', 'directed', 'produced', 'stars', 'epic', 'tale', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Union', 'lieutenant', 'Civil', 'War', 'who', 'west', 'mark', 'post', 'pioneers', 'soldiers', 'Sioux', 'Indians', 'who', 'are', 'portrayed', 'rather', 'savagely', 'first', 'fear', 'almost', 'hate', 'as', 'much', 'Dunbar', 'Can', 'make', 'peace', 'Much', 'story', 'Indian', 'tribe', 'learn', 'are', 'just', 'afraid', 'white', 'man', 'Dunbar', 'first', 'real', 'gesture', 'peace', 'when', 'injured', 'Indian', 'woman', 'medical', 'attention', 'When', 'back', 'tribe', 'are', 'not', 'thankful', 'instead', 'scare', 'away', 'Eventually', 'two', 'sides', 'work', 'together', 'communicate', 'Dunbar', 'Sioux', 'wonder', 'where', 'Buffalo', 'have', 'gone', 'first', 'conflict', 'solve', 'together.Little', 'happens', 'terms', 'plot', 'individual', 'events', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'However', 'body', 'language', 'other', 'forms', 'symbolic', 'communication', 'use', 'story', 'interesting', 'characters', 'show', 'emotions', 'actions', 'work', 'together', 'hunt', 'together', 'least', 'try', 'communicate', 'one', 'another.But', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'depend', 'indirect', 'communication', 'translator', 'lover', 'provided', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'co-stars', 'Stands', 'Fist', 'white', 'woman', 'who', 'lived', 'Sioux', 'was', 'child', 'obvious', 'Dunbar', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'not', 'seem', 'cliche', 'are', 'experiencing', 'new', 'culture', 'here', 'concept', 'love', 'different', 'what', 'are', 'used', 'originality', 'sense', 'character', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'great', 'touching', 'first', 'feared', 'Sioux', 'now', 'are', 'friends', 'family.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'third', 'act', 'much', 'entire', 'point', 'film', 'When', 'Dunbar', 'back', 'cabin', 'no', 'longer', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'when', 'newly', 'arrived', 'Northern', 'Army', 'mistake', 'Indian', 'are', 'people', 'Dunbar', 'started', 'out', 'now', 'see', 'completely', 'different', 'manner', 'story', 'almost', 'adventure', 'hope', 'Dunbar', 'will', 'escape', 'exciting', 'watch', 'seem', 'bit', 'much.Despite', 'few', 'flaws', '34', 'Dances', 'Wolves', '34', 'excellent', 'what', 'have', 'vivid', 'theme', 'maturity', 'tolerance', 'war', 'peace']",N/A

I realized what my father's generation must have felt like when they saw Lawrence of Arabia for the first time. The sheer majesty of this film is incredible and it's one that helped brought back the epic motion picture.With the new DVD you get an extra hour of film and all of it is worth watching. There is more character development, shots of vistas that must have bought tears to the eyes when it did not make the first cut, and what really happened the soldiers that abandoned Fort Sedgewick. The picture quality was good and it does not take away from the film, but I agree with other critics when they say they were expecting something a little bit more vibrant coming from the DVD. Especially when MGM has done wonders when rereleasing their eye-popping musicals.The behind the scenes documentary the typically formatted but very good. Fans will enjoy. The feature that the was most unneccessary was the introduction to the photo gallery. The Photos are great, however Ben Glass comes out with his dog and reads from a contrived script, making this feature very schmaltzy.The feature I did enjoy most was the Costner/Wilson commentary. Very informative and worth listening to. Costner bounces between being self absorbed to being very gracious. But they manage to stick to the point as the movie plays. It's obvious that Costner and Wilson love this film. Points also go to them talking about the many names of the that appear on the end credits and where their careers went with as much emphasis as they did with the actors and film crew.

I couldn't agree more.I have a special place in my heart for this movie especially since I have taken a missions trip up to Pine Ridge, SD where the Lakota reservation now exists. It is deplorable, but that's a whole other subject. Back to the movie...Despite the fact that the movie is over 3 hours long, it never really drags because the story is so good. Costner's character, John Dunbar, is determined not to lose his leg, which was badly wounded in battle. It is an excruciating scene when he has to slip his leg back into his boot! John Dunbar wishes to see the frontier before it is gone and his request is granted. The journey that begins there changes him in a postive way when he befriends the Sioux (Lakota) Indians, finds a sort of companion in a lone wolf (which he names ""Two Socks""), and falls in love with ""Stands With A Fist"", played by the wonderful Mary McDonnell.The experiences John Dunbar has with the Indians teaches him that not all the natives are hostile and savage. That they are a simple people who live off the land, waste nothing and only desire to be left alone to live in peace on the land they inherited from their ancestors. He particularly grows fond of ""Kicking Bird"" played by Graham Greene.There is plenty of excitement between the Buffalo (ttonka) Hunt, the fight with the Pawnee and the clash between the Cavalry Soldiers and the Sioux. The scenery is sometimes breathtaking and at least for me, makes me long for a more simple landscape than the one I see when I drive to work everyday. Truly, our country should always preserve whatever huge chunks of land can be preserved for future generations to be able to observe, walk, ride and breathe-in the wonder of God's creation.Add to the mix a sweeping and inspirational score by John Barry (his magnum opus IMHO) and you have one solid, beautiful film.",5,One of the greatest films of all time...,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,1987,"['Dances', 'Wolves', 'not', 'only', 'highest', 'grossing', 'western', 'time', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'more.I', 'have', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'movie', 'especially', 'have', 'taken', 'missions', 'trip', 'up', 'Pine', 'Ridge', 'SD', 'where', 'Lakota', 'reservation', 'now', 'deplorable', 'whole', 'other', 'subject', 'Back', 'movie', 'fact', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'never', 'really', 'drags', 'story', 'so', 'good', 'Costner', 'character', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'determined', 'not', 'lose', 'leg', 'was', 'badly', 'wounded', 'battle', 'excruciating', 'scene', 'when', 'slip', 'leg', 'back', 'boot', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'see', 'frontier', 'gone', 'request', 'granted', 'journey', 'postive', 'way', 'when', 'Sioux', 'Lakota', 'Indians', 'sort', 'companion', 'lone', 'wolf', 'Two', 'Socks', 'love', 'Stands', 'Fist', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Mary', 'McDonnell.The', 'experiences', 'John', 'Dunbar', 'Indians', 'not', 'natives', 'are', 'hostile', 'savage', 'are', 'simple', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'land', 'waste', 'nothing', 'only', 'desire', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'live', 'peace', 'land', 'inherited', 'ancestors', 'particularly', 'fond', 'Kicking', 'Bird', 'played', 'Graham', 'Greene.There', 'plenty', 'excitement', 'Buffalo', 'ttonka', 'Hunt', 'fight', 'Pawnee', 'clash', 'Cavalry', 'Soldiers', 'Sioux', 'scenery', 'sometimes', 'breathtaking', 'least', 'long', 'more', 'simple', 'landscape', 'one', 'see', 'when', 'drive', 'work', 'everyday', 'Truly', 'country', 'should', 'always', 'preserve', 'huge', 'chunks', 'land', 'can', 'be', 'preserved', 'future', 'generations', 'be', 'able', 'observe', 'walk', 'ride', 'breathe-in', 'wonder', 'God', 'creation.Add', 'mix', 'sweeping', 'inspirational', 'score', 'John', 'Barry', 'magnum', 'IMHO', 'have', 'one', 'solid', 'beautiful', 'film']",N/A

459429,ARFCORBCTKX1J,6305304750,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[6, 8]","Academy members love spectacle and sentiment. ""Dances With Wolves"" delivered them masterfully; it's no wonder it won Best Picture.Though ""Dances With Wolves"" moves at an occasionally measured pace, the relatively slow unfolding of the story and the characters' relationships works to draw the viewer in. The only bad thing is Kevin Costner's (mostly) miserable performance, which, amazingly, /doesn't/ pull down the film with it. But he simply can't act. His delivery is generally weak, flaccid, and unfocused -- and that's when he's working with other actors. When reading text (such as Dunbar's diary), he's even worse -- as clumsy as a teenager in a high-school play. If Costner were as poor a singer as he is an actor, he'd be lucky to be working in a sleazy lounge -- forget the Met.Watching this film for the third or fourth time, I wondered what the point was. Although the author of the novel (and screenplay) apparently wanted to tell an honest story about America's aboriginal people, he probably felt it would have been too difficult to present it from the native peoples' point of view (how does one properly grasp an alien culture?), and that a sympathetic white character would work as an intermediary. It does, but as the character is a good-hearted ""mensch"", the effect is one of begging forgiveness for the atrocities committed against America's native peoples. *The Blu-ray transfer is of the 4-hour extended cut, which I and most viewers find superior to the 3-hour theatrical cut. It's not at all ""bloated"" -- but if you don't want to watch all of it at once, a good point to pause is at the end of the buffalo hunt. The extended cut has an important sequence -- Dunbar's seeing the Lakota's celebration of the killing of white people. His conflicted feelings and recognition that he will never really ""be"" one of these people neutralizes some of the film's ""back to the earth"" sentimentality. (This is a secondary theme -- it's better to live a simple life in which personal relationships dominate, rather than one that's technology-driven.)The Blu-ray appears to be an excellent transfer, without grain reduction or edge sharpening. (It's hard to judge, because even an indifferent Blu-ray is superior to a projected print.) Colors are believably subtle and subdued, except for blood, which looks overly red. John Barry's excellent score -- which thankfully avoids both Copland and Bernstein clich&eacute;s -- gets a solid 7.1 transfer.On a side note... 20 years ago, the wolf coming to Dunbar's camp seemed a bit too Disney-ish sentimental. Now that some biologists believe wolves domesticated humans (not the other way around), it appears positively prescient.The supplemental material is excellent, but slightly less lavish than some other films'. The SD material from previous editions has been carried over, but... it wasn't correctly deinterlaced, and every time something moves more than a little bit, the image breaks up into multi-frame scanning lines. That's unforgivable.PS: I've somewhat changed my opinion about Costner's ""acting"". It appears he's trying to make Dunbar look ingenuous, and open to other ways of life. That's good, but the character is 100% that way from the beginning. It would have been more interesting if his ""I want to see the frontier before it disappears"" carried an imperialist edge -- as if the frontier were his property, which he wanted to examine before it was taken away.* In an interview, the author says that the whites refused to do what the Indians did -- that is, they exploited the environment, rather than living in some degree of harmony with it. The Indians were doomed from the start -- the whites could out-reproduce them. The fundamental difference in economic systems was the basic source of conflict, and no amount of good will could have overcome it.",5,"""Please forgive us white people...""",1297555200,"02 13, 2011",2011,3829,"['Academy', 'members', 'love', 'spectacle', 'sentiment', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'delivered', 'masterfully', 'wonder', 'won', 'Best', 'Picture.Though', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'moves', 'occasionally', 'measured', 'pace', 'relatively', 'slow', 'unfolding', 'story', 'characters', 'relationships', 'draw', 'viewer', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'mostly', 'miserable', 'performance', 'amazingly', ""/doesn't/"", 'pull', 'down', 'film', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'delivery', 'generally', 'weak', 'flaccid', 'unfocused', 'when', 'working', 'other', 'actors', 'When', 'reading', 'text', 'such', 'Dunbar', 'diary', 'even', 'worse', 'as', 'clumsy', 'teenager', 'high-school', 'play', 'Costner', 'were', 'poor', 'singer', 'actor', ""'d"", 'be', 'lucky', 'be', 'working', 'sleazy', 'lounge', 'forget', 'Met.Watching', 'film', 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'wondered', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'author', 'novel', 'screenplay', 'apparently', 'wanted', 'tell', 'honest', 'story', 'America', 'aboriginal', 'people', 'probably', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'difficult', 'present', 'native', 'peoples', 'point', 'view', 'how', 'one', 'properly', 'grasp', 'alien', 'culture', 'sympathetic', 'white', 'character', 'would', 'work', 'intermediary', 'character', 'good-hearted', 'mensch', 'effect', 'one', 'begging', 'forgiveness', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'America', 'native', 'peoples', '*The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', '4-hour', 'extended', 'cut', 'most', 'viewers', 'find', 'superior', '3-hour', 'theatrical', 'cut', 'not', 'bloated', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'once', 'good', 'point', 'pause', 'end', 'buffalo', 'hunt', 'extended', 'cut', 'important', 'sequence', 'Dunbar', 'seeing', 'Lakota', 'celebration', 'killing', 'white', 'people', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'recognition', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'one', 'people', 'neutralizes', 'film', 'back', 'earth', 'sentimentality', 'secondary', 'theme', 'better', 'live', 'simple', 'life', 'personal', 'relationships', 'dominate', 'rather', 'one', 'technology-driven', 'Blu-ray', 'be', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'grain', 'reduction', 'edge', 'sharpening', 'hard', 'judge', 'even', 'indifferent', 'Blu-ray', 'superior', 'projected', 'print', 'Colors', 'are', 'believably', 'subtle', 'subdued', 'blood', 'overly', 'red', 'John', 'Barry', 'excellent', 'score', 'thankfully', 'Copland', 'Bernstein', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'solid', '7.1', 'transfer.On', 'side', 'note', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'wolf', 'coming', 'Dunbar', 'camp', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'Disney-ish', 'sentimental', 'Now', 'biologists', 'believe', 'wolves', 'domesticated', 'humans', 'not', 'other', 'way', 'positively', 'prescient.The', 'supplemental', 'material', 'excellent', 'slightly', 'less', 'lavish', 'other', 'films', 'SD', 'material', 'previous', 'editions', 'been', 'carried', 'was', ""n't"", 'correctly', 'deinterlaced', 'time', 'something', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'image', 'up', 'multi-frame', 'scanning', 'lines', 'unforgivable.PS', ""'ve"", 'somewhat', 'changed', 'opinion', 'Costner', 'acting', 'trying', 'make', 'Dunbar', 'look', 'ingenuous', 'open', 'other', 'ways', 'life', 'good', 'character', '100', '%', 'way', 'beginning', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'want', 'see', 'frontier', 'carried', 'imperialist', 'edge', 'frontier', 'were', 'property', 'wanted', 'examine', 'was', 'taken', 'away', '*', 'interview', 'author', 'whites', 'refused', 'do', 'what', 'Indians', 'did', 'exploited', 'environment', 'rather', 'living', 'degree', 'harmony', 'Indians', 'were', 'doomed', 'start', 'whites', 'could', 'out-reproduce', 'fundamental', 'difference', 'economic', 'systems', 'was', 'basic', 'source', 'conflict', 'amount', 'good', 'will', 'could', 'have', 'overcome']",N/A

I have seen many &#34;academy award&#34; winning movies and had been disappointed by most of them. However, Dances with Wolves was a pleasant surprise that left me feeling satisfied with the experience.So what makes this movie so interesting? Well, let's just get the bad stuff out of the way first. This movie is a very slow burn and I'm pretty sure I fell asleep for about 7-10 minutes or so, mainly when he's on his way to the new fort. Thankfully this wasn't integral to the plot, so having dozed off for a little bit didn't ruin the experience.You have to watch this movie when you have free time and no distractions. The 3 hours is a daunting challenge, but trust me, it's well worth it. (Even if you take a nap at the beginning.)On to the good!Unlike most movies as of late. There's no 2-5 minute shot where you're just sitting there watching nothing. Something is always happening and all the characters have agency. Whether it's as simple as wanting to die, going to see the frontier, or trading goods, each character wants and tries to get something.Standard scene stuff right? Wrong.You see, you don't realize it earlier on, but the movie is secretly manipulating you with these little gestures. You see Kevin Costner's character Lt. Dunbar meet the native Americans for the first time and wonder how the heck are these guys going to communicate?They don't, they don't for a long time. He mimes animals to try to translate and the natives try to understand him as well. It is through this innocent exchange of learning to communicate and sharing in a cup of coffee that you start to... like these people. The film very gently tugs on your heart strings and let's you grow to enjoy the characters. You develop an appreciate for the Sioux culture which is all about family, survival, and taking pleasure in the simple things in life.You star to understand how Dunbar feels, because he is played in such a neutral fashion, that you can easily see yourself as a visitor to the Sioux village.

459436,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6305304750,Wuchak,"[2, 3]","I haven't seen ""Dances With Wolves"" for years but recently rediscovered its brilliance. Released in 1990, the story involves Lt. Dunbar (Kevin Costner), a Civil War hero, singlehandedly manning a desolate prairie post in South Dakota. He becomes intrigued by his Native American neighbors, a small tribe of Lakota Sioux, and slowly develops good relations with them. He ultimately adopts a Sioux name -- Dances With Wolves -- and completly assimilates with the tribe. When the U.S. Army discovers his actions he is treated as a treasonous deserter.Wow, I forgot how great ""Dances With Wolves"" is! This is, simply put, filmmaking of the highest order. Everything magically works in this absolutely engaging 3-hour epic Western (the extended version is 4 hours, which I haven't seen yet).Over the years I've heard some grumbling about the film's PC-influenced negative portrayal of whites in general and also its supposed romanticized portrayal of Indians as super-virtuous. Hence, before viewing the film again I was braced for the worst. After seeing it, I must say that most of these grumblings are utter hogwash. No kidding. Really, only a rigid white redneck ""patriot"" would take offense to this story (and, don't get me wrong, I'm patriotic but not mindlessly so). The film rings of authenticity and the characters are anything but one-dimensional. Want proof? (No major spoilers).- The Pawnee are the first Indians the viewer encounters in the film and they are portrayed as completely hostile to whites and other NA tribes -- so hostile that they'll kill a white person on sight without mercy. I'd say this is a negative, stereotypical portrayal of Indians, wouldn't you agree?- Also, Wind In His Hair clearly states that the Sioux should kill Dunbar at the council meeting; I'm sure there were others who agreed with him but it was ultimately decided that killing Dunbar would likely cause more problems than solve.- Not all white people are shown in a negative light; in fact, Dunbar himself -- the film's protagonist -- is white. What about the ""foul"" guy, Timmons, who escorts Dunbar to the abandoned fort? I've met people exactly like him. He's not portrayed as evil, merely uncouth in dress and manners. Anyway, when Timmons gets savagely murdered by a band of Pawnee he begs over and over that the Indians not hurt his mules; his dying words are words of love (for his animals!). Also, when he says goodbye to Dunbar at the fort he says, ""Good luck, Lieutenant"" and you know he means it; there was clear love and respect. Obviously this was a disgusting guy with a heart of gold. Again I know people just like him; it rings of authenticity.- The story takes place during the Indian Wars where there's very little love & compassion of whites towards Indians and vice versa. The U.S. Army is there to do a job and, as usual, go by the book. Is this a negative portrayal or simply the way it was? The answer is obvious. Hence, most of the officers are not shown in a negative light but merely as military leaders carrying out their duty. Although some of the main enlisted soldiers come off as clueless sheetheads, again, the characters ring of true life. I met people just like 'em in the military.- Besides, I repeat, not all Natives are depicted as virtuous. The Pawnee are obviously ruthless villains and quite a few Indians are shown helping the U.S. Army and are, therefore, traitors to their people.- Is the small tribe of Lakota Sioux really super-virtuous? Is their lifestyle really a paradise? No, they're merely portrayed as real people living, pursuing happiness, uncertain about the amassing whites, fighting and persevering through hardships (like the winter camp).- Is the massive annihilation of Bison (leaving their skinless carcasses to rot in the sun) a negative depiction of whites or just the way it was? Such people would likely shoot a wolf for the ""fun"" of it. Again, it smacks of reality.This is just a taste. Clearly, the people in the film are not as one-dimensional as some maintain. Neither is the movie as pro-Indian/anti-white as some insist. It's more complicated than that.As to the accuracy of the story itself, the fact is that many whites have ""gone injun"" and many Natives have assimilated with whites. The story explores the possibility of what would happen if a white man dropped all prejudices and tried to get along with some Sioux neighbors; and what if this small band of Natives was open and curious enough to accept him? Is it unlikely that this band would have an available good-looking white woman amongst them that Dunbar could fall in love with? Is there a bit of romanticization? Yes, but it is a Hollywood movie, after all. Regardless, it presented in a believable, compelling and captivating way.""Dances"" is almost 20 years old but remains timeless like most great films; it is the definition of why films are made.GRADE:
