Still have fond thoughts of them - met Michael Forest (BFHC) about 10 years ago -- he also played Apollo on Star Trek - got autographed photos of Apollo and Haunted Cave.  Of The Wasp Woman, extremely sad that to hear that her son beat her to death in 1986.

I when to the show as a kid in the early 60's & for 25 cent, I got to see two movies. Wow! I was in heaven, at that moment & yes, I saw all three at the show & love them & even now, I enjoy them as great old B-Movies & Roger, knew how to make them, cheap & fun & maded a damm good living from it. ""Creature From The Haunted Cave"" is fun & silly but, fun. ""Beast From Haunted Cave"" . I love to watch & The Wasp Woman, is Cult Classic & best of all three. So if you got time & love old Horror B-Movies from the 60's, all I can say is watch & rock on. Great price, all three on one DVD, how can miss great fun ....",5,"Fun,Fun & More Fun",1156464000,"08 25, 2006",2006,679,"['Creature', 'Movies', '..', 'are', 'just', 'great', 'camp', 'classics', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'when', 'show', 'kid', 'early', '60', '25', 'cent', 'got', 'see', 'two', 'movies', 'was', 'heaven', 'moment', 'yes', 'saw', 'three', 'show', 'love', 'even', 'now', 'enjoy', 'great', 'old', 'B-Movies', 'Roger', 'knew', 'how', 'make', 'cheap', 'fun', 'maded', 'damm', 'good', 'living', 'Creature', 'Haunted', 'Cave', 'fun', 'silly', 'fun', 'From', 'Haunted', 'Cave', 'love', 'watch', 'Wasp', 'Woman', 'Cult', 'Classic', 'best', 'three', 'So', 'got', 'time', 'love', 'old', 'Horror', 'B-Movies', '60', 'can', 'say', 'watch', 'rock', 'Great', 'price', 'three', 'one', 'DVD', 'how', 'can', 'miss', 'great', 'fun']",Roger Corman's - Creature Movies: (Creature From The Haunted Sea / Beast From Haunted Cave / The Wasp Woman)

OK, The Wasp Woman wasn't all THAT bad, but Creature from the Haunted Sea was literally one of the five worst movies I have ever seen, and Beast from Haunted Cave was one of the ten worst. But all in all I did not feel cheated, since I only paid $5.98, which is less than $2/movie. So buy it if you must, but don't expect to ""feel the magic"", because it just ain't there. Better off to put your money toward the Ed Wood Box or a copy of Robot Monster.",2,"OK, Corman has been hailed as a genius, but.........",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,483,"['movies', 'were', 'simply', 'awful', 'OK', 'Wasp', 'Woman', 'was', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'bad', 'Creature', 'Haunted', 'Sea', 'was', 'literally', 'one', 'five', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Beast', 'Haunted', 'Cave', 'was', 'one', 'ten', 'worst', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'cheated', 'only', 'paid', '5.98', 'less', '2/movie', 'So', 'buy', 'must', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'feel', 'magic', 'just', 'ai', ""n't"", 'there', 'Better', 'put', 'money', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Box', 'copy', 'Robot', 'Monster']",Roger Corman's - Creature Movies: (Creature From The Haunted Sea / Beast From Haunted Cave / The Wasp Woman)
675752,A2EXMGQEFLW0LD,B00005QW4T,"""waymakerjim""","[9, 9]","This DVD is terrific. I enjoyed all three movies, each with its own special flavor.The Beast From THe Haunted Sea is terrifically spoofy. It pokes fun at all the spy genre and the mass hysteria during the Cold War. A bumbling undercover spy infiltrates a wacky group of smugglers with deserters from the Cuban Army thrown in for good measure. The effects are lousy, the dialogue is intentionally awful but funny and th eBeast look like the Cookie Monster with Seaweed.THe BEast From Hacuted Cave is different, darker and not bad. It involves a criminal gang who steals some gold and tricks a heroic ski guide to take them to his cabin to hide out. During the robbery, a beast was awaken or freed by the explosion and follows the crooks and proceeds to capture them one by one. Only the heroic ski guide and the chief crook's moll excape.Corman has a flair for the dramatic and a good sense of what kind of story he wanted to tell. Unfortunately, his skills and budgets often prevented him from achieving his goals. Corman epitomizes the adageA man's grasp must exceed his reachElse what's a heaven for?!I will buy more of his works.",4,Corman is A Genius,1017187200,"03 27, 2002",2002,1132,"['DVD', 'terrific', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'movies', 'own', 'special', 'flavor.The', 'Beast', 'THe', 'Haunted', 'Sea', 'terrifically', 'spoofy', 'fun', 'spy', 'genre', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'Cold', 'War', 'bumbling', 'undercover', 'spy', 'wacky', 'group', 'smugglers', 'deserters', 'Cuban', 'Army', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'effects', 'are', 'lousy', 'dialogue', 'intentionally', 'awful', 'funny', 'th', 'eBeast', 'look', 'Cookie', 'Monster', 'Seaweed.THe', 'BEast', 'From', 'Hacuted', 'Cave', 'different', 'darker', 'not', 'bad', 'criminal', 'gang', 'who', 'gold', 'heroic', 'ski', 'guide', 'take', 'cabin', 'hide', 'out', 'robbery', 'beast', 'was', 'awaken', 'freed', 'explosion', 'crooks', 'proceeds', 'capture', 'one', 'one', 'Only', 'heroic', 'ski', 'guide', 'chief', 'crook', 'moll', 'excape.Corman', 'flair', 'dramatic', 'good', 'sense', 'what', 'kind', 'story', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Unfortunately', 'skills', 'budgets', 'often', 'prevented', 'achieving', 'goals', 'Corman', 'adageA', 'man', 'grasp', 'must', 'exceed', 'reachElse', 'what', 'heaven', 'will', 'buy', 'more', 'works']",Roger Corman's - Creature Movies: (Creature From The Haunted Sea / Beast From Haunted Cave / The Wasp Woman)
