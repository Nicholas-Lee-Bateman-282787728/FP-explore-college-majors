1490146,A2BLGSUV1SQQ4G,B005LAIIPS,,"[1, 2]","Upon seeing the trailer online back in the Summer, when the film was 1st in theaters, I was hyped-up. As a fan of the Bourne Trilogy since the 1st film (The Bourne Identity) in 2002, & as a collector of the films, I knew that I'd purchase it as soon as it was released. There are enough reviews regarding the plot of this film, so I'll leave that out. When the release date was announced on Amazon.com, I Pre-Ordered the DVD (w/out having seen the picture). I was especially excited that Edward Norton was added to the cast as Ret. USAF Col. Eric Byer, who happens to be the film's primary antagonist. Norton rarely portrays villans, so I was looking forward to his performance. 2ndly, I was thrilled that for the sake of continuity, Joan Allen (Pam Landy), David Stratharian (Noah Vosen), Scott Glenn (Ezra Kramer), & Albert Finney (Dr. Albert Hirsch) were cast in this film! Sadly to say, the amount of screen time that these 4 great actors (& characters) recieve amounts barley to cameo appearances. Heck, Finney's main scene was deleted & can only be viewed on the Deleted Scenes Special Feature! As for Jeremy Renner, his role as Aaron Cross is quite good, given the script that Renner was given. All-in-all, I was a little let-down by the film as a whole. It didn't have the Bourne film ""feel"" that the 1st 3 had, & felt more like a stand-alone picture. Although Director Tony Gilroy tried to attach a sense of continuity by bringing back actors/characters from the original trilogy, they didn't have nearly enough screen time to make it stick! In my opinion, the film's saving grace-Edward Norton! As 'Ric Byer, he's as ruthless, cold-blooded, & mechanical as ever & you can see that Norton loved playing the part.

They could either simply take another actor continue the role of Jason Bourne (much in the same way that the James Bond franchise keeps it going), or they could come up with a new story line separate (but not apart) from Jason Bourne. The producers decided on the latter.""The Bourne Legacy"" (135 min.) introduces us to Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner), who is another Jason Bourne-like former Army soldier rescued and enhanced by an experimental CIA program. For reasons not entirely made clear (to me anyway), the decision is made to shut down this program and all of the field agents are cast off, with the sole exception of Aaron Cross, who manages to dodge the various attempts on his life. Meanwhile we are also introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (played by Rachel Weisz), who is involved in the running of the program, and for reasons I don't want to explain so as not to spoil too much of the plot, now also is running for her life. Aaron and Marta team up, and how exactly it all plays out, you will just have to see it for yourself.Several comments: there are a number of hair-raising action scenes, none more so than in the last 45 min. of the movie, at which point all of the action takes places in Manila, the Phillipines. The action scenes are staged brilliantly and are never so over the top that they become laughable. Jason Renner does a great job in bringing us ""the next Jason Bourne"". But Rachel Weisz is the REAL star in my opinion. This is the 3rd time in short order that I've seen her recently in the theatres (after Dream House and The Deep Blue Sea), and she completely transfixes me, as she does again in this movie. Kudos also to writer-director (and ""Bourne"" veteran) Tony Gilroy, for bringing it all together in a credible and thoroughly enjoyable way.

I happened not to like those primarily because Jason Bourne was a bit more of a macho character. If you come to this movie expecting that... you may be disappointed.  This movie takes off with a bit of an older / wiser / more human lead character caught up in the CIA game. Aaron Cross. Aaron was in the army and presumably killed, but really went to CIA and became an agent. The movie starts a bit slow but I think it was necessary to telling a new story. The twist here is that Aaron was not exactly bright prior to joining the CIA. He is a hero that has been largely created via medical science -- given medication that made him smarter and more physically capable. There is a humanity to Aaron Cross that was missing with Jason Bourne. Aaron kills people for sure but you get the feeling he would have better judgment than Bourne. I believe it is also suggested that Aaron's fellow agents in a program called ""Outcome"" are trained to be more human than the typical CIA killer.The movie starts as the CIA is in complete crisis mode as the events surrounding the first three Bourne movies convince the CIA that they have to kill all the current tredstone or treadstone like agents to cover their tracks. They kill a lot of them but Aaron manages to survive and realizes what is happening. Aaron has one large problem though he is out of medications. He goes after the doctor who has been treating him in the program... Dr. Marta Shearing who is currently being targeted as well. They both go on the run and try to get the treatment that will allow Aaron not to be dependent on the medications.Clearly Marta is the love interest but the good news is that any romance was largely pushed off to future movies. They largely suggest that Aaron has a bit of a crush on Marta and she may have liked him too. But in this movie they are just friends that need each other.

1490165,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B005LAIIPS,Anthony L.,"[0, 0]","Now, in 2012, a NEW chapter has arrived to the Bourne franchise: The Bourne Legacy. Directed by Tony Gilroy, the man responsible for writing the previous trilogy, and starring Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton, and Joan Allen, The Bourne Legacy is an action-packed, globe-trotting, entertaining, action spy-thriller.The action scenes are kinetic, explosive, and exciting. They feel less brutal then Matt Damon's fights in The Bourne Ultimatum, but they are in no way less entertaining. In particular, a motorcycle chase in the Philippines will grip you by the tongue and pull you to the edge of your seat, your pulse-pounding. The suspenseful, hand-to-hand fights do NOT disappoint, filmed in shaky-cam, and filled with splintering, brutal blows and chops between 2 or more combatants.Action: 4.9 Stars! (Juuust short of a perfect score!)But the real reason why you should watch Legacy is Jeremy Renner. He gives a commanding presence to his character Aaron Cross, and of course, genuine badassery! His character is well-formed, memorable as far as action heroes go, and has a few half-decent one-liners (&#34;Come with me if you want to live&#34;).Of course, the inevitable comparison with Bourne arises. What do you expect? Nobody could ever beat Jason Bourne, even Aaron Cross. But he's cool, fit, charismatic, can fire a gun, beat up a bad guy, get the girl, and drive fast vehicles. What more could you ask for?...The Bourne Legacy is NOT without it's problems, however. I felt that Rachel Weisz's character was handled particularly clumsily, not doing much more than plot dumping and screaming during action scenes.The peerless Edward Norton (who usually rules every role he plays) is given no room to shine, and plays a cliched, one-dimensional villain. And that leads me to the main problem with the film - the script. Tony Gilroy is under NO circumstances a bad screenwriter or director, but this script is too small in scope to make much of an impact.The core of the film is Aaron Cross trying to &#34;viral off&#34; his chems. That is to say, retain the physical and mental benefits conferred by them, without actually having to consume them. Cross and Shearing spend the main portion of the film evading capture and travelling the globe from the US to Canada to the Phillipines to perform the operation needed for Cross to viral off. After I saw the film I got the feeling that Jason Bourne could have done the same thing in less than half the time. He would have gotten in, gotten on with it, gotten it over with, and gotten out in time for dessert.So in conclusion, Legacy suffers from some character and script problems....But don't let that deter you in the slightest! I urge you to watch The Bourne Legacy, preferably in HD on a big screen. It's one of 2012's best action-spy thrillers, with great action set pieces, exotic locations, (on the whole) great characters - both reccuring and original, and a stellar turn from Jeremy Renner!Here's to much more of the same!

1490187,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B005LAIIPS,C. B Collins Jr.,"[0, 0]","I found this film to be a well put together plot, with good character development, an exceptional cast of actors, and an underlying mystery that gradually emerges. The plot involves the basic concept that a man needs some medicine or knowledge or something to keep going, to keep existing.  However, this man is being chased. Along the way he meets folks who give him clues or help him a little until he finds the maiden in distress that happens to have the major clue to his needs. This is one of the most basic narratives in storytelling and in this film it is taken to great heights with exciting visuals. Jeremy Renner, who proved his exceptional acting skills in The Hurt Locker, plays Aaron Cross (#5). He has been genetically altered by the US government to be a fighting, brilliant, quick, long endurance spy.  However he is dependent on chemicals to keep going since the genetic process did not fully integrate with his genome to become permanent. In other words he can deteriorate like the genius who becomes mentally retarded in the film Charlie. Anyway, the science project goes wrong and the US Government decides to pull the plug on all these spies which is a bit more challenging that you think. Stacey Keach and Ed Norton play retired Navy and Air Force Officers who have to dismantle the program and dispose of the genetically altered spies. In these type stories, the hero in his quest to find the magic grail, the medicine that keeps him alive, discovers the maiden in distress, rescues her and then finds she has the secret to getting the grail. Some of the best scenes are when government agents descend on the home of Dr. Marta Shearing&#8217;s three story house in the wild woods and gradually their sweet talk reveals homicidal government fanatics. Rachel Weisz plays the PhD biogeneticist who helps #5 in his quest to find the treatment that will keep him alive. Oscar Isaac plays #3 up in the mountains of Canada ( I guess) and these tense scenes in the snowy mountains with wolves are a visual treat. The grail ends up in Manila and the motorcycle chase scenes in Manila are outstanding. Louis Ozawa Changchien is great as the next generation genetically modified agent who pursues Renner and Weisz through Manila. So we get a great cast who perform well in a plot that is a time proven as any can be. We also get great chase scenes and an unfolding mystery that is finally revealed to our hero and the audience at the same time. It may be formulaic but it still is very entertaining.",4,"Understandable plot, great chase scenes, and an unfolding mystery all make for good entertainment",1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,2511,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'well', 'together', 'plot', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'exceptional', 'cast', 'actors', 'underlying', 'mystery', 'gradually', 'plot', 'basic', 'concept', 'man', 'medicine', 'knowledge', 'something', 'keep', 'going', 'keep', 'existing', 'However', 'man', 'being', 'chased', 'way', 'folks', 'who', 'give', 'clues', 'help', 'little', 'maiden', 'distress', 'have', 'major', 'clue', 'needs', 'one', 'most', 'basic', 'narratives', 'storytelling', 'film', 'taken', 'great', 'heights', 'exciting', 'visuals', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'who', 'proved', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'skills', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Aaron', 'Cross', '5', 'been', 'genetically', 'altered', 'US', 'government', 'be', 'fighting', 'brilliant', 'quick', 'long', 'endurance', 'spy', 'However', 'dependent', 'chemicals', 'keep', 'going', 'genetic', 'process', 'did', 'not', 'fully', 'integrate', 'genome', 'become', 'permanent', 'other', 'words', 'can', 'deteriorate', 'genius', 'who', 'mentally', 'retarded', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Anyway', 'science', 'project', 'wrong', 'US', 'Government', 'pull', 'plug', 'spies', 'bit', 'more', 'challenging', 'think', 'Stacey', 'Keach', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'play', 'retired', 'Navy', 'Air', 'Force', 'Officers', 'who', 'have', 'dismantle', 'program', 'dispose', 'genetically', 'altered', 'spies', 'type', 'stories', 'hero', 'quest', 'find', 'magic', 'grail', 'medicine', 'alive', 'maiden', 'distress', 'then', 'secret', 'getting', 'grail', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'when', 'government', 'agents', 'descend', 'home', 'Dr.', 'Marta', 'Shearing', '8217', 'three', 'story', 'house', 'wild', 'woods', 'gradually', 'sweet', 'talk', 'reveals', 'homicidal', 'government', 'fanatics', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'PhD', 'biogeneticist', 'who', '5', 'quest', 'find', 'treatment', 'will', 'keep', 'alive', 'Oscar', 'Isaac', '3', 'up', 'mountains', 'Canada', 'guess', 'tense', 'scenes', 'snowy', 'wolves', 'are', 'visual', 'treat', 'grail', 'up', 'Manila', 'motorcycle', 'chase', 'scenes', 'Manila', 'are', 'outstanding', 'Louis', 'Ozawa', 'Changchien', 'great', 'next', 'generation', 'genetically', 'modified', 'agent', 'who', 'Renner', 'Weisz', 'Manila', 'get', 'great', 'cast', 'who', 'perform', 'well', 'plot', 'time', 'proven', 'can', 'be', 'also', 'get', 'great', 'chase', 'scenes', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'finally', 'revealed', 'hero', 'audience', 'same', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'formulaic', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining']",N/A

Though references and mentions are made of Jason Bourne, the storyline of this movie is an off-shoot of the Treadstone project storyline of the previous Bourne movies.  This story involves two other CIA agents; one, another Treadstone agent (similar to Bourne), played by Jeremy Renner; the other, a CIA doctor (Rachel Weisz) involved in the treatment of the agents.  In this storyline - not mentioned or included in previous Bourne movies - the agents in the Treadstone project were infected with a genetically manufactured virus, designed to enhance them for their functions as assassins.  They have to take pills (they call chems) in order to control the effects of the virus.  Meanwhile, when the CIA shuts down Treadstone (explained by the flashbacks and storyline convergence of Jason Bourne), they now have to kill all of the agents involved in that project.  So, after Renner survives an attack in the woods, and after Weisz survives an attack by a fellow brainwashed doctor who kills all other doctors, both of these two agents must now go rogue.  They are targets of the CIA and on the run.  They meet up and run together, with the main mission of going to Manila where the chems are manufactured in order for the doctor to get Renner off the pills (viralized) so he can be normal.  Meanwhile, the CIA is catching up to them, hot on their trail.  Also, the CIA engages a new program, called Larx... Another project with specially trained agents.  Now, they use a Larx agent to go after Renner and Weisz.  Once the two agents are on the run, the action picks up and the rest of the movie makes more sense.  Up until this time, it seems a bit confusing and slow.The ending is a big disappointment; following a chase scene in Manila, the two agents end up in an alley, where the doctor asks a local boy for help (because Renner is getting sick - from lack of his chems).  That cuts away to the usual cover-up scene, where there is a board of inquiry and explanations of how Pamela Landy's attempt to expose Blackbriar was contained, etc.  Then, back to Renner and Weisz, now aboard a Philippine passenger boat, cruising along and smiling, a bit of meaningless dialog and the familiar music ends it.  That's it, no summing up, no actual explanations.  This movie has a few good fight scenes and chase scenes, very much in the traditional Bourne style, but this fails to have the riveting action and intrigue of the other three Bourne movies.  I would not even compare it to the Bourne movies except that it is officially part of that Bourne saga.  On its own merit, this is a moderately good spy thriller.  But, when placed in the Bourne series, as it is, it falls very short.",3,Don't be confused...

The film isn't exactly a sequel to the the original Bourne films, as it takes place during the same time period as the Bourne Ultimatum. The script is smart in coinciding new plots involving Cross with events that occurred during Bourne's time on the screen.Renner does a very good job with the lead here, displaying the physical and mental extremes we've come to expect from a Bourne film. The supporting cast is also very good; Rachel Weisz portrays a frightened yet brilliant geneticist and Edward Norton is great as the government official that's trying to put an end to the program Cross belongs to.

1490204,AK9Q7JLFPP3BJ,B005LAIIPS,Darcy Bee,"[119, 155]","The Bourne Legacy does not feature Matt Damon's character, Jason Bourne.  Instead a new agent, Aaron Cross played by Jeremy Renner, is introduced.  Aaron Cross is similar to Jason Bourne in many ways and there are hints that he is a genetically improved version of the agents that Treadstone created.  Rachel Weisz plays Cross' romantic interest, Edward Norton plays the main antagonist, and Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Albert Finney, and Scott Glenn return as Landy, Vosen, Hirsch and Kramer, respectively, all from previous Bourne installments.The movie also attempts to tie in the previous Bourne movies and their plots into this installment.  Most interesting about this movie is that it builds on what we have learned in the last three movies, but promises that Jason Bourne was just the beginning and that the conspiracy is much larger than just the Treadstone project.After Treadstone was revealed by Bourne and Landy at the end of the third movie the CIA and top government officials attempt to erase all traces of Operation Outcome which includes disposing of Aaron Cross.  Operation Outcome is similar to Treadstone in that it creates assassins but the main difference is that the Outcome agents are 'created' with the use of genetic modification.  The central plot of the movie revolves around Renner's character, Aaron Cross, as he attempts to find more pills to sustain his super strength, intellect and ability, while dodging men sent to eliminate him and other Outcome agents.The movie itself started very slowly while they attempted to tie in everything from the last Bourne movie into this.  New scenes were inserted into Bourne film #3 to explain why the CIA was attempting to eliminate Project Outcome and then moves towards silencing Landy.  While it is much slower paced than the last Bourne film, the action scenes that were shown were amazing!  The rooftop chase was my favorite, and the ending seems much more carefree than the last three Bourne movies.  They also introduce LARX, another program where agents were genetically improved, and one of their agents goes after Cross.  Without any ties to Treadstone or Outcome, LARX seems to be given a free pass.  I wish more of that was explored or that the antagonist was harder to eliminate.

1490206,AGCVPCMDY4Q2W,B005LAIIPS,David Harvey,"[1, 1]","The Bourne Legacy essentially is a continuation of the Bourne Ultimatum, in fact much of the film runs in tandem with the Bourne Ultimatum in that there are references to Bourne being in Manhattan, Pamela Landy's work to implicateNoah Vosen, Ezra Kramer, and Dr. Albert Hirsch in their involvement with Treadstone, Blackbriar, and other operations.  What threw me for a loop was that everything that was established in the Bourne Ultimatum, that is all of the evidence that Bourne (or David Webb, take your pick) and Landy assembled to take down those involved with the program appears to be negated in The Bourne Legacy.  Well, maybe not negated, but we see Noah Vosen slithering through a plethora of words to essentially say &#34;what difference does it make!&#34; in reference to Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc.  The last we see of Pam Landy is her getting into a car, followed by the press, and telling them that if they want any other comments to speak with her lawyer but that she did not have any regrets about the choices/statements she had made.  So, maybe this is the storyteller's way of saying that those behind Treadstone, Blackbriar, etc. will be held accountable.That said, the Bourne Legacy centers around Aaron Cross, who is a member of another program called &#34;Outcome&#34; - essentially Treadstone but this program also uses physical and mental enhancing medications to regiment its operatives.  The events of the Bourne Ultimatum send those running Outcome to scurrying around like rats, feverishly working to scrap all evidence of the program to cover their rear-ends. Of course, their fail to eliminate Aaron Cross and one of the research scientists developing the medications, Dr. Marta Shearing - thus we have our new &#34;Jason and Marie&#34;.  They discover that Aaron has been weened off of the physical medication but the mental medications requires one last treatment, which takes them to Manilia (the capital of the Philippines) in order to obtain the medication.  Once done, it is a mad dash to go dark and avoid those behind Outcome.An intriguing idea, all in all, but the film feels like it is in need of a sequel (or at least an epilogue would have been helpful) to wrap up loose ends, maybe they are leaving that up to the audience.",4,The Bourne Ultimatum Continued,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,2268,"['Bourne', 'Legacy', 'essentially', 'continuation', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'fact', 'much', 'film', 'tandem', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'are', 'references', 'Bourne', 'being', 'Manhattan', 'Pamela', 'Landy', 'work', 'implicateNoah', 'Vosen', 'Ezra', 'Kramer', 'Dr.', 'Albert', 'Hirsch', 'involvement', 'Treadstone', 'Blackbriar', 'other', 'operations', 'What', 'threw', 'loop', 'was', 'everything', 'was', 'established', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'evidence', 'Bourne', 'David', 'Webb', 'take', 'pick', 'Landy', 'assembled', 'take', 'down', 'involved', 'program', 'be', 'negated', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'Well', 'maybe', 'not', 'negated', 'see', 'Noah', 'Vosen', 'slithering', 'plethora', 'words', 'essentially', 'say', '34', 'what', 'difference', 'make', '34', 'reference', 'Treadstone', 'Blackbriar', 'etc', 'last', 'see', 'Pam', 'Landy', 'getting', 'car', 'followed', 'press', 'telling', 'want', 'other', 'comments', 'speak', 'lawyer', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'regrets', 'choices/statements', 'had', 'made', 'So', 'maybe', 'storyteller', 'way', 'saying', 'Treadstone', 'Blackbriar', 'etc', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'said', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'centers', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'who', 'member', 'program', 'called', '34', 'Outcome', '34', 'essentially', 'Treadstone', 'program', 'also', 'physical', 'mental', 'enhancing', 'medications', 'regiment', 'operatives', 'events', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'send', 'running', 'Outcome', 'scurrying', 'rats', 'feverishly', 'working', 'scrap', 'evidence', 'program', 'cover', 'rear-ends', 'course', 'fail', 'eliminate', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'one', 'research', 'scientists', 'developing', 'medications', 'Dr.', 'Marta', 'Shearing', 'thus', 'have', 'new', '34', 'Jason', 'Marie', '34', 'discover', 'Aaron', 'been', 'weened', 'physical', 'medication', 'mental', 'medications', 'one', 'last', 'treatment', 'Manilia', 'capital', 'Philippines', 'order', 'obtain', 'medication', 'Once', 'done', 'mad', 'dash', 'go', 'dark', 'avoid', 'Outcome.An', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'film', 'feels', 'need', 'sequel', 'least', 'epilogue', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'maybe', 'are', 'leaving', 'audience']",N/A

I loved this paranoid, action-packed franchise with Matt Damon leading the madness and mayhem.  So I knew this installment had its work cut out for me to enjoy it, and now that I've seen THE BOURNE LEGACY several times, I truly believe it's the best of the bunch.  Jeremy Renner brings even more energy to the lead role, Agent Aaron Cross, and I never knew I would so enjoy a sneering Edward Norton as the CIA cover-up specialist determined to bring Cross down.  And to pay homage--if not much-needed continuity for plot purposes--to its predecessors, Scott Glenn, Joan Allen, Albert Finney, and David Strathairn all make brief appearances in character.Aaron Cross is not your typical Jason Bourne--he's Jason Bourne super charged.  The assassin has been genetically enhanced by his government handlers; his strength, agility, and intelligence are superhuman.  Only now, the CIA wants to cover up its tracks, destroy the evidence of Operation Outcome; to do this, every operative in the field must die.  So we have what we've enjoyed in all the Bourne predecessors--a 24/7 high tech chase, with Cross narrowly missing death at every turn.  Plus, he's accompanied by a government doctor who is herself on the Kill List (Rachel Weisz), forcing the two of them to flee to Manila in hopes of getting Cross to ""viral out.""  The climax is a heart-pounding motorcycle chase along the streets, alleys, and sidewalks of Manila--a chase that dares you not to be hanging on to your chair.  And finally, the ending to THE BOURNE LEGACY is what I enjoyed most of all.  It's open-ended, meaning another installment is on its white knuckle way.--D.

A secret project called Outcome has improved on the super-agents of the original Project Treadstone through chromosomal manipulation. We meet one of its products, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on survival training in Alaska, as the movie begins. As the movie unspools, we further learn that Cross's agency has decided to terminate the Outcome project with extreme prejudice, due to the unfavorable publicity of Jason Bourne's struggle with the CIA.In a suspenseful action sequence, Cross will survive a termination attempt in Alaska and escape. Inside the Outcome Laboratory, somewhere near Washington DC, Doctor Marta Shearing (Rachel Waitz) and her co-workers are also assaulted. Marta survives the attack in the lab, only to be pursued to her home in the country. In a second very good action sequence, Marta will be forced to trust her rescuer Cross and to face the consequences of her scientific work. Cross and Marta will go on the run to the Philippines, with Outcome in close pursuit, paving the way for a final, frenetic chase sequence in crowded Manila.&#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; features a number of well-executed action sequences. Renner and Waitz make a good team and are backed by a strong supporting cast, including Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. However, &#34;Legacy&#34; never quite achieves the compelling, suspensefully paranoid atmosphere of the original Jason Bourne movies. The heart of the mystery has already been given away, while the uneven pacing, the simplicity of the plot device that drives Cross's sense of urgency, and the flat ending were a little disappointing.  &#34;The Bourne Legacy&#34; is entertaining but not quite in the class of its predecessors.",4,Squeezing out one more Bourne movie...,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,1801,"['34', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', '34', 'artful', 'attempt', 'add', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'series', 'taking', 'story', 'secret', 'project', 'called', 'Outcome', 'improved', 'super-agents', 'original', 'Project', 'Treadstone', 'chromosomal', 'manipulation', 'meet', 'one', 'products', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'survival', 'training', 'Alaska', 'movie', 'movie', 'unspools', 'further', 'learn', 'Cross', 'agency', 'decided', 'terminate', 'Outcome', 'project', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'due', 'unfavorable', 'publicity', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'struggle', 'CIA.In', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'sequence', 'Cross', 'will', 'survive', 'termination', 'attempt', 'Alaska', 'escape', 'Outcome', 'Laboratory', 'somewhere', 'Washington', 'DC', 'Doctor', 'Marta', 'Shearing', 'Rachel', 'Waitz', 'co-workers', 'are', 'also', 'assaulted', 'Marta', 'attack', 'lab', 'only', 'be', 'pursued', 'home', 'country', 'second', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'sequence', 'Marta', 'will', 'be', 'forced', 'trust', 'rescuer', 'Cross', 'face', 'consequences', 'scientific', 'work', 'Cross', 'Marta', 'will', 'go', 'run', 'Philippines', 'Outcome', 'close', 'pursuit', 'paving', 'way', 'final', 'frenetic', 'chase', 'sequence', 'crowded', 'Manila.', '34', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', '34', 'number', 'well-executed', 'action', 'sequences', 'Renner', 'Waitz', 'make', 'good', 'team', 'are', 'backed', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Stacy', 'Keach', 'However', '34', 'Legacy', '34', 'never', 'quite', 'compelling', 'suspensefully', 'paranoid', 'atmosphere', 'original', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'heart', 'mystery', 'already', 'been', 'given', 'away', 'uneven', 'pacing', 'simplicity', 'plot', 'device', 'Cross', 'sense', 'urgency', 'flat', 'ending', 'were', 'little', 'disappointing', '34', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', '34', 'entertaining', 'not', 'quite', 'class', 'predecessors']",N/A

So, I'll skip that and go to a critique of the production itself.I gave this an overall rating of four stars because I found the movie to be interesting, engaging, with a good story and some really good action scenes.  I found that I cared about the primary characters - Renner and Weisz.  This tells me that the characters were fairly well developed and interestingRenner's character, Aaron Cross, would have been more compelling if more of his backstory came out sooner, and if his pathetic origin were presented differently.  I think Weisz' character could have used more backstory too - all I know about her is that she's an attractive scientist with a top secret clearance.The story is really good.  But this movie could have been a classic if the plot were tightened up and presented differently - too much dialogue where 'showing' instead of 'talking' would have got it across to the viewer better - this is especially true during the first part of the film.The camera work was excellent.  With more experience, I think Gilroy's skills in this area will improve to a level near Greengrass' excellent abilities.  Also, there's lots of good acting in this movie.On Rotten Tomatoes, the critics are currently tabulating at 51% positive, while the audience is at 70%.

Also the only thing ""Bourne"" about this film is the legacy part. Bourne's out of the picture (sorry), and is replaced by his legacy, Aaron Cross (played by Jeremy Renner). Actors from past Bourne movies include Joan Allen, David Strathairn, and Albert Finney. Ed Norton, Stacy Keach and Rachel Weisz are added to the credits.This is a movie you have to watch very closely. One bathroom break or trip to the refrigerator and you're done. You will not figure this out if you fast for a month and seek the answer in a vision. I finally pick up an idea of what the movie is about with Ed Norton's character who is trying to contain a Tread stone-like descendant operation, Operation Outcome that he is afraid will get out of control with scandalous outcomes. (Sorry again). The only way to do that is to kill the next generation of agents who are chemically engineered to perform significant feats of prowess and bravery. Rachel Weisz, stunning as ever, is Doctor Marta Shearing, or Doctor Death, as I like to call her. She administers dose and drug to the agents, and almost becomes a victim of the program when one scientist targets other scientists, killing everyone but her. The CIA sends another team pretending to be concerned caregivers to help her kill herself.Enter Aaron Cross who comes out of nowhere and we see the first real hand-to-hand combat action that is even more awesome as they increase camera speed until you can't even follow the blows and blocks anymore. Cross and Shearing join forces to discover why they have been targeted for elimination. The trail takes them to Manila with the Police and an assassin rounding out a great chase scene that begins on foot and ends up in motorcycles.The beginning of the movie is slow before going bipolar with a pace and script that is hard to follow. Flashbacks to previous Bourne movies and characters try to tie in the past (Bourne) to what's going on today (his legacy). If you haven't seen previous Bourne adventures, it can obfuscate as easily as clarify.  The best part for me was the mortal combat, the wolves, the sound during chases, and the part in Alaska.

I gave up wondering ""why"" after the first installment in this conspiracy series.  There is no purpose other than to keep repeating the same story, filled with the same types of characters doing exactly the same things for the same reasons.  It's amazing how many times they fill the same control room with the same people hunting down the same guy, having the same fearless leader order their death and no one bats an eye.

They present this version (of the same story!) in miniscule snippets that leave it feeling like a trailer teaser.

It's really quite simple. You either replace the lead actor and continue on or you somehow shift the focus of the movie onto another character. How hard can it be to find a director to replace another when the series is already a guaranteed payday?Universal Pictures made good decisions all the way around with ""The Bourne Legacy."" Instead of concentrating on the character of Jason Bourne, they altered the center of attention to other agents affected by the Blackbriar and Treadstone programs. Enter Aaron Cross, played by newly established action star Jeremy Renner (""Avengers"").Instead of just replacing Paul Greengrass with some other random director, they chose to go with someone very familiar with the series. Tony Gilroy co-wrote all the other ""Bourne"" films and stepped in to helm and pen the latest entry. He did an acceptable job balancing these two enormous jobs.I love a great action movie. I also love a good spy thriller. It makes perfect sense that a movie like ""The Bourne Legacy"" would appeal to me. For the most part it did. However, somewhere along the line a feeling of tedium set in. It didn't stick with me throughout the film. It just came and went. Sometimes I think I've seen too many of these types of movies and the excitement has worn off.One thing I really enjoyed about the film was the sense of realism director Gilroy captured. He doesn't lean on a crutch of CGI like so many of these action films do these days. It reminds me of the newer James Bond films. When you see Daniel Craig and Jeremy Renner jump onto the ledge of a building or cliff and slam into it, you know it hurt. You don't look at the scene and go, ""They used a miniature for that or digitally enhanced it.""The high-definition transfer of the film gives viewers a pristine picture and an engrossing audio experience. The clarity of the video doesn't compromise the gritty atmosphere the movie holds. The 7.1 surround sound will cause some home theater audiences to jump out of their seat frequently as explosions and gunfire ring out from different speakers.The Blu-ray edition of ""The Bourne Legacy"" comes with some impressive bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by director / co-writer Tony Gilroy, co-writer Dan Gilroy, editor John Gilroy, second unit director Dan Bradley, director of photography Robert Elswit, and production designer Kevin Thompson.Five featurettes focus on everything from casting to shooting locations and working with real and animatronic wolves. They include ""Re-Bourne,"" ""Capturing Chaos: The Motor Bike Chase,"" ""Enter Aaron Cross,"" ""Crossing Continents,"" ""Moving Targets,"" and ""Man vs. Wolf."" There are also three deleted scenes and an animated storyboard / footage reel titled ""Wolf Sequence Test.""""The Bourne Legacy"" Blu-ray will give action fans and enthusiasts of the franchise something to satisfy their need for a fresh kick of adrenaline. It does get bogged down at times with plot-pushing dialogue, but you can't really fault filmmakers for wanting to give the audience something with substance. Although it's a great outlet for people to see Jeremy Renner in a very physical action role again, I don't think this will be remembered as one of the better entries in the series either now or in the future.""The Bourne Legacy"" is available in a Blu-ray Combo Pack with Ultraviolet, DVD and a digital copy right now.",3,"Blu-ray Review: ""The Bourne Legacy""",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",2013,3511,"['What', 'do', 'do', 'when', 'original', 'director', 'actor', 'successful', 'franchise', ""'re"", 'building', 'backs', 'upcoming', 'sequel', 'already', 'planned', 'really', 'quite', 'simple', 'either', 'replace', 'lead', 'actor', 'continue', 'somehow', 'shift', 'focus', 'movie', 'character', 'How', 'hard', 'can', 'be', 'find', 'director', 'replace', 'when', 'series', 'already', 'guaranteed', 'payday', 'Universal', 'Pictures', 'made', 'good', 'decisions', 'way', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'Instead', 'concentrating', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'altered', 'center', 'attention', 'other', 'agents', 'affected', 'Blackbriar', 'Treadstone', 'programs', 'Enter', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'played', 'newly', 'established', 'action', 'star', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Avengers', '.Instead', 'just', 'replacing', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', 'other', 'random', 'director', 'chose', 'go', 'someone', 'very', 'familiar', 'series', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'co-wrote', 'other', 'Bourne', 'films', 'stepped', 'helm', 'pen', 'latest', 'entry', 'did', 'acceptable', 'job', 'balancing', 'two', 'enormous', 'jobs.I', 'love', 'great', 'action', 'movie', 'also', 'love', 'good', 'spy', 'thriller', 'perfect', 'sense', 'movie', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'would', 'appeal', 'most', 'part', 'did', 'However', 'somewhere', 'line', 'feeling', 'tedium', 'set', 'did', ""n't"", 'stick', 'film', 'just', 'came', 'went', 'Sometimes', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'excitement', 'worn', 'thing', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'sense', 'realism', 'director', 'Gilroy', 'captured', ""n't"", 'lean', 'crutch', 'CGI', 'so', 'many', 'action', 'films', 'do', 'days', 'newer', 'James', 'Bond', 'films', 'When', 'see', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'jump', 'ledge', 'building', 'cliff', 'slam', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'scene', 'go', 'used', 'miniature', 'digitally', 'enhanced', 'high-definition', 'transfer', 'film', 'viewers', 'pristine', 'picture', 'engrossing', 'audio', 'experience', 'clarity', 'video', ""n't"", 'compromise', 'gritty', 'atmosphere', 'movie', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'will', 'cause', 'home', 'theater', 'audiences', 'jump', 'seat', 'frequently', 'explosions', 'gunfire', 'ring', 'out', 'different', 'speakers.The', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'impressive', 'bonus', 'material', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'director', '/', 'co-writer', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'co-writer', 'Dan', 'Gilroy', 'editor', 'John', 'Gilroy', 'second', 'unit', 'director', 'Dan', 'Bradley', 'director', 'photography', 'Robert', 'Elswit', 'production', 'designer', 'Kevin', 'Thompson.Five', 'focus', 'everything', 'casting', 'shooting', 'locations', 'working', 'real', 'animatronic', 'wolves', 'include', 'Re-Bourne', 'Capturing', 'Chaos', 'Motor', 'Bike', 'Chase', 'Enter', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'Crossing', 'Continents', 'Moving', 'Targets', 'Man', 'vs', 'Wolf', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'animated', 'storyboard', '/', 'footage', 'reel', 'titled', 'Wolf', 'Sequence', 'Test', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'Blu-ray', 'will', 'give', 'action', 'fans', 'enthusiasts', 'franchise', 'something', 'satisfy', 'need', 'fresh', 'kick', 'adrenaline', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'times', 'plot-pushing', 'dialogue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'fault', 'filmmakers', 'wanting', 'give', 'audience', 'something', 'substance', 'great', 'outlet', 'people', 'see', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'very', 'physical', 'action', 'role', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'better', 'entries', 'series', 'either', 'now', 'future', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'available', 'Blu-ray', 'Combo', 'Pack', 'Ultraviolet', 'DVD', 'digital', 'copy', 'right', 'now']",N/A

1490239,A2P3PPVN379V79,B005LAIIPS,"FBI ""Film Buff Inc.""","[0, 0]","***WARNING - SOME PLOT SIGNPOSTS/SPOILERS AHEAD***There are two ways to compare this film, in relation to the previous Bourne films, and compared to other thrillers and films generally.Firstly - how does it stack up against the prior 3 Bourne films, all of which I thought were masterfully executed by all concerned.Answer: If anything, there was a freshness and an edge to this instalment that a fourth instalment with Matt Damon as Bourne perhaps would have carried less successfullyWhile Damon is obviously 'Jason Bourne' incarnate, I think it was tactically a very wise decision to leave it at three great films and not chance a fourth (The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull illustrates just how bad a great idea can misfire in execution...).The difficult thing that the producers/director managed to traverse very well was that the latest film is, as the title says, abour Bourne's Legacy, which suggests, I guess, that it is a tidying up of the mess that unfolded in the previous three instalments,  (the Treadstone Program, unsanctioned black ops, ...).Jeremy Remner (I think that spelling is correct) is a very different actor on screen to Damon, far less emotion on screen, there was none of the turmoil Bourne was constantly dealing with.It therefore takes a while to adjust to the switch. But by the time the first major action set piece arrives in which Remner's character can show his wares, I was completely won over.Remner has assumed the mantle (I don't know whether he would appreciate me putting it quite like that) with characteristic applomb.Anyone who saw Remner in The Town or The Hurt Locker will know what a tremendous presence and intensity he brings to his roles.Turning to a comparison to other contemporary cinema releases generally, I can say without a doubt that I thought it was falwlessly put together, great cast also including Rachel Weisz, and David Stathairn and Joan Allen reappear.I loved especially the way the previous Bourne movies were brought in to the story to show that the unfolding drama in The Bourne Legacy was taking place concurrently with events (in the earlier film at least).It was quite simply the most enjoyable film I have seen this Australian summer.I would rate it 5 out of 5. For comparison, I would probably give Skyfall 3.5/5 (the Skyfall story was threadbare by comparison).Note for parents: There are some fairly disturbing scenes in this instalment, for example where a co-worker with a pistol runs amok in a secure laboratory, which amounts to a gun spree - so as close as this is to the recent shootings in Newtown, (I am typing this in Feb., 2013) parents might like to keep such scenes away from younger eyes.At the start I wasn't sure what this instalment of the Bourne series would amount to, but it is great to walk into a cinema and not know what is going to happen. By the end credits the next instalment had been set up perfectly, the same closing song we have come to expect kicked in, and I knew I had just seen something where everyone had done a quite brilliant job in every department.I highly recommend The Bourne Legacy.I have watched it a few times on DVD since, and have enjoyed it equally as much.As we say Down Under, the next instalment is shaping up to be '' an absolute cracker'!",5,The Bourne franchise is in good hands,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,3264,"['***WARNING', 'SOME', 'PLOT', 'SIGNPOSTS/SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***There', 'are', 'two', 'ways', 'compare', 'film', 'relation', 'previous', 'Bourne', 'films', 'compared', 'other', 'thrillers', 'films', 'generally.Firstly', 'how', 'stack', 'up', 'prior', '3', 'Bourne', 'films', 'thought', 'were', 'masterfully', 'executed', 'concerned.Answer', 'anything', 'was', 'freshness', 'edge', 'instalment', 'fourth', 'instalment', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Bourne', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'less', 'successfullyWhile', 'Damon', 'obviously', ""'Jason"", 'Bourne', 'incarnate', 'think', 'was', 'tactically', 'very', 'wise', 'decision', 'leave', 'three', 'great', 'films', 'not', 'chance', 'fourth', 'Kingdom', 'Chrystal', 'Skull', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'great', 'idea', 'can', 'misfire', 'execution', 'difficult', 'thing', 'producers/director', 'managed', 'traverse', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'latest', 'film', 'title', 'abour', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'guess', 'tidying', 'mess', 'unfolded', 'previous', 'three', 'instalments', 'Treadstone', 'Program', 'unsanctioned', 'black', 'ops', '.Jeremy', 'Remner', 'think', 'spelling', 'correct', 'very', 'different', 'actor', 'screen', 'Damon', 'far', 'less', 'emotion', 'screen', 'was', 'none', 'turmoil', 'Bourne', 'was', 'constantly', 'dealing', 'with.It', 'therefore', 'while', 'adjust', 'switch', 'time', 'first', 'major', 'action', 'set', 'piece', 'arrives', 'Remner', 'character', 'can', 'show', 'wares', 'was', 'completely', 'won', 'over.Remner', 'assumed', 'mantle', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'appreciate', 'putting', 'quite', 'characteristic', 'applomb.Anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Remner', 'Town', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'tremendous', 'presence', 'intensity', 'roles.Turning', 'comparison', 'other', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'releases', 'generally', 'can', 'say', 'doubt', 'thought', 'was', 'falwlessly', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'cast', 'also', 'including', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'David', 'Stathairn', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'loved', 'especially', 'way', 'previous', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'were', 'brought', 'story', 'show', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'concurrently', 'events', 'earlier', 'film', 'least', '.It', 'was', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'Australian', 'summer.I', 'would', 'rate', '5', '5', 'comparison', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'Skyfall', '3.5/5', 'Skyfall', 'story', 'was', 'threadbare', 'comparison', '.Note', 'parents', 'are', 'fairly', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'instalment', 'example', 'where', 'co-worker', 'pistol', 'amok', 'secure', 'laboratory', 'gun', 'spree', 'so', 'as', 'close', 'recent', 'shootings', 'Newtown', 'am', 'typing', 'Feb.', '2013', 'parents', 'might', 'like', 'keep', 'such', 'scenes', 'away', 'younger', 'eyes.At', 'start', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'instalment', 'Bourne', 'series', 'would', 'amount', 'great', 'walk', 'cinema', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'end', 'next', 'instalment', 'had', 'been', 'set', 'up', 'perfectly', 'same', 'closing', 'song', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'kicked', 'knew', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'something', 'where', 'everyone', 'had', 'done', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'job', 'department.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Bourne', 'Legacy.I', 'have', 'watched', 'few', 'times', 'DVD', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'equally', 'much.As', 'say', 'Down', 'next', 'instalment', 'shaping', 'up', 'be', 'absolute', 'cracker']",N/A

However,for the viewers with a little higher IQ the story is much deeper than that. As the secret operations and mastermind behind those assassin programs reveal itself, NRAG, who is headed by Eric Byer played by Edward Norton. Edward does a fantastic job playing the mastermind of all those programs. His explanation of the ""SIN EATER"" was the main moral of the story.Overall, the movie is excellent and ranks up there with the best of the other Bourne flicks perhaps even better. The movie starts a little slow trying to aim the viewer on the justification of killing their latest assassin program Outcome. Then at exactly 30 minutes into the movie the action starts and keeps you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the movie. Blueray makes a difference.Jeremy Renner and Rachel Wieisz were superb in their acting. They played their parts very well. Renner was an excellent agent whose part had to stand up to the footsteps of Damon and did so successfully. Rachel as the mad scientist was very believable.

This is a `legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such, for this reviewer, it works very well.  The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography, has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.As someone distilled the plot, `this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of ""Operation Blackbriar"" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. ""Outcome"", the program in question is an offshoot of both ""Treadstone"" and ""Blackbriar"" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.' &#8232;Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting.  Jeremy Renner is excellent, always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations.  The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney, Oscar Isaac, David Strathairn, and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.The speed of the action, the poundingly purposeful musical score and the non-stop fascinating twists and turns make this a top-notch film.  It does carry on the `legacy' of Ludlum's ideas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals.

However, upon viewing the movie I realized that Renner was playing a completely different character and that the story just contained a matter that Bourne had been involved in, so it was one of the scenarios like ""Oh, ok...I seen now.""Overall I found myself enjoying the movie, as did my dad, who I'd gone to see this with.  He and I both really enjoy the spy action type movies like these and the Bond movies & such and often go and see those types of movies together.  I felt the story was compelling and engaging, and I felt the overall acting within this film was top notch, especially on the part of Renner and Weisz.  If you really want a more in depth, detailed review of what I thought of the movie, read the 4 star rating at the top of the reviews by D.T. Jewett entitled A Movie In Search of a Director...I don't think I could have written a better review myself on this movie, and his opinion is basically about the same as I felt about the movie, give or take maybe one or two minor little things but it's overall about the same that I felt.To boil it all down, if you love spy thriller/action movies I recommend this!

I'm a fan of the original series with Matt Damon, but I encourage first-time viewers not to begin by comparing this one to those, because there are some differences. First, I thought Jeremy Renner did an excellent job. He's a much different actor than Damon, so he brought something new to the Bourne series. The on-screen pair up with Rachel Weisz was genius--I thought they played excellently off each other and their chemistry was just right. I suppose I didn't dissect the script too much because I was looking for a great action movie and that's what I got, but I didn't feel the writing was bad either. The scenery in the beginning of the movie was breathtaking, which is always a bonus for me. Those looking for another Bourne movie like the originals may be disappointed (though I honestly don't know why they would be), but those looking for a fun, non-stop action movie with some drama, and great acting by some great stars, would likely enjoy this movie.

But I am disappointed in a way.The action is probably perfect though it is only an escape and not a chase to impose a positive end, only to get away from those who are chasing you. That's weak. For sure we have Manilla and the cars, the motorbikes, the hunt on the roofs and even a long hike in Alaska. I must say that the wolves are superb animals and that it is a shame so many are killed. Though a drone and a missile for one wolf seems slightly expensive.The plot is simple but unexplained at all. The secret security services of the USA have set up several programs to fight against terrorism, each one of them totally entangled into the others but with one probably slightly more central than the others. A hostile foreign agency that is not identified is trying to get this program and this program has a fair chance to get out because the main people who devised it are not under control. So the decision is taken to destroy the program and to get rid of all those who have been in touch with it, no matter how little.The worst part is that even the uniformed generals (note the only one that is brought up is black: no allusion to the president that we all know to be powerless) do not know about the situation and it is a handful of bureaucrats of these security agencies that have no public front who take decisions and implement the decisions they take under absolutely no control from whoever you may imagine. The President is not even mentioned. In other words they are, these bureaucrats a state in the sate. The USA have reinvented ,the KGB, the STASI, and those had a public front, even the SS was not completely invisible.Unluckily this theme has already been explored vastly in the genre over the last fifty years.It goes slightly further when we learn that this program aimed at producing super human people who did not feel pain, who had an IQ over 200 and who were as strong as aliens. These prototypes were nine and are still six and they have to be eliminated along with all the people who worked on this program. These prototypes were produced by some genetic manipulation of viruses or retroviruses to change the human genome of the individuals who are infected with these genetically modified viruses. But here again that has been used and overused, some could say abused, over the last fifty years in all media imaginable.To amplify this lack of originality we have to regret the very editing of the film that lines up short sequences that have no relation whatsoever one to the other, no ellipse possible, and that do not make sense for at least a good fourth of the film. This is also quite surprising and disappointing. Jason Bourne had made sure in the previous films that we should know the targets and agents, who is who from the very start and to have a real objective that brought down these security bureaucrats and gave decisional power back to those elected and appointed for that under the strict control of the Senate.That explains my slight disappointment.

This film sort of runs in parallel with the ending of the third installment where Dammon's character , Jason Bourne, exposes the &#34;Treadstone&#34; and &#34;Blackbriar &#34; government operations to the media.The newest operation is called &#34;Outcome&#34; and this is where Renner picks up as Aaron Cross. The new agent is genetically modified via science through a system of pills that makes him sort of superhuman. The problem is, he is running out of these meds and needs to find more. He basically starts to crash at about the same time the &#34;Outcome&#34; project has been terminated. This is where he meets up with Dr. Shearing (Weise) who is one of the doctors that worked on the genetic medicine which gives Renner his strength, speed, and high level of cognition. They stay on the run together trying not to be assassinated like everyone else connected to the new operation. The director over the new government operations is played by Edward Norton. His performance in this movie is barely memorable and lacks that of the previous director of operations played by David Strathairn.Overall if you have seen the previous three movies, you will be more than likely disappointed in this fourth installment. It is very hard to follow and seems as if it has nothing to do with the original Bourne series which we have watched over and over.The actors in this film are great actors, but I think the director is what made this movie a miss for us.

The movie follows on the path of destruction that these agencies create once they have made the decision to &#34;roll-up&#34; a program and the utter lack of humanity.

He knows his seemingly super powers will soon follow, and he will go through withdrawal. They send a drone to destroy him in a remote cabin in Alaska.

Jenkins ""Opinionated One!""","[0, 0]","I loved the previous Bourne films and think Jeremy Renner is quite the leading man, but this film left me frustrated and a bit sad that Matt Damon is left off screen, as he IS the only Bourne to truly care about. The exposition on this film is tedious, slow and confusing. It's not until they have Rachael Weisz's character deliver a necessary and clarifying monologue in a speeding car that you truly get what the first half of the film was about. The last act of the chase is tired and truly unconvincing. I don't care what meds you're on, you're not likely to know how to drive a motorcycle down a railing, much less stay on the bike if you're a passenger. The whole concept of YET ANOTHER SECRET AGENCY to justify sending an assassin (who has NOT ONE line of dialgoue and his presence is just there to be the EVIL BOUNTY HUNTER WITH AN ASIAN SNEER) into the story at the end was ludicrous and when the film ends, it JUST ENDS with no sense of connection to the overall map the Bourne series created. Ed Norton's character comes in out of nowhere and all he does is bark orders--the one scene where he interacts with Renner's character is limp and doesn't explain much. But the film seems to care less about explanations and just wants to push you to the final act. Even the film's opening just has you going ""HUH?"" as they never really explain the point of Renner being in the snowy wonderland other than it being an ""exercise."" An exercise in what? The use of a pretty environment? The saving graces of this film are Renner and Wiesz. Both are gifted actors and lots of fun to watch.

1490285,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIIPS,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Coming off of the fantastic Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon I was a little skeptical when I heard that Damon wasn't going to be in this latest entry, but Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job. Having enjoyed the original trilogy, I was excited when I first heard of Legacy. I never read the books so I was fortunate enough to not have them get in the way of my enjoyment. However I do know that the movies don't really follow the books at all.The film takes place during the time of The Bourne Ultimatum. Namely, we start at the point when Simon Ross gets shot at Waterloo Station. Now I was a little taken back because I kind of thought this would be it's own separate story, which it is in it's own right, but Bourne is mentioned a handful of times. Although, now that I think about it, I think I enjoyed the film more because they found a way to tie these two stories together.One of the main issues people had with the original trilogy was the shaky camera during the fight sequences and even during some of the dialogue-heavy scenes. Thankfully that has been improved drastically. During some of the action scenes it does get a little crazy, but it's a big improvement from before. However, compared to the the original trilogy, the action scenes weren't as frequent. The first half was trying to shape the story and get you used to the characters, while the second half really picks up the pace. Which brings me to my next point.Even though I really enjoyed the film I felt the story was a little weak at times and they didn't always do a great job of explaining why something happened. Which left some scenes feeling kind of pointless. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) seems to be the main antagonist, but they do very little to explain his character or even his job. From the viewers point of view he wants to kill all the participants of Treadstone, but we're left ignorant as to why. At least that's how I felt after watching it.Even though I did have some small gripes with the story my main problem was that the ending, for me, was a little anticlimactic. I wasn't expecting the film to end after the chase scene and I kind of felt like it just ended abruptly. It did leave possibilities for another film though, which is always nice. I must say that the entire cast did a fantastic job.

1490293,AHQBXGFFMBBC9,B005LAIIPS,kazper,"[1, 1]","There's no reason this movie should have been included in the Bourne saga. It seemed like a cheap ploy to sell more movie tickets.I knew going in it wasn't based on the Jason Bourne character, which is a shame. I've read almost all of the Bourne books, including the Bourne Legacy. The movie was NOTHING like the book at all! Therefore, in my mind they should not have used the title. In the book, it is titled legacy because it features Jason's son from his first marriage. This movie features a random character in one of the super secret government training programs.Reasons I didn't like this movie:Chems-  all of the assets are on pill form drugs that improve their strength and mental faculties. It made it extremely easy and convenient to wipe out the entire program by simply switching their pills to some variant of cyanide.Fighting- Not much to speak of. There are always several more fights in the books than the movies. This was no different, but features almost no fighting at all. From my count: fight with wolf (if you can even count that), fight with agents to save Rachel Weisz (probably one of the best fight sequences in the movie), fight in the factory (lasted about 10 seconds), and fight in the alleyway (again, 5 seconds). Quite the disappointment.Weaving into Bourne storyline- there were a few nods to events from the third film. They seemed very half hearted and could easily be missed, especially with amount of time that passed (in real life) between 3 and legacy. Mostly, they came off as an afterthought like ""if we have Bourne in the title, we should include this event in the storyline"". Pathetic, really.The best scene of the movie was arguably the chase sequence at the end. But there was a point where it seemed WAY too unbelievable. Almost like the Peter Griffin fighting the chicken scene. The opposing assassin survives a major car wreck, steals a motorcycle, pounces  from one motorcycle to another, somehow manages to catch up to Cross and his companion, and then takes 1 or 2 shots and flips into a fruit stand. At that point wouldn't you simply call it a day, realize you've been beaten? Apparently not. He brushes himself off, mounts the bike, and catches up again! Seriously, I need that bike!

1490300,A2EP52TE6GH8OB,B005LAIIPS,Kevin Millward,"[0, 0]","While this movie was a disappointment, I have to say, there were a lot of great things about this film.  First and foremost, the action was spectacular.  A combination of artistic cinematography, graceful and intentional editing, and well-paced choreography made for some stellar action scenes.  The Bourne movies are well known for their great fast-paced, quick-cut action scenes, and this film does not fail to continue that style.  I would dare to say that the action alone in this film warrants a viewing.  One scene in particular caught my eye.  It was a scene where a doctor shoots up the lab he is working in.  This was a very terrifying scene, even for a PG-13 rating.  It felt very realistic and although it was a dark scene, it was very well done.  A more subtle element I liked about this film was the continuation of the water theme.  Every Bourne film starts with a water theme, and they continued this into the fourth film.  It helps connect the films in a way and I really liked that.  I also liked the cast of Edward Norton, although I wish I would have seen more of his character.  Rachel Weisz's performance was good, although I greatly disliked her character.  All her character did was scream, yell, and beg for Aaron to save her in several points in the film.  I was indifferent about Jeremy Renner.  I liked him as an action star, but I don't think he or anyone else for that matter should be taking the place of Matt Damon.Other than the action scenes, this film lacked many of the elements that made the first three Bourne films so good, specifically the pacing.  This movie was EXTREMELY slow for a Bourne film.  There was probably 15 minutes of solid action in this movie, and I expected more from a Bourne movie, whether Matt Damon starred or not.  The trailer gave away most of the good parts of the film, which is probably why I was so disappointed.  Also, for whatever reason, Matt Damon's character was repeatedly brought up throughout the film.  If we're not going to see him on screen, there's no reason to bring him up.  Every mention of Jason Bourne made me think about how cheap the writers were being trying to transition from one actor to the other.  Another complaint I had was how awkwardly the movie ended.  Immediately after an intense motorcycle chase, we are suddenly on a boat in the ocean with Aaron and Marta, and they escape, more or less, away from everything.  It seemed like there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up, rather than jumping straight from the climax of the film to the end.  That was a very jarring way to end the film and left me with a bad feeling walking out of the theater, which is something good filmmakers never do.The latest Bourne film is more of a redundancy than a legacy.  I'm not saying that Matt Damon's absence from this film is the reason it wasn't very good, but it's hard to watch a movie of this caliber with a well-established star without having him in the back of your mind.

There are many holes in it and it seems like they rushed to film it and get it out quickly to make some money.  The good:  Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz had great chemistry and gave top notch performances with what they were given, specifically Rachel Weisz was incredible and really lets loose in this.  The bad:  The first hour of this film may put the average viewer to sleep mumbling, ""What is this?""  Nothing happens, its choppy and barely makes any sense.  The film kicks into high gear in the last hour, but by then it may feel like, too little too late for some.  Jeremy Renner is hardly in it the first hour.  When he is, he's dodging wolves, jumping in water and you can't figure out what his deal is.  There are plot holes scattered throughout this.  Let's not even get started on why it's called, ""Bourne Legacy"" when it has nothing to do with Jason Bourne.  They shoud've called it, ""The Cross Legacy"" for the character Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner.  We all know if they did that or changed the name, then no one would have gone to see this.  They had to capitalize on the Bourne name to pack the theater otherwise this movie would have been lost in the shuffle.  This is also why there are comparisons to the Bourne series because of the name.  Edward Norton is an awesome actor and played a thankless role in this where they could've got any no name to play it.  This felt more like a Sunday afternoon TV movie.

The entire organization of specially programmed people with double agendas is cancelled and this includes killing everyone involved.Taking the seat front and center now is Jeremy Remer (The Avengers, The Hurt Locker) playing Aaron Cross, a character who starts out with one idea of what his purpose is and then suddenly realizes that he has to avoid the very people who are programing him with drugs. He does a great job as the impartial, intelligent and super-athletic man-killer he is programmed to be while realizing he's now the target of the organizations destruction.Ironically he finds a friend in the very medical community that is inducing him with his super-human drug addiction, artfully played by Rachel Weizs. Her initial ignorance to the big picture of what she is actually contributing too changes abruptly and she soon learns that Jeremy's character is sincere in his attempts to beat the system that built him.The movie is filled with fights, killing snipers, running and car chases of incredible detail but with a wonderful visual flow that makes some of these sequences seem a little too unlikely to actually happen in real life.Some other notable performances include Stacey Keach (American History X, The Bourne Legecy) and Edward Norton (The Incredible Hulk, Fight Club) as the people in charge of the agency that decides it needs to shut down its super-spy program. Donna Murphy (Star Trek: Insurrection, Tangeled) put in a small put tough character who realizes Jeremy has figured out that they are after him and he in turn goes after them.The film is completely more action than story and has some good moments of double jeopardy that you really can't guess which way the action is going.

Bourne Legacy is less of a sequel, and more of a spin off.Certainly elements of it work very well. Jeremy Renner brings his own brand of intensity to the role, and I like Rachel Weisz as the doctor with whom he goes on the run. I loved the way the scene in her house unfolded with all its twists and turns.Renner plays a character not named Bourne, but a former soldier named Aaron Cross. Unlike Bourne he remembers everything but seems to be unaware that he was part of a sinister experiment testing for biological weaponry, and he constantly needs medication or something bad will happen.It's several years later. Treadstone has become an embarrassment, requiring clean up before it gets even more embarrassing.In covert parlance cleanup means kill. He has been part of a biological warfare experiment though he seems unaware of this, and has to take certain medication. He does have mad lethal skills like Bourne, and he is extremely resourceful. So he becomes the loose end that fights back.Edward Norton brings his A game as the spook on his trail, giving an outstanding performance and the array of technology at his disposal is impressive.Matt Damon's Bourne movies are a hard act to follow, nevertheless Bourne Legacy does have its moments. I liked the fact that the answer to the problem lay in the Phillipines, and Cross is resourceful enough to fake a passport with new identities while both he and the doctor are being searched for at the highest levels, and the impressive technology being used to catch them is actually pretty scary. I also found the drone sequences in the wilderness very engaging.Can they really do all this?I particularly liked the action sequences particularly the motorbike chase scene in the Philippines, and how the doctor initially lacking any defense skills before she meets Cross, now gets some aggression and contributes realistically to a memorable action sequence, while will probably be the strongest memory I take from this movie.If you are a Bourne fan, and seen all the movies, your reaction might be similar to mine, I found it a worthwhile experience, and I think that most people having enjoyed the previous Bourne movies will enjoy this too.

The screenplay was excellent and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz bring so much to the characters of Aaron Cross and Marta Shearing.  What could have been a straightforward, no-emotion plot turns out to be a nail-biting thriller.  The cinematography is great for bringing out the details and adding depth to this incredible movie. The beginning was startlingly quick and real.  The rooftop/street chase was absolutely amazing; the best chase sequence I've seen yet on screen.  The ending was perfect.  I consider this one of my favorite films.The only serious con to the film: The plot was slow to start.  The heart-pounding action did not really kick in--and the two protagonists didn't even meet--until about 40 minutes into the film.  (I believe a movie should be well-grounded and moving within the first 20 minutes.)  But it is a difficult thing to tie The Bourne Legacy to the previous trilogy, and it was done really well, so I'm not overly bothered.  The scenes are quick and sharp, so at least the beginning isn't bogged down.  If you are looking for an action movie that is more than a simple plot with a lot of fistfights, then this is a fantastic pick.",4,Not Your Average Thriller,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",2013,1402,"['could', 'ever', 'say', 'loud', 'enough', 'fast', 'enough', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'afraid', 'finish', 'what', 'started', 'Aaron', 'CrossI', 'loved', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'levels', 'actors', 'sets', 'action', 'urgency', 'story', 'screenplay', 'was', 'excellent', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'characters', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'Marta', 'Shearing', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'straightforward', 'no-emotion', 'plot', 'out', 'be', 'nail-biting', 'thriller', 'cinematography', 'great', 'bringing', 'out', 'details', 'adding', 'depth', 'incredible', 'movie', 'beginning', 'was', 'startlingly', 'quick', 'real', 'rooftop/street', 'chase', 'was', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'best', 'chase', 'sequence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'yet', 'screen', 'ending', 'was', 'perfect', 'consider', 'one', 'favorite', 'films.The', 'only', 'serious', 'con', 'film', 'plot', 'was', 'slow', 'start', 'heart-pounding', 'action', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'kick', 'two', 'protagonists', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'meet', '40', 'minutes', 'film', 'believe', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'well-grounded', 'moving', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'difficult', 'thing', 'tie', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'previous', 'trilogy', 'was', 'done', 'really', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'bothered', 'scenes', 'are', 'quick', 'sharp', 'so', 'least', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'bogged', 'down', 'are', 'looking', 'action', 'movie', 'more', 'simple', 'plot', 'lot', 'fistfights', 'then', 'fantastic', 'pick']",N/A
1490321,AIO0Y6M8CLEKF,B005LAIIPS,MarkoSion,"[0, 0]","There were mixed reviews for this one, and its understandable after the Bourne series has reached iconic status in American film culture, and to re-work the series with a new turn can lead some viewers to ask for a U-turn.  Bourne has become the epitome of an understandable spy that we have grown to admire:  super-spy and car-chase finisher extraordinaire, yet with emotional empathy we can see how the consequences of his life go out of control.  We love the tale of his amnesiac state that moves forward to finally divide the moral blur that he has had to work under for several years as a Treadstone operative into reconciling his professional and psychological state.So when the Gilroy brothers decided to go with a new &#34;Bourne&#34;-like character, it would be a huge feat to keep the momentum going while retaining the fans for future installments.  They insert rising lead-role actor Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, another operative under a new program of operatives (called Outcome) who are enhanced through a regime of drug-treatments that enhance their physical and mental abilities.  When the events of The Bourne Ultimate (2007) break out, one of the heads of the program, Colonel Byer (Ed Norton), decides to shut down the entire thing, including implementing the morally disastrous decision to end the lives of the Outcome operatives who are serving their nation and unknowingly have no access what will happen to them.  Byer believes that the Bourne events will not only exploit the CIA's hidden deep cover programs, but theirs as well, so he seeks a complete &#34;burn to the ground&#34; of Outcome and re-build of it.Cross is targeted, as well as Dr. Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who is one of the main scientists in R&D; of the implementation of the drugs.  Cross goes on a Bourne-like hunt for Shearing as his body will have an eventual breakdown from the lack of medication (&#34;chems&#34;) as he is totally dependent on them for survival.I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a new direction in the Bourne series. I believe that many people were not as happy with the film was because, and rightfully so, it is a Bourne film, so we expect a similar themes, action, and drama that we saw in the first three.  However, as a standalone movie this movie brings something fresh to the table with a new intelligent twist in the spy genre- the implementation of super soldier status among field operatives.  What is the moral, emotional, and physical price of creating spies for the field who are deemed expendable?  Bourne was traversing Europe and America for his memories.  Cross becomes a new hero in his own right because he is left out in the cold by his former employers and is now racing against the clock to get his body and mind back.In terms of action, it is not original Bourne-like where there are frequent fight and car chase scenes.  But as a movie itself, it does a good job of using the similar themes of the Bourne franchise and going somewhere new with it.  It may not be for everyone, but it does a good job in my book nonetheless.",4,A New Legacy,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,3065,"['were', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'one', 'understandable', 'Bourne', 'series', 'reached', 'iconic', 'status', 'American', 'film', 'culture', 're-work', 'series', 'new', 'turn', 'can', 'lead', 'viewers', 'ask', 'U-turn', 'Bourne', 'become', 'epitome', 'understandable', 'spy', 'have', 'grown', 'admire', 'super-spy', 'car-chase', 'finisher', 'extraordinaire', 'yet', 'emotional', 'empathy', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'consequences', 'life', 'go', 'control', 'love', 'tale', 'amnesiac', 'state', 'forward', 'finally', 'divide', 'moral', 'blur', 'had', 'work', 'several', 'years', 'Treadstone', 'operative', 'reconciling', 'professional', 'psychological', 'state.So', 'when', 'Gilroy', 'brothers', 'decided', 'go', 'new', '34', 'Bourne', '34', '-like', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'huge', 'feat', 'keep', 'momentum', 'going', 'retaining', 'fans', 'future', 'installments', 'insert', 'rising', 'lead-role', 'actor', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'operative', 'new', 'program', 'operatives', 'called', 'Outcome', 'who', 'are', 'enhanced', 'regime', 'drug-treatments', 'enhance', 'physical', 'mental', 'abilities', 'When', 'events', 'Bourne', 'Ultimate', '2007', 'break', 'one', 'heads', 'program', 'Colonel', 'Byer', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'shut', 'down', 'entire', 'thing', 'including', 'implementing', 'morally', 'disastrous', 'decision', 'end', 'lives', 'Outcome', 'operatives', 'who', 'are', 'serving', 'nation', 'unknowingly', 'have', 'access', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Byer', 'Bourne', 'events', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'CIA', 'hidden', 'deep', 'cover', 'programs', 'as', 'well', 'complete', '34', 'burn', 'ground', '34', 'Outcome', 're-build', 'it.Cross', 'targeted', 'as', 'well', 'Dr.', 'Shearing', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'who', 'one', 'main', 'scientists', 'R', 'D', 'implementation', 'drugs', 'Cross', 'Bourne-like', 'hunt', 'Shearing', 'body', 'will', 'have', 'eventual', 'breakdown', 'lack', 'medication', '34', 'chems', '34', 'totally', 'dependent', 'survival.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'what', 'new', 'direction', 'Bourne', 'series', 'believe', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'was', 'because', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Bourne', 'film', 'expect', 'similar', 'themes', 'action', 'drama', 'saw', 'first', 'three', 'However', 'standalone', 'movie', 'movie', 'something', 'fresh', 'table', 'new', 'intelligent', 'twist', 'spy', 'genre-', 'implementation', 'super', 'soldier', 'status', 'field', 'operatives', 'What', 'moral', 'emotional', 'physical', 'price', 'creating', 'spies', 'field', 'who', 'are', 'deemed', 'expendable', 'Bourne', 'was', 'traversing', 'Europe', 'America', 'memories', 'Cross', 'new', 'hero', 'own', 'right', 'left', 'out', 'cold', 'former', 'employers', 'now', 'racing', 'clock', 'get', 'body', 'mind', 'back.In', 'terms', 'action', 'not', 'original', 'Bourne-like', 'where', 'are', 'frequent', 'fight', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'using', 'similar', 'themes', 'Bourne', 'franchise', 'going', 'somewhere', 'new', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'good', 'job', 'book', 'nonetheless']",N/A

He is referred to, and some of the events in the Bourne Ultimatum are tied into this movie, but this is a separate story.  I do think Jeremy Renner and (the ageless) Rachel Weisz perform well in their respective roles.  Weisz does a great job as a doctor who is somewhat naive about the consequences of her work.  Renner also does a good job as Cross and makes him different enough from Bourne that is does not just seem to be a total rehash of what we have already seen.  Edward Norton also does a good job as the government foil who is trying to hunt down Cross.As my title says, this movie expands the Bourne Universe beyond the operatives we already knew existed.  It certainly sets up the possibility of more movies including the possibility that Bourne and Cross will team up at some point.  You get the requisite balance of action and story as were in the other movies.  Like in the other movies it does slow down in the middle, but I did not find it was dragging too much for me.  You also get the trademark Bourne chase scene near the end of the movie.  This time a motorcycle chase through Manilla.Ultimately, if you enjoyed the other movies (as long as you are not one of those who cannot see anyone other than Damon in the lead role) you will probably find this one enjoyable as well.  While there are elements from the other movies (and even continues the story line from the Bourne Ultimatum at the end) it does for the most part stand on its own.

It turned out to be nicely presented.This Bourne refresh does a fine job of living up to its legacy partly through the acting abilities of Jeremy Renner who does a great job of playing the guy who can emotionally disarm people and/or even calm them down, as well as through the acting abilities of Ed Norton, who  plays the main antagonist trying to shut down a special operation gone bad. Norton's character keeps the pace moving when we are not focused on Renner's ""adventures"" in the film.It's a fun, sometimes introspective cat and mouse picture that spans all over the globe with some definitive focuses in various parts of Asia which felt like a fresh enough touch.Action scenes are creative enough and the story is pretty good for its plotting and payoffs (look for the gold watch he gets off the Aussie and then changes wrists at the end) rather than its overall idea. That's probably a good thing as the really good ideas of Hollywood are sometimes poorly executed. Stringing the various elements together is much harder to pull off.It's hard to talk about the story without giving things away so I won't say much of anything. That said, if you want spoilers read below. The trailer talked about DNA and genetic manipulations so you should go in without any general surprises in that area.Ed Norton's character, one of the distant antagonists, had the best metaphorical dialogue. It also starred a number of known names which included: Albert Finney, an older Rachel Weisz and Joan Allen.The budget for this film was $130M and after only several days it has already made a bit over $88M at the Box Office. Impressive by Box Office standards but don't expect it to get Best Picture.The Jason Bourne character incidentally was created by novelist Robert Ludlum though this particular move title was based on a novel by Eric Van Lustbader. The movies deviate greatly from the actual novels.There are number of homages to the movie trilogy especially in the music. Notice the ending song by Moby.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; ACTION SCENES: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012 (at the movies); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.SPOILERS: I liked the idea with the pills and how the special ops needed them to survive (though this is by no means a super original idea). The ending finale had a good enough action scene in which the female lead got to control how things would go down versus the enemy special ops dude. Obviously, these special ops were all modified. I liked how the enemy special ops actually stopped to sniff for the main character and then tracked him on scent.I suppose I will always know Rachel Weisz from the first two ""Mummy"" movies of the trilogy with Brendan Fraser so that look has stuck with me. I didn't recognize her until the credits rolled.

1490333,A3G4MPMSA9T3HK,B005LAIIPS,M. Mierendorf,"[0, 0]","Given the commercial and critical success of The Bourne Trilogy, doing a relaunch of the series was a no-brainer. Whether the character of Jason Bourne could/would continue without Matt Damon was the big question. When The Bourne Legacy was announced, there were questions of whether the story would follow the plot of the novel. Starring Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, it bares no resemblance to the novel other than the title.Renner does a nice job as Cross. He's a believable trained assassin and action star thanks to his successful roles in The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and most recently, The Avengers. He's methodical, smart, lethal, and very athletic--almost unnaturally so. The film's plot runs parallel to The Bourne Ultimatum. The aftermath of Bourne's actions in New York are causing collateral damage and Col. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is leading the clean-up efforts. He's as secretive as possible and his government/spy lingo is just as elusive to the audience. Filled with acronyms, code words, and projects, without having seen the first three Bourne movies (particularlyThe Bourne Ultimatum), you're likely to be completely lost.The clean-up efforts include eliminating the remaining operatives in the field, one of which is Cross. The story jumps between the spy overlords in Washington and Cross trying to find more of the medicine prescribed in his program. It's here that we're introduced to Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz). Dr. Shearing and her team run the medical side of the program (although they're not entirely clear as to what they've been doing). They work to create behavioral modification in the form of a pill, as well as to develop physical improvements on the genetic and neurological level for the operatives.Through a series of violent events, Dr. Shearing and Cross's paths meet. Promising to help Cross in his search for the medicine, their story advances while Byer works to eliminate both of them. There are some very exciting action scenes, including one of the longest chase scenes in recent memory, lasting over fifteen minutes. Director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, Duplicity) also wrote the screenplay, as well as the previous three Bourne screenplays, so the language of the film is the same. Where the film suffers is the pacing and story structure. The continuous cutting between the Bourne clean-up in Washington and Cross's early exploits slows down the pacing. The film feels disjointed at times and the events in Washington D.C. don't feel as urgent and detrimental to the secrecy of the program as the characters would suggest.The biggest flaw of the film is the lack of resolution to any of the story-lines. Gilroy must be under strict instructions from Universal to continue the Bourne series in a new trilogy. Everything is left open, ambiguous, or unanswered for the inevitable sequels. In the recent age of turning stories into film trilogies or more to increase profits (i.e. The Hobbit, The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Twilight), Universal and Gilroy have apparently created only one-third of a story. Without the sequels, The Bourne Legacy doesn't feel like a complete film. Despite coherently-directed action sequences and a good script that is well-acted, it's difficult for the film to stand on its own. Where as the first three Bourne films can all be viewed independently of each other, The Bourne Legacy is merely the first piece of a project that's years away from completion.",3,A New Chapter In An Incomplete Story,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",2013,3471,"['Given', 'commercial', 'critical', 'success', 'Bourne', 'Trilogy', 'doing', 'relaunch', 'series', 'was', 'no-brainer', 'character', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'could/would', 'continue', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'was', 'big', 'question', 'When', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'was', 'announced', 'were', 'questions', 'story', 'would', 'follow', 'plot', 'novel', 'Starring', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'resemblance', 'novel', 'other', 'title.Renner', 'nice', 'job', 'Cross', 'believable', 'trained', 'assassin', 'action', 'star', 'thanks', 'successful', 'roles', 'Hurt', 'Locker', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'Ghost', 'Protocol', 'most', 'recently', 'Avengers', 'methodical', 'smart', 'lethal', 'very', 'athletic', 'almost', 'unnaturally', 'so', 'film', 'plot', 'parallel', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'aftermath', 'Bourne', 'actions', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'causing', 'collateral', 'damage', 'Col.', 'Eric', 'Byer', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'leading', 'clean-up', 'efforts', 'as', 'secretive', 'possible', 'government/spy', 'lingo', 'just', 'as', 'elusive', 'audience', 'Filled', 'acronyms', 'code', 'words', 'projects', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'three', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'particularlyThe', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', ""'re"", 'likely', 'be', 'completely', 'lost.The', 'clean-up', 'efforts', 'include', 'eliminating', 'remaining', 'operatives', 'field', 'one', 'Cross', 'story', 'jumps', 'spy', 'overlords', 'Washington', 'Cross', 'trying', 'find', 'more', 'medicine', 'prescribed', 'program', 'here', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Dr.', 'Marta', 'Shearing', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Dr.', 'Shearing', 'team', 'run', 'medical', 'side', 'program', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'clear', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'work', 'create', 'behavioral', 'modification', 'form', 'pill', 'as', 'well', 'develop', 'physical', 'improvements', 'genetic', 'neurological', 'level', 'operatives.Through', 'series', 'violent', 'events', 'Dr.', 'Shearing', 'Cross', 'paths', 'meet', 'Promising', 'help', 'Cross', 'search', 'medicine', 'story', 'advances', 'Byer', 'eliminate', 'are', 'very', 'exciting', 'action', 'scenes', 'including', 'one', 'longest', 'chase', 'scenes', 'recent', 'memory', 'lasting', 'over', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Director', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'Michael', 'Clayton', 'Duplicity', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'previous', 'three', 'Bourne', 'screenplays', 'language', 'film', 'same', 'Where', 'film', 'suffers', 'pacing', 'story', 'structure', 'continuous', 'cutting', 'Bourne', 'clean-up', 'Washington', 'Cross', 'early', 'exploits', 'down', 'pacing', 'film', 'feels', 'disjointed', 'times', 'events', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'urgent', 'detrimental', 'secrecy', 'program', 'characters', 'would', 'suggest.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'film', 'lack', 'resolution', 'story-lines', 'Gilroy', 'must', 'be', 'strict', 'instructions', 'Universal', 'continue', 'Bourne', 'series', 'new', 'trilogy', 'Everything', 'left', 'open', 'ambiguous', 'unanswered', 'inevitable', 'sequels', 'recent', 'age', 'turning', 'stories', 'film', 'trilogies', 'more', 'increase', 'profits', 'i.e', 'Hobbit', 'Hunger', 'Games', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Twilight', 'Universal', 'Gilroy', 'have', 'apparently', 'created', 'only', 'one-third', 'story', 'sequels', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', ""n't"", 'feel', 'complete', 'film', 'coherently-directed', 'action', 'sequences', 'good', 'script', 'well-acted', 'difficult', 'film', 'stand', 'own', 'Where', 'first', 'three', 'Bourne', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'independently', 'other', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'merely', 'first', 'piece', 'project', 'years', 'away', 'completion']",N/A

Very few yet meaningful eye movements and facial expressions conveyed the deep sense that most of the actors lived their roles with great conviction. For example, close the end of the movie, the main female character and genetic doctor showed impressive appeal for help to a Philippino resident in impressively realistic manner that spontaneously touches the reviewers with her dilemma.On the government side, great choices of diverse characters conveyed realistic sense of how the heavy hands of the government are left to few individuals under the banner of protecting this nation.The 130 minute movie spanned the globe, from Alaska, Washington DC, New York, and Philippine. In each location, the best geographic scenarios were emphasized, showing the obsession of the moviemaker with the beauty of nature. The Alaskan landscape started the film with impressive views on the glorious topology of Alaskan snow mountains. Close to the end, the greatest beauty of Philippine's oceanic scenery filled the screen with astonishing natural marvels.The main theme of genetic behavior design through viral manipulation of chromosome was delivered with great oratorical display and graphical illustration that far exceed many alternative source of education.My only take on the movie is its improper title, when the movie dealt with governmental concealment of serious and disastrous scientific experiments and the heavy hands of a government empowered by unprecedented power of oppressing people, violating the privacy of its citizens, in addition to the scientific issue of using viral attachments to target spotted genetic maps, while the title emphasized personal preference.Mohamed F.

1490336,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B005LAIIPS,M. Oleson,"[2, 3]","After seeing this movie, I took a peek at several professionally written reviews.  Some of the criticism was that the movie was loud with too much action.  Others said it was too wordy or dialog driven and short on thrills.  For me it was just about perfect.  Another criticism is that the studio is milking the 3 Matt Damon led predecessors.  Of course that's true but so what?  The Bourne franchise has plenty left, so let's just go with it.Helmed this time by Tony Gilroy (""Michael Clayton"") who was a screenwriter for the previous Bourne's, the film does start slow and without much explanation.  Our new hero is secret agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner, ""The Avengers""), who like Jason Bourne is a military/CIA medical experiment.  He is in the snowy mountains of Alaska (actually shot in Iceland) on a survival training mission, but is running low on pills (""chems"") he needs to survive.  He doesn't know that he and a small group like him are being eliminated as a super duper secret layer of the American intelligence network is about to be outed by Bourne (never seen) and his boss from the previous film, Pam Landy (Joan Allen, briefly).The new boss man is Eric Byer (Edward Norton) who pulls out all the stops to get Cross, the last of his class of spies.  I've given up trying to filter through the various government spy agencies.  If you think the CIA is it, think again.  There are secret levels and layers that I don't think anyone can keep count of.  And forget about trying to understand the medical/genetic/viral mumbo jumbo.  Just understand that Bourne needs ""chems"" or a variant to survive.  Aiding him in his quest and escape is his government provided doctor (Rachel Weisz doing a fine American accent) who's also on the run.Once the action begins it rarely lets up.  Unlike the Bourne films where close combat is one of the tent poles, ""Legacy"" relies more upon the Parkour style of running across rooftops of slums for some of the action.  We've seen this in too many films.  Enough already.  Having said that, the film enjoys some excellent action sequences that slow down just enough to allow everyone to catch their breath and calculate the next move.  More Bourne?

I stopped being entertained at that point and was soberly reminded of recent shootings all over the country very similar to the one portrayed in the movie. The rest of the movie was enjoyable and I laughed at how unstoppable the really stylish bad guy at the end was. Overall, I enjoyed the theatrical experience other than that one scene that took me out of it. Having stewed on it for a few months, I came to admire the boldness of the inclusion of that scene. I was moved by the fact that because of recent events and the plausibility of a shooting like the one in the movie it was included. It just made the story more believable. So while that scene is still hard to watch, I can respectfully admire the point it is trying to get across. As far as the Blu-ray is concerned, the audio was a blast to listen to. I love it when normal scenes take advantage of surround sound in addition to the action scenes. I felt completely immersed in the movie. The picture quality was great and the film grain was intact the whole time. As far as the extras are concerned, I watched every last bit of them. The audio commentary was worth a listen, but I won't be returning to it any time soon. The participants talked over each other a lot and also alluded to a lot of personal anecdotes without really going into what they meant. But, it was also really informative on certain scenes, especially the scene at Marta's house. I found about half of the commentary very interesting and the other half was nonsense. The rest of the special features were great, their only downfall being that there are not more of them. That said, the best buy exclusive disc did not have anything that compelled me to get that version. It seemed like mostly fluff stuff. So if anyone has that version, they should post what they think of the exclusive content. Overall, worth the purchase. It holds up well to repeat viewings and the Blu-ray is top notch. Make sure and watch the deleted scenes, they add some nice flavor. As far as PG-13 content goes, this movie earned it for a bunch of violence and some language. I would preview it before showing it to younger kids, due to the disturbing nature of a few of the scenes (what the people try to do to Marta at her house, and the laboratory shooting in particular).

Personally, I am sick and tired of ""loner"" movies; sick and tired of the lone husband or lone wife whom we're supposed to empathize with in his or her quest for revenge. What we get for our empathy are lots of special effects, CGI, high body counts and the tiresome one-liners, with the hero or heroine as unfulfilled when the movie is over as he or she was when it began.Give me a Neo and Trinity pairing any day (The Matrix); a movie where the man and woman need each other to survive and have that special mixture of chemistry between them to make them overwhelmingly watchable. Hence, Renner and Weisz are what I loved best about this movie.  They were so natural together. They were two people working together against all the adversaries in this story, for one simple goal: helping each other to stay alive.I also enjoyed the science that created the bionic men and women, the scenes in Alaska and in Manila, especially when Weisz had to look after Renner.

1490375,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B005LAIIPS,Robert J. Crawford,"[1, 1]","I didn't have very high hopes for this film, but I was curious what they would do to go beyond the absolute perfection of the Bourne trilogy.  The Damon film, which we must contrast to this offshoot, balanced many factors:  Bourne was vulnerable but an expert killer (i.e. realistic), the shadowy CIA/NSA group was believable and timely, and the principal character's plight and search were compelling.  Unfortunately, the Bourne Legacy doesn't quite succeed at any of these.  I will attempt to go into the reasons for this without revealing plot spoilers.First, pumped up by some kind of magical meds, the new character is more like a superhero.  His abilities and even his intelligence are enhanced by biotech.  In other words, we are almost if not quite in Spiderman territory.  So the good guys are better, the baddies badder.  Second, in its attempt to deepen the conspiracy, we learn that there is another group, never defined and perhaps more deeply entrenched, that is masterminding the new efforts.  It includes scientists, military types, and some kind of ominous organization that even Ezra kowtows to.  While the film is skillfully interwoven with events that were seen in the trilogy, advancing the story of Landy and her enemies, the new group feels grafted on.  Third, the principal characters - played by Renner and Weisz - lack the tightness of focus that Bourne had in his need to overcome his amnesia and discover the mystery behind his conditioning.  Taken together, I simply couldn't quite suspend my disbelief.Finally, there are many holes in the film's plot - the viewer doesn't know how characters figure out certain things, e.g. when Aaron springs up in Dr. Shearing's house to save her in the knick of time.  How did the new conspirators find the couple in the Philippines?  WHere do they get their money?  Why would Shearing throw herself in with Aaron?  Presumably, some of this may be explained in subsequent films, but the effect is to lessen the film's believability further.That leaves the viewer with the tried-and-true situation room, where a team tracks our heros as they elude everything they throw at them, and then there are chases and good fights.  And the minute you see Weisz, you know she is going to be a love interest of some sort.  Of course, Aaron will almost certainly ""bring the fight to your doorstep"" in sequels.  It has the feel of a formula film, another mega-franchise.Oddly, it works best if you separate this offshoot from the original trilogy in your mind.  Viewed that way, it is pretty fun action/scifi.

Renner plays a great and gritty super-agent and he fits the role perfectly to me. The blu-ray quality is very good. I wish it wasn't shown in letterbox, but that's a small gripe. It also doesn't have that many special features. Me personally...I was hoping for a more indepth Bourne review, so those who aren't familiar with the first three movies could get a recap. As it is, if you haven't seen the first three films I think you will be completely lost. It also makes it a bit complicated because Bourne Legacy is taking place at the same time as Bourne Ultimatum, which is the film previous to this Bourne installment. I have seen the first three films and I had to rewatch them because it was very complicated to follow the story in Bourne Legacy. You get the general gist that Renner is trying to get his super soldier drugs, but there is a lot going on that is more subtext and winks to the previous films. If you haven't seen them or you don't remember them then it's probably a good idea to catch up on them. Overall, this was a good movie and I would ignore the haters who want to find fault with it. The super-soldier part is very believable in the context of the film and it adds some intensity to Renner's chracter. Rachel Weisz is also very good and I don't mind that she just stands around waiting for Renner to save her. She's not the action star here and I liked the chemistry between them.

It gave me the same thrill and satisfaction as the previous installments did, which are essentially good espionage conspiracy plots well packaged with great actions and high paced cinematograhy. As a professional businessman, I love it even more. With Damon's refusal to act as Bourne for a fourth time and under the pressure from Universal to take advantage of previous successes worldwide, I am obliged to praise the superb intelligence and skill of the screenwriter turned director Tony Gilroy (he wrote for all three previous ones) for the completion of such a high quality action movie leveraging on storylines of Ultimatium yet without compromsing the overall style and structure, whilst maintaining the upside in case Damon agrees to return or Renner is accepted in his new hero role as Aaron Cross. Certainly the outstanding acting of Weisz and Norton had added much value and attraction as well. Whilst many reviewers criticized that the two Oscar grade star actor and actress should not have taken part in this overstretched extension, I applaud their wisdom to appreciate the potential of it. IMHO, the final product and the updated worldwide boxoffice $276M (vs a $125M budget) had proved them right though it's still far below the $443M of Ultimatum.

Liked the actors playing the leads, all the acting was good.  Thought the writers structured the story well enough, had enough action/fight sequences, and were strong in writing an engaging male character, not so good with the female lead - I thought she should have been quicker on the uptake, considering she was a highly educated doctor and scientist and knew she was testing spies, and working for the government.  I thought the lead male character yelling at her after he found out he'd been administered drugs that made continuing to take some of the pills unnecessary, rich, considering he did similar type of work, basically being told what to do by the government just as the doctor was, and doing it, but not liking it when it was done to him.  I thought the Rachael Weisz character ran unusually, as if she was an olympic sprinter, rather than a doctor.  Hard to get emotionally into these films, as the leads (the spy characters) are trained killers and kill their way through the movies.  I thought the portrayal of the fictitious government agency willing to turn on a dime against it's citizens was chilling (as they did with the doctors/scientists/spies working for them).  I would watch a sequel with these actors, and I'll probably eventually buy the movie (checked it out from the library this time), so I liked it well enough, though I tend not to like quick editing so much, and alot of camera movement, and these are used several places in this movie.  Sometimes the images move so fast and are edited so fast I can't keep up.  I also am not a big fan of the music used, especially when basic, ordinary work is being done in an office setting, and action music is played along side - I find hyper music played against ordinary images distracting, but that is done in Bourne movies.  I wouldn't go to a theater to see these films; I never have.  But as I said I'll probably buy this one eventually, as I bought at least one of the earlier films.  I like Matt Damon but I thought the actor playing Aaron was good too, he's basically written very similarly to Jason Bourne, kind of a spy with a heart of gold (to the woman in his life).

1490408,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B005LAIIPS,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[1, 1]","I saw The Bourne Identity in the theater, along with every other film made in the series. You might be inclined to think at this point the franchise has run out of gas, as the novels have been exhausted and old events are being retread. At first I thought that too. But I gave this film a chance and I'm very glad I did.There IS NO PLOTIf you've seen the other Bourne films you pretty much already know everything (or hopefully guessed it by now). Then again, perhaps like me you went through the evolution of &#34;Treadstone? Black Brier? Why DID that guy jump out the window? What's the point of all this? Ahh...never mind. I'm going sit back and enjoy the chases and action.&#34; In any case, you needn't worry about the plot, because there isn't one.You demand to know the excuse for a plot? Okay. The cancelled super-agent programs are resulting in &#34;clean-up&#34; where loose ends are tied up and shot through the head. Our two likable protagonists played by the always charming Jeremy Renner and always gorgeous Rachel Weisz are hunted down by the always cool Edward Norton and his intelligence network. There. That's it.Characters?It is really nice to see Jeremy Renner get a starring role, even if the studio execs thought it was a throw-away. He was enormously likable in Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (giving the impression of super-spy meets Brendan Fraser in one handsome friendly package), and I was ready for him to play hero. Here his character (like Matt Damon's Bourne) says almost nothing about his past, yet we come to feel we know him. He's a very friendly guy. Perhaps too friendly for his profession. He's also very, very skilled. And in snippets we come to understand where he came from, and it lends sympathy to his predicament.The scientist played by Rachel Weisz could have been a cookie-cutter damsel and instead was played as a real human being thrust into an impossible situation with a super-spy and an army of trained killers after her. NIcely done. Edward Norton has a smaller part in this film, but nonetheless proves about to anchor things with cold intelligence previously portrayed by much older actors.EntertainmentBut let's be honest. The REAL star of this film is the camerawork, music, and cinematography. The roller-coaster ride that ensues once the kill-order goes through. And yes, THAT star is in fine form.Bourne Identity reinvented the action film, but this film is a more enjoyable movie (to me anyway). There's some actual cinematography instead of shaky-cam. There's some beautiful good-old-fashioned-hollywood-film-making. And the film is better for it. The inevitable chase scene might not blow your mind like the one from Bourne Identity, and you're not going to see any agent vs. agent hand-to-hand insanity, but overall this film is less of a downer, and more of a film you can sit down, watch and just enjoy.Oh don't get me wrong, there's a brutual execution of scientists who have outlived their usefulness, and plenty of other fights to be seen, there just isn't the same level of stabbed-through-the-hand-with-a-pen and strangled-to-death grittiness that pervades the other Bourne films. If you LIKED those scenes you may find this one tame by comparison. Personally I find it less stressful and more enjoyable. Mileage may vary.My FavAs I get older, I find myself enjoying films that are more light-hearted and just plain old fun to watch, as opposed to films that are great, but not very enjoyable. This film is on my shelf next to Men In Black 3, Mission Impossible 4, Tron Legacy, John Carter, and Prince of Persia. Yeah, to me at least, it's THAT kind of movie.

The novels were completely perverted in the scripts when they killed off Marie in The Bourne Supremacy. She was such an integral part of the life of the Jason Bourne character of the novels that I was totally flabbergasted at the screw-ups with the scripts.Then there were Matt Damon and Franka Potente, neither of whom came even close to being the Jason and Marie of the novels. Nothing against Damon and Potente per se; they just didn't fit. Period.And then came Jeremy Brenner and Rachel Weisz and it was like ""WOW! They did something right for once."" Maybe the plots weren't even close to anything Ludlum, but the characters certainly were much, much more like the Jason and Marie I recall from the novels. And characters are, after all, at the heart of everything.Plus, of course, the awfully pretentious and thoroughly nauseating Greengrass cinematography was gone, and so we ended up with a truly enjoyable flick.And, no, I definitely do NOT want to see a movie where Damon joins Brenner.

1490419,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B005LAIIPS,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[83, 118]","(Note: I will update this when I get the Blu-ray).The Bourne movie franchise has made quite the name for itself. In the hands of Doug Liman, he not only managed to introduce an interesting character with a lot of mystery and intrigue to his background, but also a character we were able to sympathize for. He was a character that lost his memory, re-discovered himself, then tried to leave his dark past behind and escape a corrupt system. After Paul Greengrass took the reigns, he improved what Liman left on the table, further exposing the humanistic side of this character as we see him lose the part of his life he cares about the most. But despite that loss, his humanity would prove to be stronger than his vengeance, as even more memories start to surface, making his journey for revenge turn into a search for redemption. And after finding his inner peace, he takes pursuit of those responsible in an effort to destroy the very system that had created him and brought about so much pain and suffering, not only to him, but many of those involved throughout its history. At this point, I think it's safe to say that Matt Damon's portrayal of Jason Bourne has really cemented itself amongst the iconic spy heroes (next to James Bond and maybe Bryan Mills from Taken). Actually, for a while Universal Studios had been negotiating another Bourne movie with Damon, but he said he'd only take the role if Greengrass was directing. The two of them had signed on for something, at the very least, but things never fell through for another sequel, and the tandem would go on to make Green Zone (a pretty engaging military conspiracy thriller in itself, but that's for another review).Instead of Damon and Greengrass doing another Jason Bourne entry, we have something of a spinoff. The Bourne Legacy was written by Eric Van Lustbader and merely inspired by Robert Ludlum's work, so I guess you can't say there's really a ""direct"" correlation in terms of source material deviation. On the other hand, this new entry was written and directed by Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for the first 3 films, wrote/directed Michael Clayton, and wrote the story for State of Play (both being excellent thrillers in their own right). He also wrote/directed Duplicity, which I guess could technically fall under the thriller genre, but the romantic comedy elements made it feel like something else entirely. So how did Gilroy's third directing project go?The story begins in the snowy mountains of Alaska where Outcome agent Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is undergoing survival training. Meanwhile, news of Blackbriar's demise and the controversy surrounding it have forced Outcome's director Eric Byer (Edward Norton) into action after evidence had surfaced linking the founders of both Treadstone/Blackbriar and Outcome together. In an effort to stop this trail from leading back to them, Byer decides to shut the program down and burn it to the ground, eliminating any and all personnel involved. When a scientist for the program, Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), witnesses the murder of her colleagues, she and Cross become the remaining loose ends and must survive on the run to discover the answers behind the conspiracy.My favorite thing about the movie is its maintaining of realism. Just like how cool it was for Bourne to escape every situation by a hair's breadth or for him to set up the ultimate of break-ins and steal something vital, I'd say this was about as realistic as what was shown in Greengrass' films. Not ""realistic"" in the sense of believability, per se, but in the sense of how things could work out. The element of improvisation is still there in Cross, and while his end results may not be as flashy as when Bourne is outsmarting or outwitting an entire task force, many of Cross' scenes are still entertaining to watch. And a lot of it has to do with Renner's performance. The character he portrays isn't nearly as mysterious as Damon's originally was, but it's a very likeable one. This is only the 4th movie I've ever seen him in (the others being The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and The Avengers), but it's really the only other starring role I've seen him do, and I think he does a great job. He has a good amount of charisma and enough ferocity in his action sequences to be revered and feared, and depending on where they go after this, I hope he really gets a chance to shine like Damon did as Bourne.I also love that they got Edward Norton to play the antagonist. He's a brilliant actor to begin with, and to see him as something of a villain was a real treat. He's always had a natural ability to take command on screen, and his role as Byer is no exception. Pretty much any time he's talking, it's hard not to pay attention to him, even if the other characters on screen with him are of a higher rank. His performance feels very intelligent and shadowy enough, but I was hoping the story would've allowed for him to show a meaner side every now and then. It's a very convincing role, and again, if they end up making a sequel I would love for him to return and hope that they write even more opportunities for him to become a well-developed character.And finally, I thought the scientific approach to the black ops program was a nice touch. Jason Bourne was more about the personal side of a cold-blooded assassin re-discovering his humanity and atoning for all the people he killed, which, symbolically, makes for great cinema. But the explanation on how he became so skilled in everything was just a given. We're to assume he's just good at what he does, and that's that. Here, the capabilities of an agent are, perhaps, less cool to think about in terms of ""yeah, he kicks ass,"" just because he can. Aaron Cross seems more like he has the knowledge of things, but the lack of extreme force makes the overall tone of everything he does seem more down-to-earth. Although, I guess a lot of it has to do with the cinematography and editing as well (most of the trademark Greengrass shaky-cam is gone this time around). All in all, it feels nice to know where some of these talents and skills are coming from.Now on to the actual movie. It's slow, but fast. I know that's a weird way to describe it, but it really is. When I say ""slow,"" I mean the pacing is at about the same speed as The Bourne Identity. Throughout the film, you're given pieces of the plot, the occasional flashback to fill in some of the gaps or to develop Cross, and it all slowly builds towards a climax. And when I say ""fast,"" I mean that I was so engrossed in trying to fit the pieces together, by the time I knew it, the movie was over. It's odd that for barely over 2 hours I was really wanting to know more about Cross' and Byer's pasts, what the true scope and reach of the genetic engineering project was, and just how many of these black ops programs really existed. And then there was this big chase sequence at the end, and it was done. I will say that if you go into this expecting a similar style to Identity, you'll be disappointed. The amnesia thing for Bourne was unique and his working backwards to find the truth was even more so. It was a plot of mystery and intrigue that was kind of pre-established already and Bourne just had to pick up the pieces. That's not the case here with Cross.As a character, the flashbacks work as a device to build him, slowly and thoroughly, but he already knows who he is. I firmly believe that if this film is financially successful enough that they'll continue to try and develop his character forwards, instead of backwards. I think that if they're smart enough to write a good story arc for his character, they'll include more and more flashbacks working their way up to a realization of what he can or does become. And to achieve this, I'm a little on the fence about the inclusion of Shearing. As talented as Weisz is, her character felt a tad over-reactive and panicky at times, which added a little too much of a ""damsel in distress"" quality to the rest of the film (i.e. makes her look weak). I suppose it makes sense to mimic the male-female coupling for the search of truth so they can rely on one-another. But like Franka Potente said about playing Marie, her character wasn't as clich&eacute; and the chemistry between Bourne and her was purposely sporadic. I just hope the relationship between Cross and Shearing doesn't become too melodramatic at some point. Then again, they could always kill her, too.Picture-wise, I saw this on a digital projector at my local Cinemark. The movie itself was shot on 35mm and processed digitally and looks pretty spectacular. As much as I loved the documentary shaky-cam aesthetic Greengrass employed in his films, the one drawback to it was that the picture never really stayed still long enough for you to just look at something in a still frame and enjoy it, aside from the occasional scenic overhead shot of a city that lasted for all but 2 or 3 seconds until it zoomed in and cut to the next shaky shot. Here, Robert Elswit's photography has a much wider lens view, and yes, more static shots. Elswit also worked on Mission Impossible 4, which also starred Renner, ironically, and I think that may have influenced the wider shots after working with the IMAX cameras for that one. In terms of editing, the task is performed by Tony's brother John, and is also a lot less kinetic. Closeup shots are used about as much as they had been in the other Bourne films since the dialogue is so important, but I like that even without the quick cuts during action sequences, it sacrifices intensity for appreciation of the actual choreography. For the stunts, they brought back Dan Bradley who directed all the stunt work in the previous films, and the fights were coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio who was an assistant in the fights of Ultimatum and the lead choreographer for Haywire (really love the fights in that movie).Music-wise, James Newton Howard takes over for John Powell. I will stress that I absolutely loved Powell's work for the first 3 movies and that Bourne's main theme and the pulsating drums of his action pieces are one of the best sounds I've heard for any action movie outside of Hans Zimmer. Howard doesn't quite capture the same essence, but again, this is a completely different cast of characters. Thematically, he does manage to sneak in a little bit of Bourne's theme into some of his pieces, but only faintly and probably as a reminder that this movie is part of the franchise. The overall sound, however, is a lot more contemporary and even has some electric guitar in it. The more upbeat percussionist pieces used for the action sequences also carry a similar beat akin to Powell's, though are a little more variant with other instruments around it. In listening to the soundtrack, there doesn't seem to be a central theme or motif within any one piece to represent Cross' character, which is a little disappointing. As a whole, though, the score makes for great ambiance. And hopefully, if any sequels are made and become more action-packed, Howard will reach into his bag for some more up-tempo tricks.Overall, my expectations weren't set too high, but I was pleasantly surprised at this new character. The story has less mystery and intrigue, but instead a more linear approach to it, with Jason Bourne only being a reference point. The ""Legacy"" is more so about the super-soldier learning to think for himself and bailing a corrupted system as per Bourne's example. Even Greengrass stated in his commentaries that the villains weren't really bad guys, they were just part of a bad system. And with the potential to take the franchise in, hopefully, a newer, even fresher direction with Aaron Cross, something will come of it, be it Gilroy returning to write, direct, or whatever. Nowhere left to go now, but forward.Overall: 3.5 / 5.0",4,The Bourne Legacy (Theatrical),1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,11884,"['Note', 'will', 'update', 'when', 'get', 'Blu-ray', 'Bourne', 'movie',

1490425,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIIPS,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","The new installment of the ""Bourne"" franchise stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross, an ""Operation Outcome"" agent, and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Marta Shearing responsible for his medical check-ups. The filmmakers of ""The Bourne Legacy"" should thank their luck that they were able to have these gifted players, for without them, ""The Bourne Legacy"" would have been a total mess.The storyline of ""Legacy"" itself is not complicated. Now that some of the CIA's top secrets are publicly exposed, Edward Norton's character Eric Byer is hired to erase all the evidences that would lead to further investigation. ""The Bourne legacy"" is not about Jason Bourne, but a chain of events that was triggered by his action seen in ""Ultimatum.""However, despite several fine action sequences, ""Legacy"" tends to be tedious, taking so much time trying to explain everything. Locations are interesting, and Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz are both impressive, but the film lacks suspense, suffering from the heavy-handed narrative. Also, the character of Aaron Cross is not very interesting, lacking the complexity that Jason Bourne is allowed to have.To make a new Bourne film means to give a new story and characters to the audiences who have enjoyed the Jason Bourne story arc. Tony Gilroy (screenwriter of the three previous Bourne films) is in charge of this difficult job of expanding the trilogy's universe. To do so, he not only employed ideas like brainwashing and chemicals; the new director called back some of the franchise's supporting players including Joan Allen, Albert Finney and Scott Glenn. Neither of them works. The scientific elements are pretentious and clich&eacute;d while, as to the presence of these veteran actors, they only help remind us of the merits of ""Ultimatum,"" which knew how to entertain the viewers.After all, what is the point of making another ""Bourne"" movie when Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is not coming back? In spite of the electrifying acting from Jeremy Renner, ""The Bourne Legacy"" will not answer that question. Perhaps things would have been better with someone as director, who remembers the Bourne trilogy was first and foremost made for entertainment. As it is, ""Legacy"" remains a so-so action movie with A-list actors.",3,(2.5 STARS) See for the Stars Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",2012,2239,"['new', 'installment', 'Bourne', 'franchise', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'Operation', 'Outcome', 'agent', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Dr.', 'Marta', 'Shearing', 'responsible', 'medical', 'check-ups', 'filmmakers', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'should', 'thank', 'luck', 'were', 'able', 'have', 'gifted', 'players', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'total', 'mess.The', 'storyline', 'Legacy', 'not', 'complicated', 'Now', 'CIA', 'top', 'secrets', 'are', 'publicly', 'exposed', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'character', 'Eric', 'Byer', 'hired', 'erase', 'evidences', 'would', 'lead', 'further', 'investigation', 'Bourne', 'legacy', 'not', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'chain', 'events', 'was', 'triggered', 'action', 'seen', 'Ultimatum', 'However', 'several', 'fine', 'action', 'sequences', 'Legacy', 'be', 'tedious', 'taking', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'trying', 'explain', 'everything', 'Locations', 'are', 'interesting', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'are', 'impressive', 'film', 'suspense', 'suffering', 'heavy-handed', 'narrative', 'Also', 'character', 'Aaron', 'Cross', 'not', 'very', 'interesting', 'lacking', 'complexity', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'allowed', 'have.To', 'make', 'new', 'Bourne', 'film', 'means', 'give', 'new', 'story', 'characters', 'audiences', 'who', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'story', 'arc', 'Tony', 'Gilroy', 'screenwriter', 'three', 'previous', 'Bourne', 'films', 'charge', 'difficult', 'job', 'expanding', 'trilogy', 'universe', 'do', 'so', 'not', 'only', 'employed', 'ideas', 'brainwashing', 'chemicals', 'new', 'director', 'called', 'back', 'franchise', 'supporting', 'players', 'including', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Scott', 'Glenn', 'Neither', 'scientific', 'elements', 'are', 'pretentious', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'while', 'presence', 'veteran', 'actors', 'only', 'help', 'remind', 'merits', 'Ultimatum', 'knew', 'how', 'entertain', 'viewers.After', 'what', 'point', 'making', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'when', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'not', 'coming', 'back', 'spite', 'electrifying', 'acting', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'Bourne', 'Legacy', 'will', 'not', 'answer', 'question', 'Perhaps', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'someone', 'director', 'who', 'Bourne', 'trilogy', 'was', 'first', 'foremost', 'made', 'entertainment', 'Legacy', 'so-so', 'action', 'movie', 'A-list', 'actors']",N/A

It opens up a whole new world to the Bourne universe and and turns this Bourne Identity thing into a franchise like Bond. Jeremy Renner is excellent and his hand to hand combat skills make Matt Damon look like a boy scout. I had no idea that these guys were genetically enhanced and not just trained to be elite assassins. I would love to see Damon and Renner together in the next Bourne movie trying to shut down the operation that wants to shutthem down. But if they do, there would be no more Bourne movies and that would suck.",5,Matt Damon is givin a run for his money,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",2013,574,"['thought', 'movie', 'was', 'freakin', 'excellent', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'Bourne', 'universe', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'thing', 'franchise', 'Bond', 'Jeremy', 'Renner', 'excellent', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'skills', 'make', 'Matt', 'Damon', 'look', 'boy', 'scout', 'had', 'idea', 'guys', 'were', 'genetically', 'enhanced', 'not', 'just', 'trained', 'be', 'elite', 'assassins', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Damon', 'Renner', 'together', 'next', 'Bourne', 'movie', 'trying', 'shut', 'down', 'operation', 'shutthem', 'down', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'no', 'more', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'would', 'suck']",N/A

The absence of Bourne/Damon is a bit of a problem with this movie, but Jeremy Renner does a respectable enough job here to make his character interesting in it's own right.  Still, without Bourne/Damon being around anywhere, the use of the Bourne name in the title becomes something of a stretch.  Be that as it may, once things FINALLY got rolling after some rather tedious opening minutes, the movie took off on it's own momentum and I found it very well done and entertaining.  In addition to Renner's excellent performance, I really enjoyed the work of Rachel Weisz and Ed Norton.  So, the bottom line is that I feel that in spite of the absence of Bourne/Damon, Renner and company managed to pull things off well enough that I look forward to seeing a continuation of this franchise in the future.

The Bourne Legacy movie exposes a hidden world too frightening and dangerous to be covered by our impotent mainstream media.

Dying microbiologists. CIA black op funding. Drones over America.Bourne seems to be a &#34;Mr. Smith&#34; for the 21st century, except if  he were to &#34;go to Washington&#34; he would be assassinated by the &#34;government&#34; forces.
