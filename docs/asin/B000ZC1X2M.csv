1121893,AR3BZOTB7IY78,B000ZC1X2M,Anton Karidian,"[0, 0]","CLASSIC TELEVISION: BLOOPER BONANZA 1960s includes bloopers from the 1960s TV series ""Star Trek,"" ""McHale's Navy,"" and ""Laugh-In,"" each running about 15 to 20 minutes. About 15 years ago I bought at a science fiction convention a videotape of ""Star Trek"" extras, including hilarious bloopers from the original series. This is very similar to the bloopers on my videotape, including the length of about 15 minutes, but there are some differences here. Editing is a little different, and oddly this one is censored, whereas my videotape version was not. When someone says a curse word it's bleeped out, which is frustrating since you often can't tell what the person said. Since these bloopers have usually been shown at conventions and available for private purchase and NOT shown on TV, why were they censored here? Much of what's funny about bloopers is that people said and did things that could not be shown on TV, so in my opinion it's too bad that the uncensored version was not put on this DVD. I would have dropped my rating to 3 stars because of this, but decided not to because as far as I know this is the only place that these are legally available. Also, the picture and sound quality are still terrible here as they were on my videotape, although from what I've heard about their origin I'd say that there's probably not much choice there. I should note that some of the ""Star Trek"" bloopers are only fully understandable if you know a lot about the background of the show, but they're still funny even if you don't know those things. Perhaps optional subtitles should have been added to explain some of this.The ""McHale's Navy"" and ""Laugh-In"" bloopers are also very enjoyable although sometimes raucous, and with a little better picture quality than the ""Star Trek"" bloopers. I don't mean to minimize them, it's just that I know a lot more about the ""Star Trek"" ones. And I should note that despite the title of this DVD, there are NO bloopers from ""Bonanza"" here. Well, someone MIGHT think there were!",4,Glad to find these fun bloopers,1228003200,"11 30, 2008",2008,2016,"['CLASSIC', 'TELEVISION', 'BLOOPER', 'BONANZA', '1960s', 'bloopers', '1960s', 'TV', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'Laugh-In', 'running', 'about', '15', '20', 'minutes', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'bought', 'science', 'fiction', 'convention', 'videotape', 'Star', 'Trek', 'extras', 'including', 'hilarious', 'bloopers', 'original', 'series', 'very', 'similar', 'bloopers', 'videotape', 'including', 'length', '15', 'minutes', 'are', 'differences', 'here', 'Editing', 'little', 'different', 'oddly', 'one', 'censored', 'videotape', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'When', 'someone', 'curse', 'word', 'bleeped', 'out', 'frustrating', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'person', 'said', 'bloopers', 'have', 'usually', 'been', 'shown', 'conventions', 'available', 'private', 'purchase', 'NOT', 'shown', 'TV', 'why', 'were', 'censored', 'here', 'Much', 'what', 'funny', 'bloopers', 'people', 'said', 'did', 'things', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'shown', 'TV', 'so', 'opinion', 'too', 'bad', 'uncensored', 'version', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'rating', '3', 'stars', 'decided', 'not', 'because', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'only', 'place', 'are', 'legally', 'available', 'Also', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'still', 'terrible', 'here', 'were', 'videotape', 'what', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'origin', ""'d"", 'say', 'probably', 'not', 'much', 'choice', 'there', 'should', 'note', 'Star', 'Trek', 'bloopers', 'are', 'only', 'fully', 'understandable', 'know', 'lot', 'background', 'show', ""'re"", 'still', 'funny', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'optional', 'subtitles', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'added', 'explain', 'this.The', 'McHale', 'Navy', 'Laugh-In', 'bloopers', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'sometimes', 'raucous', 'little', 'better', 'picture', 'quality', 'Star', 'Trek', 'bloopers', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'minimize', 'just', 'know', 'lot', 'more', 'Star', 'Trek', 'ones', 'should', 'note', 'title', 'DVD', 'are', 'NO', 'bloopers', 'Bonanza', 'here', 'Well', 'someone', 'MIGHT', 'think', 'were']","Classic Television: Blooper Bonanza 1960's (featuring Laugh-In, McHale's Navy, Star Trek)"
