It had glitches, never really cared for Lena Headey as Sarah, John's mother.

Bisciglia ""Swerd Murd""","[0, 0]","I've always greatly enjoyed the Terminator universe and had been eyeing this show for some time.It definitely met, and in certain respects exceeded the expectations I had going in.the story picks up shortly after the events in Terminator 2, with a young teenaged John Connor moving about and attempting, with his mom Sarah, to outrun the events centering around the desctruction of Cyberdyne Industries and the murder of Mile what's-his-name (black dude from T2 that blew himself / the rest of the building up).  Shortly after the show begins, a Terminator discovers John in highschool, he's attacked, and it's revealed that he's under the protection of a female Terminator named Cameron.No, it's not nearly as poorly conceived as the female terminator from T3.  Cameron is the highlight of the series - and it doesn't hurt that the girl (Summer Glau) is gorgeous.They run away with female terminator in tow, and through a series of events end up moving forward in time to 2007.  Without spoiling anything, the device they use to move from T2's 1999 to our current-gen (at the time of show) 2007 was quite believable.  The cast of characters is really strong, and season 1 is spectacular.  Season 2 falls off a bit around the midpoint, but all in all it's very worth watching.The 4 stars and not 5 is due to the second season just kinda lacking... something.  It's worth powering through, as the story is a lot of fun to experience - but it takes a while to pick back up and permanently drops off right as they inject a new time travel arc into the story.Best character development in the Terminator series, thanks to the time afforded by a TV series vs. a movie.

Take Arnold out of it, and let's face it, you better have one heckuva great storyline & great characters. This show, unfortunately did not turn out this. Always miscast, Lena Hedley & Thomas Dekker bring a brooding whinyness to the series, with a distinct feel of emo. Sure, Summer Glau elevates the show, but she can only do so much. For the first season, I started out engaged, but as soon as I watched an episode back, I realized it was the drek that it was. Of course, by the time I realized this, I was already 8 episodes in, and it was too late to turn back. Going into the second year, it only got worse. I kept waiting for plotlines to go places, but they'd lose my attention before continuing it once more. I'd wait for action, but what there was, was disappointing at best. Make no mistake about it, TSCC is a sci-fi drama, but the drama is uninteresting & undramatic, and painfully bad at worst.Maybe I didn't get it, and maybe I'm not emo enough to put up with the brooding and emoness, but Fox made the right decision here in not renewing it for a 3rd season. I'm sure all would have been fine once the storylines, and the show got where it wanted to go, but I imagine in the end we'd all be left wondering why we wasted so many precious hours.

That is perfectly well done and John finds himself at the unripe age of eighteen in the middle of the final fight to the death between a handful of survivors and a mechanical world that has already tried to destroy humanity. I must admit the final tableau is a family reunion with John's own father, you remember that soldier that came down from the future to impregnate Sarah Connor with John, and that father's brother, John's uncle Derek who just died in our time, and John's cyborg he left behind all destroyed and her chip missing. We are ready for the last final descent onto the Rome of the machines. Hannibal has just arrived and the battle can start. It sounds like a clich&eacute;, and it is, and that's why it works. Now this long chase, hunt, escape, trek of this second season is a little bit blurry here and there and some characters that appear in one episode and disappear in the next are not very clear in their use and finality, except to entertain us. And entertain us they do with action, explosions, special effects, emotions and even a lot of suffering, even if only one lesson can float on top of this big saga: never trust officials because they are nothing but vampire who live on our blood and marrow, never trust FBI or ex-FBI agents because they are always big liars in order to capture and keep their power, never believe the scientific brains of this world because they always lie to protect and satisfy their greed. One exception maybe is a catholic priest but he is Mexican, so he is different. He even knows how to pray. And praying is essential when the birds of prey are after you. And this series is worth a fortune by the length of these films: nine hundred and thirty five minutes, fifteen hours thirty five minutes. Quite an achievement to watch it in one go, if you can do that.

I would have rated it lower if it weren't for the outstanding Samson & Delilah episode which has the best TV car chase of all time (Director David Nutter). Self Made Man is also much watch; like any classic episode of Star Trek Next Gen it had good morals, tommy gun action, and a crazy scifi plot. Mid-season production got lazy and did not use enough endoskeleton FX which Terminator was famous for. The blood curdlingly terrifying endo scenes were gone, replaced with wacky stunt(wo)men & a few gun fights. When the show was good it was REALLY GOOD and when it got bad/boring it unfortunately was a greater percentage of the time. Writing got corny. They changed Cameron too much and brought her out of line with the movies. I loved watching how sexy summer is in every scene, but I felt they kept her akin to Small Wonder's Vickie; a dumb robot. The nail in the coffin was the multiple character death. Every person I cared for dies. They didn't have the guts to kill bad guys or show the bad guys interact with John & crew throughout the entire 21 episode season!! Even worse was when the good guys started torturing people  (no joke!) for info and there was more than one episode in which they attend a funeral (why???). The writers even kill off an innocent dog.  Whoever gained the most creative control during season 2 is a sick person. I was scratching my head a lot, not for the plot, but at how destructive the writers became. I honestly believe the producer saw the end coming and decided to trash it all, despite what was said. Season 2 is in sharp contrast to all the cool hacks, computer chips, time travel, and endoskeleton stuff that was in season one. While I liked ALL of season one in its entirety, I think I enjoyed 4 episodes of this. But I did enjoy those 4 eps very much. If you saw season 1 you probably need to know what happens and should get this.I want to love it. I recognize the great talent and time involved: Thomas Dekker, Brian Austin Green, and Garrett Dillahunt singularly keep the show alive. Lena Headey as Sarah was mixed. The T&A; in season 2 is great but it comes where you'd least expect: the underutilized would-be superstar characters (Chola, Jesse, Riley). On the positive you'll find out what happens and watch something better than T4. You will also watch some rediculously awesome TV and hear some good music. I love Sarah Chronicles, but I'm reluctant to give this the full recommendation as I feel the creative & production talent, besides the actors and Bear McCreary (the composer), weren't truly on board for Terminator.",3,Needed More Endos,1253836800,"09 25, 2009",2009,2633,"['season', 'one', '5', 'stars', 'season', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'lower', 'were', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'Samson', 'Delilah', 'episode', 'best', 'TV', 'car', 'chase', 'time', 'Director', 'David', 'Nutter', 'Self', 'Made', 'Man', 'also', 'much', 'watch', 'classic', 'episode', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Gen', 'had', 'good', 'morals', 'tommy', 'gun', 'action', 'crazy', 'scifi', 'plot', 'Mid-season', 'production', 'got', 'lazy', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'enough', 'endoskeleton', 'FX', 'Terminator', 'was', 'famous', 'blood', 'curdlingly', 'terrifying', 'endo', 'scenes', 'were', 'gone', 'replaced', 'wacky', 'stunt', 'wo', 'men', 'few', 'gun', 'fights', 'When', 'show', 'was', 'good', 'was', 'REALLY', 'GOOD', 'when', 'got', 'bad/boring', 'unfortunately', 'was', 'greater', 'percentage', 'time', 'Writing', 'got', 'corny', 'changed', 'Cameron', 'too', 'much', 'brought', 'line', 'movies', 'loved', 'watching', 'how', 'sexy', 'summer', 'scene', 'felt', 'kept', 'akin', 'Small', 'Wonder', 'Vickie', 'dumb', 'robot', 'nail', 'coffin', 'was', 'multiple', 'character', 'death', 'Every', 'person', 'cared', 'dies', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'kill', 'bad', 'guys', 'show', 'bad', 'guys', 'interact', 'John', 'crew', 'entire', '21', 'episode', 'season', 'Even', 'worse', 'was', 'when', 'good', 'guys', 'started', 'torturing', 'people', 'joke', 'info', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'episode', 'attend', 'funeral', 'why', 'writers', 'even', 'kill', 'off', 'innocent', 'dog', 'gained', 'most', 'creative', 'control', 'season', '2', 'sick', 'person', 'was', 'scratching', 'head', 'lot', 'not', 'plot', 'how', 'destructive', 'writers', 'became', 'honestly', 'believe', 'producer', 'saw', 'end', 'coming', 'decided', 'trash', 'what', 'was', 'said', 'Season', '2', 'sharp', 'contrast', 'cool', 'hacks', 'computer', 'chips', 'time', 'travel', 'endoskeleton', 'stuff', 'was', 'season', 'one', 'liked', 'ALL', 'season', 'one', 'entirety', 'think', 'enjoyed', '4', 'episodes', 'did', 'enjoy', '4', 'eps', 'very', 'much', 'saw', 'season', '1', 'probably', 'need', 'know', 'what', 'should', 'get', 'this.I', 'want', 'love', 'recognize', 'great', 'talent', 'time', 'involved', 'Thomas', 'Dekker', 'Brian', 'Austin', 'Green', 'Garrett', 'Dillahunt', 'singularly', 'keep', 'show', 'alive', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'Sarah', 'was', 'mixed', 'T', 'A', 'season', '2', 'great', 'where', ""'d"", 'least', 'expect', 'underutilized', 'would-be', 'superstar', 'characters', 'Chola', 'Jesse', 'Riley', 'positive', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'what', 'watch', 'something', 'better', 'T4', 'will', 'also', 'watch', 'rediculously', 'awesome', 'TV', 'hear', 'good', 'music', 'love', 'Sarah', 'Chronicles', ""'m"", 'reluctant', 'give', 'full', 'recommendation', 'feel', 'creative', 'production', 'talent', 'actors', 'Bear', 'McCreary', 'composer', 'were', ""n't"", 'truly', 'board', 'Terminator']",N/A

Season 1 was pretty decent but then in season 2 john suddenly decides he wants to do everything just because he feels like it or that can't be so because i don't want it to be.  Kind of reminds me of Hannah (Ashley Benson) in Pretty Little Liars who's main philosophy behind why things are or are not a certain way is based on one and only one premise alone.  Extrapolate that into John's mind and here is an example of what you might come up with.  Oh Mom, I invited a complete stranger over to our new place and totally compromised our whereabouts but we don't have to worry you know why?  Because I don't want it to, that's why and nothing in this universe can refute that.  So Season 1 went from a pretty decent show to nothing but one mishap after another and your typical adolescent angst fueled drama.

Personally, I never missed an episode (which is rare for me and television.) It was intelligently written, intriguing, well acted and perhaps a little too smart for television.Granted Terminator was a sci-fi show and they are risky these days. Furthermore it was continuing an established franchise in a different way. Let's face it though, T2 was marginally okay (Edward Furlong nearly ruined the entire movie) and T3 was terrible. TSCC was a huge improvement! With all the hype for the upcoming Terminator Salvation, I would have thought that Fox would wait to see the box office on that and then make their decision.The decision to keep Dollhouse and cancel TSCC shows that Fox is going to bow down to Joss Whedon on name value alone, no matter what garbage he produces (I may be the only person not terribly impressed by him.)TSCC was a great show and it will be missed.",5,"A well written, well produced show lost by a bad decision",1242691200,"05 19, 2009",2009,942,"['real', 'shame', 'brains', 'Fox', 'have', 'cancelled', 'show', 'Personally', 'never', 'missed', 'episode', 'rare', 'television', 'was', 'intelligently', 'written', 'intriguing', 'well', 'acted', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'smart', 'television.Granted', 'Terminator', 'was', 'sci-fi', 'show', 'are', 'risky', 'days', 'was', 'continuing', 'established', 'franchise', 'different', 'way', 'Let', 'face', 'T2', 'was', 'marginally', 'okay', 'Edward', 'Furlong', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'entire', 'movie', 'T3', 'was', 'terrible', 'TSCC', 'was', 'huge', 'improvement', 'hype', 'upcoming', 'Terminator', 'Salvation', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Fox', 'would', 'wait', 'see', 'box', 'office', 'then', 'make', 'decision.The', 'decision', 'keep', 'Dollhouse', 'cancel', 'TSCC', 'Fox', 'going', 'bow', 'down', 'Joss', 'Whedon', 'name', 'value', 'alone', 'matter', 'what', 'garbage', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'not', 'terribly', 'impressed', 'TSCC', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

Paul ""John doe""","[3, 6]","You have to take the good with the bad for TSCC season 2 the fanalie for season 1 left a cliffhanger that left me waiting from early March to early September.EP.1 Sampson & Delilah **_this was a complete disappointment Cameron goes bad it's a watchable episode but disappointing considering the 6 month wait.EP.2 Automatic for the people **_a power plant that is under the control of the Resistance in the futer is in danger becuse a Terminator is sent back to get it under there control oh & that idiot Zack Ward guess stars in this episode small part though.EP.3 The Mousetrap **_In this episode Charley's wife is kidnapped by Cromartie so Derek & Sarah go & help Charley Cromartie also try's to go after John We also watch more of John & Riley I think Riley's character is pretty useless but her & Tomas Dekker have great on screen chemistry so I can't hate her.EP.4 Allison from Palmdale *_I was really looking forward to this episode & they blew it they really tried for a European style but failed. They went about Cameron's origin all wrong should've been done more like Kikaider. Skip it doesn't offer anything.EP.5 Goodbye To All That ***_A really good episode a gut that is important to John in the futer is being targeted by a T 888 Derek & John go to a military school to save him.EP.6 The Tower Is Tall But The Fall Is Short **_decent episode there's this Physcitrist that might be endangered John tries to kill himself in this episode I thought WTF? Oh & a girl from the futer Jessie comes back & Derek knows her it's just an excuse for a sex scene like every other TV show. A Terminator comes back from the futer to kill this Doctor the last episode had a reason to send a Terminator back this 1 doesn't.EP.6 Brothers Of Neblus *_a pathetic episode that just let Cromartie track the Connor's down & there's this scene where Cromartie is trying to find John & Cameron he has his back turned & John & Riley are going right down the dairy section. That's funny like the episode of Family Guy where Peter tries to get disability. SKIP!EP.8 Mr. Furgeson Is Ill Today ***_the big 1 Sarah, John, Cameron & Derek take on Cromartie should've been the season opener.EP.9 Complications *_another episode you should skip Cromartie has already been dug up & well Agent Ellison took care of that Sarah has werid dreams & Derek has a useless storyline with Jessie why becuse Jessie is a useless character.EP.10 Strange things happen at the one two point *_skip it skip it good Riley is from the futer & to me it just doesn't work for her character & just another boring story for Cameron & Sarah.EP.11 Self Made Man *_ever wonder what Cameron does at night since she doesn't sleep. NO! Just a lame storyline for probably my favorite Sarah Connor Chronicles Character to beat up a Terminator. You know what to do about $****y episodes.EP.12 Alpine Fields **_ An episode you don't have to actually skip it's ok a woman connected to Derek & Jessie in the futer is under the target of a T 888 this woman's daughter & unborn child will be important in the futer for Derek & Jessie they really wanted the Jessie character to be important but she just didn't click for me.EP.13 Earthlings Welcome Here **_another episode that was just ok Sarah is looking for another person connected to Skynet basically she meets a drag queen or he she yay. John & Riley have there same enjoyable on screen relationship Catherine Weaver has control of Cromartie he's John Henry now Cromartie was the closest thing to the stlaking style of Arrrrrrrrrrnooolllllld Schwarzeeeneggeeerr & Robert Patrick now he's Weaver's b***h.EP.14 The Good Wound ***_this was a really good episode Sarah has been wounded by a gunshot wound but & Kyle Reese's spirit guides her through it. I liked Kyle Reese in the 1st Terminator movie but most of the time I was like you're not Kyle Reese Micheal Biehn is but I enjoyed this episode The T 1000 killed a bunch of people in a factory she served her purpose. Cromartie now John Henry is playing with toys I was upset how they took his character from that staliking style to Weaver's b***h.Ep.15 Desert Cantos **_decent episode a couple of the guys that worked at the factory that was blown up in the previous episode by weaver are still alive I guess they are connected to Skynet most of the episode focused on the funeral  this episode had bad side characters at the funeral. It's a watchable episode.EP.16 Some Watch While Other Must Sleep *_an episode that you need to go ahead & skip Sarah goes to this factory that owned the factory that was destoryed well she's held captive by the guy she thought she killed at the facotry it goes back & forth between Sarah being held captive & Sarah having a dream about being in a clinic for insomnia this was not brillant it would've been better if Sarah was held captive & Derek, John & Cameron go & save her @** simple & effective more than I can say for this little episode.EP.17 Ourselves Alone ***_a episod I really got into Jessie is working behind Riley's back just to get Cameron to kill her. Cameron's hand is messed up & next time her chip messes up she gives him a device that will destroy her. Jessie kills Riley in a fight.EP.18 Today Is The Day part 1 **_ Nothing special John finds out about Riley & we get a real boring Storyline with Jessie. Savanah is a better character than Jessie & I mean it.EP.19 Today Is The Day part 2 ***_this episode I liked John finds out who killed Riley I really enjoyed Sarah & Cameron's interaction during this episode. Jessie is told to leave by John I'm not for sure if she just left or Derek killed her just as long as the Jessie character isn't on the show anymore. I don't hate the Woman playing her I just felt her character wasn't for Terminator either that or she didn't click with me.EP.20 To The Lighthouse ***_it's such a shame that they waited till the 2nd half of the season to have good episodes back to back. Sarah & John have really good interaction. Sarah doesn't trust Derek cause he was off seing you know who. Charley is in this episode Sarah & John go to his Cabin unfortantly he is killed. Derek is captured Cameron saves him. Cameron & Derek have some good interaction as well. Good episode.EP.21 Adam Raised A Cain ***_this was another good showing by the cast Connor's beleive Savanah is in trouble John saves her he proves why he's was a good choice for John Connor I know it was a Terminator but Derek is cheaply killed off & we have the scene where Sarah is arrested Savanah is returned to her ""Mother"". Savanah & John Henery singing Donald where's your trausers really brought the episode down.EP.22 Born To Run ****_great episode John & Cameron have to bust Sarah out of jail John & Sarah find out Catherine is a T 1000 & she is here to stop Skynet John gets sent to the futer where Derek Reese & Kyle Reese are there Cameron is there but as a human Allison Young. Cameron Cameron gave her chip to Cromartie/John Henry. Yes & no it was perfect way to end the series. What I mean is those of us that were fans of this show know FOX cancelled it I knew right at the end that it wasn't going to get a 3rd season. A lot of things led to this show being cancelled weak opening plus bad episodes back to back. On disc 6 they said they had 8 writers the use of 8 writers gave a lot of episodes a very non Terminator feel. A lot of episodes had no continutiy like with the 1st season in the gag reel it really shows that they hated some of the dialoge. Disc 6 also has behind the scences with the effects crew which is great. For a TV show the props make up damage were d**n near movie quality I felt they really cared about the show. But they brought everyone & the Pope to come kill John Connor & they made just about everyone they could from the futer like Riley that was just so stupid. Saving the strongest episodes for the second half of the season at that point the viewing audince wasn't there anymore. So I wasn't surprised that when it was cancelled it's a good season it's just so d**n flawed. The 1st season was the best season 2 you should get but it is very flawed. It's really up to the buyer cause I'll tell you it's better than this reality TV crap or a lot of the shows that are on TV now.",3,TSCC season 2 had it's goods & definitly it's bads,1264982400,"02 1,

It lacks unity, suggesting to me that the production team was casting around seeking something for the show to be about.  It leaves copious important story threads unresolved from the prior season, and introduces new threads it doesn't know how to use.At points, the creators try to manufacture a family drama, with Cameron's unknown loyalties complicating what appears to be her growing affection for John, with the obvious implication that maybe the machine could fall in love.  At other points it plays more like an adventure show, especially in episodes that foreground Ellison, now a private contractor.  And a long mid-season arc resembles an unproduced X-Files episode.I understand that the chase sequences that drove the feature films cannot sustain an ongoing television series.  Maybe, by going different directions through the season, the producers want to avoid the trap of Farscape or BSG, so the show won't alienate new viewers.

The first 2 episodes were less than stellar and unfortunately caused many people to discontinue watching it before it got progressively better with each subsequent episode until it became FANTASTIC by season's end. James Ellison became my favorite character as he has a totally different take on the events that transpire than any of the other characters and introduces biblical prophecy into the mix of what is to come.Season 2 has been a more personal study of the different characters and at the same time an enigma. After watching these characters for an entire season you actually find out WHO they really are in Season 2 and how they developed into their current personalities. We even find out about Cameron's(John Connor's Terminator Protector) backstory and even about the human she was modelled after. Instead of understanding her (it)better, the writers took the opposite approach that they did with the other character reveals and she actually becomes MORE of a mystery, especially in the season finale. It was sad to see a couple of supporting characters die in the latter episodes, but their storylines had pretty much hit an obvious plot wall. I just wished that one of the character's demise had been more sacrificial or at least a little more heroic. But, its the Terminator and somebody ALWAYS dies...Shirley Manson's character (Catherine Weaver) plays a major role in the second season. As Season 2 progresses, you realize that there is something completely different about her behavior than the rest of the Terminators. Even though its obvious that she is a T-1000 (liquid metal Teminator from T2) she seems to have another another agenda than just eliminating Skynets potential enemies (if she even IS working for Skynet ;-) ). Its interesting to see her interact with Savannah (her human daughter) and how she realizes that Mommy doesn't behave like she should or like she remembers. And the plot twist in the season finale is jaw-dropping and Awesome. At the same time it creates more questions than it answers. I'm really looking forward to Season 3 (FOX willing) and seeing plot questions answered and the pieces come together for John's maturity into the John Connor we know will lead the resistance and help save human beings from extinction.With the upcoming movie series ""Terminator Salvation"" I think there will be enough positive buzz to entice Fox to venture forward with at least 1 more season of this very popular series that has a definite cult like following...""We were that close to going out for ever.

Thus my top-rated science fiction series this year remains the brilliantly-conceived and character-driven Stargate Universe (I haven't seen Caprica yet). Nonetheless, I really look forward to each episode of this series, because the characters and stories are so rich and complex. You might wish to reconceptualize this series as a science fiction/drama employing an action ""theme"" as a driver. The writers are brilliant.

In many ways it seems superior to the Terminator movies, in spite of what was no doubt a much smaller budget.The major characters were all well cast.  Sarah and John are believable characters for people in such extreme circumstances.  Lena Headey's role as a soft-spoken Sarah Connor was, for me, a big improvement over the strident Sarah in the T2 movie, a more complex character struggling with how to translate her love for her son into the discipline needed to keep him alive and to ready him for the impossible role he is to play in the salvation of humankind.  And Thomas Dekker does a great job as a brooding young John Connor as he struggles with his mother and comes to grips with the reality of his destiny and the depth of his sacrifice.You can think of the TV series as being like T2 but with half the action and ten times the character development.  The series is about human courage, flaws, suffering, relationship, and what makes us different from machines -- all delivered in a Sci-Fi action envelope.Summer Glau did a great job as a Terminator; she is beautiful while still having a slightly unusual face -- large eyes and a big forehead.  When she holds perfectly still, tilts her head to the side slightly, opens her big eyes wide but keeps the rest of her face expressionless, she invokes the ""uncanny valley"" effect (look it up on Wikipedia) that makes her seem slightly creepy.  I feel sorry for her having to do more mundane ""beautiful young woman"" roles since; the Terminator role was perfect for her, and she did it justice.  And even her role as a cyborg was used to explore what it means to be human, with Glau appearing at times vaguely compassionate, but then suddenly turning brutally inhuman.Most of the other roles are interesting and well cast, too.  The fellow who played Cromartie / John Henry did a wonderfully creepy job.  For some reason I didn't really like the role of Riley Dawson that much, though -- the one weak spot for me personally.  I think that role was intended to help us understand what this all meant for John Connor, but it rubbed me the wrong way somehow.The special effects are reasonably generous (but of course modest compared to the T movies), and there is a good deal of action.  Episode 1 of Season 2 is particularly awesome -- true edge-of-your-seat entertainment.The cancellation of this show was a shock to many people; kind of makes you wonder.  I think part of the problem may be that this show is a bit dark -- more like Stargate Universe and the new Battlestar Galactica than, say, Stargate and Stargate Atlantis.  Sci-Fi doesn't appeal to everyone, and even less so when it's the dark variety.  Add to that what were probably relatively expensive production costs, and it didn't make it.Too bad!  This was really good work.

It picks up again at the end, but the ending is incredibly depressing.*spoilers*It seems that almost everyone misunderstands the ending. It is NOT a happy one. The redheaded terminator was NOT a hero. Think hard about the last 5 minutes of the finale. She protected John from the drone to gain his trust, then what? She immediately makes him jump 19 years into the future, where Judgment Day has long since passed, and he meets the humans of 2027. When they start talking, the truth comes out...NOBODY KNOWS HIM.I REPEAT: NOBODY IN THE FUTURE KNOWS WHO JOHN CONNOR IS.He never became the leader of the human resistance after JD, because he wasn't around. He jumped from 2009 to 2027. He's a nobody. The redhead's mission was not to kill him but to make him absent and irrelevant. She succeeded. Why would the drone crash into the office at that exact moment? She staged it...there is no other logical explanation.*end spoilers*This show is worth watching once, if you are a Terminator fan. Sure, it is full of plot holes, and sure, the effects are bad and the writing questionable. However, there are some great moments that make it worth the effort. There is plenty of eye candy and a fair amount of respect is paid to T1 and T2. I don't think Lena Headey was tough enough to play the war machine that Sarah Connor had become after T2. She had huge shoes to fill and didn't really live up to Linda Hamilton's at-all-costs portrayal of the character. She was too soft and feminine, which has its appeal, but is not what Sarah became to protect her son.",3,A mixed bag...with a very depressing ending.,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,1673,"['was', 'fairly', 'thrilled', 'beginning', 'season', '2', 'middle', 'show', 'rather', 'tedious', 'boring', 'up', 'again', 'end', 'ending', 'incredibly', 'depressing', '*spoilers*It', 'almost', 'everyone', 'ending', 'NOT', 'happy', 'one', 'redheaded', 'terminator', 'was', 'NOT', 'hero', 'Think', 'hard', 'last', '5', 'minutes', 'finale', 'protected', 'John', 'drone', 'gain', 'trust', 'then', 'what', 'immediately', 'jump', '19', 'years', 'future', 'where', 'Judgment', 'Day', 'long', 'passed', 'humans', '2027', 'When', 'start', 'talking', 'truth', 'out', 'NOBODY', 'KNOWS', 'HIM.I', 'REPEAT', 'NOBODY', 'FUTURE', 'KNOWS', 'WHO', 'JOHN', 'CONNOR', 'IS.He', 'never', 'became', 'leader', 'human', 'resistance', 'JD', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'jumped', '2009', '2027', 'nobody', 'redhead', 'mission', 'was', 'not', 'kill', 'make', 'absent', 'irrelevant', 'succeeded', 'Why', 'would', 'drone', 'crash', 'office', 'exact', 'moment', 'staged', 'other', 'logical', 'explanation', '*end', 'spoilers*This', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'are', 'Terminator', 'fan', 'Sure', 'full', 'plot', 'holes', 'sure', 'effects', 'are', 'bad', 'writing', 'questionable', 'However', 'are', 'great', 'moments', 'make', 'effort', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'fair', 'amount', 'respect', 'paid', 'T1', 'T2', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'was', 'tough', 'enough', 'play', 'war', 'machine', 'Sarah', 'Connor', 'had', 'become', 'T2', 'had', 'huge', 'shoes', 'fill', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'live', 'up', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'at-all-costs', 'portrayal', 'character', 'was', 'too', 'soft', 'feminine', 'appeal', 'not', 'what', 'Sarah', 'became', 'protect', 'son']",N/A

1167207,AHF97M45JFCB,B001AQO43M,ONENEO,"[2, 2]","How often can it really be said that a television series actually atones for some of the big budget feature film releases of the same franchise?  Calling it a rare occurrence is massively underplaying it and yet that's exactly what many viewers consider Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (especially against the very average Terminator 3: Ride of the Machines).It would turn out that Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles Season 2 would become last season of a solid science fiction television series that was well on its way to being a great one.  Fans will delight in the bitter-sweetness that is an exceptional boxset containing some of the show's finest moments as a grave marker for the entire series.  It's especially distressing on the staff commentary tracks where clearly the network's decision to cancel the series had not yet been revealed.Unlike so many shows of late, this is one where the second season actually capitalized and realized much of the potential promised of in the first (which was pretty darn good itself). The cast expanded, with the addition of Brian Austin Green and Shirley Manson (yes the singer of grunge band Garbage). The scope of the prose enjoyed expansion as well, with new Terminators, timeline fluctuations (with visible consequence/ effect) and the intensity of the possibility of lead character death ever-present.The acting, which was far above the norm for network television in the first series, actually manages to somehow improve for this season.  It's apparent that Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker became far more comfortable with their roles as Sarah and John Connor respectively while Summer Glau is given the opportunity to contrast her role as a human rather than a machine along the way.  Brain Austin Green was perfectly cast as Derek Reese (the brother of John Connor's father, Kyle) and Richard T Jones continues to dazzle with his gritty performance as James Ellison.  Garret Dillahunt takes the Cromartie role to the next level with an opportunity to ""reset"" his character here and even Shirley Manson, surely the biggest question mark of the casting selection, absolutely astonishes with her portrayal of a T1000 (liquid metal Terminator).Naturally the restrictions of television budgeting result in a program that's not quite as visually stunning as the recent films of the franchise, it is very possible that it looks as good as, if not better than some of the earlier movies.  When T2 hit theaters, the whole ""liquid metal"" element was simply mind-blowing and Season 2 demonstrates the tactic ever-bit as well and as casually as if it were old hat.Even so, the program ranks as among the best of the best of CG-heavy action on television. Just like with the films, massive explosions and gunfights abound with dark, moody environments and tones.  While it would be easy for the show's creators to fall into a rhythm based upon what's worked thus far, major kudos go out for the decision to keep the characters' whole world an ever-changing affair (just as it should be given the back story of living off the grid, always on the run).The Dolby Digital audio is mixed quite solidly as well, which is a treat considering how solid the visuals turned out. The sound follows the onscreen action with near feature film precision and though a bit front-loaded to compensate for the abundance of dialog, the use of 5.1 Surround is particularly noteworthy.In addition to a full-color booklet with episode synopsis, the extras (spread across the full 6 discs) include: ""The Continuing Chronicles: Terminator"", an 8-part featurette gallery The Storyboard Process: Cameron Goes Bad Gag Reel Cameron vs. Rosie Fight Rehearsal Commentary on ""Samson and Delilah"" Commentary on ""Allison From Palmdale"" Commentary on ""Adam Raised a Cain"" Commentary on ""Born to Run"" Terminated Scenes on Select EpisodesJust like with the first set, perhaps my biggest complaint is the mental overload of the source material's heavy reliance upon time travel.  If you really want to be a stickler, there are a few plot holes and mismatches that rear their ugly heads when laid out against the movie's timeline but in all honesty, and considering the overwhelming ambitions in sorting it all out, the television crew does an admirable job of keeping it straight.About the biggest tragedy surrounding the whole affair is that the series does not end conclusively as again, it was cancelled before the production team could tie up all of the loose ends.  As it stands (and fortunately) the 22nd (and final) episode does not end on a cliffhanger per se, it just boggles the mind to consider where the writers were going next.  Considering that the program was nominated (and won) countless awards from the likes of the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, Emmy, People's Choice, Teen Choice, Visual Effects Society, and Young Artists Awards, the credentials speak far louder than any network's poor decision-making.  It's nearly impossible to come away from the second season without concluding that the series was just starting to find its rhythm.  It's sad that the show got the ax (especially considering how much junk was renewed) but I suppose the good news is that the Second Season box set is a beautiful addition to any library and a chance to own one of few truly impressive network television efforts of recent times.",5,Quality Entertainment in a Worthy Box Set Collection,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,5372,"['How', 'often', 'can',

Fitcher ""Namahotitae""","[3, 3]","This is the second season of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", a strong departure from the calmness and tranquility of the first season. This is much more gritty, with more action, and less filler. In one way, it seems to me, that this season is trying just a little too hard to be like the first movie, or at least tie into the first movie. Creating a downside.  The downside is for those who really liked the first season and wanted more of the same. This is clearly not the same. It takes place a lot closer to Judgement Day, with a very clear goal for both the Connor group and the cyborgs. There are some downsides to this season. For one, there are way too many people and cyborgs being brought back to the present from the future. I find that all of this clutters up the storyline, which may have been the reason or at least part of the reason for cancellation (I do not really know why it was canceled.) There are major changes in John Connor, such as he loses the hair for a more adult hair cut, John finds a girlfriend. She too is tied to the future, though he does not know that. Derek reunites with a past girlfriend/lover from the future who has ties to Johns girlfriend, but neither John nor Derek know that. Which further muddies the storyline in my humble opinion. There just seems to be too much from the future that is brought back to mold, shape, and protect John Connor. That all having been said, I have seen the first 10 episodes from this season and find that I just cannot stop watching it. So, if you like action, I mean non-stop, gripping your seat, biting your nails, white knuckle action, this is for you.

I can't say for sure I was totally wrong, as the first season may have been as inferior as it seemed.  However, the second season has done it for me.  This is the first new sci-fi series in some time I can say has grabbed me.  In fact, possibly exceeding the quality of the spy/cop drama 24, which just had its two highest-quality seasons after several years of losing me during their last thirds every time.True, season 2 of Terminator is not yet over, but I need to post this.  The music is phenomenal.  I don't know what the composer did before this, but he's got a very special ear and taste.  The photography and use of lighting has impressed me.  They cut John Connor's hair and got rid of that idiotic Ken-doll runway-model look.  The whole series, in fact, seems to have gotten shaved, mussed up, dirtied, and taken a shot of increased realism in its collective arse.  At the same time, they've focused in on smaller sub-stories and dramatic elements, even going so far as taking side episodes to explore this or that aspect of a particular character's life.  It's having the effect of fleshing out their development in a way I haven't seen since, well, Star Trek: TNG.Is the cast at that caliber?  Is the writing?  No and no.  But it's really getting there, and to be fair, Next Generation was a huge budget, cast hand-picked by Rodenberry, and every stage actor & TV movie writer who'd grown up on the original series interested in being involved.  The X-Files is just an enigma of high-quality television, so it's terribly unfair to compare anything else to it.  Duchovny had the range to play a cross-dresser in Twin Peaks, for god sakes, another in this trinity of perhaps the greatest series in TV history.  The Terminator spin off had a lot working against it considering how myself and everyone I know wrote it off even before the pilot, and while at first blush it seemed to be a clich&eacute;d, dramatically rough, overly ""pretty"" & youthful start, I think they may have found their footing...possibly in spite of the latter.Interested in what I missed the first season and curious to see if my first impressions of last year's episodes were correct or not, I will shortly buy the complete first season and watch it strait through before making any further comments on it.  That original review is deleted, or should I say...no, no I don't think I'll go there.

The show had some outstanding episodes in the second season and a few in the middle that tended to drag, making the overall season uneven. What I want to address here is the season two DVD set itself. I found while the episodes themselves were well presented, the extras on the sixth disk were totally unwatchable due to technical issues with the disks themselves. The extras on disk 6 are full of glitches, the images are heavily pixilated, and the audio is choppy and out of sync when it plays at all. The extras are totally unwatchable, but since it was impossible to discover this before I had opened the set and played the entire second season run, the set probably is unreturnable. So if you want the episodes, the set is fine, but if you want the extras forget about it. Overall rating I give the second season four stars, the DVD set two stars for an average of three stars.I am adding this later because when I contacted Amazon about this issue with the extras, even though the set was opened, they offered to let me return it and order a new set or a refund of 33% of the purchase price.

1167226,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001AQO43M,Robert Moore,"[137, 156]","Warning!  Multiple spoilers!As I write this review, just after the end of TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, the future of the show is very uncertain.  The ratings after the show's move to Friday night in February 2009 were never strong, although it persistently ranked #1 among shows having the largest percentage of their viewers watching via DVR.  The brute fact is that TSCC did not lack for viewers; it lacked for live viewers during broadcast.I hope very much for a Season Three of TSCC.  This was easily one of my favorite shows for the 2008-2009 season.  When it was on Monday nights, I watched it live rather than either CHUCK or GOSSIP GIRL, two shows that I enjoy.  When it moved to Fridays I intentionally stayed home to watch it (and then for six glorious weeks DOLLHOUSE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, for what was perhaps the finest nights of TV I've ever experienced).  Although the show lagged a bit just after its midway point (unfortunately right when it moved to Fridays), it remained persistently fascinating for the entire year.  If I had access to a button that would allow me to choose between either having the upcoming film TERMINATOR SALVATION or TSCC vanishing, then we would never have the movie but would get a Season Three of the TV series.  My preference is based on a love of character development and a richly articulated story, neither of which is possible in a 120-minute movie.  Besides, most movies quickly degenerate into a special effects extravaganza, and the previews of TERMINATOR SALVATION definitely leads one to fear that that is precisely what we will get this summer.I do have a couple of complaints with the TV series.  I think that the writers sometimes allowed it to drag a bit in Season Two.  And while I'll grant that ""Sarah Connor"" was in the title and that John Connor is ultimately the crucial character in the Terminator saga, far and away the most interesting character on TSCC was Cameron.  Most of the weaker episodes were notable for having little or no Cameron.  Most of the truly great moments on the show had Cameron front and center.Let me interrupt myself to insist that if you DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, to not read any futher!Season One focused primarily on tracking down the possessors of a computer with an advanced AI named ""The Turk"" (the name alluding to a famous 18th century chess playing machine in the shape of a Turkish male that vanquished many opponents before it was revealed that it was a hoax, a chess master actually hiding inside the machine).  That apparently accomplished, Sarah, John, and Cameron embarked on a series of clues that led them to the ZeiraCorp, headed by a shape shifting terminator played by Garbage lead singer turned actress Shirley Manson.  One of my favorite things about Season Two is that for nearly the whole season we are led to believe that Catherine Weaver (Manson) is an evil Cyborg.  After all, she kills numerous individuals and resurrects deceased evil Cyborg Cromartie to serve as the body for John Henry, the super computer that her company is building.  But in the season (series?) finale she is revealed to be on the side of the angels.  Or is she?  Given an easy opportunity to kill John and Sarah, she not only does not do so, but saves their lives.  And both John and Sarah seem to take her at her word.  All season long viewers had been looking forward to a Weaver/Cameron encounter, but instead we see Weaver insisting that she is fighting SkyNet, just as they are.  The whole plot is further complicated by Cameron apparently refusing Weaver's offer to join her cause.  The fact is that at the end of the season Cameron and her agenda remains a total mystery.For the past year I've been engaged in a detailed study of robots in the history of myth, literature, film and television.  TV robots and Cyborgs have been widely prevalent but also not terribly complex.  I deeply love a character like Sharon Agathon on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, but Sharon is so clearly human - even if a Cyborg - that she doesn't really challenge our understanding of human/robotic relationships.  She looks like us, acts like us, and feels like us.  It is difficult to say in what significant sense that she isn't as much as a person as any human.  Cameron is perhaps the most complex, challenging robot/Cyborg we've ever seen on TV.  Summer Glau brilliantly portrays her as something both more than and less than human, something undeniably strange and ""other.""  She apparently lacks feelings, yet definitely has her own motivations.  She is a machine, yet at times seems eerily human, such as taking pains over her toe nail polish or practicing ballet.  She even tries, in one Season Two episode, to make a friend of her own.  Seeing her make her very odd overtures to a wheelchair bound guy is one of the strangest things on the show, including her telling him that the cancer that he previously suffered from has returned.  Though she intends it kindly, she doesn't grasp why her telling him something that she shouldn't be able to know and that he finds so emotionally devastating effectively ends their friendship.  Even odder is that the sudden ending of their relationship seems to have no impact on her.  There is absolutely no question that within the next half-century robots will begin to play an increasingly important social role in human life.  In Japan especially scientists are working hard on companion robots for children and for the elderly.  It is impossible to imagine that they will not also play a role with many other humans as friends (most people consider their dogs to be friends and they can't talk like robots are on the verge of being able to) and even romantic companions.  Cameron is the only robot on TV that I know of that raises many of the questions about robot/human relations that will be increasingly pertinent in the coming decades.  If TSCC is not renewed for a third season, ending Cameron's story will be one of the great losses on the show.  At the end of Season Two she remains a complete mystery.  I personally want that mystery resolved.Though we didn't need additional proof of it, TSCC is yet another example of the fact that there is absolutely no connection between quality, viewership, and renewal in American television.  It is further proof of just how broken commercial TV is.  The brute fact is that TV series are, from the corporate point of view, vehicles for commercials.  If they provide a platform for a large number of people to see the commercials that are the economic heart of the shows, they are in the eyes of the networks great shows.  Absolutely dreadful shows like TWO AND A HALF MEN or the endless police procedurals on CBS illustrate this.  I've never seen a respected TV critic with a kind word for TWO AND A HALF MEN, yet it remains the most watched half hour comedy on television.  Thus, it is the best platform for advertising.  PUSHING DAISIES was cancelled at midseason despite more critical acclaim than any other series on the four major networks.  Perhaps for fans of television the major networks have outlived their usefulness.  If they can't find a place for a show as fine as TSCC on their schedules, it is proof that TV is broken.  FOX eats up huge gobs of its schedule with the unceasingly awful AMERICAN IDLE while NBC has eliminated five hours of scripted TV in the 2009-2010 schedule so that they can hand it over to the untalented and uninteresting Jay Leno.But it isn't the networks that are to blame.  It is the American TV viewer.  As long as we tune in to AMERICAN IDLE, various reality dancing shows, TWO AND A HALF MEN, and police procedurals, they are going to keep giving us crap.  I am a radical on this.  I actually think that there is an ethics of TV viewing.  I honestly believe it is immoral to watch 20/20 or TWO AND A HALF MEN and that it will be unconscionable to watch Jay Leno's new series.  Or if you must watch these horrible shows, at least DVR them.  As long as they are the best vehicles for commercials, we are going to continue to lament the cancellation of the better shows and the unceasingly continuation of critically unacclaimed and artistically empty series.The one reason for hope for TSCC is the film TERMINATOR SALVATION, which is likely to be the biggest box office hit this summer.  This past year Warner Brothers negotiated a smaller licensing fee with FOX, which was a factor in its renewal.  Perhaps the film in combination with a similar deal from Warner Brothers could lead to another season.  We can hope.",5,A superb series that is crying out for renewal,1239408000,"04 11, 2009",2009,8541,"['Warning', 'Multiple', 'spoilers', 'write', 'review', 'just', 'end', 'TERMINATOR', 'SARAH',

I say this because the focus is on plot and the larger philosophical questions. The acting is well done and the questions raised during the course of the the first and second seasons are very thought provoking and open-ended. Having also purchased the first season of Fringe, I find that both of these excellent series fill a void left by the departure of the ""X-Files."" This is particularly true of Fringe, but Terminator: The TV Series also belongs to the genre of cerebral science fiction. Personally I have no doubt that Asimov would have been a fan of both of these series, if he had lived long enough to see them.

Superb acting, storylines, it took the cheesy gimmick script and storyline of T3 and said ""to hell with it!""I eagerly awaited each new episode of The Sarah Connor Chronicles during its sophomore season with more gusto than I did LOST.An epic web of mythology is created in season 2, the idea of multiple versions of the future becomes the main focus, with almost all of the 22 episodes executing a strong amount of intrigue, in a much more intelligent style than the ""Terminator-of-the-week"" format of season 1.With the show tanking in the ratings but earning it all back in DVR (damn the target audience for being so web-savy!) the show was cancelled in favour of Dollhouse, which, while not a better quality product in comparison, is Joss Whedon's latest baby and FOX kinda owed him after screwing him round last time...HOWEVER - there is a chance that in the style of another sci-fi epic, Battlestar Galactica, Terminator TSCC could be revived in the form of the DVD Movie. After the epic conclusion of Season 2, its what fans want!But from a business standpoint, no one will sign off on that unless interest is still there.What we need to do is buy this boxset, show the world what a fantastic fanbase this show has - because however we accessed the show when it originally aired, the format that binds us all together is home video!

The machines know about John, and have been sent back to terminate him before Judgment Day. There is also Cameron (Summer Glau), a machine sent back to the past to protect him. But Cameron seems to have another agenda as well. And joining the team on a regular basis this season is John's uncle Derek Reese (Brian Austin Green).Settled in a new safe house, Sarah begins having visions, starting an obsession with a symbol of 3 dots.  John's relationship with his girlfriend Riley develops, and Cameron seems jealous. But Riley is revealed to be working with Derek's old flame, who has a mission of her own.  Meanwhile, Agent James Ellison (Richard T. Jones) is hot on the trail of the Connors.The Connors kill the terminator Cromartie (Garret Dillahunt) that has been following them since last season. But someone has plans for the body. Shirley Manson comes on the scene as liquid terminator Catherine Weaver, a soulless machine that kills without a thought. Catherine uses the dead terminator's body to build a new AI, named John Henry. But Catherine doesn't seem to be sent back to kill John Connor. Instead, her focus is on John Henry and helping him learn what it means to be human. The characters are all perfectly cast. But Dillahunt's change from killer to new AI innocence steals every scene that he's in. And Manson's portrayal of the liquid terminator is always chilling.The second season of the Sarah Connor Chronicles was even better than the first. With new mysteries, more danger, and John trying to break free of his mother's shadow.  Sarah and John are still trying to stop SkyNet before Judgment Day comes. Everyone has their own agenda. And each episode is more exciting and thrilling than the last. This was easily one of the best shows on television last year.Unfortunately, Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles was not renewed for a 3rd season. And the end of season 2 leaves us with an enormous cliffhanger, where John travels to the future, where Cameron seems to be human and Derek doesn't recognize John.There is no better way to watch the Sarah Connor Chronicles that on Blu-Ray.

And that 4th movie they made - I did NOT like at all!!There is NO Arnold Schwarzenegger in this. Cameron the Terminator - I doubted she'd pull it off - but she is Great!I think as this TV series progressed - it drifted off too much into like a drama or soap opera. I really don't care about John Connor's love interests.Too much mulling around - and people being uptight and temperamental.And the real action - and not as much for special effects - started to turn me off.Still - I don't get why there wasn't a season 2. Maybe it was written for just two seasons?BTW - Now that Arnold Isn't Governor anymore - Where is the next installment of the movie series?? - I'm Ready!!,4,Very Well Done - but as it progresses - gets more into drama,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,802,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'favorites', 'are', 'Terminator', '2', '3', 'original', 'effects', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'done', 'now', '4th', 'movie', 'made', 'did', 'NOT', 'like', 'NO', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Cameron', 'Terminator', 'doubted', ""'d"", 'pull', 'off', 'Great', 'think', 'TV', 'series', 'progressed', 'drifted', 'off', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'soap', 'opera', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'John', 'Connor', 'love', 'interests.Too', 'much', 'mulling', 'people', 'being', 'uptight', 'real', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'started', 'turn', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'season', '2', 'Maybe', 'was', 'written', 'just', 'two', 'seasons', 'BTW', 'Now', 'Arnold', ""n't"", 'Governor', 'anymore', 'Where', 'next', 'installment', 'movie', 'series', ""'m"", 'Ready']",N/A

My problem is that I thought the original movie was just about perfect - a closed loop that needed no sequel. It had a beginning and an end, a past, a present and a future, and the photograph tied it all together. I was disappointed by T2 for the simple reason that they changed that future and I didn't want them to. Selfish me. I saw some bits and pieces of the show when it aired, but didn't try to get into it. Then I saw T3 and didn't quite hate it, but close. I thought &#34;Is this guy ever going to grow up?&#34; Then I saw Salvation and thought &#34;He hasn't changed! What a wimp! Where the heck is John Connor?&#34;So I watched the series, and was satisfied for the first time in years. Their story follows directly on the heels of T2, but it had to start somewhere and it goes a long way toward validating what I wouldn't accept before. Season 1 was all about exploring the characters, but Season 2 was about the story. One of the the things I love the most about this second season is that it does what the movies didn't: We get to watch Sarah Connor's boy turn into John Connor, the legend. Thomas Dekker is brilliant in showing the man a sixteen-year-old can become if he has to.I was a little let down by the ending, but only because of the open holes and unanswered questions. That said, they had been cancelled and had to do something. What they did do with what they had provided an outstanding ending for the series. I can't really go into my feelings without giving out spoilers, so I just have to say that while it was a little disappointing, I was highly satisfied with what they gave us, and I have no real complaints.

Harris ""Steve Harris""","[0, 0]","The first season of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles was enough to make me go 'This is one of the best shows that's on.'  Season Two of the show took what Season One did and took it to another level with not only more episodes but more of a chance to tell a story about the whole Terminator mythology.  Sure this season got off to a slow start but as it got more and more into it, I believe that the whole season blew the first season out of the water if not out of here in some way or another.  We had some introductions to some new characters such as 'Catherine Weaver' who turns out to be like that of the T-1000 from the second movie not sure if it's the same model or maybe a little more advance than the T-1000.There are other things that was interesting like with Catherine Weaver who seemed to not take the side of Skynet, and what her intentions were I have no idea.  We even learn about 'Cameron's' backstory as to the person she was modeled to look like, and let alone that a couple characters die before the end of the Season but by the time that the Season finale came about the twist at the end there.  Like I said there are things that they went about doing for this show even though it only lasted two seasons but it exceeded my expectations by far and I wish that there could've been a third season to help tie up any loose ends that were left in the Season Two finale.

Apparently, many of them felt that not enough stuff blowed up real good - totally ignoring the fact that the series was smart and well done, based on solid characterization with a deft mix of drama and humour, along with the requisite action.The second season DVD set is very well put together: lots of behind-the-scenes material and some generally excellent commentary tracks.

Well, be sure to see the early 2008, 9-episode season premier, because Season 2 doesn't really measure up. If you liked Season One like I did, you'll probably be compelled like I was to catch Season 2.The fall season of Season 2 ended last night on FOX. And they announced that the second 1/2 of Season 2 will pick up in early 2009...on its new night: Friday night. You know what they say about shows that get moved to Friday nights?

And as Sarah Connor you have Lena Headey who I had never even heard of until her recent role in300.In Season 1 the entire cast of The Sarah Connor Chronicles took their roles seriously, and they preserved the integrity and the awesomeness of the movies that spawned the TV series. I'm not seeing that in Season 2. I'm seeing continuity issues within the series itself and now big time with the films. Sure, the producers of the TV show need to take some liberties with the T 1 - 3 storyline that fans of the movies are so familiar with, but they are either running out of good ideas that can sustain the integrity of the relationship to the movies or they just don't really care about that relationship anymore. In Season 2 you really have to try not to think about why there's never any reference to all this TV show stuff in T3.I'd recommend seeing Season 1 before venturing into Season 2, but then you'll be hooked into going for a disappointing Season 2.

1167243,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B001AQO43M,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[3, 3]","I am undeniably a child of the eighties, growing up going to theaters to watch movies like ""Jurassic Park"", ""Stargate"", ""Deep Impact"" and ""Independence Day."" But one particular sci-fi film stands out.  I went in 1991 to see ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" with my dad and older brother and being only 10 felt like a BIG GUY; going to see an ""R"" rated film in the Theaters with my male family members.  The thing was that the film scared the ever living snot out of me! It also intrigued me, and captivated me and surprised me and had me cheering and sitting on the edge of my seat.  So, dad took me home and showed me the first one; which scared me even more and yet I was captivated by the whole aspect of these machines who looked SO incredibly like US! And the struggle that WE went through against them and also with them.  I always thought it would make a FANTASTIC t.v. show! But all I got in the subsequent years following ""T2"" was ""T3: Rise of the Machines"", which had a fantastic female teminator, a fantastic ending, but a horrendous premise and first 2/3's!  So, when I heard about ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"", I was 100% along for the ride from day one...I was only scared of one thing, that the show would follow ""T3"", but after hearing who they hired for John and that it was set shortly after ""T2"" my fears were gone.  Then just to seal the deal, I heard that Summer ""Wow"" Glau, my favorite TV hottie was cast as the new Terminator, I was pumped. Needless to say, Season One did not disappoint.I felt that the show was a strong breath of fresh air, instead of what many thought it would be; ""Terminator of the week chase and escape"", we got a well thought out intensely character driven show, that made you use your brain.  Yep, I said it.  In a world of ""American Idol"", ""Ugly Betty"", ""Desperate Housewives"", and about 10,000 reality shows there are very few shows with a brain.  ""CSI"", ""Fringe"" and ""Lost"" being two rare exceptions.In what started out as a chase show, smartly steered away as John, Sarah and Cameron (Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey and Summer Glau respectively) decided to find away to shut it down, and that lead to them:- Going to the future/present- Creating a few well thought out time paradox's- Getting the FBI on their tale- Causing a few innocent deathsand a few other choice incidents, but just like on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" choices had consequences, even choices like going to pick up a birthday cake.Picking up said cake is where we leave the crew at the end of season one, Derek Reese; Kyle Reese (John's father)is introduced near the end of season one and brings a fantastic dynamic, spreading a small seed of untrust between John and Cameron.  Cameron gets into their SUV and BOMB! See you next season.The seeds laid in season one are just the ground work for what would have become an ICONIC show if Fox had given ""T:TSCC"" the time to grow.  What we see in Season Two are the first blooms of the tree that is planted.  Regular and trusted characters aren't always meant to be trusted. Damage can't always be fixed; figuratively or physically. Being the good guys is in the eye of the beholder, and many other things are looked at in this season.The main focus is on John's loosing trust in his mother, then his loosing trust in Cameron and finally realizing that he must stop hiding behind others and take the forefront.  We follow Cameron on an arc of self discovery, can she really love John or is it all a programmed lie, and who was the woman that she was modeled after?  We see where Dereks intense distrust of Cameron comes from, and find out a few secrets of his own. And what of Ellison? Is he good, bad, neither?We're introduced to some Fantastic new characters.  Lead singer of Garbage; Shirley Manson takes on the role of Katherine Weaver a CEO of a powerful computer industry who holds a big secret of her own.  Stephanie Jacobsen is sexy and misunderstood as Jesse who's story, because of the show's cancellation, will never be fully explained, wash she good or bad? What's here ""REAL"" fate? Levin Rambin is fantastic as Riley, Johns new love interest who; as with everyone else has her own agenda and secrets to keep.The action of season two was amped up, as were the effects, due to the addition of a T-1000 to the cast, and the Connor gangs attempts at finding pieces to the puzzle of what is happening; we have many great new effects.  The look of the new HK (Hunter Killer) that plays a large role in the middle and end of the season; looks just as good as it's big screen counterparts.  The T-1000's morphing scenes and action scenes are fantastic as well.Josh Freidman is such a fantastic story craftsman, he knows how shows usually play it and he goes the opposite way half the time and then when we expect him to do one thing, out of the clear blue, something else.  Watch the episode ""Adam Raised A Cain"" and ""Today is the Day Parts I and II"". No one is safe in this world, and death even the deaths of our lead cast are not forbidden. In fact, they start to drop like flies in the final four episodes, leading to what I consider to be one of the best season/series finales of all time. It's just a shame the show was cancelled, what was given to us in season two was magnificent.  Maybe somehow in the near future, we as fans will get a third season, maybe on another channel or online, who knows.

To my shock and surprise however, it ended up being one of the most thoughtful, intelligent and intense shows on television. It did tend to lag at times, but this helped to build to the heart-wrenching choices and brutal confrontations the characters faced. The show was bleak, brooding, deep and at times had a great sense of dry humor. It's darkness and slow pace probably sealed its fate in the world of network television though, where only the base, boisterous and obvious get consistent attention.This show took time with its plots, characters and scenes and it may have been a let down for those who came expecting nonstop explosions, gunfire and cyborg action. There was a good deal of this, but usually only when it was necessary. The rest of the time was spent developing the characters, their relationships and how they collectively dealt with not only being at the focal point of an oncoming human apocalypse, but also trying to stop it from happening, despite all of the issues that strained their strange family.It was heartbreaking for this show to be canceled, but it at least ended in a way that provided some possible closure, if you used your imagination. This could certainly not be said for the ill-fated Firefly, a potentially brilliant series that Fox utterly betrayed. Despite its short run, I'm glad I got to see this excellent short-lived series. Perhaps, it would have had a full run on a cable network like HBO, but now I'm just dreaming about what could have been.In any case, please watch this show.

1167267,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B001AQO43M,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 6]","It's hard to figure out why ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" lost its audience. Perhaps it's the lack of humor (although there is some dark humor in the series)or perhaps it just didn't have enough variety for most people in the story department. Either way when Fox moved the series to Fridays (any show on Friday is making a slow death march towards cancellation the only exception to that rule was ""The X-Files"").That's a pity because the show demonstrated a knack for sharp, intelligent writing, action and was amazingly well made. The first season ran into a few minor road blocks with the first being the Writer's Strike which meant season one was cut short. The second season had some terrific episodes (and yes some of them had humor--albeit dry or dark humor but humor)and ""Terminator"" like its sister series ""Fringe"" had terrific production values making it a joy to watch.The second season of ""Terminator"" dovetailed nicely with the four movies. The second season although it became a bit uneven towards the middle of the season picked up with a strong five final episodes. The cliffhanging grand finale also kicked butt but unfortunately we're not going to find out how the show was going to be resolved (Producer/writer John Middleton had plans to create a series of two hour movies to conclude the show but unfortunately that seems less and less likely although if this sells well enough who knows?).The Blu-ray looks stunning with a sharp, detailed image rivaling the best transfers I've seen.""Write the Future"" features writer-producer-show developer Josh Friedman discussing how he came up with the story arc and individual episode plots for the second season.We get a number of commentray tracks including one on the second season opener featuring actors Thomas Dekker,Lena Headey, Summer Glau, actress/singer Shirley Manson and writer-producer Josh Friedman.""Blood and Metal"" focuses on make up artist Rob Hall and how he creates the make up effects for the show.Although the show loses a bit steam mid-season it regains it by the handful of final episodes and suggests that there was a lot of potential for this show. It's a pity it was terminated.""Designing Destruction"" lets Production Designer Marek Dobrowolski take center stage showing his designs for some of the futuristic sets and how he integrates real locations into the series.""Choreographing Chaos"" has 2nd Unit Director Joel Kramer and Special Effects Supervisor Steve Galich talking about and demonstrating how they create the imaginative stunts for the show without putting anyone in harm's way.""War Stories"" isn't about the imaginary future but, instead, has production crew discuss the challenges they faced in creating a science fiction show on time, often on location and on budget. For example, there was an unexpected earthquake that disrupted shooting on one day and they had to figure out a way to safely shoot the underwater sequences that appear during the second season on a their budget.""Motivations""  lets the producers discuss the themes of season two.""Cameron vs. Rosie: Fight Rehearsal"" gives us behind-the-scenes footage of the choreography sessions for the major fight involving Summer Glau . All I can say is that there is an amazing contortionist involved.""Setting the Tempo"" lets music composer Bear McCreary (""Battlestar Galatica"") discuss how he develops many of the music cues for the series. Shirley Manson (of the band Garbage and one of the series regulars) performs on the opening season song ""Samson and Delilah"" and she discusses working with McCreary.""The Storyboard Process"" takes us behind-the-scenes and lets us see the development of key sequences from the second season and how they were realized.We get a gag reel and finally audio commentary on key episodes by stars Lena Headey, Thomas Dekker, Summer Glau, Shirley Manson along with writer-producer Josh Friedman and producers James Middleton and John Wirth.Finally the Blu-ray has an exclusive interactive special feature ""Collision with the Future: Deconstrutcting the Hunter Killer Attack"". It allows viewers to take a look at the individual elements from a variety of views.I'd suggest starting with the brief first season of the show before starting with this set (although the first season is nicely recapped in a 45 second introduction to the first episode of this season). The second season continues the story set up during season one--Sarah Connor (Lena Headey-""300""), her son John (Thomas Dekker), Cameron (Summar Glau-""Firefly"", ""Serenity"" and ""The 4400"") a Terminator from the future sent back to protect John and Reese (Brian Austin-Greene the original ""Beverly Hills 90210"") are trying to unravel the technological thread that allowed Skynet to take over the world and nearly make humanity extinct by going after the people and companies that developed the AI intelligence. They face a new threat from the CEO (Garbage singer Shirley Manson)of a company that is trying to develop the technology of that will help lead to the possible extinction of mankind.",4,It's too bad
