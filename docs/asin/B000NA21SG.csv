Boorman,"[2, 4]","Cedric the Entertainer is one of the funniest men working in movies today.This is an average-to-below average story; it's been done before in so many ways, but Cedric manages to make it feel fresh and new.  Even Better - this is easily one of the funniest movies you will see this year.Cedric, a master of humor,  manages to be funny on so many levels.  He can be subtle, with deceptively simple wordplay and simple glances.  A raised eyebrow, at the right time is much funnier than a poorly played pratfall.  Forutnately, Cedric is also a genius at physical comedy, as well.  If the clog dance and the spanking scene were not proof enough, the sequences of him trying to be Arnold as the commando should prove it beyond any doubt.Cedric allows his fellow comedians their moment to shine as well.  Although this was clearly a 'star vehicle' for him, he generously gives great opportunities to his co-stars to show their comedic chops.Get this movie - it will pick you up when you're down.  Look, it's not meant to be a 'deep movie.'  It's meant to be a lot of laughs.  The world is a rough place.  We have enough Serious.  We need Funny.  We don't need depressing stuff.  We need entertainment.Cedric is exactly what he says he is - THE Entertainer.",5,You will laugh a lot at this one!!,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,1249,"['Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'one', 'funniest', 'men', 'working', 'movies', 'average-to-below', 'average', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'Cedric', 'make', 'feel', 'fresh', 'new', 'Even', 'Better', 'easily', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'will', 'see', 'year.Cedric', 'master', 'humor', 'be', 'funny', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'can', 'be', 'subtle', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'wordplay', 'simple', 'glances', 'raised', 'eyebrow', 'right', 'time', 'much', 'funnier', 'poorly', 'played', 'pratfall', 'Forutnately', 'Cedric', 'also', 'genius', 'physical', 'comedy', 'as', 'well', 'clog', 'dance', 'spanking', 'scene', 'were', 'not', 'proof', 'enough', 'sequences', 'trying', 'be', 'Arnold', 'commando', 'should', 'prove', 'doubt.Cedric', 'fellow', 'comedians', 'moment', 'shine', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'clearly', ""'star"", 'vehicle', 'generously', 'great', 'opportunities', 'co-stars', 'show', 'comedic', 'chops.Get', 'movie', 'will', 'pick', 'up', 'when', ""'re"", 'down', 'Look', 'not', 'meant', 'be', ""'deep"", 'movie', 'meant', 'be', 'lot', 'laughs', 'world', 'rough', 'place', 'have', 'enough', 'Serious', 'need', 'Funny', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'depressing', 'stuff', 'need', 'entertainment.Cedric', 'exactly', 'what', 'Entertainer']",Code Name - The Cleaner

I don't understand why so many people think the movie was unfunny.

He turned over and it was a dead guy!- A man sliding into a glass door, and the glass shattering- Cedric putting skittles in his butlers mouth.  The look on the guys face was priceless!- Also, the butler neatly placing the skittles in a glass jar in an attempt to make them look fancy was a nice bonus touch.- During a car ride scene, a bad man who was laying on the roof went flying into a bunch of parked cars when the driver suddenly put the brakes on.- One of Cedric's friends in a bathroom bending over and a janitor coming in and seeing something he shouldn't have seen, lol- When Cedric was playing golf, and the golf ball bounced back and nearly hit the butler in the mouth.
