1480791,A2IMP5N1CT9M80,B005LAII44,AbsolutelyNutts,"[2, 6]","So after liking the first GI Joe Movie, I was worried about the sequel as most of the critics panned it .. 30% rotton. But they said the same about the first one (Rise of Cobra). It's a direct sequel, so you have to see the first one to understand this film.Now this is a fantasy action movie, so the story was completely implausible, and some characters were just thrown in there like they just needed a reason to sell more action figures. But I can't help but love the nostalgia of it all, as I had a good many of the original toys in the 80's. And, to my excellent surprise, it was good, and the adventure moved along well. It is very action packed with cutting-edge special effects. The movie kept my male/21st-century brain at attention. I was so engaged that I didn't even eat my overpriced concession snack. (The downside was that I couldn't find a good place to go to the bathroom).  So I must give it a healthy 4.0/5 stars. I'll definitely want to watch it again. But for a non-fan, you might hate it along with the critics. Final Say: If you saw the first GI Joe movie, and liked it, then you'll like this one too.

1480792,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B005LAII44,Ace Reader,"[18, 23]","Cobra is at it again. This time the Joe's are under attack from within their own government. Hit hard with most of the Joe's dead they are now led by Roadblock, played by American actor Dwayne Johnson. He and his remaining team want revenge for their lost teammates by seeking help from General Colton (the original Joe), played by American actor Bruce Willis. They know something must be wrong with the Commander and Chief, played by Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce, for this kind of strike to have been authorized. With Colton's help they devise a plan to find out what has happened to the President and stop what they believe to be a Cobra Commander takeover of epic proportions.Director Jon M. Chu has done a good job directing slick action scenes in this film. My two favorite parts were scenes where the Joe's hide in a well to escape raining fiery death coming down on them by the attacking enemy Cobra, and second the completely amazing and exciting very well choreographed Ninja ropes scenes high in the mountains. All were very entertaining and fun to watch. All the Ninja fights scenes between Snake Eyes, played by Scottish actor Ray Park and Storm Shadow, played by South Korean actor Byung-hun Lee were impressive and well done. These two scenes helped make the admission price worth it.""G. I. Joe: Retaliation"" is a little bit better then it's predecessor, but only a bit. The plot line is a sequel to 2009's ""G. I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra"". Here again we have an old worn out plot line I think is used way too much by Hollywood. I wish they would come up with something different, fresh and new. Meanwhile we are fed this kinda boring evil bad guy wants to take over the world scenario. If I do have to watch this story line I don't mind it too much if the scenario is done with finesse. I don't think this one was. This script is borderline good and bad. One of the things most wrong with this script was it's lack of emotion being conveyed to me the audience for it's characters. I did feel the beginnings of a connection in the beginning of this film. Then the emotions I was feeling for the characters was blown to kingdom come within it's first hour. A prominent member of the Joe's team dies stupidly in this film and I can't for the life of me understand why the writers of this franchise wrote something so wrong. This character they killed off is NOT supposed to die in this story line at all. After that I was ticked off and put off by the events of the plot line. I think this films writers (Rhett Reese and Paul Werrick) were really misguided for killing off one of this franchises most important characters. What they were thinking is anyone's guess. I think they were crazy.So beware of this film. Along with it's great action sequences it has many cheesy silly ones as well. It is entertaining, but over all not that great. Frustratingly a beloved central character bites the dust bugging me enough for me to loose a lot of interest in this series. I wont be watching this film again any time soon. And, I'm not looking forward to seeing any more G. I. Joe films. If you do choose to see this somewhat entertaining action film...Enjoy!Release date: 28 March 2013Rated: PG-13 for language and violence.Running Time: 110 minutesAction/Adventure/Science FictionGrade: C+",3,"""Entertaining but frustrating second installment of the G.I.

For JOE fans, its a very realistic and believable portrayal of an iconic franchise. And for the general movie goer, its an awesome action film with a great story and great characters. My one compliant is Duke's apparent death. He is my favourite character and I was hoping that these rumours about him dying were mis-information.However I do hope that he is brought back in some manner. Duke is one of the core elements that make GI Joe what it is and as the blowback with the recurring deaths of Optimus Prime from the Transformers franchise show, you cannot just ditch one of the best characters. And I like the fact that like Duke, Channing Tatum himself as a genuinely good person as well (Its very rare in his profession and its a reason why he's one of my favourite actors). Its this quality that was also a reason why I really enjoyed seeing Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Joseph Colton. Jonathan Pryce is equally excellent as a villian and as a good guy and the portrayals of Lady Jaye, Flint, Jinx, Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow were pitch-perfect. The story itself is really well written and, as previously mentioned, a very realistic take on the franchise.This is a much better movie than other reviewers say and - provided that Duke is brought back and Channing Tatum plays him again - I'm looking forward to the next film in the series.

GI Joe goes beyond being a movie based on a comic book. It's actually based on a doll - excuse me - action figure. But its dubious genesis aside, this movie is pretty good. It is, of necessity, science fiction. It follows a formula: The elite action team is framed for wrongdoing, betrayed, attacked and slaughtered, and disavowed by the nominal civilian authorities. The team, all by itself, has to regroup the survivors, figure out what happened to the President, and engage in a series of implausible infiltrations and armed actions to crush the bad guys and restore the rightful authority to power.The plot is pretty standard - Think &#34;Dirty Harry.&#34; Except it's not one cop stepping outside the box, it's a small military unit.But we aren't looking for anything profound, are we?

(amazon = 1-2 stars bad, 3 stars ok, 4-5 stars good). I am being a little nice here with giving this film 4 stars because it had pretty cool, graphics, stunts, cool weaponry and machines.This film fell way flat for me though in regards to the first one. The first joe had channing and marlyon and there was a lot of energy and excitement. This sequel *spoilers* wrote channing out, didn't even have marlyon and basically was just all about dwayne johnson. With that bad taste in my mouth being said it was a decent film. The first half was a little slow but it picks up the second half of the movie. I kept thinking channing tatum would somehow come back in the film but the producers obviously just wanted dwayne johsnon in it. Probably because of not wanting to pay actors salaries, which is usually why they have to cast b-list actors. Even though I may consider dwayne j. an a list actor i was expecting a lot more out of this sequel and was let down / disappointed. But if i woudl have seen this film as a separate film it would have been ok. I don't know what is up with hwood movies lately feeling very generic and stale but you can just pop out any piece of garbage and think it's going ot be the next blockbuster.Not else is to be said about this film.

Action films based on toy soldiers, not the next Schindler's List. Now that I've gotten that out of my system, on to the review. This is a FUN MOVIE. 100% better than the first when it comes to characters, action, story, direction, pretty much everything. The Joes are more gritty and down to earth military with a few high tech toys only this highly trained special mission force would have. The Rock is a great addition and shows us why he's gone from the ring to a blockbuster action star. Cobra Commander is finally done right, not only looking but acting the part. I'm not going to give away any story details, I will only say there is a plotline for Storm Shadow that parallels one from the original comics run. Nice nod to the fans there. The film takes 2 paths, one with Roadblaock and the Joes pursuing Cobra and another with Snake Eyes and Jinx taking on Storm Shadow and the Red Ninjas. This allows for both full auto gunplay and fist fighting action on one side and crazy martial arts moves and ninja swordplay on the other.

So, I now am used to the fact that whenever Hollywood reaches back for a childhood favorite, they usually get it half right and mess up the rest.Now what did they got right for this movie?...SNAKE-EYES vs. STORM-SHADOW! For just the scenes of these two rival ninja brothers going at each other is worth taking a look at this film!However, what did this G.I. JOE movie get wrong?..In ten words....""THE ROCK being the new leader of the G.I. JOES""!Dwayne Johnson, the former WWE wrestling star, does an somewhat okay job playing ROADBLOCK, I guess. Yet, here's the main problem: ROADBLOCK  was a mid-tier G.I. JOE character. He was never ever in charge of the whole the G.I. JOE TEAM! ROADBLOCK, in the comics and in the classic '80's cartoon, was just an anti-convoy and anti-tank specialist! A cool character to blow stuff up and to buy you some time for your main offensive attack, but he wasn't nowhere to even being close to the field leader that DUKE was!Killing off  DUKE, the real field leader of the G.I. JOE team, is like killing off CYCLOPS and PROF. XAVIER so that WOLVERINE, an extremely talented brawler but not a great strategist, can be the new leader of the X-MEN. It's like killing off OPTIMUS PRIME so that BUMBLE BEE can be the new leader of THE TRANSFORMERS! It's like killing off CAPT. AMERICA so that THE HULK can be the new leader of THE AVENGERS!..It's very lame! Very lame, indeed!I don't know. This movie feels like ""THE ROCK"" is being shoved down my throat as ""the next movie action hero""! I groan whenever he's on the screen and I look at my watch to see what time it is. It's a shame, too, because I'm a big wrestling fan who loved ""THE ROCK"" in the ring. I think that's where he should be.If ""THE ROCK"" (Dwayne Johnson) is the lead in the next G.I. JOE movie and they don't bring back DUKE or SCARLET, I'm jut going to have to dishonorably discharge G.I. JOE for lameness and a senseless waste of the movie studios' money in the face of really hard economic times, and  I am hereby restricting G.I. JOE from having any more active duty within the borders of my DVD collection!RECRUITS!...DIS-MISSED!....",3,"KILLING OFF DUKE WAS WAY LAME!..AND WILL SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE ""THE ROCK"" GO BACK TO WRESTLING WHERE HE BELONGS?",1385596800,"11 28, 2013",2013,2213,"['G.I', 'JOE', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'comic', 'books', 'cartoon', 'shows', 'back', '1980', 'So', 'now', 'am', 'used', 'fact', 'whenever', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'usually', 'get', 'half', 'right', 'mess', 'up', 'rest.Now', 'what', 'did', 'got', 'right', 'movie', 'SNAKE-EYES', 'STORM-SHADOW', 'just', 'scenes', 'two', 'rival', 'ninja', 'brothers', 'going', 'other', 'worth', 'taking', 'look', 'film', 'However', 'what', 'did', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'movie', 'get', 'wrong', '..In', 'ten', 'words', 'ROCK', 'being', 'new', 'leader', 'G.I', 'JOES', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'former', 'WWE', 'wrestling', 'star', 'somewhat', 'okay', 'job', 'playing', 'ROADBLOCK', 'guess', 'here', 'main', 'problem', 'ROADBLOCK', 'was', 'mid-tier', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'ever', 'charge', 'whole', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'TEAM', 'ROADBLOCK', 'comics', 'classic', ""'80"", 'cartoon', 'was', 'just', 'anti-convoy', 'anti-tank', 'specialist', 'cool', 'character', 'blow', 'stuff', 'up', 'buy', 'time', 'main', 'offensive', 'attack', 'was', ""n't"", 'nowhere', 'even', 'being', 'close', 'field', 'leader', 'DUKE', 'was', 'Killing', 'off', 'DUKE', 'real', 'field', 'leader', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'team', 'killing', 'off', 'CYCLOPS', 'PROF.', 'XAVIER', 'WOLVERINE', 'extremely', 'talented', 'brawler', 'not', 'great', 'strategist', 'can', 'be', 'new', 'leader', 'X-MEN', 'killing', 'off', 'OPTIMUS', 'PRIME', 'BUMBLE', 'BEE', 'can', 'be', 'new', 'leader', 'THE', 'TRANSFORMERS', 'killing', 'off', 'CAPT', 'AMERICA', 'THE', 'HULK', 'can', 'be', 'new', 'leader', 'THE', 'AVENGERS', '..It', 'very', 'lame', 'Very', 'lame', 'indeed', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'ROCK', 'being', 'shoved', 'down', 'throat', 'next', 'movie', 'action', 'hero', 'groan', 'whenever', 'screen', 'look', 'watch', 'see', 'what', 'time', 'shame', 'too', ""'m"", 'big', 'wrestling', 'fan', 'who', 'loved', 'ROCK', 'ring', 'think', 'where', 'should', 'be.If', 'ROCK', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'lead', 'next', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', 'DUKE', 'SCARLET', ""'m"", 'jut', 'going', 'have', 'dishonorably', 'discharge', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'lameness', 'senseless', 'waste', 'movie', 'studios', 'money', 'face', 'really', 'hard', 'economic', 'times', 'am', 'hereby', 'restricting', 'G.I', 'JOE', 'having', 'more', 'active', 'duty', 'borders', 'DVD', 'collection', 'RECRUITS', 'DIS-MISSED']",N/A

Alas, almost an entire year after it's original release date, G.I. Joe: Retaliation has finally seen the light of day. Compared to it's predecessor released four years ago, it's a stronger and better film, although it's still completely over-the-top and lacking in any meaningful plot. With that being said, it's a hell of a lot of fun!The premise behind the film involves the G.I. Joes being framed for the theft of nuclear warheads by master-of-disguise Zartan, who is impersonating the Commander in Chief (Jonathan Pryce). The fake President gives the order to eliminate the team of Joes, culminating the annihilation of their leader Duke and the rest of the team, save for three members; Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Flint (relative new-comer D.J. Cotrona). Together, along with the help of Snake Eyes and Jinx, the Joes go after Cobra Commander, Zartan, Storm Shadow, and the rest of the baddies to put a stop to their maniacal plans for world domination.Johnson continues to prove he's one of Hollywood's most entertaining action stars, as he plays the part of the atypical macho man with ease. His on-screen camaraderie with Channing Tatum is easy and believable, and he delivers his one-liners perfectly. It was also nice to Palicki, formerly of Friday Night Lights, in the female ass-kicker role, and Bruce Willis is very John McClane-ish in his cameo, which makes for some fun on-screen moments. One of the standouts for me was Pryce, who completely owns his role as the Zartan-impersonated President, and has some of the best lines of dialogue in the movie.There's some great stunt work and special effect moments that make this movie a blast to watch. One in particular that comes to mind is a breathtaking sequence that involves a sheer cliff and ninjas...need I say more? The CGI looks better than in the preceding film as well. When it comes down to it, I think there was only one goal the filmmaking team was trying to achieve with G.I. Joe: Retaliation, and that was to entertain. Do yourself a favor and grab some buddies, pop some popcorn, and enjoy this kick-ass action flick.",4,Better than the Original and a Blast to Watch,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,2306,"['Riddled', 'bad', 'reactions', 'test', 'audiences', 'plagued', 're-shoots', '3D', 'conversion', 'post', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'believed', 'film', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'released', 'Alas', 'almost', 'entire', 'year', 'original', 'release', 'date', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Retaliation', 'finally', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'Compared', 'predecessor', 'released', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'stronger', 'better', 'film', 'still', 'completely', 'over-the-top', 'lacking', 'meaningful', 'plot', 'being', 'said', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'premise', 'film', 'G.I', 'Joes', 'being', 'framed', 'theft', 'nuclear', 'warheads', 'master-of-disguise', 'Zartan', 'who', 'impersonating', 'Commander', 'Chief', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'fake', 'President', 'order', 'eliminate', 'team', 'Joes', 'culminating', 'annihilation', 'leader', 'Duke', 'rest', 'team', 'save', 'three', 'members', 'Roadblock', 'Dwayne', 'Rock', 'Johnson', 'Lady', 'Jaye', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'Flint', 'relative', 'new-comer', 'D.J', 'Cotrona', 'Together', 'help', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Jinx', 'Joes', 'go', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'Zartan', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'rest', 'baddies', 'put', 'stop', 'maniacal', 'plans', 'world', 'domination.Johnson', 'prove', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'entertaining', 'action', 'stars', 'part', 'atypical', 'macho', 'man', 'ease', 'on-screen', 'camaraderie', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'easy', 'believable', 'one-liners', 'perfectly', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'Palicki', 'formerly', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'female', 'ass-kicker', 'role', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'very', 'John', 'McClane-ish', 'cameo', 'fun', 'on-screen', 'moments', 'One', 'standouts', 'was', 'Pryce', 'who', 'completely', 'role', 'Zartan-impersonated', 'President', 'best', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'movie.There', 'great', 'stunt', 'work', 'special', 'effect', 'moments', 'make', 'movie', 'blast', 'watch', 'One', 'particular', 'mind', 'breathtaking', 'sequence', 'sheer', 'cliff', 'ninjas', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'CGI', 'better', 'preceding', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'down', 'think', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'goal', 'filmmaking', 'team', 'was', 'trying', 'achieve', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Retaliation', 'was', 'entertain', 'Do', 'favor', 'grab', 'buddies', 'pop', 'popcorn', 'enjoy', 'kick-ass', 'action', 'flick']",N/A

The plot line moves along at a healthy pace, the opening of the film gives a brief summation of events that have occurred since the first film and a short bio of the main characters.  While I was disappointed that *SPOILER ALERT* they killed off the main character of Duke, I understood it was a plot point to help serve the motivation of the characters in the story.I understand that Hollywood, like any business, has to go where it gets the best value for its money - that said the biggest disappointment for the film, for me, was when the story moved to Fort Sumter in South Carolina for a nuclear summit of world leaders.  I was born and raised in South Carolina and have visited Fort Sumter many times, so I was dismayed to see that it was not Fort Sumter featured in the film - but instead was Fort Pike in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Again, I get that Louisiana probably afforded Hollywood the best price break to film there, but it would have been nice to have had the story at least be adjusted to reflect that it was not Fort Sumter they were going to.All of this being said, the story was exactly what one would expect from a summer movie, lots of action, great special effects, and explosions that deliver as advertised.",4,Great action!,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1359,"['widely', 'publicized', 'negative', 'reviews', 'first', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Retaliation', 'plot', 'line', 'moves', 'along', 'healthy', 'pace', 'opening', 'film', 'brief', 'summation', 'events', 'have', 'occurred', 'first', 'film', 'short', 'bio', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'disappointed', '*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'killed', 'off', 'main', 'character', 'Duke', 'understood', 'was', 'plot', 'point', 'help', 'serve', 'motivation', 'characters', 'story.I', 'understand', 'Hollywood', 'business', 'go', 'where', 'best', 'value', 'money', 'said', 'biggest', 'disappointment', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'story', 'moved', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'South', 'Carolina', 'nuclear', 'summit', 'world', 'leaders', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'South', 'Carolina', 'have', 'visited', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'dismayed', 'see', 'was', 'not', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'featured', 'film', 'instead', 'was', 'Fort', 'Pike', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Louisiana', 'Again', 'get', 'Louisiana', 'probably', 'afforded', 'Hollywood', 'best', 'price', 'break', 'film', 'there', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'had', 'story', 'least', 'be', 'adjusted', 'reflect', 'was', 'not', 'Fort', 'Sumter', 'were', 'going', 'to.All', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'summer', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'explosions', 'deliver', 'advertised']",N/A

From a fan's point of view I can see how this movie may be a disappointment for them.

If you enjoy action movies that have to be a bit more believable or movies outside this genre. Then look elsewhere.Better than the first but still needs work:The first movie was terrible because 1. Just about every character looked ridiculous. 2. Had unbearably poor acting. 3. The story and direction was unbelievable or uninteresting.In this movie they must have listened to someone's criticism because they reworked those flaws and tried. I can tell they fixed a lot of it but couldn't resist keeping something from those three flaws. So it is not perfect but at least it was better. I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it so I will probably rent it one more time. I don't think it is worth owning because it may be added to netflix soon along with the other B movies.

1480991,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B005LAII44,D. S. Thurlow,"[155, 190]","Let's be clear that ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation"" is an action movie based on a comic book and a toy action figure.  It features virtually non-stop action, some terrific special effects, and a comic book plot.  This is not ""Patton"" or ""The Ten Commandments"" or even ""Die Hard.""  It is a fun, no-brainer movie in which the good guys eventually win and the bad guys eventually lose, but some of the bad guys escape to set up the next movie.As the movie opens, the GI Joes, an elite American special operations combat unit, are in action, securing some loose Pakistani nuclear weapons from insurgents in a superb action sequence inside a military facility.  However, the Joes are framed by the President, who is really an impersonator planted by the terrorist organization Cobra.  The fake President sends a military strike after the Joes, wiping out the unit.  The Cobra organization liberates its imprisoned leader and executes its clever plan to take over the world.Fortunately, three of the Joes survive the ambush in Pakistan.  Led by Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, they go underground, figure out the frame-up, and make contact with two key people: the ninja warrior Snake Eyes and a retired Joe, General Coulton.  Together, they will put together a plan to ambush Cobra at a nuclear weapons summit at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, of all places.The action sequences are quite good, including shoot-em-ups in Pakistan and at Fort Sumter, and a fantastic ninja sequence on a cliff in some remote and unnamed mountain range.  Bruce Willis has an excellent extended cameo as General Coulton, while Jonathan Pryce enthusiastically chews the scenery as a real and fake president.""G.I.

1480998,AYG1U47VFZ165,B005LAII44,"E. Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[0, 0]","I&#8217;m one of the rare few who actually had an awful lot of fun with G.I. JOE &#8211; THE RISE OF COBRA.  I thought &#8211; like most truly good summer fare &#8211; it was a motion picture that set out with modest ambitions knowing full well what it was going to be: little more than a popcorn flick, with enough action and goofy goodness thrown in to keep minds busy while wasting a few brain cells on mindless adventure.  It kinda/sorta evoked in me that same gee-willikers sense of fun and camaraderie that the very first STAR WARS (since retitled to STAR WARS: EPISODE IV &#8211; A NEW HOPE) did when I was a sprite.  You had obvious heroes; you had obvious villains; and you knew that &#8211; once they met &#8211; there were going to be plenty of explosions.To my dismay, G.I. JOE &#8211; RETALIATION really shirked that original formula in favor of watered-down blandness.Now &#8211; to be fair &#8211; I know that there was some scuttlebutt back during its production about the studio wanting to do reshoots in order to beef up Channing Tatum&#8217;s role once he emerged as some cinema wunderkind for his part in crafting MAGIC MIKE (a narrative that had zero relation to the G.I. JOE universe that I could fathom).  Stupid is as stupid does, as they say, and RETALIATION couldn&#8217;t have changed all that much as Channing&#8217;s Duke disappears somewhat early in the picture.  In as a more-than-suitable replacement leading man / action hero is Dwayne &#8216;The Rock&#8217; Johnson, someone whose penchant for fisticuffs and kid-friendly machismo makes him a perfect contender.  He does what he can here, but, still, I can&#8217;t help but admit my disappointment with this JOE.The story picks up some time after the events of COBRA (for example, Destro and Cobra Commander have been captured and locked away in some secret black prison), and only StormShadow and Snake Eyes return to solid roles from the first picture, along with screen veteran Jonathan Pryce as the kinda/sorta U.S. President and kinda/sorta villain-in-disguise Zartan (who is also played again by regular screen heavy Arnold Vosloo).  Otherwise, vast and deep budget cuts have reduced the Joes from having their own private subterranean command center / zip code to basically one battalion of sweaty and muscled combat soldiers (mostly without all the great nicknames like SparrowButt and DeadEyeJake and Dunderhead).  Now, Zartan and Cobra Commander have launched a campaign to rid the world of nukes (???) because they&#8217;re secretly got an even bigger weapon up their orbital sleeves.  In a single stroke, they pretty much wipe out the Joes, leaving Johnson&#8217;s RoadBlock and two others heading back to the United States where they&#8217;re hoping to find an ally with their group&#8217;s founder, General Joe Colton (a predictable but reliable Bruce Willis).Unlike COBRA, RETALIATION is really dumbed down &#8230; and not in a good, wholesome way.  As I said, the first flick held its aspirations in check, but this go &#8216;round feels like it was a script left over from, say, some unproduced episode of POWER RANGERS (another kid-friendly property).  There&#8217;s never any real sense of intrigue like the first picture, and I can&#8217;t help but blame much of it on the cookie-cutter script by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.  They&#8217;ve both done vastly better things with other properties, but so much of this story feels like it was originally envisioned as a TV-movie-of-the-week or some direct-to-DVD franchise.  Either way, director John Chu &#8211; a talent with little to no background in actioners (much of his resume are teenage pop concert films or dance flicks (???) &#8211; didn&#8217;t do the franchise any favors except for being a much more affordable choice than Stephen Sommers ever was.WATCHABLE BUT DISAPPOINTING is the best I can say for G.I. JOE &#8211; RETALIATION.  There are some nice action sequences (i.e. the mountaintop sequences though entirely implausible work like great video game fun, and who doesn&#8217;t like watching a marauding tank destroy things?, etc.), but this JOE let &#8216;Merica down.

1481023,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B005LAII44,FNDNreview,"[14, 24]","When the first live action G.I. Joe film, The Rise of Cobra, hit theaters in 2009, it was met with a high amount of negative criticism - and with good reason.  For many of us, G.I. Joe cartoon and action figures were a memorable part of our childhood, so it's only natural to be protective of a film that carries the name G.I. Joe - yet bared little resemblance to the characters associated with it.  Nearly four years later, a whole lot has changed in the world.  Suddenly, Channing Tatum, who played Duke in the first film, has become a household name.  His popularity has catapulted him into several starring roles, but The Rise of Cobra was still bad enough to go with the decision to gut the entire cast from the first film (partially including Tatum) and starting fresh with a new cast.  In the sequel, G.I. Joe Retaliation, Dwayne Johnson takes the reigns.Directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D & Justin Bieber: Never Say Never), G.I. Joe Retaliation stars Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, the new leader of the G.I. Joes.  Disguised as the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce), Zartan launches an assault on the G.I. Joes, wiping most of them out, including their leader, Duke (Channing Tatum).  Now, Roadblock is forced to take command and lead the remaining Joes, including General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), and Flint (D.J. Cortona) against the newly freed Cobra Commander (Luke Bracey) and his nuclear weapon-wielding army.  Lee Byung-hun, Ray Stevenson, and Arnold Vosloo also star in supporting roles.Let's jump right into this and start with the bad news first.  For months now, the rumor was Channing Tatum's character, Duke, was gettin' the ax early on in Retaliation.  Of course, Tatum is a popular guy these days, so early test screen audiences didn't handle his early demise  very well, which allegedly forced the delay of the film (with the guise of needlessly and pointlessly converting the film to 3D), thus leading to additional Tatum scenes.  In any event, Tatum still bites the dust early on in the film, right when all hell breaks loose.  His poorly written death (which is clearly evident in the trailer) is one of the most disappointing scenes of the film, even though it sets the ""retaliation"" theme into high gear.Unfortunately, this sequel still follows a similar plot-line as its predecessor (ending in the same uneventful fashion) - thus bringing up some pretty bad memories in the process.  The Rise of Cobra dealt with Cobra being in control of a horrific weapon that could destroy a city, which eventually led to the destruction of France.  And, in the sequel, here we are again with Cobra in control of nuclear weapons, which eventually leads to the destruction of another major worldly city.  The action in these films is great, but at some point you'd think these writers would find something better to do than destroy cities.  For all the excitement within this film, it's still the bothersome repetitiveness that stands out.  And, speaking of standing out - James Carville makes a cameo, but still no Sergeant Slaughter?  Come on, man.Despite its lows, G.I. Joe Retaliation has a few highs, and it starts with the ensemble cast.  Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, who seems to be everywhere these days, takes command of the Joes with his usual ""boots to asses"" mentality.  Johnson provides a magnetic charm, especially in his scenes with Tatum.  The chemistry between the pair made for some good, light-hearted laughs and it's a shame it didn't last longer.  With Tatum out of the picture, The Rock is now the clear-cut leader, displaying the enthusiasm and powerful leadership qualities needed to command a high profile cast of this caliber, which includes action guru Bruce Willis, along with Adrianne Palicki, and D.J. Cotrona.  Together, these characters come out guns a blazin' - providing a ton of action using some pretty high tech gismos, and a pretty agile tank.The bottom line is this film's franchise is a mess.  Still, Retaliation is superior to The Rise of Cobra (although, it didn't take much).  Even though Retaliation features a new cast, the film still suffers from the same outstanding problems of the original:  plot direction and character development.  It would have been nice to see some more continuity in the script, other than the return of two silent ninjas (with relatively meaningless roles) and a brief appearance by Channing Tatum.  Seriously, would it have killed them to bring back Joseph Gordon-Levitt?  Regardless, if you're a true G.I. Joe supporter, go see the film - but if you aren't, and you weren't a fan of the first film, there's still not a whole lot more to see here.Overall Film Grade:  CFNDNreview.com",2,"Action-packed, but

Joseph Evans,"[0, 2]","****SPOILER ALERT****I was a fan of the original movie, even though many who claimed they hated it, actually enjoyed it alot more than they let on (the box-office returns don't lie!)The first movie was a not-too serious fantasy actioner with the occasional cheesy nod & wink to both the cartoon and toy line from the `80s. Even when our heroes or world civilians were in peril, there was a light-hearted, fun tone that flowed throughout the movie. Unfortunately, that tone is now completely gone from this movie.Apparently the studios listened to the critics a little too much this time around, since they gutted what was a potentially fun action-fantasy franchise and made this film into nothing more than a generic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson/Bruce Willis action movie.Gone are pretty much all the characters from the first movie, except for the two main villans, played by different actors this time around, which didn't really matter since their screen time is limited to about five minutes in the entire movie. Even perennial under-actor Channing Tatum (the man cannot emote!), playing the ""main"" G.I. Joe character Duke, is killed off on-screen front and center within the first 20 minutes of the film. After that, the downward spiral continues. There are no more grand G.I. Joe or Cobra base sets or cool nano-mite or pulse-shock weaponry that we saw in the first film.The characters are now very generic and boring, and just there to connect each cut/paste quick edit action sequence to the next. Since you don't care about anyone in the movie, it just goes on and on and on. After the first 30 minutes, my movie companion and I both found ourselves watching the clock to see when it would end.

1481063,A2HD1FY51FM1TW,B005LAII44,Grimluke,"[1, 1]","When I heard that this movie was more accurate than the first, I became very excited. I have been a fan of G.I. Joe for years, and while I did like the Rise of Cobra, I still couldn't help but feel like they could've done better. This movie satisfies my desire for accuracy better than the first, but still fails to make an overall high-quality action movie.Story: The Joes are framed for a crime they didn't commit (Renegades, anyone?), and most of their men have been killed in a desert ambush. Plus, Zartan, who is disguised as the President, freed Cobra Commander from prison. And, hey! Storm Shadow's alive! Why not bring him back with no good reason? Anyways, I didn't like how they had some major plot holes like the one I just mentioned and the fact that Duke and Snake Eyes are the only Joes who returned from the first film. So I'd say the plot is merely okay. It was not done as well as in this film as it was in G.I. Joe Renegades (which is probably my favorite version of the Joes. Check it out!)Acting: It's really hit-or-miss. Channing Tatum (who I thought was okay in the first one) was very good in this film. He brought great honor to my favorite character (Duke). Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson was pretty good as Roadblock, and Bruce Willis was pretty much perfect as Joe Colton (they should've given him more screen time, though). Cobra Commander has a new actor, which doesn't matter much since the majority of the film he's wearing a mask, and unfortunately his voice is still deep. It doesn't bother me much, though, because his costume is so much like the old cartoon and figures (as opposed to the first movie). Jonathan Pryce is also pretty good as the President (and Zartan playing the President), and Ray Stevenson's Firefly is very good as well. Now it's time to go into the negatives of the acting. Lady Jaye's and Flint's acting are not noteworthy, while Blind Master and Jinx have just down-right bad acting.Writing: Dialogue is okay I guess. I found the dialogue between Duke and Roadblock to be very entertaining, but the rest is pretty basic.Action: The action scenes are more realistic and cooler than those of the first movie. You won't be watching CGI robotic suits running around Paris doing the fighting for the main characters. These felt more like what I wanted in a live-action G.I. Joe movie. My only problems were that they're weren't as frequent as I thought they would, and that Snake Eyes' suit was so bulky that he wasn't as fast or skilled as he was in the first.Special Effects: Good enough. There weren't any eye-popping moments like in the Transformers movies, but there weren't any ugly moments like in the first G.I. Joe.Costumes: The Joes are wearing camo, Firefly looks accurate enough to the original, the Cobra soldiers actually bear the Cobra logo on their uniforms, and Cobra Commander looks a lot like Cobra Commander. The only complaint that I see is in Snake Eye's uniform (it's really bulky). The costumes may be one of the best parts!In the end, It's a really good G.I. Joe movie... just not a very good movie.

Of course now if the old cartoons are viewed through the eyes of an adult they're quite silly but as a child they were taught thrillers full of peril and intrigue.The film starts off right by introducing a real sense of peril that was so lacking in Rise of Cobra. When you see a main character dramatically killed off then all of the following action sequences have actual peril because there's some chance that major characters might get killed off. From a nostalgic point of view this was a success as I can still remember Duke's horrifyingly grisly death in the old cartoon.The 80's ninja action is in full effect with one of the most thrilling ninja fights I've ever seen. The Himalayan mountain top zip line fight is well executed and was enjoyable for any action film fan.Did someone give Bruce Willis a coffee? Bruce Willis seemed to actually be awake for this one, his role is small but well done and is reminiscent of his early work standing in stark contrast with the last four or five of his films where he seemed to be sleepwalking.Compared to most action films in recent memory Retaliation hold its own and is as good or better than the past 10-20 action films I've seen.

1481074,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAII44,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","So the other day I went to the Museum of Better Luck Next Time, that notorious repository devoted to failed ventures. There, I eyeballed mothballed exhibitions of the Betamax, the lambada, the last batch of M. Night Shyamalan movies, and broccoli. Halfway thru the door, two sweaty porters were hauling in G.I. Joe: Retaliation but were arguing about whether it's earned a place in the museum. After all, one porter argued, it cut an impressive swath in the box office. The other porter retorted that it was a critical disaster. Turned out these guys were lost. Minutes later I saw them hauling the thing into the Museum of Soulless But Profitable Enterprises.G.I. Joe: Retaliation is both a reboot and a direct sequel, but probably it's not worth your time to mull over that bit of conundrum. Gone are those faux-future tech battle suits. Gone is the onscreen blight that is a Wayans. Really, there's no point in comparing The Rise of Cobra with Retaliation and which is the better film. They're both guilty pleasures. They both sort of suck. But which one sucks less? Me, I prefer the cartoons. I even prefer that YouTube clip of Destro and the Baroness practicing the clarinet.We see the fallout to a cliffhanging plot thread from The Rise of Cobra. It's been what? - months since that master of disguise, Zartan, supplanted the American President (Jonathan Pryce), took over his face, assumed his role. It was only a matter of time before Zartan set into motion a chain of events that would neutralize (and disgrace) the G.I. Joes and set free the incarcerated Destro and Cobra Commander. At 0600, in northern Pakistan, in the Indus Valley Desert, the Joes are presumed K.I.A. But not so fast. They should've been more thorough. Now, the remnants of America's most elite fighting unit must turn to the reclusive General Joe Colton (Willis), the original Joe himself. Yippee-ki-yay.If your name is Marvin, you can't be blamed for assuming a codename... like Roadblock. We're right away introduced to Sgt. Marvin F. Hinton a.k.a. Roadblock (the Rock), right-hand man to Captain Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum). Their bust-your-chops bromance is one of the film's highlights for me. The Rock has got such a big personality, he translates to instant watchability and immediately boosts the film's energy level.I like the additions of Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Jinx (Elodie Yung). I still wish Sgt. Slaughter had made it into the movie, but Hasbro and Mattel just weren't able to work out a settlement. It's a sprawling cast, so maybe it can't be helped that the narrative is so scattershot. There's a lot of plot going on, probably too much, as it shifts from this and that thread. Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow get mired in ninja drama. It's not fair for a dumb, loud, big budget action film to expect us to use our brains. I had already parked mine.The discriminating critic will cringe all the live long day. An ounce of forgiveness is a must if you want to enjoy this one. Yes, Bruce Willis sleepwalks in his role. Yes, RZA bollocks it up as Blind Master, and never mind that he's a tremendous devotee of wushu cinema. Yes, the whiplash plotting may get under your skin. But there's the wicked ninja action brought about by Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun), and Jinx. Omigosh, Snake Eyes and Jinx fighting Cobra troopers on the mountain side! It's a cool combat sequence that was inspired by Larry Hama's famous silent issue of the 1980s G.I. Joe Marvel comic. And there's Adrianne Palicki's gorgeous-ing it up in spots and you can see why she was tapped as Wonder Woman. And Flint's mastery of parkour. And, again, the Rock. The cast alone - despite Willis' phoning it in - improves the viewing experience from The Rise of Cobra. The action beats are still absurd, and that's the fun of it. Maybe the action would've wowwed me more, but I just saw The Raid 2 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But Retaliation, more so than The Rise of Cobra, captures the aesthetic of the classic cartoon show. Overall, I got what I wanted out of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, a soulless, profitable movie.

We both really enjoyed the movie, it was action packed and a lot of fun! I enjoyed the movie overall, but my favorite of it was seeing what developed with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.  I don't want to say too much on that account, just watch the movie for yourself.The actors all did a good job in the film, and it was a joy to see Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock and Bruce Willis as General Colton.  I was glad to see Flint and Lady J in the film too, as I'd wondered why they were not included in the first film, though regardless, I did really enjoy the first film.  And as always, a joy to have Ray Park back as Snake Eyes and Lee Byung-hun as Storm Shadow.Now for the aspects of the film that I did not really care for, mainly involving the characters, or lack there of.  *SPOILER ALERTS* Firstly, although I know the director had or might have a purpose for it, I didn't like that they killed of Duke, especially considering he was a primary character in the cartoon series...just didn't sit well with me.  Secondly and primarily, what the heck happened to some of the characters from the first film?  I.e. Ripcord, Baroness, etc.  They all seemed fine and dandy at the end of the first movie?  Why did they just suddenly drop out of the picture, without us knowing what became of them?  I imagine that some of it had to do with the fact that they couldn't get some of the actors back to play the rolls again, but c'mon...give us something!  It was kind of annoying to me that they suddenly weren't involved in the 2nd movie, without even so much as an explaination on what become of them.  I don't know, maybe they'll make a return in the 3rd film, because you know they'll make a 3rd one, and then maybe we'll get some answers.  Growing up loving GI Joe and being a bit of a fan, this just kind of bugs me.All that aside though, with that exception, the movie is awesome and action packed and should suffice most action movie fanatics, whether you grew up with GI Joe or just a big time action movie fan, which I am both.

However, even a non-fan like myself has to admit the characters in the previous film and this one were nothing like the cartoon characters.  I mean, Cobra Commander doesn't have a very memorable voice in these films.  In the cartoon, his voice was annoying but very memorable.  I'm surprised they didn't stick to the cartoon voice for the fans.Okay, with that out of the way, here are some pros and cons.  First, the cons. The writing sucks.  The story is very simple, and it is not told well.  The previous film had some twists that made it a little more interesting, and since it was more of an origin story, I liked it more.  However, it, too, was a bad story with bad writing.  I did not expect good writing, though, so this is overlooked by me while watching most of the movie.  I just can't help but think the writers were undeserving of their jobs, because there are some extremely dumb plot devices in this film.  Also, the characters from the first film either did not show up or were killed off at the beginning of the film, so this series has no consistency as far as characters go.Now, the pros.  The film is action-packed.  There is a lot of high-flying, gun-toting action throughout the film.  That was the reason I bought it.  I like some of the action sequences.  Sure, the action scenes are poorly choreographed from time to time, and the ninjas aren't very stealthy, but it is fun to watch all the ridiculous action, anyway.  I mean, there are few films that actually offer this level of action.  Even The Expendables 2 left me wanting.  G.I. Joe: Retaliation simply gives me what I want and not much else.Overall, I give it a 3/5.  It is a terrible movie in all areas except action.  It doesn't hype the action, either, so unless you just want to see The Rock, sorry, I mean Dwayne Johnson, fake-fight a few times and see some ninjas running around with high-tech grappling hooks, this is not the movie for you.

1481145,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,B005LAII44,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[26, 42]","I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think Stephen Sommers's G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is better than Jon M. Chu's sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation and I believe Sommers is a bad if not terrible director. Let's move back for a second. Over a year ago I was hopeful and near excited about the G.I. Joe sequel. Sommers wasn't coming back and Hasbro along with Skydance productions added the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Bruce Willis, Ray Stevenson and Adrianne Palicki along with bringing back Ray Park and Byung-hun Lee. That along with a good trailer was I was hesitantly hopeful that G.I. Joe: Retaliation would be a step up from its average predecessor. G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra was a decent film that was major hampered by a poor script, with some bad acting mainly on the parts of Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum. I still don't understand the appeal of Tatum. Sure he's a good looking guy, but he's an average actor at best. With him originally not really being included in the sequel along with everything else there was hope for Retaliation. That was before Hasbro, Paramount Pictures and the rest of the studios involved decided to delay the film for nearly a year. Why because they wanted to cut up their already finished film so they could add more scenes for Tatum and to make the film 3D.All right let's get The Ugly.Channing Tatum: I've already said I think the actor is just not very good and his scenes in the film just seemed forced and I think anyone who sees the film can tell that certain scenes were added into the film. I am almost positive the scene early in the film with Duke (Tatum) and Roadblock (The Rock) sitting on the couch playing a video game. It seems like an easy scene the producers could have added and wouldn't have taken much time.Plot: It's not necessarily the plot that sucks it's the total overlooking consequences or continuum from the first film yet it's supposed to be a sequel. First there is Cobra Commander and Destro who were imprisoned in the Joe's main base which if I remember correctly was somewhere in the Middle East. Yet in Retaliation they're locked away in a prison in Europe, and let's talk about the prison for a second. I know with films like this you're supposed to suspend believe, but it just didn't make sense. The prison seemed small like it was only built to house those two and then there was the security. If you're housing two criminals who tried to and killed thousands of lives you'd think they'd be much more security. How did Tatum become the head of G.I. Joe and what happened to the main base. The film never mentions that or what happened to some of the characters from the previous films like Ripcord, Heavy Duty, General Hawk or Scarlet. The film didn't have to go into real detail, but at least mention where they are or what happened to them. These big flaws along with other in the writing took a lot away from the film.Editing: The addition of scenes forced into the film was poorly done. You can tell where things were edited out or added in. It's one thing to delay a film so it can be converted to 3D it's another thing to try to force in additional scenes after a film is already done. It certainly didn't work here.RZA: Who is RZA and what the hell was he doing in this film? That just didn't make sense and him playing Blind Master was just laughable.Jon M. Chu: Having Chu the director of Retaliation was one of the things I didn't like. He had only directed Step Up films along with Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. He's never done a film like this before and it shows. The action scenes while decent aren't well done and not better than the original. He obviously doesn't have any ability to direct real actors or filming action scenes.Let's move onto The BadSnake Eyes/Storm Shadow: In the first film these two stole the film with really good action scenes. In Retaliation the characters just seemed to have been force into the back ground and the plot with them was just badly written.The Rock: I like Dwayne Johnson he's a decent actor who has a great personality, but here in Retaliation playing Roadblock he was an empty shell of a character with no personality. The Rocks action scenes were well done, but that was it.Bruce Willis: The great action star would seem like a logical choice to be in a G.I. Joe film, but just like with the latest Die Hard film and The Expendables 2 it just didn't work. It just seemed like he was forced into the film and just a plot point. I have no doubt Roadblock and the rest of the Joes could have found out what Cobra was doing without General Joseph Colton's help and that includes weapons. Bruce Willis has certainly made some bad choices with his last few films.Let's move on to The Good (Yes there were few things I liked about the film.)Firefly: I loved the character in the comics and I thought Ray Stevenson did a good job portraying the character.Flint: I'm sure others will disagree, but I thought the little known actor D.J. Cotrona did a good job. Though Cotrona and Flint don't have a ton of screen time or character development I did enjoy the actor and his portrayal of Flint.Lady Jaye: Yes it's a guilty pleasure in that Adrianne Palicki is gorgeous and having her in a film just makes any film a tiny bit better, but here in Retaliation I think she did a good job. Palicki had a chance to shine as Jaye was one of the few characters to actually have personality and actual character depth. Adrianne's performance was good and along with her looks helped the film a little bit in my opinion.Well that's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of G.I. Joe Retaliation. Paramount delayed the film for nearly a year and what did we receive in return? We got back garbage with a poorly developed script, terrible directing, decent acting and action/effects. Overall I think it was a mistake to delay the film to force in more scenes with Tatum and convert the film to 3D. I would like to see what the original version of the film looked like. I bet it was and is better than the version the studios gave us. I highly don't recommend this film as a waste of money and time. I wish this film would bomb so the franchise could be rebooted down the road by another studio than maybe we and I could get the version of G.I. Joe that is actually good.",1,It's time the Joe's to retire so they can be rebooted a few years down the road.,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,6290,"['ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'going', 'say',

I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), our super-soldiers led by Captain Duke (Channing Tatum) introduce the pace of this movie with an action sequence against overseas enemies.  The down side: after a successful mission the president orders an air strike to kill the whole team and frames them for some pretty serious war crimes, painting them terrorists.  They lose a lot of good men.  But the best of them, thought to be dead with the others, made it out alive...and something smells fishy!What's that smell?  Well, it turns out that the president of the United States has been kidnapped by Cobra operatives, with one of them impersonating the president with some sort of nanotechnology that perfectly emulates facial structure and voice.  There's are first heaping spoonful of over the top.Cobra operatives' next step is to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander, who is in an underground super prison, and then bluff a nuclear coup to disarm the world's nuclear powers and then threaten the world with a new, special weapon of their own design.  Waaaaaaaaay over the top.  When you see the world leaders meet to discuss nuclear disarmament it feels like a 12-year old wrote out the drama.  But, I guess this movie is for the 12-year olds, too, so I'll leave it alone.Roadblock (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), freerunner Flint (D.J. Cotrona), the sultry Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Jinx (Elodie Yung) face off against Zartan, Cobra Commander, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Firefly (Ray Stevenson).  There's also a painful ninja clan cameo by rapper-filmmaker Rza, who reprises his woodenly stale performance from The Man with the Iron Fists. Bruce Willis also joins the Joes.The action sequences vary in quality.  I found the movie's opener to be a little weak.  But later sequences and, especially, the mountain ninja clan battle between Snake Eyes and Jinx and Storm Shadow's minions was quite good.  Likewise, a battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow along with Jinx training with Snake Eyes were also quite cool.  Leave it to the ninjas to save the day.  But they can't take all the credit.

1481159,A3F9VH8916IA40,B005LAII44,Jonathan &#34;Jimmy Dean&#34; Lane: libertari...,"[5, 11]","There are films that ask you to accept the premise before going in. There are movies that ask you to accept certain plot elements though they don't make sense. There are movies that ask you to shut your mind off and just go with the idiocy going on on screen. And then there is GI Joe. Nothing makes sense in this film. Not a single solitary thing. There's really nothing more I can say about it. It isn't suspension of belief that this movie asks of you, but the utter ejection of your brain into a little jar which you might hopefully get back when you walk away. I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. Once, a long time ago, I could. I still remember being very entertained by the first Transformers, so obviously suspension of belief to this level was possible for me at some time in my life, but I just can't do it anymore.The movie starts with a GI Joe par core fight scene, which I guess was supposed to be exiting but all I could thing about was The Office.[...]It really is that ridiculous. But to be fair, this is standard popcorn action stuff. I can forgive a movie its sins of over the top action, I have in the past, I will probably do it in the future. But the action in this movie never really excited me at any point. I can enjoy dumb action as much as the next guy (hell, I think I'm the only one in the world who liked Die Hard 4 after all), but GI Joe's was just too... Transformy. And not in the Transformer 1 kinda way, more like in the ""what in the name of God is going on here?"" Transformer's two kinda way. A small difference, I know, but even those who enjoy the first Transformers as a guilty pleasure want to rip our heads off at the idiocy that is the second movie. Transformers 1=stupid fun, while Transformers 2="" my God what did I just see?"" That's pretty much how I felt at the end of this film. A lot of bullets are thrown around, a lot of explosions, and a lot of crazy over the top action slock. But just about everything in it defines all sense of logic and reason to the point where I think the movie was written by the special effects people instead of, well, you know, actual writers. Did Michael Bay do this movie? No? Well riddle me surprised.But it's not the crazy over the top action that does this movie in. Despite my bad mouthing it, there were a couple of scenes I have to admit were really freaking cool. No siry, it's the complete lack of sense. Spoilers follow, so if you care about such things, cover your virgin eyes. So Cobra's plan to take over the world is, upon installing one of his henchmen as the fake President, to assassinate the Joe's with a massive military strike against their base after framing them for the assassination of the Pakistani President after using them to steal all of Pakistan's nukes which are conveniently all located in one central location guarded by people wearing towels (and no, that's not a racist remark, one of the dudes is literally wearing a towel on his head). So they launch a massive strike against the Joes... and no one ever questions the logic behind this, asks why the attempt was never made to capture and try them, question the President's authority to straight up kill all the Joe's using (ahem) COBRA troops. Did none of the generals wonder who all those mysterious troops were? So once the Joe's are out of the way the next step in the plan is to gather together in one spot the leaders of every nuclear armed nation in the world in order to negotiate talks on nuclear disbarment. Once there he, launches his nukes at all of them? Okay, first off, North Korea is at these talks. What fantasy world is this? North Korea sitting down at the negotiating table to talk about nuclear disbarment? Balderdash! So the nations of the world respond by, launching every single nuke they have, AT EACH OTHER? Wait a minute, they weren't nuking each other, America was nuking them, why then would they nuke each other in response? So the fake President then destroys all his nukes with a magical button, an watches as all the other world leaders have similar magical buttons that destroy their nukes midair as well. But wait, what if one of them decided not to? What if, you know, North Korea or Iran decided, screw it, and let their missiles destroy America anyway? Then Cobra would be dead, and the whole plan would be for nothing. Yeah, way to go Cobra.END SPOILERS!You see, no logic. There are so many plot holes in this movie it might as well be Swiss cheese. Nothing in this movie makes sense. There's a part where a character takes out a handful of grenades he was hiding in a fruit bowl, a FRUIT BOWL. Golly, sure hope he doesn't have any company over for dinner. Wouldn't want any kid finding a freaking grenade while looking for a banana. I haven't mentioned a quarter of the huge gaping holes in this movie, and I think just the ones I listed are pretty bad.The acting is adequate for this kind of movie though nothing special. The Rock puts in a fun performance, while everyone else is... well, there. Bruce Willis was an odd character. He didn't really do much, just sort of gave the Joe's their guns for the final battle and helped out a little bit in that battle, but he is more of an extended cameo then an actual character. I mean it's still Bruce Willis, so you know he's a cool guy,  but it seemed like a role they threw in there to give the movie a little extra star power it didn't have before.So in conclusion, GI Joe is Transformers 2. Is it better than the first? I don't know, as I've never seen the first. Is it entertaining in its own right? That all depends on the level of BS you can take before giving up on a movie. I was somewhat with this movie all the way up to the point where the villains revealed their master plan, at that point I couldn't take it anymore. It had reached levels of ridiculousness m fragile little mind could not take. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed all three Transformers movies, know they are capable of suspending belief in the rules of logic and reason for an entire movie, and want nothing more than to see big huge action scenes. If that's you, you'll like this movie, and more power to you. If not, I'd recommend saving your money.Replay value; low.",1,Nothing in this movie makes sense.,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",2013,6233,"['are', 'films', 'ask', 'accept', 'premise', 'going', 'are',

1481168,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B005LAII44,Josh,"[0, 0]","I really enjoyed GI Joe Rise of Cobra. It was not perfect but it was a good movie. In an age where cinema gives the audience reboots, sequels, prequels, and adaptations, here are my thoughts on GI Joe Retaliation.Returning to the movie: Channing Tatum as Duke, Ray Park as Snake Eyes, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow(good performance), Jonathan Pryce as the President, and taking the role as primary villain this time around; Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. New additions include: Dwayne Johnson as Roadblock, RZA as Blind Master, D J Cotrona as Flint, Bruce Willis as Joseph Colton, and the beautiful Adrienne Palicki as Lady Jaye(yes she IS hot). The acting was not the best all the way through, but I do not always expect ""the greatest acting ever"" with a movie like this.The story line is actually quite fun, and there will be some surprises thrown your way while watching this movie. Occasionally, there are times when the script goes all over the place and it does have a few cheesy one liners, but it does have its undeniably funny moments including (spoiler) watching Channing Tatum play video games. The story may not be the best, but Retaliation does deliver the goods in terms of action, sound, and its core plan as a movie.As stated in my headline, I feel Retaliation is not entirely better than its predecessor, but it is a good feeling when despite the flaws, and major/minor differences, you still find yourself enjoying a movie for what it is. GI Joe Retaliation is likable as a sequel, and while i do feel improvements can/should be made, I see no problem with a 3rd movie being made.

Retaliation was originally to release on June 29, last summer but with the ideas mentioned above, Magic Mike and Ted both took its place and would had faced The Amazing Spider-Man a few days later and it would had killed the film despite they both going after the same audience, Brave from a week previously, Ted in its original July 13 release date and The Dark Knight Rises weeks later, which somehow made sense and now will end up about $400 million worldwide due to the 3D boost and the international popularity of the stars. Not bad for a film that was delayed by nine months and given mixed to negative reviews from the critics and audience members, something we don't see in a film everyday. Unlike The Wolfman which its problems began when the film was pushed away from its November 2008 release at $90 million and reshoot most of the movie while adding more money to the already $90 million and it never came out until February 2010 and became a box office disater both critical and financally and G.I. Retaliation made the better mistake by not wasting additional money reshooting the whole film again (and the 3D just payed for itself) than the Wolfman.

Joe the cartoons were back in the 1980s!This is much better than The Rise of Cobra, that film was a disappointment to the G.I.

1481247,A1R17YELPTSM5T,B005LAII44,MacJunegrand,"[7, 14]","I have to confess, I really, really liked the first film.  You decide if you want to keep reading after I give my reasons for it.  Most people tend to dislike G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra because it's not a faithful adaptation of the cartoon.  For that same reason many people dislike Dolph Lungdren's vehicle Masters of the Universe and Michael Bay's Transformers.  And it's a WRONG reason.  Why?  Well, because neither of those movies are actually based on a cartoon.  The licenses the filmmakers got to make those movies were from the toy lines.  The cartoons are adaptations of the toys and the movies are adaptations of the toys, but the movies are not adaptations of the cartoons.  That's why you can't expect them to be similar.  It'd be like complaining that Batman Begins is a poor adaptation of Bruce Timm's Batman Animated Series.  It's not, they're both different adaptations of the same source material.That being said, I think filmmakers could do a better job if they took a glance at what worked in the most successful adaptations of the source material and apply it to their own adaptations (riding the last example, I think it's pretty obvious Nolan took a good glance at the Batman Animated Series when he prepared to make his Batman film, just like that series clearly was influenced by Tim Burton's films).In any case, I really have no memories of the cartoon.  I sort of remember it watching it but pretty much nothing about it but the name.  The reason for it is probably that unlike for other cartoons like, say, He-Man, Duck Tales or Super Friends, I never got a chance to watch G.I. Joe reruns when I got older, so it's a forgotten show for me.  That allowed me to see The Rise of Cobra with a clean mind and while its value as an adaptation escapes me, I think it's a competent and even great fun action flick.  It's no less realistic than anything Arnie has done, and it knows how to mantain a good pacing.  And while it has a lot of characters, it does a good job of giving them all good screen time and something fun to do.Enter the sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation.  In case you were busy fighting cockroach men in an alternate dimension for the past year, you probably know this movie was ready to be released some eight-nine months ago and they decided to delay it to this year.  Three major reasons were given for it.  Actually, scratch that, only one major reason was given for it, the other two are either minor or speculation.  The reason they gave was that they wanted to do a 3D conversion.  The other reason that was barely mentioned was that since one of the only four actors to come back for the sequel (five if you count CGI Arnold Vosloo's half-face), Channing Tatum, had acquired some newfound fame, they wanted to film some extra scenes with him.  The speculated reason was that the studio wasn't happy with the film.Now, it's perfectly true that they did a 3D conversion.  I can't speak for its quality, though, since I watched it in 2D.  It's also true they added a few more scenes with Tatum.  And if the third reason isn't true, then the studio didn't actually watch the film.If you've seen the trailer, you'll notice that the basic gist of the film is that the old team (lead by Tatum's Duke) gets killed and what's left of the new guys (The Rock, Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona) need to team up with the oldest member of the team, name-giver Joe (Bruce Willis) to fight a returning Cobra Commander (not Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and save the world from his influence due to master-of-disguise Zartan posing as the president.Speculation was that the new scenes filmed with Tatum would be to reveal Duke's survival after his on-screen death but I'm going to spoil this for you because you need to know what the filmmakers wasted nine months on:  Duke dies.  He doesn't come back, his death is barely suffered and his name is only mentioned once after the fact.  No, the added scenes with Tatum were all at the beginning of the film, in which he sucks at playing videogames, sucks at shooting and sucks at making comebacks.  And he's probably one of the actors with more screen time.You see, this movie's choice of screen time for the characters is atrocious.  You'll go out of the movie thinking President Zartan is the protagonist, since he's the one we see the most.  Yet the rest of the characters have so little time on screen that I had to double check my watch after exiting the theater to confirm the movie hadn't last only half an hour.  I hadn't seen so many characters with so poor characterization since Mortal Kombat: Anihilation.  Hey, that's actually a great comparison.  Characters are on screen for a minute or two, do something and exit unceremoniously with little to no explanation.  Want to know how Storm Shadow survived the first film?  You're out of luck because he simply shows up and no one seems surprised.  Is Jynx a character you are interested in?  Well, too bad, because she maybe has two lines of dialogue and none of them are about her.  Are you excited for Bruce Willis showing up as a mentor figure for these guys?  Sucks to be you (and me), because he has maybe three minutes of screen time and all he does is give the Joes some weapons and shoot a couple of bullets by himself.And once you're watching the movie, they do the same.  They set expectations that are never met.  They show Duke and Roadblock being friends and the latter seems to completely forget about the former's death minutes after the fact.  They try to picture Flint as a loose cannon at the very beginning to completely forget about his existence in the middle.  They hint at a romance between him and Lady Jaye and that never goes anywhere.  They set a moment in which Snake Eyes is about to be seen as the culprit for his master's death and that is ignored instantly.  When introducing Jynx they mention she's related to Storm Shadow yet up until the climax they act like strangers the few moments they're together.So why three stars instead of five?  Well, to be fair, it's a visually appealing film.  The few action scenes it has are nice looking, if not as interesting as the ones in the first film.  There's a battle in the middle between Snake Eyes, Jynx and a bunch of ninjas that goes out of its way in increasingly ridiculous stunts to go for the classic ""bad guys chasing the good guys are taken out one by one by the environment"", but it's nice.  The Cobras' new superweapon packs a punch in a way that Roland Emmerich would be jealous.  Newcomer villain Firefly is interesting in a Metal-Gear-Solid-Boss sort of way but, like everyone else, he's underused.  His appereance in the film was crazily enhanced momentarily for me in a moment in which, I swear to God, a real firefly showed up in my theater.  I was ready to compliment the amazing 3D effect when I remembered I wasn't watching the film in 3D.  Jonathan Pryce is clearly having a blast playing President Zartan, and you either love him or hate him.  The Rock is still a great action star, and he does a good job with what little he has.  The new Cobra Commander looks very cool.  And Adrianne Palicki is really, REALLY hot.  She looked ridiculous in her Wonder Woman outfit, but in this film she's pure, delicious, sweet eye candy.  Heck, two stars from this review are for her presence alone.  That being said, her character has nothing to do.  There's the aforementioned forgotten romance and a half-baked backstory about her father, whose conclusion would be underwhelming if it was something that had had any sort of impact in the film.So yeah, count me as one who enjoyed the first movie better.  If I decide to get this movie on Blu-Ray I'll update the review to include info on the disks.  That being said, the only reason I would potentially get this film is Adriane Palicki in HD.  She definitely needs more exposure.",3,It's just meh,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,7848,"['have', 'confess', 'really', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'film', 'decide', 'want', 'keep', 'reading', 'give',

1481254,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAII44,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","I saw this film when it came out and wondered how it would hold up on DVD. The answer is quite well. If for some reason you don't know what G.I.Joe is there was a set of toys in the 60s that consisted of 12"" tall dolls for guys based on the military put out by Hasbro. But they really took off in the 80s when they were made only 6"" tall and came with all sorts of characters, gadgets, vehicles and their own cartoon show. If you loved those toys you're almost certain to love the movies, especially G.I.JOE: RETALIATION.This time around Cobra Commander is held prisoner along with Despero, both captured at the end of the first film. Commander's right hand man Zartan is posing at the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce) thanks to nanomites, microscopic robots that make him physically appear to be him. As the film opens someone has killed the President of Pakistan and the ""President"" sends the Joes in to capture their nuclear bombs before terrorists can do so.While this is going on a rescue attempt on Cobra Commander is in progress. I won't say much more than that so as to not ruin a few surprises here including the introduction of new Cobra member Firefly. Suffice to say it succeeds and the Commander is back in the saddle of all things evil once again.Now led by Duke (Channing Tatum) the team drops in to take out the base and capture the nukes. Along with Duke are Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and several other Joes. They succeed in their mission only to be bombed and shot by a group of Cobra helicopters. Only Roadblock, Jaye and Flit survive. Afterwards the ""President"" blames the assassination on the Joes and outlaws any remaining members.The three remaining teammates return to the states to find answers as to what happened. They know that the President was the only person with enough power to order their termination and set out to get more intell. Roadblock, now in charge, turns to the only man he trusts, the original G.I.Joe, Gen. Joe Cotton (Bruce Willis). If the team can get enough evidence to prove what is going on, Cotton and a few friends will help them save the country.While this is going on Snake Eyes (Ray Park), the secretive ninja style Joe, is out to save the honor of his dojo and capture Storm Shadow. Climbing the peaks of a snow covered along with fellow good ninja Jinx (Elodie Young), they capture their prey and head out followed by Shadow's evil ninja bodyguards. What follows is an amazing fight sequence along the face of the mountain from ropes that has to be seen to be believed.Once the Joes are reunited and sides are taken they are informed of what Cobra Commander is up to. As is always the case it involves world domination, blowing up well known locations and general mayhem. What it results in is a rip snorting good time filled with action, gadgets and those well love vehicles that fans of the cartoons and toys remember so well.The movie offers exactly what you would expect, plenty of non-stop action, some thrilling fight sequences, lots of things blowing up and all those vehicles I mentioned. The new characters like Roadblock and Gen. Cotton mix in well with the ones from the first film and the bad guys are just as evil as you would expect. Are there plot holes or things that make no sense? Sure if you look for them. But instead just go in looking for that action that you love so well when it comes to these characters and movies.There isn't a weak performance in this film. Everyone plays up to the standards you would expect for the Joe team and the bad guys. The effects that are on screen prove that this production put its money where its mouth was. By the end of the film if you aren't on the edge of your seat yelling for the Joe's to kick butt then something is wrong. You'll also find yourself witnessing something rare in films these days, an honest to goodness hero that can be looked up to. Granted, there is some rougher language used than in those old cartoons and people do get killed. But on the whole this is one action flick not to miss.",4,JOE RETURNS IN EQUALLY EFFECTIVE SEQUEL,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",2013,4075,"['saw', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'wondered', 'how', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'DVD', 'answer', 'quite', 'well', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'G.I.Joe', 'was', 'set', 'toys', '60s', 'consisted', '12', 'tall', 'dolls', 'guys', 'based', 'military', 'put', 'out', 'Hasbro', 'really', 'took', 'off', '80s', 'when', 'were', 'made', 'only', '6', 'tall', 'came', 'sorts', 'characters', 'gadgets', 'vehicles', 'own', 'cartoon', 'show', 'loved', 'toys', ""'re"", 'almost', 'certain', 'love', 'movies', 'especially', 'G.I.JOE', 'RETALIATION.This', 'time', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'held', 'prisoner', 'Despero', 'captured', 'end', 'first', 'film', 'Commander', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Zartan', 'posing', 'U.S.', 'President', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'thanks', 'nanomites', 'microscopic', 'robots', 'make', 'physically', 'appear', 'be', 'film', 'someone', 'killed', 'President', 'Pakistan', 'President', 'Joes', 'capture', 'nuclear', 'bombs', 'terrorists', 'can', 'do', 'so.While', 'going', 'rescue', 'attempt', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'progress', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'not', 'ruin', 'few', 'surprises', 'here', 'including', 'introduction', 'new', 'Cobra', 'member', 'Firefly', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Commander', 'back', 'saddle', 'things', 'evil', 'once', 'again.Now', 'led', 'Duke', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'team', 'take', 'out', 'base', 'capture', 'nukes', 'Duke', 'are', 'Roadblock', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Lady', 'Jaye', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'Flint', 'D.J', 'Cotrona', 'several', 'other', 'Joes', 'succeed', 'mission', 'only', 'be', 'bombed', 'shot', 'group', 'Cobra', 'helicopters', 'Only', 'Roadblock', 'Jaye', 'Flit', 'survive', 'Afterwards', 'President', 'assassination', 'Joes', 'remaining', 'members.The', 'three', 'remaining', 'teammates', 'return', 'states', 'find', 'answers', 'what', 'happened', 'know', 'President', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'enough', 'power', 'order', 'termination', 'set', 'out', 'get', 'more', 'intell', 'Roadblock', 'now', 'charge', 'only', 'man', 'original', 'G.I.Joe', 'Gen.', 'Joe', 'Cotton', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'team', 'can', 'get', 'enough', 'evidence', 'prove', 'what', 'going', 'Cotton', 'few', 'friends', 'will', 'help', 'save', 'country.While', 'going', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Ray', 'Park', 'secretive', 'ninja', 'style', 'Joe', 'out', 'save', 'honor', 'dojo', 'capture', 'Storm', 'Shadow', 'Climbing', 'peaks', 'snow', 'covered', 'fellow', 'good', 'ninja', 'Jinx', 'Elodie', 'Young', 'capture', 'prey', 'head', 'out', 'followed', 'Shadow', 'evil', 'ninja', 'bodyguards', 'What', 'amazing', 'fight', 'sequence', 'face', 'mountain', 'ropes', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed.Once', 'Joes', 'are', 'reunited', 'sides', 'are', 'taken', 'are', 'informed', 'what', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'up', 'As', 'always', 'case', 'world', 'domination', 'blowing', 'up', 'well', 'known', 'locations', 'general', 'mayhem', 'What', 'results', 'rip', 'snorting', 'good', 'time', 'filled', 'action', 'gadgets', 'well', 'love', 'vehicles', 'fans', 'cartoons', 'remember', 'well.The', 'movie', 'exactly', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'plenty', 'non-stop', 'action', 'thrilling', 'fight', 'sequences', 'lots', 'things', 'blowing', 'up', 'vehicles', 'mentioned', 'new', 'characters', 'Roadblock', 'Gen.', 'Cotton', 'mix', 'well', 'ones', 'first', 'film', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'evil', 'would', 'expect', 'Are', 'plot', 'holes', 'things', 'make', 'sense', 'Sure', 'look', 'instead', 'just', 'go', 'looking', 'action', 'love', 'so', 'well', 'when', 'characters', 'movies.There', ""n't"", 'weak', 'performance', 'film', 'Everyone', 'standards', 'would', 'expect', 'Joe', 'team', 'bad', 'guys', 'effects', 'are', 'screen', 'prove', 'production', 'put', 'money', 'where', 'mouth', 'was', 'end', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'edge', 'seat', 'yelling', 'Joe', 'kick', 'butt', 'then', 'something', 'wrong', ""'ll"", 'also', 'find', 'witnessing', 'something', 'rare', 'films', 'days', 'honest', 'goodness', 'hero', 'can', 'be', 'looked', 'up', 'Granted', 'rougher', 'language', 'used', 'old', 'cartoons', 'people', 'do', 'get', 'killed', 'whole', 'one', 'action', 'not', 'miss']",N/A

""Firefly"" is portrayed accurately,.... things they got wrong....killing off Duke (was pushed back 9 months so Tatum could get more screen time, what screen time???)...never happened in the comics, ""Cobra Commander"" & ""Storm Shadow"" leaving ""Destro"" to die,(what??)....no explanation as to what happened to ""Baroness, Scarlett, Breaker, Ripcord, & Hawk"" from the first film, Paramount was too cheap to bring back Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Marlon Wayans, & Dennis Quaid, but not explaining their fates was even cheaper!!, a line of dialogue would have been nice, but noooooo!!!...we are left to wonder, Sienna Miller in 2009 said she was paid to appear in three ""G.I.Joe"" films as Baroness, I guess she got a free paycheck for not appearing here, this is what happens when you put idiots in charge of a franchise like this, there are however some high points to this one that I will point out, Adrianne Palecki as ""Lady J"", simply beautiful, so much so that I am willing to forgive Paramount for depriving me of Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, the mountain top fight sequence involving Snake Eyes & Jinx  vs  Storm Shadow's guards has to be seen to be believed, a simply breath taking action sequence, the action set pieces are more this time around, the world leader's summitt meeting is to close to a terrifying reality when the president (Zartan) launches all of the U.S. nukes, forcing the other world leaders to do the same, all in an attempt to disarm the world & take control, all orchestrated by Cobra Commander, this kind of thing was always hinted at in the comics & cartoon, Bruce Willis appearing as the original Joe from the 60's toy line was fun, talk about a guy packing heat, the hiding places in his home is a home invader's worst nightmare, & Willis hams it up no doubt, all in all this one is more of the same, like the first film it is hit & miss, as I stated in my review of that one, you shouldn't go in with high expectations, or expecting Paramount to have learned anything from the first film's mixed reaction, but if you want some cool action/fight scenes, then this is your film, & Adrianne Palecki will definately keep you watching no matter what.",4,Like the first movie.....it is hit & miss!!!,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,2879,"['someone', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'cartoon', 'comics', 'plenty', 'say', 'film', 'versions', '2009', 'Rise',

1481292,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,B005LAII44,Mike S.,"[2, 3]","I say ""kind of"" because this movie more acknowledges the first movie than it does follow it.  It kept the main ending plot point of Zartan taking over the presidency from the first film, and expanded on the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow story a bit, but aside from that almost everything was different.  Most of the main cast from the first movie were not brought back.  That is not such a bad thing in the case of Marlon Wayans, but it is when talking about Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Eccleston.  Although they did leave open the possibility of bringing Destro back in what will inevitably be another movie in the franchise.The highlight of the film (as it was in the first one) were the martial arts sequences involving Ray Park and Byung Hun Lee.  Sometimes they were fighting each other, sometimes together, and sometimes on their own.  Wire work and special effects aside, they steal the show every time.  The mountain top ninja fight about halfway through the movie is worth the price.  The additions of Adrianne Palicki and D.J. Cotrona as Lady Jaye and Flint were fine, The Rock was pretty much his standard action hero persona, and Ray Stevenson as the other main bad guy Firefly was also very good.  Channing Tatum and Bruce Willis had what amounted to expanded cameo roles but were not around for long.You pretty much know what you get going into a movie like this.  A lot of action, shoot-em-up explosions and martial arts.  The movie looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray.  The special features are pretty standard, but nothing to write home about.  Chances are if you like the first one you will like this one.  Unless of course you are one who absolutely hate the idea of the cast turn over and abandoning much of the story from the first movie.  If you hate that idea or are just not a fan of the genre in general, then skip this.

People looking for a complicated plot, or complicated characters, or character development, or well scripted dialog, or logic, or science, or reasonableness please don't waste your time.  You get a sense for all of this right off the bat.  The president has ordered the ""Joes"" (that's what they're called) to go to North Korea and rescue some guy that is being held prisoner and return him to the U. S.  From the time the order is given to the time it took to be back in the U. S. A. took 7 minutes if I'm not mistaken.So goes the rest of the film as the ""Joes"" fight the evil ""Cobras"" who have managed to replace the president for evil purposes.  So we get lots of explosions, killing, fighting, shooting, stabbing, things getting blown up, chases, wrecks, crashes and did I mention explosions?  All within the PG-13 check list, of course.  So here is the good stuff.  There is a terrifically staged and executed scene where a pair of Ninjas (Snake Eyes & some hot chick in yellow) go up a frozen mountain to get one of their former compatriots (now a bad guy) and bring him back home.  There is some very tricky camera and stunt work involved as a horde of bad guys in red suits try to kill the 2 good guy/gal.  It's all very cool.The Blu ray transfer is very special also.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and is of demo grade.  The colors are beautiful and there is every color imaginable from bright yellow to red to some wonderful blacks.  The facial detail is remarkable.  Sweat, hair, pores all clearly defined.  It doesn't get any better than this.  The audio as well is perfect.  This time we have a Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and boy is it a doozy.  From the beginning to the end, all the speakers fill up with great, clear, perfectly balanced audio.  Subs will get a work out as well.

And of course Hasbro's biggest toy line is G.I. Joe. So it was a shock to everyone, and probably Hasbro most of all, when G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra did not do very well. I could muse forever on why, but what it boils down to is that the movie was sort of a mess and cost way too much to make. Against all common sense, Hasbro decided to trot out a sequel, and in the process they achieved a rare feat indeed: a good sequel to a mediocre film.Retaliation is a leaner film than its predecessor and I think that is to its advantage. While the first movie launched into crazy super-science right off the bat, Retaliation begins as a pretty plausible military thriller (albeit one with beautifully choreographed ninja fights, but still) and gradually works its way up to insane future warfare. As a result, when Dwayne Johnson's Roadblock (who sadly does not speak in rhyme) stages a one-man tank battle against a horde of Cobra H.I.S.S. tanks at the film's peak it seems like a really proper climax instead of still more silly action. What we do see of Cobra is more on model to the 80s cartoon as well, from Cobra Commander's outfit (shiny mask included) to their cartoonishly despotic plot for world domination which seems to consist of draping Cobra flags over everything and calling it a day.Please don't misunderstand- if the first film turned you off with its over the top sci-fi army games, this one isn't going to win you back. The McGuffin is a satellite that collapses London, there's a bad guy named Firefly who kills people with exploding robot bugs and has a motorcycle made of missiles, and RZA plays a blind ninja master who makes the heroes steal each other's hairs blindfolded for practice. Retaliation simply doles out the crazy in smaller, better-planned doses and as a result makes its moments of fancy seem special instead of dumb.",4,"Decent as a film, AMAZING as a sequel",1381622400,"10 13, 2013",2013,1983,"['Transformers', 'films', 'made', 'money', 'Hasbro', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'foolish', 'not', 'filmically', 'weaponize', 'other', 'toy', 'lines', 'course', 'Hasbro', 'biggest', 'toy', 'line', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'was', 'shock', 'everyone', 'probably', 'Hasbro', 'most', 'when', 'G.I', 'Joe', 'Rise', 'Cobra', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'muse', 'forever', 'why', 'what', 'down', 'movie', 'was', 'sort', 'mess', 'cost', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'make', 'common', 'sense', 'Hasbro', 'decided', 'trot', 'out', 'sequel', 'process', 'achieved', 'rare', 'feat', 'indeed', 'good', 'sequel', 'mediocre', 'film.Retaliation', 'leaner', 'film', 'predecessor', 'think', 'advantage', 'first', 'movie', 'launched', 'crazy', 'super-science', 'right', 'bat', 'Retaliation', 'pretty', 'plausible', 'military', 'thriller', 'one', 'beautifully', 'choreographed', 'ninja', 'fights', 'still', 'gradually', 'way', 'insane', 'future', 'warfare', 'result', 'when', 'Dwayne', 'Johnson', 'Roadblock', 'who', 'sadly', 'not', 'speak', 'rhyme', 'one-man', 'tank', 'battle', 'horde', 'Cobra', 'H.I.S.S', 'tanks', 'film', 'peak', 'really', 'proper', 'climax', 'instead', 'still', 'more', 'silly', 'action', 'What', 'do', 'see', 'Cobra', 'more', 'model', '80s', 'cartoon', 'as', 'well', 'Cobra', 'Commander', 'outfit', 'shiny', 'mask', 'included', 'cartoonishly', 'despotic', 'plot', 'world', 'domination', 'consist', 'draping', 'Cobra', 'flags', 'everything', 'calling', 'day.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand-', 'first', 'film', 'turned', 'off', 'top', 'sci-fi', 'army', 'games', 'one', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'back', 'McGuffin', 'satellite', 'London', 'bad', 'guy', 'named', 'Firefly', 'who', 'people', 'exploding', 'robot', 'bugs', 'motorcycle', 'made', 'missiles', 'RZA', 'blind', 'ninja', 'master', 'who', 'heroes', 'steal', 'other', 'hairs', 'blindfolded', 'practice', 'Retaliation', 'simply', 'out', 'crazy', 'smaller', 'better-planned', 'doses', 'result', 'moments', 'fancy', 'seem', 'special', 'instead', 'dumb']",N/A

Um...ok.SPOILER!!!!Yes, Duke dies, Channing Tatum's character. A lot of people complained about this. ""Duke Never Died!"" Actually, he pretty much did in the original G.I. Joe cartoon film, and did die in it's original version. Still, he is the one character (aside from Cobra Commander) that was any good from the first G.I. Joe live action film ""Rise Of Cobra,"" which really was just ok.The opening consists of introducing a few new characters while the situation with Zartan posed as the president commands a Cobra strike on the Joe's, in which most of them are killed. This is a pretty hard hit to start out a film with, but we see Cobra doing it's worst damage imaginable in this film, what they were afraid to ever do in the cartoons (for obvious reasons). This G.I. Joe movie is far more gritty than the previous one, which is by all means, a very good thing.We end up with Cobra Commander (the new actor is great) and others getting back together while Roadblock (The Rock) and Lady Jaye go and find ""Joe Colton"" who was the original Joe. Great!!! What ensues are various ways to question if the president is the president, and it leads to them confirming it.The president (as Zartan) literally begins a nuclear war, threatening everyone and then stopping his own while others do. He shows them a device that is like a nuclear bomb without fallout, and there are many in space. These satellites of destruction destroy London, and the vision of it is pretty creepy. A terrorist organization that actually suceeds? As Zartan says in the trailer ""This is what we have been waiting for."" No more cheesiness with nanobots or plots that never happen.Now, after this, we do get some serious plotline with Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes, that Storm Shadow was after Zartan for killing their ""master"", and was only working the other side to get close to them. People didn't like this plot point, missing that this is the same plot the character had in the cartoons and original comics. With them, you get the film's greatest fight scene, in which they fight a lot of ninja's up on mountains.The 3D here was truly impressive, and I am self-spoken hater of cheap 3-D conversions. This isn't one of them.So when the team is together, you can expect a lot of explosive fights with geniune G.I. Joe vechicles (which people complain is to sell more toys) that were lacking horribly from the first film. In the end, well, most turns out good, but there is a pretty nice opening left, even when a lot is closed up.I won't spoil further. This is 100x better than ""Rise Of Cobra,"" and a lot of the reviews are complaining about things they are wrong about, or are die-hard Channing Tatum fans (who, despite him being a good fit for the role of Duke, is not all G.I. Joe is about). If you do not want to watch a well-done G.I. Joe film-a good plot, lots of cool characters, a lot of fights and explosions-good guys mostly save the day, then stay away. Otherwise, jump on, because this film is about as good as one could make a G.I.

So did they have enough time to make the 3D worth our time and frustration (of GI Joe fans) having to wait even longer to see the movie in theaters?Absolutely. The 3D is very powerfully rendered in GI Joe Retaliation. This is not a half baked 3D effort as many of the earlier, hurried 3D conversions of films like Clash of the Titans' poor 3D. The 3D here offers unexpectedly outstanding dimension and depth in many of the cool action scenes, coupled with a generous amount of pop outs. It's been said the Snake Eyes scene was noteworthy (with Snake Eyes portrayed on the Blu Ray 3D cover), and indeed it is as the 3D gives that scene depth the likes of which are rarely seen in conversions.

Honestly, do we really expect epic greatness from a franchise based on a cartoon and toys? Really? Some products just are what they are. And if you've grown up on this like I did, and are honest, look back at the classic cartoon now. Like many childhood favorites, even those weren't stellar stories. But they were fun and silly entertainment. In fact, action cartoons didn't really get more ""mature"", if you will, until Batman and X-Men. I digress, this movie is based off of that, and primarily aspires to be that. You have tons of action, which I could tell they tried to take more seriously this time than the first while at the same time trying to maintain the fun of it for we who remember our childhood adventures. They also threw in cheesy, hip dialogue to look and sound cool. It of course doesn't always work, but look what you're working with. You'll either like it or hate it. I didn't expect anything monumental or groundbreaking. With that, it was basically entertaining but you won't remember it for any special reason. It's a living cartoon action movie. Isn't that all you should expect from G.I.Joe? I wish they wouldn't have killed off Duke though. Just saying. The acting was serviceable at best. Didn't seem anyone felt the need to really go all out here. The action was average mostly. Basically you've seen it before hundreds and thousands of times, save for a few clever pieces. All in all a basic movie made for fun. Anyone who dislikes this, I can't argue them. It's a take it or leave it proposition. I'm glad I at least viewed it once.

Terrorist leader ""Cobra Commander"" and ""Destro"" are already in captivity; ""Storm Shadow"" and ""Zartan"" are still at large. The story begins with the ""Joe's"" involved in a rescue at the North-South Korea DMZ and later during another mission they are ambushed, which sets the stage for an international conspiracy. The rest of the story is pure enjoyable, entertaining Sci-Fi fun, with improbable scenarios, plot holes, lots of fights and explosions, while keeping the audience guessing as to who is on which side. But it also features one of the most marvelous swashbuckling ninja fight sequences in years, at the 55 minute point of the movie, at a high mountain stronghold, away from the main `Joe' group, featuring amazing CGI, `wire' fu, great fight and stunt coordination, and breathtaking matte landscapes that rival the likes of the Matrix Reloaded: it is definitely worth the price of admission for just this 7 minute sequence alone. Great action, adventure fun in a $130 Million budgeted, expensive-looking movie which brought in $375 Million at the box office (the preceding film brought in $300M).

After watching the first one, I knew it would be one that I wouldn't have to think about too much and I was right.  It was a perfect action movie when I just wanted to zone out a little while my insomnia worked itself out.  That said, I was disappointed that the majority of the actors in the first movie were either not there or eliminated from the second movie. Growing up with the comics, we all know Duke was the main figure and the source of our nostalgia or at least it was for me.  I like Duane Johnson in low plot action movies but he just didn't cut it when I was geared up to watch ""Duke"" in action.  I did like the ending scene where his character resolved his friends' death.  (Probably still a spoiler but I tried to keep it vague and you can figure out what's coming pretty early in the movie.) It wasn't a memorable movie by any means and I will probably forget what it's about or if I even watched it in a few years.  However, it did the job entertainment-wise so I give it 3 stars.  It wasn't great. I won't buy the Blue Ray or the DVD.

The release of this action sequel actually coincides with North Korea declaring war on the South and the US, threatening the ""imperial"" west with nuclear annhiliation. Too bad, the G.I. Joes don't exist in real life, for they could have easily disarmed Mr. Kim within five minutes of screentime. That's exactly what's being depicted regarding the Pakistani atomic weapons and this is only one the various reasons this flick is too over-the-top and self-righteous for its own good.Tangling serious and very topical issues like terrorism, nuclear disarmament and mass destructive weapons in such a perfunctory way perfectly illustrates what's wrong with modern-day Hollywood blockbusters. The action's for action's sake, the threat, and be it millions of deaths, is abused as a tool to entertain popcorn-munching audiences who have deliberately switched off their higher brain functions at the entrance.It's been done countless of times before in action flicks, comic book movies etc. But as long as it's only about giant roving robots from outer space blowing up alien planets, that's fine with me. But it stops being funny when it's about real-life nuclear threats...pocking fun at North Korea (""Yeah, we can annhiliate you 15 times, not 14!"") and Pakistan, blowing up London without serving any real  purpose...it's dull, bland, lukewarm and shows a lack of any compassion and empathy for the upcoming victims of real-life nuclear disasters. I really feel bad for all those who might die in...come what may...I kinda feel reminded of that pilot episode of ""The Lone Gunmen"", the X-Files spin-off that somewhat predicted 9/11.

1481473,A39XQK4IKQF2WG,B005LAII44,Stephen Brusniak,"[0, 0]","Preliminary Comments...After checking in with his right hand man, Michael Bay... Mr. Lorenzo di Bonaventura ordered all stops pulled and gave the green light to use up whatever pyrotechnics had not been used in the Transformers franchise in this, the latest installment in the G.I. Joe saga.  Sadly... as has become the beaten path in Hollywood, I am sure that there will be a third installment.  Unfortunately, because they blew everything up with the materials they had in this film, future writing will have to take a hit... Not that it possibly could, as I think that I imagined more creative G.I. Joe scenarios in my childhood years than was stitched together in the editing room of Paramount Studios.  However, in fairness... if you like Dwayne Johnson's bulging biceps and Adrianne Palicki's over-promoted bosom coupled with overpaid cameos featuring Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum.  This is your film.The Stars...Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  I will always smell what The Rock is cooking.  He's had some decent films in his career.  Think Fast Five and perhaps Faster.  Let's all forget Doom.  As Roadblock, he turns in a decent performance as a leading man.  But, when considering what he is being asked to do in this otherwise disappointing big budget catastrophe, that's not asking much.  Again, not faulting him for signing onto the project... but, his acting certainly got no help from the writing staff.Byung Hun Lee.  Definitely a lot of potential for the Storm Shadow character... if the production staff would remove themselves from the set and say ""Byung, you are an awesome actor in your own right... just adlib/improvise.  It will be better than we came up with.""  Notwithstanding the monkeying on the part of director and entourage, he turns in an acceptable performance.  And if you're a lady, don't worry.  There are plenty of shots that would make even the most avid Wolverine/Hugh Jackman fan say ""Put a shirt on, for crying out loud.""Jonathan Pryce.  He's fallen a long way from selling me Infinitis and foiling Pierce Brosnan with his nefarious plans for world domination.  I can't complain.  He had to play two roles.  And he only had enough character development written for one.  Sensing a pattern here, yet?Adrianne Palicki.  Who?  You might be saying.  I don't know.  A few chaotic scenes into the film that come after an awkward slide show force-feeds you all the requisite information you need to digest the toddler-created plot, she becomes one of the faces hogging up screen time.  Critic's note here... in the interests of being somewhat impartial I should note that I did find her attractive.  That being said, I don't think that her acting skills had much to do with her role/part.  I would like to see if she could pull off a more serious role that didn't focus so much of John Chu's camera time on her cleavage.  But instead... someone, somewhere in the studio said... ""Hey, we have too many dudes in this film.  We need to add some ladies.  Otherwise this is just G.I. Joe: The Expendables.""Channing Tatum.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if you can really list him as a star in this film.  I won't mention why.  No, actually I will.  And if you still choose to watch the film, don't come crying to me when you find out that he's only in the first quarter (if even that) of the film.  If you're looking for more Channing action, go rent Magic Mike.  And then you won't miss him at all in the remainder of this film.Bruce Willis.  Or General ""Joe"" Colton who is the original inspiration for being called ""Joes"" even though he was never mentioned in the first film... at all.  On an aside, I think that Bruce must have bumped into Nicholas Cage at some point recently who informed Bruce that it doesn't really matter what the quality of the films is that you sign onto... you still get paid regardless.  And so, in an endless series of near fiascos, Bruce tacks this one onto his CV after turning in decent performances in films like RED and Moonrise Kingdom.  Please note that he will not be reprising classic Willis awesomeness like we saw in Sixth Sense and Die Hard (but only the first three).The Plot...Sadly, there were some fairly opportune moments for this fledgling story to leap off the pages of a teenage fanfic writer's high school notebook...  But, the team that Mr. di Bonaventura got together decided to selectively pick and choose what they wanted to lift from the first film and run with that.  I'm not sure that they realized a need to improve upon it and embellish it somewhat.  And, there might be more to it... like an inability to sign some of the talent from the first flop.  Err, I mean film.  But, I suppose when you have people like Christopher Eccleston snub you... you're probably not going to be expecting greatness out of this film.So... the actual plot.  Cobra is on the lamb.  They've been getting theirs handed to them because the Joes are super awesome.  This sounds a lot like Transformers.  Hmm.  But wait!  There was that hanging chad we left in Florida... I mean, that loose end from the first film.  Oh, that naughty Zartan.  Impersonating the President.  Then we take a turn from two-dimensional to one dimensional thinking when the writers decide... ""Hey, let's have the 'President' just eliminate the Joes... And it will setup the most epic revenge plot, ever!""  So what should we call this... hmmm... Retaliation?No guys, that's just what I'm calling my review after sending my $5 to Amazon to see it.Over/Under/My Recommendation...If you're really bored.  And you have seen just about everything else on Demand.  Give it a go.  Because obviously you're not in it for quality if you have rented that many films.  Otherwise, wax philosophically on your childhood years playing with G.I. Joes and watching the cartoons... which may have had better writing than this film.  In some ways, this film make the fanboys that produced AVP Requiem look professional, and that takes some skill.Bottom line... save your money.

1481474,AEZ4DZCUL021H,B005LAII44,Stephen,"[0, 0]","Okay, I'm going to start with a SPOILER ALERT....so, if you have not seen it yet, then click away from here.....okay......the movie was okay, but it had quite a few holes in it. For starters, how in the heck did storm shadow survive after falling into the arctic waters after his fight with snake eyes? I saw him fall into the water when the cobra subs were starting to bug out. Maybe I messed it in this movie, but I believe I didn't. I only see him at this ""underground base"" wearing snake eyes costume. On that note #2......Cobra Commander and destro were locked away in a maximum security prison under the watchful eyes of the joes...only to reappear in a European prison under the command of some idiot? This made absolutely no sense to me.....#3......The Joes were supposedly taken out during an attack. Where in the heck were the Joes from the first film? Where was Scarlet? Heck, where was Dukes partner in this movie? Where was the high-tech Cobra jet at? Where was Dukes girlfriend at after the first movie? Where was the general from the first one? (Dennis Quaid) UGGGHHH!! By doing this, the directors cut away several storylines that were developing. heck, I would have liked another Cobra Base to be in this movie!!#4......The President being guarded by cobra units yet I didn't see any mind control going on.#5......Cobra commander. I liked how he had his original GI Joe style helmet but still didn't seem to make a big impact.#6......Destro gets left behind...why?#7......Storm Shadow's master was killed by Zartan? WHAT?????#8......Duke getting killed off early.....I guess we will never find out about the ""baroness"" fateWell, it seems to me that the Rock and Bruce Willis want to get a paycheck....because Willis doesn't seem to gel into this type of movie. It's a little different then Die Hard movies.The movie goes on its typical role....the good guys track down the bad guys, the good guys find the true identity of the president, and then go for the rescue to save the world....One thing that pisses me off in these type of movies is how fast the bad guys get taken out, like the bad guys have no training whatsoever. These 5 just mop the floor with them too easily....and the enemy always seem to fall into their hands right at the most opportune times.

1481513,A3DZCNEU21MB6L,B005LAII44,"THowerton ""SHowT""","[4, 10]","If you're anything like me you saw the trailer to ""Retaliation"" with Snake Eyes and Jinx having a hack `n slash sword fight against a bunch of disposable red-clad ninjas alongside a perilous sheer rockface and you were like ""awwww yeah!""  And then you waited...and waited as the release date got pushed back again and again (presumably to make more room onscreen for Channing Tatum's G.I. Joe ""Duke"").  So was the wait worth it?  And does the movie deliver the goods?  Is it at least better than ""The Rise of Cobra""?  Let's review.First off fan favorites Snake Eyes and Stormshadow get more playtime this time around and we dive just a smidge more into their history so, coupled with their frenetic and exciting action sequences, this cinematic aspect of Joe lore satisfies though fans of these characters will still want more (at least of Snake Eyes).  Jinx, a female ninja with ties to both of them, also is an important crossroad connection for these two ninja brothers and her presence (played austerely by Elodie Yung) lends a bit of platonic heart to this testosterone-spewing slug out of a film.  Second Dwayne Johnson is on board as Roadblock, second in command after Duke.  Johnson has that piquant charisma that just commands your attention whenever he's on screen and that's true here but I expected his Roadblock to be a mean mountain hulk of a soldier with pure bullish bravado much like his characters in ""The Rundown"" and especially ""Fast Five""; while he has a little of this he is played up more as an intuitive soldier, a man to both have your back and be your friend.  I was a bit surprised by this but Johnson is easy to watch so terrific casting as far as I'm concerned!  And speaking of terrific casting Bruce Willis shows up with a nothing's-ever-so-bad-that-you-have-to-take-it-too-seriously General Joe Colton, the original general infantry grunt of this special ops group.  Willis (who doesn't seem to age, does he?) carries himself with his styled brass and insolence and is a good fit in the Joe universe.  And then there's Duke (Tatum) whose face on the posters just might bring in an extra cache of coin both here in the States and overseas.  (*SPOILER*ALERT*)  As you may have guessed, though, he's not in the film much.  I thought he was a bad fit in the first film, a little flat and certainly not commandeering enough as even a young Duke, but I actually liked him here and was sorry to see him disposed of so soon.  He and Roadblock have an easy way with each and some nice, comic moments together.  I didn't think that his inclusion would enhance the film and I was wrong.  (*END*SPOILER*ALERT)As for whether or not you'll see your favorite Joe or Cobra baddie that depends: Firefly rocks this film!  Zartan (playing the President) is the main baddie and he has a little fun with it.  Lady Jaye (very fetching in a red evening gown; played by actress Adrianne Palicki) and Flint are the other two main Joes that comprise the team and follow Roadblocks command.  Mouse shows up nimbly, and of course there's Cobra Commander but not much is made of him though so much happens because of him.  Unless you're extremely well versed in Joe lore you'll miss the few others herein but you will miss Scarlett, Destro, the Baroness, Hawk, and more as they're not here (or, in Destro's case, you won't hear from him).  The bottom line is that if you dig on Snakes, Stormy, Roadblock, Lady Jaye, and Willis' new turn you'll still be happy even if your favorite Joe doesn't make the roster call.So let's get down to the flint of it.  This movie is a fun booming action fest with plenty of hand-to-hand/ close quarters combat as well as firefights and big explosions galore that satisfies the popcorn muncher inside of me.  And that's the reason to see this slice of the Joe pie.  The formula of a small, tight band of militarized heroes with their backs up against the proverbial wall facing seemingly impossible odds is a winner that's just written into our DNA.  (No you won't be wrapped up in an intriguing potboiler twisty turny hard to follow story but it may surprise you as to how it takes its time to unfold; the story is simple--and simply revealed in the trailer I'm afraid.)  The action and the military technologies/ hardware are more grounded for the most part as is the overall tone of this film; largely, though not completely, gone are the fantastical elements from ""The Rise of Cobra"" thus giving ""Retaliation"" more gravity.  It's a much tighter script and storyline this time around.So in the end was the wait of delay worth it?  If they originally didn't have any scenes with Channing Tatum then I will say that, yes, the delay was worth it as his scenes bring us in quickly to caring for our heroes.  Does the movie deliver the goods?  If you're an action hound you should be pleased.  Is it better than ""The Rise of Cobra""?  Roger that, hoo-rah![My last couple of comments have to do with the 3-D and some of the scene compositions/ blocking, especially early in the film.  Yes the 3-D enhances the movie but not too much and there are a couple of scenes that show a noticeable downgrade that made me wonder if they missed something in the makeover; I would suggest that you don't really lose anything seeing this movie in the regular format.  As far as the scene compositions/ blocking goes, there are several points when we are given a POV of looking over a person's shoulder or around a person, where their silhouette takes up a good portion of the screen, and this is distracting to the point where you will want to yell at them to get out of the way!  A minor gripe but a gripe nonetheless.]",4,When rolling Snake Eyes is a good thing!,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,5639,"[""'re"", 'anything', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Retaliation', 'Snake', 'Eyes', 'Jinx',

1481517,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B005LAII44,Tim Janson,"[0, 0]","The central problem facing the G.I. Joe franchise is that while it is based on a toyline, comic book, and cartoon, it doesn&#8217;t quite have enough fantastic elements to be viewed as a comic book film.  Yet at the same time it has too many fantastic elements to be considered a gritty, terrorist war type of film.  Incredibly G.I. Joe Retaliation is even more over-the-top than the Expendables films, and that&#8217;s quite an achievement.  Not that the film is bad&#8230;it is significantly better than its predecessor, in fact.The Joe Team is called in to recover some nuclear warheads stolen by terrorists in Pakistan.  The team led by Duke (Tatum) is successful in their mission but while awaiting their extraction they are ambushed in military air strike, ordered by Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), who is impersonating the President of the United States (Jonathan Pryce) using nano technology.  Most of the unit is wiped out including Duke with Roadblock (Johnson), Flint (D.J. Cotrona) and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) the only survivors.Zartan as President announces an agreement with Cobra to replace the Joes as Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and ex-Joe Firefly (Ray Stevenson) rescue Cobra Commander from an underground maximum-security prison in Germany.  The surviving Joes return to the U.S. and seek the aid of General Colton (Willis), the man who formed the Joes.  Meanwhile Snake Eyes (Ray Park) is sent by the head of the Arashikage clan to capture Storm Shadow who is accused of killing the clan&#8217;s leader known as the &#8220;Hard Master&#8221;.  With the Zartan soon ready to meet with the other world&#8217;s super powers, the Joe team has to stop his plans before Cobra can gain control of the entire world&#8217;s nuclear arsenal.Ok, so the plot is a grand pile of hokum and nothing but an excuse for a couple of hours of mayhem, but G.I. Joe Retaliation is still a lot of fun.  G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra made the mistake of trying to include far too many characters of the Joe mythos and while trying to throw all of these characters onscreen it lost its story in the process.  Retaliation streamlines the cast focusing primarily on Roadblock, Flint, Lady Jaye, and Snake Eyes. Director Jon Chu seems to recognize this when Storm Shadow and Firely rescue Cobra Commander but leave Destro behind.The film features several dazzling set pieces and action sequences.  The highlight is no doubt the battle between Snake Eyes and Jinx and the Red ninjas while attached to grappling lines along the side of a cliff.  It&#8217;s a marvelous sequence that steps out of the usual martial arts type of fights for something that is fresh and inventive.  Roadblock and Firefly also square off in a couple of good, old fashioned brawls.  Ray Stevenson steals the show from the Cobra side of things as the ruthless villain with a penchant for pyrotechnics.  Since Storm Shadow basically jumps ship, Zartan is disguised as the President and Cobra Commander is, well, boring, it is Stevenson who gives Cobra its edge and identity.Tatum and Johnson have a great rapport and some fun scenes but unfortunately Tatum&#8217;s character gets killed off far too soon leaving The Rock to have to carry the action for the rest of his uninteresting co-stars.  Even worse is adding Bruce Willis to the mix. Willis no longer plays characters but simply plays Bruce Willis, smirking his way through every scene.  I wonder if he was getting a million dollars a day for this film.  Add to that we have some of the worst depicted &#8220;world leaders&#8221; ever and this isn&#8217;t an experience driving by performances.In the end, however, G.I. Joe Retaliation is harmless fun that made me long for the days of my G.I. Joes with the fuzzy heads and Kung-Fu grip.Blu-Ray ExtrasCommentary with Director Jon M.

The story unfolds in a not very compelling way. Cobra strikes back, framing the G.I. Joe team for assassinating the Pakistani president. Then the surviving warriors - Flint (D.J. Cotrona), Roadblock (Dwayne Johnson), Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki) and Duke (Channing Tatum) - fight back, with a help from General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis).

Joe: Rise of Cobra, so I was really looking forward to the sequel. I really did enjoy it despite having some difficulty with it.Pros: This movie has a ton of action, twists and turns and great character moments. The plot is very good and I like that they focus mainly on the fact that Zartan is impersonating the President. Dwayne Johnson is a favorite of mine as is Bruce Willis so it is really good to see them in this movie. This movie has great CGI special effects and they blend into the story, help tell the story, without overpowering the story. This movie could have easily turned into a CGI laden video game but it does not. I think the presence of Dwayne Johnson really carried this movie and the central theme of this movie is all about redemption. Although we see Cobra Commander and his gang of evil doers retaliate for the defeat they experienced in the first movie. In truth this movie is about the redemption of the Joes, The President and Storm Shadow. I found a great deal of heart in this movie.Cons: Although I really did like this movie it felt detached from the first movie in some ways. Maybe that has to do with the fact that so few of the actors from the first movie returned for this movie. This film introduces us to many new faces. Plus, this movie seemed smaller in scale than the previous film. Those two elements make the movie feel very different from the first movie. Although I really like this movie I could never shake that sense of this film feeling so different from the other film.I recently published a blog post that mentions how the tone of comic-book movie should be. G.I. Joe: Retaliation is a great example of a comic book style movie that strikes the right tone or verisimilitude. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It is not campy but yet the humor, the macho bravado within the film does let us know that this is going to be a fun movie...and it is. This movie is about redemption, friends and standing by those friends who need our help. The movie is also over-the-top in places with its action scenes but they are fun to watch. It is almost like watching an action oriented well choreographed dance unfold before your eyes.G.I.
