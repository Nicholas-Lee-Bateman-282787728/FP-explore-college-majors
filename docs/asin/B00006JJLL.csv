This DVD set gives you two movies, Mermaid in a Manhole and He Never Dies, of the two Mermaid in a Manhole is the strongest. I will however point out that none of these movies are over an hour long they are short films not feature length. Mermaid in a Manhole is a few minutes short of an hour if I do not remember it wrong, and He Never Dies is about 45 minutes long.Mermaid in a Manhole is about a struggling artist who is trying to deal with the loss of his wife by going down in the sewers and making surrealistic paintings of garbage. One day when he is down looking for new motives for his paintings he find a mermaid, the painter remembers that he had met this mermaid when he was a boy and the sewers where a river. It turns out the mermaid is very ill, having been poisoned from living in the sewer to long, so our hero takes her home and starts to make a portrait of her.He Never Dies is about a young man who is socially awkward, hates his job, get picked on by his boss and generally thinks his life suck. One day the protagonist decides to take his own life only to discover that he is immortal, he literary can not die no matter how much damage he takes. This movie have no story what so ever, it is just the protagonist cutting himself to pieces trying to find a way to kill himself and after a while trying to scare his friends by continuing the self mutilation in front of them.Now here is the problem with these movies, there are no story it is just gore. For both movies  could literary sum up the story in one sentence and all the rest is just blood and body parts flying. Now if you are a gore hound then I am sure you might enjoy this DVD set, after all Guinna Pig is the movie series that where called in to prove that their actors where still alive as the gore at times look so realistic, and especially for the time it was made that many though they where real snuff movies. Now however if you like me value a horror movie more for it's story than for gore then this movie set will not satisfy you. The gore effects are brilliant for it's time, but that is all these two movies are, gore, gore, gore. I found the movies boring after a while, they did not shock me and I found myself just waiting for some semblance of a plot to start, but it never did.Now, if you are a gore fan or a horror movie collector I do recommend this set because it is obscure and make a nice addition to a collection. I think also that if you are interested in special effects you might enjoy this as the creators of these movies have put allot of thought into making it realistic. If you however is looking for a scary story then this movie is not for you. The acting is bad, the story is non existence and in fact everything but the gore is awful, I do not care if this have a cult following, these movies are just not good.",2,"The gore is good, everything else is a boring mess.",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,3013,"['movies', 'have', 'bit', 'cult', 'following', 'might', 'make', 'people', 'angry', 'review', 'am', 'sorry', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'say', 'what', 'really', 'mean', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'movies', 'Mermaid', 'Manhole', 'Never', 'two', 'Mermaid', 'Manhole', 'strongest', 'will', 'however', 'point', 'out', 'none', 'movies', 'are', 'hour', 'long', 'are', 'short', 'films', 'not', 'feature', 'length', 'Mermaid', 'Manhole', 'few', 'minutes', 'short', 'hour', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'wrong', 'Never', '45', 'minutes', 'long.Mermaid', 'Manhole', 'struggling', 'artist', 'who', 'trying', 'deal', 'loss', 'wife', 'going', 'down', 'sewers', 'making', 'surrealistic', 'paintings', 'garbage', 'One', 'day', 'when', 'down', 'looking', 'new', 'motives', 'paintings', 'find', 'mermaid', 'painter', 'remembers', 'had', 'met', 'mermaid', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'sewers', 'where', 'river', 'out', 'mermaid', 'very', 'ill', 'having', 'been', 'poisoned', 'living', 'sewer', 'long', 'hero', 'home', 'make', 'portrait', 'her.He', 'Never', 'Dies', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'socially', 'awkward', 'job', 'get', 'picked', 'boss', 'generally', 'life', 'suck', 'One', 'day', 'protagonist', 'take', 'own', 'life', 'only', 'discover', 'immortal', 'literary', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'damage', 'movie', 'have', 'story', 'what', 'so', 'ever', 'just', 'protagonist', 'cutting', 'pieces', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'kill', 'while', 'trying', 'scare', 'friends', 'continuing', 'self', 'mutilation', 'front', 'them.Now', 'here', 'problem', 'movies', 'are', 'story', 'just', 'gore', 'movies', 'could', 'literary', 'sum', 'up', 'story', 'one', 'sentence', 'rest', 'just', 'blood', 'body', 'parts', 'flying', 'Now', 'are', 'gore', 'hound', 'then', 'am', 'sure', 'might', 'enjoy', 'DVD', 'set', 'Guinna', 'Pig', 'movie', 'series', 'where', 'called', 'prove', 'actors', 'where', 'still', 'alive', 'gore', 'times', 'look', 'so', 'realistic', 'especially', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'many', 'where', 'real', 'snuff', 'movies', 'Now', 'however', 'value', 'horror', 'movie', 'more', 'story', 'gore', 'then', 'movie', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'satisfy', 'gore', 'effects', 'are', 'brilliant', 'time', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'gore', 'gore', 'gore', 'found', 'movies', 'boring', 'while', 'did', 'not', 'shock', 'found', 'just', 'waiting', 'semblance', 'plot', 'start', 'never', 'are', 'gore', 'fan', 'horror', 'movie', 'collector', 'do', 'recommend', 'set', 'obscure', 'make', 'nice', 'addition', 'collection', 'think', 'also', 'are', 'interested', 'special', 'effects', 'might', 'enjoy', 'creators', 'movies', 'have', 'put', 'allot', 'thought', 'making', 'realistic', 'however', 'looking', 'scary', 'story', 'then', 'movie', 'not', 'acting', 'bad', 'story', 'non', 'existence', 'fact', 'everything', 'gore', 'awful', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'have', 'cult', 'following', 'movies', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'good']",Guinea Pig Mermaid in a Manhole/He Never Dies Double Feature

718422,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006JJLL,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Guinea Pig IV: Mermaid in a Sewer (Hideshi Hino, 1988)[originally posted 7Jul2000]Mermaid in a Sewer, one of the four Guinea Pig films directed by Hino, is the only one that rivals The Flower of Flesh and Blood in notoriety and popularity. Unlike its more graphic and brutal cousin, Mermaid in a Sewer (often translated as Mermaid in a Manhole, Mermaid in the Bathtub, or any other number of similar titles) actually has a plot to it. An artist, obviously modeled on Hino himself (Hino's style is unmistakable), draws his inspiration from things he sees and finds in his local sewer system. One day, what he finds among the muck and stench is... a mermaid . Yes, a mermaid. A very attractive one at that (and one is forced to wonder what, exactly, would motivate an actress to play a part like this...). We find out, after the two have conversed a bit and he's done a preliminary sketch, that she is wounded. He takes her home (how he gets her there without anyone noticing is beyond me) and installs her in his bathtub in order to take care of her.You can see where this is going, I'm sure. Wound + sewer = bad, bad things.I'd comment on the acting, dialogue, etc. if I actually understood Japanese. Sometimes watching films in foreign languages with no subtitles is good for the soul, I guess (though anyone who happens to have a script from either 2 or 3 in English who'd be willing to send a copy my way would be remembered in my will, and not with a debt). The couple who lives downstairs form the artist pop up every now and then to give what would seem a comic turn to the film, which only adds to the disgust and horror. If you get nightmares easily, this is not a film you ever want to see. As Joaquin Phoenix said in what was one of only a handful of lines in 8mm that's actually worth remembering, &#34;there are some things you can't un-see.&#34; I could never pop this tape into the cassette player again, and certain images would remain as fresh in my mind as they are right now. It's that bad. *** ",4,The creative urge.,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",2014,2013,"['Guinea', 'Pig', 'IV', 'Mermaid', 'Sewer', 'Hideshi', 'Hino', '1988', '[', 'originally', 'posted', '7Jul2000', ']', 'Mermaid', 'Sewer', 'one', 'four', 'Guinea', 'Pig', 'films', 'directed', 'Hino', 'only', 'one', 'Flower', 'Flesh', 'Blood', 'notoriety', 'popularity', 'more', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'cousin', 'Mermaid', 'Sewer', 'often', 'translated', 'Mermaid', 'Manhole', 'Mermaid', 'Bathtub', 'other', 'number', 'similar', 'titles', 'actually', 'plot', 'artist', 'obviously', 'modeled', 'Hino', 'Hino', 'style', 'unmistakable', 'inspiration', 'things', 'local', 'sewer', 'system', 'One', 'day', 'what', 'muck', 'stench', 'mermaid', 'Yes', 'mermaid', 'very', 'attractive', 'one', 'one', 'forced', 'wonder', 'what', 'exactly', 'would', 'motivate', 'actress', 'play', 'part', 'find', 'out', 'two', 'have', 'conversed', 'bit', 'done', 'preliminary', 'sketch', 'wounded', 'home', 'how', 'anyone', 'noticing', 'bathtub', 'order', 'take', 'care', 'her.You', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'going', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Wound', '+', 'sewer', '=', 'bad', 'bad', 'things.I', ""'d"", 'comment', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'etc', 'actually', 'understood', 'Japanese', 'Sometimes', 'watching', 'films', 'foreign', 'languages', 'subtitles', 'good', 'soul', 'guess', 'anyone', 'who', 'have', 'script', '2', '3', 'English', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'send', 'copy', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'remembered', 'will', 'not', 'debt', 'couple', 'who', 'downstairs', 'form', 'artist', 'pop', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'give', 'what', 'would', 'seem', 'comic', 'turn', 'film', 'only', 'disgust', 'horror', 'get', 'nightmares', 'easily', 'not', 'film', 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'said', 'what', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'handful', 'lines', '8mm', 'actually', 'worth', 'remembering', '34', 'are', 'things', 'ca', ""n't"", 'un-see.', '34', 'could', 'never', 'pop', 'tape', 'cassette', 'player', 'again', 'certain', 'images', 'would', 'remain', 'fresh', 'mind', 'are', 'right', 'now', 'bad', '***']",Guinea Pig Mermaid in a Manhole/He Never Dies Double Feature
718423,AVW6BHMTC9QS4,B00006JJLL,Spencer Wendleton,"[19, 34]","Mermaid in a Manhole isn't even an hour long.  Both movies add up to be about 113 minutes.  The gore is substandard and the plot is as good as what I see when I wipe my behind.  Let me sum this movie up: artist finds mermaid in sewer (that's the first five minutes), puts mermaid in tub, mermaid pops multi-colored pustules, artist paints her as she flops around, and artist cuts her up into pieces (very lame effects), and he gets thrown in prison.  The end and I'm out of toilet paper.He Never Dies keeps the lackadazical torch burning.  I'll sum this one up for you: sad man cuts wrists, stares at the wound, keeps cutting himself up, brother comes to see and faints, then the man who never dies is a talking head on a table.  That's it.  Is it worth thirty bucks?  Hell no, my friend.
