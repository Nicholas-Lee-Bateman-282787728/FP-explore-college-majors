647821,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B00005JPAR,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[1, 6]","New Age fairy tale, `The Fountain,' taps into our most primitive regions by transcending space and time to seek the antidote to man's mighty enemy--Death.  Drawing upon a hodgepodge of religious imagery, the movie intersects four time frames, including ancient times and the biblical Tree of Life; the trappings of Medeival Spain when ascetical practices were sometimes severe, and the Inquisition made ""heresy"" contraband; today, and the future when mankind potentially can reap the benefits of science and meditation.  In the middle times, the conquistador seeks the cure to death with a pilgrimage to Mayan civilization where the pyramid of life can be found and brought back to his queen.  In today's time, that same conquistador is scientist, Tommy (Hugh Jackman), seeking a cure for his terminally ill wife, Izzi (Rachel Weisz), through an experimental rhesus monkey.  The future looks good if only the past times can be linked together in one healing swoop. A plethora of myths connect the story and time differential. The book 'The Fountain' and an eaten lotus make portals to each place and time.Philosophically, there are no enemies in the movie but death.  In medieval times, Franciscan friar, Fr. Avila, lives in a time where he states, ""Bodies are prisons for our souls.""  In today's time, Tommy says ""Death is a disease, and there's a cure, and I will find it.""  Nice stuff.  Who can argue with the idea that death robs us of loved ones, ruins our plans, and creates muddying mystery beyond our imagination?  The movie tries to construct archetypes that pull for our desire to have everlasting life on earth.  Meaningful, the movie is great escapist fare that is cathartic--even if it has to take itself seriously enough to work.`The Fountain' demonstrates effectiveness in ways that Shymalan`s `Lady in the Water` failed to accomplish.  Each scene is shot with easily pleasing panoramic views, and Darren Aronofsky's direction gives the film an essential urgency.  Handled with good, performances by Jackman and Weisz, and an excellent performance by Ellen Burstyn as Tommy's lab supervisor, 'The Fountain' takes the edge off what could have been a disasterous fairy tale gone too fluffy and soft in the head.",3,Restoring Eden,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2224,"['New', 'Age', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Fountain', 'most', 'primitive', 'regions', 'transcending', 'space', 'time', 'seek', 'antidote', 'man', 'mighty', 'enemy', 'Death', 'Drawing', 'hodgepodge', 'religious', 'imagery', 'movie', 'four', 'time', 'frames', 'including', 'ancient', 'times', 'biblical', 'Tree', 'Life', 'trappings', 'Medeival', 'Spain', 'when', 'ascetical', 'practices', 'were', 'sometimes', 'severe', 'Inquisition', 'made', 'heresy', 'contraband', 'today', 'future', 'when', 'mankind', 'potentially', 'can', 'reap', 'benefits', 'science', 'meditation', 'middle', 'times', 'conquistador', 'cure', 'death', 'pilgrimage', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'where', 'pyramid', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'brought', 'back', 'queen', 'today', 'time', 'same', 'conquistador', 'scientist', 'Tommy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'seeking', 'cure', 'terminally', 'ill', 'wife', 'Izzi', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'experimental', 'rhesus', 'monkey', 'future', 'good', 'only', 'past', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'linked', 'together', 'one', 'healing', 'swoop', 'plethora', 'myths', 'connect', 'story', 'time', 'differential', 'book', 'Fountain', 'eaten', 'lotus', 'make', 'portals', 'place', 'time.Philosophically', 'are', 'enemies', 'movie', 'death', 'medieval', 'times', 'Franciscan', 'friar', 'Fr', 'Avila', 'time', 'where', 'Bodies', 'are', 'prisons', 'souls', 'today', 'time', 'Tommy', 'Death', 'disease', 'cure', 'will', 'find', 'Nice', 'stuff', 'Who', 'can', 'argue', 'idea', 'death', 'robs', 'loved', 'ones', 'plans', 'muddying', 'mystery', 'imagination', 'movie', 'construct', 'archetypes', 'pull', 'desire', 'have', 'everlasting', 'life', 'earth', 'Meaningful', 'movie', 'great', 'escapist', 'fare', 'cathartic', 'even', 'take', 'seriously', 'enough', 'work.', 'Fountain', 'demonstrates', 'effectiveness', 'ways', 'Shymalan', 's', 'Lady', 'Water', 'failed', 'accomplish', 'scene', 'shot', 'easily', 'pleasing', 'panoramic', 'views', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'direction', 'film', 'essential', 'urgency', 'Handled', 'good', 'performances', 'Jackman', 'Weisz', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Tommy', 'lab', 'supervisor', 'Fountain', 'edge', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'disasterous', 'fairy', 'tale', 'gone', 'too', 'fluffy', 'soft', 'head']",N/A

After a confusing start this movie bloomed into something incredible.  Really hard to describe in words it had such strong spiritual overtones than anyone who has faith will feel more enlightened.This journey begins in 1500 A.D. as the main character is a Spaniard in Ancient Mexico in search of Eternal Life.  It is said a tree possesses this power.  Although you are not really given that information at first it becomes evident how beautiful the cinematography is.The Fountain focuses around 2000 A.D. and the story of a doctor who is fighting to keep his beautiful wife alive.  It is not necessarily her physical beauty but that of her spiritual presence that makes her an amazing character.  Full of energy and life despite being stricken with cancer.  Her husband cannot accept this journey she is on.  Instead he continues to focus on some way to keep her alive.I watched the Blu-ray edition.  This movie is chock full of special features making much more of an experience for those who want to watch.  The picture is not superb as compared to other Blu-rays I have seen.  The audio for the most part is also average.  I believe all versions include the same special features.  I would say if the DVD version is much cheaper to get that one and watch it on an upscaled DVD player.The movies visual appeal also makes it confusing at times as The Fountain continually switches from past, present, and future.  The stories begin to meld make it more understandable.  What is left is an understanding over what life is really about.  This movie is not intending for everyone.

Almost everything in the movie can be seen as symbolic, right down to the lighting in each scene with transitions from darkness to light.

647831,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JPAR,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 1]","Without a doubt, Darren Aronofsky has subtly crafted the best film of the year.  With this film, he has introduced a brave new paintbrush, a canvas that would be unpopular with the amateur cinefile, but over time will be considered an independent classic.  Like he has done with such powerful films like ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", Aronofsky, with ""The Fountain"" has entered into the ranks of such budding directors as Richard Kelly and Christopher Nolan.  While his work may never be seen as mainstream, his thoughts are continuous, his sentences are bold and detailed, and his worlds are pure imagination.  This, ""The Fountain"", simply defines what a movie-going experience should be like.  He forces the audience to think, use the visual clues throughout to tell us the themes without making our antagonist speak them loudly for audiences to hear.  He designs outside the lines, and his film are considered too ""thinking"" for the average viewer, but to me, this was a movie, simply put, about love.  ""The Fountain"" is one of those broad scoping epic stories that felt eerily Kubrik-ian with its style, but purely Aronofsky with its imagery.  This is not a story for the weak of heart (or mind for that matter), but simply a story about a never aging love pushed through the heartstrings of immortality.To begin, Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story.  In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well ""Van Helsing"" himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic.  Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer.  His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering.  He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way.  Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand.  There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined.  Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together.  From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project.  This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced.  From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be ""cute"", but instead determined and sad at the same time.  We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh.  Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters.  This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's ""2001"" - perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that.  This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress.  From ""Pi"" I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of ""Requiem for a Dream"", he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo.  Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story.  This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe.  His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive.  He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment.  It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different - the same message was being sent.  His attention to detail was magnificent.  I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear.  This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life.  To me, that is what transformed ""The Fountain"" from your average sci-fi experience to something larger.  Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created.  This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty.  Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect.  The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story.  The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments.  Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly.  The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi.  Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden.  They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of ""The Fountain"".  While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.Overall, ""The Fountain"" was a fresh new film experience for me.  With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases.  As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable.  This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time - it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout.  This is not a film for all, but many should experience it.  The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet.  This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher.  It took you all over the map without pity or remorse.  ""The Fountain"" was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project.  Aronofsky continues to impress with his films.  They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year.  ""The Fountain"" should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended.  This is one of my favorites of the year.Grade: ***** out of *****",5,A homage to Kubrick - with a splash of Aronofsky's love of cinema,1213228800,"06 12, 2008",2008,6718,"['doubt', 'Darren',

If you like dark dramas which focus on death and dying, which try to convey a deep message in a very vague and mysterious way, and which jump around quickly between various scenes, you'll probably love it. If you like feel-good films and/or action/sci-fi, you probably won't. I do like some dramas (especially those that are based on true stories) but I prefer action/sci-fi, and the preview gave the impression this was one of those, maybe with a similar feel to ""The Illusionist."" But it's actually a dark, confusing drama that doesn't make much sense and is a jumble of philosophies thrown together like pick-up sticks. I watched it with 3 other people, and when it was done we all looked at each other with disgusted faces and said, in essence, ""WTH??""The movie's scenes continuously alternate between 3 scenarios. The 'present' scenario is of a scientist looking for a cure for brain cancer, and his wife who is dying of brain cancer. The 'past' scenario is a story written by the scientist's dying wife, which involves a Conquistador's bloody quest to find the Tree of Life in South America and deliver Spain and her Queen from the Inquisition. The 'future' scenario is of the scientist, who has kept himself alive for 1,000 years and is now bald, does yoga and tai chi, lives in a glass bubble floating towards a nebula in space, and eats the Tree of Life which is in the bubble with him. He also kisses and caresses the Tree of Life like a lover, which on the big screen is a very strange sight.Tying all these three narratives together seems to be the overarching message that death begins new life and is to be accepted and not feared or fought against.

647839,A1XKI53W1E891T,B00005JPAR,Amy,"[0, 2]","The Fountain is a passionate movie, and it moves with the inconstant waves of human feeling. For as much as it tickles the philosophical centers of the viewer's brain, if you try to intellectualize it too much, you'll lose it. You just have to let it happen and accept the irrational flow. The Fountain is about grief, about life and death, about sacrifice and the act of creation through reduction. Don't try to force the pieces together; the movie will assemble the puzzle for you. The plot has three separate, but intersecting timelines. The main line is in the present, where Dr. Creo is searching for a cure for cancer. He is driven and obsessed, determined to outrun the tumors that threaten to take his beloved wife away from him. For her part, Izzy indulges his dream. She yearns to spend more time with her husband, but she understands his compulsion. As a writer, she is trying to solve her own riddles about death. Her work in progress is a book called The Fountain, a period piece about a Spanish conquistador named Tomas searching for a Mayan temple believed to hold the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden, which is essentially the Fountain of Youth. Tomas was sent on the mission by Queen Isabela, who seeks eternal life for herself and her kingdom. We see the Spanish storyline played out as Tommy reads the manuscript, its narrative intertwining with his scientific mission. Izzy explains to him the various Mayan creation and afterlife myths she's uncovered in her research, and it inspires Tommy to seek different techniques. All the while, the third timeline, the future, runs its own course over the top of both of the other stories. This story is the most open to debate, possibly being another part of the book, but also possibly more connected to Tommy's consciousness.In this future, Jackman plays a caretaker for a tree that grows at the center of a star, its similarity to both the Tree of Life and the star that the Mayan's believe houses their souls after they die being immediately apparent. From how I see it, this symbolic plot line is a manifestation of Tommy's thoughts, of his inspiration and his guilt. The answers he seeks lie in somehow connecting this future story to the rest, steering the star to the Mayan temple and Izzy's hospital bed and not necessarily halting death, but at least finding some kind of understanding or acceptance.I will admit that The Fountain may not suit everyone's taste, but I still think that everyone should see it. Darren Aronofsky has written a script that is philosophical, spiritual, and emotional. With marvelous performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz, the director has made a movie that is emotionally powerful giving us a feast for our eyes while also stimulating our brains and our hearts.",5,The Fountain DVD,1203984000,"02 26, 2008",2008,2774,"['Fountain', 'passionate', 'movie', 'inconstant', 'waves', 'human', 'feeling', 'as', 'much', 'philosophical', 'centers', 'viewer', 'brain', 'try', 'intellectualize', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'lose', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'happen', 'accept', 'irrational', 'flow', 'Fountain', 'grief', 'life', 'death', 'sacrifice', 'act', 'creation', 'reduction', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'force', 'pieces', 'together', 'movie', 'will', 'assemble', 'puzzle', 'plot', 'three', 'separate', 'intersecting', 'timelines', 'main', 'line', 'present', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Creo', 'searching', 'cure', 'cancer', 'driven', 'obsessed', 'determined', 'outrun', 'tumors', 'threaten', 'take', 'beloved', 'wife', 'away', 'part', 'Izzy', 'dream', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'husband', 'compulsion', 'writer', 'trying', 'solve', 'own', 'riddles', 'death', 'work', 'progress', 'book', 'called', 'Fountain', 'period', 'piece', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'named', 'Tomas', 'searching', 'Mayan', 'temple', 'believed', 'hold', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Garden', 'Eden', 'essentially', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'Tomas', 'was', 'sent', 'mission', 'Queen', 'Isabela', 'who', 'eternal', 'life', 'herself', 'kingdom', 'see', 'Spanish', 'storyline', 'played', 'out', 'Tommy', 'manuscript', 'narrative', 'intertwining', 'scientific', 'mission', 'Izzy', 'various', 'Mayan', 'creation', 'afterlife', 'myths', 'uncovered', 'research', 'Tommy', 'seek', 'different', 'techniques', 'while', 'third', 'timeline', 'future', 'own', 'course', 'top', 'other', 'stories', 'story', 'most', 'open', 'debate', 'possibly', 'being', 'part', 'book', 'also', 'possibly', 'more', 'connected', 'Tommy', 'consciousness.In', 'future', 'Jackman', 'caretaker', 'tree', 'center', 'star', 'similarity', 'Tree', 'Life', 'star', 'Mayan', 'believe', 'houses', 'souls', 'die', 'being', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'how', 'see', 'symbolic', 'plot', 'line', 'manifestation', 'Tommy', 'thoughts', 'inspiration', 'guilt', 'answers', 'lie', 'somehow', 'connecting', 'future', 'story', 'rest', 'steering', 'star', 'Mayan', 'temple', 'Izzy', 'hospital', 'bed', 'not', 'necessarily', 'halting', 'death', 'least', 'finding', 'kind', 'understanding', 'acceptance.I', 'will', 'admit', 'Fountain', 'may', 'not', 'suit', 'everyone', 'taste', 'still', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'written', 'script', 'philosophical', 'spiritual', 'emotional', 'marvelous', 'performances', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'director', 'made', 'movie', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'giving', 'feast', 'eyes', 'also', 'stimulating', 'brains', 'hearts']",N/A
647840,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JPAR,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","A movie that grew on me while I slept `The Fountain' may actually be one of the best films of this past year.  It's smart, entertaining, thought provoking and elegantly paced with enough frustration, grief and sympathy to grab hold of the audience and their emotions and exploit them to the full.  If you are willing to give yourself over to `The Fountain' then you will find one of the more fulfilling movie going experiences in years, but your enjoyment will hinge fully on your willing participation.  If you easily off put by the strange side of science fiction and don't like movies that refuse to answer themselves then this may not be the movie for you, but if you readily become absorbed in cinema and relish in films that leave themselves ambiguous and up to personal interpretation, demanding the viewer think and rethink the plot hours after the credits have rolled searching for some kind of solace then this is definitely a film for you.At heart `The Fountain' is a story about love and the lengths one will go to maintain and preserve that deep rooted feeling of love.  While `The Fountain' may consist of three interlocking stories the main solitary focus is that of prolonged love.  Tomas, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman, is a neurosurgeon whose wife Izzi, played effortlessly by Rachel Weisz, is dying of a tumorous disease.  Izzi is free spirited and strong in her position and tries her hardest to shield her husband from her worsening condition to spare him any added grief, but Tomas still struggles to find a cure for her condition even if it means pushing all other away from him.  This is the foundation for `The Fountain' and while our two main characters alternate between present time, 16th Century Spain and years into the future it all keeps coming back to the present life changing events that prove a catalyst for everything before and after.The film is deep and moving and its mood and atmosphere are added to by the impressive cast.  Jackman gives the performance of his career here, delving into three sets of emotions and unlocking three characters with enough subtlety that it appears like a natural progression.  Weisz may have won the Oscar for her previous years work but here is where she proved to me she was worth that little golden man.  Her performance is so natural and effortlessly breezy that you can't help but be drawn into those deep pools she calls eyes.  The bathtub scene is especially effective for both these actors' cases and brought tears to both my wife and I.  The supporting cast is strong despite their lack of screen time, the legendary Ellen Burstyn standing out among the crowd, but its director Darren Aronofsky who truly commands and conquers here.I've been a fan of Aronofsky since his brilliant work in `Requiem for a Dream' and was equally impressed by his vision in `The Fountain'.  He's a uniquely driven director who truly puts his heart and soul into his work, giving it a special touch of devotion that helps settle the experience upon the audience.  He's invested in his work and you can tell he believes in it.  Aronofsky directs his cast with such dedication and fervor and it shows and it pays off delivering a one of a kind experience.

647845,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00005JPAR,Anthony L.,"[4, 4]","The Fountain is a transcendental experience. There is only one word to truly describe it: beautiful. It is an absolutely mind-blowing, stunningly beautiful, extremely ambitious, brilliantly acted piece of visual poetry, with a haunting score by Clint Mansell, and one of the most beautiful endings I have ever witnessed in a movie.But on top of that, you have to feel sorry for directorDarren Aronofsky. He envisioned a film with a $75,000,000 budget starring superstars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. After much compromising and bartering on Aronofsky's side, Warner Bros agreed to gamble and finance a $35 million dollar film starringHugh JackmanandRachel Weisz. The Fountain received mixed reviews from critics, and, while it has in later years become something of a cult classic, it did not connect at the box office as well as it should. The Fountain has steadily stayed at a...comfortable...level of obscurity.But I really feel, and I believe I am not alone in my opinions, that The Fountain is a mightily underrated movie and it should be more well known. It is a stunning work of cinema, epic in scope, and ambitious in plot, mind-blowingly complex and beautifully touching in it's human characters.The Fountain tells three stories: each intertwining and moving over eachother, overlapping and affecting the others with the ripples of their character's actions. And the film is driven by the characters. The Fountain, unlike many other special effects-filled science fiction films, has a heartbreakingly human story at it's centre. The story of Thomas/Tommy/Tom's (played to perfection by Hugh Jackman - the line ""Death is a disease - a disease like any other. And there is a cure...a cure - and I will find it!"" is one of my favourites and has stayed with me) neverending quest to beat death and save his beloved; Isabella/Izzy (played beautifully by Oscar winner Rachel Weisz).Needless to say, this leads to obsession, and obsession leads to guilt and worse, but before the end, viewers will be asking, ""Will Thomas find Cibalba? Will he save his love?"" Aronofsky does not disappoint, and he keeps the film on slow-burn tension for the most part until it climaxes in the one of the most stunning, beautiful, haunting, and poignant scenes ever filmed.Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you, but let me just say it involves electrifying acting on the part of Jackman, amazing cinematography, and Clint Mansell's absolutely brilliant score. Did I mention the score? This is a score that will stay with you for the rest of your life; haunting, ethereal, and every other superlative that spells brilliant!The three timelines are not given equal screen time, and all are not entirely seamless. The Fountain can feel like it is being willfully confusing and difficult, and at times feels deliberately slow-moving. Character's motivations occasionally seem strange, and the ending may put casual viewers off the film. This is a movie that must be pondered, mulled over, and given much, ahem, ""intellectual"" thought. This is NOT a film for everyone. However, for the patient, smarter viewer, The Fountain is pure visual poetry.Woven richly with themes biblical, scientific, and mythological; spanning from the close jungles of Peru, to the present day United States, to an age far in the future, we follow a lone conquistador serving his queen, a man determined to cheat death for his wife, and an explorer, alone with a tree in a ""life-bubble"", searching for the mystical city of gold: Cibalba. This is The Fountain. Heartbreaking in it's human tragedy and drama, stunning beautiful in it's visual style and cinematography, challenging and thought-provoking in it's message, and lingering and haunting in the mind forever after.This is The Fountain.

647849,AZ5T9WY670KYD,B00005JPAR,Audra Alexander,"[3, 5]","In stark contrast to the realistic hopefulness ofChildren of Men (Widescreen Edition)comes The Fountain, a Darren Aronofsky film about the transcendence of death. I saw Aronofsky's other works, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, so I knew what I was in for in The Fountain; deliberately challenging visuals, elite performances and stylized storytelling. And again, as a fan of science fiction, I thought Aronofsky's unique vision would bring the duality of science and spirituality together successfully. This movie has a lot going for it, but I wouldn't call it a ""success"".The Fountain was billed as a love story that crosses a thousand years, and technically, I suppose that's true. We open on a Spanish Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) in love with his queen (Rachel Weisz) who is threatened by the Spanish Inquisition. Move to present day drug developer, Tommy (Jackman), in love with his wife, Lizzie (Weisz), threatened by an inoperable brain tumor. Move to futuristic ""space traveler"" (Jackman) in love with a tree (Weisz) threatened by the movie's exhausting length and painful stretch of our suspension of disbelief.  Though do not let me suggest that the film moved even half as coherently as the above synopsis.The Fountain has appealing visual elements which are all the more amazing when you understand that it was not in the finance-league of huge CGI productions. From a purely cinematography standpoint, it's quite amazing. The stars, also, have that silver-screen chemistry that is part luck and part talented professionals doing a fine job. Not to be missed is Ellen Burstyn's grounded performance as Jackman's boss in the present-day storyline. Speaking of storyline, what could be more ambitious or romantic than following love through death? It has all the elements of a fantastic sci-fi romance, but none of the subtlety.The visual elements may be a talented technical feat, but the metaphorical use of those visuals to promote the story are somewhat less so, at some points becoming embarrassing parodies of 1960's cinema, only without the considered and sparing use in those films. The disjointed method of bouncing back and forth between timelines was made ineffective by continuously flashing the revelatory scenes from beginning to end, robbing them of their impact. At one point, Hugh Jackman's glowing, bald, lotus-position form becomes so cringe-inducing you half expect David Carradine to jump up and protest. The opening ""historical"" story line is rife with inaccuracies which aren't explained until much later to be a fictional construct of the characters. Hugh Jackman's emoting is filmed with a heavy-handedness that makes him somewhat less sympathetic rather than more.I love the idea of showing three stories, or viewpoints, congruently. It allows the storyteller to clearly illustrate the common thematic element, in this case the ""Tree of Life"", both as a mythical and spiritual symbol. This idea works marvelously for the historical and present-day storylines as an example of the transformative powers of death; i.e. energy is never lost, only transformed, but by the end of the picture, I felt as though I'd been bludgeoned with the idea by one of it's thicker branches.

647850,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B00005JPAR,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[1, 2]","""The Fountain""(Warner Brothers, 2006)---------------------------------------Hugh Jackman stars in this trippy, oooh-pretty! modern parable about mankind's struggle between impending death and eternal life.  He plays Dr. Thomas Creo, a high-level scientific researcher racing against time to find a cure for his wife's cancer. He is anchored to the real world by a medical bureaucracy that insists on verifiable results and replicable experiments, while what he wants is a magical breakthrough. Meanwhile, while pursuing love, he loses sight of humanity, and the magic he seeks unfolds in parallel plotlines and luminous, cosmic sequences in which his spiritual form ascends into the stars, learning how acceptance and sacrifice lead to what we mortal beings can consider immortality.  The groovy, hippie-ish mystic/meditation scenes won't resonate with all audiences, but for many viewers this story will recall the cosmic yearnings of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001,"" as well as the disconnected hallucinations of ""Jacob's Ladder.""  The plot here is not as oblique or hard to follow, but the sentiment is similar: what's not clear, however, is how much director Darren Aronofsky is urging the human race to evolve, or how much he is saying that this very quest -- to be more than we really are -- is quixotic and doomed to fail, much like the conquistador's search for a fountain of youth.  Visionary or fatalistic? Perhaps a mixture of both?  Viewers will have to decide for themselves.

What's with all the extreme closeups of Hugh Jackman's mouth, the walls of an elevator, and the side of Rachel Weiz's head?  And all the upside down motion shots also got on my nerves.Second, the story seems very hollow.  It's an interesting premise, but the love stories throughout the various time periods,(or inside of Jackman's head, I couldn't really tell) seem very banal and uninteresting.  Maybe it was the actors involved, but I just didn't get in to the alleged emotion of the whole thing.This story is also devoid of any humor whatsoever.  If you make a movie like this, with heavy themes about love and death, perhaps a break in the monotony might have been useful.  The closest thing to comic relief is the monkey Donovan, which is funny if your in to that kind of thing.The best part of the movie is the visuals.  The visuals with the space travel are very creative and well imagined as well as the visuals of 16th century Spain.But being pretty does not make a good movie.

647857,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00005JPAR,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[0, 1]","My first sense that this film was misconceived when I realized that although the title cited the famed ""Fountain of Youth"", the destination of the quest in all three segments of the film was a tree and not a fountain. That's all well and good, since there is far more mythic baggage attached to trees than to fountains, but still, the title leads down a dark ally, into a cul-de-sac, were we never find that fountain.I think the sense that this film is highly original is misplaced. The three part story, with past, present, and future, all tied up in a quest, is as old as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"", which was so entrancing that I went to see it three times on the first weekend it opened in theaters. What we saw was clearly an important film, lovingly crafted, with a level of realism unknown in space operas before or since (although I hear the film ""Gravity"" may have matched it.) The theme was hidden, but it was evident that it was important to figure out what that theme was. The transition between eras, past, present, and future, was seamless and done with stunning clarity, with no ""interleaving"" of events from the three.The theme of ""The Fountain"" comes to us very slowly, and with obscure connections between the clues. An example of another film which botched flashbacks is ""Catch-22"" and the story of the airman dying on the damaged B-25. It never quite works. It seems as if there are so many loose ends. Unlike 2001, where the connection between the present and future main character (pilot, David Bowman)is crystal clear, in ""The Fountain"", the connection is less like a distinct chronology and transition from man to star-child, than simply a parallel story line with some similarities between characters played by Jackman and Weisz in the present and future.Something in me screams that ""I should like this film!"" But, alas, it seems like a valiant effort which lost its way. I will add that for that reason, the supplementary special feature on the DVD, on the making of the film, is essential. I simply would not have gotten the point of some aspects of the film without that documentary. (Among other things, it shows that Hugh Jackman did indeed have his head shaved for some scenes.

647858,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B00005JPAR,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[4, 5]","Okay all of you sci-fi geeks out there. It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see ""yet another"" science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petrie dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi?The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together.

647862,A2AA00U9FO4UAC,B00005JPAR,Bradley J. Keusch,"[11, 14]","Aronofsky's thoughts on the nature of life and death certainly do not disappoint. I'm shocked, however, that the studio chose to release this film on thanksgiving weekend to little fanfare, where it will almost certainly get slaughtered. At any rate, the film is great and flirts with being tremendous. Matthew Libatique's cinematography never fails to be anything less than breathtaking, and it certainly is here. There are striking, majestic images, and the film truly does look amazing. The film uses silence to great effect, but when Clint Mansell's score does show up, it is fitting and powerful as well. Jackman's performance I thought was strong, and is certainly light years away from his turn as Wolverine in X-men. After seeing the film I can't really imagine Brad Pitt playing this part, as he was originally intended to. That being said, this certainly isn't a movie for everyone, and is probably less accessible than either Pi or Requiem. For those who might not quite ""get it"", the following is my interpretation of the film, with **SPOILERS**.The film's theme, at it's very heart, is that holding desperately onto life can lead only to death, while accepting death as a form of life and creation, can make life come alive. There are three story lines, the only one that may really be ""real"" is the one in the present, but it doesn't matter much as they all end up saying the same thing. In the present, Jackman's wife Izzy has brain cancer and is on her way out, and he is a doctor studying cancer treatments, desperately trying to find one that will save her. All through their interaction in the present, he is obsessed with holding onto her, with finding a way to make her live. He ignores things that she says in conversation, focusing only on the things that he think may allow her to live. He is absolutely terrified about her impending doom. At one point while he is in a hospital room with her, he even exclaims ""I just want to be with you!"" and her reply to this is ""You ARE with me, right now!"" But his obsession with finding some way to prolong her life blinds him to most everything else (one notable scene illustrating this is when he walks down the road to a completely silent audio track, even as ambulances drive by with sirens flashing), even to his remaining time with her. What leads to his eventual liberation is what Izzy found so fascinating, and even wrote her story on, the Mayan mythology. Their creation story contains the ""first man"" who sacrificed himself in order to create the world. It is a common theme throughout all mythology across all cultures, life out of death. There cannot be life without death. We come from the earth, our bodies are built out of it, and when we die we return to it so that new forms can be created. Stars are formed from accumulations of gases and dust, and when they explode with unbelievable grandeur, they spew these components out into the void, where they will form new stars. Izzy was able to find peace in this notion, that her life and death were part of the great mystery of life, and she was able to identify with this great cosmic energy that pervades everything. Jackman's character cannot accept this, and he decries death as a disease, which he will work to cure. But in the end, this is fruitless. Man cannot live forever, and what's more, even if it WERE possible, it would serve only to rob life of its meaning. He realizes this, as in the final chapter of Izzy's book, he has the conquistador taste the sap of the tree, and he then immediately returns to the earth. In this sense he can ""live forever"", but not in the way that he had hoped as his consciousness perishes. In the future (which to me seemed like a generalization of the present storyline, i.e. the tree of life dying wasn't JUST Izzy dying, but represented life in general) the Jackman character laughs when, after the tree has died, he realizes that he too will finally perish. As the star explodes, we see him rise upwards, identifying with the fact that he will die, and thus transcending it, even AS he dies. And the tree of life blooms as he disentegrates into it, life out of death once again.I would like to quote one of my friends who I think summed the concept up brilliantly: ""these things point the way to reveling in and revering the passions we experience in life. In the spirit of these revels, we are engaged, connected, conscious, and wholly (and holy-ly) participating in the moment rather than scheming on how we can prolong, guard, or perpetually keep the moment, all for ourselves (eternal exclusivity being the province of ego), never allowing change to transmute these pinnacles of human-ness we are fortunate enough to find ourselves experiencing. In the words of another wise teacher, ""Love is the middle way between attachment and detachment."" If we are living from, in, and with love, where will we find the need to hold on, to form an attachment, when we are surrounded, enveloped, and fully part of an energy that is exponentially more powerful?"" and thus, why should we be afraid of death. This is why Jackman goes back, and chooses to spend time with his wife, choosing to life his life NOW. This is, in the end, all that we can do, and by recognizing that we WILL die, and identifying with that, EVERY moment that we DO have, necessarily becomes so important, becomes truly alive.Definitely check this film out, and if you enjoy it, spread the word.

Christopher Blackshere ""Mackshere""","[3, 4]","I read the graphic novel extracted from the brilliant mind of Darren Aronofsky, who previously directed Pi, Requiem for a Dream.  He mentioned how The Fountain almost never made it to the big screen because it was a big budget project that lacked mass public appeal.  I know I was flabbergasted when this artistic masterpiece was pulled from my local theater after one week.  Alas, I had to wait for the DVD, but was glad it didn't disappoint.This is a romantic sci-fi journey that explores the existential constraints of the human spirit.  The story orbits around the present day, stretching ostensibly into the past and the future.  It floats around through time and space, spreading throughout the millenium that engulfs us.It involves three seperate stories from three different eras.  Each adventure is connected by the same character, Hugh Jackman, in which his bodily form apparently is reincarnated.In each tale the protagonist is obssessd with the pursuit of immortality.  Each quest is geared toward the ""Tree of Life"" from the Garden of Eden.  Jackman plays a 16th century conquistador, a present day cancer researcher, and a 26th century astronaut.This movie is imbued with all sorts of dazzling, imaginative special effects that give it quite a surreal feel.  It's both intellectual and emotional.  It raises a glaring question about our humanity, which seems to be defined both by our life and especially our death.  If death is taken out of the equation, would we lose our humanity?Parts of this movie can be confusing and hard to follow.  But I have an interpretation that makes sense to me, although it might not be what is intended.  I view the entire movie as if it takes place in the present day, and the leaps backward and foward in time are merely the imaginary story that the ailing wife(Rachel Weisz)is writing as she is dying from cancer.

647888,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00005JPAR,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 14]","Either ""The Fountain"" is one of the most nonsensical films ever made, or I'm simply too dense a person to have understood it. I honestly don't know how to feel about it anymore; I saw this film with my mother, and when we left the theater, I saw she had tears in her eyes. ""This is a beautiful film,"" she said quietly, wiping at her cheeks with a shriveled tissue. I was completely at a loss for words. How is this film beautiful, other than because of some moments of impressive digital effects? To say this story is cryptic would be a colossal understatement, and I just can't understand why it had to be so alternative that it alienated any sense of reason. This has to be the most aimless movie I've ever seen, going passive-aggressively from scene to scene with virtually nothing holding its individual moments together, save for a couple of weak narrative links.Now, you may be asking yourself, ""What is this film about?"" Well, that's the catch: I have absolutely no idea what this film is about, and I can't even begin to describe a cohesive plotline. The best I can offer are vague snippets of information, ones that make sense in and of themselves but have no structure when put together in the same movie. The most prominently featured motif is the idea of birth, death, and rebirth, physically represented at times by a mythical tree of life, at others by Rachel Weisz as both Queen Isabella of Spain and a modern-day cancer patient. What any one image has to do with the other is anyone's guess; there are three individual narratives in the film, each separated by several hundred years, each randomly weaving in and out of each other. They had little if any connection, other than the notion that one could live forever if he or she looks in the right place.One narrative takes place in the 1500s during the Spanish Inquisition. Hugh Jackman enters the film during this segment as a devoted conquistador willing to sacrifice himself for the salvation of Spain; apparently, a power-hungry inquisitor (Stephen McHattie) is slowly taking the country over, and he's about ready to attack the queen in a final display of torture. But according to the unrealistically calm queen, there is hope for their beloved country. As stated in Mayan legend, a miraculous tree resides deep within the jungles of New Spain (modern day Central America). Anyone who drinks of its sap will live forever. With such reliable information, the conquistador is sent to this land with a monk in order to find the tree. Exactly how going about this task would in any way, shape, or form help an oppressed country is beyond me. It would have been nice if some kind of an explanation were given, even if it was an unrealistic one.Another segment takes place in the present day. Jackman now plays Tommy, a doctor obsessed with finding a cure for cancer. His current patient is an ape named Donovan, who unfortunately has a brain tumor. When Tommy sees that Donovan is slipping further and further away from life, he decides to take drastic measures. With a quick rummage through an assortment of files, he finds what he's looking for: an organic material taken from a special tree found in Central America. Maybe an injection of this stuff will help the poor little simian recover. And sure enough, it does; his vital signs improve beyond anyone's expectations, and his head scar heals much more quickly than normal. Unfortunately, the tumor itself remains unscathed. This is incredibly distressing for Tommy; the whole point of doing this medical research is to help his wife, Izzi (Weisz), who's brain cancer is progressing to the point of diminishing her tactile sensitivity.This segment description may make it seem as if it's the most structured one of the film, but the reality is that it's just as out of place as the previous one. Consider the loss of Tommy's wedding ring; we see this object continually reappear throughout the film, originating as a charm on Queen Isabella's necklace. It must have been some kind of symbol, possibly the classic symbol of unity and commitment. But then why did it have to be lost in the first place? It only added another layer of drama to a story that was already overflowing. And then there's Izzi's book, which documents the life and death beliefs of the ancient Mayans. All but the last chapter is finished, and it's her wish that Tommy finish the book. He continually says that he can't, that he doesn't know the end, and that he doesn't know how to reach the end. Finally, one of the characters expresses what I've been feeling throughout the entire movie.The third segment is probably the most baffling one. It presumably takes place in the distant future, a time when people float through space in giant bubbles. This is the way we find a now bald and barefoot Hugh Jackman, trapped inside his own snow globe with a hair-covered tree. The unabashed strangeness of this segment can only be indicative of a spiritual mind excursion, so much so that any form of explanation would be pointless. Apparently, this bubble is heading for a nebula, one that surrounds a dying star. This dying star, according to Mayan legend, is the place where the life/death exchange takes place. Interestingly enough, Izzi had already identified this nebula during the present day segment by viewing it through her telescope. It also served as the basis for her book.As this futuristic Tommy floats through space, he hears voices, has fleeting hallucinations of both Izzi and Queen Isabella, and periodically cuts off a piece of the tree's hairy bark to chew on. He even tattoos himself with a fountain pen (which started in the present day segment after Tommy lost the ring). Like many other aspects of this movie, I can't explain the significance of any of it. That's probably why I disliked this movie; it's a visually stunning work, but the story is so convoluted and so mysterious that it prevents the viewer from understanding anything about it. I don't mind when a film relies heavily on visual material, but it should at least be part of a story that's actually about something.But even as I say this, I think back to my mother, who found the story so touching and meaningful that she was reduced to tears. I don't deny the possibility that I completely missed the point of this film, that I'm too mainstream a viewer to be entertained by this kind of narrative.

It is a little chamber piece that happens to be a nice movie.  This nonlinear fable reminds me mostly of a Robin Williams movie, Being Human and somewhat another by the same actor titled What Dreams May Come. 2001: A Space Odyssey also comes to mind, too.  It is a love story that goes cosmic, breaking through the fabric of the physical world and astral science exploring a spiritual plain.  I was expecting something more conventional in love stories and science fiction.  The opening of the movie pretty much dashed that to the rocks but in a good way demanding my mind to loosen up and go for a ride. Mayan astronomy and a fiction being written are the vehicles for bending reality. The language is not just speech but shapes, pictures, light.Hugh Jackman has to perform more emotion in this movie than the other characters and other parts he has played. He succeeds at showing a lot of range and selling this notion to us.  Rachel Weisz plays an idea wonderfully, female characters that aren't women like the rest of us. (She mostly just has to look good and fit into the story, which can be tricky because she projects a lot of presence.)  The acting is intelligent and interesting.As for production, it is admirable. In the documentary footage of how the movie was born, Darren Aronofsky and his colleagues were on a journey that burst into something different than they had originally conceived. It is hard to decribe this film accurately.  I hope these notes are helpful. It does and will provoke more and more thought for thoughtful people.",3,Xibalba is the best way to explain this movie,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,1646,"['Beware', 'linear', 'explanation', 'Fountain', 'difficult', 'definitely', 'tell', 'plot', 'little', 'chamber', 'piece', 'be', 'nice', 'movie', 'nonlinear', 'fable', 'reminds', 'mostly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'movie', 'Being', 'Human', 'somewhat', 'same', 'actor', 'titled', 'What', 'Dreams', 'May', 'Come', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'also', 'mind', 'too', 'love', 'story', 'cosmic', 'breaking', 'fabric', 'physical', 'world', 'astral', 'science', 'exploring', 'spiritual', 'plain', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'conventional', 'love', 'stories', 'science', 'fiction', 'opening', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'dashed', 'rocks', 'good', 'way', 'demanding', 'mind', 'loosen', 'up', 'go', 'ride', 'Mayan', 'astronomy', 'fiction', 'being', 'written', 'are', 'vehicles', 'bending', 'reality', 'language', 'not', 'just', 'speech', 'shapes', 'pictures', 'light.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'perform', 'more', 'emotion', 'movie', 'other', 'characters', 'other', 'parts', 'played', 'showing', 'lot', 'range', 'selling', 'notion', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'idea', 'wonderfully', 'female', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'women', 'rest', 'mostly', 'just', 'look', 'good', 'fit', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'tricky', 'projects', 'lot', 'presence', 'acting', 'intelligent', 'interesting.As', 'production', 'admirable', 'documentary', 'footage', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'born', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'colleagues', 'were', 'journey', 'something', 'different', 'had', 'originally', 'conceived', 'hard', 'decribe', 'film', 'accurately', 'hope', 'notes', 'are', 'helpful', 'will', 'provoke', 'more', 'more', 'thought', 'thoughtful', 'people']",N/A

647892,A3H4UBJFQEI72Q,B00005JPAR,"Cirilio Villaverde ""chango48""","[11, 13]","I think the movie demonstrates, by its lack of audiences and mass appeal, what is wrong with our US movie-going public: we're being dumbed-down.  If a movie doesn't establish the plot line in the first three minutes, if it doesn't follow a linear story line, and if you the viewer actually have to think about what is going on (god forbid!) vice sitting numbly in your seat while your senses are overwhelmed with noise and a consequent cacophony of images, then forget it, too much work, why bother going to see it.Well I'll tell you: Darren Aronofsky may not be ""brilliant,"" but he sure does think differently and thus makes us thinkg.  This is his third movie, and the biggest budget-film of the three.  I only saw one other of his movies, ""Pi,"" and I was very impressed.  It was a low-budget independent film.  But this latest, The Fountain, is actually three stories in one, each with the same issue at their core: the search for a continuation of life.  I won't say ""eternal"" life necessarily, although that is certainly the goal in one of the story lines.  The idea of immortality, of fighting against death, of living longer, is certainly not a new topic... far from it.  But through three separate yet ingeniously interweaving story lines Aronofsky deals with the issue beautifully, poetically, and originally: a Spanish conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth (aka Tree of Life); a modern-day researcher examining the effects of a newly discovered plant on cancerous tumors (with the goal of racing against time as his wife falls ill with her own cancerous growth); and a futuristic traveler seeking to restore his loved one--a tree--to full life.  I was left wondering if this 26th-century tree is the same 20th-century pod which he planted... The movie is rich with symbolism, imagery, and references.  Truly wonderful, truly a work of art.I liked it so much I had to see it again, and was utterly disappointed when the theaters weren't carrying it anymore--again, no mass appeal, no quick commercial sales, so out of the theaters it goes.  I'm only glad it came out again, in the lower-budget theaters.  I plan on seeing it at least one more time; the effects employed and the music are beyond amazing and I feel a need to experience the magic of Aronofsky's skill on the big screen once more.",4,Beyond Beautiful,1168905600,"01 16, 2007",2007,2314,"['think', 'movie', 'lack', 'audiences', 'mass', 'appeal', 'what', 'wrong', 'US', 'movie-going', 'public', ""'re"", 'being', 'dumbed-down', 'movie', ""n't"", 'establish', 'plot', 'line', 'first', 'three', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'follow', 'linear', 'story', 'line', 'viewer', 'actually', 'have', 'think', 'what', 'going', 'god', 'forbid', 'vice', 'sitting', 'numbly', 'seat', 'senses', 'are', 'overwhelmed', 'noise', 'consequent', 'cacophony', 'images', 'then', 'forget', 'too', 'much', 'work', 'why', 'bother', 'going', 'see', 'it.Well', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'brilliant', 'sure', 'think', 'differently', 'thus', 'thinkg', 'third', 'movie', 'biggest', 'budget-film', 'three', 'only', 'saw', 'one', 'other', 'movies', 'Pi', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'was', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'latest', 'Fountain', 'actually', 'three', 'stories', 'one', 'same', 'issue', 'core', 'search', 'continuation', 'life', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'eternal', 'life', 'necessarily', 'certainly', 'goal', 'one', 'story', 'lines', 'idea', 'immortality', 'fighting', 'death', 'living', 'longer', 'certainly', 'not', 'new', 'topic', 'far', 'three', 'separate', 'yet', 'ingeniously', 'interweaving', 'story', 'lines', 'Aronofsky', 'deals', 'issue', 'beautifully', 'poetically', 'originally', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'searching', 'Fountain', 'Youth', 'aka', 'Tree', 'Life', 'modern-day', 'researcher', 'examining', 'effects', 'newly', 'discovered', 'plant', 'cancerous', 'tumors', 'goal', 'racing', 'time', 'wife', 'ill', 'own', 'cancerous', 'growth', 'futuristic', 'traveler', 'seeking', 'restore', 'loved', 'one', 'tree', 'full', 'life', 'was', 'left', 'wondering', '26th-century', 'tree', 'same', '20th-century', 'pod', 'planted', 'movie', 'rich', 'symbolism', 'imagery', 'references', 'Truly', 'wonderful', 'truly', 'work', 'art.I', 'liked', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'was', 'utterly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'theaters', 'were', ""n't"", 'carrying', 'anymore', 'again', 'mass', 'appeal', 'quick', 'commercial', 'sales', 'so', 'theaters', ""'m"", 'only', 'glad', 'came', 'out', 'again', 'lower-budget', 'theaters', 'plan', 'seeing', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'effects', 'employed', 'music', 'are', 'amazing', 'feel', 'need', 'experience', 'magic', 'Aronofsky', 'skill', 'big', 'screen', 'once', 'more']",N/A

647894,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00005JPAR,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 3]","Earlier this year, I had the opportunity (or misfortune) to watch Shortbus, a sexually frank film that was meant to be a huge study and deconstruction of people's perceptions of sex but really, it was just a message film with a bad story attached to it. The Fountain was most likely made to be an art film; a film that was meant to be studied and dissected and debated about a la 2001: A Space Odyssey or the Matrix. While these films are meant to be admired for the amount of attention and passion put into it, that doesn't automatically make it a film that deserves heaps of praise or at least from everyone.In the first of 3 of interconnected storylines, Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical doctor and researcher looking to cure brain tumors. This is an extremely personal case since his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) suffers from a brain tumor. Izzy is writing a book entitled the Fountain, a period piece about the Conquistador Tomas who is sent on a mission by the Queen of Spain to find the Tree of Life in the Mayan civilization so she can use it to restore glory to Spain since an evil Inquisitor has been causing trouble. In the third storyline taking place about 400 years in the future, a bald Jackman is travelling through space in a bubble which houses a tree as he travels to a dying star, said to be the gateway to the Mayan underworld. Shifting back and forth, we see the passion and determination of how far one goes for love.Now I have to give props where it's due: this is one lush and gorgeous film. Probably the bulk of that praise goes to the future segment done largely by macrophotography. Even though the idea of a bubble spaceship will elicit laughter, it just looks fantastic and was probably quite a sight on the big screen (our stupid theatre never showed it here). The rest of the film is as good from Spain and Old Spain with the present day segment looking the most ""normal"". The problem is, like how I felt about 2001, is that the film seems too...cold, kind of clinical as if the character's emotional journey is an important one but the way it's presented as a detached quality. Some will definately disagree and say it is but that's the basis of the film: everyone will walk away with different ideas of what they just saw which becomes a slight problem.The problem is that this film wants to be important and studied that it almost has a calculated approach, like they know they're making an important film and this is something for people who truly get it. This is meant to create discussion. ""Is there a Tree of Life? Does love last forever? Is the Spanish segment Tommy and Izzy's past life? Did Tommy find the Tree of Life and is travelling through space? All in his head? Can 2 and 2 really equal five? Dude."" I thought Requiem of a Dream was a technically better film than it was emotionally. The Fountain isn't as bad as that but some might walk away feeling like they saw a technically outstanding film but a little bit too pretentious for its own good.Even if you might have conflicting views about its story, you got to admit the acting is pretty spot-on. While best known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men films, Jackman is practically on fire here playing his character with such emotion and drive that it reaffirms this guy is one to watch. And while probably the more subtle, Weisz is excellent as Izzy and Isobel (the Spanish Queen) and you really believe someone would hunt to the ends of Earth and Space to be with her again. The rest of the cast, namely Ellen Burstyn, are good but you don't really know much about them and probably will forget their names. But ultimately this is Jackman and Weisz's movie and they deliver in spades.Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with a negative or positive review, this is a film everyone should at least see once.",3,One of the most polarizing films in recent years,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,3813,"['Earlier', 'year', 'had', 'opportunity', 'misfortune', 'watch', 'Shortbus', 'sexually', 'frank', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'huge', 'study', 'deconstruction', 'people', 'perceptions', 'sex', 'really', 'was', 'just', 'message', 'film', 'bad', 'story', 'attached', 'Fountain', 'was', 'most', 'likely', 'made', 'be', 'art', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'studied', 'dissected', 'debated', 'la', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'Matrix', 'films', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'admired', 'amount', 'attention', 'passion', 'put', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'make', 'film', 'heaps', 'praise', 'least', 'everyone.In', 'first', '3', 'interconnected', 'storylines', 'Tommy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'medical', 'doctor', 'researcher', 'looking', 'cure', 'brain', 'tumors', 'extremely', 'personal', 'case', 'wife', 'Izzy', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'suffers', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Izzy', 'writing', 'book', 'entitled', 'Fountain', 'period', 'piece', 'Conquistador', 'Tomas', 'who', 'sent', 'mission', 'Queen', 'Spain', 'find', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Mayan', 'civilization', 'can', 'use', 'restore', 'glory', 'Spain', 'evil', 'Inquisitor', 'been', 'causing', 'trouble', 'third', 'storyline', 'taking', 'place', '400', 'years', 'future', 'bald', 'Jackman', 'travelling', 'space', 'bubble', 'houses', 'tree', 'dying', 'star', 'said', 'be', 'gateway', 'Mayan', 'underworld', 'Shifting', 'back', 'forth', 'see', 'passion', 'determination', 'how', 'far', 'one', 'love.Now', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'where', 'due', 'one', 'lush', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'Probably', 'bulk', 'praise', 'future', 'segment', 'done', 'largely', 'macrophotography', 'Even', 'idea', 'bubble', 'spaceship', 'will', 'elicit', 'laughter', 'just', 'fantastic', 'was', 'probably', 'quite', 'sight', 'big', 'screen', 'stupid', 'theatre', 'never', 'showed', 'here', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'good', 'Spain', 'Old', 'Spain', 'present', 'day', 'segment', 'looking', 'most', 'normal', 'problem', 'how', 'felt', '2001', 'film', 'too', 'cold', 'kind', 'clinical', 'character', 'emotional', 'journey', 'important', 'one', 'way', 'presented', 'detached', 'quality', 'will', 'definately', 'disagree', 'say', 'basis', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'walk', 'away', 'different', 'ideas', 'what', 'just', 'saw', 'slight', 'problem.The', 'problem', 'film', 'be', 'important', 'studied', 'almost', 'calculated', 'approach', 'know', ""'re"", 'making', 'important', 'film', 'something', 'people', 'who', 'truly', 'get', 'meant', 'create', 'discussion', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Does', 'love', 'last', 'forever', 'Spanish', 'segment', 'Tommy', 'Izzy', 'past', 'life', 'Did', 'Tommy', 'find', 'Tree', 'Life', 'travelling', 'space', 'head', 'Can', '2', '2', 'really', 'equal', 'five', 'Dude', 'thought', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'was', 'technically', 'better', 'film', 'was', 'emotionally', 'Fountain', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'might', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'saw', 'technically', 'outstanding', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'pretentious', 'own', 'good.Even', 'might', 'have', 'conflicting', 'views', 'story', 'got', 'admit', 'acting', 'pretty', 'spot-on', 'best', 'known', 'playing', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'films', 'Jackman', 'practically', 'fire', 'here', 'playing', 'character', 'such', 'emotion', 'drive', 'guy', 'one', 'watch', 'probably', 'more', 'subtle', 'Weisz', 'excellent', 'Izzy', 'Isobel', 'Spanish', 'Queen', 'really', 'believe', 'someone', 'would', 'hunt', 'ends', 'Earth', 'Space', 'be', 'again', 'rest', 'cast', 'namely', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'are', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'probably', 'will', 'forget', 'names', 'ultimately', 'Jackman', 'Weisz', 'movie', 'deliver', 'spades.Regardless', 'agree', 'disagree', 'negative', 'positive', 'review', 'film', 'everyone', 'should', 'least', 'see', 'once']",N/A

647899,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,B00005JPAR,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[1, 1]","Director Darren Aronofsky (Pi and Requiem for a Dream) has created a niche for himself in the film industry. Much like filmmakers David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Vincent Ward, Darren Aronofsky explores the realm of dark drama, where dreams and fantasies flow into everyday reality. His film The Fountain is an ambitious science fiction/fantasy film with a strong metaphysical undercurrent. As always, Aronofsky utilizes his keen visual sense of storytelling while focusing on characterization and maintaining an emotional momentum. What really brings the film together is the unique narrative structure that combines three different timeframes. This storytelling device can partly be accredited to Aronofsky, though most of the praise should go to the film's under appreciated editor, Jay Rabinowitz.Another crucial element of the film is the haunting music by Clint Mantell, which will stay with the viewer long after the film is over.The film stars Hugh Jackman as Tomas Seville / Tom Creo and Rachel Weisz as Queen Isabel / Izzi Creo. The talented supporting cast features Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Stephen McHattie, and Cliff Curtis. Still, there's no doubt that it's the performances of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz that propel the story forward.In the year 1,500 A.D. Queen Isabel of Spain suffers under the reign of terror that was the Grand Inquisition. She turns to her most valiant warrior, Tomas Seville, to save Spain from bondage and in return she will give him her hand in marriage. The queen believes that the Tree of Life grows in New Spain (or South America), and that whoever drinks the sap from this tree shall be given immortality. This, she believes, is her only hope of saving herself and her country from the wrath of the sanctimonious grand inquisitor, Silecio. So Tomas gathers together the bravest of the conquistadors and travels to New Spain in search of the fabled Tree of Life... but the dangers that await him may prove too great even for this noble warrior who faithfully serves his queen.In the year 2,000 A.D. a doctor named Tom Creo searches for a way to save his dying wife Izzi, who has an inoperable brain tumor. But as Izzi's health declines she finds a spiritual awakening in the legends of the ancient Mayan culture. These legends revive memories of a past life and inspire Izzi to write a novel that will help Tom cope with her inevitable death. All the while, Tom is consumed with grief and obsessively continues his research with an enzyme found in a rare South American tree.In the year 2,500 A.D. Tom travels through space with the tree he planted over Izzi's grave. Haunted by images from their past, he meditates on loss and what it means to live and die. As Tom drifts ever closer to Xibalba, a dying star that is enshrouded in a nebula, he learns the truth about immortality. Most importantly Tom learns to let go and understand the importance of physical death.In the end (if there really can be one), The Fountain is about a love shared between two soul mates, a love that transcends life and death, time and space.Also recommended:Somewhere in TimeBrazil12 MonkeysWhat Dreams May ComeDonnie DarkoMulholland DriveRiverworldThe PrestigePan's Labyrinth",4,The Road to Awe,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,3207,"['Director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'created', 'niche', 'film', 'industry', 'Much', 'filmmakers', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Vincent', 'Ward', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'realm', 'dark', 'drama', 'where', 'dreams', 'fantasies', 'flow', 'everyday', 'reality', 'film', 'Fountain', 'ambitious', 'science', 'fiction/fantasy', 'film', 'strong', 'metaphysical', 'undercurrent', 'always', 'Aronofsky', 'keen', 'visual', 'sense', 'storytelling', 'focusing', 'characterization', 'maintaining', 'emotional', 'momentum', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'together', 'unique', 'narrative', 'structure', 'three', 'different', 'timeframes', 'storytelling', 'device', 'can', 'partly', 'be', 'accredited', 'Aronofsky', 'most', 'praise', 'should', 'go', 'film', 'appreciated', 'editor', 'Jay', 'Rabinowitz.Another', 'crucial', 'element', 'film', 'haunting', 'music', 'Clint', 'Mantell', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'long', 'film', 'over.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Tomas', 'Seville', '/', 'Tom', 'Creo', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Queen', 'Isabel', '/', 'Izzi', 'Creo', 'talented', 'supporting', 'cast', 'features', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Mark', 'Margolis', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Still', 'doubt', 'performances', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'propel', 'story', 'year', '1,500', 'A.D.', 'Queen', 'Isabel', 'Spain', 'suffers', 'reign', 'terror', 'was', 'Grand', 'Inquisition', 'most', 'valiant', 'warrior', 'Tomas', 'Seville', 'save', 'Spain', 'bondage', 'return', 'will', 'give', 'hand', 'marriage', 'queen', 'Tree', 'Life', 'grows', 'New', 'Spain', 'South', 'America', 'sap', 'tree', 'shall', 'be', 'given', 'immortality', 'only', 'hope', 'saving', 'country', 'wrath', 'sanctimonious', 'grand', 'inquisitor', 'Silecio', 'So', 'Tomas', 'gathers', 'together', 'bravest', 'conquistadors', 'travels', 'New', 'Spain', 'search', 'fabled', 'Tree', 'Life', 'dangers', 'await', 'may', 'prove', 'too', 'great', 'even', 'noble', 'warrior', 'who', 'faithfully', 'queen.In', 'year', '2,000', 'A.D.', 'doctor', 'named', 'Tom', 'Creo', 'searches', 'way', 'save', 'dying', 'wife', 'Izzi', 'who', 'inoperable', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Izzi', 'health', 'spiritual', 'awakening', 'legends', 'ancient', 'Mayan', 'culture', 'legends', 'revive', 'memories', 'past', 'life', 'inspire', 'Izzi', 'write', 'novel', 'will', 'help', 'Tom', 'cope', 'inevitable', 'death', 'while', 'Tom', 'consumed', 'grief', 'obsessively', 'research', 'enzyme', 'found', 'rare', 'South', 'American', 'year', '2,500', 'A.D.', 'Tom', 'space', 'tree', 'planted', 'over', 'Izzi', 'grave', 'Haunted', 'images', 'past', 'loss', 'what', 'live', 'die', 'Tom', 'drifts', 'ever', 'closer', 'Xibalba', 'dying', 'star', 'enshrouded', 'nebula', 'truth', 'immortality', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Tom', 'let', 'go', 'understand', 'importance', 'physical', 'death.In', 'end', 'really', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'Fountain', 'love', 'shared', 'two', 'soul', 'mates', 'love', 'life', 'death', 'time', 'space.Also', 'recommended', 'Somewhere', 'TimeBrazil12', 'MonkeysWhat', 'Dreams', 'May', 'ComeDonnie', 'DarkoMulholland', 'DriveRiverworldThe', 'PrestigePan', 'Labyrinth']",N/A

No kidding. That's what happens when you fly directly toward a dying star.

I enjoyed the story within a story approach! I also like brave movies, which are surrealistic and leave much to the imagination like2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray].The cinematography is rich and inventive. I think Salvador Dali would have greatly enjoyed this film!Oh, and the music still pulsates through my soul! It reaches deep, and I'm adding the soundtrack to my collection. The music is so magnificent, I feel it's the best part of the entire movie! It deserves an Oscar nomination!I was also deeply moved by the Tree of Life theme that runs through the entire movie. It so enchanted me that I did some research. Not only is The Tree of Life a part of the rich mythology from the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is also a significant aspect of the ancient Mayan culture! I find that absolutely fascinating, so much so, that I purchased an obscure video documentary,The Tree of Lifedirected by Bruce Lane!While it would be very easy to criticize this unique film for it's various shortcomings, I much rather concentrate on its many strengths.

The Fountain is a breathtaking sentimental masterpiece in the vein of2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray] as it boldly seeks to answer the great mysteries of life, love, death and re-birth transgressing the metaphysical boundaries of the universe. It's epic non-linear narrative spans the centuries with Hugh Jackman delivering an absolutely unforgettable performance as Tomas, a Spanish Conquistador in the 16th century who pledges his loyalty to Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) to find the mythical Tree of Life so that Spain will hold the key to the Fourth Paradise, Immortality, denounced as heresy by the Grand Inquisitor. Tomas' quest is interleaved between three converging narratives across time and space. As a modern-day neurosurgeon, Tomas struggles to find a cure for a tumorous disease that threatens the mortality of his beloved wife Izzi who is writing a fable called ""The Fountain"" chronicling the odyssey of their 16th century quest which can be interpreted as either a fictitious or biographical account of Tomas and Izzi's lives who have endured the centuries together or simply as mythical characterizations of Izzi's unfinished allegorical manuscript symbolizing her husband's obsessive quest to find a cure for her terminal ailment that she has left for him to finish (the past representing Izzi's tale and the future representing Tomas' as he struggles to ""finish it"") both of which could be argued with equal measure. One of the beauties of The Fountain is its open-ended narrative construct left to speculation and interpretation and can be viewed from entirely different perspectives with each consecutive viewing. Tomas' quest ultimately takes him to the distant 26th century where he has projected himself and the dying Tree of Life across the great void of space in a transcendental bubble to reach Xibalba, the name of the Mayan underworld given to a dying nebula that brings the creation of new life from the wake of its destruction like the yin and yang of the cosmos beyond the confines of this mortal coil. ""Our bodies are prisons for our souls. All flesh decays... death turns all to ash. And thus, death frees every soul... ""Darren Aronofsky's poetic film blossoms with rich cultural, biblical, mythical and spiritual imagery that speak the common language spoken by all religions and cultures that have asked the boldest philosophical questions about our place in the universe since time immemorial. For anyone who has ever looked to the heavens and stared in the face of mortality and beyond, The Fountain holds all of the answers to life like a profound epiphany radiating from the heavens.

647919,AUEHG0DB54B7K,B00005JPAR,David A. Wend,"[5, 7]","The first thing my wife said about The Fountain on the way out of the theater was that the film looked a lot like 2001: A Space Odyssey.  There is a definite feel of  Stanley Kubrick in The Fountain from the visual effects, particularly the scene set as Hugh Jackman travels in space.  The story is set over 1000 years covering a16th century Conquistador Tomas who is searching for a way to save the Queen of Spain, a doctor, named Tommy, trying to cure his wife Isabel (Izzy) of cancer and Tom, a 26th century space traveler heading toward a nebula that will explode to give birth to a planetary system and new life.The three stories cut into each other, a task that must have been difficult in a film with such an abstract story, and there is interaction between the stories.  Izzy writes a chronicle of her 16th century life and Tomas' quest for the Tree of Life but does not finish her manuscript; that is left for Tommy to do.  Tommy, ironically, in searching for a cure for Izzy's cancer tries an experimental drug on a monkey named Donavan, whose fatal brain tumor not only shrinks but grants immortality.  However, this was not the cure that Tommy wants, at first; Izzy is dead before Tommy realizes that he could have saved her.  In the 26th century, Tom is traveling with a slowly dying Tree of Life to Xilbalba, the Mayan underworld where in destruction life is reborn.  Viewers who demand that a story to be told chronologically will probably be disappointed at the way the film cuts back and forth between stories.  The Fountain is a spiritual journey into immortality; our search for a cure for all our physical maladies until we conquer death itself.  I found myself drawn into the ideas of the film as it progressed; it is a film that provokes thinking and discussionThis film truly belongs to writer-director Darren Aronofsky  who spent seven years making the movie, a road with a lot of bumps along the way.  Hugh Jackman turns in a magnificent performance displaying a full range of emotion from joy, sorrow and ecstasy.  I found myself accepting him completely as the people he was playing.

I watched it because of the actors, but as soon as I saw what type of movie it was, I just did an eye roll, as I normally hate these types of films. The director normally loses the focus of the movie, and it ends up being a psychedelic mess. I hung in there because of the actors, and I'm glad I did. I will add this to my collection. It may look like it throws Christianity out the window in favor of Buddhism, but if you understand your Bible correctly (following Jesus's teachings, not Paul's), then you'll see it come back full circle to Genesis. This is first and foremost a love story. At the end, keep in mind this is the true meaning of life, so don't expect a fairy tale Disney moment. Because most of us are brainwashed that way from birth, the ending leaves you feeling a little sad, even though logic tells you to be happy. The two lovers keep being reborn, always find each other, and then lose each other. Now, is enlightenment just being at peace with that knowledge that you will always be together again, or as religions tell it that your soul/essence/being will always be connected in the collective? Does nature show us it's the same thing? Whatever the answers are, our characters finally find peace, and are happy with what that is. That is the happy ending.

It is, however, a little melodramatic and preachy in places, and the slow, mournful string concertos playing over and over again in the background tend to overdo the intended mood of THE FOUNTAIN.

There are reasons for this, of course, but all the darkness requires the audience to adjust their senses and heightens the somber mood even more. Just a little more daylight in key places would have been a plus.Nevertheless, THE FOUNTAIN intelligently takes on some big heady concepts, most importantly, our desire for immortality. As medical researcher Tommy explains, ""Death is a disease, just like any other. There is a cure, and I will find it!"" Does he succeed? It's all debatable, and THE FOUNTAIN does a nice job of showing and telling us just enough while also leaving just enough for the individual viewer to interpret. There are a number of interesting hints regarding the possibility of reincarnation and, barring that, how we live on regardless of whether we continue to live physically and literally.THE FOUNTAIN seems like another obscurantist trying-so-hard-to-be-brilliant film at first, but if you stick with it past the initial 10-15 minutes, the three interrelated past-present-future stories come together very well.

You need to prepare yourself for a visual experience that rivals Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. You need to surrender yourself to Aronofsky's vision.

Just watch ""Pi"" and ""Requiem For a Dream,"" and you'll see why this underrated director has made one of the most astounding sci-fi movies in ages.""The Fountain"" is basically a sprawling tale that is half ""real,"" half outside the mind -- love, immortality, death, grief and a tangled plotline that may take a few viewings to get right, but is exquisite in its simplicity. Not satisfied with depth, Aronofsky also makes it an absolutely stunning visual experience.Research oncologist Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cancer cure by animal testing, so he can save the life of his dying wife Izzie (Rachel Weisz), including an unsanctioned test from a mysterious tree. As she hopes for a cure, Izzie has been writing a book about a Spanish conquistador who is seeking the immortality-granting Tree of Life.As we see in other flashbacks, that conquistador is a version of Tommy (and Izzy as Queen Isabella). And far in the future, Tommy still struggles with his wife's loss, as he travels to a distant nebula to revive the tree. But as he finally gives in to his wife's last wish, he becomes enmeshed in a mysterious rebirth that stretches through the ages.""The Fountain"" got a royal whupping from critics, and was even booed by test audiences, who presumably couldn't understand the three storylines -- or rather, one non-linear storyline, in which the lines between reality and imagination are blurred. Perhaps all of it is true, or perhaps Tommy's mind is creating the 1500 and 2500 scenarios to help him cope.As befits a movie that tackles so many deep themes, Aronofsky weaves mythology, creation beliefs, religion and the fear of death together, and binds it together with the universal theme -- love that even death can't overcome. The dialogue tends to be more spare than the story, rather than loading it down with unnecessary ponderings.And he does it beautifully and surreally. The whole movie is tinged in gold -- gold light, gold costumes, gold Tree of Life, gold nebula, gold deserts. The camerawork is filmed poetry: there are sweet moments like planting a seed in a grave, the Tree lit by the sun, and the sight of Tommy inside the nebula. The most exquisite moment comes when Tommy kneels before Izzy, under the Tree, with drops of golden light falling around them.This is undoubtedly Jackman's best movie, making us feel Tom's love and sorrow for Izzy (""There's no hope for us here. There is only death""), and the lifelong struggle against death. Your heart really breaks for him. Weisz is sweet and wilting as Izzy, and the chemistry between the two leads makes their time-busting love seem entirely reasonable.Aronofsky has made a story that is pure art, exquisite in theme, and while you might have to watch ""Fountain"" a few times to really ""get it,"" but you won't regret the experience. Even if you don't like it, in an era of bland popcorn movies, its ambition is worth praising.",5,To love forever,1174089600,"03 17, 2007",2007,2977,"['Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'never', 'made', 'movies', 'were', 'easy', 'viewing', 'Examples', 'Just', 'watch', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'underrated', 'director', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'astounding', 'sci-fi', 'movies', 'ages', 'Fountain', 'basically', 'sprawling', 'tale', 'half', 'real', 'half', 'mind', 'love', 'immortality', 'death', 'grief', 'tangled', 'plotline', 'may', 'take', 'few', 'viewings', 'get', 'right', 'exquisite', 'simplicity', 'Not', 'satisfied', 'depth', 'Aronofsky', 'also', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'visual', 'experience.Research', 'oncologist', 'Tommy', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'trying', 'find', 'cancer', 'cure', 'animal', 'testing', 'can', 'save', 'life', 'dying', 'wife', 'Izzie', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'including', 'unsanctioned', 'test', 'mysterious', 'tree', 'cure', 'Izzie', 'been', 'writing', 'book', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'who', 'seeking', 'immortality-granting', 'Tree', 'Life.As', 'see', 'other', 'flashbacks', 'conquistador', 'version', 'Tommy', 'Izzy', 'Queen', 'Isabella', 'far', 'future', 'Tommy', 'still', 'wife', 'loss', 'distant', 'nebula', 'revive', 'tree', 'finally', 'wife', 'last', 'wish', 'enmeshed', 'mysterious', 'rebirth', 'ages', 'Fountain', 'got', 'royal', 'whupping', 'critics', 'was', 'even', 'booed', 'test', 'audiences', 'who', 'presumably', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'three', 'storylines', 'rather', 'one', 'non-linear', 'storyline', 'lines', 'reality', 'imagination', 'are', 'blurred', 'Perhaps', 'true', 'perhaps', 'Tommy', 'mind', 'creating', '1500', '2500', 'scenarios', 'help', 'cope.As', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'deep', 'themes', 'Aronofsky', 'mythology', 'creation', 'beliefs', 'religion', 'fear', 'death', 'together', 'together', 'universal', 'theme', 'love', 'even', 'death', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overcome', 'dialogue', 'be', 'more', 'spare', 'story', 'rather', 'loading', 'down', 'unnecessary', 'ponderings.And', 'beautifully', 'surreally', 'whole', 'movie', 'tinged', 'gold', 'gold', 'light', 'gold', 'costumes', 'gold', 'Tree', 'Life', 'gold', 'nebula', 'gold', 'deserts', 'camerawork', 'filmed', 'poetry', 'are', 'sweet', 'moments', 'planting', 'seed', 'grave', 'Tree', 'lit', 'sun', 'sight', 'Tommy', 'nebula', 'most', 'exquisite', 'moment', 'when', 'Tommy', 'kneels', 'Izzy', 'Tree', 'drops', 'golden', 'light', 'falling', 'them.This', 'undoubtedly', 'Jackman', 'best', 'movie', 'making', 'feel', 'Tom', 'love', 'sorrow', 'Izzy', 'hope', 'here', 'only', 'death', 'lifelong', 'struggle', 'death', 'heart', 'really', 'breaks', 'Weisz', 'sweet', 'wilting', 'Izzy', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'time-busting', 'love', 'seem', 'entirely', 'reasonable.Aronofsky', 'made', 'story', 'pure', 'art', 'exquisite', 'theme', 'might', 'have', 'watch', 'Fountain', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'experience', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'era', 'bland', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'ambition', 'worth', 'praising']",N/A

The way he unfolds all three stories (past, present, and future) into one coherent whole is something that we don't regularly see in films these days. The overall vision of The Fountain reminds me of Stanley Kubrick: I'm not saying that Aronofsky is nowhere near as good as Kubrick (who is one of my favorite directors), but Aronofsky does seem like the new Kubrick of our generation. I'm hoping he continues to make these sorts of films so that they could dazzle us straight through.The only problems I had with the film were the extreme closeups of Jackman and Weisz. They were so close to the camera that I sometimes had to look away. But nonetheless, Jackman and Weisz gives astonishing performances. Jackman especially knows how to look and act like an obsessive man who will stop at nothing in finding eternal life. He should've been nominated for an Oscar, or at least a Golden Globe.So mix in Aronofsky's visual creativeness, Jackman and Weisz's great acting, Clint Mansell's minimal and often meditative music score, and you've got a visual masterpiece.

Third time I saw it was on my plasma with 5.1 surround sound and it was awesome!In a nutshell: He's in the future remembering the ""present"" and his wife is writing about the past and all three stories converge.But the story is so much more than that. Its a mixture of Christianity and pagan mysticism. A theme of life blossoming from death.First off, each time I become more impressed with Hugh Jackman's acting in this flick. He deserves an oscar nomination. This is ligh-years beyond (pun intended) his ""acting"" as Wolverine or anything else I remember seeing him in.Racheal Weiz always does a fantastic job, and thankfully a much more upbeat character than in the Constant Gardner in my opinion.The second greatest part of this movie after the acting is the writing. The story is full, I mean full of symbolism and metaphores.As the three stories unfold and the parallels between them become clearer; the viewer becomes transported into an emotional nuclear explosion as you you get hit with the message of the theme and glory of discovery from not one but three stories at the same time. A masterfully imaginative and well written script. Another oscar should be awarded for the screenplay.The music and visuals I'll throw into my final point. The music pulls at the emotions as it is choregraphed expertly with storyline. As the visual and musical climax with the story's climax, it hits you hard and leaves you stuttering the word, ""w-w-Wow!!"".OVERALL:This is in my top 10 all time favorite movies now.Its a thinking person's movie and takes more than one sitting for most to ""get it"". Each viewing you'll pick up on more details and can grow to appreciate this movie on a new level.

647963,A12WZTC4YJ8ZEC,B00005JPAR,Ethan D Van Vorst,"[2, 5]","Did you know that most libraries have movies and tv series on VHS or DVD? This came as something of a surprise to me until my wife, who is a librarian, started bringing home some DVD's for viewing. She says that they're largely ""contributions"" from various patrons, which explains why most of them are usually not that good. Thus it can be surmised that one local patron considered ""The Fountain"" as weird and at times incomprehensible as I did, and quickly ""donated"" it to the local library.I've seen some really weird films in my day, but this one ranks right up there with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", whose ending I still to this day have not been able to figure out. When the wife brought it home from the library and said ""It's got the romance angle for me and some action for you, according to the back of the box"", I should have known better, but I played along. The film stars Hugh Jackman (Wolverine from ""X-Men"") and Rachel Weisz (the lovable librarian heroine from ""The Mummy"" movies) as his dying wife. Jackman's characer, Tom Creo, is a research doctor who is trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, who inadvertantly stumbles across a concoction that imbues upon test subjects seeming eternal youth. Tom wants no part of that nonsense as he's after the cure for cancer, not agelessness, despite numerous objections from his medical staff and his boss, who throws unintentional roadblocks in front of him from time to time. The finding of the cure for his wife's illness has clearly become an obsession for Tom and he forgoes all other things (including his wife's affections for the most part) in his race to come up with a cure overnight.Now, that plot sounds reasonably cogent, right? The director, Darren Aronofsky, then injects two side-stories into the mix, which tends to muddy up the waters a bit and can make following this otherwise beautifully styled movie into something a bit confusing. First there's the side story of Tomas, a Spanish conquistador (Jackman) who is given the quest of finding the lost Tree of Life by Queen Isabella (Weisz) which is located somewhere in the New World in the realms of the Mayan people.Then there's a third bizarre side story of a bald and tattooed Jackman flying through space in a giant bubble with a tree in it heading towards the Orion Nebula. This portion of the movie was definitely the most off-putting and perplexing to both me and my wife as it contains the most meta-physical aspect of what the director was trying to say in the movie.And what exactly was he trying to say? Well, you see, the movie is about how we deal with death, and eternal life, as well as reincarnation (sort of) and an abundance of spiritual themes. The manner in which he tries to show us how these themes interweave is what most people will probably find confusing as he uses three separate stories to tell the same tale. Consider the ""Tomas the Conquistador"" story to be straight allegory of Dr. Tom Creo's quest for the cure. The spacy ""Tom in the Bubble"" story is a more spiritual symbolic translation of this quest. Each is designed to look at the same story through different styles, and all tend to interweave with the others.But it is very confusing and off-putting, as I mentioned earlier, and a lot of people who view it aren't going to A. Get it, or B. Like the way the story/s are told. For his part Jackman was a very sympathetic and grounded individual whose character you can't help but like in any of their 3 respective incarnations, but poor Rachel Weisz...her characters (Queen Isabella, Izzy the dying wife, or ""Space Tree"") all come off as portraying her as a kind of otherworldly weirdo. More than once my wife and I exchanged puzzled and none too perplexed looks at each other after hearing some of her rather hokum-enriched and spooky comments. In fact it was our impression that she wasn't entirely banging on all cylinders, which is sad since we're supposed to feel sympathetic for her character. This is impossible to fulfill totally when the person you're supposed to feel sympathy for has a nasty side-tendency to creep you out a little bit at the same time. Kind of like Carrot Top.To those who leave comments that suggest that I'm ""too dumb"" to see the beauty and true meaning of the movie, I feel I've explained this adequately enough in such a fashion that proves that I am not too dumb to understand. On the contrary, I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish and applaud his attempt, it's just that the ultimate screen version is a bit too new-agey for a traditional ""I like plots that make sense"" kind of guy like me. If that kind of movie is your cup of tea then you'll love this movie. If it's not, as with me and my wife, then you'll probably want to keep browsing for something else.",3,Quirky movie,1197244800,"12 10, 2007",2007,4781,"['Did', 'know', 'most', 'libraries', 'have', 'movies', 'tv', 'series', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'came', 'something', 'surprise', 'wife', 'who', 'librarian', 'started', 'bringing', 'home', 'DVD', 'viewing', ""'re"", 'largely', 'contributions', 'various', 'patrons', 'why', 'most', 'are', 'usually', 'not', 'good', 'Thus', 'can', 'be', 'surmised', 'one', 'local', 'patron', 'considered', 'Fountain', 'weird', 'times', 'incomprehensible', 'did', 'quickly', 'donated', 'local', 'library.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'really', 'weird', 'films', 'day', 'one', 'ranks', 'right', 'up', 'there', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'ending', 'still', 'day', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'When', 'wife', 'brought', 'home', 'library', 'said', 'got', 'romance', 'angle', 'action', 'according', 'back', 'box', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'better', 'played', 'along', 'film', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Wolverine', 'X-Men', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'lovable', 'librarian', 'heroine', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'dying', 'wife', 'Jackman', 'characer', 'Tom', 'Creo', 'research', 'doctor', 'who', 'trying', 'find', 'cure', 'wife', 'cancer', 'who', 'inadvertantly', 'concoction', 'test', 'subjects', 'seeming', 'eternal', 'youth', 'Tom', 'part', 'nonsense', 'cure', 'cancer', 'not', 'agelessness', 'numerous', 'objections', 'medical', 'staff', 'boss', 'who', 'unintentional', 'roadblocks', 'front', 'time', 'time', 'finding', 'cure', 'wife', 'illness', 'clearly', 'become', 'obsession', 'Tom', 'other', 'things', 'including', 'wife', 'affections', 'most', 'part', 'race', 'come', 'up', 'cure', 'overnight.Now', 'plot', 'reasonably', 'cogent', 'right', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'then', 'two', 'side-stories', 'mix', 'muddy', 'up', 'waters', 'bit', 'can', 'make', 'following', 'otherwise', 'beautifully', 'styled', 'movie', 'something', 'bit', 'confusing', 'First', 'side', 'story', 'Tomas', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'Jackman', 'who', 'given', 'quest', 'finding', 'lost', 'Tree', 'Life', 'Queen', 'Isabella', 'Weisz', 'located', 'somewhere', 'New', 'World', 'realms', 'Mayan', 'people.Then', 'third', 'bizarre', 'side', 'story', 'bald', 'tattooed', 'Jackman', 'flying', 'space', 'giant', 'bubble', 'tree', 'heading', 'Orion', 'Nebula', 'portion', 'movie', 'was', 'definitely', 'most', 'off-putting', 'perplexing', 'wife', 'most', 'meta-physical', 'aspect', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'movie.And', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'Well', 'see', 'movie', 'how', 'deal', 'death', 'eternal', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'reincarnation', 'sort', 'abundance', 'spiritual', 'themes', 'manner', 'show', 'how', 'themes', 'interweave', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'confusing', 'three', 'separate', 'stories', 'tell', 'same', 'tale', 'Consider', 'Tomas', 'Conquistador', 'story', 'be', 'straight', 'allegory', 'Dr.', 'Tom', 'Creo', 'quest', 'cure', 'spacy', 'Tom', 'Bubble', 'story', 'more', 'spiritual', 'symbolic', 'translation', 'quest', 'designed', 'look', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'styles', 'tend', 'interweave', 'others.But', 'very', 'confusing', 'off-putting', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'view', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'A', 'Get', 'B', 'way', 'story/s', 'are', 'told', 'part', 'Jackman', 'was', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'grounded', 'individual', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'like', '3', 'respective', 'incarnations', 'poor', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'characters', 'Queen', 'Isabella', 'Izzy', 'dying', 'wife', 'Space', 'Tree', 'come', 'off', 'portraying', 'kind', 'otherworldly', 'weirdo', 'More', 'once', 'wife', 'exchanged', 'puzzled', 'none', 'too', 'perplexed', 'looks', 'other', 'hearing', 'rather', 'hokum-enriched', 'spooky', 'comments', 'fact', 'was', 'impression', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'banging', 'cylinders', 'sad', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'impossible', 'fulfill', 'totally', 'when', 'person', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'nasty', 'side-tendency', 'creep', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'same', 'time', 'Kind', 'Carrot', 'Top.To', 'who', 'leave', 'comments', 'suggest', ""'m"", 'too', 'dumb', 'see', 'beauty', 'true', 'meaning', 'movie', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'explained', 'adequately', 'enough', 'such', 'fashion', 'am', 'not', 'too', 'dumb', 'understand', 'contrary', 'appreciate', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'accomplish', 'applaud', 'attempt', 'just', 'ultimate', 'screen', 'version', 'bit', 'too', 'new-agey', 'traditional', 'like', 'plots', 'make', 'sense', 'kind', 'guy', 'kind', 'movie', 'cup', 'tea', 'then', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'not', 'wife', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'keep', 'browsing', 'something', 'else']",N/A

I learned that you should not eat too much from the tree, or you will become one.  I also learned that the earth needs more help (like not shaving too much - less razors to cut the ground)!!  Wolverine is a man who sometimes floats in space (I think to be punished for using the tree for shaving) and other timings is staring at a woman who is fuzzy.  It reminds me of the show with Mr. Bruce Willes and the woman from the 80's who solved mysteries - much like Wolverine tries solving for the fizzy woman in the movie!!

I agree with an earlier reviewer that this is not Sci-Fi.  It is metaphysical.  The heroine has written a book about a quest of two lovers for eternal life.  We see the story of the book entertwined with the present day events.  The book is unfinished, and she has asked her lover to finish it.  The futuristic version is his attempt to do so.  He is emotionally traumatized, and these story lines are woven together as memory haunts him, and he struggles to reach acceptance.

647983,A13TO5TU4A68LD,B00005JPAR,Gryphonisle,"[2, 3]","""The Fountain"" is a movie that unfolds in three sections, all of which are related (the Tree of LIfe) although they don't necessarily work together to forward the plot.  The main story is a fairly tragic love story between an oncologist and his beautiful young wife, who is dying of cancer.  He's not just a doctor though, he's also a scientist, and his race through animal tests to find a cure eventually succeed, but...  These  characters are pretty to look at, live and work in dark but pretty surroundings, but mostly just smile and moon over each other so the audience doesn't quite form the attraction to them that would have made the movie work with this story alone, so, another layer is added, from a book the wife is writing called ""The Fountain"" (which, like the movie, is about the Tree Of Life, not a fountain).  The book is set in the Spanish Inquisition and features something of a love story between Queen Isabella and a Conquistador (also played by Jackman and Weisz) where he goes off to find the actual tree, in Mayan lands.  This story---the book---is performed, instead of being read by one the characters, so it could be mistaken for part of the real-life timeline of the story and probably is, by some.  It's not all that confusing, or shouldn't be to anyone paying attention in the least.The third ""story"" is more of a moving image with minimal dialog.  A bubble of unknown construction is floating in space, into a nebula, a dying star the movie identifies as the source of the Mayan Creation Story.  Jackman and Weisz show up here too, and the tree seems to take on the role of Weisz after (spoiler avoidance).  It seems that by taking the tree to the dying star it will be reborn as the star explodes.  Jackman by now has lost his hair---all of it, even the five o clock shadow, and is alternately shown in the bubble in black space-age meditation clothes, and, floating about, meditating out of the bubble.  How they got there, when this part of the movie takes place, and why the tree of life itself has to die to live, let alone how it's going to live in outer space amidst an exploding nebula is the sort of ""Hollywood twaddle"" that drives a lot of people crazy..But as others have noted, it does indeed look pretty.  Not Kubrik stunning, it goes on way too long for that level of drama to be sustained, but it is pretty.Over-all, this is modern entertainment which aspires to being so much more than it is.  Like ""Lost"" it uses cherry picked spiritualism from different religions to add an air of spiritualistic mystery in order to give depth to a story that lacks it.  ""The Fountain"" at its heart, is a tragic love story that isn't developed enough to stand on its own;  by adding two other stories that are essentially also free-standing, but unable to stand on their own either doesn't help.  In short, it's a very wobbly three legged table, don't set too much on it.

647986,APRVKZZLIZUSJ,B00005JPAR,"Handsome-Jeff Friedberg, an Author and Media-...","[4, 5]","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!But it's just my interpretwtion---everyone will have their own....Unquestionably Darren Aronofsky is a genius--but he's an artistic genius, which is different, much edgier.There is nothing in this work that is not brilliantly symbolic of something else. Soft orange electric lamps are like the lambent torchlight of other sequences in past eras. A great mystic tree is the Tree Of Life, the World Tree of many diverse mythologies. Snow is death and a harbinger of it. A story is written in an old fashioned notebook that must be unbound to be opened and read, just as life is a mystery to be unlocked and read. Even a monkey named Donovan has his use (Donovan's Brain, 1953.) You get the idea.Look for the magnificently layered feast of imagery, symbolism, and mythology Aronofsky serves up. It is as thrilling and emotionally overwhelming as its exquisitely unresolved musical score, endlessly dark, poignant, forward-moving, unending.The Fountain is a work in three acts, with three separate--yet blended--components in each act that are revealed simultaneously. A brilliant young scientist and researcher, Tom, seeks to conquer death in time to save his dying wife, Izzi; for him, ""death is a disease"" that needs to be cured. This is his life when it was ordinary for him, before passing over a threshold from which he can never returnIn a harmonic insertion, his dying wife, Izzi, is writing a book with old time fountain pen and ink, a mystic Romance of love, conquest, and death that takes place in Spain during the Inquisition. All but the last chapter is finished, which she wants Tom to write after she's gone, ""Finish it..."" is her recurrent refrain. Izzi's book serves as an explanatory supplemental structure, lattice, or parable for their mutual battle or acceptance of or against her own imminent death: she is resigned to death; he never can be.Tom views this tragic love story from his present, his point of view, which appears to us as the future. Like pages turned back from the future, Tom, made immortal by the medicinal bark of the mystic tree, looks back on all this--his past ordinary life as a scientist researcher--his life and love with the now deceased Izzi. Also, from out of the future, Tom dreams his ""role"" as a character in Izzi's book, a devoted Conquistador who battles death itself--and discovers immortality in a mystic Mayan Tree Of Life.But Tom--reluctant here in the future--must eventually pass through a---to him---terrifying doorway of no return to achieve his Goal. He wrestles with his own imminent personal conquest of death here in the future, which is to receive death, by choice, like a gladiator sworn to his oath might receive death, not willingly, but with acceptance and duty.This is a complex presentation. How does all this come about, movie-wise?As the film plays through, Tom's point of view shifts through time and space--and therefore reality--from his (futristic) present to his own past, but also through imagination and visualization as he reads Izzi's book, which is another realm, of form and idea, where he is symbolized by the unnamed Conquistador.In The Fountain, the Present is actually taking place only in the ""futuristic"" scenes, where Tom--immortal--is in a trans-stellar container, a ""bubble"" or egg that falls endlessly through space toward a dying star which will go nova. When Izzi died--four hundred years ago, Tom planted a seed-pod over her grave, which grew into a great mystic tree that numinously now holds her life force and soul. This is nuanced and foreshadowed frequently by The Tree Of Life theme that weaves through the movie--death and regeneration, a mythology of planting and harvest, not of the hunter-killer. Tom has that great tree with him in a star-craft which journeys now through space toward its dark destination.Tom and his vehicle are meant to be reminiscent of the Star Child that awaited rebirth in the movie 2001. Tom's conveyance contains him and also the great tree that grew long ago and, Druid-like, drove its roots into the Under World of Izzi's grave. It now holds the life-force or soul of Izzi. Its medicinal bark, or her essence, is what keeps Tom alive, or progressing, through time as he journeys toward his destiny.Izzi's ghostly leitmotif, admonishment and refrain to Tom, ""Finish it,"" means: finish the story--finish your life with death, for Immortality is not Human.Tom flashes back to a scene rerun where Izzi asks him to walk with her in the snow--death--which he refused to do the first time she asked him--in the beginning of the movie. Now, in the future, he chooses to finally take that walk with her into the white expanse of forever.Now, here, in the 25th Century, Tom finally meets that destiny as he sails to the star, Xibalba--the Mayan underworld, which is another recurrent theme. Once Tom and the tree of life reach Xibalba, the star explodes, and Tom and Izzi (the Tree Of Life) are utterly uncreated--yet merge in cosmic completion, where they will not ""live forever,"" but, rather, will exist together for Eternity.Eternity contains Forever within it, and is absent from both time and space. Therefore, they don't live for eternity, but they are together in Eternity, with the Great Source Of All Things.",5,CONTAINS SPOILERS,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",2011,5269,"['THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS',

I was tempted to read reviews and glad , instead  that my eyes watched the film untainted and in utter enchantment.  This film fits no genre and cannot be cataloged with ease.  As an artist, I was enraptured by the surrealism.  Some scenes are the most awe-inspiring organic moments ever captured on film.  Others bring to mind the tormented yet serene imagery of Dali.  If the film had no sound whatsoever, I would have loved it enough based solely on it's appearance.The love story of The Fountain is majestic and mysterious.  This is a love that transcends time and space.  If you focus on the multi-linear aspect of the plot, you will lose the fragility of the love between the characters.  Prepare to be overwhelmed with emotion and imagery - this is eye candy for the philosophical sci-fi lover.  The Fountain encompasses many ideas, emotions, and imagery-perhaps too much for a two-hour film, but I loved it nonetheless.  In my theater seat I was whisked away to Spain, catapulted to the distant stars of the Universe, and grounded by the nature of human existence and love.  In two hours my brain felt as if it had absorbed a library of new emotion-feelings yet to have been branded with a name as simple as ""Love"", ""Hate"", or ""Jealousy"".  I enjoyed The Fountain very much.  I anticipated an immortal love story but saw and experienced much more.  Not since seeing  ""The Passion of Christ"" the day of its release have I been witness to so much silence and introspective chatter at the end of a film. This was a miraculous vision boldly brought to film.Other films you might like if you like ""The Fountain"" : ""Mirrormask"", ""Pi"", ""Donnie Darko"", ""LadyHawke"", or ""Aeon Flux""",5,A Leap of Faith,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,1745,"['had', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'view', 'film', 'was', 'tempted', 'read', 'reviews', 'glad', 'instead', 'eyes', 'watched', 'film', 'untainted', 'utter', 'enchantment', 'film', 'genre', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cataloged', 'ease', 'artist', 'was', 'enraptured', 'surrealism', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'awe-inspiring', 'organic', 'moments', 'ever', 'captured', 'film', 'Others', 'bring', 'mind', 'tormented', 'yet', 'serene', 'imagery', 'Dali', 'film', 'had', 'sound', 'whatsoever', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'enough', 'based', 'solely', 'appearance.The', 'love', 'story', 'Fountain', 'majestic', 'mysterious', 'love', 'time', 'space', 'focus', 'multi-linear', 'aspect', 'plot', 'will', 'lose', 'fragility', 'love', 'characters', 'Prepare', 'be', 'overwhelmed', 'emotion', 'imagery', 'eye', 'candy', 'philosophical', 'sci-fi', 'lover', 'Fountain', 'many', 'ideas', 'emotions', 'imagery-perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'two-hour', 'film', 'loved', 'nonetheless', 'theater', 'seat', 'was', 'whisked', 'away', 'Spain', 'catapulted', 'distant', 'stars', 'Universe', 'grounded', 'nature', 'human', 'existence', 'love', 'two', 'hours', 'brain', 'felt', 'had', 'absorbed', 'library', 'new', 'emotion-feelings', 'yet', 'have', 'been', 'branded', 'name', 'as', 'simple', 'Love', 'Hate', 'Jealousy', 'enjoyed', 'Fountain', 'very', 'much', 'anticipated', 'immortal', 'love', 'story', 'saw', 'experienced', 'much', 'more', 'Not', 'seeing', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'day', 'release', 'have', 'been', 'witness', 'so', 'much', 'silence', 'introspective', 'chatter', 'end', 'film', 'was', 'miraculous', 'vision', 'boldly', 'brought', 'film.Other', 'films', 'might', 'like', 'like', 'Fountain', 'Mirrormask', 'Pi', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'LadyHawke', 'Aeon', 'Flux']",N/A

For a film whose footage is primarily low-key, maintaining shadow detail is of the utmost importance, and WB really dropped the ball in that department.

Ultimately, I believe, it is a tale that illustrates how fear of death prevents one from living.The film presents three intertwined stories, each involving a version of Tom, played by Hugh Jackman. In the modern day, ""real"", story line, Dr. Tom Creo is racing against time to find a cure for the cancer that will ultimately claim his wife, Izzi. In another thread, Tom is a Conquistador searching for the Mayan Tree of Life in order to grant immortality to himself and Queen Isabel (who is another version of Izzi.) In the third story line, Tom is a monk-like star voyager in a golden bubble, in which he travels with a giant tree throughout space.The title of the film, ""The Fountain"", is also the title of a novel written by Tom's wife. In it is the tale of the Conquistador and Queen Isabel. Ultimately, it will be up to Tom to finish this work, and doing so will require coming to terms with the nature of life and death.Perhaps the best thing about this film are the visual effects, which, apparently, made minimal use of CGI, and employed more conventional photographic techniques such as macrophotography.The film's presentation leaves the viewer wondering what it is all about, but the experience can be enjoyed by all as a beautiful narrative about death and life.",4,A Visually Beautiful Film,1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,1354,"['Fountain', 'story', 'man', 'coming', 'grips', 'death', 'wife', 'Ultimately', 'believe', 'tale', 'how', 'fear', 'death', 'prevents', 'one', 'living.The', 'film', 'presents', 'three', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'involving', 'version', 'Tom', 'played', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'modern', 'day', 'real', 'story', 'line', 'Dr.', 'Tom', 'Creo', 'racing', 'time', 'find', 'cure', 'cancer', 'will', 'ultimately', 'claim', 'wife', 'Izzi', 'thread', 'Tom', 'Conquistador', 'searching', 'Mayan', 'Tree', 'Life', 'order', 'grant', 'immortality', 'Queen', 'Isabel', 'who', 'version', 'Izzi', 'third', 'story', 'line', 'Tom', 'monk-like', 'star', 'voyager', 'golden', 'bubble', 'giant', 'tree', 'space.The', 'title', 'film', 'Fountain', 'also', 'title', 'novel', 'written', 'Tom', 'wife', 'tale', 'Conquistador', 'Queen', 'Isabel', 'Ultimately', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'Tom', 'finish', 'work', 'doing', 'so', 'will', 'require', 'coming', 'terms', 'nature', 'life', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'are', 'visual', 'effects', 'apparently', 'made', 'minimal', 'use', 'CGI', 'employed', 'more', 'conventional', 'photographic', 'techniques', 'such', 'macrophotography.The', 'film', 'presentation', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'what', 'experience', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'beautiful', 'narrative', 'death', 'life']",N/A

By the time the credits started rolling, my mind was moving a mile a minute trying to decipher what was going on.  At first I was determined to figure it out and make sense of it all, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that perhaps wondering ""what the hell happened"" isn't really the point.The movie is really three movies in one -kind of- with Hugh Jackman doing a very good job at playing all three leads.  We have him in the past as a Spanish Conquistador searching for the fountain of youth, in the present as a scientist trying to find a cure for his wife's cancer, and in the future... well I'm not entirely sure what he's supposed to be, but we'll say an astronaut monk traversing the stars in a bubble containing a dying tree (Let it not be said that Mr Androfsky lacks imagination.) Each thread involves his wife played by Rachel Weisz and his obsession with being with her for eternity.These three parts don't flow in a linear fashion, but toggle back and forth, each coming to a head by the end of the movie.  It's actually not as confusing as it sounds, and I thought I had it mostly figured out... at least until the end when these plot threads start coming to a close.  By the end you're left with many different possible conclusions and the movie can be taken several different ways.  You have to decide what is fantasy and what is reality, but whichever way you take it, the movie tells its message about life and those we love.The acting and scripting in this movie are great.  The imagery is astounding, and from what I hear, done entirely with special effects and no CG whatsoever.  I was captivated by how bizzare and beautiful it is, yet frustrated by the time it was over.  You get the sense that there is something missing, something left unsaid.  I think that's what Androfsky was going for.  Afterall, it is better to leave you wanting more...I recommend this movie to those with an open mind.

There are many moments in the Fountain in which the story is too desperately being explained to us. Rachel Weisz is an amazing actress but half her lines in the movie feel like she's just spoon-feeding us important information. It took the joy away from a movie that should (though mostly does) communicate on an emotional level more than anything else. Even if you don't really know why, The Fountain has the ability to provoke some powerful emotions. Unfortunately, it does not do much else.The plot is in three parts: the first of which chronicling Hugh Jackman's 16th century conquistador Tomas' journey into the heart of the Mayan empire to locate the mythical Tree Of Life and reward himself and Queen Isabella with eternal life so as to escape from a dying Spain, the second is set in the 21st century and sees Tommy as a scientist trying to cure his wife of her cancer and, with help from a strange South American tree, stumbling across a potential cure to ageing. Ageing, but not death. The third plot sees a futuristic Tom escorting a dying Tree Of Life (who would have thought that the Tree could die?) into the heart of a dying nebula where both the tree plans to be reborn. The relationship between the plots is blurred and certainly open to interpretation. There is however certain constants throughout each act as it were. Not counting the obvious themes of life, death and love, there are repeated elements of tragedy and noticeable splashes of shared dialogue, imagery and color (especially gold) throughout each different time period. The romance between Tommy and Izzy, particularly in the 21st century time period, is an heart-breaking portrayal of love and loss.If you were to remove the entire concept of past and future from the movie, you'd have a story of a man with a love so intense for the woman he lost; he would never, ever recover. Since we do get the other, more wondrous aspects to it, The Fountain becomes a more memorable, unique film, and has a beautiful sense of hope to it. It is a very one-sided love story though. It is mainly about Hugh Jackman's character's experiences. Aronosky's wife, the lovely Weisz, has to play a character that is never fully realized, and is degraded to an object of affection and goal for the main character, and someone who lays down all the important information to get the plot rolling.The film is very much a heavy film if you were for its message and visual experience. It isn't a clear cut adventure film, but one which forces viewers to think. I found out that Brad and Cate was suppose to star in this film but apparently went off to do the equally over-ambitious but infinitely superior ""Babel.""  Based around the Biblical Tree of Life described in Genesis, I think it is one of the most original pieces of artistry I have seen in quite sometime, but in the other hand is not as clever or deep as it thinks it is.",4,"[3.5]--Life, death, love, I'm okay with those things",1182297600,"06 20, 2007",2007,3248,"['something', 'going', 'here', 'were', 'say', 'knew', 'what', 'everything', 'Fountain', 'supposed', 'mean', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'liar', 'said', 'feel', 'got', 'general', 'idea', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'compared', 'film', 'esoteric', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'appeal', 'something', 'Kubrick', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'think', 'wrong', 'claim', 'make', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'Fountain', 'story', 'too', 'desperately', 'being', 'explained', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'amazing', 'actress', 'half', 'lines', 'movie', 'feel', 'just', 'spoon-feeding', 'important', 'information', 'took', 'joy', 'away', 'movie', 'should', 'mostly', 'communicate', 'emotional', 'level', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'why', 'Fountain', 'ability', 'provoke', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'do', 'much', 'else.The', 'plot', 'three', 'parts', 'first', 'chronicling', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', '16th', 'century', 'conquistador', 'Tomas', 'journey', 'heart', 'Mayan', 'empire', 'locate', 'mythical', 'Tree', 'Life', 'reward', 'Queen', 'Isabella', 'eternal', 'life', 'so', 'escape', 'dying', 'Spain', 'second', 'set', '21st', 'century', 'Tommy', 'scientist', 'trying', 'cure', 'wife', 'cancer', 'help', 'strange', 'South', 'American', 'tree', 'stumbling', 'potential', 'cure', 'ageing', 'Ageing', 'not', 'death', 'third', 'plot', 'futuristic', 'Tom', 'escorting', 'dying', 'Tree', 'Life', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Tree', 'could', 'die', 'heart', 'dying', 'nebula', 'where', 'tree', 'plans', 'be', 'reborn', 'relationship', 'plots', 'blurred', 'certainly', 'open', 'interpretation', 'however', 'certain', 'constants', 'act', 'were', 'Not', 'counting', 'obvious', 'themes', 'life', 'death', 'love', 'are', 'repeated', 'elements', 'tragedy', 'noticeable', 'splashes', 'shared', 'dialogue', 'imagery', 'color', 'especially', 'gold', 'different', 'time', 'period', 'romance', 'Tommy', 'Izzy', 'particularly', '21st', 'century', 'time', 'period', 'heart-breaking', 'portrayal', 'love', 'loss.If', 'were', 'remove', 'entire', 'concept', 'past', 'future', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'story', 'man', 'love', 'so', 'intense', 'woman', 'lost', 'would', 'never', 'ever', 'recover', 'do', 'get', 'other', 'more', 'wondrous', 'aspects', 'Fountain', 'more', 'memorable', 'unique', 'film', 'beautiful', 'sense', 'hope', 'very', 'one-sided', 'love', 'story', 'mainly', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'character', 'experiences', 'Aronosky', 'wife', 'lovely', 'Weisz', 'play', 'character', 'never', 'fully', 'realized', 'degraded', 'object', 'affection', 'goal', 'main', 'character', 'someone', 'who', 'down', 'important', 'information', 'get', 'plot', 'rolling.The', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'heavy', 'film', 'were', 'message', 'visual', 'experience', ""n't"", 'clear', 'cut', 'adventure', 'film', 'one', 'viewers', 'think', 'found', 'out', 'Brad', 'Cate', 'was', 'suppose', 'star', 'film', 'apparently', 'went', 'do', 'equally', 'over-ambitious', 'infinitely', 'superior', 'Babel', 'Based', 'Biblical', 'Tree', 'Life', 'described', 'Genesis', 'think', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'pieces', 'artistry', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'sometime', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'clever', 'deep']",N/A

648021,A1KRNQWUNCTJS3,B00005JPAR,joebobhenrybob,"[2, 4]","First - the film is opulent, beautiful, masterful on a visual basis.  Worth watching if you appreciate beauty and good cinematography.  5+ stars on that basis.However 2 overall.  When Hugh says ""I'm going to die"" jubilantly, it resonates emotionally on the level of Jarjar Binks going ""weez-a-goin home!""I love the part about the Spanish conquistador, determined to win through to the fountain of youth, determined to NEVER die.  The implications of immortality - or even long life - are extremely intriguing.  We get old just as we're getting the hang of things.  Just as we are starting to gain wisdom, our minds start going senile and our bodies lose the power of action... how amazing would it be to have the body of a 20-30 year old for 1,000 years, or even thousands of years?  All the different things you could do, places you could go, people you might know or love.  It's quite an interesting proposition....but they cop out.  As far as the purpose of this film goes, as far as what it is ABOUT, it fails.  One film I highly recommend would be Rozencranz and Guildenstern are DeadRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  At one point, Rozencranz talks about being dead in a coffin... you'd be trapped in a box wouldn't you?  Of course, you'd be dead but that's the point.  If I said straight to you, I'm going to put you in a box, would you rather be alive or dead, naturally you'd choose to be alive, because maybe someone will come along and let you out.  So Hugh is trapped in a bubble with the Tree of Life, trying to make it to some new, viable place where life can continue, realizes he can't make it, and is suddenly and inexplicably jubilant that he is going to die... but this is the point of the movie, right?They fail to get us there.  You can wax poetic of how death is good, necessary, whatever, but uh... okay, you first.  I'm not saying you can't get there, I'm just saying they jump to an embrace of death without showing us how they get there.  Naturally if I were trapped in a bubble with a tree for a long, long time, I might feel a LITTLE like dying.  But there's always the chance  of something else, isn't there.  Going new places, meeting new people and so on.  If you said I'm going to stuff you in a bubble with a tree, would you rather be alive or dead, I say definitely alive.  What was this guy doing for the thousands of years he got to live, what did he get out of it, why did he decide it was good to die?  We never see why in the film.  Obviously it's tiresome to be stuck in a bubble, but with immortality, time spent there is an insignificant fraction of your total lifespan - it would be like giving up on life because of that one time you spilled a glass of milk as a child.  An intolerable span of time to experience at the time, but it's ok now.  Are the writer and director still alive?  They didn't jubilantly end it all yet?  Then WTF is this movie about then, what did they actually believe and were trying to convey?One more recommendationMelancholia...which more honestly and bravely tries to approach the idea of mortality.  Also beautifully done.On the other hand, if you want a movie about immortality, you could do worse than the original HighlanderHighlander...the immortal main character is world-weary, funny, deadpan, and still basically good after all his losses over the centuries.  And still has the will to live.  I find myself liking this film and its main character infinitely more than The Fountain despite any flaws....And yes, The Fountain is structured a little bit like Slaughterhouse 5, but I think you'd have to be kind of dumb not to be able to follow what's going on with the different timeline, what the film is really about, etc.  As far as what was going on in the film and why, I never had any unpleasant moments, but as far as the overall purpose the film is supposed to be working towards... not great as far as I'm concerned.",2,"Opulent, beautiful cop-out",1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,3907,"['First', 'film', 'opulent', 'beautiful', 'masterful', 'visual', 'basis', 'watching', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'good', 'cinematography', '5+', 'stars', 'basis.However', '2', 'overall', 'When', 'Hugh', ""'m"", 'going', 'die', 'jubilantly', 'emotionally', 'level', 'Jarjar', 'Binks', 'going', 'weez-a-goin', 'home', 'love', 'part', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'determined', 'win', 'fountain', 'youth', 'determined', 'NEVER', 'die', 'implications', 'immortality', 'even', 'long', 'life', 'are', 'extremely', 'intriguing', 'get', 'old', 'just', ""'re"", 'getting', 'hang', 'things', 'Just', 'are', 'starting', 'gain', 'wisdom', 'minds', 'start', 'going', 'senile', 'bodies', 'lose', 'power', 'action', 'how', 'amazing', 'would', 'be', 'have', 'body', '20-30', 'year', 'old', '1,000', 'years', 'even', 'thousands', 'years', 'different', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'places', 'could', 'go', 'people', 'might', 'know', 'love', 'quite', 'interesting', 'proposition', '.but', 'cop', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'purpose', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'what', 'ABOUT', 'One', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'would', 'be', 'Rozencranz', 'Guildenstern', 'are', 'DeadRosencrantz', 'Guildenstern', 'Are', 'Dead', 'one', 'point', 'Rozencranz', 'being', 'dead', 'coffin', ""'d"", 'be', 'trapped', 'box', 'would', ""n't"", 'course', ""'d"", 'be', 'dead', 'point', 'said', 'straight', ""'m"", 'going', 'put', 'box', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'alive', 'dead', 'naturally', ""'d"", 'choose', 'be', 'alive', 'maybe', 'someone', 'will', 'come', 'along', 'let', 'out', 'So', 'Hugh', 'trapped', 'bubble', 'Tree', 'Life', 'trying', 'make', 'new', 'viable', 'place', 'where', 'life', 'can', 'continue', 'realizes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'jubilant', 'going', 'die', 'point', 'movie', 'right', 'fail', 'get', 'there', 'can', 'wax', 'poetic', 'how', 'death', 'good', 'necessary', 'whatever', 'uh', 'okay', 'first', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'there', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'jump', 'embrace', 'death', 'showing', 'how', 'get', 'there', 'Naturally', 'were', 'trapped', 'bubble', 'tree', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'might', 'feel', 'LITTLE', 'dying', 'always', 'chance', 'something', 'else', ""n't"", 'there', 'Going', 'new', 'places', 'meeting', 'new', 'people', 'so', 'said', ""'m"", 'going', 'stuff', 'bubble', 'tree', 'would', 'rather', 'be', 'alive', 'dead', 'say', 'definitely', 'alive', 'What', 'was', 'guy', 'doing', 'thousands', 'years', 'got', 'live', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'why', 'did', 'decide', 'was', 'good', 'die', 'never', 'see', 'why', 'film', 'tiresome', 'be', 'stuck', 'bubble', 'immortality', 'time', 'spent', 'insignificant', 'fraction', 'total', 'lifespan', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'up', 'life', 'one', 'time', 'spilled', 'glass', 'milk', 'child', 'intolerable', 'span', 'time', 'experience', 'time', 'ok', 'now', 'Are', 'writer', 'director', 'still', 'alive', 'did', ""n't"", 'jubilantly', 'end', 'yet', 'Then', 'WTF', 'movie', 'then', 'what', 'did', 'actually', 'believe', 'were', 'trying', 'convey', 'One', 'more', 'recommendationMelancholia', 'more', 'honestly', 'bravely', 'tries', 'approach', 'idea', 'mortality', 'Also', 'beautifully', 'done.On', 'other', 'hand', 'want', 'movie', 'immortality', 'could', 'do', 'worse', 'original', 'HighlanderHighlander', 'immortal', 'main', 'character', 'world-weary', 'funny', 'deadpan', 'still', 'basically', 'good', 'losses', 'centuries', 'still', 'will', 'live', 'find', 'liking', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'infinitely', 'more', 'Fountain', 'flaws', '.And', 'yes', 'Fountain', 'structured', 'little', 'bit', 'Slaughterhouse', '5', 'think', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'kind', 'dumb', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'what', 'going', 'different', 'timeline', 'what', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'etc', 'As', 'far', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'why', 'never', 'had', 'unpleasant', 'moments', 'as', 'far', 'overall', 'purpose', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'working', 'towards', 'not', 'great', 'as', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned']",N/A

Rachel Weiz as a queen, a woman dying of cancer. He must rush to save her from cancer as it tears away the fabrics of their relationship and he devolves himself into finding the cure. shows that love can last in every generation.When I walked out of the movie, I had feelings of weirdness simmering all over my body after I watched a remarkable film. The film was simple yet made complex with the imagery and the hidden meanings. The meanings don't damper the film, it makes the film all that better, it makes the audience think, about what they just saw. Movies these days don't make you think. They apply the same motions to you and they expect you to clap and cheer for that movie, but no, this movie in itself is not like that. It leaves the audience, with a sense of confusion when they leave because the film bombards you with breathtaking things and multiple meaning imagery. The director wants you to figure out what was going on, and how you would interpret it because this film doesn't have just one meaning applied to the same situation over and over again. It has multiple meanings that are constantly changed based on your viewing experience. The meanings vary from person to person.The acting in the film was not all the best. Hugh Jackman delivers the most avant garde performance of the film, going all out and showing more range than he has as Wolverine or any other film roles. He takes his role seriously and he earns my respect as a dramatic actor because he certianly has proved that he can be a damn good one. Ellen Burystn, of Requiem For A Dream fame, is really underused in the picture. She really doesn't provide anything new to the movie and didn't really spark my interest in the performance. Rachel Weiez, the wife of Aronofsky, was good for what her role provided her. She took the role and tried to make it her own, and she looked beautiful in the process.The directing aspect of the film was top notch. Using the bacteria patterns for the 2026 scenes or whatever future year was perfect and spell binding to me. Also, I noticed that he used natural light opposed to artifical, I liked it, it gave the movie a more gritter feel to me in the past and future sequences. Also, There were some excellent shots, for example, Hugh Jackman walking towards The Tree of Life, and the whole futuristic sequences were outstanding. Although Aronofsky has been known for making really long films, the films length, over a hour and 30 minutes, was perfect for it as the imagery didn't get tiring and stale. He hit you with enough of it to stick in your head.When you make a film that can possibly have a audience love or hate it, and it sticks in your head and you discuss it and have conversations about the hidden meanings in the film, then it is a fine film for what goes through your thought process and the film maker's job is done when it leaves you with that feeling. I have a weird feeling that I am going to thinking about this movie for days to come.",4,"""Death is a diease.

648034,A1U74I9FWDMGEW,B00005JPAR,Joshua,"[3, 4]","As evident from the reviews that run the gamut from completely trashing it to loudly singing its praises, The Fountain is not a movie that everyone will like.  The story is heavily emotional, non-linear, and told from three separate viewpoints, each in it's own time-frame (spanning one thousand years) woven together in one cohesive whole.  Some will feel lost by the style of the movie due to these factors.  Others have remarked that the film comes off as pretentious, but I completely disagree.  Jackman and Weis both performed at the top of their game, and really owned their respective roles.  Yes, the film takes itself seriously, but not so much that it is off-putting.Visually, The Fountain is everything that a movie should be.  Most of the key special effects were created using macro photography, creating a timeless essence to special effects that continues to stun me every time I re-watch.  The fluid motions captured create an entire new world in space that should succeed in standing the test of time.The special features provide an interesting look into the movie's background and the process of making the script come to life.  My favorites here are a featurette giving a behind-the-scenes look into how use of miniatures, green screens, macro-photography, and other layered effects were used to generate some of the most stunning scenes in the movie, and a montage of of original macro-photography.  The lack of commentary on the disk is fairly disappointing (Aronofsky did record an mp3 commentary track that is available online), and I think that the film as a whole could benefit from additional special features.  I hope that Mr. Aronofsky succeeds in getting a special edition put out with even more juicy additional features.In  summary I find The Fountain to be memorable in a number of dimensions and highly re-watchable.  Each time I re-watch I savor the subtleties of the directing and scripting as well as the intricacy of the three interwoven plot-lines.  This is an extremely underrated movie that I think more people should see.  Aronofsky has demonstrated that he has really come into his own.  I was a fan of both Pi and Requiem, however I see both of those films as being a bit rough around the edges.  This film makes me optimistic that we will continue to see great things out of Aronofsky, and confident in my belief that he will be remembered as one of the greats.  I give this blu-ray five stars because as a film it is in a class all its own.

648035,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00005JPAR,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","Darren Aronofsky is a very talented writer & director. His previous two films ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" rank as top favorites for many cinephiles and are even more impressive when you realize how low-budget they are. Yet those films contain many haunting images and some innovative camera work. Give Aronofsky a budget and some big-name actors, you get ""The Fountain."" This film has haunting images, a haunting score, good performances, and is one of the most beautiful films I've seen. Too bad, it lacks that brilliance in plot. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as two lovers over the course of 2000+ years. First Jackman is a conquistador of Spain who is sent by the Queen (Weisz) to find the tree of life. Then, in the year 2000, Jackman is an animal surgeon whose wife Izzi (Weisz) is dying of cancer. He has samples of the tree of life and he's used them on monkeys to great success, but it may be to late to test it on his wife. Then there's the final segment, the one that transcends explanation. The only thing I can tell you about it is that Jackman is bald and Weisz is a tree. Plot-wise, this is Aronofsky's weakest film...Visually, it's his strongest. Even with a modest budget he was able to produce fantastic visuals (the visuals are one of the reasons few people forget ""Requiem for a Dream"" when they see it), but here he outdoes himself. I'm about to start ranting, so prepare yourselves. Aronofsky had an actual budget now, which gave him a certain level of artistic freedom. This film is absolutely, unequivally visually arresting. It's a film that is incredibly beautiful to look at, even if you're not entirely sure what it is that you're looking at. The final scenes will keep your eyes glued to the screen, whether you've enjoyed the rest of the movie or not. The performances are good, Jackman gives an under-praised performance here. He puts a chameleon act on the film and manages to brilliant disappear behind each version of the character he's playing. Weisz looks stunning, but her character(s) are one-dimensional and thefroe hard to really feel for. ""The Fountain"" has had a mixed reception from critics, but on a purely visual level it deserves 5 stars. Since I actually paid attention the weak plot and one-dimensional Weisz character, it gets less. However, if you open your mind and just let the images take over than you'll find a very haunting experience awaits you. The film co-stars Ellen Burstyn ('Requiem for a Dream') and Ethan Suplee ('My Name is Earl').GRADE: B",4,Visually Stunning.,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,2522,"['Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'very', 'talented', 'writer', 'director', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'rank', 'top', 'favorites', 'many', 'cinephiles', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'impressive', 'when', 'realize', 'how', 'low-budget', 'are', 'films', 'contain', 'many', 'haunting', 'images', 'innovative', 'camera', 'work', 'Give', 'Aronofsky', 'budget', 'big-name', 'actors', 'get', 'Fountain', 'film', 'haunting', 'images', 'haunting', 'score', 'good', 'performances', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Too', 'bad', 'brilliance', 'plot', 'film', 'stars', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'two', 'lovers', 'course', '2000+', 'years', 'First', 'Jackman', 'conquistador', 'Spain', 'who', 'sent', 'Queen', 'Weisz', 'find', 'tree', 'life', 'Then', 'year', '2000', 'Jackman', 'animal', 'surgeon', 'wife', 'Izzi', 'Weisz', 'dying', 'cancer', 'samples', 'tree', 'life', 'used', 'monkeys', 'great', 'success', 'may', 'be', 'late', 'test', 'wife', 'Then', 'final', 'segment', 'one', 'explanation', 'only', 'thing', 'can', 'tell', 'Jackman', 'bald', 'Weisz', 'tree', 'Plot-wise', 'Aronofsky', 'weakest', 'film', 'Visually', 'strongest', 'Even', 'modest', 'budget', 'was', 'able', 'produce', 'fantastic', 'visuals', 'visuals', 'are', 'one', 'reasons', 'few', 'people', 'forget', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'when', 'see', 'here', ""'m"", 'start', 'ranting', 'so', 'prepare', 'yourselves', 'Aronofsky', 'had', 'actual', 'budget', 'now', 'gave', 'certain', 'level', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'film', 'absolutely', 'unequivally', 'visually', 'arresting', 'film', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'look', 'even', ""'re"", 'not', 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'keep', 'eyes', 'glued', 'screen', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'Jackman', 'under-praised', 'performance', 'here', 'chameleon', 'act', 'film', 'manages', 'brilliant', 'disappear', 'version', 'character', 'playing', 'Weisz', 'stunning', 'character', 's', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'thefroe', 'hard', 'really', 'feel', 'Fountain', 'had', 'mixed', 'reception', 'critics', 'purely', 'visual', 'level', '5', 'stars', 'actually', 'paid', 'attention', 'weak', 'plot', 'one-dimensional', 'Weisz', 'character', 'less', 'However', 'open', 'mind', 'just', 'let', 'images', 'take', 'over', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'haunting', 'experience', 'awaits', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Dream', 'Ethan', 'Suplee', 'Name', 'Earl', '.GRADE', 'B']",N/A

It's actually daring, especially in such a monumental, epic scale. It's also reason to tremble, as such ventures can easily lead to masterpieces, or their opposite, legendary bombs.Despite being booed at Cannes, and its somewhat mixed, chilly reception by critics, ""The Fountain"" is a very interesting film, not because of its ideas, or because it contains very profound revelations. Though seemingly complicated, the film has a (daring?) simplicity to it, and anyone familiar with modern spiritual movements will get it right away.It is true that more earthly or intellectual types might actually find it unbearable. But such a film has a right to exist, especially since the  issues it addresses and the questions it poses are so rarely taken on in such a nakedly vulnerable fashion. Yet, be warned, that this is more Paulo Coello or Miguel Ruiz than Krzysztof Kieslowski or the other Ruiz, Raoul.  And, so what?This heartfelt conviction in its universal subjects such as love and reincarnation powers ""The Fountain"", which is as brutally beautiful a film as you will ever see.The love story, which spans the ages, is full of astonishing, memorable images. However, it's this same love story which probably prevents the film from being a great one, simply because it's not really fleshed out, and it gives the story something of a cerebral (others will probably say mindless), conceptual, feeling.Just something, as the film is greatly helped by intense performances by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz as the literally star-crossed lovers at the center of the story.Love it or hate it...

648053,A3SMYPQ8KXWNXU,B00005JPAR,kerrjac,"[6, 7]","I enjoy watching movies that stretch my imagination, and bring me in and pose large questions. However, I often find that art movies go out of their way to make things too complicated. The focus is too often on the plot - it might have a bazillion jumbled pieces, which actually fit together (say, Momento), or which don't even come together (say, anything by David Lynch), or which are made to represent something I don't understand (say, The Last Temptation). But if I were looking for mere symbolism or complexity of thought I'd read an essay about mechanics or something. The truth of the matter is that artistic cinema has a more to offer than mere complexity or intellectual wackery.The premise for The Fountain is deceptively simple: A cancer researcher's wife is dying of cancer; in the meanwhile, she is writing a historical / mythical book about Spain's conquest of the Mayans. The movie progresses by interweaving her book and his experiences - threads of reality, history, and myth - none of which, again, are very complicated.Written above, it all looks somewhat bare perhaps a bit cheesy. But movies aren't meant to be read, they're meant to be watched. And this one unfolds very graciously. It quite literally ebbs and flows, thanks to the accomplished cinematography, editing, and score. The style has a way of digging its way inside your head: A shot of a smiling woman spontaneously running around a house feels like a personal revelation and a past regret about life slipping away; a shot of a warrior being boldly carried off by the enemies seems like a body attacking a bacteria. The movie can even be seen as a story of movement, with some story arches literally going up, others going down. A passing shot into an intriguing piece of wallpaper feels like an inevitable approach.Most movies use such stylistic techniques for the sake of character development, or to move along the plot. However, in The Fountain, these elements are in fact the movie. Like the directors other great movies, this one capitalizes on these elements in order to portray a progression of events and feelings in a manner that only cinema can. While such attention to style can often be devastating for a story, The Fountain uses it in good taste: And why not use the tools of cinema, in congruence with the way in which humans watch and register things? Ignoring such tools would be like writing an essay without any periods.Consequently, some people might ask, ""What's the message this guy's trying to get across?"" and ""Who are these characters?"" But these questions miss point, (and any movie that could answer such questions, I'd argue, is a bad movie, because it might as well be a book); The Fountain feels more like a symphony - you wouldn't ask those questions to Beethoven about his Fifth, would you? Of course, much of the movie's impact will depend on its aesthetic effect on you: It's difficult to explain why you like a piece of music, it just feels right. But if you surrender yourself to this one's feelings - its progression, texture, and flow - you might get totally sucked in. And at the center there isn't an idea, a message, or an unforgettable character; there's a feeling: Awe. The feeling is wrapped in timeless questions about the pursuit of science, man's mortality, the differences between man and woman, and the reality of myth; it's wrapped in the steps that one needs to take to experience it. But at the same time it's not too removed or abstract; it registers as brutal and thought-provoking, and so very *human*.",5,graceful,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,3542,"['enjoy', 'watching', 'movies', 'stretch', 'imagination', 'bring', 'pose', 'large', 'questions', 'However', 'often', 'find', 'art', 'movies', 'go', 'way', 'make', 'things', 'too', 'complicated', 'focus', 'too', 'often', 'plot', 'might', 'have', 'bazillion', 'jumbled', 'pieces', 'actually', 'fit', 'together', 'say', 'Momento', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'together', 'say', 'anything', 'David', 'Lynch', 'are', 'made', 'represent', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'say', 'Last', 'Temptation', 'were', 'looking', 'mere', 'symbolism', 'complexity', 'thought', ""'d"", 'read', 'essay', 'mechanics', 'something', 'truth', 'matter', 'artistic', 'cinema', 'more', 'offer', 'mere', 'complexity', 'intellectual', 'wackery.The', 'premise', 'Fountain', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'cancer', 'researcher', 'wife', 'dying', 'cancer', 'meanwhile', 'writing', 'historical', '/', 'mythical', 'book', 'Spain', 'conquest', 'Mayans', 'movie', 'interweaving', 'book', 'experiences', 'threads', 'reality', 'history', 'myth', 'none', 'again', 'are', 'very', 'complicated.Written', 'somewhat', 'bare', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'movies', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'read', ""'re"", 'meant', 'be', 'watched', 'one', 'very', 'graciously', 'quite', 'literally', 'ebbs', 'thanks', 'accomplished', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'score', 'style', 'way', 'digging', 'way', 'head', 'shot', 'smiling', 'woman', 'spontaneously', 'running', 'around', 'house', 'personal', 'revelation', 'past', 'regret', 'life', 'slipping', 'away', 'shot', 'warrior', 'being', 'boldly', 'carried', 'off', 'enemies', 'body', 'attacking', 'bacteria', 'movie', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'seen', 'story', 'movement', 'story', 'arches', 'literally', 'going', 'up', 'others', 'going', 'down', 'passing', 'shot', 'intriguing', 'piece', 'wallpaper', 'feels', 'inevitable', 'approach.Most', 'movies', 'use', 'such', 'stylistic', 'techniques', 'sake', 'character', 'development', 'move', 'plot', 'However', 'Fountain', 'elements', 'are', 'fact', 'movie', 'directors', 'other', 'great', 'movies', 'one', 'capitalizes', 'elements', 'order', 'portray', 'progression', 'events', 'feelings', 'manner', 'only', 'cinema', 'can', 'such', 'attention', 'style', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'devastating', 'story', 'Fountain', 'good', 'taste', 'why', 'not', 'use', 'tools', 'cinema', 'congruence', 'way', 'humans', 'watch', 'register', 'things', 'Ignoring', 'such', 'tools', 'would', 'be', 'writing', 'essay', 'periods.Consequently', 'people', 'might', 'ask', 'What', 'message', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'Who', 'are', 'characters', 'questions', 'miss', 'point', 'movie', 'could', 'answer', 'such', 'questions', ""'d"", 'argue', 'bad', 'movie', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'book', 'Fountain', 'feels', 'more', 'symphony', 'would', ""n't"", 'ask', 'questions', 'Beethoven', 'Fifth', 'would', 'course', 'much', 'movie', 'impact', 'will', 'depend', 'aesthetic', 'effect', 'difficult', 'explain', 'why', 'piece', 'music', 'just', 'feels', 'right', 'surrender', 'one', 'feelings', 'progression', 'texture', 'flow', 'might', 'get', 'totally', 'sucked', 'center', ""n't"", 'idea', 'message', 'unforgettable', 'character', 'feeling', 'Awe', 'feeling', 'wrapped', 'timeless', 'questions', 'pursuit', 'science', 'man', 'mortality', 'differences', 'man', 'woman', 'reality', 'myth', 'wrapped', 'steps', 'one', 'take', 'experience', 'same', 'time', 'not', 'too', 'removed', 'abstract', 'brutal', 'thought-provoking', 'so', 'very', '*human*']",N/A

Swanson,"[5, 6]","4.444 starsI'm not certain The Fountain is a great film, but beyond question it is a true work of art.Watching this shimmering movie was mesmerizing, pleasantly confusing, thought-provoking on many levels, and perhaps too void of narrative push for some (see the many one-star reviews here, some of which make strong cases; for those who need plot movement, this is a slog). I for one loved the experience; it took my mind to places very very few movies have or can, and that in itself makes it a must for those who love to watch their own mind at work, as well as that of an increasingly masterful filmmaker.Clearly Aronofsky is in both categories, and what a mind his is to watch. His grasp of symmetry, both visually and conceptually, peaks in this film. Pi is farther out but The Fountain is deeper, the work of a much more emotionally mature man than Pi or Requiem, and miles afield from his recent breakthrough The Wrestler. I'm betting this guy has a film or two in him that will stun the world into submission, at which point his oeuvre will be reexamined and gasps of awe will issue forth over this little gem.Orrr, maybe not. It is indeed amazing that this was followed by The Wrestler, as two more disparate films are hard to imagine. I for one think this is a much finer film; maybe if Mickey Rourke had made his comeback in The Fountain it would be the one with all the acclaim.In any case, this is a truly unique and gorgeous movie, with many shots of breathtaking beauty and classical symmetry. DA sure can frame a scene, and I didn't notice the camera itself once during the flick, a rare event, expecially for a movie as concerned with cinematic perfection as this. The plot lines, such as they are, are also driving towards the cores of human existence: dealing with death, wishing for ever more time with those we love, and luxuriating in the moment before it and we are whisked away into the void.Speaking of which, there is a perfectly luscious visual moment with the tree of life and the stars and Jackman (who gives a very strong performance, as usual) during which the missus and I were sitting on the sofa, engrossed in the spectacle (this movie makes blu-ray and a nice big flat screen make perfect sense), when our dog suddenly started having a dream on the floor behind us. You know how they quiver and yip and move their paws like they're chasing God's own squirrel through the celestial meadows in Dog Heaven? I love the sound she makes when she's dreaming, and as I sat beside my human sweetie, holding her hand, eyes on the sumptuous montage of realities onscreen depicting and ears on our pooch off in her own little dream world--a place I often wonder about but will never see in this lifetime--I realized very clearly that I was in the midst of my own perfect little synchronistic moment in space and time and soaked in it with a smile, feeling the love and ease as deeply as I could and knowing that one day this moment will be like manna that I can enjoy at will.Any movie that can help raise one's consciousness of self-awareness like that while simultaneously creating a field of knowledge which demands your surrender (plot junkies take note) must perforce be something special. Thanks and praises to Darren Aronofsky for even trying to make movies devoid of profit motive, let alone getting them made with this much love and precision. If Leonardo Da Vinci and Terence McKenna ever meet upstairs, The Fountain will be playing at the local art house rep theatre, on a huge screen lush with golds and greens, surrounded in all directions by inky blackness. I hope I can be their usher.PS As an added bonus, this movie points out that living forever might not be the cup of tea one likes to imagine.Embrace the entropy; it's beautiful too...perhaps even perfect.And besides, maybe this is all just a dream our dog is having.",4,"For fans of art and film, a revelation.

I'll start off with the easiest thing to review.  The effects.  I was blown away by the shots of Thomas in the bubble with all the golden fragments falling down from the sky, that was great CG.  Actually it was done by photographing different stuf under a microscope(Don't expect me to be Mr. In depth:)The direction was either great OR not so great, like I said earlier I'm leaning towards great.  Hugh Jackman is very good in his 3 roles as is Rachel Weisz, I did like Hugh better in The Prestige, but thats just me.  This is a kind of movie you have to see more than once to fully appreciate it.  I know that this movie divides audiences.  The person I went with loathed it.Overall if you like to have everything explained to you and to not have any loose ends by the time the credits roll I suggest you go out, rent a Tom Cruise movie, and enjoy.

648074,A2MG8DHACXH5MS,B00005JPAR,"Lola Jovita ""Literary Fan""","[1, 2]","Quite a telling image with Hugh Jackman resembling a cross between Timothy Leary and Buddha in the scenes of him as a 26th century explorer. The Fountain is Sci Fi meets epic romance and I'm really glad Hugh Jackman was in this role rather than the original actor cast for the part - Brad Pitt. Jackman is Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in 1500, 2000, and 2500 in a relentless search for a cure to save his love Isabella, Isabelle, Issy. The trio of characters all play into one another but are still distinct. Jackman is an international film star in his own right but his more private relationship with the papparazzi allows his thespian gifts to shine in a more opaque light. Jackman melts into the different personalities that are weaved together in The Fountain. We see his role not his celebrity life clouding a stellar performance. Being a trained actor skilled in singing and dancing makes Jackman a belivable cast of Tomas, Tommy, and Tom in a psychedelic twist of karma and fate across the centuries. He melts into the role with his muse Isabelle/Issy/Isabella whom he spends centuries trying to save. The timing of this film released at the height of Brangelina is poignat because had Brad Pitt stayed in the lead it may have been unbelievable to audiences of the character's mad devotion to stay with his wife. This is what makes the film work.Jackman emotes well and plays a Spanish conquistador, American medical doctor, and space age explorer all in one without seeming like the same character each time. Cris crossing between three different lifetimes over a millenium to save the woman he loves The Fountain plays on karma, reincarnation, and endless love and its quest to conquer death. The ending is odd because you don't know whether he succeeds or not and it heartbreaking since it isn't clear if the lovers unite. A well done film that blends distinct story lines into a captivating tale that concludes in a unique way. I'm impressed albeit confused. All that said, mark my words, one day movie trailers will promote Academy Award Winner Hugh Jackman in films he stars in. It's evident in The Fountain that, pretty soon, fellow Australian Russell Crowe won't just be sharing the land down under with Jackman, but also an Oscar trophy.",5,Love Death Rebirth Life Love Death Rebirth Life Love,1189123200,"09 7, 2007",2007,2247,"['telling', 'image', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'resembling', 'cross', 'Timothy', 'Leary', 'Buddha', 'scenes', '26th', 'century', 'explorer', 'Fountain', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'epic', 'romance', ""'m"", 'really', 'glad', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'was', 'role', 'rather', 'original', 'actor', 'cast', 'part', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jackman', 'Tomas', 'Tommy', 'Tom', '1500', '2000', '2500', 'relentless', 'search', 'cure', 'save', 'love', 'Isabella', 'Isabelle', 'Issy', 'trio', 'characters', 'play', 'one', 'are', 'still', 'distinct', 'Jackman', 'international', 'film', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'more', 'private', 'relationship', 'papparazzi', 'thespian', 'gifts', 'shine', 'more', 'opaque', 'light', 'Jackman', 'different', 'personalities', 'are', 'weaved', 'together', 'Fountain', 'see', 'role', 'not', 'celebrity', 'life', 'clouding', 'stellar', 'performance', 'Being', 'trained', 'actor', 'skilled', 'singing', 'dancing', 'Jackman', 'belivable', 'cast', 'Tomas', 'Tommy', 'Tom', 'psychedelic', 'twist', 'karma', 'fate', 'centuries', 'role', 'muse', 'Isabelle/Issy/Isabella', 'whom', 'centuries', 'trying', 'save', 'timing', 'film', 'released', 'height', 'Brangelina', 'poignat', 'had', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'stayed', 'lead', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unbelievable', 'audiences', 'character', 'mad', 'devotion', 'stay', 'wife', 'film', 'work.Jackman', 'well', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'American', 'medical', 'doctor', 'space', 'age', 'explorer', 'one', 'seeming', 'same', 'character', 'time', 'Cris', 'crossing', 'three', 'different', 'lifetimes', 'millenium', 'save', 'woman', 'Fountain', 'plays', 'karma', 'reincarnation', 'endless', 'love', 'quest', 'conquer', 'death', 'ending', 'odd', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'not', 'heartbreaking', ""n't"", 'clear', 'lovers', 'unite', 'well', 'done', 'film', 'distinct', 'story', 'lines', 'captivating', 'tale', 'unique', 'way', ""'m"", 'impressed', 'albeit', 'confused', 'said', 'mark', 'words', 'one', 'day', 'movie', 'trailers', 'will', 'promote', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winner', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'films', 'evident', 'Fountain', 'pretty', 'soon', 'fellow', 'Australian', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'just', 'be', 'sharing', 'land', 'down', 'Jackman', 'also', 'Oscar', 'trophy']",N/A

The Fountain has it all: love, despair, war, peace, culture (both spiritual and religious), re-birth, death, present reality, time capsule science fiction&#8230;  To truly appreciate this movie you must understand that there are three states of &#8220;being&#8221;: Jackman as a brain surgeon/ scientist looking to cure cancer since his wife Weisz is dying; Jackman as a Conquistador pledging to find the Tree of Life and save the Queen (Weisz) and Spain from the inquisition; and Jackman projected in the future in a space cap traveling through the galaxy with the Tree of Life (Weisz IMO).I will leave the finer details of how all three tie together for when you view the movie yourself. But, you can interpret all three states as a reflection of the past, present and future, or as a reflection of Jackman and Weisz&#8217;s undying love and bond, or even as the distant places we take our own minds when unsatisfied by our present circumstances.The filmography is absolutely beautiful, even though it is filmed quite darker than your average movie. The cast is exquisite and truly bring out the best in each character. The plot although confusing the first time you watch it without having a heads up of the three states, later becomes like Jackman&#8217;s obsession. If you enjoyed the movie, you find yourself going over everything and thinking of new ways to look at the three phases, examining what they mean to the characters and to you and perhaps a different part of you.

It isn't that I don't understand existential expression and works of art that are ripped from the soul of an artist.As far as the ""meaning"" of this film goes - coming to peace with the statement ""I am going to die"": In my experience Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" is a far more cohesive work resulting in a far more meaningful experience. And Bergman beautifully brought us to this truth through the use of light rather than a battery of super-cooled graphics work stations.I just found The Fountain very boring and pretentious whereas The Seventh Seal kept me captivated from start to finish.  The visuals in The Fountain would have been great had they not been used to such excess.This film was a jumbled mess...

True, it's very complicated to understand, and you need to have to your smart brain switched on. Since I don't have one of those, I just watched it and really enjoyed the love story unfolding before my eyes. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were absolutely amazing characters, and I have to say Rachel did a brilliant job, but more about that later.The reason why this film can come across as complicated, as it spans centuries! Get your head around this: in 16th century Europe, Hugh plays a Spanish explorer searching for Incan magic; in the present day he plays a doctor desperately searchng for a cure for his dying wife, and in the far off future, he plays a hairless (!) space traveller, seeking a way into the afterlife.Rachel's character appears in nearly all of the scenes with Hugh, in different periods of time. The present day character she plays, is dying, possibly from a brain tumour (?), and Rachel really manages to throw herself into it. An extremely brutal haircut/wig really helps her pull it off.Hugh is a bit of a strange character in this, particularly in the present day segments again, his wife his dying, yet he keeps throwing himself into his work, suffering deep inside. But then he reads her unfinished novel, called The Fountain. Only she tells him to complete it after she dies. In the future, he appears almost completely hairless, which really freaked me out to begin with. He really didn't suit being bald, whether it was a skull cap thing, or he did actually shave it all off.It's a very strange, but moving movie ultimately, and there's not much to say about it, except see it! You might not possibly understand it, I definitely needed the ending explained to me! But it does all work, just might need a second viewing. Oh, and don't watch it alone - I figured if I'd watched it alone, I probably would have cried from beginning to end! I was nearly crying at the chimps/apes.

The Fountain deserves to be placed among the greatest movies of all time, and it gets an unfair amount of hatred. Aranofsky's project could have been seen as what it was, a beautiful piece of art which accomplished everything that people who value artistic integrity which would happen instead of the business-as-usual of Hollywood. Instead, the movie was hated because many couldn't understand its ambition. Please, open your mind, and see this film.If you're a film buff, aspiring or accomplished, &#34;The Fountain&#34; must be put directly at the top of your &#34;must-see&#34; list. Absolutely every aspect of this movie is incredible. I'll give this a quick breakdown, but seriously- watch this film.Sound- Clint Mansell's score forms one of the greatest albums in modern history, and I'll pause to say I'm being completely serious about my level of enthusiasm. The music is so rich with emotion, that it could be used for guided meditation- and I have used it as such myself. You may want to go ahead and purchase the score separately- it will move you to tears.Imagery- The film's journey is largely accomplished by imagery that rides on Mansell's wonderful score. Often intentionally dreamlike, a wealth of computer-generated or computer-enhanced scenes transport you from the familiar and in to Aranofsky's world. The visuals, especially toward the climax, are something that could only be accomplished by modern filmmaking. Truly an epic journey.Acting- Hugh Jackman is among the best actors of this era, and he's in fine form here. Much of the movie develops from silent emoting and small actions which must carry great effect, a role which requires a master, and Jackman excels. Rachel Weisz plays a supporting role in every sense, the strength and beauty of her character being necessary for our hero's journey.Script- The movie is so gorgeous and accomplished- in audio, video, and kinetics- that it could otherwise be a silent film and still be every bit as amazing. The words which are spoken serve to make the central theme explicit, although there is no true narrative in the traditional sense. As Aranofsky has said, the action of the film is essentially a &#34;very simple love story,&#34; the larger journey of the film is what transports this basic story onto a higher plane.If you care about films, see The Fountain now.

No such luck, unfortunately.  I have no problem with the film's non-linearity of plot (I loved ""Reservoir Dogs"").  No, my problem lies with a film that pretends to be - but is not - a ""work of art"", and is instead a dull, lifeless series of vignettes that seem loosely related to each other, but which overall has such a lack of cosehiveness that it literally leaves you feeling cheated out of your time and effort.  I viewed it with my wife and teen-age kids, and at the end, our collecive reaction was - literally - ""That's IT...?"" (or, feel free to replace ""What the hell was THAT...?"").  Visually, the film has its moments, especially the ""bubble in space"" scenes.  But the whole ""tree of life"" thing is SO over-done, Jackman's pathetic crying scenes are so plentiful and overly long, and the bizarre ""Kung Fu/Kwai Chang Caine-like"" similarities (Jackman in a floating, zero-gravity lotus position looks embarrasingly like David Carradine -- I half expected Master Po to appear on the scene) are so ludicrous that one finds oneself wishing for a merciful end.  Eventually, that end does arrive, but it is so anticlimatic, and so ""lame"", for want of a better word, that it's literally as though the actors, director, and all concerned collectively had had enough, and decided to just STOP.

648109,AN8M401S8Y6DA,B00005JPAR,Mike Liddell,"[2, 3]","That is the message that came through to me in Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain which goes about as deep as your imagination wants to go.  Aronofsky is one of the most ambitious and creative of modern filmmakers and writers, and The Fountain is one ambitious and touching project.  Other creative and ambitious directors/writers that come to mind in the same class are Charlie Kaufman (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind) and the new Mexican wave of directors Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (Children of Men), Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu (Babel), and the great Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth).As I said this film could be analyzed and go as deep and as personal as you like, you can literally make this film your own.  For me it was about searching for time and what your missing while you search.  What better actor then to cast in such a role then Hugh Jackman who in 2006 appeared in 6 films including The Fountain, Happy Feet, Flushed Away, The Prestige, Scoop, and X-Men the Last Stand.  Jackman in that year brought himself to a new level, how busy must he have been, what was he missing out on while working so hard, maybe that is why he delivers such a real and touching performance.  Another perfectly cast role is Aronofsky's wife Oscar Winner Rachel Weisz in a story where she is someones wife and dying, she was powerful in this and I'm sure it hit home with such topics and only having to look over her shoulder to see the love of her life and imagine him in Jackman's role.  Jackman is unable to accept her dying, he is in a position to make a change being a scientist, he is so close and time is running out.  He misses the walk of the first snow with her due to working for a cure, he is not at her bedside when she needs him, so while he is busy trying to have more time with her he is losing the time he could be having.  Weisz's character is writing a book ""The Fountain"" where a conquistador goes on a mission to find the fountain of youth while in the process all of Spain's men are slain.  She leaves the last chapter for her husband to finish.This could apply to anyone who puts in too much overtime to provide for their family or is so into there career and getting more and more that there missing out on their kids childhood and that you can't get back.Another point as brought up as he died so we could live, in the process of trying to save his wife he makes an amazing discovery which could help many people, so because of her illness she inspires him to find a cure and if she dies her death could have saved countless others.  And you could keep going and analyzing this bold tale of life and death and choices.I gave this 4.5 stars as 10minutes before the end I found the film to lose itself for a time being, however I might have just been lost, I still found it to be a powerful and touching  film.  The theory of a person being buried and growing into a tree and death is life, and the sole lives on, like those messages this movie for me evolves and transcends beyond a film and into a message and a feeling.  Even if I forgot the film's specifics and the characters names over time, to think of the Film I would still remember the feeling it gave me and the message I took from it.",5,4.5 Stars.

648115,A7YYT3GKA8W29,B00005JPAR,"M. Johnson ""Boone""","[1, 3]","Film: The FountainAudience: me (46) and son (12)One more off my to-watch list. Note to past self: don't bother.Warning: &lt;spoilers>. But go ahead and read this anyway. I'm not really spoiling anything worthy of protection. Telling you that the secret entree of a mystery meal is in fact an inedible boiled chicken foot isn't really a spoiler.I love weird. I love beautiful. I love sci-fi. I love fascinating stories and compelling characters. Darren Aronofski's The Fountain had too little of each. It's two-and-a-half interwoven stories. In one, Spanish conquistadors search for the biblical Tree of Life a la Garden of Eden. In another, a biologist is on the cusp of a breakthrough that could change humanity and save the life of his dying girlfriend. In the -and-a-half, the biologist is taking his girlfriend-tree up to a dying star in a magic space bubble. I was encouraged to watch it primarily for the visuals, and to a lesser extent the sci-fi and the drama.The visual aspect:As stunning as the visuals are at first, they don't stay fresh for long. You've seen the poster of a guy and a tree in a bubble floating into a nebula. That made for quite an image for a few minutes, but they just keep cutting back to it without giving us a clue what's going on. And that whole segment is so awash in some of the worst cliche, new-age pamphlet images that started getting on my nerves almost immediately. Lots of images of a bald guy in kung-fu pajamas meditating in the lotus position among the stars and bathed in a cosmic/spiritual light...gag. This third of the movie looks like every hokey new-age pamphlet you've ever dropped in a garbage can ten steps after some stinky hippy shoved it in your hand.The sci-fi aspect:What if you could live forever? Who knows? They pretty much asked the question, then moved on without looking back. A biologist finds a tree who's sap heals all ailments and could give eternal life, and possibly save his girlfriend who's dying of a brain tumor, which brings us to the final point...The drama aspect:...the biologist's lab boss comes in and tells him the cure works, seconds after his girlfriend dies in his arms.There's porn, where it's just people ""doin' it"" on screen for the sole purpose of giving you sexual arousal  without any aesthetic value. Recently the very useful term was coined, ""torture porn"" which provides some with sadistic arousal. After watching Fountain, I'm moved to further extend the construction to ""tragedy porn"" in which you're given to watch people being sad in the same fashion. Sad, sad, sad...the end. She's sick, and he's all emotional, but she's strong and ""not afraid"" (she keeps hitting us over the head with this fact). Then she's dead, and we get to watch everyone be sad for what seems an eternity--what if you could be sad forever? In lieu of  a story, they real-quick run through the textbook K&uuml;bler-Ross stages of grief (denial, anger, bargaining, depression & acceptance). Watching this with my son, we had one of those great comic moments of spontaneous synchronicity where I started the sentence and he finished it with me, ""It would be really sad...if only we cared."" That's it. There's no reason to care about them. We spend the first thirty minutes trying to sort out what the heck is going on as the film is intentionally weird and confusing, and the characters are more ciphers than souls which makes it hard to emotionally relate to or invest in them.But I was a good viewer. I never fast-forwarded or skipped ahead. I had faith that there'd be some kind of payoff if I endured till the end. The payoff? A guy turns in to a bush. That's it. It was kinda cool, I guess. hardly worth two hours, though. Like the whole movie, pseudo-profound.It imitates depth, and for a teenager, it might actually pass as deep.

Its been a loooong time since there was a truly epic, meta-physical, thought-provoking film, the last one being 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Many positive reviews seem to try and compare this to 2001 and Im not quite sure what they are thinking.  This movie has almost NOTHING in common with 2001 and to compare this meandering, pointless drivel to that movie is an insult to Mr. Kubrick.This movie was basically just a love story littered with scene after scene of Hugh Jackman in a space bubble.  The special effects are OK but the same shots seem to be used over and over robbing them of impact.  Rachel Weisz plays a good character and you are impressed by her resolve and her attitide as she faces imminent death but is not afarid of it.  Jackman is OK in this role but he has one too many crying scenes that just dont seem to be naturally occurring or forced if you will. Overall, the love story itself was not bad and there were moments when you did feel for the characters and their tough situation.  However, this was badly ruined by the completely incoherent, muddled plot that jumped around like my kids on sugar.  Scene after pointless scene of old Spain, space bubble, kissing the wifes neck, etc, were inserted into the wrong place or wrong context and it really killed the flow of the movie for me.  The film felt like it was 3 hours long but was only a little over an hour and a half.  By the time it ended I really felt cheated and rather disappointed.Before all of the ""You didnt get it"" nimrods start spewing their hate, please realize that I got it all right but there really isnt anything to get. There is a VERY fine line between artsy movies being plodding and pointless or being incredible works of art. Well, this film is much closer to pointless than it is incredible art. The director was trying to make it clever without really thinking muich about why or how and ended up with what seeemd like an abstract film-student mess. This was NOT profound at all.  It was not mesmerizing. It was simply a fairly common ""been there, done that"" love story with some semi-cheesey sci-fi scenes thrown in to make you think you were watching some ""grand"" epic.Go ahead, watch it.

Originally conceived a few years back, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the feature roles, along with a much larger budget than the end result, The Fountain was put on indefinite hiatus thanks to nearly every party involved backing out.  Shortly there after, Aronofsky adapted his story into a graphic novel for DC Comics' mature readers imprint Vertigo, and soon enough, the film would be resurrected to be what we have now.  And be glad it was.  The Fountain is, for lack of a better word, a triumph of modern film making.  Hugh Jackman stars as Tom in this metaphysical love story spanning a thousand years.  Beginning as a Spanish conquistador, continuing as a present day desperate doctor, and finally as an interstellar traveler, Tom tries again and again to cheat death and ensure an eternity with his dearly beloved Izzi (Rachel Weisz), only to lose her time and again as well.  Aronofsky's theme and look at the inevitability of death is powerful to say the least.  It's no secret that Aronofsky doesn't present the film in the most accessable manner, nor is that his intention.  This is not a film that one can just walk into and know what to expect: The Fountain is a slow moving and heart wrenching journey that isn't easy to take, but for those that do, they will find something that is truly special indeed.  Jackman gives the absolute best performance of his career, and that, as well as the amazing special effects (mostly done without CGI!) are worth the price of admission alone.  Simply put, The Fountain is a masterpiece of modern film making; but be forewarned, this is not a film for all tastes and audiences.  If you do check it out and are not sure what to make of it, give it a second viewing, and above all, give it a chance.",5,A triumph,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1886,"['story', 'Pi', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'Fountain', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'film', 'Originally', 'conceived', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Cate', 'Blanchett', 'feature', 'much', 'larger', 'budget', 'end', 'result', 'Fountain', 'was', 'put', 'indefinite', 'hiatus', 'thanks', 'nearly', 'party', 'involved', 'backing', 'out', 'Shortly', 'Aronofsky', 'adapted', 'story', 'graphic', 'novel', 'DC', 'Comics', 'mature', 'readers', 'imprint', 'Vertigo', 'soon', 'enough', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'resurrected', 'be', 'what', 'have', 'now', 'be', 'glad', 'was', 'Fountain', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'triumph', 'modern', 'film', 'making', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'Tom', 'metaphysical', 'love', 'story', 'spanning', 'thousand', 'years', 'Beginning', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'continuing', 'present', 'day', 'desperate', 'doctor', 'finally', 'interstellar', 'traveler', 'Tom', 'again', 'again', 'cheat', 'death', 'ensure', 'eternity', 'dearly', 'beloved', 'Izzi', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'only', 'lose', 'time', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'Aronofsky', 'theme', 'look', 'inevitability', 'death', 'powerful', 'say', 'least', 'secret', 'Aronofsky', ""n't"", 'present', 'film', 'most', 'accessable', 'manner', 'intention', 'not', 'film', 'one', 'can', 'just', 'walk', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Fountain', 'slow', 'moving', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'journey', ""n't"", 'easy', 'take', 'do', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'truly', 'special', 'indeed', 'Jackman', 'absolute', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'that', 'as', 'well', 'amazing', 'special', 'effects', 'mostly', 'done', 'CGI', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'alone', 'Simply', 'put', 'Fountain', 'masterpiece', 'modern', 'film', 'making', 'be', 'forewarned', 'not', 'film', 'tastes', 'audiences', 'do', 'check', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'give', 'second', 'viewing', 'give', 'chance']",N/A

For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.-  _Genesis_ 2:16 - 7._The Fountain_ (2006) is a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which combines themes from various religions and science fiction concerning the fact of mortality.  Unfortunately, the movie combines these themes into nothing more than a syncretic neo-Gnostic porridge and thus fails to achieve any sort of redeeming message.  The film has three strands of development which make it difficult to follow, tracing the activities of a scientist as he attempts to discover a cure for his cancer-striken wife.  While the movie features themes from Roman Catholicism, the religion of the ancient Mayas, and Buddhism, it should be noted that the underlying message is ultimately Gnostic in origin - featuring the age old conflict at root in the Garden of Eden and behind mankind's Faustian quest for knowledge.  The film shows a Catholic inquisitor opposing the quest for immortality and makes the case that such figures are reactionary.  (We can see such conflict between moralists and those who support the diaboleries of the scientifically managed state today.)However, the film fails to note the contrast between earthly life and the promised life in the world to come.  The film also fails to appreciate the true meaning of the Fall from Grace in the Christian faith.  As such, the movie enters into the realms of the heretical Gnostics who sought to create God's Kingdom here on earth.  Christian philosophers have long warned against such attempts to ""immanentize the eschaton"" as Eric Voegelin put it and have repeatedly noted how such attempts have led to the various totalitarian political religions of our age.  (Such attempts are also at root behind the utopian urges that have given rise to the scientifically managed state.)  In his quest to achieve immortality for his wife, the scientist/conquistadore turns his back on the traditional Christian understanding of the human soul.  As such, this movie can only be seen for what it is, as a profoundly anti-Catholic film.  It should also be added that the blending of religious traditions makes for a disconcerting effect, with no clear-cut boundaries between each such tradition.  In this respect, the film reduces all such traditions to ultimate meaninglessness and thus fails to achieve anything ultimately lasting or worthwhile.

One may say, The Fountain may fall in that category because it contains the traits in most Aronofsky films, Pi, Requiem For a Dream, and Black Swan.  But one thing that is evident in his films, how he associates man and nature and tests the limits of each through various methods that surpasses filmmaking and delves into the deeper realms of critical and analytical thinking, history, metaphysics, philosophy and religion, and science and technology; this list may be much longer depending on the viewers' interests and perceptions may differ.  However, what makes the film of great interest are not only the main actors Hugh Jackman who plays a doctor-scientist-researcher Tommy Creo and Rachel Weisz his wife Izzi Creo a writer who is dying of cancer, but how Aronofsky interweaves all of the elements mentioned above and produces a film of diverse cinematography.The film contains extremely creative content that appears immediately during the beginning of the film that shows a series of fragments and abstracts that the average viewer will see and want to understand.  But once one observes the parallels and the correlations of what is occurring within the framework of the film and the storyline, greater meaning may come about.  Indeed, the characters are the center of attention of the film, Tommy a scientist and doctor that wants only the best for his wife Izzi as she is experiencing the challenges of her illness and the imminent - Tommy is working day and night to come up with a cure through lab experiments on a Rhesus monkey.  But the story subtly suggests that Tommy is having difficulties accepting Izzi's condition and continues to work effortlessly while Izzi appears relaxed without a care in the world.  In between these scenes include a slew of symbolic imagery, Tommy opens a manuscript of a book that Izzi is writing that is called The Fountain, which involves a Spanish Conquistador and the mysterious and cryptic elements of the nebula star and a Mayan inscription, and another scene appears futuristic and involves the tree of life.  Although these scenes may not fit together, one way to look at each one, the bigger picture - nature sets its course and is in full control.The Fountain is a much recommendable for viewers looking for a thought provoking and definitely tests one's perceptions type of film.

648156,A2L7WYA5OENV03,B00005JPAR,Reticuli,"[0, 0]","The FountainI'm reminded of what I believe was a Charlie Rose, or maybe it was a magazine article, where either a doctor or a futurist made a reference to western culture's fixation on curing death, as if it were a curable disease like any other and not an inevitability.  That this potentially poisons ourselves and through extreme fear & grief impedes our ability to be in-the-now is something eastern cultures seem to have come to grips with long ago.  I found the subject matter heartfelt and do not have a problem saying ""This film moved me.""  Because it did.Thank goodness The Orleans Casino had a gal who knew what she was doing with the projector.  There was some problem with the shutter not opening all the way at the beginning of the film, but eventually we got it worked out and the bottom half of the print became fully lit in all its glory.  Those efforts were well rewarded.  I found The Fountain visually stunning and did not at any time find it to be silly, though it has quite a few moments of abstract and open-endedness to it.  For instance, why is the nebula bringing life back to this tree?  Maybe I missed a part during the efforts to fix the shutter, but it seemed as if we are simply left to assume the power of the tree and the nebula are connected.  The tree's life-giving abilities have been nearly used-up by this doctor who obviously has taken advantage of them and stayed alive far, far into the future.  So far, in fact, that his space ship appears to us as simply an elastic, transparent bubble that is capable of making new bubbles (space ships) around him at will.  We have no idea how it works, but it clearly does...at least to those viewers who allow the film to be what it is and make an initial and respectful suspension of disbelief to allow its own rules to be established and worked within.  I think a caveman would say the same for my computer screen.  So we are cavemen to this futureman.  The technology is so advanced as to be, not to be redundant, literally and figuratively totally simple, elastic, and transparent to its end-user.  Neat concept.  Can any of you think of a better way to illustrate the ultimate technology of the far future?  I can't.Interestingly, because this new tree was planted on her grave, she is somehow now a part of it.  This is a call-back from an earlier set-up accomplished by a story she previously told.  Through eastern meditation and consuming of the bark, he appears to be reliving the elements of his past, reminiscent of Wim Wender's meandering and overly-long Until The End of The World.  As in that film, this virtual living in the past is a kind of egotistical black hole of stagnation.  Here I think it works better, since we as the audience are brought along on the narrative by his re-experiencing of the events from the very beginning, rather than it being a secondary structure at the end.  Quite a number of people seem to think the conquistador thread was an actual historical past for the film characters, but forget that it is Izzi's book as ""visualized"" by Tommy as he reads (or read), and who injects he and his wife into the central characters.  This historical allegory of unfinished novel, the past when he was a doctor, and the present-future are all three intertwined.  The futuristic returning to the Garden of Eden to partake of the Tree of Life creates a new Adam and Eve, I think, both immortal in different ways.  By doing so he has lost his perspective, though.I found the duality curious that eastern meditation was both the key to exploiting this endless reliving in the first place with the Izzi-tree and the means to bring himself to end it, by finally visualizing a suitable ending to his wife's book.  In order to re-attain wisdom and appreciate once more the true reality and, indeed the past-nature of, that beautiful relationship once more outside of this clouded, emotionally-distorted & fixational abyss of immortality, there is only one thing the doctor can do: partake of the Tree of Wisdom, which is death.  In this way, just as the novel took on characteristics of their lives, life also takes on characteristics of a story, which is one way to find solace in mortality if that is something you are willing to accept, where life has a beginning, middle, and an end, yet is perfect in its own completeness.Viewing The Fountain is not a passive experience, intellectually or emotionally, and you no doubt will bring a great deal of baggage on its subjects of love, death, immortality, consciousness, and eastern thought.  I suspect the strongest feelings will oddly enough be on that last item, even though it is only a tool and framework to explore the rest.  I can see quite a few people being turned-off seeing a bald Hugh Jackman floating in the lotus position to his literal and figurative finale.  Is it silly?  I don't think so.

Writers are deep thinkers. The core actors here put their heart and soul into this. So they have no opinions? Nothing to say?This is an endemic problem with American cinema. These teams can make a profound movie, and yet totally lack the depth or awareness to actually talk about the issues it brings up.Who cares how they created the light at the end of the corrider in the hospital? Really? Do we need to hear this explained? How different colors of light were used etc etc ad nauseum?Who gives a flying !@$#% about that? Who cares about the sets they built in Australia, then dismantled and sold off...? All of this technical garbage on the DVD extras is a waste of time and has nothing to do with how people are affected by this film. Yet you sit through all of this (sum total as long as the film itself) waiting for something interesting from the crew and cast and writers about how the story itself had meaning for them...and nothing...I liked the film. I &#34;got it&#34; and I thought it all tied together well. And so, you'd expect at least a few minutes of commentary on the DVD extras by the actors, the writers, the director, about what this all meant for them personally. Yes we hear them talk about how production was shut down after two years and then restarted independently. Still, this is pointless to the effect the film has on its viewers.Classic example of shallowness on the part of the Hollywood industry. They can feed us all sorts of profound visionary cinema, but they totally lack the depth to contemplate its meaning themselves or the character to discuss what they just produced...The idea of the world tree/the tree of life, is as old as civilization itself.

Riggs ""Rob Riggs""","[3, 4]","What interests me most about this film is the idea that, through death and rebirth, two souls may still be bound to each other. In each life, Hugh Jackman is trying to save his lover, Rachel Weisz. In the first life, Jackman discovers the tree of life and becomes a part of it. In the present life, he uses the tree's medicinal values to discover an anti-aging complex. And in the future, he is an ascetic, a man devoted to meditation, and his wife a tree. This evolution has both Biblical and Eastern religious themes, and all becomes one at the end. What is interesting to note is that the dying star they are moving toward has a nebulous wrapped around it... a shining metaphor for Jackman wrapped around his dying wife, doing all he can to save her.The cinematography in this film is beautiful, the movie itself is a poem. Coupled with Clint Mansell's music, there are part of this film that move me to moments of pure inspiration, specifically as they move toward the star at the end and Jackman has a moment of enlightenment before the star explodes and new life forms. We witness the constant transference of energy from one form to the next, and Jackman in the end becomes acutely aware of it.Maybe I am reading too much into the film, maybe not enough. In our current state of Hollywood franchises, where every movie is made with its sequel, and commercial products in mind, The Fountain is a rare work. One that is not meant to merely entertain, but to think about the larger scale of where we are, where we have been, and where we are ultimately going.There are some obvious contradictions between the movie's quotations from the Bible and ultimately its Buddhist concept of death and rebirth. But it only references origins in the Bible, not destinations. Maybe at some point, in our human translations, our translators have taken different roads. But I like the idea of all things are one, beginning from and returning to the same place.I give it 4 stars because there are a few lines from Jackman that seem both unconvincing and absurd. One is here he says something about finding life, when he is going toward the tree of life as a conquistador. Other times, when he talks about his need to save his wife, he just doesn't seem to believe it wholeheartedly.",4,"A look at two souls bound to one another, lifetime after lifetime.....",1180396800,"05 29, 2007",2007,2271,"['What', 'interests', 'most', 'film', 'idea', 'death', 'rebirth', 'two', 'souls', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'bound', 'other', 'life', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'trying', 'save', 'lover', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'first', 'life', 'Jackman', 'tree', 'life', 'part', 'present', 'life', 'tree', 'medicinal', 'values', 'discover', 'anti-aging', 'complex', 'future', 'ascetic', 'man', 'devoted', 'meditation', 'wife', 'tree', 'evolution', 'Biblical', 'Eastern', 'religious', 'themes', 'one', 'end', 'What', 'interesting', 'note', 'dying', 'star', 'are', 'moving', 'nebulous', 'wrapped', 'shining', 'metaphor', 'Jackman', 'wrapped', 'dying', 'wife', 'doing', 'can', 'save', 'her.The', 'cinematography', 'film', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'poem', 'Coupled', 'Clint', 'Mansell', 'music', 'are', 'part', 'film', 'move', 'moments', 'pure', 'inspiration', 'specifically', 'move', 'star', 'end', 'Jackman', 'moment', 'enlightenment', 'star', 'explodes', 'new', 'life', 'forms', 'witness', 'constant', 'transference', 'energy', 'one', 'form', 'next', 'Jackman', 'end', 'acutely', 'aware', 'it.Maybe', 'am', 'reading', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'enough', 'current', 'state', 'Hollywood', 'franchises', 'where', 'movie', 'made', 'sequel', 'commercial', 'products', 'mind', 'Fountain', 'rare', 'work', 'One', 'not', 'meant', 'merely', 'entertain', 'think', 'larger', 'scale', 'where', 'are', 'where', 'have', 'been', 'where', 'are', 'ultimately', 'going.There', 'are', 'obvious', 'contradictions', 'movie', 'quotations', 'Bible', 'ultimately', 'Buddhist', 'concept', 'death', 'rebirth', 'only', 'origins', 'Bible', 'not', 'destinations', 'Maybe', 'point', 'human', 'translations', 'translators', 'have', 'taken', 'different', 'roads', 'like', 'idea', 'things', 'are', 'one', 'beginning', 'returning', 'same', 'place.I', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'are', 'few', 'lines', 'Jackman', 'seem', 'unconvincing', 'absurd', 'One', 'here', 'something', 'finding', 'life', 'when', 'going', 'tree', 'life', 'conquistador', 'Other', 'times', 'when', 'need', 'save', 'wife', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'believe', 'wholeheartedly']",N/A

In this respect, it is very much akin to 2001, though focuses on the love that a couple shares across time and space.  The first time frame is colonial Spain, right smack in the worst excesses of the Reformation.  A brave aristocrat (Jackman) is sent on a mission by the beleaguered queen (Weisz), on a mission to find the tree of life that has been hidden by Mayan priests; this tree is said to offer eternal life in the mythologies of both peoples, but in different ways.  The second time is the present, when a research doctor is searching for a cure for the cancer that is killing his wife, a writer whose story covers that of the Spanish and the next one, the quest of a man flying to a dying star, in accordance with Mayan prophesy; he is transporting the tree, which is failing, and lives with the memory of his wife who is long since dead.From the film, it is impossible to tell what is real, what is imagined, and what it means.  The tree appears in all 3 sequences, as do the characters, who may or may not be the same individuals.  The themes - of love, loss, and hope - are present in all times, where the link of new life to death is apparent and mysterious.  During the entire film, I was able to forget my real life and wonder at the questions and ideas that the film offered, which is an extremely rare experience for me and marks the film as a great success.  The grief and struggle are very moving, the images of merging into light, of killing, of rebirth, are spectacular.According to the extras, this was toned down from the original, which was supposed to have Brad Pitt (one of the most over-rated actors, IMHO) rather than Jackman; Weisz replaced Cate Blanchett.

Its not every movie that attempts to explore death, obsession, spirituality, rebirth, sickness, and devotion.  I get the feeling that this movie will work wonderfully for some people and less so for others.  But I think it's impossible to tell you which one you might be.  See the movie for yourself and make your own decision.I think the visuals are the most interesting and impressive element of the film.  Aronofsky is working with three separate worlds (or realities or time periods).  Each has a unique look and yet each one has elements tying it to the other.  There is an over riding color scheme of yellow and black that gives the film a unique look (I just watched another movie that used a similar visual palate; the 2001 Japanese/Polish film ""Avalon"".  Also worth seeing).  In addition to the visuals, the sound and music work very well with the movie, blending it together and providing an overall mood to the film.Acting is solid throughout.  Hugh Jackman does a great job in all three roles (or is it two, or is it one?).  His passion, love and obsession are very clear and potent, making his character the most realized of the group.  Rachel Weisz does the best she can with an underwritten role.  She's brave, full of life and hope.  We see elements of why Tommy loves her, but something is missing in her character (something that I feel was missing in the script, not the performance).  The supporting cast is excellent and up to task.I've only seen one other film by Aronofsky, ""Pi"".  I really enjoyed that movie and it's daring.  I can see elements of that film here.  In the end I feel that some of the weaker characterization of the two leads ends up weakening the overall impact of the film.  Instead of feeling an emotional thrill at the climax, I felt satisfied, but not awed.  I think that Aronofsky was hoping for more than just satisfaction with this film.I know some viewers found the film to be confusing or obtuse.  I didn't.  The movie makes perfect sense, but you do have to pay attention.  The three worlds presented are linked (not just visually and thematically but in the plot as well).  Some of the film seems a bit heavy handed to me.  And I feel that Aronofsky didn't need to present such clear answers in the film.  When covering ideas like death, rebirth, spirituality and science there might not be any clear answers.I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something different and visually interesting.  Some viewers are going to really connect with it and others are going to just blink and say ""That was pretty and all, but what was it all about?""  I enjoyed it, but I wished I could have loved it as much as Aronofsky seems to.  You can feel that this was a labor of love.",4,"Obsession, eternal life, and a trip to end... or the beginning.",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2778,"['love', 'what', 'director', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'attempted', 'here', 'not', 'movie', 'explore', 'death', 'obsession', 'spirituality', 'rebirth', 'sickness', 'devotion', 'get', 'feeling', 'movie', 'will', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'people', 'less', 'so', 'others', 'think', 'impossible', 'tell', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'See', 'movie', 'yourself', 'make', 'own', 'decision.I', 'think', 'visuals', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'impressive', 'element', 'film', 'Aronofsky', 'working', 'three', 'separate', 'worlds', 'realities', 'time', 'periods', 'unique', 'look', 'yet', 'one', 'tying', 'other', 'riding', 'color', 'scheme', 'yellow', 'black', 'film', 'unique', 'look', 'just', 'watched', 'movie', 'used', 'similar', 'visual', 'palate', '2001', 'Japanese/Polish', 'film', 'Avalon', 'Also', 'worth', 'seeing', 'addition', 'visuals', 'sound', 'music', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'blending', 'together', 'providing', 'overall', 'mood', 'film.Acting', 'solid', 'Hugh', 'Jackman', 'great', 'job', 'three', 'roles', 'two', 'one', 'passion', 'love', 'obsession', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'potent', 'making', 'character', 'most', 'realized', 'group', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'best', 'can', 'underwritten', 'role', 'brave', 'full', 'life', 'hope', 'see', 'elements', 'why', 'Tommy', 'something', 'missing', 'character', 'something', 'feel', 'was', 'missing', 'script', 'not', 'performance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'up', 'task.I', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'Aronofsky', 'Pi', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'daring', 'can', 'see', 'elements', 'film', 'here', 'end', 'feel', 'weaker', 'characterization', 'two', 'leads', 'up', 'weakening', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'Instead', 'feeling', 'emotional', 'thrill', 'climax', 'felt', 'satisfied', 'not', 'awed', 'think', 'Aronofsky', 'was', 'hoping', 'more', 'just', 'satisfaction', 'film.I', 'know', 'viewers', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'confusing', 'obtuse', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'perfect', 'sense', 'do', 'have', 'pay', 'attention', 'three', 'worlds', 'presented', 'are', 'linked', 'not', 'just', 'visually', 'thematically', 'plot', 'well', 'film', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', 'feel', 'Aronofsky', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'present', 'such', 'clear', 'answers', 'film', 'When', 'covering', 'ideas', 'death', 'rebirth', 'spirituality', 'science', 'there', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'clear', 'answers.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'visually', 'interesting', 'viewers', 'are', 'going', 'really', 'connect', 'others', 'are', 'going', 'just', 'blink', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'what', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'wished', 'could', 'have', 'loved', 'as', 'much', 'Aronofsky', 'can', 'feel', 'was', 'labor', 'love']",N/A

648181,A6FIAB28IS79,B00005JPAR,Samuel Chell,"[2, 7]","[Noticing the substantive, thoughtful, even passionate responses that this film has elicited from many reviewers, I retract any elements of my own review that may sound dismissive, patronizing, presumptuous.  Obviously, numerous viewers find the film provocative, innovative, mysterious, profound and deeply moving in terms substance and form, meaning and creative use of the medium.  Any film these days that's able at once to challenge, enthrall, and motivate viewers to become alert and ""active"" spectators deserves no small amount of commendation--and most likely another look (at the very least) from this reviewer.  I would take issue with the notion that the film is sentimental or pretentious--or that either of those words is necessarily pejorative (Griffith was certainly pretentious but no less of a giant; ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is as sentimental as it is dark, but not even the anti-sentimental '60s and '70s could suppress Capra's neglected but vibrantly alive American ""basic text"" for long.  Still, as informative and healthy as informed discussion can be, we will never (thank god) escape the fact that many of the medium's greatest accomplishments will not get their just due, and that one viewer's ""Citizen Kane"" will be another's ""Star Wars: The Latest Sequel.""]D.W. Griffith needed six hours (""Intolerance,"" original release) to tell four simultaneous, closely interlocked stories separated in time by 2500 years.  The result was one of film's noblest failures.  Chris Marker, on the other hand, required less than 30 minutes (""La Jetee"")  to tell an unforgettable story about humankind's fear of death, desire for love, and the ensuing but inescapable struggle with the past, the present, and the future to conquer death and aloneness.At about 90 minutes, ""The Fountain"" succeeds in fascinating us with its surrealist, psychedelic imagery, and if it fails to convince some that it has something significant to say or its meaning as clear as some would like, it's not for lack of trying.  In fact, everything about this film all but shrieks at the viewer ""important allegory,"" ""vital parable,"" ""deep, profound, thought-provoking cinema.""  Doesn't matter if it's a flower bud, a finger, a ring (the latter are certainly overworked symbols, especially after Dante and Wagner rung from rings just about all the meaning they're capable of yielding, though admittedly that didn't discourage Joseph Campbell, whose monomythic circle representing the hero's journey has become the frequent formula of no small number of the screenplays we see these days)--it's all deeply, profoundly, evocatively significant.  And lest we have the least doubt, the score bleats at us non-stop with throbbing strings italicized by spiritual soprano choirs--somber minor key modalities and thick textures relieved occasionally by new-age piano light rays. In fact, it's the kind of score that, unlike the reactionary constructions of a John Williams', takes us further away from the exemplary work of a Bernard Herrmann or Hugo Friedhofer.Of the three stories, only the one in the present--of the doctor desperately seeking a cure for his beloved's illness (cancer, but in the terms of the story, death is the ""illness"")--has any humanity, any semblance of ""life"" (though even here, the acting seems at times a bit stiff and ""operatic,"" a hostage to the symbolism of the story, orchestrated by the camera and effects.)  The other two stories are narrative ""frames,"" occasionally shedding some illumination on what is one of the darkest films (literally) I've ever seen (including hundreds of film noir examples along with most of Bergman).  Despite the inevitable pretense of the genre, there are the best of intentions, one suspects, behind the film, and young viewers who are taken in by it sufficiently to watch it again and work out its symbolism are undeniably apt to be rewarded, especially compared to the viewers of a ""Titanic,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" or any number of more childish (not merely sophomoric) ""fantasy genre"" movies (again, not a negative so much as a mere observation--certainly the inclusion of Clarence is sufficient to qualify Capra's seasonal classic as ""fantasy"" genre).Moreover, visual-architectural enthusiasts will have much to admire in the match cutting (from faces to symmetrical and luminescent correlatives, both man-made and natural, and the camera angles (those overhead aerial shots!), which often play more like music than the music does.  But were I a fan of a more hard-core, cleverly-engineered and artfully designed fantasy (I won't belabor a definition here--though Dante's Comedia and Wagner's Ring, despite sharing similarities with the genre, are as much its antithesis as is, say, ""Tokyo Story.""), I'd be more inclined to study the script and mis en scene (which even a movie like ""Donnie Darko"" can repay with insights not sighted after a mere two screenings).  Time is precious, and I'm grateful the filmmakers of ""The Fountain"" elected not to overextend their welcome.  Nonetheless, two hours of ""There Will Be Blood"" strikes me as a movie more worthy of close study than ""The Fountain"" if only because, as Dr. Johnson required of dramatic art and found so readily present in Shakespeare's, it ""holds the mirror up to nature"" (film's verisimilitudinous strong suit) so that we can see it, as if for the first time.A quick interpretation, maybe more Mishima than Buddhist: You can't ""have"" the Tree of Life because you ARE the tree.  To have it, to obtain it, to acquire or possess it, is to ""objectify"" it--in other words, to rob it of life.  Only the subject is alive: the object necessarily dead.  Once we recognize our relationship to the tree of life, we are eternally alive, immune from mundane materialistic understandings of death. There is no taking away from us what we never actually  ""had"" because the tree is what we ""are.""  Coming into ""possession"" of this understanding, or state of blessed ""nothingness,"" requires undergoing the quest of the conquistador, doctor, scientist, lover in the movie.",3,Cryogenic

Rather, they say, everything happens at once, and we only perceive it sequentially. Time is merely an artifact of existence and experience. Perhaps this is part of the concept that powered writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (Requiem for a Dream, Pi) latest effort, The Fountain. Like origami, this film folds in on itself, with three stories spanning a thousand years overlapping like a Moebius strip, interleaving plane to plane until the film unfurls into one loosely unified fable of love, loss, tragedy and spirituality. The Fountain is no movie for skeptics or cynics; they will probably be impatient with its experimental narrative structure and repeating imagery. The multilayered plot is built on a simple notion: a pair of lovers follow one another through various incarnations ranging from medieval Spain to some far future, soulmates determined to surpass death, cycling in and out of bodies but always together. The idea is that when God cast mankind out of the Garden of Eden for tasting the Tree of Knowledge, He hid its twin, the Tree of Life, in the New World. When discovered by Franciscans working for Queen Isabella of Spain (Rachel Weisz of The Constant Gardener), she sends her trusted Conquistador Tomas (Hugh Jackman, The Prestige) to secure it, promising to be his Eve if he is successful. It takes him over a thousand years to find the true meaning of the Tree, during which he and Isabella/Izzi cycle in and out of conjoined incarnations, linked by love, a ring, and a dream of immortality.Several ideas not in current intellectual fashion feed the dark energy of this movie: eternal love, spiritual transformation, the idea of soulmates. Romantic conceits such as this in the Age of Irony are usually confined to art house movies; indeed, The Fountain resembles nothing so much as an art house film that has fallen into money. And oh, what they've done with that money --- layer on layer of gorgeous images. Honey colored star fields, bleak snow-filled valleys echoing despair, a tree that truly looks like a Tree of Life, the filth of the Spanish Inquisition and the claustrophobic humidity of Mayan jungles. Symbols permeate this film: a ring is given in 15th century Spain, lost in a 21st century surgical prep room. Hugh Jackman drives a car through a sporadically lit tunnel towards a city of light and hope, then rides a horse down a torch-lit road towards a city of flame and tyranny. Life literally bursts forth in Tomas, ink becomes blood and dead lovers become trees. Not since Vincent Ward's What Dreams May Come have I seen such imagery infuse a movie.The ubiquitous Hugh Jackman uncorks a sobbing, glowing, tragic, erotically charged performance perhaps matched only by his charismatic turn in The Prestige. Alas, this performance threatens to overwhelm his scenes with Rachel Weisz, whose attempts at subtlety sometimes merely flatten her portrayal of the doomed Izzi. To be fair, however, her role is basically to act as numinous avatar, not as a real human being. Her role ranges from regal Queen to plucky gamine, but she is never given the incandescent scenes Jackman sears through. Their chemistry is just barely enough to convince. Still, Jackman's performance was powerful enough to persuade me that his shaven-headed Zen monk was in love with a tree, without making me break into giggles. Supporting actress Ellen Burstyn (Wicker Man) turns in a subdued portrayal of a harassed but sympathetic lab director. Clint Mansell's ethereal and evocative score provides an emotional carrier wave for the film so powerful it deserves Supporting Actor billing.Six years in the making, this film still needs more editing to lift it out of several shallow plot holes; brain tumors, calligraphy, monkey research, biopharmaceutical research, nebulae and eternal life intertwine in a sometimes chaotic mix. Despair and hope suffuse this movie like brandy soaks a rich cake, and like that cake, a little ambiguity may go a long way with those viewers looking for a more conventional narrative. One is left with some questions: for example, why is a movie about the quest for the Tree of Life called The Fountain? Why, in a movie about a love that transcends time, does Queen Isabella keep reappearing to insist that it's all about saving Spain from the Inquisition? Another rewrite was probably in order here, but I have to admire Aronofsky's courage in giving us so many angles on the same story. When so many movies are composed by connecting the dots, it is refreshing to see even a flawed attempt to rearrange the dots into something novel and visionary. If you read books as much for the joy of beautifully cascading prose as for the story, if you enjoy the intertwining streams of improvisational jazz, if you like your science fiction more Stanley Kubrick than George Lucas, you may appreciate The Fountain, a poem brought to the screen which, if sometimes more beautiful than profound, never fails to enchant. The Fountain is destined to be a cult movie, admired as much for its ambitious flaws as its resonant triumphs.",5,One of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched,1170115200,"01 30,

The movie is a collage of scenes of an artsy film. There are a lot of repeated scenes apparently in an attempt to keep the audience on track of the story and in which direction the flick is moving. Needless to say, that the trailer seemed to promise something different and therefore my expectations weren't met at all.The acting was very good and that's why I give this film 3 stars, because otherwise it would be less than that. I don't think Aronofsky as a director did a very good job of telling the story - it's a lot of going back and forth with some boring scenes, ... confusing with New Age junk mixed into it. In a sense it's like an unfinished cinematic painting, and the soundtrack is kind of annoying after a while. And whenever a scene reaches a climax and there's an expectation for a surprise, nothing happens and it's a letdown.

After seeing them I was amazed but confused, and thats how I felt when I viewed the entire film years later, but after thinking about the film and discussing it with some friends I figured it out and I was blown away by its beautiful complexity. ""The Fountain"" follows three story lines. The first is about a scientist whose wife is dieing of brain steam cancer. He spends all of his time devoted to finding a cure but to no avail. The second follows his wife when she takes up a hobbie and writes a book about a conquistador who is sent on a quest to find the fountian of youth for his queen. Her book is played out in live action as she's writing it and provides a really cool tie in to the film. The third story is the strangest. It basiclly watches the scientist as he floats up through space in a big bubble(Stay with me here)while he meditates by a big tree. These three parts intertwine to make one of the most inovative and visually stunning films I've ever seen. It's hard to explain how beautiful the film is and it's honestly one of those ""You have to see it to believe it"" cases. Alot of people who say they didn't like ""The Fountian"" say it's because they didn't understand it. Just because YOU didn't understand dosen't make it bad.

But today (06/17/10) I saw it again on blu-ray and had a connection and understanding to this film that I did not have previously.I know now that this story has to be understood as two bookends supporting the center. On the left we have the story which takes place in the past. The story of ""The Fountain."" A Spanish conquistador in quest of the tree of life for the queen of Spain.On the right we have a distant future explorer who is trying to transport a tree to the heart of the Orion nebula so that when a dying star in its heart explodes the energy released by the blast will revive the tree and give him and it eternal life.In the center we have the ""real"" story, a man who's wife is dying of a brain tumor.In order to deal with her own death and leave a legacy for her husband that may help him to understand her fight and ultimate acceptance of her own death, she writes a book called ""The Fountain."" This is the story I mentioned above of the Spanish conquistador in quest of the tree of life for the queen of Spain. She writes 11 chapters of this story and we see this story enacted through the movie with her as the queen besieged by the inquisition and her husband as the hero conquistador in quest of the tree of life to save her. The wife leaves the final 12th chapter (a complete cycle) for her husband to write after she dies.He does eventually write the final chapter and this chapter is the end of ""The Fountain"" story in the past and the creation of a new future story where he transports the tree I mentioned above into the heart of the exploding star so it can be reborn. This tree is actually his wife living on in this tree that was a born from a seed planted in her grave.The whole movie is a metaphor for love and death and acceptance and hope for eternal life. The chemistry between Hug Jackman and Rachel Weisz is amazing and actually this movie really is Hugh's best work as a serious actor. The pain he feels as he tries to deal with the inevitable death of his wife is heart breaking. The suffering and confusion is very honest.It is a beautiful film both visually and emotionally and deserves to be watched at different points in your life. I was not mature enough to appreciate it 3 years ago but today I am at a place where the genius of what was attempted by this film can find a home in my heart.One technical point - The blu-ray transfer is actually not very good. The sound is very low and the picture quality lacks contrast and color richness. The presentation is bland overall and this film deserves far, far better. But despite these technical short comings the film itself still powers through and touches.I highly recommend it and give it 5 stars even though Amazon will not let me update my star rating from 3 to 5.",5,"""Death Is the Road to Awe""",1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2870,"['saw', 'movie', '3', 'years', 'ago', '2007', 'gave', '3', 'star', 'review', 'ultimately', 'could', 'not', 'recommend', 'then', 'today', '06/17/10', 'saw', 'again', 'blu-ray', 'had', 'connection', 'understanding', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'previously.I', 'know', 'now', 'story', 'be', 'understood', 'two', 'bookends', 'supporting', 'center', 'left', 'have', 'story', 'place', 'past', 'story', 'Fountain', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'quest', 'tree', 'life', 'queen', 'Spain.On', 'right', 'have', 'distant', 'future', 'explorer', 'who', 'trying', 'transport', 'tree', 'heart', 'Orion', 'nebula', 'so', 'when', 'dying', 'star', 'heart', 'energy', 'released', 'blast', 'will', 'revive', 'tree', 'give', 'eternal', 'center', 'have', 'real', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'wife', 'dying', 'brain', 'tumor.In', 'order', 'deal', 'own', 'death', 'leave', 'legacy', 'husband', 'may', 'help', 'understand', 'fight', 'ultimate', 'acceptance', 'own', 'death', 'book', 'called', 'Fountain', 'story', 'mentioned', 'Spanish', 'conquistador', 'quest', 'tree', 'life', 'queen', 'Spain', '11', 'chapters', 'story', 'see', 'story', 'enacted', 'movie', 'queen', 'besieged', 'inquisition', 'husband', 'hero', 'conquistador', 'quest', 'tree', 'life', 'save', 'wife', 'final', '12th', 'chapter', 'complete', 'cycle', 'husband', 'write', 'dies.He', 'eventually', 'write', 'final', 'chapter', 'chapter', 'end', 'Fountain', 'story', 'past', 'creation', 'new', 'future', 'story', 'where', 'tree', 'mentioned', 'heart', 'exploding', 'star', 'can', 'be', 'reborn', 'tree', 'actually', 'wife', 'living', 'tree', 'was', 'born', 'seed', 'planted', 'grave.The', 'whole', 'movie', 'metaphor', 'love', 'death', 'acceptance', 'hope', 'eternal', 'life', 'chemistry', 'Hug', 'Jackman', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'amazing', 'actually', 'movie', 'really', 'Hugh', 'best', 'work', 'serious', 'actor', 'pain', 'deal', 'inevitable', 'death', 'wife', 'heart', 'breaking', 'suffering', 'confusion', 'very', 'honest.It', 'beautiful', 'film', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'be', 'watched', 'different', 'points', 'life', 'was', 'not', 'mature', 'enough', 'appreciate', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'today', 'am', 'place', 'where', 'genius', 'what', 'was', 'attempted', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'home', 'heart.One', 'technical', 'point', 'blu-ray', 'transfer', 'actually', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'sound', 'very', 'low', 'picture', 'quality', 'contrast', 'color', 'richness', 'presentation', 'bland', 'overall', 'film', 'far', 'far', 'better', 'technical', 'short', 'comings', 'film', 'still', 'touches.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'even', 'Amazon', 'will', 'not', 'let', 'update', 'star', 'rating', '3', '5']",N/A

I'm a hardcore sci-fi fan, I LOVE 2001, Blade Runner, Brazil, Solaris, to name a few; I like THX 1138, City of Lost Children, you have the picture.I don't know if it was the non-linear story line or the blurred real life, fantasy boundaries within the film, but I think the concept was too much and too much fast and furious in the delivery, since minute 1 the film tries to engage you with so many things that you don't know what's going on, it does not take the time to grow on you, or at least on me. I first thought that the spanish 'conquistador' was real life, then we find out that it's from a book, or maybe is both, so what we have then, reincarnation?I think the music is simple, sometimes cheesy, unworthy of the high concept of the movie. The acting is fine, I love Rachel Weisz, no matter what she is in. It ain't that the movie is bad, at a few moments I got interested, but I think it does'nt fulfill it's premise and it does not engage you emotionally as it should, just on the OK level.Furthermore, I'm an amateur astronomer, and they show Orion's nebula as a planetary nebula, that is a nebula of remains of a dead star, from which other stars will be formed in other regions of space in the next millions of years - life from death; but the real thing is that the Orion nebula is really a gigantic star nest, a stellar nursery of new stars, no remains of dead stars anywhere close -  a real life astronomical object appears as something it is not. That turned me off, it takes this film out from science fiction realm to the fantasy one, so the life-death theme becomes shallow, I just was not impressed.Try it at your own risk, I recommend to rent to be sure before you buy.By the way, this is not Kubrick, it does'nt even comes close.",2,2.5 stars,1185062400,"07 22, 2007",2007,1835,"['rent', 'movie', 'love', 'sci-fi', 'theme', 'sounded', 'very', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'hardcore', 'sci-fi', 'fan', 'LOVE', '2001', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Brazil', 'Solaris', 'name', 'few', 'like', 'THX', '1138', 'City', 'Lost', 'Children', 'have', 'picture.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'non-linear', 'story', 'line', 'blurred', 'real', 'life', 'fantasy', 'boundaries', 'film', 'think', 'concept', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'much', 'fast', 'furious', 'delivery', 'minute', '1', 'film', 'tries', 'engage', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'take', 'time', 'grow', 'least', 'first', 'thought', 'spanish', ""'conquistador"", 'was', 'real', 'life', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'book', 'maybe', 'so', 'what', 'have', 'then', 'reincarnation', 'think', 'music', 'simple', 'sometimes', 'cheesy', 'unworthy', 'high', 'concept', 'movie', 'acting', 'fine', 'love', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'matter', 'what', 'ai', ""n't"", 'movie', 'bad', 'few', 'moments', 'got', 'interested', 'think', 'fulfill', 'premise', 'not', 'engage', 'emotionally', 'should', 'just', 'OK', 'level.Furthermore', ""'m"", 'amateur', 'astronomer', 'show', 'Orion', 'nebula', 'planetary', 'nebula', 'nebula', 'remains', 'dead', 'star', 'other', 'stars', 'will', 'be', 'formed', 'other', 'regions', 'space', 'next', 'millions', 'years', 'life', 'death', 'real', 'thing', 'Orion', 'nebula', 'really', 'gigantic', 'star', 'nest', 'stellar', 'nursery', 'new', 'stars', 'remains', 'dead', 'stars', 'anywhere', 'close', 'real', 'life', 'astronomical', 'object', 'something', 'not', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'science', 'fiction', 'realm', 'fantasy', 'one', 'life-death', 'theme', 'shallow', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'impressed.Try', 'own', 'risk', 'recommend', 'rent', 'be', 'sure', 'buy.By', 'way', 'not', 'Kubrick', ""does'nt"", 'even', 'close']",N/A

You have the story of Tom, who was a doctor desperately looking for a cure for his wife's brain tumor.  She has dealt with her impending death, but he has not.  She writes a story of how he was a great conquistador searching for the Tree of Life in order to save her, the queen, and Spain.  A great metaphor, or allegory as it were, of their life and love for each other.  The only catch is that she asks him to write the last chapter of the story, therefore dealing with her death, for she knew it was just the beginning of the afterlife.  You can interpret the ending as you wish, is the bubble a spaceship of the future, or is it simply his spirit traveling to the afterlife?  There is eternal life, but it begins at death.The imagery is beautiful.  The special effects are awesome, especially considering the techniques used and the budget they worked with.

Probably the greatest aspect of this film is the intentional ambiguity of its interpretation, purposely put into the film by Aronofsky to make the viewer question their own mortality, as well as their views on love, death, and what it means to truly live.  I like seeing the story as one continuous narrative, with Thomas & Isabella as two star-crossed lovers meant to be together, but tested by time and mortality to the very limits of human existence.  I could go on all day about how many ways this film can be viewed, but suffice it to say, the more times you watch it, the more you notice.  Things like the recurring themes of the circle, the triangle, the human heart, as well as the endlessness of time really bring something original to this work of art that stays with you afterwards, and brings up more questions (as any truly great film should).  I'm so glad Brad Pitt dropped out of this movie, as he was completely wrong for the role, and I can't imagine anyone but Rachel Weisz in the role of Izzi.  Some critics have dismissed this film as a ripoff of 2001, but they are totally missing the point.  As that film dealt with the concept of extra-terrestrial communication and the nature of the cosmos, this one deals with humanity and its quest to overcome the limits the universe has placed on it.

The first time I was a little drowsy after a heavy dinner and a long day hiking, so could only appreciate that it was visually captivating. I really couldn't gather much meaning out of the entire affair, other than that the male lead clearly loved the female lead in both story lines within the film.On the second viewing I was blown away by the depth of this, and the artistry of it. Sure you could sum up the entire point of the thing in just a few paragraphs, but that wouldn't affect the viewer nearly as much as the artistry with which this director and writer reveal the wisdom of this film.If you like characters who grow over the course of a film in profound ways, then this is a film that will serve up a major dose of that for you. If you tend more toward action films, where a hero pursues a goal or defeats an enemy, even if you can figure out what this film is about, you will think it irrelevant.*** Spoilers ***If you have already watched this film and feel a fragmentary understanding dawning in you, hopefully this review will help clarify. Notice that he does in fact finish her novel for her.  And in the process of doing so, of writing the end of the story for both his wife's character and his own, he becomes a new person. His values utterly shift. Instead of clinging to this body for his wife within the eternity he wished to share with her, he accepts that only by letting go of this body, for both her and eventually himself, can they truly be together in eternity. He discovers that what he has been fighting against with such force, intellect, and passion for so long was in fact the very thing he was looking for. And with that he let's go of the fight against what is and surrenders himself into the awe of pure existence.Now you have to give a director a break in trying to visually translate all that as an experiential story instead of just telling the way I do in the above paragraph. That's the art.Recall the change in even his interpretation of his own life story (or maybe that's the time travel bit and he actually does go back and decide differently), as he decides to go out and play in the first snow with her in the last reflection on that moment, instead of continuing the research that led to his fountain of youth tree bark discovery.

648235,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B00005JPAR,tuberacer,"[4, 12]","Kubrick for a new generation? I don't think so. Puhleeaase! Kubrick never  made one of these Hollywood-churn cult of romantic love stories. Sentimental is a good term. Such stories were probably boring as sin for Stanley, unless they provided fodder for parody or irony. What's the closest Kubrick came to a love story? Cruise and Kidman in ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" or Humbert Humbert and Lolita? ""Spartacus"" doesn't count because it was not actually his conception, and the censors cut out the Kubrick-signature scene that alluded to homosexuality.  ""Barry Lyndon"" pointed at the ridiculousness of love and ""Full Metal Jacket"" had a couple of real touching love scenes with a couple of Vietnamese women, didn't it, similar to the love scenes in ""Clockwork Orange""? How about ""The Shining?"" Now there was a passionate romance, axe and all!Kubrick was a genius. Aronofsky is a college graduate playing to the box office. Kubrick was not, as in ""Fountain,"" pretentiously clumsy with clutter and sap (speaking of which, I'll never look at Elmer's Glue the same again--and we all thought Super Glue was the elixir of the gods!--Elmer should have put a halo around that smiling cow).Hugh Jackman is painful to watch. What an over-actor! That energy works as Wolverine but not in a goofball love story. You can always tell when an actor is overdoing it when they start spitting all over the place as they are expressing anguish. Poor Rachel. She was so often in the line of fire. I hope she had a rag and some liquid sanitizer handy on the set.Rachel was miscast. You never really fall hopelessly in love with Rachel Weisz, nor should you. She's always got a sense of something devious, or at least superiorily intelligent going on somewhere in back of her mind. They should have chosen some uncomplicated innocent beauty type to get the being hopelessly in love stuff across fast and comprehensible. Rachel is too smart an actress for this shallow part.I'd never even heard of this film until I saw it listed among the ""people who bought this DVD also bought"" section of the Amazon page for the 2002 version of ""Solaris""--a movie I loved (now there's a movie that's an homage to Stanley Kubrick full of unabashed, blatant theft of ""2001""). But ""The Fountain"" is not Science Fiction. It's Fantasy run amok via CGI. It's another in a recent trend of American films trying to do Magical Realism. Unfortunately, Magical Realism is grounded in Spanish/Latin culture and doesn't quite make it as an American artform. I guess the scenes in Spain and Latin America were supposed to help give the attempt credence.  It's interesting to see a trailer for ""Pan's Labyrinth"" on this DVD. That movie is Magical Realism at work and naturally effective reflecting its roots in its Spanish culture. As for Americans going Mayan, ""Fountain"" is like tourist metaphysics with a great slathering of the Old Testament and whatever else Aronofsky thought he could slip in. Not a great respect for Mayan culture, if you ask me. Personally, I got more entertainment when Predator and Alien were having at each other on the top of that same pyramid. Predator as the guardian of the Tree--there you go! Or maybe you could have him hanging out in the tree with his cloaking device on--""The Fountain II--Predator vs. the Buddha.""Like I say, Aronofsky's a college graduate putting the parts together like a learned engineer. Even in the behind the scenes features you don't get a sense that he actually feels this film. Floating around in the lotus position in space. Boy, that really tops ""2001""--bald-headed, no less. Real genius at work. I wonder if Kubrick ever arrived on one of his sets with his frat boys, took one look at it, and said, ""F*#% an A!"" (watch out, the special features have moments of deep expressiveness).Enough with all the CGI, Hollywood. Get back to actual drama. So what if computers can do all this? It's mostly just filler. My dog can spin around in a tutu. So what?If you like this movie, you might like ""Constantine."" Rachel's in that one too. I enjoyed that one. It's a much more fulfilling twist on the Biblical stories, and even has a sense of humor. ""Fountain"" has such a constant unending sense of droll throughout. The musical background is like a never-ending sea of oppression.You know, I was hoping the Tree of Life was not going to be an actual tree. Would have been a nice leap into new thought if it hadn't been. Kubrick probably wouldn't have made it a tree, either, but then, Kubrick wouldn't even have touched this purely cornball story.There's a difference between making a movie about a genius, and being a genius.

648245,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B00005JPAR,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[73, 93]","An epic film (at a non-epic length of 96 minutes), Darren Aronofsky's ambitious science fiction parable ""The Fountain"" demonstrates that the director wants to continue to make dense, emotionally complex films that require audience involvement. Although it isn't flawless, ""The Fountain"" is an enjoyable film that moves along at its own leisurely pace. Although ""The Fountain"" was critically attacked when it was released (it was booed at Cannes), it's an ambitious worthwhile film for those who have the patience and aren't expecting a explosion filled Summer blockbuster kind of movie. Aronosfky serves a different slice of ""pi"" here in trying to tackle the subject of mortality, reincarnation and the afterlife. It's a fascinating film even when it fails to reach beyond the rudimentary topic at hand.The different strands of this interlaced triptych have different success rates with the story involving the Conquistador's search for the Tree of Life that a Franciscan Monk (Mark Margolis) friendly to the Spanish throne may be able to find. If the Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) can find it, Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz)may survive the expanding inquisition. The present day story with Jackman as Dr. Tom Creo struggling to find the cure to his wife's cancer (she's writing a book called The Fountain which details the first part of the story about the Conquistador and his search. When Tom ""reads"" the story he's reading a metaphor about what is happening to his wife, his efforts to save her, etc.) all the while running into unintentional roadblocks from his boss (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar nominated performance) is along with the first, most successfully. The last segment set in the 26th Century while visually dazzling is the most cryptic much as Kubrick's ending for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was cryptic in tackling the concept of mortality and ""rebirth"". Again, it could be seen as Tom's efforts to save his wife from his perspective and his ultimate surrender to fate and the acceptance that he may not be able to save her in this life but can join her in the next.While Arononfsky's ambitious story may leap out of his grasp, there's much to admire in this visually stunning film. It won't be for everyone but like Kubrick's ""2001"" it will speak to a specific audience and the skill with which it is made will insure that its reputation (both for good and bad) will grow with time. In fact Aronofsky's film probably has more in common with the two versions of ""Solaris"" more than Kubrick's film with their consideration of life, death and how they impact those we love.Linking all six characters that Jackman and Weisz play is an interesting idea that might confuse those expecting the film to be literal. On the other hand, one could rationalize why they are in all three stories since it touches the attempt by Jackman's character in all three stories to try and defeat death allowing him to stay with the women he loves. Perhaps in some way they are the same ""characters"" constantly struggling to defeat death to stay together. You decide. Aronofsky takes an almost literary approach to the material eschewing the action-adventure approach of most film science fiction.For those interested in the DVD extras we get a six part featurette that can be viewed all at once that covers everything from the genesis of the project (when it was entitled ""The Last Man"") and the discussions that Aronofsky had with a Ari Handel (who co-wrote the story). They had many discussions about life, death and fate all of which were fed into this compelling film. It's amazing what Aronofsky gets away with given the low budget of the film. At one point the film went into turnaround when Brad Pitt and Cate Blachett pulled out of the film. Originally budgeted at $75 million, the production saw its budget sliced in half after Pitt left the production (reportedly due to creative differences with Aronofsky). Aronofsky lost his sets (they were auctioned off when Village Roadshows pulled out of the production as well)The fascinating, beautiful visual effects were achieved using micro-photography of chemical reactions on Petri dishes vs. with CGI and looks just as good (if not better) than some of the visual effects for similar films that have used CGI to portray a star about to go nova. We also get the original theatrical trailer. While that's nice, a good commentary track would have been a bit more revealing particularly during some of the more symbolic and over-the-top sequences of the film.Is ""The Fountain"" for everyone? No. Some will consider the film to be a pretentious hodge-podge of romantic/spiritual sci-fi and homage to Trakovsky's ""Solaris"".  ""The Fountain"" has more in common with Tarkvosky's ""Solaris"" than ""2001"" (although Tarkovsky's film is about a man trying to deaden himself against the living memory of the woman he loved). In that regard, ""The Fountain"" is a fine companion piece to both films (if a bit more esoteric and cryptic). I personally like ""The Fountain"" but it will take some patience to stay with the overlapping often intersecting storylines and absorb the ending of the film. ""The Fountain"" is thoughtful, emotional science fiction something of a rarity in today's bigger, louder, faster science fiction films.Solaris,Solaris - Criterion Collection,2001 - A Space

648251,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B00005JPAR,William Timothy Lukeman,"[7, 9]","Clearly this is a love it or hate it film, with very little middle ground. For those who want a linear, plot-driven story with everything explained, it can only be a vast, pretentious disappointment ... but for those who take it on its own mythic terms, a glorious & heartfelt journey awaits. It's meant to be experienced in an almost primal way, for it reaches down into the roots of the collective unconscious to tell its essentially simple but deep tale.Simple but deep? I think so. The plot, as much of it as there is, isn't complex: how we face or refuse to face death, especially when the loss of a life-enhancing love is concerned. It's the way it's told that gives it such depth, and why I call it symphonic -- this is a tone poem, one which repeats its motifs & images over & over again, layer upon layer of feeling which builds intensely, gathering momentum & emotional weight.Is Tom experiencing different lifetimes? That's certainly one possible interpretation. Or are the stories set in the past & future actually representations of an emotional, psychological reality? You can intellectually analyze this film & tease out many interpretations ... but in the end, it's meant to be FELT. Meaning & clarity hover on the edge of vision, just beyond complete understanding but somehow almost visible, not unlike remembering a vivid & deeply moving dream.The acting is superb, and the visuals match & enhance the emotions being played out before us.

I've seen Black Swan, The Wrestler, and each film has always left me unsatisfied.What do I mean by this?It means that when you get to the end of the movie, it never quite feels satisfying to have watched it. In this instance, for me, I felt that the character of Tommy was just too one dimensional and single minded. His only goal throughout the whole film is to save his wife and he obsesses over doing this throughout the film.But it's just not that interesting from a story perspective. The film is very well acted and the emotions felt very real, but when you get past the visual spectacle and make sense of the 3 storylines which are essentially the same thing, you realize that the movie is very repetitive. It essentially repeats to you three times on why you must accept death as a part of life.We see it with the ConquistadorWe see it with Tommyand then we see it when bald Tommy supposedly hits enlightenment.I'm also surprised that no reviewers mentioned the fact that there is a lot of buddhist symbolism in this movie. From bald Tommy crossing his legs, to the conquistador being reincarnated in a different form, to the visuals. A lot of it, to me, seemed like a form of reaching enlightenment. The problem with this movie, is that it told me the same thing 3 times, in albeit different forms.I would have preferred that this movie just stick with one storyline and follow it throught, or even reduce it down to two. The whole Spanish inquisition storyline and the visuals used for that were much more interesting than modern day Dr. Tommy.Overall, I think there's a better selection of movies out there. But, some people do enjoy this movie and it really wasn't that bad. I think I just need a better plot than just, my wife is dying times three. But so far the director is 0 for 3 in my book.",2,Doesn't feel very satisfying,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,1892,"['So', 'highly', 'possible', 'just', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'fan', 'Darren', 'Aronofsky', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Black', 'Swan', 'Wrestler', 'film', 'always', 'left', 'do', 'mean', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'never', 'quite', 'feels', 'satisfying', 'have', 'watched', 'instance', 'felt', 'character', 'Tommy', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'single', 'minded', 'only', 'goal', 'whole', 'film', 'save', 'wife', 'doing', 'film.But', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'story', 'perspective', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'emotions', 'felt', 'very', 'real', 'when', 'get', 'visual', 'spectacle', 'make', 'sense', '3', 'storylines', 'are', 'essentially', 'same', 'thing', 'realize', 'movie', 'very', 'repetitive', 'essentially', 'three', 'times', 'why', 'must', 'accept', 'death', 'part', 'life.We', 'see', 'ConquistadorWe', 'see', 'Tommyand', 'then', 'see', 'when', 'bald', 'Tommy', 'supposedly', 'enlightenment.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'surprised', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'lot', 'buddhist', 'symbolism', 'movie', 'bald', 'Tommy', 'crossing', 'legs', 'conquistador', 'being', 'reincarnated', 'different', 'form', 'visuals', 'lot', 'seemed', 'form', 'reaching', 'enlightenment', 'problem', 'movie', 'told', 'same', 'thing', '3', 'times', 'albeit', 'different', 'forms.I', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'movie', 'just', 'stick', 'one', 'storyline', 'follow', 'throught', 'even', 'reduce', 'down', 'two', 'whole', 'Spanish', 'inquisition', 'storyline', 'visuals', 'used', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'modern', 'day', 'Dr.', 'Tommy.Overall', 'think', 'better', 'selection', 'movies', 'there', 'people', 'do', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'think', 'just', 'need', 'better', 'plot', 'just', 'wife', 'dying', 'times', 'three', 'so', 'far', 'director', '0', '3', 'book']",N/A

It's beautiful, even if it tends towards a gold-sepia monochrome and big-face closeups. It manipulates your emotions, but does it well. More important: once the movie grabs your attention, it gives something grand in return. Remember how many art spectacles don't, then understand why that matters to me. It's beautiful, and it inspires sentiment that's more than a paperback-cover deep.If you can't feel why Jackman's scientist mourns in the lab, then you've missed most of the movie. I've felt that, a little, so I've glimpsed the uniquely human emotion being portrayed: hard, shining intellect driven by white-hot emotion. That feeling takes both; if you feel the need to argue, then you've never been taken up by that frame of mind. I think I understand a little about the conquistador, too: dying-deep love of queen and country, and personal bravery in every moment. None of that precludes art, including the devotion to a work that has to go beyond death. The work has its own life, and the human workmen must sometimes pass the vision on.""The Fountain"" is baffling and nonlinear. It cloys and it brutalizes. It's just beyond belief. It's probably the most involving and evocative movie I've seen in the last twenty years. It engages emotions that I have never been able to share with anyone, not in my whole life. Maybe, just maybe, you've spent a lot of your life all alone with feelings like mine. As of now, you're not alone any more.For all that, I'm still not sure whether it's a good movie. It's great, but I don't know whether it's good.

It is a sort of fantasy/allegory that focuses a lot more on style than character development, but I still found the plot to be coherent and the movie compelling enough to care about what was going on.  You need to be in a contemplative, patient mood to watch this movie: it is not exactly action-packed, and the themes and characterization are subtle.My principle complaint is that this edition is a major disappointment.  Underwhelming visuals, essentially devoid of special features, nothing packed in the box except the disc.  When I buy a Blu-ray movie I am expecting the definitive edition for the price I am being charged.  That means carefully mastered visuals, well-done commentary tracks, deleted scenes.
