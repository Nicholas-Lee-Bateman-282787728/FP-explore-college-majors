938523,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B000BB152A,Chris Kennison,"[26, 31]","David Blaine and Criss Angel are the forefront of magic in the new century. Why?  Gone are the parlor tricks we've become so accustom to, and now we have magic that will make watch in wonder... how did they do that?  Tricks on the street, with common observers. Tricks that not only take illusion, slight of hand and craftsmanship, but also take MENTAL TOUGHNESS and PREPAREDNESS.Some of the more dazzling things that Criss Angel does in season one will leave you awe-struck. Like when he walks DOWN THE SIDE OF A VEGAS BUILDING... or WALKS THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW. Even the little things... like levitating a frisbee that had landed on the ground, spinning it up to eye level and throwing it to an observer without ever toughing it. Or don't let me forget when he walks up to some random people in a park, puts a young girl into a trace, bends her BACKWARD at a 90 degree angle and then LEVITATES HER ENTIRELY.Of course there's the time when he levitates HIMSELF. I'm not talking a few inches off the ground like David Blaine did previously. I'm talking feet. Three feet. Four Feet. High enough to lift himself over a good sized dog. Not taking anything away from the equally incredibly David Blaine, but a nearby observer spoke the SAYS IT ALL COMMENT, ""Blaine needs to kiss this guys ass.""I don't know about that... Criss still hasn't done anything close to the most amazing trick that David Blaine did. Removing a wrist watch from a woman... walking a few feet down the street to a jewelry store where the woman's watch was displayed in the window... and being after hours, the store was closed, so he put his hand and arm through the glass right before our eyes and retrieves the watch.  Or creating water, wearing a sleeveless shirt with a single leaf for a jungle tribe that had no running water.Okay, okay... back to Criss Angel. The show is incredible. I watch it religiously. One of the things I find enduring about the show is the fact that Criss' brothers are part of his crew and it's kinda cool to see them worry about him when he does his tricks... even though... sometimes it looks sorta staged.Also, the fact that he includes other magicians in his show, like Lance Burton, Penn & Teller & the Amazing Johnathan. I'm just waiting for the 2 part episode where him and David Blaine team up... dear lord... wouldn't that be great!If anybody out there is complaining about Criss Angel and the validitiy of his tricks... I'd like to see the magicians that they're watching because I can't imagine that magic could get much better.",5,FOREFRONT of the MAGIC WORLD,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,2541,"['David', 'Blaine', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'are', 'forefront', 'magic', 'new', 'century', 'Why', 'Gone', 'are', 'parlor', ""'ve"", 'become', 'so', 'accustom', 'now', 'have', 'magic', 'will', 'make', 'watch', 'wonder', 'how', 'did', 'do', 'Tricks', 'street', 'common', 'observers', 'Tricks', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'illusion', 'slight', 'hand', 'craftsmanship', 'also', 'take', 'MENTAL', 'TOUGHNESS', 'PREPAREDNESS.Some', 'more', 'dazzling', 'things', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'season', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'awe-struck', 'when', 'walks', 'DOWN', 'THE', 'SIDE', 'A', 'VEGAS', 'BUILDING', 'WALKS', 'A', 'GLASS', 'WINDOW', 'Even', 'little', 'things', 'levitating', 'frisbee', 'had', 'landed', 'ground', 'spinning', 'eye', 'level', 'throwing', 'observer', 'ever', 'toughing', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'forget', 'when', 'up', 'random', 'people', 'park', 'young', 'girl', 'trace', 'BACKWARD', '90', 'degree', 'angle', 'then', 'LEVITATES', 'HER', 'ENTIRELY.Of', 'course', 'time', 'when', 'HIMSELF', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'few', 'inches', 'ground', 'David', 'Blaine', 'did', 'previously', ""'m"", 'talking', 'feet', 'Three', 'feet', 'Four', 'Feet', 'High', 'enough', 'lift', 'good', 'sized', 'dog', 'Not', 'taking', 'anything', 'away', 'equally', 'incredibly', 'David', 'Blaine', 'nearby', 'spoke', 'SAYS', 'IT', 'ALL', 'COMMENT', 'Blaine', 'kiss', 'guys', 'ass', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Criss', 'still', ""n't"", 'done', 'anything', 'close', 'most', 'amazing', 'trick', 'David', 'Blaine', 'did', 'Removing', 'wrist', 'watch', 'woman', 'walking', 'few', 'feet', 'street', 'jewelry', 'store', 'where', 'woman', 'watch', 'was', 'displayed', 'window', 'being', 'hours', 'store', 'was', 'closed', 'put', 'hand', 'arm', 'glass', 'right', 'eyes', 'watch', 'creating', 'water', 'wearing', 'sleeveless', 'shirt', 'single', 'leaf', 'jungle', 'tribe', 'had', 'running', 'water.Okay', 'okay', 'back', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'show', 'incredible', 'watch', 'religiously', 'One', 'things', 'find', 'enduring', 'show', 'fact', 'Criss', 'brothers', 'are', 'part', 'crew', 'kinda', 'cool', 'see', 'worry', 'when', 'tricks', 'even', 'sorta', 'staged.Also', 'fact', 'other', 'magicians', 'show', 'Lance', 'Burton', 'Penn', 'Teller', 'Amazing', 'Johnathan', ""'m"", 'just', 'waiting', '2', 'part', 'episode', 'where', 'David', 'Blaine', 'team', 'up', 'dear', 'lord', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'anybody', 'complaining', 'Criss', 'Angel', 'validitiy', 'tricks', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'magicians', ""'re"", 'watching', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'magic', 'could', 'get', 'much', 'better']",Criss Angel - Mindfreak - The Complete Season One

It was pretty lame.Criss has changed that by performing mind bending illusions in public. Not only does he perform illusions, he also performs death defying stunts.

The guy would do things that would literally make me gasp. But I guess that is what good magic is supposed to do, huh? It is supposed to get you to question what is real and what is not. Because I believe so strongly in the power of the mind and its ability to do anything, I often wonder if Criss Angel is giving us a preview of the possibilities that are inherent within each of us. Not that I'm particularly eager to be put in a pine box and go through a wood chipper.My wife, who practices Wicca, says that a lot of the things he is able to do are not illusions, he really is doing them. He is able to convince himself that he is the illusion and that the magic is real. Most spiritual masters believe that this every day reality isn't reality at all, it's all illusion; that there is really is nothing that is solid, that everything is Energy. Even Albert Einstein said this. But even though I have a feeling that they are right, that everything I see is simply a projection of my own mind and what it wants to believe, I'm going to leave it to Criss Angel to walk around on fire only to fall down, collapse, and have the fireman that put him out be Criss Angel himself. Huh? All I can say is, you gotta see it. Criss always comes out of these things with a smile on his face, which is also something that Spiritual Masters tend to do. Y'see, they know...we don't...we're left scratching those heads we think our so solid and so real.Do I recommend this collection?

Criss did alot of dangerous and mind-boggling things. One being hanging by his back from hooks, while a helecoptor suspends him hundreds of feet above the earth. That was cool. Another cool thing he did in Season 1, was being stricken by a tesla coil, and nearly being electrocuted to death due to a mishap. Then there was the episode where he was put into a barrel filled with water, suspended in air, and had to escape before the barrel plummeted to the ground, and killed him....These all may seem like ""stunts"", and not ""illusions"", but they were death-defying, and quite interesting. Heck, even some of the ""illusions"" in Season 1, were pretty cool. Such as when Criss cut his wrist open, to pull out an initialed quarter....Season 2 however strays away from alot of these cool looking stunts and illusions, and seems to present more unrealistic and even at times ""funny"" illusions. Such as pulling a woman in half. That wasn't realistic...it was funny, and somewhat stupid. Then at one time, Criss was sawn in half by a giant saw, but no blood was apparent during this entire illusion. Thus, proving none of it was real. Because obviously, if you cut anyone in half, they're going to bleed...to death.It saddens me to say that Season 2 just wasn't as interesting as Season 1 was. Call me a sucker for ""intense"" and ""bloody"" illusionry and stunts, but I don't find making an elephant disappear, very interesting. I've seen it done before countless times. Why would I wanna see Criss do it?Furthermore, I didn't like the fact that Criss had to spam the phrase ""we've never met before, correct?"" That just screams ""setup"". Saying it once in awhile is okay, but saying it in nearly every single Season 2 episode, just begs you to wanna scream at the guy.If he's so bent on proving what he's doing is real, then perhaps he should go back to doing what WAS real. Such as hanging by his back from hooks, and being suspended hundreds of feet in the air by a helecoptor, and risking serious injury, and or death.That was interesting. I'm not gonna lie.But that's not saying that Season 2 isn't worth owning nor watching, that's only saying that it fails to shock as much as Season 1 did. And where it tries to, it's far too unrealistic to create even a gasp.In one such instance, Criss tried to balance on the sharp points of a gate, and ended up falling onto the said points, and wound up having his chest skewered. While yes, this was cool...there was no blood. Then he even cracked a joke about it. Thus making it entirely unecessary, and somewhat stupid.If people open their eyes, they'll realize that Season 2 tries so hard to be ""believeable"" that it loses alot of what Season 1 had. Believeability. Shock value. And overall, a better episode roster.I don't mean to be the ""bad man"" here, but i'm not going to lie to any of you. Season 2 is somewhat boring compared to Season 1. It's still intersting in many instances, but after watching one episode from each season, a viewer would probably choose the Season 1 episode over the Season 2 episode. Simply because Season 1 was more interesting, shocking, violent, believeable, and noteworthy.Season 2 is good, but somewhat boring. Get it to add to your collection. But don't expect anything really risky, shocking, or bloody, as seen in Season 1.3/5 Stars.Better luck in Season 3, Criss.",3,I'm not gonna lie...,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,3540,"['love', 'Criss', 'Angel.I', 'love', 'what', 'does.He', 'interesting', 'illusionist', 'i', ""'m"", 'fan', 'music', 'well.So', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'review', 'bashing', 'Criss', 'personally.Season', '1', 'was', 'amazing', 'Criss', 'did', 'alot', 'dangerous', 'mind-boggling', 'things', 'One', 'being', 'hanging', 'back', 'hooks', 'helecoptor', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'earth', 'was', 'cool', 'cool', 'thing', 'did', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'being', 'stricken', 'tesla', 'coil', 'nearly', 'being', 'electrocuted', 'death', 'due', 'mishap', 'Then', 'was', 'episode', 'where', 'was', 'put', 'barrel', 'filled', 'water', 'suspended', 'air', 'had', 'escape', 'barrel', 'plummeted', 'ground', 'killed', '.These', 'may', 'seem', 'stunts', 'not', 'illusions', 'were', 'death-defying', 'quite', 'interesting', 'Heck', 'even', 'illusions', 'Season', '1', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Such', 'when', 'Criss', 'cut', 'wrist', 'open', 'pull', 'out', 'initialed', 'quarter', '2', 'however', 'away', 'alot', 'cool', 'looking', 'stunts', 'illusions', 'present', 'more', 'unrealistic', 'even', 'times', 'funny', 'illusions', 'Such', 'pulling', 'woman', 'half', 'was', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'was', 'funny', 'somewhat', 'stupid', 'Then', 'one', 'time', 'Criss', 'was', 'sawn', 'half', 'giant', 'saw', 'blood', 'was', 'apparent', 'entire', 'illusion', 'Thus', 'proving', 'none', 'was', 'real', 'obviously', 'cut', 'anyone', 'half', ""'re"", 'going', 'bleed', 'death.It', 'saddens', 'say', 'Season', '2', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'interesting', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'Call', 'sucker', 'intense', 'bloody', 'illusionry', 'stunts', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'making', 'elephant', 'disappear', 'very', 'interesting', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'countless', 'times', 'Why', 'would', 'wan', 'see', 'Criss', 'do', 'Furthermore', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'Criss', 'had', 'spam', 'phrase', ""'ve"", 'never', 'met', 'correct', 'just', 'screams', 'setup', 'Saying', 'once', 'awhile', 'okay', 'saying', 'nearly', 'single', 'Season', '2', 'episode', 'just', 'begs', 'wan', 'na', 'scream', 'guy.If', 'so', 'bent', 'proving', 'what', 'doing', 'real', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'go', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'WAS', 'real', 'Such', 'hanging', 'back', 'hooks', 'being', 'suspended', 'hundreds', 'feet', 'air', 'helecoptor', 'risking', 'serious', 'injury', 'was', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'lie.But', 'not', 'saying', 'Season', '2', ""n't"", 'worth', 'owning', 'watching', 'only', 'saying', 'shock', 'as', 'much', 'Season', '1', 'did', 'where', 'far', 'too', 'unrealistic', 'create', 'even', 'gasp.In', 'one', 'such', 'instance', 'Criss', 'tried', 'balance', 'sharp', 'points', 'gate', 'ended', 'up', 'falling', 'said', 'points', 'wound', 'up', 'having', 'chest', 'skewered', 'yes', 'was', 'cool', 'was', 'blood', 'Then', 'even', 'cracked', 'joke', 'Thus', 'making', 'entirely', 'unecessary', 'somewhat', 'stupid.If', 'people', 'open', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'realize', 'Season', '2', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'believeable', 'alot', 'what', 'Season', '1', 'had', 'Believeability', 'Shock', 'value', 'overall', 'better', 'episode', 'roster.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'bad', 'man', 'here', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'lie', 'Season', '2', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'compared', 'Season', '1', 'still', 'intersting', 'many', 'instances', 'watching', 'one', 'episode', 'season', 'viewer', 'would', 'probably', 'choose', 'Season', '1', 'episode', 'Season', '2', 'episode', 'Simply', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'more', 'interesting', 'shocking', 'violent', 'believeable', 'noteworthy.Season', '2', 'good', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'Get', 'add', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'really', 'risky', 'shocking', 'bloody', 'seen', 'Season', '1.3/5', 'Stars.Better', 'luck', 'Season', '3', 'Criss']",Criss Angel - Mindfreak - The Complete Season One

938543,AHM15BKYUG77U,B000BB152A,Robert Mandirdik,"[10, 14]","At first when I saw Mindfreak on A&E I thought Criss Angel was the real deal. When I say real deal I mean a REAL magician. His levitation and building walk gigs totally got me. I thought for weeks trying to figure out how any human would be able to defy gravity to that extent. After, convinced he's the ""real deal"" I purchased his Mindfreak DVD and watched all the episodes. (I was disappointed to find that the ""bullet catch"" was not on it). Regardless, almost all the episodes are on it. OK, now this is where the BUT comes in. After you watch magic over and over again, you start to see things that you didn't see the first time. When Criss always says, ""one continuous shot, don't cut"" all he's doing IS cutting in the editing room. Criss writes, produces, and directs the entire series. So after I signed on to his website, and saw that he was actually selling the secret of levitation for $100 on DVD! Without hesitating i purchased it, and once the DVD arrived and I popped it in, I couldn't help but laugh my butt off! Very cheazy, but it does give the illusion. And if you think you'll be able to float 5 - 10 feet, don't get your hopes up like I did. All he teaches you is how to float a foot at most and its extremely angle sensitive, meaning your spectator(s) have to be right behind you. Not what I was hoping for at all. I also purchased the ""Quarter through soda can"" trick for $30 and that was 100% worth it. Fantastic illusion. I have fooled a lot of people with that one. Criss, if your reading this reveal your 5-10 foot levitations without shoes!!! Or how bout the building walk!?! If you put either of those on the market for $1000 (one thousand) then you got a deal, lol. Now that's one that still boggles my mind, if of course he's being honest and there are no special strings etc. Hard to trust a magician, lol. I wonder why you open the umbrella while turning. At one point I was so obsessed that he's real, that I attended his DVD signing at Virgin Megastore in Hollywood. After 3 hours of waiting it was finally mine and my friends turn. He was very nice and all, but when I asked him to do something with a quarter, all he did was a slide of hand my grandmother can do! There are a lot of more bloopers that are hard to spot on the Mindfreak DVD that I don't want to mention, because it'll take too long, but with these last words... Criss Angel is a master illusionist, not a magician. I give him 8 out of 10.

Angel is one of the new breed of magicians/illusionists who have said forget the stage and the beautiful assistant in skimpy outfits and who has taken his act to the street to perform tricks both mind-boggling and dangerous.  One has to question the sanity of a guy who sets himself ablaze on his mother's birthday but that's just what Criss does.His feats of sleight of hand and illusion make for great TV.  Is it all camera tricks?  Are all the people paid shills and plants there to oooohhh and ahhhh?  I don't know and it really doesn't matter to me.  Seein him levitate himself three feet in the air onto a chair in front of a casino lounge full of guests is pretty damn amazing no matter how its done.  What makes Angel so intriguiing to me is his showmanship.  The greatest magicians are those that have showmanship and flair.  Even the greatest tricks can be dull in the hands of a bland performer.  Angel is anything but bland displaying a likeability that anyone who encounters him certainly feels.
