I put it on when I was ready to go to bed - sleepy and worn out from the day - and now here it is two hours later and I watched whole thing.  After it started, I couldn't turn if off.The movie is gripping.  The dialogue is simple and sparse, but the drama is intense.  Danielle Panabaker is very convincing in the movie.  She portrays the emotions in a vivid but mysterious way.  She also does so in a very reserved fashion, like a volcano that is about to erupt -- but never does.  It doesn't have to -- the power is there.  The fact that she's gorgeous doesn't make it difficult to watch either.The ending is unusual.  Simple, but unusual.  I found myself wanting more as the movie ends somewhat suspended, but resolved at the same time.  It's quite an interesting combination of tension and resolution that seems to co-exist rather comfortably.  I call it masterful.Overall, I recommend the movie to anyone who wants a movie that leaves you pleased and inspired, but also wanting more.",5,Understated Movie leaves you wanting more,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",2013,1026,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'put', 'when', 'was', 'ready', 'go', 'bed', 'sleepy', 'worn', 'out', 'day', 'now', 'here', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'started', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'off.The', 'movie', 'gripping', 'dialogue', 'simple', 'sparse', 'drama', 'intense', 'Danielle', 'Panabaker', 'very', 'convincing', 'movie', 'emotions', 'vivid', 'mysterious', 'way', 'also', 'so', 'very', 'reserved', 'fashion', 'volcano', 'erupt', 'never', ""n't"", 'have', 'power', 'there', 'fact', 'gorgeous', ""n't"", 'make', 'difficult', 'watch', 'either.The', 'ending', 'unusual', 'Simple', 'unusual', 'found', 'wanting', 'more', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'suspended', 'resolved', 'same', 'time', 'quite', 'interesting', 'combination', 'tension', 'resolution', 'co-exist', 'rather', 'comfortably', 'call', 'masterful.Overall', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'movie', 'pleased', 'inspired', 'also', 'wanting', 'more']",Beverly Lewis' the Shunning

Be shunned is such a horrible thing that it really was just so shocking how that is done and to be honest not sure if I still do. This movie brought out so many feelings and tears.

1445067,A16Z2OECAUX8Z4,B00584A7MY,Ashley Mott,"[2, 3]","I went into this film having read ""The Shunning"" in the past, but it was so long ago that a lot of the details were a little bit fuzzy in my mind. Because of this, I believe I can conclusively state that both fans of the book and people who have never read the books will be able to enjoy this movie.For book fans:I believe that this follows the book pretty well. While some aspects are added to make it more film-worthy, the basic plot of Katie having been given to an Amish family by her mother remains the same. Nothing sensational is added to the film. It is definitely as family friendly for viewing as Beverly Lewis' books are for reading.For all potential viewers:This movie had a truly superb cast and crew. None of the Amish characters or home life depictions felt forced or phony. Danielle Panabaker was the most perfect Katie you could hope for. Her expressions and delicate beauty really made you feel her pain in the sad moments, her confusion when she was lost and her happiness when she flashes back to prior times.There are no annoying pans and zooms with the camera, no artsy editing effects and no cheesy dialogue. When you watch a lot of family friendly films, you encounter all of these elements from time to time in the lower budget movies that aren't produced by conscientious film makers. You will encounter none of that here. ""The Shunning"" is every bit as good as any other Michael Landon Jr. project I have been fortunate enough to watch (or read!).The scenery is lovely and the set dressing is realistic looking to my non-Amish eyes.

I know it's based after a book written by a wonderful author, but the movie was kind of dry and it left me wanting a bit more to it. But it was a made for TV movie too so that might have been a bit of the problem too.I do want to say the acting was amazing and I loved that they tried their best to stay authentic to Amish culture. Where we live it's a lot of Mennonite culture, even at Walmart there is Horse parking. So having the movie stick closely to what I've experienced, with the exception that the Mennonite interact with the ""English"". They even went as far as to have an accent.I did enjoy parts of the movie and learning more about what its like to be part of a Shunning, both on the outcast side and the other people's side. I know I wouldn't be able to survive not being talked to or not talking to the ones I loved.If they came out with a sequel to the movie I would watch it. Mainly because I did fall in love with the characters and want to see more of what happens in Katie's life, what happens when she meets her birth mother, can she go back to her adoptive family?So maybe if it wasn't a made for TV movie they could have built up the characters and plot line a bit more and made the movie a bit more exciting. But with what I saw, I really want to see more. maybe I will even go and read these books too.It's a cute movie and I'm sure most will love it and want more. Beverly Lewis fans will love it too.---------------------------------------------------""Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

""The Shunning"" is an excellent and for the most part accurate portrayal of Amish life as it really is. All the major characters are believable. And the story itself is fast-moving, gripping, and heartwarming. (The one little quibble I have is that it is possible to take away from the story that marriages in the Amish community are arranged or practically arranged, as Katie's [Danielle Panabaker] proposed marriage seems to be. Based on the research I have done, I do not believe that this is typically the case.)Unlike some reviewers, who have stated that the ending leaves us hanging, I found the scene at the bus stop, when Katie is on her way to search for her birth mother, to be a perfect way to bring the story to a close. This story is primarily about Katie and her relationship with the adoptive family that has raised her since infancy, and in particular the break (and resultant shunning) that takes place when she finds out the secret her family has hidden from her all these years. The story is not about whether or not she reconnects with her birth mom. The fact that we never find this out is not relevant. Whether or not the rift with her family (particularly her father) is healed is what is crucial.

A made-for-TV movie with a Christian slant--though nothing that's just preachily in-yer-face--it is, of course, totally clean: No sex, serious violence, or even a single mild curse word. Still, this film is very much in the real world and gives an intriguing view of Amish life. Danielle Panabaker gives a memorable performance as Katie Lapp; ditto for those who play the various other Amish characters. Professionally done filming that provides some excellent scenery of the Pennsylvania Dutch countryside. The flashbacks to Katie with her childhood friend and would-be husband Daniel are quite arresting. THE SHUNNING is an interesting, moving, and poignant experience.NOTE: I'm not religious in the formal, traditional sense, and I read and watch a lot of gritty, gross, nasty stuff.

1445084,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B00584A7MY,G. Teslovich,"[9, 14]","Speaking from experience of having taught in two somewhat isolated religion affiliated communities similar to what was portrayed I take issue with several portrayals. First, the characterizations of everyday behavior were far too safely middle of the road stereotypic mythical creations. The reality, as I've seen, is that you have a greater range with both a more liberal acceptance of the outside world but also an even more restrictive control resulting in even less contact with the outside world e.g. playing touch football is OK but looking at a magazine in a grocery store is not. Second, the dialogue was too stereotypically artificial - what an outsider who has watched too many sect movies would be likely to write. Third, the casting just didn't fit especially Katie - didn't look the part, act the part and seemed coached for the dialogue.

The only way to get a complete book-to-film adaptation is via a series. 90 min of film requires only 50 novel pages. Thus the film is not identical but ""based on"" and I'll review the DVD--it's as gripping as the book. Beverly Lewis admits the stories are different, but both good, and Katie Lapp was based on Lewis' ancestor.How can a young beautiful girl who lusts for songs and guitar music marry an Amish Bishop? Is music from the heart to please God? So many conflicts between the English & Amish ways to face. Katie discovers a family secret prior to her nuptials and sets out to sample the English city ""sin-style"". She makes a larger decision that shames family and she ultimately is shunned. Shunning is a ban on association with a fallen member of the Amish faith. A most severe discipline; as the church members see her turning from the faith.Absolutely beautiful country scenic film; with rural NC playing the set of Hickory Hollow, Lancaster Co. Eye-catching Danielle Panabaker (Katie) & Sandra W. Van Natta (Mom) are excellent in playing these two emotional roles.This beautiful setting host any human struggle of opposites. Politics, race, gender, rich/poor, generational, conflicts are not unlike that of the movie ""The Help"" (you must see it). In ""The Shunning"" it happens to be a chosen way of non-worldly lifestyle that creates conflict. ""The Shunning"" is associated with AFFIRMfilms who also connect with the Christian film hit ""Courageous."" Another must see!DVD does have SDH subtitles.

She doesn't want to disappoint her family about her love of music but she also wants to be who God made her to be. She is engaged to marry Bishop John but is unsure if she can be the kind of wife he wants her to be. An unexpected English person comes into the Lapp's lives which causes turmoil in their family because they have to dig up a deep family secret that has been buried for many years.This film has a lot of special themes and I believe that one can only get the full benefit by watching the whole film. With the title ""The Shunning"" a person can probably guess that one of the themes is ""being shunned"" and this film gives a person a better understanding about what an Amish person, or any person who doesn't belong to certain religion may feel when they are not included in their lives because they are not from the same religion as they are. The unpeacefulness one has in their soul because they are trying to be pulled away from who God wants them to be is something also deeply expressed through this film.I recommend this film to anybody that likes Amish fiction, especially if they have been reading a lot of Amish fiction books for awhile and want to see what they have been imagining come to life a little bit more through the big screen. This is the first Amish film I can remember watching and it was helpful to me to watch it after I had gotten used to some of the Amish language I have learned from novels, otherwise I might have not connected as well to it.

Directed by Micheal Landon Jr, The Shunning was adapted from Beverly Lewis' bestseller. While I did enjoy the movie, the ending left a lot to be desired. I know the book The Shunning is the first in a three-part series, so I can only conclude (and hope) that they plan to adapt the rest of the books to film.Katie Lapp is the heroine of the movie. She's 20, loves playing the guitar (which is forbidden by The Order), loves to sing (also forbidden), and has her misgivings about her upcoming nuptials to widower John, the new bishop. Danielle Panabaker played a very vivacious and endearing Katie, in my opinion. All the actors in the movie did wonderfully well, though I thought it was kind of humorous to see all the makeup the Amish actors wore. :-P Something tells me the real Katie Lapp wouldn't have gloss on her lips or heavy liner and mascara on her eyes.The history between Katie and Daniel seemed interesting, though in this adaptation it seemed like we got only the tip of the iceberg. The whole movie was very well put together and the peak into what a ""shunning"" really means for an Amish person was interesting. A very hard, still, and severe punishment, in my opinion. (I would not make a good Amish person! ;-)So while I enjoyed the movie, the ending was really abrupt and left so many unanswered questions. When the credits started rolling, I felt like the actual storyplot was just getting started! Here Katie Lapp was, just found out she was adopted, leaving her family behind to go into the world and discover who she really is....and the movie ends.

They definitely read as cliffhangers and those going into this movie should realize that this movie only covers the first book, so it does have a cliffhanger.  I would suspect that they are also making movies for the other two books to remedy that.Katie Lapp has always struggled with her faith.  After the death of her boyfriend three years ago, it's hard for her to relate to other people within the community.  Her love of music and the guitar especially hinder this which makes things worse because she is betrothed to the bishop, and such transgressions are not easily forgiven.  So when a strange English woman comes around asking questions, it disrupts things even further as Katie learns the secret about her past, and whether or not staying in the community is the proper thing for her to do.Characters:Danielle Panabaker: Katie LappBill Oberst Jr. - Katie's fatherSherry Stringfield - Laura Mayfield-BennettSandra Van Netta - Katie's motherDavid Topp - Daniel FisherOk, so the first thing I had an issue with was the amount of makeup worn by the Amish characters in this movie.  Katie had eye liner, eye shadow, and lip gloss through the whole thing!  Which I can tell you right now isn't authentic.  Even her mom seemed to be sporting a little eye makeup.  If you're going to make a movie about the Amish, their looks should be portrayed correctly.  The actors did an ok job aside from that, but I think Katie could have been better cast.  Panabaker just didn't act like an Amish woman (and while I don't have huge experience with the Amish, I do sometimes drive them home and interact with them, so I do have a little experience to base my thoughts off of).  Even an Amish woman struggling with her faith wouldn't do some of the things that Katie did.  By contrast, I thought that Oberst did a wonderful job as Katie's father.  He was stern yet loving and most of the scenes involving him were the ones that I teared up at.  The other character were average in their performances and once again, didn't really ring authentic for me.  Although it was nice to see Stringfield, I haven't seen her in anything since her role on E.R.There were quite a few inaccuracies in this movie, first and foremost the makeup.  I also thought the accents were a little bit overdone.  Now I'm accustomed to Ohio Amish accents, but they aren't near as heavy as those used in the movie.  But I'm willing to grant that perhaps the Pennsylvania Amish accent is heavier, although I suspect not as heavy as in this movie.  The plot itself more or less followed the book, and I didn't see anything that I would want to call out as being completely a detour from the book.  There wasn't as much religion in focus as there are in the books which was the only noticeable difference that I found.  There were a few scenes that made me tear up, it is an emotional story about a girl just trying to find out where she belongs.

Her love of music and playing the guitar is something she promised she gave up until her brother finds her playing it one day in the loft above the barn and reminds her, what her father will do if he finds out. Katie believes that there is something to this gift of music that God gave her.What connection does this woman have to her life...and how will the unraveling secrets challenge Katie's faith? Beverly Lewis' The Shunning is a powerful, personal journey of discovery based on the famous novel by New York Times best-selling author. The film is based on the celebrated first novel of the best-selling ""The Heritage of Lancaster County"" book series.Beverly Lewis, born in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, is the New York Times bestselling author of more than eighty books. Her stories have been published in eleven languages worldwide. A keen interest in her mother's Plain heritage has inspired Lewis to write many Amish-related novels, beginning with ""The Shunning,"" which has sold more than one million copies. In 2007, Lewis' ""The Brethren"" was honored with a Christy Award.I received The Shunning by Beverly Lewis on DVD compliments of Propeller and the Hallmark Channel for my honest review and LOVED this one. Being a huge fan of Amish fiction and their simple way of life, I was captivated to see how this storyline would play out. I felt for Katie's desire to please her family but also the struggle of what she believes God would want her to use her gift of music for. This is a perfect story that shows the simplicity of the Amish lives and how their faith plays a huge role in what they do and believe. Hands down this is a perfect movie for the entire family and rates a 5 out of 5 stars.
