Yeah it is absurd in some ways and the story is somewhat predictable, if you like the &#34;Smoky and the Bandit&#34; style you will like this.  It stars Patrick Swayze as a tough convict who kidnapps his own kids from a dasterdly Foster Care Center in rout to &#34;The Big Final Score&#34; and then the mayhem begins.  Also in the cast is a young Halle Berry as a newspaper writer trying to help Swayze, Sabrina Lloyd (Sliders), and Brian Bonsell (Whose The Boss) as the unrully kids.  There is plenty of car chases, twists and turns, and laughs as this old school cross country chase movie from 1993.",4,Still Funny After All These Years,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,650,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'get', 'kick', 'movie', 'Yeah', 'absurd', 'ways', 'story', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'like', '34', 'Smoky', 'Bandit', '34', 'style', 'will', 'like', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'tough', 'convict', 'who', 'own', 'kids', 'dasterdly', 'Foster', 'Care', 'Center', 'rout', '34', 'Big', 'Final', 'Score', '34', 'then', 'mayhem', 'Also', 'cast', 'young', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'newspaper', 'writer', 'trying', 'help', 'Swayze', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Sliders', 'Brian', 'Bonsell', 'Whose', 'Boss', 'unrully', 'kids', 'plenty', 'car', 'chases', 'twists', 'turns', 'old', 'school', 'cross', 'country', 'chase', 'movie', '1993']",Father Hood

She recounts the horrors she encountered at Bigelow Hall, an orphanage run by a corrupt official. Jack tells her he won't do anything making her beg to at least try to get custody of her brother so she and him can escape, the court denies the petition and she convinces him to watch the compound to discover his daughter was telling the truth. Enraged Jack takes the bus, frees his son and a pregnant girl making the warden swallow the key. He takes them to Las Vegas where his mother lives only to learn she has no intrest in raising his children, and they leave. Meanwhile on their way to New Orleans Jack is forced to learn things about his children, such as their hardships, hopes, ambitions, heart-breaks, and dreams. He also learns why the warden wants his daughter back, because she could get him locked up for child molestation. In the end he learns that no matter what he's about, no matter what he says or does they are still his children and he's still their father.

Interesting premise: 2 kids in foster care/reform school (?) break out to find real dad (Patrick Swayze) to take them across the country to New Orleans.  Real dad turns out to be a con artist one step ahead of the law and some bad guys.  Movie then disintegrates into bad chase movie punctuated by dysfunctional family squabbling as dad doesn't really want anything to do with kids.  Meanwhile there's a plot about abuses going on at the state children's facility and a reporter (Halle Berry) who's doing an investigation, and covering their cross-country flight (which has been labeled a kidnapping).  Much confusion later, kids eventually reunite with Dad.  Crappy dialogue abounds, and Swayze chews up the scenery as an over-the-hill rocker/con man suddenly saddled with a teenage daughter and a younger son.  Josh Lucas has a cameo role (one of his first movies) as the daughter's object of affection; he plays a college intern who befriended her at the facility and she mistakenly confuses his friendship with love, and he just happens to live in New Orleans...so this is really why the girl wants to go there.  Sabrina Lloyd of Sliders plays the girl, but I can't remember any of the characters' names; that should tell you something.",3,"interesting premise, horrible execution",1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,1267,"['Ah', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Interesting', 'premise', '2', 'kids', 'foster', 'care/reform', 'school', 'break', 'find', 'real', 'dad', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'take', 'country', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Real', 'dad', 'out', 'be', 'con', 'artist', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'law', 'bad', 'guys', 'Movie', 'then', 'bad', 'chase', 'movie', 'punctuated', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'squabbling', 'dad', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'anything', 'do', 'kids', 'Meanwhile', 'plot', 'abuses', 'going', 'state', 'children', 'facility', 'reporter', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'who', 'doing', 'investigation', 'covering', 'cross-country', 'flight', 'been', 'labeled', 'kidnapping', 'Much', 'confusion', 'later', 'kids', 'eventually', 'reunite', 'Dad', 'Crappy', 'dialogue', 'abounds', 'Swayze', 'up', 'scenery', 'over-the-hill', 'rocker/con', 'man', 'suddenly', 'saddled', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'younger', 'son', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'cameo', 'role', 'one', 'first', 'movies', 'daughter', 'object', 'affection', 'college', 'intern', 'who', 'befriended', 'facility', 'mistakenly', 'friendship', 'love', 'just', 'live', 'New', 'Orleans', 'so', 'really', 'why', 'girl', 'go', 'there', 'Sabrina', 'Lloyd', 'Sliders', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'characters', 'names', 'should', 'tell', 'something']",Father Hood
