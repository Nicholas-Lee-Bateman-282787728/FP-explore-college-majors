1493538,A2O8K7L29RLY54,B005LLXB9K,"E. Kutinsky ""ekutinsky""","[2, 2]","Here's some things I learned about Pearl Jam in Cameron Crowe's Pearl Jam Twenty, despite Pearl Jam being a band I thought (just by growing up in the 90s revering alternative music) I knew everything about: That Jeff Ament identifies with the LA Clippers, that the story of ""Alive"" is basically true because Eddie Vedder's father did die when he was 13 without Vedder knowing him, that Vedder had a penchant for climbing scaffolding in the early 90s, that Neil Young wanted to call Kurt Cobain a week before his death to tell him to take time off, that ""Ten"" the album was named after the number on Mookie Blaylock's jersey (because, of course, Mookie Blaylock was Pearl Jam's first name).  Crowe does such an extraordinary job recapturing what music was like leading up to Grunge's explosion in the early 1990s that not only do you learn to re-love its innocence, you learn - as Chris Cornell tells you early on - that those involved in the scene already disliked it even before anyone paid attention. Early on you see Andy Wood, the doomed tragic almost-rock star of Mother Love Bone, the proto-Pearl Jam, confess into a camera he'd even open for Warrant (!) if he had to.  A moment like that (it not only forces you to remember who Warrant is, but why someone would dislike them) shows you the innocence of a movement it wasn't even aware it could possess.That's because Pearl Jam Twenty is a movie that in its singular love of a time bypasses any irony and lets you experience what seeing that music for the first time was like; in a way it's the first movie to treat music of the last 25 years with the same mythology of the rock music of the 70s. Pearl Jam, by surviving, get to present a surprisingly moving history of managing the modern rock business by, basically, doing what they felt like they were supposed to do.  You see the band's surprise at being famous and their unease about it in ways that, although sometimes speedily worked through, present what must be as accurate a portrait ever filmed of rock music in the 1990s, a time that people like me like to think of as important in music.  I could quibble with the movie's rushed we-love-the-fans recount of the band's love of switching up their playlist that help fill up the final fifteen minutes of the movie.  But scenes like that go a long way to sketching the details of what it's like to be a survivor of a genuine moment in music history.  By the end, you feel proud to have lived through it with a band who, truly, managed to always be themselves.",5,Still alive...,1327795200,"01 29, 2012",2012,2524,"['Here', 'things', 'learned', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Twenty', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'being', 'band', 'thought', 'just', 'growing', 'up', '90s', 'revering', 'alternative', 'music', 'knew', 'everything', 'Jeff', 'Ament', 'identifies', 'LA', 'Clippers', 'story', 'Alive', 'basically', 'true', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'father', 'did', 'die', 'when', 'was', '13', 'Vedder', 'knowing', 'Vedder', 'had', 'penchant', 'climbing', 'scaffolding', 'early', '90s', 'Neil', 'Young', 'wanted', 'call', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'week', 'death', 'tell', 'take', 'time', 'off', 'Ten', 'album', 'was', 'named', 'number', 'Mookie', 'Blaylock', 'jersey', 'course', 'Mookie', 'Blaylock', 'was', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'first', 'name', 'Crowe', 'extraordinary', 'job', 'recapturing', 'what', 'music', 'was', 'leading', 'up', 'Grunge', 'explosion', 'early', '1990s', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'learn', 're-love', 'innocence', 'learn', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'early', 'involved', 'scene', 'already', 'disliked', 'even', 'anyone', 'paid', 'attention', 'Early', 'see', 'Andy', 'Wood', 'doomed', 'tragic', 'almost-rock', 'star', 'Mother', 'Love', 'Bone', 'proto-Pearl', 'Jam', 'confess', 'camera', ""'d"", 'even', 'open', 'Warrant', 'had', 'moment', 'not', 'only', 'remember', 'who', 'Warrant', 'why', 'someone', 'would', 'dislike', 'innocence', 'movement', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', 'could', 'possess.That', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Twenty', 'movie', 'singular', 'love', 'time', 'irony', 'experience', 'what', 'seeing', 'music', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'way', 'first', 'movie', 'treat', 'music', 'last', '25', 'years', 'same', 'mythology', 'rock', 'music', '70s', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'surviving', 'get', 'present', 'surprisingly', 'moving', 'history', 'managing', 'modern', 'rock', 'business', 'basically', 'doing', 'what', 'felt', 'were', 'supposed', 'do', 'see', 'band', 'surprise', 'being', 'famous', 'unease', 'ways', 'sometimes', 'speedily', 'worked', 'present', 'what', 'must', 'be', 'accurate', 'portrait', 'ever', 'filmed', 'rock', 'music', '1990s', 'time', 'people', 'think', 'as', 'important', 'music', 'could', 'quibble', 'movie', 'rushed', 'we-love-the-fans', 'recount', 'band', 'love', 'switching', 'up', 'playlist', 'help', 'fill', 'up', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'scenes', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'sketching', 'details', 'what', 'be', 'survivor', 'genuine', 'moment', 'music', 'history', 'end', 'feel', 'proud', 'have', 'lived', 'band', 'who', 'truly', 'managed', 'always', 'be']",Pearl Jam Twenty

1493541,A1SHIUVOIHSZJO,B005LLXB9K,"Jason A. Kentros ""SharkByte""","[0, 0]","I think it goes without saying that this is a must-have film for Pearl Jam fans, especially those who want to learn more about their history and get a more behind-the-scenes look at the interaction between them.  Cameron Crowe is a phenomenal filmmaker and obviously a huge fan of music, as his film &#34;Singles&#34; was heavily focused on the Seattle music scene that begain to dominate in the early 90's.The early parts of the film are focused on the death of Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood, and how his death affected the community.  Cameron included a lot of very early footage from those days, mixed with new interview pieces to provide a thorough backstory to the origin of Pearl Jam.  From there, it shifts into telling how they acquired singer Eddie Vedder and his integration into the band and the Seattle community.  I see this film as more of a character study than a simple timeline-based story of the band from its creation to current state.  The Foo Fighters released a documentary called &#34;Back And Forth&#34; which was similar in regards to showing how the band was formed but then closely followed what was going on within the band as each album was released.  I would have liked to see more of that in Pearl Jam Twenty, but there were some poignant moments that I did appreciate, such as Cameron sharing the actual &#34;Momma-Son&#34; demo cassette that Eddie recorded his vocals on, and Stone visiting his old apartment where he and Jeff first listened to the demo.  For PJ &#34;nerds&#34; this kind of footage is like gold simply for its nostalgic value.Even as closely as I've followed the band, I learned a lot about their early days from watching this, especially in regards to their relationship with Chris Cornell and how he was a bit of a mentor for Eddie when first arriving in Seattle.  It's a great film for PJ fans, probably not enough to turn non-fans but a great wealth of knowledge and footage for those interested enough to know more.",4,A great in-depth look at the history of Pearl Jam,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,1977,"['think', 'saying', 'must-have', 'film', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'fans', 'especially', 'who', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'history', 'get', 'more', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'interaction', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'phenomenal', 'filmmaker', 'obviously', 'huge', 'fan', 'music', 'film', '34', 'Singles', '34', 'was', 'heavily', 'focused', 'Seattle', 'music', 'scene', 'dominate', 'early', ""90's.The"", 'early', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'focused', 'death', 'Mother', 'Love', 'Bone', 'singer', 'Andrew', 'Wood', 'how', 'death', 'affected', 'community', 'Cameron', 'included', 'lot', 'very', 'early', 'footage', 'days', 'mixed', 'new', 'interview', 'pieces', 'provide', 'thorough', 'backstory', 'origin', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'there', 'telling', 'how', 'acquired', 'singer', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'integration', 'band', 'Seattle', 'community', 'see', 'film', 'more', 'character', 'study', 'simple', 'timeline-based', 'story', 'band', 'creation', 'current', 'state', 'Foo', 'Fighters', 'released', 'documentary', 'called', '34', 'Back', 'Forth', '34', 'was', 'similar', 'regards', 'showing', 'how', 'band', 'was', 'formed', 'then', 'closely', 'followed', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'band', 'album', 'was', 'released', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'Twenty', 'were', 'poignant', 'moments', 'did', 'appreciate', 'such', 'Cameron', 'sharing', 'actual', '34', 'Momma-Son', '34', 'demo', 'cassette', 'Eddie', 'recorded', 'vocals', 'Stone', 'visiting', 'old', 'apartment', 'where', 'Jeff', 'first', 'listened', 'demo', 'PJ', '34', 'nerds', '34', 'kind', 'footage', 'gold', 'simply', 'nostalgic', 'value.Even', 'as', 'closely', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'band', 'learned', 'lot', 'early', 'days', 'watching', 'especially', 'regards', 'relationship', 'Chris', 'Cornell', 'how', 'was', 'bit', 'mentor', 'Eddie', 'when', 'first', 'arriving', 'Seattle', 'great', 'film', 'PJ', 'fans', 'probably', 'not', 'enough', 'turn', 'non-fans', 'great', 'wealth', 'knowledge', 'footage', 'interested', 'enough', 'know', 'more']",Pearl Jam Twenty

Then this last summer I got to see them both again. I saw pearl Jam at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto during the Toronto Film Festival where they premiered this film. The film is really good for someone like me just getting back into the band there was a lot I did not know or had forgotten so it was really interesting to watch. They had great interveiws with the band and Chris Cornelle from Soundgarden. It starts of with some great video of Mother Love bone which I had never scene before. It also had some Temple Of The Dog live video. Lots of great clips of Pearl Jam live (since they have so much live film and video I really hope they make a set like kiss did where you get multiple shows in one package) and great interveiw clips from throughout their carreer. However I do feel Pearl Jam must of had final say on the film because certain things get mentioned in passing (like drug problems) and very little of the internal struggles are talked about or expanded on.I don't know how great this film would be for die hards. If you know the Band's history there won't be much here. Although the Grammy segment is classic. My only major complaint is the lack of bonus materiel. If you bought this from their web site you got four hours of bonus material. I am getting tired of the practice where you have to by things from certain sites to get bonus material. I know you are saying ""just go to their website"". Well in this case they are sold out and sometime it's not the Band's web site you have to go to. With Yes's Union DVD/CD you had to go to the web site of the company making the package. I also feel it punishes people who get into the group later on. I also know in my case it has discouraged me from getting into a group that I can't get all the product I want from. I did eventually buy their CD's but this happened when I got back into Iron Maiden because I could no longer buy their cd's with the bonus b-sides disc's. It has also stopped me from picking up their other albums because of the CD reissues they have started and you get bonus stuff when ordered from their site.So over all!

The film is great dont get me wrong, but i think for the average fan not so much for the die hards. I know i am going to get pounded for this review but here it goesThroughout the film great never before seen footage, interviews and snippets of live performances. 2 clips they played from Nassau and Philly i was there so that was great. The Film had me teary and had the chills throughout but its lacking in some areas. 1) Crowe and PJ go thru the whole history of the band, each member how they got there etc but they some how skip over very quickly the revolving drummers they have had over the years it is played off like a joke and very quickly, as much as Matt Cameron is great he is only a small piece of the bands history. 2) I was shocked to see more dedicated film time to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain then i was to see Alice in chains and Layne Staley ??? according to what has been written and said Eddie and PJ were very close to Layne (ala Mad season etc) 3) The film mentions every band known to man like Mookie blaylock, Green River and Mount Tre etc but no mention of Bad Radio? and other Eddie Vedder early bands.4) Very brief in the bands influences and what bands they appreicate it. Yes Neil Young and the Who and Hendrix are mentioned but not so much updated artists 5) The film could have been longer, it feel a little rushed and feels a little skippy, jumping from piece to piece. 6) The movie is written and directed in i would say a ""Fans Perspective"" not many hard questions asked.I was super excited for this Film and did my own campaining getting everyone i know to go see itBy no means am i a critic but i am a fan and have watched enough Documentaries to see what i think was missing",4,Good but could have been alot more,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",2011,2179,"['couple', 'days', 'i', 'watched', 'PJ20', 'Filmon', 'PBS', 'granted', 'was', 'edited', 'Language', 'i', 'am', 'imagining', 'bonus', 'footage', 'was', 'same', 'film', 'i', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'dvd', 'collectionAs', 'i', 'sit', 'here', 'listen', 'PJ20', 'soundtrack', 'couple', 'gripes', 'film', 'Now', 'coming', 'die', 'hard', 'PJ', 'Fan', 'not', 'hard', 'be', 'objective', 'greatest', 'band', 'earth', 'i', 'think', 'gripe', 'more', 'Cameron', 'Crowe', 'PJ', 'had', 'alot', 'do', 'film', 'film', 'great', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'i', 'think', 'average', 'fan', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'die', 'hards', 'know', 'i', 'am', 'going', 'get', 'pounded', 'review', 'here', 'film', 'great', 'never', 'seen', 'footage', 'interviews', 'snippets', 'live', 'performances', '2', 'clips', 'played', 'Nassau', 'Philly', 'i', 'was', 'there', 'so', 'was', 'great', 'Film', 'had', 'teary', 'had', 'chills', 'lacking', 'areas', '1', 'Crowe', 'PJ', 'go', 'whole', 'history', 'band', 'member', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'etc', 'how', 'skip', 'very', 'quickly', 'revolving', 'drummers', 'have', 'had', 'years', 'played', 'off', 'joke', 'very', 'quickly', 'as', 'much', 'Matt', 'Cameron', 'great', 'only', 'small', 'piece', 'bands', 'history', '2', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'more', 'dedicated', 'film', 'time', 'Nirvana', 'Kurt', 'Cobain', 'then', 'i', 'was', 'see', 'Alice', 'chains', 'Layne', 'Staley', 'according', 'what', 'been', 'written', 'said', 'Eddie', 'PJ', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'Layne', 'ala', 'Mad', 'season', 'etc', '3', 'film', 'mentions', 'band', 'known', 'man', 'Mookie', 'blaylock', 'Green', 'River', 'Mount', 'Tre', 'etc', 'mention', 'Bad', 'Radio', 'other', 'Eddie', 'Vedder', 'early', 'bands.4', 'Very', 'brief', 'bands', 'influences', 'what', 'appreicate', 'Yes', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Who', 'Hendrix', 'are', 'mentioned', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'updated', 'artists', '5', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'feel', 'little', 'rushed', 'little', 'skippy', 'jumping', 'piece', 'piece', '6', 'movie', 'written', 'directed', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'Fans', 'Perspective', 'not', 'many', 'hard', 'questions', 'asked.I', 'was', 'super', 'excited', 'Film', 'did', 'own', 'campaining', 'getting', 'everyone', 'i', 'know', 'go', 'see', 'itBy', 'am', 'i', 'critic', 'i', 'am', 'fan', 'have', 'watched', 'enough', 'Documentaries', 'see', 'what', 'i', 'think', 'was', 'missing']",Pearl Jam Twenty

I remember the grunge scene coming of age.  The hair bands suddenly looked really stupid.  The movie recaps a solid 20 year run for a great band.  I have not played the soundtrack yet, all good things in time.  I liked how they gave a soild history to the band, no sugar coated turds here, just the real deal.  Vedder's comments at the Grammys surprised me.  They should have not even gone if it meant nothing to them.  Besides that, it was a great look back a super talented band.",5,A great look back to yesterdays memories,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,572,"['really', 'liked', 'movie', 'took', 'back', 'early', '20', 'wilder', 'years', 'remember', 'grunge', 'scene', 'coming', 'age', 'hair', 'suddenly', 'looked', 'really', 'stupid', 'movie', 'solid', '20', 'year', 'run', 'great', 'band', 'have', 'not', 'played', 'soundtrack', 'yet', 'good', 'things', 'time', 'liked', 'how', 'gave', 'soild', 'history', 'band', 'sugar', 'coated', 'turds', 'here', 'just', 'real', 'deal', 'Vedder', 'comments', 'Grammys', 'surprised', 'should', 'have', 'not', 'even', 'gone', 'meant', 'nothing', 'was', 'great', 'look', 'back', 'super', 'talented', 'band']",Pearl Jam Twenty
