Jaclyn Smith looks as good as I remember her and plays her part too.  The story is good - a bit hoakey also.

Like with most Santa Claus movies, you must suspend your disbelief, but this one really stretches the fantasy.  Santa  Claus tries to explain how he performs all his &quot;miracles&quot; by  using modern scientific techniques.  He even has an R &amp; D Department at  &quot;North Pole City.&quot;  He uses Einstein's theories to slow time.  He  doesn't go down chimneys any more; he uses a &quot;people  transporter.&quot;  Yet he doesn't come up with any scientific explanation  as to how he got to be so old.  Instead of making up pseudo-scientific  explanations for Santa, it would be a much better movie if they simply let  him rely on his magic.  Also, though I might be getting picky, the story  takes place at a town located above the Arctic Circle in December.  It  should be night there all the time.

This movie has a great cast of chracters and is sure to get you into the holiday spirit and it will remind you how important Christmas really is.As we start out, we meet Mr. Baldwin, a professional oil rigger who has been dynamiting ice fields near the north pole. This smells trouble for Santa and the elves. So Mr. Balwdin and his wife Claudia go home and there we meet his kids, David(oldest), Marianne (middle), and C.B. (youngest). David is basically a good kid that is sort of a suck-up to his parents. Marianne is an average yound girl with a heart of gold. Their youngest son C.B. is a trouble maker. He's always getting into fights with bullies who parade around saying, ""There's NO Santa Claus."" So C.B. is having trouble getting into the holiday spirit.The next day Mr. Baldwin meets Santa's chief elf named Ed. He warns Mr. Balwdin that he has to stop the dynamiting because he will eventually blow up the North Pole. He breaks out in laughter and doesn't believe any of this. So Mr. Baldwin goes home and relays this whole story to his family and everyone laughs except C.B. because he's the only one that believes it.The next day when Mr. Baldwin goes to work, Ed (Chief Elf) visits Claudia and her kids at their house and brings them to the north pole in a motorized Reindeer sleigh. There Claudia and the kids meet all the elves and SANTA! Then they go visit Santa's house where he has a talk with Claudia as to why they should stop the dynamiting. She is convinced that this tragedy will happen if they don't stop now. So she and the kids go home and she tries to get her husband to stop right away. Finally he stops the dynamiting.This is movie is full of love, laughter and joy and is a Christmas classic.

It's very enjoyable, a bit silly, and at the same time kind of gray and grim mixed with bright and festive.The gray and grim part comes from the ""real"" world where the adventure starts, an oil company compound in the arctic. Everything is covered with snow and though Christmas lights are up, things do look rather bleak. Also adding to the atmosphere is the CEO of the company, Mister Murdoch played by Mason Williams, who does a good job of being a tough as nails boss.But then in comes an elf, Ed, played by Paul Williams. And he invites the family to the North Pole to visit Santa Claus. Santa is concerned that the oil company, dynamiting for oil, will damage and in fact destroy North Pole City, ending Christmas forever.One odd thing is that the closer the family gets to North Pole City, the more the evidence mounts that Santa is real, the more the family thinks they're part of some ridiculously elaborate hoax or prank.The kids in the story are a bit silly, and not particularly enjoyable at first, but they do a nice job of being amazed by Santa once they realize he is a real person. Jacqline Smith is wonderful as the mother and Art Carney does an excellent job as Santa Claus; in fact he totally carries the movie.The Night They Saved Christmas has a few decent special effects, but I'm pretty sure it was a Made-For-TV Movie. But the movie also has some superb ideas, two in particular I must mention.One is they attempt to explain many of the Questions about Santa with advanced technology. How does Santa get into houses with small chimneys, or no chimneys? He uses a teleporter on the side of his sleigh. Santa uses storage satellites full of toys so that he doesn't have to return to the North Pole all the time for each load. And how does Santa visit every home in one night? He uses a strange device to slow down time, giving  him plenty of time to do it all in one night. ""Based on Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's all Greek to me though, very complex.""And the other idea done very well is that Santa explains that he's been Santa for hundreds of years. He mentions delivering to London during the Battle of Britain. He had his reindeer before Clement Moore wrote ""The Night Before Christmas"" - he named his reindeer after the poem because he liked it so much. In his den are some of the best selling toy from the 1800s. Very nicely done and an awesome concept I have not seen in any other Christmas movie.When Santa first makes his appearance he does so with a wonderful speech. The elfs are singing Jingle Bells and in comes Santa. ""I'm going to tell you one more time. Sing anything you want. White Christmas, Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. But no more Jingle Bells!"" He's been hearing it for centuries and it does wear on the nerves.Well worth a look!",4,Nicely done.

It had a big impact on me. Every year I would watch this movie while either decorating my tree of just chilling and having hot chocolate. It would still give me the chills of pure christmas magic.  This was one of my all time favorites, It had something about it, that just makes christmas the mother of all holidays.  When I was younger this movie seemed very real to me, and the way it was directed and how the plot really worked.  I really loved the whole Ice Fog thing, that really kicked in the North Pole effect and how no one is able to see it, with your own eyes and it was concealed by a huge wall of ice, and had a secert enternce, unless you go though it.  Now that was really cool.  I really was impressed with the whole talking into a candy cane phone thing, and the rollor coaster ride through the ice glaciers and snowy mountains. The most wonderfull thing about this film, that it was full of color, and the mood was set right. It had very little special effects and it was not over done either.  Now that I wish they had a real theme park based on this movie lol.  I am now 23, and I still love this film. Art Carney to me was the ideal Santa Claus, his looks and his personality hit it right on the money.  He took on his role very seriously at times and thats what drew me into this movie. Now I know Tim Allen puts on the red suit and still does a great job, but Art Carney really pulled his stings a bit more. I think with out all the joking around, Santa was very real in this movie. I like the fact that at one moment he had a long talk with Jacylin Smith  (the mother)about her childhood, and ya know the old saying, HE SEES YOU WHEN YOUR SLEEPING AND HE KNOWS WHEN YOUR AWAKE. Well Carney proved it.  That was a very special moment in that movie for me. It really gives you a sence of what santa would be like, in real life.  Art Carney's santa was very realistic and he was very down to earth with that role. The young actors who played her kids, David, Marrianne and CB. I liked how the younger one started to have his doubts untill he saw the real thing, I like the whole idea of oil drillers digging oil in the arctic circle and not having no idea that Santa really lived up there. That was very smart, This movie has alot of magic to it, for those who grew up with it, will know what I am talking about, it may not be a comedy but as for a drama its really good. It really grabs you and make your holiday spirt even bigger, but most of all it keeps you believing in the unbelieveable, and it keeps the magic of what childhood christmas should always and forever will be.  I really want this movie on dvd so badly, I know they have Dudly Moores Santa Claus the movie on dvd, now that was another Santa Classic. But this movie seemed more real, despite not having that much special effects and it really worked well in a real life setting in different situations. This movie deserve a new dvd packageing and as a few special features here and there based on the legend of Santa Claus.  This will be a holiday classic for when I have kids one day, and I will sit and watch it with my own family. Christmas in the 80' will always be a cherished memory of mine I will have for the rest of my life.  I will never forget how this movie maked me look at the way I look at Santa Claus in all my years of different holiday movies... Just keep up on praying that we get this one on dvd fast!",5,"this movie was pure holiday magic, as well as Dudly Moore's ""SANTA CLAUS THE MOVIE""",1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,3504,"['Christmas', '80', 'early', '90', 'were', 'other', 'christmas', 'movies', 'one', 'had', 'big', 'impact', 'year', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'decorating', 'tree', 'just', 'chilling', 'having', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'would', 'still', 'give', 'chills', 'pure', 'christmas', 'magic', 'was', 'one', 'time', 'had', 'something', 'just', 'christmas', 'mother', 'holidays', 'When', 'was', 'younger', 'movie', 'seemed', 'very', 'real', 'way', 'was', 'directed', 'how', 'plot', 'really', 'worked', 'really', 'loved', 'whole', 'Ice', 'Fog', 'thing', 'really', 'kicked', 'North', 'Pole', 'effect', 'how', 'one', 'able', 'see', 'own', 'eyes', 'was', 'concealed', 'huge', 'wall', 'ice', 'had', 'secert', 'enternce', 'go', 'Now', 'was', 'really', 'cool', 'really', 'was', 'impressed', 'whole', 'talking', 'candy', 'cane', 'phone', 'thing', 'rollor', 'coaster', 'ride', 'ice', 'glaciers', 'snowy', 'mountains', 'most', 'wonderfull', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'full', 'color', 'mood', 'was', 'set', 'right', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'not', 'done', 'Now', 'wish', 'had', 'real', 'theme', 'park', 'based', 'movie', 'lol', 'am', 'now', '23', 'still', 'love', 'film', 'Art', 'Carney', 'was', 'ideal', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'looks', 'personality', 'hit', 'right', 'money', 'took', 'role', 'very', 'seriously', 'times', 'thats', 'what', 'drew', 'movie', 'Now', 'know', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'red', 'suit', 'still', 'great', 'job', 'Art', 'Carney', 'really', 'pulled', 'stings', 'bit', 'more', 'think', 'out', 'joking', 'around', 'Santa', 'was', 'very', 'real', 'movie', 'fact', 'one', 'moment', 'had', 'long', 'talk', 'Jacylin', 'Smith', 'mother', 'childhood', 'ya', 'know', 'old', 'saying', 'HE', 'SEES', 'YOU', 'WHEN', 'YOUR', 'SLEEPING', 'HE', 'KNOWS', 'WHEN', 'YOUR', 'AWAKE', 'Well', 'Carney', 'proved', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'moment', 'movie', 'really', 'sence', 'what', 'santa', 'would', 'be', 'real', 'life', 'Art', 'Carney', 'santa', 'was', 'very', 'realistic', 'was', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'role', 'young', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'kids', 'David', 'Marrianne', 'CB', 'liked', 'how', 'younger', 'one', 'started', 'have', 'doubts', 'saw', 'real', 'thing', 'like', 'whole', 'idea', 'oil', 'drillers', 'digging', 'oil', 'arctic', 'circle', 'not', 'having', 'idea', 'Santa', 'really', 'lived', 'up', 'there', 'was', 'very', 'smart', 'movie', 'alot', 'magic', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'comedy', 'drama', 'really', 'good', 'really', 'grabs', 'make', 'holiday', 'spirt', 'even', 'bigger', 'most', 'believing', 'unbelieveable', 'magic', 'what', 'childhood', 'christmas', 'should', 'always', 'forever', 'will', 'be', 'really', 'want', 'movie', 'dvd', 'so', 'badly', 'know', 'have', 'Dudly', 'Moores', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'movie', 'dvd', 'now', 'was', 'Santa', 'Classic', 'movie', 'seemed', 'more', 'real', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'really', 'worked', 'well', 'real', 'life', 'setting', 'different', 'situations', 'movie', 'deserve', 'new', 'dvd', 'packageing', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'here', 'there', 'based', 'legend', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'will', 'be', 'holiday', 'classic', 'when', 'have', 'kids', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'sit', 'watch', 'own', 'family', 'Christmas', '80', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'cherished', 'memory', 'mine', 'will', 'have', 'rest', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'how', 'movie', 'maked', 'look', 'way', 'look', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'years', 'different', 'holiday', 'movies', 'Just', 'keep', 'up', 'praying', 'get', 'one', 'dvd', 'fast']",N/A

Santa enlists the aid of a mother played by Jaclyn Smith and her children to try and have the oil company drill at another site.  Paul LeMat plays Smith's husband who works for the oil company and a boss who is only interested in getting the job done ASAP.Art Carney makes a decent Santa Claus and June Lockhart shines as Mrs. Claus.

Paul Williams plays ""Ed"" the elf who tries to convince LeMat that he's going to destroy Santa's Castle and of course LeMat thinks he's a wacko.

It's an obvious and shallow idea, poorly executed -- a mirthless, cheerless contrivance.The concocted plot has Santa's home/factory on the verge of being destroyed by an oil company. Naturally, the kiddies step in to convince their parents that Santa Is Real And Something Terrible Is About To Happen (besides the movie itself).In addition to the obviousness and groaning dullness of the script, the film suffers from awful special effects. The miniatures of the magic sleigh that carries visitors to Santa are tr&eacute;s lousy.Then there's Art Carney's performance. He's Not At All Happy starring in something so inane. He's cheerful as a hemorrhoid, his delivery indicating that he wants this excruciating experience to be over as soon as possible, so he can pocket his paycheck and -- uh -- evacuate. Even the normally chirpy Mrs Robinson can't cheer him up.A better plot would have had Santa's elves whipping up a couple of tons of C-4, then blowing up the oil company's equipment -- and employees. Take THAT, environmental despoilers!Addendum: I recently saw excerpts from the ""Star Wars Holiday Special"".
