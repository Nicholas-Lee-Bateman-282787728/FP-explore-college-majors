I have a collection of music DVD's of all artist and bands, and you will not find one documentary DVD in my collection. They're a bunch of rubbish and waste of money, and when you use the word ""Concert"" for a title of a DVD like ABBA's ""In Concert"", it should be a concert DVD, and not a documentary about concert footages, is why I never got it. So when this awesome package of ABBA's TV Special performance in Japan finally got released, I was excited. This is as close to a concert you can get on a ABBA DVD.

1283216,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B002PQ1PE2,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[12, 13]","This hour long television special was made in Japan and originally broadcast in late 1978. It features the group performing many of their most well known songs as well as some album track (up until 1978). Most of the songs are mimed to playback and 3 are performed live and all are an absolute pleasure to watch. ""Tiger"" and ""That's Me"" for instance have several dancers dancing in the forefront and it works quite well. You even see Agnetha and Frida get close and personal with some of the dancers and the opening track, ""Eagle"" is lavishly done. What I loved about this program however, were the live renditions of their songs namely ""Money Money Money"", ""SOS"" and ""Thank You for the Music"". All are splendidly performed by the girls backed up by the boys, an orchestra and featuring some unique arrangement. Agnetha is specially delightful during her performance of ""Thank You for the Music"" and the confetti assault that ensues. I only wished they would have performed more live tracks. There was a certain edge in these performances in both the instrumental delivery and the girls solid vocals. It was surprising they didn't perform ""Waterloo"" live since this was a song that won them first place at The Eurovision Song Contest and as evidenced in ""ABBA The Movie"" and the excerpt that is shown in ""ABBA- In Concert"", this is a song they pretty much perfected singing. With all of that said, this is still a gem of a show that every ABBA fan will enjoy. It features the girls at their finest and their charming presence is a pleasure to watch.This DVD does offer a few bonuses, one is a mimed performance of ""If It Wasn't for the Nights"" which features a different sound mix and an interesting documentary of ABBA's hectic schedule while in Japan and like in ""ABBA-The Movie"", Agnetha's famous bottom is brought up once again. There is a scene in which Agnetha, looking all glam'd up, walks in front of the television camera towards the stage and the camera man childishly (and unprofessionally) lowers his camera to take a few shots at Agnetha's curvaceous bottom. You can't really blame him considering the gorgeous blonde was a sight to behold but come on, let's be professional here. It did manage to get a few chuckles from us while watching this but I am sure Agnetha F&auml;ltskog was not amused. An interesting booklet is also included and I must say since I watched several of these performances on YouTube, it was refreshing to see these again, in full screen with great sound and picture quality. It took 30 years but it was worth the wait. I only hope they release the entire ""Dick Cavett Meets ABBA Television Special"" with extras sometime soon.

ABBA's usual method was to do TV in countries and then follow up with concerts. The group offers bits of information between songs.

Gonzalez,"[21, 21]","For those of you that have seen or !gasp! purchased the bootleg version of this TV special, here's a chance to own not only a remastered version of that special, but all the little extras that come along with this (2) disc version. First off, a description of what this is...this is a TV special. They shot this for Japanese television in 1978 and what was customary then was that not all the songs are performed live. Some are lip sync. Note-this is not a live concert! They only perform for the television cameras and not a live audience. Some of the songs are clearly the recordings while others are performed with musicians behind them (Thank You For The Music) as an example.The extras include a 'fly on the wall' documentary on the second disc, and on the first a behind the scenes of ABBA in Japan doing promotion and preparing for this TV special. It is in Japanese but english subtitles are available.Picture quality and sound are great -the bonus track which is 'If it Wasn't For The Nights' is already in the special. The bonus is a remix of that same track**Also note this is full screen not letterboxed. What more can I say? If you love ABBA and haven't seen this pick this up! If you have, take a look again, this remastered version plays beautifuly and worth having in your collection.**UPDATE 11/6 - This review is for the 2 disc version, it is my understanding that there is also a 1 disc version that does not include the fly on the wall documentary which by the way is 'ABBA in Japan 1980.' That bonus documentary is a behind the scenes view of ABBA's tour of Japan in 1980. Sound quality on that is fair and includes snippets of there live performance but no complete songs. The second disc also contains a gallery of photographs set to music and a gallery of record sleeves for both LP's and 45's released in Japan.",5,For the ABBA fan,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,1836,"['have', 'seen', 'gasp', 'purchased', 'bootleg', 'version', 'TV', 'special', 'here', 'chance', 'own', 'not', 'only', 'remastered', 'version', 'special', 'little', 'extras', 'come', 'along', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'First', 'off', 'description', 'what', 'TV', 'special', 'shot', 'Japanese', 'television', '1978', 'what', 'was', 'customary', 'then', 'was', 'not', 'songs', 'are', 'performed', 'live', 'are', 'lip', 'sync', 'Note-this', 'not', 'live', 'concert', 'only', 'perform', 'television', 'cameras', 'not', 'live', 'audience', 'songs', 'are', 'clearly', 'recordings', 'others', 'are', 'performed', 'musicians', 'Thank', 'Music', 'example.The', 'extras', 'include', ""'fly"", 'wall', 'documentary', 'second', 'disc', 'first', 'scenes', 'ABBA', 'Japan', 'doing', 'promotion', 'preparing', 'TV', 'special', 'Japanese', 'english', 'subtitles', 'are', 'available.Picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'are', 'great', '-the', 'bonus', 'track', 'Was', ""n't"", 'Nights', 'already', 'special', 'bonus', 'remix', 'same', 'track**Also', 'note', 'full', 'screen', 'not', 'letterboxed', 'What', 'more', 'can', 'say', 'love', 'ABBA', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'pick', 'up', 'have', 'take', 'look', 'again', 'remastered', 'version', 'plays', 'beautifuly', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', '11/6', 'review', '2', 'disc', 'version', 'understanding', 'also', '1', 'disc', 'version', 'not', 'include', 'fly', 'wall', 'documentary', 'way', ""'ABBA"", 'Japan', '1980', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'view', 'ABBA', 'tour', 'Japan', '1980', 'Sound', 'quality', 'fair', 'snippets', 'live', 'performance', 'complete', 'songs', 'second', 'disc', 'also', 'gallery', 'photographs', 'set', 'music', 'gallery', 'record', 'sleeves', 'LP', '45', 'released', 'Japan']",N/A

1283220,A2CVLZH9YLBDN8,B002PQ1PE2,S. Hughes,"[2, 2]","This is for ABBA fans only.  The first Nov 1978 disc is pretty interesting with Japanese TV. Three of the songs are recorded live, Money Money Money, SOS, and Thank You for the Music.  The rest are recorded tracks from albums which can be a little boring because the music videos are so much better but its better to have the boring anyway.  It nice to see their outfits and how they interact with the Japanese TV.Japan during this time where huge into the Carpenters, so it made sense that ABBA came to Japan to win them over. Also the Japanese were so into taking video a lot more than Americans or Europeans were.  They wanted to record everything.  It shows here, cause they recorded a lot of nonsense but it adds layers of the behind the scenes that I will get into.November 1978 Benny and Frida were married a month before.  This was the only month in which they were in public as two part married couple in a group.  It looked amazingly too perfect.  It was.  Unlike the other releases of The Movie and even Live 1979 this shows us some things about their public lives the Japanese didnt even release at the time.  You can tell Agnetha was not very happy with Bjorn behind the scene, it looked quite forced.  I'm sure this Japanese trip was the icing on the cake for Agnetha to call it quits. Which was January of 1979 made public to the world.The bonus disc behind the scenes in 1980 was the most interesting.  Cause its almost like a keep secret no one knows too much about.  They were there about a month in March.  Agnetha again looks alone.  This time you can clearly see Bjorn's girlfriend and that ABBA were pushing themselves for this tour.  Now they showed RARE clips of live show but the Japanese ruined the live recording, really upset, As good as new for example was shown from tour but dubbed by studio recording.  Horrible.  I'm sure they dont have original soundtrack of it.  Such a huge disappointment.  The Japanese also showed warm ups from the tour and showed Frida and Benny still in a close relationship.  The Japanese filmed a lot of stuff which would have been considered rubbish by most people but looking back 30 years its a great history piece of ABBA after their prime hey day of 1976 to 1977.",4,ABBA RARE glimps into their lives Japanese Style--Sadness,1292457600,"12 16, 2010",2010,2227,"['ABBA', 'fans', 'only', 'first', 'Nov', '1978', 'disc', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'Three', 'songs', 'are', 'recorded', 'live', 'Money', 'Money', 'Money', 'SOS', 'Thank', 'Music', 'rest', 'are', 'recorded', 'tracks', 'albums', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'boring', 'music', 'videos', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'better', 'have', 'boring', 'anyway', 'nice', 'see', 'outfits', 'how', 'interact', 'Japanese', 'TV.Japan', 'time', 'where', 'huge', 'Carpenters', 'made', 'sense', 'ABBA', 'came', 'Japan', 'win', 'over', 'Also', 'Japanese', 'were', 'so', 'taking', 'video', 'lot', 'more', 'Americans', 'Europeans', 'were', 'wanted', 'record', 'everything', 'here', 'cause', 'recorded', 'lot', 'nonsense', 'layers', 'scenes', 'will', 'get', 'into.November', '1978', 'Benny', 'Frida', 'were', 'married', 'month', 'before', 'was', 'only', 'month', 'were', 'public', 'two', 'part', 'married', 'couple', 'group', 'looked', 'amazingly', 'too', 'perfect', 'was', 'other', 'releases', 'Movie', 'even', 'Live', '1979', 'things', 'public', 'Japanese', 'didnt', 'even', 'release', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'Agnetha', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'happy', 'Bjorn', 'scene', 'looked', 'quite', 'forced', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Japanese', 'trip', 'was', 'icing', 'cake', 'Agnetha', 'call', 'Which', 'was', 'January', '1979', 'made', 'public', 'world.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'scenes', '1980', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'Cause', 'almost', 'keep', 'secret', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'were', 'month', 'March', 'Agnetha', 'again', 'alone', 'time', 'can', 'clearly', 'see', 'Bjorn', 'girlfriend', 'ABBA', 'were', 'pushing', 'tour', 'Now', 'showed', 'RARE', 'clips', 'live', 'show', 'Japanese', 'ruined', 'live', 'recording', 'really', 'upset', 'As', 'good', 'new', 'example', 'was', 'shown', 'tour', 'dubbed', 'studio', 'recording', 'Horrible', ""'m"", 'sure', 'dont', 'have', 'original', 'soundtrack', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'Japanese', 'also', 'showed', 'warm', 'ups', 'tour', 'showed', 'Frida', 'Benny', 'still', 'close', 'relationship', 'Japanese', 'filmed', 'lot', 'stuff', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'considered', 'rubbish', 'most', 'people', 'looking', 'back', '30', 'years', 'great', 'history', 'piece', 'ABBA', 'prime', 'hey', 'day', '1976', '1977']",N/A
