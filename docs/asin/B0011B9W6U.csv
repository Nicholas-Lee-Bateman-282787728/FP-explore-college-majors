1130909,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B0011B9W6U,Allen Chapman,"[6, 11]","""The Living and The Dead"" is a very bizarre movie. The premise is quite simple, a husband must leave his sick wife for some time, he calls for a nurse to take of her while he's away, but his mentally challanged son insists on becoming caregiver. So it's just mom and son in this insanely large, mostly empty mansion. The son stops taking his meds and before long goes completely nutty at this expense of his poor mother. The movie is just very weird. The premise makes it sound better than it actually is.

1130911,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B0011B9W6U,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[0, 1]","'The Living And The Dead' is a British film that concerns a, um, slightly disturbed young man who lives with his parents in a rundown old estate.  His mother is terminally ill and needs constant nursing care.  When his father leaves for business, the young man locks his mother's nurse out of the house so that he can ""take care of her"".  He wants to be the ""man of the house"" but his mental issues get in the way.The film is presented in a way that I assume is supposed to mimic the young man's thought process.  Its very disjointed with a very loose narrative structures.  As viewers, we're never really one hundred percent sure as to what is actually going on.  The young man's ""care"" for his ill mother is, at times, very difficult to watch.  Its not so much care as it is brutality.This film I'm sure has been a hit with film geeks(no offense).  But its almost complete lack of structure sometimes makes the film a chore to slog through.  Technically the film is well made.  The acting is adequate.  I believe the director, Simon Rumley, has quite a bit of talent.  I don't know if he's made any films previously, but I'll be on the lookout for any future projects.  I didn't love 'TLATD', but his talent is evident.

The plot goes seriously off the rails in the second half - though, in truth, it never really makes sense to begin with.

1130913,A2LWUNJVOGYUIM,B0011B9W6U,Chad Radford,"[0, 2]","I had high hopes for this flick after reading about it in a horror magazine.  The premise was interesting but I found the execution overdone.  We can tell from the beginning of the film that the son is mentally disturbed but there are a lot of sound effects, music, and silly camera effects used to further punctuate that idea which I felt were way overdone and it came off more comical than disturbing.

1130914,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0011B9W6U,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","I would never dare claim to understand all of the nuances of this film, and I can see how a good many viewers will not find it appealing in the least, but I personally consider The Living and the Dead a brilliant motion picture.  This may well be the darkest, most depressing film I've ever seen; it's certainly among the most powerful, as it reaches parts of your heart and mind that are rarely if ever touched by anything other than personal tragedy.  Get any notions of visceral horror out of your head right now, as The Living and the Dead curls up in its very own corner of the horror genre, where the divide between horror and tragedy is at its thinnest.  A genteel descent into madness, every aspect of this film plays a part in the viewing experience: the surreal setting, the wonderfully evocative cinematography, the perfectly attuned soundtrack, and - above all else - some incredibly powerful performances, none more moving and mesmerizing than that of Leo Bill as the sick and increasingly deranged young man at the center of the story.The film's setting is Longleigh House, a vast estate that has all but become an empty tomb for the dysfunctional Brocklebank family.  ""Ex-Lord"" Donald Brocklebank (Roger Lloyd-Pack) faces the burdens of caring for his terminally ill wife Nancy (Kate Fahy) and looking after his mentally challenged son James (Leo Bill), even as the family fortune dwindles away to nothing (as can be seen in the emptiness that defines much of the house).  As long as James follows his routine (i.e., takes his pills), everything is fine; unfortunately, he sometimes stops taking his meds because he wrongly thinks he will feel normal without them.  That's not a problem as long as his father is there to look after him - unfortunately, Donald now finds himself with little choice but to travel to London for a few days in order to raise more funds for the care of his wife.  Desperate to prove himself and earn his father's trust, James takes advantage of his father's absence by barring the nurse from entering the house and vowing to take care of his sick mother himself.  He's woefully unprepared for the role of ""man of the house,"" and his bedridden mother is basically helpless to do anything about the situation.  You can't help but sympathize with James, but it's painful to watch the humiliation and suffering his mother is forced to endure over the course of several days.  Now off his meds entirely, James becomes dangerously unstable, essentially barricading the two of them inside the house.  Writer/director Simon Rumley employs a wonderful technique to represent the manic fits that James increasingly suffers, but that is just one aspect of this superb production.  It was apparently Rumley's intent to draw the viewer into the story, and he uses everything at his disposal - unusual camera angles, haunting music, atmosphere, and more - to do just that.  I can't see how anyone could call this film boring - disturbing and uncomfortable, yes, but not boring.This story may sound simple, but believe me when I tell you it is nothing of the kind, especially during the latter half of the movie.  I won't lie to you - things do get very confusing toward the end, but at the same time the already pervasive sense of tragedy is multiplied many times over in the process.  Even if you find yourself scratching your head when the credits begin to roll, you can't help but be moved by everything you have just seen.  As Friedrich Nietzsche said, ""If you stare long enough into the Abyss, the Abyss stares also into you.""

Unfortunately ""The Living and the Dead"" takes this promising concept and ruins it with a convoluted storyline and pretentious, overdone editing. Also ruining any chances for the film's success is the portrayal of the main character, James (the mentally ill son.)

In fact, he sort of reminds me of the titular character in ""Drop Dead Fred"".The film does have a handful of genuinely disturbing moments.

""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","Clearly this is not a horror movie about haunted mansions or axe-wielding maniacs, but it's as coolly disconcerting a thriller as you're likely to come across. Death of a parent, impotence in the face of an unbeatable disease, the awareness of one's own dementia, the fear of being left, alone, unwanted... These are the things that Simon Rumley wants to address, and he does so with a good intensity with The Living and the Dead. Well, as much as mildly I appreciate the film, it's not one I aim to re-visit any time real soon.The dank and captivating setting (Tottenham House, Wiltshire, UK) helps set the tone a whole heck of a lot, as do all three of the lead performances. Roger Lloyd-Pack and Kate Fahy deliver some great work as the parents, but it's Leo Bill as the slowly disintegrating James that commands the most attention. Most actors play ""mentally handicapped"" with a stock set of established tics, tricks and gimmicks, but this actor does something that not even Sean Penn could pull off: The ""retarded"" character is actually a three-dimensional, conflicted and entirely sympathetic anti-hero (anti-villain?) -- even when he's committing some really unpleasant acts.Most certainly not for all tastes, The Living and the Dead is a devious and admirably twisted little mind-bender of a genre flick. I hesitate to call it a true blue Horror Movie, but there's no denying that the movie packs a few meaty punches -- and if you stay with it till the end, I bet this flick will stick with you for at least a few hours.

Or year.""The Living and the Dead"" is one of the most melancholy, depressing, morose, life negating, soul destroying films that I have ever seen.  I give it four stars because I'm more than certain that this is precisely what Rumley was aiming for, and art of this sort has a place as well: how much CAN you watch without reaching for the handgun locked away in case the Neocons finally get absolute power?A morbid and remorseless descent into impoverished and destroyed lives, ""Living"" takes us into the mind and limited reality of  schizophrenic man-child James Brocklebank (played exquisitely by Leo Bill).  Constantly contorting in handicapped agony and yearning for the constant company of his stressed out father and invalid mother, swallows his gigantic medications as a child might swallow candy and fears more than all else being left alone.  A sort of demented youthful British glow makes him lovable although all one wants to do while watching him drool, scream, and shoot himself up with mysterious syringes is to look away.  Making a very serious judgment in error, his father leaves his physically ill mother alone with James to go seek treatment for her mysterious disease.James decides that he is going to make his parents proud of him by taking care of his mother all by himself in his father's absence--that is, by administering her medications himself, taking her to the bathroom himself (the scene of incontinence and James' incomprehension is simply unparalleled in any foulness I've seen recently, in fantasy or reality).  He also decides that the Nurse his father has appointed for her is not to be let in the house, and becomes enraged when his mother desperately asks for her.  As she slowly rots from his unintentional but decidedly violent mistreatment, he descends into hallucinations involving both mother and father of a hallucinatory, transgender quality.Well, after stabbing a whole bunch of people he mistakes for his mother, James then stabs himself at his mother's funeral while hallucinating that she is there.Then his father, who has gone completely insane from these traumatic events, is carted away from the desolate mansion in which all has been lost, with the memory of his son's childish plea: ""You always say you're going to be there, but you always leave the room!""This will test your mind, heart, and above all: the stomach.",4,My.....word,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,2462,"['Director', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'really', 'bad', 'day', 'fact', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'bad', 'week', 'year', 'Living', 'Dead', 'one', 'most', 'melancholy', 'depressing', 'morose', 'life', 'negating', 'soul', 'destroying', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'give', 'four', 'stars', ""'m"", 'more', 'certain', 'precisely', 'what', 'Rumley', 'was', 'aiming', 'art', 'sort', 'place', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'much', 'CAN', 'watch', 'reaching', 'handgun', 'locked', 'away', 'case', 'Neocons', 'finally', 'get', 'absolute', 'power', 'morbid', 'remorseless', 'descent', 'impoverished', 'destroyed', 'lives', 'Living', 'mind', 'limited', 'reality', 'schizophrenic', 'man-child', 'James', 'Brocklebank', 'played', 'exquisitely', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'Constantly', 'contorting', 'handicapped', 'agony', 'yearning', 'constant', 'company', 'stressed', 'out', 'father', 'invalid', 'mother', 'gigantic', 'medications', 'child', 'might', 'swallow', 'candy', 'more', 'else', 'being', 'left', 'alone', 'sort', 'demented', 'youthful', 'British', 'glow', 'lovable', 'one', 'do', 'watching', 'drool', 'scream', 'shoot', 'mysterious', 'syringes', 'look', 'away', 'Making', 'very', 'serious', 'judgment', 'error', 'father', 'physically', 'ill', 'alone', 'James', 'go', 'seek', 'treatment', 'mysterious', 'disease.James', 'going', 'make', 'parents', 'proud', 'taking', 'care', 'mother', 'father', 'absence', 'administering', 'medications', 'taking', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'incontinence', 'James', 'incomprehension', 'simply', 'unparalleled', 'foulness', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'recently', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'also', 'Nurse', 'father', 'appointed', 'not', 'be', 'let', 'house', 'becomes', 'enraged', 'when', 'mother', 'desperately', 'slowly', 'rots', 'unintentional', 'decidedly', 'violent', 'mistreatment', 'hallucinations', 'involving', 'mother', 'father', 'hallucinatory', 'transgender', 'quality.Well', 'stabbing', 'whole', 'bunch', 'people', 'mother', 'James', 'then', 'stabs', 'mother', 'funeral', 'hallucinating', 'there.Then', 'father', 'who', 'gone', 'completely', 'insane', 'traumatic', 'events', 'carted', 'away', 'desolate', 'mansion', 'been', 'lost', 'memory', 'son', 'childish', 'plea', 'always', 'say', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'there', 'always', 'leave', 'room', 'will', 'test', 'mind', 'heart', 'stomach']",The Living And The Dead

Hard to follow a movie or empathize with characters if we only see their actions and get no glimpse into what is going on inside them.Many scenes were of ""fast-forward"" action sequences.

Unfortunately, the end result is a sad mash of weird and boring.  As already noted, this film is about a man needing to tend to business while leaving behind an invalid wife and mentally ill son in a decrepit mansion.  He arranges for a nurse to look after them both.  Before he leaves, the father catches the son not taking his nightly injections (of what I'd like to know) and a very intriguing conversation follows.""Sometimes I like to pretend I'm normal""""But you're not normal""""But I could be if you let me""So sets the stage for the son keeping the nurse away and attempting to take care of his mother and himself to make his father proud.  Of course he chooses not to take his medication and things go horribly awry.  For example, he figures if he gives his mother more medication she'll get better faster.  Weirdness ensues and it all ends rather badly.I really liked the physicality of the son.  He moves in a unique way as befitting his mental state.  The super fast motion of the son off his medication with everything as a blur and characters in a normal state moving slowly and monotonously through life was interesting but not enough.  I liked how the mansion was a main character as well and reflected its inhabitants.  The movie starts with an old bedraggled man in a precarious mental state roaming through a deteriorating mansion and then we go backwards to see how the character reached that state.  Okay.  But why would a health system great enough to perform an operation on sight at the mansion allow such conditions to exist?  Wouldn't the nurse have come much quicker to their aid knowing the exact state of affairs rather then allow it to continue for days until calling the police for help? The plot moved unnaturally, just to make things fit.  The son takes handfuls of pills each morning and injections at night.  For what?!?  It is never explained but we know he's been this way for a while.  What exactly is wrong with the wife/mother?  She has recently become an invalid since the photo of the happy smiling family looks recent.  She can stand but not walk?  What has happened to drastically change the happy family in the photo to what they have become now.  Bankruptcy?  Nothing is explained and what unfolds is a mess of weirdness, hallucinations and boring shots of everyday life that drag on.There were no commentaries on this dvd which might have changed my view.

While away, Nurse Mary is expected to arrive and care for Nancy, but the ever ambitious man-child son, James, is off his meds and eager to prove he can take care of things himself. For Nancy, her time alone with well-intentioned James is an exercise in terror, and she may not make it through her husband's absence alive. But inside James's mind, he is being terrorized as well, and father Donald may be suffering the most of all.""The Living and the Dead"" is a dark, depressing, and difficult film to watch. It starts out slow, at times is disgusting, and there's not a smile to be had from it. However, the pacing picks up well once it gets going, if you can get to that point without feeling nauseous. Though none of the characters are particularly likable and some attempt to make them more endearing would have been a good idea, sympathy for those around the annoyingly dangerous James is still accessible. The performances are all very good, and though it doesn't come off to me as truly fitting into the horror genre, it does successfully create an atmosphere of madness and empathetic fear. Directed and written by Simon Rumley, ""The Living and the Dead"" IS an ugly film, though it doesn't seem unintentionally so. I can recommend this film to the fan of bizarre and disturbing films and to the adventurous viewer, though not really to the average filmgoer. It's reasonably well-done, though I have to stress again that it is difficult to watch because of the strongly uncomfortable and depressing mood it sets.",3,"Disturbing, Tragic, and Difficult to Watch",1204761600,"03 6, 2008",2008,1697,"['Donald', 'Brocklebank', 'once', 'wealthy', 'man', 'forced', 'leave', 'bedridden', 'wife', 'Nancy', 'alone', 'psychotic', 'son', 'London', 'settle', 'problem', 'medical', 'costs', 'away', 'Nurse', 'Mary', 'expected', 'arrive', 'care', 'Nancy', 'ever', 'ambitious', 'man-child', 'son', 'James', 'meds', 'eager', 'prove', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'things', 'Nancy', 'time', 'alone', 'well-intentioned', 'James', 'exercise', 'terror', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'husband', 'absence', 'alive', 'James', 'mind', 'being', 'terrorized', 'as', 'well', 'father', 'Donald', 'may', 'be', 'suffering', 'most', 'Living', 'Dead', 'dark', 'depressing', 'difficult', 'film', 'watch', 'out', 'slow', 'times', 'disgusting', 'not', 'smile', 'be', 'had', 'However', 'pacing', 'up', 'well', 'going', 'can', 'get', 'point', 'feeling', 'nauseous', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'particularly', 'likable', 'attempt', 'make', 'more', 'endearing', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'idea', 'sympathy', 'annoyingly', 'dangerous', 'James', 'still', 'accessible', 'performances', 'are', 'very', 'good', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'truly', 'fitting', 'horror', 'genre', 'successfully', 'create', 'atmosphere', 'madness', 'empathetic', 'fear', 'Directed', 'written', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'Living', 'Dead', 'ugly', 'film', ""n't"", 'seem', 'unintentionally', 'so', 'can', 'recommend', 'film', 'fan', 'bizarre', 'disturbing', 'films', 'adventurous', 'viewer', 'not', 'really', 'average', 'filmgoer', 'reasonably', 'well-done', 'have', 'stress', 'again', 'difficult', 'watch', 'strongly', 'uncomfortable', 'depressing', 'mood']",The Living And The Dead

All kinds of bad things can result.It's such a shame that with a properly-done story, this could have been a very memorable film.

It's unfair, though, to not justify my opinions because I'm sure that there are some people who will like this movie. In fact, there may be some who read my review and think that it's the movie for them. It's just simply not the movie for me.When the movie began, I felt so sorry for the father. His gigantic English mansion is empty of nearly all furniture (insinuating financial ruin), his picture is in the paper again (and not for a good reason), his wife is up a million flights of stairs in what might be her death bed, and his grown son is in a state of deranged mental illness. I could feel the absolute despair of the father seeping through the scenes of the movie. And the setting of an echoing old mansion is the perfect gothic setting for such a story of despair.The father has to leave on business, and this is where the movie starts to go into a downward spiral for me. You begin to see the world through the eyes of the deranged son as he takes the phone off the hook and locks all the doors so that he can take care of his mother without interference from the nurse. However, he is in no state to take care of anyone. He takes his medication in increasingly larger doses, causing him to seriously flip out. The movie plays in fast motion. The music goes crazy. And in his psychotic frenzy, he neglects his bedridden mother to the point of her completely soiling herself and her bed. On and on this goes: pills, psychotic frenzy, the yelling of ""mummy"", the moaning of his mom and calling for a nurse, etc. The story repeats itself and heads to an end that you know can't be good: pills, needles, knives, needles, blood, pills, screaming, dementia, hallucinations, knives, needles, blood, screaming, dementia. I repeat myself here on purpose. These are not elements that I enjoy seeing en masse in movies.I liked the concept of the movie: showing how overwhelming it can be to care for one person to care for two ill people and stay sane. Unfortunately, I liked nothing beyond the beginning of the movie. The screen would turn dark, and I kept hoping that it was switching over to the credits instead of turning from night to yet another day in the mansion of the deranged.",1,Too Much Crazy For Me,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,2299,"['feel', 'awful', 'giving', 'movie', 'one', 'star', 'honesty', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'left', 'feeling', 'nauseas', 'unfair', 'though', 'not', 'justify', 'opinions', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'who', 'read', 'review', 'think', 'movie', 'just', 'simply', 'not', 'movie', 'me.When', 'movie', 'began', 'felt', 'so', 'sorry', 'father', 'gigantic', 'English', 'mansion', 'empty', 'nearly', 'furniture', 'insinuating', 'financial', 'ruin', 'picture', 'paper', 'again', 'not', 'good', 'reason', 'wife', 'up', 'million', 'flights', 'stairs', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'death', 'bed', 'grown', 'son', 'state', 'deranged', 'mental', 'illness', 'could', 'feel', 'absolute', 'despair', 'father', 'seeping', 'scenes', 'movie', 'setting', 'echoing', 'old', 'mansion', 'perfect', 'gothic', 'setting', 'story', 'despair.The', 'father', 'leave', 'business', 'where', 'movie', 'go', 'downward', 'spiral', 'begin', 'see', 'world', 'eyes', 'deranged', 'son', 'phone', 'hook', 'doors', 'so', 'can', 'take', 'care', 'mother', 'interference', 'nurse', 'However', 'state', 'take', 'care', 'anyone', 'medication', 'increasingly', 'larger', 'doses', 'causing', 'seriously', 'flip', 'out', 'movie', 'fast', 'motion', 'music', 'crazy', 'psychotic', 'frenzy', 'bedridden', 'mother', 'point', 'completely', 'soiling', 'bed', 'pills', 'psychotic', 'frenzy', 'yelling', 'mummy', 'moaning', 'mom', 'calling', 'nurse', 'etc', 'story', 'heads', 'end', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'good', 'pills', 'needles', 'knives', 'needles', 'blood', 'pills', 'screaming', 'dementia', 'hallucinations', 'knives', 'needles', 'blood', 'screaming', 'dementia', 'repeat', 'here', 'purpose', 'are', 'not', 'elements', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'en', 'masse', 'movies.I', 'liked', 'concept', 'movie', 'showing', 'how', 'overwhelming', 'can', 'be', 'care', 'one', 'person', 'care', 'two', 'ill', 'people', 'stay', 'sane', 'Unfortunately', 'liked', 'nothing', 'beginning', 'movie', 'screen', 'would', 'turn', 'dark', 'kept', 'hoping', 'was', 'switching', 'credits', 'instead', 'turning', 'night', 'yet', 'day', 'mansion', 'deranged']",The Living And The Dead

1130936,A1JEFESGLIS076,B0011B9W6U,rsoonsa,"[1, 2]","A preference of director Simon Rumley for this film's title before its release was THE LIVING IN THE HOME OF THE DEAD since the work that he formulated is based round his potent emotional reactions to the death of his mother from cancer, an exhausting event for Rumley as well as for the disease's victim.  The film will be at least in part artistically inaccessible to those viewers who will be uncomfortable watching a rather nauseous compendium of scenes filled with the actions of an obvious madman, in addition to unbridled drug usage, gore, feces, and vomitus.  For the most part, Rumley employs a brilliantly expressionistic method in order to reflect his repugnance at recollecting the dismal three month decline into death of his mother, with his intent here obviously being communication to viewers of his ruinous sense of incertitude and bewilderment, quite conventional states for one observing another person gradually perish.  Because there is no particular linear aspect to the narrative, the tone of the film steadily becomes surreal, with incongruous and often ostensibly senseless scenes born from a nightmarishly burdened subconscious, and while handling of this type of episode seems at times laboured and in poor taste, a viewer should be aware of the internal flaying that became a primary determinant for the piece.  Shot in only eighteen days within the voluminous Cardigan Savernake House in Wiltshire, England, using eight of the derelict structure's 250 rooms, the picture is efficiently crafted by director, cast and crew, and offers a bravura turn from Leo Bill playing as addled son of a dying woman.  The film was in reality constructed during post-production editing, and there will be precious little for a majority of viewers to like, since the affair plainly is too repellent for most audiences.  None the less, one looks forward to whatever the talented Rumley will provide next, now that this purgative production has been completed.",3,Director's Effort To Depict The Pain And Horror Of A Parent's Death Sets This Film Into A Class By Itself.,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,1970,"['preference', 'director', 'Simon', 'Rumley', 'film', 'title', 'release', 'was', 'LIVING', 'IN', 'THE', 'HOME', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'work', 'formulated', 'based', 'potent', 'emotional', 'reactions', 'death', 'mother', 'cancer', 'exhausting', 'event', 'Rumley', 'as', 'well', 'disease', 'victim', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'part', 'artistically', 'inaccessible', 'viewers', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'rather', 'nauseous', 'compendium', 'scenes', 'filled', 'actions', 'obvious', 'madman', 'addition', 'unbridled', 'drug', 'usage', 'gore', 'feces', 'vomitus', 'most', 'part', 'Rumley', 'brilliantly', 'expressionistic', 'method', 'order', 'reflect', 'repugnance', 'recollecting', 'dismal', 'three', 'month', 'decline', 'death', 'mother', 'intent', 'here', 'obviously', 'being', 'communication', 'viewers', 'ruinous', 'sense', 'incertitude', 'bewilderment', 'quite', 'conventional', 'states', 'one', 'observing', 'person', 'gradually', 'perish', 'particular', 'linear', 'aspect', 'narrative', 'tone', 'film', 'steadily', 'surreal', 'incongruous', 'often', 'ostensibly', 'senseless', 'scenes', 'born', 'nightmarishly', 'burdened', 'subconscious', 'handling', 'type', 'episode', 'times', 'laboured', 'poor', 'taste', 'viewer', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'internal', 'flaying', 'became', 'primary', 'determinant', 'piece', 'Shot', 'only', 'eighteen', 'days', 'voluminous', 'Cardigan', 'Savernake', 'House', 'Wiltshire', 'England', 'using', 'eight', 'derelict', 'structure', '250', 'rooms', 'picture', 'efficiently', 'crafted', 'director', 'cast', 'crew', 'bravura', 'turn', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'playing', 'addled', 'son', 'dying', 'woman', 'film', 'was', 'reality', 'constructed', 'post-production', 'editing', 'will', 'be', 'precious', 'little', 'majority', 'viewers', 'like', 'affair', 'plainly', 'too', 'repellent', 'most', 'audiences', 'None', 'less', 'one', 'forward', 'whatever', 'talented', 'Rumley', 'will', 'provide', 'next', 'now', 'purgative', 'production', 'been', 'completed']",The Living And The Dead

He's arranged for a caregiver for his bed-ridden and ill wife, but his mentally challenged son, James, wants to take care of mommy himself.  So dad leaves and James chases away the caregiver and it's just James and Mommy in this huge old mansion in a terrible state of disrepair.James can't take care of himself, much less his ill mother.  He goes through the routine of getting his medications but forgets to actually take them.  So with James behind the wheel as mom's caretaker, things go downhill pretty fast.  His concept of time is erratic, so he doesn't get mom to the bathroom on time, he thinks extra pills will make her well faster, and forgets where he's left her.  This isn't the entire gist of the movie though.The hired caretaker brings the police to break into the house.  There's a very bizarre operation scene that takes place in the house (not in a hospital), a lot of freaky-deaky photography showing James scampering all over the house in his fugues, and a very trippy dream scene during one of James's overdoses.  Top this off with flash-forwards and flash-backs, and you have the movie.The plot was weak, I hate to say.  The photography was dark in too many scenes.  Wardrobe went a little over the top with James, as if he weren't acting freaky enough, they dressed him in high-waters with white socks and an outlandishly wide tie.  The director did manage to capture the mood and surrealism of James's fugues, and the acting was rather decent.Overall, this isn't a movie I would recommend unless you choose to rent first.

At one point the viewers are drawn into this psychotic drama, as the movie wavers between the point of view of the son and the father.Ultimately and as in many movies that attempt to examine madness, the viewer is left confused and dissatisfied.

1130939,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B0011B9W6U,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[1, 1]","This film follows a mentally handicapped young man who is living with his father and invalid mother.  The film sets up early on that James has a severe mental illness that renders him unable to care for himself.  His mother Nancy is confined to her bed, while father Donald has his hands full caring for both.  But when Donald is called away on business, James gets angry that he isn't left in charge.  He wants to prove to his parents that he is the man of the house - so he locks the hired nurse out of the house and begins to try and take care of his mother.  Things quickly spiral out of control as James stops taking his medicine and ""forces"" his care onto his distraught mother.The setup for the film is quite nice.  Rumley creates a soft-spot for the audience in James and his father.  Early scenes show James freaking out and his father lovingly taking care of him.  Later, as James begins to put his mother's life in danger, we do not feel so much angry with James, but rather we feel sorry for him.  This film is less about the danger faced by Nancy, and more about the sadness of James' strong desire yet incapicity to care for his mom.Unfortunately, the main story ""ends"" about midway through the film, and the final act begins to fall apart.  James' psychosis begins to go into overdrive, and he has one of the strangest hallucinations I've seen in film.  Later, his father goes similarly nuts, and it begins to become difficult to follow the storyline.  By the end, it was difficult to tell who had done what to whom, and how much of what we saw really took place, and when.  This muddled final act undoes all the good the first half had set up.Performances are good across the board, with Leo Bill having the most difficult job of the three bringing James' psychosis to life.  The character he creates is nearly laughable in the early portions of the film (think an amalgamation of the characters Rick and Vyvyan from the UK TV series, THE YOUNG ONES).  As the film progresses, the odd mannerisms become equally frightening and heartbreaking.If Rumley had stretched out the middle portion of the film a bit longer, and had a more comprehensible ending, I might have recommended the film - as it is, it is largely a disappointment.  I give it three stars for good acting and an interesting opening portion.Take Note: while there is only a sparse amount of gore and no sex or language, the film has some disturbing thematic moments between the mother and son as he tries to care for her.",3,Muddled final act derails the promising first half.,1205107200,"03 10, 2008",2008,2500,"['film', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'living', 'father', 'invalid', 'mother', 'film', 'up', 'early', 'James', 'severe', 'mental', 'illness', 'unable', 'care', 'mother', 'Nancy', 'confined', 'bed', 'father', 'Donald', 'hands', 'full', 'caring', 'when', 'Donald', 'called', 'away', 'business', 'James', 'angry', ""n't"", 'left', 'charge', 'prove', 'parents', 'man', 'house', 'so', 'hired', 'nurse', 'house', 'try', 'take', 'care', 'mother', 'Things', 'quickly', 'spiral', 'control', 'James', 'taking', 'medicine', 'forces', 'care', 'distraught', 'mother.The', 'setup', 'film', 'quite', 'nice', 'Rumley', 'soft-spot', 'audience', 'James', 'father', 'Early', 'scenes', 'show', 'James', 'freaking', 'out', 'father', 'lovingly', 'taking', 'care', 'Later', 'James', 'put', 'mother', 'life', 'danger', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'angry', 'James', 'rather', 'feel', 'sorry', 'film', 'less', 'danger', 'faced', 'Nancy', 'more', 'sadness', 'James', 'strong', 'desire', 'yet', 'incapicity', 'care', 'mom.Unfortunately', 'main', 'story', 'ends', 'midway', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'fall', 'apart', 'James', 'psychosis', 'go', 'overdrive', 'one', 'strangest', 'hallucinations', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'Later', 'father', 'similarly', 'nuts', 'become', 'difficult', 'follow', 'storyline', 'end', 'was', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'had', 'done', 'what', 'whom', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'really', 'took', 'place', 'when', 'muddled', 'final', 'act', 'good', 'first', 'half', 'had', 'set', 'up.Performances', 'are', 'good', 'board', 'Leo', 'Bill', 'having', 'most', 'difficult', 'job', 'three', 'bringing', 'James', 'psychosis', 'life', 'character', 'nearly', 'laughable', 'early', 'portions', 'film', 'think', 'amalgamation', 'characters', 'Rick', 'Vyvyan', 'UK', 'TV', 'series', 'THE', 'YOUNG', 'ONES', 'film', 'odd', 'mannerisms', 'become', 'equally', 'frightening', 'heartbreaking.If', 'Rumley', 'had', 'stretched', 'out', 'middle', 'portion', 'film', 'bit', 'longer', 'had', 'more', 'comprehensible', 'ending', 'might', 'have', 'recommended', 'film', 'largely', 'disappointment', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'good', 'acting', 'interesting', 'opening', 'portion.Take', 'Note', 'only', 'sparse', 'amount', 'gore', 'sex', 'language', 'film', 'disturbing', 'thematic', 'moments', 'mother', 'son', 'care']",The Living And The Dead
1130940,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B0011B9W6U,Terry Mesnard,"[0, 1]","I don't rightly know what to think or say about this little weird film.  Reading the synopsis was enough to give me a reason to try it.  Basically, a family, facing bankruptcy, is falling apart.  The father of the family has to leave his sick wife in the care of a nurse and his troubled man-child of a son.The son, obviously mentally troubled, wants his parents to be proud of him and ends up cutting him and his mother off from the outside world, shutting out the nurse and trying to take care of his mom by himself.  From here, the story spirals down towards tragedy since the son obviously cannot care for his mother.Okay.  So from the very beginning of the film, I didn't really buy into the whole plot of the film.  The acting was very off-putting originally, with the actor who plays James, the troubled son, alternating between decent and horrible in his portrayal.As the story continued, the way the film was shot really kept me from being pulled into what was happening.  There are times when James will run from place to place and the camera work speeds up, to show his state of mind, I'm sure, and really odd music plays.  It's at moments like these where I start to look at the clock wondering...how much longer?Even though it's been kind of billed as a horror film, it's not.  Sure, the events that occur are disturbing and it's definitely a bizzare little flick.  But, on the whole, I would categorize it more as a tragic drama than a horror film.I didn't really give you much to go on...but I just...simply don't know what to say.

Zero stars, if I were allowed to rate it so low.This is a psychological horror movie, of sorts. A mentally ill man lives with his senior citizen parents. His mother is gravely ill and bed ridden.  The father has to leave for a while, and the mentally ill son tries to care for his sickly mom.That's the whole story. The young man has many difficulties providing the kind of care his mom needs.  At one point, she soils the bed and he dumps her into a bathtub full of rust-brown water - at first scalding, but then ice cold after he leaves her unattended for a long spell. She is shivering as he pushes her in a wheelchair back to her bedroom, still in the nightgown she soiled earlier. He strips her naked and puts another gown on her.The sequence unfolds at a brutally slow pace (as does the entire grueling movie).  I chose to describe that particular segement because I found it to be indicative of the general tone of the entire show. If that sounds like entertainment to you, by all means seek out this film and have a blast.

Centered on the death of the mother of the family, the plot revolves around Donald Brocklebank,  a father who is seeing his manor fall into poverty, his psychotic son and his terminally ill wife. James, the son, is raging with visions that he can take care of his ailing mother, which takes up the movie's disturbing first third. When Daddy heads to London to find more funds to take care of his wife (or answer to some hinted upon controversy published in the local newspaper - you're never quite sure), James locks out the family nurse so he can be the caretaking ""man of the house."" Thus is his mother sent into a claustrophobic filmed hell. The scenes where James cares for/brutalizes her are maddeningly disturbing.Then the Police and rescue arrive. Or do they? James loads himself with drugs and falls into deeper, murderous madness. Or does he? Daddy Donald is protective of his son - or is he repulsed? Yes, the movie really is that disjointed, presented in the schizophrenia that James (Leo Bill) must have running through his own mind. But then again, as the film's final act posits, maybe James isn't the one descended into madness.It's easy to see how ""The Living and The Dead"" would be a hit with film fest types, as it has just the barest hint of narrative from which all sorts of angst and art dangle. Director/Writer Simon Lumley has commented that his movie is a direct reaction to losing his own mother to Cancer, and the infuriating helplessness he felt as the disease progressed. It is a blunt emotional force, confusing and frightening, that he brings to ""The Living and The Dead,"" and not an altogether watchable one. This is not a movie that you'll feel good about after you watch it, and at times it made me feel like I was seeing a close cousin to Roman Polanski's hallucinatory nightmare,Repulsion.

Things are so convoluted and disoriented that even when the plot begins to make sense, it doesn't matter.Former Lord Donald Brocklebank's (Roger Lloyd-Pack) wife, Nancy (Kate Fahyl) is physically ill and is getting worse. Meanwhile, Donald's only son, James (Leo Bill), is delusional and a borderline psychotic who can't be trusted to be by himself. The family lives in the once extravagant, but now decaying Longleigh House that for a family of three is just way, way, too big. Donald has to leave for a few days and go to London to arrange financing for Nancy's surgery. He's not too worried because despite his family's problems, he's been gone before and Nurse Mary (Sarah Ball) has always taken care of things while he was away. Donald leaves while it is still dark and Nurse Mary hasn't arrived, yet. James wakes up and decides that Nurse Mary isn't needed and he will take care of his mother himself. He leaves the phone off the hook and bolts the doors. James does alright if there isn't any stress and if he's taking his medication properly, but he stops taking his evening medication and eventually begins confusing his pills with his mother's. What results is a confusing and dizzying nightmare that leads to tragedy.I try to find at least one good thing in every film I see. The best thing about THE LIVING AND THE DEAD is that there is some really good acting in the movie. Unfortunately, most people are never going to notice the acting because the movie is so incredibly bad. For example, there is no explanation why Donald is no longer a Lord, or what exactly Mary is suffering from, or what happened to turn James from the happy young man he once was into the delusional and crazy person he has become. About a third of the movie is sped up (I assume to reflect the mental state of James) but this technique fails at its apparent purpose and becomes an irritating and annoying nuisance that distracts from the few good things going on in the movie. There's not much dialogue and what little there is as disjointed as the movie's structure. The lighting is horrible and the music is atrocious. Five minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end, but there was about eighty-five minutes left to go.
