Every now and then I would pick up the box, read the story-line, and then move onto something else. Last night, we finally decided to give it a chance and it paid off.The movie has themes of betrayal and obsession, and though there are a few sex scenes, that is not the dominant part of this movie. The psychology of the main character is complex, though we only get brief windows into how past experiences made him who he is as we see him.The acting was excellent and the overall filming very good. The movie isn't slow, but it unfolds at a graduated pace, and you're never quite sure where it's heading.
