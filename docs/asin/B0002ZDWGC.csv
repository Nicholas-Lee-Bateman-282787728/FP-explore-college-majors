In the past few years he has expanded his horizons into movie- making, and one of the results of this new venture is ""Uncovered: The War Against Iraq"". In this documentary, Greenwald goes on a fact- finding mission to find the truth about the war, laying everything out in the open, for all to see.The thing about this documentary that adds tremendously to its credibility is its use of high- ranking government agents who explain the facts about the war. They talk about the false claims about the weapons of mass destruction, the exaggerated claims that the nation of Iraq was a grave threat to American security, and the way the Bush administration covered up the facts and even changed its story once it was discovered that no dangerous weapons really existed. Greenwald doesn't just present ordinary people who have an ax to grind with Bush and his policies. He instead brings former CIA agents, weapons inspectors, and even Bush's former Secretary of the Army in front of the camera, allowing each person to explain what happened and why the Bush team was so adamant about having a chance to attack Iraq.One thing that viewers may not like about this documentary is its pacing. Because it is comprised mostly of interviews with little in the way of action scenes, many parts move rather slowly and could cause some people to lose attention. Also, there is no real humor in this film. Unlike Fahrenheit 9/11 which uses wit on more than one occasion to keep the viewer entertained, this documentary remains serious from start to finish. Mostly, it's a documentary of interviews and while they are very good and very revealing, they don't succeed very well at keeping the entertainment at a reasonably high level.Still, this documentary is a very good one to watch. Greenwald has done a commendable job assembling together all of these important people to give their take on the war, explaining how it came about and how the people of the United States and the world were fooled into accepting it. It presents a more intellectual take on the Iraqi conflict, and it will keep viewers thinking and questioning the true motives for the war long after the documentary comes to an end.",4,Was the Iraqi War Launched on Moral Grounds?,1101686400,"11 29, 2004",2004,2333,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'made', 'name', 'Hollywood', 'producing', 'directing', 'television', 'mini-', 'series', 'other', 'informative', 'programs', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'expanded', 'horizons', 'movie-', 'making', 'one', 'results', 'new', 'venture', 'Uncovered', 'War', 'Against', 'Iraq', 'documentary', 'Greenwald', 'fact-', 'finding', 'mission', 'find', 'truth', 'war', 'laying', 'everything', 'out', 'open', 'see.The', 'thing', 'documentary', 'tremendously', 'credibility', 'use', 'high-', 'ranking', 'government', 'agents', 'who', 'explain', 'facts', 'war', 'talk', 'false', 'claims', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction', 'exaggerated', 'claims', 'nation', 'Iraq', 'was', 'grave', 'threat', 'American', 'security', 'way', 'Bush', 'administration', 'covered', 'up', 'facts', 'even', 'changed', 'story', 'was', 'discovered', 'dangerous', 'weapons', 'really', 'existed', 'Greenwald', ""n't"", 'just', 'present', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'ax', 'grind', 'Bush', 'policies', 'instead', 'former', 'CIA', 'agents', 'weapons', 'inspectors', 'even', 'Bush', 'former', 'Secretary', 'Army', 'front', 'camera', 'allowing', 'person', 'explain', 'what', 'happened', 'why', 'Bush', 'team', 'was', 'so', 'adamant', 'having', 'chance', 'attack', 'Iraq.One', 'thing', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'documentary', 'pacing', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'interviews', 'little', 'way', 'action', 'scenes', 'many', 'parts', 'move', 'rather', 'slowly', 'could', 'cause', 'people', 'lose', 'attention', 'Also', 'real', 'humor', 'film', 'Fahrenheit', '9/11', 'wit', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'keep', 'viewer', 'entertained', 'documentary', 'serious', 'start', 'finish', 'Mostly', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'very', 'revealing', 'do', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'very', 'well', 'keeping', 'entertainment', 'reasonably', 'high', 'level.Still', 'documentary', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'watch', 'Greenwald', 'done', 'commendable', 'job', 'assembling', 'together', 'important', 'people', 'give', 'take', 'war', 'explaining', 'how', 'came', 'about', 'how', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'world', 'were', 'fooled', 'accepting', 'more', 'intellectual', 'take', 'Iraqi', 'conflict', 'will', 'keep', 'viewers', 'thinking', 'questioning', 'true', 'motives', 'war', 'long', 'documentary', 'end']",N/A

The facts may be true, but they use those facts to paint a warped view of reality to get you to buy what they're selling. Here, they're selling the idea that the Iraq war was unjustified. This movie, financed by MoveOn.org, hits you hard and fast with ... opinions. Not just any one's opinions. These people were highly placed in the U.S.'s various intelligence services. They're just giving you their evaluations. But they've got the credibility so when they speak, you'd better listen. Hard facts are few, but opinions are strung together to make a case that overwhelms you. As other reviewers have noted, it's very hard to absorb and evaluate so many back-to-back opinions thrown at you so quickly. You can't organize them in your mind, even though the movie groups them in categories as it goes along. You can't pause to think, because the next opinion is coming right at you. Such a technique works if it were a couple of opinions in a thirty second political ad, but when strung together in an 84 minute political infomercial, it's overwhelming. Of course, you could just buy the movie and pause it as it goes as you stop to think and piece things together in your mind. So go ahead and buy it here. It's worth it. When the whirlwind of opinions passes, you may well find that this slanted political informercial has in fact proven its case convincingly enough.

853340,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,B0002ZDWGC,Edwin C. Pauzer,"[51, 57]","This DVD reveals the marketing campaign of the Bush administration's goal to go to war with Iraq. They had no reason to until 9/11. But first they had to convince the American people. In other words, they had to lie.First lie: Iraq had weapons of mass destruction (WMD). In a very broad sense WMD's mean chemical and nuclear weapons. But chemical weapons are tactical or battlefied weapons that kill hundreds or even thousands. They also degrade rapidly usually within a matter of months. Then, you see a clip of G.W. telling his audience that Saddam has several hundred tons of chemical agents. There's a clip of Condi Rice saying that the aluminum tubes could only be used to fuel rockets even though our energy department, the UN, and Ambassador Wilson claimed they could not. Next, there's Cheney claiming that Iraq has reconstituted nuclear weapons.Repeatedly we are shown clip after clip of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and Powell claiming that Iraq has WMD capability, claiming that they couldn't wait for the smoking gun to come in the form of a mushroom cloud. This is the nuclear side of DVD which is a strategic application, and will kill millions. When asked if Rumsfeld knew definitely where Iraq was keeping their WMD's, he replied, ""In Tikrit and Baghdad. Somewhere north, south, east or west of there."" That really narrows it down.Second lie: There is a connection between al Quada and Saddam Hussein. This administration wanted us to believe that Saddam would give traceable nuclear material to bin Laden so he could use it against the US. We were supposed to believe that an ultra-control freak, madman and virtual pagan would ally himself with religious fanatic with whom he might have to share power and popularity. Sure! Saddam did support terrorism, which amounted to giving $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers in Israel. There were no terrorist training camps under his control. Period.Third lie: Attempting to paint anyone who disagreed with the administration's policy was a traitor. [...]It is clear from this superb DVD that this administration was ""data mining"" i.e. defining their theory and then looking for any evidence to suppport it, rather than the other way around. Analysts at the CIA who wanted to get ahead began to write their intelligence estimates to suit what they knew the administration wanted. Analysts who said there was no connection were ignored. Vice President Cheney made an unprecedented 29 visits to the CIA between 9/11 and start of hostilities. Did he ever ask, ""Are you certain that Iraq was not involved?"" What would an analyst conclude from that? And why did Rumsfeld suggest hitting Iraq one day after 9/11?There were no aluminum tubes, yellow cake, WMD's, nuclear or chemical. We went to war on a lie alienating our allies, and giving our enemies a reason.Some important questions emerge from this DVD:As the weapons inspector Hans Blix stated: ""How could anyone [the Bush administration] be 100% sure of the existence of WMD's with a zero percent knowledge of where they are?"" Now the neocons claim that these missiles were moved to Syria, but they don't know exactly where. Now, how do you know for sure that something is in one place if you don't know where that place is?If the Israelis knew that Iraq had all these WMD's from chemical to nuclear weapons, wouldn't they have bombed them? Would they have waited for us? The Mossad, perhaps the finest intelligence service in the world, has spies all over the place. They guided Israeli bombs to an Iraqi reactor in 1981. Does anyone believe the Israelis would have sat on their hands?Finally, why did President Bush take us to war when he knew:o  the aluminum tubes were not for missiles or fuel?o  Scud rockets didn't even have the range to get to Europe?o  Ambassador Wilson told him that Iraq was not getting enriched uranimum from Niger?o  the letter from Niger that claimed the uranium deal was being made, was actually a fake?o  the weapons inspectors stated Iraq had no such WMD capability?o  If this president took us to war knowing that their evidence  was a lie or even suspect, isn't that an impeachable offense?Richard Nixon was charged with impeachment for violating his constitutional oath, failing to ensure that our laws were faithfully executed, making false and misleading statements, misuse of the CIA, withholding information from Congress, and deceiving the people of the United States with false and misleading statements.Sound familiar?",5,Impeachment is always an option,1145318400,"04 18,

853341,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B0002ZDWGC,Erik North,"[0, 0]","Revised version of June 12, 2007 Review; Updated November 19, 2011.The incursion into Iraq by the U.S. and the so-called ""Coalition Of The Willing"" that took place on March 19, 2003, and lasted until the late summer of 2011, proved to be one instigated largely on half-truths and out-and-out lying on the part of president George W. Bush, vice-president Dick Cheney, and that entire neoconservative cabal that had America locked in the grip of fear from the moment of 9/11.  The biggest lie of all was that Iraq's dictator Saddam Hussein not only still possessed biological and chemical agents twelve years after the 1991 Gulf War, but that he had a hand in assisting Al Qaeda in the attacks of 9/11 that eviscerated 3,000+ in 102 minutes during that terrible morning in 2001.  By the time these lies were found out, however, the Bush/Cheney regime had locked America onto a course from which, as had been the case with Vietnam, there would be no turning back even if we wanted it.  Just how all of these lies coalesced into such a debacle that it took Bush's successor Barack Obama to extricate us from is told in documentary filmmaker Robert Greenwald's incisive 2004 film UNCOVERED: THE WAR ON IRAQ.Part of a 2003-2004 trilogy known as the ""UN"" series (UNPRECEDENTED: THE 2000 ELECTION; UNCONSTITUTIONAL: THE WAR ON OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES), UNCOVERED, released at a time when documentaries of a decidedly liberal slant were erupting out of all corners to challenge the corporate and military fascism of the Bush/Cheney regime, definitively uncovers a lot of evidence of to what extent they lied in order to ensnare us into a conflict that neither gave us revenge for 9/11, nor enhanced national security.  It was very well known by United Nations weapons inspectors for several years that Saddam Hussein, as evil and despicable a despot as there has been since the days of Hitler and Stalin, had had his stockpile of ""weapons of mass destruction"" expunged from existence long after the last shots had been fired in the 1991 war.  In essence, he was basically impotent...at least until 9/11, when Bush and his minions used the attacks to make it seem like he had suddenly become a direct threat to America.  As such, a nation living in fear of being attacked in far worse ways than big jets smashing into buildings placed their trust in a regime where most of the participants, draft dodgers Bush and Cheney especially, had little or no foreign policy acumen, but plenty of misplaced ideologies.  To expose these facts, much as Ed Murrow had done with respect to senator Joseph McCarthy's Gestapo tactics at ""exposing"" Communists during the 1950s ""Red Scare"", Greenwald utilizes archival footage of Bush, Cheney, et al, to indict them all; and, as Michael Moore would do in FAHRENHEIT 9/11, he also shows us footage of Donald Rumsfeld having shaken hands with Hussein on a visit to Iraq in 1983, at a time when Hussein was still America's ""friend"", and undergoing their own war against the evil Islamist dictatorship next door in Iran.Adding to this, we also get a whole nest of interviews with people like UN weapons inspectors Scott Ritter and Hans Blix, who had done on-the-ground inspections in Iraq for seven years, and, while they ran into Hussein's stonewalling on any number of occasions, were able to ensure in the end that the Iraqi dictator couldn't use any WMDs on his people or his neighbors; government analysts like Larry Johnson, Chas Freeman, and Ray McGovern, who give very damning assessments of the Bush/Cheney rationale; former ambassador Joe Wilson, who exposed Bush's claims that Iraq was importing yellowcake uranium from Niger as false and saw his CIA agent wife Valerie Plame get exposed as retaliation; and, last but not least, a man who is no stranger to world-class lying, former Nixon special counsel John Dean, who speculates that the amount of lies being told about the war in Iraq by Bush himself could very well have warranted direct impeachment proceedings.  This is extremely heavy stuff to take in, and UNCOVERED does it in less than ninety minutes.Like so many responses to the Bush/Cheney line that came following the 2003 incursion, UNCOVERED was made the target of the administration and its minions on the Far Right on Fox News, talk radio, and the blogosphere.  In the end, however, the truth so smothered the attacks that such a backlash was inevitable; and by the time 2007 rolled around, Iraq was a shambles.  Greenwald, even with his very liberal political credentials, was only exposing what the Bush/Cheney junta wanted to keep a permanent secret from the American public.  And when all is said and done, while Bush/Cheney will almost certainly be considered the most corrupt presidential administration after Nixon's, Greenwald, and other truth tellers and whistleblowers like him, be they liberal or conservative, will come out the big winners, as will, with any luck, the American people as well.",5,A 21st Century Deception Writ Large,1181606400,"06 12,

853342,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0002ZDWGC,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[12, 16]","Director Robert Greenwald's ""Uncovered - The War On Iraq"" chronicles the Bush Administration's case to invade Iraq following the events of Sept. 11, 2001. The film analyzes, and demolishes, the administration's arguments for war through interviews with high level experts and professionals from the Central Intelligence Agency, the US State Department, the US military, congress, as well as weapons analysts and inspectors.I am extremely impressed with the quality of information proffered in the film. Over 20 experts, with informed opinions and facts, provide outstanding testimony. It is extremely disturbing to listen to these declarations, no matter what one's political affiliation. We are all Americans when it comes down to it, and we all want what is best for our country. However, the American people have a right to the truth. We have a right to make decisions based on sound information before we send our sons and daughters off to war. As taxpayers, we also have a right to receive a fair approximation of the amount of money to be spent on said war.Greenwald works with two stories here. The first is the one told to the American people by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Condee Rice, etc., in the State of the Union speeches, the president's and Secretary Powell's speeches before the United Nations, and in several press conferences and interviews. The administration's story is reconstructed through stock footage. The second story, and the other side of the coin, is told by the interviewees mentioned above, based on their first hand experience. Impeccable sources, all with records of outstanding service, bear witness here. They are united in their message, which is - from start to finish, the Bush administration's war effort was built on calculated lies. They detail the lies, misstatements and exaggerations that served as the reasons to launch a ""preemptive"" strike and begin the Iraqi war. The documentary offers an in-depth look at the distortion of intelligence and the ""spin"" presented to the American people and to the Congress.It is also pointed out, and startling to note in retrospect, how the administration's story and rational has changed over a two year period. The public is told now that our preemptive strike, and subsequent invasion of a sovereign foreign country, was to bring down a tyrant and to liberate a people. Two years ago we were told that we were stopping an imminent threat to the world from weapons of mass destruction.The press is taken to task for neglecting to do its job before the war began. They apparently never asked the tough questions, like the ones asked by those who participate in the movie. Scott Ritter, former U. N. weapons inspector, was actually ridiculed by Paula Zahn, (the clip is shown), and other members of the media because he was one of the first who insisted on the absence of WMD.While I am impressed with the documentary's content, I am disappointed with the quality of the film. The production lacks professionalism. The film is spliced in an amateur fashion, making for extremely choppy viewing, and the editing and camera work are poor in many instances. The talking head quotes, taken directly from newspaper headlines, appear tabloid in nature, which really undermines the seriousness of the testimony. And the quotes are accompanied by drum rolls, and overly dramatic music. The speakers' testimonies and levels of expertise are dramatic in and of themselves. There was no need to undermine a class act by embellishing. I am sorry if I sound overly picky, but as a reviewer I would be remiss if I did not mention these distractions. I understand this documentary was put together rapidly and I admire everyone's resolve to get it before the public ASAP. I just cannot help but wish for a finer work product. That said, I am extremely glad the documentary was made and is now available to all.One of the interviewees quotes Mark Twain in the film, when discussing his own responsibilities as a patriotic citizen. Mr. Twain once said, """"Patriotism means supporting one's country whatever. And the government when it deserves it.""JANA",4,Film Demolishes Bush Administration's Sales Pitch For War!,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,4162,"['Director', 'Robert', 'Greenwald', 'Uncovered', 'War', 'Iraq', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'case', 'invade', 'Iraq', 'following', 'events', 'Sept.', '11', '2001', 'film', 'demolishes', 'administration', 'arguments', 'war', 'interviews', 'high', 'level', 'experts', 'professionals', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'US', 'State', 'Department', 'US', 'military', 'congress', 'as', 'well', 'weapons', 'analysts', 'inspectors.I', 'am', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'quality', 'information', 'proffered', 'film', '20', 'experts', 'informed', 'opinions', 'facts', 'provide', 'outstanding', 'testimony', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'listen', 'declarations', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'political', 'affiliation', 'are', 'Americans', 'when', 'down', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'country', 'However', 'American', 'people', 'have', 'right', 'truth', 'have', 'right', 'make', 'decisions', 'based', 'sound', 'information', 'send', 'sons', 'daughters', 'war', 'taxpayers', 'also', 'have', 'right', 'receive', 'fair', 'approximation', 'amount', 'money', 'be', 'spent', 'said', 'war.Greenwald', 'works', 'two', 'stories', 'here', 'first', 'one', 'told', 'American', 'people', 'President', 'Bush', 'Vice', 'President', 'Cheney', 'Secretary', 'Rumsfeld', 'Colin', 'Powell', 'Condee', 'Rice', 'etc.', 'State', 'Union', 'speeches', 'president', 'Secretary', 'Powell', 'speeches', 'United', 'Nations', 'several', 'press', 'conferences', 'interviews', 'administration', 'story', 'reconstructed', 'stock', 'footage', 'second', 'story', 'other', 'side', 'coin', 'told', 'interviewees', 'mentioned', 'based', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'Impeccable', 'sources', 'records', 'outstanding', 'service', 'bear', 'witness', 'here', 'are', 'united', 'message', 'start', 'finish', 'Bush', 'administration', 'war', 'effort', 'was', 'built', 'calculated', 'lies', 'detail', 'lies', 'misstatements', 'exaggerations', 'served', 'reasons', 'launch', 'preemptive', 'strike', 'begin', 'Iraqi', 'war', 'documentary', 'offers', 'in-depth', 'look', 'distortion', 'intelligence', 'spin', 'presented', 'American', 'people', 'Congress.It', 'also', 'pointed', 'out', 'startling', 'note', 'retrospect', 'how', 'administration', 'story', 'rational', 'changed', 'two', 'year', 'period', 'public', 'told', 'now', 'preemptive', 'strike', 'subsequent', 'invasion', 'sovereign', 'foreign', 'country', 'was', 'bring', 'down', 'tyrant', 'liberate', 'people', 'Two', 'years', 'were', 'told', 'were', 'stopping', 'imminent', 'threat', 'world', 'weapons', 'mass', 'destruction.The', 'press', 'taken', 'task', 'neglecting', 'do', 'job', 'war', 'began', 'apparently', 'never', 'asked', 'tough', 'questions', 'ones', 'asked', 'who', 'participate', 'movie', 'Scott', 'Ritter', 'former', 'U.', 'N.', 'weapons', 'inspector', 'was', 'actually', 'ridiculed', 'Paula', 'Zahn', 'clip', 'shown', 'other', 'members', 'media', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'who', 'insisted', 'absence', 'WMD.While', 'am', 'impressed', 'documentary', 'content', 'am', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'film', 'production', 'professionalism', 'film', 'spliced', 'amateur', 'fashion', 'making', 'extremely', 'choppy', 'viewing', 'editing', 'camera', 'work', 'are', 'poor', 'many', 'instances', 'talking', 'head', 'quotes', 'taken', 'directly', 'newspaper', 'headlines', 'appear', 'tabloid', 'nature', 'really', 'seriousness', 'testimony', 'quotes', 'are', 'accompanied', 'drum', 'rolls', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'music', 'speakers', 'testimonies', 'levels', 'expertise', 'are', 'dramatic', 'was', 'need', 'undermine', 'class', 'act', 'embellishing', 'am', 'sorry', 'sound', 'overly', 'picky', 'reviewer', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'did', 'not', 'mention', 'distractions', 'understand', 'documentary', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'rapidly', 'admire', 'everyone', 'resolve', 'get', 'public', 'ASAP', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wish', 'finer', 'work', 'product', 'said', 'am', 'extremely', 'glad', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'now', 'available', 'all.One', 'interviewees', 'Mark', 'Twain', 'film', 'when', 'discussing', 'own', 'responsibilities', 'patriotic', 'citizen', 'Mr', 'Twain', 'once', 'said', 'Patriotism', 'supporting', 'one', 'country', 'whatever', 'government', 'when', 'JANA']",N/A
853343,A3GYVMUS7SSDFW,B0002ZDWGC,Kyle Tolle,"[11, 15]","To begin with, a nice approach by the producer was to introduce a long list of expert witnesses with decades of combined experience in intelligence, foreign service, and other fields that make up a bulk of testimony in the program.  This really sets the tone for credibility when uncovering all the facts and shows that there is still integrity left in the world.  As stated in the program at one point, part of being a patriot is not being afraid to tell the truth despite the consequences of doing so.There is little speculation anymore about September 11, 2001 being the catalyst for war on Iraq and the war on terror.  For getting us into Iraq, we have to lay the burden of proof (or guilt) on our government and their  dubious methods of sending dire messages of danger that were never really there.  It started out with WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) and gravitated toward terrorism at a later time.  It is quite interesting to watch the video footage showing the government contradicting themselves before and after 9-11 using the evidence they fabricated, manipulated, and doctored to transfix a populace and justify an invasion.  Using a National Intelligence Estimate employing questionable tactics such as `selective intelligence' and `data mining', these  and other methods were used to help convince the bureaucracy that our presence in Iraq was absolutely necessary.  Broken down into simple terms, there just wasn't any concrete evidence of chemical, nuclear, or biological weapons, the systems to deliver these weapons, and no facilities or materials to even construct these devices.  There is basically no evidence anywhere that showed any serious attempts to question or investigate the spurious allegations of our government, defectors, or intelligence data during this time period.Moving further along, it was the position of our government that terrorism played another vital role for reasons to occupy Iraq.  First, it was for the part they played in the World Trade Center attacks (Iraq has subsequently been shown not to have been involved) and their link to Osama Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda terrorist network (again, Iraq was not identified as having had any dealings at that time with him or them).  Once again, it is demonstrated that our government is comfortable with being deceptive with the public and the 'official' facts and data proving these allegations are non-existent for all intents and purposes.`Uncovered: The War on Iraq' is actually an updated version of an earlier documentary remade with about 30 minutes of new footage.  I've only seen this latest version myself but it is more than enough to leave a lasting impact on me.  I feel this program was well produced and presented and the messages contained within are very important and necessary.  In addition to a few special features, there is an added segment of 35 minutes called Soldier's Pay.  This is an enlightening series of interviews with several individuals regarding their antiwar issues.  For those interested in this DVD, another excellent choice exploring similar issues is `On Native Soil'.  I highly recommend both of these documentaries to everyone.",5,"And now, for the real story behind it all",1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,3164,"['begin', 'nice', 'approach', 'producer', 'was', 'introduce', 'long', 'list', 'expert', 'witnesses', 'decades', 'combined', 'experience', 'intelligence', 'foreign', 'service', 'other', 'fields', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'testimony', 'program', 'really', 'tone', 'credibility', 'when', 'uncovering', 'facts', 'still', 'integrity', 'left', 'world', 'stated', 'program', 'one', 'point', 'part', 'being', 'patriot', 'not', 'being', 'afraid', 'tell', 'truth', 'consequences', 'doing', 'little', 'speculation', 'anymore', 'September', '11', '2001', 'being', 'catalyst', 'war', 'Iraq', 'war', 'terror', 'getting', 'Iraq', 'have', 'lay', 'burden', 'proof', 'guilt', 'government', 'dubious', 'methods', 'sending', 'dire', 'messages', 'danger', 'were', 'never', 'really', 'there', 'started', 'out', 'WMD', 'Weapons', 'Mass', 'Destruction', 'gravitated', 'terrorism', 'later', 'time', 'quite', 'interesting', 'watch', 'video', 'footage', 'showing', 'government', 'contradicting', '9-11', 'using', 'evidence', 'fabricated', 'manipulated', 'doctored', 'transfix', 'populace', 'justify', 'invasion', 'Using', 'National', 'Intelligence', 'Estimate', 'employing', 'questionable', 'tactics', 'such', 'selective', 'intelligence', 'data', 'mining', 'other', 'methods', 'were', 'used', 'help', 'convince', 'bureaucracy', 'presence', 'Iraq', 'was', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'Broken', 'down', 'simple', 'terms', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'concrete', 'evidence', 'chemical', 'nuclear', 'biological', 'weapons', 'systems', 'deliver', 'weapons', 'facilities', 'materials', 'even', 'construct', 'devices', 'basically', 'evidence', 'anywhere', 'showed', 'serious', 'attempts', 'question', 'investigate', 'spurious', 'allegations', 'government', 'defectors', 'intelligence', 'data', 'time', 'period.Moving', 'further', 'along', 'was', 'position', 'government', 'terrorism', 'played', 'vital', 'role', 'reasons', 'occupy', 'Iraq', 'First', 'was', 'part', 'played', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'attacks', 'Iraq', 'subsequently', 'been', 'shown', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'involved', 'link', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'Al-Qaeda', 'terrorist', 'network', 'again', 'Iraq', 'was', 'not', 'identified', 'having', 'had', 'dealings', 'time', 'Once', 'again', 'demonstrated', 'government', 'comfortable', 'being', 'deceptive', 'public', ""'official"", 'facts', 'data', 'proving', 'allegations', 'are', 'non-existent', 'intents', 'purposes.', 'Uncovered', 'War', 'Iraq', 'actually', 'updated', 'version', 'earlier', 'documentary', 'remade', '30', 'minutes', 'new', 'footage', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'latest', 'version', 'more', 'enough', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impact', 'feel', 'program', 'was', 'well', 'produced', 'presented', 'messages', 'contained', 'are', 'very', 'important', 'necessary', 'addition', 'few', 'special', 'features', 'added', 'segment', '35', 'minutes', 'called', 'Soldier', 'Pay', 'enlightening', 'series', 'interviews', 'several', 'individuals', 'regarding', 'antiwar', 'issues', 'interested', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'choice', 'exploring', 'similar', 'issues', 'Native', 'Soil', 'highly', 'recommend', 'documentaries', 'everyone']",N/A
853344,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0002ZDWGC,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 8]","In the wake of ""Fahrenheit 9/11""s phenomenal box office success, a flurry of similarly-themed documentaries hit movie theatres in late 2004, all making the case that the Bush administration's war against Iraq was ill-advised, opportunistic and based on intelligence and evidence that turned out to be, at best, faulty, and, at worst, deceptive and manipulated.  ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq,"" produced by the liberal organization MoveOn.org., is one such documentary.  The preposition used in the title - ""on"" as opposed to ""in"" - reveals right up front the political leanings of those who made the movie.The basic thesis of the film is that the neo-cons in the Bush administration had decided, even before 9/11, that the U.S. would eventually have go to war against Iraq to overthrow the Saddam Hussein regime.  9/11 merely provided them with the pretext they needed to sell the idea to the American public.  By painting Iraq as a viable terrorist threat, the Bush administration was able to win over Congress and the nation's people to their cause, resulting in a war that is entering its third year now, having already cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.The film does an impressive job of what opponents would call ""Monday morning quarterbacking,"" juxtaposing comments made by members of the Bush administration before the war with current statements by mainly key CIA and former CIA officials about what we know now.  Through a series of largely familiar news clips, we see Bush, Condaleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and others all lining up to present the case for war against Iraq by arguing that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, harbored terrorists within his nation's borders, and had known links with the Al Qaeda operatives who perpetrated the attacks on 9/11 - all ""facts"" we now know to have been either woefully unsubstantiated or completely fabricated.  The movie includes interviews with Joe Wilson, the ambassador whose wife was ""outed"" as a CIA operative by a member of the Bush administration when Wilson publicly questioned the validity of some of the ""evidence"" being touted around town that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons.  Another key figure in the movie is weapons inspector David Kay, who is given ample screen time to declare his mea culpas for initially supporting the Bush administration's assertions that WMD's would ultimately be found once U.S. forces had invaded and subdued the country.The film also takes aim at the American news media for allowing itself to be essentially co-opted by the neo-cons in the run-up to the war.  Rather than challenging the White House's spin as it should have, the media, according to the filmmakers, simply went along with what it was being told by the Bush administration, thereby failing to fulfill its function as the independent Fourth Estate.  It became, essentially, complicit in misleading the American public - a scandalous dereliction of duty which should concern patriotic citizens on both sides of the political spectrum.""Uncovered"" doesn't pretend to offer a ""fair and balanced"" view of the events leading up to the Iraq War; it doesn't offer opposing viewpoints or interview people from the other side of the political equation.  As a result, it opens itself up to charges from the Right that it is every bit as propagandistic as the administration it is attacking.  Yet, the fact remains that those on the Left, who opposed the war and questioned the administration's motives even before the conflict started, turned out to be largely correct in their assessment of the facts.  And the film makes a compelling case that the people who were labeled ""unpatriotic"" and ""un-American"" before the war for daring to raise these objections may actually have been the most patriotic and pro-American people of all.""Uncovered"" is, essentially, a talking heads documentary, but one that will have you shaking your own head (or pulling your hair out) in dismay and frustration - especially when one considers how astonishingly blas&eacute; and indifferent the American public seems to be about the whole thing.Barbara Tuchman, in her book ""The March of Folly,"" writes that, ""Wooden headedness, the source of self deception, is a factor that plays a remarkably large role in government. It consists in assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring any contrary signs. It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be deflected by the facts. It is epitomized in a historian's statement about Phillip II of Spain, the surpassing woodenheaded of all sovereigns: `No experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence.'""In the case of  the Bush administration and the Iraq War, truer words were never spoken.",4,one-sided but eye-opening documentary,1112918400,"04 8, 2005",2005,4845,"['wake',
