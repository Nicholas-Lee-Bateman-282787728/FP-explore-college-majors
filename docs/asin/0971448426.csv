The cast, (I can't bring myself to call them actors,) is uniformly atrocious. These people are either good friends of the producer or they paid him big bucks to cast them. It is inconceivable that any of them were cast after an audition. Technically, the cinematography and sound are so bad that it looks like somebody's first attempt at trying out their new video camera. The script is non-existent. There is no story, just a seemingly endless series of scenes between the untalented non-actors. There is no attempt whatsoever to tell a story or maintain any sense of continuity. I wish I could say something positive about this movie. Unfortunately there is nothing good to say. It's a total zero from start to finish,",1,One of the worst I have ever seen.,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",2004,845,"['Somebody', 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'worst', 'attempt', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'How', 'ever', 'got', 'produced', 'cast', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'call', 'actors', 'uniformly', 'atrocious', 'people', 'are', 'either', 'good', 'friends', 'producer', 'paid', 'big', 'bucks', 'cast', 'inconceivable', 'were', 'cast', 'audition', 'Technically', 'cinematography', 'sound', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'somebody', 'first', 'attempt', 'trying', 'out', 'new', 'video', 'camera', 'script', 'non-existent', 'story', 'just', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'series', 'scenes', 'untalented', 'non-actors', 'attempt', 'whatsoever', 'tell', 'story', 'maintain', 'sense', 'continuity', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'something', 'positive', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'nothing', 'good', 'say', 'total', 'zero', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

Balmes,"[11, 11]","Though I'm a fan of independent films; GODS OF OLYMPIA cannot even be classed as such, unless you include someone who went to an electronics store and bought a video camera, and along with some of his friends,thought they could make a movie with it. The acting, editing, cimematography, screenplay etc., was all amateurish and subpar. The scenes don't flow naturaly from one into the other, and in one, you hear someone off camera giving one of the actors his lines he forgot say,There are a couple of nude-sex scenes that have nothing in common with the story line; same with several segments of people talking amongst themselves in the gay eatery which the films story is centered around. The story take place in Olympia Washington (only 60 miles from where I live) the characters includes a supreme court justice who dresses up in drag and is running for empress of the local emperal(gay drag gueen)court;and the Lt. govenor who is just comming out; and neither actor is convicing in there respectable roles; a homeless man (who's european accent is so pronounced that it is difficult to understand what he is saying half of the time) who is befriended by the waiter and and a relationship then developes (at least this sex scene makes some sense), a dishwasher who falls in love with the Lt. governor; and the cook who inherits the resturant. I choose not to go into detail more of the story for those of you who have not yet seen this filmI wish I could find some redeeming qualities for this production, but there are few to none. Don't pay full price for this dvd ( you will thank me later) unless you want to know what a bad gay film is like and want to add one to your collection. I'm sure the people involved in this production made an earnest and sincere effort to produce a good movie, they just didn't pull it off",1,"more like "" this film is in need of a God""",1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,1826,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'independent', 'films', 'GODS', 'OLYMPIA', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'classed', 'such', 'include', 'someone', 'who', 'went', 'electronics', 'store', 'bought', 'video', 'camera', 'friends', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'acting', 'editing', 'cimematography', 'screenplay', 'etc.', 'was', 'amateurish', 'subpar', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'naturaly', 'one', 'other', 'one', 'hear', 'someone', 'camera', 'giving', 'one', 'actors', 'lines', 'forgot', 'say', 'are', 'couple', 'nude-sex', 'scenes', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'story', 'line', 'same', 'several', 'segments', 'people', 'talking', 'amongst', 'gay', 'eatery', 'films', 'story', 'centered', 'story', 'take', 'place', 'Olympia', 'Washington', 'only', '60', 'miles', 'where', 'live', 'characters', 'supreme', 'court', 'justice', 'who', 'up', 'drag', 'running', 'empress', 'local', 'emperal', 'gay', 'drag', 'gueen', 'court', 'Lt.', 'govenor', 'who', 'just', 'comming', 'out', 'actor', 'convicing', 'respectable', 'roles', 'homeless', 'man', 'who', 'european', 'accent', 'so', 'pronounced', 'difficult', 'understand', 'what', 'saying', 'half', 'time', 'who', 'befriended', 'waiter', 'relationship', 'then', 'least', 'sex', 'scene', 'sense', 'dishwasher', 'who', 'love', 'Lt.', 'governor', 'cook', 'who', 'resturant', 'choose', 'not', 'go', 'detail', 'more', 'story', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'filmI', 'wish', 'could', 'find', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'production', 'are', 'few', 'none', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'dvd', 'will', 'thank', 'later', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'bad', 'gay', 'film', 'want', 'add', 'one', 'collection', ""'m"", 'sure', 'people', 'involved', 'production', 'made', 'earnest', 'sincere', 'effort', 'produce', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off']",N/A

In fact none of the sex had a context or story line that lead up to it and it was without emotion such as love or any romance. This was a poor investment.
