She has a wonderful delivery about her which is why I can see why her students rave about her and about yoga in general. The segments are divided up into 4 and 3 Bonuses at the end. I especially like that Parts 1 and 2 (upper and lower body exercises) are done sitting in a chair as I have trouble with balance. These exercises are great for my shoulders, neck and back. Part 3 gives me a great workout on my hips and legs and I always look forward to the relaxation and meditation at the end.The Bonus features are cool, too. My favorite is the Bounce and Shake. That one wakes me up and gets me going in the morning. I also enjoy listening to Peggy's students rave about her and about what yoga has done for them.The exercises are great for easing my fibromyalgia and back pain.
