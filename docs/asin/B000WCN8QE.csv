As someone who has never gotten high and never tried pot, I didn't think I would relate to this film. Surprisingly though, I found this movie hilarious and spot on. It's particularly accurate in its portrayal of the typical American college graduate 20-something. No, not all 20-something sit around at home collecting unemployment and smoking from a bong, but many are feeling isolated, paranoid, and altogether confused and scared about joining the ""real world."" This film manages to deliver the story in a very jumpy manner, alternating between flashbacks, playbacks, foreshadowing, voiceovers, and imaginary scenes. Yet, it somehow makes the drugged-out feeling more accurate, more legitimate.At the end of the day, this film only works because Anna Faris delivers her lines with believability and aplomb and superior comedic talent than she's illustrated before.",4,"not for everyone, but quite entertatining for those who get it",1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,945,"[""'ll"", 'admit', 'deciding', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'difficult', 'someone', 'who', 'never', 'gotten', 'high', 'never', 'tried', 'pot', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'relate', 'film', 'Surprisingly', 'found', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'spot', 'particularly', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'typical', 'American', 'college', 'graduate', '20-something', 'No', 'not', '20-something', 'sit', 'home', 'collecting', 'unemployment', 'smoking', 'bong', 'many', 'are', 'feeling', 'isolated', 'paranoid', 'altogether', 'confused', 'scared', 'joining', 'real', 'world', 'film', 'deliver', 'story', 'very', 'jumpy', 'manner', 'alternating', 'flashbacks', 'playbacks', 'foreshadowing', 'voiceovers', 'imaginary', 'scenes', 'Yet', 'somehow', 'drugged-out', 'feeling', 'more', 'accurate', 'more', 'end', 'day', 'film', 'only', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'lines', 'believability', 'aplomb', 'superior', 'comedic', 'talent', 'illustrated', 'before']",N/A
1108768,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000WCN8QE,B. E Jackson,"[2, 3]","It's pretty darn scary just how *accurately* Smiley Face portrays the troubled life of a pothead.  It's about a blonde-haired teenage girl who spends every single moment of an adventurous day totally drugged out and we, the viewers, get to see what it's like watching ordinary everyday people attempt to interact with her.  It's aggravating!However in the land of movies, I can't help but admire the fantastic storyline.  I also can't help but notice that a movie like this *needs* to exist.  It needs to exist to hopefully show potheads just what kind of life they're living and how it affects the people around them.Anyway the storyline is about a drugged out girl who has no ambition and nothing to really look forward to except doing pot, so she gets stuck in an adventure where one thing after another goes terribly wrong.  First she realizes that if she doesn't pay a drug dealer the amount they're asking for, they'll come to her apartment and take her furniture.  Then she tries to audition for an actress position that a friend sticks his neck out for.  Then she finds the phone number of a boy who has a crush on her and they find themselves at the dentists office.  Then she finds herself running from the cops.  Then she finds herself lost and confused in a traffic jam.  Then she finds herself stuck on a carnival ride.  How does all this happen, you ask?  One thing leads to another!I have to admit, the writing and the acting abilities of Anna Faris is spot-on accurate, and I was definitely entertained.  Great film.

She's toking on her water pipe when she's left a note by her psycho roommate not to eat the cupcakes he made for his comic-con buddies.  Munchies trump common sense and Jane gorges every cupcake which turn out to be laced with cannabis.  This sets off a chain of events.  She must get the money for her dealer for her back debts or he'll confiscate her beloved bed.  In the process she has to elude police, a Marxist professor who she stole the manuscript for ""The Communist Manifesto"" from and his prim mother (Marion Ross from ""Happy Days"") as well as her roomates' dorky buddy(John Krasinski).

1108775,A1URWB7HMON61C,B000WCN8QE,dra,"[0, 0]","What I am about to reveal may shock no one. A while back, I found this film on Amazon, and the conjunction of Anna Faris, 1990s art-house director Gregg Araki and stoner comedy seemed irresistible. I therefore exchanged money for the DVD, in the expectation of some kind of upscale distaff Harold and Kumar, starring the actress I once unironically likened to a young Goldie Hawn.39 minutes into this 85 minute movie, I could watch no more. There are very few jokes, and those mostly of the ""oh, look, she's burning the dope butter"" variety (I did smirk when Faris threw her phone at the smoke detector, the phone fell into the charred butter, and she tried to continue her conversation, which shows how desperate I was). The funniest moment came when I remarked, ""This is surprisingly bad,"" which led to my wife having convulsions of laughter on the floor.As much as I can comment on Araki's directorial contribution, it consisted of closely detailed reenactments of the gestures and facial expressions of the colossally stoned, alternating with crude pratfalls. I presume his reputation is based on something more than this.There are cameos by Jane Lynch, John Krasinski, the timid student counsellor from Glee and the principal from Community. If I had to guess, I'd say they'd left this film on their CVs as a sobering reminder of the terrible stuff they had to do before they were famous.The soundtrack was surprisingly strong, with Scissor Sisters' Filthy/Gorgeous, Talking Heads Memories Can't Wait, REO Speedwagon's Keep On Loving You, and another song I was pleased to recognise, but cannot tell you about, because to do so would involve going back to watch the scene in question a second time.What have I learned? 1. Bad films are bad, and the time for deriving ironic pleasure from them passed some time before I had children or had less time to live than I have lived already. 2. I may have to give up on the stoner comedy. 3. Some people know ideas to be bad simply from contemplation, some people just don't get it until they try it and find out for themselves.

Those other virtures include solid direction, exceptional art direction and lighting, and an overall bloom on the production.Written in a format mimicking -- and highly infulenced by -- television'sSeinfeld, this movie is less a story told than a collective of individual events and circumstances one might find in a 90-minute version of the great comedy that appeared on NBC during the 1990s. And, like any 90 minute version of ""Seinfeld"" would certainly be, this film is very funny, engaging, and totally unpredictable.Anne, the heroine, is a stoner, a California college graduate and actress whose life revolves around getting a buzz. She lives in a suburban apartment with a platonic male roommate and has multiple adventures in this 90-minute comedy. Among those are blowing the utility payment on grass, going a trip to the dentist with a pal, an interlude with police, and getting her hands on the original copy of the Marx-Lenin Ccommunist Manifesto. She does all this while stoned and often hallucinating.If this sounds like a riot, that's becuase it is. This film, which has a plot thinner than a piece of bathroom tissue, manages to engage its viewers all 90 minutes by moving quickly between episodes in this poor girl's life and using unusual camera angles, art renderings that often speak to her, and a lively script. The art direction, in particular, is both highly effective and very imaginative. I wouldn't call this film unique in image manaagement but it is most unusual. To add another bit of individuality, the film focuses on a female slacker, a species pretty much unheard of in mainstream Hollywood.If you enjoy contemporary urban comedy, you will almost certainly like this movie. If that's you, buy, rent, borrow or steal this film for some fun tonight.

If she chose this role...bad, bad move! If her agent chose this role...hire a new agent!I'm going to go out on a limb here to say that Anna has probably never been stoned in her life. She doesn't even act like a stoner acts. First of all, people who are stoned don't spend the entire high with their mouths open. Second of all, people who are stoned are usually so paranoid, they wouldn't even think to try to sell weed to a stranger right off the cuff. Thirdly, people who are stoned don't stagger around like they are alcoholic drunks.
