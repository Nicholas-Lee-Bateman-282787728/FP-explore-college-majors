Dunst is not a spectacular actress like everyone thinks she is, she's not sexy whatsoever, she tries really hard to be in this film, flashing her navel and parading around in her underwear. Hernandez on the other and is a cutiepie and an ok actor. Dunst's character Nicole is mentally-disturbed and her love for Carlos is threatened when her dad (Bruce Davidson) tries to end their relationship. He is from the wrong side of the tracks, just the same old, boring formula used in practically every film. Nothing engaging here, I'd pass on this teen drama.",2,Not a beautiful movie.,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,706,"['did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Crazy/Beautiful', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'totally', 'over-rated', 'was', 'passion', 'just', 'two', 'teens', 'eachother', 'Dunst', 'not', 'spectacular', 'actress', 'everyone', 'not', 'sexy', 'whatsoever', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'film', 'flashing', 'navel', 'parading', 'around', 'underwear', 'Hernandez', 'other', 'cutiepie', 'ok', 'actor', 'Dunst', 'character', 'Nicole', 'mentally-disturbed', 'love', 'Carlos', 'threatened', 'when', 'dad', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'end', 'relationship', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'boring', 'formula', 'used', 'practically', 'film', 'Nothing', 'engaging', 'here', ""'d"", 'pass', 'teen', 'drama']",Crazy/ Beautiful

However, this movie has no passion, nothing to make me see how these two fell in love, and no ""ah"" factor. It simply involved a girl who drank, used drugs, and was out of control and a boy who was a real straight arrow. Unlike most films the rich and White female was the one out of control (in more ways than one) while the poor and minority male was the straight arrow- refreshing. Yet this is where the refreshness ends. While most of these type of movies have two opposites falling for each other in this case they were two polar opposites and their ""love"" seemed shallow- based on teenage hormones that ran rampant on both ends (though more so on hers.) Don't waste ur money. By the way I gave this film a two because I was about to turn it off when it got better though did not exceed much- therefore I give the first third a 1 and the rest a 3. Don't waste ur money- if you can get it for free or on Encore (where I saw it) and you have the time to waste (like I did) then go ahead.",2,Not the typical teen love movie in many ways,1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1221,"['So', 'am', 'mid', 'twenties', 'still', 'love', 'most', 'teeny', 'movies-', 'actually', 'not', 'still-', 'hated', 'when', 'was', 'Teen', 'really', 'enjoy', 'now', 'full', 'sweet', 'clean', 'cut', 'even', 'when', 'sex', 'love', 'However', 'movie', 'passion', 'nothing', 'make', 'see', 'how', 'two', 'fell', 'love', 'ah', 'factor', 'simply', 'involved', 'girl', 'who', 'used', 'drugs', 'was', 'control', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'straight', 'arrow', 'most', 'films', 'rich', 'White', 'female', 'was', 'one', 'control', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'poor', 'minority', 'male', 'was', 'straight', 'arrow-', 'refreshing', 'where', 'refreshness', 'most', 'type', 'movies', 'have', 'two', 'opposites', 'falling', 'other', 'case', 'were', 'two', 'polar', 'opposites', 'love', 'seemed', 'shallow-', 'based', 'teenage', 'hormones', 'ran', 'rampant', 'ends', 'more', 'so', 'hers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'ur', 'money', 'way', 'gave', 'film', 'two', 'was', 'turn', 'off', 'when', 'got', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'exceed', 'much-', 'therefore', 'give', 'first', '1', 'rest', '3', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'ur', 'money-', 'can', 'get', 'free', 'Encore', 'where', 'saw', 'have', 'time', 'waste', 'did', 'then', 'go', 'ahead']",Crazy/ Beautiful

It's a fairly typical poor kid falls in love with rich kid movie with the usual difficulties such a relationship would bring.

543105,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CY5P,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I've always been an advocate for Kirsten Dunst.  I feel she's a brilliantly talented actress who chooses challenging and engaging roles for herself.  She shines in just about everything and continues to impress me with each selected performance.  That said, I was forced to see this movie.  It just looked to me like another in a long line of recycled and regurgitated teen love stories that plays out the same way and never initiates any real care or concern on the part of the audience.  I did however see this film, in the theater at that, and have to say that by the films end I was in complete shock.  `Crazy/Beautiful' is a genuinely great film, from the script to the acting to the films execution.  While the subject material may appear like `Romeo & Juliet' light, it veers enough from its pre-chosen path to establish originality and demand rewatchability.`Crazy/Beautiful' casts Dunst as trouble child Nicole, a misunderstood daughter of a wealthy congressman who battles her stepmother every step of the way and vies for attention through one screw up after another.  She doesn't take anything serious, not school, not boys, not anything but then she by chance meets Carlos, a boy who is her complete opposite.  Carlos studies hard, gets up extra early to travel a long distance to attend a good school so he can make something of himself.  He takes everything seriously, that is until he meets Nicole.  Their relationship is explosive and, according to their families, dangerous.  Nicole's father even pleads with Carlos to stay far away from his daughter, not because he's concerned for her well being but because he's concerned for Carlos, fearing that Nicole with ruin him.  It's in these small changes that `Crazy/Beautiful' distinguishes itself apart from the other fluff.As the film progresses we can see the relationship between the two of them bend and break only to reform stronger than before.  It's actually a realistic look at teenage relationships today.  Of course it's dramatized for Hollywood but if you really take a second to analyze what you're watching you'll see that it all rings forth very true.  Nicole is far from a bad child, just a misunderstood one who craves love and attention she's not receiving from those who should be handing it out to her unconditionally.  What I love most about this film is that instead of really painting Nicole's father and stepmother as downright evil they are portrayed realistically, as confused adults who have no idea how to handle someone they feel is bucking them constantly.  As much as the audience is persuaded to hate the stepmother I feel that in the end she's given credibility.  This is a film that exposes the faults of all parties involved.What really drives this film home is the powerful performance given by Kirsten Dunst.  She's amazing here, giving so much genuine emotion, investing so much heart into Nicole that she breathes to life before us.  Dunst is effective throughout, but scenes like her drunken breakdown at the feet of her father are especially effective, awards worthy even.  How this girl keeps escaping Oscar's eye is beyond me.  Newcomer Jay Hernandez is wonderful as well as Carlos and proves he has what it takes to light up the screen, but against Dunst riveting performance he's a little dry.  I was very pleased with Bruce Davison's portrayal of Nicole's father and of course was smitten with Taryn Manning who just explodes with charm and charisma as Nicole's BFF Maddy.  Great film overall, one that desires to be looked at and beautifully lives up to its name.",5,"Far from rehashed territory, gives a nice spin on a tired subject...",1183939200,"07 9, 2007",2007,3575,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'advocate', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'feel', 'brilliantly', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'challenging', 'engaging', 'roles', 'herself', 'just', 'everything', 'impress', 'selected', 'performance', 'said', 'was', 'forced', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'looked', 'long', 'line', 'recycled', 'regurgitated', 'teen', 'love', 'stories', 'out', 'same', 'way', 'never', 'real', 'care', 'concern', 'part', 'audience', 'did', 'however', 'see', 'film', 'theater', 'have', 'say', 'films', 'end', 'was', 'complete', 'shock', 'Crazy/Beautiful', 'genuinely', 'great', 'film', 'script', 'acting', 'films', 'execution', 'subject', 'material', 'may', 'appear', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'light', 'enough', 'pre-chosen', 'path', 'establish', 'originality', 'demand', 'rewatchability.', 'Crazy/Beautiful', 'casts', 'Dunst', 'trouble', 'child', 'Nicole', 'misunderstood', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'congressman', 'who', 'stepmother', 'step', 'way', 'vies', 'attention', 'one', 'screw', 'up', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'serious', 'not', 'school', 'not', 'boys', 'not', 'anything', 'then', 'chance', 'meets', 'Carlos', 'boy', 'who', 'complete', 'opposite', 'Carlos', 'studies', 'hard', 'up', 'extra', 'early', 'travel', 'long', 'distance', 'attend', 'good', 'school', 'can', 'make', 'something', 'everything', 'seriously', 'Nicole', 'relationship', 'explosive', 'according', 'families', 'dangerous', 'Nicole', 'father', 'even', 'Carlos', 'stay', 'far', 'away', 'daughter', 'not', 'concerned', 'well', 'being', 'concerned', 'Carlos', 'fearing', 'Nicole', 'ruin', 'small', 'changes', 'Crazy/Beautiful', 'apart', 'other', 'fluff.As', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'relationship', 'two', 'bend', 'break', 'only', 'reform', 'stronger', 'before', 'actually', 'realistic', 'look', 'teenage', 'relationships', 'today', 'course', 'dramatized', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'take', 'second', 'analyze', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching', ""'ll"", 'see', 'rings', 'forth', 'very', 'true', 'Nicole', 'far', 'bad', 'child', 'just', 'misunderstood', 'one', 'who', 'love', 'attention', 'not', 'receiving', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'handing', 'unconditionally', 'What', 'love', 'most', 'film', 'instead', 'really', 'painting', 'Nicole', 'father', 'stepmother', 'downright', 'are', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'confused', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'handle', 'someone', 'feel', 'bucking', 'constantly', 'As', 'much', 'audience', 'persuaded', 'hate', 'stepmother', 'feel', 'end', 'given', 'credibility', 'film', 'faults', 'parties', 'involved.What', 'really', 'film', 'home', 'powerful', 'performance', 'given', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'amazing', 'here', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'investing', 'so', 'much', 'heart', 'Nicole', 'life', 'Dunst', 'effective', 'scenes', 'drunken', 'breakdown', 'feet', 'father', 'are', 'especially', 'effective', 'awards', 'worthy', 'even', 'How', 'girl', 'escaping', 'Oscar', 'eye', 'Newcomer', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'Carlos', 'what', 'light', 'up', 'screen', 'Dunst', 'riveting', 'performance', 'little', 'dry', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'Bruce', 'Davison', 'portrayal', 'Nicole', 'father', 'course', 'was', 'smitten', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'who', 'just', 'charm', 'charisma', 'Nicole', 'BFF', 'Maddy', 'Great', 'film', 'overall', 'one', 'be', 'looked', 'beautifully', 'up', 'name']",Crazy/ Beautiful

That's why I felt Crazy/Beautiful was an exceptional picture with a completely different set of expectations. While Crazy/Beautiful held strongly to the end, there was one lame scene that shouldn't, somehow, be in the picture because it was hard to sit through that. The rest of the picture was just much better. Crazy/Beautiful worked for its interesting premise, and then the acting made the story a lot better. Another mention of fine performance is Bruce Davidson, the father of the girl. Crazy/Beautiful is not exactly like Romeo and Juliet, but there is some inkling of similarities.

The story, while it's been done before, has never quite been done this well.  Nicole (Dunst in one of her BEST performances to date) is a rich girl with a wild side who continues to stress her father and push her stepmother further away.  Carlos (Hernandes in his breakout role) on the other hand is a poor boy trying hard to make the best of himself, traveling further than need be, waking up earlier than need be, all to get a better education and get a chance to be something bigger than he is.  When they meet it's lust at first sight, but as they grow together they realize how much they need each other.  This is a touching family film that shows well how a childs feeling of neglect and unwantedness can damage there relationships and even result in their inability for better relationships in the future.  Kirsten Dunst is truly a star and she shines so much in this film delivering what has to be her most stunning and commanding performance to date.

Nicole ( Kristen Dunst ) only wants to be loved, and for someone to accept her for who she is, I can relate to that. Eventually everyone wants to be loved. This movie is emotional at times. Sometimes love will take over, especially if the love is that great. Love can distract you from important things in life, but sometimes it doesn't matter. I lost my grandma recently, I can relate to Nicole, it's hard to lose your Mom like that it's very hard. I think love saved Nicole.

543124,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CY5P,"""flickjunkie""","[15, 16]","I hesitated to see this film because having seen my share of Kristen Dunst movies, I wasn't sure I was ready for another teen sugar attack.  However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of ""ahah"" moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film ""Virgin Suicides"", where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.  However, for those who like a good character study with emotionally charged content and complex characters it is well worth a look.",4,Kirsten Dunst shines in an engaging character study,1010275200,"01 6, 2002",2002,4701,"['hesitated', 'see', 'film', 'having', 'seen', 'share', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'movies', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'ready', 'teen', 'sugar', 'attack', 'However', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pleasant', 'departure', 'perky', 'candy', 'coated', 'parts', 'Dunst', 'played', 'past', 'fact', 'might', 'be', 'watershed', 'role', 'marking', 'transition', 'teen', 'roles', 'adult', 'roles.Dunst', 'plays', 'Nicole', 'Oakley', 'troubled', 'teenager', 'privileged', 'family', 'who', 'love', 'Carlos', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'boy', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'presentation', 'remarkably', 'good', 'far', 'greater', 'maturity', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'high', 'school', 'flick.This', 'film', 'exceptional', 'considering', 'limited', 'budget', 'fact', 'most', 'major', 'players', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'experience', 'level', 'writers', 'Phil', 'Hay', 'Matt', 'Manfredi', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'screenplay', 'director', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'only', 'second', 'feature', 'film', 'Likewise', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'Many', 'Latino', 'actors', 'were', 'cast', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'first', 'film', 'comparison', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'jaded', 'veteran', 'use', 'so', 'many', 'ordinary', 'not', 'professional', 'actors', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'film', 'very', 'genuine', 'look', 'feel.Stockwell', 'turns', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'effort', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'first', 'blush', 'out', 'standard', 'boy-meets-girl', 'love', 'story', 'flirt', 'act', 'silly', 'have', 'sex', 'fall', 'love', 'create', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'images', 'beach', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'going', 'be', 'real', 'yawner', 'things', 'begin', 'get', 'complicated', 'Stockwell', 'slowly', 'away', 'layers', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'families', 'reveal', 'subterranean', 'shearing', 'forces', 'will', 'act', 'tear', 'apart.Nicole', 'who', 'first', 'be', 'just', 'wild', 'rebellious', 'brat', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'deeper', 'more', 'emotionally', 'unsettled', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'imagine', 'Carlos', 'humble', 'roots', 'burning', 'ambition', 'bring', 'relationship', 'breaking', 'point', 'when', 'decide', 'Nicole', 'shot', 'Annapolis', 'Stockwell', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'trite', 'teen', 'romance', 'engaging', 'character', 'study', 'pace', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'deliberate', 'inclusive', 'sensitive', 'treatment', 'motivation', 'characters', 'style', 'unraveling', 'psyches', 'slowly', 'eyes', 'great', 'drama', 'film', 'full', 'ahah', 'moments', 'where', 'find', 're-evaluating', 'characters', 'new', 'piece', 'information', 'revealed.Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'had', 'active', 'career', 'appearing', 'twenty', 'films', 'age', 'twenty', 'age', 'will', 'attain', 'April', '2002', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'helped', 'fact', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'ever', 'played', 'was', 'hint', 'ability', 'extended', 'superficial', 'teen', 'characters', 'normally', 'film', 'Virgin', 'Suicides', 'where', 'played', 'sullen', 'bad', 'girl', 'serious', 'problems', 'Nicole', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'range', 'really', 'cuts', 'loose', 'character', 'taking', 'exhilarating', 'uninhibited', 'highs', 'as', 'well', 'crashing', 'depression', 'ridden', 'lows', 'minor', 'film', 'box', 'office', 'perspective', 'performance', 'should', 'get', 'attention', 'casting', 'directors', 'open', 'door', 'get', 'bigger', 'more', 'serious', 'parts', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'promise', 'little', 'wooden', 'film', 'great', 'strength', 'other', 'obvious', 'good', 'looks', 'sincerity', 'word', 'says.I', 'was', 'going', 'crazy', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'had', 'seen', 'Bruce', 'Davidson', 'who', 'played', 'Tom', 'Oakley', 'before', 'played', 'Willard', 'film', 'same', 'name', '1971', 'sociopathic', 'kid', 'who', 'befriended', 'rats', 'used', 'attack', 'enemies', 'Davidson', 'good', 'performance', 'here', 'Nicole', 'congressman', 'father', 'particularly', 'touching', 'scene', 'end.Herman', 'Osario', 'Miguel', 'Castro', 'Tommy', 'De', 'La', 'Cruz', 'were', 'cast', 'first', 'film', 'open', 'auditions', 'thousands', 'Latino', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'provide', 'film', 'lighter', 'moments', 'Carlos', 'friends', 'give', 'fantastic', 'performances', 'basically', 'being', 'Taryn', 'Manning', 'out', 'cast', 'Nicole', 'best', 'friend', 'fine', 'job', 'playing', 'wild', 'thing.I', 'liked', 'film', 'more', 'drama', 'romance', 'rated', '8/10', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'quantum', 'leap', 'performance', 'not', 'impatient', 'viewers', 'who', 'despise', 'slushy', 'romances', 'However', 'who', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'content', 'complex', 'characters', 'well', 'look']",Crazy/ Beautiful

Both of the actors did a wonderful job portraying the characters.  This movie is about the interracial romance between a poor Hispanic kid and a white rich girl. Its also a tale of two opposite people being that Carlos is a hard-working student who travels far to the rich kid's school and Nicole is a rich slacker with little ambition in life.  She has many emotional problems due to her family and the death of her mother.This is not a film that makes their romance easy.  There are problems on both sides being that they come from different worlds and have different ideas on life.  Nicole is a complicated character who makes you angry sometimes but you also see the pain she hides.  She falls for the grounded Carlos who in the end helps her to become a much better person.This film far surpasses the others out there.

It looked like some cheaply made after-school special and so I just thought I'd watch some of it just out of curiousity.  But I have to admit that the more I watched, the more I fell under the film's spell.  On the whole, it is not a bad movie but I think the message it sends is shallow.I can understand why teens in particular would like films like this, particularly those ""free spirit"" or ""rebel"" types.  Basically, the message is that love conquers all.  In this film we see two teens who have absolutely nothing in common fall in love with one another.  The girl is a rich white brat who does nothing but party and get drunk.  The boy is a poor hispanic kid who works hard to do well in school and has dreams of getting into Anapolis to become a Navy pilot.  They first meet each other on the beach and from that time on they start hanging out with one another.  Very early in the relationship, we see signs that the girl is no good for him.  The girl is a wild party animal and he is a clean-cut, upright and studious guy.  Against his mother and brother's wishes he continues to hang out with the troubled girl.  Even the girl's father recommends that he stay away from his daughter due to the fact that she will do nothing but take everything away that he worked so hard for.After a point in the film, the girl becomes somewhat disillusioned to the fact that she is just wasting her life away and questions whether or not she is really good enough for him.  But this is only temporary.The problems I have with this film are the following:1) It doesn't emphasize some of the dangers associated with teen drug use.2) The girl's behavior didn't get her in to enough trouble.  It was almost depicted as ok behavior for teens.3) The film does not illustrate some of the dangers of involving yourself with people who really don't have anything in common with you and more often than not are up to no good.4) One of the messages the films seems to send is that it's alright to follow your animalistic desires and everything will fall into place ok.",3,"a good feel good movie for teens, but rather shallow",1103932800,"12 25, 2004",2004,2147,"['was', 'just', 'flipping', 'channels', 'other', 'night', 'caught', 'beginning', 'film', 'looked', 'cheaply', 'made', 'after-school', 'special', 'so', 'just', 'thought', ""'d"", 'watch', 'just', 'curiousity', 'have', 'admit', 'more', 'watched', 'more', 'fell', 'film', 'spell', 'whole', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'think', 'message', 'shallow.I', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'teens', 'particular', 'would', 'like', 'films', 'particularly', 'free', 'spirit', 'rebel', 'types', 'Basically', 'message', 'love', 'conquers', 'film', 'see', 'two', 'teens', 'who', 'have', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'common', 'fall', 'love', 'one', 'girl', 'rich', 'white', 'brat', 'who', 'nothing', 'party', 'get', 'drunk', 'boy', 'poor', 'hispanic', 'kid', 'who', 'hard', 'do', 'well', 'school', 'dreams', 'getting', 'Anapolis', 'become', 'Navy', 'pilot', 'first', 'meet', 'other', 'beach', 'time', 'start', 'hanging', 'out', 'one', 'Very', 'early', 'relationship', 'see', 'signs', 'girl', 'good', 'girl', 'wild', 'party', 'animal', 'clean-cut', 'upright', 'studious', 'guy', 'mother', 'brother', 'wishes', 'hang', 'out', 'troubled', 'girl', 'Even', 'girl', 'father', 'stay', 'away', 'daughter', 'due', 'fact', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'take', 'everything', 'away', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'for.After', 'point', 'film', 'girl', 'somewhat', 'disillusioned', 'fact', 'just', 'wasting', 'life', 'away', 'questions', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'enough', 'only', 'temporary.The', 'problems', 'have', 'film', 'are', 'following:1', ""n't"", 'emphasize', 'dangers', 'associated', 'teen', 'drug', 'use.2', 'girl', 'behavior', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'trouble', 'was', 'almost', 'depicted', 'ok', 'behavior', 'teens.3', 'film', 'not', 'illustrate', 'dangers', 'involving', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'common', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'are', 'up', 'good.4', 'One', 'messages', 'films', 'send', 'alright', 'follow', 'animalistic', 'desires', 'everything', 'will', 'fall', 'place', 'ok']",Crazy/ Beautiful

The movie deals with some of the more common clich&eacute;s that abound in teen movies.  The difference is that Crazy/Beautiful handles these clich&eacute;s a little bit better than most.  This one takes the basic clich&eacute; of: a boy and a girl with very different backgrounds fall for each other.  Director John Stockwell does a very good job with this basic story.The movie opens with Carlos (Hernandez) waking up before 5 am so he can eat breakfast and run out to catch the bus for a two hour ride to school.  This is a long trip just to go to school and it shows the dedication that Carlos has to his education.  He is there because he wants the education and opportunity that the better school can provide him, even if the cost is a two hour bus ride at 5:30 in the morning.  The movie shifts to Nicole (Dunst) waking up.  It is bright out and we see the contrast between her life and that of Carlos.  They have very different home environments.  It is obvious that while Carlos's neighborhood is not very good, his mother tries to do the best she can.  Nicole lives in a very nice house, but has a much worse home life.  A friend picks her up and Nicole gets to school the same time as Carlos.We see very quickly that Nicole is a problem kid.  She skips classes, spends a lot of time drinking and talks about drugs.  Carlos is a good student and excels on the football field.  Carlos meets Nicole when she is doing community service as probation for a DUI.  They meet again at school and there is an obvious attraction.  They begin spending more and more time with each other.  Carlos's focus to his education and his priorities begin slipping as Nicole seems to be dragging him down.  However, Carlos and Nicole genuinely care for each other.This is a story that has been told many times in many different ways, more often than not with a teen movie (it seems to work very well with youth).  The story is about tolerance, acceptance, and how love can be the impetuous for someone to change.  Surprisingly, this movie was a lot better than I expected and I was impressed by how the film did not preach nor talk down to the audience.  It was not as simplistic as it could have been, and for a teen film, this is a very good one.  As a movie, it is nothing special, but a whole lot better than it should have been.

It is Carlos' mother who is unhappy about the relationship and would prefer that he went out with a nice Hispanic girl.

Deftly directed and well acted, it will appeal to adults, as well as to teens.Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst) is seemingly a lucky teenager, blessed with good looks and wealth, she lacks for nothing. Or does she? Carlos Nunez (Jay Hernandez), the son of a poor, Mexican single mother, is an intelligent teenager, also blessed with good looks. He is also his family's hope for the future.Nicole carries a lot of baggage with her, due to some serious family issues she has yet to work out. She and Jay meet. He manages to see beneath her hard, wild, devil may care veneer. She realizes that Jay treats her as a person and not a boy toy. He manages to look below her hard exterior and sees her vulnerability, as well as her innate kindness, and is touched by it. They manage to fall in love but not without experiencing a few bumps on the road.Having some serious self-esteem problems, however, Nicole is on a downward spiral towards complete self destruction, almost taking Jay with her. He basically pulls her out of the tailspin just before these star crossed lovers both crash land.

Either way Kirsten Dunst was the only good thing about this movie.Even though she was severely skinny in this movie, and she was greasy haired, and not wearing a scrap of makeup most of the time, she played it well, though, for me, her skinniness is severely distracting. Give the girl a good feeding, she's skin & bone.This film could have done well or even better with a higher rating. Instead of a scene where Kirsten leaves the bedroom naked to get some contraception, we get her leaving in a cut off t-shirt and underwear (something tells me Kirsten had something to do with that more than anything). I definitely think the PG13 rating made this film fall flat on its face.There have also certainly been some other scenes left on the cutting room floor, as there's a subplot with some other Latino girls verbally attacking Kirsten's character Nicole, with no reason, although it seems the whole ""white girls taking our men"" comes to light here.Nicole's love of photography in this plays a big part, and over the end credits, it shows some of the photos she's taken during her relationship with the guy (who's name I forget), and there's some really cute pics of the two of them together. Even if sometimes their faces are chopped in half, it's still those photos that make you go ""aaaaaahhhhh"".Overall it's an OK film, if not slightly boring in parts, and as I've already said, an R rating would have been better than the lame PG13 it ended up getting.",3,Kirsten Dunst shines; rest falls flat,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",2005,1727,"['was', 'just', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'movie', 'was', 'fact', 'was', 'rated', 'PG13', 'scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'was', 'originally', 'R', 'fact', 'was', 'highly', 'cliched', 'pretty', 'rich', 'messed', 'up', 'white', 'girl', 'falling', 'love', 'poor', 'Latino', 'boy', 'way', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie.Even', 'was', 'severely', 'skinny', 'movie', 'was', 'greasy', 'haired', 'not', 'wearing', 'scrap', 'makeup', 'most', 'time', 'played', 'well', 'though', 'skinniness', 'severely', 'distracting', 'Give', 'girl', 'good', 'feeding', 'skin', 'bone.This', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'well', 'even', 'better', 'higher', 'rating', 'Instead', 'scene', 'where', 'Kirsten', 'bedroom', 'naked', 'get', 'contraception', 'get', 'leaving', 'cut', 't-shirt', 'underwear', 'something', 'tells', 'Kirsten', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'more', 'anything', 'definitely', 'think', 'PG13', 'rating', 'made', 'film', 'fall', 'flat', 'face.There', 'have', 'also', 'certainly', 'been', 'other', 'scenes', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'subplot', 'other', 'Latino', 'girls', 'verbally', 'attacking', 'Kirsten', 'character', 'Nicole', 'reason', 'whole', 'white', 'girls', 'taking', 'men', 'light', 'here.Nicole', 'love', 'photography', 'big', 'part', 'end', 'credits', 'photos', 'taken', 'relationship', 'guy', 'who', 'name', 'forget', 'really', 'cute', 'pics', 'two', 'together', 'Even', 'sometimes', 'are', 'chopped', 'half', 'still', 'photos', 'make', 'go', 'aaaaaahhhhh', '.Overall', 'OK', 'film', 'not', 'slightly', 'boring', 'parts', ""'ve"", 'already', 'said', 'R', 'rating', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'lame', 'PG13', 'ended', 'up', 'getting']",Crazy/ Beautiful

Fowler ""ben1283""","[0, 0]","Good romantic comedy teen flicks are often few and far between, but it's a pretty safe bet that anything involving the startlingly talented Kirsten Dunst is worth a look.  Crazy/Beautiful deals with rich city girl Nicole, who's off the rails (the 'crazy' Dunst) and her deepening relationship with the serious poor Hispanic kid, Carlos (the 'beautiful' Hernandez) who has aspirations of becoming a pilot.  As the movie progresses, happiness and smiles gives way to doubts and fears - will Nicole drag Carlos down with her?  Can Carlos resolve the tensions in his family with him dating a white girl?Filmed in a gritty, grainy style it's clear from the start that although this might be no revelation Crazy/Beautiful at least sets itself out as a little different.  Dunst gives a typically fantastic turn as the troubled Nicole, managing to emote without ever seeming whiny or tiresome, a girl who sees her faults and hates herself for them and consequently falls headlong into them.  Such a complex (at least for a teen movie) role isn't easy to pull off and it's due to Dunst that we do actually care about the possibly noxious Nicole.  Unfortunately Hernandez's role is a lot more stereotypical, and the race issue was much better evoked in Save The Last Dance, but he's still an appealing performer who creates a realistic relationship with Nicole.Although the trials and tribulations of the relationship will definitely give you a sense of deja-vu, Crazy/Beautiful is a gently moving film that not only promises great things for Dunst but also never feels compelled to fall into cheap violence to get a reaction.  The relationship is drawn out quietly and therefore emotes a great deal more than the histrionics that many directors of similar movies seem to opt for.  In addition there is a realistic portrayal of a troubled teenager in Nicole, and when we learn the root of her trauma it's a genuinely compelling moment.  With a beginning that's scattered with photographs and scrawlings this is an intimate film throughout and works all the better for it.

It's a moving, heartfelt story that I found refreshing.At first the movie appears to be voyeuristic exhibition of adolescent rebellion and excess but it soon becomes apparent that it is something much more as it develops it a serious drama that compelling relates why the heroine is the way that she is and does so in a way that is quite compelling. The script's actually quite skillfully written. The film deals the serious and dark themes of reality but is ultimately very uplifting. Uplifting without being naive, in my opinion.Carlos who the heroine falls in love with is a very likable, responsible genuinely good person and one can't help but admire and empathize with him. The heroine, to some may seem off-putting initially because of her flamboyance and wild ways but is also a character one is drawn to relate to and empathize with. And this is a strength of this movie. You really care about the characters and what they are going through.The movie has a strong and emotionally moving climax.The film feels grounded in reality. Carlos come from a poor, working class mexican-american neighborhood. The heroine comes from rich and privileged family. Her father has remarried and his wife has the attitudes and anxieties that can arise from a flawed individual in high society. And all these situations and backgrounds are well portrayed. The movie is also perfectly paced. It doesn't drag out and get boring nor does it move too fast.I'm not one who usually watches these kinds of movies. I tend to watch hard action movies, art films, thriller/horror films and most of these are foreign films because frankly, most hollywood movies suck.So this review isn't coming from a tearful sentimentalist who keeps a tissue box close at hand as they watch romance after romance. I do have a sensitive side but anyways, all that to say that this review isn't coming from someone who is easily moved by anything and everything.I highly recommend this movie.

The girl-meets-boy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks clich&eacute; is cannily inverted here, with poor little rich girl (Kirsten Dunst) threatening to ruin the life of her hardworking and motivated Latino beau (Jay Hernandez). Will she drag him down with her, or will her life be redeemed through his love? Once it poses that question, the story takes off and the subsequent plot shifts keep you guessing. There's a really great film to be made out of this kind of material, but `Crazy/Beautiful' isn't quite it. It's still good, but what lets it down is its style. A slightly more gritty, documentary-like approach might have made it feel more real. In `Good Will Hunting' and `Nil By Mouth', Gus Van Sant and Gary Oldman both showed that it's possible to make gritty films about realistic characters which still have something delicate, subtle and emotional at their core.",3,Surprisingly good,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,1139,"['irritating', 'string', 'sing-along', 'music', 'videos', 'much', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'film', 'just', 'enough', 'second', 'half', 'pass', 'muster', 'member', 'rarest', 'Hollywood', 'species', 'well-intentioned', 'teen', 'film', 'something', 'interesting', 'say', 'girl-meets-boy-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cannily', 'inverted', 'here', 'poor', 'little', 'rich', 'girl', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'threatening', 'ruin', 'life', 'hardworking', 'motivated', 'Latino', 'beau', 'Jay', 'Hernandez', 'Will', 'drag', 'down', 'will', 'life', 'be', 'redeemed', 'love', 'question', 'story', 'subsequent', 'plot', 'shifts', 'keep', 'guessing', 'really', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'made', 'kind', 'material', 'Crazy/Beautiful', ""n't"", 'quite', 'still', 'good', 'what', 'down', 'style', 'slightly', 'more', 'gritty', 'documentary-like', 'approach', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'feel', 'more', 'real', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Nil', 'Mouth', 'Gus', 'Van', 'Sant', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'showed', 'possible', 'make', 'gritty', 'films', 'realistic', 'characters', 'still', 'have', 'something', 'delicate', 'subtle', 'emotional', 'core']",Crazy/ Beautiful
543155,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00003CY5P,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[0, 0]","This movie has two things going for it. Kristen Dunst is excellent as always (even though her character is pretty much a Manic Pixie Dream Girl who has yet to find the Prozac) and at a certain point the strict father figure actually warns the hero away from his crazy daughter. It's a variation on the formula of the two lovers from opposite sides of the tracks that distinguishes it from every other movie of this kind where the father is just a jerk. There are some actual serious discussions about mental illness which is nice to see (certain Garden State would have been slightly more palatable if the overall theme wasn't ""go off your meds because your quirky crazy ways are awesome."")The rest of this movie follows the formula of scene-montage-scene-montage. I think that this movie sets the record for montages to say that the characters are in love. Also, every Mexican character who is not the main guy (Generic Romantic Lead) is on the verge of saying ""Badges? We don't need no stinking badges."" It's all ""Hey, Pape. I'm totally macho!"" and ""Ooh, check out the senorita and her baby."" I'm convinced that the screenwriter did all of his research on Mexicans by watching Scarface and calling it a day.Still, Kristen Dunst as the depressive and messed up character at the center of the movie has a real talent for getting to the heart of a character who is messed up but has just enough insight into herself to be believable in those confessional moments.There are many parts of this movie that are stupid and eye-rolling. Quite a few parts are quite racist. Overall, it's still worth a watch.",3,Incredibly stupid movie - also a little racist - but has good points,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1600,"['movie', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'excellent', 'always', 'even', 'character', 'pretty', 'much', 'Manic', 'Pixie', 'Dream', 'Girl', 'who', 'yet', 'find', 'Prozac', 'certain', 'point', 'strict', 'father', 'figure', 'actually', 'hero', 'away', 'crazy', 'daughter', 'variation', 'formula', 'two', 'lovers', 'opposite', 'sides', 'tracks', 'other', 'movie', 'kind', 'where', 'father', 'just', 'jerk', 'are', 'actual', 'serious', 'discussions', 'mental', 'illness', 'nice', 'see', 'certain', 'Garden', 'State', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slightly', 'more', 'palatable', 'overall', 'theme', 'was', ""n't"", 'go', 'off', 'meds', 'quirky', 'crazy', 'ways', 'are', 'awesome', 'rest', 'movie', 'formula', 'scene-montage-scene-montage', 'think', 'movie', 'record', 'montages', 'say', 'characters', 'are', 'love', 'Also', 'Mexican', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'main', 'guy', 'Generic', 'Romantic', 'Lead', 'verge', 'saying', 'Badges', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'stinking', 'badges', 'Hey', 'Pape', ""'m"", 'totally', 'macho', 'Ooh', 'check', 'out', 'senorita', 'baby', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'screenwriter', 'did', 'research', 'Mexicans', 'watching', 'Scarface', 'calling', 'day.Still', 'Kristen', 'Dunst', 'depressive', 'messed', 'up', 'character', 'center', 'movie', 'real', 'talent', 'getting', 'heart', 'character', 'who', 'messed', 'up', 'just', 'enough', 'insight', 'be', 'believable', 'confessional', 'are', 'many', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'stupid', 'eye-rolling', 'few', 'parts', 'are', 'quite', 'racist', 'Overall', 'still', 'worth', 'watch']",Crazy/ Beautiful
