1351693,A2V5AGMDQ7A5XM,B003L77GDI,adamKS,"[4, 7]","the most recent season of the office was very similiar to season 6. it was extremely hit or miss and overall it feels underwhelming compared to the seasons that got this show off it's feet and running into everyone's heart(seasons 1-5). i will say though that season 7 did have a lot of great moments and episodes though, it's just too bad that there were a lot of really bad ones too(i was cringing and holding my stomach during the ""michael scarn"" movie episode, just terrible, tacky and it felt like i was watching a completely different show). honestly, what are the writers doing with the characters on the show? it's confusing when you see characters acting out of character and seeing them act in a manner that was against their quirks and validity in past seasons. i don't understand it. i know characters develop and change as series go forward but it's just too drastic. the evolution is not natural and i know a lot of office diehards like myself notice this as well.the show use to use subtle, mysterious crude humor in a way that was endearing, odd and warm. where the show use to fill gaps with awkward pauses and glances is now replaced with egocentricity and pure bluntness. it was also very unnatural how daryl got promoted and the way his character is being used by the writers. .he got promoted solely due to his rising popularity a few years ago and that should be obvious to everyone. daryl use to have a stone cold expression and attitude and he would not be messed with or fooled by no one. .now he plays childish office pranks and is a softy who has emotions about every little thing or situation he's involved in?? it doesn't add up and neither does his role in the office? what is daryl again? what does he do upstairs in the office now? daryl needs to be back down in the warehouse or a job that is not in the office, he was my favorite B character on the show when he was the wharehouse foreman and his interactions with michael were absolutely hilarious but now he is not even remotely funny and he doesn't stand his ground anymore.i think the series as a whole would have been perfect if they would ended it with the season 5 finale. that episode showed the open yet hopeful reconnection between michael and holly at the company picnic and i think it would have been GREAT if they would have left that open-ended like the way season 5 ended. you can tell there was hope, content, and a little desperation in michael's eyes at the end of the season when he was talking to the camera but everyone knew deep down they would end up together. instead, they ring it out for 2 more seasons and it started getting really old in season 7 and it just ended up being not as memorable as it would have been if they left it unanswered and unaired.as for jim and pam, another fine example of why the show should have ended after 5 seasons. we saw them get together in season 4 and throughout seasons 4 and 5 we saw some classic, tender-hearted, hilarious moments between the famous couple but ultimately they were happy and it was still endearing up till the season 5 finale. the tension between them while pam was away at art school and then when she left to go to the michael scott paper company was the last good/interesting interactions we saw between pam and jim. seasons 6 and 7 was too cute and too adorable too much of the time and it was just boring and redundant. when season 5 ended with them finding out they were having a baby was just PERFECT. . .the reaction and the emotion was unmatched by anything post season 5 between the two. also, we saw a blooming crush and possible relationship between andy and erin at the end of season 5 which resolved the andy's faulty engagement to angela. we saw dwight stick up for angela and we sensed a resolution between the two in the future. that's about it, everything was set to be wrapped up and conflicts to be resolved with some great open ended and what if's. why couldn't the writers just leave the show on a highmark and end it at the season 5 finale?? i guess they needed to draw out more unnessecary episodes so they can put their kids through college and be able to retire by the time their 50. greedy move on the part of the writers/producers. the series could have been perfect but instead we have 5 classic seasons. . .and 3+ OK, unnessecary seasons.obviously, the show is going on without michael and at this point i just don't know what to say. michael scott IS the office and going on without him just seems arrogant by the writers and disrespectful to michael gary scott's character and compassion he gave us the past 7 years. what are the writers trying to prove now? just end it already. however, we did see a promising cameo by james spader at the end of the season 7 and that showed promise. the uncomfortableness and awkward glances that he gave in the 2 scenes he was in is what the show had been missing the past 2 seasons. he was extremely hilarious and creepy and this would be a HUGE improvement to replace kathy bates awful and tacky character ""Jo"" with spader's roger california. season 8 might have some potentional with spader at the helm but still doesn't make up for the fact that michael is gone and their continuing without him?all in all, the season is alot like season 6 whereas it is hit or miss and it continues on with the same type of humor and characters that seem out of sync. however, the season is worth having alone i think just due to michael scott's last season and him leaving the show. michael knew the series was over but why didn't the writers/crew know this??here's to hoping for a redeeming, better albeit michael-less season 8.",3,we waive goodbye to michael gary scott. . .but not the series?,1315267200,"09 6, 2011",2011,5652,"['most', 'recent', 'season', 'office', 'was', 'very', 'similiar', 'season', '6.', 'was', 'extremely', 'hit', 'miss', 'overall', 'underwhelming',

1351701,A2EMCAIBSGNH0S,B003L77GDI,BurningKerosene,"[14, 25]","I'll start by saying The Office is probably my all-time favorite comedy. My problem with this season (and the end of last) is that the realistic nature of the show is gone. All the characters are completely over the top and unbelievable, and it just doesn't suck me in. I think if you just started watching it in the past year or so, you might not notice this and like the new episodes, but it's not the same show I became a huge fan of. The whole premise of the show is a documentary of a real office, with believable things happening (to a degree...i mean, it is a TV show after all). In the episode where Dwight is acting manager, he accidentally shoots a gun into the ground, but isn't fired or even reprimanded. Seriously? Compare that with earlier seasons when Michael quoted a racially inappropriate skit from Chris Rock, and he got in trouble for that...but Dwight doesn't get in trouble for firing a loaded weapon. Like I said - the show started of as something very believable, and now it's just a TV show going for a cheap laugh. I knew I was going to be unhappy from the opening of the season with the whole dancing/YouTube thing they did. Most of the episodes I shut off half way through because I was so uninterested in what was going on.I think this show made a big mistake putting Pam and Jim together so early AND making their relationship go so perfectly once they did. How boring is it that they get along so great? It sums up the show's path in general, and what another reviewer said - the show used to be a drama with comedy naturally coming from the characters interactions. I used to tune in every week to find out what was going to happen...and also laugh my butt off in the process. Now it's just a bunch of jokes without purpose and significant context.That said - the writers got their act together for Michael's final episode. It was hands down the best episode in the past 2 years, and was just well done all around. The writers made me feel like I was personally saying goodbye to Michael. Not to mention Michael and Jim's goodbye was one of the best scenes the show has ever done. Then Michael mouthing ""that's what she said"" after taking off his microphone pack...absolutely brilliant. To me, that episode was the end of the series. Here's to hoping they bring back Michael for the actual finale and send the show off right.",2,This show is way past it's prime,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,2357,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying', 'Office', 'probably', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'problem', 'season', 'end', 'last', 'realistic', 'nature', 'show', 'gone', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'top', 'unbelievable', 'just', ""n't"", 'suck', 'think', 'just', 'started', 'watching', 'past', 'year', 'so', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'new', 'episodes', 'not', 'same', 'show', 'became', 'huge', 'fan', 'whole', 'premise', 'show', 'documentary', 'real', 'office', 'believable', 'things', 'happening', 'degree', 'i', 'mean', 'TV', 'show', 'episode', 'where', 'Dwight', 'acting', 'manager', 'accidentally', 'gun', 'ground', ""n't"", 'fired', 'even', 'reprimanded', 'Seriously', 'Compare', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'when', 'Michael', 'quoted', 'racially', 'inappropriate', 'skit', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'got', 'trouble', 'Dwight', ""n't"", 'get', 'trouble', 'firing', 'loaded', 'weapon', 'said', 'show', 'started', 'something', 'very', 'believable', 'now', 'just', 'TV', 'show', 'going', 'cheap', 'laugh', 'knew', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'unhappy', 'opening', 'season', 'whole', 'dancing/YouTube', 'thing', 'did', 'Most', 'episodes', 'shut', 'off', 'half', 'way', 'was', 'so', 'uninterested', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.I', 'think', 'show', 'made', 'big', 'mistake', 'putting', 'Pam', 'Jim', 'together', 'so', 'early', 'making', 'relationship', 'go', 'so', 'perfectly', 'did', 'How', 'boring', 'get', 'along', 'so', 'great', 'sums', 'up', 'show', 'path', 'general', 'what', 'reviewer', 'said', 'show', 'used', 'be', 'drama', 'comedy', 'naturally', 'coming', 'characters', 'interactions', 'used', 'tune', 'week', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'also', 'laugh', 'butt', 'process', 'Now', 'just', 'bunch', 'jokes', 'purpose', 'significant', 'context.That', 'said', 'writers', 'got', 'act', 'together', 'Michael', 'final', 'episode', 'was', 'hands', 'down', 'best', 'episode', 'past', '2', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'well', 'done', 'around', 'writers', 'made', 'feel', 'was', 'personally', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Michael', 'Not', 'mention', 'Michael', 'Jim', 'goodbye', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'show', 'ever', 'done', 'Then', 'Michael', 'mouthing', 'what', 'said', 'taking', 'off', 'microphone', 'pack', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'was', 'end', 'series', 'Here', 'hoping', 'bring', 'back', 'Michael', 'actual', 'finale', 'send', 'show', 'off', 'right']",N/A

1351704,A3BV64Q6FE665L,B003L77GDI,C. Rexford,"[3, 7]","The DVD disk-set for season 7 is up to par with the clarity and volume of the previous seasons, which is good. There are 24 episodes on 5 disks in this season, and the extras in this set include the re-enactment of Scott's ""Threat Level Midnight"" play, webisodes of ""The Accountants"", deleted scenes, bloopers and commentaries. I believe the extras are longer and better than in the previous two sets.The show in season seven is better than in seasons 5-6, in my opinion. Much has been written here about the contents of the episodes, but suffice it for me to say that I found Scott less annoying and ridiculous than in the last two seasons, and it was nice to see Dwight brought back up to the foreground of a few episodes as well.*SPOILERS*I am NOT a Ferrel-fan and so am relieved he did not stay. Season 7 is basically just more of season 6, with only one goal...to release Scott.  The later episodes in season 7 seem to just drag the ""Is Michael Scott going to leave with Holly?"" bit.  The Departure of Gabe was a disappointment for me as I enjoyed his character. It was great to see Oscar get some limelight.

1351705,A3QU74B9N0830G,B003L77GDI,Dan Thompson,"[0, 0]","Ah, the season we've all been dreading. After seven glorious and hilarious years, Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, is leaving for good. His farewell season isn't as strong as previous seasons, namely two through four, but still offers a lot of laughs and guest appearances. A few of the appearances to note are Kathy Bates as Jo, the head of Sabre and lover of giant dogs, Timothy Olyphant as Danny Cordray, a successful traveling businessman trying to poach clients away from Dunder Mifflin, and Will Ferrell as DeAngelo Vickers, the temporary branch manager that makes Michael look like a business guru.The majority of the season deals with Michael's departure and who is going to take over. There's a lot of hijinks that occur as a result of potential managers that interview for the branch manager position. The final two episodes have A TON of cameos from well-known comedians, and are hilarious to watch. In true Office fashion, the Halloween and Christmas episodes are some of the best of the season, which is appropriate as they'll be Michael's last. A few other standout episodes for me include &#34;Andy's Play&#34;, in which Andy is part of the community theater's rendition of Sweeney Todd, &#34;Threat Level Midnight&#34;, the long overdue and hilarious feature film by Michael, &#34;Goodbye Michael&#34; as the touching and appropriate sendoff for Carell, and the two-parter &#34;Search Committee&#34; in which the office searches for Michael's replacement.This show has always belonged to Carell, who was SO good as the incompetent boss whose awkwardness knew no bounds. I understand the desire to pursue other projects but Steve will truly be missed. I write this review a few season after the fact and can safely say that the show is not the same without him. This is a great final season for him to be featured in.The set itself contains a lot of funny extras, including blooper reals, deleted scenes, and webisodes. The set also contains the essential extended edition of &#34;Threat Level Midnight.&#34;",4,"Farewell, Michael Scott",1360627200,"02 12, 2013",2013,2029,"['Ah', 'season', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dreading', 'seven', 'glorious', 'hilarious', 'years', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'played', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'leaving', 'good', 'farewell', 'season', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'previous', 'seasons', 'namely', 'two', 'four', 'still', 'lot', 'laughs', 'guest', 'appearances', 'few', 'appearances', 'note', 'are', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Jo', 'head', 'Sabre', 'lover', 'giant', 'dogs', 'Timothy', 'Olyphant', 'Danny', 'Cordray', 'successful', 'traveling', 'businessman', 'trying', 'poach', 'clients', 'away', 'Dunder', 'Mifflin', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'DeAngelo', 'Vickers', 'temporary', 'branch', 'manager', 'Michael', 'look', 'business', 'guru.The', 'majority', 'season', 'deals', 'Michael', 'departure', 'who', 'going', 'take', 'over', 'lot', 'hijinks', 'occur', 'result', 'potential', 'managers', 'interview', 'branch', 'manager', 'position', 'final', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'TON', 'cameos', 'well-known', 'comedians', 'are', 'hilarious', 'watch', 'true', 'Office', 'fashion', 'Halloween', 'Christmas', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'season', 'appropriate', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Michael', 'last', 'few', 'other', 'standout', 'episodes', 'include', '34', 'Andy', 'Play', '34', 'Andy', 'part', 'community', 'theater', 'rendition', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', '34', 'Threat', 'Level', 'Midnight', '34', 'long', 'overdue', 'hilarious', 'feature', 'film', 'Michael', '34', 'Goodbye', 'Michael', '34', 'touching', 'appropriate', 'sendoff', 'Carell', 'two-parter', '34', 'Search', 'Committee', '34', 'office', 'searches', 'Michael', 'replacement.This', 'show', 'always', 'belonged', 'Carell', 'who', 'was', 'SO', 'good', 'incompetent', 'boss', 'awkwardness', 'knew', 'bounds', 'understand', 'desire', 'pursue', 'other', 'projects', 'Steve', 'will', 'truly', 'be', 'missed', 'write', 'review', 'few', 'season', 'fact', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'show', 'not', 'same', 'great', 'final', 'season', 'be', 'featured', 'in.The', 'set', 'lot', 'funny', 'extras', 'including', 'blooper', 'reals', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'webisodes', 'set', 'also', 'essential', 'extended', 'edition', '34', 'Threat', 'Level', 'Midnight.', '34']",N/A

After the first few astonishing and surprising minutes of the first episode of this season (where the employees ad lib to a song apparently to put a video on You Tube) I, still with my jaw fropped, thought: ""Man, this season is going to be the best ever!"". That was not the case, but the season itself was good.There's no doubt the writers tried to be innovative (they must be, otherwise audience will fall after so many seasons of a show). But something is awkward here. The office guys are always in a party somewhere. There is no tense and gripping episode (like, for example the ""Did I stutter"" episode where Stanley challenges Michael, or the basketball game between warehouse and office guys... there are so many of them memorable episodes). They try, and it seems they always fail. The Gabe characters is weak, they turned Erin into a completely moron. Yes, she's still eye candy and I understand she is suppose to be a joy, full of life, but, making her... dumb? Didn't get it. Also, it was weird to not have some strong corporate headquartes character, like David Wallace, or Jan, or even Kathy Bates. It seemed the office has no crisis anymore, the sales are stupendous for everyone, there are no opponents.Some plots are simply unresolved and somewhat nasty, like Dwight viciously beating Jim almost do death (exaggerating here, of course:)in Christmas party with snowballs, and Jim doing nothing to reverse the situation. Other unresolved plot is when Jim does not receive any more comissions because he reached his comission cap for the year, a fact he did not know about. Also, Timothy Olyphant character's, a top-sales man, is hired by Michael then simply dissapears from the show. Also, plausibility was thrown to the wind: Pam becomes ""Office Administrator"" using nasty tactics (be it: lying through her teeth to al her fellow job comrades). This is not the Pam we knew.The Holly came back was reasonably well treated.I'm not a great fun of Will Ferrell, but his performance surprised me. It was a clever decision to bring someone famous as a comedian to temporarily fill Carrell's shoes and easy the transition to the permanent new manager (who by now we all know is Andy Bernard).Michael Scott leaving the show is not the biggest problem for me. It was clear this season that, since Michael was leaving, they tried to make him a little less despicable. Although Carrell was clearly the main character, the supporting cast is great. The trouble, for me, is the writing itselt. But I hope next season will be great.",4,This is The Office.

1351739,A30JVMVY6KL3EK,B003L77GDI,Robert D. Watson,"[27, 40]","I'm torn on my opinion of the Office Season 7.On one level, there are the truly excellent episodes, from ""Threat Level Midnight"" to the ""Herpes"" episode which was full of cameos.  The ""PDA"" episode and ""The Search"" really show how good of an actor both Steve Carrell and Amy Ryan are, and manage to be funny and quite heartfelt at the same time.  Holly, one of my favorite characters, comes back, and Jo is absent from almost the entire season, which is a definite plus, though she did have her moments in the two hour finale.  Michael Scott's final episode was wonderful, and there were some hilarious spots in almost every episode.However, I used the word ""almost"" in the last paragraph for a reason.  ""China"", ""Viewing Party"", ""the Inner Circle"" and ""Christening"" were, on the whole, pretty terrible episodes from my point of view.  ""Classy Christmas"" and ""The Seminar"" weren't far behind.  On some of them, I kept waiting for something to make me laugh, and there wasn't any payoff.  The whole middle of this season was basically a train wreck that made me almost want to turn off my television mid-episode.  I'm a harsh critic when it comes to the Office, if only because I know what the show is capable of creating, and the magic definitely left the building mid-season.It got slightly more appealing to watch some of the later episodes, which would, of course, be some of Steve Carrell's last.  He puts on a tour de force of three or four superior episodes leading up to his finale that could only be brought down by the talent, or lack thereof, of Will Farrell.  I've never been the least bit interested in the one character that he seems to play in every appearance, TV or on the big screen, and I can't say that I'm at all happy that he blemished five episodes of one of my favorite TV series here.  Whether he's completely over-the-top or so subdued you hardly even notice him, the writing department clearly doesn't know whether they should use him as Michael Scott 2 or someone completely different, and needless to say, I was very relieved when he was gone.  Those episodes as a whole, though, were excellent, saved by the superior cast of the show and Steve Carrell's genius.But ever since Season 3 started, the Office has been more about the developing storylines of the characters than the comedy, which comes naturally as a result of the interactions between the strong and distinct personalities.  Andy and Gabe get significant screen time, which is a plus, and unfortunately, Erin is drawn into this as well.  I don't know what to think about her.  At times, she's cute and innocent, like a younger Pam, while at others, she's just so stone-cold stupid that I can't stand her.  Two of the best moments of the season put her at the center of events, though, when she calmly announces that Holly can't be Michael's girlfriend because she isn't good-looking enough, and when she breaks up with Gabe on stage at the Dundies, part 2, which was very reminiscent of the classically awkward moments that defined earlier seasons.  Overall, I simply hope they find some consistency with her instead of trying to make her a Pam/Kevin hybrid.The other character who is bothering me this season is Darrell, who used to just be the fun loving guy downstairs and a chance for Michael to make some off-color racial remarks to.  Now that he's upstairs, he's lost his fun element, and he's just another body.  A body who seems to be taking a lot of screen time away from the other, funnier and more interesting characters who have all but disappeared.While it's obvious that much of the focus of the show has to settle around Michael Scott because of his departure, I think it's inexcusable to completely ignore Creed (until the final episode), Meredith, Stanley, Toby, and Phyllis, who combined might have twenty-six lines of dialog in all 26 episodes.  For a large part of the beginning of the season, Jim and Pam are there for some one-liners, and absent otherwise.  Some of the characters seem almost like parodies of their former selves.  This is particularly evident in  Kevin and Angela, the former being a little too inept to be believable, and the latter basically being transformed into a one-joke punchline.  The strange thing about Angela is that her story in Season 7 actually has a lot of promise, but is almost completely ignored (she's unknowingly acting as the beard to the gay state senator, in case you forgot since you rarely see or hear from her).I guess overall the biggest thing that Season 7 is lacking is continuity.  Hopefully this will get a whole lot better now that Steve Carrell is officially gone, and all of the backstage drama and shenanigans of writing him out of the show has come to an end.  Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Scott, and will miss him greatly, but the season as a whole struggled because of him.  Hopefully, the writing team can focus on getting the show back on track, and hopefully, it will be done without the need to keep introducing new members to the Dunder Mifflin/Sabre team we all know and love.  The guest stars were getting on my nerves.By the way, I'm calling it now: Pam will be the new manager come Season 8.",4,Office Season 7,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,5177,"[""'m"", 'torn', 'opinion',

1351741,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B003L77GDI,S. Der,"[1, 9]","Some minor spoilers!This season is all right. Michael and Holly are back together in this season. I really liked this season for that. Michael has been through a lot of hard times with his love life; super hard! That's what she said! His goal for every season was to find a woman that he can settle down with and start a family with. He finally got it. Holly is that woman and they are great for each other. They left the office together and will live happily ever after....so it seems...lol You never know...maybe they'll come back in season 8. Maybe, if there's a season 9...who knows.Will Farrell performance in the show was good. The writers just made his character very bad. I like Will Farrell to be really funny and silly. In The Office, he isn't that at all. He was tone down too much. He looked like he would break out and start making me laugh, but that didn't happen. Instead he was kind of duh and boring to watch. I just kept on watching to see if he would make me laugh at some point, but that didn't happen. He just played a regular old tough boss character. He wasn't like a silly, funny, or sometimes crazy boss like Michael was. So, you shouldn't expect that kind of laughter from Farrell here. The only time he did something crazy caused him to leave the show, which the writers wanted.I like how finally Jim and Pan are married, but they are a boring married couple with a baby now. I think it would had been better if they were just married, but not with a baby yet. The writers could had played up how being married isn't all too great in the beginning. Then, later on, they have a baby and it's all happy times again. But, they didn't do that so it's just a family with family problems story. In the show, they keep on talking about their baby in almost every episode. It doesn't really interest me very much. Blah, Blah, Blah. In one episode, when Farrell was on the show, Pam wanted to show Farrell's character a picture of her baby during a meeting. I liked how Farrell put down his foot and stopped her from disrupting the meeting and showing him the picture. Who really needs to see that? Another example, was in another show, were Pam wanted to show pictures to Andy of a new office building, but he thought she was just showing him pictures of her baby. He didn't look at the pictures and kept on working, while pretending to look at the pictures. ha ha ha That's how I feel when I start seeing a Jim/Pan/baby part in the show. Next story please!What I find interesting now is plot with Aaron, Andy, and Gabe. Gabe is the character that I really hate seeing with Aaron and I want to see her with Andy. That's what's drawing me to watching the show. That's the same set up in the earlier seasons with Pan, Roy, and Jim. A 3-way love triangle with the third person being the person that I want to see in the couple.If history does repeats itself, then in the show, Aaron and Andy will most likely end up being together. They already set it up in season 7 for that to happen. Also, they might even get married. This is probably the only real reason why I will keep on watching the show. For the next season, you might want to know who will be the new manager of the office. That's sort of interesting, but I rather see the Andy and Aaron situation.",3,Season 7 okay,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",2011,3275,"['minor', 'spoilers', 'season', 'right', 'Michael', 'Holly', 'are', 'back', 'together', 'season', 'really', 'liked', 'season', 'Michael', 'been', 'lot', 'hard', 'times', 'love', 'life', 'super', 'hard', 'what', 'said', 'goal', 'season', 'was', 'find', 'woman', 'can', 'settle', 'down', 'start', 'family', 'finally', 'got', 'Holly', 'woman', 'are', 'great', 'other', 'left', 'office', 'together', 'will', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', '.so', 'lol', 'never', 'know', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'come', 'back', 'season', '8', 'Maybe', 'season', '9', 'who', 'knows.Will', 'Farrell', 'performance', 'show', 'was', 'good', 'writers', 'just', 'made', 'character', 'very', 'bad', 'like', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'be', 'really', 'funny', 'silly', 'Office', ""n't"", 'that', 'was', 'tone', 'down', 'too', 'much', 'looked', 'would', 'break', 'out', 'start', 'making', 'laugh', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Instead', 'was', 'kind', 'duh', 'boring', 'watch', 'just', 'kept', 'watching', 'see', 'would', 'make', 'laugh', 'point', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'just', 'played', 'regular', 'old', 'tough', 'boss', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'silly', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'crazy', 'Michael', 'was', 'So', 'should', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'laughter', 'Farrell', 'here', 'only', 'time', 'did', 'something', 'crazy', 'caused', 'leave', 'show', 'writers', 'wanted.I', 'how', 'finally', 'Jim', 'Pan', 'are', 'married', 'are', 'boring', 'married', 'couple', 'baby', 'now', 'think', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'were', 'just', 'married', 'not', 'baby', 'yet', 'writers', 'could', 'had', 'played', 'up', 'how', 'being', 'married', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'great', 'beginning', 'Then', 'later', 'have', 'baby', 'happy', 'times', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'just', 'family', 'family', 'problems', 'story', 'show', 'keep', 'talking', 'baby', 'almost', 'episode', ""n't"", 'really', 'interest', 'very', 'much', 'Blah', 'Blah', 'Blah', 'one', 'episode', 'when', 'Farrell', 'was', 'show', 'Pam', 'wanted', 'show', 'Farrell', 'character', 'picture', 'baby', 'meeting', 'liked', 'how', 'Farrell', 'put', 'down', 'foot', 'stopped', 'disrupting', 'meeting', 'showing', 'picture', 'Who', 'really', 'see', 'example', 'was', 'show', 'were', 'Pam', 'wanted', 'show', 'pictures', 'Andy', 'new', 'office', 'building', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'showing', 'pictures', 'baby', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'pictures', 'kept', 'working', 'pretending', 'look', 'pictures', 'ha', 'ha', 'ha', 'how', 'feel', 'when', 'start', 'seeing', 'Jim/Pan/baby', 'part', 'show', 'Next', 'story', 'please', 'What', 'find', 'interesting', 'now', 'plot', 'Aaron', 'Andy', 'Gabe', 'Gabe', 'character', 'really', 'hate', 'seeing', 'Aaron', 'want', 'see', 'Andy', 'what', 'drawing', 'watching', 'show', 'same', 'set', 'up', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Pan', 'Roy', 'Jim', '3-way', 'love', 'triangle', 'third', 'person', 'being', 'person', 'want', 'see', 'couple.If', 'history', 'repeats', 'then', 'show', 'Aaron', 'Andy', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'together', 'already', 'set', 'up', 'season', '7', 'happen', 'Also', 'might', 'even', 'get', 'married', 'probably', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'will', 'keep', 'watching', 'show', 'next', 'season', 'might', 'want', 'know', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'manager', 'office', 'sort', 'interesting', 'rather', 'see', 'Andy', 'Aaron', 'situation']",N/A

1351744,A3NDUPK7KWAG8Q,B003L77GDI,T. Barnes,"[7, 15]","The first 100-odd episodes of The Office (US) rank among the greatest television of the last 20 years; I'll have fond memories (and the episodes to re-watch) of those five seasons forever. However, the last couple of years have suffered from some sort of decline. Season 7 was a little better than the minor travesty that wasThe Office: Season Six, but I think this is probably where the series should end. It's not necessarily even that the show needs Steve Carell to be funny, as the episode after 'DeAngelo Vickers' (who was probably the low point of the season) left was one of the best this year; I just think they've run out of gas.This isn't exactly surprising; after all, the number of TV shows that can have 7 seasons and 150 episodes without some sort of decline can be counted on one hand. The Office gave us some great, great episodes and was actually pretty entertaining this year-- but it's time to let go. I don't know if I'm going to tune in next year, but for the first time in years I don't think it'll be worth it. It's been a great run, that much is certain.High Points of S7 (spoilers for the rest of the review) :""PDA"": Michael and Holly are dating now. Three seasons' worth of sexual tension have been resolved, for the most part. But according to Dunder-Mifflin rules, they can't publicly display their affection wantonly around the office. They are dismayed. This episode wasn't much in the grand scheme of things, but it was enjoyable and funny in the way that The Office was way back in the good ol' days.""Garage Sale/Goodbye, Michael"": Some parts of these episodes did irk me a little, but overall I liked the sentimental reception Michael received as he prepared to leave. ""Goodbye, Michael"" expertly managed this, as it avoided the huge musical-number type sendoff I was fairly certain he would recieve for a more understated and, ultimately, touching exit for Michael Scott.""Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager"": Sure, there was the wildly outlandish gun injury Dwight gave Andy, but the episode did show me that the series could be funny w/o Michael Scott. It was funny, and that's all I can say.Other fairly good episodes: ""The Sting"", ""China"", ""Classy Christmas"", ""Ultimatum""Bad Points:""The Inner Circle"": DeAngelo Vickers is the absolute worst character/plotline/anything The Office has ever even hinted at bringing into the show. (Slight hyperbole, I'll admit.) He may have had one line that got a half-hearted chuckle out of me, but mostly he was just a black hole of funny. He didn't really bring anything to the show, served only as a ratings draw (and not a very good one, to boot) and was more of a mass of odd character traits than anything resembling a character. His exit in ""Inner Circle"" was especially dreadful, as the writers apparently decided to just put him in a coma after forcing us to sit through his terrible plotlines for four episodes. His time-wasting sideplot in ""Goodbye, Michael"" was also bad. In a word, DeAngelo Vickers was terrible.""Christening""/: The increasing trend of episodes where everyone in the office meet outside of work for a social function is one example of the show's decline; do they really expect us to believe that these people who are mostly apathetic/antagonistic to each other during the 9 hours they are forced to spend near each other want to spend so much time together outside of work? I mean, having everyone in the office show up for J/P's baby's christening is pretty far-fetched--but they also go to Andy's play, and watch Glee together, and all agree to star in Michael's movie? One or two would be ok, but that's quite far-fetched.""Michael's Last Dundies"": A choreographed musical number for a boss that had embarrassed, belittled and generally aggravated them for the last 7+ years? I can accept a lot (Michael's proposal in 'Garage Sale', for one), but that was too much. I mean, he egged Toby's house and demeaned him at the Dundies in that same episode-- but he still sung ""Seasons of Love"" for him? Bit much.Grade: 3/5",3,Probably The End,1313107200,"08 12, 2011",2011,4017,"['first', '100-odd', 'episodes', 'Office', 'US', 'rank', 'greatest', 'television', 'last', '20', 'years', ""'ll"", 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'episodes', 're-watch', 'five', 'seasons', 'forever', 'However', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'have', 'suffered', 'sort', 'decline', 'Season', '7', 'was', 'little', 'better', 'minor', 'travesty', 'wasThe', 'Office', 'Season', 'Six', 'think', 'probably', 'where', 'series', 'should', 'end', 'not', 'necessarily', 'even', 'show', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'be', 'funny', 'episode', ""'DeAngelo"", 'Vickers', 'who', 'was', 'probably', 'low', 'point', 'season', 'left', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'just', 'think', ""'ve"", 'run', 'gas.This', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'surprising', 'number', 'TV', 'shows', 'can', 'have', '7', 'seasons', '150', 'episodes', 'sort', 'decline', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'one', 'hand', 'Office', 'gave', 'great', 'great', 'episodes', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'year', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'going', 'tune', 'next', 'year', 'first', 'time', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'been', 'great', 'run', 'much', 'certain.High', 'Points', 'S7', 'spoilers', 'rest', 'review', 'PDA', 'Michael', 'Holly', 'are', 'dating', 'now', 'Three', 'seasons', 'worth', 'sexual', 'tension', 'have', 'been', 'resolved', 'most', 'part', 'according', 'Dunder-Mifflin', 'rules', 'ca', ""n't"", 'publicly', 'display', 'affection', 'wantonly', 'office', 'are', 'dismayed', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'funny', 'way', 'Office', 'was', 'way', 'back', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'Garage', 'Sale/Goodbye', 'Michael', 'parts', 'episodes', 'did', 'irk', 'little', 'overall', 'liked', 'sentimental', 'reception', 'Michael', 'received', 'prepared', 'leave', 'Goodbye', 'Michael', 'expertly', 'managed', 'avoided', 'huge', 'musical-number', 'type', 'sendoff', 'was', 'fairly', 'certain', 'would', 'recieve', 'more', 'understated', 'ultimately', 'touching', 'exit', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Dwight', 'K.', 'Schrute', 'Acting', 'Manager', 'Sure', 'was', 'wildly', 'outlandish', 'gun', 'injury', 'Dwight', 'gave', 'Andy', 'episode', 'did', 'show', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'funny', 'w/o', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'was', 'funny', 'can', 'say.Other', 'fairly', 'good', 'episodes', 'Sting', 'China', 'Classy', 'Christmas', 'Ultimatum', 'Bad', 'Points', 'Inner', 'Circle', 'DeAngelo', 'Vickers', 'absolute', 'worst', 'character/plotline/anything', 'Office', 'ever', 'even', 'hinted', 'bringing', 'show', 'Slight', 'hyperbole', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'line', 'got', 'half-hearted', 'chuckle', 'mostly', 'was', 'just', 'black', 'hole', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'bring', 'anything', 'show', 'served', 'only', 'ratings', 'draw', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'boot', 'was', 'more', 'mass', 'odd', 'character', 'traits', 'anything', 'resembling', 'character', 'exit', 'Inner', 'Circle', 'was', 'especially', 'dreadful', 'writers', 'apparently', 'decided', 'just', 'put', 'coma', 'forcing', 'sit', 'terrible', 'plotlines', 'four', 'episodes', 'time-wasting', 'sideplot', 'Goodbye', 'Michael', 'was', 'also', 'bad', 'word', 'DeAngelo', 'Vickers', 'was', 'terrible', 'Christening', '/', 'increasing', 'trend', 'episodes', 'where', 'everyone', 'office', 'meet', 'work', 'social', 'function', 'one', 'example', 'show', 'decline', 'do', 'really', 'expect', 'believe', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'apathetic/antagonistic', 'other', '9', 'hours', 'are', 'forced', 'spend', 'other', 'want', 'spend', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'together', 'work', 'mean', 'having', 'everyone', 'office', 'show', 'up', 'J/P', 'baby', 'christening', 'pretty', 'far-fetched', 'also', 'go', 'Andy', 'play', 'watch', 'Glee', 'together', 'agree', 'star', 'Michael', 'movie', 'One', 'two', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'quite', 'far-fetched', 'Michael', 'Last', 'Dundies', 'choreographed', 'musical', 'number', 'boss', 'had', 'embarrassed', 'belittled', 'generally', 'aggravated', 'last', '7+', 'years', 'can', 'accept', 'lot', 'Michael', 'proposal', ""'Garage"", 'Sale', 'one', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'mean', 'egged', 'Toby', 'house', 'demeaned', 'Dundies', 'same', 'episode', 'still', 'Seasons', 'Love', 'Bit', 'much.Grade', '3/5']",N/A

It had the typical humor, though definitely toned down, but it also was genuinely moving. I loved the way that Michael said goodbye to everyone, and the way that he acted in the end. He didn't try to make a big deal out of it, and even decided to have a party for the people that were still in the office. It was nice to see that Michael had changed, but that he still retained much of his ""immature"" shenanigans. He even said goodbye to Toby. His goodbyes to the staples of the show--Dwight, Jim, and Pam--were seriously moving. His recommendation letter and last paintball; and his lunch with Jim that would never come...both amazing. It sucks that Steve Carell chose to leave the show. I imagine the actual goodbyes were as emotional as the show's.I don't know how the next episode and coming seasons will be able to live up to this episode.

1351748,AP3B615GM191G,B003L77GDI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[17, 38]","With the exception of potentially Family Guy, I consider ""The Office"" to be the greatest television comedy ever produced.  Sadly, all good things must come to an end--eventually--and this seventh season emphasizes that quote more than any of the previous six efforts.Here's the problem(s) with Season Seven: I've always believed that the entire series hinges on three characters--Jim, Pam, and Michael Scott.  Jim & Pam form the dramatic/emotional backbone of the show, while Michael is the comedic ""glue"" that holds everything together.  The other characters wax and wane depending on the episode, but that ""Big Three"" more than likely decides the course of the show.  Unfortunately, none of those three character arcs were anywhere near the top of their game this season.In terms of Jim/Pam, they really carried the Sixth Season (with the wedding and baby episodes) and take a bit of a back seat here in favor of Daryl, Andy, Erin, & Gabe.  While providing a few moments of chuckling humor and emotion, by and large the dramatic side of the show was nonexistent.With Michael, it was more a case of Steve Carrell knowing this would be his final season.  Thus, it seemed as if the writers didn't (or couldn't) commit to any sort of meaningful character arc for him.  The first half of the season he kind of just bops around aimlessly in his back-and-forth with Holly, while the second half is devoted to feeling out his potential replacements.The one good thing I can say about this season, though, is that--as always--the writers ALWAYS deliver a rock-solid episode when it is absolutely needed.  Much like the Jim/Pam wedding/baby episodes saved last season, the final 2-3 episodes featuring Michael Scott are the only thing keeping my rating from plunging to a measly one star.  In fact, Michael's swan song is perhaps the best single episode in show history (or at least in the running).Thus, though I know I will still be tuning in for Season Eight on NBC next fall, the reasonable part of me says I should probably give up the ghost right now, as I see no way for the show to ever regain the comedic/dramatic gold standard it once held.  With Michael Scott gone and Jim/Pam potentially played out, only a miracle from the writers will keep this show watchable.  Not saying it can't be done, but I think the odds are large against it.",2,This Is Probably Where I Should Jump Off...,1305849600,"05 20, 2011",2011,2339,"['exception', 'potentially', 'Family', 'Guy', 'consider', 'Office', 'be', 'greatest', 'television', 'comedy', 'ever', 'produced', 'Sadly', 'good', 'things', 'must', 'come', 'end', 'eventually', 'seventh', 'season', 'quote', 'more', 'previous', 'six', 'problem', 's', 'Season', 'Seven', ""'ve"", 'always', 'believed', 'entire', 'series', 'hinges', 'three', 'characters', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'Jim', 'Pam', 'form', 'dramatic/emotional', 'backbone', 'show', 'Michael', 'comedic', 'glue', 'everything', 'together', 'other', 'characters', 'wax', 'wane', 'depending', 'episode', 'Big', 'Three', 'more', 'likely', 'course', 'show', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'three', 'character', 'arcs', 'were', 'anywhere', 'top', 'game', 'season.In', 'terms', 'Jim/Pam', 'really', 'carried', 'Sixth', 'Season', 'wedding', 'baby', 'episodes', 'take', 'bit', 'back', 'seat', 'here', 'favor', 'Daryl', 'Andy', 'Erin', 'Gabe', 'providing', 'few', 'moments', 'chuckling', 'humor', 'emotion', 'large', 'dramatic', 'side', 'show', 'was', 'nonexistent.With', 'Michael', 'was', 'more', 'case', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'knowing', 'would', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'Thus', 'seemed', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'could', ""n't"", 'commit', 'sort', 'meaningful', 'character', 'arc', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'kind', 'just', 'bops', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'back-and-forth', 'Holly', 'second', 'half', 'devoted', 'feeling', 'out', 'potential', 'replacements.The', 'one', 'good', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'season', 'though', 'always', 'writers', 'ALWAYS', 'deliver', 'rock-solid', 'episode', 'when', 'absolutely', 'needed', 'Much', 'Jim/Pam', 'wedding/baby', 'saved', 'last', 'season', 'final', '2-3', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'keeping', 'rating', 'plunging', 'measly', 'one', 'star', 'fact', 'Michael', 'swan', 'song', 'perhaps', 'best', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'history', 'least', 'running', '.Thus', 'know', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'tuning', 'Season', 'Eight', 'NBC', 'next', 'fall', 'reasonable', 'part', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'up', 'ghost', 'right', 'now', 'see', 'way', 'show', 'ever', 'regain', 'comedic/dramatic', 'gold', 'standard', 'once', 'held', 'Michael', 'Scott', 'gone', 'Jim/Pam', 'potentially', 'played', 'out', 'only', 'miracle', 'writers', 'will', 'keep', 'show', 'watchable', 'Not', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'think', 'odds', 'are', 'large']",N/A
