She is confronted with a chain smoking political columnist from Chicago, played by John Belushi, who has been banished to the Rockies by his editor.  Belushi just wants to go back to Chicago and Blair Brown is ready to toss him back out into the wilderness when she finds that he has been sent to write a newspaper article about her. I love watching him drag his stiff, chunky body, and an enormous, neon-colored backpack, up the Rockies, cursing and smoking. Meanwhile, his taciturn mountain guide, DeCluse, tells him what he really needs to worry about in the mountains isn't rattlesnakes, but bears, wild men and Blair Brown herself.

What a contrast to his love interest in this movie.  An unlikely couple?  For Sure!  Light romantic comedy is one way to pigeonhole this movie but there is more to it than meets the eye and ear.  Firstly, the cinematography of the Rocky Mountains and the American Bald Eagles is worth the price of admission.  There is some wonderful footage as well of Chicago.  This is a LAWRENCE KASDAN film and he is a master of filming BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN URBAN ARCHITECTURE like Los Angeles inGrand CanyonBoth KASDAN movies, ""Continental Divide"" and ""Grand Canyon"" feature some great cinematography contrasting the urban with the sublime wilderness.  TRITE?  Maybe, in 2008,  but very forwarding looking at the time it was written by Kasdan.One reviewer here wrote that this movie is ""OLD""?  I got a kick out of that.  Believe me, there are many older movies!  Ha HA!Maybe what she meant to say is that the movie isnt aging well and its characteristic of a time period.  That I would agree with.Is it unlikely and unrealistic that Blair Brown could fall so hopelessly in love with John Belushi?  OF COURSE!  But, thats what the movies are all about folks!

733167,A38J4UP79QTJUP,B00008438W,Anthony E. Pomes,"[12, 12]","I've always remembered this movie from when I was a kid and saw it on cable TV. Having seen it again, I think what really makes this film such a sweet and wonderful thing is how the main characters (played by John Belushi and Blair Brown) stay true to themselves as individuals even while falling in love. Without giving too much away here, it's very refreshing to have a romance film in which ""love"" has as much to do with mutual respect and deep caring for another human being as it does with good ol' reliable movie-screen passion. Ernie Souchak (Belushi) and Nell Porter (Brown) have what is considered a far-from-perfect predicament in the game of love, but the way in which they find a solution together makes for one of the sweetest love stories I've ever seen in a movie.Of course, there's no way to watch this film without feeling the sadness and lament over Belushi's too-soon death at age 33. And yet, I think it's really remarkable to see Belushi ""the actor"" overcome some of the jokier elements in the film that I think were included only to appease Belushi fans who wanted yet another variation on Bluto from ANIMAL HOUSE or Capt. ""Wild Bill"" the crazed fighter pilot from Spielberg's 1941. In the end, his commitment to playing a character rather than a cartoon is to be praised and appreciated with a viewing of this special little film.And this film would be the worst kind of insipid without the great actress Blair Brown bringing some very real dimension and humanity to the character of Nell Porter. Bringing undeniable intelligence and unbent courage to the role, her performance reminds viewers how much fun and challenge there is when you fall in love with somebody in real life.One last thing -- I'm standing up here to praise the great character actor Allen Garfield (who changed his name back to Allen Goorwitz by the time he made this film). He plays Ernie Souchak's editor Howard (""a man with a newspaper to run,"" as he tells nearly everyone throughout the film), and his performance is note-perfect. A totally believable human being - Goorwitz lives up to the finest virtues a working actor can achieve. Kudos to him - I will always wish that he had done more films.So if you would like to feel again that this is a pretty darn good planet filled with some pretty darn good people (some of whom want to save eagles), I strongly recommend that you see this movie.

Ernie loves Chicago; he is a true urbanite. When his hard-hitting stories about a corrupt city official bring threats to his life, his editor decides to protect him by sending him on a story out of town...waaay out of town. Ernie is sent to the Rocky Mountains to interview Nell (Blair Brown), a reclusive ornithologist. A huge fish out of water, Ernie struggles against the elements: an overweight chainsmoker in the high altitudes of the Rockies is not a pretty site. Eventually, Ernie finds the lovely Nell, and the city mouse locks horns with the country mouse almost immediately. But circumstances force Nell to take in the reluctant Ernie. As with most films like this, opposites attract, as Ernie does his best to assimulate to Nell's world. But things are heating up back in Chicago, and Ernie must come out of hiding, with Nell in tow, to set things right. Alas, Nell's home is in the mountains with her beloved eagles, so the couple must decide where true love's course will take them.  Belushi is very good as slob-with-a-heart Ernie, proving his comedic charm is just as funny mild as it is wild. Brown is beautiful and appealing.

When one of his stories gets him beat up, his editor decides to send him on an assignment to interview an ""eagle freak"" in the Rocky Mountains played by Blair Brown. In true comedies, the two hate each other at first because of their opposite ways of life but find a common ground to stand on and eventually fall in love.However, as the sparks begin to fly, Belushi returns back to Chicago and after assuring his editor that he is completely over her, she arrives in Chicago to give lectures about eagles and soon rekindles their passion. But the two are left with a tough decision: They both love their work and surroundings and find the other one's surroundings difficult to live in. So what can they do?The language is mild and the violence is mild too. After all, Belushi plays a city boy who must fall down a few times in the mountains and even has to be attacked by a mountain lion. The footage of the mountains is breaktaking and certainly worth the watch. And unlike many love stories where two people are forced together against their wills, this love story seems completely believable because they gain each other's respect first before falling in love.",5,Continental Divide unites two opposites,1336780800,"05 12, 2012",2012,1267,"['John', 'Belushi', 'Chicago', 'reporter', 'lifeblood', 'exposing', 'corrupt', 'politicians', 'dirty', 'cops', 'When', 'one', 'stories', 'beat', 'up', 'editor', 'send', 'assignment', 'interview', 'eagle', 'freak', 'Rocky', 'Mountains', 'played', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'true', 'comedies', 'two', 'hate', 'other', 'first', 'opposite', 'ways', 'life', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'stand', 'eventually', 'fall', 'love.However', 'sparks', 'begin', 'fly', 'Belushi', 'back', 'Chicago', 'assuring', 'editor', 'completely', 'Chicago', 'give', 'lectures', 'eagles', 'soon', 'rekindles', 'passion', 'two', 'are', 'left', 'tough', 'decision', 'love', 'work', 'surroundings', 'find', 'other', 'one', 'surroundings', 'difficult', 'live', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'language', 'mild', 'violence', 'mild', 'too', 'Belushi', 'city', 'boy', 'who', 'must', 'fall', 'down', 'few', 'times', 'mountains', 'even', 'be', 'attacked', 'mountain', 'lion', 'footage', 'mountains', 'breaktaking', 'certainly', 'watch', 'many', 'love', 'stories', 'where', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'together', 'wills', 'love', 'story', 'completely', 'believable', 'gain', 'other', 'respect', 'first', 'falling', 'love']",Continental Divide

It was the only film that ever gave John the chance to play a realistic, believable character whom the viewer could come to know and like, rather than some kind of grotesque caricature who might not even show his eyes to the movie camera.Reviewers at the time who compared John's performance to Spencer Tracy or other classic Hollywood actors were rather missing the point.  This movie allowed John to be a romantic hero while remaining **John Belushi**.  For those of us who have perceived his sensitivity and sweetness in his other work (see, for example, the SNL ""Laundromat"" sketch with Gilda Radner), the result is convincing and moving.

733187,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,B00008438W,Marty Gillis,"[1, 2]","'Continental Divide' is a nice little sleeper of a film that takes me back to the 80's. I've enjoyed it since it's original showing on HBO back in day and purchased this DVD because NONE of my 800 Fios channels show it. Ever!I've always had sort of a soft spot for this film. John Belushi shows us that he can actually ACT and not just make us laugh. (although this film has more than one humorous moment) It's a sweet movie and gives us all a real glimpse at what might have been in store for John Belushi's acting career if he had only survived the 80's.This would be a great title to be released on Blu Ray, but since we only have the DVD I thought it would be good to report on the picture and audio quality for those of you who are wondering about it.So how is the video on this thing anyway?In a word, G R E AT !  For an earlier DVD, the widescreen version (presented in the original aspect ratio with small bars on top and bottom) gives us a stable image (mostly) and the original color timing along with great motion rendering and an almost complete lack of DNR or Edge Enhancement. A bit of dirt and specks here and there along with some healthy grain during darker scenes (but much better than the abysmal '48 Hours"" on Blu ray)IN particular, the colors stand out as VERY pleasing. I never once had the urge to adjust my color temp/saturation controls while watching.I watched this played on my Oppo BDP-95 Blu Ray player which upconverted the video to 1080p, then sent it to a Darbee Darblet for some added detail and contrast enhancement, then to my newly acquired LG LA9700 Ultra High Definition TV. I was worried that up-converting a DVD into almost 4K resolution would be detrimental to the picture quality. I should not have worried. This title up-converts to the highest resolution available today in great form!  Needless to say, I was quite pleased to see this film looking SO GOOD. Better than it ever did on the old HBO showings, and at times ALMOST up to Blu ray standards for older catalog titles.  If this is ever released on Blu Ray, it will be a very good thing indeed!Ok, so the video is very good for standard DVD. How about the sound?We are given a 2.0 stereo mix for 'Continental Divide'. Both music and dialogue are for the most part, clear sounding. The stereo mix is good and provides some nice imaging. Due to the original production sound quality, it is a bit on the flat sounding side.On caveat about the sound: There is a low frequency HUM that is almost constant and is sent to your sub if you have one hooked up. It was so distracting during the quieter portions of the film that I had to just switch it off altogether for this movie. (probably an electrical ground problem during production or during the transfer to DVD)  Bummer.  Otherwise, the audio on this disc is just fine, all things considered.NO special features to speak of, other than the theatrical trailer which is not in the greatest of shape.  That's fine as I bought this for the FILM and anything else would have been nice but is not necessary to enjoy the movie.I am also happy to report this came in an actual HARD SHELL DVD case. No flimsy 'Eco' cases here!Bottom line: If you love John Belushi (or Blair Brown for that matter) or this film in particular, then this purchase should be a real no brainer. The movie is still satisfying , the video is way above average for a DVD and the sound is more than serviceable.'Continental Divide' (currently only available on DVD)  is a MUST for your Belushi collection!Totally recommended by ME, Marty G !",5,Excellent DVD transfer!!,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,3556,"[""'Continental"", 'Divide', 'nice', 'little', 'sleeper', 'film', 'back', '80', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'original', 'showing', 'HBO', 'back', 'day', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'NONE', '800', 'Fios', 'channels', 'show', 'Ever', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'sort', 'soft', 'spot', 'film', 'John', 'Belushi', 'can', 'actually', 'ACT', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'laugh', 'film', 'more', 'one', 'humorous', 'moment', 'sweet', 'movie', 'real', 'glimpse', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'store', 'John', 'Belushi', 'acting', 'career', 'had', 'only', 'survived', ""80's.This"", 'would', 'be', 'great', 'title', 'be', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'only', 'have', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'report', 'picture', 'audio', 'quality', 'who', 'are', 'wondering', 'it.So', 'how', 'video', 'thing', 'anyway', 'word', 'G', 'R', 'E', 'AT', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'version', 'presented', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'small', 'bars', 'top', 'bottom', 'stable', 'image', 'mostly', 'original', 'color', 'timing', 'great', 'motion', 'rendering', 'almost', 'complete', 'lack', 'DNR', 'Edge', 'Enhancement', 'A', 'bit', 'dirt', 'specks', 'here', 'there', 'healthy', 'grain', 'darker', 'scenes', 'much', 'better', 'abysmal', 'Hours', 'Blu', 'ray', 'IN', 'particular', 'colors', 'stand', 'out', 'VERY', 'pleasing', 'never', 'once', 'had', 'urge', 'adjust', 'color', 'temp/saturation', 'controls', 'watching.I', 'watched', 'played', 'Oppo', 'BDP-95', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'player', 'upconverted', 'video', '1080p', 'then', 'sent', 'Darbee', 'Darblet', 'added', 'detail', 'contrast', 'enhancement', 'then', 'newly', 'acquired', 'LG', 'LA9700', 'Ultra', 'High', 'Definition', 'TV', 'was', 'worried', 'up-converting', 'DVD', 'almost', '4K', 'resolution', 'would', 'be', 'detrimental', 'picture', 'quality', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'worried', 'title', 'up-converts', 'highest', 'resolution', 'available', 'today', 'great', 'form', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'quite', 'pleased', 'see', 'film', 'looking', 'SO', 'GOOD', 'Better', 'ever', 'did', 'old', 'HBO', 'showings', 'times', 'ALMOST', 'Blu', 'ray', 'standards', 'older', 'catalog', 'titles', 'ever', 'released', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'indeed', 'Ok', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'standard', 'DVD', 'How', 'sound', 'are', 'given', '2.0', 'stereo', 'mix', ""'Continental"", 'Divide', 'music', 'dialogue', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'clear', 'sounding', 'stereo', 'mix', 'good', 'nice', 'imaging', 'Due', 'original', 'production', 'sound', 'quality', 'bit', 'flat', 'sounding', 'side.On', 'caveat', 'sound', 'low', 'frequency', 'HUM', 'almost', 'constant', 'sent', 'sub', 'have', 'one', 'hooked', 'up', 'was', 'so', 'distracting', 'quieter', 'portions', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'switch', 'off', 'altogether', 'movie', 'probably', 'electrical', 'ground', 'problem', 'production', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'Bummer', 'Otherwise', 'audio', 'disc', 'just', 'fine', 'things', 'considered.NO', 'special', 'features', 'speak', 'other', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'not', 'greatest', 'shape', 'fine', 'bought', 'FILM', 'anything', 'else', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'not', 'necessary', 'enjoy', 'movie.I', 'am', 'also', 'happy', 'report', 'came', 'actual', 'HARD', 'SHELL', 'DVD', 'case', 'flimsy', 'cases', 'here', 'Bottom', 'line', 'love', 'John', 'Belushi', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'matter', 'film', 'particular', 'then', 'purchase', 'should', 'be', 'real', 'brainer', 'movie', 'still', 'satisfying', 'video', 'way', 'average', 'DVD', 'sound', 'more', 'serviceable', ""'Continental"", 'Divide', 'currently', 'only', 'available', 'DVD', 'MUST', 'Belushi', 'collection', 'Totally', 'recommended', 'ME', 'Marty', 'G']",Continental Divide

Kasdan had three films released in 1981 for which he wrote the screenplay.  The most famous was the adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, followed by this romantic comedy, and finally the potboiler film noiresque Body Heat.Continental Divide has been referred to as a modern Hepburn Tracey film.John Belushi plays Ernie Souchok, a no nonsense investigative reporter with a habit of ticking off the wrong people.  Ernie loves Chicago and the big city life. When death threats become a little too real, he is sent on assignment to interview a reclusive ornithologist (bird watcher) living in the Rockies (a.k.a. The Continental Divide).Blair Brown plays Nell Porter, the ornithologist.  She prefers her eagles to other humans.  Therefore, Nell and Ernie mix like oil and water.  But Ernie and Nell realize that their individual passions are what make them attractive to each other.A wild romance ensues but when it is safe for Ernie to return home he reluctantly returns to Chicago.  Of course the two are reunited in Chicago but she is committed to nature.  The end is wildly romantic and completely satisfying.If you like the romantic comedies of the 40's, then Continental Divide is perfection.  John Belushi shows that he had the potential to be a top actor.

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[9, 10]","CONTINENTAL DIVIDE is a sweet, predictable romantic comedy of two opposites who in classic movie fashion can't stand each other at first but then fall madly in love.  Although this is a comedy there is also lots of drama and John Belushi's portrayal of Ernie, an intelligent Chicago investigative reporter, is far from his role as ANIMAL HOUSE'S Bluto or most of his other characters in SNL sketches.  Ernie needs to get out of town for awhile because his investigating has angered some powerful and corrupt politicians.  His editor suggests he hide out in Wyoming and get an interview with Nell, a woman who has been studying bald eagles at her remote mountain top home.  Ernie with his chubbiness and chain smoking is a typical fish out of water in this rugged terrain. He ends up staying at the cabin of the  beautiful self-reliant eagle expert Nell played by Blair Brown who is at first immune to Ernie's charms.  It will come as no surprise to frequent viewers of romantic comedies that after a series of misunderstandings and misadventures Nell and Ernie find they can't live without each other.  Of course there's a problem - her life is in Wyoming protecting and studying the eagles and his is in Chicago protecting the city from corruption.  Aside from the love story the movie offers some beautiful mountain scenery, shots of Chicago that make it look like a glamorous city and views of bald eagles who are thankfully not nearly as endangered as they were in 1981 when the movie was made.

733199,A8ZTPTLGC4755,B00008438W,Terry,"[0, 0]","Continental Divide is a wonderful, albeit underrated Belushi film that was never given a chance by many of his fans.  Belushi plays Ernie Souchak, a Windy City columnist who's speciality is covering the nuances of its city leaders.  Unfortunately, he gets in a little too deep after an investigative column exposes one of the city's aldermans. He is requested by his editor to take a little break from Chicago and concentrate on 'fluff' material for the paper. His assignment is to write an article about naturalist Nell Porter, a woman living in the Rockies studying the bald eagles and its vanishing habitat.I remember this movie from the early 1980s and I love the chemistry between Belushi and Brown. I think it's also because of the repoire the stars have with each other that makes it unique. I also love the cinematography of the land.  Kudos to the producers for choosing such beautiful locations especially now in a when studios prefer CGI settings to actual locations.

Blair Brown's Nell Porter, provides the perfect opposite, for Belushi's Souchak. The film has a very basic &quot;boy meets girl &quot; formula.

733204,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00008438W,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","Like my title blurb says, this is not a comedy with John Belushi, but rather a romantic drama with a few light comedic touches, so if you're looking for some Belushi laughs in the manner of ""The Blues Brothers"" or ""1941"" you'll be sorely disappointed. I'm not a Belushi expert by any means but from what I understand ""Continental Divide"" is one of his only serious roles, and he does it well. It's also one of his last films; a mere five & a half months after the theatrical release John foolishly passed away from drug abuse at the way-too-young age of 33 on March 5, 1982.THE PLOT: Belushi plays Ernie Souchak, a popular Chicago columnist, whose controversial reporting lands him in the hospital. His boss, who wants to get him out of the city, sends him to the scenic Rocky Mountains to interview famous bald eagle researcher Nell Porter, played by the beautiful Blair Brown. Souchak is a city man who chain-smokes, whereas Nell revels in the wilderness and hates jounalists. Will they end up falling in love? And, if so, how can a marriage possibly work if they both insist on remaining in their vastly different worlds so far apart?I'm not a fan of romantic comedies but I will occasional watch romantic dramas like ""Ode to Billy Joe,"" ""The Whole Wide World"" or even ""Love Story."" Although ""Continental Divide"" isn't nearly as serious as those films, it's not a comedy either. There are a few minor laughs, usually tied to Souchak's awkwardness in the wilderness, but that's about it. Although light-hearted, this is indeed a serious film. It's not only entertaining, it surprisingly has a few notable things to say.The most prominent part of the film is the hour or so wherein Souchak goes to the Rockies and stays with Nell. Most men will likely become infatuated with Blair Brown as Souchak falls in love with Nell. I did. Blair was 35 years old at the time of filming (although she appears to be in her early 40s) and has a very earthy look; she never wears make-up and never reveals a lot of flesh. She doesn't need to. She has a strong, independant mindset and yet, at the same time, is very likable and alluring. Her body has the necessary natural roundishness and curves that attract red-blooded men.I heard some reviewers complain about the sequence wherein Nell secretly meets a ultra-stud mountain man (an ex-football player) for a literal roll in the meadow. They argue that this is a meaningless and unneeded sequence. Actually the story is making a statement with this subplot (SPOILER -- if you wanna figure it out on your own don't read the rest of this paragraph): Although Nell would occasionally meet the ultra-macho stud as a sexual outlet in the lonely wilderness, it's obvious she doesn't love the dude in a romantic sense. Their relationship is superficial because it fulfills only one purpose and doesn't go any deeper. As the story progresses Nell falls in love with Souchak, a man who is the antithesis of the studly mountain man in every way. Souchak isn't macho-looking at all; he's only of average height and isn't in very good physical shape. He is, however, an intelligent and expert writer, amongst other things. The message we can glean from this is that men don't have to be ultra-masculine-looking to win the heart of a beautiful woman. And you know what? It's true. Just look around. This is an encouraging message for guys who aren't the ""tall, dark and handsome"" type.The first two times I saw ""Continental Divide"" I felt it was poorly named. Much of the story takes place in the mountains near the Continental Divide, so what? The third time I watched it the title's meaning dawned on me (I know, I'm a doofus): Souchak and Nell's lives are divided by half a continent; how could a long-term relationship possibly work? The ending is surprising and unconventional, but it works.
