991721,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000FK03OI,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[2, 3]","Although this comedy was made in 2004, it is shot in black and white.  In a French town, Gus (Gustave Kervern) is a farmer and a slacker while neighbor  Ben (Benot Del&eacute;pine) has his own problems with his marriage and his love of the motorcross racing.  The two despise each other.  During a physical confrontation between the two, a freak accident occurs.  The  two men end up in the hospital together, both paralyzed and are resigned to wheelchairs.  They embark on a 2,000 mile journey  to Finland to sue the company Aaltra which makes the tractor involved in the accident.It may be slightly confusing during the introduction to their dilemna, but the majority of the film takes place after the accident,  Moreoften, hitchhiking is the method of travel.  It is a long journey and the people they encounter along the way provide some amusing scenes.There is not a lot of dialogue, the subtitles are easy to read.  English is frequently used, and French/Belgium are the languages.  At times, you may think translation is missing, but it is not, it has to do with the storyline.  The  stiff dry humor is black comedy, from  subtle to downright hilarious scenes.  One scene in particular is when Ben takes off on  motorcross bike while the owner is furious and with the usual profanity in English,  shouting ""you give people in wheelchairs a bad name.""  Another is listening to a man sing the popular 60's hit ""Sonny"" in a karoake bar.Comedians who play the lead characters, Gus and Ben wrote and directed the movie.  The movie is presented by Film Movement, an organization that distributes fine foreign film that focuses on good acting, good writing and directing.  .... This film won several film festival awards.

991722,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B000FK03OI,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","The saddest thing about this Belgian film (in Belgian French, subtitled for what it's worth) is not that the two main characters end up wheelchair-bound; it is that I could tell you the whole darned thing in an unusually short time.These two bozos, neighbors who hate each other, end up in a bitter brawl that leaves them pinned by one of the neighbor's farm machinery. Both end up in hospital - in the same room - and both emerge in wheelchairs for life. That is when things get really strange. An inexplicable abandonment of their respective houses, and a trip to Finland with a shocking outcome, pretty much explains this Belgian 'black comedy'.Except it's heavy on the ""black"" and virtually without comedy.While it has one or two intensely hilarious moments (these two guys are both unbelievably obnoxious and mean), this black-and-white film seems to consist mostly of random cinematic compositions. It's the type of thing I always imagined they assigned to film school students in cinematography 101 or earlier.The black-and-white is tough enough to bear, though I see its reasons. What I cannot bear is that the film MAKES the viewer laugh at people in wheelchairs. When one random fellow screams, ""It's people like you who give people in wheelchairs a bad name!!"" I immediately thought how true of the filmmakers.This is a 90 minute waste, a strung-together 'cripple' jokebook that in the end is not funny at all. As a man crippled and wheelchair-bound for life, I found it funny as hell in one scene only (see if you spot that scene). It's easy for me to empathize with that anger, grief and a thirst for some sort of vengeance. Yet it is somehow frightening to see it in such mocking detail, and it is because of that I decided to warn viewers away from this thing.All of that, and the fact that this is about two stupid men who put themselves in wheelchairs in the first place.As a wheelchair-bound person, I did not find much sympathy with anything in this film. There is an important symbolism here which ends up being represented by two dolts in wheelchairs. Of course they are enraged about it, which I definitely was when I first landed in my chair. However, one ironclad rule I have: an important message deserves an important delivery system, which this film is NOT.If you want laughs and tears of revolt, Euro-style (read: all the wrong kinds), get the originalDeath at a Funeral (2007). And by the way, Mr. Interlocutor of my original review: it's pretty clear that I not only love cinema but am also something of a historian on the subject - and a definite expert of THIS subject.",2,"""AALTRA is a knock-off of VALTRA"" (as in ""this thing is a knock-off of film"")",1303084800,"04 18, 2011",2011,2601,"['saddest', 'thing', 'Belgian', 'film', 'Belgian', 'French', 'subtitled', 'what', 'worth', 'not', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'wheelchair-bound', 'could', 'tell', 'whole', 'darned', 'thing', 'unusually', 'short', 'time.These', 'two', 'bozos', 'neighbors', 'who', 'hate', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'bitter', 'brawl', 'pinned', 'one', 'neighbor', 'farm', 'machinery', 'end', 'up', 'hospital', 'same', 'room', 'emerge', 'wheelchairs', 'life', 'when', 'things', 'get', 'really', 'strange', 'inexplicable', 'abandonment', 'respective', 'houses', 'trip', 'Finland', 'shocking', 'outcome', 'pretty', 'much', 'Belgian', ""'black"", ""comedy'.Except"", 'heavy', 'black', 'virtually', 'comedy.While', 'one', 'two', 'intensely', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'two', 'guys', 'are', 'unbelievably', 'obnoxious', 'mean', 'black-and-white', 'film', 'consist', 'mostly', 'random', 'cinematic', 'compositions', 'type', 'thing', 'always', 'imagined', 'assigned', 'film', 'school', 'students', 'cinematography', '101', 'earlier.The', 'black-and-white', 'tough', 'enough', 'bear', 'see', 'reasons', 'What', 'can', 'not', 'bear', 'film', 'MAKES', 'viewer', 'laugh', 'people', 'wheelchairs', 'When', 'one', 'random', 'fellow', 'screams', 'people', 'who', 'give', 'people', 'bad', 'name', 'immediately', 'thought', 'how', 'true', 'filmmakers.This', '90', 'minute', 'waste', 'strung-together', ""'cripple"", 'jokebook', 'end', 'not', 'funny', 'man', 'crippled', 'wheelchair-bound', 'life', 'found', 'as', 'hell', 'one', 'scene', 'only', 'see', 'spot', 'scene', 'easy', 'empathize', 'anger', 'grief', 'thirst', 'sort', 'vengeance', 'somehow', 'frightening', 'see', 'such', 'mocking', 'detail', 'decided', 'warn', 'viewers', 'away', 'thing.All', 'fact', 'about', 'two', 'stupid', 'men', 'who', 'put', 'wheelchairs', 'first', 'place.As', 'wheelchair-bound', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'much', 'sympathy', 'anything', 'film', 'important', 'symbolism', 'here', 'up', 'being', 'represented', 'two', 'dolts', 'wheelchairs', 'course', 'are', 'enraged', 'definitely', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'landed', 'chair', 'However', 'one', 'ironclad', 'rule', 'have', 'important', 'message', 'important', 'delivery', 'system', 'film', 'NOT.If', 'want', 'laughs', 'tears', 'revolt', 'Euro-style', 'read', 'wrong', 'kinds', 'get', 'originalDeath', 'Funeral', '2007', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Interlocutor', 'original', 'review', 'pretty', 'clear', 'not', 'only', 'love', 'cinema', 'am', 'also', 'something', 'historian', 'subject', 'definite', 'expert', 'THIS', 'subject']",Aaltra
991723,ACX80IV6CGBZ0,B000FK03OI,Gagewyn,"[7, 8]","Aaltra follows two neighboring men, one a farmer and one a telecommuting business man who lives for motocross.  They have a bit of a feud going on, which culminates in a fistfight on the farmer's Aaltra tractor and both men being paralyzed from the waist down.  The farmer directss his bitterness at the tractor that paralyzed them both and sets off for Finland to find the factory.  The business man decides to go across Europe and watch motocross competitions.  They both leave for their trips the same day and their paths keep crossing, much to the chagrin of each, until they finally begin to travel together.This movie was laugh out loud funny for me.  It pokes fun at society all the way through.  The two men are both unpleasant.  When their wallets are stolen the farmer attempts to mug passersby, while the business man attempts to block parked vehicles and charge a fee to get out of the way.  One even steals an old lady's motorized wheelchair.  They use their wheelchair bound status to stay overnight with a German family as it dawns on the family that they are being milked for free beers.Other reviews talk about slow pacing.  I didn't find this to be the case.  There are long shots, but for a reason.  For example, long shots of the German family watching the men eat, as the men snap it up and the family grows increasingly pissed off but tries to be polite.  There is always something going on.This is the most hilarious movie I have seen in a while.  It's well worth finding a copy.

991724,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B000FK03OI,Margaux Paschke,"[5, 6]","This little known gem of a French movie is dark yet funny.  We are introduced to two neighbors who do not like each other too much, but then, most people don't seem to like them either.  An accident occurs while they are arguing and they are both paralyzed.  Their disability did not make them better people.  They decide to go to Aaltra (a factory in Finland) to make them pay for producing faulty tractors, the cause of their accident and so their roadtrip begins....The men are robbed while waiting for the next train and now, have no way of getting to Finland.  They decide to try and take advantage of being disabled with hilarious to demeaning results.  This movie showed the full spectrum of the their new ""disabled"" life.  People can be cruel to them and they are cruel back but they do manage to laugh and make the audience laugh as well.  Throughout it all, the two men remain focused on their goal - Aaltra, Finland.They do manage to get to Aaltra but I cannot give the end away without ruining the movie.  This road trip to Aaltra was sorta like the yellow brick road to their personal salvation, which they do receive but not in the way they expected.  I can not recommend this movie enough if you don't mind subtitles (minor note, I wonder why the subtitles were a little off when foul language was used).  It is an extraordinary film.  Although it won a few awards at the lesser Film Festivals, it deserved better distribution and maybe the dvd will allow this movie the greater audience it deserves.",5,Road Trip with Wheelchairs,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1515,"['little', 'known', 'gem', 'French', 'movie', 'dark', 'yet', 'funny', 'are', 'introduced', 'two', 'neighbors', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'other', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'like', 'either', 'accident', 'are', 'arguing', 'are', 'paralyzed', 'disability', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'people', 'decide', 'go', 'Aaltra', 'factory', 'Finland', 'make', 'pay', 'producing', 'faulty', 'tractors', 'cause', 'accident', 'so', 'roadtrip', '.The', 'men', 'are', 'robbed', 'waiting', 'next', 'train', 'now', 'have', 'way', 'getting', 'Finland', 'decide', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'being', 'disabled', 'hilarious', 'demeaning', 'results', 'movie', 'showed', 'full', 'spectrum', 'new', 'disabled', 'life', 'People', 'can', 'be', 'cruel', 'are', 'cruel', 'back', 'do', 'manage', 'laugh', 'make', 'audience', 'laugh', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'men', 'remain', 'focused', 'goal', 'Aaltra', 'Finland.They', 'do', 'manage', 'get', 'Aaltra', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'end', 'away', 'ruining', 'movie', 'road', 'trip', 'Aaltra', 'was', 'sorta', 'yellow', 'brick', 'road', 'personal', 'salvation', 'do', 'receive', 'not', 'way', 'expected', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'enough', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'subtitles', 'minor', 'note', 'wonder', 'why', 'subtitles', 'were', 'little', 'off', 'when', 'foul', 'language', 'was', 'used', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'won', 'few', 'awards', 'lesser', 'Film', 'Festivals', 'deserved', 'better', 'distribution', 'maybe', 'dvd', 'will', 'allow', 'movie', 'greater', 'audience']",Aaltra

Two rather unlikeable characters have an altercation that result in both becoming wheelchair bound.  They have to spend time together in the same hospital room, then without coordinated discussion, decide to seek out the manufacturer of the farm implement that caused their injuries and seek compensation.  Most of the film revolves around this trip.  But everything, I mean everything, seems to happen in slow motion.  Here's an example.  When they are being transported home in separate ambulances following their hospital stay, the drivers stop for a drink.  As a slow, one-sided conversation occurs between the drivers, every so often a hand reaches up from out of sight, recognized as coming from one of the guys in a wheelchair, lifts a beer glass, takes it below the height of the bar, then returns it to the bar with less beer than before.That's 5 minutes. It was an effective technique for a subtle humor the first time, but it seemed the whole movie was a collection of these slow, laborious vignettes.
