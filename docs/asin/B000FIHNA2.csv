White,"[4, 4]","Before I buy or even review a movie from amazon.com I always read the 1 star reviews first so that I may have a fuller understanding of both sides.  The ""bad""reviews said this was not an uplifting movie, that the Christianity is questionable and that no examples of Christ were present.Well to be honest, no, this was not an uplifting movie, but it wasn't intended to be.  It was an in your face realization that we don't do enough in the way of homeless, drug abuse, and at risk youth in our communities.  The main point of this movie is to become doers of the Word and not just listeners.  Get involved with local charities or homeless shelters.  Rolling down the window and giving spare change or a dollar is good, but it doesn't have a lasting impact on you.  This movie shows what happens when you get involved.I believe this movie held up it's Christian values.  The church was open to anyone that wanted to change.  From hookers to gang members, the church did not turn their back.In a example of Christ, a boy that wanted out of a gang had to have a ritual beating.  But it as a friend that step in and took that beating for him.  He was put in the hospital the beating was so bad, but he did it out of love.I believe we hear about Jesus at church, but to find him, you have to leave your comfort zone.  In closing, yes Michael W.

990852,ATKL8C5IQ56E9,B000FIHNA2,Amazon Customer,"[0, 1]","I only bought this movie because I got it at a bargain price.  Much to my surprise, I really liked it.  I do object to the profanity in it; mild by today's standards, but then again, Christians are not to follow ""today's"" standards but God's; the Bible, not ""realism""-- Especially pastors.  I hope this does not become a trend in Christian films.  Also, I would have liked a gospel presentation of some sort to have been worked into the film.That said, I do think the film was well acted and had a good message; even MWS was believable. MWS plays a white yuppie preacher's kid who goes to an inner city black church  ""to observe"". Both the black pastor and the white yuppie have stereotyped notions about each other and race relations within the church.  These barriers eventually break down somewhat and both come to a better understanding of ""the other side"".  The white yuppie learns that money is not always enough and the black pastor realized that not all whites are the enemy.  A related subplot is mega church's emphasis on money over people--how far do we go?I would have given it 5 stars if not for the cussing and lack of a clear gospel message.",3,Better than I thought it would be,1197676800,"12 15, 2007",2007,1156,"['only', 'bought', 'movie', 'got', 'bargain', 'price', 'Much', 'surprise', 'really', 'liked', 'do', 'object', 'profanity', 'mild', 'today', 'standards', 'then', 'again', 'Christians', 'are', 'not', 'follow', 'today', 'standards', 'God', 'Bible', 'not', 'realism', 'Especially', 'pastors', 'hope', 'not', 'become', 'trend', 'Christian', 'films', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'gospel', 'presentation', 'sort', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'film.That', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'had', 'good', 'message', 'even', 'MWS', 'was', 'believable', 'MWS', 'white', 'yuppie', 'preacher', 'kid', 'who', 'inner', 'city', 'black', 'church', 'observe', 'black', 'pastor', 'white', 'yuppie', 'have', 'stereotyped', 'notions', 'other', 'race', 'relations', 'church', 'barriers', 'eventually', 'break', 'down', 'somewhat', 'come', 'better', 'understanding', 'other', 'side', 'white', 'yuppie', 'learns', 'money', 'not', 'always', 'enough', 'black', 'pastor', 'realized', 'not', 'whites', 'are', 'enemy', 'related', 'subplot', 'mega', 'church', 'emphasis', 'money', 'people', 'how', 'far', 'do', 'go', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'cussing', 'lack', 'clear', 'gospel', 'message']",The Second Chance

990856,A3P876I6K3KL8V,B000FIHNA2,C. Long,"[1, 1]","I have a few beefs with this movie, including one somewhat notable one. But before I get to them, let's start with what's great about this movie, and top of the list is its overall message.Through a story that melds a black inner-city pastor with his church together with a white pastor from a ""rich suburban"" church, this is a very challenging movie for The Church as a whole in America, that probably would (and probably should) make much of the American Church feel very uncomfortable. This movie hits close to home, folks, and will really get you to thinking about how much of our Christianity is a ""show"" vs. how much is really loving and caring for others. This movie showcases some of this stuff in very poignant ways and you might be surprised just how revealing it is, both of the Church as a whole, and of yourself - it might just hit you between the eyes (it did to me). It's so easy to just want to throw money on a problem so you don't have to ""get personally involved"" - but there's a big difference between handing out money and committing yourself to service - to really living out the servant life of love that we are called to as Christians. That is the core of what this movie is about, which it tells in an engaging and interesting story.The acting and production quality are great and much better than I expected. I admit to initially being a tad concerned when I saw that Michael W. Smith was playing a lead because in my mind I thought that no matter how great a musician he is, his inclusion as a lead probably was going to mean some pretty cheesy acting. I was definitely wrong - he carried himself just fine, as did the rest of the cast. The story was perfectly believable (which while good of course, given the subject matter, is also sad) and it was clearly well-directed.Now to the concerns: This is a gritty movie that is not what typically would spring to mind if you think ""Christian movie"" - it has some bad language and a bit of violence. It is PG-13 for a reason. The language itself didn't grandly bother me (it's not horrible - many PG movies have just as bad) and it is within the context of the inner-city life, but what DID really bother me was that one of the characters doing the cussing was the inner-city black pastor who in many ways the film builds up as someone to look up to. I really see absolutely no movie benefit at all to them having the ""man of God"" doing cussing (and noted in the movie itself as having a cussing problem), but rather I see it as a strong negative. I know that some pastors cuss, etc. in real-life, but I don't need to see someone on screen that we're supposed to be looking up to (and is busy delivering many of the thoughtful punchlines of the movie) portrayed this way - I see no benefit to that at all. It just muddies (and muddles) things in a way that isn't good. With that said, the problematic language by the pastor or otherwise was relatively little all things considered. I tend to be pretty sensitive these days to bad language, but this movie didn't leave me feeling dirty in that regards, etc.My other concern with this movie simply stems from the ending and lack of real resolution. Part of me thinks they did this on purpose to kind of leave the viewer with the feeling that ""and on and on this goes""...But what might have been nice artistically or philosophically, wasn't satisfying as a MOVIE ending. Without giving the ending away, although it strongly hints at things turning out well on a couple of different fronts, you don't get to really see it. It's just that nothing gets fully resolved. You don't see the suburban church board changing their mind (and hearts), and you don't feel an emotional resolution with the characters you've been invested in for 2 hours, and thus, as mentioned, you kind of are left feeling ""and on and on everything goes"". It's not a horrible ending (I've seen worse) but it just isn't how you really WANT to see it on screen. Then again, life, much like this movie, doesn't always work out how we'd like to see. Sometimes what might be best from an artistic perspective just isn't what your emotions really want to see (feel) happen.Those two issues aside (cussing pastor and lack of satisfying resolution), this is still a worthwhile movie that you will likely be highly glad you watched, if for no other reason than the great messages it showcases in such clear terms. It is largely because of the messages, combined with high production value, that I've rated this as high as I have despite its flaws.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",5,Pretty good movie that will challenge you,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,4598,"['have', 'few', 'beefs', 'movie', 'including', 'one', 'somewhat', 'notable', 'one', 'get', 'let', 'start', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'top', 'list', 'overall', 'story', 'black', 'inner-city', 'pastor', 'church', 'together', 'white', 'pastor', 'rich', 'suburban', 'church', 'very', 'challenging', 'movie', 'Church', 'whole', 'America', 'probably', 'would', 'probably', 'should', 'make', 'much', 'American', 'Church', 'feel', 'very', 'uncomfortable', 'movie', 'close', 'home', 'folks', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'thinking', 'how', 'much', 'Christianity', 'show', 'vs.', 'how', 'much', 'really', 'loving', 'caring', 'others', 'movie', 'stuff', 'very', 'poignant', 'ways', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'just', 'how', 'revealing', 'Church', 'whole', 'might', 'just', 'hit', 'eyes', 'did', 'so', 'easy', 'just', 'want', 'throw', 'money', 'problem', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'get', 'personally', 'involved', 'big', 'difference', 'handing', 'out', 'money', 'committing', 'service', 'really', 'living', 'out', 'servant', 'life', 'love', 'are', 'called', 'Christians', 'core', 'what', 'movie', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'story.The', 'acting', 'production', 'quality', 'are', 'great', 'much', 'better', 'expected', 'admit', 'initially', 'being', 'tad', 'concerned', 'when', 'saw', 'Michael', 'W.', 'Smith', 'was', 'playing', 'lead', 'mind', 'thought', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'musician', 'inclusion', 'lead', 'probably', 'was', 'going', 'mean', 'pretty', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'was', 'definitely', 'wrong', 'carried', 'just', 'fine', 'did', 'rest', 'cast', 'story', 'was', 'perfectly', 'believable', 'good', 'course', 'given', 'subject', 'matter', 'also', 'sad', 'was', 'clearly', 'well-directed.Now', 'concerns', 'gritty', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'typically', 'would', 'spring', 'mind', 'think', 'Christian', 'movie', 'bad', 'language', 'bit', 'violence', 'PG-13', 'reason', 'language', 'did', ""n't"", 'grandly', 'bother', 'not', 'horrible', 'many', 'PG', 'movies', 'have', 'just', 'bad', 'context', 'inner-city', 'life', 'what', 'DID', 'really', 'bother', 'was', 'one', 'characters', 'doing', 'cussing', 'was', 'inner-city', 'black', 'pastor', 'who', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'up', 'someone', 'look', 'up', 'really', 'see', 'absolutely', 'movie', 'benefit', 'having', 'man', 'God', 'doing', 'cussing', 'noted', 'movie', 'having', 'cussing', 'problem', 'rather', 'see', 'strong', 'negative', 'know', 'pastors', 'cuss', 'etc', 'real-life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'someone', 'screen', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'looking', 'up', 'busy', 'delivering', 'many', 'thoughtful', 'punchlines', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'way', 'see', 'benefit', 'just', 'muddies', 'muddles', 'things', 'way', ""n't"", 'good', 'said', 'problematic', 'language', 'pastor', 'otherwise', 'was', 'relatively', 'little', 'things', 'considered', 'tend', 'be', 'pretty', 'sensitive', 'days', 'bad', 'language', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'feeling', 'dirty', 'regards', 'etc.My', 'other', 'concern', 'movie', 'simply', 'ending', 'lack', 'real', 'resolution', 'Part', 'did', 'purpose', 'kind', 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'artistically', 'philosophically', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfying', 'MOVIE', 'ending', 'giving', 'ending', 'away', 'strongly', 'things', 'turning', 'out', 'well', 'couple', 'different', 'fronts', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'really', 'see', 'just', 'nothing', 'fully', 'resolved', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'suburban', 'church', 'board', 'changing', 'mind', 'hearts', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'emotional', 'resolution', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'invested', '2', 'hours', 'thus', 'mentioned', 'kind', 'are', 'left', 'feeling', 'everything', 'not', 'horrible', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', 'just', ""n't"", 'how', 'really', 'WANT', 'see', 'screen', 'Then', 'again', 'life', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'out', 'how', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'Sometimes', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'artistic', 'perspective', 'just', ""n't"", 'what', 'emotions', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'feel', 'happen.Those', 'two', 'issues', 'aside', 'cussing', 'pastor', 'lack', 'satisfying', 'resolution', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'highly', 'glad', 'watched', 'other', 'reason', 'great', 'messages', 'such', 'clear', 'terms', 'largely', 'messages', 'combined', 'high', 'production', 'value', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'as', 'high', 'have', 'flaws.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",The Second Chance

In those moments of loneliness, when the television cant fill your time. You sometimes turn to the voices that make so much sense. For me it was Michael W. Smith and Steve Taylor. Smith I discovered when I was 10. His album Go West Young Man wore out my cassette player. I knew every word and sang every song, Id even put on silly little concerts in my room. The simple lyrics touched me, encouraged me, and I also found that at Bible camp if you can learn all those Michael W. Smith songs the girls will pay attention to you. My early teens were shaped by these lyrics and forever changed my world view.But alas we grow up, my Christian tapes were thrown into a drawer and Nine Inch Nails and Nirvana became the music I rocked out too. I really started doubting if any of this religion stuff was worth a hill of beans and then Christmas 1994 came and I opened a brightly colored package that had an unusual video in it. It was Steve Taylors concept video called ""NOW THE TRUTH CAN BE TOLD"" it introduced me to a man who was one part Lenny Bruce, One part the Clash, and three parts John the Baptist. Steve Taylor was the one man I wanted to be like, the one man whose music answered questions and convicted me. I tell you I never would have survived my teenage years without him and weve never even met.Then I grew up I got into Christian Radio and I have had an opportunity to meet many of the stars in the genre. Ive eaten lunch with Greg Long, had Bart Millard sign a banana I sold on Ebay, and Im on hugging terms with Steven Curtis Chapman. But when I got to meet Michael W. Smith at Radio City Music Hall, all I could say over and over again was it was an honor to meet you as my knees shook. I had become a thirteen year boy again. Dont ask me about what happened when I sat five feet away from Steve Taylor at a lunch sponsored by the film Im about to review. I was stuck in some pointless icebreaker exercise and I thought it would be rude to jump up and cause a scene, also I was shaking so much I dont know what I would have said if I met him anyway. So alas I havent gotten to talk to him yet. But one day I may be able too and that would be awesome.All this to say I have been eagerly awaiting THE SECOND CHANCE. A film that was written and directed by Taylor and starring Smith. Imagine my two childhood heroes making a film together. It was too much for me to bear. Unfortunately my job pulled me away from the New Jersey premiere so I borrowed the DVD screener from work and watched it with my wife as the New York Metropolitan area got hit with 2 feet of snow.THE SECOND CHANCE follows Ethan Jenkins (Michael W. Smith) a suburban pastor whose life is just getting comfortable. He had a successful recording career that ended in rehab, and has since taken the associate pastor gig at The Rock, his fathers mega-church deep in the heart of suburbia. When Ethans methods get in the way of the church boards plans he is sent to The Second Chance Community Church. Its a small inner city church Ethans father started when Ethan was a child and hes there to learn and observe. Second Chance is in the middle of the inner city and is presided over by Pastor Jake (Jeff Carr), a former pro basketball player who is trying to save his community from the plight of gangs and drugs. Its an uphill battle and he sees Ethan as just another suburban do-gooder that will leave when the going gets tough. Can these men work together? Will Ethan stick with Pastor Jake? Or will other insidious plans cause a rift in the hood?THE SECOND CHANCE is a film with very lofty goals. Its a film that reveals one of the biggest problems that is plaguing the Christian Church in America: racial and class seperation. There is a problem with terms like ""Black Church"" and ""White Church."" and ""Rich Church"" and ""Poor Church."" Theyre false. There is only one church and we all should be invited. Ethan and Jake are two souls caught in the middle. Ethan is out of his comfort zone at Second Chance and Jake is tired of the Suburban church throwing money at his neighborhood problems and not helping out. Does the Second Chance film succeed in opening our eyes to the problems in our own backyard? It does.Director Taylor fills his film with rich colorful characters. But at times his actors cant get into them. For instance I particularly loved the sassy women playing the choir leader. She has such a small role and yet she fills it with color and realism. Other performers just arent as skilled and the dialogues they have sound like dialogue and not real life conversations.As for the two leads, Smith and Carr give competent performances. Both are first time film actors and against the odds grow into their characters. There are a few moments early on that felt a little wooden but as the film progresses I bought their relationship, and them as the characters.The major flaw with the film is the long winded first act. The script dumps a lot of plot conflict on the story and the long walk around the hood confused me a little. But then there is this scene with Smith, a small child, and a paper plate. WOW! Taylor and Smith nail it. This was a small moment in a lot of disjointed clutter that was perfect. I hoped for more honest moments like that and they definitely came. If you are a Christian and are not moved by the foot washing scene that comes later in the film Id doubt your faith (oh Im just kidding).I also liked that the film had a good natured sense of humor. There were moments when I saw Taylors wit and good natured ribbing poking out. Trust me you wont look at prayer and a lottery ticket the same way again.But how will this admittedly ""Christian Film"" play to the unchurched masses? I dont really know. It feels more like an exhortation to the Christian Community and I wonder how someone on the outside would be able to follow it. That is not a negative. If this film gets the Christian community to enter into a discussion about how to fix a great divide between the rich and poor, between the Black Church and the White Church, then I applaud it. But it is also a good look into what goes on inside the Christian community and may cause those who dont quite understand to ask questions and there is nothing wrong with dialogue.THE SECOND CHANCE is not a perfect film, but it tries and it has guts. Moreover its watchable and more importantly honest. I liked it an applaud all involved. Now everyone go to Amazon.com and clean them out of Chagall Guevara CDs, this was Taylors early 90's rock band. Trust me its the greatest album ever",3,"THE SECOND CHANCE is not a perfect film, but it tries and it has guts",1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,6649,"['When', 'youre', 'Christian', 'boy', 'whos',

As a result, most people who aren't Christians avoid these movies, leaving the films solely ""preaching to the choir."" To the contrary, ""The Second Chance"" is a groundbreaking film in that it leaves the salvation message alone and instead tackles the role that Christians and the Church should take in our communities.Rather than re-hash the plot and characters, which have been covered amply in many other Amazon reviews, I'd rather examine the strengths and weaknesses in ""The Second Chance."" Fortunately, there are far more strengths than weaknesses, despite a first-time director (Steve Taylor) and star (Michael W. Smith).On the plus side, the flow of the action and the plot are well above average. Instead of covering the typical Christian ground of salvation or the Second Coming, this film delves into an American inner-city, complete with gangs and opportunist politicians. The characterizations are gritty, and the dialogue is real. ""The Second Chance"" is also about the right length, so viewers won't have much of a chance to get bored.On the other hand, some of the acting is a little wooden, especially some of the members of Pastor Jake's congregation. Michael W. Smith also takes a little while during the film to settle into his role, though his performance is largely believable.Using a balance scale, ""The Second Chance"" is more than satisfying. It provokes viewers to compare themselves with the people they see in the movie and ask themselves what they would do in those situations. Movie viewers may tend to avoid most Christian films, but that would be a mistake in this case.

Though there is a unifying reconciliation theme running through the movie, it is largely character-driven with an assortment of characters with different personal issues that makes for a multi-faceted storyline that is paradoxically very intimate, as it addresses individuals, yet also very big-picture, as it raises questions about how to deal with local and global societal challenges, the role of money and power in society and the Church, and how best to love God by loving man.Plot:  Comfy suburban White megachurch meets in-the-trenches urban community Black church, and drama happens.  Michael W. Smith stars as Ethan (""Gucci"") the White associate pastor forced by his church board to ""do time"" observing and learning from experience with the Black church's Pastor Jake, convincingly played by jeff obafemi carr.  With light humor, the movie focuses on the personal and relational transformations of Gucci and Jake as they meet such PG-13 urban challenges as poverty, stereotypes, addictions, physical abuse, gangs, and drugs.The situations depicted ring true, and I could relate every character and situation from this movie to personal experience.  Though the life struggles addressed are fairly common knowledge, such unpleasant realities are often blocked out or tucked away, and this film is a reminder to stay on spiritual track, remembering one's first love and to  serve even as Jesus came to serve.  The scene that impacted me the most, and which probably will stay with me, involves a youth pastor caring for one of his sheep to the uttermost.

Though billed as something other than the churchy norm, the obvious setting of churches and pastors and pews made this an easy film for non-churchgoers to avoid.Which is too bad, really.  This is a movie worth being watched and discussed by those inside and out of ""the fold.""Steve Taylor's story addresses issues of racism, class, hypocricy, and spiritual arrogance--and shows that all of these things exist on both sides of the economic/religious tracks.  The story revolves around two pastors, both from similar church backgrounds, but having gone vastly different ways in their purposes and styles of ministry.  When the rising suburban ""pop star"" pastor begins to truly involve himself in the community of his urban counterpart, his motives are tested.  The relationship between the two ministers gets off to a rocky start, and, thanks to Taylor's directing, never seems too easily resolved.  Eventually, they are challenged to find reconciliation by unexpected sources.The photography in the film is nicely done.  The acting drew me into each of the characters' lives (Carr is great, and yes, Michael W. Smith pulls off his parts with surprising ease and credibility).  The music is understated, yet fitting.  Although I would've liked to see a bit more grittiness in the gang-related scenes, I think the story captured the basics of urban life.  And those who have complaints about any brief swear words are apparently far removed from the much harsher language that goes on in such settings.Sure, the movie has a few glitches, but it has many things to be commended.

990866,A2FTFUIGAFL63Z,B000FIHNA2,"F. Bailey ""NYC Black Christian""","[6, 12]","This movie was pretty good but I had a couple of problems with it.  I don't know if I could truly say this was a Christian movie because it had curses in it.  Maybe it shows how far the church has gotten away from its roots.  One of the main characters in the film is a preacher who has a problem with swearing.  I mean he even does it in the pulpit.  I know we all have our shortcomings, but I don't see how a Christian movie can have a cursing preacher because a preacher is supposed to be a trained orator.  If you have a problem with cursing - especially when you're in the pulpit, then you have no business being licensed to preach.  It may convey the message that in certain situations, using foul language and physical violence to solve problems is ok.  But the weapons of our warfare are not carnal.The cursing is not really excessive and I have seen other movies with Christian overtones such as ""The Apostle"" or ""The Fighting Temptations"" that had cursing in them and I didn't have a problem with them because that's what one would expect.  But this is supposed to be a Christian movie and should be judged by higher standards.The other problem I had with the movie was that it had about 3 or 4 unresolved issues.  I think it should have been about a half hour longer so we could know what happened with certain characters, but that was left to our imaginations.  And right at a very important point in the movie, it just ended.  It almost seems like the producer ran out of money and didn't finish the movie but they put it out anyway.Other than that, the movie was good.  The acting was good and it didn't have that low budget Christian movie feel to it.  It brought out some important issues concerning racism, church operations and politics, and classism that are so prevalent in today's Christian church.  I didn't look at the clock once during the movie so I guess I can say that it wasn't boring at all.I guess this movie would be ok to show to your Christian friends at home because it does bring out some good valid points, but please, not in the sanctuary.",3,Not one I'd show in the church sanctuary.,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,2076,"['movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'couple', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'could', 'truly', 'say', 'was', 'Christian', 'movie', 'had', 'curses', 'Maybe', 'how', 'far', 'church', 'gotten', 'away', 'roots', 'One', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'preacher', 'who', 'problem', 'swearing', 'mean', 'even', 'pulpit', 'know', 'have', 'shortcomings', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'Christian', 'movie', 'can', 'have', 'cursing', 'preacher', 'preacher', 'supposed', 'be', 'trained', 'orator', 'have', 'problem', 'cursing', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'pulpit', 'then', 'have', 'business', 'being', 'licensed', 'preach', 'may', 'convey', 'message', 'certain', 'situations', 'using', 'foul', 'language', 'physical', 'violence', 'solve', 'problems', 'ok', 'weapons', 'warfare', 'are', 'not', 'carnal.The', 'cursing', 'not', 'really', 'excessive', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'Christian', 'overtones', 'such', 'Apostle', 'Fighting', 'Temptations', 'had', 'cursing', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'what', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'supposed', 'be', 'Christian', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'judged', 'higher', 'standards.The', 'other', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'had', '3', '4', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'half', 'hour', 'longer', 'could', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'certain', 'characters', 'was', 'left', 'imaginations', 'right', 'very', 'important', 'point', 'movie', 'just', 'ended', 'almost', 'producer', 'ran', 'money', 'did', ""n't"", 'finish', 'movie', 'put', 'out', 'anyway.Other', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'low', 'budget', 'Christian', 'movie', 'feel', 'brought', 'out', 'important', 'issues', 'concerning', 'racism', 'church', 'operations', 'politics', 'classism', 'are', 'so', 'prevalent', 'today', 'Christian', 'church', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'clock', 'once', 'movie', 'so', 'guess', 'can', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'all.I', 'guess', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'ok', 'show', 'Christian', 'friends', 'home', 'bring', 'out', 'good', 'valid', 'points', 'please', 'not', 'sanctuary']",The Second Chance

This is where, a church gets so established that the systems are put into place and everything becomes mechanised. At this point a ministry loses its soul, and its passion.This is the heart of the Laodicean Church (Revelation 3:14-19). They had everything in the natural, but in the spiritual they were really blind, poor and naked. The main church of the founders get the shock of their lives when they are reproached by their minister from the poor and struggling sister church.As a result, Ethan (Michael W.

Pastor Ethan (of The Second Chance Church's central church branch) isn't easy to get along with, whatwith his clicheing mind and how he thinks Pastor Jake handles the ruffians of his neighborhood. And by ruffians, I mean the drug dealers who deal out drugs in broad daylight in front of kids, with kids, and show blatant disrespect to anyone who shows they can handle their own against them. What they don't expect is the pastor that can take them down, especially when he reveals that he, too, has a past.There are a few people who hate this movie and say it's not a ""Christian"" movie, and the producers said they didn't want to label it as such. Why? Nothing about the language (compared to Hollywood, this is rather tame), but because it doesn't deal with conversions (like most Christians seem to expect) or an apocalyptic film (that seems cliched to do, but they do still do it), but because it deals with redemption with people from different backgrounds.For an independently made (and small-budgeted) film, this does pretty good compared to other indie flicks I've seen (and wish I hadn't), especially in the Christian realm. As such, the acting is good (especially with Jeff Carr's attitude), the camera style subliminal in its presentation, the humor (though somewhat sparse) is refreshing when it's needed. The poignancy shows real-life grit without delving into R-rated junk (always appreciated). It's too bad there are Christians who miss the needed message for what they perceive as an ""unChristian"" ""Hollywood"" flick.This movie is primarily about getting a second chance in life when everyone around you won't bother giving you one.Hopefully there will be more movies with Jeff Carr in it if he can keep acting so brilliantly.",5,Struggles Within and Without,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",2013,2187,"['things', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'entertainment-wise', 'are', 'people', 'extremely', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'getting', 'know', 'other', 'even', 'one', ""n't"", 'like', 'idea.And', 'what', 'when', 'white', 'pastor', 'due', 'laxed', 'personality', 'church', 'style', 'worship', 'challenged', 'ailing', 'father', 'hang', 'out', 'inner-city', 'pastor', 'who', 'edge', 'style', 'personality', 'tempered-down', 'wife', 'help', 'keep', 'cool', 'Pastor', 'Ethan', 'Second', 'Chance', 'Church', 'central', 'church', 'branch', ""n't"", 'easy', 'get', 'whatwith', 'clicheing', 'mind', 'how', 'Pastor', 'Jake', 'ruffians', 'neighborhood', 'ruffians', 'mean', 'drug', 'dealers', 'who', 'deal', 'out', 'drugs', 'broad', 'daylight', 'front', 'kids', 'kids', 'show', 'blatant', 'disrespect', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'handle', 'own', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'pastor', 'can', 'take', 'down', 'especially', 'when', 'too', 'past.There', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'hate', 'movie', 'say', 'not', 'Christian', 'movie', 'producers', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'label', 'such', 'Why', 'Nothing', 'language', 'compared', 'Hollywood', 'rather', 'tame', ""n't"", 'deal', 'conversions', 'most', 'Christians', 'seem', 'expect', 'apocalyptic', 'film', 'cliched', 'do', 'do', 'still', 'do', 'redemption', 'people', 'different', 'backgrounds.For', 'independently', 'made', 'small-budgeted', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'compared', 'other', 'indie', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'especially', 'Christian', 'realm', 'such', 'acting', 'good', 'especially', 'Jeff', 'Carr', 'attitude', 'camera', 'style', 'subliminal', 'presentation', 'humor', 'somewhat', 'sparse', 'refreshing', 'when', 'needed', 'poignancy', 'real-life', 'grit', 'delving', 'R-rated', 'junk', 'always', 'appreciated', 'too', 'bad', 'are', 'Christians', 'who', 'miss', 'needed', 'message', 'what', 'perceive', 'unChristian', 'Hollywood', 'flick.This', 'movie', 'primarily', 'getting', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'when', 'everyone', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bother', 'giving', 'one.Hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'movies', 'Jeff', 'Carr', 'can', 'keep', 'acting', 'so', 'brilliantly']",The Second Chance

With Steve Taylor at the helm... I thought, ""Maybe. Just maybe...""Truthfully -- it exceeded all my expectations. Smartly written, smartly directed, and even well-acted... for the most part.(I shouldn't even label it as a good ""Christian"" movie. It's just a good movie. Period. I think a lot of people will enjoy this film.)Michale W. Smith does a pretty good job playing the talented music minister, Ethan Jenkins -- the son and successor-to-be of the successful Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, senior pastor of The Rock (Mega)Church and founding pastor of the inner city church, The Second Chance.Smith plays an interesting character.  While his own road to success may have been paved by that of his father, he wants to do the right thing and has a good heart. A bit naive, perhaps, in his view of life and ministry, he is greatly affected by what he sees and experiences at The Second Chance Church when he is sent there by a miffed church board as ""punishment"" for being a little to loose with the church's live television broadcasts.Jeff Carr is very charming and convincing as the passionate - ""in your face"" - and somewhat jaded-by-reality Pastor Jake Sanders. He believes strongly in the ministry of the Second Chance Church in his community -- but he's allowed his anger and his temper to cloud some of his decisions and judgment. (Sanders' tongue is actually what gets Ethan Jenkins in trouble when Jenkins gives him some air-time on the The Rock's live televised program -- ""Well, then... you can just keep your damn money!"")Jenkins and Sanders are then forced to work together. Sanders' inner-city method of ""ministry"" is sometimes more than wide-eyed, open-mouthed Jenkins can swallow... (When Sander slams a drug-pushing gang-member up against the fence and threatens to break his arm if the gangster doesn't let his little brother ""out"" of the family business... well, Jenkins hardly knows what to do with himself.)Both Jenkins and Sanders go through some pretty significant yet believable changes as they learn from each other -- perhaps Jenkins moreso from Sanders. And even Ethan's father, Pastor Jeremiah Jenkins, has to face the reality that even though his ministry at The Rock has gone global, he has forgotten where it all started... leading the movie's climax to a heartfelt and satisfying ""conclusion.""Pick it up.

As the leader of my church's drama ministry I believe we are responsible to pursue and promote excellence in the arts. Poor craftsmanship implies poor effort and lacks credibility. Trust me, the makers of this film feel the same way.When I saw this was a film by Steve Taylor, I knew I had to see this movie.When I heard Michael W. Smith was in the lead role, I wasn't so sure I wanted to see this movie.Well, I was pleased with much of it, challenged as a Christian by parts of it, and disappointed with lots of it. As with his cutting edge music, Taylor pushed some buttons that definitely needed to be pushed (punched and smashed, too) about the marketing mentality within the church, the social laziness we ignore, the racial ignorance we tolerate (on both sides), and the flawless facade we try to project. As for the occasional swearing the pastor does, that's just real life. Preachers are fallible.As for Smitty, all I can say is, ""He obviously worked very hard on this and there were times when he was very effective."" That's nicer than saying, ""Don't quit your day job."" And more honest, really. He truly didn't stink at it. But I doubt he'll ever be on Martin Scorsese's speed dial.jeff obafemi carr (the lowercase thing is his idea) is pretty darn good, though. Hope to see him again.The great, glaring weakness of 'Second Chance' is in the retreaded plots: Plot A: A small, faithful inner city church is financially strapped and the administrative board plans to shut it down if its fortunes don't turn around, so the congregation rallies to save it. Plot B: A rebellious, successful son is resistant about taking over the reins of a church from his kindly old father, the senior pastor who is beloved by everyone. Heard either of those plots before? Sure, in just about every story about a church that you've ever seen from 'The Preacher's Wife', 'Sister Act,' and 'The Gospel' to dozens of episodes of 'Highway to Heaven' and 'Touched by An Angel' to half of the Christian novels ever written. Is there no other story out there?I really feel Taylor missed an opportunity by not trying for a more original story to tell, one that the average person could identify with. And hadn't seen before.

Prostitutes needing help!) and hip (Michael W Smith sings!) but the underlying message is actually quite low key, as is the acting.Michael W Smith plays the son of a highly successful pastor, being groomed to take over a large affluent church, with its large international outreach program.  He helps the pastor of their sister church, called Second Chance, which is where his father started - it is in the slums, with outreaches to the poor and needy, the prostitutes and gang victims.  He is admonished for giving the pastor of the poor church a chance to speak his mind on live television, and as discipline, is sent to the Second Chance church for a time, to observe and report.  Naturally, in doing so, he starts to gain a realization of his distance from real life and genuine outreach, and becomes a better person..Some of the efforts at getting a message across are a bit clumsy - Michael Smith has his fancy BMW damaged and trades it in for a small cheap car and is happier as a result.  However, some of the underlying themes of where church politics can lead are prescient and worth raising.  Should affluent churches from wealthy neighbourhoods really invest so heavily in African outreach, when poverty and destitution are creating huge problems on their doorstep?In answering these questions, the movie comes across a little one sided and heavy handed, but the point is well made, if lacking punch in the finale.A worthy effort and well shot and acted.
