1043365,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B000M343CQ,barry,"[0, 0]","This film is an excellent independant film and is very underrated.  The story basically has Nick Nolte as Ray Cooke, a baseball umpire and Dave Tibbel as Morgan, a player on one of the teams.  When Ray gives a call in a game the players don't agree with a group of kids get together and trash his house.  Ray catches Morgan in the act and holds him responsible.  They come to an agreement that he will work off the cost of the damage that was done to Ray's car during the trashing.  They bond and Ray later asks Morgan to go with him to his High School reunion pretending to be his son so that he will make a good impression.There the plot is in a nutshell but the movie is about so much more than this.  The film is a very intelligent, highly effective character study.  The characters of Ray and Morgan are very complex and the process through which they bond is very realistic anvd very believable.  As their relationship develops they find in each other things they didn't even know they were lacking.  The high school reunion is merely a small part of the plot.  The story is really told through the relationship of Ray and Morgan.  Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance and shows he is still a force to be reckoned with.  This was definitely an Oscar worthy performance.  And Dave Tibbel gives a performance that is far beyond his years.The whole cast is exceptional but the movie rests on the shoulders of Nick Nolte and Dave Tibbel.  The way they play off of each other is superb and to watch two lonely people form a real, honest, emotional bond that is based on trust and true affection is expertly told here.  And to fully satisfy, the movie builds to a very realist conclusion and does not leave you hanging.This movie is emotional throughout and I highly recommend it.",5,Excellent Film,1222387200,"09 26, 2008",2008,1785,"['film', 'excellent', 'independant', 'film', 'very', 'underrated', 'story', 'basically', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Ray', 'Cooke', 'baseball', 'umpire', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'Morgan', 'player', 'one', 'teams', 'When', 'Ray', 'call', 'game', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'group', 'kids', 'get', 'together', 'trash', 'house', 'Ray', 'Morgan', 'act', 'responsible', 'come', 'agreement', 'will', 'work', 'off', 'cost', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'Ray', 'car', 'trashing', 'bond', 'Ray', 'later', 'Morgan', 'go', 'High', 'School', 'reunion', 'pretending', 'be', 'son', 'so', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'impression.There', 'plot', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'very', 'intelligent', 'highly', 'effective', 'character', 'study', 'characters', 'Ray', 'Morgan', 'are', 'very', 'complex', 'process', 'bond', 'very', 'realistic', 'anvd', 'very', 'believable', 'relationship', 'find', 'other', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', 'lacking', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'merely', 'small', 'part', 'plot', 'story', 'really', 'told', 'relationship', 'Ray', 'Morgan', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'excellent', 'performance', 'still', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'was', 'definitely', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'performance', 'far', 'years.The', 'whole', 'cast', 'exceptional', 'movie', 'shoulders', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'way', 'play', 'other', 'superb', 'watch', 'two', 'lonely', 'people', 'form', 'real', 'honest', 'emotional', 'bond', 'based', 'trust', 'true', 'affection', 'expertly', 'told', 'here', 'fully', 'satisfy', 'movie', 'very', 'realist', 'conclusion', 'not', 'leave', 'hanging.This', 'movie', 'emotional', 'highly', 'recommend']",Off the Black

The viewer can almost hear his bones creak with each movement.  His voice is like a rake over gravel with the volume turned down.

Especially if one has to deal with an absent parent or a psychologically dysfunctional one ...or both. And such is the case for Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan) who's mother left him and his kid sister with their severely depressed father played by a surprisingly effective Timothy Hutton. But much of this is slowly unveiled and OFF THE BLACK begins with an umpire making a pivotal call at a baseball game which ends up costing Dave Tibbel and his team their high school championship. The umpire is a gruff man named Ray Cook played by Nick Nolte (Over the Hedge (Widescreen Edition)).It is Nolte who carries the entire film, really. And it probably wasn't that much of a stretch for him to play the drunken Cook character considering Nolte's past notices on the local news. Which, of course, made him the perfect casting choice. His gravelly voice and fading good looks matched Ray Cook's persona to a tee. When Ray finds a bunch of team members toilet-papering his home, he's able to catch one of them and, of course, it's Dave Tibbel. They strike up an interesting relationship. Dave needs something more of a father figure (which he's not getting at home), while Ray needs to connect with someone from the outside world in a meaningful way.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The two bond in father/son fashion one night after Ray takes Dave to his 40 year class reunion posing as Ray's son. It is here that Dave learns much about this enigmatic patriarchal man. Ray has a real son that he sends video recordings of himself to, only to have most of them returned unopened. Ray leans on Dave as a crutch and Dave does likewise to Ray, each needing and receiving something from the other. And it isn't always a ""good"" something. But it is a needful something that leads both of them to an understanding of what lay ahead. For Ray, it's not a good thing, as he recently received some bad news from his doctor. For Dave, we just aren't sure because his home-life seems totally dysfunctional.Nolte's performance is outstanding, but it is his performance (and only his performance) that pulls the story along in any satisfying way. Trevor Morgan tries his damnedest to match Nolte but can't quite muster enough of himself to make his Dave character very sympathetic. Timothy Hutton did a fine job as the depressed father but has so little screen time that you never get a good sense of him. Dave's sister Ashley played by Sonia Feigelson is another example of a character that could've pulled in some emotional weight but was never given enough time on-screen.So the entire production felt a bit stilted, hedging all of its bets on Nolte's shoulder ...which was probably for the best considering the overall story/script.",3,It's All Nolte And Little Else,1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,2752,"['Family', 'family', 'sometimes', 'unfortunate', 'Especially', 'one', 'deal', 'absent', 'parent', 'psychologically', 'dysfunctional', 'one', 'such', 'case', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'who', 'mother', 'left', 'kid', 'sister', 'severely', 'depressed', 'father', 'played', 'surprisingly', 'effective', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'much', 'slowly', 'unveiled', 'THE', 'BLACK', 'umpire', 'making', 'pivotal', 'call', 'baseball', 'game', 'up', 'costing', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'team', 'high', 'school', 'championship', 'umpire', 'gruff', 'man', 'named', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'played', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Hedge', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '.It', 'Nolte', 'who', 'entire', 'film', 'really', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'stretch', 'play', 'drunken', 'Cook', 'character', 'considering', 'Nolte', 'past', 'notices', 'local', 'news', 'Which', 'course', 'made', 'perfect', 'casting', 'choice', 'gravelly', 'voice', 'fading', 'good', 'looks', 'matched', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'persona', 'tee', 'When', 'Ray', 'bunch', 'team', 'members', 'toilet-papering', 'home', 'able', 'catch', 'one', 'course', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'strike', 'up', 'interesting', 'relationship', 'Dave', 'something', 'more', 'father', 'figure', 'not', 'getting', 'home', 'Ray', 'connect', 'someone', 'outside', 'world', 'meaningful', 'way', '***SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***The', 'two', 'bond', 'father/son', 'fashion', 'one', 'night', 'Ray', 'Dave', '40', 'year', 'class', 'reunion', 'posing', 'Ray', 'son', 'here', 'Dave', 'much', 'enigmatic', 'patriarchal', 'man', 'Ray', 'real', 'son', 'video', 'recordings', 'only', 'have', 'most', 'returned', 'unopened', 'Ray', 'Dave', 'crutch', 'Dave', 'likewise', 'Ray', 'needing', 'receiving', 'something', 'other', ""n't"", 'always', 'good', 'something', 'needful', 'something', 'understanding', 'what', 'lay', 'ahead', 'Ray', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'recently', 'received', 'bad', 'news', 'doctor', 'Dave', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'home-life', 'totally', 'dysfunctional.Nolte', 'performance', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'only', 'performance', 'story', 'satisfying', 'way', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'damnedest', 'match', 'Nolte', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'muster', 'enough', 'make', 'Dave', 'character', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'depressed', 'father', 'so', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'never', 'get', 'good', 'sense', 'Dave', 'sister', 'Ashley', 'played', 'Sonia', 'Feigelson', 'example', 'character', 'could', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'emotional', 'weight', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'enough', 'time', 'on-screen.So', 'entire', 'production', 'felt', 'bit', 'stilted', 'hedging', 'bets', 'Nolte', 'shoulder', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'considering', 'overall', 'story/script']",Off the Black
1043368,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B000M343CQ,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 0]","Let's get something straight. I rented ""Off the Black"" because of Nick Nolte. No other reason. This beautiful and touching 2006 film was a fine surprise. As usual, Nolte delivers another in a long line of brilliant characters.Our greatest living American actor, Nolte has truly never given a bad performance. Even during his most commercial ventures, when he's all but sleepwalking, he steals the show. In many ways, I believe Nolte is bored with acting (most of the great ones eventually are), so it's a testament to his legend that he continues to challenge himself with thought-provoking and interesting independent films. He's not looking to make big bucks and he could care less about his legacy.""Off the Black"" (a baseball term) is a wonderful slice of life detailing small town loner Ray Cook (Nolte) who works at the auto junkyard while serving as a baseball umpire at high school games. At night, usually after being booed off the field by angry fans, he passes out in front of his TV after downing a few beers, mumbling to himself in all but unintelligible dialog.Every town and city has someone like Ray Cook. These lonely souls, usually widowed, barely function on a day-to-day basis as life dwindles to a quiet close. We see these guys working at the grocery store or gas station and often times wonder what their lives were like before decline and disillousionment. They seem to have memories of better times and places, wondering how everything went to hell. Nolte's Ray Cook is one of these men, living, breathing, limping from the hard knocks of life with a voice that sounds like alley gravel. He catches Dave Tibbel, one of the local baseball-playing youths, vandalizing his yard and cuts a a deal with him to clean up the mess.Tibbel (in an excellent performance by Trevor Morgan) has an AWOL mom, a hapless dad sleeping off hungover depressions and a younger sister he cares for. Thus begins an unlikely friendship between two lost souls, a hermit pushing 60 and a confused kid with a miserable homelife. Through it all, promising writer and director James Ponsoldt displays an interesting visual eye contrasted with thoughtful restraint. Much of the story is insinuated, though I would have enjoyed a bit more explanation. I love the nameless locale, a small industrial town that has seen better days. Filmed in New York state, ""Off the Black"" could have just as easily taken place in Michigan or Ohio.Early on, Nolte's character is diagnosed with a fatal disease, so there's a sense of urgency to his budding friendship with Tibbel. His 40th high school reunion is coming up, so he asks Tibbel to accompany him in the guise of his son. It's all very touching and subtle, and we learn much about Cook's sad past.Several interesting supporting characters are introduced, including Tibbel's dad, a nice turn by Timothy Hutton, and a local 20-something single mom played by the lovely Rosemarie DeWitt. Neither character is properly fleshed out and I would have liked to see more of their lives. No matter. By the conclusion, we have been introduced to a sad but wonderful world in ""Off the Black."" These are tender, believable characters and we do not wish the film to end. In Ponsoldt's ""Off the Black,"" nameless and forgotten men like Cox are given a brief moment to provide influence and, in the end, perhaps help someone avoid a similar fate.This is not only one of the best films of 2006, but it is one of Nolte's greatest performances.",4,A sad but wonderful world,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",2008,3461,"['Let', 'get', 'something', 'straight', 'rented', 'Black', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'other', 'reason', 'beautiful', 'touching', '2006', 'film', 'was', 'fine', 'surprise', 'usual', 'Nolte', 'long', 'line', 'brilliant', 'characters.Our', 'greatest', 'living', 'American', 'actor', 'Nolte', 'truly', 'never', 'given', 'bad', 'performance', 'Even', 'most', 'commercial', 'ventures', 'when', 'sleepwalking', 'show', 'many', 'ways', 'believe', 'Nolte', 'bored', 'acting', 'most', 'great', 'ones', 'eventually', 'are', 'testament', 'legend', 'challenge', 'thought-provoking', 'interesting', 'independent', 'films', 'not', 'looking', 'make', 'big', 'bucks', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'legacy', 'Black', 'baseball', 'term', 'wonderful', 'slice', 'life', 'detailing', 'small', 'town', 'loner', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'Nolte', 'who', 'auto', 'junkyard', 'serving', 'baseball', 'umpire', 'high', 'school', 'games', 'night', 'usually', 'being', 'booed', 'off', 'field', 'angry', 'fans', 'out', 'front', 'TV', 'downing', 'few', 'beers', 'mumbling', 'unintelligible', 'dialog.Every', 'town', 'city', 'someone', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'lonely', 'souls', 'usually', 'widowed', 'barely', 'function', 'day-to-day', 'basis', 'life', 'dwindles', 'quiet', 'close', 'see', 'guys', 'working', 'grocery', 'store', 'gas', 'station', 'often', 'times', 'wonder', 'what', 'lives', 'were', 'decline', 'disillousionment', 'seem', 'have', 'memories', 'better', 'times', 'places', 'wondering', 'how', 'everything', 'went', 'hell', 'Nolte', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'one', 'men', 'living', 'breathing', 'limping', 'hard', 'knocks', 'life', 'voice', 'alley', 'gravel', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'one', 'local', 'baseball-playing', 'youths', 'vandalizing', 'yard', 'deal', 'clean', 'up', 'mess.Tibbel', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'AWOL', 'mom', 'hapless', 'dad', 'sleeping', 'off', 'hungover', 'depressions', 'younger', 'sister', 'Thus', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'hermit', 'pushing', '60', 'confused', 'kid', 'miserable', 'homelife', 'promising', 'writer', 'director', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'interesting', 'visual', 'eye', 'contrasted', 'thoughtful', 'restraint', 'Much', 'story', 'insinuated', 'would', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'more', 'explanation', 'love', 'nameless', 'locale', 'small', 'industrial', 'town', 'seen', 'better', 'days', 'Filmed', 'New', 'York', 'state', 'Black', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'easily', 'taken', 'place', 'Michigan', 'Ohio.Early', 'Nolte', 'character', 'diagnosed', 'fatal', 'disease', 'sense', 'urgency', 'budding', 'friendship', 'Tibbel', '40th', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'coming', 'up', 'Tibbel', 'accompany', 'guise', 'son', 'very', 'touching', 'subtle', 'learn', 'much', 'Cook', 'sad', 'past.Several', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'including', 'Tibbel', 'dad', 'nice', 'turn', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'local', '20-something', 'single', 'mom', 'played', 'lovely', 'Rosemarie', 'DeWitt', 'character', 'properly', 'fleshed', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'more', 'lives', 'matter', 'conclusion', 'have', 'been', 'introduced', 'sad', 'wonderful', 'world', 'Black', 'are', 'tender', 'believable', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'wish', 'film', 'end', 'Ponsoldt', 'Black', 'nameless', 'forgotten', 'men', 'Cox', 'are', 'given', 'brief', 'moment', 'provide', 'influence', 'end', 'perhaps', 'help', 'someone', 'avoid', 'similar', 'fate.This', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2006', 'one', 'Nolte', 'greatest', 'performances']",Off the Black

1043371,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000M343CQ,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","James Ponsoldt is an impressive new talent whose gifts are well displayed in this very excellent small film, OFF THE BLACK.  Ponsoldt is that rare combination of writer/director who has something unusual and significant to say and has the skills to tell his story with genuine sensitivity and with amazingly polished skill for one so new on the scene.In a small town anywhere in the US aging alcoholic Ray Cook (Nick Nolte) lives alone, spends his time making videotapes of himself in conversation with his son from whom he has been separated for years. He also is the umpire for the local baseball team, the pitcher for whom is a teenage lad Dave Tibbel (Trevor Morgan), a boy whose mother deserted her family leaving Dave and his younger sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson) in the care of functionless distant father (Timothy Hutton),  a man who would rather avoid any conversation or emotional support with his confused kids.  Dave and two friends visit Ray Cook's house one night, empty trash on his lawn, scratch graffiti on his driveway and throw toilet paper streaming from the tree and TV antennae.  Ray is sober enough to catch one of them - Dave - and makes a pact with the boy that he will not call the cops if Dave promises to clean up Ray's cluttered yard.Dave keeps his promise and gradually Ray and Dave warm to each other, each finding in the other the desperate needs to fill their empty lives - a 'son' and a 'father'.  Ray convinces Dave to pose as his son at his high school reunion and the results of that experience coupled with numerous other incidents bond the two in one of the more tender love relationships ever captured on film.  No, this film is not about physical attraction: it is about the kind of love that is a basic need in each of us and one that sadly is lacking in so very many lives today.Nick Nolte delivers a superb performance and it is refreshing to see him once again prove that he is a fine character actor.  Trevor Morgan (at age 20!) is a revelation, that kind of actor who apparently excels in his craft intuitively.  The supporting cast is likewise first class and the musical  score by Claire Campbell, Alex Neville, and Brian Petway fits the film like a glove.  Tim Orr's cinematography is so attuned to the story that it feels like the camera is another character.  OFF THE BLACK is yet another little Indie film that came in under the radar and deserves so much greater an audience than it has had.  Highly Recommended.

But this is not ""Brokeback Baseball,"" no, although surely that may enter your mind. It's something else. It's something rarely explored in American cinema, and it's bold and daring. It's a love story -- a good old-fashioned romance between two individuals who just happen to be male, and it's totally platonic. ""Is this possible?"" you may ask. It sure is, and ""Off the Black"" will prove it to you.This film is made with passion and care. The soft, natural lighting of the interiors allows the full mystery of the characters to flourish. Single point lighting allows interplay of light and shadow which echoes the bright and dark sides of Dave and Ray, as well as the family members who surround them. Dave's father Tom (Timothy Hutton), withdrawn and distant. Sister Ashley (Sonia Feigelson), on the cusp of adulthood, gawky and afraid. All have secrets to tell, but don't, or won't, or can't. Cinematographer Tim Orr manages to find beauty in every little thing -- contrails, dripping gutters, siding and eaves and gently sloping roofs. And the countryside -- oh my. The lush scenery of the Catskills is indescribable. The setting is supposed to be Ponsoldt's Georgia home. But it could be anywhere where sea and sky and small towns predominate. Some of the shots are literally breathtaking. I found myself gasping several times. But what tugged at my heart even more was the sparse, almost homespun soundtrack. Punctuated by the occasional train whistle in the distance, the music never distracted, never shouted, ""this is important."" The contrast between the beauty of the setting and the ugliness of the fractured individuals who populate it is stark. It is on this canvas that writer-director James Ponsoldt, in his first feature, crafts a work of art that is simply one of the most poignant love stories imaginable. The protagonists meet, get tangled in tension and deception, and finally fall in love. Occasionally that's followed by breakup and tragedy. Ponsoldt has said that he actually wrote the film as a romantic love story. It just happened to be played by two male actors and is platonic.To be honest, the film can be hard to watch at times. Nolte's portrayal of the seldom sober Ray is unsettling and painful, like a bad toothache that you can't wait to be pulled. Morgan's sensitive, vulnerable, sad-eyed Dave is like a puppy cowering beneath Ray's rolled up newspaper. But the bravado falls away on Ray's part, the sarcastic self-confidence and humor emerges from Dave, and the boy who needs a father draws closer to the man who needs a son. Finally, what makes this film so joyful to watch is the interplay between the two. It is all so natural that it seemed unscripted. As it turned out, much of it was. Ponsoldt has admitted that he gave free reign to Nolte and Morgan quite often, and some of the best lines in the film were theirs and theirs alone. And only the best directors are willing to step back and let that happen. And only the best actors can pull it off. Most will not be surprised at Nolte's performance -- he is, after all, a veteran if there ever was one. But ""Off the Black"" could be the vehicle which puts Trevor Morgan on filmgoers' radar, if it's not already. I'd seen his work before (he was Ponsoldt's first choice, largely based on his performance in the indie classic ""Mean Creek""), but he carries this film so confidently and easily that it left me shaking my head in wonderment. And with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. ""Off the Black"" will do that to you.",5,Classic romantic love story with a twist,1176768000,"04 17, 2007",2007,4266,"['experience', 'seeing', 'Black', 'did', 'what', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'done', 'lately', 'left', 'tear', 'eye', 'smile', 'face.Within', 'seconds', 'literally', 'are', 'introduced', 'young', 'Dave', 'Tibbel', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'standing', 'pitcher', 'mound', 'sweat', 'beaded', 'brow', 'studying', 'catcher', 'signals', 'face', 'completely', 'screen', 'director', 'saying', 'here', 'go', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'what', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'tough', 'do', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'story', 'develop', 'story', 'relationship', 'Dave', 'someone', 'else', 'course', 'someone', 'blonde', 'bombshell', 'voluptuous', 'vixen', 'other', 'half', 'relationship', 'Ray', 'Cook', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'ump', 'standing', 'home', 'plate', 'not', 'Brokeback', 'Baseball', 'surely', 'may', 'enter', 'mind', 'something', 'else', 'something', 'rarely', 'explored', 'American', 'cinema', 'bold', 'daring', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'romance', 'two', 'individuals', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'male', 'totally', 'platonic', 'possible', 'may', 'ask', 'sure', 'Black', 'will', 'prove', 'you.This', 'film', 'made', 'passion', 'care', 'soft', 'natural', 'lighting', 'interiors', 'full', 'mystery', 'characters', 'flourish', 'Single', 'point', 'lighting', 'allows', 'interplay', 'light', 'shadow', 'bright', 'dark', 'sides', 'Dave', 'Ray', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'surround', 'Dave', 'father', 'Tom', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'withdrawn', 'distant', 'Sister', 'Ashley', 'Sonia', 'Feigelson', 'cusp', 'adulthood', 'gawky', 'afraid', 'have', 'secrets', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'Cinematographer', 'Tim', 'Orr', 'find', 'beauty', 'little', 'thing', 'contrails', 'dripping', 'gutters', 'siding', 'eaves', 'gently', 'sloping', 'roofs', 'countryside', 'oh', 'lush', 'scenery', 'Catskills', 'indescribable', 'setting', 'supposed', 'be', 'Ponsoldt', 'Georgia', 'home', 'could', 'be', 'anywhere', 'where', 'sea', 'sky', 'small', 'towns', 'predominate', 'shots', 'are', 'literally', 'breathtaking', 'found', 'gasping', 'several', 'times', 'what', 'tugged', 'heart', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'sparse', 'almost', 'homespun', 'soundtrack', 'Punctuated', 'occasional', 'train', 'whistle', 'distance', 'music', 'never', 'distracted', 'never', 'shouted', 'important', 'contrast', 'beauty', 'setting', 'ugliness', 'fractured', 'individuals', 'who', 'populate', 'stark', 'canvas', 'writer-director', 'James', 'Ponsoldt', 'first', 'feature', 'crafts', 'work', 'art', 'simply', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'love', 'stories', 'imaginable', 'protagonists', 'meet', 'get', 'tangled', 'tension', 'deception', 'finally', 'fall', 'love', 'Occasionally', 'followed', 'breakup', 'tragedy', 'Ponsoldt', 'said', 'actually', 'wrote', 'film', 'romantic', 'love', 'story', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'played', 'two', 'male', 'actors', 'platonic.To', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'Nolte', 'portrayal', 'seldom', 'sober', 'Ray', 'unsettling', 'painful', 'bad', 'toothache', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'be', 'pulled', 'Morgan', 'sensitive', 'vulnerable', 'sad-eyed', 'Dave', 'puppy', 'cowering', 'beneath', 'Ray', 'rolled', 'up', 'newspaper', 'bravado', 'away', 'Ray', 'part', 'sarcastic', 'self-confidence', 'humor', 'emerges', 'Dave', 'boy', 'who', 'father', 'closer', 'man', 'who', 'son', 'Finally', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'joyful', 'watch', 'interplay', 'two', 'so', 'natural', 'seemed', 'unscripted', 'turned', 'out', 'much', 'was', 'Ponsoldt', 'admitted', 'gave', 'free', 'reign', 'Nolte', 'Morgan', 'quite', 'often', 'best', 'lines', 'film', 'were', 'theirs', 'theirs', 'alone', 'only', 'best', 'directors', 'are', 'willing', 'step', 'back', 'let', 'happen', 'only', 'best', 'actors', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'Most', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'surprised', 'Nolte', 'performance', 'veteran', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Black', 'could', 'be', 'vehicle', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'filmgoers', 'radar', 'not', 'already', ""'d"", 'seen', 'work', 'before', 'was', 'Ponsoldt', 'first', 'choice', 'largely', 'based', 'performance', 'indie', 'classic', 'Mean', 'Creek', 'film', 'so', 'confidently', 'easily', 'left', 'shaking', 'head', 'wonderment', 'tear', 'eye', 'smile', 'face', 'Black', 'will', 'do']",Off the Black
1043375,A129YBX5BVNW2,B000M343CQ,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 1]","A couple of shades short of a masterpiece, ""Off The Black"" is still a superlative and very assured debut from a new director - James Ponsoldt.Nick Nolte plays an old-school Baseball Umpire called Ray Cook - a 57-year old drunk by night barely holding it together on the field by day. At the very beginning of the movie, Ray makes what most of the town considers is a 'bad call' on the pitch of a minor Leagues game. The recipient of this gaff is a young baseball hopeful called Dave Tibbel (played by Trevor Morgan - he looks like the son of Sean Penn and Elizabeth Hurley) and it changes both of their lives forever.In revenge for the sending off, Morgan and two of his mouthy team-mates shower Nolte's home that night with toilet rolls, spray paint his driveway with a dick drawing, break his car window and generally vandalize his property. But the young and inexperienced Morgan gets caught in the act by a boozed-up Nolte who vows that Morgan will have to pay for his actions - in short - clean up the mess. Morgan's character David - being essentially a nice kid - agrees - and over the next few days, they enter into an unexpected and unlikely bond - David slowly becoming the son that loser Nolte never had.While this is going on, David's real father, Timothy Hutton, offers little help to either him or his lost little sister at home. David's sister is played by Sally Kirkland - who looks like a young Natalie Portman - just as beautiful and an actress that's definitely one to watch. Hutton's character is a man who's lost his wife two years back for inexplicable reasons (possibly mental illness, maybe drink) and seems to have mentally checked-out ever since. He offers his kids mumbles at the breakfast table, distant platitudes that have no teeth. He seems more lost in his own way than Nolte's character is - and gives the two kids worry instead of real guidance when they need it the most. Both the young Morgan and Kirkland are fantastic in these scenes - displaying a confidence and calm in the presence of such big hitters as Nolte and Hutton.Nolte gets a diagnosis from his doctor that is unsurprising given that he has a cold tin in his hand for most of the movie. There isn't much time left. Nolte then gets his annual high-school reunion of '66 invitation in the post, which he would normally bin, but not this year. He persuades young David to accompany him to the reunion - pretending to be his son - the boy agrees. And on the story goes.""Off The Black"" is a Baseball term - it's the Umpire's call - and his call sends the Pitcher who threw the ball either into the ecstasy of winning or the misery of losing for his whole team. It's a film that has little real story but says a lot - and contains scene-stealing performances from the whole cast (most of whom are young) but especially from the gruff and growly Nolte - who could just stand there and you'd still love him...I liked it a lot - ""Off The Black"" has heart and is well worth checking out.

Fine cast includes Nick Nolte as a coach, Timothy Hutton as a father and newcomer Trevor Morgan who is the latest version of young Sean Penn.  Thru a set of circumstances, Dave establishes a friendship with the coach that leads them both to a pact where Dave will accompany Ray on his 40th high school reunion party.  Dave's role at the party is to pretend to be Ray's son.  The experience is life changing for both of them, but Ray is too old, too sick, too lonely to carry on in this world.  As we watch the story unfolds, we connect with the beauty of growing up, no matter how painful it may be.  This is beautiful movie for entire family.

1043378,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000M343CQ,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[0, 3]","This movie deserves praise first of all for its markedly beautiful photography and for the acting in the two principal parts. The rural vistas are stunning, and the film's stars, Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan, are actors who would be wonderful, I suspect, just reading the phonebook aloud. But the excellence stops pretty sharply at this juncture. The key problem is the derivative, facile, paint-by-numbers screenplay, which, first of all, is a rip-off of Jonathan Demme's superior ""Something Wild.""  In its present incarnation, the person who needs a stand-in at his high school reunion, for reasons intially ""hidden,"" is a man, the Nolte character. His film-long, mostly psychological hold over the Trevor Morgan character, a teenager he coerces into attending the reunion posing as his son, is questionable at best, more the easy conceit of a film-school author's mind than anything grounded in real human experience. The surmise that something sexual must be involved in male bonding is raised in the film and rightly dismissed, though even such a vulgar concept, had it in fact appeared here, might have helped turn what is a too tame, overtly contrived screenplay (think ""Lifetime Channel"") into a more gripping, believable film.John Keats said ""we hate art which has a palpable design upon us,"" and this stale, surfacy, highly formulaic work is a signal illustration of such a judgment. Its theme, a defense of the platitude that ""people need people"" is not presented in original enough a fashion to convert the platitude into a fresh-feeling, hard-won truth. Instead, it's finally just too pat and preachy for its own good. Its novice director, skillful with  actors, might do well to have a more talented screenwriter pen his future scripts.",3,Get  Real!,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,1750,"['movie', 'praise', 'first', 'markedly', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'acting', 'two', 'principal', 'parts', 'rural', 'vistas', 'are', 'stunning', 'film', 'stars', 'Nick', 'Nolte', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'suspect', 'just', 'reading', 'phonebook', 'aloud', 'excellence', 'pretty', 'sharply', 'juncture', 'key', 'problem', 'derivative', 'facile', 'paint-by-numbers', 'screenplay', 'first', 'rip-off', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'superior', 'Something', 'Wild', 'present', 'incarnation', 'person', 'who', 'stand-in', 'high', 'school', 'reunion', 'reasons', 'intially', 'hidden', 'man', 'Nolte', 'character', 'film-long', 'mostly', 'psychological', 'hold', 'Trevor', 'Morgan', 'character', 'teenager', 'attending', 'reunion', 'posing', 'son', 'questionable', 'best', 'more', 'easy', 'conceit', 'film-school', 'author', 'mind', 'anything', 'grounded', 'real', 'human', 'experience', 'surmise', 'something', 'sexual', 'must', 'be', 'involved', 'male', 'bonding', 'raised', 'film', 'rightly', 'dismissed', 'though', 'even', 'vulgar', 'concept', 'had', 'fact', 'appeared', 'here', 'might', 'have', 'helped', 'turn', 'what', 'too', 'tame', 'overtly', 'contrived', 'screenplay', 'think', 'Lifetime', 'Channel', 'more', 'gripping', 'believable', 'film.John', 'Keats', 'said', 'hate', 'art', 'palpable', 'design', 'stale', 'surfacy', 'highly', 'formulaic', 'work', 'signal', 'illustration', 'such', 'judgment', 'theme', 'defense', 'platitude', 'people', 'need', 'people', 'not', 'presented', 'original', 'enough', 'fashion', 'convert', 'platitude', 'fresh-feeling', 'hard-won', 'truth', 'Instead', 'finally', 'just', 'too', 'pat', 'preachy', 'own', 'good', 'novice', 'director', 'skillful', 'actors', 'might', 'do', 'well', 'have', 'more', 'talented', 'screenwriter', 'pen', 'future', 'scripts']",Off the Black
