However the cast is the main reason I like it and the story of course. This season deals with the club going to Ireland. I wont' spoil it by getting into detail. I was a bit tickled by the way the Harley's looked in Ireland. The Samcro guys had to wear actual helmets instead of the beanies you see lots of folks riding with in the States. I guess the Irish take more interest in head injuries than Americans do.The story has it's usual amounts of surprises in it which makes it irresistable to me. June Stahl the underhanded, ATF agent gets what's coming to her towards the end in a sort of surprise at least to me. Opie and Jacks are teamed up again as in previous episodes, Kickin ass and takin names.This season three of the Sons, is great, bet your life on it. It's way different in most aspects but great none-the-less. Ireland has some terrific scenery to see and some new people to meet, some good and beautiful, some no damn good.The club gets a readjustment in their ideas about the Irish. Some good and lots bad.If you believe in Karma then you'll love this season, it's full of it. I've found most people either love or have no opinion of Sons. Usually the ones that have no opinion are the people I don't know. Most of my friends love it. Maybe that's because lots of us ride Harleys?  Nah, it just a damn good show, period, believe it.

It is undoubtedly addictive, considering I watched the first three seasons over the course of about 4 days.  This is definitely a better than average drama television show.  The acting is mostly excellent, the writing is above average, I love how they have brought over THIRTEEN amazing Deadwood actors to the show, and like I said - it's addicting; twists and turns everywhere.  It's almost the only modern show I can think of that revolves around a motorcycle club.This season is mainly focused on the majority of the crew heading to Ireland to try to find Jax Teller's son, Abel, who was kidnapped in the Season 2 finale.  There is a LOT of time spent in Ireland, and they even have an ""Irish twist"" to the SoA theme song for awhile.  I was also impressed by the Agent June Stahl storyline this season, played by the amazing Ally Walker.  It gained a lot of momentum, was very original and clever, and caught my attention.Are you looking for the next Sopranos, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, or The Wire?  I'll be honest; don't look here.  This is a better than average drama, but it's by no means a ""prestigious"" show.  The main problem with this show is that they rely too much on cheap tricks, unnecessary drama, and unrealistic twists to keep the story rolling.  I love action-packed shows, but at times SoA can be extremely melodramatic, and instead of using good writing to keep the show fresh, they have to constantly make dramatic ""twists and turns.""  To me, it's a sign of poor and/or lazy writing.  There is too much kidnapping, too many silly romance angles, and even worse - a wimpy take on what the motorcycle gang life is really like.The show started strong without the moral compass that it has come to grown.  The characters were unforgivably who they are, and things were brutal.  However, over time the writers have ""softened"" the characters to make them more likable.  I loathe it when writers start to let their morals leak into their writing and characters, instead of letting them be what they should be; grey characters.  Honestly, these guys are WAY too nice to a M.C.  And that's just the truth, and Kurt Sutter has said it himself.As terrible as this may sound, this show kind of reminds me of Desperate Housewives masked with a motorcycle gang, violence, and rock music.  It's a true-blooded soap opera, through and through.  At times it is down-right mushy.  I have to admit my disappointment, because this show had the potential to be something truly amazing.  However, it just lacks the guts or writing talent to really make it happen.  Kurt Sutter has said himself that it's very over-the-top, but that it's supposed to be that way.  Truth or excuse?  It's not always just a little ""over-the-top,"" sometimes it is just downright silly.  I hoped with the research that Sutter did, he would have come up with something a little more morally ambiguous, a little less ""soapy,"" and definitely more realistic.Like I said, this is a better than average show and easy to get hooked on (hence my 4 star review).  However, it is definitely filled with lots of plot holes, disjointed storylines, and cliches, and isn't a top echelon show.  I am just suggesting to keep that in mind before starting.  Very exciting and action-packed though, and plenty of drama.

But I took the hook and bait and got reeled in pretty quickly finishing 2 seasons in one weekend and now finishing up the last few episodes of season 3.  So far, the show has gotten better with each season in the story arc and character development.  I feel I can relate to these antiheros during their ups and downs and I think that's what I find most intriguing about this show especially Tara's and Gemma's relationship and their own personal growth.  For those who say this is unbelievable I can say that the general premise is possible having worked in a small town with a well know history of corruption plaguing the local government, police force and a real-life FBI bust on a multi-million dollar drug operation back in the 80s in NC.  And motorcycle gangs are a real thing, like the well-know Hells Angels.  In fact, the creator of the show regularly consults with a prior affiliate.  Of course, this is entertainment so as to what is being exaggerated in the situations dealt with on the show seem far fetched for that exact purpose.  Go watch a documentary if you want 100% realism.  This show, while not as compelling as those on AMC like Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead in my opinion is still a wonderfully written show.  The only aspect I find annoying at times is when the MC brazenly runs deals out in broad daylight in public places in their monogrammed biker gear.

The message boards on sites like IMDB, and other fan driven sites were rife  with nay Sayers, people of short sight, and little faith in the strength of this show. Even die hard fans found ourselves questioning the story, wondering how Kurt Sutter was going to pull this off and not lose the integrity that makes this show work.With each episode Sutter and his wonderful cast built the tension, laid the ground work, layering the textures slowly.

1352425,A2WNWQT4OIPNBK,B003L77GK6,Kelly Hanna,"[7, 10]","As long as you can suspend your disbelief, this isnt a bad show.It has a couple issues that left me scratching my head though.At one point, during a clandestine 'sting' operation where the good guys are dropping off a backpack full of cash for the bad guy to pick up, some kids on bicycles grab the backpack and take off.  The nearby undercover agent actually yells 'Undercover agent' at the fleeing kids, trying to get them to stop.  You're on a plainclothes assignment that hinges on secrecy in the middle of a park and you yell at the top of your lungs that you're an undercover agent, not kowing if the bad guy is there or not.  Something that incredibly moronic really should have been caught and edited out or reshot.The relationship between the main character and his doctor girlfriend is also something else.  She appears to be a pediatric surgeon who was top of her class, completed her residency, etc.  Her thug excon motorcycle boyfriend is always broke, the motorcycle club is constantly broke and scrounging for cash.  One of the members is six months behind on his alimony and two months behind on his child support.  Whats the point of being a gun running, motorcycle riding, criminal if it doesnt at least pay well.  Their being broke seems to be a recurring theme.If your girlfriend is a pediatric surgeon (average salary in the US $355,000), its time to hang up your helmet and become a stay at home dad.  Sit on the couch and eat bon bons.  Pet your pomeranian.  Whatever.  Especially when your criminal enterprises result in your going to jail and getting stabbed and then still being broke.  The entire relationship is really laughable, as it relies on you believing that she is bright enough to accomplish the aforementioned, yet unbelievably stupid enough to want to be an 'old lady', even when her boyfriend goes off, fooling around with porn stars.  Even when one of the other wives gets shot in the back of the head by one of the gang members.  Even when the main characters mother is caught and destined to go to prison.  Even when another club members wife is beaten to death and left in a ditch by the side of the road.  Oh yes, and the gang rape of the main characters mother.  'Old lady' does not seem to be a career choice with a lot of upside to it.Speaking of jail, there is one poor sob, who is in the motorcycle gang and is currently in jail, gets his one good eye poked out, gets his wife killed, he gets put on death row, all due to being in this motorcycle gang.  I cant help but think that maybe his continuing devotion to the gang is misplaced, as it really doesnt seem to be going all that well for him.  Nonetheless the gang seems to constantly be asking him for favors and to gather intel, etc.  He lost is one good eye, his wife, his freedom, and in the near future, his life, all for this gang.  At some point I think you'd just have to tell your buddies to go pound sand, you've done enough.  Especially since, even if he did get out, he could never ride a motorcycle again (he only has 10% vision left) and the club has some sort of rule to the effect that if you cant ride, you cant be a member.These are the drawbacks, or at least the inconsistences as I saw them.  Not too terrible, but a bit silly and unbelievable.On the other hand, the action scenes are pretty good.  There are also some pretty humorous scenes.  I wont delve into detail on those, other than to say that some of the laughs make the unbelievable bits pale a bit.Overall, its fun to watch as long as you dont watch it with a critical mindset.",3,"Not a bad show, some flaws",1333843200,"04 8, 2012",2012,3561,"['As', 'long', 'can', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'bad', 'show.It', 'couple', 'issues', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'though.At', 'one', 'point', 'clandestine', ""'sting"", 'operation', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'dropping', 'off', 'backpack', 'full', 'cash', 'bad', 'guy', 'pick', 'up', 'kids', 'bicycles', 'grab', 'backpack', 'take', 'off', 'nearby', 'undercover', 'agent', 'actually', ""'Undercover"", 'agent', 'fleeing', 'kids', 'trying', 'get', 'stop', ""'re"", 'plainclothes', 'assignment', 'secrecy', 'middle', 'park', 'yell', 'top', 'lungs', ""'re"", 'undercover', 'agent', 'not', 'kowing', 'bad', 'guy', 'there', 'not', 'Something', 'incredibly', 'moronic', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'edited', 'out', 'reshot.The', 'relationship', 'main', 'character', 'doctor', 'girlfriend', 'also', 'something', 'else', 'be', 'pediatric', 'surgeon', 'who', 'was', 'top', 'class', 'completed', 'residency', 'etc', 'thug', 'excon', 'motorcycle', 'boyfriend', 'always', 'broke', 'motorcycle', 'club', 'constantly', 'broke', 'scrounging', 'cash', 'One', 'members', 'six', 'months', 'alimony', 'two', 'months', 'child', 'support', 'point', 'being', 'gun', 'running', 'motorcycle', 'riding', 'criminal', 'least', 'pay', 'well', 'being', 'broke', 'be', 'recurring', 'theme.If', 'girlfriend', 'pediatric', 'surgeon', 'average', 'salary', 'US', '355,000', 'time', 'hang', 'up', 'helmet', 'become', 'stay', 'home', 'dad', 'Sit', 'couch', 'eat', 'bon', 'bons', 'Pet', 'pomeranian', 'Especially', 'when', 'criminal', 'enterprises', 'result', 'going', 'jail', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'then', 'still', 'being', 'broke', 'entire', 'relationship', 'really', 'laughable', 'believing', 'bright', 'enough', 'accomplish', 'aforementioned', 'yet', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'enough', 'want', 'be', ""'old"", 'lady', 'even', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'off', 'fooling', 'porn', 'stars', 'Even', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'wives', 'shot', 'back', 'head', 'one', 'gang', 'members', 'Even', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'caught', 'destined', 'go', 'prison', 'Even', 'when', 'club', 'members', 'wife', 'beaten', 'death', 'left', 'ditch', 'side', 'road', 'Oh', 'yes', 'gang', 'rape', 'main', 'characters', 'mother', 'lady', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'career', 'choice', 'lot', 'upside', 'it.Speaking', 'jail', 'one', 'poor', 'sob', 'who', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'currently', 'jail', 'one', 'good', 'eye', 'poked', 'out', 'wife', 'killed', 'put', 'death', 'row', 'due', 'being', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'cant', 'help', 'think', 'maybe', 'continuing', 'devotion', 'gang', 'misplaced', 'really', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'well', 'gang', 'constantly', 'be', 'asking', 'favors', 'gather', 'intel', 'etc', 'lost', 'one', 'good', 'eye', 'wife', 'freedom', 'near', 'future', 'life', 'gang', 'point', 'think', ""'d"", 'just', 'have', 'tell', 'buddies', 'go', 'pound', 'sand', ""'ve"", 'done', 'enough', 'Especially', 'even', 'did', 'get', 'out', 'could', 'never', 'ride', 'motorcycle', 'again', 'only', '10', '%', 'vision', 'left', 'club', 'sort', 'rule', 'effect', 'cant', 'ride', 'cant', 'be', 'member.These', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'least', 'inconsistences', 'saw', 'Not', 'too', 'terrible', 'bit', 'silly', 'unbelievable.On', 'other', 'hand', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'are', 'also', 'pretty', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'wont', 'delve', 'detail', 'other', 'say', 'laughs', 'make', 'unbelievable', 'bits', 'pale', 'bit.Overall', 'fun', 'watch', 'as', 'long', 'dont', 'watch', 'critical', 'mindset']",N/A

Important backstory enters the stories and how the characters respond is often fascinating. As the fate of a baby is at stake, the viewer is sympathetically drawn into the flow. The sociopathic behavior of some are creative developments which allows one to realize their arc is perhaps deserved. The acting continues to as great as in previous seasons.

Taking the whole outlaw anti-hero story and tacking it on to a biker gang is something original. When you insert the story of one of the main members seeking revenge against member involved that may have killed his father, it takes it to a whole new level.At the end of season two we watched as Gemma Morrow (Katey Sagal) was framed for murder by conniving federal agent Stahl (Ally Walker) and the kidnapping of Abel, the son of the club's VP Jax (Charlie Hunnam). This season opens with everyone trying to find the child and to keep Gemma safe.As the series progresses we have an escape by Gemma, a meeting with her father and her subsequent return to custody as she tries to save not only her son but the club as well. Each step of the way agent Stahl just seems more and more dirty until she commits an act that shows her for what she truly is.The club continues to try and find clues as to who kidnapped Abel while continuing to do business selling guns. Through various contacts they discover that the child has been taken to Ireland, where the guns have been coming from via the IRA. It is also a location that Jax father was fond of and where a chapter of the Sons has been going since his time there.The plot lines twist and turn within each other as the Sons go global by popping across the ocean and heading to Ireland. But once there they discover things are not what they appear to be with both the IRA and the chapter of the Sons. Not only that but we're also introduced to a woman that Jax father had an affair with as well as a child.The story deepens, solutions are found and the club returns to their home base only to find more problems with their Russian connections. In the end a completely unexpected twists comes about that results in a set up for the current season.This series plays out more like a movie than something you'd find on TV. I'm not just talking about the language or occasional nudity but the whole way it tells a story. And each episode never feels like it's been padded down to make it longer or to draw the story out. Each piece of the puzzle fits snuggly into the next not just making the story a much more epic one but working bits and pieces of the past into the bigger picture that began with Jax search for the truth.There are several other sub plots involved in this season but the above is the main focus. Through it all the Sons of Anarchy are confronted on all sides be it law enforcement, rival clubs, traitors in their midst, the IRA, the Russians or more. But they survive. And even though what they're doing is illegal, even though these are violent men, you still find yourself rooting for them.It's difficult to keep a drama going from year to year or even week to week and still hold a viewer's interest. But SONS OF ANARCHY does it and does it well. If you haven't seen it, make a point of doing so. It might be too raw for some, but it's a well made series that deserves to be seen.",4,SONS ABROAD,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3041,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'turned', 'series', 'season', 'two', 'was', 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'jump', 'immediately', 'Taking', 'whole', 'outlaw', 'anti-hero', 'story', 'tacking', 'biker', 'gang', 'something', 'original', 'When', 'insert', 'story', 'one', 'main', 'members', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'member', 'involved', 'may', 'have', 'killed', 'father', 'whole', 'new', 'level.At', 'end', 'season', 'two', 'watched', 'Gemma', 'Morrow', 'Katey', 'Sagal', 'was', 'framed', 'murder', 'conniving', 'federal', 'agent', 'Stahl', 'Ally', 'Walker', 'kidnapping', 'Abel', 'son', 'club', 'VP', 'Jax', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'season', 'everyone', 'trying', 'find', 'child', 'keep', 'Gemma', 'safe.As', 'series', 'have', 'escape', 'Gemma', 'meeting', 'father', 'subsequent', 'return', 'custody', 'save', 'not', 'only', 'son', 'club', 'as', 'well', 'step', 'way', 'agent', 'Stahl', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'dirty', 'act', 'what', 'truly', 'is.The', 'club', 'try', 'find', 'clues', 'who', 'kidnapped', 'Abel', 'continuing', 'do', 'business', 'selling', 'guns', 'various', 'contacts', 'discover', 'child', 'been', 'taken', 'Ireland', 'where', 'guns', 'have', 'been', 'coming', 'IRA', 'also', 'location', 'Jax', 'father', 'was', 'fond', 'where', 'chapter', 'Sons', 'been', 'going', 'time', 'there.The', 'plot', 'lines', 'twist', 'turn', 'other', 'Sons', 'go', 'global', 'popping', 'ocean', 'heading', 'Ireland', 'once', 'discover', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'appear', 'be', 'IRA', 'chapter', 'Sons', 'Not', 'only', ""'re"", 'also', 'introduced', 'woman', 'Jax', 'father', 'had', 'affair', 'as', 'well', 'child.The', 'story', 'deepens', 'solutions', 'are', 'found', 'club', 'returns', 'home', 'base', 'only', 'find', 'more', 'problems', 'Russian', 'connections', 'end', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'results', 'set', 'up', 'current', 'season.This', 'series', 'out', 'more', 'movie', 'something', ""'d"", 'find', 'TV', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'language', 'occasional', 'nudity', 'whole', 'way', 'story', 'episode', 'never', 'been', 'padded', 'down', 'make', 'longer', 'draw', 'story', 'out', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'snuggly', 'next', 'not', 'just', 'making', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'epic', 'one', 'working', 'bits', 'pieces', 'past', 'bigger', 'picture', 'began', 'Jax', 'search', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'sub', 'plots', 'involved', 'season', 'above', 'main', 'focus', 'Sons', 'Anarchy', 'are', 'confronted', 'sides', 'be', 'law', 'enforcement', 'rival', 'clubs', 'traitors', 'midst', 'IRA', 'Russians', 'more', 'survive', 'even', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'illegal', 'even', 'are', 'violent', 'men', 'still', 'find', 'rooting', 'them.It', 'difficult', 'keep', 'drama', 'going', 'year', 'year', 'even', 'week', 'week', 'still', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'SONS', 'OF', 'ANARCHY', 'well', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'make', 'point', 'doing', 'so', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'raw', 'well', 'made', 'series', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

The difference is she is already aware, where is in BB, Skyler was dragged into it after the fact.Anyway the acting and characters in this show are amazing.  Katey Sagal, (Peg Bundy of Married with Children), really pulls off this dramatic role.  I love her in this show.  She fully supports her guys, but we also see such emotional depth, as she loves her grandson, son, and husband, and even dad, with all her heart and will truly do anything for them.  Her heartbreak in seasons 2 and 3 with what happens to her and  being separated from her family really shows.  I also love how she works with her son's girlfriend, Tara (a good girl), to get things done.We also get to see more character depth of the guys in the club in the 2nd and 3rd seasons, as they introduce some of their family and children backstories.  These are bad dudes, but they have families as well that they will do what they can to protect them.  We also see the bad guys working with the cops and politicians in the town to keep their town the way they want it.I am no motorcycle enthusiast, but I have family that are, some belonged to their own mc clubs, and they all seem to love and support each other.  Another thing I like about the show from what I have heard is how they are men's clubs, the men make the decisions, the women just there to serve.  The women are just their ""old ladies"".  I like how this show gives these ""ladies"" their own side stories working together.  We also get to see them working with and against other ethnic motorcycle clubs/groups/gangs.Give it a shot.

The drama is heightened and the show seems to be taking on a new direction, with less emphasis on the actual activities of the Sons, and more focus on why they do what they do.  I'll be eager to see how the plot develops; without giving away anything, some decisions have been made at the end of the first episode that have the potential to drastically alter the make up of the show and the direction it continues in.  This should show us as the viewers a new side of the Club, and expand on the already prodigious talents of Kurt Sutter and his production team.The show has the same sort of gritty feel as the Shield did a few years back, and even features a few of the same actors, most notably the guy who played Kurtis ""Lem"" Lemansky.  Somehow the Sons has a cleaner feel to it, and while it never drags and never has any lulls in the suspense or action, it manages to be a less jerky show than the Shield - it doesn't have that same light editing real world feel to it, but instead relies on well-developed characters, engrossing story lines, and an incredibly talented cast and writing staff to carry the show.

I am now looking forward to season four. I don't have cable so I have to wait for the dvd.I might spoil the show for those who haven't seen it yet. So read at your own risk.I am so very happy Agent June Stahl is dead. I know this is just a show. But I hate her so much (in the show). She is a heartless person. When Chief Wayne Unser told her that Gemma was rapped she looked so sad for Gemma. But I kept thinking Whatever you don't care. I can't believe how ugly they make June. I looked up pictures of her off the net and she is a very pretty woman. Why did they make her such an ugly person for the show? She could be beautiful and evil at once.I can't believe Opie is getting married to Lyla already. His wife hasn't been gone long enough. I thought that as soon he started messing with Lyla. I'm surprised Lyla doesn't seem to regret having an abortion. I think there should have been a scene with Lyla crying to Tara about her mistake on having an abortion. I wonder if Opie is going to find out in the later episodes. I don't know since I have to wait for the dvd.You know that scene when Lyla went to Tara telling her she needs an abortion was written by a man. Because she just lost her only son do to a drive by.
