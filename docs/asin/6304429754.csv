(In 1974, Hawks said he'd originally offered the RED RIVER lead role to Gary Cooper, but Coop felt the character was too nasty to suit his screen image.)As head of a crew trying for the first time to herd cattle over the Chisolm Trail, Thomas Dunson (Wayne) is such a tyrant that his men and his own son (Clift) turn against him. They force Dunson out and continue on with the herd, leaving him to plot an angry revenge.A classic fistfight between father and son that occurs later on somehow sets everything right; Old man Dunson isn't such a bastid after all. Only in Hollywood.The outstanding cast includes William Self, who later produced many famous TV series, and Shelley Winters in a walk-on as a dance hall girl travellng with the wagon train. Also here in an uncredited cameo is Tom Tyler, a silent and sound era western and serial star who was a direct competitor of Wayne's when he was coming up. This former weightlifting champ was the original Captain Marvel. Rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma curtailed his career.

He settled on a huge stretch of land, picking up an orphan leading a cow from the wagon train he left behind which was attacked by Indians. So with a total of two cows and one bull, in 14 years he had a huge herd, and the orphan boy had grown up to be played by Montgomery Clift, looking very young and awfully handsome. He's like a son to Wayne, who has never married. So they have a lot of cattle which aren't worth even three cents a head in Texas, and decide to drive them north to Missouri. They hear tales of the problems others have had, but Wayne is so determined that he pushes on, no matter what.This is the conventional part of the Chisum trail story. The rest is so very unconventional that I won't spoil it for you, except to say that along the way the two owners have a falling out, and Wayne, uncharacteristically, is off the screen for a good half hour before he shows up again.Of course there's a beautiful woman or two (one only seen very briefly), and even there Wayne does not do the usual thing about her. It is, in the end, quite an original script. The early part in Texas is very gritty and realistic, although when on the trail, it is pretty obvious that the cowboys and the cattle were filmed separately. Other than that, it is a very well done movie indeed, for all it is in black and white.

421188,A1BJOEQSRX2IBM,6304429754,"Bertin Ramirez ""justareviewer""","[20, 23]","Without a doubt one of the best westerns ever made. The film has  everything; a truly epic scope, Montgomery Clift, Howard Hawks and of  course John Wayne. Easily the best film about cattle driving. A western of  epic proportions with awe-inspiring cinematography by Russell Harlen that  perfectly captures the beauty of the open trail. This film is also blessed  with one of Dimitri Tiomkin's best scores, Tiomkin also scored 'High Noon'.  Montgomery Clift is excellent in his film debut as Matt, a brooding  performance that showcased his talents that would later flourish in movies  like 'From Here To Eternity' and 'A Place In The Sun'. But John Wayne  surprised everyone from John Ford to himself creating an extremely complex  multi-layered character; Thomas Dunson, that remains one of his best  performances, second only to Ethan Edwards in Ford's 'The Searchers'. And  what would a great Howard Hawks western be without Walter Brennan? An  ambitious western that covers a lot of ground and is filled with classic  Hawksian touches especially during the campfire scenes. The scenes right  before the stampede where there is complete silence (only a coyote is heard  from a distance) and any sound could stir up hell-storm of crazy running  cows is pure Howard Hawks. And then one of the most exciting sequences in  western history ensues, easily the best stampede ever filmed. As for the  story, it is basically 'Mutiny On The Bounty' for the open trail. Dunson is  being forced to round up his cattle (and some of his neighbors) and take  them up the Chisholm Trail. An epic and extremely difficult cattle-drive  becomes possible because of Dunson's determination. But when another easier  trail is made clear but Dunson decides to do it his was, the hard way. This  makes the men uneasy and Dunson becomes a tyrant and slowly goes mad. This  is one of the best psychological transformations of any character in film  history. This causes a mutiny that is lead by Matt (Clift), his own  step-son, that makes for one of the most compelling conflicts in film  history. But, as memorable as this western is, it still has one or two 'bad  scenes'. Basically almost all the scenes with Joanne Dru are badly made,  save the scene when Dunson asks her to bear his son. The scene when Clift  first meats her during the Indian attack is especially bad. And the silly  ending is a huge letdown. These two driving forces clash in a  much-anticipated showdown and shouldn't be stopped by a woman. The  intensity near the end, I think, was so unbearable and Hawks had too many  emotions exploding in those few moments that maybe he didn't know how to  handle them. But still this remains a memorable western and one of the  best.

It boasts a stunning Dimitri Tiomkin score, terrific  B&amp;W photography by Russell Harlan, a wonderful performance from  Montgomery Clift, a powerful (if typically one-note) performance from John  Wayne ... and then Joanne Dru enters the story and it basically falls apart  from this point on. She is so completely incompetent that she manages to  almost sink the film! Her dialogue is, admittedly, terrible (Hawks bragged  that he wrote most of it!), but her line readings are so terrible that it  just makes the awkward dialogue even more awkward. The ending is absurd, a  complete build-up to a deadly collision and it ends up a rather weak  fist-fight. Perhaps, had Wayne's performance included emotional shadings,  the ending might have worked, but since he is so one-note hard and  uncompromising throughout, not for one moment do I believe the final  sequence. In the original Borden Chase novel, the character dies at the  end. It should have happened here, also (same major flaw in Wayne's The  Searchers, too). On top of which, the John Ireland character is built up as  a major challenge to Montgomery Clift, but this is simply dropped halfway  through. Indeed, the Ireland character is allowed to fizzle out.

Going west with a wagon train in 1850, Dunson--who is presumably a veteran, since he wears Cavalry trousers--leaves it, and his beloved Fen (Colleen Gray), to make a home in Texas, just in time to escape the Indian attack that destroys the rest of the outfit.  With his longtime partner Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan), he picks up a 14-year-old boy, Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn), who has been orphaned by the Indians, and establishes the ""Red River D"" brand near the Rio Grande.  15 years later, he's built up one of the biggest spreads in Texas, but in the aftermath of the Civil War, like all the rest of the state, he's broke, and takes a desperate chance on a vast cattle drive to Sedalia, Mo.  His obsession soon alienates his crew, and Matt (Montgomery Clift) finds he can't ignore the man's vagaries despite his deep respect for him.  The break comes when they learn of a purported new trail town called Abilene which, if they can reach it, will keep them out of the clutches of the border bandits who infest Sedalia's vicinity.  But Dunson knows Sedalia is there and isn't so sure about Abilene.  Matt finds himself with no alternative but a mutiny and the takeover of the herd, even though he knows that a thwarted Dunson, if left alive, will do his best to catch up and kill him.Like most Golden Age Western movies, this one somewhat mangles history--Texas made no drives north at all in 1865 (most of her sons didn't return from wartime service till well into the summer), and Abilene didn't exist till '67; if the script had set the story in the latter year, given Dunson a drive to Sedalia the previous season in which he lost much of his herd (as did many Texas cowmen that year), and then introduced Abilene as an alternative, it would have made just as good a story and more accurate reality.  But the conflict between Dunson and Matt, the perils of the drive, and the wonderful crew, including Noah Beery, Jr., as Buster McGee, Harry Carey, Jr., as Dan Latimer (his father, Harry Sr., also appears as an Abilene cattle buyer), Chief Yowlachie as cook's assistant Quo, Hank Worden as Simms Reeves, Paul Fix as Teeler Yacey, and John Ireland as the young gunman Cherry Valance, make up for the inaccuracies, which are really minor compared to those of some other films of the era.

421201,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6304429754,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[3, 5]","A great genre film is not necessarily a great piece of cinema, for the dictates of genre often run counter to the dictates of art; namely that genre demands familiar elements (aka clich&eacute;s). As good an example of this dictum that can be found is director Howard Hawks' 1948 (although filmed in 1946) black and white western Red River. There is great debate amongst western aficionados as to who was the greater director of westerns, John Ford or Howard Hawks? Well, if one compares the two westerns most consider the two directors' apexes in the genre, Ford's The Searchers and this film, it's no contest. Red River and Hawks win in a walk. That's because Hawks was basically concerned with narrative and characters while Ford obsessed over myth making and caricatures. Even Ford tacitly admitted Hawks was the superior craftsman, for when he first saw Red River he is reputed to have exclaimed, of star John Wayne: `I didn't know the big son of a bitch could act.' Both films, of course, feature Wayne in an anti-hero role, and both are sweeping tales. But, Red River features realistic characterization, great dialogue and comedy in a first rate screenplay written by Charles Schnee and Borden Chase, which was adapted from Chase's tale The Chisholm Trail. But, above all, the film benefits from the screen debut of Montgomery Clift, who steals the film from Wayne as easily as his character does the cattle herd they are driving north to sell. Note the scene where Matt steps inside a cattleman's office in Abilene. Watch Clift's face as he ducks, because it's been months since he was under a roof. That's the sort of realistic reaction that takes little effort in writing or acting, but adds up to lifting a pedestrian film into a greater realism.... The film reaches out and scrapes greatness in the scenes between Wayne and Clift, as Dunson and Matt. Rarely have two macho male roles been so convincingly written- and considering this was the 1940s, it makes that fact all the more special. Wayne actually emotes a bit above his usual monosyllabics, and Clift acts and reacts to Wayne better than any co-star I've seen. One really gets the sense of their having known each other for years. Two other relationships that work are the ones between Groot and Dunson, especially when Groot finally stands up to Dunson, after years of cowering, and the one between Matt and Cherry, as young gunslingers whose guns stand in for penises in one well written and acted scene that prefigures, albeit far more realistically, some of the homoeroticism that would end up in the laughable vomitus of Brokeback Mountain.But, make no mistake, the major theme of Red River is the classic Oedipal one, where the figurative son must supplant the father, and until the very end, this is the core of the film, and what pushes it well above most westerns. It is a complex film that rises above its genre, but not far enough to reach that ineffable area reserved for the greatest of artworks, even if it can legitimately make a claim to being a great western. Whether or not it would have succeeded in reaching that lofty status without the feminine element is debatable, but that the female element drags it down from unadulterated greatness is not. Now there's a classic trope: blame it on the broads!

Wayne's film character is established forever in this movie about a man who travels with a lone companion Walter Brennan to Texas to establish a huge cattle ranch along with a young man who survived a wagon train massacare. Moving 20 years forward, Wayne is the leader of a cattle drive to move the herd across Indian country in a desperate post war effort to get the first ever drive to Abiline. Wayne takes all the responsibility,part of his character that stays with him thoughout future films, that wears him down into a virtual tyrant that is exiled from his own herd. Wounded by his own fast shooting adopted son played wonderfully by the diminative Montgomery Cliff, Wayne vows to return and kill him. As the herd moves forward into the hostile territory, they all know that Wayne is coming up from behind and he is seeking vengence. The final scene is full of tension as Howard Hawks makes the scene more even between the small Cliff and the 6' 4"" Wayne by having Wayne shot with a significant wound to give the story more of an even fight appeal. This allows Wayne, with significant blood loss, to be able to fight the modest built Cliff to an even fight. The sound track is rollicking and perfect for a cattle drive and who better for a chuck wagon cook than the imortal Walter Brennan. Look for both famous character actors Harry Carey and Harry Carey.

Furthermore, the copy chosen is not of the quality one could have expected from an eminent Hollywood studio. Shameful. Howard Hawks's RED RIVER is on my list of the ten best westerns ever made. Against the legendary John Wayne, Montgomery Clift plays the character of the Duke's adopted son. His low-keyed performance is, in my opinion, unique at that pre-Marlon Brando time. From his first appearance as a young boy on, Howard Hawks characterizes him as -a man with a gun- and gives to this manly attribute a symbolic role throughout the entire movie. Hence, the relation Montgomery Clift-John Ireland can be read at a level invisible for the blind monks of the Hays Code. A recurrent theme appearing in the Hawksian filmography is the theme of the Strong Woman. So let's admire the character of Joanne Dru who is not disturbed at all by the arrow stuck in her shoulder and who, later in the movie, is the only character who's got the guts to face John Wayne, the granite Father. RED RIVER is a movie that must absolutely have a place in your library. It's a movie that has influenced a lot Steven Spielberg and company , it's a milestone in Movie History. It's a masterpiece.

Buckley,"[27, 31]","Having weighed-in on _The Culpepper Cattle Company_, I have to genuflect at the altar of THE cattle-drive movie-- _Red River_.This film pre-dates _The Searchers_ by about eight years.  The lead character, Tom Dunson, is a  sort of prototype for Ethan Edwards.  This is John Wayne without sentiment  or schmaltz, until the final scene which differs from the story on which  the film is based, and which jars a bit.That being said, _Red River_  still stands as the definitive cattle-drive movie.  Wayne/Dunson builds an  empire but then must head the herd north on a drive that simply _has_ to  get through-- despite conflicts with nature, rustlers, Indians, and between  Dunson and his men, including his adopted son, Matthew Garth.Wayne is  cast against his own stereotype as Dunson and comes across as a hard and  unlikeable character.  Walter Brennan as his sidekick, Groot, nearly steals  the show just as he did (again) in Hawk's _Rio Bravo_.  Montgomery Clift  does a passable job as Matthew Garth, but is outclassed by John Ireland as  Cherry Valance, the gunfighter turned cowhand.The rest of the cast is  outstanding.  You need only look at the cast list to appreciate the fine  ensemble company that Howard Hawks put together for this movie.  This is  also on of Dimitri Tiomkin's finest musical scores.Finally, I agree with  Maltin on this point: beware edited and abridged copies of this film.

421209,A2TWIZ33KJCQ54,6304429754,"Dr. Luther Wolfgang Polaris ""LWP""","[14, 14]","OVERVIEW: A MILESTONE PERFORMANCE FOR JOHN WAYNE""RED RIVER"" depicts Capitalism and Rugged Individualism with maximum human stress added, resembling a ""Mutiny On The Bounty"" culminating during a desperate cattle drive along the ""Red River"". By no means is this film any less dramatic or hard-hitting for having been made in the Western genre.ABOUT ""RED RIVER""It was Wayne's and Hawks' first collaboration [1948]. It went a million dollars over budget, costing 4 million dollars, and it introduced Montgomery Cliff in a leading role. There were nominations and awards received:Best Editing (nom) Christian Nyby 1948 AcademyBest Story (nom) Borden Chase 1948 AcademyBest Director (nom) Howard Hawks 1948 Directors Guild of AmericaU.S. National Film Registry (win) 1989 Library of CongressBut most of all, we see the Duke in a very nuanced and unexpectedly complex role where things are going far from right from the get-go. Sure, he's a hero, but he's not a simple or predictable one. His dark side is very near the surface and the kind of stress that a desperate cattle drive raises presses everyone to his limit. The results are -- ""RED RIVER""!LIVING AT THE LIMIT: THE RESULTS ARE -- ""RED RIVER""!Throughout the film, virtually every scene has major hurdles for our characters to overcome, especially Wayne, and they are going to have to deal with these hurdles like human beings -- NOT GOD-LIKE ICONS. In essence, there are no short cuts for the cast in the way of simple and expected outcomes. This makes the film AWESOME during every one of its 133 minutes. The rare dark side seen of Wayne is shocking in its unusual and mostly [until the finale] unsentimental excellence. WOW!CONCLUSIONS - ""RED RIVER"" IS JUST 'THAT' GOOD & 'THAT' SOPHISTICATEDSomehow, this is one of the rare superb films that I missed seeing when I was young. It was a treat to see it now. The film boasts Wayne in an Oscar-worthy performance and he is well-complemented with a superb cast which included:Montgomery Clift - Matthew GarthJoanne Dru - Tess MillayWalter Brennan - Groot NadineColeen Gray - FenJohn Ireland - Cherry ValanceHarry Carey - Mr. MillvilleHarry Carey, Jr. - Dan LatimerPaul Fix - Teeler YaceyThe whole cast really played it up a notch, probably inspired by Wayne's fantastic performance. I plan on seeing this film a number of times over the coming months, at which time I hope to add more comments as this film is just that good and that sophisticated.ABOUT THE DVD: FEATURES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPRECIATEDExcellent Widescreen transfer of both audio and videoDVD Features: Available Subtitles: English, Spanish, FrenchAvailable Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 1.0)",5,ONE OF THE WAYNE'S BEST & MOST NUANCED PERFORMANCES,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,2663,"['OVERVIEW', 'MILESTONE', 'PERFORMANCE', 'FOR', 'JOHN', 'WAYNE', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'Capitalism', 'Rugged', 'Individualism', 'maximum', 'human', 'stress', 'added', 'resembling', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'culminating', 'desperate', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Red', 'River', 'means', 'film', 'less', 'dramatic', 'hard-hitting', 'having', 'been', 'made', 'Western', 'genre.ABOUT', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'was', 'Wayne', 'Hawks', 'first', 'collaboration', '[', '1948', ']', 'went', 'million', 'dollars', 'budget', 'costing', '4', 'million', 'dollars', 'introduced', 'Montgomery', 'Cliff', 'leading', 'role', 'were', 'nominations', 'awards', 'received', 'Best', 'Editing', 'nom', 'Christian', 'Nyby', '1948', 'AcademyBest', 'Story', 'nom', 'Borden', 'Chase', '1948', 'AcademyBest', 'Director', 'nom', 'Howard', 'Hawks', '1948', 'Directors', 'Guild', 'AmericaU.S', 'National', 'Film', 'Registry', 'win', '1989', 'Library', 'CongressBut', 'most', 'see', 'Duke', 'very', 'nuanced', 'unexpectedly', 'complex', 'role', 'where', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'far', 'right', 'get-go', 'Sure', 'hero', 'not', 'simple', 'predictable', 'one', 'dark', 'side', 'very', 'surface', 'kind', 'stress', 'desperate', 'cattle', 'drive', 'presses', 'everyone', 'limit', 'results', 'are', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'LIVING', 'AT', 'THE', 'LIMIT', 'RESULTS', 'ARE', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'film', 'virtually', 'scene', 'major', 'hurdles', 'characters', 'overcome', 'especially', 'Wayne', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'deal', 'hurdles', 'human', 'beings', 'NOT', 'GOD-LIKE', 'ICONS', 'essence', 'are', 'short', 'cuts', 'cast', 'way', 'simple', 'expected', 'outcomes', 'film', 'AWESOME', 'one', '133', 'minutes', 'rare', 'dark', 'side', 'seen', 'Wayne', 'shocking', 'unusual', 'mostly', '[', 'finale', ']', 'unsentimental', 'excellence', 'WOW', 'CONCLUSIONS', 'RED', 'RIVER', 'JUST', ""'THAT"", 'GOOD', ""'THAT"", 'SOPHISTICATEDSomehow', 'one', 'rare', 'superb', 'films', 'missed', 'seeing', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'treat', 'see', 'now', 'film', 'Wayne', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'well-complemented', 'superb', 'cast', 'included', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Matthew', 'GarthJoanne', 'Dru', 'Tess', 'MillayWalter', 'Brennan', 'Groot', 'NadineColeen', 'Gray', 'FenJohn', 'Ireland', 'Cherry', 'ValanceHarry', 'Carey', 'Mr.', 'MillvilleHarry', 'Carey', 'Jr.', 'Dan', 'LatimerPaul', 'Fix', 'Teeler', 'YaceyThe', 'whole', 'cast', 'really', 'played', 'up', 'notch', 'probably', 'inspired', 'Wayne', 'fantastic', 'performance', 'plan', 'seeing', 'film', 'number', 'times', 'coming', 'months', 'time', 'hope', 'add', 'more', 'comments', 'film', 'just', 'good', 'sophisticated.ABOUT', 'DVD', 'FEATURES', 'WOULD', 'HAVE', 'BEEN', 'APPRECIATEDExcellent', 'Widescreen', 'transfer', 'audio', 'videoDVD', 'Features', 'Available', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'FrenchAvailable', 'Audio', 'Tracks', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '1.0']",N/A

In the main roles are John Wayne as Thomas Dunson, Montgomery Clift as his adopted son and eventually junior partner, Matthew 'Matt' Garth, Joanne Dru as Tess Millay, and Walter Brennan as wagonmaster Nadine Groot. The story is about a group of men moving to the Red River area in Texas for beef farming, and first using what later became known as the Chisholm Trail to the Abilene Kansas stockyards and railway point. The film is one of the famous quality Westerns, and notable for introducing Montgomery Clift, in addition to general fine acting, excellent photography, and an unhurried, but never boring pace.Rightly acclaimed and famous ever since: Footage from Red River was later incorporated into the opening montage of Wayne's last film, The Shootist, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne's character. John Ford--who worked with Wayne on many films (such as The Searchers, Stagecoach, and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance)--was so impressed with Wayne's performance that he is reported to have said, ""I didn't know the big son of a bitch could act"".

Even though its script has some flaws (especially the ending, which I find somewhat unrealistic), the fantastic scenery, music, acting and direction by Howard Hawks more than makes up for it.In Red River, Tom Dunson (John Wayne) builds a ranch from scratch alongside his adopted son, Matthew Garth (Montgomery Clift). By the time Matt returns from the war, Dunson has built a huge ranch, but is unable to sell his cattle in the South, because there is no demand for it. Consequently, Dunson plans the largest, longest cattle-drive ever attempted. As they progess, however, the normally strict yet somewhat tolerant Dunson becomes a tyrant, and Matt is eventually forced to take over command, leaving the angered Dunson behind, vowing to kill him.Anyhow, this movie features wonderful performances from Wayne as the tyrannical leader and from Clift (in his first movie) as the milder son.

Out of every character in Red River, he was the most emotional/real one of the bunch.  Here was a man who was broke because of the civil war.  He had one opportunity to make money from his cattle.  He had to make an arduous trek to get them to market.  As a bit of a control freak, he was in the untenable possible of dealing with unpredictable cattle and men.  Trying to rein in both over many miles and a long period of time would have frustrated anyone.  That he was doomed to fail in that regard was something that never crossed his mind.  He was in command and thought that would do the trick.  Unfortunately, neither the men nor the cattle would cooperate with his plan.  He exploded with fury and made a rash decision, the hanging of two men he considered thieves.  It was a natural response albeit, a wrong one, but it was human.  The men, under the influence of Dunson's pseudo-son (Montgomery Clift), mutiny and take off with his cattle.  Perhaps not the wisest choice, I would have tied him up and chucked him into the one remaining chuck wagon until he cooled off.  Of course he was a little miffed, who wouldn't be, and yes, in the heat of the moment, he threatened to kill his pseudo-son, also, a natural response given the circumstances.  That's what I love about this movie; it's very emotional for a Western.  Everyone was on edge, everyone stewed and fretted and kept a watch over their shoulders for the vengeful Dunson, raging on their tail.  I found it a major feat that Wayne managed to make his angry Dunson so sympathetic; how could you not feel sorry for him!  His whole world was crumbling around him and the one person he felt the most for, in effect, betrayed him.  How they eventually resolved it was a little abrupt but I like happy endings.  I liked that it came full circle, brand to brand.  The only complaint I have isn't about the film, it's about the lousy transfer to DVD.  Someone needs to step up and put out a better treatment.  This is shameful.  But, better a lousy copy than no copy at all for my collection.And yes, Walter Brennan (Oscar winner of 3 best supporting actor awards) easily stole the movie.

The major drawback, however, is the ending fight between Dunson and Garth is shortened quite a bit on this version!  Peter Bogdanovich mentions in the supplements that in order to get the truest version of Howard Hawks' vision you would need to watch Disc 1 up until the fight and then switch to Disc 2 to get the complete ending.

The script and characters were unique for its day, when most Westerns had fallen prey to strict, good-guys-in-white-hats formulas, thus paving the way for for the likes of &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Shane&quot;.  Wayne's and Brennan's performances are standouts by any measure, and the supporting cast of many John Ford-MGM stalwarts is equal to the task (you even find unique appearances by father-and-son veterans Harry Carey and Carey Jr, not to mention some B-Western bad guys from the Republic lot given a chance to do some real acting).  Despite the contrived and awkward ending, the story and characters are riveting and exceptionally engrossing.  Director Hawks seems to have had a field day here, as the production values are superb, especially for a western.  The only obvious downside (and this is strictly a personal bias) is the shuffle-and-mumble Method techniques of Montgomery Clift, whose acting here and in later years remained somewhat contrived and stilted.  As for that old standby, John Ireland, he reveals a more natural style that only highlights Clift's somewhat affected effort in the scenes they share.  The ending aside, this is one of those classics that can be watched again and again to reveal new detail with each viewing.

The extra width of the cardboard 4 disc holder along with the wasted book makes this item 1.5 inches wide.

I used to think someone did a poor job of casting women in these Hawk/Wayne films, but after re-watching this film recently, I now believe that the scriptwriters for these movies just didn't know how to write realistic dialogue for women.  It wasn't how they said their lines, it was that their lines were inane. Too bad.

Cattle baron Tom Dunson (John Wayne) begins with a small group of cows. After 14 years of hard work, he owns a herd consisting of 10,000 head of cattle. The cows are branded with the Red River mark (parallel curves which represent the banks of the Red River).At the end of the American Civil War, the area is destitute, and Dunson's cattle have little value locally. For this reason, Dunson wants to drive them along the Chisholm Trail to Missouri. But all kinds of problems develop during the long, tedious drive. Quitters abandon Dunson. He finds and shoots them. Noises cause massive cattle stampedes. Finally, a mutineer takes over and leads the herd to Abilene, Kansas, to be sold for a hefty price and then loaded on a railroad. Will Dunson still get his rightful share of his life's work?This movie comes in black and white. Made in 1948, it shows a young John Wayne.

421230,A106016KSI0YQ,6304429754,Jay Dickson,"[0, 1]","Howard Hawks directed this beloved 1948 Western about the first driving of the Chisholm Trail after the Civil War on a cosmic scale; the sheer scope of the project is staggering, with enough gigantic stampedes and long shots of endless wagon trains to practically beg the audience to fall to their knees. The scale of the story and the passions in involved is so operatic that you keep expecting the whole thing to be set to music (unfortunately, the film's composer Dmitri Tiomkin seems to have had the same idea, and pulls in an incredibly loud and overwhelming orchestral piece when the drive starts that is one of the few truly unhappily misjudged aspects of the work). Although there are almost no women in the film, the two notable ones who are here in effect bookend the work: first Colleen Gray as John Wayne's girlfriend, left behind when he leaves a wagon train to , and who is almost immediately slain by marauding Indians; then the unusual Joanne Dru, as the love interest for Wayne's adopted son Montgomery Clift, who almost meets the same fate. Most of the film is instead about Wayne and Clift and the many men involved in getting Wayne's cattle driven to market, and Hawks constantly foregrounds the crises among them of masculine authority, with at one point Clift and his handsome rival John Ireland literally comparing the sizes of their guns.The whole thing is basically a mutiny film set on dry land, with threatened floggings and maroonings and posturing tension. It's also clearly some sort of allegory for Cold War imperialism, since Wayne's character takes whatever land or cattle he wants, and justifies it with his guns. The effects are always fascinating and often quite beautiful: many of the scenes are filmed at the violet hour or in the early evening, and there are incredible shots of the Arizona landscape, used here to double for Texas (in one of the most beautiful, the end of a funeral sermon is counterpointed by the shadow of a giant cloud drifting over a butte in the background). The film is not without its longeurs, and there are some key scenes that seem somehow to be missing: although much is made early in the film of the rivalry between Clift's and Ireland's characters, the promised clash between them never finally materializes, perhaps because Ireland's role (named ""Cherry Valance""!) was scaled down after Cary Grant refused to play it. But things are tremendously helped by the fine acting: Dru makes a distinct impression as the oddly talkative girlfriend for Clift, and Wayne brought out terrific things in his underwritten part (he always was best when his directors let him play darker parts). Although Clift's part also isn't fully fleshed out, he's at least quite memorable in his sexy black cowboy costume going fist to fist with Wayne; he is a bit outdone by the fine, tense child actor Mickey Kuhn, who plays the same character as a young boy.",4,Melodrama of beset manhood,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2905,"['Howard', 'Hawks', 'directed', 'beloved', '1948', 'Western', 'first', 'driving', 'Chisholm', 'Trail', 'Civil', 'War', 'cosmic', 'scale', 'sheer', 'scope', 'project', 'staggering', 'enough', 'gigantic', 'stampedes', 'long', 'shots', 'endless', 'wagon', 'trains', 'practically', 'beg', 'audience', 'fall', 'knees', 'scale', 'story', 'passions', 'involved', 'so', 'operatic', 'keep', 'expecting', 'whole', 'thing', 'be', 'set', 'music', 'unfortunately', 'film', 'composer', 'Dmitri', 'Tiomkin', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'idea', 'pulls', 'incredibly', 'loud', 'overwhelming', 'orchestral', 'piece', 'when', 'drive', 'one', 'few', 'truly', 'unhappily', 'misjudged', 'aspects', 'work', 'are', 'almost', 'women', 'film', 'two', 'notable', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'here', 'effect', 'bookend', 'work', 'first', 'Colleen', 'Gray', 'John', 'Wayne', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'wagon', 'train', 'who', 'almost', 'immediately', 'slain', 'marauding', 'Indians', 'then', 'unusual', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'love', 'interest', 'Wayne', 'adopted', 'son', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'who', 'almost', 'same', 'fate', 'Most', 'film', 'instead', 'Wayne', 'Clift', 'many', 'men', 'involved', 'getting', 'Wayne', 'cattle', 'driven', 'market', 'Hawks', 'constantly', 'crises', 'masculine', 'authority', 'one', 'point', 'Clift', 'handsome', 'rival', 'John', 'Ireland', 'literally', 'comparing', 'sizes', 'guns.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'basically', 'mutiny', 'film', 'set', 'dry', 'land', 'threatened', 'floggings', 'maroonings', 'posturing', 'tension', 'also', 'clearly', 'sort', 'allegory', 'Cold', 'War', 'imperialism', 'Wayne', 'character', 'land', 'cattle', 'justifies', 'guns', 'effects', 'are', 'always', 'fascinating', 'often', 'quite', 'beautiful', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'violet', 'hour', 'early', 'evening', 'are', 'incredible', 'shots', 'Arizona', 'landscape', 'used', 'here', 'double', 'Texas', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'end', 'funeral', 'sermon', 'counterpointed', 'shadow', 'giant', 'cloud', 'drifting', 'butte', 'background', 'film', 'not', 'longeurs', 'are', 'key', 'scenes', 'seem', 'somehow', 'be', 'missing', 'much', 'made', 'early', 'film', 'rivalry', 'Clift', 'Ireland', 'characters', 'promised', 'clash', 'never', 'finally', 'perhaps', 'Ireland', 'role', 'named', 'Cherry', 'Valance', 'was', 'scaled', 'down', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'refused', 'play', 'things', 'are', 'tremendously', 'helped', 'fine', 'acting', 'Dru', 'distinct', 'impression', 'oddly', 'talkative', 'girlfriend', 'Clift', 'Wayne', 'brought', 'out', 'terrific', 'things', 'underwritten', 'part', 'always', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'directors', 'let', 'play', 'darker', 'parts', 'Clift', 'part', 'also', ""n't"", 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'least', 'quite', 'memorable', 'sexy', 'black', 'cowboy', 'costume', 'going', 'fist', 'fist', 'Wayne', 'bit', 'outdone', 'fine', 'tense', 'child', 'actor', 'Mickey', 'Kuhn', 'who', 'same', 'character', 'young', 'boy']",N/A

421233,AT04V4H3AO3T5,6304429754,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[3, 4]","With RED RIVER, versatile director Howard Hawks, well-known for his screwball comedies (BRINGING UP BABY, HIS GIRL FRIDAY) made one of the greatest westerns ever in just his first attempt at the genre. This story of the epic first cattle drive up the Chisholm Trail in 1865 is noted for its fine acting performances as well as for its tension-filled and exciting storyline. This was also really the first film in which John Wayne notably plays a troubled anti-hero rather than the more conventional matinee-style hero or villain he was known for previously. The greatest roles that lay ahead in his career (particularly Ethan Edwards of THE SEARCHERS) would follow in this mold.Wayne plays Tom Dunson, a self-made but ruthless man who has built the largest ranch in Texas with 10,000 cattle that need to go to market. Montgomery Clift, in his first major film role, plays his adopted son Matt Garth, who has just returned from service in the Civil War. Tom and Matt and their cowhands set out on the 1000 mile drive intending to take their herd to Missouri. Although Dunson gives his men the option to opt out before the drive begins, he will permit no man who begins the journey to quit along the way. As the hardships mount up on the trail to Missouri and the men begin to hear of the new, safer Chisholm trail to Abilene, Kansas, morale drops. When Dunson refuses to go to Kansas due to uncertainty about its having access to a railroad, the men begin to leave. Several attempting to leave are shot dead by Dunson.Eventually, after Dunson attempts to hang some more deserters, Garth wrests control of the herd and steers them toward Kansas with Dunson vowing that he will kill him when he catches up to him. Despite the rather vile acts that Dunson commits, he is not an altogether unsympathetic character and Wayne plays the character in a well-nuanced performance. Garth clearly loves his adopted father but, at the risk of being perceived as ""soft,"" he is more empathetic and intelligent in his approaches to problem solving than is Dunson. The tension mounts as Garth tries to reach Kansas before the vengeful Dunson, even as he knows that he will eventually have to face him anyway.Leading the strong supporting cast is Walter Brennan, who is as great as he always is as chuckwagon driver ""Groot."" Also supporting this film are such Western stalwarts as Hank Worden (who was also a particular favorite of John Ford), John Ireland, Paul Fix, and Noah Beery Jr. (known to a later generation as ""Rocky"" on THE ROCKFORD FILES). On an interesting note, this was Harry Carey Jr's first film as well as the last film of Harry Carey Sr, and so is the only film in which the father and son appeared together (albeit in different scenes). Joanne Dru is appealing and attractive as the love interest. More trivially (for the trivia-minded), Richard Farnsworth and Shelly Winters have tiny, uncredited roles that fans of Where's Waldo? might want to watch for.RED RIVER, along withThe Searchers (John Wayne Collection)has always been on the top of my list of my favorite westerns. Anyon who doubts John Wayne's abilities as an actor need to check out these two films. While it is true when people say that the only character that John Wayne ever played was ""John Wayne,"" he was sometimes quite remarkable in playing that character.Jeremy W.

421237,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,6304429754,J. Michael Click,"[161, 164]","&quot;Red River&quot; deserves the adulation that critics, film scholars, and most importantly audiences have lavished on it since its premiere in 1948.  One of the earliest &quot;psychological&quot; westerns, preceded by Selznick's &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946) and followed by King's &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; (1950), etc., &quot;Red River&quot; maintains interest after half a century due to the unique tensions between its characters, and the supreme skill with which those characters are played.  Set against the backdrop of the first cattle drive along the Chisum Trail, the story basically boils down to an epic conflict between two men of different generations.  John Wayne is the older sharp-shooter who builds up an empire through ruthless wiles and steely determination; Montgomery Clift, who is equally proficient with a gun, is the young surrogate son who tends to manage through intellect and reason rather than violence.  These two opposing personalities and styles eventually erupt into a mortal combat under the strain of driving over 9,000 head of cattle across the hostile terrain of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.As the volatile Dunson, John Wayne gives one of his most finely nuanced performances.  Living by a personal code of ethics which doesn't always translate into lawful or even rational behavior, Wayne is neither sympathetic nor deplorable; he's simply human.  His performance is bolstered by the contrast provided by the quietly charasmatic Montgomery Clift, whose unspoken love and respect for Wayne's father figure shine through the fear and intimidation he expresses.  (Remarkably, this was Clift's first performance in front of the movie cameras; the stage-trained actor seems to have adapted instinctively to the more subtle technique required of film work.)  Various other characters come between these two to create some memorable triangles throughout the film.  Three-time Oscar winner Walter Brennan is wonderful as Wayne's longtime sidekick whose allegiance eventually shifts over to Clift; Paul Fix also does a fine job in a minor role as the character whose fate jumpstarts the conflict between the two leading men.  Most fascinating among the supporting cast is John Ireland who plays the curiously-named Cherry; the Freudian scene in which he and Clift admire each other's pistols, and then commence to shoot them off together is simply astonishing.  It's worth noting that Cherry is the first one to try and intervene during the climactic showdown between Wayne and the &quot;son&quot; he contemptuously characterizes as &quot;soft&quot;; equally significant is the fact that the character who finally brings resolution into the movie is a &quot;strong&quot; woman (played by Joanne Dru).The MGM DVD release of this classic United Artists film is, in my humble opinion, abominable.  The source print is visually a disaster, chock full of lines, jumps, flutters, speckles, and other visual noise.  The grays are grainy and at one point, the picture even is briefly - and distractingly - out of focus.  The sound isn't much better: it crackles and pops and the volume is inconsistent.  Adding insult to injury, there are no extras at all, not even cast biographies or production notes, much less a theatrical trailer.  This is one classic film that demands - and richly deserves - to be restored, remastered and repackaged.",4,***** Movie.  ** DVD.,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",2003,3371,"['quot', 'Red', 'River', 'quot', 'adulation', 'critics', 'film', 'scholars', 'most', 'importantly', 'audiences', 'have', 'lavished', 'premiere', '1948', 'One', 'earliest', 'quot', 'psychological', 'quot', 'westerns', 'preceded', 'Selznick', 'quot', 'Duel', 'Sun', 'quot', '1946', 'followed', 'King', 'quot', 'Gunfighter', 'quot', '1950', 'etc.', 'quot', 'Red', 'River', 'quot', 'interest', 'century', 'due', 'unique', 'tensions', 'characters', 'supreme', 'skill', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Set', 'backdrop', 'first', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Chisum', 'Trail', 'story', 'basically', 'down', 'epic', 'conflict', 'two', 'men', 'different', 'generations', 'John', 'Wayne', 'older', 'sharp-shooter', 'who', 'up', 'empire', 'ruthless', 'wiles', 'steely', 'determination', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'who', 'equally', 'proficient', 'gun', 'young', 'surrogate', 'son', 'who', 'manage', 'intellect', 'reason', 'rather', 'violence', 'two', 'opposing', 'personalities', 'styles', 'eventually', 'erupt', 'mortal', 'combat', 'strain', 'driving', '9,000', 'head', 'cattle', 'hostile', 'terrain', 'Texas', 'Oklahoma', 'Kansas.As', 'volatile', 'Dunson', 'John', 'Wayne', 'one', 'most', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Living', 'personal', 'code', 'ethics', ""n't"", 'always', 'translate', 'lawful', 'even', 'rational', 'behavior', 'Wayne', 'sympathetic', 'deplorable', 'simply', 'human', 'performance', 'bolstered', 'contrast', 'provided', 'quietly', 'charasmatic', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'unspoken', 'love', 'respect', 'Wayne', 'father', 'figure', 'shine', 'fear', 'intimidation', 'Remarkably', 'was', 'Clift', 'first', 'performance', 'front', 'movie', 'cameras', 'stage-trained', 'actor', 'have', 'adapted', 'instinctively', 'more', 'subtle', 'technique', 'required', 'film', 'work', 'Various', 'other', 'characters', 'come', 'two', 'create', 'memorable', 'triangles', 'film', 'Three-time', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'wonderful', 'Wayne', 'longtime', 'sidekick', 'allegiance', 'eventually', 'Clift', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'minor', 'role', 'character', 'fate', 'conflict', 'two', 'leading', 'men', 'Most', 'fascinating', 'supporting', 'cast', 'John', 'Ireland', 'who', 'curiously-named', 'Cherry', 'Freudian', 'scene', 'Clift', 'admire', 'other', 'pistols', 'then', 'commence', 'shoot', 'off', 'together', 'simply', 'astonishing', 'worth', 'noting', 'Cherry', 'first', 'one', 'try', 'intervene', 'climactic', 'showdown', 'Wayne', 'quot', 'son', 'quot', 'contemptuously', 'quot', 'soft', 'quot', 'equally', 'significant', 'fact', 'character', 'who', 'finally', 'resolution', 'movie', 'quot', 'strong', 'quot', 'woman', 'played', 'Joanne', 'Dru', '.The', 'MGM', 'DVD', 'release', 'classic', 'United', 'Artists', 'film', 'humble', 'opinion', 'abominable', 'source', 'print', 'visually', 'disaster', 'chock', 'full', 'lines', 'jumps', 'flutters', 'speckles', 'other', 'visual', 'noise', 'grays', 'are', 'grainy', 'one', 'point', 'picture', 'even', 'briefly', 'distractingly', 'focus', 'sound', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'pops', 'volume', 'inconsistent', 'Adding', 'insult', 'injury', 'are', 'extras', 'not', 'even', 'cast', 'biographies', 'production', 'notes', 'much', 'less', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'one', 'classic', 'film', 'richly', 'deserves', 'be', 'restored', 'remastered', 'repackaged']",N/A

It is a supperlative western film, telling the story of the first cattle drive from Texas to Abeline, Kansas, which would later be known as the Chisholm Trail.The American West is known for it's rugged individualism, and starring in this epic film is Hollywood's #1 rugged individual, John Wayne.  Wayne plays Tom Dunson, who on a wagon trail of settlers going west, decides to strike out on his own for Texas country and establish his own cattle ranch.  In leaving the wagon train behind, Dunson also leaves behind the love of his young life, saying he will send for her when he finds his homestead.  But that same day, the wagon train is attacked by Indians, and his love is brutally killed.  The only survivor of the massacre is a spirited young boy, who is found wandering in a daze with his cow.  The boy, Matthew Garth, is adopted by Dunson.  The stage is then set for the remainder of the story, the struggle to establish the greatest cattle ranch in Texas, and the massive cattle drive to get the cattle to market.Howard Hawks directs this masterpiece of filmmaking, and takes Borden Chase's (Saturday Evening Post) serialized storyline, and spins a visual saga of obsession and rivalry between Dunson and and his adoptive son Matthew Garth. The film co-stars Montgomery Clift as Matthew Garth.  The cast is very favorably rounded out with the addition of Walter Brennan, Joanne Dru, and John Ireland.  The film's musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin is as perfectly composed for the old west as the black and white rendering of the western barren landscape in the film.It is Dunson's dictatorship resolve to get the cattle to market that eventually leads to the supreme conflict in the film, the battle of wills between father and son.  Matthew Garth is forced by dire circumstances to lead a mutiny against the tyrannical Dunson, and take the herd to Kansas, leaving Dunson alone in the wilderness.  Dunson, stung by the perceived betrayal of his adopted son, promises to catch up with Garth, and kill him.  The film's climax is the showdown between Dunson and Garth, on the streets of Abeline.This is a film that you will enjoy watching for the first time, and for many times afterward.  It is one of Wayne's best films, and the film that established him as a Hollywood western film icon.  John Ford, a close friend of Waynes, and a premier director of his time, commented upon seeing Wayne dominate the film: ""That son of a bitch can really act!""; perhaps the highest form of praise Ford ever gave.If I had to recommend one western film, this is the one I'd choose.",5,Red River is an Epic of Western Filmmaking!,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,2666,"['Let', 'be', 'known', 'one', 'Red', 'River', 'one', 'best', 'Western', 'movies', 'time', 'supperlative', 'western', 'film', 'telling', 'story', 'first', 'cattle', 'drive', 'Texas', 'Abeline', 'Kansas', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'known', 'Chisholm', 'Trail.The', 'American', 'West', 'known', 'rugged', 'individualism', 'starring', 'epic', 'film', 'Hollywood', '1', 'rugged', 'individual', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Wayne', 'Tom', 'Dunson', 'who', 'wagon', 'trail', 'settlers', 'going', 'west', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'Texas', 'country', 'establish', 'own', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'leaving', 'wagon', 'train', 'Dunson', 'also', 'love', 'young', 'life', 'saying', 'will', 'send', 'when', 'homestead', 'same', 'day', 'wagon', 'train', 'attacked', 'Indians', 'love', 'brutally', 'killed', 'only', 'survivor', 'massacre', 'spirited', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'found', 'wandering', 'daze', 'cow', 'boy', 'Matthew', 'Garth', 'adopted', 'Dunson', 'stage', 'then', 'set', 'remainder', 'story', 'struggle', 'establish', 'greatest', 'cattle', 'ranch', 'Texas', 'massive', 'cattle', 'drive', 'get', 'cattle', 'market.Howard', 'Hawks', 'masterpiece', 'filmmaking', 'Borden', 'Chase', 'Saturday', 'Evening', 'Post', 'serialized', 'storyline', 'visual', 'saga', 'obsession', 'rivalry', 'Dunson', 'adoptive', 'son', 'Matthew', 'Garth', 'film', 'co-stars', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Matthew', 'Garth', 'cast', 'very', 'favorably', 'rounded', 'out', 'addition', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'John', 'Ireland', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'Dimitri', 'Tiomkin', 'as', 'perfectly', 'composed', 'old', 'west', 'black', 'white', 'rendering', 'western', 'barren', 'landscape', 'film.It', 'Dunson', 'dictatorship', 'resolve', 'get', 'cattle', 'market', 'eventually', 'supreme', 'conflict', 'film', 'battle', 'wills', 'father', 'son', 'Matthew', 'Garth', 'forced', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'mutiny', 'tyrannical', 'Dunson', 'take', 'herd', 'Kansas', 'leaving', 'Dunson', 'alone', 'wilderness', 'Dunson', 'stung', 'perceived', 'betrayal', 'adopted', 'son', 'catch', 'up', 'Garth', 'kill', 'film', 'climax', 'showdown', 'Dunson', 'Garth', 'streets', 'Abeline.This', 'film', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'times', 'afterward', 'one', 'Wayne', 'best', 'films', 'film', 'established', 'Hollywood', 'western', 'film', 'icon', 'John', 'Ford', 'close', 'friend', 'Waynes', 'premier', 'director', 'time', 'commented', 'seeing', 'Wayne', 'dominate', 'film', 'son', 'bitch', 'can', 'really', 'act', 'perhaps', 'highest', 'form', 'praise', 'Ford', 'ever', 'gave.If', 'had', 'recommend', 'one', 'western', 'film', 'one', ""'d"", 'choose']",N/A

421249,A3K8TYU7UOUTR0,6304429754,M. Dog,"[6, 10]","In the rich history of American film, this piece of work by Howard Hawks makes the short list.  It has been used as a template for any filmmaker wishing to make a Western, and further, it is one of those rare pieces of culture by which a society defines itself. If you needed to demonstrate to a foreigner what the American character is all about, you could show them this movie.As a Western, it certainly has it all: cowboys killing Indians, men leaving women for the call of the trail, gunfights, stampedes, love, betrayal, and finally redemption. It is also gorgeously filmed, beautifully written, and well acted throughout. And finally, it stars John Wayne, an actor that towers over today's crop of male actors like an oak over weeping willows.This film also stars Montgomery Clift as the surrogate son that eventually challenges Wayne for control of the drive. In terms of acting styles, Clift and Wayne were about as different as two actors could be: Wayne seemed always to act on instinct and charisma, while Clift was one of the young Turks through the 40's and 50's, a proponent of a new style of acting - the method developed by Lee Strasburg (one can easily imagine Wayne giving his crooked sarcastic grin over the very idea of a ""school"" where young people learn acting). Yet, casting these two together works. By all reports, the two hated each other at the beginning of the production, but had developed an actor's respect for one another by the end of filming. Wayne, after watching Clift in one of his scenes, was quoted as saying something like ""damn, that little queer sure can act.""John Wayne, for his part, goes toe-to-toe with the new school of internal acting and more than holds his own. His portrayal of a powerful, unbending man who slowly descends into bitterness and hate is a real treat to watch. His performance was, to use a phrase Wayne would have hated, multi-layered and very, very skillful.Other performances to watch: the ever-faithful Walter Brennan, one of the greatest character actors of all time, is perfect as Wayne's partner/friend. It is in watching Brennan's reaction to Wayne's increasing dementia that we see how far off track he's gone. John Ireland also is a standout as Cherry Valance, the pistoleer, who is full of casual grace and menace. As if all the above wasn't enough, the great Harry Carey is onboard briefly as Mr. Melville, radiating authority.Every film lover should own this film and watch it at least once annually.Every American should treasure it as a source of national pride.One note: this is one film that simply demands a better DVD treatment.

421251,A17LEYMZI8OYOQ,6304429754,"Michael B. Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 3]","RED RIVER is one of the great Westerns.  In fact, along with THE SEARCHERS and HIGH NOON, it is one of my all time favorites of the genre.Director Howard Hawks&#8217; classic is an epic tale about the first cattle drive from South Texas to Kansas along the Chisholm Trail.  It stars John Wayne as the hard-minded man determined to bring his nine thousand plus herd to market and Montgomery Clift as his adopted son, who eventually rebels against his overly harsh methods.  Also in the stellar cast are Walter Brennan, John Ireland, Joanne Dru and Coleen Gray, as well as a multitude of familiar faces in secondary roles.There is certainly plenty of action in RED RIVER, which has been tagged by some as &#8220;MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY on a cattle drive,&#8221; but like in that seafaring masterpiece, the primary conflict in this film is between  Wayne&#8217;s &#8220;Captain Bligh&#8221; and Clift&#8217;s &#8220;Fletcher Christian&#8221;.  Indeed, with the possible exception of THE SEARCHERS, Wayne has never been better on screen.The Criterion Collection has released a 2K digital restoration of RED RIVER in an enticing Blu-Ray/DVD 4-disc combo set, containing both the theatrical and the pre-release versions of the movie.  Actually, the difference between the two versions is slight.  In the theatrical  version, there is narration by Walter Brennan and the final confrontation between Wayne and Clift has been altered somewhat.  Frankly, I think that only the most devoted fans of the film would be interested in this earlier version.The set, however is filled with extras.  Not only is there the usual Criterion booklet, containing an essay by film critic Geoffrey O&#8217;Brien and an 1991 interview with film editor Christian Nyby, but there is also a separate book, Borden Chase&#8217;s original novel,  BLAZING GUNS ON THE CHISHOLM TRAIL, which became the basis for the movie.Other extras include an on-camera interview with Peter Bogdanovich about Howard Hawks and RED RIVER, as well as excerpts from a 1972 audio interview Bogdanovich conducted with Hawks.  There are also interviews about Hawks, RED RIVER and the Western genre with film critics and scholars Molly Haskell and Lee Clark Mitchell, excerpts from a 1970 audio interview with screenwriter Borden Chase and a &#8220;Lux Radio Theater&#8221; adaptation of the picture that featured Wayne, Brennan and Dru.

421254,A2QLQJ4G30LT6L,6304429754,MOVIE MAVEN,"[43, 51]","Although there are definitely weaknesses in the screenplay and score for RED RIVER, there is also no question that this film is an American masterpiece.Howard Hawks who directed one of the best comedies Hollywood ever produced, BRINGING UP BABY, took on an almost impossible task:  making an adult Western, basically a cattle drive- inspired remake of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, with over 9,000 head of cattle and the men who, for various reasons, go on the drive from Texas to Kansas.  John Wayne is the boss, Dunson the cattle baron, who becomes obsessed with his mission--getting his cattle sold and onto the railroad.  If there is a &quot;villain&quot; in the movie, Dunson is it and Wayne plays him wonderfully.  The drive, itself, takes over three months and it is grueling:  psychological, as well as physical, problems beset the men.  Wayne's &quot;adopted&quot; son, Matthew, is second in command and it is the relationship between these two men that makes up the heart of the movie and makes the movie as deep and moving as it is.Director Hawks had seen a young actor in a Broadway play and brought him to Hollywood to make his screen debut as &quot;Matthew.&quot;  In this crutial role, Hawks had discovered one of the most under-rated, talented, complicated, handsome actors Hollywood ever saw:  Montgomery Clift.  If Clift had done no film work besides Fred Zinneman's FROM HERE TO ETERNITY and Hawks' RED RIVER, he'd deserve a place in cinema history.Quibbles?  The score by Dmitri Tiomkin could certainly stand to be a bit more subtle; both the creation by the writers and the playing by Joanne Dru of the major female role is completely one dimensional; the last few moments of the movie are as silly as the rest of the two hours+ are fascinating.  So, an altogether thrilling movie, even with a few faults.If for no other reason, all true movie lovers must see the way the stampede is filmed.  The D.V.D. version has no &quot;extras&quot; to speak of, but the print looks beautiful.

421255,ADVBDELE8TP7K,6304429754,Mr. Charles R. Day,"[0, 1]","I wont waste time singing the praises of this film - there are plenty of others to (deservedly) do that. I just wanted to put in a word for the colorised version - it is completely successful - in fact, when my son saw it he had no idea it had not been shot in colour (sorry about the English spelling).I believe there are two areas where colorisation can be not only technically successful, but also artistically ethical - westerns and musicals. If anyone has seen the colorised version of Holiday Inn they will know what I mean - the rewarding results were after much painstaking research (into the dresses etc) and I would never bother to watch the B&W; original included in that set.Nobody would dream of shooting westerns or musicals in B&W; today - and when it was done, I am sure it was not for artistic reasons. A third category that might sometimes be appropriate is war films - I hear The Longest Day has been colorised.I am sorry not to spend any time praising this superb western but I would like to know if the colorised version is available on DVD. There is no doubt that colorisation has now reached a level of sophistication where (apropos my son) if you do not know the film or you can be impartial to the process in principle and judge purely on results, criticism should be muted.The process is obviously inappropriate for film noir and Laurel & Hardy!I would be interested in other people's views - please discuss.",5,Is the colorised version available?,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",2012,1434,"['wont', 'waste', 'time', 'singing', 'praises', 'film', 'are', 'plenty', 'others', 'deservedly', 'do', 'just', 'wanted', 'put', 'word', 'colorised', 'version', 'completely', 'successful', 'fact', 'when', 'son', 'saw', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'shot', 'colour', 'sorry', 'English', 'spelling', '.I', 'believe', 'are', 'two', 'areas', 'where', 'colorisation', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'technically', 'successful', 'also', 'artistically', 'ethical', 'westerns', 'musicals', 'anyone', 'seen', 'colorised', 'version', 'Holiday', 'Inn', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'rewarding', 'results', 'were', 'much', 'painstaking', 'research', 'dresses', 'etc', 'would', 'never', 'bother', 'watch', 'B', 'W', 'original', 'included', 'set.Nobody', 'would', 'dream', 'shooting', 'westerns', 'musicals', 'B', 'W', 'today', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'not', 'artistic', 'reasons', 'third', 'category', 'might', 'sometimes', 'be', 'appropriate', 'war', 'films', 'hear', 'Longest', 'Day', 'been', 'colorised.I', 'am', 'sorry', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'praising', 'superb', 'western', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'colorised', 'version', 'available', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'colorisation', 'now', 'reached', 'level', 'sophistication', 'where', 'apropos', 'son', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'impartial', 'process', 'principle', 'judge', 'purely', 'results', 'criticism', 'should', 'be', 'muted.The', 'process', 'obviously', 'inappropriate', 'film', 'noir', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'other', 'people', 'views', 'please', 'discuss']",N/A
421256,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,6304429754,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[5, 5]","Red River is a western that's surprisingly good, and has its tense and emotional parts that fulfills a gap that a lot of other westerns have.  I was quite pleased with the storyline and how the characters interracted with each other.  The characters as well as script is very believable, and the plot is very inviting even for non-western lovers.John Wayne plays Dunson, a land staker who had a dream on creating his own cattle ranch so he could sell beef.  In other words, he wanted to live the American Dream through cows.  Dunson's character is border line bad guy, as you will see, which is unusual when considering this is the eternal good guy in John Wayne.  But as you might've noticed in past Wayne films, his universal character always seemed to have that dark side suppressed by his will to do good.  Well in this movie, his dark side comes out.  But this is a good thing, it creates conflict and makes the character a bit believable when you see how he became all dark.Montgomery Clift plays Matt Garth, a boy who Dunson adopts and trains.  Garth becomes good with a gun as well as with people and cattle.  Garth is a younger version of what John Wayne's character used to be: good willing, energetic, understanding.These are the primary characters, although Walter Brennan co-stars as well.The movie spends about 15 minutes with a young John Wayne and a younger Walter Brennan, with Clift's character as a boy before the rest of the film takes place I think twenty years later when Wayne is middle aged, Brennan is an old man, and Clift is a grown man.  Although the first 15 minutes were kinda cut and dry with the initial phase of the plot it was effective enough in creating a necessary past for each of the main characters and how they became the way they are.The plot is simple.  Dunson (Wayne) needs to sell his beef, his cattle, but there is no market for beef in Texas.  So Dunson plans on driving his cattle to St. Louis where there is a market.  However during the drive, not all things work out as planned.  Mutiny spreads to the cow hands against Dunson, including those that Dunson trusts the most.  This sudden change in loyalty is outstanding, and so well mastered that it becomes very emotional and very suspenseful to the viewers.  This mutiny works because of the actions of Dunson in different parts of the film.This is a great movie, and it probably deserves five stars, but it is marred because this western makes the classic mistake as most other westerns do: they try and create a love interst.  So the director brings in Joanna Dru's character about two thirds into the film for a romance session with Clift.  This sucked.  The romance is pitiful, it's predictable, it's not necessary and doesn't work for this film.First of all the romance comes in way too late in this film.  Not to mention there's nothing compelling about the romance either, it's the typical love at first sight gimic.  You know what's going to happen when they sit next to one another.  It doesn't take a genius to see that the romance in this film was rushed and it was late.To be frank this isn't a film that needs romance, because it had already survived wonderfully without it for a good 2/3 of the film.  Not to mention, Joanna Dru's character spoils the ending of the film.  What I thought was about to be a colossal ending, a monumental finish to this film turns out to be some pitiful attempt to create comedy.  Big no no in a drama film is to create comedy through romance.  You do not take the fun out of the movie by replacing it with something unnecessary and cheesy.  Again, I'll let you see for yourself.I know I ragged on the romance of this film pretty bad, but I guess I'm growing real tired of romance being thrusted in films that don't need it.  I understand why it's done, but it takes away from the storyline by creating useless sub-plots. In short, Joanna Dru's character costed Red River a star.To be fair, I recommend Red River to all western lovers.

421257,A18SDN3HYFVH2L,6304429754,Muzzlehatch,"[0, 0]","** Some SPOILERS towards the end **There aren't many directors whose films have more consistently improved on second or subsequent viewings for me than Howard Hawks. Five years ago I'm not sure I would have confidently named any of the 15 or so films I've seen to my top films list besides his relatively early screwball comedies BRINGING UP BABY and HIS GIRL FRIDAY; at this point I'm pretty confident in also naming THE BIG SLEEP and RIO BRAVO to the pantheon, and after tonight I can't help but raise the RED RIVER to that level as well. Why is it that Hawks films so often work so much better the second time around? It seems to me that if looked at on the most basic narrative level few of them are all that special, and even the one that stands out in that regard, the almost impossible to follow BIG SLEEP, is memorable more for it's chaos than for anything brilliant that it tells us as a story.No, what we appreciate in Hawks is the camaraderie of the characters, the snappy dialogue which can sometimes slip past us at interesting moments if we aren't listening closely enough, and the sheer joy of living in this grown-up boy's adventure world where women are guys like the rest of us (not so common in Hawks' day, not so common at all) and we can always expect, if not a happy ending then at least a really good time getting to whatever fate awaits us. Hawks films are more about enjoying the journey than following what happens along it I think, and so when we know what's coming up next we can sit back and enjoy the ride a little bit more, because he's not out to surprise or excite us, and we might be disappointed if that's what we're looking for.After ten minutes or so of prologue in which we meet Tom Dunson (John Wayne) and the surrogate son, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift) he rescues from a burning wagon train where he's left the woman who was to become his bride, we're off on a thousand mile adventure to drive 10,000 head of beef from Texas to Missouri. Among those along for the ride are Groot (Walter Brennan), Dunson's old buddy from the pre-Civil War days, and hotshot gunslinger Cherry Valance (John Ireland), Garth's rival in many respects who we might think will come to a bad end eventually. There's also an Indian, Quo (Chief Yowlatchie) who is paired up with Groot when Groot loses his teeth to Quo in a poker game, and a host of other skillfully drawn minor characters, many played by greats among the western character firmament like Hank Worden and Harry Carey Jr.The story is essentially ""Mutiny on the Bounty"", with Dunson increasingly irascible, mean and finally downright vicious and brutal as he drives his men onward to Missouri despite plenty of evidence provided from numerous sources that Abilene Kansas would be a better choice, and despite the growing unease of the men. Finally Garth, his right hand man, has to make a decision when Dunson is determined to hang a couple of ""deserters"" and from this point onwards the climax of the film is obviously no longer going to be the successful fight against the physical hardships, Indian attacks and low morale to get the beef to market, but the battle between experienced, cynical and hard middle age and outgoing, even-tempered youth - between father and son.RED RIVER is a spectacularly impressive production from top to bottom, with terrifically sharp and textured black and white photography by Russell Harlan, impressively staged action sequences including a ""circle the wagons"" scene and a stampede, and a general feel for the grit and hard days of a hundred-day drive; this is a film that really puts you in the moment, plunks you down beside those wide rivers, on those dusty trails. Dmitri Tiomkin's score may mostly be variations on the theme song, ""Settle Down"" but it's absolutely wonderful and joyous regardless and is among my favorite western soundtracks from the period. Hawks' direction is as always stylish and interesting without ever seeming showy; I particularly like his regular long, slow pans across the herd, always communicating the vastness of the undertaking and yet always keeping the men in charge firmly in the forefront, and firmly in command.And those men (and one woman, in the last act) are of course the major reason to watch the film. Wayne's Bligh-like Dunson and Clift's Fletcher Christian-esque Garth are terrific characters in large part because the leisurely pace of the film gives them time to grow and change, gives us the audience a real feel that weeks have passed and that Dunson's growing madness - and Garth's growing sense of authority - aren't just sudden movie plot devices, but real changes in personality brought into place through real conditions. The rest of the characters revolve around the two principals and here is an area where Hawks' genius really comes into play. Ireland's excellent portrayal of Cherry Valance would probably still have been memorable if he'd been allowed to be just a conventional rival to Garth, but he doesn't go that route, instead becoming in a sense the replacement for Garth when Garth replaces Dunson; and when Groot decides he's had enough of Dunson too, it's a bit of a surprise - usually the old-timer guy stays with the hard and uncompromising protaganist. But Hawks makes Dunson enough of a bastard - and gives Garth enough genuine space to mature - that we accept the situation, and it helps to make the final resolution relatively uncertain.Or is it uncertain? In the last half hour we have a woman, Tess Millay (Joanne Dru) rescued from the wagon train by Garth who inserts herself into the story and into their relationship. Some critics and viewers find the ending of the film stupid or unbelievable or weak in part because I suppose they don't like Tess coming in and changing the dynamics - in essence, healing the rift between ""father"" and ""son"" by offering herself as a builder of further generations, a link to the future that Dunson has dreamed and talked about through the whole movie. And so the ending - after a pre-climax shootout that is admittedly a bit problematic - is jokey, romantic, repaired friendships, and platonic masculine love. There is no bad guy at the end, not really; we get a fistfight to settle just a bit of our desire for that cathartic violence, but that's all we need. If the Western is ultimately all about the future, and not the past, why does it always need to end in a killing?  Though I certainly can understand the argument that the WAY the ending is handled is too silly, I also think that those who insist on a more conventional finish there are guilty of a failure of imagination; I think blaming Hawks or his screenwriters Borden Chase and Charles Schnee for trying something different is missing the point.  I say, long live the unconventional, in this most hidebound of genres.",5,THE cattle drive film.,1286409600,"10 7, 2010",2010,6818,"['**', 'SPOILERS', 'towards', 'end', 'are', ""n't"", 'many',

421262,AGK4BEIQ017HY,6304429754,P. I. Johnson,"[14, 15]","The greatest cattle drive ever filmed! Director Howard Hawks (Rio Bravo, El Dorado) cements his lifelong association with star John Wayne in this gripping Western adventure with more than a slight hint of Mutiny on the Bounty. Wayne stars as a grizzled rancher out to save his business in the early days of Texas. To do so he has to embark on an epic drive to get his cattle to market. Together with his adopted son Marty (Montgomery Clift), he enlists a team of cattle drivers to aid him in a final, desperate drive West. As time and nature bear down, his obsession begins to drive his men to breaking point - with Marty increasingly in the middle of the growing conflict that ensues between the crusty leader and his disgruntled men. With mutiny in the air, it is finally up to father and son to face each other with some hard truths - and force a confrontation that will test the bonds of family and loyalty. Both Wayne and Clift are on top form, their contrasting personas and acting styles very much at the heart of the electricity between them whenever they share a scene. Clift's thoughtful coolness has impressively survived the passage of time and he accordingly makes for a sympathetic protagonist - struggling to strike out from beyond the giant shadow of a larger-than-life adoptive father whose original kindness begins to pale in the face of the increasing of his obsessive drive to market. Affectionately referenced in the comedy City Slickers, Red River remains a worthy epitome of the old school traditional Western, unencumbered by the darkness, cynicism and irony that would begin to influence the genre in the 50's and 60's through the works of Fred Zinneman, Anthony Mann, Sergio Leone, Arthur Penn and, most interestingly, old school cowboy auteur John Ford as well (The Searchers; Cheyenne Autumn).",5,Classic western that still delivers!,990230400,"05 19, 2001",2001,1821,"['greatest', 'cattle', 'drive', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'El', 'Dorado', 'lifelong', 'association', 'star', 'John', 'Wayne', 'gripping', 'Western', 'adventure', 'more', 'slight', 'hint', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'Wayne', 'grizzled', 'rancher', 'save', 'business', 'early', 'days', 'Texas', 'do', 'so', 'embark', 'epic', 'drive', 'get', 'cattle', 'market', 'Together', 'adopted', 'son', 'Marty', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'team', 'cattle', 'drivers', 'aid', 'final', 'desperate', 'drive', 'West', 'time', 'nature', 'bear', 'down', 'obsession', 'drive', 'men', 'breaking', 'point', 'Marty', 'increasingly', 'middle', 'growing', 'conflict', 'crusty', 'leader', 'disgruntled', 'men', 'mutiny', 'air', 'finally', 'up', 'father', 'son', 'face', 'other', 'hard', 'truths', 'force', 'confrontation', 'will', 'test', 'bonds', 'family', 'loyalty', 'Wayne', 'Clift', 'are', 'top', 'form', 'contrasting', 'personas', 'acting', 'styles', 'very', 'much', 'heart', 'electricity', 'whenever', 'share', 'scene', 'Clift', 'thoughtful', 'coolness', 'impressively', 'survived', 'passage', 'time', 'accordingly', 'sympathetic', 'protagonist', 'struggling', 'strike', 'out', 'giant', 'shadow', 'larger-than-life', 'adoptive', 'father', 'original', 'kindness', 'pale', 'face', 'increasing', 'obsessive', 'drive', 'market', 'Affectionately', 'referenced', 'comedy', 'City', 'Slickers', 'Red', 'River', 'worthy', 'epitome', 'old', 'school', 'traditional', 'Western', 'unencumbered', 'darkness', 'cynicism', 'irony', 'would', 'begin', 'influence', 'genre', '50', '60', 'works', 'Fred', 'Zinneman', 'Anthony', 'Mann', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'Arthur', 'Penn', 'most', 'interestingly', 'old', 'school', 'cowboy', 'auteur', 'John', 'Ford', 'as', 'well', 'Searchers', 'Cheyenne', 'Autumn']",N/A

My grandma and father thoroughly enjoyed scaring me with their list of horror films. My mom tortured me with her melodramatic TV dramas and foreign films. But it was my grandpa who introduced me to his enduring love for the Western. He would painstakingly record his favorite Western films on his Sony Beta Max video recorder from the television networks and local tv stations, patiently pausing and unpausing in order to remove all the commercials. Then he would invite my brother and I over for a Sunday afternoon of popcorn and old Westerns. We loved going over to &#8220;gramps&#8221; house and marveling at the adventures of John Wayne, Charles Bronson, and Clint Eastwood. Grandpa's selections were not always critically acclaimed, but they were his favorites and they sure had an impact on me. While my interest in various genres have shifted over the years, my love of the Western has remained and in fact intensified as I matured as a film viewer. Which is why I was so excited to get my hands on the Blu-ray release of one of grandpa's favorite Westerns, Howard Hawks' &#8220;Red River&#8221; presented by the Criterion Collection, released on May 27, 2014.I won't go over all of the story or technical details since they have been covered by other reviewers on Amazon and by Dr. Svet Atanasov on Blu-ray.com. But I will discuss what I feel are the high points of this release for me personally. The first and biggest high point is the inclusion of a restored 127 minute Theatrical Release version. For years the only version I ever saw was the 133 minute Prerelease version which played on television broadcasts and was eventually released on VHS and DVD. And while I enjoyed the Prerelease version, I was always curious about the lost Theatrical Release version that apparently director Howard Hawks had preferred.The story of how Criterion assembled and restored the Theatrical cut is impressive on it's own and is detailed on page 27 of the included insert booklet. To summarize, the professionals at Criterion used a damaged 35mm print from MGM's archives as a reference guide to piece the theatrical cut back together using the clean footage from the Prerelease cut combined with a 35mm composite print from the Cinematheque Francaise for the missing sequences. The many hours of work and technical achievement that went into this restoration is well worth the high price of this Criterion release for fans of Red River and those who appreciate classic films and Westerns in general. I was in awe and excited listening to the pleasant voice narration of Walter Brennan who played Nadine Groot throughout the film while never before seen optical sequences played out during the narrated scene transitions. The result is a more intimate feel to the story along with a tighter editing job and a shortened ending which in my opinion resulted in a better film. While some critics, like Molly Haskell, who is interviewed for this blu-ray release, preferred the longer Prerelease version, I think the beauty is that both fully restored versions are included in this set for you to decide which cut meets your personal preference.The second big high point for me is one that was touched on briefly in the blu-ray.com review, and that is the beautiful packaging and goodies included in this set which includes 2 DVDs, 2 Blu-rays, an insert booklet and a paperback copy of the novel, Blazing Guns on the Chisholm Trail by Borden Chase for which &#8220;Red River&#8221; is based on. The slipcase is a high quality cardboard and is beautifully illustrated in sepia-like colors of browns and tans with red and orange fonts for the title and the director's and actor's names. The front cover depicts the climatic face off between John Wayne and Montgomery Clift at the ending of the film. I absolutely love the packaging. It is artistic, classic and full of western film flavor. Each disc has a unique photograph of different characters and scenes in the film and is packaged in plastic holders between bookend photos of Wayne and Clift. The included illustrated booklet has a striking red cover and features a fascinating article by critic Geoffrey O'Brien and an interesting interview with editor Christian Nyby. Rounding out this incredible package is a paperback copy of the novel in which the film is based on by Borden Chase. The book is of surprisingly good quality with decent size font.All of this makes for a wonderful high quality Blu-ray release by the passionate film lovers and restorers at the Criterion Collection. I fully recommend this release for all lovers of classic film, and especially fans of Westerns and &#8220;Red River&#8221;.

But could we compared it to Ford's splendidly filmed ""Wagon Master""? John Ford maintains his shooting eye at a certain distance while Howard Hawks keeps it nearby... But both are skilled directors of a bunch of great movies...Ford is closer to Western movies, and Hawks to other genre... Ford treats his Western characters as people behave... Hawks displays it in vivid adventure... In ""Red River,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" and ""The Big Sky"" Howard Hawks is far from the magnitude of Ford's ""The Searchers."" Under Ford's instruction, John Wayne is fluent and moderate, refined in conduct and manners as in ""The Quiet Man."" With Hawks, Wayne's character prevails differential tendency toward passion and fury...It is soon evident that the cattle boss is tough to the point of obsession... It could be argued that only men of this spirit could have handled and survived the first pioneering cattle drives... One of the drovers (John Ireland) wants to make for Abilene but gets no change out of Wayne... When the cattle stampede Wayne goes to 'gun-whip' one of the hands, Clift intervenes... It was then evident that Wayne was going to drive his men just as hard as he intends to drive the cattle...""Red River"" is a Western just as much concerned with human relationships and their tensions as with spectacle and action--a hallmark of Hawks' films and this element is introduced when the pair meet up with a boy leading a cow... The boy confirms the wagon-train massacre, and the boy and the cow from then on are included in the partnership... This is not only a key-point of the narrative but also a highly symbolic moment...For some years Garfield was the only screen rebel... But in Clift's appearance in ""Red River,"" another rebel was born... In ""Red River,"" Clift plays the adopted son who opposes his father's domineering attitudes and behavior towards himself and also towards the cowhands who work for them on the drive to market... The struggle between father and adopted son, compels delighted interest... Dunson's unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us Captain Bligh in ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" In the beginning of the film we had admiration for Wayne's persona... We concluded finding him unfriendly, unconscious, unacceptable and faulty... Clift wins our sympathy!Clift was the withdrawn, introverted man who quietly maintains his integrity as he resists all pressures... These qualities were summed up in the words of Private Prewitt in ""From Here to Eternity"" probably Clift's finest rebel role!""Red River"" will remain a film with a unique flavor... It has, and will continue to have, its own special niche among honored Westerns...With two Academy Award Nomination for Writing, splendid music score by Dmitri Tomkin and excellent acting including the supporting cast, the film had all the concepts of Howard Hawks' quality: vigor in action, reality as opposed to emotions and a faculty of scale...",5,"A film which is spectacle at its best , although spectacle is by no means all of it...",1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,3156,"['1939', '1948', 'two', 'major', 'Westerns', 'done', 'taste', 'skill', 'eye', 'beauty', 'could', 'be', 'mentioned', 'John', 'Ford', 'Stagecoach', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'Red', 'River', 'Red', 'River', 'great', 'adventure', 'Western', 'considered', 'very', 'best', 'Westerns', 'could', 'compared', 'Ford', 'splendidly', 'filmed', 'Wagon', 'Master', 'John', 'Ford', 'shooting', 'eye', 'certain', 'distance', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'nearby', 'are', 'skilled', 'directors', 'bunch', 'great', 'movies', 'Ford', 'closer', 'Western', 'movies', 'Hawks', 'other', 'genre', 'Ford', 'Western', 'characters', 'people', 'behave', 'Hawks', 'vivid', 'adventure', 'Red', 'River', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Big', 'Sky', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'far', 'magnitude', 'Ford', 'Searchers', 'Ford', 'instruction', 'John', 'Wayne', 'fluent', 'moderate', 'refined', 'conduct', 'manners', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Hawks', 'Wayne', 'character', 'differential', 'tendency', 'passion', 'fury', 'soon', 'evident', 'cattle', 'boss', 'tough', 'point', 'obsession', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'only', 'men', 'spirit', 'could', 'have', 'handled', 'survived', 'first', 'pioneering', 'cattle', 'drives', 'One', 'drovers', 'John', 'Ireland', 'make', 'Abilene', 'change', 'Wayne', 'When', 'cattle', 'stampede', 'Wayne', ""'gun-whip"", 'one', 'hands', 'Clift', 'intervenes', 'was', 'then', 'evident', 'Wayne', 'was', 'going', 'drive', 'men', 'just', 'as', 'hard', 'drive', 'cattle', 'Red', 'River', 'Western', 'just', 'much', 'concerned', 'human', 'relationships', 'tensions', 'spectacle', 'action', 'hallmark', 'Hawks', 'films', 'element', 'introduced', 'when', 'pair', 'up', 'boy', 'leading', 'cow', 'boy', 'wagon-train', 'massacre', 'boy', 'cow', 'then', 'are', 'included', 'partnership', 'not', 'only', 'key-point', 'narrative', 'also', 'highly', 'symbolic', 'moment', 'years', 'Garfield', 'was', 'only', 'screen', 'rebel', 'Clift', 'appearance', 'Red', 'River', 'rebel', 'was', 'born', 'Red', 'River', 'Clift', 'adopted', 'son', 'who', 'father', 'domineering', 'attitudes', 'behavior', 'towards', 'also', 'cowhands', 'who', 'work', 'drive', 'market', 'struggle', 'father', 'adopted', 'son', 'compels', 'delighted', 'interest', 'Dunson', 'unfeeling', 'hardhearted', 'style', 'remembers', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'Mutiny', 'Bounty', 'beginning', 'film', 'had', 'admiration', 'Wayne', 'persona', 'concluded', 'finding', 'unfriendly', 'unconscious', 'unacceptable', 'faulty', 'Clift', 'sympathy', 'Clift', 'was', 'withdrawn', 'introverted', 'man', 'who', 'quietly', 'integrity', 'pressures', 'qualities', 'were', 'summed', 'up', 'words', 'Private', 'Prewitt', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'probably', 'Clift', 'finest', 'rebel', 'role', 'Red', 'River', 'will', 'remain', 'film', 'unique', 'flavor', 'will', 'continue', 'have', 'own', 'special', 'niche', 'honored', 'Westerns', 'two', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'Writing', 'splendid', 'music', 'score', 'Dmitri', 'Tomkin', 'excellent', 'acting', 'including', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'had', 'concepts', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'quality', 'vigor', 'action', 'reality', 'opposed', 'emotions', 'faculty', 'scale']",N/A

421266,A1BRXLFWILNICE,6304429754,Robin McDonald,"[4, 5]","I remember watching Fatal attraction. It was one of the most fascinating stories of obsession I had ever seen. At the end Glenn Close was dead. Her eyes glazed over white and a fitting end had come to a near perfect character. Suddenly she popped out the tub screaming and flailing away with a butcher knife in the fashion of a B-movie horror flick! It was fun but it significantly cheapened everything that was set up before it. I am comparing apples to pineapples but Red River is a little like that. John Wayne's character Tom Dunson is one most memorable movie characters of all time. He is focused, driven and hell bent to deliver his cattle to Missouri. In a masterful point in the film Dunson is separated from the drive and off screen for an extended period. Still his prescence is threatening &amp; pervasive. A dozen men from his own drive fear his return. The tension build and builds. Finally the moment arrives and the inevitable fight ensues. Then suddenly something happens so out of left field you will have to witness it for yourself. Several endings were shot but like Fatal Attraction, Red River plugs in an ending that doesn't really fit but hopes to appeal to the masses. Fortunately this happens as the last 90 seconds of what is one of the most intense and exciting westerns ever filmed. I don't mean to focus on this one sour note because Red River should not be missed. This ending is such a blunder it almost spoiled the movie for me and its just a forewarning to cushion the shock to the unaware. Read some of the other reviews here to get a feel for the greatness of this film. You will find very few films that break the four and a half star average rating barrier on Amazon.

421269,A3PKQVWH1GTQCF,6304429754,"R. W. Knotts ""Tracker9""","[6, 29]","This movie is about a rancher who decides to make a cattle drive to Missouri to sell his cattle.  He says he is going to take 10,000 head.  Take is the operative word for he ""takes"" every cow in the area, including many that don't belong to him.  What makes matters worse is that he changes the brands to look like they belong to him. In other words he is a cattle rustler.  The other ranchers catch him doing this and instead of him being arrested and hanged as any other Rustler would have been, the owners of the cows give them his blessing and let him ""steal"" their cows. That just isn't the type of roll any true John Wayne lover can stomach. He also takes these 10,000 head of cattle and starts the drive with what appears to be about 10 cowhands. Now come on, it would take a hundred cowhands to control that many cattle!  Not to mention how many he kills along the way for insubordination.  He tells them that no one has ever successfully crossed the Red River, that everyone who tried was ambushed, but he is going to do it with 10,000 cows and 10 cowboys?Overall I was very disappointed with this movie. It started out pretty well and then as the movie dragged on, it got boring and shallow. I can only say, it was by far one of the worst John Wayne westerns I have ever seen. Wayne's character is portrayed as a mentally ill cattleman whose trailriders mutiny against.  He is mean-spirited and shallow and when the young man Wayne raised as his own son tries to convince him that Kansas City is a far better & closer choice as a cattle market, he refuses to listen to reason, wanting to continue on to Missouri. When his ""adopted son"" takes over the drive, Wayne tells him that he is going to kill him when he catches up with him.At the end a small line is displayed saying this  cattle drive started the Chisholm Trail.  There was never any mention of this anywhere in the movie and never is it portrayed as a true story.

421275,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6304429754,Simon Davis,"[5, 6]","For those that always believe that John Wayne can only ever play ""John Wayne"", on screen, a viewing of Howard Hawks's truly great 1948 western classic ""Red River"", is absolutely essential. Never has the Duke delivered a more controlled and subtle performance than in this magnificent movie which I had the great pleasure of screening only for the first time recently. John Wayne's lengthy film career is of course littered with many memorable films however this one is varies often from the usual Wayne formula in showing a flawed man who is often wrong but who has enough gumption to realise his faults and change matters. Teaming up here with the sensational new comer Montgomery Clift in his much heralded film debut ""Red River"", has a unique theme in depicting very poignantly the real bond, growing affection, and indeed love that develops between men living on the great frontier and how both obtain their inner strengths and qualities from the example of the other. The up and down relationship between the characters played by Wayne and Clift is the chief catalyst for most of the drama and action in this fascinating story and both men, the rugged older John Wayne with his eighteen years of movie work behind him, and the more gentile younger Montgomery Clift fresh from his New York acting training combine surprisingly well. I truly is a classic story of men's attempts to hold onto what they value and to improve their lives no matter what the cost. It's these two performances so perfectly etched and non sentimentalised that have made ""Red River"", rightly one of the most respected westerns to be produced in Hollywood's Golden Age.Based on a Saturday Evening Post story titled ""The Chisholm Trail"", ""Red River"", stars John Wayne as rancher Tom Dunstan who along with ever faithful side kick Groot Nadine (Walter Brennan), decides to branch out on his own from the wagon train he is travelling with to open up his own stretch of land. Leaving his lady love Fen (Coleen Gray), behind until he is settled she and the rest of the Wagon Train team are massacred by Indians with the exception of a young boy Matt Garth (Mickey Kuhn/Montgomery), who teams up with the two men and settles on some undeveloped land to begin cattle grazing. Matt becomes like a son to Tom and as the years progress Tom gradually builds up a thriving cattle ranch. However times change and when the price of cattle falls dramatically and Tom's income dries up he decides to take all his stock on a cattle drive to where the markets are better. The long drive along the dangerous Chisholm Trail however proves to be an endurance test for everyone as thirst, natural disasters, and eventually even mutiny threaten to destroy Tom's livelihood. Determined to protect his hard earned livelihood Tom begins to become more and more aggressive and dictatorial towards the men as the drive continues and when an unfortunate mistake by one member of the team costs the life of another Tom decides to punish the man with a whipping. The men object and even Matt now stands up to him and takes over command of the men. Together with backup from cowboys Cherry Valance (John Ireland), and Buster McGee (Noah Beery Jr),Matt takes on responsibility for the herd he has to now get to the market. Tom swears revenge on Matt and heads off to gather a new group of men who will help him reclaim his herd. Meanwhile Matt continues on with the drive and despite being fearful of Tom's revenge manages to find time along the way to romance fiesty Tess Millay (Joanne Dru), a woman who he saves when another wagon train is attacked by Indians. Continuing on to the market Matt barely has time to celebrate getting almost all of the herd safely through and getting a good price for them when a show down occurs with Tom who has caught up with the cattle drive and vows to kill Matt. However when the final confrontation occurs between the two men Tom realises that by killing Matt he would in reality be killing part of himself and the two put aside their differences to resume the life they enjoyed together previously as de facto father and son. The conclusion also sees Matt now also set to wed Tess who through her quick thinking was able to make both stubbborn men realise how much they actually loved each other before it was too late.Despite their very different acting backgrounds and approaches to their work John Wayne and Montgomery Clift have a magnetic chemistry in ""Red River"", and since this is a very human story about the conflict between two men who deep down have great affection for each other this chemistry makes this story even more compelling than it ordinarily would have been. Howard Hawk's direction here is also first rate and he shows a real understanding of the bonds that grow up between men that aren't often expressed in words but instead in actions. Hawks was responsible for giving Clift his break in the star making role of Matt and he never looke dback in Holywood after this role. Veteran character actor and three time Oscar winner Walter Brennan as the crusty old salt of the earth ""Groot', also thrives under the sure directing hand of Howard Hawks becoming almost the moral conscience to John Wayne's character. He also enjoys an equally special chemistry with the two lead actors creating something of a trinity at the centre of the story. The supporting cast contains many interesting performances both large and small with the up and coming John Ireland as ""Cherry"" Valance, who is part nemesis and part attraction for Matt , and Noah Beery Jr who most would probably still remember from his long running role on ""The Rochford Files"", with James Garner as Buster McGee, being the standouts. ""Red River"", contains many other features that make it a standout classic western from the interesting idea of showing the diary pages with highlighted paragraphs leading the audience into the next piece of action, through to Russell Harlan's absolutely spellbinding exterior photography along the Chisholm Trail. The legendary Dimitri Tiomkin also supplies another one of his rousing musical scores that were so well suited to the western and swashbuckler genres.Many complaints are usually centred on the quite sudden and unexpected conclusion to the story when Tom and Matt reconcile at the big shootout but somehow this finish based on raw emotion and a realisation of just what they feel for each other despite their differences is totally appropriate. ""Red River"", contains a sprawling story filled with spectacular scenery, wagon train attacks, shoot outs and romance and has truly earned its place in the annuals of Hollywood as one of the greatest westerns ever produced. To see John Wayne at his absolute peak in a role that really makes demands on him is reason enough to see ""Red River"", however it should be in the collection of every person who loves great stories set in America's old West.

It's a simple tale of a cattle drive, a cruel, driven man (John Wayne), and his sensitive adopted son (Montgomery Clift). Clift is maybe the only actor I've seen -- except for James Stewart -- who can command by his performance equality in a scene with Wayne.  I thought he was superb. The supporting cast is similarly good: Walter Brennan as comic relief and moral arbiter sets the standard for the type.  The ending, however, would have been better had a female character, Joanne Dru, never have been introduced.  This is a story about men; let them work out their problems in their own way.Wayne, in a reversal of usual Hollywood practice, plays a man older than himself in this movie.  He was about 40 when ""Red River"" was released, but his character in the movie is probably closer to fifty.  This is probably the first time he played a tough old man, but he went on to play about the same role dozens of times.The virtues of the movie, in addition to the cast of Wayne/Clift/Brennan, is the black and white photography. A scene which terrified me when I saw this movie as a small child is when Wayne takes on the Comanches at night in the river near the beginning of the movie; Then, there is the justly-famous scene when Wayne strides angrily toward a showdown with Clift and the cattle herd parts for him like the Red Sea did for Moses.

His adopted son Matt (Montgomery Cliff) returns from the Civil war to assist his father on the ranch. Due to post-war economic conditions, ranchers in Texas are unable to sell cattle locally. Dunston determines to drive 10,000 head of cattle to Missouri one thousand miles away. The trials and tribulations of the cattle drive, as well as the intricacies of the relationship between father and son are the primary focus of the movie.The crux of their relationship is the re-establishment of hierarchy as Matt becomes an adult male who questions his father's overly violent solutions to problems.  Montgomery Cliff is a very interesting actor who performs beautifully and sensually in his role as a cowboy--however playing a cowboy is probably not the best role for him.  John Wayne plays his usual role--a sympathetically bluff and bullying man who doesn't listen to others.  In addition, the selective moral compass of this character is troubling--he steals cattle and land, as well as killing people who get in his way.  This is disturbing in a movie that has been lauded as a great western portraying the western spirit.Red River is filmed in beautful, deeply contrasted black-and-white.  The music is unfortunate--western soundtrack music at its worst.  The mood of the music rarely matches the action.

421279,A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM,6304429754,Stanley Crowe,"[2, 2]","In this movie shot in 1946, John Wayne convincingly gives us a study in obsession -- he plays Tom Dunston, a man determined to run a 1000-mile cattle drive his way, and he becomes a tyrant in doing so, pushing his men beyond their limits and being unwilling to consider any alternatives. He's Captain Bligh on the range, and the Fletcher Christian character, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift), is his adopted son, whom he loves and who in turn admires him. When Garth seizes control of the drive (to stop Dunston from summarily hanging two men who have ""deserted"" the drive because of Dunston's obsessive ways), Dunston vows to track him down and kill him.There is some great footage of the cattle drive, 9,000 head on what would become the Chisholm Trail from Texas to Abilene, and it catches the sheer work of a cattle drive in all weathers, with problems of stampedes and marauding Comanches. Howard Hawkes's achievement here is to show us the minutiae of such a trek, while keeping just enough emphasis on the human dimensions of the plot, and doing so for two hours without being boring. I had just seen Wayne in ""El Dorado,"" easing along with Robert Mitchum. Here is a much more distinctive character, an implacable force whose obsession becomes truly frightening and is credibly put in the context of economic necessity, bitterly hard work, and sheer fatigue. Very early in the movie, though, as Dunston simply takes over a stretch of land in Texas -- and defends it with the gun when necessary for fourteen years -- we see the hints of the implacability to come. It's a fine performance by an actor too often credited with only playing himself.Clift is effective as the less-driven Garth, a younger man, who doesn't lose perspective. Between the first scenes and the cattle drive, fourteen years pass, and we're to understand that Garth has spent some of these years in the Civil War. Interestingly, the war is only a temporal marker. Substantively, it's as if it never happened -- an odd case of avoidance that was a factor too in ""El Dorado, in which we're to understand that Wayne's and Mitchum's characters were veterans of that conflict -- but it doesn't seem to have done anything in either film except make the characters handy with their guns.The ending is a serious weakness -- in Abilene, Dunston catches up to Garth and the herd and tries to goad Garth into a gunfight. Garth won't draw, and it all ends in fisticuffs, rather reminiscent of (or foreshadowing, rather) Wayne's punch-up with Victor McGlaglen in ""The Quiet Man."" The Maureen O'Hara figure in ""Red River"" is Joanne Dru, who breaks up the fight and tells the men that they really love one another. Dunston seems to come to his senses -- why not much earlier, when Dru makes the same point to him when she meets him in pursuit of Garth? -- and they look sheepish, a bad thing for cattlemen (sorry!). Maybe it took the Oedipally-inflected violence to purge the obsession (interestingly, earlier, Dru offers to bear Dunston's child if he will give up on revenge, though since she had slept with Garth a few nights earlier, one might wonder whose child it was). Anyway -- it's a too-easy and sentimental ending for a movie that has been about more serious matters. Still worth seeing, though, and the cattle are spectacular in many scenes.",4,"4.5 stars -- good story, weak ending",1393632000,"03 1, 2014",2014,3312,"['movie', 'shot', '1946', 'John', 'Wayne', 'convincingly', 'study', 'obsession', 'Tom', 'Dunston', 'man', 'determined', 'run', '1000-mile', 'cattle', 'drive', 'way', 'tyrant', 'doing', 'so', 'pushing', 'men', 'limits', 'being', 'unwilling', 'consider', 'alternatives', 'Captain', 'Bligh', 'range', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'character', 'Matt', 'Garth', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'adopted', 'son', 'whom', 'who', 'turn', 'When', 'Garth', 'control', 'drive', 'stop', 'Dunston', 'summarily', 'hanging', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'deserted', 'drive', 'Dunston', 'obsessive', 'ways', 'Dunston', 'track', 'down', 'kill', 'great', 'footage', 'cattle', 'drive', '9,000', 'head', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'Chisholm', 'Trail', 'Texas', 'Abilene', 'sheer', 'work', 'cattle', 'drive', 'weathers', 'problems', 'stampedes', 'marauding', 'Comanches', 'Howard', 'Hawkes', 'achievement', 'here', 'show', 'minutiae', 'such', 'trek', 'keeping', 'just', 'enough', 'emphasis', 'human', 'dimensions', 'plot', 'doing', 'so', 'two', 'hours', 'being', 'boring', 'had', 'just', 'seen', 'Wayne', 'El', 'Dorado', 'easing', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Here', 'much', 'more', 'distinctive', 'character', 'implacable', 'force', 'obsession', 'truly', 'frightening', 'credibly', 'put', 'context', 'economic', 'necessity', 'bitterly', 'hard', 'work', 'sheer', 'fatigue', 'Very', 'early', 'movie', 'though', 'Dunston', 'simply', 'over', 'stretch', 'land', 'Texas', 'gun', 'when', 'necessary', 'fourteen', 'years', 'see', 'hints', 'implacability', 'come', 'fine', 'performance', 'actor', 'too', 'often', 'credited', 'only', 'playing', 'himself.Clift', 'effective', 'less-driven', 'Garth', 'younger', 'man', 'who', ""n't"", 'lose', 'perspective', 'first', 'scenes', 'cattle', 'drive', 'fourteen', 'years', 'pass', ""'re"", 'understand', 'Garth', 'spent', 'years', 'Civil', 'War', 'Interestingly', 'war', 'only', 'temporal', 'marker', 'Substantively', 'never', 'happened', 'odd', 'case', 'avoidance', 'was', 'factor', 'too', 'El', 'Dorado', ""'re"", 'understand', 'Wayne', 'Mitchum', 'characters', 'were', 'veterans', 'conflict', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'anything', 'film', 'make', 'characters', 'handy', 'guns.The', 'ending', 'serious', 'weakness', 'Abilene', 'Dunston', 'up', 'Garth', 'herd', 'tries', 'goad', 'Garth', 'gunfight', 'Garth', 'wo', ""n't"", 'draw', 'fisticuffs', 'rather', 'reminiscent', 'foreshadowing', 'rather', 'Wayne', 'punch-up', 'Victor', 'McGlaglen', 'Quiet', 'Man', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'figure', 'Red', 'River', 'Joanne', 'Dru', 'who', 'up', 'fight', 'men', 'really', 'love', 'one', 'Dunston', 'come', 'senses', 'why', 'not', 'much', 'earlier', 'when', 'Dru', 'same', 'point', 'when', 'pursuit', 'Garth', 'look', 'sheepish', 'bad', 'thing', 'cattlemen', 'sorry', 'took', 'Oedipally-inflected', 'violence', 'purge', 'obsession', 'interestingly', 'earlier', 'Dru', 'bear', 'Dunston', 'child', 'will', 'give', 'up', 'revenge', 'had', 'slept', 'Garth', 'few', 'nights', 'earlier', 'one', 'might', 'wonder', 'child', 'was', 'Anyway', 'too-easy', 'sentimental', 'ending', 'movie', 'been', 'more', 'serious', 'matters', 'Still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'cattle', 'are', 'spectacular', 'many', 'scenes']",N/A

421281,AK61LQI92GTCH,6304429754,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[10, 10]","Howard Hawks' 1948 RED RIVER is an ambitious, sprawling, epic western.  It's on a number of top-100 lists, and it belongs there.The movie tells the story of cattle rancher Tom Dunson and the first drive along the fabled Chisholm Trail.  It's based on Borden Chase's ""The Chisholm Trail""The movie hits the ground running.  Within the first five minutes there's a romantic leave taking, an indian attack and a burning wagon train.  The romantic parting of Dunson (John Wayne) and his intended is a key incident in the development of this bitter and hard-driven character.  Dunson and Groot Nadine (Walter Brennan), who left the wagon train with Dunson, are joined by a survivor of the massacre, Matt Garth - who, fourteen years later, will become the quick-drawing Montgomery Clift.  The shocked boy is leading a cow, Dunson and Groot have a surviving bull, and with this bovine first couple they make for the open land south of the Red River.Fast forward 14 years and Dunson has 10,000 head of cattle and a depressed, post-Civil War southern economy that can't afford to buy them.  They must drive them to Missouri and sell them to the more prosperous northerners or face ruin.  During that drive Dunson descends to near insanity and Matt ascends as a moderating influence and, apparently, becomes the only one who can successfully lead the men and cattle to market.  Without giving too much away, something happens on the drive that will drastically change Dunson's and Matt's relationship and jeopardize both of their lives.It's pretty heavy stuff, and John Wayne is rock solid great as the troubled Dunson.  This is one of the greatest roles in the career of a sometimes under-rated actor.  Montgomery Clift is fine in his screen debut.Walter Brennan's Groot is a marvel.  That guy was such a good actor.  Like all good sidekicks, and Brennan was the best, Groot is part court jester and part moral barometer.  It helps that he plays most of the movie without his upper teeth in, too.  Brennan was always better when his mouth was half empty.There are some images that will stick with you for a while.  Thousands of cattle crossing the Red River, a midnight stampede with a couple of hair-raising rescues.  And there's a neat little bit with an angry John Wayne striding down a long street crowded with cattle - Wayne doesn't break stride, of course, and the cattle move out of his way like a longhorn Red Sea parting for an angry Moses.For the most part the script is well written, and there's enough amusing scenes (usually including Brennan) to keep the whole thing from collapsing under it's own weight.For instance, when Dunson and Matt are deciding who's to go along on the drive, Dunson excludes Groot (bum leg.)  Groot mutters to himself like a live-action Popeye while Dunson and Matt continue their conversation.  A distracted and exasperated Dunson finally says:Dunson: What are you saying?  I can't understand you. Where's your store teeth Matt bought you?Groot: They're in my pocket.Dunson: Well, why don't you use them?Groot: `Cause they whistle.  I use them for eating.Then there's the Joanne Dru character, Tess Millay.  It doesn't help that her first appearance occurs in the third scene.  One hour and forty-one minutes into the 2:20 movie, by my clock.  My guess is the scriptwriters didn't want to clutter up the action with a romantic subplot until absolutely necessary.  Fair enough, but it means that Millay's and Matt's romance has to be telescoped severely.  Basically they meet, fall in love, and part in a day.  It stretches an audience some.  Worse, Dru as an actress simply wasn't right for the part.One of her character traits, as written, is to talk and keep on talking when something worries or frightens her.  She does this to negligible effect.  It's a role that seemed to have been custom written for Jean Arthur, who always could blabber on to good effect, who could always drop her voice down to a husky purr or have it emit an abrupt squeak for maximum dramatic effect.  Unfortunately Arthur was nearly fifty when this movie was made, so I guess casting her as a romantic lead opposite the young Clift would have, uh, added an strange and unwelcome dimension to the movie.  Dru, in one of her earliest roles, just doesn't have the chops to carry off the role convincingly.  All things considered, I think this piece of miscasting is more Hawks' fault that anyone elses.  Anyway, I shaved a point off because of it.I don't normally notice bad transfers, but there are a few dark night scenes in RED RIVER that look like someone lit a Fourth of July sparkler.  And, less forgivable, my new factory-sealed-from-a-reputable-national-outlet retailer did NOT contain the advertised four page booklet.  Finally, I've played the movie twice so far, and each time the start up menu screen doesn't appear until AFTER the movie is over.",4,Mutiny on the plains,1082678400,"04 23, 2004",2004,4865,"['Howard',

421282,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,6304429754,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[9, 10]","John Wayne has played variations on his tough-guy persona throughout the years. From the noble tough-guy in Stagecoach (1939) to the senstivie tough-guy in The Quiet Man (1952), Wayne has displayed enough different sides of his persona to keep his performances from being considered carbon copies of each other. In Howard Hawks' Red River (1948), we are privy to the uncompromising, masculine-to-the-max 100% all-man John Wayne. Wayne plays Tom Dunson (Wayne), a driven man who sets out West in 1851 and winds up in Texas with the goal of starting a cattle ranch. His only companion is Groot Nadine (Walter Brennan) but soon after an Indian raid destroys Dunson's former wagon train group, Dunson takes in the lone survivor of the raid - a young boy named Matt Garth. Years past and Garth (played as an adult by Montgomery Clift) is poised to become the heir to Dunson's cattle ranch. However, tempers flare when Dunson and Garth must embark on a historic cattle drive to take 9,000 head of cattle to Missouri. Both men have a falling out over where the cattle should be delivered, the men want to take them to Abilene, but Dunson stubbornly wants to continue with the more difficult trek to Missouri. A revolt breaks out and soon Dunson is banished from his own cattle drive. As a pure Western, Red River is a glorious gem within the genre. Yet, the film bogs down a little when Tess Millay (Joanne Dru) enters the picture. The story arc that involves her courting by both Dunson and Garth comes across as awkward. The energy produced by the cattle drive arc just aren't there in the romantic triangle arc. Yet, the film is still a wonder to behold because of Wayne's bravura, archetype performance.

Montgomery Clift (in his screen debut), Walter Brennan as their devoted sidekick, and Joanne Dru (in a wonderful performance)round out the sterling cast that is given all it needs from a great script by Borden Chase and instinctive, stellar direction from Howard Hawks.Gunfights, family disputes, the natural tension that develops between an aging but proud father and a young but capable son yearning to prove himself are all themes played out large for the viewer. Wayne, with gray hair, plays a meaner, older character than usual. Clift demonstrates the promise that would eventually see him considered one of his generations greatest actors. Brennan plays much older than his years as usual, having set the cinematic standard for crotchety curmudgeons that stick with you through thick and thin. And Dru simply puts Wayne in his place like no other, except perhaps for Maureen O'Hara.

In 1851, Tom Dunson rides into south Texas with plans of starting a cattle ranch.  Fourteen years later in 1865 after the Civil War, Dunson has his cattle ranch, but he is broke since no one is willing to buy his cattle.  Dunson decides to drive 9,000 head of cattle to Missouri at all costs.  On the trail, he becomes a tyrant, obsessed only with getting the cattle to market.  His tyranical behavior begins to wear on his men causing his right hand man, Matt Garth, to take over the herd.  This is an excellent western from director/producer Howard Hawkes.  They just do not make them like this anymore.  Huge cast, great musical score from Dimitri Tiomkin, exciting action, and well-developed characters makes Red River one of my favorite John Wayne westerns.Similar to his performance in John Ford's The Searchers, John Wayne plays a character against type as Tom Dunson, the dedicated yet cruel cattle baron who will get his herd to market at all costs.  Montgomery Clift matches Wayne step for step as Matt Garth, Dunson's adopted son and right hand man on the drive.  Joanne Dru plays the obligatory love interest, Tess Millay, who Matt falls in love with on the trail.  The always great Walter Brennan plays Groot Nadine, Dunson's close friend.

421291,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,6304429754,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[1, 2]","Producer & director Howard Hawks set the bar so high that not even he could surpass himself when he helmed his first and greatest western, ""Red River,"" with John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. Hawks bought Borden Chase's serialized ""Saturday Evening Post"" story ""The Chisholm Trail"" about the first big historic cattle drive between Texas and Kansas and turned it into this sprawling, spellbinding horse opera. The closest any of Hawks' contemporaries ever came to matching his masterpiece was Raoul Walsh's ""The Tall Men"" (1955) with Clark Gable, Jane Russell, and Robert Ryan. More than any other Hawks' movie, ""Red River"" qualifies as the director's purest expression of physical action on a grand scale with more than 9000 steers filling the frame. This epic western dealt not only with Manifest Destiny as one of its multiple themes but also the creation of the great western cattle empires that would mass produce beef for national consumption. At the same time, Hawks' film depicts the trials and tribulations that occurred after the Civil War in Texas. An autocratic cattle baron struggles to maintain his authority against well-nigh impossible odds. Treacherous white desperadoes plundered herds and cattlemen confronted these brigands as well as bloodthirsty Native Americans. Nothing like ""Red River"" had been attempted, even by legendary western director, John Ford, who had chronicled the development of the railroad in his silent classic ""The Iron Horse."" Indeed, James Cruze's ""The Covered Wagon"" (1923) and later Walsh's ""The Big Trail"" (1930) showed the physical hardships that the pioneers encountered on wagon trains crossing the vast untamed west. On the other hand, nobody had made a movie about herding cattle. This monumental cattle drive served as the larger-than-life background story to the foreground story about a penniless ranch baron, Tom Dunson, (John Wayne) and his adopted son, Matthew Garth (Montgomery Cliff), who built one of the biggest cattle ranches in Texas. Eventually, Raoul Walsh made ""The Tall Men"" (1955), with Clark Gable, Jane Russell, and Robert Ryan, the second greatest western about cattle driving.""Red River"" opens in 1851 with a wagon train crossing the plains when ex-soldier Tom Dunson (John Wayne) and his friend Nadine Groot (Walter Brennan) leave the safety of the procession and venture off south. The wagon train boss warns Dunson about hostile Indians in the vicinity. Ironically, the Indians massacre the train and Dunson's amour (Coleen Gray) who he refused to take with him because he couldn't ensure her safety. Dunson and Groot survive an Indian attack. As they are about to resume their journey, a teenager leading a cow, who survived the Indian attack, wanders into their camp. The orphaned Matthew Garth (Montgomery Cliff) grows up to become Dunson's adopted son. Fifteen years later, Dunson presides over 9-thousand cattle, but he is as broke as Texas. Dunson decides to drive the herd to market in Missouri. Dunson quarrels with Matt over the best route, and Matt rebels against Dunson's overbearing rules. At gunpoint, Garth relieves Dunson of the herd and drives it to Kansas instead of Missouri. Along the way, our heroes help out a wagon train besieged by Indians. Matt meets Tess Millay (Joanne Dru) who falls in love with him. A vengeful Dunson, who has vowed to kill him, trails Matt until they confront each other in Abilene and challenges him to duel. During this showdown, Matt refuses to shoot Dunson. Dunson and Garth beat each other to a pulp until Tess intervenes and forces them to shake hands.""Red River"" proved something of a departure for John Wayne. Wayne had confined himself to roles roughly corresponding to his actual age. In ""Red River,"" however, Tom Dunson ages some 14 years, a feat that the actor had never been called on to portray. Wayne goes from being a fit, fast-drawing, dark-haired hero to a tyrannical, gray-haired individual who cannot draw his six-gun as swiftly and suffers from the infirmity of his increased longevity. John Ford, who gave Wayne his first important role in ""Stagecoach,"" saw ""Red River"" and told Hawks that Wayne's portrayal of an older man captivated him. Subsequently, Ford cast Wayne as a retiring cavalry commander in his own classic western ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon."" Actually, ""Red River"" is a seminal Wayne feature because in many of his later oaters, particularly ""The Train Robbers,"" his colleagues always refer to him as stubborn, bull-headed, and Tom Dunson established that character for Wayne. Hawks said that he considered making ""Red River"" in color but elected to use black & white to give the film a period look. Montgomery Cliff surprised Howard Hawks when he managed to hold his own against his renowned co-star. Next to ""From Here to Eternity,"" ""Red River"" is one of Clift's best performances and he looks comfortable in his cowboy outfit. The scene between Clift and Ireland where they swap six-guns and keep a tin can flying through the air is outstanding. Of course, Walter Brennan steals the movie with the running gag about his teeth. Early in the action, he loses his teeth to a Cherokee Indian when he is playing for table stakes in a poker game and cannot borrow money. Consequently, he stakes his teeth, but loses the game. The Cherokee lets the Brennan character eat with them, but he demands that he return them between meals. The Brennan character complains because his teeth helped keep the dust out of his mouth. Noah Beery, Jr., is very good as Buster and the man who taught John Wayne his distinctive walk--Paul Fix of ""The Rifleman"" TV show--is perfect as one of the drovers who rebels against Dunson.A lawsuit between Howard Hughes and Hawks arose over a simple line of dialogue from an earlier movie, ""The Outlaw,"" that Hawks had worked on with Hawks postponed the release of ""Red River"" from 1946 to 1948.",5,Classic John Wayne Western About Cattle Drives,1268784000,"03 17, 2010",2010,5870,"['Producer', 'director', 'Howard', 'Hawks', 'set', 'bar', 'so', 'high', 'not', 'even', 'could',

Like Hannibal leading elephants over the Alps, John Wayne leads his massive army of cattle through the impassible terrain, through the mountains, valleys and rivers.  His character, Thomas Dunson, is the usual Western stereotype of a hard, uncompromising man with a will of iron.The surprises, and the true quality of ""Red River,"" is when the story strays from its cliche and into the uncharted territory of the human soul.  Standard issue masculine values, such as duty, loyalty and strength are on display, but not always resolved in an expected manner.  John Wayne plays an excellent anti-hero, and Montgomery Clift is the perfect heir-apparent.The weakness of ""Red River"" lies in its Western cliche, of which there are many, and in its unnecessary foreshadowing of events.  A better director might have allowed the story to unfold without telling the audience exactly what was going to happen 3 moves in advance.Not a classic along the lines of ""High Noon,"" ""The Searchers"" or ""Unforgiven,"" but still a standout Western for any fan of the genre.
