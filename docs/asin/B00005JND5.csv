629244,ARHUBLVXF8PGF,B00005JND5,Aaa,"[1, 4]","1. Ray Charles was a once-in-a-lifetime talent.2. Jamie Foxx does a great imitation of Ray Charles.3. ""Ray"" is entertaining, but mostly superficial and sometimes silly.I wanted to love this movie, but except for the incredible soundtrack and Foxx's eerie Ray-ness, ""Ray"" might as well have been a Sunday night network bio-drama. And for all his world-class mimicry, Foxx fails to give life to Charles. Mostly, though, that's the screenplay's fault and not Foxx's. (Check out Tom Hulce's Mozart in the Milos Forman/Peter Shaffer film of ""Amadeus"" if you want to feel the pain and glory of musical genius.)The overall feel of ""Ray"" calls to mind nothing so much as ABC's sixties retrospective family show, American Dreams. Not surprisingly, my kids really enjoyed ""Ray""; it's easy on the eyes, and there's a comfortable TV-ness about it. Even when Charles is cheating on his wife or shooting up, it's all fairly upbeat; there's a subliminal happy-ending sub-text in just about every frame, and ultimate redemption is pretty much baked into the script. When Charles' demons (and there are plenty) do pop up, they get whack-a-moled well before they can spoil your hand-clappin' fun. And in ""Ray"", blindness isn't just something to overcome; it's almost cool. Drugs, of course, aren't cool, even when they help the artist flower, and the movie's anti-drug message is clear. If you've got kids in the 11 to 15 range, ""Ray"" probably provides as good a reason to just say no as they're likely to get from any of those preachy school programs. The ceiling shots of Foxx squirming through night sweats almost made me want to give up Lipitor. Once Ray breaks the habit, of course, the good times roll yet again.Parental caveat: you may have a tough time explaining that Ray Charles probably didn't compose ""Hit The Road, Jack"" aloud and on the fly as he was throwing his lover out the door.",3,Great Television Movie,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1879,"['1', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'once-in-a-lifetime', 'talent.2', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'great', 'imitation', 'Ray', 'Charles.3', 'Ray', 'entertaining', 'mostly', 'superficial', 'sometimes', 'silly.I', 'wanted', 'love', 'movie', 'incredible', 'soundtrack', 'Foxx', 'eerie', 'Ray-ness', 'Ray', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'Sunday', 'night', 'network', 'bio-drama', 'world-class', 'mimicry', 'Foxx', 'give', 'life', 'Charles', 'Mostly', 'though', 'screenplay', 'fault', 'not', 'Foxx', 'Check', 'out', 'Tom', 'Hulce', 'Mozart', 'Milos', 'Forman/Peter', 'Shaffer', 'film', 'Amadeus', 'want', 'feel', 'pain', 'glory', 'musical', 'genius', 'overall', 'feel', 'Ray', 'mind', 'nothing', 'so', 'much', 'ABC', 'sixties', 'retrospective', 'family', 'show', 'American', 'Dreams', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'kids', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Ray', 'easy', 'eyes', 'comfortable', 'TV-ness', 'Even', 'when', 'Charles', 'cheating', 'wife', 'shooting', 'up', 'fairly', 'upbeat', 'subliminal', 'happy-ending', 'sub-text', 'just', 'frame', 'ultimate', 'redemption', 'pretty', 'much', 'baked', 'script', 'When', 'Charles', 'demons', 'are', 'plenty', 'do', 'pop', 'up', 'get', 'whack-a-moled', 'well', 'can', 'spoil', 'hand-clappin', 'fun', 'Ray', 'blindness', ""n't"", 'just', 'something', 'overcome', 'almost', 'cool', 'Drugs', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'cool', 'even', 'when', 'help', 'artist', 'flower', 'movie', 'anti-drug', 'message', 'clear', ""'ve"", 'got', 'kids', '11', '15', 'range', 'Ray', 'probably', 'as', 'good', 'reason', 'just', 'say', 'no', ""'re"", 'likely', 'get', 'preachy', 'school', 'programs', 'ceiling', 'shots', 'Foxx', 'squirming', 'night', 'sweats', 'almost', 'made', 'want', 'give', 'up', 'Lipitor', 'Once', 'Ray', 'habit', 'course', 'good', 'times', 'roll', 'yet', 'again.Parental', 'caveat', 'may', 'have', 'tough', 'time', 'explaining', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'compose', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'aloud', 'fly', 'was', 'throwing', 'lover', 'door']",Ray
629245,A2AJUX70GIZWKV,B00005JND5,"A. A Slezak ""Incredulous Reader""","[0, 1]","I'll have to say I was pretty impressed by this movie.  I did not know Ray Charles story or even that his real last name was Robinson.  I was impressed with Jamie Fox's acumen in his portrayal of Ray Charles.  I thought at many times throughout the move that I was watching Ray Charles.Even though he was a blind man he had many did facets in his life and the way that he lead it.  Throughout the story the movie flashes back to the days when he was a young child and could see.  The movie uses the flashback to give the reasons why he acts the way he does.Everybody tried to take advantage of him from the money that he was paid having to get his pay in singles, the women who took advantage of him because of his talent especially that woman in the beginning in Seattle.  But once he was moving up he changed all that and became a very shrewd businessman.  He was the first to own his master recordings and got to write the music that he wanted in every category.The movie showed his dual life; his use of heroin and his many women on the road with the dichotomy of his wife and his professionalism on stage.  He was able to keep it together but would not tolerate abuse from anyone else in his band.  He was trying to reach a level of excellence that no one else could achieve.It took me a long time to realize who the executive from Atlantic records was or where I had seen him before.  I knew I recognized him but could not place him.  He played a great character role.The reason I did not give this a higher rating was the DVD features are atrocious.  I started by watching the extended version of the DVD.  It goes along then it breaks in the middle of dialog sometimes and after the third time it became really annoying, I thought there was something wrong with my DVD.  In one part it begins repeating the same scene for take after take and you will think your DVD is stuck.  If you watch the extended version and then the deleted scenes you have already seen them.  It was very disappointing that there was nothing new in the deleted scenes.So overall I thought it was a good movie but maybe you should wait for the next version of the DVD and maybe they will fix these problems.",3,Bad DVD Good Movie,1121385600,"07 15, 2005",2005,2189,"[""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'story', 'even', 'real', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'Robinson', 'was', 'impressed', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'acumen', 'portrayal', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'thought', 'many', 'times', 'move', 'was', 'watching', 'Ray', 'Charles.Even', 'was', 'blind', 'man', 'had', 'many', 'did', 'facets', 'life', 'way', 'lead', 'story', 'movie', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'child', 'could', 'see', 'movie', 'flashback', 'give', 'reasons', 'why', 'way', 'tried', 'take', 'advantage', 'money', 'was', 'paid', 'having', 'get', 'pay', 'singles', 'women', 'who', 'took', 'advantage', 'talent', 'especially', 'woman', 'beginning', 'Seattle', 'once', 'was', 'moving', 'up', 'changed', 'became', 'very', 'shrewd', 'businessman', 'was', 'first', 'own', 'master', 'recordings', 'got', 'write', 'music', 'wanted', 'category.The', 'movie', 'showed', 'dual', 'life', 'use', 'heroin', 'many', 'women', 'road', 'dichotomy', 'wife', 'professionalism', 'stage', 'was', 'able', 'keep', 'together', 'would', 'not', 'tolerate', 'abuse', 'anyone', 'else', 'band', 'was', 'trying', 'reach', 'level', 'excellence', 'one', 'else', 'could', 'achieve.It', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'realize', 'who', 'executive', 'Atlantic', 'records', 'was', 'where', 'had', 'seen', 'knew', 'recognized', 'could', 'not', 'place', 'played', 'great', 'character', 'role.The', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'higher', 'rating', 'was', 'DVD', 'features', 'are', 'atrocious', 'started', 'watching', 'extended', 'version', 'DVD', 'along', 'then', 'middle', 'dialog', 'sometimes', 'third', 'time', 'became', 'really', 'annoying', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'DVD', 'one', 'part', 'repeating', 'same', 'scene', 'take', 'take', 'will', 'think', 'DVD', 'stuck', 'watch', 'extended', 'version', 'then', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'deleted', 'scenes.So', 'overall', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'maybe', 'should', 'wait', 'next', 'version', 'DVD', 'maybe', 'will', 'fix', 'problems']",Ray

No sugar coating of the lows and an excellent job of sharing the highs. It's a fine, fine movie. It focused on the early years, before rehab, and probably simplified some things to fit into only 2.5 hours. So, not perfect. But very good. Well worth watching.Possibly the funniest moment is this.

629248,ANYRXHDVOVS17,B00005JND5,A. Customer,"[3, 4]","What can I say about this film that has not already been said?  Very little.  I agree with everyone who says that Jamie Foxx ""became"" Ray Charles.  I ""became"" Ray Charles just watching it.  It was an amazing performance.  At the end of it, I felt as though I knew Ray--I felt that he was one of my friends--I felt that I miss him now that he is gone.  The performance was that powerful.  I agree with everyone who says that the sets were dynamite.  The cars.  The clothes.  The hip-cat talk.  The brash Jim Crow.  They took us back, baby.  They took us back.  I agree with everyone who says that the music works in this movie better than in any musician's bio-pic ever, and that includes even the best of them like Buddy Holly, The Doors, Richy Valens, Sweet Dreams, Coal Miner's Daughter, the Countless Elvis attempts, and even the Oscar-winning Amadeus.  And there is a reason: focus.Love it or hate it, focus makes the difference.  Yes, Ray's life was bigger than addiction, adultery, and adoration. Yes, this narrowness of focus leaves out much that is to be said about one of the musical greats of all time.  It does, however, make for an easier viewing.  It does allow for a man's life to be built around plotpoints, rather than feel like a confusing splash of film images--which is what usually happens in a bio-pic (take Van Peeble's ALI, for example).So, if we focus on Ray's adultery, there is a natural beginning, middle and end when Marge Hendricks, his longtime lover, meets Ray, becomes entangled in his life and his music, and then dies tragically of an overdose (never mind the truth that Ray's dalliances neither began nor ended with Marge).If we focus on the drugs, there is a natural beginning, middle and end when Ray is introduced to heroin, becomes a junky, and finally kicks the habit (never mind that the addiction seems to have coincided with the BEST music he ever created; in other words, most of the songs we love him for were all created during his junky days).Finally, if we focus on the adoration (i.e., the music and the fan), we get the ""rhyme"" that matches the ""reason.""  In other words, Ray's music, fueled by his addiction and lust, is the perfect background music for . . . the movie RAY.  The driving rhythms of HIT THE ROAD JACK and UNCHAIN MY HEART are both heartstrong and drugged-out frenetic.A final point: My second favorite Ray song of all time is THE NIGHTTIME IS THE RIGHT TIME (my all time favorite was left out of the film, LET'S GO GET STONED).  For about two decades I have associated that song, NIGHTTIME, with a classic episode of THE COSBY SHOW--you know the one I'm talking about: Cosby and family lip-sync a musical tribute to their grandparents before they go off on a sea voyage to renew their vows.  It is a sweet scene, highlighted by cute little Rudy (Keisha Knight Pulliam), five at the time, closing her eyes in a lover's mask and moaning the song's famous call ""Baby, Baaaabay, Babbbbay, Ooh my ba-baaaay"" to Cosby's reponse, ""I say Baby, I say Baby--"" Again, I know that you know the scene and the song--it begins with Dave ""Fathead"" Newman's famous lazy bump-and grind tenor sax intro.  For years when I heard the song, the Cosby scene played in my head.  That little girl belting out those words.  It seemed so cute.  So innocent.  Seeing it in the movie, with Marge Hendricks singing it to her lover Ray Charles,  seeing the look of love and lust in her eyes, seeing her eyes wide open as she sings--there is nothing cute about that scene.  Baby don't mean baby in that scene, if you know what I mean.",5,"Addiction, Adultery, and Adoration",1108771200,"02 19, 2005",2005,3569,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'Very', 'little', 'agree', 'everyone', 'who', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'became', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'became', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'just', 'watching', 'was', 'amazing', 'performance', 'end', 'felt', 'knew', 'Ray', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'friends', 'felt', 'miss', 'now', 'gone', 'performance', 'was', 'powerful', 'agree', 'everyone', 'who', 'sets', 'were', 'dynamite', 'cars', 'clothes', 'hip-cat', 'talk', 'brash', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'took', 'back', 'baby', 'took', 'back', 'agree', 'everyone', 'who', 'music', 'movie', 'better', 'musician', 'bio-pic', 'ever', 'even', 'best', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Doors', 'Richy', 'Valens', 'Sweet', 'Dreams', 'Coal', 'Miner', 'Daughter', 'Countless', 'Elvis', 'attempts', 'even', 'Oscar-winning', 'Amadeus', 'reason', 'focus.Love', 'hate', 'difference', 'Yes', 'Ray', 'life', 'was', 'bigger', 'addiction', 'adultery', 'adoration', 'Yes', 'narrowness', 'focus', 'out', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'one', 'musical', 'greats', 'time', 'however', 'make', 'easier', 'viewing', 'allow', 'man', 'life', 'be', 'built', 'plotpoints', 'rather', 'feel', 'confusing', 'splash', 'film', 'images', 'what', 'usually', 'bio-pic', 'take', 'Van', 'Peeble', 'ALI', 'example', '.So', 'focus', 'Ray', 'adultery', 'natural', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'when', 'Marge', 'Hendricks', 'longtime', 'lover', 'meets', 'Ray', 'entangled', 'life', 'music', 'then', 'tragically', 'overdose', 'never', 'mind', 'truth', 'Ray', 'dalliances', 'began', 'ended', 'Marge', '.If', 'focus', 'drugs', 'natural', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'when', 'Ray', 'introduced', 'heroin', 'junky', 'finally', 'habit', 'never', 'mind', 'addiction', 'have', 'coincided', 'BEST', 'music', 'ever', 'created', 'other', 'words', 'most', 'songs', 'love', 'were', 'created', 'junky', 'days', '.Finally', 'focus', 'adoration', 'i.e.', 'music', 'fan', 'get', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'other', 'words', 'Ray', 'music', 'fueled', 'addiction', 'lust', 'perfect', 'background', 'music', 'movie', 'RAY', 'driving', 'rhythms', 'HIT', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'JACK', 'UNCHAIN', 'MY', 'HEART', 'are', 'heartstrong', 'drugged-out', 'frenetic.A', 'final', 'point', 'second', 'favorite', 'Ray', 'song', 'time', 'NIGHTTIME', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'TIME', 'time', 'favorite', 'was', 'left', 'film', 'LET', 'GO', 'GET', 'STONED', 'two', 'decades', 'have', 'associated', 'song', 'NIGHTTIME', 'classic', 'episode', 'THE', 'COSBY', 'SHOW', 'know', 'one', ""'m"", 'talking', 'Cosby', 'family', 'lip-sync', 'musical', 'tribute', 'grandparents', 'go', 'off', 'sea', 'voyage', 'renew', 'vows', 'sweet', 'scene', 'highlighted', 'cute', 'little', 'Rudy', 'Keisha', 'Knight', 'Pulliam', 'five', 'time', 'closing', 'eyes', 'lover', 'mask', 'moaning', 'song', 'famous', 'call', 'Baby', 'Baaaabay', 'Babbbbay', 'Ooh', 'ba-baaaay', 'Cosby', 'reponse', 'say', 'Baby', 'say', 'Baby', 'Again', 'know', 'know', 'scene', 'song', 'Dave', 'Fathead', 'Newman', 'famous', 'lazy', 'bump-and', 'grind', 'tenor', 'sax', 'intro', 'years', 'when', 'heard', 'song', 'Cosby', 'scene', 'played', 'head', 'little', 'girl', 'belting', 'out', 'words', 'seemed', 'so', 'cute', 'So', 'innocent', 'Seeing', 'movie', 'Marge', 'Hendricks', 'singing', 'lover', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'seeing', 'look', 'love', 'lust', 'eyes', 'seeing', 'eyes', 'wide', 'open', 'nothing', 'cute', 'scene', 'Baby', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'baby', 'scene', 'know', 'what', 'mean']",Ray

629253,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00005JND5,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[6, 6]","The fabulous music, and a performance by Jamie Foxx that captures the essence of the complex character that was Ray Charles, override the flaws that may be found in this film. Ray's roots were in the abject poverty of his youth in Greenville, Florida, where he witnessed the drowning of his younger brother, and shortly afterward started to go blind at the age of 5. Many of the events from his childhood are told in flashbacks, and there is a magical scene where he learns to use his ears to replace his eyes, as his mother watches in silence. His life on the road, his many women, and his battle with heroin addiction are depicted, but it's the music that drove his life. Ray was a musical genius who also had an astute instinct for business, and for what songs to add to his repertoire, which often broke new ground and went against the advice of the record industry experts.Every bit of praise and every award (including the Best Actor Oscar) for Jamie Foxx is justified. Though the soundtrack uses the original recordings dating as far back as the 1953 ""Mess Around,"" Foxx is obviously an accomplished pianist; the actor and his role are like a marriage made in heaven, and this film biography will surely become a classic. The others in the cast that surround him are excellent, with Sharon Warren as his mother, Regina King as Margie Hendricks, and Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun among the standouts.Director Taylor Hackwood blends the flashbacks and nightmares from the past into the thread of the story in a cohesive manner, and one is never lost in the sequences, as can easily happen with that style of storytelling. The flaws in the film would be in some of the stereotypical characterizations, but they fade into the background quickly as the power of Ray the genius and Jamie the actor rivet out attention to the screen.

When you see a young mother crying because her young little son is losing his vision, you immediately feel sympathy...even though you know that Ray Charles was blind.  As the movie progresses, you actually start to believe you are looking at Ray Charles.  That is because Jamie Foxx gives the performance of his life. His mannerisms, voice, and even the way he plays the piano (which he acutally does in the movie) are perfect impersinations.  The movie takes you through most of Mr. Charles big life events, and surprisingly, the director does a good job of being honest.  Ray's less flattering life choices (drugs, etc) are dealt with as much as his triumphs.  The whole fiem does very well in giving the viewer a great idea of what his life was like.  Ths movie was both happy and sad, but very moving at all times.

That's because, whenever somebody stumbles over a format that works, everyone else keeps doing it over and over, milking it down to the last cent.The recent swell of bio-pics like Walk The Line and Capote can be traced in part to the immense and deserved popularity of Ray. The version I saw included extended ""director's cut"" scenes which could be viewed on demand. They are highly recommended. These scenes add depth and texture to personal demons that plagued Charles. Overall the movie is remarkably accurate and fair, and provides great insight into a larger than life genius and musical innovator.Ray's portrayal of the early days is particularly interesting, tiny clubs, being paid in ones, the splendid independence and confidence, so much the product of his mother's insistence he be prepared for blindness when it arrived. That the movie stops before wretched musical excesses of the late career is an all-around blessing. But here is the problem.Foxx did deserve the Oscar, especially for the way he recreated movement, mannerisms, and physical style. He made a newly dead Charles return to life in our minds. But was the Academy rewarding Foxx, or Charles? Ray Charles was a universally loved icon. All Foxx had to do was slip into his suit and immediately he became interesting, sympathetic, and talented - because he was Ray Charles. By achieving his re-creation goal so completely, Foxx drew attention away from the movie's failure, a complete lack of originality.The creative process involves delivering something that wasn't there before you arrived. The triumph of Ray, as good as it is, is that it delivers something that was already there, the personal and musical legacy of Ray Charles, and doesn't injure it too badly in the process. That Hollywood today relies so heavily on breathing life into recently deceased celebrities for its financial grist succinctly demonstrates its creative bankruptcy and cannibalistic tendencies.",5,Dough Ray Me Too,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2037,"['said', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'place', 'where', 'truly', 'believe', 'practice', 'perfect', 'because', 'whenever', 'somebody', 'format', 'everyone', 'else', 'doing', 'milking', 'down', 'last', 'cent.The', 'recent', 'swell', 'bio-pics', 'Walk', 'Line', 'Capote', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'part', 'immense', 'deserved', 'popularity', 'Ray', 'version', 'saw', 'included', 'extended', 'director', 'cut', 'scenes', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'demand', 'are', 'highly', 'recommended', 'scenes', 'add', 'depth', 'texture', 'personal', 'demons', 'plagued', 'Charles', 'Overall', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'accurate', 'fair', 'great', 'insight', 'larger', 'life', 'genius', 'musical', 'innovator.Ray', 'portrayal', 'early', 'days', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'tiny', 'clubs', 'being', 'paid', 'ones', 'splendid', 'independence', 'confidence', 'so', 'much', 'product', 'mother', 'insistence', 'be', 'prepared', 'blindness', 'when', 'arrived', 'movie', 'wretched', 'musical', 'excesses', 'late', 'career', 'all-around', 'blessing', 'here', 'problem.Foxx', 'did', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'especially', 'way', 'recreated', 'movement', 'mannerisms', 'physical', 'style', 'made', 'newly', 'dead', 'Charles', 'return', 'life', 'minds', 'was', 'Academy', 'rewarding', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'universally', 'loved', 'icon', 'Foxx', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'slip', 'suit', 'immediately', 'became', 'interesting', 'sympathetic', 'talented', 'was', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'achieving', 're-creation', 'goal', 'so', 'completely', 'Foxx', 'drew', 'attention', 'away', 'movie', 'failure', 'complete', 'lack', 'originality.The', 'creative', 'process', 'delivering', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'arrived', 'triumph', 'Ray', 'as', 'good', 'something', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'personal', 'musical', 'legacy', 'Ray', 'Charles', ""n't"", 'injure', 'too', 'badly', 'process', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'relies', 'so', 'heavily', 'breathing', 'life', 'recently', 'deceased', 'celebrities', 'financial', 'grist', 'succinctly', 'creative', 'bankruptcy', 'cannibalistic', 'tendencies']",Ray

HE'S SO FRIGGIN' AWESOME!!These reviewers weren't too far from the truth. The movie probably won't stand the test of time, but it's one I'm glad I saw. I definitely felt its best picture nomination was uncalled for, especially since more worthy movies such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind were ignored.I got bored about a third of the way through it, and decided to go take a shower, while my family continued watching it. When I was finished and came back to resume viewing, I followed the story perfectly. This proves one thing: It was very, very long and it had too many extraneous parts. A good film, in my definition, will grip you until the very end where the emotion hits you like a cement wall. Shall I bring up the example again of Eternal Sunshine? THAT'S a good movie, if I should say so myself!Buuuuuuut, no one can deny the fact that Jamie Foxx was superb in the role. He very much deserved that Oscar he received.

629259,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B00005JND5,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[3, 5]","It's interesting to know that Ray Charles himself had a great deal of input into the movies content before his death in 2004, as well as selecting the recordings (some old, some newly adapted).I've long been a fan of Ray's music, but knew very little about the man, and herein discovered the many sides to his character. A devoutly religious man, he was also a heroin addict who suffered with habitual infidelity, and many a bad decision along his road to fame and fortune. Many have noted the connection between his drug addiction and his lyrical talents, but the movie delves deeper into how Music was not only his salvation, but also a shield and an extension of his inner self that helped him try to overcome his blindness. Being a black man in racially segregated 1948 America, and coming from very humble beginnings in Florida would have been hard enough; but carrying the disability of no sight also from aged 7 leaves one hardly being able to imagine the difficulties he overcame. The movie centers on the 50's and 60's predominantly, and the period detail and recreation are excellent, as is the supporting cast. Another review has mentioned how you forget that you are watching an actor, such is the strength of Foxx's portrayal, and that in itself is a mammoth task when dealing with any biopic, let alone a musical icon of Charles stature. Well deserving of the Oscar for best actor, Foxx undoubtedly carries the film. The music is great, and the selections chosen for the movie mirror perfectly the era shown before you. I highly recommend this movie, not only to those who enjoy Ray's music, but to anyone with a love of great drama, and an interest in one of the great entertainers this country has produced. The  DVD  is also packed with extra's that I didn't have time to view (as I had only borrowed the copy I viewed) and the sound and picture quality are excellent, especially when used through a surround or auxiliary speaker set up.

629261,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JND5,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","A lot of love circulates around Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance here, and yes he did do a wonderful imitation of the real thing, but to me `Ray' has a lot more deserving areas to give consideration and appreciation.  For one, the set designs are brilliant, the lighting and mood of just about every scene is fantastic and the musical numbers, while all actual recordings, are choreographed in such a way that you could swear Foxx did all his own singing.  Case in point, there is a scene where Ray is singing in a club and in the recording some of the first words out of his mouth are mumbled and so to make it authentic Jamie knocks the microphone off balance for a moment.  It's the little touches like that one that make this movie authentic, accurate and worth while.I did enjoy Foxx, so don't get me wrong, but I did feel that his work in `Collateral' was more deserving of the praise.  The main problem I have with Foxx's performance is that he invests so much time and energy into getting Ray down that he forgets to infuse enough of himself into the performance to make Jamie the actor stand out aside from Ray the character.  But, with that little jab of criticism I will admit that he's a force on screen and demands you pay attention.That said, to me the real star of this film is the man behind the camera, Taylor Hackford.  His acute eye for detail is fantastic here, and is a huge step up from his previous work.  Technically `Ray' is far from my favorite biopic, even in the year of the biopic it falls short of perfection and or utter brilliance, but when `Ray' hits its mark it hits it with such beautiful depth and clarity that it makes up for its minor shortcomings.  Did it deserve a `Best Picture' Oscar nomination?  Not really, but I'm not going to whine about that too much.Another aspect of the film that shines like a diamond among pearls is the impressive female supporting cast, all of which deserved any and all recognition and praise for they all were essential in not only developing the man that was Ray into a full blown character study but they were also pertinent in making `Ray' the film a film entertaining and relatable from beginning to end.  Kerry Washington, an actress I've just fallen in love with over the years, gives such a brutally honest performance as Charles wife, the woman who stands by her man and supports him despite his addictions to drugs and loose women.  Regina King gives probably the most explosive performance of the bunch as Margie, one of Ray's backup singers and his obsessive secret lover.  Her brilliance on screen is matched only by her spunk and heart and it's a true pleasure to watch her chew each and every scene she encounters.  Sharon Warren also does a splendid job as Ray's mother and is sure to stand out as a remembered favorite.The life of Ray Charles was a hard one, full of deceit, drugs, women and pressure.  He was abused, taken advantage of and used and on the other side he abused, took advantage of and used others in the process, but the true story of Ray Charles is a story about overcoming our weaknesses and growing into the person we knew we had in us all along, the person who has been dying to come out but just needed to opportunity.  My one big disappointment with this film is that it never truly shows us the recovery Ray made.  We see his struggles, his problems and his faults.

629262,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,B00005JND5,andy8047,"[0, 1]","Rhythm & Blues legend Ray Charles passed away on June 10,2004 shortly after production was completed on this film. Charles definitely would have attended the premiere had he lived. It was only on October 29,2004 that this film was theatrically released and grossed five million dollars in the first week of its release. Jamie Foxx plays Charles who had been blind since early childhood. This film begins set in 1948,where we see Ray on a bus to a performance of a country and western hoedown. Ray is invited to join the band despite his blindness and no knowledge(back then) of C&W music. But in time,Ray learns about the genre which would lead to a hit recording of his,I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU which was covered by many other artists. The song was written by John Gibson and one of the many other artists to cover the song was the late Jim Reeves. This is the beginning of Ray's musical career. Ray would play in various nightclubs before signing his first recording contract. Kurt Fuller(GHOSTBUSTERS 2,WAYNE'S WORLD) plays Ray's business manager. As early as 1957,Ray would be gracing radio airwaves with hit songs like WHAT'D I SAY?. But,he'd never come close to Elvis Presley in many aspects. In 1960,his biggest hit debuted on the radio,that being GEORGIA ON MY MIND. The song was been Georgia's state song since 1979. GOMM was covered by the Righteous Brothers,Willie Nelson and Michael Bolton,to name a few artists. Bolton's cover was a Top 20 hit also. Of course,we also hear HIT THE ROAD JACK and NIGHT TIME IS THE RIGHT TIME. I first heard the latter song on a 1985 Cosby Show episode. In that episode,the Huxtable family lip-sync and dance to the song for Cliff Huxtable's parents who are celebrating 49 years of marriage. Ray's career begins to falter as he turns to drugs. He enters a rehab clinic and eventually recovers. Also from 1964 to 1979,he was banned from performing in Georgia because he refused to play for a certain audience. When GOMM became Georgia's state song,Ray was welcomed back there. This film is only a semi-autobiography since it features no post-1979 events of Charles' life. One of those events was his participation in the 1985 fund-raising recording of WE ARE THE WORLD which was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson. Charles was one of the all-star ensemble called USA For Africa(Richie and Jackson were part of the ensemble as well). Another is a duet with Billy Joel called BABY GRAND,written by Joel. Joel was part of USA For Africa also. I dedicate this film to the memory of Charles. He was only 74 years old when he succumbed to lung cancer.",5,Ray sings the blues!,1107216000,"02 1, 2005",2005,2597,"['Rhythm', 'Blues', 'legend', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'passed', 'away', 'June', '10,2004', 'shortly', 'production', 'was', 'completed', 'film', 'Charles', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'attended', 'premiere', 'had', 'lived', 'was', 'only', 'October', '29,2004', 'film', 'was', 'theatrically', 'released', 'grossed', 'five', 'million', 'dollars', 'first', 'week', 'release', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'blind', 'early', 'childhood', 'film', 'set', '1948', 'where', 'see', 'Ray', 'bus', 'performance', 'country', 'western', 'hoedown', 'Ray', 'invited', 'join', 'band', 'blindness', 'knowledge', 'back', 'then', 'C', 'W', 'music', 'time', 'Ray', 'genre', 'would', 'lead', 'hit', 'recording', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'STOP', 'LOVING', 'YOU', 'was', 'covered', 'many', 'other', 'artists', 'song', 'was', 'written', 'John', 'Gibson', 'one', 'many', 'other', 'artists', 'cover', 'song', 'was', 'late', 'Jim', 'Reeves', 'beginning', 'Ray', 'musical', 'career', 'Ray', 'would', 'play', 'various', 'nightclubs', 'signing', 'first', 'recording', 'contract', 'Kurt', 'Fuller', 'GHOSTBUSTERS', '2', 'WAYNE', 'WORLD', 'Ray', 'business', 'manager', 'As', 'early', '1957', 'Ray', 'would', 'be', 'gracing', 'radio', 'airwaves', 'hit', 'songs', 'WHAT', ""'D"", 'SAY', ""'d"", 'never', 'come', 'close', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'many', 'aspects', '1960', 'biggest', 'hit', 'debuted', 'radio', 'being', 'GEORGIA', 'ON', 'MY', 'MIND', 'song', 'was', 'been', 'Georgia', 'state', 'song', '1979', 'GOMM', 'was', 'covered', 'Righteous', 'Brothers', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'Michael', 'Bolton', 'name', 'few', 'artists', 'Bolton', 'cover', 'was', 'Top', '20', 'hit', 'also', 'course', 'also', 'hear', 'HIT', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'JACK', 'NIGHT', 'TIME', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'TIME', 'first', 'heard', 'latter', 'song', '1985', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'episode', 'episode', 'Huxtable', 'family', 'lip-sync', 'dance', 'song', 'Cliff', 'Huxtable', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'celebrating', '49', 'years', 'marriage', 'Ray', 'career', 'falter', 'drugs', 'rehab', 'clinic', 'eventually', 'recovers', 'Also', '1964', '1979', 'was', 'banned', 'performing', 'Georgia', 'refused', 'play', 'certain', 'audience', 'When', 'GOMM', 'became', 'Georgia', 'state', 'song', 'Ray', 'was', 'welcomed', 'back', 'there', 'film', 'only', 'semi-autobiography', 'post-1979', 'events', 'Charles', 'life', 'One', 'events', 'was', 'participation', '1985', 'fund-raising', 'recording', 'WE', 'ARE', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'was', 'written', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Charles', 'was', 'one', 'all-star', 'ensemble', 'called', 'USA', 'Africa', 'Richie', 'Jackson', 'were', 'part', 'ensemble', 'as', 'well', 'duet', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'called', 'BABY', 'GRAND', 'written', 'Joel', 'Joel', 'was', 'part', 'USA', 'Africa', 'also', 'dedicate', 'film', 'memory', 'Charles', 'was', 'only', '74', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'succumbed', 'lung', 'cancer']",Ray
629263,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B00005JND5,Anthony Sanchez,"[6, 12]","I was hugely surprised when I finally had the chance to watch this movie.  I was not expecting an epic, but with all the high praise, I was waiting for something more than what was shown.  I have been a fan of Ray Charles since I was young and saw him perform in California.  He is one singer whose music will always be in style and he gave great interviews.  So what happened to this movie?The problem with the movie is the same with any characterization of a famous personality who is still so well known to the viewing public.  The movie cannot be done without paying strict attention to impersonating the subject to a tee.  But generally, when the effort is all in the impersonation then the acting suffers.  This was seen with Will Smith as Muhammad Ali.  He tried to get all the theatrics of Ali, but we learned nothing of Ali's character.Compare Foxx or Smith's performances with say Henry Fonda in Young Mr. Lincoln.  Was Fonda's portrayal of Lincoln perfect?  Who knows, we have no idea how Lincoln sounded or moved.  However, the movie gave us a very interesting idea of what Lincoln may have been like.  And that is how it usually fares for movies of more recent celebrities.  The one exception I know of is Denzell Washington's Malcolm X, who was both lauded for his similarity to his subject and for his acting.My comments are not necessarily a slight to Jamie Foxx or Will Smith, because the audience wouldn't tolerate a less than complete impersonation of someone with whom the public is already well acquainted.  But, impersonation does not equal great acting, or a great movie.  If not for the movie's music, I would have been completely put off.Not only did Foxx not give a best male acting job of all movies for the year, but his was not the best male acting in the movie Ray.  C.J. Sanders, who played Ray Charles as a youth was much more effective and provocative with his acting.  With Sanders, I felt something strong for Ray Charles.  I didn't with Foxx's acting.",2,"Best Impersonator, not Best Actor",1118188800,"06 8, 2005",2005,1987,"['was', 'hugely', 'surprised', 'when', 'finally', 'had', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'epic', 'high', 'praise', 'was', 'waiting', 'something', 'more', 'what', 'was', 'shown', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'young', 'saw', 'perform', 'California', 'one', 'singer', 'music', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'style', 'gave', 'great', 'interviews', 'So', 'what', 'happened', 'movie', 'problem', 'movie', 'same', 'characterization', 'famous', 'personality', 'who', 'still', 'so', 'well', 'known', 'viewing', 'public', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'paying', 'strict', 'attention', 'impersonating', 'subject', 'tee', 'generally', 'when', 'effort', 'impersonation', 'then', 'acting', 'suffers', 'was', 'seen', 'Will', 'Smith', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'tried', 'get', 'theatrics', 'Ali', 'learned', 'nothing', 'Ali', 'character.Compare', 'Foxx', 'Smith', 'performances', 'say', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'Young', 'Mr.', 'Lincoln', 'Was', 'Fonda', 'portrayal', 'Lincoln', 'perfect', 'Who', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'Lincoln', 'sounded', 'moved', 'However', 'movie', 'gave', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', 'what', 'Lincoln', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'how', 'usually', 'movies', 'more', 'recent', 'celebrities', 'one', 'exception', 'know', 'Denzell', 'Washington', 'Malcolm', 'X', 'who', 'was', 'lauded', 'similarity', 'subject', 'acting.My', 'comments', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'slight', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Will', 'Smith', 'audience', 'would', ""n't"", 'tolerate', 'less', 'complete', 'impersonation', 'someone', 'whom', 'public', 'already', 'well', 'acquainted', 'impersonation', 'not', 'equal', 'great', 'acting', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'movie', 'music', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'put', 'off.Not', 'only', 'did', 'Foxx', 'not', 'give', 'best', 'male', 'acting', 'job', 'movies', 'year', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'male', 'acting', 'movie', 'Ray', 'C.J', 'Sanders', 'who', 'played', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'youth', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'provocative', 'acting', 'Sanders', 'felt', 'something', 'strong', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'did', ""n't"", 'Foxx', 'acting']",Ray

Ryan ""Merribelle""","[87, 106]","I went to see Ray in the theaters last night because my sister suggested it and because I was in a mood to see something ""critically acclaimed"".  For the record, I knew very little about the man and so had very few preconceptions.  What I saw made a deep impression in my mind and heart.Ray Robinson, aka Ray Charles the singer, songwriter and musician, was blind since the age of 7.  He had to deal not only with bigotry for his disability but for being black in Georgia before the civil rights movement.  Throughout his life many people (both black and white) would try to take advantage of the blind man, ripping him off financially or  hoarding his talent for their own gain. Ray had both the blessing and the curse of being a ladies' man, resulting in serial affairs while his wife stayed home and raised their family.  It surprised me to learn that he fought an addiction to heroin for well over a decade before finally beating it in the `60s.  Nevertheless, Ray carried all this baggage and more through the 40s and 50s as he made a name for himself playing piano in the Country, Jazz, etc. pop music circuits.  Eventually of course he rose to become one of the most recognized and beloved musical artists worldwide.The man that this film showed me was an incredible example of determination, charm and simple human spirit.  I have heard others say that Jamie Foxx's acting was so good that they were half-convinced he was channeling Ray Charles' ghost.  I'll take their word for it that it was an accurate performance, but regardless, it was also a great performance!  Down the line each of the supporting actors was perfectly convincing and real, but none more so than Foxx.  I will denounce the Academy if he isn't at least nominated for an Oscar.The least of Ray's imperfections was his physical blindness --yet he had a powerful gift and the ability to reach into the collective soul of a nation. Over his long career as a musician and songwriter, Ray Charles Robinson created and performed some of the most memorable music to audiences across the country.  Your color, age and creed doesn't matter; chances are, you've heard and loved at least one Ray Charles song in your lifetime.  We'll never have another like him.-Andrea, aka Merribelle.",5,The Life's story of an imperfect man who did amazing things,1100217600,"11 12, 2004",2004,2255,"['went', 'see', 'Ray', 'theaters', 'last', 'night', 'sister', 'suggested', 'was', 'mood', 'see', 'something', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'record', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'man', 'so', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'preconceptions', 'What', 'saw', 'made', 'deep', 'impression', 'mind', 'heart.Ray', 'Robinson', 'aka', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'musician', 'was', 'blind', 'age', '7', 'had', 'deal', 'not', 'only', 'bigotry', 'disability', 'being', 'black', 'Georgia', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'life', 'many', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'blind', 'man', 'ripping', 'off', 'financially', 'hoarding', 'talent', 'own', 'gain', 'Ray', 'had', 'blessing', 'curse', 'being', 'ladies', 'man', 'resulting', 'serial', 'affairs', 'wife', 'stayed', 'home', 'raised', 'family', 'surprised', 'learn', 'fought', 'addiction', 'heroin', 'well', 'decade', 'finally', 'beating', '60s', 'Nevertheless', 'Ray', 'carried', 'baggage', 'more', '40s', '50s', 'made', 'name', 'playing', 'piano', 'Country', 'Jazz', 'etc', 'pop', 'music', 'circuits', 'Eventually', 'course', 'rose', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'recognized', 'beloved', 'musical', 'artists', 'worldwide.The', 'man', 'film', 'showed', 'was', 'incredible', 'example', 'determination', 'charm', 'simple', 'human', 'spirit', 'have', 'heard', 'others', 'say', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'good', 'were', 'half-convinced', 'was', 'channeling', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'ghost', ""'ll"", 'take', 'word', 'was', 'accurate', 'performance', 'regardless', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'performance', 'line', 'supporting', 'actors', 'was', 'perfectly', 'convincing', 'real', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'Foxx', 'will', 'denounce', 'Academy', ""n't"", 'least', 'nominated', 'Oscar.The', 'least', 'Ray', 'imperfections', 'was', 'physical', 'blindness', 'yet', 'had', 'powerful', 'gift', 'ability', 'reach', 'collective', 'soul', 'nation', 'long', 'career', 'musician', 'songwriter', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'created', 'performed', 'most', 'memorable', 'music', 'audiences', 'country', 'color', 'age', 'creed', ""n't"", 'matter', 'chances', 'are', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'loved', 'least', 'one', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'song', 'lifetime', ""'ll"", 'never', 'have', 'like', 'him.-Andrea', 'aka', 'Merribelle']",Ray

The music is strong, using Ray Charles' own tracks for both background and performance shots. The storyline is complex, flashing back to Charles' youth as he reflected on the loss of his eyesight and the death of his brother.From his days as a child in a poor rural community, through his early days as an unknown musician struggling to get a fair deal, to his mid-career with management problems, affairs, hits, and drugs, and then, finally, as a one of our national heroes, we see Ray Charles in full color.We learn how he manipulated women, cheated on his wife, became addicted to heroin, found his sound, got his name, and learned to work aggressively as his own musician. He deals with racism at first by avoiding it, and then quickly, takes a harsh stand, shaming the bigots and segregationists. Now, in a state where he was once banned from playing, his work, ""Georgia on My Mind"" is now the state song.Biopics of celebrities are difficult to describe because of the chronology required to produce the movies. People don't live out plots written by screenwriters, but lives that have events that do not always make sense. Ray Charles' life didn't always make sense, but he lived it.We have two views of Ray Charles. One is as a fighter, working hard against adversity to become the musician we now know. The other is as a womanizing addict who used his charm, position and trust of his wife to diminish all that was good about him. He eventually beats the drugs, holds onto his marriage, but these failures brought down my respect of him.Jamie Foxx never impressed me before this. I found his comedy more off-color than I prefer, and expected that his version of Ray Charles would be mediocre. I heard the hype that his performance was Oscar-worthy, and watched the movie with the eyes of a skeptic. Now, I am impressed.Jamie Foxx has a new fan. I hope he gets roles that allow him to shine like he does in ""Ray.""The DVD for ""Ray"" adds to the movie. Normally, a DVD brings little extra that is interesting, but watching Jamie Foxx and Ray Charles interact was touching, as was hearing Foxx describe his experience in learning the role. We learn Foxx not only can play piano, but is trained at a high level. Those are his hands on the keys, and not movie magic.

But after seeing the movie and at the end where Ray ""promised"" that he'll stay clean...and did, brings a whole different light of admiration for him. One of the things I remember about him most was when he played on a a few eps on The Nanny and how CUTE he was! I always loved his smile and I always loved on how he would sometimes laugh at his own one-liners he would make. Other than his voice, it's his smile that I'll miss the most. He's definately healed on the other side and I'm sure he's creating his own sold-out concerts there as well.I just thought it was sad that his passing was over-shadowed with Reagan's passing (someone whom I also adored). Mr. Charles, you are not forgotten and you will never be as well. Thank you for your sacrifice and talents you shared to so many millions here. :)And as for the movie itself, it was awesome.

629268,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JND5,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[2, 3]","Making a biography on anyone can sometimes be a tricky thing. But something even trickier is casting the right person in the role to really capture the subject they are documenting. Jamie Foxx, as Ray Charles, may just go down in the history books as one of the all time finest portrayals of a real person. I've seem good ones before, but I haven't seen a job thid good before in a loooong time. After watching him in the movie, you can't see him as being Jamie Foxx. You see Ray Charles. And when the movie is over, you can't see anybody as Ray Charles than Jamie Foxx. When I first saw the trailer in a ""sneak peek exlucisve"" on one of those entertianment shows, I knew right then and there that Jamie would win an Oscar. The film chronicles the life of the legend from 1948 until the mid 60's. There are flashbacks tho to his childhood strewn all thru the film, and a brief moment at the end taken place in 1979, but the majority of the sprawling film is from 1948 to about 1965. So no, it does not take on the last two decades or so of his life, or his saddening death. The film showcases the amazing and sometimes out of control life of this music pioneer. When he first went blind as a young child, to leaving home to Seattle to start his career. Ray worked in clubs, and was the piano man in bands, but always wanted to go slowly. Ray Robinson, as he was born, quickly took his middle name of Charles as his stage name, and went on the road that eventually led to super stardom. The film highlights his highs and lows, and puts together his genius as a performer/singer/musician alongside his problem areas as a philandering husband, and a man with a serious heroin addiction. Foxx is so good in his role it's scary. He has the Ray Charles mannerisms down to perfection. Ray has a distinct walk and a way he holds himself, and Jamie did it as if it were Ray himself. In fact, everything he does is as if it was Ray himself. Becuse that's who you see. Ray Charles. Not Jamie Foxx. And I think that is as big a compliment as you can give. He is utterly stunning. The good news is that the good stuff doesn't end with Foxx. He is surrounded by a strong cast who all put in noteworthy performances. Kerry Washington as his first wife, who he affectionatley called B, is wonderful. As is former ""227"" star Regina King as Margie, one of the Ray-lettes who he had an affair with and later bore one of his children. Clifton Powell is strong and steady as Jeff, Ray's good friend and partner thru many years. Larenz Tate has a small role as a very young Quincy Jones. Richard Schiff from ""The West Wing"" also appears as a producer from Atlantic records. His partner at Atlantic records is none other than ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" star Curtis Armstrong(who played Booger), who appears to have shaved his head for the role. He is not really bald. Director Taylor Hackford directs the proceedings with a firm hand. He re-creates the years and decades with impeccable accuracy. He really gets the right look, clothes, cars, mood, and music. He brings Ray and his surroundings to life. Some say there was a lot more to be told that wasn't included. The movie is two and ahalf hours long as it is. Any more stuff and the film would of been 5 hours long. Then there is the music itself. Most of Ray's most famous recordings are heard and seen when he first did them and they were first heard. Ray's music was one of a kind, and the music you hear in the picture is the real deal. Some people might not of known of Ray's real life, so the film may of come to a sort of a shock to them. But it is so painfully brave and truthful to get Ray and his story out there, that you have to stand up and salute Ray for telling it like it is. Warts and all. And for Jamie Foxx, for bringing to life an extraordinary performance of an extraordinary man. This was a good year for bio pic movies, and ""Ray"" is one of the best in a long time.

629271,AR37967IAR6ZT,B00005JND5,Benjamin,"[13, 16]","""Ray,"" which I just caught in a sneak preview, is a grand film. It's vastly entertaining, incredibly well-acted and visually striking. Beyond that, the film gives a warts-and-all portrayal of its talented and troubled subject, Ray Charles.Though it deals primarily with Charles's attempts to make it in the music business and his struggles with womanizing and drug addiction, the film's most touching moments come from jarring flashes to his troubled, rural childhood. One scene, in which Charles's strong mother teaches him how to be self-reliant in spite of his blindness, is played without dialogue, yet the power of the scene reduced me to tears.Also, the film answers some key questions about how Charles coped with blindness and racism during his life.Jamie Foxx, who was already brilliant this year in ""Collateral,"" gives his greatest performance to date as Charles. He has the mannerisms of the musician down, yet Foxx does more than mimic Charles and play up the man's disability. He's able to give Charles a sympathetic edge necessary throughout the film, even when Charles does some despicable things to his business partners and the women in his life. Foxx carries the movie, pays proper tribute to an American legend while keeping him human and injects the movie with enthusiasm and a sense of humor. This is the sort of acting that should and hopefully will garner an Academy Award nomination.Charles filled his life with intelligent, strong women. Kerry Washington and Regina King, playing his wife Della and his mistress Margie Hendrix, give notable performances in the film.Though the film has some flaws, it's compelling and watchable. And the touching story has an added impact because of Charles's recent death.Thankfully, the movie, done with Charles's approval before his death, is filled with his great music.I highly recommend ""Ray.""",5,"Best music biopic since ""What's Love Got to Do With It""",1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,1857,"['Ray', 'just', 'caught', 'sneak', 'preview', 'grand', 'film', 'vastly', 'entertaining', 'incredibly', 'well-acted', 'visually', 'striking', 'Beyond', 'film', 'warts-and-all', 'portrayal', 'talented', 'troubled', 'subject', 'Ray', 'Charles.Though', 'primarily', 'Charles', 'attempts', 'make', 'music', 'business', 'struggles', 'womanizing', 'drug', 'addiction', 'film', 'most', 'touching', 'moments', 'come', 'jarring', 'flashes', 'troubled', 'rural', 'childhood', 'One', 'scene', 'Charles', 'strong', 'mother', 'teaches', 'how', 'be', 'self-reliant', 'spite', 'blindness', 'played', 'dialogue', 'yet', 'power', 'scene', 'reduced', 'tears.Also', 'film', 'key', 'questions', 'how', 'Charles', 'coped', 'blindness', 'racism', 'life.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'brilliant', 'year', 'Collateral', 'greatest', 'performance', 'date', 'Charles', 'mannerisms', 'musician', 'down', 'yet', 'Foxx', 'more', 'mimic', 'Charles', 'play', 'up', 'man', 'disability', 'able', 'give', 'Charles', 'sympathetic', 'edge', 'necessary', 'film', 'even', 'when', 'Charles', 'despicable', 'things', 'business', 'partners', 'women', 'life', 'Foxx', 'movie', 'proper', 'tribute', 'American', 'legend', 'keeping', 'human', 'movie', 'enthusiasm', 'sense', 'humor', 'sort', 'acting', 'should', 'hopefully', 'will', 'garner', 'Academy', 'Award', 'filled', 'life', 'intelligent', 'strong', 'women', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Regina', 'King', 'playing', 'wife', 'Della', 'mistress', 'Margie', 'Hendrix', 'give', 'notable', 'performances', 'film.Though', 'film', 'flaws', 'compelling', 'watchable', 'touching', 'story', 'added', 'impact', 'Charles', 'recent', 'death.Thankfully', 'movie', 'done', 'Charles', 'approval', 'death', 'filled', 'great', 'music.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Ray']",Ray

629276,A3AF8P0GINFADV,B00005JND5,Black Barbie,"[0, 1]","Jamie Foxx is the actor on the critics' lips. It is worthy praise? Without a doubt. Besides his resemblance to Ray Charles, Foxx embodies the man himself in essence. It is almost eerie how perfectly Foxx becomes Charles from his mannerisms, his strong but stubborn personality and his behaviour. Before seeing the film, I heard all of the hype surrounding Foxx and just thought that he would be good as Ray Charles. Good is an understatement. He was unbelievable. Even if the Oscars do not grant him his ticket to join the elite group of Sidney Poitier, Louis Gossett Jr and Denzel Washington, it doesn't matter because his performance will be remembered as a mile stone in drama.With Foxx's potent portrayal, the supporting cast had riveting and convincing. This film is different because the whole supporting cast is great.The women of this film are wicked: Regina King (Margie, one of his many mistresses) and Kerry Washington (Della Bea) were outstanding! King and Washington had brilliant screen chemistry with Foxx, their performances had charm, wit and sheer power. Sharon Warren, a newcomer, played Ray's mother, Aretha and proved what an exceptional acting talent she is. Yet, the men of film stood on their own two feet. Famous faces such as Harry Lennix as Joe, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet, Clifton Powell as Jeff and Larenz Tate as Quincy Jones brought a real edge to the film, equaling the female force.It was undoubtedly going to be hard to squeeze a 40 year music career, a man's troubles, the pain and effect he had on others in 2 hours but this film works because it aims for the drama and the legend of the man, instead of a point by point narrative. While this may annoy some purists, if it was done too accurately, it would have been too long and thus relegated to the late hours of television. The cinema is the perfect platform to show the life and spirit of Ray Charles and through this, it will introduce more people to him - what could be cooler than that?When biopics are bad, you can just feel yourself wanting to fall asleep: the incompetence of the actors becomes annoying, the predictable direction of the film from 0 to the end is boring and the tedious nature of the script leaves you feel like you want your dosh back. When biopics are good, they are like `Ray': magnificent drama, engrossing characters, beautiful music, subtle but unforced direction that makes you think.Last Thought: Has DiCaprio seen this film yet?",5,Groundbreaking,1106697600,"01 26, 2005",2005,2450,"['Jamie', 'Foxx', 'actor', 'critics', 'lips', 'worthy', 'praise', 'doubt', 'resemblance', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Foxx', 'man', 'essence', 'almost', 'eerie', 'how', 'perfectly', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'mannerisms', 'strong', 'stubborn', 'personality', 'behaviour', 'seeing', 'film', 'heard', 'hype', 'surrounding', 'Foxx', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Good', 'understatement', 'was', 'unbelievable', 'Even', 'Oscars', 'do', 'not', 'grant', 'ticket', 'join', 'elite', 'group', 'Sidney', 'Poitier', 'Louis', 'Gossett', 'Jr', 'Denzel', 'Washington', ""n't"", 'matter', 'performance', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'mile', 'stone', 'drama.With', 'Foxx', 'potent', 'portrayal', 'supporting', 'cast', 'had', 'riveting', 'convincing', 'film', 'different', 'whole', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great.The', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'wicked', 'Regina', 'King', 'Margie', 'one', 'many', 'mistresses', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Della', 'Bea', 'were', 'outstanding', 'King', 'Washington', 'had', 'brilliant', 'screen', 'chemistry', 'Foxx', 'performances', 'had', 'charm', 'wit', 'sheer', 'power', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'newcomer', 'played', 'Ray', 'mother', 'Aretha', 'proved', 'what', 'exceptional', 'acting', 'talent', 'men', 'film', 'stood', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'Famous', 'such', 'Harry', 'Lennix', 'Joe', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Ahmet', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'Jeff', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'brought', 'real', 'edge', 'film', 'equaling', 'female', 'force.It', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'squeeze', '40', 'year', 'music', 'career', 'man', 'troubles', 'pain', 'effect', 'had', 'others', '2', 'hours', 'film', 'drama', 'legend', 'man', 'instead', 'point', 'point', 'narrative', 'may', 'annoy', 'purists', 'was', 'done', 'too', 'accurately', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'long', 'thus', 'relegated', 'late', 'hours', 'television', 'cinema', 'perfect', 'platform', 'show', 'life', 'spirit', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'will', 'introduce', 'more', 'people', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'cooler', 'When', 'biopics', 'are', 'bad', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'wanting', 'fall', 'asleep', 'incompetence', 'actors', 'annoying', 'predictable', 'direction', 'film', '0', 'end', 'boring', 'tedious', 'nature', 'script', 'feel', 'want', 'dosh', 'back', 'When', 'biopics', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'Ray', 'magnificent', 'drama', 'engrossing', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'music', 'subtle', 'unforced', 'direction', 'think.Last', 'Thought', 'Has', 'DiCaprio', 'seen', 'film', 'yet']",Ray

Like Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings, and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, and Marlon Brando as The Godfather, you just can't picture anyone else playing Ray Charles other than Mr. Foxx. His acting was superlative, his knowledge of the material (Ray Charles himself), mind-boggling. It was worth the price of admission just to see how much he ""owned"" this role.But one great actor does not a great movie make. I will give credit to the filming, cinematography, and the other minor characters in the film. The problem I had, though, was that I felt the psychological impact of Ray's childhood was forced upon me as the viewer. I felt like the screenwriters were saying, ""Okay, here we need to have the audience in tears"", and ""Here we need them to have empathy with Ray for his horrible childhood"". Because of this, the emotional impact on me was negligible.I will say that I did learn a thing or two about Mr. Charles' life. For instance, I had no idea that he had such a horrible heroin addiction for so long. I remember reading about some of this in the papers years ago but I wasn't aware that it had started so early in his musical career, and how much it affected his life and music much later on.And here's an interesting thing to me: I actually BOUGHT this film on DVD.

Other than that, there is virtually no depth to any of the characters in the movie whatsoever, which is a crying shame because there were so many strong characters who had significant roles in Ray Charles' life and who more than deserve a closer look. I felt the movie's motive was more to clear Ray Charles' name in any of the dubious matters in his life, to shape the way Ray Charles will be remembered (which, incidentally, is exactly what Milan Kundera describes in his book, Immortality...). The movie is trying to ensure that Ray will be remembered in a positive way, while still maintaining his family's privacy, spinning a positive tone on all of his bad deeds (ie. yes, he was a drug addict, but he kicked the habit; yes, he had an illegitimate son, but he paid his dues in child support, etc.) Instead of throwing a flattering light on the man, it has an opposite effect on me. Perhaps, this movie should not have been completed so soon after his death. Time is needed for tears to be shed and old wounds to heal before the truth can be revealed.What little that was portrayed of his personal life were outstandingly performed by the actors who played his mother, wife, mistress and Ray as a child - which is a shame because they did an outstanding job and the reason for my 3 star rating. The actress who portrayed Ray's mother did an amazing performance and if anybody deserved an award, it should have been her. Yes, Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job replicating Ray Charles' outside appearances and all the tics of his behavior, however we all know very well what and how Ray Charles looked like, being that he only just recently passed away. There was very little effort in showing the core essence of the man, which is no fault of Foxx.An alright movie portraying a very glossy depiction of Ray Charles' life, with special attention in setting the record straight with his business deals and associations, and little effort in revealing who Ray Charles the man is and anyone else in his life.",3,Disappointing,1135728000,"12 28, 2005",2005,2108,"['movie', 'excellent', 'job', 'clarifying', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'business', 'arrangements', 'partnerships', 'Other', 'virtually', 'depth', 'characters', 'movie', 'whatsoever', 'crying', 'shame', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'strong', 'characters', 'who', 'had', 'significant', 'roles', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'life', 'who', 'more', 'deserve', 'closer', 'look', 'felt', 'movie', 'motive', 'was', 'more', 'clear', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'name', 'dubious', 'matters', 'life', 'shape', 'way', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'incidentally', 'exactly', 'what', 'Milan', 'Kundera', 'book', 'Immortality', 'movie', 'trying', 'ensure', 'Ray', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'positive', 'way', 'still', 'maintaining', 'family', 'privacy', 'spinning', 'positive', 'tone', 'bad', 'deeds', 'ie', 'yes', 'was', 'drug', 'addict', 'kicked', 'habit', 'yes', 'had', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'paid', 'dues', 'child', 'support', 'etc', 'Instead', 'throwing', 'flattering', 'light', 'man', 'opposite', 'effect', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'completed', 'so', 'soon', 'death', 'Time', 'needed', 'tears', 'be', 'shed', 'old', 'wounds', 'heal', 'truth', 'can', 'be', 'revealed.What', 'little', 'was', 'portrayed', 'personal', 'life', 'were', 'outstandingly', 'performed', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'mother', 'wife', 'mistress', 'Ray', 'child', 'shame', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'reason', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'actress', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Ray', 'mother', 'did', 'amazing', 'performance', 'anybody', 'deserved', 'award', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Yes', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'did', 'outstanding', 'job', 'replicating', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'outside', 'appearances', 'tics', 'behavior', 'however', 'know', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'how', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'looked', 'being', 'only', 'just', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'effort', 'showing', 'core', 'essence', 'man', 'fault', 'Foxx.An', 'alright', 'movie', 'portraying', 'very', 'glossy', 'depiction', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'life', 'special', 'attention', 'setting', 'record', 'straight', 'business', 'deals', 'associations', 'little', 'effort', 'revealing', 'who', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'man', 'anyone', 'else', 'life']",Ray

629287,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JND5,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[0, 3]","Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Ray is a captivating and inspiring true story about a man beloved by millions around the world. Based on the life and times of Ray Charles Robinson, the film follows the popular singer's life from the earliest days of his youth to the day of his triumph over a heroin addiction. Featuring a soundtrack second to none in the history of cinema, Ray is the total package in terms of a blockbuster film - great characters blended together with an inspirational personal journey and an unforgettable musical score. Actor Jamie Foxx gives an Oscar Award winning performance so lifelike that it's difficult to distinguish his character from the real Ray Charles. In short, Ray is a film that appeals to a wide audience and one that literally transports its viewers into another era...Jamie Foxx plays the role of Ray Charles Robinson, a black youth growing up in Florida during the Great Depression. Forced to deal with the tragedy of his kid brother's death, and the loss of his own vision at a young age, Ray nevertheless triumphs over his disability when his mother refuses to let him feel sorry for himself. Learning to play the piano from a neighborhood musician, Ray strikes out on his own in the late-1940s for gig in Seattle.Ray's amazing talents are instantly recognized, and he's never short of a gig. However, while traveling on the road with several jazz bands, Ray begins using drugs, and he eventually becomes addicted to heroin. When Atlantic Records buys Ray's contract, Ray's career accelerates, culminating in several number one hits. Eventually, Ray strikes a deal with NBC worth more than any other performer of his day, and he and his wife Bea buy a luxurious Beverly Hills home with the world spread out before them.But things aren't as perfect as they seem. Ray's infidelities have taken a toll on his marriage, and his drug addiction threatens to ruin his family, his relationship with his children, and his dealings with longtime friends. Having already accomplished more than most men, Ray Charles must now face the greatest challenge of his life - overcoming his heroin addiction and living a clean life...Jamie Foxx is simply astounding in his portrayal of the larger than life figure Ray Charles, and his effort was more than acknowledged by his Academy Award victory and widespread critical acclaim. But less attention is given to the outstanding supporting cast that surrounds Foxx. The role of the young Ray Robinson's mother, Aretha, is played by Sharon Warren with such passion that her character leaps off the screen and into one's memory as the second most influential character of the film. Aretha's dedication to her son's future and her demanding, yet loving, attitude toward his self-sufficiency are admirable qualities. And the mother's influence on Ray is apparent in his drive not to be treated by the world as a cripple.Further adding to the allure of Ray are performances by Kerry Washington (Della Bea Robinson), Regina King (Margie Hendricks), and Clifton Powell (Jeff Brown). Through the interaction of each character, the viewer sees a reflection of the passion and driving life forces that moved Ray Charles toward his musical destiny. Ultimately, Ray is a film about relationships and dreams.

It's entirely my failing, but my mood was just never conducive to a downbeat, two-and-a-half hour dissection of someone I prefer to remain in awe of.Having seen it now on DVD, I sorely wish I'd seen and heard it in theaters because it's a joltingly good film.  It understands the music and presents it in an absolutely riveting way; it respects the side characters (the Raylettes, Ertegum, Wexler, Fathead, Dowd, et al) and while the film may have a few more glowing sunbeams and moments of boldfaced exposition than I would've preferred, it really gets to the core of its central figure.What more can be said about Jamie Foxx as Ray?  I'll say that he creates a spooky combination of magic and electricity.  Some complain that he's merely doing an impersonation, and there's a grain of truth to that, but what a tricky and idiosyncratic impersonation it is. Somehow Foxx articulates a crucial by-product of Ray's necessary self-reliance: what must have been an almost purgatorial sense of loneliness. Had Foxx been just a hair or two off, the whole show would've been sunk but he pulls it off gloriously.His performance is matched by, and married to, the music, which is fantastic.  So many scenes stick out for me -- Ray, ecstatically smacking the lid of his piano during ""Straighten Up and Fly Right"" ; the harmonies of the Raylettes, combined with the faces of the actresses, during ""Leave My Woman Alone"" and ""What Kind of Man Are You?"" ; the furious, kinetic leap into ""The Messaround"" and especially the segue between one of the most devastating scenes in the film (Ray's childhood descent into blindness) and the lilting, electric notes that lead into ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand.""That's one of my favorite moments of the past year; it seems a gently musical way of saying, ""Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes they lead to beautiful things like this....""",4,Joltingly good -  I wish I'd seen it on the big screen (4.5),1107648000,"02 6, 2005",2005,1910,"['missed', 'Ray', 'theaters', 'last', 'fall', 'entirely', 'failing', 'mood', 'was', 'just', 'never', 'conducive', 'downbeat', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'dissection', 'someone', 'prefer', 'remain', 'awe', 'of.Having', 'seen', 'now', 'DVD', 'sorely', 'wish', ""'d"", 'seen', 'heard', 'theaters', 'joltingly', 'good', 'film', 'music', 'presents', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'way', 'side', 'characters', 'Raylettes', 'Ertegum', 'Wexler', 'Fathead', 'Dowd', 'et', 'al', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'few', 'more', 'glowing', 'sunbeams', 'moments', 'boldfaced', 'exposition', 'would', ""'ve"", 'preferred', 'really', 'core', 'central', 'figure.What', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', ""'ll"", 'say', 'spooky', 'combination', 'magic', 'electricity', 'complain', 'merely', 'doing', 'impersonation', 'grain', 'truth', 'what', 'tricky', 'idiosyncratic', 'impersonation', 'Somehow', 'Foxx', 'crucial', 'by-product', 'Ray', 'necessary', 'self-reliance', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'almost', 'purgatorial', 'sense', 'loneliness', 'Had', 'Foxx', 'been', 'just', 'hair', 'two', 'whole', 'show', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'sunk', 'off', 'gloriously.His', 'performance', 'matched', 'married', 'music', 'fantastic', 'So', 'many', 'scenes', 'stick', 'out', 'Ray', 'ecstatically', 'smacking', 'lid', 'piano', 'Straighten', 'Up', 'Fly', 'Right', 'harmonies', 'Raylettes', 'combined', 'actresses', 'Leave', 'My', 'Woman', 'Alone', 'What', 'Kind', 'Man', 'Are', 'furious', 'kinetic', 'leap', 'Messaround', 'especially', 'segue', 'one', 'most', 'devastating', 'scenes', 'film', 'Ray', 'childhood', 'descent', 'blindness', 'lilting', 'electric', 'notes', 'lead', 'Baby', 'Let', 'Me', 'Hold', 'Hand', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'past', 'year', 'gently', 'musical', 'way', 'saying', 'Yes', 'terrible', 'things', 'happen', 'sometimes', 'lead', 'beautiful', 'things']",Ray

And sure enough, he won it. It is quite a performance but looking at the rest of the film, there's parts where it just unravels slightly and looks like a better editor needed to be on.Ray Robinson became blind at the age of 7 and had to grow up with not only a loving but kind of stern mother, he had to live with his brother's accidental drowning, since Ray froze and hesitated. He does become quite a piano player so we follow him as people take advantage a bit as he's in a club only to have the manager become his woman and have him being paid less than everyone else.He starts to come onto his own when he starts to marry rhythm and blues with gospel music(with the not unexpected outcries from religious people) and meets Della, who ends up becoming his wife and mother to his children. However, he's quite a womanizer and has some other women on the road. Not to mention he starts a heroin addiction.One thing that is quite a watch is seeing Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray Charles. Many people say he's channeling the late legend, but personally it's almost like he becomes the guy a good portion of the time that it practically looks eerie. Kerry Washington is quite good as the wife but her character is a bit unbelievable: she knows her husband has an addiction and has strayed yet she stays with him and doesn't really have that commanding ""don't do that anymore"" that wives like to do with their husbands. Regina King has one of his mistresses and backup singers, well I never did like her in any movies. She always seems to come off as bitchy and needy for some reason.The other issue I have is the dramatic license that tends to happen. Like the water scenes(you'll see what I mean). It seems a bit too over-the-top and too sappy, especially the rehab scene where he ""confronts"" his demons. Not to mention it's way too long.As for the music, there's no denying Ray Charles's talent but I just couldn't get to liking his music. That one song he plays after he just sleeps with Della for the first time is good but the rest of it I couldn't get into it. However kudos for putting in my 3nd favorite Beethoven piece Moonlight Sonata(first being Fur Elise and then Ode to Joy).It's way too long but watch it for the performance.

All the actors and actresses delivered outstanding performances, but especially the one by Jamie Foxx who went above and beyond the call. I can see what all the fuss is about in regards to his performance because he truly shines as one of the greatest legends in music history. Ray Charles was blessed with his gift for music while Foxx was blessed with both acting and singing, talents which he pours his heart and soul into in this film, much like Ray did throughout his career.The tale weaved in this biography was very moving and seemed rather authentic. His drug addiction was somewhat romantisized I suppose, but at least the audience was given a taste of what it might have been like, a peak into the troubled times, the blues, of the musical genious.The setting, the cinematography, the costumes, the music and the people really helped bring this amazing tale to life, something which can be rather challenging given the long and tumultuous life that Ray Charles led. Even though the movie did not cover his entire career, it portrayed the most significant parts in an enlightening way, effectively pointing out what made Ray what he was, a soulful, incredibly talented genious who had a passion for music, life and women.I'd wager to say that Ray Charles' music can move me like no other musician can because it touches my soul, there's just something unique about his voice that brings out that emotion deep within a person, and that's what made Ray one of the greatest.  His music comes to life in this heartwarming tale.I really like this movie because it manages to accomplish that rare feat of capturing a little bit of that magic that Ray was blessed with, and something that special doesn't come along every day.If you watch this movie, you might get Georgia on your mind as well.",5,"Ray, A Beautiful Tale About Overcoming Life's Obstacles",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,1898,"['saw', 'movie', 'several', 'months', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'many', 'reasons', 'actors', 'actresses', 'delivered', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'especially', 'one', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'who', 'went', 'call', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'fuss', 'regards', 'performance', 'truly', 'one', 'greatest', 'legends', 'music', 'history', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'blessed', 'gift', 'music', 'Foxx', 'was', 'blessed', 'acting', 'singing', 'talents', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'much', 'Ray', 'did', 'career.The', 'tale', 'weaved', 'biography', 'was', 'very', 'moving', 'seemed', 'rather', 'authentic', 'drug', 'addiction', 'was', 'somewhat', 'romantisized', 'suppose', 'least', 'audience', 'was', 'given', 'taste', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'peak', 'troubled', 'times', 'blues', 'musical', 'genious.The', 'setting', 'cinematography', 'costumes', 'music', 'people', 'really', 'helped', 'bring', 'amazing', 'tale', 'life', 'something', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'challenging', 'given', 'long', 'tumultuous', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'led', 'Even', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'cover', 'entire', 'career', 'portrayed', 'most', 'significant', 'parts', 'enlightening', 'way', 'effectively', 'pointing', 'out', 'what', 'made', 'Ray', 'what', 'was', 'soulful', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'genious', 'who', 'had', 'passion', 'music', 'life', 'women.I', ""'d"", 'wager', 'say', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'music', 'can', 'move', 'other', 'musician', 'can', 'because', 'soul', 'just', 'something', 'unique', 'voice', 'out', 'emotion', 'deep', 'person', 'what', 'made', 'Ray', 'one', 'greatest', 'music', 'life', 'heartwarming', 'really', 'movie', 'accomplish', 'rare', 'feat', 'capturing', 'little', 'bit', 'magic', 'Ray', 'was', 'blessed', 'something', 'special', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'day.If', 'watch', 'movie', 'might', 'get', 'Georgia', 'mind', 'well']",Ray

So powerful was his performance that is overshadowed some excellent acting performances.  Kerry Washington and Regina King playing respectively Charles' wife Della Bea and his girlfriend Margie were wonderful in their roles.  Clifton Powell playing his personal handler Jeff was excellent in a supporting role.Taylor Hackford used a good combination of story telling and flashbacks to give us insight into the tumultuous life that Charles lead.  His hardscabble early life was engineered by his hard working and concerned single mom Aretha, played terrifically by newcomer Sharon Warren.  My only criticism of the plot was the blaming of his later life personal demons on the tragic drowning death of his younger brother George.Charles overcame glaucoma related blindness at the age of 7.  At the urging of his mom, learned music and life skills at a school for the blind.  Taken advantage of due to his disability, his talent ultimately propelled him to musical stardom.  His music, touring on the road and bad peer influence lead him into a life of heroin addiction and promiscuity.  He eventually overcame his dependence on drugs and philandering ways.  With the help of his steadfast and loving wife Della Bea, he re-established a solid family life.This powerful flick was a honest look into the celebrated life of a musical phenom complete with warts.

Jamie Foxx is a very talented man, theres no getting around that one either...but this movie was just not as good as it should have and could have been.  A bi-opic is tricky, you either have it or you don't.  There are many great ones (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man & Finding Neverland) and then there are ones that fall short of the mark like 'Ray'.  It's not an understatment to say that Foxx's performance SAVED this movie from becoming critic foder, and there are MANY critics who agree, this movie is really nothing without it's star performer.  Ray's life is intriging all in its own, but Taylor Hackford does a terrible job of piecing it together.  It was choppy and felt out of place, like scenes were thrown together last minute without really thinking about where they should go...(Remember Alexander anyone?)  Kerry Washington does a good job as the supporting wife (we've had an outstanding amount of supporting ladies lately) and I feel she too deserved the oscar nod for supporting actress and was yet robbed.  Really, Ray Charles was not much of a role model.  It's commendable that he overcame his vices (namely drugs and sex) but that is where I felt the movie went wrong.  There was too much focus on secondary things throughout the film that when we get to the end we've exhasted all our time and have no time left to really show us how Ray overcame his obsticles.  We see Ray in a hospital bed trying to recover and we see him go through his withdrawls but it's so quick and before you know it, he's healed.  What I loved about movies like 'A Beautiful Mind' was that it showed how his problems effected those around him BUT it also showed us how he fought to overcome them, and how he succeded.  Ray shows us how he wasted everything and everyone he ever loved and then it just tells us that he overcame his problems by showing us newspaper clippings and such.  Poor choice on Hackfords part.  I give this movie a 3 1/2 stars because Foxx did outstanding.

Jamie Foxx's portrayal of one of the world's greatest singers is marvelous (the soundtracks are Charles's originals). Born into grinding, rural poverty in Albany, Georgia, Charles's mother Aretha moved her family to Florida when he was an infant. By age 7 Charles was completely blind from glaucoma. This film tracks his life from then until 1966 or so when he finally beat a twenty-year heroin addiction. But I had several disappointments. By ending when Charles was only 36, this film neglects the entire last half of his life. His addiction to drugs and women (he fathered 12 children and was divorced twice), the powerful influence of his mother who taught him to avoid self-pity and to be his own person, and his guilt over his failure to save his little brother from a drowning accident when he was five, all figure more prominently than his musical genius. In his fifty-year career Charles performed 10,000 concerts, won 12 Grammys, and charted 85 singles. I wanted to learn more about how this genius fused Gospel, blues, country, jazz, and big band music into a raucous style all his own. Perhaps it is impossible for any film to capture a figure so much larger than life.

I loved how he played and sang his own parts, which added to the movie so much more than if he was lipsynching and not really playing the piano.  And I've never been a fan of Ray Charles' music but found myself liking it more as the movie went along because of all the emotion that was put into each song.  As many other reviewers stated, Ray was definitely an imperfect man who struggled with a lot while overcoming so much.  While at times the movie seemed to be repeating itself (girls, drugs, girls, drugs), its pace is excellent and the flashback scenes are extremely powerful.  I think Jamie Foxx had some strong emotional scenes that he tackled well, although I think that he didn't deserve to win best actor that year (Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Jim Caveizel in Passion of the Christ - who wasn't even nominated! - seemed to be much stronger.  Even Leonardo DiCaprio had a stronger performance as Howard Hughes).  I think a nomination was all he deserved, but oh well!  Great movie, small flaws, and it served its purpose - it brought you an entertaining movie that held nothing back, taught us a lot about Ray Charles, and had great music.  Not nearly as good and powerful as Walk The Line (which dealt with similar themes - brother's death, addictions, women that stood by their side, and music that lasted decades), but this movie is definitely worth checking out.",4,Better Than I Thought It Would Be,1150156800,"06 13, 2006",2006,1854,"['was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'was', 'when', 'watched', 'admit', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'great', 'job', 'portrayal', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'still', 'think', 'much', 'overrated', 'actor', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'worthwhile', 'again', 'thus', ""'ll"", 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'guy', 'played', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'so', 'well', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'natural', 'was', 'trying', 'hard', 'do', 'impersonation', 'most', 'part', 'felt', 'was', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'loved', 'how', 'played', 'sang', 'own', 'parts', 'added', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'lipsynching', 'not', 'really', 'playing', 'piano', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'fan', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'music', 'found', 'liking', 'more', 'movie', 'went', 'along', 'emotion', 'was', 'put', 'song', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'Ray', 'was', 'definitely', 'imperfect', 'man', 'who', 'struggled', 'lot', 'overcoming', 'so', 'much', 'times', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'repeating', 'girls', 'drugs', 'girls', 'drugs', 'pace', 'excellent', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'think', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'had', 'strong', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'tackled', 'well', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'win', 'best', 'actor', 'year', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Hotel', 'Rwanda', 'Jim', 'Caveizel', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'who', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'nominated', 'seemed', 'be', 'much', 'stronger', 'Even', 'Leonardo', 'DiCaprio', 'had', 'stronger', 'performance', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'think', 'nomination', 'was', 'deserved', 'oh', 'well', 'Great', 'movie', 'small', 'flaws', 'served', 'purpose', 'brought', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'held', 'nothing', 'back', 'taught', 'lot', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'had', 'great', 'music', 'Not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'powerful', 'Walk', 'Line', 'similar', 'themes', 'brother', 'death', 'addictions', 'women', 'stood', 'side', 'music', 'lasted', 'decades', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",Ray
629312,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,B00005JND5,David Anderson,"[2, 5]","""Ray"", released in 2004, garnered much critical acclaim from the critics.  The quality of this film proves them all as well-deserved, earning seven Oscar nomination including Best Picture and winning two (Best Sound Mixing and Best Actor).  It stars Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Clifton Powell, and others.  This film portrays the life and times of legendary musician Ray Charles.  It shows how he changed music history through his songs, his piano, and his vocals.  Through a grueling work schedule, heroin addiction, multiple sex partners, racism, and blindness, he overcomes every life obsticle wonderfully.  Meanwhile, it portrays his struggling childhood.  These past images haunt him through the whole film, namely his brother's early death.  All of the shown glimpses show how he began his life journey where the film begins.These scenes and events are written beautifully.  Between the two simultaneous timelines, the film flows smoothly.  It successfully distinguishes his music often played in whole and his personal life without any major distractions.  Therefore, this is not just a musician ""biopic"".  It's a drama.  Few other films have accomplished this difficult task to this magnitude (""Amedeus"", 1984).  This film gives Ray Charles the recognition he deserves as a musician and a person.  Led by director Taylor Hackford, the series of events remain entertaining, yet heartfelt in certain scenes.  Such quality proves that the fifteen years of struggling to create this film was worth the wait.  The emotional stance continually builds, leading to a powerful conclusion.Words cannot describe Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  His mannerisms and appearance resemble exactly Charles's, ranging the performances style to the reaction of excitement to the speaking tone to the heroin reaction.  Therefore, watching Foxx is just like watching Ray Charles.  This difficult task proved well researched since he never leaves his ""Ray Charles mode"".  Occassionally does a film feature an actor portraying a real-life figure maintain their preciseness.  Though the actual Charles sings in the film, he expresses his own musical passion through the film.  The crew couldn't have hired a better actor for this role.  This truly was the performance of 2004 and of his career.  His hard work before and during filming paid off.Though Foxx's performance is the main showcase, the other actors also portray their roles beautifully.  Through drug addiction, heartbreak, financial struggle, and betrayal, the actors' talents take this film to further emotional stance.  Some supporting roles could have received an Oscar nomination without complaints from the critics, namely Kerry Washington and Regina King.The costume design and the make-up are accurate to the mid-1900's styles.  Jamie Foxx's appearance amazingly resembles Ray Charles to the degree that viewers often difficulty distinguishing the two.  Many characters, especially the women, could be mistaken as actual 1950's footage because of the make-up, the wardrobes, and the hairstyles.  The costumes also resemble Charles's actual suits worn on stage.Such overall film quality makes ""Ray"" unforgettable viewing experience.  The DVD is a great essential for any Ray Charles or Jamie Foxx fans as it will surely please its audiences for a long time.  Other material that film fans may like are Ray Charles's final album ""Genius Loves Company"" and the ""Ray"" Sountrack.",5,The One And Only Ray Charles,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3438,"['Ray', 'released', '2004', 'garnered', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'critics', 'quality', 'film', 'well-deserved', 'earning', 'seven', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winning', 'two', 'Best', 'Sound', 'Mixing', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Clifton', 'Powell', 'others', 'film', 'life', 'times', 'legendary', 'musician', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'how', 'changed', 'music', 'history', 'songs', 'piano', 'vocals', 'grueling', 'work', 'schedule', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'multiple', 'sex', 'partners', 'racism', 'blindness', 'life', 'obsticle', 'wonderfully', 'Meanwhile', 'struggling', 'childhood', 'past', 'images', 'haunt', 'whole', 'film', 'namely', 'brother', 'early', 'death', 'shown', 'glimpses', 'show', 'how', 'began', 'life', 'journey', 'where', 'film', 'begins.These', 'scenes', 'events', 'are', 'written', 'beautifully', 'Between', 'two', 'simultaneous', 'timelines', 'film', 'smoothly', 'successfully', 'music', 'often', 'played', 'whole', 'personal', 'life', 'major', 'distractions', 'Therefore', 'not', 'just', 'musician', 'biopic', 'drama', 'Few', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'accomplished', 'difficult', 'task', 'magnitude', 'Amedeus', '1984', 'film', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'recognition', 'musician', 'person', 'Led', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'series', 'events', 'remain', 'entertaining', 'yet', 'heartfelt', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Such', 'quality', 'fifteen', 'years', 'struggling', 'create', 'film', 'was', 'wait', 'emotional', 'stance', 'continually', 'leading', 'powerful', 'conclusion.Words', 'can', 'not', 'describe', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'mannerisms', 'appearance', 'resemble', 'exactly', 'Charles', 'ranging', 'performances', 'style', 'reaction', 'excitement', 'speaking', 'tone', 'heroin', 'reaction', 'Therefore', 'watching', 'Foxx', 'just', 'watching', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'difficult', 'task', 'proved', 'well', 'researched', 'never', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'mode', 'Occassionally', 'film', 'feature', 'actor', 'portraying', 'real-life', 'figure', 'maintain', 'preciseness', 'actual', 'Charles', 'sings', 'film', 'own', 'musical', 'passion', 'film', 'crew', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hired', 'better', 'actor', 'role', 'truly', 'was', 'performance', '2004', 'career', 'hard', 'work', 'before', 'filming', 'paid', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'main', 'showcase', 'other', 'actors', 'also', 'portray', 'roles', 'beautifully', 'drug', 'addiction', 'heartbreak', 'financial', 'struggle', 'betrayal', 'actors', 'talents', 'take', 'film', 'further', 'emotional', 'stance', 'supporting', 'roles', 'could', 'have', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'complaints', 'critics', 'namely', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Regina', 'King.The', 'costume', 'design', 'make-up', 'are', 'accurate', 'mid-1900', 'styles', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'appearance', 'amazingly', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'degree', 'viewers', 'often', 'difficulty', 'distinguishing', 'two', 'Many', 'characters', 'especially', 'women', 'could', 'be', 'mistaken', 'actual', '1950', 'footage', 'make-up', 'wardrobes', 'hairstyles', 'costumes', 'also', 'resemble', 'Charles', 'actual', 'suits', 'worn', 'stage.Such', 'overall', 'film', 'quality', 'Ray', 'unforgettable', 'viewing', 'experience', 'DVD', 'great', 'essential', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'fans', 'will', 'surely', 'please', 'audiences', 'long', 'time', 'Other', 'material', 'film', 'fans', 'may', 'like', 'are', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'final', 'album', 'Genius', 'Company', 'Ray', 'Sountrack']",Ray

Despite the fact he is blind and black, he convinces them to give him a chance. They are astonished to see a blind man play the piano so well.He finally reaches his destination of Seattle, and is forced to play in a talent night when one of the participants falls sick. Despite being unprepared he is persuaded to perform, after being tricked into taking drugs to calm him down. The audience stare in amazement, and immediately, he is snapped up by the owner and becomes his manager... as well as his lover.Ray and his band start to sell out on every gig they play, however, he is set back by a childhood nightmare. He feels he is surrounded by water, which causes Ray great pain. Despite this, Ray continues to sell out, and before long he is spotted b a big record company, who offer him a deal. However, his manager isnt too kean to let her biggest money earner go. His manager seems to be hiding something from Ray about the deal, so he decides to speak to the record label himself, and finds his manager has been lting to him about the deal. In a moment of fury he leaves and travels the country with his new band and manager. However, drugs get the better of him, and despite recently becoming maried, he still has th urge to sleep with other women, even with a baby on the way. His ever growing heroin use leads the police to raid his room. No the only way for Ray to stay out of prison is to undergo rehabilitation and completely rid himself of heroin use.During his rehabilitation, we find that the reason for his flashbacks is because his brother drounds as a youngster, and he feels he is to blame as he could have saved his. He continually sobs thinking of how he could have saved his beloved brother, and the constant crying and rubbing his eyes leads to Ray becoming blind.Ray contyinues to become better and better as an artist, and because of this, his wealth grows and grows. We later find out his secret lover dies.""Ray"" is a hearwarming story, and his fears of blaming himself for his brothers death is put straight when he sees his mother and his brother in a dream, where his brother denies Ray is to blame. Also, he receives a public apology from his home town of Georgia who abnned him after he refused to perform there due to racist problems.""Ray"" is an enthrilling movie which is likely to attract all age roups. This true life story is a dedication to Mr Ray Charles who died in 2004, and Jamie Foxx's representation of him is outstanding.

Charles' younger brother's tragic drowning death (in a difficult-to-watch scene) and his mother wanting to run and help him whenever he fell down are unbelievably poignant.  The scene at the end when he takes off his sunglasses and can see his late mother and brother as they were are especially emotional.  I didn't know he'd had a problem with heroin, and this film does not glamourize it.

629322,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B00005JND5,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 2]","""Hit the road, Jack!  And dontcha come back no more, no more, no more, no more!  Hit the road, Jack!  And dontcha came back no more.""Funny that no one would dare say such a line toward to a guy like Ray Charles.~REVIEW~Who WAS Ray Charles?  What are the songs he produced?  What's his profile?  The only thing I knew about him is that he invented a new kind of music, and that he was an inspiration to many music artists everywhere.  However, with this movie that came out, those questions should be easily explained in cinema.  Not only does this movie explained the history, but it does it in soulful and energetic way that's gonna rock the Apollo theater.  The movie name says it all, and says it with respect...""Ray.""Biography movies are synonymous in the movie industry, and almost each keep following the same chronologically approach that makes it seem effective:  Tina Turner, Selena, Nixon, and Ed Wood, the movies that were about these people's lives follow the same device.  ""Ray"" fortunately goes on a different direction, in that this movie isn't about the life and death of Ray Charles Robinson, but about how he became a huge success during all that turmoil.  From the early 50s to late 70s, he goes from working at a lowbrow bar in the South (the bar that also had WILLOW!), to having recording deals from Atlantic and ABC, to being banned from Georgia for not playing in a segregated theater.  During these events, along with other events that happened, he was crippling his life on weed and syringes, before he was arrested.""Ray"" is great with its effective use of time-shifting.  Whenever there's a certain scene that plays an integral role, it shifts back to a past scenario when Ray was just young child living with a single ma' in a poverty area in Florida.  Each past scenario covers the inspirations on his life, and also, unfortunately for him, his tragedies, but all are just captivating to watch.  In one past scenario, Ray was just blind and when fell down in the house, he cried for his mother's help, while his mother was standing right in front of him 6 feet away, doing nothing.  From then, he started to rely on his other senses, and he got up, and experimented the sound and touch, listening to the noise of a cricket and feeling the things surrounding him.  He noticed mom from the sound of her weeping, crying because he had a special gift.  The scene was so touching, I had trouble bottling in my emotions.  The past tragedies kept robbing him out of his sanity in this movie's present and it was these devastating memories that led him to experiment drugs, damaging him in mind and body.On the plus side, Ray is a interesting and funny fellow.  He has his way of getting attention and getting the respect he deserves.  It's funny how he also has his way with the ladies...let's just say it's all in the wrist (literally).  What a heartthrob.  Improvisation is Ray's special niche, because when he gets into a bad situation or got a problem with someone, he just turns these annoyances into song, and he made a lot of great hits improvising.  Ray taught me a good lesson:  it doesn't matter if you're blind, you're no different from the others; you're either act positive or act negative.  With Ray, this movie show him not as a blind guy with talent, but a guy with talent.For some reason, Jamie Foxx is having his best year.  He kicked A when he's in ""Collateral"", and here, he's wonderful portraying as the recently-departed Ray Charles.  I'm surprised how a comedian like him can do so well when transitioned into drama.  He capture the stature and functionally of the icon so tightly, and he's very involved within the character's role.  Another funny thing I realized is that after watching the credits, it list some of the Ray Charles songs in which Foxx actually sang, written by the man himself.  Who knew Foxx had the soul of a singer in him?  While I can remember their names, the remaining cast were all great too.  Like every biography of its type, ""Ray"" includes the original songs, and Ray Charles's songs, such as ""What`d I Say"" and ""Hit the Road Jack"", really brought in some validity to this film.THE FINAL WORD: Astonishing.  I first had no interest in ""Ray"" since it's already been critically-acclaimed and I thought this wouldn't really leave me much of what's already been criticized.  My god, how come I didn't see this sooner?  Other than a few editing mistakes ""Ray"" was a flaw-less true-story movie: it was funny, it left me in tears, it was full of character and optimism.  This is possibly the best film I've seen in 2004, and I hope this movie deserves an Oscar nomination; it's also one of those rare black drama cinemas that actually make me feel good instead of feeling depressed.  If the inventor of soul was alive right now, he probably would've been amazed by this tribute.You did good, Jack.

Not only did he get a nomination for his excellent work in ""Collateral"" for Best Supporting Actor, but I know now that he is a lock for Best Actor in ""Ray.""  From the television previews alone I thought he would get a nomination, but now that I've seen his performance in ""Ray,"" well...there is no doubt at all that he will win.  The best parts of this film include Jamie Foxx in a tour-de-force performance, the music itself (which is elegantly staged), but also the highly underrated direction from Taylor Hackford.  Taylor Hackford richly deserves his Oscar-nomination for Best Director.  While it is true that the film does adhere to conventional storytelling techniques a little too often to make this film a seemless biopic, where the second half of Ray Charles life is basically hashed and fed to the audience in the final ten minutes of the film, what is shown here is often mesmerizing and enthralling.  The only real filmmaking flaw, as far as technical aspects are concerned, come in the form of the stylized film editing.  Some of the cuts include a circle of the next scene gradually becoming larger until it fills the whole screen, or the classic peel-away effect that shows a scene right on the heels of the one that just ended (a technique George Lucas used often in ""Star Wars"").  While these effects work occasionally, if they are used too much, as is the case in ""Ray"" it becomes noticable.  I would lose myself in Jamie Foxx's performance only to be reminded by the director that I am watching a movie via an over-used editing technique.  One edit he uses is actually very effective, where the camera slowly goes dark before the next scene begins.  At those times I felt I was inside Ray's head.  The best parts of the film more than make up for the mistakes; Taylor Hackford has enough inspired moments to merit his Oscar-nomination, the music is rendered beautifully, and Jamie Foxx is simply amazing.  The best compliment any actor can receive, I think, is that while watching his movie you forget he is an actor and completely believe he is the character being portrayed.  In this movie Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.

The film Ray details Ray Charles early years and his career rise and the many struggles that he went through in both his personal and professional life. Actor Jamie Foxx won a Golden Globe award for his amazing role as Ray Charles. Jamie Foxx really did become Ray Charles for this film. The film also stars Regina King (Jerry McGuire, A Cinderella Story), Clifton Powell (Woman Thou Art Loosed, Sugar Valentine), Larenz Tate (Why Do Fools Fall In Love), and other wonderful actors.The DVD is very impressive. The DVD case is enclosed in a shiny color protective slip cover. The DVD itself includes two discs. Upon opening the case you might not notice that there are two discs, but yes, the second disc in in there. Disc one includes the theatrical version and an extended version not shown in theaters. There are a few extras on the first disc but the bulk of the extras are on disc 2.Disc two is filled with a plethora of extra's and bonus material. The most moving bonus feature is Walking In Hist Shoes. This is a revealing look at Jamie Foxx's transformation into Ray Charles. There is also a short little scene where you see Ray and Jamie at the piano. It's moving to see the two together. This short will also let the people know who were not aware that Ray Charles endorsed this film and Jamie Foxx portraying him. Ray Remembered is another bonus feature-but it's too short!

A great deal about ""Ray"" that we may have been unaware of is exposed on the screen, for better or worse. However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated. He transcended barriers of all kinds which with the aid of his perserverance, and personality which was all made possible by his priceless musical gift.-----*- AS GOOD A MUSIC VIDEO AS THERE IS *-----*The biopic about a very special human being who created terrificlly popular, though demonized by some, American music that the entire world came to appreciate. If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music. Hpwever, the film is much more than that. ""Ray"" is about the struggle of Ray Charles, from early childhood blindness to the difficulty of coping with the pressures of his ambition and his desires. He also had to deal with being blind and black, as well as the exploitation that this lent itself too. There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self-indulgences and his convictions too.All in all, ""Ray"" depicts that life was not easy for Ray Charles. Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness. He had faults, but for the most part he confronted his demons, and kept himself from becoming a tragic figure. In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set. He aimed high, and he reached that goal, and then he cleaned-up his act on a personal level, which is very much to his credit.----- THE ACTORS - THE PRODUCTION CREW - THE MAJOR AWARDS ------ THE ACTORS ------*- Jamie Foxx - Ray Charles-----*- Kerry Washington - Della Charles-----*- Regina King - Margie Hendrix-----*- Clifton Powell - Jeff Brown-----*- Aunjanue Ellis - Mary Ann Fisher-----*- Harry J.

629335,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00005JND5,Earl Hazell,"[0, 1]","A couple of things I'd like to point out about this film:=Ray Charles' struggles with heroin, and the effect it had on his personality and those who loved him, is legendary.  In one opportunity to see him and his orchestra perform in New York that I unfortunately had to miss years ago, a friend of mine said you could hear him almost cursing out his band members from several rows away while playing on stage--this I can only assume long after he kicked the heroin habit for good.  The fact that Taylor Hackford chose not to sugarcoat a considerable portion of this attests to not just his respect for his craft, but also to his incredible respect for this legend that was and is Ray Charles.His touch--literally and figuratively--with women was also magnificently captured, as well as the grief and angst it caused his long suffering but deeply loving--and very smart--wife, who had a better idea of what she was getting into than any woman outside of the circle of such experience could probably understand.His long standing friendship with the genius Quincy Jones was also well symbolized, as was their mutual evolutions as men and artists.All of this is so important because, given the context of the breadth of his genius and his unimaginable level of courage, one would otherwise forget that Ray Charles was actually human--partialy thanks to a performance by Jamie Foxx that at times leaves the level of brilliant and goes straight to downright eerie.The cinematography for this movie was beautiful.  The ensemble cast of actors were incredible--especially Ray's mother, who has this as her first movie role.  The costumes were thrilling; a fact easy to forget considering how well they made you forget you weren't actually in the concert halls and joints where it is taking place.  The screenplay was wonderfully dramatic without being preachy or documentary-like in a sneeky way.You walk away from this movie in awe of Ray Charles...and then only sometime after you prepare to put this DVD away while reading the credits are you reminded that you were watching Jamie Foxx portraying Ray Charles.You will want to own this one.",5,Ladies and Gentlemen: Mr. Jamie Foxx,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2135,"['couple', 'things', ""'d"", 'like', 'point', 'out', 'film', '=Ray', 'Charles', 'struggles', 'heroin', 'effect', 'had', 'personality', 'who', 'loved', 'legendary', 'one', 'opportunity', 'see', 'orchestra', 'perform', 'New', 'York', 'unfortunately', 'had', 'miss', 'years', 'ago', 'friend', 'mine', 'said', 'could', 'hear', 'almost', 'cursing', 'out', 'band', 'members', 'several', 'rows', 'away', 'playing', 'stage', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'long', 'kicked', 'heroin', 'habit', 'good', 'fact', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'chose', 'not', 'sugarcoat', 'considerable', 'portion', 'attests', 'not', 'just', 'respect', 'craft', 'also', 'incredible', 'respect', 'legend', 'was', 'Ray', 'Charles.His', 'touch', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'women', 'was', 'also', 'magnificently', 'captured', 'as', 'well', 'grief', 'angst', 'caused', 'long', 'suffering', 'deeply', 'loving', 'very', 'smart', 'wife', 'who', 'had', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'woman', 'circle', 'such', 'experience', 'could', 'probably', 'understand.His', 'long', 'standing', 'friendship', 'genius', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'symbolized', 'was', 'mutual', 'evolutions', 'men', 'artists.All', 'so', 'important', 'given', 'context', 'breadth', 'genius', 'unimaginable', 'level', 'courage', 'one', 'would', 'otherwise', 'forget', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'actually', 'human', 'partialy', 'thanks', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'times', 'level', 'brilliant', 'straight', 'downright', 'eerie.The', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'was', 'beautiful', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'actors', 'were', 'incredible', 'especially', 'Ray', 'mother', 'who', 'first', 'movie', 'role', 'costumes', 'were', 'thrilling', 'fact', 'easy', 'forget', 'considering', 'how', 'well', 'made', 'forget', 'were', ""n't"", 'actually', 'concert', 'halls', 'joints', 'where', 'taking', 'place', 'screenplay', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'dramatic', 'being', 'preachy', 'documentary-like', 'sneeky', 'way.You', 'walk', 'away', 'movie', 'awe', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'then', 'only', 'sometime', 'prepare', 'put', 'DVD', 'away', 'reading', 'credits', 'are', 'reminded', 'were', 'watching', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'portraying', 'Ray', 'Charles.You', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'one']",Ray

629338,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00005JND5,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[2, 3]","""Ray,"" Taylor Hackford's new movie based on the life of the great Ray Charles, is a strange blend.  I liked some aspects of this film very much.  Other parts gave me a bad case of the biopic blues.The flashbacks that depict Ray's childhood as a poor, fatherless boy living in Florida with his mother and his brother are wrenching and heartbreaking.  Sharon Warren, as Ray's mother Aretha, is a standout.  She is a formidable individual who rejects self-pity and never allows Ray to feel sorry for himself, even after he loses his sight.  CJ Sanders, as young Ray, has an incredibly expressive face that speaks volumes.  I also admired the beautiful Kerry Washington as Ray's long-suffering wife, Della Bea, a woman who stands by her man, although he betrays her time and time again.By now, most people know that Jamie Foxx will probably be Oscar nominated for his uncanny, dead-on performance as Ray Charles.  Foxx exhibits all of Charles's physical quirks and captures the nuances of his personality, including his unique musical genius, tremendous ambition, manipulative and predatory behavior towards the women in his life, and his self-destructive drug habit.  For every moment of this film, Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  Period.  The glorious music of Ray Charles permeates the film and I still can't get ""Hit the Road Jack"" out of my head.There were other portions of this film that irritated me.  Taylor Hackford bears much of the blame for some of the clunky and heavy-handed lines, and the absurd, over-the-top sequences that seem to spring straight out of a forties movie.  The worst of these are the ""Aha!"" moments when Charles suddenly gets an inspiration out of nowhere, and his producers all sit around grinning from ear to ear, agreeing that this is the sound that will make them all rich.  There is too much foreshadowing and melodrama, and the direction and cinematography sometimes lack the subtlety that would have made ""Ray"" a truly great movie.Still, you should see ""Ray"" for the three or four very fine performances and for the superb music.  These alone are worth the price of admission.",4,Ray was one of a kind.,1100131200,"11 11, 2004",2004,2108,"['Ray', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'new', 'movie', 'based', 'life', 'great', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'strange', 'blend', 'liked', 'aspects', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Other', 'parts', 'gave', 'bad', 'case', 'biopic', 'blues.The', 'flashbacks', 'depict', 'Ray', 'childhood', 'poor', 'fatherless', 'boy', 'living', 'Florida', 'mother', 'brother', 'are', 'wrenching', 'heartbreaking', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'Ray', 'mother', 'Aretha', 'standout', 'formidable', 'individual', 'who', 'self-pity', 'never', 'Ray', 'feel', 'sorry', 'even', 'sight', 'CJ', 'Sanders', 'young', 'Ray', 'incredibly', 'expressive', 'face', 'volumes', 'also', 'admired', 'beautiful', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Ray', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Della', 'Bea', 'woman', 'who', 'man', 'time', 'time', 'again.By', 'now', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'uncanny', 'dead-on', 'performance', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Foxx', 'Charles', 'physical', 'quirks', 'nuances', 'personality', 'including', 'unique', 'musical', 'genius', 'tremendous', 'ambition', 'manipulative', 'predatory', 'behavior', 'women', 'life', 'self-destructive', 'drug', 'habit', 'moment', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Period', 'glorious', 'music', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'film', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'head.There', 'were', 'other', 'portions', 'film', 'irritated', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'much', 'blame', 'clunky', 'heavy-handed', 'lines', 'absurd', 'over-the-top', 'sequences', 'seem', 'spring', 'straight', 'forties', 'movie', 'worst', 'are', 'Aha', 'moments', 'when', 'Charles', 'suddenly', 'inspiration', 'nowhere', 'producers', 'sit', 'grinning', 'ear', 'ear', 'agreeing', 'sound', 'will', 'make', 'rich', 'too', 'much', 'foreshadowing', 'melodrama', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'sometimes', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'Ray', 'truly', 'great', 'movie.Still', 'should', 'see', 'Ray', 'three', 'four', 'very', 'fine', 'performances', 'superb', 'music', 'alone', 'are', 'worth', 'price', 'admission']",Ray

629341,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B00005JND5,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 4]","At this point, it seems superfluous to say Jamie Foxx gives a brilliant, surprisingly nuanced performance as Ray Charles, as he not only mimics the singer's mannerisms flawlessly but also provides texture and depth to the pained man underneath. It's startling to see Foxx perform at the piano in that idiosyncratic spasmodic style that Charles had, as the actor very often becomes indistinguishable from the legend. In the private moments also depicted here, Foxx is amazingly perceptive about the troubled, hard-shelled, often nasty man Charles apparently was in real life. Hardly the image one remembers from the Pepsi commercials or his other frequent, sometimes ridiculous TV appearances...anyone remember he was in several episodes of ""The Nanny""?But the movie is not about the deconstruction of Ray Charles. In fact, director/writer Taylor Hackford and co-writer James L. White have written a literate, often powerful screenplay that makes us understand the complexity behind Charles' genius and the reasons for his inner demons. The challenge is that in order to remain true to his life story, Hackford and White have overstuffed the movie with so many milestone moments that it becomes episodic and sometimes rather wearing, especially when it comes to the film's depiction of Charles' two-decade heroin addiction. The sight of Charles shooting up and denying his addiction becomes almost a repetitive plot device, as if to provide melodramatic filler between the triumphant moments when he conquers musical frontiers that initially meet with resistance. That's not to say there aren't strong, compelling moments, as there are many. Ironically, one of the most memorable has nothing to do with Foxx but depicts a moment in Charles' hardscrabble Georgia childhood when little Ray trips over a chair and screams for his mother. Wordlessly, he picks himself up and becomes attuned to the sounds around him, picking up a cricket and realizing his mother is right in front of him. It's a transcendent moment.Hackford is not the most subtle of filmmakers (he made the over-the-top ""The Devil's Advocate"" among others), and unfortunately his exaggerated sense of melodrama creeps in now and then, in particular, the last section when he decides to go for a 1960's movie-style approach to drug rehabilitation and inserts a fantasy scene back to Charles' childhood that provides pat closure to his long-standing issues.  It's an oddly surreal Hollywood-style scene that I feel betrays the honesty of what was presented before. But sometimes Hackford's excessiveness works in his favor, as in the supposedly improvised way that classics like ""What'd I Say?"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack"" were composed. I also think he does an effective job in making racism an inherent part of the story, not just a pointed plot device, specifically in showing how much of the manipulation Charles experienced in his career was not at the hands of white promoters. The movie also highlights Charles' decision not to play an unsegregated venue in Georgia and revisits that decision in a coda that takes place years later.Beyond Foxx, there is a gallery of superlative performances, especially by a trio of fine actresses. Kerry Washington is superb as Charles' wife Della Bea providing strength and tolerance in the face of her husband's drug addiction and constant adultery.  Regina King plays backup singer Margie Hendricks, Charles' on-the-road mistress, with her requisite sass but with a penetrating desperation. Best of all is Sharon Warren, who portrays Charles' proud mother Aretha in flashbacks that make you understand where Charles got his courage and unbridled fury. Also providing excellent support are C.J. Sanders as the young Ray, who witnesses his young brother's accidental drowning and faces his impending blindness, and Clifton Powell as Charles' right-hand man Jeff Brown. The more well-known figures are played gamely though less memorably by Larenz Tate as an ambitious, very young Quincy Jones; Curtis Armstrong as an overly measured Ahmet Ertegun; and Richard Schiff as an anxious Jerry Wexler. At 153 minutes, the movie is rather long, and because of its episodic nature, stops rather abruptly in 1966 when Charles' personal and private lives seem to gain equilibrium. Regardless, the wondrous Foxx elevates this film biopic into something quite extraordinary.The two-disc DVD package has several extras worth noting. On the first disc, the chief addition is fourteen scenes deleted in the theatrical version that have been spliced into the version here and notated accordingly. Some provide interesting context to the story, though they sometimes slow the pacing, a problem coupled by the addition of dead pauses that hurt the overall quality of the viewing experience. All told, the extended version clocks in at a staggering 178 minutes. Taylor Hackford's commentary on the alternate audio track is informative but on the perfunctory side (I only wish Foxx could have added his perspective and can only dream what Charles could have contributed had he lived long enough to ""see"" the film's release.) On the second disc, those fourteen deleted scenes show up individually, and there are also three featurettes. The first is the obligatory making-of short, ""A Look Inside Ray"", which includes comments by the filmmakers and actors on making the film.  The next short, ""Walking in His Shoes"", is about the meeting between Foxx and Charles before his death and discusses how Foxx got under the skin of the character. The last, ""Ray Remembered"", is a quick tribute to the spirit of Charles by those who loved and admired him.",4,"Superlative Performances Elevate Solid, Episodic Biopic",1116201600,"05 16,

""Ray"" does what all deserving Best Picture nominees should: it blends the art of a fantastic director with the raw power of a dynamite actor, then paints the story in subtle hues of emotion and color.I've always appreciated the music of Ray Charles, but this film took me behind the scenes to experience the heartache and courage that fueled his soul.  Using flashbacks to perfection, the director allows us to feel the guilt of Ray's childhood, as well as the backbone that his mother fostered in him.  Using every nuance of voice and movement, Jamie Foxx takes us into the mind of this legendary man.  The movie never glorifies the drugs or womanizing of Ray Charles; it shows them in an honest, often painful, but ultimately liberating light.  I was moved to laughter, tears, and applause.With Oscar night coming up, I can't resist praising this great film before the Academy has its say.

Did I really care about a musical genius who was a musical innovator and later a force against segregation (who also happened to be blind) struggled against inferior treatment (first because of his blindness, second because of his race)? Did I care that he succumbed to the same demons that afflict many entertainers (infidelity/womanizing and heavy drug use/addiction)? On the surface, no, none of this is particularly noteworthy. However, Ray Charles, for all his very human faults, loved, lived and breathed music and changed the face of music and was a pioneer in the music industry (both from the standpoint of being a shrewd, cutthroat businessman and from the standpoint of defying musical barriers and traditional lines between musical genres). He started out from humble beginnings but used his talents to climb from this ""station"" and used his hard won experience (being cheated, being treated differently because of his handicap and/or his race). He could easily have been defeated, but he had talent and drive and a shrewdness born of bitter experience and of being wronged one too many times. Unfortunately, his shrewdness crossed over into his indiscriminate choices in his personal life, but this does not appear to have affected his professional life in the least. He succeeded and thrived against all odds, making state of the art deals for himself, forging his own way in the business, doing what he wanted to do. Unfortunately, as this biopic, handled expertly in the hands of director Taylor Hackford, his music did come at a price for others. Charles's long-suffering wife and a long string of other jilted lovers suffered a great deal at his hands.The truly remarkable part of this film is not only that it tells a story of such a gifted man who had a sense of self and a sense of what he wanted to do (that led to great success) but that it was possible to make a film that so exactly captured the essence of this man. Jamie Foxx was a revelation; his astounding likeness to Ray Charles (in appearance, mannerisms) created a deeply authentic feel, which made one forget they were watching someone else playing Charles. This WAS Ray Charles reincarnated in a sense. Personally I did not know Jamie Foxx had it in him; I knew he was talented as an actor but had no idea he possessed this kind of gravity and versatility. Having seen all the films for which actors were Oscar-nominated for their roles this year, Foxx unequivocally was the hands-down winner with very tough competition. His performance, though, was in a league somewhere far above the performances given by the other actors.

But this is not the great performance that critics are falling over themselves to praise.  Like Will Smith in &quot;Ali&quot;, Foxx's &quot;depth&quot; is shown by having him be stoic while all around him better actors perform.The basis of Ray Caharles' powerful inner demons are revealed through a series of flashbacks, but what the viewer is left with is a feeling that the guy is a basically irredeemable jerk who - for a decade and a half - produced great music.The movie is way too long and Charles' treatment of those around him left me feeling cold towards him.  What remains is a series of laughably executed scenes (particularly weak is the montage of Ray's &quot;announcer&quot; and road manager introducing him in a variety of foreign languages).Even with the length of &quot;Ray&quot;, the story ends abruptly.  Ray Charles struggles to kick heroin and then lives happily ever after.  This despite the fact that Ray Charles spent the last 3 decades of his life touring as a &quot;golden oldie&quot; type act.I don't understand the hype on this film.

My wife and I (about 6 years ago) used to buy used (pre-viewed) discs from Blockbuster Stores. Remember them? Well, this one has a sticker and shows the price as 14.99 for a used disc! Hard to believe.In any case, it's a very good movie and I watched the version that was shown in theaters. Perhaps some day I'll also watch the extended version and the rest of the extra material that comes with the movie. There's two packed discs. The movie follows the life and career of Ray Charles from childhood to death. One is the story of his childhood which runs from his birth up to about when he becomes an entertainer. The other story is of his history as an entertainer. The two stories are overlapped such that the viewer will switch back and forth. It's a little unusual, but works rather well.I had a major part of my personal musical development in the span from about 1952 to 1959. It was the time of the birth of Rock and Roll and I just loved it! R & R was not a genre as yet during those early days and it was kinda a loose collection of things that didn't fit too well anywhere else. There were elements of gospel, country, rhythm and blues, pop, jazz and novelty tunes all bunched together. If it was somewhat brash, had a strong beat and was offensive to the common populace, it was called Rock and Roll and played only in limited places and on limited radio stations. You had to be a R & R fan to keep track of  what was going on. But it was worth it.Ray Charles fit into this early R & R grouping and he became renowned for his wonderful songs such as ""Baby, What I'd Say"" and ""Hit The Road Jack"" and many others. It was a wonderful period and living it helps a lot. I liked Charles 50s music best. When he drifted into country and pop and had difficulties with drugs and his record company, my interest fell off and I was enjoying other artists.I enjoyed the early part of the movie the most, the part that covered the fifties. When it went into the change of record companies and change in style to country, and all the marital and drug problems, my interest in the movie fell off, just as my interest in his music had done decades earlier. However, it's an essential part of the movie and well worth viewing if you want the whole story of Ray Charles.In any case, it was an excellent movie. Very well done. And the music is wonderful. Surely this one must have picked up a bundle of awards and other accolades. It's one of those kinds of movies, without question.Gary Peterson",5,A Great Movie Of A Legendary Musician's Life And Career..,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,2626,"['late', 'night', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'was', 'Ray', 'story', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'found', 'DVD', 'shelves', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'while', 'wife', '6', 'years', 'ago', 'used', 'buy', 'used', 'pre-viewed', 'discs', 'Blockbuster', 'Stores', 'Remember', 'Well', 'one', 'sticker', 'price', '14.99', 'used', 'disc', 'Hard', 'believe.In', 'case', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'watched', 'version', 'was', 'shown', 'theaters', 'Perhaps', 'day', ""'ll"", 'also', 'watch', 'extended', 'version', 'rest', 'extra', 'material', 'movie', 'two', 'packed', 'discs', 'movie', 'life', 'career', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'childhood', 'death', 'One', 'story', 'childhood', 'birth', 'up', 'when', 'entertainer', 'other', 'story', 'history', 'entertainer', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'overlapped', 'such', 'viewer', 'will', 'switch', 'back', 'forth', 'little', 'unusual', 'rather', 'well.I', 'had', 'major', 'part', 'personal', 'musical', 'development', 'span', '1952', '1959', 'was', 'time', 'birth', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'just', 'loved', 'R', 'R', 'was', 'not', 'genre', 'yet', 'early', 'days', 'was', 'kinda', 'loose', 'collection', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'too', 'well', 'anywhere', 'else', 'were', 'elements', 'gospel', 'country', 'rhythm', 'blues', 'pop', 'jazz', 'novelty', 'tunes', 'bunched', 'together', 'was', 'somewhat', 'brash', 'had', 'strong', 'beat', 'was', 'offensive', 'common', 'populace', 'was', 'called', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'played', 'only', 'limited', 'places', 'limited', 'radio', 'stations', 'had', 'be', 'R', 'R', 'fan', 'keep', 'track', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'was', 'worth', 'it.Ray', 'Charles', 'fit', 'early', 'R', 'R', 'grouping', 'became', 'renowned', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'such', 'Baby', 'What', ""'d"", 'Say', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'many', 'others', 'was', 'wonderful', 'period', 'living', 'lot', 'liked', 'Charles', '50s', 'music', 'best', 'When', 'drifted', 'country', 'pop', 'had', 'difficulties', 'drugs', 'record', 'company', 'interest', 'fell', 'off', 'was', 'enjoying', 'other', 'artists.I', 'enjoyed', 'early', 'part', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'covered', 'fifties', 'When', 'went', 'change', 'record', 'companies', 'change', 'style', 'country', 'marital', 'drug', 'problems', 'interest', 'movie', 'fell', 'off', 'just', 'interest', 'music', 'had', 'done', 'decades', 'earlier', 'However', 'essential', 'part', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'viewing', 'want', 'whole', 'story', 'Ray', 'Charles.In', 'case', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'Very', 'well', 'done', 'music', 'wonderful', 'Surely', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'bundle', 'awards', 'other', 'accolades', 'one', 'kinds', 'movies', 'question.Gary', 'Peterson']",Ray

629359,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00005JND5,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 2]","It has been said that this script has been passed around Hollywood for over a decade. Ray Charles, before he died, personally worked on this project. For this film, despite Jamie Foxx's musical abilities, they used Ray Charles' voice and all the original, albeit remastered, recordings.RAY has been huge at the box office. It did real well at the Golden Globes, and it is expected to do equally as well at the Oscars. The film is more than two and half hours in length, and at times it feels like it. It covered the first turbulent three decades of the life of Ray Charles, from 1933-1966.Ray Charles Robinson was a fighter, and his adversaries were formidable. He had to fight against ""Racism"", as all black entertainers did in the 40's and 50's. In 1961, Charles refused to perform in his home state of Georgia, because black folks were not allowed into the concerts.  He had to fight ""Blindness"", and he probably had glaucoma. He may not have been totally blind, at least not in those early years. He never used a dog guide, or a long white cane. In addition, he had to fight ""Heroin"". He started out like many musicians in the 40's smoking a little weed, and then he graduated to smack, and real addiction. This battle with drugs colored the whole plot. It was presently unflinchingly, unmasked. Ray Charles must have felt that drug addiction was his greatest demon. He also drank way too much, and he was a legendary womanizer. At one point in the credits to the film, it was pointed out that he had 23 children. Some feel that it was a much larger number.Jamie Foxx is incredibly good as Ray Charles. At one point in Foxx's life, he had considered being a concert pianist. He played all the music, and all the close-ups himself. Nothing had to be faked; and he did so while wearing occluder prosthetics that simulated blindness. Foxx spend some time with the actual Ray Charles, but mostly he studied film of the younger version of the man.Foxx did not imitate Ray Charles--he inhabited him. His body movements, far from blindisms or drug-induced twitchs--were more like choreography than mimicry. His swaying and bobbing while playing the music were like using his whole body as a baton, conducting the music. During the musical numbers, one was never aware of lip-synching, because Foxx sang all the songs full out; they just didn't use his voice in the final cuts. So this did not seem like an impersonation. It became almost metaphysical, like the actor was channeling the essence of Ray Charles.One critic wrote,"" Hackford's film is never as good as Foxx's performance--but it is still an ode to the genius of Ray Charles.""  Without Foxx, cerainly the film would have been more pedestrian--but the film has Jamie Foxx, and this elevated it to some level of greatness.",4,"Hit the Road, Jack",1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,2778,"['been', 'said', 'script', 'been', 'passed', 'Hollywood', 'decade', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'died', 'personally', 'worked', 'project', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'musical', 'abilities', 'used', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'voice', 'original', 'albeit', 'remastered', 'recordings.RAY', 'been', 'huge', 'box', 'office', 'did', 'real', 'well', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'expected', 'do', 'equally', 'as', 'well', 'Oscars', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'length', 'times', 'covered', 'first', 'turbulent', 'three', 'decades', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', '1933-1966.Ray', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'was', 'fighter', 'adversaries', 'were', 'formidable', 'had', 'fight', 'Racism', 'black', 'entertainers', 'did', '40', '50', '1961', 'Charles', 'refused', 'perform', 'home', 'state', 'Georgia', 'black', 'folks', 'were', 'not', 'allowed', 'concerts', 'had', 'fight', 'Blindness', 'probably', 'had', 'glaucoma', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'totally', 'blind', 'least', 'not', 'early', 'years', 'never', 'used', 'dog', 'guide', 'long', 'white', 'cane', 'addition', 'had', 'fight', 'Heroin', 'started', 'out', 'many', 'musicians', '40', 'smoking', 'little', 'weed', 'then', 'graduated', 'smack', 'real', 'addiction', 'battle', 'drugs', 'colored', 'whole', 'plot', 'was', 'presently', 'unflinchingly', 'unmasked', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'drug', 'addiction', 'was', 'greatest', 'demon', 'also', 'drank', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'legendary', 'womanizer', 'one', 'point', 'credits', 'film', 'was', 'pointed', 'out', 'had', '23', 'children', 'feel', 'was', 'much', 'larger', 'number.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'incredibly', 'good', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'one', 'point', 'Foxx', 'life', 'had', 'considered', 'being', 'concert', 'pianist', 'played', 'music', 'close-ups', 'Nothing', 'had', 'be', 'faked', 'did', 'so', 'wearing', 'occluder', 'prosthetics', 'simulated', 'blindness', 'Foxx', 'spend', 'time', 'actual', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'mostly', 'studied', 'film', 'younger', 'version', 'man.Foxx', 'did', 'not', 'imitate', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'inhabited', 'body', 'movements', 'far', 'blindisms', 'drug-induced', 'twitchs', 'were', 'more', 'choreography', 'mimicry', 'swaying', 'bobbing', 'playing', 'music', 'were', 'using', 'whole', 'body', 'baton', 'conducting', 'music', 'musical', 'numbers', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'aware', 'lip-synching', 'Foxx', 'sang', 'songs', 'full', 'out', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'voice', 'final', 'cuts', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'impersonation', 'became', 'almost', 'metaphysical', 'actor', 'was', 'channeling', 'essence', 'Ray', 'Charles.One', 'critic', 'wrote', 'Hackford', 'film', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'still', 'ode', 'genius', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Foxx', 'cerainly', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'elevated', 'level', 'greatness']",Ray

629361,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00005JND5,Grady Harp,"[3, 5]","RAY is one of the more media-hyped movies of the year with Oscar predictions all over the ads.  It is always with some misgivings that these movies are visited, admittedly with some resentment that they are pre-judged before a personal opinion can be made.  Such is the case for Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray Charles.  Not that his performance isn't excellent in this movie: the media would have us believe it is the first time this gifted actor has demonstrated his mettle, and that only means that too many folks have forgotten Foxx's powerful performances in such films as COLLATERAL earlier this year.RAY is a Hollywood-style biography and for this reviewer that hampers the story.  Too much attention is paid to the mannerisms of Ray Charles and Jamie Foxx just isn't given enough screen time away from his band and his audience to let us understand why he is an American icon:  it would have been so much richer had we been given insights as to Ray Charles' innovative impact on popular music - the origins, the attempts, the failures, and the successes and why.  Still in all Foxx is in fine form lip-synching Charles' terrific music, writhing in withdrawal from his heroin addiction, and especially showing us the personal tragedy when he hears the news of his lover's death with his wife observing the crushing blow.Which leads to what is the most sensitive aspect of this movie: the women.  Sharon Warren as Ray's poverty-surviving mother is radiant and gives a performance that is overwhelmingly beautiful.  Likewise, Kerry Washington as Bea, Ray's long-suffering yet enduring wife shows us one of the finer supporting roles of the year to date.  And that leaves Regina King as Ray's lover Margie, another of the strong female supporting roles in the film.But by far the 'star' of the film is the music of Ray Charles that is played intact and is simply wonderful on every level.  If all the rest of the film existed merely as background for these great moments in music, that would be sufficient.  With a bit more judicious editing by Director Taylor Hackford this could have been an even better film.

Indeed, after suffering through most of 2 hours worth of watching him shoot up again and again, he goes cold turkey and is done with the stuff in about 10 minutes. It's not the most realistic resolution.Jamie Foxx does indeed give an almost surreal portrayal of Charles in terms of its dead-on accuracy. It's quite literally spooky. (In a ""making of"" bonus feature, Foxx recounts how he would be up all night learning songs so his hand movements would be right and of committing to ""be"" blind while shooting. They used makeup to cover over his eyes and he would work like that for up to 14 hours a day.) As a testament to it, Ray Robinson Junior (Charles' son) said he had to remind himself it was NOT his father at times.As far as special features go, besides the making of featurette, there's a ""Remembering Ray"" feature where musicians including Tony Bennett, Quincy Jones, and Reba McIntire offer their praise for the R&B; legend. Another ""Inside Ray"" feature is mostly the director touting the story of Charles' rags to riches ascendancy.BOTTOM LINE:If you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie, this is probably NOT it. The film shows Charles with all his flaws as a womanizer who got another woman pregnant while his wife stayed home from the road, nearly killed himself with heroin, and attacked bandmembers for frailties he himself was dealing with. (He fires a trumpet player for turning up high.)What you get here is the tale of Charles' PERSONAL triumphs: over racism in the Jim Crow South, over blindness, over addiction, and over the strictures of the music business.

His mother wants to run over and comfort her son, but restrains herself.  She knows that to function in the world he needs to learn independence.  She watches as the boy stops crying, gets up, is fascinated by the sounds around him:  a horse, a cricket.  He follows the cricket's sound and catches it.  His mother cries tears of joy-her son is learning to use his ears as his eyes and has a chance of escaping poverty.In the segregated 1940s, a young black blind musician rides in the back of the bus to get as far from his sharecropper roots in North Florida as he can get in the continental U.S.--to Seattle.  He quickly finds a gig and helps the venue owners make a lot more money than they typically made.  He then discovers they're taking financial advantage of him and he strikes out on his own.In the still-segregated 1950s, the musician, now successful, travels to Georgia to give a performance.  He arrives to a protest:  the segregated venue will only allow white people in his audience.  Reluctantly, he agrees to play.  The white person in charge of setting up the gig tells the main protestor to ""Go home boy!  It's always been segregated and that's the way it's always gonna be!""  Ray immediately changes his mind and refuses to play.  He's banned from performing the state of Georgia for life and sued.  But fortunately segregation ended in his lifetime and the state of Georgia came to its senses...Ray is a POWERFUL movie, extremely well plotted and well acted, with an awesome soundtrack.  I cried in this one more than in Gone With the Wind, Terms of Endearment, and It's a Wonderful Life.  It's that powerful.  Good thing I was watching it at home, b/c I jumped up at times and danced to the soundtrack.  Jamie Foxx earned every bit of his best actor Oscar.  This isn't just an impersonation--he totally became Ray Charles and played the role literally blind.  And he did a chilling, very convincing portrayal of Ray Charles detoxing from heroin.  Foxx's portrayal really helped me understand Ray Charles, the complex and imperfect man behind the genius:  a womanizer who loved his wife, a drug addict who had the strength to overcome his addiction, a savvy negotiator with street smarts, and more.The supporting actors were also impressive including Sharon Warren in her debut performance, who played Ray Charles' mother a poor uneducated but very intelligent ""tough love"" woman who raised her son to become an educated, independent adult.  The child actors who played Ray and his brother George, C.J. Sanders and Terrone Bell did a great job as well.  Ray's childhood interweaves into his adult life via flashbacks, showing how both how his strengths and anxieties originated from those experiences.  This movie really helped me understand Ray Charles the imperfect man behind the musical genius who was able to overcome the hand that was dealt him:  growing up poor, black and blind in the segregated south.IMO, this movie is a must-see!",5,Powerful portrayal of an imperfect genius.

Ray Charles in contrast sees/saw only that part of his life where he could dream of something real and worth holding onto in pictures.Sadly, it takes him back to the deepest wound he ever suffered.The fact that the story and screenplay on this film made me feel Jamie Foxx is the real Ray Charles is alone for me to rank it high.Ray Charles was a man of gritty belief in himself but somehow or somewhere he would run back into those days where he could see as a child.The haunt and absolute feeling of worthlessness he felt never really escaped him. What I gained from this film is that childhood memories last a lifetime but it's only the superhuman who get over those.Pardon my lack of faith in humanity.There were two scenes that made me cry and not surprisingly both were from his sorrowful past.What was however quite amazing about Ray Charles was the lack of any self pity in him. It were the words of his mother that kept him going.Please note, this film is not for short attention span dilletes. It's not for those seeking Spidermans preventing trains from colliding and neither for those who wish to have a good time. It's one I'd recommend mostly to those who wish to look into another person's life. Jamie Foxx has gained a mountain load of appreciation for this role and deservedly so.I think I'm gonna go watch more movies based on people's lives.I wouldn't consider buying Ray simply because it's not something I'd like to watch again.Cheers & a Ray Charle smile..",5,RAY,1115769600,"05 11, 2005",2005,1561,"['Twenty', 'look', 'back', 'life', 'see', 'life', 'pictures', 'more', 'pictures', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'contrast', 'sees/saw', 'only', 'part', 'life', 'where', 'could', 'dream', 'something', 'real', 'worth', 'holding', 'pictures.Sadly', 'back', 'deepest', 'wound', 'ever', 'suffered.The', 'fact', 'story', 'screenplay', 'film', 'made', 'feel', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'real', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'alone', 'rank', 'high.Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'man', 'gritty', 'belief', 'somehow', 'somewhere', 'would', 'run', 'back', 'days', 'where', 'could', 'see', 'child.The', 'haunt', 'absolute', 'feeling', 'worthlessness', 'felt', 'never', 'really', 'escaped', 'What', 'gained', 'film', 'childhood', 'memories', 'last', 'lifetime', 'only', 'superhuman', 'who', 'get', 'those.Pardon', 'lack', 'faith', 'humanity.There', 'were', 'two', 'scenes', 'made', 'cry', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'were', 'sorrowful', 'past.What', 'was', 'however', 'quite', 'amazing', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'lack', 'self', 'pity', 'were', 'words', 'mother', 'kept', 'going.Please', 'note', 'film', 'not', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'not', 'seeking', 'Spidermans', 'preventing', 'trains', 'colliding', 'who', 'wish', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'one', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'mostly', 'who', 'wish', 'look', 'person', 'life', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'gained', 'mountain', 'load', 'appreciation', 'role', 'deservedly', 'so.I', 'think', ""'m"", 'gon', 'go', 'watch', 'more', 'movies', 'based', 'people', 'lives.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'buying', 'Ray', 'simply', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'like', 'watch', 'again.Cheers', 'Ray', 'Charle', 'smile..']",Ray

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[1, 1]","IN A NUTSHELL: GREAT MUSIC BY A MAN WHO LIVED [2-disk WS ed.]Jammie Foxx is absolutely convincing and possesses the essence of the man, Ray Charles, as much as is possible in a biopic. A great deal about ""Ray"" that we may have been unaware of is exposed on the screen, for better or worse. However, no matter what is happening is his life, Ray's music just keeps getting better and better and more widely heard and appreciated. He transcended barriers of all kinds which with the aid of his perserverance, and personality which was all made possible by his priceless musical gift.WHAT IT IS: FOR STARTERS: AS GOOD A MUSIC VIDEO AS THERE IS!The biopic about a very special human being who created terrificlly popular, though demonized by some, American music that the entire world came to appreciate. If this film is nothing else, it is a moving emotional music video of the great music. Hpwever, the film is much more than that. ""Ray"" is about the struggle of Ray Charles, from early childhood blindness to the difficulty of coping with the pressures of his ambition and his desires. He also had to deal with being blind and black, as well as the exploitation that this lent itself too. There was also the personal toll on himself, which was considerable and included some of his self-indulgences and his convictions too.All in all, ""Ray"" depicts that life was not easy for Ray Charles. Yet, he was able to have his music his own way, which of course was the root of his greatness. He had faults, but for the most part he confronted his demons, and kept himself from becoming a tragic figure. In the end, he was winner in every way, and his music will live on forever as will the example he set. He aimed high, and he reached that goal, and then he cleaned-up his act on a personal level, which is very much to his credit.----- THE ACTORS - THE PRODUCTION CREW - THE MAJOR AWARDS ------ THE ACTORS ------*- Jamie Foxx  - Ray Charles-----*- Kerry Washington  - Della Charles-----*- Regina King  - Margie Hendrix-----*- Clifton Powell  - Jeff Brown-----*- Aunjanue Ellis  - Mary Ann Fisher-----*- Harry J.

The acting by practically everyone is flawless; the soundtrack, made up of Ray Charles himself singing, is even better.Born in poverty in rural Georgia, banned from the state for years and finally given the recognition there he deserved, Mr. Charles is a beautiful example of what people can overcome.The film makes no attempt to whitewash the singer's life and does not shy away from either his drug addiction or his marital infidelities. It was heartening to read on the screen, just before the final credits rolled, that Mr. Charles for the next forty years after the period of his life that this movie covers, had his act together and continued to record one beautiful song after another for a grateful public.For the few other Americans like me who just got around to seeing this movie, do not miss it.",5,Not Much New To Add,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,1017,"[""n't"", 'much', 'new', 'add', 'praise', 'been', 'heaped', 'movie', 'deserved', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'course', 'received', 'Oscar', '2004', 'best', 'male', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'acting', 'practically', 'everyone', 'flawless', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'singing', 'even', 'better.Born', 'poverty', 'rural', 'Georgia', 'banned', 'state', 'years', 'finally', 'given', 'recognition', 'there', 'deserved', 'Mr.', 'Charles', 'beautiful', 'example', 'what', 'people', 'can', 'overcome.The', 'film', 'attempt', 'whitewash', 'singer', 'life', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'drug', 'addiction', 'marital', 'infidelities', 'was', 'heartening', 'read', 'screen', 'just', 'final', 'credits', 'rolled', 'Mr.', 'Charles', 'next', 'forty', 'years', 'period', 'life', 'movie', 'had', 'act', 'together', 'continued', 'record', 'one', 'beautiful', 'song', 'grateful', 'public.For', 'few', 'other', 'Americans', 'who', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'seeing', 'movie', 'do', 'not', 'miss']",Ray

If you want to watch a true masterpiece, then watch Hotel Rwanda.But, Ray is a good movie that everyone should see. It portrays Ray Charles's life and showed his many dark secrets. I never knew that he had been like that. He didn't save his brother from death, cheated on his wife, then on the lady who he was cheating with and used many drugs. The movie is hard to watch at times and Jamie Foxx's performance is amazing. It shows all of the downfalls of Ray Charles and his whole life. The movie is also very informative as it informs you on everything in his life. It's kind of like a documentary in a movie form.

629371,A16CZRQL23NOIW,B00005JND5,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[3, 5]","Taylor Hackford is one of the most gifted and prominent directors of the American Cinema. He has given us previously authentic film jewels as Dolores Clairburne, Proof of life and The devils's advocate. So all the possible ephitets for this movie somehow weren't strange to me but confirmed once more my first imnpression of Hackford and his artistic talents.The illumination before all is another hidden actor. Tastefully filmed the secure and masterful direction leads us through three decades. The artistic direction and the set up are impeccable. The film is told in documental stylish and thanks to the multiple flashback, the viewer ellaborates his own readings.The supporting cast is simply superb. The lense never abuses of the close up. Hackford knows to use it as the good conductor with the ""rubato"" figure. In the other hand the script reflects to Ray multidimensionally , this a very remarkable aspect: Ray : the man and his whole circunstamce: many directors could havegiven us a tearful reading and a soap melodram but you fortunately are before a mature film crudely described.Jamie Fox,to my mind, makes an impressive acting and I suspect he will be the real winner the next Sunday in the Academy Award. Fox didn't play Ray Charles character. He simply is Ray , he lived the personae. Evcery little gesture, head movement and nervous tics in challenging and dramatic moments.

That's the first and best aspect of the film we have to emphasize. The music is marvellous and has been in our ears and heads for more than fifty years. The phenomenal mixing and blending of R&B;, blues, gospel, country music and jazz turns Ray Charles into a unique prophet of our musical imagination and world, and that will remain true for at least fifty more years. But the film follows Ray Charles practically from his birth till his death. It shows how he got involved in many deep and fundamental social, cultural, musical and racial movements to change the world when necessary. It shows the personal problems he had to face and solve in order to last in his creativity and humanity, particularly his decision to drop heroin in one single weaning session. It shows how he was able to separate his family life from his professional life, and his wife was able to follow him along this line, so that these two lives never mixed, at least not entirely. But he had an admirable wife. It also shows the great changes that occurred in the USA over the last sixty years, the tremendous reduction of racism and segregation, even the important first steps on the road towards repentance and reparations. The road has not reached its destination yet, but it is coming closer. Finally this film shows the absolute blend of the whole life of a man, and every single moment will remain alive for him forever, and his creativity, here Ray's music. When a man creates something he has to invest every single fiber of his muscles and every single cell of his brain into it to make it his truest ever child. That is what Ray was able to do and he did it over and over again in his long professional life. His decision to refuse to perform in a segregated theater in Georgia and his subsequent ban from Georgia for life was a better thought and felt decision than many other decisions of his in his whole entire life, and yet it was taken on the spur of the moment. That is the sign of a great man and a great mind.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,There is no limit to this music but the sky!,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,2105,"['Ray', 'Charles', 'myth', 'here', 'friend', 'familiar', 'human', 'being', 'first', 'best', 'aspect', 'film', 'have', 'emphasize', 'music', 'marvellous', 'been', 'ears', 'heads', 'more', 'fifty', 'years', 'phenomenal', 'mixing', 'blending', 'R', 'B', 'blues', 'gospel', 'country', 'music', 'jazz', 'turns', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'unique', 'prophet', 'musical', 'imagination', 'world', 'will', 'remain', 'true', 'least', 'fifty', 'more', 'years', 'film', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'practically', 'birth', 'till', 'death', 'how', 'got', 'involved', 'many', 'deep', 'fundamental', 'social', 'cultural', 'musical', 'racial', 'movements', 'change', 'world', 'when', 'necessary', 'personal', 'problems', 'had', 'face', 'solve', 'order', 'last', 'creativity', 'humanity', 'particularly', 'decision', 'drop', 'heroin', 'one', 'single', 'weaning', 'session', 'how', 'was', 'able', 'separate', 'family', 'life', 'professional', 'life', 'wife', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'line', 'two', 'lives', 'never', 'mixed', 'least', 'not', 'entirely', 'had', 'admirable', 'wife', 'also', 'great', 'changes', 'occurred', 'USA', 'last', 'sixty', 'years', 'tremendous', 'reduction', 'racism', 'segregation', 'even', 'important', 'first', 'steps', 'road', 'towards', 'repentance', 'reparations', 'road', 'not', 'reached', 'destination', 'yet', 'coming', 'closer', 'Finally', 'film', 'absolute', 'blend', 'whole', 'life', 'man', 'single', 'moment', 'will', 'remain', 'alive', 'forever', 'creativity', 'here', 'Ray', 'music', 'When', 'man', 'something', 'invest', 'single', 'fiber', 'muscles', 'single', 'cell', 'brain', 'make', 'truest', 'ever', 'child', 'what', 'Ray', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'did', 'over', 'over', 'again', 'long', 'professional', 'life', 'decision', 'refuse', 'perform', 'segregated', 'theater', 'Georgia', 'subsequent', 'ban', 'Georgia', 'life', 'was', 'better', 'thought', 'felt', 'decision', 'many', 'other', 'decisions', 'whole', 'entire', 'life', 'yet', 'was', 'taken', 'spur', 'moment', 'sign', 'great', 'man', 'great', 'mind.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Ray

If you said that, and I know I did, it is even more deserving when you watch the movie.Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a lifetime.  He may never get a role like this again, and if not, who cares?  He will always have this.  The story spans most of Ray Charles' life up to the point where the state of Georgia officially apologized to him for banning him from playing in their borders due to his cancellation of a huge concert because it was segregated.Flashing back to scenes of his childhood, he grew up in a poor working community of blacks in the south.  He took interest in piano as a small boy and was taught by a man in his neighborhood.  Moving swiftly the plot and story shows how he traveled to Seattle and made a name for himself in the blues scene. As he moved up, he encountered racism as well as discrimination for being blind.  Strangely more people seemed to shun him for his blindness rather than his race.As he gained more popularity he struggled to find his `sound'.  He also married and went on the road making a lot of money.  As his wife kept his home and had his children, he toured the country as he slipped deeper into drug use, infidelity and increasingly haunting memories from his childhood where he witnessed his younger brother die and his sight slowly slip away at an early age.The story climaxes with his own realization of what his life had become.  Despite his fame and fortune, his drug use and torturing memories were taking their toll.  Salvation comes the hard way.  Despite it's two and half hour running time, Director Taylor Hackford makes sure the movie moves at a steady pace, never getting too slow or bogging itself down in intellectual over thinking of what the character is feeling.

629385,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JND5,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[0, 1]","I enjoyed this film immensely and was impressed by the entire production. I was also impressed with director Taylor Hackford's choice to balance Ray's personal tragedies and personal life with his music careers. Many musical biographies tend to focus more on the personal side, but 'Ray' lets us into business meetings, contract discussions, label changes and in this film makes Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler important characters in the film. I also liked how the film addressed the groundbreaking musical choices Ray made without being heavy handed.Jamie Foxx truly deserved that Oscar, congratulation. Kerry Washington, Regina King, and Sharon Warren (who plays Ray's mother, Aretha)  performances are just integral to the film because Ray was certainly not a perfect person as the film shows, and their characters each bring out a different side in Ray, and the actors each bring a different side out of Jamie Foxx. Kerry Washington is fabulous as Della Bea, Ray's long suffering and put-upon wife. The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning. Washington is an incredible actress and ""Ray"" lets her shine!Regina King was fantastic on this role. Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face. The ""Hit the Road Jack"" scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues. Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film. Another scene that moved me was when Ray's character is a child and learns to cope with being blind, while his mother observes. It is one of the most striking scenes.The story was very powerful and endearing. It has captured the essence of a true American Icon and legend.

First of all, it hits all the right notes, pun intended, the music is all Ray's and it's great to have so much of it blasting through the speakers of a theater.  That, is only a small reason why this film is as incredible as it is, the main reason I love this film as much as I do is from a performance of a lifetime by Mr. Jaime Foxx, years ago it may have seemed to be a joke that Foxx could pull something like this off, but if he doesn't get noticed by the Academy, something is truly wrong.  The film itself runs at what would normally be a bit too long for some, 2 hours and 33 minutes, but this film flows so smoothly that at no time did I get bored, in fact, by the end I wanted more, a lot more, but when you make a film on someone's life, you gotta end it somewhere, and I feel it covered enough to make it the great film it is.  This is one of the best bio pictures I've seen in a long time, probably since A Beautiful Mind.  Go see Ray, even if you don't consider yourself a fan of Mr. Charles, you may be surprised by the end of the film, and possibly end up buying a few of his cds.

629389,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JND5,Joe Sherry,"[0, 0]","A film by Taylor Hackford""Ray"" is a biopic about the defining period in the life of musician Ray Charles.  While there are flashbacks to Ray's childhood, ""Ray"" mostly deals with the time between when Ray Robinson (Jamie Foxx) was first starting out in the late 1940's through the 1960's when he became a huge success with ""Georgia on my Mind"" and was the first black artist to refuse to play a venue if it was segregated.  With a ringing admonishment to never let the world treat him like a cripple, ""Ray"" begins with Ray Robinson getting onto a bus bound to Seattle from Florida and meeting up with a very young Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate).  If it didn't happen, I wouldn't believe it.  Ray Robinson gets himself an audition at a club and is immediately a hit.  The club's owner becomes his manager for a time and begins to cheat him out of his money from the start.  Time passes until Ray wises up to what is going on and leaves to strike out on his own where he can play and be more in control of his future.""Ray"" features a series of successes where Ray Charles (Charles is the middle name of Ray Robinson, he changed his stage name because there was already a ""Sugar"" Ray Robinson who was a boxer) becomes bigger and bigger and his songs become hits and makes the record company, Atlantic, a lot of money.  Ray finds a home with his wife Della Bea (Kerry Washington) and they have a child, but Ray has demons of his own.  He keeps flashing back to his childhood where he watched his younger brother drown.  ""Ray"" does not sugarcoat the life of Ray Charles.  It chronicles how Ray got deeper and deeper into drug dependency and addiction and how he was constantly cheating on his wife when he was on the road.  ""Ray"" also gives the beautiful songs of Ray Charles a chance to shine.  I never knew that Ray had recorded ""The Mess Around"" and hearing ""Georgia on my Mind"" is sublime.  ""Ray"" follows Ray Charles through his addiction and through his rehab and we get to see him clean himself up.To be perfectly honest, ""Ray"" runs a little long at 2 hours and 45 minutes.  I don't know what could have been cut or what scene trimmed down, but it started to feel long sometime after 2 hours but before the end.  Despite this, however, Jamie Foxx completely disappears in his role as Ray Charles.  From the first scene to the last, with the exception of one dream sequence, we are not watching Jamie Foxx doing an impersonation.  We are watching Ray Charles.  He is that good.  Everybody else in the film also does an excellent job, but Foxx is the standout and rightfully so.  He carries ""Ray"" on his shoulders and he carries it well.  What best serves this movie is the combination of Jamie Foxx's performance as well as the knowledge that the real Ray Charles had died before this film could be released in the theatres.  It is that knowing the man has only recently died that adds to the appeal and the power of ""Ray"".  Perhaps that is sad or unfair, but it is also reality.  This is not to say that ""Ray"" is not an extremely powerful movie and very well acted and well made.  It is.  But when a film is made about real life, real life affects how the film is perceived.-Joe Sherry",4,Jamie Foxx is exceptional,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",2004,3181,"['film', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'Ray', 'biopic', 'defining', 'period', 'life', 'musician', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'are', 'flashbacks', 'Ray', 'childhood', 'Ray', 'mostly', 'time', 'when', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'first', 'starting', 'out', 'late', '1940', '1960', 'when', 'became', 'huge', 'success', 'Georgia', 'Mind', 'was', 'first', 'black', 'artist', 'refuse', 'play', 'venue', 'was', 'segregated', 'ringing', 'admonishment', 'never', 'let', 'world', 'treat', 'cripple', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'getting', 'bus', 'bound', 'Seattle', 'Florida', 'meeting', 'up', 'very', 'young', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'Larenz', 'Tate', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'would', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'audition', 'club', 'immediately', 'hit', 'club', 'owner', 'manager', 'time', 'cheat', 'money', 'start', 'Time', 'Ray', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'where', 'can', 'play', 'be', 'more', 'control', 'future', 'Ray', 'series', 'successes', 'where', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Charles', 'middle', 'name', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'changed', 'stage', 'name', 'was', 'already', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'who', 'was', 'boxer', 'bigger', 'bigger', 'songs', 'become', 'hits', 'record', 'company', 'Atlantic', 'lot', 'money', 'Ray', 'home', 'wife', 'Della', 'Bea', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'have', 'child', 'Ray', 'demons', 'own', 'flashing', 'back', 'childhood', 'where', 'watched', 'younger', 'brother', 'drown', 'Ray', 'not', 'sugarcoat', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'how', 'Ray', 'got', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'drug', 'dependency', 'addiction', 'how', 'was', 'constantly', 'cheating', 'wife', 'when', 'was', 'road', 'Ray', 'also', 'beautiful', 'songs', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'chance', 'shine', 'never', 'knew', 'Ray', 'had', 'recorded', 'Mess', 'hearing', 'Georgia', 'Mind', 'sublime', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'addiction', 'rehab', 'get', 'see', 'clean', 'up.To', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'Ray', 'little', 'long', '2', 'hours', '45', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'what', 'scene', 'trimmed', 'down', 'started', 'feel', 'long', 'sometime', '2', 'hours', 'end', 'however', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'completely', 'role', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'exception', 'one', 'dream', 'sequence', 'are', 'not', 'watching', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'doing', 'impersonation', 'are', 'watching', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'good', 'Everybody', 'else', 'film', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'Foxx', 'standout', 'rightfully', 'so', 'Ray', 'shoulders', 'well', 'What', 'best', 'movie', 'combination', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'knowledge', 'real', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'had', 'died', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'theatres', 'knowing', 'man', 'only', 'recently', 'died', 'appeal', 'power', 'Ray', 'Perhaps', 'sad', 'unfair', 'also', 'reality', 'not', 'say', 'Ray', 'not', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'made', 'when', 'film', 'made', 'real', 'life', 'real', 'life', 'how', 'film', 'perceived.-Joe', 'Sherry']",Ray

This movie is still in my mind, every bit of it. Jamie Foxx is amazing in channeling Ray. The wonderful period feel of all the scenes drew me into this life and made it completely believable. I lost all sense that Jamie Foxx was playing Ray Charles, and the music, supporting cast, and excellent direction drew me all the way in. Ray's addictions just made him more human, and the movie gives a complete picture of Ray the boy, and Ray the man, although I was left wondering how he developed his musicianship, where he got his first piano, how and where he picked up Nat King Cole's music, etc. But this gap in his development is more than made up for in all the rich details that play out for over two hours, which fly by.

629395,A1J1QS7I60O018,B00005JND5,Jonathan Sabin,"[2, 3]","What a singularly fabulous film.Sitting through this movie, you forget that someone is playing the role of Ray Charles. In an Oscar-worthy performance (and there were a number of others in this biopic), Jamie Foxx BECAME Ray Charles, much the same way Charlize Theron nailed her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wournous in ""Monster.""The major difference of course, being that, despite his faults, Charles was a brilliant and talented individual who is sorely missed. ""Monster"" might have been a great movie, but it was disturbing to watch. ""Ray"" on the other hand, is a great movie that, despite being nearly 2 1/2 hours in length, simply breezes past... and you're almost sorry to see the credits roll at the end.Other stellar performances include Sharon Warren, who plays Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson. She steals almost every scene she's in... and a quick check on IMDB.com reveals that this is her ONLY film (so far!). I'm guessing we'll see her again.Kerry Washington does a superb job portraying Ray's wife, Della Bea Robinson. It's another award-worthy performance.You'll laugh. You'll cry. You won't be able to sit still in your seat. Get out there and enjoy what will likely go down as one of, (if not THE) best films of 2004.Oh. And take a careful look at Ahmet Ertegun, the Atlantic Records executive. If you think you've seen him before but you can't place the face... think ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or ""Risky Business.""

RAY has one at least, perhaps several.Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles Robinson, the truly great American musician and composer, and RAY depicts his professional career and personal trials from 1948, when he left Florida at age 18 on a bus for Seattle, to the late 60s when he kicked a heroin habit. The film is interspersed with numerous flashbacks to his boyhood in Georgia, where, at age 5, he was psychologically scarred by the tragic drowning of his younger brother in a washtub, and where, by age 7, glaucoma rendered him completely blind.I would've been even more impressed with Foxx's role had he been the one singing the Ray Charles songs sprinkled throughout the film, much as Sissy Spacek sang Loretta Lynn's hits in the memorable COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER (1980). However, Jamie's lip-synch was seamless, and he certainly had Ray's mannerisms down. The viewer can be excused for forgetting that it wasn't actually Charles up there on the Big Screen, and Foxx deserves a Best Actor Oscar nomination if there's any justice to the awards process.There are at least two performances worthy of an Academy nod for Best Supporting Actress: Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Ray's on-the-road mistress that inspired the passion which fueled many of his musical compositions, and Sharron Warren as Aretha Robinson, Ray's mother. I wish we could have seen more of the latter. Aretha had fire.In any story of someone transcending poverty to attain fame, usually an entertainer or athlete, there's usually the two-hanky bit where the star returns home to buy Mom a new house or some such. There's no indication in the film that Ray visited Aretha after he left Florida. This may be a puzzle unless the viewer is aware that Aretha died when Ray was 15, something RAY fails to note. Also, the film's conclusion infers that Charles lived happily ever after with his long-suffering wife, Della Bea (Kerry Washington). In fact, Ray and Della divorced in 1977. And my only other niggling objection was the genesis of the song ""Hit the Road, Jack"". As portrayed, it brought forth laughter from the audience; I think it was intended by the scriptwriters and director to be a powerfully dramatic sequence.RAY is arguably 2004's Best Picture. It's certainly a must-see for any consumer of contemporary cinema, and an absolutely obligatory-see for any fan of Ray Charles.",5,Oscarfest,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",2004,2487,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'much', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'fan', 'nekulturny', 'guess', 'do', 'know', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'when', 'see', 'one', 'RAY', 'one', 'least', 'perhaps', 'several.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'truly', 'great', 'American', 'musician', 'composer', 'RAY', 'professional', 'career', 'personal', 'trials', '1948', 'when', 'left', 'Florida', 'age', '18', 'bus', 'Seattle', 'late', '60s', 'when', 'kicked', 'heroin', 'habit', 'film', 'interspersed', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'boyhood', 'Georgia', 'where', 'age', '5', 'was', 'psychologically', 'scarred', 'tragic', 'drowning', 'younger', 'brother', 'washtub', 'where', 'age', '7', 'glaucoma', 'rendered', 'completely', 'blind.I', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'even', 'more', 'impressed', 'Foxx', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'one', 'singing', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'songs', 'sprinkled', 'film', 'much', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'sang', 'Loretta', 'Lynn', 'hits', 'memorable', 'COAL', 'MINER', 'DAUGHTER', '1980', 'However', 'Jamie', 'lip-synch', 'was', 'seamless', 'certainly', 'had', 'Ray', 'mannerisms', 'down', 'viewer', 'can', 'be', 'excused', 'forgetting', 'was', ""n't"", 'actually', 'Charles', 'up', 'there', 'Big', 'Screen', 'Foxx', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'justice', 'awards', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'performances', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'nod', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Regina', 'King', 'Margie', 'Hendricks', 'Ray', 'on-the-road', 'mistress', 'inspired', 'passion', 'fueled', 'many', 'musical', 'compositions', 'Sharron', 'Warren', 'Aretha', 'Robinson', 'Ray', 'mother', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'latter', 'Aretha', 'had', 'fire.In', 'story', 'someone', 'transcending', 'poverty', 'attain', 'fame', 'usually', 'entertainer', 'athlete', 'usually', 'two-hanky', 'bit', 'where', 'star', 'home', 'buy', 'Mom', 'new', 'house', 'such', 'indication', 'film', 'Ray', 'visited', 'Aretha', 'left', 'Florida', 'may', 'be', 'puzzle', 'viewer', 'aware', 'Aretha', 'died', 'when', 'Ray', 'was', '15', 'something', 'RAY', 'note', 'Also', 'film', 'conclusion', 'infers', 'Charles', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Della', 'Bea', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'fact', 'Ray', 'Della', 'divorced', '1977', 'only', 'other', 'niggling', 'objection', 'was', 'genesis', 'song', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'portrayed', 'brought', 'forth', 'laughter', 'audience', 'think', 'was', 'intended', 'scriptwriters', 'director', 'be', 'powerfully', 'dramatic', 'sequence.RAY', 'arguably', '2004', 'Best', 'Picture', 'certainly', 'must-see', 'consumer', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'absolutely', 'obligatory-see', 'fan', 'Ray', 'Charles']",Ray

Please view this as an individual opinion on Universal, not on the content of the Film, Ray.Does anybody else feel how unjust the price of the Limited Edition set is? I mean, how can Universal do this, this is legal crime, and it never ceases to amaze me.Take this into consideration: The Schindler's List Limited Gift Set (Also A Universal Title) has the dvd, soundtrack, photo book, book style DVD case, film cell framed in printed cardboard, certificate of authenticity (even though they are meaningless), and a hard plastic sleeve that sits in a giant plexiglass box with metal support rods. Retail price = $34.98.Ray Limted Edition has the DVD, pretty standard extras given comparison to DVD's like LOTR, Gone With The Wind, Panic Room, and many others, a book style DVD case with photo album attached within it. Retail Price = $44.98. At Best Buy, I paid $36.99 for my Ray Limited Edition, here on Amazon it was cheaper I remember but at the time I am writing this it is not in stock, Schindler's List Gift Set sells at Best Buy for $32.98, and only $24.49 here on Amazon. Return of the King Extended Edition, I paid $22.99 during the first week of release when it was on sale, on Amazon it's still an affordable $23.99. WHERE IS THE JUSTIFICATION IN THE PRICING??Film Distributors are out of line, and will stay that way. You know why? Because we the consumer don't have a choice. Only Universal can sell Ray. So if I want a decent set of extras I have to pay, and I will fork over the cash, because it is the only way to get it. I wish there was a way for consumers to fight back without having to sacrifice our love for our favorite films, films that we want to own.Also may I add that the video quality of this DVD is atrocious, very dull and grainy.

Rarely have I seen a film where nearly every actor gave a memorable performance. There are no wasted scenes in this film! What I found particularly interesting is that it shows what people can overcome when they make up their minds to do so. My favorite lines: You're blind not stupid! You're not a cripple! So many Americans could learn from this inspirational film. I loved it!Jamie Foxx, who also gave an astonishing performance in Collateral opposite Tom Cruise earlier this year, was nothing short of brilliant in this career making film. Foxx has come a long way since his years on the comedy show, In Living Color. Of this, there is no doubt. While I knew it was Jamie Foxx on the screen, I saw Ray Charles. I don't know if Foxx will get another opportunity to shine the way he did in Ray. I think it's safe to say, GIVE THE OSCAR TO MR. FOXX RIGHT NOW. No need to wait!I was first acquainted with Taylor Hackford in the summer of 1980 in a small California town called Victorville. I was there TDY (temporary duty) at George Air Force Base for 45 days. The hotel I was staying at was showing a film called, The Idol Maker, starring Ray Sharkey, known for his television role in the series Wise Guy opposite Ken Wahl. That film was directed by none other than Taylor Hackford who just two years later went on to direct one of my favorite military films, An Officer and a Gentlemen. Hackford also directed Against All Odds, Delores Claiborne, The Devil's Advocate, White Nights, and Proof of Life. Ray easily blows away all of these career building films. This is his best film to date! GIVE HIM THE BEST DIRECTOR OSCAR!Ray Charles never sounded better in this biopic. The soundtrack is worth the price of admission. Georgia on my mind, What'd I Say, Hit The Road Jack, I Can't Stop Loving You, and many more are featured in this film.Other notable performances were given by Kerry Washington, who played Della Bea Robinson and new comer, Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson, mother of the late great Ray Charles. Hopefully, these two women will be nominated for best supporting Oscars along with Foxx and Hackford.The problem, however is that Hollywood is known for not rewarding people when they've earned it. They tend to give Oscars when they want you to have it, which, I find extremely irritating. Having said that, I'll take mine whenever they give it to me!

629402,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00005JND5,Kenji Fujishima,"[1, 4]","The most heartfelt compliment I can give to Taylor Hackford's RAY is that it inspired me to seek out more of Ray Charles' music, and thus discover what a truly great and inspiring musician he was. You can only have the greatest respect for a man who dealt with his blindness and a childhood tragedy (the drowning death of his kid brother) by making great music and revolutionizing the sound of R&B; in the process (his mixing of R&B; with gospel sounds was scandalous at the time). And what versatility!---from early original hits like ""I've Got a Woman"" and ""What I'd Say,"" he eventually put his brilliant interpretive stamp on country music, which is where his classic rendition of ""Georgia on my Mind"" comes from. But, above all, Ray Charles' soulful voice was his calling card; very few musicians feel the words he sings quite the way Brother Ray did.All of this comes through brilliantly in RAY, as does Charles' manipulative dark side: he ruthlessly switched labels when one couldn't match another's offer, and he had a tendency to coldly cast off friends as quickly as he made them. ""Music is a business, baby,"" Ray (Jamie Foxx) says in the movie, and he certainly treated it that way. And of course there was his drug addiction, which he eventually kicked cold turkey.The achievement of RAY is that both Hackford and its star, Jamie Foxx, do not shy away from Ray Charles' less savory characteristics, but nevertheless do a good job of depicting the man and the impact he had on music. The only major flaw of the film is that at times it lapses into biopic cliches---especially the ending, which throws in a silly dream sequence that suggests that, only after he was able to move on from the terrible memory of his brother's drowning death was he able to cast off his demons, an explanation that, as most biopic explanations tend to be, seems much too pat. But what RAY gets right---how well it explains what a major impact his music had---is what makes this a cherishable movie.Among its other achievements, RAY has also made me a believer of Jamie Foxx. Anyone who can pull off such a stunning portrayal of such a musical giant, and do it without a hint of vanity, deserves all the respect he gets. Foxx's performance is not so much an imitation as it is an inhabitation: he gets Ray's famous physical mannerisms right, but he also paints Ray as a flawed but spirited individual who, despite his attitude toward women and the business side of music, loved to perform and loved to live. As you watch the film, you barely feel Foxx there; he is so immersed in Ray Charles that he almost becomes the man (at least, until that silly concluding dream sequence, in which he has to take off his sunglasses and open his eyes). 2004 really was Foxx's year: he not only did justice to Ray Charles; he also nearly acted poor hard-working Tom Cruise off the screen in Michael Mann's COLLATERAL. He now has an Oscar to show for it, and one that is well-deserved.RAY is not a great movie, but its good points far outweigh its lapses into conventional moralizing. Such a seminal musician as Ray Charles deserves a movie that touches at the heart of why he was so special, and RAY, more often than not, does that admirably.

629404,A1OBJ2263JCK5,B00005JND5,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[0, 1]","Doing a music film biography can be a pretty tricky thing to pull off. They can either turn out to be triumphs such as ""Whats Love Got to With It"" (the amazing survival story of singer, Tina Turner) or total artistic stink-bombs like Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"" (60's rocker, Jim Morrison). Thankfully, Taylor Hackford's Academy Award winning film, ""Ray"", the story of legendary soul singer/musician, Ray Charles, belongs in the former catagory. In fact it's probably one of the best music biographies ever made. The film follows Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) from his childhood in abject poverty to his rise in musical fame & fortune. In his childhood he sees his younger brother accidentally drown (which haunts him) and shortly after he goes blind from glaucoma. Charles' strong willed mother, Della (Kerry Washington) teaches him with ""tough love"" (""I aint gonna be around forever, so you better learn to do it yourself"") to stand on his own two feet and survive in this world. Charles takes the lessons to heart. He has an affinity for music. We follow him on a personally messy but artistically successful, life long trip, that takes him from the juke joints of the segregated, deep rural South to the most famous concert stages of the world. I think one of the reasons this film is so successful is because it presents us with the portrait of a truely conflicted man, who almost has a dual personality. On one hand it shows Ray Charles the ""musical genuis"" of both the stage and the studio. Here was a man who wore the word ""genuis"" like a crown.This was not just hype. The film shows, that he was a musical innovator (meshing gospel & blues together to create his own unique R&B style) consumate professional, a perfectionist and a tough taskmaster, who had high expectations for the musicians, that worked for him. On the other hand, the movie also presents a man with an equally messy personal life, that included heroin addiction, marital problems and numerous sexual affairs. It presents a conflicted man, who had lived a very tough life, with many personal demons, but who eventually perservered. Director Taylor Hackford does a fantastic job of telling this story in a wonderfully dynamic fashion, that keeps the viewer wanting more. But the real key for the artistic success of this film has got to be the mesmorizing, title role performance from Actor, Jamie Foxx. Foxx dosn't just merely mimic or do a slick impersonation (although he does a great job in that respect). Instead its almost as if he becomes Ray Charles himself and reveals in his performance, what the essence of the man was. This truely was the best acting performance of 2004 and Foxx roundly deserved his 'Best Actor' Oscar. Other very good performances from the film included Kerry Washington as Charles' no-nonsense mother, Sharon Warren as his first wife Aretha and Curtis Armstrong as Atlantic Records owner/producer, Ahmet Ertegun. Finally, mention should be made of the wonderfully faithful recreations of Ray Charles' legendary live shows. You really feel like your at one of his concerts. The filmmaker wisely chose to use Ray Charles' original recordings for the soundtrack and Jamie Foxx to lip-synch to. Wise choice, because only Ray Charles could make sounds like that. I wasn't much of a Ray Charles fan before I saw this movie, but I came out of the theatre tapping my toes and humming the tunes. Now, all thanks to this film, I'm trying to collect all the Ray Charles music, I can get my hands on! Great movie! Great music!

629406,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00005JND5,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[0, 1]","An individual is the result of all experiences - good and bad.  The experiences comprise of the knowledge learned through others, which brings about a change within the person.  This change affects the person's morals, beliefs, and values, and as the person ventures through life there will be numerous characters with some input to the person.  However, usually there are a few strong characters that stick out in a person's mind when it comes to those who enlightened them on their path through life.  Ray Charles Robinson had several, but one sticks out more than others - his mother.Ray Charles had several interesting experiences and the audience is to visually experience a number of them through the wonderful performance of Jamie Foxx.  The story begins with how Ray travels across America by Greyhound while facing prejudice not only to his skin color, but also in regards to his blindness.  Through Ray's experiences the film uses flashbacks to where he learned how to handle several of the situations, as his mother urged him to not accept the pity of others.  Instead his mother taught him how to stand on his own two feet, and how to be righteous person with good morals.The moments when Ray recollects his past and his mother's advice are initially happy with memories of his brother and his mom despite their poverty.  However, these memories slowly turn into a darkness and internal turmoil, as Ray begins to hallucinate about water and wet floors.  This unhappy memory seems to torment Ray in ways that handicaps him from function like a normal human being.  Through his first job as a pianist for a small group he is introduced to pot, which helps him self-medicate his personal issues.  Pot ends up being the key to Pandora's box, as he eventually moves to heavier drugs to deal with his painful memory that seem to burden him beyond reason.Eventually Ray meets Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) from Atlantic Records, and he is intrigued by Ray's musical skills, and offers him to stop thinking about pennies, and instead focus on making dollars.  Through Ray's partnership with Atlantic Records he is encouraged to develop his own sound, but it is difficult for him, as he has always played what others desired.  After a radio interview in Huston, Texas, Ray meets with Della Bea (Kerry Washington) who he ends up marrying, but she also encourages him to be himself in regards to everything.  This leads to Ray toward making his own first hit, ""I Got a Woman"", which brings out Ray's new and personal sound through a fusion of gospel and rhythm & blues.  The music is an essential portion of the film; as it brings light and color into hearing Ray's way of perceiving the world.Through hit songs with new sounds such as ""Georgia on My Mind"", ""Hit the Road Jack"", and ""Unchain My Heart"" among many others Ray Charles' popularity grew.  However, the songs became a tool for him to exorcise his own demons that haunted him through the many experiences that he had acquired while being on the road.  Being on the road meant illicit drugs, numerous women, and overwhelming guilt, as he felt ashamed cheating on his wife.  Together the guilt and his self-medicated heroin addiction grew stronger while he developed drug jitters and other drug related behaviors.  The combined affect of his personal life, drug addiction, and the past memories kept haunting him as he could recall the death of his younger brother for which he still felt tremendous guilt.  The world began to close in on him, as the law enforcement was arresting him for drug possession, and his wife was about to leave him while noticing that his musical career were slipping out of his hands.  With the many experiences that Ray had he still reflected over what his mother once taught him, and trusted her life lessons to guide him on the right path.Ray is a poignant film by Taylor Hackford who made films such as The Devil's Advocate (1997) and An Officer and a Gentleman (1982).  Hackford brings a very authentic feel to the many places that Ray Charles played though the use of good mise-en-scene, an excellent cast, and vivid cinematography.  In addition, the jumps between hallucinations, flashbacks, and reality offer the audience a genuine sense of how Ray must have felt, but this is also enhanced by Jamie Foxx's outstanding performance.  The flashbacks, too, are colorful, which accentuates the importance of his childhood, and especially his mother, but it also flashes some light on how important those moments before blindness might have been.  The flashbacks are also drenched in emotional substance, which the audience gets to experience through Ray in his dark world.  Ultimately, Ray offers the audience a brilliant cinematic experience that should be reflected upon with closed eyes while pondering on our own experiences and those who have affected our life choices.",5,Ray Charles - A Musical Genius with Deep Scars...,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,4868,"['individual', 'result', 'experiences', 'good', 'bad', 'experiences', 'comprise', 'knowledge', 'learned', 'others', 'change', 'person', 'change', 'person', 'morals', 'beliefs', 'values', 'person', 'ventures', 'life', 'will', 'be', 'numerous', 'characters', 'input', 'person', 'However', 'usually', 'are', 'few', 'strong', 'characters', 'stick', 'out', 'person', 'mind', 'when', 'who', 'enlightened', 'path', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'had', 'several', 'one', 'out', 'more', 'others', 'mother.Ray', 'Charles', 'had', 'several', 'interesting', 'experiences', 'audience', 'visually', 'experience', 'number', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'story', 'how', 'Ray', 'America', 'Greyhound', 'facing', 'prejudice', 'not', 'only', 'skin', 'color', 'also', 'regards', 'blindness', 'Ray', 'experiences', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'where', 'learned', 'how', 'handle', 'several', 'situations', 'mother', 'urged', 'not', 'accept', 'pity', 'others', 'Instead', 'mother', 'taught', 'how', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'how', 'be', 'righteous', 'person', 'good', 'morals.The', 'moments', 'when', 'Ray', 'past', 'mother', 'advice', 'are', 'initially', 'happy', 'memories', 'brother', 'mom', 'poverty', 'However', 'memories', 'slowly', 'turn', 'darkness', 'internal', 'turmoil', 'Ray', 'hallucinate', 'water', 'wet', 'floors', 'unhappy', 'memory', 'torment', 'Ray', 'ways', 'handicaps', 'function', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'first', 'job', 'pianist', 'small', 'group', 'introduced', 'pot', 'self-medicate', 'personal', 'issues', 'Pot', 'up', 'being', 'key', 'Pandora', 'box', 'eventually', 'heavier', 'drugs', 'deal', 'painful', 'memory', 'seem', 'burden', 'reason.Eventually', 'Ray', 'meets', 'Ahmet', 'Ertegun', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'intrigued', 'Ray', 'musical', 'skills', 'stop', 'thinking', 'pennies', 'instead', 'focus', 'making', 'dollars', 'Ray', 'partnership', 'Atlantic', 'Records', 'encouraged', 'develop', 'own', 'sound', 'difficult', 'always', 'played', 'what', 'others', 'desired', 'radio', 'interview', 'Huston', 'Texas', 'Ray', 'Della', 'Bea', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'who', 'up', 'marrying', 'also', 'be', 'regards', 'everything', 'Ray', 'making', 'own', 'first', 'hit', 'Got', 'Woman', 'out', 'Ray', 'new', 'personal', 'sound', 'fusion', 'gospel', 'rhythm', 'blues', 'music', 'essential', 'portion', 'film', 'light', 'color', 'hearing', 'Ray', 'way', 'perceiving', 'world.Through', 'hit', 'songs', 'new', 'sounds', 'such', 'Georgia', 'My', 'Mind', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'Unchain', 'My', 'Heart', 'many', 'others', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'popularity', 'grew', 'However', 'songs', 'became', 'tool', 'exorcise', 'own', 'demons', 'haunted', 'many', 'experiences', 'had', 'acquired', 'being', 'road', 'Being', 'road', 'meant', 'illicit', 'drugs', 'numerous', 'women', 'overwhelming', 'guilt', 'felt', 'ashamed', 'cheating', 'wife', 'guilt', 'self-medicated', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'grew', 'stronger', 'developed', 'drug', 'jitters', 'other', 'drug', 'related', 'behaviors', 'combined', 'affect', 'personal', 'life', 'drug', 'addiction', 'past', 'memories', 'kept', 'haunting', 'could', 'recall', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'still', 'felt', 'tremendous', 'guilt', 'world', 'began', 'close', 'law', 'enforcement', 'was', 'arresting', 'drug', 'possession', 'wife', 'was', 'leave', 'noticing', 'musical', 'career', 'were', 'slipping', 'hands', 'many', 'experiences', 'Ray', 'had', 'still', 'reflected', 'what', 'mother', 'once', 'taught', 'trusted', 'life', 'lessons', 'guide', 'right', 'path.Ray', 'poignant', 'film', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'who', 'made', 'films', 'such', 'Devil', 'Advocate', '1997', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', '1982', 'Hackford', 'very', 'authentic', 'feel', 'many', 'places', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'played', 'use', 'good', 'mise-en-scene', 'excellent', 'cast', 'vivid', 'cinematography', 'addition', 'jumps', 'hallucinations', 'flashbacks', 'reality', 'offer', 'audience', 'genuine', 'sense', 'how', 'Ray', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'also', 'enhanced', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'flashbacks', 'too', 'are', 'colorful', 'importance', 'childhood', 'especially', 'mother', 'also', 'light', 'how', 'important', 'moments', 'blindness', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'also', 'drenched', 'emotional', 'substance', 'audience', 'experience', 'Ray', 'dark', 'world', 'Ultimately', 'Ray', 'audience', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'should', 'be', 'reflected', 'closed', 'eyes', 'pondering', 'own', 'experiences', 'who', 'have', 'affected', 'life', 'choices']",Ray

629410,A2RY3JWNMSREMD,B00005JND5,Kristina,"[2, 3]","Everyone knows the music of Ray Charles but very few people know his real life story. This is a wonderful if sad movie about the musician's life. Ican now understand why Jamie Foxx won best actor. The role he had toperform was both physically and emotionally challenging. What I found even more amazing is that I didn't once think 'this is Jamie Foxx and I wonder  what he is thinking,' during the whole movie.Jamie as Ray was excellent. I also liked how at the end they showed clips of the real Ray Charles and some photographs. One of the things I couldn't help but think about during the movie was how strong Ray's mother was.She lost one son to a horrible, fatalaccident and then her other child went blind. I couldn't even begin to imagine what that was like. She had o act cruel so that Ray could learn how to defend himself, and she said to Ray 'Don't ever let anyone make you become a cripple.' (Or words to that effect.)All of the other actors gave very strong performances as well. I especially loved Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun. For some reason I just thought that he was great to watch, although everyone was good. I didn't know a lotabout Ray but not only did I learn about Ray but I also learned about the time that he lived in. I thought it was so sad at the beginning of the movie, when Ray and the other African Americans had to sit at the back of the bus and how they had a sign with the word 'colored' on it.I didn't realize how much Ray was so deeply into dope. It was really hard to watch the rehabilitation scenes. This is one of those parts in the movies where I felt the film should had been rated R. These scenes where very graphic and intense.I hadn't known that Ray was friends with Quincy Jones or the fact that he had a mistress. I thought that was very sad. But I found it even more sad that his mistress O.D.'d and left behind their illegitimate son.But I'm getting ahead of myself. This is a really good movie. It was not only entertaining but it made me really think about the time that Ray was living in as well.",4,"He Lived On the Edge Of Music, Fear, and Love",1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,2052,"['Everyone', 'music', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'know', 'real', 'life', 'story', 'wonderful', 'sad', 'movie', 'musician', 'life', 'Ican', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'won', 'best', 'actor', 'role', 'had', 'toperform', 'was', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'challenging', 'What', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'did', ""n't"", 'once', 'think', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'wonder', 'what', 'thinking', 'whole', 'movie.Jamie', 'Ray', 'was', 'excellent', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'end', 'showed', 'clips', 'real', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'photographs', 'One', 'things', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'strong', 'Ray', 'mother', 'was.She', 'lost', 'one', 'son', 'horrible', 'fatalaccident', 'then', 'other', 'child', 'went', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'imagine', 'what', 'was', 'had', 'o', 'act', 'cruel', 'Ray', 'could', 'learn', 'how', 'defend', 'said', 'Ray', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'ever', 'let', 'anyone', 'make', 'become', 'cripple', 'words', 'effect', 'other', 'actors', 'gave', 'very', 'strong', 'performances', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'loved', 'Curtis', 'Armstrong', 'Ahmet', 'Ertegun', 'reason', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'watch', 'everyone', 'was', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'lotabout', 'Ray', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'learn', 'Ray', 'also', 'learned', 'time', 'lived', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'sad', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'Ray', 'other', 'African', 'Americans', 'had', 'sit', 'back', 'bus', 'how', 'had', 'sign', 'word', ""'colored"", 'it.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'Ray', 'was', 'so', 'deeply', 'dope', 'was', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'rehabilitation', 'scenes', 'one', 'parts', 'movies', 'where', 'felt', 'film', 'should', 'had', 'been', 'rated', 'R.', 'scenes', 'where', 'very', 'graphic', 'intense.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'known', 'Ray', 'was', 'friends', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'fact', 'had', 'mistress', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'found', 'even', 'more', 'sad', 'mistress', 'O.D', ""'d"", 'left', 'behind', 'illegitimate', 'son.But', ""'m"", 'getting', 'ahead', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'entertaining', 'made', 'really', 'think', 'time', 'Ray', 'was', 'living', 'as', 'well']",Ray

Bernabo,"[1, 1]","After watching the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards I was thinking that Jamie Foxx is going to win the Best Actor Oscar for ""Ray"" because everybody is going to want to hear him do another acceptance speech (he has to be saving the best for last).  Of course, after watching ""Ray"" it becomes obvious the members of the Academy have an even better reason for honoring the performance, even if Foxx is not having a year in which his career has reached the high water mark with another Oscar nomination for his ""Supporting Role"" in ""Collateral and his SAG nomination for his performance in ""Redemption: The Stan Tookie Williams Story"" on television.  True, Foxx does not do his own singing in ""Ray,"" but he does play the piano and why would you want to hear anybody other than Ray Charles sing?  In 20th century American popular music in terms of signers there is Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley and Ray Charles.  I keep trying to come up with one more for the thumb, but Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan are more songwriters than singers and everybody else you can name as singers are just not in that league.The film by director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter James L. White basically tells the story of how Ray Charles came to two pivotal moments in his life.  The first is when he took the emerging sound of Rhythm & Blues and added gospel powered vocals to basically create soul music when ""I Got a Woman"" was released in 1955.  Everything he sings before that point is pretty good, such as ""Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand,"" but it is not great and it all sounds more like Nat ""King"" Cole or Charles Brown that the authentic Ray Charles.  So the first part of the movie has to do with Ray Charles finding his voice.  The rest of ""Ray"" is the load road to the second pivotal point, where Charles kicks his heroin habit.Except for a choice moment of person redemption from the Georgia State Legislature, the story of Ray Charles is over at that point.  We can then turn from the DVD to CDs of Ray Charles singing all of the songs we heard him sing in the movie from ""Night Time is the Right Time"" (a.k.a. the number from ""The Cosby Show"" for the younger generations) and ""What I'd Say"" to ""Georgia"" and ""Hit the Road Jack.""  But the great irony is that after Charles kicked his drug habit he was never as great.  He was still very, very good, making any song he sang his own, as when he covered ""Yesterday,"" ""Eleanor Rigby,"" ""Look What They've Done to My Song, Ma,"" ""Living for the City"" and ""America.""  But the creative fire was gone.  That is why this film ends where it does.  You would not say that the career of Ray Charles was ever in descent, but clearly the glory days of ascension had ended.""Ray"" is a reminder of the greatness of Ray Charles as a singer.  It is sad that the singer died shortly after the film was shot because he should be deservedly basking in the glory along with Foxx.  But then there is no doubt that Ray Charles knew he was an American institution.  Still, I wonder if he had to do it over again if Ray Charles would have avoided doing drugs.  In the context of this 2004 biopic Ray's motivation for doing drugs is his feelings of guilt over the accidental death of his younger brother when they were children (and before Charles went blind).  His ability to kick heroin is tied to his coming to terms with that personal tragedy, so the argument is that it was not the drugs that fueled the way he played the piano and sang, but rather guilt.  If you took away that guilt would that destroy his passion?  If you took away the drugs would that passion have simply destroyed him?  Today we live in a world with Ray Charles, but this film suggests the possibility of a world where we never would have known he was alive and convinces us that would have been even worse.",5,"Jamie Foxx channels the late, great Ray Charles",1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,3816,"['watching', 'Golden', 'Globes', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'Awards', 'was', 'thinking', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'going', 'win', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'Ray', 'everybody', 'going', 'want', 'hear', 'do', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'be', 'saving', 'best', 'last', 'course', 'watching', 'Ray', 'obvious', 'members', 'Academy', 'have', 'even', 'better', 'reason', 'honoring', 'performance', 'even', 'Foxx', 'not', 'having', 'year', 'career', 'reached', 'high', 'water', 'mark', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Supporting', 'Role', 'Collateral', 'SAG', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Redemption', 'Stan', 'Tookie', 'Williams', 'Story', 'television', 'True', 'Foxx', 'not', 'do', 'own', 'singing', 'Ray', 'play', 'piano', 'why', 'would', 'want', 'hear', 'anybody', 'other', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'sing', '20th', 'century', 'American', 'popular', 'music', 'terms', 'signers', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'keep', 'trying', 'come', 'up', 'one', 'more', 'thumb', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'are', 'more', 'songwriters', 'singers', 'everybody', 'else', 'can', 'name', 'singers', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'league.The', 'film', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'screenwriter', 'James', 'L.', 'White', 'basically', 'story', 'how', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'came', 'two', 'pivotal', 'moments', 'life', 'first', 'when', 'took', 'emerging', 'sound', 'Rhythm', 'Blues', 'added', 'gospel', 'powered', 'vocals', 'basically', 'create', 'soul', 'music', 'when', 'Got', 'Woman', 'was', 'released', '1955', 'Everything', 'point', 'pretty', 'good', 'such', 'Baby', 'Let', 'Me', 'Hold', 'Your', 'Hand', 'not', 'great', 'more', 'Nat', 'King', 'Cole', 'Charles', 'Brown', 'authentic', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'do', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'finding', 'voice', 'rest', 'Ray', 'load', 'road', 'second', 'pivotal', 'point', 'where', 'Charles', 'heroin', 'habit.Except', 'choice', 'moment', 'person', 'redemption', 'Georgia', 'State', 'Legislature', 'story', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'over', 'point', 'can', 'then', 'turn', 'DVD', 'CDs', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'singing', 'songs', 'heard', 'sing', 'movie', 'Night', 'Time', 'Right', 'Time', 'a.k.a', 'number', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'younger', 'generations', 'What', ""'d"", 'Say', 'Georgia', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'great', 'irony', 'Charles', 'kicked', 'drug', 'habit', 'was', 'never', 'great', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'song', 'sang', 'own', 'when', 'covered', 'Yesterday', 'Eleanor', 'Rigby', 'Look', 'What', ""'ve"", 'Done', 'My', 'Song', 'Ma', 'Living', 'City', 'America', 'creative', 'fire', 'was', 'gone', 'why', 'film', 'where', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'career', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'ever', 'descent', 'clearly', 'glory', 'days', 'ascension', 'had', 'ended', 'Ray', 'reminder', 'greatness', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'singer', 'sad', 'singer', 'died', 'shortly', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'should', 'be', 'deservedly', 'basking', 'glory', 'Foxx', 'then', 'doubt', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'knew', 'was', 'American', 'institution', 'Still', 'wonder', 'had', 'do', 'over', 'again', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'would', 'have', 'avoided', 'doing', 'drugs', 'context', '2004', 'biopic', 'Ray', 'motivation', 'doing', 'drugs', 'feelings', 'guilt', 'accidental', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'Charles', 'went', 'ability', 'kick', 'heroin', 'tied', 'coming', 'terms', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'argument', 'was', 'not', 'drugs', 'fueled', 'way', 'played', 'piano', 'sang', 'rather', 'guilt', 'took', 'away', 'guilt', 'would', 'destroy', 'passion', 'took', 'away', 'drugs', 'would', 'passion', 'have', 'simply', 'destroyed', 'Today', 'live', 'world', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'film', 'possibility', 'world', 'where', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'known', 'was', 'alive', 'convinces', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'worse']",Ray

I understand he was involved in the project until shortly before his death.  No wonder Jamie Foxx did such a good job of depicting him.  He really did study the man and seemed to morph into him for the film.  It's not surprising he won an academy award for his performance.From the very beginning I was drawn into Ray's story which I had expected to be maudlin.  It wasn't.  Yes, he became blind as a child.  And yes, he had a traumatic childhood experience before that in which his little brother drowned in a washtub.  Through his child's eyes, he didn't realize the seriousness of the accident and didn't make any move to save him.  This incident had to effect him for the rest of his life.Ray's mother, however, wanted her little boy to be strong.  As he was going blind she refused to let him feel pity for himself.  Instead she taught him to cope with his blindness and even sent him off to a school for the blind in order to complete his education in becoming self sufficient.  And he certainly did become self-sufficient, traveling across the country by bus to find work in a club playing piano.  He was great.  And he was also exploited, especially because he was blind.  Eventually, he wised up and his career soared.He married a sweet woman and started a family.  But she never traveled on the road with him.  And he soon became involved with a whole series of other women.  He also became a heroin addict and fought these demons for most of his life.This is just the basic story.  How it was put together was what made this film glow.  The director wisely focused on Ray's courage and conflicts.  And, after a while, his being blind became only a part of this complex human being who we saw evolving on the screen.  What an extraordinary life this man had.  And what an extraordinary performance that Jamie Fox did.  The film was perfect.  I wouldn't change a word of it.  Highly recommended.",5,Ray Charles' courage and conflicts. A perfect film.

I have laid all my eggs in one nest, meaning I have only been listening to one source of music my whole life- rap music. But after seeing this music, I have learnt that you shouldn't lay your eggs in one nest (that goes for everyday life situations too, like relationships etc.). I have now taken the time to settle myself into music like reggae, blues, jazz and funk, and I must say, I have been missing out on incredible things for the last 18 years of my life.It's the story of a man who was blinded at an early age and faced some horrors of life, including racism. For years, he was doubted because of his skin color but it just goes to show, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. Though he was blind, Ray had the gift to make incredible music in his head and play it on the piano. Not only that, but he was given the talent to use such a powerful and incredible voice that soared throughout the whole world. Through his lifetime, Ray experiences many changes- he becomes a father but cheats on his wife with other women (thus, ending up in horrible situations), he becomes addicted to heroin, he smokes every 5 seconds and so on. Also, many record companies had used him for his talent so they could get the money.Ray Charles was a genius and still is, even through his death. This movie has grown a lot on me since I've seen it and I'd see it again and again. That's how powerful and touching this movie is.Like I said, Jamie Foxx performs at his VERY best, hell, you could even say Foxx and Charles look like twins with the glasses on and the smile. I wouldn't be surprised if Foxx won an Academy for this, for he deserves it for so much effort.For all those who have done the same thing as me and have seen this movie, I suggest you should expand your knowledge in music. Ray Charles showed the world that he stood against all odds and won, this fact proves that ""what doesn't kill a real man can only make him stronger"". That's a fact that made Ray what he is today and forever.R.I.P.

I went into the film remembering Ray Charles as a musician my folks liked and came out with a greater respect and appreciation for the artist that he was.  Like all of us, Ray had his demons and the film did not shy away from dealing with his womanizing and drug addiction.  But to think of what this man accomplished as an artist is truly amazing.  Jamie Foxx is brillant as Ray.  If you are surprised by his performance here, don't be.  He has managed to make every film I've seen him in watchable and in this one, he is mesmerizing.  And he is not alone in turning in a fine performance.  Ray is loaded with them, from Sharon Warren's exceptional performance as Ray's mother Aretha, to Kerry Washington's fine performance as Della Bea, Ray's wife.  Last but not least, Regina King's performance burns with an intensity that jumps off the screen as Margie, Ray's favorite ""Ray Lette.""  Ms. King has always been a presence, even in small roles and in this one, she goes for it and lets it all out.  Taylor Hackford is a director who manages to get the best out of his actors and it is the acting and the music of Ray Charles that truly shines in this film.  I saw Ray last night and this film has haunted me all day long, it is so deeply felt. If this isn't a big winner at the Oscars, Hollywood needs to stop giving the award out.

Mintah ""Author of the Heart""","[1, 2]","Most of us under sixty think of Ray Charles as a perpetually smiling, swaying, grayed old man wearing sunglasses, glued to the piano bench who mumbles out ""Georgia.""  What most do not realize is that Ray Charles had been performing since the 1940's until his death in 2004.  This film shows Ray as a vibrant young man and opens our eyes to a whole new world that many have never known, a world that includes segregation and the civil rights movement.  The movie spans from Ray's childhood up until around 1963.  Considering that Ray's career went on for forty years AFTER that is astounding.Ray Charles was born in Albany, Georgia, in 1930.  Growing up in poverty in Florida during the Great Depression, he lost his little brother in a tragic accident that would haunt him the rest of his life.  Around age seven, he went blind from glaucoma.  Ray honed his knack for music at the state school for the blind and deaf.Although a true genius and pioneer of jazz, R&B;, and even country western, Ray (Jamie Foxx) was not a perfect human being by any means.  Ray had learned to be fiercely independent from his fiery and dedicated mother Aretha (Sharon Warren), who died when he was fifteen.  Yet he was dependent on a couple of demons - women and heroin.  These addictions had tragic consequences.  The fact that Bea, his long-suffering wife (Regina King), stood by him all those years is an example of the kind of chemistry and love this man inspired.The movie reminds me so much of The Temptations (1998) as far as how the plot unfolds, that I would have given ""Ray"" four stars if it were not for Foxx's and Warren's performances.  Foxx won Best Male Leading Actor for his sublime performance of a legend and an icon.  Sharon Warren was so intense as Ray's mother.  With her visible biceps on a fragile frame, she embodied the plight of all African Americans during Jim Crow.  I want to see Warren again in a film.  She is absolutely amazing.The movie has sexuality and drug use, but nothing too graphic.  There is no bad language.  All of the songs in the film are Ray's original recordings, lip-synched very well by Foxx and the backup girls.  When I heard that the songs would be lip-synched, I did not think I would enjoy it, but it works very well and was very entertaining.The DVD has commentary by the director, and short readable bios of just about all the main and supporting actors in the film.  It is a little annoying to have to read the white font and keep scrolling endlessly through each bio.",5,The Road Leads Back To You,1115856000,"05 12, 2005",2005,2506,"['Most', 'sixty', 'think', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'perpetually', 'smiling', 'swaying', 'grayed', 'old', 'man', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'glued', 'piano', 'bench', 'who', 'out', 'Georgia', 'What', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'realize', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'had', 'been', 'performing', '1940', 'death', '2004', 'film', 'Ray', 'vibrant', 'young', 'man', 'eyes', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'many', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'world', 'segregation', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'movie', 'Ray', 'childhood', 'up', '1963', 'Considering', 'Ray', 'career', 'went', 'forty', 'years', 'AFTER', 'astounding.Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'born', 'Albany', 'Georgia', '1930', 'Growing', 'up', 'poverty', 'Florida', 'Great', 'Depression', 'lost', 'little', 'brother', 'tragic', 'accident', 'would', 'haunt', 'rest', 'life', 'age', 'seven', 'went', 'glaucoma', 'Ray', 'honed', 'knack', 'music', 'state', 'school', 'blind', 'true', 'genius', 'pioneer', 'jazz', 'R', 'B', 'even', 'country', 'western', 'Ray', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'was', 'not', 'perfect', 'human', 'being', 'means', 'Ray', 'had', 'learned', 'be', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'fiery', 'dedicated', 'mother', 'Aretha', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'fifteen', 'was', 'dependent', 'couple', 'demons', 'women', 'heroin', 'addictions', 'had', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'fact', 'Bea', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Regina', 'King', 'stood', 'years', 'example', 'kind', 'chemistry', 'love', 'man', 'movie', 'reminds', 'so', 'much', 'Temptations', '1998', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'Ray', 'four', 'stars', 'were', 'not', 'Foxx', 'Warren', 'performances', 'Foxx', 'won', 'Best', 'Male', 'Leading', 'Actor', 'sublime', 'performance', 'legend', 'icon', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'Ray', 'mother', 'visible', 'biceps', 'fragile', 'frame', 'embodied', 'plight', 'African', 'Americans', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'want', 'see', 'Warren', 'again', 'film', 'absolutely', 'amazing.The', 'movie', 'sexuality', 'drug', 'use', 'nothing', 'too', 'graphic', 'bad', 'language', 'songs', 'film', 'are', 'Ray', 'original', 'recordings', 'lip-synched', 'very', 'well', 'Foxx', 'backup', 'girls', 'When', 'heard', 'songs', 'would', 'be', 'lip-synched', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'enjoy', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'director', 'short', 'readable', 'bios', 'just', 'main', 'supporting', 'actors', 'film', 'little', 'annoying', 'have', 'read', 'white', 'font', 'keep', 'scrolling', 'endlessly', 'bio']",Ray
629420,A1I9B4PSCDDWOO,B00005JND5,"lordhoot ""lordhoot""","[3, 5]","The rating should be about 3.5 stars. First I would like to say that Jaime Foxx gave a performance of his life in this movie. He managed to captured the physical behavior of Ray Charles without trying to mimic him. That is a hard thing to do for an actor. Foxx's performance is probably the best I have seen this year and definitely lightyears ahead of anyone else. The music and sound of the movie was also a winner. Foxx captured Ray Charles superbly well in all aspects.Having wrote all that, why wasn't this movie rated ""five""? Well, just because the actor is fantastic, doesn't make the film that way. Ultimately, this movie was downer for me. Take away Ray Charles' genius and talent for music and this is what you have: a drug addict, a bad and faithless husband, lousy father and fair-weathered friend. His ambition made him self driven but at the same time, self-centered. In this movie without his music, Ray Charles was one miserable human being. I am sure Ray Charles did more during the Civil Right movement then just refusing to played for a Jim Crow concert in Georgia. The movie didn't focus on any of his positive aspects outside of his music. Didn't he had any positive aspects personally?? I supposed at the end of the movie when he finally kicked the heroin addiction, he became a better man to his family, friends and to himself but we don't get to see how he evolved. Non-musical aspects of the movie dealt with his negatives, even the flashbacks scenes showing Ray Charles as a boy exactly don't help as if it was creating an excuse why Ray is such a lousy guy outside of his music. The movie was repetitive with scenes of Ray cheating on his wife, taking drugs and using up loyal friends. It was rather one dimensional in that aspect.But its still a good film, Jaime Foxx's performance glued you to that theater seat. Even during the ""slow and dragging"" parts of the film of which there were quite a few, Foxx's performance was good enough to keep you from yawning. Can this get him the Oscar nomination?

ABOUT THE HD-I feel that any movie that you want to watch repeatedly is worth owning on HD or Blue-Ray. If...you have a TV that is capable of showing the difference. The one thing I was hoping for was that the vintage footage from the late 40's and early 50's would be sharper. No. And thinking on it it shouldn't be.

He's a great comedian, sure, but as a dramatic actor he's even better (Ali, Collateral, this movie). His impersonation of Ray Charles was so believable that, after a while into the movie, you're not sure if you're seeing the real guy on the screen any more.On top of Foxx's performance, the movie serves as a very good view of a brilliant man (a genius, indeed) who faced the challenges of heroin dependency (much like most succesful jazz, blues and soul musicians in the bulk of the twentieth century). But most important, it presents him as he was able to overcome that. The power of his upbringing by his single mom cannot be overlooked: that woman left an indelible mark on Ray Charles Robinson, which accompanied him and urged him up and forward until his end.It must be said this may not be a movie for all audiences.

I must say that the film does follow the standard formula of the Hollywood biography pic, but it is the performances that raise this move from simply very good to great--even outstanding.  It is as if every actor in the film realized this was the opportunity of a lifetime and brought their A game, and based on the way Hollywood treats Black actors, they were right to do so!  Jamie Foxx is a revelation as Ray Charles.  I cannot even imagine there being another performance this year to match this one.  It truly deserves to go down in history as one of the greatest screen achievements in film.  It is true that you forget that you are even watching Jamie Foxx...he is that awesome.  The Oscar is as good as his!!That said, I also want to spend some time heralding the other actors in this film.  Sharon Warren, in her film debut, is superb as Ray's mother.  Warren captures the spirit of this determined woman with a mix of grit, vulnerability and compassion.  She and the little boy who plays Ray as a youngster, C. J. Samuels, are both heartbreakingly good!  Clifton Powell is fantastic as Ray ever loyal assistant, and Bokeem Woodbine has never been better than he is as Fathead Newman.  I wish we could have seen more of the youthful vigor and energy that Larenz Tate brings to the role of Quincy Jones.  Aunjanue Ellis is also very effective as one of Ray's mistresses, Mary Ann Fisher.Kerry Washington is fabulous as Della Bea, Ray's long suffering and put-upon wife.  The scene when she explains to Ray that their newborn son is not a gift from her to him and how his life on the road must not find its way in the home she is making for their family is powerful and the scene when Ray tells her of the death of Margie Hendrix is just as stunning.  Washington is an incredible actress and ""Ray"" lets her shine!Finally, there aren't enough words to champion the vastly underrated Regina King.  Her name MUST be called with Jamie Foxx's the day Oscar nominations are announced in January.  Her Margie Hendrix is a blistering hybrid of passion, weakness, love and compassion, and every emotion is firmly etched on King's face.  The ""Hit the Road Jack"" scene is so raw and painful, and King matches Foxx's performance emotion for emotion, word for word, pain for pain, blues for blues.  Regina King is a miracle worker, and it is high time she is acknowledged for the incredible work she is contributing to American film.  Please remember this performance at Oscar time!!!!!Please see ""Ray.""  All of the actors in the film deserve your support.

His two Oscar nominations this year - Best Supporting Actor for ""Collateral"" and Best Actor for THIS movie - are well deserved.  The man can ACT.  He is so successful at inhabiting a role here - I wouldn't bat an eye if I heard he were playing Ronald Reagan in an upcoming film.Ray Charles was also a stunning once-in-a-lifetime talent, and the combination of Foxx's ability working with the Charles' material is extremely pleasurable.Jamie Foxx so completely inhabits the personna of Ray Charles that disbelief is totally suspended.  In our minds he IS Ray Charles.All that being said - it's impossible to make a coherent ""story"" from 20 years of disconnected interludes and anecdotes from Ray's life.  We see young Ray growing up with a mother who wants more for her son than the poverty he is born into.  She challenges him in ways that border on cruelty after he becomes blind, but the movie suggests that it is the hard lessons he learned while young that drove him to greatness later.We see the young musician Ray, winning the respect and adulation of fans and musicians alike while playing Country, then blending Blues and Gospel to make Soul music.  We see Ray the long-time heroin addict who doesn't think it is a ""problem"" as long as he keeps his musical engagements.  We see Ray the womanizer who doesn't think it is a ""problem"" as long as it only happens on the road.  We see Ray the astute businessman who learns to accept his early cash payments in ones - so that he won't be underpaid - and later negotiates a recording deal ""better than Sinatra's"".  We see the Ray that understands that his music plays well in the south, and continues to play in venues that more progressive black musicians like Quincy Jones won't play.  We also see the Ray who finally understands the wrongness of segregated music halls and takes a stand that no musician before had made - resulting in him being banned from the big money state of Georgia.  We see the proud Ray who is invited back to the Capital of Georgia for an official apology.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[1, 2]","This film tells us the story of the first 40 years in the life of Ray Charles Robinson (1930-2004), a well-known American musician and composer. The actor that plays Ray Charles is Jamie Foxx, and sincerely, you forget that he is playing a role because after a few minutes of watching the movie you begin to believe that he IS Ray Charles. I guess that nothing better can be said in behalf of an actor...You might be asking yourself what kind of movie is this. Well, in my opinion it is an excellent one, due to the fact that it entertains but also informs the spectator about another era, and a musician that lived in it. That is specially important in the case of young movie-goers, who aren't necessarily aware of what segregatation was like in the 50's, or what kind of gestures were needed to bring it down. You may have read about it in history books, but seeing it shown in a good film makes you understand segregation in its stark reality, and thank to God (and people like Ray, and many others) that times have changed.But what about Ray?. Impossible as it may seem to many, some people (me included) didn't know much about him before seeing this film. If that is the case, this movie is the right way to be introduced to this American music legend, because it pictures Ray as a person with lots of virtues, but also many defects. He is shown as brave enough to overcome the difficulties that arose from the fact that he was blind and black (in times when segregation was a reality in the south of USA), and to pursue his dream of becoming a well-known musician. However, we also see his struggles with drug, and the less than stellar way in which he treated the women in his life (for example his wife, played by Kerry Washington, and his mistress, played by Regina King). He is flawed, but capable of gestures that make him great, for instance refusing to sing in places where the audience was segregated. He was somewhat self-absorbed, but he was a musical genius that created his own style and helped to develop soul music..As we watch ""Ray"", we are allowed to accompany him in a travel through his memories, from his days as a young boy living with his mother (played by Sharon Warren), to the days when he had already achieved great fame but had many problems dealing with it. The director (Taylor Hackford) manages to do that aided by the songs Ray Charles composed at different times in his career, an interesting way to link different events of significance in Ray's life.On the whole, I can say that this is the kind of movie you must see. If you are already a Ray Charles' fan, you will love this movie about his life. If you aren't, you are highly likely to become one.

Ray Charles, as portrayed brilliantly in this movie by Jaime Foxx, was incredibly talented, but he was kind of a jerk in some ways, particularly his womanizing.  What the film doesn't mention is that he actually had 12 children, 1 from his first wife and 3 by his second wife, both marriages ending in divorce.In my opinion, a more interesting story line involves Ray's mother, who died when Ray was a teenager (after a difficult life, as portrayed in this film).  You get her story ""between the lines"" as the film flashes back on Ray's difficult childhood -- a childhood so poor that it is miraculous that he survived and was able to accomplish so much, thanks to his strong as iron mother.I highly recommend this film -- I could easily imagine watching it again and again.",5,I can see why this movie was nominated for an Oscar,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,1038,"['So', 'often', 'biography', 'films', 'lack', 'certain', 'something', 'usually', 'message', 'central', 'theme', 'other', 'person', 'movie', 'Pollack', 'being', 'very', 'talented', 'person', 'personal', 'issues', 'cause', 'problems', 'people', 'life', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'portrayed', 'brilliantly', 'movie', 'Jaime', 'Foxx', 'was', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'was', 'kind', 'jerk', 'ways', 'particularly', 'womanizing', 'What', 'film', ""n't"", 'mention', 'actually', 'had', '12', 'children', '1', 'first', 'wife', '3', 'second', 'wife', 'marriages', 'ending', 'divorce.In', 'opinion', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'Ray', 'mother', 'who', 'died', 'when', 'Ray', 'was', 'teenager', 'difficult', 'life', 'portrayed', 'film', 'get', 'story', 'lines', 'film', 'flashes', 'back', 'Ray', 'difficult', 'childhood', 'childhood', 'so', 'poor', 'miraculous', 'survived', 'was', 'able', 'accomplish', 'so', 'much', 'thanks', 'strong', 'iron', 'mother.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'imagine', 'watching', 'again', 'again']",Ray

If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, there should be an investigation!  Who knew he had it in him?

A classic performance.My wife made an interesting observation while watching ""Ray"".  It's amazing that Ray Charles never overdosed in all those years of shooting heroin, alone in a hotel room more often than not, probably.  He couldn't see how much he was cooking!  Someone must have been watching over him.Look, just buy this DVD.

The movie retells a portion of Ray's life during the period when he was hooked on drugs.  There was no struggle to remove drugs from his life because it wasn't until very much later in life that he finally decided to kick the habit.  His struggle to attain stardom in the early years is portrayed well by Foxx.  Along with drugs is his uncontrolable appetite for women and his affairs, before and after he was married, were many.  His wife put up with the affairs and the children born out of wedlock.At times the movie becomes tedious as we watch Foxx contort his face and body to imitate Ray.  One gets a little weary after a while even though Foxx's portrayal is flawless.  We see the loss of his only brother and his mother sending him off to the blind school even though he didn't want to be separtated from his mother.  We learn of the demons that followed and haunted Ray all of his life.Foxx does not sing but instead lip sincs to tracks.  A wise choice since even the best mimicks of the day have not been able to master Ray Charles voice.  Harry Lennix (The Matrix Reloaded & The Matrix Revolutions) enters the film after Ray's success as his new manager.  Lennix seems to excel at every role he touches.  His performances are always on point.  The cast in general does a good job of portraying Ray's little circle of bandmates.  If you are a Ray Charles fan you  should see this film.  Foxx just may win the Oscar with this performance.  A true test of Foxx's talents though, will be another role in which he has to act more than imitate.

Like someone posted earlier, When viewing the ""extended"" version my player had to pause every time it went to a ""deleted scene."" It had to pause again when it went back to the theatrical version. I have other disks in my collection which have extended versions with deleted scenes cut into the film that were done seamlessly.Not only was there a pause when switching between versions, but many times there was a shift in color cast and certain chapters (18 & 19 for me)of the movie became unwatchable and just froze up. For 30 Bucks I found this to be disgraceful and I will ask Best Buy for either another copy or just get the standard edition..You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this ""extended"" version.

Being a jazz enthusiast, I naturally went out to buy the movie as soon as it came out, which is a rarity for me considering I never got the chance to see it when it was in theaters.  While it was over 2 1/2 hours in length, it was an enthralling 2 1/2 hours as you saw RAY go through psychological issues, inner demons, and relationships. While this movie does feature Ray's musical genius, it encompasses more importantly Ray's social issues and Ray's life and how he ended up cleaning up his life from a long drug habit and etc.  Jamie Foxx did an exceptional job portraying RAY and I think that that is some of the best, most convincing acting 1) Jamie Foxx has ever done and 2) One of the best acting jobs any actor did in the year 2004.  Seeing Ray perform in Jazz documentaries and on television, Foxx nailed Charles's mannerisms with incredible accuracy that stunned me.  I think that Foxx is very oscar worthy as the definition of Best actor should be based on the criteria of an actor/actress going out of their ""comfort zone"" (which is comedy for Foxx).  Excellent movie and it taught me so much that I didn't know about Ray Charles's life.  Furthermore, the flashbacks to Charles's childhood were very, very effective.

629449,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005JND5,Michael Butts,"[1, 1]","...for you are destined to win this year's Best Actor Oscar for this incredible performance.  Foxx is so good that I too actually forgot I wasn't watching the real Ray Charles.  Jamie inhabits the role so intensely one can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  Under masterful direction from Taylor Hackford, RAY is an excellent biopic, whose only fault in my opinion is its length; it seems to go on forever.  But during the time spent with the movie, you are treated to some of Ray Charles' most endearing songs; a tightly focused script featuring superb performances from the supporting cast including Kerry Washington, Regina King, David Krumholtz, Bokeem Woodbine and countless others.  The period detail is impeccable:  costuming, vehicles, everything seems like it came right out of the fifties and sixties.  I don't know the name of the actress who played Ray's mother, but she is wonderful in a fiercely determined performance.  Ray is a legend, conquering all the major fields of contemporary music, showing that an r&b singer can have pop hits, even country hits as demonstrated in his awesome renditions of I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU and BORN TO LOSE. And the picture doesn't sanitize his faults and weaknesses:  he was a womanizer and his addiction to heroin could have ended his career.  It is ironic that after he conquered this addiction, his stance in the recording industry lessened; seemed he did his best work while high.  But as the movie depicts, Ray's conquering of his personal demons kept his family together, and after tonight's six posthumous Grammys, one can say Ray and his music lives on.

It totally felt like you were watching the life of Ray Charles.  The movie was cool because I learned so much I did not know.  I have listened to a little Ray Charles, as most people have.  I enjoy his innovative R & B and Gospel Sound.  One of the qualities the film promotes well, something I had known, is the excellent versatility and range of styles Charles could play.I really was not aware how much of how much a junkie and drug abuser the singer really was.  The film really did a great job in capturing the severe faults of the artist as well as capturing the ways he overcame his obstacles.  All of the acting was superb, and Jamie Fox really really shines, showing his amazing talent.  So much of film is pure junk but I no doubt feel this feature adds a lot to the life of Charles and the potential for films.The actress who played Charles wife and mother also did excellent jobs, as well as the fellow who played Quincy Jones.  Even more could have been added but I also understand the reasons for editing for time.  I liked the scene at the end with the Georgia State Legislators.  Julian Bond is a punk though, too bad he has to be such a political hack.

THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS ME FROM GIVING THIS OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PIECE OF FILM 5 STARS IS THE FACT THAT IT'S JUST A TAD BIT TOO LONG.

629452,AW99SBGWEXP0J,B00005JND5,Michael Zuffa,"[0, 0]","""Ray"" is the story of Ray Charles from when, at the age of 21, he left home for Seattle to play in a lounge club to the time he gives up drugs for good about two decades later.  He starts out small, but clearly gifted.  People try to take advantage of his blindness, but he always finds a way around this, including demanding to be paid in singles.  As his star begins to rise, he finds love, drugs, and a mistress.  He even gets banned from playing in Georgia.  I knew very little about Ray Charles, and I found the details of his life (although tweaked for the movie) to be fascinating.Jamie Foxx disappears into the character of Ray Charles.  He looks, sounds, and moves like Ray to the point where he is almost indistinguishable from the real deal.  This is his second solid performance of the year (see also ""Collateral""), and he is almost certainly guaranteed a Best Actor nomination.  His performance is what makes this movie worth seeing.  It is far superior to the movie itself, which is lacking and feels somewhat incomplete and choppy, not to mention long.  That's not to say ""Ray"" is a bad movie - it isn't.  It is just not as good as it could be, and given Foxx's performance, that is a shame.",4,Ray,1102550400,"12 9, 2004",2004,1206,"['Ray', 'story', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'when', 'age', '21', 'left', 'home', 'Seattle', 'play', 'lounge', 'club', 'time', 'up', 'drugs', 'good', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'out', 'small', 'clearly', 'gifted', 'People', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', 'blindness', 'always', 'way', 'including', 'demanding', 'be', 'paid', 'singles', 'star', 'rise', 'love', 'drugs', 'mistress', 'even', 'banned', 'playing', 'Georgia', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'found', 'details', 'life', 'tweaked', 'movie', 'be', 'fascinating.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'character', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'moves', 'Ray', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'indistinguishable', 'real', 'deal', 'second', 'solid', 'performance', 'year', 'see', 'also', 'Collateral', 'almost', 'certainly', 'guaranteed', 'Best', 'Actor', 'nomination', 'performance', 'what', 'movie', 'seeing', 'far', 'superior', 'movie', 'lacking', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'incomplete', 'choppy', 'not', 'mention', 'long', 'not', 'say', 'Ray', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'given', 'Foxx', 'performance', 'shame']",Ray
629453,AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,B00005JND5,"MickeyMoose15 ""jakastner""","[2, 5]","It was tremendously heart-breaking for America to have lost not only one, but two cultural icons that had had profound impacts on the people of our nation - Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles - die within a week of each other. Unfortunately, Ray Charles' sudden passing, which occurred on June 10th, was slightly over-shadowed by the funeral processions of the late-president, but he was hardly forgotten, nor will he ever be thanks to the landmark impact he left, not only on his own, but on the current generation of artists as well. There are certainly substantial arguments over the current direction that many believe the music industry is heading toward at this moment in time but what can be said, together, is that Ray Charles will be forever remembered for leaving an influential mark on the music industry and broke barriers in order for the current generation of supposedly ""musically inclined"" teen-poppers to express their own voice in the world today.The story charts the life and career of the pioneering musical sensation Ray Charles, who passed away this past summer at the age of seventy-four after primary production had been completed on the biography. Born in a poor black neighborhood of Albany, Georgia in 1930, Ray Charles Robinson never imagined the extraordinary life he would lead, but it wouldn't come easy for either him or his family and not without heavy costs in return. After the accidental death of his younger brother, Ray began to go blind starting at the age of seven and his mother, a fiercely independent and strong black woman, helped him develop his other abilities in order to better adapt to his changing environment. Ray's true gift lied with his ability to take ordinary gospel and jazz music and turn it into something spectacular, as was demonstrated by the unprecedented number of his hits he obtained in an astounding number of genres, practically unthinkable for a musician in his day. Despite marrying a beautiful former singer and having two children as well as all the wealth and fame he could have ever imagined, Ray Charles for years battled with his inner demons, including his excessive womanizing while on the road and his growing heroin addiction, as well as the psychotic side effects that haunted him for years and nearly ended the long standing career he had fought so hard for. The story for Ray should be commemorated for doing what so few bio-pictures have actually done, which is to tell the whole story, including the good times, the bad, and the down-right ugly, and unfortunately the latter may be the reason the feature's rating gets knocked down a few notches in the end. It's important that Ray Charles' incessant heroin addiction and womanizing are the primary focus of the film, as they were the demons that consumed a large portion of his life and career, but after about two hours it becomes a little depressing. This is hardly a call-to-arms for the ""hippie-dippy"" view of Mr. Charles' life story but it would have been nice had some time been set aside to look at the events of his life ranging from the mid-1970s to the time of his death in the summer of 2004.As is so often the case with biographical features, don't be expecting a star-studded cast - the primary focus is, and always should be, the story's main component and nothing should distract from that, which remains true for this one as well. Let's end the discussion here and now. The votes have already been tallied up - Forget those damn recounts, honestly if people don't know how to properly fill out an election ballot in this day and age then they deserve what-ever they get -  The winner for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards will be Jamie Foxx. To be true, Foxx was cheated out of a golden-statuette for his role in the critically-acclaimed comedy Booty Call but with this one practically in the bag, all is forgiven to be sure. Seriously, Jamie Foxx gives the performance of a life-time as the legendary Ray Charles and, considering he spent numerous hours with the man himself prior to his death, nothing he does in the film seems off-key or out of place. This is one of those rare occasions in the history of cinema where witnessing a film is called for principally for the sake of one actor's astonishing performance and Foxx's take on the late-Ray Charles is it. One can picture Kerry Washington's Della Bea Robinson, the wife of Ray Charles, in comparison to Jacqueline Kennedy, another spouse of a famous figure of American culture whose ""dabbling"" in the areas of drugs and women severely affected life back home. She works well with the limited screen time she's given but one has to remember that the primary focus should be on Ray specifically, so it was expected that less time would be spent on the supporting characters. And Sharon Warren, who is an apparent newcomer to the Hollywood scene according to IMDB, does an incredible job with the role of Ray's fiercely independent mother, Aretha Robinson, and reflects perfectly a woman struggling to go through life in a world she is well aware is far from fair, having her youngest son unexpectedly taken away from her and raising a blind child alone in a poor southern neighborhood. She quickly adapts her experience in life and embeds them in the young Ray in order to prevent others from treating him merely as a cripple. Unfortunately what Ray forgets along the way is that it isn't others he should be concerned about treating him as anything other then a blind-black man, it should be himself as well.Overall, Ray, in the same captivating way as the inspirational artist on which it is based, breaks away from the conventional norms, too often tied down by an over-burdening sense of political correctness, and drastically alters the way we look at the biography genre. As instrumental as the feature may be, it does have its fair share of problems that hinder it enough to prevent a spectacular rating from being given to it. First off, an annoying aspect of the feature was Hackford's constant use of flashbacks to Ray's early childhood in Albany, Georgia during the middle of several scenes throughout the movie. It would have been better had Hackford played the story of Ray Charles straight-up instead of having to resort to using ridiculous, and repeatedly awkward, flashbacks that frequently distract the audience from the current conflicts as hand. With a running time of slightly over two hours and thirty minutes, director Taylor Hackford seems to be biting off more then he can chew and gives the audience the feeling as though he is cramming too much into one film. The flow of the film may have been better had he given the thought of chopping a few unnecessary sequences in order to shorten it up a bit. And finally, the less then spectacular finale to the musical biography leaves something desperately to be desired. Giving benefit to the doubt due to the fact that Ray Charles died shortly after primary shooting had been completed on the film, the filmmakers may have been confused as to how to properly end the feature now that he had passed away. It doesn't give them a total free-pass for ending it as flatly as they did but it is, at the very least, understandable. There are, ultimately, two distinct factors that should convince you to see this film - its rocking soundtrack and the astonishing performance of comedian Jamie Foxx. The soundtrack, though, should be disqualified since anyone can just as easily purchase it either on a compact disc or download it offline (a free version was available on AOL Music at the time of this publishing) but Foxx's breakthrough performance is unlike anything seen in years and should be seen for yourself to be thoroughly convinced. Despite some minor squabbles with particular methods used by the filmmakers, it is to be sure that Ray Charles is looking down on this film at this moment and giving it, as well as the talented cast and crew who worked diligently to make this as truthful and entertaining as possible, his blessing.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Ray' on Our Minds,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,8015,"['was', 'tremendously',

629454,A1FG91CM8221X1,B00005JND5,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 3]","Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" is an often riveting, wonderfully acted biopic centered by Jamie Foxx's extraordinary turn as a great American original, Ray Charles. To play a public figure who is so idiosyncratic in appearance and manner, and so fresh in the public memory, is the thespian equivalent of taming lions: if you don't get eaten by the role, the performance is considered a success. Foxx not only doesn't get devoured, he saddles up the lion and rides it around the arena. He captures Charles' vocal and physical mannerisms perfectly, but even more, he shows us the complicated, tortured inner life of a man who battled tragedy from his earliest days. This isn't an impression of Charles, but a full-blooded, three-dimensional performance by a master actor. I can think of only one previous performance that compares with it: Kurt Russell's performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's 1979 TV-movie. And Foxx enjoys one enormous advantage over Russell: whereas Carpenter's film was pretty much a whitewash of Elvis, Hackford's portrait of Charles is warts-and-all, allowing Foxx ample access to Charles' dark side. The music is wall-to-wall, as you would expect, and since it's Charles' own singing and playing mimed by Foxx, it's the best. Yet despite the film's length and detail, it feels incomplete and slightly bitter at the end, glossing over Charles' last four decades with a few captions and some brief footage of Charles himself in his later years. We get closure as to one of Charles' major problems (heroin addiction) but not as to others (his compulsive womanizing and often callous treatment of lovers, family and friends). It makes us feel that what the movie doesn't show us must have been REALLY awful! But this deficiency in the movie can't be laid at Foxx's door. Though Foxx is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, there are plenty of other Oscar-worthy performances in the film, particularly by the women: Sharon Watkins as Charles' mother; Kerry Washington as his long-suffering wife, Della Bea; and Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis as women who shared a bed as well as a stage with Charles. I must also put in a good word for young C.J. Sanders, who gives a tremendously skillful and touching performance as the seven-year-old Ray.",4,Extraordinary performances by Jamie Foxx and others.,1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,2259,"['Taylor', 'Hackford', 'Ray', 'often', 'riveting', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'biopic', 'centered', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'extraordinary', 'turn', 'great', 'American', 'original', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'play', 'public', 'figure', 'who', 'so', 'idiosyncratic', 'appearance', 'manner', 'so', 'fresh', 'public', 'memory', 'thespian', 'equivalent', 'taming', 'lions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'eaten', 'role', 'performance', 'considered', 'success', 'Foxx', 'not', 'only', ""n't"", 'get', 'devoured', 'up', 'lion', 'arena', 'Charles', 'vocal', 'physical', 'mannerisms', 'perfectly', 'even', 'more', 'complicated', 'tortured', 'inner', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'battled', 'tragedy', 'earliest', 'days', ""n't"", 'impression', 'Charles', 'full-blooded', 'three-dimensional', 'performance', 'master', 'actor', 'can', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'previous', 'performance', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'performance', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'John', 'Carpenter', '1979', 'TV-movie', 'Foxx', 'one', 'enormous', 'advantage', 'Russell', 'whereas', 'Carpenter', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'whitewash', 'Elvis', 'Hackford', 'portrait', 'Charles', 'warts-and-all', 'allowing', 'Foxx', 'ample', 'access', 'Charles', 'dark', 'side', 'music', 'wall-to-wall', 'would', 'expect', 'Charles', 'own', 'singing', 'playing', 'mimed', 'Foxx', 'best', 'film', 'length', 'detail', 'incomplete', 'slightly', 'bitter', 'end', 'glossing', 'Charles', 'last', 'four', 'decades', 'few', 'captions', 'brief', 'footage', 'Charles', 'later', 'years', 'get', 'closure', 'one', 'Charles', 'major', 'problems', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'not', 'others', 'compulsive', 'womanizing', 'often', 'callous', 'treatment', 'lovers', 'family', 'friends', 'feel', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'show', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'REALLY', 'awful', 'deficiency', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'laid', 'Foxx', 'door', 'Foxx', 'shoo-in', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'film', 'particularly', 'women', 'Sharon', 'Watkins', 'Charles', 'mother', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Della', 'Bea', 'Regina', 'King', 'Aunjanue', 'Ellis', 'women', 'who', 'shared', 'bed', 'as', 'well', 'stage', 'Charles', 'must', 'also', 'put', 'good', 'word', 'young', 'C.J', 'Sanders', 'who', 'tremendously', 'skillful', 'touching', 'performance', 'seven-year-old', 'Ray']",Ray
629455,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JND5,mirasreviews,"[5, 8]","""Ray"" is the story of the life and career of singer/pianist Ray Charles, whose music crossed charts, cultures and generations of fans. This is a straightforward biopic, but it's a good one, driven by an impressive lead performance, bolstered by a talented supporting cast, and punctuated with great music. ""Ray"" follows Charles' professional progress and personal life from 1948, when he played with a jazz trio in Seattle that led to his first record contract, through his emerging career and success with Atlantic Records in the 1950s, to his move to ABC and international fame in the 1960s. Periodic flashbacks reveal the formative events of Charles' childhood in rural Florida, where he was raised by his poor but resolute mother who had the heartbreaking misfortune to lose one child and watch helplessly as the other went blind.Before settling on a style -or styles- of his own, Ray Charles claimed he could mimic just about anybody. Jamie Foxx's performance would have done him proud. It doesn't just involve mimicry, of course; Foxx gets at Ray Charles' underlying ambitions, fears, and faults. But Ray Charles' mannerisms and voice are distinctive, and Foxx adopts them naturally. Blind since he was 7 years old, but never lacking in wit or ambition, Charles talked himself into opportunities that no one wanted to give him. I found it interesting that being blind put him at a disadvantage, not so much because he couldn't see, but because it caused an inordinate number of people to try to take advantage of him. Ray Charles had great talent and a sharp business sense that served him well. He navigated using his extraordinary hearing instead of a cane or guide dog. He was gutsy when he pioneered a rousing blend of gospel and blues, and then again when he gave the same fans a country & western album. He was that rare musician who could change genres, pursue his artistic impulses, and keep his audience. But the most courageous thing he ever did may have been early in his career: Touring with a band in strange cities, Ray Charles' blindness made him constantly dependent on people whom he couldn't trust. He used heroin to cope with the stress, which eventually became an impediment.

Had he become a beggar I doubt anyone would have blamed him, but thanks to his mother and much later his wife, he became one of the best known musicians in America.This is an inspirational story about a flawed man. He had addictions - heroine and women, and many times overlooked those who loved him the most. But he overcame these obstacles as well and freed himself from the grips of heroine and (one would like to think since the movie doesn't tell us) from easy women.Unfortunately, the pace of this movie is quite slow and so may not appeal to everyone.

The wait was well worth it - this is a terrific biopic - but not just a biopic, this is an outstanding movie on any terms.Whether a fan or not (I wasn't) most everyone will be aware at some level of Ray Charles' music. He's made that big an impact. This movie endeavours to show two periods of his life. The principal part of the movie follows his rise to fame, and corresponding fall into drug use and infidelity, climaxing in his redemption, kicking the habit, and recommitting his lfe as a husband and an entertainer. The second strand is told in flashback, showing Ray as a boy, before and during the process of him becoming blind - explaining (perhaps a little too neatly for some peoples taste) his need to escape into drugs, and how he managed to overcome the constraints of blindness with the help of his mothers tough guidance. His mother is clearly the key character in his life, teaching him firmly but with love how to enhance his sense of hearing and touch in order to compensate for his blindness. His mothers words echo frequently through the movuie when she says, 'Always remember your promise to me. Never let nobody or nothing turn you into no cripple.'. These two tales interweave almost seamlessly, showing not just the facts but the effects on the older man of the younger mans history. As an adult, the cinematography might be beautiful and the tones warm and rich, but Ray the man is shown warts and all - this is a man who used people shamelessly, not least the women in his life, and the movie does not shirk from showing him in those terms. This has the effect of really drawing you in. Instead of a whitewashed version of his life, you feel you are scratching the surface of a person just a little here, and it makes for fascinating viewing because it rings true.Taylor Hackford the director has done an incredible job of creating striking visuals, from the dusty ochre coloured streets of his youth, through to smoky bars, and on to the over the top glitz of LA and swanky nightclubs - all the period settings ring true and are shot to perfection. You can tell this was a labour of love - in fact, Hackford bought the rights to the story back in 1987, but could not find a studio release - it was only after independent financing that Universal studio stepped in to facilitate its release. It must be a matter of some satisfaction to him that Ray Charles was able to see the first edit of the movie before he died, before the movie was actually released.Then there is the acting - much has been said of Jamie Foxx's acting here, and it's all true- he embodies the part in a way which is uncanny - his efforts, going to Braille school, wearing prosthetics which made him blind during shooting, studying Ray Charles himself, have really paid off.

I can't say that I've been such a big fan of Ray Charles and his music but this movie has placed the man squarely on the mind.  There is a powerful story to be told in Ray Charles life but more than that this movie connects with audiences due to the essence of the music combined with one really powerful and believable performance by Foxx.What held this back from a five-star review is that the scenes in which Charles' Mom appears come across as too one-dimensional.  The acting between the lady playing Charles' mother and the children seemed forced and put-on.  It reminded me of a made-for-TV movie and too much was made of Ray's demons being tied to his early childhood experiences with the accidental death of his younger brother.  But don't let this minor detractor distract you from the powerfully told tale of a person overcoming seemingly overwhelming odds to make it in the world.You will completely forget that Jamie Foxx is playing Ray and the actual persona is brought to life on the screen in front of you.  The music drives the movie and you will find yourself impossibly moving along to the gospel R&B; fueled tunes gaining an appreciation for the life of Ray Charles.

I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx's BUT NOW with Collateral, Redemption, and Ray... Jamie DESERVES TO CARRY AWAY A TON OF OSCARS!This isn't a MERE impersonation of Ray Charles.  Jamie Foxx provides one of ""THE BEST PERFORMANCES"" I have ever witnessed!It's a remarkable summary of Ray's early childhood where he witnessed the death of his younger brother and gradually the loss of his sight; his musical career from 1948 until the mid-1960s; and his heroin addiction.This eye opening drama shows you Ray Charles strengths as a musical innovator, and also his weaknesses as a womanizer and a heroin addict.My heart ached, and rejoiced all through this movie.  I cried, laughed, and cheered.  Hurting for how he was mistreated, how he had to suffer.  But then how he himself mistreated people.  Watching as he fought through bigotry being both a blind man as well as a black man along with his increasingly growing drug addiction.  How lonely it must've been for Ray with the nightmares, and being there in the dark!The ENTIRE CAST was great.  Ellis, and Regina King were both great ""leading ladies"" I also like that Clifton Powell wasn't a bad guy in this one.  The scenes were perfect to that period, the suits, the cars, and furniture.This story is so compelling, I just can't imagine people not feeling THE FULL EFFECT of Ray Charles!

629467,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00005JND5,Nicholas Carroll,"[2, 5]","Jamie Foxx more than earned his recent Best Actor Oscar win with this brilliant portrayal of the one and only musical genius of Ray Charles.  Perhaps more than Denzel Washington as Malcolm X, Lawrence Fishburne as Ike Turner, Angela Bassett as Tina Turner, or Will Smith as Mohammed Ali...Foxx's performance made me forget that it was anyone other than Ray Charles himself on the silver screen.  To call it merely an ""impersonation"" is to belittle a skill that many actors can't pull off.  Watch ""Saturday Night Live"" for impersonations of famous people, but can any of those actors carry an entire film, causing the viewer to forget that its merely an impersonation and getting absorbed as though we are watching Ray Charles' life play out before our very eyes.I read some critiques of this film suffering from the usual bio-pic pitfalls of what angle to present a famous person's life story and where to begin and end such a film.  This film does everything right in terms of how a bio-pic should be made and the creative license that convey a person's inner demons was well done in this film.  The flashback sequences were well done and weren't confusing, and they helped the viewer understand the underlying motives of a childhood tragedy and how it helped create the person Ray Charles came to be.What I loved most was seeing just why Ray Charles was considered a genius, as he knew when to move on to bigger and greener pastures with an impeccable sense of timing and what he is owed.  He could easily have wasted years if not decades at the hands of some craven club owners in Seattle who knew they had a rare and profitable talent on their hands and weren't thinking in his best interest, but their own greed.  People might have thought they could pull things over a blind man's head, but he always got the last laugh.That's not to say that he was a perfect man.  The scenes of implied heroin use were heartbreaking, but redemption comes in the end when an arrest and drug treatment forces him to face his demons once and for all to kick his habit.  The scenes of his going cold turkey should be a warning lesson to anyone considering using drugs without regard to aftereffects.  That Ray Charles kicked his habit cold turkey and never relapsed is another testament to his genius.What got the most laughs and applause in theaters where I saw it, was when Ray Charles refused to perform in a segregated venue in Georgia, causing the state to ban him for life.  The irony of it all as we watch the film in 2004/2005 is that we know that his ""Georgia On My Mind"" is the official state song of our state and he was given the hero's welcome in the state capitol in 1979.This film is an impressive tribute to one of the greatest musical geniuses of our time and worth seeing and owning in your personal dvd collection.  If you buy this dvd, you'll probably want the cd soundtracks as well...as the first thing I did after seeing this movie was running out to buy a greatest hits cd since I regrettably didn't have a single Ray Charles cd in my collection.  That'll change after seeing the movie.

629468,A1129LM24YWSZV,B00005JND5,"Nicole Bradshaw ""Nicole Bradshaw""","[0, 1]","Ray, starring Jamie Foxx, chronicles the life and career of Ray Charles, the legendary piano player and jazz/blues/country singer. Charles went blind from glaucoma when he was about seven years old, but the film illustrates how he overcame that obstacle, as well as many others, to forge a very successful career in show business. The movie also tells the story of Charles' triumph over drug addiction.The film makes liberal use of Charles' recordings, and I found myself dancing around my living room during some of the band scenes! The music is truly so intoxicating that it's difficult to sit still. I also especially loved the flashbacks to Charles' rural childhood, and how all of those scenes seemed to be shot in such bright contrasting colors - the red clay of the earth, the bright green of the grass, the multi-hued bottle trees. It made sense to me that, remembering, Charles would recall the world in such color.In addition, the period feel of the movie is carefully portrayed. Because all of the movie takes place before 1979 (and most of it takes place in the 50's and 60's), set designers, costumers, and props masters had their work cut out for them. All the visuals in this movie feel very authentic. These people did their homework.Jamie Foxx won an Oscar for his performance as Charles, and it was definitely well-deserved. I really enjoyed the fact that this movie did not sugar-coat Charles' life. He was a philanderer, a drug addict, and (often) a neglectful husband. But he did love his family, and he was a musical genius. Foxx (and the script) did a wonderful job of rendering him as a whole, and somewhat flawed, character.The performances of Kerry Washington (who plays Della Charles, Ray's wife) and Regina King (Margie Hendrix, who plays one of the Raylettes that Charles becomes romantically involved with) were both especially notable. I've seen Regina King in several other films, and I've always thought she was one of the most talented actresses around.

I had read all the hype about this movie and decided that I had to see it.  Overall, it's a very good biography about a man, as it turns out, I knew very little about.  I knew him only as an old man, a family man, and a music legend.  I didn't know about his younger days: his drug addiction to heroin, his philandering ways, and the careless manner in which he handled his family.  I didn't know that he had been born with sight and lost it at a young age, or that he had had such a strong determined mother.  It was very interesting to see what he went through on his way to stardom, from all the good things that happened to him to all the bad choices he made along the way.  Although I'm not sure if I would deem this movie ""Oscar-worthy,"" I readily admit that it was a moving film - and as I said before, a VERY good biography that shares with us plenty of Ray's music to enjoy along the way.  Jamie Foxx was fantastic - I never knew he could act that well!  This movie was a very good showing of his capabilities as an actor.

Mattocks,"[8, 8]","I somehow missed this at the movies but I was determined with all the Oscar buzz and hype Jamie Foxx was receiving, that I'd buy it and form my own opinion. I have to give it up for Jamie Foxx, he just didn't play Ray Charles, he practically was Ray Charles.  His acting was just absolutely flawless.  The supporting cast of Clifton Powell, Regina King, Kelly Washington, Larenz Tate, Bokeem Woodbine, and the newcomer who played his mother (I forgot her name that quick) who's never been in anything outside of a local theatre when discovered, all did a marvelous job as well.  I was never a really big Ray Charles fan but I loved the music in the film.  However, the big disappointment for me was buying the Limited Edition version with the extended edition of the movie.  Like someone posted earlier, When viewing the ""extended"" version my player had to pause every time it went to a ""deleted scene."" It had to pause again when it went back to the theatrical version.  I have other disks in my collection which have extended versions with deleted scenes cut into the film that were done seamlessly.Not only was there a pause when switching between versions, but many times there was a shift in color cast and certain chapters (18 & 19 for me)of the movie became unwatchable and just froze up.  For 30 Bucks I found this to be disgraceful and I will ask Best Buy for either another copy or just get the standard edition.  The special features on Disc 2 were excellent including the uncut performances that were cut short in the original film and the meeting of Foxx and Charles in a studio in 2002 to see if Foxx met Ray's approval (which it obviously did).  Foxx is not only a talented actor, but an extremely gifted pianist come to find out. The sky's the limit for this brother and I hope he comes away with the Oscar cuz his performance again was flawless.  I'd suggest buying the standard edition just to avoid all the nonsense I had to go through with extended edition.  If not for the sorry DVD transfer this would easily been a five star classic.  Who knows maybe they'll do like everyone else and come out with another edition with better film transfer.

It would be easy, on such a mercurial trip, to put the pedal to the floor on Charles's legendary sexual and heroin excesses. Yet, at no point, did I wince at possible gratuitous, myth-making with a sense of overkill. The bonus disc has Charles coaching Foxx on piano, and of course, this is the lynch pin to the success of the movie, the fact that the actor isn't acting the music. He's not Ray Charles. But he is an actual musician and thus gives the director the benefit of being able to pan from keyboard shots to the musicians entranced face which enhances the sense of documentation rather than simulation. Foxx seems to have been born to this role His is a performance of supreme devotion and richly deserves the applaudits it's gathered.Ray's hunger for success and dealing with the administrative moguls is crisp without being condescending. The lads at Atlantic are given very sympathetic portraits. The retrieved early childhood scenes glove well. Whether the guilt trip over his younger sibling's drowning is valid, ostensibly Charles gave it the thumbs up.

Making your performance mimic that of a real life person with as much vitality and genius as Ray Charles would almost be an Olympian endeavor.  Maybe in twenty or so years it wouldn't be, but there are many people who have grown up with Charles' music, seen him live, and on television.Jamie Foxx worked blindfolded alongside Ray Charles to learn to play piano, walk, move like a blind man.  How he managed to imbue the role with the soul of the man, is comparable in acting to Charles' musical talent.No, the story isn't pretty.  Charles moved from alcohol to heroin with almost the same rocket-like speed as his career.  He also had affairs with his backup singers.  The movie doesn't gloss over any of this--or the dues he paid as consequences.The music is wonderful--overseen by Mr. Charles before his death, the acting is superb.

629490,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JND5,Robert Moore,"[201, 213]","This is a very good movie that houses an exceptionally great performance by Jamie Fox as music legend Ray Charles.  I must confess that as a genre, the biopic is not my favorite, especially of figures as well known as Ray Charles.  We usually receive in such films distorted portraits of them, or undeserved adulation.  RAY is one of the more balanced biopics I have seen.  Ray Charles is presented as a musical genius who had managed to overcome physical disabilities that would have stopped most others, but it doesn't attempt to mute the serious and unflattering personal moral problems he had with drugs and his exploitative treatment of women.  Nor is he revealed as a moral saint or loving person.  Though pleasant with others for the most part, Ray is shown as a proud, independent, and slightly self-absorbed, a bit selfish in his treatment of women.  As a result, Ray Charles emerges in the film as a believable human being, capable of unfortunate decisions, but also extraordinary music and the occasional powerful moral stand, such as when he refuses to perform in a racially segregated crowd in a venue in Georgia.  In fact, the film is built around three foci:  his early childhood when he witnessed the death of his younger brother and gradually lost his sight; his musical career from 1948 until the mid-1960s; and his heroin addiction.  The film ends with his overcoming his heroin addiction, which also-as numerous music critics have noted--corresponds to the end of the peak of his career as a creative musical performer.  Charles continued to make albums after getting off heroin, but all of the great songs that we associate with him were written and recorded while on heroin.  For the last forty years of his career, his sets consisted almost entirely of songs he made famous in the fifties and early sixties, with covers of songs by other musicians.  There has been a long debate as to whether his addiction somehow aided his musical creativity, but even if so, no one would have wished him to continue to endanger his health and life.Jamie Fox will without any possible doubt receive an Oscar nomination for this performance.  This is considerably more than a good impersonation of Charles:  it is almost as if Fox channels him.  As much as I loved other biopics of music legends like THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY or WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, throughout each I was conscious that Gary Busey was playing Buddy Holly and Angela Bassett playing Tina Turner.  I completely forgot that Jamie Fox was playing Ray Charles, and despite being quite familiar with him, imagined that I was actually watching Charles onscreen.  Yes, he does a killer impersonation of Charles, but he manages that first on top of that provides an amazing dramatic performance.  This is great acting, not merely a great impersonation.  The only performance of recent years of an actor portraying a prominent entertainer as superb as this is Robert Downey in CHAPLIN.I also really loved the look of the film.  Since it ended in the mid-1960s, the entire film was essentially a period film.  There was a sense of visual veracity from beginning to end.  I loved the cars, the clothes (especially the ties! - am I alone in thinking that the 1950s was the great decade for neckties?), the interior decors, the furniture.  The scenes in the shanty town where Charles was a child were very effective.The cast aside from Fox was quite strong, made up mainly of relatively unknown performers.  There were many other things to enjoy about the film.  Of course, the music is absolutely sensational, consisting either of remasters of original Ray Charles's recordings, or new recordings for which Charles provided the vocals.  I also loved the relationship in the film between Charles and Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records.  There is nothing of the stereotypical relationship between artist and executives that invests so many of the stories of musicians in the 1950s and 1960s.  Ertegun is rightfully remembered as one of the truly great figures in the recording industry, someone who was in it more for the music than for the money, and who treated his artists with a degree of respect that was too frequently absent.  The film does a good job of presenting Charles's dilemma:  ABC-Monument made him an offer that he simply couldn't refuse, yet at the same time we are all aware that Charles was, in a way, screwing Atlantic over by leaving them for ABC-Monument.  All in all, I loved this warts and all approach to the subject matter.  There is absolutely no question that Ray Charles was one of the most astonishing performers of the fifties and sixties, and doing all he did despite his blindness is an amazing saga.  He truly was a genius, even if he was a somewhat flawed person.  But you have to love the way that he managed to overcome his personal shortcomings to become not merely one of the most successful but one of the most beloved musical performers of his age.",5,A very

Foxx gives insight into the life of Ray Charles as he tours the country and becomes one of the most innovative voices ever heard in America. Not only do we see his success, but we also see the roots of Ray's inner demons, the death of his brother that he blames on himself, and his promise to his mother that he ""wouldn't let anybody turn him into no cripple."" His mother told him that just because he was blind, he wasn't stupid. We see these demons come out in Ray's startling addiction to heroin and women. Ray falls into the life of the star, shooting up all the time, and cheating on his wife even more. Ray finds he needs her as his only support in tough times. The genius of Ray is the performance given by Foxx. From the musical performances that are eerily similar to Charles, to the startlingly real example of Charles's detox, Foxx is dead on.The rest of the supporting cast is good, with an excellent Regina Washington as Ray's wife. All in all, this movie gives viewers a deeper delve into the things that haunted Ray, and how he overcame them to become the great singing sensation who produced ""What'd I Say"", ""Georgia on My Mind"", and ""Hit the Road"". Foxx deserves nothing less than an Oscar nomination, as this performance is the best I've seen in years.

629492,A11NOO384U6BTX,B00005JND5,Robin C.,"[3, 4]","How to make a movie about a legend like Ray Charles? Hard to walk the line between a maudlin soap and a superficial celebrity tell-all.Somehow, the makers of this movie found the right balance.I was surprised at what a wonderful job Jamie Foxx did--just never thought of him as a great actor. His performance of Ray suffering through heroin withdrawal was wrenching. I noticed in the closing credits that most of the musical performances were dubbed by Ray Charles's own recordings, but some of the performances were sung by Jamie Foxx himself; darned if I could tell the difference!As far as biopics go, I felt this movie had considerable depth. They did not gloss over how Ray treated his family and his drug problems, yet they treated him respectfully with some understanding of the pressures and tragedy of his childhood that led him to do the things he did. Foxx did a great job at making the character appealing despite his flaws. I'll admit I pulled out my hanky for a couple of tearful moments near the end. I left the theater feeling uplifted. I'd like to see it again.Powerful performances by some of the supporting cast: Sharon Warren (a beautiful woman), playing Ray's mother, created a beautiful portrait of a poor but proud woman who stood up for herself. Ray went blind at the age of 7, but his mother forced him to stand on his own two feet and to take life on his own terms. ""Promise me you'll never let anyone make you a cripple!""Recognize one of the Atlantic Records executives, Jerry Wexler? He's Richard Schiff (Toby) from TV's West Wing. Looks a little different with hair and no beard!Tremendous performance from Kerry Washington as Ray's wife--a strong and proud woman who rises above Ray's road romances.On a technical note, the production design of the movie was superb.

629495,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JND5,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 2]","****1/2One of the top films of 2004, ""Ray"" is a stellar biopic that charts the life and career of one of the certified musical legends of the twentieth century.  Ray Charles was a man who battled bigotry, blindness and his own personal demons to find fame, fortune and a place in the history books as one of the world`s premier entertainers, leaving behind him a legacy of great music that is as powerful today as it was when he originally recorded it.Structurally, the film takes a more or less conventional approach to its subject matter,  starting in 1948 when Charles (then known as Raymond Charles Robinson) headed out on his own to play in seedy, all-black nightclubs, and ending in 1979, on the day when the state of Georgia officially rescinded its ban on Charles and adopted ""Georgia on My Mind"" as its official state song.  Interspersed along the way are frequent flashbacks to Charles' childhood growing up poor and fatherless in rural Florida under the guiding hand of his hardworking, demanding and tough-as-nails mother, who, even after the tragic drowning of her youngest son and Ray's onset of blindness at age seven, never gave up instilling the basic values of perseverance and self-reliance into the young boy (what a contrast to Howard Hughes` mother in ""The Aviator,"" who taught her child to basically fear everything life could possible throw at him!).  Armed with this sense of independence and determination, which helped him to out-maneuver those who would exploit him, Charles eventually made his way to the top, even though, as is often the case with artists and performers, his personal life was often at odds with his success.  The film shows us the good along with the bad, not shying away from the womanizing and heroin addiction that often threatened to derail both his career and his marriage.  Writer James L White and director Taylor Hackford have a fine eye and ear for the period in which the film is set, as we see Charles struggling for recognition in a race-sensitive society, finally achieving crossover success in the 1960's, and even becoming the first major performer to defy Jim Crow laws in the segregated South.In his superb, Oscar-winning performance, Jamie Foxx literally inhabits the role of Charles, capturing each of the singer's trademark movements and inflections with utmost accuracy and precision.  Yet his is no slavish re-creation of a well-known figure, but rather a full-bodied portrait of a flesh-and-blood human being whose genius and talent often took a back seat to his misdirected obsessions and passions.  The filmmakers have wisely opted to use Charles' own recordings rather than having either Foxx or someone else re-record them.  The entire cast is excellent, but special kudos go to Kerry Washington, Regina King and Sharon Warren as the three key women in Charles' life.Old-fashioned in the very best sense, ""Ray,"" which was released in the same year that Ray Charles himself passed away, serves as a fitting tribute to a man whose life and talent inspired generations of music lovers past and present.",4,A top film of 2004,1128038400,"09 30, 2005",2005,3074,"['****1/2One', 'top', 'films', '2004', 'Ray', 'stellar', 'biopic', 'life', 'career', 'one', 'certified', 'musical', 'legends', 'twentieth', 'century', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'battled', 'bigotry', 'blindness', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'find', 'fame', 'fortune', 'place', 'history', 'books', 'one', 'world', 's', 'premier', 'entertainers', 'leaving', 'legacy', 'great', 'music', 'powerful', 'today', 'was', 'when', 'originally', 'recorded', 'it.Structurally', 'film', 'more', 'less', 'conventional', 'approach', 'subject', 'matter', 'starting', '1948', 'when', 'Charles', 'then', 'known', 'Raymond', 'Charles', 'Robinson', 'headed', 'out', 'own', 'play', 'seedy', 'all-black', 'nightclubs', 'ending', '1979', 'day', 'when', 'state', 'Georgia', 'officially', 'rescinded', 'ban', 'Charles', 'adopted', 'Georgia', 'My', 'Mind', 'official', 'state', 'song', 'Interspersed', 'way', 'are', 'frequent', 'flashbacks', 'Charles', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'fatherless', 'rural', 'Florida', 'guiding', 'hand', 'hardworking', 'demanding', 'tough-as-nails', 'mother', 'who', 'even', 'tragic', 'drowning', 'youngest', 'son', 'Ray', 'onset', 'blindness', 'age', 'seven', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'instilling', 'basic', 'values', 'perseverance', 'self-reliance', 'young', 'boy', 'what', 'contrast', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'mother', 'Aviator', 'who', 'taught', 'child', 'basically', 'fear', 'everything', 'life', 'could', 'possible', 'throw', 'Armed', 'sense', 'independence', 'determination', 'helped', 'out-maneuver', 'who', 'would', 'exploit', 'Charles', 'eventually', 'made', 'way', 'top', 'even', 'though', 'often', 'case', 'artists', 'performers', 'personal', 'life', 'was', 'often', 'odds', 'success', 'film', 'good', 'along', 'bad', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'womanizing', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'often', 'threatened', 'derail', 'career', 'marriage', 'Writer', 'James', 'L', 'White', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'have', 'fine', 'eye', 'ear', 'period', 'film', 'set', 'see', 'Charles', 'struggling', 'recognition', 'race-sensitive', 'society', 'finally', 'achieving', 'crossover', 'success', '1960', 'even', 'becoming', 'first', 'major', 'performer', 'defy', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'laws', 'segregated', 'South.In', 'superb', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'literally', 'role', 'Charles', 'capturing', 'singer', 'trademark', 'movements', 'inflections', 'utmost', 'accuracy', 'precision', 'slavish', 're-creation', 'well-known', 'figure', 'rather', 'full-bodied', 'portrait', 'flesh-and-blood', 'human', 'being', 'genius', 'talent', 'often', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'misdirected', 'obsessions', 'passions', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'wisely', 'opted', 'use', 'Charles', 'own', 'recordings', 'rather', 'having', 'Foxx', 'someone', 'else', 're-record', 'entire', 'cast', 'excellent', 'special', 'kudos', 'go', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Regina', 'King', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'three', 'key', 'women', 'Charles', 'life.Old-fashioned', 'very', 'best', 'sense', 'Ray', 'was', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'passed', 'away', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'man', 'life', 'talent', 'inspired', 'generations', 'music', 'lovers', 'past', 'present']",Ray

Number one was when Ray (as a child) is newly blind and learning how to cope. He runs into his home and trips on a chair, hurting his toe. He cries out for his mother and she instinctively reaches out for him but thinks the better of it.This wonderful young female actress shows, in body language and facial expression alone, the full range of emotion and pain and angst a mother would feel in similar circumstances. She forces herself to simply leave the young child to his own devices during this moment of extreme pain and need; to let him learn how to comfort himself.She grapples with every maternal cell in her body to not run toward the child and scoop him up in her arms and kiss away the hurt. She loved him enough to force him to become independent. To me, that's the pivotal point in this story. Ray's life was hard but he was richly blessed with a mother whose wisdom and sagacity far exceeded her youthful age.Okay Californians - the really, really cool trivia and my second favorite scene: When Ray is escorting his new girlfriend home, they're walking along a tree-lined street in California. The street is filled with 1920s bungalows. At 49 minutes and 49 seconds into the DVD (49:49), they walk past a little white house with a centered front porch and three windows on either side of that front porch. That house is a kit home from Pacific Ready Cut Homes of Los Angeles, a company that (like Sears) sold entire kit homes through mail order.Neat, huh?Great movie. I recommend it.

Oliver,"[1, 3]","Well, after not being entertained by usual Jamie Foxx comedies, and not being inspired much by Will Smith's performance in Ali, I didn't have much expectations for this.  But after seeing collateral, I thought, hey maybe Jamie Foxx can pull it off.Ray Charles(Jamie Foxx) is undeniebly one of the greatest music legonds of all time.  He started off small time, then a man he considered like a brother to him Jeff Brown(Clifton Powell) helped him to try to get him a national superstar.  But even with his girlfriend who eventually became his wife, Della Bea, Robinson(Kerry Washington), and his newfound success, he couldn't escape his painful past, where he got more than blind. So he needed something to try to take the pain away.  Then one of his friends Fathead Newman(Bokeem Woodbine) gave him some evil in the needle.  What would become of a rising star that had a painful past, and alot of comming afflictions?This movie does a excellent job of telling Ray Charles life throughout, all he went through, the life problems, the critisism, the past, and, of course, his music.  This movie served the genres of drama, thriller, and biography with a fully loaded punch.  I mean, after watching the film, I couldn't even remember if Jamie Foxx ever did comedy before.  And the supporting cast really added a backup punch as well.  The only funny part was where the girl in the studio told Ray""you wouldn't save me if my @$$ was on fire.""  And he said ""d@mn right I wouldn't.Ray is unbalivable in a variety of ways, and shows how a blind man in a cold world gave the finger to all the odds, and rose to the heights of greatness. Jamie Foxx definitly deserved the award.  He proved he could do a role like this, and to me, he did a better job than Will Smith in Ali, Denzel Washington in Malcom X, and Samuel L. Jackson in Caoch Narter.  If Ray Charles, God rest his soul, could see this, I'm sure he'd be very proud to see his life reinacted in souch a spectacular way.

The honors are deserved.But Foxx inhabits the late soul singer instead of interpreting him, making for scenes that approach documentary. But the performance sets a slightly distant emotional tone that renders every flourish from director Taylor Hackford as contrived or sentimental.Some of them are - a drug rehabilitation sequence, for example, is faux art crap - but some of them probably wouldn't be if Foxx had approached the role with more humor. Though it touches on his flaws - heroin addiction, adultery - ""Ray"" so reveres the man and his struggle that the movie is less a celebratory trip than a two-and-a-half-hour life lesson.It's kind of edifying. It's kind of a bore.We watch Foxx bounce from gig to gig, town to town, signing to old recordings of Charles (they sound good but, again, distant, as if heard through a radio filter), getting hooked to smack, collecting mistresses, recalling with horror the death of his younger brother when Ray was boy himself. Kerry Washington and Ragina King play the two most prominent women in Ray's life, wife Della and mistress Margie Hendricks - the homemaker and the artist. One survives the turmoil of Ray's life and the other commits suicide; that juxtaposition alone allows one to see the duality of Ray Charles. The movie sees it, too, in a sobering kind of way, without the joy that accompanied many of Ray's best musical work.",3,More documentary than drama.,1112313600,"04 1, 2005",2005,1519,"['Ray', 'decent', 'prestige', 'picture', 'piece', 'excellent', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'mimicry', 'center', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'honors', 'are', 'deserved.But', 'Foxx', 'late', 'soul', 'singer', 'instead', 'interpreting', 'making', 'scenes', 'approach', 'documentary', 'performance', 'slightly', 'distant', 'emotional', 'tone', 'flourish', 'director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'contrived', 'sentimental.Some', 'are', 'drug', 'rehabilitation', 'sequence', 'example', 'faux', 'art', 'crap', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'Foxx', 'had', 'approached', 'role', 'more', 'humor', 'flaws', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'adultery', 'Ray', 'so', 'man', 'struggle', 'movie', 'less', 'celebratory', 'trip', 'two-and-a-half-hour', 'life', 'lesson.It', 'kind', 'edifying', 'kind', 'bore.We', 'watch', 'Foxx', 'bounce', 'gig', 'gig', 'town', 'town', 'signing', 'old', 'recordings', 'Charles', 'sound', 'good', 'again', 'distant', 'heard', 'radio', 'filter', 'getting', 'hooked', 'smack', 'collecting', 'mistresses', 'recalling', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'when', 'Ray', 'was', 'boy', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'Ragina', 'King', 'play', 'two', 'most', 'prominent', 'women', 'Ray', 'life', 'wife', 'Della', 'mistress', 'Margie', 'Hendricks', 'homemaker', 'artist', 'One', 'turmoil', 'Ray', 'life', 'other', 'commits', 'suicide', 'juxtaposition', 'alone', 'one', 'see', 'duality', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'movie', 'too', 'sobering', 'kind', 'way', 'joy', 'accompanied', 'many', 'Ray', 'best', 'musical', 'work']",Ray

629509,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B00005JND5,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 4]","Taylor Hackford's ""Ray"" is one of the best musical biopics, and its core strength comes not from its appreciation of Ray Charles' music or from its command of Ray's life and times (which are definitive strengths, but are common in biopics).  Rather, the key strength of ""Ray"" is its willingness to show the gigantic flaws that haunted the beloved musical genius.""Ray"" could have easily been a straight rags-to-riches story, where a young boy overcomes racial prejudice, abject poverty, and a little thing called blindness to become one of the world's most famous musicians.  After all, who doesn't love Ray Charles?  The man with the winning smile, irreverent soul, and the talent to make a Diet Pepsi jingle into a hit song could have easily been the subject of a sugary-sweet, sycophantic film.""Ray"" is not one of those.  While Ray Robinson was born into poverty and grew into the role of Ray Charles, musical deity, he did so in spite of what can only be described as colossal selfishness.  ""Ray"" gives us the man who could be a beloved family man and husband when at home, but could be a womanizing heroin addict when ""on the road.""  It's refreshing to see a movie take such an unvarnished stance towards its hero.Most revealing is Ray's first exposure to heroin.  Ray is still a bit player in a two-bit band, his blindness is being exploited (folks are stealing his money by falsely telling him the contract terms), and his bandmates refuse to let him tag along with the ladies because they don't want a blind man to cramp their style.  Nevertheless, Ray barges into a bathroom while his mates are shooting up and out of the blue demands, ""a taste.""This love of heroin follows Ray for several years.  Ray cranks out hit after hit while on the stuff, and the movie really doesn't show Ray suffering from the drug (other than some nervous scratching and a painful stint in rehab).  Still, through Ray's wife we hear about the painful toll the drug is taking on his life, and the movie's treatment of the heroin is probably sufficient.Another strong point of ""Ray"" is its willingness to show how revolutionary Ray truly was.  Virtually any movie set in the 50s and 60s will have a gratuitous scene of uptight white adults being offended by the ""new music"" - it's like shooting fish in a barrel, and is quite tired.  While ""Ray"" indeed has some of those scenes, ""Ray"" also reminds us that many in the black community were horrified at Ray's music because he had the gall to tweak gospel music into something ""dangerous.""  And that was the Devil's work.  This balance is refreshing.Any fan of Ray Charles' music will be pleased with the selections from the soundtrack.  While anyone could surely come up with some personal favorites that weren't part of the movie, the high points are definitely met.  ""Ray"" brings to light one of the lesser known aspects of Ray Charles' career - he made a country music album while at the height of his career, risked career suicide to do it, and pulled off one of the best country albums ever made.  Truly, this man was a genius (although my favorite scene showing Ray's virtuosity is the scene where he apparently improvs his way into ""Baby It's Alright"").Much has been made of Jamie Foxx's performance in the title role.  He won the Oscar, and deservedly so.  In fact, his performance in ""Ray"" is so solid that his other Oscar-nominated performance of the year, as the cab driver in ""Collateral,"" is easily overshadowed.  He won for the right performance.""Ray"" is a must-see movie for fans of American music.

629510,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00005JND5,Sebastian Fernandez,"[0, 0]","This movie will be remembered for a long time due to two factors. The first one is bringing the music by Ray Charles to the attention of the newer generations, allowing the genre to resurface in its popularity. The second is the outstanding performance of Jamie Foxx, who demonstrates that when you do something from your heart, things usually turn out right. And this is basically what this movie is about, a story that shows us the good and bad moments of one of the most renowned figures in music history, and how he had to follow his heart to liberate himself from the unforgiving clutch of drugs.The director Taylor Hackford was lucky to wait fifteen years for the right actor to come along, but he also shows that he played an important role in the success of this movie. For example, the way in which he presents the different events in the life of Ray - jumping back and forth in time instead of using a linear sequence - helps the viewer understand better the motivations behind most of the artist's actions. Events like losing his brother, losing his sight, being preyed upon by others due to his blindness and meeting people that introduced him to the drug world affected how Ray Charles lived his life. Those that see him as a flawless man will have a tough time watching some of the scenes in this film. But if you understand that he was not perfect, but someone who learned to overcome adversity, you will likely be pleased with the final result.Those that love the music of Ray Charles are in heaven with this movie, since it has a myriad of music segments (more than ninety), and one of the most amazing facts is that Foxx plays the piano himself in all of them! This is one of the factors that make his performance something special, but it is not the only one. The actor played the role blind; instead of wearing dark glasses and watching what he was doing, his eyes were shut together with silicone all through the day. I think this helped a lot in achieving a more believable performance, and his ability to imitate the way in which others talk helped a lot too.

Ray is a stunning visual spectrum of the life of Ray Charles, the architect of soul. Impossible to take one brilliant man's life and squeeze it into a two and a half hour cinematic spectacle, director Taylor Hackford did an amazing job with what he could conjure into our hearts and minds. Hackford's directing is superb. But beyond even that, one name continues to reasonate in the psyche: Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx becomes Ray Charles. This is no imitation. Foxx gets beneath Ray's skin and sinks inside a complicated, unpredictable but beautiful man and makes us feel Ray's joys, pains, angels, and demons. But his is not the only honorable performance in the movie, this movie wouldn't be half of what it is without the powerhouse performance of newcomer Sharon Warren as Ray's mother. The same way she haunts Ray's subconscious, she haunts the audience with her emotional and tough-as-nails portrayal of a poor black woman raising her two boys. Regina King is a fireball as the soulful Margie Hendrix, Ray's long-time mistress and Kerry Washington is remarkable as Ray's incredibly loyal wife. Outstanding performances make this movie so truly captivating. It may sound cliche, but it is a movie that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. You can't help but feel connected to the life of Ray Charles. He is a great historical figure who provided a soundtrack to the black experience by taking gospel and rhythm and blues and creating soul music, which expressed the existential love and pain of the black experience and it was revolutionary at that time and still revolutionary when you think about it today.

Foxx's performance in the title role is moving, funny, vibrant, alive....obviously an effort (in collaboration w/ Taylor Hackford) to capture all of the man, not just the brilliant musician. RAY covers Charles' childhood through the '60s, when he finally came to grips with a debilitating drug addiction.There's music aplenty in RAY, filmed with energy and performed with spirit by the large cast. Charles' first hit, we learn, was written by legendary Atlantic Records honcho Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) , and ""What'd I Say"" was composed on the fly onstage. My one complaint about the film was that Charles' vocals, which Foxx mimes expertly, give some of the music scenes a sepia-toned quality which undercuts the joy in the rest of the filmmaking.Still, this is a minor quibble. There's a great deal of information about Charles' business practices, owning his own masters, refusing to play segregated shows, etc., which will come as a surprise to many people.

629519,AHZFJ1Z2A3FKQ,B00005JND5,"Spare-Time Critic ""Deb""","[18, 23]","Jamie Foxx does an excellent impersonation of Ray Charles, but that's only good for about 20 minutes worth of entertainment. The movie goes on long after the novelty wears off, retelling events sequentially with the occasional childhood flashback. Who would've thought a musical legend's life could be so boring? Well, ok, I guess you wouldn't call philandering and drug addiction boring, but watching it repeatedly is another story. Occasionally a caption pops up telling you what year it is (and you really do feel it's been a year since the last one). Then it ends abruptly, almost as if someone said, ""Whoo-boy, this sure getting long. We'd better just stop here.""As for the story, Ray Charles is not portrayed in a very sympathetic light. Early on he says, ""Don't feel sorry for me because I'm blind."" Not only did I not feel sorry for him, I actually started to like him less because of his callous behavior toward others. He eventually does defeat his demons, but then what? Then the movie's over, that's what.Instead of a quick blurb about the final four decades of his life, maybe we could've been shown how he matured during that time. Did he regret having treated those close to him so shabbily? Did he do anything to make amends, where possible? Was he able to mend his relationships with his wife and kids? Too many questions were left hanging--and those were the things that might have helped me to understand him better as a person. I guess a lot could be inferred from the ending, but then so could most of the repetition of his seamier activities, which were dwelled upon so heavily. I found the whole thing overrated and disappointing.By the way, the extended version with added scenes was very poorly done. There was no effort whatsoever to be selective or to blend the addional footage in seamlesslely--it was disruptive to the movie's flow, adding to the overall feeling of disjointedness. At one point there are actually four different ""takes"" of a brief scene, one after the other; it was disturbing and almost comical.

629521,A3DY46ZABF4CMQ,B00005JND5,"S. Sarhan ""matured reviewer""","[1, 13]","I saw this movie when it was first released back in September, and something gave me the feeling that this was the year that the critics and hollywood were going to blow up Jamie Foxx out of proportion. Well, they did and now Foxx has won the Golden Globe award for best actor in a musical/comedy for his performance as the late musician Ray Charles.First of all, if you are not a fan of Charles or simply do not know who he is or was, then I presume that this film is not for you. The movie was made for Ray's fans in particular and those who appreciated his music. In modern terms for the younger generation, Ray is a long version of a Behind The Music episode on VH1, but instead of interviews, we get dramatic re-enactments of the events surrounding Charles' life from his younger years, how he became blind, rose to fame, and destroyed himself with a heroin addiction. The film successfully details these events, and does it with an eager enthusiasm. The major drive behind of the movie, however, and the true highlight of the entire story is the music. Remember, this is a movie about Ray Charles, the man who sang such classics as You Don't Know Me, Hit The Road Jack, Georgia On My Mind, and Unchain My Heart; all these songs appear in the movie.Finally, there's the acting. To be honest, I didn't get the whole Jamie Foxx buzz (he was in Held Up for crying out loud, one of the worst films ever made). It will take Foxx the next couple of films to really prove himself, which in my opinion he won't be able to due to the fact that he really isn't the best thing I have seen on the big screen in a long time. I mean he doesn't come close to Denzel Wasington or Will Smith (who's been making some really dumb movies recently) I can't deny, however, that Foxx does an excellent impression of Ray Charles, but I don't think impressions are worthy of any best acting awards, unless of course if the actor added his own into it. If Foxx is getting all this praise, then I guess Jim Carrey should have won about 3 Oscars already, and Dave Coulier should make a comeback very soon!Average***1/2 out of *****C+",3,"Hit the road, Foxx, and don't you come back no more",1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2110,"['saw', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'back', 'September', 'something', 'gave', 'feeling', 'was', 'year', 'critics', 'hollywood', 'were', 'going', 'blow', 'up', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'proportion', 'Well', 'did', 'now', 'Foxx', 'won', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'musical/comedy', 'performance', 'late', 'musician', 'Ray', 'Charles.First', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'Charles', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'then', 'presume', 'film', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Ray', 'fans', 'particular', 'who', 'appreciated', 'music', 'modern', 'terms', 'younger', 'generation', 'Ray', 'long', 'version', 'Behind', 'Music', 'episode', 'VH1', 'instead', 'interviews', 'get', 'dramatic', 're-enactments', 'events', 'surrounding', 'Charles', 'life', 'younger', 'years', 'how', 'became', 'blind', 'rose', 'fame', 'destroyed', 'heroin', 'addiction', 'film', 'successfully', 'details', 'events', 'eager', 'enthusiasm', 'major', 'drive', 'movie', 'however', 'true', 'highlight', 'entire', 'story', 'music', 'Remember', 'movie', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'man', 'who', 'sang', 'such', 'classics', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'Me', 'Hit', 'Road', 'Jack', 'Georgia', 'My', 'Mind', 'Unchain', 'My', 'Heart', 'songs', 'appear', 'movie.Finally', 'acting', 'be', 'honest', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'buzz', 'was', 'Held', 'Up', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'will', 'take', 'Foxx', 'next', 'couple', 'films', 'really', 'prove', 'opinion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'due', 'fact', 'really', ""n't"", 'best', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'big', 'screen', 'long', 'time', 'mean', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'Denzel', 'Wasington', 'Will', 'Smith', 'who', 'been', 'making', 'really', 'dumb', 'movies', 'recently', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'however', 'Foxx', 'excellent', 'impression', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'impressions', 'are', 'worthy', 'best', 'acting', 'awards', 'course', 'actor', 'added', 'own', 'Foxx', 'getting', 'praise', 'then', 'guess', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'should', 'have', 'won', '3', 'Oscars', 'already', 'Dave', 'Coulier', 'should', 'make', 'comeback', 'very', 'soon', 'Average***1/2', '*****C+']",Ray

Although there were many glowing reviews for Jamie Foxx, deservingly by the way, across the board...many reviewers had less than flattering remarks for the filmmakers and the length of the movie.  I've seen the movie twice now and I have made mental ""ignore his/her future reviews"" notes about those ""critics"" who had less than stellar opinions for the film, because they obviously don't know what they are talking about.  And the Academy apparently agrees with me.  This film is exceptional, people...exceptional.  First of all, the film is cinematically breathtaking and well-photographed and it should have been nominated for cinematography.  The acting is nothing short of superb, with Jamie Foxx worthy of every ounce of the Oscar-winning performance he garnered.  Sure, the movie is long but you shouldn't notice as the story is well-crafted and unsparingly honest and unbiased in its protrayal of the imperfect title character.  And despite his drug use and abhorrent womanizing, Ray Charles' genius and humanity is apparent and well-depicted.  His musical icon status is not soiled upon and for me, I actually gained a greater appreciation for his contributions and his opening the door for all those that followed in his footsteps.

629530,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B00005JND5,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[1, 1]","Jamie Foxx initially broke into the business as a comedian, but he really wanted to be a singer. In ""Ray"", he gets his wish. After a stint on the shows ""In Living Color"" and ""Roc"", his own TV sitcom and appearances in several film comedies (some good, others not so good), we got to see what he was really made of. He began to be cast in dramatic roles in big-budget films like ""Any Given Sunday"", where he played an egotistical football star to the hilt. Later on we caught Foxx as Bundini Brown in ""Ali"", and he gave yet another noticeable, showstopping performance in that role. Then came his role last year in ""Collateral"" with Tom Cruise, and we just knew it: Jamie Foxx could definitely be taken seriously as an actor. He had landed the part of the late R&B; pioneer and legend Ray Charles, but there were some doubters out there as to if Jamie was the right person for the role...his past in comedy came back to haunt him. But he proves the nay-sayers wrong with his amazing and unforgettable performance in this movie.Jamie, in his role as Charles, is remarkably like Brother Ray with his mannerisms, as if he had channeled the beloved legend's spirit and brought it to life on screen. The film chronicles Ray's rise to fame, with flashbacks of his childhood, the drowning death of his little brother and how he gradually lost his vision during those years. But it doesn't shy away from his dark side, nor does it paint him as a saint, either: his growing addiction to heroin and his shabby treatment of the people closest to him (his wife, mistresses, producers and management) are a big part of this movie. It does sugarcoat and embellish some things about Ray's life in the script, but that does not take away from the fact that Taylor Hackford's direction of Jamie and this film is simply a joy to watch, and is no doubt Oscar-worthy. The supporting cast is also very strong...newcomer Sharon Warren as Ray's mom Aretha, Kerry Washington as Della Bee, Ray's wife, and veteran actress Regina King as Margie are only a few of many powerful performances to take note of.The DVD is packed with a lot of bonus features that are also thoroughly enjoyable: numerous deleted scenes (which you have the option of seeing individually or when viewing the film in its entirety - I don't recommend it, though - the editing is poor), extended musical performances and interviews with Ray's friends and admirers, and footage of Ray and Jamie together.Before his death in June, 2004, Ray gave Jamie his personal seal of approval to portray him in the film, and that seemed to be the motivation that Jamie used to completely envelop himself in the role. If he's good enough for Ray, then he's good enough for me. Job well done, Mr. Foxx.

Jamie Fox plays Ray and does a great job showing the emotion of how one man went for everything he wanted, managed to get it, but almost lost it when drugs and the need for women entered his life. This is one movie that needs to be seen for someone who wan'ts some inspiration of their own.Ray Charles was born in a poor African American neighborhood in Florida. After going blind at a very young age, it seemed like he would not accomplish anything at all. But with the help of his strong supporting mother, Ray went on to challenge racism in the music world, became a smash hit, and almost went overboard after realizing that women and drugs offered a lot more excitement than the top of the music world.Some people compared this to Jonny Cash's movie, Walk the Line. I think both are extremely well done movies, and this is one movie that needs to be seen in order to fully understand what one man had to go through to reach his goals in life.Extras include:Commentary by Director Taylor Hackford14 deleted scenes""Ray Remembered"" [A look at the real Ray Charles]9 additional music performances""The Women of Ray""And a small booklet showing the life of Ray CharlesThis is one DVD you need to see.Highly Recommended",4,One movie that will surely make you admire Ray Charles...,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",2006,1388,"['Ray', 'story', 'legendary', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'blind', 'age', '7', 'still', 'managed', 'become', 'greatest', 'music', 'icons', 'jazz', 'others', 'world', 'Jamie', 'Fox', 'Ray', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'emotion', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'went', 'everything', 'wanted', 'managed', 'get', 'almost', 'lost', 'when', 'drugs', 'need', 'women', 'entered', 'life', 'one', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'someone', 'who', ""wan'ts"", 'inspiration', 'own.Ray', 'Charles', 'was', 'born', 'poor', 'African', 'American', 'neighborhood', 'Florida', 'going', 'blind', 'very', 'young', 'age', 'seemed', 'would', 'not', 'accomplish', 'anything', 'help', 'strong', 'supporting', 'mother', 'Ray', 'went', 'challenge', 'racism', 'music', 'world', 'became', 'smash', 'hit', 'almost', 'went', 'overboard', 'realizing', 'women', 'drugs', 'offered', 'lot', 'more', 'excitement', 'top', 'music', 'world.Some', 'people', 'compared', 'Jonny', 'Cash', 'movie', 'Walk', 'Line', 'think', 'are', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'movies', 'one', 'movie', 'be', 'seen', 'order', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'one', 'man', 'had', 'go', 'reach', 'goals', 'life.Extras', 'include', 'Commentary', 'Director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford14', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Ray', 'Remembered', 'look', 'real', 'Ray', 'Charles', '9', 'additional', 'music', 'performances', 'Women', 'Ray', 'small', 'booklet', 'showing', 'life', 'Ray', 'CharlesThis', 'one', 'DVD', 'need', 'see.Highly', 'Recommended']",Ray

However , an actor is only as good as the actors that surround him or her. Therefore , I take my hat off , to the entire cast. From Terrence Howard to Regina King ( who gives a searing performance as Charles's estranged mistress )everyone seemed to give their charactors a heartbeat and a presence, that moves the entire rhythm of the film. The editing is rather choppy , but the directing is top knotch. As for the film , it's a biopic , that starts with Charles's escape from a blind school , and his pilgrimage to find stardom. It's such an amazing story, that it's hard to imagine, anyone getting through Charles's turmoils and challenges , during that period of time. Especially , if you're blind. However , the great thing about this film is that it doesn't try to to make us believe that Ray Charles was a saint. "" Ray "", cleverly, seperates the musical genius from the problems and addictions that plagued him , for most of his life.  I think the director did an excellent job of "" keeping it real "". By showing us that Ray's life wasn't perfect and neither were some of the decisions that he made , allowed us to see how resiliant, he really was. However , there is one dream sequence scene , in which Ray, has an oppurtunity to rectify things, in his past, that's kinda far-fetched. I assume it's for purely dramatic reasons , to accentuate a change , in his life. But once again , Jamie Foxx's riveting performance overshadows , that scene.

629541,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JND5,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 1]","Jamie Foxx is Ray Charles.  That's what you would feel after watching Taylor Hackford's bio-pic of late Ray Charles.  Not only Foxx moves like Ray, with his characteristic, jerky body movements, but he represents the soul of the great musician himself.Despite the long running time (more than 150 minutes), the film never shows lull, covering the life of Ray Charles from his childhood to the stardom.  Despite the too familiar ways of showing the psychological aspects of his life, the film is skillfully edited, and shows his genius as musician and strong will for success, both of which are no surprising matters.  Made with the artist's own  saction, the film is fairly honest about the negative sides of his personality -- about use of substance, womanizing habits, and dubious judgements influenced by money.  But they are also part of Ray.[MUSIC] But the film's greatest strength lies in the interpretation of Ray Charles' music, or how his style came to be what it is.  It is easy for anyone to portray him as genius, but the director knows rightly that his talent lies in innovation -- fusing gospel music with rhythmn and blues.  And 'Ray' presents us the innovator's way of thinking, or inspiration, by cleverly putting his classic songs in the context of his own history.  How and where did he think of 'I Got a Woman'?  How did people (including his future wife) respond to it?  The music history is never so accurately and succinctly interpreted as in 'Ray.'For all the hit songs like 'Georgia on My Mind' or 'I Can't Stop Loving You,' the film suggests that the culmination of Ray Charles's career is 'What'd I Say.'  The whole film is great, of course, but that scene showing the birth of that song (my favorite) alone deserves 5 star rating.  At that moment, the music gets irresistible.  From there, the film's latter half is slightly weak, for after all, Ray Charles sitting behind the executive's desk is much less attractive Ray Charles singing in a travelling band.But all the actors, especially Jamie Foxx and Sharon Warren as Ray's mother are so memorable that you won't just stop watching it.  My only complaint is that Taylor Hackford should not have let Foxx take off the glasses at one scene -- you will know where -- in which he looks like not Ray, but Jamie Foxx, for he revels his own eyes.  You know, Foxx has eyes that remind us of puppy, and in that scene only he stops being Ray.But for all its small flaws, 'Ray' will remain in your mind as a great tribute to Ray Charles and his music.

629543,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00005JND5,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[3, 7]","Most films in the biopic genre follow the same conventional formula: modest beginnings and/or scarring experience, growing popularity, ultimate success, ultimate downfall, personal and public redemption, then a little piece about how the subject affected his or her society.  In a year full of biopics about influential men --Howard Hughes, Cole Porter, Alfred Kinsey, Bobby Darin, and, here, Ray Charles-- one would hope at least one or two of these films would transcend the genre and stand as one of 2004's better films.  'Ray' does not do so and disappoints in its formulaic, dull portrayal of a man whose music was famed for being consistently groundbreaking, moving, and inspiring.Though Ray Charles' life may be able to be captured within such a basic formula as previously mentioned, there are so many details of Charles' personal arc we do not see crystallized.  'Ray,' a lengthy film, moves along at a quick, choppy pace, shifting focus from event to event.  What we see is a montage of performances and recording sessions cataloging Charles' musical history.  But under the direction of Taylor Hackford ('Devil's Advocate'), this desultory recollection of instances where American history and performance interweave actually weaken the film: the musical sequences are often so enthralling we disregard the boring calm of 'Ray's thin emotional tale (further weakened by a failed, uninteresting attempt to connect Ray's drug addiction with the death of his younger brother, which results in an overly-melodramatic, cliched ending).What is seen in between is your basic sob story of a man who loses himself in drugs and adultery while the ""long-suffering wife"" (Kerry Washington, doing well with what she's given) waits at home alone with children, watching the man she loves transform into a burden.  Of course, she stays home as it grows larger and larger as her husband's career does the same.  Of course, she feels lonely.  And of course, she stands by him.  The problem is that any emotional foundation found in the dumbed-down valleys wears thin because of its familiarity: it is not allowed to move beyond the basic troubled musician story, and in turn fails to elicit concrete feeling.  Luckily, 'Ray' is full of strong performances to keep its audience awake during the trouble spots.Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles gives the film's strongest performance.  His acting is kinetic, moving with a force that both captures the real-life Charles' spirit and easily identifiable mannerisms while also exploring the inner being of the man and his struggles with being blind, an adulterer, and a heroin addict.  Sometimes, his performance is borderline impersonation, but maintains enough control to never fully cross the line into dangerously bland territory.  Regina King as Charles' most frequent on-the-road mistress, Margie (one of the Raelettes), also gives a stand-out performance that manages to be at once dimensional and enthralling.Perhaps 'Ray's most underrated performance is Sharon Warren's as Ray's mother, Aretha Robinson.  Her character is forced to come to terms with one of her sons' death and another's worsening blindness.  Warren maintains a strength and wisdom that grows endearingly realistic.  She should be considered for an Oscar nomination, but probably will not have the chance she deserves considering her lack of name recognition and screen-time.Collectively, these performances, in addition to strikingly visceral music and a creative flash-back sequence, redeem the film from being complete dreck.  While the film unevenly refers back to Charles' era and growing popularity, Hackford refrains from fully penetrating the psyche of Charles as a human being, and we never fully understand what drives him to create as passionately as he does.  However, though I found most of the film to be uninvolving (I nearly fell asleep three or four times), some fans of Ray Charles and his music will love 'Ray' no matter the flaws, as it does cram (awkwardly, mind you) most of his life into the running time; perhaps that is an act of appreciation.  I believe it is an unwise decision that plagues the modern biopic, hindering any chance at breaking convention and exciting the masses the way the men and women the genre focuses on did in their time, discovering, creating, and uplifting; 'Ray' does none of those things and left me curiously unsatisfied.",3,"A choppy, uninspired, standard biopic.",1099612800,"11 5, 2004",2004,4380,"['Most', 'films', 'biopic', 'genre', 'follow', 'same', 'conventional', 'formula', 'modest', 'beginnings', 'scarring', 'experience', 'growing', 'popularity', 'ultimate', 'success', 'ultimate', 'downfall', 'personal', 'public', 'redemption', 'then', 'little', 'piece', 'how', 'subject', 'affected', 'society', 'year', 'full', 'biopics', 'influential', 'men', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'Cole', 'Porter', 'Alfred', 'Kinsey', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'here', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'would', 'transcend', 'genre', 'stand', 'one', '2004', 'better', 'films', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'disappoints', 'formulaic', 'dull', 'portrayal', 'man', 'music', 'was', 'famed', 'being', 'consistently', 'groundbreaking', 'moving', 'inspiring.Though', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'captured', 'basic', 'formula', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'details', 'Charles', 'personal', 'arc', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'crystallized', 'lengthy', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'quick', 'choppy', 'pace', 'shifting', 'focus', 'event', 'event', 'What', 'see', 'montage', 'performances', 'recording', 'sessions', 'cataloging', 'Charles', 'musical', 'history', 'direction', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'Advocate', 'desultory', 'recollection', 'instances', 'where', 'American', 'history', 'performance', 'interweave', 'actually', 'weaken', 'film', 'musical', 'sequences', 'are', 'often', 'so', 'enthralling', 'disregard', 'boring', 'calm', ""'Ray"", 'thin', 'emotional', 'tale', 'further', 'weakened', 'failed', 'uninteresting', 'attempt', 'connect', 'Ray', 'drug', 'addiction', 'death', 'younger', 'brother', 'results', 'overly-melodramatic', 'cliched', 'ending', 'seen', 'basic', 'sob', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'drugs', 'adultery', 'long-suffering', 'wife', 'Kerry', 'Washington', 'doing', 'well', 'what', 'given', 'waits', 'home', 'alone', 'children', 'watching', 'man', 'transform', 'burden', 'course', 'home', 'larger', 'larger', 'husband', 'career', 'same', 'course', 'lonely', 'course', 'problem', 'emotional', 'foundation', 'found', 'dumbed-down', 'valleys', 'wears', 'thin', 'familiarity', 'not', 'allowed', 'move', 'basic', 'troubled', 'musician', 'story', 'turn', 'fails', 'elicit', 'concrete', 'feeling', 'Luckily', ""'Ray"", 'full', 'strong', 'performances', 'keep', 'audience', 'awake', 'trouble', 'spots.Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'film', 'strongest', 'performance', 'acting', 'kinetic', 'moving', 'force', 'real-life', 'Charles', 'spirit', 'easily', 'identifiable', 'mannerisms', 'also', 'exploring', 'inner', 'being', 'man', 'struggles', 'being', 'blind', 'adulterer', 'heroin', 'addict', 'Sometimes', 'performance', 'borderline', 'impersonation', 'enough', 'control', 'never', 'fully', 'cross', 'line', 'dangerously', 'bland', 'territory', 'Regina', 'King', 'Charles', 'most', 'frequent', 'on-the-road', 'mistress', 'Margie', 'one', 'Raelettes', 'also', 'stand-out', 'performance', 'be', 'once', 'dimensional', 'enthralling.Perhaps', ""'Ray"", 'most', 'underrated', 'performance', 'Sharon', 'Warren', 'Ray', 'mother', 'Aretha', 'Robinson', 'character', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'one', 'sons', 'death', 'worsening', 'blindness', 'Warren', 'strength', 'wisdom', 'endearingly', 'realistic', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'probably', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'chance', 'considering', 'lack', 'name', 'recognition', 'screen-time.Collectively', 'performances', 'addition', 'strikingly', 'visceral', 'music', 'creative', 'flash-back', 'sequence', 'redeem', 'film', 'being', 'complete', 'dreck', 'film', 'unevenly', 'refers', 'back', 'Charles', 'era', 'growing', 'popularity', 'Hackford', 'fully', 'penetrating', 'psyche', 'Charles', 'human', 'being', 'never', 'fully', 'understand', 'what', 'create', 'as', 'passionately', 'However', 'found', 'most', 'film', 'be', 'uninvolving', 'nearly', 'fell', 'asleep', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'fans', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'music', 'will', 'love', ""'Ray"", 'matter', 'flaws', 'cram', 'awkwardly', 'most', 'life', 'running', 'time', 'perhaps', 'act', 'appreciation', 'believe', 'unwise', 'decision', 'modern', 'biopic', 'hindering', 'chance', 'breaking', 'convention', 'exciting', 'masses', 'way', 'men', 'women', 'genre', 'did', 'time', 'discovering', 'creating', 'uplifting', 'none', 'things', 'left', 'curiously', 'unsatisfied']",Ray

The only true competition this year would have been Jeff Bridges' searing performance in The Door in the Floor or Paul Giamannti in Sideways and neither one of these actors was nominated. Foxx's performance towers above everyone else nominated this year. He channels Charles' energy, quirks, movements and personality in a performance that doesn't just mimic Charles but goes right to the heart of the man.Director Taylor Hackford's love of music infuses this film as it has just about every other one he's directed. The difference here is that Hackford truly has found a larger-than-life but very mortal artist that changed the sound of R&B; by merging it seamlessly with the emotional power of gospel, country and western and just about any other genre Charles effortlessly tackled. What makes Ray so powerful is its unflincing honesty about Charles' demons and infidelities. It also shows that, regardless of Charles' sins, his salvation always could be found in the emotional core of his music.Ray looks very good on DVD. The length of the theatrical release along with the inclusion of deleted scenes for the longer DVD release means that the image quality has been compromised just a tad. The colors are rich with remarkable detail and the solid blacks are highlights of this transfer. 25 minutes of additional footage has been added back in for the extended version. You have the option to watch either the original version or this extended version. The image quality, color and clarity vary a bit as it cuts between the theatrical version and the deleted scenes. Clearly, this wasn't recut and retimed for this ""extended"" version. The difference between the finished film and the added scenes are quite noticeable and jarring. The 5.1 soundtrack features a rich full bodied sound that immediately pulls you into the action. Charles' songs (featuring both original and new recordings) sound terrific in the 5.1 format.The inclusion of the 25 minutes of footage is a welcome addition but there are a couple of problems. Unlike Fox's superb extended branching editions of the Alien films, the disc pauses as it searches for the deleted scenes. This disrupts the continuity and flow of the movie. Personally, I would have preferred this in a 2 disc set featuring both the theatrical cut and the extended version along with extras on the flipside of one of these discs. There IS a two disc edition but it's bogged down by extras many of which are little more than padding. We also get to see the complete uncut performances of Ray & The Raelettes performing Hit the Road Jack and a number of other tracks cut for the film. Walking in His Shoes features Jamie Foxx discussing his performance of Charles and Charles himself performing with Foxx. Luckily Foxx was trained as a classical pianist so he aquits himself very well when they goof around ont he Charles chestnut ""Mess Around"". It's fun to watch and a worthwhile addition to the set. Ray Remembered features interviews with those that worked with him past and present both on his albums and those that observed him while working on the film. The differences between the single disc edition and the double disc are in the extras. The two disc edition features a number of fascinating featurettes on the women in Charles' life, the ""Soulmates"" featurette, a documentary on Taylor Hackford's love of Charles' music and difficulty in getting the project made and an exceptionally good documentary on Charles entitled ""Ray: An American Journey"". If you aren't likely to dip your toe into these feauturettes and documentaries than the extra cost for the two disc set isn't probably going to be worth it for you. There's also a booklet on Charles and the making of the film. The single disc edition of the movie is presented in the dreaded dual sided, dual layered format. Why dreaded? Because this format doesn't stand up to wear and tear as well. Universal probably should have released this two editions; a two disc set (vs. the dual layered, dual sided version) and a three disc set at affordable prices. Surely if other studios can release the two disc sets and make a profit, then Universal can as well.Taylor Hackford's incisive commentary track tackles a wide range of topics from the challenges of shooting the film, recreating the past and the wonder and awe he felt working with both Foxx and Charles. Hackford also documents where the film veers from reality and the dramatic reasons why. It's one of the few solo commentary tracks worth listening to from beginning to end.A flawed masterpiece, Ray would have been a better film if the 25 minutes of additional footage had been integrated into this DVD in a better fashion than it is. Nevertheless, Hackford's passion for music and interest in the subject along with the terrific performances from Foxx and the rest of the cast makes this an essential purchase for fans of Charles' music. Although the portrait it paints is frequently less than complimentary and unpleasant, it also allows us to understand the passion that drove this singular artist to help create a unique sound in music.",5,A glimpse into the soulful music of Charles and his soul,1107561600,"02 5, 2005",2005,5192,"['matter', 'name', 'announce', 'Oscar', 'night', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'winner',

But other than those two elements, this theatrical version of Charles's life is not much better than what could be expected of a made-for-TV biopic of a man who broke conventions and genres and helped shape modern music.""Ray"" follows the performer from his teenage beginnings through his thirties, climaxing on an important moment in Charles's life when he made a moral declaration. Like many artists, Ray Charles's youth haunted him for years. Once he became blind at seven, his mind replayed one of his last images (the death of his brother), and those constant visions drove the married Ray to dull his pain in the arms of other women and with the euphoric release gained from heroin.But with those counter-productive outlets, Charles also escaped with his music. He immersed himself in the craft, building on an unexplainable gift for throwing different musical styles together and allowing them to instantly create new, exciting sounds. Sometimes country, sometimes blues, sometimes gospel...but always brilliant.Maybe the virtuosity of his music and the strength of great acting performances is enough for a film, and if that is true, ""Ray"" works (because that's about all that is to be admired). 2004 will be the year of the biopic (Hughes, Kinsey, Alexander, Jesus, Berrie, etc), and many of these motion pictures could learn lessons from the great depictions of historical figures in past films. ""Ray"" makes the same mistake made by recent films based on Andy Kaufman, Muhammad Ali and others. These movies believe their subject matter's strength is all a film needs, ignoring the potential to use the lives of great individuals as a catapult for statements on important issues or to shed light on the human spirit (see films based on Larry Flynt, Jake LaMotta or Mozart).""Ray"" fails to become anything more than an attractive telling of the life of an American icon. The immediate critical praise for this film will diminish in years, as the current reviews have no doubt been affected by the recent passing of Charles and the undeniable love for the man and his music by many (including myself). The criticism found here for the film should not be applied to the man or his music, just the lackluster manner in which both were presented on screen.",3,Foxx is terrific in this flawed film about a great man,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",2005,2440,"['film', 'adorned', 'music', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'will', 'fill', 'audiences', 'excitement', 'awe', 'performance', 'comparable', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'depiction', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'warrants', 'viewing', 'other', 'two', 'elements', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Charles', 'life', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'made-for-TV', 'biopic', 'man', 'who', 'broke', 'conventions', 'genres', 'helped', 'shape', 'modern', 'music', 'Ray', 'performer', 'teenage', 'beginnings', 'thirties', 'climaxing', 'important', 'moment', 'Charles', 'life', 'when', 'made', 'moral', 'declaration', 'many', 'artists', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'youth', 'haunted', 'years', 'Once', 'became', 'blind', 'seven', 'mind', 'replayed', 'one', 'last', 'images', 'death', 'brother', 'constant', 'visions', 'drove', 'married', 'Ray', 'dull', 'pain', 'arms', 'other', 'women', 'euphoric', 'release', 'gained', 'heroin.But', 'counter-productive', 'outlets', 'Charles', 'also', 'escaped', 'music', 'immersed', 'craft', 'building', 'unexplainable', 'gift', 'throwing', 'different', 'musical', 'styles', 'together', 'allowing', 'instantly', 'create', 'new', 'exciting', 'sounds', 'Sometimes', 'country', 'sometimes', 'blues', 'sometimes', 'gospel', 'always', 'brilliant.Maybe', 'virtuosity', 'music', 'strength', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'enough', 'film', 'true', 'Ray', 'works', 'be', 'admired', '2004', 'will', 'be', 'year', 'biopic', 'Hughes', 'Kinsey', 'Alexander', 'Jesus', 'Berrie', 'etc', 'many', 'motion', 'pictures', 'could', 'learn', 'lessons', 'great', 'depictions', 'historical', 'figures', 'past', 'films', 'Ray', 'same', 'mistake', 'made', 'recent', 'films', 'based', 'Andy', 'Kaufman', 'Muhammad', 'Ali', 'others', 'movies', 'believe', 'subject', 'matter', 'strength', 'film', 'needs', 'ignoring', 'potential', 'use', 'lives', 'great', 'individuals', 'catapult', 'statements', 'important', 'issues', 'shed', 'light', 'human', 'spirit', 'see', 'films', 'based', 'Larry', 'Flynt', 'Jake', 'LaMotta', 'Mozart', 'Ray', 'become', 'anything', 'more', 'attractive', 'telling', 'life', 'American', 'icon', 'immediate', 'critical', 'praise', 'film', 'will', 'diminish', 'years', 'current', 'reviews', 'have', 'doubt', 'been', 'affected', 'recent', 'passing', 'Charles', 'undeniable', 'love', 'man', 'music', 'many', 'including', 'criticism', 'found', 'here', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'applied', 'man', 'music', 'just', 'lackluster', 'manner', 'were', 'presented', 'screen']",Ray

629548,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JND5,William Hare,"[2, 3]","Director Taylor Hackford parlayed a biography of one of the most uniquely talented singers of the post-World War Two era alongside a commanding performance by Jamie Foxx to propel ""Ray"" beyond the ranks of the traditional biopic into much more, a soul searching reflection of a great performer seeking to overcome the temptations of stardom and overcome an affliction that threatens to kill him.In the case of musical legend Ray Charles, the superstar that Foxx plays with total conviction and unflagging energy, temptations along with the road to stardom was all the more difficult due to the singer's blindness from youth.  One of the film's most inspiring scenes unfolds when Charles's mother, at the time he is going blind, tells him that she will be his eyes and give him instructions, but only once.  She reasons that this is the way life operates; you get one chance and after that you are on your own.  This is the philosophy she repeatedly drives home when he is confronted with impending blindness.Using extensive flashbacks, Hackford via Jimmy White's script directs us from Charles's early roots growing up poor in rural North Florida to the pivotal period when he seeks to make his mark in music.  One city where he receives an opportunity to be heard is Seattle, where he meets a young Quincy Jones and they explore the local musical world together.Another important element of the film is the exploration of how Charles fought back when those around him sought to take advantage of his blindness.  He learned through experience to question the process of counting out bills in payment for his musical services after having been taken advantage of by dishonest music promoters.Foxx's greatest challenge, which was surmounted with believability, was getting across the tortured side of Charles resulting from his addiction to drugs.  The painful process in which, by film's end, he has thrown off the monkey from his back, is handled deftly with Foxx never going over the edge or underplaying.  The sweating and trembling appear real and one can feel the pain emanating from Foxx as he transports us into the tortured world of a man under the influence of drugs.The compelling performance of Foxx as a man under the influence of drugs is reminiscent of the brilliant effort of Ray Milland as a man addicted to alcohol in the sober and hard-hitting Billy Wilder 1945 drama, ""The Lost Weekend,"" for which the British actor, like Foxx six decades later, was rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar.  The arresting performance of Foxx was reminiscent of Milland's in that, in each case, we can feel the pain of the burdened individual overcome by a potentially deadly affliction.Another area where ""Ray"" pulls no punches is in the presentation of the temptations Charles confronts when he moves into the superstar ranks.  While his loyal wife stays home and takes care of their son Charles engages in affairs with singers who perform with him, including one who has his child.Charles's vital link to the rapidly developing civil rights movement of the sixties is also dramatically presented.  One scene presents Charles at his most admirable when he refuses to cross a picket line and perform before a segregated audience.  Pressures are brought against him afterwards by furious music promoters, including the one on whom Charles walked out, but he admirably refuses to back down even when his career existence is threatened, confident that he is standing on the right side of history.""Ray"" is a film with heart and soul that, through Foxx's dominant performance, gives us a fascinating look into the life of a genuine performing genius.",5,An Oscar Richly Deserved,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,3640,"['Director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'parlayed', 'biography', 'one', 'most', 'uniquely', 'talented', 'singers', 'post-World', 'War', 'Two', 'era', 'commanding', 'performance', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'propel', 'Ray', 'ranks', 'traditional', 'biopic', 'much', 'more', 'soul', 'searching', 'reflection', 'great', 'performer', 'seeking', 'overcome', 'temptations', 'stardom', 'overcome', 'affliction', 'kill', 'case', 'musical', 'legend', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'superstar', 'Foxx', 'total', 'conviction', 'unflagging', 'energy', 'temptations', 'road', 'stardom', 'was', 'more', 'difficult', 'due', 'singer', 'blindness', 'youth', 'One', 'film', 'most', 'inspiring', 'scenes', 'unfolds', 'when', 'Charles', 'mother', 'time', 'going', 'blind', 'will', 'be', 'eyes', 'give', 'instructions', 'only', 'once', 'reasons', 'way', 'life', 'get', 'one', 'chance', 'are', 'own', 'philosophy', 'repeatedly', 'home', 'when', 'confronted', 'impending', 'blindness.Using', 'extensive', 'flashbacks', 'Hackford', 'Jimmy', 'White', 'script', 'Charles', 'early', 'roots', 'growing', 'up', 'poor', 'rural', 'North', 'Florida', 'pivotal', 'period', 'when', 'make', 'mark', 'music', 'One', 'city', 'where', 'opportunity', 'be', 'heard', 'Seattle', 'where', 'young', 'Quincy', 'Jones', 'explore', 'local', 'musical', 'world', 'together.Another', 'important', 'element', 'film', 'exploration', 'how', 'Charles', 'fought', 'back', 'when', 'sought', 'take', 'advantage', 'blindness', 'learned', 'experience', 'question', 'process', 'counting', 'out', 'bills', 'payment', 'musical', 'services', 'having', 'been', 'taken', 'advantage', 'dishonest', 'music', 'promoters.Foxx', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'was', 'surmounted', 'believability', 'was', 'getting', 'tortured', 'side', 'Charles', 'resulting', 'addiction', 'drugs', 'painful', 'process', 'film', 'end', 'thrown', 'off', 'monkey', 'back', 'handled', 'deftly', 'Foxx', 'never', 'going', 'edge', 'underplaying', 'sweating', 'trembling', 'appear', 'real', 'one', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'emanating', 'Foxx', 'tortured', 'world', 'man', 'influence', 'drugs.The', 'compelling', 'performance', 'Foxx', 'man', 'influence', 'drugs', 'reminiscent', 'brilliant', 'effort', 'Ray', 'Milland', 'man', 'addicted', 'alcohol', 'sober', 'hard-hitting', 'Billy', 'Wilder', '1945', 'drama', 'Lost', 'Weekend', 'British', 'actor', 'Foxx', 'six', 'decades', 'later', 'was', 'rewarded', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'arresting', 'performance', 'Foxx', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Milland', 'case', 'can', 'feel', 'pain', 'burdened', 'individual', 'overcome', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'affliction.Another', 'area', 'where', 'Ray', 'punches', 'presentation', 'temptations', 'Charles', 'confronts', 'when', 'superstar', 'ranks', 'loyal', 'wife', 'home', 'care', 'son', 'Charles', 'affairs', 'singers', 'who', 'perform', 'including', 'one', 'who', 'child.Charles', 'vital', 'link', 'rapidly', 'developing', 'civil', 'rights', 'movement', 'sixties', 'also', 'dramatically', 'presented', 'One', 'scene', 'Charles', 'most', 'admirable', 'when', 'cross', 'picket', 'line', 'perform', 'segregated', 'audience', 'Pressures', 'are', 'brought', 'afterwards', 'furious', 'music', 'promoters', 'including', 'one', 'whom', 'Charles', 'walked', 'out', 'admirably', 'back', 'down', 'even', 'when', 'career', 'existence', 'threatened', 'confident', 'standing', 'right', 'side', 'history', 'Ray', 'film', 'heart', 'soul', 'Foxx', 'dominant', 'performance', 'fascinating', 'look', 'life', 'genuine', 'performing', 'genius']",Ray

I had no idea that his life was so remarkably painful and inspirational. I also hesitated on seeing this movie at the cinemas, because I was not a fan of Jamie Foxx. After seeing him in this entertaining and emotionally impacting film, I trully admire his performance that is definitely the top five of the year! I don't know if the Oscar people think he's ready  for the gold or not, since it's his first nod. Even though he's very deserving to win, I have a feeling they are going to give it to Leo. My choice is either Jamie Foxx or the non-nominees including Jeff Bridges, Paul Giamatti, and Liam Neeson.This movie chronicles the life and career of Ray Charles Robinson, starting with his early days doing gigs at a small bar all the way to recording albums, and touring the country when he became increasingly successiful. It also covered his marriage, the affairs with the singers in the band and his fans. More importantly, we get to see flashbacks of his childhood when he was in Florida living in proverty with his mom and younger brother who accidently drown to death, and he felt guilty about it for many years. It was this traumatic event that propelled him to abuse cocain for many years, and it ultimately hurt his career and relationships. It took him some serious rehab time to recover from his addiction. He also learned to let go and forgive himself when his dead brother and mother came into his dreams during his recovery.We get to hear many of Ray's greatest hits throughout the film, and my favorites are Georgia On My Mind and Hit The Road Again. Ray's had a very hard life, and he's probably the most unlikely person to become a legendary musician, because of his upbringing and being a blind person since early childhood. So many obstacles and people wanted to take an advantage of his talent.

Switching gears,  ""Ray"" had a good screenplay and was directed well because without that, Jamie Foxx would have been just another cookie cut-out of a fallen rock star. Even without knowing about Ray Charles and his legacy left behind, ""Ray""  is a movie that tells his story with style and grace.  It's a movie that's informative and entertaining, and for someone like me who did not grow up listening to Ray Charles, the generation gap was not an issue.  I enjoyed the story and appreciated his music as told by Jamie Foxx.  Recommended to people who appreciate good acting, a good story and quality film making.",4,Ray Ray,1124582400,"08 21, 2005",2005,917,"['Who', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'crazy', 'drag', 'queen', 'thing', 'forgot', 'name', 'Living', 'Colour', 'would', 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actor', '..After', 'viewing', 'Ray', 'Aviator', 'personal', 'oppinion', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'tie', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Leo', 'Di', 'Caprio', 'best', 'actor', 'who', 'really', 'right', 'Switching', 'gears', 'Ray', 'had', 'good', 'screenplay', 'was', 'directed', 'well', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'cookie', 'cut-out', 'fallen', 'rock', 'star', 'Even', 'knowing', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'legacy', 'left', 'behind', 'Ray', 'movie', 'story', 'style', 'grace', 'movie', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'listening', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'generation', 'gap', 'was', 'not', 'issue', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'appreciated', 'music', 'told', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'Recommended', 'people', 'who', 'appreciate', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'story', 'quality', 'film', 'making']",Ray
