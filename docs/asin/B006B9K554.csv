It includes the untold scandal involving black-balled crewmen who were wrongly accused of cowardice, that were treated unfairly instead of as heroes under difficult circumstances. For the most part, the color footage (some from &#34;The Saga of the USS Franklin&#34;) adds to the searing, savagery of the attack. Like a good John Wayne film, the camaraderie of the crew allows the Franklin to avoid a sad demise. In one hour you will see what America's Can-Do spirit does in its darkest hour and in the process why the USS Franklin was deservedly the most decorated crew and ship in naval history.",5,Big Ben as big as America Can-Do,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,779,"['most', 'general', 'refreshed', 'account', 'former', 'crew', 'members', 'horrifying', 'last-minute', 'attack', 'Japanese', 'sink', 'USS', 'Franklin', 'late', 'war', '60', 'miles', 'Japan', 'untold', 'scandal', 'involving', 'black-balled', 'crewmen', 'who', 'were', 'wrongly', 'accused', 'cowardice', 'were', 'treated', 'unfairly', 'instead', 'heroes', 'difficult', 'circumstances', 'most', 'part', 'color', 'footage', '34', 'Saga', 'USS', 'Franklin', '34', 'searing', 'savagery', 'attack', 'good', 'John', 'Wayne', 'film', 'camaraderie', 'crew', 'Franklin', 'avoid', 'sad', 'demise', 'one', 'hour', 'will', 'see', 'what', 'America', 'Can-Do', 'spirit', 'darkest', 'hour', 'process', 'why', 'USS', 'Franklin', 'was', 'deservedly', 'most', 'decorated', 'crew', 'ship', 'naval', 'history']",USS Franklin: Honored Restored

To recognize the courage and dedication to duty of these men has been preserved in a poignant and personal way that recreates a definitive naval action.  If one chooses to read the history of the USS Franklin and her men, their courage only serves as a counterbalance to the injustices suffered by some crew members. With time and research, their actions have been vindicated  and blame assigned to the commander's inability to recognize the importance of a Naval Commander's respect for his crew, decisions made and actions taken.The cinematography is above average for original footage and the incorporated interviews (with real time photographs) allows for smooth transitions without detractions.In truth, honor must be lost to be restored . . . a dramatic and interesting documentary/drama.",5,Honor must be lost to be restored . . .,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,943,"['anyone', 'interested', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Naval/Military', 'history', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'presented', 'documentary', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'recognize', 'courage', 'dedication', 'duty', 'men', 'been', 'preserved', 'poignant', 'personal', 'way', 'definitive', 'naval', 'action', 'one', 'read', 'history', 'USS', 'Franklin', 'men', 'courage', 'only', 'counterbalance', 'injustices', 'suffered', 'crew', 'members', 'time', 'research', 'actions', 'have', 'been', 'vindicated', 'blame', 'assigned', 'commander', 'inability', 'recognize', 'importance', 'Naval', 'Commander', 'respect', 'crew', 'decisions', 'made', 'actions', 'taken.The', 'cinematography', 'above', 'average', 'original', 'footage', 'incorporated', 'interviews', 'real', 'time', 'photographs', 'smooth', 'transitions', 'detractions.In', 'truth', 'honor', 'must', 'be', 'lost', 'be', 'restored', 'dramatic', 'interesting', 'documentary/drama']",USS Franklin: Honored Restored

To go through what they all went through gives me great Pride. Going through what they did, during the time they did is extraordinary. People never know how they would re-act in that situation. Please I am not here to offend anyone, but their are people in control of other lives when they are in command. There are good Commanding Officers and bad Commanding Officers. I served in the Navy for 25 years. And very proud of it. Everyone on board the USS Franklin served a purpose no matter how small they think it is. The crew members were fighting many things that day.

One story, the best story, is one of heroism and self sacrifice. The other, the lesser story, is one of a man, guilty in my estimation of several court martial-able offences, who distracts the navies notice with that old magicians trick, misdirection. Simply, for me, they should have left out the captains story. The captains personal story of incompetence and pettiness, mingled with the magnificent story of a ships company fighting to save their ship and each others lives, like candy and pickles eaten together, left a bad taste in the mouth.Just have two stories.
