I especially appreciate the episode where the children are supposed to go to the county fair; their grandmother gets hurt and is therefore unable to get her yard chores done (she needs help).At first, when their mother (children are Gracie and Drew) informs them they cannot go to the fair because their grandmother needs help, they try to get out of it so they can still go to the fair. Their attitude is not horrible, but they are not cheerful in doing what is right (this might be the best lesson learned). What I like about the lesson is that they are not corrected for some outrageous temper tantrum (which many parents allow their children to do) but for simply not having a cheerful attitude Boz corrects and instructs them (in real life it is the parents, but oh-well). So Boz helps the children have fun while helping their grandmother. He improves their attitude where they enjoyed doing the right thing instead of drudgingly doing their required task.Here are some great points to mention about the Boz series:The character's attitudes are always excellent toward one another. The children show respect for each other and reverence their parents. Unlike almost every children's cartoon or other video where people insult one another and have a bad attitude (in general), the Boz series displays the proper attitude that children should have. They show that a good attitude, love and respect for others, etc. is what is normal. No, it is not normal for your children to have a poor attitude, NEVER. Do not excuse your child's behavior, but rather properly train him (sorry for the side note but I felt it is important to note). The Boz series will reinforce you faithfully and consistently training your children to have a good attitude at all times. I have never seen even a Christian children's series that so successfully and uncompromisingly sticks to these values.The Baxter family always remember to thank God at the end of each day/episode which is extremely important.No, this video series is not perfect and there are things I would have done differently (for sure) but this is a good starting point to go in the right direction. I wish their were videos like this for older children that promote character qualities such as bravery, honor, loyalty, courage, dignity (character of a man of God that are too often missing from Christian children's videos).So overall, I give a 5 star rating because its the best I've seen in the Christian children's market in DVD cartoons.",5,Instills desirable character attributes in your children,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,2639,"['particular', 'Boz', 'video', 'probably', 'best', 'Thank', 'God', 'Friends', 'Helpers', 'theme', 'helping', 'others', 'who', 'are', 'need', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'episode', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'supposed', 'go', 'county', 'fair', 'grandmother', 'hurt', 'therefore', 'unable', 'get', 'yard', 'done', 'help', '.At', 'first', 'when', 'mother', 'children', 'are', 'Gracie', 'Drew', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'fair', 'grandmother', 'help', 'try', 'get', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'fair', 'attitude', 'not', 'horrible', 'are', 'not', 'cheerful', 'doing', 'what', 'right', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'lesson', 'learned', 'What', 'like', 'lesson', 'are', 'not', 'corrected', 'outrageous', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'many', 'parents', 'allow', 'children', 'do', 'simply', 'not', 'having', 'cheerful', 'attitude', 'Boz', 'corrects', 'real', 'life', 'parents', 'oh-well', 'So', 'Boz', 'children', 'have', 'fun', 'helping', 'grandmother', 'attitude', 'where', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'instead', 'drudgingly', 'doing', 'required', 'are', 'great', 'points', 'mention', 'Boz', 'series', 'character', 'attitudes', 'are', 'always', 'excellent', 'one', 'children', 'show', 'respect', 'other', 'reverence', 'parents', 'almost', 'children', 'cartoon', 'other', 'video', 'where', 'people', 'insult', 'one', 'have', 'bad', 'attitude', 'general', 'Boz', 'series', 'proper', 'attitude', 'children', 'should', 'have', 'show', 'good', 'attitude', 'love', 'respect', 'others', 'etc', 'what', 'normal', 'No', 'not', 'normal', 'children', 'have', 'poor', 'attitude', 'NEVER', 'Do', 'not', 'excuse', 'child', 'behavior', 'rather', 'properly', 'train', 'sorry', 'side', 'note', 'felt', 'important', 'note', 'Boz', 'series', 'will', 'reinforce', 'faithfully', 'consistently', 'training', 'children', 'have', 'good', 'attitude', 'times', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'even', 'Christian', 'children', 'series', 'so', 'successfully', 'uncompromisingly', 'sticks', 'values.The', 'Baxter', 'family', 'always', 'remember', 'thank', 'God', 'end', 'day/episode', 'extremely', 'important.No', 'video', 'series', 'not', 'perfect', 'are', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'sure', 'good', 'starting', 'point', 'go', 'right', 'direction', 'wish', 'were', 'videos', 'older', 'children', 'promote', 'character', 'qualities', 'such', 'bravery', 'honor', 'loyalty', 'courage', 'dignity', 'character', 'man', 'God', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'missing', 'Christian', 'children', 'videos', '.So', 'overall', 'give', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Christian', 'children', 'market', 'DVD', 'cartoons']",BOZ.

The fact is, my twin girls love this and want to continue to watch it over and over again.  It doesn't give me a headache, and I wonder if the reason some parents say ""enough's enough"" is because they have a short attention span and want something new all the time.  I sometimes wonder who has the issue - the children or Parents!!This is a wonderful series, and it incorporates a faith-based message, and I believe that children have become drawn to it because it is different, and you will not see it on Public Broadcasting anytime soon.  This is NOT Barney.  Let's get this straight.

980782,A3KTKOY77QGBC1,B000EYA084,Melissa,"[6, 10]","**UPDATE** (Aug. 19, 2006) My intention wasn't to down the series or be ""mean spirited"" I do appreciate the series, and yes, I notice that the children pray. I still reccommend this series. I, myself, was a child who loved to watch movies over and over like my son does now. He constantly watches Thomas the train, and all that, and he is currently on a ""Veggie Tales"" kick, which I NEVER get tired of. I still watch the same favorite movies of mine frequently as well.I do like Boz. I later found out that Boz, indeed, was fashioned after Barney by people who had created/worked with Barney previously. So, while Boz isn't Barney himself, he does have some similar traits and demeanors.... not that that's bad, mind you.If this review has been perceived negatively, I would like to clarify that it wasn't my intention, and I truly do support this series. My son has actually watched it a few more times and has taken a better liking to it as well.***This one is just as good, if not better, than the colors and shapes one. (See my review of that one) My review of that one is about the same as this one.I likes these DVDs, but like I explained in my other review, they need to tone it down a tad and make it more realistic. They don't need to pour on the Barney type fun in order for the child to enjoy it. In fact, too much of that and they either tire themselves out after they go nuts over it, or they get bored with it (like my son currently is right now, as he is watching it).These DVDs are worth getting, and the kids will like it.But obviously, parents will only be able to endure so much before they say, ""Ok, that's enough for now. We'll watch it later after my headache is gone.""
