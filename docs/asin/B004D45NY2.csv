1396589,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B004D45NY2,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[7, 9]","This is the story of a ghetto shopowner who dotes on a young lady in the neighborhood. They are bewithched by a pseudo minister of the Nation of Islam who pretends to want a business partnership but really wants to use it as a drug front.The acting is great and the performances are powerful (espcially Henry Brown as Moses, the shopkeeper with integrity and the actor who plays ""Sonny,"" his mentally challlenged assistant), but the tale itself is hokey and you can pretty much tell what will happen early on in the movie. The fake NOI leader comes in spouting stale and cliched Black Power rhetoric that was played out since the 60s. It is plausible that the naive young girl could be bamboozled by this handsome slickster, but how a man as worldly as Moses could fall for this baloney and ""tricknollogy"" (as the real NOI would put it) is beyond credibility. Early on, the phoney preacher lays down $60,000 without (apparent) strings attached to Moses for his share in the business. Come on! Ray Charles could see that there is something fishy in Denmark (or in this case, Oakland), here. Once again, the Moses character appears to be too smart to give this bogus black leader the time of day!After this implausability, the rest of the film becomes hopelessly predictable and you can fill in the dots before each scene.That aside, it's okay for leave your brains at the door entertainment on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",3,"Good acting and powerful performances, but......",1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,1417,"['story', 'ghetto', 'shopowner', 'who', 'young', 'lady', 'neighborhood', 'are', 'bewithched', 'pseudo', 'minister', 'Nation', 'Islam', 'who', 'want', 'business', 'partnership', 'really', 'use', 'drug', 'front.The', 'acting', 'great', 'performances', 'are', 'powerful', 'espcially', 'Henry', 'Brown', 'Moses', 'shopkeeper', 'integrity', 'actor', 'who', 'Sonny', 'mentally', 'challlenged', 'assistant', 'tale', 'hokey', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'tell', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'early', 'movie', 'fake', 'NOI', 'leader', 'spouting', 'stale', 'cliched', 'Black', 'Power', 'rhetoric', 'was', 'played', 'out', '60s', 'plausible', 'naive', 'young', 'girl', 'could', 'be', 'bamboozled', 'handsome', 'slickster', 'how', 'man', 'as', 'worldly', 'Moses', 'could', 'fall', 'baloney', 'tricknollogy', 'real', 'NOI', 'would', 'put', 'credibility', 'Early', 'phoney', 'preacher', 'down', '60,000', 'apparent', 'strings', 'attached', 'Moses', 'share', 'business', 'Come', 'Ray', 'Charles', 'could', 'see', 'something', 'fishy', 'Denmark', 'case', 'Oakland', 'here', 'Once', 'again', 'Moses', 'character', 'be', 'too', 'smart', 'give', 'bogus', 'black', 'leader', 'time', 'day', 'implausability', 'rest', 'film', 'hopelessly', 'predictable', 'can', 'fill', 'dots', 'scene.That', 'aside', 'okay', 'leave', 'brains', 'door', 'entertainment', 'lazy', 'Sunday', 'afternoon']",Everyday Black Man
