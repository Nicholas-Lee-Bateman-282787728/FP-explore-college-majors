1396448,A2A1HXFSAPA9A5,B004CYVZ4K,S. Der,"[0, 0]","I love skating movie and have seen all 4 movies. Would anyone had guess this title would get 3 sequel!?!?! I didn't. I honestly didn't know there was, but I just finished watching all 3 sequels today. Out of the 3 movie sequels, I felt this one is the best sequel!Let me first start off by saying, I don't mind watching the same movie plot thrown at me. At least these movies were under the same name. Other movies will try to copy or steal other movies plot's, but these movies have the right to do so. That's why I watched all 3 sequels. I knew that they were going to just do the same thing as the original, but with different lead actors. I don't mind that. I watched this movie for the chemistry and see if the actors are believe able and the skating.Now, the acting was pretty good. I believed the main actors, but the supporting cast just sucked. The skating wasn't all too great this time around. I felt they rushed though the whole movie and just barely touched the skating element of it and kept the main focus on the love story. These two only skated on air twice during the whole movie?!The movie really tries to do something new with the skating by introducing a new move into the mix. No more Pamchenko folks. This the the Macanator! A.K.A The Amazing Delgado! So, what is that? It basically was build up to be this amazing difficult move that will raise the bar for their skating. I don't what happened for skating but it seemed the level of difficult has dropped a lot since the first movie. When I actually saw the movie, it left me stun. Not because it was so amazing. It was so lame and dull. Basically, the male lead tosses the female lead high into the air and she spans and lands. WTF??? I seen skaters do that all the time. In fact, in the first movie, Doug and Kate first move during of Olympic games was this exact move! What's so hard about it? Was it just because Alex was upside down first and then flip back upright then going into the move? Because that wasn't that hard for them to do. This left me shocked and disappointed as the movie ended right after. There was no reaction from the crowd, coaches, commentators, or anyone. Not even the skaters said anything about it. That was total waste of a climax moment.I really felt the love story took too much out of the movie and that's why the movie didn't have enough staking. The skaters had somewhat a romantic connections, but I felt the last two squeals had of a connections than these two. Most of the time, I felt these two were just too confused about each other than love each other. Also, this was the first sequel to show the skaters go all the way with each other. The last two sequels barely had the couples kiss and that's it. This movie shows the leads go the distances and then some.I'm not going to be hard on this movie and give it a 1 or 2 stars because I felt the movie did keep up with the traditional plot. It tried to do something new at the end, even though it didn't work out for me. It showed the leads can do more than kiss in the movie. Yes, I would give this a 3 stars. I recommend this movie, if you like all the rest of the Cutting Edge movies, you should watch this too then.",3,Less than expected,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",2014,3186,"['love', 'skating', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', '4', 'movies', 'Would', 'anyone', 'had', 'guess', 'title', 'would', 'get', '3', 'sequel', 'did', ""n't"", 'honestly', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', '3', 'sequels', 'today', '3', 'movie', 'sequels', 'felt', 'one', 'best', 'sequel', 'Let', 'first', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'same', 'movie', 'plot', 'thrown', 'least', 'movies', 'were', 'same', 'name', 'Other', 'movies', 'will', 'try', 'copy', 'steal', 'other', 'movies', 'plot', 'movies', 'have', 'right', 'do', 'so', 'why', 'watched', '3', 'sequels', 'knew', 'were', 'going', 'just', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'original', 'different', 'lead', 'actors', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watched', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'see', 'actors', 'are', 'believe', 'able', 'skating.Now', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'believed', 'main', 'actors', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'sucked', 'skating', 'was', ""n't"", 'all', 'too', 'great', 'time', 'felt', 'rushed', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', 'barely', 'touched', 'skating', 'element', 'kept', 'main', 'focus', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'only', 'skated', 'air', 'twice', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'really', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'skating', 'introducing', 'new', 'move', 'mix', 'more', 'Pamchenko', 'folks', 'Macanator', 'A.K.A', 'Amazing', 'Delgado', 'So', 'what', 'basically', 'was', 'build', 'up', 'be', 'amazing', 'difficult', 'move', 'will', 'raise', 'bar', 'skating', 'do', ""n't"", 'what', 'happened', 'skating', 'seemed', 'level', 'difficult', 'dropped', 'lot', 'first', 'movie', 'When', 'actually', 'saw', 'movie', 'left', 'stun', 'Not', 'was', 'so', 'amazing', 'was', 'so', 'lame', 'dull', 'Basically', 'male', 'lead', 'female', 'lead', 'high', 'air', 'spans', 'lands', 'WTF', 'seen', 'skaters', 'do', 'time', 'fact', 'first', 'movie', 'Doug', 'Kate', 'first', 'move', 'Olympic', 'games', 'was', 'exact', 'move', 'What', 'so', 'hard', 'Was', 'just', 'Alex', 'was', 'upside', 'down', 'first', 'then', 'flip', 'back', 'upright', 'then', 'going', 'move', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'hard', 'do', 'left', 'shocked', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'ended', 'right', 'was', 'reaction', 'crowd', 'coaches', 'commentators', 'anyone', 'Not', 'even', 'skaters', 'said', 'anything', 'was', 'total', 'waste', 'climax', 'moment.I', 'really', 'felt', 'love', 'story', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'why', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'staking', 'skaters', 'had', 'somewhat', 'romantic', 'connections', 'felt', 'last', 'two', 'squeals', 'had', 'connections', 'two', 'Most', 'time', 'felt', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'confused', 'other', 'other', 'Also', 'was', 'first', 'sequel', 'show', 'skaters', 'go', 'way', 'other', 'last', 'two', 'sequels', 'barely', 'had', 'couples', 'kiss', 'movie', 'leads', 'go', 'distances', 'then', 'some.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'movie', 'give', '1', '2', 'stars', 'felt', 'movie', 'did', 'keep', 'up', 'traditional', 'plot', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'end', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'showed', 'leads', 'can', 'do', 'more', 'kiss', 'movie', 'Yes', 'would', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'recommend', 'movie', 'like', 'rest', 'Cutting', 'Edge', 'movies', 'should', 'watch', 'too', 'then']",Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice
