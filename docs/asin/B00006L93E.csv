Kincaid ""angel""","[0, 0]","Well considering that this flick was something that my film group got out for a &quot;bad movie marathon&quot; I really wasn't expecting that much, and indeed there were some compleatly cornball lines and bad acting.However, the film was still interesting enough to make me want to see it again, MINUS, the friends doing the MST3000 impression in the back ground.So I did, and what I found when I was acutally able to watch sans people threateing the one who brought it with wild dingos, was a rather compleing film.For a group of people who are doing this as a first attempt at film making it's a good start. The actors seem to be new at it, but they give good performances in most places, and there are some sceens that make one cringe not in their cheezball natuer but in horror like and good vamp flick should.Its also a good display of how indpendants can get what the want on the screen if they really want to bad enough.So to sum this all up, I wouldnt tell you to go out of your way to find this film. But if you happen to spot it on the 8.99 rack at your local wally world then get it. If nothing else it's commentary is a good instruction book on how to get your own film makeing carreer going of you are an aspiering director.",3,Tacky but Fun,1085356800,"05 24, 2004",2004,1237,"['Well', 'considering', 'flick', 'was', 'something', 'film', 'group', 'got', 'out', 'quot', 'bad', 'movie', 'marathon', 'quot', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'indeed', 'were', 'compleatly', 'cornball', 'lines', 'bad', 'acting.However', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'interesting', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'MINUS', 'friends', 'doing', 'MST3000', 'impression', 'back', 'ground.So', 'did', 'what', 'found', 'when', 'was', 'acutally', 'able', 'watch', 'sans', 'people', 'threateing', 'one', 'who', 'brought', 'wild', 'dingos', 'was', 'rather', 'compleing', 'film.For', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'first', 'attempt', 'film', 'making', 'good', 'start', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'new', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'most', 'places', 'are', 'sceens', 'make', 'one', 'cringe', 'not', 'cheezball', 'natuer', 'horror', 'good', 'vamp', 'flick', 'should.Its', 'also', 'good', 'display', 'how', 'indpendants', 'can', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'screen', 'really', 'want', 'bad', 'enough.So', 'sum', 'up', 'wouldnt', 'tell', 'go', 'way', 'find', 'film', 'happen', 'spot', '8.99', 'rack', 'local', 'wally', 'world', 'then', 'get', 'nothing', 'else', 'commentary', 'good', 'instruction', 'book', 'how', 'get', 'own', 'film', 'makeing', 'carreer', 'going', 'are', 'aspiering', 'director']",N/A

It is definately one for the bargin bin, but if you are a collector,  as I, then it's worth having in your collection. Don't exect spectaular effects, it's pretty much just a half step above a B movie. If your strickly into vampires, then you probably won't like it, but if you like Sci-Fi, then it's passible. It's true, the dialouge is terrible and some of the acting is pretty amature, but for the price (I got mine under 6 bucks) and if you like B movies, then it's cool. For a low budget the special effects aren't bad. The stroy line's a bit funny, because it seems to take parts from different movies, like the kevlar suit seems to come straight out of Batman, and the sword fight, from Highlander. If you don't mind low buget, brainless, entertainment, then it's ok.",3,Cool Sci-Fi Vampire Twist,1066003200,"10 13, 2003",2003,859,"['movie', 'got', 'lot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'probably', 'everyone', 'paid', 'too', 'much', 'definately', 'one', 'bargin', 'bin', 'are', 'collector', 'then', 'worth', 'having', 'collection', 'Do', ""n't"", 'exect', 'spectaular', 'effects', 'pretty', 'much', 'just', 'half', 'step', 'B', 'movie', 'strickly', 'vampires', 'then', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'like', 'Sci-Fi', 'then', 'passible', 'true', 'dialouge', 'terrible', 'acting', 'pretty', 'amature', 'price', 'got', 'mine', '6', 'bucks', 'like', 'B', 'movies', 'then', 'cool', 'low', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'stroy', 'line', 'bit', 'funny', 'take', 'parts', 'different', 'movies', 'kevlar', 'suit', 'come', 'straight', 'Batman', 'sword', 'fight', 'Highlander', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'low', 'buget', 'brainless', 'entertainment', 'then', 'ok']",N/A

It needed to be fleshed out a lot.  The acting was horable.  The special effects looked like they hired a kindergarden class to do them.  The filming looked to be done with a hand held camcorder.  The only reason it got one star was cause the picture on the cover was good enough to sucker me into renting this.

The box artwork and description sure made it sound interesting. It tries to be a combination of ""Blade"" and ""The Matrix"" at once and fails miserably on both goals.Very poorly executed in almost every possible way. It was apparently shot on a similar Sony digital camera system that Lucas used on the last Star Wars movie. But the picture on this film is only decent and looks quite fake and bright. In other words, it looks as if it was shot on digital video. Why they even bothered with that amazes me since this was obviously a very low-budget movie to begin with. The sound is also very poorly done, i could not even understand most of the dialogue throughout the film. We are talking about a very rough sound mix.Even a really bad Troma movie is Godly compared to this piece of cinematic garbage! Too bad there isn't a 0 rating on here.",1,"Utterly terrible as far as ""vampire movies"" go",1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,908,"['rented', 'expecting', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'vampire/horror', 'movie', 'box', 'artwork', 'description', 'sure', 'made', 'sound', 'interesting', 'be', 'combination', 'Blade', 'Matrix', 'once', 'miserably', 'goals.Very', 'poorly', 'executed', 'almost', 'possible', 'way', 'was', 'apparently', 'shot', 'similar', 'Sony', 'digital', 'camera', 'system', 'Lucas', 'used', 'last', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movie', 'picture', 'film', 'only', 'decent', 'quite', 'fake', 'bright', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'video', 'Why', 'even', 'bothered', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'begin', 'sound', 'also', 'very', 'poorly', 'done', 'i', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'understand', 'most', 'dialogue', 'film', 'are', 'talking', 'very', 'rough', 'sound', 'mix.Even', 'really', 'bad', 'Troma', 'movie', 'Godly', 'compared', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'garbage', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", '0', 'rating', 'here']",N/A

Grainy, badly done filming, over 95% of the movie was dubbed over instead of actually having the actors act. You can see the wires attacted to the actors when they are yanked backwards after a fake punch. And the plot stunk. It was a combo of Blade wannabe, Blair witch-ish documentary style and other stuff. The main character started out cool but turns out to be a real dork.And the villian. oh please, he looked like a reject from the a B-movie vampire movie. At least some B-Movies are funny to watch.

720046,A17OANOQ55L5HQ,B00006L93E,"R. Benson ""Dedwyre""","[0, 3]","Detailed plot: Michael Dorn, a hired chemist, creates a virus that turns people into artificial vampires (he was working on a cure for HIV).  Dorn is accidentally infected and goes on the run from his employers.  Those same employers, called ""The Counsel"", send a vampire ""half-breed"" and an Ex-Marine with a grudge after Dorn.  Meanwhile, Dorn finds out that the Counsel wanted a virus that made vampires and used the HIV cure as a cover-up, so he begins to systematically destroy everything and everyone involved.Pros: The plot and the writing is great.  If I could get a Hollywood movie budget and make the same movie with the same script, it would be superb.Cons: Bad acting (half of the actors have accents, half don't, and only one is good at delivering lines and facial acting), low budget special effects and cameras, cliffhanger ending.But, to tell the truth, despite the cons, the script really kept me interested and made me stay until the end.
