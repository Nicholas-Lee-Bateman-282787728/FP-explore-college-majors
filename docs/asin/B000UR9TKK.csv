However, the characters and plots were great.  Many times Raymond seems self affecting and elitist; but I guess he was the star of the show and everyone else had to look up to him.  Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts were the consummate character actors; in fact my late stepfather looked and acted just like him, and Brad Garrett was the ultimate second banana on the show. Sometimes Patricia Heaton could grate on you, but she held her lines well.

1096221,A1ARH7N0BEONSM,B000UR9TKK,Cassandra Dunkin,"[6, 8]","This is my first purchase of a complete series. I'm not a big fan of TV comedies.  Most of them seem crude, predictable and immature. However, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" presents a refreshing, real world comedy with warmth and intelligence. There are many poignant moments as Ray tries to define himself as a husband and father and get out from under his mother's thumb.  His brother Robert gradually evolves to get his own life even as he tries to disentangle himself from Marie's apron strings and an ongoing sibling rivalry.  Aside from being entertaining,  there are lessons to be learned about forgiveness, communication, sharing and enjoying the moment. The episodes are fresh and interesting and usually contain sensitive human insights.The set arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.  I have played the first 10 episodes so far. Except for a rare flicker in the picture on one DVD (which might have been caused by my DVD player) I am pleased with the quality.  I love the storage box - a house with faces of all the family looking at you through the windows - it makes a nice display.  The individual cases have sturdy cardboard sleeves with an additional paper liner to protect the playing surface of each disc.  It is great fun watching the series from the beginning. Each episode shows a picture and a brief synopsis of the plot which helps when you are trying to find your favorites among 210 episodes.  I have been watching 1 episode per night.  It provides my daily dose of laughter (which the Bible says is ""good medicine"") and the opportunity to unwind after a busy and/or stressful day.The purchase price of $199.00 seems reasonable for what was included.",5,Raymond's House of Laughter!,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,1681,"['first', 'purchase', 'complete', 'series', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'TV', 'comedies', 'Most', 'seem', 'crude', 'predictable', 'immature', 'However', 'Everybody', 'Raymond', 'refreshing', 'real', 'world', 'comedy', 'warmth', 'intelligence', 'are', 'many', 'poignant', 'moments', 'Ray', 'define', 'husband', 'father', 'get', 'mother', 'thumb', 'brother', 'Robert', 'gradually', 'get', 'own', 'life', 'even', 'disentangle', 'Marie', 'apron', 'strings', 'ongoing', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'Aside', 'being', 'entertaining', 'are', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'forgiveness', 'communication', 'sharing', 'enjoying', 'moment', 'episodes', 'are', 'fresh', 'interesting', 'usually', 'contain', 'sensitive', 'human', 'insights.The', 'set', 'arrived', 'timely', 'manner', 'good', 'condition', 'have', 'played', 'first', '10', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'rare', 'flicker', 'picture', 'one', 'DVD', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'caused', 'DVD', 'player', 'am', 'pleased', 'quality', 'love', 'storage', 'box', 'house', 'family', 'looking', 'windows', 'nice', 'display', 'individual', 'cases', 'have', 'sturdy', 'cardboard', 'additional', 'paper', 'liner', 'protect', 'playing', 'surface', 'disc', 'great', 'fun', 'watching', 'series', 'beginning', 'episode', 'picture', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'plot', 'when', 'are', 'trying', 'find', 'favorites', '210', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'watching', '1', 'episode', 'night', 'daily', 'dose', 'laughter', 'Bible', 'good', 'medicine', 'opportunity', 'unwind', 'busy', 'and/or', 'stressful', 'day.The', 'purchase', 'price', '199.00', 'reasonable', 'what', 'was', 'included']",Everybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series

Kind of like the literary series ""The Comedy of Interaction In Human Relationships"" by Chester Isaiah Muncie.  I could be saying that you might decide to purchase this, or you might not.  I could be saying (since this review surfaces between Thanksgiving and Christmas) that this might be under the Christmas tree or it might not.  I could be saying you may understand the serious side, the comedy side, and/or the psychology of human behavioral sciences; or you might not.  I could be referring to the marketing concept of packaging the complete series in a box that resembles the house frequently shown in the TV series.  I could be saying that instead of buying this one season at a time, you're the kind of person/fan who knows what they want and choose to dig for a bargain way to save money at the same time of getting what you want out of life.  Or I could be referring to parasitical viruses borne by pathogenic means that result in shivering, runny nose, and severe fatigue.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" requires being given a chance to grow on you, and a little history on each character actor / character actress (Peter Boyle was the monster on Mel Brook's film, ""Young Frankenstein"").

1096243,A2BNNU4ELFKK4N,B000UR9TKK,MollyRK,"[153, 181]","Probably not, if you're even visiting this Amazon page in the first place. As a widespread array of popular television shows are planning to release their final season DVD sets by the end of 2007 (""Full House,"" ""Gilmore Girls,"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" to name a few), they have all taken a similar path by releasing deluxe full-series collections at the same time. That, right there, is a currently growing trend that you can expect to find with every future television show that is being manufactured on DVD. When popular shows like this one reach the point where their final season is ready for release, the DVD companies must do something to keep their profits rolling. In order to reel in even the consumers who have already purchased the previous seasons, there is only one thing left to do: design some super-fancy packaging, promise a few little surprise bonuses that do not come with the original DVD's, produce a ""Complete Series"" set, and slap a $200 list price on it. After all, there is a slew of dedicated ""Raymond"" fans in the world, and for many of them, something like this is difficult to pass up.Now that we are all starting to see how many shows are going for the complete series appeal, we can learn to know better than to impulsively buy the individual seasons as they are pumped out--that is, if we care enough about the bigger and the better. It's a matter of preference, I guess, but I have always liked the packaging that ""Raymond"" has used for the DVD's. It's sturdy, the discs are easily accessible, and unlike the original ""Sex and the City"" packaging, it doesn't just fall apart the minute you take off the shrink wrap. For that reason, I will stick with what I have and look forward to September 19, when Season 9 officially arrives.However, if this set looks ideal to you, or if you love the show and would like to start collecting the DVD's, be prepared to shell out a good $200. These special editions look great, but they sure don't come cheap. Still, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is simply one of those contemporary classics that is worth every penny, and if you're looking for something with a solid, consistent blend of hilarity and poignancy, this absolutely fits the bill. The show began as slighty sluggish, yet brimming with potential, and the basic plot was easy for viewers to tap into. You've got the protagonist Ray Barone, a sportswriter who mostly lives up to the title of the series, but he often has a hard time pleasing his wife, his kids, his parents (who so conveniently reside right across the street), and his perpetually jealous younger brother all at once. The show was initially designed to take some universal conflicts within families, place a humorous spin on them, and perhaps prompt viewers to realize that maybe their own scenarios aren't quite so bad. Although the plot always attempts to (and typically succeeds at) depicting the reality of marriage and family life, they sometimes steer a little too far off the deep end, but that's the fun of the writing. The marital snits between Ray and Debra, Frank and Marie, and Robert and Amy are always interesting to watch, and the laughter comes just as naturally as the cringing when you observe Marie's perpetual hold on her husband, her grown sons, and her daughters-in-law. The majority of women will easily identify with Debra's frustrations against her occasionally selfish significant other, as well as Frank and Marie's apparent lack of understanding about a concept known as ""ringing the doorbell when you visit your son's home."" Robert's nonstop efforts to be noticed and achieve a rare edge over the lovable little brother ""Raymie"" (even if it's only for a few minutes) blends humor with sympathy for his character, and it's virtually impossible to keep a straight face whenever Frank blurts out one of his brilliantly scripted punch lines (""Holy crap!"") Can you ask for comedy that is any better than that? After watching just a few episodes (particularly those from Seasons 4-9), it's easy to see why this has been labeled as ""the sitcom of our times.""Then there are the three Barone kids, who don't take much precedence in the show, but are still worth mentioning. Ray Romano and series creator Phil Rosenthal always believed strongly in keeping the kids' screen time short and sweet, for the sake of preventing their series from sharing a similar category with shows like ""Full House."" Without the cutesy dialogue and professionally written, Olsen twin-style catch phrases that no real kid would ever even understand, oldest daughter Ally and twin sons Geoffrey and Michael succeeded in being a pleasure without being overused. Real-life siblings Madylin, Sawyer and Sullivan Sweeten did it just right. They were cute enough, while avoiding being too over-the-top or overtaking the whole show, and it wasn't hard to buy into them as authentic, true-to-life kids. No snappy comebacks, no smart-alecky wit, just real kids. Of course, this is the only series that could get away with having them make a quickie appearance, run upstairs, and staying away from the remainder of the episode while the adults had long, heated conversations that often led to screaming matches. How on Earth did those children manage to sleep through it when their parents were duking it out in episodes such as the Season 4 classic ""Bad Moon Rising?"" To those kinds of questions, we may never have an answer, but for the purpose that it served, it worked just fine, and it helped the intended plot move right along.Through it all, though, was it that helped the magic survive for 9 consistent years? Sure, the writing was excellent and always generated well-deserved laughter from the audience, but in the end, without the acting, it couldn't have happened. Plain and simple, the formula just would not have worked if Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Monica Horan, Doris Roberts, and Peter Boyle did not lead the cast with remarkable precision and skill. They each had their own special little quality that they brought to the mix (e.g. Ray's endearingly nasal voice, Amy's million dollar facial expressions). By the time Amy McDougal's painfully straight-laced parents (so un-Barone) and kooky younger brother made it to the fold in Season 7, it was evident that the casting was nearly flawless. There is perhaps no other television family that worked together as well as these seasoned stars, and defying what is natural with most shows, they only seemed to get better with time. Simply stated, they all just seemed to understand exactly what the script required, and when they got in front of the camera, they executed with impressive ease. They knew what it was all about, and through the family that they created together, the show became entirely their own. Beyond just being a talented and experienced group of actors, they delivered as a convincing American family that got at each other's throats half the time, but still managed to be strong and close-knit in their own way. As perfectly spoken by beloved actor Peter Boyle, ""Every character got the ball, and everyone got to score"" when it came to the razor-sharp dialogue, and that's exactly how any piece of solid television should be.With that being said, be sure to remember that this set is coming out on October 30, right in time for Halloween--and as long as we're talking about that holiday, don't forget to watch the hysterical ""Halloween Candy"" episode from Season 3 (whether you've seen it or not, it's some truly great stuff). If you've had a bad day at work, you're tired or just need a little break, ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is perfect for the spirits and can always be counted on to lighten the mood. As for this great big, newly designed edition, the outer box is slated to look like Ray and Debra's house, with all the main characters peeking out of the windows, and all 9 seasons will be placed under one roof (in this case, literally). Special features haven't been announced yet, but I wouldn't expect anything that hasn't already been on the previous sets. I mean, I guess it's possible that they'll add a few new things here and there, but for the most part, the $200 list price on this item is for the cool new packaging, some cast photos from over the years, maybe a new episode guide......things along those lines. If you're a fan who hasn't started buying the DVD's yet, this is the perfect excuse to do so; with all the episodes arranged and sold together, it's basically a dream come true for the hard-core Barone junkies.Maybe not everyone will agree with me when I say that it is one of the greatest shows ever made, but surely it's one of the best comedies out there, and in a society where complete series DVD's are becoming the norm, here's one of the ""best bets"" that will surely be watched and re-watched often enough to make the investment worth it!",5,All 210 episodes of Barone glory in one place!

Most who are interested in this set probably already know each of the 210 episodes by heart, so I'll describe the packaging. It looks so cute on display.  The roof lifts up to reveal the nine cases for each season.  They look like minis of the individual season cases with sturdy covers that open up like books. They are set in the house at different heights so they are easy to pull out.  Inside there is the episode list and photos like with the individual seasons.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves that have a photo of one of the 5 main characters with two quotes.  I know a lot of people are concerned about the cardboard sleeves scratching the discs. I will admit, they do fit rather tightly in the sleeves, but each sleeve has a paper backing that seems to protect the disc from scratches.  I have not noticed scratches on the ones I've pulled out so far but, I haven't played these discs enough yet to really test it.What I really like about the box set, besides it being so cute, is that it takes up less room than those big, bulky individual season sets.  It takes up a little more than six individual seasons worth, so that frees up a lot of space in my cabinet.  The discs have the same extras as the individuals seasons, plus you also get a book with the shooting script for ""The Finale.""  The autographs of the writers are facsimiles on the cover.  If the discs hold up (I've heard of disc protectors you can snap on called ""D-Skins,"" but I'm not sure they will fit with this setup) and with the reasonable price you can get this for on Amazon right now, I see no reason to keep those bulky individual sets, so up for sale they go!",5,"""This is where fun goes to die""--Raymond",1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,1684,"['just', 'got', 'house', 'great', 'Most', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'set', 'probably', 'already', 'know', '210', 'episodes', 'heart', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'packaging', 'so', 'cute', 'display', 'roof', 'up', 'reveal', 'nine', 'cases', 'season', 'look', 'minis', 'individual', 'season', 'cases', 'sturdy', 'covers', 'open', 'up', 'books', 'are', 'set', 'house', 'different', 'heights', 'are', 'easy', 'pull', 'out', 'episode', 'list', 'photos', 'individual', 'seasons', 'discs', 'are', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'have', 'photo', 'one', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'two', 'quotes', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'concerned', 'cardboard', 'scratching', 'discs', 'will', 'admit', 'do', 'fit', 'rather', 'tightly', 'sleeves', 'sleeve', 'paper', 'backing', 'protect', 'disc', 'scratches', 'have', 'not', 'noticed', 'scratches', 'ones', ""'ve"", 'pulled', 'out', 'so', 'far', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'discs', 'enough', 'yet', 'really', 'test', 'it.What', 'really', 'box', 'set', 'being', 'so', 'cute', 'up', 'less', 'room', 'big', 'bulky', 'individual', 'season', 'sets', 'up', 'little', 'more', 'six', 'individual', 'seasons', 'worth', 'up', 'lot', 'space', 'cabinet', 'discs', 'have', 'same', 'extras', 'individuals', 'seasons', 'also', 'get', 'book', 'shooting', 'script', 'Finale', 'autographs', 'writers', 'are', 'facsimiles', 'cover', 'discs', 'hold', 'up', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'disc', 'protectors', 'can', 'snap', 'called', 'D-Skins', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'fit', 'setup', 'reasonable', 'price', 'can', 'get', 'Amazon', 'right', 'now', 'see', 'reason', 'keep', 'bulky', 'individual', 'sets', 'so', 'sale', 'go']",Everybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series

I alternate between being horrified to the point of being unable to watch, to pleasantly amused.  My parents are of the same ""World War Two Generation"" as Frank and Marie--and I can see many of these same behaviors played out in our own life (although to a less extreme degree).This show has a really talented cast!  That said, I would like to say that I particularly like Patricia Heaton's portrayal of Debra.  In many ways, she is the prism through which we see the Barone family, and to watch the development of her character over the course of the series is fascinating.  Although her character begins the series as relatively sedate and low key, by the end of the series she is almost as paranoid, scheming, and manipulative as her nemesis and mother-in-law Marie.My private wish is for Patricia Heaton to play Hillary Clinton.  Both are from affluent midwestern suburbs, as is reflected in their accent and intonation.  Both have the ability to convey a particular type of authority.  With all of Ray's petty lies and convoluted plots to deceive Debra (often to step out with his ""mistress golf""), I could see the two of them doing a comic bit as Bill and Hillary.  But seriously now, Ray should not seek out the role of Bill Clinton.  Patricia Heaton, however, really should play Hillary Clinton completely straight.",5,Uncanny in its evocation of family life--and Patricia Heaton should play Hillary Clinton,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1565,"['Anybody', 'who', 'married', 'aware', 'complex', 'mesh', 'relationships', 'involving', 'spouse', 'children', 'parents', 'siblings', 'in-laws', 'relatives', 'neighbors', 'co-workers', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'appreciate', 'trials', 'Raymond', 'Debra', 'company', 'alternate', 'being', 'horrified', 'point', 'being', 'unable', 'watch', 'pleasantly', 'amused', 'parents', 'are', 'same', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'Generation', 'Frank', 'Marie', 'can', 'see', 'many', 'same', 'behaviors', 'played', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'less', 'extreme', 'degree', '.This', 'show', 'really', 'talented', 'cast', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'particularly', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'portrayal', 'Debra', 'many', 'ways', 'prism', 'see', 'Barone', 'family', 'watch', 'development', 'character', 'course', 'series', 'fascinating', 'character', 'series', 'relatively', 'sedate', 'low', 'key', 'end', 'series', 'almost', 'paranoid', 'scheming', 'manipulative', 'nemesis', 'mother-in-law', 'Marie.My', 'private', 'wish', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'play', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'are', 'affluent', 'midwestern', 'suburbs', 'reflected', 'accent', 'intonation', 'have', 'ability', 'convey', 'particular', 'type', 'authority', 'Ray', 'petty', 'lies', 'convoluted', 'plots', 'deceive', 'Debra', 'often', 'step', 'out', 'mistress', 'golf', 'could', 'see', 'two', 'doing', 'comic', 'bit', 'Bill', 'Hillary', 'seriously', 'now', 'Ray', 'should', 'not', 'seek', 'out', 'role', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Patricia', 'Heaton', 'however', 'really', 'should', 'play', 'Hillary', 'Clinton', 'completely', 'straight']",Everybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series
