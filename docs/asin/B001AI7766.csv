This show is very different, the first episode I watched was an episode in the first book I believe where it shows Momo's story and Zuko's story where he goes out on a date with a girl, and I just thought what is this show really all about? Luckily nickelodeon was showing Avatar from the beginning that week for the beginning of the second season. I never missed an episode after that.After all the waiting for the third season to finish I really was expecting a fourth one, because we have the books of: Earth,Water, and Fire. The creators could have made another book about Aang's life, but maybe it was better the way they ended this. I hope I didn't spoil anything by saying that.I hope Avatar isn't ruined by M. Night Shyamalan, since he is planning on making an Avatar movie with real actors. Either way I will be buying this when it comes out, and I recommend it to anyone with or without children.

(I seriously suggest you watch Books One and Two if you haven't yet, this is NOT a season to watch without seeing other episodes.  I kindly recommend you stop reading now and look up book one).  The series gets darker and more action packed than ever as Aang and his friends struggle to defeat Firelord Ozai before the powerful Sozin's Comet returns.Compared to the other two seasons, book three is much more intense.  It's still kid friendly with good morals and fun laughs, but the action keeps coming and coming.  But it's not just a bunch of people riding flying bisons and flinging fireballs.  The show gets really deep at times, now more than ever.  Issues within as well as external are explored as characters search through their feelings, tragic backstories are revealed and terrifying enemies are encountered.  Feelings of love and romance are also flying around in the shadow of battles.  At first it was just Zuko trying to capture Aang to regain his honor.  Then it was Azula trying to capture Aang, who is a little more intense with her firebending.  Now they've got a crazy, nameless bald guy who can firebend with his mind and he's shooting to kill.The characters have developed considerably and they deal with a good bit of drama in this season.  Three years of airtime (one year by the show's timeline) has matured the characters.  Everyone is a little more serious, a little wiser (or crazier).  Zuko's anger is now directed at himself rather than others as he tries to find his purpose.  Aang is struggling with feeling guilty over times he messed up big and tries to have the mindset to stop (as in kill) Ozai by ANY means necessary.  Katara gets a lesson in revenge and forgiveness.  Sokka still keeps the corny jokes coming, but he's become a good leader.  On and on.  The lessons that appear in daily episodes haven't stopped coming, they just come in more dramatic and serious situations in this season.This description is probably making it sound like a soap opera with bending powers, so I will point out that comedy is still widely employed in this show.  There are plenty of silly moments and kid jokes and happy endings.  There's just a lot of danger and drama thrown into the mix....The twists and turns and fireworks continue to the inevitable battle between Aang and Ozai that has built up for three seasons (who didn't see it coming?) and the ending is pretty surprising.There is one episode in this season which is slightly scary.  I hate to ruin the surprise, but in the episode the group encounters a woman who discovered how to bend blood and she bends it maliciously.  While no actual blood is seen, the concept is probably the most intense thing covered on the show.  This is still a show suitable for kids, but this shows just how mature it's gotten.  Parents that are reading this for their kids, don't let this scare you away.  This is as bad as it gets and it's not that bad, but it is slightly scary.This show is very suspenseful and explores issues in a way that it can be enjoyable by any age and don't let the fact that it's a kid's show tell you otherwise!  I'm a 20-year-old college student and I think it's brilliant.  I think the show matured season-by-season to appeal to the target audience (kids and teens) as they grew up.  This can be for kids as young as, say, seven or eight, (any younger is ok but all they'll see are fireballs and martial arts) and for adults as old as they come.  The voice acting is very good, the story is exciting and the animation is really colorful and, well, animated.  I will note that of the three seasons Book Three imitates japanese-anime styles the most, usually in a silly moment like when Aang has nightmares about facing Ozai and discovers he forgot to wear his pants.This cartoon series is one for the ages.  Book Three is by far the best of the three seasons in what I think is one of the best adventure stories ever written.  It really is like a book; I tried to watch one or two episodes at a time but like a good book I couldn't put it down, or rather I couldn't stop watching.  I had to know what happened next.  The story of The Last Airbender is a very good show and I don't say that lightly.  Action, romance, suspense, philosophy, comedy and drama all enjoyable by adults and suitable for kids.  It's worth the thirty dollars.  Trust me, you will love it and your kids or parents or friends or whoever else you know will love it.  Everyone can appreciate it.",5,Worth every penny and every minute!,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,4563,"['*', 'minor', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '*Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'explosive', 'conclusion', 'Book', '3', 'Fire', 'seriously', 'suggest', 'watch', 'Books', 'One', 'Two', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'NOT', 'season', 'watch', 'seeing', 'other', 'episodes', 'kindly', 'recommend', 'stop', 'reading', 'now', 'look', 'up', 'book', 'one', 'series', 'darker', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'ever', 'Aang', 'friends', 'struggle', 'defeat', 'Firelord', 'Ozai', 'powerful', 'Sozin', 'Comet', 'returns.Compared', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'book', 'three', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'still', 'kid', 'friendly', 'good', 'morals', 'fun', 'laughs', 'action', 'coming', 'coming', 'not', 'just', 'bunch', 'people', 'riding', 'flying', 'bisons', 'flinging', 'fireballs', 'show', 'really', 'deep', 'times', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'Issues', 'as', 'well', 'external', 'are', 'explored', 'characters', 'search', 'feelings', 'tragic', 'backstories', 'are', 'revealed', 'terrifying', 'enemies', 'are', 'encountered', 'Feelings', 'love', 'romance', 'are', 'also', 'flying', 'around', 'shadow', 'battles', 'first', 'was', 'just', 'Zuko', 'trying', 'capture', 'Aang', 'regain', 'honor', 'Then', 'was', 'Azula', 'trying', 'capture', 'Aang', 'who', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'firebending', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'crazy', 'nameless', 'bald', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'firebend', 'mind', 'shooting', 'kill.The', 'characters', 'have', 'developed', 'considerably', 'deal', 'good', 'bit', 'drama', 'season', 'Three', 'years', 'airtime', 'one', 'year', 'show', 'timeline', 'matured', 'characters', 'Everyone', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'little', 'wiser', 'crazier', 'Zuko', 'anger', 'now', 'directed', 'rather', 'others', 'find', 'purpose', 'Aang', 'struggling', 'feeling', 'guilty', 'times', 'messed', 'up', 'big', 'tries', 'have', 'mindset', 'stop', 'kill', 'Ozai', 'ANY', 'means', 'necessary', 'Katara', 'lesson', 'revenge', 'forgiveness', 'Sokka', 'still', 'corny', 'jokes', 'coming', 'become', 'good', 'leader', 'lessons', 'appear', 'daily', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'coming', 'just', 'come', 'more', 'dramatic', 'serious', 'situations', 'season.This', 'description', 'probably', 'making', 'sound', 'soap', 'opera', 'bending', 'powers', 'will', 'point', 'out', 'comedy', 'still', 'widely', 'employed', 'show', 'are', 'plenty', 'silly', 'moments', 'kid', 'jokes', 'happy', 'endings', 'just', 'lot', 'danger', 'drama', 'thrown', 'mix', '.The', 'twists', 'turns', 'fireworks', 'continue', 'inevitable', 'battle', 'Aang', 'Ozai', 'built', 'up', 'three', 'seasons', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'ending', 'pretty', 'surprising.There', 'one', 'episode', 'season', 'slightly', 'scary', 'hate', 'ruin', 'surprise', 'episode', 'group', 'woman', 'who', 'discovered', 'how', 'bend', 'blood', 'maliciously', 'actual', 'blood', 'seen', 'concept', 'probably', 'most', 'intense', 'thing', 'covered', 'show', 'still', 'show', 'suitable', 'kids', 'just', 'how', 'mature', 'gotten', 'Parents', 'are', 'reading', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'scare', 'away', 'as', 'bad', 'not', 'bad', 'slightly', 'scary.This', 'show', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'issues', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'age', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'kid', 'show', 'tell', 'otherwise', ""'m"", '20-year-old', 'college', 'student', 'think', 'brilliant', 'think', 'show', 'matured', 'season-by-season', 'appeal', 'target', 'audience', 'kids', 'teens', 'grew', 'up', 'can', 'be', 'kids', 'as', 'young', 'say', 'seven', 'eight', 'younger', 'ok', ""'ll"", 'see', 'are', 'fireballs', 'martial', 'arts', 'adults', 'as', 'old', 'come', 'voice', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'story', 'exciting', 'animation', 'really', 'colorful', 'well', 'animated', 'will', 'note', 'three', 'seasons', 'Book', 'Three', 'japanese-anime', 'styles', 'most', 'usually', 'silly', 'moment', 'when', 'Aang', 'nightmares', 'facing', 'Ozai', 'discovers', 'forgot', 'wear', 'pants.This', 'cartoon', 'series', 'one', 'ages', 'Book', 'Three', 'far', 'best', 'three', 'seasons', 'what', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'adventure', 'stories', 'ever', 'written', 'really', 'book', 'tried', 'watch', 'one', 'two', 'episodes', 'time', 'good', 'book', 'could', ""n't"", 'put', 'down', 'rather', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'had', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next', 'story', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'lightly', 'Action', 'romance', 'suspense', 'philosophy', 'comedy', 'drama', 'enjoyable', 'adults', 'suitable', 'kids', 'thirty', 'dollars', 'Trust', 'will', 'love', 'kids', 'parents', 'friends', 'whoever', 'else', 'know', 'will', 'love', 'Everyone', 'can', 'appreciate']",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection

In our house, it was must see tv.  If you are unfamiliar with the show, you would definitely be best served to watch the first two seasons in advance. This way you would benefit from the back story. The production values and character development are first rate. Great background music and dialogue as well. This season is like the previous two in that not every episode is perfect (or will appeal to everyone), but that said, a ""weak"" episode of Avatar is better than most shows on tv (This is similar to how people rate Miyazaki movies that aren't their faves.).  I found this book of the series to be both wonderful and sad.  I loved how they tied most of the loose ends up, but was sad to see the series end.  Lastly, if you get/rent/view this book for the first time and like the characters, etc., you need to dedicate time to watch the last four episodes together.  I guarantee that you won't be happy if you don't.  Heck, you'll probably just blow off whatever it was you were planning on doing anyway to continue watching. It really is that captivating.

I just watched the final episode yesterday and felt inspired to share what I know.Avatar: The last Airbender is a solidly written/acted series with incredibly animated landscapes and a beauitful musical score.  This third season upheld the same standard set by its two predecessors.  I must admit I was bit upset at ""The Beach,"" but quickly forgave the show when it returned to its flawless formula.Why buy Avatar?  First, it is just as engrossing for adults (I'm 26) as it is entertaining for children (I often watch with my nieces: ages 1 & 3).  Second, this show has an amazing amount of heart and depth to it.  I found myself trying to write down some of the lines that were said.Third, the series is very clean.  Obviously, it is a cartoon, but I love this show more than LOST, House, or any other TV show that I normally watch partially due to its purity.  The perfect blend of story, character development, adventure, humor, and yes...even romance, all told through the eyes of a pure-hearted Airbender.If you are looking for a captivating and inspiring show that you can enjoy yourself and with your family without worrying about lowering your standards, then buy it!

Too bad most regular shows don't put this much thought, creativity and effort into their work. It really seems like the creators of this show created the whole world first and then developed a story that was consistent with it, rather than a story first and then coming up with the surroundings as they went along. I also really liked that they had a definite story with a clear end that they worked towards so that the series didn't descend into having a lot of unnecessary padding just to keep it running longer (like many other popular series, such as Lost and X-Files). In addition to the excellent story, the music is beautiful as well, particularly in this final season.

Their quest is to find and defeat Firelord Ozai. Along the way, they discover that Ozai has plans of his own. The leader of the Fire Nation intends to use the massive power of Sozin's Comet to spread his dominion permanently across the four nations. Short on time, Aang has a lot of bending to learn and no master to help him learn it. However, his friends are there to help, and he finds unexpected allies deep in the heart of the Fire Nation. In the spectacular four-part conclusion, Aang must fulfill his destiny and become a fully realized Avatar, or watch the world go up in smoke.

It's an experience that showcases friendship, courage, the difference between right and wrong, and just about every other moral-based theme. Never before has anything like this show ever aired on television, and nothing like it will ever happen again (Korra is amazing, but it's not the same). Book 3: Fire, showcases the epic finale of Aang having to face Firelord Ozai, as Sozin's comet is approaching with every passing day. Overcoming various obstacles, defeat and acquiring a new friend from the unlikeliest of places, the group then set off to save the world from fire, ready to bring about a new era of peace and prosperity.This TV series is pretty much The Lord of the Rings in animated form. The same themes are here (including a love theme), the action sequences are a marvel to be witnessed (being even better than most movies with action scenes), the drama escalates to emotional, tear-jerking moments, and the witty comedy helps to balance the serious overtones. Book 3 could not have gone any better, and when the finale does happen, you are in total awe of the spectacle the creators had in store. Now, even though some people do see this as just another cartoon series that aired on TV, they're completely wrong. Not everyone makes movies just for money, or for entertainment purposes. Films and TV shows sometimes carry deep messages that resonate within ourselves. Like how the Lord of the Rings re-shaped the ""epic film"" genre, Avatar: The Last Airbender completely re-shaped animated television shows. I just hope, in time, someone remakes the live-action film. I want to see Peter Jackson make it because, he could make a film trilogy that could live up to The Last Airbender name. And just because the show was centered to the kids audience, that doesn't mean the film can't be two and a half hours long or more. I'm just eternally grateful for this series; it was an important part in my life, and watching it through to the end always brings tears to my eyes.5/5 Stars*****",5,The Epic Conclusion to the Animated Epic,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2071,"['Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', ""n't"", 'just', 'cartoon', 'show', 'meant', 'kids', 'experience', 'friendship', 'courage', 'difference', 'right', 'wrong', 'just', 'about', 'other', 'moral-based', 'theme', 'Never', 'anything', 'show', 'ever', 'aired', 'television', 'nothing', 'will', 'ever', 'happen', 'again', 'Korra', 'amazing', 'not', 'same', '3', 'Fire', 'epic', 'finale', 'Aang', 'having', 'face', 'Firelord', 'Ozai', 'Sozin', 'comet', 'approaching', 'passing', 'day', 'Overcoming', 'various', 'obstacles', 'defeat', 'acquiring', 'new', 'friend', 'unlikeliest', 'places', 'group', 'then', 'set', 'off', 'save', 'world', 'fire', 'ready', 'bring', 'about', 'new', 'era', 'peace', 'prosperity.This', 'TV', 'series', 'pretty', 'much', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'animated', 'form', 'same', 'themes', 'are', 'here', 'including', 'love', 'theme', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'marvel', 'be', 'witnessed', 'being', 'even', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'action', 'scenes', 'drama', 'emotional', 'tear-jerking', 'moments', 'witty', 'comedy', 'balance', 'serious', 'overtones', 'Book', '3', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'better', 'when', 'finale', 'happen', 'are', 'total', 'awe', 'spectacle', 'creators', 'had', 'store', 'Now', 'even', 'people', 'do', 'see', 'just', 'cartoon', 'series', 'aired', 'TV', ""'re"", 'completely', 'wrong', 'Not', 'everyone', 'movies', 'just', 'money', 'entertainment', 'purposes', 'Films', 'TV', 'shows', 'sometimes', 'carry', 'deep', 'messages', 'resonate', 'how', 'Lord', 'Rings', 're-shaped', 'epic', 'film', 'genre', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'completely', 're-shaped', 'animated', 'television', 'shows', 'just', 'hope', 'time', 'someone', 'remakes', 'live-action', 'film', 'want', 'see', 'Peter', 'Jackson', 'make', 'because', 'could', 'make', 'film', 'trilogy', 'could', 'live', 'up', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'name', 'just', 'show', 'was', 'centered', 'kids', 'audience', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'long', 'more', ""'m"", 'just', 'eternally', 'grateful', 'series', 'was', 'important', 'part', 'life', 'watching', 'end', 'always', 'tears', 'eyes.5/5', 'Stars*****']",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection

The perfidious Fire nation is attacking and taking over the world and it's up to Aang the Avatar (kind of like a fighting Dalai Lama character) to learn all for types of bending and defeat the Fire Nation and return the world to peace.What's there to like? It's all about the characters, characters and characters. The characters in this series are so full of life and so well done that you just have to love them. Whoever crafted the characters should get all the credit in fleshing them out. A series lives or dies on it's characters and this series definitely blooms.And the writing is just great.

This was the original thought brought out by many people when Avatar first aired on Nickelodeon, not giving the show much of a thought.  As it continued to progress, however, more and more of the population began to realize the true depth of the show.  Clearly this was not just a show for children. In fact, as the show progressed through the first and second books, there were messages and symbols that were more directed at young adults, possibly even adults themselves!What made the show such a success was the excellent story telling, given it a simple idea yet complex plot.  The characters were well developed throughout and continue to reach their different destinies or wrestle with their own inner struggles.  The show continued to peak until it's climatic final four episodes, giving the viewers an incredible ending that they were waiting for!I would highly recommend this show to everyone!  Seeing as this book is the third in a trilogy series, I would begin with Book 1: Water and then Book 2: Earth, otherwise you would not understand the whole expanse of the story.  As I said before, the show is not directed only at children.  Adults can appreciate the rich development of plot and characters and the underlying meaning presented.In this box set, you receive all 22 twenty minute episodes in Book 3: Fire on 4 discs, including a 5th disc with a few special features and commentaries.  The discs run very smooth, having excellent quality to both picture and sound.  The price is right also, dropping to roughly $20 plus shipping.So, if you're looking for a great show that's both afforadable and captivating, I would purchase this set!

You really come to love the Avatar world by the end.  The stories behind the villain characters are also well-done.  It was great to see so much effort put there.  The humor was also surprisingly pretty good sometimes.  I loved the episode where they watched the play about themselves.  It was very entertaining and you could tell the writers had fun with it.I find it interesting that people call this an ""anime"" and then are corrected that it isn't.  It does have the sort of ""anime"" feel in that it actually has a decent story, and the story itself seems similar to something you might see in an anime.  There is also the eastern cultural influence in some of the culture in this show.  Yes it wasn't produced in Japan, but I think the style of the show is similar enough.

Just when I thought The Clone Wars would be the only spectacular animated tv series, I was proven wrong as soon as I saw Avatar. Each season kept upping the ante not to mention the stakes and kept us holding our breath up to the series finale which was huge visually and an exemplary battle that blew Crossroads and Siege out of the water. My only criticism of season 3 is the lack of Iroh. It would have been great to see how he escaped or to have seen him present Zuko as the Fire Lord.Many people have described that creating a prequel Book 4 would benefit the series and satisfy the fans including me. They could include the episodes of Aang's birth and revelation of his being the Avatar. How he met Appa and how he was trained by the monks and Gyatso.For those who want a sequel to the show, here is a story to satisfy you: After five years Zuko has successfully brought the Fire Nation back to the way it was before his Great Grandfather's regime while Aang has helped him clear the world of any remnants of the Fire Nation Army and revive the tradition of the air nomads. Aang has great news, he and Katara are getting married. Zuko also has good news, he has news about his mother's location. Meanwhile Azula helps her father get out of prison and has discovered a way to get his bending back using a fragment of Sozin's Comet.

1165869,A1EEG7YJIYN60B,B001AI7766,Lesley Aeschliman,"[1, 2]","The Book 3 Collection for Avatar: The Last Airbender has the final twenty-one episodes of the series on four discs, and a fifth disc in the set contains some bonus material.  These episodes finally bring about the end of Aang's story; however, in my opinion, there are several ""filler"" episodes at the beginning of this set.  And since there was a bit of ""filler"" earlier on, it forced the change that happens to Zuko to be a little more rushed than it should have been.  Overall, though, I am happy with how the series ended.On the first disc of the set, there is audio commentary for the episodes ""Sokka's Master"" and ""The Beach.""  On the second disc, there is audio commentary for ""The Avatar and the Firelord"" and ""The Day of Black Sun, Part 1: The Invasion.""  The third disc contains audio commentary for ""The Day of Black Sun, Part 2: The Eclipse"" and ""The Western Air Temple.""  And the final disc has audio commentary on all six of the episodes included on it.The bonus disc contains three special features.  The first is labeled as ""The Women of Avatar: The Last Airbender.""  While I appreciate the thought and the intent of this feature, I think the actual execution could have been done better.  The second extra is ""Book 3 Final Pencul Test Animation.""  The final extra is ""Into the Fire Nation,"" which is from the Avatar: The Last Airbender panel at the 2007 San Diego ComiCon.  In some respects, I thought these bonus features weren't as strong as the bonuses that were included on the Book 1 and Book 2 collections.Even with my disappointment with the bonus features, I would still recommend this box set to a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender.",4,The final season of Avatar: The Last Airbender,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,1658,"['Book', '3', 'Collection', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'final', 'twenty-one', 'episodes', 'series', 'four', 'discs', 'fifth', 'disc', 'set', 'bonus', 'material', 'episodes', 'finally', 'bring', 'end', 'Aang', 'story', 'however', 'opinion', 'are', 'several', 'filler', 'episodes', 'beginning', 'set', 'was', 'bit', 'filler', 'earlier', 'forced', 'change', 'Zuko', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'rushed', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'Overall', 'am', 'happy', 'how', 'series', 'first', 'disc', 'set', 'audio', 'commentary', 'episodes', 'Sokka', 'Master', 'Beach', 'second', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Avatar', 'Firelord', 'Day', 'Black', 'Sun', 'Part', '1', 'Invasion', 'third', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Day', 'Black', 'Sun', 'Part', '2', 'Eclipse', 'Western', 'Air', 'Temple', 'final', 'disc', 'audio', 'commentary', 'six', 'episodes', 'included', 'it.The', 'bonus', 'disc', 'contains', 'three', 'special', 'features', 'first', 'labeled', 'Women', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'appreciate', 'thought', 'intent', 'feature', 'think', 'actual', 'execution', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'second', 'extra', 'Book', '3', 'Final', 'Pencul', 'Test', 'Animation', 'final', 'extra', 'Fire', 'Nation', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'panel', '2007', 'San', 'Diego', 'ComiCon', 'respects', 'thought', 'bonus', 'features', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'strong', 'bonuses', 'were', 'included', 'Book', '1', 'Book', '2', 'collections.Even', 'disappointment', 'bonus', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'box', 'set', 'fan', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender']",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection

Fortunately, Aang is alive - not that that should come as a surprise to us, since the show is named after Aang. Overall a good episode that kicked off the third and final season.The Beach - This episode is split between Zuko and his sister and her friends, and the Avatar Gang. I was not impressed with the Fire kids part of the episode - too much whining and angsting going on, plus we never do learn just why Li and Lo are so important to the royal family. They were apparently not Firebenders, yet they work with Azula on her Firebending training and now the kids are going to be staying with them instead of the Royal Summer Palace. Are Li and Lo great aunts or something? This is never explained to us.The Avatar Gang-centric part of the episode was definitely better as the kids try to escape Combustion Man, the deadly assassin sent after them.Nightmares and Daydreams - The end of this season (and series) left quite a few questions to be answered, and this episode should have been used to answer them. Instead all we got was this filler with a lot of nonsense in it. I found this a bore to sit through, wondering when I would actually learn something new.The Southern Raiders - This episode would have gotten five stars from me, but it had gaping plot holes and annonsensical ending. I did like the Zuko/Katara interaction as well as Katara's argument with Aang.First of all, who told Yon Rha that there was still a Waterbender left in the Southern Tribe? This is never cleared up, and it would have greatly helped the story if Yon Rha had said where he got his information.Secondly... for Katara to just walk away after confronting Yon Rha was the biggest cop-out I've seen on this show. This jerk MURDERED her mother and she doesn't even beat him around at the very least. After all the work she and Zuko did in finding this slimeball, and they just let him off scot-free?

But first Aang must find someone to become his firebending teacher, and he must find the Fire Lord before the comet reaches Earth, bringing devastation to the nations. Let's back up for a minute, though, and remind ourselves what show we're watching, shall we?In this world, people known as benders have the ability to control one of the four elements. The Avatar, a living manifestation of the spirit of the Earth, has the ability to control all four elements, and has the duty of keeping the balance between all benders. As stated in the intro, the four nations (Air Nomads, Fire Nation, the Northern and Southern Water Tribes, and the Earth Kingdom) once all lived in harmony. The ambitious Fire Lord Sozin launced an attack on the other nations, and just when the world truly needed the Avatar, he vanished from existence. One hundred years have passed and two Water Tribe siblings (Katara, the last waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe, and her brother Sokka, a non-bender) discover and awaken the long missing Avatar, a twelve year old airbender named Aang, and his flying sky-bison, Appa.In the time Aang has been dormant, the Fire Nation have continued their campaign to rule over all nations. All Southern waterbenders aside from Katara have been killed or incarcerated; a large amount of the Earth Kingdom has been occupied by their forces; and due to the now deceased Sozin knowing that the next Avatar was destined to be an airbender, the Air Nomads have been completely wiped out, leaving Aang the last of his kind. He has no time to grieve though, because an event known as Sozin's Comet is soon going to pass by the land. The firebenders are going to harness the power from this comet to make their final strike and officially be in control of all nations. Aang must master the other three elements and defeat the current Fire Lord, Ozai.In this volume, Aang must recover from his near fatal wound he sustained during the coup of Ba Sing Se. Even more troubling, though, is that Aang still has yet to master the art of firebending. Still believing that no good can come from the most dangerous form of bending, Aang is apprehensive to give it a try again, even though it is necessary to defeat Ozai. He finds an unlikely ally in Zuko, who is now determined to take down his father and sister and take his place on the throne, so that he may clear his name and return the Fire Nation to the peaceful place it once was. With the return of some familiar faces, the Gaang goes from four determined but ill prepared teens to a rag tag group of talented rebels determined to mend their world. Meanwhile, Ozai and Azula continue to grow stronger by the day. But just because the building is sturdy does not mean there are not cracks in the foundation.The special features in this volume are creator commentary, a Book 3 pencil test animation, Into the Fire Nation at SDCC, and a Women of Avatar featurette.And so this beloved series comes to an end! Looking back to the first appearances of each of these characters, you really see the character development shining through in this volume. Characters like Zuko have had complete turnarounds since their first appearances, and it is quite a sight to see something like Katara threatening the life of a Fire Nation citizen, or Zuko successfully redirecting lightning. It's almost like having a child grow up, seeing how far your favorite characters have come!And thus, Avatar is finished.

1165893,A2PPTN3DTD8QNW,B001AI7766,Rich Grace,"[0, 0]","I'll stick to reviewing the last season. My entire family has sat enthralled throughout the whole Avatar series. Probably a little intense for many young children, although ironically my daughter has grown up from 4 to 6+ years old watching this entire series. The third season gives fans the payoff, and while there is always substantial comic relief, there's also a lot more character development and a detectable character arc, far more than you would ever expect from a Nickelodeon series. (Hats off to Nickelodeon and their corporate masters, by the way, for getting this show on the air and seeing it through.)The graphics quality takes a big leap in the third season; colors look more saturated and a lot more 3-D modeling comes into play, with stunning results. Now, this isn't Bergman, but there are many emotional moments throughout the last few episodes of Season 3, but everything takes a back seat to the jaw-dropping enactment of the final battle between the Avatar and the Firelord.The entire series is something that anim fans can't miss; it's going to stand as a classic of its kind for a long time. The vocal acting, particularly by the fellows playing the Avatar and Zuko, is uniformly excellent. I've studied martial arts for lengthy periods in the past, and the verisimilitude and hard work and research involved in bringing these fight scenes and artful motions to the screen is close to 100% accurate. One scene I particularly liked was the Dancing Dragon form in an episode  on Season 3 Disc 3, where both Zuko and Aang both fully master firebending.I could go on and on.

Humor, fighting, character development, insights to the world's culture, other Avatar's personalities, more of Zuko and Iroh's stories. One great finale. This show really finished off with a bang, almost literally.Still out of all three seasons this one posses many obvious flaws compared to the others. More episodes feel like filler ones, more focus spent on action (athough it was to be expected, 3rd acts generally do that), Azula's maddness seems to be put there just for the sake of doing it. The fire lord didn't feel so menacing after they showed his face, I feel they should've waited untill either Zuko left or the first part of the finale. Finally everyone's bending seems to have gotten abnormally better after just two months or so and they are doing things I think are unatural (Where Katara freezes Azula but can still move and Azula's lighting levitation).That being said while season 3 is the worst season critique wise, the show remained just as good and fun to watch and I rank it as #2 for likability (Earth's first).

There is more action, more humor, even better animation than before (if that's possible), and...well, the war between the Aang/Katara and Zuko/Katara fans was never more evident than during this season. Mike and Bryan (the creators) do love to tease us.Another thing is that Zuko and Suki join the Gaang, adding another dimension to the show. Having Zuko, who began as an antagonist and ended up as an anti-hero by the start of Book 3, make such a bold statement against his father is one of the highlights of the whole show. It's realistically done, with Katara unwilling to trust him at first and friction within the group as a result. (Suki, meanwhile, slips in without a problem just before the finale, because everyone loves Suki.)Some fans might say that to close out the finale (which is the best finale I've ever seen for any television show, period) with a romantic moment between Aang and Katara was too cliche and went against the tone of the show, but I don't think so. After all, the show began with him waking up in her arms - it's only right and proper that it end with them, the two most important characters, finally coming to terms with the fact that their relationship has changed into to something more.In closing, I will say this: You might think that this is ""a kids' show"" just because it's broadcast on Nickelodeon and is animated.

1165915,AVOCKGHG1NITL,B001AI7766,TeriDactyl,"[2, 2]","I've had a few successes with anime in the past, but have recently followed a whole string of failures, it seems. I just finished watching all of Avatar:The Last Airbender, though, and it is by far my favorite anime series ever. Don't let the fact that it's American-produced anime tarnish your willingness to watch this amazing series, because this show accomplishes a lot where even Asian-produced shows fall flat. Here's a few example how.DEPTH OF CHARACTERS: This is a deal-breaker for any story for me, but this show passes with flying colors. The characters are great right out of the box, but over the course of the series, the writers were able to squeeze a massive amount of development and pathos out of each one without ever getting too heavy or depressing. Also, the relationships that grow between the characters evolve organically and rarely seem forced.SOLID STORYTELLING: The individual episodes are tight. The series as a whole had a pre-determined beginning, middle, and end and was obviously well-planned, so there is little to no dead weight in the storytelling. Each episode serves to enhance the last and move the plot forward. It's refreshing to see a studio project like this not afraid to have a full concept planned going in and not allow themselves to be bullied by execs to stretch out stories unnecessarily with a lot of superfluous plot twists and loose ends just to pick up ratings and beef up their toy line.VISUAL DETAILS: The art is beautiful and I can't say enough about how great it looks. The scenery is spectacular and rich with detail. The artists weren't slavish to character design, either; just as the characters change throughout the series, the artists weren't afraid to change their designs periodically to suit the story's needs. The use of CGI is judicious and tasteful and, while noticeable next to the traditional animation, it isn't distracting.Anyway, I could go on and on, but if you made it this far, why don't you just go and watch it? If you're not hooked after the 3rd episode, you're obviously in a coma.",5,Not (Just) For Kids,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2061,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'few', 'successes', 'anime', 'past', 'have', 'recently', 'followed', 'whole', 'string', 'failures', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Avatar', 'Last', 'Airbender', 'though', 'far', 'favorite', 'anime', 'series', 'ever', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'fact', 'American-produced', 'anime', 'tarnish', 'willingness', 'watch', 'amazing', 'series', 'show', 'lot', 'where', 'even', 'Asian-produced', 'shows', 'fall', 'flat', 'Here', 'few', 'example', 'how.DEPTH', 'CHARACTERS', 'deal-breaker', 'story', 'show', 'flying', 'colors', 'characters', 'are', 'great', 'right', 'box', 'course', 'series', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'squeeze', 'massive', 'amount', 'development', 'pathos', 'one', 'ever', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy', 'depressing', 'Also', 'relationships', 'grow', 'characters', 'evolve', 'organically', 'rarely', 'seem', 'forced.SOLID', 'STORYTELLING', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'tight', 'series', 'whole', 'had', 'pre-determined', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'was', 'obviously', 'well-planned', 'little', 'dead', 'weight', 'storytelling', 'episode', 'enhance', 'last', 'move', 'plot', 'forward', 'refreshing', 'see', 'studio', 'project', 'not', 'afraid', 'have', 'full', 'concept', 'planned', 'going', 'not', 'allow', 'be', 'bullied', 'execs', 'stretch', 'out', 'stories', 'unnecessarily', 'lot', 'superfluous', 'plot', 'twists', 'loose', 'ends', 'just', 'pick', 'up', 'ratings', 'beef', 'up', 'toy', 'line.VISUAL', 'DETAILS', 'art', 'beautiful', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'how', 'great', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'rich', 'detail', 'artists', 'were', ""n't"", 'slavish', 'character', 'design', 'either', 'just', 'characters', 'change', 'series', 'artists', 'were', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'change', 'designs', 'periodically', 'suit', 'story', 'needs', 'use', 'CGI', 'judicious', 'tasteful', 'noticeable', 'next', 'traditional', 'animation', ""n't"", 'distracting.Anyway', 'could', 'go', 'made', 'far', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'watch', ""'re"", 'not', 'hooked', '3rd', 'episode', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'coma']",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection

Animation is so plain and the characters are so believeable that I felt like I was traveling with the group myself.Very colorful and smooth, the animation is one of the best I've seen. Lot's of color and action, with some slow-mo effects. Fight sequences and physics are demonstrated very well. You feel the weight of the rocks thrown at characters or feel the blast effect of ball of flames when exploding.Voice acting is also great. Especially Zuko and Iroh, man, they are amazing, you can feel the conflict in Zuko, or the great wisdom of Iroh. Also dialogues are clever and the jokes are well placed, Toph kills me when she opens her mouth, yip, there is a smile on my face now.Plot is, well, kind of complicated to explain. A series this long bound to have some boring episodes, so, yes, there are some boring episodes.  But as I've said before, I felt like I was travelling with my friends, so there were some fun times and some slow times, just like real life.

Yes it only lasted for a three seasons but not one episode was filling. How many shows last for ten seasons and maintain a strong storyline? Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko did this right. They had a clear ending to the series before jumping in.  So while Lost limps along losing momentum probably ending with a whimper the Avatar went out with a bang. Kudos to all involved in making this one of the best shows ever to grace my T.V.",5,This is what TV should be,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,500,"['Avatar', 'had', 'beginning', 'middle', 'climatic', 'end', 'Yes', 'only', 'lasted', 'three', 'seasons', 'not', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'filling', 'How', 'many', 'shows', 'last', 'ten', 'seasons', 'maintain', 'strong', 'storyline', 'Michael', 'Dante', 'DiMartino', 'Bryan', 'Konietzko', 'did', 'right', 'had', 'clear', 'ending', 'series', 'jumping', 'So', 'Lost', 'limps', 'losing', 'momentum', 'probably', 'ending', 'whimper', 'Avatar', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'Kudos', 'involved', 'making', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'grace', 'T.V']",Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection
