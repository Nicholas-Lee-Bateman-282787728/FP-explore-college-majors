I have tried watching the other half from Noth and Sciorra all the way up to Jeff Goldblum and partner.  Although all others are very talented actors, I have been unable to enjoy them in these roles.  I am totally taken by D'Onofrio and Erbe and the talent they bring to this show.  I will certainly buy the 5th season, but you can bet that I only watch the ones with Goren and Eames.  I am so very sorry that Mr. D'Onofrio is leaving and the heart will go out of the show.  I will probably tune in to the new one but I don't think I will remain a fan.  It would have been interesting to see Goren  andEames' lives play out.  Both Goren and Eames needed a minor theme of a romantic interest to brighten things up.

Barek (Sciorra) , both teams work together in one case in this season and in my opinion is the best joint episode of a series ever.I never saw the original L&O; so I didn't know who Det. Mike Logan was, personally I don't care much in this season because Det. Barek is like Goren's female counterpart and made the episodes interesting. The reason I never watched Logan's episodes again was because the 2 terrible other partners he had (Wheeler & Falacci), Falacci wasn't that bad in season 7 but Wheeler was.This is probably the last good season, mainly because of the departures of Ron Carver (Vance),Capt. Deakins (Sheridan) and Det. Barek (Sciorra) why did they leave? or why did Dick Wolf cutted them out? I think those 3 still had a very good potential, specially Det. Barek.Sadly now L&0 it's just like your average CSI, I think that's why Vic D'Onofrio left the show in season 9.Buy this one, is the last good one.",4,One of the last good ones.,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,1020,"['5th', 'year', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'are', 'introduced', 'team', 'B', 'made', 'Det', 'Logan', 'Noth', 'Det', 'Barek', 'Sciorra', 'teams', 'work', 'together', 'one', 'case', 'season', 'opinion', 'best', 'joint', 'episode', 'series', 'ever.I', 'never', 'saw', 'original', 'L', 'O', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'Det', 'Mike', 'Logan', 'was', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'season', 'Det', 'Barek', 'Goren', 'female', 'counterpart', 'made', 'episodes', 'interesting', 'reason', 'never', 'watched', 'Logan', 'episodes', 'again', 'was', '2', 'terrible', 'other', 'partners', 'had', 'Wheeler', 'Falacci', 'Falacci', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'season', '7', 'Wheeler', 'was.This', 'probably', 'last', 'good', 'season', 'mainly', 'departures', 'Ron', 'Carver', 'Vance', 'Capt', 'Deakins', 'Sheridan', 'Det', 'Barek', 'Sciorra', 'why', 'did', 'leave', 'why', 'did', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'cutted', 'out', 'think', '3', 'still', 'had', 'very', 'good', 'potential', 'specially', 'Det', 'Barek.Sadly', 'now', 'L', '0', 'just', 'average', 'CSI', 'think', 'why', 'Vic', ""D'Onofrio"", 'left', 'show', 'season', '9.Buy', 'one', 'last', 'good', 'one']",N/A

One week you get the usual Goren and Eames and the next week you get a new team.  The new team is Mike Logan (Chris Noth) and Carolyn Barek (Annabella Sciorra). Noth eventually grew on me.  After all, he used to be on the original L&O.;  However, Sciorra was terrible in this role. She was replaced by other women, who also failed, until in 2009 the show just paired Eames with Jeff Goldblum.  Some tv viewers just got in the habit of watching this show only when Goren and Eames were the ones ""up"". Some buyers of the dvd will probably do the same.The formula of the show remains the same.  The two detectives need to solve a case which is particularly gruesome or sensitive. The focus is entirely on solving the case, not winning it in court, which makes it different from the other two L&Os.; The scripts remain top notch.  However, this is a show which never deviates from the L&O; formula.The earliest seasons of L&O; CI are its best ones.
