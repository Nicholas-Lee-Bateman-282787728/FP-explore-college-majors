349087,AAZTMLVDQUHZK,6302985293,"Art Griggs ""TheCritic""","[29, 29]","BOYS NIGHT OUT is finally available remastered on DVD.  The film Pillow Talk has had more said about it and its social reflection then this little gem from the same director.  This is the era when Playboy magazine and ""The Pill"" were becoming major influences on the so-called Sex Revolution in the US.  Boys Night Out is a sex comedy that is very much tied to this time, which in this case quickly dates it but that is true of most comedy.  Next to Pillow Talk, I personally feel Boys Night Out is the better film.  With Boys Night Out we just have more fun - the writing is better, the directing/editing is tighter and the cast is superb.  And what a cast, you can't go wrong with Kim Novak and James Garner and the many supporting actors are Hollywood's best.  Note: The title song's clever lyrics were written by the great Sammy Cahn and sung by cast member Patti Page.  So set your sexual mores back to 1962 and sit back and enjoy this light romp of lust and love.

This is especially apparent with Tony Randall on hand playing an almost identical role to the ones he played in those comedies.  Lots of ""will they tumble into bed when they shouldn't?"" and ""how will the hero actually get the girl?""  questions are  posed, and settled without too much concern for realistic logic by the fadeout.  Sets and colors used are rich and very 60's in design,  and Novak's graduate  school character sports a wardrobe, even Novak might have had trouble affording,  but that is also typical of these films.
