This OAV based on the mannga of the came name about Chicago bounty hunter and gunsmith Rally Vincent and her partner Minnie May Hopkins. With the screenplay and character design by Sononda himself, this has to be my favorite anime in my collection. The story begins when the ATF request that Rally help out to bust a gun runner and this is only the begining of there worries. Next think they know there is an Ex-KGB agent after them. With a great soundtrack and nicely animated this is an all round wonderful tape.",5,Gunsmith Cats: Bulletproof,973209600,"11 3, 2000",2000,584,"['Finally', 'three', 'parts', 'Kenichi', 'Sonda', 'Gunsmith', 'Cats', 'one', 'tape', 'OAV', 'based', 'mannga', 'came', 'name', 'Chicago', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'gunsmith', 'Rally', 'Vincent', 'partner', 'Minnie', 'May', 'Hopkins', 'screenplay', 'character', 'design', 'Sononda', 'be', 'favorite', 'anime', 'collection', 'story', 'when', 'ATF', 'request', 'Rally', 'out', 'bust', 'gun', 'runner', 'only', 'begining', 'worries', 'Next', 'think', 'know', 'Ex-KGB', 'agent', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'nicely', 'animated', 'round', 'wonderful', 'tape']",Gsc: Bulletproof VHS

If you've been a Kenichi Sonada fan  this animated version is a new story that treads the same ground as  the manga. Rally and Minnie May aided by Becky use their wits to elude and  subdue the obvious and not so obvious &quot;bad guys&quot;.  Even if you're  not an anime fan, you'll enjoy it if you forget that you're watching a  cartoon, by the way this isn't for the kiddies!

My favorite thing is if you watch closely, they will drop  little clues as to who these people are.  I didn't pick them up and was  surprised to see how obvious these clues were.One of the best scenes is  when ATF agent, Bill &quot;snake in the grass&quot; Collins tells our duo  to check out the locks on a certain door.  Their reaction is  hilarious.At the time of this review's submission, Amazon shows that  Bulletproof is not available for shipping.  If you can find this anime  somewhere, pick it up.

434864,A1DUIWDZCNJIHA,6304756143,"Slade Simon ""slade37""","[2, 2]","This anime OVA uses characters from the manga of the same name - Gunsmith Cats. This is not based on any existing GSC story. Completely original story and a few new characters.Rally and Minnie May are bounty hunters in Chicago who are blackmailed into helping the ATF. It turns out the girls don't have a license to sell some of the weapons they have in their gun shop plus there's May's handling of explosives. The ATF wants some help in getting a gun smuggler. This leads to a Russian assassin being hired to kill Rally.Although I like this title, it doesn't seem as strong as the manga. There isn't the same character or story development. The humor is good though. You don't have to read the manga to enjoy this, but I do feel the manga has better plots.It's a little tame for a typical GSC story. The manga tends to be more realistic. Rally may pull off incredible stunts in the manga, but it's all believable or at least possible with some luck. Here in the anime, I have problems with the end of the second episode when Minnie May is holding onto Rally's speeding car. When Rally stops after driving at high speeds, May should not have been able to hold on - plus she has no cuts from the broken glass. The rest of the show is OK, and I admit I may just be picky about this. Hey, it's entertainment. How many action movies are truly believable?Trivia Notes: Look at the license plate of the truck at the begining of the second episode - a little Star Trek reference. The plate number is NCC 1701.Also, Amanda Winn Lee who provides the voice for Rally for the dub also does the voice for soft-spoken Rei in Evangelion and Mumiji in Blue Seed.",4,Nice Action Anime,997747200,"08 14, 2001",2001,1648,"['anime', 'OVA', 'characters', 'manga', 'same', 'name', 'Gunsmith', 'Cats', 'not', 'based', 'existing', 'GSC', 'story', 'Completely', 'original', 'story', 'few', 'new', 'characters.Rally', 'Minnie', 'May', 'are', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'Chicago', 'who', 'are', 'blackmailed', 'helping', 'ATF', 'out', 'girls', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'license', 'sell', 'weapons', 'have', 'gun', 'shop', 'May', 'handling', 'explosives', 'ATF', 'help', 'getting', 'gun', 'smuggler', 'Russian', 'assassin', 'being', 'hired', 'kill', 'Rally.Although', 'like', 'title', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'strong', 'manga', ""n't"", 'same', 'character', 'story', 'development', 'humor', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'read', 'manga', 'enjoy', 'do', 'feel', 'manga', 'better', 'plots.It', 'little', 'tame', 'typical', 'GSC', 'story', 'manga', 'be', 'more', 'realistic', 'Rally', 'may', 'pull', 'off', 'incredible', 'stunts', 'manga', 'believable', 'least', 'possible', 'luck', 'Here', 'anime', 'have', 'problems', 'end', 'second', 'episode', 'when', 'Minnie', 'May', 'holding', 'Rally', 'speeding', 'car', 'When', 'Rally', 'driving', 'high', 'speeds', 'May', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'hold', 'cuts', 'broken', 'glass', 'rest', 'show', 'OK', 'admit', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'picky', 'Hey', 'entertainment', 'How', 'many', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'truly', 'believable', 'Trivia', 'Notes', 'Look', 'license', 'plate', 'truck', 'begining', 'second', 'episode', 'little', 'Star', 'Trek', 'reference', 'plate', 'number', 'NCC', '1701.Also', 'Amanda', 'Winn', 'Lee', 'who', 'voice', 'Rally', 'dub', 'also', 'voice', 'soft-spoken', 'Rei', 'Evangelion', 'Mumiji', 'Blue', 'Seed']",Gsc: Bulletproof VHS

The addition of the BAT agent  foil was a nice touch, and the villains were dead on for the genre.I was  very disappointed in the drop of quality in animation in the third and  final episode included on the tape. If the quality had remained consistent  throughout, this would have been a Four Star effort.Nonetheless, I think  I can recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys &quot;Gunsmith  Cats&quot; or buddy flicks.",3,"Captured the essence of the comic book nicely, but...",945648000,"12 20, 1999",1999,611,"['enjoyed', 'video', 'very', 'much', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'better', 'average', 'have', 'English', 'language', 'version', 'quot', 'flick', 'quot', 'storyline', 'moved', 'along', 'excellent', 'pace', 'addition', 'BAT', 'agent', 'foil', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'villains', 'were', 'dead', 'genre.I', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'drop', 'quality', 'animation', 'third', 'final', 'episode', 'included', 'tape', 'quality', 'had', 'remained', 'consistent', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Four', 'Star', 'effort.Nonetheless', 'think', 'can', 'recommend', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'quot', 'Gunsmith', 'Cats', 'quot', 'buddy', 'flicks']",Gsc: Bulletproof VHS
