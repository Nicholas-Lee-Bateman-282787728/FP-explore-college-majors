But I like it too much to give it less. It's an  over-the-top film with a subtley surreal quality (the story is too  far-fetched to be credible, but too well done to be dismissed in its given  context), and a solid sense of character development. Film builds in  adventure and emotion into a truly entertaing, gripping, and  heart-wrenching climax.

The ways he takes people out or finds ways to get to them are amazing.  Natalie Portman is also in this movie and she plays her role great too.  She is a 12 year old girl who's life is bad and her parents are killed by DEA Agents.  Leon takes her under his wing and she fills the emptiness in his life while he trains her to be a cleaner. The plot summary I gave doesn't do it justice, its much more indepth than what I said. This movie is filled with explosive action, drama, and suspense.  Once you see this movie you will want to see it a hundred times over.  Leon is one of my favorite movies and I'm telling you it really blows away alot of other ""action"" movies.  There is a reason why this movie is an international hit, so stop reading this review and just buy the movie.  Make sure you buy the international edition.

Little Miss Portman handled herself very well in this role even, at one point, handling and stripping down a pistol in a very natural practiced manner. &#34;Cop&#34; Oldman was good at his role too,his character finally getting what he deserved, costing Reno his life in the process(Jean Reno was also good as the killer who reluctantly took a little girl in and came to love her as if she were his own daughter.).I don't think I've seen the U.S. &#34;cut&#34; so I'm not sure of the differences but for me the movie version as I remember it had a weak ending with Portman going off to boarding school, paid for out of Reno's money by mob banker Danny Aiello.

5633,AJQV1GCU92BUY,0767802519,Acacia Manning,"[1, 3]","The Professional is an interesting movie. It's gritty, oddly matched characters and colors present something...odd. Leon is lovable...he is sexy and kind and hilarious, while still retaining the sadness that is due him, anywhere from watching Gene Kelly with ardour to his sleeping habits. Gary Oldman is a little over the top, but he's still good and creepy, while being a believable drug addict. Natalie Portman is a brat...her swearing was annoying, her dressing ridiculously provocative at points, her attitude unbearable, and her penchant for Jean Reno, or Leon, extremely creepy sometimes (such as wearing his underwear to bed, telling the hotel manager that Leon was her lover, and telling him she was falling in love with him while they zoomed in on her stomach). The storyline was good, and thankfully they kept Leon refreshingly not-turned-on by her attempts to be close to him. It stays platonic enough to be enjoyable at parts, but Mathilda (Natalie Portman) was over the top and pervertedly provocative, such as dancing in a bra and thong-over-tights while singing ""You Make Me Feel Like a Virgin"" to Leon. Thankfully Leon is just respectable and kind.The storyline is sad, such as Leon worked for years and years killing while being used by his ""friend"" Tony, then Mathilda being denied the money Leon desired her to have. The ending was extremely sad, but thankfully one gets the impression Mathilda will become better later in life.In Ronin, it is pointed out during director commentary how hard it is and what a beautiful thing it is to make a set look lived in or old and cruddy. They achieve this grittiness to perfection in The Professional, with all the different apartments Mathilda forces them to move in to. The clothes, unfortunately, excepting Leons, seem to hark back to mid-80s rather than mid-90s.Jean Reno was absolutely fantastic, lovable, and sympathetic as a man learning to live again, while still being able to kill. He's smart, he just seems to have turned off his human side too long. Gary Oldman is creepy, a little over the top, but hateful in the good way while having his own almost endearing nuances. Mathilda is extremely annoying and creepy, but after watching it twice she did not bug me as much as the first time. She's extremely believable in her idiocy.It was a good movie, Jean Reno was fantastic, however it is not a feel good movie, nor does it have crazy fighting sequences, though the ones they do have are good.

A movie about a 40 something Italian hitman that falls in love with a 12 year old girl.  But it is much more than the parts that make it a movie.First off the bat it ignores a lot of stereotypes that existed at that time about hitmen, especially Italian ones that worked for a face that is played up to be part of La Cost Nostra, even it if isn't said outright.  He doesnt' wear Armani Suits, eat spaghetti, sleep with high class floozies, or hang out at bars bragging about who he has done in all while drinking shots and snorting coke.  No, he is a quiet introvert, that does his job, and meticulously focuses on his quiet and simple life.  He is illiterate, has only one real friend, cares for his plant like it was a pet, and loves going out to musicals.  Which, the latter is a great scene, seeing a hardened killer smiling like he was a 10 year old boy while watching muscials at a nearly empty theater was classic.  Plus the more you get to know of his character the more you realize he is stunted emotionally, flawless killer, but unable to handle simple social interaction.Natalie Portman shows her talent in her first role as the rebellious daughter of a drug handler.  She shows not only her potential for being a great actress, but intelligence in this role.  Where she falls in love with a hitman and is dead set on avenging the death of her little brother, the one person in her dysfunctional family she cares for.Gary Oldman is in his classic evil form as a drug addicted DEA agent that has crossed the line.  True, he does overdo the character, but that is what makes it fun.  Watching him pop some green pill, chatter about Bethoven, then procede to break into an apartment killing everyone in it was one of the best parts of the film.The camera angles and the characters in this movie are fresh and gritty.  Not falling to sterotypes, they make you feel like you are really in New York, sweating along with the cop in a bad suit and five o'clock shadow.The love story is bizarre, but works in the end.  Two misfits, that find each other and help pull themselves out of their downward spiraling lives.This is a powerful movie that I think everyone should experience.  It hits on many levels and appeals to many different types of people, people who like to view films as artwork to those who just like an action flick, this movie will deliver.  Though I was tempted to take away a star since I didn't like the additions of the directors cut, the power still holds.  See the theatrical release first, then watch the directors cut.

While elements of this film don't work entirely (parts feel redundant or uninspired, and Oldman is way too over-the-top), there is no denying that the film as a whole is intriguing and completely entertaining.  The handling of the storyline, and the beautiful relationship development that spawns between Leon and Mathilda help elevate the film from a mere action flick and give it life.The story that develops here follows a hired hitman named Leon who takes a young newly orphaned girl under his wing when her family is murdered by a dirty cop (really dirty).  This young girl, 12 year-old Mathilda, isn't content with moving on from the tragedy of her life in the arms of this rugged hitman; she wants revenge, and revenge she will get.Natalie Portman, who has definitely made the most of her career as of recently, is astonishingly good here.  She pulls out such savage emotions at such a young age and really establishes her talent, regardless of how I personally feel her career `stumbled' in her early adulthood.  Jean Reno tends to play the same character in every film (or at least a variation of that character) and he does that here too, but with a quiet sincerity that draws you to him.  Gary Oldman is the only sore spot for me, manic and just `too much', but he doesn't distract too much from the film itself.With intense direction and editing that spills over into every frame, `Leon: The Professional' hits a lot of the right marks and earns the nice reputation it has as a cult classic of the genre.

5645,AUEYE7V7RYBD6,0767802519,Anthony Clarke,"[3, 3]","`The Professional' is Luc Besson's finest film, greater even than `La femme Nikita'. It is violent, yet subtle and complex as it traces the tortuous yet trusting relationship between Jean Reno's character of the  introverted misanthropic hitman Leon, and the 12-year-old girl he is forced  to adopt and care for, played brilliantly by the beautiful Natalie Portman.  This would be enough by itself, but as a bonus we get Gary Oldman's  performance as the corrupt New York cop: it's a minor miracle of  characterisation.Jean Reno's character Leon embeds itself in the  viewer's psyche - he plays the role with formidable gravitas and with an  underlying pathos. But if the film is dominated by anyone, it is by its  young star Natalie Portman, street-wise beyond her years, at once both  tough and seductive; the ultimate New York Lolita.

5646,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0767802519,Anthony Hinde,"[4, 6]","Early in Luc Besson's film, ""Leon"" (aka The Professional), we learn that only master assassins work up close, with their hands or a knife. If that's true then Besson must consider himself a master director as this movie takes the audience up close and personal with some fascinating but ultimately doomed characters.If it seems the title role was written for Jean Reno, that's only because it was. He plays an Italian hit-man who works in New York. Like many immigrants, he is isolated within the new and unfamiliar world. He shares a squalid little apartment with one plant and leaves only to buy provisions, visit his friend, (and manager), Tony, and occasionally see an old movie at the local cinema. His life would be small and insignificant if it weren't for the fact that he is a ruthless killer, working for the Mob.The genius of this film is that it somehow convinces the audience to feel sympathy towards a brutal assassin. This ""Professional"" is portrayed as somehow fragile while at the same time being perfectly dangerous. He can't read English, doesn't speak much and is clearly being short-changed by Tony, a slick Italian ""Family"" man played gently by Danny Aiello. When trouble visits Leon's little unit block, he doesn't venture out but prefers to watch from the safety of his door's spy-hole.This particular trouble comes in the form of detective Norman Stansfield, a crooked cop who arrives to visit one of his drug couriers who stupidly gambles his life in an effort to increase his slice of the business. Stansfield, played brilliantly by Gary Oldmam, is a pill-popping psychotic whose only redeeming feature seems to be a love of classical music. Sadly he sees parallels between famous concertos and savage gun battles. In this case, his shotgun version of Beethoven leaves the entire family dead in their apartment; all but 12-year-old Mathilda.Natalie Portman's first major cinematic role, as Mathilda, is impressive. She has to project a broad range for a child character. After growing up as a drug dealer's daughter and then losing even that small security, she is both vulnerable and street smart. And, after convincing Leon to take her in, she also starts to explore her budding sexuality, (a foreshadowing of her role in Beautiful Women).In our politically correct world, 12-year-old girls are not meant to be sexually attractive but that doesn't stop Besson from designing scenes where young Mathilda makes serious attempts to seduce the shy Leon. It's unclear whether she truly feels love or is simply trying to ensure her new place in the world. The result is a strong bond between the two unlikely companions, more familial than sexual. In the end, it is this bond that forces Leon to abandon his years of caution.This is a film that combines a perfect cast with inspired direction, European cinematography and the characteristic score of Eric Serra to create a powerful, sometimes disturbing, experience that will stay with you for years to come.",5,An injection of life into a killer's cold heart.,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,2981,"['Early', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'film', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'learn', 'only', 'master', 'assassins', 'work', 'up', 'close', 'hands', 'knife', 'true', 'then', 'Besson', 'must', 'consider', 'master', 'director', 'movie', 'audience', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'fascinating', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'characters.If', 'title', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'only', 'was', 'Italian', 'hit-man', 'who', 'New', 'York', 'many', 'immigrants', 'isolated', 'new', 'unfamiliar', 'world', 'shares', 'squalid', 'little', 'apartment', 'one', 'plant', 'only', 'buy', 'provisions', 'visit', 'friend', 'manager', 'Tony', 'occasionally', 'see', 'old', 'movie', 'local', 'cinema', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'small', 'insignificant', 'were', ""n't"", 'fact', 'ruthless', 'killer', 'working', 'Mob.The', 'genius', 'film', 'audience', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'towards', 'brutal', 'assassin', 'Professional', 'portrayed', 'somehow', 'fragile', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'perfectly', 'dangerous', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'English', ""n't"", 'speak', 'much', 'clearly', 'being', 'short-changed', 'Tony', 'slick', 'Italian', 'Family', 'man', 'played', 'gently', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'When', 'trouble', 'Leon', 'little', 'unit', 'block', ""n't"", 'venture', 'out', 'prefers', 'watch', 'safety', 'door', 'spy-hole.This', 'particular', 'trouble', 'form', 'detective', 'Norman', 'Stansfield', 'crooked', 'cop', 'who', 'visit', 'one', 'drug', 'couriers', 'who', 'stupidly', 'life', 'effort', 'increase', 'slice', 'business', 'Stansfield', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Gary', 'Oldmam', 'pill-popping', 'psychotic', 'only', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'be', 'love', 'classical', 'music', 'Sadly', 'parallels', 'famous', 'concertos', 'savage', 'gun', 'battles', 'case', 'shotgun', 'version', 'Beethoven', 'entire', 'family', 'dead', 'apartment', '12-year-old', 'Mathilda.Natalie', 'Portman', 'first', 'major', 'cinematic', 'role', 'Mathilda', 'impressive', 'project', 'broad', 'range', 'child', 'character', 'growing', 'up', 'drug', 'dealer', 'daughter', 'then', 'losing', 'even', 'small', 'security', 'vulnerable', 'street', 'smart', 'convincing', 'Leon', 'take', 'also', 'explore', 'budding', 'sexuality', 'foreshadowing', 'role', 'Beautiful', 'Women', 'politically', 'correct', 'world', '12-year-old', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'sexually', 'attractive', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Besson', 'designing', 'scenes', 'where', 'young', 'Mathilda', 'serious', 'attempts', 'seduce', 'shy', 'Leon', 'unclear', 'truly', 'feels', 'love', 'simply', 'trying', 'ensure', 'new', 'place', 'world', 'result', 'strong', 'bond', 'two', 'unlikely', 'companions', 'more', 'familial', 'sexual', 'end', 'bond', 'Leon', 'abandon', 'years', 'caution.This', 'film', 'perfect', 'cast', 'inspired', 'direction', 'European', 'cinematography', 'characteristic', 'score', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'create', 'powerful', 'sometimes', 'disturbing', 'experience', 'will', 'stay', 'years', 'come']",N/A

However, his expertise is soon going to put to a different use. When his 12 year old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her film debut) witnesses her family get murdered by a crooked Fed named Stansfield (the amazing Gary Oldman) and his crew, Leon takes her in and poses as her father. Heartbroken over the death of her 4 year old brother, Mathilda coerces Leon into teaching her how to become a hitman. Reluctantly, Leon agrees, and in return Mathida teaches him to become a compassionate, loving and caring person. The tow form a bond, one that almost becomes something more.When Mathilda takes matters into her own hand, Leon now has to be more alert than ever in order to see Stansfield doesn't get to her first.

5652,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,0767802519,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[12, 14]","French filmmaker Luc Besson's film about a young pubescent girl and her neighbor who happens to be a ""cleaner"" (another name for assassin) is not just an action-film of operatic proportion, but also a poignant story of friendship and love. Leon works well as both and would probably be relegated to a run-of-the-mill actioneer if it lost that humanity.Luc Besson's casting of Natalie Portman as the Lolita-esque Matilda is perfect. I can't pciture this young girl character being played by anyone else. Ms. Portman was still 12 or 13 when she made this film, but she comes across very mature and sure of herself as an actress. What is even more surprising is that Leon is her very first work. Jean Reno as the title character is also a great choice. He is both physically-imposing in a lean and hungry way rather than hulking like Schwarzenneger or Stallone. His character is interesting in that he is almost perfect as an assassin, but very immature socially and almost child-like outside his profession. In the pairing of Matilda and Leon, it is Matilda who comes off as the adult of the pair. The one who ends up showing Leon what the world has to offer outside his profession as a hired killer.The scenes where Matilda and Leon interact are both raw and powerful. There is a certain taboo feeling to seeing a young pubescent girl getting so close to an older man and Besson doesn't push away from it. He hints that there may be something more between these two interesting characters, but he leaves it to the viewer's own imagination to decide if there is.Outside of these two greats actors, the other cast member who almost steals the entire film is Gary Oldman as the corrupt drug enforcement cop Stansfield. Oldman's portrayal of this law enforcement agent ""gone native"" -- so to speak -- is one reason to watch Leon. Oldman straddles the line between mad-genius and caricature. His talent pretty much keeps him on the former instead of the latter. Stansfield has to rank up there as one of the better villains ever put on film. Without Oldman's character there would be no venegeance-fueled motivations for Matilda and certainly no paternal feelings of protection from Leon concerning her.The action sequences owes alot to the ballet-style of gunfights made popular by the Hong Kong films of John Woo. Besson's looks abit more grittier and harsher than Woo's style, but Besson still keeps the sequences very operatic. The fact that Besson has admitted to being a huge fan of John Woo and his work makes it easier to see the influences.This uncut international version of the film is the definitive dvd edition to buy. The extra 20 or so minutes of re-edited scenes really explains more of the dynamic relationship between Matilda and Leon. These extra scenes give the climactic finale more of an emotional impact than the U.S. theatrical version. The video and audio have been totally remastered and it shows when shown on a nice home theater system setup. The Superbit Edition even goes further but sacrifices all the supplemental features to do so.

5656,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,0767802519,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]","THERE ARE NO SPOILERS WITHlN!I love this movie.  I mean, I really love this movie.There are so many things to like: Jean Reno's solemn, restrained performance as professional hitman Leon; 13-year-old Natalie Portman's sweet, affecting acting turn in her first full-length movie role; Gary Oldman's over-the-cliff portrayal of a corrupt and certifiably insane NY city detective.I loved it in the theaters, and came to think it was the only version of the movie.  It was only later that I realized a fuller international version had fleshed out the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (Portman), but they'd been worried that American audiences--though totally comfortable with the violent murder of a drug dealer's family--might quake at scenes that hinted at an intimacy between the very young Portman and the older Leon, even though the film made it clear that nothing did indeed occur between them.  This version re-places those scenes, and their inclusion makes for a better movie...a feat I hadn't thought possible.The plot details I'm including are not spoilers, as they can be found on the back of the box.  A young girl narrowly escapes the murder of her family by a corrupt cop angered by their cheating him on the drugs they kept for him.  Taken in by a hitman who has quite necessarily lived on his own his entire life, Mathilda slowly begins to win him over, and as he begins to teach her his profession her need to exact revenge upon the man who killed her family leads the two into dangerous territory, and their survival is dependent upon whether a psychotic cop can get to the girl, or a professional assassin can protect her.It's not just that a switcheroo has occurred--the deadly protecting the innocent against the lawman--but a whole reassessment of life.  Is it possible to change an aging predator for whom the closest thing to a relationship is--no lie--his care of a potted plant?The director and writer of this wonderful film is Luc Besson, known for his excellent absurdist sci-fi movie ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) as well as his clever, exciting ""La Femme Nikita,"" (1990)--later remade in this country as ""Point of No Return"" with Bridget Fonda.But it's the acting that drives this movie.  Reno is exceptional as the methodical killer (he prefers ""cleaner"")...his puppy dog eyes are perfect here.  Sad, affecting, wise--there is so much that hides behind his lined, unshaven appearance.  And Portman, the ing&eacute;nue, making her debut in this role, is is clearly a talent, hinting at the career to come.Yet the pivotal portrayal here might be Oldman's, a maniacal roller coaster of a man whose demonic character not only provides the tension, but nicely offsets the restraint in the main roles.  There are a few talented actors who can be called upon to portray a wild, frenzied malevolence without calling so much attention to themselves that they monopolize the film, and Oldman is perfect here as the corrupt, despicable cop who has no problem targeting a small child for extinction.See this terrific movie.

5664,AOYLL7W4KQ1AQ,0767802519,cascadegorge,"[1, 2]","I have come to believe that no matter how poor the script, or how small the part, If Jean Reno is in the film, the thing's worth watching. Of all the Reno/Besson films, this is the only one I've seen where Reno is TRULY allowed to display the astonishing depths of his tallent and ability. As the character Leon, he granted the space and time to show the world that HE is this generation's MOST phenominally able performer. With the exception some absurd & unsubtle ""overacting"" by the performer who played the main ""villian""- all the supporting performances are superb. They team up with Monsieur Reno to make an already amazing story & script into an undisputible masterpiece of filmaking.I heartily wish that Reno would make more American films, and with equal earnestness, I wish he would look to directors other than Luc Besson. Frankly, talent wise, Reno is WAY out of Besson's league; a fact that is painfully obvious in most of Jean Reno's Besson directed films.

Not only was the US version good, the &quot;version Integrale&quot; Full Version of the movie is even  better.  The movie was cut to appease the MPAA not because it is brutal, or  because it showed blood, because it showed Natalie Portman:1. Drinking  Champaign2. Going on hits (she does not kill anyone)3. Foolishly  trying to seduce Leon.4. Sleeping in the same bed with Leon (fully  clothed).Silliness aside, this is a SERIOUS movie.  About a  &quot;cleaner&quot; played by Jean Reno (from a character concept taken  from &quot;La Femme Nikita) who is in bondage from a local mob guy.  He  goes on all the dangerous hits and this has detached Leon from normal  society.  He also has the guilt of his ex-girlfriend on his shoulders.  The  introduction of Mathilda to his life uproots and disturbs him.  However, it  also forces Leon to become human again.  It is facinating to see him regain  his humanity.When the DEA kills the family next door, Mathilda is  rescued by Leon and becomes partners.  Natalie Portman makes her screen  debut and it is a powerhouse.  She takes a real risk playing the street  tough Mathilda because she is a bad@ss, yet on the verge of becoming a  sexual woman.  Many youths would have screwed up this role majorly, but  Portman handles it like a 10 year veteran (she was only 12-13 when doing  this movie, reminding me of another youth who took a risk in a movie when  she was that age...Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver).  Gary Oldman is the over  the top DEA Agent, Stansfield.  He takes this role with real  relish.While this movie looks and feels French, that is not a problem.  It is a cool movie, and the relationship between the detached simpleton  Leon and Mathilda is magnetic.  I felt real sorry when Leon lets Mathilda  go to save her life at the end of the movie.  I recommend this movie to  action movie lovers and even those who have to watch movies with this  person...Rating A-",5,This is almost like a new movie.,964915200,"07 30, 2000",2000,2041,"['admit', 'am', 'Professional', 'junkie', 'got', 'copy', 'bootleg', 'VHS', 'tape', 'Japanese', 'Laser', 'have', 'worn', 'out', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'US', 'version', 'good', 'quot', 'version', 'Integrale', 'quot', 'Full', 'Version', 'movie', 'even', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'cut', 'appease', 'MPAA', 'not', 'brutal', 'showed', 'blood', 'showed', 'Natalie', 'Portman:1', 'Drinking', 'Champaign2', 'Going', 'hits', 'not', 'kill', 'anyone', '3', 'Foolishly', 'trying', 'seduce', 'Leon.4', 'Sleeping', 'same', 'bed', 'Leon', 'fully', 'clothed', '.Silliness', 'aside', 'SERIOUS', 'movie', 'quot', 'cleaner', 'quot', 'played', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'character', 'concept', 'taken', 'quot', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'who', 'bondage', 'local', 'mob', 'guy', 'dangerous', 'hits', 'detached', 'Leon', 'normal', 'society', 'also', 'guilt', 'ex-girlfriend', 'shoulders', 'introduction', 'Mathilda', 'life', 'uproots', 'However', 'also', 'Leon', 'become', 'human', 'again', 'facinating', 'see', 'regain', 'humanity.When', 'DEA', 'family', 'next', 'door', 'Mathilda', 'rescued', 'Leon', 'partners', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'screen', 'debut', 'powerhouse', 'real', 'risk', 'playing', 'street', 'tough', 'Mathilda', 'bad', '@', 'ss', 'yet', 'verge', 'becoming', 'sexual', 'woman', 'Many', 'youths', 'would', 'have', 'screwed', 'up', 'role', 'majorly', 'Portman', '10', 'year', 'veteran', 'was', 'only', '12-13', 'when', 'doing', 'movie', 'reminding', 'youth', 'who', 'took', 'risk', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'top', 'DEA', 'Agent', 'Stansfield', 'role', 'real', 'relish.While', 'movie', 'feels', 'French', 'not', 'problem', 'cool', 'movie', 'relationship', 'detached', 'simpleton', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'magnetic', 'felt', 'real', 'sorry', 'when', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'go', 'save', 'life', 'end', 'movie', 'recommend', 'movie', 'action', 'movie', 'lovers', 'even', 'who', 'have', 'watch', 'movies', 'person', 'Rating', 'A-']",N/A
5667,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,0767802519,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[8, 9]","The Professional (U.S. Title) is about a lonely mob assassin, Leon, befriending a 12 year-old girl, Mathilda, whose entire family is murdered because her father ripped off drug dealers.  The murders take place just outside Leon's apartment door.  As Mathilda comes back from grocery shopping she sees the carnage and knocks on Leon's door, who reluctantly let's her in and saves her life. The movie portrays a very unique and sweet relationship between Mathilda and Leon.  Mathilda falls in the love (or is it a crush) with the middle-aged loner assassin which has overt sexual overtones.  Leon loves Mathilda too, but more in a big brother or fatherly fashion.  The interplay between the two as Leon reluctantly takes Mathilda under his wing and teaches her to be an assassin is what makes the movie riveting.  Unfortunately, Mathilda's insistence on going after the man who killed her four year-old brother (she didn't have much use for the rest of her family) puts them both in danger.  The ringleader of this crew is an agent for the Drug Enforcement Agency played brilliantly by Gary Oldham.  The screenplay is quite intricate and the acting superb, making it difficult to justice to the movie in a short review.The uncut version of Leon is far superior to the original movie, although the original is extremely good too.  The extra footage makes the movie a little slower from an action standpoint but is much richer and rewarding.  The uncut version expands on the unique relationship between Leon and Mathilda and gives the viewer a greater understanding and empathy for the characters.The acting is just simply outstanding, but especially by Natalie Portman playing Mathilda, in what had to be a very demanding role.The special features on this DVD are nothing.  It's only trailers and actor profiles.

Superiority, outstanding acting, impeccable soundtrack, and &lt;&lt;un cot&eacute; bougant&gt;&gt; spring to mind. Luc Besson hasn't put a foot wrong to date, and this represents the pinnacle of his unblemished career.The principle is highly original: the &quot;best assassin in town&quot; - an Italian by the name of L&eacute;on (Jean Reno)- who is highly set in his routine of training and care enconters one day an arguement outside his shady appartment door: a pathetic drug horder and his dysfunctional family being threatened at the hands of a seriously weird and viciously corrupt D.E.A. officer (Gary Oldman), who has no qualms in killing anyone who stands in his way, or for that matter slightly annoys him. Under the pressure of all this, and repeatedly abused by her family, 12 year Mathilda (outstandingly portrayed by Natalie Portman of Star Wars fame) comes home from shopping one day to find blood and armed thugs coming out of her appartment - her entire family having been ruthlessly gunned down by Stansfield (Oldman).In an attempt to conceal her real identity she begs for Leon to open his door to her. When he does, the most incredible tale begins - Mathilda begs him to train her in his dark art, but along side all this are normal interests 12 year girls have (watching cartoons, dressing up as film stars and so on), giving the viewer a bizarre sense that there's nothing wrong with their &quot;profession.&quot; Initially reluctant, Leon eventually gives, and gives Mathilda the love she could never have had at home.The remainder of this mind-blower revolves around Mathilda's intent on taking out Stansfield, purely for the murder of her baby brother. All the while, Leon remains the Professional, protecting Mathilda from anyone and everyone, whilst their bond grows.As per Besson film, there are a lot of morals, ideas and very penetrating thoughts to be had here - the action quietly switches from Leon's cold, amoral assassin to water-fights in his appartment with Mathilda. The sheer scope of ideas in this film is incredible, and, without question, the thing that makes it work so well is the photography. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of THOSE films where the camera angle is perfectly cast given the temperament of the movie. Yes, I'm afraid this is one helluva flick.I can't pin down in a brief review what makes this film so god damn good - it's possible to write an encyclopaedia on what makes this one work. The casting is so good its annoying; the soundtrack by Sting, Billy Joel and Eric Clapton is very moving and well used (when Leon is walking towards his light at the end of his tunnel - I don't want to spoilt the VERY dramatic ending - the careful use of the music is admirable). I can watch the &quot;fat guy&quot; opening over and over, and the film is never in the slightest bit slow, despite there being so many personal bits in it.So, you have your orders, people.

The movie is not a typical action movie.  The plot develops far better than average, the cast develops the roles far better, and the directing is first rate.  very much along the same lines as La Femme Nikita, also by Besson with a smaller role by Reno, the movie is moved along by its story, not by the explosions and the action on the screen.

I've watched it many times and bought severarl versions, the last being this one.It's a very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; There are tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. The little girl Natalie Portman, as ""Mathilda,"" does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child.  It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star.  Despite his profession, ""Leon"" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. Also, there is a very satisfying ending;  Finally, I like the reat camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.The bad messages?  Well, not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but  (on this deluxe extended version) she gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her. Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) Finally, we see another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys.

The massacre occurs near the beginning of the  movie.  Mathilda, the girl, walks by as her father, step-mother, sister and  4 year old brother are killed by the bad guys (corrupt DEA agents).  To  save herself, Mathilda knocks on her neighbor's door.  Her neighbor, a  hitman and the &quot;good guy&quot; in this movie, opens the door and gets  stuck with her.Mathilda convinces the hitman to train her so she can  avenge the death of her four-year-old brother.  She makes it a point that  she didn't really care about the rest of her victimized family.  The movie  goes on to show Mathilda practicing to be a hit-person (hitting a bulls-eye  on the first practice shot) and even pretending to be a delivery girl to  successfully get into the DEA.  The unbelievability of scenes like these  are the principal weakness of this movie, along with some of the silly  dialogue.However, the movie also has its strengths including great  performances by the lead characters, and the brilliant direction of the  action sequences.Unfortunately, I disagree with most reviewers as to  the portrayal of the relationship between the hit-man and Mathilda.  There  are some innuendos that are quite disturbing.  For example, while they are  at a hotel, the receptionist refers to the hitman as her father.  Mathilda  corrects him and says, &quot;He is not my father; he is my lover.&quot;  In  another scene,  Mathilda comes out dressed as Madonna (make-up and  underclothes exposed)to amuse the hitman.

5692,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,0767802519,Dave,"[0, 1]","""Fantastic Acting, Wonderful Story, Great Photography and Exciting, Unusual and Original Music Score"" would have been my review title if there was enough room. I will not repeat the story line because so many others have done so. The story is carried by the three main actors: Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, each of whom could have earned an Oscar for their acting in this film. Their characters are larger than life and each is a contradiction in themselves. Reno is a skilled professional hit man but can have childlike innocence. Oldman is a top DEA agent and a truly evil drug addict/dealer who loves Beethoven. Portman is a child with much innocence having been taken from her by her mother and father and the life style to which they exposed her. Oldman also robbed her of much innocence early in the film.  The tension and attraction among the three, which is enhanced by their personal contradictions, is the meat of the screenplay that these great actors take advantage of which makes this film so absolutely special. I have yet to see any other film that completely engrosses me in the same way. There is a good bit of violence, but each of the main characters is violent in their own way and accordingly, it does not seem gratuitous.  Also driving the violence is the significant drug presence surrounding Oldman's character and his subordinates as well as the violence inherent to Reno's profession. All of this is packed into less than two hours of intensity with little break.

Short of BluRay, I thought this ""high-end"" DVD might be a good way to check out my new set. When I ran the disc I was pleased to find that it loaded and played perfectly.

I have found that most of my DVD's have to be manually set for screen size and my TV's settings either underfill or overfill the screen, a software issue I believe.This disc worked perfectly except for one grievous defect, NO sound! I concluded that Amazon's warning about Superbit disc issues was well founded. I tried the disc in a second player and found that when I changed the sound setting, the disc's sound plays perfectly. The disc says that it is DTS (whatever that is), yet it was when I changed my sound setting from DTS to Dolby stereo, that the disc's sound appeared. I will diagram it for greater clarity. Perhaps I can save the next customer a bit of frustration. ( SOUND SETTING: DTS > Dolby 5.1 ) This worked.I have yet to watch the entire disc, having received it in the mail only a couple of hours ago.

5700,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,0767802519,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[30, 33]","Hot after his film ""La Femme Nikita"", in 1994 Luc Besson (""The Fifth Element"", ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", writer of ""The Transporter"" films) would go on to work on his film ""Leon"" (Leon the Professional).  The film was written and directed by Besson and featured music by Eric Serra (""The Fifth Element"", ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"", ""GoldenEye"") and cinematography by Thierry Arbogast (""Babylon AD"", ""Femme Fatale"", ""Kiss of the Dragon"", ""The Messanger: The Story of Joan of Arc).The film would reunite Besson with popular French action star Jean Reno (Mission: Impossible"", ""Ronin"", ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""The Pink Panther"") who he worked on in ""Nikita"" and ""Le grand bleu"" and would be the first major film for 12-year-old actress at the time, Natalie Portman (""Star Wars: Episodes I-III"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Paris, je `taime"").  For the most part, the film received mostly positive critic reviews but also some controversy as the film would feature an older man raising a young girl and teaching her how the life of a hitman.  Let alone, a 12-year-old who is attracted to an older man.""Leon the Professional"" had an original theatrical release but there was an extended version (or Director's Cut) featuring an extra 24-minutes of footage which focuses on Leon training Mathilda but also the emotional connection the two have for each other.  Both are included on the Blu-ray release and personally, I prefer the extended version as the screenplay focuses a lot on the friendship between Leon and Mathilda.VIDEO & AUDIO:When I first saw ""Leon the Professional"", I admit that I was happy.  Why?  Many films created between 1986-1996 and released on Blu-ray, some really look their age, transfer is not all that great or is very soft but for ""Leon the Professional"", the colors are vibrant, blacks are nice and deep and detail can be seen.  The old  buildings that Leon and Mathilda live in, you can see all the cracks and how old they look.  It just seems much more clearer.  Sharpness is great and the colors just pop. There is a nice amount of grain as well and no softness.  This doesn't look like a film that is 15-years-old.  So, needless to say...picture quality is fantastic.Audio quality is equally impressive.  Featured in 5.1 DTS-HD MA (in English, French and Portuguese), there are really good action sequences and gun fights that really utilize the soundscape from the front, center and surround channels.  Especially during the final confrontation, the film sounds great.  Music by Eric Serra also helps create the mood.  For the most part, this is not an action film that is overly aggressive as most of the film is dialogue-based between Leon and Mathilda but for the most part, when the action scenes do happen, you'll definitely hear those gun shots, machine gun rattling, explosions really clear.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Leon the Professional"" on Blu-ray comes with the following special features:# 10 Year Retrospective: Cast and Crew Look Back - (25:09) A featurette released on the 2004 DVD.  A virtual reunion with interviews with the cast talking about a film they made 10 years ago.  How the film came to be made and how the talent were cast for the film.# Jean Reno: The Road to Leon - (12:25) A featurette about Jean Reno, his personal life of him growing up and his previous works that led to him playing the character of Leon.# Natalie Portman: Starting Young - (13:49) Natalie Portman talks about reading the script at 11-years-old and wanting to do the part despite her parents feeling it was inappropriate.  Working with Jean Reno and Luc Besson and how she was able to accomplish those emotional crying scenes and more.# Fact Track - Viewers can watch the extended version of the film with a fact track.JUDGMENT CALL:""Leon the Professional"" is a riveting, action-packed film.  And for those who are familiar with Luc Besson films, you expect intense gunfighting sequences and plenty of destruction.  Granted, he has done a lot more of that now with recent films but back in 1994, ""Leon the Professional"" was entertaining then and 15-years later, continues to be quite entertaining now.Jean Reno is really good playing those action, hitman type of scenes.  He's a tough guy but Luc Besson knows how to utilize his character quite well in his films.  Gary Oldman is always a fantastic villain and his character Stansfield is just repulsive.  Murdering young children definitely made the viewer want either Leon or Mathilda to really get their revenge on him by the end of the film.  And the way it played out, was well-done.  But as Reno and Oldman were fantastic, Natalie Portman was incredible. The actress demonstrated in this film that she can be an actress that can excel in emotional scenes and for the most part, back in 1994, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that she would grow up to be an actress to watch for.  Overall, great acting by the three main characters of the film.As for the controversy which led the film to be cut for its theatrical version, I can understand where opposition groups were coming from.  Mathilda was a child that was raised in a dysfunctional setting and she has been emotionally damaged that the only person that she sees as her savior was Leon.  A man who lives in isolation and his best friend is a plant.  But of course, there is a sense of sadness that broods with the character of Leon and somehow, these two find comfort within each other.  For Leon, it's more of a friend, while Mathilda, looks at it her emotions as being in love.  Nevertheless, for those who get disturbed by those scenes of Mathilda's emotional anguish (ala Russian Roulette) and the fact that Leon trains Mathilda on how to kill people (using a paint gun), there is a theatrical version included on the Blu-ray that eliminates those scenes and an extended version that contains those extra 24 minutes.As for the Blu-ray, I just felt the picture quality was fantastic for an early 90's film.  With quite a few 90's films that looks its age, the amount of colors and detail for on this HD release was great and the audio quality was also great.  Fans of the film will definitely enjoy this Blu-ray release, especially since it has both theatrical and extended versions of the film.Overall, a solid Blu-ray release for ""Leon the Professional"".  Highly recommended!",5,Blu-ray: Oh does this film look great on Blu...and you get both versions of the film as well!,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,6406,"['Hot', 'film', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita',

5701,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0767802519,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 6]","Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read.  He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets.  Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a ""cleaner"" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother.  Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style.  After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial.  (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.)  After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original  La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment.  He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some ""cute"" shots of his very pretty little star.  One wants to ask, ""What's a nice Jewish girl [Portman was born in Israel] like you doing in a movie like this?""What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot.  Some highlights:The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, ""He's not my father.  He's my lover."" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills.  In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, ""This is from Mathilda"" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand...  (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review!  Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.",4,"A different kind of ""Lolita""?",1100390400,"11 14, 2004",2004,3486,"['Take', 'away', 'elaborately', 'staged', 'shoot', 'ups', 'spilled', 'blood', 'rest', 'mayhem', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'love', 'story', 'sorts.Jean', 'Reno', 'stars', 'Leon', 'cold-blooded', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'people', 'skills', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'read', 'kind', 'reluctant', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'to12-year-old', 'Mathilda', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'screen', 'debut', 'kind', 'Lolita', 'mean', 'streets', 'Owing', 'little', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'portrayal', 'street', 'urchin/nymphet', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '1976', 'not', 'much', 'teenaged', 'stars', 'two', 'movie', 'Lolitas', 'Sue', 'Lyon', 'Dominique', 'Swain', 'who', 'were', 'really', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'genuine', 'nymphets', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'become', 'cleaner', 'can', 'get', 'revenge', 'Stansfield', 'psycho', 'drug', 'enforcement', 'agent', 'who', 'killed', 'little', 'brother', 'Played', 'psychotic', 'zest', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'Stansfield', 'kind', 'guy', 'who', 'pills', 'delights', 'Beethoven', 'overture', 'various', 'victims.Okay', 'not', 'surprising', 'more', 'less', 'French', 'film', 'done', 'American', 'style', 'underlying', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'will', 'not', 'ever', 'play', 'Heartland', 'America', 'Chevy', 'commercial', 'needed', 'be', 'disguised', 'action', 'thriller', 'Portman', 'really', '12-years-old', 'Nabokov', 'Lolita', 'was', 'book', 'Leon', 'really', 'do', 'live', 'together', 'declare', 'love', 'one', 'sexual', 'hanky-panky', 'hit', 'man', 'pre-adolescent', 'kiss', 'lips.What', 'French', 'director', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'best', 'known', 'States', 'very', 'interesting', 'original', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', '1990', 'accomplished', 'here', 'kind', 'elaborate', 'joke', 'movie', 'establishment', 'made', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'played', 'peek-a-boo', 'censorship', 'system', 'cute', 'shots', 'very', 'pretty', 'little', 'star', 'One', 'ask', 'What', 'nice', 'Jewish', 'girl', '[', 'Portman', 'was', 'born', 'Israel', ']', 'doing', 'movie', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'can', 'stomach', 'premise', 'mayhem', 'fine', 'acting', 'Reno', 'Portman', 'Oldman', 'support', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'really', 'outrageous', 'shtick', 'infusing', 'quirky', 'plot', 'highlights', 'scene', 'Mathilda', 'concierge', 'proudly', 'Leon', 'not', 'father', 'lover', 'subsequent', 'hasty', 'departure', 'concierge', 'establishment', 'Reno', 'obsession', 'milk', 'drinking', 'cleaning', 'plant', 'only', 'friend', '.Stansfield', 'predilection', 'touching', 'victims', 'almost', 'lovingly', 'carnivore', 'bizarre', 'body-shudder', 'pills', 'funniest', 'most', 'crowd-pleasing', 'scene', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'body', 'last', 'bloody', 'victim', 'long', 'enough', 'hear', 'fatal', 'words', 'Mathilda', 'down', 'find', 'strange', 'piece', 'metal', 'hand', 'Yes', 'really', 'vague', 'have', 'see', 'scene', 'appreciate', 'anyway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'review', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'One', 'last', 'word', 'ironic', 'R-rated', 'films', 'one', 'stars', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'movie', 'theater', 'see', 'own', 'film', 'Okay', 'one', 'more', 'last', 'word', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'developed', 'actress', 'addition', 'work', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Cold', 'Mountain', 'see', 'Anywhere', 'Here', '1999', 'entirely', 'different', 'sort', 'film', 'Susan', 'Sarandon']",N/A

That's what my review will be about.I first watched this movie when I was at Mathilda's age so it was a great timing so I could communicate with the character while watching the movie. Now, at the age of 20, I bought the DVD with additional footage and watched the movie again with a whole different eye. I won't write anything about the story. I thought the story was good enough for an american movie. Still I think so. The acting was topnotch, especially Natalie Portman. When you watch a child actor for the first time in a movie, you measure his/her acting realated to the age. You say &quot;Good for a child&quot;. But Natalie plays like she's a professional actress doing this for a long time, which doubles the success of the movie. Because mostly, if there's a child actor in the movie, you dislike it because you dislike the child's acting.So, there are great actors/actresses, there's a good plot, there's great ending, which is 50% of any movie I think, and there's great score by Eric Serra. (There's isolated score in the DVD for soundtrack fans like me)But there are some glitches related to the &quot;storytelling&quot;. My favorite director is Robert Zemeckis because I like the way he tells his story. Steven Spielberg and James Cameron are also great storytellers, also Lucas. Besson is also good but he's a little bit light.If you watched Fight Club, you'll understand what I mean. There are several ways to tell stories. One is &quot;Fight Club&quot; style I think. There's no logic in what you see but there's logic in the plot. One is Zemeckis Style. He tells really seriously his stories, you don't see anything which you cannot see. But he does with a great magic.Some directors (weak ones) can't catch any of the two spirits I mentioned above. Besson, I think is between being Zemeckis and weak. There are incredibly great moments in the movie, especially the final. But there are some freebee editing and storytelling thoroughout the movie, so it makes the movie 4 stars instead of 5. But again, it's one of the best movies made in &quot;Hollywood&quot; so far because it's real, even though it's a bit heroic. The love though, is not so much believable because Matilda is too young. But hey, I'm not from America, and I'm not a girl. Still, it doubts me if Matilda can really fall in love with Leon.So, you know the movie, buy this edition and get the real movie not the censored one.",4,Good but not Excellent,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",2001,2460,"['directors', 'define', 'job', 'storytelling', 'what', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'about.I', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'Mathilda', 'age', 'was', 'great', 'timing', 'could', 'communicate', 'character', 'watching', 'movie', 'Now', 'age', '20', 'bought', 'DVD', 'additional', 'footage', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'whole', 'different', 'eye', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'anything', 'story', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'american', 'movie', 'Still', 'think', 'so', 'acting', 'was', 'topnotch', 'especially', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'When', 'watch', 'child', 'actor', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'measure', 'his/her', 'acting', 'realated', 'age', 'say', 'quot', 'Good', 'child', 'quot', 'Natalie', 'professional', 'actress', 'doing', 'long', 'time', 'success', 'movie', 'mostly', 'child', 'actor', 'movie', 'dislike', 'dislike', 'child', 'acting.So', 'are', 'great', 'actors/actresses', 'good', 'plot', 'great', 'ending', '50', '%', 'movie', 'think', 'great', 'score', 'Eric', 'Serra', 'isolated', 'score', 'DVD', 'soundtrack', 'fans', 'are', 'glitches', 'related', 'quot', 'storytelling', 'quot', 'favorite', 'director', 'Robert', 'Zemeckis', 'like', 'way', 'story', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'James', 'Cameron', 'are', 'also', 'great', 'storytellers', 'also', 'Lucas', 'Besson', 'also', 'good', 'little', 'bit', 'watched', 'Fight', 'Club', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'what', 'mean', 'are', 'several', 'ways', 'tell', 'stories', 'One', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Club', 'quot', 'style', 'think', 'logic', 'what', 'see', 'logic', 'plot', 'One', 'Zemeckis', 'Style', 'really', 'seriously', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'great', 'magic.Some', 'directors', 'weak', 'ones', 'ca', ""n't"", 'catch', 'two', 'spirits', 'mentioned', 'above', 'Besson', 'think', 'being', 'Zemeckis', 'weak', 'are', 'incredibly', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'especially', 'final', 'are', 'freebee', 'editing', 'storytelling', 'movie', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'again', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'made', 'quot', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'so', 'far', 'real', 'even', 'bit', 'heroic', 'love', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'believable', 'Matilda', 'too', 'young', 'hey', ""'m"", 'not', 'America', ""'m"", 'not', 'girl', 'Still', 'Matilda', 'can', 'really', 'fall', 'love', 'Leon.So', 'know', 'movie', 'buy', 'edition', 'get', 'real', 'movie', 'not', 'censored', 'one']",N/A

The girl was recently orphaned when a crazed DEA agent played by Gary Oldman guns down her family in the apartment down the hall from Reno's.The movie should have been played straight and serious or absurd and comic or schmaltzy and cute, but it wandered between the three. It included ridiculous details that stopped me from taking it seriously (e.g., the DEA knows a 12-year old girl is missing from the apartment, one of them saw a young girl enter Reno's apartment right after the shootings, but they don't bother to search it). Once Reno lets the girl stay with him, he immediately agrees to train her as a hit man. A 12-year old. She manages a long-range hit with her first shot.Portman toys with her blossoming sexuality, but it isn't pushed even to the point of making the viewer seriously uncomfortable. Better to have left that bit out or played it out.An opportunity is missed when hints are dropped that Reno's boss, who supposedly holds all his money for him, is ripping him off.

A young Natalie Portman stands out as a young girl orphaned by the killings of the Bad Guys.The Director tries to make the best of both worlds, naturalism and explosive action, and succeeds in making a gripping film, but fails in maintaining the flavor of what might have been a harmonious structure consonant with similar films, such as Gregory Peck's, The Gunfighter, or Gary Cooper's, High Noon. In The Professionals, the descent into mindless savagery, made for good then-current box office quality, but not for aesthetic unity.So, for those for whom senseless violence inter-mixed with sensitive scenes among essentially vicious people (and a girl on her way into that category) this will be an eminently entertaining, even engrossing, two hours.

In lesser hands, this could easily have been nothing more than a reasonably good action movie, or worse yet, an exploitation film taking advantage of a highly taboo piece of subject matter, and that being pedophilia.  In Luc Besson's hands, it becomes a small masterpiece.The additional 24 minutes of footage in the original movie version changes the meaning of this film to a surprising degree.  As one reviewer put it (and I paraphrase here), the American version is more innocent, and takes into account American sensibilities (or non-sensibilities, as I like to put it).  The American version is a very good film, but the deleted footage added plot holes while lacking the depth and nuances in the original.Leon (played by Jean Reno) is an odd-looking 40 something year-old man with almost a childlike mind.  He may even be close to being an idiot savant in that he can do only one thing well (actually exceptionally well), and that is killing (he is a professional hit man, and the deadliest of his kind).  Although he can speak English, he cannot read, and since coming to this country has been under the influence of a mafia boss, Tony (played by Danny Aiello) who takes full advantage of Leon's abilities and especially his disabilities.  Tony hires Leon for specialized contracts, but keeps his money as his banker and only doles out a little at a time (the audience knows full well that Leon will never see much of what he has earned).  Leon is a pathetic individual who lives a secluded and lonely life.  He sleeps in a chair fully clothed with a loaded gun within arms reach.  He is an outsider with no social skills, loves only a plant, drinks only milk, and who escapes his brutal and barren reality by involving himself in old, nostalgic movies.In contrast, Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman) is a beautiful 12 year-old girl raised in a drug influenced and unloving home.  She's a young girl who is continually the brunt of her father's anger, often beaten and always neglected.  She is also a girl who, because of her environment, is streetwise well beyond her years.  She escapes her brutal reality by immersing herself into cartoons.The tragic incident that brings these two lost souls together is the murder of Mathilda's entire family (but particularly her 4 year-old brother who she dearly loves) by out-of-control DEA agents led by a truly psychotic agent, Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).Once this unlikely pair are forced together, they begin to complement each others deficiencies and needs, and this is the heart and soul of this fine film.  Leon as the reluctant protector, actually becomes her guide into the world of killing, while Mathilda, needing revenge for her little brother's death, teaches Leon to read, and ultimately to care, feel, and love.  Is it any wonder that by fulfilling such basic needs, it turns into love?  But what kind of love are we talking about?  Basically, it's the love of a father and daughter, yet there is a seething undercurrent suggesting so much more.  Mathilda easily mistakes this love as being &quot;in love&quot;, and in her limited knowledge, she IS in love.  Leon, meanwhile, denies his attraction for Mathilda to himself, and to her.  Besson handles all this with utmost care and realism.My hat goes off to the entire cast (even Oldman, although his performance is over-the-top, it is extremely chilling).  However, what makes or breaks this movie is the performance by Natalie Portman under Besson's wonderful direction.  Her roll is the key, and she lights up the screen every single second she is on it.  Her big, beautiful brown eyes sparkle with a child's laughter in one scene, then steams the screen seductively in the next.There are so many memorable scenes that there just aren't enough words allotted to describe them all.  Suffice it to say, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat and totally captivated.  Between 1 and 10, &quot;The Professional&quot; gets a marginal 8, while &quot;Leon&quot; gets a solid 9.  Admittedly, this film is not for everyone, especially those who are easily offended either by the topic or the language.  That being said, I don't think you can possibly lose with either film version.So what could make this film a 10?  To tell you the truth, the action scenes (as intense and as good as they were) often took away from the real story (I sometimes wonder what was left on the cutting room floor in lieu of some of these action scenes).  One can readily understand why this was done.  &quot;The Professional&quot; could reach a much larger audience if it highlighted the action.  Unfortunately, we live in a world where violence and death are glorified and love, especially forbidden love, is a topic that most find extremely difficult to handle, or even understand.",5,Mesmerizing,984441600,"03 13, 2001",2001,4917,"['view', 'original', 'quot', 'Leon', 'quot', 'American', 'version', 'quot', 'Professional', 'quot', 'will', 'be', 'rare', 'treat',

Of course, back then no one had any idea that we were watching an edited flick. The simple premise explores some very complex characters: an assassin with a conscience (played brilliantly by Jean Reno) and a streetwise girl too tough for her age (a beautiful and tragic Natalie Portman). The two characters are drawn together by violence and violence becomes their emotional tether.The unedited version we get here is very, very dark. The assassin agrees to teach the young girl the skills of the hitman. Soon, he is taking the girl on jobs and she becomes a tool of the trade and she quickly decides for herself when she is 'ready'.There is a wonderful complexity in the main protagonist's life: Gary Oldman. He plays a drug-addicted DEA officer with a very explosive personality. He's as crooked as they come, and Oldman is probably scarier than he normally is. And this portrayal cemented his strengths as an actor. None of this overshadows the Professional and his young sidekick, both dancing a razor's edge and never really appropriate behavior. This is not a film for everyone, and do keep in mind this is an unrated version of the film. If you can stomach the morality, or lack thereof, then you are in for a treat. Nothing is simple and despite the seriousness of the film, there are a few scenes with comedy gold. But the humour is dark in most cases, so it fits with the film's mood.The special features aren't up to par when compared to the unedited movie. We see a 10 year retrospective, an interview of both protagonists, a running track of trivia, and that's about it. We are given a 5.1 DTS audio track and HD visuals.

Leon then proceeds to teach Matilda his trade so that she can exact revenge on her family's killers.""Leon"" is one of the most unusual films that I have ever seen and also one of the best. Without a doubt, it is the best of Luc Besson's films. In a video store, this film would probably be placed in the action section, but although it contains a number of (very violent) action scenes, I don't really see this film as being an action film in the same sense that something like ""Die Hard"" is. It is more a study of the relationship between Leon and Matilda, and a very good one at that. Leon and Matilda are two extremely damaged people who manage to find love (albeit platonic love) with each other. The fact that they find this love through activities that most people would consider to be less than desirable just adds to this film's charm. It is also a study of innocence, contrasting Leon's child-like nature (the look on Reno's face as he watches a Gene Kelly movie is priceless) with that of an actual child.Everything about this film is excellent. From Besson's script and directing to Reno, Portman and Gary Oldman as the film's three leads. Although made in English with mostly American actors (except for Reno, who, bizarrely, plays an Italian) and targeted at the American/International market, this is, in fact, a French film and is stylistically more European than American, and in my opinion, is all the better for it.

Whereas the two were  simply thrown together and started a working relationship, the US cut never  explored the more realistic questions such a relationship would raise,  specifically the confused sexual attraction the child would feel for Leon  (and vice-versa).  Having viewed the uncut version, Leon and Matilda's  final &quot;I love you&quot; means so much more and transforms this from a  good film into a magnificent film.  Also compelling in this version is  Matilda's training as a cleaner, wholly absent from the US cut and leaving  the viewer unsatisfied as this in particular seemed to be the whole point  of the US cut of the film.The story in general remains the  same, however, and is largely satisfying.  The action does slow  considerably, especially during some of the added &quot;relationship&quot;  footage, so viewers expecting nothing other than a thrill ride may become  bored.  Keeping in mind that the main story is the relationship and the  action merely secondary, LEON succeeds remarkably.Jean Reno is  marvelous, as usual, and was born to play this kind of role.  Natalie  Portman shows promise that has since been realized in later roles, though  some of her character's dialogue is too mature, even for a street-hardened  child.  Gary Oldman is maniacal as the villain, but one feels that he is  straining to pull off his best Christopher Walken impression.  Beeson's  direction is the finest in his ouevre, comparable to BIG BLUE and  surpassing similar films like LA FEMME NIKITA.In summary, I would  give LEON four stars out of five compared to all films in general, but its  vast improvement over the US cut merits five stars or beyond.  It's a pity  the DVD does not provide a director's commentary track, but the bonus  footage more than compensates for the lack of special features.

No, it's a touching drama that can turn into an action movie or thriller in an instant.It has Jean Reno staring as Leon, a hitman, the best of his kind. He lives in an apartment building and his room is accross from little Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a 12 year old girl who is abused by her parents. That is soon to change though. An insane killer cop (Gary Oldman) literally whipes out her whole family because of some drugs. Mathilda is devastated..not for her parents but for her little brother. She moves in with Leon and they bond. Leon teaches her how to ""clean"" (kill people) and she teaches him how to read, cook, etc.. These moments are the best..the interaction between Leon and her. Splendid to watch.The movie is a sad tale of love and war..a wonderful thriller...or drama..or action...The acting is amazing notably by Gary Oldman who steals the show. He is in my opinion the best secondary actor of all time and his savage attitude and his darkly comic moments add so much to this movie.The score is fantastic with a great beath that goes along with the flow of the movie.

Her performance left me with my jaw on the floor for most of the film when I first saw it, and I still can't help but watch her in awe when I load it up again now and then.  Prior to seeing this film, I had only seen her in Phantom Menace, and at the time, I simply couldn't understand what all the fuss about her talent was...her wooden-seeming performance as Princess Amidala left me quite indifferent.  But now that I've seen her incredible brilliance in its most potent form - here in this film when she was still amazingly young, I believe she is indeed one of this generation's greatest and most unique talents.  I am a huge fan of Jean Reno and Luc Bisson as well, but I find that their talents are diluted whenever they are &quot;anglicized/americanized&quot; as in this film.  In their native french, they are both marvels of the screen.  La Femme Nikita is another, better example; I remember hating the american/dubbed version of it, but loving the original.  The plot itself is ok, but nothing spectacular, and as for Gary Oldman, although he can often be wonderful in his performances, in this movie he really misses.  I'm not sure if he took the method school of acting too much to heart and enjoyed some of the drugs that his character did before his scenes, but whatever the reason, &quot;over the top&quot; (as described by many other reviewers) is putting it mildly.As for this uncut version, there is no reason for anyone to own any other version of the film; the american release (&quot;The Professional&quot;) is an insult to both the director's vision and to the audience.Even now, I have a difficult time watching the ending of this film; it leaves me teary-eyed and with a lump in my throat that doesn't go away for hours, and the primary reason is again Natalie Portman's unbelievable performance.  After watching her in this film, you'll find it almost impossible to believe that you're watching a 13/14-year-old actress.

Spoken by little [..]Natalie Portman, which becomes the earmark of my early attentions that The Professional was more than your run of the mill action movie. In fact, Natalie Portman may not have been the focus of this film but every ounce of her characterization of Mathilda stood out as owning this films reputation as an underground international hit.I can't give justice to the power she releases at the explosive ending with Leon that comes straight from some everyone-dies-Scorsese-mob-ending. Her invoking sobs are stomach clutching and her innate control is so fantastic it's frighteningly genius. It's almost impossible for me to discover the means for her to of have created such a complete character with such genuine passion when I consider the real life pressures such as the presence of people and running camera's absorbing every nuance of her countenance and paired against such dominating presence as Jean Reno and Gary Oldman no less!At film ending, I felt obligated beyond an audiance member, as if some member in an important film jury. Obligated to award that outstanding performance. Because in the movie business, audiences (unlike sports spectators who support having the best of athlets)do not reward the best of movie making. They rush to see movies like spider man 3, and oceans and reward them with unbelievable revenues that executives celebrate over. This under the radar revenge film with a bizarrly genius child actor was more than just a klatch of hollywood moments, it was a delicate lingo of sexual undertones. It was a 'becoming of age'-ness, and metamorphisized rebirth. This child was fantastic and worth droves of applause. She literally and metaphorically walks away from the hollywood glitch and glamour at some point. Away from the eye catching fire, and explosions. The throngs of police extra's, and of the cliche final showdown. She walks away as a child would, but with the aged spirit of a master actress, spliting the story in no better way for me into that scence of departure.On the one side is this man Leon: the revenge gun for hire story; and then the other side is about a precious girl coming of age under extraordinary circumstances which parallels the slave of Leon's rebirth from soulessness. ""Is it always this hard?"" She asks Leon with the blood of the dead on her face. And as if questioning the validity of her own living, sweeps the blood with her hand and stares at it. ""No."" Exclaims Leon without emotion. Planted behind Leon's mirrory glasses at that moment is his rebirth.Note: I bought this movie on Amazon, but oddly, I am not certified by Amazon.",5,"""Is it always this hard?""

5747,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0767802519,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 6]","Luc Besson's ""The Professional""  raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are good and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fat man's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.Leon however does not work only on this primary level; it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it; the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerizing fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: its art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven.

Natalie Portman is Oscar material as a child who tries to be tough but in the end can only do what a child can do.

His life is enitrely unextraordinary, except for one thing - he is an assassin.Mathilda is twelve going on thirty after years of being the most responsible person in a family of corrupt and compassionless individuals. When her one consolation, her baby brother, is killed along with the rest of the family during a botched drug deal, she flees to her neighbor's door, praying for mercy as she begs him to respond to her knocking.A middle-aged man and a 12-year-old girl? - I thought you said this was a love story, you're thinking. Don't become uncomfortable just yet. Though this is as much a suspense/drama as anything (with the ingenious Gary Oldman as another notoriously disgusting villain) it is the relationship that develops between the leads that is most remarkable. As Leon trains Mathilda to be an assassin and (in a contractdictory spin) teaches her some basic integrity as well, she shows him the value of &quot;living&quot; rather than simply existing.

It blew me away but it was apparent to me even then that it had been edited! I was so thrilled to finally get to see the director's cut which is much more witty, sophisticated and really explores the uncharted territory of human emotions.Although on the surface it is a fairly forthright tale of loss and revenge with a very sympathetic 12-year-old protagonist and a 40 something antihero, it cleverly reverses the emotional maturity of the pair, Matilde is obviously smarter, more cunning and more sexually mature than the emotionally dead hitman who reluctantly takes her in after she is orphaned.Leon is terribly antisocial, illiterate, slow witted and appears to be sexually immature. Once Matilde comes into his life, his actions are that of an adolescent falling in love for the first time.  The precocious girl smokes, curses, drinks, has murderous tendencies and is a habitual liar. The directors cut not only allows us to experience Leon as a professional killer and as a teacher, but allows us to watch the prepubescent Matilde trying to seduce the first man she loves.The prudish editing initially deprived the viewer of watching the robotic Leon and the abused Matilde experience emotional growth which awakens in them both the human desires we all have: to love someone and want to be with them and share the rest of your life with them.

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[2, 3]","Jean Reno as ""The Professional"" brings to film a killer version of a man who is hesitant about life and rigid about relationships. That the movie comes under the guise of a hitman, or cleaner as Leon calls himself, is merely the dressing for the real story--the relationship between Leon and Matilda.Matilda is the 12-year-old daughter of a scumbag, small-time drug dealer, who has little control of himself, eases his frustrations through his hot wife and against his young daughter, Matilda. She is supposed to be in boarding school and out of the way when a DEA officer comes for his cocaine or retribution. Gary Oldman is the agent with his staff of crooked cops and dope dealers. Matilda escapes murder when her neighbor, Leon, takes her in.Natalie Portman as Matilda is pubescent and childishly provocative in an unintentional way. Their relationship deepens as he trains Matilda in the craft of ""cleaning."" Trust buds. His heart, so closed, much like Silas Marner, gradually opens to Matilda's openness, much like Eppie's. The difference is, of course, the time period. Silas and Eppie had a father-daughter relationship because it was merry ole England in the Victorian Period. Leon and Matilda live in the Italian area of New York--he is a killer, she is the daughter of a drug dealer. Boundaries are much less strict.Even though Leon always remains fatherly toward Matilda, given time, that stance may have changed, and probably would to the satisfaction of them both. But that Lolita position never arrived because the Oldman character intervened.The story with all its corruption of character, hardness of heart, violence to the max, ends in a pastoral-like scene.

This version has scenes I don't remember from the summer, so I assume it's somewhat of a director's cut.The thing is, while Reno is good (and his character is good), it's not enough to carry the movie.  Now, everyone talks about how fabulous Portman was in this movie.  And when I saw it on TV, I did think she was good, although I felt the character of Mathilda was too one-dimensional.  I wasn't emotionally invested in her character, so I didn't really care much about her part of the story.

Cockrel,"[16, 17]","Like most fans of this modern-day action classic, I was unaware that an alternate version with additional footage existed.After reading a review of &quot;Leon, The Professional,&quot; I decided to order the DVD and was not dissappointed.  If you never understood that this movie is really a love story and not an action film, this version will make it crystal clear.  While the original holds up well, Luc Besson's Director's Cut adds depth and complexity to the relationship between Leon(Jean Reno) and Mathilda(Natalie Portman).Of course, this may be the very reason why some fans will still prefer the original US theatrical release of the film.  The additional footage causes the film to drag in spots and for those fans who just want carnage this may be a downer.These scenes also show the 12-year-old Mathilde's growing romantic infatuation with Leon. Though Besson handles this responsibly and with sensitivity, it is nonetheless sure to make some viewers queasy.Nevertheless, for open-minded viewers who like a little character development with their bulletfests, &quot;Leon, The Professional&quot; is clearly the superior version.My only complaints are this:  First, it would have made far more sense to have waited to release this film as a &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot;-style &quot;Ultimate Edition&quot; that included both the original US cut and the Director's Cut on one disc.  That way viewers could've had the best of both worlds.  Many die-hard fans of this movie likely already own &quot;The Professional&quot; on DVD and are now going to be debating whether or not they want to buy &quot;Leon, The Professional&quot; for the additional footage.Secondly, this DVD is remarkably light on extras.  Other than the obligatory trailers, the only other item of note is a set of still photos showing variant promo-posters from around the world.Given that this is a Director's Cut, a commentary from Besson explaining why he edited out the restored scenes for the original American release would've been quite enlightening.But the real reason to own this DVD is the film itself.  Unlike all too many all too many directors who don't understand that some &quot;lost&quot; footage should stay lost, Besson has done us a service by making this version available to fans.",4,A Director's Cut that's worth seeing,985910400,"03 30, 2001",2001,2287,"['most', 'fans', 'modern-day', 'action', 'classic', 'was', 'unaware', 'alternate', 'version', 'additional', 'footage', 'existed.After', 'reading', 'review', 'quot', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'quot', 'decided', 'order', 'DVD', 'was', 'not', 'dissappointed', 'never', 'understood', 'movie', 'really', 'love', 'story', 'not', 'action', 'film', 'version', 'will', 'make', 'crystal', 'clear', 'original', 'up', 'well', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'Director', 'Cut', 'depth', 'complexity', 'relationship', 'Leon', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Mathilda', 'Natalie', 'Portman', '.Of', 'course', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'reason', 'why', 'fans', 'will', 'still', 'prefer', 'original', 'US', 'theatrical', 'release', 'film', 'additional', 'footage', 'film', 'drag', 'spots', 'fans', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'carnage', 'may', 'be', 'downer.These', 'scenes', 'also', 'show', '12-year-old', 'Mathilde', 'growing', 'romantic', 'infatuation', 'Leon', 'Though', 'Besson', 'responsibly', 'sensitivity', 'nonetheless', 'sure', 'make', 'viewers', 'queasy.Nevertheless', 'open-minded', 'viewers', 'who', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'bulletfests', 'quot', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'quot', 'clearly', 'superior', 'version.My', 'only', 'complaints', 'are', 'First', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'far', 'more', 'sense', 'have', 'waited', 'release', 'film', 'quot', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgement', 'Day', 'quot', '-style', 'quot', 'Ultimate', 'Edition', 'quot', 'included', 'original', 'US', 'cut', 'Director', 'Cut', 'one', 'disc', 'way', 'viewers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'best', 'worlds', 'Many', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'movie', 'likely', 'already', 'own', 'quot', 'Professional', 'quot', 'DVD', 'are', 'now', 'going', 'be', 'debating', 'not', 'want', 'buy', 'quot', 'Leon', 'Professional', 'quot', 'additional', 'footage.Secondly', 'DVD', 'remarkably', 'light', 'extras', 'Other', 'obligatory', 'trailers', 'only', 'other', 'item', 'note', 'set', 'still', 'photos', 'showing', 'variant', 'promo-posters', 'world.Given', 'Director', 'Cut', 'commentary', 'Besson', 'explaining', 'why', 'edited', 'out', 'restored', 'scenes', 'original', 'American', 'release', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quite', 'real', 'reason', 'own', 'DVD', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'too', 'many', 'directors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'quot', 'lost', 'quot', 'footage', 'should', 'stay', 'lost', 'Besson', 'done', 'service', 'making', 'version', 'available', 'fans']",N/A
5773,AKS9SJTHTU0OM,0767802519,K. Gordon,"[0, 0]","Determinedly odd, over the top and a lot of fun. This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his &#34;Dr. Strangelove&#34; mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure.Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon.Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique.The blu-ray looks great provides both the theatrical and (better, to my eye) extended director's cut and has some solid bonus features besides.",4,"Determinedly odd, over the top and a lot of fun",1387584000,"12 21, 2013",2013,1533,"['Determinedly', 'odd', 'top', 'lot', 'fun', 'strangely', 'sentimental', 'wonderfully', 'photographed', 'very', 'violent', 'black', 'comedy', 'demented', 'marriage', 'sincere', 'Disney', 'film', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'looking', 'father', 'intentionally', 'disquieting', 'French', 'twist', 'lover', 'top', 'darkness', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Kubrick', '34', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove', '34', 'mode', 'John', 'Woo', 'action', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.Sound', 'weird', 'Well', 'are', 'huge', 'logic', 'jumps', 'gaping', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', 'disarms', 'potential', 'problems', 'never', 'pretending', 'be', 'world', 'know', 'creating', 'heightened', 'strange', 'through-', 'the-looking-glass', 'reality', 'where', 'hit', 'men', 'are', 'sweet', 'softies', 'heart', 'New', 'York', 'cops', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'corrupt', 'openly', 'bat-sh', '@', 't', 'insane', 'gunning', 'down', 'whomever', 'way', 'gleeful', 'abandon.Gary', 'Oldman', 'way', 'way', 'top', 'baddie', 'blast', 'process', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'real', 'pathos', 'sad', 'faced', 'killer', 'who', 'so', 'alone', 'almost', 'child-like', 'having', 'learn', 'relate', 'human', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'shockingly', 'complex', 'performance', 'actress', 'so', 'young', 'playing', 'so', 'tricky', 'role', 'film', 'could', 'understand', 'someone', 'hating', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Besson', 'decidedly', 'off-beat', 'vibe', 'go', 'rarest', 'film', 'creatures', 'something', 'unique.The', 'blu-ray', 'great', 'theatrical', 'better', 'eye', 'extended', 'director', 'cut', 'solid', 'bonus', 'features']",N/A

It's a classic tale of an Assassin that doesn't have a care in the world, he just lives, kills, eats, sleeps and repeats process.  Until one day he finds something to care about and it turns his world upside down.The acting is superb, Natalie Portman is just creepy as a 12-year old girl that grew up waaay too fast in a broken-down home.  Her dramtic rantings, while over the top, are quite fascinating and downright funny to watch.  I swear, I still can't look at her the same in Star Wars with her awesome outfits after watching the International Version of Leon a few months ago.I also love all of Jean Reno's acting; he always plays a foreigner and a rather calm character, which makes him quite the action hero from Godzilla to Ronin to Mission Impossible.  He did a great job as the emotionally confused assassin.Gary Oldan is VERY creepy in Leon as the disgruntled DIA agent gone seriously wrong.  I watched Batman Begins a while ago and his character as the ""good cop"" just wasn't right because I know him as the detective from Leon.  See how much an impact this movie has on my future movie viewings?  This should be a hint as to how this movie stays with you.The story (as mentioned before) is quite an original and classic tale.

Although the film is at moments very thrilling and very interesting it does have fatal flaws and elements to its story that bring the whole thing down. Is it a good action film? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. Does it deserve the four and five star reviews? No.The main flaw is the age of Natalie Portman and her character. I assume that most got past this but I myself could not wrap myself could wrap my mind around a twelve-year-old doing these things. This thought was always in the back of my head as I viewed this film and it was a flaw that brought the movie down. Portman was excellent but she should have been a few years older. Her age doesn't ruin the movie it merely lowers its impact and credibility.Jean Reno's performance is the highlight of the film and the film is worth seeing for him alone. He really makes this cold, hard killer he plays human and the scenes between Portman and him are great if only for the nervousness in the air between the two created by Reno. Every time he spits his milk is a classic moment. Gary Oldman's performance as the crooked cop is at times good but most of the time it borders dangerously close to overacting and this is crippling to his character. It is hard to get a reading off of him.Luc Besson's directing is very good with many exciting action scenes (although some veer a little too close to cheesy) and neat little bits of camera work such as the very beginning stuff and the final battle. He has an obvious sense of story and I believe the film is exactly as he wanted it.

5778,A1OZAYRJQAERTK,0767802519,Larry Benjamin,"[0, 0]","I remember when this film first came out and I saw the trailer.  It was the scene with the very young Natalie Portman asking Jean Reno what his job is, and he answers ""cleaner,"" then she says ""you mean a hitman,"" he confirms it, and she says, ""cool.""  It looked intriguing and I aways wanted to see it.I wasn't expecting ""Sansho the Bailiff,"" but at least a coherent storyline, believable characters, and events that could actually happen on some planet somewhere.  Leon, played by Jean Reno, is supposedly the best hit man in New York, but he lives in a hovel while his handler, ""Tony"" played by Danny Aiello, claims to be holding his money for him.  I fully expected some showdown between those two, as everything was telegraphing that Tony had no intention of ever letting Leon have his money except for doling out a little occasionally.  It is also revealed that Leon is illiterate, drinks only milk, and is inordinately attached to a houseplant that he introduces as his ""only friend.""  Very well, a hit man is never going to be ""normal"" in any sense.Mathilda, played by Natalie Portman, asks Leon to allow her to be his apprentice after her family is murdered.  Leon tries to cheer her up with a puppet, showing himself to be at heart a funny and playful fellow (he also likes old musicals), but the relationship between the two is implausible.  Leon agrees to take her on after she fires off a few rounds from his balcony and they have to suddenly leave the apartment, houseplant in hand, when any real hitman would have left her there as too great a risk.  She soon comes in handy when she can fill out the registration card at the hotel they next stay in, but surely Leon has stayed in hotels in the past - how did he register before?  In a particularly amoral scene, Leon shows Mathilda how to shoot a rifle, firing what turns out to be a squib at a jogger.  As someone who has owned and used firearms for many years, I can vouch for the fact that the normal course of instruction involves practicing at a range with paper targets, or in the desert with soda cans, before actually shooting at a live target.  Hardly ""professional"" as Leon says about Mathilda's balcony shooting spree.Stripping away the violence and lurid charm of a hitman, at bottom this is the story of a middle-aged curmudgeon forced to care for a waif, and developing an attachment against his better judgment.  This was done far better two years later in the Academy-Award winning ""Kolya,"" a vastly superior film with a significant historical and political element utterly lacking from ""The Professional.""""The Professional"" is yet another one suitable only for those who have committed to seeing every film ever made.",1,I waited 20 years to see this?,1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2699,"['remember', 'when', 'film', 'first', 'came', 'saw', 'trailer', 'was', 'scene', 'very', 'young', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'asking', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'what', 'job', 'cleaner', 'then', 'mean', 'hitman', 'cool', 'looked', 'intriguing', 'aways', 'wanted', 'see', 'it.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'Sansho', 'Bailiff', 'least', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'believable', 'characters', 'events', 'could', 'actually', 'happen', 'planet', 'somewhere', 'Leon', 'played', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'supposedly', 'best', 'hit', 'man', 'New', 'York', 'hovel', 'handler', 'Tony', 'played', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'be', 'holding', 'money', 'fully', 'expected', 'showdown', 'two', 'everything', 'was', 'telegraphing', 'Tony', 'had', 'intention', 'ever', 'letting', 'Leon', 'have', 'money', 'doling', 'out', 'little', 'occasionally', 'also', 'revealed', 'Leon', 'illiterate', 'only', 'milk', 'inordinately', 'attached', 'houseplant', 'only', 'friend', 'Very', 'well', 'hit', 'man', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'normal', 'sense.Mathilda', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Leon', 'allow', 'be', 'apprentice', 'family', 'murdered', 'Leon', 'cheer', 'up', 'puppet', 'showing', 'be', 'heart', 'funny', 'playful', 'fellow', 'also', 'old', 'musicals', 'relationship', 'two', 'implausible', 'Leon', 'take', 'few', 'rounds', 'balcony', 'have', 'suddenly', 'leave', 'apartment', 'houseplant', 'hand', 'when', 'real', 'hitman', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'too', 'great', 'risk', 'soon', 'handy', 'when', 'can', 'fill', 'out', 'registration', 'card', 'hotel', 'next', 'stay', 'surely', 'Leon', 'stayed', 'hotels', 'past', 'how', 'did', 'register', 'particularly', 'amoral', 'scene', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'how', 'shoot', 'rifle', 'firing', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'squib', 'jogger', 'someone', 'who', 'owned', 'used', 'firearms', 'many', 'years', 'can', 'vouch', 'fact', 'normal', 'course', 'instruction', 'practicing', 'range', 'paper', 'targets', 'desert', 'soda', 'cans', 'actually', 'shooting', 'live', 'target', 'Hardly', 'professional', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'balcony', 'shooting', 'spree.Stripping', 'away', 'violence', 'lurid', 'charm', 'hitman', 'bottom', 'story', 'middle-aged', 'curmudgeon', 'forced', 'care', 'waif', 'developing', 'attachment', 'better', 'judgment', 'was', 'done', 'far', 'better', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'Academy-Award', 'winning', 'Kolya', 'vastly', 'superior', 'film', 'significant', 'historical', 'political', 'element', 'utterly', 'lacking', 'Professional', 'Professional', 'yet', 'one', 'suitable', 'only', 'who', 'have', 'committed', 'seeing', 'film', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

It will have you rooting for a serial killer who is teaching a 12-year-old the tricks of the trade. No kidding!Jean Reno, who has probably never given a poor performance, is perfectly cast as an illiterate killer for hire. When Natalie Portman's family -- which lives in his building -- is murdered by bad cop-cocaine dealer Gary Oldman and crew, not yet teenager Portman survives and takes up housekeeping with the illiterate neighbor, a witness to the murders that is a full-time contractor to restaranteur Danny Aiello, playing the kind of gritty New York role that's made him famous.You've probably already figured out this movie contains a lot of profanity, killing, bloodletting, foul play, and good guy-bad guy technique that's typical in this kind of urban drug-induced ""police"" drama. What you haven't figured out -- and what you won't until you see this film -- is the affectionate relationship it creates between older than her years but still youthful Portman and her new father figure and the way this relationship will addict you to this film.Their relationship is about as connective as that torch you still carry for the high school sweetheart that got away. It sits beneath the surface eating up emotional bandwidth and retaining a place in your shattered psyche. The relationship between Portman and Reno (pronounced renn-Oh, not like the city in Nevada) will do the same thing to you.I had no idea this movie, now 13 years of age, had all this going for it. It's a film that catches you unprepared. You want to see all the killing and be neutralized by its brutality. Yet this tender relationship between two down and out figures draws you in like a wet kitten at your front door whose mother was just run over by a car in the street. It melts your heart. Meanwhile, Gary Oldman is the [erfect foil, the epitome of evil. He gets his later in a memorable scene with our hero, Reno.You have all this to look forward to as many times as you want by buying, renting, or borrowing this wonderful movie.

5780,AFO4PZPVV9RVJ,0767802519,"Laszlo ""Laszlo""","[5, 5]","Let me get the one drawback out first...Gary Oldman did as well as he could with how badly his character was written. He did very well, but with another 5 or 10 minutes of character development and story his character, Stansfield, the head antagonist, could have been written 20 times better. But that's not enough to mess up the movie by a long shot! I have totally fallen in love with both Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in this. This movie answers the question of just how deep and warm and human a ""hitman"" can be written. The few extra minutes of this so-called ""International Version"" makes all the difference, too! We really get a feel for how much pain and how screwed up he has made his life because of one mistake in his past - a mistake that would present a decision difficult for anyone to make. The extreme polar opposite of this adoring younster, portrayed frighteningly well by Ms. Portman, makes him reluctantly take a look at himself, possibly giving him a chance to heal, to pay back an unspoken debt to his past. The places where there is no dialog at all are the most moving. The beauty, pain, and humanity are haunting. Oh, plus there's lots of kick-butt gunplay, too. But that hair! Natalie Portman sports one of the best, most adorable Pageboy Bobs in the universe. Her amazing ""young Uma Thurman-esque"" face and voice and acting are amplified 100-fold by the hairstyle that she so unfortnuatly had for only this one movie.

5781,A1L43KWWR05PCS,0767802519,Lawyeraau,"[20, 22]","I caught this film on cable the other night and decided to watch it because it featured a terrific cast. How can one resist a movie featuring sexy Frenchman Jean Reno, the beautiful Natalie Portman in one of her earliest roles, Gary Oldman, and Danny Aiello?The film centers around the relationship that develops between a beautiful and precocious twelve year old girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), and an Italian hit man named Leon (Jean Reno). Mathilda and her family live in the same run down building as Leon and are, in fact, neighbors.It seems that  Mathilda's dad (Michael Badalucco) has run into a problem with rogue Federal Drug Enforcement Agent  Stansfield (Gary Oldman) over some missing cocaine. When Stansfield and his crew gets into a shootout with dear old Dad in the family  apartment, wiping out her family, Mathilda alone survives. When Stansfield realizes, however, that there were three children in the family and only two are accounted for among the dead, he knows that he has to hunt her down before she denounces him for what he is, a cold blooded, killer cop.Mathilda turns to Leon for help in her rather precarious situation. Of the two, Leon and Mathilda, it is hard to decide who is the more innocent. Leon gets his hit contracts through an intermediary, a wise guy named Tony (Danny Aiello). Tony always assures Leon that he is holding all his earnings for him, as Leon cannot read and write. Leon is your quintessential killer with a heart of gold. Mathilda, on the other hand, though still a child, is a pretty wily little miss with nerves of steel. It would be difficult to pull the wool over her eyes. Together, however,  Leon and Mathilda go on a voyage of discovery, as each finds in the other something that captures the heart.Notwithstanding  this, the film is very much an action film. It is a rip roaring journey, as Leon and Mathilda try to evade Stansfield, the killer cop with no heart and a drug habit that would kill off lesser humans. Some of the situations are absolutely ingenious and a total trip. There is enough action in this film to satisfy even the most jaded of thrill seekers. Luc Besson, the director, has turned out a top notch, first class thriller.Natalie Portman is luminous as Mathilda, a kid from the school of hard knocks. Her beauty, as well as her acting talent, is evident even at this early stage of her development, and there are a few almost uncomfortable Lolita-like moments in the film. There is even a scene somewhat reminiscent of the rose petal scene in the film ""American Beauty"", sans the rose petals.Oldman is positively chilling with his almost over the top, edgy, manic performance. Danny Aiello is terrific as Tony, the smooth talking mob guy whom the viewer knows is taking advantage of Leon's simplicity and trust, enriching himself in the process.Jean Reno, however, will  melt your heart, becoming an almost mythic, romantic hero. I have to wonder why this amazing, sexy actor never made it really big in the United States. He is sensational as the killer with a heart. He also has some high voltage action scenes in this highly stylized film that will take your breath away.An uncut international version of this film with an additional twenty four minutes of footage has recently been released on DVD. It is listed on my Amazon wish list where I hope my children will find it and take a hint. It is definitely a film worth adding to one's personal collection.

5783,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,0767802519,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 3]","Luc Besson is often described as the ""French Spielberg,"" preferring large stylish popular films.  For this film, the French Academy of Cinema nominated him as Best Director.  While he would eventually win the French award for ""The Fifth Element,"" this film also represents Jean Reno's sole French award nomination as Best Actor.  Neither did the film win the 1994 Best Film award in France, for which it was nominated.While much recommends the film, historically it may come to be best remembered as the launching pad of Natalie Portman's career.  She of course has gone on to ""Star Wars,"" ""Cold Mountain,"" ""Zoolander,"" ""V is for Vendetta"" as well as her Academy Award-nominated performance in ""Closer"" which also earned her a Golden Globe.  As 12-year old Mathilda, Portman expresses a huge range of emotions and a profoundly deep performance for this young actress born in Jerusalem.Jean Reno is also amazing as the assassin Leon.  His performance as the fastidious loner who discovers that there is more to life is moving.  The final sequence in the hallway as his death approaches and he knows that he's got villain Stansfield is classic cinema.  Besson allows nice touches such as the plant put in & out of the window and eventually planted by Mathilda.The three supporting performances are also on an excellent level.  Michael Badalucco from TV's ""The Practice"" does a good job as Mathilda's weak-willed drug-dealing daddy.  Gary Oldman is over the top as the dastardly dire DEA-corrupted Stansfield who shoots Mathilda's 4-year old brother.  Danny Aiello whose sole Oscar nomination came in 1989 for ""Do the Right Thing"" turns in a good performance as the restranteur Tony who books hits and keeps all of Leon's funs ""for safe keeping.""This little gem of a film is well worth checking out.

But then I say to myself: every work has been valued both by how we like it and by how much it gives effect of the idea of its author...This second thinking reassures me and I vote ""5 stars"".""The Professional"", in fact, has an excellent consistency around an original and effective idea, an idea that can transmit emotions. After many years, I have to find it is true still. Leon is a perfect killer but he is a child in every other way: he is not independent, he has not an his real life, he eats only milk, he sleeps on a chair and when he is not working he cares of a small plant (""it's the sole my friend"" he says) or goes at a matinee to see old musicals.Look the front line of Jean Reno  (what wonderful performance!) who enjoys ""Singin'in the rain"" looking around himself in the empty cinema, as he has fears his happiness could been seen by someone.Matilda (Natalie Portman) is alone, her family has been butchered by a squad of psychopathic and corrupt policemen, and she throws herself on Leon. At beginning he repulses her, and he almost kills her while she is sleeping, but he has stopped himself. From this gesture, normally of hate but now of charity, an alliance is formed between them, and love. This love is shown with much discretion, Matilda is only twelve years!, but it is deep-rooted in a will of surviving that perhaps is the base of all the unions apparently more mature.This is an excellent action-movie too, the scenes of the killer's jobs and of the carnage in the Matilda's house are not inferior of those in ""Nikita"" (maybe she was the older Matilda...).Like in all great movies, not only the good, the bad too is  unforgettable: the policeman by Gary Oldman put himself in our head and there will remain!

5792,A3AYDEWU1EPF15,0767802519,Luis Hernandez,"[150, 163]","French director Luc Besson (&quot;The Messenger&quot;; &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;) made his U.S. film debut with this intelligent thriller of  an Italian hitman who is untouchable. &quot;The Professional&quot; stars  Jean Reno (&quot;The Big Blue&quot;) who plays Leon, a professional hitman  with ninja-like skills, who eliminates rivals for a mob boss (Danny  Aiello).After a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman) eliminates the family  residing next door due to a drug transaction gone wrong, Leon finds himself  the guardian of young Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut).  Taking Mathilda under his helm, Leon teaches her the art of the  &quot;cleaner&quot;. However, danger lurks around every corner, and Leon  must protect Mathilda from the same cops who killed her family.Considered by many to be his masterpiece, &quot;The Professional&quot;  was originally released internationally under the title &quot;Leon&quot;.  However due to the feeling that American audiences might find some material  unacceptable, over 24 minutes of the film was edited out. Finally,  Columbia/Tri-Star has made an excellent decision in releasing the uncut,  international version of this excellent film in the U.S. as it originally  was called in August 2000.While the film's central theme revolves  around Leon and his job, the subplot where Mathilda develops an attraction  for Leon is reminiscent of the novel/film &quot;Lolita&quot;. The chemistry  between both characters in a father/daughter relationship can be intense,  especially as we notice that Mathilda is in her puberty-stage.Jean Reno  is excellent as always, and Gary Oldman gives a chilling performance as  Stansfield, the wicked DEA officer who murdered Mathilda's family in cold  blood. However, the real scene-stealer in this film has to be Natalie  Portman. This beautiful young girl radiates beauty and professionalism  throughout the film. Her porcelain-looking skin, and her big brown eyes are  well utilized in this film, making her character more childish, yet mature  to a certain extent. Portman proved to audiences in this film that she was  no flash in the pan, and in her subsequent films, she continues to be a  scene-stealer. She is truly Hollywood's most gifted young actress.In the  international version, most of the 24 minutes that were left out in the  film's 1994 release in the U.S. mainly involves both Leon and Mathilda  going on &quot;cleaning sweeps&quot; where she gets first hand training in  the art of assassination. The other half of these minutes focuses on  Mathilda's attraction to Leon. Her persistent attempts to be intimate with  Leon all fail, but we finally understand why Leon remains a loner when it  comes to affairs if the heart. Some might be uncomfortable about the idea  of Mathilda and Leon sharing a bed together, but Besson paints this scene  as one involving platonic love and not sex.In wrapping up, I recommend  this film for anyone who enjoys a nonstop, high-impact thriller in the same  tradition as the &quot;Matrix,&quot; &quot;Blade,&quot; or &quot;Dead  Calm&quot;. Luc Besson truly is one of the world's greatest action  directors, and &quot;Leon&quot; captures his magic.

5794,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,0767802519,magellan,"[5, 6]","This intelligent and action-packed thriller made me stand up and take notice of several actors who I hadn't known before, as well as the work of director Luc Besson. Few action thrillers are as original as this one; after all, there are only so many shoot-'em ups that you can stage before the whole idea becomes shopworn. But this one manages more than a few original twists and turns--as in the Lolita-like love story between the young girl and the older man, which was downplayed in the American version by cutting some of the footage that was left in the European release of the film. Sometimes it doesn't pay to live in the land where stodgy and/or prudish characters like Mrs. Grundy and Samuel Bowdler were icons--you get these Bowdlerized versions of European films. :-)Jean Reno is terrific as the hitman with a heart, and Natalie Portman is impressive as the precocious 12-year old who has lost her family to the corrupt cop, played by Gary Oldman. Oldman is superb as always, but perhaps plays his part even more over top than usual, as the double-dealing, cocaine-snorting cop who's searching for Reno and Portman after a drug deal goes bad. Also, I hadn't seen Danny Aiello in many years, and it was good to see he's still working.The whole cast is terrific, and there's enough action in the flick to satisfy even the most jaded taste. I thought Reno was the most memorable, which is saying something as it's no mean feat to upstage Portman or Oldman in this film, but he's just great as the simple, but big-hearted hitman with acrobatic, ninja-like skills. Each scene is memorable and just well written and tightly directed. There's no wasted verbiage or action.With the restoration of over 20 minutes of previously cut footage the movie has even more appeal than the original. I think this movie is the best of its genre and easily stands heads and shoulders above the competition with a strong plot and story, engaging characters, strong performances, and enough action to fill up three lesser movies.

5796,A2JA6A2Q7FJJMS,0767802519,Matthew Colville,"[13, 29]","There is a difference between things we like and things which are good. The Professional (aka Leon) isn't very good. It's the story of a guy who  gets paid a lot of money to kill people, and there's nothing particularly  revealing or insightful about this. In fact, quite the opposite. The title  character is very cool. Movie assassins are cool. It's neat to watch Jean  Reno shoot people. But it's a comic book, in the very worst sense of the  term. It's utterly unrealistic and the only things that are enjoyable about  it depend entirely on that unrealism. Luc Besson doesn't know any more  about assassins than your dentist does. It's absolutely escapism.That  being said, it's a hell of a lot of fun. Extremely enjoyable. Lots of fun  to watch with your friends, particularly because there's not a lot of  dialog, so you can comment over the action. It's not the type of movie that  you need to own, however. It's so broadly drawn, exactly like a cartoon,  that as soon as you *think* about it, much less look at the cover of the  movie, everything in it instantly comes back to you, and you'll find  yourself looking for something that's even minutely rewarding to watch more  than once.Gary Oldman, on the same really dedicated drug binge that  carried him through most of the 90s, is just one notch too high. It's  possible to see that he could have turned in a performance that would scare  you, but he opted to play it over the top. This was probably a bad idea,  although he'd ratchet it up even further in The 5th Element.When this  movie first came out, many reviewers were disturbed by the relationship  between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. Others tried to dismiss this by  claiming it was familial rather than romantic. Both sides are wrong. Leon  has the mind of a child. Intellectually and emotionally, he's younger than  Natalie Portman's character. Their relationship is puppy love, so it's  romantic in whatever limited sense puppy love can be, but that's all.  There's nothing morally dangerous here, no-one's going to be corrupted by  this movie, except insofar as it might lead them to confuse things they  like with things that are good.",4,Extremely Enjoyable,965347200,"08 4, 2000",2000,2164,"['difference', 'things', 'like', 'things', 'are', 'good', 'Professional', 'Leon', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'story', 'guy', 'who', 'paid', 'lot', 'money', 'kill', 'people', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'revealing', 'insightful', 'fact', 'quite', 'opposite', 'title', 'character', 'very', 'cool', 'Movie', 'assassins', 'are', 'cool', 'neat', 'watch', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'shoot', 'people', 'comic', 'book', 'very', 'worst', 'sense', 'term', 'utterly', 'unrealistic', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'depend', 'entirely', 'unrealism', 'Luc', 'Besson', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'assassins', 'dentist', 'absolutely', 'escapism.That', 'being', 'said', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'Extremely', 'enjoyable', 'Lots', 'fun', 'watch', 'friends', 'particularly', 'not', 'lot', 'dialog', 'can', 'comment', 'action', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'need', 'own', 'however', 'so', 'broadly', 'drawn', 'exactly', 'cartoon', 'as', 'soon', '*think*', 'much', 'less', 'look', 'cover', 'movie', 'everything', 'instantly', 'back', ""'ll"", 'find', 'looking', 'something', 'even', 'minutely', 'rewarding', 'watch', 'more', 'once.Gary', 'Oldman', 'same', 'really', 'dedicated', 'drug', 'binge', 'carried', 'most', '90s', 'just', 'one', 'notch', 'too', 'high', 'possible', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'performance', 'would', 'scare', 'opted', 'play', 'top', 'was', 'probably', 'bad', 'idea', ""'d"", 'ratchet', 'up', 'even', 'further', '5th', 'Element.When', 'movie', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'many', 'reviewers', 'were', 'disturbed', 'relationship', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Others', 'tried', 'dismiss', 'claiming', 'was', 'familial', 'rather', 'romantic', 'sides', 'are', 'wrong', 'Leon', 'mind', 'child', 'Intellectually', 'emotionally', 'younger', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'character', 'relationship', 'puppy', 'love', 'romantic', 'limited', 'sense', 'puppy', 'love', 'can', 'be', 'nothing', 'morally', 'dangerous', 'here', 'no-one', 'going', 'be', 'corrupted', 'movie', 'except', 'insofar', 'might', 'lead', 'confuse', 'things', 'like', 'things', 'are', 'good']",N/A

So I was thrilled to see this Uncut version of it on DVD.  I finally got to see it this week and have mixed feelings about it.  The added footage (at least the footage I can disseminate as being added) is:GREAT because--It adds background history to Leon that gives depth to his character.  Something I was very much curious about.NOT SO GREAT because--1) I'm not sure Leon's character needed that much depth, given the scope/tone of the film's storytelling, 2) It presents *outright* the sexual tension between Leon and Mathilda that is nicely left *implied* in the so-called massacred US version, and finally, 3) The added minutes somehow screw up the pacing of the film.  I can't put a finger on why, how, or even where it happens-- but it just does.Don't get me wrong, I'm not some prude who can't take the relationship presented between the two main characters.  In fact, the tension is there even in the ""cut"" US version.  But stating it outright just forces a ""Lolita"" aspect to it that, for me, restricts to a single interpretation of the relationship, and the rest of the dialogue between the two characters.I still like the movie a lot.  I can't say more than what's already been said about Gary Oldman's performance.  I haven't seen Episode II, but I'd still be willing to guess that this *IS* Natalie Portman's best role to date.  And without giving away too much, Director Luc Besson's handling of what happens to Leon at the end is absolutely the best I've seen ANY director handle that type of ending-- moreso because it's done so well in an ""action flick.""Buy the Uncut International Version out of curiosity, and if you're a fan of the film.

5800,A19L7AXZWAWO95,0767802519,"Mehdi J. Pieloor ""Movie Geek and Book Guzzler""","[4, 4]","First, a word of warning: Don't mistake the bland US version (""The Professional"") with the genius of the original version (""Leon"").The backstory:Leon (Jean Reno) is a man with a past; having fled to America to avoid prosecution for killing the man who murdered his love (the upper-class father of the girl, who'd rather see his daughter dead than involved with the lower-class likes of Leon), he's taken under the wing by Tony (Danny Aiello), who cultivates the murderous tendencies of the young lad, and turns him into the best of the best: a lone, dedicated ""cleaner""; a professional hit man that knows no equal.Mathilda (Natalie Portman's movie debut) is the daughter of a small-time drug-pusher, who shares her life with her little brother (whom she dearly loves), her dad (who beats her), her stepmother (who doesn't care) and her half-sister (with a mutual dislike that borders to hate). The dysfunctional family life has turned the 12 year old girl old before her age, and what little love and care she has left in her is devoted to her little brother.The story of the movie:D.E.A. detective Stansfield (a deliciously over-the-top performance by Gary Oldman) runs a little side-business - pushing drugs (what else?); when Mathilda's father decides to make a bit of a profit by holding back some of the drugs Stansfield left in his care, he invites the wrath of the detective, who - in a blind rage - murders the entire family. Mathilda, who was sent shopping before Stansfield and his crew arrived, comes back to the apartment while the carnage is still going on, and turns to the only other person in the apartment building she knows: Leon.Reluctantly, he decides to let her into his apartment, and this is the start of an uncomfortable yet moving relationship between Leon, the lone cleaner, and Mathilda, the confused and angry little girl. It's a relationship that changes Leon's life profoundly, shakes him to the core of his very soul (a soul he'd denied having since having killed his one love's killer.)The difference between ""The Professional"" and ""Leon"" (contains spoilers!):""The Professional"" is the American cut, which misses 24 minutes of the story; the cut was made because it was felt (rightly so, judging by some of the other reviews) that the American audiences would be uncomfortable with the original cut. ""Leon"" starts with the hit man on an assignment, sent out to teach a small-time drug dealer a little lesson (missing in ""The Professional""); this scene is essential to introduce us to the man that is Leon the cleaner... an invisible force of violence that knows no mercy, with catlike moves and no qualms.After this, we're introduced to Mathilda and her family, and the crazy (addicted and furious) detective Stansfield; after the carnage, Mathilda flees into the arms of Leon, and a one-sided love story develops, with Mathilda growing incessantly devoted to the cleaner; besides her wish to avenge her little brother's meaningless death, she clings to Leon with a passion she hasn't yet learned how to deal with - and all the time, Leon rejects her attempts to either make him her lover or her teacher.When faced with her final rage and despair (another removed scene in ""The Professional"", where she holds a loaded gun to her head to drive the point through), he decides to at least meet her halfway... and because he can't love her the way she loves him, he offers her the next best thing, and the following cut (removed from ""The Professional"") shows Leon taking Mathilda out on his ""jobs""... her initial training as a cleaner.People who say that the original version is a perversion with pedophiliac tendencies haven't *seen* the cut... because even though Mathilda keeps pushing Leon towards her mistaken and misguided idea of love, Leon never gives in, except near the very end, where all he does is concede to lie next to her, to sleep, instead of sleeping in the armchair near his window. This is also the defining moment in Leon's life, where his soul-searching reaches an end... as one finds out in the tense and heartbreaking finale that follows immediately after.All in all, where ""The Professional"" is just a decent action movie, ""Leon"" actually has a well-defined story to it (and real character development), that has you sitting on the edge of your chair for 2 hours and 16 minutes, with the occasional burst of laughter (Luc Besson always manages to add some - albeit dark - humor into his movies.)",5,The Loneliness Of The Short Distance Cleaner,1230422400,"12 28, 2008",2008,4449,"['First', 'word', 'warning', 'Do', ""n't"", 'mistake', 'bland', 'US', 'version', 'Professional', 'genius', 'original', 'version', 'Leon', '.The', 'backstory', 'Leon', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'man', 'past', 'having', 'fled', 'America', 'avoid', 'prosecution', 'killing', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'love', 'upper-class', 'father', 'girl', 'who', ""'d"", 'rather', 'see', 'daughter', 'dead', 'involved', 'lower-class', 'likes', 'Leon', 'taken', 'wing', 'Tony', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'who', 'murderous', 'tendencies', 'young', 'lad', 'best', 'best', 'lone', 'dedicated', 'cleaner', 'professional', 'hit', 'man', 'equal.Mathilda', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'movie', 'debut', 'daughter', 'small-time', 'drug-pusher', 'who', 'shares', 'life', 'little', 'brother', 'whom', 'dearly', 'dad', 'who', 'stepmother', 'who', ""n't"", 'care', 'half-sister', 'mutual', 'dislike', 'hate', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'life', 'turned', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'old', 'age', 'what', 'little', 'love', 'care', 'left', 'devoted', 'little', 'brother.The', 'story', 'movie', 'D.E.A', 'detective', 'Stansfield', 'deliciously', 'over-the-top', 'performance', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'little', 'side-business', 'pushing', 'drugs', 'what', 'else', 'when', 'Mathilda', 'father', 'make', 'bit', 'profit', 'holding', 'back', 'drugs', 'Stansfield', 'left', 'care', 'wrath', 'detective', 'who', 'blind', 'rage', 'murders', 'entire', 'family', 'Mathilda', 'who', 'was', 'sent', 'shopping', 'Stansfield', 'crew', 'arrived', 'back', 'apartment', 'carnage', 'still', 'going', 'only', 'other', 'person', 'apartment', 'building', 'Leon.Reluctantly', 'let', 'apartment', 'start', 'uncomfortable', 'yet', 'moving', 'relationship', 'Leon', 'lone', 'cleaner', 'Mathilda', 'confused', 'angry', 'little', 'girl', 'relationship', 'Leon', 'life', 'profoundly', 'core', 'very', 'soul', 'soul', ""'d"", 'denied', 'having', 'having', 'killed', 'one', 'love', 'killer', 'difference', 'Professional', 'Leon', 'spoilers', 'Professional', 'American', 'cut', '24', 'minutes', 'story', 'cut', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'felt', 'rightly', 'so', 'judging', 'other', 'reviews', 'American', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'original', 'cut', 'Leon', 'hit', 'man', 'assignment', 'sent', 'out', 'teach', 'small-time', 'drug', 'little', 'lesson', 'missing', 'Professional', 'scene', 'essential', 'introduce', 'man', 'Leon', 'cleaner', 'invisible', 'force', 'violence', 'mercy', 'catlike', 'moves', 'qualms.After', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Mathilda', 'family', 'crazy', 'addicted', 'furious', 'detective', 'Stansfield', 'carnage', 'Mathilda', 'arms', 'Leon', 'one-sided', 'love', 'story', 'Mathilda', 'growing', 'incessantly', 'devoted', 'cleaner', 'wish', 'avenge', 'little', 'brother', 'meaningless', 'death', 'Leon', 'passion', ""n't"", 'yet', 'learned', 'how', 'deal', 'time', 'Leon', 'attempts', 'make', 'lover', 'teacher.When', 'faced', 'final', 'rage', 'despair', 'removed', 'scene', 'Professional', 'where', 'loaded', 'gun', 'head', 'drive', 'point', 'least', 'meet', 'halfway', 'ca', ""n't"", 'love', 'way', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'following', 'cut', 'removed', 'Professional', 'Leon', 'taking', 'Mathilda', 'out', 'jobs', 'initial', 'training', 'cleaner.People', 'who', 'say', 'original', 'version', 'perversion', 'pedophiliac', 'tendencies', 'have', ""n't"", '*seen*', 'cut', 'because', 'even', 'Mathilda', 'pushing', 'Leon', 'mistaken', 'misguided', 'idea', 'love', 'Leon', 'never', 'very', 'end', 'where', 'concede', 'lie', 'next', 'sleep', 'instead', 'sleeping', 'armchair', 'window', 'also', 'defining', 'moment', 'Leon', 'life', 'where', 'soul-searching', 'end', 'one', 'out', 'tense', 'heartbreaking', 'finale', 'immediately', 'after.All', 'where', 'Professional', 'just', 'decent', 'action', 'movie', 'Leon', 'actually', 'well-defined', 'story', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'sitting', 'edge', 'chair', '2', 'hours', '16', 'minutes', 'occasional', 'burst', 'laughter', 'Luc', 'Besson', 'always', 'add', 'albeit', 'dark', 'humor', 'movies']",N/A

Gary Oldman also delivers a fine performance as the corrupt DEA officer who murders Mathilde's(Portman's) family.  Jean Reno, however, stands out the most in this film.  What could probably be considered his breakthrough American performance, or at least on of his best to date, his role could not be filled by anyone better.The European extended version, called 'Leon: The Professional', not only delivers the same great movie, but it also adds an extra half hour to the movie over-all, extending the character development of Leon(Reno) and his origins in the circle of organized crime, the relationship of Mathilde and Leon, and just completely enhancing the movie overall.Exciting gunplay and excellent character development make this movie well worth the price of admission.

5807,A3ITF6QNR581AR,0767802519,Micheal O Mealoid,"[0, 1]","The Professional, known in Europe as &quot;Leon&quot;.Leon tells the story of a professional hit-man who, against his better judgement, saves the life of a twelve year old girl whose family have all been killed, and then he has to figure out what to do with her.  While this film has plenty of action, it's a lot more than just a shoot `em up type film - the main focus being on the relationship between Leon and the little girl, Matilda.Leon is an Italian hit-man who works on a freelance basis for a mafia figure.  However, neither Leon nor the mafia man are your usual Godfather types, instead they seem thoughtful, considerate and even gentle!  OK, they kill people for a living, but otherwise they seem quite nice.  Leon, especially, is a quiet, pensive, doesn't take offence easily (there's none of that phoney ""respect"" stuff going on).  Leon does his job, keeps to the rules (no women, no kids), and keeps himself to himself.Everything changes when a drugs deal in the apartment next to him goes wrong, and the family are all killed by a corrupt DEA officer, except for Matilda, who was on an errand for Leon, whom she had just befriended.  As she returns, she sees the mayhem in her apartment, and just walks right past and goes to Leon's door, as if it were her own.  After a long consideration, Leon answers, and so she is now with him.The main part of the film focuses on how they get on together, his life of order and predictability now gone, while she draws on his strength and stability, a strong father figure she never had.  She wants to learn the art of assassination so she can get the cop who killed her family, and Leon teaches her.  I can't describe too much more without giving the story away, but suffice to say there are plenty of moving scenes, and not a little shooting.The performances are superb, with Natalie Portman in her debut absolutely stealing the show as the sweet and precocious little girl who steals Leon's heart.  Jean Reno, in his first really big Hollywood role, is just right as the gravely voiced strong silent type, while Gary Oldman is very convincing as the manic bad cop who will stop at nothing (really, nothing!) to get Leon.  Everything about this film is good, the music, the dialogue, the cinematography, and especially the performances.  There are some lovely touches, such as Leon's love for milk and his plant, and the scene where Leon and Matilda play a game where they dress up as famous characters and the other has to guess who they are.By the end, you're shouting and cheering for Leon, and booing and hissing at Oldman.  Overall, this is a very engaging and poignant film, the kind you would watch again and again, and see more detail and nuances every time.  In my opinion, a must see.",5,The story of a soft hearted hit-man who saves a girl's life.,972259200,"10 23, 2000",2000,2750,"['Professional', 'known', 'Europe', 'quot', 'Leon', 'quot', 'story', 'professional', 'hit-man', 'who', 'better', 'judgement', 'life', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'family', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'then', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'film', 'plenty', 'action', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'shoot', 'em', 'up', 'type', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'being', 'relationship', 'Leon', 'little', 'girl', 'Matilda.Leon', 'Italian', 'hit-man', 'who', 'freelance', 'basis', 'mafia', 'figure', 'However', 'Leon', 'mafia', 'man', 'are', 'usual', 'Godfather', 'types', 'instead', 'seem', 'thoughtful', 'considerate', 'even', 'gentle', 'OK', 'kill', 'people', 'living', 'otherwise', 'seem', 'quite', 'nice', 'Leon', 'especially', 'quiet', 'pensive', ""n't"", 'take', 'offence', 'easily', 'none', 'phoney', 'respect', 'stuff', 'going', 'Leon', 'job', 'rules', 'women', 'kids', 'himself.Everything', 'changes', 'when', 'drugs', 'deal', 'apartment', 'next', 'wrong', 'family', 'are', 'killed', 'corrupt', 'DEA', 'officer', 'Matilda', 'who', 'was', 'errand', 'Leon', 'whom', 'had', 'just', 'befriended', 'mayhem', 'apartment', 'just', 'walks', 'right', 'past', 'Leon', 'door', 'were', 'own', 'long', 'consideration', 'Leon', 'answers', 'so', 'now', 'him.The', 'main', 'part', 'film', 'how', 'get', 'together', 'life', 'order', 'predictability', 'now', 'gone', 'strength', 'stability', 'strong', 'father', 'figure', 'never', 'had', 'learn', 'art', 'assassination', 'can', 'get', 'cop', 'who', 'killed', 'family', 'Leon', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'giving', 'story', 'away', 'suffice', 'say', 'are', 'plenty', 'moving', 'scenes', 'not', 'little', 'shooting.The', 'performances', 'are', 'superb', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'debut', 'absolutely', 'stealing', 'show', 'sweet', 'precocious', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Leon', 'heart', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'first', 'really', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'role', 'just', 'right', 'gravely', 'voiced', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'very', 'convincing', 'manic', 'bad', 'cop', 'who', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'really', 'nothing', 'get', 'Leon', 'Everything', 'film', 'good', 'music', 'dialogue', 'cinematography', 'especially', 'performances', 'are', 'lovely', 'touches', 'such', 'Leon', 'love', 'milk', 'plant', 'scene', 'where', 'Leon', 'Matilda', 'play', 'game', 'where', 'dress', 'up', 'as', 'famous', 'characters', 'other', 'guess', 'who', 'are.By', 'end', ""'re"", 'shouting', 'cheering', 'Leon', 'booing', 'hissing', 'Oldman', 'Overall', 'very', 'engaging', 'poignant', 'film', 'kind', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'see', 'more', 'detail', 'nuances', 'time', 'opinion', 'must', 'see']",N/A

She lives in an extremely disfunctional family, and her dad has ties with local drug boss Mr. Stansfield (played wonderfully by Gary Oldman). Stansfield and his crew show up and wipe out Matilda's entire family, which leaves her as the sole survivor. She manages to escape and goes to her next door neighbor Leon( Jean Reno)for help. At first, she just needs someone to look after her and a place to stay. But Matilda soon discovers that Leon is a professional hitman. The lifestyle soon appeals to Matilda, and she convinces Leon to teach her how to be a hitman, so that she can gain revenge on the men that killed her family...Luc Besson's &quot;Leon&quot; is one of the best movies available right now. The action sequences in this movie will blow your mind! They are intense and do not pull any punches. The story is absolutely oustanding. It is dramatic, funny, and so fast paced that you might get dizzy from watching it. The cast is great. This is Natalie Portman's first role, and she does an outstanding job. Also Gary Oldman plays one of the best villans that you can hope for. He is intelligent, cruel, sadistic, and just straight out of his mind. Danny Aiello does a nice job as the local mob boss that sets up Leon with his jobs and takes care of his finances. Last, but certainly not least there is Jean Reno as Leon the hitman. He is cold, calculated, and never misses the mark. Although Leon is a trained killer, you can't help but like the guy because he raises Matilda like she was his own daughter. Leon actually takes pride in teaching her how to be a hitman.&quot;Leon&quot; is flat out amazing and one of my all time favorite films. The performances, thrilling action sequences, and touching father/daughter relationship between Leon and Matilda will keep your heart pumping, and have you reaching for the kleenex as well.*WARNING - Make sure that you purchase THIS version of the film.

Of course, a 12 year-old girl parading around singing &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; is hihgly exploitive, but the story surrounding Leon's love for the young girl is mostly told sensitively.  The manipulative nature of the film attempts to make Leon seem like a &quot;good guy&quot;.  For instance, Leon can't possibly be bad if he watches musicals, drinks milk and has a plant for a best friend.  The fact that the first scenes show him brutally killing a group of gangsters detracts from this theory however.

Well it's nothing like Man on Fire, so I'll judge this movie as it stands on its own. It stands as well as any peg legged person would.The bond between Creasy and Pita was very believable, the bond between Leon and Mathilda is contrived and awkward. From the outset, I didn't buy that this little Mathilda girl has this burning passion and dedicated devotion to become a hit-man just like Leon. What little girl even thinks like that? Also, what makes her sooo interested in him anyway? I'm talking about before he rescued her, what was it about him that she was so attracted to? It makes no sense.Obviously if Mathilda didn't want to be a hit-man, we would have no movie. Had they justified this motivation in a more believable manner, I would've bought it. And no, her family being murdered (including her brother who she was close with) doesn't count. I don't buy ""becoming a hit-man"" as a believable emotional response for a 12 year old girl. If they wanted to make it realistic, they should've had her desire to be a hit-man be more of a passing interest, as sort of a passionate raw response to having her family murdered. A lot of kids show interest in whatever it is that is current in their minds at the time, but unless it's something that they are naturally interested in, or are forced to do, they probably won't follow through with the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in some random craft thrown at them (and why should they, you think you can get a 12 year old girl to all of a sudden show daily dedication in say, becoming a car mechanic, without any persuasion to do so?)Here's what they should've done: After her family is killed, have her still want to exact revenge, but what should change is her character's desire to *continue* training to be a hit-man, because that single flaw is what throws this whole premise off the balcony. I would have her eventually try to give up on this idea after realizing what a dark world she's gotten herself into, only to have Leon not allow her back out of her commitment. The manner in which Leon reacts to this and the degree to which he goes to prevent her cop out would be determined by how you would want to portray his character. There could be many interesting possibilities with this sort of idea, by showing a realistic shades of grey character.One final thing, so many people said how Gary Oldman was so great in this, and squealing with delight about how his quirky performance was just so wonderful. The man's FACE bothered me the entire movie. The way he played that character was very annoying, not to mention unrealistic to the type of disposition a person that made it to his position would have.",3,How is this better than Man on Fire?,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2790,"['watched', 'recommendation', 'was', 'similar', 'toMan', 'Fire', '2004', 'much', 'much', 'much', 'better', 'Well', 'nothing', 'Man', 'Fire', ""'ll"", 'judge', 'movie', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'peg', 'legged', 'person', 'would.The', 'bond', 'Creasy', 'Pita', 'was', 'very', 'believable', 'bond', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'contrived', 'awkward', 'outset', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'little', 'Mathilda', 'girl', 'burning', 'passion', 'dedicated', 'devotion', 'become', 'hit-man', 'just', 'Leon', 'What', 'little', 'girl', 'even', 'Also', 'what', 'sooo', 'interested', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'talking', 'rescued', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'so', 'attracted', 'sense.Obviously', 'Mathilda', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'hit-man', 'would', 'have', 'movie', 'Had', 'justified', 'motivation', 'more', 'believable', 'manner', 'would', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'family', 'being', 'murdered', 'including', 'brother', 'who', 'was', 'close', ""n't"", 'count', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'becoming', 'hit-man', 'believable', 'emotional', 'response', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'wanted', 'make', 'realistic', 'should', ""'ve"", 'had', 'desire', 'be', 'hit-man', 'be', 'more', 'passing', 'interest', 'sort', 'passionate', 'raw', 'response', 'having', 'family', 'murdered', 'lot', 'kids', 'show', 'interest', 'whatever', 'current', 'minds', 'time', 'something', 'are', 'naturally', 'interested', 'are', 'forced', 'do', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'follow', 'hard', 'work', 'dedication', 'succeed', 'random', 'craft', 'thrown', 'why', 'should', 'think', 'can', 'get', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'sudden', 'show', 'daily', 'dedication', 'say', 'becoming', 'car', 'mechanic', 'persuasion', 'do', 'so', 'Here', 'what', 'should', ""'ve"", 'done', 'family', 'killed', 'have', 'still', 'want', 'exact', 'revenge', 'what', 'should', 'change', 'character', 'desire', '*continue*', 'training', 'be', 'hit-man', 'single', 'flaw', 'what', 'whole', 'premise', 'balcony', 'would', 'have', 'eventually', 'try', 'give', 'up', 'idea', 'realizing', 'what', 'dark', 'world', 'gotten', 'only', 'have', 'Leon', 'not', 'allow', 'back', 'commitment', 'manner', 'Leon', 'degree', 'prevent', 'cop', 'out', 'would', 'be', 'determined', 'how', 'would', 'want', 'portray', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'many', 'interesting', 'possibilities', 'sort', 'idea', 'showing', 'realistic', 'shades', 'grey', 'character.One', 'final', 'thing', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'said', 'how', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'squealing', 'delight', 'how', 'quirky', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'wonderful', 'man', 'FACE', 'bothered', 'entire', 'movie', 'way', 'played', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'annoying', 'not', 'mention', 'unrealistic', 'type', 'disposition', 'person', 'made', 'position', 'would', 'have']",N/A

There are several problems with both the plot and theme of this movie which, taken together, make the film both unrealistic and perverse.First of all, there is nothing professional about the supposed professional hitman played by Jean Reno; as the character portrayed seems to suffer from retardation and ineptitude. An otherwise professional sociopath suddenly has a heart for a defenseless little girl? But it doesn't stop there. The relationship between Portman and Reno has strong sexual overtones which Besson intentionally emphasized by the mood of the dialogue and, most importantly, the very suggestive camera angles on Nataly Portman: the continuous angling of the camera on Portman's hips, waste, crotch, and rear, makes this theme all too clear. The movie therefore presents pedophilic sentiments as normal and legitimate. Sorry, but a film on the lustful woes of a 40+ year old deranged assassin for a young 10-12 year old girl isn't worth a second look. The best performance in the film is by Gary Oldman who plays the corrupt police officer.Altogether a pretentious film that, due to its perverted theme, has absolutely no redeeming value.

What I didn't know was there was a directors extended cut for this movie. This extended version was what they were playing in the store and one scene where the little girl puts a gun to her head for a game of russian roulette blew me away. I had to buy it ASAP!I had no idea Natalie Portman was that little girl in The Professional. I only know of her from Star Wars and Garden State. Now I know why she became a star and understand why I loved her in the V for Vendetta movie. She was made for roles like these.Between Portman, Jean & Oldham the acting & chemistry is superb and they all deserve Oscars!ONE NOTE: The original USA release cuts out the important and exciting bits that makes this movie superb. Which is why I forgot about it to begin with because the 1994 USA release is boring and borders on being a Disney themed movie.The Directors Extended Cut is far better to watch. The extra minutes alone are worth the entire weight of the film. It also improves the pacing since the USA version seemed to rush thru scene to scene to get to the climax as quick as possible without dwelling on the weirdness of Mathilda's love for Leon-this version focused on the making the relationship between Leon and Mathilda seem platonic and safe and fun and Disney-like.The director's cut put all that on the backseat and focus on the action and story around Mathilda's training and coming of age as a young hitman. This story version is way better and more interesting to follow than watching the USA Disney version.I'm surprised they have not been any sequels to this movie.

The Professional is a love story, surrounded by wonderful characters  and the violence they introduce into a young girls life.  By the way, the young girl, played by Natalie Portman, is perfect in this film.  When I bought this DVD, I was excited to see the additional 24 minutes of footage.  I popped the DVD into my player and was impressed by the simple, yet beautiful menu design.  You click, there is an explosion, and you arrive at your destination!  Your audio choices are between a 2-Track Dolby Digital for simple 2 speaker set-ups and a 5.1 Track Dolby Digital for advanced systems.  Either way, this DVD is a beautiful audio experience.  Stereo spearation and ambiance are wondeful to listen to.  Vocals are clean and clear, and the deep bass will definitely test your speaker system.  The widescreen picture was VERY impressive.  Colors are beautiful and the picture is clean and beautifully rendered.  The inclusion of the 24 minutes was fun to watch and flawlessly fits itself into the American version that we already know.  In one way, I'm not sure why these deleted scenes were not part of the American release, but on the other hand, they really weren't necessary to the film.  Some may say it slows the pace down, while others may say the deleted scenes include things not appropriate for some viewers.....either way, I enjoyed seeing them simply because I love viewing deleted scenes.  The package also included the trailers and the international ad campaign.  This is a great disc to own.  The film is great, and the picture and sound quality is fantastic.

I feel Ms Portman and Mr. Reno turn in superb performances throughout the movie.  The straightforward depiction of the romantic interest of a 12-year old girl - an age where many girls start going through something like that - for a much older man, and the way that affects Leon as well as the way he handles it (very much the moral high-ground though he is obviously emotionally impacted) is well and tastefully done.  So in addition to the intrinsic value of seeing more of Natalie Portman, to repeat, the additional scenes flesh out the movie and make an even better movie out of an already excellent one.  I highly recommend this uncut version.  It is well worth purchasing even if one already owns the cut version.

I  bought the VHS a few years back without ever even hearing about the film,  and loved it.  It will remain apart of my VHS collection forever.  Now as  for the uncut international version:1. The added scenes make the film  much more enjoyable to watch.  It gives the story a plot; I'm not saying  the VHS version doesn't have a plot, but that it answers questions that you  may not have even had.  Two thumbs up, and why wasn't this version also  released in the United States? Hmmmmmmmm.2. It's a whole different movie  than from the version you've seen before.5 out of 5.  Two thumbs up.  What more can you ask for?Leon vs. Luca.  Another great and eccentric  hitman is Luca from The Godfather.  I'm not saying that Leon is the same  kind of movie as The Godfather, but rather that the characters are very  much alike.  If you've seen The godfather movies you may or may not  recognize the simularities, but if you'd read the book then you've realized  that the characters are very comparable.  They both have very odd or  eccentric characteristics.  Leon only drinks milk, sleeps sitting up, lives  well below his means, and his only friend is a plant.  Luca has no friends  and also lives well below his means...actually they have a lot more in  common of which I realize I shouldn't be giving away because I don't want  to ruin the movie for those who have not seen it.Hey, I've always wished  that they put more of Luca in The Godfather, but that movie was about the  Corleones.  This is not.  It is only about a hitman.  How can someone kill  for a living?  What kind of an individual would do this?  What kind of a  father would a hitman make?  Do they even have feelings?

Leon, a professional assassin, saves the life of Matilda and takes her in and begins to care for her. While their relationship can be seen as father / daughter relationship at the start, you can slowly see it morph into something much more. Many of the additional scenes in this version were taken out of the theatrical release simply because the studio didn't think an American audience could swallow the relationship that Leon and Matilda develop over the course of the film. Whereas the original does show them growing closer as the film progresses, this version digs even deeper. It shows how deeply flawed Matilda is and eventually reveals how broken she's become. It also shows why she begins to feel the way she does for Leon and how he deals with it in such a lovely way. I do not want to spoil too much of the additional footage, but if you cannot keep an open mind while watching this film, perhaps you should just skip it.I thoroughly enjoyed the original release, but this version goes beyond anything I could have hoped for.

5864,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,0767802519,Robert Morris,"[11, 12]","By accident, I stumbled upon this film while channel surfing one evening and watched it on television. Only later did I learn that its producer, director, and screenwriter (Luc Bresson) was also the driving force behind La Femme Nikita (1990) which I had already seen. There are several reasons why I find this film so fascinating. First, Jean Reno's Leon is thoroughly professional when completing his paid assignments as an assassin but proves emotionally vulnerable to his 12-year old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman) when she suddenly has neither a family nor a home. Leon takes her in and, over time, she overcomes his reluctance to accept her as his apprentice. Obviously, she feels the need for formal training so she can avenge the loss of her family but also, I think, because she realizes that in the world she surveys, she must be able to protect herself against various enemies such as DEA supervisor Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her chief antagonist. His psychotic personality and violent behavior are at least partly explained by his dependence on drugs, of course, but also because he is determined to eliminate any and all threats to his professional authority and personal safety. To me, the most menacing person in the film, however, is mob boss Tony (Danny Aiello) who supervises Leon's assignments while carefully maintaining a public persona as affable merchant and devoted family man. When street smart Mathilda approaches him near the end of the film, she immediately recognizes his evil nature.I also enjoyed the series of scenes in which Leon demonstrates his highly-developed professional skills. As in La Femme Nikita, Bresson effectively juxtaposes violence with sometimes unexpected tenderness. Those with a strong appetite for symbolism will probably have much to say about the potted tree plant which accompanies Mathilda and Leon from one residence to the next. I think it is a nice touch but not of major significance. I find it difficult to believe that this is Portman's first film, given the texture and nuances of her performance. Reno is superb throughout. Oldman probably had the most difficult role and is wholly credible as the corrupt DEA official. With regard to the film's conclusion, I commend Bresson for not tying up all the loose ends. Questions remain. For example, given all that has happened to Mathilda throughout the course of the film, what are her options now? Is she adequately prepared to cope with whatever may lie ahead? It would be interesting to check in on her at age 25 or 30. In the meanwhile, we can only speculate on the answers to such questions...and we'd probably be wrong.",5,The Director's Cut Is Even Better,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,2642,"['accident', 'stumbled', 'film', 'channel', 'surfing', 'one', 'evening', 'watched', 'television', 'Only', 'later', 'did', 'learn', 'producer', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'Luc', 'Bresson', 'was', 'also', 'driving', 'force', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', '1990', 'had', 'already', 'seen', 'are', 'several', 'reasons', 'why', 'find', 'film', 'so', 'fascinating', 'First', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'Leon', 'thoroughly', 'professional', 'when', 'completing', 'paid', 'assignments', 'assassin', 'emotionally', 'vulnerable', '12-year', 'old', 'neighbor', 'Mathilda', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'when', 'suddenly', 'family', 'home', 'Leon', 'time', 'reluctance', 'accept', 'apprentice', 'Obviously', 'need', 'formal', 'training', 'can', 'avenge', 'loss', 'family', 'also', 'think', 'world', 'surveys', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'protect', 'various', 'enemies', 'such', 'DEA', 'supervisor', 'Stansfield', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'psychotic', 'personality', 'violent', 'behavior', 'are', 'least', 'partly', 'explained', 'dependence', 'drugs', 'course', 'also', 'determined', 'eliminate', 'threats', 'professional', 'authority', 'personal', 'safety', 'most', 'menacing', 'person', 'film', 'however', 'mob', 'boss', 'Tony', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'who', 'Leon', 'assignments', 'carefully', 'maintaining', 'public', 'persona', 'affable', 'merchant', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'When', 'street', 'smart', 'Mathilda', 'end', 'film', 'immediately', 'evil', 'nature.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'scenes', 'Leon', 'highly-developed', 'professional', 'skills', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'Bresson', 'effectively', 'violence', 'sometimes', 'unexpected', 'tenderness', 'strong', 'appetite', 'symbolism', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'much', 'say', 'potted', 'tree', 'plant', 'Mathilda', 'Leon', 'one', 'residence', 'next', 'think', 'nice', 'touch', 'not', 'major', 'significance', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'Portman', 'first', 'film', 'given', 'texture', 'nuances', 'performance', 'Reno', 'superb', 'Oldman', 'probably', 'had', 'most', 'difficult', 'role', 'wholly', 'credible', 'corrupt', 'DEA', 'official', 'regard', 'film', 'conclusion', 'commend', 'Bresson', 'not', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'Questions', 'remain', 'example', 'given', 'happened', 'Mathilda', 'course', 'film', 'what', 'are', 'options', 'now', 'adequately', 'prepared', 'cope', 'may', 'lie', 'ahead', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'check', 'age', '25', '30', 'meanwhile', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'answers', 'such', 'questions', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'wrong']",N/A

5867,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0767802519,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 3]","In ""The Professional"", Leon (Jean Reno) is a hit man who can go anywhere and kill people without drawing a single bullet. He specializes in walking (almost as if out of walls or thin air)right up to his victims before the killing blow. Nothing about Leon explains why he is so singularly sucessful at the art of breaking, entering and killing and when off duty, we learn that his life is simply a slower version of the death he inflicts on others. He lives in a crumbling Manhattan apartment, sleeping upright and wearing Reno's trademark sunglasses. He has no friends or family and his life boils down to catching old movies in revival houses and caring for his plant. Tony (Danny Aiello), Leon's only contact with the outside world, is also his ""agent"". When Leon's neighbors are almost entirely killed by a squad of crooked cops led by the thoroughly evil Detective Stansfield (over the top Gary Oldman), the sole survivor of the murdered family, Mathilda (Natalie Portman) runs to Leon for help.  Free of both her family and apparently feeling secure from their killers, Mathilda is doubly over-joyed to learn of Leon's special career, and nurtures her own budding dreams of revenge. The two reach an understanding - Mathilda will keep house while Leon trains her in the art of murder. Leon starts her off with a sniper-rifle, educating her on the ethos of assassination - in which expertise is measured by your proximity to your target. (You start with the rifle, but master the art with a knife.) On a deeper level, Leon gives Mathilda something to live for while Mathilda gives Leon somebody to live with. In one classic scene, the two play charades - neither of the two capable of reaching imagery the other can readily understand until Mathilda does Chaplin. Life appears idyllic, considering Leon's bleak surroundings, but that doesn't last long. Probably hoping to wean Mathilda from her dreams of revenge, Leon restrains her impulses, but apparently not enough. When Mathilda goes looking for Stansfield, he ensnares her.  Unfortunately, Leon rescues her the only way he knows how - by executing her captors. With the multiple execution of rogue officers by a mysterious Italian hitman who walks right up to his victims coupled with the realization that Mathilda is still alive, Stansfield realizes that he's left unfinished business. Leon, once the hunter, is now the prey.""The Professional"" is sort of an art-house action flick, like ""La Femme Nikita"" (which also had Jean Reno playing a hired killer), though it gets very slow in the middle, and even the climax is too long drawn out to speed things up. (commercials for this flick had a shot of a tear-gas rocket in flight across a hallway quickly cuts to a mammoth pillar of fire blowing out the front entrance of Leon's building; two events are really separate, and the action is actually slow in the final blow-out). Natalie Portman is haunting as Mathilda, but she clues us in that something is wrong with her before her family is gunned down (she wears trashy clothes and cuts classes; when intercepting a call from school, Mathilda answers back that she's been killed). Still, the film works on the bond that the childlike Leon forges with the pre-adolescent Mathilda, underscoring a poignant closing.",3,Hitman and survivor join forces - not an action movie,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",2002,3273,"['Professional', 'Leon', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'hit', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'anywhere', 'kill', 'people', 'drawing', 'single', 'bullet', 'walking', 'almost', 'walls', 'thin', 'air', 'right', 'up', 'victims', 'killing', 'blow', 'Nothing', 'Leon', 'why', 'so', 'singularly', 'sucessful', 'art', 'breaking', 'entering', 'killing', 'when', 'off', 'duty', 'learn', 'life', 'simply', 'slower', 'version', 'death', 'others', 'crumbling', 'Manhattan', 'apartment', 'sleeping', 'upright', 'wearing', 'Reno', 'trademark', 'sunglasses', 'friends', 'family', 'life', 'down', 'catching', 'old', 'movies', 'revival', 'houses', 'caring', 'plant', 'Tony', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Leon', 'only', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'also', 'agent', 'When', 'Leon', 'neighbors', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'killed', 'squad', 'crooked', 'cops', 'led', 'thoroughly', 'evil', 'Detective', 'Stansfield', 'top', 'Gary', 'Oldman', 'sole', 'survivor', 'murdered', 'family', 'Mathilda', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Leon', 'help', 'Free', 'family', 'apparently', 'feeling', 'secure', 'killers', 'Mathilda', 'doubly', 'over-joyed', 'learn', 'Leon', 'special', 'career', 'own', 'budding', 'dreams', 'revenge', 'two', 'reach', 'understanding', 'Mathilda', 'will', 'keep', 'house', 'Leon', 'art', 'murder', 'Leon', 'off', 'sniper-rifle', 'educating', 'ethos', 'assassination', 'expertise', 'measured', 'proximity', 'target', 'start', 'rifle', 'master', 'art', 'knife', 'deeper', 'level', 'Leon', 'Mathilda', 'something', 'live', 'Mathilda', 'Leon', 'somebody', 'live', 'one', 'classic', 'scene', 'two', 'play', 'charades', 'two', 'capable', 'reaching', 'imagery', 'other', 'can', 'readily', 'understand', 'Mathilda', 'Chaplin', 'Life', 'idyllic', 'considering', 'Leon', 'bleak', 'surroundings', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Probably', 'hoping', 'wean', 'Mathilda', 'dreams', 'revenge', 'Leon', 'impulses', 'apparently', 'not', 'enough', 'When', 'Mathilda', 'looking', 'Stansfield', 'Unfortunately', 'Leon', 'only', 'way', 'how', 'executing', 'captors', 'multiple', 'execution', 'rogue', 'officers', 'mysterious', 'Italian', 'hitman', 'who', 'walks', 'right', 'up', 'victims', 'coupled', 'realization', 'Mathilda', 'still', 'alive', 'Stansfield', 'left', 'unfinished', 'business', 'Leon', 'once', 'hunter', 'now', 'prey', 'Professional', 'sort', 'art-house', 'action', 'flick', 'La', 'Femme', 'Nikita', 'also', 'had', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'playing', 'hired', 'killer', 'very', 'slow', 'middle', 'even', 'climax', 'too', 'long', 'drawn', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'commercials', 'flick', 'had', 'shot', 'tear-gas', 'rocket', 'flight', 'hallway', 'quickly', 'mammoth', 'pillar', 'fire', 'blowing', 'out', 'front', 'entrance', 'Leon', 'building', 'two', 'events', 'are', 'really', 'separate', 'action', 'actually', 'slow', 'final', 'blow-out', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'haunting', 'Mathilda', 'something', 'wrong', 'family', 'gunned', 'down', 'trashy', 'clothes', 'cuts', 'classes', 'when', 'intercepting', 'call', 'school', 'Mathilda', 'back', 'been', 'killed', 'Still', 'film', 'bond', 'childlike', 'Leon', 'pre-adolescent', 'Mathilda', 'underscoring', 'poignant', 'closing']",N/A

Looking at his apperence, it looks lke he's been doing this for a real long time.

5878,A13IKSGDYNBNQS,0767802519,S J Buck,"[3, 3]","Luc Bessons Leon is a spellbinding story of a Hitman and a young girl. The hitman 'Leon' is played by Jean Reno and 'Matilda' by Natalie Portman. Both are brilliant. The other major role in the film goes to Gary Oldman as the corrupt and psychotic Policeman 'Stansfield'. Oldman is typically over the top, but in this film it felt right.The detail of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is left implied but unstated directly. It may be sexual, despite Matilda being underage, but somehow you accept that their relationship works. Although Matilda is the innocent because of her age (12), Leon appears on some level to be an innocent or simpleton as well. He is a deadly hitman, but he is being ripped off by the man who organises the jobs for him, and I never got the impression that he had a grip on anything other than how to kill people.This is all done beautifully. Scene after scene will stay with you: The opening where Leon goes to visit the 'Fatman'. The early rampage by 'Stansfield' at the apartment when Matildas father is in trouble over drugs. The scene in the toilet at the Police Station. I could list a dozen memorable scenes quite easily.One thing worth mentioning is that although a lot of bullets fly during this film, there are really no special effects, and yet it is effortlessly more entertaining than say Mission Impossible III (a random pick of a recent blockbuster) which is full of CGI effects and explosions.

So imagine my excitement when I picked up my copy of the Deluxe Edition. It was a joy to see the interviews with the cast, especially some of the casting outtakes of Natalie Portman. Her masterful acting is without a doubt the driving force of the movie and I can't fathom anybody else playing the role of Mathilda. But the draw of the dvd is the extra footage, which doesn't disappoint. We get to see Leon show Mathilda the ropes of the Professional business and a touching scene when Leon uses some of his money from Tony to take Mathilda out to a fancy restaurant. There are some instances where it's easy to see why some footage was cut. In one part Mathilda offers to lose her virginity to Leon. I thought this was pushing their relationship in the wrong direction. I guess Luc thought so also and cut it from the final product. A downside to to losing that scene is that we see that Leon refuses her and gives us a glimse into his past and why he came to the U.S. Everyone involved in this film was amazing, from Luc to Natalie to Jean to Gary. The cut and uncut versions of the film are great additions to any DVD collection but I'd recommend this version because it's the way Luc intended it to be.

In other matters he's almost like a child. He can't read or write and he barely has enough skills to look after himself. He lives in an apartment building and hides away when he's not on a job.Leon's neighbors include 12-year-old Mathilda (Portman), who lives with her drug-dealing father. When a corrupt cop (Oldman) murders her father and the rest of the family, Mathilda turns to Leon for help. This is where things start to get interesting. Although she's 12, Mathilda has more of an idea of how to survive in the real world than Leon. She offers to take care of him in return for protection and shelter. She also wants to learn how to kill people.The premise is so unlikely, but it works. Leon teaches Mathilda the tricks of his trade. Some might find it inappropriate to watch a 12-year-old girl dealing with material of this nature, but Portman is superb in her first full-length feature. The two develop believable chemistry and love each other in some ways. The only other thing that Leon cares about is his beloved potted plant. The two are continually on the move to stay safe, so it's not much of a life for a young girl.The movie works because of the strong relationship between Leon and Mathilda. It's interesting to watch her train and see the bond deepening between the two. Revenge is always on her mind and she tries to persuade Leon to kill the men responsible for murdering her family. The final showdown is intense and contains a lot of action for fans of that genre. But, unlike many action movies, we feel as if we know the main characters and we genuinely care what happens to them.The Blu-ray contains the original 109-minute theatrical version and the extended 133-minute version.

But I am getting ahead of myself...Matilda's (Portman)entire family is wiped out by crooked lawman Stansfield, played chillingly by Gary Oldman, over drugs. No, Matilda didn't exactly have a great home life in that little apartment, but they killed her little brother, and this drives the young girl's thirst for revenge. Her own life is spared by a neighbor, Leon (Reno), when he lets her into his apartment as the carnage ends a few doors down. Leon is a simple, practical, clean living cleaner, or hit man.  He and his plant live a quiet and necessarily lonely existence.Matilida steals Leon's heart, however, and eventually, she convinces him to teach her the tricks of his trade. Their relationship is delightful to watch. The chemistry between the two actors and characters is the most natural I have seen in cinema. Matilda falls in love with the man, and though there are scenes in this movie that border on the disturbing, Leon never treats her as anything other than a daughter - a daughter that he loves and respects with all that he is.  There is nothing sordid in this relationship, though as Matilda, Portman pushes the envelope just enough to make us hold our breath. Aside from that, Natalie Portman outright shines. Most actors and actresses struggle to be taken seriously in their trade for many years. Portman gets much deserved respect as a serious actress with this film alone...and at 12 years old.Leon is complex in his simplicity. He is not the stereotypical Hollywood hit man in that he is some pretty, bad-boy with a Dentyne gleam smile for the camera and witty one liners. He is portrayed as a very real person who lives his his life as he does out of necessity because of what he does. And he does his job well, but it is a job and that is not all that defines him as we get to know him, and he opens himself up to a profound relationship with this child. He is bewildered by Matilda, and this is hilariously played out in the scene where they are playing charades. Leon has a big heart, and despite his teaching a child how to effectively kill people, you have no choice but to love him.Gary Oldman delivers a notable performance. Some might argue that it was over the top, but he was amazing. Killing people, popping pills, sweating profusely through cold and clever dialogue, the guy is truly scary. He is honestly the stuff of nightmares, and manages to steal several scenes. He is evil personified.This is one of the best movies ever made.

This is a perfect example of how a director's original vision can make the theatrical cut pale in comparison. Even though I must admit that I can understand why the cuts in the film were made, at the very least they weren't lost forever.

I think talking about the extra additions to this film in detail could ruin the viewing experience so I'll leave it untainted for the first time viewer. I will say that if you haven't seen this version and you liked the thetarical version, you should make it a point to.Technically, this disc is solid on both audio and video. I believe the transfer is the exact same one as the Superbit release and the audio gets a DTS 5.1 track as well, so no complaints there. The special features aren't as in depth as I would've liked, with no input by Gary Oldman at all.

I don't care what anyone says this movie is near flawless!  Jean Reno plays a expert hitman, named Leon, working in the mean streets of  NYC, who just loves his milk. The apartment building where Leon lives is  co-habitated by some other interesting characters. Namely a young girl  named Mathilda, played fantastically by Natalie Portman in her screen  debut. Little Mathilda, unfortunately lives with her abusive sister,  neglective mother, innocent young brother, and drug dealer father. When her  father crosses a drug lord, played by Gary Oldman(Is there a better bad guy  alive than him! ), the drug lord murders Mathilda's family, including  her toddler brother. Leno witnesses the act, and decides to take the girl  into his life. She soon learns of his trade as a &quot;cleaner&quot;, and  demands that Leon teach her how to &quot;clean&quot; so that she may avenge  the death of her younger brother. Leon reluctantly agrees, and soon the two  are caught up in a situation so deep that will change their lives forever.  The film is scored brilliantly by Eric Serra, and Luc Besson moves this  compelling tale at break neck speed, whilst all th ewhile not forgetting to  mix in humor, drama, and some pretty spectacular action scenes. My personal  favorite is when Leon attacks the NYPD SWAT team by hanging upside down  from the ceiling. The development of the two characters during thi  smagnificent ride is quite touching, as Leon goes from a temporary savior,  to a reluctant guardian, to a father type figure. There was even a spot  where Leon is trying to get the girl to escape, and she won't go because he  can't follow, that almost had me in tears. This is a great film, and it  should defintely be worth your time. At the very least, see it for Gary  Oldman's show-stealing performance. This guy should own several Oscars in  my book!

Jean Reno plays Leon the hitman who looks like a silly,  man who has no intelligence. Well, that is partly true due to illiteracy. His neighbor in the shallow apartment building which he resides has just witnessed the murders of her family. He takes the young Matilda (way too cute Natalie Portman) and they build a father-daughter relationship that they never had. I was crying so hard when Matilda dressed up and Leon had to play charades with her. It was heartfelt, tears rolling down my face. When corrupt police officers looked for them, he decided to wipe out all of them. Toughage! He was at the top of his doorframe and hung upside-down to blow them away. Yes! Even his plant made it through the massacre. But, the ending is devastating and will leave you in a crying coma for months. Natalie Portman had to go on without Leon and she lived off of twenty dollars. How resourceful! I loved this movie and everything about it.

Leon, or The Professional as it was called in America, is easily Besson's best. As good as Nikita was Leon is better, with better actors and most importantly...a better plot.Jean Reno is Leon, a stylish French hitman. Amidst the chaos of New York, Leon finds a source of peace in himself, and no one else. That is until a girl named Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) walks into his life...or rather stumbles. Mathilda's father is in a degree of drug trouble with the bentest cop you will ever meet, the superb Gary Oldman. Mathilda never really liked her family, except for her four year old brother. Oldman is searching for a stash of drugs which Mathilda's father has hidden, his form of searching is to blow away the whole family, then search. A hands on approach that works. Until Leon gets involved. Mathilda is out getting groceries, when she comes back she has no choice but to go to Leon, who lets her in his flat. Mathilda is taught how to kill by Leon, and plans to kill the bent cops as revenge for her little brother.The relationship between Mathilda and Leon is fascinating. Mathilda claims she has fallen in love with him, despite an age difference of about twenty five years. Leon shrugs it aside. But there are awkward moments where you sense a connection between the two. Something completely unnatural, and would probably be considered child abuse if anything happened. But...it's there...and unavoidable. Don't worry, they never go where your thinking but it's still a very complex idea brought forward by Besson. Is it that unnatural?The film contains some exciting action scenes, and its always a treat seeing how a good hitman works. How he deceives his opponent, out-thinks and out-manoeuvres. Reno is very convincing, with his heavy French accent, and cool shades, its perfection. The cast in general is perfect, Oldman is the obvious star, and I am yet to see him so psychopathic in any other film.I would recommend Leon to absolutely anyone. The plot is simple but intriguing, the relationships bordering the inhumane, the action is fast paced and gets the adrenalin moving, best of all the acting is stellar.

He's an odd actor and he's done his share of odd films, but none has touched me as deeply as ""The Professional"" which marked the film debut of Natalie Portman as a young girl who escapes the slaughter of her entire family by taking refuge with a hitman. (Reno)Mathilda's family life is less than ideal.  Her father is a drug-dealer, her mother is pretty much indifferent to the family and her older sister is a bully and a fool.  The only family member Mathilda can connect to is her little brother.  Outside of her family she also connects, or wants to connect, to L&eacute;on the stranger who lives down the hall, on whom she practices the few feminine wiles she's managed to pick up, not that L&eacute;on notices.  However, when a group of crooked cops murder everyone in Mathilda's family while she's out getting groceries, L&eacute;on is the only one she can turn to for help.  With incredible presence of mind she walks past the bloody scene in her apartment and rings his bell, and from that moment on he becomes her family. Mathilda wants to learn from L&eacute;on, she wants him to teach her how to become a ""cleaner"" so that she can take her revenge on the cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman giving one of the more bizarre performances of his career) and his men.  And because Mathilda is thirteen going on thirty-five, and knows how to get a point across, L&eacute;on eventually agrees.The central focus of this film is the relationship that blooms between them.  It's not that of a father and daughter, nor is there anything avuncular about the way L&eacute;on treats Mathilda.  There's an element of teacher/student here, and perhaps even something of a brother/sister feeling, but underneath everything there is a kind of impossible longing between these two people which the wise-beyond-her-years Mathilda eventually verbalizes when she announces to L&eacute;on that she is in love with him.  And L&eacute;on, who doesn't begin to understand women of any age, (he had to leave Italy because of woman trouble) is stunned.  He doesn't know what to think or what to do about this child-woman he's now stuck with. But of course her age makes anything more impossible, and eventually dooms them to be parted.  It's in this parting, which takes place in a blaze of gunfire that you understand that they understand their feelings for each other, that what they feel is the love of equals.""The Professional"" is a profoundly moving film because the love L&eacute;on and Mathilda feel for each other is so transcendent and so completely doomed from the start.  There is nothing prurient here, nothing done for titillation or shock value, but rather there is a bittersweet acceptance that there simply are connections which cannot flourish along socially acceptable lines.  I cry buckets over the ending every time I see it.

This is the first American movie by Luc Besson that stars Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman and they all give award winning performances.  The story is about a French hit man, brilliantly paid by Jean Reno (Ronin, Mission Impossible, French Kiss) who moves without a sound, kills without emotion and disappears without a glimmer who ends up taking care of a little girl played by Natalie Portman.  Natalie&#65533;s character Matilda&#65533;s family is killed by a corrupt DEA cop played incredibly by Gary Oldman.  Gary plays the role so well; it makes you wonder about him.  All kidding aside, Gary Oldman is an incredible actor and this movie proves it.The story of the movie revolves around Matilda wanting to get revenge on the killer of her younger brother, the corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman) and the interesting relationship forming between Leon (Jean Reno) and Matilda (Natalie Portman).  This is not your atypical action movie &#65533; Luc Besson does a great job where you will be laughing one minute and cheering on the anti-hero Leon as he&#65533;s blowing away some drug dealers.

5908,AWJC2DP07N5ZM,0767802519,"Vladimir Moya ""Vlad""","[5, 5]","This DVD Leon is the original version of The Professional. The Professional is often seen on American cable tv. However this version was only shown to international audiences because some of the material, particularly the relationship between a 13 year old girl and 40 something year old man, would be objectional to uptight American audiences.The story starts by introducing us to Leon as he takes a ""cleaning"" job from his boss, a fat Italian Don working out of a small restaurant in Little Italy. In the first job that we see Leon perform; Leon expertly wipes out an entire drug gang using a variety of lethal methods. He scares the drug lord senseless and forces him out of town. Then we learn that as great as Leon is as a hitman he seems to lead a very lonely life. He lives alone in a small NY apartment building. He always wears a coat because he is armed to the teeth with guns, grenades and other explosive goodies. He sleeps sitting down fully dressed because he fears reprisals. His only companion is a plant that he dotes on lovingly. He leads a clean life as he exercises religously and constantly drinks milk. Leon interacts with Mathilda, a neighboring teen who lives unhappily with her family. Mathilda's father is contracted by crooked DEA agents to hold bags of pure cocaine for them. Unfortunately for Mathilda's Dad he puts his hand in the cookie...er coke jar. This leads the DEA agents to come back and get their coke. This crooked group of DEA agents is led by a drugged up nut named Stansfield(played to the hilt by Gary Oldman). Stansfield loves Beethoven, drugs and guns. In a great scene Oldman dopes himself up with a funny-looking green/yellow capsule then proceeds to go ballistic on Mathilda's family; shooting Mom as she lays in a bubble bath, blowing Big Sis away as she runs screaming down the hall and even blowing away Baby Brother. The catch here is that Mathilda has gone to the store and is away as her family is being executed. Upon Mathilda's return she sees that her family has been whacked and knows that she is next if she doesn't think fast. So she knocks on Leon's neighboring door. After much waiting, Leon opens the door saving the girl's life.The movie then shifts to the relationship between the illiterate 40 something hitman Leon and the smart 13 year old budding beauty Mathilda. The actors Jean Reno and Natalie Poortman in her debut do a fantastic job of creating a relationship that is sweet innocent yet sexily forbidden. Here is where the International DVD ""Leon"" differs from the American version ""The Professional"". Leon gives the viewer 24 minutes of footage that was part of the original version. These 24 minutes give us more detail on the relationship and how Mathilda pushes Leon to be intimate with her yet Leon can not due to his past and also his guilt. It is a sad tale of a great love that can never be consumated.In the conclusion, Stansfield reappears and is determined to get Leon and Mathilda. The conclusion is all explosions and bullets but the viewer is left with the memory of the love story between Mathilda and Leon.

5910,AHTEDRC5XLKK0,0767802519,"WebViking ""WebViking""","[2, 2]","This movie was Luc Besson's first English film.  Set in modern day New York, it's the story of Leon, played well by Jean Reno, who is a professional hitman working for an Tony, an Italian mobster played by Danny Aiello.  The movie opens with Leon being given instructions by Tony, to track down a rival mobster and force him to talk to Tony.  In an phenomenally action-packed sequence, Leon manages to force the rival to talk to Tony on the phone.  Really, this first sequence alone is almost worth the price of admission, it's that well done.  Besson is certainly in his element when it comes to directing intense action packed sequences.The movies continues in this vein as Leon arrives home to see his neighbor being threatened a gang of thugs that turns out to be a group of DEA agents led by Norman Stansfield, played wonderfully by Gary Oldman.  Oldman is brilliant in the role of the twisted DEA agent with a bloody streak.  The next day, when Oldman and his corrupt band of DEA agents come back and wreak vengeance on the whole family, Leon reluctantly saves Mathilda from the bloodbath and basically ends up with an adopted daughter.  Leon and Mathilda are both fractured people emotionally.  Mathilda had been at least physically abused by both her father, step-mother and step-sister.  Leon was apparently brought from the old country as an illiterate immigrant and trained as ""a cleaner"".  It's obvious that his boss, Tony, is taking advantage of him, and Leon is unable to do much about it.  But in any case Mathilda and Leon form a bond, which makes some sense given the circumstances.  What makes less sense is that Leon would seriously instruct this 12 year old girl in how to make professional mob hits, but who knows, life is stranger than fiction.Mathilda, by the way, is played by Natalie Portman, in the movie that is probably the high point of her career to date.  In any case, her work in this movie is far more impressive than anything else she's done, including the second Star Wars trilogy and V is for Vendetta.  However, Portman was 12 or 14 when this movie was made, and the movie may get uncomfortably close to pedophillia for some.  There is absolutely nothing sexual about the relationship between Leon and Mathilda in the movie, except that Mathilda does develop a crush for Leon.Overall, the acting is exceptional.  The cinematography is excellent, and the direction, especially of the action scenes is outstanding.  There are a lot of familiar overtones in this film that would later appear in The Fifth Element.  Besson is at his best developing an ominous intense feel for an action sequence.  For instance, the scene where the police are setting up for their second attempt at storming Leon's apartment is very reminiscent of the heavy-handed way Besson's 22nd century NY Police acted in The Fifth Element.But the combination of the fatherhood/puppy love factor in a action thriller about a professional hitman may be a little disconcerting for some.  Others might call it new and fresh, I found it interesting but a little disturbing.

Her father hides drugs for the local kingpin Norman Stansfield, and one day, Stansfield takes revenge on her father, due to the fact that he stretched the drugs a little too far, and thus, kills her whole family while she is out grocery shopping. When she returns from shopping, she notices that her family has been murdered, and turns to her neighbor Leon, who is a professional hitman, for guidance. She eventually finds out exactly what he does for a living, and wants him to take her under his wing, and teach her how to become a ""cleaner"" like himself, so that she can avenge her brother's death.",5,Luc Besson's masterpiece!,1108944000,"02 21, 2005",2005,752,"['Matilda', 'troubled', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'who', 'abused', 'family', 'excluding', 'four', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'care', 'father', 'hides', 'drugs', 'local', 'kingpin', 'Norman', 'Stansfield', 'one', 'day', 'Stansfield', 'revenge', 'father', 'due', 'fact', 'stretched', 'drugs', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'thus', 'whole', 'family', 'out', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'When', 'shopping', 'family', 'been', 'murdered', 'neighbor', 'Leon', 'who', 'professional', 'hitman', 'guidance', 'eventually', 'out', 'exactly', 'what', 'living', 'take', 'wing', 'teach', 'how', 'become', 'cleaner', 'can', 'avenge', 'brother', 'death']",N/A
