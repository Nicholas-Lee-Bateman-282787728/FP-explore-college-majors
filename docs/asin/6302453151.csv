Overall I thought this was a good movie, how Esther character went from a spoiled brat to a woman. Also Joan Evans went from a spineless crybaby to a woman who stood up for herself. I loved the song &#34;it takes a lot of water to make a Wave&#34; it was so funny. However what I disliked about the movie was the fellows. The way all of them were acting right throught the end just made me think why do these women want them anyway. When they finally get the girls and are at the train station to see them off they were falling over the Wacs, like the girls couldn't see them through the window. I would recommend this to any one who wants to expand there collection of Esther Williams movies.",4,Finally availible on DVD,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,792,"['am', 'glad', 'more', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'movies', 'are', 'DVD', 'now', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'hers', 'Vivian', 'Blaine', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'how', 'Esther', 'character', 'went', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'woman', 'Also', 'Joan', 'Evans', 'went', 'spineless', 'crybaby', 'woman', 'who', 'stood', 'up', 'herself', 'loved', 'song', '34', 'lot', 'water', 'make', 'Wave', '34', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'However', 'what', 'disliked', 'movie', 'was', 'fellows', 'way', 'were', 'acting', 'right', 'throught', 'end', 'just', 'made', 'think', 'why', 'do', 'women', 'want', 'anyway', 'When', 'finally', 'get', 'girls', 'are', 'train', 'station', 'see', 'off', 'were', 'falling', 'Wacs', 'girls', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'window', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'who', 'expand', 'collection', 'Esther', 'Williams', 'movies']",Skirts Ahoy VHS

Arthur,"[1, 2]","Stuck with a turkey script--a sort of reverse ""On The Town"" with three waves trying unsuccessfully to land a sailor during a brief fun break--MGM brought in Debby Reynolds and Bobby Van to do a frantic dance number, Keenan Wynn to introduce himself (!), an old guy (inevitably called Pops) to add time to the film, the De Marco sisters to sing, and jazz crooner Billy Eckstine.  The minute and a half with Eckstine is wonderful, but the rest of the film is embarrassingly bad. The swimming numbers and lousy songs were low budget, the ""training camp"" Wave scenes were ridiculous, the acting...well, let's just say that Barry Sullivan was miscast and Vivian Blaine had already done all that in ""Guys and Dolls.""  Oh yes, and you have to see Keefe Brasselle trying to sing!  Taken as a satire on Esther Williams movies, this might be enjoyable to a few.  Otherwise, it might help to get drunk before hitting ""Play.""  Better yet, avoid this stinker.

313278,A1AELZTSDQ6R5Y,6302453151,"David Sale ""Make Mine Musicals!""","[1, 1]","Upfront admission - I adore her.  MGM were coerced by the Navy to do a  &#34;recruitment&#34; movie, extolling the virtues to young American women that a life in the navy would be fun.  And so it seems.  MGM threw in everything.  This has a fun script, great stars, and - considering the story has no show-biz connections - terrific production values and catchy songs.Esther once said in an interview that the character she played in this movie most  closely approximated her real self.  She certainly sails (or swims) through this movie with the utmost panache.  She has two highlight swimming sequences, both beautifully integrated into the plot.  Vivian Blaine and Barry Sullavan give solid support.  This stands as a masterpieceof needs (a recruitment movie) meeting MGM's entertainment standards.

313279,A23AFVXWF9A0CF,6302453151,Sallie A. Neal,"[30, 30]","Esther Williams AKA The Million Dollar Mermaid stars in this MGM musical where she among other young ladies join the Navy.  Although this film wasn't on a high budget, done by a popular director, or had alot of popular actors, Esther uses her charm to pull the movie together and bring the classic boy meets girl story to life!Esther plays Whitney Young who leaves her fiance at the alter and joins the Navy.  There she meets two other young ladies who are also having trouble with love.  One was left at the alter, and one just can't be in the right place at the right time.They decide they want to travel the world and forget about men altogether, that is until Whitney meets and falls in love with her Lt. Commander.  From then on, all she wants to do is win him over whatever the cost.  The other two girls play out their own stories of how they find happiness.No Esther Williams movie would be complete without a swimming scene, and this film is no exception.  Esther joins two young children in the pool and creates a very cute performance with some great little swimmers complete with a toy ladder and sailboat.Just when the girls think they are going to give up, each find their happiness in a corny, but almost tearful conclusion.  I really enjoy this film when I want to get away from it all.
