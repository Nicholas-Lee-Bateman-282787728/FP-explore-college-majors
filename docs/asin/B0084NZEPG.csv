1546324,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0084NZEPG,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[6, 6]","Not being satisfied with killing the western genre, Christian Slater turns his sights on spy thrillers. Slater plays a former FBI official who now works at the US embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria. There is a vigilante assassin of ""bad"" Muslims that for some reason is a problem. We get to see that the killer is a dark haired woman.In order to get Christian Slater back into the FBI business, the film incorporates the acting of Donald Sutherland, Hollywood's go-to guy for black ops since ""JFK."" In addition to the killings, the movie centers around Slater's obsession with a red headed belly dancer and a psychologist talking to a blond woman who teaches English.The film gives you clues and key plot points almost in a manner of ""Student Bodies"" with a big arrow and the word ""clue"" by it. The camera will zoom in and pause to let us know the director thinks his audience is composed of idiots. Slater was unconvincing. Elika Portnoy was boring. This is not an action thriller, but a poorly developed drama/mystery.On the plus side we did get to see some of the old architecture of Bulgaria.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, no nudity, minor bed scene.",2,NO WITNESSES,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,1143,"['Not', 'being', 'satisfied', 'killing', 'western', 'genre', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'sights', 'spy', 'thrillers', 'Slater', 'former', 'FBI', 'official', 'who', 'now', 'US', 'embassy', 'Sofia', 'Bulgaria', 'vigilante', 'assassin', 'bad', 'Muslims', 'reason', 'problem', 'get', 'see', 'killer', 'dark', 'haired', 'woman.In', 'order', 'get', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'back', 'FBI', 'business', 'film', 'acting', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'Hollywood', 'go-to', 'guy', 'black', 'ops', 'JFK', 'addition', 'killings', 'movie', 'centers', 'Slater', 'obsession', 'red', 'headed', 'belly', 'dancer', 'psychologist', 'talking', 'blond', 'woman', 'who', 'English.The', 'film', 'clues', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'almost', 'manner', 'Student', 'Bodies', 'big', 'arrow', 'word', 'clue', 'camera', 'will', 'zoom', 'pause', 'let', 'know', 'director', 'audience', 'composed', 'idiots', 'Slater', 'was', 'unconvincing', 'Elika', 'Portnoy', 'was', 'boring', 'not', 'action', 'thriller', 'poorly', 'developed', 'drama/mystery.On', 'plus', 'side', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'old', 'architecture', 'Bulgaria.Parental', 'Guide', 'f-bombs', 'nudity', 'minor', 'bed', 'scene']",N/A

When members of the Most Wanted terrorist list in Europe begin to get killed off the US Ambassador (Sutherland) sends for the best of the best. A former FBI field agent (Slater) begins to investigate. Judging by the plot and the cast this is one I was all ready to watch and enjoy. I had high expectations and was excited to see this. Then the movie started. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The acting was OK, but the movie was just so incredibly slow moving that I really found it had to pay attention to. This really felt like a made for TV movie with better actors. There have been a lot of anti-terrorist movies lately and none of them seem to really be that interesting. This one had the possibility of being one of the best. Then I watched it. While not as bad as the Steven Segal or Dolph Lundgren movies that have been coming out it's still not anything to rush out and see. Overall, long and boring and hard to stay focused on. I give it a C-.",2,A really long and boring movie with a great cast. I had high hopes and was disappointed. Nothing to rush to.
