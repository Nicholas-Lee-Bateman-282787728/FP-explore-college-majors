Based on the series of books by Astrid Lindgren, it features a vivacious Tami Erin as the title character and a well-cast ensemble.Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Longstocking--Pippi for short--lives with her sea-captain father and enjoys a colourful life, until an horrific storm separates the pair.  Pippi makes her way ashore and sets up housekeeping in a rambling old house called Villa Villekula; and later makes two new friends, Tommy and Annika Settigren (David Seaman and Cory Crow).  But Pippi also faces a tough enemy in the stern orphanage owner Miss Bannister (Eileen Brennan), and the rest of the town authorities.THE NEW ADVENTURES OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING was the long-awaited followup to the fondly remembered 1969-1970 Swedish film franchise (starring Inger Nilsson in the title role).  Fans of the original movies have always treated it with contempt, and while it does create some slight liberties with the original material, it does stay true to the whimsical and carefree themes which were hallmarks of the books.Tami Erin, if slightly too old for the role, gives a solid and heartfelt performance as Pippi.  David Seaman and Cory Crow are a bit too goody-goody, but that contrasts perfectly with Pippi's irreverent nature.  The always amazing Eileen Brennan steals many a scene with her hilarious role of the mean orphanage mistress.  Dennis Dugan and Dianne Hull play the Settigren parents, with Conrad John Schuck as Pippi's father.The theme song is very catchy.  You'll find yourself humming it for weeks--though I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing!

Other ones that fit rather well are show-stopper, shameless, unrepentent, metahuman, Goddess, and powerful almost to the point of being menacing but not quite.  You need only fear her if your life depends on NOT having fun.Oh, yeah.  And she's probably older and smarter than she pretends to be, and she's definitely MUCH wiser.All these things have made her one of my favorite fictional characters ever.So why is it that in this movie, she is none of those amazing things?As a child, I was a fairly poor individual, not at all like Pippi, but I did have a library card, and so I spent much time reading.  Naturally, when this movie came out, I couldn't go to see it, however, I did read the book, and I was immediately swept up into a childhood crush on its main character that lasted for years and years.At the age of 18 or so, I finally got the chance to see this movie, and I was apalled!  This film makes a mockery of everything Pippi is.For about 70% of the film, Pippi behaves completely out-of-character, and much of the rest of it is consumed by lousy characters who have no substance.  Pippi does get to rough up a few people, but unlike in the books, she only does it to three bad guys that act like the Curly, Larry and Moe.Additionally, this movie is plagued by the curse of having way too many unnecesary songs.  It could have been so much better.If you want to speak kindly of this movie, however, you won't be entirely without ammunition.  It does contain a few scenes of pleasing metahuman powers, and several of Pippi being a brat which ALMOST threaten to drag the movie out of the gutter it made for itself.If you still don't understand what I'm griping about, read all three Pippi books, then carefully review the scenes in the children's home.  You should be able to tell quite easily that none of them should have happened, especially the one where Pippi flinches at the striking of a ruler, as opposed to her book incarnation, whose skin was about the consistency of a brick wall.Long and short, as a movie, it's only marginally bad, but you definitely don't want to watch it because frankly, you're better off reading the books by about a billion times.",2,What words can describe Pippi Longstocking?,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,2222,"['Arrogant', 'good', 'one', 'rascal', 'Other', 'ones', 'fit', 'rather', 'well', 'are', 'show-stopper', 'shameless', 'unrepentent', 'metahuman', 'Goddess', 'powerful', 'almost', 'point', 'being', 'menacing', 'not', 'quite', 'need', 'only', 'fear', 'life', 'NOT', 'having', 'fun.Oh', 'yeah', 'probably', 'older', 'smarter', 'be', 'definitely', 'MUCH', 'things', 'have', 'made', 'one', 'favorite', 'fictional', 'characters', 'ever.So', 'why', 'movie', 'none', 'amazing', 'things', 'child', 'was', 'fairly', 'poor', 'individual', 'not', 'like', 'Pippi', 'did', 'have', 'library', 'card', 'so', 'spent', 'much', 'time', 'reading', 'Naturally', 'when', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'see', 'however', 'did', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'immediately', 'swept', 'up', 'childhood', 'crush', 'main', 'character', 'lasted', 'years', 'years.At', 'age', '18', 'so', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'apalled', 'film', 'mockery', 'everything', 'Pippi', '70', '%', 'film', 'Pippi', 'completely', 'out-of-character', 'much', 'rest', 'consumed', 'lousy', 'characters', 'who', 'have', 'substance', 'Pippi', 'get', 'rough', 'up', 'few', 'people', 'books', 'only', 'three', 'bad', 'guys', 'act', 'Curly', 'Larry', 'Moe.Additionally', 'movie', 'plagued', 'curse', 'having', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'unnecesary', 'songs', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'want', 'speak', 'kindly', 'movie', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'entirely', 'ammunition', 'contain', 'few', 'scenes', 'pleasing', 'metahuman', 'powers', 'several', 'Pippi', 'being', 'brat', 'ALMOST', 'threaten', 'drag', 'movie', 'gutter', 'made', 'itself.If', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', ""'m"", 'griping', 'read', 'three', 'Pippi', 'books', 'then', 'carefully', 'review', 'scenes', 'children', 'home', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'quite', 'easily', 'none', 'should', 'have', 'happened', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'Pippi', 'striking', 'ruler', 'opposed', 'book', 'incarnation', 'skin', 'was', 'consistency', 'brick', 'wall.Long', 'short', 'movie', 'only', 'marginally', 'bad', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'frankly', ""'re"", 'better', 'off', 'reading', 'books', 'billion', 'times']",N/A

However, I get the feeling that the film is painfully low-budget. While the main trio of kids capture their characters, the writing makes them very bland, uninteresting characters. Pippi still has the carefree attitude and friendliness that Lindgren's writing conveyed, but Tommy and Annika both seem to have lost any personality they had originally, and they originally only really existed to be shown as ordinary middle-class children. The storyline is very good, and the movie is appealing to younger viewers. However, the sub-plot of the men hoping to tear down Villa Villikulla feels like they're trying to pad the film out, and it would have been better to leave that out.Overall, the movie is worth a watch once, but you'd be better off reading the books about Pippi.",2,Decent Movie,1324339200,"12 20, 2011",2011,852,"['have', 'admit', 'movie', 'creative', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'However', 'get', 'feeling', 'film', 'painfully', 'low-budget', 'main', 'trio', 'kids', 'capture', 'characters', 'writing', 'very', 'bland', 'uninteresting', 'characters', 'Pippi', 'still', 'carefree', 'attitude', 'friendliness', 'Lindgren', 'writing', 'conveyed', 'Tommy', 'Annika', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'personality', 'had', 'originally', 'originally', 'only', 'really', 'existed', 'be', 'shown', 'ordinary', 'middle-class', 'children', 'storyline', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'appealing', 'younger', 'viewers', 'However', 'sub-plot', 'men', 'hoping', 'tear', 'down', 'Villa', 'Villikulla', 'feels', ""'re"", 'trying', 'pad', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'leave', 'out.Overall', 'movie', 'watch', 'once', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'off', 'reading', 'books', 'Pippi']",N/A

All of these combined to make for a dual rating from myself:  1 star for being one of the worst movies ever made, and yet 5 stars for being one of the worst movies ever made, but SO much fun to watch and make fun of.  Not being familiar with the original story or the characters involved, I come from just a film buff stand point and I have to say that this ranks #2 on my list of all time favorite worst movies. The lead actress in the role of Pippi comes off as a mental patient in a red wig set loose upon an unsuspecting town.  Her ""medicated"" style of acting is humorously manic in a cold-reading sort of way. Out of 8,000 hopefuls who auditioned for this role, this was the best they found? Yikes!
