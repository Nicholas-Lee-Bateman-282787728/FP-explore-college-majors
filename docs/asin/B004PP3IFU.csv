1423688,A1AM2YSWG5NRRJ,B004PP3IFU,"Sophia ""the thinker""","[6, 9]","This DVD featured the Native American kid Simon R. Baker, last scene in Once in a Blue Moon at age 10, where he showed exceptional promise. In Buckaroo he is 16 and all I can say is ""What happened?"" Not just to him but the entire cast! Every one of the actors sounded like they were reading their lines. I don't know if the story itself was any good because I ejected the disk and tossed it after suffering through truly awful acting for about a half hour. I just couldn't take it any more. Too bad. Could it have been produced so quickly and poorly that no time was allowed for rehearsal or even for the actors to read their scripts? That's the only explanation I can think of. This DVD would be excellent to use in acting classes as an example of how not to do it, but not for anything else.",1,Really disappointing performances,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,793,"['DVD', 'featured', 'Native', 'American', 'kid', 'Simon', 'R.', 'Baker', 'last', 'scene', 'Once', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'age', '10', 'where', 'showed', 'exceptional', 'promise', 'Buckaroo', '16', 'can', 'say', 'What', 'happened', 'Not', 'just', 'entire', 'cast', 'one', 'actors', 'sounded', 'were', 'reading', 'lines', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'ejected', 'disk', 'tossed', 'suffering', 'truly', 'awful', 'acting', 'half', 'hour', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'Too', 'bad', 'Could', 'have', 'been', 'produced', 'so', 'quickly', 'poorly', 'time', 'was', 'allowed', 'rehearsal', 'even', 'actors', 'read', 'scripts', 'only', 'explanation', 'can', 'think', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'use', 'acting', 'classes', 'example', 'how', 'not', 'do', 'not', 'anything', 'else']",N/A
