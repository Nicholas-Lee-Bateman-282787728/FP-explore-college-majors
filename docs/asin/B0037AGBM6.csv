This movie is also a very good example of  why ""city"" people should not live in the country.  As someone who spent most of her live on 100 acres I have to say that being on a farm without backup resources such as fuel, a generator bigger than something sitting in a wheelbarrow, extra food stores, and other heavy mobile equipment is very rare.  Big thumbs down in believability from me in that department for this movie.  The ending of the movie was awful.

While I'm not a fan of the controversial Uwe Boll, I have to admit that he did a solid job directing this film.Boll pairs up experienced TV actor Steve Bacic with Lauren Holly, who still looks hot despite knocking on 50's door.  Throw Luke Perry in the mix as their mysterious visitor Silas, and you've got a movie that stands apart from Boll's other work.So why is a movie with a decent cast, score and directing only getting three stars?  The writing is inconsistent.  There are two plot lines that pull you in and keep you interested: The apocalyptic changes taking place, and the identity of the strange visitor.  My complaint is that the apocalypse story line is all but abandoned as the film progresses.  You never get an explanation as to why some people vanish, yet others don't.  And while the movie's ending is concrete, it still doesn't answer any questions.I can sum this movie up in two words: Lost Potential.  It's really intriguing from the start, but the characters all seem oddly detached from the possibility that the world might end.  By the film's conclusion, you'll still be scratching your head over why certain things were happening in the movie.  Final Storm had the potential of a five-star movie, had the writing delivered on all of the mystery created at the start.

I will admit that some of films [mainly ones based on video games{but not all of those}] are not that great. But with that said he has made some really good ones. Films like &#8220;Postal&#8221; which is based on a game and &#8220;Rampage&#8221; among others come to mind. Luckily when this one was released it turned out to be a really good one.Tom and Gillian Grady is a couple who live outside a small town on a farm that Tom&#8217;s dad once owned with their son. They are a nice and keep to themselves type of people trying to make their new situation work. As luck would have it there is a storm that rolls in that lasts forever it seems. During this storm a man wanders onto their land and eventually to them, they help the man out. Once he is awake the man starts speaking of the end of the world and terrible things happening in the town. Things seem to be going like the man is saying as the Grady&#8217;s neighbors seem to be missing along with other things out of place. So is this man right about everything and could he be the help they need, or is there a much darker side to this guy, a murderous side?I have to say that I really enjoyed this little thriller here from Boll and writer Tim McGregor. This end of the world flick is a cool little low budget affair with strong performances from its cast. Steve Bacic, Lauren Holly and Cole Heppell are great as the Grady family and seem very natural together. Luke Perry is great as well as the stranger that wanders into these people&#8217;s lives. It is a very small cast but that is what makes it work.Now I have read reviews in which people say the vanishings and apocalypse thing are never explained but that is not true. If you pay attention it is clear as day and makes perfect sense, all I will say is know your Bible. If you know anything that Perry&#8217;s character is talking about here then you will get that ending. So with that said I really did enjoy this film even though I am sure some will disagree with me on it. You get a really informative commentary from Boll here in which I think he is a little too hard on his own film.

At this point the concept of the last days also dies down.From here on in it turns into a mild thriller, where the objective is no longer to find all the missing people or animals, but to find out who Silas (Luke Perry) really is.In the end it is a mild action picture that seems to have lost its way, maybe because of the storm.",3,The Lost Storm,1291248000,"12 2, 2010",2010,690,"['movie', 'started', 'out', 'lot', 'promise', 'got', 'lost', 'way', 'initially', 'started', 'end-times', 'tribulation', 'flick', 'when', 'stranger', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'came', 'Grady', 'home', 'was', 'complete', 're-direction', 'film.After', 'storm', 'down', 'animals', 'most', 'people', 'town', 'apart', 'few', 'vagabonds', 'are', 'also', 'gone', 'point', 'concept', 'last', 'days', 'also', 'down.From', 'here', 'mild', 'thriller', 'where', 'objective', 'no', 'longer', 'find', 'missing', 'people', 'animals', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'Silas', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'really', 'end', 'mild', 'action', 'picture', 'have', 'lost', 'way', 'maybe', 'storm']",N/A

Two crappy films that taste crappy together!Seriously, this is a movie with an identity crisis.  One hour, twenty-seven minutes of apocalypse followed by eight minutes of ""crazy guy uses crow bar to open can of whoop-ass"" wrapped up by fifteen seconds of ""well I'll be gosh-darned, Gladys- it IS the apocalypse!""  And then they all get sucked up into the rapture.  At least that's what I think it is.  God squishes out all the stars or something in about ten seconds of otherwise unexplained (and poorly executed) CGI.What does it all mean?  It hardly seems fair that they went to all the trouble of beating the crap out of the homicidal maniac and setting him on fire if the world picks that EXACT SAME MOMENT to get repossessed by the Almighty.  They could have saved themselves the trouble if they had just known.  Why have a fight to the death if death is a couple minutes away and inescapable?  I'd just have ask him to kindly put down the crowbar and have a nice cup of tea while we wait to be reduced to our component atoms.

1329529,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B0037AGBM6,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 1]","My Tivo is an interesting beast.  It loves to recommend movies for reasons that are known only to its algorithm. And to be fair, I do watch a lot of sci-fi apocalyptic movies, so when The Final Storm showed up in the queue I took the bait. Which is why I didn't know the movie was produced by...Uwe Boll.That's a test.  Anyone who hates him has probably moved on. For the rest of us willing to give the movie a chance, here's the review:The oddly mismatched Gradys consist of scruffy husband Tom (Steve Bacic), wide-eyed hottie Gillian (Lauren Holly) and their son Graham (Cole Heppell). Living alone on a farm, they hunker down during a terrible storm, only to discover they've lost all contact with the neighbors.  Never mind that the neighbors' trailer is clearly visible across the street and at no point does anyone decide to walk over and knock on a door - it's the apocalypse, so get with the program.As the family frets between staying and leaving, a stranger awakens in their midst with no memory of his past.  That stranger is none other than Luke Perry as Silas Hendershot, looking for work and enunciating all his lines like an Amish farmer. Something terrible has happened in the outside world, and Hendershot slowly undermines Tom's role as patriarch by being stalwart, dependable, and helpful around the house.  When things go south, it seems hardworking men will once again become a desirable commodity.But Tom isn't going to go down without a fight. Surly, often drunk, and prone to stupid explorations on his own, Tom discovers that the nearby town is filled with violent thugs. There's evidence everywhere that people just disappeared.  What happened?It becomes clear that Hendershot's intentions are less than pure towards Mrs. Grady, that Mrs. Grady's thoughts are less than pure, and that the reason the good, honest farm-folk have been left behind in the wake of an evident Rapture is because...wait for it...they are all less than pure.  In short, this is actually a biblical tale in which the moral fortitude of each character is tested.The problem with The Final Storm, besides the acting, potholed plot, and logic flaws, is that the audience expects an apocalyptic tale and ends up with a psychological thriller. When The Final Storm tries to be apocalyptic, it feels conveniently claustrophobic. There aren't many actors in the film, and the fact that the farm house just doesn't seem as isolated as it should makes it difficult to buy into the characters' decision to stay at the house.  When The Final Storm strives for a Cape Fear-style psychological thriller it's measurably better, bolstered by the aforementioned apocalyptic ruin just outside the farmhouse walls.The ending makes no sense whatsoever unless you buy into the biblical propaganda Hendershot spouts throughout the film.  Since he's a character we're inclined to distrust, The Final Storm doesn't earn its surprise twist.  But for those who are willing to stick with it, The Final Storm delivers a somewhat disjointed dialogue on the measure of the human soul.",2,"Oh, Rapture!",1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,3056,"['Tivo', 'interesting', 'beast', 'recommend', 'movies', 'reasons', 'are', 'known', 'only', 'algorithm', 'be', 'fair', 'do', 'watch', 'lot', 'sci-fi', 'apocalyptic', 'movies', 'so', 'when', 'Final', 'Storm', 'showed', 'up', 'queue', 'took', 'bait', 'Which', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Uwe', 'Boll.That', 'test', 'Anyone', 'who', 'probably', 'moved', 'rest', 'willing', 'give', 'movie', 'chance', 'here', 'review', 'oddly', 'mismatched', 'Gradys', 'consist', 'scruffy', 'husband', 'Tom', 'Steve', 'Bacic', 'wide-eyed', 'hottie', 'Gillian', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'son', 'Graham', 'Cole', 'Heppell', 'Living', 'alone', 'farm', 'hunker', 'down', 'terrible', 'storm', 'only', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'contact', 'neighbors', 'Never', 'mind', 'neighbors', 'trailer', 'clearly', 'visible', 'street', 'point', 'anyone', 'decide', 'walk', 'knock', 'door', 'apocalypse', 'so', 'get', 'program.As', 'family', 'frets', 'staying', 'leaving', 'stranger', 'midst', 'memory', 'past', 'stranger', 'none', 'other', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Silas', 'Hendershot', 'looking', 'work', 'enunciating', 'lines', 'Amish', 'farmer', 'Something', 'terrible', 'happened', 'outside', 'world', 'Hendershot', 'slowly', 'Tom', 'role', 'patriarch', 'being', 'stalwart', 'dependable', 'helpful', 'house', 'When', 'things', 'go', 'south', 'hardworking', 'men', 'will', 'once', 'again', 'become', 'desirable', 'commodity.But', 'Tom', ""n't"", 'going', 'go', 'down', 'fight', 'Surly', 'often', 'drunk', 'prone', 'stupid', 'explorations', 'own', 'Tom', 'nearby', 'town', 'filled', 'violent', 'thugs', 'evidence', 'everywhere', 'people', 'just', 'disappeared', 'What', 'happened', 'clear', 'Hendershot', 'intentions', 'are', 'less', 'pure', 'towards', 'Mrs.', 'Grady', 'Mrs.', 'Grady', 'thoughts', 'are', 'less', 'pure', 'reason', 'good', 'honest', 'farm-folk', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'wake', 'evident', 'Rapture', 'wait', 'are', 'less', 'pure', 'short', 'actually', 'biblical', 'tale', 'moral', 'fortitude', 'character', 'tested.The', 'problem', 'Final', 'Storm', 'acting', 'potholed', 'plot', 'logic', 'flaws', 'audience', 'apocalyptic', 'tale', 'up', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'When', 'Final', 'Storm', 'be', 'apocalyptic', 'conveniently', 'claustrophobic', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'actors', 'film', 'fact', 'farm', 'house', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'isolated', 'should', 'difficult', 'buy', 'characters', 'decision', 'stay', 'house', 'When', 'Final', 'Storm', 'Cape', 'Fear-style', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'measurably', 'better', 'bolstered', 'aforementioned', 'apocalyptic', 'ruin', 'just', 'farmhouse', 'walls.The', 'ending', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'buy', 'biblical', 'propaganda', 'Hendershot', 'film', 'character', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'distrust', 'Final', 'Storm', ""n't"", 'earn', 'surprise', 'twist', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'stick', 'Final', 'Storm', 'somewhat', 'disjointed', 'dialogue', 'measure', 'human', 'soul']",N/A
1329530,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0037AGBM6,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","This movie wasn't great and it wasn't horrible. Just something you watch if either you catch it and nothing else is on or if you like one of the main characters. There's not reason to watch beyond that.The plot had a lot of potential. Supposedly it's the end of the world and everyone is wiped out by a storm. Tom (Steve Bacic), his wife (Lauren Holly) and their teen son soon realize they might be the only ones left in their little country town. Then one stormy night a stranger, Silas (Luke Perry) pops up out of nowhere and to Tom's dismay, the couple offers Silas a place to stay. Soon strange things start happening, Silas begins to get uncomfortably attached to Tom's family and Tom asks him to leave.That's it in a nutshell. But, the point was supposed to be that the storm wiped out everyone yet you wouldn't know that by the characters' actions. We get no scenes outside of their little home or farm except one time when they go into town and finally see that everyone is gone except some looters. There is nothing shot to show evidence of people vanishing and the film didn't delve into the reason for the storm. Was it apocalyptic or not? I blame the writers because they did a horrible job with this. What we get is the storm being some kind of excuse to make this film seem different when all you get is some USA made-for-cable movie with D-movie stars. The plot is what makes you wanna watch but once you see it, you realize this is no more about the end of the world than watching Charlotte's Web.I must admit I had mixed feelings, that's why I gave it three stars. I kind of liked this movie because I did find the couple interesting. Tom and Gillian are having problems in their marriage and he's a drunk. Silas becomes attracted to Gillian (why I don't know) and wants to take her away from Tom which brings out some soap opera drama. So though the plot failed big time, the conflict between the characters kept me watching. Luke Perry and Steve Bacic are good but Lauren Holly was a mirror of her former lively self. She was draggy, boring and drab. I also found it hard to concentrate when she was in the room because I could not believe how she's altered her appearance. I barely recognized her with her collagen lips and boob job. It was embarrassing to see Holly, who used to be an attractive women in her own right, do such a drastic change. She looked horrible and her alteration makes her look much older than she is. She looked old enough to be Tom's mother. She had no emotion and mumbled through her dialogue probably because she can no longer move her lips.Luke Perry, well it's hard to see how he ever was a famous heartthrob but those days are gone and he's been in D-movie land since. But he is a good actor, much better than in his 90210 days. He did a good job as Silas though his character was one dimensional and badly written. I've never heard of Steve Bacic before but he kept me wanting to watch. He seemed to be the only actor who found his part interesting. He kept the fires burning when this movie could've really been boring and it was slow enough.Yes there is a mystery concerning Silas' character but I won't mention it in case you do watch the movie.This is not the type of movie you should spend money on though. Wait until it comes on television and check it out. All you're getting is some badly put together TV movie. Though it's not horrible, and I liked some aspects of it, it's nothing no one has to see by all means.",3,Plot Had Potential But...,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,3473,"['movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'was', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'Just', 'something', 'watch', 'catch', 'nothing', 'else', 'like', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'not', 'reason', 'watch', 'that.The', 'plot', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'Supposedly', 'end', 'world', 'everyone', 'wiped', 'out', 'storm', 'Tom', 'Steve', 'Bacic', 'wife', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'teen', 'son', 'soon', 'realize', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'ones', 'left', 'little', 'country', 'town', 'Then', 'one', 'stormy', 'night', 'stranger', 'Silas', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'nowhere', 'Tom', 'dismay', 'couple', 'Silas', 'place', 'stay', 'Soon', 'strange', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'Silas', 'get', 'uncomfortably', 'attached', 'Tom', 'family', 'Tom', 'leave.That', 'nutshell', 'point', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'storm', 'wiped', 'out', 'everyone', 'yet', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'characters', 'actions', 'get', 'scenes', 'little', 'home', 'farm', 'one', 'time', 'when', 'go', 'town', 'finally', 'see', 'everyone', 'gone', 'looters', 'nothing', 'shot', 'show', 'evidence', 'people', 'vanishing', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'delve', 'reason', 'storm', 'Was', 'apocalyptic', 'not', 'blame', 'writers', 'did', 'horrible', 'job', 'What', 'get', 'storm', 'being', 'kind', 'excuse', 'make', 'film', 'seem', 'different', 'when', 'get', 'USA', 'made-for-cable', 'movie', 'D-movie', 'stars', 'plot', 'what', 'wan', 'na', 'watch', 'once', 'see', 'realize', 'more', 'end', 'world', 'watching', 'Charlotte', 'Web.I', 'must', 'admit', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'kind', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', 'find', 'couple', 'interesting', 'Tom', 'Gillian', 'are', 'having', 'problems', 'marriage', 'drunk', 'Silas', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'Gillian', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'take', 'away', 'Tom', 'out', 'soap', 'opera', 'drama', 'plot', 'failed', 'big', 'time', 'conflict', 'characters', 'kept', 'watching', 'Luke', 'Perry', 'Steve', 'Bacic', 'are', 'good', 'Lauren', 'Holly', 'was', 'mirror', 'former', 'lively', 'self', 'was', 'draggy', 'boring', 'drab', 'also', 'found', 'hard', 'concentrate', 'when', 'was', 'room', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'how', 'altered', 'appearance', 'barely', 'recognized', 'collagen', 'lips', 'boob', 'job', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'see', 'Holly', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'attractive', 'women', 'own', 'right', 'do', 'drastic', 'change', 'looked', 'horrible', 'alteration', 'look', 'much', 'older', 'looked', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Tom', 'mother', 'had', 'emotion', 'mumbled', 'dialogue', 'probably', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'move', 'lips.Luke', 'Perry', 'well', 'hard', 'see', 'how', 'ever', 'was', 'famous', 'heartthrob', 'days', 'are', 'gone', 'been', 'D-movie', 'land', 'good', 'actor', 'much', 'better', '90210', 'days', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'Silas', 'character', 'was', 'one', 'dimensional', 'badly', 'written', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'Steve', 'Bacic', 'kept', 'wanting', 'watch', 'seemed', 'be', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'found', 'part', 'interesting', 'kept', 'fires', 'burning', 'when', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'really', 'been', 'boring', 'was', 'slow', 'enough.Yes', 'mystery', 'concerning', 'Silas', 'character', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mention', 'case', 'do', 'watch', 'movie.This', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'should', 'spend', 'money', 'Wait', 'television', 'check', 'out', ""'re"", 'getting', 'badly', 'put', 'together', 'TV', 'movie', 'not', 'horrible', 'liked', 'aspects', 'nothing', 'one', 'see', 'means']",N/A

Back ""Video Voyeur""","[4, 5]","Perhaps it was the negative or so-so reviews of ""The Final Storm"" which lowered my expectations of the movie but I was totally engrossed and awed by it!  I will not spoil it by giving away the plotline but it has traces of ""The Road"" and ""Cold Creek Manor"" running through it from start to finish.  The acting and storyline are first rate and the direction is near flawless.  It is very rare that a film which deals with an end of the world scenario relies on an eerily thrilling story instead of an overabundance of FX and bloodshed.

1329532,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B0037AGBM6,Stephen C. Coyle,"[1, 1]","This movie starts off in an attempt to scare and disturb you with weird weather patterns and chronic thunderstorms which have caused flooding in certain unspecified parts of America. It appears that the movie is going to be about the non-stop rain and the dangers of a deadly flood, but then the rain stops and that storyline is dropped and forgotten.Then the movie takes a different direction when the main characters all go into town and it's found that almost everyone has disappeared. It's an intriguing mystery and one that's worth investigating, but shortly after this plot twist is introduced the director seems to grow tired of it and it's never followed up on.Most of the movie is spent on a creepy stranger named Silas and his awkard relationship with the Grady family.There's awkward and disturbing competition between Silas and Tom Grady for the alfa-male status in the Grady household and annoying Bible preaching. This drags on slowly for what SEEMS like about three hours, but in reality is probably thirty or forty minutes.And while I don't want to give the ending away in a review I will say that the ending is bad. It's really, really bad. It's quite possibly the dumbest and most pointless conclusion to a movie I've ever seen.",1,Competing plot ideas that are poorly mixed together and a really disappointing ending!,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",2011,1246,"['movie', 'off', 'attempt', 'scare', 'disturb', 'weird', 'weather', 'patterns', 'chronic', 'thunderstorms', 'have', 'caused', 'flooding', 'certain', 'unspecified', 'parts', 'America', 'movie', 'going', 'be', 'non-stop', 'rain', 'dangers', 'deadly', 'flood', 'then', 'rain', 'stops', 'storyline', 'dropped', 'forgotten.Then', 'movie', 'different', 'direction', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'go', 'town', 'found', 'almost', 'everyone', 'disappeared', 'intriguing', 'mystery', 'one', 'worth', 'investigating', 'shortly', 'plot', 'twist', 'introduced', 'director', 'grow', 'tired', 'never', 'followed', 'up', 'on.Most', 'movie', 'spent', 'creepy', 'stranger', 'named', 'Silas', 'awkard', 'relationship', 'Grady', 'awkward', 'disturbing', 'competition', 'Silas', 'Tom', 'Grady', 'alfa-male', 'status', 'Grady', 'household', 'annoying', 'Bible', 'preaching', 'slowly', 'what', 'SEEMS', 'about', 'three', 'hours', 'reality', 'probably', 'thirty', 'forty', 'minutes.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'ending', 'away', 'review', 'will', 'say', 'ending', 'bad', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'quite', 'possibly', 'dumbest', 'most', 'pointless', 'conclusion', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",N/A
