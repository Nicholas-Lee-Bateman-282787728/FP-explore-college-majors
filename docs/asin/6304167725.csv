Instead its a series of adventures that make fun of hood movies from the 90s decade. Shawn and Marlon Wayans are a great comedy team and Marlon's voice in this movie sounds kind of cooky (like Larenz Tate in Menace II Society)Truth be told: This is a hilarious movie. Between the Korean store shootings, Keenon Ivory Wayans as the mailman yelling &quot;MESSAGE!&quot; in more than one occasion, and Crazy Legs' dream of being a dancer, you'll laugh your butt off. This movie doesn't have a plot...which is better in some cases and not in others. The only thing you won't like about the movie is that it had a very low budget (it cost more to do the VHS box art), and that the movie is very dark and Loc Dog's voice..... at least that scared me.Overall, Don't Be a Menace is a hilarious movie. Believe it or not, it's better than &quot;Scary Movie&quot;.

If you don't like gang movies though I wouldn't suggest watching this, but I could be wrong. A brother named Ashtray learns is learning how to live in the hood from homeboys, he meets a black beauty, Dashikee, I don't know how to spell that but close enough. He wants to move out of the ghetto with her and start a new life, a new child but alot of things get in his way, mostly Toothpicks gang. There are so many funny parts in this film, I'd say the funniest are when Toothpick was at the party and was talking about being in the shower with men, the MC Hammer dream, the convient store incident and in the movies begining when the two guys get shot. I demand that you watch this film, but as I said only if your into this type of thing. Great movie!

405064,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,6304167725,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[2, 3]","Before 'Scary Movie' the Wayans Brothers made this movie, 'Don't Be a Menace'. It is a spoof on movies like 'Boyz N the Hood' and 'Menace II Society', two great movies about the hoods in Los Angeles. I saw this movie when it first was released in theaters and now have watched this about 10 or 15 times. There's tons of crude humor, tons of profanity, tons of explicit sexual references and even some mock drug use. Everything you would expect to come out the pen of a Wayans brother. Don't get me wrong, they are talented guys and I enjoy watching their (Shawn and Marlon) show from time to time, but they're not exactly the African-American Woody Allens. However, I do have to give it up for their (sometimes witty) jabs at those ""Growin' Up in Da Hood"" dramas.There are some genuinely funny moments that I will always like: Bernie Mac's cameo as the black cop who hates anything and anybody black, Suli McCullough as the wheelchair bound Crazy Legs doing his MC Hammer ""U Can't Touch This"" number, the ""Hurry Up and Buy!"" scene at the convenience store, Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) applying for a job at the DMV. There are more very funny gags worth a barrel of laughs, but there are also moments where they simply push the crudeness envelope and deliver a lot more groans than laughs. There's one scene where Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones) are having foreplay which wasn't all that appealing.Marlon's character is obnoxious at times. He's another comic actor who sometimes tries too hard to be funny and simply hams it up. Helen Martin (""227"") steals the show as the pot-smoking grandmother. You can, maybe, consider this a hit-or-miss comedy. But there are a good enough amount of hits to overshadow the misses. It's still worth watching and has its memorable moments.",4,"The movie title alone, takes two hours to say",1183507200,"07 4, 2007",2007,1797,"[""'Scary"", 'Movie', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'made', 'movie', ""'Do"", ""n't"", 'Be', 'Menace', 'spoof', 'movies', ""'Boyz"", 'N', 'Hood', 'II', 'Society', 'two', 'great', 'movies', 'hoods', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'saw', 'movie', 'when', 'first', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'now', 'have', 'watched', '10', '15', 'times', 'tons', 'crude', 'humor', 'tons', 'profanity', 'tons', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'references', 'even', 'mock', 'drug', 'use', 'Everything', 'would', 'expect', 'come', 'out', 'pen', 'Wayans', 'brother', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'talented', 'guys', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Shawn', 'Marlon', 'show', 'time', 'time', ""'re"", 'not', 'exactly', 'African-American', 'Woody', 'Allens', 'However', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'up', 'sometimes', 'witty', 'jabs', 'Growin', 'Up', 'Da', 'Hood', 'are', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'moments', 'will', 'always', 'like', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'cameo', 'black', 'cop', 'who', 'anything', 'anybody', 'black', 'Suli', 'McCullough', 'wheelchair', 'Crazy', 'Legs', 'doing', 'MC', 'Hammer', 'U', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Touch', 'number', 'Hurry', 'Up', 'Buy', 'scene', 'convenience', 'store', 'Loc', 'Dog', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'applying', 'job', 'DMV', 'are', 'more', 'very', 'funny', 'gags', 'barrel', 'laughs', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'where', 'simply', 'push', 'crudeness', 'envelope', 'deliver', 'lot', 'more', 'groans', 'laughs', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Ashtray', 'Shawn', 'Wayans', 'Dashiki', 'Tracey', 'Cherelle', 'Jones', 'are', 'having', 'foreplay', 'was', ""n't"", 'appealing.Marlon', 'character', 'obnoxious', 'times', 'comic', 'actor', 'who', 'tries', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'funny', 'simply', 'hams', 'up', 'Helen', 'Martin', '227', 'show', 'pot-smoking', 'grandmother', 'can', 'maybe', 'consider', 'hit-or-miss', 'comedy', 'are', 'good', 'enough', 'amount', 'hits', 'overshadow', 'misses', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'memorable', 'moments']",Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood VHS

There are also references to Poetic Justice, Juice, and  Higher Learning.  Without having seen the first two, most people will  probably not get the jokes.

Batica,"[6, 7]","Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood os one of the funniest as far as the Wayans spoof comedies go and I'll put it to the table that it's one of the best comedies I've ever seen. You can see that the Wayans really wanted to shed some light on the violent &quot;hood&quot; movies of the early to mid 90's and they did it very well.Honestly, every hood movie was made fun of in this movie. Boyz in the Hood, Menace II Society, Juice, Friday, Poetic Justice, Higher Learning you name it, they made fun of it. And let's not leave out that they also made fun of how society depicts the inner city. But even so, it was still done in good taste and truly at no one's expense (so really, lighten up. It's just a movie).Marlon Wayans really came into his own in this one. He really showed his true comedic and acting abilities in this and made sure that every moment in this movie had a laugh in every scene. This was the starting point and the staple of how bad they were going to make fun of other movies (IE Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2).This is a must for people who love spoof comedy and comedy in general because no matter what, you will laugh through the entire movie. If you're looking for other spoof movies or anything of that nature, also check out CB-4 and the spoof of it FEAR OF A BLACK HAT. And of course, SCARY MOVIE and SCARY MOVIE 2.

The comedy is raw and well acted by the cast. The story revolves around the character Ash Tray (Shawn Wayans), taken out of Cuba Gooding's Trey persona in Boyz 'N The Hood. Ash Tray returns to his old neighborhood of South Central to live with his father for good after being dropped off by his mother (Vivica A. Fox), who plays a small part. From there, Tray lives with his father, who ironically looks more like a small brother. He gives Tray bad advice of how to get on in the ghetto but Tray sees other ways and claims to leave the ill-sighted hood for good. He then ventures over to his cousin De Loc (Marlon Wayans) and both decide to go on an adventure in the hood. Along the way, they end up in wacky yet comic situations such as the Korean Store, the Bank and the public cookouts.There are many characters taken out of the famed movies of the late 90s including Trech's character in Jason's Lyric played in this movie as the centre villian. The plots are somewhat weak but it will keep you laughing.

My favorite part is the gang initiation scene with the double dutch reveal - still cracks me up everytime...Now, I've purchased it on VHS, then upgraded to the bare bones DVD and the Unrated Collector's Edition DVD. When I saw it was on Blu Ray, I wanted it.. The picture is slightly better than the Unrated DVD and it has all the same bonus features + a music video..BUT, even though the Blu Ray is dubbing itself as the director's cut, it's the theatrical version which clocks in at 89 minutes..hence the original R-Rating . The Blu Ray cover lists it with a running time of 95 min, which is the unrated version's running time... More confusing, the Miramax Unrated DVD (released around 2007)indicates it's running time is 89 minutes, when it's really 94 minutes. Needless to say, if you have the Unrated Miramax DVD, don't bother upgrading to the Echobridge version, it's just the theatrical version with the unrated version's special features..Great movie either way. Btw, I do applaud EB for making an effort to include special features, considering they're a budget label not known for bells and whistles.. Who knows, maybe the people that now own Miramax (it's not Disney) now demanded the inclusion.. However, these companies need to be a bit more diligent when they release products.. it's their job to give accurate descriptions about their products and features, so as to avoid class action law suits and recalls..

Like the Scary Movie flicks it helps if you know the source films (Boyz N The Hood etc) fairly well.  A lot of the funniest moments come from the deadpan way ludicrous lines are said, eg, of a pretty girl: 'What's her name?' 'Oh, that's Dashiki.'  And the way characters refer to 'the hood' in inverted commas all the time, as in, 'I'm leaving 'the hood',' (cue gunshot).

405097,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6304167725,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 17]","The title itself of the Wayans Brother's 1996 parody, Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, comically implies to several different films concerning African-American males coming of age in socially troubling environments.  Some of the titles that come to mind are Boyz n the Hood (1991), Juice (1992), and Menace II Society (1993) among many others.  Even though many of these films possess a high cinematic value, the Wayans recognize an excess of these types of films, as they provide a parody portrayal of the difficulties young African-American males face while growing up in rough neighborhoods throughout the United States.  Guiltlessly the Wayans approach this theme with ruthless abandon while applying their traditional spoofing spin on it, which unquestionably will cause both irritation and amusement.The story follows a similar path of Boyz n the Hood from which the audience will recognize the name Tr&eacute;.  Here the name has mutated into Ashtray, and is performed by Shawn Wayans.  The film opens with a picturesque aerial shot of the neighborhood where a stop sign is one of the first things that attracts the audience's attention, which states, ""I wouldn't stop if I was you.""  It is a brief display of impending parody and the comic tone that will heavily play with stereotypes and prejudices, but it also hints of the merciless assault of satire that the Wayans will deliver in this film.Ashtray's mother drops him off at his father's place while she states, ""You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies.""  Ashtray is supposed to learn how to become a man from his father.  Hilariously the audience will discover that Ashtray's father is younger than him, and this immature character could not possibly teach Ashtray any character qualities such as responsibility and loyalty.  Instead, the father informs him not to smoke or drink his stuff while also letting him spend bedtime with the women he brings home.  Despite the crazy humor, the Wayans produce serious undercurrents that deal with racial issues, stereotypes across ethnic groups, and gender issues.The social importance of friendships is seen through Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) whose identity is more or less ripped off from O-Dog in Menace II Society.  The parody does not take any hostages in this film, as it fools around with the idea of being in bad company.  Together Loc Dog and Ashtray continue to display the daily struggles of living in the `hood.  There are moments when the film presents high quality parody to scenes where the comedy sinks to the level of a third grader's poop humor.  Nevertheless, Don't Be a Menace touches a part of the American tapestry with brutal honesty, as this spoof could also serve as a social criticism.  The scene where they play Po'Nopoly, a Monopoly spoof, highlights some of the dismal situations where society limits the African-Americans.Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood might suggest to some that there have been too many films about struggling young African-American males.  Maybe the parody is on society, as several films have to be made, yet no significant changes have been made to help promote a better situation for African-Americans.  The Wayans recognize the problem and through this parody deliver a message that something has to be done so people do not need to say, ""Man, I need to get out of this place.""",3,Wayans' Parody Takes Big Risk with Controversial Issue...,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",2005,3457,"['title', 'Wayans', 'Brother', '1996', 'parody', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Menace', 'South', 'Central', 'Drinking', 'Juice', 'Hood', 'comically', 'several', 'different', 'films', 'concerning', 'African-American', 'males', 'coming', 'age', 'socially', 'troubling', 'environments', 'titles', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'Boyz', 'Hood', '1991', 'Juice', '1992', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', '1993', 'many', 'others', 'Even', 'many', 'films', 'possess', 'high', 'cinematic', 'value', 'Wayans', 'recognize', 'excess', 'types', 'films', 'provide', 'parody', 'portrayal', 'difficulties', 'young', 'African-American', 'males', 'face', 'growing', 'up', 'rough', 'neighborhoods', 'United', 'States', 'Guiltlessly', 'Wayans', 'approach', 'theme', 'ruthless', 'abandon', 'applying', 'traditional', 'spoofing', 'spin', 'unquestionably', 'will', 'cause', 'irritation', 'amusement.The', 'story', 'similar', 'path', 'Boyz', 'Hood', 'audience', 'will', 'recognize', 'name', 'Tr', 'eacute', 'Here', 'name', 'mutated', 'Ashtray', 'performed', 'Shawn', 'Wayans', 'film', 'picturesque', 'aerial', 'shot', 'neighborhood', 'where', 'stop', 'sign', 'one', 'first', 'things', 'audience', 'attention', 'would', ""n't"", 'stop', 'was', 'brief', 'display', 'impending', 'parody', 'comic', 'tone', 'will', 'heavily', 'play', 'stereotypes', 'prejudices', 'also', 'merciless', 'assault', 'satire', 'Wayans', 'will', 'deliver', 'film.Ashtray', 'mother', 'off', 'father', 'place', 'know', 'there', 'ai', ""n't"", 'no', 'positive', 'black', 'females', 'movies', 'Ashtray', 'supposed', 'learn', 'how', 'become', 'man', 'father', 'Hilariously', 'audience', 'will', 'discover', 'Ashtray', 'father', 'younger', 'immature', 'character', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'teach', 'Ashtray', 'character', 'qualities', 'such', 'responsibility', 'loyalty', 'Instead', 'father', 'not', 'smoke', 'drink', 'stuff', 'also', 'letting', 'spend', 'bedtime', 'women', 'home', 'crazy', 'humor', 'Wayans', 'produce', 'serious', 'undercurrents', 'deal', 'racial', 'issues', 'stereotypes', 'ethnic', 'groups', 'gender', 'issues.The', 'social', 'importance', 'friendships', 'seen', 'Ashtray', 'cousin', 'Loc', 'Dog', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'identity', 'more', 'less', 'ripped', 'off', 'O-Dog', 'Menace', 'II', 'Society', 'parody', 'not', 'take', 'hostages', 'film', 'idea', 'being', 'bad', 'company', 'Together', 'Loc', 'Dog', 'Ashtray', 'continue', 'display', 'daily', 'struggles', 'living', 'hood', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'film', 'presents', 'high', 'quality', 'parody', 'scenes', 'where', 'comedy', 'sinks', 'level', 'third', 'grader', 'poop', 'humor', 'Nevertheless', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Menace', 'part', 'American', 'tapestry', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'spoof', 'could', 'also', 'serve', 'social', 'criticism', 'scene', 'where', 'play', ""Po'Nopoly"", 'Monopoly', 'spoof', 'dismal', 'situations', 'where', 'society', 'African-Americans.Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Menace', 'South', 'Central', 'Drinking', 'Juice', 'Hood', 'might', 'suggest', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'struggling', 'young', 'African-American', 'males', 'Maybe', 'parody', 'society', 'several', 'films', 'have', 'be', 'made', 'yet', 'significant', 'changes', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'help', 'promote', 'better', 'situation', 'African-Americans', 'Wayans', 'recognize', 'problem', 'parody', 'deliver', 'message', 'something', 'be', 'done', 'so', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'say', 'Man', 'need', 'get', 'place']",Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood VHS

It does have its funny moments that will really have you laughing, but then there are times when it seems like the Wayans brothers are trying a little too hard to get laughs (e.g. the grandmother who swears, smokes weed, and gets in fights for the fun of it gets old after a while).

Usually movies like these are only funny at the time of their release but this one might just be timeless. If you have yet to see any of the films that are being parodied, I suggest you do so before watching to truly appreciate where the Wayans are coming from. From Ashtray's father saying, ""after that, in the nighttime, I want you to cut the hair on my balls."", to the right-hook Ashtray puts on Loc Dog's grandma, this comedy truly pulls off all of their jokes. Anyone, black, white, purple, can enjoy this movie as long as you're not looking for perfection and don't mind dumbing-down (stoned) a little bit. A couple more things to look for...the 20-bag hanging from Loc Dog's hair, the two grandmas having a dance-off, Ashtray's poetic line, ""who needs foreplay when you're jacking-off?"" and a bystander's line at the very end of the movie when he walks up to grandma and says, ""Hey grandma, you've got the juice now."" So good. I don't think this movie is as good as FRIDAY but I do think it deserves recognition considering what the Wayans have done for comedy all throughout the 90's and into the noughties.

It also takes typical black stereotypes and elevates them to a whole new level, making the stereotypes totally absurd and over-the-top.The Wayans brothers are great comic leads in this film. Shawn plays the do-gooder who escaped the ways of the hood, while Marlon plays the quick-triggered thug who can't decide if he wants to wear sneakers or bunny slippers.

405128,ABE14SVILZLNY,6304167725,"SID ""Punk""","[9, 10]","`Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood' is an hilarious take on all the hood type movies and surprising it does come off really funny. Just as funny as `Friday' and such movies. Brothers, Marlon and Shawn Wayans, don't have any problem making fun of the typical ghetto life that a lot of Afro-Americans might have to experience. The thought of this might not be too appealing at first but give it a try and you should end up laughing without a doubt. Some viewers have said that you need to be a black person to find this movie funny, or you need to have lived in the hood, which, in my opinion, is not true, I'm white, I live in England and my face was so sore after laughing at this. The only thing that helps is if you've seen the movies that this is parodying, and then you should certainly have no problem finding this film hilarious. Just like I did.To say, `Don't Be A Menace...' is a comedy classic is quiet the understatement. All the characters in this movie provide laugh after laugh. It's the practice run for Wayans movies to be made years later on. `Scary Movie 1 & 2' clearly have borrowed the mold from `Don't Be A Menace...' More films should be as funny as this one. Marlon's character `Loc Dog' certainly squares up to `Smokey' from the `Friday' anyday. Marlon's dialogue/appearance is cleverly written to poke fun at the stereotypical male you've seen in any John Singleton film. The cast is strong, good comedic performances come from the Wayans brothers (although, Marlon is the much better of the two), Suli McCullough, and Lahmard J. Tate, playing Ashtray's father, the second funniest character in this movie. The script is almost faultless in its field, and the jokes come quick and they don't let up until the end. This all helps to make this an addictive comedy classic.
