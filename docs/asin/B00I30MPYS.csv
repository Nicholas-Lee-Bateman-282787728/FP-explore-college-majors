1693280,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B00I30MPYS,G. Teslovich,"[0, 0]","Again, like other cheap movies (those who care little about their audience) this failed to have subtitles so that dialogue could be followed. Especially crucial in movies in which dialogue plays an important role. Made worse, at times, because the enunciations and audio levels were of poor quality.Had potential but poorly executed (pun - movie spent a lot of time executing). The thought questions with consequences are well known (I've been using the same ones for many years). How they were presented with only a few solutions and consequences were overly simplistic and not well developed. Also, the overriding theme of choosing a limited number to survive and how those chosen should survive challenges were poorly and incompletely presented. Overall, disappointed because some of the premises in the story had potential to exercise thought.",1,Kiosk &lt;1,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,847,"['Again', 'other', 'cheap', 'movies', 'who', 'care', 'little', 'audience', 'failed', 'have', 'subtitles', 'so', 'dialogue', 'could', 'be', 'followed', 'Especially', 'crucial', 'movies', 'dialogue', 'important', 'role', 'Made', 'worse', 'times', 'enunciations', 'audio', 'levels', 'were', 'poor', 'quality.Had', 'potential', 'poorly', 'executed', 'pun', 'movie', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'executing', 'thought', 'questions', 'consequences', 'are', 'well', 'known', ""'ve"", 'been', 'using', 'same', 'ones', 'many', 'years', 'How', 'were', 'presented', 'only', 'few', 'solutions', 'consequences', 'were', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'Also', 'overriding', 'theme', 'choosing', 'limited', 'number', 'survive', 'how', 'chosen', 'should', 'survive', 'challenges', 'were', 'poorly', 'incompletely', 'presented', 'Overall', 'disappointed', 'premises', 'story', 'had', 'potential', 'exercise', 'thought']",N/A

1693283,A34FM3WH2825NZ,B00I30MPYS,Max,"[0, 0]","After the Dark is so ridiculously stupid that you'll be wondering if this is actually supposed to be a comedy.The plot assumes the event of a global nuclear war in which 20 highschool students are trying to decide who gets the right to live in a quarantined environment with only enough living space and resources designated for 10 persons for a span of one year.The decision of who gets to stay and who gets culled from the herd is decided by classist and sexist decree. Once the tally is in, the others either get shot like cattle (to spare them from suffering in the wilderness) or they try to outrun their fate. Selection for living in the bunker is most preferential to females because they can breed and thus eventually re-populate the earth .. that is, after they leave the bunker when the food and air goes out.No one ever factors in that even a year after worldwide nuclear detonation, life on earth would unbearable and so incredibly contaminated with radioactive waste that it would not be possible to survive.After the Dark is nothing more than a sarcastic take on an otherwise frightening reality. If you're interested in seeing realistic view of nuclear warfare than I suggest you track down the film, 'Threads'.",1,Over-dramatized hype for stupid people,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,1226,"['Dark', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'stupid', ""'ll"", 'be', 'wondering', 'actually', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy.The', 'plot', 'event', 'global', 'nuclear', 'war', '20', 'highschool', 'students', 'are', 'trying', 'decide', 'who', 'right', 'live', 'quarantined', 'environment', 'only', 'enough', 'living', 'space', 'resources', 'designated', '10', 'persons', 'span', 'one', 'year.The', 'decision', 'who', 'stay', 'who', 'culled', 'herd', 'decided', 'classist', 'sexist', 'decree', 'tally', 'others', 'get', 'shot', 'cattle', 'spare', 'suffering', 'wilderness', 'try', 'outrun', 'fate', 'Selection', 'living', 'bunker', 'most', 'preferential', 'females', 'can', 'breed', 'thus', 'eventually', 're-populate', 'earth', '..', 'leave', 'bunker', 'when', 'food', 'air', 'one', 'ever', 'factors', 'even', 'year', 'worldwide', 'nuclear', 'detonation', 'life', 'earth', 'would', 'unbearable', 'so', 'incredibly', 'contaminated', 'radioactive', 'waste', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'possible', 'survive.After', 'Dark', 'nothing', 'more', 'sarcastic', 'take', 'otherwise', 'frightening', 'reality', ""'re"", 'interested', 'seeing', 'realistic', 'view', 'nuclear', 'warfare', 'suggest', 'track', 'down', 'film']",N/A
