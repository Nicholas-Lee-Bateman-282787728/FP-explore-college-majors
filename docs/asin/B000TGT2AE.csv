1090012,A20YZGG6QXZ6IJ,B000TGT2AE,"Brian ""Technophile and Bibliophile""","[0, 0]","Having loved this series when it first aired I have been so disappointed that Season 1: (The only season), hasn't been released yet.Now, the entire series as of this review is available via Hulu and I say down and watched the entire thing with relish.  Few things stood out after watching.  First, there is a moment in the pilot where Doe introduces his new cop friend (John Marshall Jones) to his new bartender/boss (William Forsythe).  Second or third episode the exact same scene plays itself out like they had never met.  There are other small things that seem to be glossed over and altered strangely but overall these things are minor.  Second, I never realized how savagely annoying his ""assistant"" (Sprague Grayden) was till about the fourth episode and it really took away some of the enjoyment.Took 5 or 6 episodes for the plot to really develop but once it got rolling it was an enjoyment through to the end. The acting was so-so in some places and some of the episodes were more of a detraction to the main storyline and I can see why some people are mixed over this series and I can more understand why it hasn't been released yet.Go watch on Hulu while it is available and free and judge for yourself. Overall it was a very solid 4 stars for me and even worth owning in the future...",4,Longing to own...

You have to ask yourself this one simple question, how can all of the garbage being produced these days compare to ""John Doe"". The series is superbly written, the actors are great, the program has everything that one would want in a series. Then the FOX network canx the show after just ""1"" season, come on. However, I was able to stumble onto a copy of the series on ebay, the quality is not bad, however, I would love to have an original copy. It would be even better to have a solid ending like what happened with ""Jericho"". But we all know that will never happen, the execs will never complete the saga, but they will produce reality trash like ""American Idol, Survior"", etc...They just do not care about the regular person who wants to watch a solid program.",5,John Doe the Series,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,847,"['series', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'networks', 'have', 'ask', 'one', 'simple', 'question', 'how', 'can', 'garbage', 'being', 'produced', 'days', 'compare', 'John', 'Doe', 'series', 'superbly', 'written', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'program', 'everything', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'series', 'Then', 'FOX', 'network', 'canx', 'show', 'just', '1', 'season', 'come', 'However', 'was', 'able', 'stumble', 'copy', 'series', 'ebay', 'quality', 'not', 'bad', 'however', 'would', 'love', 'have', 'original', 'copy', 'would', 'be', 'even', 'better', 'have', 'solid', 'ending', 'what', 'happened', 'Jericho', 'know', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'execs', 'will', 'never', 'complete', 'saga', 'will', 'produce', 'reality', 'trash', 'American', 'Idol', 'Survior', 'etc', 'just', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'regular', 'person', 'who', 'watch', 'solid', 'program']",N/A

1090015,A21HAN5XF6M22X,B000TGT2AE,Michael L. Emery,"[4, 4]","Having watched this show and the other Fox show ""Fastlane"" I am completely baffled why Fastlane is now out on DVD but not John Doe.Both of these series came out for the 2002-2003 season on FOX.Both were cancelled after just one season.Fastlane gets released on DVD, John Doe has yet to. Why????I actually liked Fastlane, so my disappointment is not biased against that show. My disappointment is based on the fact that, unlike Fastlane, John Doe had a mystery to solve and a DVD extra giving us the answers seems fair to ask for. (Yes, I know the creators told us in an Entertainment Weekly segment what was really going on, however something tells me they were not being completely serious)Plus, when John Doe was ""on the bubble"" near the end of the season, I recall three times more ""save this show"" efforts for John Doe than for Fastlane. Meaning, this show seems to have more fans than Fastlane.Not to mention, it was a great show! A unique premise, excellent writing, good cast, a couple of shocking deaths, and full of interesting trivia that educated.On a ""wishful thinking"" note; None of the main actors seem to be all that busy currently, so a mini-episode that wraps everything up would definitely cause renewed interest, which would likely result in sales that justify the costs of filming it. yes, I know that will probably never happen, however I DID say it was just ""wishful thinking.""Bottom line: Every person that I've shown the first episode to, wants to see more. And of the dozen or so that I've let watch all the episodes, only 2 have not cared to own it on DVD. So if that's just MY experience, it seems there would be masses of people who have never heard of John Doe, who would also love it.Fox seems to have a knack for cancelling great shows (FIREFLY!) and John Doe was one of them. So if we can't have more John Doe, at least let us have the John Doe was were able to enjoy for the brief time it was on the air.That's my rant, thank you for coming. *smirk*",5,"FASTLANE is on DVD, but not John Doe????",1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,1982,"['Having', 'watched', 'show', 'other', 'Fox', 'show', 'Fastlane', 'am', 'completely', 'baffled', 'why', 'Fastlane', 'now', 'out', 'DVD', 'not', 'John', 'Doe.Both', 'series', 'came', 'out', '2002-2003', 'season', 'FOX.Both', 'were', 'cancelled', 'just', 'one', 'season.Fastlane', 'released', 'DVD', 'John', 'Doe', 'yet', 'Why', 'actually', 'liked', 'Fastlane', 'disappointment', 'not', 'biased', 'show', 'disappointment', 'based', 'fact', 'Fastlane', 'John', 'Doe', 'had', 'mystery', 'solve', 'DVD', 'extra', 'giving', 'answers', 'fair', 'ask', 'Yes', 'know', 'creators', 'told', 'Entertainment', 'Weekly', 'segment', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'going', 'however', 'something', 'tells', 'were', 'not', 'being', 'completely', 'serious', 'when', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'bubble', 'end', 'season', 'recall', 'three', 'times', 'more', 'save', 'show', 'efforts', 'John', 'Doe', 'Fastlane', 'Meaning', 'show', 'have', 'more', 'fans', 'Fastlane.Not', 'mention', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'unique', 'premise', 'excellent', 'writing', 'good', 'cast', 'couple', 'shocking', 'deaths', 'full', 'interesting', 'trivia', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'note', 'None', 'main', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'busy', 'currently', 'mini-episode', 'everything', 'up', 'would', 'definitely', 'cause', 'renewed', 'interest', 'would', 'likely', 'result', 'sales', 'justify', 'costs', 'filming', 'yes', 'know', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'happen', 'however', 'DID', 'say', 'was', 'just', 'wishful', 'thinking', 'Bottom', 'line', 'person', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'first', 'episode', 'see', 'more', 'dozen', 'so', ""'ve"", 'let', 'watch', 'episodes', 'only', '2', 'have', 'not', 'cared', 'own', 'DVD', 'So', 'just', 'MY', 'experience', 'would', 'be', 'masses', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'John', 'Doe', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'love', 'it.Fox', 'have', 'knack', 'cancelling', 'great', 'shows', 'FIREFLY', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'one', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', 'John', 'Doe', 'least', 'let', 'have', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'were', 'able', 'enjoy', 'brief', 'time', 'was', 'air.That', 'rant', 'thank', 'coming', '*smirk*']",N/A

In my opinion it could have become increasingly popular in its second and subsequent seasons if Fox had only given it the opportunity.

1090018,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B000TGT2AE,N. Gregg,"[0, 9]","This review is written after watching the first 9 episodes - perhaps it improved, but I seriously doubt it.The lead actor is handsome, but has ZERO personality (no winning smile, twinkle of the eyes, no sense of humor...)  The supporting cast is not much better.  While John Doe's endless knowledge of all things knowable might come in handy on occasion to the police, for the most part it's completely implausible they would consult him. On top of that he contaminates crime scenes, evidence and dead bodies before the ME gets to them and for the most part has no business being at the scenes much less given the unrestricted access.  And just because you have knowledge, that doesn't make you a detective or Sherlock Holmes (or Monk) observant.  The police chief(?) is completely unbelievable in her role as well - especially when she is in the interrogation room with a suspect.To be honest, the only reason I watched this many episodes was pure curiosity as to his identity - but my curiosity isn't strong enough to continue to sit through more of this crap.  This show is based on a good story concept, but is very poorly written and acted. I am AMAZED that all the rest of the reviews on this site for this show were so positive.Obviously, I disagree and would not recommend this show.",2,Crappy!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,1291,"['review', 'written', 'watching', 'first', '9', 'episodes', 'perhaps', 'improved', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'it.The', 'lead', 'actor', 'handsome', 'ZERO', 'personality', 'winning', 'smile', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'sense', 'humor', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'John', 'Doe', 'endless', 'knowledge', 'things', 'knowable', 'might', 'come', 'handy', 'occasion', 'police', 'most', 'part', 'completely', 'implausible', 'would', 'consult', 'top', 'crime', 'scenes', 'evidence', 'dead', 'bodies', 'ME', 'most', 'part', 'business', 'being', 'scenes', 'much', 'less', 'given', 'unrestricted', 'access', 'just', 'have', 'knowledge', ""n't"", 'make', 'detective', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Monk', 'observant', 'police', 'chief', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'when', 'interrogation', 'room', 'suspect.To', 'be', 'honest', 'only', 'reason', 'watched', 'many', 'episodes', 'was', 'pure', 'curiosity', 'identity', 'curiosity', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'continue', 'sit', 'more', 'crap', 'show', 'based', 'good', 'story', 'concept', 'very', 'poorly', 'written', 'acted', 'am', 'AMAZED', 'rest', 'reviews', 'site', 'show', 'were', 'so', 'positive.Obviously', 'disagree', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'show']",N/A
