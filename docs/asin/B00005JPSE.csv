656472,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B00005JPSE,Andrew Desmond,"[2, 2]","I had no idea what this film was about; nor, for that matter, have I ever read a Steven King novel.  Yes, I know that he writes horror stores but that is the extent of my knowledge.  So, I was surprised to find that I enjoyed ""1408"".The essence of the story is that Mike Enslin (John Cusack) plays a cynical writer who pens reviews of supposedly haunted hotel rooms.  And why wouldn't he be cynical?  Stories of haunted rooms are a dime a dozen and who believes in ghosts?  Well, certainly not Mike Enslin.After receiving some anonymous mail, Enslin books into room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan.  He is implored by the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) not to choose the room.  There have apparently been countless largely unexplained deaths in that very room.  Enslin, however, is a persistent man and he will not be convinced of the dangers.At first glance, the room seems totally unremarkable.  But, after a short time, strange and sometimes chilling things begin to happen.  I can say that at times I was given goose bumps.  This film is largely able to find that delicate balance between schlock and horror.  This is a rare achievement as the film industry is littered with movies that are often trapped by the former whilst forgetting the latter.Without spoiling the remaining plot of the film, there is an explanation for much of the various unexplained events.  Yet, it wouldn't be a good horror story without a twist in its tail.  And this one also has a good twist.  Enjoy!

656473,A38PC1H0VW52V4,B00005JPSE,Andy Meneses,"[0, 0]","Steven King has long been a favorite author of mine and 1408 is just another basic example of his work. I quite liked this movie adaptation but I have yet to read the original story. While the movie is not particularly scary, it certainly has a creepiness all its own. There a few twists and turns including one very big and...shall I say, misleading, one in the latter half of the film. My main concern with this movie on the other hand, is that it includes a lot of back-story and other plot elements that don't seem to flesh out or get explained at all by the end of the film1408's acting isn't really much to talk about but it is quite good nonetheless. John Cusack's character is a rather typical caricature of the cynical man who ""believes in nothing but himself"" and has a dry sarcastic comment for everything. The movie spends the largest amount of its time around Mike Enslin for obvious reasons. I haven't really seen him act in much else but he certainly does a good job in this movie especially since he was forced to act by himself and respond terrified to nothing. Samuel Jackson acts pretty much the same as he does in most of his movies but with significantly less yelling. The first exchange between the two characters in particular is a fine display of their acting talent.All together, 1408 is entertaining enough that a second view can be just as enjoyable as the first even after all the twists have been exposed. Eventually I'd like to see more Steven King adaptations but for now this is one of my favorites (second to Secret Window).

656475,A2I4VTPKGSQZ75,B00005JPSE,Anthony Hand,"[2, 2]","""1408"" is based on an original Stephen King short abandons for the most part the use of overt gore and jumpy ""boo"" scenes in a smart move away from a trend we've been seeing in some modern horror movies, such as ""The Hostel"" or ""Cabin Fever"". Don't get me wrong though, gore in a horror movie (or otherwise) can have its place, if it's done well and inserted properly. But some films just don't need it. ""1408"" is such a film and relies on spooky tension building to get its point across.The film, which received an 18 certificate in Britain and remarkably a PG-13 certificate in the US, stars the under-used John Cusack as Mike Enslin, a sardonic and cynical writer of paranormal debunking who checks into the Dolphin hotel in New York to embark on his latest project. The 1408 of the title is a room that has seen a large number of deaths, ranging from window jumpers to drowning in soup and the manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), is reluctant to let Enslin stay in it. Nobody has lasted more than an hour in room 1408, Olin informs Enslin and hands him a thick dossier on the people who have been driven insane to the point of their demise in the room.Enslin won't be deterred however and insists on staying the night, intent on proving that there is nothing supernatural about the room at all. After entering the room, he remains unconvinced for the better part of the first half of the movie, but the increasing level of strange goings-on help him to come to his senses. It seems Mike Ensln has finally found proof of the existence of the paranormal he is so dismissive of in his everyday life.The viewer is helped to believe this too, by the top marks effort of John Cusack, who for a great many scenes is completely alone. There is only him and the audience dealing with the ghostly occurrences playing out on the screen and Cusack does well to covey what Enslin is thinking and feeling, by not only making use of his great ability to deliver a timely wisecrack or deadpan one liner, but also convincingly performing his characters ever growing fear.A quietly unsettling Samuel L Jackson offers a sterling support performance in what I believe to be one of his better onscreen efforts and he does a lot to help build the foundations of the suspense that drives the first part of the film.Fine support also comes from Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony, who play Enslin's estranged wife and dead daughter, in the movie's sub-plot, which is one of the stronger elements of the production.The weaker sides to 1408, however, become apparent in the second half of the movie as the room's subtle attempts to drive Enslin nuts are replaced by the over the top. The ""turn down service"" toilet roll creepiness and spine tingling repetition of ""We've Only Just Begun"" on a clock radio give way to severe climate change and some on-location hallucinations that just aren't as effective as the events that actually take place within the confines of the hotel room. It's also clear that the producers were unsure how to finish the film, which has led to a number of alternative endings. The ""Director's cut"" DVD has replaced the ending in theatre's with the one that Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m originally wanted and there is also another ending involving Enslins publisher, Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub).Inevitably, there have been unfavourable comparisons to Stephen King's other hotel horror, ""The Shining"", but ""1408"" is a different creature altogether. Whereas Kubrick's ""The Shining"" kept me interested for its full running time, Hfstr&ouml;m's effort unfortunately trailed off after the 45 minute mark. This is a shame because the first half setup indicated a very enjoyable overall movie. But ""1408"" just runs out of steam and instead of driving smoothly to it's ending, it tumbles toward it, leaving the viewer unsure whether it was an wholly successful experience.",3,It's an evil f**king room.,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,3885,"['1408', 'based', 'original', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'abandons', 'most', 'part', 'use', 'overt', 'gore', 'jumpy', 'boo', 'scenes', 'smart', 'move', 'away', 'trend', ""'ve"", 'been', 'seeing', 'modern', 'horror', 'movies', 'such', 'Hostel', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'gore', 'horror', 'movie', 'otherwise', 'can', 'have', 'place', 'done', 'well', 'inserted', 'properly', 'films', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', '1408', 'film', 'relies', 'spooky', 'tension', 'building', 'get', 'point', 'across.The', 'film', 'received', '18', 'certificate', 'Britain', 'remarkably', 'PG-13', 'certificate', 'US', 'under-used', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'sardonic', 'cynical', 'writer', 'paranormal', 'debunking', 'who', 'Dolphin', 'hotel', 'New', 'York', 'embark', 'latest', 'project', '1408', 'title', 'room', 'seen', 'large', 'number', 'deaths', 'ranging', 'window', 'jumpers', 'drowning', 'soup', 'manager', 'hotel', 'Gerald', 'Olin', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'reluctant', 'let', 'Enslin', 'stay', 'Nobody', 'lasted', 'more', 'hour', 'room', '1408', 'Olin', 'Enslin', 'thick', 'dossier', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'insane', 'point', 'demise', 'room.Enslin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'deterred', 'however', 'staying', 'night', 'intent', 'proving', 'nothing', 'supernatural', 'room', 'entering', 'room', 'unconvinced', 'better', 'part', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'increasing', 'level', 'strange', 'goings-on', 'help', 'come', 'senses', 'Mike', 'Ensln', 'finally', 'found', 'proof', 'existence', 'paranormal', 'so', 'dismissive', 'everyday', 'life.The', 'viewer', 'helped', 'believe', 'too', 'top', 'marks', 'effort', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'great', 'many', 'scenes', 'completely', 'alone', 'only', 'audience', 'dealing', 'ghostly', 'occurrences', 'playing', 'out', 'screen', 'Cusack', 'well', 'covey', 'what', 'Enslin', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'not', 'only', 'making', 'use', 'great', 'ability', 'deliver', 'timely', 'wisecrack', 'deadpan', 'one', 'liner', 'also', 'convincingly', 'performing', 'characters', 'ever', 'growing', 'fear.A', 'quietly', 'unsettling', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'sterling', 'support', 'performance', 'what', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'onscreen', 'efforts', 'lot', 'help', 'build', 'foundations', 'suspense', 'first', 'part', 'film.Fine', 'support', 'also', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'Jasmine', 'Jessica', 'Anthony', 'who', 'play', 'Enslin', 'estranged', 'wife', 'dead', 'daughter', 'movie', 'sub-plot', 'one', 'stronger', 'elements', 'production.The', 'weaker', 'sides', '1408', 'however', 'become', 'apparent', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'room', 'subtle', 'attempts', 'drive', 'Enslin', 'nuts', 'are', 'replaced', 'top', 'turn', 'down', 'service', 'toilet', 'roll', 'creepiness', 'spine', 'tingling', 'repetition', ""'ve"", 'Only', 'Just', 'Begun', 'clock', 'radio', 'give', 'way', 'severe', 'climate', 'change', 'on-location', 'hallucinations', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'effective', 'events', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'confines', 'hotel', 'room', 'also', 'clear', 'producers', 'were', 'unsure', 'how', 'finish', 'film', 'led', 'number', 'alternative', 'endings', 'Director', 'cut', 'DVD', 'replaced', 'ending', 'theatre', 'one', 'Mikael', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'originally', 'wanted', 'also', 'ending', 'involving', 'Enslins', 'publisher', 'Sam', 'Farrell', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', '.Inevitably', 'have', 'been', 'unfavourable', 'comparisons', 'Stephen', 'King', 'other', 'hotel', 'horror', 'Shining', '1408', 'different', 'creature', 'altogether', 'Whereas', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'kept', 'interested', 'full', 'running', 'time', 'Hfstr', 'ouml', 'effort', 'unfortunately', 'trailed', 'off', '45', 'minute', 'mark', 'shame', 'first', 'half', 'setup', 'indicated', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'overall', 'movie', '1408', 'just', 'steam', 'instead', 'driving', 'smoothly', 'ending', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'unsure', 'was', 'wholly', 'successful', 'experience']",1408

There haven't been many that have pleased me; just The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and Stand By Me (The Body). I was never a fan of The Shining, film wise. That is just a story that should never be messed with because it's impossible to capture half of what's in the novel. But I digress. 1408 did for me what The Shining couldn't. Maybe it was John Cusack's awesome performance while alone for most of the movie, or maybe it was the element of horror mixed with that of true emotion from a parent who's lost a child.I'm not saying this film is perfect. Again I stress, IT'S A STEPHEN KING SHORT STORY.

After all the convincing that the guy should NOT stay in the room from Samuel L. Jackson's character, I was anticipating what kind of danger this room would hold.The creepy build up as the guy (who was a book writer by the way) was approaching the room while walking down the hotel hallway was quite good too, with an elevator opening by itself, and flies buzzing over the food on the plates that were sitting on a tray outside a hotel room.  You could sense an enormous danger right around the corner.Once the guy entered the room and started experiencing how insane the room really was, this is where the movie started to lose me... but only a little bit.A nice twist having the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun"" constantly playing on the alarm clock radio, haha.  I love that song.  The history of the band itself was a tragedy, though I don't think the movie directors intended the band to be the focus of the storyline- it was just a random song they chose that was appropriate for the film because of the song title and the beautiful melody of the vocals worked REALLY work in this kind of uncomfortable setting.Anyway, once the guy started getting comfortable inside the room (or rather, UNcomfortable) strange things began to happen.Of course this is a horror movie, so the suspense started off slow and builded gradually.  Once the guy realized something was terribly wrong (and arrogantly thought beforehand that NOTHING would happen to him) he started having hallucinations.  It was a REAL challenge trying to figure out what was real and what was just the guys hallucinations creeping in.  Of course the evil in the room was forcing the guy to have hallucinations quite often about his dead daughter and almost drowning in a ocean (and waking up near a beach) but it was REALLY confusing to me what was really happening and what wasn't.I also feel the movie went a little too far with the creepiness and the hallucinations of the room.  Come on, the ENTIRE room turns into a freezer suddenly as the guy almost freezes to death?  The ENTIRE room floods with water as he almost drowns?  It went WAY too far sometimes and the creepiness went away as a result.1408 is quite entertaining as far as the action is concerned- one great scene right after another, and the film certainly LOOKS really good.Well, the film does make more sense in its conclusion.  I might give this movie a higher rating the second time I watch it, but as it is, it could have been a classic had some exaggerated scenes never taken place.",4,"good, but could have been better",1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2848,"['ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'thrilled', '1408', 'most', 'people.The', 'movie', 'did', 'INCREDIBLE', 'job', 'beginning', 'building', 'up', 'suspense', 'hotel', 'room', 'main', 'character', 'wanted', 'stay', 'was', 'full', 'unexplainable', 'evil', 'had', 'dangerous', 'history', 'countless', 'deaths', 'years', 'previous', 'visitors', 'stayed', 'room', 'convincing', 'guy', 'should', 'NOT', 'stay', 'room', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'character', 'was', 'anticipating', 'what', 'kind', 'danger', 'room', 'would', 'hold.The', 'creepy', 'build', 'up', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'book', 'writer', 'way', 'was', 'approaching', 'room', 'walking', 'down', 'hotel', 'hallway', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'too', 'elevator', 'opening', 'flies', 'buzzing', 'food', 'plates', 'were', 'sitting', 'tray', 'hotel', 'room', 'could', 'sense', 'enormous', 'danger', 'right', 'corner.Once', 'guy', 'entered', 'room', 'started', 'experiencing', 'how', 'insane', 'room', 'really', 'was', 'where', 'movie', 'started', 'lose', 'only', 'little', 'bit.A', 'nice', 'twist', 'having', 'Carpenters', ""'ve"", 'Only', 'Just', 'Begun', 'constantly', 'playing', 'alarm', 'clock', 'radio', 'haha', 'love', 'song', 'history', 'band', 'was', 'tragedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'directors', 'intended', 'band', 'be', 'focus', 'storyline-', 'was', 'just', 'random', 'song', 'chose', 'was', 'appropriate', 'film', 'song', 'title', 'beautiful', 'melody', 'vocals', 'worked', 'REALLY', 'work', 'kind', 'uncomfortable', 'setting.Anyway', 'once', 'guy', 'started', 'getting', 'comfortable', 'room', 'rather', 'UNcomfortable', 'strange', 'things', 'began', 'happen.Of', 'course', 'horror', 'movie', 'suspense', 'started', 'off', 'slow', 'builded', 'gradually', 'guy', 'realized', 'something', 'was', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'arrogantly', 'thought', 'beforehand', 'NOTHING', 'would', 'happen', 'started', 'having', 'hallucinations', 'was', 'REAL', 'challenge', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'real', 'what', 'was', 'just', 'guys', 'hallucinations', 'creeping', 'course', 'evil', 'room', 'was', 'forcing', 'guy', 'have', 'hallucinations', 'quite', 'often', 'dead', 'daughter', 'almost', 'drowning', 'ocean', 'waking', 'up', 'beach', 'was', 'REALLY', 'confusing', 'what', 'was', 'really', 'happening', 'what', ""wasn't.I"", 'also', 'feel', 'movie', 'went', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'creepiness', 'hallucinations', 'room', 'Come', 'ENTIRE', 'room', 'freezer', 'suddenly', 'guy', 'almost', 'death', 'ENTIRE', 'room', 'floods', 'water', 'almost', 'drowns', 'went', 'WAY', 'too', 'far', 'sometimes', 'creepiness', 'went', 'away', 'result.1408', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'as', 'far', 'action', 'concerned-', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'right', 'film', 'certainly', 'LOOKS', 'really', 'good.Well', 'film', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'conclusion', 'might', 'give', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'second', 'time', 'watch', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'had', 'exaggerated', 'scenes', 'never', 'taken', 'place']",1408

He goes through life debunking ghost stories until he receives a strange invitation concerning room 1408 of New York's Dolphin Hotel. Determined to get his story he begins research on the room which has claimed over 50 lives. After arriving in New York he meets with hotel manager Gerard Olin (Samuel L.

Not heeding his advive Enslin enters the room for the night and strange things begin happening.The two disc version of the film contains two versions of the film: the original theatrical version and the extended director perferred cut which completely changes the ending);a somewhat slow moving commentary by Hafstrom and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski; two very short webisodes; deleted scenes with optional commentary and the standard making of featurette.While this may not be the best King adaptation around it does make for a better than average horror film dealing with topics not usually found in the genre including the loss of beliefs and isolation.

The man makes his living travelling back-and-forth across America, dubunking hotels with reputations for being haunted. So far, Enslin has never encountered anything more spooky in a room other than creaky floorboards or over-eager owners hoping to get a mention in one of his books. Thus it is only natural for him to be quite skeptical of the warnings from the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) about Room 1408. It seems that within the last hundred years over 50 people had died horrific deaths in that room. And, ever since one of the housekeepers gouged out her own eyes while alone in that room , not even hotel staff will work in there unless it is in pairs, at 10 minute intervals, keeping the door open at all times. As Olin puts it (delivered in classic Samuel L. Jackson style), ""Nobody has said anything about a ghost. I'm telling you it's just an evil motherf***ing room.""Enslin is too cynical a man to take any of this seriously (and we do have a horror movie to watch). But within minutes of entering 1408, when the bedside alarm clock begins playing the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun,"" and then proceeds to set itself into countdown mode for one hour, Enslin is beginning to think he finally just might have stumbled onto the real thing. Unfortunately and sadly for him.1408 is a horror film in the classic genre. A supernatural force of pure Evil undeniably possesses this room. Whatever -literally- is at play here, tears into Enslin's mind, finding his losses and regrets, and his own self-loathing to relentlessly attack him both physically and psychologically.

I expected a cleverly woven story of a mysterious room that had a fantastic story behind it which unravels throughout the movie.  That's not exactly it.  It is about a mysterious, devil of a room.  And not much else.  I also hoped to be frightened out of my wits but sadly it isn't that kind of a movie either.

Sam Jackson plays the hotel manager who tries to convince John to stay away from the room - 1408.  And John defies Sam's plea.  This was an awesome prelude to the main plot.  If the Jedi master tells you not to do something, it must be something scary.  Hence the more intriguing the room became (at least to me).For the rest of the film, it's a one man show by John Cusack and he pulls off quite a performance.

Such is the way that ""1408"" starts, an opening that inevitably leads to a series of nightmarish supernatural occurrences. But rather than bombarding the audience with cliched images of ghosts and monsters, the film effectively gets under the audience's skin by adding uncomfortable subtleties. Example: there's a moment when John Cusack passes a painting while in room 1408. He sees that it's slightly crooked. It wasn't like that when he first entered the room. Moments such as these build up as the film advances, resulting in a story that doesn't shock so much as it unnerves. In short, this is a film that takes us on one heck of a ride.And no wonder; it's based on the short story by Stephen King. In the collection ""Everything's Eventual,"" he introduces ""1408"" by saying, ""hotel rooms are just naturally creepy places, don't you think? I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many were losing their minds?"" I must admit that I don't put much thought into hotel rooms. Still, such unpleasant ideas ring true. The filmmakers must have known this; those very words were used as dialogue for Cusack's character Mike Enslin, a man who makes his living writing about reputedly haunted locations. Following the death of his daughter, he no longer believes in anything, least of all in ghosts. When he learns of New York City's Dolphin Hotel and the history behind room 1408 (whose digits add up to thirteen), he only sees it as an opportunity to add material to his next book. He intends to stay overnight.The manager of the hotel--Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson)--desperately tries to talk Enslin out of it, as such characters do in such stories. Room 1408 has been associated with many deaths during the Dolphin's ninety-plus year history: there was the sewing machine salesman that slit his own throat; there was the man that drowned in a bowl of soup; there was the woman that jumped from the room's window. Today, no one stays in room 1408. The only people who enter it are the maids, who give the room a very quick turn every month. The sheets are changed. The towels are replaced. The light bulbs are fixed. According to Olin, it's similar to holding your breath in a room filled with poison gas: everything has to be done quickly. This is because no one who stays in that room will last for more than an hour. Something is in that room. Not a ghost, but definitely something.Enslin listens but refuses to reconsider. He sees Olin's words as nothing more than scare tactics, a way to drum up publicity for the hotel. Olin insists that he's being quite serious. Whatever the case, Enslin eventually receives the key to room 1408, an old-fashioned metal key that fits into an old-fashioned lock (the hotel has upgraded to magnetic cards, but according to Olin, nothing electronic will work in 1408). The room is located on the fourteenth floor ... but actually, it isn't. During the elevator ride, Enslin notices that the floor numbers go from twelve directly to fourteen; apparently, a thirteenth floor is highly frowned upon in many hotels. Either way, Enslin enters room 1408.Thus begins a highly intense, horrific journey, highlighted by unexplainable occurrences, terrifying images, and otherworldly encounters. I won't bother describing them in detail: for one thing, it would be difficult to do so; for another thing, you really should experience this film for yourself. Let's be incredibly vague and say that many strange and frightening things happen, all of which force Enslin to reexamine his state of mind. For the horror movie aficionado, this film is delightfully unsettling, filled to the brim with pop out scares, spooky sounds, and startling twists of fate. At the same time, it utilizes smaller, quieter moments, such as when Enslin bathes the room in ultraviolet light, exposing large areas that were once covered with blood. In the hands of a lesser director, all this could have amounted to mere shock value, great to look at but lacking any substance.Luckily, there's genuine imagination at work in ""1408,"" so much so that it begins to get overwhelming. But that's how it should be; Enslin is learning the hard way, and the audience needs to be aware of this. Ultimately, I felt the same way leaving the theater as I did when finishing King's original story: thrilled. It doesn't matter that this film adaptation isn't completely faithful to its source; the story served more as a springboard than a strict guideline, allowing for many ideas to be expanded and solidified. When Cusack's strong performance is added to the mix, it gets even better; for most of the film, he had to act while alone in a hotel room, surrounded by a wealth of special effects. Nonetheless, he shows terrific range, relying on an emotional gamut that's just as convincing as it is intense.""1408"" is one of the better Stephen King adaptations of recent memory, a carefully crafted fright fest that knows how to make the audience uncomfortable. It's engaging, exciting, and genuinely terrifying, perfect for anyone in need of a good scare.",4,Hotel Hell,1182470400,"06 22, 2007",2007,5205,"['Haunted', 'Hotel', 'story', 'always', 'warning',

We have no idea what awaits us on the other side once we leave this mortal coil.It's also because of the unknown.As a species, we are instinctively are afraid of what we don't know. It presents an X-factor to us. We have no idea if it's going to harm or help us. So, it goes without saying we fear what awaits us after death because NO ONE KNOWS what will happen!Many people believe in ghosts. Spirits, poltergeists, phantoms, shades - just to name a few. Of course it has to be asked, what are these? Are they really the souls of the dearly departed who're unable to cross over because of some deed they've committed, something they left undone? Maybe they simply lost their way and haven't been able to find the light?Or maybe something is keeping them here.There are places all across the globe where ghosts are reputed to be. Homes, hospitals, battlefields... usually places of strong emotion or violence, and of course, death.Stephen King wrote a novel called 1408. It's about a writer dealing with his own personal demons (typical King type character), who makes a living writing about haunted locations.He's written a book about the ten most haunted hotels across the nation, and does research by going to these homes away from home and staying in them, in the rooms that are reportedly haunted.It's a means of income for not only him, but for the owners of these hotels. For some god only knows reason, there are people out there who are fascinated by hauntings and whenever he mentions these hotels, the bookings go up dramatically for the owners.Personally, I don't believe in Ghosts. I've never seen one, or for that matter had any supernatural encounters, even though several of my friends and even my wife have had these types of encounters. Frankly, I never want to have one.Am I afraid of these spectres? Damn straight! They're unknown, and thus, they could be dangerous. So I avoid any place where there are supposed ghosts.I digress.The writer learns of a hotel called the Dolphin in New York City where there is a room - 1408, that has a deadly history. Over Fifty guests have died in this room, and no one has lasted more than an hour.Obviously he's intrigued and decides that he has to see it. See, he's become jaded because of all the places he's visited and never once has had an encounter with the supernatural.  Just once he would like to encounter something.Despite the aggressive attempts of the hotel manager to persuade him to not stay in the room, he wins out and is given the key and settles in to wait for the fun to begin.I didn't find the movie particularly scary, although once he got into the room; I found it a little stressful - waiting for something to happen. That's the biggest thing for me, the wait. Once things start, then I relax.There was, thankfully, very little in the way of gore in the movie. It had a few of what you would call `jump' scares, where something happened suddenly and causes you to jump.Once the action started, I found it entertaining, and not in a bad way. It was fun watching the events unfold, and to see the malevolent spirit of the room come to life. Once the room has someone inside and the countdown begins that's it, they will not be allowed to leave.Alive that is.I won't deny that I found part of the movie to be very confusing, and at this point in time I'm still wondering what really happened to the poor unfortunate author who stayed in the room.I will not give away the ending for you, as you should see it for yourself.Half decent special effects, some truly chilling moments - over all, not bad, not overly scary. Good for a couple of hours of entertainment.As of this review, I haven't bothered with the special features, although the DVD is supposed to have cut scenes and an alternate ending. You'll have to check them out on your own and decide for yourself.2.5 out of 5",3,Entertaining but no substance,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,4037,"['What', 'cause', 'fear', 'Why', 'are', 'afraid', 'dark', 'Why', 'are', 'so', 'often', 'scared', 'going', 'unknown', 'places', 'simple', 'survival', 'fight', 'flight', 'instinct', 'fear', 'dying', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'other', 'side', 'leave', 'mortal', 'coil.It', 'also', 'unknown.As', 'species', 'are', 'instinctively', 'are', 'afraid', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'X-factor', 'have', 'idea', 'going', 'harm', 'help', 'So', 'saying', 'fear', 'what', 'death', 'NO', 'ONE', 'KNOWS', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Many', 'people', 'believe', 'ghosts', 'Spirits', 'poltergeists', 'phantoms', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'course', 'be', 'asked', 'what', 'are', 'Are', 'really', 'souls', 'dearly', 'departed', 'who', ""'re"", 'unable', 'cross', 'deed', ""'ve"", 'committed', 'something', 'left', 'undone', 'Maybe', 'simply', 'lost', 'way', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'find', 'light', 'maybe', 'something', 'keeping', 'are', 'places', 'globe', 'where', 'ghosts', 'are', 'reputed', 'be', 'Homes', 'hospitals', 'battlefields', 'usually', 'places', 'strong', 'emotion', 'violence', 'course', 'death.Stephen', 'King', 'wrote', 'novel', 'called', '1408', 'writer', 'dealing', 'own', 'personal', 'demons', 'typical', 'King', 'type', 'character', 'who', 'living', 'writing', 'about', 'haunted', 'locations.He', 'written', 'book', 'ten', 'most', 'haunted', 'hotels', 'nation', 'research', 'going', 'homes', 'away', 'home', 'staying', 'rooms', 'are', 'reportedly', 'means', 'income', 'not', 'only', 'owners', 'hotels', 'god', 'only', 'reason', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fascinated', 'hauntings', 'whenever', 'hotels', 'bookings', 'go', 'up', 'dramatically', 'owners.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Ghosts', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'one', 'matter', 'had', 'supernatural', 'encounters', 'even', 'several', 'friends', 'even', 'wife', 'have', 'had', 'types', 'encounters', 'Frankly', 'never', 'want', 'have', 'one.Am', 'afraid', 'spectres', 'Damn', 'straight', ""'re"", 'unknown', 'thus', 'could', 'be', 'dangerous', 'So', 'avoid', 'place', 'where', 'are', 'supposed', 'ghosts.I', 'digress.The', 'writer', 'learns', 'hotel', 'called', 'Dolphin', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'room', '1408', 'deadly', 'history', 'Fifty', 'guests', 'have', 'died', 'room', 'one', 'lasted', 'more', 'hour.Obviously', 'intrigued', 'see', 'See', 'become', 'jaded', 'places', 'visited', 'never', 'once', 'had', 'encounter', 'supernatural', 'Just', 'would', 'like', 'encounter', 'aggressive', 'attempts', 'hotel', 'manager', 'persuade', 'not', 'stay', 'room', 'out', 'given', 'key', 'settles', 'wait', 'fun', 'begin.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'particularly', 'scary', 'once', 'got', 'room', 'found', 'little', 'stressful', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'biggest', 'thing', 'wait', 'Once', 'things', 'start', 'then', 'relax.There', 'was', 'thankfully', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'gore', 'movie', 'had', 'few', 'what', 'would', 'call', 'jump', 'scares', 'where', 'something', 'happened', 'suddenly', 'jump.Once', 'action', 'started', 'found', 'entertaining', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'was', 'fun', 'watching', 'events', 'unfold', 'see', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'room', 'come', 'life', 'room', 'someone', 'inside', 'countdown', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'allowed', 'leave.Alive', 'is.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'found', 'part', 'movie', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'point', 'time', ""'m"", 'still', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'poor', 'unfortunate', 'author', 'who', 'stayed', 'room.I', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'should', 'see', 'yourself.Half', 'decent', 'special', 'effects', 'truly', 'chilling', 'moments', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'overly', 'scary', 'Good', 'couple', 'hours', 'entertainment.As', 'review', 'have', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'supposed', 'have', 'cut', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'ending', ""'ll"", 'have', 'check', 'out', 'own', 'decide', '5']",1408

But as bad as he's been getting, Stephen King can come up with a few effective books which turn out to be either really great (The Shining, The Green Mile), manageable (The Langoliers) or just simply awful (Dreamcatcher). 1408 may not be the best adaptation of one of his films but it's certainly the best in awhile.Michael Enslin is a writer who specializes in the most haunted places in America. Well at least if they were actually haunted since a lot of them have been disappointing and he's been growing increasingly cynical. But a curious postcard about the Dolphin Hotel in New York with the phrase ""Don't Enter 1408"" appears. This sparks his interest and despite the continued warnings from the hotel manager,Gerald Olin, he checks in. What initially begins as disbelief soon grows into a fear that the room may in fact be real.A lot of horror movies are based on the idea that you're not safe as long as the film's on and with good use of atmosphere and tension, the film just might make you lose sleep. However, films lately are built around the idea that seeing entrails and ""chunky goodness"" is meant to scare you. Well it doesn't, it disgusts so it's with welcome that 1408 doesn't follow this route. Well there's only so much scary stuff to go around but it's a good use of letting the viewer feel uneasy. It also helps that we never leave the main character to sort of deflate everything which is a big plus.But that means that main character better be awesome right? Well how can you expect less from John Cusack, one of the more reliable actors right now. He's always been great and here he shines as well, showing the cynicism, shock and tortured past that the character has without it feeling hammy or ""actor""-ish. The other main character is obviously Samuel L. Jackson (since he's on the cover, naturally) and Sam's always good but here he doesn't have much to do except for telling us how evil the room is. We also have Mary McCormack and Tony Shalhoub with only Mary being anything close to a full character.With the Mist coming from Green Mile director and Cell from Hostel director Eli Roth (ugh) coming, it seems either people are seeing how effective a Stephen King story can be under a good director it's just simply the thing to do lately but luckily 1408 is as good a horror film out this year as any.",4,An effective little chiller,1191283200,"10 2, 2007",2007,2647,"['One', 'friends', 'huge', 'fan', 'recent', 'onslaught', 'horror', 'films', 'namely', 'center', 'gore', 'Saw', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'remake', 'prequel', 'center', '10', 'jump', 'scenes', 'meant', 'scare', 'seat', 'really', 'show', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bite', 'first', 'place', 'needed', 'jumps', 'as', 'bad', 'been', 'getting', 'Stephen', 'King', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'few', 'effective', 'books', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'either', 'really', 'great', 'Shining', 'Green', 'Mile', 'manageable', 'Langoliers', 'just', 'simply', 'awful', 'Dreamcatcher', '1408', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'adaptation', 'one', 'films', 'certainly', 'best', 'awhile.Michael', 'Enslin', 'writer', 'who', 'most', 'haunted', 'places', 'America', 'Well', 'least', 'were', 'actually', 'haunted', 'lot', 'have', 'been', 'disappointing', 'been', 'growing', 'increasingly', 'cynical', 'curious', 'postcard', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'New', 'York', 'phrase', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Enter', '1408', 'interest', 'continued', 'warnings', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Gerald', 'Olin', 'What', 'initially', 'disbelief', 'soon', 'fear', 'room', 'may', 'fact', 'be', 'real.A', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'idea', ""'re"", 'not', 'safe', 'as', 'long', 'film', 'good', 'use', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'film', 'just', 'might', 'make', 'lose', 'sleep', 'However', 'films', 'lately', 'are', 'built', 'idea', 'seeing', 'entrails', 'chunky', 'goodness', 'meant', 'scare', 'Well', ""n't"", 'welcome', '1408', ""n't"", 'follow', 'route', 'Well', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'scary', 'stuff', 'go', 'around', 'good', 'use', 'letting', 'viewer', 'feel', 'uneasy', 'also', 'never', 'leave', 'main', 'character', 'sort', 'deflate', 'everything', 'big', 'plus.But', 'main', 'character', 'better', 'be', 'awesome', 'right', 'Well', 'how', 'can', 'expect', 'less', 'John', 'Cusack', 'one', 'more', 'reliable', 'actors', 'right', 'now', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'cynicism', 'shock', 'tortured', 'character', 'feeling', 'hammy', 'actor', '-ish', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'obviously', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'cover', 'naturally', 'Sam', 'always', 'good', 'here', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'telling', 'how', 'room', 'also', 'have', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'Tony', 'Shalhoub', 'only', 'Mary', 'being', 'anything', 'close', 'full', 'character.With', 'Mist', 'coming', 'Green', 'Mile', 'director', 'Cell', 'Hostel', 'director', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'ugh', 'coming', 'people', 'are', 'seeing', 'how', 'effective', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'director', 'just', 'simply', 'thing', 'do', 'lately', 'luckily', '1408', 'as', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'year']",1408

First off, I wouldn't really call this a horror movie. It's more of a mystery/ghost-story.***SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER BUT NOT REALLY***John Cusack dominates the entire movie with stone-faced brilliance in a way only he can. But the thing that makes this movie so awesome is that you never really know if he's imagining what's happening to him or if it's real. The movie really keeps you guessing until the very end and even then it's kind of left somewhat up in the air.  It is apparent as the movie gets going that Cusack's character has his own inner demons he needs to face down, and it's growingly ambiguous whether or not the ""ghosts"" he faces in that room are his own, or the room's.  It's all very psychologically driven, so hardcore horror fans who love the fast-paced gorefest will probably be bored by this movie.Also, I notice a lot of people who negatively review the movie claim that the scares in it are cheap and run-of-the-mill. For me personally, I think Stephen King worked it this way on purpose. I mean he's Stephen King for crying out loud; he's the horror genius. You don't think he can think of better or more original scares than to make the walls drip blood? Cusack's character is a jaded not-easily-scared writer, so all these cheap B-movie horror-flick type scare shots are just there to test his belief system. Because when King wants to scare you, or at least make you feel eerie, he accomplishes it.I took off one star because I thought they could've done better if they'd made the film an R-rating. Not to mention, and again this is a kind of a spoiler, that Samuel L. Jackson's role is totally ambiguous, even the room itself is totally ambiguous. So it's his inner demons then? Then why'd the room kill all those other people? The end is totally unclear, for my dumb brain at least. So that's why I took off a star.***REAL UNAMBIGUOUS SPOILER AHEAD***All in all, what few reviewers seem to mention or notice is that this is much more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It has that same psychological element that the Saw movies do, for me at least, in that they force the character(s) to brave something terrible to realize how much they want to live. Cusack's character was like the walking dead before he met that room. That room forced him to face his demons and realize that he wants to live, REALLY live.

656508,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B00005JPSE,DanD,"[3, 4]","When it comes to horror movies, I'm skeptical.  Especially when they're based on the works of authors I admire.  When it comes to horror writing, Stephen King is above par--he is the guy you compare all others to.  There have been some wonderful adaptations of his novels; there have been some horrendous adaptations as well.  Fortunately for all concerned, ""1408"" fits snugly into the former category.Mike Enslin is a non-believer.  No ghosts, no goolies, not even a god.  He's searching, though; he looks everywhere for evidence of the paranormal, but has yet to see a glimpse.  Then he gets word of the Dolphin.  And room 1408.  He's warned to stay away.  The manager bribes him with expensive liquor.  But Mike doesn't listen.  And once he enters 1408, he has one hour to live.This movie creeped me out.  I say that so bluntly because movies rarely creep me out.  ""The Exorcist"" does it.  ""Jaws"" does it.  A couple others, perhaps, but not many.  Of course you have your genuine shock moments--turn around and a guy slashes with a knife, some creep-o pops out of a ventilation shaft.  But true horror is atmospheric; and what's more atmospheric than a dingy, supposedly haunted hotel room?If nothing else, ""1408"" shows that John Cusack has what it takes to carry a movie by himself.  Don't get me wrong--the acting is great.  Samuel L. Jackson's performance is top-notch; his scene with Cusack in the office is tremendously entertaining.

They were surly. One spilled coffee on you, and that was the nice one: the other managed to ignore your call button all the way from the badlands over Nevada to Logan.And anyway, nowadays flying business is like renting a timeshare in Dante's 8th circle of Hell: fat men on the left of you flu victim on the right of you, into the jaws of death sat the 500!One rough cab ride through a tangle of dubious streets later, you're checked in to your sanctuary, your beachhead, your staging point & command center for the busy week ahead. You're wiped out. You want to get out of your oxfords, pad around in comfy clothes, pajamas maybe, fix yourself a little pot of that in-room coffee, brush your teeth, flop on the bed.You fumble with the magnetic key, the door makes a little hiss and opens inward---GASP!---your mind reels in shock, horror, agony!They said a double-king----this sad excuse for a bed looks like something out of summer camp!The room is the size of a broom closet! There's no mini-bar! There is zero shower pressure! And worse---the whole place reeks of stale cigarette smoke! They promised you a NON-SMOKING room!Man I'm telling you, when you're a business traveller, hotel rooms can really be a killer.But that's nothing compared to the Killer with wall-to-wall carpeting masquerading as an innocent little 40 x 40 square of Manhattan commercial real estate in the new Stevie King adaptation ""1408"".It's a killer. A legendary killer, an oubliette of murder & madness relegated to the Bad Old History of the Dolphin Hotel, responsible for 56 deaths over its busy little lifespan: murders, suicides, hangings, stabbings, the works.It is crouched, waiting in the stale, inky darkness, waiting for meat. It hasn't had a victim in years because the hotel keeps it locked up, recondite, no vacancy---ever. I imagine it's pretty hungry.All it needs is an occupant, and a little room to work its magic. Let's start with the idea, which is King's in one sense (the viciously haunted hotel-room), but universal in another: hotel rooms, consummately transient places, are singularly creepy.I remember many times sleepwalking among the blocky, startling objects standing their ground in unfamiliar quarters: muttering to myself, fumbling at my lock, bumping into strange arrangements of stale-smelling curtains and furniture. How many times do you think someone has gone a-roving in the deep nightland of dreams and snapped his neck because of the hotel room's unfamiliar topography?Second is the setup and build, which is masterfully, deliciously done here: Samuel L. Jackson spins his gruesome little tale in grim counterpoint to Cusack's masterfully apathetic fencing, and this well-appointed little duel nicely sets the mood and pulled me in for a brutal little night of ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties. It's a nice, classic, atmospheric build---but it did something else I hadn't expected.It made me nervous.So to begin with, I'm keyed up. I'm tense.Director Mikael Hafstrom, working on first US film, gave me the crawls: the voices shrieking random nubmers and cryptic threats over the phone, that dull throb of despair, of nihilistic horror, the certainty that the universe is vast and endless and impersonal and cares not a whit about your fleeting, purposeless little life. That's evil.And for about 45 minutes, I have to give 1408 credit for giving me a good case of the crawls. Hafstrom creates, remarkably, a very visual sense of disorientation that works its way to a kind of paranoid vertigo. His malign Room plays all sorts of diabolic little tricks on Cusack at first, creating the sneaking suspicious that someone's in the room, in the vent, leading to a nasty little game of hide-and-seek---in which you really don't want to find out what's doing the Hiding.Even the nervous little battle of wills with a faulty A/C---when the repairman (champ vet actor Isiah Whitlock) refuses to cross the threshold and instead walks Cusack through the repair, I'm thinking ""smart man.""But in the end, it's all for naught. Like any hotel room, much of the charm wears off about halfway through your stay. Watching the insidious, nihilistic, world-hating evil thing holed up in Room 1408 drive John Cusack mad: intriguing, only because you're not sure exactly what the room will cook up. Seeing big cracks ripple up through the wall and blood pour out, or the room explode, or a big vast icy tundra appear---I've seen that before. About the time you see the jumping ghost (man, talk about a depressing spirit), the movie is headed to Dullsville.Take my advice: on this one, get an early wakeup call---and take plan on checking out early. Trust me: you'll thank me for it in the morning.JSG",2,Do not Disturb.,1184803200,"07 19, 2007",2007,4937,"['Man', 'what', 'call', 'room', 'service', 'OK', 'imagine', ""'ve"", 'flown', 'red-eye',

I saw this in the theater and thought it was worth getting the DVD when it came out.  A haunted hotel room is not an original premise by any means......but like most over-played movie themes (such as vampires or super heroes or cops), it's what you do with it that matters.  John Cusack plays a writer (did anyone else notice S. King does too many stories where a writer is the main protagonist?) who investigates supposedly haunted places, hoping to expose them as hoaxes while still writing scary stuff to sell books.  He goes to a hotel after receiving a warning to stay out of Room 1408.  He doesn't expect to find much, and is brutally, unpleasantly surprised.  The special effects are great!  John C. does a wonderful job portraying the cynical, uninspired writer with unresolved personal issues of his own.  Samuel L. Jackson is great as the hotel administrator who tries to dissuade the writer from spending the night in the forbidden room.  All around, the acting is strong, more than enhancing a 4-star script.  There are some good things here, some of which are fairly original.  It's a reasonably scary movie.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","The secret to good horror is not gore and gratuitous violence; good horror is about a tight, gripping, tense story that finds its protagonist not confronted by wave after wave of meat cleaver violence, but confronted by the sheer terror that has been planted in his mind.  Accordingly, 1408 was quite the treat; I caught this film on cable and instantly was attracted to the story of a writer who doesn't believe in the supernatural, and writes stories basically debunking paranormal occurrences, getting scared out of his gourd while staying in the infamous Room 1408 of the (fictional) Dolphin Hotel in New York.  And Room 1408 throws the proverbial kitchen sink at the writer, almost from the moment he checks in--from faucets exploding super hot water to blood oozing from the walls.  And during the haunting the writer (played masterfully by John Cusack) is forced to confront, and relive, the most painful experience in his life.Cusack is completely believable as paranormal author Mike Enslin.  The actor brings the right mix of skepticism, incredulity, and self-deprecating humor to this role.  Mike Enslin is becoming a believer in the supernatural right before our eyes, and is it ever fun to watch.  Samuel Jackson is his usual antagonistic best playing the manager of the Dolphin Hotel who tries, without success, to convince Enslin not to go to Room 1408.  It's a surprisingly small role, but Jackson brings his usual in-your-face vigor.

This film is one of the better ones. It is an adaptation of one of his short stories, a pretty straightforward tale about an ""evil"" hotel room and a skeptical horror writer's brief stay in it.There is no gore, little blood, and little in the way of shocks. If those are your requirements for a horror film, you had best stay away. It is closer to a psychological thriller than a typical horror movie. It is essentially a one-man show and John Cusack as the writer acquits himself admirably. He is the quintessential everyman that we find in all of Stephen King's books. Actually the character could almost be King himself. The scene in the bookshop where he goes to promote his new book is pretty funny and reminiscent of something that King himself experienced in Australia when he was chased out of a local bookstore by clueless store-clerks who thought he was a vandal defacing their merchandise. The film is a fine mix of comedy and horror. Witness Cusack's cynical and deadpan ""That's it?"" when he first enters the much-hyped room 1408, followed by the room's welcoming ditty ""We've Only Just Begun"" sung by the golden-voiced Karen Carpenter.The version to get is the 2-disc Collector's Edition. This is the only way you'll get to see the ""Director's Cut"" which is found on Disc 2. It also includes an engaging commentary from Swedish director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m and writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. The Director's Cut is about 8 minutes longer and contains several new and extended scenes as well as a very different ending. Neither version is similar to the original short story. Hfstr&ouml;m explains why the ending was changed - test audiences didn't like the original ending. Hfstr&ouml;m claims that he eventually grew to prefer the ending of the theatrical cut but after watching both, my preference is for the darker ending of the original. In either case, there is no happy-ever-after. I found the original darker ending to be more in keeping with the logic of the film but from test screenings it would seem that most viewers would prefer something lighter. You can compare for yourself on this double-disc set. There are also 11-minutes worth of deleted scenes with Hfstr&ouml;m explaining why they were removed and about a half-hour's worth of production featurettes. At just $3 more than the single-disc standard edition, the Collector's set is the one to go for.",4,Fine adaptation of Stephen King short story...

Jackson had little  more than a walk-on in one scene, not anywhere near enough to warrant co-star  billing. He did well with the little he had to do. My problem with the film was that all the artificiality was showing, that is, it was like watching the rehearsals for a play, seeing all the backstage business, and reading the script while seeing the production falling into place.  I never was led to believe that this was a movie of a NYC hotel in which  a lot of stage business was going on.. Perhaps a better analogy is that of a magicians assistant who knows the mechanics behind every trip.In sum, I can't say for sure, but there is a good chance that a fan of this kind of  movie is not going to be able to take it very seriously.

656521,A6LUXI8I8BU6P,B00005JPSE,"D Strick ""Entertainment D""","[2, 4]","1480 starts out with an interesting enough premise.  Semi-famous true haunting writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) who doesn't really believe in hauntings finally stays in the wrong haunted room.  But the twist is that the room isn't haunted in the traditional sense.  The room itself is some sort of malevolent being that loves to torture, drive mad and eventually kill its residents.Interesting enough - and we get to see Mike first in a non-haunted setting and see his method of taking notes into a recorder as he researches each location.  Then one mysterious post card invitation later and we get to some truly creepy dialog by a very determined hotel manager played by Sam Jackson who tries his best to discourage our writer from staying in 1408.  The acting here shines and really draws the viewer in and makes them ready for a truly scary ride.  Mr. Jackson's performance is subtle but his descriptions of what the room has done to its various residents are chilling and his sincere desire to keep Mike from staying in that room had me thinking anyone would be a fool to stay there after this conversation.  But then we wouldn't have a movie.BEWARE SPOILERS MAY BE AHEADThe stay in the room starts off strongly enough with a slow build as the radio blares and the clock becomes a count down timer and maybe there's someone in the room (!).  We meet a very smart repair man who refuses to come into the room but rather talks Mike through how to fix his thermostat then beats it out of there.  Closing the door (maybe for the last time) he slowly comes to realize he is trapped in 1408 and it's out to get him.  But alas this is where a derailment occurs.The room starts a campaign to drive Mike mad.  It works very suddenly as he almost immediately claims he's hallucinating and that the manager must have drugged his booze.  Much dialog becomes almost incoherent ramblings into his tape player.  The room plays increasingly random seeming and inane tricks that almost become funny instead of scary.  Ha! Smashed your hand!  Ha! Burned you with the water! Ha! You are here... the only room in existence, no escape!  Ha! Here's some random clown looking guy slashing at you!  Ha! It's hot!  Now it's freezing!  The only really impactful thing it does is make him relive scenes of his young daughter dying which really is mean.Then 1408 becomes omnipotent and bends time and space and in an easily predictable move sends Mike out to a point where he'd almost drowned earlier in the movie (seriously didn't you think it odd to have this almost drowned scene back then and nothing made of it?).  Then in a double clich&eacute;, after thinking he has been out of the room a few days he's really not (predictable again) but has a toothpick to prove he was out.  The room also brings his daughter back to him so that he can experience her death again (some of the first emotion I'd felt in a bit of movie time)which again is just really mean.And this aside from the randomness that the movie delves into after a point is one of the main things that pulled me out of the movie.  The room has proven to be almost all powerful, changing physics, inducing visions, replaying the past, conversing via hotel phone, filling itself with snow and water, sending false video messaging images of Mike to his estranged wife, bending space time and bringing the dead back to life and it can't stop Mike from setting it on fire?  You can argue that it was all in Mike's head maybe but the movie disproves that notion right at the end (theatrical cut).It was a strong start and interesting premise but just lost all menace along the way.",2,Not a Great Stay,1232064000,"01 16, 2009",2009,3619,"['1480', 'out', 'interesting', 'enough', 'premise', 'Semi-famous', 'true', 'haunting', 'writer', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'hauntings', 'finally', 'wrong', 'haunted', 'room', 'twist', 'room', ""n't"", 'haunted', 'traditional', 'sense', 'room', 'sort', 'malevolent', 'being', 'torture', 'drive', 'mad', 'eventually', 'kill', 'residents.Interesting', 'enough', 'get', 'see', 'Mike', 'first', 'non-haunted', 'setting', 'see', 'method', 'taking', 'notes', 'recorder', 'location', 'Then', 'one', 'mysterious', 'post', 'card', 'invitation', 'later', 'get', 'truly', 'creepy', 'dialog', 'very', 'determined', 'hotel', 'manager', 'played', 'Sam', 'Jackson', 'who', 'best', 'discourage', 'writer', 'staying', '1408', 'acting', 'here', 'shines', 'really', 'draws', 'viewer', 'ready', 'truly', 'scary', 'ride', 'Mr.', 'Jackson', 'performance', 'subtle', 'descriptions', 'what', 'room', 'done', 'various', 'residents', 'are', 'chilling', 'sincere', 'desire', 'keep', 'Mike', 'staying', 'room', 'had', 'thinking', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'fool', 'stay', 'there', 'conversation', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie.BEWARE', 'SPOILERS', 'MAY', 'BE', 'AHEADThe', 'stay', 'room', 'strongly', 'enough', 'slow', 'build', 'radio', 'blares', 'clock', 'count', 'down', 'timer', 'maybe', 'someone', 'room', 'meet', 'very', 'smart', 'repair', 'man', 'who', 'come', 'room', 'rather', 'talks', 'Mike', 'how', 'fix', 'thermostat', 'then', 'Closing', 'door', 'maybe', 'last', 'time', 'slowly', 'realize', 'trapped', '1408', 'out', 'get', 'where', 'derailment', 'occurs.The', 'room', 'campaign', 'drive', 'Mike', 'mad', 'very', 'suddenly', 'almost', 'immediately', 'hallucinating', 'manager', 'must', 'have', 'drugged', 'booze', 'Much', 'dialog', 'almost', 'incoherent', 'ramblings', 'tape', 'player', 'room', 'increasingly', 'random', 'seeming', 'inane', 'tricks', 'almost', 'become', 'funny', 'instead', 'scary', 'Ha', 'Smashed', 'hand', 'Ha', 'Burned', 'water', 'Ha', 'are', 'here', 'only', 'room', 'existence', 'escape', 'Ha', 'Here', 'random', 'clown', 'looking', 'guy', 'slashing', 'Ha', 'hot', 'Now', 'freezing', 'only', 'really', 'impactful', 'thing', 'make', 'relive', 'scenes', 'young', 'daughter', 'dying', 'really', 'mean.Then', '1408', 'omnipotent', 'bends', 'time', 'space', 'easily', 'predictable', 'move', 'sends', 'Mike', 'out', 'point', 'where', ""'d"", 'almost', 'drowned', 'earlier', 'movie', 'seriously', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'almost', 'drowned', 'scene', 'back', 'then', 'nothing', 'made', 'Then', 'double', 'clich', 'eacute', 'thinking', 'been', 'room', 'few', 'days', 'really', 'not', 'predictable', 'again', 'toothpick', 'prove', 'was', 'out', 'room', 'also', 'daughter', 'back', 'so', 'can', 'experience', 'death', 'again', 'first', 'emotion', ""'d"", 'felt', 'bit', 'movie', 'time', 'again', 'just', 'really', 'mean.And', 'aside', 'randomness', 'movie', 'point', 'one', 'main', 'things', 'pulled', 'movie', 'room', 'proven', 'be', 'almost', 'powerful', 'changing', 'physics', 'inducing', 'visions', 'replaying', 'past', 'conversing', 'hotel', 'phone', 'filling', 'snow', 'water', 'sending', 'false', 'video', 'messaging', 'images', 'Mike', 'estranged', 'wife', 'bending', 'space', 'time', 'bringing', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Mike', 'setting', 'fire', 'can', 'argue', 'was', 'Mike', 'head', 'maybe', 'movie', 'notion', 'right', 'end', 'theatrical', 'cut', '.It', 'was', 'strong', 'start', 'interesting', 'premise', 'just', 'lost', 'menace', 'way']",1408
656522,A5QCKO0LL1D5E,B00005JPSE,dv_forever,"[5, 6]","Hey there, Blu-ray fans! Ok, the Blu-ray of 1408 doesn't have many reviews so I'll come on and inform you of the product as I have this baby in my collection.First off... the controversy. This disc has the director's cut ending as part of the film and no you can't change it to the theatrical cut. The theatrical ending is included as an additional scene but you can't incorporate it into the movie itself. There is also a third ending that you can view as an additional scene too.So to make it absolutely clear, if you are buying this Blu-ray you are buying the director's cut of the film, which equates to just a little extension of a couple of scenes, nothing major there but the big qualm is the director's cut ending which is completely different from what you watched in the movie theater, ( if you indeed saw it in the theater that is ).I did see the film in the theater and I will describe the different endings in detail so turn away if you haven't seen the film and jump forward a few paragraphs to where I have written ""end of spoilers"".SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS!The original theatrical ending had John Cusack's character surviving the hotel fire and reuniting with his wife. He still can't comprehend his experience but he is moving on. One day while looking through his old possessions he finds his tape recorder that he had with him in the hotel room, listens to it and hears the voice of the spirit of his dead daughter. This confirms that there is more beyond death and this supposedly gives the Cusack character some piece of mind.This ending is restrained, not a typical happy ending, even though the main character lives. I enjoyed it very much as I saw it in the movie theater and was shocked to discover when I rented the original DVD, that the director's cut contained a totally new ending. And here is that ending...Cusack dies in the hotel fire, there is a funeral, his wife, now a widow is there, so is his editor played by Tony Shalhoub. Sam Jackson stops by to deliver some of Cusack's belongings to the widow. She does not want them so Jackson goes to his car, plays the burned tape recorder and hears the ghostly voice of Cusack's daughter. Alarmed by this, Jackson gets the scare of his life as he sees the burnt up zombie corpse of Cusack in the rear-view mirror staring at him! A cheap and ridiculous scare typical of horror flicks! Then Jackson turns around to find no one there. The locale changes and we are back to the burnt down, closed hotel where Cusack died. We see his ghost near the window looking out, he hears the call of his dead daughter's voice and goes out of our view. Ostensibly he is now a ghost forever trapped with his daughter's ghost or a representation of it in the burnt down hotel. Whatever.This ending was cheap and lame but the director probably thought killing the main character would be more edgy! Nonsense. The theatrical cut was just fine, far more refined and subtle.The third ending involves the editor played by Tony Shalhoub. His role in the film was a glorified cameo so this extra scene is ok to watch once. He receives the new manuscript from the dead Cusack character. Reading it he is freaked out by how bizarre it is. End of film.END OF SPOILERSClearly the original theatrical conclusion is the best of the three possibilities but the director or the studio or both have arrogantly conspired to shove this down people's throats or perhaps use it as an excuse to double dip this Blu-ray in the future. This is still a highly watchable, entertaining film and this blemish doesn't spoil what is actually one of the best Stephen King adaptations in many years. The first two-thirds of the film are especially riveting, the build-up to entering the hotel room, the long narrative arc of staying in this hellish environment... Cusack is terrific here, playing for almost an hour practically by himself. Outstanding build up of tension. The film loses momentum and goes off the rails in the last third and then we get this annoying director's cut ending. The point of the whole film is that this angry, lonely man just wants a tiny confirmation of the supernatural so that he can have piece of mind over his daughter's death. If he can find evidence of a supernatural realm, there may indeed be a God and a point and purpose to life after all and that his daughter's death was not in vain. Of course he gets more than he bargained for! The original theatrical ending really worked in the context of the themes I have summarized. The director's cut version is more nihilistic and ridiculous. Overall still worth it if you're not attached to the theatrical ending and since I bought this Blu-ray I guess I'm not.The picture quality is mostly very good with high contrast in the daylight scenes which look appropriately gorgeous here on Blu-ray. The more dimly lit interiors are also a joy to behold and the great cinematography gives this Blu-ray a lot to work with. A famous Blu-ray reviewing website reported that this transfer has pumped, oversaturated colors. I only found that in a few instances with some of the textures having a plasticky appearance but overall I had no major disappointments with this transfer.The audio has a True HD 5.1 track which is great as well a standard 5.1 Dolby track that is also very fine.The extras contain a very informative audio commentary by the director and the co-screenwriters. Then there are the typical featurettes, some promotional fluff, deleted scenes and the aforementioned alternate endings. All in all, this Blu-ray is a solid purchase if you are not too attached to the theatrical ending. And if you've never seen this film, then you may not care at all and enjoy the director's preferred conclusion! So then, that's it.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","The chief problem with all of 1408 remains the chief problem with most 'ghost'-based films: once you're absolutely certain that you're dealing with a ghost/spirit/evil-presence, etc., how much longer CAN you suspend your disbelief?Based on a Stephen King short story (could you possibly have been expecting a happy ending?), 1408 revolves around a faithless paranormal author Mike Enslin, played perfectly by John Cusack.  Enslin writes books about the alleged 'haunts' across America, spending the night in haunted hotels to debunk the supposed ghostly experience.  He's a professional cynic -- a writer who believes in what he can see, not what he's been told -- and he's out to prove, essentially, that there's no such thing as an afterlife.  After receiving a bump on the head from a surfing accident, Enslin receives a mysterious postcard from an anonymous fan warning him to avoid staying in Room 1408 of the upscale Dolphin Hotel.  Intrigued moreso with the opportunity to debunk yet one more contemporary urban myth, he immediately books the room for one night ... and what a night it turns out to be.1408 (the room, not the movie) is occupied (not only with weary travelers, but also something far more ominous): 1408 is evil itself, receiving its marching orders from the deepest, darkest fears of the boarders themselves.  At first, the room greets Enslin with precisely the antics anyone would expect -- weird noises, weird appearances, and other general weirdness ... but, before his stay is over, evil itself will have looked deep into the writer's heart and soul, bringing to the surface only those memories that can crack an already fragile human psyche.Where the film excels is the performance of John Cusack.  As Mike Enslin, he embodies the writer with a sense of curiosity coupled with hints of disbelief.  Cusack's scenes with Samuel L Jackson (the hotel's manager, who primarily serves to set-up the history of the legendary room, no doubt 'sounding' like John Cusack's inner voice at a time when the writer truly believed in what he was reporting) are brilliant; they perfectly draw Enslin (and the viewer) deeper and deeper into the mystery of the Dolphin Hotel, and the verbal banter shows how well Cusack holds his ground as an actor against his learned peers.Where the film fails (or stumbles, at least) is what I stated in my lead paragraph: once you know what you're dealing with -- that the room is evil, that its peeling back the layers of Enslin's life and darkest tragedies -- at what point can the viewer believe in what he's seeing?  The crux of any good ghost story is maintaining the level of interest for the viewer.  Things that go bump in the night are only scary for so long, but 1408 is about things that go bump in the M-I-N-D, events that alter one's life, events that inspire despair and longing instead of enforcing hope and humanity.  While Cusack's performance lifts the film higher than the typical spook tale, I personally (and it's always a matter of taste) didn't find the story to be a fitting counterpoint.  It's a good entry into a rarely effectively explored sub-genre of the ghost story; on that point, the film's worth a viewing.",3,"Cusack Soars, Film Sinks",1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,3187,"['chief', 'problem', '1408', 'chief', 'problem', 'most', ""'ghost'-based"", 'films', 'once', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'certain', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'ghost/spirit/evil-presence', 'etc.', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'CAN', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'been', 'expecting', 'happy', 'ending', '1408', 'faithless', 'paranormal', 'author', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'played', 'perfectly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Enslin', 'books', 'alleged', ""'haunts"", 'America', 'spending', 'night', 'haunted', 'hotels', 'debunk', 'supposed', 'ghostly', 'experience', 'professional', 'cynic', 'writer', 'who', 'what', 'can', 'see', 'not', 'what', 'been', 'told', 'out', 'prove', 'essentially', 'such', 'thing', 'afterlife', 'receiving', 'bump', 'head', 'surfing', 'accident', 'Enslin', 'mysterious', 'postcard', 'anonymous', 'fan', 'warning', 'avoid', 'staying', 'Room', '1408', 'upscale', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'Intrigued', 'moreso', 'opportunity', 'debunk', 'yet', 'one', 'more', 'contemporary', 'urban', 'myth', 'immediately', 'books', 'room', 'one', 'night', 'what', 'night', 'out', 'be.1408', 'room', 'not', 'movie', 'occupied', 'not', 'only', 'weary', 'travelers', 'also', 'something', 'far', 'more', 'ominous', '1408', 'evil', 'receiving', 'marching', 'orders', 'deepest', 'darkest', 'fears', 'boarders', 'first', 'room', 'greets', 'Enslin', 'precisely', 'antics', 'anyone', 'would', 'expect', 'weird', 'noises', 'weird', 'appearances', 'other', 'general', 'weirdness', 'stay', 'evil', 'will', 'have', 'looked', 'deep', 'writer', 'heart', 'soul', 'bringing', 'surface', 'only', 'memories', 'can', 'crack', 'already', 'fragile', 'human', 'psyche.Where', 'film', 'excels', 'performance', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'writer', 'sense', 'curiosity', 'coupled', 'hints', 'disbelief', 'Cusack', 'scenes', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'hotel', 'manager', 'who', 'primarily', 'set-up', 'history', 'legendary', 'room', 'doubt', ""'sounding"", 'John', 'Cusack', 'inner', 'voice', 'time', 'when', 'writer', 'truly', 'believed', 'what', 'was', 'reporting', 'are', 'brilliant', 'perfectly', 'draw', 'Enslin', 'viewer', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'mystery', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'verbal', 'banter', 'how', 'well', 'Cusack', 'ground', 'actor', 'learned', 'peers.Where', 'film', 'stumbles', 'least', 'what', 'stated', 'lead', 'paragraph', 'once', 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'room', 'evil', 'peeling', 'back', 'layers', 'Enslin', 'life', 'darkest', 'tragedies', 'what', 'point', 'can', 'viewer', 'believe', 'what', 'seeing', 'crux', 'good', 'ghost', 'story', 'maintaining', 'level', 'interest', 'viewer', 'Things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'are', 'only', 'scary', 'so', 'long', '1408', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'M-I-N-D', 'events', 'alter', 'one', 'life', 'events', 'inspire', 'despair', 'longing', 'instead', 'enforcing', 'hope', 'humanity', 'Cusack', 'performance', 'film', 'higher', 'typical', 'spook', 'tale', 'personally', 'always', 'matter', 'taste', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'story', 'be', 'fitting', 'counterpoint', 'good', 'entry', 'rarely', 'effectively', 'explored', 'sub-genre', 'ghost', 'story', 'point', 'film', 'worth', 'viewing']",1408

There's an effectively suspenseful intro into room 1408 with Samuel L Jackson giving stern warnings about entering that room.  Apparently, anyone who enters that room commits suicide, even if they're only there a few minutes.When Mike Enslin (John Cusack) actually does enter the room, the movie picks up steam...turning into a kind of Ghost Hunters t.v. show on crack.However, although there's a creepy vibe and your typical scare tactics, it seemed like this story was going to take a more meaningful turn.  The ghosts and demons that visit Mike are actually ghosts and demons from his painful past.  I even shed a tear, which is an unexpected response for a thriller.  So instead of being like a Ghost Hunters episode, it seemed like it'd be more like a Twilight Zone episode, with a meaningful plot twist at the end.I thought perhaps there'd be a message about letting go of your past or about resisting the temptation to escape, either by drinking or committing suicide.

Yeah, that is my own innner child screaming for some innate understanding of the particulars of a movie, as opposed to blanket generalities, and for a lax reviewer I suppose that is a bias. Well so be it. The only saving grace in the movie was when Cusack, who is bland, detached and feverishly boring, orders a double Patron chilled. High fives on the couch abounded after that remark.Samuel L. Jackson. Tsk, tsk, tsk. How painful to watch him in anything. If he ever did anything good, it was because the people that he was sharing the screen with had the talent. He just shined off them. Go ahead and think about it. If his performances in the Star Wars films wasn't enough to send him a check to personally have him never to appear on the big screen again, we have this ersatz for talent appearing as a hotel manager, who is not in the least disturbingly scary. One would think, save wooden and pretentiously arrogant in most roles, he would have made the viewer all the more wary of having Cusak's character actually enter 1408. I mean there is this huge set up now about not entering the room, that charge that a REALLY REALLY good director, like well ya know, DePalma, Kubrick, Demme, would have made tres important, so that myself, and perhaps others, could really get the hairs on our arms doing backflips in anticipation of the horrors that await.

656528,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00005JPSE,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","NOTE: This review contains MAJOR SPOILERSA specific hotel room in the Dolphin Hotel, New York, has become a breeding ground for disaster. In Room 1408, people have killed either themselves or other people through the ages, for no apparent reason whatsoever. The staff has since abandoned not only the room, but the entire floor as well (the thirteenth). Nobody is allowed on the thirteenth floor unless someone is supposed to be, such as maids or janitors. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a skeptic writer who specializes on paranormal activities, and he wants to know if 1408 really is a hellhole or if the murders are powered by false superstition. The manager of the hotel (Jackson) warns him about the dangers of staying in Room 1408 for about one hour, but Enslin doesn't budge. As soon as he finds himself in Room 1408, bad things happen, of course. And this is when his own beliefs on the paranormal are drastically challenged.This is one of the more effective (and intelligent) horror films that I've recently seen. When other horror films rely on blood, gore, and whiny teenage girls, ""1408"" relies more on atmosphere and psychological effects. There are a few jump scares here and there, but they're actually done pretty well. This also has a more mature tone: this is the kind of horror film that is suited more for adults than for teenagers and kids. I'm sure several teenagers enjoy this, too, but I do think that this movie is primarily for adults. The one problem I had with the movie was when Enslin is convinced that his stay at the hotel was only a dream. This scene is situated very late in the film, right before he realizes that he is still in the hotel, and it's somewhat annoying, considering that the ""dream sequence"" is an old and tired gimmick that we've seen many times before. I know that we as the viewer are supposed to believe that it's not a dream at all, but it's done far too well as it looks and feels a bit too predictable. This is my only gripe, however, as everything else in the movie works.Now, I want to talk about the ending to this movie. The alternate ending (the one that's on the DVD) has been fairly criticized for its more depressing outcome. I think the criticisms are unjust, because I feel that this ending is far superior to the original theatrical ending. I have seen both endings, and, in my opinion, the alternate is more effective compared to the theatrical. I don't want it to be conventional. I don't like it when these particular horror films have a typical happy ending, where all the problems are solved with a feel-good attitude. With this alternate ending, it challenges you by going against your emotions and making you think of the consequences that you have just seen on the screen. Also, to me, this ending fits more to the entire movie. Enslin sacrificing himself to prevent his estranged wife from being 1408's next victim shows that he really changed. In the past, he has made some selfish decisions before his daughter's death. Even though he does lose his life in the end, he realizes that he has one last chance to redeem himself, and he accepts it despite a few consequences.Overall, this is one of the better horror films to have come out in the year 2007, and I even think that it surpasses some other horror films in the present. Keep in mind, this is not as excellent as The Exorcist or The Shining, but it's pretty close.Grade: A-",5,One of the more effective horror films to have been released in the new millennium,1276041600,"06 9, 2010",2010,3401,"['NOTE', 'review', 'MAJOR', 'SPOILERSA', 'specific', 'hotel', 'room', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'New', 'York', 'become', 'breeding', 'ground', 'disaster', 'Room', '1408', 'people', 'have', 'killed', 'other', 'people', 'ages', 'apparent', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'staff', 'abandoned', 'not', 'only', 'room', 'entire', 'floor', 'as', 'well', 'thirteenth', 'Nobody', 'allowed', 'thirteenth', 'floor', 'someone', 'supposed', 'be', 'such', 'maids', 'janitors', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'Cusack', 'skeptic', 'writer', 'who', 'paranormal', 'activities', 'know', '1408', 'really', 'hellhole', 'murders', 'are', 'powered', 'false', 'superstition', 'manager', 'hotel', 'Jackson', 'dangers', 'staying', 'Room', '1408', 'one', 'hour', 'Enslin', ""n't"", 'budge', 'As', 'soon', 'Room', '1408', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'course', 'when', 'own', 'beliefs', 'paranormal', 'are', 'drastically', 'challenged.This', 'one', 'more', 'effective', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'recently', 'seen', 'When', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'rely', 'blood', 'gore', 'whiny', 'teenage', 'girls', '1408', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'psychological', 'effects', 'are', 'few', 'jump', 'scares', 'here', 'there', ""'re"", 'actually', 'done', 'pretty', 'well', 'also', 'more', 'mature', 'tone', 'kind', 'horror', 'film', 'suited', 'more', 'adults', 'teenagers', 'kids', ""'m"", 'sure', 'several', 'teenagers', 'enjoy', 'too', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'primarily', 'adults', 'one', 'problem', 'had', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'Enslin', 'convinced', 'stay', 'hotel', 'was', 'only', 'dream', 'scene', 'situated', 'very', 'late', 'film', 'right', 'still', 'hotel', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'considering', 'dream', 'sequence', 'old', 'tired', 'gimmick', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'know', 'viewer', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'not', 'dream', 'done', 'far', 'too', 'well', 'bit', 'too', 'predictable', 'only', 'gripe', 'however', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'works.Now', 'want', 'talk', 'ending', 'movie', 'alternate', 'ending', 'one', 'DVD', 'been', 'fairly', 'criticized', 'more', 'depressing', 'outcome', 'think', 'criticisms', 'are', 'unjust', 'feel', 'ending', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'theatrical', 'ending', 'have', 'seen', 'endings', 'opinion', 'alternate', 'more', 'effective', 'compared', 'theatrical', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'conventional', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'particular', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'problems', 'are', 'solved', 'feel-good', 'attitude', 'alternate', 'ending', 'going', 'emotions', 'making', 'think', 'consequences', 'have', 'just', 'seen', 'screen', 'Also', 'ending', 'more', 'entire', 'movie', 'Enslin', 'sacrificing', 'prevent', 'estranged', 'wife', 'being', '1408', 'next', 'victim', 'really', 'changed', 'past', 'made', 'selfish', 'decisions', 'daughter', 'death', 'Even', 'lose', 'life', 'end', 'one', 'last', 'chance', 'redeem', 'few', 'consequences.Overall', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'films', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'year', '2007', 'even', 'think', 'other', 'horror', 'films', 'present', 'Keep', 'mind', 'not', 'as', 'excellent', 'Exorcist', 'Shining', 'pretty', 'close.Grade', 'A-']",1408

No, its a series of little moments that become compelling and you can feel the inner turmoil of Cusack as he descends deeper into despair. There is a moment with his daughter that is so real and played so beautifully by the actors and the director that is was heartbreaking. I know most people dont watch horror films for that but it shocked me and how much I felt for the characters.

Now that might not sound very remarkable, but I'm someone who almost _never_ finds films scary.  For me to get into that state over a film, it has to resonate with me in a way that few films can.Of course, I'm a sucker for horror in general, especially haunted house flicks--probably my favorite horror subgenre.  I'm a big fan of Stephen King (down to liking the majority of King-related films), a big Samuel L. Jackson fan, and I like John Cusack.  It was an excellent idea to have Cusack's character, Mike Enslin, be a jaded skeptic.  I could empathize with him, because I'm also a writer and a skeptic with an interest in horror-related topics and the supernatural.  I thought the unusual move of setting this in a major, working New York hotel was well thought-out.  I also love the atmosphere of the hotel--the interior decoration, the design of the sets, etc.All of the above primed me for the film, combined with some fine scriptwriting and performances--for example, the extended scene featuring Jackson's character, Gerald Olin, pleading with and trying every way to bribe Enslin into rethinking his decision to stay in Room 1408 was one of the better I've seen in some time.The scariest moments arrive fairly early--shortly after Enslin begins his stay in 1408, but the whole film is incredibly engrossing, even if it begins to turn into more of a ""rubber reality"" trip by the end--ala Jacob's Ladder (1990), Memento (2000), The I Inside (2003), and maybe not just coincidentally, the too-little-known Nightmare on the 13th Floor (1990) (different than the Thirteenth Floor from 1999, even though that's another rubber reality film) . . . and that's another favorite genre for me.

Samuel Jackson wasn't convincing as the hotel manager in spite of his two words of French, and he gets more billing than he deserves as he must occupy about 15 minutes worth of movie time.  Cusack wasn't bad.  The chill factor is akin to the kind of drug paranoia associated with people who went off the deep end with LSD or some other such substance and never 'made it back' (Syd Barret?).  Sixties child S. King's work has often been influenced by the psychedelic potential, which offers interesting possibilities for his novels and more so when left to the imagination rather than the screen.  There are some decent visual moments in the film, but there are just as many others that simply feel like gaudy Hollywood manipulation.  The premise of stepping into this room is that you are stepping into another dimension simutaneously - a dimension which doesn't follow the laws of logic or time, is bent on tormenting those who enter, and from which there is no escape, as it is hardly of this world in the first place.  Charming, eh?The film doesn't really compare with Kubrick's Shining.  Yes, they were both Stephan King, yes they both take place in hotels.  But where The Shining is a masterful work of art on all levels (story, acting, cinematography), 1408 is a kind of fast food by comparison, with a quick story, so-so character acting and more special effects than dynamite film work.  It does leave a mark though as do so many of King's stories, tapping into a kind of primal paranoia.  I give this film 3.5 stars, and maybe it deserved 4, but not 5.

656544,A34FEX6IPQL95G,B00005JPSE,"Greg C. Unleashed ""cinemaguys.com""","[4, 6]","Over the years Steven King has written some impressive books, with the protagonist being a writer. In his novels/films we have some examples of the following that illustrate this theme: The Shinning (1982), Misery (1993), and Secret Window (2005).Director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m was nominated for an Oscar in Best Foreign Language Film in 2004, but most recently, he directed the American action thriller Derailed (2005). Now he is back with 1408, based on a Steven King's short story. We are going off the record to tell you horror fans that this is the best movie this year for this genre, not just because of the theme it presents--a psychological drama mixed with a ghost story--but of the performance of our leading actor John Cusack and supporting actor Samuel Jackson.Story:Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a non-fictional writer of the supernatural books. They involve the most popular haunted places throughout the United States and so he travels to disprove these occurrences. After staying at a so-called haunted Inn--where there are no ghosts--he leaves the next morning to pick up his mail and finds a post card. The card has a warning that tells him not to enter room 1408 at the Dolphin hotel in NYC. However, he accepts this as a challenge even though--once arriving there--the manager (Jackson) pleads with him and tells him that room has a history of evil involving 56 deaths and that no one has lasted more than an hour. Enslin does not seemed to be concerned by this and believes that the manager is just giving him a lot of supernatural hype--to get people to stay at his hotel.In a short while and after his talk with him he ventures up to his room, he unlocks the door, and to his surprise, the room looks very normal. When the clock radio starts playing by itself and begins the one hour countdown, he is surprised and frightened by this occurrence. Will he survive the haunting of room 1408?Review:Our director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m, does a outstanding job of bringing to the big screen an old school theme of and horror and anxiety in which the viewer will get the impression that they are watching an old episode of the Twilight Zone or Outer limits. Because just like those vintage shows, our director focuses more on the acting and photography, rather than special effects that we have grown accustomed over recent years with this supernatural genre--like Thirteen Ghosts (2001) and White Noise (2005).The photography is efficient throughout the duration of the film from the filters--8 mm visual appearance of the ghosts--to close-ups of Cusack showing his mental and physical appearance--goes from cool and calm to insane--and what works the best is that the photography gives us a very surrealistic manifestation of his environment. Most of the story takes place in this hotel room.The ""Oscar worthy"" acting is what sells 1408 because of the range of emotions that we watch our main character experience. In the beginning of the film, he is cool, calm, as if a reporter would be covering a news story. However, as the film progresses we watch him turn from reality to uncertainty of his very existence as the room changes before his eyes, in which the effects give us a very theatrical style and very reminiscent of the Twilight Zone. What was also refreshing is the performance from Jackson. He portrays a very calm and sophisticated character rather than a loud mouth--of what we are accustomed to in so many of his acting roles.You might be disappointed in the story not because they keep you guessing, but they do not fully explain his (Cusack) personal problems and this leaves you wondering how he looses his faith in his profession of being a non-fictional ghost writer.The Verdict:This is excellent supernatural horror movie that will keep you guessing to the end.

In both cases, the movies' writers try to cram a maximum number of head fakes into as short amount of time as possible. The two films also put forth the very implausible idea that if you manipulate a person's mind enough, and mentally break him, that somehow that's going to heal him, or at least begin the process of healing.  Count me as skeptical on that one.The two movies do differ on the source of their protagonists' psychological and physical torture.  While The Game tries to make a non-supernatural case for psychotic manipulation, 1408 just presents the supernatural as fact.  In 1408, causes and motives for the supernatural events are irrelevant, with the minor implication, as presented by Samuel L. Jackson in a refrigerator of all places, that the people who stay in the inhospitable room are somehow guilty of bringing their doom upon themselves.The DVD provides alternative endings to the movie release.

After a couple devastating losses, he makes a living trying to debunk hauntings all across the country and writing his cynical views and selling them. And, apparently, makes good money off his skepticism. So, after getting an invitation to try out a hotel with one single warning, he ignores the warning and goes to the one forbidden room in the entire hotel. Room 1408. What makes it forbidden? Everyone who's ever checked in had died after going completely insane. Impossible. At least, in Mike's eyes, it is. When he first checks in, he makes fun of all the stereotypes behind famous hoaxes and cliches (and is rather funny doing so). But, in next to no time at all, gets psychologically attacked all over by the deranging room in every way possible. Things that defy every form of physics he's ever known that's trying to push him over the edge (and sometimes, it's a wonder if he actually he does go over). In a very strange way, Mike seems to go through his own version of Dante's Inferno.What makes Mike's character unique is John Cusack. 'Nuff said. A very versatile actor that can pull off many different types of people. And, in this film's case, pull of a huge emotional range and have a unique transition from full-on skeptic with bulldog tenacity to losing his edge and be one second away from pulling his hair out in total frustration and confusion. Plus, some of the looks he pulls off is pretty creepy, giving his arc of insanity that much more a realistic grit. Samuel Jackson, on the other hand, is pretty straightforward, which is good for mysterious character, the owner of the Dolphin Hotel.

He actually stays in the room expecting it to be not that bad since he has stayed at haunted places in the past. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the motel manager eventhough he's short and white in the short story I think but while reading it, I pictured Samuel L. Jackson anyway. Samuel L. Jackson adds more humor and sarcasm to the part though. Anyway he's both creepy and funny in the small part as he practically begs Cusack not to stay in 1408 adding some hilarious Samuel L. Jackson style curse words. Soon after arriving in 1408 Cusack realizes that 1408 is the real deal and as much as he'd like to leave the room won't let him.The ghosts in 1408 can look like prejections from the Haunted House in Disney World, so they aren't that scary. But there's still pleanty of moments in the movie that will make you jump. The movie is also very entertaining but mostly due to the great work from John Cusack. He can make you laugh pleanty of times but the movie can also have it's emotional scenes which he handles fine as well. I admit there's a scene at the end where he had me close to tears. Despite some scares, the movie really wouldn't have been as good without him.Even if you read the story, there's no one else you can picture who's as perfect for the part.

656569,AQD2LYCJIJOH5,B00005JPSE,Jman,"[0, 0]","For those who don't know, this movie was based off a short story of the same name written by Stephen King back in 1999. The story itself is about a skeptical writer Mike Enslin (played by John Cusack), who travels the country trying to debunk ghost stories by visiting haunted houses and anything purported to be haunted. In the movie he is bitter and atheistic after the untimely death of his young daughter from some type of cancer. Then one day as he is sorting through his mail he comes across an anonymous postcard featuring the fictional 'Dolphin Hotel' built in 1912 (1910 in the book) and on the back of the postcard it's written &#34;Don't enter 1408&#34;. Mike Enslin takes this as a challenge and tries to get access to room 1408 but finds that the hotel manager has forbidden anyone from entering the room because of all the people who have died in that room (56 in all). Mike uses an old civil rights law to bypass the hotel's rules and manages to get inside room 1408. It isn't long before things start to get very surreal and very insane. And the worst part is the room won't let Mike escape.The room isn't haunted, rather the room itself is encompassed by some malevolent supernatural entity that manages to get inside the minds of the people who go into the room and ultimately causes them to commit suicide. Whether this entity is a demon or something else entirely is never made clear. What also doesn't make sense is the origin of the entity which is never explained. For example, how is a single room that's not even on ground level just happened to randomly be possessed upon its completion. It's just that specific room in the hotel that's the problem, not the hotel itself. And since the room is 13 stories up (not on ground level), it's not as if there was anything that happened in that particular space where it was built.

It uses supernatural (was that a ghost?) and psychological (is it all in my head?) elements to create an effective horror atmosphere. There's suspense, creepiness, and many jump scares spread throughout the film, along with a few great twists in the plot. The setting is also fantastic, as mentioned in the film, hotel rooms are naturally creepy; room 1408, however, is a special case as it changes constantly - the weather conditions, particularly, change often. Basically, the film works great as a psychological and a supernatural horror film. The music is also magnificent. The acting was also great. The pace is moderate during the first 30 minutes, then it goes into a very fast pace.Overall, 1408 is an exceptional horror film that masterfully executes its supernatural/psychological blend, packing a creepy and constantly changing setting and a lot of scares.

This is yet another poltergeist horror film, but with psychological suspense rooted in the protagonist's own personal grief.  So it feels real even while it isn't.  A ghost or spirit, in classical literature may be more accurately imagined as a shade or shadow of the person which once was.  While I don't thrive on spooky stories, this one fixed my attention on the screen, palms sweating in supense.  The protagonist is a self professed atheist who's lost his daughter (and his marriage) to a childhood disease.As a Christian, I'll hazard to venture upon extra  Biblical traditions, and notice that some American native cultures include traditions of the spirit of the deceased remaining for a prescribed time among family and friends.  But untimely death may cause a spirit to linger aimlessly.  To the Christian perspective, the parent and child in this story are lost (wanderers), but not aimlessly.  In some ways, the purity of her ghost is what causes this story to transcend the boundary lines of pointless living or pointless death.Christian scripture omits any instance of a God who pounces upon human souls, demanding, &#34;what did you do with my son?&#34;  What one does in life is, rather, the foundation or essence of what one's life becomes, in present and future time events.

Not the type who can change their appearances so well, like Uma Thurman and Daniel Day-Lewis. He is an actor who can change is character, demeanor, and presentation with each and every part he plays, and do it to perfection. A lot of other so-called actors should take a few lessons from him, namely Seth Rogan, who plays Seth Rogan in everything he does, and George Clooney, who playes George Clooney in everything he does. The list is virtually endless. John NEVER plays John, and his acting role in 1408 is no exception.You've seen and heard all about 1408 from countless reviews and allusions over the years since its release, so I won't bore you with the details. What I will bore you with, however, is the poignant fact that if you have yet to see this movie...you MUST check it out. And here's why: IT IS A RARE MOVIE! That's why.""How?"" you ask.Well...it isn't often that we get to see a generally creepy horror film. Gore doesn't mean horror, people. Blood and guts is NOT horror. Screaming girls with their mounds of cleavage bouncing from here to Mars while they run from the guy in the mask is NOT horror...not TRUE horror, anyway. Axe- and knife-wielding mad-men do not a horror film make.Genuine horror can be witnessed by the greats, one of whom I will mention now...Alfred Hitchhock. Horror is suspense. Horror is the ""wondering"" if something is around that next dark corner. Horror is the thrill of FEAR of the unknown. Horror is the anxiety associated with anticipation. Horror is all that adrenalin that runs through your body without an ounce of physical activity put towards its activation. And on this level, 1408 delivers. It is atmospheric, strange, bizarre, and generally rewatchable...just for the sake of there being nothing else out there quite like it. 1408 comes recommended from my family and my friends as well. I have yet to meet a person who didn't find this movie tense and, yet, quite enjoyable.The Blu-Ray transfer is very good but not perfect. There are times when John is in the darkness of 1408 that colors seem to blend, leaving soft edges and no clear definition of said edges. The black levels are adequate, but sometimes the presentation was tainted with a greenish or yellowish hue, this I believe, was purposeful however. Overall it was a above-average BD transfer.1408 is a diamond in the rough of the plethora of mediocre to miserable so-called horror films out there. It is dark, creepy, and definitely one to watch if you want your girl to squeeze a little closer to you when the lights are out! :)One note: The theatrical ending (much preferred) is not included on the Blu-Ray disc for some reason. Instead, it is the Director's Cut, which isn't alluded to anywhere on the cover. Someone dropped the ball in this respect. Maybe some day in the near future, they will release a double disc BD with more extras and the proper treatment as far theatrical endings and director's cuts go.

656583,A3OH101U0CPUC7,B00005JPSE,Joseph Boone,"[2, 3]","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a travel writer who specializes in haunted locations.  When he discovers the Dolphin Hotel has a room responsible for numerous fatalities he can't resist the challenge of spending the night.  The hotel manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson) tries to talk him out of it, literally begs him to forego the night's stay but Enslin won't hear of it.  Enslin may write about the paranormal, but he doesn't actually believe in it.  Needless to say, room 1408 will change all of that.  Things start slow and then get progressively nasty as the room torments him relentlessly.John Cusack gives an excellent performance as burned out Mike Enslin.  As we learn more about his past involving the death of his child and his failed marriage, Cusack does a great job of conveying the emotions of his shattered character.  Samuel Jackson is also strong as Olin.  He's strong, poised, and believable as an upscale hotel manager.  The two actors also work well onscreen together.  In some ways, the highlight of the movie is early on when they go head-to-head in Olin's office.Like any good horror movie, things start off slow and then the tension starts to build.  There are plenty of creepy happenings, some ""gotcha"" jump moments, and the underlying story is more than interesting.  The ending is fairly inventive and satisfying.Those interested in the original short story by Stephen King that inspired this movie can find it inEverything's Eventual : 14 Dark Tales.  The movie is similar up to a point but goes in its own direction for most of the second half.My criteria for a horror film are simple.  If I feel plenty of tension from the suspense of what will happen next and it doesn't completely gross me out with gore, then it's a winner.  In this case, the tension is definitely there, the gore is almost nonexistent, and the characters are far more compelling than we normally see in horror movies.",5,Lucky 13,1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1916,"['Mike', 'Enslin', 'John', 'Cusack', 'travel', 'writer', 'who', 'haunted', 'locations', 'When', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'room', 'responsible', 'numerous', 'fatalities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'challenge', 'spending', 'night', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Mr.', 'Olin', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'talk', 'literally', 'forego', 'night', 'stay', 'Enslin', 'wo', ""n't"", 'hear', 'Enslin', 'may', 'write', 'paranormal', ""n't"", 'actually', 'believe', 'Needless', 'say', 'room', '1408', 'will', 'change', 'Things', 'start', 'slow', 'then', 'get', 'progressively', 'nasty', 'room', 'relentlessly.John', 'Cusack', 'excellent', 'performance', 'burned', 'out', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'learn', 'more', 'past', 'involving', 'death', 'child', 'failed', 'marriage', 'Cusack', 'great', 'job', 'conveying', 'emotions', 'shattered', 'character', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'also', 'strong', 'Olin', 'strong', 'poised', 'believable', 'upscale', 'hotel', 'manager', 'two', 'actors', 'also', 'work', 'well', 'onscreen', 'together', 'ways', 'highlight', 'movie', 'early', 'when', 'go', 'head-to-head', 'Olin', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'things', 'start', 'slow', 'then', 'tension', 'build', 'are', 'plenty', 'creepy', 'happenings', 'gotcha', 'jump', 'moments', 'underlying', 'story', 'more', 'interesting', 'ending', 'fairly', 'inventive', 'satisfying.Those', 'interested', 'original', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', 'inspired', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'inEverything', 'Eventual', '14', 'Dark', 'Tales', 'movie', 'similar', 'up', 'point', 'own', 'direction', 'most', 'second', 'half.My', 'criteria', 'horror', 'film', 'are', 'simple', 'feel', 'plenty', 'tension', 'suspense', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', ""n't"", 'completely', 'gross', 'out', 'gore', 'then', 'winner', 'case', 'tension', 'definitely', 'there', 'gore', 'almost', 'nonexistent', 'characters', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'compelling', 'normally', 'see', 'horror', 'movies']",1408

Ridgway ""Ridge""","[0, 1]","Imagine being in a creepy room that you can't escape from and it's scaring you because it's touching deep psychological nerves of fear.  Then you wake up and you think that it was a dream, but then you find out that you're waking up really was the dream and you are still in the room. And it goes on and on .... This is one of the most psychologically disturbing parts of this film ... the idea of being trapped in a nightmare unable to escape an unbearable situation.  (Remember the TV series from the '60s, The Prisoner?  Touched a similar nerve, but much less so.)Then you start seeing your Daughter, who died of cancer, and she's telling you ""Daddy, I'm scared, I'm cold ...... ""  indicating of course that your little daughter is facing the cold, lonely, malevolent ""afterworld"" without the comfort of you, her Mother, any Angels or benevolent deities.  Once again, it deeply touches the ""disturbing"" nerve.  And you can see your wife over a screen but she has no idea where you are or that you're in danger.  And it just gets more & more unbearable until you are tempted to end it all.OK, that's the basic idea of this movie.  Lots of psychological horror in lieu of outright violence and gore.  I think that it deserves an R rating because of that (as well as Hollywood starting to drop F-bombs in supposed PG-13 movies -- if they're going to do that, they should accept an R rating).I had the same opinion of the Ring.  IF you follow along with it, then you get to a point where you are despairing and feeling lost, with the Nihilistic message.  But at least there is redemption in the end in ""1408"" (in the version that we watched!  I hear there's another ending out there that's much more depressing.)  Some hard-core horror fans may not find the movie compelling, but I did, because I generally do not watch the hard-core stuff and so I'm not so calloused yet.Actually the ""room"" is a metaphor for life's seemingly inescapable traps, such as massive depression or drug addiction.  That the main character gets out of it in the end, could be inspiration to someone going through a real-life ""Room 1408.""I liked the acting job of John Cusack, who carried most of the movie as the originally cynical ghost hunter who gets trapped in the room/nightmare and tries to get out.  Also, Samuel Jackson makes the most of his supporting role, as a forceful & charismatic Hotel Manager.  You never know if he's on Cusack's side, or he's part of the conspiracy to trap people in that bleeping room!BTW I give this movie 3.5 stars but since Amazon doesn't have half-points, I'd rather round it up to a ""4"" than down to a ""3.""",4,"Psychological Horror Film Largely Works, Deserves an R Rating",1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,2622,"['Imagine', 'being', 'creepy', 'room', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'scaring', 'touching', 'deep', 'psychological', 'nerves', 'fear', 'Then', 'wake', 'up', 'think', 'was', 'dream', 'then', 'find', 'out', ""'re"", 'waking', 'up', 'really', 'was', 'dream', 'are', 'still', 'room', 'one', 'most', 'psychologically', 'disturbing', 'parts', 'film', 'idea', 'being', 'trapped', 'nightmare', 'unable', 'escape', 'unbearable', 'situation', 'Remember', 'TV', 'series', ""'60s"", 'Prisoner', 'Touched', 'similar', 'nerve', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'Then', 'start', 'seeing', 'Daughter', 'who', 'died', 'cancer', 'telling', 'Daddy', ""'m"", 'scared', ""'m"", 'cold', 'indicating', 'course', 'little', 'daughter', 'facing', 'cold', 'lonely', 'malevolent', 'afterworld', 'comfort', 'Mother', 'Angels', 'benevolent', 'deities', 'Once', 'again', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'nerve', 'can', 'see', 'wife', 'screen', 'idea', 'where', 'are', ""'re"", 'danger', 'just', 'more', 'more', 'unbearable', 'are', 'tempted', 'end', 'all.OK', 'basic', 'idea', 'movie', 'Lots', 'psychological', 'horror', 'lieu', 'outright', 'violence', 'gore', 'think', 'R', 'rating', 'as', 'well', 'Hollywood', 'starting', 'drop', 'F-bombs', 'supposed', 'PG-13', 'movies', ""'re"", 'going', 'do', 'should', 'accept', 'R', 'rating', 'had', 'same', 'opinion', 'Ring', 'IF', 'follow', 'along', 'then', 'get', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'despairing', 'feeling', 'lost', 'Nihilistic', 'message', 'least', 'redemption', 'end', '1408', 'version', 'watched', 'hear', 'ending', 'out', 'there', 'much', 'more', 'depressing', 'hard-core', 'horror', 'fans', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'movie', 'compelling', 'did', 'generally', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'hard-core', 'stuff', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'so', 'calloused', 'yet.Actually', 'room', 'metaphor', 'life', 'seemingly', 'inescapable', 'traps', 'such', 'massive', 'depression', 'drug', 'addiction', 'main', 'character', 'end', 'could', 'be', 'inspiration', 'someone', 'going', 'real-life', 'Room', '1408', 'liked', 'acting', 'job', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'carried', 'most', 'movie', 'originally', 'cynical', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'who', 'trapped', 'room/nightmare', 'tries', 'get', 'out', 'Also', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'most', 'supporting', 'role', 'forceful', 'charismatic', 'Hotel', 'Manager', 'never', 'know', 'Cusack', 'side', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'trap', 'people', 'bleeping', 'room', 'BTW', 'give', 'movie', '3.5', 'stars', 'Amazon', ""n't"", 'have', 'half-points', ""'d"", 'rather', 'round', 'up', '4', 'down', '3']",1408

I like ""thriller,"" but in last 25+ years most horror films have been ""slasher"" - blood, guts, and gore - instead of good, honest, edge of your seat psychological thriller.  1408, however, successfully returns the thriller genre to the big screen.1408 pulls you in quickly and keeps on going.  The pacing is just right.  The intensity of this film is excellently timed, bringing you to your edge of your seat, and then releasing you.  This rollercoaster effect actually increases the ""thrill"" of the thriller; you do not get numb and disconnected from constant slashing and bashing, fright and horror.The performances are terrific.  John Cusak is great as always. Samuel Jackson is riveting and appropriately spooky.  The little girl, Jasmine Jessica Anthony, is extremely talented.  The rest of the supporting cast does a similarly nice job.As I said, there is very blood, guts, and gore in this film; it is a true thriller.  It is the LACK of said blood, guts, and gore that gives this film its psychological edge, and prevents it from becoming a slash `em up film.I recommend this film.

656586,A3FY3H6F4249E0,B00005JPSE,Kathy W,"[4, 5]","I was really pleased to see this genuinely scary flick WITHOUT all the blood and guts and slashing and killing.  I am sooo sick of all that shock-value trash!  I want suspense.  I want to hear my heart thump because I don't know what's gonna happen next, and this is it!  This was a well done horror flick.  I watched it right before bedtime, so I had to have a little pep talk with myself before I went to sleep.John Cusack is outstanding in his role as Mike Enslin, a cynical hardened writer of mainly books that challenge ""haunted"" hotels.  Mike stays in the ""haunted"" room for the night, but never sees any ghosts.  Then he comes back and debunks the so-called haunted hotel.  Mike is a hardened soul who really doesn't seem to believe in anything, nor really care about anything since the death of his young daughter and the subsequent break up of his marriage.  You get the impression that his books aren't very good either.  He seems to have just kind of dried up inside.Anyway, Mike meets his match when he arrives at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, to stay at the alledged haunted room 1408.  Prior to his arrival, the Dolphin will not even accept a reservation from him for that room.  Upon his arrival and insistance, he is greeted by Samuel L. Jackson, the hotel manager.  Mr. Jackson tries everything to persuade Mike NOT to stay in 1408.  He even tells him the room is just ""fxxxxxx"" evil, but cannot convince cynical Mike. He shows him black and white photos of some bloody dead people (which is as gory as it gets) from that room and tells him about many many deaths associated with the room, but Mike thinks it's just a snow job and insists on staying.  By the way, Samuel Jackson adds just the right amount of creepyness to his part.So, Mike is led to his room and the manager departs his company at the elevator.  Things begin to happen very soon after Mike gets this attitude that nothing is going to happen.  First a window comes down and cracks open Mikes hand, and the clock mysteriously resets itself on a 60 minute countdown while it starts playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" by the Carpenters'.  A little at a time, all heck begins to break loose.  I can't tell you anymore without ruining the movie for you, but if you want a good scare, this should do it.  It's full of surprises and real heart-thumping terror.  When it's finally over you say, ""Whew!"" and are glad you're alive.No, I do NOT recommend it for children. Let them have their sweet childhood dreams as long as they can. By the way, I am pleased to say that I don't remember any foul language in the movie other than the comment by the hotel manager (above) for emphasis.

I'm not sure what it is about him as an actor that holds my attention but after seeing him in a wide range of films, I find his versatiliy, his ability to play a broad spectrum of characters and to keep  pushing the envelope and explore new territory to be intriguing. Don't get me wrong - I don't have a crush on him. He's an actor. I'm a reviewer - don't know the guy.Now, ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I read the short story in King's collection and have to say that the movie takes lots of creative liberties but that's fine by me. It holds true to the essence of the story. I happen to like this in book form better but that is because it's taut and doesn't waste words. Besides, it is easier to linger on a certain passage, until it is seared into the imagination.Still, the movie has its fine points as well. As mentioned before, there is John Cusack, who definitely comes across as a skeptical writer who becomes genuinely spooked by his experiences in Room 1408. His acting is as interesting as usual, pulling out all the stops, with those quirky facial movements that can suggest so much about a character without saying a word.I found the special effects to be less impressive and the movie seemed to go on forever. But that's my main problem with adaptations of King books to screen. Sometimes they work beautifully and other times they fall flat.

656588,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B00005JPSE,K. Driscoll,"[17, 21]","1408's theatrical cut is just below mediocre but the director's cut is a solid four stars out of five and one of the most effective horror films in the last five to ten years.  So I went with three stars to balance things.  It is amazing that such little changes can have such a dramatic effect on one viewer's perception.  It's a shame that the Weinstein's decided to flub 1408 and give it a sappy and clich&eacute; Hollywood ending rather than the dark and gutsy horror ending that Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m decided to create.  This is the version that you folks in Europe and South American got to see in the theaters.  The director's cut certainly seems to be the real cut, as 1408 seems to move along at its own pace within that version.  It is simply a film about a man who checks into a hotel and we enjoy the suspense build up as the film's main protagonist soldiers forth.  Hfstr&ouml;m clearly knows what he's doing and he is influenced by a bevy of horror's most keenly detailed films, and that is why it is such a shame that his punches are pulled by Dimension Films for the US audience.  His razors are dulled, his poison is given an antidote, and his biggest attack of all is completely de-clawed.  Shame on the Weinsteins and shame on the US audience that always has a hankering for these sappy moments of comforting resolve.  Other than that I have no strong feelings on the matter.The Weinsteins did do one good thing and that is to suggest the casting of the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Mr. Gerald Olin.  He probably should've been played by some little old white guy with a fancy accent, but instead we get the absolutely iconic Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson is surely one of my favorite actors and it is simply because I enjoy watching him in anything he is in, and 1408 is no exception.  Jackson is like Jack Nicholson, he can play anything but it seems that creeping perpetually underneath every character he plays is a little bit of Sam winking at the audience as if to say ""it's me again"".  Olin is the formulaic old man who warns the kids not to go into that house or stay at that camp, and no one listens.  The problem is Jackson, as an icon, is traditionally such a great intimadator, but here he is the intimidated and yet he carries the same confidence in 1408 that he carries anywhere else.  He warns ghost skeptic and author Mike Enslin, played by the equally enjoyable John Cusack (if you don't believe me I recommend seeingGrace Is Gone) that his quest to find physical or visual validation of the supernatural will end in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, but it will very likely mean the end of Enslin's life as well.  1408 is an extremely evil room.  It would have to be if not even Jackson will go inside.The screenplay is great and it is based on a Stephen Kingshort storyI'm only familiar with by name.  Themusicin this film is outstanding and works the suspense triggers with the pace perfectly.  Enslin is a loner, who the audience will either like or dislike, but his character is very strong and Cusack plays him as if the audience could take him or leave him as a viable hero.

John Cusack does a credible job as the protagonist Mike Enslin, a cynical writer of non-fiction books who visits allegedly spooky places to debunk their claims of ghostly specters.  Against the advice of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin visits a supposedly haunted room in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, insisting on staying in Room 1408, the locus of many a tragic event.  He finds that painful memories flood his mind as he descends progressively into the grip of the hotel's malevolent power.  The special effects are spooky and just short of over the top.Some viewers may criticize the film's lack of realism, most notably the ability of anyone other than a rock star or royalty to get a hotel room this large in New York City.  More likely you get a room so small that you have to step outside just to change your mind.  But what can you expect for a mere $617.00 a night in Gotham, the City that Never Sleeps?Or talk about scary -- $12 for a 4-oz. tin of honey roasted peanuts in the Honor Bar?

When I heard that the movie would basically have one setting, room 1408, I was a bit disappointed at first.. I kept thinking how could they make an entire movie with this one ""scary room?"" Boy, was I wrong. This movie has everything a horror movie fanatic would love; it's creepy, it plays on the psychological effect (is he going crazy or is it just the room), its emotional. And just when you think it has ended, and he has finally died, it continues but does not drag on. The movie was so good my palms and feet were sweating (haha).The only thing that I wish they included was what the room looked like when he finally left. Was everything that happened all in his mind, or did all those horrible things really happen? *SPOILER ALERT* his wife is called and when he tells her to call the police and come to the room she tells them that she did, and there was no body in it. Was that just apart of him going crazy or did that happen?

656598,AXVEAO9T82XR1,B00005JPSE,Lance,"[0, 0]","So, I did the dumb thing and read the short story just before watching the movie, so take that into account when reading this review.The movie itself was watchable, if a little disjointed and somewhat hard to follow, but saying that it's based on Kings story is more of a cruel joke than an accurate description.Two characters in the book made it into the movie, but since they were the only two chacters in the book (the writer and the hotel manager), it would have been impossible to leave them out.  Apart from that, I counted 3 vague references to the book.  3.The film makers added several chacters, presumably for us to hate.  The ex-wife made me want to punch her in the face within 2 minutes of being on screen.  When your ex calls you, obviously freaking out and tells you to call the police and save his life, you don't start whining about how he didn't call you when he got into town.  She was begging to be hated, which seems to be the only reason she was in the movie - because trying to build a background for the writer failed miserably.Then starts this whole thing where the room tries to convince him he seeing his dead daughter, and he starts to lose it.  again, adding characters to the story that weren't needed.I'm just disgusted with this movie.  The book made the room a truely malevolent entity.  The movie made it a kinda creepy and surreal place to be, it was so watered down if I didn't know it was based on the book I never would have recognised it.  The stupid film didn't even get the pictures on the wall right!!!!Things that really pissed me off because it wasn't supposed to happen: He left the room (at least he thought he did), he interacted with other people while in the room, he was able to contact people outside the room, he crawled around the freakinig vents and found a dusty corpse that of course (in crappy, predictable movie fashion) came to life and chased him through the ducts, the list could go on for as long as the movie, which seemed endless.Honestly, it was such a struggle to watch the last half hour, I didn't think I would get through it, but I had to see how much more the film makers could screw up the story - and on that point they take the cake, all of the cake, even the crumbs.Then the writer dies at the end, which wasn't supposed to happen, and the story was much more disturbing knowing that for the rest of his life he had to sleep with the lights on so when he woke from his nightmares he instantly knew he was not in that room any more.John Cusack delivers an amazing performance, and is really the reason to watch this movie, the only reason.  He is believable, genuine, and with all the other things I hated about this film, I still found him compelling.Sam Jackson was good as well, but his character was poorly written and in no way resembled a hotel manager.Conclusion:  Skip the movie and read the story.

656603,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B00005JPSE,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[2, 3]","When 1408 was first released into theaters, I had heard mixed reviews, not from critics, but from friends of mine who had managed to catch screenings of it before I did. Not that that was hard to do, mind you, because I rarely, if ever, went to see films in the theaters. I think in recent years the only film I was going to see in theaters was 30 Days of Night, but was unable to due to a stint in the hospital. Going back to the mixed reviews, a friend of mine, who was also a big fan of horror movies, told me it was awful, not worth the money, and like an idiot I listened to her.However, for some reason that I can not explain, when the film was released on DVD, I had this strange compulsion to watch it. I noticed it was On Demand one day, and I called my mom up and asked her what she thought of the movie (her and my father had seen it at the drive in). She said that she thought it was 'ok'. However, with all due respect to my mom, every film in her eyes except The Dark Knight is 'ok', and it's even harder for a horror film to please her. Against the odds, I rented the film and watched it. However, the On Demand version was the directors cut, but I still loved it.Well, you can imagine my surprise when I watched the theatrical version and the original ending came along. The things that really stuck out about this, though, was John Cusack's performance. It was incredible. I had never really been a fan of him before this- he had never really done horror films, and I tend to watch pretty much only horror. But he blew me away with this. The direction was strong, Samuel L was in it (which is always props to me), and it wasn't relying on blood and guts, like the Hostel or Saw franchises. I must admit it scared me that the film was rated PG-13, but for a PG-13 film, it got away with quite a few uses of the F word (when Cusack hurts his hand).As for this DVD... I love it, I love the postcards it came with, and the very, VERY short making of's, and the fact that it has both versions of the film, but... It's kind of disappointing. Why couldn't they put both versions of the film on disc one and LOAD the second disc with extras and making of's, kind of like the Batman Begins DVD did? If you're looking for behind the scenes footage, you'll find, oh, I'm guessing... ten minutes worth? It's a good ten minutes, but it could have been much, much more.Since I tend to read reviews on Amazon for information on the DVD extras and not the film itself, that is what is most crucial for me to reiterate in my review. This DVD is NOT a Collectors Edition, it is a 'spend more money for two versions of the film and ten minutes of behind the scenes!' But it's a cool ten minutes, and I guess even though I'm disappointed with the content, I say buy it if you love the movie. I mean, why not?

John Cusack stars as a man who specializes in debunking paranormal occurrences in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. It is fairly loyal to the original Stephen King short story and has two great actors, Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, but it doesn't quite work overall as a horror flick because some of the visuals hurt the movie (e.g. when we see the ghosts and other paranormal activity). There isn't much in the way of gore, violence or shocks so it works more as a psychological thriller. By all rights it starts out by building a decent amount of tension but it doesn't really pay off. It just does not come across because we don't feel emotionally involved in the film despite some good performances. Jackson isn't really in the movie enough to share billing with Cusack. Some scenes are downright dull despite having a fairly good premise and set-up. It is probably 15 minutes too long for its source material.

And then there arethe momentswhere he's way off the map in all directions.  It's no biggy, considering how prolific his career has been.""1408"" was a short story of his that was meant to be more of a creative exercise than anything else.  I've never thought King was much of a short story writer -- his imagination needs room to stretch; ""1408"" the story isn't so bad, but I remember wondering how on earth they planned to stretch it out to movie-length.  The writer in King's tale isn't in the deadly room for ten minutes before the story comes to a close.It's hard to tell how long Cusak's Mike Enslin ends up in the room.  An hour at least.  The hotel room's powers make it hard to trust one's perceptions.  In fact, the whole of its horror is all about twisted perceptions, and therein lies the flaws of ""1408.""Enslin is a hack writer (once talented and profound) who makes a living by exploiting areas that are supposedly haunted.  Due to a personal tragedy, Enslin is dead-set against belief in any kind of spirit world, making him both a hack and a hypocrite.  It isn't long after he's shut the door of ""1408"" behind him that his beliefs are tested by the room's weird, ambient horror.Well, it's not exactly horrific.  King comes up with scary images, but without any supporting substance, they're really nothing more than images.  Bleeding walls.  Paintings with changing pictures.  Menacing spirits that appear and disappear.  Sure, it's creepy, but what's there to it?  As far as ""1408"" is concerned, there's only one goal: to drive Mr. Enslin mad enough to end his own life.Cusak bears the lion's share of what makes the movie worth watching at all (Samuel Jackson is the other name of note, but all he does as far as this film is concerned is chew on both cigars and scenery).  Enslin's history with his wife and daughter, added for the film, make his experiences noteworthy, although not terribly frightening.  You want him to get out of the hotel, but the room's machinations are just a series of mental tricks.

The movie stars John Cusack as a paranormal horror author Mike Enslin. He writes books along the lines of ""10 Haunted Hotel Rooms"" and other haunted places. He doesn't believe in ghosts nor does he believe in God because of the death of his daughter. (""How could God allow my daughter to die"" kind of thing)Enslin receives a postcard warning him not to enter room 1408 of the Dolphin hotel in New York City. The hotel manager, Mr. Olin, played by Samuel L. Jackson gives him a long list of people who have died in that room. One maid was stuck in the bathroom for only a moment and had become blind. When asked about the spirits or ghosts of the room, Mr Olin tells Enslin, ""It's just evil.""Scary things happen near the beginning of Enslin's stay, I'll give it that. I was on the edge of my seat once he entered the room. He's given an hour to live. Olin warns him, ""No one has survived longer than an hour."" The clock beside the bed ticks off the seconds. Unfortunately, as the clock nears 00:00:00, I went from thinking, ""What in the world is this?!?"" to ""Just finish this trash already"".1408 had so much promise. It could have been a terrific horror movie if done properly. It could have been done in a way that scared the living daylights out of you, while giving you ideas to think about.

656614,APOUYO1BEPK22,B00005JPSE,"M. B Cole ""Kegrun""","[2, 2]","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a `true story' horror writer in the fact that he writes about haunted houses or places he visits. Never has he actually come across a ghost or even anything remotely haunting and it shows in his cynicism when people ask him questions or when people tell him about something that is haunted. One day while going through all the `come to my haunted place' mail he gets, he comes across a simple post card saying `Do Not Enter 1408', and it grabs his attention and he decides to try out the room. After some legal action, he finally gets his room booked and heads to the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel Jackson), tries his best to convince Mike to not go into the room and to just take a penthouse suite and go to a Knicks game... anything but go in there. After some very convincing arguments from Gerald, Mike still goes in the room. Once in the room, Mike begins to witness some strange and scary events from a room that isn't just haunted, but more like evil and demonic. Mike is convinced he's just drugged from liquor that Gerald gave him and is hallucinating everything until things begin to hurt him.I really didn't care for this movie for the fact that, due to the trailers, I thought I was going to be watching a scary haunted room movie. But in fact it was more of a scary psychological thriller movie. That doesn't really bother me, but most of the scenes were just plain or not that interesting. There were a couple scenes that were really good, but there were just too many that made me wish the movie was over. I for one could have done without the daughter scenes, but that's only because I didn't know I was going into a `thinker' movie. Sure, I get the point that the room was bringing out his inner demons or whatever, but at the time, it was just out of place for me. And then the whole `is he in the room or is this in his head' and `did he escape or did he not' stuff was just not well thought out. If you wanted to leave it open for us for thinking, I don't think the ending should have been what it was. I heard there were two different ending though and I saw the one that was on the single disc DVD.I'll tell you what though; Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor. While he was trying to convince Mike to not go in that room, I was thinking, ""DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM. LISTEN TO SAM! HE GOT ATE BY A SHARK! HE KNOWS THINGS!"" The dialogue between John and Sam was really done well by both actors. I shouldn't really have to say much about John Cusack, he's awesome in everything he does. It's just his style that I really like. Like when Sam was hovering over John in a chair while telling a story, you see John look up and say ""What are you doing?"" It just felt like it wasn't scripted to me and I started giggling a little.Well in the end, I would say give it a try. These movies are seriously hit or miss for all different types of people. But to this guy, I really hated it both times I saw it.P.S. - My room was haunted when I was growing up!

656617,A19L7AXZWAWO95,B00005JPSE,"Mehdi J. Pieloor ""Movie Geek and Book Guzzler""","[3, 4]","As with a lot of Stephen King ""movies of the week"", 1408 has - for the avid Regular King Reader(TM) - ups and downs. So let me put the review in a similar dual way.First, as a movie all of itself, 1408 works. It's a Haunted Mansion/Closed Door story where the character (who, of course, doesn't believe in ghoulies, ghosties and beasties) finds himself trapped inside a hotel room that is supposed to be haunted; after a couple of minutes of paranoia (the hotel needs some advertising and people play the haunting ploy by remaking his bed and rehanging the toilet paper, that's all there is to it. Or, hey, maybe the glass of cognac was laced!), the main character, Michael Enslin, begins to realize that there is something wrong, there, after all. As the story progresses, the room becomes more and more violent, using Mike's own ghosts of the past to drive him crazy (a nice little backstory that is a little clich&eacute;, and the similarly standard ""who's haunted: the man or the house"". The Shining, anyone?).The movie works towards a climax that is, in the original, a standard PG-13 ending, and, in the Director's cut, a more ambiguous (and, god-forbid, sequel-begging). The faux escape scene is haunting on its own (and vaguely resembles a ""The Prisoner"" premise). All in all, all by itself, this movie rates about 3 stars, both for the original which is closer to the short story, and the director's cut.Now, for the Regular Readers(tm)...1408 is a short story in the collection ""Everything's Eventual"", that has the following premise: a writer (who carries some disappointment in both his original writing career and anything that's supposed to be haunted) enters a hotel that has a room that's - supposed to be - haunted. After an uneffective chat with the hotel manager he goes into the room and finds that it is not necessarily *haunted*, but there's something really, really wrong.The story draws on Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the room is portrayed as a gateway to the other side, where the Old Ones reside. The character doesn't really have a backstory for the room to prey on, but with Cthulhu, that's not necessary.And THIS is where the movie - for a Regular King Reader(tm), anyway - fails. The movie doesn't use the genuinely creepy Cthulhu Mythos premise, but turns the story in a Stanley Kubrick The Shining makeover, where the main character himself already carries some ghosts with him. All in all, there's a very Hollywood good vs. evil thing going on (and I've seen reviews where the room is called ""Hell"" - come on, people, does everything have to have that God vs. Devil thing to be creepy, these days? And then there's the fact that Mike denounced God because of his daughter dying: (quote) ""And then we find out that there really is no God to protect us from anything, is there?"".), where the main character either survives (""good wins"", theatrical version - Mike finds God again) or doesn't (""evil prevails, but still sort of loses"", director's cut, Mike still denies God exists).The written story works on a much better level, because there's no ""good"" (God) or ""evil"" (Devil), just the Old Ones with their own undefinable purposes who maybe don't win, but they sure as hell don't let go of Mr. Enslin. If he didn't have any ghosts at the start of the story, he sure as heck does at the end.From this point of view, the story gets one star, no more. Together with the three stars above, that evens out to a ""meh"" two stars.As with many Stephen King movies, there's some ambivalence regarding story integrity and the ""what works for a movie audience"" factor. The story's original premise has been altered (&aacute; la Kubrick's ""The Shining""), but the acting is solid (and almost reaches the level of ""Misery"" and ""Cujo"").",2,Not quite it: A Stephen King Regular Reader point of view,1194134400,"11 4, 2007",2007,3757,"['lot', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'week', '1408', 'avid', 'Regular', 'King', 'Reader', 'TM', 'ups', 'downs', 'So', 'let', 'put', 'review', 'similar', 'dual', 'way.First', 'movie', '1408', 'works', 'Haunted', 'Mansion/Closed', 'Door', 'story', 'where', 'character', 'who', 'course', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghoulies', 'ghosties', 'beasties', 'trapped', 'hotel', 'room', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'couple', 'minutes', 'paranoia', 'hotel', 'advertising', 'people', 'play', 'haunting', 'ploy', 'remaking', 'bed', 'rehanging', 'toilet', 'paper', 'hey', 'maybe', 'glass', 'cognac', 'was', 'laced', 'main', 'character', 'Michael', 'Enslin', 'realize', 'something', 'wrong', 'story', 'room', 'more', 'more', 'violent', 'using', 'Mike', 'own', 'ghosts', 'past', 'drive', 'crazy', 'nice', 'little', 'backstory', 'little', 'clich', 'eacute', 'similarly', 'standard', 'who', 'haunted', 'man', 'house', 'Shining', 'anyone', '.The', 'movie', 'climax', 'original', 'standard', 'PG-13', 'ending', 'Director', 'cut', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'god-forbid', 'sequel-begging', 'faux', 'escape', 'scene', 'haunting', 'own', 'vaguely', 'Prisoner', 'premise', 'movie', 'rates', '3', 'stars', 'original', 'closer', 'short', 'story', 'director', 'cut.Now', 'Regular', 'Readers', 'tm', '1408', 'short', 'story', 'collection', 'Everything', 'Eventual', 'following', 'premise', 'writer', 'who', 'disappointment', 'original', 'writing', 'career', 'anything', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'hotel', 'room', 'supposed', 'be', 'haunted', 'uneffective', 'chat', 'hotel', 'manager', 'room', 'not', 'necessarily', '*haunted*', 'something', 'really', 'really', 'wrong.The', 'story', 'draws', 'Lovecraft', 'Cthulhu', 'Mythos', 'room', 'portrayed', 'gateway', 'other', 'side', 'where', 'Old', 'Ones', 'reside', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'backstory', 'room', 'prey', 'Cthulhu', 'not', 'necessary.And', 'THIS', 'where', 'movie', 'Regular', 'King', 'Reader', 'tm', 'anyway', 'fails', 'movie', ""n't"", 'use', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'Cthulhu', 'Mythos', 'premise', 'story', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'makeover', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'already', 'ghosts', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'thing', 'going', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'reviews', 'where', 'room', 'called', 'Hell', 'come', 'people', 'everything', 'have', 'have', 'God', 'vs.', 'Devil', 'thing', 'be', 'creepy', 'days', 'then', 'fact', 'Mike', 'denounced', 'God', 'daughter', 'dying', 'quote', 'then', 'find', 'out', 'really', 'God', 'protect', 'anything', 'there', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'survives', 'good', 'wins', 'theatrical', 'version', 'Mike', 'God', 'again', ""n't"", 'evil', 'still', 'sort', 'loses', 'director', 'cut', 'Mike', 'still', 'God', '.The', 'written', 'story', 'works', 'much', 'better', 'level', 'good', 'God', 'evil', 'Devil', 'just', 'Old', 'Ones', 'own', 'undefinable', 'purposes', 'who', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'win', 'sure', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'Mr.', 'Enslin', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'ghosts', 'start', 'story', 'sure', 'heck', 'end.From', 'point', 'view', 'story', 'one', 'star', 'more', 'Together', 'three', 'stars', 'out', 'meh', 'two', 'stars.As', 'many', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'ambivalence', 'regarding', 'story', 'integrity', 'what', 'movie', 'audience', 'factor', 'story', 'original', 'premise', 'been', 'altered', 'aacute', 'Kubrick', 'Shining', 'acting', 'solid', 'almost', 'level', 'Misery', 'Cujo']",1408

So I was really looking forward to it when it came out on DVD.  And I ended up putting off watching it immediately.I think part of the reason was that I really wanted to like it.  Stephen King, when he's on (and I think he will be in the upcoming DUMA KEY), can't be beaten in the creep-factor.  And John Cusack is just one of those actors that I can watch no matter what he's in (though my personal fave is GROSS POINTE BLANK).Having them together was just a little bit of heaven.  In a hellish, possessed hotel room sort of way.  With Samuel L. Jackson playing a hotel manager who might not exactly be on the side of the angels.Happily, I enjoyed the movie, got my quota of scary moments and John Cusack intensity/one-liner presentations.There's nothing really new here.  King has pulled off bigger scare fests that still manage to touch the heart.  And Cusack has certainly performed in roles with more and deeper range.  But they definitely landed in fair territory (to use a baseball euphemism that King will appreciate) with this one.  You get more runs through base hits than with homeruns.  People just remember the homeruns more.Cusack, likeable as always with a touch of the sardonic and sarcastic, portrays Mike Enslin, a writer of true horror who doesn't believe in the paranormal.  Despite his lack of beliefs, his books have done well enough to give him a decent life.  However, he's never gotten over losing his young daughter, Katie, to a terminal illness or his own loss of faith.  He puts God and ghosts on the same page and filed them all in the circular bin.Until he reaches Room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  A mysterious postcard arrives and sets Enslin on the trail of the long line of deaths associated with the hotel room.  Even though he doesn't want to be, Enslin is captivated by the idea of the room.  He decides he needs to stay there for the night for the final chapter in his latest book.The atmospheric build-up leading to Enslin's checking in at the Dolphin is so much a part of this story.  We can see that he's driven and missing a piece of himself, but we don't know what's driving him or what he's missing.  Then, as he researches all the deaths, I got hooked on the story.I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good ghost story.  I love digging into the background of the coming tale, trying to guess what the writer is going to attempt to do to me during my stay.  I hadn't read King's short story in the collection EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL, or if I had, it forgot it.  The screenwriter's outdid themselves on this one.  An overview of the short story shows that much of what they created for the movie wasn't in the short story, but the whole atmosphere was.  That's what King excels at when he's got his A-game.After Cusack checks into the room, during the last hour of the film or so, 1408 almost becomes a one-man play.  Cusack carried the whole load of the movie on his shoulders and totally walked through it like he was out for a Sunday stroll.  Cusack nailed every emotion, his own as well as the ones he was trying to elicit from the audience.  He played me like a harp, and I've seen enough horror films and read enough Stephen King to stay one step ahead.  And I did, but the movie kept me constantly on the move to earn my one step.The special effects are awesome, but they only work so well because of Cusack's performance and the pacing by the director, Mikael Hafstrom.  If the human element and the timing hadn't been there, it wouldn't have mattered how good the special effects were.  Audiences believe in character and atmosphere before they believe in cinematics.As it turned out, because of the holidays, I ended up watching the movie one night, then again the next.  It held me captivated both nights, just watching Cusack go through his paces again as I picked up small nuances of the visual cues that I'd missed or neglected to pay as much attention to because I was pumping adrenaline the first time.The only thing I can fault the movie for was not explaining why Room 1408 was haunted.  There's enough of a history there that I bought into the overall story, but usually movies and tales like these always nail down the ""origin"" story as well.  This one didn't and I was irritated enough to mention it.  Still, no matter what explanation had been provided, I might have discounted the threat if I'd known what the horror was actually caused by.If you're a horror fan, there's a lot to like about 1408.  And if you want to sit down with the older kids on family night for a little chill and shiver, this movie is definitely one you can do that with because there's no obscenely bad language and the death scenes didn't push it past a PG-13 rating.

Enslin, embittered by the death of his little girl, boasts that in none of his investigations did he have any ghostly encounters...until he decides to stay overnight in Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel where over 50 people met mysterious deaths.  Creepy hotel manager Samuel L Jackson warns Enslin that no one lasts more than an hour in the room and he almost refuses to let him stay, but Enslin persists and his night of terror begins.  The movie has some good jolts, and although it's script is sometimes muddled and the ending a little anticlimactic, 1408 is a good ghost story and Cusack dominates it with his performance.

656623,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JPSE,Michael Crane,"[16, 21]","It is extremely refreshing to finally see a ""true"" horror movie that doesn't go for shock value.  All of the horror movies that come out now only deal with a lot of blood, guts and torturing.  Not knocking that type of movies, but it gets tiring when it's the same thing over and over again.  With ""1408,"" you are given a truly creepy movie that gets into your head, as well as in your soul.  The premise at a glance seems simple and even risks being overly ridiculous if not handled with the greatest of care.Mike Enslin is a writer who likes to take his accounts of so-called ""haunted"" areas and sell them to the public in his books, however if you really know the man you know that he really doesn't believe in anything.  Still, there is something that drives him to go to each place that claims to be haunted to see if he can have some sort of proof that there is something more to what we simply see everyday.  He gets a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel and on the back it warns him specifically not to go into Room 1408.  Of course, this makes Mike all the more curious, so he sets his sight onto the room.  Not even the manager of the hotel can steer him away with his warnings, as Mike himself says to the manager that he doesn't believe in ghosts or monsters, and even if they did exist that there was no God to protect them from such horrors.  The manager allows Mike to stay in the room after seeing there is no way to tell him otherwise.  What Mike will witness during his stay is the things that nightmares are made of, and it will dish out every single fear he has ever had along with forcing him to revisit a horrible personal tragedy and get to the very bottom of his soul.""1408"" not only is a well-made horror movie, but it's also an excellent film over all.  This is a movie that goes to places that a lot of the new horror movies don't go.  The movie is not afraid to get personal and deep while still giving you great scares.  There are times that you may find yourself jumping here and there, but the scare factor is mostly psychological and it'll make you feel uncomfortable in your seat.  You don't have to scream aloud to be frightened.  It's a scream that you keep inside of yourself and take with you when you go to bed, and it lingers in your head no matter how many times you try to shake it off.There are two things that make this movie a success; 1) John Cusack is phenomenal, and dare I say this might be one of his best performances ever, and that is nothing easy considering the fact that he's solo in 90% of the movie.  He has great range as an actor, and this movie showcases all of his emotions and you really feel for him and grow to love him.  2) The emotional human side of the film that's very realistic.  Even though it's been said in reviews and the trailer, I don't want to give it away.  You'll understand when you watch the movie.  These are the two important factors that make the movie work and keep it from being a ""goofy horror"" flick.The 2-Disc ""Collector's Edition"" contains some behind the scenes features, both the theatrical and an ""Extended Director's Cut"" and commentary on the ""Director's Cut"" version of the film.  I've seen both and I personally prefer the theatrical cut, but it was interesting to see the other version.  In fact, the director, as much as he loves some of the extended scenes and the ""alternate ending"" that's featured in the ""Director's Cut,"" admits to being very happy with the theatrical version and understanding why some things were better left out or changed (this found on the commentary track with him and the writers).  The ending in the other version is very different from the theatrical, but again I have to say I prefer the version I originally saw the first time.  If you go with the 2-Disc edition, you can view for yourself and see which one you like better.""1408"" is one of the few new horror movies that really made an impact on me, and it's a trip worth taking.  It's not one that everyone will like, and some people may not be able to handle some of the dark and depressing themes that the movie ventures into, but if you're sick of the torture flicks and want to see a genuinely creepy movie that'll stay with you, then I highly recommend checking it out.  Definitely goes down as one of my favorite movies of the year. -Michael Crane",5,"""She had taken a pair of scissors and gouged her eyes out.

656628,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JPSE,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","Based on Stephen King's short horror story, ""1408"" keeps us guessing whether the horror lives in the room or in the mind of its aggrieved, alcoholic protagonist. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a novelist whose creative energies have seen better days. Now he churns out guidebooks to purportedly haunted locales and tours the country in search of paranormal activity that he never finds. Mike wants to investigate Room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. But the hotel's manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) does everything he can to dissuade Mike from entering the room, where 56 guests have died in the hotel's 95-year history. Mike scoffs at the claim that no one lasts more than an hour, and insists on spending the night in Room 1408.We spend that hour with Mike in real time. The build-up to the hour of horrors introduces us to Mike's state of mind, to the legend of Room 1408, and to the imposing, intriguing hotel manager Olin. Mike's conversation with Olin is a lot of fun before we enter the maelstrom. The action in the Room runs out of steam after a while, but it recovers and succeeds largely because we're never quite sure what the source of Mike's ordeal is. At times, I thought ""1408"" was no more than a minor reworking of ""The Shining"", but the film doesn't linger long on any one rationalization. I can't say that I was scared, but I was entertained by Mike's cynicism, Olin's frankness, and that Room that forces its occupants to confront -and perish by- their own demons.The DVD (Weinstein Company single disc 2007): The single disc DVD contains the theatrical release version of the film, not the director's cut. Bonus features are 2 ""webisodes"", which are brief promo spots, and a theatrical trailer. In ""John Cusack on 1408: A Webisode"" (2  min), Cusack talks a little about the story and Samuel L. Jackson talks about the room. ""Inside Room 1408: A Webisode"" (2 min) features actors commenting on the room, and the special effects supervisor explains some of the effects. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.

Whoever the little girl actress is--she also did a remarkable job.The ending rocks (I promise I won't spoil anything).What makes this movie a little stronger than most horror fare is this:1. The pacing is great. Things never go over the top by being too intense for too long. This has been a big issue in horror films lately. They lose their suspension of disbelief from too much emotional weight. I don't know about you, but I find myself mentally withdrawing from such stories to come up for air. When I re-engage, much is lost.2. Speaking of suspension of disbelief wreckers...there is very little gore here. In this movie, when gore does come, it usually comes in the old photos. I feel this lack of abundant gore strengthens the pyschological impact of the movie as a whole. It also prevents the movie from turning plain old silly like recent gore-fests along the lines of The Hills Have Eyes.While this is not my favorite Stephen King adaptation--Shawshank still reigns there--1408 is a solid, intelligent and emotionally resonant movie. You will not be wasting your money if you go to see this over the 4th of July holiday.I give 1408 a strong recommendation.PS- This also gets the award for best use of a Carpenters song in a horror film since In the Mouth of Madness.",4,A Good Movie Made Stronger By Masterful Pacing...,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,1720,"['wife', 'went', 'see', '1408', 'other', 'night', 'was', 'birthday', 'gift', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'never', 'have', 'gone', 'horror', 'movies.Interestingly', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'movie.I', 'read', 'should', 'say', 'listened', 'short', 'story', 'prior', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Much', 'prefer', 'movie', 'version', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'prefer', 'movie', 'version', '1408.John', 'Cusak', 'great', 'usually', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Whoever', 'little', 'girl', 'actress', 'also', 'did', 'remarkable', 'job.The', 'ending', 'rocks', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'movie', 'little', 'stronger', 'most', 'horror', 'fare', 'this:1', 'pacing', 'great', 'Things', 'never', 'go', 'top', 'being', 'too', 'intense', 'too', 'long', 'been', 'big', 'issue', 'horror', 'films', 'lately', 'lose', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'weight', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'find', 'mentally', 'withdrawing', 'such', 'stories', 'come', 'up', 'air', 'When', 're-engage', 'much', 'lost.2', 'Speaking', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'wreckers', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'here', 'movie', 'when', 'gore', 'come', 'usually', 'old', 'photos', 'feel', 'lack', 'abundant', 'gore', 'pyschological', 'impact', 'movie', 'whole', 'also', 'movie', 'turning', 'plain', 'old', 'silly', 'recent', 'gore-fests', 'lines', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes.While', 'not', 'favorite', 'Stephen', 'King', 'adaptation', 'Shawshank', 'still', 'there', '1408', 'solid', 'intelligent', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'wasting', 'money', 'go', 'see', '4th', 'July', 'holiday.I', 'give', '1408', 'strong', 'recommendation.PS-', 'also', 'award', 'best', 'use', 'Carpenters', 'song', 'horror', 'film', 'Mouth', 'Madness']",1408

I'm happy that three of my favorite, recent horror films (1408, EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE and THE RING) have been PG-13.  They rely more on great writing than gore.  The two-disc DVD of 1408 had a second disc with the director's original ending, which was a bit of a downer.  I understood why it was reshot, as the ending shown in theaters framed the action with a bit more meaning and a bit less nihilism.  Anyway, I bought the blu-ray version for the better picture quality and the slimmer, space-saving package.  In checking the packaging, it looked like the blu-ray was pretty much the same as the two-disc DVD.  WRONG!  THE BLU-RAY HAS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT ENDING!  Nowhere on the package is this indicated.  Granted, the ending seen in theaters is available in the special features as an isolated scene... but I don't want that.  I want what the package implies: the theatrical cut in the blu-ray format.

656658,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B00005JPSE,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[1, 1]","Firstly, MINOR SPOILER ALERT AT END OF THIS REVIEW! Ok,I loved this movie, and am surprised that it didn't do better at the box office; I had never even heard of it until I saw it on Amazon. With Stephen King movies, you pay your money and you take a gamble (I remember all these years later, sitting in the theatre and watching CUJO, Hmm, somebody owed a pretty hefty downpayment on the newest house). But 1408 earns its' five star rating, and, having the double disc with both endings included, I have watched both versions a couple of times, and I intend to watch it again, soon. The plot is discussed in the many other reviews listed, and so I am going to pretty much stick to my personal view of the acting, for the most part - obviously, the writing, direction and production can be flawless, but if the acting isn't up to par, it's a complete waste of time, effort and money. John Cusack really surprised me with his portrayal of a burned out, grieving writer, Mike Enslin, who churns out books about hauntings/ghosts/the paranormal not because he has any belief in them (he specializes in debunking such things, but there is an underlying and unspoken suggestion that he may have at one time believed, or hoped to find proof that he could believe), but because it pays the bills. After he receives a mysterious postcard telling him to check out Room 1408 of The Dolphin Hotel in NYC, Mike demands to be allowed to stay in 1408, despite the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) telling him that the room is not available. This is where the movie pretty much turns into a one man showcase for John Cusack, who gets his way, gets into the room, and then can't get out. Watching John change the character of Enslin from a bored, cold-as-ice-what-do-I-do-today-to-keep-from-driving-off-a-bridge individual whose only child has died to a man who realizes that the bizarre events going on inside that room simply have no explanation (trickery, him being drugged and delusional, etc.) is fascinating, and again, I can't figure out why this movie, and John's acting, didn't make more of a critical splash. Whether he's taken aback at the sudden appearance of pillow mints on the bed or watching a ghostly and long ago suicide victim cross the room and climb onto the open window's ledge, Cusack shows just the right amount of shock, then cracks in the shell, then near hysteria and back to the sudden, sickening recognition that he might not being getting out of there alive. The other actors and actresses in the film are pretty much relegated to glorified extras, all there to advance the plotline, but that acting as well is good, and Samuel L. Jackson, as the manager Gerald Olin, could have delivered his few scenes in too heavy a hand, and it would have come off more camp than frightening...instead, he hits the mark perfectly, and the viewer realizes that Olin is just as afraid of 1408 as he tells everybody else to be. I really, really enjoyed this film, although I strongly disliked the version with the alternate ending: whether it is because you end up liking Mike Enslin, and pulling for him to make it out and not only write a great book but see Life through renewed eyes (there's a few seconds' scene at the beginning of the movie where, when sorting through the mail that holds the 1408 postcard in the first place, Enslin receives a birthday card - Cusack does a wonderful little weary, ""So what?"" glance at the card and flips it away, saying more right there about what this character feels since his child died than had he spoken three pages of dialogue), I just didn't really want the film to end (SPOILER!) with the hotel room winning. If you want to see Mike not go down as yet another victim to that 'evil f@#!@#@ room', as Gerald Olin puts it, watch the version that was widely circulated. If you want to see how Room 1408 adds another notch to its doorpost, the director's cut is for you. And if you want to be just a little more cautious when traveling from now on, when you check into your next motel/hotel room, do some quick arithmitic of the room number. If it adds up to '13', well....",5,King Adaptations: This One Works,1286150400,"10 4, 2010",2010,4113,"['Firstly', 'MINOR', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'AT', 'END', 'OF', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'Ok', 'loved', 'movie', 'am', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'box', 'office', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'saw', 'Amazon', 'Stephen', 'King', 'movies', 'pay', 'money', 'take', 'gamble', 'remember', 'years', 'later', 'sitting', 'theatre', 'watching', 'CUJO', 'Hmm', 'somebody', 'owed', 'pretty', 'hefty', 'downpayment', 'newest', 'house', '1408', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'having', 'double', 'disc', 'endings', 'included', 'have', 'watched', 'versions', 'couple', 'times', 'intend', 'watch', 'again', 'soon', 'plot', 'discussed', 'many', 'other', 'reviews', 'listed', 'so', 'am', 'going', 'pretty', 'much', 'stick', 'personal', 'view', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'obviously', 'writing', 'direction', 'production', 'can', 'be', 'flawless', 'acting', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'effort', 'money', 'John', 'Cusack', 'really', 'surprised', 'portrayal', 'burned', 'out', 'grieving', 'writer', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'who', 'out', 'books', 'hauntings/ghosts/the', 'paranormal', 'not', 'belief', 'debunking', 'such', 'things', 'underlying', 'unspoken', 'suggestion', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'believed', 'hoped', 'find', 'proof', 'could', 'believe', 'bills', 'mysterious', 'postcard', 'telling', 'check', 'out', 'Room', '1408', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'NYC', 'Mike', 'be', 'allowed', 'stay', '1408', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'telling', 'room', 'not', 'available', 'where', 'movie', 'pretty', 'much', 'one', 'man', 'showcase', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'way', 'room', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'Watching', 'John', 'change', 'character', 'Enslin', 'bored', 'cold-as-ice-what-do-I-do-today-to-keep-from-driving-off-a-bridge', 'individual', 'only', 'child', 'died', 'man', 'who', 'bizarre', 'events', 'going', 'room', 'simply', 'have', 'explanation', 'trickery', 'being', 'drugged', 'delusional', 'etc', 'fascinating', 'again', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'movie', 'John', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'more', 'critical', 'splash', 'taken', 'aback', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'pillow', 'mints', 'bed', 'watching', 'ghostly', 'long', 'ago', 'suicide', 'victim', 'cross', 'room', 'climb', 'open', 'window', 'ledge', 'Cusack', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'shock', 'then', 'shell', 'then', 'hysteria', 'back', 'sudden', 'sickening', 'recognition', 'might', 'not', 'being', 'getting', 'alive', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'relegated', 'glorified', 'extras', 'there', 'advance', 'plotline', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'manager', 'Gerald', 'Olin', 'could', 'have', 'delivered', 'few', 'scenes', 'too', 'heavy', 'hand', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'camp', 'frightening', 'instead', 'mark', 'perfectly', 'viewer', 'Olin', 'just', 'afraid', '1408', 'everybody', 'else', 'be', 'really', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'strongly', 'disliked', 'version', 'alternate', 'ending', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'pulling', 'make', 'out', 'not', 'only', 'write', 'great', 'book', 'see', 'Life', 'renewed', 'eyes', 'few', 'seconds', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'when', 'sorting', 'mail', '1408', 'postcard', 'first', 'place', 'Enslin', 'birthday', 'card', 'Cusack', 'wonderful', 'little', 'weary', 'So', 'what', 'glance', 'card', 'away', 'saying', 'more', 'right', 'there', 'what', 'character', 'child', 'died', 'had', 'spoken', 'three', 'pages', 'dialogue', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'film', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'hotel', 'room', 'winning', 'want', 'see', 'Mike', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'yet', 'victim', ""'evil"", 'f', '@', '@', '@', 'room', 'Gerald', 'Olin', 'watch', 'version', 'was', 'widely', 'circulated', 'want', 'see', 'how', 'Room', '1408', 'notch', 'doorpost', 'director', 'cut', 'want', 'be', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'cautious', 'when', 'traveling', 'now', 'when', 'check', 'next', 'motel/hotel', 'room', 'do', 'quick', 'arithmitic', 'room', 'number', 'up', ""'13"", 'well']",1408

656660,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B00005JPSE,Robert Badgley,"[1, 1]","1408(released in June/07) stars John Cusack & Samuel Jackson in this film based on a Stephen King short story released in /99.The film works well until shortly after we enter room 1408,then it starts to regress into a cliche ridden,been there done that,spook story.Author Mike Enslin(Cusack)is a moderately successful writer who has written a few books on ghosts and apparitions.He visits hotels,motels and houses that are supposedly haunted,well equipped with the latest in technology so he can document everything he experiences.However Mike is so far a skeptic,as he has never experienced anything approaching the paranormal in his travels.He returns to his home in California and goes surfing,only to experience a rather violent wave wash-over while trying to read a banner being pulled by a plane.Returning home he is sorting through his  mail when a postcard with the Dolphin Hotel in NYC,catches his eye.The writing on the back says NOT to visit room 1408 there.Intrigued he phones and tries to book it but has no success.He phones his publisher who in turn brings in a lawyer and between the three of them,they manage to get the room booked.He arrives at the Dolphin a few days later and is greeted by the hotel manager Mr.Olin(Jackson),who begs him not to stay in the room because it is evil.Mike will not be talked out of it and the manager personally escorts him up the elevator to the floor,but will not see him down the hall to the room itself.Mike enters the room to find a rather well appointed older style decor.Always with his personal tape recorder in hand,he talks his notes out,describing the surroundings as mundane and frustratingly waiting to put in another fruitless night.Slowly but surely things start to happen in increments,like chocolates appearing on his pillow,the toilet paper end arranged neatly and a painting going crooked.Suddenly the clock radio comes to life blaring out the Carpenters ""We've only just Begun"".When the room temperature rises to unbearable degrees,he calls a maintenance man who comes but won't step inside the door.After he hurriedly leaves and the door is shut the radio comes on again;he pulls it out but the time revs forward and stops at 60 minutes,only to start clocking slowly backwards.The game is on baby.Numerous specters of guests past,walk through the room,he tries to leave by walking out on the ledge to the next room but the next room disappears into never ending brick,he sees and talks to his dead daughter and father.We slowly find out that Mike carries alot of emotional baggage with the disintegration of his marriage because of his daughters death with cancer.Mike then desperately uses his laptop to contact his wife for help.This is cut short when the sprinklers go off.He tries to get out through the vent shafts above only to be chased back by an undead figure.A painting of a ship foundering in a storm comes to life and it floods the room with water.He goes under and resurfaces only to find himself back on that same beach in California that he was at when he was washed-over previously.He now can read the plane banner and the phone number on it ends with 1408.He ends up in the hospital with his wife by his side as he tries to make sense of what happened.She tells him to write about his experience,and when he does and is finished, he goes to the local post office to mail the transcript.However the employee who serves him tells him that he can't because they're closed.He recognizes him from the Dolphin Hotel and as he looks around at the construction crew,they are also from the hotel.They start into ripping the walls down to reveal room 1408 of the hotel.He has never left but re-enters it.The room now is blackened out from a fire.His daughter appears and there is a tearful reunion with her but she suddenly crumbles to dust as the clock radio comes back on and the room returns to normal.Mike grabs a cognac bottle given to him by Olin and makes a Molotov Cocktail out of it and sets the room on fire.The room erupts in screams as the flames engulf the entire room.Firefighters rescue Mike and he is taken to the hospital.Mike has escaped,but barely.As he sits at his desk at home listening to his burnt tape recorder with his wife,the voice of his deceased daughter comes on and both stare at each other in disbelief.Fade to black.The film builds wonderfully up until the moment the radio blasts out the Carpenter song.From there on in the movie becomes filled with cliches with the walking specters,the hot and cold room,the room filling with water,his disorientation,the taps scalding him,the walls issuing forth blood and so on and so on.The writers here went to great lengths to scare us but in the end,they just end up psyching themselves out by overcompensating with the special effects and muddying the haunted waters,by combining the occult with Mike's closet skeletons.Both main stars do wonderful jobs in their respective roles,with the film eventually turning into a one man show for Cusack;and he certainly was up for the task.It is just too bad the script wasn't.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include shorts on Inside room 1408,an interview with various stars on the film and the trailer.All in all a decent film of yet another Stephen King story,but expanded to lengths not necessary in order to scare.The film is strong up until shortly after he arrives in room 1408,then it goes downhill in plot and scare factor.It becomes a little too cliched and obvious with the main characters foibles thrown into the mix.But Cusack and Jackson are strong actors and they compensate for the films flaws as best as they can under the circumstances.",3,A film that psyches itself out!,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,5703,"['1408', 'released', 'June/07', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'film', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King',

I have grown bitter with horror films these days, but still hold on to hope at least once a year there will be one good one that comes out, which usually there is. 1408 is indeed, for me, this years one.It's not like it is without flaws, but the strengths in the film outweigh them. Cusack, for one, I think did just a great job with his role. Jackson was not in the movie too much so I guess he did fine with the little time he was on. The pacing and build up throughout the film I agree with the majority on, very well done. King always had a great way of building up suspense and he does not fail in this story either. He also does not fail to tug on the heartstrings as we eventually figure out why Enslin is the way he is- bitter, detached, etc.What I love most though is the lack of gore. I am not saying there should be none, but nowadays we are so incredibly filled to the brim with gore from so many other horror films, that watching one that really cuts back is just so refreshing. And also 1408 proves you do not need massive amounts of gore to have a movie creep you out. It's really a solid thriller throughout that at least kept me watching till the end.The only real problem I had in the film were the special effects. They were good enough, but I was expecting the effects to be a bit more impressive than they were. Also overall, after being a King fan for a long time, I have to admit 1408 does not measure up quite where many of King's other more heavyweight stories in the past did.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you.  Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, ""1408"" is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.John Cusack gives a tour-de-force performance as Mike Enslin, a successful writer who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity with a particular emphasis on hotel rooms that have the reputation for being haunted.  The twist is that Enslin is, essentially, a nonbeliever who spends most of his time and energy debunking the very subject off which he is making his living.  The 1408 of the title refers to a room in a swanky, five-star Manhattan hotel in which, we are told, no fewer than fifty-six guests checked in but never checked out, having met their untimely demises there in the decades since the establishment opened.  Determined to put an end to the ""foolishness,"" Enslin moves into the room convinced he will ride out the night in utter peace and safety.  He has, of course, another think coming.As adapted by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, ""1408"" succeeds mainly by keeping it straight and simple and by concentrating with laser-like focus on the character of Enslin and his relevant back story.  The multi-layered plotting keeps us guessing from first moment to last, so that we never quite know whether what Enslin is experiencing is really happening or whether he is suffering some form of mental breakdown brought on by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent breakup of his marriage a few years back.  Along with director Mikael Hafstrom, the master craftsmen responsible for the film's phenomenal art direction and sound recording draw us into the strange world they've created where nothing is quite what it appears to be and where we spend most of our time nervously scanning the edges of the frame to see what surprise is next poised to jump out at us.Cusack, who has long been underrated as a performer, gets the chance to really show us his acting chops in this role.  He allows us to clearly see the fear and vulnerability hidden beneath his character's wisecracking, cynical exterior.  Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack also excel in the small but pivotal roles of the wise hotel manager and Enslin's estranged but faithful wife, respectively.For those who can remember a time when fright films had more on their minds than simple gore and grue, ""1408"" is like a refreshing, restorative tonic on a hot summer day.",4,Top notch supernatural thriller,1183420800,"07 3, 2007",2007,2553,"['horror', 'movie', 'tastes', 'run', 'less', 'chainsaw-wielding', 'maniacs', 'more', 'towards', 'things-that-go-bump-in-the-night', 'then', 'movie', 'Based', 'short', 'story', 'great', 'Stephen', 'King', '1408', 'one', 'genuine', 'movie', 'sleepers', 'summer', '2007.John', 'Cusack', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'successful', 'writer', 'who', 'investigation', 'paranormal', 'activity', 'particular', 'emphasis', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'have', 'reputation', 'being', 'haunted', 'twist', 'Enslin', 'essentially', 'nonbeliever', 'who', 'most', 'time', 'energy', 'debunking', 'very', 'subject', 'making', 'living', '1408', 'title', 'refers', 'room', 'swanky', 'five-star', 'Manhattan', 'hotel', 'are', 'told', 'fewer', 'fifty-six', 'guests', 'checked', 'never', 'checked', 'out', 'having', 'met', 'untimely', 'demises', 'there', 'decades', 'establishment', 'opened', 'Determined', 'put', 'end', 'foolishness', 'Enslin', 'room', 'convinced', 'will', 'ride', 'out', 'night', 'utter', 'peace', 'safety', 'course', 'think', 'coming.As', 'adapted', 'Matt', 'Greenberg', 'Scott', 'Alexander', 'Larry', 'Karaszewski', '1408', 'mainly', 'keeping', 'straight', 'simple', 'concentrating', 'laser-like', 'focus', 'character', 'Enslin', 'relevant', 'back', 'story', 'multi-layered', 'plotting', 'keeps', 'guessing', 'first', 'moment', 'last', 'so', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'Enslin', 'experiencing', 'really', 'happening', 'suffering', 'form', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'brought', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'subsequent', 'breakup', 'marriage', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'director', 'Mikael', 'Hafstrom', 'master', 'craftsmen', 'responsible', 'film', 'phenomenal', 'art', 'direction', 'sound', 'recording', 'draw', 'strange', 'world', ""'ve"", 'created', 'where', 'nothing', 'quite', 'what', 'be', 'where', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'nervously', 'scanning', 'edges', 'frame', 'see', 'what', 'surprise', 'next', 'poised', 'jump', 'out', 'us.Cusack', 'who', 'long', 'been', 'underrated', 'performer', 'chance', 'really', 'show', 'acting', 'chops', 'role', 'clearly', 'see', 'fear', 'vulnerability', 'hidden', 'character', 'wisecracking', 'cynical', 'exterior', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Mary', 'McCormack', 'also', 'excel', 'small', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'wise', 'hotel', 'manager', 'Enslin', 'estranged', 'faithful', 'wife', 'respectively.For', 'who', 'can', 'remember', 'time', 'when', 'fright', 'films', 'had', 'more', 'minds', 'simple', 'gore', 'grue', '1408', 'refreshing', 'restorative', 'tonic', 'hot', 'summer', 'day']",1408

The Camera work is great work  also.Especially on second and third viewings.I watched the Directors cut first, especially since I had seen the thetarical release of the film first and was utterly blown away with the sound , the quality of film, and the things I had remembered.Having a 5.1 system at home, my system is closer to me than the theatre ( but not better than the theatre) so, I can get a loud effect, as well as a full sound effect.Its really mostly in the final third that the major changes are placed, but when seeing the film additional times, the first two thirds are so well crafted and well acted that when they stand up so well, its really a great statement about the film.The DVD is Well Packaged, and looks Great for the extra price.The 5 Cards you get are a great buzz, but did anyone get the ""Don't visit Room 1408"" Card ?

With several books under his belt, he's become numb to the supposedly haunted surroundings he puts himself into.  Until he hears about room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.  In order to check into room 1408, Mike must get his attorney involved, regarding some blue law that if the room requested is unoccupied it must be rented upon request.  It's the only way Mr. Olin (Samuel Jackson), manager of the Dolphin, will rent the room to Enslin.Enslin checks in, under the caution from Olin that no one has ever lasted longer than one hour in the room.  At first, its an ordinary room.  But then things start happening.  The clock radio continuously goes off on its own, playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" each time.  The room warps, the pictures come alive, ghosts appear, the door locks itself, the thermostat malfunctions, and visions from Enslin's horrible past with his wife and daughter begin to infiltrate reality.Cusack's performance is excellent, as is Samuel Jackson and Tony Sheloub (Enslin's attorney).  This is probably Cusack's best performance of his career, very believable.I read the short story before watching the movie and actually wished that I hadn't.  I believe the movie would have intrigued me better if I hadn't seen the changes made to the story in order to make it movie material.  The creeping madness of the story was lost on film.

656673,A2EZW8LU82S9KU,B00005JPSE,Scott Einig,"[15, 19]","To say the film ""1408"" is good is an understatment. To say it is one of the best horror films of the 2000s is more like it. Seriously, this film gets so many things right it blew my mind. I'm sitting in the theater, and I have an experience that I usually never get in a theater: I am creeped out of my wits. The film succeeds on neary every level: casting, direction, pace, production values (despite some corny CGI), acting, script, tone - everything about it is so well-done that any flaws can be easily overlooked.Mike Enslin is a writer who has thrown his considerable talent away for cheap non-fiction ghost tales that rarely get read. His newest book, ""Ten Nights in Ten Haunted Hotels,"" is near completion. He receives a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel with a single anonymous message written on the back:""Don't enter 1408.""Seeing this as a challenge, Enslin proceeds. After getting into a very entertaining argument over his right to stay in 1408 with the hotel manager, he finally gets in. Although he was previously told there's been over fifty deaths in the room, he's not phased. At least, until, his alarm clock erupts with the Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun."" And then we know we're in for one thrilling, amazingly entertaining ride.I must say, I'm like any film fan who believes the term ""horror film"" is frowned upon by society. All we've gotten are horrendously awful remakes of old classics and disgustingly sadistic torture/gore films. None of it is scary. It's just repulsive cinema. So imagine my surprise when I'm sitting there, watching ""1408,"" and I'm creeped out! Apart from that, it can actually be called a horror film. And it's rated PG-13, I might add. And it's creepier than anything I've seen for a long, long time. If anyone tells you good horror is strictly in R-rated territory, tell them to watch this.John Cusack is brilliant. Had he not been cast as Mike Enslin, this film would have been a disaster. Because, basically, he's in almost every frame of the film; when that happens, you'd better have a good lead actor to carry you through the story; any lesser actor woulkd have failed. Cusack more than meets the challenge. This film is proof he's a very underrated actor and deserves more recognition. There's so much in the story to work with that you can tell he had a blast doing the film.CAUTION: Spoilers hereVisually, the film comes through in spades. Room 1408 is anything but scary on first sight, just a normal hotel room. Then the room itself becomes a personal hell, driving poor Mike insane. This where the visuals take off; and some of them are wild! For example, Mike tries signaling for help across the street to another building. The man in the other building begins to wave frantically, as if he sees him. But suddenly, Mike realizes: the man is just a mirror image of himself. Also toward the end, we see a painting of a ship at sea, and all of a sudden, it comes to life, complete with waves and lightning.

Apparently writing about having seen no ghosts doesn't sell many books, either, which may explain why there are so many authors that apparently see them, and not many that don't.After the initial setup, which was very well paced, there is the (basically) one and only scene with Samuel L. Jackson, who must have been able to film all of his parts in a single day.  That's a shame, too, because he has a great deal of screen presence, and the parts he is in are very effective.Then begins the roller-coaster ride of scary things that go bump in the night.  This is done a *lot* better than I expected, and there is quite a bit of frenetic energy in this scare-a-thon.And then... the movie basically just ends.  It is almost like they weren't sure what to do, and just flipped the switch.  The final scene with his wife seemed tacked on.

656675,A23VDAM0WSVKHG,B00005JPSE,Shandra Shaw,"[0, 0]","The PG-13 rating given to 1408 belies this film's truly terrifying effects on its audience. Though it's far less gory than its peers, it has frightening moments and a creepy mood throughout. John Cusack (IDENTITY) plays Mike Enslin, a gifted writer who has turned his talents to paranormal travel books. His stays in haunted hotels never shake him, but he's intrigued by New York's Dolphin Hotel. Room 1408 has been the site of dozens of deaths, and this is a selling point for the skeptic in Mike. Despite the warnings of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson, BLACK SNAKE MOAN), Mike resolves to stay in the haunted room. No one has lasted more than an hour in 1408, and Mike has his work cut out for him. Though Cusack got his acting pedigree in comedies, he proves he's able to adeptly carry a horror film. He's in practically every frame of the film, often alone, and he's great at making the audience share in his fear. This is the second English-language film from director Mikael Hafstrom (DERAILED), and he does a good job of establishing tension. A lot of the credit is due to the film's sound crew, whose detailed work goes far in giving 1408 its unsettling feeling. Like THE SHINING, this is based on writing from horror master Stephen King, and it's a similarly creepy tale set in a hotel. But in its execution, 1408 is far more indebted to classic horror films such as the original 1963 version of THE HAUNTING. I was most skeptical but I found that I really enjoyed this film.

656676,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B00005JPSE,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[12, 27]","Having a sincere interest in paranormal investigation myself, I thought this movie would definitely be a thrill ride.  It set up a premise that was sure to be a hit.  John Cusack plays a popular author name Michael Einslin who writes books about haunted places but still doesn't believe in ghosts.  He checks into room 1408 (or does he?) at The Dolphin Hotel, where the manager (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him not to because of the horrible unexplained deaths and suicides that have happened in that room.  Let the chill bumps begin!The typical ""bumps in the night"" soon begin once he enters the room. The bed is mysteriously turned down and there's a chocolate on the pillow.  The clock radio comes on by itself with Karen Carpenter singing.  The thermostat won't turn down.  John's character treats us to narration as he records his thoughts on a tape recorder.  It all falls apart at this point.Michael panics when an open window slams shut on his hand.  A man in a window in an adjacent building mimics Michael's moves like a mirror and is then killed.  The key breaks off in the door when he tries to escape.  Ghosts that looked like something out of The Frighteners appear in the room and jump out the window.  Karen Carpenter starts playing again even with the clock radio unplugged.  Michael climbs out the window attempting to go to the window of the next room, but there is no window.  A crazy man keeps appearing and tries to attack him.  The pages of the Bible in the room go blank. By now, any paranormal investigation is off and things just get silly.A never ending bottle of cognac seems to fuel Michael's hallucinations, if he is hallucinating.  He climbs in the air vents to escape and looks down through the vents only to see snapshots from his past involving his wife, and his daughter who is dying, and a bumbling relationship with his father.  Some dead guy in the vent chases him back to the room, who looks oddly like Bill Murry's boss in Scrooged.  I found myself laughing at this whole charade rather than being scared.It rains in the rooms (sprinklers).  It snows (the thermostat is at -5).  And the boring paintings on the wall go mad.  Michael attempts to contact his estranged wife via his laptop.  Suddenly, it's all a bad dream and Michael is in the hospital, after having washed up on the beach from hitting his head on a surf board.  I myself was anxious for the dreary madness to be over too.One good part of the movie, in typical Stephen King fashion, is that Michael soon discovers that waking up in the hospital was just a dream too.  He's back in the room and going mad again.  Unfortunately, the viewer is only treated to tidbits of information about Michael's depression over his dead daughter, his sour marriage, and what's left of his crazy father.  You'll be just as confused as Michael is in this room.The best parts of the movie are merely blinks on the screen.  A mysterious girl at a book signing asks Michael about a book he wrote a long time ago, something about a relationship between a father and son.  Even the hotel manager mentions this book, but that's the end of it.  Michael's narration into the tape recorder is witty and definitely a good story as he explains the room.  When he is actually investigating in the beginning, he washes the room with a black light and discovers blood everywhere.  Flashes of the dead bodies appear as he crosses each blood spatter.  These are the ominous effects that you really enjoy, but they all get left behind, and there aren't very many of them anyway.Sometimes King just doesn't translate very well to the big screen sometimes.  Getting into the heads of his characters should be left to the written word. Cusack gives a good performance and is just the victim of a bad over-the-top script.  Samuel L. Jackson is just Samuel L. Jackson, he even works in his trademark F word.  Save this movie for a boring Sunday.  It won't cure the boredom, but it will kill an hour or two.",1,It rains. It snows.

Plus with Tales Season 2, you get 17 other spooktacular episodes to keep you entertained if you're 'dying' for more than 30 minutes of scares.I remember reading 1408 in Stephen King's collection of short storiesEverything's Eventual : 14 Dark Talesback in 2002. 1408 wasn't one of the most impressionable King stories from that collection, and the 2007 movie adaptation with John Cusack held suit...not impressionable. Not a bad movie, but certainly not a Horror film that will be remembered as great.There are some good scares (that reminded me of that Tales From the Crypt episode that I mentioned earlier) in 1408. 1408 held my attention well enough, and John Cusack does a stand-up job at what is practically a solo performance all the way through (with brief {but always excellent} appearances by Samuel L. Jackson). But all in all, 1408 seemed like one of those Horror movies that I'd seen before...and I don't mean because I'd read the short story years ago...I mean because it just wasn't that original.So unless you've got nothing else in your viewing queue, 1408 might be best viewed as a hey-look-what's-just-about-to-start-on-cable flick.",3,"You Can Check Out Anytime You Like, But You Can Never Leave",1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1789,"['famous', 'line', 'famous', 'song', 'EaglesHotel', 'Californiathat', 'sums', 'up', 'fate', 'enter', 'haunted', 'room', 'numbers', 'add', 'up', '13', '13th', 'floor', 'aka', '1408', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel.There', 'famous', 'line', 'famous', 'song', 'Fred', 'Astaire', 'Ginger', 'RogersLet', 'Call', 'Whole', 'Thing', 'Offthat', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'should', 'do', ""'re"", 'fence', 'buying', '1408.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'little', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'fraction', 'time', 'tell', '1408', 'did', 'check', 'out', 'episode', 'Television', 'Terror', 'Morton', 'Downey', 'Season', '2', 'Tales', 'CryptTales', 'Crypt', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'Tales', 'Season', '2', 'get', '17', 'other', 'spooktacular', 'episodes', 'keep', 'entertained', ""'re"", ""'dying"", 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'scares.I', 'remember', 'reading', '1408', 'Stephen', 'King', 'collection', 'short', 'storiesEverything', 'Eventual', '14', 'Dark', 'Talesback', '2002', '1408', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'most', 'impressionable', 'King', 'stories', 'collection', '2007', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Cusack', 'held', 'suit', 'not', 'impressionable', 'Not', 'bad', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'Horror', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'great.There', 'are', 'good', 'scares', 'reminded', 'Tales', 'Crypt', 'episode', 'mentioned', 'earlier', '1408', '1408', 'held', 'attention', 'well', 'enough', 'John', 'Cusack', 'stand-up', 'job', 'what', 'practically', 'solo', 'performance', 'way', 'brief', 'always', 'excellent', 'appearances', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', '1408', 'seemed', 'one', 'Horror', 'movies', ""'d"", 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'d"", 'read', 'short', 'story', 'years', 'mean', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'original.So', ""'ve"", 'got', 'nothing', 'else', 'viewing', 'queue', '1408', 'might', 'be', 'best', 'viewed', ""hey-look-what's-just-about-to-start-on-cable"", 'flick']",1408
656686,A2C5VCR3DYDPR2,B00005JPSE,Some Guy,"[4, 4]","This movie received mixed reviews from critics and star rankings here seem to be all over the place.  It may just come down to what you like.Here we have a character-driven thriller of the highest order, in my humble opinion.  I like John Cusack anyway, but whether he's one of your favorites or not, there's no denying he really carries this film.  From self-assured (almost self-absorbed) debunker of haunted places to a man panicking under the onslaught of a hotel room out to get him, he puts in a stellar performance.And so does the hotel suite itself.  It's so innocent and normal when he first steps in, you just know it's going to snap.  Things start off rather harmlessly but quickly escalate.  Cusack is so transparently in character that you simply watch him and forget who the actor is.  He jumps when startled with utter believability and stays within the bounds of his character throughout.  Waxing and waning between belief and denial, heartbreak and determination, he sucks you in and brings you along for the ride as this maniacal hotel room systematically breaks him down both psychologically and physically.For a PG-13 rated film, there's no shortage of genuine scariness, creepiness, and excitement.  There's no gore, of course, but this isn't a slash 'em up horror flick, this is a terror thriller that draws you in to a character's plight.Buy this two-disk version and you get the theatrical version plus a director's cut with an alternate ending.  For purists, the theatrical version is closer to Stephen King's original short story.  For those who haven't read it or don't expect movies to follow books to the letter, the alternate ending is just as satisfying, a little more challenging, and no worse for being different.  You can take your pick.If you'd like to be sucked into one man's plight in a hotel room that's out to get him (in classic Stephen King style the evil is environmental instead of a creature of some sort), this is a GREAT movie.  The pace is fast but not frenetic, there are some marvelously creepy moments (my favorite being when he waves out the window to the building across the street), and, again, Cusack really shines.

656690,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00005JPSE,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[2, 3]","1408 is the latest screen incarnation from the mind of Stephen King, one of my favorite authors, and this time Hollywood has well-adapted a story of his.King has traveled down this chilling haunted hotel road before with hisThe Shiningwhich was made into something of a minor classic by Stanley Kubrick; however, Kubrick's version ofThe Shiningturned left at some point when it should have turned right.  This time Hollywood got it right with King and much is due to Cusack's powerful performance from beginning to end.This time instead of having a never believable as sane Jack Nicholson as a tormented writer attempting to exercise his personal demons and plunging into madness, we have John Cusack who actually is believable as a sane writer who just might be going insane after one hour in an ""(expletive) evil room"" according to the wonderfully understated but sinister seeming Samuel L. Jackson who attempts to convince Cusack not to enter the room by giving him teasing tidbits that would entice anyone to want to just see the room.  He practices an evil reverse psychology with Cusack's character, Mike Enslin, that works like a charm.I don't want to spoil this review with giving away the plot twists, but just when you think the film is over and all is resolved satisfactorily . . . well . . . it ain't!  Clever writing, camera movement, and a surprisingly low-budget approach really add to the over chilling effect of this film.  Of course, this film really doesn't belong to the brilliant mind of Stephen King, but rather to John Cusack's flawless performance.  Is it Oscar-nomination material?  No, not really, but it's brilliant nevertheless and in what is basically a one character and one location film, he must and does carry the film.This film is worth running out to see and worth purchasing when it comes out on DVD even though it loses its punch a bit when the mystery is solved.

Another film about a writer being driven insane by an evil hotel, it offers a refreshing stop-over for horror fans seeking a rest from the torture porn excesses of Saw and Hostel, yet boasts none of the complexity, the intellectual nourishment or the intense creepiness of Kubrick's thematically similar horror masterpiece.What it does have in its favour is John Cusack.He plays Mike Enslin, a failed novelist who has managed to make a living debunking the presence of ghosts, ghouls and poltergeists in a series of bestselling guidebooks to America's most haunted hotels. His usual trick is to travel to some roadside motel where he'll be eagerly greeted by proprietors ready to regale him with tales of grizzly suicides and malign spirits haunting the rooms. He then tries to settle in for a good night's sleep, after making some effort towards, if not quite professionalism, then at least taking the job half-seriously.This all changes when he receives an anonymous postcard imploring him not to enter room 1408 in Manhattan's upscale Dolphin hotel. His interest suitably piqued, he calls up to reserve the room, only to be told it's unavailable - at all times. With the aid of his publisher's legal team, however, he manages to secure a reservation and flies from his home in California to check in, only to be greeted by the hotel's creepily officious manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), who pleads with him to take an alternative suite.His reasoning is simple---Four people have died horrible deaths under his watch and, in its 95-year existence, a litany of people have lost their lives by torturous means. Nevertheless, Mike is determined to check in and, sensing he's fighting a losing battle, Olin allows him to do so, ominously leaving him at the room's door to face a whole host of personal demons and malevolent spirits.Once he's shut off and isolated in the room, Cusack is also the kind of actor you don't mind spending the majority of a movie with, and he's great when Mike's cynicism gives way to disbelief and outright terror. The film has a few neat touches, too--I won`t give then away....It's too bad the film eventually goes overboard with CGI effects, but heck it kept me interested for a couple of hours.",4,I liked it-good acting by Cusack.....,1188691200,"09 2, 2007",2007,2513,"['movie', 'was', 'made', 'short', 'story', 'Stephen', 'King', '1408', 'minibar', 'version', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'take', 'Shining', 'everything', 'made', 'film', 'great', 'been', 'reduced', 'here', 'something', 'smaller', 'scale', 'easier', 'consume', 'significantly', 'less', 'satisfying', 'film', 'writer', 'being', 'driven', 'insane', 'evil', 'hotel', 'refreshing', 'stop-over', 'horror', 'fans', 'seeking', 'rest', 'torture', 'porn', 'excesses', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'yet', 'none', 'complexity', 'intellectual', 'nourishment', 'intense', 'creepiness', 'Kubrick', 'thematically', 'similar', 'horror', 'masterpiece.What', 'have', 'favour', 'John', 'Cusack.He', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'failed', 'novelist', 'who', 'managed', 'make', 'living', 'debunking', 'presence', 'ghosts', 'ghouls', 'poltergeists', 'series', 'bestselling', 'guidebooks', 'America', 'most', 'haunted', 'hotels', 'usual', 'trick', 'travel', 'roadside', 'motel', 'where', ""'ll"", 'be', 'eagerly', 'greeted', 'proprietors', 'ready', 'regale', 'tales', 'grizzly', 'suicides', 'malign', 'spirits', 'haunting', 'rooms', 'then', 'settle', 'good', 'night', 'sleep', 'making', 'effort', 'towards', 'not', 'quite', 'professionalism', 'then', 'least', 'taking', 'job', 'half-seriously.This', 'changes', 'when', 'anonymous', 'postcard', 'imploring', 'not', 'enter', 'room', '1408', 'Manhattan', 'upscale', 'Dolphin', 'hotel', 'interest', 'suitably', 'piqued', 'up', 'reserve', 'room', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'unavailable', 'times', 'aid', 'publisher', 'legal', 'team', 'however', 'secure', 'reservation', 'flies', 'home', 'California', 'check', 'only', 'be', 'greeted', 'hotel', 'creepily', 'officious', 'manager', 'Gerald', 'Olin', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'who', 'take', 'alternative', 'suite.His', 'reasoning', 'simple', '-Four', 'people', 'have', 'died', 'horrible', 'deaths', 'watch', '95-year', 'existence', 'litany', 'people', 'have', 'lost', 'lives', 'torturous', 'means', 'Nevertheless', 'Mike', 'determined', 'check', 'sensing', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'Olin', 'do', 'so', 'ominously', 'leaving', 'room', 'door', 'face', 'whole', 'host', 'personal', 'demons', 'malevolent', 'spirits.Once', 'shut', 'off', 'isolated', 'room', 'Cusack', 'also', 'kind', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'spending', 'majority', 'movie', 'great', 'when', 'Mike', 'cynicism', 'way', 'disbelief', 'outright', 'terror', 'film', 'few', 'neat', 'touches', 'too', 'won', 't', 'give', 'then', 'away', 'too', 'bad', 'film', 'eventually', 'overboard', 'CGI', 'effects', 'heck', 'kept', 'interested', 'couple', 'hours']",1408

I think the short story is probably the scariest thing King has ever written, and the definitive haunted room story. I've been hoping for years that somebody would do a film adaptation, but King is notoriously difficult to adapt to film. Moreover, I don't remember hearing anything about a theatrical release, and the first I heard of it was a TV ad for the DVD. Worse, there were scenes in the TV trailer that I knew were not in the story, so clearly the short story had been expanded for the screen--usually bad news with a King story (Children of the Corn, anyone?).To my great delight, the film fully does justice to the short story, and is probably the best Stephen King adaptation since The Shining. The additions and elaborations are fully in spirit of the original. There are a couple of things from the story missing, but they are things that would have been difficult to convey on film.John Cusak turns in a tour de force performance, most of it solo, as the jaded writer of occult travelogues who tries to spend the night in the evil room 1408. Samuel Jackson is also excellent as the hotel manager, in a scene that is almost verbatim from the book, and prime Steven King.

656696,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00005JPSE,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 3]","Treading the familiar Stephen King territory of a writer thrown into the horrors of supernatural chaos, 1408 is more Shining than Misery, but Cusack retains the redeeming pathos-inducing personality of the latter's troubled novelist. Choosing to use atmosphere and mood over blood and guts to increase suspense, Mikael Hafstrom's thriller admirably shies away from cheap scares and ghostly Ring-like little girls to slowly build a searing psychological terror where the audience might lose their cool before Cusack's character does.Mike Enslin's (John Cusack) tragic past provokes him to seek out the most notorious of haunted houses and other typical phantom hangouts and debunk the existence of such afterlife entities. After writing several less-than-successful ""top 10"" haunted locale books, Enslin happens upon a postcard warning to stay away from room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. Unable to resist, Enslin insists upon staying in the ""evil"" room that has claimed 56 lives and boasts a foreboding one-hour maximum life expectancy for its occupants. Ignoring the pleads of the Dolphin's manager (Samuel L. Jackson), Enslin embarks on a nightmarish night of supernatural torment where he must battle impending psychosis, paranormal devilry, and his own inner demons... and he may not last ten minutes let alone one hour.Perhaps its greatest accomplishment, 1408's emphasis on atmosphere and setting over blood packets and gore effects keeps it refreshingly new though its premise dabbles in the horror stories of old. Those expecting the elaborately grotesque tortures of Saw and Hostel may be disappointed in the psychological terrors that reign supreme in this haunted hotel room, but just as effective (if not more so) is the steady building of unbearable torment on Mike Enslin's rapidly crumbling psyche. And through his faltering rationalizations, we too begin to lose our calm. Once the mysterious happenings transform into supernatural disturbances, the likes of which Enslin can no longer pass off as cunning trickery from the hotel manager, he must face his inner demons as well as the deceptive visions brought forth by the hellish room. When the inevitable jumpy scares finally do arrive, we're so worked up by the terrifying setting and nerve-wracking mental deterioration of our protagonist that we jump even higher out of our seats.As Cusack's character changes from stubborn skeptic to mortified victim, his surroundings shift in appearance as well, almost like a less drastic Silent Hill, where the walls crack and bleed and an icy chill blankets the room in frost. The usage of such visual change in setting (especially later, when stormy waves flood the room) helps to keep Enslin a stranger in his surroundings, and therefore the audience as well, even though the film practically takes place all in one small location. The normally static environment becomes an unpredictable location where anything can happen.1408 is virtually a one-man show, and Cusack embodies the perfect victim and empathetic host to the horrors unfolding. At first he is obstinately confident in the nonexistence of ghosts and such supernatural phenomena, but as the notorious one-hour time limit counts down (thanks to an unnerving alarm clock with a mind of its own), Enslin realizes just how wrong his assumptions were. An ingenious plot device has him dictate his thoughts into a tape recorder, allowing the audience to participate in his initially logical thought process that quickly deteriorates into a frantic rationalization of the eerie events he witnesses, and ultimately the realization that he will die in the cursed hotel room.Though infused with plenty of cynical humor, the steadily increasing dread can't be shaken from Hafstrom's clever adaptation of Stephen King's short story. An inspired performance from Cusack keeps the suspense high and the hope of escape low, and the rising fear and paranoia parallel such horror greats as The Shining and Audition (as do the skillful psych-outs that toy with the audience and Enslin). And while our protagonist may be able to talk his way out of being frightened by the terrifying events unfolding (at least for a short while), chances are the audience won't be able to do the same.- Joel Massie",4,1408 Movie Review,1182643200,"06 24, 2007",2007,4258,"['Treading', 'familiar', 'Stephen', 'King', 'territory', 'writer', 'thrown', 'horrors', 'supernatural', 'chaos', '1408', 'more', 'Shining', 'Misery', 'Cusack', 'redeeming', 'pathos-inducing', 'personality', 'latter', 'troubled', 'novelist', 'Choosing', 'use', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'blood', 'guts', 'increase', 'suspense', 'Mikael', 'Hafstrom', 'thriller', 'admirably', 'away', 'cheap', 'scares', 'ghostly', 'Ring-like', 'little', 'girls', 'slowly', 'build', 'searing', 'psychological', 'terror', 'where', 'audience', 'might', 'lose', 'cool', 'Cusack', 'character', 'Enslin', 'John', 'Cusack', 'tragic', 'past', 'provokes', 'seek', 'out', 'most', 'notorious', 'haunted', 'houses', 'other', 'typical', 'phantom', 'hangouts', 'debunk', 'existence', 'such', 'afterlife', 'entities', 'writing', 'several', 'less-than-successful', 'top', '10', 'haunted', 'locale', 'books', 'Enslin', 'postcard', 'warning', 'stay', 'away', 'room', '1408', 'New', 'York', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'Unable', 'resist', 'Enslin', 'staying', 'evil', 'room', 'claimed', '56', 'lives', 'foreboding', 'one-hour', 'maximum', 'life', 'expectancy', 'occupants', 'Ignoring', 'pleads', 'Dolphin', 'manager', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Enslin', 'nightmarish', 'night', 'supernatural', 'torment', 'where', 'must', 'battle', 'impending', 'psychosis', 'paranormal', 'devilry', 'own', 'inner', 'demons', 'may', 'not', 'last', 'ten', 'minutes', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'greatest', 'accomplishment', '1408', 'emphasis', 'atmosphere', 'setting', 'over', 'blood', 'packets', 'gore', 'effects', 'refreshingly', 'new', 'premise', 'dabbles', 'horror', 'stories', 'old', 'expecting', 'elaborately', 'grotesque', 'tortures', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'psychological', 'terrors', 'reign', 'supreme', 'haunted', 'hotel', 'room', 'just', 'effective', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'steady', 'building', 'unbearable', 'torment', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'rapidly', 'crumbling', 'psyche', 'faltering', 'rationalizations', 'too', 'begin', 'lose', 'calm', 'mysterious', 'happenings', 'transform', 'supernatural', 'disturbances', 'likes', 'Enslin', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'pass', 'off', 'cunning', 'trickery', 'hotel', 'manager', 'must', 'face', 'inner', 'demons', 'as', 'well', 'deceptive', 'visions', 'brought', 'forth', 'hellish', 'room', 'When', 'inevitable', 'jumpy', 'scares', 'finally', 'do', 'arrive', ""'re"", 'so', 'worked', 'up', 'terrifying', 'setting', 'nerve-wracking', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'protagonist', 'jump', 'even', 'higher', 'seats.As', 'Cusack', 'character', 'changes', 'stubborn', 'skeptic', 'mortified', 'victim', 'surroundings', 'shift', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'almost', 'less', 'drastic', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'where', 'walls', 'crack', 'bleed', 'icy', 'chill', 'room', 'frost', 'usage', 'such', 'visual', 'change', 'setting', 'especially', 'later', 'when', 'stormy', 'flood', 'room', 'keep', 'Enslin', 'stranger', 'surroundings', 'therefore', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'film', 'practically', 'place', 'one', 'small', 'location', 'normally', 'static', 'environment', 'unpredictable', 'location', 'where', 'anything', 'can', 'happen.1408', 'virtually', 'one-man', 'show', 'Cusack', 'perfect', 'victim', 'empathetic', 'host', 'horrors', 'unfolding', 'first', 'obstinately', 'confident', 'nonexistence', 'ghosts', 'such', 'supernatural', 'phenomena', 'notorious', 'one-hour', 'time', 'limit', 'counts', 'down', 'thanks', 'unnerving', 'alarm', 'clock', 'mind', 'own', 'Enslin', 'just', 'how', 'wrong', 'assumptions', 'were', 'ingenious', 'plot', 'device', 'dictate', 'thoughts', 'tape', 'recorder', 'allowing', 'audience', 'participate', 'initially', 'logical', 'thought', 'process', 'quickly', 'frantic', 'rationalization', 'eerie', 'events', 'ultimately', 'realization', 'will', 'die', 'cursed', 'hotel', 'room.Though', 'infused', 'plenty', 'cynical', 'humor', 'steadily', 'increasing', 'dread', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'shaken', 'Hafstrom', 'clever', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'short', 'story', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Cusack', 'suspense', 'high', 'hope', 'escape', 'low', 'rising', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'parallel', 'such', 'horror', 'greats', 'Shining', 'Audition', 'do', 'skillful', 'psych-outs', 'toy', 'audience', 'Enslin', 'protagonist', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'talk', 'way', 'being', 'frightened', 'terrifying', 'events', 'unfolding', 'least', 'short', 'while', 'chances', 'are', 'audience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'do', 'same.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",1408

Can watch it over and over and still love it everytime....Still very happy they went with the so called ""happy ending"". The alternate ending was OK, but drastically changes the entire tone of the movie.....I thought I would hate this movie but what a surprise......The more times I watch it the better it keeps getting and that is the sign of an excellent movie..when it never gets old watching it many times.....I will leave my original review below untouched and give an update pertaining to my question about the alternate ending in my below review.My feeling has not changed. EXCELLENT movie. I did get to view the 2nd disc and can say the following....considering you can pick up the 2 disc for almost nothing at your local used dvd/cd/gaming store I would go ahead and get the 2 disc version.However, thank g-d they put out the theatrical version instead of the alternate ending extended cut. I never thought 5 - 8 minutes could make so much differance to the entire impact of the whole movie. It lost ALOT with the extended cut...100% different tone/scope...leaves you with a very ""unsatisfied"" feeling...the original was awesome in my opinion.....the extended cut was good in that it got more screen time for Samuel Jackson but it turned the movie in to a 5 star, watch over and over, type movie ( I have it on my dvr and watch it frequently..never gets old....) in to a 2 star watch once with no desire to watch again, type feeling....If you can get the extended cut 2 disk version on the cheap, I say go for it as it is worth checking out..if not..dont worry....the original version is SO MUCH better!! But I wont spoil either by giving away what happened ;>)This got alot of negative reviews so I was expecting to put the disc in and stop watching within 1/2 hour or so. Nope, I was quite surprised at how great this movie was. John Cusak was simply excellent in this film....possibly his best on screen performance ever. Was never a real big fan of his....Thought he was OK...liked most of his movies but never really thought of him as a ""great actor""....This changed my opinion...very few could have given such a great performance as he did....Wont go over the plot since so many already have...but it was simply a great movie..one that started out with a boring 3 or 4 minutes followed by the movie getting better and better every minute that went by until the fantastic ending occured. Regarding the ending..As I said, I thought it was GREAT...caught me surprise...pretty much thought the movie was over and then the ending that blew my mind.....I saw the original version (as some call it...""the happy ending"")..Not so sure it was ""happy"".....but it was EXCELLENT!! Now, can anybody tell me what happens in the alternate ending that some say was better and others say was worse? Thanks to any that respond....Very curious to know how the alternate ending version went.......This movie may not be for everybody but if you like this ""type"" of movie, I think you will like it....Cant speak for the alternaten ending....If anybody can post what happens in the Alternate ending it would be much appreciated....",5,March 2009 Update -DUEL ENDINGS-EXCELLENT!!,1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,3157,"['Update-Never', 'get', 'tired', 'one', 'Can', 'watch', 'still', 'love', 'everytime', '.Still', 'very', 'happy', 'went', 'so', 'called', 'happy', 'ending', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'OK', 'drastically', 'entire', 'tone', 'movie', '..I', 'thought', 'would', 'hate', 'movie', 'what', 'surprise', 'more', 'times', 'watch', 'better', 'getting', 'sign', 'excellent', 'movie..when', 'never', 'old', 'watching', 'many', 'times', '..I', 'will', 'leave', 'original', 'review', 'untouched', 'give', 'update', 'pertaining', 'question', 'alternate', 'ending', 'review.My', 'feeling', 'not', 'changed', 'EXCELLENT', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'view', '2nd', 'disc', 'can', 'say', 'following', '.considering', 'can', 'pick', 'up', '2', 'disc', 'almost', 'nothing', 'local', 'used', 'dvd/cd/gaming', 'store', 'would', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', '2', 'disc', 'version.However', 'thank', 'g-d', 'put', 'out', 'theatrical', 'version', 'instead', 'alternate', 'ending', 'extended', 'cut', 'never', 'thought', '5', '8', 'minutes', 'could', 'make', 'so', 'much', 'differance', 'entire', 'impact', 'whole', 'movie', 'lost', 'ALOT', 'extended', 'cut', '100', '%', 'different', 'tone/scope', 'very', 'unsatisfied', 'feeling', 'original', 'was', 'awesome', 'opinion', '..the', 'extended', 'cut', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'turned', 'movie', '5', 'star', 'watch', 'type', 'movie', 'have', 'dvr', 'watch', 'frequently..never', 'old', '2', 'star', 'watch', 'once', 'desire', 'watch', 'again', 'type', 'feeling', 'can', 'get', 'extended', 'cut', '2', 'disk', 'version', 'cheap', 'say', 'go', 'worth', 'checking', 'out..if', 'not..dont', 'worry', '.the', 'original', 'version', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'better', 'wont', 'spoil', 'giving', 'away', 'what', 'happened', '>', 'got', 'alot', 'negative', 'reviews', 'so', 'was', 'expecting', 'put', 'disc', 'stop', 'watching', '1/2', 'hour', 'so', 'Nope', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'John', 'Cusak', 'was', 'simply', 'excellent', 'film', '.possibly', 'best', 'screen', 'performance', 'ever', 'Was', 'never', 'real', 'big', 'fan', '.Thought', 'was', 'OK', 'liked', 'most', 'movies', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'great', 'actor', '.This', 'changed', 'opinion', 'very', 'few', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'great', 'performance', 'did', '.Wont', 'go', 'plot', 'so', 'many', 'already', 'have', 'was', 'simply', 'great', 'movie..one', 'started', 'out', 'boring', '3', '4', 'minutes', 'followed', 'movie', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'minute', 'went', 'fantastic', 'ending', 'occured', 'Regarding', 'ending..As', 'said', 'thought', 'was', 'GREAT', 'caught', 'surprise', 'pretty', 'much', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'then', 'ending', 'blew', 'mind', 'saw', 'original', 'version', 'call', 'happy', 'ending', '..Not', 'so', 'sure', 'was', 'happy', '..but', 'was', 'EXCELLENT', 'Now', 'can', 'anybody', 'tell', 'what', 'alternate', 'ending', 'say', 'was', 'better', 'others', 'say', 'was', 'worse', 'Thanks', 'respond', '.Very', 'curious', 'know', 'how', 'alternate', 'ending', 'version', 'went', '.This', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everybody', 'like', 'type', 'movie', 'think', 'will', 'like', '.Cant', 'speak', 'alternaten', 'ending', 'anybody', 'can', 'post', 'what', 'Alternate', 'ending', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'appreciated']",1408

656699,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00005JPSE,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[12, 14]","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) writes books about haunted places. He doesn't really believe in the whole idea, but it helps pay the bills and allows him to live in Hermosa Beach and catch an occasional wave on his surfboard. His books sell well, but his celebrity is dwindling, so as he looks for a subject to end his current book, he receives a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel in New York City. ""Do Not Enter Room 1408"" the postcard reads. Mike's research reveals a number of deaths have occurred throughout the years in this room, room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. He calls to make a reservation and the room seems to be permanently booked. All of this naturally piques the interest of the disbeliever. He talks to his publisher (Tony Shalhoub) and the publisher's lawyer agrees to help. When Mike arrives, the manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bribe, plead, threaten, scare and entice Mike to cancel his planned stay in room 1408. ""That room is evil"" he tells the writer. ""No one has stayed in there for more than an hour."" Mike won't have any of it and heads upstairs. As soon as he is in the room, Mike starts dictating his thoughts and notes for the book. Then, some strange things start to happen.""1408"" is based on a Stephen King short story and it does something that few `horror' films do today. It is actually scary. The current trend in horror films, thrillers, what ever word you want to use to classify them, is to make them as gory and bloody as possible. ""1408"" builds a fair amount of psychological horror, scares that occur in Mike's mind, allowing our thoughts to fill in the details. This type of horror is always more scary than simply watching a bunch of knives, some blood, gory murders, the like.Director Mikael Hafstrom, whose last film was my least favorite film of 2005, ""Derailed"", does a really good job of establishing Mike's character, his background, his current animosity towards his line of work, everything that would make him a skeptic. So when Mike enters room 1408, we almost believe what he believes, that he won't see anything, nothing will happen.But then, there would be no need to pay $11 to see a movie called ""1408"" if that were the case, right?The screenwriters, Mike Greenberg and Scott Alexander (Alexander worked on the screenplays for ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Man on the Moon"" among others) deserve credit for adapting the short story by Stephen King into a fairly well rounded feature length film. They add a lot of back story for Mike, help establish his skepticism by showing us a visit he makes to another haunted inn, and much more. They have filled in a lot of the details King only hinted at in the original story.This is basically John Cusack's film. There are brief moments with Samuel L. Jackson, Tony Shalhoub, Mary McCormack and others, but once Cusack's Mike enters that room, everything is about what happens to his character and what his character does in response.So it is important for the details of Mike's character to be established ahead of time. Hafstrom and the screenwriters have done a lot of this work, but without Cusack's performance, the film would fail.Let's talk about John Cusack for a moment. Cusack is a remarkably underrated actor. Not an A-lister, he is, nonetheless, remarkably good. Sure, he has his share of missteps (""Must Love Dogs"", ""The Ice Harvest"" anyone?) but when he is in a film, I can almost always count on at least an interesting film which has been elevated by his performance. Yet in most of his films, Cusack's performance adds significantly to the overall quality of the film, delivering some quirky, excellent, memorable films. ""Grosse Point Blank"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Say Anything"", ""Being John Malkovich"" all contain a unique, quirky performance from Cusack that helps to elevate the film.In ""1408"", Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of books about haunted places. Throughout the film, we get further hints about Mike's past, his dreams, his failures, and these all help to contribute to his character. These moments aren't superfluous; they all mean something and add to the horror he later experiences. For instance, Mike doesn't really believe in haunted places, but the books he writes pay the bills, so he feigns interest and belief. Also, he once had dreams of being a great writer, and is surprised when a woman comes to a book signing with his lone fiction title, a much dog eared paperback that she wants him to autograph. The book's appearance is like a knife in his heart.But the most important part of his past lies in his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter. Naturally, when an evil spirit is trying to drive someone mad, they will use the most precious memories that person holds dear to aid in the process. And evil, evil room 1408 is no exception. It knows all about Mike's past and uses this information to drive the skeptic over the edge.Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Gerald Olin. He seems to genuinely care about Mike's welfare and doesn't want him to stay in the room. But the role is very small and the filmmakers do themselves an injustice by listing Jackson as one of the stars of the film. His role is really a cameo and if it had been billed as such, his appearance would help provide a nice little boost to the film.If you are familiar with Stephen King's writing, he has written many short stories about things becoming possessed by evil spirits and haunting `reg'lar' folks. Dogs, classic cars, cats, toys, the like. Many of these stretch the credibility factor, but still remain very watch able. In ""1408"", a hotel room is possessed by evil spirits. And you know, it works. Because the film takes some time to set up Mike's skepticism towards haunted places, he enters the room a disbeliever. Since we are living this story through Mike, we also enter the room a disbeliever. Once he begins to experience the various freakish things, we feel the freakish things.Virtually all of the horror in ""1408"" is derived from events or circumstances in Mike's life. And this makes the film all the creepier because it is slightly more believable. I can't really believe I am using this word when discussing a film about an evil hotel room, but there you have it. The film is believable for long stretches of time because we believe in Mike, and John Cusack's portrayal of the character. In fact, the film has very little blood or gore; there are a couple of shots of some of the other people who have died in the room but most of these are in black and white. And this is such a welcome change of pace from the current `norm'.""1408"" was a big surprise.",3,3 1/2 - A Big Surprise - Actually Scary,1182988800,"06 28, 2007",2007,6608,"['Mike', 'Enslin', 'John',

It will be a real ghost hunt, a la 'The Haunting', or even, 'The Haunting of Hell House'"". I was really looking forward to seeing it, and it was Halloween, too, for heavens sake.Sadly, though, it's a directionless, meandering bore.  The ""horror"" is more like improvisation, bringing with it only low-grade ""pop-up"" dramatic effects that work by surprise and little else.In fairness to John Cusack, I don't know that anyone could have made this inane smorgasbord attempt at horror work any better than he did. It just kept on looking like this boring twenty-something in reaction to these ""frightening"" stimuli. It just didn't work.  You watch Cusack bounce around from one little horror-vignette to another and get more and more bored. Cusack is all hard-boiled when he gets to the hotel, stone-faced with toughness in the face of the warnings, then, he's ready to bolt out the bedroom window in fifteen minutes. And not that much had even happened yet. Lurch, halt, lurch, halt, etc., etc.Samuel L. Jackson has a formidable presence, and I'd hoped that he might be able to help the story, but it was pretty obvious a short way into the movie that he was mis-cast, and probably should have stayed on that plane with the snakes....Truthfully, this was such a boring movie that I fell asleep in the middle of it, but awoke in time to resume my impression of being thoroughly disappointed. To like this thing you're probably going to have to be a died-in-the-wool King fan, and you're going to have to like the twenty-something cuteness of Cusack, no matter how ridiculous it appears in this movie.

The Dolphin Hotel's ""Room 1408"" is actually ""an evil room,"" the hotel manager says, where more than 50 guests have committed suicide there (one drowned in his chicken soup). Ignoring the warning words of the manager, a jaded writer Mike Enslin checks in the room where he encounters a series of creepy events. Mike, who doesn't believe in these paranormal events, must endure the terrifying 60 minutes there.Had it not been for John Cusack who plays the skeptic protagonist Mike, ""1408"" could have been an unwatchable mess. John Cusack and his strong acting successfully provide tension and occasional humor to the familiar story while the superb production designs and the photography of the dimly-lit interiors give the film an authentic feel. Samuel L. Jackson appears as the hotel manager Gerald Olin, but his role is just an extended cameo and the film is virtually about Cusack's hero and the room itself.However, in spite of its gripping first half, the film gradually loses steam, not knowing where to go. Whatever the room does, the room does anyway, and there are not many options it can eventually take. The Carpenters song is a nice touch, but director Mikael Hfstr&ouml;m takes too much time to lead us to the climax, and some of the tricks you will see are nothing new and sometimes look repetitious.""1408,"" based on a Stephen King short, has familiar elements seen in numerous haunted house stories (in book or film) of the past, most notably, ""The Shining"" - both stories centering on isolated space, for example - but their approach is different.

Rogers,"[0, 0]","The number of films adapted from a work by Stephen King are too numerous to list here; but, the number of excellent movies based on a story or novel by the horror maestro is a lot shorter--The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, Stand By Me, Misery, The Dead Zone, Hearts of Atlantis, Delores Clairborn, The Mist, Cujo, and now, 1408.  This movie, starring John Cusack, was one of the best films that I saw last year, and the Director's Cut with an alternate ending on the special two-disc DVD collection is just as good, if not better in my opinion.For those of you not familiar with either the story or film, John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a man who travels around the country and debunks the myth of haunted houses and rooms, publishing the results in his ""occult travel guides.""  He simply doesn't believe in the afterlife or the supernatural, or anything for that matter, especially since the death of his young daughter from an illness.  Everything changes, however, when he visits the Dolphin Hotel in New York City and stays in the infamous Room 1408.  Though the manager of the hotel (played wonderfully by Samuel L. Jackson) warns him about the dangers of the room and the large number of people who have died there, Cusack's character thinks it's all a bunch of hot air, designed to attract people to the hotel and increase the business's revenue.  Once Cusack gets settled into the room, things start happening to slowly change his mind and by the last quarter of the film, he's struggling just to stay alive.  That's when he decides to fight back and to figure out a way to destroy the room and its evil.For me, this was one of John Cusack's best roles.  He carried ninety percent of the film on his shoulders and did so brilliantly.  I believed in him and his character, and I desperately wanted Mike Enslin to make it out of the room alive.  Samuel L. Jackson also did a great job as the smooth talking manager who knows the truth about Room 1408 and decides to let John Cusack do what he has to do.  The special effects of the film are believable and extremely intense and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, spilling the popcorn on the floor.  I also have to say that though I really enjoyed the theatrical version of the movie, I think the Director's Cut on the two-disc set was even better.  It was longer with an additional seventeen minutes added to the last third of the film, and the alternate ending was more realistic.  If you're a fan of Stephen King's writing, or an avid viewer of horror flicks, I would highly recommend this movie.  It's one of the better films to be done from the horror writer's stories and definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in the last few years.",5,One of the better Stephen King adaptations!,1214438400,"06 26, 2008",2008,2726,"['number', 'films', 'adapted', 'work', 'Stephen', 'King', 'are', 'too', 'numerous', 'list', 'here', 'number', 'excellent', 'movies', 'based', 'story', 'novel', 'horror', 'maestro', 'lot', 'shorter', 'Green', 'Mile', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Stand', 'Me', 'Misery', 'Dead', 'Zone', 'Hearts', 'Atlantis', 'Delores', 'Clairborn', 'Mist', 'Cujo', 'now', '1408', 'movie', 'starring', 'John', 'Cusack', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'saw', 'last', 'year', 'Director', 'Cut', 'alternate', 'ending', 'special', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'collection', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'opinion.For', 'not', 'familiar', 'story', 'film', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'man', 'who', 'country', 'myth', 'haunted', 'houses', 'rooms', 'publishing', 'results', 'occult', 'travel', 'guides', 'simply', ""n't"", 'believe', 'afterlife', 'supernatural', 'anything', 'matter', 'especially', 'death', 'young', 'daughter', 'illness', 'Everything', 'changes', 'however', 'when', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'stays', 'infamous', 'Room', '1408', 'manager', 'hotel', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'dangers', 'room', 'large', 'number', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'died', 'there', 'Cusack', 'character', 'bunch', 'hot', 'air', 'designed', 'attract', 'people', 'hotel', 'increase', 'business', 'revenue', 'Once', 'Cusack', 'settled', 'room', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'slowly', 'change', 'mind', 'last', 'quarter', 'film', 'struggling', 'just', 'stay', 'alive', 'when', 'fight', 'back', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'destroy', 'room', 'evil.For', 'was', 'one', 'John', 'Cusack', 'best', 'roles', 'carried', 'ninety', 'percent', 'film', 'shoulders', 'did', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'believed', 'character', 'desperately', 'wanted', 'Mike', 'Enslin', 'make', 'room', 'alive', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'also', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'smooth', 'talking', 'manager', 'who', 'truth', 'Room', '1408', 'let', 'John', 'Cusack', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'special', 'effects', 'film', 'are', 'believable', 'extremely', 'intense', 'will', 'have', 'sitting', 'edge', 'seat', 'spilling', 'popcorn', 'floor', 'also', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'theatrical', 'version', 'movie', 'think', 'Director', 'Cut', 'two-disc', 'set', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'was', 'longer', 'additional', 'seventeen', 'minutes', 'added', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'alternate', 'ending', 'was', 'more', 'realistic', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Stephen', 'King', 'writing', 'avid', 'viewer', 'horror', 'flicks', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'be', 'done', 'horror', 'writer', 'stories', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'few', 'years']",1408
656715,A1DORQXHAAR8J9,B00005JPSE,"William H. Kelsey ""seeker of truth""","[4, 7]","Perhaps Hollywood has lost the ability to shock and scare us since life itself gives us so many horrific true life visions every night on the news and such, but every horror film I've seen in the past 20 years has fallen flat. They're either unintelligent gore fest like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" or teen breast shows like the ""Friday the 13th"" series. None have risen up to the benchmark of the originial ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The best new horror film I've seen lately is the ""Hitcher"" which does actually have some shock moments but nothing truly frightening. As for this film, I wanted to like it, I really did. I enjoy both of the lead actors (John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson) and they both do a great job with the script that they're given. Unfortunately, the script's not much. Basically, Cusack plays a disillusioned writer whose genre is supposedly haunted travel sights but does not believe in anything supernatural himself (obviously this is a jab at the ""new"" atheist movement of Dawkins and Harris). He receives a postcard about a hotel room in NYC where evryone who has stayed there dies and of course he must go there himself. From there, he meets hotelier Jackson who begs him not to entre the room and gives him the detailed account of its history. Sounds good, doesn't it? Well, unfortunately, it only goes down hill from there. The special effects, which are supposed to be so creepy, simply strike one as cheesy and ho-hum. The end, which the dvd cover describes as ""leaving you gasping"", simply left me shrugging ""So what?"" Of course it would end that way. There are absolutely no surprises here. Watch it if you have nothing else to do for 90 min. or so, but otherwise don't waste your time.",2,Disappointing.,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1727,"['Perhaps', 'Hollywood', 'lost', 'ability', 'shock', 'scare', 'life', 'so', 'many', 'horrific', 'true', 'life', 'visions', 'night', 'news', 'such', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'past', '20', 'years', 'fallen', 'flat', ""'re"", 'unintelligent', 'gore', 'fest', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'teen', 'breast', 'shows', 'Friday', '13th', 'series', 'None', 'have', 'risen', 'up', 'benchmark', 'originial', 'Halloween', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'best', 'new', 'horror', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'Hitcher', 'actually', 'have', 'shock', 'moments', 'nothing', 'truly', 'frightening', 'film', 'wanted', 'like', 'really', 'did', 'enjoy', 'lead', 'actors', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'script', ""'re"", 'given', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'not', 'much', 'Basically', 'Cusack', 'disillusioned', 'writer', 'genre', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'travel', 'sights', 'not', 'believe', 'anything', 'supernatural', 'obviously', 'jab', 'new', 'atheist', 'movement', 'Dawkins', 'Harris', 'postcard', 'hotel', 'room', 'NYC', 'where', 'evryone', 'who', 'stayed', 'dies', 'course', 'must', 'go', 'there', 'there', 'hotelier', 'Jackson', 'who', 'begs', 'not', 'entre', 'room', 'detailed', 'account', 'history', 'good', ""n't"", 'Well', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'down', 'hill', 'there', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'creepy', 'simply', 'strike', 'one', 'cheesy', 'ho-hum', 'end', 'dvd', 'cover', 'leaving', 'gasping', 'simply', 'left', 'shrugging', 'So', 'what', 'course', 'would', 'end', 'way', 'are', 'absolutely', 'surprises', 'here', 'Watch', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', '90', 'min', 'so', 'otherwise', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time']",1408

I too am growing weary of movies masquerading themselves as horror films these days, when all they offer are ludicruous plot lines and excess gore, violence and gratuituous sex.By comparison, 1408 exceeds all expectations when taken for what it is - an intelligent horror movie that despite being rated a tame PG-13 delivers chills, thrills, and a strong performance by its lead actor, John Cusack, as well as a good supporting role by Samuel L Jackson. The story centers around a jaded author, Mike Enslin [John Cusack] who pens 'true horror' books but is actually a skeptic who doesn't believe in the afterworld or entities associated with it. He receives a cryptic postcard one day that tells him 'Do Not Enter 1408' -being a room in the Dolphin Hotel in NY, where Enslin has left behind a painful past.The rest of the movie picks up pace very quickly and viewers are in for a thrill ride as Enslin manages to overcome the protestations of the hotel manager [Samuel Jackson] and spends the night in 1408, which has one of the grisliest & bloody reputations in the annals of hotel history. Enslin finds his skepticism melting in the face of the unbelievable horrors he faces in 1408, and struggles to keep his wits about him to survive.The horror in this movie is very palpable - there is no gore or excess violence, but there's a pervasive sense of menace and evil that sends chills down one's spine, and a couple of jump-out-your-seat moments[not to mention a couple of plot twists]. But what truly lifts this movie is the strong & riveting performance by John Cusack. The whole movie basically revolves around him and it is amazing to watch an actor bring so much depth to his role as well as portray a feeling of alienation, isolation and paranoia as Enslin tries to face his fears in 1408.I am a fan of atmospheric horror movies, and 1408 ranks as one of my favorite horror movies [ The Haunting, Changeling, Rosemary's Baby, The Shining being some of my other favs]. If you're a fan of the horror genre, or simply a fan of psychological drama & thrillers, then 1408 should please you.",5,"An above- average, atmospheric horror thriller",1189036800,"09 6, 2007",2007,2185,"['1408', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'story', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'too', 'am', 'growing', 'weary', 'movies', 'masquerading', 'horror', 'days', 'when', 'offer', 'are', 'ludicruous', 'plot', 'lines', 'excess', 'gore', 'violence', 'gratuituous', 'sex.By', 'comparison', '1408', 'expectations', 'when', 'taken', 'what', 'intelligent', 'horror', 'movie', 'being', 'rated', 'tame', 'PG-13', 'delivers', 'chills', 'thrills', 'strong', 'performance', 'lead', 'actor', 'John', 'Cusack', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'supporting', 'role', 'Samuel', 'L', 'Jackson', 'story', 'centers', 'jaded', 'author', 'Mike', 'Enslin', '[', 'John', 'Cusack', ']', 'who', 'horror', 'books', 'actually', 'skeptic', 'who', ""n't"", 'believe', 'afterworld', 'entities', 'associated', 'cryptic', 'postcard', 'one', 'day', ""'Do"", 'Not', 'Enter', '1408', '-being', 'room', 'Dolphin', 'Hotel', 'NY', 'where', 'Enslin', 'left', 'behind', 'painful', 'past.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'up', 'pace', 'very', 'quickly', 'viewers', 'are', 'thrill', 'ride', 'Enslin', 'overcome', 'protestations', 'hotel', 'manager', '[', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', ']', 'night', '1408', 'one', 'grisliest', 'bloody', 'reputations', 'annals', 'hotel', 'history', 'Enslin', 'skepticism', 'melting', 'face', 'unbelievable', 'horrors', '1408', 'keep', 'wits', 'survive.The', 'horror', 'movie', 'very', 'palpable', 'gore', 'excess', 'violence', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'menace', 'evil', 'chills', 'down', 'one', 'spine', 'couple', 'jump-out-your-seat', 'moments', '[', 'not', 'mention', 'couple', 'plot', 'twists', ']', 'what', 'truly', 'movie', 'strong', 'riveting', 'performance', 'John', 'Cusack', 'whole', 'movie', 'basically', 'amazing', 'watch', 'actor', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'depth', 'role', 'as', 'well', 'portray', 'feeling', 'alienation', 'isolation', 'paranoia', 'Enslin', 'face', 'fears', '1408.I', 'am', 'fan', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'movies', '1408', 'ranks', 'one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'movies', '[', 'Haunting', 'Changeling', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'Shining', 'being', 'other', 'favs', ']', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'genre', 'simply', 'fan', 'psychological', 'drama', 'thrillers', 'then', '1408', 'should', 'please']",1408
