But even she couldn't save this film from sub par status.  Jennifer plays a very self centered employee of an advertising agency (she lies about her credentials to get the job), whose number one goal is to become a popular socialite.  She falls in love with an attorney who likes her but is turned off by her stuck up persona.  She eventually dumps the fake attitude to win the guy over.  Jennifer is too sweet of an actress to do a credible job playing a ""bad girl.""  But even despite that fact, the film is slow moving, very predictable, and just plain boring.

Unfortunately it's nothing more than an excuse to film Jennifer Love Hewitt in as many revealing outfits as possible within a limited amount of time.Plot: Katya Livingston (Jennifer) is a beautiful but obnoxious, self-centered ad executive who lies, cheats and sleeps her way up the social ladder. Aided by her flamboyant best friend Ferguson (Joey Lawrence) she worms her way through the film reeking havoc wherever she goes.Jennifer is unquestionably a very attractive young lady and I'll be the first to admit that just knowing she's in a film is enough to peek my interest, however even the lovely Jennifer cannot save this one.

952417,A3I7OX03X6KDMN,B000BXJ1X8,"Chris Roberts ""Chris Roberts""","[7, 15]","The thing about this film that I eventually had to come to terms with is that it is not an examination of the disconnect between San Francisco socialites and Africa orphans. The fact that the orphans showed up at all lead me to believe that the filmmakers realize that they truly do exist, even if the characters do not. Rather this film is a case study in everything that is wrong with female entertainment in 2006. Beyond the fact that it is shallow to pine over characters pining over expensive merchandise, there is an overriding theory here and elsewhere that you too can be insufferable and still get the hunk so long as you are beautiful. Jennifer Love Hewitt shows up here working the blow up doll look to provide us with a repugnant role model. For the vast majority of the film we watch her obsess over the most vapid things imaginable: social gatherings, weight loss, white teeth, and career advancement. And the problem is that girls out there are blissfully sucking this garbage up not knowing that they are being indoctrinated into the chick lit mindset.The message of the film is really the least of its worries. Its values are really no worse than what you would find on ""Entourage,"" a show I love. Of course ""Entourage"" has a few advantages, namely real characters, real emotions, real humor, and real scripts. Hewitt, who clearly has some sort of phobia of serious work, continues her downward spiral towards obscurity. Here she is picking up a paycheck for looking great and over acting. The director also appears to hate subtlety of any kind. The writer's idea of a running gag involves some chump who works everywhere Katya (Hewitt) goes. And after ""Empire Falls"" last year I never again want to hear the excuse that the film sucks because it is made for TV. Sorry slackers, the bar has been raised. There is a little empty pleasure to be gleaned and there are two legitimate chuckles, but that is all. To call this a cheese fest would be an insult to cheese.Since there really are people like Katya in the world we can't say that there is no justifiable reason for this film. It's not Katya's fault that she was born minus brain cells and her type could be just as interesting as any other type. But thanks to everybody involved in this disaster there is just nothing interesting to be found. It does, however, land another blow to the conventional wisdom that says that ambition leads to wealth. We are asked to believe that this girl pulls in a six figure income even though we never see her working (even though we do see her at work). Then we are asked to believe that she got that far simply by being a very ambitious liar. That way we can believe that she ""earned"" her money as opposed to facing the truth which is that ambition leads to hurt feelings and rich parents lead to wealth. As long as we believe that we can ignore the stated message of this film (don't be a sociopath), and instead focus on the real one: Be rich, be beautiful, be a socialite. In other words, believe that Paris Hilton has ambition. **",2,Jennifer Love Hewitt Lays Another Bomb,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,3042,"['thing', 'film', 'eventually', 'had', 'come', 'terms', 'not', 'examination', 'disconnect', 'San', 'Francisco', 'socialites', 'Africa', 'orphans', 'fact', 'orphans', 'showed', 'up', 'lead', 'believe', 'filmmakers', 'realize', 'truly', 'do', 'exist', 'even', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'Rather', 'film', 'case', 'study', 'everything', 'wrong', 'female', 'entertainment', '2006', 'Beyond', 'fact', 'shallow', 'pine', 'characters', 'pining', 'expensive', 'merchandise', 'overriding', 'theory', 'here', 'elsewhere', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'insufferable', 'still', 'get', 'hunk', 'so', 'long', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'up', 'here', 'working', 'blow', 'up', 'doll', 'look', 'provide', 'repugnant', 'role', 'model', 'vast', 'majority', 'film', 'watch', 'obsess', 'most', 'vapid', 'things', 'imaginable', 'social', 'gatherings', 'weight', 'loss', 'white', 'teeth', 'career', 'advancement', 'problem', 'girls', 'are', 'blissfully', 'sucking', 'garbage', 'up', 'not', 'knowing', 'are', 'being', 'indoctrinated', 'chick', 'lit', 'mindset.The', 'message', 'film', 'really', 'least', 'worries', 'values', 'are', 'really', 'worse', 'what', 'would', 'find', 'Entourage', 'show', 'love', 'course', 'Entourage', 'few', 'advantages', 'namely', 'real', 'characters', 'real', 'emotions', 'real', 'humor', 'real', 'scripts', 'Hewitt', 'who', 'clearly', 'sort', 'phobia', 'serious', 'work', 'downward', 'spiral', 'towards', 'obscurity', 'Here', 'picking', 'up', 'paycheck', 'looking', 'great', 'acting', 'director', 'also', 'hate', 'subtlety', 'kind', 'writer', 'idea', 'running', 'gag', 'chump', 'who', 'everywhere', 'Katya', 'Hewitt', 'Empire', 'Falls', 'last', 'year', 'never', 'again', 'want', 'hear', 'excuse', 'film', 'sucks', 'made', 'TV', 'Sorry', 'slackers', 'bar', 'been', 'raised', 'little', 'empty', 'pleasure', 'be', 'gleaned', 'are', 'two', 'legitimate', 'chuckles', 'call', 'cheese', 'fest', 'would', 'be', 'insult', 'cheese.Since', 'really', 'are', 'people', 'Katya', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'justifiable', 'reason', 'film', 'not', 'Katya', 'fault', 'was', 'born', 'minus', 'brain', 'cells', 'type', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'interesting', 'other', 'type', 'thanks', 'everybody', 'involved', 'disaster', 'just', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'be', 'found', 'however', 'land', 'blow', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'ambition', 'wealth', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'girl', 'six', 'figure', 'income', 'even', 'never', 'see', 'working', 'even', 'do', 'see', 'work', 'Then', 'are', 'asked', 'believe', 'got', 'far', 'simply', 'being', 'very', 'ambitious', 'liar', 'way', 'can', 'believe', 'earned', 'money', 'opposed', 'facing', 'truth', 'ambition', 'hurt', 'feelings', 'rich', 'parents', 'lead', 'wealth', 'As', 'long', 'believe', 'can', 'ignore', 'stated', 'message', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'sociopath', 'instead', 'focus', 'real', 'one', 'Be', 'rich', 'be', 'beautiful', 'be', 'socialite', 'other', 'words', 'believe', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'ambition', '**']",N/A

952433,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BXJ1X8,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Jennifer Love Hewitt is the star of this not-so-funny made-for-TV romantic comedy ""Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber,"" which is based on the book of the same title by Adele Lang. In spite of the intriguing title, the film mainly relies on the clich&eacute;d ideas about fame, money, love and office workers' life in San Francisco, and doesn't have anything new to tell. Worse, the film doesn't even know in what way we should look at this anti-heroine Katya Livingstone, 28, whose only purpose of life seems climbing up the social ladder.Are we supposed to side (or laugh) with Katya, who never hesitates to use her co-workers and ex-boy friends to get what she wants? It is pretty demanding for anyone to identify with this very annoying social climber, who seems to need only two things in her life: invitation to the biggest party of the year and the hunky Mr. Right who is on the fourth floor of her company's building. But I don't see any social satire or anything funny about seeing Jennifer Love Hewitt's character donating some money for an African orphan, or giving useless financial advice to the boy. At least, the flat and tasteless direction of this film, where our silly heroine kills animals (twice) her boss keeps by doing supposedly `humorous' things, is not clearly up to the task of making social commetaries or providing us with really funny moments.If we are supposed to hate and despise her, it would be a much easier task. I know obviously this is not the filmmakers' intention, and as the original book was written in the style of a diary (like Bridget Jones), Katya's unlikable traits should not be taken as face value. I know as much, and Ms. Hewitt almost managed to pull off the impossible, being nasty and lovable at the same time, but like Lindsay Lohan and her recent flop ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,"" equally irritating comedy drama, most viewers just stop being interested, and perhaps say, ""Why should we care?"" And I could find not many reasons.",2,"In Spite of the Gorgeous Star Jennifer Love Hewitt, This Is Yet Another Cliched Comedy",1178496000,"05 7, 2007",2007,2001,"['Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'star', 'not-so-funny', 'made-for-TV', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Confessions', 'Sociopathic', 'Social', 'Climber', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'Adele', 'Lang', 'spite', 'intriguing', 'title', 'film', 'mainly', 'clich', 'eacute', 'ideas', 'fame', 'money', 'love', 'office', 'workers', 'life', 'San', 'Francisco', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'new', 'tell', 'Worse', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'way', 'should', 'look', 'anti-heroine', 'Katya', 'Livingstone', '28', 'only', 'purpose', 'life', 'climbing', 'up', 'social', 'ladder.Are', 'supposed', 'side', 'laugh', 'Katya', 'who', 'never', 'use', 'co-workers', 'ex-boy', 'friends', 'get', 'what', 'pretty', 'demanding', 'anyone', 'identify', 'very', 'annoying', 'social', 'climber', 'who', 'need', 'only', 'two', 'things', 'life', 'invitation', 'biggest', 'party', 'year', 'hunky', 'Mr', 'Right', 'who', 'fourth', 'floor', 'company', 'building', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'social', 'satire', 'anything', 'funny', 'seeing', 'Jennifer', 'Love', 'Hewitt', 'character', 'donating', 'money', 'African', 'orphan', 'giving', 'useless', 'financial', 'advice', 'boy', 'least', 'flat', 'tasteless', 'direction', 'film', 'where', 'silly', 'heroine', 'kills', 'animals', 'twice', 'boss', 'keeps', 'doing', 'supposedly', 'humorous', 'things', 'not', 'clearly', 'up', 'task', 'making', 'social', 'commetaries', 'providing', 'really', 'funny', 'moments.If', 'are', 'supposed', 'hate', 'despise', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'task', 'know', 'obviously', 'not', 'filmmakers', 'intention', 'original', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'style', 'diary', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Katya', 'unlikable', 'traits', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'know', 'as', 'much', 'Ms.', 'Hewitt', 'almost', 'managed', 'pull', 'off', 'impossible', 'being', 'nasty', 'lovable', 'same', 'time', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'recent', 'flop', 'Confessions', 'Teenage', 'Drama', 'Queen', 'equally', 'irritating', 'comedy', 'drama', 'most', 'viewers', 'just', 'stop', 'being', 'interested', 'perhaps', 'say', 'Why', 'should', 'care', 'could', 'find', 'not', 'many', 'reasons']",N/A
