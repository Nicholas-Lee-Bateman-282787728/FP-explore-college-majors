Velasquez,"[16, 16]","It seems like yesterday when Russia invaded Afghanistan, with the so-called mission of ""fulfilling our international duty, by assisting the brotherly people of Afghanistan in repulsing imperialist aggression."" Well, we already know that this enterprise was a failure, and ""9th Company"" is a film that we really need in current times, when history seems to be forgotten very, very fast and repeated in an incredibly stupid manner. It is brutal and honest, a truly penetrating and unforgettable film.The movie begins in 1988, when a group of Siberians which volunteered to join the army and fight in Afghanistan are about to depart for boot camp. We meet the young men whose life we will follow throughout the film. From Siberia they are transported to Ferghana, Uzbekistan, where they will spend three months of training before going to the front. The men in charge of breaking them in is drill sergeant Dygalo (Mikhail Porechenkov, in a superb performance) and Captain Bystov (Aleksey Kravchenko, in another amazing performance), who informs them that ""the most important thing to remember is that Islam is not just another religion. It is another world, with its own laws, a different view of life and death. A true Muslim is not afraid to die in battle - killing an infidel is a heroic deed, a stairway to heaven."" And off they go to Baghram, Afghanistan, where they are divided into two companies: 4th and 9th.  As the name of the picture implies, we follow the 9th Company until the very end, and gradually witness their evolution in the war. This was one of the last companies to leave Afghanistan during the Russian final withdrawal on February 9, 1989, after almost ten years of engagement.Under the direction of Fyodor Bondarchuk, this film has a lot in common with Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket (1987), in which its two hours are basically divided into two parts. The first hour is about the training and the second one is about the actual war. However, ""9th Company"" feels more real and visceral - with some very funny moments, too --, and we get a clear picture of why the Russians could not defeat the Mujahideen resistance. Not in vain, Captain Bystov also told his men: ""In the entire history, no one ever managed to conquer Afghanistan. No one... Never...""  Funny enough, the line that keeps popping up all along the movie is, ""Your motherland won't forget this.""  This film was based on real events which took place on January 8, 1989, on Height 3234, in the Khost Province, Afghanistan. Perhaps our men in Washington could leave the comfort in their lives and take a look at this movie. The Blu-Ray edition of the movie includes trailers and English language and subtitles.

This film, which I bought and have watched 4 times, provides a fairly realistic glimpse into the tragic Soviet occupation of Afghanistan through the eyes of a handful of pretty typical Soviet youth that are conscripted in to service.I think my Amazon profile may mention that I spent several years living in Soviet Occupied East Germany in the 1980's not to mention another 6 or 7 years after the collapse of The German DDR. While there I lived and worked initially in and around The City of Zerbst which was home to the largest Soviet Air Base outside of The USSR. As such I had a LOT of interaction with Russian soldiers, mostly the young conscripts who lived a tough existence on base. Based on my memories of those years I felt that the depiction of the soldiers in this mover were really accurate in general. This alone will be enough to interest many viewers  in buying or renting this excellent movie.Other potential viewers may be very interested in seeing the military hardware, uniforms, small arm weaponry, etc. The dvd also offers the English speaking audience to either read the subtitles or select the version dubbed in English.

Based! that is and certainly not a true story any more than Full Metal Jacket is a true story but based on the Experience of the Vietnam War. Anyone looking up the real events this film is based upon will be greatly disappointed, it is not a true story but an interpretation of the War the Soviets fought in Afganistan. Good to clear that up!This film was very popular upon its release in Russia, the culture is changing and as was with Vietnam movies in the US now a generation in Russia is looking for the untold story of Afganistan. In fact these experiences are on par. Full Metal Jacket is also the movie to compare it with for the story unfolds in a like manner, we follow new recruits from the start then through training on to deployment in Afganistan then to combat and finally a last battle.The first part of the movie I thought was really good, the cast is a mismatched bunch of men turn into soldiers. Not many Hollywood faces and very gritty stories to the side make it very entertaining. One could say brutally funny. The second part at trainig is also impressive (even if you have seen movies like it before), they have the drill sergeant from Hell: Praporshik Dygalo. He pushes them and breaks them down harder than any other drill sergeant but as it turns out because he wants them to survive. The third part, deployment in Afganistan is also good, soldiers life of hurry up and wait, what to do to spend time, alcohol and such. Also the newcomers are nothing to the veterans. And then on to the forth part which is a bit of a let down. Plenty of explosions but not very good battle scenes and it is more reminiscent of old action movies with a lot of silly heroics. And an end that has nothing to do with the events the movie is based upon. As with Star the Russian film industry is just making an entry into modern filmmaking and they have a lot of catching up to do, but I think they will get there fast.The first 3 parts of the movie are very entertaining and then it lets you down a bit but is still very watchable. Cinematography is here and there excellent and the Russians seem to have access to a considerable amount of military hardware. There is a scene with two Hind Helicopters flying that is very impressive but then you also have battle scenes that have plenty of explosions but bad choreography.I enjoyed the film but don't consider it a masterpiece.

It is very true that all of the movie / video game images that a person may have seen, fade to nothingness when one is in the midst of human beings being shredded, dismembered or bleeding out, surrounded by screams, confusion and mental/ emotional adrenaline overload. There is no comparison. this movie does as credible a job as most in capturing the realism but again, no movie is really going to nail it.The character development is a little slow at first but the movie gathers momentum as it progresses. And here is the reason that I say I found it depressing.SPOILER ALERT::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Although it is indeed based on real events, dramatized a bit, the final battle scenes are, in their own way, reminiscent of the prolonged battle scene in the Mel Gibson movie, ""We Were Soldiers Once"", or perhaps the initial battle scenes in ""Blackhawk Down"" - they do capture the feeling of almost hopeless, overwhelming, ""Oh God, will this never end???"" emotion that touches a warrior in battle. Yet having grown to know and understand most of the characters in the film, seeing their humanity and learning of their all-too-familiar hopes and fears, dreams and plans for a future, by the movie's end we have seen every one of our new acquaintances except for one -  blown apart, stabbed to death, shredded by mortar fire or RPG fire of machine gun fire ... we have watched all of our young 'heroes' save one, bleed out, go into shock or collapse into a bloody mass of burned flesh and blood soaked, ripped clothing... and learn that the Red Army in its evacuation, simply forget these men who were left alone to die defending a hillside which the army no longer needed.So in that sense, I did find it depressing.

They also in reality had Hind gunship support for the two days- not just at the end of the firefight. The Soviet colonel did make a faux statement about Afghanistan never being conquered- Genghis Khan did, but of course, he just killed any villagers who got in the way- no illusions of nation building!What I liked about this movie is that it was made about 2 years after the Soviet Union collapsed, and the movie was quite brutally honest about the Soviet experience there.

It's a raw recruit to battlefield story just like those movies, showing how Soviet soldiers were build from raw recruits to what they become, seasoned soldiers. It falls flat on all points from cinematography to even a plot, though. It's like a 70s B movie in production values, cheap and cheesy, only thing missing is the red tint of Fuji film.I felt the story so wanting since the interplay between the soldiers is quite shallow (when the beginning of the story shows smack and sex talk, you know the rest of the plot isn't going to have much more substance. Cheap filler as interaction, not complex socio-psychological bonding). Emotional scenes -- even the sex scene in the movie -- are too rushed and plastic, there wasn't enough ""pregnant pause"" time to take in the gravity of the situation (a soldier's death, for example, is gut hurting time in buddy movies...that's not even there...even out of creativity [starkness of war effect, so seen in ""Saving Private Ryan""]). The actors have the potential to do more solid acting too -- and you can see it -- but the script and direction straitjackets them.""A picture is worth a thousand words"", but if the camera stays still longer than 5 seconds in this movie, it's a miracle. One of the protagonists in this story is an artist even. Does the movie take time to reflect what is happening even through his eyes? No. The story is a choppy race to a conclusion. Even soldiers appreciate their environment like anyone else, they're not robots. Behind that rough and tough exterior, they're human beings. They laugh and cry, when buddies die it hurts. That gravity isn't shown in this buddy war movie.Giving this 2 stars because it shows brothers-in-arms from another country, but I can't even give it a third star due to the production values. It suffers that much. Remake it with new director and story, and then it can make the Oscars, it does have that potential if the buddy part is highlighted. It's the chemistry in the foxhole that's important, and by extension the launch pad for why they're fighting/who they're fighting/what they're fighting for -- not treating a movie like an ""A-Team"" episode on TV (and without the buddy chemistry of even that series).",2,Lackluster Story in Need of a Director and Script,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",2013,2367,"['movie', 'point', 'blank', 'suffers', 'poor', 'editing', 'story.This', 'not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'All', 'Quiet', 'Western', 'Front', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Jacket', 'raw', 'recruit', 'battlefield', 'story', 'just', 'movies', 'showing', 'how', 'Soviet', 'soldiers', 'were', 'build', 'raw', 'recruits', 'what', 'become', 'seasoned', 'soldiers', 'flat', 'points', 'cinematography', 'even', 'plot', 'though', '70s', 'B', 'movie', 'production', 'values', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'red', 'tint', 'Fuji', 'film.I', 'felt', 'story', 'so', 'wanting', 'interplay', 'soldiers', 'quite', 'shallow', 'when', 'beginning', 'story', 'smack', 'sex', 'talk', 'know', 'rest', 'plot', ""n't"", 'going', 'have', 'much', 'more', 'substance', 'Cheap', 'filler', 'interaction', 'not', 'complex', 'socio-psychological', 'bonding', 'Emotional', 'scenes', 'even', 'sex', 'scene', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'rushed', 'plastic', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'pregnant', 'pause', 'time', 'take', 'gravity', 'situation', 'soldier', 'death', 'example', 'gut', 'hurting', 'time', 'buddy', 'movies', 'not', 'even', 'even', 'creativity', '[', 'starkness', 'war', 'effect', 'so', 'seen', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', ']', 'actors', 'have', 'potential', 'do', 'more', 'solid', 'acting', 'too', 'can', 'see', 'script', 'direction', 'straitjackets', 'picture', 'thousand', 'words', 'camera', 'still', 'longer', '5', 'seconds', 'movie', 'miracle', 'One', 'protagonists', 'story', 'artist', 'even', 'movie', 'take', 'time', 'reflect', 'what', 'happening', 'even', 'eyes', 'story', 'choppy', 'race', 'conclusion', 'Even', 'soldiers', 'appreciate', 'environment', 'anyone', 'else', ""'re"", 'not', 'robots', 'rough', 'tough', 'exterior', ""'re"", 'human', 'beings', 'laugh', 'cry', 'when', 'buddies', 'die', 'gravity', ""n't"", 'shown', 'buddy', 'war', 'movie.Giving', '2', 'stars', 'brothers-in-arms', 'country', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'give', 'third', 'star', 'due', 'production', 'values', 'much', 'Remake', 'new', 'director', 'story', 'then', 'can', 'make', 'Oscars', 'have', 'potential', 'buddy', 'part', 'highlighted', 'chemistry', 'foxhole', 'important', 'extension', 'launch', 'pad', 'why', ""'re"", 'fighting/who', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'fighting', 'not', 'treating', 'movie', 'A-Team', 'episode', 'TV', 'buddy', 'chemistry', 'even', 'series']",N/A
