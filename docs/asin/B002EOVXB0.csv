1265485,A2M3NO8VMO7P0U,B002EOVXB0,A. Beck,"[2, 4]","A dark and twisted zombie tale involving two high school friends who discover a living ""dead girl"" in the boiler room of an abandoned mental hospital.  Instead of notifying the authorities of their discovery, J.T. (played by Noah Segan) decides that they should keep it a secret between the two and use the girl as a personal sex slave.  The other teen, Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) having some sense of moral values and common sense, is completely against the idea and wars with himself as to whether or not he should intervene in his friend's repulsive plan.People often say that there's nothing that hasn't already been done in the zombie sub-genre, but then something like this comes along and makes you completely rethink that statement. `Deadgirl' isn't  so much a conventional horror film as it is a character study on moral indecency.  Yes there are zombies and death, but in `Deadgirl' the human race are portrayed as the actual ""monsters"" with teenage hormones trampling ethical human behavior.I must say that despite the vulgarity of it all, I love all of the characters in this film and their relationships with one another...superb writing skills on the part of Trent Haaga...and even though the subject matter might sound rather disturbing, Trent manages to throw in some hilarious comic relief to lighten the mood.  What happens when your zombie sex slave is starting to look a little too decrepit?  Do what J.T. does and tape a picture of a hot chick over her face!`Deadgirl', is probably the most original zombie film I've ever seen and despite its low budget, the film succeeds in every way.  The film really has no weakness whether you're talking about the writing, directing, acting, makeup effects, music, jump scares, suspense, etc..  This is the kind of film George A.

1265486,AJASGOXDLFHR9,B002EOVXB0,Ace,"[2, 6]","A group of male teens stumble across a near dead & bound female in an abandoned Hospital. With little care as to who may have left her for dead and why, they decide to keep her as their sex slave. Variations of this theme dot the cinematic landscape, with perhaps THE COLLECTOR, being the most noteworthy in the legitimate film category. DEAD GIRL, however, is apparently a Zombie film, though such was not played out well. On the plus side this is a slick, (though sick), well produced film, that is NOT a comedy. Just because teens are featured, (who behave like teens), does not make the picture funny. Read some of my other reviews where I discuss this viewer disconnect from reality. Geesh. Anyhow, Caution Spoilers ahead: As usual in much of contemporary cinema; DEAD GIRL portrays men as misogynist beasts, regardless of whether they are high school stoners, dweebs or jocks who are willing to engage in oral sex with a rage infested...woman...zombie...failed lab experiment... Take your pick. This scene and the events which led up to it were not credible, nor was the hand wringing dweeb who repeatedly failed to do what was right and call the police. Apparently he was afraid of JT, the film's main sicko though he had the stones to basically tell his alcoholic dad to ""F-O"". After slicing off the stoner dude's hand, (he was armed with a machete that would do ""Jason"" justice), he drops the weapon and runs from JT. Go figure. Even less credible was the buxom babe who gets nailed in the head by a tire iron at warp speed, though proceeds to lay a savage beating on the 2 wacko male protagonists. Again, this was not a credible scene, especially after the film maker demonstrated that she had a fractured skull after being hit. In reality, she would have instantly been killed by such a blow. Further, that the sex slave had boundless energy when needed, though if she was a Zombie, that is OK. That said, DEAD GIRL could not decide whether it was a Horror film or a drama. The Zombie girl angle should have been better developed. As it stands, DEAD GIRL teases as it only flirts with the Zombie (which is actually a sub plot in the film). I kept waiting for the film to ""jump"", but alas, such was not to be. There was also a lot of talk and I found myself watching the clock. Major questions also remained unanswered such as; ""Where did it come from""? Don't think she laid there for perhaps decades as the Hospital had been abandoned for some time. Also, no one seemed to care about missing girls and dying guys. Where were the authorities? Also some scenes were a little confusing as I believe they were actually dream sequences. The ending also made little sense. Short of giving it away, let me just say that once a dweeb, always a dweeb, (and I don't think that he would have done what he did). DEAD GIRL could have been so much better, but as it stands this is another marginal or even a fair outing with an interesting sub plot (that was poorly developed). That said, this is a sick and offensive film which sends a number of bad messages out to young people, like rape is OK, (albeit with a Zombie?). Not for all tastes, though fans of Zombie cinema & ""Survivalist Horror"" may be interested. **1/2 stars.",2,Offensive though Interesting & flawed **1/2 stars,1260921600,"12 16, 2009",2009,3223,"['group', 'male', 'teens', 'stumble', 'near', 'dead', 'bound', 'female', 'abandoned', 'Hospital', 'little', 'care', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'left', 'dead', 'why', 'decide', 'keep', 'sex', 'slave', 'Variations', 'theme', 'cinematic', 'landscape', 'perhaps', 'THE', 'COLLECTOR', 'being', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'legitimate', 'film', 'category', 'DEAD', 'GIRL', 'however', 'apparently', 'Zombie', 'film', 'such', 'was', 'not', 'played', 'out', 'well', 'plus', 'side', 'slick', 'sick', 'well', 'produced', 'film', 'NOT', 'comedy', 'Just', 'teens', 'are', 'featured', 'who', 'behave', 'teens', 'not', 'make', 'picture', 'funny', 'Read', 'other', 'reviews', 'where', 'discuss', 'viewer', 'disconnect', 'reality', 'Geesh', 'Anyhow', 'Caution', 'Spoilers', 'ahead', 'usual', 'much', 'contemporary', 'cinema', 'DEAD', 'GIRL', 'men', 'misogynist', 'beasts', 'regardless', 'are', 'high', 'school', 'stoners', 'dweebs', 'jocks', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'engage', 'oral', 'sex', 'rage', 'infested', 'woman', 'zombie', 'failed', 'lab', 'experiment', 'Take', 'pick', 'scene', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'were', 'not', 'credible', 'was', 'hand', 'wringing', 'dweeb', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'failed', 'do', 'what', 'was', 'right', 'call', 'police', 'Apparently', 'was', 'afraid', 'JT', 'film', 'main', 'sicko', 'had', 'stones', 'basically', 'tell', 'alcoholic', 'dad', 'F-O', 'slicing', 'off', 'stoner', 'dude', 'hand', 'was', 'armed', 'machete', 'would', 'do', 'Jason', 'justice', 'weapon', 'JT', 'Go', 'figure', 'Even', 'less', 'credible', 'was', 'buxom', 'babe', 'who', 'nailed', 'head', 'tire', 'iron', 'warp', 'speed', 'though', 'proceeds', 'lay', 'savage', 'beating', '2', 'wacko', 'male', 'protagonists', 'Again', 'was', 'not', 'credible', 'scene', 'especially', 'film', 'maker', 'demonstrated', 'had', 'fractured', 'skull', 'being', 'hit', 'reality', 'would', 'have', 'instantly', 'been', 'killed', 'blow', 'Further', 'sex', 'slave', 'had', 'boundless', 'energy', 'when', 'needed', 'was', 'Zombie', 'OK.', 'That', 'said', 'DEAD', 'GIRL', 'could', 'not', 'decide', 'was', 'Horror', 'film', 'drama', 'Zombie', 'girl', 'angle', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'developed', 'DEAD', 'GIRL', 'only', 'Zombie', 'actually', 'sub', 'plot', 'film', 'kept', 'waiting', 'film', 'jump', 'alas', 'such', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'talk', 'found', 'watching', 'clock', 'Major', 'questions', 'also', 'remained', 'unanswered', 'such', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'Do', ""n't"", 'think', 'laid', 'perhaps', 'decades', 'Hospital', 'had', 'been', 'abandoned', 'time', 'Also', 'one', 'seemed', 'care', 'missing', 'girls', 'dying', 'guys', 'Where', 'were', 'authorities', 'Also', 'scenes', 'were', 'little', 'confusing', 'believe', 'were', 'actually', 'dream', 'sequences', 'ending', 'also', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'Short', 'giving', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'once', 'dweeb', 'always', 'dweeb', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'what', 'did', 'DEAD', 'GIRL', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'marginal', 'even', 'fair', 'outing', 'interesting', 'sub', 'plot', 'was', 'poorly', 'developed', 'said', 'sick', 'offensive', 'film', 'number', 'bad', 'messages', 'out', 'young', 'people', 'rape', 'OK', 'Zombie', 'Not', 'tastes', 'fans', 'Zombie', 'cinema', 'Survivalist', 'Horror', 'may', 'be', 'interested', '**1/2', 'stars']",Deadgirl

He bails on the situation only to find out later that J.T. has recruited other high-school males into his crazy deadgirl rape club.

She is not dead-she moves, but no one knows where she came from or how she got into such a state.There are two directors of Deadgirl, important because the movie changes in the middle. At first you think it is doing to be film heavy about depravity and brutality.But the film goes to black comedy. There are references to Night Of The Living Dead, Heathers, River's Edge--if Deadgirl had been made in 1990, Crispan Glover would have been perfect for the bad boy-all sorts of horror and dark humor conventions.This works better: from the start there is a nagging implausibility to Deadgirl. A round of bullets is pumped into her but she remains half alive. Why? Search me--I dunno, but search the damn film, it does not know, either.Deadgirl sometimes being such a sloppy mess, over the top black comedy makes the whole plot easier to assimilate.Still,  some of the acting is really good. The protagonist is understated, and the actor uses a minimal style letting the action happen around him, and this works.All of this is a lot of fun, even if this film careens all over the place.

1265501,A3MU9G6YWKTGTA,B002EOVXB0,Cary L. Brown,"[7, 9]","I had this film recommended to me by someone I know and trust.  The recommender is NOT a ""horror film fan"" and made it clear that this was a disturbing film.  So, I waited a while to watch it.Let's be clear up-front.  This is a difficult movie to watch.  It is not happy, it is not fun, and it is not full of adventure.  It is, however, deeply emotional and deeply moral.  It is, in the end, a modern example of the classical ""fairy tale"" concept.The classical fairy tale has NOTHING to do with the modern ""Disney-fied"" concept we think of most often today.  Fairy tales were set in the real world and contemporary period (or at least the real world as understood by the audience who the story was created for, and in their own timeframe).  The target audience was intended to be able to imagine themselves, in their own ordinary lives, encountering this situation.Such a story was seldom ""happy"" and as often as not was dark, violent, and had an unhappy ending for the story's characters (even Goldilocks was eaten by the bears, after all).  These stories were told to make moral points...  creating situations that the audience might never have encountered but would make that audience CONSIDER what it would be like to be faced with the sort of moral choices or matters of judgment which the story presented.  If you make the right choice... yes, you can ""live happily ever after"" but if you don't, things go very , very badly.That's what this movie is all about.  It's a fictionalized, fantasy-ized FAIRY TALE about two people who are faced with a moral situations which tests their nature... and the two very different directions they could take... and how the wrong choice, or even failing to make the right choice up-front, can both lead to very, very bad consequences.The characters in this film are all there to play archetypical roles.The lead character, Ricky, represents most of us, frankly...  and is there for us to view the movie's world through.  We see his choices... both good, bad, and ""never really made at all,"" and we see the consequences of his choices.At the outset of the movie JT, the other ""lead"" is almost indistinguishable from Ricky, except that he's slightly more self-assured, less self-doubting.  If anything, he seems more appealing at first.  But as the movie progresses, you see that this ""appealing"" characteristic is actually the tip of an iceberg, just under the surface, which he learns to let out as the movie progresses.  Much like how, except for a twist of fate, a man might have been a marginally successfully Austrian house painter, but instead gained a degree of power and chose to let his inner darkness out, bringing about some of the best known evils in modern history.Other characters are also archetypes.There is the ""weak henchman"" who seems very neutral at first but eventually ceases to even be human...  almost like a ""lesser demon"" to JT's almost Satanic behavior (including his efforts to tempt Ricky into joining his cause)There is the ""bully"" character who leads Ricky into making his first real step along the ""morality is flexible"" road.  It's hard for a viewer to NOT agree, at the time we're watching, with how Ricky deals with this character... though upon reflection, you realize that it was his own bad choices which led to that inevitable result.There is the ""object of unrequited love"" who at first seems sympathetic but eventually proves to be less human than the titular ""dead girl,"" but who Ricky never ceases to virtually worship, even as she mocks him for his devotion.And, of course, there is the title character herself, the (never named) ""dead girl.""  We never learn who she is, but I, at least, WANT to know.  She is, in the end, the most sympathetic character in the film... the only one whose fate seem to be unrelated to any choices on her part.  And the one time when she actually DOES have a choice...  let's just say it's one about a door, or Ricky...  near the end of the film, her choice is very, very interesting, and in no way what would be expected from a ""Zombie.""Is she a ""Zombie?""  That's debatable.  She's clearly not ""fully human"" anymore but we don't know how, or why, she became this way, or how she ended up in that basement.  She is, simply, a ""victim.""  That there are ways that those who prey upon her can justify doing so... ie, that she's ""not human""...  is not something which is PRAISED in the film, but rather is shown for the evil it truly is.  Real-life sexual predators view women in much the same way that JT and others in this film view her...  and those caught up in the fringes of that life, as Ricky is in this film, may try to do the right thing, but may be torn between ""their friends"" and even their whole life as they know it, and this moral choice.Who is she?  All I know about her for certain is that she's an iconic presentation of the purely innocent victim, subjected to dehumanization and misfortune which are not her choice... and the only choice she gets to make in the entire film occurs at the end... and is VERY significant.I want to know more about her... who she was... who she IS.  I've known real women who have been put through similar (if non-fictional) situations, and have managed, over time, to recover and ""become human"" again.  I see this character as a fictional stand-in for every victim of sexual predation, confinement, and dehumanization who's ever lived.  She's not a ""monster"" at all... and if you expect for her to be the stereotypical movie zombie, you're going to hate this film.  She's the victim who eventually triumphs over her captors...  and any ""zombi-ism"" is primary there as a catalyst for explaining the way that her captors treat her as being less than human, which is something which could not be done in a conventional film, as the audience could never, even for an instant, be able to see the pure socioopathy of JT or his stoner henchman, or of the two jocks, otherwise, without rejecting it utterly.This is a movie about sociopathy.  It's a morality tale about consequences of choices, or of LACK of choices for that matter.  It uses zombie-ism only as a means to convey to non-sociopathic audience members how the sociopaths see the world, without causing those non-sociopathic to entirely shut down.Ricky is not a sociopath.  JT is.  Ricky's object of attention is a narcisist.  The two jocks are also sociopaths, but in a different way than JT...  they're compensating for different things in their lives.  Ricky is a victim, in a sense, but he could make the right decision at any time, and only at the end does he try to do so...  and by then, it's too late to fix everything, and there are inevitable consequences.  He may be ""broken"" at the end but he's still acting from a moral, if somewhat twistedly so, perspective.If you go into this movie looking for a fun viewing experience, you will be disappointed. If you want a ""resident evil"" type horror adventure, you're wasting your time.  This is a pure psychologically-grounded morality tale...  and very much a fairy tale in the classical sense.  Watch it, from that perspective, and you can enjoy it and even learn from it.  Watch it for any other reason, and you're likely to be offended or disgusted...  or, if you're a sociopath yourself, perhaps for titilation value.I enjoyed the film for the morality tale aspects of it...  but was utterly repulsed by the actions of the various characters.  As the makes of the film clearly intended.This film shows evil...  and how evil has consequences.  We all know people like Ricky, who ""go along"" with evil to avoid losing something we hold dear, but we know that this never works out well in the end.  We all know people like JT, who may seem ""OK"" as long as they have no real power, but who will let all their inner demons out at the first opportunity once they have any form of power over anyone (say, for instance, their children, as often happens in real life) and who, if given real power, would bring about evil on a much, much larger scale.  We all know people like the two jocks... and we can (and should) find ourselves reflecting on our own feelings about what befalls them... is it ""justice"" or is it morally wrong?  We all know, and in many cases have felt similarly to Ricky about, someone like his ""unrequited love"" and have seen how destructive such people can be in our lives, unless we learn to let go and see them for what they really are (a lesson which Ricky, unfortunately, never does learn in this film).This is a morality tale... a cautionary tale...  but it's not a ""fun"" movie nor ""entertaining"" in the conventional sense.  Go into it understanding that, and you can see the worth of this film.  Go into it expecting to be entertained...  to feel good afterwards and to not have to think or reflect... and you'll hate it.Fair warning.",5,"A deeply disturbing morality tale, far more relevant than

Deadgirl('09) obliterates all expectations while drilling deeper and deeper into the sexual subconscious.  It's an uncomfortable descent into the darkest abyss of human compassion.  It explores themes of guilt and temptation with a dark moral complexity while also balancing vulnerability with invincibility.  Bizarre, original, and totally morbid, this movie has cult status plastered all over it.Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) and J.T. (Noah Segan) are two high school buddies that seem to struggle fitting in with the ""cool kids"".  One day they both skip school to hangout and drink some beers at an abandoned insane asylum.  Eventually they stumble upon a presumably dead young woman who is chained naked to a table.  Things get even more crazy as they learn that something about her just doesn't feel quite....human?  Is she a vampire, zombie, or possibly something supernatural?  Questions go unanswered as J.T. contemplates other uses for this exposed, beautiful woman.This is the kind of American horror film I love to see.  Forget all the lousy remakes or regurgitated popcorn nonsense.  How bout one that actually pushes the boundaries and explores new horrifying territory?  Deadgirl is directed by Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel and written by Trent Haaga.  There are solid acting performances from the cast, plus stellar character development.

1265506,A1FJ4WAOIDPEF4,B002EOVXB0,David J. Brown,"[5, 10]","Yes, I only knew what the horror circles had spouted about this film, mostly positive praise.  I really didn't know much about the plot.  The cover makes it seem as if you're going to go into another tired Japanese-inspired ghost story---YAAAAAWWWWN.  But in fact this is a zombie film.  Wait, that is really,really, REALLY PLAYED OUT at this time too---DOUBLE YAAAAWWWNNN.  Ah, but then there's the actual film Deadgirl.  Yes, it's a zombie film.  No, it has nothing to do with Japanese ghost stories and it's nothing like what Romero has ever attempted(though, in all fairness he has hinted at it in at least two of his immortal zombie films).  This is about teenage boys' sexual ids.  This is about something that teenage outcasts think about all the time as they struggle to get dates or have their first sexual experience.  Sex slaves.  This movie takes that teen fantasy and presents it literally and with horrible consequences.This film has teenaged characters doing major, awful, graphic acts of misogny--CONSTANTLY.  Even our main character, our defacto hero if you will, is not someone you particularly love.  He's the least slimy of the the male characters, but he's the most 'normal'.  He can at least acknowledge what is going on is wrong, even if he still doesn't end up doing the right thing.  But the writers and directors of this film don't just settle for that.  They illustrate in some detail where this kid comes from and why he makes the bad decisions he makes.  This is a film about the type of outcasts that the Columbine murderers were.  Outcasts even to themselves in the long run.Like I said, this is a zombie film.  But there's ony one zombie film, and even though I'm sort of spoiling it here, you don't really know it's a zombie film until the end of the second act.  You are really not sure what the hell is going on most the time and why.  I LOVE THAT!  I miss it so much in modern cinema.  Everything is so spelled out and telegraphed, it's nice to a see a film confident enough to just tell the story through the characters' eyes and not have some innocuous character show up to play Johnny The Explainer.  It's all organic and the performances let you inside the characters' heads enough to buy the situation.  Very good.Though, there is one plot contrivance involving a jock getting his come-upance, that was a bit sketchy for me.  It's a little forced, while being quite unexpected, but I didn't totally buy it.  And after the situation's details unfurl you feel that it was only there for plot details more then any organic reason.  But that's about it.  The acting is all top notch.  Yes, you'll read here on Amazon about how the acting isn't very good, but I've read reviews here where someone actually congratualated the acting in a Friday the 13th film.  Seriously.  Anyway, I've noticed that on Amazon when a viewer doesn't like someone's public image, they tout them a bad actor.  Also, if the actor isn't well known then they're a bad actor.  This is a no-frills horror film.  No names of any kind.  Really good cineamatography.  A really original and originally sick premise.  It will truly get to you in the end and that's something that I haven't been able to say about a horror film in a long while.I must warn women viewers, this film may disturb and upset you more then the men.  My girlfriend was shocked and appauled.  She had never been so emotionally punched by acts of male characters on film.  I told here to check out In The Company of Men(a brilliant film by playwrite Neil Lebute that corners the market on how horrible misogny can be).  The filmmakers are unflinching in how they show and have their male characters act in this film.  They don't sugar coat it.  Our main antagonist is not perfect.  He's real.  He makes bad decisions, but you understand why they were made.  He's not a hero.  He's a real person.  Finally, real humans showing up in horror again.  It's easy to say what you would or wouldn't do when watching a film and judging, but we all know there's no way you would ever be able to rightly telegraph what you would do in this situation, a totally unlikely and implausable situation that is made real by the filmmakers.  Liking a horrifying film that is actually trying to solicit disgust and horror from you, doesn't make you as bad as the characters.  Relax, people, and just keep telling yourself,""It's only a movie.""""It's only a movie.""""It's only a movie.""""It's only a movie......""Great film.  Original film.

Yes, the premise of two high school buds stumbling upon a still animate dead girl secured to a gurney in the basement of an abandoned insane asylum sets one up for boatloads of horror stuff. That she is without clothing begs for teen horror trash treatment. But that's nearly where it ends.This film takes a different approach in that it focuses on what happens due to the dead girl's discovery. The two chums are polar opposites. The one sees her as easy and available sex for as long as he wants, while the other (the more sensitive one) feels that approach is wrong whether she is dead or not. There lies the rub.Of course their ""secret"" leaks out little by little which further complicates matters, and all things must come to a head.This little gem was budgeted just well enough to further the story, with no more than was needed in the make-up department to get the point across. Though I didn't recognize any of the actors' names or faces, they all did stand-up jobs in their rolls. Some nifty twists and turns took place to keep the road cluttered even though one thinks they might see where the whole thing is going.I tried to relate all this to my wife without too many spoilers and she said it sounded trashy and I realized you really need to see it to get it.

I truly thought this was going to be brainless, sick, gory, run-of-the-mill entertainment when I'd bought my own copy a couple weeks back.  This IS an original story.  It has to be.  I didn't read any reviews nor did I hear anybody talk to me about it.  I just blindly bought it.  Glad I did too!  This is the kind of Horror story that can only be dreamt, or at least it plays out like a sad dream.  It almost seems as if a story like this couldn't be made up haha.  As though it really happened.  I know, that sounds crazy.  'DEADGIRL' never has a slow pace and always kept me glued to the TV wondering what happens next.  Call me slow but I didn't figure out the whole story until the very end.  At first, I thought this was going nowhere.  I thought that this film was going to be one of those that gives no answers.  Leaves you wondering.  Again, I'm always glad I'm wrong about my stern predictions when it comes to Horror.  I'm trying not to give any spoilers when writing this.  Your just going to have to see this amazing story!  Once I figured out its story, I automatically fell in love with it!  The soundtrack to 'DEADGIRL' fits perfectly!  Gives it that nice dreamy feel!  While listening to the music, I recognized one of the artist!  It so happens to be a lead singer that played in a band titled, 'Silver Scooter'.  I was lucky and the chance to go see them play in Dallas,Texas some years back.  Now that they've broken up, the lead singer has a solo project titled, 'Super XX Man', which again, can be heard playing during the film.  Such a shock for me to see such a small indie band belong to a soundtrack of a well-budgeted film.  Anyway, where was I?  Warning, the film does has its disturbing moments.  After all, it is a Horror film.  Its not loaded with splatter but just enough to get its point across.  I never expected this film to turn out to be such a romantically dark story.

1265525,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B002EOVXB0,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Right away we are introduced to some high school delinquent--Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez; from the upcoming reboot of The Evil Dead) and JT (Noah Segan; Cabin Fever 2).  Bored while skipping school, they trespass their way into an abandoned mental hospital, drink, smoke and vandalize; essentially earning themselves an unfortunate fate by any horror standard.  Wandering unadvisably deep into the unsafe building they make their way to a long rusted-shut room in the lower corridors in which they find ""a dead girl.""The dynamic between Rickie and JT is decently played.  Although besties at initial face value, this thin veil is quickly drawn when JT becomes violently possessive of their ""dead girl.""  Naked, gagged, restrained and wrapped in plastic on as gurney--oh, right, and in a room rusted-shut and years (if not decades) separated from the world--the girl shows indications of somehow being alive.  After some destitute acts, the moral bankruptcy of both boys gradually becomes apparent, even if Rickie maintains the slightly higher moral ground throughout the story.  Interestingly, we also learn that this girl seemingly can't die.As the mute ""dead girl,"" new-comer Scream Queen Jenny Spain produces some truly awkward, hauntingly pain-wracked, even quite disturbing (when not brilliantly menacing or unnerving) expressions.  We find everything from hatred and fear to utter pandemonium in her eyes.  On the down side, the film's supporting roles are weak, even unnecessary.  While many scenes take place at the boys' high school or home, this could have been presented much more effectively as an extended one-act since all of the significant character development occurs, or could occur, in the abandoned mental hospital.  However, the inclusion of the Joann character (Candice Accola; The Vampire Diaries) did fact make for some interesting scenes that could not have been established with a one-act.Given a circumstance that couldn't possibly occur, this film examines sadism and temptation to the extreme.  This serves as the most realistic approach to an undead movie I've ever seen, but includes psychological aspects that genuinely make a real film of it--even if presented with speaking parts that are heavily eclipsed by the story concept and the emotions of ""the dead girl.""  Really, this is a great (though very sick) idea delivered--because of the maturity of the main characters--immaturely with an appropriate but unsurprising ending.  But it is not without disturbing images, a new take on questioning moral limits, and an alternative take on the undead.  In that respect, this film was a unique success.  There was even some briefly satirical gross-out gore.This strangely transitions from serious, disturbed and depraved, to satirical.

It starts with a disgusting premise and then reaches nauseating depths of inappropriateness, offensiveness, and absurdly aggressive misogyny without ever actually becoming a scary movie. I am all for twisted movies, psychological terror, even blood and gore which is typical for zombie movies, but this one is just plain sick - but in a really clinically demented way, not in an intriguing dark zombie/horror movie way.The premise of the movie is neither clever nor scary - it is just plain disturbing -  going down a route one should never see another human being go - not even in jest for a movie: a couple of high school kids break into an abandoned mental institution and find a zombie girl they first brutally stab, beat and maim and then tie to a bed in the basement to regularly rape. Disturbing is great, especially in this genre, but not when accompanied by this much vile, unfounded violence and unspeakable acts of brutality. Of course the subdued message here is that rape and brutalizing are ok as long as they are being committed against ""lesser"" creatures or in this case, a zombie. The writers, apparently quite in tune with the level of depravity that they describe, seem to have missed that it is not whom the act is committed against that makes it unconscionable but the fact *that* it is committed in the first place.I have a high tolerance for terrifying and morally ambiguous movies of all kind but this one just went too far. Rape and forced captivity are simply unconscionable in the nature of most human beings that are capable of coherent thought, and said actions are generally not tolerated by most people in any society and any culture. Yet you have a series (not just one or two) of young adolescents commit acts so dark that calling them heinous would be stating it mildly. The horror elements are almost secondary in this case. They could have easily found a victim of head trauma in an abandoned house or a paraplegic or a mentally retarded individual and the movie wouldn't have changed much.I wonder why any studio or distributor would choose to endorse it. I really think the writers need to be taken in for psychological evaluation. This piece of garbage is not creative or art, it is the product of a pathological and twisted mind in need of some serious therapy and a partial lobotomy if you ask me.

These observations employ a darker and more relevant conviction here.The ideas at work in ""Deadgirl"" are so complex that calling this a ""horror film"" is perhaps not really accurate given the limitations by which the genre is judged. Admittedly, the film employs standard horror grammar, but by keeping an eye firmly fixed on economy and purpose, the directors avoid the pitfalls and cleverly make those limits work in their favor.For example, the girl in question, while an ""object"" in strictly horror terms, is carefully crafted to be something other than a person - she functions as a perfect cipher onto which alternative meanings can be projected. Unlike typical ""horror girls,"" she becomes as profoundly disturbing a concept as anything that contemporary horror has given us. She seems less an external creature than something within the characters. A fever dream of sexual, pathological-narcissism or trauma-porn-attachment made flesh. The context in which the story functions, an abandoned asylum is also rendered abstractly enough that one might read it equally as a metaphor or a place in the real world; an image of the rotting mind where deviance lurks - normally it's just a spooky ol' building when used in horrorThe characters enter such a bottomless pit in terms of real human behavior that whether intentional or not, a sense of allegory provides grounding for the audience, while grounding is desperately missing in the world these characters occupy.The film's male protagonists are are certainly of their time and they seem quite real to me. As with many kids today their sensitivities seem bleached away by what we all witness, a relentless, post-narrative media blast from earliest childhood and education without adequate social breadth. Their personal, familial inadequacies here seem to create a hunger for an effortless, narcissistic attachment. These are familiar kids. Placing them into this particular tale and intelligently imagining an outcome is what the directors have done. It is startling how effective it is.While ""Deadgirl""could easily have come across as a simply ghastly spectacle, the film transcends genre, as well as outflanking the need to simply entertain, shock or titillate.

There's not much to explain with the plot:  Two teenage boys find a zombie chained up in the boiler room of an abandoned mental facility and decide to ""keep it"".  Ricky, who is thinking rationally and wishes to report the find; and JT, who is thinking with his hormones and sees an opportunity that he can't pass up.  The two boys represent the two extremes found within any healthy teenage boy's psyche.  One extreme tells us to think of the moral impact and consequences of our raging pubescent sexuality.  The other extreme, that which is given by Mother Nature, urges boys of this age to have sex with just about anything that has the proper equipment.And that's what this movie is really about.  It's a reflection on our own primal urges to mate and to covet.  It's a sadistically honest look at what it's like growing into manhood trying to fit into an unforgiving social structure while every cell in your body is screaming, ""SEX!""It may seem unrealistic that two normal boys would resort to such defilement; but I guarantee you, every Friday night there is a party somewhere with teenage boys thinking one thing:  ""Let's get that girl drunk and have 'fun' with her.""So are you supposed to care about these boys? Not really.  But hopefully you'll watch this and understand what it was like as a teenager to feel unrequited love, and the overwhelming desire to feel in control of your life and those who have rejected you.Probably the most original zombie movie I've ever seen.~nico",5,Testosterone is a helluva drug.,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,1590,"['seeing', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'film', ""'m"", 'feeling', 'compelled', 'defend', 'little', 'not', 'much', 'explain', 'plot', 'Two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'find', 'zombie', 'chained', 'up', 'boiler', 'room', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'facility', 'decide', 'keep', 'Ricky', 'who', 'thinking', 'rationally', 'wishes', 'report', 'find', 'JT', 'who', 'thinking', 'hormones', 'opportunity', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'two', 'boys', 'represent', 'two', 'extremes', 'found', 'healthy', 'teenage', 'boy', 'psyche', 'One', 'extreme', 'think', 'moral', 'impact', 'consequences', 'raging', 'pubescent', 'sexuality', 'other', 'extreme', 'given', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'boys', 'age', 'have', 'sex', 'just', 'anything', 'proper', 'equipment.And', 'what', 'movie', 'really', 'about', 'reflection', 'own', 'primal', 'urges', 'mate', 'covet', 'sadistically', 'honest', 'look', 'what', 'growing', 'manhood', 'trying', 'fit', 'unforgiving', 'social', 'structure', 'cell', 'body', 'screaming', 'SEX', 'may', 'seem', 'unrealistic', 'two', 'normal', 'boys', 'would', 'resort', 'such', 'defilement', 'guarantee', 'Friday', 'night', 'party', 'somewhere', 'teenage', 'boys', 'thinking', 'one', 'thing', 'Let', 'get', 'girl', 'drunk', 'have', ""'fun"", 'So', 'are', 'supposed', 'care', 'boys', 'Not', 'really', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'teenager', 'feel', 'unrequited', 'love', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'feel', 'control', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'rejected', 'you.Probably', 'most', 'original', 'zombie', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen.~nico']",Deadgirl

Deadgirl has it moments where it's entertaining but for the most part I found myself waiting for the movie to hit it's stride.  I found the story to be unbelievable...granted, it's basically a zombie movie, it's still rediculous, even by zombie movie standards.  During the movie I found myself wondering if the director was aiming for horror or comedy because there is plenty of both throughout the entire thing.

1265541,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,B002EOVXB0,"Paul Aragon ""krakatoa1883""","[6, 9]","Deadgirl is a modest budgeted oddity that is held together almost entirely by its rather unwholesome premise. In a nutshell, you have these two highschool misfits who cut class one day, and mess around in the local neighborhood abandoned insane asylum. Every neighborhood has one of these I suppose. Rickie, the Wally Cleaver of this dynamic duo, is the lovesick loser down on his luck type. He's a sullen character who rarely smiles and is continually burdened by his pesky conscience. JT, our Eddie Haskell, has no conscience to speak of, and one quickly gets the feeling that a stiff breeze could push this character over the edge into total wickedness. Just like some kind of urban folklore legend, the pals encounter the dreaded black dog, symbolic in the old country of famine and death. Fleeing from this mongrel is of course what leads them to the real discovery in the basement. It is there that they find a beautiful naked woman lying on her back on a metal table, securely fascened to it by her wrists and ankles. Even more interestingly, she is also incased within a thick clear plastic bag. I think that the creators of this story must of seen the documentary on realistic female silicone love dolls used as substitutes for actual women, because this living dead girl looked like she was all packaged and ready for immediate shipping. It is here that our pals have their conflict. Good old Wally Cleaver wants to notify authorities immediately, and Eddie Haskell wants to keep this nude female zombie as his own personal blow up doll. So JT punches his sulking pal in the face, and Rickie leaves dejected.Though there are a few intriguing moments amoungst the none-zombie members of the cast, most of their behavior, and most of the drama for that matter, are blatantly stereotypical. For example, since JT is the bad egg in a film who's very premise is teetering on NC-17 anyway, his language is naturally peppered with F-Bombs. He also has to shoulder one of the biggest problems of the plot. The audience already knows that the dead girl is a zombie, but JT has to explain it to Rickie right in front of us anyway. In a vein attempt to comb over this tedious task, the story calls for JT to shoot the zombie in the belly. It comes across as an unnecessary empty gesture. Ultimately, all he did was damage the pristine condition of his sex toy to prove a point.Wheeler the Squealer.Then there is the whole thing with Johnny the jock. He is a chisiled jawed muscle bound jerk who's sole purpose for being in the film is for us to hate his guts. To help us hate him even more, he is also shown dating the girl that our long suffering protagonist Rickie is hopelessly in love with. Since Rickie can't keep his eyes off this girl, Johnny the Jock beat him and Rickie's annoying side kick Wheeler up in the school parking lot. The beating borders on attempted murder and is further confounded when Wheeler squeals about the existence of Deadgirl to Johnny. Johnny chooses to take Wheeler on face value, so he commits his second felony of the afternoon, right in front of student onlookers and bus drivers. He kidnaps Wheeler and Ricky by tossing them into the trunk of his car. Even Rickie's love interest is there to see these two crimes take place, but like everyone else who's watching, she does little to stop these felonies, and takes no action to inform the authorities. This whole sequence of events just doesn't work at all, but at least we get to see Johnny get his privates gnawed on by Deadgirl, and his intestines come out his hind parts in the school toilet. None of these events can withstand even the slightest penlight of logic, but it sure is a blast to watch Johnny's demise frame by frame by pressing the pause and fast forward buttons.Even though the outcome of this film has been foretold a million times over in a million different movies before it, there are still enough things that stand out to make Deadgirl worthwhile. JT is played brilliantly by Noah Segan who seemed to relish in that roll and fill it with a dominating demented presence. It was also a great technical choice to show the gradual yet rapid decay of Deadgirl herself. At first she was almost hot as she arched her back and stretched out her naked torso and ribcage in front of the letcherous eye of the leering camera, but by the end, you didn't want to go anywhere near her. Towards the end of the film, her skin seemed to glisten with the greenish oily residue of her dank crusty basement surroundings. The make up effects where very effective, not just with the blood and decay of Deadgirl, but also with the horrible looking wound she inflicted upon JT's face. It really did look like his upper palate had been eaten off. I also loved the sickly sinister idea JT had of replacing the rabidly decaying body of Deadgirl with some fresh new meat. Since Deadgirl was turning sour, his vile idea was to capture some young hot sweetie and have Deadgirl take a bite out of her. This would infect Deadgirls replacement into become his new and improved zombie sex slave. Of course even a total simpleton has to know that this means Rickie's love interest, but even that shouldn't matter. With a premise like the one in Deadgirl, it's the thought that counts.3.5 stars.Lessons learned from watching this feature:1) If you decide to own your own sex doll, keep it in a cleaner place then the grungy basement of an abandoned insane asylum.2) Keep the existence of your sex doll to yourself.3) Being rough with a zombie sex slave greatly enhances ones ability to eat corn on the cob.",4,Wally and Eddie find The Beaver.,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,5578,"['Deadgirl', 'modest', 'budgeted', 'oddity', 'held', 'together', 'almost', 'entirely', 'rather', 'unwholesome', 'premise',

1265542,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B002EOVXB0,Paulo Leite,"[28, 50]","I wanted to love this film since the premise behind it is near brilliant.Two teenage boys go vandalize an abandoned hospital and find a girl tied to a table. One of them decides to make her their private sex slave. The other does not. Then they discover she cannot die (even after one of them shoots her). So they keep her. One teen keeps using her while the other goes on to have conscience problems.But there are capital problems here that prevent such premise from blooming into a great one-of-a-kind film.The first thing that strikes me is the miscasting of 25y/o actors who look like 25y/o men and trying to make me believe they are 17y/o teens. That is one major thing that makes this film look quite ridiculous. So you have some 25y/o men dressed as teens and behaving like teens. For me it is hard to buy. I'm sure there are lots of 17y/o teens who would make this film really disturbing.The second big problem here is the script. It is talky and talky and talky. I have nothing against talky scripts but here I kept asking myself ""won't this film advance to the next scene, please?"". Then I realized this film only had story for 40 minutes.

1265546,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002EOVXB0,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 7]","Deadgirl (Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel, 2008)For some odd reason, though I picked movies I wanted to watch at random over the past week, I started out with mediocre horror flicks, then went upwards in quality in a linear progression. While for obvious reason that makes me a very happy camper, it does make me limit my use of superlatives in reviews for movies that came in the middle of the streak. (Which probably makes you a very happy camper.) I was all set to go gaga over Carver for being the most blood-soaked fun I'd had in weeks. Then I saw Deadgirl, and it was even better. Then I saw Isolation, which is even better, though a thoroughly different kind of horror flick than the two that preceded it, so maybe I should just go back to superlatives and lavish the praise this movie so richly deserves upon it. Now, let me say that the part of me that was thrilled with Deadgirl is also the part that relentlessly devours Matthew Stokoe novels; this is a movie that sets out to do what horror movies have traditionally done (and stopped trying to do about the time they met with mass commercial success), push as many envelopes as possible. Shock and disgust viewers. Make them question, well, everything. And in that vein, Deadgirl is probably the most successful horror film since The Exorcist, though where Friedkin was honed in on religion, Sarmiento and Harel are looking more generically towards societal mores.Plot: a couple of high school stoners, Rickie (Cadillac Records' Shiloh Fernandez) and TJ (The Brothers Bloom's Noah Segan), cut school one day and, instead of smoking up in the parking lot, decide to utilize a nearby abandoned asylum. This leads to some rampant destruction of property, and then to some exploring. Much to their surprise, the two of them discover what seems to be a forgotten patient in a locked room in the basement. The thing is, the patient, who TJ quickly christens Deadgirl (Jenny Spain in her film debut), should have been dead long ago. TJ experiments, and finds out that she is, in fact, incapable of dying, much to Rickie's horror. Cue the Lord of the Flies vibe here, as the former best friends square off. TJ realizes that what he's got is, essentially, a living (well, undead) blow-up doll, while Rickie, who can't get past the fact that Deadgirl is, or once was, human, wants nothing more than to restore what little dignity she has left to her. When their secret gets out, things just get worse...Necrophilia, while a semi-popular theme in the music biz ever since Alice Cooper's ""I Love the Dead"", has never really taken hold in the film world outside a very, very small fringe of hardcore freaks (viz. Cerda's Aftermath or Buttgereit's NekRomantik films). When it's part of a film in prudish North America, it's always alluded to, or stylized, or only allowed to happen in clean, sterile conditions with beautiful, undecomposed corpses. (Not, mind you, that this makes me love Kissed any less than I do.) Well, folks, throw that notion away, because Deadgirl comes complete with all the dirt, stench, and decay you could possibly want, and then some. From the prurient-interest standpoint, this has it all, and then some. But (and I'm sure this will surprise some of my regular readers) that's not what impressed me here. (Okay, not all of it.) The real joy of Deadgirl comes from the quartet of lead actors--Fernandez, Segan, Juno's Candice Accola as Rickie's childhood crush, and Paradise Hills' Eric Podnar as TJ and Rickie's third stoner buddy. All four turn in performances way, way above average for a microbudget movie like this. (And Spain's wordless performance is about as powerful as it can be, given that she spends the entire movie unclothed, and most of it restrained.) I have said many, many times that much of the reason scary movies are scary is that we can get inside the heads of the characters and empathize with one or more of them, and never has that been more true than it is here. I'm not sure ""scary"" is the proper term for Deadgirl, though. Aside from the zombie-girl angle, there's not much in the way of horror elements in this film. It's high school angst drama done exceptionally well a la River's Edge (a movie it echoes more than once, which I'm sure isn't a coincidence).Not to say the movie doesn't have its faults. There are a couple of back-to-back scenes about two-thirds of the way through the film where the movie's humor (which has to this point been black, black, black) is played straight, and they ring false. Some of the acting done by minor characters in the film is downright awful. It's not a perfect film by any means. (But the ending, which some are saying is the movie's biggest flaw, I see as a strength, if for no other reason than because it's getting people arguing about the movie in a way an unambiguous, less offensive ending wouldn't have. And I'm on the side of saying ""yes, I do see how it fits,"" though I can't say more than that without major spoilers.) It is, however, a very strong one. I keep thinking about nudging the rating up half a star and not doing so because of the silly comedy scenes, but it still may happen in the future. This is a good one indeed. *** ",4,I thought Americans had forgotten how to make movies like this.,1259539200,"11 30, 2009",2009,5191,"['Deadgirl', 'Marcel', 'Sarmiento', 'Gadi', 'Harel', '2008',

1265553,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002EOVXB0,Stuart Conover,"[2, 3]","Deadgirl was a horror film that came out in 2008 that pretty much fell under the radar, and thats a shame since it's creepy as hell. The film was directed by Marcel Sarmiento and Gadi Harel who both had a couple films under their belts and came up with a masterpiece with this one. (They are also currently in the works on a movie called Murk.) It was written though by Trent Haaga who not only written a few movies but has acted in quite a few as well.The film opens with two best friends (who happen to be quickly shown as the unpopular kids) deciding to skip class. These two, J.T. (Noah Segan) and Rickie (Shiloh Fernandez) end up going to a mental asylum to explore and when they are getting ready to leave stumble across the dead body of a woman. She is strapped to the bed, naked, and suddenly opens her eyes. Dead isn't the exact word for what she is after all though living doesn't describe it either.While Rickie wants to let the girl go, J.T. talks him into keeping her tied down. Accidentally it's found out that she cannot die though clearly does not have enough intelligence to communicate with them as she acts more like a wild animal than anything else. While they both agree to keep the secret of what they have, and Rickie doesn't say anything, it is clear that a few other people end up finding out about the dead girl. As J.T. has been talking to others about what he has a few others have been paying him to get a piece of her as well.This is where we mix in the fact that Rickie has a girl that he is in love with. While he is trying to woo the woman he loves we flash to seeing J.T. ever increasing what he does with his undead captive. J.T. clearly has more issues than originally thought as he starts to mix violence with sex and keeps pushing the boundaries wondering what he can get away with. As their opinions on women divide them even further between each other it leads to a climax of the film that is unfortunately predictable. While the ending is actually filmed extremely well it was hard to not see it coming from a mile away.While the premise is clearly something to creep anyone out (multiple guys deciding to have sex with an undead girl) the film tries to mix humor with the horror. When it comes to trying to tackle a subject of tackling raping the undead, a coming of age story, a teen romance, and a sex comedy? It just doesn't work. The premise if it stuck to just the horror aspect may have been too much for more audiences but would have kept the film from being lowered into something that wasn't fully enjoyable for a failed mixing of genres instead of going ""too far. Deadgirl had a lot of potential with a plot that could have pushed the limits of what we feel comfortable watching but instead turned what should have been a graphically and mentally twisted film into something that, while graphic, fell short. It's hard for me to decide how I feel on this one as I loved the actual premise but felt the side-plots ruined the film.",4,Morbid in that way you love to be creeped out by,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,2980,"['Deadgirl', 'was', 'horror', 'film', 'came', 'out', '2008', 'pretty', 'much', 'fell', 'radar', 'shame', 'creepy', 'hell', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Marcel', 'Sarmiento', 'Gadi', 'Harel', 'who', 'had', 'couple', 'films', 'belts', 'came', 'up', 'masterpiece', 'one', 'are', 'also', 'currently', 'works', 'movie', 'called', 'Murk', 'was', 'written', 'Trent', 'Haaga', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'written', 'few', 'movies', 'acted', 'quite', 'few', 'well.The', 'film', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'happen', 'be', 'quickly', 'shown', 'unpopular', 'kids', 'deciding', 'skip', 'class', 'two', 'J.T', 'Noah', 'Segan', 'Rickie', 'Shiloh', 'Fernandez', 'end', 'up', 'going', 'mental', 'asylum', 'explore', 'when', 'are', 'getting', 'ready', 'leave', 'stumble', 'dead', 'body', 'woman', 'strapped', 'bed', 'naked', 'suddenly', 'eyes', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'exact', 'word', 'what', 'living', ""n't"", 'describe', 'either.While', 'Rickie', 'let', 'girl', 'go', 'J.T', 'talks', 'keeping', 'tied', 'down', 'Accidentally', 'found', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'die', 'clearly', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'intelligence', 'communicate', 'more', 'wild', 'animal', 'anything', 'else', 'agree', 'keep', 'secret', 'what', 'have', 'Rickie', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'clear', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'end', 'up', 'finding', 'out', 'dead', 'girl', 'J.T', 'been', 'talking', 'others', 'what', 'few', 'others', 'have', 'been', 'paying', 'get', 'piece', 'well.This', 'where', 'mix', 'fact', 'Rickie', 'girl', 'love', 'trying', 'woo', 'woman', 'flash', 'seeing', 'J.T', 'ever', 'increasing', 'what', 'undead', 'captive', 'J.T', 'clearly', 'more', 'issues', 'originally', 'thought', 'mix', 'violence', 'sex', 'pushing', 'boundaries', 'wondering', 'what', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'opinions', 'women', 'divide', 'even', 'further', 'other', 'climax', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'predictable', 'ending', 'actually', 'filmed', 'extremely', 'well', 'was', 'hard', 'not', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'premise', 'clearly', 'something', 'creep', 'anyone', 'multiple', 'guys', 'deciding', 'have', 'sex', 'undead', 'girl', 'film', 'tries', 'mix', 'humor', 'horror', 'When', 'trying', 'tackle', 'subject', 'tackling', 'raping', 'undead', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'teen', 'romance', 'sex', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'premise', 'stuck', 'just', 'horror', 'aspect', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'kept', 'film', 'being', 'lowered', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'fully', 'enjoyable', 'failed', 'mixing', 'genres', 'instead', 'going', 'too', 'far', 'Deadgirl', 'had', 'lot', 'potential', 'plot', 'could', 'have', 'pushed', 'limits', 'what', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'instead', 'turned', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'graphically', 'mentally', 'twisted', 'film', 'something', 'graphic', 'fell', 'short', 'hard', 'decide', 'how', 'feel', 'one', 'loved', 'actual', 'premise', 'felt', 'side-plots', 'ruined', 'film']",Deadgirl

There is even a great story in DEADGIRL...but they made the movie before it was ready.The intriguing idea is two dopey teens poking around an abandoned mental hospital discover a naked girl chained down to a table who isn't alive.  But she's not exactly dead either.  But she's hot, for a zombie.  And naked.  You can see the possibilities coming but the film doesn't decided whether it's a horror film or a comic horror film.In fact, the script doesn't make a lot of decisions that help with the great idea.  Why couldn't the more thoughtful teen dig through the lab to find out who the girl was and how she ended up chained to a table?  The writers indulged the scumbag teen who uses the deadgirl for his own gratification but left the other teen thinly developed and weak.I admire the filmmakers for independently creating a vision...but the vision wasn't prepped enough to become a professional horror film.  Characters aren't developed, ideas aren't followed through, good ideas are thrown in but then left incomplete.Better than most of the ""horror"" crap I've seen (certainly more interesting than more popularly-distributed films like HOSTEL or whatever torture porn is hitting the multi-plexes) but...just not there yet.",2,Just Not There Yet,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1264,"['great', 'idea', 'DEADGIRL', 'even', 'great', 'story', 'DEADGIRL', 'made', 'movie', 'was', 'ready.The', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'two', 'dopey', 'teens', 'poking', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'hospital', 'discover', 'naked', 'girl', 'chained', 'down', 'table', 'who', ""n't"", 'alive', 'not', 'exactly', 'dead', 'either', 'hot', 'zombie', 'naked', 'can', 'see', 'possibilities', 'coming', 'film', ""n't"", 'decided', 'horror', 'film', 'comic', 'horror', 'film.In', 'fact', 'script', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'decisions', 'help', 'great', 'idea', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'more', 'thoughtful', 'teen', 'dig', 'lab', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'girl', 'was', 'how', 'ended', 'up', 'chained', 'table', 'writers', 'indulged', 'scumbag', 'teen', 'who', 'deadgirl', 'own', 'gratification', 'left', 'other', 'teen', 'thinly', 'developed', 'weak.I', 'admire', 'filmmakers', 'independently', 'creating', 'vision', 'vision', 'was', ""n't"", 'prepped', 'enough', 'become', 'professional', 'horror', 'film', 'Characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'ideas', 'are', ""n't"", 'followed', 'good', 'ideas', 'are', 'thrown', 'then', 'left', 'incomplete.Better', 'most', 'horror', 'crap', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'certainly', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'popularly-distributed', 'films', 'HOSTEL', 'torture', 'porn', 'hitting', 'multi-plexes', 'just', 'not', 'there', 'yet']",Deadgirl

1265556,A373R1CJT7JEKT,B002EOVXB0,titania86,"[85, 103]","Misfits Rickie and JT decide to skip school and drink beer in an abandoned insane asylum. After taking out their teen angst on the place, they incur the wrath of a guard dog. They narrowly escape it deep in the bowels of the building and find a room that's been sealed for a long time. In that room, they find something that will change their lives forever: a dead girl tied to a gurney and wrapped in plastic. They soon find out that she is alive, but extremely savage and seemingly immortal. JT wants to take advantage of having a nude, helpless female lying around, while Rickie feels quite the opposite. When word gets around and more people get involved, Rickie and JT embark in a power struggle that spins out of control and leads to an unexpected and dark resolution.I just want to start by saying this is a very polarizing film: you'll either love it or despise it. The film as a whole is hard to watch because of the nonchalance the characters have with their own horrific actions. It's really chilling how calmly JT describes how he raped, beat, and attempted to kill the woman multiple times. He seems to think that it's ok because he sees her as being less than an animal. Zombies are usually the monsters in works of fiction, but in this case, it's the teenage boys that are infinitely more monstrous. Human nature can be an ugly and savage thing when out of the gaze of society.These boys have discovered a world where they are the supreme rulers. They don't have to follow the rules or accept that they are pathetic losers who will contribute nothing to the real world. In this world, they always get the girl and call the shots. It's the ultimate fantasy for them. Their world is completely removed from reality, in a dark, dank basement that is the polar opposite of reality in almost every way. I hate the characters. They are pathetic excuses for human beings, but I can see where they come from: a place where no one cares what happens to them and where they have no future. It's a great character piece where I don't agree at all with them and I think they are horrible and stupid, but understand them just the same. That's the mark of great story telling.Rickie is the only male character with any sort of promise. The others are satisfied to get sexual gratification from a mute, unaware woman than have a real, healthy, consensual relationship. Rickie still isn't completely innocent because he knows that what his friends are doing is wrong, but he hesitates to do something about it. He seems to be torn between resigning himself to the emotionless situation with the dead girl or attempting to make a real human connection with a living, breathing classmate. This film is kind of a sick and twisted coming of age story.The woman being used and raped in this film is a zombie. This fact doesn't make her any less of a victim. Society in general objectifies women in the advertising and the media all the time. Women are frequently equated to objects or animals and shown as inherently inferior to men. Sometimes I find myself desensitized against such advertising because it's so pervasive and we as a society see literally thousands of advertisements each day. This general environment can make it easy for some to internalize this sexist thinking and go even further to say that anything can justifiably be done to them. The woman's rapists distance themselves from her by thinking of her as less than them, less than human. This film holds up a mirror to our society and makes us see the ugliness within it.This is a powerful and uncomfortable film to watch. It's well produced, written, and acted. Jean Spain gives a wonderful performance as the Deadgirl and manages to make her both sympathetic and dangerous without even speaking.

Yes, taking advantage of chained-up zombie women is appalling, but so is chopping people to bits with an axe.  Also, sure, the characters did some things that made no sense. To that I ask did it make sense when Mary Poppins flew around using an umbrella?  Its a movie, take it for what it is and roll with it.  When someone throws this one into the player they should not be expecting a monkey playing basketball, it is what it is.Things I liked - the way it was shot, the soundtrack, most of the characters and their brooding countenances or creepy vibes. I liked the setting and even the general plotline. While I raised a brow at the main crux of the tale - the treatment of the ""Deadgirl""  I went with it and enjoyed the movie. I also looked past some of the unrealistic ways these kids were acting, but then again read the paper daily and you will see there are a lot of kids acting off-kilter.  Best thing for me is by the last 10 minutes i was rooting for a particular curtain close on this one, and it ended basically how I had hoped, with a bit more of an artistic touch to it. Job well done there.So yeah, this one is creepy and to some amoral, but again - all kinds of crazy things are going on in the slipcases of horror films. The movie is supposed to elicit a semblance of disgust along with suspense - its not like they tricked anyone into it, it pretty much tells you on the box or in this myriad of reviews.

For J.T. and his friend this means skipping school, thinking long and hard about the ""where"" that comes with drinking, and then deciding on an abandoned mental institution. At first this amounts to the destruction of property and demystifying the premises, but the afterward finds them exploring a little place called ""the tunnel."" In the tunnel the two find many things, but the most intriguing of all is a girl that is bound in chains and seemingly abandoned, all alone but still alive. Things get odder after one of the boys stays with her and decides to take out all his anger on her, breaking her neck in the process. The only problem is that this does not kill her - on the contrary, it starts a landslide that leaves everyone wondering where she came from, what she is doing here, and why she will not die.While Dead Girl starts out slow and leaves a lot of questions unanswered, it does answer one key thing that makes me think that we all know the answers to what she is. When we first see the girl, she seems harmless enough. By the time some answers pour in and this faade is pulled away, however, she seems less like someone that was tormented and more like someone that you would chain in a basement because of a really good reason. That makes her scary and understandable at the same time, explaining how she was put into an institution and why she would be left behind, and it says a lot about the effort she put into making a character with no speeches or threats into something that changes its proverbial face. The actors do a good job of selling certain things about their characters as all of this is happening, too, making the movie one that is frightening and engaging all at the same time. The plot takes a few twists and turns as well, and the ending is one of those that really stayed with me.Dead Girl has a lot of stuff in it that the movie does not discuss - it has nudity and violence and a lot of very disturbing notions. For this reason, some people may be turned off by the movie. Others may like the movie simply because the portrayal of the people is a real one in a lot of ways, showing the dark side of people and even the ugly side of caring. Personally, I liked it - even the slow parts - knowing how it all fit together. If you like a dark movie and have some time to check it out, I would say that it may be worth your time. Just don't let the editorial review or the cover review of the movie throw you - this is not a coming-of-age movie or some walk in the after-dark park.If you can abide by that, then you should find yourself watching something you could really find interesting.",4,Can we ever really know our friends?,1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,2702,"['Being', 'teenager', 'being', 'bored', 'two', 'things', 'seem', 'go', 'hand-in-hand', 'J.T', 'friend', 'skipping', 'school', 'thinking', 'long', 'hard', 'where', 'drinking', 'then', 'deciding', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'institution', 'first', 'destruction', 'property', 'demystifying', 'premises', 'afterward', 'exploring', 'little', 'place', 'called', 'tunnel', 'tunnel', 'two', 'find', 'many', 'things', 'most', 'intriguing', 'girl', 'bound', 'chains', 'seemingly', 'abandoned', 'alone', 'still', 'alive', 'Things', 'get', 'odder', 'one', 'boys', 'take', 'out', 'anger', 'breaking', 'neck', 'process', 'only', 'problem', 'not', 'kill', 'contrary', 'landslide', 'everyone', 'wondering', 'where', 'came', 'what', 'doing', 'here', 'why', 'will', 'not', 'die.While', 'Dead', 'Girl', 'out', 'slow', 'lot', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'answer', 'one', 'key', 'thing', 'think', 'know', 'answers', 'what', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'girl', 'harmless', 'enough', 'time', 'answers', 'pour', 'faade', 'pulled', 'away', 'however', 'less', 'someone', 'was', 'tormented', 'more', 'someone', 'would', 'chain', 'basement', 'really', 'good', 'reason', 'scary', 'understandable', 'same', 'time', 'explaining', 'how', 'was', 'put', 'institution', 'why', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'lot', 'effort', 'put', 'making', 'character', 'speeches', 'threats', 'something', 'proverbial', 'face', 'actors', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'selling', 'certain', 'things', 'characters', 'happening', 'too', 'making', 'movie', 'one', 'frightening', 'engaging', 'same', 'time', 'plot', 'few', 'twists', 'as', 'well', 'ending', 'one', 'really', 'stayed', 'me.Dead', 'Girl', 'lot', 'stuff', 'movie', 'not', 'discuss', 'nudity', 'violence', 'lot', 'very', 'disturbing', 'notions', 'reason', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'Others', 'may', 'like', 'movie', 'simply', 'portrayal', 'people', 'real', 'one', 'lot', 'ways', 'showing', 'dark', 'side', 'people', 'even', 'ugly', 'side', 'caring', 'Personally', 'liked', 'even', 'slow', 'parts', 'knowing', 'how', 'fit', 'together', 'like', 'dark', 'movie', 'have', 'time', 'check', 'out', 'would', 'say', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'editorial', 'review', 'cover', 'review', 'movie', 'throw', 'not', 'coming-of-age', 'movie', 'walk', 'after-dark', 'park.If', 'can', 'abide', 'then', 'should', 'find', 'watching', 'something', 'could', 'really', 'find', 'interesting']",Deadgirl

The dead girl is more like the living dead and has the ability to infect others with a bite.  This is why she is chained to a table in the basement of a long abandoned mental hospital.  How she came to be is not explained; that is part of the mystery.Spoilers.....Two teenage boys discover her, and one decides she will be his sex slave. She is also impervious to bullets and other things that would kill a normal person.  The other boy does not want to treat her that way. But loose lips allow others to become involved, and eventually a girl from their high school is abducted and taken to the basement as well.  I do not want to spoil the ending, but it does leave one wondering if the more principled boy has compromised his principles after all.The dialogue could have been better; I consider it intellectually lazy to drop F-bombs in every sentence.The mood and music are very eerie and appropriate.",3,"Dark, disturbing and unsettling",1289347200,"11 10, 2010",2010,1011,"['others', 'here', 'have', 'noted', 'film', 'very', 'disturbing', 'not', 'everyone', 'even', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'dead', 'girl', 'more', 'living', 'dead', 'ability', 'infect', 'others', 'bite', 'why', 'chained', 'table', 'basement', 'long', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'hospital', 'How', 'came', 'be', 'not', 'explained', 'part', 'mystery.Spoilers', '..Two', 'teenage', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'sex', 'slave', 'also', 'impervious', 'bullets', 'other', 'things', 'would', 'kill', 'normal', 'person', 'other', 'boy', 'not', 'want', 'treat', 'way', 'loose', 'lips', 'allow', 'others', 'become', 'involved', 'eventually', 'girl', 'high', 'school', 'abducted', 'taken', 'basement', 'as', 'well', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'leave', 'one', 'wondering', 'more', 'principled', 'boy', 'compromised', 'principles', 'all.The', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'consider', 'intellectually', 'drop', 'F-bombs', 'sentence.The', 'mood', 'music', 'are', 'very', 'eerie', 'appropriate']",Deadgirl

Trying to go in with more of an open mind the second time through, I was able to appreciate how horrific it really is. Rickie and JT are twentysomething high school students (uh, with a BMX bike - See, they're in high school!). Complete degenerates. Guess I had to accept that, too. Anyway, one day while ditching class, smoking, drinking, and vandalizing, they discover a ""deadgirl,"" essentially a zombie, in an abandoned mental hospital. JT develops an unhealthy obsession with her. Yep, there's corpse-screwing. He lets his buddy Wheeler get in on some of the action. They even peer pressure/trick the jock into having his way with her.

1265563,A16Q1LYIDE2WDZ,B002EOVXB0,Zoe Paris,"[1, 3]","If you have low expectations this isn't bad for a cheesy horror flick. It is gory and I wouldn't call it scary but it IS very creepy, gross and disturbing. The movie is about two teenage boys who skip school and go drinking...in a creepy, abandoned mental hospital! In a hidden room they find a chained up, naked ""dead"" girl, only the girl isn't actually dead. She is some kind of zombie that apparantly likes to bite people. She can't talk but she can moan and scream.For whatever reason, one of the guys decides it is a good idea to sleep with her...and beat her and basically abuse her...As you can probably guess, things don't end well for him. Soon, he finds out that bad things happen to the people she bites. The ending was predictable but witty. I DO however have one big complaint with the movie: We never find out WHAT the dead girl is! Is she a zombie? Is she some evil demon? Is she a vampire? Does she have some crazy disease? Also, how did she get there? They never fully explain this stuff and they don't partially explain it either. Another complaint I have: The acting is decent but a few of the actors look WAY too old to be playing high school kids!All in all, if you are into cheesy horror this is a decent movie. It could have been scarier and it could have explained more. The good points are the gore and the general creepiness. It also might be a good one for fans of bondage etc. It also manages to do this without really being offensive. The actress is pretty but she is playing a dead zombie-thing, she is covered in nasty body makeup and she doesn't really react to pain or appear to suffer...she just lays there with a blank zombie-gaze and gnashes her teeth every once in a while. I would have liked to see her kick more butt in the movie though. Anyway, this movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I was entertained but probably not entertained enough to watch this again. I give it a three star rating because it did have good gore AND it actually had decent acting for a horror flick.",3,2 words=Low expectations!,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,2023,"['have', 'low', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'bad', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'flick', 'gory', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'scary', 'very', 'creepy', 'gross', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'skip', 'school', 'go', 'drinking', 'creepy', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'hospital', 'hidden', 'room', 'find', 'chained', 'up', 'naked', 'dead', 'girl', 'only', 'girl', ""n't"", 'actually', 'dead', 'kind', 'zombie', 'apparantly', 'bite', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'talk', 'can', 'moan', 'scream.For', 'reason', 'one', 'guys', 'good', 'idea', 'sleep', 'beat', 'basically', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'Soon', 'out', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'people', 'ending', 'was', 'predictable', 'witty', 'DO', 'however', 'have', 'one', 'big', 'complaint', 'movie', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'WHAT', 'dead', 'girl', 'zombie', 'evil', 'demon', 'vampire', 'have', 'crazy', 'disease', 'Also', 'how', 'did', 'get', 'there', 'never', 'fully', 'explain', 'stuff', 'do', ""n't"", 'partially', 'explain', 'complaint', 'have', 'acting', 'decent', 'few', 'actors', 'look', 'WAY', 'too', 'old', 'be', 'playing', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'are', 'cheesy', 'horror', 'decent', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'scarier', 'could', 'have', 'explained', 'more', 'good', 'points', 'are', 'gore', 'general', 'creepiness', 'also', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'fans', 'bondage', 'etc', 'also', 'do', 'really', 'being', 'offensive', 'actress', 'pretty', 'playing', 'dead', 'zombie-thing', 'covered', 'nasty', 'body', 'makeup', ""n't"", 'really', 'react', 'pain', 'appear', 'suffer', 'just', 'blank', 'zombie-gaze', 'teeth', 'once', 'while', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'kick', 'more', 'butt', 'movie', 'Anyway', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'was', 'entertained', 'probably', 'not', 'entertained', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'give', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'did', 'have', 'good', 'gore', 'actually', 'had', 'decent', 'acting', 'horror', 'flick']",Deadgirl
