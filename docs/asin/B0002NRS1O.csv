This is awful by even Filmation Animation standards-- this makes He-Man look like Shakespeare by comparison.The voice acting is inept, over the top and badly performed-- but the actors are working with scripts written by eleven year olds so they aren't entirely at fault.  The animation is horrendous, a character walking shouldn't be hard to do but here every character looks like they're either working as a pimp on seventh avenue or suffering some dibilitating muscle disease and struggling through physical therapy to walk again.There is great animation on TV before and after this-- as I said by comparison He-Man is better.  But if you want action cartoons with intelligent writing and competent animation that makes characters not look laughable try the original Johnny Quest or any of the variations of Batman the Animated Series (JLA, Superman, etc).

841593,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B0002NRS1O,DVD Verdict,"[5, 17]","Judge Patrick Bromley, DVD Verdict-- If Conan the Adventurer had actually aired in the early or mid-1980s, I might actually have some fondness for it. Instead, it ran in the early '90s when I had moved on past cartoons and onto much more mature, sophisticated fare like Saved by the Bell. Since animated shows had become considerably more advanced by the time Conan debuted (the long-running X-Men: The Animated Series started the same year), it's difficult to even give the show credit for the things that it does well--namely, the serialized storytelling that carries through from episode to episode. That's most of what the show has to offer--well, that and the fact that it represents an honest attempt to do serious fantasy in animated form. Sure, it's goofy and often lame, but it comes by these qualities honestly. It means well.Conan the Adventurer: Season One arrives in a two-disc set courtesy of Shout! Factory, a studio that continually puts out hard-to-find, sometimes forgotten cult movies and TV shows. For fans of this particular animated series, I'm sure the DVD release is a godsend, since the rest of us either forgot about the show or never knew it existed in the first place. If you are a fan of the cartoon, you'll have to be happy with getting nothing but that in this DVD set; the 13 episodes that make up Season One are spread out over two discs without any bonus material or special features (something of a rarity for Shout! Factory, who often pack their releases with extra content). All the episodes are presented in their original full frame TV aspect ratio and look ok at best, ranging from faded and soft to sometimes resembling old VHS. Still, it's probably the best version of the show anyone's going to see, and if you're a fan it will have to do. The 2.0 stereo audio track does fine with the dialogue and that incessant theme song, which also plays over the disc menus. After two episodes, you'll be walking around the house singing ""Co-NAN!"" for the rest of the day. And you won't be happy about it.I really can't recommend Conan the Adventurer: Season One to anyone but the diehard fans who have lamented its cancellation since 1994. It's not particularly true to the character, the animation is crude and kind of lame and the stories aren't really compelling enough to hold anyone's interest. I respect that it remains true to its fantasy roots, but that alone does not make it worth watching-Full review at dvdverdict.com",3,Attempt to do serious fantasy in animated form,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",2011,2462,"['Judge', 'Patrick', 'Bromley', 'DVD', 'Verdict', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'had', 'actually', 'aired', 'early', 'mid-1980s', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'fondness', 'Instead', 'ran', 'early', 'when', 'had', 'moved', 'past', 'cartoons', 'onto', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'sophisticated', 'fare', 'Saved', 'Bell', 'animated', 'shows', 'had', 'become', 'considerably', 'more', 'advanced', 'time', 'Conan', 'debuted', 'long-running', 'X-Men', 'Animated', 'Series', 'started', 'same', 'year', 'difficult', 'even', 'give', 'show', 'credit', 'things', 'well', 'namely', 'serialized', 'storytelling', 'episode', 'episode', 'most', 'what', 'show', 'offer', 'well', 'fact', 'honest', 'attempt', 'do', 'serious', 'fantasy', 'animated', 'form', 'Sure', 'goofy', 'often', 'lame', 'qualities', 'honestly', 'Adventurer', 'Season', 'One', 'two-disc', 'set', 'courtesy', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'studio', 'continually', 'out', 'hard-to-find', 'sometimes', 'forgotten', 'cult', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'fans', 'particular', 'animated', 'series', ""'m"", 'sure', 'DVD', 'release', 'godsend', 'rest', 'forgot', 'show', 'never', 'knew', 'existed', 'first', 'place', 'are', 'fan', 'cartoon', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'happy', 'getting', 'nothing', 'DVD', 'set', '13', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'spread', 'out', 'two', 'discs', 'bonus', 'material', 'special', 'features', 'something', 'rarity', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'who', 'often', 'pack', 'releases', 'extra', 'content', 'episodes', 'are', 'presented', 'original', 'full', 'frame', 'TV', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'look', 'ok', 'best', 'ranging', 'faded', 'soft', 'sometimes', 'resembling', 'old', 'VHS', 'Still', 'probably', 'best', 'version', 'show', 'anyone', 'going', 'see', ""'re"", 'fan', 'will', 'have', 'do', '2.0', 'stereo', 'audio', 'track', 'fine', 'dialogue', 'incessant', 'theme', 'song', 'also', 'disc', 'menus', 'two', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'walking', 'house', 'singing', 'Co-NAN', 'rest', 'day', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'it.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'Season', 'One', 'anyone', 'diehard', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'lamented', 'cancellation', '1994', 'not', 'particularly', 'true', 'character', 'animation', 'crude', 'kind', 'lame', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'compelling', 'enough', 'hold', 'anyone', 'interest', 'respect', 'true', 'fantasy', 'roots', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'worth', 'watching-Full', 'review', 'dvdverdict.com']",N/A

Storm (Bayu), Andrew Craig (Volcar), Jeremy Kemp (Hissah Zul), a host of other characters including Mickey Rooney, beautiful women who were with him or against him, and even Red Sonja who graced his path for one mere episode.This series is about a boy who was captured after his family and village was destroyed by Hissah Zul. After years of serfdom (but not as a slave) he grew into a man of unnatural strength, courage and a fate of a man who is destined to become king of all Cimmeria. It was an age of magic and witchery, of life and a quick death, and a maniac who thought he was immortal and feared nothing and no one, until Conan escaped his clutches.On the way they encounter all manner of adventures, weird creatures, wizards and witches, people, and the evil wizard comes to an unsermonial death so that Conan can become King. Our adventurers find many new friends, love and death, stories to tell of creatures that defy the imagination, and of witches and warlocks who believe they are beyond the human realm because of the magic they spit forth from their talismans and wiccans.The thing I hate about these shows (as in science-fiction) they can't get their facts right. In the days of unrecorded history there would not be chain-mail or steel-plate armor, samurai swords, martial arts, modern day horse saddles, women running around in tights, and castles that look like they came out of the 15th century of King Arthur's England.These shows are so modern with a small flavor of ancient ingredient, and weapons so plastic or wood and so new, that it is hard to forget that we are watching choreograhed fights to the extreme. These are just my opinions, but I do not let them devalue my opinion of the overall quality of a show when I watch them. I accept them for what they are.Overall I enjoyed the series and was pleased I obtained it for my library, and would recommend that anyone interested in Conan or R.E. Howard to think about getting it for their own pleasure and library.I gave the series five stars as I enjoyed it immensely and hope a lot of people will also, and it comes in a beautiful box which sets it off and is a bonus.

The first season ran on Saturdays in syndication and then in the second season it ran daily. This is the first time Conan the Adventurer has appeared in the US on dvd, having had a few releases in Region 2 up to a season 1 release and a full series release in Region 4 broken up into many volumes.Conan ran in the ealy 90s and it's action packed and story driven. Each episode often runs into the next episode though there are quite a few stand alone episodes as well. The main goal for Conan is trying to undo the spell of living stone cast upon his family which takes him across many lands gaining many new allies/friends in his fight against Wrath-Amon and Set:the evil snake god.Conan is really an underrated cartoon from 1992-93, it is most similar to the great 80s series ""Dungeons and Dragons."" One of the best things about Conan the Adventurer is that is actually finished it's series story line which not many cartoons do, due to the fact that they are always looking to get picked up for another season. The end of the series was very thrilling and satisfying to say the least. Though there was an ending it still left the cartoon with different arcs to take and in fact there was a Spin-off series called "" Conan and the Young Warriors "" which had 13 episodes but got cancelled shortly after it had aired back on CBS on Saturday mornings.I think Conan would be most enjoyed to see it from start to finish episode 1 to 64. It is disappointing to see only a Season 1 Dvd release for now but with good sales I am told Shout Factory will release the rest, the next set could come out in 6 months and it could be broken up into two more sets to finish it off on dvd. I really hope people will support this dvd release because it's a great cartoon, the stories were well written, the story arcs were great, though it's not as savage as the original books it is a kids series at heart after all. And I think if the sales are super, we might just also get the spin-off series Conan and the Young Warriors later also. Spread the word on supporting this dvd release, they aren't many cartoons made like this these days.*UPDATE* POSTED ON AUGUST 5Th, 2011Here's a good but not great update, in the Shout Factory release calendar it says Conan the Adventurer will have another release in November, it's a Season 2 part 1 dvd release of just 13 episodes, well season 2 had 51 episodes so it seems like they are breaking this season into little pieces. Not good. They should just do two sets of 26 and 25 episodes to finish it off, but hey that's just my opinion.",5,Conan the adventurer has arrived on dvd finally!,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,2679,"['Conan', 'Adventurer', 'ran', '64', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'was', '13', 'episodes', 'rest', 'series', 'ran', '51', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'ran', 'Saturdays', 'syndication', 'then', 'second', 'season', 'ran', 'daily', 'first', 'time', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'appeared', 'US', 'dvd', 'having', 'had', 'few', 'releases', 'Region', '2', 'up', 'season', '1', 'release', 'full', 'series', 'release', 'Region', '4', 'broken', 'up', 'many', 'volumes.Conan', 'ran', 'ealy', '90s', 'action', 'packed', 'story', 'driven', 'episode', 'often', 'next', 'episode', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'stand', 'alone', 'as', 'well', 'main', 'goal', 'Conan', 'trying', 'undo', 'spell', 'living', 'stone', 'cast', 'family', 'many', 'lands', 'gaining', 'many', 'new', 'allies/friends', 'fight', 'Wrath-Amon', 'Set', 'evil', 'snake', 'god.Conan', 'really', 'underrated', 'cartoon', '1992-93', 'most', 'similar', 'great', '80s', 'series', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'actually', 'finished', 'series', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'many', 'cartoons', 'do', 'due', 'fact', 'are', 'always', 'looking', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'season', 'end', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'thrilling', 'satisfying', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'ending', 'still', 'left', 'cartoon', 'different', 'arcs', 'take', 'fact', 'was', 'Spin-off', 'series', 'called', 'Conan', 'Young', 'Warriors', 'had', '13', 'episodes', 'got', 'cancelled', 'shortly', 'had', 'aired', 'back', 'CBS', 'Saturday', 'mornings.I', 'think', 'Conan', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'see', 'start', 'finish', 'episode', '1', '64', 'disappointing', 'see', 'only', 'Season', '1', 'Dvd', 'release', 'now', 'good', 'sales', 'am', 'told', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'will', 'release', 'rest', 'next', 'set', 'could', 'come', 'out', '6', 'months', 'could', 'be', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'more', 'sets', 'finish', 'off', 'dvd', 'really', 'hope', 'people', 'will', 'support', 'dvd', 'release', 'great', 'cartoon', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'story', 'arcs', 'were', 'great', 'not', 'as', 'savage', 'original', 'books', 'kids', 'series', 'heart', 'think', 'sales', 'are', 'super', 'might', 'just', 'also', 'get', 'spin-off', 'series', 'Conan', 'Young', 'Warriors', 'later', 'also', 'Spread', 'word', 'supporting', 'dvd', 'release', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'cartoons', 'made', 'days', '*UPDATE*', 'POSTED', 'ON', 'AUGUST', '5Th', '2011Here', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'update', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'release', 'calendar', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'will', 'have', 'release', 'November', 'Season', '2', 'part', '1', 'dvd', 'release', 'just', '13', 'episodes', 'well', 'season', '2', 'had', '51', 'episodes', 'are', 'breaking', 'season', 'little', 'pieces', 'Not', 'good', 'should', 'just', 'do', 'two', 'sets', '26', '25', 'episodes', 'finish', 'off', 'just', 'opinion']",N/A

The series effects and acting are so reminiscent of these bygone 90's shows that while a little ludicrous is still enjoyable enough to watch,  and while the effects look a little to hammy if you keep in mind to expect this kind of thing(Ala Hercules/Xena) than the show will entertain you.  The main actor Conan know mostly because of his U.S. debut from the movie Gladiator has the muscles of Conan but can definitely brush on his acting skills more but again with the 90's shows like this it was basically expected from us.

It is a lot better written (and acted) than Hercules and has about the same amount of hot chicks in bikini outfits as Xena. If youre a Conan fan, this is a must - but a must with tongue in cheek.

841609,AZRJHR8KH5QCY,B0002NRS1O,"Vulture Girl ""Rid""","[12, 13]","Many of us who grew up in the 80s and 90s love our nostalgia, especially when it comes to cartoons. We grew up with the best cartoons ever produced. Now many of us(including myself) ask ourselves,""Where did all the good cartoons go?"" Thanks to Shout! Factory, we can experience one of the most underrated and often-forgotten action cartoon, Conan the Adventurer.Based on Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, Conan the Adventurer debuted in 1992. Like many other 90s action cartoons, Conan the Adventurer was successful and ran for 51 episodes. Although successful, Conan the Adventurer remains one of the most underrated action cartoons.Conan the Adventurer centers around Conan, a young barbarian and his friends Needle a baby phoenix, Zula a shaman, Jasmine a circus acrobat, Greywolf a wizard, Falkenar, a flying warrior and Snagg a wiking as they set out to find a cure to save Conan's family who have been petrified by the evil serpent wizard Wrath-Amon. Wrath-Amon himself is out to free his master Sett, a giant cobra demon who long ago was imprisoned by Conan's ancestors.Thanks to this, we can now witness this highly underrated cartoon and feel like we're in the 90s once again. Here are the episodes.1.The Night Of Fiery Tears-Conan, a young barbarian in Cimmeria, has his family turned to stone by the cruel warlord Wrath-Amon. Now the young warrior must go on a quest to break the curse on his family and end the tyranny of Wrath-Amon.2.Blood Brother-Conan along with his new friends Needle and Zula are enslaved by spies of Wrath-Amon. Now Conan must face the monster that cursed his family.3.Star of Shadizar-Conan and Zula journey to Shadizar to find the Star of Transmutation, a powerful magical jewel which might help Conan break the curse on his family. On the way they meet a mysterious circus performer named Jazmine who might help them on their quest.4.Conan the Gladiator-When Conan and Jezmine are given the news that Zula has been captured by cannibals and is presumed dead, Conan vows to find his Blood Brother.5.The Heart Of Rakkir-Wrath-Amon has discovered the location of the Heart of Rakkir which will give him the power over a sea monster. He finds out that only a person with Atlantean blood may acquire the jewel. Luckily for Conan, he is the descedent of the Atlanteans.6.Men Of Stone-When Wrath-Amon enslaves a village and turns their chief to stone, Conan goes to investigate the matter and learns the secret behind the curse, but will it cost him his friends?7.The Terrible Torrinon-Conan, Jasmine and Snag ride into a town shunned by locals as being ""cursed"". There, they see a woman being carried away by an evil wizard, feared as the Terrible Torrinon. The adventuring trio mount a rescue, only to find that they have been deceived by a clever ploy of the villagers. Unfortunately, Wrath-amon too has been deceived, and he arrives to challenge Torrinon to a sorcerer's duel.8.Greywolf Of Xanthus-Conan, Jezmine, and Zula journey to Xanthus, the ancient city of wizards, to look for a way to break the stone curse that Wrath-Amon placed on Conan's family. There, they meet and befriend a wizard named Greywolf.9.Shadow Walkers-Conan and Greywolf are in the city of Phenion. When they are attacked by a gang of ninjas. The ninjas then explain that they are the Silent Dragons and they need his help. Conan agrees and the ninjas offer to teach him how to be a ninja.10.The Claw Of Heaven-Conan and Greywolf hear of a tribe of Picts (primitives) whose shaman/tribal leader wields a staff with a piece of Star Metal forged in the shape of a claw upon it. This specially forged Star Metal amplifies magical power, so the duo must both persuade the Picts to give them the Claw and protect it from Mesmira and Skulkur.11.The Serpent Riders Of Sett-Conan, Jasmine and Snag are travelling through a forest when they come across a band of warriors led by a youth, the ruler of the local land who was recently ousted by Wrath-Amon and his Serpent Men. Wrath-Amon captures castle and a mystical tomb of the Serpent Riders of Set, seven mystical 'horsemen' who served Set eons ago and who can be resurrected. Conan and the others agree to help the youth regain his castle.12.Windfang's Eyrie-Windfang, Wrath-amon's number one general, kidnaps Jasmine and imprisons her in his lair. As Conan comes to her rescue the draconically deformed Windfang reveals his previous existence as a normal human to Jasmine.13.Seven Against Stygia-Wrath-Amon is about to complete a second pyramid and come much closer to free his master Set. Conan and Zula discover this and call on the rest of their comrades so they may prevent it from happening.",5,Conan the Adventurer,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",2011,4659,"['Many', 'who', 'grew', 'up', '80s', '90s', 'love', 'nostalgia', 'especially', 'when', 'cartoons', 'grew', 'up', 'best', 'cartoons', 'ever', 'produced', 'Now', 'many', 'including', 'ask', 'Where', 'did', 'good', 'cartoons', 'go', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'can', 'experience', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'often-forgotten', 'action', 'cartoon', 'Conan', 'Adventurer.Based', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Conan', 'Barbarian', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'debuted', '1992', 'many', 'other', '90s', 'action', 'cartoons', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'was', 'successful', 'ran', '51', 'episodes', 'successful', 'Conan', 'Adventurer', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'action', 'cartoons.Conan', 'Adventurer', 'centers', 'Conan', 'young', 'barbarian', 'friends', 'Needle', 'baby', 'phoenix', 'Zula', 'shaman', 'Jasmine', 'circus', 'acrobat', 'Greywolf', 'wizard', 'Falkenar', 'flying', 'warrior', 'Snagg', 'wiking', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'cure', 'save', 'Conan', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'petrified', 'evil', 'serpent', 'Wrath-Amon', 'Wrath-Amon', 'free', 'master', 'Sett', 'giant', 'cobra', 'demon', 'who', 'long', 'ago', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'Conan', 'ancestors.Thanks', 'can', 'now', 'witness', 'highly', 'underrated', 'cartoon', 'feel', ""'re"", '90s', 'once', 'again', 'Here', 'are', 'episodes.1.The', 'Night', 'Fiery', 'Tears-Conan', 'young', 'barbarian', 'Cimmeria', 'family', 'turned', 'stone', 'cruel', 'warlord', 'Wrath-Amon', 'Now', 'young', 'warrior', 'must', 'go', 'quest', 'break', 'curse', 'family', 'end', 'tyranny', 'Wrath-Amon.2.Blood', 'Brother-Conan', 'new', 'friends', 'Needle', 'Zula', 'are', 'enslaved', 'spies', 'Wrath-Amon', 'Now', 'Conan', 'must', 'face', 'monster', 'cursed', 'family.3.Star', 'Shadizar-Conan', 'Zula', 'journey', 'Shadizar', 'find', 'Star', 'Transmutation', 'powerful', 'magical', 'jewel', 'might', 'help', 'Conan', 'break', 'curse', 'family', 'way', 'meet', 'mysterious', 'circus', 'performer', 'named', 'Jazmine', 'who', 'might', 'help', 'quest.4.Conan', 'Gladiator-When', 'Conan', 'Jezmine', 'are', 'given', 'news', 'Zula', 'been', 'captured', 'cannibals', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Conan', 'find', 'Blood', 'Brother.5.The', 'Heart', 'Rakkir-Wrath-Amon', 'discovered', 'location', 'Heart', 'Rakkir', 'will', 'give', 'power', 'sea', 'monster', 'out', 'only', 'person', 'Atlantean', 'blood', 'may', 'acquire', 'jewel', 'Luckily', 'Conan', 'descedent', 'Atlanteans.6.Men', 'Stone-When', 'Wrath-Amon', 'village', 'chief', 'stone', 'Conan', 'investigate', 'matter', 'secret', 'curse', 'will', 'cost', 'friends', '7.The', 'Terrible', 'Torrinon-Conan', 'Jasmine', 'Snag', 'ride', 'town', 'shunned', 'locals', 'being', 'cursed', 'see', 'woman', 'being', 'carried', 'away', 'evil', 'wizard', 'feared', 'Terrible', 'Torrinon', 'adventuring', 'trio', 'mount', 'rescue', 'only', 'find', 'have', 'been', 'deceived', 'clever', 'ploy', 'villagers', 'Unfortunately', 'Wrath-amon', 'too', 'been', 'deceived', 'challenge', 'Torrinon', 'sorcerer', 'duel.8.Greywolf', 'Xanthus-Conan', 'Jezmine', 'Zula', 'journey', 'Xanthus', 'ancient', 'city', 'wizards', 'look', 'way', 'break', 'stone', 'curse', 'Wrath-Amon', 'placed', 'Conan', 'family', 'meet', 'befriend', 'wizard', 'named', 'Greywolf.9.Shadow', 'Walkers-Conan', 'Greywolf', 'are', 'city', 'Phenion', 'When', 'are', 'attacked', 'gang', 'ninjas', 'ninjas', 'then', 'explain', 'are', 'Silent', 'Dragons', 'need', 'help', 'Conan', 'agrees', 'ninjas', 'offer', 'teach', 'how', 'be', 'ninja.10.The', 'Claw', 'Heaven-Conan', 'Greywolf', 'hear', 'tribe', 'Picts', 'primitives', 'shaman/tribal', 'leader', 'staff', 'piece', 'Star', 'Metal', 'forged', 'shape', 'claw', 'specially', 'forged', 'Star', 'Metal', 'magical', 'power', 'duo', 'must', 'persuade', 'Picts', 'give', 'Claw', 'protect', 'Mesmira', 'Skulkur.11.The', 'Serpent', 'Riders', 'Sett-Conan', 'Jasmine', 'Snag', 'are', 'travelling', 'forest', 'when', 'come', 'band', 'warriors', 'led', 'youth', 'ruler', 'local', 'land', 'who', 'was', 'recently', 'ousted', 'Wrath-Amon', 'Serpent', 'Men', 'Wrath-Amon', 'captures', 'castle', 'mystical', 'tomb', 'Serpent', 'Riders', 'Set', 'seven', 'mystical', ""'horsemen"", 'who', 'served', 'Set', 'eons', 'ago', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'resurrected', 'Conan', 'others', 'agree', 'help', 'youth', 'regain', 'castle.12.Windfang', 'Eyrie-Windfang', 'Wrath-amon', 'number', 'one', 'general', 'kidnaps', 'Jasmine', 'imprisons', 'lair', 'Conan', 'rescue', 'draconically', 'deformed', 'Windfang', 'previous', 'existence', 'normal', 'human', 'Jasmine.13.Seven', 'Against', 'Stygia-Wrath-Amon', 'complete', 'second', 'pyramid', 'come', 'much', 'closer', 'free', 'master', 'Set', 'Conan', 'Zula', 'discover', 'call', 'rest', 'comrades', 'may', 'prevent', 'happening']",N/A
