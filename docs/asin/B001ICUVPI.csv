My son who is 24 months old is not a big talker but just after one viewing of the colors DVD he says blue (for the first time after many tries from us to have him say the word) and can identify purple, blue, and red. He likes to watch the Blues Clues videos and Leap Frog videos (also very good) but they do not keep his attention as long as these did. We also watched the numbers video in which he was very interested in as well. We put it on yesterday to entertain my 24 month old and another 48 month old while we did projects with the older children 7 and 9 in youth group.  To my surprise the 7 and 9 year olds got very involved with the video and watched them with the younger ones reinforcing the numbers to them instead of doing the project they had been so eager to do.  At the end of the day the 48 month old asked if we could count and do numbers next week too.  I would highly recommend these for any parent to add to their childs DVD collections.",5,Money well spent,1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,1017,"['videos', 'are', 'wonderful', 'learning', 'tool', 'children', 'son', 'who', '24', 'months', 'old', 'not', 'big', 'talker', 'just', 'one', 'viewing', 'colors', 'DVD', 'blue', 'first', 'time', 'many', 'tries', 'have', 'say', 'word', 'can', 'identify', 'purple', 'blue', 'red', 'watch', 'Blues', 'Clues', 'videos', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'videos', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'do', 'not', 'keep', 'attention', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'also', 'watched', 'numbers', 'video', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'as', 'well', 'put', 'yesterday', 'entertain', '24', 'month', 'old', '48', 'month', 'old', 'did', 'projects', 'older', 'children', '7', '9', 'youth', 'group', 'surprise', '7', '9', 'year', 'olds', 'got', 'very', 'involved', 'video', 'watched', 'younger', 'ones', 'reinforcing', 'numbers', 'instead', 'doing', 'project', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'eager', 'do', 'end', 'day', '48', 'month', 'old', 'asked', 'could', 'count', 'do', 'numbers', 'week', 'too', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'parent', 'add', 'childs', 'DVD', 'collections']",N/A

Although the repetion can be mind numbing to an adult, my 16 month old grandchild watched the Colors DVD with interest while sitting in her high chair during snack time. I did a quick review of the other DVDs in the set. Since it does say it is for ages 9 months and up, I do feel that this set will be a good learning tool, and is age appropriate. UPDATE; We have had this set for several weeks, and I have to admit that I have been pleased with how the material is presented. Right now we are covering the Colors and Shapes DVDS. I watch it with my granddaughter, and become very involved with her learning. It's important to ""test"" your child by asking them to bring you their ""purple bunny"", ""green cup"" etc to reinforce what they have learned. When the purple segment came on, my granddaughter grabbed her ""purple bunny"" and sat down and watched with great interest which shows me she is understanding the concept of colors.",3,Good Learning Tool,1245283200,"06 18, 2009",2009,985,"['just', 'received', 'DVD', 'set', '4', 'pack', 'Leap', 'Frog', 'repetion', 'can', 'be', 'mind', 'numbing', 'adult', '16', 'month', 'old', 'grandchild', 'watched', 'Colors', 'DVD', 'interest', 'sitting', 'high', 'chair', 'snack', 'time', 'did', 'quick', 'review', 'other', 'DVDs', 'set', 'say', 'ages', '9', 'months', 'up', 'do', 'feel', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'learning', 'tool', 'age', 'appropriate', 'UPDATE', 'have', 'had', 'set', 'several', 'weeks', 'have', 'admit', 'have', 'been', 'pleased', 'how', 'material', 'presented', 'Right', 'now', 'are', 'covering', 'Colors', 'Shapes', 'DVDS', 'watch', 'granddaughter', 'become', 'very', 'involved', 'learning', 'important', 'test', 'child', 'asking', 'bring', 'purple', 'bunny', 'green', 'cup', 'etc', 'reinforce', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'When', 'purple', 'segment', 'came', 'granddaughter', 'grabbed', 'purple', 'bunny', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'great', 'interest', 'understanding', 'concept', 'colors']",N/A

1203649,A2PHMUTKSOFKCF,B001ICUVPI,"Nova ""Nova""","[3, 5]","Well I was hesitant to buy these because of some of the reviews written by folks in the education field saying that this was not an educationally sound way to learn.  I am SOOOO glad I ordered it though, and have since ordered as gifts for friends who are pregnant a second time and will have two kids under two (hey, they need something to do while you're nursing right?). I got these when my son was 17 months old.  He already knew shapes so he never watched that one.  He has known upper and lower case letters since he was 20 months old. I used to put this on while I made dinner and repeat the letters and their phonetic sound shouting from the kitchen.  He has known his phonics since 21 months. He is now 26 months old and knows his phonics, upper and lower case letters, numbers 1-10, shapes, colors (colors were the last to come, around 25 months), and many of the sight words. He has even made some of the sight words by putting letters together from his Leapfrog Fridge Word Builder. He is attempting to sound words out and can now sing the alphabet start to finish. He has really taken a shine to letters so I am hoping this will transition well into reading.  Too bad there are no videos by this company teaching to read...but I think there is where the ""educationally sound""  part comes in.  These teach through repetition.  One can't simply memorize every word in the dictionary (I suppose only the sight words).  But for basics that everyone needs to memorize such as what the letter A looks like, I don't see why repetition is so bad. If you were to learn another language, wouldn't you learn their alphabet through memorization/repetition?  You wouldn't learn to read that way, but in order to read you'd first need the building blocks to sound out the words.  I believe that is what these videos give - the basic building blocks for future learning.  My son actually never liked Sesame Street (which I believe another reviewer referred to as educationally sound) until he had memorized his letters.  It was at that point that Murray playing the ""Whats on me that starts with (letter)"" game became really interesting.I think these videos are great, and have taught my son so much.  I only hope I can keep him on the fast track without the aid of more awesome videos. The best I can seem to find to teach him to read are some Hooked on Phonic products and the Leapfrog Singalong DVD set.",5,"I'm no teacher, just a parent who saw some awesome results",1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,2404,"['Well', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'reviews', 'written', 'folks', 'education', 'field', 'saying', 'was', 'not', 'educationally', 'sound', 'way', 'learn', 'am', 'SOOOO', 'glad', 'ordered', 'have', 'ordered', 'gifts', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'pregnant', 'second', 'time', 'will', 'have', 'two', 'kids', 'two', 'hey', 'need', 'something', 'do', ""'re"", 'nursing', 'right', 'got', 'when', 'son', 'was', '17', 'months', 'old', 'already', 'knew', 'shapes', 'so', 'never', 'watched', 'one', 'known', 'upper', 'lower', 'case', 'letters', 'was', '20', 'months', 'old', 'used', 'put', 'made', 'dinner', 'repeat', 'letters', 'phonetic', 'sound', 'shouting', 'kitchen', 'known', 'phonics', '21', 'months', 'now', '26', 'months', 'old', 'phonics', 'upper', 'lower', 'case', 'letters', 'numbers', '1-10', 'shapes', 'colors', 'colors', 'were', 'last', 'come', '25', 'months', 'many', 'sight', 'words', 'even', 'made', 'sight', 'words', 'putting', 'letters', 'together', 'Leapfrog', 'Fridge', 'Word', 'Builder', 'attempting', 'sound', 'words', 'out', 'can', 'now', 'sing', 'alphabet', 'start', 'finish', 'really', 'taken', 'shine', 'letters', 'so', 'am', 'hoping', 'will', 'transition', 'well', 'reading', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'videos', 'company', 'teaching', 'read', 'think', 'where', 'educationally', 'sound', 'part', 'teach', 'repetition', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'simply', 'memorize', 'word', 'dictionary', 'suppose', 'only', 'sight', 'words', 'basics', 'everyone', 'memorize', 'such', 'what', 'letter', 'A', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'repetition', 'so', 'bad', 'were', 'learn', 'language', 'would', ""n't"", 'learn', 'alphabet', 'memorization/repetition', 'would', ""n't"", 'learn', 'read', 'way', 'order', 'read', ""'d"", 'first', 'need', 'building', 'blocks', 'sound', 'out', 'words', 'believe', 'what', 'videos', 'give', 'basic', 'building', 'blocks', 'future', 'learning', 'son', 'actually', 'never', 'liked', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'believe', 'reviewer', 'referred', 'educationally', 'sound', 'had', 'memorized', 'letters', 'was', 'point', 'Murray', 'playing', 'Whats', 'letter', 'game', 'became', 'really', 'interesting.I', 'think', 'videos', 'are', 'great', 'have', 'taught', 'son', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'hope', 'can', 'keep', 'fast', 'track', 'aid', 'more', 'awesome', 'videos', 'best', 'can', 'seem', 'find', 'teach', 'read', 'are', 'Hooked', 'Phonic', 'products', 'Leapfrog', 'Singalong', 'DVD', 'set']",N/A
1203650,A1SMU2LDMEIBWJ,B001ICUVPI,P. Toche,"[2, 4]","Here in Hong Kong it's very normal for kids to learn to read early. English is merely a warm-up for the serious thing, Chinese. At nearly 2 and a half years of age, my son can count into the twenties and read and spell (but not write with a pen) all the words taught in the DVD. and it's nothing to do with us, he wouldn't listen to us -- he has learned everything from the preschool DVDs.He started with the numbers at 1, shapes at 14 months, colors at 18 months, sight words at 24 months, which is where he's at now. We actually started showing him the colors when he was about 10 months but he was not particularly impressed and much preferred Noddy in toyland. We insisted for a few weeks and then gave up. All his playground mates knew colors, he didn't, but we didn't want him to enter the rat race and figured he'd pick it up eventually, as after all we had. One day he got us to play ""meet the numbers"", which we hadn't planned to show him since he still didn't know his colors, but that's what he liked and he learned the numbers in a week or so. From then on his learning has gone almost uninterrupted (interruptions included Noddy, Mickey, Pingu, Shaun the sheep). Because he started the numbers quite early he actually spent quite a bit of time on that DVD, whereas the colors were digested in about one month, once he was ready for it.Timing will greatly affect your kid's experience. I'd suggest guiding your child and letting your child decide too, if like our son he prefers to learn numbers before colors. Apart from the obvious fact that kids shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV set, our experience is that a child of one can benefit from these DVDs. The reviewers who reported that their child was bored had much older children than that --- the first 3 DVDs on numbers, colors, and shapes are designed for the very young, that's why the numbers only go up to 10.Kids' ability to memorize at the age of 2 or 3 is unbelievable. My son would ask me to play such or such DVD saying ""my! my! my!"" or ""it! it! it!"" and I would wonder what he was trying to say until I noticed that the DVD cover of one volume had a big ""my"" on it, of another a big ""it"" on it, etc. As I wrote earlier, our son wouldn't learn from us, but we would sit patiently with him and watch the DVDs with him, and he liked that. It's fair to say that the DVDs are much better teachers than us. One reviewer said that it could be torture for the parents to listen, but I for one didn't experience it that way at all, I didn't mind it that they would repeat ""yellow"" a dozen times, I enjoyed it.A little off topic but of possible interest: I strongly recommend the ""Baby Einstein"" series (I hate the name), which our son loved and still loves so much. Especially good for an urban child to see the countryside, animals, agricultural machines. It doesn't work for an adult so well, but our son absolutely loves the series. And another absolutely awesome thing are all the learning apps you can get on a smartphone (especially on the iphone, not so much on android as of Feb 2012). While we were traveling my 2 and half year old son borrowed my android phone, which only has one half-decent app for kids, while I was dozing, returned it to me after half an hour and proceeded to count from 1 to 10 ... in French! Absolutely unbelievable. So get those apps now and teach your kid foreign languages too!",5,Get the timing right,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,3394,"['Here', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'very', 'normal', 'kids', 'learn', 'read', 'early', 'English', 'merely', 'warm-up', 'serious', 'thing', 'Chinese', 'nearly', '2', 'half', 'years', 'age', 'son', 'can', 'count', 'twenties', 'read', 'spell', 'not', 'write', 'pen', 'words', 'taught', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'do', 'would', ""n't"", 'listen', 'learned', 'everything', 'preschool', 'DVDs.He', 'started', 'numbers', '1', 'shapes', '14', 'months', 'colors', '18', 'months', 'sight', 'words', '24', 'months', 'where', 'now', 'actually', 'started', 'showing', 'colors', 'when', 'was', 'about', '10', 'months', 'was', 'not', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'much', 'preferred', 'Noddy', 'toyland', 'insisted', 'few', 'weeks', 'then', 'gave', 'up', 'playground', 'knew', 'colors', 'did', ""n't"", 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'enter', 'rat', 'race', 'figured', ""'d"", 'pick', 'up', 'eventually', 'had', 'One', 'day', 'got', 'play', 'meet', 'numbers', 'had', ""n't"", 'planned', 'show', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'colors', 'what', 'liked', 'learned', 'numbers', 'week', 'so', 'then', 'learning', 'gone', 'almost', 'uninterrupted', 'interruptions', 'included', 'Noddy', 'Mickey', 'Pingu', 'Shaun', 'sheep', 'started', 'numbers', 'quite', 'early', 'actually', 'spent', 'quite', 'bit', 'time', 'DVD', 'colors', 'were', 'digested', 'about', 'one', 'month', 'once', 'was', 'ready', 'it.Timing', 'will', 'greatly', 'affect', 'kid', 'experience', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'guiding', 'child', 'letting', 'child', 'decide', 'too', 'son', 'learn', 'numbers', 'colors', 'Apart', 'obvious', 'fact', 'kids', 'should', ""n't"", 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'front', 'TV', 'set', 'experience', 'child', 'one', 'can', 'benefit', 'DVDs', 'reviewers', 'who', 'reported', 'child', 'was', 'bored', 'had', 'much', 'older', 'children', 'first', '3', 'DVDs', 'numbers', 'colors', 'shapes', 'are', 'designed', 'very', 'young', 'why', 'numbers', 'only', 'go', 'up', '10.Kids', 'ability', 'memorize', 'age', '2', '3', 'unbelievable', 'son', 'would', 'ask', 'play', 'such', 'such', 'DVD', 'saying', 'would', 'wonder', 'what', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'noticed', 'DVD', 'cover', 'one', 'volume', 'had', 'big', 'big', 'etc', 'wrote', 'earlier', 'son', 'would', ""n't"", 'learn', 'would', 'sit', 'patiently', 'watch', 'DVDs', 'liked', 'fair', 'say', 'DVDs', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'teachers', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'could', 'be', 'torture', 'parents', 'listen', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'experience', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'would', 'repeat', 'yellow', 'dozen', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'it.A', 'little', 'off', 'topic', 'possible', 'interest', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'series', 'hate', 'name', 'son', 'loved', 'still', 'so', 'much', 'Especially', 'good', 'urban', 'child', 'see', 'countryside', 'animals', 'agricultural', 'machines', ""n't"", 'work', 'adult', 'so', 'well', 'son', 'absolutely', 'series', 'absolutely', 'awesome', 'thing', 'are', 'learning', 'can', 'get', 'smartphone', 'especially', 'iphone', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'android', 'Feb', '2012', 'were', 'traveling', '2', 'half', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'borrowed', 'android', 'phone', 'only', 'one', 'half-decent', 'app', 'kids', 'was', 'dozing', 'returned', 'hour', 'proceeded', 'count', '1', '10', 'French', 'Absolutely', 'unbelievable', 'So', 'get', 'apps', 'now', 'teach', 'kid', 'foreign', 'languages', 'too']",N/A
