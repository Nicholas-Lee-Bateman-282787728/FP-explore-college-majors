734721,A1THJ5GJF9NLCS,B000087F5C,"BLee ""bpslee""","[18, 29]","Three of the top American musicians met together to make music.  I'm most attracted to Barenboim. Not so much because Arrau had ears for him (along with Argerich whom he also said was inconsistent) among the younger generation. I have heard/seen his Mozart Concertos where he was just short of the spontaneity of his mastercalss teacher Edwin Fischer. I've also seen/heard his Debussy-- Les Preludes, not much poetry I'm afraid despite a colossal technique and a very balanced and luminous piano sound. Nevertheless, I like his Beethoven Cello Sonatas with DuPre (CDs only).  I like his Triple Concerto here. I like his Choral Fantasy even more which was just brilliant.I'm not sure this is the right repertoire or right partners for Mr Perlman. There wasn't much room for him to show his talents.  A little better would be the case of Ma Yoyo. Needless to say, they were supported by one of the best orchestras in the world. Suffice to say  I have a feeling that for one reason or another, becasue of their style or whatever,  Mr Perlman and Ma Yoyo are usually better supported by an Amercian orchetra.Viewers may well have a pleasant surprise to learn that the climax is to be found from the Choral Fanstasy. One, this piece is not very often performed. Two, Barenboim did this piece marvelously well. Three the singers were equally marvelous though they are less well known to most audience.The sound and picture of this DVD was filmed in 95' and is as good as one could expect. It's a pity that it only lasts 59 min. and without any encores or bonus or the like.",3,Choral Fantasy is the Jewel of the Crown,1057968000,"07 12, 2003",2003,1567,"['Three', 'top', 'American', 'musicians', 'met', 'together', 'make', 'music', ""'m"", 'most', 'attracted', 'Barenboim', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'Arrau', 'had', 'ears', 'Argerich', 'whom', 'also', 'said', 'was', 'inconsistent', 'younger', 'generation', 'have', 'heard/seen', 'Mozart', 'Concertos', 'where', 'was', 'just', 'short', 'spontaneity', 'mastercalss', 'teacher', 'Edwin', 'Fischer', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen/heard', 'Debussy', 'Les', 'Preludes', 'not', 'much', 'poetry', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'colossal', 'technique', 'very', 'balanced', 'luminous', 'piano', 'sound', 'Nevertheless', 'Beethoven', 'Cello', 'Sonatas', 'DuPre', 'CDs', 'only', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'here', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'even', 'more', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'right', 'repertoire', 'right', 'partners', 'Mr', 'Perlman', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'show', 'talents', 'little', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'case', 'Ma', 'Yoyo', 'Needless', 'say', 'were', 'supported', 'one', 'best', 'orchestras', 'world', 'Suffice', 'say', 'have', 'feeling', 'one', 'reason', 'becasue', 'style', 'whatever', 'Mr', 'Perlman', 'Ma', 'Yoyo', 'are', 'usually', 'better', 'supported', 'Amercian', 'orchetra.Viewers', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'learn', 'climax', 'be', 'found', 'Choral', 'Fanstasy', 'One', 'piece', 'not', 'very', 'often', 'performed', 'Two', 'Barenboim', 'did', 'piece', 'marvelously', 'well', 'Three', 'singers', 'were', 'equally', 'marvelous', 'are', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'most', 'audience.The', 'sound', 'picture', 'DVD', 'was', 'filmed', '95', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'could', 'expect', 'pity', 'only', '59', 'min', 'encores', 'bonus', 'like']","Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano / Barenboim, Ma, Perlman"
734722,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,B000087F5C,David Bower,"[2, 2]","Yo-Yo Ma, Daniel Barenboim, and Itzhak Perlman are all legendary performers in their own right and to have the pleasure to hear and watch them performing together is a true joy to one who appreciates classical music and the music of Beethoven in particular. Although this recording dates from 1995 it is still a delight to watch and to hear. The main reason I selected this disc was the presence of Beethoven's Triple Concerto, the Choral Fantasy was a pleasant bonus.Having been a student of the cello for many years I was particularly interested in a version of the triple concerto that would let me have glimpses of Yo-Yo Ma playing the cello so the selection of this DVD version was a logical choice. The camera work is of excellent quality and provides a balanced view of all three soloists as well as good views of the Berlin Philharmonic.While the audio is acceptable and permits full enjoyment of the music, it is not up to contemporary standards; another recording of the Berlin Philharmonic, the Herbert von Karajan Memorial Concert of 2008 on Blu-ray shows the artist and the orchestra to much better advantage. Having said that I must again point out the marvelous playing of the three soloists involved in this recording and admit their excellence compensates for the lesser audio quality.This is a fine addition to the collections of anyone who appreciates musical professionalism; I recommend it highly.",5,Professionalism is a Joy to Hear and Watch,1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,1418,"['Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'are', 'legendary', 'performers', 'own', 'right', 'have', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'watch', 'performing', 'together', 'true', 'joy', 'one', 'who', 'classical', 'music', 'music', 'Beethoven', 'particular', 'recording', 'dates', '1995', 'still', 'delight', 'watch', 'hear', 'main', 'reason', 'selected', 'disc', 'was', 'presence', 'Beethoven', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'was', 'pleasant', 'bonus.Having', 'been', 'student', 'cello', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'particularly', 'interested', 'version', 'triple', 'concerto', 'would', 'let', 'have', 'glimpses', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'playing', 'cello', 'selection', 'DVD', 'version', 'was', 'logical', 'choice', 'camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'quality', 'balanced', 'view', 'three', 'soloists', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'views', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic.While', 'audio', 'acceptable', 'full', 'enjoyment', 'music', 'not', 'up', 'contemporary', 'standards', 'recording', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic', 'Herbert', 'von', 'Karajan', 'Memorial', 'Concert', '2008', 'Blu-ray', 'artist', 'orchestra', 'much', 'better', 'advantage', 'Having', 'said', 'must', 'again', 'point', 'out', 'marvelous', 'playing', 'three', 'soloists', 'involved', 'recording', 'admit', 'excellence', 'compensates', 'lesser', 'audio', 'quality.This', 'fine', 'addition', 'collections', 'anyone', 'who', 'musical', 'professionalism', 'recommend', 'highly']","Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano / Barenboim, Ma, Perlman"

734725,A2GVFB8PHXGP2H,B000087F5C,Joseph Barbarie,"[9, 9]","I first heard Daniel Barenboim when I was a teenager.  The performance was of Mozart's d minor piano concerto, with the Orchestre National de Paris.  I had heard other versions of the d minor concerto previously -- Uchida's, probably -- but this one was different.  The words that come to mind are ""virile,"" ""masculine"", almost ""clangorous"" or ""metallic"", like the sounds of an army invading, shields and armor rattling.  Then I went through a major Glenn Gould phase in college, and kind of forgot about Barenboim.This DVD, however, was all I needed to remind me.  While the disc, as a whole, is masterful -- tremendous program played by tremendous players -- there is one moment, later in the ""Choral Fantasia"" which made it worth the price of purchase.  It is the variation where Beethoven has the piano converse with the wind choir.Barenboim, conducting as well as playing, suddenly begins lifting his hands really high from the keyboard, in between beats.  At first, I am puzzled by what looks like some over-acting at the keyboard.  Then it hits me; he's showing the wind-players his hands to let them see where his rhythmic accents are falling.When I think about the difficulty implicit in this -- playing a Beethoven solo piano passage, and simultaneously cueing players on the other side of the auditorium to lock into the parts of the rhythm not played by the piano -- my mind boggles.Barenboim is a genius on the order of the old nineteenth century virtuosi like Rubinstein, Liszt, or Henselt.",4,Barenboim in excelsis,1179187200,"05 15, 2007",2007,1504,"['first', 'heard', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'performance', 'was', 'Mozart', 'd', 'minor', 'piano', 'concerto', 'Orchestre', 'National', 'Paris', 'had', 'heard', 'other', 'versions', 'd', 'minor', 'concerto', 'previously', 'Uchida', 'probably', 'one', 'was', 'different', 'words', 'come', 'mind', 'are', 'virile', 'masculine', 'almost', 'clangorous', 'metallic', 'sounds', 'army', 'invading', 'shields', 'armor', 'rattling', 'Then', 'went', 'major', 'Glenn', 'Gould', 'phase', 'college', 'kind', 'forgot', 'Barenboim.This', 'DVD', 'however', 'was', 'needed', 'remind', 'disc', 'whole', 'masterful', 'tremendous', 'program', 'played', 'tremendous', 'players', 'one', 'moment', 'later', 'Choral', 'Fantasia', 'made', 'price', 'purchase', 'variation', 'where', 'Beethoven', 'piano', 'converse', 'wind', 'choir.Barenboim', 'conducting', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'suddenly', 'lifting', 'hands', 'really', 'high', 'keyboard', 'beats', 'first', 'am', 'puzzled', 'what', 'over-acting', 'keyboard', 'Then', 'showing', 'wind-players', 'hands', 'let', 'see', 'where', 'rhythmic', 'accents', 'are', 'falling.When', 'think', 'difficulty', 'implicit', 'playing', 'Beethoven', 'solo', 'piano', 'passage', 'simultaneously', 'cueing', 'players', 'other', 'side', 'auditorium', 'lock', 'parts', 'rhythm', 'not', 'played', 'piano', 'mind', 'boggles.Barenboim', 'genius', 'order', 'old', 'nineteenth', 'century', 'virtuosi', 'Rubinstein', 'Liszt', 'Henselt']","Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano / Barenboim, Ma, Perlman"

734727,AUX9KZUUB3YCE,B000087F5C,R. Nicholson,"[55, 55]","A fabulous DVD!This disc was recorded in 1995 and features Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, Daniel Barenboim (on piano and orchestra conductor) with the Berlin Philharmonic.I became interested in this music because I'd heard the Choral Fantasy while listening to CBC radio 2 (Canada). When I looked up the Choral Fantasy on Amazon.com I found that it was available on DVD and it also contained  Beethoven's Triple Concerto. It was a pleasant surprise to find both these magnificent works on one disc.There were many things I liked about this disc...to mention a few.-while the Choral Fantasy is awesome on its own (with Daniel Barenboim giving a virtuoso performance), it is the Triple Concerto that is the spectacular focal point on this disc. Its infectious melody is performed with such pace and intensity that I sensed that all participants were totally absorbed in giving what could only be described, at least to me, as a performance of a lifetime.-this disc is the perfect example of why classical music such as this should be on DVD as well as CD. The video of this performance does so much to enhance the enjoyment of the music; the camera work and film editing for the entire disc make this DVD a superior product. There were close ups of fingers and instruments, as well as shots of individuals and some panoramic views of the orchestra. The camera switching was done with impeccable timing and with great effect; for instance, there is one point in the 3rd movement of the Triple Concerto that you could see the perspiration glistening on Yo-Yo Ma's brow as rivulets of sweat ran down his cheek. Just great camera work!-the emotional impact of the music on Ma , Perlman and Barenboim during this performance cannot be overstated; the intensity and concentration on the faces, as well as the animated body language of the principals could be clearly seen and appreciated.-and finally, it appeared that all three featured performers, as well as the orchestra and chorus were elated with the way this performance continued to progress during the evening; a sense of joyous accomplishment seemed to permeate the orchestral stage... What a thrill it must have been to have witnessed live.Highlight of the disc:So many to consider, but I think my favorite part of this entire disc is Yo-Yo Ma's beginning of the beautiful Largo (2nd movement); He is totally absorbed in his work, every note played with the utmost tenderness and feeling. Stirring to watch.All in all, a 5 star performance in audio, video and most importantly emotional content. It's just hard to imagine finding a better Triple Concerto or Choral Fantasy anywhere.P.S. The only thing I found odd about this performance was the delayed audience response at the end of the Triple Concerto. (one of the other reviewers mentioned this as well) I got the feeling from the way the audience finally responded, that they weren't quite sure it was over (that no one wanted to be the first to clap or cheer); the only other explanations would be that they didn't like it (unlikely) or were so enraptured with the music they simply forget when it was finished.",5,"The Triple Concerto...magnificent in audio, video & emotion",1116374400,"05 18, 2005",2005,3115,"['fabulous', 'DVD', 'disc', 'was', 'recorded', '1995', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'Itzhak', 'Perlman', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'piano', 'orchestra', 'conductor', 'Berlin', 'Philharmonic.I', 'became', 'interested', 'music', ""'d"", 'heard', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'listening', 'CBC', 'radio', '2', 'Canada', 'When', 'looked', 'up', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'Amazon.com', 'found', 'was', 'available', 'DVD', 'also', 'contained', 'Beethoven', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'find', 'magnificent', 'works', 'one', 'were', 'many', 'things', 'liked', 'disc', 'mention', 'few.-while', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'awesome', 'own', 'Daniel', 'Barenboim', 'giving', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'spectacular', 'focal', 'point', 'disc', 'infectious', 'melody', 'performed', 'such', 'pace', 'intensity', 'sensed', 'participants', 'were', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'giving', 'what', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'least', 'performance', 'lifetime.-this', 'disc', 'perfect', 'example', 'why', 'classical', 'music', 'such', 'should', 'be', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'CD', 'video', 'performance', 'so', 'much', 'enhance', 'enjoyment', 'music', 'camera', 'work', 'film', 'editing', 'entire', 'disc', 'make', 'DVD', 'superior', 'product', 'were', 'close', 'ups', 'fingers', 'instruments', 'as', 'well', 'shots', 'individuals', 'panoramic', 'views', 'orchestra', 'camera', 'switching', 'was', 'done', 'impeccable', 'timing', 'great', 'effect', 'instance', 'one', 'point', '3rd', 'movement', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'could', 'see', 'perspiration', 'glistening', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'brow', 'rivulets', 'sweat', 'ran', 'down', 'cheek', 'Just', 'great', 'camera', 'work', '-the', 'emotional', 'impact', 'music', 'Ma', 'Perlman', 'Barenboim', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overstated', 'intensity', 'concentration', 'as', 'well', 'animated', 'body', 'language', 'principals', 'could', 'be', 'clearly', 'seen', 'appreciated.-and', 'finally', 'appeared', 'three', 'featured', 'performers', 'as', 'well', 'orchestra', 'chorus', 'were', 'elated', 'way', 'performance', 'continued', 'progress', 'evening', 'sense', 'joyous', 'accomplishment', 'seemed', 'permeate', 'orchestral', 'stage', 'What', 'thrill', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'have', 'witnessed', 'live.Highlight', 'disc', 'So', 'many', 'consider', 'think', 'favorite', 'part', 'entire', 'disc', 'Yo-Yo', 'Ma', 'beginning', 'beautiful', 'Largo', '2nd', 'movement', 'totally', 'absorbed', 'work', 'note', 'played', 'utmost', 'tenderness', 'feeling', 'Stirring', 'watch.All', '5', 'star', 'performance', 'audio', 'video', 'most', 'importantly', 'emotional', 'content', 'just', 'hard', 'imagine', 'finding', 'better', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'Choral', 'Fantasy', 'anywhere.P.S', 'only', 'thing', 'found', 'odd', 'performance', 'was', 'delayed', 'audience', 'response', 'end', 'Triple', 'Concerto', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'as', 'well', 'got', 'feeling', 'way', 'audience', 'finally', 'responded', 'were', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sure', 'was', 'over', 'one', 'wanted', 'be', 'first', 'clap', 'cheer', 'only', 'other', 'explanations', 'would', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'unlikely', 'were', 'so', 'enraptured', 'music', 'simply', 'forget', 'when', 'was', 'finished']","Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano / Barenboim, Ma, Perlman"
