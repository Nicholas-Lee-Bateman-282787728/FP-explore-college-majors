103195,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,0790734680,A Customer,"[2, 6]","Kind of an interesting story, but I didn't really enjoy it.Summary:John Kelso (John Cusack) is a young author who has been hired by Town &amp; Country Magazine to write a piece on Jim Williams' (Kevin Spacey) Christmas party in Savannah, Georgia.  When John arrives in Savannah we are introduced to a number of characters including debarred lawyers, voodoo practitioners, and transvestites.  John hits it off well with Jim but when Jim ends up killing his lover, Billy Carl Hanson (Jude Law), the intrigue really begins.  John decides to help clear Jim if he can write the story as a book.  Jim is eventually acquitted but dies from a heart attack caused by the spirit of Billy Hanson, his murdered lover, and John ends up moving to Savannah permanently.My Commentary:Undoubtedly, my summary doesn't do the story justice, but that's the gist of it.  And, so you know, the story is based on a true story.  Despite being true, I failed to see the reason why certain scenes in the movie were included when they were seemingly unrelated to the rest of the story.  There is one scene in particular when Lady Chablis (Lady Chablis), the transvestite, follows John to a fraternity dinner and embarrasses him.  Granted, I thought Lady Chablis was great (it couldn't have been that hard to play herself), but the scene made no sense.  Sadly, there are a lot of scenes like that.Also, though Kevin Spacey was great, I didn't particularly enjoy John Cusack.  It's probably because I never really enjoy John Cusack, but his portrayal was not memorable.  Perhaps the book is better, but I didn't really enjoy this movie all that much.

John Kelso (John Cusack), a reporter from New York, is sent to Savannah to write a story about the Christmas Party given by Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey).  It all turns bad when Spacey's character kills somebody and he'll have to face trial for first degree murder.  Just like in the novel, Eastwood tries to re-build the atmosphere and the life style from Savannah, the people living there and their habits.Still there are some things that go wrong. First there's the length of the movie - almost 3 hours. Then there's the plot: it's a normal crime-story, with a murder, then investigations (still this time they are not presented through the eyes of the police, almost absent throughout the whole movie, but through the eyes of the nosy reporter), and of course the trial. Plus a predictable ending. No twists and turns, no surprises. Just a plain old story. I don't see what's the point of Lady Chablis in the movie, she (he) is present in too many scenes, and also the relationship between Cusack and Alison Eastwood (Mandy in the film) kind of developes out of nothing.This isn't a movie that I'd rush out and rent but if you have time to kill or are really bored, then maybe pick up a copy to rent.",3,Not Bad... but Not Great,1153526400,"07 22, 2006",2006,1331,"['Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'was', 'good', 'crime', 'movie', 'kept', 'watching', 'end', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'John', 'Kelso', 'John', 'Cusack', 'reporter', 'New', 'York', 'sent', 'Savannah', 'write', 'story', 'Christmas', 'Party', 'given', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'bad', 'when', 'Spacey', 'character', 'somebody', ""'ll"", 'have', 'face', 'trial', 'first', 'degree', 'murder', 'Just', 'novel', 'Eastwood', 're-build', 'atmosphere', 'life', 'style', 'Savannah', 'people', 'living', 'there', 'habits.Still', 'are', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'First', 'length', 'movie', 'almost', '3', 'hours', 'Then', 'plot', 'normal', 'crime-story', 'murder', 'then', 'investigations', 'still', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'presented', 'eyes', 'police', 'almost', 'absent', 'whole', 'movie', 'eyes', 'nosy', 'reporter', 'course', 'trial', 'predictable', 'ending', 'twists', 'turns', 'surprises', 'Just', 'plain', 'old', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'point', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'movie', 'present', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'also', 'relationship', 'Cusack', 'Alison', 'Eastwood', 'Mandy', 'film', 'kind', 'developes', 'nothing.This', ""n't"", 'movie', ""'d"", 'rush', 'out', 'rent', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'are', 'really', 'bored', 'then', 'maybe', 'pick', 'up', 'copy', 'rent']",N/A

Then I heard of the movie, and more than one person who had read the book mentioned it. Some said it was better than the book, and some were disappointed. So it went to the back burner for me until this afternoon. As you can see, I'm giving it five stars.There are so many interesting elements to this story that I scarcely know where to begin. John Kelso (John Cusack) has come to Savannah, Georgia, to cover the Christmas party of millionaire eccentric Jim Williams (Kevin Spacey). Billy Hanson (Jude Law) is crashes the posh party and makes a drunken fuss, demanding money from Kelso and basically being obnoxious.Later that night, after the party guests have all gone, Williams shoots and kills Billy. He claims self defense, but the DA thinks otherwise.But this murder is just the outline for a far more complex story, involving quite a few of the colorful characters that make life interesting in Savannah. There's a voodoo priestess, a perfectly gorgeous drag queen (Lady Chablis playing herself), a man who walks an invisible dog, another who has horseflies on tethers that are tied to his clothing, and assorted somewhat less obviously eccentric types.What had started as a small article for Town & Country Magazine has now morphed into a book that Kelso is determined to write, and which involves him in Williams' defense. Starting from the premise that he can ferret out information about Billy's life, and that Williams cannot hire a private detective because they are all former cops, Kelso has the perfect excuse to go poking and prodding and asking all sorts of questions.Like Kelso, I became so enchanted with Savannah that it was easy to understand why he wanted to stay instead of returning to New York.",5,Unexpectedly Brilliant,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",2012,1805,"['first', 'heard', 'book', 'nobody', 'told', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'Then', 'heard', 'movie', 'more', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'mentioned', 'said', 'was', 'better', 'book', 'were', 'disappointed', 'went', 'back', 'burner', 'afternoon', 'can', 'see', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'interesting', 'elements', 'story', 'scarcely', 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'John', 'Kelso', 'John', 'Cusack', 'come', 'Savannah', 'Georgia', 'cover', 'Christmas', 'party', 'millionaire', 'eccentric', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Billy', 'Hanson', 'Jude', 'Law', 'crashes', 'posh', 'party', 'drunken', 'fuss', 'demanding', 'money', 'Kelso', 'basically', 'being', 'obnoxious.Later', 'night', 'party', 'guests', 'have', 'gone', 'Williams', 'shoots', 'kills', 'Billy', 'defense', 'DA', 'murder', 'just', 'outline', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'story', 'involving', 'quite', 'few', 'colorful', 'characters', 'make', 'life', 'interesting', 'Savannah', 'voodoo', 'priestess', 'perfectly', 'gorgeous', 'drag', 'queen', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'playing', 'man', 'who', 'invisible', 'dog', 'who', 'horseflies', 'tethers', 'are', 'tied', 'clothing', 'assorted', 'somewhat', 'less', 'obviously', 'eccentric', 'types.What', 'had', 'started', 'small', 'article', 'Town', 'Country', 'Magazine', 'now', 'morphed', 'book', 'Kelso', 'determined', 'write', 'Williams', 'defense', 'Starting', 'premise', 'can', 'ferret', 'out', 'information', 'Billy', 'life', 'Williams', 'can', 'not', 'hire', 'private', 'detective', 'are', 'former', 'cops', 'Kelso', 'perfect', 'excuse', 'go', 'poking', 'prodding', 'asking', 'sorts', 'questions.Like', 'Kelso', 'became', 'so', 'enchanted', 'Savannah', 'was', 'easy', 'understand', 'why', 'wanted', 'stay', 'instead', 'returning', 'New', 'York']",N/A

In a way they compliment each other; the book provides the real story, and the film allows you to read the book and have the characters in your mind.  There were a couple of extraneous things that could have been done away with without damaging the film.  For example, the John Cussak love interest did not appear in the book at all, and really didn't add to the film, although Ms. Eastwood did a good enough job.The book was less about the murder trial, and more about the bizzare inhabitants the author encountered.  I think Clint Eastwood did a great balancing act; that is to say, struck a good balance between displaying these excentrics and moving the plot along.The Lady Chablis and Minerva were the two most interesting characters in the film.The DVD itself has some interesting extras, including interviews with some of the people on whom the book was based.  I liked the fact that they included many of them in the movie; for example, the real-life defense lawyer plays the judge in the movie, and many of the ladies at the card club played in that scene.Overall, I recommend this film highly, especially if you are into flicks that are character-driven, and take their time unfolding.",4,"A little flabby, but otherwise excellent",1082332800,"04 19, 2004",2004,1238,"['have', 'read', 'book', 'bought', 'DVD', 'way', 'compliment', 'other', 'book', 'real', 'story', 'film', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'characters', 'mind', 'were', 'couple', 'extraneous', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'away', 'damaging', 'film', 'example', 'John', 'Cussak', 'love', 'interest', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'book', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'film', 'Ms.', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'good', 'enough', 'job.The', 'book', 'was', 'less', 'murder', 'trial', 'more', 'bizzare', 'author', 'encountered', 'think', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'great', 'balancing', 'act', 'say', 'struck', 'good', 'balance', 'displaying', 'excentrics', 'moving', 'plot', 'along.The', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'Minerva', 'were', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'characters', 'film.The', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'extras', 'including', 'interviews', 'people', 'whom', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'liked', 'fact', 'included', 'many', 'movie', 'example', 'real-life', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'judge', 'movie', 'many', 'ladies', 'card', 'club', 'played', 'scene.Overall', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'especially', 'are', 'flicks', 'are', 'character-driven', 'take', 'time', 'unfolding']",N/A

However, a great cast, beautiful location, and an intriguing story make up for the flaws. The film shows the grandeur of the south, and the seedy world beneath the beauty. If you enjoy mysteries, beautiful scenary, and fine acting, you should buy MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL today!The film features a wonderful cast. Kevin Spacey superbly plays the character of Williams. He brings to the character an eccentric undertone hidden by a convincing Southern charm. John Cusack is excellent as John Kelso. The character seems to retain his northern culture while still being talented enough to be well recieved by the people of Savannah. This shows enormous talent on Cusack's part. The accents are surprisingly convincing for the most part (even for Englishman Jude Law). The cast makes the film  better and more intriguing.Savannah is a gorgeously southern city. The trees provide shade and add to the atmosphere. This wonderful city provides excellent locations and a breathtaking backdrop to the film. As the events of the film are true, the location is all the more important. By shooting in Savannah, the film is enriched and integrity is restored to the tale.In the seventies, a horrid crime took place in Savannah. An aristrocrat named Williams stood accused of murder. The story and trial captivated Savannah and the nation. Thus, a splendid novel was written. From the novel came a briliantly done film. The film is a bit too long, but everything else about it is wonderful. MIDNIGHT is a film that shall be talked about for years.MIDNIGHT is a great film. It has a wonderful cast including Kevin Spacey, Jude Law, and Anne Haney. The locations show beauty and ugliness as well as good and evil.

I finished reading the book a couple weeks back and was just blown away!  I am usually a little hesitant to read non-fiction, but it read exactly like a thriller novel and my original worries were gone within a chapter.  So after finishing, I heard that there was a Clint Eastwood directed movie out there as well and knew I had to see it.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the same reason I do for all book to movie productions...it is just not always as good as the book. Now some are MUCH worse than the book, I grant you this, and this is why I rated it as highly as I did.  It was definitely a great movie and followed the book pretty closely throughout, but there were enough differences for me to be slightly bothered.  Kevin Spacey, as always, is just amazing in his role as the main character in the film, and I found John Cusak to really fit the role of the author of the book amazingly well.  A bit headstrong but naive at the same time...he nailed it.  It also depicted the feeling of eerieness that I felt present throughout the book when reading, and that was awesome to see it captured as it was.

My only complaint was that more time was spent on the Lady Chablis character and less on the fact that it actually took four trials for Williams to be acquitted.

There is no such relationship in the book.- Lady Chablis is put on the witness stand in the movie but not the book.- Luther Driggers serves on the jury in the movie but not in the book.The above changes are irritating to me but I can live with them. The main change that I was upset about is that Jim Williams is found not guilty after one trial. In the book Williams goes through four trials - the first three of which he is found guilty.Another minor complaint is that the movie can not go into as much detail as the book when describing Savannah and its inhabitants and history.,2,Mediocre adaptation of an excellent book,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,1175,"['had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'probably', 'give', 'movie', 'higher', 'rating', 'own', 'good', 'movie', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'interesting', 'storyline.The', 'trouble', 'movie', 'had', 'MAJOR', 'points', 'book', 'book', 'work', 'non', 'fiction', 'movie', 'also', 'MAJOR', 'points', 'reality.Some', 'changes', 'are', 'main', 'character', 'John', 'Kelso', 'played', 'Cusack', 'fabricated', 'movie', 'investigating', 'crime', 'not', 'part', 'book.-', 'love', 'interest', 'Kelso', 'lounge', 'singer', 'also', 'fabricated', 'movie', 'such', 'relationship', 'book.-', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'put', 'witness', 'stand', 'movie', 'not', 'book.-', 'Luther', 'Driggers', 'jury', 'movie', 'not', 'book.The', 'changes', 'are', 'irritating', 'can', 'live', 'main', 'change', 'was', 'upset', 'about', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'one', 'trial', 'book', 'Williams', 'four', 'trials', 'first', 'three', 'found', 'guilty.Another', 'minor', 'complaint', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'much', 'detail', 'book', 'when', 'describing', 'Savannah', 'inhabitants', 'history']",N/A

Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil takes viewers into the insular biome of the coastal lowlands and introduces them to a sophisticated and quietly gay antiques dealer (the chameleonic Spacey in a role he took to interestingly well...) who either murdered a notorious local hustler (a young Jude Law) or killed him in self defense. There's also a voodoo priestess, a world-famous bulldog, an eccentric inventor who just might possess a substance that could poison the population of a mid-sized city, a colorful old school lawyer, a flamboyant drag queen, a visiting investigative reporter who knows a good story when he sees one, and added into the mix is the sun-bathed culture and vitality of Savannah itself.

Sanderman,"[2, 3]","MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is a film that, regardless of its justice to the novel from which it is adapted, fails to realize itself.  Throughout the film's 155 minutes, there are spectacular flashes of character and intriguing story, most notably from Kevin Spacey who superbly plays what should have been the main character.For some reason, John Cusack is the central character of this movie, playing a narrator who witnesses Savannah in all of its splendor.  Unfortunately, his character does not really add anything to the magic of the city and is rather boring to watch.  I have not read the book, but I believe that much of the film's disjointed feel arises from the fact that so much has been left out.  There are so many rich characters and side storylines in this film that just do not receive any justice.  The effect of this is to render them pointless and lead the audience to question their relevance.Despite its flaws, MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is still a decent and entertaining movie to watch.

The film begins with a journalist, John Kelso, from New York City who is sent to Savannah to cover the annual Christmas party that is thrown by one of the city's aristocrats, Jim Williams. What begins as a story about Christmas hams, mistletoe, and decorated trees becomes a suspenseful tale about murder and secrets. The real story is not about the murder and trail but about the people in Savannah who are even more colorful than the houses and plantations.Kelso, played by John Cusak, begins the film as a naive journalist who is a bit aggravated that he has been assigned to cover a Christmas party in the South. He believes that it will be a bore and that nothing in Savannah will compare to the drama and life of NYC. Within the first hour, his judgment on the southern city has changed. Jim Williams, played by Kevin Spacey, is the epitome or southern money. He lives in a giant mansion and has an enormous group of ""friends"" who are more eccentric than anyone that Kelso has met in NYC. On the night of the party, Williams' lover (played by Jude Law) becomes enraged and becomes violent which prompts Williams to shoot him. Williams' crime only brings out more of the eccentric people in Savannah and further challenges Kelso's beliefs about the south.Though the movie is over 2 hours, I felt like it flew by and when the credits rolled I wanted more of the characters.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","The echoes of Southern Gothic don't come much more gothic than ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,"" Clint Eastwood's flawed adaptation of the bestselling true crime book. While the movie only dips briefly into the genteel decadence of the upper-crust South, and the general air of Savannah, it does have its fun moments and good acting.John Kelso (John Cusack) has come to Georgia to cover the famous Christmas party of the wealthy James Williams (Kevin Spacey). As well as Williams, Kelso ends up befriending a bevy of eccentrics, including some happy-go-lucky partygoers and the Lady Chablis (played by... the Lady Chablis), a drag queen with a mischievous sense of humor.But things go wrong after the party. Williams' employee/boyfriend Billy Carl Hanson (Jude Law) is found dead after a fight with Williams -- and Williams seems like the most likely suspect. As a not-so-pleasant trial begins, Kelso sets out to unravel the mystery of what really went on that night, and what the truth behind Hanson's death is.The biggest flaw of ""Midnight"" is that it is way too short for the material it stems from -- several years and multiple trials are compressed into a matter of weeks, and many of the endearingly freaky people of Savannah are given short shrift. Only the Lady Chablis gets enough time -- the guy with the flies and poison, for example, is touched on but never dealt with.But as far as execution goes, much of ""Midnight"" is quite charming -- warm, sleepy and a little overgrown, much like the vision of Savannah it shows. Even a midnight voodoo session doesn't break the mood. And Eastwood manages to give us a charming view of the eccentricities of ""Gone With the Wind on mescaline."" (Exhibit A: The guy walking an invisible, deceased dog)Both Cusack and Spacey do an excellent job bringing their characters to life: Cusack always seems a little out of the current, a realistic outsider, while Spacey exudes grace, charm and a sort of apologetic pride. Jude Law, for the brief time we see him, does a good job as the redneck hellraiser. And who can forget the Lady Chablis? Chablis is pretty clearly having a wonderful time (playing herself, no less). The one cast flaw is Alison Eastwood, who doesn't seem to bother acting.While ""Midnight of Good and Evil"" fails to live up to its promise, it is a charming and funny look at the deep South. Well-acted but patchily adapted, this is an amusing movie if you don't expect it to stick too closely to the book.",3,"Good, evil and the garden",1267833600,"03 6, 2010",2010,2475,"['echoes', 'Southern', 'Gothic', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'much', 'more', 'gothic', 'Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'flawed', 'adaptation', 'bestselling', 'true', 'crime', 'book', 'movie', 'only', 'briefly', 'genteel', 'decadence', 'upper-crust', 'South', 'general', 'air', 'Savannah', 'have', 'fun', 'moments', 'good', 'acting.John', 'Kelso', 'John', 'Cusack', 'come', 'Georgia', 'cover', 'famous', 'Christmas', 'party', 'wealthy', 'James', 'Williams', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'As', 'well', 'Williams', 'Kelso', 'up', 'befriending', 'bevy', 'eccentrics', 'including', 'happy-go-lucky', 'partygoers', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'played', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'drag', 'queen', 'mischievous', 'sense', 'humor.But', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'party', 'Williams', 'employee/boyfriend', 'Billy', 'Carl', 'Hanson', 'Jude', 'Law', 'found', 'dead', 'fight', 'Williams', 'Williams', 'most', 'likely', 'suspect', 'not-so-pleasant', 'trial', 'begins', 'Kelso', 'out', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'night', 'what', 'truth', 'Hanson', 'death', 'is.The', 'biggest', 'flaw', 'Midnight', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'material', 'several', 'years', 'multiple', 'trials', 'are', 'compressed', 'matter', 'weeks', 'many', 'endearingly', 'freaky', 'people', 'Savannah', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'Only', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'enough', 'time', 'guy', 'flies', 'poison', 'example', 'touched', 'never', 'dealt', 'with.But', 'as', 'far', 'execution', 'much', 'Midnight', 'quite', 'charming', 'warm', 'sleepy', 'little', 'overgrown', 'much', 'vision', 'Savannah', 'Even', 'midnight', 'voodoo', 'session', ""n't"", 'break', 'mood', 'Eastwood', 'manages', 'give', 'charming', 'view', 'eccentricities', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'mescaline', 'Exhibit', 'guy', 'walking', 'invisible', 'deceased', 'dog', 'Cusack', 'Spacey', 'do', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'Cusack', 'always', 'little', 'current', 'realistic', 'outsider', 'Spacey', 'grace', 'charm', 'sort', 'apologetic', 'pride', 'Jude', 'Law', 'brief', 'time', 'see', 'good', 'job', 'redneck', 'hellraiser', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'Chablis', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'having', 'wonderful', 'time', 'playing', 'less', 'one', 'cast', 'flaw', 'Alison', 'Eastwood', 'who', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bother', 'Midnight', 'Good', 'Evil', 'live', 'up', 'promise', 'charming', 'funny', 'look', 'deep', 'South', 'Well-acted', 'patchily', 'adapted', 'amusing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'stick', 'too', 'closely', 'book']",N/A

Jim lives a privileged life and knows his friends compete to be included on his guest list. Jim chose John Kelso, a writer for Town and Country magazine to review his Christmas party, *the* spectacular social event of the season. Jim's home is a mansion dating back to the Civil War, the property and buildings take up a full city block. I love how the film reveals so much about the history, mystery and exclusiveness of Savannah society. The eccentric characters who reside in this fair southern city are gradually introduced. They have so many facets to their unsual personalities and natures that the viewer is held captive, in suspense, anxiously waiting for dark ghosts to appear or well kept secrets to be revealed. I was glued to this film from start to finish. The demarcations of various levels in society as well as the deep southern culture were reason enough to remain entranced but then add to this mix a little voo doo ceremony in a cemetery and a very lovely black female entertainer named Lady Chablis, the film becomes nonstop entertainment. The eccentricities of specific characters makes the plot, drama, and murder mystery fit together like a good puzzle.John Kelso is nearly speechless when he discovers Mandy, a curvaceous and beautiful blonde knocking on his door during the wee hours of the morning, allegedly to borrow ice for a party next door. John is invited to a party where he learns that Mandy and her partner Joe Odom own a local jazz club. The southern lifestyle in Savannah is rich with fascinating customs. John Kelso is beginning to enjoy his assignment. At the William's Christmas party John meets even more wealthy and prestigious socialites, the upper crust of Savannah society.The morning after the party, John is awakened by police car sirens. He  learns a murder had occured at Mercer House and that Jim Williams was arrested. In his own study Jim had shot one of his hired workers, allegedly in self-defense. Jim pleads innocent to the charge of murder. As the trial begins, suspicions abound about Jim and his relationship to his employee. John Kelso believes Jim is innocent and does research to bring forth evidence to this effect. On one of his sojourns he meets ""Lady Chablis"" one of the most unusual characters in the film. She plays a key role in the trial. Jim's defense is sounding less convincing after the fact becomes known that there is no gunpowder residue on the hands of the victim. Sonny Jim's lawyer has his work cut out for him. The twists and turns of the plot during the trial make for a thrilling and sharply curved roller coaster of a viewing experience. One night John Kelso has a brain-storm. He visits Mandy who helps him sneak into the hospital morgue where by serendipity he discovers a clue which helps Jim's case. This crucial evidence provides the reasonable doubt necessary which will likely convince the jury to get Jim off the murder wrap.This film is most fascinating because of how it depicts the lifestyle of Savannah, local history, the unique southern culture and the different  social strata of society. The entire film is very delightful and entertaining. The characters are colorful, eccentric, and very charming ... Amazingly, the story is based on real events which happened in Savannah but with slight changes and variations made due to adapting the book into a film.

Just watched the DVD and found the movie and the acting very satisfying.  Eastwood presented a very mysterious and elegant atmosphere of Savannah.  Many scenes are shot in actual location, according to the map attached in ""Special Features.""John Cusack gives a very convincing and heartfelt performance in this one.  It's not easy as his character is the only one who doesn't have complex history behind.  He is an outsider trying to understand Savannah and the people in Savannah, among them the mysterious antique dealer Jim Williams, played by Kevin Spacey.  Kevin Spacey's performance in this film makes people understand what acting is really about.  He offers more than what you see and what you hear.  There is more, much more.  I rate the movie 4-star but Spacey's acting is 5-star in this one.Lady Chablis is good but ""she"" goes over the line sometimes.  There're scenes you wish could be shorter.

103270,A73DFWJE0CGY6,0790734680,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[1, 1]","The star of this movie is: John Cusack. Kevin Spacey. The Lady Chablis. Minerva, the juju woman. Savannah. Uga.Okay, Uga can only be a supporting star; #1.,his part is small - important, but limited, and #2., he's a dog.But everybody in this quirky, involving, dramatized true story is a star without a doubt, including a few folks you will recognize from other movie roles but not be able to put a name to. This is the sort of movie that attaches itself to followers of ""Northern Exposure"" and other vehicles for personal expression and individuality. The setting itself is spectacular; Savannah, Georgia, a town I could place on a map but until this didn't know much about, is suddenly at the top of my list of places to see before the end. There is undeniable Southern charm, the cliqueishness of a community dedicated to keeping outsiders in the dark, an indefinable spookiness aided by Spanish moss hanging from the trees and lush green gardens and dark corners everywhere; mystery permeates every frame of this film, augmented by a waggish I'm-Southern-and-you're-not attitude presented by almost everybody without rancor or arrogance. These are people comfortable in their own skins and they don't care if the visitor is particularly at ease or not.John Kelso (John Cusack), a writer for Town & Country Magazine, gleans the peach assignment of covering the annual and much-desired Christmas party hosted by Savannahian Jim Williams, an entrepreneur restorer of old mansions and art works who resides in the gorgeous former home of songwriter Johnny Mercer. The house itself is a character in the movie; classy, elegant, well-appointed, it is the architectural equivalent of its human conservator, Jim Williams, who oversees every aspect of his place in Savannah society with panache. Genteel is a word that applies to all but one of the principals here, and that principal makes his raucous and vulgar debut fairly early in the Christmas party. During John Kelso's tour of this beautiful home, as he is being shown around by Jim Williams, a loud, ill-dressed young man strides threateningly into the room yelling at Jim, and we are introduced to Billy Hanson (Jude Law), who is miffed that he wasn't included in the party. It's obvious from the start that there is more to this meeting than is immediately apparent, and you can watch the wheels turning in John Kelso's mind as he attempts to work it out. After the vulgar young man stomps out, an unruffled Jim Williams explains with perfect Southern charm, ""Uh, that was Billy Hanson, works part time in the shop - and can, at times, be a very colourful character.""Later on, John Kelso is awakened in his carriage-house quarters by a deal of noise and confusion, and wanders out into a surreal scandal which becomes his full induction into Savannah and all its many colours: wall-to-wall police at the Mercer home, all of Savannah milling about outside in the dark, and a dead Billy Hanson in the front room, an obviously traumatised Jim Williams giving an emotional account of Billy's demise in another room to the police detective. John Kelso is allowed to wander through the crime scene unchallenged for a few minutes until he himself realizes what he is doing and vacates.The movie swings into overdrive now in its parade of colourful characters. John Kelso, abandoning his Christmas party coverage in favour of instead writing a book about what he sees to be a sensational story, embarks upon an examination of everyone involved. The movie is clearly stolen by the Lady Chablis, a local showgirl and friend of many of the principals, who knows a little too much about everybody and who is, moreover, played to perfection by the actual Lady Chablis (I can't imagine anyone else in this role). Others in this group of individuals includes the actual defense attorney in the subsequent trial (in the movie he plays the judge); an old juju woman who communes with the dead; a juror in the trial who wanders through Savannah with a flock of horseflies attached to his person via threads superglued to the flies; an entertaining duo who run a club (the woman singer is played extremely well by Clint Eastwood's daughter Alison); and various other small parts that make up a cohesive whole of a truly unique and charming community.The fact that this true story was portrayed by many of the people who were actually involved is a great stroke of luck; they bring a light to the story that would fall a little flat otherwise. (The Lady Chablis is her own story, and it is impossible to look away when she is onscreen.) Kevin Spacey is unsurpassed in his portrayal (he even bears a remarkable resemblance to the real Jim Williams) and his wonderful Southern diction is worth listening to no matter what he is saying. John Cusack's wide-eyed-New-York-writer is well-played also. The only role i thought a bit stilted was Jude Law's Billy Hanson, which was jarring (perhaps on purpose) and seemed strained.The extras section, which includes a tour of the noted locations in Savannah, is as interesting as the movie itself, and as said previously, makes me eager to visit this beautiful city.",5,southern hospitality,1173312000,"03 8, 2007",2007,5142,"['star', 'movie',

And it was directed by Clint Eastwood. What do you want more now ?Kelso (Cusack) is a writer from New York city, assigned to cover an annual Christmas party thrown by rich antiques dealer Jim Williams (Spacey) in Savannah. Everything is great until Williams is arrested for the murder of one of his employees. Already enthralled by the eccentricity of Savannah, Kelso plunges headlong, helping Williams with his trial in exchange for information so he can write a book.Along the way he meets odd characters, including Lady Chablis, a transvestite, played by herself (as already mentioned). Her role is, in a sense, the binding force of the movie - she is deliciously, well, herself. She's worth the movie alone.All the actors have really come together to make great showings, as we would expect. However, this is marred by a completely unnecessary love story, and a voodoo lady whose sole role is apparently standing on tombstones, saying omnious things, and appearing in unlikely places saying more omnious things. She is also involved in a rather improbable moral which only serves to wrap everything up without rhyme nor reason.

103273,A36Z2FJ4EUV8M3,0790734680,Gary Lehmann,"[1, 3]","The best-selling novel entitled Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil by John Berendt has at long last come out as a DVD (rated R, 140 minutes long), directed by Clint Eastwood, but the movie is a great disappointment.  The exotic charms of the book do not get translated into the film.A young reporter, played by John Cusack, flies to Savannah to write 500 words for Town and Country about a Christmas party given by a Jim Williams, played by Kevin Spacey.  Williams turns out to be the perfect host, but very soon he is accused of murder and, as the details of the murder emerge, it comes out that Williams is homosexual, and that the dead man was his lover.The city of Savannah is a charming backwater of the South which supports a vast cast of interesting characters.  Some walk dogs that aren't there.  Some talk with the dead, and some hot wire houses and throw parties in the homes of absentee owners.  The most interesting character by far is The Lady Chablis, a transvestite show personality, played by herself.  Her performance is the most convincing in the entire movie.The essential problem is that this is a murder mystery which lacks any sense of mystery about it.  Right from the first we know who did it, and why he did it.  All the opportunities to achieve some suspense are thrown away.  Had Minerva, the spiritualist, actually contacted the murder victim in the graveyard, we might have been interested in her skills.  Had Williams' killing been presented from multiple perspectives, we might have been encouraged to wonder how it really happened.All the movie has left itself to ask us is ""When is a man justified in killing a drunken intruder in his own home?""  It's a legal question, a line drawn in sand, and it is not a question very interesting to the average moviegoer.  We want to explore the ambiguities of good and evil in the garden, but instead we get a brisk tour through a law book.Give us a mystery, strange characters with unfathomable powers, and a spooky Southern setting, and most anyone would rise to the bait.  Instead, this movie is so literal, so painfully blunt, about its potentially mysterious aspects that, well, it didn't ""Make my day,"" Clint.  Eastwood's own movie's have none of the subtlety that would be required to tell this story in movie form.  His past indicates no reason to expect that he could tell this story well, and he doesn't.To be fair, the book itself has some problems.  It starts out describing the colorful characters of Savannah.  Then there's a murder and suddenly the narrator, his beliefs and attitudes become the center of attention.  The reader is charmed by the local history lesson, intrigued by the quirky local characters, but ultimately bored by the murder, and confused by the shift in narrative perspective.  If the book is to be a murder mystery, then focus on the mystery.  If it is to be a character study, then stick with it.  If it's a travelogue about Savannah, then stay the course.  This does seem to be the one aspect of the book that sticks.  But why make the narrator, clearly a narrative figurehead at the beginning of the book, take front stage as the murder investigation emerges?  The first half of the book depicts a flat narrator.  The second half tries to give him angst, which comes along too late.Readers want to know what they are reading.  When the character studies run out, and both the murdered and the murderer prove uninteresting, the writer settles on the narrator and tries to make him work as the book's central focus.  Had a director used to dealing with the essential ambiguities of life taken up this script, he or she could have improved the book and focused attention earlier on something that would work.

I loved the languourous pacing of the whole thing.  The film takes its time showing us Savannah, its people, its character, and its dark side.  Kevin Spacey gives a performance that should have won an Oscar.  John Cusack is excellent as well, but the most surprising performance here goes to Jack Thompson as Spacey's lawyer.  Thompson is actually an Australian actor (who was in Breaker Morant years ago), yet he does the Southern style so well you'd think he was raised in Savannah.  The most intriguing performance, if you can call it that, goes to The Lady Chablis, an actual transvestite performer who resides in Savannah.  The scene where she goes to the cotillion is one of the best scenes in the entire film.  She has grace, dignity, and mystique, and Clint lets the camera linger on her.  Along with The Lady Chablis, Spacey's character is homosexual.  In Thompson's final argument during the murder trial, he talks about his client's homosexuality, but says if God thinks it's a sin, then God should judge it.  The generally positive portrayals of Spacey's character and Chablis show that a film can contain a message, yet be subtle about it and not hammer you over the head with it.  Most Hollywood films that have gay characters in them always have that ""tolerance"" speech in them, as if the viewer is an idiot (well, some viewers are) and has to have everything spoon fed to her or him.  Eastwood reportedly got some flack from right wing commentators over this film, primarily for his portrayal of the homosexual characters.  Eastwood has identified himself generally as a Republican, but he seems more of a libertarian than anything else.  Eastwood's films have always had digs at people who try and dictate your conduct (Bridges of Madison County has a powerful scene in a diner commenting on this), and this film is consistent with that point of view.  Some have argued that this film is a horrible adaptation of the book.

S. reading public, read and liked immensely John Berendt's MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL. I was positive that Clint Eastwood couldn't make a decent movie from the book. Seeing the film when it opened in 1997 didn't change my opinion. I was convinced the movie-- unlike the imaginary animal in the picture-- did walk on four legs. I recently viewed the movie again. Boy, was I wrong the first time. The movie has everything going for it. It is well shot although it would be impossible to make downtown Savannah ugly-- the soundtrack of Johnny Mercer standards is beautiful; the actors almost to a person are superb-- whether it's John Cusak as the straight Eastern journalist in town to write an article for ""Town and Country"" about the annual Christmas party of Jim Williams, played by Kevin Spacey, who actually looks like the wealthy antique dealer, or the Australian Jack Thompson as Williams' lawyer (who was quite wonderful as the sympathetic father of Russell Crowe in THE SUM OF US) or Lady Chablis who plays her booty-shaking self or Jude Law as the hustler Billy, before Law was known by almost everyone except some Oscar Night MC's.So the movie is not the book; from viewing the footage on this DVD of the ""real people in the Garden,"" I suspect that the book is not the people either. Mr. Eastwood concentrates for the most part on the murder of Billy and subsequent trial of Williams, condensing the four actual trials down to one, which makes for a tight, interesting plot.

It is a masterpiece that deserves all our attention. First of all it is a vision of the South, Savannah exactly, that is pure and absolute. The  accent, the gentility and the manners are all there. We get totally  immersed in a society that is so well behaved that it is pure pleasure.  But, second, we are in a society that is small and that has plenty of  secrets, and we are going to discover these secrets. The rich, the dominant  are hiding so many skeletons in their cupboards that they need to buy more  and more cupboards just to accomodate those skeletons. Sexual cupboards,  with gay and transvestites roaming around, known or unknown, but always  appreciated and regretted when one dies. And the survivors are ready to  accuse the killer of one of those of being a murderer, just because they  are in want, now the fruit of their thirst is dead. This is as strong, as  powerful as Faulkner. But, third, the whole accusation and the whole  defense are based on lies. The game in court is to find out the lie of the  other side and expose it. If you do, the jury will be on your side. The  prosecutor decides to reveal the sexuality of the accused, through a  witness, and it backfires because the witness reveals that he has that  sexuality too and hence is motivated by jealousy and want, the deceased  having been one of his lovers. But then the defense attacks, and out of  mere luck finds the lie of the police. This lie makes the accused innocent  of murder and sustains the selfdefense case. But the accused is lying and  the lie of the police has no value because the lie of the accused makes the  negligence of the police unsignificant. But no one knows the lie of the  accused. And yet this faulknerian situation is not finished. The blacks  have their role to play and they are socially on the fringe of this top  society, and yet they are the two hearts of it. The voodoo heart, that is  to say the detainers of the truth that all the dead take along with them  under the ground. And the genteel heart because the blacks retain the last  remnants of the past, of the polite and sophisticated society of old. The  whites sing the blues and the blacks dance the menuet. A whole faulknerian  symbol. This film is a must in our culture to understand how time is going  by and how the past remains present in our present, but through a  deplacement from one section of society to another, from the old top that  may still be the top to the old bottom that has attained some  respectability, from the whites to the blacks.",5,Christmas in the Deep South,959904000,"06 2, 2000",2000,2611,"['Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'rare', 'film', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'masterpiece', 'attention', 'First', 'vision', 'South', 'Savannah', 'exactly', 'pure', 'absolute', 'accent', 'gentility', 'manners', 'are', 'there', 'get', 'totally', 'immersed', 'society', 'so', 'well', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'second', 'are', 'society', 'small', 'plenty', 'secrets', 'are', 'going', 'discover', 'secrets', 'rich', 'dominant', 'are', 'hiding', 'so', 'many', 'skeletons', 'cupboards', 'need', 'buy', 'more', 'more', 'cupboards', 'just', 'accomodate', 'skeletons', 'Sexual', 'cupboards', 'gay', 'roaming', 'around', 'known', 'unknown', 'always', 'appreciated', 'regretted', 'when', 'one', 'survivors', 'are', 'ready', 'accuse', 'killer', 'one', 'being', 'murderer', 'just', 'are', 'want', 'now', 'fruit', 'thirst', 'dead', 'strong', 'as', 'powerful', 'Faulkner', 'third', 'whole', 'accusation', 'whole', 'defense', 'are', 'based', 'lies', 'game', 'court', 'find', 'out', 'lie', 'other', 'side', 'expose', 'do', 'jury', 'will', 'be', 'side', 'prosecutor', 'reveal', 'sexuality', 'accused', 'witness', 'witness', 'reveals', 'sexuality', 'too', 'hence', 'motivated', 'jealousy', 'want', 'deceased', 'having', 'been', 'one', 'lovers', 'then', 'defense', 'attacks', 'mere', 'luck', 'lie', 'police', 'lie', 'accused', 'innocent', 'murder', 'selfdefense', 'case', 'accused', 'lying', 'lie', 'police', 'value', 'lie', 'accused', 'negligence', 'police', 'unsignificant', 'one', 'lie', 'accused', 'yet', 'faulknerian', 'situation', 'not', 'finished', 'blacks', 'have', 'role', 'play', 'are', 'socially', 'fringe', 'top', 'society', 'yet', 'are', 'two', 'hearts', 'voodoo', 'heart', 'say', 'detainers', 'truth', 'dead', 'take', 'ground', 'genteel', 'heart', 'blacks', 'retain', 'last', 'remnants', 'past', 'polite', 'sophisticated', 'society', 'old', 'whites', 'sing', 'blues', 'blacks', 'dance', 'menuet', 'whole', 'faulknerian', 'symbol', 'film', 'must', 'culture', 'understand', 'how', 'time', 'going', 'how', 'past', 'present', 'present', 'deplacement', 'one', 'section', 'society', 'old', 'top', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'top', 'old', 'bottom', 'attained', 'respectability', 'whites', 'blacks']",N/A

John Berendt wisely focused on the people, more so than the events, to craft an engrossing, magical tale.Somehow, the film lost all the charm of the book. For starters, the trial is condensed into a single trial, whereas in reality it was stretched out over several trials and years. The murder, while it was discussed throughout the book, was also not the focus of the book. In the film it becomes the focal point and the movie just seems to turn into a bad murder mystery (without too much mystery) as a result.A primarily problem: the book's charm was derived largely from the disparate lives presented. The movie only touches upon most of the different characters in a cursory manner and none of the magic and air of mystery about Savannah is translated to the screen.With all the talent tied to this project, it should have been a blockbuster.

The murder of a young man by a Savannah, Georgia socialite and art collector John Williams portrayed by actor Kevin Spacey took place in the early 1980's and was a BIG scandal among Savannah's elite .  The story began when Kelso is sent to Savannah to cover an annual Christmas party thrown by Williams.  Kelso is very impressed with the beauty and ""old south"" charm and architecture of Savannah (in many ways a lot like her sister city Charleston, SC).  He finds the people eccentric but fascinating, and everything is normal until he is woken up in the middle of the night by a murder.  Williams is accused of murdering his young but wild and crazy lover portrayed in the movie by Jude Law.  Kelso then shifts to covering the trial and receives a lot of inside information about the accused and the victim due to him becoming friends with Williams and the Savannah Social circle.  As the movie goes on, you see Kelso interviewing and becoming friends with a wide variety of people.  From a ""Drag Queen"" to the lawyer who is defending Williams to a Voo Doo PriestessAlso, Kelso begins a romance with a singer and local who knew Williams portrayed in the movie by Clint Eastwood's beautiful daughter Alison Eastwood.  The trial begins and it is an interesting one at that.  Did Williams actually kill his loverin self defense?  Or did he just want the troubled young man to go away permanently?  There is also an air of the ""supernatural"" when the voodoo priestess named ""Minerva"" speaks to the dead young man and he is bent on revenge.  One of the last scenes in the movie takes the supernatural twist when you see the young male lover ""get his revenge"".This is an excellent movie and I like it better than the novel (which is quite rare for me).

The book is long and in-depth, non-fiction yet written in a fiction-type narrative. Eastwood changed the main character (who is the author of the book) omitted some others, added some others and changed the timeline of events (which is a bit confusing for readers of the book, as there were multiple trials and I believe it took place over 7-8 years instead of a truncated several months as the movie seems to imply).Cusack is great. Eastwood's daughter is okay, but she seemed to be outmatched by more known actors. Kevin Spacey excelled as he always did and even Jude Law, though minor, exuded enough in his scenes to be noticed.

That never seems to happen, just the other way around, like in this case where John Cusack plays a society reporter who in the book was certainly more drawn to covering the waterfront.  He's been summoned to Savannah to write a puff piece for a lifestyle magazine on Jim Williams, the society dandy who has built up some rundown parts of Savannah and restored one of the most beautiful ante-bellum mansions, the Mercer House (built for the great-grandfather of songwriter Johnny Mercer).Director Eastwood punctuates the Christmas-sy Savannah backdrop with some of Mercer's loveliest compositions, delivered in some jazzy renditions.  Mercer is often thought of as the ""poet of Tin Pan Alley,"" and his lyrics have the soft thickness of the best American poetry of the first half of the 20th century.  (The poet Conrad Aiken was a friend and mentor.)  He wrote the lyrics for MOON RIVER, for example, as well as many lyrics whose internal rhymes and puns spin them to the brim of sense-a controlled madness, which Eastwood apes in his compositions, balancing the mad eccentrics of Savannah with the Apollonian neatness and classicism of the courtroom and the legal system.When Jim Williams kills a no-good boyfriend at Christmastime, the whole town picks up talking just as they've been talking for 100 years about outsiders and insiders.Kevin Spacey, as Jim, takes on a daring role.  Was he worried that people would think he himself was gay?  Or was this a complex double bluff to take the edge off people's suspicions and preconceptions about him?  He seems to be playing all the angles as he figures as defendant in one of the biggest trials ever to hit the state of Georgia.  John Cusack finds eros with a young jazz singer played by Alison Eastwood, the director's daughter, who functions in this film roughly as Asia Argento functions in the films of HER father-as a surrogate leading lady, when no such animal existed in the book.  Still she's wedged in there, and her natural style of acting goes down smooth, like the blonde in her hair.  She's irresistible, and I'm only sorry the picture did so badly at the box office, for I would have liked to have seen her and John Cusack re-teamed again and again, as the old MGM bosses would re-team William Powell and Myrna Loy, for we go to the movies for many reasons, but chief among them is to witness sparks.With Lady Chablis, who's not a patch on the drag queens I've known here in SF and in New York.

The movie is the adaptation of John Berendt's best selling semi-fictionalized expose of the city of Savannah and the sensational 1981 murder of Danny Hansford (Billy Hanson in the movie) by his employer/lover Jim Williams, a wealthy antique collector and historical preservationist.  In adapting the story to film, changes naturally had to be made that would make the story more tolerable and understandable to the moviegoer, and anyone who has read the book will know that unfortunately, a fair bit had to be compromised as a result.  This is not to say that the adaptation is ""off"" or that the movie is poor; the movie on its own is quite good, and one has to admit that a fair effort was made to incorporate many of the quirky elements of  the original story into the plot.  Still, much was left out, so much so that at times there are seens where ambiguous statements and references are made, which if one had not read the book would not quite understand why the character says or does what they say and do.  So really, in order to fully appreciate the movie, one must have read the book.The casting for the movie is excellent.  Spacey is quite convincing as the central character Jim Williams, the  antiques deal who guns down Billy Hanson  following his annual Christmas party.  Cusak also does a commendable job as John Kelso, the New York writer sent down to cover William's Christmas Party and who subsequently finds himself very much involved in uncovering the truth of what happened the night of the shooting.  The performance that I enjoyed most, however, was that of Paul Hipp, who played the characted of Joe Odom, a former lawyer turned musician whose social and business exploits are unfortunately not developed to any great extent in the movie.  His disappearance from the plot halfway through the movie is also somewhat disappointing.  And lastly, although I was a little miffed by the love-story element added to the film version, the role of Mandy was also well played by the director's daughter.One interesting aspect of the movie was the casting of some of the original characters in the story.  Most notable is, of course, that of The Lady Chablis who plays a somewhat more restrained version of herself .  Sonny Seiler, the famous owner of the University of Georgia mascot UGA, who was originally a member of Williams' defense team, plays the judge.  Two others who make brief appearances are Jerry the hairdresser mentioned briefly in the book  and the recently deceased Emma Kelly, the Lady of Six Thousand Songs.The DVD version of course includes added ""features""  but in this case they are not all that extensive.  They do, however, provide those unfamiliar with the orginal story a little bit of background on the characters and places in the movie.",4,An enjoyable and entertaining adaptation.,1026864000,"07 17, 2002",2002,2996,"['Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'much', 'fact', 'have', 'yet', 'tire', 'watching', 'numerous', 'times', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'John', 'Berendt', 'best', 'selling', 'semi-fictionalized', 'expose', 'city', 'Savannah', 'sensational', '1981', 'murder', 'Danny', 'Hansford', 'Billy', 'Hanson', 'movie', 'employer/lover', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'wealthy', 'antique', 'collector', 'historical', 'preservationist', 'adapting', 'story', 'film', 'changes', 'naturally', 'had', 'be', 'made', 'would', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'tolerable', 'understandable', 'moviegoer', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'know', 'unfortunately', 'fair', 'bit', 'had', 'be', 'compromised', 'result', 'not', 'say', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'poor', 'movie', 'own', 'quite', 'good', 'one', 'admit', 'fair', 'effort', 'was', 'made', 'incorporate', 'many', 'quirky', 'elements', 'original', 'story', 'plot', 'Still', 'much', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'that', 'times', 'are', 'seens', 'where', 'ambiguous', 'statements', 'references', 'are', 'made', 'one', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'not', 'quite', 'understand', 'why', 'character', 'what', 'say', 'do', 'So', 'really', 'order', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'one', 'must', 'have', 'read', 'book.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'excellent', 'Spacey', 'quite', 'convincing', 'central', 'character', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'antiques', 'deal', 'who', 'guns', 'down', 'Billy', 'Hanson', 'following', 'annual', 'Christmas', 'party', 'Cusak', 'also', 'commendable', 'job', 'John', 'Kelso', 'New', 'York', 'writer', 'sent', 'down', 'cover', 'William', 'Christmas', 'Party', 'who', 'subsequently', 'very', 'much', 'involved', 'uncovering', 'truth', 'what', 'happened', 'night', 'shooting', 'performance', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'however', 'was', 'Paul', 'Hipp', 'who', 'played', 'characted', 'Joe', 'Odom', 'former', 'lawyer', 'turned', 'musician', 'social', 'business', 'exploits', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'developed', 'great', 'extent', 'movie', 'disappearance', 'plot', 'halfway', 'movie', 'also', 'somewhat', 'disappointing', 'lastly', 'was', 'little', 'miffed', 'love-story', 'element', 'added', 'film', 'version', 'role', 'Mandy', 'was', 'also', 'well', 'played', 'director', 'daughter.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'movie', 'was', 'casting', 'original', 'characters', 'story', 'Most', 'notable', 'course', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'who', 'somewhat', 'more', 'restrained', 'version', 'herself', 'Sonny', 'Seiler', 'famous', 'owner', 'University', 'Georgia', 'mascot', 'UGA', 'who', 'was', 'originally', 'member', 'Williams', 'defense', 'team', 'judge', 'Two', 'others', 'who', 'make', 'brief', 'appearances', 'are', 'Jerry', 'hairdresser', 'mentioned', 'briefly', 'book', 'recently', 'deceased', 'Emma', 'Kelly', 'Lady', 'Six', 'Thousand', 'Songs.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'course', 'added', 'features', 'case', 'are', 'not', 'extensive', 'do', 'however', 'provide', 'unfamiliar', 'orginal', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'background', 'characters', 'places', 'movie']",N/A

There's not a lot of doubt what the ultimate verdict will be, but there are many vignettes that are worth the price of admission, and the end is a bit of a shocker.And of course, Eastwood being a jazz buff, he included a tribute to Johnny Mercer, who was from Savannah.

Perhaps a successful book. After Billy Hanson, the local hustler, played by a very young looking Jude Law, is murdered Kelso knows there is. As he begins to research his main character, Jim Williams, he learns the true character of his subject and the people he has called his friends. It's amazing what happens to southern hospitality when someone's sexuality is brought to the forefront of a murder trial.This was such a great movie. Filled with colourful southern characters, lead by the fantastic Spacey. Not surprisingly Cusack's character moves the story along but my absolute favourite was the sweet Lady Chablis (Chablis Deveau) a.k.a. Frank, a lounge singer with attitude, a hidden package and a keen sense of wit. She really steals the show.Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is loosely based on the successful novel of the same name by John Berendt and is directed by Clint Eastwood.

103357,ADOSOJ9HJAHDU,0790734680,"M.M. ""Muppet Fan""","[17, 17]","There were two reasons why I picked up this film: 1.) Kevin Spacey and 2.) it takes place in Savannah, GA, which is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited.  I knew very little about the story; I knew that it had  something to do with a murder, and that no one could figure out if the rich  man (Spacey) had killed him or not.  I found out later that it was in fact  a true story, which made it even more intriguing.  However, I feel that the  heart of this movie lies not in the murder mystery itself, but in the  eccentric characters who occupy the city of Savannah.  John Cusack as an  outsider becomes a representation of the audience, someone who stumbles  along and slowly comes to appreciate the many different people of the city.  The audience is taken on a whirlwind tour of some of the most interesting  and odd people to exist in the South.  I especially loved the Lady Chablis;  that character is too melodramatic and amusing for words.  In addition to  the interesting characters, there is the great music of Savannah's Johnny  Mercer, which really adds to the authenticity of the piece. As a director,  Clint Eastwood has a gift for capturing the heart and spirit of the city on  film.  However, he still needs to learn a thing or two about storytelling.  For one thing, the movie is way too long; they try to fit too much into the  story, making it at times jumbled and incoherent. I found myself losing  interest a couple of times, especially when Spacey's character was brought  to trial. That trial dragged on forever!  The ending didn't make any sense,  either.  Despite these discrepancies, I have viewed the film a number of  times, and I have concluded that you either have to be a huge Kevin Spacey  fan, or else you really have to like the scenery and music to sit through  it more than once.",4,"Good music, good scenery, but very long movie",945302400,"12 16, 1999",1999,1829,"['were', 'two', 'reasons', 'why', 'picked', 'up', 'film', '1', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', '2', 'place', 'Savannah', 'GA', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'have', 'ever', 'visited', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'story', 'knew', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'murder', 'one', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'rich', 'man', 'Spacey', 'had', 'killed', 'not', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'was', 'fact', 'true', 'story', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'intriguing', 'However', 'feel', 'heart', 'movie', 'not', 'murder', 'mystery', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'who', 'occupy', 'city', 'Savannah', 'John', 'Cusack', 'outsider', 'representation', 'audience', 'someone', 'who', 'along', 'slowly', 'appreciate', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'city', 'audience', 'taken', 'whirlwind', 'tour', 'most', 'interesting', 'odd', 'people', 'exist', 'South', 'especially', 'loved', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'character', 'too', 'melodramatic', 'amusing', 'words', 'addition', 'interesting', 'characters', 'great', 'music', 'Savannah', 'Johnny', 'Mercer', 'really', 'authenticity', 'piece', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'gift', 'capturing', 'heart', 'spirit', 'city', 'film', 'However', 'still', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'storytelling', 'one', 'thing', 'movie', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'try', 'fit', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'making', 'times', 'jumbled', 'incoherent', 'found', 'losing', 'interest', 'couple', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'Spacey', 'character', 'was', 'brought', 'trial', 'trial', 'dragged', 'forever', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'discrepancies', 'have', 'viewed', 'film', 'number', 'times', 'have', 'concluded', 'have', 'be', 'huge', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fan', 'else', 'really', 'have', 'like', 'scenery', 'music', 'sit', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Is it a murder-mystery? A romantic comedy? A courtroom drama? A funloving adventure into a surreal southern landscape? A dark medication on the nature of the truth?Honestly, it's all of these things, and it does most of them pretty well. The problem is, you never really get a sense for what the core issue or conflict is. So when the film ends, it veers in a direction that the previous 2 hours and 15 minutes really didn't prep you for, and personally I felt like it was a little contrived.The core of the movie is a murder/investigation/trial, and most of that was material I enjoyed. The problem is, Midnight... crams so many subplots and divergences into the story that everything feels sort of wattered down and left this viewer unsatisfied.I suspect that a sprawling, scattershot look at Savannah, Georgia might be pretty darn interesting, but as a movie it felt overlong, logically inconsistent and frankly a little boring.

Sure Clint Eastwood as any director knows all too well, simply had to take some creative license if this fascinating and true story was to translate well to film.  He did good.  To Mr. Eastwood's credit, not a few of the many characters seen on screen were the real deal as the murder trial of noveau riche antique dealer Jim Williams unfolded.  Kevin Spacey as Williams nailed this one, right down to the piercing dark eyes as noted in the best selling book of the same name by John Berendt. As good as Spacey's performance was, this intriguing story is carried along on the strength of an unusual and fact based cast of characters, a few of the minor ones in William's circle actually play themselves including a cameo by William's real life sister.  Part of the fun of watching this movie is sorting out the real characters from the actors. John Cusack's role as a writer for an upscale magazine was an understandable, even essential fabrication to tie the events together with some dramatic continuity. How many people noticed Cusack's sister Ann in a brief walk-on appearance? But I digress.  One character that stands out, and I mean really stands out is Lady Chablis. If you watch this movie for no other reason, watch it to witness this highly unusual and sometimes hilarious real life personality who as a local entertainer still resided in the Savannah, Georgia area at the time of the DVD release. There had to be little doubt in director Clint Eastwood's mind that Lady Chablis could only be played by the real Lady Chablis. Eastwood's beautiful daughter Alison played a supporting role as love interest to Cusack's writer and this device worked fairly well, though differing from her real life counterpart in some significant ways.  Review the informative and interactive DVD and judge for yourself if Eastwood captured  the essence of the story.  I think he did.  Of course the book is more accurate, it has all the time it needs to, but all told Eastwood did a very good job from the director's chair and probably did more to promote tourism to beautiful and historic Savannah than the best efforts of an army of civic boosters.",4,Wonderfully Eccentric,1056326400,"06 23, 2003",2003,2279,"['What', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'discover', 'much', 'what', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Midnight', 'Garden', 'Good', 'Evil', 'essentially', 'true', 'Sure', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'director', 'too', 'well', 'simply', 'had', 'take', 'creative', 'license', 'fascinating', 'true', 'story', 'was', 'translate', 'well', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'Mr.', 'Eastwood', 'credit', 'not', 'few', 'many', 'characters', 'seen', 'screen', 'were', 'real', 'deal', 'murder', 'trial', 'noveau', 'riche', 'antique', 'dealer', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'unfolded', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Williams', 'nailed', 'one', 'right', 'down', 'piercing', 'dark', 'eyes', 'noted', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'John', 'Berendt', 'As', 'good', 'Spacey', 'performance', 'was', 'intriguing', 'story', 'carried', 'strength', 'unusual', 'fact', 'based', 'cast', 'characters', 'few', 'minor', 'ones', 'William', 'circle', 'actually', 'play', 'including', 'cameo', 'William', 'real', 'life', 'sister', 'Part', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'sorting', 'out', 'real', 'characters', 'actors', 'John', 'Cusack', 'role', 'writer', 'upscale', 'magazine', 'was', 'understandable', 'even', 'essential', 'fabrication', 'tie', 'events', 'together', 'dramatic', 'continuity', 'How', 'many', 'people', 'noticed', 'Cusack', 'sister', 'Ann', 'brief', 'walk-on', 'appearance', 'digress', 'One', 'character', 'out', 'mean', 'really', 'out', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'watch', 'movie', 'other', 'reason', 'watch', 'witness', 'highly', 'unusual', 'sometimes', 'hilarious', 'real', 'life', 'personality', 'who', 'local', 'entertainer', 'still', 'resided', 'Savannah', 'Georgia', 'area', 'time', 'DVD', 'release', 'had', 'be', 'little', 'doubt', 'director', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'mind', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'played', 'real', 'Lady', 'Chablis', 'Eastwood', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Alison', 'played', 'supporting', 'role', 'love', 'interest', 'Cusack', 'writer', 'device', 'worked', 'fairly', 'well', 'differing', 'real', 'life', 'counterpart', 'significant', 'ways', 'Review', 'informative', 'interactive', 'DVD', 'judge', 'Eastwood', 'captured', 'essence', 'story', 'think', 'did', 'course', 'book', 'more', 'accurate', 'time', 'told', 'Eastwood', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'director', 'chair', 'probably', 'did', 'more', 'promote', 'tourism', 'beautiful', 'historic', 'Savannah', 'best', 'efforts', 'army', 'civic', 'boosters']",N/A

of the same name,which appeared on the New York Time's bestseller list for over 200 hundred days.Like most adaptions from book to film this one is not a true recreation by any stretch,however director Eastwood manages to create a wonderful,one might say,southern gothic-like atmoshpere which slowly but surely draws the viewer in,as character after character colourfully fills in his visual canvas.The story involves a wanna be author John Kelso(John Cusak)who goes to Savannah,Georgia on commission from a magazine similar in nature to Better Homes and Gardens.His purpose is to do a 500 word article on the home and annual famous soiree given by local Jim Williams(Kevin Spacey).Mr.Williams is a very influential,rich but affable man with apparently a very large base of friends.Kelso attends said party and leaves but later that night he is awakened by the sounds of police car sirens.It seems Mr.Williams has shot one Billy Hanson(Jude Law),a ""handyman"" who he employs.Coincidentally Kelso had been witness to a verbal altercation Williams had had with Hanson during the party.Williams is arrested and tells a story of self defense.The subsequent trial reveals many sordid details not only of Hanson but of Williams himself.It seems Hanson's relationship with Williams,and with others,was more than platonic.As things drag on the defence seems to be getting pushed into a corner until Kelso uncovers some incriminating evidence at the hospital,which ultimately the defence will use to exonerate him.However before William's lawyer shows up to tell his client the good news,Williams and Kelso have a heart to heart in which Williams says he killed Hanson,but not quite in the self defence manner he previously was adhering to.Kelso is taken aback but when the lawyer shows up Williams reverts back to his old story.The ""not guilty"" verdict is a slam dunk.Now free Kelso and Williams meet one last time at his home.As he leaves Kelso asks him what the real story was.Williams replies""Truth,like art,is in the eye of the beholder"".After he leaves Williams has a heart attack and falls to the floor dead.After the funeral Kelso decides to remain in Savannah to write a book on the incident.This film is chock full of colourful characters that one might find in Huckleberry Fin or To Kill a Mockingbird.Along with Williams southern affability we have Lady Chablis(Chablis Deaveau),a drag queen in real life,who provides most of the films most amusing moments,usually in tandem with John Cusack.Australian actor(!)Jack Thompson is Williams rotund,easy going,good old boy stereo-typical southern lawyer-friend.Clint's daughter Allsion plays a local called Mandy,who comes in and out of the proceedings but projects a wonderful laid back but sex-tinged aura.Clint draws on one of his more well known and used stable of actors from many of his other films in Geoffrey Lewis.He plays a very eccentric local who walks around with horse flies attached to strings and a bottle of poison water which everyone thinks he might one day spoil the local water supply with.Irma Hall plays with wonderful relish,a local voodoo woman called Minerva that Williams uses and also is seen constantly throughout keeping it all good with the spirit world.It is these and others that inhabit this portrayal of old Savannah,its culture(its' famous musical son Johnny Mercer is given on screen mention along with his music),its people and its flavour that makes this such an appealing drama/film.And Clint does a masterful job immersing us in that atmosphere.Techincally speaking,though there is no indication it has been remastered,Waners seems to have at least struck a new print as the picture is quite clean and crisp.And although the blurb for this film on Amazon sites lists this movie in widescreen AND full screen,it is ONLY in widescreen.It has many special features including an interactive tour of Savannah,featurettes on the cast and the characters in the book and film along with the trailer.All in all a very good and recommended tale of the old card game of deception and truth in the old south,specifically Savannah,Georgia.You can almost smell those magnolia blossoms,taste that cool ice tea and feel the humidity all around.",4,"""Truth,like art,is in the eye of the beholder""-4 1/2 stars.",1282435200,"08 22, 2010",2010,4551,"['have', 'had', 'film', 'desk', 'review',

I made the mistake of reading the book first and put off seeing the movie because Hollywood usually spins off into an unrecognizable &#34;celebrity impersonator&#34;..and sure enough they emphasized characters I would have only mentioned in passing and left out whole segments of Savannah's rich (in character, foibles and yes, money) citizens. I saw no need for the &#34;love interest&#34; that was slipped in under the guise of &#34;artistic license&#34; (or maybe to give the Director's daughter a chance to act).  The real story was far more intriguing.. four actual trials and the acquitted &#34;hero&#34; of the story dying 6 months after it was over.  I know they felt it would probably have made the movie 4 hours long, but they could have cut out some of the character fluff. John Cusack was great, found myself caught up with his being caught up, Jude Law, not so much as a James Dean Southern Boy.

I used to hang out at the clubs, parks, Greyhound Station and cemetery during my overnight layovers when I was a Train Attendant on Amtrak's ""Palmetto"" from Washington, DC to Savannah in the late 80's and early 90's. There was an active male prostitute and drug business in the beautiful squares after dark. Drunk students from the art college weaved in and out of the downtown clubs and gangs of horny black gay brothers were always cruising about. The best bar-b-q and fried fish were sold at a greasy spoon near the Howard Johnson Lodge where the train crew stayed...and the naughty projects were close by. I was devastated when a new contract moved us out of the city into a highway motel catering to truckers. At least there was a Piggly Wiggly Supermarket - which taxed grits and grocery - in a nearby strip mall. I used to jog through another housing project across the street.Many of the scenes in this movie are familiar, but there should have been more - like SCAD and the old Central of Georgia train station which hosted the legendary ""Nancy Hanks"" streamliner Miss Charlotte rode to and from Atlanta. I can just see her sipping a mint julep in the all-white segregated parlour car as the train breeezes by black bodies hanging from the poplar trees. Savannah - like Charleston and New Orleans - is a true Southern Belle.Is Kevin Spacey gay? Spacey looks and acts so much like his gay character (Jim Williams) that my gaydar blows up during all his scenes. Jim's eyes light up like a Christmas tree whenever John Cusack appears. Is Spacey merely in character or is he simply overcome by Cusack's boyish beauty? Cusack is no great actor but he possesses a cute baby face and a matin&eacute;e idol appeal that celebrity worshipers adore. His naive appeal obviously turns Lady Chablis on.

It  makes us look like a bunch of gun-and-liquor crazed charming urban  socialites, but still, it's a departure from the expected. The film IS too  long, and they probably use The Lady Chablis a bit too much, a choice the  director probably found irresistible beacuse s/he steals every scene s/he  is in. My favorite character, the &quot;cheerfully amoral&quot; Joe Odom,  (played magnificently by Paul Hipp) wasn't used enough, although he DOES  get the movie's best one liner--when a sleepy Kelso (John Cusack) askes why  all the police cars are in the street--&quot;Jim Williams' done gone and  shot somebody--canape'?&quot; Every southern town has a least one Joe Odom.  And Kevin Spacey's performance is of course perfect in every possible way,  in a role that was quite a challenge. Jude Law as the victim/boy hustler  Billy doesn't get much of a chance to make an impression, and if one had  only seen the film one might wonder what James and everyone else saw in  this bad boy. Disappointing, because one assumes Eastwood would know all  about how to make a character appear both sexy AND dangerous.  Law's Billy  is more of a stock criminal than anything else. And Eastwood apparently  cast his daughter as Mandy--well, she's not THAT bad....

The story is an interesting one set in a slow Southern Gothic pace, and there is in addition the wonderful Johnny Mercer song ""Skylark"" which is played at the beginning and at the end. I think the character of Savannah is brought out in the film in many ways: the walks in the park, the Mercer house, the identical scenes at beginning and end in which Minerva feeds a squirrel sitting on a park bench as the plane arrives overhead. Not to mention that voodoo is part of Savannah's ambience. Plus there are wonderful humorous interludes: the man walking the invisible dog, the man who carries flies on pieces of string and threatens to empty a bottle of toxic poison into the city's water supply; the ladies bridge society. The best individual performance is probably by Kevin Spacey followed closely by Minerva, Lady Chablis, Williams' lawyer, and the narrator and his girlfriend Mandy.

It's distinctly one of those ""Read the book""-type movies where the lovely storytelling got lost in the translation. In the book, there was much more of a story than in the movie - the evocative descriptions lushly accented what was basically a courtroom drama. But perhaps it was too lengthy of a story to be told on film. The fact of the matter is that there really isn't that much of a story at all. While the colorful characters come alive on the page, in the movie, they camouflage a threadbare script. Perhaps it was just a poor choice for Eastwood's directorial abilities, or perhaps it was a poor choice for a screenplay - there are many flaws that nag and distract throughout. What does not distract is the art direction, which is one of the stars of the film. The interiors and exteriors, in their natural setting of Savannah, are glimmering jewels (so lovingly created in the book), and they, too, help hide the unmentionable script problem. So lovely are they that one wishes to see more of them, and might be just as happy with a travelogue where all that messy plot stuff doesn't interfere. John Cusak is an amiable enough actor, playing the role of the reporter John Kelso, who is assigned by *Town & Country* magazine to cover one of Jim Williams' legendary Christmas parties. Right off the bat, the story's famous characters start making their appearances, and they are all well-cast. In fact, the entire movie is well-cast, with a minor exception of Jude Law who is a fish out of water as the rough trade bad-boy (and Williams' erstwhile lover), Billy Hanson. Law is talented, but was not rough enough looking for the small role, and never, ever approached believability as the hard-drinking, small-time drug-dealing boho Southern ""trade."" The use of Savannah locals, sometimes playing themselves, is clever and entertaining. Lady Chablis, a local drag entertainer, has her moment in the sun playing herself - a screamingly funny pre-op transsexual whose relation to the actual story is very slim. She does, however, manage to get a large share of screentime, including the funniest scene in the movie when she crashes the cotillion for black debutantes. Jack Thompson makes us utterly forget his Aussie background as he brilliantly recreates the role of attorney Sonny Seiler. The cleverest casting twist was using the *real* Sonny Seiler to play the judge. Irma P. Hall, as voodoo practitioner Minerva, makes the most of her role as the manager of the spirits of the dead, even if the role is one of the most troublesome, scriptwise, in the whole movie.

In the end, the jury acquits the accused, but the accused also reveals that he had actually lied about the murder.I have a hard time figuring out the point (and genre) of the story. All along, we are pulled along to root for a court room drama that seems on path to being about overcoming small town prejudice to free an innocent man. But then at the end the man's innocence is put in question. So the resolution feels weird. The town is also weird (which seems to be a part of the story). The community is a closeted bunch of fruitcakes ruled by gossip and prejudice. The movie paints a vivid picture of the community's weirdness, but how does that serve the point of the story?I don't get it.And the genre is a little weird. If its a courtroom drama, then hard evidence should rule the day. If it's about the ambiguous nature of good and evil and the hidden powers of fate and voodoo on our lives, then fate and consequence should rule the day. I don't think you can mix them. The court room drama and hard evidence is what takes up screen time and pulls our attention forward, but then the climax switches the focus to the good/evil ambiguity and the sense that you get what you deserve by divine retribution. So we go along for one ride (Courtroom Drama) and finish on a different ride at the end (Good/Evil Contemplation/Fate). Makes me feel weird about the ticket I purchased at the beginning.A specific example is: the photographer took pictures of the crime scene and handed it to our protagonist. In a Courtroom Drama these types of actions should have consequences later (maybe he develops the film to find a clue). But it didn't happen. So the Genre is busted. We devoted a good portion of attention in the first half of the movie being sensitive to these clues in the story, but there is no payoff.

103418,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0790734680,Themis-Athena,"[100, 108]","Adapting a book to the screen is always a risk, and adapting a successful book particularly so, especially if it is a nonfiction book and the story has already made news (or been the subject of gossip, which in this instance doesn't seem to make much difference) long before the book was ever written.  There will always be those who claim that you didn't do the book justice, or that you didn't do the real events justice, or both.  But let's face it, folks, the vast majority of us weren't witnesses to Jim Williams's record four trials, nor did we attend any of his famous Christmas parties, nor did or do we know Mr. Williams or any of the other inhabitants of Savannah featured so prominently here (even if Jerry Spence - not the attorney, the hairdresser appearing as himself in the movie - insists that ever since the publication of John Behrendt's book people have been asking him to sign their copy).  All that most of us did was read the book ... yes, so did I, and I enjoyed it immensely.  And maybe some have taken a trip to Savannah and gone on one of those ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" bus tours.  (No, haven't done that myself yet.  Savannah's on my list, though.)Granted, condensing four trials into one, adding a fictional reporter (John Kelso alias John Cusack) as a stand-in for Mr. Behrendt whose book is a first-person account, and making Mandy Nichols (director Clint Eastwood's daughter Alison) the reporter's love interest, meant altering the facts as related in the book.  But let's not forget that the latter covers a period of eight-plus years and is jam-packed with a shooting, four trials, a host of social events and a cast of more memorable characters than many a novel; all of which is near impossible to transform into a movie if you neither want to skip over half the important details and move the action at breakneck speed, nor turn the project into a ten-part TV series.  These changes were probably necessary byproducts of the screenwriting process.  But the core elements of the story have been maintained, and apart from the relationship between Mandy and John Kelso/John Behrendt, the cast of main characters strikes me as pretty faithful to the book.Most importantly, the person at the center of the story: antiques dealer, art lover, restorer of historic mansions and sun of Savannah's genteel society, Jim Williams, is exactly the kind of man you imagine after having read the book - portrayed by Kevin Spacey with all the charm, grace and slightly condescending noblesse you would expect from a textbook Southern gentleman, with that ""coastal accent ... soft and slurring, liquid of vowels, kind to consonants"" as John Behrendt writes, quoting ""Gone With the Wind;"" making you forget that neither Mr. Williams actually came from ""old money,"" nor Kevin Spacey grew up south of the Mason-Dixon line.  And Savannah, of course, is Savannah ... city of grand old mansions surrounding its 21 squares, cotillon balls (including a black one), a Married Women's (Card) Club, lush vegetation, shady trees, Spanish moss and sultry heat radiating from the pages of John Behrendt's book as much as it does from the movie screen in director Clint Eastwood's interpretation.  The movie was shot on location, including and in particular in and around Williams's Mercer House, on Monterey Square and in Bonaventure and Beaufort Cemeteries; giving it that feeling of authenticity which is virtually impossible to replicate in a studio.  In addition, almost all of the Savannah residents vital to the story readily participated in screen tests; with the glamorous Lady Chablis (in all her eccentricity more lady than many a born one, Southern or otherwise) emerging in a starring role and Williams's attorney Sonny Seiler portraying the trial judge.  Even bulldog Uga, the famed mascot of the University of Georgia's football team, traditionally provided by the Seiler family and as important a member of Savannah society as all its human residents and as Patrick, the long-deceased dog still symbolically being walked by its former caregiver, was not left out ... with the minor imperfection that because Uga IV, the star of the book and the real events it describes had already followed his ancestors Uga I - III to dog heaven when the movie was shot, he had to be portrayed by his son, Uga V.  And more authenticity is added by the use of several songs written by Johnny Mercer, Savannah's famous son and great-grandson of the general who built the mansion restored and inhabited by Jim Williams.Clint Eastwood's direction evokes an only marginally modernized version of the ""old South"" most of which could have come straight out of a book by Faulkner or Tennessee Williams; with an eye for the atmosphere and intricacies of the place and its people that comes as a surprise only to those who merely know the one-term mayor of Carmel, CA as Dirty Harry or the Man With No Name, not as the director of ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" like this movie a book adaptation (although set in quite a different environment).  And in this approach, he proves as faithful to John Behrendt's book as in the movie's depiction of Jim Williams and his fellow Savannahians:  What on the surface is the chronicle of the trial of a prominent and rather colorful member of society for the death of a wayward, hot-tempered street hustler who happened to be his sometime lover (and that of most of Savannah's society, both male and female), is truly a complex, beautifully shot portrayal of the city itself and its people; like in the book, the events as such are merely a vehicle to put into pictures what Eastwood was interested in most.  Yet, the movie should first and foremost be taken at face value; it is more than just another book adaptation and in its dignified beauty, easily stands on its own two feet.Also recommended:Midnight

John Kelso a magazine reporter finds himself in Savannah amid the beautiful architecture and odd doings to write a feature on one of William's famous Christmas parties. He is intrigued by Williams from the start, but his curiosity is piqued when he meets Jim's violent, young and sexy lover, Billy. Later that night, Billy is dead, and Kelso stays on to cover the murder trial.

At the time, I found it to be a very strange and bizarre movie, but one that was also fascinating. It captured my imagination. After finally being able to read the book that the film is based upon, I re-watched the movie again. After having read the book, my impressions of the film didn't change much. I was a little bit disappointed that some of the best characters from the book were compressed or totally deleted, but other than that I felt that the movie stayed close to the spirit of the book.MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL examines a famous murder trial that took place in Savannah, Georgia. The movie revolves around the murder trial, but really isn't about murder at all. Instead, the trial serves as a backdrop for the character study that the film really is. The movie also illustrates a community of people living together in a city that operates more as a family rather than a socialized living environment.MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL was directed by Clint Eastwood and in my opinion, it is one of the best films he has ever directed (so much better and more interesting than the ballyhooed MYSTIC RIVER).  The movie is filled with vivid passing images that give the movie it's unusual tone which provides a bizarre pulse throughout. In addition to the excellent directing is some great acting. Kevin Spacey and John Cusack are perfectly cast for their roles as are many of the supporting performers. The movie is worth watching for their performances alone.MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL is not a film that everyone will enjoy watching. It's kind of a quirky picture that makes people think. If you want a lot of action or even suspense, this probably isn't a movie you will want to watch. On the other hand, it you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary that might cause you to think, this garden might be a good place to start.",4,"Strange Story, Great Acting.",1092096000,"08 10, 2004",2004,1979,"['watched', 'MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'GARDEN', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'EVIL', 'first', 'time', 'five', 'years', 'ago', 'time', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'movie', 'one', 'was', 'also', 'fascinating', 'captured', 'imagination', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'based', 're-watched', 'movie', 'again', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'impressions', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'much', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'best', 'characters', 'book', 'were', 'compressed', 'totally', 'deleted', 'other', 'felt', 'movie', 'stayed', 'close', 'spirit', 'book.MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'GARDEN', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'EVIL', 'famous', 'murder', 'trial', 'took', 'place', 'Savannah', 'Georgia', 'movie', 'murder', 'trial', 'really', ""n't"", 'about', 'murder', 'Instead', 'trial', 'backdrop', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'really', 'movie', 'also', 'community', 'people', 'living', 'together', 'city', 'more', 'family', 'rather', 'socialized', 'living', 'environment.MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'GARDEN', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'EVIL', 'was', 'directed', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'directed', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'ballyhooed', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'movie', 'filled', 'vivid', 'passing', 'images', 'give', 'movie', 'unusual', 'tone', 'bizarre', 'pulse', 'addition', 'excellent', 'directing', 'great', 'acting', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'John', 'Cusack', 'are', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'roles', 'are', 'many', 'supporting', 'performers', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'performances', 'alone.MIDNIGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'GARDEN', 'OF', 'GOOD', 'AND', 'EVIL', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'kind', 'quirky', 'picture', 'people', 'think', 'want', 'lot', 'action', 'even', 'suspense', 'probably', ""n't"", 'movie', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'other', 'hand', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'ordinary', 'might', 'cause', 'think', 'garden', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start']",N/A

There's an old lady dressed like a homeless person who communes with the dead in strange ways and she laughs a lot for no flippin' reason.  She confused me a little.  Midnight is a little big of a murder mystery/ghost story.  Kevin Spacey plays Jim Williams, Savannah's newest rich person who gives enviable Christmas parties - the kind that everyone dies for an invitation to.  John Cusak plays John Kelso, a free lance writer who's sent by Town and Country to write a story on such party.  That's where the fun begins - the party.  That's all I want to say about the storyline as to not give anything away.I enjoyed Midnight as I would a late night scary (kinda) movie - fluff but not much substance or rather not much from my viewpoint.  It seems to me though that it would've been neat to set the story in New Orleans rather than Savannah - it's perceived to have more 'voodoo' in New Orleans as opposed to the other story.I am totally clueless - I didn't realize Midnight was based on a true crime and that there were four trials on the murder of Billy (can't remember his last name).  And that since it is based on a true crime, it's entirely wrong for a film to be based on any other city than Savannah.I hope you enjoy Midnight but not expect it to be this great and wonderful movie - Kevin Spacey does a fine job as Williams & Cusak is good too although it seems he's playing a character close to his own personality.",4,Strange movie,1402704000,"06 14, 2014",2014,1480,"['ca', ""n't"", 'rather', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'movie', 'old', 'lady', 'dressed', 'homeless', 'person', 'who', 'dead', 'strange', 'ways', 'lot', 'flippin', 'reason', 'confused', 'little', 'Midnight', 'little', 'big', 'murder', 'mystery/ghost', 'story', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Jim', 'Williams', 'Savannah', 'newest', 'rich', 'person', 'who', 'enviable', 'Christmas', 'parties', 'kind', 'everyone', 'invitation', 'John', 'Cusak', 'John', 'Kelso', 'free', 'lance', 'writer', 'who', 'sent', 'Town', 'Country', 'write', 'story', 'such', 'party', 'where', 'fun', 'party', 'want', 'say', 'storyline', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'away.I', 'enjoyed', 'Midnight', 'would', 'late', 'night', 'scary', 'kinda', 'movie', 'fluff', 'not', 'much', 'substance', 'rather', 'not', 'much', 'viewpoint', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'neat', 'set', 'story', 'New', 'Orleans', 'rather', 'Savannah', 'perceived', 'have', 'more', ""'voodoo"", 'New', 'Orleans', 'opposed', 'other', 'story.I', 'am', 'totally', 'clueless', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Midnight', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'were', 'four', 'trials', 'murder', 'Billy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'last', 'name', 'based', 'true', 'crime', 'entirely', 'wrong', 'film', 'be', 'based', 'other', 'city', 'Savannah.I', 'hope', 'enjoy', 'Midnight', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'great', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fine', 'job', 'Williams', 'Cusak', 'good', 'too', 'playing', 'character', 'close', 'own', 'personality']",N/A

Attorney Jack Thompson calmly tells him that the man is carrying out a testamentary bequest of a dog owner, even after the dog has long ago reached its resting place as well.  Kevin Spacey as a self-made antiques millionaire is Mr. Super Cool.  He informs Spacey that he had seen a previous article by him and is responsible for him getting the assignment.  Cusack quickly learns that to ""survive the final cut"" for a Spacey party in his historic Mercer House mansion (the family of songwriter Johnny Mercer) is a genuine local honor.After leaving the party and going to bed Cusack is awakened by the sound of police sirens.  He is calmly told that Spacey has shot a man, after which Cusack is asked, ""Care for a canape?""Cusack learns a great deal about Spacey after he is taken into custody and put on trial for the murder of the man who was his lover, local hot bisexual sex item and drug user Jude Law.  Britisher Law puts on a convincing Southern accent, as does Australian Jack Thompson, who plays Spacey's colorful defense attorney. Thompson astonishes Cusack by announcing he is going away during the weekend preceding the start of the trial.  When he asks why, Thompson replies calmly, ""The home football opener, the University of Georgia against Alabama.  I'll be back.""The interesting mix of local characters never falters.

I did allow this film to take me all the way south, because after seeing it, I had to go see the scenery, culture, the Bird Girl, and the Doll(Lady Chablis). Unfortunately, the Doll was out of town when I went to the now famous Club One.The movie is based on a book written by John Berent which was based on a true story, so it was wise that Eastwood had cast The Doll to play herself, because no real actor or actress or even other Black drag queens could become The Doll. She's glamourous, sassy, fearless, dramatic, full of wit and uncompromising! There was plenty of chemistry between John Cusack(the writer) and her.Kevin Spacey was very meticulous and convincing as a closeted gay man with much power and wealth and a thing for the not yet famous Jude Law(a rebellious boytoy again since Wilde), who was impressive with a southern accent. Spacey killed him, because he was sleeping around and doing drugs. He confessed in court that he did it in self-defense.John Cusack arrived from out of town to investigate the story for a magazine, and the first person he connected with was The Lady Chablis also listed in the phone book as F. for Frank, and he didn't know that she was a pre-op transsexual. It was funny when The Doll got into Cusack's car after she visited the clinic, she said,"" Ooh, I think the shots are kicking in!"" And Cusack had no idea what the bleep she was on. She dazzles and fascinates him with her story and her flirtatious moves.Cusack meets a ""witch""(Irma Hall) who had psychic power and told him about good and evil behind the murder case, and that the dead boytoy will make Spacey pay for his death, even if he was to be released for not guilty....This was a great murder mystery, and I really enjoyed watching The Doll dancing with John Cusack and the courtroom scene as well. Too bad she didn't even get a best supporting actor or actress nomination.

I have not read the book yet, but  I have seen A&amp;E special about the story before I watched the this feature film.  I  enjoyed this film more than the documentary itself.  So many powerful  little things are shown in this film, that no documentary can ever show. It  is amazing how, on one hand, the story behind the film is all true, and, on  the other hand, it is so surreal!  This film makes you think about  boundaries between the two: are they really there? or are they created only  by our imagination?  Anyway, this film is a pure delight: it is vivid,  witty, glamorous, dark, mysterious, and somewhat sad, all at once. I think  Kevin Spacey got the character to the smallest detail. Jude Law, even  though having only two lines and about three shots in the film, is  absolutely marvelous, too.  And the cross-dresser/perfomer/, Lady  Shablis(?), playing himself, is simply the best part of the film. I mean,  the way he/she figures into the plot is just amazing. Overall, very-well  done film.
