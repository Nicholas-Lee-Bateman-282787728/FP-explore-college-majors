1346787,AZEBQGWRW9GHC,B003IN7YOG,Delta,"[1, 1]","It was Marigold that sent me on my Bollywood quest. Although a American/Hindi hybrid - the acting of Salman Khan caught my eye ! And so began my epic journey to find/buy//or see everything that he has made. After watching him in Dabangg, Wanted, and Ek Tha Tiger. Veer was no disappointment either.  The elements of this fantastic actor is evident in every movie - Veer is no less.  What I love about Bollywood is they serve to entertain with acting, scenery, costumes, and most importantly music. This historical/period piece has it all. The action scenes were sometimes over the top...but that's what makes the movie good !  I loved the opulence and the tribal costumes.  It really didn't matter if they were totally on point historically - they worked. History is filled with deception - Veer does not suffer and Salman Khan plays it like a man in love ! I watched this movie without subtitles yet I was able to follow and grab the essence of every scene.  I didn't have to wonder when Veer's mother took off two gold bangles and gave them to him the intent - it was clear as a bell.  No words needed.  So I write this review based on the emotion and visual treatment of the movie.  You don't know what you are missing...give it a try then, see the others you won't be disappointed.",5,Pure Enjoyment !,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",2012,1285,"['was', 'Marigold', 'sent', 'Bollywood', 'quest', 'American/Hindi', 'hybrid', 'acting', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'caught', 'eye', 'so', 'began', 'epic', 'journey', 'find/buy//or', 'see', 'everything', 'made', 'watching', 'Dabangg', 'Wanted', 'Ek', 'Tha', 'Tiger', 'Veer', 'was', 'disappointment', 'either', 'elements', 'fantastic', 'actor', 'evident', 'movie', 'Veer', 'less', 'What', 'love', 'Bollywood', 'serve', 'entertain', 'acting', 'scenery', 'costumes', 'most', 'importantly', 'music', 'historical/period', 'piece', 'action', 'scenes', 'were', 'sometimes', 'top', 'what', 'movie', 'good', 'loved', 'opulence', 'tribal', 'costumes', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'were', 'totally', 'point', 'historically', 'worked', 'History', 'filled', 'deception', 'Veer', 'not', 'suffer', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'man', 'love', 'watched', 'movie', 'subtitles', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'follow', 'grab', 'essence', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'wonder', 'when', 'Veer', 'mother', 'took', 'off', 'two', 'gold', 'bangles', 'gave', 'intent', 'was', 'clear', 'bell', 'words', 'needed', 'So', 'write', 'review', 'based', 'emotion', 'visual', 'treatment', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'give', 'try', 'then', 'see', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",N/A
1346788,A1KIQ4P4ZW3ALF,B003IN7YOG,G. Teslovich,"[0, 0]",(1.) Cheaply produced movie with single prop of animated plastic dead horse and other cost savers.(2.) Way over the top acting that had no sense of realism.(3.) Disjointed editing and storyline that lacked believability and mostly historic accuracy. Reminded me of the '70s cowboys and indians movies where the indians were always 100% evil bad and the whites 100% angelic good. Except in reverse for this movie. You would think that hindsight and education would teach us about how complex life can be and issues are not so stereotypic black and white.(4.) The English school with visiting colonial subjects was just laughably prejudicial with some basis in fact. America did a similar thing with periods of romanticism in preserving Native culture alternating with periods of intervening educational opportunity with Native Americans attending schools outside Native culture that then resulted in the loss of some Native culture. This complexity is worthy of 100s of texts with analysis as to why; to what end; benefits/costs - not some quicky movie.,1,Cheap,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,1052,"['1', 'Cheaply', 'produced', 'movie', 'single', 'prop', 'animated', 'plastic', 'dead', 'horse', 'other', 'cost', 'savers.', '2', 'Way', 'top', 'acting', 'had', 'sense', 'realism.', '3', 'Disjointed', 'editing', 'storyline', 'lacked', 'believability', 'mostly', 'historic', 'accuracy', 'Reminded', ""'70s"", 'cowboys', 'movies', 'where', 'indians', 'were', 'always', '100', '%', 'evil', 'bad', 'whites', '100', '%', 'angelic', 'good', 'reverse', 'movie', 'would', 'think', 'hindsight', 'education', 'would', 'teach', 'how', 'complex', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'issues', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'stereotypic', 'black', 'white.', '4', 'English', 'school', 'visiting', 'colonial', 'subjects', 'was', 'just', 'laughably', 'prejudicial', 'basis', 'fact', 'America', 'did', 'similar', 'thing', 'periods', 'romanticism', 'preserving', 'Native', 'culture', 'alternating', 'periods', 'intervening', 'educational', 'opportunity', 'Native', 'Americans', 'attending', 'schools', 'outside', 'Native', 'culture', 'then', 'resulted', 'loss', 'Native', 'culture', 'complexity', 'worthy', '100s', 'texts', 'analysis', 'why', 'what', 'end', 'benefits/costs', 'not', 'quicky', 'movie']",N/A
1346789,AE3D2GUK0SKX3,B003IN7YOG,Larry,"[6, 6]","After ""Wanted"", Salman is hot as ever.  Eros, the DVD distributor,  bankrolled this mega budget period action movie.  This is Salman's dream project for 20 years.  And he wrote it himself.  The story is inspired by an old Russian novel.Imagine ""300"" meet ""Troy"" meet ""Gladiator"" meet ""Howard's End"" meet Bollywood musical.It's all here.  The action is sometime bloody violent, sometimes over the top, sometimes unintentionally funny - I mean Salman can ALMOST FLY!!!  like Hrithik in Krrish or Dhoom2.  They have these big budget action scene with hundreds of actors and horses and train and Salman flying on wires!! doing somersauts (like the opening Scene in Dhoom2).  While it was cool with Hrithik, here with Salman it is just funny!Don't get me wrong, I gave ""Wanted"" 5 stars on Amazon and Salman was GREAT in that movie.  Here, he seems to be the big super duper star on this movie.  Director Anil Sharma has not had a hit in many many years and probably no A-list Bollywood director or A-list actress wanted to tackle this superstar ego project.The movie is not all bad.  It is Lavishly produced.  Die hard Salman fans will like it no matter what.But sometimes the movie is illy.  In the movie Salman is a super killer, great horseman, barbaric tribesman,  then he wears a Tuxedo!! and sings and dance and I think plays the piano too!He goes to England and says oh England is no good blah blah,  India has Taj Mahal etc.  The blood on his arm in the movie and also on the DVD box looks so fake.The lead actress looks like she's Katrina Kaif's less pretty sister.  This movie is interesting as Camp.  Too bad they spent a lot of money on this one.  Worth a rental or if you're a die hard Salman fan, maybe a purchase.",3,Big Budget action romance Bollywood musical .,1278720000,"07 10, 2010",2010,1723,"['Wanted', 'Salman', 'hot', 'ever', 'Eros', 'DVD', 'distributor', 'bankrolled', 'mega', 'budget', 'period', 'action', 'movie', 'Salman', 'dream', 'project', '20', 'years', 'wrote', 'story', 'inspired', 'old', 'Russian', 'novel.Imagine', '300', 'meet', 'Troy', 'meet', 'Gladiator', 'meet', 'Howard', 'End', 'meet', 'Bollywood', 'musical.It', 'here', 'action', 'sometime', 'bloody', 'violent', 'sometimes', 'top', 'sometimes', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'mean', 'Salman', 'can', 'ALMOST', 'FLY', 'Hrithik', 'Krrish', 'Dhoom2', 'have', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'scene', 'hundreds', 'actors', 'horses', 'train', 'Salman', 'flying', 'wires', 'doing', 'somersauts', 'opening', 'Scene', 'Dhoom2', 'was', 'cool', 'Hrithik', 'here', 'Salman', 'just', 'funny', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'gave', 'Wanted', '5', 'stars', 'Amazon', 'Salman', 'was', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'Here', 'be', 'big', 'super', 'duper', 'star', 'movie', 'Director', 'Anil', 'Sharma', 'not', 'had', 'hit', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'probably', 'A-list', 'Bollywood', 'director', 'A-list', 'actress', 'wanted', 'tackle', 'superstar', 'project.The', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'Lavishly', 'produced', 'Die', 'hard', 'Salman', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'matter', 'what.But', 'movie', 'illy', 'movie', 'Salman', 'super', 'killer', 'great', 'horseman', 'barbaric', 'tribesman', 'then', 'Tuxedo', 'sings', 'dance', 'think', 'piano', 'too', 'England', 'oh', 'England', 'good', 'blah', 'blah', 'India', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'etc', 'blood', 'arm', 'movie', 'also', 'DVD', 'box', 'so', 'fake.The', 'lead', 'actress', 'Katrina', 'Kaif', 'less', 'pretty', 'sister', 'movie', 'interesting', 'Camp', 'Too', 'bad', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'one', 'rental', ""'re"", 'die', 'hard', 'Salman', 'fan', 'maybe', 'purchase']",N/A

The sets are beyond GORGEOUS in this movie. Character development is great here and  Salman Khan is at his usual best in a role that suits him perfectly.It's a nice piece of eye candy to add to your collection, not to mention the songs are lovely throughout. One of my favs for the overall effect of the movie and plot as a whole. Perhaps not as touching as some other films he's been in, but it's one of the most enjoyable to watch.",5,"Beautiful, action-packed romance",1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,560,"['little', 'campy', 'little', 'funny', 'little', 'violent', 'lot', 'heart', 'Romance', 'where', 'action', 'where', 'needed', 'sets', 'are', 'GORGEOUS', 'movie', 'Character', 'development', 'great', 'here', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'usual', 'best', 'role', 'suits', 'perfectly.It', 'nice', 'piece', 'eye', 'candy', 'add', 'collection', 'not', 'mention', 'songs', 'are', 'lovely', 'One', 'favs', 'overall', 'effect', 'movie', 'plot', 'whole', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'as', 'touching', 'other', 'films', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'watch']",N/A
1346791,A14H191AH66PPK,B003IN7YOG,Traddles,"[3, 3]","""Veer"" is a sprawling, action epic starring Hindi cinema's favorite action hero, Salman Khan. The violence and gore is reminiscent of ""Gladiator"", and the elaborate fight sequences centering on the hero-who-can-do-anything will remind you of Brad Pitt in ""Troy"".  Of course, Salman can do something that neither Russell Crowe nor Brad Pitt can do - dance! But more on that later.""Veer"" opens in 1870s colonial India: various tribes and chiefdoms vie for power by collaborating with the occupying British.  One of these tribes, the Pindari, are a rough bunch who live by a strict code of honor - a code that is often maintained through duels within the tribe itself.  One thing the Pindari refuse to do, however, is collaborate with the British.  When they are betrayed by a more sophisticated Indian chiefdom, they become even more entrenched in their hatred for the British and their Indian puppet-kings.Our hero, Veer, is born to the Pindari tribe after this great betrayal, and he is raised to be fiercely anti-British and physically aggressive. However, unlike his father, he is also raised to be educated so that he might one day match the cunning of the British. Veer is sent to England, ostensibly to join one of the schools meant to educate the ""natives"", but really to learn the ways of the evil occupiers.As one reviewer noted, it is true that this film portrays sections of society in rather black-and-white terms: the British are always evil; the Pindari are always fighting for what is right; and other Indians who collaborate are good at heart but unfortunately stuck with corrupt rulers who follow the British.  This film suffers from what almost every other Hindi film suffers from: mediocre actors in the ""white"" roles.  I've always been puzzled as to why this is the case, or where Indian studios find their white actors, but they never quite live up to their Indian counterparts in the acting department. So, be prepared for some stiff acting from the British actors.On the Indian side, however, the casting is superb. Mithun Chakraborty looks fantastic and entirely believable as the chief of the Pindaris; Jackie Shroff is also great as the corrupt ruler of the kingdom of Madhavgarh. Zarine Khan is beautiful and fits the role of a crown princess who is also being educated abroad.  Her character is a bit more passive than I would have liked, but to be honest, this film is really not about the women.  Salman Khan is, of course, perfect for the role (since he wrote it himself).The locations are stunning, particularly the shots of Rajasthan. It's the costume design that is strangely divided: the Indian costumes are magnificent, the British ones less so.  The time period should be turn of the century, but the Western costumes seem to run the gamut from late 19th century to 1920s in style.  It feels as though the costume designers weren't too sure about the Western outfits, particularly for women, and they're not as high quality as the Indian costumes.The music is pretty good - the opening song, ""Taali"", is a rousing number that features Mithun, Salman, and Sohail Khan with some good choreography. ""Meherbaniyan"" is a catchy song with some bagpipe-sounding elements. I particularly like the choreography for this one, because it's creatively structured around the fact that Veer is supposed to have an injured leg at this point in the story, so the steps are meant to highlight that Veer's dancing mostly on one leg.  Very fun, and Salman's a great dancer.  ""Surili Akhiyon Wale"" is the main love theme and it's very nice - especially with the fantastic Rahat Fateh Ali Khan on lead vocals - but it would have been better without the female English part.Overall, the story is a bit lacking in nuance, but if you're a fan of big historical epics, then it's worth watching.  I was particularly struck by the amount of violence and blood, which I haven't seen very frequently in Hindi movies.  Veer is a vicious, tribal character who also adheres strictly to his code of honor.  His character is perhaps the most nuanced, as he wrestles with very violent rage alongside a desire to be humane.",3,Lavish production with some shortfalls,1304467200,"05 4, 2011",2011,4123,"['Veer', 'sprawling', 'action', 'epic', 'starring', 'Hindi', 'cinema', 'favorite', 'action', 'hero', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'violence', 'gore', 'reminiscent', 'Gladiator', 'elaborate', 'fight', 'sequences', 'centering', 'hero-who-can-do-anything', 'will', 'remind', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Troy', 'course', 'Salman', 'can', 'do', 'something', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'can', 'do', 'dance', 'more', 'later', 'Veer', '1870s', 'colonial', 'India', 'various', 'tribes', 'chiefdoms', 'vie', 'power', 'collaborating', 'occupying', 'British', 'One', 'tribes', 'Pindari', 'are', 'rough', 'bunch', 'who', 'live', 'strict', 'code', 'honor', 'code', 'often', 'maintained', 'duels', 'tribe', 'One', 'thing', 'Pindari', 'refuse', 'do', 'however', 'collaborate', 'British', 'When', 'are', 'betrayed', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'Indian', 'chiefdom', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'entrenched', 'hatred', 'British', 'Indian', 'puppet-kings.Our', 'hero', 'Veer', 'born', 'Pindari', 'tribe', 'great', 'betrayal', 'raised', 'be', 'fiercely', 'anti-British', 'physically', 'aggressive', 'However', 'father', 'also', 'raised', 'be', 'educated', 'so', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'match', 'cunning', 'British', 'Veer', 'sent', 'England', 'ostensibly', 'join', 'one', 'schools', 'meant', 'educate', 'natives', 'really', 'learn', 'ways', 'evil', 'occupiers.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'true', 'film', 'sections', 'society', 'rather', 'black-and-white', 'terms', 'British', 'are', 'always', 'evil', 'Pindari', 'are', 'always', 'fighting', 'what', 'right', 'other', 'Indians', 'who', 'collaborate', 'are', 'good', 'heart', 'unfortunately', 'stuck', 'corrupt', 'rulers', 'who', 'follow', 'British', 'film', 'suffers', 'what', 'almost', 'other', 'Hindi', 'film', 'suffers', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'white', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'puzzled', 'why', 'case', 'where', 'Indian', 'studios', 'find', 'white', 'actors', 'never', 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'Indian', 'counterparts', 'acting', 'department', 'So', 'be', 'prepared', 'stiff', 'acting', 'British', 'actors.On', 'Indian', 'side', 'however', 'casting', 'superb', 'Mithun', 'Chakraborty', 'fantastic', 'entirely', 'believable', 'chief', 'Pindaris', 'Jackie', 'Shroff', 'also', 'great', 'corrupt', 'ruler', 'kingdom', 'Madhavgarh', 'Zarine', 'Khan', 'beautiful', 'role', 'crown', 'princess', 'who', 'also', 'being', 'educated', 'abroad', 'character', 'bit', 'more', 'passive', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'honest', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'women', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'course', 'perfect', 'role', 'wrote', '.The', 'locations', 'are', 'stunning', 'particularly', 'shots', 'Rajasthan', 'costume', 'design', 'strangely', 'divided', 'Indian', 'costumes', 'are', 'magnificent', 'British', 'ones', 'less', 'so', 'time', 'period', 'should', 'be', 'turn', 'century', 'Western', 'costumes', 'seem', 'run', 'gamut', 'late', '19th', 'century', '1920s', 'style', 'costume', 'designers', 'were', ""n't"", 'too', 'sure', 'Western', 'outfits', 'particularly', 'women', ""'re"", 'not', 'as', 'high', 'quality', 'Indian', 'costumes.The', 'music', 'pretty', 'good', 'opening', 'song', 'Taali', 'rousing', 'number', 'Mithun', 'Salman', 'Sohail', 'Khan', 'good', 'choreography', 'Meherbaniyan', 'catchy', 'song', 'bagpipe-sounding', 'elements', 'particularly', 'choreography', 'one', 'creatively', 'structured', 'fact', 'Veer', 'supposed', 'have', 'injured', 'leg', 'point', 'story', 'steps', 'are', 'meant', 'highlight', 'Veer', 'dancing', 'mostly', 'one', 'leg', 'Very', 'fun', 'Salman', 'great', 'dancer', 'Surili', 'Akhiyon', 'Wale', 'main', 'love', 'theme', 'very', 'nice', 'especially', 'fantastic', 'Rahat', 'Fateh', 'Ali', 'Khan', 'lead', 'vocals', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'female', 'English', 'part.Overall', 'story', 'bit', 'lacking', 'nuance', ""'re"", 'fan', 'big', 'historical', 'epics', 'then', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'particularly', 'struck', 'amount', 'violence', 'blood', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'very', 'frequently', 'Hindi', 'movies', 'Veer', 'vicious', 'tribal', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'strictly', 'code', 'honor', 'character', 'perhaps', 'most', 'nuanced', 'very', 'violent', 'rage', 'desire', 'be', 'humane']",N/A
