783159,A27ZLV4D9EE0V4,B0000TGABO,Baby Doll,"[0, 0]",It pains me to have to give a Pooh movie 1 star but I did not like this one at all. First off its more abOut Rabbit than Roo. Secondly and mostly Rabbit is mean and nasty in this movie. Instead of being his normal cranky self he's down right hateful. I love Winnie the Pooh and how my 3 year old boys love and know all the characters but Rabbit's character not only makes you dislike him but fear him. I do wish the real reason had been included. I'm not big on movies that omit the true reason behind Christmas or  Easter but unfortunately I've come to expect that. I just wish they hadn't made Rabbit so nasty. I don't plan on letting my boys watch this one again. I don't want them to dislike Rabbit's character or think that's how one behaves when upset. I thought about buying this one but decided to rent it instead. Glad I didn't buy it.,1,More Rabbit than Roo and a Mean Rabbit at That,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,844,"['have', 'give', 'Pooh', 'movie', '1', 'star', 'did', 'not', 'one', 'First', 'more', 'Rabbit', 'Roo', 'Secondly', 'mostly', 'Rabbit', 'mean', 'nasty', 'movie', 'Instead', 'being', 'normal', 'cranky', 'self', 'down', 'right', 'hateful', 'love', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'how', '3', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'love', 'know', 'characters', 'Rabbit', 'character', 'not', 'only', 'dislike', 'fear', 'do', 'wish', 'real', 'reason', 'had', 'been', 'included', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'movies', 'omit', 'true', 'reason', 'Christmas', 'Easter', 'unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'just', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'made', 'Rabbit', 'so', 'nasty', 'do', ""n't"", 'plan', 'letting', 'boys', 'watch', 'one', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'dislike', 'Rabbit', 'character', 'think', 'how', 'one', 'when', 'upset', 'thought', 'about', 'buying', 'one', 'decided', 'rent', 'instead', 'Glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy']",N/A
783160,A2HLZFV0UUT9IQ,B0000TGABO,Family Movie Critic,"[7, 9]","""Springtime With Roo"" would be better titled ""An Easter Carol,"" seeing as the story is a rip off of the classic Dicken's tale. The storyline is that Roo is very excited for his second Easter egg hunt, but Rabbit decides not to do Easter this year. Instead, he wants to have spring cleaning day. So the narrator takes rabbit(Scrooge) back in time to see the way Easter was last year. Then the narrator shows Rabbit the future and what will happen if he dosen't have Easter.Disney usually has an entertaining story that everyone can get interested in, but they failed to do that with this Pooh film. There also aren't any jokes to laugh at. Only small children will have a good time with this film. The two Easter themed episodes from the popular series ""The Wonderful World of Winnie The Pooh"" which are extras on the DVD are better than the movie itself.

In homage to Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol, the narrator shows Rabbit what the future will be like for him if he continues to deny little Roo and the other critters of the Hundred Acre Wood their Easter fun.On Roo's second Easter, the whole gang is expecting an enjoyable, egg-hunting bash like they had last year, with Rabbit serving as their Easter Bunny host. What they don't remember from last year is how disappointed and frazzled Old Long Ears got when the gang wouldn't follow his Easter instructions with precision. The gang ended up having a grand time, but Rabbit secretly swore that he'd never play Easter Bunny again. And he meant it-until he ruins this year's Easter celebration AND the narrator convinces him that his friends will become so distraught over his denial of Easter that they all move away, leaving Rabbit bereft, draped in cobwebs and alone in the Hundred Acre Wood.Sinister narrators aside, it's a wonderful lesson for children on how friendship has to be a two-way street, and how laughter can trump tidiness on any given day, especially holidays!For those of you parents who have been swindled by Pooh movies in the past, rest assured, this one is actually a new feature, not a clumsy cut-and-paste job of old television cartoons.
