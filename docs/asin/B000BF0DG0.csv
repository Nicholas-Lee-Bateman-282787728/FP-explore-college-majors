941540,A20FK68BUB1IVA,B000BF0DG0,Happy Reader,"[1, 1]","This is Set Five out of six total Collection Sets. Set Five has six ""Inspector Morse"" episodes. The first two were the ending episodes in the original BBC Series 6. (BBC uses ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) The next three make up the BBC Series 7 in its entirety. The last episode in this set is the first of the ""Inspector Morse Specials"", that ran one to a year.[Note: You don't want to confuse the six ""Collection Sets"" with a newer run of ""Inspector Morse"" DVD's, called simply ""Sets"". There are eleven ""Sets"", called ""Inspector Morse Set One"", and so on. Each ""Set"" has only three episodes on three discs.]Episodes:Absolute Conviction - first aired April 1992Cherubim & Seraphim - aired April 1992Deadly Slumber - January 1993The Day of the Devil - aired January 1993Twilight of the Gods - aired January 1993The Way Through the Woods - aired November 1995ABSOLUTE CONVICTION:We're in the minimum security HMP Farnleigh (Her Majesty's Prison), when Alex Bailey (played by a young lean Sean Bean) finds himself locked in his room. Someone has it in for Bailey, but he remains cocky. Bailey, Lawrence Cryer and Brian Thornton each got only 2 years in this ""country club"" prison for defrauding investors in the now-defunct Cryer Investments. No reparations were made, so Morse suspects that there's a lot of money tucked away somewhere, waiting for them when they get out of prison.Then Lawrence Cryer is killed in Bailey's cell, an induced massive heart attack. Morse and Lewis have to work with the Governor (= Warden) to discover, not only who killed Cryer, but how. There are lots of suspects to investigate. The other partners, not wanting to share the missing loot. The young wife, getting it on with Thornton's son. And Cryer is only the first death.Trivia: This episode was written by John Brown, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter.CHERUBIM & SERAPHIM:It's dawn, and teenagers pour out of a cavernous industrial building, leaving what we might call a rave. Marilyn, a good looking blonde, is peaceful but pensive. She turns to her friend, Vicky, and says, ""That was the most wonderful... [The next] can't be as good as tonight. It can never be as good as tonight... Tonight was it for me.""Terribly, we see just what she means, when she commits suicide. Morse takes leave from work when he finds out, because Marilyn was the beloved daughter of his step-sister.Then two more teens, intelligent, lots-to-look-forward-to teens, commit suicide, and Morse is on the case. Something, he's sure, is connecting the deaths. They get a break. The third suicide has a partially digested pill in his stomach, and it's some kind of mood enhancer they haven't seen before.We get more insights into Morse when, tired and shattered, he tells Lewis about his childhood, and why he considered suicide at one point. Morse is so uncharacteristically open that he even calls Lewis ""Robby"".Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. In ""The Story of Morse"", a 50 minute documentary special, John Thaw says this about his character: ""I keep using the word 'sad' in relation to him, and that's the way I feel about it. That's the way I played him right through.""DEADLY SLUMBER:Dr. Matthew Brewster leaves the Brewster Clinic and heads home for the night. His wife, Claire, who worked with him creating the groundbreaking clinic, is waiting for him at home, and frets when he doesn't show up. We see why. He's in the detached garage, door closed, motor running, dead.The pathologist says it's murder, and Morse and Lewis start by interviewing the family. John Brewster, son, shows Morse threatening letters his father had received. This leads Morse to Michael Steppings, who's filed a lawsuit against the clinic on behalf of his daughter, invalided during surgery at the Brewster Clinic. Steppings is such a straight-forward man, clear, open, unwavering in his love for his daughter, that when some evidence points towards him, Morse is reluctant to believe it.Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. I usually don't notice bloopers, but even I saw this one. Matthew Brewster's body lies on the pathologist's table with nothing on but a towel draped over his hips. As the pathologist talks to Morse and Lewis, the body on the table takes a deep breath!THE DAY OF THE DEVIL:In a prison hospital, a guard lays draped across his desk, drugged, as his shirt, wallet and keys are taken off him. We see the escaping prisoner sneak around to the outside of the building, where he gets a spectacular break. Dr. Martin, psychologist, is just leaving from the night shift. She is taking a lot of files home, and leaves the keys in her car door as she goes inside to get the 2nd batch.Thames Valley CID goes on red alert. The escapee is John Peter Barry AKA The Devil's Disciple. Barry stays one step ahead of them by changing his disguise more than once. Morse visits Barry's room at the hospital and is horrified that they allowed him to paint occult signs on his wall, and encouraged him in writing a book, a ""Black Bible"". ""Weren't you meant to be curing him of this?"", and angry Morse asks the hospital General Manager.He replies, ""By indulging him, he opened up to one of our psychiatrists, Esther Martin. In order to engage Barry, Martin read up on the occult. He came to see her as a fellow believer, and more, as an earthly medium for some demoness, Astrath.""""And you bought this?"" Morse in his best not-suffer-fools-gladly voice. Alarms certainly went off in my head!Trivia: This episode was written by Daniel Boyle, based on characters created by Colin Dexter.TWILIGHT OF THE GODS:Andrew Baydon, successful entrepreneur, wants to donate a huge new building to the college. He's receiving an honorary degree, but he's not in a good mood. He's furious over uncomplimentary newspaper stories and he expects someone at the end of a phone call to do something about it.The second story thread starts with Morse attending a special class at the Sheldonian Theatre, given by Gwladys Probert, the Welsh Canary. He is enthralled by her demonstrations of opera singing and expression. He looks forward even more to her concert that night. In the meanwhile, a dogwalker finds a young Neville Grimshaw with a bullet hole through his forehead. Lewis is taking notes at the scene, but Morse hasn't arrived yet.That's because he's at the florist, ordering two dozen long stemmed roses to be sent to the diva before her concert. The card with the flowers reads, ""To the greatest diva of her time, with grateful thanks from an admirer."" And ""diva"" is right. At the time, Gladys is in her dressing room screaming at her sister, Mari, who is supposed to be grateful to her, but doesn't look it.Morse is shattered when Gwladys Probert is shot in a college square in a group of college dons and Andrew Baydon. ""Why her?"" Morse asks rhetorically. ""What harm does a beautiful voice to do anyone?""Trivia: This episode was written by Julian Mitchell, based on the characters created by Colin Dexter. Gwladys Probert is played by Sheila Gish. Her singing is dubbed by Susan McCulloch. Lord Hinksey, the politically incorrrect college Chancellor, is played with daffiness by Sir John Gielgud, 89 at the time.THE WAY THROUGH THE WOODS:Steven Parnell is cleaning the bathroom at his prison, when he's attacked by three other inmates. The guards and the chaplain rush to him, and he whispers something just before he dies.Morse and Chief Superintendent Strange are talking about Parnell. They got Parnell's confession to five killings, but Morse was never happy with that. Karen Anderson, the 5th victim, was different from the others, and they've never found her body. Plus, Parnell confessed after a grueling interview with DCI John Johnson. According to Morse, ""Given John's interview technique, I'm surprised he didn't confess to the A6, the Julia Wallace and the Whitechapel Murders.""Morse is on leave (supposedly). Lewis and the aforementioned DCI Johnson go to the prison and talk to the chaplain. He tells them about Parnell's final whisper, "" 'Not the girl... not the last.' Those were his words. I took from that that he'd meant four, he killed four, the two couples."" Don't you love it when Morse is right?Trivia: This special was written by Russell Lewis, based on the book of the same name by Colin Dexter. It was his 10th Inspector Morse novel, published in 1993.Morse mentions three famous murders. The Whitechapel Murders, of course, refer to Jack the Ripper. In 1931, William Wallace was convicted, later overturned, for murdering his wife Julia. It is still discussed today, the way in the U.S. we wonder whether Richard Kimble or the one-armed man killed Helen Kimble. The A6 Murders happened in 1962. James Hanratty was hanged for shooting and raping a couple on an A6 lay-by. This was controversial; Hanratty had no previous history of violence, and the court did not allow evidence of his prognosis of ""mental deficiency"". The did-he-or-didn't-he controversy lasted until 2000 (five years after this episode aired), when DNA analysis confirmed Hanratty's involvement.",5,"Episode Synopsis - Some Melodrama, but Still GREAT Inspector Morse!
