This is a excellent DVD of a Christmas story told by Chip Davis and Olivia Newton-John. It has music and ice skating to portray the story. My 5 year old grandson loves this so much that we had to buy a second DVD because he has warn the first one out. The story is an old tradition story with great effects and can be enjoyed by the whole family.,5,Mannheim Steamroller - The Christmas Angel: A Story on Ice,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,406,"['Mannheim', 'Steamroller', 'Christmas', 'Angel', 'Story', 'Ice', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'story', 'told', 'Chip', 'Davis', 'Olivia', 'Newton-John', 'music', 'ice', 'skating', 'portray', 'story', '5', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'buy', 'second', 'DVD', 'warn', 'first', 'one', 'out', 'story', 'old', 'tradition', 'story', 'great', 'effects', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'whole', 'family']",N/A

To my amazement, a slew of Christmas-themed costumed characters skated in random directions like roaches scattering after a light is flipped on.  Not only was I frozen in disbelief as this sad excuse for a Christmas special rolled on, but was actually unable to move to turn the channel.  Seeing the hypnotizing part that I did of this terrible production has remained a macabre plight burned into my brain.  Luckily, I was able to somehow move my hand to the control and eventually turn the channel after the shock and disbelief that something like this would be aired on television wore off.  If I could give this movie a negative star rating I would.  Not enjoying this production has nothing to do with the lack of Christmas spirit; the blazingly horrible choreography and random characters from all facets of Christmas rolled into one scene would be too much for anyone I know to stomach.  I definitely agree with Chef.  This is just one of those Christmas specials that networks use to take up air time so that they can go home and enjoy a real Christmas with their families, sans this bag of crap.",1,Unfortunate Experience,1259107200,"11 25, 2009",2009,1243,"['hold', 'place', 'unfortunate', 'viewer', 'who', 'stumbled', 'steaming', 'pile', 'crap', 'perusing', 'channels', 'Christmas', 'last', 'year', 'amazement', 'slew', 'Christmas-themed', 'costumed', 'characters', 'skated', 'random', 'directions', 'roaches', 'scattering', 'light', 'flipped', 'Not', 'only', 'was', 'frozen', 'disbelief', 'sad', 'excuse', 'Christmas', 'special', 'rolled', 'was', 'actually', 'unable', 'move', 'turn', 'channel', 'Seeing', 'hypnotizing', 'part', 'did', 'terrible', 'production', 'remained', 'macabre', 'plight', 'burned', 'brain', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'somehow', 'move', 'hand', 'control', 'eventually', 'turn', 'channel', 'shock', 'disbelief', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'aired', 'television', 'wore', 'off', 'could', 'give', 'movie', 'negative', 'star', 'rating', 'would', 'Not', 'enjoying', 'production', 'nothing', 'do', 'lack', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'blazingly', 'horrible', 'choreography', 'random', 'characters', 'facets', 'Christmas', 'rolled', 'one', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'anyone', 'know', 'stomach', 'definitely', 'agree', 'Chef', 'just', 'one', 'Christmas', 'specials', 'networks', 'use', 'take', 'up', 'air', 'time', 'can', 'go', 'home', 'enjoy', 'real', 'Christmas', 'families', 'sans', 'bag', 'crap']",N/A

There are 3 areas on this disc that break up so badly, as if there was a bad rainstorm while watching satellite TV, that we thought that the disc itself was flawed. We complained to Amazon and they kindly gave is a free return label and immediately sent us another new DVD. Well, the new DVD was identical in every flawed detail to the first one. The producers and marketers of this DVD have a lot to learn about quality control and customer satisfaction. I am following up this review with an attempt to contact the producers and get them to do the right thing but it will probably be a fruitless task.

The addition of Mannheim Steamroller music adds to its uniqueness. I bought a sample of this DVD last year and decided I must have the complete show. Well executed wih a cute story line.

Was not prepared for a highly professional staging of what could have been a boring storyline.Elvis Stojko, Dorothy Hamel and Rudy Galindo, as the leads, are well known for their excellent skating talents, but they showed great acting ability as well. the quality of the supporting cast was excellent. The costuming, sets and special effects were absolutely top-notch for its time, and better than some of the modern productions. I was very sorry I did not know about this when it came out originally, but the joy of sorting through Amazon is the jewels I find, and this is one.I didn't see the point of the introduction with Olivia Newton-John, unless it was to add unnecessary ""star-attraction."" It interfered with the continuity of the skating production.
