43830,A3DM6UGX44NJ9K,078311611X,"Daigo Parry ""Hodor""","[5, 8]","Nearly every comic book collector, old and new, flocked to their local stores to pick up Image Comics' launcher Spawn, by Todd MacFarlane, coming off a superb SpiderMan run; the overhyped (and badly done) movie also grabbed attention, but few fans got to see the animated series as it was played on HBO, a necessary compromise to allow all the nudity, violence and gore to get airtime.Just as a reminder for newbies, Spawn is really Al Simmons, once the government's deadliest secret forces soldier, betrayed and murdered; he makes a deal with the devil to be able to come back to see his wife one more time, and instead is endowed with supernatural powers, stripped of his memories, and thrown back to Earth as one of Hell's own elite force.Just as with every comic book to TV effort, the great details on paper don't translate as accurately onto film, (save for pure Japanese anime, which seems to have little or no problem doing this) something that is once again true with Spawn: The Animated Series. The animators do a decent job of getting the characters well within the ballpark of MacFarlane's vision: the bums' depressive, glazed faces, bad guy Wynn's evil glare and Twitch's I-Don't-Care face, complete with reflective glasses.But the art is still nowhere near the top anime products out there (this was a 1999 effort), and is closer to the animation in the X-Men series on Fox (not Evolution, the original). The lines are extremely thick, the proportions unmaintained, and the direction choppy. While award-winning series like Batman, and the subsequent Superman and Justice League efforts recruited Japanese animators, they sacrificed a tremendous amount of detail for crisper, more fluid action. Spawn cannot afford such a sacrifice; part of its appeal is the grimy, realistic tint that MacFarlane excelled in creating. At least knowing that MacFarlane approved of the series gives you some peace of mind, although he also approved of the live action movie.The voices are top notch. They are exactly how you would imagine them to be. Spawn/Simmons growls out in a grating baritone; Wynn projects an arrogant Jonathan Frakes' (of Star Trek The Next Generation's Will Riker fame) voice; and the Violator moves away from John Leguizamoville to the more taunting, feisty urbanite jeer that it should be.The series plays out much like the comic book, although it is often abbreviated, without losing too many important parts. The first disc of this collection covers Simmons' arrival on Earth as Spawn, and his ongoing struggle to regain his identity and purpose as he lives among humanity's rubble. Disc two moves backward and forward in time as Simmons begins to reclaim the whos, whats, whens, whens, wheres, whys and hows of his life; he rediscovers his best friend Terry Fitzgerald, now married to his wife Wanda and caring for his daughter Cyan. He flashes back to his old special forces days, his comrades of that time, one of whom killed him, and seeks him yet again. The third disc shows the world turning to chaos, just as Simmons is beginning to learn and manage his power; he now has to contend with Heaven's bounty hunters, who have been set out to destroy him--apparently, there have been many Spawns over the course of time, always in battle, not always victorious, against Heaven's own army.The series does lack closure; it ends with the feeling that a fourth season is on the way (which we all know isn't). For such a franchise loaded with beautifully grim landscapes and colorful characters with artistically brilliant power effects, not much seems to have been invested into getting the most out of the animation. If you can remember what the old X-Men series of the mid-1990s was like, then you can visualize the art of this series: very third-rate, when compared to what is available.Spawn front loads the discs with 32 chapters on the first disc; 19 on the second and 29 on the third. Be careful with the discs as they are double-sided (Side A, Side B) DVDs that need to be flipped over for the rest of the show.It's a must-buy for Spawn fans, since it gives us the chance to see the characters we're so used to seeing on paper finally move around; those unfamiliar with the series and looking for ""anime"" will be severely disappointed by the art, but not the storyline. Recommended for Spawn fans, but not for the casual viewer.",3,MacFarlane's Masterpiece Finally Makes It To DVD,1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,4359,"['Nearly', 'comic', 'book', 'collector', 'old', 'new', 'flocked', 'local', 'stores', 'pick', 'up', 'Image', 'Comics', 'launcher', 'Spawn', 'Todd', 'MacFarlane', 'coming', 'off', 'superb', 'SpiderMan', 'run', 'overhyped', 'badly', 'done', 'movie', 'also', 'grabbed', 'attention', 'few', 'fans', 'got', 'see', 'animated', 'series', 'was', 'played', 'HBO', 'necessary', 'compromise', 'allow', 'nudity', 'violence', 'gore', 'get', 'airtime.Just', 'reminder', 'newbies', 'Spawn', 'really', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'once', 'government', 'deadliest', 'secret', 'forces', 'soldier', 'betrayed', 'murdered', 'deal', 'devil', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'back', 'see', 'wife', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'instead', 'endowed', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'stripped', 'memories', 'thrown', 'back', 'Earth', 'one', 'Hell', 'own', 'elite', 'force.Just', 'comic', 'book', 'TV', 'effort', 'great', 'details', 'paper', 'do', ""n't"", 'translate', 'accurately', 'film', 'save', 'pure', 'Japanese', 'anime', 'have', 'little', 'problem', 'doing', 'something', 'once', 'again', 'true', 'Spawn', 'Animated', 'Series', 'animators', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'getting', 'characters', 'well', 'ballpark', 'MacFarlane', 'vision', 'bums', 'depressive', 'glazed', 'bad', 'guy', 'Wynn', 'evil', 'glare', 'Twitch', ""I-Don't-Care"", 'face', 'complete', 'reflective', 'glasses.But', 'art', 'still', 'nowhere', 'top', 'anime', 'products', 'there', 'was', '1999', 'effort', 'closer', 'animation', 'X-Men', 'series', 'Fox', 'not', 'Evolution', 'original', 'lines', 'are', 'extremely', 'thick', 'proportions', 'unmaintained', 'direction', 'choppy', 'award-winning', 'series', 'Batman', 'subsequent', 'Superman', 'Justice', 'League', 'efforts', 'recruited', 'Japanese', 'animators', 'sacrificed', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'detail', 'crisper', 'more', 'fluid', 'action', 'Spawn', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'such', 'sacrifice', 'part', 'appeal', 'grimy', 'realistic', 'tint', 'MacFarlane', 'excelled', 'creating', 'least', 'knowing', 'MacFarlane', 'approved', 'series', 'peace', 'mind', 'also', 'approved', 'live', 'action', 'movie.The', 'voices', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'are', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', 'imagine', 'be', 'Spawn/Simmons', 'out', 'grating', 'baritone', 'Wynn', 'projects', 'arrogant', 'Jonathan', 'Frakes', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Will', 'Riker', 'fame', 'voice', 'Violator', 'away', 'John', 'Leguizamoville', 'more', 'taunting', 'feisty', 'urbanite', 'jeer', 'should', 'be.The', 'series', 'out', 'much', 'comic', 'book', 'often', 'abbreviated', 'losing', 'too', 'many', 'important', 'parts', 'first', 'disc', 'collection', 'Simmons', 'arrival', 'Earth', 'Spawn', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'regain', 'identity', 'purpose', 'humanity', 'rubble', 'Disc', 'two', 'moves', 'backward', 'forward', 'time', 'Simmons', 'reclaim', 'whos', 'whats', 'whens', 'whens', 'wheres', 'whys', 'hows', 'life', 'best', 'friend', 'Terry', 'Fitzgerald', 'now', 'married', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'caring', 'daughter', 'Cyan', 'back', 'old', 'special', 'forces', 'days', 'comrades', 'time', 'one', 'whom', 'killed', 'yet', 'again', 'third', 'disc', 'world', 'turning', 'chaos', 'just', 'Simmons', 'beginning', 'learn', 'manage', 'power', 'now', 'contend', 'Heaven', 'bounty', 'hunters', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'apparently', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'Spawns', 'course', 'time', 'always', 'battle', 'not', 'always', 'victorious', 'Heaven', 'own', 'army.The', 'series', 'lack', 'closure', 'feeling', 'fourth', 'season', 'way', 'know', ""n't"", 'such', 'franchise', 'loaded', 'beautifully', 'grim', 'landscapes', 'colorful', 'characters', 'artistically', 'brilliant', 'power', 'effects', 'not', 'much', 'have', 'been', 'invested', 'getting', 'most', 'animation', 'can', 'remember', 'what', 'old', 'X-Men', 'series', 'mid-1990s', 'was', 'then', 'can', 'visualize', 'art', 'series', 'very', 'third-rate', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'available.Spawn', 'front', 'discs', '32', 'chapters', 'first', 'disc', '19', 'second', '29', 'third', 'Be', 'careful', 'discs', 'are', 'double-sided', 'Side', 'A', 'Side', 'B', 'DVDs', 'need', 'be', 'flipped', 'rest', 'show.It', 'must-buy', 'Spawn', 'fans', 'chance', 'see', 'characters', ""'re"", 'so', 'used', 'seeing', 'paper', 'finally', 'move', 'around', 'unfamiliar', 'series', 'looking', 'anime', 'will', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'art', 'not', 'storyline', 'Recommended', 'Spawn', 'fans', 'not', 'casual', 'viewer']",N/A

43832,AIHS800G3SLLH,078311611X,dann,"[7, 14]","Having not heard what this 'SPAWN' thing was, nor having seen the movie, nor knowing who Todd McFarlane was or what he did - I bought 'SPAWN: Ultimate Collection' ( on DVD ) with a completely open mind.Why did I buy it ? Well, why is the sky blue ? All you meteorologists out their can give me an answer I'm sure, however, I can only say that my curiosity had the better of me.Having browsed in DVD stores and on the Internet I remembered that I heard of a movie called: SPAWN. I'm not sure how the hell I remembered such a thing - but I did.Anyway, to cut a long story short I bought SPAWN: Ultimate Collection ( The three series shown on HBO in the United States ).Back to the story.I opened my package and whacked it in the DVD player. From the moment I put the DVD in the player I was submerged into a dark world. A world where I have never been before. I've seen animated series before but this didn't compare to any of those that I had seen, in my opinion.SPAWN was better..!!I have to say that I enjoyed all three series and that each series got better. Just like a good wine, SPAWN matured damn well as the series embarked on its completion.Each character developed as the shows progressed and it was obvious that SPAWN himself was going to mature as a character. The emotions, feelings, sensations, anguish, anger, hate, love and lust were symptoms of a character that HAD to mature and evolve, otherwise, this could have ( and would have ) turned into a mediocre animated cartoon. Thankfully, as each show progressed so did the characters and the plot. It is such a pity that only three series were made. It would've been interesting to see how all of the characters would have developed over a longer period.I have to say that it is a violent animation with plenty of adult language and nudity but it fits into what Todd McFarlane wanted for the HBO timeslot ( according to what I heard in his DVD interview on the flip side of the third disc of the series ). A cartoon with content to suit its audience in which case was adults over the age of 18.All in all it was brilliant and I enjoyed every second of it. The only down side of this is that there wasn't any more after the third series ( I don't think ). Such a pity because as I stated the characters were all beginning to bloom and show their worth. For me, all the three series intertwine and one cannot do without the other, hence, the third series was so good.I know there have been a couple of people that reviewed SPAWN and rubbished it. Well, to each his/her own is my opinion. You didn't like it then good on you for warning people who don't like this type of animation and content, or lack thereof. My problem is that the people who do rubbish it have to think that we are ""under-14-year-old (mentally, if not physically) male? "" .People have opinions, however, this is best kept to oneself. Generalizing in this manner typifies the immaturity of the person who writes it. It is also just pissing other people off who do actually like SPAWN and have the intelligence enough to make their own decisions on what is good and what is bad without the extra dialogue  that comes with it. If you don't like a movie point out the garbage within it but NOT the supposed immature and intellectual idiots that watch it..!!Overall, I found this series d***good and I enjoyed it heaps. If, however, you're a bit worried then I'd rent it out ( if you can...unlike where I am here in Australia ) then get it rented and make up your own mind.Finally, everything about SPAWN has got me hooked just like a happy fly-fisherman with a 5kg salmon on the end of the line. Well, that is my opinion. I'm sure there are others that will think otherwise.To each his own........",4,SPAWN: Ultimate animated series.....,993168000,"06 22, 2001",2001,3726,"['Having', 'not', 'heard', 'what', ""'SPAWN"", 'thing', 'was', 'having', 'seen', 'movie', 'knowing', 'who', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'was', 'what', 'did', 'bought', ""'SPAWN"", 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'completely', 'open', 'mind.Why', 'did', 'buy', 'Well', 'why', 'sky', 'blue', 'meteorologists', 'out', 'can', 'give', 'answer', ""'m"", 'sure', 'however', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'curiosity', 'had', 'better', 'me.Having', 'browsed', 'DVD', 'stores', 'Internet', 'remembered', 'heard', 'movie', 'called', 'SPAWN', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'hell', 'remembered', 'thing', 'did.Anyway', 'cut', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'bought', 'SPAWN', 'Ultimate', 'Collection', 'three', 'series', 'shown', 'HBO', 'United', 'States', '.Back', 'story.I', 'opened', 'package', 'whacked', 'DVD', 'player', 'moment', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'submerged', 'dark', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'have', 'never', 'been', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'animated', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'compare', 'had', 'seen', 'opinion.SPAWN', 'was', 'better..', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'three', 'series', 'series', 'got', 'better', 'Just', 'good', 'wine', 'SPAWN', 'matured', 'damn', 'well', 'series', 'embarked', 'completion.Each', 'character', 'developed', 'shows', 'progressed', 'was', 'obvious', 'SPAWN', 'was', 'going', 'mature', 'character', 'emotions', 'feelings', 'sensations', 'anguish', 'anger', 'hate', 'love', 'lust', 'were', 'symptoms', 'character', 'HAD', 'mature', 'evolve', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'would', 'have', 'turned', 'mediocre', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'Thankfully', 'show', 'progressed', 'so', 'did', 'characters', 'plot', 'such', 'pity', 'only', 'three', 'series', 'were', 'made', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'longer', 'period.I', 'have', 'say', 'violent', 'animation', 'plenty', 'adult', 'language', 'nudity', 'what', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'wanted', 'HBO', 'timeslot', 'according', 'what', 'heard', 'DVD', 'interview', 'flip', 'side', 'third', 'disc', 'series', 'cartoon', 'content', 'suit', 'audience', 'case', 'was', 'adults', 'age', '18.All', 'was', 'brilliant', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'only', 'down', 'side', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'third', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'pity', 'stated', 'characters', 'were', 'beginning', 'bloom', 'show', 'worth', 'three', 'series', 'intertwine', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'other', 'hence', 'third', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'good.I', 'know', 'have', 'been', 'couple', 'people', 'reviewed', 'SPAWN', 'rubbished', 'Well', 'own', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'good', 'warning', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'type', 'animation', 'content', 'lack', 'thereof', 'problem', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'rubbish', 'have', 'think', 'are', 'under-14-year-old', 'mentally', 'not', 'physically', 'male', '.People', 'have', 'opinions', 'however', 'best', 'kept', 'oneself', 'Generalizing', 'manner', 'immaturity', 'person', 'who', 'also', 'just', 'pissing', 'other', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'actually', 'SPAWN', 'have', 'intelligence', 'enough', 'make', 'own', 'decisions', 'what', 'good', 'what', 'bad', 'extra', 'dialogue', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'point', 'out', 'garbage', 'NOT', 'supposed', 'immature', 'intellectual', 'idiots', 'watch', 'it..', 'Overall', 'found', 'series', 'd***good', 'enjoyed', 'however', ""'re"", 'bit', 'worried', 'then', ""'d"", 'rent', 'out', 'can', 'where', 'am', 'here', 'Australia', 'then', 'get', 'rented', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind.Finally', 'everything', 'SPAWN', 'got', 'hooked', 'just', 'happy', 'fly-fisherman', '5kg', 'salmon', 'end', 'line', 'Well', 'opinion', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'others', 'will', 'think', 'own', '..']",N/A

After all the raving over this series, I was ready to buy it sight unseen, but thankfully I was able to find it for rent first, and now count myself a few dollars more fortunate.  This is some seriously stupid animation, and it's much worse than most stupid animation precisely because it passes itself off as intelligent.  The plot is pure drivel, the voice acting is horrible, and McFarlane (successfully, considering the other reviews) passes off empty shock-value imagery as avant-garde.Are you an under-14-year-old (mentally, if not physically) male?  Are you usually ashamed of the animation you do enjoy, because too many others consider it childish and moronic?  In that case, Spawn is for you; its aesthetics will meet your titillation needs and you can play off the pretense that it's intelligent, a lot easier than with most anime.If, however, your grey matter is real and your maturity level any measure beyond that of puberty, then stay away; this is exactly the kind of animation that gives animation a bad name; it just pretends not to be.

All the comic books.The Theatrical Version of Spawn's story was a Piece of S**t [aka: some of the foulest vomit to spew forth from Hollywood in a long time!]. No question there. It deviated so far from the story. There was little or no character development. It was basically an excuse for a bunch of computer graphics desk Jockeys to whack off onto film.This version however, The animated version, is perfect. Slightly different from the comic books, yes, but still enthralling.The animation is superb and the voice talent draws you into the story and the characters as deeply as any live action film ever will. The story remains dark and cynical as I believe it was meant to be and the animation reinforces this with disturbingly graphic visuals and stunning action.If you thought the movie was &quot;The Bomb!&quot; and have never read the comic books then you should probably stay away from this series.

43845,A3IBXED14SKZ8Y,078311611X,"Robert Evans ""Robert""","[3, 6]","Spawn the Animated series is based on my all time favorite Comic Book Spawn, I've bin collecting Spawn Comics sine I layed my eyes on the first issue I read(Issue 2 I think)and is still one of my favorite series.  The movie sucked ok.  Everyone knows that so what's not to know but my god the animated series was incredible.  Spawn in my opinion is one of the best comic book to an animated series ever.  Everything about the animated series is amazing.  The characters are wonderful and the villans are just plain wretched.  I first heard about the series from a friend but I didn't believe him so he gave me a copy of the tape of the first season...I was simply shocked!  This series was dark, gritty, sad, depressing, violent and just plain fun to watch.  It really does like up to the comic book.  The animation is Flawless and the story is just as good as the comic.  The Spawn series is just fantastic.  I taped every episode from all the season but Then forot those and went on to buy the Official VHS copies(I still have all 3 season on video and I simply love them and plan on getting it on DVD)and I love them!  Spawn is a very underrated series that never got noticed cause it was played late at night.  Come to think of it this and TV FUNHOUSE(use to be on on comedy central but got cancelled cause of low ratings)were played late at night.After watching the whole 1st season of Spawn I heard about the second season premiering and I was pumped for it and started watching it again on HBO.  But to make things better after a few months they decided to make a second season VHS so I immediatley went and baught the VHS copy of the 2nd season when I read about it on its website.  The season just keeps getting better and better.  And now the 3rd season which is probably the most darkest season of them all came out on HBO and then on to HBO official home video release and I baught that too.I must say I am impressed with this show.  All 3 season are brilliant and Todd McFarlane is a genious.  This show was one of the best shows ever.  This was one of the most darkest american animation to come out in the 90's too.  For anyone who is trying to look for something different other then Simpsons and SouthPark this is for you.  Spawn is a late night show on HBO so you'll have to stay up a lil late to catch it.The only complaint I have is this show ended pretty badly on the 3rd season making me and other fans wanting more...It just ends....  Poor choice of an ending..I was really expecting another season but it's bin how many years since we saw another season?..5 years!  6 years once it's 05'.  Unfortanatley McFarlane hasn't made an announcement on another season and I doublt we'll ever see one ever again.  Plus it's hard to picture another season in 05 when you have shows like Sopranos Oz and all those other shows on now..  Lets hope they do bring back another season...Here is how I rank up the seasonsSeason 1 was pretty violent and darkseason 2 had less nudity and no sexual content at all but had some pretty graphic violence and lots of profanityseason 3 had all of what season 1 had but in a more less extreame way..Overall My favorite season would have to be season 2.  It was the darkest of them all for me eventhough it's said that season 3 is the darkest season.Overall...Spawn is a very gritty tale of what the world is like and how and what a man like Al Simmons is Going through.  The series is pretty depressing, I mean the guy was killed and sent to hell only to return to earth all messed up and disfigured.  Eventhough he's suppose to be bad he's doing the world a favor and taking out the baddies but not without the consequences.  The show is no holds barred, raw and sometimes depicts some graphics material only to make things worse for poor old Al.  Spawn is dark, gritty, violent, and it is one of my all time favorites and that is why I give this series a4.9 out of 5...I didn't give it a 5 cause of the way it ended in season 3...NOTE*  Spawn is absolutley not for children.  It didn't get its Mature Audience Rating for nothing.  The shows content is worse then South park.  This show does depict Graphic use of profanity, it has some pretty bad Nudity and some sexual content, and Violence is extreamly graphic(one episode were Spawn kills a thug by puncturing his Chains through a mans mouth and out of his skull..very Violent)and lots and lots of Violence like I said.  Not for anyone under the age of 17 or 18...Lets put it this way...if this was a movie it sure as hell would have gotten an ""NC-17"" rating..I also one to mention that this show is not longer on HBO, nor can you find it on any HBO channels, you'll be lucky if you DO find it.Overall Awesome series",4,A dark and Gritty series...,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,4719,"['Spawn', 'Animated', 'series',

But otherwise its a great deal!Spawn 1: This is a bit slow in its plot. But very aggressive in its grasp of reality. A fan of  hardcore anime or spawn would like this very much. The first tape mostly  tells the story of how Spawn came to be and what his mission is, as he sees  it. In comparison to the 2nd and 3rd tapes it is a bit slow, but still  entertaining a good start to an excellent series.Spawn 2: Darker than  the first. More action, but a little creepier. One thing about this series  is that it messes with your head in confusing you about whats right and  wrong. This tape has a lot of that in it.Spawn 3: If you liked the first  two you should love this. And even if you didn't like those 2 you still  might like this one very much. The other two seem to drag on, and on, and  on. But they're still very entertaining if you watch it in segments.  However this one has a LOT more action. My favorite part is when Spawn  fights the vampire girl. Thats the closest thing in america to anime. I  think the next season, hopefully another will be made, should have a lot  more of that fighting in it. But still keep the dark and twisting plot.",5,Great deal for spawn fans!,956275200,"04 21, 2000",2000,1236,"['would', ""n't"", 'reccomend', 'buy', 'pack', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'spawn', 'series', 'otherwise', 'great', 'deal', 'Spawn', '1', 'bit', 'slow', 'plot', 'very', 'aggressive', 'grasp', 'reality', 'fan', 'hardcore', 'anime', 'spawn', 'would', 'like', 'very', 'much', 'first', 'tape', 'mostly', 'story', 'how', 'Spawn', 'came', 'be', 'what', 'mission', 'comparison', '2nd', '3rd', 'tapes', 'bit', 'slow', 'still', 'entertaining', 'good', 'start', 'excellent', 'series.Spawn', '2', 'Darker', 'first', 'More', 'action', 'little', 'creepier', 'One', 'thing', 'series', 'head', 'confusing', 'whats', 'right', 'wrong', 'tape', 'lot', 'it.Spawn', '3', 'liked', 'first', 'two', 'should', 'love', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", '2', 'still', 'might', 'like', 'one', 'very', 'much', 'other', 'two', 'seem', 'drag', ""'re"", 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'segments', 'However', 'one', 'LOT', 'more', 'action', 'favorite', 'part', 'when', 'Spawn', 'vampire', 'girl', 'closest', 'thing', 'america', 'anime', 'think', 'next', 'season', 'hopefully', 'will', 'be', 'made', 'should', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'fighting', 'still', 'keep', 'dark', 'twisting', 'plot']",N/A
43850,A3SBVTRU7301II,078311611X,"Thomas Yan Ong ""feilung888""","[15, 17]","I always liked comic book characters with a dark gothic theme.  It is why I liked Batman comics, &quot;Batman&quot; the movie, the Batman animated tv series, and &quot;The Crow&quot; movie.  When Spawn came out on Image comics, for some reason or another, it didn't catch on with me as it did with DC and Marvel comic characters.  I didn't get any of the comics and I didn't really look into it, to the point of actually starting to collect it.  Now that I have seen the animated series, I wish I had.  I was familiar with Todd McFarlane's artwork in &quot;The Amazing Spider Man&quot; and &quot;Spiderman&quot; and I thought he was one of the most talented comic artists in the business, the other great talent in my opinion, is Jim Lee illustrator of &quot;The X-men&quot; and &quot;Wildcats&quot;.  I've since outgrown comics, but a year ago, I rented the movie &quot;Spawn&quot; and I really liked it.  So I decided to rent the first animated movie.  It was pretty good so I decided to rent &quot;Spawn 2&quot; which I thought was even better than the first.  Spawn in the second installment is darker and more powerful than in the first installment.  After watching these movies and checking out the reviews on Amazon.com of &quot;Spawn 3&quot;, I decided to buy the DVD ultimate collection.  I got it and I wasn't disappointed.  The third installment was as good as &quot;Spawn 2&quot;.  The series is not comic book like with heroes fighting the bad guys, but it centers on one character's fight against himself and all the demons that haunt him upon his return to earth after spending 5 years in hell.  The series acts out like a drama with violent action sequences and sexual connotations.  Al Simmons really loves his wife Wanda and when he was sent to hell, he made a deal with the devil, known as Melboldia, to lead hell's army on earth against heaven, in turn he would get to see his beloved wife again.  When he returns to earth as hell's Spawn (offspring), he obtains amnesia and is mentally and emotionally disturbed, taking it out on the criminals that invaded his space, a dark alley he claimed as his domain.  The scenes of his presence on the roof of the abandoned Catholic church near the alley are visually stunning.  Anyway, he is accompanied by an evil clown, the Violator, which taunts him, invades his dreams, and litterly drives Spawn mad.  The Violater makes the clown in the movie &quot;It&quot; seem like a circus side show reject.  Anyway, as the series moves on, Spawn seems to get darker and the story gets more involed in the turmoil that plagues Spawn's soul.  It's a very complex story line with, Japanese quality animation, also another reason the series is appealing.  I reccomend this movie to any Spawn fan or any mature fan of comics and anime.  But I must warn that this movie series should only be viewed by adults because it is very violent, has foul language, and contains sexual situations.",5,Spawn: The Ultimate Dark Knight,970012800,"09 27, 2000",2000,2936,"['always', 'liked', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'dark', 'gothic', 'theme', 'why', 'liked', 'Batman', 'comics', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'movie', 'Batman', 'animated', 'tv', 'series', 'quot', 'Crow', 'quot', 'movie', 'When', 'Spawn', 'came', 'out', 'Image', 'comics', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'did', 'DC', 'Marvel', 'comic', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'comics', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'look', 'point', 'actually', 'starting', 'collect', 'Now', 'have', 'seen', 'animated', 'series', 'wish', 'had', 'was', 'familiar', 'Todd', 'McFarlane', 'artwork', 'quot', 'Amazing', 'Spider', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Spiderman', 'quot', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'comic', 'artists', 'business', 'other', 'great', 'talent', 'opinion', 'Jim', 'Lee', 'illustrator', 'quot', 'X-men', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wildcats', 'quot', ""'ve"", 'outgrown', 'comics', 'year', 'ago', 'rented', 'movie', 'quot', 'Spawn', 'quot', 'really', 'liked', 'decided', 'rent', 'first', 'animated', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'decided', 'rent', 'quot', 'Spawn', '2', 'quot', 'thought', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'Spawn', 'second', 'installment', 'darker', 'more', 'powerful', 'first', 'installment', 'watching', 'movies', 'checking', 'out', 'reviews', 'Amazon.com', 'quot', 'Spawn', '3', 'quot', 'decided', 'buy', 'DVD', 'ultimate', 'collection', 'got', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'third', 'installment', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Spawn', '2', 'quot', 'series', 'not', 'comic', 'book', 'heroes', 'fighting', 'bad', 'guys', 'one', 'character', 'fight', 'demons', 'haunt', 'return', 'earth', 'spending', '5', 'years', 'hell', 'series', 'out', 'drama', 'violent', 'action', 'sequences', 'sexual', 'connotations', 'Al', 'Simmons', 'really', 'wife', 'Wanda', 'when', 'was', 'sent', 'hell', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'known', 'Melboldia', 'lead', 'hell', 'army', 'earth', 'heaven', 'turn', 'would', 'get', 'see', 'beloved', 'wife', 'again', 'When', 'earth', 'hell', 'Spawn', 'offspring', 'amnesia', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'taking', 'out', 'criminals', 'invaded', 'space', 'dark', 'alley', 'claimed', 'domain', 'scenes', 'presence', 'roof', 'abandoned', 'Catholic', 'church', 'alley', 'are', 'visually', 'stunning', 'Anyway', 'accompanied', 'evil', 'clown', 'Violator', 'dreams', 'litterly', 'drives', 'Spawn', 'mad', 'Violater', 'clown', 'movie', 'quot', 'quot', 'seem', 'circus', 'side', 'show', 'reject', 'Anyway', 'series', 'Spawn', 'get', 'darker', 'story', 'more', 'involed', 'turmoil', 'Spawn', 'soul', 'very', 'complex', 'story', 'line', 'Japanese', 'quality', 'animation', 'also', 'reason', 'series', 'appealing', 'reccomend', 'movie', 'Spawn', 'fan', 'mature', 'fan', 'comics', 'anime', 'must', 'warn', 'movie', 'series', 'should', 'only', 'be', 'viewed', 'adults', 'very', 'violent', 'foul', 'language', 'sexual', 'situations']",N/A

The comics were always violent and awesome. The movie was not. But the HBO mini-series Spawn came much closer to the comic books, and achieved brilliance in American anime. The story was great, the animation was great, the voice acting was great- the whole series was put together fabulously, and it didn't go commercial like the movie. It stayed true to Spawns roots, it was dark, it was emotional, it was violent, it had a sick sense of humor.(it was not intended for kids- there is alot of cursing, nudity, violence, etc). All-in-all Spawn was one of my all-time favorite animes, American or Japanese.What about this DVD collection? Well the fact that all 3 seasons of Spawn are put into one shiny box is enough to make it great. Don't expect too much out of the bonus disc. It is an added feature but in no way should be the reason you buy this set. Buy this set because Spawn the anime was insanely good, it will put you in a dark world of intrigue that only the best movies and stories can achieve.",5,Spawn the animated series Rocked,999475200,"09 3, 2001",2001,1127,"['Forget', 'movie', 'Spawn', 'animated', 'show', 'great', 'movie', 'kinda', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'level', 'comics', 'comics', 'were', 'always', 'violent', 'awesome', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'HBO', 'mini-series', 'Spawn', 'came', 'much', 'closer', 'comic', 'books', 'achieved', 'brilliance', 'American', 'anime', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'animation', 'was', 'great', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'great-', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'fabulously', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'commercial', 'movie', 'stayed', 'true', 'Spawns', 'roots', 'was', 'dark', 'was', 'emotional', 'was', 'violent', 'had', 'sick', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'not', 'intended', 'kids-', 'alot', 'cursing', 'nudity', 'violence', 'etc', 'All-in-all', 'Spawn', 'was', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'animes', 'American', 'Japanese.What', 'DVD', 'collection', 'Well', 'fact', '3', 'seasons', 'Spawn', 'are', 'put', 'one', 'shiny', 'box', 'enough', 'make', 'great', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'bonus', 'disc', 'added', 'feature', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'Buy', 'set', 'Spawn', 'anime', 'was', 'insanely', 'good', 'will', 'put', 'dark', 'world', 'intrigue', 'only', 'best', 'movies', 'stories', 'can', 'achieve']",N/A
