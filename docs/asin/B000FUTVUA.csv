996572,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B000FUTVUA,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Part of my feeling towards this film is due to my mistake in watching it only a few weeks  following the first miniseries, 10.5, to which this a sequel. On the one hand, knowing the background of the characters and the earthquake team allowed for a smoother transition into this movie which leaps right into the action with no effort to familiarize the viewer with them. On the other hand, having recently experienced about all the smashing effects which the creators could devise, undercut the seriousness with which one could  take these similar ones (not to mention the difficulty of accepting poor President Beau Bridges going through the  same motions so soon after one saw him doing the same thing for only the West Coast).Beyond that, looking to introduce something new for the audience, they borrowed the 'burrowing through the wreckage to escape a collapsed building' scene from almost every disaster movie made in the last century, including the various Poseidon calamities. Most difficult to swallow was that this was going to be the one  that divided the country into two separate land masses with a watery  gap between them. That, for me, moved the show into the B category of 'The Monster Who Ate Tokyo'  and the like.Without going on with this listing, I can summarize by saying that, to a recent viewer of the better original,  this one seemed to be action without meaningful characters, and an overblown scenario which had no credibility.Recommendation:  for those who have seen the original, don't bother seeing this one until memories have faded sufficiently to make the action seem new but still related to remembered character development. Under those conditions it may be quite a decent watching experience. Those who did not see the original should find it entertaining but needing multiple days toi avoid earthquake fatigue.",4,Overkill,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",2013,1848,"['Part', 'feeling', 'towards', 'film', 'due', 'mistake', 'watching', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'following', 'first', 'miniseries', '10.5', 'sequel', 'one', 'hand', 'knowing', 'background', 'characters', 'earthquake', 'team', 'allowed', 'smoother', 'transition', 'movie', 'right', 'action', 'effort', 'familiarize', 'viewer', 'other', 'hand', 'having', 'recently', 'experienced', 'smashing', 'effects', 'creators', 'could', 'devise', 'undercut', 'seriousness', 'one', 'could', 'take', 'similar', 'ones', 'not', 'mention', 'difficulty', 'accepting', 'poor', 'President', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'going', 'same', 'motions', 'so', 'soon', 'one', 'saw', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'only', 'West', 'Coast', '.Beyond', 'looking', 'introduce', 'something', 'new', 'audience', 'borrowed', ""'burrowing"", 'wreckage', 'escape', 'collapsed', 'building', 'scene', 'almost', 'disaster', 'movie', 'made', 'last', 'century', 'including', 'various', 'Poseidon', 'calamities', 'Most', 'difficult', 'swallow', 'was', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'divided', 'country', 'two', 'separate', 'land', 'masses', 'watery', 'gap', 'moved', 'show', 'B', 'category', ""'The"", 'Monster', 'Who', 'Ate', 'Tokyo', 'like.Without', 'going', 'listing', 'can', 'summarize', 'saying', 'recent', 'viewer', 'better', 'original', 'one', 'seemed', 'be', 'action', 'meaningful', 'characters', 'overblown', 'scenario', 'had', 'credibility.Recommendation', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'seeing', 'one', 'memories', 'have', 'faded', 'sufficiently', 'make', 'action', 'seem', 'new', 'still', 'related', 'remembered', 'character', 'development', 'conditions', 'may', 'be', 'quite', 'decent', 'watching', 'experience', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'should', 'find', 'entertaining', 'needing', 'multiple', 'days', 'toi', 'avoid', 'earthquake', 'fatigue']",10.5: Apocalypse

I suppose they were attempting to inject some frenetic action in an otherwise static story.

I looked for good points, I found few.The hammy screenplay had some natural, flowing dialog, but most of it was cumbersome and strictly B-movie material in substance and feel. Its hard to point at the screenplay or the director, it just typified all that is bad. The effects were poor, as might be expected from the Towering Inferno or Earthquake, but the movie was made much more recently...standards have increased.The story line was absurd, even compared to some of Irwin Allen's classics.Initially, I liked the jerky, 8th grade cinematography, but as the first hour came and went it became hard on the eyes.Normally, I would be able to say ""At least it was short."" It wasn't. It was very long.I actually went over in my head, areas that Oscars were awarded for, to see what I could find that I liked about it. Nothing stood out as good. There were several egregious areas, cinematography (see above), acting performances, screenplay. Even the costume design was non-existent. The highlight of the costume design was that the heroic civilian volunteers, dressed in street clothes, had pieces of tape with their names written on them for identification.Tag lines call it a ""disaster film"".

996575,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,B000FUTVUA,Erik North,"[1, 2]","There isn't a whole lot new that can be said about the 2006 two-part miniseries 10.5: APOCALYPSE that hasn't been said about its 2004 ""prequel"" (which was just 10.5), except that it's a special effects extravaganza come true, with no fidelity to scientific plausibility.  This time, an all-star cast, including Dana Delany, Beau Bridges (as the President), and Frank Langella, find that the catastrophic earthquakes that leveled Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle in the original miniseries are growing so intense that they will eventually split the continental shelf asunder, and cause parts of the United States to separate.  This, of course, requires radical and (naturally) implausible action.John Lafia, who both directed and co-wrote both this film and the original, went to great pains to declare both films to be entertainment, not to be believed.  It's just very hard, however, to get past the level of implausibility that is thrown the viewer's way in 10.5: APOCALYPSE.  As in the original, this implausibility, combined with rather lame dialogue and melodrama that makes even the much-maligned 1974 sci-fi/disaster opus EARTHQUAKE seem like Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg helmed it, weighs everything down to a large degree.But then again, the biggest reason for the existence of 10.5: APOCALPYSE, as was the case with the original, is the incredible special effects destruction sequences, this time involving Las Vegas and Houston; and the rescue sequences are done with a certain measure of credibility.  This is, as advertised, a very uneven flick, and definitely rates a zero for plausibility; but as a special effect's lover's paradise, it does indeed rate a 10.5.",3,Zero For Plausibility; 10.5 For Special Effects,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",2009,1690,"[""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'new', 'can', 'be', 'said', '2006', 'two-part', 'miniseries', '10.5', 'APOCALYPSE', ""n't"", 'been', 'said', '2004', 'prequel', 'was', 'just', '10.5', 'special', 'effects', 'extravaganza', 'come', 'true', 'fidelity', 'scientific', 'plausibility', 'time', 'all-star', 'cast', 'including', 'Dana', 'Delany', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'President', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'find', 'catastrophic', 'earthquakes', 'leveled', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Seattle', 'original', 'miniseries', 'are', 'growing', 'so', 'intense', 'will', 'eventually', 'split', 'continental', 'shelf', 'asunder', 'cause', 'parts', 'United', 'States', 'separate', 'course', 'radical', 'naturally', 'implausible', 'action.John', 'Lafia', 'who', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'film', 'original', 'went', 'great', 'pains', 'declare', 'films', 'be', 'entertainment', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'just', 'very', 'hard', 'however', 'get', 'level', 'implausibility', 'thrown', 'viewer', 'way', '10.5', 'APOCALYPSE', 'original', 'implausibility', 'combined', 'rather', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'melodrama', 'even', 'much-maligned', '1974', 'sci-fi/disaster', 'opus', 'EARTHQUAKE', 'seem', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'helmed', 'everything', 'down', 'large', 'degree.But', 'then', 'again', 'biggest', 'reason', 'existence', '10.5', 'APOCALPYSE', 'was', 'case', 'original', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'destruction', 'sequences', 'time', 'involving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Houston', 'rescue', 'sequences', 'are', 'done', 'certain', 'measure', 'credibility', 'advertised', 'very', 'uneven', 'flick', 'definitely', 'rates', 'zero', 'plausibility', 'special', 'effect', 'lover', 'paradise', 'indeed', 'rate', '10.5']",10.5: Apocalypse

It was fun on a no-brainer level and the cast, led by the very likable Kim Delaney, was at the very least capable, given what they had to work with. It sounds like I'm bashing these films, but really I'm not. I enjoyed both of them, but I have to admit this one left me slightly disappointed for two reasons. Warning, spoilers ahead!!1) The death of David Cubitt's character barely an hour into the film. I thought he was a good partner and possible love interest for Kim Delaney's character and the way that he was eliminated was ridiculous, to the point where I seriously thought they were going to bring him back towards the end, bruised but still alive. And after a short crying episode from Kim, he's never mentioned again! Not once in the whole second half of the film! Not even when her father comes back. Weird!2) The way too abrupt ending. Honestly, when I noticed that there was only three or four minutes left to the film and the fault line was still heading towards the coast, I thought ""there must be another part to this"" or perhaps the DVD inexplicably left out the ending. But no, the fault line hits the Gulf Of Mexico, the President utters a ten second speech, and the end credits pop up! Are you kidding me? What happens to the rest of the cast? Yes, the Oliver Hudson character and his wife make it (in my opinion the least interesting characters), but what about the President's daughter and the doctor she was working with? What about the woman who was heading up the rescue efforts in Las Vegas? Didn't she need closure too, considering at the beginning of the film she was still reeling from an accident a year or so prior to this? All these subplots are thrown to the wind. One almost gets the impression that the filmmakers ran out of money and just tacked on the ending.So, in conclusion, yes the film is flawed, but hey, these films aren't meant to be taken seriously, so sit down, put your brain in neutral and enjoy.",3,If You Liked The First One...,1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,2061,"['then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'one', 'practically', 'same', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'fun', 'no-brainer', 'level', 'cast', 'led', 'very', 'likable', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'was', 'very', 'least', 'capable', 'given', 'what', 'had', 'work', ""'m"", 'bashing', 'films', 'really', ""'m"", 'not', 'enjoyed', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'left', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'two', 'reasons', 'Warning', 'spoilers', 'ahead', '1', 'death', 'David', 'Cubitt', 'character', 'barely', 'hour', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'partner', 'possible', 'love', 'interest', 'Kim', 'Delaney', 'character', 'way', 'was', 'eliminated', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'point', 'where', 'seriously', 'thought', 'were', 'going', 'bring', 'back', 'end', 'bruised', 'still', 'alive', 'short', 'crying', 'episode', 'Kim', 'never', 'mentioned', 'again', 'Not', 'once', 'whole', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Not', 'even', 'when', 'father', 'back', 'Weird', '2', 'way', 'too', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'Honestly', 'when', 'noticed', 'was', 'only', 'three', 'four', 'minutes', 'left', 'film', 'fault', 'line', 'was', 'still', 'heading', 'coast', 'thought', 'must', 'be', 'part', 'perhaps', 'DVD', 'inexplicably', 'left', 'out', 'ending', 'fault', 'line', 'Gulf', 'Mexico', 'President', 'utters', 'ten', 'second', 'speech', 'end', 'credits', 'pop', 'up', 'Are', 'kidding', 'What', 'rest', 'cast', 'Yes', 'Oliver', 'Hudson', 'character', 'wife', 'make', 'opinion', 'least', 'interesting', 'characters', 'what', 'President', 'daughter', 'doctor', 'was', 'working', 'What', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'heading', 'up', 'rescue', 'efforts', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Did', ""n't"", 'need', 'closure', 'too', 'considering', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'reeling', 'accident', 'year', 'so', 'prior', 'subplots', 'are', 'thrown', 'wind', 'One', 'almost', 'impression', 'filmmakers', 'ran', 'money', 'just', 'tacked', 'ending.So', 'conclusion', 'yes', 'film', 'flawed', 'hey', 'films', 'are', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'sit', 'down', 'put', 'brain', 'neutral', 'enjoy']",10.5: Apocalypse

Nowadays, they produce rubbish like '10.5', an unmitigated disaster in every sense of the word, in which an earthquake in Seattle triggers a sequence of equally devastating tremors - each one worse than the last - which seismologist Kim Delaney believes will culminate in a massive, landscape-altering quake along the West Coast. Naturally, the l-o-n-g bits between disaster set-pieces (including the destruction of San Francisco and a spectacular climactic deluge) are populated with boring characters mouthing the usual soap opera clich&eacute;s, while the scenes of destruction are as dramatic as they are scientifically unsound (ie. there's no such thing as a '10.5' earthquake; the Golden Gate Bridge was built to withstand even the most violent tremor, and will NOT collapse during seismic activity; nuclear explosions CANNOT seal faults in the earth's surface, etc.).The script is utterly predictable throughout (virtually every character is divided from their loved ones, either geographically or emotionally, yet the quakes bring them together in the end and, yep, make them all better people as a consequence - puh-leeze!!), and Beau Bridges plays the President with such overstated 'fortitude' and 'compassion', he comes off looking like some godawful televangelist, and is just as convincing. Even worse, David Foreman's largely hand-held camera-work - a swirling mess of zooms and zip-pans, borrowed from TV's ""NYPD Blue"" and designed to convey a sense of realism where none exists - seems calculated to drive viewers up the wall. The much-heralded visual effects are only intermittently successful, and most of 'em look like what they are - CGI images (EARTHQUAKE, SAN FRANCISCO and THE BIG ONE: THE GREAT LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE contain much better depictions of widespread devastation).

Then I found this sequel and without seeing it I ordered it.I love the movie! Plenty of special effects and there's always something going on. It's a long movie but well worth the time and you won't be bored if you like disaster films. So why did I rate it only 3 stars? After watching this movie my first thought was, what happened to the soundtrack! When I saw the ocean pulling back from the shore I didn't expect it to sound like a wind tunnel test done in a tin can. (this is at the beginning of the movie so I'm not giving anything away) Voices come through fine but the special effects are confusing to the mind. Your eyes see one thing and you hear something completely different.The original 10.5 was put out by Lions Gate Films. The 10.5 Apocalypse on Amazon says the DVD is put out by Platinum Disc? but my DVD was put out by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. I contacted them about the soundtrack and received an email today stating that they are aware of the soundtrack problem and IF they ever reissue this movie the problem will be fixed. But the DVDs they put out there are defective.So I say 5 Stars for the movie, 3 Stars for the awful soundtrack. If the DVD you order is put out by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, I feel you should know about the defect up front, not after you buy it.
