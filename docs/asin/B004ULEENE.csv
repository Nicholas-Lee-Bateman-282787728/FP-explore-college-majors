1428115,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B004ULEENE,David Baldwin,"[6, 6]","The high point of this flick is Lynda Carter bares one breast.  That's right one breast.  So impressed were the makers of this ho-hum affair of this singular shot of Carter's mammary gland that they used it twice.  Carter, the selling point here for those who went through puberty with ""Wonder Woman"", basically rides shotgun to Marjoe Gortner's Outlaw.  In fairness to Gortner he's pretty charismatic here.  Carter on the other hand was a more credible actress on ""Battle of the Network Stars"".  Not to lay all the blame on Carter the film is directed in fairly ham-handed fashion by Mark L. Lester, no relation to the kid who played Oliver.  Lester aspires to make a latter day ""Bonnie and Clyde"" but he doesn't meet the standards of ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry"".  The film was obviously made by film school grads because they name a deputy sheriff Abel Gance, a reference to the French silent filmmaker who made ""Napoleon"".  Not only is this affair boring it's pretentious!  I know this is standard drive-in affair but the makers should have taken their cues from Roger Corman in how to make a low-budget programmer with resonance.",2,I'm Waiting For Criterion To Issue A Version Of This Flick,1316476800,"09 20, 2011",2011,1131,"['high', 'point', 'flick', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'one', 'breast', 'right', 'one', 'breast', 'So', 'impressed', 'were', 'makers', 'ho-hum', 'affair', 'singular', 'shot', 'Carter', 'mammary', 'gland', 'used', 'twice', 'Carter', 'selling', 'point', 'here', 'who', 'went', 'puberty', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'basically', 'shotgun', 'Marjoe', 'Gortner', 'Outlaw', 'fairness', 'Gortner', 'pretty', 'charismatic', 'here', 'Carter', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'more', 'credible', 'actress', 'Battle', 'Network', 'Stars', 'Not', 'lay', 'blame', 'Carter', 'film', 'directed', 'fairly', 'ham-handed', 'fashion', 'Mark', 'L.', 'Lester', 'relation', 'kid', 'who', 'played', 'Oliver', 'Lester', 'make', 'latter', 'day', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', ""n't"", 'meet', 'standards', 'Dirty', 'Mary', 'Crazy', 'Larry', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'made', 'film', 'school', 'grads', 'name', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'Abel', 'Gance', 'reference', 'French', 'silent', 'filmmaker', 'who', 'made', 'Napoleon', 'Not', 'only', 'affair', 'boring', 'pretentious', 'know', 'standard', 'drive-in', 'affair', 'makers', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'cues', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'how', 'make', 'low-budget', 'programmer', 'resonance']",Bobbie Jo & Outlaw
1428116,A1HR2RVZO3W3F0,B004ULEENE,"E. A. Tetreault ""retrotvman07""","[1, 2]","First of all, I would like to point out that Lynda Carter regretted very much doing this movie as she had indicated in an interview.  She is completely unlike the loose and foolish character which she portrayed in that movie. She also would not have fallen for a loser like the guy she is with in the film.  She had just been chosen Miss America a few years before this film. Bob Hope himself told all the girls where the winner would stand and go and Lynda's response was; ""Where do you want me to stand?"" She was just joking of course and she wound up winning anyway rather ironically. Bob Hope was completely charmed by her and had Lynda travel and perform on his USO Christmas show that year. I happen to know that Lynda is a warm sensitive woman whose biggest love in life has always been her family.  I get upset when people speak of her feminine attributes as if her breasts are the only thing that makes her so beautiful.  All those extra parts are nothing without her truly beautiful face.  Her face has always been so angelic and naturally beautiful that she has always been the only woman who could have pulled off playing a Princess as she portrayed on Wonder Woman.  That is why Hollywood has not been successful in finding another actress who could pull off playing that character.  Lynda Carter also is very charismatic and so utterly charming and beautiful that very few other actresses could ever hold a candle to her.  Debra Winger who got her start as an actress in Wonder Woman and is very over rated, was very jealous and ungrateful for her opportunity on the show and so decided to bad mouth Lynda.  Lynda who was very surprised confronted Winger about her comments and then simply blew it off being the lady she is. More than we can say for Winger.  Lynda Carter is an accomplished actress and Singer and Wife and Mother and Larry King and millions continue to love her for right and wrong reasons.  I own all of Lynda Carters movies  but not because of her breasts but because she is something special and so inwardly beautiful as she is ecstatically.By all means watch this film but not for obvious reasons.  Watch it for entertainment only. Lynda plays a bad girl in it but she did refuse to do completely nude scenes. She just showed a bit more of herself than she ever did again in any movie and definitely not after Wonder Woman because children loved and respected and envied her.If there ever was a true Wonder Woman, it would certainly be Lynda Carter, then and now.Lynda I Love You!!!",2,Not Lynda Carters Favorite,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",2014,2517,"['First', 'would', 'like', 'point', 'out', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'regretted', 'very', 'much', 'doing', 'movie', 'had', 'indicated', 'interview', 'completely', 'loose', 'foolish', 'character', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'also', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'fallen', 'loser', 'guy', 'film', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'chosen', 'Miss', 'America', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'told', 'girls', 'where', 'winner', 'would', 'stand', 'go', 'Lynda', 'response', 'was', 'Where', 'do', 'want', 'stand', 'was', 'just', 'joking', 'course', 'wound', 'up', 'winning', 'anyway', 'rather', 'ironically', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'was', 'completely', 'charmed', 'had', 'Lynda', 'travel', 'perform', 'USO', 'Christmas', 'show', 'year', 'happen', 'know', 'Lynda', 'warm', 'sensitive', 'woman', 'biggest', 'love', 'life', 'always', 'been', 'family', 'get', 'upset', 'when', 'people', 'speak', 'feminine', 'attributes', 'breasts', 'are', 'only', 'thing', 'so', 'beautiful', 'extra', 'parts', 'are', 'nothing', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'face', 'face', 'always', 'been', 'so', 'angelic', 'naturally', 'beautiful', 'always', 'been', 'only', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'off', 'playing', 'Princess', 'portrayed', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'why', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'been', 'successful', 'finding', 'actress', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'playing', 'character', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'also', 'very', 'charismatic', 'so', 'utterly', 'charming', 'beautiful', 'very', 'few', 'other', 'actresses', 'could', 'ever', 'hold', 'candle', 'Debra', 'Winger', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'actress', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'very', 'over', 'rated', 'was', 'very', 'jealous', 'ungrateful', 'opportunity', 'show', 'so', 'decided', 'bad', 'mouth', 'Lynda', 'Lynda', 'who', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'confronted', 'Winger', 'comments', 'then', 'simply', 'blew', 'off', 'being', 'lady', 'More', 'can', 'say', 'Winger', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'Singer', 'Wife', 'Mother', 'Larry', 'King', 'millions', 'continue', 'love', 'right', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'own', 'Lynda', 'Carters', 'movies', 'not', 'breasts', 'something', 'special', 'so', 'inwardly', 'beautiful', 'ecstatically.By', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Watch', 'entertainment', 'only', 'Lynda', 'bad', 'girl', 'did', 'refuse', 'do', 'completely', 'nude', 'scenes', 'just', 'showed', 'bit', 'more', 'herself', 'ever', 'did', 'again', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'children', 'loved', 'respected', 'envied', 'her.If', 'ever', 'was', 'true', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'would', 'certainly', 'be', 'Lynda', 'Carter', 'then', 'now.Lynda', 'Love']",Bobbie Jo & Outlaw
