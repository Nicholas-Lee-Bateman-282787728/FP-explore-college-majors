So why does this film get four stars, despite being in the first or second gear throughout?Because, the script is excellent, the typical characters in a typical storyline are in familiar settings, thoroughly transformed. Wilshire boulevard was never like this. Mansions of the famous or the homes of the rich cry to be called those in the film. Dr. Henry Carter's back yard (?) belongs at a trailer park or in the so-so districts of London.Kevin Spacey is not a memorable shrink, Keke Palmer is not a believable highschool student. Only the dealer appears real, until the end.So it is people and places and events seen through the smoke of burning weed, and acted and directed beautifully with some very memorable lines.My major criticism was the large cameo role of Robin Williams. he just did not go with the rest of the characters and was in fact too much Robin williams and too clearly seen. Fortunately the weed smoke came back immediately and his role was very quickly forgotten.Just a note, if you like straight forward and fast moving films you will not like ""Shrink""",4,"Stereotypes Lost in Life, in Their Minds and on the Screen",1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1152,"['storyline', 'typical', 'characters', 'are', 'typical', 'ending', 'typical', 'So', 'why', 'film', 'get', 'four', 'stars', 'being', 'first', 'second', 'gear', 'script', 'excellent', 'typical', 'characters', 'typical', 'storyline', 'are', 'familiar', 'settings', 'thoroughly', 'transformed', 'Wilshire', 'boulevard', 'was', 'never', 'Mansions', 'famous', 'homes', 'rich', 'cry', 'be', 'called', 'film', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Carter', 'back', 'yard', 'trailer', 'park', 'so-so', 'districts', 'London.Kevin', 'Spacey', 'not', 'memorable', 'shrink', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'not', 'believable', 'highschool', 'student', 'Only', 'dealer', 'real', 'end.So', 'people', 'places', 'events', 'seen', 'smoke', 'burning', 'weed', 'acted', 'directed', 'beautifully', 'very', 'memorable', 'lines.My', 'major', 'criticism', 'was', 'large', 'cameo', 'role', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'rest', 'characters', 'was', 'fact', 'too', 'much', 'Robin', 'williams', 'too', 'clearly', 'seen', 'Fortunately', 'weed', 'smoke', 'came', 'back', 'immediately', 'role', 'was', 'very', 'quickly', 'forgotten.Just', 'note', 'like', 'straight', 'forward', 'fast', 'moving', 'films', 'will', 'not', 'Shrink']",Shrink

The opening scenes give the impression that we'll be watching an acutely observed, somber but darkly comic ensemble piece. But after an hour it starts to become doubtful that the threads will be connected, or that the movie has even remembered all of the characters it earlier introduced. Each performance is wonderfully credible and developed, but the excitement of an ensemble movie comes from the dramatic interaction, and this movie doesn't deliver that. It's the exact opposite of Swimming With Sharks, in that, as portrayed here, Hollywood people are: ultimately all looking out for each other; are basically decent; and will overcome their personal problems with minimal effort.

1274153,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B002K52G8W,Brian E. Erland,"[7, 11]","The 2008 film 'Shrink' is a dark comedy bent on attacking the multitude of facades, private and personal, that separate us from our innermost feelings, needs and desires. Considering the subject matter what better location is there to confront the unreality of life, why Los Angeles of course. And surely what profession among all possible professions would be best suited to serve as the ultimate hiding place for someone hiding from himself? Lets say it together, a psychiatrist. That leaves one final, essential element to complete the equation. Amongst all the great actors who have the ability to emote angst, loneliness and utter desolation who would you think is perfect for the role. You're right again, Kevin Spacey. Wasn't that easy?Synopsis: Dr. Henry Carter (Spacey) appears to be a successful, self-realized shrink on the outside. He runs a thriving practice and has written a recent best selling book on how to be happy. However when he steps out of the public eye his true nature surfaces. The death of his wife still haunts him. Most people think she died by accident, but he knows it was suicide. He finds himself unable to come to terms with her actions and struggles with undefined guilt and depression. When away from work and book promotions he lives in self imposed isolation, spending his time drinking and smoking pot. He is anything but happy and fulfilled.As you would expect, his private failures and professional success eventually collide and rise to the surface with disastrous results. As chaos abounds two new female patients come into his life. One is a beautiful woman trapped in a bad marriage, the other a young girl dealing with her mothers suicide. Dr. Carter sees in these two a second chance for redemption and happiness. Helping them just might provide the antidote enabling him to reconnect with humanity and a reason to live.Critique: This is Spacey doing what Spacey does best. No one can convey inner angst as well as he can, he's Mr. Existential of the 21st century. Unfortunately there's really nothing here that you haven't seen Spacey do before. The same can be said for the rest of the film as well. The production values and cast are solid, it's definitely a quality movie. However like Spacey there's nothing new forthcoming. You know exactly where the storyline is going long before you get there. Rent this one, but buy 'American Beauty'.",3,"""Let The Healing Begin ~ Happiness Is A Word For A Feeling""",1257120000,"11 2, 2009",2009,2392,"['2008', 'film', 'dark', 'comedy', 'bent', 'attacking', 'multitude', 'facades', 'private', 'personal', 'separate', 'innermost', 'feelings', 'needs', 'desires', 'Considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'what', 'better', 'location', 'there', 'confront', 'unreality', 'life', 'why', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'course', 'surely', 'what', 'profession', 'possible', 'professions', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'suited', 'serve', 'ultimate', 'hiding', 'place', 'someone', 'hiding', 'Lets', 'say', 'together', 'psychiatrist', 'one', 'final', 'essential', 'element', 'complete', 'equation', 'Amongst', 'great', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'ability', 'emote', 'angst', 'loneliness', 'utter', 'desolation', 'who', 'would', 'think', 'perfect', 'role', ""'re"", 'right', 'again', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'Was', ""n't"", 'easy', 'Synopsis', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Carter', 'Spacey', 'be', 'successful', 'self-realized', 'shrink', 'outside', 'thriving', 'practice', 'written', 'recent', 'best', 'selling', 'book', 'how', 'be', 'happy', 'However', 'when', 'public', 'eye', 'true', 'nature', 'surfaces', 'death', 'wife', 'still', 'Most', 'people', 'think', 'died', 'accident', 'was', 'suicide', 'unable', 'come', 'terms', 'actions', 'struggles', 'undefined', 'guilt', 'depression', 'When', 'away', 'work', 'book', 'promotions', 'self', 'imposed', 'isolation', 'spending', 'time', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'pot', 'anything', 'happy', 'fulfilled.As', 'would', 'expect', 'private', 'failures', 'professional', 'success', 'eventually', 'collide', 'rise', 'surface', 'disastrous', 'results', 'chaos', 'abounds', 'two', 'new', 'female', 'patients', 'come', 'life', 'One', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'trapped', 'bad', 'marriage', 'other', 'young', 'girl', 'dealing', 'mothers', 'suicide', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'two', 'second', 'chance', 'redemption', 'happiness', 'Helping', 'just', 'might', 'provide', 'antidote', 'enabling', 'reconnect', 'humanity', 'reason', 'live.Critique', 'Spacey', 'doing', 'what', 'Spacey', 'best', 'one', 'can', 'convey', 'inner', 'angst', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'Mr.', 'Existential', '21st', 'century', 'Unfortunately', 'really', 'nothing', 'here', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Spacey', 'do', 'before', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'rest', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'production', 'values', 'cast', 'are', 'solid', 'definitely', 'quality', 'movie', 'However', 'Spacey', 'nothing', 'new', 'forthcoming', 'know', 'exactly', 'where', 'storyline', 'going', 'long', 'get', 'there', 'Rent', 'one', 'buy', ""'American"", 'Beauty']",Shrink

This is the first time, since his Oscar winning turn in AMERICAN BEAUTY, that I've felt the thrill again of watching a character actor at the top of his game.  He plays Dr. Henry Carter, a psychiatrist at the peak of his career in Hollywood, who has been brought low by the suicide of his wife. This is about the worst thing that can happen to a man of his professional calling as it signals his massive failure on every level as both human being and professional.  Worse yet, he comes from a family of psychiatrists! As he takes to pot in a major way and sleeps out on his diving board, his family and friends stage an intervention for him and his fury knows no bounds. However, he keeps seeing his patients and, ironically, it is his patients who begin to bring him back to the land of the living. Robin Williams plays one of these patients, a movie star who believes he is a sex addict instead of an alcoholic, parallel to his own real life at this point in time.

With a focus on ""the biz"", we follow an agent, a male and a female film star, a valet who wants to be a screenwriter, a drug pusher who supplies several of them with their daily fix, and a disturbed girl who likes to view movies. This self absorbed narcissistic type of film could only be made about Hollywood, but for someone who is not in ""the biz"" it's all very depressing and uninteresting.The deadly dull topic is not helped by poor performances from virtually everyone involved, although some space needs to be given to Robin Williams who is far worse than most. At least Kevin Spacey doesn't chew up the scenery, as he has in some other films (e.g., ""Casino Jack"", ""Swimming with Sharks"").The film is directed by Jonas Pate whose main credits are TV. Thomas Moffett is the writer and he plays a writer in the film (how original!). This was his second time out as a writer/actor, and while the writing is terrible, he's not a bad actor and puts in one of the better performances in what is otherwise a clearly unenthusiastic bunch.The film has 7 producers, which is almost always a red flag. Lukas Ettlin handles the photography, which is up to the standard of the acting. The only thing worse than the script, acting, and photography is the audio, which at times is completely incomprehensible. On second thought, maybe that's not a fault with this particular flick.I can't tell you how many times I thought about turning this off, but I was compelled by the belief that something this bad had to have an ending that was really good and would somehow redeem the entire film.

Hence he finds it difficult to deal with patients with similar problems; any advice he gives will automatically seem invalid.  Director Joshua Pate weaves an ensemble tale around this central plot-line involving a variety of characters, including an adolescent girl with similar problems (Keke Palmer), a perpetually stoned actor (Jack Huston), and a has-been star with an irresistible penchant for making love (Robin Williams in a substantial but uncredited role).  The story weaves its way towards an expected conclusion, with Carter eventually discovering an alternative after having had a brush with death.  Nonetheless there are plenty of incidental pleasures along the way, with strong performances from Spacey, Williams, and Saffron Burrows as a female leading actor trying to cope with getting old.

Menta, Jr.","[33, 39]","Kevin Spacey shines in his portrayal of a Los Angeles psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Carter, who's been hitting the booze and drugs pretty hard in the wake of a personal tragedy.  After an intervention by his family and friends falls flat, the doctor's father (also a psychiatrist, and played by the great Robert Loggia), sets his son up with a new patient, a teenage girl named Jemma (Keke Palmer) who has faced a tragedy similar to Carter's, in the hope that the case will help his son re-engage in life and better confront his own grief.  Despite seeing right through the plan, Dr. Carter grudgingly takes on the case and it indeed starts him back on a more positive, functional path, though things don't happen easily.An ensemble cast, mostly playing Dr. Carter's other patients, also slowly get drawn into the main story, either directly or through the comments they make about their own problems during their sessions with Carter.  An unbilled Robin Williams is a particular standout in his small but memorable role as a movie star confronting his own personal issues (everyone has them in this movie).  Indeed, many of Dr. Carter's patients are in the movie business in some way, bringing about an interesting juxtaposition of intense personal issues on the part of some patients (and Carter) and quirky Hollywood shallowness from others.""Shrink"" is mostly serious, but it's lightened a little by Dr. Carter's wry, dry sense of humor (perfectly brought to life by Mr. Spacey), which the character can't help displaying even when he's hurting and wants to be left alone.  Keke Palmer's Jemma is also a ray of sunshine in the film, despite the seriousness of her own issues.  And, as previously noted, the occasional Hollywood humor, centering around the often insane world of movie deals and star egos, also keeps things from getting too heavy.I was lucky enough to see ""Shrink"" on the big screen during its brief and limited theatrical run (thank you, ""Ritz Five"" theater in Philadelphia!), and heartily recommend it for home viewing when it comes out on DVD.",4,Terrific ensemble piece anchored by a strong Kevin Spacey performance,1250035200,"08 12, 2009",2009,2059,"['Kevin', 'Spacey', 'shines', 'portrayal', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Carter', 'who', 'been', 'hitting', 'booze', 'drugs', 'pretty', 'hard', 'wake', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'intervention', 'family', 'friends', 'flat', 'doctor', 'father', 'also', 'psychiatrist', 'played', 'great', 'Robert', 'Loggia', 'son', 'up', 'new', 'patient', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Jemma', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'who', 'faced', 'tragedy', 'similar', 'Carter', 'hope', 'case', 'will', 'help', 'son', 're-engage', 'life', 'better', 'confront', 'own', 'grief', 'seeing', 'right', 'plan', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'grudgingly', 'case', 'indeed', 'back', 'more', 'positive', 'functional', 'path', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'happen', 'easily.An', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'mostly', 'playing', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'other', 'patients', 'also', 'slowly', 'get', 'drawn', 'main', 'story', 'directly', 'comments', 'make', 'own', 'problems', 'sessions', 'Carter', 'unbilled', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'particular', 'standout', 'small', 'memorable', 'role', 'movie', 'star', 'confronting', 'own', 'personal', 'issues', 'everyone', 'movie', 'Indeed', 'many', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'patients', 'are', 'movie', 'business', 'way', 'bringing', 'interesting', 'juxtaposition', 'intense', 'personal', 'issues', 'part', 'patients', 'Carter', 'quirky', 'Hollywood', 'shallowness', 'others', 'Shrink', 'mostly', 'serious', 'lightened', 'little', 'Dr.', 'Carter', 'wry', 'dry', 'sense', 'humor', 'perfectly', 'brought', 'life', 'Mr.', 'Spacey', 'character', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'displaying', 'even', 'when', 'hurting', 'be', 'left', 'alone', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'Jemma', 'also', 'ray', 'sunshine', 'film', 'seriousness', 'own', 'issues', 'previously', 'noted', 'occasional', 'Hollywood', 'humor', 'centering', 'often', 'insane', 'world', 'movie', 'deals', 'star', 'egos', 'also', 'things', 'getting', 'too', 'heavy.I', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'Shrink', 'big', 'screen', 'brief', 'limited', 'theatrical', 'run', 'Ritz', 'Five', 'theater', 'Philadelphia', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'home', 'viewing', 'when', 'out', 'DVD']",Shrink

1274166,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B002K52G8W,Luke Killion,"[1, 1]","""Shrink"" is a 2009 film starring Kevin Spacey, rounded out by an excellent ensemble cast that eventually merges together for an intelligent and satisfying conclusion. In some ways it is like the classic Quentin Tarrantino movie ""Pulp Fiction"" in its use of multiple story lines that intersect at somewhat unlikely places. ""Shrink"" is by no means a mob movie, but the directorial device used by Jonas Pate brings a unique take on LA and its wackyier side through a hodgepodge of original and well acted characters.Spacey's chacter of Dr. Henry Carter is a slight throwback to the role of Lester Burnham in perhaps his most decorated movie, 1999's ""American Beauty"".Carter is very similar to Burnham; if Burnham had gotten divorced and moved to LA to become a psychiatrist, the character of Carter would most likely be the result.The movie begins with a puffy-faced Carter waking up and doing his morning routine, all the while chainsmoking (both marijuana and cigarettes), which is quite a feat when he decides to shave his scruffy face. Carter is clearly suffering from a mental and physical burnout, but it is suprising that when he arrives at his sheik LA doctor's office (looking much more sanitized), his demeanor is sharp and his clients are some of Hollywood's bigger players.This movie is definately about mental health, but more specifically, the kind of psychological distress that is commonly found in LA. There are numerous patients that fit the mold of a decadent star in the entertainment business; Robin Williams plays a major motion picture star with fears about cheating on his wife and sexual deviance; Dallas Roberts is a germaphobe talent agent (an OCD version of Ari from Entourage) and Jack Huston is an Irish action star with the all too often drug and alcohol addiction and subsequent hospitalizations (a la Lindsey Lohan) for ""heat exhaustion"". His character is slightly reminiscent of a Colin Farrel type. Huston is one of my favorite actors in this piece; his range is enormous, as he also plays Richard Harrow in HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"", a gravelly voiced bootlegg enforcer who must wear a grotesque mask due to his WWI wound. Jesse Plemons has a few short but memorable scenes as Jesus, a nerdy looking ""smoke"" dealer who supplies Carter with his marijuana. Plemons was recently introducted to the AMC hit series ""Breaking Bad"" as Todd, an addition to the methamphetamine syndicate that is the basis of the show (which also has powerful psychological themes interlaced with drug use and distribution). Plemons is great as an innocent looking ""Leave it to Beaver"" type kid, but with a darkly humorous and sinister mean streak. Keke Palmer rounds out the cast as an ordinary young black girl struggling with a death in the family, who Carter attempts to assist (his father asked him to do it pro bono) when she sends out a cry for help through misbehavior.This movie had alot of ""bright side"" kind of perspectives and how life can be improved through genuine artistic expression, though it deals with some very serious subject matter concerning people's emotions and how they cope with them in a stressfull and competitive environment. LA is obvioulsy known for wild parties and excesses, which is part and parcel of the entertainment business for many rock stars and big shots. This film portrays how these types of issues can effect different people, from the biggest Hollywood stars, to ordinary everyday people, and that in every life, there is a story worth telling.",4,Spacey as burned out L.A. shrink to the stars,1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2012,3498,"['Shrink', '2009', 'film', 'starring', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'rounded', 'out', 'excellent', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'eventually', 'together', 'intelligent', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'ways', 'classic', 'Quentin', 'Tarrantino', 'movie', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'use', 'multiple', 'story', 'lines', 'intersect', 'somewhat', 'unlikely', 'places', 'Shrink', 'mob', 'movie', 'directorial', 'device', 'used', 'Jonas', 'Pate', 'unique', 'take', 'LA', 'wackyier', 'side', 'hodgepodge', 'original', 'well', 'acted', 'characters.Spacey', 'chacter', 'Dr.', 'Henry', 'Carter', 'slight', 'throwback', 'role', 'Lester', 'Burnham', 'perhaps', 'most', 'decorated', 'movie', '1999', 'American', 'Beauty', '.Carter', 'very', 'similar', 'Burnham', 'Burnham', 'had', 'gotten', 'divorced', 'moved', 'LA', 'become', 'psychiatrist', 'character', 'Carter', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'result.The', 'movie', 'puffy-faced', 'Carter', 'waking', 'up', 'doing', 'morning', 'routine', 'while', 'chainsmoking', 'marijuana', 'cigarettes', 'quite', 'feat', 'when', 'shave', 'scruffy', 'face', 'Carter', 'clearly', 'suffering', 'mental', 'physical', 'burnout', 'suprising', 'when', 'sheik', 'LA', 'doctor', 'office', 'looking', 'much', 'more', 'sanitized', 'demeanor', 'sharp', 'clients', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'bigger', 'players.This', 'movie', 'definately', 'mental', 'health', 'more', 'specifically', 'kind', 'psychological', 'distress', 'commonly', 'found', 'LA', 'are', 'numerous', 'patients', 'fit', 'mold', 'decadent', 'star', 'entertainment', 'business', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'star', 'fears', 'cheating', 'wife', 'sexual', 'deviance', 'Dallas', 'Roberts', 'germaphobe', 'talent', 'agent', 'OCD', 'version', 'Ari', 'Entourage', 'Jack', 'Huston', 'Irish', 'action', 'star', 'too', 'often', 'drug', 'alcohol', 'addiction', 'subsequent', 'hospitalizations', 'la', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'heat', 'exhaustion', 'character', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'Colin', 'Farrel', 'type', 'Huston', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'piece', 'range', 'enormous', 'also', 'Richard', 'Harrow', 'HBO', 'Boardwalk', 'Empire', 'gravelly', 'voiced', 'bootlegg', 'enforcer', 'who', 'must', 'wear', 'grotesque', 'mask', 'due', 'WWI', 'wound', 'Jesse', 'Plemons', 'few', 'short', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'Jesus', 'nerdy', 'looking', 'smoke', 'dealer', 'who', 'Carter', 'marijuana', 'Plemons', 'was', 'recently', 'introducted', 'AMC', 'hit', 'series', 'Breaking', 'Bad', 'Todd', 'addition', 'methamphetamine', 'syndicate', 'basis', 'show', 'also', 'powerful', 'psychological', 'themes', 'interlaced', 'drug', 'use', 'distribution', 'Plemons', 'great', 'innocent', 'looking', 'Leave', 'Beaver', 'type', 'kid', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'sinister', 'mean', 'streak', 'Keke', 'Palmer', 'out', 'cast', 'ordinary', 'young', 'black', 'girl', 'struggling', 'death', 'family', 'who', 'Carter', 'attempts', 'assist', 'father', 'asked', 'do', 'pro', 'bono', 'when', 'out', 'cry', 'help', 'misbehavior.This', 'movie', 'had', 'alot', 'bright', 'side', 'kind', 'perspectives', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'improved', 'genuine', 'artistic', 'expression', 'very', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'concerning', 'people', 'emotions', 'how', 'cope', 'stressfull', 'competitive', 'environment', 'LA', 'obvioulsy', 'known', 'wild', 'parties', 'excesses', 'part', 'parcel', 'entertainment', 'business', 'many', 'rock', 'stars', 'big', 'shots', 'film', 'how', 'types', 'issues', 'can', 'effect', 'different', 'people', 'biggest', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'ordinary', 'everyday', 'people', 'life', 'story', 'worth', 'telling']",Shrink

I found myself becoming increasingly bored with the movie and I was actually tempted to stop watching it--and that's rare for me when it comes to movies! The cinematography and the choreography, to be fair, as well done; and Kevin Spacey gives a great performance as a rather disturbed and drug addicted psychologist to the stars in Hollywood Dr. Henry Carter along with Keke Palmer as Jemma, a troubled teen with a similar problem to Carter's. Jack Huston also does a great job as Shamus, a big new name in Hollywood who's got a real problem with alcohol and drugs.The movie is like an airplane that taxis down the runway as if it wee going to take off--you hear the jets turn up their power but then all of a sudden things slow down rapidly and the plane comes to a screeching halt. You can almost forget about the plot--it's not well done and it's very contrived although it has a few good moments. Worse yet, there are stereotypes in this movie that don't exactly help--an Irish alcoholic, a Hollywood agent with extreme anxiety, anger and a very bad case of obsessive compulsive disorder and more. Ouch!However, if you do like this movie, you'll be hanging on to see what happens to Jemma, Dr. Carter, Shamus and the other characters including aspiring writer Jeremy (Mark Webber), Patrick (Dallas Roberts) the Hollywood agent and his assistant Daisy (Pell James). There's also ""Jesus (Jesse Plemons),"" the drug dealer from whom Henry Carter buys his marijuana. Robin Williams is also one of the better actors in this film; he plays one of Carter's patients extremely well and he is somewhat underutilized, unfortunately. There is a very brief appearance by Gore Vidal.The DVD comes with extras. There are deleted scenes; interviews with producer Braxton Pope and director Jonas Pate; a Jackson Browne ""Here"" music video and the theatrical trailer in case you're interested to see that, too.Overall, Shrink is little more than an average movie that you might want to skip.

The performances are so nuanced and lived-in that there is such an air of reality to the proceedings. Kevin Spacey gives an incredible performance (one of his best, personally) and the amazing Keke Palmer delivers in spades. The interweaving stories work for the most part, which says a lot for that type of film. Sometimes movies like this can be contrived, and ""Shrink"" can be, but for extremely fleeting moments. The vignettes are stung together in a way that is only believable for Los Angeles (the ending for sure), and in that it works. The cinematography is inspired (with one hell of a master shot) and is like a whole other character.
