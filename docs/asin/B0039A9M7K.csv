Both books were excellent and these movies are very good adaptations of the original novels. The Needle stars Donald Sutherland in one of his most compelling roles and William Hurt is a very convincing Moscow (MVD) homicide cop. Gorky Park effectively captures the pathos and political corruption of the dying Soviet colossus and the Needle is an edge-of-the-seat thriller of the British MI5 chasing a deadly Nazi spy. Both movies deserve multiple viewings: first, just to enjoy the stories; later, to appreciate the art of good movie-making.",5,Two Classic Thrillers in one case,1381536000,"10 12, 2013",2013,665,"['Two', 'favorite', 'authors', 'are', 'cinematized', 'single', 'product', 'Ken', 'Follett', ""'Needle"", 'Martin', 'Cruz', 'Smith', ""'Gorky"", 'books', 'were', 'excellent', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'adaptations', 'original', 'novels', 'Needle', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'roles', 'William', 'Hurt', 'very', 'convincing', 'Moscow', 'MVD', 'homicide', 'cop', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'effectively', 'pathos', 'political', 'corruption', 'dying', 'Soviet', 'colossus', 'Needle', 'edge-of-the-seat', 'thriller', 'British', 'MI5', 'chasing', 'deadly', 'Nazi', 'spy', 'movies', 'deserve', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'first', 'just', 'enjoy', 'stories', 'later', 'appreciate', 'art', 'good', 'movie-making']",N/A

1333778,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B0039A9M7K,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 5]","Michael Apted's ""Gorky Park"" is a period classic, an exciting and dangerous expedition into conspiracy, double-dealing, mistrust, and fear.  When Investigator Arkady Renko finds three corpses carefully arranged in a Moscow park, everything seems routine, until he sees that their faces have been flayed off.  This leads him into a byzantine plot involving corrupt nomenklatura, an American industrialist of easy morals, and the lengths people will journey to become free.Apted creates a taut procedural about a policeman who can't ask certain questions, investigating crime in a nation where truth comes by state decree.  He paints Moscow as intense and claustrophobic, trust as a minefield, and love as a liability in a world where your life's course is decided by your superiors.  Though dated by its cinematography and buzzing electronic score, this subtle film provides remarkable insight into human dread.Unfortunately, it's yoked to a snoozer like ""Eye of the Needle.""  Henry Faber's British accent and manners disguise his German loyalties.  When he seizes possession of facts which could abort D-Day, he runs, with MI-5 in pursuit.  A boating accident strands him in a crippled crofter's farm off Scotland, where a whirlwind romance with the crofter's wife leads to a fevered chase and a desperate showdown, with Normandy at stake.Donald Sutherland seldom mentions this movie, for obvious reasons.  Kate Nelligan has an Ingrid Bergman-like innocence that seems wasted in a film which sees her in exclusively sexual terms.  This movie begins plot threads, then forgets them.  It races through a checklist of thriller clich&eacute;s without pausing to think about any.  Supposedly, George Lucas picked director Richard Marquand as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; because of this film, but I can't see why.Discount stores display this disc for impulse purchase, and ""Gorky Park"" clearly gets top billing because it's the good film.  This single-disc set has no special features, and no subtitles, which can be occasionally frustrating.  This disc makes a dirt-cheap way to grab ""Gorky Park,"" which can be tough to find.  I really enjoy that film.  But I see no reason to ever watch ""Eye of the Needle"" again.",4,One Good Film,1294704000,"01 11, 2011",2011,2207,"['Michael', 'Apted', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'period', 'classic', 'exciting', 'dangerous', 'expedition', 'conspiracy', 'double-dealing', 'mistrust', 'fear', 'When', 'Investigator', 'Arkady', 'Renko', 'three', 'corpses', 'carefully', 'arranged', 'Moscow', 'park', 'everything', 'routine', 'have', 'been', 'flayed', 'off', 'byzantine', 'plot', 'involving', 'corrupt', 'nomenklatura', 'American', 'industrialist', 'easy', 'morals', 'lengths', 'people', 'will', 'journey', 'become', 'free.Apted', 'creates', 'taut', 'procedural', 'policeman', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ask', 'certain', 'questions', 'investigating', 'crime', 'nation', 'where', 'truth', 'state', 'decree', 'Moscow', 'intense', 'claustrophobic', 'trust', 'minefield', 'love', 'liability', 'world', 'where', 'life', 'course', 'decided', 'superiors', 'dated', 'cinematography', 'buzzing', 'electronic', 'score', 'subtle', 'film', 'remarkable', 'insight', 'human', 'dread.Unfortunately', 'yoked', 'snoozer', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'Henry', 'Faber', 'British', 'accent', 'manners', 'disguise', 'German', 'loyalties', 'When', 'possession', 'facts', 'could', 'abort', 'D-Day', 'MI-5', 'pursuit', 'boating', 'accident', 'crippled', 'crofter', 'farm', 'Scotland', 'where', 'whirlwind', 'romance', 'crofter', 'wife', 'fevered', 'chase', 'desperate', 'showdown', 'Normandy', 'stake.Donald', 'Sutherland', 'seldom', 'mentions', 'movie', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Ingrid', 'Bergman-like', 'innocence', 'wasted', 'film', 'exclusively', 'sexual', 'terms', 'movie', 'plot', 'threads', 'then', 'checklist', 'thriller', 'clich', 'eacute', 'pausing', 'think', 'Supposedly', 'George', 'Lucas', 'picked', 'director', 'Richard', 'Marquand', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why.Discount', 'stores', 'display', 'disc', 'impulse', 'purchase', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'clearly', 'top', 'billing', 'good', 'film', 'single-disc', 'set', 'special', 'features', 'subtitles', 'can', 'be', 'occasionally', 'frustrating', 'disc', 'dirt-cheap', 'way', 'grab', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'find', 'really', 'enjoy', 'film', 'see', 'reason', 'ever', 'watch', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'again']",N/A

I have seen both movies several times on satellite TV where they were cut to fit a time slot, but they are much better on DVD.First Gorky Park is certainly one of the best political mystery films ever made and worth the purchase price on its own.  The primary characters are all too realistic and all too convincing.  In part this is due to some very good actors.  William Hurt turns in his best performance other than his work in an Accidental Tourist.  Lee Marvin is also right on and tries to match some of his many other great performances.  Even Brian Dennehy's supporting performance is very believable in this.However, this is not a movie that has to be carried by the fine acting it received.  The writing and direction is first rate as well.  Buried in this film are some subtle values of the author and some rather daring political information.  This movie reveals more about the world on a few topics than you will ever get reading the New York Times or other major news outlets, but you have to really pay attention to pick up on it.  If you like a movie well balanced with action, thought provoking dramatic acting, and that rarest of political commodities truth, then you can't help but enjoy this movie.  It deserves more than just 5 stars, and the book is even better.The second movie, The Eye of the Needle is also a very nice piece of story telling with a nice blend of action, suspense, and dramatic acting.  The Eye of the Needle is a politically correct movie with none of the subtle political daring of the first movie.  In fact it contains more than a little bit of political propaganda as do most movies about WWII.  Those who win write the history.  It does however address some basic human values that are important philosophically.  Certainly this is one of Donald Southerland's many great performances and it is an interesting story with excellent acting.However it is Kate Nelligan that turns in the most impressive acting performance.  Stephen MacKenna also turns in a nice bit of acting.  While not of the above 5 star caliber of the first movie, Eye of the Needle is well worth seeing and watching and re-watching many times.",5,Outstanding Pair of Movies........,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,2287,"['two', 'pack', 'very', 'economical', 'way', 'get', 'two', 'outstanding', 'classics', 'very', 'good', 'bargain', '12', '13', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'movies', 'several', 'times', 'satellite', 'TV', 'where', 'were', 'cut', 'fit', 'time', 'slot', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'DVD.First', 'Gorky', 'Park', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'political', 'mystery', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'purchase', 'price', 'own', 'primary', 'characters', 'are', 'too', 'realistic', 'too', 'convincing', 'part', 'due', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'William', 'Hurt', 'best', 'performance', 'other', 'work', 'Accidental', 'Tourist', 'Lee', 'Marvin', 'also', 'right', 'tries', 'match', 'many', 'other', 'great', 'performances', 'Even', 'Brian', 'Dennehy', 'supporting', 'performance', 'very', 'believable', 'this.However', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'carried', 'fine', 'acting', 'received', 'writing', 'direction', 'first', 'rate', 'well', 'Buried', 'film', 'are', 'subtle', 'values', 'author', 'rather', 'daring', 'political', 'information', 'movie', 'more', 'world', 'few', 'topics', 'will', 'ever', 'get', 'reading', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'other', 'major', 'news', 'outlets', 'have', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'pick', 'up', 'like', 'movie', 'well', 'balanced', 'action', 'thought', 'provoking', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'rarest', 'political', 'commodities', 'truth', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'just', '5', 'stars', 'book', 'even', 'better.The', 'second', 'movie', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'also', 'very', 'nice', 'piece', 'story', 'telling', 'nice', 'blend', 'action', 'suspense', 'dramatic', 'acting', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'politically', 'correct', 'movie', 'none', 'subtle', 'political', 'daring', 'first', 'movie', 'fact', 'more', 'little', 'bit', 'political', 'propaganda', 'do', 'most', 'movies', 'WWII', 'who', 'win', 'write', 'history', 'however', 'address', 'basic', 'human', 'values', 'are', 'important', 'philosophically', 'Certainly', 'one', 'Donald', 'Southerland', 'many', 'great', 'performances', 'interesting', 'story', 'excellent', 'acting.However', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'most', 'impressive', 'acting', 'performance', 'Stephen', 'MacKenna', 'also', 'nice', 'bit', 'acting', 'not', 'above', '5', 'star', 'caliber', 'first', 'movie', 'Eye', 'Needle', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'watching', 're-watching', 'many', 'times']",N/A
