1645059,ABS2A1OWX5Q8,B00CA4RZQQ,Fred Adelman,"[0, 0]",Simply crappy made-for-cable monster flick with some of the worst CGI this side of a film made by The Asylum. The title creation is laughable and the film has fade-to-blacks where the commercials were supposed to be shown.

1645062,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B00CA4RZQQ,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[4, 4]","This is your typical horror film. The first scene gives us a glimpse of the creature with a killing. We then establish characters and their relationships. Then back to the creature confrontation.Sheriff Tatum (Carl Savering) and Todd (Robert Belushi, son of James Belushi and Sandra Davenport) are the police officers  in a small southern town where there was once a gold mine. Todd has stress issues. In an early tease scene they catch two people parking: Tatum's son and Todd's sister Veronica (Evie Thompson). Todd has stress relief sessions with Theresa (Cathy Shim) while Veronica is best friends with Theresa'a sister (Olivia Ku). Their mother knows about the curse of the mine.The film is not without flaws. The history was questionable. Chinese miners in the south in 1840? Not likely. The photograph shown from that era was clearly not from that era. A half face paper filter mask for methane gas? Of course when you are dealing with a two headed gold eating creature, these are minor reality issues.I enjoyed the film which created likeable characters. Nothing to get excited about, but makes for a decent rental. 3 1/2 stars.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Off screen sex.

1645063,A31BDEUO4D8X6W,B00CA4RZQQ,wade,"[0, 3]","The basic storyline of the film is that there is a abandoned gold mine that was closed long ago after several mines were killed tragically digging for gold. several years into the future and we have a boisterous grandson of the original mine owner who has reopened the abandoned mine. Little does he know that an evil monster that is a reincarnation of the dead miners has been released on the local people. the special effects were great with this monster, and there were numerous explosions but nothing that seems to kill the monster. The local deputy sheriff and his girlfriend are the heros of this film and between their love for each other along with some oriental mysticism they both kill the evil gold monster. the way this film ended, i wonder if there will be another film made that takes off where this one ends? this movie i am sure would be liked by both guys and gals.. it is both a horror movie and has a little bit of romance, drama, and comedy",3,"just another ""run of the mill"" horror flick",1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,960,"['basic', 'storyline', 'film', 'abandoned', 'gold', 'mine', 'was', 'closed', 'long', 'ago', 'several', 'mines', 'were', 'killed', 'tragically', 'digging', 'gold', 'several', 'years', 'future', 'have', 'boisterous', 'grandson', 'original', 'mine', 'owner', 'who', 'reopened', 'abandoned', 'mine', 'Little', 'know', 'evil', 'monster', 'reincarnation', 'dead', 'miners', 'been', 'released', 'local', 'people', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'monster', 'were', 'numerous', 'explosions', 'nothing', 'kill', 'monster', 'local', 'deputy', 'sheriff', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'heros', 'film', 'love', 'other', 'oriental', 'mysticism', 'kill', 'evil', 'gold', 'monster', 'way', 'film', 'ended', 'i', 'wonder', 'will', 'be', 'film', 'made', 'off', 'where', 'one', 'movie', 'am', 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'liked', 'guys', 'gals..', 'horror', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'drama', 'comedy']",Heebie Jeebies
