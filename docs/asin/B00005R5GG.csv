677954,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00005R5GG,bookloversfriend,"[4, 12]","Why does this movie not work?  Let me count the ways.  First, the movie opens with ten minutes of slapstick, fairly decent slapstick.  Then, the slapstick is jettisoned, never to return, and the movie is serious from there on.The wife dies--off camera, of course--but that's okay, because we can't feel much for her anyway, since we never saw the couple together in a serious or sincere way.  We only saw slapstick.The character then goes running through the hospital.  This strange behavior is followed by some clich&eacute;d behavior: throwing furniture around, etc.  This behavior, I suppose, is to let us know that this character is infantile but is going to improve as the movie wears on.  He then rejects his baby.  Okay, we've all seen ""A Christmas Carol,"" so it's credible, Scrooge's father does this.  But the screenwriter didn't bother to ask himself whether we really want to see a movie about Scrooge's father.When the nanny enters the picture, it begins to have moments that are promising, but these are always dashed by some off-putting behavior or other on the part of the father.  He is shown coming to like his baby, but then unaccountably he spends day and evening away from her.  What are we supposed to make of this?Richard Grant plays this character, I suppose, as the script dictates, as a kind of screwed-up guy who hasn't a clue and who keeps changing ""color"" from one scene to the next.  So, the ""happy"" ending leaves one with a shrug.Oh, and there are two musical interludes during which the movie stops for several minutes to let us listen to the selection the writer-director has chosen for us.  Trouble is, the chosen music will not be to everyone's taste.  Extremely so, in my case.Bottom line: See this movie only if you really, REALLY like one or another of the cast.",2,strictly for fans,1159315200,"09 27, 2006",2006,1799,"['Why', 'movie', 'not', 'work', 'Let', 'count', 'ways', 'First', 'movie', 'ten', 'minutes', 'slapstick', 'fairly', 'decent', 'slapstick', 'Then', 'slapstick', 'jettisoned', 'never', 'return', 'movie', 'serious', 'on.The', 'wife', 'dies', 'camera', 'course', 'okay', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'anyway', 'never', 'saw', 'couple', 'together', 'serious', 'sincere', 'way', 'only', 'saw', 'slapstick.The', 'character', 'then', 'running', 'hospital', 'strange', 'behavior', 'followed', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'behavior', 'throwing', 'furniture', 'etc', 'behavior', 'suppose', 'let', 'know', 'character', 'infantile', 'going', 'improve', 'movie', 'then', 'baby', 'Okay', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'credible', 'Scrooge', 'father', 'screenwriter', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'ask', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'Scrooge', 'father.When', 'nanny', 'enters', 'picture', 'have', 'moments', 'are', 'promising', 'are', 'always', 'dashed', 'off-putting', 'behavior', 'other', 'part', 'father', 'shown', 'coming', 'like', 'baby', 'then', 'unaccountably', 'day', 'evening', 'away', 'What', 'are', 'supposed', 'make', 'Richard', 'Grant', 'character', 'suppose', 'script', 'kind', 'screwed-up', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'clue', 'who', 'keeps', 'changing', 'color', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'So', 'happy', 'ending', 'one', 'shrug.Oh', 'are', 'two', 'musical', 'interludes', 'movie', 'several', 'minutes', 'let', 'listen', 'selection', 'writer-director', 'chosen', 'Trouble', 'chosen', 'music', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'taste', 'Extremely', 'so', 'case.Bottom', 'line', 'See', 'movie', 'only', 'really', 'REALLY', 'one', 'cast']",N/A

Grant and Samantha Mathis, Jack's mother is played by Judi Dench; his mother-in-law by Eileen Atkins and his wacky friend by Ian McKellan -- quite an impressive cast. The beginning is very sad as it depicts a man who is wallowing in the depths of despair over his loss. Slowly he's brought to life by his growing love for his new daughter. At first, he doesn't quite know how to be a parent, but he's helped by Amy, an American girl who becomes the live-in nanny, as well as family and friends. This is ultimately a story about second chances -- not just for Jack but also for other characters who learn about both letting go of the past and reconnecting with what's important in life.",4,"Sweet story, amazing cast",1233964800,"02 7, 2009",2009,832,"['Jack', 'wife', 'childbirth', 'left', 'alone', 'take', 'care', 'newborn', 'daughter', 'Sarah', 'addition', 'spot-on', 'performances', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Jack', 'mother', 'played', 'Judi', 'Dench', 'mother-in-law', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'wacky', 'friend', 'Ian', 'McKellan', 'quite', 'impressive', 'cast', 'beginning', 'very', 'sad', 'man', 'who', 'wallowing', 'depths', 'despair', 'loss', 'Slowly', 'brought', 'life', 'growing', 'love', 'new', 'daughter', 'first', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'be', 'parent', 'helped', 'Amy', 'American', 'girl', 'who', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'as', 'well', 'family', 'friends', 'ultimately', 'story', 'second', 'chances', 'not', 'just', 'Jack', 'also', 'other', 'characters', 'who', 'learn', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'reconnecting', 'what', 'important', 'life']",N/A
