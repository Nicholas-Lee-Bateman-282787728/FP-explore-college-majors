1314218,AWTY32U87QZEF,B002ZHKZDS,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Doctor Who, especially for the new shows that have culminated in seven series so far consist of a blend of horror/sci-fi/comedy/drama with a bit of fantasy and whimsy thrown in at every turn. Given that there is so much going on in the Doctor Who universe and the scope of the story told here, there are bound to be questions resulting in potential plot holes. That said, it doesn't matter because the story is so well-written, clever, fun, executed with such boundless brilliance and energy that you can't help but love it all the same.I've said this before but John Simm(Life on Mars) is an absolute joy to watch as the Master. He was brilliant at the end of series 3, and he continues his cackling howls of insanity to astronomical levels here. He's an awesome villain. For me, he easily rivals the Daleks. I'm not just talking in terms of sheer power, but in terms of charisma and how lovably evil he is.You might remember Bernard Cribbins from that one Fawlty Towers episode about the Hotel Inspectors. We first saw him in the season 3 episode ""The Runaway Bride"", then he appeared throughout season 4 as a supporting character with very sporadic appearances here and there as Donna Noble's grandfather. In this two part special though, he plays a very important role as the emotional support for the doctor and the impetus for the Doctor to do something he's never done before.Timothy Dalton appears as the Lord President of the Time Lords. I love what goes on in these episodes on Gallifrey. Part of the enduring charm of Doctor Who is some deliciously beautiful obscurity that prompts many a trolling forum war and questions arise provoking many interesting discussions that hopefully end without feelings hurt or people crying ""I'm leaving this forum"" as though it's some kind of suicide threat.The buildup in part 1 is basically fantastic. Doctor Who works a lot like the X-files in that it answers a lot of questions with answers that illicit even more questions. It's important to try and look at the whole series and in particular this mini series in this fashion.The humans have come up with a new piece of technology that is meant to keep a person forever young. Of course, being the Master, he quickly finds a way to pervert the genesis device(I'm going to call it that for now) and uses it to battle the wicked Madame Kovarian... I'm sorry, I'm confusing myself now. I'd actually rather not say what happens as it becomes a great plot twist and a joke that should leave you smiling. Even though I am not inclined to disclose certain events, I was impressed at the level of sheer imagination and the integration of clever and fun ideas. Even though the show gets rather whimsical at times, it never ever detracts from the story-telling and serves to make any perceptible plot holes seem completely unimportant. That is of course just me though.The end of time was a fantastic way for David Tennant to bow out of the series and much like Matt Smith's exit should have any genuine Doctor lover reaching for their fair share of tissues.",5,End of time.. for David Tennant (Sniff),1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,3049,"['Doctor', 'Who', 'especially', 'new', 'shows', 'have', 'culminated', 'seven', 'series', 'so', 'far', 'consist', 'blend', 'horror/sci-fi/comedy/drama', 'bit', 'fantasy', 'whimsy', 'thrown', 'turn', 'Given', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'universe', 'scope', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'are', 'bound', 'be', 'questions', 'resulting', 'potential', 'plot', 'holes', 'said', ""n't"", 'matter', 'story', 'so', 'well-written', 'clever', 'fun', 'executed', 'such', 'boundless', 'brilliance', 'energy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'same.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'before', 'John', 'Simm', 'Life', 'Mars', 'absolute', 'joy', 'watch', 'Master', 'was', 'brilliant', 'end', 'series', '3', 'cackling', 'howls', 'insanity', 'astronomical', 'levels', 'here', 'awesome', 'villain', 'easily', 'Daleks', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'terms', 'sheer', 'power', 'terms', 'charisma', 'how', 'lovably', 'is.You', 'might', 'remember', 'Bernard', 'Cribbins', 'one', 'Fawlty', 'Towers', 'episode', 'Hotel', 'Inspectors', 'first', 'saw', 'season', '3', 'episode', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'then', 'appeared', 'season', '4', 'supporting', 'character', 'very', 'sporadic', 'appearances', 'here', 'there', 'Donna', 'Noble', 'grandfather', 'two', 'part', 'special', 'though', 'very', 'important', 'role', 'emotional', 'support', 'doctor', 'impetus', 'Doctor', 'do', 'something', 'never', 'done', 'before.Timothy', 'Dalton', 'Lord', 'President', 'Time', 'Lords', 'love', 'what', 'episodes', 'Gallifrey', 'Part', 'enduring', 'charm', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'deliciously', 'beautiful', 'obscurity', 'many', 'trolling', 'forum', 'war', 'questions', 'arise', 'provoking', 'many', 'interesting', 'discussions', 'hopefully', 'end', 'feelings', 'hurt', 'people', 'crying', ""'m"", 'leaving', 'forum', 'kind', 'suicide', 'threat.The', 'buildup', 'part', '1', 'basically', 'fantastic', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'lot', 'X-files', 'lot', 'questions', 'answers', 'illicit', 'even', 'more', 'questions', 'important', 'try', 'look', 'whole', 'series', 'particular', 'mini', 'series', 'fashion.The', 'humans', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'piece', 'technology', 'meant', 'keep', 'person', 'forever', 'young', 'course', 'being', 'Master', 'quickly', 'way', 'pervert', 'genesis', 'device', ""'m"", 'going', 'call', 'now', 'battle', 'wicked', 'Madame', 'Kovarian', ""'m"", 'sorry', ""'m"", 'confusing', 'now', ""'d"", 'actually', 'rather', 'not', 'say', 'what', 'great', 'plot', 'twist', 'joke', 'should', 'leave', 'smiling', 'Even', 'am', 'not', 'inclined', 'disclose', 'certain', 'events', 'was', 'impressed', 'level', 'sheer', 'imagination', 'integration', 'clever', 'fun', 'ideas', 'Even', 'show', 'rather', 'whimsical', 'times', 'never', 'ever', 'story-telling', 'make', 'perceptible', 'plot', 'holes', 'seem', 'completely', 'unimportant', 'course', 'just', 'though.The', 'end', 'time', 'was', 'fantastic', 'way', 'David', 'Tennant', 'bow', 'series', 'much', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'exit', 'should', 'have', 'genuine', 'Doctor', 'lover', 'reaching', 'fair', 'share', 'tissues']",N/A

He wants to twist and change much of the original Dr. Who universe and he can't even stick with the plot lines that he has created. Are the time Lords gone or not? Is the Time War time locked or not? How can we keep resurrecting the Master when he was well past his regeneration cycle in the original series? How did Rassilon come back? I agree with other reviewers that RTD constantly sets up plot lines that don't work and then he resolves them in illogical or ""magical"" ways.Also, from what I am reading, the US fans are tired of RTD's personal agenda running through his shows. Are UK fans blind to this? Why does he have to work in over dramatic conversations of life and death in every episode he writes?The saving grace in this final episode is Bernard Cribbins. He is awsome and the only reason this deserves two stars. I really liked Tennant, but this final show is a mass of contradictions and not true to Dr. Who.

1314222,A3UKTEEU8TWNV7,B002ZHKZDS,B. Starbuck,"[39, 39]","Five stars because David Tennant, Bernard Cribbins and John Simm deserve it...I was worried after Part One. There seemed to be a lot of flailing loose ends, but... wow... Russell T. Davies really brought it together in Part Two. Whatever you want to say about Russell T. Davies, love him or hate him, you cannot deny that he leaves an impact, and ""The End of Time"" is no exception. As a life-long Whovian, I have to say, his writing for the Doctor is... monumental... and I know a lot of people don't like or appreciate the emotional vein in which he's written ~ even I have railed against it sometimes ~ but the guy knows how to tell a story, and he knows how to draw you in. He knows what strings to pull and which buttons to push, and that's the mark of a great storyteller. He flirted with returning the Time Lords, brought back their meanest, baddest one of all, and even introduced us, albeit fleetingly and mysteriously, to the Doctor's mother (or possibly Romana - I've heard arguments for both). By the end, he'd pretty much broken our favorite Time Lord, redeemed the Master, in a vague sort of way, and slapped the Time Lords back into the pits of the Time War.Now, to the performances. John Simm, as the Master, was much less of a crazy caricature like he was in The Sound Of Drums and Last Of the Time Lords, and more of a creepy-crazy. The devouring of food and pounding of the head and the almost inbred insanity was palpable and gave a sense that this man, while a genius and the Doctor's equal on many levels, was falling apart at the seams, and Simm's performance was spectacular. You can tell how much he enjoys playing the part, that's for sure! Bravo! And a thumbs-up should go to Timothy Dalton as Rassilon. His growling, menacing portrayal of the Lord President almost made the Master look like a ten-year old amateur.But the gems of these two episodes are the scenes between David Tennant and Bernard Cribbins. They are absolutely priceless. The dialogue and interaction between the two actors is so heartbreaking and subtle, and so well written. The dynamic between the Doctor and Wilf was simply perfection and really highlighted the range of both actors. It's just drama at its best, and we see a side of the Doctor that we're unfamiliar with: scared, uncertain, resigned, woeful, bitter even ~ a stark contrast to his happy-go-lucky nature ~ you name it, it's in there. His regeneration scene was a perfect metaphor for his wanting to hold on for as long as he could, but if he had to go, he was going to take everything with him.As for David Tennant? I don't know what to say, except that he's absolutely brilliant, and he is going to be missed... SO MUCH! I never thought anyone could surpass Tom Baker, but Tennant did ~ in glorious fashion! The final twenty minutes of Part Two are so powerful, so wrenching, so unbelievably striking, and he proved why he is the most popular and loved Doctor among fans. Maybe it was the writing, maybe it was Tennant, maybe it was the beautiful musical score, maybe it was the perfect storm of all those things... in any case, it was the perfect ending, for all involved, and I don't think we could have asked for a better departure for Tennant or for Davies, and I thank them for the years of enjoyment they've brought!But as Ood Sigma said:""This Song is ending, but the Story never ends...""Bring on Matt Smith and Steven Moffat!Long Live the Doctor!!!",5,"""I got worse...

The Master returns and fights the Doctor. Other stuff happens. The Doctor dies and regenerates. So basic, but it works and works well.It's hard to get into specifics without exposing many a spoiler, so I won't bother. Suffice to say it's the perfect embodiment of everything we've come to expect of the Davies-era and does a great job setting things up for what's to come under the auspices of Stephen Moffat.THE GOOD:The Master is far more layered and interesting than he's been at any point since Roger Delgado had the role. Also his fate in the story mirrors that which had been planned for the Master had Delgado not died.The chemistry between Wilf and the Doctor. I really wish Wilf had been along for the ride through all the specials this year. Might've been more interesting than what we ended up with.The identity of the Lord President of the Time Lords. Now THAT I didn't see coming!The conversation between Wilf and the Doctor about what it's like to regenerate.The final goodbyes with basically everyone the Doctor has met since the series relaunch.THE BAD:The horrible deus ex machina that settled the cliff-hanger at the end of part one. I really hate that about Davies' writing. He paints himself into a corner and then uses basically ""magic"" to get out of it.The ""have your cake and eat it, too"" thing with Donna where we're told remembering the Doctor will cause her brain to melt, and then when she remembers him... well, that's not quite the case.The overwhelming music that sometimes drowns out the dialogue (this is mostly a problem in part one).THE UNANSWERED:Why was Wilf so important to the timelines?Who was the mysterious Time Lady?

Beckstrom,"[1, 1]","Hopefully we'll see David Tennant back for the Who 50th anniversary; for nowso very sad to see him depart-the best doctor, surpassing even the iconic Tom Baker and the excellent Peter Davison.My enjoyment of this episode was bitter sweet given that it marks the end of an era. I even put off watching it for a month because I just didn't have the heart. Some of the frenzied action is familiar territory-the kind of thing we have seen many times before in Who. Still, the poignancy laced throughout is very compelling. The 10th doctor knows his days are literally numbered, and there are many moments when Tennant's Doctor, through Davies' mostly wonderful script, and really Tennant himself, are clearly in the process of saying goodbye. Davies continues his excellent re-imagining of The Doctor, building upon and extending both the tragic and heroic dimensions of the character. To me, the acting and the character development have become more important than the action during the past couple of seasons, especially since we've really known for almost 2 years that Tennant's Doctor would not be as long-lived as most fans would have liked. Giving nothing away, but let me just say that if you are a Who fan, a Tennant fan, the ending will break your heart but also satisfy. It is a most excellent and fond farewell.Also: Who fans MUST watch the extras on the Part 1 and 2 DVDs, which are GREAT. HOWEVER, rent both at the same time and watch the complete two-part episode before any of the extras, or you'll ruin the episode. Also, I suggest you watch the Who Confidential on both discs before watching David's video diary. In it, he takes the viewer through various moments during the production that we saw in Who Confidential, but from his perspective. It was Tennant's decision to depart the series, but he clearly had mixed feelings, and it's very moving to see him tear up on more than one occasion during the final days of production.4.5 stars for the episode, 5 stars for the extras.",5,"Bitter sweet, but excellent",1275264000,"05 31, 2010",2010,1993,"['Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'David', 'Tennant', 'back', 'Who', '50th', 'anniversary', 'nowso', 'very', 'sad', 'see', 'depart-the', 'best', 'doctor', 'surpassing', 'even', 'iconic', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'excellent', 'Peter', 'Davison.My', 'enjoyment', 'episode', 'was', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'given', 'end', 'era', 'even', 'put', 'off', 'watching', 'month', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'heart', 'frenzied', 'action', 'familiar', 'territory-the', 'kind', 'thing', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Who', 'Still', 'poignancy', 'laced', 'very', 'compelling', '10th', 'doctor', 'days', 'are', 'literally', 'numbered', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'when', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'Davies', 'mostly', 'wonderful', 'script', 'really', 'Tennant', 'are', 'clearly', 'process', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'Davies', 'excellent', 're-imagining', 'Doctor', 'building', 'upon', 'extending', 'tragic', 'heroic', 'dimensions', 'character', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'important', 'action', 'past', 'couple', 'seasons', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'really', 'known', 'almost', '2', 'years', 'Tennant', 'Doctor', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'long-lived', 'most', 'fans', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'Giving', 'nothing', 'away', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'are', 'Who', 'fan', 'Tennant', 'fan', 'ending', 'will', 'break', 'heart', 'also', 'satisfy', 'most', 'excellent', 'fond', 'farewell.Also', 'Who', 'MUST', 'watch', 'extras', 'Part', '1', '2', 'DVDs', 'are', 'GREAT', 'HOWEVER', 'rent', 'same', 'time', 'watch', 'complete', 'two-part', 'episode', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'ruin', 'episode', 'Also', 'suggest', 'watch', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'discs', 'watching', 'David', 'video', 'diary', 'viewer', 'various', 'moments', 'production', 'saw', 'Who', 'Confidential', 'perspective', 'was', 'Tennant', 'decision', 'depart', 'series', 'clearly', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'very', 'moving', 'see', 'tear', 'up', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'final', 'days', 'production.4.5', 'stars', 'episode', '5', 'stars', 'extras']",N/A
1314225,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002ZHKZDS,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","Ah, once again to arrive late in the game and review/critique at leisure. This is not one of my favorite episodes from David Tennant's tenure as the Doctor. (The third ""series""--read ""season""--was by far the best.)A large part of this story in actuality revolves around the return of Master, who is frankly nothing more than disgusting and puerile. He's also a big, fat baby and nobody likes that--except the Doctor, perhaps. (He did weep at the previous death of the Master.)In this film, the Master is of course something of a silly shadow of his true self, and in a sense is like an incarnate ghost rather than a reincarnation: he's a tangible and revolting, unstable energy-bundle. Not a ghost, not reincarnated. More like Lord Voldemort.The drumming in his head, present since his childhood, is still there. It turns out this is a signal from the Time Lords, in a ""time bubble"" exile since the Time Lord War. What angered me, if I may interject here, is the lack of any expose of that war, which would have been a blast-and-a-half with Tennant at the helm...but we'll probably never know.I liked the female Time Lord (jeez, she's a Lady, did no one catch that??)--the Doctor's mother, which old what's-a-name the producer/writer confirmed in an interview. She appeared before this, as a spectre-like figure, sighing in despair and issuing warnings. Also, I believe that at the end these Time Lords were turned into the Weeping Angels and sent back to the beginning of time.Timothy Dalton!! What can I say? I'm a fan from his young days, and here he SHINES. He's the best Time Lord I've ever seen, and I'm of the old school that acknowledges only Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker and David Tennant. However, Dalton gave everyone some acting lessons here. His powerful yet calm voice, his sinister, bossy aristocratic sneer...oh, perfecto!!

1314229,ASROVJ5DQ3TER,B002ZHKZDS,J. Bosch,"[3, 3]","After reading the negative reviews--and even some of the criticisms in the positive reviews--I was hesitant to buy this DVD. But I really wanted to see how Tennant  and RTD would wrap up this era, so I took the plunge.I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the story. Was it sometimes over the top? Sure! Does the story have some glaring plot holes and inconsistencies? You bet. But what Doctor Who story doesn't? Heck, even many of the works of ""great literature"" don't stand up 100% to close scrutiny, so I won't let that bother me. If you follow the dialog closely, nearly all questions are answered, which is pretty hard to do when writing a script and then putting a final edit together that may or may not include all the elements of the original story.So, instead of filling in a scorecard of plusses and minuses, I'm just rating this story on how much it entertained me, and on that score it has to get at least four stars. Here are a few things that stood out to me: Tennant, Cribbins and Simm each deserve kudos for their performance, and Dalton added some theatrical power to the lot. Matt Smith's moment as the new Doctor showed a LOT of promise for the future of the show. The music was mixed too loud in the first story, then was toned down in the second. I like Murray Gold's scores, so no complaints there, as both the music and the effects contributed to the story instead of distracting me from it (except for a few times in the first episode when the music nearly drowned out the dialog, that is). In many ways The End of Time reminds me of The Caves of Androzani, but I won't bore anyone with a ""compare and contrast"" of the two.I think the majority of Who fans will like this two-parter, and I think it will stand up to repeat viewing.",4,Better than expected,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,1788,"['reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'even', 'criticisms', 'positive', 'reviews', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'DVD', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'Tennant', 'RTD', 'would', 'wrap', 'up', 'era', 'took', 'plunge.I', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'Was', 'sometimes', 'top', 'Sure', 'story', 'have', 'glaring', 'plot', 'holes', 'inconsistencies', 'bet', 'what', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'story', ""n't"", 'Heck', 'even', 'many', 'works', 'great', 'literature', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', '100', '%', 'close', 'scrutiny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'bother', 'follow', 'dialog', 'closely', 'nearly', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'pretty', 'hard', 'do', 'when', 'writing', 'script', 'then', 'putting', 'final', 'edit', 'together', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'include', 'elements', 'original', 'story.So', 'instead', 'filling', 'scorecard', 'plusses', 'minuses', ""'m"", 'just', 'rating', 'story', 'how', 'much', 'entertained', 'score', 'get', 'least', 'four', 'stars', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'stood', 'out', 'Tennant', 'Cribbins', 'Simm', 'deserve', 'kudos', 'performance', 'Dalton', 'added', 'theatrical', 'power', 'lot', 'Matt', 'Smith', 'moment', 'new', 'Doctor', 'showed', 'LOT', 'promise', 'future', 'show', 'music', 'was', 'mixed', 'too', 'loud', 'first', 'story', 'then', 'was', 'toned', 'down', 'second', 'Murray', 'Gold', 'scores', 'complaints', 'there', 'music', 'effects', 'contributed', 'story', 'instead', 'distracting', 'few', 'times', 'first', 'episode', 'when', 'music', 'nearly', 'drowned', 'out', 'dialog', 'many', 'ways', 'End', 'Time', 'Caves', 'Androzani', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'anyone', 'compare', 'contrast', 'two.I', 'think', 'majority', 'Who', 'fans', 'will', 'like', 'two-parter', 'think', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'repeat', 'viewing']",N/A

Part two gets a lot better, but it doesn't make much sense. If the Time Lords were the reason the Doctor ended the Time War then why does he act like it was the Daleks' fault in previous episodes such as ""Dalek""? How is Rassilon back? And who is the mysterious woman who keeps appearing throughout the story? These unanswered questions are only part of the reason I don't much care for this story. I also think the Doctor's regeneration was crap too. The effect was great, but the way they did it with the Doctor saying ""I don't want to go"" was crap.

1314233,A1LPTWPNBPZWJP,B002ZHKZDS,Kaan Vural,"[5, 15]","Some disclaimers before I begin, so as not to immediately alienate fans of this story, Russell T. Davies, David Tennant, and the New Series in general.I don't hate this story because of Russell T. Davies. In my mind, Series 1 was one of the finest pieces of television for a long, long time; and stories like Midnight and The End of the World show his merit as a writer. That said, I do hold him responsible for this episode because he's the writer and showrunner, but I'll get into specifically WHY I blame him a bit later.I don't hate this story because of David Tennant or the Tenth Doctor. Tennant is a fine actor - for me, in terms of caliber, he's around the upper middle of actors to have played the Doctor. The character he played wasn't really my type - I prefer the less human, more subdued incarnations - but in a good story (Silence in the Library/The Forest of the Dead and Midnight come to mind), he's quite brilliant. The way his character is handled here, though, is a big problem I have with the episode - but again, specifics later.Finally, I don't hate this story because I hate the New Series. I don't hate the New Series. I grew up watching reruns of the Classic Series, and New Series began when I was about fifteen. So I'm in no position to be the crotchety old guy here. Sure, there are things about the format I wish I could change, but these are just my subjective problems with how television works today (episode lengths, season arcs). For the (in my eyes subjective) limitations they had, Davies did a very good job; and honestly, there were many updates to the Classic format that I found very welcome (such as a greater engagement with human drama and more unconventional storytelling).So please understand that, when I rank this in my bottom three of every Doctor Who episode ever made (and yes, I've watched every one) - basically a three-way tie with A Good Man Goes to War and Utopia - I'm doing it not for reasons of superficial hate, but because...well, OK, let's get into it.Spoilers below, by the way.My absolute biggest problem with this episode, a problem that just demolishes it from the get-go, is the Tenth Doctor himself. Firstly, he's written as a selfish jerk. When he emerges from the TARDIS after a long holiday, he mentions that he got married to Queen Elizabeth I and abandoned her. Um. What? Now I get that we have no context on this - for all we know it was life-or-death - but look at how much hatred that woman has for him! Something traumatized her - and he's making it into a joke. Whatever, it was just something he said in passing. But then, when he confesses to Wilfred that he's going to die and Wilfred says, ""So am I,"" the Doctor glares at him and says, ""Don't you start."" WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ""DON'T YOU START""? The guy has had the lifespan of an ant compared to you, and you're complaining that, what, you didn't lead a full life or something? Most unforgivable for me is the ending, where he spends something like half a minute shouting about how important he is compared to Wilfred before sacrificing his life. Now call me a purist, but whenever the Doctor offered his life in place of someone else's he did it unquestioningly, with perhaps a statement of fear - but NEVER, and I repeat NEVER, did he consider himself above the people he was risking his neck for. That was just how good of a man he was. When the Fifth Doctor has to choose between himself and Peri, there's no contest. When the Fourth Doctor realizes he could risk his life to get information about the Wirrn, there's no discussion. This was always true about the Doctor to a fault - in Genesis of the Daleks, the only reason he breaks down under Davros's interrogation is because his friends are threatened. He was fully prepared to die for his friends in that scene, and it just made him that much more amazing and magical a character.By contrast, when the Tenth Doctor gets into the chamber, it doesn't feel heroic, and it doesn't make his character seem good or outstanding. He's just a jerk who's doing it because some higher power (*cough* the BBC *cough*) says he has to. Look at his face. There's no courage, there's no acceptance, there's no glimmer of heroism. He's just sick and tired. And his final words? ""I don't wanna go."" Pointless. Utterly pointless.And for those of you who felt that this was a necessary ending because of the character of his Doctor, well, I'm sorry, but when the Doctor's life is on the line it's got to bring out the best in him. Day after day, year after year, this man puts himself and his friends in danger to help people he barely knows, because it's the right thing to do. That kind of bravery is just utterly incompatible with this kind of cowardice.Secondly, the moral dilemma his character is put in is...well, it's not really a moral dilemma, is it? At the climax of the story, he has two choices: kill the Master or kill Rassilon. Which one should he pick? Answer: WHO CARES? They're both evil Time Lords, and killing either one is going to be about equivalent in usefulness. So all we're left with is the possibility that the Doctor is going to kill someone - oh, no, he just gets to shoot a machine and reverse everything. Yeah, way to make your character take a stand, Russell. Pointless. Utterly pointless.You see, I think that for all his strengths as a writer and storyteller, Davies ultimately succumbed - in what should have been his finest hour - to crass sentimentalism. When you're an artist of any stripe, by all means create what you want, but for the love of God stay faithful to your vision. I think Davies forgot he was writing the Doctor - a fictional character - and instead wrote him as a fan phenomenon who was on the verge of retirement or something. The Doctor says that regeneration ""feels like dying...some other man gets up and walks away"". Well, I'm sorry, but that contradicts EVERYTHING we know about regeneration. The different incarnations of the Doctor are NOT DIFFERENT PEOPLE. They are the SAME MAN, just biologically a bit reshuffled. How can it feel like dying...when you don't DIE? Answer: because thousands of fans can't get out of their heads the idea that David Tennant is leaving the role. Guys, your loyalty should be to the CHARACTER, not to the guy who's playing him.This infects other aspects of the story as well. The episode is full of little devices and contrivances built in to make the story seem more ""epic"", but are just so forced. The mysterious Woman, who serves no purpose in the story beyond saying cryptic things without meaning. Rassilon's narration, which if you think about it makes absolutely no sense. The Ood civilization accelerating too quickly - which never amounts to anything. People having bad dreams, which is never explained.  The will of the Force or something drawing Wilfred and the Doctor together - which is really just an excuse for thin writing, the equivalent of Anakin and Padme falling in love in the Star Wars prequels. None of these devices were necessary to make this story feel ""epic"" - a truly epic story should speak for itself. The fact that they were stuck in there is just outright proof that there was some subconscious lack of confidence in this story.Another annoyance was bringing back the Master, who in case no one remembers COMMITTED SUICIDE AT THE END OF HIS LAST STORY - A STORY WRITTEN BY DAVIES, I MIGHT ADD. This totally negates the emotional power of the Master's death - which had three episodes dedicated to it, if you'll recall. I was shocked that Davies, who is usually so conscious of these things, would succumb to such an obvious comic book ploy in bringing back the character - and outraged that he's basically brought back through Harry Potter techniques. You think I'm kidding? The lover's lipstick, the ring from his hand, the life of his servants? What the ungodly heavens is this stuff doing in a SCIENCE fantasy show? Less insulting was the return of the Time Lords - but the explanation given is so nonsensical - from the use of time travel (with the white-point star) to escape a Time Lock (which raises the question of why the Time Lords just didn't do this themselves), to the use of ""triangulation"" to pinpoint a signal's source (sorry kids, but there's no way triangulation works over those kinds of distances - and if it was a signal being transmitted, why did no-one pick it up and realize it was artificial? Why, especially, did the Master not realize this after goodness knows how many centuries?)I'm sorry if this comes off as nit-picking to you, but I just felt really insulted by all this stuff. In my eyes, Russell needed to bring his top A-game to an episode this important - and that requires knowing your limitations (in Russell's case, solid plotting and not letting finales get out of hand) and compensating for them. This just feels like a George Lucas-like explosion of self-indulgence a la the prequel trilogy - except for the fact that Davies is a good writer, which makes this failure all the more disappointing.There's any number of other things I could talk about, but these are the most important problems for me. Just to reiterate: this is not a review of David Tennant, or Russell T. Davies, or the New Series. It's a review of the episode.

Davies episode and watch how he gets them out of impossible situations. Yes, there's a name for it. And ALL writers know that this is the worst offense you can commit in fiction. I'm STUNNED that he has done it so long and so consistently. Between that and the gay agenda that adds nothing to the story whatever your views on the subject (this is a kids show, after all), this episode is a perfect example of why I am SO glad that the RTD era is finally coming to an end.This episode has some truly fantastic moments, and Bernard Cribbins is utterly brilliant. That being said, there is far more that is simply over the top and embarrassingly contrived. It's a shame too, because there could have been a truly brilliant episode in there somewhere; the origin of the ""drums"" was really quite clever. But do we really need green cactus people? Or John Simm in drag? Really?? It's all just so over the top. Subtlety and restraint can be much more powerful than BIGness. After Waters of Mars, which was refreshingly excellent, this was a HUGE disappointment.There were some bright spots, of course. John Simm is one of the greatest actors in the entire universe ever. His Master was complex and sympathetic, and just like in the original series, you liked him. And I can't say enough about Bernard Cribbins. He is utterly amazing. I think Tennant already had his eyes on Hamlet by this time, because I didn't feel like his heart was in it. Still, I adore him and his doctor, and will remember him fondly.Our brief taste of Matt Smith at the end is perhaps the brightest spot. You just feel that better days are ahead. And ""I'm a girl"" is one of my favorite lines from any Dr. Who!Fans of the original series will be left trying to work out a few things (you know what they are). And a long-standing puzzle from Torchwood is finally answered too, if you're paying attention.But all of the good stuff, and there is plenty, is just spoiled by all the bad stuff. I have no interest in watching this episode again.But good news!! The days of farting aliens and little marshmallow babies made of fat are OVER!

That is how I see it done in the USA in my opinion here in my head with the drumming.That is why I cant give the whole affair anything less than 5 stars.The whole meal was well prepared but served after the wait staff had let it sit under the lamps a little too long perhaps.The service1. Donna was a useless plot thread-underused her remembering should have been able to knock down the clones in a greater range than just her general vicinity.2. The cacti? really? just to provide a ship with guns and a place to chat?3. Timothy Dalton-does he really spit that much when he talks? Is there some sort of UK fetish with spiting, there was a lot of it going on in the story, and having Nazi guards in damn near everything- not that it ain't damn funny, 'cause that marching thing, as with the Russians in other films and television is hilarious. Ok, I don't think we had any silly marching in here, but it is a way to make my point.4. No valid reason for another silly point at this time-maybe after I watch my copy of this set when it comesThe meal1. Totally nuts John Simm again, this is the Master at his best- Roger and Anthony were very refined in their performances- a bit Shakespearean, Conan Doyle, more Moriarty. Simm's Master is off the deep end gone to the funny farm,... .2.Timothy Dalton- nutty as a fruit cake- the eventual state of all Timelords when they know death is the only thing left after this last regeneration. Lets go out with a bang not a whimper is the best way to express it.3. Not sure where to put this-the Ovglove-is this the same glove that the Torchwood team had found, well one of the pair?4. Wilf- a great character, enough said,the performance speaks for itself.5. Timelords victorious- and led by a nutter-perfect6. The whole time war on the edge of and the crashed Dalek ships on Gallifrey and the Doctor possessing the moment and the whole ball of cheese- my son did not quite get it, but then if you have been watching Doctor Who since the very-1963 beginning you do. The Doctor knew the Timelords had absolute power,and that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"".see Wikipedia-Lord Acton's dictum for exact context of that quote just for fun and extra credit7. Seven being a lucky number will be my final point. For me the meal is not complete without dessert. Russel T serves up a really tasty surprise- the Doctor and the Master can work together, Wilf gets the Doctor toasted with radiation in the end, it was him that would knock 4 times. My son noticed that but I missed it-I will have to confirm of course-our children should succeed in life and status etc beyond our own state, but they must never know more than we do!Finally, the Doctor takes some time/space dramatic license and gets a few shots in before giving into death's fateful grip(for a Timelord, not an ultimate one hopefully if everything goes ok with that regeneration)-Not in order and maybe missing one or two stops; he goes to a very plagiarist Star Wars Cantina to set up a blind date for an old friend and maybe help restart another series, saves some old friends who are together (how?) fighting an old enemy who has a hilarious Achilles heel,goes to a wedding giving the Bridegroom a very naughty little gift, goes to a book signing (almost forgot that one), and then says goodbye to a beloved friend before even having met them(clever).Top that all off with the ""oh no I don't want to go"" temper tantrum, and that was a tasty meal.My compliments to the Chef.",5,"5 stars for the tasty treats.- 2 stars for service, but all around a good meal",1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,3682,"['When', 'go', 'dining', 'leave', 'tip', 'generally', 'based', 'quality', 'service', 'wait', 'staff', 'meal', 'not', 'just', 'quality', 'food', 'sometimes', 'whole', 'thing', 'great', 'Chef', 'really', 'how', 'see', 'done', 'USA', 'opinion', 'here', 'head', 'drumming.That', 'why', 'cant', 'give', 'whole', 'affair', 'anything', 'less', '5', 'stars.The', 'whole', 'meal', 'was', 'well', 'prepared', 'served', 'wait', 'staff', 'had', 'let', 'sit', 'lamps', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'perhaps.The', 'service1', 'Donna', 'was', 'useless', 'plot', 'thread-underused', 'remembering', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'knock', 'down', 'clones', 'greater', 'range', 'just', 'general', 'vicinity.2', 'cacti', 'really', 'just', 'provide', 'ship', 'guns', 'place', 'chat', '3', 'Timothy', 'Dalton-does', 'really', 'spit', 'much', 'when', 'talks', 'Is', 'there', 'sort', 'UK', 'fetish', 'spiting', 'was', 'lot', 'going', 'story', 'having', 'Nazi', 'guards', 'damn', 'everything-', 'not', 'ai', ""n't"", 'damn', 'funny', 'marching', 'thing', 'Russians', 'other', 'films', 'television', 'hilarious', 'Ok', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'had', 'silly', 'marching', 'here', 'way', 'make', 'point.4', 'valid', 'reason', 'silly', 'point', 'time-maybe', 'watch', 'copy', 'set', 'when', 'comesThe', 'meal1', 'Totally', 'nuts', 'John', 'Simm', 'again', 'Master', 'best-', 'Roger', 'Anthony', 'were', 'very', 'refined', 'performances-', 'bit', 'Shakespearean', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'more', 'Moriarty', 'Simm', 'Master', 'deep', 'end', 'gone', 'funny', 'farm', '.2.Timothy', 'Dalton-', 'nutty', 'fruit', 'cake-', 'eventual', 'state', 'Timelords', 'when', 'know', 'death', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'last', 'regeneration', 'Lets', 'go', 'out', 'bang', 'not', 'whimper', 'best', 'way', 'express', 'it.3', 'Not', 'sure', 'where', 'put', 'this-the', 'Ovglove-is', 'same', 'glove', 'Torchwood', 'team', 'had', 'found', 'well', 'one', 'pair', '4', 'Wilf-', 'great', 'character', 'enough', 'said', 'performance', 'speaks', 'itself.5', 'victorious-', 'led', 'nutter-perfect6', 'whole', 'time', 'war', 'edge', 'crashed', 'Dalek', 'ships', 'Gallifrey', 'Doctor', 'possessing', 'moment', 'whole', 'ball', 'cheese-', 'son', 'did', 'not', 'quite', 'get', 'then', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'very-1963', 'beginning', 'do', 'Doctor', 'knew', 'Timelords', 'had', 'absolute', 'power', 'absolute', 'power', 'corrupts', 'absolutely', '.see', 'Wikipedia-Lord', 'Acton', 'dictum', 'exact', 'context', 'quote', 'just', 'fun', 'extra', 'credit7', 'Seven', 'being', 'lucky', 'number', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'point', 'meal', 'not', 'complete', 'dessert', 'Russel', 'T', 'up', 'really', 'tasty', 'surprise-', 'Doctor', 'Master', 'can', 'work', 'together', 'Wilf', 'Doctor', 'toasted', 'radiation', 'end', 'was', 'would', 'knock', '4', 'times', 'son', 'noticed', 'missed', 'it-I', 'will', 'have', 'confirm', 'course-our', 'children', 'should', 'succeed', 'life', 'status', 'etc', 'own', 'state', 'must', 'never', 'know', 'more', 'do', 'Finally', 'Doctor', 'time/space', 'dramatic', 'license', 'few', 'shots', 'giving', 'death', 'fateful', 'grip', 'Timelord', 'not', 'ultimate', 'one', 'hopefully', 'everything', 'ok', 'regeneration', '-Not', 'order', 'maybe', 'missing', 'one', 'two', 'stops', 'very', 'plagiarist', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Cantina', 'set', 'up', 'blind', 'date', 'old', 'friend', 'maybe', 'help', 'restart', 'series', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'together', 'how', 'fighting', 'old', 'enemy', 'who', 'hilarious', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'wedding', 'giving', 'Bridegroom', 'very', 'naughty', 'little', 'gift', 'book', 'signing', 'almost', 'forgot', 'one', 'then', 'goodbye', 'beloved', 'friend', 'even', 'having', 'met', 'clever', 'oh', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'was', 'tasty', 'meal.My', 'compliments', 'Chef']",N/A
