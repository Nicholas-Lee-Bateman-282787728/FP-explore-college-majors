904795,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0009FU0ZQ,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[13, 13]","Based on a Robert B. Parker novel, ""Stone Cold"" is a made-for-TV film that is an excellent vehicle for Tom Selleck's talent. He plays Police Chief Jesse Stone, who lives in a small Massachusetts town, having left behind a broken marriage and a heavy drinking habit in Los Angeles. Both however are still in his life, as his wife continues to call, and his solace is in the bottle. Though the plot is about a series of killings, as well as the rape of a teenage girl, there is little that makes this film a ""thriller,"" as the leisurely pace and stoic demeanor of Stone dominate the story. He is intelligent and witty, and Selleck is perfect in the role. Selleck describes the film as being ""...almost totally based on emotion, told through the eyes of a character who doesn't like to show any.""Others in the cast include Mimi Rogers, terrific as a seductive attorney, and Stephen McHattie as Captain Healy. Directed with a steady hand by Robert Harmon, it boasts a superb score by Jeff Beals, and some lovely cinematography by Rene Ohashi. Total running time is 87 minutes. DVD extras include ""Beneath the Surface of ""Stone Cold"" Featurette,"" with interviews of Selleck, Harmon and Rogers. Selleck speaks of plans for more of Jesse Stone in the future, which is a tremendous idea, as this film is excellent material for a series. The character of Stone is tough and complex, and immensely likeable as played by Selleck, who has come a long way since being the TV hunk of the 80's, and is a superb actor.",4,A Quiet Character Study,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,1502,"['Based', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'novel', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'made-for-TV', 'film', 'excellent', 'vehicle', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'talent', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'who', 'small', 'Massachusetts', 'town', 'having', 'left', 'broken', 'marriage', 'heavy', 'drinking', 'habit', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'however', 'are', 'still', 'life', 'wife', 'call', 'solace', 'bottle', 'plot', 'series', 'killings', 'as', 'well', 'rape', 'teenage', 'girl', 'little', 'film', 'thriller', 'leisurely', 'pace', 'stoic', 'demeanor', 'Stone', 'dominate', 'story', 'intelligent', 'witty', 'Selleck', 'perfect', 'role', 'Selleck', 'film', 'being', 'almost', 'totally', 'based', 'emotion', 'told', 'eyes', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'Others', 'cast', 'include', 'Mimi', 'Rogers', 'terrific', 'seductive', 'attorney', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'Captain', 'Healy', 'Directed', 'steady', 'hand', 'Robert', 'Harmon', 'superb', 'score', 'Jeff', 'Beals', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'Rene', 'Ohashi', 'Total', 'running', 'time', '87', 'minutes', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'Surface', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Featurette', 'interviews', 'Selleck', 'Harmon', 'Rogers', 'Selleck', 'speaks', 'plans', 'more', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'future', 'tremendous', 'idea', 'film', 'excellent', 'material', 'series', 'character', 'Stone', 'tough', 'complex', 'immensely', 'likeable', 'played', 'Selleck', 'who', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'being', 'TV', 'hunk', '80', 'superb', 'actor']",N/A

Boy was I wrong! This mystery kept me up on the edge of my seat and had me wondering how it would be solved.My one quibble is they revealed the antagonists a bit too early. Despite this, I understand it was necessary to move the plot along and it worked fairly well. Although I was hoping for other suspects so the protagonists could interview other ""persons of interest."" However, that would have necessitated dropping the subplot whioch was simply too integral to the story to discard. I liked how the story came together. Even the minor characters worked well.

904802,A1AP3A4UW8OJFV,B0009FU0ZQ,Andre 2015,"[3, 3]","Robert B.Parker is one of the best - if not the best - in telling a story almost entirely through dialogue and as such perfect for film.His novels are million sellers, and they deserve to be.Parker's output is amazing. The Spenser series, the Jesse Stone and the Sunny Randal novels, a couple of westerns and YA novels, the list goes on and on.Stone Cold is a TV movie based on the 4th novel in the Jesse Stone series. And it's terrific. Parker has never ever before been transmitted to film like this.Though Jesse in the novels is a little younger than Tom Selleck, Tom is perfect in the role. He's witty, tough, straight, comes equipped with a huge heart, and is ready for action when he needs to be.Not that you would expect that in Paradise, Massachusetts, the quiet little New England fishing town where Jesse just started as the new police chief. As a former L.A. homicide detective who left behind the big city and his divorced wife, Jesse probably didn't expect a serial killer couple to disrupt the peace. As the killers try to destroy Jesse's private life just as a gang rape case stretches thin his small town police force, Jesse decides it's time to hit back.Tom Selleck in my opinion has never been better. And he knows it. No wonder he is one of the executive producers on the series.But this is not just about Tom. Polly Shannon is lovely as his girlfriend (or pal, as Jesse prefers to call her), Viola Davis and Kohl Sudduth shine as small town cops, the dog too - as the dog (what would a Parker tale be without one)Robert Harmon's directing is state of the art, as are Jeff Beal's music, Rene Ohashi's camera work and the location and production design.If you keep in mind that this is just a TV production it is amazing what the team pulled off with a relatively small budget.

904805,ANY46RC9MF6DB,B0009FU0ZQ,"Anne ""Mystery Fan""","[2, 3]","""Stone Cold"" starring Tom Selleck, was, I believe, the first of a series of TV movies based on Robert Parker's books. It's an excellent story, well-acted, filled with wonderful characters and relationships.  The film is over too soon, and I can appreciate people's desire to see more of this series, but I didn't think the other movies were as well done.In this story a serial killer (or killers) is loose in the small town where Selleck works as a sheriff.  We learn early on who the killer(s) are and the movie is a game of cat and mouse with Selleck trying to outsmart and eventually capture them.  Jane Adams gives a riveting performance as a sociopathic killer and Selleck is ideally cast as the sheriff.Alexis Dziena is a sympathetic rape victim.  Her interfering mother prevents Selleck from dealing with the rapists in the way he'd like, and he makes the best of a bad situation, but I don't think a lot of the issues of rape were dealt with realistically.Alexis worries about having to go back to school with the boys who raped her, and worries about how she'll be treated by friends and schoolmates who know what happened, but no one even touches on how she'll feel about herself after this, or about boys, or how she'll feel about marriage and having children.  Rape is not a social faux pas that you have to live down at school; it's a life-changing event that alters the way you feel about yourself and your world and the people in it, including people you once thought you could trust.I hate to criticize something so important in a movie I like so much, but while the writers seemed to like the young character, they didn't fully understand her situation.  And maybe the actress playing the role was too young to know or to speak out about the fact that her part was drawn incompletely.  A more mature Jane Adams (or perhaps her director) fleshed out her character beautifully.Even with flaws, it's still a wonderful movie.  In fact, the flaws wouldn't be noticeable if it weren't such a terrific movie.",4,Superior Selleck Movie,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",2010,2018,"['Stone', 'Cold', 'starring', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'was', 'believe', 'first', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'based', 'Robert', 'Parker', 'books', 'excellent', 'story', 'well-acted', 'filled', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'relationships', 'film', 'too', 'soon', 'can', 'appreciate', 'people', 'desire', 'see', 'more', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'other', 'movies', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'serial', 'killer', 'killers', 'loose', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'Selleck', 'sheriff', 'learn', 'early', 'who', 'killer', 's', 'are', 'movie', 'game', 'cat', 'mouse', 'Selleck', 'trying', 'outsmart', 'eventually', 'capture', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'riveting', 'performance', 'sociopathic', 'killer', 'Selleck', 'ideally', 'cast', 'sheriff.Alexis', 'Dziena', 'sympathetic', 'rape', 'victim', 'interfering', 'mother', 'prevents', 'Selleck', 'dealing', 'rapists', 'way', ""'d"", 'like', 'best', 'bad', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'lot', 'issues', 'rape', 'were', 'dealt', 'realistically.Alexis', 'worries', 'having', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'boys', 'who', 'raped', 'worries', 'how', ""'ll"", 'be', 'treated', 'friends', 'schoolmates', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'one', 'even', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'boys', 'how', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'marriage', 'having', 'children', 'Rape', 'not', 'social', 'faux', 'pas', 'have', 'live', 'down', 'school', 'life-changing', 'event', 'way', 'feel', 'world', 'people', 'including', 'people', 'once', 'thought', 'could', 'trust.I', 'hate', 'criticize', 'something', 'so', 'important', 'movie', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'writers', 'seemed', 'young', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'fully', 'understand', 'situation', 'maybe', 'actress', 'playing', 'role', 'was', 'too', 'young', 'know', 'speak', 'out', 'fact', 'part', 'was', 'drawn', 'incompletely', 'more', 'mature', 'Jane', 'Adams', 'perhaps', 'director', 'fleshed', 'out', 'character', 'beautifully.Even', 'flaws', 'still', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'fact', 'flaws', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'noticeable', 'were', ""n't"", 'such', 'terrific', 'movie']",N/A

The production quality has been very high, the filming locations, in Nova Scotia, standing in for Maine, very scenic and atmospheric, the way in which the pulp genre characters and B-List former stars and character actors have been used has been keenly attuned to the needs of both Robert Parker's style and Tom Selleck's long established screen persona, the scripts have been lean and well crafted, and Tom Selleck has been wonderful, perfect, perhaps, as Jesse Stone. The first two instalments, with Viola Davis, were especially good. The score is wonderful -- is there any way to get that great music on CD?However, since the exit of actress Viola Davis as Jesse's fellow cop, police station manager and conscience, and the arrival of the very different Kathy Baker, in a similar role, the series has taken a definite turn into late middle aged ""Murder She Wrote"" torpor. The edginess that made it alluring has waned, the supporting actors have become less notable, and the recurring business about Jesse's drinking, his shrink, his dog, his indifference to being fired from his ""last chance"" job as chief of police, and the calls from his ex-wife have all become a little more rote, and lifeless.That said, there are some wonderful pulp genre elements here, and I guess I will keep watching. But they need to take stock and amp it back up a bit. It may be aimed at an older demographic, and that may even include me.

As I said, I was pleasantly surprised.This movie was smart, and Selleck was the perfect man for the role. The main plot is interesting and the smaller side plots really help the movie and help flesh out the personality of Sellecks character (Jesse Stone). The personal demons of Jesse Stone are nicely weaved into the plot and do not in any way diminish the movie, they actually help it.I gave it 5 stars not because it is going down in history as one of the greatest movies ever, but because it was very entertaining and did not have alot of the typical hollywood political correctness garbage.

This story of a New England sheriff, Chief Jesse Stone, trying to catch a cold calculating serial killer is well crafted. As if that wasn't enough he must catch those responsible for raping a girl. The book is a great read, and the movie does a fine job of following the key premises in the book. The directing by Robert Harmon is superb. I think his previous work as a camera man has given him a wonderful insight in helping the audience see and feel not only the characters clearly, but the surroundings as well.Along with the great job on the main case/story, the other cases/subplots were masterfully done giving a real feel of being there. This is one of the best TV movies I have seen in years. I applaud CBS for backing it. If you are an avid detective reader you should enjoy the book. Fans of detective movies or Tom Selleck should find this one well to their liking. I am happy to say the DVD is excellent. The picture and sound are incredibly sharp.

904834,AUHG8KSHI529U,B0009FU0ZQ,Craig Matteson,"[6, 9]","This movie was made for TV, but still got on R rating on DVD.  This is probably because of the marijuana smoking the bad high school athlete does in the boys bathroom at one point.  Otherwise, even the violence doesn't have that Hollywood graphic detail.  The characters in this film display the sexual mores of, well, they don't.Tom Selleck is very good as Jesse Stone, the run down big city cop who brings his problems to be the chief of police in a small town where the duties are small and his foibles can be indulged without hurting anyone.  His best friend is Abby Taylor (Polly Shannon) and she is one of the best things in the movie.The movie opens with one of the town's few policemen finding a murdered corpse and a live dog.  As the movie progresses there are more murders and it becomes clear that these are the work of a serial killer.  Another plot involves a young schoolgirl who is raped whose mother wants the perpetrators punished, but everything kept confidential because of the shame her family would suffer in such a small town.  The girl caught between her family, the boys who did this to her, and just trying to survive her teenage years.  Jesse does his best to help her as does another policewoman, Molly Crane (Viola Davis).It is a decent movie, but just moves so slowly.  I guess that is to evoke the pace of a small town.

Tom Selleck inhabits the role perfectly as a man with demons and a good heart, more interested in justice than the law.Paradise's three-person police department will be stretched to its limits with a serial killer or killers on the loose, and the rape of a high school student.  Both will be delicate cases, solved more by Jesse's wiles than by hard evidence or the assistance of the state troopers.  The serial killer will strike close to home before Jesse can arrange a fateful confrontation.This movie plunges right into the plot, without much introduction, a fault made good by the second movie.  Some of the recurring characters are introduced, such as Kohl Suddath as ""Suitcase"", one of Jesse's patrolmen, and Stephen McHattie as the state homicide chief.  Viola Davis is superb as Jesse's other deputy.  Mimi Rogers has a deliciously ambiguous role as a high-powered attorney.This movie and its successors are good quality tv movies that take advantage of the small town setting and the character of Jesse Stone to set a contemplative tone.

Parker's Jesse Stone series (5 novels so far) and was curious to see how Tom Selleck would fare in the lead role of Stone Cold. Going into this television movie, I had some doubts because Selleck didn't really mesh with the mental image I had of Jesse. To me, the great thing about Jesse Stone had always been the fact that he was this unassuming, average-looking guy with unsuspected balls of steel, and I thought Tom Selleck, with his commanding presence (and trademark mustache), would take that bit of magic away from Jesse. But I guess I worried for nothing. Tom Selleck turns out to be excellent as the savvy, complex, and stoic police chief of Paradise, Massachusetts. The author had always depicted Jesse as a flawed human being, still struggling with his inner demons, namely his obsession with his ex-wife (who keeps calling him), which then ties into his drinking problem. Yet, somehow, Jesse still finds the strength somewhere to do the right thing, even if it means circumventing certain rules and policies here and there. Tom Selleck brings all of Jesse's baggage to the screen with an effectively low-key but layered performance. Even though  his character is a man of few words, Selleck still manages to convey the deep emotions being kept in check underneath the police chief's poker-faced demeanor. Jesse also ends up with the driest, funniest one-liners in the movie, most of 'em lifted straight off the pages of the book.Stone Cold, if you follow the continuity of the book series, is actually the fourth installment. The plot of Stone Cold, really quickly, goes like this: The quiet, tiny town of Paradise, Massachusetts suddenly becomes the site of a slew of random killings, with all the victims executed in the same way. Ex-Los Angeles cop and now Paradise Chief of Police Jesse Stone and his tiny, inexperienced police force must ferret out the serial killer(s) and simultaneously deal with a high school rape case. The stakes are raised even more when the thrill-seeking killers begin to target people close to Jesse.Those expecting a shoot-em-up police show will be disappointed. This is a contemplative film that takes its time and goes thru its paces to tell its story. And it's a good story. Its tone is somber and melancholy, influenced not a little by our lead character's world-weary disposition and aided by camera shots of chilly, gloomy New England scenery. This movie, though having its share of suspenseful moments, is most definitely character driven, and the cast does a good job of fleshing out their roles, which is a good thing, because there are more Jesse Stone tv movies planned. I'm eagerly anticipating the dvd releases of Night Passage and also of Death in Paradise. Stone Cold, by the way, offers an 11-minute-long ""Beneath the Surface of Stone Cold"" featurette. But that's it for special features.I recommend this movie, which is a well-acted, quiet little thriller. Jesse Stone is a complicated person who has that feel of ""realness"" to him. Things aren't clear cut in his world; in fact, his personal life is pretty much in shambles - just witness his constant drinking, his unresolved issues with his cheating ex-wife Jenn, and his ""we're-pals-who-have-sex"" relationship with town lawyer Abby Taylor (Polly Shannon). But a sweet relationship to savor is Jesse's friendship with young Candace Pennington (Alexis Dziena), as well as his mentoring of eager, fresh-faced copper Suitcase Simpson (Kohl Sudduth). Tom Selleck shows his commitment to Jesse Stone by not only starring in the movie but also by executive producing Stone Cold, as well as the ensuing Jesse Stone movies. And, if you like the movie, but haven't yet read the Jesse Stone books, then you're missing out, especially with the excellent first novel Night Passage. That Robert B. Parker, he sure can write. So give him a try. And don't even get me started on his awesome Spenser books.",4,"""I'm just a small-town cop.

Tom Selleck performs superbly in the role of small town police chief with psychological problems produced by an unfaithful wife who drove him to drink and caused him to lose his job as a Los Angeles police detective. Stone travels to the seaport of Paradise on the Atlantic Coast where his impressive skills as a detective are tested by a series of apparently motiveless killings. I have admired Tom Selleck's acting more as his years advanced and I await each annual production of a Jessie Stone story with keen anticipation. The acting by the killers is frighteningly chilling. Some minor quibbles. Why can't they find attractive women closer to Selleck's age (late sixties) as romantic interests, such as the gorgeous Mimi Rogers whom we do not see often enough nowadays, rather than produce romantic interests for him who are all clearly young enough to be his daughters. The adorable Alexis Dziena as a 16 year old victim of sexual violence is an impressive actress and obviously has a great acting career ahead of her. I thoroughly enjoyed the incident in Stone's office when her father meted out some fatherly justice to the lead rapist and his obnoxious father. Speaking as a former prosecuting attorney, I would never have agreed to the lead rapist receiving community service and being allowed to return to the girl's school. The alternatives should have been either a different school or juvenile detention. Did anyone notice the continuity glitch when Chief Stone's pal Abby came to grief on a sunny morning in what appears to be a park. Next scene is at night in Stone's home when he is disturbed by an intruder outside the house (the killers).

And though Stone is 35 years old in the first one, and in his mid 40s by now, Selleck takes and makes the role his own. He's perfect in the role, and the whole production of this made for TV movie is top notch. there need to be more smart mystery type shows like this around.When it aired, there were early reports that Selleck was interested in doing more with the character. Perhaps a series of TV movies, or even a TV series. It aired on CBS, and fans of Spenser For Hire (when is that whole series coming to DVD?)would love to see a regular weekly series. Personally, I don't know how well it would hold up weekly. There are only 4 books out to base this on, compared to the more than a dozen when Spenser aired. But with the right scripts it could become a great weekly show. And a hit. But CBS would probably aim for 21 episodes a season, which might strain the concept a little.But either way, this movie was excellent. Fans of Parker,Selleck or just a good mystery should check it out.",4,Let's hope they make more,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",2005,1048,"['have', 'been', '4', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'novels', 'Robert', 'Parker', 'Stone', '35', 'years', 'old', 'first', 'one', 'mid', '40s', 'now', 'Selleck', 'role', 'own', 'perfect', 'role', 'whole', 'production', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'top', 'notch', 'there', 'need', 'be', 'more', 'smart', 'mystery', 'type', 'around.When', 'aired', 'were', 'early', 'reports', 'Selleck', 'was', 'interested', 'doing', 'more', 'character', 'Perhaps', 'series', 'TV', 'movies', 'even', 'TV', 'series', 'aired', 'CBS', 'fans', 'Spenser', 'Hire', 'when', 'whole', 'series', 'coming', 'DVD', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'regular', 'weekly', 'series', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'well', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'weekly', 'are', 'only', '4', 'books', 'base', 'compared', 'more', 'dozen', 'when', 'Spenser', 'aired', 'right', 'could', 'become', 'great', 'weekly', 'show', 'hit', 'CBS', 'would', 'probably', 'aim', '21', 'episodes', 'season', 'might', 'strain', 'concept', 'little.But', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'Fans', 'Parker', 'Selleck', 'just', 'good', 'mystery', 'should', 'check', 'out']",N/A

Parker novel, though sometimes it feels more ""inspired by"" than ""adapted from"" the original novel.  I say this because, even though the story and themes stay fairly close to those of the book, ""Stone Cold"" the movie definitely establishes its own flavor and tone.  And that flavor and tone can be described thusly: dark and moody.  The humorous banter of the book is cut way back in the movie; the book's bright, busy resort of Paradise, Massachusetts is reimagined here more as a grim, chilly seaside town that's sparsely populated and even a bit tired; and there are long, moody passages of silence between moments of character interaction.  All these things bring about an autumnal mood of thoughtfulness and introspection, a mood- I should add- that definitely works and keeps us watching, but is somewhat darker than the book, which had more of a mix of the dark stuff and the usual Robert Parker mischievous observational humor on the part of Jesse Stone and his cohorts.Tom Selleck works fine as the strong but troubled Jesse Stone, making him (as in the book) likable but tough when he needs to be.  It's a well thought out, artful performance:  with all those long, moody passages without dialogue that I mentioned above, Mr. Selleck conveys emotions and concerns with just his expressions and body language much of the time.  And it's more than enough to keep us involved and engrossed.An enjoyable, making of/behind-the-scenes featurette is also worth watching.  It shows that the thoughtfulness, attention to character detail, and general, well... artfulness of the movie were definitely conscious efforts on the part of the film's creative forces.I liked this movie enough to check out ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"", the second adaptation of Mr. Parker's book series about the character.  That one- a prequel to this movie- adapts the first book in the series and shows viewers how Jesse Stone initially landed his police chief job in Paradise, Massachusetts.  Happily, ""Jesse Stone: Night Passage"" is very good, too.",4,"A smart, graceful adaptation of the Robert B.

Are there better mystery-thrillers? Yeah. The Long Goodbye still is the tops, Big Sleep not far behind, currently lots of good ones, Mystic, Diehl's (unfortunately not) critically acclaimed Eureka, Landay's recent first timer in Mission Flats.But, Parker does so many things ""first."" Really, first buddy anti-heros, Spenser and Hawk. Lots of cross racial conversations. Gay friends (you weren't the first, Kellerman), tremendous intellect, tremendous loyalty, and a tremendous code to live by.But Spenser is getting on in years and so Parker introduces Jesse Stone. This is the poorest of the Stone novels so I hope Selleck does more. I liked the book for the analysis of Stone's love of his ex; here in the movie it's kind of superficial and Stone's weakness (thank you Bob) is it's always the relationship. He can't let go of his ex-wife. That's why he drinks. And he was a great Triple A ball player. And that unfortunately gets a thin explanation.All in all, kudos to the cast. It's well filmed and the cinematography enhances the double entendre of the name of the town, ""Paradise."" The serial killers were creepy in the book and likewise here.

He is an ex big city policeman, now a police chief in the sleepy town of Paradise, population 25,000.  He is battling alcohol, and is unable to let go of the memory of his ex wife, who calls him regularly.  All in all, a much more flawed character than we are used to seeing him play, but he does a terrific job, and brings his gravitas to create a character who, in spite of his flaws, we see as an upright man.Trouble starts when an investigation into a murder  quickly develops into a serial murder, with no apparent motive.. meantime, the investigation into the gang rape of a young teenager is ongoing, despite pressure to let it drop.  None of it is anything new to the genre, but  it is written with a satisfyingly slow burn approach, sucking you into the lives and characters enough to make you care what happens to them.Although the subject matter sounds harsh, the telling of it is realistic, and relatively slow moving and subdued for a modern show.  Frankly, for this viewer that was part of the appeal - no blaring soundtrack, no hyper fast edits - just good story telling.  However, if it is an action movie you are after, best look elsewhere.

It's rare that a television actor fits so easily into two roles in their career, but Tom Selleck is perfect as Chief Jesse Stone in the adaptation of Robert B. Parker's novel, ""Stone Cold.""I've been a fan of Parker's novels for a long time which also include his more famous character, Spenser.  However, in many ways I found myself liking Jesse Stone even more.  I think I like him more because he's fallible.  While Stone is very smart, he's got personal problems that people can relate to.This film brings a beautiful sense of style to it.  The small seaside town of Paradise is exactly how I envisioned it to be when I read the novels.  It's a place where everyone knows everyone, and I've always had a soft spot for the New England coast anyway.Jesse Stone is the chief of a police force of four people.  He's a lonely man who finds more pleasure in a bottle of booze than in those people around him.  After losing his job and wife in Los Angeles, he moves to this small town in an attempt to start something over...or, is it an attempt to get away from his previous life?  One can argue both ways.Jesse quickly finds himself in the middle of two cases.  The first involves tracking down a serial killer(s).  The second involves helping a young 16-year-old girl who was gang-raped by some boys at the local high school.  The film balances both storylines wonderfully and makes the viewer keenly interested in both.The dialogue in the film is as sharp as the dialogue of the novels.  Parker is one of the best writers of dialogue, and it translates beautifully here in the film with quick, witty answers and lines being exchanged, especially by Stone.  Selleck taps perfectly into the character.  While Jesse is a somber character, Selleck is careful to make sure that the audience sees the light wittiness of the character as well.  It's a tougher balance to achieve as an actor than most people realize.The supporting cast of characters rounds things out nicely as each becomes a believeable person that we come to care about, especially that of Alexis Dziena who plays the rape victim.The film is simple which is why it works so well.  There isn't a lot of violence.  Instead it is both character and plot driven, and the film excels at both.Quite simply, this is one of the best made-for-TV films made that I've seen in a long time.  I've already seen some of the others, and they are just as good as this one.Whether you're a fan of the novels or not, you will find yourself enjoying cracking cases with Jesse Stone as well as the immense satisfaction of having such a seasoned actor as Tom Selleck portraying him.",5,Great Adaptation of the Classic Robert B.

904984,A27MOT4ZIUAKIW,B0009FU0ZQ,The Jaundiced Eye,"[16, 18]","This made-for-TV movie is based on a best-selling Robert B. Parker novel and features Tom Selleck as a former Los Angeles detective who has semi-retired and become the chief of police in Paradise, Massachusetts. He is faced with two seemingly unrelated crimes that end up being related by the end of the story.First is the gang rape of a young high school girl, which Tom handles particularly well in an audience-pleasing scene in which he allows the girl's father to beat the living heck out of one of the cocky-punk rapists and his father....probably not a realistic scene, but (let's face it) it's just what we all wanted to see.Second is a series of seemingly unrelated murders perpetrated by (and this is not a spoiler, since the information is given very early in the movie) a self-proclaimed ultra-cool, jet set couple who apparently murder for fun and sport. If you are familiar with the old ""Thin Man"" series, they will remind you of Nick and Nora Charles, except, of course, they are repulsive psychopaths. They sip martinis, talk about the nightlife in Miami Beach, and look down their noses at the riff raff upon whom they prey. You become quite anxious for them to receive the same treatment as the rapist and his father, but old Tom has an even more special plan in mind for them.Tom Selleck does what he does best....he plays Tom Selleck. Much like John Wayne, he is just one of those actors who never seems to disappear into his character. But that is OK, because it works perfectly in this story. He is tough, laconic, painfully honest, and just the kind of guy you would want on your side if your daughter had been raped, or deranged serial killers were stalking your small town. Like good wine, he just gets better with age.This was made-for-TV and shown on CBS, probably in an edited form. The DVD version has an ""R"" rating (for no good reason that I can see, it should have been ""GP""), but there is really no intense nudity, cursing, or violence. The production and cinematography quality is excellent, the plot is clear and well presented, the acting is very good, the villains are hateful (a necessity), and the overall viewing experience is quite enjoyable.

But both I and my wife loved this flick.Hard to say why; a mystery I'm still trying to fathom. I think it was just so well put together, with all the tiny bits and pieces fitting almost seamlessly. Selleck was a wry marvel with a troubled history and a character who left so much unsaid that one wondered just exactly when he would explode. This contrasts nicely with so much over-stated acting that considered great and significant these days. To allow just enough to appear on the outside to give a hint of what depths may lurk inside--without making it 'arty' and pretentiously  obscure--it's become a rarity on the small screen and the large.The supporting cast performed similarly. I think the strength of the movie that everybody appeared to have 'depth', without it ever becoming tedious and tiresome--and the plot and pacing allowed this to shine through.A word about the killers. Some would like more 'motive' and more 'explanation' I guess. But why? Sometimes people do things for reasons that nobody but themselves will ever be able to understand. Why do we need this all neatly wrapped up? Why not just say 'they did it because they wanted to and because they could'. It happens; and when it happens, I think our lack of understanding of it--which is implicitly our lack of understanding of the complexity of human nature--is what really scares us.

I am however glad that this was not the first movie in the series I'd watched, because to be honest, if I had, I don't think I would have continued on with the other movies. Jesse Stone first appeared in 1997's Night Passage. The book was a huge success and went on to spawn ten other books, four of which were made into movies, and three original movies, co-written by Tom Selleck. Stone Cold is the first movie, but the second book. They did the second one first, because of an event that takes place, pivotal to the life of Stone. It is something newcomers to the series need to know, but it should have been added on to the end of Night Passage instead. If you haven't been reading Jesse Stone for years, like I have, this film is going to confuse you a bit. It's also not the strongest story in the set. Tom Selleck is amazing as always, and shines in a role that seems to be written for him. Playing a Detective is not something he's unfamiliar with and he comes across very strongly in every film.

It's a cat-and-mouse murder mystery, a little romantic, and high on the ""good father"" scale, at least in the sense of being properly fatherly. It's also a Tom Selleck movie. Selleck is no longer a young stud - neither particularly young, nor particularly studly. That describes lots of perfectly good people. Selleck plays a character that matches his appearance, and still gets some romantic interest anyway.The plot is straightforward. There are two crimes, the first a murder that becomes a series of murders. The other is the gang-rape of a teenage girl. This is a low-brain-power movie, so both crimes are solved and the criminals brought to justice, or something like it. I won't give any spoilers, but I wish the rape were resolved a bit more forcefully. Selleck's character is good, or good enough. The problem is in the script. But this is a popcorn movie, not the place for heavy topics, and not a vehicle for wild heroics.

We watched ""Stone Cold"" and proceeded to watch the rest of the titles in the series within a week. The stories are engaging and the writing is intelligent, elevating the movies above just another ho-hum police procedural.In ""Jesse Stone: Stone Cold"", Jesse Stone [played by Tom Selleck] is the Chief of Police in the small New England town of Paradise, MA. In this first movie in the series, not much background info is given about Jesse, but viewers get the sense that he is battling some personal demons, such as a drinking problem, and also issues with his ex-wife, Jen, who keeps calling Jesse throughout the movie but whom viewers never get a chance to see.Then there are the series of murders that crop up in town - seemingly random targets shot twice in the chest. Jesse suspects serial killers and actually, viewers are clued in early on as to who the perps are. There is also a side story arc about a young teen who is gang-raped by some boys at school and Jesse has to figure out how to bring them to justice. Both these story arcs are neatly tied in, and flow in a seamless fashion.I thought the writing was intelligent - the dialogue is crisp, and Jesse is a man of few words.
