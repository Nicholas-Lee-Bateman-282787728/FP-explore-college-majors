I always wondered how this show did over the 5 seasons it was on.  So I decided that I had to buy all the seasons and watch it and find out what happened!I started watching these just as soon as they arrived.  I really enjoyed these and will watch them all over again. I loved the story line, it's so different and so well, kind of naughty, and the lives of these folks are hidden away and we get to see what they are like! It's so much fun to hate Nicki and love Barb and see what a baby Margene is sometimes.Bill Henrickson and his three wives Barb, Nicki, and Margene provide so much good watching.  Then when you get around to the folks on the 'compound' and their issues and problems and how that is interwoven into the Henrickson's lives... great watching!The ending is a real shocker, never in a million years did I expect that end!This boxed set is perfect if you don't have any of the seasons as I didn't.  The packaging is good as well.

1428004,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004U6GWZM,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[26, 27]","Quick take:  If you own the other four seasons on DVD, just buy the fifth independently.Long take:  For five glorious (and sometimes frustrating) seasons, HBO's ""Big Love"" took polygamy family drama to new heights.  While not always perfect, this show boasted some of the strongest and most underrated performances that you're likely to encounter and challenged the conventions of familial obligations and acceptance.  As a long time fan, I recognize that the show could be uneven.  I'm not one of those people who think that as long as you like or watch a show, it automatically ranks as five stars.  Different seasons can vary in quality, and while ""Big Love"" had its share of growing pains--it never lacked heart or conviction.  Playing with diverse elements including family drama, comedy, suspense, politics, religion, and everything in between--the show became benchmark must-see television as a savvy and sophisticated adult soap opera.I'm not going to dissect the plot of ""Big Love"" over five years from 2006 through 2011.  At its core, however, it is the tale of Bill Henrickson and his three wives Barb, Nicki, and Margene dealing with the trials and tribulations inherent in living a polygamist lifestyle in contemporary America.  Played by Bill Paxton, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny, and Ginnifer Goodwin respectively--this primary quartet is reason enough to accord the show the highest rating possible.  The fact that none of these stars was EVER nominated for an Emmy Award is perhaps the biggest mystery in ""Big Love"" history.  Tripplehorn in early seasons, Sevigny in middle seasons, and Paxton in later seasons all easily deserved nominations.  Heck, while I'm no great fan of Sevigny, her Nicki is an unforgettable character creation and was two years running my favorite performance on TV (she won a 2010 Golden Globe).  Also inexplicably excluded from Emmy competition was the great Harry Dean Stanton as one of the best villains in modern television.  The only Emmy acting nominations the show received were in the Guest category where Bruce Dern (as Bill's ne'r-do-well father), Mary Kay Place (as Nicki's manipulative mother), Sissy Spacek (as an unscrupulous political lobbyist), and Ellen Burstyn (as Barb's disapproving mother) got nods through the years.  Also invaluable to the show was Grace Zabriskie as Bill's mom.  I could go on all day about the extended cast, but there's not enough time for everyone.If I were to break down the seasons to my personal perspective, they would look something like this:Season One (12 episodes): 4 Stars.  A provocative beginning that was finding its footing.  Had yet to capitalize on the family dynamic that would prove so irresistible in following seasons.Season Two (12 episodes) and Season Three (10 episodes):  5 Stars.  Returning, in my opinion, as the year's most improved drama for its second season--these two years were a fine balance of storylines and big ideas.  The central relationships are solidified in perfect harmony and the performances are among the best on television.Season Four (9 episodes):  3 Stars.  A cluttered and overstuffed year in which far too much was going on.  I call it everything-but-the-kitchen-sink plotting.  Some realistic, some outrageous--it is easily the series weakest year, but it is still eminently watchable.Season Five (10 episodes):  4 1/2 stars.  A fitting and powerful end that brings the clan together in defiance.  Eliminating many of the extraneous plot threads of the previous season, this brought the focus back to family.  A solid and memorable ending to a landmark series.The Complete Series DVD is bringing all the previous years together into one set, of course.  All of the original extras included on individual seasons will be provided with NO additional supplements.  Season Five (which is being released separately on the same day) will have a Special Feature called ""Inside The Episode"" which will have insight from the show's creators about each episode in this season.  If you already own the other four seasons of ""Big Love,"" there is no particular reason to invest in the set--just buy the last year.  If, however, you are a newbie to the show--it receives my wholehearted recommendation.  Bye, Bye Henricksons--you will be missed!

Gilbert,"[2, 2]","I don't know that much about Mormons and their history, so I don't know if this series accurately portrays the current religious and political situations. However, I really enjoyed the frank treatment of this unconventional life style. I think Chloe Sevigny did the most outstanding character portrayal a Nikki, as did Grace Zabriskie as Lois. Never been a Bill Paxton fan. Always seemed more of a ""beta"" male, but carried off his character well enough.I had a few scratched disks, and twice an episode near its end would not play through. As is often the case, I purchase these shows months before I watch them. When I received this set I knew it may be a while before I watched it, so inspected the disks and saw the scratches. I played them through the menus and scenes and all items and scene skips worked ok so I did not attempt to return it.

1428006,AIEKMVNA4SBVA,B004U6GWZM,ROCK GODD,"[4, 4]","Everyone comes away from movies, books and TV shows with a different take on it. The subject matter sparks some controversy by some so I'll skip that since if you are here you get what the basic premise is around! What some who haven't seen it don't get it the show is really about desire to achieve and growth, initially around Bill Henderson's character.....who we slowly come to find was kicked out on the streets at 14 and forced to do implied unsavory things to survive (though never told in detail). His legal wife survives cancer helped by Nikki, who we find becomes wife #2 and later their babysitter Margie becomes young wife #3. Bill owns a hardware/home improvement store and is just opening a second. His attempts to open a third are blocked by a shady character from --the compound-- who apparently lent him money to open the first and felt he was owed a piece of each store thereafter. Bill's thirst for being more and power goes on to owning a casino and later becoming a senator hoping to make polygamy recognized and legal.Through much of the series it would seen his legal wife, Barb, just goes along...almost dragged along...for the ride but eventually finds her own voice and calling as do, in their own ways, his other 2 wives. The fifth and final season seems more to be a moral lesson in the fate of wanting more than one should and the consequences with the slow decline and eventual murder of him by a neighbor on hard times over something stupid. Meanwhile each of the three wives evolves immensely by season 5 with Barb going on to become a female minister/leader (or Mormon off-shoot equivalent), Nikki finding emotions and love and getting beyond the compound robotic programming she came with and Margie emerges from empty headed ditz to helping causes and the needy around the world. There's many twist and turns along the way but that is the basic deal and I think many miss this being side-tracked by the stigma of polygamy and Bill's initial control --we see him slowly losing throughout season five-- and ambitions.to prove, maybe more to himself than anyone, that he isn't throwaway trash as he was treated as a child. Don't misunderstand, Bill isn't a bad guy just someone that tends to be caught up in proving himself....sometimes with a conman-like rational. We find out in the first episode of season 5 exactly the breakdown in a scene between Bill and Barb whee he says a husband leads and his wives after consult follow in harmony and her response is less than agreeable.It's an amazing journey even though, as other note, season 4 seems a bit dismal and lost focus in the writing and is somewhat out of step with where season three leaves off but season five more than gets back on track. While I am NOT a polygamist, I can see how lonely people with no one can gravitate to this lifestyle.
