Really enjoy ""Webster"" S2 because it brings back so many memories of watching it when it first came on TV years ago. The first couple of eps in the set are a continuation from S1 which are among my favorites. These are the full and unedited eps that fans remember from the original run. These are packaged in the same type of clear plastic case as S1 was. Season 3 will be out over the summer. Let's hope Shout! puts out further sets.

There were many heartwarming and touching episodes...as well as many episodes that touch on MANY important subjects! As with many sitcoms of the 80's, serious subjects were touched upon in a very honest, straight-forward, yet effective manner! Webster was and still is an amazing 'FAMILY FRIENDLY' sitcom!
