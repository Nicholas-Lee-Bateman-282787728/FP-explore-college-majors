1112030,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000WTLDQ4,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[24, 28]","(3 1/2 *'s) `An Arctic Tale' is not exactly woven as neatly as `March of the Penguins'.  Playful and at times cutesy-pie like the walrus pups and polar bear cubs presented, narrator Queen Latifah gives a comic edge to what might have been just another polar survivor adventure.  Personification is a key component to the charm of her presentation, but this gets extended into the ending, which fails to stay with the story and becomes a springboard to a soapbox lecture at the end.As with any National Geographic special, some of the cinematography (""principal"" [their spelling] cinematographer, Adam Raveld) is awesome.  Without a widescreen TV, I was thoroughly satisfied.  The story is the tender and terrific rendition of one mother polar bear and her cub, Nanu, and one mother walrus and her pup, Selah.  We see the lifecycle go from each of their births and follow their community adventures until each is old enough to become a mother herself.As a G-rated venue, meant to enlighten and entertain, I think discerning information is needed for its potential audience.  Just as the ice splits into two during an arctic summer solstice, the movie can have that kind of ""polarizing"" [sorry!] effect.  Walking on thin ice, I'll try to be as fair as possible, nonetheless.  Seeing the arctic creatures fend for themselves as their domain is melting more than previously, I knew one could discern an environmental message in layers just below the surface.At the end we get children pleading for the audience to amend their lives to help save the characters in the movie.  Now, I am split with a verdict of the ending.  Part of me, having grown up in the seventies, likes the idea of conserving and sharing resources.  Pollution and hording are not okay, and the specter of another energy crisis with garbage looming on the horizon is not part and parcel of my beliefs for a better future.  On the other hand, I start to lose my sympathies when prodigy children lecture me that if I take two minutes less to shower, I will save the life of one of the polar bears.  I think this is when everyone has a right to a claim of disservice.  Conservatives get angry when they have been robbed of their ""G"" rated entertainment in favor of what they say is silly propaganda.  Liberals also have a right to be equally offended for having their causes being brought to ineffective levels, bringing incredulity to the masses.I think if you take the movie as it is, you will be well served by a beautiful and benign film.  Just like people sometimes find it nauseating when you have a highlighter pen lecture like at the end of 'The Ultimate Gift,' people will find it more effective to let the story and stunning cinematography do all the work for them and let the adults do their own lecturing to their children.  Maybe they could have taken their cues from 'Happy Feet' before them.  Just as they seemed to emulate them with an environmental tale set to music, 'Arctic Tale' should have ended with its graphic ""Green.nationalgeographic.org.""

I almost expected Rex Allen Jr. to start the narration.The animals were given human emotions and thoughts which is totally ridiculous.  I could almost abide by this simply as an entertainment factor, but that, coupled with the constant interjections on Global Warming and how all of the Arctic will soon disappear, was a little more than distracting.  In fact, it was quite irritating.  If you like apocalyptic prophecies in a movie, you'll love Arctic Tale.  It becomes more of a commercial for An Inconvenient Truth.  If our world is truly in this terrible condition, then we need to make immediate and drastic changes.  Unfortunately, I don't see it.  How come the Arctic is loosing its ice while, at the same time, they are up to their elbows in snow in Colorado?  Anyway, as unwelcome as this comment may be in a movie review, it shows you how irritating it is to hear someone else's political commentary while trying to enjoy a family movie.

1112032,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000WTLDQ4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 2]","Global Warming is a real threat. The majority of scientists across the globe agree on this (there is a small dissenting group but nothing compared to those that believe in the theory). And wildlife filmmakers Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson believed there were ways to prove it. So they embarked on a fifteen year odyssey to film the lives of two creatures: Nanu the polar bear and Seela the Walrus.The arctic is where these two live, and the arctic is the battleground most climatologists point to whenever they are asked for proof of global warming theory. It is important to let our children know that this area is in danger--as are its animals--thanks to the changes in global climate. And children are who this G-rated film is directed at.There's the cuddly polar bear scene when Nanu is born with her ""brother"", and the protective nature of walruses as they fret over their young. And there's the bathroom humor of the walruses as they eat clams and then expel flatulence in roaring surround sound.But there's also some things that might frighten the very young. Nanu and her ilk are meat eaters; in fact, they love walrus and seal meat. Some bloody carcasses are seen on several occasions, so parents who haven't discussed life-cycles with their young ones should beware. The fact that the movie-makers didn't give Nanu's ""brother"" and Seela's ""auntie"" a name should also give you pause (crewman 19!).To help aid in the marketing of this film, you'll often hear ""From the people that brought youMarch of the Penguins..."" but don't be fooled. Neither director nor the writers involved here were affiliated with March of the Penguins. Both films were aided with production dollars by National Geographic Films but that's about it.Although March of the Penguins held more astonishing film footage, this film can boast some exquisite shots of its own. Following polar bears around as they swim in the open ocean and watching walruses suckle their newborns was something I found phenomenally well filmed. The vanishing ice flows are also pointedly shown as months into what should have been the arctic winter turns into open seas instead of frozen waters.Queen Latifah (Hairspray) does a great job narrating. Never over-the-top, her tone was perfect for the settings. Always.But I think Morgan Freeman did a bit better job during March of the Penguins. All-in-all, it's a superior documentary that stands head and shoulders above this one. But that shouldn't shame Arctic Tale at all. It's a decent documentary.Just decent.",3,Global Warming Is Real,1218412800,"08 11, 2008",2008,2526,"['Global', 'Warming', 'real', 'threat', 'majority', 'scientists', 'globe', 'agree', 'small', 'dissenting', 'group', 'nothing', 'compared', 'believe', 'theory', 'wildlife', 'filmmakers', 'Adam', 'Ravetch', 'Sarah', 'Robertson', 'believed', 'were', 'ways', 'prove', 'embarked', 'fifteen', 'year', 'odyssey', 'film', 'lives', 'two', 'creatures', 'Nanu', 'polar', 'bear', 'Seela', 'Walrus.The', 'arctic', 'where', 'two', 'live', 'arctic', 'battleground', 'most', 'climatologists', 'point', 'whenever', 'are', 'asked', 'proof', 'global', 'warming', 'theory', 'important', 'let', 'children', 'know', 'area', 'danger', 'are', 'animals', 'thanks', 'changes', 'global', 'climate', 'children', 'are', 'who', 'G-rated', 'film', 'directed', 'cuddly', 'polar', 'bear', 'scene', 'when', 'Nanu', 'born', 'brother', 'protective', 'nature', 'walruses', 'fret', 'young', 'bathroom', 'humor', 'walruses', 'eat', 'clams', 'then', 'expel', 'flatulence', 'roaring', 'surround', 'sound.But', 'also', 'things', 'might', 'frighten', 'very', 'young', 'Nanu', 'ilk', 'are', 'meat', 'eaters', 'fact', 'love', 'walrus', 'seal', 'meat', 'bloody', 'carcasses', 'are', 'seen', 'several', 'occasions', 'parents', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'discussed', 'life-cycles', 'young', 'ones', 'should', 'beware', 'fact', 'movie-makers', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'Nanu', 'brother', 'Seela', 'auntie', 'name', 'should', 'also', 'give', 'pause', 'crewman', '19', '.To', 'help', 'aid', 'marketing', 'film', ""'ll"", 'often', 'hear', 'people', 'brought', 'youMarch', 'Penguins', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'director', 'writers', 'involved', 'here', 'were', 'affiliated', 'March', 'Penguins', 'films', 'were', 'aided', 'production', 'dollars', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Films', 'it.Although', 'March', 'Penguins', 'held', 'more', 'astonishing', 'film', 'footage', 'film', 'can', 'boast', 'exquisite', 'shots', 'own', 'Following', 'polar', 'bears', 'swim', 'open', 'ocean', 'watching', 'walruses', 'suckle', 'newborns', 'was', 'something', 'found', 'phenomenally', 'well', 'filmed', 'vanishing', 'ice', 'flows', 'are', 'also', 'pointedly', 'shown', 'months', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'arctic', 'winter', 'open', 'seas', 'instead', 'frozen', 'waters.Queen', 'Latifah', 'Hairspray', 'great', 'job', 'narrating', 'Never', 'over-the-top', 'tone', 'was', 'perfect', 'settings', 'Always.But', 'think', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'did', 'bit', 'better', 'job', 'March', 'Penguins', 'All-in-all', 'superior', 'documentary', 'head', 'shoulders', 'one', 'should', ""n't"", 'shame', 'Arctic', 'Tale', 'decent', 'documentary.Just', 'decent']",Arctic Tale
1112033,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000WTLDQ4,Daryl B,"[1, 2]","I wasn't aware of this film until I saw it recently at a local video store.  Seeing that the folks behind ""March of the Penquins"" were also producing this one, I decided to give it a go and I enjoyed it, though not quite as much as the aforementioned film.The story follows two newborn animals native to the arctic ice:  Nanu, a polar bear cub and Seelah, a walrus calf.  Through amazing filming (taking fifteen years to bring this film to life) we follow these two animals from the beginning of their life to adulthood.  Nanu, born with a twin brother, follows her mother out of their winter den to wander a nomadic life over the ice.  There are constant challenges for these beautiful predators who must find something to eat after spending months under the snow.  Besides the possiblity of starving (polar bears are only successful in 1 out of 20 tries to capture prey) there is also the danger of the larger, more powerful male polar bears.  Nanu's mother avoids her male counterparts at all costs, knowing the dangers they pose to her vulnerable cubs.Seelah, the walrus calf, also faces danger from----yes, polar bears.  But thankfully for her, she has a caring mother and a protective aunt who watch over her with careful eyes.  I loved seeing how tender Seelah's mother was with her, cradling her in her flippers in a seemingly human way.  It was interesting, also, to find out that these animals go on a hunt for three days and their main diet consists of clams.While the story of the two animals and their determination to live in one of the most inhospitable environments on earth is the focus of this movie, the filmakers also make the point of climate change and its effect on this frigid part of the world.  While some reviewers might not agree with introducing this politically devisive issue, it is apparent that climate change affects the animals at the top of the world and beyond as well.  I think its a good thing to include this message of environmental awareness so that young viewers can be educated to the importance of it in our world and how it will affect its inhabitants---both the four and two legged kind.  There is nothing wrong with a child enjoying a film, learning about wildlife in faraway places and also being taught about issues that will effect themselves as well as generations to come.I think this is a good film for children to see although some might be a bit upset about the cruel realities of nature.  A couple of deaths involving both Nanu and Seelah are sad but realistic aspects of these creatures lives.  Queen Latifah does a good job narrating the story as it unfolds and the cinematography is beautiful and daring.  While I won't say this film is as good as its predecessor, ""March of the Penquins"", it is still worth watching and adding to your dvd collection.

1112034,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B000WTLDQ4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","An entertaining and educational family film that makes you wonder what further environmental changes will come to the Arctic and how it will affect animals years from now.""ARCTIC TALE"" is a film by filmmaking couple Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson which have been shooting footage of the Wild for over 15-years and trying to videotape and watch animals and mammals and observe their behavior and relationships in the Arctic.  So, what better but to focus on two significant beings in the Arctic, the polar bears and the walruses, dramatizing the footage and putting a story to show people the effects of the environment on these two animals.  The film is narrated by hip hop artist and actress Queen Latifah.The film starts off with a female adult polar bear who gives birth to a baby girl which is named Nanu and her twin brother.  Nanu is like her mother.  Feisty and wanting to take charge, while her brother is the total opposite.  Having been living in their little home in the ice for several months, it's time for the mother and babies to get some food.  So, it's going to be a learning lesson for both polar bear twins as they learn from their mother on how to find their food and survive the Arctic.Living alongside the polar bears are the walruses and for this storyline, the film focuses on a young walrus pup named Seela and her auntie.  With walruses, their parents hold them while they are fed but in no time, she will learn how to get food in the Arctic but first she must learn how to survive the currents and the ice but also to be careful of the polar bears.As the film showcases the survival challenges that these two young animals must face.  You start to learn that these two are facing a different environment than their ancestors.  The shorter winters, a warmer environment  which is forming ice too late and ice that is melting too quickly is not benefiting the animals.The polar bears can't easily hunt for their food and are restricted to a certain area.  The walruses who typically stay in large sections of ice, are having a hard time finding homes and they try to avoid areas where they may get attacked by other animals.So, with no easy access for the polar bears to travel and find their food, they must find food nearby.  Part of the problem is that there are other polar bears, especially the male ones, who are very protective of their own space and food and will kill other polar bears if they try to get nearby.The film then forwards to a few years later.  For Nanu's mother, finding food is not going easily and the fact that she has to provide for their two children is going to be a challenge.  Unfortunately, the lack of food through the short warm months becomes too difficult and Nanu's twin brother, weak because he's starved and has no strength, quickly succumbs to harsh weather.With the difficulty of finding food for Nanu's mother and Nanu, the only way to survive is by separating from each other.  So, Nanu's mother quickly drives her child off and thus Nanu is now forced to survive on her own.As for Seela, she also goes through some major trouble of getting lost from her pack and being the target of male polar bears but also being swept under the current and being lost from her pack.  So, Seela has her difficulties.  Fortunately, she has her loving auntie who is there for her no matter what.The film fast forwards several more years later with the young polar bear and walrus pup now eight years old.  The environment continues to get worse and the climate is making life much more difficult for them and sure enough, for Nanu and Seela, their paths will cross.VIDEO & AUDIO:""ARCTIC TALE"" is a film that features 15 years of footage.  Filmed by Adam Ravetch, the film is featured ala 1080p.  Some scenes look absolute beautiful, while  some that may appear to be stock footage and thus looks as if it has quite a bit of grain.If anything, ""ARCTIC TALE"" leaves one in awe about the type of footage Ravetch and his wife Sarah were able to capture on film.  From the various ice collapsing, breaking off to very closeup footage of the polar bears and walrus, even footage in their hole when they are hibernating.  There is quite a bit of magnificent shots that the crew were able to get on film.  But with that being said, there is a difference with looking at films of nature with lush greenery, its plants and flowers and colorful animals.  In the Arctic, it's snow, gray skies and dark water.  The only sign of color aside from whites, blacks and browns are the reds that you see in the walrus pups eyes and their mouths.But nevertheless, ""ARCTIC TALE"" does feature breathtaking scenes in the Arctic but its not a film that you would expect to see plenty of vibrant colors.As for audio, I have to say that ""ARCTIC TALE"" sounds incredible via Dolby TrueHD.  I don't think I recall hearing sounds that caught my attention on DVD but on Blu-ray, the sounds of the ice breaking, the winds swirling and growls and noises by the polar bears and walruses really come out.  And it comes out sounding very good on a 7.1 system.  Of course, this is not an action film where you would hear your home theater system being put to the test audio-wise but the film does manage to feature a good variety of sound that just sounds great as it comes from your front and center channels but then hearing things behind you through the rears surrounds and the center rears.As for subtitles, ""ARCTIC TALE"" features English SDH Subtitles , English Subtitles , French Dubbed & Subtitles , Portuguese Subtitles and Spanish Dubbed & Subtitled.SPECIAL FEATURES:Special features included on the ""ARCTIC TALE"" Blu-ray are:* Making Of Arctic Tale- This 24-minute special feature is a short behind-the-scenes featurette about the filming of ""ARCTIC TALE"" featuring Adam Ravetch and his wife Sarah Robertson.  How Ravetch found Inuit people (primariy Pakiki Quamanik) from the town of Igloolik to assist him to film ""ARCTIC TALE"" but most importantly helping him locate a spot where they can find a newborn walrus.  After four years of searching, the group found one.  Most importantly, how he was given the opportunity by a walrus to allow him to film closely as she fed her pup.  When filming the walrus, this is when they were approached by polar bears and from that point on, Ravetch wanted to go for broke and really risk his life in trying to get footage of a polar bear attacking a large group of walruses.  Overall, an interesting featurette documenting Ravetch's adventures.* Are We There Yet? World Adventure: Polar Bear Spotting - A near seven minute special feature from the ""Are We There Yet? World Adventure"" TV Show with a segment as the child hosts go to Canada to get close to a polar bear.* Theatrical Trailer HD - The trailer for ""Arctic Tale"" in High Definition.JUDGMENT CALL:""ARCTIC TALE"" was definitely an entertaining film.  It's hard to classify the film as a documentary because it's a story trying to humanize the challenges that polar bears and walruses face in the arctic by making a film about birth to growing up and eventually becoming an adult.And despite the film being about a polar bear cub and a walrus pup as they grow up, the footage is from 15-years of filming, so many different polar bears and walruses were shot in order to tell a story to tell about how the changing climate is causing problems and is hurting the animals in the Arctic.  This is not a film that shows an actual single polar bear and walrus from birth to adulthood.  Knowing the conditions and the risks the filmmakers put themselves through, not sure if that would have been possible.As for parents who wonder if ""ARCTIC TALE"" is suitable for their children, I watched the film with my six-year-old son and of course, there were questions in regards to a death to an animal and of course, when polar bears and the walruses clash, because of the intense sound coming from your home theater, I know my son was a bit scared.  But other than that, the film is family friendly and parents shouldn't have to worry about the content of the film.""ARCTIC TALE"" definitely has a positive message for children to learn from.  Children will learn about how the climate affects the animals and of course, at the end of the film, children give tips on how people can help benefit the environment and possibly help these animals from the actions that they do in their own home.Also, as many may have been surprised to hear Queen Latifah do the narration, in my opinion she did a great job and put some spunk into her narration.  Having watched quite a few BBC-related nature driven shows and several films/documentaries about animals, it's good to hear something not always straightforward all the time.  Queen Latifah has a calming voice but again, calm with a dash of spunk.Having watched this film previously on DVD, I have to say that I'm quite impressed with the Blu-ray treatment especially when it came to audio.  The Arctic really does come alive with the DTS-HD Master Audio track.  The picture quality has plenty of beautiful moments that look great via 1080p but of course, considering the terrain of snow, sea and gray skies and polar bears and walruses, you're not going to expect plent of colors in this film.  But nevertheless, the type of footage filmed and knowing through the special features how Ravetch and team really went all out and quite far just to get the footage is amazing.Overall, ""ARCTIC TALE"" is a educational and fun family film.

1112035,A2PTBLIHD9SPN9,B000WTLDQ4,"John J. Kirschman ""jjkmusic""","[8, 13]","I just purchased the DVD tonight in the misunderstanding it would be about polar bears and would be handled in the same manner as March of the Penguins.  My son and I were disappointed after paying over $20 and watching it.Unlike March of the Penguins, this movie is about two species: a walrus and a polar bear.  The movie picks and chooses what they want to show from a couple of years instead of giving a lot of details about a specific short time period, as with the March of the Penguins.  It gives general information with the typical video that you can easily find on television animal programs (nothing exciting or amazing).The movie continually brings up global warming throughout (even though people consider me an environmentalist, even though I don't preach it at others, as often happens from radical alarmist environmentalists).  They show how the ice is melting and blame it on global warming without ever mentioning it's during the summer when the ice normally melts and shifts (the March of the Penguins never blamed global warming for the water being so close to the breeding ground at one point of the cycle).  They show how one baby bear dies from starvation and implies it's from a lack of food due to global warming without mentioning over half of the baby polar bears (mother polar bears usually give birth to two bears at a time) have typically been dying from starvation as far back as when humans began studying them before global warming became an issue (nor that there are more polar bears in existence now).I thought it strange they named the baby girl polar bear but not the baby  boy and that they just named one walrus ""auntie"", so I made a joke that I bet they were going to die (kind of like the Star Trek comments about those wearing the red shirts).  Yet, it turned out to be true.  What was their thinking?  How hard would it have been to name them?  Were they trying to spare our feelings by helping us not to identify with them?As for the quality of this movie, it is far below documentaries of the quality of March of the Penguins, Planet Earth, Trials of Life, etc., in every way and is more like what you see on Animal Planet, National Geographic Channel, etc.  I felt they decided to make a cheap documentary and cash in on the success of the March of the Penguins by ripping us off instead of sending it straight to television where it belongs (perhaps that's why it left the movie theaters before I even had a chance to see it).  If you feel something like this movie is worth paying $20 for instead of watching them on television for free with commercials, then I recommend you purchase this.  If you're not sure, then perhaps you might want to consider renting a copy first to see if you like it.",2,Global Warming Agenda And A Poor Copy Of March Of The Penguins,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,2743,"['just', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'tonight', 'misunderstanding', 'would', 'be', 'polar', 'bears', 'would', 'be', 'handled', 'same', 'manner', 'March', 'Penguins', 'son', 'were', 'disappointed', 'paying', '20', 'watching', 'it.Unlike', 'March', 'Penguins', 'movie', 'two', 'species', 'walrus', 'polar', 'bear', 'movie', 'picks', 'what', 'want', 'show', 'couple', 'years', 'instead', 'giving', 'lot', 'details', 'specific', 'short', 'time', 'period', 'March', 'Penguins', 'general', 'information', 'typical', 'video', 'can', 'easily', 'find', 'television', 'animal', 'programs', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'amazing', '.The', 'movie', 'continually', 'up', 'global', 'warming', 'even', 'people', 'consider', 'environmentalist', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'preach', 'others', 'often', 'radical', 'alarmist', 'environmentalists', 'show', 'how', 'ice', 'melting', 'blame', 'global', 'warming', 'ever', 'mentioning', 'summer', 'when', 'ice', 'normally', 'melts', 'shifts', 'March', 'Penguins', 'never', 'blamed', 'global', 'warming', 'water', 'being', 'so', 'close', 'breeding', 'ground', 'one', 'point', 'cycle', 'show', 'how', 'one', 'baby', 'bear', 'starvation', 'lack', 'food', 'due', 'global', 'warming', 'mentioning', 'half', 'baby', 'polar', 'bears', 'polar', 'bears', 'usually', 'give', 'birth', 'two', 'bears', 'time', 'have', 'typically', 'been', 'dying', 'starvation', 'far', 'back', 'when', 'humans', 'began', 'studying', 'global', 'warming', 'became', 'issue', 'are', 'more', 'polar', 'bears', 'existence', 'now', '.I', 'thought', 'named', 'baby', 'girl', 'polar', 'bear', 'not', 'baby', 'boy', 'just', 'named', 'one', 'walrus', 'auntie', 'made', 'joke', 'bet', 'were', 'going', 'die', 'kind', 'Star', 'Trek', 'comments', 'wearing', 'red', 'shirts', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'How', 'hard', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'name', 'Were', 'trying', 'spare', 'feelings', 'helping', 'not', 'identify', 'quality', 'movie', 'far', 'below', 'documentaries', 'quality', 'March', 'Penguins', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'Trials', 'Life', 'etc.', 'way', 'more', 'what', 'see', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'National', 'Geographic', 'Channel', 'etc', 'felt', 'decided', 'make', 'cheap', 'documentary', 'cash', 'success', 'March', 'Penguins', 'ripping', 'instead', 'sending', 'straight', 'television', 'where', 'perhaps', 'why', 'left', 'movie', 'theaters', 'even', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'feel', 'something', 'movie', 'worth', 'paying', '20', 'instead', 'watching', 'television', 'free', 'commercials', 'then', 'recommend', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'then', 'perhaps', 'might', 'want', 'consider', 'renting', 'copy', 'first', 'see', 'like']",Arctic Tale

Nanu, the polar bear cub that we get to watch grow up, is adorable...playful from the very beginning.  And Seela, the walrus pup, though not as cute (she is a walrus after all), is still a joy to watch.The tale of their upbringing by their mothers (and aunts) is really heartwarming, and their struggle to survive due to the harsh artic conditions is amazing.  I also really liked the music, especially the opening song.There was a moral to this story, too.  It became clear that part of the message of the movie was the impact of global warming on the arctic.  In one year, it took the ice 3 extra months to harden enough to be safe for the polar bears to walk on, and they nearly starved during that time.I have to admit, we preferred the ""March of the Penguins"" to this film (story held our attention more and the filming of the penguins was incredible), but this is still a really good film and is well worth watching!",4,Enjoyable tale of arctic creatures!,1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,1034,"['got', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'March', 'Penguins', 'so', 'much', 'Arctic', 'Tale', 'same', 'producers', 'Nanu', 'polar', 'bear', 'cub', 'get', 'watch', 'grow', 'up', 'adorable', 'playful', 'very', 'beginning', 'Seela', 'walrus', 'pup', 'though', 'not', 'cute', 'walrus', 'still', 'joy', 'watch.The', 'tale', 'upbringing', 'mothers', 'aunts', 'really', 'heartwarming', 'struggle', 'survive', 'due', 'harsh', 'artic', 'conditions', 'amazing', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'music', 'especially', 'opening', 'song.There', 'was', 'moral', 'story', 'too', 'became', 'clear', 'part', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'impact', 'global', 'warming', 'arctic', 'one', 'year', 'took', 'ice', '3', 'extra', 'months', 'harden', 'enough', 'be', 'safe', 'polar', 'bears', 'walk', 'nearly', 'starved', 'time.I', 'have', 'admit', 'preferred', 'March', 'Penguins', 'film', 'story', 'held', 'attention', 'more', 'filming', 'penguins', 'was', 'incredible', 'still', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",Arctic Tale

1112039,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000WTLDQ4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 7]","It is impossible to shake the feeling that ""Arctic Tale"" was released not only because of the success of ""March of the Penguins,"" but because of ""An Inconvenient Truth.""  Instead of the Antarctic we are in Arctic, and instead of penguins we have a newborn polar bear cub, named Nanu (of the North I would imagine), and a newborn walrus, named Seela.  This 2007 nature documentary, directed by Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson, follows the youngsters as they grow up in the hostile environment of the arctic.  One of the production companies is National Geographic Films, but it would not be fair to say ""Arctic Tale"" is a National Geographic documentary of the type that we remember, especially with its theme music (but without the lyrics Albert Brooks supplied in the prologue of ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"").  In fact, given the ideological leanings of this movie, it is hard to say it is a ""nature documentary.""""Arctic Tale"" is cobbled together from 15 years of film shot in the frozen north.  So this is most decidedly not a case of following around these two young cubs from birth to rebirth (to wit, the cycle of life).  Nanu starts off accompanying her mother and her brother, while Seela has both a mother and an ""auntie"" (a designation that is social rather than biological).  The lives of the polar bears and the walruses intersect at time in the story, although youngsters worried that Nanu is going to try and eat Seela--or adults wary that the two become unlikely friends in some arctic version of the lion and the lamb lying down together through the wonders of strategic film editing)--do not need to be afraid.  However, parents should be forewarned that ""Arctic Tale"" is about trying to survive in a harsh environment.  Neither polar bears nor walruses are vegetarians, and the grim fact is that these creatures have to eat to survive.  That is made clear, although the filmmakers avoid being graphic in that regard.  Consequently, in terms of what we see on screen this film is appropriate for children, and I think young viewers will understand the harshness of life up north and remember that more than the unnecessary scene supposedly showing us the joys of walrus flatulence.The cinematography, as you would expect, is spectacular.  However, the narration by Queen Latifa makes it clear that this is not just a nature documentary simply showing what happens and avoiding making editorial comments.  Clearly these animals are threatened by global warming, and you know full well that that polar bears, walruses, and other arctic creatures are not responsible for that.  Some of narration we hear is written by Kristin Gore, the daughter of the Oscar and Nobel Prize winning Al Gore, but she was also a writer for ""Futurama,"" so she may well be responsible for the jokes we hear rather than the politics.  As the reference to global warming start piling up I found myself being distracted by the rhetoric from watching what was happening to the animals, and that was enough to deduct one star.Then we get to the end credits and young kids start spouting solutions to ecological problems, suggesting to young viewers that if your family does their laundry in warm water they are basically killing future Nanus and Seeles, then things are just going too far and I have to round down to three stars for my rating.  There were critics who attacked ""Happy Feet)"" as being ""an animated version of 'An Inconvenient Truth,'"" which was pretty ludicrous to anybody who has seen the film that chastises humanity for throwing garbage in the ocean, over fishing, and zoos, but has nary a word about global warming.

Shows like ""Winged Migration"", ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Blue Planet"" are bringing the world to people's homes even as mankind intrudes more and more into the natural world.  One of the latest productions is Arctic Tale, a Paramount Pictures production that examines the life of a female polar bear, Nanu, and a female walrus, Seela over the course of three years.  The movie begins with Nanu's first appearance from her mother's ice den, and then switches to Seela's first swim in the arctic waters.  As the movie progresses, the viewer sees each undergo trials and tribulations such as looking for food, watching out for predators, and learning how to survive from family.  The lives of both cross at several points during the movie, but both make it to the end, as both become mothers in turn.  The movie is narrated by Queen Latifah, who must be working hard to expand her resume.  The photography in this movie is great, and the extra features show how some of the footage was obtained.

1112043,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B000WTLDQ4,Ranny Levy,"[0, 0]","This is a cute, touching and great documentary. This 2007 documentary took years in the making and tells two different stories of a Polar Bear and a Walrus. Nanu is a new born polar bear cub and is with her mother and younger brother. Their mom is trying to teach them the ways of the polar bear. Seela is a walrus pup that is under the shelter of her mom and aunt. She likes wandering off, having fun and learning how to be a great walrus. Seela and Nanu, with their families, are going through everything to try to survive global warming. I love this film because it's a documentary on animals and how they live in the Arctic. Some of it is funny, sad and makes me a little teary. I like the background music as I recognize some of the songs and it is entertaining. My favorite scene is when the walruses eat their clams they begin to go to sleep, but before they do, they start passing gas, but not just one of them, all of them. It is like dominoes, once one starts passing gas they all start passing gas. This is too funny. My favorite character is Nanu, because she is a cute baby polar bear. Queen Latifah narrates this documentary film and I think she is does an amazing job. She delivers the stories so great and keeps my interest.  Directors Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson direct Arctic Tale and do a great job too. A lesson here is that we need to do our part in cutting the global warming pollution. There are easy steps we can do right now by conserving energy on a daily basis.  Animals have their own ways of living which is very different from us. For example, polar bear cubs stay and learn from their mothers for three years and then they go off on their own. This is very different from us, as children usually stay with their parents until they are at least 18 years old. I recommend Arctic Tale for ages 8 to adults. It's a great film for those who love animals and documentaries about animals. I give this film 5 out of 5 five stars. I think it's very good, educational and I like it a lot. See how polar bears and walruses live their life in the film Arctic Tale, the coolest place up north.Brianna Hope B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.Queen Latifah takes us on a magical journey through the Arctic. You won't hear about these famous actresses because Nanu is a polar bear and Seela is a walrus. We meet them when they are first born and follow them for more than seven years. This is from National Geographic. The photography is awesome. The real live footage is amazing and a great chance to see the Arctic up close while staying warm.  Our story begins with the birth of twin polar bears Nano and her brother, and a Walrus named Seela. These animals have had the same routine for hundreds of years but this year is different. The ice is melting and the temperature is getting warmer. We see how they adapt to the changing climate. They have many struggles and have to learn a new way of life. The walruses had the funniest moments and made me laugh a lot. They stay in large family units that do everything together. If one walrus does something the whole herd follows along. They love to eat clams but they are slippery and can fly, float or run away so this is not an easy job.  When the male walruses like a female they can sing to her for up to 50 hours. They make the craziest sounds. We get to see how a mother polar bear teaches her young to survive. I love when she is teaching them how to break through the ice. They are amazing swimmers. They can smell through three feet of ice and snow. It is like trying to play hide-and-go-seek with a bear that has x-ray vision. This is how they hunt for food. Unlike the walruses polar bears like to live alone. My favorite type of whales are featured, they are called Narwhals, or unicorns of the sea. They have horns that can tell the temperature, taste the air and the sea. It is like a giant radar horn. They travel in pods of about 10 up to 100 whales at a time. You get to see a lot of different animals including birds, whales, foxes, seals and many others. Some of the scenes were very sad but nature is not always kind. The songs were upbeat and made you want to sing along.I recommend this for ages 7 and up because there are a few scenes involving what the polar bears eat, which might be a bit much for some. I give this movie 4.5 stars because it made me very sad at times. Although it is reality and the Arctic is not a kind place. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST!

1112044,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000WTLDQ4,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Arctic Tale"" is a National Geographic nature documentary blown up to widescreen proportions.  Exquisitely photographed by Adam Ravetch (who, along with Sarah Roberston, also served as co-director of the film), the movie follows the exploits of an adorable polar bear cub named Nanu and an equally irresistible baby walrus named Celia as they learn to cope and survive (with more than a little help from their mommies) in the harsh conditions of the Great White North.Weaknesses first.  ""Arctic Tale"" suffers from a failing common to many nature documentaries aimed at a general audience - namely the tendency to sanitize and whitewash some of the harsher realities of life in the wild to avoid offending the sensibilities of an often squeamish audience.  We don't mind oohing and ahhing over a cuddly little bear, all bleary-eyed and squinty, finally emerging from the dark den of her childhood to the bright light of day - but being compelled to watch her tear some other poor defenseless creature to pieces in order to perpetuate her own survival would be something else again.  Similarly, it's one thing to anthropomorphize an animal; it's quite another to do so on the level of a Disney cartoon (the animals here do just about everything but talk).  Thus, not only do we get cutesy, folksy narration (voiced by Queen Latifah) that sounds as if it were written for an audience of restless first-graders (which it may very well have been) but a sappy theme song that sets a schmaltzy tone from the outset.  The movie also goes in for such corny effects as playing ""We Are Family"" on the soundtrack as we're introduced to a tight knit community of sunbathing walruses - or treating us to a full-out flatulence contest among the members of that same group.  For some reason, the movie seems to feel that we just wouldn't be all that interested in the lives of these creatures if we weren't somehow convinced that, underneath it all, they're JUST LIKE US.Not that we aren't treated to the darker, kill-or-be-killed, survival-of-the-fittest side of nature as well, though rest assured the ""kills"" are kept at a discreet enough distance to avoid traumatizing the little ones - or even the more weak-stomached and fainthearted members of the adult audience, for that matter.On the positive side, the movie makes a poignant case for the tremendous threat global warming poses to these wonderful creatures and offers proof positive as to just how quickly the rapidly-changing climate is shattering the fragile ecosystem that serves as their home.  Ravetch manages to get his camera into amazing places, so much so that we often wonder just how genuine some of the ""story"" we are witnessing actually is (the movie was culled from over 800 hours of footage gathered over a period of fifteen years, not the mere twelve-month-long period the plotline would suggest).Yet, if you can get past the pedestrian commentary, you'll find in ""Arctic Tale"" a visually stunning, frequently thrilling and occasionally heartbreaking story of struggle and survival, one filled with enough urgency and passion to get us up and over most of the teeth-gritting stuff.",3,stunning visuals overcome schmaltzy treatment,1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,3141,"['Arctic', 'Tale', 'National', 'Geographic', 'nature', 'documentary', 'blown', 'up', 'widescreen', 'proportions', 'Exquisitely', 'photographed', 'Adam', 'Ravetch', 'who', 'Sarah', 'Roberston', 'also', 'served', 'co-director', 'film', 'movie', 'exploits', 'adorable', 'polar', 'bear', 'cub', 'named', 'Nanu', 'equally', 'irresistible', 'baby', 'walrus', 'named', 'Celia', 'learn', 'cope', 'survive', 'more', 'little', 'help', 'mommies', 'harsh', 'conditions', 'Great', 'White', 'North.Weaknesses', 'first', 'Arctic', 'Tale', 'suffers', 'failing', 'common', 'many', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'aimed', 'general', 'audience', 'namely', 'tendency', 'sanitize', 'whitewash', 'harsher', 'realities', 'life', 'wild', 'avoid', 'offending', 'sensibilities', 'often', 'squeamish', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'oohing', 'ahhing', 'over', 'cuddly', 'little', 'bear', 'bleary-eyed', 'squinty', 'finally', 'emerging', 'dark', 'den', 'childhood', 'bright', 'light', 'day', 'being', 'compelled', 'watch', 'tear', 'other', 'poor', 'defenseless', 'creature', 'pieces', 'order', 'perpetuate', 'own', 'survival', 'would', 'be', 'something', 'else', 'again', 'Similarly', 'one', 'thing', 'anthropomorphize', 'animal', 'quite', 'do', 'so', 'level', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'animals', 'here', 'do', 'just', 'everything', 'talk', 'Thus', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'get', 'cutesy', 'folksy', 'narration', 'voiced', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'were', 'written', 'audience', 'restless', 'first-graders', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'sappy', 'theme', 'song', 'schmaltzy', 'tone', 'outset', 'movie', 'also', 'such', 'corny', 'effects', 'playing', 'Are', 'Family', 'soundtrack', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'tight', 'knit', 'community', 'sunbathing', 'walruses', 'treating', 'full-out', 'flatulence', 'contest', 'members', 'same', 'group', 'reason', 'movie', 'feel', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'lives', 'creatures', 'were', ""n't"", 'somehow', 'convinced', ""'re"", 'JUST', 'LIKE', 'US.Not', 'are', ""n't"", 'treated', 'darker', 'kill-or-be-killed', 'survival-of-the-fittest', 'side', 'nature', 'well', 'rest', 'assured', 'kills', 'are', 'kept', 'discreet', 'enough', 'distance', 'avoid', 'traumatizing', 'little', 'ones', 'even', 'more', 'weak-stomached', 'fainthearted', 'members', 'adult', 'audience', 'positive', 'side', 'movie', 'poignant', 'case', 'tremendous', 'threat', 'global', 'warming', 'poses', 'wonderful', 'creatures', 'proof', 'positive', 'just', 'how', 'quickly', 'rapidly-changing', 'climate', 'shattering', 'fragile', 'ecosystem', 'home', 'Ravetch', 'get', 'camera', 'amazing', 'places', 'so', 'much', 'often', 'wonder', 'just', 'how', 'genuine', 'story', 'are', 'witnessing', 'actually', 'movie', 'was', 'culled', '800', 'hours', 'footage', 'gathered', 'period', 'fifteen', 'years', 'not', 'mere', 'twelve-month-long', 'period', 'plotline', 'would', 'suggest', '.Yet', 'can', 'get', 'pedestrian', 'commentary', ""'ll"", 'find', 'Arctic', 'Tale', 'visually', 'stunning', 'frequently', 'thrilling', 'occasionally', 'heartbreaking', 'story', 'struggle', 'survival', 'one', 'filled', 'enough', 'urgency', 'passion', 'get', 'up', 'most', 'teeth-gritting', 'stuff']",Arctic Tale

I didn't even make it to the end of the film with the so-called propaganda so I can't comment on that but if it was anything as embarassing and pandering as the rest of the film, I can understand the complaints. I like Queen Latifah, but the phrases they had her say made me cringe. The usual serious nature-special narration was interspersed with phrases that are desperately trying to sound hip but will be hopelessly outdated in a few years, like ""When your mother's a polar bear, you best be going,"" the walruses are ""all up in each other's business,"" and ""that's just how they roll;"" regarding the walrus whiskers: ""That's right, those sweet 'staches aren't just for style."" The worst is when ""it's time for a game of pull my flipper"" and you get walrus farting sounds.
