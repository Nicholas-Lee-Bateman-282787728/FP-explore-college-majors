It is an original, intersting premise, with great characters. It's mature enough for adults without being too mature for younger viewers, though I would be careful how young you allow your children to watch it--the subject matter and some scenes can be a bit intense at times. Episode two can throw you off slightly because it begins in the middle of the storyline rather than the beginning, but because of great writing, it doesn't take much to get it all caught up. And episode 3, ""Mother"" is one of my favorite episodes. And episode 1 is great.

Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days.

I found the main plot unique and refreshing, and the animation is very well done, especially with the main characters. I developed an attachment with the two main characters with their contrasting personalities, one brother a gentle giant while the other is loud and charismatic.What keeps the DVD from getting 5 stars? It would have to be a little lack of originality and some predicatability in these first few episodes. The first couple episodes are centered around a city in which every citizen is a part of a cult lead by a man who could do miracles. Of course the man cannot do miracles (it's just alchemy). His secret is revealed through the cliche way of sneakily recording his confession that he doesn't care about the town's people, etc.The last episode, I found a little predictable too. It was pretty easy to piece together the facts of why a ghost was killing girls around town. The humor also began to become predictable. At first, the little man jokes were hilarious, but the height seemed to be the only thing the writers could think up material for. The jokes got a little old towards the end. I think it would of been better if they left the last few out.I still have very high hopes for this series since I find the main plot to be far very intriguing.

Boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.Two brothers, Ed (11) and Al (10) at the start of the story are trying to do an alchemical transformation to get the dead mother back. Al loses his body and Ed his leg in the attempt but then Ed gives up an arm to meld Al's soul to a suit of armor in the room where they performed the rite. They've broken the strictest alchemical law against life transformations and they've paid dearly.The story is told with flashbacks to the brothers at even younger ages, showing their mother and neighbors. Al now bodiless and living in a suit of armor and his brother Ed with a metal arm and leg are determined to set their mistake to rights. The brothers are devoted to each other and the interactions between them are poignant and deeply philosophical...not necessarily to them as they move forward to achieve their goals but to us the viewer. The boys have a strong sense of right and a strong moral compass and they know that they may have to set aside their distaste for evil, or just nastiness, in order to get to the references and help they need.The artwork is fairly typical for anime and well done. Action tends to be stills with lots of lines indicating movement. The temper tantrums of Edward are very off putting for me (his face turns half blue and very 'toonish) but it's typical also. While the artwork at times can be distracting the story is strong and very emotional, the characters pull this from average to outstanding -- if the quality continues in the next set of discs and forward this is well worth the reputation it has gained.",4,Equivalence -- to get you must give...,1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,1687,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'manga', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'interesting', 'thought', 'Why', 'not', 'when', 'saw', 'DVD', 'set', 'Boy', 'am', 'glad', 'gave', 'chance.Two', 'brothers', 'Ed', '11', 'Al', '10', 'start', 'story', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'alchemical', 'transformation', 'get', 'dead', 'mother', 'back', 'Al', 'body', 'Ed', 'leg', 'attempt', 'then', 'Ed', 'up', 'arm', 'meld', 'Al', 'soul', 'suit', 'armor', 'room', 'where', 'performed', 'rite', ""'ve"", 'broken', 'strictest', 'alchemical', 'law', 'life', 'transformations', ""'ve"", 'paid', 'dearly.The', 'story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'brothers', 'even', 'younger', 'ages', 'showing', 'mother', 'neighbors', 'Al', 'now', 'bodiless', 'living', 'suit', 'armor', 'brother', 'Ed', 'metal', 'arm', 'leg', 'are', 'determined', 'set', 'mistake', 'rights', 'brothers', 'are', 'devoted', 'other', 'interactions', 'are', 'poignant', 'deeply', 'philosophical', 'not', 'necessarily', 'move', 'forward', 'achieve', 'goals', 'viewer', 'boys', 'have', 'strong', 'sense', 'right', 'strong', 'moral', 'compass', 'know', 'may', 'have', 'set', 'aside', 'distaste', 'evil', 'just', 'nastiness', 'order', 'get', 'references', 'help', 'need.The', 'artwork', 'fairly', 'typical', 'anime', 'well', 'done', 'Action', 'be', 'stills', 'lots', 'lines', 'indicating', 'movement', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'Edward', 'are', 'very', 'putting', 'face', 'half', 'blue', 'very', ""'toonish"", 'typical', 'also', 'artwork', 'times', 'can', 'be', 'distracting', 'story', 'strong', 'very', 'emotional', 'characters', 'pull', 'average', 'outstanding', 'quality', 'next', 'set', 'discs', 'forward', 'well', 'reputation', 'gained']",N/A
867841,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B0006H324I,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[11, 13]","For a long time I thought Fullmetal Alchemist was a childish show, simply by the look it had. But after some time of getting constant recommendations to see this show, I finally caved and bought the first volume. I learned, within the first two minutes, that this is no childish show. A severed leg kind of says as much, I think.So, it had my attention...I went on from there to watch a startlingly good and well-researched story. It centers around the journeys of the Elric Brothers who are suffering because of a mistake they made five years ago when they tried resurrecting their mother. This mistake locked the spirit of the younger brother, Alphonse, into a suit of armor, and the older brother, Edward, lost both an arm and a leg. Undaunted, they now go about trying to fix the mistakes of their past and are in search of the darkest secrets that alchemy has to offer. In this volume, we get a glimpse into the Elric brothers search for items needed to fix their problem, but a majority of this volume is a glimpse into the past of these two kids, showing what happened to them and why they are so determined to right the wrongs they have done to themselves and their mother.To be honest, I did enjoy this enough to give it a five star rating but I don't think it's the greatest anime series ever, at least not after watching the first volume. The story was good but hasn't yet revealed many of the key players, the animation was okay, and the music was alright, but it has yet to completely impress me to the point where I could proclaim this to be the biggest and the best on the block right now.

Besides, I forefelt that this animation series has been based on a pregnant theme.Episode 3 in volum 1 is the one that impressed me most. The two brothers were with a lovingly mother Trisha, a little girl named Winry and her grandmother Pinako, led a care-free life. Edward and Alphonse seemed very innocent, but they were really sensible and considerate, they worked hard on alchemy for their mother's smile. Because they knew that alchemy could make Trisha recalled their father who has left home long ago. They and their mother loved each other, but just because of this, Trisha's death changed the brothers' life, or even everything. The brothers were clever and learned many things about alchemy, however, they were young and innocent children after all, they didn't know that nothing could exchange for their mother's spirit! This serious accident damaged their bodies badly. Alphonse lost his entired body, Edward lost his left leg for the ""truth"" and right arm for fixing Alphonse's soul in the huge armour. But this accident hasn't damaged their hearts at all. Their spirits were higher, the bond between them became much stronger. They knew how important they were to each other. When I saw the brothers set their house on fire, when I saw Edward's innocent and unflinching eyes and the brothers' firm and steady steps, I couldn't hold my tears back. This was the first time that I cried for a Japanese animation's plot.Before ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", I was not interested in Japanese animations and have paid no attention to them, except ""Detective Conan"". When I first watched the first 4 episodes of ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" with my friends, I found this is a connatational animation about brotherhood, friendship, bravery and love. I love animation that have something like these in it.What made Elric brothers faithful and strong? What encouraged them began the journey for Philosopher's Stone? I think it's the strong bond between them. They would never forget how they promised to each other, and they would help and love each other forever. The brothers knew that this long journey won't be calm, either do us.

The first rule of Alchemy ""There can be no gain without first giving up something of equal value"". This anime starts off with two boys in their early years as a youth. Ed and Al being as children enjoying life until their mother died. In a desperate attempt to bring her back to the land of the living they try to resurrect her using alchemy believing that nothing can happen. They were dead wrong. Ed ended up losing an arm and a leg and Al ended up losing his whole body. Now the two of them are in search of the philosopher's stone which is said to restore them back to normal. In the first episode The two of them end up in a village in the middle of the desert. There is this so called ""priest"" working miracles of god where as Al and Ed just interpret it as Alchemy. Of course The village has been brainwashed into believing that its all ""Gods"" will and the power was endowned to him. I personally enjoyed this dvd because it had humor and plenty of action.

I do not own them all as of yet, but have seen the series in it's entirety.I am absolutely impressed with this show. The first time I watched any of it, I was not the least bit interested. I'm a definate anime fan, however, I'm very select about what I choose to watch (no sailor moon, or pokemon for myself thanks!). My original take on this show was that it was over-hyped and childish. At the time I was involved in another set of shows and was content, but when I finished those shows this series was rerunning from the beginning on cartoon network's adult swim, so, with nothing else to watch I thought I would give it another chance.This time I fell in love with it, it has become one of my favorite anime's to date! The story is very indepth, and detailed. There isn't near as much ""fan-service"" as in other shows which can take away from the show itself, and it has relevant undertones.I am a fan of shows like Cowboy Bebop, Trinity Blood, Trigun, Big O, FLCL (Fooly Cooly), Samuria Champloo, and such.

867850,A2WF0O3V2BQLCJ,B0006H324I,Hyacinth Shade,"[3, 3]","Fullmetal Alchemist may be the greatest anime ever made, and I say that with complete sincerety. I was first introduced to this show while channel surfing one night. It looked interesting, so I decided to watch. I am SO glad I did. After viewing just one episode, I was hooked.In this volume, we are introduced to the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse. Both are alchemists, but only Edward is employed by the military; he is the youngest State Alchemist.The first two episodes, ""To Chalenge the Sun"" and ""Body of the Sanctioned,"" take place in Lior, a desert village that is run by a corrupt priest. The brothers are searching Lior for the Philosopher's Stone, which will grant it's user with tremendous power and allow them to bypass the laws of alchemy which demand equivalent exchange, a rule which the brothers are painfully familiar with. I don't want to give too much away, so all I will say is that neither of them have the complete bodies they had as children. These episodes are exciting and set the stage for the rest of the show, even in these early episodes we are introduced, though we may not realize it at the time, to some of the major characters of the show.After Ed and Al leave Lior, the show takes a trip back in time to the orgins of the Elric brothers showing us the path they took to becoming the people they are. The episode titled ""Mother"" is one of the most touching of the entire series. ""A Forger's Love"" is the next and last episode on the DVD, it's not the best, but it doesn't detract too much from the quality of the other episodes.The extras aren't bad, I wish there had been more, but the ones on the DVD were good. The animation is beautifully done, blending CG in well. And the dub is terrific. The voice actors did a great job, but if you are so inclined, you can watch it in the original Japanese with English subtitles. If you do this, be sure to do it before you start watching it, because the subtitles will be a direct translation, and if you turn them on midway through an episode, it will just say what the English dub had to use. Some of the wording is better in the original, but if you like to pay more attention to what's happening on the screen and aren't fluent in Japanese, watch the dub.",5,This is a must see for anime lovers and haters alike!!!,1142294400,"03 14, 2006",2006,2241,"['Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'say', 'complete', 'sincerety', 'was', 'first', 'introduced', 'show', 'channel', 'surfing', 'one', 'night', 'looked', 'interesting', 'decided', 'watch', 'am', 'SO', 'glad', 'did', 'viewing', 'just', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked.In', 'volume', 'are', 'introduced', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'Edward', 'Alphonse', 'are', 'alchemists', 'only', 'Edward', 'employed', 'military', 'youngest', 'State', 'Alchemist.The', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'Chalenge', 'Sun', 'Body', 'Sanctioned', 'take', 'place', 'Lior', 'desert', 'village', 'run', 'corrupt', 'priest', 'brothers', 'are', 'searching', 'Lior', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'will', 'grant', 'user', 'tremendous', 'power', 'allow', 'bypass', 'laws', 'alchemy', 'demand', 'equivalent', 'exchange', 'rule', 'brothers', 'are', 'painfully', 'familiar', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'say', 'have', 'complete', 'bodies', 'had', 'children', 'episodes', 'are', 'exciting', 'set', 'stage', 'rest', 'show', 'even', 'early', 'episodes', 'are', 'introduced', 'may', 'not', 'realize', 'time', 'major', 'characters', 'show.After', 'Ed', 'Al', 'leave', 'Lior', 'show', 'trip', 'back', 'time', 'orgins', 'Elric', 'brothers', 'showing', 'path', 'took', 'becoming', 'people', 'are', 'episode', 'titled', 'Mother', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'entire', 'series', 'A', 'Forger', 'Love', 'next', 'last', 'episode', 'DVD', 'not', 'best', ""n't"", 'detract', 'too', 'much', 'quality', 'other', 'episodes.The', 'extras', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'ones', 'DVD', 'were', 'good', 'animation', 'beautifully', 'done', 'blending', 'CG', 'well', 'dub', 'terrific', 'voice', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'are', 'so', 'inclined', 'can', 'watch', 'original', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'do', 'be', 'sure', 'do', 'start', 'watching', 'subtitles', 'will', 'be', 'direct', 'translation', 'turn', 'midway', 'episode', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'what', 'English', 'dub', 'had', 'use', 'wording', 'better', 'original', 'like', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'are', ""n't"", 'fluent', 'Japanese', 'watch', 'dub']",N/A

867853,A11423AYVMMC4K,B0006H324I,"Jeremy G. Snyder ""Darkstalker""","[1, 1]","When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist and saw a few stills, I thought that it was one of those stereotypical animes with big eyes, fast-talking, and a cheesy story unworthy of the ranks of such fare as Akira or Cowboy Bebop.  However, all the hype made me want to see it and eventually it absorbed me.  It truly is a first rate piece of storytelling.  Great dramatization, characterization, music, etc. all throughout.  It has such imagination to it as it takes place in a world similar to our own except that a few centuries ago, Alchemy was discovered.  Alchemy of course was a pursuit of trying to turn things into gold that was eventually dismissed as a sort of quackery.  In this world though, Alchemy was discovered and developed into a full-blown science with all sorts of laws to it and everything.  Yet, it's very magical in nature as well.  So it's magical, yet scientific, but it works in the context of the story.  The main story itself is so simple, yet develops into a complex plot of intrigue, conspiracy, and tough questions as the series unfolds.  It starts off with two young brothers, Alfonsoe  and Edward Elric who live with their very loving mother in an idyllic small village, mostly free from the chaos of the outside world, although their neighbor and best friend, Winry had her parents killed in faraway Ishbal during a civil war there while they were administering medical aid to both sides.  Eventually the mother Trisha Elric comes down with something and dies from it.  The father walked out on the mother and boys when they were younger (although he does appear near the end of the series), but the boys were able to peruse his old library and learn some basic alchemy.  Being young, naive, and desperate to bring their mother back to them from the grave, they attempt to perform a human transmutation, which essentially is an attempt to bring the dead back to life, a definate no-no in alchemy.  It fails though and in the process, Alfonsoe loses his body, has his soul attached to a suit of armor and Edward loses an arm and a leg (literally), which he has to get replaced with automail (term in the series for metal appendages) from his best friend, Winry, who happens to be an expert on automail.  The reason is of course the Law of Equivalent Exchange, the first tenet of alchemy which states that humankind can not gain anything without giving up something equal in return.  The boys now realize that it's hopeless to bring their mother back but want to find someway to get their bodies back to the way they were.  Luckily, they were given an offer from a mysterious Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang to become a State alchemist for the State.  They're willing to bite in order to gain access to the even bigger library at Central Command, but swear not to sell their souls to the State (which becomes a major conflict throughout the series).Significant episodes:Episode 1, ""Those Who Challenge the Sun"".  First appearances of Alphonsoe and Edward Elric, Rose, Roy Mustang, and the mysterious homonculi, Lust and Gluttony.Episode 3, ""Mother"".  The origin of the Elric brothers, what got them into their present state is all explained her.  The first of a seven consecutive episodes that takes place before the first two episodes.

To my surprise, and a positive on at that, this series is anything but. While it seems to be another fantasy series aimed at creating an alternate world with an entirely different way of living (a.k.a, Naruto or most any other anime available), it almost immediately shows that this series is entirely based on it's characters, and for the most part, the grief they face. From the Elrich brothers and their loses to Scar and his terrible past, it seems nearly every character suffers from some kind of sad event. It should be foretold that many of the things in the series are much to mature for children and that this is a series that isn't afraid to get a little gruesome. Even older viewers may cringe at certain things, and like any good series, there are many extremely emotional moments. However, it would be a crime of any anime fan to pass this up. Though it is quite a tragic series, it's tragedies, along with it's action, humor, and yes fun (believe it or not, the series is actually quite fun) are the reasons you'll want to pick it up. As far as technicalities go, it is very well animated. The action is done excellently (and I am a big critic of action sequences in anime) and the rest is just as good, including L'Arc~en~Ciel's addicting song for the second part of the series.

After seeing the complete 51 ep run of Fullmetal I have to say it's the second best Anime I've ever scene in my life next to Cowboy Bebop.The sheer emotion of the story overwhelms you as you're drawn into a world about two brothers looking to be made whole again.  From episode one you feel their bond and share their saddness over losing their mother and their childhood.  To me this show did what Trigun was only modestly successful at.It takes an emotional story, adds humor, action, and wonderful characters to deliver the goods consistently.  Out of every episode there isn't one you can point to and say...""Jesus was that a waste of an episode"".  The scripts are snappy, the comedy leaves you rolling on the floor at times and groaning in a good way at others, and yes it touches your heart.I strongly suggest you get into the Fullmetal Alchemist series because it will really remind you why you love anime.",5,Fullmetal Butt Kicking,1102377600,"12 7, 2004",2004,1118,"['rarely', 'get', 'hyped', 'Anime', 'days', 'had', 'brief', 'be', 'shallow', 'love', 'Witch', 'Hunter', 'Robin', 'so', 'steady', 'Anime', 'diet', 'was', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'Trigun', 'Big-O', 'judge', 'taste', 'seeing', 'complete', '51', 'ep', 'run', 'Fullmetal', 'have', 'say', 'second', 'best', 'Anime', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'scene', 'life', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop.The', 'sheer', 'emotion', 'story', 'overwhelms', ""'re"", 'drawn', 'world', 'two', 'brothers', 'looking', 'be', 'made', 'whole', 'again', 'episode', 'one', 'feel', 'bond', 'share', 'saddness', 'losing', 'mother', 'childhood', 'show', 'did', 'what', 'Trigun', 'was', 'only', 'modestly', 'successful', 'at.It', 'emotional', 'story', 'humor', 'action', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'deliver', 'goods', 'consistently', 'episode', ""n't"", 'one', 'can', 'point', 'say', 'Jesus', 'was', 'waste', 'episode', 'scripts', 'are', 'snappy', 'comedy', 'rolling', 'floor', 'times', 'groaning', 'good', 'way', 'others', 'yes', 'heart.I', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'get', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'series', 'will', 'really', 'remind', 'why', 'love', 'anime']",N/A

Besides Ghost in the Shell, the never ending Inu-yasha series and playbacks of other anime shows on adult swim this is definelty one anime u cannot miss. When I first saw it on adult swim I couldn't believe the serious amount of seriousness in the series and the first part of the first episode was a little disturbing for me. Because what the first episode didn't do like other animes is that it didn't give a very good introduction to the main characters which many questions from me didn't get answered until later. Like what is an alchemist, why is Ed and his brother ALfonse are metal.

When their mother died, they tried to bring her back from the dead but instead Edward lost an arm and a leg and Alphonse's body was taken and his soul bonded to a suit of armor that was in their home. Now they search the world for the ""Philosopher's Stone"", an item of great alchemical power which they believe they can use to make their bodies whole. Of course, they fall into adventures along the way, coming up against priests that work mysterious miracles and murderous spirits.Fullmetal Alchemist generated a lot of hype before it was even released in America, and I have to say it lives up to it. This is an instant classic. Its greatest power is its underlying poignancy, because the brother's problems were born out of their love for their mother. Who hasn't suffered the loss of a loved one in their life? Except these two boys thought they had the power to change fate. Realizing their tragic mistake, they now rely on each other, and their uppermost thought is to restore each other, a testament of their love if there is one. There are also great moments of humor and the symphonic score accentuates all the changing moods. Masterpiece!There are tons of artwork galleries on this disk, lots of promotional videos, the usual opening/closings, character profiles. It is also available in manga form.A good companion anime to Fullmetal Alchemist is Scrapped Princess.

I was pretty closed minded about the Japanese anime shows I watched, seeing as some ended up being too gory or violent. But Full Metal Alchemist was different, it was a good balance of action, depth and humor.The first episode I saw was of Ed and Al Elric helping this identity changing woman to save a town. It was strange but it had me hooked. The series continued to get more intense and hilliarious. Whether its Ed getting mad at people for making fun of his height or Armstrong and his weird  habit of showing off his torso to Ed and Al, you will laugh and want more as the series progresses. Or maybe you'll laugh at Roy Mustang's unusual ability to predict everything Ed will do,and Ed's irritated response,you'll wonder about the secrets of all the characters and want more.I had heard so many good things about this series from many people and now I saying ""THIS IS A MUST SEE SERIES!""
