964805,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E112BG,A Customer,"[18, 19]","A film of jaw-jopping beauty and deeply held poetical lyricism, Deepa Mehta's spectacular Water - the final installment of her devastatingly beautiful Indian trilogy  - is a film of overwhelming tragedy, a gorgeous homage to the country of her birth and a real testament to the resilience of her people's spirit.Steeping her story in Indian spirituality, Mehta sets her atmospheric film in 1938 Colonial India during Gandhi's rise to power. Times are changing for this country that for so long now has only known British rule. New laws are being passed and the young - particularly the men - are gradually opening to the new ways and becoming more liberal minded.Change, however, seems far from the young Chuyia (Sarala) when her father drops her at an ashram for widows. A child bride and married for economic reasons, her much older husband unexpectedly died. Now considered a financial burden by her family she is sent to a house where she is forced to live a life of rigorous penitence and is never allowed to remarry.Here she meets the Madame of the house Madhumati (Manorma), a hugely fat and authoritarian woman in her mid-70s, who runs the house like a nazi, lauding it over all the other women. Of course, Chuyia has a hard time adjusting to this new life of singing religious hymns every day, wearing only white and begging on the streets for money.People avoid them like the plague; many Hindus believe that if they bump into a widow, they will be polluted and must do rituals of purification. Chuyia doesn't really understand any of this, but she has a sharp tongue and her rebellious instincts upset the other widows who reside in this decrepit two-story dwelling built around a court and overlooking the river, most probably the Ganges.Soon the child befriends Shakuntala (Seema Biswas), a kindly woman who struggles to calm the girl down even as she herself struggles with issues of faith and self-worth. But it is to the young and beautiful widow Kalyani (Lisa Ray), whom Chuyia is most drawn to.Through Chuyia, Kalyani meets Narayan (John Abraham), a law student and Gandhi nationalist who is from a wealthy Indian family is an ardent believer in the civil disobedience campaign of Mahatma Gandhi. Narayan falls in love with Kalyani and their romance plays out against the backdrop of the rainwater and the sacred water of the Ganges where people bath, do rituals, and send the ashes of the dead.Narayan promises to take Kalyani away and marry her, but the ancient Indian faith is very firm about widows remarrying. And although a new law has recently been passed - supported by Gandhi - the men who still have the power are intent to ignore laws that cause inconvenience to them.Mehta totally steeps her film in the social and political - and even religious - ramifications of the day, with Gandhi - and the promise of reform always in the background. This leader has begun to speak against the harsh treatment of women and the caste system, angering Hindu fundamentalists. But to the widows and other outcasts, he is a guiding light and a symbol of hope.Lush and full of atmosphere, Water contains some of the most unforgettable images of startling beauty. Indeed the calm magnificence and spirituality of the landscape - the constant ebb and flow of the water - makes a violent contrast to the oppression these widows must face, all in the name of religion.The impact is devastating and to think that these women, are even today, forced to follow chauvinistic religious rules that were put in place thousands of years ago by texts that are still treated as revered and sacred.

While a slower moving film than the first two it is also the most poetic in atmosphere and much more traditionally Hindu in presentation. Like the two films preceding it `Water' deals with one of those ignored and generally unspoken problems underlying Indian culture. In this case it's the unethical, inhuman treatment of widows.Synopsis: The film begins with the death of the husband of eight year old child bride Chuyia (Sarala), leaving the little girl a widow at an age when she should still be playing with dolls. She is taken to a rundown ashram housing an impoverished group of widows doomed to live out the rest of her life as outcasts. Chuyia forms an immediate bond with Kalyani (Lisa Ray) whose physical beauty has become the sole means of support for the community through the vehicle of prostitution.Through a chance encounter Kalyani captures the attention of Narayan (John Abraham), a wealthy, idealistic follower of Gandhi. Soon a proposal of marriage follows and now for the first time Kalyani envisions the possibility of a new, happy life. However traditional beliefs and social pressures work against the young couple at every turn. As Kalyani battles with the superstitions and taboos that seek to deny her one last chance for love those same social evils begin to close in on young Chuyia threatening to enslave her into the same lifestyle Kalyani has endured. will Narayan have the strength of conviction to save them both or are they destined to remain amongst the forgotten and ignored? What would Gandhi do?Critique: `Water' is a beautifully filmed and heartbreakingly elegant conclusion to Deepa Metha's trilogy. Everything was done to perfection in this film; cinematography, soundtrack, storytelling and wonderful acting with a number of truly memorable performances. Deepa Metha has once again shown how to meld filmmaking with important, contemporary issues without devaluing the cinematic art or the social message.

964810,AKZSYXE0L7ETR,B000E112BG,"Cassandra Ahmad ""Movie Buff""","[1, 3]","I have been a big admirer of Deepa Mehta's work for some time. Because she is really the only voice that shows the ouside world what is really going on in India. The government of India and also hindu's have been hiding these things and so many others from the outside world. She is the only director willing to show the bad point of hindu society especially with woman. I have a very close connection to this theme because i am also related to India by marriage, and have lived there for years off and on. Also Mehta is the only director to start showing things of hindu society. But for years Bollywood has been showing bad points of muslims in india and 99% aren't true. It is ok for them to do that but if they try to make anything about Hinduism then they try to shut it down.Water is a wonderfull showing of the hindu's attitude towards woman. Woman are nothing but property that is bought and sold at marriage, and if they do not give enough money to husband at marry so many times family will burn them.  When husbands die especially if they are young so many times are forced out from their husbands homes because they are considered bad luck. of course not that many hindu's follow  this idea of putting woman in ashrams. but it still happens today, and they do end up into a life of prostitution as it shows in this movie. Actually this movie shows you a more tammer side of what happens to widows in india. They used to actually throw woman into their husbands funeral piers by force.This movie has a wonderfull story line and also lesson about what is actually going on and outsiders have no idea. The acting was good but it would have been alot better if the original cast of Shabana Azmi playing the lead. But unfortunatly the indian government forced them to shut down filming in India and also forced Shabana Azmi out of the film. So if she would have been in it then it would have been the best acting. Next I think Deepa Mehta needs to show about abortion in india, and how many hindu babies are being aborted by their parents just because they are girls. Woman being forced to have abortion even if they don't want. Also how much india's population is going uneven with more boys then girls. In some places as much as 30% girls to 70% boys.But I advise anyone who wants to see some reality that is going on under wraps, then you need to see every one of Deepa Mehta's movies.

She befriends a beautiful young woman named Kalyani (Lisa Ray) who is used by the hateful and corrupt Madhumati (Manorama) to earn money for the house as a prostitute. Chuyia also finds motherly support from Shakuntala (Seemas Biswas), an intelligent, compassionate widow who is angry about her circumstances but feels unable to change them.Kalyani develops an intense mutual attraction with Narayana (John Abraham), an idealistic, educated young man from the upper class. But a relationship between them is strictly prohibited by Hindu tradition, which considers widows to be ""polluted"" and not allowed to re-marry. Still their romance blossoms in a series of secret encounters and Narayana suggests they get married and leave for Calcutta. Madhumati learns of this and locks Kalyani in her room. But Shakuntla manages to free Kalyani and sends her off to marry Narayana. However, their romance ends in tragedy when it turns out that Narayana's father knows of Kaylani's past as a prostitute. Narayana still wants to marry her. But the shamed Kaylani ends up drowning herself in the Ganges River. The monstrous Madhumati then attempts to turn Chuyia into a child prostitute. But she is saved from this horrible fate by the brave Shakuntala, who feels empowered to act by the social changes taking place in India during this era of Gandhian inspired reform. Finally, Shakuntala manages to bring traumatized little Chuyia to Narayana, just as he is leaving on a train with Gandhi and other activists.This film definitely has an epic tone, especially in its ""Romeo and Juliet"" like story of the tragic romance between Kalyani and Narayana. I don't typically go for this style of film. But ""Water"" manages to pull it off fairly well, especially since the film is set in 1930's India. Still what I think takes this movie to a higher level is that it doesn't just focus on their star crossed romance. But instead challenges the dogma of Hindu tradition which called for widows to live out their existence as ""polluted"" wretches segregated from society. Of course, this was a hopeful time in India, as Gandhi and his followers were trying not only to achieve independence from Britain. But also uplift the downtrodden, including Untouchables and women. The sad reality is that the Gandhian movement only manged to transform Indian society to a certain extent. Even today most women, especially among the poor, are still considered second class citizens in India and severely oppressed, a fact that I witnessed first hand while visiting the country. Even worse, there is currently a strong Hindu fundamentalist movement which has gained a serious level of political power while trying to roll back the social reforms of modern India.

She says no, and her father responds, ""Your husband is dead; you are a widow now."" Chuyia is eight years old, and as one of India's 34 million widows her head is shaved and she is banished for life to a home where Hindu widows live in penitence. They are a source of ritual impurity for anyone who touches them or is even darkened by their shadow. But this does not stop the authoritarian and obese Didi who runs the home from pimping. Director-writer Deepha Mehta (who received death threats for her work and had to move filming to Sri Lanka) uses Chuyia's plight as a window onto the larger degradation of widows by crafting a major sub-plot when another widow, improbably gorgeous Kalyani, falls in love with the liberal-minded Brahmin and follower of Ghandi Narayan. To divulge the twists and turns that their relationship take would spoil unexpected suspense. The marginalization of widows in Hindu society, remarks Narayan, is all about ""one less mouth to feed, four less saris, and a free corner in the house.

At the beginning, the story seems to be focused mostly on Chuyia, a seven year old girl whose life is over for being a widow. However, as the film progresses, we have a peak into the lives of two other women: Kalyani, who is being prostituted by the ashram master and the help of a transgender pimp, and Shakuntala, a strong woman who is struggling with making sense of that belief that forbids widows to remarry. We're also introduced to Narayan, the son of a Brahmin who, inspired by Ghandi, questions how unreasonable indian traditions can be.Water isn't a motion picture but a ""motion painting"". It flows slowly like the Ganges (although, apparently, it was shot in Sri Lanka), but every minute of it is so beautiful and enthralling that you never want it to end. The soundtrack adds a hypnotizing element to the stunning photography.

964815,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000E112BG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[12, 13]","Water is far too powerful and moving to be called a mere film; this is a brave cinematic triumph that illuminates a tragic issue that few in the West know the first thing about - namely, the historical plight of widows in Hindu society.  It also has much to say about modern Hindu culture as well, though, as the mistreatment of widows is still a problem in India today - and quite a touchy one, as made clear by the reaction of Hindu fundamentalist groups in India during filming.  As I watched the end credits of the film roll, I was a little puzzled as to why the movie was shot in Sri Lanka, but now I have learned that the original production was basically run out of Upper Pradesh, India, because it was attacked as anti-Hindu in nature.  It took four years for the filming to be taken up again - this time outside of India, with the two lead roles played by one actress who only spoke Hindi as a second language (Lisa Ray) and another who spoke no Hindi whatsoever before filming began (Sarala).  Obviously, the subject matter makes for a most touchy issue; Hinduism is the world's oldest religion, so we're talking about traditions ingrained into much of the population for thousands of years.I first became fascinated with India a little over a year ago, and I found this film to be nothing short of shocking, exposing a part of Hindu culture I knew nothing about.  I knew that widows had to give up their own lives in the funeral pyres of their dead husbands many centuries ago, but I had no idea that widows still gave up the majority of their lives here in the modern day.  It is heartening to discover that Gandhi opposed this traditional practice.  This great man was about much more than peaceful opposition to British colonialists and the elimination of the caste system - and widows were basically an anonymous cast unto themselves, separated and shunned by society.  It's especially tragic to see a young and vibrant life essentially snuffed out by this practice - and it's doubly tragic that so many of these women did not question it, as they had been brought up to believe they deserved to be punished for not dying when their husbands died.  It's even more especially tragic when such widows included little girls.Chuyia (Sarala) is one such girl, widowed at seven years old.  She accepts the ritualistic shaving of her head to indicate her widowhood, but she is far too young to understand why her parents abandoned her, leaving her in the care of a group of widows forced to live outside of normal society for the rest of their lives.  Initially rebelling against her new position in life, she finds only one kind soul, a beautiful young lady named Kalyani (Lisa Ray).  Kalyani lives somewhat apart from her fellow widows; she has a dog (which is forbidden) and she also still has long hair - but only because the dominant widow forces her into prostitution.  Kalyani soon meets a young man named Narayan (John Abraham), a modern thinker and follower of Gandhi.  They fall in love, and Narayan (to his mother's horror) asks her to marry him.  That sets even more dramatic events in motion, leading up to a conclusion that will more than likely have you in tears.As you may have guessed, this is a pretty depressing film, with a number of very uncomfortable, heart-breaking scenes.  Your heart just goes out to so many of these widows, from the outrageously young, such as Chuyia, to the very old (such as Auntie, who has spent the better part of a century dreaming about the sweets she has been unable to taste since the time of her own childhood wedding).  Amidst so much hopelessness, however, there is a modicum of hope embodied in one very religious woman (Seema Biswas) who begins to question the values she has always believed in - and in the end there is also Gandhi, who has returned to his native land and just been released from prison by the British (Water is set in 1938).I really wish I could convey to you the raw power and emotion of this extraordinary film.  The story is woven together in a masterly way, evoking almost infinite meaning from so many small incidents and events, and on a surprisingly large number of issues.  The cinematography and sparsely effective musical score simply soar, and the performances of the entire cast could not be more impressive.  I don't know if I've ever seen a film express so much meaning so effectively.

964816,A11L5M4MJP00UW,B000E112BG,"David L Hutchins ""Music Lover""","[5, 6]","This is an absolutely stunning movie.  It is gorgeously photographed which helps to offset the somewhat somber nature of the story.  Have a box of Kleenix handy as this is an emotionally powerful movie.  Those fundamentalists who threatened the life of the director and destroyed the sets and ultimately forced the movie out of India should be ashamed of themselves.  I suppose they were upset because the movie exposed the harsh truth of how widows were treated in India (and perhaps some who still are treated this way).  Sometimes the truth hurts and I think those who protested and fought against this movie do not truly believe that their treatment of widows is right and proper.  If they did honestly believe it, they would have no problem at all with the movie which portrays it as it was (and perhaps still is, in some cases).  They would have no shame if they truly believed they were right and just.  Obviously they don't believe it is right, so it is something that must be hidden; a deep dark secret that makes them look bad.  The interesting thing is that their protests probably made this movie better known than it would have been otherwise.  Instead of keeping it from being made, they strengthened the resolve of the director to make this movie, as well as bringing more attention to it.  I honestly don't think this movie is in any way detrimental to the religion or to the perception that people have of India.  Would anyone get upset if a movie was made about the injustices that America perpetrated on black slaves or native Americans in our past (and sometimes even now)? That's doubtful. How is this any different?; it is set in the 30's, after all.  Things have changed a lot since then in India, as they have in America and many countries.  It's pathetic the way women are treated in some parts of the world.

Almost every religion has its dark side as their main objective is to control others. What they don't understand is, that abuser is never going to be happy either, because people who feel need to abuse feel powerless to begin with.The reason I take one star down, because I think, viewers should be given a bit more of history and situation now, if not in the movie, then in special features.

I was delighted with the images, landscapes, actors, dialogues, but at the same time I became more and more indignant as the film went by.I can't digest this kind of treatment towards women. It really amazes me how so many and different cultures around the world think of women as second class citizens, or worse. As impure, as sinners, as disposable objects.

With Earth she covers the carnage, brutality and massacres of the Indian civil war that broke out at the state of Independence from Britain.  Fire covers sexual politics and is an incredibly brave film which is taboo shattering for Indian audiences. With ""Water"" Mehta has created a masterpiece.  You cannot sit and watch this film without feeling the pain of the discarded Hindu widows.  The little child that does not even know she has been married is forced into a secluded and highly restrictive life, made to feel little higher in society than a leper.  Looked down upon by other Hindus with a disdain that is imbued with hatred, these poor women must fend for themselves till death.Of course Mehta is outraged that India remains so hidebound to traditions that are anti-life.  This movie caused a sensation in India when she tried to film it there.  At the outset she had been given permission, the script had been vetted, the actors selected, sets built.  Then came the backlash of vile innuendo spread by the BJP in the press.  Not knowing any better, people gathered at the film set, protested and then trashed the set, causing a distraught and shocked Mehta to exit India.  The film remained on the shelf, she did more films and then miraculously raised the budget all over again; this time removed to Sri Lanka with a new cast.What is miraculous is that looked at now the film seems to be perfect and could not have been improved upon had it been shot earlier.  The cast completely shines from top to bottom.  The young girl chosen to play the child widow was a Sri Lankan and Hindi was not a language she knew.  Instead of shirking from this, Mehta worked with her and the little girl spoke her lines phonetically; as a non-Hindi speaker I could not have detected anything.  She is a perfectly natural actress and her portrayal is very powerful.This is a very heartbreaking film and you simply cannot see it without feeling grief and yet at the very end, hope.  As of early 2007 the film has yet to play in India although I hear that plans for it's premier are for later this year.  I'll believe it when I read of it.

964822,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000E112BG,Grady Harp,"[12, 13]","This sad statement is the core of the film's message about the reason for the sequestration of widows from Indian society.  The Hindu religion states that a woman is half her husband and when she becomes a widow (no matter the age - many children are married to very old men) she must live a chaste life without the joys of the world, becoming a virtual begging outcast.  But despite this 'religious' reason for sending the thousands of widows into seclusion in the city of Varanasi, the apparent true reason is to not have them take up space and money in the homes of the deceased!WATER is Deepa Mehta's masterpiece of writing and directing, creating a film of such extraordinary beauty and sensitivity despite all plots to keep her from turning her 'anti-Hindu' story into  a movie for public consumption.  Years of frustration preceded the final product, a film that had to be shot in Sri Lanka to avoid the crowds of protestors in Mehta's beloved India.  The story is simple yet profound: Chuyia (Sarala) is an 8-year old girl married to an elderly man in an event she doesn't even remember.  But as a new widow her father takes her to an ashram in Varanasi where her head is shaved and she wears a colorless sari and must live with the other outcast widows.  She is befriended by the religious and kind Shakuntala (Seema Biswas) who attempts to protect her from the forces that make life difficult and by  Kalyani (the stunning model turned fine actress Lisa Ray) who befriends her, shares her puppy and her secrets, and in the end helps Chuyia understand the injustices of the custom of isolating widows.  Kalyani is 'farmed out' by eunuch procurer Galabi (Raghuvir Yadav) to keep her humanness alive.  But a handsome commoner and follower of Gandhi (the year is 1938), Narayan (John Abraham), is struck by both Chuyia and Kalyani and falls in love with Kalyani, a love that is never to be realized in marriage for reasons unveiled in the story.  At film's end there is a sense of hope for the widows as introduced by the rise of Gandhi and his philosophy and the film's closing is immensely touching.Mehta knows how to tell her story well and is not only supported by a strong cast but also by a fine production crew: the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens is incandescently moody and gloriously beautiful and the original music by Mychael Danna and A.R. Rahman blends Indian songs with Western orchestral writing in a perfect union that works well with the story.  This is one of those films that not only stands alone as a strikingly beautiful creation, but it is also a film that informs us about other cultural patterns about which most of us are ignorant.  It is a masterpiece on every level, a film to add to your library along with the other two parts of Mehta's trilogy - Fire and Earth.

Writer/director Deepa Mehta ignores the v&eacute;rit&eacute; style of layering ugliness upon ugliness to enhance a tragedy. So, instead, we revel in the beauty of nature. Of Indian artistic style.

964828,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B000E112BG,Jeff  Farrow,"[0, 0]","Even before the opening credits, I could see by the gorgeous cinematography that WATER was going to be an outstanding film--and it is. The movie takes on the Hindu caste system & focuses on the plight of lower caste widows during the early rise of Gandhi in the 1930's. The widows in the film are sent by relatives (as in parceled out like an ordinary commodity) to a sort of rundown hostel in the poorest section of New Delhi. A toad like elderly female tyrant runs it--but she's not totally bad, she deeply mourns the death of a pet parrot--AND she likes to blow Ganga while praising Shiva...she might be cranky & look like Yoda, but, hey, she's my kind of gal!The film revolves around 2 major plots: The life of a little girl widowed at the age of 7, and the love between a beautiful widow & prostitute (?) with an upper caste attorney who supports Gandhi & the social modernization movement. The actress Sarala who plays the young girl (making her Bollywood premiere) is outstandingly natural & a pure joy to watch. The adult young woman & the upper caste man are appropriately attractive & star-crossed.In one scene a very old woman is talking to the girl, telling her that she was also widowed as a child. The happiest moment she can recall was her wedding feast (when she too was 7) where she ate all kinds of candies & sweets. Now she doesn't have the money to buy sweets & often dwells on her only happy memory during her entire lifetime and she constantly reflects on it--often--as us old folks are prone to do. The little girl surprises the old lady while she's sleeping, leaving a large confection near her head for the old woman to see when she wakes up. The woman dies that same night. I don't recall if she at least had the time to wake-up & see her new friend's act of generosity.When discussing life in general, another widow remarks that if a woman were really, really good in this life, when she dies she might be blest enough to return (reincarnate) as a man. This widow is also spiritually attached to a Hindu priest & his modest Ashram (spiritual teaching/healing center). This sub-plot illustrates how people in general often seek compensation in religion for the hardships of life, a life that--more often than not--seems wholly indifferent to the human condition.Another character of interest in the movie is a male transvestite who always wears women's clothes--sort of like the ""Gaudy Goddess Line"". I'm not exactly sure what h/she was meant to convey in the movie, but I do know that there is a Hindu deity named Kartikeya who is androgynous. The actor does seem to ""parrot"" (or parody) the emotions of the old tyrant, and together they appear to burlesque a mutually exaggerated emotional view of life.Now on to negative reactions tothe socio-religious-political implications of WATER.(Whew!)The people who gave this film a single star (and probably would have withheld even that if Amazon review rules allowed it), in no uncertain terms denounce the film on political & religious grounds. A lot of the dissention centers on the ancient Texts of Manu (specific date uncertain, but generally between 200 BCE-200 CE). The texts deal with the subject of Hindu spiritual law. As much I am drawn to Hindu practices & incorporate them into my personal religious mythology, I don't have the educational background at the moment with which to weigh in on the specifics of the reviewer's arguments. They are quite vituperative in their objections to WATER.Perhaps there is a certain degree of truth on both opposing sides?The events as portrayed in WATER occurred 70 + years ago. Certainly the United States, for example, has experienced a near revolutionary reform of race relations from the 1950's onward. I am aware that there remain today extremely backward ""spiritual"" practices in India such as astrology & the Guru racket (not all gurus are confidence tricksters, but many are). Women aren't jumping into the husband's funeral pyre (i.e. suttee) anymore (I hope.) Then there's the artistic aspect: I find abhorrent the politics & twisted mythology of the 1930's Nuremberg Nazi documentary, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL by Nazi enthusiast Leni Riefensthal, but nonetheless I recognize it as a masterpiece and--yes--work of genius. The film's artistic merit transcends its' own propaganda--and I don't mean to equate WATER with racist fascism, but it's always difficult when dealing with diametrically opposed symbolism & belief systems.Obviously I don't have ready answers to the political & religious objections raised by other reviewers, but I do want them to know that I don't dismiss their concerns, and will look closer into the issues.In conclusion--and on a much more positive note--the wonderful fusion composer, Mychael Danna, is credited for the softly woven soundtrack of WATER.Celtic Tale: Legend of

964835,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B000E112BG,Linda Linguvic,"[5, 6]","The story is set in 1938, when Mahatma Gandhi was starting to influence the people of India.  The film opens with a young girl of eight riding in a cart next to a very sick man.  We soon learn that this man is her husband, even though the marriage has not yet been consummated.  The man dies and the little girl is confused as her head is shaved bald and she is forced to put on a white sari.  Then she is taken to a ""house of widows"" where she is expected to live for the rest of her life.  At first she rebels.  But then she makes friends with women, one of whom is in her twenties and has been allowed not to shave her head because she is taken by a boat across the river to service wealthy men.  Another one of the women is in her forties and even though she is a devoted Hindu, she questions the traditions that force widows to live in poverty and not let their shadow fall across that of a married woman.  But the saddest of all is an old woman in her 90s, who has lived in this place since childhood.  Widows are not allowed to eat sweets and can only eat one sparse meal a day, but this old lady only dreams of sweets and talks lovingly about her wedding feast where she had a wonderful time feasting on such treats.  This was many years ago because she, too, was widowed in childhood.The little girl is a delight and soon she wins the hearts of all the women in the ashram.  She also won my heart.  And I could not help but be saddened by her plight and all her sister widows.  The young woman with the long hair has a romance with a handsome young rich man who is a follower of Gandhi.  It looks as if they can find happiness.  But, alas, that is not to be.  Often, it was hard to watch and I thought a little too much time was spent developing the romance between the couple.  Also, some of the horrors were just repetitive and started to lose their impact.  Basically, though, this is a really fine film.There was one thing that bothered me, however.  This was the fact that none of these widows had children.  I wanted to know more and spent more than an hour on Google trying to find out what happens to a widow with children.  Does she take them with her to the Ashram?  Does she live in the house with them?  Does she have to leave them behind?  These questions are still unanswered.  It does seem that all of the widows in the film had been child brides with unconsummated relationships.  I was waiting for them to talk about widows with children.  But they never did, which, I think is a weakness of the film.I definitely recommend ""Water"" to anyone interested in the expanding his or her knowledge of the world's customs.  There is really so much we don't understand.  And, as the film faded to an end, a descriptive sentence on the screen informed us that there are over 34 MILLION widows living in India today.  I can't help wondering how many are still living by the old rules.  It is all so very sad.",4,The plight of child widows in 1938 India.

It explores the plight of widows in traditional Hindu culture, where women are condemned to a grim, rudimentary existence after their husbands die. Driven by characters as much as by its cause, this is not a bleak film. On the contrary, ""Water"" is breathtakingly beautiful. In India in 1938, young Chuyia (Sarala) is widowed at the age of 8. By religious law, when a man dies, his wife may either be cremated with him, marry his brother, or live the life of an ascetic -chaste, poor, and pious. Chuyia's head is shaved, her jewelry removed, and she is sent to live in an ashram with other widows of all ages. She is befriended by a pretty widow named Kalyani (Lisa Ray), watched over by the devout and generous Shakuntula (Seema Biswas), and often at odds with the ashram's callous matriarch Madhumati (Manorama), who pays the rent by prostituting Kalyani. A handsome law student with progressive politics, Narayan (John Abraham), is smitten by Kalyani. But it is sinful for widows to remarry, and Kalyani is a prostitute besides.The story of making ""Water"" is a drama in itself. Filming in India in 2000 was shut down by violent protests by religious fundamentalists, who believed the film was anti-Hindu. Deepa Mehta's view is that a misinterpretation of religious texts has perpetuated the dreadful state of widows in Indian culture, which is actually the result of economics. If a widow is sent away upon the death of her husband, her own family does not have to pay to feed or house her, and her would-be inheritance remains in her husband's family. In any case, there were riots, Deepa Mehta was burned in effigy, and the film's sets were thrown into the river. Four years later, the film was recast and the production moved to Sri Lanka, where filming began again. All of the temples and buildings that you see are sets by production designer Dilip Mehta. Sarala, who plays Chuyia, is Sri Lankan and does not speak a word of Hindi. She learned all of her lines phonetically. Somehow that doesn't even seem odd amid this international cast and creative crew.Giles Nuttgens' cinematography is a force in this film. Everything appears so alive and luminous that I wanted to step into this world to be bathed in its beautiful light and touch its delicate features. The light has a striking purity. The film's score by Canadian Mychael Danna and songs by Indian composer A.R. Rahman are an ideal auditory accompaniment to ""Water""'s visual splendor. Although it focuses our attention on the plight of widows in India, ""Water"" is not a realistic film on the narrative level. Kalyani and Narayan are idealized characters. She is pure, lovely, and suffering. He educated, and socially progressive. To Narayan, Kalyani is a romantic figure, a fragile, innocent soul in need of rescuing. The idea that a wealthy, educated man would want to marry an illiterate peasant prostitute who will never understand his causes or his world view seems far-fetched. But Kalyani's reticence and Narayan's sensitivity draw us in. Narayan is a change of pace for John Abraham, who is an Indian supermodel and Bollywood star. Lisa Ray is Canadian, also a supermodel in India, but Hindi is not her first language. Director Deepa Mehta has a real talent for casting the perfect actors from seemingly unlikely choices.For all of Kalyani and Narayan's beauty and sympathy, ""Water"" is not their film. Shakuntula is the character who has an arc, and Seema Biswas gives the film's great performance. She personifies the conflict between conscience and faith that is at ""Water""'s core. (You many remember Seema Biswas from her lead role in ""Bandit Queen"".)  Manorama, who has acted in an extraordinary 1301 movies, is memorably sharp as the matriarch Madhumati. Professor of Hindi literature Dr. Vidula Javalgekar plays the kindly, sweet-toothed, elderly widow Patiraji, a woman who must be very unlike herself. ""Water"" is simply a gorgeous sensory experience that movie-lovers won't want to miss. In Hindi (and some Sanskrit) with English or Spanish subtitles or English captions.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): ""Behind the Scenes"" (20 min) includes interviews with writer/director Deepa Mehta and the cast. Mehta talks about the controversy surrounding the film and its themes. The actors discuss Mehta's directing style, mastering the period mannerisms, and their characters. ""The Story Behind the Making of Water"" (4 min) is about the controversy and the ill-fated first attempt to film ""Water"". There is a good, continuous audio commentary by Deepa Mehta in which discusses the sets, actors, character development, cinematography and lighting, the film's score, and provides additional information about Indian culture.",5,A Social Conscious Film of Uncommon Beauty.,1157414400,"09 5, 2006",2006,4804,"['Water', 'third', 'film', 'writer/director', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'elemental',

964843,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000E112BG,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[10, 11]","Several reviews have already described the plot and details behind the making of this film, so I won't repeat that.  I did want to mention something that may not be as readily apparent to most American viewers but that seems important for an appreciation of this film.One reader compared this film to the realism of ""Pather Panchali"" and I agree with another that the similarities between these films are superficial: the ""auntie"" character in both films are similar, they both work by focusing on the lives of a few set against the backdrop of major changes in India that affect their lives.  Where the films differ is that in Pather Panchali, Satyaajit Ray was attempting (and was remarkably successful) to bring to his own country a style of poetic realism he learned from European directors and most notably from Renoir.  In this film, Deepa Mehta appears to be attempting to adapt mainstream Bollywood style to the problem of conveying realistically the problems inherited from a rigid interpretation of religious traditions.  In this she is also remarkably successful.  Some have complained in these reviews of a melodramatic and emotionally charged feel to the film -- but what is missed is that this style is characteristic of mainstream ""Bollywood"" filmmaking, and the director has been able to adapt this style to her own purposes, which suggests that her primary intended audience is in India.  What I found most interesting was the way she adapted the traditional musical numbers in Bollywood films, including them while making them much more plausible than in the standard Bollywood musicals.  In such films, emotions of the characters are expressed through highly stylized musical sequences, in which the main characters dance and sing to express their love for one another or jealousy or fear or sorrow.  In this film, the numbers were toned down, and the emotion was carried by the song, while the characters adopted poses or activities that suggested their emotional state without explicitly bursting into song.""Water"" is beautifully shot with a very effective cast.  At great odds and against the backdrop of persecution and opposition by fundamentalists, the film successfully brings attention to the traditional (and to some extent still continuing) plight of widows in India.  Moreover, it effectively employs a style of filmmaking that would both be accessible to non-Indian viewers and that at the same time respects and honors the great tradition of mainstream Indian filmmaking.

It didn't take long before I got drawn into the story and, especially, the characters.  The picture takes place in 1938 India and Ghandi was a sort of supporting role in formulating the plot.  We start the movie by witnessing a young girl (we're talking somewhere around 7-9 years old) finding out she's a widow.  We then find out that widows in the Indian culture are doomed to live their live in a sort of impoverished pennance while being banned from remarriage.  Our young girl is condemned to a sort of halfway house for widows.  Some of the widows have been that way since the age of our heroine only now they are middle-aged.  They have to fend for themselves which involves begging and more intimate pursuits.  Our girl refuses to accept things the way they are and it is her agitation that creates a new attitude in the ranks of her elders.  There are many facets of this theme played out in ""Water"" utilizing the many unique characters in the story.  In the end, we are left with a modern-day perspective of a problem I (and, I suspect, most viewers) were innocently ignorant of.This is a quality film which impressed me on virtually all levels.

Although based in the distant past (1938) when Ghandi was rising to power in his peaceful resistance to the British occupation there, film concludes in its postscriipt that in present times, there are almost 32 million widows in India today living under similar circumstances. Film is focused on the young 7-year old girl who arrives to ashram when her husband passes away.  Since she was promised to him since her birth, regardless of the fact that their marriage was not consummated, she is banished forever from her own and her husband's family into an ashram where other widows reside.  These women of all ages and social classes coexist together trying to find purpose in their new envirinment. When they are not cooking, cleaning or mending, they are praying or begging on the streets in order to pay the rent for their lodgings. Their income is meager and in most cases they obtain their food from  money paid for services from Brahmins who get young widows procured to them in secret of the night.  There is an underlying message here about the society of women who are promised into marriage at birth and have no change of ever learning how to read or obtain a trade that would allow the to earn decent living if there husband is no longer around to provide for them.  They are deprived of ever having family, or remarriage.  The customs say that woman can be cremated at the time of her husband death (burnt alove), sent to ashram for the rest of her life to live in penitence that will honor her departed husband, or with permission of the family marry her husband's younger brother.  The traditional laws seem to overrule social laws created by the forward thinking progressive intellectuals.  Forced protitution, pedofilia and general expoitation of these women is completely hearbreaking.  Their only way out of it is death - natural or suicide - or miracle of any man wanting to marry them if they are still young and pretty enough.

Director Deepa Mehta's story has the lushly romantic impulses of her earlier film, ""Earth"" (about young lovers caught in the bloody Pakistani-India partition), while it has its own moral and political message to relate in the face of injustice and unreason, a message emphasized by the uplifting appearance of an idealized Gandhi in the closing scene.Editorial reviews above cover the plot of the film quite nicely, so there's no need to repeat it here. In addition to its heart-rending story, viewers will find much to appreciate, from the richly varied musical score and often striking cinematography, to the performances of its lead actors: especially Seema Biswas, as the young widow who defies tradition, and the star-crossed young lovers played by Lisa Ray and John Abraham.

964855,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000E112BG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[11, 12]","When I was in film school, I remember a professor showing an Indian film called ""Panther Panchali"". Despite the terrible print, I could see director Satyajit Ray was an artist. ""Panchali"" is a beautiful film about a poor Indian family living through the monsoon season. I then went on to discover some of his other films. A couple of years ago, Merchant Ivory hosted a retrospective of Ray's films and these restored prints are available on DVD. You are depriving yourself if you do not watch these films.As I watched ""Water"", the new film from director Deepa Mehta, I was constantly reminded of Ray's films. The composition, pacing, subject matter and acting style are all the same.Chuyia (Ronica Sajnani Sarala), a seven year old girl, finds she has become a widow; her arranged husband has died leaving her adrift in a society that favors men. Religious law dictates if she lives a chaste life she will join her husband in heaven. Of course, she doesn't know or understand any of this when her family takes her to a home, to live with other widows. She soon meets the matriarch of the house, Sadananda (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), a fat woman who eats the most food, Shakuntala (Seema Biswas), a bitter woman who shows some compassion to Chuyia and Kalyani (Lisa Ray), a young woman who is allowed to grow her hair out and meet `clients' to help support the house. Soon, Chuyia meets Narayana (John Abraham), a bachelor from a rich family who is instantly attracted to Kalyani. As their relationship grows, there are murmurs of Gandhi leading the Indian people to independence from Britain.Deepa Mehta has crafted a beautiful film depicting a sad reality in India's history. As one character states, families used this religious practice to free themselves of a financial burden and another mouth to feed. In this belief, there are three ways of dealing with a widow; marry her to a younger brother of the deceased male, have her join her husband on the funeral pyre, or banish her to a house to live with other widows until she dies and rejoins her husband in Heaven. Of course, if a wife dies, the husband is free, encouraged to remarry. After Mehta establishes the details of this practice, she introduces us to the main characters, the people who will inhabit the story we are about to watch. There are people from every generation in this house; ""Auntie"" is an elderly widow who still dreams of the sweets she had at her wedding, when she was seven, Sadananda seems to be a gang leader, or pimp, sending Kalyani out to meet married men, to help support the house and her eating habits. Sadly, every generation is represented.The growing relationship between Kalyani and Narayana is very believable and touching. Indian tradition and the difficulties of Kalyani's position dictate they must behave in a certain way. But Narayana is a modern Indian man and he soon tells his mother he and Kalyani will be married. When his mother finds out his intended bride is a widow, she is shocked and won't allow it. But Narayana has no doubt that he will wed his lover, all it takes is some convincing.As the story moves towards its emotional climax, Shakuntala becomes the voice of reason. She helps Kalyani get out of the house to meet her lover and eventually helps other members of the house.Mehta composes every shot with a painter's eye. Vivid colors poke out throughout every frame, colors so bright they appear to be painted on the screen. As we watch these characters struggle to live in the house, they make infrequent trips outside to bathe, walk, and experience. Inside the house, everyone wears a sari made of the same natural cloth and everything is rather drab. But as they explore the neighboring community, we see women wearing bright saris, vivid flowers and bright gold, copper and silver. The difference between the two worlds is very noticeable and helps to contrast the living conditions of the two different groups.Ray used the same attention to detail in his films creating beautiful compositions in black and white.Both filmmakers chose similar subject matter. Like Ray before her, Mehta has chosen a fairly simple, straight forward story. Because the story doesn't have a lot of distractions, it allows you to concentrate on the characters and give them your attention. The actors provide vivid, interesting portrayals that compliment the story.""Water"" is a very good film.

964857,A39Z2M0O2K3XY2,B000E112BG,Warlen Bassham,"[1, 3]","-----A Great Movie with Flaws.No motion picture is ever perfect, I suppose, though some come awfully close.  This one doesn't come all that close, but it has great impact and deserves it's high-flying reputation.To get the low points out of the way quickly: 1. The movie is too 'preachy,' and that sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling.  2. The story-telling style is inconsistent, sometimes giving the plot to us in a sort of mental slow motion with numbing amounts of detail, and at other times, jumping ahead, or into and out of fantasy, with almost no clues at all to things we are evidently supposed to guess at.  3. The little girl who plays the role of catalyst in this story of cultural challenge and change is much too aware of the camera.  She's cute, and at times very effective, but you can almost hear the director telling her what to do, how to look, which way to turn, how to utter the phrase, when to cry, when to laugh.  She seldom manages to seem 'natural.'  4. The lead adult female role is seriously miscast.  Lisa Ray doesn't look at all Indian, she's far too beautiful to be believable in this setting, and her portrayal of her character is disappointingly shallow.  5. One plot point involving a necessary 'coincidence' in particular stretches believability to the breaking point.BUT . . .But in spite of those flaws, I give this movie and its DVD the full 5 stars.  [Four and a half, in my mind, but I rounded up.]A seven-year-old widow [not eight as some reviews and interviews have suggested] is exiled to life in an Ashram-- a sort of halfway house for the legally dead.  As is explained in the movie itself, a widow in 1938 India has three choices: (a) she can throw herself onto her husband's funeral pyre, (b) she can marry his younger brother, if there is one, and if he wishes it, (c) she can live the rest of her life dressed in the solid white of death shrouds, with no color in her life, one meal a day, and no chance, ever, to be a functioning part of her society.Except that his particular ashram has a director, herself a widow, who has capitalized on the extreme beauty of one of her inmates-- a young woman who was widowed at age 9 and who is now rented out as a sort of Call Girl of Death for the sexual entertainment of wealthy middle-aged 'clients.'  And this young woman meets a handsome young man about her age, and . . . well, you can guess the rest.And thereby hangs the plot.  I will not give away anything other than to say that this movie is a tragedy, but it is not at all predictable, and with the one major exception already mentioned seems entirely believable.So far so good, but there are some 'extras' that lift this film above the commonplace and bring it close to being a masterpiece.  I'll list these elements.First, and perhaps most importantly, the cinematography is breathtaking.  Remember 'Picnic'?  This one goes the night scenes in that earlier movie one better.  That one had electric lightbulbs inside paper lanterns.  This one has several night scenes in which the only lighting is indirect, and even then is provided by candles, and they are magical!  The daylight scenes are just as lovingly photographed, and the title element is exploited wonderfully.Second, the inclusion of Ghandi himself [first via voice recordings, then in person] in the plot line is a stroke of genius.  Doing so shows how traditional patriarchal Hindu culture, very much alive still today, had even then already begun to abandon one of its hero's prime points of philosophy.Third, the musical score by one of my all-time favorites, Mychael Danna, is evocative without being slavishly true to the subject matter and setting.  The flute tune during the opening titles, although a bit too Western in harmonic usage, grows over the course of the movie to provide powerfully moving musical undercurrents to the story, done as only Danna can do it.  [Remember 'The Sweet Hereafter'?]Fourth, the use of almost violent color in one fantasy scene comes as a powerful reminder of the deprivation (of so many kinds) that these poor widows are forced to live in, if you can call it living.I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  This movie will live with me for a long, long time.  The flaws bring it down below the level of ultimate greatness, but the total impact the movie has ensures that it is powerful, moving, and memorable.",5,Thrilling and Disturbing Near-Masterpiece,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,4379,"['-A', 'Great', 'Movie', 'Flaws.No', 'motion', 'picture', 'ever', 'perfect', 'suppose', 'come', 'awfully', 'close', 'one', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'great', 'impact', 'high-flying', 'reputation.To', 'get', 'low', 'points', 'way', 'quickly', '1', 'movie', 'too', ""'preachy"", 'sometimes', 'way', 'story-telling', '2', 'story-telling', 'style', 'inconsistent', 'sometimes', 'giving', 'plot', 'sort', 'mental', 'slow', 'motion', 'numbing', 'amounts', 'detail', 'other', 'times', 'jumping', 'ahead', 'fantasy', 'almost', 'clues', 'things', 'are', 'evidently', 'supposed', 'guess', '3', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'role', 'catalyst', 'story', 'cultural', 'challenge', 'change', 'much', 'too', 'aware', 'camera', 'cute', 'times', 'very', 'effective', 'can', 'almost', 'hear', 'director', 'telling', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'look', 'way', 'turn', 'how', 'utter', 'phrase', 'when', 'cry', 'when', 'laugh', 'seldom', 'manages', 'seem', ""'natural"", '4', 'lead', 'adult', 'female', 'role', 'seriously', 'miscast', 'Lisa', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'look', 'Indian', 'far', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'believable', 'setting', 'portrayal', 'character', 'disappointingly', 'shallow', '5', 'One', 'plot', 'point', 'involving', 'necessary', ""'coincidence"", 'particular', 'stretches', 'believability', 'breaking', 'point.BUT', '.But', 'spite', 'flaws', 'give', 'movie', 'DVD', 'full', '5', 'stars', '[', 'Four', 'half', 'mind', 'rounded', 'up', ']', 'seven-year-old', 'widow', '[', 'not', 'eight', 'reviews', 'interviews', 'have', 'suggested', ']', 'exiled', 'life', 'Ashram', 'sort', 'halfway', 'house', 'legally', 'dead', 'explained', 'movie', 'widow', '1938', 'India', 'three', 'choices', 'can', 'throw', 'husband', 'funeral', 'pyre', 'b', 'can', 'marry', 'younger', 'brother', 'one', 'c', 'can', 'live', 'rest', 'life', 'dressed', 'solid', 'white', 'death', 'shrouds', 'color', 'life', 'one', 'meal', 'day', 'chance', 'ever', 'be', 'functioning', 'part', 'society.Except', 'particular', 'ashram', 'director', 'widow', 'who', 'capitalized', 'extreme', 'beauty', 'one', 'inmates', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'widowed', 'age', '9', 'who', 'now', 'rented', 'out', 'sort', 'Call', 'Girl', 'Death', 'sexual', 'entertainment', 'wealthy', 'middle-aged', ""'clients"", 'young', 'woman', 'handsome', 'young', 'man', 'age', 'well', 'can', 'guess', 'rest.And', 'thereby', 'plot', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'anything', 'other', 'say', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'not', 'predictable', 'one', 'major', 'exception', 'already', 'mentioned', 'entirely', 'believable.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'are', ""'extras"", 'film', 'commonplace', 'bring', 'close', 'being', 'masterpiece', ""'ll"", 'list', 'elements.First', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'Remember', 'one', 'night', 'scenes', 'earlier', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'one', 'had', 'electric', 'lightbulbs', 'paper', 'lanterns', 'one', 'several', 'night', 'scenes', 'only', 'lighting', 'indirect', 'even', 'then', 'provided', 'candles', 'are', 'magical', 'daylight', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'lovingly', 'photographed', 'title', 'element', 'exploited', 'wonderfully.Second', 'inclusion', 'Ghandi', '[', 'first', 'voice', 'recordings', 'then', 'person', ']', 'plot', 'line', 'stroke', 'genius', 'Doing', 'so', 'how', 'traditional', 'patriarchal', 'Hindu', 'culture', 'very', 'much', 'alive', 'still', 'today', 'had', 'even', 'then', 'already', 'begun', 'abandon', 'one', 'hero', 'prime', 'points', 'philosophy.Third', 'musical', 'score', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'Mychael', 'Danna', 'evocative', 'being', 'slavishly', 'true', 'subject', 'matter', 'setting', 'flute', 'tune', 'opening', 'titles', 'bit', 'too', 'Western', 'harmonic', 'usage', 'course', 'movie', 'provide', 'powerfully', 'moving', 'musical', 'undercurrents', 'story', 'done', 'only', 'Danna', 'can', 'do', '[', 'Remember', ""'The"", 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', ']', 'Fourth', 'use', 'almost', 'violent', 'color', 'one', 'fantasy', 'scene', 'powerful', 'reminder', 'deprivation', 'so', 'many', 'kinds', 'poor', 'widows', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'can', 'call', 'living.I', 'could', 'go', 'get', 'idea', 'movie', 'will', 'live', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'flaws', 'bring', 'down', 'level', 'ultimate', 'greatness', 'total', 'impact', 'movie', 'powerful', 'moving', 'memorable']",Water

964859,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000E112BG,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[9, 12]","Water is a moving story centered around the sad plight of widows in India (and although the film is set in the 1930s, it is mentioned at the end that millions of widows in India still live in this same fashion). A young Indian girl is widowed at the age of eight and moved to the house of widows to mourn for her husband's death the rest of her life. But this young girl begins to question the reasons for this mourning, creating quite a stir in the fundamentalist Hindu women.Although the cinematography is beautiful, the story moving, and the story of the film's creation a story of perseverance in itself, Water is lacking something to really move the plot along. It's just a rather slow film. If you're a very patient viewer who exults in slowly developed characters (don't confuse that for slowly developing character arcs, because unfortunately the characters are rather two dimensional), then you will likely enjoy this film, otherwise I think viewers will find themselves getting a bit bored.Not that the topic of the film is at all boring, in fact, it's wonderful to see such a socially conscious film being made, and watching the behind the scenes featurette and ""the making of"" featurette on the DVD really shows you how violently fundamentalist Hindus reacted to the production of this film. The production was delayed five years, completely recast, and moved from India to Sri Lanka. It's amazing that Deepa Mehta got this film made, and you can tell from the interviews on the DVD and from the film itself that it has a very special place in her heart.Obviously, it is a very highly regarded movie since it was nominated for Best Foreign Film, but it may be the back story of how the film got made that deserves the Oscar rather than the film itself. I'm not trying to be harsh. I appreciate what the filmmaker was trying to do. I just didn't find myself engrossed in the story.",3,"Deeply moving film, but the moving is very slow",1170892800,"02 8, 2007",2007,1892,"['Water', 'moving', 'story', 'centered', 'sad', 'plight', 'widows', 'India', 'film', 'set', '1930s', 'mentioned', 'end', 'millions', 'widows', 'India', 'still', 'live', 'same', 'fashion', 'young', 'Indian', 'girl', 'widowed', 'age', 'eight', 'moved', 'house', 'widows', 'mourn', 'husband', 'death', 'rest', 'life', 'young', 'girl', 'question', 'reasons', 'mourning', 'creating', 'quite', 'stir', 'fundamentalist', 'Hindu', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'story', 'moving', 'story', 'film', 'creation', 'story', 'perseverance', 'Water', 'lacking', 'something', 'really', 'move', 'plot', 'just', 'rather', 'slow', 'film', ""'re"", 'very', 'patient', 'viewer', 'who', 'slowly', 'developed', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'slowly', 'developing', 'character', 'arcs', 'unfortunately', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'two', 'dimensional', 'then', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'otherwise', 'think', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'getting', 'bit', 'bored.Not', 'topic', 'film', 'boring', 'fact', 'wonderful', 'see', 'such', 'socially', 'conscious', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'watching', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'making', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'really', 'how', 'violently', 'fundamentalist', 'Hindus', 'reacted', 'production', 'film', 'production', 'was', 'delayed', 'five', 'years', 'completely', 'recast', 'moved', 'India', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'amazing', 'Deepa', 'Mehta', 'got', 'film', 'made', 'can', 'tell', 'interviews', 'DVD', 'film', 'very', 'special', 'place', 'heart.Obviously', 'very', 'highly', 'regarded', 'movie', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'may', 'be', 'back', 'story', 'how', 'film', 'got', 'made', 'Oscar', 'rather', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'harsh', 'appreciate', 'what', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'engrossed', 'story']",Water
964860,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000E112BG,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","Deepa Mehta's ""Water"" is the final part of a trilogy of movies [the other two being ""Fire"" and ""Earth""]. All three explore certain facets of Indian culture and are excellent social commentaries.In ""Water"", the film is set during the time of British Colonial rule of India, known as the British Raj. The year is 1938, and despite British rule, there is a prevalence of child marriages. Many young girls are married off to much older men, and one such unfortunate is Chuyia [Sarala Kariyawasam]. She is an eight-year-old who has just been widowed and as per the custom of the time, is packed off to a widow's ashram to spend her life expiating her 'sins'. The other motivations for consigning the widows to ashrams is to offset their families' financial responsibilities and also alleviate the social stigma of having a widow in the family [ widows are frequently seen a symbols of bad luck, a perception that has lifted somewhat in contemporary Indian society but not altogether dispelled].The presiding authority over the ashram is Madhumati {Manorama] an obese and completely ruthless lady who rules over the ashram with the aid of a pimp, Gulabi [Raghuvir yadav],and a eunuch. In order to keep the ashram functioning [apparently donations are insufficient] and Madhumati well-fed, the old witch prostitutes one of the ashram's residents, young widow Kalyani [an ethereally beautiful Lisa Ray]. Because of Kalyani's economic importance, she is the only one of the widows who is allowed to keep her hair [all the others, including young Chuyia have their heads shorn]. Then there is the literate widow [not many of the women can read] Shakuntala [portrayed by the talented Seema Biswas] who is battling her own inner demons.Shakuntala finds it hard to reconcile her devout Hindu beliefs with the fact that she abhors being a widow. Young Chuyia on the other hand, keeps thinking that she will be eventually taken away from the ashram by her mother, having no clue as to how dire her situation really is.The story gets moving with the introduction of another character, Narayan  [John Abraham], a staunch follower of Mahatma Gandhi, and who comes from an affluent and influential family. When Narayan and Kalyani meet, sparks fly but both are very much aware of social taboos which hold them back from each other.Kalyani begins to refuse servicing clients, inciting Madhumati's anger. Narayan finds a way to meet Kalyani and the pair make plans to get away, a secret that Kalyani divulges to Chuyia. The young child accidentally blurts out the secret to Madhumati and this sets the stage for a series of tragic events.Beautifully filmed, the story serves as a powerful social commentary on the plight of widows in India as set during the late 1930s. Though widows are much better off in contemporary India, their situation is still dire, with lives spent in poverty and under oppression, primarily in the rural areas. With ""Water"", director Mehta has given us a remarkably human story of substance that lingers in one's consciousness long after the credits have rolled.",5,Insightful social commentary & thoroughly absorbing,1245196800,"06 17, 2009",2009,3068,"['Deepa', 'Mehta', 'Water', 'final', 'part', 'trilogy', 'movies', '[', 'other', 'two', 'being', 'Fire', 'Earth', ']', 'three', 'explore', 'certain', 'facets', 'Indian', 'culture', 'are', 'excellent', 'social', 'commentaries.In', 'Water', 'film', 'set', 'time', 'British', 'Colonial', 'rule', 'India', 'known', 'British', 'Raj', 'year', '1938', 'British', 'rule', 'prevalence', 'child', 'marriages', 'Many', 'young', 'girls', 'are', 'married', 'much', 'older', 'men', 'one', 'such', 'unfortunate', 'Chuyia', '[', 'Sarala', 'Kariyawasam', ']', 'eight-year-old', 'who', 'just', 'been', 'widowed', 'custom', 'time', 'packed', 'off', 'widow', 'ashram', 'spend', 'life', 'expiating', ""'sins"", 'other', 'motivations', 'consigning', 'widows', 'ashrams', 'offset', 'families', 'financial', 'responsibilities', 'also', 'alleviate', 'social', 'stigma', 'having', 'widow', 'family', '[', 'widows', 'are', 'frequently', 'seen', 'symbols', 'bad', 'luck', 'perception', 'lifted', 'somewhat', 'contemporary', 'Indian', 'society', 'not', 'altogether', 'dispelled', ']', '.The', 'presiding', 'authority', 'ashram', 'Madhumati', 'Manorama', ']', 'obese', 'completely', 'ruthless', 'lady', 'who', 'rules', 'ashram', 'aid', 'pimp', 'Gulabi', '[', 'Raghuvir', 'yadav', ']', 'eunuch', 'order', 'keep', 'ashram', 'functioning', '[', 'apparently', 'donations', 'are', 'insufficient', ']', 'Madhumati', 'well-fed', 'old', 'witch', 'one', 'ashram', 'residents', 'young', 'widow', 'Kalyani', '[', 'ethereally', 'beautiful', 'Lisa', 'Ray', ']', 'Kalyani', 'economic', 'importance', 'only', 'one', 'widows', 'who', 'allowed', 'keep', 'hair', 'others', 'including', 'young', 'Chuyia', 'have', 'heads', 'shorn', ']', 'Then', 'literate', 'widow', '[', 'not', 'many', 'women', 'can', 'read', ']', 'Shakuntala', '[', 'portrayed', 'talented', 'Seema', 'Biswas', ']', 'who', 'battling', 'own', 'inner', 'demons.Shakuntala', 'hard', 'reconcile', 'devout', 'Hindu', 'beliefs', 'fact', 'being', 'widow', 'Young', 'Chuyia', 'other', 'hand', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'eventually', 'taken', 'away', 'ashram', 'mother', 'having', 'clue', 'how', 'dire', 'situation', 'really', 'is.The', 'story', 'moving', 'introduction', 'character', 'Narayan', '[', 'John', 'Abraham', ']', 'staunch', 'follower', 'Mahatma', 'Gandhi', 'who', 'affluent', 'influential', 'family', 'When', 'Narayan', 'Kalyani', 'meet', 'fly', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'aware', 'social', 'taboos', 'hold', 'back', 'other.Kalyani', 'refuse', 'servicing', 'clients', 'inciting', 'Madhumati', 'anger', 'Narayan', 'way', 'meet', 'Kalyani', 'pair', 'make', 'plans', 'get', 'away', 'secret', 'Kalyani', 'Chuyia', 'young', 'child', 'accidentally', 'out', 'secret', 'Madhumati', 'stage', 'series', 'tragic', 'events.Beautifully', 'filmed', 'story', 'powerful', 'social', 'commentary', 'plight', 'widows', 'India', 'set', 'late', '1930s', 'widows', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'off', 'contemporary', 'India', 'situation', 'still', 'dire', 'lives', 'spent', 'poverty', 'oppression', 'primarily', 'rural', 'areas', 'Water', 'director', 'Mehta', 'given', 'remarkably', 'human', 'story', 'substance', 'one', 'consciousness', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'rolled']",Water
