1423475,A2RVCF21L2NPU5,B004P9FAKC,"Cherise Kachelmuss ""Mom and More""","[25, 27]","My boys love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and this new DVD set ""Mickey Mouse Clubhouse:  Mickey's Great Outdoors"" is perfect to get them ready for summer.  It includes five episodes (one of which has never been on tv) that all involve playing outside!  The set includes the regular DVD, a Digital DVD to put the episodes on you computer or portable device (iPod etc...), and the Mickey Mote.  The Mickey Mote is a kid-sized red Mickey Mouse shaped remote with four colored buttons.  Setting it up is easy as you just aim your regular DVD remote at the Mickey Mote and push the buttons to correspond.  You can then watch the episodes in regular mode or Discovery Mode where your child can interact to answer questions.I tried setting up the Mickey Mote with my two DVD players but couldn't get all the buttons to work, so we ended up using our regular DVD remote (you use the Up, Down, Left, and Right buttons only.)  My son would answer the questions and I'd push the button he told me.  It is a great way to break up tv watching and get kids involved and I am sure with some extra trying I can get the Mickey Mote set up but my boys would not let it go!  So while the Mickey Mote is a great idea, you can use your regular DVD remote or there is a Auto Play mode which allows the questions to pop up and answer without using a remote.  I will say the episodes had a good amount of questions and they were easy enough in Level 1 (there are two levels) for my 4 year old to answer.  He was very excited as he thought it was a game! .Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion.",4,Cute DVD set!,1306713600,"05 30, 2011",2011,1614,"['boys', 'love', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'new', 'DVD', 'set', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'Clubhouse', 'Mickey', 'Great', 'Outdoors', 'perfect', 'get', 'ready', 'summer', 'five', 'episodes', 'one', 'never', 'been', 'tv', 'involve', 'playing', 'set', 'regular', 'DVD', 'Digital', 'DVD', 'put', 'episodes', 'computer', 'portable', 'device', 'iPod', 'etc', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'kid-sized', 'red', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'shaped', 'remote', 'four', 'colored', 'buttons', 'Setting', 'up', 'easy', 'just', 'aim', 'regular', 'DVD', 'remote', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'push', 'buttons', 'correspond', 'can', 'then', 'watch', 'episodes', 'regular', 'mode', 'Discovery', 'Mode', 'where', 'child', 'can', 'interact', 'answer', 'questions.I', 'tried', 'setting', 'up', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'two', 'DVD', 'players', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'buttons', 'work', 'ended', 'up', 'using', 'regular', 'DVD', 'remote', 'use', 'Up', 'Down', 'Left', 'Right', 'buttons', 'only', 'son', 'would', 'answer', 'questions', ""'d"", 'push', 'button', 'told', 'great', 'way', 'break', 'up', 'tv', 'watching', 'get', 'kids', 'involved', 'am', 'sure', 'extra', 'trying', 'can', 'get', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'set', 'up', 'boys', 'would', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'So', 'Mickey', 'Mote', 'great', 'idea', 'can', 'use', 'regular', 'DVD', 'remote', 'Auto', 'Play', 'mode', 'questions', 'pop', 'up', 'answer', 'using', 'remote', 'will', 'say', 'episodes', 'had', 'good', 'amount', 'questions', 'were', 'easy', 'enough', 'Level', '1', 'are', 'two', 'levels', '4', 'year', 'old', 'answer', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'thought', 'was', 'game', '.Mom', 'More', 'Disclosure', 'was', 'sent', 'DVD', 'review', 'exchange', 'honest', 'opinion']",N/A
