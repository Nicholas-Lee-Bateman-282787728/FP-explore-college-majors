Sacha Baron Cohen deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Rowan Atkinson in terms of comic brilliance. The simple fact is that the least interesting character of the three he does is Ali G. A little bit of him goes a long away, but he's absolutely wonderful in many of these interviews such as the ones with Ghali, Baker, Coop, and Aldrin. The white pseudo-gangsta is an interesting concept, and the fact that he's British confuses many an interviewee. That the likes of Newt Gingrich are so accepting of him speaks volumes of our cultural decline. Based on past experience, they are not surprised to discover that the journalist in front of them happens to be a yo-yo. They probably find him non-remarkable. I love Borat's contribution to this series (as does everybody else I'm sure). His Guide to the USA is every bit as good as the material in the movie itself. There's even a rodeo segment here; although honestly, I found Bruno to have the best shtick of them all. The guy is hysterical and I am looking forward to seeing Cohen's movie--that will be soon be released--about him. Bruno is a gag a minute and a major improvement on Dieter from SNL. Oh, he won't be loved by gay activists but that's another reason why we should cherish him. All of the skits here possess varying degrees of political incorrectness and that's why they're so welcome and excellent. This one would be great to own.",5,Respect.,1182038400,"06 17, 2007",2007,1529,"[""'m"", 'late', 'arriver', 'Ali', 'G', 'phenomenon', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'DVDs', 'here', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'film', 'Borat', 'Sacha', 'Baron', 'Cohen', 'be', 'mentioned', 'same', 'sentence', 'Rowan', 'Atkinson', 'terms', 'comic', 'brilliance', 'simple', 'fact', 'least', 'interesting', 'character', 'three', 'Ali', 'G.', 'A', 'little', 'bit', 'long', 'away', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'many', 'interviews', 'such', 'ones', 'Ghali', 'Baker', 'Coop', 'Aldrin', 'white', 'pseudo-gangsta', 'interesting', 'concept', 'fact', 'British', 'confuses', 'many', 'interviewee', 'likes', 'Newt', 'Gingrich', 'are', 'so', 'accepting', 'volumes', 'cultural', 'decline', 'Based', 'past', 'experience', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'discover', 'journalist', 'front', 'be', 'yo-yo', 'probably', 'find', 'non-remarkable', 'love', 'Borat', 'contribution', 'series', 'everybody', 'else', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Guide', 'USA', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'material', 'movie', 'even', 'rodeo', 'segment', 'here', 'honestly', 'found', 'Bruno', 'have', 'best', 'shtick', 'guy', 'hysterical', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Cohen', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'be', 'released', 'Bruno', 'gag', 'minute', 'major', 'improvement', 'Dieter', 'SNL', 'Oh', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'loved', 'gay', 'activists', 'reason', 'why', 'should', 'cherish', 'skits', 'here', 'possess', 'varying', 'degrees', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'why', ""'re"", 'so', 'welcome', 'excellent', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'own']",Da Ali G Show - The Complete Seasons 1 & 2

If you missed Da Ali G Show when it first aired or if you want to relive the comedy then this DVD is right for you.I hate when people say Ali G is offensive and racist when in fact he is just basically poking fun at himself. Sacha Baron Cohen is Jewish and most of his humor is just stupid fun. There are several appearances by politicians who try to survive Ali's odd and idiotic line of questioning. Then there's Borat the anti-Semitic person from Kazakhstan. Finally there's Bruno the Austrian fashion guru who attempts to makes other uncomfortable by acting as homosexual as possible.
