He uses lots of neat gadgets and vehicles. Perfect gift for a child (ages 7 and up I would say). Even adults will enjoy watching with kids. This is a wonderful cartoon DVD set.

994914,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B000FS9MUQ,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[8, 11]","After Disney revived afternoon 'toon TV with Ducktales, there quickly followed a host of great shows featuring revamped Disney characters. These included Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers, TaleSpin and this witty, thoughtful, excellently-written series.Launchpad McQuack carried over from DuckTales, and amazingly, when you thought that show had used up every duck-related joke possible, Darkwing Duck unleashed a fury of malapropisms and wacky slogans. But DD was a flawed human, or rather mallard, and long before the retooled Batman he was a conflicted crime fighter. Add in his inability to understand Gosalyn and the wild card of Launchpad, and you have a cartoon departure from the standard superhero formula that fans absolutely loved while for other viewers the show fell flat.That would lead to Disney's taking animation risks in its TV shorts that would lift afternoon 'toons to a higher level of interest and complexity. The high point in experimenting was probably Raw Toonage, which launched both Marsupilami (from a Belgian comic) and Here's Bonkers, loosely based on Roger Rabbit. The overwhelming response probably enabled Disney Channel (and Toon Disney) to nearly reinvent the cartoon as an artform with Kim Possible, deviate from cookie cutter formulas with such 'toons as Lloyd in Space and Teacher's Pet, and return to the fast, frenzied, funny 'toon in Brandy and Mr. Whiskers.Disney's attempt to translate feature animation to TV series brilliantly succeeded. But the great art and writing all began here in the tales of Duckburg and St. Canard, and ""the terror that flaps by night"".",5,I am the terror that flaps in the night,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,1603,"['Disney', 'revived', 'afternoon', 'TV', 'Ducktales', 'quickly', 'followed', 'host', 'great', 'shows', 'featuring', 'revamped', 'Disney', 'characters', 'included', 'Chip', 'Dale', 'Rescue', 'Rangers', 'TaleSpin', 'witty', 'thoughtful', 'excellently-written', 'series.Launchpad', 'McQuack', 'carried', 'DuckTales', 'amazingly', 'when', 'thought', 'show', 'had', 'used', 'up', 'duck-related', 'joke', 'possible', 'Darkwing', 'Duck', 'unleashed', 'fury', 'malapropisms', 'wacky', 'slogans', 'DD', 'was', 'flawed', 'human', 'rather', 'mallard', 'long', 'retooled', 'Batman', 'was', 'conflicted', 'crime', 'fighter', 'Add', 'inability', 'understand', 'Gosalyn', 'wild', 'card', 'Launchpad', 'have', 'cartoon', 'departure', 'standard', 'superhero', 'formula', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'other', 'viewers', 'show', 'fell', 'flat.That', 'would', 'lead', 'Disney', 'taking', 'animation', 'risks', 'TV', 'shorts', 'would', 'lift', 'afternoon', ""'toons"", 'higher', 'level', 'interest', 'complexity', 'high', 'point', 'experimenting', 'was', 'probably', 'Raw', 'Toonage', 'launched', 'Marsupilami', 'Belgian', 'comic', 'Here', 'Bonkers', 'loosely', 'based', 'Roger', 'Rabbit', 'overwhelming', 'response', 'probably', 'enabled', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'Toon', 'Disney', 'nearly', 'reinvent', 'cartoon', 'artform', 'Kim', 'Possible', 'deviate', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'formulas', 'such', ""'toons"", 'Lloyd', 'Space', 'Teacher', 'Pet', 'return', 'fast', 'frenzied', 'funny', ""'toon"", 'Brandy', 'Mr.', 'Whiskers.Disney', 'attempt', 'translate', 'feature', 'animation', 'TV', 'series', 'brilliantly', 'succeeded', 'great', 'art', 'writing', 'began', 'here', 'tales', 'Duckburg', 'St.', 'Canard', 'terror', 'flaps', 'night']",DARKWING DUCK

994916,A319SKSB556033,B000FS9MUQ,"Inspector Gadget ""Go Go Gadget Reviews""","[3, 3]","Of all the Disney franchises my favorite has to be Duck Tales. Many people think that Duck Tales was merely an 80s TV show and never went further than Saturday morning but in reality it has a very rich history going back decades and if you think that it spoofs Indiana Jones you'd be wrong because it's actually the other way around.Darkwing Duck was a spin-off of Duck Tales, taking place in the same universe but transplanting the action from Duckburg to St. Canard. The only regular returning character was bumbling pilot Launchpad McQuack but he was my favorite, though Gizmoduck does make a couple of appearances.Darkwing himself, ordinary Drake Mallard by day, is a sort of cross between Batman, The Scarlet Pimpernel and The Shadow. He's a crime-fighter with absolutely no abilities other than his determination to beat the bad guys though his is utterly confident in himself and craves media attention. With Launchpad as his sidekick and the occasional help from his daughter Goslyn he tackles a variety of strange villains, winning usually by chance.I've often thought that a hero can only be measured by his nemesis and unfortunately none of the Darkwing Duck bad guys are up to much, but that's fine since Darkwing himself is sort of incompetent. Episodes set during the daytime contradict the noirish nature of the show and the best episodes are the ones set in the shadows and dark alleyways. I know that this is a kids show and is not necessarily in the same league as the Batman animated series but it does seem to be selling itself short in this regard. Duck Tales frequently had very dynamic and imaginative stories while Darkwing Duck is sort of hit-and-miss. That's my only complaint though.Darkwing Duck still has loads going for it, including a brilliant theme song and his memorable signature catchphrase 'Let's get dangerous' (or 'It's gonna get scary big-time' as they say in France). There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time.The DVD features a 1.33:1 full frame transfer for every episode as originally drawn with stereo sound.

Both kids and adults can get a good laugh out of this show and the humor should hold up well over the years, nothing too dated.I hear that there won't be any extras in this set, but for the chance to finally get hold of this series, I'm more than willing to forgive that. Especially when there's also supposed to be captioning, surround sound and decent artwork on the packaging.

994924,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000FS9MUQ,Mark Baker,"[15, 17]","The streets of St. Canard are filled with danger.  Villains lurk behind every corner.  But thanks to Darkwing Duck, criminals of all stripes are arrested every day.  By day, he's Drake Mallard, suburban Dad raising his adopted daughter, Gosalyn.  But by night, he's the costumed crime fighter who, assisted by his sidekick Launchpad McQuack, taking on such super villains as Bushroot, Megavolt, and Steelbeak in an effort to keep his city safe.Of course, Darkwing has his weaknesses.  He has no real super powers, but does have lots of nifty gadgets that help him fight crime.  His real problem is his ego.  He loves to make flashy entrances and is shocked each time a villain outsmarts him.  Flattery will distract him in a second.  And he even narrates his adventures - as they are happening.There is certainly plenty of danger in these episodes.  Darkwing looses his sight and must rely on the help of others to fight crime.  An evil alien lands on Earth, and Gosalyn thinks it's a pet.  Home appliances start coming to life and terrorizing the city.  Someone is knocking over banks, literally.  And the evil Quackerjack tries to convince Darkwing that he was born to serve tea, not be a crime fighter.The series is obviously a spoof on superheroes and owes much of its form to Batman.  Still, there are other comic influences here, and I'm sure someone with a better knowledge of that genre could identify them.  Between the villains and the occasional alien, there's also a strong science fiction element.  I got into the show for the humor.  Not only are there the normal cartoon hits, whacks, and smashes, but there are lots of great puns in everything from the titles to the dialog.This set includes the pilot and the first 25 regular episodes of the show aired.  Unfortunately, they aired in a different order from the order completed so all continuity is lost.  There are no extras on the set.  The picture looks good but not outstanding.  The stereo soundtrack is wonderful, however.This set will appeal to kids for the cartoon antics and adults for the puns.

The fact that Daffy Duck is currently playing the same sort of role in CN's Duck Dodgers shows athat the formula works.What irritates about this and all of the current wave of Disney animated TV DVD releases is the lack of extras. All stand up well even now (the already mentioned DuckTales and Rescue Rangers, as well as Gummi Bears and Tailspin) and are great for people of my age to relive their 'Disney Afternoons'. However, even Warners are putting minimal extras on their equivalent Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain Discs and a few featurettes on the vopice talent or animation process would be nice.The release of this show and Tailspin suggests that lesser entries such as The Wuzzles (remember them?!), Quack Pack, and Bonkers Bobcat may see DVD rebirth before long.",4,More Duck Tales...,1180483200,"05 30, 2007",2007,1380,"['days', 'Super', 'Heroes', 'overload', 'series', 'well', 'timed', 'appear', 'DVD.Less', 'famous', 'Ducktales', 'Rescue', 'Rangers', 'show', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'latter', 'sometimes', 'rivalled', 'former.Criticised', 'time', 'featuring', 'hero', 'gun', 'was', 'too-PC', ""'90s"", 'fact', 'DW', 'weapons', 'shot', 'grappling', 'hooks', 'whipped', 'cream', 'etc', 'was', 'missed', 'nay-sayers.Playing', 'Batman', 'webbed', 'feet', 'show', 'was', 'saved', 'cliche', 'obliviously', 'incompitant', 'hero', 'great', 'set', 'support', 'characters', 'not', 'least', 'was', 'DuckTales', 'own', 'Launchpad', 'McQuack', 'villians', 'fact', 'Daffy', 'Duck', 'currently', 'playing', 'same', 'sort', 'role', 'CN', 'Duck', 'Dodgers', 'formula', 'current', 'wave', 'Disney', 'animated', 'TV', 'DVD', 'lack', 'extras', 'stand', 'up', 'well', 'even', 'now', 'already', 'mentioned', 'DuckTales', 'Rescue', 'Rangers', 'as', 'well', 'Gummi', 'Bears', 'Tailspin', 'are', 'great', 'people', 'age', 'relive', ""'Disney"", 'Afternoons', 'However', 'even', 'Warners', 'are', 'putting', 'minimal', 'extras', 'equivalent', 'Animaniacs', 'Pinky', 'Brain', 'Discs', 'few', 'featurettes', 'vopice', 'talent', 'animation', 'process', 'would', 'be', 'nice.The', 'release', 'show', 'Tailspin', 'lesser', 'entries', 'such', 'Wuzzles', 'remember', 'Quack', 'Pack', 'Bonkers', 'Bobcat', 'may', 'see', 'DVD', 'rebirth', 'before', 'long']",DARKWING DUCK

For Disney and Warner Brothers, they've each tried to duke it out with the best in animation. Disney was as creative with conjuring spin-offs from their classic cartoons from Goof Troop, which included Goofy and Pete, and Tailspin which came about as a knockoff from Baloo and his days from The Jungle Book. For another cartoon, Darkwing Duck, it was one of the enjoyable cartoon series Disney had ever developed. The spinoof from Ducktales, a previous Disney series became one of the most unique cartoon shows ever, and celebreating its 15th anniversary on television. Now, the terror that flapped thorugh the night is now on home video.Darkwing Duck Volume 1, is a reflection of Drake Mallard and his universe around him, as Darkwing Duck, a super sleuth with a ego as big as his mind. The DVD set contains 25 great episodes that have made him a undergound legend. The set includes so many grat episodes from Comic Book Capers, where Darkwing rejects an idea for a comic book series about himself, and he decided to make it himself against Mega Volt, with some disaterous distractions eluding him. There is also Darkly Dawns The Duck Parts 1 & 2, the two episodes that brought him against Taurus Bulba, one of his first foes. Along the way, he meets Launchpad McQuack, a pilot from Duck Tales, who decides to tag along, and become his sidekick, and his adopted daughter Gosalyn Waddlemeier, who lost her original father early in her life. Along the way, he learns to get along with Gosalyn, and tells him asecret code to a dangerous ramrod laser. There also is Duck Blind, where Darkwing tries to adapt to being blind and his crimefighting surroundings after being injured in a terrible accident, and tries to tackle Mega Volt from stealing lights all around the city.All in all, Darkwing Duck is still one of my favorite guilty pleasure cartoon that Disney had ever developed. This is a great DVD purchase for anyone who hasn't seen these great cartoons, and for die hard Darkwing Duck fans too. I just wish there could've been more episodes that were highlighted like My Ghoulish Valentine, and Negaduck.

Hopefully today's kids will be able to watch these and like them just as much as I did back in the day.And yes, there's no bonus features and a possibly edited pilot. But again, as I've said with the Talespin set, who cares?!? If you want mind-blowing extras then go buy a regular DVD of any movie out there. And as for edited pilots, again who cares. Not many people can tell the difference when they watch it.
