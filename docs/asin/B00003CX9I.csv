521731,AAZRWLML88IZK,B00003CX9I,A kids review,"[2, 7]","Sandwiched between The Godfather and The Godfather, Part Two, The Conversation lacks the ambitious sweep of Francis Ford Coppola's mob epic, but it's a masterpiece all the same. Eerie, paranoid, and remarkably prescient, The Conversation is the story of Harry Caul, a reclusive sound surveillance expert who's been hired to eavesdrop on a young couple. Using state-of-the-art recording technology, he's able to piece together a conversation that seems to have chilling implications -- though Harry claims to care nothing about the consequences of his work. A creepy, haunting film, The Conversation now appears on Blu-ray for the first time; special features include interviews and audio commentary from Coppola, making-of docs, and the original screen tests for stars Harrison Ford and Cindy Williams.

Watching it, that slow burn, pretty much unfolds like a wave of tension and completely overtakes the viewer.  Watching Brian De Palma&#8217;s &#8216;Blow Out&#8217; it&#8217;s easy to see why he was so inspired by Coppola&#8217;s 1974 film, and those influences helped create yet another outstanding film.But who are we kidding; for this is where it&#8217;s at.&#8216;The Conversation&#8217; tells the story of Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who has his entire life uprooted thanks to a conversation he wasn&#8217;t supposed to pay attention to.  Harry is the best at what he does, and because of that he is sought after and often obtained by people in need of a real professional.  His latest job proves to be more than he can emotional handle, for it derails his private life and causes him to crawl deeper and deeper into a world of secret panic.  Alarmed by what he hears, Harry becomes concerned for the wellbeing of the couple on the tape, fearing that their lives are in danger.What makes &#8216;The Conversation&#8217; so tense is the brilliant performance from Gene Hackman.  Hackman, who happens to be one of the greatest actors of any generation, delivers his finest performance put to film here, completely crawling inside this man&#8217;s life and dissecting it from the inside out, imploding almost, as he unravels in rapid succession.  Harry&#8217;s life is so compartmentalized, everything in place and in order and completely &#8216;owned&#8217; by Caul and yet this situation, this knowledge, takes over and undoes all that he has worked so hard to control.  Watching it destroy him is remarkable.  Hackman works hand in hand with Coppola, who proved in 1974 that he was a master director.  This film is vastly different than his Oscar winning &#8216;The Godfather Part II&#8217; and yet it is nearly equally as strong and it shows such richness and depth of talent.  His ability to create such nuanced tension is enviable.With a supporting cast that only elevates the tale, and a lingering impact that only grows stronger as the memory remains, &#8216;The Conversation&#8217; is an unforgettable movie experience.",5,Chewing the tension&#8230;,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,2227,"['Few', 'films', 'are', 'as', 'unnerving', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', '8217', '8216', 'Conversation', '8217', 'Watching', 'slow', 'burn', 'pretty', 'much', 'unfolds', 'wave', 'tension', 'completely', 'viewer', 'Watching', 'Brian', 'De', 'Palma', '8217', '8216', 'Blow', 'Out', '8217', '8217', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'inspired', 'Coppola', '8217', 's', '1974', 'film', 'influences', 'helped', 'create', 'yet', 'outstanding', 'film.But', 'who', 'are', 'kidding', 'where', '8217', 'at.', '8216', 'Conversation', '8217', 'story', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'who', 'entire', 'life', 'uprooted', 'thanks', 'conversation', '8217', 't', 'supposed', 'pay', 'attention', 'Harry', 'best', 'what', 'sought', 'often', 'obtained', 'people', 'need', 'real', 'professional', 'latest', 'job', 'proves', 'be', 'more', 'can', 'emotional', 'handle', 'private', 'life', 'crawl', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'world', 'secret', 'panic', 'Alarmed', 'what', 'Harry', 'concerned', 'wellbeing', 'couple', 'tape', 'fearing', 'lives', 'are', 'danger.What', '8216', 'Conversation', '8217', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Hackman', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'generation', 'finest', 'performance', 'put', 'film', 'here', 'completely', 'crawling', 'man', '8217', 's', 'life', 'dissecting', 'inside', 'imploding', 'almost', 'rapid', 'succession', 'Harry', '8217', 's', 'life', 'so', 'compartmentalized', 'everything', 'place', 'order', 'completely', '8216', 'owned', '8217', 'Caul', 'yet', 'situation', 'knowledge', 'undoes', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'control', 'Watching', 'destroy', 'remarkable', 'Hackman', 'hand', 'hand', 'Coppola', 'who', 'proved', '1974', 'was', 'master', 'director', 'film', 'vastly', 'different', 'Oscar', 'winning', '8216', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', '8217', 'yet', 'nearly', 'equally', 'strong', 'such', 'richness', 'depth', 'talent', 'ability', 'create', 'such', 'nuanced', 'tension', 'enviable.With', 'supporting', 'cast', 'only', 'tale', 'lingering', 'impact', 'only', 'stronger', 'memory', '8216', 'Conversation', '8217', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'experience']",The Conversation

It's basically about nothing, and the story revolves around a simple conversation that probably leads to something sinister, only that I stopped caring at midway of the picture.

The film was followed by &quot;The Conversation&quot;, one of the best films of the decade. It was nominated  for the Best Picture Oscar and lost to &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;.The film stars Gene Hackman as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert from  San Francisco. One day, he records a conversation between two lovers which  ends with the crucial words: &quot;He would kill us if he could&quot;.  Since Harry Caul doesn't know the whole background of these words, he  fataly misinterpretes them. The film shows in a subtle and fascinating way  that everything small is linked with a larger whole and things depend on  each other more than we think. Another hint for that is also given during  the conversation of the couple when the man says that when the newspapers  went on strike, many homeless people died because it was too cold and they  didn't have newspapers to cover themselves at night. &quot;The  Conversation&quot; also works as a brillaint character study of a man whose  live turned into a great sadness because of his profession. When he returns  home on his birthday, Harry finds a present on the table by the owner of  his appartment, but the only thing that bothers him is how she managed to  get in there. He doesn't want anybody to know much about him, not even his  girlfriend.Everything in this picture is just perfect. Coppola's  direction and his original screenplay are both fantastic, as is Gene  Hackman in the lead. Another standout is the sound by Walter Murch.

521740,A1NFKE0TNZUGGC,B00003CX9I,"Benito Vasquez ""Benji""","[2, 2]","For all the praise Coppola garnered with ""The Godfather"", his work on ""The Conversation"", though not as romantic as his mobster classic, is even more deserved of his directorial genius. Coppola presents maximum mood and feel with minimal, even seemingly irrelevant dialogue at first listen, unless of course you know Coppola and realize every ounce of dialogue has significant meaning in the end. One will see this in the work of his daughter, Sofia, in the future (""Lost In Translation""). The timing of this movie's content and it's relevancy to Watergate is no coincidence, but its impact is temendous. Not only does the content of every second of this movie make one realize the extent of the possiblities and ramifications of Watergate (when this movie was released), but of everyday life, and how easily one's personal privacy can be invaded. One can't walk away from this movie without a touch of paranoia, and a test of one's morality. Trademark Coppola, particularly in his prime in the 70s where he made his viewers question the ramifications of their everyday actions, behaviors, conversations and involvements. Gene Hackman is outstanding as the lead character, Harry Caul, the renowned genius of surveillance, His portrayal of a paranoid man who realizes the ramifications of his work is brilliant, and portrayed only with combination of his and Coppola's skills, along with masterful editing and memorable scenes. Coppola makes use of great character actors, and often and/or previously used Coppola favorites- Harrison Ford, John Cazale, Cindy Williams, Robert DuVall, Terri Garrr and Frederick Forest are among an incredibly effective cast, and script. By the time this movie reaches is climax, your suspicions of the possibilities of every day life built up little by little in this movie are only reaffirmed, to a creepy extent. A masterpiece  of a film with all the trademarks of a Coppola gem, overshadowed only by his classic standard that all his future films would be measured by (""Godfather""). One of my all time favorite films, but toughest watches. One needn't be involved in any seedy behavior to walk away from this film with a touch of paranoia. Don't think that wasn't by design.

Great story of a moral man deteriorating at an immoral job. Gene Hackman gives a powerfully quiet performance that ranks among his  best.

The last scene of  Hackman tearing his appartment apart is among the most powerful scenes ever  filmed. A great picture.

521742,A2AU2HM2MW8KDQ,B00003CX9I,Bill Perez,"[1, 1]","The plot and charcters have been well described elsewhere, so I won't recount them here. Perhaps because I first watched (and rewatched, and re-rewatched) this film when I was 12 (I would see whatever movie the neighborhood theater was playing), the plot has an air of inevitability for me now. My current perspective is that far from possessing a &quot;twist&quot;, the surprise in store for Harry Caul is one demanded by his personality, by his life. He realizes that he has become precisely what he proudly aspired to become: simply a tool, a lifeless extension of his fancy directional mikes, synchronized reel-to-reels, and homemade frequency filters--he is a vending machine that accepts envelopes of cash, and ejects high-quality tapes of anyone's most private conversations. As we see his character built piece by hollow, empty piece, the thin feeble ghost of what is left of his humanity emerges defiant, but ultimately impotent--he has been too &quot;good&quot; at what he does. His supercooled technician's distance cannot stably coexist with the white-hot emotional nature of his product, and his walls (literally, in the end) are torn down. As he unfolds his puzzle, he finds his paranoia has been grossly misplaced, and what he sees as emotional detachment is simply a profound naivete causing him to both lose and fatally misinterpret his own excellent recordings.But despite all this plot/character talk, I think this film has even more to offer at other levels. This is a movie that, as the title implies, repeatedly insists we &quot;watch&quot; with our ears. The sound is ostensibly hardcore realism (apart from a beautiful but minimalist piano score, and the occasional tension-emphasizing dark roars of white noise), but since the main character is basically a sound technician, the &quot;realism&quot; transforms into a montage of repetitive loops and rewinds, reverbed replays and frequency modulations insanely (and, it seems, annoyingly for some viewers) cavorting against a backdrop of everyday urban noises. And, of course, being a Coppola movie, the movie contains sublime photography and imagery: the scene where Caul is in a phonebooth, arranging delivery of the tapes, has him gradually consumed by sharp-edged overlapping planes of reflected city light that reminded me of the fractured bits of conversation he welded together from urban lunchtime hubbub [it is also interesting that, in that shot, the closer we get to him, the less discernable he becomes]; the dim, vast, mostly empty loft where he does his work produces one striking tableau after another (and is clearly symbolic); and the odd translucent raincoat that he wears in all weather underscores his ghostly nature.Simply put, I love this movie.",5,To Be Watched With Your Ears,982540800,"02 19, 2001",2001,2741,"['plot', 'charcters', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'described', 'elsewhere', 'wo', ""n't"", 'recount', 'here', 'Perhaps', 'first', 'watched', 'rewatched', 're-rewatched', 'film', 'when', 'was', '12', 'would', 'see', 'movie', 'neighborhood', 'theater', 'was', 'playing', 'plot', 'air', 'inevitability', 'now', 'current', 'perspective', 'far', 'possessing', 'quot', 'twist', 'quot', 'surprise', 'store', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'one', 'demanded', 'personality', 'life', 'become', 'precisely', 'what', 'proudly', 'aspired', 'become', 'simply', 'tool', 'lifeless', 'extension', 'fancy', 'directional', 'mikes', 'synchronized', 'reel-to-reels', 'homemade', 'frequency', 'filters', 'vending', 'machine', 'envelopes', 'cash', 'high-quality', 'tapes', 'anyone', 'most', 'private', 'conversations', 'see', 'character', 'built', 'piece', 'hollow', 'empty', 'piece', 'thin', 'feeble', 'ghost', 'what', 'left', 'humanity', 'defiant', 'ultimately', 'impotent', 'been', 'too', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'what', 'supercooled', 'technician', 'distance', 'can', 'not', 'stably', 'coexist', 'white-hot', 'emotional', 'nature', 'product', 'walls', 'literally', 'end', 'are', 'torn', 'down', 'puzzle', 'paranoia', 'been', 'grossly', 'misplaced', 'what', 'emotional', 'detachment', 'simply', 'profound', 'naivete', 'causing', 'lose', 'fatally', 'misinterpret', 'own', 'excellent', 'recordings.But', 'plot/character', 'talk', 'think', 'film', 'even', 'more', 'offer', 'other', 'levels', 'movie', 'title', 'implies', 'repeatedly', 'quot', 'watch', 'quot', 'ears', 'sound', 'ostensibly', 'hardcore', 'realism', 'apart', 'beautiful', 'minimalist', 'piano', 'score', 'occasional', 'tension-emphasizing', 'dark', 'roars', 'white', 'noise', 'main', 'character', 'basically', 'sound', 'technician', 'quot', 'realism', 'quot', 'transforms', 'montage', 'repetitive', 'loops', 'rewinds', 'reverbed', 'replays', 'frequency', 'modulations', 'insanely', 'annoyingly', 'viewers', 'cavorting', 'backdrop', 'everyday', 'urban', 'noises', 'course', 'being', 'Coppola', 'movie', 'movie', 'sublime', 'photography', 'imagery', 'scene', 'where', 'Caul', 'phonebooth', 'arranging', 'delivery', 'tapes', 'gradually', 'consumed', 'sharp-edged', 'overlapping', 'planes', 'reflected', 'city', 'light', 'reminded', 'fractured', 'bits', 'conversation', 'welded', 'together', 'urban', 'lunchtime', 'hubbub', '[', 'also', 'interesting', 'shot', 'closer', 'get', 'less', 'discernable', ']', 'dim', 'vast', 'mostly', 'empty', 'loft', 'where', 'work', 'one', 'striking', 'tableau', 'clearly', 'symbolic', 'odd', 'translucent', 'raincoat', 'weather', 'ghostly', 'nature.Simply', 'put', 'love', 'movie']",The Conversation

521745,A1HUBEP5DJ6W51,B00003CX9I,Brooke276,"[10, 14]","Some films exist solely as mindless entertainment; juggling noise, color, and state of the art effects in order to provide a few hours of harmless distraction. Others, plot-heavy and overly reliant on incident and contrivance, keep the audience guessing with last-minute revelations and wild reversals of fortune. However, as a lasting form of cinema, the &quot;film of ideas&quot; -- vague, ambiguous, subtle in form and execution -- leaves an impression that is not easily dismissed. &quot;The Conversation,&quot; a cinematic highlight of the greatest of all film decades (the 1970s), boldly explores ideas not as engines to drive the plot forward, but rather as valuable pursuits in their own right; challenges to the viewer to consider unfamiliar philosophical questions and possibilities.Coppola's genius in this film is to provide a skeleton plot (surveillance expert hears something disturbing on a tape, pursues the &quot;truth&quot; behind the mystery) while emphasizing character insight and social examination. The idea, strongly felt, is paranoia -- the crippling, consuming inability to connect with other human beings or an external reality out of fear and, at bottom, a misanthropic distrust of mankind. Harry Caul (an understated, stunning Gene Hackman), the central focus of Coppola's disturbing vision, strains for a near-impossible level of detachment from his work, much to the chagrin (and frustration) of his co-workers. Several attempt conversation, but Caul is the epitome of professionalism (&quot;All I care about is getting a big, fat recording&quot;).He claims that he is above listening to the subjects of his surveillance, but a new assignment brings about unfamiliar guilt (largely because he is reminded of a previous case where his work indirectly caused the deaths of several people). He continually reminds himself (and others) that he is not responsible for the harm that might come to others (after all, he does his work, exchanges it for cash, and moves on to the next assignment), but deep in his mind (and conscience), he knows all-too-well how invasions of privacy stimulate rage, revenge, and often end in violence.Given that this film was released in 1974 (just as Watergate was winding down toward Nixon's resignation), it no doubt stimulated comparisons to that real-life event. However, rather than remaining a dated curiosity, the film serves as a frightening metaphor for our own age; a time of media saturation, corporate hegemony, and the sanctification of hedonism. Given such an environment, privacy vanishes not only as a reality, but also as an ideal. We are, as stated in &quot;Rear Window,&quot; a race of peeping toms, fascinated by personal revelation and heretofore behind-the-scenes activity. From sexual interaction to bathroom behavior, few things are kept secret, largely out of our desire to &quot;expose&quot; and destroy (which acts as a leveling effect). Coppola's ability to foresee the ubiquity of surveillance cameras (at work, in stores, schools, and parking lots), wire-taps (Linda Tripp, anyone?) and private investigators speaks to his understanding of human nature. We are a nation of confession and unwarranted revelation; reveling in our release of dirty secrets and self-serving detail.Still, &quot;The Conversation&quot; resonates today because it reveals an essential truth about American life -- we simply do not trust each other. Either out of cynicism or solipsistic arrogance (we do not believe we can or should ever know the reality of another), Americans increasingly seek refuge from input and interaction. This is an interesting turn of events given our obsession with revelation, but it does in fact exist, contradictions and all. Harry Caul, so full of paranoia that he is content to pursue sexual relationships of absolute anonymity (even his &quot;girlfriend&quot; is a stranger), is our Everyman. Hypocritical in that he insists on personal privacy while investigating others; self-righteous in that he insists on moral absolution and detachment despite criminal behavior; and sufficiently dehumanized to live in a barren wasteland of humorless avoidance (he has the pleasure of a saxophone, yet his apartment is nothing more than a holding cell). He has taken disconnection to its frightening, logical conclusion: besieged by loneliness, any human contact we desire must be surreptitiously acquired -- without risk, without confrontation, and ultimately without meaning.",5,"Masterful study of paranoia, guilt, and alienation.",975628800,"12 1, 2000",2000,4464,"['films', 'exist', 'solely', 'mindless', 'entertainment', 'juggling', 'noise', 'color', 'state', 'art', 'effects', 'order', 'provide', 'few', 'hours', 'harmless', 'distraction', 'Others', 'plot-heavy', 'overly', 'reliant', 'incident', 'contrivance', 'keep', 'audience', 'guessing', 'last-minute', 'revelations', 'wild', 'reversals', 'fortune', 'However', 'lasting', 'form', 'cinema', 'quot', 'film', 'ideas', 'quot', 'vague', 'ambiguous', 'subtle', 'form', 'execution', 'impression', 'not', 'easily', 'dismissed', 'quot', 'Conversation', 'quot', 'cinematic', 'highlight', 'greatest', 'film', 'decades', '1970s', 'boldly', 'ideas', 'not', 'engines', 'drive', 'plot', 'forward', 'rather', 'valuable', 'pursuits', 'own', 'right', 'challenges', 'viewer', 'consider', 'unfamiliar', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'possibilities.Coppola', 'genius', 'film', 'provide', 'skeleton', 'plot', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'something', 'disturbing', 'tape', 'quot', 'truth', 'quot', 'mystery', 'emphasizing', 'character', 'insight', 'social', 'examination', 'idea', 'strongly', 'felt', 'paranoia', 'crippling', 'consuming', 'inability', 'connect', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'external', 'reality', 'fear', 'bottom', 'misanthropic', 'distrust', 'mankind', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'understated', 'stunning', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'central', 'focus', 'Coppola', 'disturbing', 'vision', 'near-impossible', 'level', 'detachment', 'work', 'much', 'chagrin', 'frustration', 'co-workers', 'Several', 'attempt', 'conversation', 'Caul', 'epitome', 'professionalism', 'quot', 'care', 'getting', 'big', 'fat', 'recording', 'quot', '.He', 'claims', 'listening', 'subjects', 'surveillance', 'new', 'assignment', 'unfamiliar', 'guilt', 'largely', 'reminded', 'previous', 'case', 'where', 'work', 'indirectly', 'caused', 'deaths', 'several', 'people', 'continually', 'others', 'not', 'responsible', 'harm', 'might', 'come', 'others', 'work', 'exchanges', 'cash', 'moves', 'next', 'assignment', 'deep', 'mind', 'conscience', 'all-too-well', 'how', 'invasions', 'privacy', 'stimulate', 'rage', 'revenge', 'often', 'end', 'violence.Given', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1974', 'just', 'Watergate', 'was', 'winding', 'down', 'Nixon', 'resignation', 'doubt', 'stimulated', 'comparisons', 'real-life', 'event', 'However', 'rather', 'remaining', 'dated', 'curiosity', 'film', 'frightening', 'metaphor', 'own', 'age', 'time', 'media', 'saturation', 'corporate', 'hegemony', 'sanctification', 'hedonism', 'Given', 'environment', 'privacy', 'vanishes', 'not', 'only', 'reality', 'also', 'ideal', 'are', 'stated', 'quot', 'Rear', 'Window', 'quot', 'race', 'peeping', 'toms', 'fascinated', 'personal', 'revelation', 'heretofore', 'behind-the-scenes', 'activity', 'sexual', 'interaction', 'bathroom', 'behavior', 'few', 'things', 'are', 'kept', 'secret', 'largely', 'desire', 'quot', 'quot', 'destroy', 'leveling', 'effect', 'Coppola', 'ability', 'foresee', 'ubiquity', 'surveillance', 'cameras', 'work', 'stores', 'schools', 'parking', 'lots', 'wire-taps', 'Linda', 'Tripp', 'anyone', 'private', 'investigators', 'speaks', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'are', 'nation', 'confession', 'unwarranted', 'revelation', 'reveling', 'release', 'dirty', 'secrets', 'self-serving', 'detail.Still', 'quot', 'Conversation', 'quot', 'resonates', 'today', 'essential', 'truth', 'American', 'life', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'trust', 'other', 'cynicism', 'solipsistic', 'arrogance', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'can', 'should', 'ever', 'know', 'reality', 'Americans', 'increasingly', 'seek', 'refuge', 'input', 'interaction', 'interesting', 'turn', 'events', 'given', 'obsession', 'revelation', 'fact', 'exist', 'contradictions', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'full', 'paranoia', 'content', 'pursue', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'absolute', 'anonymity', 'even', 'quot', 'quot', 'stranger', 'Everyman', 'Hypocritical', 'personal', 'privacy', 'investigating', 'others', 'self-righteous', 'moral', 'absolution', 'detachment', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'sufficiently', 'dehumanized', 'live', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'humorless', 'avoidance', 'pleasure', 'saxophone', 'yet', 'apartment', 'nothing', 'more', 'holding', 'cell', 'taken', 'disconnection', 'frightening', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'besieged', 'loneliness', 'human', 'contact', 'desire', 'must', 'be', 'surreptitiously', 'acquired', 'risk', 'confrontation', 'ultimately', 'meaning']",The Conversation

It holds up beautifully and is absolutely top work from these two superstars.  The plot was very popular post Watergate: paranoia especially about who might be checking you out and how.  Hackman is superb as Harry whose career is listening in on others as the creme de al creme of surveillance experts.  He happens to pick up the conversation of a man and a woman who are possibly involved in a murder plot.  Like peeling an onion, we go through layer after layer of Harry's surveillance work.  We will unravel this mystery but this movie offers so much more than a mystery. The genius of this film is that even though the technology is dated by our year 2000, the movie holds up because it is not really about technology.  It is a very profound movie about much deeper subjects including the cumulative effects of loneliness, isolation and alienation.  The one scene of Hackman that remains riveted in my mind for all time is him looking for a surveillance bug in his own house, tearing his place up plank by plank.  His sole connection to his feelings, emotions and life itself is his relationship with his saxophone and I will always remember him playing it in the ruins of his house.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[3, 4]","Regardless of my title--a quote from the film meant to be ironic in this context--The Conversation was a brilliant, intelligent film. On paper it doesn't sound like the sort of drama that lends itself to cinematic treatment: A man eavesdrops and records conversations for a living. He is tops in his field and takes great pride in his professionalism. Sometimes his work results in great harm to people, even death, so he tries to detach himself from what he is doing. He is conflicted. Knowing also about how easy it is to tap phones, bug rooms, and eavesdrop on people, he is understandably a little paranoid. He guards his personal privacy zealously. Is it still paranoia, though, when they actually are listening--are out to get you? With a protagonist who keeps so much hidden, it hardly seems like a formula for a compelling film, but in the hands of Director Francis Ford Coppola, with Gene Hackman giving one of his greatest performances, a compelling film is exactly what you get.---------------Martin Stett: We know that you know, Mr. Caul. For your own sake, don't get involved any further.===================Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a professional Surveillance Expert. In an early scene Caul is talking to his landlady on the phone, disturbed that she has entered his apartment and left him a birthday gift. He wants to have the only copies of his keys. He seems to be over reacting, but subsequent events will make you wonder if he wasn't correct in his suspicions. While Hackman's character may be over reacting, Hackman is certainly not over acting. He holds back and trades in subtle nuance. Slowly, piece-by-piece, the puzzle is put together. There is a murder plot, but that is merely subtext. The real drama is what is happening to Harry Caul, and his futile attempts to stay detached from the consequences of his job.For this role, Hackman learned to play tenor saxophone, and it was an excellent choice for his character. He acts on the saxophone, playing it exactly like his character would. He plays along with old jazz recordings, fitting in with the song being played, but in an abstract, almost obtuse manner. His audiophile equipment and intense listening to the tapes he plays along with, and the way he concentrates on his own tone, speak volumes about his character and his chosen profession.Along with the vintage jazz recordings on the soundtrack there is also some great music composed for the film by David Shire. In fact, Shire scored the music before the film was shot, and Copolla played it on the set to set the mood. Shire wrote a great piano theme of jazz-influenced 20th Century Classical Music. It is haunting and captures the existential angst quite well. Bravo, David Shire.---------------------Martin Stett: [Final Line] We'll be listening to you.==========================Allen Garfield's William P. 'Bernie' Moran is Harry Caul's rival, but while Caul is introverted, Bernie is anything but. He is a crass, brash practitioner of surveillance with little or no regard for the consequences. The scenes at the Surveillance Convention and the party later at Caul's studio are brilliant. Garfield stands out in a field of fine performances by Teri Garr, Cindy Williams (Shirley on Laverne & Shirley), Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, and the rest (as they say on Gilligan's Isle).Robert Shields plays a mime in Union Square. In real life he actually did get his start working the crowd at Union Square. This is a crucial scene, as the crucial conversation is recorded here, with the subjects thinking that all the commotion and extraneous noise would make recording them impossible. A mime, impersonating people without making a sound, is somehow bitterly ironic. Here and throughout, Coppola uses the San Francisco location well, as only a true San Franciscan could. Not the picture postcard scenes a tourist would send, but places like Embarcadero Center, with its poured concrete effect, or the Jack Tarr Hotel. Some very ugly architecture that nevertheless made me feel homesick for The City by The Bay. Have you seen my heart anywhere? I think I left it there.The bottom line is that The Conversation, directed by Francis Ford Copolla, is not only entertaining, but also intelligent and thought provoking. It says so much about our modern condition, and its message has only grown more relevant as time goes on. The Conversation was like a brilliant, scintillating conversation with a beautiful woman in Cafe Trieste over espresso after the San Francisco Opera.-------------------------Stan: What a STUPID conversation.===============================Heartbreakers(2001) Gene Hackman was William B.

This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-""Unforgiven.""  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of ""Rear Window."" As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2",2,This Waiting Waiting Waiting is Tough,1158883200,"09 22, 2006",2006,2971,"['end', 'film', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'character', 'strung', 'out', 'thanks', 'surveillance', 'heavy', 'lifestyle', 'finally', 'snaps', 'pulls', 'apart', 'house', 'search', 'mythical', 'bug', 'scene', 'examination', 'psychological', 'toll', 'surveillance', 'not', 'only', 'listen-ee', 'also', 'listener', 'Hackman', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'who', 'top', 'field', 'assigned', 'mysterious', 'conversation', 'piece', 'together', 'film', 'More', 'interesting', 'was', 'see', 'little', 'ways', 'job', 'affected', 'life', 'staunchly', 'privacy', 'even', 'job', 'invade', 'open', 'up', 'people', 'paranoid', 'anything', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'know', 'today', 'very', 'fashionable', 'criticize', 'Bush', 'wire', 'tapping', 'program', 'film', 'only', 'chilling', 'affect', 'watch', 'take', 'place', 'world', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'microcosm', 'what', 'happening', 'world', 'today', 'Simply', 'are', 'aware', 'Bush', 'spying', 'ways', 'engage', 'self-censorship', 'time', 'send', 'email', 'talk', 'cell', 'phone', 'Harry', 'reality', 'situation', 'descending', 'madness', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'healthy', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'say', 'handling', 'wrong', 'way.While', 'are', 'lessons', 'here', 'deal', 'living', 'Bush', 'America', 'still', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'film', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'Coppola', 'usually', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'fit', 'script', 'was', 'original', 'unpredictable', 'However', 'was', 'also', 'slow', 'filled', 'nonsense', 'watched', 'film', 'twice', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'firm', 'grasp', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'Also', 'scene', 'visit', 'Harry', 'twisted', 'dream', 'was', 'total', 'miss', 'purpose', 'was', 'show', 'just', 'had', 'mad', 'had', 'gone', 'looked', 'Coppola', 'losing', 'control', 'script', 'inserting', 'scene', 'only', 'served', 'take', 'viewers', 'film', 'Hackman', 'good', 'performance', 'was', 'norm', 'pre-', 'Unforgiven', 'dashing', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'trotted', 'remind', 'just', 'how', 'old', 'gotten', 'Still', 'film', 'flat.Most', 'film', 'Harry', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'entire', 'conversation', 'tools', 'using', 'look', 'downright', 'quaint', 'compared', 'what', 'know', 'Big', 'Brother', 'using', 'today', 'liked', 'way', 'film', 'reminded', 'Rear', 'Window', 'film', 'watch', 'lonely', 'man', 'imagination', 'run', 'away', 'theme', 'daily', 'lives', 'Every', 'story', 'hear', 'holes', 'have', 'fill', 'holes', 'sort', 'BS', 'come', 'perceived', 'reality', 'what', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'Nobody', 'being', 'called', 'paranoid', 'nobody', 'likes', 'be', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'other', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', 'explore', 'ideas', 'Then', 'think', 'communication', 'behavior', 'paranoid', 'ignorant', 'Ok', 'cell', 'phone', 'coming', 'built', 'bug', '**1/2']",The Conversation

Slipman,"[10, 10]","Francis Ford Coppola's masterful insight into the clandestine world of surveillance ""The Conversation"" was appropriately released at the time of the Watergate scandal.  The venerable Gene Hackman taciturnly plays Harry Caul an intensely private world renowned surveillance expert who lives in a world sheltered from personal interactions.Hackman is hired to record a conversation between a young couple walking through a park by a man known as the Director, played in a cameo by Robert Duvall.  He ingeniously orchestrates a scheme using a four man team to record the dialogue between Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest playing the couple.  While analyzing the tapes he realizes that the couple may be getting set up for execution.  In his past a previous surveillance job of Hackman's resulted in the murder of three people.Hackman suddenly comes to grips with his conscience and has misgivings about relinquishing the tapes to the Director's assistant Martin Stett played by a very youthful Harrison Ford.  Hackman is set up and the tapes are stolen from him.  Determined to short circuit the possible execution he sets himself up in a hotel room adjoining a room mentioned in the recorded conversation.  Using a listening device he hears a violent crime being committed but not the one he expected.Back in the safety of his supposedly bug proof apartment, Hackman gets a phone call from Ford threatening him to forget what happened.  Hackman is also made aware that his fortress of solitude apartment has been wiretapped, his worst possible hellish nightmare.As the film concludes we see Hackman sitting is his apartment which in a paranoid frenzy he has totally torn apart in search of the planted surveillance equipment.",5,A wiretapper's nightmare,1142035200,"03 11, 2006",2006,1726,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'masterful', 'insight', 'clandestine', 'world', 'surveillance', 'Conversation', 'was', 'appropriately', 'released', 'time', 'Watergate', 'scandal', 'venerable', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'taciturnly', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'intensely', 'private', 'world', 'renowned', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'who', 'world', 'sheltered', 'personal', 'interactions.Hackman', 'hired', 'record', 'conversation', 'young', 'couple', 'walking', 'park', 'man', 'known', 'Director', 'played', 'cameo', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'ingeniously', 'scheme', 'using', 'four', 'man', 'team', 'record', 'dialogue', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'playing', 'couple', 'analyzing', 'tapes', 'couple', 'may', 'be', 'getting', 'set', 'up', 'execution', 'past', 'previous', 'surveillance', 'job', 'Hackman', 'resulted', 'murder', 'three', 'people.Hackman', 'suddenly', 'grips', 'conscience', 'misgivings', 'relinquishing', 'tapes', 'Director', 'assistant', 'Martin', 'Stett', 'played', 'very', 'youthful', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Hackman', 'set', 'up', 'tapes', 'are', 'stolen', 'Determined', 'short', 'circuit', 'possible', 'execution', 'up', 'hotel', 'room', 'adjoining', 'room', 'mentioned', 'recorded', 'conversation', 'Using', 'listening', 'device', 'violent', 'crime', 'being', 'committed', 'not', 'one', 'safety', 'supposedly', 'bug', 'proof', 'apartment', 'Hackman', 'phone', 'call', 'Ford', 'threatening', 'forget', 'what', 'happened', 'Hackman', 'also', 'made', 'aware', 'fortress', 'solitude', 'apartment', 'been', 'wiretapped', 'worst', 'possible', 'hellish', 'film', 'see', 'Hackman', 'sitting', 'apartment', 'paranoid', 'frenzy', 'totally', 'torn', 'apart', 'search', 'planted', 'surveillance', 'equipment']",The Conversation

The Conversation (1974), written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is not one of those minor works. It has a manifest endebtedness to Michelangelo Antonioni's brilliant 1966 film, Blowup, yet it does not merely ape that film's existential dilemma of an accidental photograph possibly cluing its lead character into murder. Instead, The Conversation  probes far more deeply into its lead character Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) and his life, to see what might cause a man to misinterpret reality to suit his own psychic needs.Another major difference is that the tale in Blowup is one that is wholly accidental, whereas the story The Conversation is built upon is an outgrowth of the deliberate and paid for actions of Caul, the leading West Coast surveillance expert, who has been hired by the mysterious Director (Robert Duvall) of a giant corporation to spy on his wife Ann (Cindy Williams) and her lover Mark (Frederick Forrest). The film opens, around Christmastime, with Caul and his entourage tailing and listening in to the conversation of the two lovers as they stroll in Union Square, an open air park in downtown San Francisco. The fragmented bits of conversation he pieces together only later, and comes to feel that the couple is being set up for murder by his employer. The opening zoom down from a sniper's eye level, focuses on a mime (Robert Shields) who is annoying people in the square. Eventually he sidles up to and mimics Caul, who walks away. The opening scene was filmed by Haskell Wexler, and the rest of the film by Bill Butler, who took over after Wexler and Coppola had a falling out.It is a shame that in the nearly thirty years since the 1970s, Coppola has never made a film that comes close to the power of his films from that era. Despite its debt to Blowup, The Conversation is a far more realistic and multi-layered film. That does not mean it's better nor worse than Blowup, just not a ripoff. It is far more internalized, even if a little less subjective, than the earlier film. This seeming disconnect between the objective and that witnessed by the audience only deepens the desire to rewatch the film. Especially great is the fact that the film's lead is the sort of character other films ignore, to focus on one of the players in the love triangle, or perhaps Martin Stett. Caul is a functionary, an apparatchik- yet he's real, and his struggle is every bit as interesting as the `sexier characters'. Yet Coppola heeds Juvenal's query from his sixth Satire: `Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?' (`Who watches the watchmen?') There are many watchers in this film, yet the final watcher is the audience, and what they watch is greatness, simple in its complexity.The Conversation is a great, simple, and small film, never too long at an hour and fifty-three minutes, and it may be Coppola's best. It was very timely, considering the milieu of Watergate, but the idea came to him in 1967. It started filming in late 1972, and wrapped shortly before Watergate came to light, yet it has been lost between the three other titanic films he made in the 1970s: The Godfather, The Godfather, Part II, and Apocalypse Now. Whereas those three films were operatic, this film is a chamber piece, and apropos of that, the piano only soundtrack by Coppola's brother in law David Shire, so reminiscent of Erik Satie piano pieces, is perfect, for, as Coppola says in his commentary, the piano is a lonely instrument; lonely as Harry Caul, or an unanswered question.",5,Great,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3688,"['are', 'works', 'art', 'are', 'obviously', 'derivative', 'others', 'obviously', 'inferior', 'simply', 'ape', 'earlier', 'work', 'tweak', 'few', 'minor', 'things', 'try', 'pass', 'off', 'theft', 'homage', 'Conversation', '1974', 'written', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'not', 'one', 'minor', 'works', 'manifest', 'endebtedness', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'brilliant', '1966', 'film', 'Blowup', 'yet', 'not', 'merely', 'ape', 'film', 'existential', 'dilemma', 'accidental', 'photograph', 'possibly', 'cluing', 'lead', 'character', 'murder', 'Instead', 'Conversation', 'far', 'more', 'deeply', 'lead', 'character', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'life', 'see', 'what', 'might', 'cause', 'man', 'misinterpret', 'reality', 'suit', 'own', 'psychic', 'needs.Another', 'major', 'difference', 'tale', 'Blowup', 'one', 'wholly', 'accidental', 'story', 'Conversation', 'built', 'outgrowth', 'deliberate', 'paid', 'actions', 'Caul', 'leading', 'West', 'Coast', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'mysterious', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'giant', 'corporation', 'spy', 'wife', 'Ann', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'lover', 'Mark', 'Frederick', 'Forrest', 'film', 'Christmastime', 'Caul', 'entourage', 'tailing', 'listening', 'conversation', 'two', 'lovers', 'stroll', 'Union', 'Square', 'open', 'air', 'park', 'downtown', 'San', 'Francisco', 'fragmented', 'bits', 'conversation', 'together', 'only', 'later', 'feel', 'couple', 'being', 'set', 'up', 'murder', 'employer', 'opening', 'zoom', 'sniper', 'eye', 'level', 'mime', 'Robert', 'Shields', 'who', 'annoying', 'people', 'square', 'Eventually', 'mimics', 'Caul', 'who', 'away', 'opening', 'scene', 'was', 'filmed', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'rest', 'film', 'Bill', 'Butler', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'Wexler', 'Coppola', 'had', 'falling', 'out.It', 'shame', 'nearly', 'thirty', 'years', '1970s', 'Coppola', 'never', 'made', 'film', 'close', 'power', 'films', 'era', 'debt', 'Blowup', 'Conversation', 'far', 'more', 'realistic', 'multi-layered', 'film', 'not', 'mean', 'better', 'worse', 'Blowup', 'just', 'not', 'ripoff', 'far', 'more', 'internalized', 'even', 'little', 'less', 'subjective', 'earlier', 'film', 'seeming', 'disconnect', 'objective', 'witnessed', 'audience', 'only', 'desire', 'rewatch', 'film', 'Especially', 'great', 'fact', 'film', 'lead', 'sort', 'character', 'other', 'films', 'ignore', 'focus', 'one', 'players', 'love', 'triangle', 'perhaps', 'Martin', 'Stett', 'Caul', 'functionary', 'apparatchik-', 'yet', 'real', 'struggle', 'bit', 'as', 'interesting', 'sexier', 'characters', 'Coppola', 'Juvenal', 'query', 'sixth', 'Satire', 'Quis', 'custodiet', 'ipsos', 'custodes', 'Who', 'watchmen', 'are', 'many', 'watchers', 'film', 'final', 'watcher', 'audience', 'what', 'watch', 'greatness', 'simple', 'complexity.The', 'Conversation', 'great', 'simple', 'small', 'film', 'never', 'too', 'long', 'hour', 'fifty-three', 'minutes', 'may', 'be', 'Coppola', 'best', 'was', 'very', 'timely', 'considering', 'milieu', 'Watergate', 'idea', 'came', '1967', 'started', 'filming', 'late', '1972', 'wrapped', 'shortly', 'Watergate', 'came', 'light', 'been', 'lost', 'three', 'other', 'titanic', 'films', 'made', '1970s', 'Godfather', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'II', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Whereas', 'three', 'films', 'were', 'operatic', 'film', 'chamber', 'piece', 'apropos', 'piano', 'only', 'soundtrack', 'Coppola', 'brother', 'law', 'David', 'Shire', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'Erik', 'Satie', 'piano', 'pieces', 'perfect', 'Coppola', 'commentary', 'piano', 'lonely', 'instrument', 'lonely', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'unanswered', 'question']",The Conversation

Markel,"[3, 3]","This review is for the 2000 Paramount Widescreen DVD release.The basic story line involves a free-lance surveillance expert name Harry Caul (played by Gene Hackman) who with the help of a high-tech field team records a conversation between a man and a woman in an open plaza in San Francisco.  The recording is made for a director of a private company (played by Robert Duvall).  While piecing segments of the conversation together from at least three surveillance tapes, Harry is greatly disturbed because he believes from the dialogue that foul play is inevitable.I won't go into the rest of the plot or the ending because I'd hate to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie.  In my opinion the film ended a little flat and arguably flawed and therefore I think there were better ways to end it.  Gene Hackman does deliver another great performance.  This movie in some ways reminds me of a later Hackman film entitled ""Enemy of the State"" which in my opinion is a much better film than this movie.  This movie also showcases a very young Harrison Ford.  The pace is slow and deliberate, but is well acted and the technology holds up well, even for being 30 years old.  Another strength of the movie is that it seems like a coldwar spy film, yet it deals with ominous people within the confines of the American borders that you or I could deal with on a daily basis.  Overall, it's a very good movie, but not a great one for me.The DVD transfer is sharp and flawless with vivid color.

521759,A2GYX971VETQBV,B00003CX9I,Daniel R. Sanderman,"[2, 2]","Having just watched THE CONVERSATION for the first time, I must say that I am utterly stunned.  It is one of the best films I have ever seen.  And to think, I just added it to my queue on the off-chance that Francis Ford Coppola's other films in the 1970s would reveal some of the same mastery as the GODFATHER franchise.  Francis Ford Coppola is, indeed, at the top of his game in THE CONVERSATION and the director's own fascination with his own screenplay is evident.  While many have flagged this movie as a 1970s exploration of lies & secrecy stemming from the Watergate incident, ultimately this film proves to be a character study on one of the saddest and complex characters ever to have graced the screen.The film opens up with a masterful long shot of a park in San Francisco, slowly zooming more and more on a character in the park, whom we later find out is Harry Caul (masterfully played by Gene Hackman in one of the best performances of his career).  Caul looks about him nervously as if paranoid that someone is watching him.  Of course, here we are, silently hovering above him, eavesdropping on Harry Caul's life.  It is the first of many such ""voyeuristic"" shots.  The plot soon becomes apparent.  Caul seems absorbed in following a couple as they walk around in circles in the park, sharing a conversation.  Gradually, it is revealed that there are several characters listening in with powerful directional microphones, all orchestrated by the able hands of Caul.  Harry Caul is one of the best surveillance men in the country and we learn that he gets paid top dollar to do what he does best--tail people, violate their privacy, and emerge with an audio tape of their intimate conversations.  Using the various recorded bits of audio, Harry is able to weave together a single master recording of the couple's conversation.  It is part art and part science.  Everything is going smoothly until Harry begins to listen to the content of his most recent assignment.  While piecing together the final tape, Harry discovers that his tape may lead to the couple's harm.  Despite his professional oaths to complete the job and tune out the content of the audio, Harry plays the tape over and over, further convincing himself that he may be responsible for something terrible.  The truth is that this has happened to Harry before and he has never gotten over it.  Try as he might to cling to the scientific and technical aspects of his craft, he is tortured by his knowledge.As Harry begins to become more and more involved with his most recent assignment, he becomes involved in a horrible and sinister plot that exposes him to just the sort of surveillance he fears.  What follows is Harry's descent into madness.  Given the nature of Harry's profession, he is a paranoid person, incredibly secretive and constantly convinced that he is being watched.  The sad irony of this fact is that Harry's life is so guarded and closed-off that there is nothing for other's to spy on.  In fact, we (the audience) are the ones who are violating Harry's private life.  There is no pleasure in this voyeurism.  Watching Harry's sad life unravel is a painful experience.  And yet we cannot take our eyes away from the screen.  THE CONVERSATION grabs your attention from the top of the film and doesn't let you go for an instant.  Coppola's shots seem to purposefully mimic the movements of surveillance cameras.  The shots are left open, characters walk in and out of frame, culminating in the film's final shot--a perfectly timed pan (back and forth) across Harry's apartment that feels exactly like watching a surveillance monitor.The twist at the end of THE CONVERSATION is shocking and mesmerizing--sparking as many questions as it answers.  If you haven't already seen this film, you must drop what you are doing and see it right away.  Gene Hackman turns in one of the best performances of his career, if not the best.  Normally, Hackman plays supermen who are supremely confident of themselves.  It is amazing to see his transformation here, a broken shell of a person, sneaking around in a plastic see-through rain parka.  Coppola's direction is amazing and his camera work is perfectly calibrated to match the mood of the film.  The effect of the ""voyeuristic"" shots is that we feel like intruders into Harry's world, eavesdropping on his private affairs.  And yet, as close as we are brought to Harry, the cold feel of the camera also serves to distance us at the same time.  I now have to see more of Coppola's work, but I can say that this is (by far) the best film that I have seen Coppola direct.

""Daniel""","[23, 27]","Written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, THE CONVERSATION is presented with a featurette, a trailer and two separate commentaries of Francis Coppola and editor Walter Murch. Sound and images are excellent for a 1974 movie.Gene Hackman is a private spy hired for his ability to record conversations that should have been kept secret. We can imagine that jealous husbands or big corporations are his main clients. The first 15 minutes of THE CONVERSATION are magistral, describing how Gene Hackman, with the help of his assistants, try to record a conversation between Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest who are strolling in a public park.Gene Hackman is described as a solitary man becoming more and more paranoiac as he tries to recreate the conversation he has recorded through three different microphones. He soon loses his girlfriend and his longtime assistant played by Teri Garr and John Cazale, two Coppola favorite actors, and must confront Robert Duvall and Harrison Ford whom he suspects to plot the murder of Duvall's lovely wife, Cindy Williams.THE CONVERSATION is a great thriller with suspense and twists as the director adopts the subjective point of view of Gene Hackman, it's also a drama involving a man tortured by his conscience and slowly closing his mind to the world. Gene Hackman recreating the reality by mixing recorded tapes is without a doubt a metaphor of the film director at work but Gene Hackman trying to recreate famous saxophone jazz solos alone in front of his record player is nothing less than one of the most tragic figures a director has ever created on screen.A DVD for your library.",5,MASTERPIECE,981763200,"02 10, 2001",2001,1629,"['Written', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'THE', 'CONVERSATION', 'presented', 'featurette', 'trailer', 'two', 'separate', 'commentaries', 'Francis', 'Coppola', 'editor', 'Walter', 'Murch', 'Sound', 'images', 'are', 'excellent', '1974', 'movie.Gene', 'Hackman', 'private', 'spy', 'hired', 'ability', 'record', 'conversations', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'kept', 'secret', 'can', 'imagine', 'jealous', 'husbands', 'big', 'corporations', 'are', 'main', 'clients', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'CONVERSATION', 'are', 'magistral', 'describing', 'how', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'help', 'assistants', 'try', 'record', 'conversation', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'who', 'are', 'strolling', 'public', 'park.Gene', 'Hackman', 'described', 'solitary', 'man', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'paranoiac', 'recreate', 'conversation', 'recorded', 'three', 'different', 'microphones', 'soon', 'girlfriend', 'longtime', 'assistant', 'played', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'John', 'Cazale', 'two', 'Coppola', 'favorite', 'actors', 'must', 'confront', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'whom', 'plot', 'murder', 'Duvall', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Cindy', 'Williams.THE', 'CONVERSATION', 'great', 'thriller', 'suspense', 'twists', 'director', 'subjective', 'point', 'view', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'also', 'drama', 'involving', 'man', 'tortured', 'conscience', 'slowly', 'closing', 'mind', 'world', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'recreating', 'reality', 'mixing', 'recorded', 'tapes', 'doubt', 'metaphor', 'film', 'director', 'work', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'trying', 'recreate', 'famous', 'saxophone', 'jazz', 'solos', 'alone', 'front', 'record', 'player', 'nothing', 'less', 'one', 'most', 'tragic', 'figures', 'director', 'ever', 'created', 'screen.A', 'DVD', 'library']",The Conversation

It is a thriller for people with an attention span, something all too rare in today&#8217;s smash-cut style of cinema.  Coppola establishes a quiet atmosphere of dread and slowly mounting tension as well as the compelling character study of a man who makes his living by invading the privacy of others but is so terrified of being seen that he has nearly isolated himself from the rest of the human race.  He allows a woman he loves (Terri Garr) to slip away because he cannot bring himself to share even the most superficial details of his life with her.

Coppola has said this is the movie of his that he likes best, and Gene Hackman who stars as Harry Caul, the paranoid, nerdish surveillance snoop who suddenly develops a conscience, said it was his favorite role.  In the case of Hackman, one can see why.  He dominates the screen with a subtle touch and some serious acting skills.  In the case of Coppola, well, I'm sure in his heart of hearts he knows he made at least three better films.  And of course, ""favorite"" doesn't mean ""best.""Because of some glaring plot holes and assorted implausibilities plus a slow pace, this film is not liked by some viewers.  But it has a kind of haunting power, partly based on the studied camera work, and partly based on a chilling (and clever) story that explodes in Harry Caul's face and surprises the viewer.  Also there is a nice underlying tension that Coppola develops and maintains that makes us want to know what is going on and to find out how it ends.Cindy Williams of TV's ""Laverne and Shirley"" fame plays Ann, the wife of a Fortune 500 type exec who is being recorded as she has a conversation with a friend as they walk around Central Park.  Harry Caul is doing the snooping.  It isn't clear why the conversation is important, and even though we hear bits of it again and again, it seems innocent, although one notes, Cindy Williams isn't smiling.  As the plot nears denouement, however, we and Harry Caul and the husband, who has hired Caul, realize something is being hidden behind the denotative meaning of the words that are spoken.  Part of the intrigue is to catch the real meaning of what is said.The plot holes?  Well, it is unlikely that super secret Harry Caul would invite rival snoopers to his studio for a party.  He is so paranoid about people knowing his business that he loses his girlfriend Amy (Teri Garr) because he won't give her his phone number or tell her where he lives.  And the way he tears up his apartment at the end looking for the hidden bug is silly (but psychologically correct of course since he has gone full blown obsessive).  Rationally speaking, he would be better off just moving.  I understand that in the original script penned by Coppola, Harry owned the apartment building and that would explain why he chose to tear up his apartment looking for the recording device rather than move somewhere else.  And think of the professional challenge!Frankly I didn't mind any of the inconsistencies that viewers have pointed out.  Yes, he would suspect that the pen put in his pocket by rival snooper Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) might be a microphone, and, no, the hidden bug was NOT in his saxophone, but may have been in his eyeglasses (and anyway it doesn't matter).  What I didn't like were the dream sequences that you couldn't separate from reality.  I also didn't like the pristine clean toilet in room 773 that overflowed with bright red blood when he flushes it.  Not likely, when you think about it.But none of this matters.  This is an intriguing film with a significant theme, namely that the invasion of privacy has consequences, which is as relevant today as it was then.  Look for a young Harrison Ford as Martin Stett, the exec's assistant, and for Elizabeth MacRae as a caloric-challenged seductress.  But by all means see this for Francis Ford Coppola, one of the greats.  The Conversation is rated #169 at the Internet Movie Database.

Some of the films of his that I have seen (e.g. Patton, for which Coppola wrote the screenplay; The Godfather, directed by Coppola) have been quite intense and slightly off-beat, and this film follows that trend. The story is about a surveillance specialist, Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), who is employed by government agencies to eavesdrop on other peoples' lives. In this instance, all of his attention is focussed on a young couple, apparently meeting in secret in a crowded square. They are being watched by three of Harry's employees. The film is about Harry piecing together their conversation and its consequences. The Agency Director for whom Harry is working is played (briefly!) by Robert Duvall. There is a bigger role for the Director's assistant Martin Stett (played by Harrison Ford) who runs interference for Duvall. One of the characters who stands out is a rather obnoxious competitor of Harry's, Bernie Moran (Allen Garfield) who tries to wheedle out secrets from Harry. The moral of the story is that Harry really doesn't care what people do with the information he supplies, but in the end he develops something of a conscience.

Gene Hackman's riveting portrayal of Caul--a dramatic change of pace from iron-willed characters like ""The French Connection""'s Popeye Doyle--shows us a man riven by conflicting emotions. Pride, obsessiveness, professionalism, lust, and good old Catholic guilt are all at war in Harry's tortured soul, pulling him in a multitude of different directions as the movie unfolds.At the film's outset, we see him overseeing the surveilance of the conversation in question, a perplexing, half-heard dialogue between a young couple out for a lunchtime stroll in a public park in San Francisco. Snippets of this conversation loop through Harry's mind and through the movie, playing and re-playing, but he--and we--only gradually uncover its true meaning.Gradually, Harry begins to suspect that, if he does his job right, the couple in question may be killed. In a mesmerizing drunken dream sequence, he walks after the woman on a foggy night, trying to clear his own conscience about what he has done and what he might do. To the women in his life, Harry is maddeningly tight-lipped--not mentioning his birthday until the day of, lying about his age for no apparent reason, saying nothing about his professional or personal life--but to this dream-apparition, he is willing to say everything, from his oldest memories to his darkest fears.Haunted by those fears, and by the consequences of his past behavior in a similar situation (just like Jack Nicholson's Jake Geddes in 1974's also-excellent ""Chinatown""), Harry tries to make things turn out better this time. But events soon rocket out of control on their way to an unforgettable, poetic, haunting ending.If you don't own this movie, buy it--putting it in your Netflix queue or hopping over to Blockbuster and watching it only once will leave you cheated, though you won't know it at the time. For even if (like me) you can figure out the exact mechanics of the plot on the first run-through, added viewings reveal deeper themes and fuller layers of meaning behind seemingly insignificant snippets of dialogue. Like the conversation that loops and skips throughout the film, ""The Conversation"" can't be fully comprehended in just one take.",5,"A ""Conversation"" Worth Having",1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,2974,"['money', 'best', 'movie', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'ever', 'made.Say', 'what', 'will', 'imitated-to-the-point-of-parody', 'Godfather', 'movies', 'often', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'film', 'madness', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', ""'d"", 'still', 'rather', 'talk', 'Conversation', 'Ostensibly', 'thriller', 'professional', 'wiretapper', 'surveilance', 'single', 'conversation', 'what', 'be', 'adulterous', 'relationship', 'Conversation', 'also', 'thought-provoking', 'masterwork', 'secrets', 'lies', 'spies', 'power', 'Watergate-era', 'America', 'excellent', 'character', 'study', 'interplay', 'conscience', 'professionalism', 'one', 'profoundly', 'real', 'profoundly', 'fascinating', 'man.The', 'man', 'question', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'obsessed', 'secrets', 'keeping', 'own', 'finding', 'out', 'other', 'people', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'riveting', 'portrayal', 'Caul', 'dramatic', 'change', 'pace', 'iron-willed', 'characters', 'French', 'Connection', 'Popeye', 'Doyle', 'man', 'riven', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'Pride', 'obsessiveness', 'professionalism', 'lust', 'good', 'old', 'Catholic', 'guilt', 'are', 'war', 'Harry', 'tortured', 'soul', 'pulling', 'multitude', 'different', 'directions', 'movie', 'film', 'outset', 'see', 'overseeing', 'surveilance', 'conversation', 'question', 'perplexing', 'half-heard', 'dialogue', 'young', 'couple', 'lunchtime', 'stroll', 'public', 'park', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Snippets', 'conversation', 'Harry', 'mind', 'movie', 'playing', 're-playing', 'only', 'gradually', 'uncover', 'true', 'meaning.Gradually', 'Harry', 'suspect', 'job', 'right', 'couple', 'question', 'may', 'be', 'killed', 'mesmerizing', 'drunken', 'dream', 'sequence', 'woman', 'foggy', 'night', 'trying', 'clear', 'own', 'conscience', 'what', 'done', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'women', 'life', 'Harry', 'maddeningly', 'tight-lipped', 'not', 'mentioning', 'birthday', 'day', 'lying', 'age', 'apparent', 'reason', 'saying', 'nothing', 'professional', 'personal', 'life', 'dream-apparition', 'willing', 'say', 'everything', 'oldest', 'memories', 'darkest', 'fears.Haunted', 'fears', 'consequences', 'past', 'behavior', 'similar', 'situation', 'just', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Jake', 'Geddes', '1974', 'also-excellent', 'Chinatown', 'Harry', 'make', 'things', 'turn', 'out', 'better', 'time', 'events', 'soon', 'rocket', 'control', 'way', 'unforgettable', 'poetic', 'haunting', 'ending.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'movie', 'buy', 'putting', 'Netflix', 'queue', 'hopping', 'Blockbuster', 'watching', 'only', 'once', 'will', 'leave', 'cheated', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'time', 'even', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'exact', 'mechanics', 'plot', 'first', 'run-through', 'added', 'viewings', 'reveal', 'deeper', 'themes', 'fuller', 'layers', 'meaning', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'snippets', 'dialogue', 'conversation', 'loops', 'skips', 'film', 'Conversation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'fully', 'comprehended', 'just', 'one', 'take']",The Conversation
521780,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B00003CX9I,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[6, 7]","THE CONVERSATION (1974) does age well as a character study. Its technology seems dated, of course. Surveillance today I have no doubt would put that old reel to reel tape technology to shame, in the era of microchips and miniaturization. Coppola likes this little film, and he had trouble initially getting it produced. Only his success with THE GODFATHER allowed him the clout to twist a few arms. As a writer, influenced by Tennessee Williams, he wanted to take his small projects and make intimate films, not blockbusters. Isn't it odd that GODFATHER and APOCALYPSE NOW to this point stand as his cornerstone works, allowing him to do several other less successful smaller projects.Coppola chose his brother-in-law, David Shire to compose the music for THE CONVERSATION, and his haunting single piano seemed to hit just the right emotional timbre; and then to make Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) a saxophone player, who sits solo at night and wails away, was a wonderful secondary touch. Caul was such a cold fish, such a secretive human being; it was fun to hear complete statements coming from him in the language of jazz. It is an interesting name, Caul, meaning veil or membrane over the face of a fetus; heavy symbolism. Coppola stated that he was heavily influenced by Antonioni's BLOW UP (1966), and he liked the idea that the director's camera was watching the surveillance expert as he ""listened"" to other characters; working in a mystery that was also homage to Hitchcock. He, like Antonioni, shot abstractly at his characters, through and around plastic a lot; smoked barriers, rippled windows, pebbled glass, and the incessant appearance of Caul's god awful clear plastic raincoat.Robert Duvall did an uncredited cameo, and Frederic Forrest, John Cazale, and Teri Garr all did fine work as members of his repertory. Allen Garfield did a bang up job as the competing surveillance expert, Bernie Moran. Garr's sweet, yet sad, cloistered mistress cloys to our minds, in her white socks and short blond locks. A nice surprise was how good Harrison Ford really was in what could have been a non-descript walk on. Coppola was impressed with his inventiveness. Hackman found in Caul a character he could barely live with, and he had difficulty shedding it off camera. Still it stands as some of his best workHaskell Wexler shot the big opening sequence in the park, with the whole surveillance team. Then he and Coppola had an ""artistic difference of opinion"", and he was replaced by Bill Butler who did a seamless job of the rest of the film. Coppola said he closed down the film four days early because he was so stressed out. The dream sequence with Caul and Cindy Williams in the park, midst all that fog, was supposed to be part of the actual ending of the film, but the fog machine got out of hand, and people complained, sending in the SF police to harass the team. Coppola was faced with providing us with a different ending, and he found a perfect one. Caul, at last succumbed to his personal paranoia, tearing up his apartment looking for the bug Moran used on him, and then sitting exhausted in the wreckage, blowing out his pain in jazz riffs on his sax. Coppola suggested later that the bug might have been in the saxophone strap itself.",4,Sound and Fury,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,3253,"['CONVERSATION', '1974', 'age', 'well', 'character', 'study', 'technology', 'dated', 'course', 'Surveillance', 'today', 'have', 'doubt', 'would', 'put', 'old', 'reel', 'reel', 'tape', 'technology', 'shame', 'era', 'microchips', 'miniaturization', 'Coppola', 'little', 'film', 'had', 'trouble', 'initially', 'getting', 'produced', 'Only', 'success', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'allowed', 'clout', 'twist', 'few', 'arms', 'writer', 'influenced', 'Tennessee', 'Williams', 'wanted', 'take', 'small', 'projects', 'make', 'intimate', 'films', 'not', 'blockbusters', ""n't"", 'GODFATHER', 'APOCALYPSE', 'NOW', 'point', 'stand', 'cornerstone', 'allowing', 'do', 'several', 'other', 'less', 'successful', 'smaller', 'projects.Coppola', 'chose', 'brother-in-law', 'David', 'Shire', 'compose', 'music', 'CONVERSATION', 'haunting', 'single', 'piano', 'seemed', 'hit', 'just', 'right', 'emotional', 'timbre', 'then', 'make', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'saxophone', 'player', 'who', 'solo', 'night', 'away', 'was', 'wonderful', 'secondary', 'touch', 'Caul', 'was', 'such', 'cold', 'fish', 'secretive', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'fun', 'hear', 'complete', 'statements', 'coming', 'language', 'jazz', 'interesting', 'name', 'Caul', 'meaning', 'veil', 'membrane', 'face', 'fetus', 'heavy', 'symbolism', 'Coppola', 'stated', 'was', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Antonioni', 'BLOW', 'UP', '1966', 'liked', 'idea', 'director', 'camera', 'was', 'watching', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'listened', 'other', 'characters', 'working', 'mystery', 'was', 'also', 'homage', 'Hitchcock', 'Antonioni', 'shot', 'abstractly', 'characters', 'plastic', 'lot', 'smoked', 'barriers', 'rippled', 'windows', 'pebbled', 'glass', 'incessant', 'appearance', 'Caul', 'god', 'awful', 'clear', 'plastic', 'raincoat.Robert', 'Duvall', 'did', 'uncredited', 'cameo', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'John', 'Cazale', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'did', 'fine', 'work', 'members', 'repertory', 'Allen', 'Garfield', 'did', 'bang', 'up', 'job', 'competing', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'Bernie', 'Moran', 'Garr', 'sweet', 'yet', 'sad', 'cloistered', 'mistress', 'minds', 'white', 'socks', 'short', 'blond', 'locks', 'nice', 'surprise', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'really', 'was', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'non-descript', 'walk', 'Coppola', 'was', 'impressed', 'inventiveness', 'Hackman', 'found', 'Caul', 'character', 'could', 'barely', 'live', 'had', 'difficulty', 'shedding', 'off', 'camera', 'Still', 'best', 'workHaskell', 'Wexler', 'shot', 'big', 'opening', 'sequence', 'park', 'whole', 'surveillance', 'team', 'Then', 'Coppola', 'had', 'artistic', 'difference', 'opinion', 'was', 'replaced', 'Bill', 'Butler', 'who', 'did', 'seamless', 'job', 'rest', 'film', 'Coppola', 'said', 'closed', 'down', 'film', 'four', 'days', 'early', 'was', 'so', 'stressed', 'out', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Caul', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'park', 'midst', 'fog', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'part', 'actual', 'ending', 'film', 'fog', 'machine', 'got', 'hand', 'people', 'complained', 'sending', 'SF', 'police', 'harass', 'team', 'Coppola', 'was', 'faced', 'providing', 'different', 'ending', 'found', 'perfect', 'one', 'Caul', 'last', 'succumbed', 'personal', 'paranoia', 'tearing', 'up', 'apartment', 'looking', 'bug', 'Moran', 'used', 'then', 'sitting', 'exhausted', 'wreckage', 'blowing', 'out', 'pain', 'jazz', 'riffs', 'sax', 'Coppola', 'suggested', 'later', 'bug', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'saxophone', 'strap']",The Conversation

Francis Ford Coppola  wrote and directed this gem between making Godfather and Godfather II and his degree of subtlety and mastery of understatement and jolting events shows.  This film is restored now on a new release and the result is a crisp, flawlessly produced souvenir of just what Coppola does best  - along with his current TETRO.Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a very private person with memories of an incident in his past that permanently scar his ability to trust anyone or anything. He is a private surveillance expert, living in San Francisco, and with his partner Stan (John Cazale) is in the process of taping both audio and visual evidence of an affair of a young couple for a fee of $15,000. for tapes and photos. In studying his tapes he discovers a planned murder and his tension mounts as he realizes he could be considered a participant in a killing not unlike what happened in his past.  He becomes paranoid when he attempts to turn over the achieved evidence to the man who hired him and in turn finds he is to give the tapes and photos to an 'assistant', one Martin Stett (Harrison Ford in a very early bit part).  Fear consumes him: he distances himself from his girlfriend (Teri Garr) and loses his partner Stan when his obsession with personal privacy drives Stan away.  Gaul, well respected in his field, meets his New York counterpart and becomes part of a surveillance scheme himself!  How Gaul copes with his situation is the resolution of the film.The pace of the film is slow, not unlike the patience required by those who invade the privacy of others.  Coppola allows us to understand the psyches of  each of his characters, no matter how small their roles.  Hackman and Cazale are superb as they keep the flow of the film tense like a drawn out tightrope.  It is a film to see repeatedly and one that has many of the qualities Coppola polishes in TETRO.

521788,A1158PJX6NEVU0,B00003CX9I,HighExpectations,"[1, 1]","I disagree with my fellow film buffs who would rank this as a film that echoes the warnings of George Orwell's novel ""1984."" Of course, this is a movie about listening, and yes, the government is portrayed as an omnipresent ghoul with easy access to your most intimate thoughts. Dare to conjure a thought that threatens the government and you just might disappear. Yes. The film suggests all of this. But that, in my humble opinion, is not what the film is about. Instead, I suggest that the Orwellian aspects are merely the skeleton on which is hung a more personal tale about the difference between hearing and listening, and a man who's deaf to the difference.Can there be any doubt this is the case when one of the first images we see is that of a mime -- the antithesis of Harry Caul, who is the film's protagonist. The mere notion of Harry deciphering the movements of a mime is laughable because to do so would require an understanding of subtext and insight into the human condition. Harry has neither. Harry can observe, but he doesn't see. Upon seeing a mime rub his eyes and shrug his shoulders we can reasonably assume that Harry would report that the mime rubbed his eyes and shrugged his shoulders. That this is a mime's way of saying he's sad would be completely lost on Harry.As Harry Caul tells us very early in the film: ""I don't care what they're talking about. All I want is a nice, fat recording.""As we come to find, however, Harry can't sustain this kind of life.He says he doesn't care what's said, and yet he walks the walk of an expert listener. A champion bugger. The top of the heap when it comes to surveillance. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Harry may be the best at hearing. He can ""hear"" any conversation, wherever and whenever it takes place. But listen? No. Harry's a terrible listener.And that's the central conflict of ""The Conversation."" Harry the Hearer vs Harry the Listener.For example: From the moment we meet Harry's unhappy mistress, he's seemingly oblivious to the cause of her unhappiness no matter how plainly she explains it to him. He expects her to be at his beck and caul ... pun intended. He expects her to be satisfied with a life built around the insufficient moments she spends in his company. She's not.Another example: Harry Caul pretends he doesn't care about friendships. That his concern is all business. He severs ties to a long-time associate, then gets upset when he learns that associate is working for the competition. But he's not hurt in an emotional way. Not betrayed as a friend. Supposedly all he cares about is that none of his secrets are stolen.Perhaps the most telling event about Harry occurs early in the film, when he learns his landlady has been snooping in his mail, and that she's been in his apartment without his permission. Harry acts as though this is an abomination. He says the most important thing in the world is that he have the only key to his apartment. But, really, why? There's nothing in the apartment that Harry shows the least bit attachment to, so he can't be worried about being burgled. No one comes to visit him there. He doesn't even bring his mistress there. Instead, he pays the rent on her apartment so that he can see her at her place. Harry acts as if this lonely life of his is so very valuable, and yet we are shown nothing of value in his possession -- no items, no relationships, not so much as a pet.Harry's so worried about being bugged that he never seems to realize that he never says anything anyone would want to hear. He's the loneliest, most boring man on the planet.Indeed, the one time he's aware he's been bugged as a prank, he's simply embarrassed that it caught him in a rare expression of emotion.""The Conversation"" is brilliant storytelling, the subtle story of a man who's life of detachment and denial is about to come crashing down. It's about human interaction, and the danger that results when a life lacks those kind of critical connections. It's about how much people need each other to get through life. It's about the difference between hearing and listening.How many different ways can you say ""He'd kill us if he had the chance?"" This is the lovely little riddle of this movie and it's played to perfection. He'd kill US if he had the chance. HE'D kill us if he had the chance. Where's the emphasis? What's the subtext? Is the mime happy? Is the mime sad? Harry just might be driven mad as he struggles to figure it out.",5,"A Brilliant Movie, Less Orwellian Than Some Think",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,4445,"['disagree', 'fellow', 'film', 'buffs', 'who', 'would', 'rank', 'film', 'warnings', 'George', 'Orwell', 'novel', '1984', 'course', 'movie', 'listening', 'yes', 'government', 'portrayed', 'omnipresent', 'ghoul', 'easy', 'access', 'most', 'intimate', 'thoughts', 'Dare', 'conjure', 'thought', 'government', 'just', 'might', 'disappear', 'Yes', 'film', 'humble', 'opinion', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'Instead', 'suggest', 'Orwellian', 'aspects', 'are', 'merely', 'skeleton', 'more', 'personal', 'tale', 'difference', 'hearing', 'listening', 'man', 'who', 'deaf', 'difference.Can', 'there', 'be', 'doubt', 'case', 'when', 'one', 'first', 'see', 'mime', 'antithesis', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'who', 'film', 'protagonist', 'mere', 'notion', 'Harry', 'deciphering', 'movements', 'mime', 'laughable', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'require', 'understanding', 'subtext', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'Harry', 'neither', 'Harry', 'can', 'observe', ""n't"", 'see', 'seeing', 'mime', 'rub', 'eyes', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'can', 'reasonably', 'assume', 'Harry', 'would', 'report', 'mime', 'rubbed', 'eyes', 'shrugged', 'shoulders', 'mime', 'way', 'saying', 'sad', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'lost', 'Harry.As', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'very', 'early', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', ""'re"", 'talking', 'want', 'nice', 'fat', 'recording', 'come', 'find', 'however', 'Harry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sustain', 'kind', 'life.He', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'said', 'yet', 'walk', 'expert', 'listener', 'champion', 'bugger', 'top', 'heap', 'when', 'surveillance', 'Wrong', 'Wrong', 'Wrong', 'Harry', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'hearing', 'can', 'hear', 'conversation', 'wherever', 'whenever', 'place', 'listen', 'No', 'Harry', 'terrible', 'listener.And', 'central', 'conflict', 'Conversation', 'Hearer', 'vs', 'Harry', 'Listener.For', 'example', 'moment', 'meet', 'Harry', 'unhappy', 'mistress', 'seemingly', 'oblivious', 'cause', 'unhappiness', 'matter', 'how', 'plainly', 'be', 'beck', 'caul', 'pun', 'intended', 'be', 'satisfied', 'life', 'built', 'insufficient', 'company', 'not.Another', 'example', 'Harry', 'Caul', ""n't"", 'care', 'friendships', 'concern', 'business', 'ties', 'long-time', 'associate', 'then', 'upset', 'when', 'associate', 'working', 'competition', 'not', 'hurt', 'emotional', 'way', 'Not', 'betrayed', 'friend', 'Supposedly', 'about', 'none', 'secrets', 'are', 'stolen.Perhaps', 'most', 'telling', 'event', 'Harry', 'early', 'film', 'when', 'landlady', 'been', 'snooping', 'mail', 'been', 'apartment', 'permission', 'Harry', 'abomination', 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'world', 'have', 'only', 'key', 'apartment', 'really', 'why', 'nothing', 'apartment', 'Harry', 'least', 'bit', 'attachment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'worried', 'being', 'burgled', 'one', 'visit', 'there', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'mistress', 'there', 'Instead', 'rent', 'apartment', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'place', 'Harry', 'lonely', 'life', 'so', 'very', 'valuable', 'yet', 'are', 'shown', 'nothing', 'value', 'possession', 'items', 'relationships', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'pet.Harry', 'so', 'worried', 'being', 'bugged', 'never', 'realize', 'never', 'anything', 'anyone', 'would', 'want', 'hear', 'loneliest', 'most', 'boring', 'man', 'planet.Indeed', 'one', 'time', 'aware', 'been', 'bugged', 'prank', 'simply', 'embarrassed', 'caught', 'rare', 'expression', 'emotion', 'Conversation', 'brilliant', 'storytelling', 'subtle', 'story', 'man', 'who', 'life', 'detachment', 'denial', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'human', 'interaction', 'danger', 'results', 'when', 'life', 'kind', 'critical', 'connections', 'how', 'much', 'people', 'need', 'other', 'get', 'life', 'difference', 'hearing', 'listening.How', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'can', 'say', ""'d"", 'kill', 'had', 'chance', 'lovely', 'little', 'riddle', 'movie', 'played', 'perfection', ""'d"", 'kill', 'US', 'had', 'chance', 'HE', ""'D"", 'kill', 'had', 'chance', 'Where', 'emphasis', 'What', 'subtext', 'mime', 'happy', 'mime', 'sad', 'Harry', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'driven', 'mad', 'figure', 'out']",The Conversation

He has no real life of his own, he just spies on real lives for his own gain. He just does a job, it's the people who hire him who are responsible for what is done with the knowledge he gives them. All of this changes on his latest job, as he begins to suspect that the young couple he is asked to tape is being set up to be killed. From the first shot to the last heartbreaking, but logical shot Hackman owns this spellbinding movie about paranoia and personal liberties being taken from you.

521808,A1MCGG7A9G93YI,B00003CX9I,John Galvin,"[0, 2]","Harry Caul is an expert in the field of electronic surveillance. He has been hired by the director of a large corporation to record a conversation between his wife and another man. It is no easy feat. The conversation will occur in a noisy public place. The targets know they may be watched. They speak low, allusively and are forever in motion. Caul, his assistant Stan and two students borrowed from the AV department of a nearby university tape the conversation with but three pickups: a mic planted in the shopping bag of a man following the couple and two parabolic microphones mounted with cross-hairs from atop surrounding buildings. Later, and further to his expertise, Harry will sit at a bench in his workshop with four tape players and will slowly begin to cut and mix the recordings into an intelligible, uninterrupted run of speech--a conversation, the conversation.The story owes a little something to Antonioni's Blow Up (in which a photographer tries to decipher a tale seemingly told in a series of grainy, blown-up photographs) and the character of Harry Caul may be a descendent of Kafka's harassed tribe of persecuted everymen. Harry knows both too much and too little; he is an expert and an innocent. He can tape anyone anywhere and lift the fuzz of ambient noise and extraneous voicings from the most impossibly difficult mixes; but Harry lives at a remove, at a distance from the world on which he spies. His experience of the world outside his lab is always mediated through some mechanical filter: a microphone, a camera lens, undiscriminating magnetic tape. They stand between Harry and love, friendship, compassion--between Harry and involvement in what he considers a dangerous blur of unprofessional inquiry.But the conversation he has deciphered has ended on an unexpected and jarring note. It pricks his conscience and Harry suddenly sees his targets as people and finds himself obliged to decipher meanings, feelings and emotive codes with which he is studiously unfamiliar. Harry isn't sure what he knows about the couple and their impending dilemma, but he knows too much about the inner-workings and the underpinnings of a world where knowledge is invasion. Harry finally decides to intervene, to act to help the couple. And this harrowing, climactic scene shows Harry once again employing an unrivaled expertise in the pursuit of information that he is ill-equipped to interpret. The result is the ultimate discovery that he was never at any real remove from the world--it was always watching him and with a skill far surpassing his own. It is a revelation with which Harry cannot live peaceably and dooms him to his obsessive and ultimately paralyzing paranoia in what is, perhaps, the most haunting conclusion in cinematic history.I hope you will take my word for it when I tell you that this is Francis Ford Coppola's finest work--spare, focused, minimalist direction, perfectly complementing a singularly deep, rich charge of narrative.

521809,A1F6DHVFE1ZIXX,B00003CX9I,John,"[9, 9]","This is not a movie that you might expect from Francis Ford Coppola.  That is, not unless you've seen something by him besides the Godfathers and Apocalypse Now.  It is a very Hitchcockian tale of a paranoid man's descent into madness.Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is the world's greatest serveilance expert.  It is through one of his ""jobs"" for someone that he makes his descent.  I don't really want to say more than that about the plot, because it is way better if you see it without knowing anything about it (and if you intend to do that, stop reading reviews after mine, because the ones below mine reveal spoilers).That said, this movie has a great cast.  Gene Hackman is brilliant.  He is not his usual, overly energetic, constantly yelling self in this movie.  He plays the role subtlely, which is perfect to show Harry's shy, inward personality.  Harry is, because of his paranioa, very much the loner, and Hackman's usual acting just wouldn't fit in here.  He positively nails this role.Let's not forget the supporting actors.  John Cazale (an underrated actor and one of my person favorites)plays Harry's employee in the serveilance firm, Robert Duvall plays the guy who hires Harry for the job that eventually sends him into madness, Harrison Ford (I love the way he acts in FFC's movies (see Apocalypse Now), he is completely different from all his other roles.  He is cold and ruthless in this-none of that sarcastic wit and quick grin here) plays Duvall's employee, and Cindy Williams plays one of the people who Harry is hired to watch.  They are all excellent.  I thought that it would be hard believing Cindy Williams in a role such as this because of her days on Laverne and Shirley, but she pulls it off wonderfully.Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant writer.  Almost every movie that he has written has been a masterpiece.  This oft-overlooked gem is no exception.  His script (like Hackman's acting) has a subtlety that perfectly fits with the main character's personality.  He really is showing his talent with this movie.  Why Francis felt that he should stop making good movies in the 90's (e.g. Jack, The Rainmaker (a good movie, but nothing of this caliber), Peggy Sue Got Married, etc) is beyond me.  Maybe he (God forbid) lost his touch or something.  I sure hope not.  Francis, make something good again!  Your ""good"" is the equivalent of everyone else's ""once in a lifetime masterpiece"".  Maybe it's because everytime he tries to make something good, he gets screwed (e.g. Apocalypse Now (money trouble) and the Godfather (studio trouble)).  Oh well, who knows.I got a little off track there, but my mind often wonders...  Anyway, this movie is definately one of those that you can't miss.  If you like Taxi Driver, this is a less violent version.  That's the closest comparision I can think of to give you an idea of what this movie's about.  Even though saying this won't convince you (yeah, I read your ""rules"" Mike Stone, and if you're allowed to break them, I'm allowed to break them), I must say it anyway:  Highly recommended.

II."" It's a mystery-drama, that plays like a horror movie similar to the Nicolas Roeg film ""Don't Look Now"" in the sense that works with dread, rather than fright. Two-time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul, a wiretapper whom we first meet as he's recording a conversation between a young couple in a park. Caul sees his job as a job, he doesn't get involved with the people he records nor does he pay much attention to the details of the conversation. He's supposed to record it and deliver it. His suspicions begin to grow about the tape when he tries to personally deliver it the mysterious person who asked for it and is instead badgered by the man's assistant (Harrison Ford) for it. At the same time we begin to realize how bad Caul is at his job. His partner Stanley (John Cazale) has quit and has already began working for another wiretapper. The superintendent at his apartment building has managed to get inside his multi-locked apartment to drop off a birthday present. A ladyfriend of his tells Harry about a time she watched his spying on someone for an hour...It's no wonder that when a rival wiretapper comes to his office with him he manages to record an intimant conversation between Harry and a woman. While the mystery revolving around ""the conversation"" continues, Harry begins deciphering some of the sentences and his suspicions are confirmed when he hears the sentence: ""He'd kill us if he got the chance?"" This question fuels the rest of the movie, until the very creepy and superb climax. Some of the most haunting parts of the film come at the end and this is due to the visuals of the film. One much-talked about scene comes when Harry flushes a toilet in a motel room and it begins overflowing with blood. This scene (and the few that follow it) are some of the most effectively creepy scenes I've seen in a long time. Gene Hackman is superb as Harry Caul, a multi-layered character that on the page must have seemed very one-dimensional. Harry is a man with no personal life, almost no friends, and he's a man that lives shrouded in mystery. Coppola had already proved by the time this movie came out that he was a cinematic genius, but he's mostly known for movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" Those films are 3 hour long epic films, but I think to really see how much range Coppola has as a director it's nice to take a look at ""The Conversation."" Few people have seen this movie, it's a much smaller scale film that most of his movies but it's truly a masterwork. Great acting, great direction, great art direction, and great cinematography.GRADE: A",5,A Fantastic Little-Seen Masterpiece,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2742,"['Conversation', 'little', 'seen', 'masterpiece', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'made', 'Godfather', 'Godfather', 'Pt', 'II', 'mystery-drama', 'horror', 'movie', 'similar', 'Nicolas', 'Roeg', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'sense', 'dread', 'rather', 'fright', 'Two-time', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'wiretapper', 'whom', 'first', 'meet', 'recording', 'conversation', 'young', 'couple', 'park', 'Caul', 'job', 'job', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'people', 'pay', 'much', 'attention', 'details', 'conversation', 'supposed', 'record', 'deliver', 'suspicions', 'begin', 'grow', 'tape', 'when', 'personally', 'deliver', 'mysterious', 'person', 'who', 'asked', 'instead', 'badgered', 'man', 'assistant', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'same', 'time', 'begin', 'realize', 'how', 'bad', 'Caul', 'job', 'partner', 'Stanley', 'John', 'Cazale', 'quit', 'already', 'began', 'working', 'wiretapper', 'superintendent', 'apartment', 'building', 'managed', 'get', 'multi-locked', 'apartment', 'drop', 'off', 'birthday', 'present', 'ladyfriend', 'tells', 'Harry', 'time', 'watched', 'spying', 'someone', 'hour', 'wonder', 'when', 'rival', 'wiretapper', 'office', 'record', 'intimant', 'conversation', 'Harry', 'woman', 'mystery', 'revolving', 'conversation', 'Harry', 'deciphering', 'sentences', 'suspicions', 'are', 'confirmed', 'when', 'sentence', ""'d"", 'kill', 'got', 'chance', 'question', 'rest', 'movie', 'very', 'creepy', 'superb', 'climax', 'most', 'haunting', 'parts', 'film', 'come', 'end', 'due', 'visuals', 'film', 'One', 'much-talked', 'scene', 'when', 'Harry', 'toilet', 'motel', 'room', 'overflowing', 'blood', 'scene', 'few', 'follow', 'are', 'most', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'superb', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'multi-layered', 'character', 'page', 'must', 'have', 'seemed', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'Harry', 'man', 'personal', 'life', 'almost', 'friends', 'man', 'shrouded', 'mystery', 'Coppola', 'had', 'already', 'proved', 'time', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'cinematic', 'genius', 'mostly', 'known', 'movies', 'Godfather', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'films', 'are', '3', 'hour', 'long', 'epic', 'films', 'think', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'range', 'Coppola', 'director', 'nice', 'take', 'look', 'Conversation', 'Few', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'much', 'smaller', 'scale', 'film', 'most', 'movies', 'truly', 'masterwork', 'Great', 'acting', 'great', 'direction', 'great', 'art', 'direction', 'great', 'cinematography.GRADE']",The Conversation

521815,A1KT1GWCW8F80,B00003CX9I,K. Gittins,"[1, 4]","""The Conversation"" is director Francis Ford Coppola's film made after ""The Godfather"". It stars Gene Hackman, whose previous movie was the Oscar winning ""The French Connection"".The movie is entirely focussed on Gene Hackman's character, ""Harry Caul"", who is a professional eavesdropper, and the conversation he and his assistants have surreptitiously recorded between Cindy Williams of ""Lavern and Shirley"" fame, and Frederic Forrest, who subsequently plays ""Chef"" in ""Apocalyse, Now"".Although the first few minutes makes us think this is some kind of whodunnit thriller, which it is ultimately is, it also becomes a psychological drama. After listening to the tapes, Harry thinks it's just a boring conversation without significance, and turns it in to the client's assistant, Harrison Ford (""Indiana Jones""), who warns Harry not to get involved because the tapes have dangerous information in it. Harry is now suspicious and takes the tapes back.Harry now re-analyzes the tapes using homemade equipment, and discovers a line of dialog that was covered up by music in the original recording. He continues to analyze it, but his interpretation is wrong, believing someone might have died as a result of his work.FF Coppola, in his commentary, informs us some of the inspiration for the movie came from the famous movie ""Blow Up"", in which a photographer believes he has discovered a murder accidentally captured in his pictures at a park. In ""The Conversation"", the visual photograph is replaced by the audio conversation. (I only gave ""Blow Up"" 1 star, and felt it was tedious, and silly in many parts).The movie now is mostly about Harry, who is a very suspicious loner (4 locks on his door), apparently has no personal belongings other than a stereo, saxophone and some trinkets including a plastic Virgin Mary figurine. He has no car, and an unlisted phone number. He wears a grey translucent raincoat, even on nice days. He does have some interaction with other eavesdroppers and goes to an eavesdropper's trade show (a real event), but has few friends (he even loses his lady friend). He is now consumed by the tape which gets him in to trouble with Harrison Ford and the actual client, played by Robert Duvall. They steal the tapes back from Harry's office, but pay off Harry with $15,000.The final scene is amazing.

Harrison Ford appears the helper of a corporate executive who has hired the surveillance of the couple.  He appears to be the woman's husband played by Cindy Williams.  The executive is Robert Duvall.  With all these actors and a very sparse, tight story, the film feels claustrophobic and slow.  The story can be confusing simply because none of the characters are open and honest and live in secrecy.  Harry becomes obsessed with tape he has made and the woman whose conversation he has taped and fears for her life.  He is fearful and shy, but becomes indirectly involved in trying to find out the situation and if there will be a murder because of his work.

Both have some of our best talent in their younger years, both have that same cinema verite spirit of just letting the scene go on, even if some find it boring or uncomfortable, and both of them seem to have been made on a shoestring budget.  Where Scorcese scores just a little bit higher, for me, is that I feel he incorporates the music into Mean Streets more, and has a few more threads and subplots to keep our attention.  I think part of the reason some may find this movie boring is that essentially the Hackman character is the film - we don't really care about the other people in the surveillance business (they seem like pompous jerks), nor do the young couple in the park really seem that interesting.  (The exception is the John Cazale character, who is more sympathetic and human).  Hackman is superb, however, and we find in his character a man who has learned the hard way to mind his own business and shut himself off from the rest of the world - but of course, his humanity gets the better of him. One aspect of the movie that I find interesting is that it would appear he was right in his paranoia - if it is true that he is not necessarily happy at the beginning of the movie, he is a miserable shambles of a man at the end.  This is a good movie, with a great performance by Hackman, and some pretty good bonus features.

521827,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00003CX9I,Mark Turner,"[2, 2]","In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION.Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work.But the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched.As the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer.When he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen.Going to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment.Eventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out.Still concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him.When he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO.The film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many.Hackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothing more than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar.While the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan.

521830,ANMYHR7THQY1,B00003CX9I,Michael Sherrer,"[1, 3]","This is an excellent piece of filmaking. Very, very underated to date although many of the Amazon posts catch this piece of story telling. Like the parallel editing sequence that MADE the end of Godfather 1, really kill (pardon the pun) at least according to Robert Evans (The Kid Stays in the Picture)-it is interesting to note that this particular new editor of &quot;The Conversation&quot;-contributed alot of great ideas to the story as well as working on the sound mixing. FFC was off working on Godfather II, so perhaps the Editor has a little more freedom and time to work his magic. Funny-most of the workers of the young studio were non-union so he could not even be credited as a picture or sound Editor. Famous Director of Photography Haskell Wexler was &quot;let go&quot; by Francis very early on and replaced. This action gave the film a superior look, for the theme of the film. You have to love the retro vibe of all that electronic tape gear in the digital age we now live. The visual look is crisp and stunning. If you view this DVD-watch BOTH commentaries. The haunting piano melody over the DVD Menu and that appears throughout the story-is worth appreciation alone. I actually sat down and counted out both sets of machine gun triplets in what is a rather dreamy piece of solo piano. As many have said already-this belongs in your DVD library. And let's not forget the early work here of Harrison Ford-complete with scar on his chin; Cindy Williams; Robert Duvall and Teri Garr. Enjoy and relish. People ARE watching and listening.

521831,A27PSZX2SE0B51,B00003CX9I,Mike Stone,"[5, 8]","For a movie with a reputation as an unseen masterpiece, &quot;The Conversation&quot; is somewhat flawed; there are facets of it that appear quite amateurish.  On the other hand, there's even more that's spellbinding and mind bending and awe inspiring.Let's start with the cons.  Francis Ford Coppola, as screenwriter, fills his story with a lot of obvious psychology.  He makes a point of having Harry Caul pick up a piece of trash, on an otherwise spic and span path, before a late night rendezvous in a lady friend's apartment (he's meticulous, but he's also dirty!).  We see Harry open an intricate system of three locks before he enters his apartment (he's paranoid!).  And when we see the inside of said apartment, it's barely furnished, except for the essential amenities (he's empty on the inside, too!).  The visual imagery that Coppola utilizes feels equally contrived.  Harry has an ever-present overcoat; only it's so thin and diaphanous that its main function -- to hide Harry from the outside world -- is not served.  This dovetails nicely with his surname, which also tries to serve the same function, unsuccessfully.Okay, the above seems like nitpicking to me.  They're things that jumped out at me while watching the movie, things that a subtler screenwriter (nobody ever accused Coppola of being subtle) would have hidden better.  Not that they distract from the brilliance that is the rest of the movie.Tops on the list of brilliant things here is, of course, Gene Hackman as Harry Caul.  One of our best actors, Hackman is usually asked to chew scenery, provide charisma, and pump up a film's energy.  Here, he does none of that.  I've mentioned before how some of my favourite film performances involve an actor known for his energy having it forcibly bottled up (see Billy Bob Thornton in &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot;).  Hackman shows how this is done best.He is terrific when showing us Harry's social ineptitude.  When in the company of other surveillance technicians, Harry is quiet.  He knows that everything he says will have gravity, seeing as he's the top man in the business.  He doesn't need to say much, while still standing out.  But when he's with civilians, his shyness, awkwardness, and clumsiness burst to the forefront.  Hackman slithers back and forth between these two of Harry's personas with such skill and precision, you're liable to forget you're watching a movie.  The performance feels like you're spying on an unsuspecting subject.Coppola, as screenwriter (again), does some things right.  He's created a Hitchcockian thriller, only more psychological than Hitchcock ever got.  Sure, there's the aspect of the movie that involves human deviousness, and the audience is engaged in trying to solve a dangerous mystery.  But that's just a starting point.  Listen: the people Harry works for, and the people he's spying on, are all MacGuffins.  They appear, at first glance, to be integral to what the movie is about.  Actually, the movie is about the inner torment of a paranoid and lonely man.  The rest is just window dressing.  Skilled window dressing, but inconsequential nonetheless.Coppola, as director, is a magician here.  He's at his best when showing us how Harry puts a surveillance tape together.  He's been contracted to tape the conversation of the film's title, which will take place in a crowded quad.  In order to get it, Harry uses four different microphones at four different stations.  Coppola shows us the quad scene many times from many different angles, as we follow along with Harry to try and find the best angle to listen from.  It's one man's Rashomon.  The film is fascinating to watch in these scenes, as we are privy to the machinations of the buggers at work.Complementary in these scenes is the brilliant work of the film's sound team.  They have created a sounds cape that is developed perfectly, where layer upon layer of noise is filtered away until the information is slowly revealed.  Don't you dare watch this movie with anything less than a quality sound system, or half the accomplishment will lost.&quot;The Conversation&quot; moves slowly but assuredly.  It is more an impressive achievement than an entertaining one.  Still, for the paranoid cineaste, you can't do much better.",4,Harry Bugger,1009929600,"01 2, 2002",2002,4271,"['movie', 'reputation', 'unseen', 'masterpiece', 'quot', 'Conversation', 'quot', 'somewhat', 'flawed', 'are', 'facets', 'appear', 'quite', 'amateurish', 'other', 'hand', 'even', 'more', 'spellbinding', 'mind', 'bending', 'awe', 'inspiring.Let', 'start', 'cons', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'screenwriter', 'story', 'lot', 'obvious', 'psychology', 'point', 'having', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'pick', 'up', 'piece', 'trash', 'otherwise', 'spic', 'span', 'path', 'late', 'night', 'rendezvous', 'lady', 'friend', 'apartment', 'meticulous', 'also', 'dirty', 'see', 'Harry', 'open', 'intricate', 'system', 'three', 'locks', 'apartment', 'paranoid', 'when', 'see', 'inside', 'said', 'apartment', 'barely', 'furnished', 'essential', 'amenities', 'empty', 'inside', 'too', 'visual', 'imagery', 'Coppola', 'utilizes', 'feels', 'equally', 'contrived', 'Harry', 'ever-present', 'overcoat', 'only', 'so', 'thin', 'diaphanous', 'main', 'function', 'hide', 'Harry', 'outside', 'world', 'not', 'served', 'nicely', 'surname', 'also', 'serve', 'same', 'function', 'unsuccessfully.Okay', 'above', 'nitpicking', ""'re"", 'things', 'jumped', 'out', 'watching', 'movie', 'things', 'subtler', 'screenwriter', 'nobody', 'ever', 'accused', 'Coppola', 'being', 'subtle', 'would', 'have', 'hidden', 'better', 'Not', 'distract', 'brilliance', 'rest', 'movie.Tops', 'list', 'brilliant', 'things', 'here', 'course', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'One', 'best', 'actors', 'Hackman', 'usually', 'asked', 'chew', 'scenery', 'provide', 'charisma', 'pump', 'up', 'film', 'energy', 'Here', 'none', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', 'how', 'favourite', 'film', 'performances', 'involve', 'actor', 'known', 'energy', 'having', 'forcibly', 'bottled', 'up', 'see', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'quot', 'Man', 'Who', 'Was', ""n't"", 'quot', 'Hackman', 'how', 'done', 'best.He', 'terrific', 'when', 'showing', 'Harry', 'social', 'ineptitude', 'When', 'company', 'other', 'surveillance', 'technicians', 'Harry', 'quiet', 'everything', 'will', 'have', 'gravity', 'seeing', 'top', 'man', 'business', ""n't"", 'need', 'say', 'much', 'still', 'standing', 'out', 'when', 'civilians', 'shyness', 'awkwardness', 'clumsiness', 'burst', 'forefront', 'Hackman', 'back', 'forth', 'two', 'Harry', 'personas', 'such', 'skill', 'precision', ""'re"", 'liable', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'movie', 'performance', 'feels', ""'re"", 'spying', 'unsuspecting', 'subject.Coppola', 'screenwriter', 'again', 'things', 'right', 'created', 'Hitchcockian', 'thriller', 'only', 'more', 'psychological', 'Hitchcock', 'ever', 'got', 'Sure', 'aspect', 'movie', 'human', 'deviousness', 'audience', 'engaged', 'trying', 'solve', 'dangerous', 'mystery', 'just', 'starting', 'point', 'Listen', 'people', 'Harry', 'people', 'spying', 'are', 'MacGuffins', 'appear', 'first', 'glance', 'be', 'integral', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'Actually', 'movie', 'inner', 'torment', 'paranoid', 'lonely', 'man', 'rest', 'just', 'window', 'dressing', 'Skilled', 'window', 'dressing', 'inconsequential', 'nonetheless.Coppola', 'director', 'magician', 'here', 'best', 'when', 'showing', 'how', 'Harry', 'surveillance', 'tape', 'together', 'been', 'contracted', 'tape', 'conversation', 'film', 'title', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'crowded', 'quad', 'order', 'get', 'Harry', 'four', 'different', 'microphones', 'four', 'different', 'stations', 'Coppola', 'quad', 'scene', 'many', 'times', 'many', 'different', 'angles', 'follow', 'along', 'Harry', 'try', 'find', 'best', 'angle', 'listen', 'one', 'man', 'Rashomon', 'film', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'scenes', 'are', 'privy', 'machinations', 'buggers', 'work.Complementary', 'scenes', 'brilliant', 'work', 'film', 'sound', 'team', 'have', 'created', 'sounds', 'cape', 'developed', 'perfectly', 'where', 'layer', 'layer', 'noise', 'filtered', 'away', 'information', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dare', 'watch', 'movie', 'anything', 'less', 'quality', 'sound', 'system', 'accomplishment', 'will', 'lost.', 'quot', 'Conversation', 'quot', 'slowly', 'assuredly', 'more', 'impressive', 'achievement', 'entertaining', 'one', 'Still', 'paranoid', 'cineaste', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'better']",The Conversation

This one has easily been in my top ten since I saw it for the first time thirty some years ago; it will always remain there. Coppola's brilliance is astonishing. This is a perfect movie, certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. Why? It deals with a deeply flawed but brilliant man who makes the mistake of beginning to care about people, which, in a sense, could become his redemption. But we don't really know. The movie is wonderfully enigmatic, understated, documentary-like at times. You have to listen carefully and to think; Coppola resists hitting you over the head to make a point. Gene Hackman in his greatest role, by far. The late John Cazale in a typically riveting performance (how's that for a filmography for John C: The Deerhunter, The Godfather Saga, Dog Day Afternoon, The Conversation: not too shabby, eh?)! The great Alan Garfield (now Gurwitz) as the ""best bugger on the east coast"".

521834,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B00003CX9I,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[3, 5]","After the success of the first Godfather picture, Francis Ford Coppola could do anything he wanted.  He chose a very loose adaptation from the leading character and basic scenario of Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow-up, to create this both exciting and provocative thriller about a surveillance specialist who finds himself involved in a murder plot.In Blow-up, a fashion photographer takes a picture in the park and comes to believe that he may have evidence of a murder.  The difficulty is that the visual evidence is not conclusive -- it demands interpretation and no amount of manipulation can overcome the ambiguity of the image.  Here, Harry Caul uses elaborate techniques to record and collect fragments from what seems to be an innocuous conversation, but that he begins to suspect will be used in a murder plot.Just as Blow-up became not only a film about a photographer and a murderer but also a meditation on vision and on the cinema -- so The Conversation is a rich and sophisticated film about the nature of sound and the interpretation of sound and in particular about the way in which sound is captured for film.  Apart from having an excellent jazz soundtrack, the film is very subtle in its sound editing.It opens on a crowded park, and we immediately become aware that the sound of the crowds and the music and the individual people and the cars is recorded sound.  We hear the subtle distortions that come from blowing up sound recorded from a distance, and that in a finished soundtrack would be removed.  It turns out we are both watching the crowd and watching and listening in as a couple in the crowd is being recorded through a number of highly specialized surveillance techniques.  Later in the film, we are reminded at several points and in several ways that the sound in a film is an artificial construction and that it is independent of the visuals.  Some scenes that initially seem like they are part of the normal exegesis of the film, turn out to be reconstructions based on how certain characters heard and interpreted recorded sound; in other scenes the aural artifacts we have become familiar with show up to indicate that we can never be sure whether the sound is just part of the film or whether it is being recorded by a third party.This is an excellent film on a number of levels, as a political thriller, as a portrait of a paranoid individual, but also as a meditation on the nature of sound in film.  Definitely one to watch ... and listen to.",4,The epistemology of sound -- jazz and reverberation,1204675200,"03 5, 2008",2008,2482,"['success', 'first', 'Godfather', 'picture', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'could', 'do', 'anything', 'wanted', 'chose', 'very', 'loose', 'adaptation', 'leading', 'character', 'basic', 'scenario', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'Blow-up', 'create', 'exciting', 'provocative', 'thriller', 'surveillance', 'specialist', 'who', 'involved', 'murder', 'plot.In', 'Blow-up', 'fashion', 'photographer', 'picture', 'park', 'believe', 'may', 'have', 'evidence', 'murder', 'difficulty', 'visual', 'evidence', 'not', 'conclusive', 'interpretation', 'amount', 'manipulation', 'can', 'overcome', 'ambiguity', 'image', 'Here', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'elaborate', 'techniques', 'record', 'collect', 'fragments', 'what', 'be', 'innocuous', 'conversation', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'murder', 'plot.Just', 'Blow-up', 'became', 'not', 'only', 'film', 'photographer', 'murderer', 'also', 'meditation', 'vision', 'cinema', 'Conversation', 'rich', 'sophisticated', 'film', 'nature', 'sound', 'interpretation', 'sound', 'particular', 'way', 'sound', 'captured', 'film', 'Apart', 'having', 'excellent', 'jazz', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'very', 'subtle', 'sound', 'editing.It', 'crowded', 'park', 'immediately', 'become', 'aware', 'sound', 'crowds', 'music', 'individual', 'people', 'cars', 'recorded', 'sound', 'hear', 'subtle', 'distortions', 'come', 'blowing', 'up', 'sound', 'recorded', 'distance', 'finished', 'soundtrack', 'would', 'be', 'removed', 'out', 'are', 'watching', 'crowd', 'watching', 'listening', 'couple', 'crowd', 'being', 'recorded', 'number', 'highly', 'specialized', 'surveillance', 'techniques', 'Later', 'film', 'are', 'reminded', 'several', 'points', 'several', 'ways', 'sound', 'film', 'artificial', 'construction', 'independent', 'visuals', 'scenes', 'initially', 'seem', 'are', 'part', 'normal', 'exegesis', 'film', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'reconstructions', 'based', 'how', 'certain', 'characters', 'heard', 'interpreted', 'recorded', 'sound', 'other', 'scenes', 'aural', 'artifacts', 'have', 'become', 'familiar', 'show', 'up', 'indicate', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'sure', 'sound', 'just', 'part', 'film', 'being', 'recorded', 'third', 'party.This', 'excellent', 'film', 'number', 'levels', 'political', 'thriller', 'portrait', 'paranoid', 'individual', 'also', 'meditation', 'nature', 'sound', 'film', 'Definitely', 'one', 'watch', 'listen']",The Conversation

The film is an allegory for the Watergate situation that was overtaking the country, with all the taping and eavesdropping of conversations.  Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul who is the best in the business.  One the reasons is his ability to stay detached from the situation.  He had even taped conversations regarding murders, but it never bothered him.  He then for some reason becomes involved in a situation involving a young couple.  We see the normally cool and collected Harry becomes unraveled.

In this 1974 film written and directed by Francis Fird Coppola, he rises to the level of greatness.Harry, played by Gene Hackman works in the surveillance industry, and is said to be the best at his kind of job. However, on one job a woman and little girl were killed after one of his jobs, and he tried to distance himself by saying he was in no way responsible. Harry is a clever man, very quiet and a loner. in fact his girlfriend, Teri Garr, before a nose job, did not know where he lived or what he did for work.

521843,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B00003CX9I,"Promise ""promise""","[0, 0]","This is a very fine, original work by a wonderful director.It's a story about the issue of privacy invasion which was ironically filmed just as the Watergate break-in was front page news.  More than that, it's the story of one man, Harry Caul, a master ""bugger,"" a terribly damaged soul, who is practially isolated  from real life and who now lives mostly for his work. He tries, in his stiff and stilted way, to have a personal life;he has a girlfriend of sorts, a sweet but pathetic young woman whom he supports in a shabby room.  He tries to join in the post-convention party, has a few drinks, dances with a callgirl but even that sad attempt at human contact ends up in disaster.The story is brilliantly told, giving us, the audience, just enough information to keep our attention riveted to the screen.  We discover, bit by bit, just as Harry does, what is really going on with the young couple who is walking around Union Square.  Harry's credo is that he never gets personally involved in his survelliance work; he just does what he's ordered to do and collects the money.  His assistant, Stan, is a much more human guy and gets interested in the content of the conversation.  ""It's just normal"", he says.  But Harry isn't normal and we see how this particular job breaks open his defenses to the point where he takes direct action out of personal motives.There's so much that's good in this film but there are enough other reviews here that go into detail so I won't. Gene Hackman is wonderful in what must have been a terribly difficult role. The whole cast is very good. I particularly liked the very small but crucial parts played by Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest.  We see the film of them over and over so we get a very good opportunity to look at their facial expressions.  Forrest especially plays his part superbly.  Harrison Ford has another small but very interesting role and he makes the most of it.  Teri Garr is always good, as is John Cazale.I was reminded of a very similar film, made decades later, in Germany, ""The Story of Others"" which won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  In this film, the main character is another single, isolated, middle-aged man, whose profession is to spy on possible traitors to the East German government, during the Cold War.  This man is even more far-gone than the Hackman character; his apartment is infinitely more sterile, and his social life is absolutely nothing.  But, like his American counterpart, one of his assignments has him snooping into the lives of a pair of lovers.  The love expressed in this couple, both of whom are artists and live a colorful, vibrant life, totally unlike that of the spy, makes something click inside his mind which leads to a similar, even more crucial, moral dilemma.I actually liked ""The Lives of Others"" much better than ""The Conversation"" becuase it went much farther and had more heart. I hope that Coppola saw it and I have to wonder what he thought.  I think it's because The Conversation"" doesn't live up to ""The Lives of Others"" that I reluctantly give it only four stars.  I liked it very much but I can't say that I loved it.  For me, the ending didn' work well.  Coppola said that it wasn't the ending he originally wrote but that difficulties in filming made his first ending impossible.  I think the difference in the endings of the two films accounts for why I liked this one but loved the other.",4,"A brilliant, personal work by Coppola",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",2012,3412,"['very', 'fine', 'original', 'work', 'wonderful', 'director.It', 'story', 'issue', 'privacy', 'invasion', 'was', 'ironically', 'filmed', 'just', 'Watergate', 'break-in', 'was', 'front', 'page', 'news', 'More', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'master', 'bugger', 'terribly', 'damaged', 'soul', 'who', 'practially', 'isolated', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'now', 'mostly', 'work', 'stiff', 'stilted', 'way', 'have', 'personal', 'life', 'girlfriend', 'sorts', 'sweet', 'pathetic', 'young', 'woman', 'whom', 'shabby', 'room', 'join', 'post-convention', 'party', 'few', 'drinks', 'dances', 'callgirl', 'even', 'sad', 'attempt', 'human', 'contact', 'up', 'disaster.The', 'story', 'brilliantly', 'told', 'giving', 'audience', 'just', 'enough', 'information', 'keep', 'attention', 'riveted', 'screen', 'discover', 'bit', 'bit', 'just', 'Harry', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'walking', 'Union', 'Square', 'Harry', 'credo', 'never', 'personally', 'involved', 'survelliance', 'work', 'just', 'what', 'ordered', 'do', 'collects', 'money', 'assistant', 'Stan', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'guy', 'interested', 'content', 'conversation', 'just', 'normal', 'Harry', ""n't"", 'normal', 'see', 'how', 'particular', 'job', 'breaks', 'open', 'defenses', 'point', 'where', 'direct', 'action', 'personal', 'motives.There', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'enough', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'go', 'detail', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'wonderful', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'terribly', 'difficult', 'role', 'whole', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'particularly', 'liked', 'very', 'small', 'crucial', 'parts', 'played', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'see', 'film', 'so', 'get', 'very', 'good', 'opportunity', 'look', 'facial', 'expressions', 'Forrest', 'especially', 'part', 'superbly', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'small', 'very', 'interesting', 'role', 'most', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'always', 'good', 'John', 'Cazale.I', 'was', 'reminded', 'very', 'similar', 'film', 'made', 'decades', 'later', 'Germany', 'Story', 'Others', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Foreign', 'Film', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'single', 'isolated', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'profession', 'spy', 'possible', 'traitors', 'East', 'German', 'government', 'Cold', 'War', 'man', 'even', 'more', 'far-gone', 'Hackman', 'character', 'apartment', 'infinitely', 'more', 'sterile', 'social', 'life', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'American', 'counterpart', 'one', 'assignments', 'snooping', 'lives', 'pair', 'lovers', 'love', 'expressed', 'couple', 'whom', 'are', 'artists', 'live', 'colorful', 'vibrant', 'life', 'totally', 'spy', 'something', 'click', 'mind', 'similar', 'even', 'more', 'crucial', 'moral', 'dilemma.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'Lives', 'Others', 'much', 'better', 'Conversation', 'becuase', 'went', 'much', 'farther', 'had', 'more', 'heart', 'hope', 'Coppola', 'saw', 'have', 'wonder', 'what', 'thought', 'think', 'Conversation', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'Lives', 'Others', 'reluctantly', 'give', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'liked', 'very', 'much', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'loved', 'ending', 'didn', 'work', 'well', 'Coppola', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'ending', 'originally', 'wrote', 'difficulties', 'filming', 'made', 'first', 'ending', 'impossible', 'think', 'difference', 'endings', 'two', 'films', 'accounts', 'why', 'liked', 'one', 'loved', 'other']",The Conversation

521846,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00003CX9I,R.A. McKenzie,"[13, 13]","I wasn't alive in 1974, but I can't imagine how strange and alluring ""The Conversation"" must've felt to those who witnessed it when it was first released.  Was the surveillance technology advanced for its time?  Was the culture paranoid of being watched?  Did audiences fully understand the film's undertones at the time?  Did people expect our culture would become even more monitored in the future?I don't really know the answers to those questions, and in a way, I prefer not to when I think about ""The Conversation"".  To Harry Caul, those questions are irrelevant when the story begins.  He truly dedicates his surveillance to making a clear and well-produced record, and tries not to listen to the content.  He sees his work as a way to record ""sound"", without any attention to its meaning.  Only when Caul begins to ponder the consequences of his actions does his life begin to unravel.Fans of ""The Conversation"" love to wonder how technology has impacted our culture.  Other fans are simply engrossed in the characters and plot developments.  What's great about this movie is that you ignore one of those angles and still be mesmerized.  If your attention is solely on Harry Caul and how his latest job has affected his life, then ""The Conversation"" is a terrific thriller.  And if your attention wanders towards how our lives have been changed forever by technology, specifically surveillance, then ""The Conversation"" will give you plenty to think about.  You can be as isolated as Caul is when the story begins, and you can be as involved as Caul is when the story ends.The premise sounds simple when you talk about plot.  In short, Harry Caul (played with great restraint and insecurity by Gene Hackman) is an expert on spying on people for different clients.  His latest job requires some tweaking because his targets' conversation is cluttered with all sorts of sounds from the San Francisco streets.  As he tunes his recording, he begins to suspect something terrible is about to happen.Like all great stories, ""The Conversation"" is effective because of the telling.  Seeing a technician tune an audio recording sounds boring, but it works because since Harry Caul seems to lack interest in a social life, we want to see what he IS passionate about: His work.  Or how about those annoying scenes in movies when a bunch of characters are being unpleasant drunks?  In ""The Conversation"", there's a lengthy sequence where Harry has allowed some fellow surveillance experts into his workplace.  Rather than be a bunch of idiots behave foolishly, there's a hotshot East Coast expert named Bernie (Allen Garfield) whose made a name for himself, but is borderline-obsessed with how Harry pulled off a couple of tricky jobs.  His cockiness is equalled only by his jealousy, which results in some very cruel tricks as the evening goes on.The supporting cast is top-notch, because we remember the faces we need to, and forget the faces that Coppola wants us to forget.  The targets of Harry's latest job are shown just enough so that we remember their faces and voices, but don't know too much about their personalities...just like Harry does.  On the other hand, Harrison Ford delivers an unforgettably creepy turn as the assistant to Harry's client.  There's a scene where Harry is obviously being followed, and when Harry finally confronts the assistant, Ford slyly replies:""I haven't been 'FOLLOWING' you.  I've been 'LOOKING' for you.""  It's clear that it's the former.It's not often that the sound effects of a movie make headlines, however Walter Murch's work on the sound is more crucial to the piece than most movies (Ben Burtt's work on ""WALL-E"" comes to mind).  I have yet to watch the DVD extras with Walter Murch, but the way the conversation between Harry's targets (hence the title) fades in and out is superb.  During the opening credits, the camera slowly zooms in on a town square, filled with distant music and chatter.  But then a soft electronic distortion fades in and out.  As the camera approaches closer to the ground, the garbled noise is even more noticable.  When we get closer to the conversation and the targets, their sentences are periodically interrupted with low clarity.  Sometimes what we miss is inconcequential chit-chat; other times, we miss crucial pieces to the puzzle that will change Harry's life forever.If there's any weakness in this movie, it's one early scene where Harry visits a woman in the middle of the night.  It's a sad scene where Harry confuses his ladyfriend's questions for an interrogation.  She simply wants to know more about his life, and he's still shaken that someone managed to leave a present in his apartment when he thought he had the only key.  The reason this scene doesn't quite work for me is because it never made sense to me how someone as lonely as Harry Caul managed to meet this woman in the first place, let alone how they managed to have a physical relationship.  If this scene had been removed, the later courtship between Harry and one of the alluring partygoers still would've worked.  However, that's a minor quibble that quickly resolves itself early in the movie, letting the story quickly regain its momentum.And once ""The Conversation"" picks up momentum, it maintains its grip through the end of the picture, from the details of Harry's investigation to the troubling aftermath of a shocking, violent turn-of-events.  To be sure, ""The Conversation"" has one of the most unforgettable endings (and camera shots) in motion picture history.""The Conversation"" is my favorite film from the 1970s.  There is so much more I want to share with you, the sign of any great film, I think.  ""The Conversation"" is not only filled with complexities and subtleties, you can enjoy the film as simply or as deeply as you want to.  Francis Ford Coppola and Gene Hackman have stated in separate interviews that ""The Conversation"" is probably the favorite of their respective film careers.

Some folks say he held out until The Godfather Part III. Some blame the S. E. Hinton adaptations of the early eighties. Most settle on One from the Heart, while a few intrepid souls go as far back as Apocalypse Now and attempt to make a case that it's really not as great a movie as the rest of us know it is. In fact, one of the very few movies that has never been mentioned as the beginning of the end is The Conversation, the movie Coppola made in between the first two parts of the Godfather saga. It was mostly eclipsed by those movies in the seventies, but a small cadre of critics and Godfather fanatics kept talking about it until the rest of the world rediscovered it twenty or so years ago. It has since become a recognized classic, perched soundly in IMDB's Top 250 and TSPDT's Top 1000.The Conversation is the story of a particularly stressful period in the life of Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a surveillance expert whose world is coming down around his ears. His longtime partner (John Cazale) has defected to his biggest competitor, his personal life is a shambles, and he thinks he heard something while on another job about setting someone up for murder. No one else is taking it seriously, so it's up to Harry to try and stop the murder himself. Harry, however, for all his skills in surveillance, is one of filmdom's most endearingly bad detectives.You think Hackman and Cazale are enough of a draw here (and they should be; Cazale's every film is an amazing piece of work)? Try adding in Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Elizabeth McRae, and the greatest star who never was, Frederic Forrest? Even better is the script. While Coppola is well-known as a director and producer these days, back in the sixties and seventies he wrote some of the world's great screenplays (including this and the Godfather adaptations, he was responsible for the 1974 Great Gatsby adaptation as well as two other perennially-in-top-movies-lists flicks, Is Paris Burning? and Patton). Why Coppola stopped writing screenplays I don't know, and this one is evidence that he probably should have kept going. Subtle, layered, with touches of humor and suspense weaved in, The Conversation is one of the great mystery films of the seventies, and is well worth your time. **** ",5,Forget the Godfather: this is Coppola and Cazale's finest pairing.,1248739200,"07 28, 2009",2009,2453,"['Conversation', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', '1974', 'Where', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'career', 'director', 'began', 'go', 'hideously', 'wrong', 'subject', 'great', 'deal', 'debate', 'folks', 'say', 'held', 'out', 'Godfather', 'Part', 'III', 'blame', 'S.', 'E.', 'Hinton', 'adaptations', 'early', 'eighties', 'Most', 'settle', 'One', 'Heart', 'few', 'intrepid', 'souls', 'go', 'far', 'back', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'attempt', 'make', 'case', 'really', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'rest', 'know', 'fact', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'movies', 'never', 'been', 'mentioned', 'beginning', 'end', 'Conversation', 'movie', 'Coppola', 'made', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'Godfather', 'saga', 'was', 'mostly', 'eclipsed', 'movies', 'seventies', 'small', 'cadre', 'critics', 'Godfather', 'fanatics', 'kept', 'talking', 'rest', 'world', 'rediscovered', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'ago', 'become', 'recognized', 'classic', 'perched', 'soundly', 'IMDB', 'Top', '250', 'TSPDT', 'Top', '1000.The', 'Conversation', 'story', 'particularly', 'stressful', 'period', 'life', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'world', 'coming', 'down', 'ears', 'longtime', 'partner', 'John', 'Cazale', 'defected', 'biggest', 'competitor', 'personal', 'life', 'shambles', 'heard', 'something', 'job', 'setting', 'someone', 'up', 'murder', 'one', 'else', 'taking', 'seriously', 'up', 'Harry', 'try', 'stop', 'murder', 'Harry', 'however', 'skills', 'surveillance', 'one', 'filmdom', 'most', 'endearingly', 'bad', 'detectives.You', 'think', 'Hackman', 'Cazale', 'are', 'enough', 'draw', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'Cazale', 'film', 'amazing', 'piece', 'work', 'Try', 'adding', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Allen', 'Garfield', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Elizabeth', 'McRae', 'greatest', 'star', 'who', 'never', 'was', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'Even', 'better', 'script', 'Coppola', 'well-known', 'director', 'producer', 'days', 'back', 'sixties', 'seventies', 'wrote', 'world', 'great', 'screenplays', 'including', 'Godfather', 'adaptations', 'was', 'responsible', '1974', 'Great', 'Gatsby', 'adaptation', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'other', 'perennially-in-top-movies-lists', 'flicks', 'Paris', 'Burning', 'Patton', 'Why', 'Coppola', 'stopped', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'evidence', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'going', 'Subtle', 'layered', 'touches', 'humor', 'suspense', 'weaved', 'Conversation', 'one', 'great', 'mystery', 'films', 'seventies', 'well', 'time', '****']",The Conversation
521850,A361LE16VBQDP8,B00003CX9I,Robert Bezimienny,"[6, 8]","The strengths of this film have been discussed extensively [...], however, for me, there is a problem with the core premiss.  Coppola wishes this to be a character study and, as such, it might be expected that there is in fact a character there to study; Harry Caul seems less a character than a faintly glossly, faintly translucent shell.  By the end of the film it is not so much that little has been learned about Harry, but that one fears there is hardly anything to learn.  Hackman has been praised and he does evince a sense of guardedness and paranoia which is compelling, but his is also a performance that suggests a rather frightening emptiness (contrary to Coppola's intention, as mentioned in his commentary, of having Harry Caul possess a 'lively and passionate core').  Coppola also refers to Hermann Hesse's novel 'Steppenwolf', and in this reference I think he again betrays the problem with the film, in that Harry Haller could well be taken as the skeleton of a man in search of a character, or better still, keen to divest himself of a character, not a conventional character open to conventional study. Still, the film's atmosphere and the resonances it has with its times are powerful, the sound and design, inventive.  Coppola seems to revel in hanging many of his casual insights over the basic scaffolding of the film - his commentary, too, operates primarily on this level: his enthusiams focus on incidentals (interesting incidentals, but incidentals nevertheless), such as Harrison Ford's alleged brilliance in adding 'depth' to his character (with cookies); at times, Coppola seems to be hiding too - for instance he waxes over the 'loneliness' of the solo piano score, and how he had never heard of a film score using a solo instrument, yet earlier on he mentions Michelangelo Antonioni who is reknowned for using just such scores.  So, it's almost as if the context of America, specifically America in the early 70's, provides much of the richness of this film, because Harry Caul certainly does not - he remains unknown to himself, to us, and, judging from the commentary, unknown largely to Coppola.",3,A Character Study Without A Character,996019200,"07 25, 2001",2001,2131,"['strengths', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'extensively', '[', ']', 'however', 'problem', 'core', 'premiss', 'Coppola', 'be', 'character', 'study', 'such', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'fact', 'character', 'there', 'study', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'less', 'character', 'faintly', 'glossly', 'faintly', 'translucent', 'shell', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'little', 'been', 'learned', 'Harry', 'one', 'fears', 'hardly', 'anything', 'learn', 'Hackman', 'been', 'praised', 'evince', 'sense', 'guardedness', 'paranoia', 'compelling', 'also', 'performance', 'rather', 'frightening', 'emptiness', 'contrary', 'Coppola', 'intention', 'mentioned', 'commentary', 'having', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'possess', ""'lively"", 'passionate', 'core', 'Coppola', 'also', 'Hermann', 'Hesse', 'novel', ""'Steppenwolf"", 'reference', 'think', 'again', 'problem', 'film', 'Harry', 'Haller', 'could', 'well', 'be', 'taken', 'skeleton', 'man', 'search', 'character', 'better', 'still', 'keen', 'divest', 'character', 'not', 'conventional', 'character', 'open', 'conventional', 'study', 'Still', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'resonances', 'times', 'are', 'powerful', 'sound', 'design', 'inventive', 'Coppola', 'revel', 'hanging', 'many', 'casual', 'insights', 'basic', 'scaffolding', 'film', 'commentary', 'too', 'primarily', 'level', 'enthusiams', 'focus', 'incidentals', 'interesting', 'incidentals', 'incidentals', 'nevertheless', 'such', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'alleged', 'brilliance', 'adding', ""'depth"", 'character', 'cookies', 'times', 'Coppola', 'be', 'hiding', 'too', 'instance', ""'loneliness"", 'solo', 'piano', 'score', 'how', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'film', 'score', 'using', 'solo', 'instrument', 'yet', 'earlier', 'Michelangelo', 'Antonioni', 'who', 'reknowned', 'using', 'just', 'such', 'scores', 'So', 'almost', 'context', 'America', 'specifically', 'America', 'early', '70', 'much', 'richness', 'film', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'certainly', 'not', 'unknown', 'judging', 'commentary', 'unknown', 'largely', 'Coppola']",The Conversation

Brilliantly portrayed by Gene Hackman, Harry Caul is such a person. (Even his girlfriend Amy, played by Teri Garr, does not know where he lives.) Harry is an expert technician who is retained to conduct electronic surveillance of those identified by his clients. In effect, he is a high-tech private investigator. What he records becomes evidence of illegal, unethical, or immoral behavior. Harry has no personal interest in the private lives he invades surreptitiously. But then he accepts an assignment and begins to suspect that the subjects of his surveillance will be murdered. The ""compartments"" in his life which Harry has so carefully separated begin to merge (albeit gradually) and he begins to have second thoughts about how he earns a living. Of course, he is better qualified than any other character in the film to understand (if not yet fully appreciate) the implications of an invasion of privacy. Under Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction, Harry begins to feel paranoid.I view The Conversation as a dark film because its raises so many questions which seem even more relevant today than they were in 1974. How secure can any life be? Who is accumulating personal as well as professional data about whom? Why? Satellites can take photographs of a license plate. All of the data on computer hard drives can be recovered. DNA tests can determine whether or not a monarch was poisoned hundreds of years ago. In so many ways, ""there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide"" from modern technologies. What intrigues me most about Harry Caul is his growing sense of dislocation and vulnerability as the conflict between his personal conscience and professional objectivity intensifies. The assignment for The Director (Robert Duvall) to conduct surveillance on Ann (Cindy Williams) and Mark (Frederic Forest) serves as a trigger which activates self-doubts and insecurities which Harry has presumably suppressed and denied for many years.For me, the final scene is most memorable because it's so ambiguous. To what extent has Harry invaded his own privacy? What has he learned? How will he now proceed with his personal life and career? For whatever reasons, only in recent years has this film received the praise it deserved but was denied when it first appeared almost 20 years ago. It seems to get even better each time it is seen again, especially in the DVD format which offers clearer image and sound as well as several excellent supplementary items such as commentaries by Coppola and his supervising editor Walter Murch as well as a ""Close-Up on the Conversation"" featurette.",5,George Orwell warned us....,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",2003,2789,"['Most', 'know', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'compartmentalize', 'life', 'separating', 'business', 'pleasure', 'career', 'family', 'etc', 'Such', 'people', 'have', 'exceptional', 'focus', 'determination', 'Brilliantly', 'portrayed', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'such', 'person', 'Even', 'girlfriend', 'Amy', 'played', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'Harry', 'expert', 'technician', 'who', 'retained', 'conduct', 'electronic', 'surveillance', 'identified', 'clients', 'effect', 'high-tech', 'private', 'investigator', 'What', 'evidence', 'illegal', 'unethical', 'immoral', 'behavior', 'Harry', 'personal', 'interest', 'private', 'surreptitiously', 'then', 'assignment', 'suspect', 'subjects', 'surveillance', 'will', 'be', 'murdered', 'compartments', 'life', 'Harry', 'so', 'carefully', 'separated', 'begin', 'merge', 'gradually', 'have', 'second', 'thoughts', 'how', 'living', 'course', 'better', 'qualified', 'other', 'character', 'film', 'understand', 'not', 'yet', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'implications', 'invasion', 'privacy', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Harry', 'feel', 'paranoid.I', 'Conversation', 'dark', 'film', 'raises', 'so', 'many', 'questions', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'were', '1974', 'How', 'secure', 'can', 'life', 'be', 'Who', 'accumulating', 'personal', 'as', 'well', 'professional', 'data', 'whom', 'Why', 'can', 'take', 'photographs', 'license', 'plate', 'data', 'computer', 'hard', 'drives', 'can', 'be', 'recovered', 'DNA', 'tests', 'can', 'determine', 'not', 'monarch', 'was', 'poisoned', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ago', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'nowhere', 'run', 'nowhere', 'hide', 'modern', 'technologies', 'What', 'most', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'growing', 'sense', 'dislocation', 'vulnerability', 'conflict', 'personal', 'conscience', 'professional', 'objectivity', 'intensifies', 'assignment', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'conduct', 'surveillance', 'Ann', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Mark', 'Frederic', 'Forest', 'trigger', 'self-doubts', 'insecurities', 'Harry', 'presumably', 'suppressed', 'denied', 'many', 'years.For', 'final', 'scene', 'most', 'memorable', 'so', 'ambiguous', 'what', 'extent', 'Harry', 'invaded', 'own', 'privacy', 'What', 'learned', 'How', 'will', 'now', 'proceed', 'personal', 'life', 'career', 'reasons', 'only', 'recent', 'years', 'film', 'received', 'praise', 'deserved', 'was', 'denied', 'when', 'first', 'appeared', 'almost', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'get', 'even', 'better', 'time', 'seen', 'again', 'especially', 'DVD', 'format', 'clearer', 'image', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'excellent', 'supplementary', 'items', 'such', 'commentaries', 'Coppola', 'supervising', 'editor', 'Walter', 'Murch', 'as', 'well', 'Close-Up', 'Conversation', 'featurette']",The Conversation

This film is not epic in scope.  It is instead a small, claustrophobic character study told without the cinematic operatics.  It is also a film that leaves virtually no impression on the viewer after it is over.Harry Caul (Gene Hackman) is a surveillance expert with a tragic past.  Hiring himself out for private jobs, he accepts an assignment to eavesdrop on two individuals walking together in public.  The recording he produces is not perfect but it suggests that a murder might soon be taking place.  Harry tries to ignore the fact that his recording might lead to dire consequences by telling himself he was just doing his job.  However, his conscience continues to torment him and he becomes obsessed with solving the mystery behind the conversation he recorded.""The Conversation"" is fascinating for providing a behind-the-scenes look at the art of professional eavesdropping.  Yet, it is tedious as a character study.  The film does a great job of defining Harry Caul as a disaster of a man on both a professional and a personal level.  However, watching Harry come apart at the seams is not exactly riveting entertainment despite Hackman's wonderful performance.  The entire film simply feels out of balance because there is too much emphasis on character and not enough emphasis on story.  Upon its release, ""The Conversation"" offered up some interesting commentary on the current orientation of the country shortly before Watergate, but it just feels over-simplistic and lacking content-wise when viewed today.",2,"""I'm not afraid of death, but I am afraid of murder.""",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",2004,1620,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Conversation', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Godfather', 'films', 'film', 'not', 'epic', 'scope', 'instead', 'small', 'claustrophobic', 'character', 'study', 'told', 'cinematic', 'operatics', 'also', 'film', 'virtually', 'impression', 'viewer', 'over.Harry', 'Caul', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'surveillance', 'expert', 'tragic', 'past', 'Hiring', 'private', 'jobs', 'assignment', 'eavesdrop', 'two', 'individuals', 'walking', 'together', 'public', 'recording', 'not', 'perfect', 'murder', 'might', 'soon', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'Harry', 'ignore', 'fact', 'recording', 'might', 'lead', 'dire', 'consequences', 'telling', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'job', 'However', 'conscience', 'torment', 'obsessed', 'solving', 'mystery', 'conversation', 'recorded', 'Conversation', 'fascinating', 'providing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'art', 'professional', 'eavesdropping', 'tedious', 'character', 'study', 'film', 'great', 'job', 'defining', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'disaster', 'man', 'professional', 'personal', 'level', 'However', 'watching', 'Harry', 'come', 'apart', 'seams', 'not', 'exactly', 'riveting', 'entertainment', 'Hackman', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'entire', 'film', 'simply', 'balance', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'character', 'not', 'enough', 'emphasis', 'story', 'release', 'Conversation', 'offered', 'up', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'current', 'orientation', 'country', 'shortly', 'Watergate', 'just', 'over-simplistic', 'lacking', 'content-wise', 'when', 'viewed', 'today']",The Conversation

It is a great, intriguing, and thoughtful film.  It came out in 1974 and was naturally overshadowed by The Godfather II.It was actually ahead of its time and remains a pertinent character study.  The film has the classic look and feel of prime time Coppola. The attention to detail and general pace is genius.  In the Conversation instead of Pacino or De Niro you get 100% Hackman. If you ever doubted him you should check this film out.  In The Conversation Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul. Caul is an ace private detective in the city of San Francisco. There is nothing glamorous or fantastic about his job. He is simply one of the best in the business. Harry Caul is a man of precision, intuitiveness, solitude, and paranoia. He is also a bit of a rock star but he would never admit to that. He is hired to tape a conversation between two random people in San Francisco's Union Square. This unique conversation  haunts and draws him in with obsession. He has done this a thousand times but this time something is just not right. You never really know what the conversation is about or what it fully entails. The outcome will ultimately surprise and intrigue. This film explores the concept of technology and its ever growing invasiveness in people's lives. This was an issue at the dawn of technology and it remains an important issue today. This is definitely a great movie that runs on the direction of Francis Ford Coppola and the acting merit of Gene Hackman.  The cool supporting cast includes John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Cindy Williams, Frederic Forrest, Harrison Ford and Robert Duvall.

521867,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B00003CX9I,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[4, 4]","Director:  Francis Ford CoppolaCast:  Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield, Frederic Forrest, Cindy Williams, Elizabeth MacRae, Michael Higgins, Teri Garr, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall.Running Time:  113 minutesRated R for language and a scene of violence.He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance, but from the start there are hints that while he's good, he's also careless. While his apartment is locked, his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress, Amy (Teri Garr in a small role) tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival co-worker to his office (which seems to be a warehouse) with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen, which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.  This is Harry Caul (played brilliantly by Gene Hackman), a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously, perhaps too seriously, which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own co-worker Stan (John Cazale) leaves him to go work for a rival agency, only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship -- it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy, and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others, even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all, he has a strong religious streak, and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment from The Director (in a cameo by Robert Duvall) has him worried: he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.As Harry slowly drags himself into the precarious business of strangers, the film's intentions become increasingly suspenseful and perplexing. Director Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather"" films) maintains his deliberately methodical pace throughout the entire film; it is only through our imagination that we are capable of creating and perpetuating such a consistently fascinating atmosphere surrounded by a cloud of tension and mystique. The Assistant Director (a young Harrison Ford) never physically carries himself as an intimidating antagonist; it is through the complexity of the film's plot and through the continual uncertain environment that we are able to associate this element with his character. Every person that carries himself in a convincingly dubious manner immediately becomes a potential suspect. Harry becomes compulsively obsessed with the fate of his client's targets, completely submerging himself into the substance of the recordings, looking for any potential details that might assist him in solving the mystery. Harry's investigation quickly becomes our task as well, as we begin to subconsciously observe and scrutinize each character involved. The beauty of Coppola's film is the fact that it makes its point by using the audience as proof of the inherent devious nature of privacy. The movie transports us into Harry's world, as we become infatuated with the secretive plot unfolding before us, and we desperately search for clues into the lives of the film's characters. Of course, after intense investigation, Harry ultimately comes to realize that he has violated all of the principles that he had once stood proudly for. Whether or not Harry ended up better off by becoming involved in the dealings of others is a completely subjective matter, but it is a crucial question that the viewer must ask him/herself.  This film, certainly one of Coppola's greatest of his illustrious career, is one of mystery and paranoia. The great performances of Hackman and Ford make this stand out, and the mystery that surrounds the plot creates suspense that keeps the audience focused and interested throughout. In general, this is one of the best mystery and suspense thrillers of the decade.",5,The Conversation  (1974),1149724800,"06 8, 2006",2006,4388,"['Director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'CoppolaCast', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'John', 'Cazale', 'Allen', 'Garfield', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Elizabeth', 'MacRae', 'Michael', 'Higgins', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Robert', 'Duvall.Running', 'Time', '113', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'scene', 'violence.He', 'supposed', 'be', 'leading', 'authority', 'freelance', 'surveillance', 'start', 'are', 'hints', 'good', 'also', 'careless', 'apartment', 'locked', 'landlord', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'present', 'mistress', 'Amy', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'small', 'role', 'saw', 'standing', 'staircase', 'entire', 'hour', 'rival', 'co-worker', 'office', 'be', 'warehouse', 'several', 'other', 'people', 'carelessly', 'man', 'record', 'own', 'conversation', 'means', 'what', 'be', 'innocuous', 'pen', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'place', 'James', 'Bond', 'movie', 'liaison', 'call', 'girl', 'party', 'results', 'stealing', 'tapes', 'conversation', 'recorded', 'lately', 'been', 'focus', 'obsession', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'loner', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'glum', 'be', 'good', 'company', 'work', 'seriously', 'perhaps', 'too', 'seriously', 'eventually', 'be', 'downfall', 'fact', 'own', 'co-worker', 'Stan', 'John', 'Cazale', 'go', 'work', 'rival', 'agency', 'only', 'prove', 'Harry', 'really', 'someone', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'loner', 'anyone', 'away', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'form', 'relationship', 'only', 'time', 'when', 'Amy', 'will', 'also', 'leave', 'somewhat', 'frustrated', 'wall', 'privacy', 'built', 'entire', 'life', 'revolves', 'secrecy', 'only', 'able', 'live', 'vicariously', 'others', 'even', 'guilty', 'would', 'deny', 'top', 'strong', 'religious', 'streak', 'discloses', 'confession', 'was', 'witness', 'surveillance', 'gone', 'wrong', 'resulted', 'deaths', 'three', 'people', 'Now', 'assignment', 'Director', 'cameo', 'Robert', 'Duvall', 'worried', 'listened', 'conversation', 'man', 'woman', 'afraid', 'woman', 'husband', 'may', 'try', 'kill', 'both.As', 'Harry', 'slowly', 'precarious', 'business', 'strangers', 'film', 'intentions', 'become', 'increasingly', 'suspenseful', 'perplexing', 'Director', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Godfather', 'films', 'deliberately', 'methodical', 'pace', 'entire', 'film', 'only', 'imagination', 'are', 'capable', 'creating', 'perpetuating', 'such', 'consistently', 'fascinating', 'atmosphere', 'surrounded', 'cloud', 'tension', 'mystique', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'young', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'never', 'physically', 'intimidating', 'antagonist', 'complexity', 'film', 'plot', 'continual', 'uncertain', 'environment', 'are', 'able', 'associate', 'element', 'character', 'person', 'convincingly', 'dubious', 'manner', 'immediately', 'potential', 'suspect', 'Harry', 'compulsively', 'obsessed', 'fate', 'client', 'targets', 'completely', 'submerging', 'substance', 'recordings', 'looking', 'potential', 'details', 'might', 'assist', 'solving', 'mystery', 'Harry', 'investigation', 'quickly', 'task', 'as', 'well', 'begin', 'subconsciously', 'observe', 'scrutinize', 'character', 'involved', 'beauty', 'Coppola', 'film', 'fact', 'point', 'using', 'audience', 'proof', 'inherent', 'devious', 'nature', 'privacy', 'movie', 'Harry', 'world', 'become', 'infatuated', 'secretive', 'plot', 'unfolding', 'desperately', 'search', 'clues', 'lives', 'film', 'characters', 'course', 'intense', 'investigation', 'Harry', 'ultimately', 'realize', 'violated', 'principles', 'had', 'once', 'stood', 'proudly', 'Whether', 'not', 'Harry', 'ended', 'up', 'better', 'off', 'becoming', 'involved', 'dealings', 'others', 'completely', 'subjective', 'matter', 'crucial', 'question', 'viewer', 'must', 'ask', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'Coppola', 'greatest', 'illustrious', 'career', 'one', 'mystery', 'paranoia', 'great', 'performances', 'Hackman', 'Ford', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'mystery', 'plot', 'suspense', 'audience', 'focused', 'interested', 'general', 'one', 'best', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'thrillers', 'decade']",The Conversation

Extremely annoying and loud at the end. The story itself is dull and the directing is also kind of obvious with sudden cuts to things meant to shock. It's dated in that respect.

521876,A4YXKE5F62II8,B00003CX9I,Visual Bureau,"[1, 1]","""Being one of the few people who has seen three Francis Ford Coppola films (i.e. Bram Stoker's Dracula and Jack) but never seen The Godfather trilogy, The Conversation is by far his strongest and one of the most thematically challenging, compelling, cold/distant, and mentally intense films made in recent memory.There are obvious and discreet cues as to why I would make this claim. Harry Caul, played by Gene Hackman in a challenging, unsettling, and mysterious role, is our eavesdropper in the film and he is depicted very much as a quiet, forlorn, and eerily distraught man full of coldness and fear. Nonetheless, he is a complex figure only rendered even more complex when he starts hearing a person's conversation on tapes multiple times believing that there might be a murder. To some who will watch this, a lot of things go on but it all seems minimal and rather simplistic on face value. Not entirely as the film, like it or not, is a case study in psychological warfare and paranoia than a conventional, spelled-out thriller or political drama like some of the trailers or connections to other films this film may associate with.It was not a very enjoyable film because much of the narrative relies on his mood and temperament amid the chaos he is trying to analyse in his head and ears through intense, almost voyeuristic surveillance. There is no sense of cliche in this film at all reminding you that the film you wanted to like is not what you expected. The film is better off seen as a film studies case in character analysis, sound design, and cinematography (which, beyond all judgment, is stellar for its time). More importantly, the film serves as a shocking historical document which preceded break-in national news about the Watergate scandal and Richard M. Nixon's pack of cronies.To much respect, the Watergate felt like there was more action involved than there was actual psychoanalysis but inevitably much of the minds behind the cover-ups would ultimately rest their fate and find glory (especially in the surveillance convention scenes) and horror (especially toward the tricky end which will not be disclosed) in this film. Premonitions about controversial events do not come often and this is a very strong but slightly oblique example (much like The China Syndrome or Three Mile Island and the 1970s drama, The Man, or Obama's election win in 2008).The film is a cinematic, novel-like puzzle and a historical premonition and, even amid much of its difficult dramatic and unconventional presence, still garners some credit for that too.""",3,Don't be misled by it!

Caul finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy after spying on a young couple (Cindy Williams and Frederic Forrest). When he turns over the tapes (to a young Harrison Ford)he wonders what he's wandered into as it appears he may have put the couple in danger and someone may be following Harry himself.A low key paranoid thriller like ""The Parallax View"", ""The Conversation"" features a marvelous, subtle performance by Gene Hackman (this is one of Hackman's favorite films and favorite performances)and strong work from the supporting cast (including Terri Garr and the late John Cazale).The transfer is quite nice with a surprising sharp transfer for a vintage film. Colors are subdued but that's the way the film has always looked. Keep in mind that the film is grainy and has always looked that way (it's not atypical for a film from the era).The audio sounds quite nice giving prominence to David Shire's moody score where appropriate. Dialogue is crystal clear throughout. we get both the mono and a nice 5.1 remix.The special features are quite nice for this set and surprisingly robust given that this isn't one of Coppola's best known films.We get everything ported over from the 2000 DVD including Coppola's commentary track as well as sound editor Walter Murch's commentary track. We also get the original vintage featurette on the film. The original theatrical trailer is also included as well.New to the Blu-ray are screen tests for both Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford.

521883,A1COQ2DOO1O9HD,B00003CX9I,Wing J. Flanagan,"[5, 5]","There is something about Hackman, slouched in his rumpled clear plastic raincoat; something in the sense of isolation, of despair and hopelessness so deep that he has ceased noticing.  He's like a homeless man - the kind you pretend not to notice when you walk past.  That he happens to have a place to live and plenty of money is beside the point.  Hackman's character is broken, lonely, used up, empty.  He so desperately needs validation...and he will never get it.Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is not so much a thriller as a deconstruction of the thriller genre.  As embodied by Gene Hackman, surveillance expert Harry Caul is an archetype: he is Late 20th-Century American Man.  He is the result of the dislocation between the decent impulses of a traditional upbringing and the demands of the cold, bloodless technological age in which he must operate.Harry is hired by &quot;the director&quot; (Robert Duvall), a man who sits at the top of a large, faceless corporation (we don't know what they do, but it's irrelevant, anyway).  His job is to record a seemingly innocuous conversation between a man and woman as they walk through Union Square in San Francisco.  Against his better judgment, Harry becomes personally interested in the contents of the conversation. He becomes convinced that the recording, if he turns it in and collects his hefty fee, will lead to murder.  What should he do?The plot sets up a dilemma that could describe quite a bit of American history for the past 40 years - Harry can prosper through the questionable use of technology (and quite possibly at the expense of some lives), or he can Do The Right Thing at potentially great expense to himself.As a Roman Catholic, he needs to rid himself of guilt and seek redemption.  But as an ordinary man, shell-shocked by accelerating technological and moral change, he possesses an equally strong desire to withdraw.The irony only comes clear in the celebrated twist ending, which exists not simply to provide a clever plot device, but to underline a powerful moral argument.  It would be easy to say that argument is about privacy, or technology, or the abuse of power.  Easy but only partly true.What The Conversation really argues is the folly of trying to intervene in a situation one does not fully comprehend.  In this respect, it echoes America's involvement in Vietnam.In the years since, much of America has become even more detached, cynical, and withdrawn; more Harry Caul-like than ever.  The moral dilemmas we face now are even more daunting (what to do about teen violence, for example).
