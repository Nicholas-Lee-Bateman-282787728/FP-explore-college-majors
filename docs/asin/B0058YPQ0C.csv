1447583,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0058YPQ0C,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[7, 11]","This is a very weird concluding season.  The vast proportion of time is spent on everyone's love life as every male in the show strives to end up happy ever after with the woman of his choice.  This is such a far cry from where this show began that I could scarcely believe it.  Judging from the prior season, I thought we were headed for a very dark, very grim ending instead.  This season resembles a romance novel more than anything else with its stress on finding happy ever after with true love, marriage, babies, etc.,  If the guys had all ended up monks in an abbey, I couldn't have been more surprised. To put it mildly, this is a very surprising twist in everyone's character arc from the prior 7 seasons.For the show scenes not headed in that direction, we did have a few good moments.  Andrew Dice Clay became the co-star for Drama's cartoon tv series.  Drama and Clay have a huge stand off with the producers for more money.  This is very rooted in show business reality and Clay and Kevin Dillon are wonderful in this sub plot.Vinny Chase has to pass a drug test and Billy comes up with a fake male appendage to use in the bathroom with the cop.  This fake is even filled with someone else's urine so that he will pass the test.  I found this whole sub plot very funny.Vinny also tries to save a fellow drug abuser from going over the deep end. This ""gentler, nicer, I want to be part of the solution"" Vinny Chase ends up right on the edge of outright satire in his new personality.  Considering how the show concluded, I think the makers of this show took this conversion seriously but I found it satiric.And then there is Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold.  We seem to resolve his problems too but after the credits are over, a new scene plays which presents a whole new career path for Ari.  Spin Off.  That's why ENTOURAGE is over is my guess.  They want Piven to star as Ari in his own series in a new Hollywood career. Stay tuned.",3,Happily Ever After?

1447586,AX53DA3FTILL0,B0058YPQ0C,Gene Siskel,"[0, 0]","THE GOOD- Drama's storyline provides the most laughs for the season.  Dice holding up the network for more money is consistent with his infamous ego.  It plays beautifully in this storyline with a tormented Drama must choose between a potential tv series or his loyalty to his friend Dice.  Ari's storyline was also very good and is given much funnier stuff than he was in season seven.  Most importantly, is the inclusion of Lloyd, who was reduced to a background character (I have no idea why) in season 7.  Scott (E's business partner) steals the season. He was hilarious as a dirty-minded sleazeball.THE BAD-  E's storyline is flat out annoying.  With him and Sloan acting like two high school kids by saying they don't want to be in each other's lives anymore.  So, why are they always calling each other on the phone and paying visits to each other?  E acts uncharacteristically sleazy in this season and is not the sharp character he was in previous seasons.  They then add some unnecessary twist to E's story, which was probably done solely for the fact it was the show's last season.  Vince had a decent storyline going until it's god awful conclusion, which no fan bought for a mili-second.  Turtle never seems to pay for all his stupidity and poor business decisions.  Once again, Turtle walks out unscathed after making yet another business blunder.  The resolution of his story is equally preposterous as Vince's.  The last two episodes of this season are so slapdashed together it ruins the first six good episodes.THE DEAL- Despite it's hokey finale, this season is funnier than season 7.  Had they done 12 or 13 episodes this would have been a much better season.  But even with 12 episodes or so, I still wouldn't have bought the lame conclusion they had for Vince.  They should have left it more open-ended instead of forcing a sense of closure.  That would have been better.  Also, it may have helped to close out by reinforcing the unity of the gang they will always be there for each other.  But the way it was concluded made that an impossibility.  A horrible ending for an otherwise good-very good show.",3,This could have been better,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,2126,"['GOOD-', 'Drama', 'storyline', 'most', 'laughs', 'season', 'Dice', 'holding', 'up', 'network', 'more', 'money', 'consistent', 'infamous', 'ego', 'beautifully', 'storyline', 'tormented', 'Drama', 'must', 'choose', 'potential', 'tv', 'series', 'loyalty', 'friend', 'Dice', 'Ari', 'storyline', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'given', 'much', 'funnier', 'stuff', 'was', 'season', 'seven', 'Most', 'importantly', 'inclusion', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'was', 'reduced', 'background', 'character', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'season', '7', 'Scott', 'E', 'business', 'partner', 'season', 'was', 'hilarious', 'dirty-minded', 'sleazeball.THE', 'BAD-', 'E', 'storyline', 'flat', 'annoying', 'Sloan', 'acting', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'saying', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'other', 'lives', 'anymore', 'So', 'why', 'are', 'always', 'calling', 'other', 'phone', 'paying', 'visits', 'other', 'E', 'acts', 'uncharacteristically', 'sleazy', 'season', 'not', 'sharp', 'character', 'was', 'previous', 'seasons', 'then', 'add', 'unnecessary', 'twist', 'E', 'story', 'was', 'probably', 'done', 'solely', 'fact', 'was', 'show', 'last', 'season', 'Vince', 'had', 'decent', 'storyline', 'going', 'god', 'awful', 'conclusion', 'fan', 'bought', 'mili-second', 'Turtle', 'never', 'pay', 'stupidity', 'poor', 'business', 'decisions', 'Once', 'again', 'Turtle', 'out', 'unscathed', 'making', 'yet', 'business', 'blunder', 'resolution', 'story', 'equally', 'preposterous', 'Vince', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'so', 'slapdashed', 'first', 'six', 'good', 'episodes.THE', 'DEAL-', 'hokey', 'finale', 'season', 'funnier', 'season', '7', 'Had', 'done', '12', '13', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'season', 'even', '12', 'episodes', 'so', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bought', 'lame', 'conclusion', 'had', 'Vince', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'more', 'open-ended', 'instead', 'forcing', 'sense', 'closure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Also', 'may', 'have', 'helped', 'close', 'out', 'reinforcing', 'unity', 'gang', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'other', 'way', 'was', 'concluded', 'made', 'impossibility', 'horrible', 'ending', 'otherwise', 'good-very', 'good', 'show']",Entourage: The Complete Eighth and Final Season

1447592,A211TYB51TIZ6Q,B0058YPQ0C,"J. McQueen ""Anti-Charisma""","[24, 25]","This is another season that will divide fans because everyone has their own opinion about how the season was supposed to end.Of the eight episodes of this shortened season, I thought that the first seven were fantastic. However, the series finale ended with a whimper instead of a bang.Let's start with its good aspects and end with the less positive ones:(1) The First Seven Episodes - Every character had major conflicts that he needed to resolve in this season.  Johnny Drama is on the cusp of starring in a television show that could rival the ""Simpsons"" and ""Futurama"" in terms of its popularity.  But, he will have to mediate between the strong wills of his co-star, Andrew Dice Clay, and his producer to push the project through. Turtle could make a name for himself as he spear-heads the U.S. launch of Avion tequila; however, despite his street-smarts and enthusiasm, he may not have the business acumen needed to turn a profit.  As far as Eric (""E"") is concerned, he has changed. We all believed that E was a nave minnow trying to protect his friend, Vincent Chase, from the shark-tank that is Hollywood. By this season, we discover that E is a shark himself. Some of his actions this season are so breathtakingly manipulative and cynical that we have to wonder if he has lost his soul.  As E loses his soul, Ari Gold struggles to find his. Once again, Jeremy Piven turns in an acting tour de force, as Ari ponders his life as a potential divorcee. What does a man in his mid-40s with all that clout, intelligence and ambition do when he has suddenly lost the family that kept his darker impulses in-check? This season we get to find out and the end-result is fascinating. Finally, we see yet another side of Vincent Chase. Vince is clean and sober after a court-mandated rehab stint. Internalizing the lessons of his sobriety support group, Vince decides that he is going to enrich the lives of those around him --- by any means necessary. Vince's aggressively good-intentioned meddling in the lives of others has both some awkwardly comedic and shockingly tragic ramifications.  Overall Grade for these 7 episodes: A -minus)(2) The Final Episode - The series finale seemed disjointed and oddly anti-climatic. This is particularly unfortunate since there were four episodes in the final season which are amongst the best of the series.  HBO, as a whole, has been very hit-or-miss in how it concludes series. The finale to the Sopranos ended abruptly. While ambiguity can be a good thing,that finale seemed to do the series a disservice. Conversely, the finale to Six Feet Under was one of the best I have ever seen. I would place Entourage in the Sopranos category; its clumsy attempt to tie up loose ends will probably have a negative impact on how this season is viewed. (Overall grade for the final episode: D - plus)With all of this said, Entourage was a great series and I will certainly will miss it.",4,A Mixed Review,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2917,"['season', 'will', 'divide', 'fans', 'everyone', 'own', 'opinion', 'how', 'season', 'was', 'supposed', 'end.Of', 'eight', 'episodes', 'shortened', 'season', 'thought', 'first', 'seven', 'were', 'fantastic', 'However', 'series', 'finale', 'ended', 'whimper', 'instead', 'bang.Let', 'start', 'good', 'aspects', 'end', 'less', 'positive', 'ones', '1', 'First', 'Seven', 'Episodes', 'Every', 'character', 'had', 'major', 'conflicts', 'needed', 'resolve', 'season', 'Johnny', 'Drama', 'cusp', 'starring', 'television', 'show', 'could', 'rival', 'Simpsons', 'Futurama', 'terms', 'popularity', 'will', 'have', 'mediate', 'strong', 'wills', 'co-star', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'producer', 'push', 'project', 'Turtle', 'could', 'make', 'name', 'U.S.', 'launch', 'Avion', 'tequila', 'however', 'street-smarts', 'enthusiasm', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'business', 'acumen', 'needed', 'turn', 'profit', 'As', 'far', 'Eric', 'E', 'concerned', 'changed', 'believed', 'E', 'was', 'nave', 'minnow', 'trying', 'protect', 'friend', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'shark-tank', 'Hollywood', 'season', 'discover', 'E', 'shark', 'actions', 'season', 'are', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'manipulative', 'cynical', 'have', 'wonder', 'lost', 'soul', 'E', 'soul', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'find', 'Once', 'again', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'acting', 'tour', 'force', 'Ari', 'life', 'potential', 'divorcee', 'What', 'man', 'mid-40s', 'clout', 'intelligence', 'ambition', 'do', 'when', 'suddenly', 'lost', 'family', 'kept', 'darker', 'in-check', 'season', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'end-result', 'fascinating', 'Finally', 'see', 'yet', 'side', 'Vincent', 'Chase', 'Vince', 'clean', 'sober', 'court-mandated', 'rehab', 'stint', 'Internalizing', 'lessons', 'sobriety', 'support', 'group', 'Vince', 'going', 'enrich', 'lives', 'means', 'necessary', 'Vince', 'aggressively', 'good-intentioned', 'meddling', 'lives', 'others', 'awkwardly', 'comedic', 'shockingly', 'tragic', 'ramifications', 'Overall', 'Grade', '7', 'episodes', '-minus', '2', 'Final', 'Episode', 'series', 'finale', 'seemed', 'disjointed', 'oddly', 'anti-climatic', 'particularly', 'unfortunate', 'were', 'four', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'HBO', 'whole', 'been', 'very', 'hit-or-miss', 'how', 'series', 'finale', 'Sopranos', 'ended', 'abruptly', 'ambiguity', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'seemed', 'do', 'series', 'disservice', 'Conversely', 'finale', 'Six', 'Feet', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'place', 'Entourage', 'Sopranos', 'category', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'negative', 'impact', 'how', 'season', 'viewed', 'Overall', 'grade', 'final', 'episode', 'D', 'said', 'Entourage', 'was', 'great', 'series', 'will', 'certainly', 'will', 'miss']",Entourage: The Complete Eighth and Final Season

1447598,A2D37EP9KT2E3D,B0058YPQ0C,"Mark bennett ""Mark""","[49, 74]","Season seven was bad. But season eight is just horrible. I could understand trying to go a different direction in season seven to continue the show, but why go so far away from the show's roots in a final season.The entire season is bad relationship melodrama with nothing else. There is nothing interesting. It is the opposite of fun.Vince gets involved with what seems like a character left over from an unmade chic flick. You know, the bright uptight reporter from the big city who doesn't like the guy at first but then suddenly decides to instantly marry him without really even knowing him.Sloan (the boat-anchor of the show) whines her way through another season. And just when it seems that she is finally gone, they bring in a shotgun wedding to fix everything. Its really sad. They spend the whole season creating situations as to why she and Eric should not be together. Then put them together for the worst possible reason.And then we get a whole lot more Ari family drama. Its all derivative and repetitive from last season. And in the end, all the problems are solved by Italian singers and moving to Italy. Whatever.In each case, the reasoning is terrible. In each case, the man is completely at fault, the man must give up his friends, the man must give up his career. Its like they had a season of leftover sex-and-the-city scripts. I came away from the last episode thinking ""three inevitable divorces"" rather than happy ending.The whole drug thing from last season ends up going in an unexpected direction. Vince goes to treatment for a little while and everything is all better. No real consequences to speak of at all.The problem with Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold is that he only really knows how to play an agent. He transitions to different jobs in the series but the job and how he acts in the job is always the same. Thats not true to business. The things they never really show is (a) him dealing with a younger ""ari"" (what he used to be like) in his own company, (b) the implicit conflicts of interest in running a big company with lots of clients and (c) Vince isn't as important in the big picture to him as he was.Vince undercuts Drama and Turtle's attempts to strike out on their own by helping each in the wrong way. Turtle in particular ends up looking like an idiot. Some of the stuff with Drama is interesting, but having him get pushed around by Andrew Dice Clay wasn't. It would have been better, in my opinion, for Drama to have been the one holding out with ADC & Billy pushing him to settle.Somewhere along the way, they lost track of what made entourage fun and why people liked the show. Why with eight episodes left they decided to do a whole season about disfunctional relationships, is beyond me.",1,almost unwatchably bad,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,2737,"['Season', 'seven', 'was', 'bad', 'season', 'eight', 'just', 'horrible', 'could', 'understand', 'trying', 'go', 'different', 'direction', 'season', 'seven', 'continue', 'show', 'why', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'away', 'show', 'roots', 'final', 'season.The', 'entire', 'season', 'bad', 'relationship', 'melodrama', 'nothing', 'else', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'opposite', 'fun.Vince', 'involved', 'what', 'character', 'left', 'over', 'unmade', 'chic', 'flick', 'know', 'bright', 'uptight', 'reporter', 'big', 'city', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'guy', 'first', 'then', 'suddenly', 'instantly', 'marry', 'really', 'even', 'knowing', 'him.Sloan', 'boat-anchor', 'show', 'way', 'season', 'just', 'when', 'finally', 'gone', 'bring', 'shotgun', 'wedding', 'fix', 'everything', 'really', 'sad', 'spend', 'whole', 'season', 'creating', 'situations', 'why', 'Eric', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'together', 'Then', 'put', 'together', 'worst', 'possible', 'reason.And', 'then', 'get', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'Ari', 'family', 'drama', 'derivative', 'repetitive', 'last', 'season', 'end', 'problems', 'are', 'solved', 'Italian', 'singers', 'moving', 'Italy', 'Whatever.In', 'case', 'reasoning', 'terrible', 'case', 'man', 'completely', 'fault', 'man', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'friends', 'man', 'must', 'give', 'up', 'career', 'had', 'season', 'leftover', 'sex-and-the-city', 'scripts', 'came', 'away', 'last', 'episode', 'thinking', 'three', 'inevitable', 'divorces', 'rather', 'happy', 'ending.The', 'whole', 'drug', 'thing', 'last', 'season', 'up', 'going', 'unexpected', 'direction', 'Vince', 'treatment', 'little', 'while', 'everything', 'better', 'real', 'consequences', 'speak', 'all.The', 'problem', 'Jeremy', 'Piven', 'Ari', 'Gold', 'only', 'really', 'how', 'play', 'agent', 'different', 'jobs', 'series', 'job', 'how', 'job', 'always', 'same', 'Thats', 'not', 'true', 'business', 'things', 'never', 'really', 'show', 'dealing', 'younger', 'ari', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'own', 'company', 'b', 'implicit', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'running', 'big', 'company', 'lots', 'clients', 'c', 'Vince', ""n't"", 'as', 'important', 'big', 'picture', 'undercuts', 'Drama', 'Turtle', 'attempts', 'strike', 'out', 'own', 'helping', 'wrong', 'way', 'Turtle', 'particular', 'ends', 'up', 'looking', 'idiot', 'stuff', 'Drama', 'interesting', 'having', 'get', 'pushed', 'Andrew', 'Dice', 'Clay', 'was', ""n't"", 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'opinion', 'Drama', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'holding', 'out', 'ADC', 'Billy', 'pushing', 'settle.Somewhere', 'way', 'lost', 'track', 'what', 'made', 'entourage', 'fun', 'why', 'people', 'liked', 'show', 'Why', 'eight', 'episodes', 'left', 'decided', 'do', 'whole', 'season', 'disfunctional', 'relationships']",Entourage: The Complete Eighth and Final Season
