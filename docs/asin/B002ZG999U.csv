1311250,AKJ9MEE93DG5O,B002ZG999U,,"[0, 0]","The Expendables is a fun ride, but a disappointing one.  I won&#8217;t say it is bad.  I had fun with the movie.  However, it didn&#8217;t really deliver what they promised, or at least not fully.  This film is basically The Statham and Stallone show while the others are minor side characters or just have brief cameos.  The action is good, but the film does suffer from some shaky-cam.  This film just did not live up to its potential.As I said the film is fun.  When the action is there it is good for the most part despite the shaky-cam.  Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham bring their A-game.  They do a competent job acting-wise, the action scenes involving them are pretty good, and they do work off each other well.  It&#8217;s a good thing they do work well together because they pretty much have to carry the film for a major chunk.  Without their chemistry this film would probably suck.However, as I said previously, those two really hog the majority of the spotlight.  You have other action stars like Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, and Terry Crews who do not get that much screen time.  You see everyone together in the beginning action scene, and then they all just disappear leaving just Stallone and Statham for the entire middle portion.  They then all come back at the end for the final battle.  Then you have people like Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Mickey Rourke who just make brief cameos.  Rourke appears more than the other two but he doesn&#8217;t do anything.  Schwarzenegger I can understand at the time but the other two really have no excuse.Overall, if you want a fun action film with Stallone and Statham teamed up you will enjoy this film.  However, this film promised a union of so many of the big action stars.  We see them, but most are not in the film very much while others just make cameos.  When they are there it&#8217;s fun, but still.  This is basically Statham and Stallone&#8217;s movie.  Again, I don&#8217;t dislike the film.  I had fun with it, but I still found it a bit underwhelming.  Thankfully Expendables 2 and, hopefully, Expendables 3, improved upon the problems of this one.",3,"Fun, but Still Disappointing",1405468800,"07 16, 2014",2014,2137,"['Expendables', 'fun', 'ride', 'disappointing', 'one', 'won', '8217', 't', 'say', 'bad', 'had', 'fun', 'movie', 'However', '8217', 'really', 'deliver', 'what', 'promised', 'least', 'not', 'fully', 'film', 'basically', 'Statham', 'Stallone', 'show', 'others', 'are', 'minor', 'side', 'characters', 'just', 'have', 'brief', 'cameos', 'action', 'good', 'film', 'suffer', 'shaky-cam', 'film', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'potential.As', 'said', 'film', 'fun', 'When', 'action', 'good', 'most', 'part', 'shaky-cam', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'bring', 'A-game', 'do', 'competent', 'job', 'acting-wise', 'action', 'scenes', 'involving', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'do', 'work', 'off', 'other', 'well', '8217', 's', 'good', 'thing', 'do', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'carry', 'film', 'major', 'chunk', 'chemistry', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'suck.However', 'said', 'previously', 'two', 'really', 'hog', 'majority', 'spotlight', 'have', 'other', 'action', 'stars', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'see', 'everyone', 'together', 'beginning', 'action', 'scene', 'then', 'just', 'disappear', 'leaving', 'just', 'Stallone', 'Statham', 'entire', 'middle', 'portion', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'end', 'final', 'battle', 'Then', 'have', 'people', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'just', 'make', 'brief', 'cameos', 'Rourke', 'more', 'other', 'two', '8217', 'do', 'anything', 'Schwarzenegger', 'can', 'understand', 'time', 'other', 'two', 'really', 'have', 'excuse.Overall', 'want', 'fun', 'action', 'film', 'Stallone', 'Statham', 'teamed', 'up', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'However', 'film', 'promised', 'union', 'so', 'many', 'big', 'action', 'stars', 'see', 'most', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'others', 'just', 'make', 'cameos', 'When', 'are', '8217', 'fun', 'still', 'basically', 'Statham', 'Stallone', '8217', 's', 'movie', 'Again', 'don', '8217', 'film', 'had', 'fun', 'still', 'found', 'bit', 'underwhelming', 'Thankfully', 'Expendables', '2', 'hopefully', 'Expendables', '3', 'improved', 'problems', 'one']",N/A

But I expected a lot more from it. The story line and dialogs were either undone or felt like it lacked something, like a sauce for a spaghetti. Now let's take a look at the positives. Stallone chose a good(but not great) team of actors. There's plenty of money were put in the making of film and loads of nice ammo, shooting. But still it felt different as I mentioned above. From the team of veterans(well-known action actors) I still expected better roles as for Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. I expected the whole movie to be great. But as much as I wanted to love it from the first minute I can't say I did. And it was hard for me to decide to either give it three or four stars. I decided four for all the efforts.

1311252,A19JPROF2J4PA4,B002ZG999U,Acheron's Flow,"[0, 0]","Big cast. All known and proven actors. But this is really a low budget movie. Shaky cam and cheap effects really do not help. You can see where the plot is going pretty well as the movie progresses. Not really a problem with this kind of movie. IMDB lists this as having an 80 million budget and I think most was spent on actor's salaries. Every one is typecast and that was expected but the cheapness was a real surprise. Shaky cam covers a lot like Dolph's fight scene, close up on his leg as he kicks and cut back to his face. Yeah, ok. That looked real. Would have been better off having him fight older and wiser against a younger person.This style has a tight focus and hides most of the set and just happens to save them a bunch of money. What background you see is quick or out of focus when you see it at all. Popular with some film makers for this reason I think. Looked like a lot of ad libbing but it was good most of the time when it did not seem like actors kidding around on the set. This movie looks like it was made by a bunch of professionals quick and easy with little effort involved.A cheap money maker that filled the expectations but with a cast like this they could have made quite the movie.

1311267,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B002ZG999U,a man from the east coast,"[3, 3]","... based on all the negative reviews from all the critics bashing this film up one side and down the other.Folks say this film hasn't much of a plot; I say that isn't so.It's called mini-plot.There are three kinds of plots:  Arch-plot, mini-plot, and anti-plot (see Robert McKee's excellent ""Story"" for a detailed explanation of what makes for a great screenplay, along with more excellent discourse on character, plot, etc.).  ""The Expendables"" is mini-plot (conversely, something like ""Saving Private Ryan"" would fall under the arch-plot umbrella, for example).There isn't any great objective to be obtained here, like blowing up the Death Star; nor is there any ""oh, now they all understand, and isn't great that they're all better people"" moment either.  What we have is Barney Ross; we drop into his life, go along with him a ways, share an adventure, and then, once he's rescued the girl, we part ways.If this isn't your cup of tea, then ""The Expendables"" isn't for you.  However, if you want to see a great action picture that does, indeed, establish camraderie between yourself, Barney, and others in the cast, then you'll enjoy this film.Stallone has developed into a first-rate action director; one need only look as far as the recent films ""Rocky Balboa"" and ""Rambo: Burmese"" to see this.  He's quite skilled behind a camara; one might even call him an artist.(That stands to reason, since he's delivered some excellent paintings over the years.  Don't believe me?  It's called ""google"".)Stallone has an eye for a great scene; he always know just exactly how to use the camara to bring his audience right into the center of the action.  The action choreography is spot-on first-rate here; it's just impossible not to have fun watching this film.Personally, I didn't have any issues with the dialog here, since tough guys do tend to talk like this.  I will say that hopefully, as this series continues, Stallone will flex his screenwriting muscles a bit more; ""Rocky Balboa"" contained some of the best dialog he's written in years, so hopefully, as he writes additional material for this series, he'll invest himself a bit more in what his characters have to say.(Personally, I think Stallone chose this vehicle because at this point in his career, he wants to go out strong, and yet he also wants to re-establish himself as a major-box office draw.  This will, in turn, provide an opportunity for such artistic endeavors as ""Poe"", and also his possible upcoming portrayal of John Gotti.

Trying to rekindle some of the movie styles that have these days become post Matrix, Bourne style choppy fast camera fights and dramas, that you need to replay to enjoy.The movie isn't bad, on the one hand it's totally shameless with the line up, adding Schwarzenegger and Willis to the ""Starring"" line up is a joke really, they are on screen for about 3 minutes of dialogue, and that's it, hardly noteworthy. Surprised they didn't have someone watching an old movie clip so they could have added ""starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman"" to the line up, but I digress.It's a fairly simple story, the movie opens with an unconnected rescue scene to introduce us to Stallone's team of ""Expendables"" dealing with some Somalia pirates on a ship somewhere with hostages (very topical)plenty of gun play and action to whet the appetite so to speak.We then get a deeper perspective of the main characters, particularly Stallone and Statham, as they undertake a ""overthrow dictator and rescue innocents"" mission in some made up island ""in the gulf"" - In the gulf? - which gulf, I mean come on people, details please even if it's made up.Of course the mission is a lie, to aid CIA drug shenanigans, and the team have to figure out the good guys from the bad guys, and so on.For me, here's where the film split, and annoyingly so.If you want to make an out and out testosterone flick (the original Predator, or Rambo springs to mind) do so. Don't add in padding scenes like Mickey Rourke getting all misty eyed and introspective about old missions, and the mental and emotional cost of ""war is hell"".Ultimately, the film tries not to be a mindless action drama, but after the meandering script dips it's toe into heartfelt character building, the movie explodes into a killing spree where just about everyone gets beaten, shot or blown up in the last 20 minutes anyway.They are a few moments of levity, some tongue in cheek action sequences, and some downright good action scenes, but it felt like Stallone couldn't make up his mind between action, and a thinking mans drama, and ended up delivering neither.Statham carries the whole movie for me, most of the other characters are in there for just the fighting scenes, and have little character development, but then again didn't really need any I suppose.It's an OK movie, definitely worth seeing, to find out what all your friends who have seen it are chatting about, but not destined to be a classic I fancy.Stallone has proved if nothing else that he's pretty good these days in the executive producers chair, maybe he should there. 3 stars",3,Make up your mind...........,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",2011,2654,"['Stallone', 'al', 'deliver', 'throwback', 'homage', 'action', 'movie', 'genre', 'Trying', 'rekindle', 'movie', 'have', 'days', 'become', 'post', 'Matrix', 'Bourne', 'style', 'choppy', 'fast', 'camera', 'fights', 'dramas', 'need', 'replay', 'enjoy.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'bad', 'one', 'hand', 'totally', 'shameless', 'line', 'up', 'adding', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Willis', 'Starring', 'line', 'up', 'joke', 'really', 'are', 'screen', '3', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'hardly', 'noteworthy', 'Surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'someone', 'watching', 'old', 'movie', 'clip', 'could', 'have', 'added', 'starring', 'Steve', 'McQueen', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'line', 'up', 'digress.It', 'fairly', 'simple', 'story', 'movie', 'unconnected', 'rescue', 'scene', 'introduce', 'Stallone', 'team', 'Expendables', 'dealing', 'Somalia', 'pirates', 'ship', 'somewhere', 'hostages', 'very', 'topical', 'plenty', 'gun', 'play', 'action', 'whet', 'appetite', 'so', 'speak.We', 'then', 'get', 'deeper', 'perspective', 'main', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Stallone', 'Statham', 'undertake', 'overthrow', 'dictator', 'rescue', 'innocents', 'mission', 'made', 'up', 'island', 'gulf', 'gulf', 'gulf', 'mean', 'come', 'people', 'details', 'please', 'even', 'made', 'up.Of', 'course', 'mission', 'lie', 'aid', 'CIA', 'drug', 'shenanigans', 'team', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'so', 'on.For', 'here', 'where', 'film', 'split', 'annoyingly', 'so.If', 'want', 'make', 'out', 'testosterone', 'flick', 'original', 'Predator', 'Rambo', 'springs', 'mind', 'do', 'so', 'Do', ""n't"", 'add', 'padding', 'scenes', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'getting', 'misty', 'eyed', 'introspective', 'old', 'missions', 'mental', 'emotional', 'cost', 'war', 'hell', '.Ultimately', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'mindless', 'action', 'drama', 'meandering', 'script', 'toe', 'heartfelt', 'character', 'building', 'movie', 'killing', 'spree', 'where', 'just', 'everyone', 'beaten', 'shot', 'blown', 'up', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'anyway.They', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'levity', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'action', 'sequences', 'downright', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'felt', 'Stallone', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'action', 'thinking', 'mans', 'drama', 'ended', 'up', 'delivering', 'neither.Statham', 'whole', 'movie', 'most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'have', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'then', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'suppose.It', 'OK', 'movie', 'definitely', 'worth', 'seeing', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'are', 'chatting', 'not', 'destined', 'be', 'classic', 'fancy.Stallone', 'proved', 'nothing', 'else', 'pretty', 'good', 'days', 'executive', 'producers', 'chair', 'maybe', 'should', 'there', '3', 'stars']",N/A

So it must be really good, right? Well, it's actually a pretty basic action flick. The plot is uncomplicated and straight-to-the-point. For some, that sounds great to them. For others, the simplicity is a little too simple and that subtracts from the film's overall quality.Stallone directs and co-writes the screenplay for this ultimate action star flick, and he does really well. The ensemble of Stallone, Statham, Rourke, Couture, Lundgren, Li, Crews, Roberts, and Austin (plus cameos by Willis and Schwarzenegger) do a wonderful job with the acting and blowing up body parts of bad guys. However, the story was written merely for an action purpose. There is an unbelievable part to the film near the end between partners-in-crime, the General (David Zayas) and baddie James Munroe (Roberts); I won't get specific so as not to spoil it. But, it's just not believable. Of course, the action is unrealistic but that's expected in any action flick. But this interaction with the General and Munroe makes the film -- particularly the ending -- a bit hard to swallow.Overall, ""The Expendables"" is a good film. I enjoyed it and liked all the action. The characters were well played and I am looking forward to the sequel that I heard is already in the works. However, I enjoyedThe A-Teama lot more! Maybe it's because of my sense of nostalgia, or maybe it's 'cause I think Liam Neeson rocks. Either way, I enjoyed it better.

I expected to see a troupe of guys kicking butt in some dumb steroid-filled action frenzy. I was mistaken.This film belongs entirely to Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham. Why are the other guys even there? Statham and Stallone are about the only characters to have anything to really do with moving the plot forward, going together to an island to free a girl from a tyranny. Which is fine, but what about Jet Li? He basically does nothing but complain about not getting paid enough. Bruce Willis? He appears for about a total of 60 seconds, barely even enough to qualify as supporting actor, let alone top billing. Even Mickey Rourke does nothing but sit around making tattoos and lamenting his lost humanity. In any other situation I would have welcomed such exposition, but what about all the rest?The Expendables does have its fair few action scenes, naturally. The film opens up pretty much in your face, with our heroes rescuing hostages from a pirate boat, and in quite a macho fashion too. I thought the rest of the movie would be like that. We do have a fight scene on a basketball court and a fast-paced fight in the trenches of a palace, with heavy adrenaline rush. I knew the movie was aiming for this, and it is an entertaining enough action movie, just without any real punch like, say, all of Arnold Schwarzenegger's action movies (arguably the king of action movies, and he appears for even less screen time than Willis, and then in the role of a politician. How the mighty have fallen).What annoys me about The Expendables is that it promised us an all-star extravaganza of actors and most of the time that just isn't the truth. Most of the actors are barely even there. They should just have marketed this as a buddy picture between Stallone and Statham, because that's basically what The Expendables is.

The great thing is that the director understood that with many action stars you don't really want them to talk as much as have them just doing action sequences.  Fortunately, the actors that get the most speaking lines in this film are pretty good actors (Stallone, Statham, Rourke).  The rest of the gang did what they do best...action scenes.You know within the first 20 minutes that you aren't looking at traditionally, classically trained actors...but that's okay.  This film is NOT about character development, complicated plots or deep emotional content. It's about good old shoot 'em up, chase them in the car, blow them out of the sky type of action entertainment...and have the one pretty girl thing happening in the movie to keep the 'eye candy' crowd interested (two, if you count 'Cheyenne'- Rourkes girlfriend for the night..she was hot!).What really keeps the film from going into the dustbin of 'cant remember a thing about it' type of movie is that Mickey Rourke has actually saves the movie with one scene, where he is reflecting on his past actions.  That part is actually the diamond in the rough for this film.  That one scene is deserving of an oscar.

It was very cool to see them all in one scene together.  You are also familiar with the B-list action stars and the Z-list action movies of the 80s.  Heck, I've seen Cannon Films messterpieces in the theater!  Those movies were simple, didn't require you to think too much, had a few cool set-pieces and one-liners, and gave you something cool to talk to your friends about the next day.""The Expendables"" is just that kind of 80s action movie.  The plot is simple, the characters are larger-than-life, and the movie doesn't worry a lot about backstory or plausibility.  We're thrust into the world of the Expendables, and either you buy into it or you don't.  The script makes it easy for you to buy into it.  I really enjoyed seeing the huge group of 80s and 90s action stars (including Dolph Lundgren!) as well.  These guys are experienced actors and really know what they're doing in a movie like this.  Part of the genius of keeping it simple is giving these actors a chance to do what they do best in front of a pretty basic canvas.  Stallone, who is consistently better at writing and directing than he gets credit for, brings his A-game to this film.The one thing I didn't care for was the intrusion of 21st century shakycam and quick edit techniques.  I realize this movie didn't have a huge budget, and the actors are getting older, and these techniques are often used to reduce the need for precise fight choreography.  But, sometimes the viewer is left not quite understanding what's going on.  Along those lines, during the big boss fight at the end, you can't even tell which of our good guys is actually fighting him.Having said that, ""The Expendables"" is at least worth a rent if you like or are interested in 80s action films.

1311316,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B002ZG999U,buru buru piggu,"[67, 85]","The Expendables is good old-fashioned dumb fun in the style of 80's invincible, one-man-army action movies-- you know the kind: impossible odds, endless streams of bullets, useless enemy soldiers who can't shoot the broad side of a barn, and tons of stuff blowing up, whether it needs to or not. If you're here, you came to see the action sequences and the ensemble cast of your favorite action film veterans, not for the spaghetti-thin plot. Once again, the good guys have to rescue the girl. The names are forgettable and the story of a corrupt South/Central-American dictator is pretty much just an excuse for the great fight sequences, absurd shootouts, car chase, and other ridiculously over-the-top stunts and shenanigans. In one scene, for example, the bad guys get strafed from above by the Expendables' seaplane by Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) sitting in a exposed nose turret, then doused with gasoline and the entire dock gets set ablaze with a flare gun, accompanied by a requisite explosion.The cast includes some of today's hottest action stars (and some nearly forgotten ones of yesteryear), including Jason Statham (Crank, the Transporter), Jet Li, MMA fighter Randy Couture, WWF superstar Steve Austin, Mickey Rourke, as well as a cameo from Bruce Willis and Arnold. As a result of all this star power, character development suffers and most of the characters are not fleshed out. We get some back-story about knife-expert Christmas and retired Expendables tattooman Tool (Rourke), but most of the other characters get nothing to work with. I even had trouble remembering some of their names after the movie was over. There are also some very unfunny short jokes aimed at Jet Li's character, Yin Yang.Former NFL player Terry Crews (Everybody Hates Chris: The Complete Series,White Chicks), one of my favorite character actors, is always a pleasure to watch. Here, he is the AA-12 automatic shotgun wielding terror. He brings a shot of energy and comic presence to the film, even if it's for a very short moment: ""You know, the enemy will always be terrified of noise. Especially shotguns. With this big boy spittin' out 250 rounds a minute, you tell me who's tolerating that."" Even with so few lines, he manages to bring a smile to my face. This is the exception, however. Most of the dialog in this film is corny, forced, and delivered with awkward timing and the finesse of a sledgehammer. Dolf Lundgren and Sly Stallone are as unintelligible as ever, if not more. They haven't aged a day, thanks to the miracle of plastic surgery. Some of their dialog, I really had to strain to understand what they were trying to say, not that what they say matters because it's all terribly unimportant. The scene where Willis, Arnold and Stallone meet in a church is brutally stiff. I've seen better delivery from my pizza man. It really was painful to watch the clumsy exchange. Stone Cold Steve Austen is stone cold dead in this film, being nothing more than a big goon who beats people up. He has zero stage presence.This is mindless summer fun that's inconsequential and requires absolutely no expenditure of brain cells. I do take issue with the way many of the fight sequences are shot and edited, making it difficult to see the action. Jerky camera and fast cuts make it hard to follow what's going on, leaving me a bit disoriented. Other than that and the already mentioned lack of character depth, this movie was entertaining for what it is. It doesn't pretend it's something more than a guns-blazing summer action flick.

1311332,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG999U,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 4]","There was a time when you could rely on a bad action film to at least supply you with action. ""The Expendables,"" which is said to be an homage to the guy films of the 1980s and 1990s, doesn't give you action so much as a blur of images chopped together so badly, you can barely revel in the violence they're meant to depict. What's the point in creating scene after scene of shootings and stabbings and explosions when the camera doesn't linger long enough on the aftermath? Why take the time for stunt training when every punch, kick, and jab is at the mercy of lightning-quick cuts, each leading to all manner of odd angles that don't really reveal the brutal maneuvering? Did director/co-writer Sylvester Stallone think the screenplay was ready to be shot? Even if it was ready, did Stallone actually believe the finished film was the best it could possibly be?""The Expendables"" is loud, violent, and frenetic, qualities I might have gotten into had the stunts been edited in such a way that I could actually watch them. I wasn't seeing action choreography so much as a jumble of brutality and bloodshed. It seemed mangled, twisted, and deformed, like a fighters using his bare hands to punch solid brick walls. It's not a question of meaning or theme or symbolism; I didn't go into this movie expecting anything of the sort. What I did expect was to have fun, to be entertained by senseless yet well-photographed violent acts. Isn't that what action films are supposed to do?But wait, I haven't even gotten to the story yet. That's because there really isn't one to speak of. At least, not one that could be considered important or even comprehensible. So far, I've established that there's no good action to gawk at, nor is there a plot that can reasonably be followed. So what do I have left? The dialogue? Sadly, no; at times, it's so awkward that it seems to have been borrowed from another screenplay altogether. What am I supposed to make of a moment early in the film when the title characters square off with a band of Somalian pirates, only for Jason Statham's cell phone to start buzzing? Not only is this painfully unfunny, it doesn't match the tone the scene had been setting up. The last thing this movie needs is a sense of humor. Give us all the blood and bullets and stabbings you want, but for the love of God, don't try to get yourself off the hook by telling a joke.The plot, as it were, centers on a group of mercenaries led by Barney Ross (Stallone). The other members of his team are given irredeemably dumb names, such as Lee Christmas (Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Toll Road (Randy Couture). They all have their areas of expertise. After the situation off the coast of Aden very nearly goes awry, it's decided that Gunnar - who just happens to be a sniper - needs to be kicked out, for it seems he's too emotionally unstable to continue being an Expendable. He leaves, dejected, determined to show Barney that his decision was the wrong one to make.In due time, Barney and his team are recruited by the secretive Mr. Church (a cameo by Bruce Willis) to enter a fictional South American country and overthrow a ruthless dictator. During this recruitment scene, we're treated to a cameo appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger, although it seems kind of strange, what with him being the Governor of California and all. This, coupled with his character's long-standing rivalry with Barney, allows for the film's one genuinely funny line of dialogue: As he exits the scene, Barney turns to Mr. Church and says, ""He wants to be president.""Back to the plot. In this fake South American country, called Vilena, Barney is driven to do right by their contact, a young woman named Sandra (Gisele Iti&eacute;), although it's for reasons I don't think I should reveal. Barney and his team also learn that the targeted dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), is actually under the thumb of an ex-CIA agent named James Munroe (Eric Roberts), one of those wickedly evil caricatures that always has to say something witty before, say, shooting someone. Any connection to James Monroe, the fifth President of the United States? What about his 1823 introduction of the Monroe Doctrine, which stated that Americans would no longer meddle in the affairs of foreign countries, specifically in Europe? Never mind.At Munroe's side are Wickham (Gary Daniels) - who's a toff one, he is - and Paine (Steve Austin), a gigantic brute of a henchman. They serve no real purpose other than doing all the physical things Munroe is unwilling to do.Rounding out the cast is Mickey Rourke as Barney's mission coordinator, Tool, a pipe-smoking tattoo artist. He represents the film's sole engaging character, and he supplies us with one scene of such incredible emotion, dialogue, and depth, I'm tempted to suggest that it wasn't written by Stallone. How could it have been when the rest of the film was relentlessly brutal? I suspect ""The Expendables"" will please fans of manly-man action, although they would have to be willing to get past the horrendous editing, which doesn't do much to reveal the glorious bloodshed. Perhaps Stallone's real goal was to reunite with Dolph Lundgren and give Mickey Rourke and Eric Roberts an excuse to once again be in the same film (unlike ""The Pope of Greenwich Village,"" however, they share absolutely no screen time). I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. Then again, I wouldn't have skimped on the screenplay, either.",3,"Who Edits These Action Films, Anyway?",1289692800,"11 14, 2010",2010,5519,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'rely', 'bad', 'action',

Even if you already know the premise, all you have to do is ask yourself one staggeringly easy question:Do you want to see Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren in the same fighting scene?If yes: Awesome, you have nothing to worry about, and don't even bother with what anyone else says. I typically see two sides to every argument, but in this case, they're wrong. There is no room for debate. If no: What the hell else could you want from a film that appeals exclusively to an audience that wants to see that? What are you even thinking? What else could you possibly expect even from looking at the damned posters?Films with very specific purposes like these are something neither critics nor users can seem to figure out. They've never been able to get it, and seem to run under this assumption that the film should be ""more"" than what it's ever said it would be. This is the exact equivalent of going to watch Commando and going ""This is stupid."" No, no it isn't, you're just stupid for thinking it was ever going to be anything else, idiot. You already know what the film is. The only thing you really have cause to worry about is if any of the actors present get particularly shafted and aren't even central to the film (see: Many other action films that promised this and just didn't do it, constructing the trailers literally out of the only footage they know people will pay to see), and that isn't a problem here. Everyone's got their place, and it all works out like you *should* freaking expect.If you didn't like this movie, you were never supposed to like it in the first place. The film never promised you a rose garden, for a tongue-in-cheek literature joke.

I give Kick-Ass and Piranha favorable reviews without even blinking but can't do the same for The Expendables? Doesn't the title say it all, you may ask? What expectations could I have had of this film? Well, believe it or not, mine were pretty high. I know it's supposed to be a bunch of old dudes kicking butt and taking names, but unfortunately that just wasn't enough for me. Not when I've come to admire Sylvester Stallone as a filmmaker, the way I have.Stallone not only stars in The Expendables, but wrote and directed it as well; as he did his two previous films, Rambo and Rocky Balboa.  But those were far superior to this chunk of a mediocre mess. I'm all for action and killing, and had it not been a Stallone film, I may not have had any reservations at all. But it was a Stallone film and I know Stallone has a much better film in him.Where was the creativity and wit that we found in Rocky Balboa and Rambo? With the exception of a few laughs, the majority of the dialogue here was cheesy and badly written. Lame one-liner after another. And the cinematography wasn't great either. Shots are often filmed way too close and don't flow well with one another, a lot of times throwing the comedic timing off in scenes.Stallone stars as Barney Ross; the leader of a group of mercenaries known as `The Expendables'; and that's all we know about him or them; begin senseless killing! Who are they? Where did they come from? The movie doesn't care. Stallone is a master at hand crafting brilliantly thought-out characters like Rambo and Rocky. He was nominated for an Academy Award for writing the character of Rocky so superbly! So what the hell happened here?The one character in the film I did find some substance in was Mickey Rourke's character `Tool'. Rourke played him as good as we've seen him play any number of roles, and as was the case in Iron Man 2; I wish there were more Rourke. Tool comes into the story to finish up a gnarly tattoo on Barney's back. Before we can ask why it was never finished, he is done in a matter of maybe five seconds, and now we are really wondering what the hell could have possibly happened, to cause them to be unable to finish the tattoo. Anyway, Tool tells Barney a tale of his haunted past, that formed the only scene in the film with a heartbeat.Tool's dark secret drives Barney to embark on a hell-bent rage to save a girl, being held captive by a league of scum-bags powered by the movie's villain (Eric Roberts). But why? Why does Barney care about this girl? They spent maybe 8 seconds together and there is no depth to her character or his, let alone some sort of bond that they could have shared that would warrant such heroic behavior in the first place. Simply put, Tool's words send Barney on his quest. Okay, whatever. So we follow him and he is joined by his pals who include performances by Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture and Terry Crews; together making up `The Expendables.'It's an absolute bloodbath when they get there, and I do have to say that Stallone does at least get the action right. Very balls to the wall, and a ton of fun. The best action sequences in a long time, for sure. And God bless him on an awesome idea to throw all these studs into one big action flick; especially the cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.In short, the movie is like eating a big bag of cotton candy for dinner. It seems like a blast, and it's very tasty indeed; but you have a stomachache after.",3,The Expendables Review,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",2010,3875,"['EXPENDABLESSTARRING', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'SchwarzeneggerWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Sylvester', 'StalloneDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Dave', 'CallahamRated', 'RGenre', 'ActionRelease', 'Date', '13', 'August', '2010Review', 'Date', '21', 'September', '2010I', 'know', ""'m"", 'gon', 'confuse', 'lot', 'one', 'give', 'Kick-Ass', 'Piranha', 'favorable', 'reviews', 'even', 'blinking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'same', 'Expendables', ""n't"", 'title', 'say', 'may', 'ask', 'What', 'expectations', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'film', 'Well', 'believe', 'not', 'mine', 'were', 'pretty', 'high', 'know', 'supposed', 'be', 'bunch', 'old', 'dudes', 'kicking', 'butt', 'taking', 'names', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Not', 'when', ""'ve"", 'come', 'admire', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'have.Stallone', 'not', 'only', 'Expendables', 'wrote', 'directed', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'two', 'previous', 'films', 'Rambo', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'were', 'far', 'superior', 'chunk', 'mediocre', 'mess', ""'m"", 'action', 'killing', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'Stallone', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'reservations', 'was', 'Stallone', 'film', 'know', 'Stallone', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'him.Where', 'was', 'creativity', 'wit', 'found', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Rambo', 'exception', 'few', 'laughs', 'majority', 'dialogue', 'here', 'was', 'cheesy', 'badly', 'written', 'Lame', 'one-liner', 'cinematography', 'was', ""n't"", 'great', 'either', 'Shots', 'are', 'often', 'filmed', 'way', 'too', 'close', 'do', ""n't"", 'flow', 'well', 'one', 'lot', 'times', 'throwing', 'comedic', 'timing', 'off', 'scenes.Stallone', 'stars', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'leader', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'known', 'Expendables', 'know', 'begin', 'senseless', 'killing', 'Who', 'are', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'movie', ""n't"", 'care', 'Stallone', 'master', 'hand', 'crafting', 'brilliantly', 'thought-out', 'characters', 'Rambo', 'Rocky', 'was', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'writing', 'character', 'Rocky', 'superbly', 'So', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'here', 'one', 'character', 'film', 'did', 'find', 'substance', 'was', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'character', 'Tool', 'Rourke', 'played', 'as', 'good', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'number', 'roles', 'was', 'case', 'Iron', 'Man', '2', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'Rourke', 'Tool', 'story', 'finish', 'up', 'gnarly', 'tattoo', 'Barney', 'back', 'can', 'ask', 'why', 'was', 'never', 'finished', 'done', 'matter', 'maybe', 'five', 'seconds', 'now', 'are', 'really', 'wondering', 'what', 'hell', 'could', 'have', 'possibly', 'happened', 'cause', 'be', 'unable', 'finish', 'tattoo', 'Anyway', 'Tool', 'Barney', 'tale', 'haunted', 'past', 'formed', 'only', 'scene', 'film', 'heartbeat.Tool', 'dark', 'secret', 'drives', 'Barney', 'embark', 'hell-bent', 'rage', 'save', 'girl', 'being', 'held', 'captive', 'league', 'scum-bags', 'powered', 'movie', 'villain', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'why', 'Why', 'Barney', 'care', 'girl', 'spent', 'maybe', '8', 'seconds', 'together', 'depth', 'character', 'let', 'alone', 'sort', 'bond', 'could', 'have', 'shared', 'would', 'warrant', 'such', 'heroic', 'behavior', 'first', 'place', 'Simply', 'put', 'Tool', 'words', 'send', 'Barney', 'quest', 'Okay', 'follow', 'joined', 'pals', 'who', 'include', 'performances', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'together', 'making', 'up', 'Expendables', 'absolute', 'bloodbath', 'when', 'get', 'there', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'Stallone', 'least', 'get', 'action', 'right', 'Very', 'wall', 'ton', 'fun', 'best', 'action', 'sequences', 'long', 'time', 'sure', 'God', 'bless', 'awesome', 'idea', 'throw', 'studs', 'one', 'big', 'action', 'flick', 'especially', 'cameos', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger.In', 'short', 'movie', 'eating', 'big', 'bag', 'cotton', 'candy', 'dinner', 'blast', 'very', 'tasty', 'indeed', 'have', 'stomachache']",N/A
1311341,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B002ZG999U,C. Sawin,"[6, 16]","All of the trailers and TV spots have given people the idea that The Expendables  unites as many of the biggest action film stars in one film and promises to be one of the bloodiest and explosive films in recent memory. So to expect strong writing or a coherent story in a film like this would just be absurd, so I thought that expecting an entertaining action film and nothing more would fit the mold perfectly. Somehow the film still managed to be an out of control mess.The writing was cringe-worthy. It felt like we were thrown into a film that had already established a back story, but maybe that's what they were going for since most of these actors have action films that they're associated with. The dialogue will probably make you groan at how corny it is at times. If Mickey Rourke's speech about putting a Charlotte's Web tattoo on Jason Statham's ""perfect, round head"" wasn't improvised, then that is really disappointing as Rourke seemed to struggle on spitting the words out during that scene. The Expendables certainly felt like it filmed all the big action sequences first and then tried to throw together a script and a story at the last minute. One of the most humorous aspects of the film was the fact that it had to make a big deal about Steve Austin's character not having any objections to roughing up women when he was accused of abusing them in real life.With this many stars in the film, you can probably guess that it isn't very well balanced. Getting all of these action stars in one film is certainly an achievement, but most of them don't have much screen time. The first half of the film seems to be very Jason Statham heavy while the rest of the film is mostly Stallone. Jet Li and Mickey Rourke have a few scenes where they stick out while Dolph Lundgren seems to sit on the sidelines for most of the film. If you're going into this film expecting a larger role from someone who isn't in this paragraph, then you'll probably be disappointed due to how small their role really is.The film is capable of delivering some bone-crunching and blood soaked fight sequences in addition to an incredible amount of explosions that would even make Michael Bay contemplate whether or not he's had this much destruction in one film. Some of the ways that people die in the film are gloriously gruesome while the film shines brightest during the scenes where Barney's team is too busy fighting to say much of anything. Most of the action scenes in Vilena, the car chase that ends with the fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, and the finale of the film are all deliciously explosive, fast paced, and hit hard enough to satisfy most action film fans.The Expendables is poorly written and rather brainless, but is capable of giving its audience exactly what it advertised and that's deliver one of the loudest action films ever that features quite possibly the greatest gathering of action stars in any film. If you're somehow able to ignore the disconnected storyline and stupefyingly simple dialogue, then you'll probably be able to enjoy the clutter of explosive and fast paced action.",2,"A dud that packs a punch, but doesn't fully explode.",1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,3108,"['trailers', 'TV', 'spots', 'have', 'given', 'people', 'idea', 'Expendables', 'many', 'biggest', 'action', 'film', 'stars', 'one', 'film', 'promises', 'be', 'one', 'bloodiest', 'explosive', 'films', 'recent', 'memory', 'So', 'expect', 'strong', 'writing', 'coherent', 'story', 'film', 'would', 'just', 'be', 'absurd', 'thought', 'expecting', 'entertaining', 'action', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'would', 'fit', 'mold', 'perfectly', 'Somehow', 'film', 'still', 'managed', 'be', 'control', 'mess.The', 'writing', 'was', 'cringe-worthy', 'felt', 'were', 'thrown', 'film', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'back', 'story', 'maybe', 'what', 'were', 'going', 'most', 'actors', 'have', 'action', 'films', ""'re"", 'associated', 'dialogue', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'groan', 'how', 'corny', 'times', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'speech', 'putting', 'Charlotte', 'Web', 'tattoo', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'perfect', 'round', 'head', 'was', ""n't"", 'improvised', 'then', 'really', 'disappointing', 'Rourke', 'seemed', 'struggle', 'spitting', 'words', 'out', 'scene', 'Expendables', 'certainly', 'felt', 'filmed', 'big', 'action', 'sequences', 'first', 'then', 'tried', 'throw', 'together', 'script', 'story', 'last', 'minute', 'One', 'most', 'humorous', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'had', 'make', 'big', 'deal', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'character', 'not', 'having', 'objections', 'roughing', 'up', 'women', 'when', 'was', 'accused', 'abusing', 'real', 'life.With', 'many', 'stars', 'film', 'can', 'probably', 'guess', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'balanced', 'Getting', 'action', 'stars', 'one', 'film', 'certainly', 'achievement', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'heavy', 'rest', 'film', 'mostly', 'Stallone', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'have', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'stick', 'out', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'sit', 'sidelines', 'most', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'film', 'expecting', 'larger', 'role', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'paragraph', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'due', 'how', 'small', 'role', 'really', 'is.The', 'film', 'capable', 'delivering', 'bone-crunching', 'blood', 'soaked', 'fight', 'sequences', 'addition', 'incredible', 'amount', 'explosions', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'contemplate', 'not', 'had', 'much', 'destruction', 'one', 'film', 'ways', 'people', 'die', 'film', 'are', 'gloriously', 'gruesome', 'film', 'shines', 'brightest', 'scenes', 'where', 'Barney', 'team', 'too', 'busy', 'fighting', 'say', 'much', 'anything', 'Most', 'action', 'scenes', 'Vilena', 'car', 'chase', 'fight', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'finale', 'film', 'are', 'deliciously', 'explosive', 'fast', 'paced', 'hit', 'hard', 'enough', 'satisfy', 'most', 'action', 'film', 'fans.The', 'Expendables', 'poorly', 'written', 'rather', 'brainless', 'capable', 'giving', 'audience', 'exactly', 'what', 'advertised', 'deliver', 'one', 'loudest', 'action', 'films', 'ever', 'quite', 'possibly', 'greatest', 'gathering', 'action', 'stars', 'film', ""'re"", 'somehow', 'able', 'ignore', 'disconnected', 'storyline', 'stupefyingly', 'simple', 'dialogue', 'then', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'clutter', 'explosive', 'fast', 'paced', 'action']",N/A

For me, like for most posters on this board, this movie provides a dose of 80's nostalgia and a chance to watch our favorite actions heroes strut their stuff one more time.  Sly Stallone, despite his once iconic status, has not really been a heavy hitter for quite some time.  So the prospect of seeing him stage a possible comeback is another incentive to see this movie.The result, however, is quite disappointing.  Despite a strong cast and not-quite-so-shabby performances, the movie never provided me with the adrenaline rush I was expecting from a movie of this type.  That is due to both the lackluster storyline and the poorly-edited action sequences.  There are some nice moments between Stallone and Jason Statham that recalls some of the best buddy movies, and the explosions are louder than ever.  But for the most part,the action sequences are less satisfying than they could have been because Stallone chose to employ the quick cuts that are so popular in the action genre noawadays, but which only made the action scenes that much more confusing to figure out.  A lot of times I would have to wait until the dust have settled after a big fight to figure out what has just happened and who is left standing at the end of it.  Also, the under-use of Jet Li in this movie is just criminal.  This movie really belongs to Stallone and Statham; and for many of Li's big scenes either Stallone and Statham would be called upon to save him at the end.  The sole purpose of Li's participation only seems to be to provide the movie with its third big name star.  But what is the point of using someone like Jet Li if you're not going to give him a chance to do what he does best?So in conclusion, while this movie could have been a lot worse, it could also have been a lot better. Word is that a sequel is already in the works.

THE EXPENDABLES is an in-your-face action film, an homage to the great films of the 80s and early 90s starring Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Stephen Segal, and other butt-kickers.  If you like those films, you'll like this one; if you don't like those films, then stay away.As a trip down memory lane, as a rock-em-sock-em-one-liner extravaganza, THE EXPENDABLES succeeds admirably.  The plot is predictably lame: a bunch of mercenaries decide to take on a dictatorship, especially after the group's leader meets the dictator's beautiful, feisty (and, naturally, anti-daddy) daughter.  Things become a little more complicated when it's discovered that the dictator is a CIA stooge, but that won't stop our tough guys.  They can withstand bullets, bombs, fire, the elements--they're the Expendables!And that's what you get.  Take it or leave it.  Sly Stallone is in fine form, believe it or not.  Jason Statham (a genuinely good actor when he isn't kicking butt and not taking names) adds a little weight as Sly's second-in-command.  Others along for the ride: Mickey Rourke, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crewes, Randy Couture (who should NOT act, even in a so-bad-it's-good movie like this), Eric Roberts, and Steve Austin.  Stallone and Statham get the most screen time, which is good because they're arguably the most talented actors here (and certainly the most fleshed-out characters).  Would've liked to have seen more of Rourke (he's got more talent in one finger than most of this cast combined), but he has better things to do these days.But you don't care about acting or plot.  You want action-action-action, and a few one-liners, and some cool as hell knife tossing.  And you got it, baby.  THE EXPENDABLES delivers what you want in your action movie--no more, no less.*MINOR SPOILER ALERT AHEAD (though I'm wondering how anyone could not know about it by now.)You may be wondering about the scene between Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well.  It's short, so don't be disappointed.  It's predictable.  It's trite.  But, yes, it's totally amazing.

In more limited roles, Rourke delivers a soulful rambling monologue like only he can while Bruce Willis drops a bunch of F bombs like only he can. As can be expected, Arnold's cameo is short but sweet.  Lundgren gets a surprising amount of screen time in a memorable but weird even for him performance while Roberts threatens to steal the movie as the arrogant wise cracking villain.Much like the story, the action is brutish and simple. Don't expect too many complex emotional twists or turns, just the bad guys being a-holes, and the heroes blowing them to pieces with large guns in retort. Of course Stallone uses every opportunity to pour on the gore, but it should be noted that while the violence is graphic it is not nearly as mean and nasty as the violence in his last Rambo outing; it's all in good fun this time out.  There are also plenty of well staged fight sequences cast to the strengths of the performers; Li and Lundgren work a smart kung fu fight, Statham beats up a gang of obnoxious punks, UFC star Raynd Couture breaks limbs with mixed marital arts holds, while the aging Stallone gets his ""a$$ kicked.""

They still are today only with just one exception albeit a pretty significant one... in those days, Men were Men. They weren't pretty but they exuded their God-given male born testosterone with every ounce of testicular sweat dripping on celluloid. For a boy growing up in the 80's they were the male role-models and father figures that inspired impressionable pre-adolescent boys into shaping their adult manhoods. Those were the days of yore.The Expendables isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination but it knows exactly what it is trying to be and doesn't pull any punches. It tries to be theThe Magnificent Sevenof the modern action movie but doesn't quite hit its mark. It's more like the Magnificent Four and a Half (Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Austin, and Li). The rest of the ensemble more or less being, ahem... expendable. My friend and I once had a similar idea for a movie that would pit all of our favorite 80's action stars into one no-holds-barred-royal-rumble-of-epic-manliness which we appropriately called ""Cajones"" but that was back in the mid-90's when there was still a chance to see most of these larger-than-life-nut-swingers together onscreen in their prime. The fact that Stallone, now 64, can prove that he still has what it takes and show the younger generations how to make an action movie proper after two successful comebacks with his acclaimedRocky BalboaandRambois a testament that there is still not only a demand but a primal need for REAL movie star icons like Stallone that are legends who defy their generation and age.There is only one thing you need to know about the paint-by-numbers plot and that is this: These titans of manliness have all come here to chew bubble-gum and kick ass, and there is a whole lotta bubble-gum to go around. When the blood and guts start flying it makes Peckinpah look like Walt Disney. If that is the kind of movie you are expecting to see you won't be disappointed. Perhaps the biggest fault with The Expendables is that it never quite lives up to itself. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo feels like it was thrown in just for the sake of having the three biggest 80's action icons together at last onscreen for a Hard Rock Cafe Kodak moment. It just feels like 'The Guvinator' shows up to give his quick endorsement before going back to the office. Fortunately Sly has much better things to do these days than bankrupting the state of Culifornia. I was never particularly a fan of so-called ""professional"" wrestling for all of its phoniness so guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin never really appealed to me but I'll take him and UFC's Randy Couture any day over any so-called leading male action star in Hollywood today just on sheer testosterone levels alone. At least Mickey Rourke showed that not all of professional wrestling is fake with ""The Wrestler"" but ""Iron Man 2"" hardly qualifies him as a bona fide action-star, more like Harley Davidson without the Marlboro Man. One look at his fugly face and you can see that his days of ""9 1/2 Weeks"" with the ladies are long over. Jason Statham is apparently the most masculine male action star Hollywood currently has to offer up and that's not saying too much with a resume consisting of ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Crank"" and ""The Transporter"" series but I guess baldness apparently qualifies him in the testosterone brigade along with Bruce Willis whose days of headlining as an action star were washed up with the last ""Die Hard."" The truly expendable were those 80's action icons who didn't quite make the cut like Chuck Norris who for whatever reason was unable to attend Sly's little shindig. As a kid I probably watched every action film that Chuck starred in like ""The Octagon,"" ""Good Guys Wear Black,"" ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" and ""A Force of One."" You can't think of the 80's without bringing up Chuck Norris, or the poseurs like Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal, all of whom are conspicuously MIA. Apparently Van Dammage was offered a part but he thought the script should have catered to his ego as well as a bigger paycheck so Sly made his part ""Expendable.""The Expendables is a fun salute to the 80's and a throwback to the days when action films weren't trying to be politically correct and were all about blowing stuff up, flexing their muscles, delivering the one-liners, kicking ass and looking cool. To that end, The Expendables is a blast, but not a slam dunk. It's worth a matinee out of pure sake of nostalgia or a rental.

I was disappointed with the potential they had and what they delivered.The plain fact of the matter is this film banks entirely upon the draw of the cast, and doesn't deal with that well. I was left with the impression that they assembled the the stars and created the script around their availablity. Arnold and Bruce Willis are just cameos, and so short at that it could be considered deceptive advertising to place them on the cover shot. Mickey Rourke, one of my favorites, could have been cut out entirely with no loss to the film at all.The jokes fall flat and the personal drama is confused, scattered in approach and resolution. There's only two scenes between Jason Statham and Charisma Carpentar yet we keep hearing about it. Jet Li's character needs a raise, we don't know why and after a point if it's supposed to be funny you are just lost trying to understand and the humor goes past.The bulk of the action sequences seemed to be put in by cookie cutter editing. ""Ten minutes has gone past, we need a car chase here"". This film doesn't flow, it's like being stuck in a manually shifting car with someone who doesn't know how to work the clutch.""The Expendables"" is an object lesson in ""less is more"". They could have cut out a lot of the mess and had a far better movie.I gave it an additional star for the end sequence, which was pretty spectacular.

In recent years action movies have tried to incorporate pseudo-intelligent plots amidst all the glorious explosions. While there is nothing wrong with wanting a ""smart"" action movie, I tend to lean more towards action movies that are over-the-top, loud, and obvious. Some of my favorite action movies have plots that are so improbable and bombastic that it seems that they were written by 5 year old boys on a sugar high. But that's the charm of old-school action movies. The bad guys are really bad, and the good guys aren't afraid to crack a few skulls. I had been trying to fill my craving for silly action movies with artsy action flicks of recent years. The Bourne trilogy? Too much shaky cam. Super hero movies like Iron Man or X-men? While very good, they are not action movies through and through. Then The Expendables comes along. When I saw it in theaters, I tried really hard to love it. But the fact is that it was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The explosions and silly plot were there. Sylvester Stallone was there. Arnie was there. Hell, Bruce Willis was even in on the fun. But, damn it, I couldn't bring myself to love it. I really liked it, but I couldn't love it. Then I saw this extended director's cut version on sale.There it was. The action movie that I had so desperately craved for so long. The silly seriousness of it all, the corny rock music playing during the action scenes, the needless one-liners. It was finally all there. Damn, that was satisfying. It was like putting in Rambo 3 and instantly shutting off your brain and going along with just how ridiculous it is. So there it is! I am a sucker for really corny action movies. The Expendables: Unrated Director's Cut is superior to it's theatrical counterpart in every way. Not too mention that it looks absolutely spectacular on blu-ray.

This movie is false advertising. It's movie that when describing it, you use words like ""more"" and ""less"" to describe everything. There is simply very little, or very brief moment of the film getting something right. For example, a good scene where some baddie is getting their hand cut off, or a good scene of somebody getting blown away by a shot gun. But these moments never translate into anything more. They don't extend to make fully memorable action sequences. Instead you comments like, Less dialogue, more action. Less Dolph Lundgren, more Jason Statham. Also, it could have used a better story. You know, the type that isn't driven on Stallone's liking for this one random girl. The type that isn't forced to go to the bad guy's island in the middle of the movie by calling it ""scouting it out,"" when really they just didn't have a better excuse to get some action in.

There was potential for a bit of romance, but that was never exploited in favor of the action.Stallone doesn't want to risk his team with an impossible job, but he just can't leave the girl behind, so he tries to go it alone, but his team won't let him and mayhem ensues.There are good guys, bad guys, lots of guns and lots of splatter. Everything I expect from an action movie. It's surely not academy award material (it would have to be boring for that), but it was fun.I mentioned a few cringe-inducing moments, and that came from the sappy and somewhat clich&eacute;d dialogue. However, I expected those moments and wasn't disappointed.This movie was a great platform for all the aging action stars that can still cut it. Seeing as I'm older that most of them, I can still envision them being able to pull it off. It would have been great to get Jean Claude van Damme and even Stephen Segal in there, but I heard at least one of them didn't want to play a bad guy (can't remember which one). I don't think beggars should be choosers, especially with the youth oriented culture of ours. Any chance for the older guys to show their chops is fine with me, whether there is an intricate plot or not.I may not have paid theater prices to see this, but a DVD rental was well worth it. It kept me entertained for the duration. Reminiscent of the 70's and 80's action movies, it was a nice way to spend a Friday evening.

1311417,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B002ZG999U,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 4]","The Expendables is  a movie starring some of the greatest action stars of all time from Sylvester Stallone to Jason Statham, Dolph Lungren, Jet Li to Stone Cold Steve Austin.The movie was another solid entry by Director Sylvester Stallone. Essentially Stallone wanted to make an old school action movie giving an ode to its stars and 80s action flicks.With that said, the plot is very thin. Stallone and his Expendables are going to overthrow a South American Dictator named General Garza played by David Zayas. The General has aligned himself with a couple of dirty Americans that are former Cia. Eric Roberts and Stone Cold Steve Austin are the general's amigos in his venture of bullying the people of his country.Stallone plays Barney Ross while Jason Stathan plays Lee Christmas his best friend. Jet Li, Dolph Lungren, and Randy ""The Natural"" Couture round out the Expendables team. Dolph plays a would be traitor who may or not be playing both sides.As mentioned Stallone wanted to make an action flick giving an ode to its start, so the plot really doesn't matter here. Throughout the movie, you'll hear some of the actors talk about their previous roles and what they think of one another. It's done in such a fashion that it's very funny. For instance, Jet Li has a funny scene talking with Stallone about how he deserves to get paid more money to overthrow the Dictator because he always works harder than the bigger taller guys in the business. Or another funny scene is the conversation with Stallone, Arnold Schwarzennger, and Bruce Willis and Willis's character asks Stallone why Arnold is such a jerk and Stallone's character replies ""He wants to be President"".The action in this movie is very well. You have gun battles, car chases, and of course martial arts fights. The fights in this are very well choreographed. It's obvious with the talent in this movie that all the guys have earned their living fighting  on screen, so the fights did deliver the goods.I really enjoyed Stone Cold here and I thought he was the best actor in the movie as one of the main bad guys. He really did make you feel afraid of the guy. Stone Cold should get more roles like this in the future. The fight with Stallone was pretty awesome.I also thought Randy Couture was great playing the comedy role here even though he also fought. What was the condition he had? Statham and Stallone playing the ""Birdwatchers"" was pretty funny.My only minor nitpick is that there weren't enough villains in this. Aside from Stone Cold , Dolph Lungren, the secondary  villains were pretty weak. Even the General played by David Zayas he never fought, and he was there mostly for the drama with he and his blood. Originally Jean-Claude Van Damme was scheduled to be in the movie, but he declined this big opportunity. It would been great if Jean-Claude Van Damme was in it, but he didn't want to do it, so his loss. Also another bit part part for Mickey Rourke , but unlike Iron Man 2 he wasn't the lead guy, so I understand why he only had a small part here.

1311425,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002ZG999U,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","There are cinematic all-star gatherings which dazzle you with their sheer acting chops, and then there's THE EXPENDABLES. This movie won't convince a guy to sign up at the Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute, but it might make him revisit his 1980s action film collection or at least suck in his gut a little tighter, flex his guns a little more. I'm kinda bummed that Chuck Norris, Seagal, and Van Damme aren't here, because it seems like just about every other action film star for the past twenty years shows his mug in this picture. You could almost smell the geriatric testosterone oozing from the screen.Cue the cameos. When a shady CIA spook (Bruce Willis) presents a mission that even Barney Ross's rival (Schwarzenegger) turns down, Ross (Stallone) snaps it up. Me, I wasn't clear on the mission's specificity, other than it takes place on some island nation called Velena, which has been overrun by a corrupt American (Eric Roberts) and his murderous cronies. There's a hot Latin honey (Giselle Iti&eacute;) involved, and she catches Ross's droopy eyes, except that there's about eighty years' difference in age between the two. Not to be outdone, Ross's right hand man, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), romances none other than Charisma Carpenter. Alas, Jet Li's character arc amounts to his always demanding more money. He's smaller, Jet contends, and so has to work harder and should get compensated more.Stallone directs and acts. Or directs, anyway. Look, what did you expect? Certainly not a nuanced storyline, I hope. This film is nuanced in the same way that Sly is glib with the tongue twister. What Stallone achieves best here is sort of like what Coach Phil Jackson does with his championship teams, which is manage the egos. Most of the burly dudes featured here are used to starring in their own flicks, so from the angle of massaging his cast, I thought Sly did a bang up job. Each actor gets his moment to shine and show off his wares. I was amazed at Sly's rapid reload scene. Dolph Lundgren once again channels his inner crazy to pretty good effect. Bullets fly with abandon. Things blow up. Brutal fighty fights erupt. Salonpas and Preparation H are generously applied. All according to Stallone's vision. This is a far cry from ROCKY, a lot closer to GET CARTER or ASSASSINS. There are some hardcore kill shots.But, again, it's not about the creaky story. It's all about this summit meeting of action stars, past and present, and their interactions, convivial and violent. I thought that Sly got on well with Statham and Mickey Rourke, and that's fine.  Mickey Rourke's scenes, by the way, come off like he just strolled in from a much better flick. Imagine if Clint Eastwood had been in this one? He would've slaughtered everyone with his acting presence and, literally, with his big .44 Magnum.I had big rapt eyes set on the various dust-ups, like Jet Li taking on Dolph Lundgren and, later, martial artist Gary Daniels (who starred in some actioners in his heyday). And a brawl pitting Randy ""the Natural"" Couture against ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, well, it could only end with a Superman punch. Apropos of nothing, Couture earns bonus points for later, in real life, taking on boxer James ""Lights Out"" Toney and forcing a submission out of him in the first round. One big beef I have is that Jet Li's character had to be saved at least twice by Stallone. That's just friggin' disrespectful to Jet, who in his prime could've probably wiped the floor with the cast. But, out of all of them, it's Jason Statham who comes out the most dynamic in the buttkicking department. Handsome Rob is in his physical prime, friends. Critics can knock low brow cinema all they want. Sometimes, folks just want to eyeball explosions and shoot-em-'ups and sheer undiluted machismo. Concerning THE EXPENDABLES, I hear there's a sequel in the works. So snobs can suck it. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one.The single DVD's extra stuff: Sly Stallone's audio commentary; ""Before the Battle"" is the Making Of feature which goes out of its way to document Sly's various injuries incurred during the shooting of the film (00:15:38 minutes long);

Don't look for any profound messages--there weren't supposed to be.The script was like a fusion of Megaforce and some of the paramilitary adventure fiction from the 1980s. You know--that decade when the big name actors in this cast (Stallone, Swarzenneger, Willis, Lundgren...) were lighting up the box office with huge Hollywood explosions. During a recon for some merc work in a Third World dictatorship, Sly Stallone and Jason Statham inadvertently befriend the altruistic daughter of the dictator before making a grand exit from the nation and basically saying (with actions-speak-louder-than-words panache), ""take this job and shove it.""But back stateside, Sly has an attack of conscience about leaving the fair damsel (Giselle Iti&eacute;) at the mercy of the dastardly despot and his Evil Capitalist Puppetmaster. He's going back in to get her, doggone it, alone with no plan. But even Sly might have trouble taking on an entire nation by himself, so his merc buddies come along for the pyrotechnic ride. Jet Li, the most mercenary of these mercenaries, is the first to put friendship before money and commit to stick with his comrade come napalm or high pungis. Now you have an adequate excuse for a martial arts shoot-em-up Hollywood Fireball Fest, and director/star Stallone delivers, big-time.I was expecting it to be far more obvious tongue-in-cheek parody of the genre, but they took a slightly more marketable route, ensuring it's not SO stupid that young adults wouldn't like it. But it's got just enough stupidity, delivered with such finesse, that I had a grand ol' time and laughed out loud on several occasions.The martial arts segments would have been much more pleasing without all the avant garde camera work, and I could have done without all the close-ups on Stallone's jewelry. But there was a little bit of everything for action flick buffs: A smorgasbord of cinematic fight scene superstars who all get some thumping time; a car chase in which a beautiful old fat-fender stepside hot rod pickup gets shot and smashed to pieces; more exploding ordinance than the Falklands campaign; and some gratuitous gore that is either horrific or hilarious, depending on your mood and personality disorder.Once upon a time, I fantasized about making a mindless action flick with a cast like this...but when they were all a little shorter in the tooth. Along with Sly, Arnie and Dolph I would have cast Norris, Bronson, Eastwood, Van Damme, Ventura, Carl Weathers, Fred Williamson and Jim Brown. Can you imagine the mayhem and blood-curdling dialog? If my time machine could go back far enough, I'd draft Lee marvin and Robert Mitchum, too.This isn't The Dogs of War, nor is it Commando.

The nervous camera accents still more the dynamic pulse and unstoppable adrenaline.On the other hand, the music from the seventies (Mountain's Mississippi Queen, and Credence Clearwater Revival) hovers the film like an invisible curtain in order to link the entire filmic corpus.Nevertheless the film retains and keeps a close resemblance with Once upon a time in Mexico, where the elemental script works out with the required volatility according with the rules of game. Particularly effective is the encounter in the church where Sylvester, Bruce and Arnold shake hands.The smart idea to join part of the screen's heroes of the eighties was perhaps the most remarkable hook, although we miss three names: Jean Claude van Damme, Chuck Norris and Jean Reno.An entertained experience that encloses a watchable film.",4,With a little help from my friends!,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,1364,"['Somehow', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'directed', 'epic', 'fable', 'group', 'outlaws', 'who', 'command', 'will', 'have', 'make', 'hazardous', 'journey', 'island', 'ruled', 'corrupt', 'General', 'Garza', 'who', 'favor', 'dark', 'dealer.To', 'mind', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'nostalgic', 'gaze', 'also', 'respectful', 'homage', 'respect', 'three', 'memorable', 'films', 'past', 'wild', 'bunch', 'seven', 'magnificent', 'Dirty', 'dozen.Of', 'course', 'film', 'heavy', 'weight', 'chases', 'spectacular', 'sequences', 'unstoppable', 'action', 'graphic', 'violence', 'filmed', 'documental', 'style', 'nervous', 'camera', 'accents', 'still', 'more', 'dynamic', 'pulse', 'unstoppable', 'adrenaline.On', 'other', 'hand', 'music', 'seventies', 'Mountain', 'Mississippi', 'Queen', 'Credence', 'Clearwater', 'Revival', 'film', 'invisible', 'curtain', 'order', 'link', 'entire', 'filmic', 'corpus.Nevertheless', 'film', 'retains', 'close', 'resemblance', 'Once', 'time', 'Mexico', 'where', 'elemental', 'script', 'out', 'required', 'volatility', 'according', 'rules', 'game', 'Particularly', 'effective', 'encounter', 'church', 'where', 'Sylvester', 'Bruce', 'Arnold', 'shake', 'hands.The', 'smart', 'idea', 'join', 'part', 'screen', 'heroes', 'eighties', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'remarkable', 'hook', 'miss', 'three', 'names', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'van', 'Damme', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Jean', 'Reno.An', 'entertained', 'experience', 'watchable', 'film']",N/A

So when the expendables came out I thought, ""Now, THIS looks like the mother of all guy movies. And it is...if by guy movie you mean a badly written, poorly editied, nonsensical mishmash of action sequences where you don't care if everyone (heroes included) dies in the next ridiculous explosion.I wanted desperately to like this movie. With so many top names in action you'd think it would be great. There is even a brief cameo by Schwarzenegger as Stallone's long lost rival. I enjoyed the way those two played off of each other and hinted at a few of their other movies in the dialogue but it wasn't enough to really make me smile. Most of the time I felt as though the movie was saying, ""Look! We got all these cool actions stars! Isn't that neat?!"" as if that was enough to make me forget how awful the movie was.Movies like this seem to forget that we need to care about the characters first and then they can take us on a ride. We as audiences can forgive an awful lot if we care about the characters. For instance I wanted to care when Statham's character was so distraught over his girlfriend dumping him that he can't throw his trademark knives straight but honestly all I could think was ""who are these people?!"". These are set pieces, not characters. They are defined by their weapons and visual traits. You've got the ""Big Black Guy with a Big Gun"", the ""Asian Guy who knows kung-fu"" the ""Giant Guy"", the ""Knife Guy"", the ""Tattoo Guy"". For villains you've got the ""Evil White Guy in a Suit"", the ""Generic Hispanic Dictator/General"". There is even a ""Damsel in Distress"" who we never really feel is in distress but rather, patiently waiting for the end of her scenes.A word on editing styles. I know it has become popular to mimic the ""shaky cam"" action sequences in the ""Bourne"" movies but it must be done well to succeed. In ""Bourne"" the camera may have been shaky but we still had a sense of timing and flow. We felt every hit, cringed at every injury. In Expendables what you get is so many cuts to so many different angles in such rapid succession that your eyes get tired and your mind wanders. You start thinking random thoughts like, ""I wonder what my cholesterol is?"" ""I should be doing laundry today"" ""I wonder if Guinea pigs make good pets?""Now the CG. If you can tell, instantly, that every knife that one character throws is CG, then you need to re-animate those scenes. There was not one believable piece of Cg in this entire movie.

1311432,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B002ZG999U,Ian,"[5, 7]","With the age of giant, muscle bound heroes generally past us, it's refreshing to see a movie that hearkens back to the 80's and early 90's, when the giants of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Willis, and others took on the bad guys with cheesy one liners.  And while ""The Expendables"" won't resurrect the muscle hero genre, it is a nice, charming visit that's a lot of fun to go along with.The plot of ""The Expendables"" is very simple.  Sylvester Stallone is the head of a group of mercenaries who will do any job for any price.  When a job comes in to take out some shadowy figures in charge of an enslaved banana republic, his team go in to do their job while Stallone has a more personal stake in what's going on.It's a very simple plot, but in a movie like this, that's all it needs, as well as simple characters.  You won't get any in-depth studies of the human psyche, as the characters are labeled by a defining trait.  Stallone is the leader, another guy is hotheaded and loves knives, another guy loves his automatic shotgun, another is the short Asian guy who gets picked on, and another guy has ears that look like Cauliflowers.  But it works, as the characters are larger then life, and don't need any real character development at all.  Such a thing is also secondary to the numerous fights, explosions, gunfire, and one liners thrown our way every few minutes, or, in the case of the finale, every few seconds.If you're a fan of giant, hot-blooded action movies, then ""The Expendables"" is definitely worth a look.  It's perfectly content to be big, loud, and full of giant muscles.  But it works, and it's fun.  It a fine tribute to the action films as old...and as an added bonus, we get a great scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Bruce Willis all appear together in the same scene for the very first time.  It's short, but a fun reminder that some of the most memorable action heroes in film history are truly larger then life, and only need to rely on their charisma to carry a film, and that's celebrated all the way through ""The Expendables.""",4,"A fun, charming throwback to the action days of old",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,2068,"['age', 'giant', 'muscle', 'bound', 'heroes', 'generally', 'past', 'refreshing', 'see', 'movie', 'back', '80', 'early', '90', 'when', 'giants', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone', 'Willis', 'others', 'took', 'bad', 'guys', 'cheesy', 'one', 'liners', 'Expendables', 'wo', ""n't"", 'resurrect', 'muscle', 'hero', 'genre', 'nice', 'charming', 'visit', 'lot', 'fun', 'go', 'along', 'with.The', 'plot', 'Expendables', 'very', 'simple', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'head', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'job', 'price', 'When', 'job', 'take', 'out', 'shadowy', 'figures', 'charge', 'enslaved', 'banana', 'republic', 'team', 'go', 'do', 'job', 'Stallone', 'more', 'personal', 'stake', 'what', 'going', 'very', 'simple', 'plot', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'simple', 'characters', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'in-depth', 'studies', 'human', 'psyche', 'characters', 'are', 'labeled', 'defining', 'trait', 'Stallone', 'leader', 'guy', 'hotheaded', 'knives', 'guy', 'automatic', 'shotgun', 'short', 'Asian', 'guy', 'who', 'picked', 'guy', 'ears', 'look', 'Cauliflowers', 'characters', 'are', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'thing', 'also', 'secondary', 'numerous', 'fights', 'explosions', 'gunfire', 'one', 'liners', 'way', 'few', 'minutes', 'case', 'finale', 'few', 'seconds.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'giant', 'hot-blooded', 'action', 'movies', 'then', 'Expendables', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'perfectly', 'content', 'be', 'big', 'loud', 'full', 'giant', 'muscles', 'fun', 'fine', 'tribute', 'action', 'films', 'old', 'added', 'bonus', 'get', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Stallone', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'appear', 'together', 'same', 'scene', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'short', 'fun', 'reminder', 'most', 'memorable', 'action', 'heroes', 'film', 'history', 'are', 'truly', 'larger', 'then', 'life', 'only', 'need', 'rely', 'charisma', 'carry', 'film', 'celebrated', 'way', 'Expendables']",N/A

Yes, when those moves are on SPIKE TV, I'm the glutton that hogs the remote and refuses to switch the channel, no matter how bad the acting.  The story lines hold my attention, and a house filled with boys over rules any kleenex carrying drama.  I had hoped to find the  same action and adventure in The Expendables.  My expectations were high,  considering all my old favorites were involved in the making of this all-star film.Perhaps it was nostalgia that drew me more than the promised dynamite, gun play, and rolling high kicks.  I remember Sylvester Stallone when he was king of the ring, Dolph Lundgren was the epitome of the perfect He-Man as he fought for the rights of the universe, Stone Cold Steve Austin dominated the WWE, Eric Roberts played the perfect bad guy in that western world that existed between Heaven and Hell, Schwarzenegger was the cyborg that you wanted on your side, Mickey Rourke could spout wisdom that could make a grown man cry, and Willis would risk life and limb to save his soon-to-be ex-wife.This movie offered all-- old-time favorites, accompanied by the new and fresh faces of Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Jet Li, and Randy Couture.Honestly, wait for the movie to come to SPIKE TV for free.  Don't get me wrong...there was plenty of action, dynamite, a story line that had potential,  and blazing weapons.  Statham was stellar, Li was his amazing self, and Couture can take a beating unlike anything I've ever seen.  Though, despite all the action, I felt there was something lacking. Perhaps its the fact  the action was a bit unbelievable.Honestly, there's only so many high kicks and head bangs a person can take once they reach AARP certification.  These darlings of the 1980s and 90s are getting more than a tad up in years.  The movie reminded me more of the guys, sitting around that bonfire in the desert, reminiscing about all those fantastic ass-kickings they used to deal out in their younger days.

1311441,A3OWYPKRZE96E3,B002ZG999U,Jake Shore,"[3, 11]","I know I'm coming to this party a little late, but I can't leave it alone.  Last night, I finally saw The Expendables.  Part of me wanted to see this movie when it was released in theaters last year, but the bad reviews discouraged me.  Recently the film was made available on Netflix, so I thought I'd give it a tumble.It's not like I had high hopes.  Directed by Sylvester Stallone, the movie stars Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Steve Austin, Randy Couture, and of course, Stallone himself.  The film also features cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Hardly an ensemble cast of accomplished thespians, so I went into the film with especially low expectations.Somehow the The Expendables managed to exceed them.  There are simply no words to describe how bad this movie is.  I already mentioned the cast, but surprisingly, despite the presence of former UFC and WWE stars bringing down the curve, the acting really isn't the problem, or at least, not the most obvious.  The real problem is one of the worst scripts in the history of cinema.  It's written by David Callahan (?), whose most significant previous work is the screenplay for Doom. Watching this movie,  you'd think Stallone bought the story from the 3rd place finisher in a middle school writing contest for $20 and a signed copy of Tango and Cash.It's essentially a plot held together by a series of one-liners.  Bad ones.  Like, so bad you don't even understand them.  Now you might say, as defenders of the film do, the movie is a throwback, an homage to 80s action films that weren't very good themselves.Balderdash.Yes, many of those 80s movies that we love weren't all that great, but they at least had some style and panache.  Movies like Roadhouse and Commando are on the Mount Rushmore of over the top, 80s cinema excesses, but they were fun and unabashedly committed to style over substance.  Eighties action movies are legendary for their one-liners, but the story wasn't built around them.  Some were cheesy (""I feel the need, the need for speed!""), some were ridiculous (""Let off some steam Bennett!""), but they always made you smile (""I'm too old for this $#!%."").  And when they were delivered, there was no conceit, no inside joke, no shame.  Just perfect timing (""Yippee-ki-yay @#$%&!"").Not so here.  Expendables isn't fun.  It's boring and incomprehensible.  From what I could figure out, Stallone and co. are a group of mercenaries who are hired by the CIA to kill a ""rogue"" agent who is taking over some small, nameless South American country in order to start his own drug trade.  But during a recon mission, he is captivated by young woman who refuses to leave when given the chance, choosing to stay and help her people.  Stallone decides he must go back to rescue her.  And of course, his fellow mercs (all four of them) sympathize and decide to join their friend in taking on an entire army by themselves for free.  Not surprisingly, they succeed (with no casualties).The action isn't bad; well choreographed and fast.  The violence quotient is pretty high with bones and joints being broken and bent the wrong way.  Bodies are shredded and blown apart by weapons fire.  But it comes at you so fast, it begins to blur together. None of the action is in the least bit compelling because you don't really believe any of the heroes are in danger, or care enough about them if they were.As far as the characters, the only thing that differentiates them is how they prefer to kill people.  Stallone's the crack shot.  Statham is the knife guy.  Jet Li's the martial arts expert.  Crews is the heavy weapons guy and so on.  The acting, like I said before, is about what you'd expect given the screenplay they had to work with, but one guy stands out below the rest.  I don't remember Dolph Lundgren being a particularly bad actor, but his ""performance"" makes you think a drunk wandered onto the movie set, stumbling and slurring his way around, demanding that he be given a part.  I seriously couldn't understand a word he said.It's too bad.  With its cast, the film had the potential to be a lot of fun.  Stallone has shown he can direct halfway decent films.  His last two outings, Rocky Balboa and Rambo were actually kind of compelling.  The Expendables, in contrast, is dull, humorless, and I found myself checking my watch hoping it would end soon.  The worst part, however, is that no one, not my friends, not my family told me how bad this movie is.  Shame on them.",1,Ever step in a pile of crap?,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,4507,"['know', ""'m"", 'coming', 'party', 'little', 'late', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'alone', 'Last', 'night', 'finally', 'saw', 'Expendables', 'Part', 'wanted', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'last', 'year', 'bad', 'reviews', 'discouraged', 'Recently', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'available', 'Netflix', 'thought', ""'d"", 'give', 'tumble.It', 'not', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Directed', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'course', 'Stallone', 'film', 'also', 'cameos', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Hardly', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'accomplished', 'thespians', 'went', 'film', 'especially', 'low', 'expectations.Somehow', 'Expendables', 'managed', 'exceed', 'are', 'simply', 'words', 'describe', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'already', 'mentioned', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'presence', 'former', 'UFC', 'WWE', 'bringing', 'down', 'curve', 'acting', 'really', ""n't"", 'problem', 'least', 'not', 'most', 'obvious', 'real', 'problem', 'one', 'worst', 'scripts', 'history', 'cinema', 'written', 'David', 'Callahan', 'most', 'significant', 'previous', 'work', 'screenplay', 'Doom', 'Watching', 'movie', ""'d"", 'think', 'Stallone', 'bought', 'story', '3rd', 'place', 'finisher', 'middle', 'school', 'writing', 'contest', '20', 'signed', 'copy', 'Tango', 'Cash.It', 'essentially', 'plot', 'held', 'together', 'series', 'one-liners', 'Bad', 'ones', 'so', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'Now', 'might', 'say', 'defenders', 'film', 'do', 'movie', 'throwback', 'homage', '80s', 'action', 'films', 'were', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'themselves.Balderdash.Yes', 'many', '80s', 'movies', 'love', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'least', 'had', 'style', 'panache', 'Movies', 'Roadhouse', 'Commando', 'are', 'Mount', 'Rushmore', 'top', '80s', 'cinema', 'excesses', 'were', 'fun', 'unabashedly', 'committed', 'style', 'substance', 'Eighties', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'legendary', 'one-liners', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'built', 'were', 'cheesy', 'feel', 'need', 'need', 'speed', 'were', 'ridiculous', 'Let', 'off', 'steam', 'Bennett', 'always', 'made', 'smile', ""'m"", 'too', 'old', '%', 'when', 'were', 'delivered', 'was', 'conceit', 'joke', 'shame', 'Just', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Yippee-ki-yay', '@', '%', 'so', 'here', 'Expendables', ""n't"", 'fun', 'boring', 'incomprehensible', 'what', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'Stallone', 'co.', 'are', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'CIA', 'kill', 'rogue', 'agent', 'who', 'taking', 'over', 'small', 'nameless', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'order', 'start', 'own', 'drug', 'trade', 'recon', 'mission', 'captivated', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'leave', 'when', 'given', 'chance', 'choosing', 'stay', 'help', 'people', 'Stallone', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'rescue', 'course', 'fellow', 'mercs', 'four', 'sympathize', 'decide', 'join', 'friend', 'taking', 'entire', 'army', 'free', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'succeed', 'casualties', '.The', 'action', ""n't"", 'bad', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fast', 'violence', 'quotient', 'pretty', 'high', 'bones', 'joints', 'being', 'broken', 'bent', 'wrong', 'way', 'Bodies', 'are', 'shredded', 'blown', 'apart', 'weapons', 'fire', 'so', 'fast', 'blur', 'together', 'None', 'action', 'least', 'bit', 'compelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'believe', 'heroes', 'are', 'danger', 'care', 'enough', 'were.As', 'far', 'characters', 'only', 'thing', 'how', 'prefer', 'kill', 'people', 'Stallone', 'crack', 'shot', 'Statham', 'knife', 'guy', 'Jet', 'Li', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'Crews', 'heavy', 'weapons', 'guy', 'so', 'acting', 'said', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'given', 'screenplay', 'had', 'work', 'one', 'guy', 'out', 'rest', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'being', 'particularly', 'bad', 'actor', 'performance', 'think', 'drunk', 'wandered', 'movie', 'set', 'stumbling', 'slurring', 'way', 'demanding', 'be', 'given', 'part', 'seriously', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'said.It', 'too', 'bad', 'cast', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'Stallone', 'shown', 'can', 'direct', 'halfway', 'decent', 'films', 'last', 'two', 'outings', 'Rocky', 'Balboa', 'Rambo', 'were', 'actually', 'kind', 'compelling', 'Expendables', 'contrast', 'dull', 'humorless', 'found', 'checking', 'watch', 'hoping', 'would', 'end', 'soon', 'worst', 'part', 'however', 'one', 'not', 'friends', 'not', 'family', 'told', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'Shame']",N/A

Well the plot to the movie ""The Expendables"" is explosions. Lots and lots of explosions. With a fistfight or two thrown in the plot for good measure. And firing of guns as well. Oh did I mention there are explosions in this movie? OMG! What a total waste of time and money in making this movie. And it's not like they don't have any big time famous actors in this film. Mind you none of the actors in this movie would be considered great thespians of their craft. Still you have some big names like Sylvester Stallone, who also directed this, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren among others with cameos by Bruce Willis and and the ""Governator"" himself Arnold Schwarzenegger.The problem is it seems like they spent so much time rounding up all the big name actors they could get to appear and had no time left over to write any kind of a story. Really, it seemed like Stallone and the rest of the filming crew just went from scene to scene saying to each other ""OK how big should we make the explosion in this scene?"". There are some snappy one liners here and there in the movie but not really what you could call any kind of dialog. But it probably doesn't matter there isn't any dialog because you wouldn't be able to hear what was being said over the explosions. Altogether this made for one dull movie for me to watch. Don't get me wrong. I like a good action movie as much as the next person. But I still expect there to be a plot of some kind with character development and dialog thrown in to boot. I don't know. Maybe I expect too much from a movie. There are a lot of people who seem to love ""The Expendables"" and give it 5 stars. To me giving this movie 2 stars would be way to generous.

I didn't think the movie would be able to pull off the stunt of having all the action heroes at the same time but Stallone proved me way wrong! Matter of fact, he spreads the action for everyone evenly to showcase there talent. Is the story worth mentioning? NO! The highlight of course is the scene with Willis, Stallone and Big Arnold. Even though it lasts for a few minutes it is classic to see the three icons together. Some tease the scene with Rourke and Stallone (the drama moment) but it did its job and showcased Rourke as the drama guy vice the action hero of the film. The only one I didn't like was Lundgren as the big brain-dead brute Gunner; his performance was equal to his character in the original Universal Solider. Eric Roberts was kinda weak as the rouge CIA bad guy, but Austin helps him out of that jam. Finally, the last 20 minutes gives the action lover exactly what we want: fights, lots of explosions, broken necks and bones, and plenty of bullets flying. In summary this is a great action flick and it does its job in providing the goods.Bottom line this is a awesome tribute to great action movies and great action stars.",5,A Movie that Delivers unexpectedly...,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",2013,1205,"['Expendables', 'simple', 'action', 'movie', 'delivers', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'stunt', 'having', 'action', 'heroes', 'same', 'time', 'Stallone', 'proved', 'way', 'wrong', 'Matter', 'fact', 'action', 'everyone', 'evenly', 'showcase', 'there', 'talent', 'story', 'mentioning', 'NO', 'highlight', 'course', 'scene', 'Willis', 'Stallone', 'Big', 'Arnold', 'Even', 'few', 'minutes', 'classic', 'see', 'three', 'icons', 'together', 'tease', 'scene', 'Rourke', 'Stallone', 'drama', 'moment', 'did', 'job', 'showcased', 'Rourke', 'drama', 'guy', 'vice', 'action', 'hero', 'film', 'only', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'Lundgren', 'big', 'brain-dead', 'brute', 'Gunner', 'performance', 'was', 'equal', 'character', 'original', 'Universal', 'Solider', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'was', 'kinda', 'weak', 'rouge', 'CIA', 'bad', 'guy', 'Austin', 'jam', 'Finally', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'action', 'lover', 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'fights', 'lots', 'explosions', 'broken', 'necks', 'bones', 'plenty', 'bullets', 'flying', 'summary', 'great', 'action', 'flick', 'job', 'providing', 'goods.Bottom', 'line', 'awesome', 'tribute', 'great', 'action', 'movies', 'great', 'action', 'stars']",N/A
1311453,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002ZG999U,Jason,"[5, 8]","Lofty expectations are rarely met.  The Expendables is one of those unusual occasions in which expectations are not only met, but they are exceeded.  This is pantheon level action, a truly guy's guy movie, a knock-down drag-out, butt kicking, action extravaganza that pays homage to the awesome battles and ridiculous body counts of 80s action flicks.  There has been a dearth of traditional action films and heroes over the past two decades, but the old guys get together with some new blood to retake the title.Speaking of the awesome battles, they are split into four definite specialties: guns, fighting, knives, explosions.  Last first, the explosions are incredible.  Absolutely everything blows up; it's as if gas lines ran throughout every set piece on the film.  Half way through the movie I began to visualize mighty pillars of the villain's estate as massive sticks of dynamite.  The knife throwing is thankfully more than a novelty, as roughly 20 enemies on the Caribbean island of Vilena get gutted, beheaded, and/or eviscerated.  With this cast, battles are guaranteed.  Well, it's MUCH more than expected, much more realistic than anticipated, so real that Stallone had to have emergency surgery on his back after Austin throws him into a brick wall (you'll know the scene when you see it).  Last but not least, the gun-play.  Put simply, this is a Waco stock-piling, NRA wet dream.  Thousands of bullets carve bodies apart like Commando on steroids.  No less than five times did I lean forward, wide-eyed saying ""F*** yeah!""  Turn the action up to eleven, folks.  If you don't like this movie, check your pulse.The ensemble cast is everything you'd expect.  Stallone leads a group of mercenaries consisting of Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Dolph Lundgren, and Jason Statham who are hired by an undercover CIA agent (Bruce Willis) to ostensibly remove a dictator/general and his rogue CIA agent funding.  Throw a beautiful woman who needs saving into the mix and you have enough plot, and enough reason, to fly a jet into a small port town and spray down twenty or so soldiers before lighting another couple dozen on fire with jet fuel...for starters.Go into this tabula rasa, looking for minimal plot and sub-par dialogue.  Who cares?  Negotiate with hollow point is what I say.  Compromise with C4.  Adrenaline from beginning to end.  Expect John Matrix to kill without discretion, Rocky to battle Ivan Drago, Jet Li to kick everyone within roundhouse radius, Randy Couture and Stone Cold Steve Austin to dish out body slams like herpes, Jason Statham to trump his own Transporter movies, Terry Crews to blow everything up (p-p-p-p-p-p-power!), and just appreciate that Arnold and Willis are on board for the cameo, the camaraderie, and the yippee-ki-yay...(you know the rest)!!  It's that good.Honestly, this is the best action movie I've seen in twenty years.  I could write a 50-page thesis on various subtleties I enjoyed.  The only negatives are the absence of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme (both were offered parts), and some of the action was too choppy (think thirty straight one-second bursts).  Both easily overlooked.  However, unless you go in expecting Citizen Kane (if you do, it's your fault), this epic crowd pleaser should leave you cheering.",5,BEST ACTION MOVIE IN 20 YEARS.,1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,3292,"['Lofty', 'expectations', 'are', 'rarely', 'met', 'Expendables', 'one', 'unusual', 'occasions', 'expectations', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'met', 'are', 'exceeded', 'pantheon', 'level', 'action', 'truly', 'guy', 'guy', 'movie', 'knock-down', 'drag-out', 'butt', 'kicking', 'action', 'extravaganza', 'homage', 'awesome', 'battles', 'ridiculous', 'body', 'counts', '80s', 'action', 'flicks', 'been', 'dearth', 'traditional', 'action', 'films', 'heroes', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'old', 'guys', 'get', 'together', 'new', 'blood', 'retake', 'title.Speaking', 'awesome', 'battles', 'are', 'split', 'four', 'definite', 'specialties', 'guns', 'fighting', 'knives', 'explosions', 'Last', 'first', 'explosions', 'are', 'incredible', 'Absolutely', 'everything', 'up', 'gas', 'lines', 'ran', 'set', 'piece', 'film', 'way', 'movie', 'began', 'visualize', 'mighty', 'pillars', 'villain', 'estate', 'massive', 'sticks', 'dynamite', 'knife', 'throwing', 'thankfully', 'more', 'novelty', 'roughly', '20', 'enemies', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'Vilena', 'get', 'gutted', 'beheaded', 'and/or', 'eviscerated', 'cast', 'battles', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'Well', 'MUCH', 'more', 'expected', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'anticipated', 'so', 'real', 'Stallone', 'had', 'have', 'emergency', 'surgery', 'back', 'Austin', 'brick', 'wall', ""'ll"", 'know', 'scene', 'when', 'see', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'gun-play', 'Put', 'simply', 'Waco', 'stock-piling', 'NRA', 'wet', 'dream', 'Thousands', 'bullets', 'carve', 'bodies', 'apart', 'Commando', 'steroids', 'No', 'less', 'five', 'times', 'did', 'lean', 'forward', 'wide-eyed', 'saying', 'F***', 'yeah', 'Turn', 'action', 'up', 'eleven', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'check', 'pulse.The', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Stallone', 'group', 'mercenaries', 'consisting', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'who', 'are', 'hired', 'undercover', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'ostensibly', 'remove', 'dictator/general', 'rogue', 'CIA', 'agent', 'funding', 'Throw', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'who', 'saving', 'mix', 'have', 'enough', 'plot', 'enough', 'reason', 'fly', 'jet', 'small', 'port', 'town', 'spray', 'down', 'twenty', 'so', 'soldiers', 'lighting', 'couple', 'dozen', 'fire', 'jet', 'fuel', 'starters.Go', 'tabula', 'rasa', 'looking', 'minimal', 'plot', 'sub-par', 'dialogue', 'Who', 'Negotiate', 'hollow', 'point', 'what', 'say', 'Compromise', 'C4', 'Adrenaline', 'beginning', 'end', 'Expect', 'John', 'Matrix', 'kill', 'discretion', 'Rocky', 'battle', 'Ivan', 'Drago', 'Jet', 'Li', 'kick', 'everyone', 'roundhouse', 'radius', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'dish', 'out', 'body', 'slams', 'herpes', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'trump', 'own', 'Transporter', 'movies', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'blow', 'everything', 'up', 'p-p-p-p-p-p-power', 'just', 'appreciate', 'Arnold', 'Willis', 'are', 'board', 'cameo', 'camaraderie', 'yippee-ki-yay', 'know', 'rest', 'good.Honestly', 'best', 'action', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'twenty', 'years', 'could', 'write', '50-page', 'thesis', 'various', 'subtleties', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'negatives', 'are', 'absence', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Jean', 'Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'were', 'offered', 'parts', 'action', 'was', 'too', 'choppy', 'think', 'thirty', 'straight', 'one-second', 'bursts', 'easily', 'overlooked', 'However', 'go', 'expecting', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'do', 'fault', 'epic', 'pleaser', 'should', 'leave', 'cheering']",N/A

It's for the Macho or the caveman inside all of us. Testosterone at it's best. A tribute like that won't be made often. No matter how trivial the story, no matter how corny the dialogue, you will want this in your collection. There is an obvious pleasure in seeing Arnold, Sly and Bruce together, even if it is for a short period of time. I did feel sad about the way Arnie and Sly looked, though. Clint Eastwood ages well, I think. When Charles Bronson was alive, he still looked tough, even in his seventies. But Arnold and Sly? Something in the way they walked... The eyes are still piercing but the Austrian oak looked... dismembered and the Italian Stallion seemed to be limping or something.Anyhow. We all knew before hand that the screenplay wouldn't win an Oscar. But why do people seem content with that? I wrote at the beginning that the only fact of having that many action stars in one single movie is sufficient but still, it didn't have to be this way. Look at ""The Losers"" for example. It's a similar story. And it is overblown, absurd and exaggerated just like ""The Expendables"". But with the first, you're ready to accept pretty much anything. It's based on a comic book and doesn't take itself seriously whereas the second, Stallone movie that is, is soooo solemn even if it tries to have fun at times. That's a Stallone thing. He jokes about himself and he does make us laugh at times. But the solemnity, I think, lessens its wackiness.But I have to admit that there are some guilty pleasures in the movie. After the viewing, you will be glad to talk about the way Stone Cold opened up a can of whoop-ass and layed the smack down on Sly's butt. You'll still laugh about how Jason Statham stole the movie at two specific places or how Terry Crews wipes out an entire battalion within a few seconds. They are some good ideas that forces a grin on your face (Jet Li wanting a raise because he is shorter, Statham saying to his ex-girlfriend, after a impressive fight, that he was worth it, Lundgren saying ""my turn!"" when he fights Li, the little jabs Arnold and Sly throw at each other, Couture talking about his ears, etc...).The only problem, really, is the misguided importance it tries to instill. Oh! And also, those darn camera movements (too fast and too much twirls) that, again, give the impression that Stallone really wanted to give a personal signature to something that should have been taken way more lightly.Hope he corrects this for the sequel.

In those movies the story didn't matter quite as much as the action, and Stallone seemed to want to bring that feeling to the modern day. For the most part I would say it worked. You know right from the beginning that this is a action movie, and if you just accept that and have fun you will mostly enjoy what you are watching.The cast does a good job, with Mickey Rourke's character being a surprise standout in the movie. The other sub-plots in the movie were pretty weak. I didn't really see the point of having Jason Statham's girlfriend in the movie at all.The action scenes are very good, but you knew that was going to be the case considering what this movie is. They also did a good job of making it look realistic and not just over the top scenes where people do the impossible the whole time.I know some others don't feel like the movie went into the background of the characters enough, but that didn't bother me because I knew what this movie was when I sat down to watch it. Its a throwback to action movies from 20-30 years ago and if you enjoyed those you will enjoy a more modern version here.I do wish that Bruce Willis and Arnold could have played a bigger role in the film, and I question how the case was chosen. This movie was promoted as joining together some old school action stars, but then there are a few sports figures in the mix. Where is Jean Claude Van Damme or Steven Segal? I may not like them much personally, but they were big with action movies in the 80's and early 90's so I think the only way this movie could have truly been improved is if the entire cast was made up of stars from action movies in the 80's and 90's.Overall the Expendables is a really good action movie that brings back the feeling of watching these kinds of movies when I was growing up.

It is funny, and moves along with some damsel-in-distress, and a country with leaders who can be bought. The best that the Expendables offers is the amazing collection of aged and present action stars. Sylvester Stallone controls the ball as Barney Ross, who is a character that is familiar to all who appreciate Stallones work. But he doesn't try to be his former, younger self. He takes on a mean Steve Austin and is humbled into replying to Terry Crews as Hale Ceasar that he just got his butt kicked. But he is that strong, confident, hero-type, but just add in wounded father type like in Rocky Balboa.The action is creative, and some of the things that Jason Stratham does is pretty wicked. Afte a really exciting chase scene, Barney and Lee Christmas (Stratham) decide that they need to leave with a message. Lee ducks out of view and Barney pilots the Tale-Spin-like airplane. A hatch near the nose opens and Lee really looks like he's having fun. They dive and kill just about everything on the docks that sent them chasing away, and then set it all on fire.There is more than the action routine. There is a complicated relationship between a general who works for drug money, and that generals beloved daughter who is fighting for the people's rights and opposes the drug mobsters. The expendables become involved after they generals sympathetic daughter crosses their path and helps them in their need. She does not abandon her people for a better life of her own when the chance comes, instead she makes a decision that is just as heroic as Strathams killing sprees.There are some tragic scenes that bear resemblance to what is going on in Iraq, in a scene where the general's daughter is interrogated and then put to water torture, which is very hard to watch. It is filmed in a grityness that makes you believe for a moment that you are watching a documentary. There is a filthy room she is tossed in, where she screams for her life when she must realize that she is going to have to endure severe torture. It is political and severe because of the words of Dick Chaney, when he said that water boarding wasn't torture. I'm not sure if we have moved past that as a country yet, and it it clearly in our minds still.But not to be taken too seriously, this film has a comaraderie that is appreciated, and you may never see this many action stars to one movie title. Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a funny appearance and perhaps has a message for us to think about. I recommend this fun, familiar, and exciting movie. Rated R, for a few scenes that are pretty gory, and the torture scene may be too severe for minors.",4,"lot's of explosions, weapons, and super stars and some waterboarding",1281657600,"08 13, 2010",2010,2719,"['Expendables', 'filled', 'brim', 'super', 'stars', 'who', 'are', 'anything', 'expendable', 'LA', 'funny', 'moves', 'damsel-in-distress', 'country', 'leaders', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'bought', 'best', 'Expendables', 'offers', 'amazing', 'collection', 'aged', 'present', 'action', 'stars', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'ball', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'who', 'character', 'familiar', 'who', 'appreciate', 'Stallones', 'work', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'former', 'younger', 'self', 'mean', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'humbled', 'replying', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Hale', 'Ceasar', 'just', 'got', 'butt', 'kicked', 'strong', 'confident', 'hero-type', 'just', 'add', 'wounded', 'father', 'type', 'Rocky', 'Balboa.The', 'action', 'creative', 'things', 'Jason', 'Stratham', 'pretty', 'wicked', 'Afte', 'really', 'exciting', 'chase', 'scene', 'Barney', 'Lee', 'Christmas', 'Stratham', 'decide', 'need', 'leave', 'message', 'Lee', 'view', 'Barney', 'pilots', 'Tale-Spin-like', 'airplane', 'hatch', 'nose', 'opens', 'Lee', 'really', 'having', 'fun', 'dive', 'kill', 'just', 'everything', 'docks', 'sent', 'chasing', 'away', 'then', 'set', 'more', 'action', 'routine', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'general', 'who', 'drug', 'money', 'generals', 'beloved', 'daughter', 'who', 'fighting', 'people', 'rights', 'drug', 'mobsters', 'expendables', 'become', 'involved', 'generals', 'sympathetic', 'daughter', 'crosses', 'path', 'need', 'not', 'abandon', 'people', 'better', 'life', 'own', 'when', 'chance', 'instead', 'decision', 'just', 'as', 'heroic', 'Strathams', 'killing', 'are', 'tragic', 'scenes', 'bear', 'resemblance', 'what', 'going', 'Iraq', 'scene', 'where', 'general', 'daughter', 'interrogated', 'then', 'put', 'water', 'torture', 'very', 'hard', 'watch', 'filmed', 'grityness', 'believe', 'moment', 'are', 'watching', 'documentary', 'filthy', 'room', 'tossed', 'where', 'life', 'when', 'must', 'realize', 'going', 'have', 'endure', 'severe', 'torture', 'political', 'severe', 'words', 'Dick', 'Chaney', 'when', 'said', 'water', 'boarding', 'was', ""n't"", 'torture', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'have', 'moved', 'past', 'country', 'yet', 'clearly', 'minds', 'still.But', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'film', 'comaraderie', 'appreciated', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'many', 'action', 'stars', 'one', 'movie', 'title', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'funny', 'appearance', 'perhaps', 'message', 'think', 'recommend', 'fun', 'familiar', 'exciting', 'movie', 'Rated', 'R', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'gory', 'torture', 'scene', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'severe', 'minors']",N/A
1311464,A1QHW2L0RU54QQ,B002ZG999U,jeheist,"[0, 0]","Recently watched movie review:*The Expendables (2010)- 2/5The Expendables is an action movie filled with action movie icons. It is written by David Callaham and Sylvester Stallone, and it's directed by Sylvester Stallone. The Expendables stars Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Randy Couture, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Austin, and Sylvester Stallone. The film pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s.The Expendables is about a group of elite mercenaries who take on a mission to overthrow South American dictator, General Gaza (David Zayas), and restore order to the troubled island country of Vilena. The group finds out that their target is not General Gaza, but it's James Monroe (Eric Roberts), a former CIA operative who has gone rogue. It's up to Stallone and his old crewmates to get the job done.The Expendables has some fun action scenes, the shootouts are epic, and the dead body count is high. So, what's not to like? Everything else, that's what; the jokes fall flat, the acting is average, the camera is a shaky mess, and you'll find yourself not caring about the stale story. The camera time for most of these actors is not equal, and some viewers may be let down when they find that their favorite star doesn't do, or say anything at all.The Expendables should have been a great film with all of the talented actors, but it falls flat in many regards. I've seen this movie for a total of 2 times, and both times felt like a chore. I asked my wife to watch it the 2nd time, and she turned me down; she had no interest in watching it again, and she likes these kinds of movies. Sure, the film pays tribute to action films of the 1980s and early 1990s, and I consider a lot of those movies to be classics, but The Expendables doesn't come close to being a classic. The Expendables is not entertaining enough for me, or my wife, and I can't give the film anything more than a mild recommended 'rent.'",2,Recently watched movie review: *The Expendables (2010),1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,1979,"['Recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'review', '*The', 'Expendables', '2010', '2/5The', 'Expendables', 'action', 'movie', 'filled', 'action', 'movie', 'icons', 'written', 'David', 'Callaham', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'directed', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Expendables', 'stars', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'film', 'tribute', 'action', 'films', '1980s', 'early', '1990s.The', 'Expendables', 'group', 'elite', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'take', 'mission', 'overthrow', 'South', 'American', 'dictator', 'General', 'Gaza', 'David', 'Zayas', 'restore', 'order', 'troubled', 'island', 'country', 'Vilena', 'group', 'out', 'target', 'not', 'General', 'Gaza', 'James', 'Monroe', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'who', 'gone', 'rogue', 'up', 'Stallone', 'old', 'crewmates', 'get', 'job', 'done.The', 'Expendables', 'fun', 'action', 'scenes', 'shootouts', 'are', 'epic', 'dead', 'body', 'count', 'high', 'So', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'Everything', 'else', 'what', 'jokes', 'fall', 'flat', 'acting', 'average', 'camera', 'shaky', 'mess', ""'ll"", 'find', 'not', 'caring', 'stale', 'story', 'camera', 'time', 'most', 'actors', 'not', 'equal', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'when', 'find', 'favorite', 'star', ""n't"", 'do', 'say', 'anything', 'all.The', 'Expendables', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'film', 'talented', 'actors', 'flat', 'many', 'regards', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'total', '2', 'times', 'times', 'felt', 'chore', 'asked', 'wife', 'watch', '2nd', 'time', 'turned', 'down', 'had', 'interest', 'watching', 'again', 'kinds', 'movies', 'Sure', 'film', 'tribute', 'action', 'films', '1980s', 'early', '1990s', 'consider', 'lot', 'movies', 'be', 'classics', 'Expendables', ""n't"", 'come', 'close', 'being', 'classic', 'Expendables', 'not', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'wife', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', 'anything', 'more', 'mild', 'recommended', ""'rent""]",N/A

And while it's doubtful that any of the actors in this action flick actually know what the term ""conservancy"" means, it is metaphorical.  The seaplane can be seen as a Noah's Ark, and ""The Expendables"" is definitely a Noah's Ark of has-been action movie stars.  It's supposed to be a joke of sorts, and there really are a lot of bad inside jokes: when Slyvester Stallone confront Arnold Schwarzenegger the inside jokes are just unbearably juvenile.Taking the world's worst actors and having them show off their biceps may seem like a good idea, but having Stallone direct it is not.  You would expect the plot to be non-existent and the dialogue to be corny, but the movie is also badly filmed and badly edited.  The opening image is a motorcyle with ""The Expendables"" logo fading into the moon, and it's hard to create a cheesier, more amateurish edit than this. The action scenes are confusing and chaotic -- how exactly does four guys engage 6,000 soldiers on an open field and manage to win?Stallone looks like a pimp, and Jet Li looks like a dishwasher.

1311482,A23OB9FM3MUYXT,B002ZG999U,John du Prey,"[0, 0]","Hell has a lot of bonafied heroes running loose in the over-the-top, 'hell bent for leather' action film ""The Expendables""; starring Statham, Li, Lundgren, Couture, Stallone, Austin, Crews, Rourke, Roberts, Schwarzenegger, and Willis; co-written/directed by Stallone; co-written by David Callaham. If Dante had thought of better ways to stir up a hornet's nest in the Inferno - he might have sought an exit plan that involved recruiting this team of mercenaries, martial artists, and hardcore tough guys - who enjoy going into a small foreign country, tearing the place up, and rescuing a single woman (Sandra, played by Gisele Iti&eacute;). All to prove it can be done, and because the despot-tyrant (General Garza, played by David Zayas) who is in charge of the sadistic army in that little country - needs to be dethroned and the people under his severe rulership - rescued from his cruelty. The themes of 'freedom & tyranny' run clean and straight. Rourke elevates the film by telling a tragic story and how it deeply affected him as a man of war.It is solid, straightforward, nihilistic and robust 'mercenary work' replete with high-end cinematography, low-end dialogue scripting, to-the-bone acting by several truly deadly warriors (in their own right), and non-stop 'hellion warfare' - once the odds are stacked against our heroes - and they opt to fulfill their own sense of noblesse oblige and go into that 'hell-hole' and set those good people free. Similar to the western classic ""The Magnificent Seven"" with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen recruiting 'guns and killers' to ride down into a Mexican town and set free villagers who are plagued, humiliated, and routinely shot dead for disobeying a band of deadly outlaws. This film rinses clean in the end. It is a satisfying, old fashioned, profane retelling of the John Sturges' classic, which in turn was based on Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Sumarai"" with famous action star, Toshiro Mifune.All unities adhered to. Empathy runs strong on the `macho' dial-up.

The villians in this film are played by Eric Roberts and Steve Austin. Cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger are of interest. All of the actors in this film do good work in their roles.For a purely explosive action film without a realistic plot or realistic story line, the Expendables has the top level action scenes, the explosions and the firepower that makes it a very good action film.This film is action packed and marked with comedy, slapstick humor and bantering back and forth among the characters and high technology stunts.The delivery of the lines are very good and funny. The timing and syntax of the dialog are very good and depict the ex-military/mercenaries language, squad mentality and interaction.The high level of explosive action, the characters, the delivery and timing of the lines, the stunts and the photography make the Expendables worth seeing.Stallone did a great job at directing and putting this film together considering the many actors involved. The DVD also comes with bonus material, how the Expendables was made, behind the scene activity, commentary and deleted scenes.The only thing I wish Sylvester Stallone would have done differently was to feature Jet Li and Jason Statham in a little more of the martial arts action.This would have been difficult due to the quantity of actors used in this film, but would have added to the overall quality of the action.Jon Green",5,The Expendables,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",2011,1650,"['Expendables', 'starring', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'film', 'story', 'line', 'team', 'mercenaries', 'including', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Jet', 'Li', 'many', 'other', 'action', 'film', 'actors', 'working', 'crew', 'overthrow', 'dictator', 'villians', 'film', 'are', 'played', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'Cameos', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'are', 'interest', 'actors', 'film', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'roles.For', 'purely', 'explosive', 'action', 'film', 'realistic', 'plot', 'realistic', 'story', 'line', 'Expendables', 'top', 'level', 'action', 'scenes', 'explosions', 'firepower', 'very', 'good', 'action', 'film.This', 'film', 'action', 'packed', 'marked', 'comedy', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'bantering', 'back', 'forth', 'characters', 'high', 'technology', 'stunts.The', 'delivery', 'lines', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'funny', 'timing', 'syntax', 'dialog', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'depict', 'ex-military/mercenaries', 'language', 'squad', 'mentality', 'interaction.The', 'high', 'level', 'explosive', 'action', 'characters', 'delivery', 'timing', 'lines', 'stunts', 'photography', 'make', 'Expendables', 'seeing.Stallone', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'directing', 'putting', 'film', 'together', 'considering', 'many', 'actors', 'involved', 'DVD', 'also', 'bonus', 'material', 'how', 'Expendables', 'was', 'made', 'scene', 'activity', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes.The', 'only', 'thing', 'wish', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'differently', 'was', 'feature', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'little', 'more', 'martial', 'arts', 'action.This', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'difficult', 'due', 'quantity', 'actors', 'used', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'overall', 'quality', 'action.Jon', 'Green']",N/A

Many reviews on here are saying this is a throwback or a tribute to 80's action flicks.  While I cannot disagree completely, I can say that it isn't relegated to that distinction only. It is just as much a part of today's action movie scene as it is to the 80's scene.Let me start by saying that I have a wife who isn't overly fond of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and the like. On the night we went to the movies, we decided to see two of them, one of my choice and one of hers. My choice, of course, was ""The Expendables."" She made sure she told me on the way to the theater, ""I really don't want to watch ""The Expendables.""""""It's only fair,"" I replied with a gleam in my eye and anticipation coursing through my veins.So after it was over and we exited the theater, I was a bit reluctant to ask her what she thought. I assumed that I already knew her answer, and frankly, I didn't want to hear what my discerning mind already was certain it was going to hear. But being a glutton for the occasional wife-induced punishment, I asked anyway. I about fell over when she replied with, ""It was real good...waaaayyyy better than I thought it was going to be.""""Huh?"" I replied, dumbfounded. I'm sure I looked like a deer in the headlights.""It was good,"" she assured me with a smile. After that we marched into another theater to watch Round 2 of movie night, her choice, ""Nanny McPhee Returns,"" which was actually quite good, as well, I might add, especially since we had the ENTIRE theater to ourselves...not a soul was in there besides us two. Later on that night, she made the comment, ""We got to see two excellent movies.""WOW! I was floored. ""Good"" had now been escalated to ""Excellent!""It really doesn't matter that the younger generation is having problems with older guys performing in action flicks. Granted, Stallone has a few wrinkles, and he's a little rough around the edges, but he's still built like a Mack truck and as tough as an overcooked prime rib steak. His talents are endless, and he deserves to be admired for his accomplishments. Now you can add ""The Expendables"" to that long list. It was an exceptionally fun movie, and I recommend it to everyone who likes a good action film with good actors having fun while doing it.A+!One more thing worth noting. It's quite refreshing to know, and maybe younger generation Hollywood should take the hint, that you don't need to drop F-Bombs every four seconds to make an outstanding movie. There were a couple of strategically placed profane words, but NOTHING over the top. I don't think there was a single F-Word in the whole movie; they aren't always necessary.

1311495,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B002ZG999U,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 1]","The Expendables man do I love this movie. I saw this in the theater back in The Summer of 2010 & I had a ball with this movie. I remember when I heard that Stallone was going to do a throw back with all the old 80's & 90's action stars this was back in late 2008 when I heard about it I was on. Cause if you know anything about me I love the old school action movies I get that times change you look back in 1985 then you fast forward to 1989 action movies went into a darker direction late 80's early 90's movies have a different tone than movies released in the early to mid 80's. In the mid 90's the style is a lot different then in the late 90's early 2000's. I enjoy movies released in the 70's 80's 90's even up until the 2005 or 2006 time frame. You know the past 8 9 years Hollywood has watered down action movies to PG 13 not that I hate PG 13 action movies but you look at action movies released in the 80's, 90's & some in the early 2000's 95 percent of them are R rated. I mean also another thing that's been killing the action genre was trying to make guys like Matt Damon who is a good actor an action star but also actors like Tobey McGuire a horrible actor, Channing Tatum no matter what genre Hollywood tries to put him to me he should've stuck with male strippi9ng cause he's an awful actor & very overrrated. Taylor Lautner they tried to make him an action star & I was thinking you got to be kidding me. Outside of Twlight he's never drew a dime. Adrien Brody they tried to shove him down our throats in 2010 but everything he was in bombed thankfully. Anoter thing that is killing the action genre is trying to have 50 different sub plots that go nowhere trying to make it an acting piece like they are making an Oscar contender they for forget abot the main reason were watching an action movie THE ACTION! So getting to this movie Stalllone made a huge come back in 2006 with Rocky VI & wrapped that franchise up. In 2008 he went & made Rambo IV & finished that franchise up. Then he did The Expendables a throw back to the old action movies. Stallone directed it he is just a solid director. He stars as Barney Ross, Jason Statahm as Lee Christmas, Jet Li as Yin Yang, Terry Crews as Hale Ceaser, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Mickey Rourke as Tool Box, Eric Roberts as Monroe, Steve Austin as Dan Paine, David Zayas as General Garza of course you had cameos by Bruce Wilis & Arnold Schwarzenegger & Giselle Iaie as Sandra. The story pretty simple you have Merc's that do all this work. You start off where they rescue  some hostages from Somali Pirates Gunner takes this shot gun & blows the lead pirate in half it results in the team getting in a shoot out. Gunner is going to hang 1 of the pirates Yin Yang tries to stop him but he is backed up into a wall The Leader Of The Expendables Barney Ross puts a gun up to Gunner & makes him stop. So they have to cut him from the team cause of his drug problems & other personal problems. Then you have another 1 of Merc's Lee Christmas visit his Girlfriend Lacy where he finds out she is seeing another man. Then your introduced to Tool Box who used to be a Merc he's now a Mission Coordinatior for the team. He's also a tatoo artist & you get a pretty funny back & forth with Mickey Rourke & Jason Statham. Cause Jason Statham is bald & Mickey Rourke said that I should put a spider web on his head. Barney Ross goes & sees this man named Mr Church played by Bruce Willis & you have a rival Merc named Trench played by Arnold Schwarzenegger the theater I was in had a good laugh with this scene Arnold tells him that he's lost weight Stallone responds by saying ""Whatever weight I lost you found pal."" Then you had what  Bruce Willis said in response that got some laughs. Trench says ""Give this job to my friend he loves playing in the jungle"" Then you have him ask Ross why don't we have dinner sometime. Ross asks when Trench says ""I a thousand years."" Ross: ""Too soon."" Mr Church wounders what his problem is Ross tells him ""He wants to be President."" I heard so many people complain about that scene was stupid when this movie came out they complained it was only a 1 minute. 1st off Arnold was still The Governor at this point & Bruce Willis was busy with 3 or 4 other movies I mean I would hope with the sequel coming out that they would get more time. So they get this work in Vielna to go after this dictator. Ross & Lee go & check the island out. They go in & act like they are photographers they meet this contact named Sandra. Ross wants to get a look at the palace. You're inroduced to this CIA turncoat named Monroe he basically runs the show he tells General Garza what to do. Lee goes off to get a look around the area. While Ross is looking at the palace General Garza's Soldiers show up they try & take Sandra Ross tries to stop them he is attacked & about to be killed until Lee shows up throws a blade into a soldiers head. Ross takes his gun & takes down Garza's men very good action scene with Lee fighting them off taking them down with his knives. 1 of the men is taking Sandra off Lee throws a knife into that guys back. Then you have 1 of the troops pop up Ross shoots that guy up he fired above Lee's head his reaction is great ""Are you crazy you could've killed me!?"" Ross; ""You're welcome!"" Ross decides to take Sandra with them. They are being chased they are trying to get to their plane. Good chase scene they tell her that there is nothing here. Ross has them go on to the plane he goes into this office takes down 2 of Garza's men then you have this guard at the desk Ross says ""You look nervous?"" he shoots that guy dead. Sandra stays behind. Ross makes his way to the plane. Then you have this amazing scene on the dock Jason Statham goes into this hidden compartment on the plane guns down a bunch of Garza's Soldiers then they drop axel fuel on the dock he fires this flare gun then you get a nice practical explosion. However Monroe & Dan Paine jump into the water in time. You find out that Sandra is General Garza's Daughter & Monroe makes Garza capture her. Gunner makes a deal with Monroe to go after Barney Ross & his team. There is a good back & gorth with Dolph Lundgren, Steve Austin & Gary Daniels. Ross decides not to do the job. Then you have Lee find out that Lacy's BF has been hitting her. He goes to The Basketball Court where him & his friends are at & owns all of them he takes a Basketball places it on him takes a knife & flattens it he says ""Next time I will deflate all yourb  all  s."" I pretend that's Adrien Brody or Channing Tatum for trying to think their action stars. Sandra is captured & he tunts Garza about it. Then you have this wounderful scene where Mickey Rourke has this excellent monoluge cause Ross tells Tool Box that it's bothered him he left Sandra behind. Tool Box tells him this story when he was in Bosnia & this woman jumped off a bridge & he tells him after all the lives he took the 1 I could've saved still bothers me. It gives Barney Ross the drive to do what he has to do. He's going to go alone but you have yin go with him & you find out that his character is a dreamer he wants more money for his family. Then you have this really good chase scene where Gunner & some of Monroe's men are chasing them. Yin Yang had been complaining how it's difficult for him being the smallest. Ross makes him get in the back of the truck he tells him cause he is smaller. You have him gunning down the people chasing after them you have Ross doing everything to evade them. Where he leads Gunner into a warehouse. Then you have a good gfight with Dolph Lundgren & Jet Li. I know there are complaints that it's too short. You want to see a fight scen that is too short & a major let down the fight with Dolph Lundgren & JCVD in Universal Soldier Regeneration is. Great line with Dolph saying ""What are you wearing a size 3 bring it happy feet!"" It's a well shot fight it does have some shakey cam but not as bad as The Bourne films. Yin Yang leads him into a low clerance area. He gets some good kicks in Gunner gets the advantage & starts press slamming him. Ross shoots Gunner. Ross wants to find out who sent him. Gunner asks if he's going to die he tells him he got him a couple of inches above the heart. He tells him who sent him. Then you have the entire team go to Vielna & omg the last 18 minutes are some of the most action packed I've seen in 10 or more years.Their sneaking into the palace. Ross is going to get Sandra. The team is placing explosives around the palace using stealth tatics taking down Garza's men. Ross finds Sandra who they have been tourtering by Monroe's men Ross goes in there & how Ross takes these 2 gaurds down is just pure ownage. There escaping where they run into Dan Paine & Gary Daniels . Steve Austin in this scene really acted like Stone Cold when he was asking who he was with I wish that he brought this level of acting to his other movies. They have taken Sandra off to go see her Dad. So you have the rest of the team come in & save Ross. You have a really good fight  with Stallone & Austin going on. Meanwhile you have the rest of the team in a shoot out with Monroe's men. Jet Li has good fight with Gary Daniels. Randy Couture helps Jet Li finish himoff. Then you have that scene where Stallone injured his neck I'm sure that Austin didn't mean to do it cause he suffered a really bad neck injury back in 1997. I give Stallone all the credit in the world for finishing the movie cause if that had been 1 of the dorks from Twlight they would've shut production down for 6 months. So you have the team in a shoot out with a bunch of Garza's Troops they have been pinned down behind cover. Then you have my favorite scene Hale Ceaser come in with that AA 12 Shot Gun & mows Garza's forces down. Robbie Rod, Nimrod & Adrien Brody this is an AA 12 Shot Gun take notes. Garza throws some money at Monroe & tells him to leave cause he has done so much damage to Vielna. You have him tells his Daughter that her way was the right way. Garza gives this speech to his troops Monroe kills him he makes it look like it was The Merc's they take Sandra & try to escape to the helicopter. Then the action doesn't let up at all they set off the charges you have a nice big explosion. You have The Merc's go to town Terry Crews going to town with that AA 12 Shot Gun. Stallone with a 9 MM. Just insane action scenes with these 5 men. Ross has Yin Yang cut off Monroe he tosses a gernade to blcok him from gettin to the helicoper. Toll Road finish's Dan Paine off a brief fight my only complaint was the CGI was bad . Ross has this warhead he throws up in the air he takes his gun & shoots it & blows the helicopter up. Then Ross goes after Monroe. Monroe tells him to drop the gun. Then he shoots Ross he tells Ross why did you come all this way to come after me. He tells him that he didn't comje to get him he came for the girl. He takes a revolver fires at him at the same time Lee throws a knife into Monroe's back. Ross gives Sandra a share of their payment to help with Vielna's recovery. I was suprised that Dolph was still alive but hey I'm glad they kept him for the sequel. I'm sorry if I didn't explaiin the plot all that well in my retrospective. Or it I didn't talk about the other action stars trust me their in here. My only complaint is The CGI but as long as I care about the characters & I'm entertained I won't be harsh on The CGI. Stallone did a great job directing & acting. Jason Statham was good. Jet Li was good. Terry Crews was good. Randy Couture I was suprised by. Mickey Rourke was very good. Eric Roberts did a great job. David Zayas I thought did a very good job. This was Steve Austin's best role. Gary Daniels was fine. Gisallle  Iaie did a good job. I enjoyed The Willis & Schwarzenegger cameos.Unfortantly  The Blu Ray  only has features & the features are awesoeme. I mean check your brain & don't go in expecting an Oscar contender & oh yeah  I am ready for The Expendables 2",5,Defending The Expendables why I love this movie 9.5/10,1345075200,"08 16,

1311499,A25RN8X70DSZLU,B002ZG999U,JRP,"[0, 0]","This isn't a review for my 20 years ago & 2003 film series as you can see I am reviewing Expendables 1 & 2 I saw both in theaters I had a better theater experience with the 1st movie & I had a good time with the 2nd movie in theaters as well. This movie was made for $80 million it made $ 34 million in it's opening weekend ended up making $103 in it's full US run overseas was a big hit making $274 million. Directed by Sylvester Stallone who has a lot of talent as a director plus he's my favorite actor. Basically the whole backtory of how this movie came to be is that Sylvester Stallone said the action genre has went to s # i t cause I grew up in the 90's & watched a lot of the 80's & 90's action movies. Ever since the mid to late 2000's action movies have been in this dead era. I mean I will admit there has been action movies that I have enjoyed from The 2000's but in the 80's & 90's had solid action movies about 2 or 3 every month. I thought guys like The Rock & Vin Diesel were going to be the new generation of action stars but Hollywood was focused on guys like Matt Damon who I like as an actor but he's not an action star. I am glad that Vin Diesel & The Rock are focused back on action. Stallone did a wonderful job casting Stallone stars as Barney Ross, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas=, Jet Li as Yin Yang, Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jenson, Eric Roberts as James Monroe, David Zayas General Garza, Randy Couture as Toll Road, Terry Crews as Hale Caesar, Steve Austin as Paine, Giselle Itie as Sandra, Charisma Carpenter as Lacy, Mickey Rourke as Tool Box & Gary Daniels as The Brit. The story is this group of mercenaries called The Expendables lead by Barney Ross there going out after these Somali Pirates they give them the money & demand they let they let the hostages go 1 of The Merc's Gunner Jensen takes a Gernade Launcher blows 1 of The Pirates in half & he says ""A little low."" This movie has some of the old 80's elements although this movie does have a somewhat serious plot so it has a good balance of both & but it updates it. When The Expendables have standoff with The Pirates Lee Christmas's phone goes off then they gun these pirates. Gunner is going to hang a pirate Yin Yang tries to stop Gunner but he is overpowered by Gunner Ross puts a gun to Gunner head & makes him stop. You find out that Gunner is an drug addict so they cut him from the team so to speak. I like how they highlight some of these characters lives like Lee Christmas goes to see his Girlfriend Lacy he finds out she is with another man he doesn't trust him which I will talk about a little later on. Your introduced to this mission corrdinator named Tool Box he is also a Tatoo Artist. There is a funny scene where Tool tells Lee Christmas that he should put a Spider Web Tatoo on the top of his head & have a Charlotte's Web where Charlotte would come out of his ear & make sure no bugs come inside. Barney gets work their is a cameo by Bruce Willis & Arnold Schwarzenegger. I know people complained about this & said it was stupid but you got understand Arnold Schwarzenegger was still The Governor Of California & Bruce Willis was working on other movies at the time. This scene was funny I wasn't the only 1 laughing in the theater. Basically he gets work in the fictional country of Vilena. Gunner wants back on the team but Ross tells him no cause of his drug problem. Ross & Lee go & check out the island it's under the control of a CIA Turncoat named James Monroe General Garza who is more of a puppett. Ross & Lee pose as tourist's & they meet up with their contact this woman named Sandra. Lee decides to split up so they cover more ground. Ross & Sandra are confronted by Garza's troops where a shoot out breaks out Ross & Lee stop Garza's Men from taking Sandra you get a funny bit where 1 of Garza's Men is going to shoot Lee & Ross shoots that guy dead & he fires above Lee's head which prompts him to yell ""Are you crazy you could've killed me!"" Ross responds by saying ""You're welcome!"" So they try to escape they're chased by Monroe they get to the plane Sandra refuses to go cause Vilena is her country. You have a cool scene Lee goes into this hidden compartment where some kind of fuel dumped on the dock where Monroe & Garza's Troops are at Lee fires a 50 caliber machine gun & you have Lee fire a flare gun on the dock Monroe, Paine & The Brit jump off the dock in time. Ross decides to not go into Vilena. You have Gunner join Monroe's group Lee finds out that Lacy's Boyfriend is abusing her this scene is in my top 3 of the movie where Jason Statham goes to The Basketball Court he beats up thepos boyfriend & his buddies he also scares the pos Boyfriend  he places it on top of him & stabs it & all the air goes out of the ball & he tells him ""Next time I will deflate all your balls friend."" Monroe has Sandra captured against General Garza wishes cause Sandra is his Daughter. While talking to Tool how he feels about leaving Sandra behind & you get this very well done monologue by Mickey Rourke which gives Ross the will to go back to Vilena. Ross tells the team he's going alone where you have Yin Yang that is a type of dreamer who wants more money for his family. He tells Ross it's hard for me cause he is the smallest on the team you have this great chase scene Gunner is who is helping Monroe take The Expendables down you have Ross tells Yin Yang to get in the back of the truck cause he's smaller. Yin Yang is in the truck bed firing away with an Uzi. There is this guy in the passenger side yelling at Gunner that he won't let Monroe's Men do the job he kicks him in the head & calls him an insect. 1 thing leads to another they're in this warehouse where Dolph Lundgren & Jet Li put on this really good fight. Yin Yang is nearly killed Ross shoots Gunner in the chest. Gunner asks if he's going to die which I thought he died. He asks Gunner who sent him. The rest of the team joins Ross. They go into Vilena Ross goes to find Sandra the rest of the team is setting these charges in the area. General Garza wants to talk to Sandra. You have these 2 troopers that are messing with Sandra Ross comes in cuts a hand off of 1 of the guys then he cuts his head clean off the other guy stabs him in the neck where the blade is sticking out of the back of the guys neck. Ross is stopped by Paine & The Brit Sandra is taken off to see her Father. You have General Garza tell her he should've been more like her he also believe's that Monroe is behind The Merc's invading Vilena. He drops a bag of money & tells Monroe to leave. You have the rest of the team come to make the save Ross goes after Paine. Lee & Yin Yang kill The Brit. For those of you who don't know Sylvester Stallone suffered a neck injury when Stone Cold throws Stallone into a wall. The rest of the team is outnumbered & pinned down then you have this crowd pleasing scene where Terry Crews comes in with an AA 12 Shotgun & just mows them guys down. If you've never seen this movie it needs to be seen to be believed. While Garza is giving a speech Monroe kills him & goes off with Sandra. Ross sets the charges off. Then you have this awesome action scene with Garza's Men are being gunned down their supplies is being destroyed The Expendables watch each others back. Yin Yang drops a gernade to block Monroe from escaping. Toll Road & Paine had good little fight Toll Road manages to knock Paine in the fire & I will admit that The CGI for Austin's death was bad. You have Hale Caesar pick up & toss this warhead in the air Ross he takes his 9 & fires it at the warhead it blows up The Helicopter Monroe is killed & liked how it was both Ross & Lee Christmas killing Monroe. Ross gives Sandra half of his money so it will go to Vilena's recovery. So final thoughts other than some characters not getting enough time & some bad CGI this movie was awesome great actions scene likable characters the humor is great the story was what it needed to be simple & straight forward. You know I don't need a deep plot for an action movie. Sylvester Stallone did a great job directing he also gave a great performance. Mickey Rourke was very good. Great job by Eric Roberts. Steve Austin as far as his work goes this has been his best role I was a fan of him when he was a Pro Wrestler not so much for his movies. David Zayas was very good. Jason Statham was good. Jason Statham was good. Jet Li did a good job. Terry Crews was good. I was surprised by Randy Couture him being a UFC guy & not much acting experience. I was fine with The Schwarzenegger Willis cameos I knew it would lead to something bigger. Dolph Lundgren was good. Giselle Itie was good. If you are a fan of this movie if you don't have The Blu Ray I recommend The Blu Ray. You'll get some good features if you have a Blu Ray.

1311502,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B002ZG999U,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 2]","What do you get when you join together some of the biggest action stars from the last three decades into one single movie? Well, in this particular instance, you get a testosterone-fueled, orgy of mayhem and destruction that is unrelentingly violent and undeniably exciting from start to finish. You get ""The Expendables"".""The Expendables"" follows the exploits of a group of guns for hire who are tasked with the job of overthrowing a cruel dictator. However, the mission becomes complicated by the fact that not everything is what it seems and betrayal seems to be the name of the game. To survive, the team must use every skill and weapon at their disposal and even then, that may not be enough to win the day.I never would have thought that bringing together virtually every action star imaginable into one bombastic action extravaganza would work. I figured with so many egos and that much testosterone in one place, the movie would be nothing more than an obnoxiously noisy cacophony of explosions and gunfire with zero logic or cohesion behind it all. Yet, somehow director, co-writer and star Sylvester Stallone managed to make everyone play nice (so to speak) all the while creating a solid and engaging action movie in the process.The story for this film, written by Dave Callaham (""Doom"") and Sylvester Stallone is by no means filled with rich character development, drama, or an intricately conceived plot. Of course, for this type of film no one is really expecting Oscar caliber material in any capacity. Essentially, the story does just a little more than set up the next action sequence, but that's alright with me (in this rare instance). Because, if I wanted something more thought provoking or potentially enriching then I would have chosen a drama to begin with, and most likely Stallone and company would have been nowhere in sight.I know that my being ok with a movie's story being nothing more than the glue holding a string of fight scenes together may seem a bit inconsistent. After all, this is typically the sort of thing that irritates me with so many action movies these days. The difference between ""The Expendables"" and all the others is that there's something enjoyable and entertaining about the movie besides the non-stop action. What it boils down to is this, what little story there is to be found is interesting enough to keep my attention; whereas, in so many of its contemporaries the bits of story tend to feel tedious and/or boring.Speaking of action movies, it is becoming increasingly clear that Stallone has a very solid grasp on how not to make an action-centric movie feel stale or unexciting. First with ""Rambo"" and now ""The Expendables"", Sly knows how to give the audience just enough tidbits of story sprinkled between the action to keep the movie flowing, while at the same time never losing the momentum that the exciting action scenes are creating.One of his choices, as both co-writer and director of this movie, which I really appreciated, was that he allowed each of his veteran action stars a moment to shine. Be they hero or villain, each and every one of them was allotted their fair share of the violent-driven spotlight.Speaking of the stars, this assemblage of action heroes and villains proved that even though some of them may be a little long in the tooth, they've still got what it takes to kick some serious butt when the occasion arises. Now as far as acting goes, none of the stars really delivered anything note worthy in their performances. But, as I stated earlier, no one really expected Oscar caliber out of this film. All anyone wants to see out of the stars of this movie is them kicking butt and taking names. So long as they can still do that, then the audience will go home satisfied.Also, within the movie's cast there were several cameos that serve as potential teasers for the inevitable sequel. For starters Bruce Willis (""RED"") and Arnold Schwarzenegger (""Terminator: Salvation"") both appeared in the same scene and threw several zingers each others way, all the while teasing at a history between themselves and Stallone's character, Barney which could prove interesting to explore.Then there's Mickey Rourke (""Iron Man 2"") as the tattoo artist and ""agent"", as it were, for Stallone's crew. Throughout his multi-scene appearance there are comments regarding the former mercenary life of Mickey's character, and there are glimpses of that man in a couple of scenes late in the film. Basically giving us enough information to garner interest, but not reveal too much so as to spoil future installments.Perhaps, in the future we'll get to see more of what was teased to us during these cameos in the film. If so, then the sequels could prove to be just as entertaining, if not more so than the original. One thing is for certain, the appearances were fun little moments for fans of the action genre, and provided some intriguing character history for the franchise to explore later on.Overall, ""The Expendables"" is an extremely fast-moving, hard-hitting action packed thrill ride that features an abundance of Hollywood's action stars and should easily satisfy even the most hardcore of action junkies.""The Expendables"" is rated R for violence and language.",4,"A Triumph for Action Movie Icons...,",1291680000,"12 7, 2010",2010,5237,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'join', 'together',

1311519,A2YQ5O6XV23543,B002ZG999U,Kevin H. Dudley,"[126, 129]","The 114 minute extended director's cut of Sylvester Stallone's 2010 action extravaganza ""The Expendables"" is a more deep, well rounded and satisfying version of the film that was already a great deal of fun in its original 103 minute theatrical cut. I'm usually wary of so called ""extended"" or ""unrated"" cuts of modern movies as they usually just involve shoehorning back in deleted scenes that were cut out for a reason.The director's cut of The Expendables isn't that at all. As Sly himself states in a great introduction to the new blu-ray of his film, he basically started from scratch and re-edited the movie from the ground up to what his original vision and intention of the film was from the outset. He says that he liked the theatrical cut  but that he loves the director's cut. I completely agree with him!One thing that really stuck out to me is that the theatrical cut was edited in such a way that the majority of the film seemed to be focused much more on Sly and Jason Statham's characters. That is completely understandable since they were really the box office draw (in addition to the Bruce Willis and Schwarzenegger cameos). One of the criticisms of the theatrical cut that a lot of people had was that the other members of the Expendables team weren't given as much room to breathe and seemed kind of short changed in terms of getting to know who they all were better.This has been completely rectified in the extended director's cut as all of the other characters get nice additional moments that really brings a sense of how they work as a team better than the theatrical cut did at times. The director's cut seems to have a lot more heart and soul now than it did in the theatrical cut. While I still prefer the theatrical cut of his 2008 film ""Rambo"" to the extended director's cut as I didn't agree with a lot of the additions that he put back in, I completely agree with his decisions on this new director's cut of The Expendables. So if you're a big fan of the film as I was, it's worth it picking it up as most places only have it for 15 dollars right now. None of the additions slow down the pacing of the film in my opinion and instead greatly enrich it. There's also more humor in this cut too that doesn't seem forced and makes the characters even more likeable.The one thing that I need to mention is that the excellent Stallone commentary track wasn't carried over to this release which makes sense as he did that one for the theatrical cut. He didn't though record a new commentary track for the director's cut as he's knee deep in making the sequel at the moment. The exhaustive Inferno documentary has been carried over but all of the other extras from the theatrical cut blu-ray like the post production featurette and the hilarious 2010 Comic-Con panel are missing in action. I particularly liked on the director's cut blu ray the 20 minute interview with Sly going over his career particularly as a director. I would just switch out the extended cut blu-ray with the pointless digital copy disc in the original 3 disc release and make your own sort of deluxe edition of The Expendables. If you haven't seen the film yet and are wanting to check it out, I recommend the director's cut over the theatrical cut as it is a better version of the film. I view this new release as much moreso complementing the original release rather than replacing it.Highly recommended and I can't wait for The Expendables 2 in August 2012!

This is a manic romp through every Beer Film cliche ever created.Stallone taps his role in COBRA to find himself as the boss of ""The Expendables"" a bunch of hard-core mercenaries a la ""The A-Team."" This bunch, mostly without women, is a beer-drinking, hog-riding fraternity, dedicated to kicking @$$.  Jason Statham (CRANK), Jet Li and Mickey Rourke are the biggest names here. They are hired by the mysterious ""Mr. Church"" (Bruce Willis in a suit) to overthrow the corrupt Banana Republic President (David Zayas of DEXTER) of a fictional sort-of South American country. If this sounds a little like COMMANDO, with The Governator, no surprise. The Hon. Gov makes an uncredited appearance as a cranky competitor for the job. As Schwartzenegger bangs out, Willis asks Stallone, ""What's his problem?"" ""He wants to be President,"" Stallone deadpans, just as Ahnold turns and smiles.I said, ""mostly without women"" and that's true, except for Statham's love interest who gets punched out by her boyfriend. Statham shortly thereafter disassembles the guy like a Lego set. Oh, and Stallone's crush, the daughter of the Puppet In A Hat President of the falling-apart country he's been hired to overthrow.The Expendables head down to the island, where they come ashore anything but quietly and start blowing everything up, obviously having read THE DOGS OF WAR for inspiration. After they end up torching everything that moves, including the American expat who runs the obligatory drug ring (LETHAL WEAPON, anyone?) they turn the country over to Stallone's squeeze and fly off drinking beer and singing.It's not a great film. It's not even a great beer film. For one thing, the cast takes themselves WAAAY too seriously. For another thing, THE EXPENDABLES is so ramped up over the top that you have to be smoking meth to catch it all. Thirdly, the script just doesn't have enough one-liners and wisecracks. And although it has Dolph Lundgren, Stallone, Willis, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Mr. ""I'll be back,"" the rest of the crew are relative unknowns who never placed a paw print in the Beer Film Genre. Where's Chuck Norris?Still, this is an homage, not a Johnny-Come-Lately Original, and it knows it. These guys are all long in the tooth. It's good to see the 1990 Graduating Class of the Clenched Jaw School of Acting having a twentieth reunion. With guys like this we didn't need Homeland Security. Just brass knuckles.

1311528,A3LZBOBV9H1HDV,B002ZG999U,"Kris King ""Kristopher""","[0, 1]","""The Expendables"" is great! This is how the story goes: Barney Ross is a man with nothing to lose. Fearless and void of emotion, he is the leader, the sage and the strategist of this tight-knit band of men who live on the fringe. His only attachment is to his pickup truck, his seaplane and his team of loyal modern-day warriors. His is a true cynic who describes what he does as 'removing those hard to get at stains'. The team behind him is made up of Lee Christmas, former SAS and a savant with anything that has a blade; Ying Yang, a master at close-quarter combat; Hale Caesar, who has known Barney for ten years and is a long-barrel weapons specialist; Toll Road, a skilled demolitions expert and considered the intellect of the group; and Gunner Jensen, a combat veteran and an expert in precision sniping who struggles with his own demons. When the mysterious Church offers Barney a job no one else would take, Barney and his team embark on what appears to be a routine mission: overthrow General Gaza, the murderous dictator of the small island country of Vilena and end the years of death and destruction inflicted on its people. On a reconnaissance mission to Vilena, Barney and Christmas meet their contact Sandra, a local freedom-fighter with a dark secret. They also come to learn who their true enemy is: rogue ex-CIA operative James Munroe and his henchman Paine. When things go terribly wrong, Barney and Christmas are forced to leave Sandra behind, essentially giving her a death sentence. Haunted by this failure, Barney convinces the team to return to Vilena to rescue the hostage and finish the job he started. And to perhaps save a soul: his own.The cast led by Sylvester Stallone (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay) (as Barney Ross), Jason Statham (as Lee Christmas), Jet Li (as Ying Yang), Dolph Lundgren (as Gunner Jensen), Eric Roberts (as James Munroe), Randy Couture (as Toll Road), Steve Austin (as Paine), Terry Crews (as Hale Caesar) & Mickey Rourke (as Tool) is great!

Sorry, but I don't consider myself a moron. I'm an intelligent, college educated, forty something woman who happens to enjoy kicking back after a long week at work dealing with people who could make the Pope swear, with a movie that is purely entertaining. It doesn't have to be plausible in the least. It's an escape (""Escape From NY"" anyone??). It's fun!

I'm glad he thoroughly enjoyed his purchase of ""Songs of WWII Jewish Resistance"" though.About the movie... I thought I was going to hate it... previews of the original Rambo and seeing Sly's name all over the movie credits, I was skeptical. What a pleasant surprise! Stallone can still pull off the hero part, he looks fantastic for his age, or any age for that matter. Dragging out Dolph Lundgren was great, cameos by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis were cool, and Mickey Rourke is just a train wreck, but hey, so what? The crew of mercenaries were great. They all added something to the character interaction, making them likable and at times, amusing.

1311543,A3TRXPRUYVOLSM,B002ZG999U,Little Roy Blue,"[15, 29]","The Expendables is a moronic love letter to 1980s action movies, most of which weren't that great in the first place. While the '80s did produce a few action classics - Die Hard and The Terminator spring to mind - The Expendables is more in the vein of laughable junk like Commando. Indeed, with its by-the-numbers plot, cardboard characters, and lame action scenes, The Expendables pays tribute to the genre at its worst rather than its best.I'm surprised at Stallone, who is capable of thoughtful writing and direction ... whenever he works on Rocky movies. Somehow, when he steps out of Rocky's shoes, the IQ of his output drops about 70 points. The fact that more people saw The Expendables than Rocky Balboa - an infinitely worthier film - is depressing to me, in the extreme.Where do I start complaining about this film? Every scene, every character, and every line of dialog is a bad cliche. None of the characters is developed at all, beyond being given the most superficial traits (this guy is good at throwing knives ... this guy has a really loud gun). The first half hour of the film drags terribly, with no memorable action scenes; then the action starts, and it's all fast cutting, repetitive explosions, and terrible digital effects (including digital violence ... always dumb-looking). At one point, there's a shot of a building being destroyed that manages to look much faker than similar special effects in recent Godzilla films. Tsk, tsk.Needless to say, the film is politically incorrect in the extreme. The Expendables are apparently ""liberating"" an island from tyranny, but none of the islanders has any personality or significant screen time. The two female characters in the movie, meanwhile, have almost nothing to do; I think Charisma Carpenter of ""Buffy"" fame has about three lines of dialog in the whole movie. Was it really necessary to make the script so aggressively offensive?Lest I go overboard with the complaints, I will now cite one positive aspect of the film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo rocks. In one brief scene, he manages to prove that he's a much more charismatic actor than Stallone (provided that Stallone isn't playing Rocky, that is).As for the DVD itself, the special features include: a making-of special (in case you want to know how nonsense like this ever gets made); a pointless deleted scene; a commentary in which Stallone says things like ""explosions are unpredictable""; and a gag reel, the highlight of which involves Eric Roberts belching on camera. A worthily stupid package for this movie, then.In conclusion, I declare that all fans of this movie should be forced to watch good movies (e.g., When a Woman Ascends the Stairs; The Best of Youth) until they develop an appreciation for human drama that isn't unrelentingly awful.

This movie did a great job with that, People think it was meant to a 5 star blockbuster movie when it wasnt meant to be anything like that. It was meant to be an 80s action movie tribute which is cheap storyline, girl or 2, blood, fighting, explosions....thats it. Stallone for the most part had a good cast Stallone and Statham did a great job with their roles as did Jet Li. I dont think Couture or crews needed to be in this as much as some other stars, norris, segal ect. Austin plays a great heel and Dolph Lundgren gets my acting award/notice for his role as gunnar he did an amazing job playing the druggy mercenary, he was the tweener or neither bad nor good guy, he played both. The last thing I would of changed would be Willis and swartzenager deserve longer roles. especially willis along with stallone, statham and lundgren hes an action legend. Would I recommened this film? Yes I recommened it to open minded people who go into it thinking its a tribute to 80s action, not recommeneded who think Stallone was trying to make a 5 star blockbuster, This movie does a great job showing the brotherhood of the group and the emotion of the memebers. In the end I say see it I loved it im sure with knowing what its meant to be you will as well. Blu Ray or dvd, on this movie defanitly go with the Blu Ray as all action movies its much better picture and sound quality on blu ray youll enjoy the fights and explosions much more on blu. hope this helps enjoy.",5,I love this film it was great for what stallone and company were aiming for.,1298592000,"02 25, 2011",2011,1595,"['hear', 'alot', 'people', 'bash', 'movie', 'reasons', 'are', 'babble', 'Stallone', 'set', 'out', 'make', 'Tribute', '80s', 'action', 'movies', 'movie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'People', 'think', 'was', 'meant', '5', 'star', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'when', 'wasnt', 'meant', 'be', 'anything', 'was', 'meant', 'be', '80s', 'action', 'movie', 'tribute', 'cheap', 'storyline', 'girl', '2', 'blood', 'fighting', 'explosions', 'Stallone', 'most', 'part', 'had', 'good', 'cast', 'Stallone', 'Statham', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'did', 'Jet', 'Li', 'dont', 'think', 'Couture', 'crews', 'needed', 'be', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'stars', 'norris', 'segal', 'ect', 'Austin', 'great', 'heel', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'acting', 'award/notice', 'role', 'gunnar', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'playing', 'druggy', 'mercenary', 'was', 'tweener', 'bad', 'good', 'guy', 'played', 'last', 'thing', 'would', 'changed', 'would', 'be', 'Willis', 'swartzenager', 'deserve', 'longer', 'roles', 'especially', 'willis', 'stallone', 'statham', 'lundgren', 'hes', 'action', 'legend', 'Would', 'recommened', 'film', 'Yes', 'recommened', 'open', 'minded', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'thinking', 'tribute', '80s', 'action', 'not', 'recommeneded', 'who', 'think', 'Stallone', 'was', 'trying', 'make', '5', 'star', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'showing', 'brotherhood', 'group', 'emotion', 'memebers', 'end', 'say', 'see', 'loved', 'sure', 'knowing', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'will', 'as', 'well', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'dvd', 'movie', 'defanitly', 'go', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'action', 'movies', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'blu', 'ray', 'youll', 'enjoy', 'fights', 'explosions', 'much', 'more', 'blu', 'hope', 'enjoy']",N/A

1311558,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B002ZG999U,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","""The Expendables"" is a merry cheerful genocide between old friends &agrave; la sauce testosterone, a very violent and in the same time surprisingly tender, nostalgic, full of humour and less than half serious movie - and I loved every minute of it!The story is in principle about a group of mercenaries, many of them a little bit aged, who are hired by the CIA to eliminate the military dictator ruling a little island in the Caribbean - but the plot is really really NOT important, and so it will not be discussed further.The team of mercenaries is small but lethal (of course!). Its leader Barney Ross is (of course!) played by Stallone himself, who also wrote the scenario and directed the film. Ross is the oldest member of the team; he is also a man of few words, without much personal life, very calm and slightly sad. His great pride is to be the fastest man to draw and shoot the gun - ""Only light is faster""...The second in command, Lee Christmas, is played by Jason Statham, who gives an IMPRESSIVE performance!! Christmas is much younger than his commander (and best friend), much more extraverted and with a gorgeous, although unfaithful girlfriend played by Charisma Carpenter. He is an excellent marksman and an accomplished martial arts expert, but his personal specialty is knife fight and especially knife throwing. In homage to the ""Magnificent seven"" old western classic, Ross and Christmas have at every possible occasion a friendly speed competition between knife and revolver...The third most important member of the team is Gunner Jensen, a gigantic sociopathic and borderline insane sniper played with great brio by Dolph Lundgren - who gives in this movie his (in my modest opinion) best screen performance ever. Considering the fact that Lundgren almost killed (accidentally) Stallone when they turned ""Rocky IV"" (Sly spend eight days in ICU), their reunion is a particularly touching cinema moment.Number four is Ying Yang, played by Jet Li. Much shorter and smaller than his pals, Yang is also a good shooter but (obviously) he is the most dangerous in close combat - although his character clearly also is no more in his prime and will realise it during this mission...The other members of the team, Toll Road (ex-wrestler Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (ex-footballer Terry Crews) have less screen time, but they also have their stories to tell and they add some flavour to the whole thing.Other than the names of some of the mercenaries, the big gag which I appreciated the most is that they all have deep and concerning issues: Ross has the aging problem, Christmas has a girlfriend problem, Jensen has an addiction problem, Yang has money troubles, Road has depression issues (and the whole cinema went amok with laughter when he confessed why) and Caesar has a fixation on absolutely enormous guns, which is most of the times a sign of..., well, you know what kind of problem...)))Stallone's team is assisted by a former soldier and mercenary known only as Tool (played by Mickey Rourke), who now is retired and earns his living officially by making tattoos to bikers and exotic dancers - but in fact he is a go-between arranging ""jobs"" for the mercenaries. Mickey Rourke gives in this movie a great performance and it is a pure pleasure watching him on the screen.This testosterone laced ensemble will have to face not only the usual hordes of evil gun fodder but also three particularly nasty bad guys: a fiendish former CIA agent turned free lance criminal (Eric Roberts) and his two vile and brutish henchmen: Paine (played by ex-wrestler ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin) and Brit (played by kickboxer and martial arts expert Gary Daniels). The two apocalyptic close quarter fights between Ross and Paine and between Christmas, Yang and Brit towards the end of the movie are a particularly great treat. Martial arts shown in those duels are nothing like karate from Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movies - they look rather like battlefield fighting styles (Israeli krav maga or Soviet sambo), very violent and brutal and designed to kill rather than to display one's ability.As almost everybody probably already knows there is one scene in the movie when Stallone meets Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This short scene takes place in a church - and I am almost certain that this is homage to the scene from Sergio Leone's most famous western, when the three heroes meet in a cemetery... Although short, the church scene is a simply incredible moment of cinema! In my modest opinion even if somebody got a Nobel Prize, found the cure for cancer or climbed Mount Everest wearing only strings, still his/her life is not complete without watching the church scene from ""Expendables""...)))The cast is clearly impressive, but what makes this movie so enjoyable is the tone Stallone adopted for the whole movie. No matter how much we try, it is simply impossible to take this film seriously. The violence is certainly omnipresent and very graphic, but it is also so exaggerated that it finally starts to have an almost comic effect. Stallone also took care to soften the violence of fights by giving the ""bad guys"" face paintings which make them look more like plastic figures than real human beings - which gave as final result more the impression of a video game for teenagers than a real fight.Another great thing is that this movie has many surprisingly touching and even tender moments. Stallone did a good choice by giving his character a soft touch: as he gets old he clearly regrets less his youth than the fact that he does not have any family, other than the handful of desperados he hangs with. He also clearly has some bad things on the conscience and as his life enters its last stage, he longs for some redemption. This is why Ross decides to commit himself so heavily in this ""job"" - not only to earn his wage, but also to save an innocent person... who reminds him of a daughter he never had... And finally the relation between the whole team (and Tool) reminds one of an extended family or tribe reunion - with Rourke and Stallone playing the role of aging tribal ancestors, watching with tender care (and also some concern) their young and not so young braves.I enjoyed this movie greatly and I really hope that there will be a sequel - if possible with Chuck Norris making at least one cameo! Another great idea somebody launched on internet is an ""oestrogen"" version of ""Expendables"" - a remake with an exclusively feminine cast, with Sigourney Weaver, Lucy Lawless and Michelle Yeoh taking Stallone, Lundgren and Jet Li roles... )))The title of this review (which was inspired by a not so good Mel Gibson's movie) reflects quite well my feelings, when I left the cinema. This movie - and especially the ending - made me feel some nostalgia, gave me a lot of fun, but it also made me feel good. I will certainly buy the DVD as soon as it is available and I will watch it again from time to time to remind me of the old good action movies from the 80s, a time when I was an action movie fan...

1311570,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG999U,Mark Turner,"[1, 2]","I love action films. I've always been a sucker for those movies that featured larger than life heroes taking on all odds to beat the bad guys. When those movies changed to feature heroes that were not always quite pure I still loved seeing them. When THE EXPENDABLES was released featuring not one but a number of action heroes on screen together I thought it was fantastic. This hadn't been done since the sixties when films like THE GREAT ESCAPE or THE DIRTY DOZEN were made.If you haven't seen the movie it tells the story of Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), the leader of a crew of for hire mercenaries that take on almost any job. The film opens with them rescuing a group of people taken hostage by pirates. Barney and his crew offer them the option to leave peacefully once and when they refuse they are all taken out with ""extreme prejudice"", graphically so. But when one of his team goes too far, even Barney sets him aside and refuses to use him on their next mission until he cleans himself up mentally.Getting that next mission is fun in itself. Barney meets with a mysterious stranger played by Bruce Willis in a church. Willis has also called in someone else to offer them the job played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Seeing these three icons of action films on the screen at the same time is a rare treat. Arnold turns the job down but Ross decides to recon the situation and see if it's possible to achieve.Taking his right hand man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) with him, they scope out the small South American island that's run by a small time dictator being propped up by an ex-CIA agent (Eric Roberts) whose using the people and the island for his drug operation. The people on the island, led by the dictator's daughter Sandra, are hoping to revolt. Ross figures out that his contractor is probably CIA and wants to control the island for the company. But something about the woman's resolve to stay on the island and try to make it better touches him. He and Christmas escape from the island after nearly being caught and he makes the decision to take on the job.The team of the Expendables includes Toll Road (Randy Coutre), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and Yin Yang (Jet Li) along with Ross and Christmas. Each has their own specialty in fighting technique and all will come in handy as they face off against Roberts men on the island which include WWE star Stone Cold Steve Austin and martial arts star Gary Daniels. These include some of the best fight scenes ever filmed.The movie is filled with explosions, fight scenes and heroic turns of events that make these mercs more human than most that shows a caring side to them as well as the hire for money side. You also witness a camaraderie and loyalty among the group that is rare in films these days. But most of all you have one of the best most high octane action films made in years.Having been a while since I saw the film originally I wasn't sure at first what made this extended cut different. In retrospect I realized that there was more background and involvement with the entire crew, including part time member Mickey Rourke, than there was in the original release. This fills out the team better than at first and makes them more interesting as well.Work on the sequel has already begun and more testosterone has been added by including both Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme as well. The only action hero that seems to be missing is Steven Segal and Danny Trejo but maybe they'll be around for a third film, who knows?",5,ACTION AT IT'S BEST,1332806400,"03 27, 2012",2012,3509,"['love', 'action', 'films', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'sucker', 'movies', 'featured', 'larger', 'life', 'heroes', 'taking', 'odds', 'beat', 'bad', 'guys', 'When', 'movies', 'changed', 'feature', 'heroes', 'were', 'not', 'always', 'quite', 'pure', 'still', 'loved', 'seeing', 'When', 'EXPENDABLES', 'was', 'released', 'featuring', 'not', 'one', 'number', 'action', 'heroes', 'screen', 'together', 'thought', 'was', 'fantastic', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'sixties', 'when', 'films', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'ESCAPE', 'THE', 'DIRTY', 'DOZEN', 'were', 'made.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'story', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'leader', 'crew', 'hire', 'mercenaries', 'take', 'almost', 'job', 'film', 'rescuing', 'group', 'people', 'taken', 'hostage', 'pirates', 'Barney', 'crew', 'offer', 'option', 'leave', 'peacefully', 'once', 'when', 'refuse', 'are', 'taken', 'out', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'graphically', 'so', 'when', 'one', 'team', 'too', 'far', 'even', 'Barney', 'aside', 'use', 'next', 'mission', 'up', 'mentally.Getting', 'next', 'mission', 'fun', 'Barney', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'church', 'Willis', 'also', 'called', 'someone', 'else', 'offer', 'job', 'played', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Seeing', 'three', 'icons', 'action', 'films', 'screen', 'same', 'time', 'rare', 'treat', 'Arnold', 'job', 'down', 'Ross', 'recon', 'situation', 'see', 'possible', 'achieve.Taking', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Lee', 'Christmas', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'scope', 'small', 'South', 'American', 'island', 'run', 'small', 'time', 'dictator', 'being', 'propped', 'up', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'using', 'people', 'island', 'drug', 'operation', 'people', 'island', 'led', 'dictator', 'daughter', 'Sandra', 'are', 'hoping', 'revolt', 'Ross', 'out', 'contractor', 'probably', 'CIA', 'control', 'island', 'company', 'something', 'woman', 'resolve', 'stay', 'island', 'try', 'make', 'better', 'Christmas', 'escape', 'island', 'nearly', 'being', 'caught', 'decision', 'take', 'job.The', 'team', 'Expendables', 'Toll', 'Road', 'Randy', 'Coutre', 'Hale', 'Caesar', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Ross', 'Christmas', 'own', 'specialty', 'fighting', 'technique', 'will', 'come', 'handy', 'face', 'off', 'Roberts', 'men', 'island', 'include', 'WWE', 'star', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'martial', 'arts', 'star', 'Gary', 'Daniels', 'include', 'best', 'fight', 'scenes', 'ever', 'filmed.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'explosions', 'fight', 'scenes', 'heroic', 'turns', 'events', 'make', 'mercs', 'more', 'human', 'most', 'caring', 'side', 'as', 'well', 'hire', 'money', 'side', 'also', 'witness', 'camaraderie', 'loyalty', 'group', 'rare', 'films', 'days', 'most', 'have', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'high', 'octane', 'action', 'films', 'made', 'years.Having', 'been', 'while', 'saw', 'film', 'originally', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'what', 'made', 'extended', 'cut', 'different', 'retrospect', 'realized', 'was', 'more', 'background', 'involvement', 'entire', 'crew', 'including', 'part', 'time', 'member', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'was', 'original', 'release', 'out', 'team', 'better', 'first', 'more', 'interesting', 'well.Work', 'sequel', 'already', 'begun', 'more', 'testosterone', 'been', 'added', 'including', 'Chuck', 'Norris', 'Jean-Claude', 'Van', 'Damme', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'action', 'hero', 'be', 'missing', 'Steven', 'Segal', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'be', 'around', 'third', 'film', 'who']",N/A

The Expendables is meant to be a pure action movie.  There is a plot, though you really can't figure out what it is.  Some of the scenes are as awkward as that moment when you can't decide to either shake hands or hug and at times the script seems forced.  But if you want a typical shoot em up tough guy movie then this is spot on.  Ladies be warned, if enough of us men get together and watch this the testosterone alone is going to destory the house.When people told me this movie was low budget, I had really expected worse.  I must say that I was surprised with how it all turned out.  Sure it wasn't the best, but 90% of the scenes were extremely well done and most of the action was maxed out.  A bit of a slow start but once it gets to rolling it doesn't stop.  I was disappointed in the star-studded cast.  The meeting between Bruce Willis, Stallone and Schwarzenegger seems to be more of an empty gesture to fans.  Expendables could have existed fine without this scene and it is confusing, seems to be a space filler, and just an opprotunity to give Willis and the Governator a few seconds of time. Statham did his usual five star job, Jet Li was the kind of character you just have to love, and Rourke was off the chain entertaining as a tattoo artist bad a** named Tool.  Steve Austin?  Awesome actor, baaaaaaad character.

1311587,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B002ZG999U,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 2]","""The Expendables"" is an action film that's less about the action and more about the 80s retread cast.  Where else can Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) face off once more? Or watch Jet Li face off against Lundgren? Or witness Jason Statham compete in a knife throwing contest with Stallone? Or watch Mickey Rourke lecture Stallone? Or listen to Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Stallone quip wise in a church? Nowhere else!  Depending on whether or not you find these kinds of face-offs intriguing will determine your level of interest in this film.That's it.  The characters' names and back stories mean less to the film than the actors themselves, whose legendary oeuvre make it impossible to see them as anything else. This is not a film where Jet Li plays the demolitions expert and Stallone is the martial artist.  Everyone fits comfortably back into their own roles like a well-worn glove and embraces it with gusto as they take on the actor known for arch-villainy across all of Syfy-dom, Eric Roberts.Our motley team of mercenaries belongs to a biker gang known as The Expendables, based in New Orleans. There's the leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), stabby guy Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), sniper Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), heavy weapons guy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and blow-things-up guy Toll Road (Randy Couture). Their workaday rhythm of blasting bad guys goes south when Jensen loses it during a mission and Christmas discovers his girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) has left him for another man. That's what passes for character development.In an aging warrior dialogue reminiscent of Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" Ross wears his military mantle with a heavy brow.  He no longer fights for anything - it's part of being a mercenary after all - and without family to speak of he longs to be passionate about something, lest he turn into a raving psychopath like Jensen. The film reaches its spiritual apex in a dialogue between Ross and Tool (Mickey Rourke), who does more acting in five minutes than the entire crew manages in the rest of the movie. Can our hero find redemption?Ross finds hope in spunky Sandra (Gisele Itie) who ferociously resists dictator General Garza (David Zayas, subdued here) in the South American island nation of Vilena. Of course, there's always an evil American behind all this, and unrepentant ex-CIA officer James Monroe (Eric Roberts) pulls the puppet strings. Even with Paine (Steve Austin) and the Brit (Gary Daniels) amongst his troops, Monroe doesn't have a chance.If you can't guess how this is going to end then you haven't seen many action movies. Suffice it to say that dictators are overthrown, buildings are blown up, and souls are saved. Along the way villains are shot, sliced, stabbed, crushed, and burned alive.  The dialogue is occasionally funny (Yang complaining about how he has to get paid more because he works harder due to his small stature really cracked me up), the violence always intense, and the pace never, ever slows down.

Sure, he had to forego on a few names that should've been in the movie (e.g. Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Kurt Russell, Scott Adkins) and yes, expectations for this picture likely ran so high that it was impossible to satisfy everybody out there, but the fact is that Stallone has managed to make those names he did get to swallow their pride and be sized up alongside eachother. It's a feat in moviemaking that other features only inched towards but which Stallone not only accomplished but made look good. This is, without a doubt, required viewing for all general action fans.The story: an expert team of no-fail mercenaries - Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone,Rocky series), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham,The Transporterseries), Ying Yang (Jet Li,Hero), Toll Road (MMA star Randy Couture), and Hale Caesar (football hero Terry Crews) - is called upon to overthrow the dictator of a small South American island (David Zayas,Dexter)...unaware that their target is backed not only by a corrupt US official (Eric Roberts) but also an unbalanced former teammate of theirs (Dolph Lundgren,Universal Soldier).The movie is notable for many promotional reasons, not the least of which for featuring a true supergroup of legitimate action stars from an array of cinematic disciplines. What appealed to me the most, however, is that it's a return to the ring for several cast members who have been estranged from big budget films for some time. You could argue this for the likes of Stallone, Mickey Rourke, and cameo man Arnold Schwarzenegger, but hey, they've either already made their comeback or continue to enjoy publicity. Eric Roberts has had to slog his way through too many dastardly DTV titles, but since he was inThe Dark Knight, I can't feel too sorry for him. No, the real surprise entries to the cast are the Swedish Superman Dolph Lundgren and B-movie dragon Gary Daniels as one of Munroe's main bodyguards, alongside Steve Austin. Since his last theatrical feature of 15 years ago, Lundgren has become somewhat of a cornerstone of the low-budget action market, supplying hit-or-miss titles alongside Seagal and Van Damme but never really losing his credibility and always looking ready for a comeback. This is only the second film of Daniels' to see a theatrical release, because for some reason, this martial arts wizard has found himself saddled almost exclusively with sub-par scripts and directors; sure,Bloodmoonwas awesome, but it's about time he saw some high-profile action again...and what could be more high-profile than fighting Jet Li and Jason Statham at the same time? Kudos to director Stallone for these picks.Upon hearing of its existence, my hopes for the film's action content were so high that, realistically, they were impossible to meet, but I'd still say that the movie's gunfights, brawls, and chases are easily among the most pleasing I've seen this year. Again, there's a lot to be said for the out-of-the-blue adrenaline pieces (e.g. Statham riding the nose of a plane and absolutely destroying the posse of his girlfriend's abusive ex, Crews wielding a machinegun firing explosive rounds, Stallone and Statham taking out a gang of soldiers with guns and many, many knives), but I found the most appeal in a specific area: the decisive match-ups between the credited cast members. In the past, we've only occasionally been able to enjoy showdowns between two high-profile stars (e.g. Stallone vs. Wesley Snipes,Demolition Man), but more often than not, big names are wary of taking on other big names for fear of appearing inferior. While we do miss out on seeing Stallone taking on either Bruce Willis or Schwarzenegger in anything but a verbal joust, the film does supply us with promising hand-to-hand encounters of Stallone vs. Austin, Austin vs. Couture, Daniels vs. Li & Statham, and Li vs. Lundgren. Not content to give viewers the usual cop-out, director Stallone presents us with real winners and losers...even making himself one of the latter. The Li/Lundgren fight is both my personal favorite of the bunch and a good example of this: though it could've been longer, it's an unbarred martial arts encounter with both performers getting to show off their respective fighting styles - Li as the leaping wushu wizard, Lundgren as the stand-up karate powerhouse - before showing, without a doubt, who the superior warrior is. Fans will be shocked but likely satisfied.The one aspect where the movie really falters, though, is in fleshing out its characters...or rather, fleshing out some characters as much as others. This was probably unavoidable, considering how saturated with big names this one is, but it's still disappointing to see some folks billed decisively above others. Stallone and Statham are presented as the upfront stars of the feature, getting more screentime than anybody else and possessing the most personality. Roberts is almost always presented more impressively than David Zayas, and Steve Austin almost makes Gary Daniels forgettable by comparison. Lundgren is excellent as a crazy villain and therein much more interesting than rival Jet Li, who is still afforded more characterization than Couture and Crews, both of whom can't have more than three scenes apiece in which they're not fighting. It's amazing that, in the midst of all this, the movie still had time to establish Mexican TV star Giselle Itie as an entrant to American cinema...but then again, it managed probably managed so by skimping on the role of Christmas' ex (Charisma Carpenter,Angel).Production values are strong, especially considering the wide scope of the film and the variety of its locales, although the graphics involved when Steven Austin is set on fire looked a bit unconvincing to me. If you're hip to action movies, I needn't comment too much on the acting, which is okay in terms of guys like Zayas, Li, and Statham, pretty good by Stallone, Roberts, and Lundgren, and very satisfying during a couple of Rourke's scenes. While I was disappointed that the film seemed to have been made more in the mindset of general Hollywood-style productions rather than 80s/early-90s B-movie ham, it speaks a universal language in terms of big guns, big guys, and big fights, so even a fan of low-budget fare like me can't complain too much. ""The Expendables"" really is the action opus extravaganza we've been wishing for for all these years; whether or not you enjoy it as an action fan is whether you were careful about what you wished for.",4,"""Bring it, Happy Feet!""",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,6789,"['Ever', 'emergence', 'first', 'modern', 'high-profile', 'action', 'heroes', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'clamoring',

I don't know why, but to simply put it, some of the toughness felt forced. You have all this top calibur celluloid muscle in need of better material. I know the story and dialogue are suppose to be cheesy and cliche, but Sylvester Stallone couldn't even write anything memorable for the much talked about cameos of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. I have to admit that the line Stallone says to Arnold as he's leaving is great and easily the best of the movie. Believe it or not, I think a longer version would make it better. There are too many main characters that we learn little to nothing about. I hope we get an extended DVD release in the future.The cast is all about tearing people to shreds using various tools of death and as far as this genre goes, we have the best of the best on display. Stallone is solid, but Jason Statham is the standout. I also liked Mickey Rourke, who is easily the most natural actor of the bunch. Jet Li had a couple of good lines and fight scenes, while Terry Crews uses the most devasting handheld gun on film since the minigun wielded by Jesse Ventura in Predator and Arnold in Terminator 2. I do have to give credit to Dolph Lundgren, who I thought would be horrible, for turning in the scariest performance in the movie.If I were to pick my favorite pure action movies of the summer, I would have to go with Predators first, closely followed by The Expendables. Overall, it's a good throwback to the 80's, with plenty of gore, violence, and a body count way too extreme to ever try and calculate.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",3,"Magic mirror, on the wall, who is the biggest bada** of all?",1281744000,"08 14, 2010",2010,1751,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'three', 'star', 'review', 'fool', 'Expendables', 'fun', 'acton', 'movie', 'would', 'give', 'half', 'star', 'could', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'deliver', 'as', 'much', 'could', 'have', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'simply', 'put', 'toughness', 'felt', 'forced', 'have', 'top', 'calibur', 'celluloid', 'muscle', 'need', 'better', 'material', 'know', 'story', 'dialogue', 'are', 'suppose', 'be', 'cheesy', 'cliche', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'write', 'anything', 'memorable', 'much', 'talked', 'cameos', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'have', 'admit', 'line', 'Stallone', 'Arnold', 'leaving', 'great', 'easily', 'best', 'movie', 'Believe', 'not', 'think', 'longer', 'version', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'main', 'characters', 'learn', 'little', 'nothing', 'hope', 'get', 'extended', 'DVD', 'release', 'future.The', 'cast', 'tearing', 'people', 'shreds', 'using', 'various', 'tools', 'death', 'as', 'far', 'genre', 'have', 'best', 'best', 'display', 'Stallone', 'solid', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'standout', 'also', 'liked', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'who', 'easily', 'most', 'natural', 'actor', 'bunch', 'Jet', 'Li', 'had', 'couple', 'good', 'lines', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'most', 'devasting', 'handheld', 'gun', 'film', 'minigun', 'wielded', 'Jesse', 'Ventura', 'Predator', 'Arnold', 'Terminator', '2', 'do', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'who', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'horrible', 'turning', 'scariest', 'performance', 'movie.If', 'were', 'pick', 'favorite', 'pure', 'action', 'movies', 'summer', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'Predators', 'first', 'closely', 'followed', 'Expendables', 'Overall', 'good', 'throwback', '80', 'plenty', 'gore', 'violence', 'body', 'count', 'way', 'too', 'extreme', 'ever', 'try', 'calculate.3', '1/2', '5', 'stars']",N/A

1311604,AQ0EO10KTRJ4V,B002ZG999U,"M. Spitzer ""mas017""","[1, 2]","The way Stallone recently brought both ROCKY and RAMBO full circle and ended those iconic film series on a good strong note with a solid note of finality was masterful.5 stars to both ROCKY BALBOA-2007 and JOHN RAMBO-2008But EXPENDABLES ?????Hmmmm ...I know it was supposed to be a sort of not-too-serious homage to the action movies of the 80s, but for some reason it did not HIT me the same way the last ROCKY and RAMBO did.Maybe I have reached a point in life where I can only appreciate a movie if there is some sort of deeper message I can relate to based on my own experiences.Perhaps I don't get excited about fireworks (literally I don't), big explosions, gunfights, fistfights and car chases like I did when I was 16 years old.For whatever reason, when it came to EXPENDABLES I could not help but feel that the reason there was so much hype and buzz about the movie was the very special assembled cast of big names.Looking at the 5 minutes of plot and 101 minutes of POW -- BOOM --- WHAM,  I can't help but feel if this exact movie had been made with any other group of actors it would have been overlooked and dismissed as just another forgettable and generic action movie.This movie does have a magic, but it is because of the assembled cast led by Stallone.With any other random cast of actors, the movie would probably not seem as special.EXPENDABLES has lots of flash and energy, but not the same soul as other Stallone movies of recent years.In all fairness, perhaps it is not intended to be really deep.  Perhaps it is intended to be pure escapism action, action, action.If that is the case, the fault is not with the movie itself, but with my frame of mind or expectations I may have had following ROCKY BALBOA and JOHN RAMBO.(both movies that had action but also a deeper meaningful message one can relate to).Note -- I think the scene with Rocky talking to his son outside the restaurant in RB, is one of the most powerful scenes in all of Stallone's movies.I am a big Stallone fan.I respect the guy personally and professionally.Tons of hard work went into making this film that must be respected.We watch his films like ROCKY BALBOA-2007, JOHN RAMBO-2008, Cliffhanger, Get Carter, Lock Up and others at least once per year each at our house.But in the case of EXPENDABLES, while we have added it to our Blu-Ray collection,  I don't think it will be viewed quite as often in the future as our other favorite Sly films.It may just be my tastes changing as I get older that has effected my feel for this particular film.If I shift my mind into a pure action film mentality (the same mentality I may have had 25 years ago watching Arnold's COMMANDO),  I may end up rating this movie higher...  but mentally I'm not that same young guy anymore either.Yeah .....  I think that is a fair analysis.Lastly,I will confess, I think I may have enjoyed the two Blu-Ray bonus feature documentaries INFERNO (the filming)  and FROM THE ASHES (post production)  as much or more than the movie itself.It is interesting for somebody not actively involved in the film making business to see an extensive behind the scenes look at all the work that goes into making a 90 minute film.Yes, we all know you need a script, screenplay, set design, wardrobe, shoot scenes, music soundtracks, editing, etc...We all know the basic concept of how movies are made..... but as an analogy,  there is a difference between knowing how a car works in theory and being able to build one yourself from scratch.The two bonus feature documentaries on the Expendables Blu-Ray go into good detail on the whole process from beginning to end.As good as the movie itself for me personally.",4,Not as good as the latest RAMBO and ROCKY,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3665,"['way', 'Stallone', 'recently', 'brought', 'ROCKY', 'RAMBO', 'full', 'circle', 'ended', 'iconic', 'film', 'series', 'good', 'strong', 'note', 'solid', 'note', 'finality', 'was', 'masterful.5', 'stars', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA-2007', 'JOHN', 'RAMBO-2008But', 'EXPENDABLES', 'Hmmmm', 'know', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'sort', 'not-too-serious', 'homage', 'action', 'movies', '80s', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'HIT', 'same', 'way', 'last', 'ROCKY', 'RAMBO', 'did.Maybe', 'have', 'reached', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'can', 'only', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'sort', 'deeper', 'message', 'can', 'relate', 'based', 'own', 'experiences.Perhaps', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'excited', 'fireworks', 'literally', 'do', ""n't"", 'big', 'explosions', 'gunfights', 'fistfights', 'car', 'chases', 'did', 'when', 'was', '16', 'years', 'old.For', 'reason', 'when', 'came', 'EXPENDABLES', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'feel', 'reason', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'hype', 'buzz', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'special', 'assembled', 'cast', 'big', 'names.Looking', '5', 'minutes', 'plot', '101', 'minutes', 'POW', 'BOOM', 'WHAM', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'exact', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'other', 'group', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'overlooked', 'dismissed', 'just', 'forgettable', 'generic', 'action', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'have', 'magic', 'assembled', 'cast', 'led', 'Stallone.With', 'other', 'random', 'cast', 'actors', 'movie', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'seem', 'special.EXPENDABLES', 'lots', 'flash', 'energy', 'not', 'same', 'soul', 'other', 'Stallone', 'movies', 'recent', 'years.In', 'fairness', 'perhaps', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'really', 'deep', 'Perhaps', 'intended', 'be', 'pure', 'escapism', 'action', 'action', 'action.If', 'case', 'fault', 'not', 'movie', 'frame', 'mind', 'expectations', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'following', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA', 'JOHN', 'RAMBO', 'movies', 'had', 'action', 'also', 'deeper', 'meaningful', 'message', 'one', 'can', 'relate', '.Note', 'think', 'scene', 'Rocky', 'talking', 'son', 'restaurant', 'RB', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'Stallone', 'movies.I', 'am', 'big', 'Stallone', 'fan.I', 'respect', 'guy', 'personally', 'professionally.Tons', 'hard', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'respected.We', 'watch', 'films', 'ROCKY', 'BALBOA-2007', 'JOHN', 'RAMBO-2008', 'Cliffhanger', 'Get', 'Carter', 'Lock', 'Up', 'others', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'house.But', 'case', 'EXPENDABLES', 'have', 'added', 'Blu-Ray', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'viewed', 'quite', 'as', 'often', 'future', 'other', 'favorite', 'Sly', 'films.It', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'tastes', 'changing', 'get', 'older', 'effected', 'feel', 'particular', 'film.If', 'shift', 'mind', 'pure', 'action', 'film', 'mentality', 'same', 'mentality', 'may', 'have', 'had', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'watching', 'Arnold', 'COMMANDO', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'rating', 'movie', 'higher', 'mentally', ""'m"", 'not', 'same', 'young', 'guy', 'anymore', 'either.Yeah', '..', 'think', 'fair', 'analysis.Lastly', 'will', 'confess', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'two', 'Blu-Ray', 'bonus', 'feature', 'documentaries', 'INFERNO', 'filming', 'THE', 'ASHES', 'post', 'production', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'itself.It', 'interesting', 'somebody', 'not', 'actively', 'involved', 'film', 'making', 'business', 'see', 'extensive', 'scenes', 'look', 'work', 'making', '90', 'minute', 'film.Yes', 'know', 'need', 'script', 'screenplay', 'set', 'design', 'wardrobe', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'music', 'soundtracks', 'editing', 'etc', 'know', 'basic', 'concept', 'how', 'movies', 'are', 'made', '..', 'analogy', 'difference', 'knowing', 'how', 'car', 'theory', 'being', 'able', 'build', 'one', 'scratch.The', 'two', 'bonus', 'feature', 'documentaries', 'Expendables', 'Blu-Ray', 'go', 'good', 'detail', 'whole', 'process', 'beginning', 'end.As', 'good', 'movie', 'personally']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[5, 5]","Those going into The Expendables should know what they're getting beforehand: a knock-down, over the top 80s throwback action blast that represents some of the best qualities of the 80s action flicks that star/director Sylvester Stallone made famous.  Stallone stars as Barney, leader of a team of mercenaries (which also includes Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Dolph Lundgren) that gets way in over their heads when employed to overthrow a South American dictator (Dexter's David Zayas) and the beyond bad crew (Eric Roberts and Steve Austin) pulling the strings behind the scenes.  Story and dialogue take second place to the action sequences, which are wonderfully orchestrated and filmed, yet nowhere near as graphic or gut-churning as what Stallone managed to pump out with 2008s Rambo.  Not to mention the fact that there are more than a few moments where the film takes itself too seriously, which does detract from the overall notion that this is a bona-fide guilty pleasure kind of action movie that boasts the best throwback action cast, well, maybe ever.  Like I said, if the aforementioned cast members aren't enough for you, how about Mickey Rourke, Gary Daniels, and unbilled cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Or ample eye-candy in the form of Giselle Itie and Charisma Carpenter?  There's just so many feel-good aspects about The Expendables that it soon becomes easy to overlook its flaws, and that in itself is nothing less than an achievement.

1311614,A16C1J5AW2CDRE,B002ZG999U,O Shepard,"[1, 2]","I wanted to like this film but unfortunately it does not quite cross into even great A-list movie territory. It is missing a strong storyline and character development. The potential is there but the opportunity was missed in favor of non-stop action instead. Not to belittle the action. It was a pleasure to see real stunt work instead of CGI, and one must give kudos to Stallone for attempting to recreate the old time stunt filled action film of past decades. Just for that alone the movie is well worth seeing. As you watch this film, just think about how dangerous these scenes were to film. Too bad that much of the amazing fight scenes at the end of the film is marred by too many fast cut edits which does not give the viewer nearly enough time to digest the extraordinary difficulty of staging these scenes.A word must also be said about the 3 disk Blu-Ray edition. If you are networked, the Blu-Ray disk makes a connection to the internet. This makes this disk one of the slowest loading Blu-Ray disks I have seen so far. I thought at first that the disk was faulty because there was no on-screen message about what was happening, just a sort of skull icon that if you paid very very very close attention to, indicated that something was being loaded. Secondly, the viewer has to sit through  previews and other commercial messages before getting to the main menu. Skipping them is difficult. No way to avoid this.Third, the standard DVD disk version in the package contains no extras. The featurette available on the regular single DVD edition of the film is not in this set.

To be honest, I liked ""The A-Team"" better, because it had more consistant action set-pieces in it and had a bit more plausible plot line going for it, yeah I said it, plausible plot line...LOL.  Anyway, not talking anything away from ""The Expendables"", but I thought parts of the movie dragged a bit, although the important scene, such as the monologue by Mickey Rourke really hit home, by bringing the over-all feel of the movie to the forefront.That said, Expendables is still an enjoyable action flick.  And because it was done as a homage to action flicks of the '80s, I believe it has a slightly softer focus than a modern film would otherwise have.  I kind of hope they do a sequel, as Rourke's character needs to go on a mission with them.  What I found great about the film though is that there was very few uses of stunt men.  Most of the stunts, fight scenes, etc. were done by the actual actors.  Stallone spent as much time in the hospital as he did shooting the film!  Separated shoulder, torn ligaments...pretty much all courtesty of Steve Austin.Oh, did I mention the guns?  This movie has some of the baddest guns I've ever seen.

Of course the story is cliche and stupid (overthrowing a South American dictator, which has been seen in HOW many movies?), but that's the point- just to be a ridiculous fun action movie with tonnes of violence and humour. As much as I liked Rambo IV, I feel it got a little too carried away in its anti-war message, so I was hoping Sly would give us a bit more of a fun outing this time, and he did not disappoint.Sly, Statham, Li, Crews, Lundgren and more all give great performances in this flick.

The biggest reason why is that there are just too many characters! While Stallone and Statham are clearly ""the stars,"" there are also over a dozen other ""supporting stars"" -- and The Expendables has to give each one of those stars enough screen time to establish his character, to make us like him enough that we care if he lives or dies, and to let him feature in at least one cool scene. That's a HUGE chunk of time spent doing nothing but rolling out characters. It didn't add anything to the plot (mainly because there WAS no plot), while it really cut into the action.And even when there was good action, the director filmed the biggest scenes in the dark, using shaky-cams. So I could tell that someone was shooting, but didn't have a prayer of figuring out who was shooting who. The introductory hostage rescue, and the assault at the end, both suffered from this. My TV has pretty good contrast, but I don't like having to rewind every 60 seconds to figure out what just happened.The remaining action scenes were good, mind you! A solid car chase or two, some nice martial arts action, and even an old-fashioned streetfight on a basketball court -- all the kind of stuff I expected. If the whole film were able to keep that level of over-the-top, cinematic action, it would've been great.(Alternatively, it could've had a good plot, instead of one that made absolutely no sense. ""The villain kidnaps the girl before escaping -- why? Uh... because he's the villain and that's just what they do!"" Heh. But that's secondary at best. No one goes into The Expendables expecting a strong plot -- we want crazy action!

Stallone's direction I thought was acceptable,as was the plot.The story which is as see through as silk stockings,starts with a hostage taking on a ship off of Africa(some might argue Mr Stallone is keeped it direct,but simple).Stallone leads a mercenary team to the rescue and does it with quick dispatch.However team member Gunner played by Lundgren(doing his fave psycho-soldier routine from Universal Soldier)goes a little over the top when he wants to hang one of the pirate hostage takers.He's stopped and is summarily kicked off the team for being untrustworthy.Back home team leader Barney(Stallone) is summoned to a meeting with a Mr.Church(Willis)in a....where else?..church.At the same time he has invited an old rival of Barney's called Trent(Schwarzenegger)to outbid Barney,if he's so inclined,for the job.The job is to go to an imaginary island called Vilena in the Gulf of Mexico to overthrow the dictator there.Trent tells Church to give the job to Barney as he ""likes to play in the jungle""(referencing his Rambo days)and walks out.Church asks Barney what Trent's problem is and he replies""He wants to be President""(referencing his current political life).Barney and a small reconnaissance team suss out the island and barely escape with their lives.It seems the man pulling the dictators strings is an ex CIA agent gone rogue called Munroe.Barney now knows that the real target is Munroe not the dictator.However he had a brief encounter with the dictators daughter on the island who is vehemently opposed to her fathers rule but elected to stay behind when given the chance to leave.He can't get her out of his mind and decides to return to rescue her,without his team.But the team elects to follow their leader and a long and bitter struggle ensues with Stallone killing Munroe and ending the reign of terror on Vilena.This film is not much more than the window dressing that covers it,or a book with a lovely dust jacket with nothing inside,if you will.We have all these well known actors,buffed up,with testosterone oozing everywhere and nothing much at all to do or say;and what they do say and do is predictable and sometimes unappealing.But what,in the end,Stallone brought these guys together to do,he succeeds in tremendously.This group of guys is not here to do Shakespeare or to win Academy Awards.Stallone knows the appeal of the action film genre,as he has been part of it for most of his career,along with all the others on board.No,action and only action,INTENSE action,action BEYOND action,is what is served up in large dollops here.And I think most guys would agree,it went down mighty good.The action is not for the feint of heart,with over the top explosions,kills and lots and lots of blood and gore.Also,think about this aspect of Stallone's train of thought re making this movie in the first place.Not only will the film attract HIS fans,but also those of each and every other action man on board this film.This is a film that could not help but be a win,win at the box office.Mr Stallone is NO dummy folks.The film is about 103 minutes long and comes in its 2:35:1 widescreen format.The transfer has been well done and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very good.Extras include an audio commentary by Stallone,a making-of featurette,deleted scenes,a gag reel & trailers,on the Blu-Ray copy only.The DVD copy has just the trailer as an extra,and there is the digital copy for your computer.In conclusion what should have been a great send up of past action movies with a heavy hitting cast,the likes of which you rarely see,was a little disappointing.However Stallone and company did deliver the INTENSE action they set out to,just not at the level I thought they could and should have.This combo pack is certainly a good buy.3 1/2

1311655,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B002ZG999U,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","The Expendables (Sylvester Stallone, 2010)Ten minutes into The Expendables things had already gotten so unbelievable that I asked myself why I was watching this low-rent-but-all-star take on one of my all-time favorite movies, The Dogs of War. But that very unbelievability made it stupidly entertaining enough that I kept going and discovered the movie's few treasures, though most of it is exactly the kind of mindless, predictable action-comedy that I figured I was getting when I went in.That unbelievable opening scene involves our group of Expendables--Barney Ross (Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and Toll Road (Randy Couture)--rescuing a bunch of hostages from Somalian pirates (led by The Mist's Amin Joseph). The ridiculousness comes from all the bullets flying around and not a single civilian casualty. Amazing how that works! Afterwards, there's a brief scuffle between Yang and the less-ethical Jensen. Jensen departs the group, who are soon after hired by a nameless guy calling himself Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) who wants a Central American dictator, General Garza (Dexter's David Zayas), overthrown, and is willing to offer the job to either Barney's bunch or another band of mercenaries led by Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first screen appearance since 2004, albeit in a cameo). Barney and co. get the job and head off to meet their in-country contact, Sandra (On the Road's Giselle Iti&eacute;), and get to overthrowin'. Problem is, the General is both backed by a guy who may or may not be a CIA operative (The Dark Knight's Eric Roberts) and surrounded by mercenaries himself, ruled by the sadistic Paine (Steve Austin)... and including Jensen, who was with the group long enough to be able to anticipate most of Barney's moves.You will most likely be able to map out the way the entire movie unfolds by the end of the scene with Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzie. Which, as long as you're looking for a brainless action movie, is perfectly okay--but with so many obvious references to the single greatest action movie ever created combined with so many big-huge-massive-name action stars, and I am perfectly willing to admit this may be my problem and not the movie's, I was expecting something more than I got, something like that life-shattering twist where Christopher Walken marches into the new dictator's office as if he's simply going to demand the money he's owed and... does what he does that leaves your jaw sitting on the floor in a drool pool. Or, you know, even a halfway intelligent script that didn't sacrifice brains for one-liners every chance it got. (And this is where those ""few treasures"" come in--all of them involve Tool's Bar, where the gang hangs out during downtime; Tool, played by Mickey Rourke, is kind of the group's Yoda, and he is easily the best thing about the film.) But if you take it for what it is, it fulfills its role adequately. ** ",3,"Ridiculous, but fun anyway.",1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2989,"['Expendables', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', '2010', 'Ten', 'minutes', 'Expendables', 'things', 'had', 'already', 'gotten', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'asked', 'why', 'was', 'watching', 'low-rent-but-all-star', 'take', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'Dogs', 'War', 'very', 'unbelievability', 'made', 'stupidly', 'entertaining', 'kept', 'going', 'discovered', 'movie', 'few', 'treasures', 'most', 'exactly', 'kind', 'mindless', 'predictable', 'action-comedy', 'figured', 'was', 'getting', 'when', 'went', 'in.That', 'unbelievable', 'opening', 'scene', 'group', 'Expendables', 'Barney', 'Ross', 'Stallone', 'Lee', 'Christmas', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'Yin', 'Yang', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Gunnar', 'Jensen', 'Dolph', 'Lundgren', 'Hale', 'Caesar', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'Toll', 'Road', 'Randy', 'Couture', 'rescuing', 'bunch', 'hostages', 'Somalian', 'pirates', 'led', 'Mist', 'Amin', 'Joseph', 'ridiculousness', 'bullets', 'flying', 'around', 'not', 'single', 'civilian', 'casualty', 'Amazing', 'how', 'Afterwards', 'brief', 'scuffle', 'Yang', 'less-ethical', 'Jensen', 'Jensen', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'soon', 'hired', 'nameless', 'guy', 'calling', 'Mr.', 'Church', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'Central', 'American', 'dictator', 'General', 'Garza', 'Dexter', 'David', 'Zayas', 'overthrown', 'willing', 'offer', 'job', 'Barney', 'bunch', 'band', 'mercenaries', 'led', 'Trench', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'first', 'screen', 'appearance', '2004', 'albeit', 'cameo', 'Barney', 'co.', 'get', 'job', 'head', 'meet', 'in-country', 'contact', 'Sandra', 'Road', 'Giselle', 'Iti', 'eacute', 'get', 'overthrowin', 'Problem', 'General', 'backed', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'surrounded', 'mercenaries', 'ruled', 'sadistic', 'Paine', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'including', 'Jensen', 'who', 'was', 'group', 'long', 'enough', 'be', 'able', 'anticipate', 'most', 'Barney', 'moves.You', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'able', 'map', 'out', 'way', 'entire', 'movie', 'unfolds', 'end', 'scene', 'Willis', 'Stallone', 'Schwarzie', 'Which', 'as', 'long', ""'re"", 'looking', 'brainless', 'action', 'movie', 'perfectly', 'okay', 'so', 'many', 'obvious', 'references', 'single', 'greatest', 'action', 'movie', 'ever', 'created', 'combined', 'so', 'many', 'big-huge-massive-name', 'action', 'stars', 'am', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'admit', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'not', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'something', 'more', 'got', 'something', 'life-shattering', 'twist', 'where', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'new', 'dictator', 'office', 'simply', 'going', 'demand', 'money', 'owed', 'what', 'jaw', 'sitting', 'floor', 'drool', 'pool', 'know', 'even', 'halfway', 'intelligent', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'sacrifice', 'brains', 'one-liners', 'chance', 'got', 'where', 'few', 'treasures', 'come', 'involve', 'Tool', 'Bar', 'where', 'gang', 'out', 'downtime', 'Tool', 'played', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'kind', 'group', 'Yoda', 'easily', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'take', 'what', 'role', 'adequately', '**']",N/A

Look deeper, though, and you'll find a surprisingly human story underneath. These men, while physically dominating, are also quite fragile. They are misfits, too scarred by the things they've witnessed to function in normal society. Therefore, they must rely on each other to survive. This is especially apparent in Dolph Lundgren's character, Gunner, a man psychologically fractured by his past and always a hair's breath away from a violent end. Mickey Rourke's character is another prime example; he frequently laments the choices he's made, while relying on the group's bond to keep himself from going to pieces.And yes, there's also quite a bit of gunplay, fisticuffs and gore. Some of the blood looks a little too CG for me, but that's OK.

All of the active Expendables kick serious tail including Jet but he's the butt of numerous short jokes and especially comes off weak in two fights with Dolph Lundgren. In fact, most of the choice hand to hand battles feature Jason Statham and that's great but Sly knew Jet's fans wanted more from him. Jet broke through Hollywood's glass ceiling long ago so it's awkward seeing the killing machine from War, Fearless, The One, Fist Of Legend, Cradle To The Grave and other awesome flicks playing third banana. Other than that, Schwarzenegger and Willis appear in cool cameos, Rourke adds another notch to his comeback belt, Terry Crews gets the ball and runs with it, Randy Couture and Steve Austin give us a bout that neither The WWE or UFC could make happen, and even Gary Daniels gets to flex some Martial Arts muscle. Oh, and Eric Roberts is in it too. So, overall The Expendables is a good time in the tradition of The Dirty Dozen, Force 10 From Navarone, The Delta Force, Commando, and Stallone's Rambo epics with lots of explosions, gunplay, MMA action, and some of the toughest cats in film history. It's definitely worth owning if you're a true action fan.

Any paying patron will pretty much know what to expect from the movie itself, having most likely already seen the previously released theatrical cut. So, the question to be answered is how does this version differ and is it worth the extra dough to add to one's collection.Assembling an impressive cast of veteran tough guys and action stars, Sly Stallone co-wrote, directed and stars alongside Jason Stahtam, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin,  Gary Daniels, Terry Crews, and with cameos from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This is a big, dumb movie of the highest order, who could ask for anything more. Arcing back to the days when action flicks were about brute force, well trained stuntmen and correctly timed charges. None of this nancy boy CGI wire effects that can turn even the meekest of movie stars into a superhero. Don't worry about plot, all we need is just enough dialogue to get us from one gun battle to the next.As it is, I enjoyed the theatrical version when I saw when it was first released a couple of years ago in a throwback to the days of my boyhood when I greatly anticipated each and every new film from these stars. The new extended cut is according to Sly himself in an introduction before the movie ""better than the theatrical, has more content, more heart and is closer to it's original intent."" Okay, I don't know about all that, but what I can tell you is that this version is longer, cooler, more violent and makes better use of music. Still, the rough edges of a rush production are as evident as before.We see, or rather hear the new additions right up front with a giddily corny voice over introduction by Stallone's Barney Ross character that does nothing for the flick. However, we quickly get an extended action scene. There is far more humor to this version, I loved all the talk of Lundgren's Viking beliefs and funerals, and Sly and the Stath are awarded more amiable banter. Couture and Crews, who were short changed in the theatrical release, here get at least a little more screen time,  character development and more full monologues. There are a few additional dramatic moments offered to Statham and love interest Charisma Carpenter, that like dramatic scenes from earlier Stallone directed films comes across awkward with wobbly performances. And yes, more action. The best addition pervaded here is the use of music, from the different opening titles unfolding over Sully Erna (of Godsmack)'s moody ""Sinner's Prayer"" to the successful inclusion of Shinedown's ""Diamond Eyes"", so popular in the movie's trailer, played over the final showdown sequence.A significant improvement, I would actually say. A more fully rounded, fun and entertaining adventure film.

1311709,A19DW3VKM5KKYB,B002ZG999U,TheBandit,"[7, 8]","I was discussing the new Director's Cut of The Expendables with a friend, and found myself using the same word to describe it: interesting.  Not ""better"" or ""improved,"" just... interesting. To an even larger degree than he did with the ""Rambo"" director's cut, Stallone has not just added deleted footage into the movie. He has re-edited a great deal of the movie. It's eleven minutes longer, but that hardly describes the reworking The Expendables has received.I really liked The Expendables theatrical cut and thought it was a fun blast of macho action. The Blu-ray release is loaded with tons of great stuff - including the fantastic feature-length documentary ""Inferno"" - that really deepened my appreciated for the huge effort that Stallone and company invented in this movie. I didn't think it was without flaws though. Possibly the main one was an overall lack of depth to the lead character, Stallone's Barney Ross. I chalked it up to the fact that Stallone was wearing a lot of hats on this one (actor, writer, director) and also working with a relatively low budget (as far as these types of movies go, anyway).I also agreed that with the large number of supporting characters, many of them got somewhat short-changed - especially Jet Li, who is one of the main stars. The main story felt a little clumsily told as well. It seemed like a director's cut was a very good idea. And Stallone says in the introduction, ""I liked the theatrical version, but I love this."" So naturally it only makes sense to compare to two versions.For better or worse, I would say they are the same but different. The same in the sense that nothing has really changed about the way the story is told (and that the story itself isn't very imaginative or original). There's still a ton of characters, most of them receiving only very minor expansions if at all. This includes Jet Li, who still feels underused. It's kind of like if an author wrote a good book, then decided to go through and reword the majority of it without really altering the content of the story. The Director's Cut of ""The Expendables"" is an alternate way of looking at basically the same movie.Some of the violence has actually been toned down, with little trims made here and there to the bloodier scenes. Certain lines of dialogue - such as Jason Statham receiving a text message during a siege on pirates near the beginning - have been cut entirely. Mickey Rourke's great monologue has been subtly trimmed - just enough to change the pacing, which was perfect to begin with. Lee's girlfriend Lacey (Charisma Carpenter) has a much lighter bruise on her face when Lee goes to visit her - which is a puzzling change, considering the injury prompts a very violent retaliation by Lee against her assaulter. During the climatic action sequence, Brian Tyler's effective score has been replaced by a rock song.I'm not wild about any of these changes, but I don't think any of them would have changed my overall high level of enjoyment of the movie if this had been the version I first saw. That's what I mean by ""same but different."" The movie remains very entertaining, and I think I would have been equally satisfied with this version had it been released in theaters. But I don't think it really improves upon the version that was released.A few of the significant changes work really well.  The new opening credits sequence - complete with new music (a rock song, but this time it's a new sequence so we don't lose any of the score) - helps convey the weariness and isolation of the team of mercenaries. Much of the banter between Stallone's Barney Ross and Statham's Lee Christmas is expanded, which helps both characters. And some of the re-edited action scenes - especially the fight between Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li - are more visually dynamic and flow better.Overall it's a mixed bag, at least for me. I don't know which version I will be more likely to rewatch - though I know I'm more used to the theatrical cut.

The Expendables puts together some the best and biggest action movie stars and delivers a classic 1980's testosterone fueled action movie. In fact it's very much as if you had a blank DVD/Blu-Ray and injected testosterone into it. If you're not a fan of action movies, don't bother. But if you are a fan of action movies in general and liked what some of these actors have previously done you're in for a good time my friend. On the other hand if you can't stand the over-machoism, 80s action movies, Sly, over the top action...Well you get it, this won't be for everyone. The Expendables takes us back to a time where heroes were really heroes, cheesy one liners, over the top action sequences...good stuff. There is definitely an audience for this type of film since the movie performed really well at the box office earning over $274 millions on an $82 million budget. The incredible cast is what got most viewers to see this film: Stallone, Li, Statham, Lundgren, Austin, Couture, Rourke, even Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger make appearances!The Expendables follows an elite group of mercenaries sent on a mission to Vilena an island near South America to beat up some bad guys and help the island get rid of their dictator. The storyline is simple but effective, as far as action movies goes this makes sense and it works, Stallone was never really known for his scripts anyway, fans expect him to deliver in the action department. I loved seeing Dolph Lundgren again, Statham was pretty badass, Stallone was great as always, Mikey Rourke was excellent in his role. Only ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin was a bit of a let down, I mean I'm not a huge fan of his but he only had one god scene for the most part he was just standing around and paid to look tough. There's plenty of action and over the top moments to satisfy action fans I would say, don't expect everything to make sense, this is big old dumb action!I realize that The Expendables is not for everybody but if you miss the glory days of action movies like Rambo, Cobra, Die-Hard, Terminator and so on then this is something you want to see. Objectively, I don't think The Expendable deserves a full five star but being a fan of most of these actors and witnessing some of the glory days of action movies once more. If you're merely curious you should check it out as well but you should just know what to expect before. I loved seeing all these action big names together; it was quite an experience to say the least. Besides all the criticism that Stallone usually gets from critics, and the reviewers who didn't find it to their liking The Expendables was a movie that I really enjoyed, I found it to be much better than most action movies that are released today. If you liked the film you may be pleased to know that a sequel is apparently in the works.

Then away went the 80 and the icons washed away.This movie is a hard one to grad ebecause it had some nice little things in it. It lied to me about Arnold - i am going to spoil one thing here so, if you don't want it, turn away from this paragraph. Now, noting Arnold, he just popped in and popped out, complaining he didn't want any part of the mission. When Sly was asked aobut it, he said it was ""because (he) wanted to be president."" While this was funny it also lied a bit, and it watered down a few choices for action stars. In some instances it even felt like some of the stars were 3rd or 4th teir, making me think of just how little of a role they played.Without spoiler: When I watched the Expendables, it reminded me of the difference between Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Begins. One of them is stylized and, when I saw it, i thought it was one of the best things around. When I returned after seeing a more realistic approach in Batman Begins, I noted just how empty some of it felt. The same can be said of Expendables to some extent - it felt like I fell into the 80s, hit my head a little, and woke up with an armada of icons that wer enot what I remembered.Life has been rough on a few of these people - this was a noticeable fact. Mickey and Sly were two that seemed strange to see, clearly making me feel like this was a feelgood flashback with some heavy chop to fuel the ""action icon"" idea. It was a good thing on one level, too, but the level I saw was not a grand level but was one of those things where I really didn't have to think at all. Still, I expected that and to change it up would have been - weird.I guess I can say that a person watching this knows what they are getting. They know that this is a feel good, roll em' out of the nursing home so they can act movie, and that might make some people happy. Expect this and this alone and you also won't feel ripped. If you expect more, however, you mightcry. I say this because you certainly won't get the movie you want, maybe that doesn't exist if you think action of that level, and because you can see it in the ads.

1311721,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002ZG999U,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","""The Expendables"" is a sort of a throwback to the 80s-style action film making. It is about a good macho guy or guys with guns shooting (lots of) bad guys. The good guy has to complete one mission or more in the most disadvantageous circumstances. Those who have grown up with such films as ""Commando"" or ""Die Hard"" (the first one) know what I am trying to say.The difference is, ""The Expendables"" directed by Sylvester Stallone has a lot of ""good"" guys played by our favorite actors including Jason Statham and Jet Li. A mercenary team led by Barney Ross (Stallone) is hired to assassinate a dictator in a South American country, where a local rebel Sandra (Giselle Iti&eacute;) assists them. That's it. There are a few twists in the story, but the storyline itself is simple.The film also features Steve Austin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Gary Daniels, Dolph Lundgren and Eric Roberts. Each fighter (and ex-fighter) has their own signature arsenal or abilities - knife, martial arts, demolition, and so on - and when action starts, they never fail to use them. Not all guys fight. Mickey Rourke appears as an ex-mercenary and tattoo artist delivering a moving speech.

1311722,A9R6Z1PMRJ0BV,B002ZG999U,Twins Daddy,"[1, 5]","First, this was the WORST STORY I've seen in quite awhile. Just AWFUL. There's nothing at all compelling about it. Even the 2008 RAMBO remake had an infinitely more interesting and suspenseful story than The Expendables. It's like it was written by a 6th grader for a book report (yeah, I know Stallone wrote them both). We saw this movie the day after it opened and I counted no less than 6 people in our theater actually SLEEPING at various times before the final 30 minutes, when some action actually happens. There was even snoring 2 seats over from me! That's what a lackluster and forgettable storyline does to people sitting in a dark theater...It becomes VISUAL MELATONIN. It's really a shame too with such a great cast. Everyone brought their A-game to The Expendables, but they could only perform within the limits of the lame story.For example, a 20 min (+/-) ""recon"" trip to the Latin American island by Stallone & Statham? Really, now...PURE FILLER! The ONLY reason this was even in the story was because they ""had"" to meet the General's daughter and expand their ""cause"". And that's 20 minutes that woulda, coulda, shoulda been spent having gunfights and blowing crap up! Instead, you have to wait until they're actually leaving the island to get any kind of explosive action. So then they go home, regroup and return to the same freakin island to finish the job they woulda, coulda, shoulda just done on the initial trip. And once they began their assault on the island, there was at least 5 minutes of film devoted solely to the various Expendables characters simply running around setting explosive charges to some over-the-top Hollywoodesque heroic musical score! Seriously...They just continuously ran around setting charge after charge. It was like you had filmed your kids for 5 minutes just running around the neighborhood in their new Halloween costumes. After the first 15 or 20 sec it was comedic, although I'm sure it was never INTENDED to be...I was also duped into thinking Bruce Willis and The Governator were actually INVOLVED in the movie. Well, it was just HYPE. They have a brief meeting in a church and it's over. Stallone might as well have met with Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick Star in the church. So with that disappointment and the lame story continually failing to ignite any passion in the audience as well as the actors, The Expendables forever lost any chance to live up to the pre-release hype and actually be a 5-star movie.There are only TWO things that saved this movie from a 1 or 2-star rating: 1) The final 30 minutes that had the action that the rest of the movie was lacking and 2) the AA-12 automatic shotgun used by Terry Crews' character, ""Hale Caesar"". The fistfights, gunfights and explosions that happen in the final 30 minutes when the real assault takes place is what woulda, coulda, shoulda been taking place during the rest of the movie instead of what seemed like endless, BORING dialogue between Stallone & Statham...Stallone & Rourke...Statham & his love interest...Stallone & Statham & the General's daughter......UGGGHHHH!!! Just over and over and over the plot DIED into pool after pool of merciless drivel.Would I see The Expendables again? Well, I wouldn't PAY to see it again. As I said, the actors were all very good...Stallone and Lundgren were even exceptional. But Stallone has done enough movies that when he sat through a pre-release screening of this one, I wouldn't be surprised if he just stopped the film after 20 or 30 minutes and said, ""C'mon guys...I thought we were making an ACTION FILM here!"" Yeah, that's what I thought too. I really like all of these guys and saw them on the NYSE floor on CNBC a few days after the release just having a great time. And that FUN was what the terrible story here prevented from happening until the final 30 minutes. In fact, if you just walked into the theater after watching another movie and saw the final 30 minutes of The Expendables you'd think, ""WOW! That must've been the BEST MOVIE of the summer!"" On the other hand, if you go in at the beginning then you're likely to doze off a few times or even get up early and leave to go watch the ending of another movie in the same theater complex.And that's what really sucks about The Expendables...It only delivers a partial dose of what woulda, coulda, shoulda been with a cast like this. This isn't rocket science. You've assembled a top team of testosterone-filled bodies. Get the opening credits out of the way, then give them big guns, lots of ammo and blow everything up in sight right until the final credits roll. Instead, we got a boring story and sporadic action until the movie was about 2/3 over. Assuming there's an Expendables 2, I hope they really do it up right next time...This was their ""mulligan"".",3,"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda Been So Much Mo Better",1282348800,"08 21,

The movie has some solid moments, and the characters are very believable. Yet where is the main plot? Well i'm still asking myself this. Eric Roberts(usually known for his horrible performances)really does a great job as an American drug lord who goes in to liberate a small country somewhere close to Mexico. The only thing you really know is The Expendables get recruited by Bruce Willis who has a short but decent cameo with Stallone and the Legendary goveranator Arnold S. Basically they are sent there to take out this general but find out there is a little(very little) more to it when they rally the troops and find out they are extremely out numbered, but never fear they will find there way. The female informant on the island won't leave, mainly because its her home and she feels that its not necessary and that things will change. Well not leaving gets her totured, and also you find out she is the evil general's daughter, which isn't a spoiler OR much of a big suprise. Mickey Rourke plays a broken down veteran from the gang known as Tool, who tattoos up Stallone in the beginning and has a few other small appearances here and there, Rourke definitely being the best actor of the bunch does very well for the small part he's given. The rest of the guys just run through the motions and really play a very small part from an actors perspective but later on really get into the action. The fight sequences are planned out well enough, though, some of the editing will give you a seizure because the footage moves so fast from scene to scene you really can't tell who's beating up who, which is the way a lot of action films are directed these days.Well in summing up The Expendables all i can say is if your a hardcore old school fan of blowing things up without much of a story(much like Rambo) then this movie is definitely for you. Even though i think they are trying to break a record for number of explosions to occur in a film, for the oscars(ha), it should appeal to those who like this type of movie. I was very pleased to see such older veteran actors together even if it was for a short time. I would however like to see Arnold and Stallone take on a roll together, which i hear is a possibility in the near future, though what movie? No one yet knows. Arnold works out religiously everyday which is a great thing considering he's just behind Stallone at 63 years old. Statham and Jet Li should also really really get together, since there fighting styles are much the same and they steal much of the psychical action in the film. So lets hope for that as well. The rest of the characters including Dolph the dope Lundgren(who i must say is horrible in this movie) should just be happy i suppose that they were given a chance to be in a film to show off there skills. So all in all its a decent film that will appease to old school 80's action film fans, but leave the younger crowd saying, who's dad is that? I myself enjoyed most of it, but i could stand a little more substance from a plot perspective next time. Expendables 2? Come on its Stallone what do you think? :)Btw, i don't use names or tell a whole lot in detail as to not give away much of the movie.

I never saw this film in the theatres and its probably better for it because the digital image on high definition DVD lets you see every action sequence crystal clear rather than blurred images.  With director of photography Jeffrey Kimball, Stallone has created the perfect testosterone experience by gathering the greatest action stars of the decade and putting them through seperate vignettes culminating into a climactic ballet of blood making the viewer panting for more.  And out of all this wonderful, blistering action, Stallone pulls off the greatest acting coup for Mickey Rourke as he slows the film down allowing Rourke to do a passionate three minute soliloquy on saving a life which not only shows Rourke's brilliance as an actor but Stallone's maturity as director and mentor to his actors.  With giving each action star except for second billed Jason Statham equal measure throughout its running time and a relentlessly evil performance by Eric Roberts, Stallone has delivered the best action film of this or any other year.

Get your checklist ready, this has it all: a way-cool chase scene, a bring-it-down-around-their-ears ending, badguy foot soldiers who die like flies, a guy who hits girls getting the tar whupped out of him, some wildly improbable but really big gun, and a big man-to-man mano-a-mano fight scene between the two boss badazzes. Throw in the noble loneliness of the tough-but-honest mercenary (close cousin to the prostitute with a heart of gold), a saveable babe, and lots of things exploding as soon as they catch fire - well, youd didn't come here for plausibility. This stands as yet another towering tribute to Utter Manliness and to those select few who sacrifice themselves on its altar, and have a blast doing it. Not that they'd actually ever confess to something as unmanly as having big fun with big-boy toys.A month from now, even the finest memory will have trouble distinguishing this from others of its genre.
