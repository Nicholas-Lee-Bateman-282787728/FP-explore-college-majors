876834,A3BRSTTSIVF4ZM,B00075146C,"Buyer Bob ""Online Buyer""","[4, 6]","Low budget Canadian version of a Hobo-like Rin Tin Tin.  Acting is cheesy and very low budget. The Actor talks to the dog throughout the episodes, but the dog doesn't answer. Interesting to see the lineup of newbie actors who eventually made it in the states.  A good purchase, especially for Family Night TV.  What sucks about Volume 1 and 2, as far as collecting the series, is that they not only DON'T list the NAMES of the episodes in the Amazon description, or on the box, or on the DVD's. You select Play at the start of the DVD, and roll right into episodes with no Titles. The first box states you get 12 episodes, the description of the second box won't say.  Where are the Episodes individual titles?  Why the con?  Because there were 8 seasons of this show on TV. 1963-1965 in Black and White, with Randy Sparks singing the more popular theme song ""Stop Over-(on the Road without end)"", and 1979-1985 in color with Terry Bush singing the theme song ""Maybe Tomorrow"". The seller of this DVD collection does not want you to know which episodes you are getting, or have bought in case they release some other compilation of episodes, in a different box, so you will buy them too, and later discover you already have some of the episodes. To NOT list the episodes in the Amazon description is crooked. You don't know what you got, until you watch, and you STILL don't know the title after seeing the episode. If the seller is reading this, list the episodes in the Amazon Description, on the box, AND on the DVD. By the way, the famous Randy Sparks version song to the intro of the 1963-1965 episodes is dubbed by someone else. Sounds wimpy.

876841,A2LE3L67OYS7ZW,B00075146C,toserveman,"[34, 35]","I remember seeing this show as a child in the mid 1960s, but hadn't seen it since.  It was great to get this DVD and revisit a fond childhood memory.  The show doesn't have the panache of a CSI, or the action of 24, and is about as far from trendy as you'll get.  But it has a quiet mesmerizing charm about it.  When I started to play this DVD, my wife and son and I sat through over 2 episodes without hardly moving a muscle.  And my son isn't usually interested in anything from the past.  So this show obviously has something.  It was produced with a lot of thoughtfulness, and the stories are interesting.  It was produced in Canada starting in 1963, and I beleive it ran for three seasons.  The first three episodes on this DVD are in color, even though they were presented in black & white when initially shown on TV.  The rest of the episodes are black and white.  To me, it looks better in black and white.  Anyway, the DVD transfers look excellent, and the episodes appear to be complete.  The color portions are a little washed out in places, but not bad.  I'm sure they did the best with what they had to work with.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD.  It would be great to watch with the whole family.",5,Interesting Show - DVD Release Very Well Done,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,1216,"['remember', 'seeing', 'show', 'child', 'mid', '1960s', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'was', 'great', 'get', 'DVD', 'revisit', 'fond', 'childhood', 'memory', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'panache', 'CSI', 'action', '24', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'trendy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'quiet', 'mesmerizing', 'charm', 'When', 'started', 'play', 'DVD', 'wife', 'son', 'sat', '2', 'episodes', 'hardly', 'moving', 'muscle', 'son', ""n't"", 'usually', 'interested', 'anything', 'past', 'show', 'obviously', 'something', 'was', 'produced', 'lot', 'thoughtfulness', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'was', 'produced', 'Canada', 'starting', '1963', 'beleive', 'ran', 'three', 'seasons', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'are', 'color', 'even', 'were', 'presented', 'black', 'white', 'when', 'initially', 'shown', 'TV', 'rest', 'episodes', 'are', 'black', 'white', 'better', 'black', 'white', 'Anyway', 'DVD', 'transfers', 'look', 'excellent', 'episodes', 'appear', 'be', 'complete', 'color', 'portions', 'are', 'little', 'washed', 'out', 'places', 'not', 'bad', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'Overall', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'watch', 'whole', 'family']",The Littlest Hobo TV Series: Collection Vol. 1
