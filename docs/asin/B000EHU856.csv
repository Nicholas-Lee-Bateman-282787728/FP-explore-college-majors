The image quality is clean and sharp even for a regular dvd version.The bad news is that, Blood Brothers truly sucks! The story and its pacing is slow and boring. There are too many awkward, silent moments even when its not in the context of the movie or character Interactions.There are many scenes where characters are walking through long open fields, as the camera follows one end to the other (when they  could have easily EDITED  those scenes).The fights are few and far apart, with lots of slow moving hand to hand combat.

Jaworski ""jawsomatic""","[11, 13]","Before you purchase this movie and expect to see ""The Five Venoms"" type kung fu or post-1975 Lau Kar-Leung choreography, let me just say it isn't that.  Shaw Brothers films in the early 1970s, even the ones directed by the maestro, Chang Cheh & choreographed by Lau sifu, were still getting to that level.  Chang re-invented HK action cinema only five to seven years earlier.  With that said, I still really like this movie.  Along with ""The Pirate"", ""The Savage Five"" & ""Deadly Duo"" this is one of the best early Ti Lung/David Chiang pictures.  It even co-stars Chen Kuan-Tai.  What makes this even more significant (at least to me) is that the story is based on an actual historical scandal that the Ching government attempted to cover up.This is my take on this picture; first, the movie-Great storytelling, despite being nearly two hours I was never bored, creative visuals and an ending that hits ya right here, know what I mean?  Second, the choreography-OK, OK it doesn't compare to Lau sifu's post-1975 work (when he started directing) or the Venoms, but it's good for it's time.  It's sturdy, good old-school fu that paved the way, that opening fight between Ti Lung & Chen Kuan-Tai is exciting, yo!  Third, the DVD presentation-Dragon Dynasty did a fantastic job with the remastering; correct ShawScope ratio, your choice of English or Mandarin, remastered subtitles (not dubtitles like ""Hard-Boiled"") and decent box cover art.  No special features, but what are ya gonna do?  I don't expect everyone to agree with me, different people think differently, but if you are a Shaw and/or Chang Cheh fan, I think you can't go wrong here.

973900,APIW11UEPKIC2,B000EHU856,"morgoth ""we lamas are traditional enemies of ...","[3, 4]","I got this movie for Ti Lung, Chen Kuan Tai, and David Chiang.  Wow, was I surprised at what I got.  Ti Lung is probably the best kung fu ""actor"" maybe ever and David Chiang proves to be close behind him in this film.  In a setting somewhat similar to the movie Hero, David Chiang plays a prisoner who explains why he assassinated a general of the Qing army.  What unfolds is a very captivating story of 2 bandits (Kuan Tai and Chiang) and an officer of the Qing army who meet by chance on the road and become friends.  The kung fu is pretty good but watching Chen Kuan Tai when he was first coming up is spectacular.  I have never seen him look better while he is  jumping around, doing kicks, and displaying some of the fiercest fighting I have seen from him.  With a woman involved and an unusually GREAT story from Cheng Cheh and of course Ni Kuang, this is as good as a war ""epic""  you are going to get from the Shaw Brothers studios.  And with it being directed by Cheh, we certainly get a heroic ending.  Hard to explain, it is the same as his other movies, but when the Cheng Cheh ending comes around this time, it was much deeper than any Venom's film.Don't buy this movie expecting one of the fastest paced, greatest mind blowing kung fu movies ever, it is just a great movie.",5,great movie,1154649600,"08 4, 2006",2006,1286,"['got', 'movie', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'David', 'Chiang', 'Wow', 'was', 'surprised', 'what', 'got', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'probably', 'best', 'kung', 'fu', 'actor', 'maybe', 'ever', 'David', 'Chiang', 'be', 'close', 'film', 'setting', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'movie', 'Hero', 'David', 'Chiang', 'prisoner', 'who', 'why', 'assassinated', 'general', 'Qing', 'army', 'What', 'very', 'captivating', 'story', '2', 'bandits', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'Chiang', 'officer', 'Qing', 'army', 'who', 'chance', 'road', 'become', 'friends', 'kung', 'fu', 'pretty', 'good', 'watching', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'coming', 'up', 'spectacular', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'look', 'better', 'jumping', 'around', 'doing', 'kicks', 'displaying', 'fiercest', 'fighting', 'have', 'seen', 'woman', 'involved', 'unusually', 'GREAT', 'story', 'Cheng', 'Cheh', 'course', 'Ni', 'Kuang', 'as', 'good', 'war', 'epic', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'studios', 'being', 'directed', 'Cheh', 'certainly', 'get', 'heroic', 'ending', 'Hard', 'explain', 'same', 'other', 'movies', 'when', 'Cheng', 'Cheh', 'ending', 'time', 'was', 'much', 'deeper', 'Venom', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'movie', 'expecting', 'one', 'fastest', 'paced', 'greatest', 'mind', 'blowing', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'ever', 'just', 'great', 'movie']",The Blood Brothers (Shaw Brothers)
973901,A38RF06HMSYVLO,B000EHU856,"P. A. Clark ""P.A. Clark""","[4, 4]","Blood Brothers was a decent Shaw film for plot and storyline, but it wasn't a hard hitter in the martial arts department.The film is actually based on a well documented incident during the Ching Dynasty. In it Chang Wen (David Chiang) and Huang Chung (Chen Kuan Tai) are friends who work as bandits.  Huang also happens to be married to Mi Lan, an attractive girl, but she's too conservative for Huang's tastes.  As a result, he tends to spend most of his time with other women who prefer his  wild approach to life.  Mi Lan is aware of his cheating however and it creates a greater divide between them as the movie progresses.Eventually Ma Hsin (Ti Lung)happens down the road where the two men are waiting to rob him. While Huang and Chang attempt to fight him on the road, Mi Lan sneaks up on the scene and rides off with his silver on her horse.  Chang and Huang also retreat confident that they got away with their robbery without a hitch.  Soon afterward though Ma Hsin tracks them down.  To their surprise he doesn't t try to fight them again.  Instead he convinces Huang and Chang to join him in an effort to do more with their lives, somehting their ancestors could be proud of. The three of them band together as blood brothers and take out the local bandit leader.  Then they take charge of the bandit cheifs men.  Soon they start the process of training the group in Kung Fu while they also teach them to become more respectable in society.As time goes by however,the divide between Huang and Mi Lan grows. She feels discarded by him as he chases around other women.  However her and Ma Hsin begin to become attracted to one another.  Realizing that the new love triangle could ruin there Blood Brother status, Ma Hsin decides to leave.  Chang seems to be aware of the situation though, while Haung is oblivious to the whole idea that his wife has fallen for a Ma Hsin. He doesn't pay attention to her enough to notice.Five years pass by and Ma Hsin becomes a respected general in the army.  He's assinged the task of taking out the local rebel bands scattered around the country. He realizes that he needs help though so he calls on his Blood Brothers to join him.  Together the three of them win several battles over the rebels and their reputations rise greatly, particuarly Ma Hsin's.  Ma Hsin and Mi Lan are still attrated to one another though and eventually they act on it.  Meanwhile Chang realizes what's going on between them and is torn about what to do.  His best friend's wife is now cheating on him with his other blood brother. Ma Hsin must also worry about the growing gossip which could effect his reputation as a general. Betrayal, anger and fights follow as the blood brothers try to sort through their differences.  The film sorts itself out in the end, I won't spoil it for you.Well Blood Brothers had a very strong plot and storyline to it. I found the whole love triangle theme with a third person on the side lines viewing it from his point of view interesting.While the film has a decent storyline and big name kung fu stars, it fails to have great kung fu action.  We do get to see several fights though both with and without weapons, but the film was definately focusing more on the plot.  So hard core kung fu fans may be disappointed by this one.The tech aspects include the film in Mandrian with eng subtitles and an English dubbed track.  The picture quality is good and the film is presented in widescreen. No other features appear except for a trailer of another film.Overall I gave the film four stars.  It had a good storyline to it and held together well, likely because it was based on a ture story.  The acting is good, and I actually liked David Chiang in the film the best.  The Kung Fu could have been stronger, but there was enough to carry the film through to the end and at least they wern't just mindless brawls every ten minutes.  A good rental if you like Shaw Bros films with a strong plot, or an ok film if you don't mind lower level choreographed fights.",4,Blood Brothers But Not Loyal Brothers!,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,4015,"['Blood', 'Brothers', 'was', 'decent', 'Shaw', 'film', 'plot', 'storyline', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'hitter', 'martial', 'arts', 'department.The', 'film', 'actually', 'based', 'well', 'documented', 'incident', 'Ching', 'Dynasty', 'Chang', 'Wen', 'David', 'Chiang', 'Huang', 'Chung', 'Chen', 'Kuan', 'Tai', 'are', 'friends', 'who', 'work', 'bandits', 'Huang', 'also', 'be', 'married', 'Mi', 'Lan', 'attractive', 'girl', 'too', 'conservative', 'Huang', 'tastes', 'result', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'other', 'women', 'who', 'prefer', 'wild', 'approach', 'life', 'Mi', 'Lan', 'aware', 'cheating', 'however', 'greater', 'divide', 'movie', 'progresses.Eventually', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'Ti', 'Lung', 'down', 'road', 'where', 'two', 'men', 'are', 'waiting', 'rob', 'Huang', 'Chang', 'attempt', 'fight', 'road', 'Mi', 'Lan', 'up', 'scene', 'off', 'silver', 'horse', 'Chang', 'Huang', 'also', 'retreat', 'confident', 'got', 'away', 'robbery', 'hitch', 'Soon', 'afterward', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'down', 'surprise', ""n't"", 't', 'try', 'fight', 'again', 'Instead', 'Huang', 'Chang', 'join', 'effort', 'do', 'more', 'lives', 'somehting', 'ancestors', 'could', 'be', 'proud', 'three', 'band', 'together', 'blood', 'brothers', 'take', 'out', 'local', 'bandit', 'leader', 'Then', 'take', 'charge', 'bandit', 'cheifs', 'men', 'Soon', 'start', 'process', 'training', 'group', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'also', 'teach', 'become', 'more', 'respectable', 'society.As', 'time', 'however', 'divide', 'Huang', 'Mi', 'Lan', 'discarded', 'other', 'women', 'However', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'begin', 'become', 'attracted', 'one', 'Realizing', 'new', 'love', 'triangle', 'could', 'ruin', 'there', 'Blood', 'Brother', 'status', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'leave', 'Chang', 'be', 'aware', 'situation', 'Haung', 'oblivious', 'whole', 'idea', 'wife', 'fallen', 'Ma', 'Hsin', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'enough', 'notice.Five', 'years', 'pass', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'respected', 'general', 'army', 'assinged', 'task', 'taking', 'out', 'local', 'rebel', 'bands', 'scattered', 'country', 'help', 'so', 'Blood', 'Brothers', 'join', 'Together', 'three', 'win', 'several', 'battles', 'rebels', 'reputations', 'rise', 'greatly', 'particuarly', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'Mi', 'Lan', 'are', 'still', 'attrated', 'one', 'though', 'eventually', 'act', 'Meanwhile', 'Chang', 'what', 'going', 'torn', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'friend', 'wife', 'now', 'cheating', 'other', 'blood', 'brother', 'Ma', 'Hsin', 'must', 'also', 'worry', 'growing', 'gossip', 'could', 'effect', 'reputation', 'general', 'Betrayal', 'anger', 'fights', 'follow', 'blood', 'brothers', 'try', 'sort', 'differences', 'film', 'out', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'you.Well', 'Blood', 'Brothers', 'had', 'very', 'strong', 'plot', 'storyline', 'found', 'whole', 'love', 'triangle', 'theme', 'third', 'person', 'side', 'lines', 'viewing', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'decent', 'storyline', 'big', 'name', 'kung', 'fu', 'stars', 'have', 'great', 'kung', 'fu', 'action', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'several', 'fights', 'weapons', 'film', 'was', 'definately', 'focusing', 'more', 'plot', 'So', 'hard', 'core', 'kung', 'fu', 'fans', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'one.The', 'tech', 'aspects', 'include', 'film', 'Mandrian', 'eng', 'subtitles', 'English', 'dubbed', 'track', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'film', 'presented', 'widescreen', 'other', 'features', 'appear', 'trailer', 'film.Overall', 'gave', 'film', 'four', 'stars', 'had', 'good', 'storyline', 'held', 'together', 'well', 'likely', 'was', 'based', 'ture', 'story', 'acting', 'good', 'actually', 'liked', 'David', 'Chiang', 'film', 'best', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stronger', 'was', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'end', 'least', 'wer', ""n't"", 'just', 'mindless', 'brawls', 'ten', 'minutes', 'good', 'rental', 'like', 'Shaw', 'Bros', 'films', 'strong', 'plot', 'ok', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'lower', 'level', 'choreographed', 'fights']",The Blood Brothers (Shaw Brothers)
