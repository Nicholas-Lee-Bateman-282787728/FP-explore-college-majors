Although the focus is the historic lodges in the national parks, it also brings the history and drama, if any, of both the lodges and the parks. This series helps me understand what it looks like or feels like long before the modern ages. It's a bridge connecting now and then, and you will appreciate the efforts by so many people not only make it happen, but also make it stand until today.Technically, most of these national park lodges follow the style called Parkitecture (park architecture). They are most inspired by European (Swiss) chalets or local Indians in a rustic and blending (with the surrounding nature) way. The philosophy behind the design of the lodges is not to compete with the nature, but keep in a low profile so that people can see the best of the nature. While these lodges may look old today, they are almost the first class at that time. Most of these lodges are not designed to last for such long years. Modernization (restoration and rehabilitation), strengthening the structure but keeping the appearance the same, have been done for most of them and that's why they are still operating today. Almost all of these lodges are listed in National Historic Landmark or National Register of Historic Places. So they are as treasure as the national parks.These lodges are mostly built by railroad companies, which is vital to the early development in the national parks. ""Since we can't export the scenery, we'll have to import the tourists"" as the famous quote from William Cornelius Van Horne, President of Canadian Pacific Railway, these lodges give tourists comfort while exploring the parks, which helps the success of the national park idea as they are not widely supported at that time. To know this better, Ken Burns-Dayton Duncan's ""The National Park"" will reveal more details.I try to stay in these lodges at least one night when I tour national parks and I've stayed in more than 10 lodges of this kind. I won't say they are most comfortable to stay, but it's fun to experience what people have experienced 100 years before. Most of them are affordable, though not the cheapest, for mid class while others are rather expensive. If necessary, I do camping to balance the budget for this, which helps me know the park even better. I recommend Old Faithful Inn of Yellowstone, Many Glacier Hotel of Glacier and Grand Canyon Lodge of Grand Canyon (North Rim) to try for your own experience, if you can make the reservation. Even you can't stay one night there, you can still go into the lobby and surrounding areas for a look. In fact, it is usually a good idea to spend some time there because they are usually located in a very scenic spot.I bought these DVD's separately couple years before. The combo of the three DVD's is really a bargain as it cost more than $30 when I bought them. If you love Canadian Rockies such as Banff and Jesper, there is another Canadian Rockies lodges DVD for that. Watching these DVD's is a must for people who regard national parks as their destination of life.",5,The way it was......still is!,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,3107,"['forget', 'how', 'watch', 'DVD', 'beginning', 'fall', 'love', 'focus', 'historic', 'lodges', 'national', 'parks', 'also', 'history', 'drama', 'lodges', 'parks', 'series', 'understand', 'what', 'feels', 'long', 'modern', 'ages', 'bridge', 'connecting', 'now', 'then', 'will', 'appreciate', 'efforts', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'make', 'happen', 'also', 'make', 'stand', 'today.Technically', 'most', 'national', 'park', 'lodges', 'follow', 'style', 'called', 'Parkitecture', 'park', 'architecture', 'are', 'most', 'inspired', 'European', 'Swiss', 'chalets', 'local', 'Indians', 'rustic', 'blending', 'surrounding', 'nature', 'way', 'philosophy', 'design', 'lodges', 'not', 'compete', 'nature', 'keep', 'low', 'profile', 'so', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'best', 'nature', 'lodges', 'may', 'look', 'old', 'today', 'are', 'almost', 'first', 'class', 'time', 'Most', 'lodges', 'are', 'not', 'designed', 'last', 'such', 'long', 'years', 'Modernization', 'restoration', 'rehabilitation', 'strengthening', 'structure', 'keeping', 'appearance', 'same', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'most', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'operating', 'today', 'Almost', 'lodges', 'are', 'listed', 'National', 'Historic', 'Landmark', 'National', 'Register', 'Historic', 'Places', 'are', 'as', 'treasure', 'national', 'parks.These', 'lodges', 'are', 'mostly', 'built', 'railroad', 'companies', 'vital', 'early', 'development', 'national', 'parks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'export', 'scenery', ""'ll"", 'have', 'import', 'tourists', 'famous', 'quote', 'William', 'Cornelius', 'Van', 'Horne', 'President', 'Canadian', 'Pacific', 'Railway', 'lodges', 'give', 'tourists', 'comfort', 'exploring', 'parks', 'success', 'national', 'park', 'idea', 'are', 'not', 'widely', 'supported', 'time', 'know', 'better', 'Ken', 'Burns-Dayton', 'Duncan', 'National', 'Park', 'will', 'reveal', 'more', 'details.I', 'try', 'stay', 'lodges', 'least', 'one', 'night', 'when', 'tour', 'national', 'parks', ""'ve"", 'stayed', 'more', '10', 'lodges', 'kind', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'are', 'most', 'comfortable', 'stay', 'fun', 'experience', 'what', 'people', 'have', 'experienced', '100', 'years', 'before', 'Most', 'are', 'affordable', 'not', 'cheapest', 'mid', 'class', 'others', 'are', 'rather', 'expensive', 'necessary', 'do', 'camping', 'balance', 'budget', 'know', 'park', 'even', 'better', 'recommend', 'Old', 'Faithful', 'Inn', 'Yellowstone', 'Many', 'Glacier', 'Hotel', 'Glacier', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'Lodge', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'North', 'Rim', 'try', 'own', 'experience', 'can', 'make', 'reservation', 'Even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'one', 'night', 'there', 'can', 'still', 'go', 'lobby', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'look', 'fact', 'usually', 'good', 'idea', 'spend', 'time', 'there', 'are', 'usually', 'located', 'very', 'scenic', 'spot.I', 'bought', 'DVD', 'separately', 'couple', 'years', 'combo', 'three', 'DVD', 'really', 'bargain', 'cost', 'more', '30', 'when', 'bought', 'love', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'such', 'Banff', 'Jesper', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'DVD', 'Watching', 'DVD', 'must', 'people', 'who', 'regard', 'national', 'parks', 'destination', 'life']",N/A

1268327,A1KAUV9QYLP52J,B002GWDK70,Kellyannl,"[18, 18]","This volume collects all of the outstanding Great Lodges of the National Parks specials run on PBS - both the original series and it's shorter sequel.  Although it's great for armchair travelers, if you're toying with the idea of getting some of the parks under your belt and part of your vision of your visit to the National Parks includes their architecture, then I particularly entreat you to watch this collection before making your initial vacation plans.The set is basically what it claims to be - a look at the best lodges and hotels in and around the National Parks of the United States.  Mostly, that means accomodations in the Rustic National Park style, affectionately nicknamed ""Parkitecture"" - a style which combines elements of American hunting lodges and European chalets.  With the exception of Yosemite's Ahwahnee and Death Valley's Furnace Inn, which will be cases of window-shopping for most of us, these lodgings should be financially possible for most viewers in the Middle Class if they save up for them responsibly - although transportation expenses for Alaska and Hawaii might make those years a little tight.Each episode shows you around a set of accomodations and gives you an overall view of the properties, pointing out interesting architectural details you might want to be aware of before your stay.  The stories of each lodgings' construction are told, along with any significant subsequent events like fire or avalanche damage, as well as mention of past and present personalities important to the creation and maintainance of the lodgings.Also of note is that each section also has spectacular, if brief, footage of the parks themselves, giving you a sense of which might be a good fit for you.  Might you prefer tall granite mountains framed by pines and beautiful turquoise lakes, or incredible multicolored sandstone formations?  Since this series gives you a taste of many of the major parks, it acts as a great starting point to orient yourself if you don't really know much about the parks without being too overwhelming.  I emphasize that initial orientation are the operative words - it won't tell you , for instance, that Bryce Canyon is a no-go for anyone with heart or lung problems due to altitude.  The primary focus remains architecture.A must for any National Park DVD collection.",5,A great overview,1266624000,"02 20, 2010",2010,2328,"['volume', 'outstanding', 'Great', 'Lodges', 'National', 'Parks', 'specials', 'run', 'PBS', 'original', 'series', 'shorter', 'sequel', 'great', 'armchair', 'travelers', ""'re"", 'toying', 'idea', 'getting', 'parks', 'belt', 'part', 'vision', 'visit', 'National', 'Parks', 'architecture', 'then', 'particularly', 'entreat', 'watch', 'collection', 'making', 'initial', 'vacation', 'plans.The', 'set', 'basically', 'what', 'be', 'look', 'best', 'lodges', 'hotels', 'National', 'Parks', 'United', 'States', 'Mostly', 'accomodations', 'Rustic', 'National', 'Park', 'style', 'affectionately', 'nicknamed', 'Parkitecture', 'style', 'elements', 'American', 'hunting', 'lodges', 'European', 'chalets', 'exception', 'Yosemite', 'Ahwahnee', 'Death', 'Valley', 'Furnace', 'Inn', 'will', 'be', 'cases', 'window-shopping', 'most', 'lodgings', 'should', 'be', 'financially', 'possible', 'most', 'viewers', 'Middle', 'Class', 'save', 'up', 'responsibly', 'transportation', 'expenses', 'Alaska', 'Hawaii', 'might', 'make', 'years', 'little', 'tight.Each', 'episode', 'set', 'accomodations', 'overall', 'view', 'properties', 'pointing', 'out', 'interesting', 'architectural', 'details', 'might', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'stay', 'stories', 'lodgings', 'construction', 'are', 'told', 'significant', 'subsequent', 'events', 'fire', 'avalanche', 'damage', 'as', 'well', 'mention', 'past', 'present', 'personalities', 'important', 'creation', 'maintainance', 'lodgings.Also', 'note', 'section', 'also', 'spectacular', 'brief', 'footage', 'parks', 'giving', 'sense', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'fit', 'Might', 'prefer', 'tall', 'granite', 'mountains', 'framed', 'pines', 'beautiful', 'turquoise', 'lakes', 'incredible', 'multicolored', 'sandstone', 'formations', 'series', 'taste', 'many', 'major', 'parks', 'great', 'starting', 'point', 'orient', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'parks', 'being', 'too', 'overwhelming', 'emphasize', 'initial', 'orientation', 'are', 'operative', 'words', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'instance', 'Bryce', 'Canyon', 'no-go', 'anyone', 'heart', 'lung', 'problems', 'due', 'altitude', 'primary', 'focus', 'architecture.A', 'must', 'National', 'Park', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A
