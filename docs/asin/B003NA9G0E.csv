1354659,A1YCV76MUFESR1,B003NA9G0E,Anne-Marie G,"[2, 2]","I'm torn between this drama andMischievous Kissas my favorite K-drama to date. Both have the bonus of me being able to select any episode to watch and finding a favorite moment.  I LOVE Jang Geun-Seok as 'Hyung-nim' to appropriate Mi-nam's name for him.  He's wonderfully moody and logical all at once. He seriously knows how to work his guyliner and his facial expressions say more than paragraphs of dialogue.  He is exactly what the lead singer of a guy band should be like, charismatic with an air of mystery.(As a long standing fan of state-side shows likeJem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete SeriesandThe Partridge Family - The Complete First SeasonI have a soft spot for shows that make use of music to tell their story, and I am perfectly comfortable with a slightly unrealistic premise--as long as they stick to the ground rules of whatever premise they've set up, it works)The plot is simple, Go Mi-Nam is set to debut as a second lead singer with the hit group A.N.JELL except he had a botched plastic surgery procedure and is unable to make his initial appearance.  Luckily for him and his manager he has a twin, a female twin who looks just like him (Twelfth NightAnyone? Or for a more contemporary option,She's the Man (Widescreen Edition)--except in this case Mi-Nyu is doing it for her brother, not herself) She is a timid pre-nun (novice possibly?) who hasn't left the protective bubble of the convent, but since she is introduced as often making mistakes in her little world a la Maria inThe Sound of Music - 45th Anniversary EditionIt is no surprise that she ends up being successful (as a whole) in the outside world.The other members of the band are wary of Mi Nam (Nyu in disguise) and Tae Kyung (JGS) is openly challenging and hostile (though he is that way with most people).  Her sweet nature easily wins over the other members of the band and even though Tae Kyung finds out very early on that she is a female, he still does his darndest not to fall for her sweet charms. (Hah! Guyliner won't protect you from what must happen!)This show isn't all fluff, it has its moments where not only the two romantic leads take the audience on an emotional trip, but other characters as well.  The supporting cast is fantastic and perfectly cast (if you don't have a little crush on Lee Hong Ki as Jeremy by the end...how can you resist someone who has named their Golden Retriever Angelina Jolie?)The 'fake' music is ridiculously catchy, you might as well download/buy the soundtrack for it at the same time as you buy the DVDs, just thinking about it gets songs stuck in my head--and I don't know Korean.This is a tv show well worth anyone's time.",5,Pretty Hard Not to Fall in Love with This Show,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,2680,"[""'m"", 'torn', 'drama', 'andMischievous', 'Kissas', 'favorite', 'K-drama', 'date', 'have', 'bonus', 'being', 'able', 'select', 'episode', 'watch', 'finding', 'favorite', 'moment', 'LOVE', 'Jang', 'Geun-Seok', ""'Hyung-nim"", 'appropriate', 'Mi-nam', 'name', 'wonderfully', 'moody', 'logical', 'once', 'seriously', 'how', 'work', 'guyliner', 'facial', 'expressions', 'say', 'more', 'paragraphs', 'dialogue', 'exactly', 'what', 'lead', 'singer', 'guy', 'band', 'should', 'be', 'charismatic', 'air', 'mystery', 'long', 'standing', 'fan', 'state-side', 'shows', 'likeJem', 'Holograms', 'Truly', 'Outrageous', 'Complete', 'SeriesandThe', 'Partridge', 'Family', 'Complete', 'First', 'SeasonI', 'have', 'soft', 'spot', 'shows', 'make', 'use', 'music', 'tell', 'story', 'am', 'perfectly', 'comfortable', 'slightly', 'unrealistic', 'premise', 'as', 'long', 'stick', 'ground', 'rules', 'premise', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'plot', 'simple', 'Go', 'Mi-Nam', 'set', 'debut', 'second', 'lead', 'singer', 'hit', 'group', 'A.N.JELL', 'had', 'botched', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'procedure', 'unable', 'make', 'initial', 'appearance', 'Luckily', 'manager', 'twin', 'female', 'twin', 'who', 'just', 'Twelfth', 'NightAnyone', 'Or', 'more', 'contemporary', 'option', 'Man', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'case', 'Mi-Nyu', 'doing', 'brother', 'not', 'timid', 'pre-nun', 'novice', 'possibly', 'who', ""n't"", 'left', 'protective', 'bubble', 'convent', 'introduced', 'often', 'making', 'mistakes', 'little', 'world', 'la', 'Maria', 'inThe', 'Sound', 'Music', '45th', 'Anniversary', 'EditionIt', 'surprise', 'up', 'being', 'successful', 'whole', 'outside', 'world.The', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'are', 'wary', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'Nyu', 'disguise', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'JGS', 'openly', 'challenging', 'hostile', 'way', 'most', 'people', 'sweet', 'nature', 'easily', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'even', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'out', 'very', 'early', 'female', 'still', 'darndest', 'not', 'fall', 'sweet', 'charms', 'Hah', 'Guyliner', 'wo', ""n't"", 'protect', 'what', 'must', 'happen', 'show', ""n't"", 'fluff', 'moments', 'where', 'not', 'only', 'two', 'romantic', 'leads', 'take', 'audience', 'emotional', 'trip', 'other', 'characters', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'little', 'crush', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Ki', 'Jeremy', 'end', 'how', 'can', 'resist', 'someone', 'who', 'named', 'Golden', 'Retriever', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', ""'fake"", 'music', 'ridiculously', 'catchy', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'download/buy', 'soundtrack', 'same', 'time', 'buy', 'DVDs', 'just', 'thinking', 'songs', 'stuck', 'head', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Korean.This', 'tv', 'show', 'well', 'anyone', 'time']",You're Beautiful

It will having you laughing out loud one episode and will break your heart the next. The best gauge of a series is one that makes you feel along with the characters - You're Beautiful will take you on an emotional roller coaster!Go Mi Nyu has decided to become a nun but before she can take her vows she is convinced to cover for her twin brother for awhile. Her twin brother is on the verge of sign on to a record label but some botched plastic surgery prevents him from obtaining his dream. Go Mi Nyu disguise herself as him and takes his place, unbeknownst to the other band members. If dressing up as a boy and try to deal with super stardom isn't enough, the other band members are a challenge the has Go Mi all twisted up. Along the way Go Mi realizes that her brother did not want to join the band just to become famous, but to also find the parents that abandon them at birth. Ultimately, Go Mi must struggle with hard trues, the brutality of stardom, and new found feelings of love - once all the band members start falling for her (even before the know she is a girl)!!!One of the best things about this drama is the catchy music. I find myself humming it to myself in the shower occasionally.

After all of the hype and emails I got about how great this series is I finally decided to buy it. Luckily for me, it was on sale so I didn't feel as bad. Anyway, no synopsis here as you can read those elsewhere. The main problem for me is the female lead doesn't look anything like a male and would never be mistaken for one. Also, the storyline isn't all that great as I had to force myself to finish the series. This is only my opinion but, for a show about music, it wasn't all that great. Before I bought it, I told a friend about this series and how great it's supposed to be. I let her borrow it and she told me it's one of the worse series she's ever seen. If you're thinking about buying this set, look for it online first and watch a couple of episodes, what I should have done, to see if you'll like it. If you want to watch some good K-dramas, at least in my opinion, try some of these: 18 vs 29, A Prince's First Love, IRIS, All In, Flowers For My Life, Be Strong Geum Soon, Prosecutor Princess, Sweet Spy, Love Story in Harvard, Boys Over Flowers, Attic Cat, The Grand Chef, Bad Couple, General Hospital 2, Dae Jang Geum and Next. 18 vs 29 and IRIS are two of my faves while Flowers For My Life is funny yet very sad at the same time and will definately bring tears to your eyes. I haven't finish Next yet, as of this review, but from the first three episodes it's pretty interesting to say the least.

To put it shortly, the story is about a young nun in training who takes on the roll of her m.i.a. brother posing as a new member of a boy band.While the premise is pretty fluffy, there are additional elements that flesh out the storyline to give it depth.  You will find yourself rooting for Chin Woo's unreturned love of Go Mi Nam...(enough people liked this couple- which they later filmed Heartstrings (another must see).) Its fun to find how the guys compete to win her favor.  The OST is pretty good, I have a couple of the singles.

Living at the church for so many years, she has little awareness of what's happening in the world outside.Her twin brother, Go Mi Nam, is about to sign on with a popular band in Korea called, A.N.Jell. The band is composed of three heartthrobs, Jeremy, Shin Woo, and leader Tae Kyung. Jeremy is playful and silly. Shin Woo is thoughtful and protective. And leader Tae Kyung is snobbish and persnickety. Unfortunately, Go Mi Nam is stuck in the U.S. recovering from surgery, which puts him out of commission for a short time. The bands manager tracks down his sister in hopes of her pretending to be Mi Nam until he returns. However, the other band members and everyone else are not allowed to know. Mi Neyo reluctantly agrees.Mi Neyo believed her calling was to be a nun, but as she gets to know the guys and explores the world around her she starts to feel differently about her life. Especially when she falls in love with Tae Kyung.The main actress, Park Shin Hye, is so funny! There were lot's of laugh-out-loud moments. The drama is not only humorous, but heartwarming, fun, and sweet. There are also plenty of interesting love triangles too.All the main actors are great. This show actually brought the main characters a lot of popularity. The three main guys are not only actors, but are singers too. Jang Geun Suk (Tae Kyung) is a solo singer, Jung Yong Hwa (Shin Woo) is from the band ""C.N. Blue,"" and Lee Hong Ki (Jeremy) is from the group ""F.T. iland."" And speaking of singers, the music in the drama is great too and sung by the actors themselves. All the songs are fun, memorable, and full of emotion.""You're Beautiful"" is 16 episodes. If you like this show, I also recommend watching and listening to the soundtrack of ""Heartstrings."" The main actress, Park Shin Hye and actor, Jung Yong Hwa, from ""You're Beautiful"" are the main characters in the romantic comedy, ""Heartstrings."" The rest of C.N. Blue is also in ""Heartstrings.""",5,"Love the Show, Love the Music, Love the Characters!",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",2013,2003,"['Innocent', 'kind', 'orphan', 'Go', 'Mi', 'Neyo', 'nun', 'in-training', 'Living', 'church', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'little', 'awareness', 'what', 'happening', 'world', 'outside.Her', 'twin', 'brother', 'Go', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'sign', 'popular', 'band', 'Korea', 'called', 'A.N.Jell', 'band', 'composed', 'three', 'heartthrobs', 'Jeremy', 'Shin', 'Woo', 'leader', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'Jeremy', 'playful', 'silly', 'Shin', 'Woo', 'thoughtful', 'protective', 'leader', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'snobbish', 'persnickety', 'Unfortunately', 'Go', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'stuck', 'U.S.', 'recovering', 'surgery', 'commission', 'short', 'time', 'bands', 'manager', 'tracks', 'down', 'sister', 'hopes', 'pretending', 'be', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'However', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'everyone', 'else', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'Mi', 'Neyo', 'reluctantly', 'Neyo', 'believed', 'calling', 'was', 'be', 'nun', 'know', 'guys', 'world', 'feel', 'differently', 'life', 'Especially', 'when', 'love', 'Tae', 'Kyung.The', 'main', 'actress', 'Park', 'Shin', 'Hye', 'so', 'funny', 'were', 'lot', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'drama', 'not', 'only', 'humorous', 'heartwarming', 'fun', 'sweet', 'are', 'also', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'love', 'triangles', 'too.All', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'show', 'actually', 'brought', 'main', 'characters', 'lot', 'popularity', 'three', 'main', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'actors', 'are', 'singers', 'too', 'Jang', 'Geun', 'Suk', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'solo', 'singer', 'Jung', 'Yong', 'Hwa', 'Shin', 'Woo', 'band', 'C.N', 'Blue', 'Lee', 'Hong', 'Ki', 'Jeremy', 'group', 'F.T', 'iland', 'speaking', 'singers', 'music', 'drama', 'great', 'too', 'sung', 'actors', 'songs', 'are', 'fun', 'memorable', 'full', 'emotion', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', '16', 'episodes', 'like', 'show', 'also', 'recommend', 'watching', 'listening', 'soundtrack', 'Heartstrings', 'main', 'actress', 'Park', 'Shin', 'Hye', 'actor', 'Jung', 'Yong', 'Hwa', ""'re"", 'Beautiful', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Heartstrings', 'rest', 'C.N', 'Blue', 'also', 'Heartstrings']",You're Beautiful
1354677,A209J4NK7GR9S3,B003NA9G0E,Lovely D.M.,"[2, 2]","This is an addicting Korean drama and I'm glad that I discovered it. I would have rated this higher if the hero was nicer.The premise is a little ridiculous, but the heroine Gemma could not actually pull off taking the place of her twin brother in the boy band without a lot of help, so that made the storyline more believable. Two of the band members find out about her almost instantly. The third band member who is too clueless is the only one who doesn't find out until later in the series. So Gemma masquerading as Go Mi Nam, gets a lot of help from the leader of the band who finds himself helping her all the time even though he doesn't want to. And the other band member who helps her quietly without telling her that he actually knows that she is a girl.I actually found myself liking Shin Woo more than the hero at some parts. But Tae Kyung (the hero), was also always there for the heroine and helped her a lot. The problem is that he was too verbally harsh with her, and I didn't feel that he really fought for her until the end when he finally went after her.The heroine is sweet and lovable, but at some points I wanted her to fight back. The hero is a mean bad boy who always ends up doing the right thing and taking care of Go Mi Nam, he's also O.C.D .Shin Woo the secondary hero is charming and the strong silent type, and I really liked him too.Overall I enjoyed this series. Even when the hero would be mean, and even when the storyline faltered at some points, this series is still very good and succeeds in hooking the viewer until the end.",4,Great Mix of Comedy Angst and Romance,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,1561,"['addicting', 'Korean', 'drama', ""'m"", 'glad', 'discovered', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'higher', 'hero', 'was', 'nicer.The', 'premise', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'heroine', 'Gemma', 'could', 'not', 'actually', 'pull', 'off', 'taking', 'place', 'twin', 'brother', 'boy', 'band', 'lot', 'help', 'made', 'storyline', 'more', 'believable', 'Two', 'band', 'members', 'find', 'out', 'almost', 'instantly', 'third', 'band', 'member', 'who', 'too', 'clueless', 'only', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'later', 'series', 'So', 'Gemma', 'masquerading', 'Go', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'lot', 'help', 'leader', 'band', 'who', 'helping', 'time', 'even', ""n't"", 'want', 'other', 'band', 'member', 'who', 'quietly', 'telling', 'actually', 'girl.I', 'actually', 'found', 'liking', 'Shin', 'Woo', 'more', 'hero', 'parts', 'Tae', 'Kyung', 'hero', 'was', 'also', 'always', 'there', 'heroine', 'helped', 'lot', 'problem', 'was', 'too', 'verbally', 'harsh', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'really', 'fought', 'end', 'when', 'finally', 'went', 'her.The', 'heroine', 'sweet', 'lovable', 'points', 'wanted', 'fight', 'back', 'hero', 'mean', 'bad', 'boy', 'who', 'always', 'up', 'doing', 'right', 'thing', 'taking', 'care', 'Go', 'Mi', 'Nam', 'also', 'O.C.D', '.Shin', 'Woo', 'secondary', 'hero', 'charming', 'strong', 'silent', 'type', 'really', 'liked', 'too.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'Even', 'when', 'hero', 'would', 'be', 'mean', 'even', 'when', 'storyline', 'faltered', 'points', 'series', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'hooking', 'viewer', 'end']",You're Beautiful
