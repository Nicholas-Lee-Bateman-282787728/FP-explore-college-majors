I had been looing for a sleek set of cordless headphones all the ones I saw until now were too bulky. I have always had good luck with Motorola products before.  The price on Amazon was a lot better then anywhere else.  Walmart had these but they were $80.00 there.  Only $54.00 on amazon which is a great deal along with free shipping.
