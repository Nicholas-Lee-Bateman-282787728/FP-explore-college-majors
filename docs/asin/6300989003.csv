241678,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300989003,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 11]","My best friend is obsessed with this movie.  He thinks it's the funniest comedy ever made and he is always telling me that I NEED to see this because I will love it.  Needless to say, my expectations were extremely high when I settled in to see this.Wow, was I disappointed.Basic premise here is that an uptight workaholic struggling to get home for the holidays finds himself strapped to the back of an obnoxious oaf who happens to downright ruin his every plan and makes a giant dent in his heavily structured life.  From the taxi to the plane to the train to the house, Neal's trip home is altered drastically by Del.  Del is needy and chatty and boorish and kind of gross.  Neal is stubborn and irritable and a tad selfish.They make a perfect couple.The problem with `Planes, Trains and Automobiles' is that it is either too obvious in its attempts at humor or too reserved.  The fact remains that they set this up to be an uproarious comedy of opposites destroying each other's lives (the obvious part) but they don't push the envelope near as much as they needed to in order to make this really work.  The believability is tainted by the overt differences in the two people (when Del comments to God about how he finally found someone who's company he enjoys I was rolling my eyes at the stupidity of that particular comment since there is NO WAY that either of them enjoys a fraction of their time together) and so the ending `ah-ha' moment on the subway feels forced and kind of pathetic.  On top of that though, the humor is really hit or miss.  A lot of viewers obviously love this, and they make comments about the jokes not overstaying their welcome, but I think that is mainly because the majority of the jokes don't hit like intended.This is very dated.I noted to my wife that this film is funnier in snapshots that in running time.  I mean, there are images presented here that really crack me up, but as a whole those sequences don't illicit that lasting laughs you want them to.The chemistry between Candy and Martin (two extraordinary comedians) saves this movie in many spots, but even they are not at the top of their games.

241681,A1IKOYZVFHO1XP,6300989003,andy8047,"[0, 0]","Steve Martin and the late John Candy team up for this hilarious comedy PLANES,TRAINS and AUTOMOBILES. There's a cameo by Kevin Bacon who grabs a cab in the heavy New York City traffic. Bacon starred in SHE'S HAVING A BABY filmed around the same time as this film. Neal Page(Martin) is a marketing executive who plans to return home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. Neal grabs a cab,throwing out Del Griffith(Candy) who was about to enter the cab. Salesman Griffith and Page meet in an airport about to fly to Chicago. Massive storms forced the Chicago flight to be canceled so the two end up in Wichita,Kansas. Page and Griffith check in at the Braidwood Inn. They both take out their credit cards to pay,thus their respective cards accidentally end up in the other's wallet! Page and Griffith share a room since it was the only available room left. They sleep together,thus Page becomes annoyed by Griffith's loud snoring. Page became so angry that he impulsively got up and prepared to get dressed and leave. The pair end up in a heated argument over Griffith's behavior and imcompetence. Page's anger subsides so he undresses again and goes back to bed. Come daylight,Griffith is dreaming that he's embracing his late wife. He gently kisses Page's ear and Page is holding Griffith's hand. So Neal and Del make their plans on how to get home safely and quickly. One point in the film shows an angry Neal upset with an agent at a rent-a-car company(""YOU CAN GET ME A F---ING DATSUN,A F---ING TOYOTA,A F---ING BUICK,A F---ING MUSTANG! FOUR F---ING WHEELS AND A SEAT!"") What happens next? Del shows up in a car he's renting. Incompetent Del finishes smoking a cigarette that when he was about to toss the still-burning butt out the window,it accidentally ended up in the back seat of the car. The car becomes ablaze and even worse,Neal's wallet was in the glove compartment with his credit card back in it. All the glove compartment contents burned in the fire. Now Neal is really furious with Del. Neither had $42.50 to check in for the night at a nearby motel so Neal comes up with $17 cash and a wrist watch. The on-duty manager accepts Neal's alternate payment. When Del comes up with $2 cash and a nicer-looking watch,the manager refuses and ""says goodnight"". Del is freezing to death outside in his charred rent-a-car until Neal invites him to share his room. Come Thanksgiving Day,despite all the aggravation and struggling,Neal arrives home in Chicago safe and sound. Del is with him. Del confessed that he is homeless and lost his wife. That was why Del said in one scene,""I haven't been home in years."" His business of selling shower curtain rings is what is keeping him financially stable and clean. The end theme is ""Everytime You Go Away"" written by Daryl Hall of the rock/pop duo Hall and Oates and was a minor hit for them and later a bigger hit for Paul Young. This film was directed by John Hughes who also directed SHE'S HAVING A BABY and would later direct CURLY SUE. Listen for an audio excerpt from SHE'S HAVING A BABY. It's an argument between Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern.

The writing is sharp and witty, the laughs are nonstop, and the action is absolutely superb, especially the late, great John Candy.Steve Martin is Neal Page, an ad exec on a business trip who wants to fly back to Chicago so he can spend Thanksgiving with his family. Unfortunately, things that go as planned. First, he can't catch a cab. And to make matters worse, his 6:00 flight has been cancelled. While waiting for a later flight, he meets Del Griffith, an overweight blabbermouth who smokes cigarettes and sells shower curtains for a living. It seems that Neil can't escape Dell. First, he sits next to him on the plane, during which he chews his ear off before falling asleep. Soon, the plane lands in Wichita because of a snow storm in Chicago. Neil and Dell share a room together, which is disasterous. They wind up travelling across the country by car, bus and train. The laughs keep coming, and Candy steals the show.I highly recommend this film if you love to laugh.

Anyways, this is another classic Hughes tale. It's a great holiday film to be watched every year. Steve Martin stars as a businessman who is trying to get out of New York City to get home in time for Thanksgiving. On his trip home, he meets up with an annoying schlub, played by the very missed John Candy. Needless to say, the trip back home goes horribly wrong and it's these two guys who keep getting hooked back up with each other. Steve can't seem to get rid of him!. At first, Candy's character seems to be obnoxious. As the trip goes on, we see that there's more to him, and that he's just a normal human being like the rest of us. Martin gives one dandy of a comedic performance here. His uptight businessman is pure perfection. His obscenity laced rant at the car rental desk in the airport is a priceless gut buster. A gem. Same goes to Candy. Is there anybody else who can play a sweet, loveable oaf like him?. No, there is not. Like every other John Hughes film, the ending is nice and warm.

Neil Page (Martin) is an upper class kind of business man in advertising who just can't seem to shake Del Griffith (Candy), a ham-and-egg shower curtain ring saleman just trying to make a living.  Del does the best he knows how, but of course nothing seems to go just right.  After all the laughs, the last few minutes of the film is actually touching.The movie has become a Thanksgiving weekend tradition for us to watch (mute the scene at the Marathon Car Rental desk if the kids are within earshot, otherwise it's hilarious) and I still laugh everytime I watch it.  Both Steve Martin and John Candy deserve more credit for this funny, funny movie.  John Hughes also placed some soundtracks behind the scenes that were great.  I miss John Candy and I only wish he didn't leave us so soon.",4,Need a few laughs?

More importantly, he dissected stereotypes and got to the heart of human interaction. In Planes, Trains, & Automobiles, he creates yet another story of an odd couple brought together by fate and circumstance. It's essentially a fun road trip story with touches of John Hughes-style heart that balances out to be a memorable minor classic. The main issue with the movie is its pretty extreme tonal shifts between slapstick comedy and deep and introspective monologuing. Hughes has handled these tone changes with more grace in the past (The Breakfast Club) and some of the more touching moments are awkwardly sandwiched between scenes of road trip mayhem. Perhaps this is nitpicking, as the film is still a pleasant success, almost wholly due to the great pairing of Steve Martin and John Candy. They're both such lovable actors and they pull off the odd-couple schtick better than almost anyone.

See it.The movie is more or less perfect.  Tiresome complications that wreck most comedies are avoided here by a minimalist cast of two and an almost non-plot:  wealthy man from Chicago who commutes to New York wants to get home in time for Thanksgiving weekend, but along the way he picks up a shower curtain ring salesman who attaches to him like a mollusk to a rock.  Fast start, followed by sequence upon sequence of ever increasing levels of disaster and hilarity.  Even the lulls have forward motion that advances either character or the next futile attempt to reach Chicago.  No longuers.  No overly long monologues from characters trying to EXPLAIN themselves, which make the Hughes teen comedies a little embarrassing to watch.  This is screenwriting at its most stringent.Martin and Candy are two sides of the same coin:  Both are in ""sales and marketing"".  Despite the surface difference between glossy magazine layouts and shower curtain rings, the men essentially have the same job, and have to travel to do it.  One side is insular, deeply competitive and at odds with a hostile world that must be ""got through"" in order to get home; the other side is gregarious and taking in the world with open arms with hardly a thought of getting back home.  Their very difference is what makes them similar to one another.  The result is a buddy picture that's funnier than almost all the rest, and yet more personal because we've got to know each man's internal contradictions so well.

Something about it that you can't put your finger on makes it stay with you.That in itself is probably an amazing feat because, when you really think about it, the plot can be boiled down to a very simple premise. That is a man trying to get home for Thanksgiving.Steve Martin plays Neal Page, an uptight ad exec working in New York. It's Thanksgiving and Neal wants to get to Chicago to be with his family. Along the way he meets a loveable but seemingly annoying traveling shower ring curtain salesman, Del Griffith played by John Candy.The movie could be described as a comedy of errors or possibly a road trip film. Everything that goes wrong does, usually to Neal and because of Del, from delayed planes to cars catching on fire. Initially, Neal tries his best to rid himself of Del, who he considers an annoying bother. However, over the movie, the two begin to bond and become good friends ultimately ending with Del's sad revelation of the truth he's kept hidden from Neal and the audience the whole time.The movie does have a lot of heart to it and I think this is one thing that makes it so memorable. And then there's the ending. I think one of my favorite movie endings ever is how this one ends. In the context of John Candy's sad passing just a few years later, I find it to be even more sad and heartwarming at the same time.Off the top of my head, I feel certain I would rank this as one of John Hughes' top three best movies.",5,The Kind Of Movie That Should Be A Holiday Tradition,1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,1548,"['Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'kind', 'movie', 'once', 'see', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'Something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'stay', 'you.That', 'probably', 'amazing', 'feat', 'when', 'really', 'think', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'boiled', 'down', 'very', 'simple', 'premise', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'Thanksgiving.Steve', 'Martin', 'Neal', 'Page', 'uptight', 'ad', 'exec', 'working', 'New', 'York', 'Thanksgiving', 'Neal', 'get', 'Chicago', 'be', 'family', 'way', 'loveable', 'seemingly', 'annoying', 'traveling', 'shower', 'ring', 'curtain', 'salesman', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'played', 'John', 'Candy.The', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'comedy', 'errors', 'possibly', 'road', 'trip', 'film', 'Everything', 'wrong', 'usually', 'Neal', 'Del', 'delayed', 'planes', 'cars', 'catching', 'fire', 'Initially', 'Neal', 'best', 'rid', 'Del', 'who', 'annoying', 'bother', 'However', 'movie', 'two', 'begin', 'bond', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'Del', 'sad', 'revelation', 'truth', 'kept', 'hidden', 'Neal', 'audience', 'whole', 'time.The', 'movie', 'have', 'lot', 'heart', 'think', 'one', 'thing', 'so', 'memorable', 'then', 'ending', 'think', 'one', 'favorite', 'movie', 'endings', 'ever', 'how', 'one', 'context', 'John', 'Candy', 'sad', 'passing', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'sad', 'heartwarming', 'same', 'top', 'head', 'feel', 'certain', 'would', 'rank', 'one', 'John', 'Hughes', 'top', 'three', 'best', 'movies']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

From his days on ""SCTV"" to his film work Candy could elicit laughs just from his presence and inner warmth even in the lamest of vehicles.  Candy had a prolific film career, that's not to say a consistent one (""Who's Harry Crumb?"",""Nothing But Trouble"").  His constant film work might have been his way for portending his early demise.  Among the dross Candy made a number of good films.  I'm still waiting for my personal favorite, ""Only the Lonely"" with Maureen O'Hara playing his mother get a DVD issue.  Fortunately for us, ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" is also one of his better films.  The film concerns two disparate individuals, buttoned-down family man Neil Page(Steve Martin) and shower-ring salesman Del Griffith trying to get home for Thanksgiving.  Through a series of coincidences or just Del attaching himself to Neil they end up traveling and boarding together throughout their sojourn.  There are any number of hilarious scenes(""Those aren't pillows!"").  My personal favorite has to be one where the pair, bereft of cash, attempt to barter with a motel clerk for a room.  Neil presents a valuable Swiss watch as colatteral.  Del in turn brandishes a Casio.  Alas, this is also a John Hughes film.  Despite alot of inspired comic anarchy that preceded it, Hughes injects a Norman Rockwell sentimental moment at the end.

Join Steve Martin and John Candy in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" to find out. Neal Page (Martin) is in a business meeting in New York two days before Thanksgiving. His trip to Chicago is straightforward. Catch the 6:00 PM plane to O'Hare and arrive in time to be home by nine o'clock. Except that it doesn't work out that way. First of all, he meets Del Griffith (Candy) in the airport and recognizes him as the same fellow who stepped in front of him into the cab he hailed in Manhattan. Del profusely apologizes and begins treating Neal like an old friend. Next, his flight to Chicago is delayed and then diverted to Wichita, of all places, because a snowstorm has closed down O'Hare.The fun is just beginning, as Neal and Del have every misadventure possible trying to get to Chicago in time for Thanksgiving. The locomotive on the train they take from Wichita becomes disabled. They are diverted to a bus, which goes only as far as Saint Louis, leaving them to find alternative transportation the rest of the way to Chicago. (The bus trip itself is riotously funny, and reminds me a bit of the only time I took a long-distance trip on a bus.) Then there's the totally hilarious attempt to drive a rental car from St. Louis to Chicago, which includes a rather scary scene of traveling northbound in the southbound lanes of I-55, and which ends in an accident with two semis going the other way.

For me personally,  I continue to be surprised at how much I laugh when I see this movie. I thought that by now, surely the comic sight gags and the casting of Steve Martin and the late John Candy would automatically make this a candidate for a 1987 time capsule. Instead, I have to agree with Ebert and say this film has only grown over time, The laughs are still there, but so is a somewhat more dramatic undercurrent that I likely ignored the first time I saw it. Directed and written by John Hughes previously known for his teen angst comedies like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink"", it's really a classic anti-buddy picture as two mismatched individuals are thrown together and of course, suffer one bizarre misadventure after another as they try to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving.Although you would think it would have more in common with Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"", the plot actually reminds me much more of Simon's ""The Out-of-Towners"", and anyone familiar with that film will have a good idea of what will happen to them. They spend a night in a cramped hotel room sleeping in the same bed, endure customer-indifferent rental car clerks, suffer through a series of vehicle breakdowns, and watch one of their last hopes literally go up in smoke. As persnickety salesman Neal Page, Martin seems to be on a constant simmer just ready to boil at the most inopportune times. Candy plays the obnoxious Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman armed with an endless supply of dumb jokes and pointless anecdotes. That both manage to make their respective characters likeable is a testament to their appeal as comic actors. Martin is able to elicit empathy for a man uncomfortable with unpredictable circumstances. Candy goes beyond the obvious buffoon to reveal a vulnerable, lonely man made even more so by the holiday season. There is a particularly touching moment when he silently expresses his character's swelling hurt as Neal berates him for his unfunny stories. But it's really the comedy scenes that make this movie truly memorable, the best one involving Del's lip-synching of Ray Charles' ""The Mess Around"" behind the wheel of car he is driving in the wrong direction. The ending is somewhat mawkish, but it doesn't ruin a comedy that deserves to be seen again and enjoyed.

However, I don't recall laughing as hard in a theatre when Steven Martin is picked up off the curb by the irate parking attendant--and later he talks in the car to John Candy about how he feels: sounding like he's inhaled a balloon of helium. And when the car is on the wrong side of the road, Steve Martin looks at John Candy dressed as Satan with that rapturous laughter. How funny! There are just too many funny scenes in this film to go on about. But if you have never viewed the film, I highly recommend it, because it is well worth the purchase.

Most of his work consisted of silly teenage comedies, and overwrought (and violent) slapstick films.  But this film is my favorite of his.  It's no masterpiece, but what really makes it work is the camadrie between Steve Martin and John Candy.  Candy especially gives a wonderful, heartwarming performance.  Sure, the character he plays is kind of dorky, but Candy is so good, you end up liking him anyway.  Martin is a little over the top at times, but he too settles into a nice groove with his character.

241771,AUUH6Z8MSGGF,6300989003,Haunted Flower,"[0, 0]","John Hughes wrote and directed many classic 80s films including ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Sixteen Candles"" and this movie, ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"". It's a long title to say buddy-road-trip-movie, but it works and has his distinctive tones and themes and he was recently and very deservedly honored by the Academy for his achievements.In this film Steve Martin's character Neal is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving and Murphy's law is definitely in effect. All manner of bad luck happens to him, particularly his continued running into Del played by the hysterical and genuine John Candy. Hughes' greatest gift is managing to take broad comedies like these and instilling them with just enough heartfelt moments to make you care about the characters instead of writing them off as incompetent idiots. The gags are wonderfully set up, the long-running jokes killed me, and watching this movie in 2010 really brings to light all the modern conveniences of people not carrying cash anymore, having a plethora of credit cards, and the obvious benefits of cell phone usage. This is a fun movie to play who's who because of all the cameos from actors in his other movies as well as a quick taxi chase down with Kevin Bacon.The major issue that comes to light is how inaccurate the travel times are in this movie. He tries to fly from New York to Chicago but because of bad weather, the plane lands in Kansas. ?!?!?! Of course, then he attempts taking a train that breaks down, a bus that doesn't get them far, and later a rental car. At one point his car is stopped by a sign that specifically says 100 miles to Chicago. They still stop and stay somewhere overnight and when they do continue the next day, it is estimated it will take another three hours. What were the speed limits in the 80's? Distance = rate x time, people! There is no way they would be forced to travel at 33 mph on the highway.The other smaller issue is that you'll notice this film has an R rating which is out of character for a John Hughes movie. It's done mainly for one joke. Steve Martin in a fit of rage at a car rental calendar uses the F word every other word on his tirade against the woman who played the principal's secretary in Ferris Bueller. It is done so at the end, she can use it once deservedly against him. When you're watching it though, it seems so out of tone with the rest because they never really swear the rest of the movie and it easily could have been written without the F bombs and had an equally funny moment that wouldn't feel so jarringly out of place.If you can manage to ignore glaring inconsistencies on the distance and travel time (and even if you can't), you will really enjoy the classic eighties background music and emphasis on a great story. This is a great buddy movie with ridiculous, yet feasibly possible circumstances that will get you right in the funny bone. There aren't many movies out there that I would consider a ""Thanksgiving"" holiday movie, but this would count.DVD Extras:None. This has a widescreen version, subtitles, and an interactive menu. If you want features, I'd recommend the ""Those Aren't Pillows!"" Edtition that has some making-of features including a feature on Adult John Hughes movies.

It has become a tradition and perhaps even a necessity.Neal Page (Steve Martin, back when he was funny) is a Marketing Exec who has just made a pointless trip to New York 2 days before Thanksgiving. The inconclusive meeting in question ends just half an hour before his flight back home. If he hurries, he'll catch the flight no problem and be home with the family before he knows it. Right?Well, no. There are no cabs on Wall Street. After being hustled out of $75 for a cab someone else hailed it promptly takes off with passenger unknown. But no matter, the airport has delayed the flight because of snow. In the waiting lounge, Neal meets Del Griffith (John Candy, man do I miss him!), a shower curtain ring salesman and the very man who went off in his Taxi. Despite Del's insistence on making it up to Neal, he fobs him off and remains in a mood.Once on board the plane the fussy Flight Attendant seats him in coach as there was a mistake with his first class ticket. Guess who he is sat beside? Del of course. And he blabs on and on, telling unfunny, unamusing anecdotes to an increasingly squashed and uncomfortable Neal.A huge snowstorm in Chicago results in the plane being diverted hundreds of miles, all the way down to Wichita, Kansas. Neal is forced to spend the night with Del in a unbelievably seedy motel...in the same bed. That night they are robbed and left with nothing but their credit cards.Since Del is a massive slob who leaves his dirty socks in the sink, crumbs and wrappers everywhere and spills beer on the bed, Neal would like nothing more than to ditch him and get on with his long journey home alone.It's here that the emotional punch of the movie really kicks in. Neal is arrogant and selfish but Del stills sees some good in him and would like nothing more than to be his best buddy. But he is repeatedly kicked aside and ignored as the two of them inch their way home. Fate crosses their paths over and over and Neal is pretty much only temporarily sticking with him to serve himself. Candy's need for a pal and his frustration at Neal only becomes apparent after the first viewing as it's the shocking twist ending that makes you add up his character and emotions.At the time this film was already brilliant, but it's the fact that Del Griffith and John Candy are almost one and the same that makes it that extra bit special. Both were friendly, chatty and tried really hard to be liked. And now that Candy is gone forever you can't help but really, really feel for him and see the trouble he is going through despite his best efforts to hide it. Neal and Del may be opposites but as they both struggle through setback after setback they eventually come to empathise and understand each other.I dare you not be moved to tears when Del is sitting alone in the train station and confesses his secret to Neal. If you are not crying then you truly have no soul.The film ain't just an emotional character drama. It's also a road movie with loads of snow covered middle-America scenery and is extremely funny and packed with classic scenes. Anyone who has seen it already will know what I mean when I say 'THOSE AREN'T PILLOWS!' Del driving on the wrong side of the highway will suffocate you as will Neal's confrontation with the rental car receptionist, the character of Owen (Dylan Baker) and his nasal problems.Ocassionaly, James Ira Newborn's score can be a bit distracting and even slightly inappropriate, but there are some deeply emotional cues in there that can easily shift the mood of a scene. Inconsistent it may be but overall it's better than most comedic scores.Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an eternal tribute to how great Martin used to be before he sold himself out to family movies and how wonderful John Candy was as an actor and a person. For him alone this film gets 5/5. He was brilliant and died far too young, but in his short career he did give us some unforgettable stuff and this movie is certainly one of them.The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound and ZERO extras!",5,An annual tradition.,956620800,"04 25, 2000",2000,4255,"['Even', 'do', 'not', 'celebrate', 'Thanksgiving', 'here', 'Scotland', 'watch', 'film', 'once', 'year', 'get', 'Xmas', 'mood', 'watch', 'loads', 'Xmas', 'movies', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Scrooged', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'become', 'tradition', 'perhaps', 'even', 'necessity.Neal', 'Page', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'funny', 'Marketing', 'Exec', 'who', 'just', 'made', 'pointless', 'trip', 'New', 'York', '2', 'days', 'Thanksgiving', 'inconclusive', 'meeting', 'question', 'ends', 'just', 'hour', 'flight', 'back', 'home', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'flight', 'problem', 'be', 'home', 'family', 'Right', 'Well', 'are', 'cabs', 'Wall', 'Street', 'being', 'hustled', '75', 'cab', 'someone', 'else', 'hailed', 'promptly', 'passenger', 'unknown', 'matter', 'airport', 'delayed', 'flight', 'snow', 'waiting', 'lounge', 'Neal', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'John', 'Candy', 'man', 'do', 'miss', 'shower', 'curtain', 'ring', 'salesman', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'went', 'off', 'Taxi', 'Del', 'insistence', 'making', 'Neal', 'fobs', 'off', 'mood.Once', 'board', 'plane', 'fussy', 'Flight', 'Attendant', 'seats', 'coach', 'was', 'mistake', 'first', 'class', 'ticket', 'Guess', 'who', 'sat', 'Del', 'course', 'telling', 'unfunny', 'unamusing', 'anecdotes', 'increasingly', 'squashed', 'uncomfortable', 'Neal.A', 'huge', 'snowstorm', 'Chicago', 'results', 'plane', 'being', 'diverted', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'way', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'Neal', 'forced', 'spend', 'night', 'Del', 'unbelievably', 'seedy', 'motel', 'same', 'bed', 'night', 'are', 'robbed', 'left', 'nothing', 'credit', 'cards.Since', 'Del', 'massive', 'slob', 'who', 'dirty', 'socks', 'sink', 'crumbs', 'wrappers', 'everywhere', 'spills', 'beer', 'bed', 'Neal', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'ditch', 'get', 'long', 'journey', 'home', 'alone.It', 'here', 'emotional', 'punch', 'movie', 'really', 'Neal', 'arrogant', 'selfish', 'Del', 'good', 'would', 'like', 'nothing', 'more', 'be', 'best', 'buddy', 'repeatedly', 'kicked', 'aside', 'ignored', 'two', 'inch', 'way', 'home', 'Fate', 'paths', 'Neal', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'temporarily', 'sticking', 'serve', 'Candy', 'need', 'pal', 'frustration', 'Neal', 'only', 'apparent', 'first', 'viewing', 'shocking', 'twist', 'ending', 'add', 'up', 'character', 'emotions.At', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'already', 'brilliant', 'fact', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'John', 'Candy', 'are', 'almost', 'one', 'same', 'extra', 'bit', 'special', 'were', 'friendly', 'chatty', 'tried', 'really', 'hard', 'be', 'liked', 'now', 'Candy', 'gone', 'forever', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'really', 'really', 'feel', 'see', 'trouble', 'going', 'best', 'efforts', 'hide', 'Neal', 'Del', 'may', 'be', 'opposites', 'struggle', 'setback', 'setback', 'eventually', 'come', 'empathise', 'understand', 'other.I', 'dare', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'when', 'Del', 'sitting', 'alone', 'train', 'station', 'secret', 'Neal', 'are', 'not', 'crying', 'then', 'truly', 'have', 'soul.The', 'film', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'emotional', 'character', 'drama', 'also', 'road', 'movie', 'loads', 'snow', 'covered', 'middle-America', 'scenery', 'extremely', 'funny', 'packed', 'classic', 'scenes', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'already', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'when', 'say', ""'THOSE"", 'ARE', ""N'T"", 'PILLOWS', 'Del', 'driving', 'wrong', 'side', 'highway', 'will', 'suffocate', 'will', 'Neal', 'confrontation', 'rental', 'car', 'receptionist', 'character', 'Owen', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'nasal', 'problems.Ocassionaly', 'James', 'Ira', 'Newborn', 'score', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'distracting', 'even', 'slightly', 'inappropriate', 'are', 'deeply', 'emotional', 'cues', 'can', 'easily', 'shift', 'mood', 'scene', 'Inconsistent', 'may', 'be', 'overall', 'better', 'most', 'comedic', 'scores.Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'eternal', 'tribute', 'how', 'great', 'Martin', 'used', 'be', 'sold', 'family', 'movies', 'how', 'wonderful', 'John', 'Candy', 'was', 'actor', 'person', 'alone', 'film', '5/5', 'was', 'brilliant', 'died', 'far', 'too', 'young', 'short', 'career', 'did', 'give', 'unforgettable', 'stuff', 'movie', 'certainly', 'one', 'them.The', 'DVD', '1.78:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'ZERO', 'extras']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

But just about everything that could go wrong does, making it unlikely that he will be able to get home in time. A well-meaning but somewhat obnoxious travelling salesman, played by John Candy, compounds his problems by shadowing him along the way.One reason I was disappointed with this film was my high expectations: I've been a fan of the film's screenwriter, John Hughes, since his days writing for National Lampoon magazine in the 1970's.  I've also been a big fan of Steve Martin's brand of comedy, having most of his stand-up comedy albums.  And John Candy is probably the only comedian who could make me laugh without even saying anything.But, while the film has it's laugh-out-loud moments (such as when Candy and Martin share a bed and end up in an accidental almost ""Brokeback"" moment), it just wasn't as funny as I would have expected.In my opinion,the film was saved from mediocraty due to the acting of Martin and Candy, and, especially, due to the films very touching ending.  I won't spoil the film by telling you how it ends, except to say that it evokes the ending of Dicken's ""A Christmas Carol"" and should leave many viewer's misty-eyed.Look out for cameos by Michael McKean (of ""Laverne and Shirley,"" ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Best of Show"" fame) and Kevin Bacon.",4,Saved by the Acting and Ending,1139443200,"02 9, 2006",2006,1399,"['business', 'executive', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'must', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'back', 'family', 'Chicago', 'Thanksgiving', 'just', 'everything', 'could', 'go', 'wrong', 'making', 'unlikely', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'home', 'time', 'well-meaning', 'somewhat', 'obnoxious', 'travelling', 'salesman', 'played', 'John', 'Candy', 'problems', 'shadowing', 'way.One', 'reason', 'was', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'high', 'expectations', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'film', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'Hughes', 'days', 'writing', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'magazine', '1970', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'brand', 'comedy', 'having', 'most', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'albums', 'John', 'Candy', 'probably', 'only', 'comedian', 'who', 'could', 'make', 'even', 'saying', 'anything.But', 'film', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Candy', 'Martin', 'share', 'bed', 'end', 'up', 'accidental', 'almost', 'Brokeback', 'moment', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'expected.In', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'saved', 'mediocraty', 'due', 'acting', 'Martin', 'Candy', 'especially', 'due', 'films', 'very', 'touching', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'film', 'telling', 'how', 'say', 'ending', 'Dicken', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Carol', 'should', 'leave', 'many', 'viewer', 'misty-eyed.Look', 'cameos', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'Spinal', 'Tap', 'Best', 'Show', 'fame', 'Kevin', 'Bacon']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

Yes, it is regarded as a comedy but when I think of it I think of it as more of a drama. The jokes don't get old. This is probably my favorite comedy of all time. Hughes takes the traveling nightmare genre to a whole new level. It's more a triumph in script writing than anythingFor those who don't already know Planes, Trains and Automobiles is simple in its approach. Everything that can go wrong does. It's a comic routine that can be funny, but here it is a trip to hysterical. The plot is simple enough as well. Neal Page (Steve Martin) is on his way home for Thanksgiving. He's your typical businessman that works in New York and has a family he wants to see in Chicago. The only problem is everything from delayed flights to ripped up car tickets happen on the way. Only worsening matters, Del Griffith (John Candy), is along for the ride. An annoying shower curtain ring salesman, Neal can't get rid of him no matter how hard he tries.John Candy gives the performance of his too short career as the traveling shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith. What makes Candy's performance so impressive is that while Del is an obnoxious, annoying slob, Candy shows that this is a very lonely, sweet, kind, and caring man with a great heart. This is a man who is putting his needs behind the needs of another person, a complete stranger in Neil Page. Candy creates an incredibly complex man, who the audience really gets to know and genuinely care about. They say comedies are the hardest films to get nominated for Oscars, which is true. And while ""PT & A"" is no Best Picture winner, it certainly in my mind has a performance not just worthy of a nomination but of an Oscar as well. It would be interesting to see how Candy's performance would be regarded if the film came out today.The ending, whew!, it's a rough one. And again, despite all the wonderful comedy in this film, whenever I think of ""PT & A"" I think of the wonderful character of Del Griffith and the powerful ending. If you haven't seen this movie, rent it. I strongly recommend it as a first rate comedy that doesn't come along often. Whether it's the music capturing the perfect mood in the hilarious bedroom scene or meeting Owen, it's an earnestly frantic and tender trip through the modern transportation system.",5,It is ironic that the best movie that John Hughes made wasn't a teen movie,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2378,"['When', 'think', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'smile', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'Yes', 'regarded', 'comedy', 'when', 'think', 'think', 'more', 'drama', 'jokes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'old', 'probably', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'time', 'Hughes', 'traveling', 'nightmare', 'genre', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'more', 'triumph', 'script', 'writing', 'anythingFor', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'simple', 'approach', 'Everything', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'comic', 'routine', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'here', 'trip', 'hysterical', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'as', 'well', 'Neal', 'Page', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'way', 'home', 'Thanksgiving', 'typical', 'businessman', 'New', 'York', 'family', 'see', 'Chicago', 'only', 'problem', 'everything', 'delayed', 'flights', 'ripped', 'up', 'car', 'tickets', 'happen', 'way', 'Only', 'worsening', 'matters', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'John', 'Candy', 'along', 'ride', 'annoying', 'shower', 'curtain', 'ring', 'salesman', 'Neal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'rid', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'Candy', 'performance', 'too', 'short', 'career', 'traveling', 'shower', 'curtain', 'ring', 'salesman', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'What', 'Candy', 'performance', 'so', 'impressive', 'Del', 'obnoxious', 'annoying', 'slob', 'Candy', 'very', 'lonely', 'sweet', 'kind', 'caring', 'man', 'great', 'heart', 'man', 'who', 'putting', 'needs', 'needs', 'person', 'complete', 'stranger', 'Neil', 'Page', 'Candy', 'incredibly', 'complex', 'man', 'who', 'audience', 'really', 'know', 'genuinely', 'care', 'say', 'comedies', 'are', 'hardest', 'films', 'get', 'nominated', 'Oscars', 'true', 'PT', 'A', 'Best', 'Picture', 'winner', 'certainly', 'mind', 'performance', 'not', 'just', 'worthy', 'nomination', 'Oscar', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'how', 'Candy', 'performance', 'would', 'be', 'regarded', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'today.The', 'ending', 'whew', 'rough', 'one', 'again', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'film', 'whenever', 'think', 'PT', 'A', 'think', 'wonderful', 'character', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'powerful', 'ending', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'rent', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'first', 'rate', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'often', 'music', 'capturing', 'perfect', 'mood', 'hilarious', 'bedroom', 'scene', 'meeting', 'Owen', 'earnestly', 'frantic', 'tender', 'trip', 'modern', 'transportation', 'system']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

Traveling is nuts though and if he's going to get home he's gonna have to rely on a talkative and clingy but good-hearted salesman (John Candy). It's predictable that he's going to keep bumping into to Candy whether he wants to or not and that they're gonna keep having to travel together whether he like it or not.Plus you know Candy is going to drive him more and more crazy. Yet when it tacks on a heart-warming ending and gets you to feel bad for Candy you can't help feeling like you just saw something special.

Also, there are deleted scenes shown on Network Television (such as TNT) and they aren't even included here!

This isn't meant to be a slapstick, broad comedy, but it has elements of that.  Martin and Candy are a mismatched pair of travelers on the way home to Chicago from NYC for Thanksgiving.  Along the way they fall victim to every travel nightmare imaginable.  Though Martin has his funny scenes, he is basically playing the straight man to Candy's Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman who latches on to Martin's Neal Page, an ad exec used to FAR more luxurious travel conditions than this fateful trip will present.  At its heart, however, is a story of how these two people from different social classes form an unlikely friendship, albeit a friendship that is tested over and over under frustrating circumstances that would try even the most patient traveller.  Both men must learn some ugly truths about each's own character, and both must learn to be more accepting of the other's faults.  Hardly a recipe for hilarity, but it works.I've yet to meet someone who saw this movie and didn't love it.  I've owned this movie on VHS for years, and watched it dozens of times, but I'm buying it on DVD anyway.

Since Candy is great at playing the obnoxious, yet loveable loud mouth and Martin is great at playing neurotic and cynical men...The pairing of these two was genius. Martin plays an advertising executive named Neal Page, who needs to catch a plane at 6 to get from New York to Chicago in order to spend Thanksgiving with his family. Problem is, he's in a meeting that his boss isn't letting him out of until 5:30. After Neal unsuccessfully races a young kid (Kevin Bacon) to catch a cab, he bribes a cab off of a lawyer. Then suddenly the cab is gone, stolen by someone else. When Neal finally gets to the airport, his flight is delayed; But, while waiting, he meets the man who took his cab Del Griffith (Candy). Del is a shower curtain ring salesmen, who is also traveling to Chicago to be with his wife. When Neal finally gets on the plane, his seat is next to Del's. The plane winds up landing in Wichita, due to bad weather and all the motels are booked. But Del has a friend who owes him a favor at a motel, so Neal and Del share a motel room. Coincidences that bring these two back together happen throughout the movie, and while they're completely unrealistic...That doesn't keep this movie from being a comedic masterpiece. John Candy and Steve Martin are really at the peak of their comedic powers in this movie; The physical humor, the verbal humor, and every other kind of humor in this movie is done so well...You can't help but laugh at Candy's antics and those antics that are caused by him. The car debacle is just a classic scene. This is not only a comedy classic, but it's also one of the best films by Hughes, Candy, Martin, or any other person involved.

Unfortunately, there is no director's cut of this film, nor are there additional scenes.  This is surprising in that longer versions of this movie have already appeared on television.  Indeed, the televised TBS/TNT version includes additional scenes including an extended airline meal sequence.  The other interesting aspect of the televised version, which is not yet available on DVD as an option, is that alternate takes were used.  This is most obvious in the scene where Steve Martin uses some explicatives when dealing with the rental car lady.

241841,A1URXSRV6WDHVY,6300989003,Marty Gillis,"[7, 7]","'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' may very well be John Hughes' greatest film although he wrote and directed SO MANY absolute classics that it is a highly subjective statement.  Regardless, I truly LOVE this film and watch it without fail at least once a year.  The story and script, the inspired casting and direction, superb music placement/score and a performance of a lifetime by the great John Candy and you have more than enough elements for a perennial classic.  With that said, this review will focus on the actual Blu Ray product, the video and audio aspects and the included extras.This is the third time I have purchased this film. The first was on VHS, then DVD and finally Blu Ray disc.  IS it worth the money to upgrade to Blu ray?The answer is YES YES and YES!!  For those who don't wish to read all the details as to WHY this is a good upgrade, let's just say the uptick on both picture and sound makes this Blu Ray release the best possible way to enjoy this movie in your home. EVERYTHING has been noticeably improved.So how is the picture quality?  Basically, everything is resolved better with a nice crisp sharp image for the most part. Other review sites have complained about overuse of DNR and frozen/floating grain. I honestly never had a problem with that while watching. In fact, I saw PLENTY of detail in both backgrounds, objects and faces. Print damage is almost non existent.  Sure this isn't a  meticulous restoration done in 4K and it isn't demo material either, BUT if you love this film you will be VERY pleased! And the color palette is EXCELLENT! The original color timing appears to have been kept and you get very strong primaries along with decent (if not perfect) flesh tones for the most part of this transfer.  Compared to the lackluster Blu Ray releases of the original 'Arthur' , or '48 Hours' , 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' looks GREAT on Blu Ray.How about the sound? As good or better than the DVD?  Again the answer is a resounding YES!  With a nice sounding 5.1 mix presented in DTS HD Master Audio,  there is a HUGE improvement in overall audio fidelity.  At times I did think the dialogue was mixed a bit low for my tastes compared to my DVD version with the ""F Bomb"" scene seeming to me to be mixed just a bit lower than what I am used to hearing, but most of it sounds fine with all the music during this film benefiting the most from the upgrade to DTS HD Master Audio.  Overall this is a most welcome upgrade for the audio portion of this disc.The included extras are great, especially the two part documentary about write/director/filmmaker John Hughes.  Mr. Hughes was pretty media shy and what is presented is a veritable treasure trove for fans. Interspersed between new footage from the now grown actors who played such a huge part in his films and older archival footage of Hughes himself a picture emerges of the man that provides a greater insight into his creative process than ever before. For me it was worth the price of the disc just to see THIS portion alone.  Also included are a few small snippets from a film press conference with John, Steve Martin and John Candy, although John Candy does not speak during any of them. There is a longish ""making of"" documentary that clocks in around 17 minutes which is good for at least one viewing and finally you get a deleted scene in SD that takes place during their initial plane trip that lasts about 3 minutes. All in all, a very good extras section.'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' may not be Shakespeare and John Hughes may not be Orson Welles but I find his films and writing just as valid and important. John Hughes filled a niche that no one else did. His stories and characters are REAL in as much as they have REAL feelings that we all can relate to. Whether they feature kids , teenagers or adults, all of John Hughes' films had that one thing in common. They All speak from the heart and TO the heart and this film speaks more loudly than some.If you are a fan of John Hughes films any actor in this film or the film itself or all of the above then this Blu Ray presentation is a great way to enjoy it again and again. Could the transfer have been done a bit better?  Yes, but as it is this is absolutely the best way to enjoy this film and I have ZERO buyers remorse.

(August 2008) These are basically just repackaged dvds with some new cover designs intended to tie-in with vH1's 'I love the 80's' merchandising and the second 'disc' is really just a bonus audio music cd of popular 80's singles with all of a whopping 4 tracks on the disc. The movie does have some newly enhanced audio and an alledged deleted scene somewhere within the movie according to the back cover but I never noticed anything strikingly different from the original version.This 'I love the 80's' movie series from Paramount rereleases are fine if all you're after is just the movie itself. But just don't expect anything different or new and if you're hoping for a two-disc MOVIE special edition loaded with all kinds of extra features like I was, you might be a little ticked off. My advice is that it's probably best to just skip these and wait for some REAL special editions of these films if there ever are any in the works.Paramount can do better and it's clear they didn't put any real thought or care into these releases.",2,Buyer Beware.

Being from Scotland, we don't celebrate Thanksgiving, although I think we should - America looks like so much fun. And it's a great start to Christmas.I've previously done a review for this. Looking back on it, it had to be deleted. Straight away. It was five lines long, so hopefully Amazon will repost this, hopefully, much better review. (HA!)I have to admit, this movie is better on a second watching. I can't remember really enjoying it the first time round as I did this time. I found myself giggling a lot more, but also, maybe I was feeling really emotional that night watching this, but I also ended up crying at a couple of points. It's actually, beneath all the funny moments, a really sad movie. The scene in the motel bedroom where Steve Martin's character points out all John Candy's bad points is utterly convincing, and that's the point I did start crying. John acted it really well, with his bottom lip quivering. But his comeback just makes it all the worse:""You wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right, I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me; I'm not changing. I like... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.""The other scene I started crying at, was when Del couldn't get a room at the motel, cos he only had $2, and a Casio watch, and he had to sit in the burnt out car. Talking to his wife who wasn't there. Yes I did cry again. It's such a sad movie.But it's also hilarious. It's definitely one of Steve Martin's best movies, and he agrees it's his favourite movie of his own. He comes out with some absolute classic lines in this, but I'm not going to repeat them all here. If you've seen the movie, you know what they are.Roll on Christmas is all I can say after watching this movie, and now I want to start wrapping presents.

This John Hughes directed, produced, and written film is a far departure from many of the alleged comedies that grace the movie theatres these days that rely on gross out humor, sexual innuendo amped up to ten, or situations that are stretched to wildly fantastic levels of absurdity. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is an old school comedy with a message about finding friendship in unexpected places.Neil Page (Steve Martin) plays an uptight advertising executive trying to get home to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving. Page&#8217;s plans and attitude changes when he meets the loveable, if somewhat grating shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith (John Candy). Through a series of spectacular incidents, the polar opposites become bonded together as they make their way throughout the Midwest in an effort to get Neil home for  Thanksgiving.Beyond having two comedy masters in Candy and Martin and the grand vision of John Hughes, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles succeeds in my view because the situation is highly realistic---I mean who hasn&#8217;t had a trip that hasn&#8217;t gone according to plan?

241861,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,6300989003,Monty Moonlight,"[1, 1]","As much as I consider myself a movie lover and film fanatic, and as large of a collection of movies as I have, there are some truly beloved classics I have been late to the party for. One such film is ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"". For YEARS, I'd heard how wonderful it was and how it is the Thanksgiving standard for most people who watch movies. Somehow though, I never saw it. I LOVE Steve Martin and John Candy and I'm a holiday freak, but I just never saw this one until last year, when I received the Blu-Ray as a gift from a friend.The film is basically an odd couple road trip movie in which a miserable rich guy finds himself repeatedly stuck as travel companion to a constantly optimistic and cheerful salesman of a distinctly lower rung as they try to get home for Thanksgiving. That might not be how late, great writer/producer/director of the film John Hughes would describe it exactly. I think what I see as ""rich"", he saw as upper middle class, but his upper middle class characters definitely count as rich in my neck of the woods. Candy's character is named Del, a man who probably WOULD be difficult to travel with, but who takes it on the chin from uptight Neal pretty much from the get-go. The two have unceasing troubles, but most of them are worse for Neal, more than anything because he is just not used to this kind of travel (and he certainly doesn't have the disposition for it).As I said, this film is beloved, and there are many reasons for that. Just to name a few: One, it's got two of the greatest comedic actors in history. Two, it's directed by John Hughes, a legend to be sure. Three, and this is probably a pretty crucial reason, it's a Thanksgiving movie, and there really aren't many of those to be found. Hardly any, oddly enough (though I have my pitch for one I shared on my own site fairly recently). Myself, I am rather selective about the works of John Hughes. Some of his films I LOVE, some I just think are okay, and some don't appeal to me much at all. And, if you take a look at his filmography, you might be surprised at some of the films he penned. Some you probably thought were surely stinkers, like Baby's Day Out, or others you probably thought were simply ripoffs of previous John Hughes films, funnily enough. In fact, I just discovered he also wrote ""Dutch"", a movie I enjoyed at least as much as ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"", if not more, but with striking similarities. It's, again, a mishap ridden roadtrip to get an odd couple home in time for Thanksgiving.Focusing on Planes/Trains though, this movie has its goods and bads. Overall, I enjoy it and the final scene makes it all worthwhile. It IS a good movie, no doubt, but not my ideal Thanksgiving movie by any means. To be honest, it has little to do with Thanksgiving except that we know the holiday is the passion driving Neal's desire to get home in a hurry. Well, joining his beloved family for the holiday, rather. For the most part though, it's a lot of road trip mishaps and bad experiences that are funny, sometimes hilarious, but sometimes a bit too serious to be either. John Hughes can make some hilarious comedies, and he can do some great dramas. This film has a lot of both. It wants to lean more on the comedy, at least that's the way its marketed, but in truth, though I love Steve Martin, the frequent anger of the Neal character sometimes is too much of a dark cloud over everything. I know most won't agree with me, but I wish this movie was a bit more lighthearted. It's powerful in the way these characters learn from each other, especially Neal learning from Del, and I get the sharp contrast between the characters' personalities, but as a movie I've twice found myself watching on Thanksgiving night with family, I think I'd have enjoyed it more if there was a bit less hate in Neal's anger. It's realistic though, not the usual, Steve Martin, over-the-top funny kind of angry. It's well done, and it's classic John Hughes in that this movie is full of very realistic characters well portrayed. Watching it, it's recognizable as a Hughes 80's film (though distinctly a later one), even if you've never seen it before. But, ya know, I think even a bit more holiday imagery might have made the anger more tolerable. I realize the point was probably that the holiday feeling was a goal that needed to be reached, but again, this all makes it seem less of a holiday treat and more of an anytime movie. So, maybe this WASN'T intended to be a Thanksgiving perennial? I don't really know. Then again, those final scenes are perfect for Thanksgiving evening and will surely bring a tear to your eye if you have a heart at all.With a generally positive feeling towards this movie, I'll comment negatively on one other thing, and that's the film's music. I just wasn't loving the score. I suppose that's just me, but I didn't care for it. There are songs in the movie that are good enough (I'm not wild about much of the 80's Hughes music/songs used in general though, I'll admit, with some exceptions), but the basic instrumental stuff I just found weird. However, if I continue to watch this traditionally, it's possible the music will grow on me. I think the fact that I didn't grow up watching this one as a tradition is partly why you readers probably think I'm being a bit hard on it. There's a lot to be said for the power of nostalgia.Having said all that, I do like this movie overall. It is no Home Alone, Sixteen Candles, Vacation, Weird Science or Ferris Bueller for me, but, ya know, I'm not a big Breakfast Club, She's Having a Baby or Pretty in Pink fan. I guess I lean towards the pure comedies when it comes to John Hughes, and while I feel this film was supposed to be in that camp, I think it's actually smack dab in the middle, and that's probably why my feelings on it are pretty mixed.Now, as for the blu-ray, it looks and sounds fantastic. There is, sadly, no commentary track, but there are some very nice bonus features, particularly focusing on tributes to the late John Hughes and John Candy. We also get a deleted scene with a pretty attractive stewardess getting angry. The featurettes have some great ""back in the day"" interviews with Steve Martin, John Candy, and John Hughes, and it's really nice to see that on here. If you can land a slipcover, there's a pretty nice holographic one out there. It's a pretty sweet release. The only major negative, aside from lacking the basics of a commentary track and theatrical trailer, is that the menu is a bit hard to work. By that, I mean that it is very hard to see which text is highlighted for selection, as it goes from dark blue to black when highlighted and is very hard to distinguish. It becomes a bit of a guessing game to go through the special features. But, that's my biggest quibble. This is, for the most part, a really nice release for a movie that is much loved and, though a bit heavy for me at times with a holiday comedy viewing in mind, is very powerful overall. I know I will enjoy watching this movie repeatedly, though I haven't found my ideal Thanksgiving movie yet.",4,"A very moving film, if not my idea of the perfect Thanksgiving movie.",1385683200,"11

Pretty much every scene in planes trains and automobiles is hysterical. It gets funnier and funnier. The ideas were genius, like when they walked into the hotel room, and saw one medium sized bed only, lol. And when steve martin grabbed the towel to dry his face off, only to open his eyes to john candy's huge dirty underwear, is without a doubt the funniest scene in movie history. lol.

Absolutely hilarious film about a traveling marketing agent (Martin) who starts out in NY City during a business meeting and has to get home to Chicago in time for his family's Thanksgiving dinner. Along the way, he keeps getting detoured to different parts of the country via plane, train, and automobile (as well as other means of transportation) by none other than Del Griffith (Candy). At the beginning of the movie, he meets Del Griffith, the shower curtain ring salesman who is a slob in both dress and manner, and who unintentionally keeps messing up Martin's plans on getting back to Chicago. Many will know this movie by its popular phrase ""those aren't pillows!"" Absolutely funny movie.The reason I gave this a 4/5 stars is due to the one scene where Martin drops the F bomb about 18 times in under a minute, expressing his misfortune to the car rental woman. I believe that if this film didn't have that scene, it would only be rated PG-13 instead of R. Other than that, there's no sexual scenes (unless you count the scene where a young couple is smooching violently on the bus for a few seconds) and so I think this movie is pretty decent if you know where to 'fast forward'. There are other mildly crude words spoken by Candy and Martin, but it's not so dirty that it's every other sentence. Overall, this movie has quite a charming story that ends pretty slow paced, but wraps up nicely with Martin and Candy resolving their differences by being kind to each other and being sincere about it.

From the moment at the subway station as they say good-bye up until the heartwarming ending at Neil Page's house, it is what pulls this movie out of the bottomless pit of hilarious buddy comedies and into the hallowed halls of truly great movies.But, before all of that occurs, for most of the first hour-and-a-half this film is just plain gut-busting, slap-your-knee, and pee-in-your-pants funny. Neil Page, played by Steve Martin, is an uptight advertising executive on business in New York. As the film opens, he is late for a plane that is taking him home to Chicago so he can spend Thanksgiving with his family. From the start, things are going horribly wrong, as he finds it damn-near impossible to get a cab in the holiday traffic especially when the cab he's flagged is stolen right from under his nose by a guy in a blue parka with a HUGE suitcase. He finally gets to the airport and finds he's been bumped from first class to coach, then when he sits down he finds himself seated right next to (""Is this a coincidence or what?"") the guy who stole his cab. That guy is Del Griffith, played by John Candy, who is, um, let me clear my throat, ahem, a shower-curtain ring salesman. No, really, I'm serious. After their plane is forced to land in Kansas due to a severe snowstorm, they share a dingy, low-class motel room together. The whole scene where the two of them are forced to share a bed together has to be one of THE funniest moments in cinema history, fa'real. Anyways, to make a long story short, these two end up being companions as they travel all over the map struggling to get to Chicago. They try taking a train, a Greyhound, a rental car, and absolutely everything that could possibly go wrong does. And it does so in utterly hilarious ways. Del Griffith is a well-meaning and likeable fella, but he seems to be a bad luck charm for Neil, who is NOT a very tolerable person. These two just can't seem to get anything right.What shocks me the most is how the majority of movie critics of the day thought that this film was over-indulgent and badly-scripted. This is the part where I squint my eyes, shake my head and scream ""WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU!?"" I mean, really, this is one of the funniest, most involving and most consistently entertaining movies I've ever seen. I've seen it countless times since it first came out and I make a point to watch it at least once every year at Thanksgiving time. Not once has the comedy ever felt stale or the touching moments ceased to water my eyes.The bottom line is that this film is VASTLY underrated. The late John Candy does what I feel is his best work here. The speech he gives to Neil in the motel room after Neil's extended rant about what a boorish person he is, is really touching and inspiring. The way Candy says the lines, he never misses a note and his emotion feels so real, ""You can think what you want about me. I'm not changin'. I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cuz I'm the real article. What ya see is what ya get."" It really makes me miss John Candy and wish he hadn't been taken from us so soon. Steve Martin turns in a great performance too, no matter how cold and selfish he seems at times, you always feel that deep down there is room for good in him. And it eventually emerges. This is an all-out hilarious movie with some of the funniest looks, moments, and situations in movie history. It never once misses the mark. And, maybe I sound a little cheesy, but it also is very moving, and speaks volumes about friendship and the way we treat people.",5,STILL one of the funniest movies I've ever seen...,1017878400,"04 4, 2002",2002,4080,"['hold', 'phone', 'wait', 'just', 'minute', 'Am', 'just', 'sensitive', 'sap', 'there', 'something', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'heart', 'film', 'going', 'specifics', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'made', 'strong', 'manly', 'eyes', 'well', 'tears', 'brought', 'sad', 'smile', 'face', 'just', 'point', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'Neil', 'Page', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'who', 'despised', 'other', 'most', 'travels', 'together', 'realize', 'how', 'deep', 'friendship', 'runs', 'how', 'positively', 'affecting', 'two', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'moment', 'subway', 'station', 'say', 'good-bye', 'up', 'heartwarming', 'ending', 'Neil', 'Page', 'house', 'what', 'movie', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'hilarious', 'buddy', 'comedies', 'hallowed', 'halls', 'truly', 'great', 'movies.But', 'most', 'first', 'hour-and-a-half', 'film', 'just', 'plain', 'gut-busting', 'slap-your-knee', 'pee-in-your-pants', 'funny', 'Neil', 'Page', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'uptight', 'advertising', 'executive', 'business', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'late', 'plane', 'taking', 'home', 'Chicago', 'can', 'spend', 'Thanksgiving', 'family', 'start', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'damn-near', 'impossible', 'get', 'cab', 'holiday', 'traffic', 'especially', 'when', 'cab', 'flagged', 'stolen', 'right', 'nose', 'guy', 'blue', 'parka', 'HUGE', 'suitcase', 'finally', 'airport', 'been', 'bumped', 'first', 'class', 'coach', 'then', 'when', 'down', 'seated', 'right', 'next', 'coincidence', 'what', 'guy', 'who', 'stole', 'cab', 'guy', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'played', 'John', 'Candy', 'who', 'um', 'let', 'clear', 'throat', 'ahem', 'shower-curtain', 'ring', 'salesman', 'No', 'really', ""'m"", 'serious', 'plane', 'forced', 'land', 'Kansas', 'due', 'severe', 'snowstorm', 'share', 'dingy', 'low-class', 'motel', 'room', 'together', 'whole', 'scene', 'where', 'two', 'are', 'forced', 'share', 'bed', 'together', 'be', 'one', 'THE', 'funniest', 'moments', 'cinema', 'history', ""fa'real"", 'Anyways', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'two', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'companions', 'travel', 'map', 'struggling', 'get', 'Chicago', 'try', 'taking', 'train', 'Greyhound', 'rental', 'car', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'so', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'ways', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'well-meaning', 'likeable', 'fella', 'be', 'bad', 'luck', 'charm', 'Neil', 'who', 'NOT', 'very', 'tolerable', 'person', 'two', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'anything', 'right.What', 'most', 'how', 'majority', 'movie', 'critics', 'day', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'over-indulgent', 'badly-scripted', 'part', 'where', 'squint', 'eyes', 'shake', 'head', 'scream', 'WHAT', 'MATTER', 'WITH', 'YOU', 'mean', 'really', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'involving', 'most', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'first', 'came', 'make', 'point', 'watch', 'least', 'once', 'year', 'Thanksgiving', 'time', 'Not', 'once', 'comedy', 'ever', 'felt', 'stale', 'touching', 'moments', 'ceased', 'water', 'eyes.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'film', 'VASTLY', 'underrated', 'late', 'John', 'Candy', 'what', 'feel', 'best', 'work', 'here', 'speech', 'Neil', 'motel', 'room', 'Neil', 'extended', 'rant', 'what', 'boorish', 'person', 'really', 'touching', 'inspiring', 'way', 'Candy', 'lines', 'never', 'note', 'emotion', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'can', 'think', 'what', 'want', ""'m"", 'not', 'changin', 'wife', 'customers', ""'m"", 'real', 'article', 'What', 'ya', 'see', 'what', 'ya', 'get', 'really', 'miss', 'John', 'Candy', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'taken', 'so', 'soon', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'great', 'performance', 'too', 'matter', 'how', 'cold', 'selfish', 'times', 'always', 'feel', 'deep', 'room', 'good', 'eventually', 'all-out', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'funniest', 'looks', 'moments', 'situations', 'movie', 'history', 'never', 'once', 'mark', 'maybe', 'sound', 'little', 'cheesy', 'also', 'very', 'moving', 'volumes', 'friendship', 'way', 'treat', 'people']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

241882,A1EAAH5UM5P8SB,6300989003,"oldpink ""Dark Side of the Moon""","[3, 3]","When I first saw this movie about twenty years ago, I was just knocked out by how perfect it was, with the very funny Steve Martin and the late great John Candy getting the most out of John Hughes's brilliant script.Hughes was very clever in writing a script that had so much humor wrapped around an incredibly touching core story, because those brief moments of seriousness are all the more powerful.The story in brief is that Steve Martin (character name Neil Page) has been working away from home for an extended period and runs into an endless string of transportation woes trying to return to his home in the Chicago area.He incidentally runs into John Candy (character name Dell Griffith), a gregarious, annoying, chatty traveling salesman.Did I mention that Dell seems to have a hint of loneliness about him?Dell joins Neil by trying to help him in his quest to get back home, but all manner of problems arise, such as foul weather diverting their flight, train breakdowns, and (funniest of all) a missing rental car.Watch for the very funny Edie McClurq in the famous scene with that missing rental car.Neil would rather ditch the annoying Dell and go it alone, but somehow he winds up in all manner of incredibly funny situations with him, including the one that gave this special edition its name that is honestly one of the funniest in film history.As I said, this is a comedy, but there are some serious moments that are only enhanced by the humor, including the one near the end that I consider the climax of the story.I won't spoil it for you, but it is the main reason that I look at this as something so much more than a funny movie.You'll laugh, and (yes, corny, I know) you'll cry, and you won't mind doing it, either.This movie is just THAT good.An interesting personal observation I have is that - just as with the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - all the people I know of who have seen it love it.I have yet to hear from anyone who did not like it.I also wanted to briefly detail the extra features this has over the stock and stripped down original DVD release.First, the original release only had the movie and the trailer...nothing else.This special edition has some extra features, including:1) Getting There is Half the Fun: The Story of Planes Trains and Automobiles - a very nice interview with Candy, Martin, and John Hughes about the making of the movie, plus some of the cast and crew talking about the entire process.2) Deleted Scene - ""Airplane Food"" - This one runs for about five minutes, and it has some humor, but I can definitely see why they chose to edit it out for the finished product. I still enjoyed it for the bit of extra interplay between Martin and Candy.3) John Hughes for Adults - a very good tribute to director/writer John Hughes4) A Tribute to John Candy - MAJOR kudos to the DVD producers for adding this moving tip of the hat to the real star of this movie. Even now, the casting directors nearly choke up on camera talking about his incredible performance, especially that key scene I mentioned above.Also, this is mixed in full Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, so the airplanes passing Steve Martin as he stomps down the runway really sound terrific, among other things.The only thing really missing from this is a commentary track, but since Candy and Hughes are now both deceased, the chances for that are very remote indeed.Considering how glad I was to have the tributes to both men, I happily trade the commentary for the recognition of both for their great talent.Anyone who has not seen this movie before really owes it to himself (or herself) to buy this one, since you will want to watch this over again through the years; it is just that good.Anyone who has already seen it would do well to get this version, as it will probably be definitive until a Blu-Ray comes out.Trust me, you won't regret this one, folks!",5,A worthy upgrade of one of the all time greatest holiday movies,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,3873,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'just', 'knocked', 'out', 'how', 'perfect', 'was', 'very', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'late', 'great', 'John', 'Candy', 'getting', 'most', 'John', 'Hughes', 'brilliant', 'script.Hughes', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'writing', 'script', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'humor', 'wrapped', 'incredibly', 'touching', 'core', 'story', 'brief', 'moments', 'seriousness', 'are', 'more', 'powerful.The', 'story', 'brief', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'character', 'name', 'Neil', 'Page', 'been', 'working', 'away', 'home', 'extended', 'period', 'endless', 'string', 'transportation', 'woes', 'trying', 'return', 'home', 'Chicago', 'area.He', 'incidentally', 'John', 'Candy', 'character', 'name', 'Dell', 'Griffith', 'gregarious', 'annoying', 'chatty', 'traveling', 'salesman.Did', 'mention', 'Dell', 'have', 'hint', 'loneliness', 'Dell', 'Neil', 'trying', 'help', 'quest', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'manner', 'problems', 'arise', 'such', 'foul', 'diverting', 'flight', 'train', 'breakdowns', 'funniest', 'missing', 'rental', 'car.Watch', 'very', 'funny', 'Edie', 'McClurq', 'famous', 'scene', 'missing', 'rental', 'car.Neil', 'would', 'rather', 'ditch', 'annoying', 'Dell', 'go', 'alone', 'somehow', 'up', 'manner', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'situations', 'including', 'one', 'gave', 'special', 'edition', 'name', 'honestly', 'one', 'funniest', 'film', 'history.As', 'said', 'comedy', 'are', 'serious', 'moments', 'are', 'only', 'enhanced', 'humor', 'including', 'one', 'end', 'consider', 'climax', 'story.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'main', 'reason', 'look', 'something', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'funny', 'movie.You', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'yes', 'corny', 'know', ""'ll"", 'cry', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'doing', 'either.This', 'movie', 'just', 'THAT', 'good.An', 'interesting', 'personal', 'observation', 'have', 'just', 'movie', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'love', 'it.I', 'have', 'yet', 'hear', 'anyone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'it.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'briefly', 'detail', 'extra', 'features', 'over', 'stock', 'stripped', 'down', 'original', 'DVD', 'release.First', 'original', 'release', 'only', 'had', 'movie', 'trailer', 'nothing', 'else.This', 'special', 'edition', 'extra', 'features', 'including:1', 'Getting', 'Fun', 'Story', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'very', 'nice', 'interview', 'Candy', 'Martin', 'John', 'Hughes', 'making', 'movie', 'cast', 'crew', 'talking', 'entire', 'process.2', 'Deleted', 'Scene', 'Airplane', 'Food', 'one', 'five', 'minutes', 'humor', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'why', 'chose', 'edit', 'out', 'finished', 'product', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'extra', 'interplay', 'Martin', 'Candy.3', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Adults', 'very', 'good', 'tribute', 'director/writer', 'John', 'Hughes4', 'A', 'Tribute', 'John', 'Candy', 'MAJOR', 'kudos', 'DVD', 'producers', 'adding', 'moving', 'tip', 'hat', 'real', 'star', 'movie', 'Even', 'now', 'casting', 'directors', 'nearly', 'choke', 'up', 'camera', 'talking', 'incredible', 'performance', 'especially', 'key', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'above.Also', 'mixed', 'full', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'sound', 'airplanes', 'passing', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'down', 'runway', 'really', 'sound', 'terrific', 'other', 'things.The', 'only', 'thing', 'really', 'missing', 'commentary', 'track', 'Candy', 'Hughes', 'are', 'now', 'deceased', 'chances', 'are', 'very', 'remote', 'indeed.Considering', 'how', 'glad', 'was', 'have', 'tributes', 'men', 'happily', 'trade', 'commentary', 'recognition', 'great', 'talent.Anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'really', 'buy', 'one', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'years', 'just', 'good.Anyone', 'who', 'already', 'seen', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'get', 'version', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'definitive', 'Blu-Ray', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'one']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

241900,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6300989003,Reviewer,"[6, 9]","If you've ever had to spend time on the road for business, you know how it feels to just want to get back home, especially for a holiday like Thanksgiving; the family's waiting for you, there'll be a fire in the fireplace and a turkey dinner with all the trimmings.  All you have to do is get from here to there.  But that's when Murphy's Law concerning best laid plans often comes into play, and the simplest things become obstacles of monumental proportions, which is exactly what happens in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" a comedy of monumental proportions, written and directed by John Hughes.  Neal Page (Steve Martin) is in New York on business; it's two days before Thanksgiving and he has a plane waiting to take him back home to Chicago.  He has his reservation, and it's not that far to go; but it's a holiday and the weather is chancy, and beginning with the trouble Neal has just getting a cab to take him to the airport, he's about to become mired in frustration as one thing after another thwarts his attempts to get home.  Not to worry, however, once on the plane he meets a guy named Del Griffith (John Candy), a showercurtain-ring salesman with all the answers and connections in seemingly every city in the country.  Which comes in handy-- or maybe not-- for Neal, when the weather in Chicago forces a closure at the airport and his flight gets diverted to Wichita, Kansas.  But that's only the beginning of Neal's problems, because Del Griffith is on the job, and he's the guy to know in a situation like this.  Or not.  And the next couple of days become a comedy of errors that takes Neal to the edge of sanity and the audience to the edge of hilarity.An astute student of human nature, John Hughes takes his observations and insights and translates them in this film into a story with which just about anyone is going to be able to identify.  We've all been in Neal's situation at one time or another, in one way or another, and if you've lived more than a day on the planet you certainly know a Del Griffith.  And Hughes has a way of bringing you into Neal and Del's world so that you are able to share their experience, while at the same time affording you the luxury of being able to observe it all at arm's length, which enables you to see the ""big picture"" and appreciate the inherent humor of it all.  And the bottom line is, this movie is a riot.  There's something of the spirit of Jack Lemmon's ""The Out-of-Towners"" about it, the whole idea of nature seemingly conspiring against the little guy, that keeps the laughs coming; and Hughes couldn't have had anyone better than Martin and Candy to put it across more successfully.Martin has an inspired way with physical comedy-- he can make walking down the street funny-- and he infuses it with a subtle, underlying sense that something is always going on inside him that's just as funny as what he's showing you.  It creates an air of anticipation, and he never fails to deliver on that promise.  Like Lemmon, he has the ability to play the ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation in a very real way, and then take it to the limit without going over the top.  And when the reserved, inner turmoil finally erupts, it has you laughing until your sides ache.  It's Lemmon standing in the middle of the street railing at the city of New York, and Martin confronting a rental car clerk and spelling it out for her in no uncertain terms what he thinks of her, her cars and life in general at that particular moment in time.  It's pure humor, and it works so well because there's absolutely nothing mean-spirited in the way it's delivered, which is something for which Martin-- and Lemmon before him-- deserves a nod of appreciation and acknowledgement; it's a fine art that few comic actors are, in fact, able to master.John Candy, meanwhile, puts his own natural abilities to the test in creating a character in Del that is the antithesis of Neal.  And he passes with flying colors.  Del is the big, lovable goof who wears his heart on his sleeve and holds nothing back.  With Del, what you see is what you get, and there's not a thought that goes through his mind, apparently, that he doesn't feel obliged to share with anyone and everyone who will listen.  Everything about Del is externalized to the point of being overwhelming, and yet Candy manages to convey the feeling that even he has something locked away that is for himself alone, and it's that which makes Del a well rounded character and makes him real.  Like Martin's, Candy's is a performance that is rich in detail and humanity, which makes Del believable, and a memorable character.  Candy was perfect for this part, one that he was seemingly born to play.  And he makes the most of it.The supporting cast includes Laila Robins (Susan), Michael McKean (State Trooper), Dylan Baker (Owen), Edie McClurg (Car Rental Agent) and Charles Tyner (Gus), with cameos by Kevin Bacon and William Windom.  More than just a funny movie, but one which exemplifies the ""human comedy,"" ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a triumph for Hughes, but more especially for his stars, Martin and Candy, who demonstrate a refined understanding of human nature and behavior through their respective characters that makes this film so endearing, memorable and entertaining.  This is one to watch again and again, whenever you're in need of a good laugh or just something to put a smile on your face.  This is one that will definitely fill the bill.  It's the magic of the movies.",4,Classic Martin and Candy,1007510400,"12 5, 2001",2001,5502,"[""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'spend', 'time', 'road', 'business', 'know', 'how', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'especially', 'holiday', 'Thanksgiving', 'family', 'waiting', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fire', 'fireplace', 'turkey', 'dinner', 'trimmings', 'have', 'do', 'get', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'Murphy', 'Law', 'concerning', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'often', 'play', 'simplest', 'things', 'become', 'obstacles', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'exactly', 'what', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'comedy', 'monumental', 'proportions', 'written', 'directed', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Neal', 'Page', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'New', 'York', 'business', 'two', 'days', 'Thanksgiving', 'plane', 'waiting', 'take', 'back', 'home', 'Chicago', 'reservation', 'not', 'far', 'go', 'holiday', 'weather', 'chancy', 'beginning', 'trouble', 'Neal', 'just', 'getting', 'cab', 'take', 'airport', 'become', 'mired', 'frustration', 'one', 'thing', 'attempts', 'get', 'home', 'Not', 'worry', 'however', 'once', 'plane', 'guy', 'named', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'John', 'Candy', 'showercurtain-ring', 'salesman', 'answers', 'connections', 'seemingly', 'city', 'country', 'handy', 'maybe', 'not', 'Neal', 'when', 'weather', 'Chicago', 'forces', 'closure', 'airport', 'flight', 'diverted', 'Wichita', 'Kansas', 'only', 'beginning', 'Neal', 'problems', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'job', 'guy', 'know', 'situation', 'not', 'next', 'couple', 'days', 'become', 'comedy', 'errors', 'Neal', 'edge', 'sanity', 'audience', 'edge', 'hilarity.An', 'astute', 'student', 'human', 'nature', 'John', 'Hughes', 'observations', 'insights', 'film', 'story', 'just', 'anyone', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'identify', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Neal', 'situation', 'one', 'time', 'one', 'way', ""'ve"", 'lived', 'more', 'day', 'planet', 'certainly', 'know', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'Hughes', 'way', 'bringing', 'Neal', 'Del', 'world', 'are', 'able', 'share', 'experience', 'same', 'time', 'affording', 'luxury', 'being', 'able', 'observe', 'arm', 'length', 'see', 'big', 'picture', 'appreciate', 'inherent', 'humor', 'bottom', 'line', 'movie', 'riot', 'something', 'spirit', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Out-of-Towners', 'whole', 'idea', 'nature', 'seemingly', 'conspiring', 'little', 'guy', 'laughs', 'coming', 'Hughes', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'anyone', 'better', 'Martin', 'Candy', 'put', 'more', 'successfully.Martin', 'inspired', 'way', 'physical', 'comedy', 'can', 'make', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'funny', 'subtle', 'underlying', 'sense', 'something', 'always', 'going', 'just', 'as', 'funny', 'what', 'showing', 'air', 'anticipation', 'never', 'deliver', 'promise', 'Lemmon', 'ability', 'play', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'very', 'real', 'way', 'then', 'take', 'limit', 'going', 'top', 'when', 'reserved', 'inner', 'turmoil', 'finally', 'laughing', 'sides', 'ache', 'Lemmon', 'standing', 'middle', 'street', 'railing', 'city', 'New', 'York', 'Martin', 'confronting', 'rental', 'car', 'clerk', 'spelling', 'out', 'uncertain', 'terms', 'what', 'cars', 'life', 'general', 'particular', 'moment', 'time', 'pure', 'humor', 'so', 'well', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'mean-spirited', 'way', 'delivered', 'something', 'Martin', 'Lemmon', 'nod', 'appreciation', 'acknowledgement', 'fine', 'art', 'few', 'comic', 'actors', 'are', 'fact', 'able', 'master.John', 'Candy', 'meanwhile', 'own', 'natural', 'abilities', 'test', 'creating', 'character', 'Del', 'antithesis', 'Neal', 'flying', 'colors', 'Del', 'big', 'lovable', 'goof', 'who', 'heart', 'sleeve', 'nothing', 'back', 'Del', 'what', 'see', 'what', 'get', 'not', 'thought', 'mind', 'apparently', ""n't"", 'feel', 'obliged', 'share', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'who', 'will', 'listen', 'Everything', 'Del', 'externalized', 'point', 'being', 'overwhelming', 'yet', 'Candy', 'convey', 'feeling', 'even', 'something', 'locked', 'away', 'alone', 'Del', 'well', 'rounded', 'character', 'real', 'Martin', 'Candy', 'performance', 'rich', 'detail', 'humanity', 'Del', 'believable', 'memorable', 'character', 'Candy', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'one', 'was', 'seemingly', 'born', 'play', 'most', 'it.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Laila', 'Robins', 'Susan', 'Michael', 'McKean', 'State', 'Trooper', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'Owen', 'Edie', 'McClurg', 'Car', 'Rental', 'Agent', 'Charles', 'Tyner', 'Gus', 'cameos', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'William', 'Windom', 'More', 'just', 'funny', 'movie', 'one', 'human', 'comedy', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'triumph', 'Hughes', 'more', 'especially', 'stars', 'Martin', 'Candy', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'refined', 'understanding', 'human', 'nature', 'behavior', 'respective', 'characters', 'film', 'so', 'endearing', 'memorable', 'entertaining', 'one', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'whenever', ""'re"", 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'just', 'something', 'put', 'smile', 'face', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'fill', 'bill', 'magic', 'movies']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

241905,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6300989003,Robert Badgley,"[1, 3]","Plains,Trains and Automobiles(released Nov/87)starring Steve Martin and John Candy,is one of the late John Hughe's biggest successes on the screen.It is also one of the late John Candy's best films.John Hughes had a great feel in the 80s for teen speak and angst with such films as Pretty in Pink,16 Candles and The Breakfast Club,which established the now famous brat pack to his audiences.But I don't believe his forte was in comedy per se.His ideas in that regard stemmed less from situations but more in your face and exaggerated sight gags;that is less subtlety,more outrageousness.However there is no denying the then box office appeal of this movie and his others such as from the National Lampoon series.This film involves the story of one Neal Page(Steve Martin) as a businessman who is anxious to leave NYC on a business there and get home to Chicago before Thanksgiving.He is hindered by a slow moving client(played wonderfully by William Windom-he also can be seen in the closing moments of the film,post credits)who stares and stares at Martin's presentation for what seems forever.When Page finally gets to leave he hails a cab and has a competing run down with Kevin Bacon(in a cameo role)and loses that.When he finally manages to get a cab it is surreptitiously scooped up by one Del Griffith(John Candy).It is not a good day so far and things are looking down from here for;three long days in fact.Page finally manages to get on his flight and who sits beside him,but Mr Griffith who is a non stop annoyance to Page.Page learns,among other things whether he likes it or not,Griffith is a shower curtain hook salesman who is also going home to his wife.Along the way the flight is diverted to Wichita,Kansas due to a storm and Page and Griffith end up together once again.Griffith offers to ""pull some strings"" and they land in a motel.Not only does Page get stuck with the cab fare but he has to foot the motel bill;one room,one queen size bed.The two get into heated discussions and finally get to sleep.That night a thief steals all of Pages money and in the morning the two are closerthanthis in bed.This DVD isn't called ""Those aren't pillows"" edition for no reason!The next day Griffith suggests taking the train to the Windy City but passenger trains don't run from Wichita,they go out of Stubbville.Del calls in another ""favour"" and the two get a ride there in the back of an open flat bed truck by a couple out of ""Deliverance"";freezing all the way.Once on the train and are home free,the train breaks down and they are forced to hike to a bus.On the bus Del suggests a sing a long.Page's suggestion doesn't register as well as Del's of The Flintstone theme.Page and Griffith finally arrive in St Louis where Page suggests they part.Page makes arrangements for a rental car at the airport and when he is dropped off in the huge rental lot(seemingly miles away from the airport and left there)his car is not to be found.Walking back to the airport he's in a foul mood when he confronts a startled clerk,but no car is forthcoming as he tossed away his rental agreement at the lot.Outside he gets shoved onto the pavement by a parking concierge and almost gets run over by....Griffith who magically is driving a rental car!The two agree to share the driving chores and Page takes the first watch as they speed back to Chicago.When its' Del's turn he falls asleep at the wheel,loses a cigarette in the back seat,ends up going the wrong way on the highway and while trying to take his coat off almost gets them killed.As they are standing outside the car retrieving Del's suitcase the cigarette finally causes the car to catch on fire and explode.Miraculously the now blackened hulk is still drivable and they manage to get to a motel.Page isn't speaking to Griffith but part way through the night he takes pity on a freezing Del sitting in the ""car"" and lets him inside.Through adversity the two have now somehow bonded but the next day the pair are pulled over on the highway for speeding.Why? The speedometer is burned out,and the car is then impounded because it is ridiculously unsafe.Griffith again manages to get transportation,this time in the back of a trailer truck...refrigerated of course.Once in Chicago Del and Neal part ways at the El.On the train Neal starts to think back on his last three days and suddenly decides to return to the station hoping to catch Del,or at least make the effort to.To his surprise Del is still there.It seems his wife died  nine years before and he hasn't any family left to go home to.Neal takes him home with him and introduces Del to his family as they all settle in for their Thanksgiving get together.The film was well crafted and moves along at a fair clip.The gags roll from one into another as Page's anger ebbs and flows depending on what foolishness Griffith manages to concoct.Candy manages to instill some real emotion into his characterization on the screen.Griffith may be seem like a pain in the butt ne'er do well who won't stop talking,but underneath it all he is hiding alot of pain which is the reason for the annoying outward impression.It's a ""don't judge a book by its cover"" moral but done smartly.Martin keeps his character from going too over the top which would have ruined the laughs the makers were trying for.He just stays within the boundaries and the two make a good team.Technically the DVD has been transferred well and is presented in its widescreen format.Extras include some featurettes:A Tribute to Candy,the making of the film and one on John Hughes himself.There is also a deleted scene included.If you like your gags on the in-your-face side,along the lines of the National Lampoon series,Porky's,et al,then you'll love this movie.It is one of Hughes best grossing films from the 80s and it will please all the fans of both Steve Martin and a man we lost all too soon,John Candy.",3,3 1/2 stars for this likable John Hughes flick.,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,5883,"['Plains',

If it weren't for one extended scene where the f-word is repeated about 20 times, it would be a great family movie.  If you can catch it on edited TV to watch with the kids, that might be better.  Of course we watched this with our 9 year old.  Oh well.  He's pretty much heard it all by now anyway.  Sad but true.  I probably wasn't any different in 4th grade.Well, the movie is a terrific slapstick comedy.  One of John Candy's best.  Bad weather keeps Ad Exec Steve Martin from getting home to his family for Thanksgiving.  He ends up getting stuck with sloppy, non-stop-talker, salesman John Candy for a road trip involving planes, trains, cars, trucks, semis, and walking to get back to Chicago.  There is one scene that I remember rolling around on the floor laughing when I saw it at the theater in 1988 (as I was a grad student and had no money, we were at the nearly empty second run dollar movie).  The boy did the same when we watched it last weekend.  Has a few slow parts, but the funny scenes easily make up for those.  A throw back to the Abbott and Costello/Crosby and Hope buddy movies and it is as fun and silly as those.  And it does end well.Hope you enjoy.",4,"Funny Movie.

I have seen the gags and this film many times and yet it retains the charm i've always loved about it.  Much cleaner than today's ""toilet humor"" films (which gross me no end, by the way but I digress), at the very least the former Saturday Night Live guys let us sneak a peak in the life of Steve's character, a introverted businessman who only has one passion: his wife and kids.  His frustration with the airport, with the taxi (surprise appearance by Kevin (the goblin) Bacon) and one thing after another that we travellers can relate to, at first he resents, hates, and then comes to admire (and somewhat smarmy sympathize) with Candy's character, a curtain ring salesman who, despite major losses in his life latches onto Steve and won't let him go.Of course the funniest scenes (the ""pillow"" incident and the f**king rental car girl) make it an R rating for the Thanksgiving dinner relatives who may drop by and want a sneak peak.Enjoyable, but definitely not for the whole family.Other John Candy favorites:John Candy: Comedy Favorites CollectionOnly the LonelyHome AloneLove Steve Martin films:All of MeSteve Martin - The Wild and Crazy Comedy Collection (Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid / The Jerk / The Lonely Guy)And don't forget Saturday Nite Live:Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live, as Told By Its Stars, Writers and GuestsBest of Saturday Night Live Classic Years Collection 1975 - 80 - Vol. 1",4,Trade this DVD for a CASIO!

241921,A1KVBBRXQ2PWJ7,6300989003,Siklootd,"[0, 0]","""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a truly unique, and hilarious viewing experience.  The entire film fuels the comedic needs of the audience by supplying enough variety in the punchlines and enough tension and build up to lead to truly hysterical moments rarely seen in films.  Prior to this film, Steve Martin already had a very established and recognizable name within the comedy genre of films with movies such as ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Man With Two Brains"" already under his belt.  The late, great, John Candy, a legend for the comedy world, also was entering this film riding the success of several past films, including ""Spaceballs"", ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".  The two actors truly shine in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" and their chemistry in the film is truly outstanding.The movie begins by showing Neal Page (Steve Martin) in a New York office, awaiting the final decision from his boss regarding a cover shot for an advertisement at the advertising company in which he works at.  With every passing second, Neal is becoming more and more frustrated, since he is already running late for his flight back to Chicago to meet his family for Thanksgiving weekend.  When he's finally free from his job, he begins his mad rush to the airport, having to fight the crowds of the crowded New York streets, and fight fellow civilians for the few free cabs that are roaming the streets.  Upon getting to a cab, just in time, he is forced to buy the cab from the man currently occupying it.  During their negotiations with one another, another man (John Candy) takes it upon himself to steal the cab and leave.Out of money that he used to pay for the cab that he didn't even get, Neal is more frustrated than before.  He arrives at the airport to find out that the man who stole his cab, Del Griffith (John Candy) is going to be on the same flight as him.  Neal's luck gets worse, since he ends up sitting next to Del on the flight, leaving him to put up with Del's constant talking throughout the trip.  Their flight touches down in Wichita, and cannot fly to Chicago until the snow blizzard there clears up, leaving Neal stranded at the airport.  He agrees to stay with Del at a local hotel, a decision he later regrets.The rest of the film focuses around the bad luck that the two men face trying to get back to Chicago.  From a train breaking down on the tracks, to not being able to find a rental car, driving the wrong way on the interstate, and blowing up a car, Neal and Del go through the worst case scenarios in some of the worst circumstances a traveler could possibly face.  Despite their constant fighting, and blaming of one another for the misfortunes they are experiencing, Neal and Del eventually bond and realize that in order to get to Chicago, the two men must put their differences aside and work with one another no matter what.The film features many hilarious scenes, including the hotel scene where Steve Martin and John Candy awake from an awkward spooning session.  Steve Martin's reaction to the rent-a-car employee is sure to provide some laughs, and the entire highway scene is one of the stand out scenes of the entire film.  The deleted scene that focuses around the flight on the airplane is worth checking out, and adds its own spark of hilarity to the film.""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" is a film that will please fans of classic comedy movies, and fans of the comedy genre in general.  Anyone who enjoys either Steve Martin or John Candy is doing themselves a huge injustice by not viewing this film.  The interaction between the two actors is what truly makes this film enjoyable, and it still stands to this day as one of the greatest films that either man was ever in.",5,What Could Possibly Go Wrong?,1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,3748,"['Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'truly', 'unique', 'hilarious', 'viewing', 'experience', 'entire', 'film', 'fuels', 'comedic', 'needs', 'audience', 'supplying', 'enough', 'variety', 'punchlines', 'enough', 'tension', 'build', 'up', 'lead', 'truly', 'hysterical', 'moments', 'rarely', 'seen', 'films', 'Prior', 'film', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'already', 'had', 'very', 'established', 'recognizable', 'name', 'comedy', 'genre', 'films', 'movies', 'such', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'Man', 'Two', 'Brains', 'already', 'belt', 'late', 'great', 'John', 'Candy', 'legend', 'comedy', 'world', 'also', 'was', 'entering', 'film', 'riding', 'success', 'several', 'past', 'films', 'including', 'Spaceballs', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'two', 'actors', 'truly', 'shine', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'chemistry', 'film', 'truly', 'outstanding.The', 'movie', 'begins', 'showing', 'Neal', 'Page', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'New', 'York', 'office', 'awaiting', 'final', 'decision', 'boss', 'regarding', 'cover', 'shot', 'advertisement', 'advertising', 'company', 'passing', 'second', 'Neal', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'frustrated', 'already', 'running', 'late', 'flight', 'back', 'Chicago', 'meet', 'family', 'Thanksgiving', 'weekend', 'When', 'finally', 'free', 'job', 'mad', 'rush', 'airport', 'having', 'fight', 'crowds', 'crowded', 'New', 'York', 'streets', 'fight', 'fellow', 'civilians', 'few', 'free', 'cabs', 'are', 'roaming', 'streets', 'getting', 'cab', 'just', 'time', 'forced', 'buy', 'cab', 'man', 'currently', 'occupying', 'negotiations', 'one', 'man', 'John', 'Candy', 'steal', 'cab', 'leave.Out', 'money', 'used', 'pay', 'cab', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Neal', 'more', 'frustrated', 'before', 'airport', 'find', 'out', 'man', 'who', 'stole', 'cab', 'Del', 'Griffith', 'John', 'Candy', 'going', 'be', 'same', 'flight', 'Neal', 'luck', 'worse', 'up', 'sitting', 'next', 'Del', 'flight', 'leaving', 'put', 'up', 'Del', 'constant', 'talking', 'trip', 'flight', 'touches', 'down', 'Wichita', 'can', 'not', 'fly', 'Chicago', 'snow', 'blizzard', 'up', 'leaving', 'Neal', 'stranded', 'airport', 'stay', 'Del', 'local', 'hotel', 'decision', 'later', 'regrets.The', 'rest', 'film', 'bad', 'luck', 'two', 'men', 'face', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'Chicago', 'train', 'breaking', 'down', 'tracks', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'rental', 'car', 'driving', 'wrong', 'way', 'interstate', 'blowing', 'up', 'car', 'Neal', 'Del', 'go', 'worst', 'case', 'scenarios', 'worst', 'circumstances', 'traveler', 'could', 'possibly', 'face', 'constant', 'fighting', 'blaming', 'one', 'misfortunes', 'are', 'experiencing', 'Neal', 'Del', 'eventually', 'bond', 'realize', 'order', 'get', 'Chicago', 'two', 'men', 'must', 'put', 'differences', 'aside', 'work', 'one', 'matter', 'what.The', 'film', 'features', 'many', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'including', 'hotel', 'scene', 'where', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'John', 'Candy', 'awake', 'awkward', 'spooning', 'session', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'reaction', 'rent-a-car', 'employee', 'sure', 'provide', 'laughs', 'entire', 'highway', 'scene', 'one', 'stand', 'scenes', 'entire', 'film', 'deleted', 'scene', 'flight', 'airplane', 'checking', 'out', 'own', 'spark', 'hilarity', 'film', 'Planes', 'Trains', 'Automobiles', 'film', 'will', 'please', 'fans', 'classic', 'comedy', 'movies', 'fans', 'comedy', 'genre', 'general', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'John', 'Candy', 'doing', 'huge', 'injustice', 'not', 'viewing', 'film', 'interaction', 'two', 'actors', 'what', 'truly', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'still', 'day', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'man', 'was', 'ever']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

All films are subjective, but this is much better than their reviewer makes out IMO. Its consistently funny, with Steve Martin delivering one of his best performances. Indeed without Martin it would have been merely an average film. He takes it to another level. This is not to say that John Candy is bad, he isn't, but Steve Martin is the reason to see the film.Essentially its a string of comedic set pieces, the train, the Motel, the car etc. Each of these have great moments, perhaps none better than the Motel where they find they have to share a bed. Theres also a lovely joke in the back of a flat bed truck with a dog in very cold weather.My only criticism is the 80's music, which to fair I didn't like in the 80's! This has dated badly now. I also have mixed feelings about the ending as well. A little bit too soppy for my liking.Overall though a fine movie with excellent performances, many laugh out loud moments, and a film that you can watch many times without being bored by it (mainly because of Steve Martin).",4,High class movie,1212451200,"06 3, 2008",2008,1112,"['other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'Amazon', 'review', 'film', 'best', 'misleading', 'films', 'are', 'subjective', 'much', 'better', 'reviewer', 'out', 'IMO', 'consistently', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'delivering', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Indeed', 'Martin', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'merely', 'average', 'film', 'level', 'not', 'say', 'John', 'Candy', 'bad', ""n't"", 'Steve', 'Martin', 'reason', 'see', 'film.Essentially', 'string', 'comedic', 'set', 'pieces', 'train', 'Motel', 'car', 'etc', 'have', 'great', 'moments', 'perhaps', 'none', 'better', 'Motel', 'where', 'find', 'have', 'share', 'bed', 'also', 'lovely', 'joke', 'back', 'flat', 'bed', 'truck', 'dog', 'very', 'cold', 'weather.My', 'only', 'criticism', '80', 'music', 'fair', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', '80', 'dated', 'badly', 'now', 'also', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'ending', 'as', 'well', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'soppy', 'liking.Overall', 'fine', 'movie', 'excellent', 'performances', 'many', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'film', 'can', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'being', 'bored', 'mainly', 'Steve', 'Martin']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

Last night, I watched another movie that wanted to be a comedy but wasn't, and that was Baseketball. This movie got a R rated rating, and the only reason I know of is lanuage. Paramount made and relased this movie. John Candy that went to do Uncle Buck, Home Alone, The Great Outdoors, Rookie of the Year, and Wagon's East before dying of a heart attack in 1994. As the movie opens, a marking consultant (Steve Martin) is in a rush to catch a plane to Chicago from New York for Thanksgiving. He gets to the airport in time to find out the plane has been delayed, so after waiting a couple of hours, he boards a plane but finds that instead of flying first class, he winds up in coach, and has a seat to a man (John Candy) that is also heading to Chicago, but instead the plane makes s detour to Wichita. Both Martin and Candy both spend a night in an inn where they are end up in room together only to discover in the morning, they have been robbed.",4,"Aaron, I can answer your question",1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,1072,"['movie', 'not', 'funny', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'John', 'Candy', 'not', 'funny', 'movie', 'can', 'say', 'comedy', 'wannabe', 'Last', 'night', 'watched', 'movie', 'wanted', 'be', 'comedy', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'Baseketball', 'movie', 'got', 'R', 'rated', 'rating', 'only', 'reason', 'know', 'lanuage', 'Paramount', 'made', 'relased', 'movie', 'John', 'Candy', 'went', 'do', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Great', 'Outdoors', 'Rookie', 'Year', 'Wagon', 'East', 'dying', 'heart', 'attack', '1994', 'movie', 'marking', 'consultant', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'rush', 'catch', 'plane', 'Chicago', 'New', 'York', 'Thanksgiving', 'airport', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'plane', 'been', 'delayed', 'so', 'waiting', 'couple', 'hours', 'plane', 'instead', 'flying', 'first', 'class', 'up', 'coach', 'seat', 'man', 'John', 'Candy', 'also', 'heading', 'Chicago', 'instead', 'plane', 's', 'detour', 'Wichita', 'Martin', 'Candy', 'spend', 'night', 'inn', 'where', 'are', 'end', 'up', 'room', 'together', 'only', 'discover', 'morning', 'have', 'been', 'robbed']","Planes, Trains And Automobiles VHS"

241955,A39UKBJJXJ82FO,6300989003,Tristan,"[2, 2]","Steve Martin plays Neil Page, a tightly wound, stressed out, overworked, and frustrated businessman who wants nothing more than to return to his loving family for Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, nature, vehicles, and all of the people around him seem to be working against him. Everything that could possibly go wrong goes wrong, and his trip turns into a disaster plagued journey full of misfortune. To make matters worse, he continues to run into an overly cheerful, overly talkative, and overly optimistic salesman named Del Griffith (played by John Candy) who does his mood no favors and who ends up slowly turning his stressful trip into a living nightmare.I know that this film is considered by many to be the most mature film by John Hughes, god rest his soul. I will admit that I find the films of John Hughes to be overrated. Sure, I enjoyed Uncle Buck quite a bit, and I can at least appreciate what Sixteen Candles and Ferris Bueller's Day Off says about teen culture in the 1980s. However, I can't say that I really got all that involved in what was going on in them. Maybe it's because I'm not an 80s kid. Maybe I just can't get involved in films that feature that kind of look and atmosphere. I consider The Breakfast Club to be a brilliant film in a lot of ways, but other than that there isn't too much I'm impressed with in terms of his directorial body of work. If you want to talk about the films he's produced, such as Dennis the Menace, Home Alone 3, and Just Visiting, well, that's another story altogether. Despite all of this, however, I'm just going to go ahead and say that I think Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is perhaps the greatest comedy ever made. It is a film filled with remarkable honesty, serious destruction, bizarre poignancy, and tremendous depth. It is a film that dares to step outside the comfort level of comedy, several times, and still has the strength and the integrity to remain consistently fresh and startling. This is a film that demonstrates, above all, the need for human companionship, the unspoken bond between strangers, and the unselfish desires in all of us. This is a film that is not only filled with big big BIG laughs, but also full of terrible heartbreak. The heartbreak in this film, however, does not come out of tragedy. The heartbreak comes out of the underlying fear of being alone, or worse yet, angering someone you really care about. Above all, however, this is just a really good Thanksgiving film.One of the most powerful things about the film is John Candy, whose character is beautiful in a lot of ways not necessarily noticeable. He may be crude, naive, loud, and he may take up too much space almost all the time, but his intentions are incredibly pure and his selflessness is pretty damn infectious. The difference, however, between this loudmouth and any other loudmouth in a typical comedy is that Del Griffith is not stupid. He knows early on in the film that he annoys Neil. However, he does not let this change the way he feels toward Neil Page and, while his feelings are obviously hurt when he learns this, he takes this advantage to learn more about this man so that he can help him. Sure, he may do more harm than good much of the time, but that never changes the fact that he still has his best interests in mind. This buddy comedy is different in that both of the buddies have real feelings.I think that it is safe to say that this is one of Steve Martin's most subtle roles as he is normally more into the physical comedy than the situational. However, this character who he plays who is a complete jerk is also never unsympathetic. Hughes manages to do this by editing scenes of his family at home eagerly awaiting his arrival. As a result of this, Hughes manages to create some rather unusual suspense for a comedy picture, and this helps bring a more emotional undercurrent to the picture that I found and still find very refreshing. What really blows this film out of the water, however, is the final act of the film in which the comedy and the heartbreak is upped by about ten times as much. We not only see Steve Martin at his most realistically maniacal, but we also are rewarded with a conclusion that is so brilliant, so shocking, so human, and so sad that I dare not give it away. I warn you, however, make sure that you have a box of tissues beside you when you watch this because if you have a big heart you will cry at the end of this film and you will cry hard. This is the kind of film that really makes you fee thankful for your family, your friends, and your loved ones. I think that, to me, that's what makes it such a powerful film.This film has always meant a lot to me, even as a child, and I think that it's one of the best family films in existence. What makes it work especially, however, is it's universal emotion. These characters are so mismatched and so dysfunctional that we feel almost privileged to go on this bizarre journey with them. Few films make me feel this way. If there are any real complaints to have about the film, I suppose that it'd be the soundtrack. While I personally have no problems with it, I have noticed that many critics do. The thing is, it's typical 80s synth pop music. While I can't say that I'm a fan, I personally didn't feel that it took anything away from the film whatsoever. I know that John Hughes loves using 80s music, so if you're seriously complaining about an 80s synch pop soundtrack in a John Hughes film then you may as well make that same complaint for all of his films. The thing is, this is the kind of film that doesn't need a special or good sounding soundtrack to work. All it needs is music that fits the tone for the appropriate scene, and the music in this does just that. So really, complaining about the soundtrack here is a stretch in itself. Above all, this is just a terrific film. It is a film that makes me miss John Candy more than I already do, but even moreso it's just a great film with an exhilarating emotional theme that makes the humor seem all the more real. This is one of the most emotional comedies I've seen, and overall it's just one of the greatest films ever made.(to read more reviews like this one, go to:[...])",5,One of the best and funniest films

The twist is that he teams up with a complete stranger in their quest to get to where they need to be. It's in this vain that the unfortunate but often hilarious events take place. The comedy in this film runs from a chuckle to side-splitting laughter. Things are often taken to the extremes, but in an odd way, it all seems logical.The story is heart-touching in the end. Again, there's nothing complicated about the ending or how the film gets there. In all honesty -- ""you're along for the ride"".
