Ewan McGregor,overworks his Southern accent, and goes through the enitre film on one note. He was alright, but, for me, he tried a little too hard to be charming.Jessica Lange is a great actress, but she's pretty wasted here as Finney's wife. Billy Crudup, as Finney's son was, again, solid, but somewhat annoying.I also thought the ensemble cast had very little chemistry-it almost felt like Burton placed a bunch of strangers into one house.I also thought that Big Fish got a little too sentimental towards the end-begging for emotion that had not been warranted throughout the film.And the voice overs by Billy Crudup just did it for me-they were TOTALLY pointless and just seemed to squander whatever pleasure I got from watching the film. I know what was going on during the film; I know what you did pal, and what you must've learned-I do NOT need you to tell me.All in all, while this is a film which did not do anything for me on the emotional front, I liked its quirkiness, and Albert Finney's performance.I thought it moved along nicely, and kept me entertained.But, your enjoynment of the film will really depend how much of a sucker you are for great scenery, and if you're like me, (and I go weak in the knees from sweet eye candy)you'll be able to enoy Big Fish that much more.",3,"Entertaining, but emotionally stiff",1087084800,"06 13, 2004",2004,1895,"['Big', 'Fish', 'pretty', 'fun', 'movie.It', 'entertaining', 'visually', 'delightful', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'top', 'form', 'enough', 'quirky', 'characters', 'satisfy', 'eccentric', 'viewer.But', 'enjoyed', 'overall', 'experience', 'watching', 'Big', 'Fish', 'never', 'really', 'related', 'characters', 'felt', 'emotionally', 'moved', 'involved', 'it.And', 'acting', 'being', 'solid', 'pretty', 'much', 'everybody', 'think', 'was', ""n't"", 'Albert', 'Finney', 'wry', 'dry', 'touching', 'performance', 'older', 'father', 'Big', 'Fish', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'succeeded', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'basis', 'quirky', 'characters', 'great', 'eye', 'candy', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Southern', 'accent', 'enitre', 'film', 'one', 'note', 'was', 'alright', 'tried', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'charming.Jessica', 'Lange', 'great', 'actress', 'pretty', 'wasted', 'here', 'Finney', 'wife', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Finney', 'son', 'was', 'again', 'solid', 'somewhat', 'also', 'thought', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'chemistry-it', 'almost', 'felt', 'Burton', 'placed', 'bunch', 'strangers', 'one', 'house.I', 'also', 'thought', 'Big', 'Fish', 'got', 'little', 'too', 'sentimental', 'end-begging', 'emotion', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'warranted', 'film.And', 'voice', 'overs', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'just', 'did', 'me-they', 'were', 'TOTALLY', 'pointless', 'just', 'seemed', 'squander', 'pleasure', 'got', 'watching', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'know', 'what', 'did', 'pal', 'what', 'must', ""'ve"", 'learned-I', 'do', 'NOT', 'need', 'tell', 'me.All', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'anything', 'emotional', 'front', 'liked', 'quirkiness', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'performance.I', 'thought', 'moved', 'along', 'nicely', 'kept', 'entertained.But', 'enjoynment', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'depend', 'how', 'much', 'sucker', 'are', 'great', 'scenery', ""'re"", 'go', 'weak', 'knees', 'sweet', 'eye', 'candy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'enoy', 'Big', 'Fish', 'much', 'more']",N/A
804530,A20LY8E9NGYA4M,B0001GOH6Q,Alejandro Cortes,"[1, 3]","Tim Burton, one of the finest active directors, returns with another great movie, ""Big Fish"". The film is narrated in a very interesting way, it is divided in episodes, some of them show the current time, and some of them show the past of the characters. We are witnesses of the fantastic and supernatural adventures that Edward (the main character) lived in his youth.The young Edward, played by the charismatic Ewan McGregor, goes through the funniest situations, he meets a lovable giant, he goes through an enchanted forest, he arrives to a wacky town where everybody threw their shoes to the electric wires, he works in a circus packed with freaks, he meets a poet that has written only three lines in the past 12 years, he goes to the war and he meets the love of his live. And those are only half of his adventures.The cast of ""Big Fish"" is excellent, it's a combination between veteran actors (Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny De Vito), remarkable actors (Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi), and young talent (Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup).The technical aspect in ""Big Fish"" is another highlight of the film, the locations are very colorful, the visual effects aren't as pretentious and overwhelming as in other movies, but they are simple, realistic and effective and get the job done. The makeup and the costumes are also excellent. Finally, the music is outstanding, it combines classic tunes with the original score, written by Danny Elfman.It's a huge mystery why this film was so underrated and ignored by the Academy, it is much better than ""Seabiscuit"", for example. Anyway, ""Big Fish"" has it all: fantasy, drama, comedy, adventures, sad moments, tender moments, unforgettable characters, interesting situations, an all-star cast, in few words this is a little gem.The audio and picture in this DVD are crystal clear, and the DVD extras are amusing and informative, there are not too many extras, but there are really good. However, the DVD does include a valuable audio commentary, courtesy of Tim Burton. So if you like fantasy films, this is a very good one, ""Big Fish"" is a great addition to any DVD collection.",4,TIM BURTON MADE ANOTHER FANTASTIC AND DELIGHTFUL MOVIE,1110931200,"03 16, 2005",2005,2150,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'one', 'finest', 'active', 'directors', 'returns', 'great', 'movie', 'Big', 'Fish', 'film', 'narrated', 'very', 'interesting', 'way', 'divided', 'episodes', 'show', 'current', 'time', 'show', 'past', 'characters', 'are', 'witnesses', 'fantastic', 'supernatural', 'adventures', 'Edward', 'main', 'character', 'lived', 'youth.The', 'young', 'Edward', 'played', 'charismatic', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'funniest', 'situations', 'lovable', 'giant', 'enchanted', 'forest', 'wacky', 'town', 'where', 'everybody', 'threw', 'shoes', 'electric', 'wires', 'circus', 'packed', 'freaks', 'poet', 'written', 'only', 'three', 'lines', 'past', '12', 'years', 'war', 'love', 'live', 'are', 'only', 'half', 'adventures.The', 'cast', 'Big', 'Fish', 'excellent', 'combination', 'veteran', 'actors', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'remarkable', 'actors', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'young', 'talent', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Billy', 'Crudup', '.The', 'technical', 'aspect', 'Big', 'Fish', 'highlight', 'film', 'locations', 'are', 'very', 'colorful', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'pretentious', 'overwhelming', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'simple', 'realistic', 'effective', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'makeup', 'costumes', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Finally', 'music', 'outstanding', 'classic', 'tunes', 'original', 'score', 'written', 'Danny', 'Elfman.It', 'huge', 'mystery', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'underrated', 'ignored', 'Academy', 'much', 'better', 'Seabiscuit', 'example', 'Anyway', 'Big', 'Fish', 'fantasy', 'drama', 'comedy', 'adventures', 'sad', 'moments', 'tender', 'moments', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'interesting', 'situations', 'all-star', 'cast', 'few', 'words', 'little', 'gem.The', 'audio', 'picture', 'DVD', 'are', 'crystal', 'clear', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'amusing', 'informative', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'many', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'However', 'DVD', 'include', 'valuable', 'audio', 'commentary', 'courtesy', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'So', 'like', 'fantasy', 'films', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Big', 'Fish', 'great', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

Burton's quirky signature is ever prevalent here, in this often lavish and wonderfully ridiculous story which raises a few smiles, and leaves the viewer with a warm (if confused) feeling at times.The main thrust of the script is how the initial ""Fish Stories"" relayed by the aging man to his son ultimately come to teach him the real truth about the life of the man he has regrettably not known, and the end result is a very entertaining movie for the whole family, or singular audience.",4,Burton at His Best,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,1031,"['Starring', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'offbeat', 'story', 'estranged', 'son', 'who', 'home', 'visit', 'dying', 'father', 'more', 'piecing', 'together', 'stories', 'gathered', 'years', 'typical', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'offbeat', 'colorful', 'way', 'McGregor', 'playing', 'father', 'younger', 'man', 'flashback', 'son', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 're-creating', 'father', 'elusive', 'life', 'series', 'legends', 'myths', 'inspired', 'few', 'facts', 'result', 'often', 'funny', 'also', 'beautifully', 'poignant', 'Burton', 'quirky', 'signature', 'ever', 'prevalent', 'here', 'often', 'lavish', 'wonderfully', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'few', 'smiles', 'viewer', 'warm', 'confused', 'feeling', 'times.The', 'main', 'thrust', 'script', 'how', 'initial', 'Fish', 'Stories', 'relayed', 'aging', 'man', 'son', 'ultimately', 'come', 'teach', 'real', 'truth', 'life', 'man', 'regrettably', 'not', 'known', 'end', 'result', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'singular', 'audience']",N/A
804538,A928WN8NV03WZ,B0001GOH6Q,"A. M Robertson ""brother_entropy""","[2, 3]","I was worried when this movie was out.  Though for many years he was known as the director with the midas touch, his two most recent films(Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow), were neither the commercial success that was predicted, nor pleasing to his fans.  This was all changed with Big Fish, a harkening back to the style that made him famous.The movie is based off the relationship between a father(Ed Bloom: Ewan MaCgregor and Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The relationship is a strange one, Will has little knowlege of who his father is, his father is given to telling tall tales.  He has done this all his life, and seems to revel in being the center of attention.  But his son tires of it and after an arguement they break contact.  Until his mother calls telling him that his father is dying, and she thinks he should come home.Ed Bloom then starts to tell his various life stories to his sons wife.  They are all tall tales, and distinctly American in flavor.  They range from a witch in the swamp that had a glass eye that you can see the time and manner of your death, to strange town in the boonies called Specter(you never leave because it is so perfect.  These stories are done in the tall tale fashion, Ed Bloom always seems to have the answer and always comes off as charasmatic and virtuous.  Ewan MacGregor always seems to have a grin on his face.  But they all have the traditional Burton style of warped humor.This is a much mellower and more family based than some of his movies, ie the dark fairy tale ""Edward Scissorhands"" or insane BettleGuise.  Some of the stories still have that edge, ie the poor man living in the shadow of Bloom all his life and eventually has his woman stolen from him by Bloom, or the chinese singers who are also siamese twins.  But the stories are usually upbeat and have a positive nature to them.  His character is also made up to be the archtypical American Hero for that era.  He is a sports star, good looking, charasmatic, brave, earned his own way, and served in the war receiving honors returning to his wife after it was all over.The acting was good all around, and well cast.  Ewan McGregor played his role excellently with the wide smile and thick sounthern accent.  Helen Carter has two small but memorable roles and the girl who had a crush on Bloom and the witch.  Danny Devito looks like he is having too much fun as the circus manager Amos Callaway.The movie was surreal as any of Tim Burtons movies are, but he didn't let it cut into the movies emotional content.  Which was the connection that the father had with his son and wife.  Many consider this movie a tear jerker towards the end.  Making this a great movie for a broad audience, families, couples, or fanatics of Burton's cinematic vision.",5,Burton is back,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",2004,2784,"['was', 'worried', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'out', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'known', 'director', 'midas', 'touch', 'two', 'most', 'recent', 'films', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'were', 'neither', 'commercial', 'success', 'was', 'predicted', 'pleasing', 'fans', 'was', 'changed', 'Big', 'Fish', 'harkening', 'back', 'style', 'made', 'famous.The', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'relationship', 'father', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Ewan', 'MaCgregor', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'relationship', 'strange', 'one', 'Will', 'little', 'knowlege', 'who', 'father', 'father', 'given', 'telling', 'tall', 'tales', 'done', 'life', 'revel', 'being', 'center', 'attention', 'son', 'tires', 'arguement', 'break', 'contact', 'mother', 'telling', 'father', 'dying', 'should', 'come', 'home.Ed', 'Bloom', 'then', 'tell', 'various', 'life', 'stories', 'sons', 'wife', 'are', 'tall', 'tales', 'distinctly', 'American', 'flavor', 'range', 'witch', 'swamp', 'had', 'glass', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'time', 'manner', 'death', 'strange', 'town', 'boonies', 'called', 'Specter', 'never', 'leave', 'so', 'perfect', 'stories', 'are', 'done', 'tall', 'tale', 'fashion', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'always', 'have', 'answer', 'always', 'off', 'charasmatic', 'virtuous', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'always', 'have', 'grin', 'face', 'have', 'traditional', 'Burton', 'style', 'warped', 'humor.This', 'much', 'mellower', 'more', 'family', 'based', 'movies', 'ie', 'dark', 'fairy', 'tale', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'insane', 'BettleGuise', 'stories', 'still', 'have', 'edge', 'ie', 'poor', 'man', 'living', 'shadow', 'Bloom', 'life', 'eventually', 'woman', 'stolen', 'Bloom', 'chinese', 'singers', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'siamese', 'twins', 'stories', 'are', 'usually', 'upbeat', 'have', 'positive', 'nature', 'character', 'also', 'made', 'up', 'be', 'archtypical', 'American', 'Hero', 'era', 'sports', 'star', 'good', 'looking', 'charasmatic', 'brave', 'earned', 'own', 'way', 'served', 'war', 'receiving', 'honors', 'returning', 'wife', 'was', 'over.The', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'well', 'cast', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'played', 'role', 'excellently', 'wide', 'smile', 'thick', 'sounthern', 'accent', 'Helen', 'Carter', 'two', 'small', 'memorable', 'roles', 'girl', 'who', 'had', 'crush', 'Bloom', 'witch', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'having', 'too', 'much', 'fun', 'circus', 'manager', 'Amos', 'Callaway.The', 'movie', 'was', 'surreal', 'Tim', 'Burtons', 'movies', 'are', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'cut', 'movies', 'emotional', 'content', 'was', 'connection', 'father', 'had', 'son', 'wife', 'Many', 'consider', 'movie', 'tear', 'jerker', 'end', 'Making', 'great', 'movie', 'broad', 'audience', 'families', 'couples', 'fanatics', 'Burton', 'cinematic', 'vision']",N/A

804540,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001GOH6Q,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","There is something extremely entertaining about Tim Burton's `Big Fish'; a mature fairy tale about a young man trying to understand the man his father truly is.  Burton has a way of taking what could easily become syrupy or saccharine and turning it into something sweet yet honest; never overplaying his hand so-to-speak.  `Big Fish' follows that formula, delivering to the audience an overload of mystical creatures and faraway lands and beautiful imagery wrapped up in a tender story about a father and son yet it never once comes across immature or childish.This is a plus and a minus in this case, but I'll get to that in a minute.The film revolves around Will and Ed Bloom.  Will has never really understood his father; in fact he appears to have a deep seeded contempt for him and the fact that he feels he was never allowed to get to know him.  This is because of all the `tall tales' Ed proceeded to tell Will his whole life.  When Will hears that his father is on his deathbed he travels home, hoping to finally hear some truth regarding his fathers life.What he gets is...Like I mentioned, `Big Fish' is visually beautiful to witness.  The sets and the costumes and the vivid use of colors are classic Burton all the way and manage to draw the audience into the fanciful world.  The stories told are all cohesive and fun to entertain.  This has a lot to do (or should I say everything to do) with the script, adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel.  Watching the stories unfold we can see clearly their truths amidst all the colorful exaggerations and this adds to the beauty of the story `outside' the stories that is unfolding between Ed and his son.The performances by the entire cast are wonderful as well, especially that of the two Ed's, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor.  Albert Finney is truly one of our finest actors that ever has graced the big screen (his relentless Oscar losses are crimes against humanity) and he brings so much of his natural charm to this performance you can't help but adore it.  Ewan McGregor likewise captures the fire still burning in Finney's eyes and exemplifies it as the younger, fantasy version of Ed Bloom.  I adore McGregor as an actor and feel he has a wealth of talent under his belt.  In `Big Fish' he is as magnetic as usual and delivers a top notch performance.  Jessica Lange is marvelous and touching as Sandra, Ed's wife, and Billy Crudup manages to make Will believable and relatable.  Recent Oscar Winner Marion Cotillard does a fine job with what little she is given and makes a lasting impression; albeit because she is stunning and possesses such unforgettable beauty.The immense cast of `fantasy' characters are all brought to life vividly as well thanks to strong performances by everyone from Helena Bonham Carter to Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi.  Alison Lohman does a fine job as the younger Sandra as well.In the end `Big Fish' is highly entertaining.  It is a fantasy tale that the whole family can enjoy and it manages to teach a beautiful lesson about family relationships.  This is also where that whole `anti-saccharine' element can be a minus.  What is great about `Big Fish' is that it feels honest and `adult' throughout, yet what I miss is that uncontrollable emotional connection that is supposed to overwhelm the viewer as the film draws to a climax.  If Burton had only kicked up the `syrup' for the ending, then I could feel this film was perfect.  There is a balance needed when doing anything, and while one does not want a film that is one big mushy mess we should never underestimate the value of some well positioned waterworks.",4,Sometimes tall tales can produce big rewards...,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,3617,"['something', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Big', 'Fish', 'mature', 'fairy', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'trying', 'understand', 'man', 'father', 'truly', 'Burton', 'way', 'taking', 'what', 'could', 'easily', 'become', 'syrupy', 'saccharine', 'turning', 'something', 'sweet', 'yet', 'honest', 'never', 'overplaying', 'hand', 'so-to-speak', 'Big', 'Fish', 'formula', 'delivering', 'audience', 'overload', 'mystical', 'creatures', 'faraway', 'lands', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'wrapped', 'up', 'tender', 'story', 'father', 'son', 'yet', 'never', 'once', 'immature', 'childish.This', 'plus', 'minus', 'case', ""'ll"", 'get', 'minute.The', 'film', 'around', 'Will', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Will', 'never', 'really', 'understood', 'father', 'fact', 'have', 'deep', 'seeded', 'contempt', 'fact', 'was', 'never', 'allowed', 'get', 'know', 'tall', 'tales', 'Ed', 'proceeded', 'tell', 'Will', 'whole', 'life', 'When', 'Will', 'father', 'deathbed', 'home', 'hoping', 'finally', 'hear', 'truth', 'regarding', 'fathers', 'mentioned', 'Big', 'Fish', 'visually', 'beautiful', 'witness', 'sets', 'costumes', 'vivid', 'use', 'colors', 'are', 'classic', 'Burton', 'way', 'manage', 'draw', 'audience', 'fanciful', 'world', 'stories', 'told', 'are', 'cohesive', 'fun', 'entertain', 'lot', 'do', 'should', 'say', 'everything', 'do', 'script', 'adapted', 'Daniel', 'Wallace', 'novel', 'Watching', 'stories', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'truths', 'colorful', 'exaggerations', 'beauty', 'story', 'stories', 'unfolding', 'Ed', 'son.The', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'are', 'wonderful', 'well', 'especially', 'two', 'Ed', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'truly', 'one', 'finest', 'actors', 'ever', 'graced', 'big', 'screen', 'relentless', 'Oscar', 'losses', 'are', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'so', 'much', 'natural', 'charm', 'performance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'adore', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'likewise', 'fire', 'still', 'burning', 'Finney', 'eyes', 'exemplifies', 'younger', 'fantasy', 'version', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'adore', 'McGregor', 'actor', 'feel', 'wealth', 'talent', 'belt', 'Big', 'Fish', 'as', 'magnetic', 'usual', 'top', 'notch', 'performance', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'marvelous', 'touching', 'Sandra', 'Ed', 'wife', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'make', 'Will', 'believable', 'relatable', 'Recent', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'fine', 'job', 'what', 'little', 'given', 'lasting', 'impression', 'stunning', 'possesses', 'such', 'unforgettable', 'beauty.The', 'immense', 'cast', 'fantasy', 'characters', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'vividly', 'as', 'well', 'thanks', 'strong', 'performances', 'everyone', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'fine', 'job', 'younger', 'Sandra', 'well.In', 'end', 'Big', 'Fish', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'teach', 'beautiful', 'lesson', 'family', 'relationships', 'also', 'where', 'whole', 'anti-saccharine', 'element', 'can', 'be', 'minus', 'What', 'great', 'Big', 'Fish', 'honest', 'adult', 'what', 'miss', 'uncontrollable', 'emotional', 'connection', 'supposed', 'overwhelm', 'viewer', 'film', 'climax', 'Burton', 'had', 'only', 'kicked', 'up', 'syrup', 'ending', 'then', 'could', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'perfect', 'balance', 'needed', 'when', 'doing', 'anything', 'one', 'not', 'want', 'film', 'one', 'big', 'mushy', 'mess', 'should', 'never', 'underestimate', 'value', 'well', 'positioned', 'waterworks']",N/A

By contrast, Alison Lohman becoming Jessica Lange was a lot more believable...unfortunately, that connection is not as tantamount to the core story.Do you want to see a movie where the young-to-old transition works at a fascinating level?  Check out the 2001 release ""Iris"" where young John Bayley - as played by Hugh Bonneville - morphs into the eldery version played by Jim Broadbent.

804543,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B0001GOH6Q,Antonio Robert,"[2, 3]","Deliberately more understated than many Hollywood movies with such high ambitions, ""Big Fish"" offers a lot to cheer about, yet it still misses something. The film relates a story of Edward Bloom, an aged (and now dying) man, whose life, although rather ordinary, is enhanced by his wild imagination to a kaleidoscope of extraordinary, magic-tinged stories. Almost everyone is touched by those -- except for Ed's son Will (Billy Crudup), who nevertheless does not give up and sets out to learn something more about his dad before it may be too late.The trademark Tim Burton's direction (after ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"" we now have Ed Bloom) once again weaves the real with the magic, but especially the magic does not work fully (despite great work by the star-studded cast). True, one might be inclined to say that Burton was avoiding the saccharine sweetness of many Hollywood melodramas on purpose.Anyway, Ewan McGregor (young Ed) and especially Albert Finney (old Ed) feel like at home in their roles, Crudup (""Almost Famous"") offers a low-key acting of a decent caliber, yet the show-stealing are two actresses: Jessica Lange as Ed's wife in later years and Helena Bonham Carter as a grown-up Jenny, years later following her first encounter with young Ed.""Big Fish"" is a fully-fledged tribute to storytelling. It had a potential to be an ultimate one, but, unfortunately some ""magic"" scenes did not cut it well enough and remained on the level of average imagination. The real was real enough (sometimes even more magical than the 'magic', i.e. a bathtub scene with Finney and Lange) and the film deserves over-all kudos, at least for being a family fun, which is rare these days; also for music and production design.

804546,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0001GOH6Q,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[3, 5]","Tim Burton is back. The macabe genius has slipped up here lately with his re-make of ""Planet Of The Apes"", but the man is back and in a big way. Burton has always been able to take his audience on an incredible journey into the minds of oddball characters(Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood) and into the presence of magical worlds and fairy tales. Never has he done so with such brilliance as he has with this latest offering. The movie is about Edward Bloom, a man who is seen young(played by Ewan McGregor), and as his older present day self(played by Albert Finney). Edward is not long for this world, and his estranged son Will(Billy Crudup), comes back home with his expecting wife, to see his father and patch things up before it's too late. Will has always been hearing his father's wild tall tales, and has had enough. He wants the truth. He wants to know the man that his father really is before the man himself is no more. From his bed, Edward Sr. talks with his son and the discussion takes us through the life and journeys he has been in. Young Edward is seen as a young man with ambition and determination with a lot left over to spare. He is seen journeying through the world into haunted woods, enchanting towns, working in a traveling circus, and coming across people such as a giant, witches, werewolves, and other interesting characters. Will tries to get to the bottom of these tall tales that his father has been telling and claiming are as true as they can be. It's a son hoping to reconcile with the man, the father, that he never really knew. This is like ""Forrest Gump"", but in a way that only Tim Burton could tell it. The story and screenplay is solid and laced with delicate writing, settings, and colorful characterizations. The fact that this wonderful film was so overlooked during 'Awards' time was downright criminal. Burton's girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, appears in the film, as does Burton regular, Danny DeVito, who plays a circus ringleader. Jessica Lange plays Edward's wife in present day, Sandra, and that character is played in the past by Alison Lohman. Jessica is such a fine actress, and it's too bad she wasn't given more to do. They did a fine job of getting the two actresses to play the same character. Crudup is a fine young actor and he does a solid job as the confused son searching for answers. Who wouldn't be in his place?. Who would believe the stories, or some of them, would be true?. Every frame is flawlessly choreographed, and the sets and art direction are magical, clear, colorful, and have a very serene feel. This is definitley Burton's masterpiece. It is a film that seems more human than anything he has done. The acting is sincere. Ewan brings an enthusiasm and down home charm to his role as the younger Edward, and he is enigmatic throughout. You are instantly charmed and even though you already know how he turns out, you root for him and wish him the best on his journey in life. Albert Finney does a fine job as the older, ailing Edward.

804549,AR37967IAR6ZT,B0001GOH6Q,Benjamin,"[3, 6]","Tim Burton's BIG FISH is essentially two hours spent hearing the stories of Edward Bloom, the sort of guy who, in real life, would be considered obnoxious and unbearable but, in a movie, is regarded as a quaint treasure. Bloom's tales of giants, circus freaks, werewolves, enchanted fish, enchanted towns and one-eyed witches in the mountains of Alabama are clearly fiction, though not really good fiction. In the film, his son is annoyed - looking to hear a bit of truth from his dad before Bloom drops dead.  All he finds out, unfortunately, is that his dad didn't stretch the truth all that much ... and, apparently, that the truth wasn't really important anyway.Yeah, in a movie, it's supposed to be all uplifting. But I refuse to see Billy Crudup's character in a negative light just because he's the only one refusing his father's painful whimsy. If you were sitting next to Edward Bloom for a long period of time, too, you'd want him to stop talking nonsense, too.BIG FISH, which all Tim Burton fans will rush out to see, is his most grounded-in-reality film, I suppose. It's got a clever group of actors who make the most of the material that they're given.The main problem with the film, I guess, is that Burton himself is far more interested in the colorful world of Bloom's stories. Burton's never been very good at a connected, driven narrative, anyway. It's always been more style than substance.Because of that, Burton all but ignores making the ""real life"" bits as good as the stylized ""stories."" And the two elements never really come together. Never is there a moment where we feel the character McGregor is playing becomes the character Finney is playing, and the film needs that.It's pretty to look at, but it's a letdown.",3,Too 'fantastic' to be fantastic.,1073779200,"01 11, 2004",2004,1741,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'essentially', 'two', 'hours', 'spent', 'hearing', 'stories', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'sort', 'guy', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'obnoxious', 'unbearable', 'movie', 'regarded', 'quaint', 'treasure', 'Bloom', 'tales', 'giants', 'circus', 'freaks', 'werewolves', 'enchanted', 'fish', 'enchanted', 'towns', 'one-eyed', 'witches', 'mountains', 'Alabama', 'are', 'clearly', 'fiction', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'fiction', 'film', 'son', 'annoyed', 'looking', 'hear', 'bit', 'truth', 'dad', 'Bloom', 'dead', 'out', 'unfortunately', 'dad', 'did', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'truth', 'that', 'much', 'apparently', 'truth', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'important', 'anyway.Yeah', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'uplifting', 'refuse', 'see', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'character', 'negative', 'light', 'just', 'only', 'one', 'refusing', 'father', 'painful', 'whimsy', 'were', 'sitting', 'next', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'too', ""'d"", 'want', 'stop', 'talking', 'nonsense', 'too.BIG', 'FISH', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fans', 'will', 'rush', 'out', 'see', 'most', 'grounded-in-reality', 'film', 'suppose', 'got', 'clever', 'group', 'actors', 'who', 'make', 'most', 'material', ""'re"", 'given.The', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'guess', 'Burton', 'far', 'more', 'interested', 'colorful', 'world', 'Bloom', 'stories', 'Burton', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'connected', 'driven', 'narrative', 'anyway', 'always', 'been', 'more', 'style', 'substance.Because', 'Burton', 'ignores', 'making', 'real', 'life', 'bits', 'as', 'good', 'stylized', 'stories', 'two', 'elements', 'never', 'really', 'come', 'together', 'Never', 'there', 'moment', 'where', 'feel', 'character', 'McGregor', 'playing', 'becomes', 'character', 'Finney', 'playing', 'film', 'that.It', 'pretty', 'look', 'letdown']",N/A

It just seems like a lot of movies lately are lacking in some arena, whether it is story or dialogue or visual elements, and I have to say something like, ""It was a good movie, except..."" Not the case with this one. Big Fish has an amazing story (always good when you find yourself thinking...wow, I wish I had written this), good dialogue, and, as is usually the case with Tim Burton, amazing visuals. This is the story of Edward Bloom, an elderly man who is dying of cancer. His son, Will, comes to stay with his parents at this time, both to help take care of his father and to get to know him better. See, Edward has always been a weaver of tall tales, and Will is frustrated by the fact that he doesn't know anything real about his father, only the stories that he told. The movie jumps back and forth between the past and the present. The past is told through Edward's stories, and they are absolutely beautiful visually. For example, the first scenes when Edward visits the town of Spectre have a soft focus warmly lit feel that really makes you understand why they say that no one has ever left the town before--it just looks that perfect. The performances in the movie are generally very good, especially that of Albert Finney who has some superbly touching scenes with Jessica Lange.

804554,A3DM08AHYJHS0P,B0001GOH6Q,"""boxingelena2000""","[2, 4]","The one characteristic Tim Burton doesn't lack is creativity. Each one of the contemporary auteur's films has a distinctive visual style. In 'PeeWee's Great Adventure' huge bicycles roamed a wondrously colorful city. In 'Beetlejuice' it was the protagonist, as well as the striped snakes and the world of the dead, that dominated the screen with gushing energy. The original 'Batman''s Gotham City never looked better - The Joker', and the sequel's Catwoman and Mr. Penguin remain much more efficiently realized than the following duds (Robin, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, so on...) 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood', 'Mars Attacks', 'Sleepy Hollow', even 'The Planet of the Apes' - all of Tim Burton's films have an underlying creepiness to them, a little something that is both fascinating and disturbing.'Big Fish' is Tim Burton holding his horses. His readiness for full-throttle visual attacks seems a bit strained. Sentiment runs through the film, as does the sappy soundtrack from the usually-stellar Burton mate Danny Elfman, and cultimates in a stretched out final act, which works in the context of the film's dramatical narration, but might disappoint fans expecting 100% Burton.The performances are all decent. Albert Finney (who saved 'Erin Brockovich' from utter boredom) plays a dying man who neglects the world's cruel reality and immerses himself into his imaginary world, full of idealized fantasies. Certain elements are added to truth, and when his son (Billy Crudup - 'Jesus' Son')shows up with his wife, he wants to hear the real story of his father's life, without the lies.Fact is, they are not lies, they are enhanced events. The man reminisces about his young days, the film transporting us to Ewan MacGregor as the young version of the man, on his quest to conquer the world. On the way he (and a giant, don't ask) fights off jumping spiders, flees from a way-too-perfect town, encounters the girl of his dreams, works in a circus, fights in the war....so on and so on.The running theme through the movie is reaching one's ambition. As it chronicles the old man's life though through his eyes, we as the audience forget the real world and get immersed into his story. Then Burton annoyingly brings us back to the real world and reminds us it's just this man's rant. So okay, the guy can't handle reality, but why should we care enough to be engulfed in his dreams?Because in his dreams is when Tim Burton unleashes his magic and brings to life the sub-concious fierce freakiness of images, bringing to mind Edward in 'Edward Scissorhands' cutting his face with his metal fingers. The giant, a werewolf, asian siamese singers, a bloody mouth in a sea of yellow tulips...The images are dazzling indeed, but get rudely taken away every once in a while to display the gloominess and monotony of our society.Albert Finney holds those bits together well. His character barely moves, strapped to his deathbed, but there is a sparkle in his eye, and the internal knowledge that his stories aren't true but kept him going damn fine. Ewan MacGregor is solid, if not resembling the 'older version' at all. Billy Crudup is always reliable, but is underused here in a slightly underwritten part.Startling images and solid acting prevent 'Big Fish' from slipping into Hollywood schmaltz. It isn't subtle, the messages are hammered into your head, and the ending is stretched out, but it will keep your entertained nevertheless, perhaps with a little twinge of disappointment in the great director.",3,Tim Burton Lite,1075161600,"01 27, 2004",2004,3502,"['one', 'characteristic', 'Tim', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'lack', 'creativity', 'one', 'contemporary', 'auteur', 'films', 'distinctive', 'visual', 'style', 'Great', 'Adventure', 'huge', 'bicycles', 'roamed', 'wondrously', 'colorful', 'city', ""'Beetlejuice"", 'was', 'protagonist', 'as', 'well', 'striped', 'snakes', 'world', 'dead', 'dominated', 'screen', 'gushing', 'energy', 'original', ""'Batman"", 's', 'Gotham', 'City', 'never', 'looked', 'better', 'Joker', 'sequel', 'Catwoman', 'Mr.', 'Penguin', 'remain', 'much', 'more', 'efficiently', 'realized', 'following', 'duds', 'Robin', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Two-Face', 'so', 'Scissorhands', 'Wood', 'Attacks', 'Hollow', 'even', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'have', 'underlying', 'creepiness', 'little', 'something', 'fascinating', 'disturbing', ""'Big"", 'Fish', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'holding', 'horses', 'readiness', 'full-throttle', 'visual', 'attacks', 'bit', 'strained', 'Sentiment', 'film', 'sappy', 'soundtrack', 'usually-stellar', 'Burton', 'mate', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'cultimates', 'stretched', 'out', 'final', 'act', 'context', 'film', 'dramatical', 'narration', 'might', 'disappoint', 'fans', 'expecting', '100', '%', 'Burton.The', 'performances', 'are', 'decent', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'saved', ""'Erin"", 'Brockovich', 'utter', 'boredom', 'dying', 'man', 'who', 'world', 'cruel', 'reality', 'imaginary', 'world', 'full', 'idealized', 'fantasies', 'Certain', 'elements', 'are', 'added', 'truth', 'when', 'son', 'Billy', 'Crudup', ""'Jesus"", 'Son', 'up', 'wife', 'hear', 'real', 'story', 'father', 'life', 'lies.Fact', 'are', 'not', 'lies', 'are', 'enhanced', 'events', 'man', 'young', 'days', 'film', 'transporting', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'young', 'version', 'man', 'quest', 'conquer', 'world', 'way', 'giant', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'fights', 'off', 'jumping', 'spiders', 'flees', 'way-too-perfect', 'town', 'girl', 'dreams', 'works', 'circus', 'fights', 'war', '.so', 'so', 'on.The', 'running', 'theme', 'movie', 'reaching', 'one', 'ambition', 'old', 'man', 'life', 'eyes', 'audience', 'forget', 'real', 'world', 'get', 'immersed', 'story', 'Then', 'Burton', 'annoyingly', 'back', 'real', 'world', 'just', 'man', 'rant', 'So', 'okay', 'guy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'reality', 'why', 'should', 'care', 'enough', 'be', 'engulfed', 'dreams', 'dreams', 'when', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'magic', 'life', 'sub-concious', 'fierce', 'freakiness', 'images', 'bringing', 'mind', 'Edward', ""'Edward"", 'Scissorhands', 'cutting', 'face', 'metal', 'fingers', 'giant', 'werewolf', 'asian', 'siamese', 'singers', 'bloody', 'mouth', 'sea', 'yellow', 'tulips', 'images', 'are', 'dazzling', 'indeed', 'get', 'rudely', 'taken', 'away', 'once', 'while', 'display', 'gloominess', 'monotony', 'society.Albert', 'Finney', 'bits', 'together', 'well', 'character', 'barely', 'strapped', 'deathbed', 'sparkle', 'eye', 'internal', 'knowledge', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'true', 'kept', 'going', 'damn', 'fine', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'solid', 'not', 'resembling', ""'older"", 'version', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'always', 'reliable', 'underused', 'here', 'slightly', 'underwritten', 'part.Startling', 'images', 'solid', 'acting', 'prevent', ""'Big"", 'Fish', 'slipping', 'Hollywood', 'schmaltz', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'messages', 'are', 'hammered', 'head', 'ending', 'stretched', 'out', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'nevertheless', 'perhaps', 'little', 'twinge', 'disappointment', 'great', 'director']",N/A

For 3 years, they don't speak. Then, returning home to Alabama from France, William tries mending his fragile relationship with his dying father, now stricken with cancer. Edward Bloom's stories of fame and fortune are hard to believe.  &quot;A giant man can't have an ordinary life!&quot; he barks. Related in flashbacks, Edward tones back to life as a charming traveling salesman. One day he wandered out of a creepy Southern swamp and stumbled into a forgotten, magical town called Spectre, where the grass is green, and the girls are barefoot...15 years ago, Hollywood veteran Tim Burton began a famous career in a Batman cape. He floundered for years as a wierdo-movie director. Now, for the first time in &quot;Big Fish&quot;, Burton measures human emotion with his penchant for the quirky and the macabre. Tim Burton has come of age. Disturbed by his own father's recent death, Burton focuses clearly on the traumatic loss of a parent. Here is gravity and restraint we have not seen before. &quot;Big Fish&quot; stars a marvelous Ewan McGregor as the youthful Edward Bloom. McGregor delivers another enchanting, facile performance. Co-stars include Albert Finney and Billy Crudup. Extending the Tim Burton movie legacy is Danny DeVito(from &quot;Batman Returns&quot;) and several sword-glove props lifted directly from &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;.

Extras include trailers, previews, 9 featurettes, a trivia quiz, and Burton's own commentary. An Easter egg is hidden on the main menu page. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is a mature fantasy surrounded by death's cold-hearted earthly truths. And there's a sense of wonder here.

804564,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B0001GOH6Q,C. B Collins Jr.,"[5, 5]","This film is essentially about story-telling. If you keep this in mind as you watch the film, it offers an interesting contrast between the story-telling of an elderly Alabama businessman, Ed Bloom, and the storytelling of the film's director, Tim Burton.Ed Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor in his youth and by Albert Finney in his old age, is a natural story-teller.  He takes the raw material of everyday life and enhances it, embellishes it, and pulls it together in an entertaining whole. Because his life had several odd twists and turns, he has more raw material for his stories than the average fellow.  His courtship of his wife Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her youth and by Jessica Lange in her maturity, comprises the most romantic and the longest tale in the story.Ed and Sandra have a son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, who has heard one tall tale too many and has become estranged from his father for the last 3 years while Will and his young wife live in Paris. The story moves from the vastly romantic courtship of Ed and Sandra to Will's stuggle with the relationship with his father. Basically Will assumes that if the stories are embellishments of truth that he does not really know his father. As his father is dying of cancer, Will tries to break through and find the real father underlying the tall tales. His father is insulted and hurt by this approach, and through his sick-bed story telling Ed captivates Will's beautiful young French wife.At the end of the film, the son Will, is left alone with his father as his father is dying and tells his father a tall tale of his father's death, surrounded by all those who have know and loved him, as he becomes a giant black catfish who swims away. At the end we see the son Will finally recognize that the tall tale, the embellished story, contains an essential truth that must be protected and clothed and escorted with the trapings of fantasy so as to be recognized, appreciated, and absorbed.This is the truth that Burton wishes for us to comprehend about the role of the storyteller and he relays this message in his own tall tale.As a final note, since I am from Alabama, I personnally enjoyed seeing the scenes that were filmed in old downtown Montgomery and on the Huntingdon College Campus.",4,Burton explores the role of the story-teller in a tall tale of his own.,1156550400,"08 26, 2006",2006,2271,"['film', 'essentially', 'story-telling', 'keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'film', 'interesting', 'contrast', 'story-telling', 'elderly', 'Alabama', 'businessman', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'storytelling', 'film', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton.Ed', 'Bloom', 'played', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'youth', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'old', 'age', 'natural', 'story-teller', 'raw', 'material', 'everyday', 'life', 'together', 'entertaining', 'whole', 'life', 'had', 'several', 'odd', 'twists', 'turns', 'more', 'raw', 'material', 'stories', 'average', 'fellow', 'courtship', 'wife', 'Sandra', 'played', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'youth', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'maturity', 'most', 'romantic', 'longest', 'tale', 'story.Ed', 'Sandra', 'have', 'son', 'Will', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'who', 'heard', 'one', 'tall', 'tale', 'too', 'many', 'become', 'estranged', 'father', 'last', '3', 'years', 'Will', 'young', 'wife', 'live', 'Paris', 'story', 'moves', 'vastly', 'romantic', 'courtship', 'Ed', 'Sandra', 'Will', 'stuggle', 'relationship', 'father', 'Basically', 'Will', 'stories', 'are', 'embellishments', 'truth', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'father', 'father', 'dying', 'cancer', 'Will', 'break', 'find', 'real', 'father', 'underlying', 'tall', 'tales', 'father', 'insulted', 'hurt', 'approach', 'sick-bed', 'story', 'telling', 'Ed', 'captivates', 'Will', 'beautiful', 'young', 'French', 'end', 'film', 'son', 'Will', 'left', 'alone', 'father', 'father', 'dying', 'father', 'tall', 'tale', 'father', 'death', 'surrounded', 'who', 'have', 'know', 'loved', 'giant', 'black', 'catfish', 'who', 'away', 'end', 'see', 'son', 'Will', 'finally', 'recognize', 'tall', 'tale', 'embellished', 'story', 'essential', 'truth', 'must', 'be', 'protected', 'clothed', 'escorted', 'trapings', 'fantasy', 'so', 'be', 'recognized', 'appreciated', 'absorbed.This', 'truth', 'Burton', 'wishes', 'comprehend', 'role', 'storyteller', 'message', 'own', 'tall', 'final', 'note', 'am', 'Alabama', 'personnally', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'scenes', 'were', 'filmed', 'old', 'downtown', 'Montgomery', 'Huntingdon', 'College', 'Campus']",N/A

As his son tries to piece together all the stories that he was told when he was younger, he begins to figure out that is maybe not all a myth.When the stories are told, Ewan McGregor plays a younger version of this man, during the 1950s and 1960s. In his fantasy-like adventures, he tells how he encountered a gentle giant, saved the town that he lived in, and met his true love (Alison Lohman) through months of work in a circus to get the ringmaster (Danny DeVito) to tell him more about the girl that he'd seen but did not know.

It also leaves much to be desired when exploring the relationships of sons & fathers.  It is probably best not to try and seek deeper truths from this movie.Nonetheless, it is quite entertaining, by and large.  As Edward Bloom understood, the deeper truths of a story really pale in comparison with how good of a story it is in the first place.  For this reviewer at least, a really good story about a bunch of really good stories is justification for liking it.  My four-star rating comes with the qualification that at times, it promises to deliver more than it really can, and tries to be more than it really is, and stumbles as a result.

It's GREAT, inventive, and packs an emotional wallop.Big Fish is the story of a family, essentially.  The father is a notorious teller of tall tales, and his son has had his fill of them.  The father is in his final days, and the son comes home at his mother's urging, hopefully to help bridge the gaps in their relationship, and to maybe help the son 'get' his father, who he can't understand.In typical Burton fashion, this movie has visuals that can be larger than life.  However, in context of this story, it works SO well, as the backstory for a man whose life itself may be larger than legend would have is perfect.  The set design and cinematography lend such a surreal quality to tales that may or may not be tall.  It provides a world that have just enough realism to keep the audience wondering 'Hmmm...maybe he's NOT exaggerating.'By far, this film is Burton's best work yet.  I've found Burton throws people into two camps, 'Love him' or 'Hate him.'  This is definitely a middle of the road Burton that can easily be watched by non-Burton fans, because the story of Father-son estrangement is universal, and Burton's storytelling gives the highly emotional subject enough whimsy to make it enjoyable, but never loses the powerful emotions of the characters and should easily move the most hardened heart with it's interesting examination of parent/child relationships.This really is a can't miss addition to one's collection, and I can highly recommend it to those who like films with emotional punch and stories that make you think.  An added bonus, is that you will find you need to rewatch it several times to pick up subtle nuances the tall tales tell.",4,How could this have been overlooked by the Academy????,1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1815,"['Big', 'Fish', 'terrific', 'film', 'once', 'viewed', 'will', 'leave', 'scratching', 'head', 'why', 'was', 'noticebly', 'snubbed', '2003', 'Academy', 'awards', 'GREAT', 'inventive', 'emotional', 'wallop.Big', 'Fish', 'story', 'family', 'essentially', 'father', 'notorious', 'teller', 'tall', 'tales', 'son', 'had', 'fill', 'father', 'final', 'days', 'son', 'home', 'mother', 'urging', 'hopefully', 'help', 'bridge', 'gaps', 'relationship', 'maybe', 'help', 'son', 'father', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand.In', 'typical', 'Burton', 'fashion', 'movie', 'visuals', 'can', 'be', 'larger', 'life', 'However', 'context', 'story', 'SO', 'well', 'backstory', 'man', 'life', 'may', 'be', 'larger', 'legend', 'would', 'have', 'perfect', 'set', 'design', 'cinematography', 'lend', 'surreal', 'quality', 'tales', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'tall', 'world', 'have', 'just', 'enough', 'realism', 'keep', 'audience', 'wondering', ""'Hmmm"", 'maybe', 'NOT', 'exaggerating', 'far', 'film', 'Burton', 'best', 'work', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Burton', 'people', 'two', 'camps', ""'Love"", ""'Hate"", 'definitely', 'middle', 'road', 'Burton', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'watched', 'non-Burton', 'fans', 'story', 'Father-son', 'estrangement', 'universal', 'Burton', 'storytelling', 'highly', 'emotional', 'subject', 'enough', 'whimsy', 'make', 'enjoyable', 'never', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'characters', 'should', 'easily', 'move', 'most', 'hardened', 'heart', 'interesting', 'examination', 'parent/child', 'relationships.This', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'miss', 'addition', 'one', 'collection', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'who', 'like', 'films', 'emotional', 'punch', 'stories', 'make', 'think', 'added', 'bonus', 'will', 'find', 'need', 'rewatch', 'several', 'times', 'pick', 'up', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'tall', 'tales', 'tell']",N/A
804576,A3KGYTO6CF8MGF,B0001GOH6Q,"Clarissa ""MoonGoddess""","[2, 4]","With films like Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow under his belt, it seems that my favorite director, Tim Burton, can do no wrong when it comes to imaginative storytelling. I hardly ever get a chance to go to the movies so I've been wanting to rent this for the longest time now but the wait was well worth it. I've always enjoyed weird, quirky films that are slightly off the beaten path and &quot;Big Fish&quot; is definitely one of those films.Based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie is pretty much about a son trying to understand his dying father whom he never really knew while incorporating elements of tall tales and myths through flashbacks of the eccentric adventures his father, Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor when he was a young man) told him growing up, such as his brave encounter with a witch who has a glass eye that foretells the way one will eventually die if they dare stare into it (and that's simply the tip of the iceberg, so to speak). Finding it hard to believe the fables his father tells to be true he sets out to unravel the truth by visiting Jennifer Hill (played by Helena Bonham Carter) after finding a deed to a town he'd thought to be make-believe called Spector. &quot;Big Fish&quot;, however, is not as it appears. It is every bit a drama as it is a fantasy. It may not be my favorite Tim Burton film but it's uniquely different yet similar in feel to the other projects he's worked on, and that's probably because it's unlike anything in the theaters for Tim Burton is known to take risks by straying far from the usual. He's a visionary and a dreamer and &quot;Big Fish&quot; is a charming, delightful journey not to be missed...Hope this review wasn't too brief but I don't wish to explain what happens in too much detail.

804578,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B0001GOH6Q,"Cloud ""...""","[3, 3]","It's funny that despite films like Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands on his resume, Tim Burton is always known as director behind Batman and its sequel, Sleepy Hollow and Beetlejuice, very dark gothic films. So it's quite surprise to see Big Fish, not only because it's tonally different but also cause it's good.Will is trying to figure out the kind of man his father is, only problem is his father is Edward Bloom. He's particularly known for telling wild stories to the point where they become just mere fairytale-like which is exactly what Will hates. So before Ed dies, Will wants to know his dad once and for all.In flashback mode, Edward as a young kid got a glimpse into his death by means of a witch with a magical glass eye. So he decides what anyone would probably do: go nuts and explore the world. His adventures find himself finding a colorful town, in the war, meeting the girl of his dreams from the moment he first saw her and being his own boss. He ends up meeting a wild assortment of characters including a really big giant, a Ron Jeremy look-alike circus runner and a poet.It's quite a change from film like Sleepy Hollow but his trademark visual style is still here. I think what sets this fim apart from other films with similar set design is that here it feels natural and not too flashy. Meanwhile something like Chocolate Factory where yeah it was really vibrant but it felt rather plastic oddly enough, as if it was designed solely to get a rise out of people. Here it falls in naturally.Acting-wise is pretty straight across the board. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney do great jobs as young and old Edward Bloom and always dependable and cutie Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange plays his love Sandra. The rest of them are kind of one-note but they're endearing anyway so we don't really mind.For people wondering whether it's worth the double dip if you have the original, ask yourself one question: do you want a book? Because that's pretty much what this release does that's different. It's a book filled with artwork. The DVD is essentially the same, probably right down to its packaging too(I didn't buy the old one).If you're a big fan of Edward Scissorhands, you'll probably get into this one.

804581,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0001GOH6Q,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[2, 2]","Tim Burton is such a predictable director of films that even when, on the surface, he seems to be stretching himself, he's actually merely distorting art towards his own relentlessly immature aesthetic. In a sense he's the dark filmic counterpoint to Steven Spielberg's gauzey light pabulum. Neither has a fundamental grasp of what it is to be human, nor the essence of a good tale. Quirkiness does not equal interesting. If you doubt that you must find Tourette's sufferers fascinating rather than annoying.Big Fish is TB's attempt to do `adult' drama, yet it so desperately tries to rip off the best in other films- even less successful ones like Forrest Gump, a tale similarly set in Alabama. Along with that film's everyman-ness Big Fish tries to channel the warmth of My Dog Skip, the father-son dynamic of October Sky, & the rites of passage feel of Stand By Me. While it does not succeed as well as the aforementioned trio this is a good movie. Yet, dammit, with another director this could have been a great movie, certainly alot better than Burton's previous bests- the flawed but interesting Ed Wood and Planet Of The Apes. Instead, it's maybe just a little better. It's like when you see the goddess of your dreams but she turns out to be an Anti-Semite, smoker, or lesbian.Let me remove myself from despair & give you the capsule tale: an old talespinner- Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying and his son, Will (Billy Crudup), wants to know the reality behind the stories that so charm everyone else- including Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard). The last few days of Ed's life give way to flashbacks and fantasies. The young Ed (Ewan McGregor) has all sorts of adventures: he meets a giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), discovers a Utopian town called Spectre, befriends a witch, catches an elusive legendary big fish, and joins a circus run by a werewolf named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). He joins the circus to get information on the girl of his dreams- the young Sandra (Alison Lohman) who's engaged to his childhood nemesis. Later, he becomes a military spy and rescues a pair of gorgeous Chinese Siamese twins named Ping and Jing from the Red Army.... Still, this is overall a good film- there is a wonderful sequence where young Ed 1st sees Sandra and time stops. He walks through hoops and juggler's balls fall to the ground as he walks by. This is a great sequence because it does simulate that feeling, but we've seen the time-stop before. What makes the scene a winner is that, to compensate for that momentary sensation, time has to speed up. Doing so causes Ed his opportunity to meet and woo Sandra for a few years.This is truly unique, but- alack- the only instance of using fantasy to serve a narrative purpose, and not just be `ooh-ah' fantastical! That TB only does this once in the film confirms it was a happy accident, not an understood exercise of filmic control. Still, the acting of Finney and McGregor is superb, as are the other supporting performances.",3,"Good, but could've been more",1220832000,"09 8, 2008",2008,3037,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'such', 'predictable', 'director', 'films', 'even', 'when', 'surface', 'be', 'stretching', 'actually', 'merely', 'distorting', 'art', 'own', 'relentlessly', 'immature', 'aesthetic', 'sense', 'dark', 'filmic', 'counterpoint', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'gauzey', 'light', 'pabulum', 'fundamental', 'grasp', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'essence', 'good', 'tale', 'Quirkiness', 'not', 'equal', 'interesting', 'doubt', 'must', 'find', 'Tourette', 'sufferers', 'fascinating', 'rather', 'annoying.Big', 'Fish', 'TB', 'attempt', 'do', 'adult', 'drama', 'so', 'desperately', 'rip', 'off', 'best', 'other', 'films-', 'even', 'less', 'successful', 'ones', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'tale', 'similarly', 'set', 'Alabama', 'film', 'everyman-ness', 'Big', 'Fish', 'channel', 'warmth', 'My', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'father-son', 'dynamic', 'October', 'Sky', 'rites', 'passage', 'feel', 'Stand', 'Me', 'not', 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'trio', 'good', 'movie', 'dammit', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'certainly', 'alot', 'better', 'Burton', 'previous', 'bests-', 'flawed', 'interesting', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Instead', 'maybe', 'just', 'little', 'better', 'when', 'see', 'goddess', 'dreams', 'out', 'be', 'Anti-Semite', 'smoker', 'lesbian.Let', 'remove', 'despair', 'give', 'capsule', 'tale', 'old', 'talespinner-', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'dying', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'know', 'reality', 'stories', 'so', 'charm', 'everyone', 'else-', 'including', 'Ed', 'wife', 'Sandra', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Will', 'wife', 'Josephine', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'last', 'few', 'days', 'Ed', 'life', 'give', 'way', 'flashbacks', 'fantasies', 'young', 'Ed', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'sorts', 'adventures', 'giant', 'named', 'Karl', 'Matthew', 'McGrory', 'Utopian', 'town', 'called', 'Spectre', 'witch', 'elusive', 'legendary', 'big', 'fish', 'circus', 'run', 'werewolf', 'named', 'Amos', 'Calloway', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'circus', 'get', 'information', 'girl', 'dreams-', 'young', 'Sandra', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'who', 'engaged', 'childhood', 'nemesis', 'Later', 'military', 'spy', 'pair', 'gorgeous', 'Chinese', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'named', 'Ping', 'Jing', 'Red', 'Army', 'Still', 'overall', 'good', 'film-', 'wonderful', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', 'Ed', '1st', 'sees', 'Sandra', 'time', 'stops', 'hoops', 'juggler', 'balls', 'fall', 'ground', 'great', 'sequence', 'simulate', 'feeling', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time-stop', 'before', 'What', 'scene', 'winner', 'compensate', 'momentary', 'sensation', 'time', 'speed', 'up', 'Doing', 'so', 'Ed', 'opportunity', 'meet', 'woo', 'Sandra', 'few', 'years.This', 'truly', 'unique', 'but-', 'alack-', 'only', 'instance', 'using', 'fantasy', 'serve', 'narrative', 'purpose', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'ooh-ah', 'fantastical', 'only', 'once', 'film', 'was', 'happy', 'accident', 'not', 'understood', 'exercise', 'filmic', 'control', 'Still', 'acting', 'Finney', 'McGregor', 'superb', 'are', 'other', 'supporting', 'performances']",N/A

Yes, it is about fathers and sons and families and the way they hold things together with stories of various kinds.  And yes, each of us has more in our lives than even those closest to us really know as they have more than we can ever know.Is it a great movie?  I don't think so.  However, I think it is a very good movie.  It never does come down on the hard edge of what all of this really means in each of our lives.  The movie seems to think it is enough to wrestle a bit with the way lies, poetry and truth fit together.  Well, that really isn't enough for a great work of art.  I did enjoy the poetry of it all and visually the movie is breathtaking.  But in a way it is cold in the way a post card is colder and more impersonal than your own snapshot even though it is many times more beautiful than what you were able to produce.We really don't get into these people terribly deeply except in one extraordinary scene where Ed and Sandra Bloom (Albert Finney and Jessica Lange) are in the bathtub in their clothes.  It is an amazingly truthful and achingly touching scene with barely a word being said about what is being communicated between them.Ewan McGregor does a fine job as the young Ed Bloom and Billy Crudup's portrayal of the son, Will Bloom, learning that reality isn't quite as cut and dried as he had always thought.  It was wonderful to see Robert Guillaume again.  He does a fine job as the family doctor and has an important scene teaching Will Bloom a bit about the difference between facts and truth.There are many other fine performances and I don't want to come across as being down on the movie.

Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dieing, and it's becuase of this, and because of this only, that his son William (Crudup) returns home with his pregnant wife (7 months to the day).  William has no relationship with his father, mostly because he has a misconstrued perseption of who his father really is.  All he has in memory of his father are the 'tall tales' he told him as a child.  Theres a fundamental truth that runs throughout this film, and it's that as children sometimes we take our parents for granted, we assume the worst, and worse yet, when we don't understand them or don't want to understand them we can write them off completly.  As William finds out through the recollection with his fathers stories, not everything he knows is a lie and his idea of who is father is couldn't be further from the truth.

804595,A1PLRDMBCSULMI,B0001GOH6Q,Daniel Ferrisi,"[2, 2]","Tim Burton is an acquired taste. His flights of fancy and flourishes of eccentric style make him one of the most divisive directors in cinema today. Big Fish, the director's latest, is actually half Burtonian and half family drama. When the images and occurrences are larger than life, the film zips along with plenty of eye candy to sweeten one's taste buds. When the film lurches into the dramatic, the pace flags despite solid acting and a story that's a step or two away from touching. On the whole, because it is so uneven, the two-hour film feels overlong in spite of all the pieces being in place for greatness.Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a man who loves to tell tall tales about his life experiences. His energetic delivery and unmitigated exuberance leave his audiences, disbelieving though they may be, uniformly rapt. That is, except for his son William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a straight-laced reporter who feels that he has lived his entire life without ever knowing the truth of his father. Upon hearing about Edward's impending death, after three years of silence between the two, William travels to his father's bedside with his pregnant wife in tow. There, in Edward's final days, William tries to finally break through the fairy tale facade he's always lived with to understand the stranger he calls dad.Though Edward is weak, he can't resist spinning stories to his son's French bride. The film traces Edward's life as a young man this way, featuring Ewan McGregor as the young wanderer. This is probably McGregor's best performance to date, because even though Moulin Rouge is a superior film, this role is more focused on acting and a pure emotional connection with the audience. McGregor succeeds on both counts, creating an extremely likeable and always fascinating character to observe. It is a testament to the quality of his performance that he is never overshadowed by the oddball characters he comes across.And speaking of oddball characters, Burton really shows his stuff when young Edward is traversing Alabama. The impressive array of people he meets includes a giant named Karl, a one-eyed witch (Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter), Japanese Siamese twins, a swarthy old-time carny (Danny DeVito with a wavering Southern accent) and the bare-footed residents of the idyllic town Spectre. This portion of the film includes a haunted forest, a prophetic glass eye and more fantastical fun. Undoubtedly the strongest portion of the film, these flashbacks are both beautiful and energizing.Tim Burton, who reportedly had a rocky relationship with his father, found his a very personal project and cannot be blamed for turning on the sentimental waterworks near the end of the film. However, after having so much fun with Ewan McGregor, the viewer doesn't want to shed a tear with a dying old man and his stuffy son. Our reluctance to accept the film's tonal shift probably explains why Big Fish isn't as moving as the recent Monster and House of Sand and Fog are. The film is pulling in two different directions at once, and invariably, the weaker side ends up being dragged in the dust.Big Fish is certainly worth seeing, and if the personal connection is there for you, it may work as well as it obviously hopes to. For me, the happy-go-lucky filmgoer, I would have traded the hour or so of Finney/Crudup for a half-hour more of Ewan. After all, if you aren't going to a Burton film for magic, why bother going at all?Final Grade: B+",4,Burton crafts a film that's half excellent and half good,1074124800,"01 15, 2004",2004,3476,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'acquired', 'taste', 'flights', 'fancy', 'flourishes', 'eccentric', 'style', 'make', 'one', 'most', 'divisive', 'directors', 'cinema', 'today', 'Big', 'Fish', 'director', 'latest', 'actually', 'half', 'Burtonian', 'half', 'family', 'drama', 'When', 'images', 'occurrences', 'are', 'larger', 'life', 'film', 'zips', 'plenty', 'eye', 'candy', 'sweeten', 'one', 'taste', 'buds', 'When', 'film', 'dramatic', 'pace', 'solid', 'acting', 'story', 'step', 'two', 'away', 'touching', 'whole', 'so', 'uneven', 'two-hour', 'film', 'feels', 'overlong', 'spite', 'pieces', 'being', 'place', 'greatness.Edward', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'man', 'who', 'tell', 'tall', 'tales', 'life', 'experiences', 'energetic', 'delivery', 'unmitigated', 'exuberance', 'leave', 'audiences', 'disbelieving', 'may', 'be', 'uniformly', 'rapt', 'son', 'William', 'Bloom', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'straight-laced', 'reporter', 'who', 'lived', 'entire', 'life', 'ever', 'knowing', 'truth', 'father', 'hearing', 'Edward', 'impending', 'death', 'three', 'years', 'silence', 'two', 'William', 'father', 'bedside', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'tow', 'Edward', 'final', 'days', 'William', 'finally', 'break', 'fairy', 'tale', 'facade', 'always', 'lived', 'understand', 'stranger', 'dad.Though', 'Edward', 'weak', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'spinning', 'stories', 'son', 'French', 'bride', 'film', 'Edward', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'way', 'featuring', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'young', 'wanderer', 'probably', 'McGregor', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'even', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', 'superior', 'film', 'role', 'more', 'focused', 'acting', 'pure', 'emotional', 'connection', 'audience', 'McGregor', 'counts', 'creating', 'extremely', 'likeable', 'always', 'fascinating', 'character', 'observe', 'testament', 'quality', 'performance', 'never', 'overshadowed', 'oddball', 'characters', 'across.And', 'speaking', 'oddball', 'characters', 'Burton', 'really', 'stuff', 'when', 'young', 'Edward', 'traversing', 'Alabama', 'impressive', 'array', 'people', 'giant', 'named', 'Karl', 'one-eyed', 'witch', 'Burton', 'real-life', 'love', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Japanese', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'swarthy', 'old-time', 'carny', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'wavering', 'Southern', 'accent', 'bare-footed', 'residents', 'idyllic', 'town', 'Spectre', 'portion', 'film', 'haunted', 'forest', 'prophetic', 'glass', 'eye', 'more', 'fantastical', 'fun', 'Undoubtedly', 'strongest', 'portion', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'beautiful', 'energizing.Tim', 'Burton', 'who', 'reportedly', 'had', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'father', 'found', 'very', 'personal', 'project', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'turning', 'sentimental', 'waterworks', 'end', 'film', 'However', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'want', 'shed', 'tear', 'dying', 'old', 'man', 'stuffy', 'son', 'reluctance', 'accept', 'film', 'tonal', 'shift', 'probably', 'why', 'Big', 'Fish', ""n't"", 'as', 'moving', 'recent', 'Monster', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'are', 'film', 'pulling', 'two', 'different', 'directions', 'once', 'invariably', 'weaker', 'side', 'up', 'being', 'dragged', 'dust.Big', 'Fish', 'certainly', 'worth', 'seeing', 'personal', 'connection', 'there', 'may', 'work', 'as', 'well', 'obviously', 'happy-go-lucky', 'filmgoer', 'would', 'have', 'traded', 'hour', 'so', 'Finney/Crudup', 'half-hour', 'more', 'Ewan', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'Burton', 'film', 'magic', 'why', 'bother', 'going', 'Final', 'Grade', 'B+']",N/A

What it will leave you with is a feel-good feeling while you'll be searching for a clean hanky.Better known for his oddly different movies such as Edward scissorhands, and sleepy hollow, Tim Burton has constructed a movie that seems impossibly fairy-tale like in its intense beauty of story telling and lush settings, while still keeping the draber side of the story (reality) enthralling.Williem Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who grew up with his storytelling father, (Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor) who always seemed to have wonderful exciting things happening to him. Even if they seemed to wild to believe, Edward manages to make them truly real. However children cannot stay young always, and finally Will grows up to despise his fathers storys, believing its the lies of a man who is has been discontent with his life and family. Lies he has invented to soothe himself that his life didn't turn out the particulare way he wanted. The people he has met, the things he has done never happened, only in his imagination that is. People alive only in the reality of his father dillusional mindUnable to listen to his father any longer, he tells him that he justs wants to know the real him. ""But I've told you!"" Edward replies, "" You just haven't been listening."" So begins the journey through the fantastic mind of one man who believed the world was designed to be lived to  the fullest. He was the master of his destiny and death was just yet another adventure to be looked forward to.The end is the best part of the fairy tale, when Edward is dying and tells William to tell how he dies. Coming from a man who has spent his life polishing his life up, it is his son's turn to follow his footsteps. Follow Will does, turning his fathers death into one of the most touching part of all the previous stories told.

Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs.  Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters.  It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system.  With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square.  No small feat if you ask me.But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded.  A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.  Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich).  You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.  Except none of them seem true.  Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish.  William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories.  But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner.  From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater.  The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.  I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.  What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.  It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.  Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face.  Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.  His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.Tim Burton's directing is top notch.  He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.  He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.  His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines.  In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.BIG FISH is also a film about heritage.  What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.  Watching a life unfold around us.BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.  Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.  If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater.",5,TIM BURTON HAS DONE IT AGAIN,1070841600,"12 8, 2003",2003,3339,"['something', 'exhilarating', 'riding', 'two', 'trains', 'running', '27', 'blocks', 'down', 'street', 'see', 'movie', 'Living', '8', 'so', 'miles', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'perks', 'one', 'new', 'jobs', 'Going', 'press', 'screenings', 'yet', 'released', 'blockbusters', 'just', 'bad', ""'m"", 'mercy', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Transit', 'rail', 'system', 'delayed', 'trains', 'lots', 'snow', 'covering', 'ground', 'course', 'had', '10', 'minutes', 'get', 'Madison', 'Square', 'Garden', 'Union', 'Square', 'No', 'small', 'feat', 'ask', 'settled', 'down', 'chair', 'Regal', 'Union', 'Square', 'sipped', 'sweet', 'nectar', 'drink', 'called', 'COKE', 'film', 'unfolded', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'made', 'mad', 'dash', 'theater', 'worth', 'minute', 'reminisce', 'filmed', 'triumph', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'feel', 'sense', 'awe', 'wonder', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'created', 'film', 'better', 'EDWARD', 'SCISSORHANDS', 'film', 'worthy', 'Oscar.William', 'Bloom', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'mad', 'father', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Erin', 'Brockovich', 'see', 'dad', 'tell', 'stories', 'youth', 'none', 'seem', 'true', 'Stories', 'Giants', 'named', 'Karl', 'Matthew', 'McGrory', 'Bubble', 'Boy', 'Circus', 'Freaks', 'wandering', 'poets', 'Siamese', 'Twins', 'Red', 'China', 'bank', 'robberies', 'witch', 'really', 'big', 'fish', 'William', 'meet', 'real', 'man', 'stories', 'when', 'Edward', 'stricken', 'cancer', 'William', 'face', 'face', 'man', 'real', 'one', 'legend.BIG', 'FISH', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'new', 'surprise', 'hiding', 'around', 'corner', 'babies', 'being', 'spit', 'hospital', 'floor', 'classic', 'car', 'being', 'submerged', 'underwater', 'frame', 'jammed', 'visions', 'colorful', 'humorous', 'especially', 'liked', 'witch', 'one', 'eye', 'could', 'tell', 'how', 'would', 'die', 'What', 'eerie', 'yet', 'oddly', 'beautiful', 'old', 'woman', 'was.I', 'also', 'loved', 'tender', 'moment', 'Edward', 'wife', 'Sandy', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Titus', 'had', 'bathtub', 'scene', 'full', 'raw', 'emotion', 'sweet', 'reflection', 'Here', 'woman', 'who', 'watching', 'man', 'die', 'right', 'front', 'face', 'moment', 'word', 'breath', 'sacred.Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Attack', 'Cloans', 'fine', 'job', 'young', 'Edward', 'adventurous', 'youth', 'older', 'counterpoint', 'fantastical', 'stories', 'performance', 'right', 'cords', 'right', 'moments', 'allowing', 'audience', 'take', 'hold', 'man', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'fabrication', 'true', 'version', 'man', 'who', 'telling', 'story.Tim', 'Burton', 'directing', 'top', 'notch', 'proven', 'master', 'visual', 'image', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'perfect', 'film', 'allow', 'people', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'right', 'cord', 'humor', 'tears', 'joyous', 'circus', 'scary', 'forests', 'deft', 'eye', 'even', 'enemy', 'lines', 'scene', 'inspired', 'quirky', 'same', 'time.BIG', 'FISH', 'also', 'film', 'heritage', 'What', 'more', 'important', 'scheme', 'things', 'how', 'lived', 'how', 'people', 'remember', 'little', 'film', 'right', 'middle', 'Watching', 'life', 'unfold', 'us.BIG', 'FISH', 'reason', 'love', 'going', 'movies', 'Sure', 'sometimes', 'have', 'dig', 'trash', 'find', 'gem', 'gem', 'motion', 'picture', 'see', 'one', 'film', 'year', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'trip', 'even', 'whirlwind', '27-block', 'sprint', 'local', 'theater']",N/A
804599,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0001GOH6Q,David Baldwin,"[0, 2]","I am a huge fan of the work of director Tim Burton and have found something to redeem even his lesser work(Yes, ""Mars Attacks!"") with the exception of the misguided ""Planet of the Apes"" remake.  ""Big Fish"" is his most assured and mature work to date, if mature refers to a movie that contains giants, witches, and werewolves.  The film concerns the strained relationship between a dying Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The point of contention between the two seems to be the fabrications that the elder Bloom uses to relate about events of his life.  Edward Bloom clings to his dying breath to the truth of the tales he tells.  Young Will finds these stories disingenuous.  The film seems to come down on Edward's side in the sense that what is wrong with these minor digressions from reality when they make life that more interesting.  The acting in this film is superb.  Albert Finney as the elder Bloom is nothing short of spectacular. His work here was unfairly denied an Oscar nomination and possibly the gold trophy itself.  Why is it we take some of our finest actors for granted?  Ewan McGregor as Edward Bloom as a young man is every bit Finney's equal and he is another talent we take for granted.  The remainder of the cast (Jessica Lange, Crudup, Helena Bonham-Carter) are all good.  I would also like to cite Alison Lohman as Edward Bloom's wife as a young woman.  I saw her in ""Matchstick Men"" and she was nothing short of stupendous.  She is somebody to look out for in the future.  Burton's direction is surehanded, the script is excellent, the art direction and cinematography is breathtaking.  Another citation has to go to another one of Danny Elfman's masterful music scores.

Tales that range from the delightful to the delirious give life to giants, blizzards, a witch and so much more.

When his mother Sandra (ever so talented and beautiful Jessica Lange) tries to reunite them, Will must come to terms with his father and learn how to separate facts from fiction.Beautifully executed film. It is visually stunning loaded with brilliant performances, amazing story told in an equally amazing way.

The movie is well casted and acted, with the pacing and direction perfect.  Don't look for a complex storyline or big plot twist, because this movie really does not have much of a plot.  What it does have is a lot of heart, and characters you will enjoy spending 2 hours with.Edward Bloom(Albert Finney) is dying.  As his son Will(Billy Crudup)comes to visit, Edward recalls lots of stories from his youth, about how he met his wife, his son's birth, different experiences he had, jobs he held, and so on.  Edward as a young man is played by Ewan McGregor.  His son has heard it all before and is upset because it is all make believe.  He hates that his father continues to fabricate these lies.But the stories are magical and captivating.

Ed Bloom had loved telling tales impossible to take place to everyone, who fancied him for his humor and creativity. However, Will was sick of his father's unrealistic storytelling and blamed him for his absence from a large portion of his childhood. They were at odds after Will's wedding and had not conversed for several years. As Ed Bloom was approaching death, Will initiated a series of exploration of the ""truth"" to his father's exotic journeys and finally mended the feud with Ed before he passed away.Will re-experienced the symbolical treasures hiding beyond his father's adventures and finally came to realize what kind of person Ed was. When Ed was dying, Will told a story of the way Ed went to heaven that Ed saw in the witch's eye, in which he became a big fish as he always dreamed of, to soothe his fear of biting the dust. Most audience claimed that they were close to tears when they watch this part since the emotional outburst is unforgettable.Ed's magical journeys take up the most part of the movie, and if not exciting, the scenes are truly picturesque and the depiction is sparklingly humane. In the beginning, Ed was a boy with conspicuous potential constrained in a small town. After having made some unbelievable achievements (such as visiting a witch, winning the prize at a football match, etc.), he decided to leave the town with a giant to broaden his horizon. His stories covered nearly every aspect of human life, and with his adventurous attitude he had prove himself to be extraordinary. Sometimes those stories drag on rather too long, yet there are some brilliant points of view from Ed. Words like ""When one sees the love of his life, the time really stops as everyone says. But nobody has told you that they will go by twice as quickly when you want to catch up"" is classic.""Big Fish"" is thought provoking and there are many parts open to various interpretations. For my part, it assures me that it is not necessarily negative to engage myself in a fantasized world and I should not look at one thing only on its surface.

I was lured into seeing this film after reading and hearing all of the great reviews that this film got and let me tell you, this movie deserves all of the great reviews that it gets. Another thing that also made me want to see this was that it was directed by Tim Burton, one of my all time favorite directors. In fact, even as high of expectations that I had, this movie surpassed even those.""Big Fish"" is the tale of an elderly father named Edward Bloom. Edward and his son William have never really gotten along very well. Edward has told his son William about his eccentric and highly adventurous life during his younger years to his son when he was a child but William however found it to be too `fantasy-oriented' and wants to hear Edward's `real' story without resorting to talking like it's a `fantasy' world. After it turned into an argument the two became estranged for over three years but  Edward has fallen ill to a terminal illness and Will returns to see him and learn about his past. Flashing back into Edwards younger days, the movie showcases all of the fun not to mention outrageously adventurous things Edward did during his younger days.This movie is just absolutely amazing but it's also a mix of tears and laughter as it's one of the most bittersweet movies that I've ever watched. Tim Burton who usually showcased his trademark with his generally macabre natured movies completely takes a U-Turn and replaces the Halloween styles with a more southern classic atmosphere and he as a result breaks new ground in his career and it works almost perfectly.  Burton on a directing note, hits another home run right out of the park on this movie as well. The story is just stellar and brings out incredible depth to the father/son dynamic.The acting by the entire cast was absolutely stellar especially by Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom and also by Albert Finney as the much older Edward. The movie plot is just fun and not to mention heartbreaking yet funny all at the same time. It will leave you happy yet wanting to cry at the same time. This movie is so much fun and so emotional that I literally did not want it to end.

804615,A3JMWIOTUBOJI7,B0001GOH6Q,Donkey Dick,"[8, 8]","Tim Burton has been lambasted numerous times in the past as only caring about visuals, having characters that are nothing but caricatures, and in the case of BIG FISH, having characters that are only an excuse to segue into an exciting visual.Uh, wrong.There's more heart and soul in many of his films, namely EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and our topic of discussion today, BIG FISH, than in most other movies that I can think of. Each one brings a tear to my eye, each one is extremely beautiful, emotionally and visually, and each one tells a bittersweet truth about humanity, while enveloping us in a completely fantastical world at the same time.I saw BIG FISH for the first time last night and I ain't gonna forget it any time soon. It's the story of a son, played by Billy Crudup, and a father, played by Albert Finney, whose life after his son's birth consists of nothing but telling the same blown-up stories again and again. This could be due to, or the result of, never being close to his son, and never being able to properly communicate with him (or people in general). Or it could just be a man blowing up the truth due to an unconscious dissatisfaction with settling down, and giving up the freedom of his youth. It could be a lot of things.He spins yarns of 15' tall giants, witches, werewolves, tuna-sized catfish, bank robberies, mysterious towns, circuses, the Korean war, Siamese twins, and on and on, and his son is sick of hearing it. He just wants his father to tell him the truth, and is particularly humorless about it all, even as his father lays on his deathbed.The stories are shown in incredible, often visually stunning flashbacks, with the quixotic Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, and I was very satisfied to see that Tim Burton is still using predominantly non-CGI special effects -- or, if they were CGI, they were tangible and extremely well-done.The final scenes will strike some as too sappy or manipulative, but I though the effect of the entire undertaking was profoundly beautiful, especially the ending which brings everything together in a bittersweet fashion that never struck me as too sentimental, too apparent, or too conventional.Hats off to Tim Burton, for this was one of the best of 2003, and without a doubt his best film since EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.",5,Burton's best since SCISSORHANDS,1090454400,"07 22, 2004",2004,2298,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'been', 'lambasted', 'numerous', 'times', 'past', 'only', 'caring', 'visuals', 'having', 'characters', 'are', 'nothing', 'caricatures', 'case', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'having', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'excuse', 'segue', 'exciting', 'visual.Uh', 'more', 'heart', 'soul', 'many', 'films', 'namely', 'EDWARD', 'SCISSORHANDS', 'topic', 'discussion', 'today', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'think', 'one', 'tear', 'eye', 'one', 'extremely', 'beautiful', 'emotionally', 'visually', 'one', 'bittersweet', 'truth', 'humanity', 'enveloping', 'completely', 'fantastical', 'world', 'same', 'time.I', 'saw', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'first', 'time', 'last', 'night', 'ai', ""n't"", 'gon', 'forget', 'time', 'soon', 'story', 'son', 'played', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'father', 'played', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'life', 'son', 'birth', 'nothing', 'telling', 'same', 'blown-up', 'stories', 'again', 'again', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'result', 'never', 'being', 'close', 'son', 'never', 'being', 'able', 'properly', 'communicate', 'people', 'general', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'man', 'blowing', 'up', 'truth', 'due', 'unconscious', 'dissatisfaction', 'settling', 'down', 'giving', 'up', 'freedom', 'youth', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'things.He', 'spins', 'yarns', '15', 'tall', 'giants', 'witches', 'werewolves', 'tuna-sized', 'catfish', 'bank', 'robberies', 'mysterious', 'towns', 'circuses', 'Korean', 'war', 'Siamese', 'twins', 'son', 'sick', 'hearing', 'just', 'father', 'tell', 'truth', 'particularly', 'humorless', 'even', 'father', 'deathbed.The', 'stories', 'are', 'shown', 'incredible', 'often', 'visually', 'stunning', 'flashbacks', 'quixotic', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'young', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'was', 'very', 'satisfied', 'see', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'still', 'using', 'predominantly', 'non-CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'CGI', 'were', 'tangible', 'extremely', 'well-done.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'will', 'strike', 'too', 'sappy', 'manipulative', 'effect', 'entire', 'undertaking', 'was', 'profoundly', 'beautiful', 'especially', 'ending', 'everything', 'together', 'bittersweet', 'fashion', 'never', 'struck', 'too', 'sentimental', 'too', 'apparent', 'too', 'conventional.Hats', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'one', 'best', '2003', 'doubt', 'best', 'film', 'EDWARD', 'SCISSORHANDS']",N/A

Whether its the witch with the glass eye or Danny DeVito as the little circus man (he fits right in) or the Giant, the characters are larger than life and are very creative.  In Big Fish, all of the characters are pretty central to the plot (in a way) which was another plus.  All of the girls I went to the movie with were crying by the end.  It was both fun and emotional at the same time.  This was an extremely well done movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.

Next to ""The Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King"" it was one of the quickest movies that I have ever seen, and also one of the movies that I did not want to end. This movie had so much to like, that a shorter list would be the list of things that were bad about it.  I saw ""Big Fish"" in Manhattan while it was still in limited release, and now I am waiting to see it again when it expands. And don't listen to the MPAA rating. This movie should have been rated PG- it is not good for all audiences. but certainly for children with there parents.Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom. Bloom likes to tell the many stories of his life, but his stories are false, and he says that they are real, much to the dismay of his son Will, who wants to find out who his father really is, and what happened in his past. Will may get that chance, however, when Edward's wife Sandra calls him and tells him that his father is dying. Will goes to his parents house right away with his preganant wife Josephine, where Will demands to know who his father is. Over the course of Will's visit, we the veiwer hear about Edward's stories. We hear the story of how he and his childhood friends went into the house of a ""witch"" who supposdly has an eye that if you look into it, you find out how you die. We hear the story about Edward's meeting with a giant named Karl. He then leaves the town that he grew up in, and while attending a circus he finds his true love. In a special shot where everything freezes where it was, including things that are in mid-air, we see Edward meeting Young Sandra. The owner of the circus makes a deal with him. For every month that Edward works for him, he will get one piece of infomation about Sandra. But my favorite story is the story about the famed poet Norther Winslow. It comes up so fast, and it's so hilarious because it's the last thing that you would expect happen. Winslow is played by Steve Buscemi, who is a brilliant actor who you see everywhere. You've probally seen him in ""Ghost World"", ""Big Daddy"", ""Fargo,"" and many other films.Tim Burton directed ""Big Fish"" and I can't think of another director that could have made this movie perfectly. The man who produced ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and ""James and the Giant Peach."" If you are a fan of Tim Burton, you'll love ""Big Fish."" It is filmed in the usual Burton style. It is a strange movie, but very realistic. It is hilarious at times, and then full of heart at others. The only other movies that came out this fall that contained those elements were ""Something's Gotta Give,"" and ""Matchstick Men,"" but the stories from all three of these movies combined are complety different and have nothing to do with the other, except for the elements that create the genre. ""Big Fish,"" was simply a great movie, and it is a movie that I have never seen anything like. Even the acting was brilliant. I really like Ewan McGregor. I liked him in ""Moulin Rouge,"" I liked him in ""Down with Love,"" I liked him the last two Star Wars movies, and I liked him in ""Big Fish."" All of the other cast members were great but I do think that McGregor deserves an Oscar nod for this. If ""Big Fish"" was nominated for an Oscar, I believe that it has a strong chance of winning. I really hope this review makes it to amazon so I could stress the fact to people that ""Big Fish"" is one of the best movies of the year.ENJOY!Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference.Big Fish is also one my top 25 list.

The movie itself is like looking into a story book, or a mythology text.  The stories are so fascinating, so unbelievable that the viewer is immediately sucked in.Tim Burton did a superb job directing the film, creating a nostalgic, almost other-wordly look at the life story of Edward Bloom.  The acting was spectacular as well.  Ewan McGregor captured the young charasmatic Edward, and Albert Finney (although he spends the majority of time in a hospital bed) portrayed a very convincing older Edward.  Billy Crudup gave a good performance as Will, Edward's son.  Unfortunately Jessica Lange, a wonderful actress, was relegated to a small role in the film, and did not get as much face time as she deserved.  Her younger self, played by Alison Lohman, received more screen time, and she proved herself to be a strong young actor with a bright future.  Another note on the casting: there were many notable smaller roles played by well-known actors.  Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito, and Helena Bonham Carter added great depth in their small, yet very important roles.The beauty of _Big Fish_ is how it portrays love and family relationships.

I went to see the film with some friends this afternoon. Much to my surprise I loved the movie from the wonderful casting of Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Helena Bonham Carter to the vibrant colors of the film. Billy Crudup plays Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney) estranged son Will who comes home because Edward is dying. Will wants to try to learn the truth about his father because his father had a reputation for telling tall stories. He wants to get to know his father on a personal level. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel (another book I need to read now that I have seen the film version), director Tim Burton weaves a tale that weaves back and forth from the present moment/reality to the past/fictional(?). Tim does a wonderful job of melding the past and present together. I never thought that Helena Bonham Carter was remotely attractive but I have to admit that she looked beautiful as Jenny, a friend from Edward's past. Alison Lohman looked convincingly as a young Sandra. She did look like Jessica Lange but younger. I loved Matthew McGory as the gentle giant Karl as well as the Chinese twins Ada and Arlene Tai as Ping and Jing. I didn't really think that Billy Crudup had much depth (maybe the depth of a dixie cup) as Will. I guess Tim could have cast someone much worse than Billy, like Billy Zane for example. Otherwise the rest of the ensemble cast in the movie put in outstanding performances. I also loved Steve Buscemi's character Norther Winslow and his transformation which I won't give away. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Big Fish"". There wasn't a single moment in the movie that I didn't enjoy.

The good news is, it's WAY better than that hunk-a-junk.  The bad news is, BIG FISH ain't exactly Best Picture material.  I guess this isn't such horrible news, but I was expecting a whole lot more out of it, that's for sure.BIG FISH is essentially two movies: one telling the story of Edward Bloom's life, and the other telling of his son coming to terms with his father as Edward's dying.  This part of the movie I felt failed slightly; I could just never get all that emotionally involved with any of the characters.  It spent too much time on this part, as well.  Or maybe they should've made the movie a good 15-20 minutes longer, and thrown in a little more character development.  A lot more, actually; especially for Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman's character.  I felt no emotion whatsoever when she and Edward Bloom finally got together.  Edward's life story feels very episodic.  I know, I know, they're flashbacks after all.  But none of it felt fluid, and I felt myself longing for more of it.  Perhaps the thing that most surprised me was that it was lacking explanation.  I feel very strange saying this, given that it's a Tim Burton movie, and some of the biggest joys in his movies are those which are never explained.  But nevertheless, the random fantasy didn't mix very well with the other, realistic half of the story.OK, now on to the good.  Ewan McGregor is superb as the young Edward Bloom, as is Albert Finney as the aged Edward.  The rest of the cast does very well, too.

804632,A26SV90ILK5BNO,B0001GOH6Q,Ethan,"[1, 1]","Over the course of his career, Tim Burton has established himself as one of Hollywood's leading directors. His fantastic, often dark and macabre visions are combined with his knack for telling compelling stories that audiences relate to. In his adaptation of Dan Wallace's novel, Big Fish, he puts forth an unusually lighter film that is arguably his most personal.The film begins with the elder Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) speaking about the day of his son Will's (Billy Crudup) birth. While his wife was busy giving birth, Edward was out catching the largest, uncatchable fish that you can imagine. Will, now grown up, struggles with his father's penchant for telling ""Tall Tales"" and claims that he has no idea who his father really is. Edward continues to tell the fantastical story of his growing up, and the events that lead to him meeting is wife.During this time, Burton employs small flashbacks, vignettes that show each of Bloom's stories, with Ewan McGregor portraying the younger Edward. Burton's visual aesthetic gives these stories a Southern Gothic flair that makes them each seem just a bit beyond reality.Will continue's to struggle with his father's tales, claiming that it is impossible to know who his father really is. This causes a three year rift in their relationship that doesn't end until Will receives the news that his father has had a life-threatening stroke. When Will comes to the ailing Edward's hospital bed, he realizes that his father's life has been defined by the stories he tells. With the realization, he begins to tie up the ends of his father's tales, repairing their broken relationship.This is probably Tim Burton's deepest emotional movie. Each character is given a strong arch, allowing Burton's visual pyrotechnics to be matched by emotional revelations that are equally spectacular. The tall tales lend themselves to the fairy tale style that the film takes on.

From the Danny Elfman music score to the fairy tale-esque imagery and quirky characters that populate his films, Burton's films standout. Having said that, all the elements are here , a somewhat fantastical tall tale, great actors and beautiful scenes. And yet all these ingredients really didnt work for me. Instead this film became a Tim Burton by numbers film that sticks to every tired cliche he has.The movie is about a young man who has listened to his father (played by Albert Finney) tell unbelievable tales all his life. At his wedding he finds he has reached his limit as his father steals the attention from he and his new bride to tell the story of the whopper fish he caught. What ensues is a series of flashbacks where a young father(played by Ewan McGregor) goes through a series of tales so impossible to believe that they border on the ridiculous. Towards the film's climax father and son come full circle and have an understanding of each other.The cast here are okay. Albert Finney does a fine job as does Danny Devito.

804637,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,B0001GOH6Q,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[2, 2]","Based on a book by author Daniel Wallace, Tim Burton's Big Fish embodies many components of a typical Burton film--fantasy, odd characters, imagery, mystical settings--yet, in this instance, it does it with a Southern flavor. The film's main crux is a father-son struggle, and we see them struggle between what is a tall tale and what is truth, what is fact and what is fiction, and what is reality and what is exaggerated. The son, Will (Billy Crudup), has had to listen to his father's tall tales for years, and he believes that this has created a rift between he and his father for years, and that he doesn't know who his ""real"" father is behind all these fantastical tales. Edward Bloom, who reminisces into the past with tall tales, has many imaginative adventures, including a walk through supposedly haunted woods, an encounter with a witch and a giant man, joining a traveling circus, and trying to get the girl of his dreams.Tim Burton's capacity to create symbolism, eccentric characters, colorful scenery and depth in this story help to make it an exceptional film. One of the more telling points of the film is when Bloom, as a youngster, goes through a dark path to find the town of Spector, a sort of Utopia, where everyone stays because they never want to leave. Bloom decides that it isn't right for him to be there, and, while leaving, he promises a young girl that he will come back to the town sometime in the future when he's ""meant to"" come back. While here, he also meets a struggling poet (Steve Buschemi), who he later winds up helping rob a bank. Later in the story, he realizes why he must come back to this town.What I also enjoyed about this film is that there wasn't just an emphasis on plot and imagery; there is also some depth. Some life lessons that the son must learn are to appreciate those close to you and to have faith in something that seems far-fetched or implausible. When learning of his father's decline in health, the son attempts to tie those bonds that have kept them at a distance. He learns that truth and fantasy are closer than he thinks.This is a unique film, with some beautiful scenery, exceptional casting, and interesting storytelling.",4,Imaginative Burton Tale,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2190,"['Based', 'book', 'author', 'Daniel', 'Wallace', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Big', 'Fish', 'embodies', 'many', 'components', 'typical', 'Burton', 'film', 'fantasy', 'odd', 'characters', 'imagery', 'mystical', 'settings', 'yet', 'instance', 'Southern', 'flavor', 'film', 'main', 'crux', 'father-son', 'struggle', 'see', 'struggle', 'tall', 'tale', 'what', 'truth', 'what', 'fact', 'what', 'fiction', 'what', 'reality', 'what', 'exaggerated', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'had', 'listen', 'father', 'tall', 'tales', 'years', 'created', 'rift', 'father', 'years', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'real', 'father', 'fantastical', 'tales', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'who', 'past', 'tall', 'tales', 'many', 'imaginative', 'adventures', 'including', 'walk', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'woods', 'encounter', 'witch', 'giant', 'man', 'joining', 'traveling', 'circus', 'trying', 'get', 'girl', 'dreams.Tim', 'Burton', 'capacity', 'create', 'symbolism', 'eccentric', 'characters', 'colorful', 'scenery', 'depth', 'story', 'help', 'make', 'exceptional', 'film', 'One', 'more', 'telling', 'points', 'film', 'when', 'Bloom', 'youngster', 'dark', 'path', 'find', 'town', 'Spector', 'sort', 'Utopia', 'where', 'everyone', 'never', 'want', 'leave', 'Bloom', ""n't"", 'right', 'be', 'there', 'leaving', 'young', 'girl', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'town', 'sometime', 'future', 'when', 'meant', 'come', 'back', 'here', 'also', 'struggling', 'poet', 'Steve', 'Buschemi', 'who', 'later', 'up', 'helping', 'rob', 'bank', 'Later', 'story', 'why', 'must', 'come', 'back', 'town.What', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'emphasis', 'plot', 'imagery', 'also', 'depth', 'life', 'lessons', 'son', 'must', 'learn', 'are', 'appreciate', 'close', 'have', 'faith', 'something', 'far-fetched', 'implausible', 'When', 'learning', 'father', 'decline', 'health', 'son', 'tie', 'bonds', 'have', 'kept', 'distance', 'truth', 'fantasy', 'are', 'closer', 'unique', 'film', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'exceptional', 'casting', 'interesting', 'storytelling']",N/A

I really thought this was a major contender with other great films of 2003/04 such as Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Mystic River. Althought, I was astonished to see that Big Fish was only up for one Academy Award this year, and it was only for scene creation; not for Movie of the Year or something along those lines.I will be writing this review assuming that you know the plot of this film.Tim Burton is a pretty popular guy in the movie business. Having done other movies such as Big Fish such as The Night Before Christmas, he is known for making different and unique tales exciting and enjoyable. Big Fish is no acception. The actors all create interesting and meaningful characters that really exciten you as you follow the journey that they persue. Particularly  found in the character of Edward Bloom, many/most of the characters are funny, interesting, and exciting. Not too many movies matched up to this character development this year.What makes this movie so good is the fact that nothing even close to this kind of thing has been created before. This movie is one of the most interesting and different movies to ever be made. It has a lot of traits that only independant films possess like the extremist story line and the outlandish characters and scenes, but it really does teach you a lesson and it does, more importantly, make a huge mark in your mind; comparing other films to Big Fish is almost impossible because there's nothing to compare it to.

Now that may sound like an oxymoron for a Tim Burton all-stops-out fantasy gig, but for those who don't get lightheaded at the mention of this talented director's name of ilk of films, this journey has a lot of fine surprises.  Yes, this is another fantasy movie, but this time the fantasy embroiders a tender and (and all too frequent) trying examination of a father/son relationship.  Young Will Bloom is called home to Alabama (where his father is dying) from Paris where he and his pregnant wife have fled to get away from his distant father who has only conversed with Will through tall tales ('lies') to the point that the schism produced makes Will realize that he doesn't know his father at all.  Burton can't resist making visual all the tall tales so often repeated by Edward Bloom - stories of his preposterous birth, the way he met his wife, the journey to escape the little town through magic forests and 'heavenly' cites with his comrade the giant, his employment by sideshows, and his encounters with witches, odd balls, and huge fish.  These parts of the story plead patience, so overblown and non-edited they endlessly appear, but in the end the reason for telling them finds home in the coming together of the father and son in a way that leaves not a dry eye in the audience.  Burton wisely has a cast of professionals that help make this story work:  Ewan McGregor is the young Ed Bloom and Albert Finney is the elder form of the man, Billy Crudup is the son Will, Jessica Lange the Mother (Alison Lohman is her younger self), and the assorted characters are spun by the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Robert Guillaume, and an especially fine Matthew McGrory as Karl the Giant.

Fans from all over have flocked to go see this movie when it was only released in limited theaters.  But now, it's open nation wide and everyone can have a chance to see this movie.  But is it worth the wait...and the cost of your money?Albert Finney plays Ed Bloom; a man who has spent most of his whole life telling stories to everyone he meets.  Everyone seems to get a big kick out of the stories except for his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup).  Ed becomes very sick and this illness causes Will to come back to his father.  Will then struggles with his father to seperate fact from fiction and find out who his father really is.  The movie is told mostly through Ed's stories and Ewan McGregor plays the young Ed Bloom.  Jessica Lange stars as Ed's wife, Sandra Bloom, while Alison Lohman plays the young Sandra Bloom throughout the stories.After seeing this movie, I was just in awe at how incredible this film was.  The movie is very emotional and definitely not for everyone.  Big Fish starts out kinda confusing and almost a mess.  The movie starts right away in the stories and your swept into them with no plot and wonder, ""What's going on?""  The one reason why the movie still has audiences watching and not leaving, despite the flaws, is because of the visuals.  It's a good thing Tim Burton directed because to be honest, I don't think any other director could pour enough imagination and heart into this movie like Tim Burton did.  Through the visuals, one can see that Mr. Burton cares deeply for this movie and it's characters.  The visuals can go from being creepy (very much Burton style), to being simply beautiful.  The movie has excelled in it's breath taking appearance.The acting is so-so except for two that stand out among the others.  Mr Finney is extraordinary as the father who is relentless in telling his stories.  This is a difficult character to play because this is a man who likes to be the center of attention but yet he has to be a character that you still care for even though he is selfish in his ways.  Mr. Finney hits the character right on, and you find yourself loving Ed Bloom and always wanting him to be on the screen, much like the other characters wanted him in the film because of his stories.  The other standout is Mr. Crudup.  His performance of the son who can't stand his father or his stories is so human that you feel like you know this guy.  Mr. Crudup is very careful in his acting in making sure he doesn't overact during the emotional scenes but yet, stay human and provide us with warm comfort as we can understand and relate to why he would feel sick of his father and his stories.Big Fish consist mostly of Ed's stories and at the final ending is where everything comes together.  Throughout the entire movie there's not much of a plot, but it keeps you there because of the visuals, and then at the end is where everything comes together.  The ending is so pleasing and glamourous that it makes the entire movie worthwhile.  The ending is what truely turns this film from a good movie into a great movie.  It's so charitable and memorable of the importance of a father/son relationship that it had me crying.  Everything was tied together and I found myself cheering and clapping at how incredible this film was.Big Fish is definielty worth the money.  This is a film about a father and a son and the relationship between the two.  Though the movie begins like a man stumbling through the fog, it ends like a man standing in a field of beautifully grown yellow flowers, simply marvolous.

Burton is the true authentic storyteller whose imagination has overcome the standards. From Beetlejuice through Batman I, The sleepy hallow to this trip plenty of visual elegance and arresting and captivating images all along the movie.Supported by a smart script , it faces the bitter relationship between father and son. The father to my mind represents the same Burton, where imagination and reality are blended, so the limits between what's the official story and what was dreamed is difficult to definite.His son grows surrounded of legends and half truths and when his father to just one step from dying. He decides to rebuilt all his father's life trying to find and establish the truth from the legend. The fish and the wedding ring is a special life lesson that will be revealed at the end. But the kinetic camera and the ravishing journey behind the great love of his father, the impressive sequence with the huge yellow narcissus carpet will be the mute witness for the materialization of that expected love.Burton through this extraordinary metaphor, and visibly inspire by the magic realism -Think in Alejo Carpentier and Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez-, invites us to think and reflect about the love for the little things, to see far beyond the meaning of the things by themselves and the importance of the imagination as the true essence of a better existence.

Welsh ""starmer welshmeister""","[2, 3]","Another artistic and commercial failure such as ""Mars Attacks!"" or ""Planet of the Apes,"" and Tim Burton might have seceded into non-being.However, let it be known that in Burton's latest film ""Big Fish,"" he has fashioned perhaps his ultimate achievement. In this, his 11th major motion picture, Burton has deftly interspooled fantasy with reality as never before, creating a film that sparkles with mythological glamour.Whether it's the supposed halting of time when true love is stumbled upon, landing that slippery belle with a band of gold in the river of fortune or assisting 14-foot giants in their quest for realizing their equally-as-giant ambitions, ""Big Fish"" is a work of utter resplendence.Are the improbable events that roll off of Edward Bloom's graying tongue simply tall-tale rubbish of a life that might have been, or is there something more? Who was this man behind the inventive veil? The theme of the film revolves around this riddle, as dad-to-be Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) sits bedside with his dying father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), in order to sift fact from fiction before it is too late.In flashback, Will Bloom recalls the stories his father told him, trying to relay them just as he remembers. We hear of a shriveled witch with a black patch covering up her right eye that, when stared into, will reveal one's means of death and the heaven-like town of Spectre, an isolated township that, when accessed by a major road and big business, wisps into a state of dilapidation.Not to mention Karl, the aforementioned giant, played wonderfully by Matthew McGrory, who gobbles up entire cornfields overnight and has driven the townsfolk to talk of murdering the behemoth.If not for the helping hand of Edward Bloom, Karl very well could have wound up a fictional afterthought, a spooky subject of campfire make-believe. Further still, there is the tale of a once-great poet whose creative reservoirs go dry all of a sudden, only to find his calling in the least likely of professions - thanks to Edward, and so many others.By the conclusion of the film, the viewer cannot help but come to the realization that although a lot of what Edward says is not completely true, a great deal of his farfetched stories are closer to the truth than one can ever know.The bottom line is the people within his tales are indeed flesh and blood, and their lives were undoubtedly touched by Edward's selflessness. No, Edward's fib of the factual was not a reflection of his need for attention. Rather, its purpose lies in breathing imaginative vigor into those individuals he had the honor of befriending along his life journey.",5,`Big Fish' is a heartfelt magic carpet ride,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2635,"['artistic', 'commercial', 'failure', 'such', 'Mars', 'Attacks', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'might', 'have', 'seceded', 'non-being.However', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'Burton', 'latest', 'film', 'Big', 'Fish', 'fashioned', 'perhaps', 'ultimate', 'achievement', '11th', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'Burton', 'deftly', 'interspooled', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'never', 'creating', 'film', 'mythological', 'glamour.Whether', 'supposed', 'halting', 'time', 'when', 'true', 'love', 'stumbled', 'landing', 'slippery', 'belle', 'band', 'gold', 'river', 'fortune', 'assisting', '14-foot', 'giants', 'quest', 'realizing', 'equally-as-giant', 'ambitions', 'Big', 'Fish', 'work', 'utter', 'resplendence.Are', 'improbable', 'events', 'roll', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'graying', 'tongue', 'simply', 'tall-tale', 'rubbish', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'there', 'something', 'more', 'Who', 'was', 'man', 'inventive', 'veil', 'theme', 'film', 'riddle', 'dad-to-be', 'Will', 'Bloom', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'bedside', 'dying', 'father', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'order', 'sift', 'fact', 'fiction', 'too', 'late.In', 'flashback', 'Will', 'Bloom', 'stories', 'father', 'told', 'trying', 'relay', 'just', 'hear', 'shriveled', 'witch', 'black', 'patch', 'covering', 'up', 'right', 'eye', 'when', 'stared', 'will', 'reveal', 'one', 'means', 'death', 'heaven-like', 'town', 'Spectre', 'isolated', 'township', 'when', 'accessed', 'major', 'road', 'big', 'business', 'wisps', 'state', 'dilapidation.Not', 'mention', 'Karl', 'aforementioned', 'giant', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Matthew', 'McGrory', 'who', 'up', 'entire', 'cornfields', 'overnight', 'driven', 'townsfolk', 'talk', 'murdering', 'behemoth.If', 'not', 'helping', 'hand', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Karl', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'wound', 'up', 'fictional', 'afterthought', 'spooky', 'subject', 'campfire', 'make-believe', 'Further', 'still', 'tale', 'once-great', 'poet', 'creative', 'reservoirs', 'go', 'dry', 'sudden', 'only', 'find', 'calling', 'least', 'likely', 'professions', 'thanks', 'Edward', 'so', 'many', 'others.By', 'conclusion', 'film', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'come', 'realization', 'lot', 'what', 'Edward', 'not', 'completely', 'true', 'great', 'deal', 'farfetched', 'stories', 'are', 'closer', 'truth', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'know.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'people', 'tales', 'are', 'indeed', 'flesh', 'blood', 'lives', 'were', 'undoubtedly', 'touched', 'Edward', 'selflessness', 'No', 'Edward', 'fib', 'factual', 'was', 'not', 'reflection', 'need', 'attention', 'Rather', 'purpose', 'lies', 'breathing', 'imaginative', 'vigor', 'individuals', 'had', 'honor', 'befriending', 'life', 'journey']",N/A

Throughout his life, he meets giants, werewolves, an idyllic town by the name of Spectre, a witch, a pair of conjoined twins in China, and more importantly, the woman that he would later spend the rest of his life with.So unusual is his life, that his only son thinks that his father is weaving a cocoon around himself by eluding reality. Instead of accepting those stories as facts, the son gradually distances himself from his father, both unable to see eye to eye.There is no separating myth from the man when it comes to Edward Bloom. We are not told which part of the story is not true, but we are led to believe that some of Edward's stories are exaggerated, for he is a great storyteller. Ewan McGregor puts in a superb performance as the young Edward Bloom, carefree, adventurous, and headstrong. One of the best scenes in this movie would be the scene where he met his future wife in the circus, and time came to a standstill. Billy Crudup was effective in his portrayal of the practical son, who refuses to believe his father's stories. Jessica Lange's small but crucial role helps us to believe the love Edward and his wife had for each other.Considering that the movie relied on the element of surprise as its stronghold, I was disappointed with its predictability.

There'll be enough people giving away the story without me adding to it. I'll just say that I was so impressed by the fact that the special effects were great, for my taste. They weren't the kind of knock-your-socks-off full-tilt guns and explosions they seem to just throw in for the hell of it, and that wouldn't have been appropriate, anyway. There is great subtlety and beauty in this movie, and the director kept this movie relatively clean. I am very grateful for this. Of course, for me, this is all gravy, due to the fact that there is actually meat to this movie in the form of a well-written, if complex, story that's beautifully resolved at the end. I love sentimentality, because I'm not afraid to cry, so this kind of movie is right up my alley.What is it about members of the former British empire and their ability to do American Southern accents so well? This is nothing new, of course; I remember  Dame Elizabeth Taylor in Faulkner's ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". Speaking as a mere Oklahoman, today's crop of British actors do equally as well! It's hard to believe that actors McGregor and Finney weren't both from 'Bama! I think an Oscar needs to go to their voice coach, because he/she did an excellent job! And I must say that Ewan McGregor redeems himself where I'm concerned by not butchering any more of Elton John's music or even singing at all. What he does is great comedic acting, and he was a joy to watch, as was Albert Finney, whom, frankly, I thought was dead! The rest of the supporting cast was, well, eclectic, to say the least and fun to watch.Finally, let me say that they feature the most beautiful red Charger I've ever seen. I hadn't seen one in years, and this movie made me almost want one again.I can see myself buying this film when it's out on DVD or video and just watching it over and over again. I can't say that about a lot of films that's out these days, either.

It was perfect as long as the son believed in the stories the father was telling him all the time, that is to say as long as Father Christmas really was a childhood hero. But older age came and those stories sounded all silly, even sillier and sillier and they led to a complete break between the two, the father and the son, till the father came to the point of departing from this life. The son and his wife came back and he was confronted to the stories again. But one day when he was sorting out some old documents of his father's for his mother he came across a strange deed that showed the existence of an estate under the name of his father. And he went there and discovered that this estate had some tremendous reality and that the witch of the old stories was the young girl from some other old story who had become a piano teacher and had benefited from this estate. She sure was in  love with the father but the father was faithful to his wife. The son then discovers that all the stories were just embellished true stories. The Siamese Chinese twin women were in fact true  Chinese twins though not Siamese. And an epiphany takes place. When the son was keeping watch over his father at the hospital one night, the father called him and the son understood the father was asking him to tell him a bedside story to put him to sleep, the big sleep. And the son is inspired to tell him his own version of his father's embellished stories and that story enables the father to go to his long sleep with all the characters of his own stories. And when the funeral arrives, the son, his wife and his mother can only see with their own eyes that all the characters of these stories are true people. But in the meantime some miracle had happened. The son on the command from his dying father had taken him away from the hospital to the river where he had put him back into the water, as if the father was only a captured big fish living among the humans and waiting for this last minute to recapture his true nature and swim away down the river where he had come from. That's when the film could have turned grotesque or just funny strange. But Tim Burton is a genius of the paranormal and how to make it look so natural that we are obliged to believe in it and to go back to our infancy, when we believed wonderful stories full of unbelievable wonders that we could only believe in deep in our hearts because they were so beautiful.

Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and Nightmare Before Christmas are great examples of that. He's an expert at bringing fables to life and taking strange, exotic, and deeply flawed characters to the screen and presenting them in a way that allows a mass audience accept them. In fact Tim Burton celebrates these characters, and that enthusiasm is fantastic.Then there are the Tim Burton movies that are not as personal to him and seem to miss the enthusiasm and zeal that make his great movies great. Planet of the Apes is a great recent example of that type of film.Big Fish is a mixture of both types of Burton films. When Big Fish goes into fantasy mode the movie shines and is immensly enjoyable and interesting. The characters in this world are wild and full of life. When the movie reverts back to reality, the movie deflates and almost seems bored and tired. To be honest, I believe it is a reflection of the filmmaker.

804673,A1U49W4Z6PDLSU,B0001GOH6Q,Jeani T.,"[2, 4]","I first heard this movie was boring, but I honestly think this is because people are so watered-down nowadays with easy-come entertainment that they miss real literature. Now it takes a little thinking; this movie is absolutely saturated with symbolism. It is originally a book, good sign, but it's also Tim Burton's portrayal that really makes this movie shine. Coupled with Danny Elfman's score, and excellent performances by McGregor (I used to not like him because of Star Wars but now I love him) and Bonham-Carter, this is not only a must-see but a must-keep.This story comes from the perspective of a son who has become absolutely sick of his father's ""tall tales."" Most of the movie consists of the father's ""flashbacks,"" but unlike most movies who tried pulling this type of thing off, meshes it very nicely with the present day so that themes, contrasts, etc. can match nicely.Now, at the end of the movie, what we realize is not the intrinsic value of tall tales but that it is really your perception of your own life, rather than incidents that happen, that truly define it. Course, I could just say that, but it is so much more effective in the unique, beautiful manner that Ewan McGregor's story tells it.

Critics seemed to take more of a liking to the foreighn film Barbarian Invasion. Since both came out around the same time and both are about an old man's last hours with his family. So most critics gave Big Fish lower ratings because they liked The Barbarian Invasion more. Some critics did notice it and appreciate it a lot but not enough did.Meanwhile I think Big Fish deserved the sort of appreciation that Forest Gump got. Hell for me it made me feel the way I did when I first saw Forest Gump as well. It's touching, uplifting, funny, romantic and highly imaginative. The performances  are great as well. Ewan McGregor is fantastic as young Edward Bloom and Albert Finny is equally great as old Edward Bloom. Billy Crudup (Almost Famous), Jessica Lange (Tootsie), Danny Devito, Helen Bohen Carter (Fight Club) and Steve Buscemi (Ghost World) are all good in supporting roles as well. Critic Roger Ebert said that Tim Burton does better work when he focuses more on a story than effects like with Sleepy Hollow and Edward. He makes it sound like Big Fish doesn't focus more on the story when it does. It's all story and all heart. Burton isn't George Lucas, he can make a good movie even without eye popping effects. He proved that with EdWood and I think he proved that with Big Fish too.

The movie opened in cinemas in Australia officially on February 5th 2004.I read the 'Big Fish' book during January and enojoyed it. I thought Tim could find some fancy elements that seem to have become his trademarks. I was right. He has created a brilliant picture for Ewan. From reports Ewan is very proud of this film. I would be too if I were him. Tim Burton's movies to me, seem so dark and unusual. I've seen most of his films and for most of the time, that would be a fair assessment of them. But I can't say this for 'Big Fish'. 'Big Fish' seems truely magical, lovely and nice. As if it came straight out of a book of fairy tales, and each page were sprinkled with fairy dust that warms everyone's heart.The script was excellently written. So many wonderful, very beautiful lines. The photography was so clear and sharp, one can watch the story unfold with ease. It is hard to take your eyes off the screen, the results are just so scrumptious, you shouldn't reach the end of the film and not feel fulfilled and enlightened. This movie followed the book closely. Only filling the story in where it felt it needed to. I don't remember a car submerged in water, or even a car drying out in the branches of a tree, but the naked woman (mermaid) Ewan McGregor's character Edward Bloom sees in the water, I remember vividly. I'm glad the nudity didn't detract from the movie. It's all in the book briefly, as it is in the film. In these underwater scenes I couldn't help but think of 'Splash'. Although the woman in this still seemed to have human legs not a mermaid's tail like is usually the case with mermaids.I also liked Allison Lohman's role in this film even though it was somewhat brief it was effective. She was the quintessential beauty of Edward's life. I knew from the previews to this movie I would love it, but one of those reasons was her. Some character's just stand out sometimes and she did. A very well cast film, filled with brilliant performances to bring a world to life. Ewan goes about his role with sheer ease and style. He is a natural. A genius at expressing his emotions. He makes it look so easy. At first I thought it didn't seem to be a terribly physical role for Ewan, but he soon changed that. Ewan is brave! I write that like I'm surprised. I shouldn't be. Ewan can do anything. Everybody loves Edward Bloom (like the flower).Whereever Edward turns his hand to, everything opens to full bloom in a warm glow of radiant sunshine. He makes anything seem possible, no matter how hard it may seem at first. Then just when you think 'Big Fish' is a simple little story, it has underlying depth to it, amid the humor. It brances out in exraordinary ways.Two of my favorite scenes were in the field of daffodils (not a 'Field Of Dreams'), with Allison. I don't think I've heard many other lines more beautiful then those of Ewan to Jessica. It was an extraordinary moment. I wonder how many other people propose to the ones they love, without knowing much about them. Instead just relying on a feeling and the rest of their lives to discover someone, who makes their heart's sour with inexplicable delight. But then I think babies are created with just as much out of a feeling of love, not knowing how things will really turn out eventually, but somehow it does. Must be the same with marriage. That's very special.A worthwhile movie experience. In keeping with the book that Daniel Wallance dedicated to his own father, but made even better. My love for this movie keeps growing. I hope to see this movie again. If only to wrap my thoughts around all the characters.I really wanted to see this movie because I heard my special Ewan friend Gabrielle had a chance to be in it. Unfortunately she was overlooked. The producers will be sorry. I know she would have fitted in well, If I was making a movie, I'd take her in a second. Honestly I would. There were plenty of opportunity for crowd scenes, so for every Ewan fan able to be involved in the shoot, consider yourself very lucky. Your time shall come Gabrielle! You will show them and they will be sorry they didn't pick you. Lilia, one of the special girls able to meet and have a photo with Ewan McGregor, was one lucky girl! I hope she enjoyed the movie too! I'm so glad I got to chat and congratulate Lilia on her special time with Ewan. 'Big Fish' is sure to remain a favorite for many more people then usual because some got opportunities one doesn't usually get. Well done everyone with a special Ewan or 'Big Fish' story. You all make 'Big Fish' bigger and better then ever. I read the book to see what Gabrielle was missing out on. I also get the CD to complete my movie experience. I shall hold this Ewan movie esspecially close to my heart because I loved it, but also for Gabrielle's sake too. Keep trying something will bite soon, and it will be better then a 'Big Fish'. But until that time, it will be special to me because of Gabrielle.",5,Catch 'Big Fish' before it swims away,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,5055,"['first', 'saw', 'film', '1st', 'February', '2004',

A son thinks his father is a blowhard who can't be honest with him. Edward Bloom (Albert Finney in a kind of Southern accent) loves to tell stories that he perhaps embellishes and exaggerates, but maybe not that much. There may be more than a kernel of truth in those tales. But, at any rate, this causes a rift and separation between the father and his son William Bloom (played by Billy Crudup, a frequent Broadway player). The senior Edward Bloom as a youth is played by Ewan McGregor. He's a winning actor you can't help liking because of his smile and his openness. As a youngster Edward Bloom saw his death in a witch's eye.The movie is part fantasy and part realism. Along the way there are monsters, giants, man-wolves, a witch, an enormous catfish, a phantom town, and other amazing sights.Danny De Vito plays a circus ringmaster, Steve Buscemi plays one of Bloom's neighbors who is living in a dreamlike utopian town, and Helena Bonham Carter plays a witch and a woman who is in love with Will. Jessica Lang plays Finney's adoring wife.The movie creates a pleasant mood, a fairy tale-like atmosphere. It has an upbeat ending, and I don't know why exactly but the movie reminded me of Forrest Gump; this film has that same kind of romantic and sentimental flavor.It was directed by Tim Burton who often deals in fantasies and oddball stuff. He's provided some eccentric roles for Johnny Depp. This is a satisfying, pleasant movie. Just don't take it too seriously, and you'll have fun with it.Filmmakers like Burton have a unique opportunity through their medium to present imagery that is bizarre, over-the-top, surreal, dreamlike visuals.

Edward is a constant teller of Tall Tales about himself and his life, and his son is frustrated because that's all he's ever heard from Ol' Dad, and he knows nothing of the real person behind the facade. However, remaining true to form, the dying Edward persists in rehashing his outlandish stories; he finds a new audience in Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard).Any similarity between the two films is perhaps superficial, especially since THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS may be one of the best of 2003, something BIG FISH cannot aspire to. In the former, the son comes to terms with his father by dealing with the health crisis of the present and there are no overt special visual effects. It's poignantly realistic about life and death, or at least to the degree that the director envisions. In BIG FISH, Will must discover his father's essence by delving into the past, and the film's funky visuals are everything. And the Tall Tales are truly tall, as when young Edward parachutes behind enemy lines in the Korean War or, later, is accidentally roped into aiding and abetting a bank robbery. And how about the one where traveling salesman Edward encounters such a deluge of a rainstorm that his car ends marooned in the top of a tree? The problem is that the natures of the yarns are so varied that the overall continuity of the film perhaps suffers. But is there any truth to Edward's improbable stories? Only at the movie's end does it all come together.Albert Finney is suitably crusty as the aged Edward, and Ewan McGregor is engaging as the younger version. The talented Jessica Lange is wasted in the role of Will's mother. Danny DeVito is swell as circus owner Amos. But, the quality of the performances is almost irrelevant as the allure of this quirky film rests with its ""look"".

The story is about a young man played by Billy Crudup who goes to visit his father after hearing he is severely ill. He wants to know who his father really was, not just the stories he was told growing up, which, although fascinating to everyone else, he is tired of hearing. This film dives into every story Billy Crudup's father has to tell, changing scenery and characters enough that it seems like a variety show. This movie has a little bit of everything.

Remington ""John Remington""","[1, 1]","I got a little lost along the wayBut it's just around the corner to the light of day-Bruce SpringsteenComing from a bloodline rife with storytellers, BIG FISH'S concept had me, to quote JERRY MAGUIRE, at hello.Director Tim Burton's latest film dramatizes the efforts of an adult son (Billy Crudup) desperately trying to find the smallest tile of fact in his dying father's (the always excellent Albert Finney as raconteur extraordinaire Edward Bloom) exaggerated life mosaic.As with all of Burton's films, image, mood, atmosphere and flights of fancy weigh far more importantly than honest human connection or cohesive narrative. The film often loses itself in Edward Bloom's wild and wooly fantasies thereby straining not only credulity and verisimilitude but also the audience's emotional investment. This is a film that demands we empathize with every step our protagonists make on their personal odysseys. And that is a trick the self-consciously eccentric Burton has yet to consistently master. As usual Burton oscillates wildly between images of antiseptic suburbia and foggy gothic forests with several colorful Rube Goldberg circus acts randomly interspersed.Fortunately Burton allows his excellent cast- also featuring Jessica Lange, Ewan MacGregor, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito enough sublime moments of acting wizardry to forge the tangible human element.Even though Big Fish sometimes loses us along the way, it does lead us to the light of day in a most satisfying denouement.

There were some parts I didn't quite like, but overall I thought it was a great movie - one of Tim Burton's better movies (way better than Planet of the Apes, by far!).The basic story is that Edward Bloom (young version played by Ewan Mcgregor, old version played by Albert Finney) is a story-teller.  He's always got a tall tale to tell.  He's loved his adventurous life and tells everyone about it whenever he can.  This has driven his son, William (Billy Crudup) crazy over the years.  He feels like he doesn't know who his father is.  The movie takes place during the time when Edward is dying and William has to come to terms with it.  William wants to know who his father really is, but can't seem to get Edward to tell him the ""truth.""  William is frustrated by Edward's tall tales, thinking they're just a bunch of lies.William's young pregnant wife comes with him to visit while Edward is dying, so he starts spinning tales for her about his life story. This is the other half of the movie, where you get to see Edward's life as he is growing up and going on all sorts of crazy adventures.  The flashbacks and stories of Edward's life are so intruging and beautifully filmed.  Edward runs in to all sorts of crazy people including a witch with a glass eye that shows you how you will die, a town where everyone is barefoot and happy, a giant named Karl, siamese twin sisters who sing and all sorts of other interesting characters.  Again, the fantasy scenes of this movie are incredibly moving and visually stunning.The acting was phenominal as well in this movie - I especially enjoyed Ewan McGregor as the adventurous young Edward.  He was completely believeable and created such a fun and interesting character to watch on screen.  Albert Finney was also wonderful as the older Edward, spinning tall tales to anyone who would listen.  Several supporting actors/actresses did a great job as well, especially Jessica Lange as older Edward's wife, Danny DeVito as the eccentric carnival owner, Helena Bonham-Carter as the witch/Jenny from Spectre and so many others.While I did enjoy the film, I didn't quite understand the son, William.  I have relatives who spin tall tales all the time and I find it charming and fun.  William was stuffy and completely unlikeable, even at the end of the movie.  While I thought the acting by Billy Crudup was good, I just plain didn't like the character and didn't really believe that a son would have that much animosity towards his dad just because his dad was a storyteller.Other than that, I thought the movie was wonderful.  I still highly recommend seeing it, it's just a beautiful fun story, despite being a bit of a tear-jerker at some points.  The acting is superb, the music is great, the sets and cinematography are wonderful.

804707,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0001GOH6Q,K. Driscoll,"[8, 9]","Tim Burton's return to genuine film making is a welcome endeavor indeed. Here he creates a film that reminds me of what great film making is all about: fantasy, love and reflecting on the human spirit. I scoffed at a review that compared Big Fish to The Wizard of Oz when Big Fish first came out, but upon viewing it the comparison is really not hyperbolic at all and is actually quite justified. There is a unique carelessness and an innocence that resides perfectly and constantly in both films. To me, both films are truly a breath of fresh air and hope.Big Fish is a book written by Daniel Wallace and is the delightful story of Edward Bloom, who has reached the twilight of his life and surrounds himself with his son, daughter-in-law and his wonderful wife Sandra. Eddie has seemingly lived a fantastic life of lies and exaggerations and his son has grown to call his bluff on more than one occasion. In fact, his son returns not just to possibly say good-bye to his father, but to attempt to get him to spill the beans on the truth of who his old man really is. Eddie of course, stands by his stories and brushes off his son's accusations nonchalantly. Most of the film we see Eddie revisit his life as a whole, seen through only his own stories. How he once befriended a 12 foot man; how he arrived in a town that was paradise, once to early and once too late when he turned it back into paradise again; how he joined the circus for three years so he could find out pieces information once a month from Amos the ringmaster about the girl Eddie was sure would be his wife and how Sandra would believe Eddie to be dead in war but he would return. The stories are full of details that would clearly indicate they are false but sometimes they are just better that way. Eddie is a mythological figure and that is just fine with him and as a viewer it's fine with me as well.Eddie is played by Albert Finney who is in turn mirrored by Eddie's youthful version, the outstanding Ewen MacGregor who once again proves his versatility. Jessica Lange plays the older Sandra and she is played as a youngster by the talented Alison Lohman who carries as much energy and beauty as you could expect for a role with so little dialogue and so much importance. She is a real find and makes you fall in love with her right along with Eddie. Helena Bonham Carter brings her talents to the roles of The Witch and Jenny (or all of the other important women in Eddie's life). Steve Buscemi shows up, which is always a pleasant surprise and of course Amos is played by Danny DeVito who is as enjoyable as ever. The flat Keanu Reeves clone Billy Crudup is perhaps the only drawback, but he is a safe casting call as Eddie's son and does what he can in discovering that his father is exactly what he says he is and more.Let me just add that I believe Big Fish is a family film. I don't see why it shouldn't be rated PG rather than PG-13. The language rises above the prime time television level once, there is blood only in a comedic and romantic fight sequence that has a truly admirable message and there is a women's nude rear displayed briefly and non-sexually. This is not grounds for a PG-13 movie. I would bring a seven year old to see this. In fact, my guess is that the movie was directed at this demographic. When content is not exploitative, it is not really inappropriate. I can't see why Rock Diesel films get PG-13ed when the message is nothing short of ""Kill the bad guys, make a lame joke, drive and crash really cool vehicles and get the dirty chick"". Anyway, Big Fish may be about a guy who is stretching the truth but the characters' hearts couldn't be more firmly in the right place. The scene when Eddie fills an entire field with Sandra's favorite flower and stands in the middle of the field, outside of her window and calls out to her comes to mind. It brings joy to my heart in a way that only a film like The Wizard of Oz can, and a small child should never ever miss that kind of message. Big Fish is a smart film that really generates a ton of emotion and convincing special effects. I don't doubt for a moment that more work went into the effects than money. This film carried a sense of hope, pride, real love, respect, fantasy and the crucial element that films of these tainted times often forget: natural and unforced optimism.Then there is Tim Burton. He is the filmmaker that can put all of these elements together and for the first time tug at your emotions as well. Two things make this film better than Burton's other work. Firstly, it is real and doesn't dwell on being over-stylized and under-dramatized. Secondly, it is pure, clean and full of moments we can all relate too. Tim Burton has made a film that will alienate his older fans who haven't matured like he has, without ""selling out"" (he's done that before) and he has made a film that the whole world can watch, enjoy and discover this unique filmmaker. I'm glad that he saved some of his real film making inspiration for this wonderful little story.",5,Sometimes Fiction is Better than the Truth,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,5030,"['Tim', 'Burton',

When his father falls ill, he returns home with his pregnant wife and tries to get to the truth of the matter when it comes to his father's life.I loved how the story kept going back and forth between the present day and the past.  Burton's imagination is one of the things I love about his films and he didn't cease to amaze me with this project.  Plus, all of the interesting characters brought into the story made the movie even more enjoyable. (My particular favorite was Karl the Giant.)Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor's performances were amazing.  I'm surprised and a bit disappointed that this movie didn't get as much credit as it deserves.  Another aspect I loved was the relationship between Bloom and his wife.  That scene where he is in the tub in his pajamas and his wife joins him just about brought me to tears.  You could still feel the love between the two characters.Go see this movie.

William is determined to find out the truth behind his father as everything that he has heard since childhood about his father has been fantastic imaginations about giants, miraculous adventures, and big mysterious fish.

The undoubted master of the ""adult fairytale"" tackles the issue of the relationship between Father and Son in the film 'Big Fish'. With an impressive cast including Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup and Jessica Lange - oh, and not forgetting ""Mrs Burton"" (Helena Bonham Carter) - 'Big Fish' is set up to succeed from the get-go. What Burton has created is a humorous and yet moving journey through the fantastic life of one Edward Bloom as retold through a series of flashbacks. The film strongly evokes memories of the equally surreal 'Edward Scissorhands' and the gently comedic fictional biopic 'Forrest Gump'.This film is a heart-warming, funny and quite mesmerising tale. There is something strangely homely about Burton's 'Big Fish' - it is one of those films that makes you reassess some of your own relationships. The acting is of a high calibre throughout - I thought Lange's performance as the loving wife of Bloom was wonderfully understated in particular. The supporting actors include the superb Steve Buscemi and Burton's old mate Danny De Vito. I did have a couple of minor gripes in this regard however - Finney's delivery is sometimes mumbled or slurred to an extent that I could not make out what he was saying (this could have been intentional, but was irritating nonetheless) and McGregor's Alabama accent was jarring. It's not that he didn't carry it off, but for an actor who has such a characteristic accent of his own (Sean Connery anyone?), the fake southern drawl did take a little while for me to feel comfortable with it.This story will make you laugh and will warm the cockles of all but the most hard-hearted viewer. Highly recommended as a film for those prepared to sit back, suspend disbelief, relax and enjoy the ride. If you have seen some of Burton's other work ('Sleepy Hollow', 'Beetlejuice' or 'Edward Scissorhands' for instance), you may be one of those people who feel they are just a little too weird...possibly a little too contrived. Have no fear if that is the case. Whilst this bears the undeniable Burton stamp, it is probably his most accessible - dare I say mainstream - film.

Ewan McGregor plays Young Edward Bloom and Albert Finney (in his Golden-Globe nominated performance) plays his older version of Edward years later. Billy Crudup plays Edward's son, Will. The story is about a father who is dying of cancer and the son who doesn't believe the facts of his life because they seemed too impossible to have really happened. Edward retells his facts of his life to his son and his daughter-in-law, Josephine, played by Marion Cotillard. Through his retellings, he meets a lot of strange, but interesting people. Karl the Giant, played by Matthew McGrory, Jenny, The Witch, played both by Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's real-life girlfriend. There is Norther Winslow, played by Steve Buscemi, Amos Calloway, played by Burton regular, Danny DeVito. Ping and Jing, played by Ada Tai and Arlene Tai. Edward meets the love of her life and his wife, played in his retellings by Alison Lohman and played outside of his retellings by Jessica Lange. There is also the family doctor, Dr. Bennett, played by Robert Guillaume. The movie is brilliant, Tim Burton's best movie ever and his directing is brilliant without compromise. The screenplay by John August, which is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace, the screenwriter of Go, Titan A.E., Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. His next screenplay is again with Tim Burton for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant and the end credits song ""Man Of The Hour"" by Pearl Jam is brilliant without compromise. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. The movie also got a Golden Globe Best Picture nomination for a Musical or Comedy. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is brilliant. The production and costume design by Dennis Gassner and Colleen Atwood is brilliant. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian is superb. The visual effects by Sony Pictures Imageworks is brilliant. The performances by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast are amazing, especially from McGregor, Finney, and Crudup. Casting them was a brilliant plan on Tim Burton's part. I loved this movie, because it was different than what Burton usually does. It is a brilliant achievement for Burton and it is a masterpiece. How it was made was intriguing because it seems that it was strange, but once I got used to the idea of the movie, it made me change my mind right away. It was a little bit like Burton's last masterpiece ""Ed Wood"". I enjoyed that movie but I enjoyed this movie better, because it proves that Burton is a gifted filmmaker who knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it. Go see this movie when you can get a chance because it is a brilliant movie that hit the top of my top 10 movies of 2003, and not because that, because of your opinion of the movie, which could change people's minds like it did with me.

804715,A1UYUPHN7NOU8F,B0001GOH6Q,La Belle (The Beauty),"[0, 0]","In 2005 or 2006, I borrowed this movie from my sister. The first 10 times I watched this, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was a really awesome movie and one of the best that I've ever seen. A few months ago, I watched it again and I didn't seem to have the same enjoyment for it. I noticed that the movie seemed to drag on a lot. The movie was over 2 hours long so where there were parts that dragged on, I found myself wanting it to be over quicker and it bored me just a little bit. If I wrote this review back then, I probably would've given the movie 5 stars, but seeing as how my enjoyment for it has lessened since then, I decided to just give it 4 stars.I think this movie deserves 4 stars because of the way it was filmed. Tim Burton was the director for this film and I really like how he did all of the sets and stuff. He's got some weird ideas that actually work in a lot of his movies. Ewan McGregor is a good actor, and this may not have been his best acting job, but what I really enjoyed about the character he played is that he (his character) had enduring love for his wife. In one scene, there was a woman that he befriended who was coming on to him, and he told the woman that the only woman he loved and wanted to be with was his wife and then he left. I also liked the fact that this movie portrays the main character (Edward Bloome, portrayed by Ewan McGregor) as having many adventures, meeting and befriending the strangest of people. He tells these fantastical stories about the people he meets and the adventures that he's had, and some of the stories had a little something extra added to them.*SPOILER ALERT*There's one story he tells where he meets these women who are Siamese twins and they are conjoined together at the waist, but the end of the movie revealed that, while they are twins, they are not conjoined. Those same twins, and all the people he met through the years, went to Edward's funeral. At his funeral, you can see that they aren't conjoined twins. That story is what I mean when I say that he told fantastical stories. His stories were true, but they were told with something a little more, just so he could make it interesting.*END OF SPOILER*The story revolves around a dying father (Edward Bloome) and his son, who is trying to learn more about his dad by piecing together the stories he has gathered over the years. The son winds up re-creating his father's elusive life in a series of legends and myths inspired by the few facts he knows. Through these tales, the son begins to understand his father's great feats and his great failings.Overall, I'd say that this movie would be a great purchase for someone who is interested in movies that contain fairytale stories. It's OK if you don't like fairytales or fantasies.

Tim Burton directed this film, but it is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace.  Those who are disappointed by this film probably feel so because the ending does not reach the lyrical height of &quot;Edward Scissorshand&quot; and the powerful idea of why it snows sometime in that suburban town.  I was actually thinking along those lines, wondering what wonder Burton would pull out of his hat this time, when it dawned on that this was not that sort of a movie.&quot;Big Fish&quot; twists time between the present, in which old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, and the mythical past, in which the young Ed Bloom (Ewen McGregor) has the adventures that he is always telling everybody about.  Ed has been telling stories all of his life, to the complete enjoyment and captivation of everybody who hears them, except for his son, Will (Billy Crudup).  After a flare up at his wedding, where he thinks the day should finally be about him rather than his father, Will goes off to Paris with his wife to work as a wire service reporter and stops talking with his father.  But then the old man's health takes a final turn for the worse, William comes home and finally demands that his father finally tell him something about his life that is real before he dies.  Ed is not worried because when he was young he looked into the glass eye of a witch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and he knows how he dies and this is not it...yet.What I picked up early in this movie is that Will is wrong.  Ed is not a blowhard.  Forget what Billy says and listen to him tell a story.  Look at the faces of his wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange), his daughter-in-law Josephine (Marion Cotillard), and the people in the audience when Ed tells his story.  Even when they let Ed know that they already know the story, such as the one about the car and the maple tree, these women have such love for Ed on their faces.  Only Will misses the point, and apparently he takes some of the audience members with him.  But when Burton gives cinematic vision to Ed's stories we can see the magic as well as hear it.So we get to see the stories about Ed meeting Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), his meeting Ping (Ada Tai) and Jin (Arlene Tai) during the war, and his wooing of the beautiful young Sandra (a postively glowing Alison Lohman).  Because this is Tim Burton these sequences are as fantastical as you would expect.  However, ironically, there is a moment in &quot;Big Fish&quot; where Burton goes too far and gives Will a brief glimpse of the fantasy world of which his father spins his tales.  However, that moment is a mistake, because it sets up the idea the film's final payoff might be along those lines and is at odds with both the conclusion and the overall film.The trap in this film is quite clear to me now.  Audience members think they are supposed to identify with Will rather than Old Ed.  The truth is that we are supposed to identify with young Ed.  How can we not?  It is young Ed who hits the long homerun, who wins the girl, and who saves the town of Spectre.  But do not feel sorry for old Ed, because his wife is perfectly willing to climb into the bathtub with him, even when they are both dressed.  Will is the one that his been missing the magic and who realizes an ephihany when he proves himself to be his father's son.",5,&quot;There are some fish that can't be caught&quot;,1076112000,"02 7, 2004",2004,3452,"['think', 'who', 'are', 'disappointed', 'quot', 'Big', 'Fish', 'quot', 'keep', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'directed', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Wallace', 'who', 'are', 'disappointed', 'film', 'probably', 'feel', 'so', 'ending', 'not', 'reach', 'lyrical', 'height', 'quot', 'Edward', 'Scissorshand', 'quot', 'powerful', 'idea', 'why', 'sometime', 'suburban', 'town', 'was', 'actually', 'thinking', 'lines', 'wondering', 'what', 'Burton', 'would', 'pull', 'hat', 'time', 'when', 'dawned', 'was', 'not', 'sort', 'movie.', 'quot', 'Big', 'Fish', 'quot', 'twists', 'time', 'present', 'old', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'dying', 'mythical', 'past', 'young', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Ewen', 'McGregor', 'adventures', 'always', 'telling', 'everybody', 'Ed', 'been', 'telling', 'stories', 'life', 'complete', 'enjoyment', 'captivation', 'everybody', 'who', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'flare', 'up', 'wedding', 'where', 'day', 'should', 'finally', 'be', 'rather', 'father', 'Will', 'Paris', 'wife', 'work', 'wire', 'service', 'reporter', 'talking', 'father', 'then', 'old', 'man', 'health', 'final', 'turn', 'worse', 'William', 'home', 'finally', 'father', 'finally', 'tell', 'something', 'life', 'real', 'Ed', 'not', 'worried', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'looked', 'glass', 'eye', 'witch', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'how', 'not', 'yet.What', 'picked', 'up', 'early', 'movie', 'Will', 'wrong', 'Ed', 'not', 'blowhard', 'Forget', 'what', 'Billy', 'listen', 'tell', 'story', 'Look', 'wife', 'Sandra', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'daughter-in-law', 'Josephine', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'people', 'audience', 'when', 'Ed', 'story', 'Even', 'when', 'let', 'Ed', 'know', 'already', 'know', 'story', 'such', 'one', 'car', 'maple', 'tree', 'women', 'have', 'such', 'love', 'Ed', 'Only', 'Will', 'point', 'apparently', 'audience', 'members', 'when', 'Burton', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'Ed', 'stories', 'can', 'see', 'magic', 'as', 'well', 'hear', 'it.So', 'get', 'see', 'stories', 'Ed', 'meeting', 'Karl', 'Giant', 'Matthew', 'McGrory', 'circus', 'run', 'Amos', 'Calloway', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'meeting', 'Ping', 'Ada', 'Tai', 'Jin', 'Arlene', 'Tai', 'war', 'wooing', 'beautiful', 'young', 'Sandra', 'postively', 'glowing', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'sequences', 'are', 'as', 'fantastical', 'would', 'expect', 'However', 'ironically', 'moment', 'quot', 'Big', 'Fish', 'quot', 'where', 'Burton', 'too', 'far', 'Will', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'fantasy', 'world', 'father', 'tales', 'However', 'moment', 'mistake', 'up', 'idea', 'film', 'final', 'payoff', 'might', 'be', 'lines', 'odds', 'conclusion', 'overall', 'film.The', 'trap', 'film', 'quite', 'clear', 'now', 'Audience', 'members', 'think', 'are', 'supposed', 'identify', 'Will', 'rather', 'Old', 'Ed', 'truth', 'are', 'supposed', 'identify', 'young', 'Ed', 'How', 'can', 'not', 'young', 'Ed', 'who', 'long', 'homerun', 'who', 'girl', 'who', 'town', 'Spectre', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'old', 'Ed', 'wife', 'perfectly', 'willing', 'climb', 'bathtub', 'even', 'when', 'are', 'dressed', 'Will', 'one', 'been', 'missing', 'magic', 'who', 'ephihany', 'when', 'be', 'father', 'son']",N/A
804717,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001GOH6Q,Lawyeraau,"[1, 2]","This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book &quot;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&quot; by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell,  at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).When his father becomes seriously ill, however,  Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others.  It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes,  where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker,  a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a  bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.  Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.  Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.  The direction, however,  is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.  This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.  I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best.

I can enjoy fantasy and symbolism in a movie, but the whimsical and circus-type elements in this particular film were a little too much for me. Although, by the end of the film it does all makes more sense.This is the kind of film that you could watch a second time and experience it again like new. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy it enough the first time to want to watch it a second time.I think the father's character should have been fleshed out a little more. It didn't like his character much as an old man. I did like him as a young man, but the episodic bits didn't give me enough to really sympathize with him. The son's character was well done, however.The acting, directing, and special effects are good. I imagine Tim Burton fans will enjoy this movie. The average person may not enjoy it as much.As far as moral content, it was refreshing to see a character choose to remain faithful to his wife. However, disappointingly, the &quot;family values&quot; merit of the film is undercut by its nude scenes (as well as some swearing).As far as the DVD elements, it's got the standard &quot;plot rehash, with comments by the actors&quot; stuff, as well as running commentary by the director, I believe.

804721,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,B0001GOH6Q,"Maine Writer ""David""","[7, 9]","There's a dreamlike quality to Big Fish, a kind of luminous, otherworldly tone that befits a story that skips from the incredible to the mundane like a flickering candle. In the end, it is a surreal, touching story--a darn good tear puller--that left me feeling a bit happier, and even a bit wiser.  Nicely done.I must admit that I'd held off seeing this movie because I'd lost hope for Tim Burton.  His downright awful remake of one of my favorite films, Planet of the Apes, had turned me cynical and suspicious.  Was he, as it appeared, just a poseur--with dirty mop of unkempt hair and fat-framed glasses fancied by eighty-year-olds?  Had his successes been a scam perpetrated by a guy who'd fooled a lot of dim-brained Hollywood numbskulls?  Big Fish, if it truly is Burton's child (after the Apes fiasco, I must admit that I've not entirely disabused myself of the idea that Burton just put his name on this--but I digress), redeems him.  It isn't soaringly great, but it is truly well-done and enjoyable.There are a few minor problems which I should point out.  Billy Crudup, who plays a son in search of his real father, is a very weak actor, and whether it's him or the role he plays, or both, he comes across as just plain unlikeable.  It's really too bad, since his role could have provided for an added bit of depth and resonance to the film.  Thankfully, his screen time is very limited--perhaps Burton, himself, judged that Crudup was too weak to merit a central place on the screen.  But for all of Crudup's weakness, Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor give outstanding performances.  McGregor, who plays Crudup's father character as young man, shines with likeability and energy, the kind of person you meet rarely in life and who pulls you in with his joy and indefagitable innocence.  Finney is splended as a sputtering, kind-hearted yarn-spinner.  Jessica Lange is fine in her small role, and the young actress who plays her character as a young woman (Alison Lohman) is almost too beautiful to be believed--which adds, of course, to the ghostly, dreamlike quality of the film.I really liked this film, clumsy fish metaphor aside!

Maybe it was the fact that I am now in a point of my life, with my father over 75 years old and my son who is not even one, but I could identify with the main character and his struggle to dig the truth buried inside his father's extraordinary stories he grew up listening to over and over. I felt compelled to follow the story through the world of fantasy that Burton assembled for us, to a point where everything started making perfect sense. He has done it before and he did it again, and for that I thank him.Should you watch this movie? Absolutely.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","Interesting casting choices in having Scottish Ewan McGregor play the young version and Brit Albert Finney play the older version of Alabama Tall Tale Teller Edward Bloom.  There is a payoff, though, because Edward Bloom is a man larger than life and both of these actors successfully bring this character to the screen in larger-than-life fashion.Edward Bloom loves to tell stories and his favorite ones have Edward Bloom as the main character.  His stories are entertaining to folks the first time they hear them.  His grown son loved the stories when he was young too, but now they are both older, the stories are no longer charming, and the son feels that he doesn't know his &quot;real&quot; father at all.This scintillating film by Tim Burton lets us see the legendary side of Edward Bloom, and in bits and pieces it lets us in on where the fiction ends and the facts really lie.  The elderly Edward Bloom isn't against telling the truth, but he recognizes that there is more fun if there is &quot;flavor&quot; in the stories as well.Danny Elfman's score, as usual, provides the perfect compliment to a Burton film.  Supporting roles are wonderfully cast, such as Jessica Lange as the grown-up Mrs. Bloom and Alison Lohman as the younger version of the same character. Danny Devito plays a circus ring-leader with a secret or two. Steve Buscemi plays a beloved poet laureate who goes looking for adventure because of the example of our Hero. Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful in essentially three roles, as an old witch with a glass-eye which tells you how you're going to die if you look into it, then as the young and older versions of a woman who takes a fancy to Edward Bloom in the mythic town of Spectre Alabama.  Ten foot giants, giant catfish, Siamese-twin vaudeville singers are only a small part of the narrative which weaves back and forth between a wonderfully inventive fantasy world and the reality of the world of Edward Bloom.Only recommended for those with imagination who want to be entertained.",5,Tim Burton knows how to tell a Tall Tale!,1088380800,"06 28, 2004",2004,2019,"['Interesting', 'casting', 'choices', 'having', 'Scottish', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'play', 'young', 'version', 'Brit', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'play', 'older', 'version', 'Alabama', 'Tall', 'Tale', 'Teller', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'payoff', 'though', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'man', 'larger', 'life', 'actors', 'successfully', 'bring', 'character', 'screen', 'larger-than-life', 'fashion.Edward', 'Bloom', 'tell', 'stories', 'favorite', 'ones', 'have', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'main', 'character', 'stories', 'are', 'entertaining', 'folks', 'first', 'time', 'hear', 'grown', 'son', 'loved', 'stories', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'too', 'now', 'are', 'older', 'stories', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'charming', 'son', ""n't"", 'know', 'quot', 'real', 'quot', 'all.This', 'scintillating', 'film', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'see', 'legendary', 'side', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'bits', 'pieces', 'where', 'fiction', 'facts', 'really', 'lie', 'elderly', 'Edward', 'Bloom', ""n't"", 'telling', 'truth', 'more', 'fun', 'quot', 'flavor', 'quot', 'stories', 'well.Danny', 'Elfman', 'score', 'usual', 'perfect', 'compliment', 'Burton', 'film', 'Supporting', 'roles', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'cast', 'such', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'grown-up', 'Mrs.', 'Bloom', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'younger', 'version', 'same', 'character', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'circus', 'ring-leader', 'secret', 'two', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'beloved', 'poet', 'laureate', 'who', 'looking', 'adventure', 'example', 'Hero', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'wonderful', 'essentially', 'three', 'roles', 'old', 'witch', 'glass-eye', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', 'look', 'then', 'young', 'older', 'versions', 'woman', 'who', 'fancy', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'mythic', 'town', 'Spectre', 'Alabama', 'Ten', 'foot', 'giants', 'giant', 'catfish', 'Siamese-twin', 'vaudeville', 'singers', 'are', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'narrative', 'back', 'forth', 'wonderfully', 'inventive', 'fantasy', 'world', 'reality', 'world', 'Edward', 'Bloom.Only', 'recommended', 'imagination', 'who', 'want', 'be', 'entertained']",N/A

I think it's a story that is either too small or too big but somehow it just doesn't fit. And Billy Crudup is just plain boring in everything.I almost snuck into the theater to see this because I was seeing LOTR ROTK for the 2nd time and it was almost over while Big Fish was just beginning. My morality won out and I waited for the dvd. The first time I watched it I was just plain bored. I don't know why but I was expecting something bigger, something more magical and exciting. It came across as one of those Babe the Blue Ox stories I remember as a kid. The giant wasn't giant, the witch wasn't scary, and the fish wasn't very big.Since then I've seen it on cable and my 10yr old son sat down to watch it with me. Any time he shows interest I pay attention just because he never watches anything I have on.(Unlike my 7yr old daughter who watched Lost in Translation last week). Well he seemed to get it, and since he did I paid more attention and I got a lot more of it too.I love Ewan McGregor, I really do, but I wonder if he was what I didn't like about the movie. It was so contrived to begin with that having him stretch his accent, even though he did it well, along with the wacky plotlines may have been too much.Albert Finney was superb. I would have believed anything he said, and Jessica Lange was teriffic in a very subtle performance. All of the actors were great except Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor who just didn't fit for some reason. Maybe Ewan played it too over the top and Billy was too reserved I don't know.I can't help but think there was at least 20 minutes left on the cutting room floor that may have made this a much better film.All in all it is watchable and the performances of the supporting cast are very enjoyable despite a shaky plotline and some iffy acting from the leads.

804732,A16X7GKCK83WUE,B0001GOH6Q,"Matthew Bratkowski ""mattster""","[1, 2]","The movie Big Fish is an elaborate tall tale woven into a clasic father and son story.  Edward Bloom (Albert Finnely) is dying and his son William (Billy Crudup) wants to make peace with his father before he passes away.  What results is the story of an average man's life portrayed through a series of mythical tales.  Bloom's stories, which were often a bother for his son, depict a man whose life is often exaggerated, yet full of adventure and zest.  At the movie's end, William finally realizes the importance of his father's stories and cherishes them instead of condeming them as being foolish.This movie is common of movies directed by Tim Burton in terms of its somewhat numerous and sometimes unusual visual effects, but has more heart than any other of his movies that I have seen and only has very small hints of horror (moving trees, a werewolf, etc) that are meant more to amuse than to frighten.  I would liken the effects to be of the same caliber to those in Burton's Beetlejuice, but far less scarier.  The special effects in this movie are great and make it a very lively and enjoyable story.  The acting in Big Fish is also pretty good.  Ewan McGregor does a superior job playing the young Edward Bloom and Finnely and Crudup make a good father and son pair.I would recommend this movie if you are interested in a touching story about father and son relationships, life and death, family, the South, and above of course tall tales.  It is a good movie to watch with your family but even if you watch it alone, I'll bet that the end of the movie will still tug at your heartstrings.

Young Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and old Bloom by Albert Finney. He is on his deathbed and his son Edward who is played by Billy Crudup has come to make his reconciliation with his dad. He's tired of his dad's stories and wants the truth from him. He feels like he doesn't know his dad, and he knows time is runnig out.Ewan McGreggor is awesome. His fans will argue this as his best performance ever and I think it is. He is enchanting in the movie. He does a great job faking the accent and he just takes the role and runs with it. I wish he could get really get academy consideration for his role. It's really that great and an Oscar nomination should go his way. He's just as good as Depp in Pirates and Penn in Mystic River. This could be the best performance of his young carear. Ewan won't disappoint you.I liked Billy Crudup in the movie. His character isn't a real lively one and has a lot of mixed emotions about his father. Crudup plays with the emotions well. He's a good actor and I hope to see more of his work in the future.You also have to love Albert Finney in the movie. His character is loveable and he displays a spark that just makes you smile. He's a loveable old guy and his performacne will and can draw tears.Tim Burton has just made a simply fantastic film. I really wish I could just shake his hand.

804734,A152C8GYY25HAH,B0001GOH6Q,Matthew Horner,"[2, 3]","Famed cult director Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" was greeted by generally positive reviews, but some of the negative ones were scathing - dull and preachy, belabored, pretentious, long-winded, strained. So, as a Burton fan, it was with some trepidation that I saw the movie. I'm glad I did. It's got its weaknesses - some of the fantasies don't work as well as Burton had hoped they would, I suspect. But, for the most part, it does work as a delicate, almost magical allegory. It also contains some great performances, especially by Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Helena Bonham Carter.What if, when you were a kid, your father filled your head with fantastic stories of his own youth? Stories about his encounters with a very big fish, amazing exploits in a war, encounters with a giant, his travels to a town that exists in its own space and time, etc.? And you, as a young man, with your limited imagination, could not accept your father's filling you with these stories? What if you could not relate to him because you felt his whole life was a lie? And, finally, what if you discovered that his crazy stories were not, after all, that far from what really happened? What would you do?These and other questions are what confront Will Bloom [Billy Crudup] when he returns home from New York City to the rural South where his father, Ed [Finney] lays dying. Hostile and angry, Will confronts his father. [Of great importance to the story is Will's mother [Lange], who loves Ed unconditionally and is enchanted by his wild tales. But, of course, she loves Will unconditionally as well.]As Will fights Ed, we see flashbacks of the young Ed [Ewan McGregor] living out these improbable tales in sequences of amazing visual detail.

Alcat ""Curiosity killed the cat, but sa...","[2, 4]","The relationship between a young man and his dying father takes center stage at this original movie, that seamlessly mixtures fantasy and reality in order to create a film well-worth watching.The son, William (Billy Crudup), wants to know more about his dad before it is too late, but is fed up with the incredible stories he always tell about himself. The problem is that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), cannot help but talk a lot and make reality more interesting, disguising it as he deems necessary. But after telling a story many times, it becomes real to you, and Ed can't distinguish truth from lies any more. But who knows, maybe he doesn't want to...The talks and fights between father and son, mixed with their interaction with their wives, take them down memory lane, as Ed remembers once again what happened to him from the moment he left his little town as a young man. Ed doesn't stop telling tall tales, but the spectator will be happy for that due to the fact that thanks to the skill of the director of ""Big Fish"" (Tim Burton) Ed's stories come alive, and we are introduced to witches, giants, werewolves, the biggest fish in the river and even to the charmed town that young Ed (Ewan Mc Gregor) visited in his wandering days. We also get to know how Ed met the girl he knew would become his wife (Alison Lohman, afterwards played by Jessica Lange), and the unconventional way in which he proposed to her.Those stories are too strange to be truthful, of course, and that is the problem for Will. But soon enough he will realise that maybe not all Ed's stories are complete lies, and that he might know his father much more than he was aware of.I highly enjoyed this movie, even though it made me cry a little at the end. I want to point out that the general tone is one of optimism, and that ""Big Fish"" is so visually engaging that you will believe you are living an extraordinary fairy tale. And what can I say?.

804738,AESY8NCX6VS6O,B0001GOH6Q,M. Burns,"[3, 4]","There are a lot of high expectations out there for Tim Burton's newest film, namely because it's getting more Oscar talk than just about any of his movies combined. It's been called his ""masterpiece"" by some people, but more often than not, it's getting slammed for being uneven. Well, the film is uneven in parts; I'll give you that. As Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a slowly dying father and husband, ventures back into his past to tell of the outrageous situations into which he got, sometimes that quirkyness seems to hurt things. A few subplots simply border on being ridiculous, and it becomes easy to understand why Finney's thirty-something son resents him so much for feeding him what he considers a line of crap. But then, reader, there are moments in Big Fish (and many of them, at that) when the sun shines through the clouds and you're caught up in the rapturous experience of watching a good narrative. The movie starts off wonderfully, and reaches its pinnacle when the love of Edward's (played in his early years by Ewan McGregor) life enters the picture in a gorgeous moment during a circus. Fish also has some really intelligent things to say about the nature of truth, the bond between fathers and sons, and the legacy of our lives.The effect of Big Fish upon viewers will be mainly a choice. You won't enjoy the movie if you sit back and agonize over how some of the philosophical notions of Burton's work have been explored much better in other movies; you'll probably roll your eyes at a key scene toward the end that looks like it was lifted out of 8 1/2; and you'll probably know where the whole darn thing is going at points. But you have another option - to sit back and let Burton's own catharsis of the death of his father wash over you in all its flawed, magical glory, and you won't leave dry-eyed. Sure, Big Fish isn't perfect, it is manipulative, and it won't get any Oscars, but it still beats a great deal of 'family' fare out there right now. Look carefully, too, and you'll see Ewan McGregor become a full-blown star. If anything, Big Fish is proof that we'll be seeing more from him in decades to come. Hopefully the same can be said about Fish's eccentric director.

804748,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0001GOH6Q,Michael Butts,"[2, 5]","BIG FISH is Tim Burton's most &quot;standard&quot; film to date, and yet it too has many strange eccentricities throughout.  In spite of its wonderful cast and some imaginative vignettes, the movie as a whole is less than satisfying.  Ultimately, I found myself saying &quot;Who cares?&quot;.  Edward Bloom is a larger than life character, indeed, but he avoids reality by creating absurd stories to go along with the events he has experienced.  Thus, the viewer is asked to sympathize and understand a man whose forays into the fantasy world provide him from facing the realities of his family's life.  His son has grown up feeling he has never even known his father, and the movie says that's okay, because the fantasy father was the real father.One can't fault the acting, though.  Helena Bonham Carter is a revelation as the crockety old witch and the young Jenny that falls in love with Bloom.  Alison Lohman looks so much like Jessica Lange, it's perfect casting, and she manages to possess that same dreamy quality Lange offers later.  Billy Crudup does a beautiful job with a thankless character whose destiny of course is to become just like his father.  Matthew McGory as Karl the giant is splendid in a role that could have been pure hokum; his Karl is more human than Edward would ever be.  Jessica Lange has a beautiful scene with Albert Finney in the bathtub, and does well with a poorly developed character.  Finney is brilliant, and deserved a supporting actor nomination.  Unfortunately, Ewan McGregor plays his character on an entirely one-note, bigger than life bravado that undermines the film's strengths.Burton is to be commended for attempting such an original film; I just didn't find it all that interesting.",3,A LITTLE POND,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,1733,"['BIG', 'FISH', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'most', 'quot', 'quot', 'film', 'date', 'yet', 'too', 'many', 'strange', 'eccentricities', 'spite', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'imaginative', 'vignettes', 'movie', 'whole', 'less', 'satisfying', 'Ultimately', 'found', 'saying', 'quot', 'Who', 'quot', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'indeed', 'reality', 'creating', 'absurd', 'stories', 'go', 'along', 'events', 'experienced', 'Thus', 'viewer', 'asked', 'sympathize', 'understand', 'man', 'forays', 'fantasy', 'world', 'provide', 'facing', 'realities', 'family', 'life', 'son', 'grown', 'up', 'feeling', 'never', 'even', 'known', 'father', 'movie', 'okay', 'fantasy', 'father', 'was', 'real', 'father.One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'acting', 'though', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'revelation', 'crockety', 'old', 'witch', 'young', 'Jenny', 'love', 'Bloom', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'so', 'much', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'perfect', 'casting', 'possess', 'same', 'dreamy', 'quality', 'Lange', 'later', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'beautiful', 'job', 'thankless', 'character', 'destiny', 'course', 'become', 'just', 'father', 'Matthew', 'McGory', 'Karl', 'giant', 'splendid', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pure', 'hokum', 'Karl', 'more', 'human', 'Edward', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'bathtub', 'well', 'poorly', 'developed', 'character', 'Finney', 'brilliant', 'deserved', 'supporting', 'actor', 'nomination', 'Unfortunately', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'character', 'entirely', 'one-note', 'bigger', 'life', 'bravado', 'film', 'strengths.Burton', 'be', 'commended', 'attempting', 'such', 'original', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting']",N/A

Filmmaking at its finest; where the intersection of great direction, acting, writing and wonderful story telling through powerful images all meet.  I can't think of anyone but Tim Burton could have made such a wonderful film.  I have never laughed and cried so hard in the same movie before in all my life. I do like Burton's other work, but often find hat it needs to grow on me over time for me to appreciate it.  ""Beattlejuice"" is a prime example of this.  However I fell in love with ""Batman"" and ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"" at first sight.Son ""William"" (Billy Crudup) is distant to his father, ""Edward Bloom"" (Albert Finney) a man he claims now he never knew. William struggles to figure out Edward whom is now dying of cancer.  Who is (was) he really?  William figures that all the great stories that his father has told him as he was growing up, are nothing more than lies and fabrications and slowly he makes the journey and researches these ""tall tales""; finding the truth among the fiction.  (The similarity in terms of  appearance between the ""young"" Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor) and the ""old"" Edward (Albert Finney) is astounding!  Kudos to both for their brilliant acting. Finally finding the love in his father's stories among the harsh reality of the world.  For Edward Bloom is (was) the big fish swimming in the even bigger ocean of the world.There are some amazing romantic moments in the film for all of us hopeless romantics.  The love between Edward and his wife (played by Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman) seem so honest, real and true.  The ""drying out"" bath tub sequence, the field of daffodils and finally the Big Fish being released in the river of life, sealed with a kiss brought many of tear to my eye.  As son tells a final story for his father, a gift is passed from one generation to the other.I want so bad for this movie to walk away with Oscar gold for there hasn't been a movie which has touched me so touched and moved me so deeply in years. (""American Beauty"" being the last.)  Still I'm afraid the epic ""Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King"" will walk way with all this years Oscar gold and justifiably so there hasn't been epic storytelling this good since the ""Star Wars"" Trilogy.  Still why I realize that ""The Return of the King"" (and the other two ""Lord of the Rings"" films) are great I can't really say I was moved by them in.  Touched yes, moved no.

It's not that they're bigger or faster then the other fish, they're just touched by something extra.""Does Columbia enjoy sitting on their butts while the other studios gather Oscar praise? They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Fish' is Wonderful Catch,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,5497,"['are', 'fish', 'ca',

804752,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001GOH6Q,mirasreviews,"[0, 2]","&quot;Big Fish&quot; has been adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and directed by Tim Burton. This whimsical tale of a strained parent-child relationship is Burton's most personal film to date. It's a story of a son returning to his childhood home, where his father is fatally ill, in hopes of discovering the man behind the myth that his father has always cultivated. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is in many ways a family drama with typical family themes, yet its otherworldly elements lend the film a distinct Burtonesque tone and appearance.Edward Bloom has been a personable man and a great storyteller all his life. His fantastic tales have been loved by all, no matter how much truth or myth they may contain. But ever since his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), was old enough to realize the stories couldn't be entirely true, he has resented his father's unwillingness to say things the way they are. Estranged as adults, Will visits his dying father (Albert Finney) in hopes of learning the truth behind the magnificent tales of Edward's youth and gaining an understanding of the man he has known only through elaborate myths.Although &quot;Big Fish&quot; is telling us the story of Edward and Will's relationship, Edward, true to form, tells us his life's story in fantastic tales. So the film spends most of its time recounting Edward Bloom's life story as he tells it, with young Edward played with great charm by Ewan McGregor. These adventures are a visual feast and don't seem to compete with the film's present-tense father-son drama. The myth and the drama are blended seamlessly, much to Tim Burton's and screenwriter John August's credit. The faults I find with &quot;Big Fish&quot; are that some of its stories would have been more interesting told rather than seen, and the odd conglomeration of stories that constitute Edward's repertoire sometimes give the film  an uneven pace. It goes without saying that &quot;Big Fish&quot; is sentimental. It most closely resembles Burton's &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; in tone.The DVD: Bonus features include two multi-part featurettes, which can also be viewed during the film by activating a feature called &quot;Fish Tales&quot;, a trivia quiz, and an audio commentary by director Tim Burton. When activated, &quot;Fish Tales&quot; displays an icon on your screen during the film's playback that will take you to the relevant featurette. The first featurette, &quot;The Character's Journey&quot; contains three parts, each focusing primarily on one of the film's characters: the young Edward Bloom, circus ringmaster Amos Callaway, and Will Bloom. The film's cast and director Tim Burton discuss the characters in interviews. The second featurette is &quot;The Filmmaker's Path&quot;, which has four parts. Tim Burton talks about the film's themes and inspirations. The production designer and effects coordinators discuss their role in expressing those themes. The fourth part, which is entitled &quot;The Author's Journey&quot; and features interviews with author Daniel Wallace and screenwriter John August, may be of interest to those who have read the book. &quot;The Fine Points: A Trivia Quiz&quot; is a game which allows you to view a short documentary about filming the circus scene if you answer the trivia questions. Tim Burton's audio commentary has an unusual format. It's an interview, so there is someone asking Burton specific questions as the subjects come up during the movie. This makes the commentary kind of low-key, but very informative. Burton talks about every aspect of the film, from its themes in relation to his own life to comments about the performances to technical details of filming. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.

Considering the films' sweetness, warm nature and uplifting story, is surprised to learn that Tim Burton was on hand to direct.  Burton, now in his fourties, is a perpetual Hollywood outsider, often telling stories of sympathetic oddballs and socital outcasts, which come through in films like his ""Edward Scissorhands"" and even his take on Batman, which paint Bruce Wayne has a lonely, bachelor billionaire saving society while not taking full part in it either.  But in ""Big Fish,"" Burton shows his emotional range, reportedly taking the project after the death of his own father.The film opens as Edward Bloom (a terrific Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) are estranged due to Edwards' unbelievable stories about his life, which Will has grown tired of.  But, with Edward on his death bed, Will goes to his side, to try and learn the truth to why his father tells these tales.  Through various stroytellers and listeners, we learn Edwards' remarkable life story:  meeting witches, giants, werewolves, swampy utopias, his romantic hook up with his wife (Allison Loman and Jessica Lange), his fighting in Korea and saving that same Utopia he had visited earlier in his life.  This web of stories are expertly woven by, not only Burton, but also screenwriter John August (""Go"") who fill the story, not only with idyllic images of Americana and plenty of good-natured humor, but with an emotional core that one cannot help but connect with.And that core is done justice by an excellent acting ensemble, led by the lovable Albert Finney as the aging Bloom an Ewan McGregor and the younger.  Their performances perfectly match, weaving a character as fanciful as his stories but also as real as his disease.  Look for Finney to take home an Oscar for his work.  Billy Crudup is wonderful as well as the doubting Will, who softens throughout the film, leading to a tear-jerker scene in which, by telling his own story, Will shows he understands his father.  Juicy turns are on hand all around, as Steve Buscemi plays a poet turned bank robber, Danny De-Vito as a werewolf carnival manager and Helena Bonham Carter as a scret admirer of Edward and his tales.  One of the surprise best of the year, ""Big Fish"" will leave you believing in those tall tales again, and Tim Burton's filmmaking abilities.",5,"""It's Impossible to Separate the Fact from the Fiction""",1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,2589,"['Keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'Big', 'Fish', 'fact', 'fiction', 'come', 'together', 'cohesive', 'whole', 'paint', 'picture', 'eccentric', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'touching', 'fanciful', 'story', 'father', 'who', 'tall', 'tales', 'son', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'Considering', 'films', 'sweetness', 'warm', 'nature', 'uplifting', 'story', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'hand', 'direct', 'Burton', 'now', 'fourties', 'perpetual', 'Hollywood', 'outsider', 'often', 'telling', 'stories', 'sympathetic', 'oddballs', 'socital', 'outcasts', 'come', 'films', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'even', 'take', 'Batman', 'paint', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'lonely', 'bachelor', 'billionaire', 'saving', 'society', 'not', 'taking', 'full', 'part', 'Big', 'Fish', 'Burton', 'emotional', 'range', 'reportedly', 'taking', 'project', 'death', 'own', 'father.The', 'film', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'terrific', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'are', 'estranged', 'due', 'Edwards', 'unbelievable', 'stories', 'life', 'Will', 'grown', 'tired', 'Edward', 'death', 'bed', 'Will', 'side', 'try', 'learn', 'truth', 'why', 'father', 'tales', 'various', 'stroytellers', 'listeners', 'learn', 'Edwards', 'remarkable', 'life', 'story', 'meeting', 'witches', 'giants', 'werewolves', 'swampy', 'utopias', 'romantic', 'hook', 'up', 'wife', 'Allison', 'Loman', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'fighting', 'Korea', 'saving', 'same', 'Utopia', 'had', 'visited', 'earlier', 'life', 'web', 'stories', 'are', 'expertly', 'woven', 'not', 'only', 'Burton', 'also', 'screenwriter', 'John', 'August', 'Go', 'who', 'fill', 'story', 'not', 'only', 'idyllic', 'images', 'Americana', 'plenty', 'good-natured', 'humor', 'emotional', 'core', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'connect', 'with.And', 'core', 'done', 'justice', 'excellent', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'led', 'lovable', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'aging', 'Bloom', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'younger', 'performances', 'perfectly', 'match', 'weaving', 'character', 'as', 'fanciful', 'stories', 'also', 'as', 'real', 'disease', 'Look', 'Finney', 'take', 'home', 'Oscar', 'work', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'wonderful', 'as', 'well', 'doubting', 'Will', 'who', 'film', 'leading', 'tear-jerker', 'scene', 'telling', 'own', 'story', 'Will', 'father', 'Juicy', 'turns', 'are', 'hand', 'around', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'poet', 'turned', 'bank', 'robber', 'Danny', 'De-Vito', 'werewolf', 'carnival', 'manager', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'scret', 'admirer', 'Edward', 'tales', 'One', 'surprise', 'best', 'year', 'Big', 'Fish', 'will', 'leave', 'believing', 'tall', 'tales', 'again', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'filmmaking', 'abilities']",N/A

First of all, the visuals are some of Tim Burton's best to date. The multiple fantasy worlds he has created are some of the most unique ever put to film. The acting is extremely strong, especially Albert Finney(old Edward), Ewan McGregor(young Edward), Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi(very funny role), and even the little known Billy Crudup as Edward's truth seeking son. All the rest of the cast are great as well, but have much smaller roles. Even though this film is full of funny and amusing situations, it is still at heart a serious and moving film. My eyes actually teared up at the end sequence with Albert Finney's character being taken into the river with all his friends watching on. This film will be watched by many for years to come, and some have already called it Burton's masterpiece. While the visuals alone are not impressive enough to top Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, or even the first two Batman films, it is the Father-Son story that breathes life and warmth into an already beautiful looking film. As the wisest people claim that true beauty is on the inside rather than the outside, is only but a half truth as with some of Edward's stories in this film.

And now that I've got that out of my system I'll move on to the review.Edward Bloom has always been destined for bigger things.  And his stories are the stuff of legend.  He packed a lot of living into his years.  It's a shame his son doesn't believe a word of it.  And a certain wedding speech alienates them for three years until Edward is diagnosed with cancer.  While visiting his dad, flashbacks to Edward's incredible life come through and we see how he left his home town, his time with the circus, his time with the army, and most important, how he met his wife and love of his life.  And he needs an end to his story, one that he heard a long time ago but is the only tale he hasn't told.Characters:Albert Finney: Old Edward BloomEwan McGregor: Young Edward BloomChristopher Mcpherson Jr.: Child Edward BloomJessica Lange: Sandra K. BloomAlison Lohman: Young Sandra K. BloomBilly Crudup: William BloomMarion Cotillard Josephine BloomHelena Bonham Carter: Witch/JennyHailey Anne Nelson: Young JennyRobert Guillaume: Dr. BennettMatthew McGrory: KarlDanny DeVito: Amos CallowaySteve Buscemi: Norther WinslowEwan McGregor has the largest part in this movie and he does very well.  He's completely cocky and fitting to the personality of Edward.  But he's still likable.  And he's a good storyteller.  Older Edward is not quite as charming, but then again he's on his sick bed so that's understandable.  I think the hidden talent in the movie though is Jessica Lange.  She plays a quiet part, but acts completely devoted to Edward and makes the relationship beautiful.  I especially loved the tub scene between the two (and no it's not as dirty as it sounds).  The other characters are in and out of the movie at irregular intervals, but they are all unique and special.  I think they chose well for the parts as everyone is funny without being over the top.Since this movie is based on tall tales, everything in it was a little over the line of being outrageous.  But it was interesting and I can't say that I've ever seen something like it before.  The movie weaved its way through Edward's life in somewhat chronological order (except when it's showing him as older and dying).  Even the little touches were well done, like the life with the circus and various jobs that Edward had to perform.  It's not often you have a movie that can combine War, daffodils, elephant poop, and witches.  Although I should warn, there's back end nudity of both men and women in this movie.  Not that that's a big deal, but still thought I'd have the warning here.  My only real complaint with the movie is that it had some pacing issues in some parts.The cinematography is outstanding.  Unlike most of Burton's movies where everything is dark, this one has a lot of light.  Lit-up towns, a bright circus, performance during war, everything has a lot of color.  It's a pleasure to watch because of it.  And even the special effects, although somewhat cheesy, are well done.  I especially enjoyed the catfish that was featured throughout the movie.  The music is so-so.  It fit with all the scenes but I can't say that it was memorable.Big Fish is a good movie.  It has a lot of emotion and while it's not perfect, it is perfectly enjoyable.Review by M.

I am a self-proclaimed Tim Burton fanatic but this one is really up there for me.Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job as the main character but the crux of this film is the relationship between he and his son.  Through his father's stories, one thread remained true, family was always family.  As the witch in the town Edward Bloom tried to save said, ""It was always your mother"".  Every woman always came back to Jessica Lange's character for Edward Bloom.Like most of us, Ewan McGregor was a mix of fact and fiction.  His life was made better because he made it that way.  His son found this at his death, before most of us really meet our father.  Most of us really get to know our dad's after they are gone when it is too late.  OK, I'm siging ""Mike and the Mechanics"", ""In the Living Years"" right now.  We usually cannot accept them as they are when they are here.Jessica Lange was an awesome addition to the cast as Ewan McGregor's wife.  As we find in the end of the film, many of the ""characters"" from the ""tall tales"" were real people that knew and loved Billy Crudup's father.A life well lived can be quiet and uneventful but a life well lived can also be told in technicolor.  We are called to dream the dreams and make our imaginations color our worlds.  How many really do that in their mundane lives?This film reminded me of James Blunt's CD ""Back to Bedlam"".  It makes you believe in true love standing the test of time again.  It is not syrupy and it is not fake.

Exaggerated, unreal and totally engrossing we all created fantastic, dream-like stories of who we'd like to be and how the world could be that dominated our lives. Fortunately or unfortunately, most of us have forgotten how to do it, unlike Ed Bloom, a man who is incapable of believing and therefore retelling a story without exaggerating it into a childishly idealistic view of how things were.And that's what ""Big Fish"" is all about - the retelling of Ed's highly entertaining, charming, enthusiastic, at times very funny and, of course, ridiculously unbelievable tales which provide a bizarrely surrealistic canvas that's perfectly suited to Tim Burton's skills in creating ""fantastic"" cinematic visualisations.Or is it? His stories enrich his own life but their telling is a completely self-centred and even self-destructive exercise. On the one hand, they reveal a wonderfully romantic man who only sees the beautiful and exciting things in life and whose memories amplify the ""good things"" out of all proportion to reality; on the other, a man who is so wrapped-up in his fantasies that he completely alienates his son who, having once been captivated by his tales, now sees them as repetitively boring and corrosive to his father's relationships. And here's where the real interest of the film lies. Tenderly and carefully explored, their wholly different views of the world and the tensions this causes elevate it from a superb slice of pure entertainment to a thought-provoking and deeply reflective insight into life, culminating in an intensely moving ""twist"" in which the son weaves an equally idealistic dream-story of the perfect death for his father, as he's dying, and, in doing so, realises that exaggerating the ""truth"" can be a powerful source of joy.Beautifully constructed and superbly acted the question ""Big Fish"" poses is, ""is it wrong for an adult to exaggerate things in such a childish way?""

As much as I loved Return of the King's apocryphal Lord of the Rings, Big Fish was the best picture last year (incidentally, Finding Nemo receives my vote for runner up).So why the dirth of recognition elsewhere?Our culture has stuck its head in the sand when it comes to accepting the wonderful. By wonderful I do not mean &quot;great.&quot; I mean those things that are full of wonder. Be they things that put us in awe, or things that merely make us smile, we have all forsaken, at least to a degree, the wide-open life before us.

This movie turned it the other way around, of the son refusing to take his father as he was &amp; subconsciously disowned him as none of them shared the same identity.  In the end, as the father was facing his inevitable death from terminal illness, the son finally came to term and reconciled with the demon that haunted him for years.  As viewers sat through the movie, in the end, we would understand the significance of the title, &quot;The Big Fish&quot;.  The bottom line is things are as they are.  As simple as that.  I could emphatise with this movie as I am having the same kind of relationship with my dad.  It's difficult to come to term with the fact that we are so different from one another but in the end, we simply have to learn to let go, clinging for the impossibility that perhaps, my dad happens to pretend to be someone that he's not.  I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's movies as his vision is second to none and distinctly his.  Other than his disappointment in Planet of the Apes, Tim Burton is arguably one of the most creative Director I truly appreciate.  By looking at the additional features in DVD, I could sense that this project is a very personal one for him.  One could also say that this movie is not as dark &amp; as bleak as his previous offerings and perhaps, it has something to do with his new life with Helen Bonham Carter who played different characters in this movie.  One could also catch a glimpse of the writer of &quot;The Big Fish&quot; as an Economics lecturer as a cameo appearance!  Overall, a very heart moving movie with strong performances by Albert Finney, Danny de Vito, Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor.

Besides the obvious father-son bond, Big Fish is a tribute to the art of storytelling and oral tradition, and how, no matter what, there is a grain of truth to all these tall tales.Big Fish was released around Oscar Season and an initial look at it would lead one to think that it would be a saccharine coated cry fest.  However, Burton was totally the right choice for this film as he doesn't lay the emotional side of the story on too thick, but does create something that might still tug at your heart strings.  Burton allows us to experience the emotion of the characters, but really spends time on the Bloom spun stories. They make the movie fun.  When Burton takes us back to the present, real world, robbed of the fanciful elements, we've been on a fun ride and are ready to get to the emotional payoff.The production on this film is fabulous.  From the colorful shots, fantastic scenery and costumes, the ubiquitous Danny Elfman score (arguably one of his best), this is a near perfect movie and is easily one of my favorite Tim Burton films.

Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought-provoking one that, chances are, will leave an indelible impression.This time around Tim Burton abandons his usually dark fare for the southern tall tale.  He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenom with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form.  As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age-old southern tradition that shows us the consequences of not being able to see the forest for the trees.In a nutshell, the story follows a son's last attempts to discover who his father really is as the son insists that during his upbringing, his father has hidden his true self behind his tall tales.  The son and the father have their final confrontation on the father's deathbed and it is here the son finally realizes the time he has wasted because of his ""inability to see for looking.""Albert Finney is simply captivating.  I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast.  While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents.  Ewan McGregor personfies charm as the young Edward Bloom.This is a wonderful dissertaion on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father-son relationship.  It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.Visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was.  While the end of the movie was somehwat melancholy, it was right on target and did not descend into maudlin sentimentality - it proved to be the natural order of events.I highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again.

804777,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0001GOH6Q,RMurray847,"[3, 7]","What is it with so many Tim Burton movies?  Visually they are an absolute treat...full of invention and a sense of almost childlike wonder.  But when it comes to revealing the workings of the human heart or clarifying plot developments, he so often falls short.BIG FISH presents us with the best of his good traits, and frankly, the worst of his lesser habits.Visually the movie is stunning.  We've all seen the trailers where Ewan McGregor has time stop for him when he meets the love of his life, and he brushes bits of flying popcorn out of the air as he approaches her.  Very cool.  Sets and costumes are whimsical, in the best sense.  His performers all work hard to get into that same spirit of wacky, not-quite-reality that the film strives to evoke.  I say try.  Often, they fail.BIG FISH is the story of a 30 something son come home to be with his dying father.  They have a strained relationship, because the boy feels he knows nothing about dad.  Dad always just told fanciful stories about his life and adventures...stories far too incredible to be true...and now the son wants the truth, darn it, so he can know dad.Okay.  Fine.  Dad tells some of his old stories again, and the movie shows them played out for us.  The son tries to dig into what really happened.  That's fine too.  But nowhere do we really understand WHY the son needs this (Billy Crudup plays him like the world's biggest party-pooper...he just wants to take dad down a notch or two it would appear).  Dad (played in old age by Albert Finney) clings to his stories, but never seems to acknowledge that his son wants to know if they are true or not.  He just keeps telling them.  He never says ""Yeah, they're true,"" or ""no, they ain't"" or even ""what do you thing?""  He just tells them. With a twinkle in his eye, true, but he's just a frustrating old-cuss who apparently has not learned to really connect with people.  We hear him talk about the ""love of his life,""  yet he marries her, finds a job as a traveling salesman, and is hardly ever home to be with the woman he went to huge lengths to win.  And she seems to just glow with love for him...yet we have NO idea why she would love him.  Again, Burton fails to reveal any truths about the human heart.  He's just messing with his viewer.Many of these stories are amusing, true, but there are plenty that aren't all that interesting either.  The mysterious forest that McGregor goes through when he leaves town are phony, phony, phony.  Feel like rejects from the set of Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW.  Anyway, what of the performances by the VERY promising cast?BILLY CRUDUP is just boring and unlikeable. Right up to the end.  Even when he comes to some sort of ""realization"" that kinda makes no sense.ALBERT FINNEY, one of my absolute favorite actors of all time, is okay but unmemorable.  JESSICA LANGE, as Finney's wife, has very little to do but look loving.ALISON LOHMAN, as the younger Lange, has a great blend of freshness and ""spunk.""  She was great in MATCHSTICK MEN and good in WHITE OLEANDER, and her winning streak continues here.  HELENA BONHAM CARTER is okay in a strange role as one of the many people McGregor meets.And what of Ewan McGregor?  He's another very fine actor, but he's lost here.  I feel like I'm watching his ""fake"" character from the amusing DOWN WITH LOVE dropped into this film. The over-the-top accent and goofy smile are EXACTLY the same. As appealing as McGregor is (he just seems like such a nice guy!), his work in BIG FISH is disappointing.The whole movie is disappointing.

804779,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B0001GOH6Q,Robert Graves,"[12, 17]","After seeing Big Fish on DVD, my first reaction was to wonder why so many people love the film. It's a story about Will, a grown man who has grown apart from his father, Ed. Will is constantly embarrassed in public by his father who insists on telling the most outrageous and unbelievable stories to everyone he meets. Will believes none of them, yet Ed insists they are completely true, and as a result Will feels like he doesn't know his father whatsoever. Ed is then diagnosed with a terminal illness, and the movie unfolds as Will tries to find out the truth about his dad.While I heard there ""wasn't a dry eye in the house"" from everyone who saw it, the film just didn't move me. It's filled with somewhat clich?d and thinly veiled symbolism, and is permeated with inconsistent metaphors. It's sort of like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for idiots - people can leave feeling like they just actually enjoyed an ""art"" film that wasn't actually an art film. Here is how the film fails.Early in the movie Ed sees how he is going to die, and realizes from that moment on he can survive anything. Everything except the audience's interest for the rest of the film - because he knows (and you know) throughout the movie that he isn't going to die until a certain point, he handles every situation with a completely drama-less attitude, knowing he'll live through it. He parachutes into the middle of a Japanese army, walks straight through the webs of poisonous spiders, robs a bank, faces a man-eating giant, etc. - all because he knows he won't die doing it. Therefore every scene is pretty much void of drama since you know he'll survive, and since he behaves recklessly knowing he'll survive as well. To me, that's a pretty boring hero. A hero is only heroic when there's real danger involved and Ed never faces real danger because he always knows he'll live through it. I just couldn't get behind him.Besides this, he constantly abandoned his family - including the woman that he paylessly worked at a circus for three years to find because he ""loved"" her so much - to go on his little adventures. I don't really see how I can respect that in a character. He supposedly has the woman of his dreams, and then leaves her home alone so he can go fix up some other woman's house for her. Continuing with the characters, Will is a completely humorless jerk who treated his father badly. Furthermore, when will has his ""transformation"" at the end of the movie, there was really nothing to trigger it. Sure he had found some papers in his father's shed to validate some of the stories and he had talked to the woman from Specter, but there was nothing to suggest that he had totally been changed and bought into his father's philosophy. As a result, the ending felt like completely contrived schlock to me. It was just ""time for character transformation in 3...2...1...now,"" with no lead up to it at all.There really isn't a conceivable story line to follow either. It just felt completely random and absurd. Perhaps that's what people liked about - for me, I prefer at least a semblance of story in a film. Burton just used gimmick after gimmick instead of telling a real story. We're hearing Jenny tell about Ed driving to Specter when he hit a severe thunderstorm, and then, while I foolishly expect a story to develop out of it, he's suddenly in his car at the bottom of a sea with a naked woman swimming around, then he's staring at his car up in a tree, presumably after the water has subsided. Just when it starts to shape into a story, something completely random and absurd happens, sending the movie spiraling deeper into contrived glitter-scenes, and apparently tricking the audience into believing they just saw something meaningful.Based upon the gushing reviews of this film, even on amazon, it's hard to advise you not to see it. But if you do, try not to give in to the careful manipulation of Burton's devices and actually try to follow the film and what it's saying. In the end, it really isn't much. Basically, it's saying if you abandon your loved ones to pursue your own fantasies, everyone will love you in the end.

Perhaps, this film is the best Burton has done to date- it is a weird and wonderful tale about a Father and Son, life and death and alienation and reconciliation.It is a story of Edward Bloom, masterfully played by both Albert Finney (as the elderly Bloom) and Ewan McGregor (as the younger Bloom).  You just never know where this movie is going, what is true or false.  Blooms son, Will (played by Billy Crudup) resents the time that his father spent away from home on business, he sees his fathers tall tales as a barrier to intimacy between father and son.  As an adult child Will comes home when he learns that he father is dying and attempts to discover the truth behind the tales, thinking that the truth will bring reconciliation and intimacy between father and son.  He believes that his fathers absence and tall tales were a ruse to hid a hidden life, perhaps even another family.  He cannot believe that a man who told such tales, and who was absent so much of the time could have loved his family the way he said he did. What he does discover is that sometimes the tale is better than the truth.  His father lived a mundane life as a salesmen, but in the midst of everyday life, touched the lives of hundreds of people.I was touched by the love story that supported the plot between Bloom and his wife (played by Jessica Lange).  It was good to see Lange act in an older plot.  Nothing is sadder than watching a middle aged actor trying to play the part of a young person.  One could sense the impending loss, as Bloom lay dying, that this marriage was coming to an end and each party was trying to come to grips with the inevitable conclusion of life- death.Yes, this movie deals with death, but it is a funny, engaging, touching, and both weird and wonderful.

804785,A1FPFWDC1ASYNJ,B0001GOH6Q,Rodrigo Llamozas,"[5, 8]","Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He has tall tales to tell to everyone who'll listen, and to some who won't want to. According to him, he has lived a big life, with big things, big events, big characters (literally!). And it seems everyone enjoys this tales...except for his own son, Will (Crudup).Will is mad at his father for never showing him the real person that he is, and as a result of this difference, they've spent more than three years without talking to each other. Until the day his father falls seriously ill and Will comes home in one last attempt to get to know his old man.Just as much as a story of Edward Bloom's grand persona, this is a tale about a father and a son finally seeing eye to eye.We get to meet Edward Bloom as a child, as a young man (played by McGregor) and as an old man (played by Finney) as he lives many of his adventures, from the time he met the town witch (Bonham-Carter), to the travels with Karl the giant and the meeting and wooing of this future wife Sandra (played as a young lady by Lohman and as an older woman by Lange). Throughout his life he meets amazing characters like Karl, the circus folk (including DeVito as the ringleader), the singing Chinese siamese twins, the hometown poet (Buscemi) and the people at the fabled town of Spectre.While this film deals with magical and unusual characters and situationes, this is not your average Tim Burton piece of work. Gone are the dark, moody and sometimes eerie and scary settings, replaced by warmth and fun, and a happier story than in his previous movies.The acting in the film is pretty good, especially Finney, McGregor and Crudup, but the best thing about this movie is its setting. Everything seems to be made out of some kind of magic, beautiful and shiny when things are going well, broken and dark when things go bad.If there is one thing that I could complain about, is that the film seemed a bit long.

804787,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001GOH6Q,Roland E. Zwick,"[12, 13]","""Big Fish"" is the latest bit of calculated whimsy from famed director Tim Burton.  With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one ""big fish story"" after another.  Now old and facing death, Bloom needs to come up with a rousing finale to cap off his largely fictionalized life.  Bloom's son, William, a realist and pragmatist, bitterly resents the ""lies"" his father has been feeding him ever since he was a boy, and yearns, in these last moments together, to hear the ""true"" story of the old man's life.  But, in his investigation into the veracity of all the tall tales he's been told, William discovers that there may be more truth to these myths and legends than he has ever allowed himself to believe.  He also realizes that, in debunking all the whoppers, he will be depriving his father of the one real trait that defines him as a person and that distinguishes him from everybody else.The title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously.  On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character.  On the other, Bloom is, himself, the ""big fish"" in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him.  ""Big Fish"" is actually most effective in the scenes set in the present, as father and son come to terms with the quality that each dislikes most about the other.  William feels deceived by a father who, despite the fact that he made himself appear to be a larger-than-life heroic figure, was actually just a mediocre, often-absent dad, too busy with his secret ""fantasy"" life to make time for his own lonely son (the story has strong echoes of ""Death of a Salesman"" in its underlying vision and theme).  Bloom, in a similar way, finds his son lacking in the kind of large-scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.The film is considerably less successful in the ""flashback"" scenes tracing Bloom's life from his own birth to his son's early childhood.  The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner - filled with hauntingly mythical settings, surrealistic events and doses of Magic Realism - but the filmmakers can't overcome the unfortunate fact that these sequences are essentially as uninteresting and irritating as real ""fish stories"" tend to be.  Bloom's ""adventures"" come across as dime-novel vignettes, which is supposed to be the point, I guess, but it still means that we are squirming with impatience through large - indeed very large - stretches of the film.  Every time we come back to the present - to real, flesh-and-blood human beings - our interest picks back up.  That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.Burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion.  The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role.  Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange).

804791,A9LNWA25IM2DX,B0001GOH6Q,"R.Suarez ""R-Suarez-""","[1, 1]","Based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish tells the story of William Bloom and his reconciliation with his dying father through the stories he used to hear from his father when he was a kid. This is without a doubt one of my favorite Burton films, filled with visual moments that follow the 'Burton formula' but with a story that goes way too far from your average Burton movie. Many reviews already exist about the film itself so I will now proceed to talk about the release and explain why I gave this only 3 stars being a favorite film of mine.THE MOVIEThe movie is presented in anamorphic Widescreen 1.85:1. Color is generally consistent and looks well in HD, but not as well as it should . It would seem a if the film has been manipulated as there is a softer look in it that I do not remember seeing at the theater; close ups that should normally look detailed look way too soft and with a 'waxy' effect. Scenes that I was looking forward to see in high detail look dull and not as they should for a Bluray release (the circus sequence, the whole arrival to Spectre or the daffodil scene are two examples that come to mind) The video quality is indeed an improvement over the existing DVD, in color at least, but there is no doubt this could have looked way better than it does in this release.Audio tracks included are uncompressed English PCM 5.1 (which sounds incredible in the few scenes that take advantage of an HD sound system), English and French 5.1. Subtitles included are English, English SDH, French, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish and ThaiTHE EXTRASPrior to getting this, I owned the existing DVD release that included among the extras an audio commentary with director Tim Burton, some mini documentaries about the story and the characters as well as some other features hidden as 'Easter eggs'. Well, all those extras but the director commentary are gone in the Bluray disc. The hidden extras are also nowhere to be found, so the director commentary is pretty much the only extra feature included in this release. If you, like me, have heard a Tim Burton commentary before, you may already know you cannot expect great things from it nor interesting information, Burton passes most of the time silent and when he talks it is usually to make a joke or point out something that may not be relevant at all. Trailers of other feature films in BD are also included.Overall, an average upgrade from the DVD, if you are a person who likes to watch documentaries and extras on how a film was made, you may want to get the DVD instead or keep your copy if you already own it.

804799,AQM2ADBR0TYSO,B0001GOH6Q,Sarah Schenkkan,"[3, 4]","Based on the best-selling novel by Daniel Wallace, ""Big Fish"" brings a larger-than-life story to the screen, in such a heartwarming and unique way that it provides an escape from the numerous violent films of the fall and still manages to entertain every member of the entire family.Directed by Tim Burton (who has critically-acclaimed films such as ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" to his credit), ""Big Fish"" follows the story of Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) who has spent his entire life telling sky-high tales about his life as a young man (Ewan McGregor), and his son Will (Billy Crudup), who desperately wants to learn the difference between the fact and fiction in his stories. As Edward is bed-ridden with cancer, he tells his life story to his son, and we as the audience are swept away into a fantasy world only creatable from the imagination of Tim Burton. From touring with a circus, to one-eyed witches, giants, and conjoined twin lounge singers, the effects are stunningly creative and a literal visual feast for the eyes. Narrated by different characters throughout specific parts of the movie, it transitions through decades and experiences nearly seamlessly, and completely immerses the audience. But, unlike so many other films, the effects in ""Big Fish"" don't overpower the character studies that are explored. The love story between Edward and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) is touching, emotional, and well-portrayed, as is the tumultuous relationship between Edward and Will, which I found to be very realistic. Not only that, but the ensemble characters such as the circus ringmaster (played by Danny Devito), the long-lost poet (Steve Buscemi), and the piano teacher (Helena Bonham-Carter) are all fantastic, and add an extra punch to the storyline. Brilliant costumes and sets also illuminate the screen, and help to bring the world of Edward Bloom to life.""Big Fish"" is by far one of the most imaginative films this fall, and with a strong cast and script that satisfies every member of the family. Although it is rated PG-13 for some nudity and a fight scene, it is quite tame, and I would recommend it for even the smallest movie-goers, as they will be entertained by the magic happening on the screen.",4,"""Big Fish"" Is A Whale Of A Tale",1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,2232,"['Based', 'best-selling', 'novel', 'Daniel', 'Wallace', 'Big', 'Fish', 'larger-than-life', 'story', 'screen', 'heartwarming', 'unique', 'way', 'escape', 'numerous', 'violent', 'films', 'fall', 'still', 'entertain', 'member', 'entire', 'family.Directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'who', 'critically-acclaimed', 'films', 'such', 'Batman', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'credit', 'Big', 'Fish', 'story', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'telling', 'sky-high', 'tales', 'life', 'young', 'man', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'son', 'Will', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'who', 'desperately', 'learn', 'difference', 'fact', 'fiction', 'stories', 'Edward', 'bed-ridden', 'cancer', 'life', 'story', 'son', 'audience', 'are', 'swept', 'away', 'fantasy', 'world', 'only', 'creatable', 'imagination', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'touring', 'circus', 'one-eyed', 'witches', 'giants', 'conjoined', 'twin', 'lounge', 'singers', 'effects', 'are', 'stunningly', 'creative', 'literal', 'visual', 'feast', 'eyes', 'Narrated', 'different', 'characters', 'specific', 'parts', 'movie', 'decades', 'experiences', 'nearly', 'seamlessly', 'completely', 'audience', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'effects', 'Big', 'Fish', 'do', ""n't"", 'overpower', 'character', 'studies', 'are', 'explored', 'love', 'story', 'Edward', 'wife', 'Sandra', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'touching', 'emotional', 'well-portrayed', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Edward', 'Will', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'realistic', 'Not', 'only', 'ensemble', 'characters', 'such', 'circus', 'ringmaster', 'played', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'long-lost', 'poet', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'piano', 'teacher', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'are', 'fantastic', 'add', 'extra', 'punch', 'storyline', 'Brilliant', 'costumes', 'sets', 'also', 'illuminate', 'screen', 'help', 'bring', 'world', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'life', 'Big', 'Fish', 'far', 'one', 'most', 'imaginative', 'films', 'fall', 'strong', 'cast', 'script', 'member', 'family', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'nudity', 'fight', 'scene', 'quite', 'tame', 'would', 'recommend', 'even', 'smallest', 'movie-goers', 'will', 'be', 'entertained', 'magic', 'happening', 'screen']",N/A

While this film has entertainment value, the content is more of a serious nature. Aside from the depiction of an interesting father/son relationship, this movie also tackles vital aspects of human nature regarding the retelling of certain events, or stories that we all tell to put it simple. While these stories may seem unbelievable to some, these may be perceived by others as flat out lies.""Big Fish"" brings out the magic of the workings of our memories that while there might be even a significant underlying truth and actual events to every story, our perception and memories are also influenced and even dominated by our emotions at the time of such events and later on again when retelling and/or expressing such memories. It's the memories that nobody can steal from us and which we carry with us throughout our lives.When we share our memories, the issue is not that we retell the exact detail of actual events, but rather that we let our human nature express itself with its emotions, passions to perhaps even share our dreams with others to communicate a moral to a story or maybe even an important lesson in life. We are creative individuals and this is what makes each one of us so very interesting and valuable. That's what this film brings out in a really exceptional way and that's why it is a literal masterpiece.True, this film may not be everybody's cup of tea, but nevertheless it is a sweet story, and makes you think about yourself and other people in your life, as it is also a true classic motion picture event. The acting is absolutely superb as it is always the case with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor does a great job too. The scenery is beautiful and the photography is exceptional, and sure you will find some of Tim Burton's trademark shocking or even somewhat scary moments, but always the humorous relief.I think this motion picture has been overlooked and it is definitely a treasure in every DVD collection.",5,An exceptional Motion Picture!,1114214400,"04 23, 2005",2005,2024,"['did', 'take', 'creative', 'genius', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'put', 'story', 'unto', 'celluloid', 'film', 'entertainment', 'value', 'content', 'more', 'serious', 'nature', 'Aside', 'depiction', 'interesting', 'father/son', 'relationship', 'movie', 'also', 'vital', 'aspects', 'human', 'nature', 'regarding', 'retelling', 'certain', 'events', 'stories', 'tell', 'put', 'simple', 'stories', 'may', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'may', 'be', 'perceived', 'others', 'flat', 'lies', 'Big', 'Fish', 'out', 'magic', 'workings', 'memories', 'might', 'be', 'even', 'significant', 'underlying', 'truth', 'actual', 'events', 'story', 'perception', 'memories', 'are', 'also', 'influenced', 'even', 'dominated', 'emotions', 'time', 'such', 'events', 'later', 'again', 'when', 'retelling', 'and/or', 'expressing', 'such', 'memories', 'memories', 'nobody', 'can', 'steal', 'carry', 'lives.When', 'share', 'memories', 'issue', 'not', 'retell', 'exact', 'detail', 'actual', 'events', 'rather', 'let', 'human', 'nature', 'express', 'emotions', 'passions', 'perhaps', 'even', 'share', 'dreams', 'others', 'communicate', 'moral', 'story', 'maybe', 'even', 'important', 'lesson', 'life', 'are', 'creative', 'individuals', 'what', 'one', 'so', 'very', 'interesting', 'valuable', 'what', 'film', 'out', 'really', 'exceptional', 'way', 'why', 'literal', 'masterpiece.True', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everybody', 'cup', 'tea', 'sweet', 'story', 'think', 'other', 'people', 'life', 'also', 'true', 'classic', 'motion', 'picture', 'event', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'always', 'case', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'great', 'job', 'too', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'exceptional', 'sure', 'will', 'find', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'trademark', 'shocking', 'even', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'moments', 'always', 'humorous', 'relief.I', 'think', 'motion', 'picture', 'been', 'overlooked', 'definitely', 'treasure', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A
804802,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,B0001GOH6Q,Scott Kolecki,"[3, 3]","At the beginning of this film, I must confess that I was skeptical as to whether or not I really wanted to invest much time into it.  It seemed to meander, providing a fantastic, satyrical &quot;Burtonesque&quot; view of a world of askewed reality.  It seemed to meander some...the premise, a boy and his father, fallen out from one another due to the son's embarrassment at his father incredible stories, are reunited when the son learns that the father is dying of cancer.The balance of the movie is told in vignette flashbacks, jumping from the present day narrative to the many incredible stories of Edward Bloom, the &quot;Big Fish&quot; of the story, whose tales stretch credibility to its limits.  The film, which is so definitely Tim Burton, is also more.  Although I was slow to pick up on it at first, I came to realize that the film was, in fact, a reflection on the complex relationships between fathers and sons.  It touches on the believable infallability we all have for our fathers as children, and the &quot;fall from grace&quot; of our fathers when we discover they are as human as we are.Though the story provides plenty of whimsy, and at times, plays more like an episode of &quot;Amazing stories&quot; than anything else, at its core is a powerful story about relationships.  This is a bit of a departure from the standard Burton fare, whose narrative stories are generally pure fantasy, without a thread of realism to them...such examples include &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and even &quot;A Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;.  This story is more human than any of those, focusing not on the fantastic, but using the fantastic stories of a father whose life was incredible without the tall tales to explore the psyche of a man who never knew how to fail.In the end, this film is a great tribute to fathers and sons everywhere, and is a film worth sharing. With the approach of Father's Day, this might make for a nice gift to share with Dad, and more, it is an entertaining romp through the fascinating world of Edward Bloom, Burton's newest slightly-askew-but-ever-so-human hero.-Scott Kolecki",5,A Film For Fathers and Sons,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,2191,"['beginning', 'film', 'must', 'confess', 'was', 'skeptical', 'not', 'really', 'wanted', 'invest', 'much', 'time', 'seemed', 'meander', 'providing', 'fantastic', 'satyrical', 'quot', 'Burtonesque', 'quot', 'view', 'world', 'askewed', 'reality', 'seemed', 'meander', 'premise', 'boy', 'father', 'fallen', 'out', 'one', 'due', 'son', 'embarrassment', 'father', 'incredible', 'stories', 'are', 'reunited', 'when', 'son', 'father', 'dying', 'cancer.The', 'balance', 'movie', 'told', 'vignette', 'flashbacks', 'jumping', 'present', 'day', 'narrative', 'many', 'incredible', 'stories', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'quot', 'Big', 'Fish', 'quot', 'story', 'tales', 'stretch', 'credibility', 'limits', 'film', 'so', 'definitely', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'also', 'more', 'was', 'slow', 'pick', 'up', 'first', 'came', 'realize', 'film', 'was', 'fact', 'reflection', 'complex', 'relationships', 'fathers', 'sons', 'believable', 'infallability', 'have', 'fathers', 'children', 'quot', 'fall', 'grace', 'quot', 'fathers', 'when', 'discover', 'are', 'as', 'human', 'are.Though', 'story', 'plenty', 'whimsy', 'times', 'more', 'episode', 'quot', 'Amazing', 'stories', 'quot', 'anything', 'else', 'core', 'powerful', 'story', 'relationships', 'bit', 'departure', 'standard', 'Burton', 'fare', 'narrative', 'stories', 'are', 'generally', 'pure', 'fantasy', 'thread', 'realism', 'such', 'examples', 'include', 'quot', 'Beetlejuice', 'quot', 'quot', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'quot', 'quot', 'Batman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'quot', 'even', 'quot', 'A', 'Nightmare', 'Before', 'Christmas', 'quot', 'story', 'more', 'human', 'focusing', 'not', 'fantastic', 'using', 'fantastic', 'stories', 'father', 'life', 'was', 'incredible', 'tall', 'tales', 'explore', 'psyche', 'man', 'who', 'never', 'knew', 'how', 'fail.In', 'end', 'film', 'great', 'tribute', 'fathers', 'sons', 'everywhere', 'film', 'sharing', 'approach', 'Father', 'Day', 'might', 'make', 'nice', 'gift', 'share', 'Dad', 'more', 'entertaining', 'romp', 'fascinating', 'world', 'Edward', 'Bloom', 'Burton', 'newest', 'slightly-askew-but-ever-so-human', 'hero.-Scott', 'Kolecki']",N/A
804803,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B0001GOH6Q,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 4]","Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" spins a yarn about one of the great yarn-spinners of all time, Ed Bloom, and it does so in the enchanting fashion that makes great story-tellers proud.The present-day Bloom (played by the great Albert Finney) is in the twilight of his life, beset by cancer and soon destined to leave this mortal coil.  According to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Bloom has filled his life with telling fantastic lies embellished with ridiculous fables enhanced by Bloom's own mythical view of himself.  And Will has had enough of it, rejecting his father to work in Paris as a ""just the facts"" reporter - the duality is obvious:  Dad tells false but interesting tales, while Son writes factual-yet-drab articles.  As Will says, ""Dad, you're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined... you're just as charming, and just as fake."" Against his wishes, Will returns home to be with his dad, along with his pregnant wife, during his last days.As various characters interact with the dying Bloom, he continues to relate various tales about his past, which allows Burton to go into full flashback mode.  According to himself, the younger Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor (one of the most likable actors working today), did lead one heck of a fantastic life, replete with witches, giants, werewolves, circus performers, Siamese twins, international intrigue, romances and, of course, a really big fish.  Burton invests each of the various episodes in Bloom's past with a wonderful combination of realism and fantasy.  One thing to remember about people who live in a fantasy world - to them, it's normal, and they tend to act like normal people.  It is refreshing that for all the fantastic things Bloom saw and experienced, none of the characters appear to be too over-the-top or cartoonish.This being a Burton film, also beware his trademark black humor.  If you've seen other Burton films, it should come as no surprise that one character gets his comeuppance by having a heart attack on the john while ""reading"" a Playboy.  (And what a wonderful comeuppance it is!)Initially, Will refuses to engage his father's tales, and many stories are told to Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard).  But then Will's mom (Jessica Lange) tells Will to start going through all of his father's accumulated personal effects from his long life, and Will starts to see some proof of his father's legendary exploits.  And young Will gradually sees the wisdom in his father's penchant for exaggerating his own legends . . . and one of the movie's best moments comes when Will realizes that he's got a bit of Dad's storytelling ability running through his veins.Beautifully shot, well-written, and well-acted (although one wishes that Jessica Lange had more to do with her role), ""Big Fish"" is sure to enchant viewers who appreciate a good story, and a heart-felt ending will have more than a few viewers dabbing the corners of their eyes.The DVD has some decent extras, but nothing out of the ordinary (we're not talking about a Peter Jackson 4-DVD pack here).

Luckily, my wife was desperate to watch this film, so I was &quot;forced&quot; into watching it soon after the date of its release in DVD. I say luckily because the story is mesmerizing and the fantastic elements are fun and add a certain charisma to the film.Will (Billy Crudup) is tired of listening to his father tell stories over and over and being the center of attention in every gathering. When at Will's wedding, Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan Mc Gregor) repeats his annoying behavior by retelling the story for the nth time of how he caught a big fish, Will gets extremely angry and they get into a confrontation. This leads to three years of silence between father and son, which is only broken when Edward gets seriously ill and the doctors have no hope left for him.Will goes back with his parents' house and we get immersed into the different stories Edward told through the years, from a witch that showed him how he was going to die, to the time when he started growing extremely fast and had to spend three years in bed as a result. As the stories pile up, the son finally starts to understand who his father is and to appreciate that which has bothered him for so long.Tim Burton leads us through a labyrinth of myths and legends, with skillful storytelling and scenes that will make even the toughest of you feel emotional and maybe drop a tear or two.

Growing up, Will (Billy Crudup) idealized his father, believing all of his incredible, tall tales of adventure - even including his own dramatic birth.Now in his thirties, married and with a baby of his own on the way, Will must now tie up loose ends with his father who is dying of cancer.  Edward Bloom (as a young man, Ewan McGregor, present day portrayal by Albert Finney) seems to touch success everywhere he goes, not having much himself, but enriching the lives of those around him. His sweet smile and positive outlook make him not only an effective salesman of useless household objects, but a salesman of himself and his &quot;big fish&quot; stories.Disgusted wih his father's apparent allergic reaction to telling a simple fact instead of a tall tale, Will has let 3 years pass without a word between them, but now must face the reality that time is now his worst enemy.  Will finally confronts his father, telling him, &quot;I don't know who you are.&quot; Will leaves in a huff, and going through his father's papers, begins to investigate the truth of his father's past.As Will begins to unravel the tapestry his father has woven, he finds that &quot;not everything (he) has said is a complete fabrication&quot; as his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him... and some of the most unbelievable of his stories turn out to be very true, albeit sometimes a little exaggerated.  Will finds himself turning back into that young, believing child - rebuilding even a bigger pedestal to place his father upon - the opposite of what he expected.It's easy to understand Will's resentment - his own mother, while not telling her own tall tales, never seems to be a voice of reason - expecting a young child to grow up not knowing what is real - her sole focus in life seems to be on her husband, and very little focus is on raising the little human they've created together.Those who have recently lost a loved one may find a poignant scene between the father and son a little too close to home, a truly bittersweet moment of heart-wrenching reconciliation.Lots of light hearted moments and tongue-in-cheek scenes break what little tension the viewer experiences.

Living in France with his pregnant wife, Will hurries home when his mother (Jessica Lange) tells him that his father is dying and that it is only a matter of time.  Will tries to have some serious conversations with his father about who he really is, but all he can get out of him are these tall tales that used to entertain Will when he was a child, but now that he is grown up, he doesn't believe in them anymore.  There are stories about a young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) having the golden touch in his small hometown and winning at everything.  Stories of how he lured a giant out of town and fought his way through a swamp to a forgotten Eden of a town.  Stories of how he worked for the circus and won the information about the girl he fell in love with at first sight.  So many stories, but all of them so fantastical that they simply couldn't be true!  But as his father continues to slip away, Will comes to realize that there is some truth in every story and that, given the choice, wouldn't we all prefer the story with a little bit of magic woven in...?Big Fish was an unexpectedly charming drama that was not quite as fantastical as I envisioned given the previews.  It is very much a father/son relationship movie and it was sweet to see both the father and the son come to some important realizations in the film.  The Blooms are a very loving family and Will's parents were still madly in love when he died, which is so refreshing to see in a film these days.  Of course, we see Edward Burton's touch mostly in the flashbacks where Ewan McGregor plays Edward Bloom as he has so many amazing adventures and these sequences really added to the film and made it something special instead of commonplace.

The cause of this is William's annoyance (and, one senses, jealousy) at his father's incredible gift for magical storytelling. The pair flashback to relieve fantastical, biographical elements of his father's life as a boy and young man. Ewan Mcgregor plays the young Edward Bloom with a kookiness and idealistic charm although at times he fails to come across with the necessary larger than life charisma that is required of the role.The central message of Big Fish is the posing of the question- is it important to tell the truth, or can beautifully told stories become part of a person's character and life as much as the actual events in their life? This exploration ultimately seems rather shallow in the end.

When doctors find that Edward is dying, Will flies back home to be with the man he never understood, in some effort to know the man, and not the stories he told.  What Will learns throughout the course of the film is that the man is the stories he told.When Edward tells about the day that Will was born, he creates a story about a BIG FISH that he caught using his wedding ring as bait.  Will hates the story and knows the truth, that his father was a travelling salesman, and he was out of town when Will was born.  Edward adds color to the story because it means something to him, and the metaphor of the Big Fish is self-evident.

Wilson ""Author: Animal Movies Guide ...","[1, 2]","A modern-day Homer, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) has always been a teller of tales about his astonishing life as a younger man (Ewan McGregor). Going back and forth in time, director Tim Burton takes a dip into the realms of realism and fairy tales revealing the life of a man who never wanted to be a big fish in a little pond. Edward's penchant for adventure takes him from his small hometown in the deep South, around the world, and then back again. Along the way he meets a witch with a magical glass eye, a hungry giant, jumping spiders, conjoined twins, a playful werewolf, and many more characters, including his future wife.

Tim Burton has always had a knack for taking bizarre subject matter and making a heartwarming movie out of it(like Edward Scissorhands).  Burton has certainly redeemed himself here after that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations!  Feel it, feel it!).  It's a whimsical, bizarre, funny fantasy with just the right amount of sappiness thrown in.  Some people might think the movie's just plain weird, but the human interest aspect of the story should overshadow the goofiness.  Interestingly enough, the opposite is true;  If you're too much of a man, the fantasy element is plentiful enough to make you forget about the touching father/son drama being played out.  Pretty well balanced if you ask me.  It doesn't look like other Burton films, most of this is in the daylight.  That's small potatoes coz his humor and style do still shine through.

They live on after him and in that way he becomes immortal."" Fiction as a vehicle for passing on mundane facts that in themselves are not worth telling, but nonetheless are part of who we are. The value is not so much in the facts themselves, but in the storytelling. Has anyone ever personally met God, or visited heaven? Has the absence of a factual basis prevented people from happily entertaining this notion as another reality? This film is about the exploits, real or imagined, of Ed Bloom, a fascinating, larger-than-life character who is loved by all. He has the uncanny ability to suspend disbelief in favor of wonder every time he tells a story. And these stories, loaded with imagination and wit, are animated by wonderful performances by an exemplary cast that engender their characters with life, rendering them almost believable. The narrator of the film is Ed Bloom's son Will, who attempts to discredit the stories as complete fiction, and therefore of little value. He is an embittered skeptic, who as an adult resents his father for taking advantage of his childhood innocence by having filled his head with lies and deception. Since the stories bring so much joy to the listener, and to us as viewers, they are much more satisfying to accept at face value; therefore, when Will admonishes them with scientific scrutiny, it is not the storyteller who ends up looking foolish and deceptive. In THE BIG FISH Tim Burton has created a masterpiece of fantasy that is firmly grounded in human relations, especially the complex relationship between a father and a son and the understated emotional bond between a husband and a wife.

You will either love it or hate it because it's just plain sincere and straight forward. I found albert finney to be as charismatic as ever. Ewan McGregor, was a bit type cast, but he's good at playing the perfect guy. It's the most un-tim burton, tim burton has ever been. Which adds to the movies unique look and feel. He allows his imagination to grace the screen but unlike things like Kill Bill it never distracts from the over all experience. Tim Burton said he made this movie as therapy for losing his parents recently. And that what this movie feels like, good medicine. I recently had a scare with my mom going to the hospital, and this movie really made me feel better.The stories, this is the meat of the movie. They are fantastic. They are funny. I believe they really happened. They are hauntingly surreal and are as intriguing to watch as they must have been to hear. This is where the movie takes off and sweeps you off your feet. I won't ruin  stories themselves but they were a complete delight to behold. So much so, that the scenes in between them tend to drag on until the next tall tale comes along.My criticism are few but if I had to nit pick I would say that the cynical son is almost TOO cynical, and it's really stupid as to WHY he doesn't talk to his father anymore. But when he starts to soften up, that falls to the way side. The movie starts off a little strange, the editing could have been tighter and basically when we dont see albert finney or his younger self things definetly slow down on screen. It has its flaws.And last but not least, the Pearl Jam song in the credits...PERFECT. I smell a best song oscar for Eddie Vedder and crew.Good Job Tim. Sweet movie. Don't get so hyped about it folks.

804835,A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,B0001GOH6Q,Takis Tz.,"[13, 14]","I found it exceedingly hard to give this film a rating, even those 4 stars i decided for i'm not absolutely certain about, it could easily have been a 3-star decision or a a 5-star even.The reason for this is that ""Big Fish"" is a tricky proposition to make up your mind about. The fact that many reviewers either absolutely love it or found it tedious is attesting to that notion.While ""Big Fish"" is on the surface a film about a father in his dying days narrating the incredible and zany stories of his life and a son who tries to find out if these stories have any truth in them and simoultaneously learn who his father really was before he dies, there's quite many underlying and very significant questions and issues that this film deals with.To begin with, we as viewers never really find out with any certainty if these stories are indeed true, but instead we are ""trained"" through the course of the movie to think with father Gloom's mindset, that is:""it doesn't really matter if they are true, it only matters that they make a good story"".And then just when you think that's all there is, you realise that this film is like an onion really as another layer reveals itself to you:""but isn't reality a matter of total subjectivity, and that what one person perceives as real the next person might think of as complete nonsense""?And yet who's to say what the answers ""really"" are? Big Fish walks , in my opinion, a very tight rope, and having to maintain a very precarious balance it does incredibly well.After the disaster of the ""Planet of the Apes"", Burton comes up in a domain where he does best: one between dream and reality where the borders are not only blurry but there might not be borders alltogether. It's all very ""fortean"" in concept, but Burton has proven in other films in his past that he can deal with this domain quite succesfully.Aside of the premise of the film (which again, will be perceived by a lot of viewers differently) this is a cinematic masterpiece as Burton brings to life the old school of grand-moviemaking to life.Alone the stunning depictions of the stories of father Gloom are cinema at its dreamy bestand this complimented by a cast headed by McGregor who ultimately finds a vehicle for the performance of his life make up for a not easy to forget film.The rest of the cast is up to par as well. Father Gloom played by Finney is a wonderful zesty character, as well as his wife played by a graciously aging J.Lange. De Vito and Buscemi, even in second leads, remind us easily why they belong to that league of premier actors.Sure enough, were this film to be taken literally, there are quite some plot holes, to name one example, why would a woman be so terribly in love with someone who was basically never there?But, this is exactly the trick here.

Couldn't figure out why in the film it was about the shoes.However, I loved the relationship between Edward and Sandra Bloom - both as young people and as older folks.

The fantasy elements are overdone, while the reality segments are underdeveloped. This central conceit of the film works against it, as does the erratic casting - I didn't believe for one second that Billy Crudup was Albert Finney's son, an insurmountable problem for me - Jessica Lange is wasted, and only Ewan McGregor is both properly cast and impressive in his performance. The finale, which aspires to be tear-inducing, falls flat because we never really see Crudup's character going through the process of coming to terms with his imperfect father - he just does a final-reel turnaround to provide a forced ""audience-pleasing"" and predictable finale.

804839,A2HW4GC6H0L2LR,B0001GOH6Q,"T. George ""anne-with-an-e""","[0, 1]","Well, I guess I would say that this film is one small step for Burton but one large step for post-modernism in film.  (Post-modernism being a reaction against the rationality, supremacy of facts, easy answers, simplified thinking, ""the norm"", etc. of scientific modernist thinking)By that I mean that Burton has added a new piece this his distinct collection, and this piece might be found lacking.  I fully agree with Thomas Bumbera's review below.  Bumbera brings up really good points, and his analysis is thorough.  The storyline was a bit choppy, and some characters were so flat I thought the breeze would knock them over.HOWEVER, I was so enraptured by the film that I think that such criticisms (which are usually important to me) fall by the wayside.  What Burton has done with this film is visionary and new.  And, while it does have problems, I think that's maybe due to the fact that he's simply one of the first in a new frontier.What's so new about this film?  I think Burton (using his already acknowledged unique genius) is the first to fully embrace post-modernism in a many-leveled manner using a variety of dimensions available in film.  I've seen several other films that have taken shaky first steps into the post-modernist world - ""Chocolat"" challenged the norm as far as morals; ""Magnolia"" loaded itself with complexity, pain, and hard realities; ""Adaptation"" pulled out all the stops in screwing with the logic & chronology of the movie plot.However, these forerunners in the post-modernist era fall short of what Burton accomplished.  He takes you through Ed Bloom's unbelievable stories in a world that looks very similar to our own.  But, rather than just exist in this fantastical world, he challenges you to reconcile it with ""the real world.""  Did any of this happen?  Was the old Ed Bloom ever like his very endearing younger self?  Were these stories a cover-up for affairs that he had while gone?  Was this man simply an egomaniac?Your one ambassador in this mind-bending investigation is Ed Bloom's son, Will Bloom, because he is the rational mind trying to separate fact from fiction.  He says everything you would say if you were given the assignment to figure out who Ed Bloom was & what was true about him.  (And because of the need for this son's character & the emotional complexity he brings to the storyline, I am willing to forgive some choppiness and unnaturally speedy character development.)As you and the son investigate the facts behind the story, you find that you tire of the son & his investigations.  Rather, you long for more of his father's adventures, which are full of unexpected people, Burton-esque places and understated intelligence.  If Burton uses this boredom with reality like I think he is, then this is one example of his many-leveled approach to develop his attack on rationality.Personally, I became a committed fan of the film when the son, Will Burton, is interviewing Jessica Hill.  Both her character & story are well-done, but what she represents is a key to the puzzle.  I loved the dimensions she adds to what ""makes sense"".  Like the rest of the movie, she unveils a logic existing in the fantastic that is in some ways superior to cold, dry scientific logic.I think what Burton introduces the audience to is somewhat akin to what Catholics call the mystique and mystery of God.  I was very taken by this post-modernist exploration.",5,So Big It's Hard to Wrap Your Arms Around...,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,3408,"['Well', 'guess', 'would', 'say', 'film', 'one', 'small', 'step', 'Burton', 'one', 'large', 'step', 'post-modernism', 'film', 'Post-modernism', 'being', 'reaction', 'rationality', 'supremacy', 'facts', 'easy', 'answers', 'simplified', 'thinking', 'norm', 'etc', 'scientific', 'modernist', 'thinking', 'mean', 'Burton', 'added', 'new', 'piece', 'distinct', 'collection', 'piece', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'lacking', 'fully', 'agree', 'Thomas', 'Bumbera', 'review', 'Bumbera', 'up', 'really', 'good', 'points', 'analysis', 'thorough', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'choppy', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'flat', 'thought', 'breeze', 'would', 'knock', 'was', 'so', 'enraptured', 'film', 'think', 'such', 'criticisms', 'are', 'usually', 'important', 'fall', 'wayside', 'What', 'Burton', 'done', 'film', 'visionary', 'new', 'have', 'problems', 'think', 'maybe', 'due', 'fact', 'simply', 'one', 'first', 'new', 'frontier.What', 'so', 'new', 'film', 'think', 'Burton', 'using', 'already', 'acknowledged', 'unique', 'genius', 'first', 'fully', 'embrace', 'post-modernism', 'many-leveled', 'manner', 'using', 'variety', 'dimensions', 'available', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'taken', 'shaky', 'first', 'steps', 'post-modernist', 'world', 'Chocolat', 'challenged', 'norm', 'as', 'far', 'morals', 'Magnolia', 'loaded', 'complexity', 'pain', 'hard', 'realities', 'Adaptation', 'pulled', 'out', 'stops', 'screwing', 'logic', 'chronology', 'movie', 'plot.However', 'forerunners', 'post-modernist', 'era', 'fall', 'short', 'what', 'Burton', 'accomplished', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'unbelievable', 'stories', 'world', 'very', 'similar', 'own', 'rather', 'just', 'exist', 'fantastical', 'world', 'reconcile', 'real', 'world', 'Did', 'happen', 'Was', 'old', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'ever', 'very', 'endearing', 'younger', 'self', 'Were', 'stories', 'cover-up', 'affairs', 'had', 'gone', 'Was', 'man', 'simply', 'egomaniac', 'one', 'ambassador', 'mind-bending', 'investigation', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'son', 'Will', 'Bloom', 'rational', 'mind', 'trying', 'separate', 'fact', 'fiction', 'everything', 'would', 'say', 'were', 'given', 'assignment', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'true', 'need', 'son', 'character', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'storyline', 'am', 'willing', 'forgive', 'choppiness', 'unnaturally', 'speedy', 'character', 'development', 'son', 'investigate', 'facts', 'story', 'find', 'tire', 'son', 'investigations', 'Rather', 'long', 'more', 'father', 'adventures', 'are', 'full', 'unexpected', 'people', 'Burton-esque', 'places', 'understated', 'intelligence', 'Burton', 'boredom', 'reality', 'think', 'then', 'one', 'example', 'many-leveled', 'approach', 'develop', 'attack', 'rationality.Personally', 'became', 'committed', 'fan', 'film', 'when', 'son', 'Will', 'Burton', 'interviewing', 'Jessica', 'Hill', 'character', 'story', 'are', 'well-done', 'what', 'key', 'puzzle', 'loved', 'dimensions', 'what', 'sense', 'rest', 'movie', 'logic', 'existing', 'fantastic', 'ways', 'superior', 'cold', 'dry', 'scientific', 'logic.I', 'think', 'what', 'Burton', 'audience', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'what', 'Catholics', 'call', 'mystique', 'mystery', 'God', 'was', 'very', 'taken', 'post-modernist', 'exploration']",N/A

He brings his pregnant wife Josephine with him, and he will speak with his father in the first time in years. Will's problem with his dad stem from his father always stealing the show at the most important moments of his life, and the fact that he never knew who his father really was, because all he was ever told were elaborate tales of giants and witches and mysterious cities in the middle of nowhere. The goal of Will, played excellently by Billy Crudup (one of the most underrated actors out there, see ""Almost Famous"" and ""Jesus' Son"") is to sort out who is father really is.The father is played by Albert Finney, and Ewan McGregor when he is younger. Both actors take the tall tales and run with them, and both of them come away with very strong performances.""Big Fish"" is the story of leading a huge life, even when it may have been duller than expected. It is the story of a man coming to terms with who his father was, or wasn't, and about the innocence of children dissapearing when the stories of their parents grow old and tiresome. There are so many layers to this movie, each one could be dissected for hours.The direction here is top-notch, as Burton stuns again with his creative vision.

Now that his father is nearing the end of his life, William takes it upon himself to determine who his father actually was, what he actually did, and how he actually led his life.

However, the way the director presents the story and all the adventures of the father makes the movie pleasant and fresh in a way that it is a fairy tale inside a fairy tale!! The actors help by the way...It's good to see great directors make great movies not for the box office but for those who like to see something different and genuine (I hope i spelled the world correctly!!)Bravo!!!!",5,A Tim Burton touch of art,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,927,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'greatest', 'story', 'teller', 'today', 'modern', 'movie', 'industry', 'together', 'Spielberg', '.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'budget', 'film', 'supposed', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'romantic', 'nostalgic', 'commedy', 'softness', 'Forest', 'Gump', 'travels', 'Baron', 'Von', 'Minhaouzen', 'making', 'movie', 'heart', 'creator.The', 'basic', 'element', 'story', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'really', 'mostly', 'relationsip', 'father', 'son', 'However', 'way', 'director', 'story', 'adventures', 'father', 'movie', 'pleasant', 'fresh', 'way', 'fairy', 'tale', 'fairy', 'tale', 'actors', 'help', 'way', 'good', 'see', 'great', 'directors', 'make', 'great', 'movies', 'not', 'box', 'office', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'genuine', 'hope', 'i', 'spelled', 'world', 'correctly', 'Bravo']",N/A

I grew up watching Burton's films, with ""Frankenweenie"", and soon after the first ""Pee Wee Herman"" film. As much as I love Tim Burton's films, the one that stands alone is ""Big Fish"". To me, this is his best work...his ""Citizen Kane"". It's the unltimate feel-good film, the ultimate fairy tale. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but I believe the central point of the film is to repair a broken relationship between a father & son, played to precision by Albert Finney & Billy Crudup. Much of Finney's life is shown in flashbacks, where he is portrayed by Ewan MacGregor (who in turn was a fine choice of casting!). Scenes of extraordinary characters & storytelling is what makes the film so wonderful. Through all of it's craziness, the main theme I believe is love. Finney's wife is played by Jessica Lange, who is fantastic as well. The supporting cast helps make the film so powerful too, with a big highlight going out to Danny DeVito, who as usual, gives a strong performance.All in all, do not miss this film.

804846,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B0001GOH6Q,Timothy Kearney,"[3, 3]","The most common review of BIG FISH from friends who viewed the film was something along the lines of ""I am surprised I liked it as much as I did."" Since I had a more positive reaction to the film than I did to its theatrical trailer, I can understand this point of view. The trailer struck me as a bit bizarre, and the dialogue used in the trailer made it seem clich&eacute;. For this reason I did not plan to see the movie, but when I was given the DVD as a gift, I figured I had no choice, so I watched the film and can honestly say I enjoyed it.The plot is rather simple. Father and son love each other but are conflicted, father and son have falling out, and father and son reunite when dear old dad gets ill. The story itself could either be hackneyed or used creatively. In BIG FISH, the latter is the case and creativity is the key that makes the movie interesting. In resolving the conflict, the son begins to gradually understand and appreciate the father, and this happens in a natural manner. Ewan McGreggor, and Albert Finney are masterful as the young and older Ed Bloom. Billy Crudup is a compelling and believable Will Bloom. Jessica Lange, Robert Guillaume, Danny De Vito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alison Lohman also star in the film as supporting cast and do admirably. The fanciful tales of the movie are glitzy and create a magical atmosphere. The mini stories within the larger story are also in keeping with the character of Ed Bloom. Director Tim Burton has reason to be pleased with much of the film.While there is much to praise about the film, there are a few drawbacks. While it was only a little over two hours in length, it did seem to drag at certain points. The sub-stories were larger than life, which would be in keeping with a larger than life character like Ed Bloom. As interesting as the sub-stories were, they did seem at times to be a bit to many and in some cases, the stories were a bit prolonged. In other films this could mean death, but in BIG FISH, there are so many other redeeming qualities, these are merely items that make it less than perfect.Enjoy!!!",4,Enjoyable Film That Is A Times Larger Than Life,1084665600,"05 16, 2004",2004,2101,"['most', 'common', 'review', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'friends', 'who', 'viewed', 'film', 'was', 'something', 'lines', 'am', 'surprised', 'liked', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'had', 'more', 'positive', 'reaction', 'film', 'did', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'can', 'understand', 'point', 'view', 'trailer', 'struck', 'bit', 'bizarre', 'dialogue', 'used', 'trailer', 'made', 'seem', 'clich', 'eacute', 'reason', 'did', 'not', 'plan', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'given', 'DVD', 'gift', 'figured', 'had', 'choice', 'watched', 'film', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'it.The', 'plot', 'rather', 'simple', 'Father', 'son', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'conflicted', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'falling', 'out', 'father', 'son', 'reunite', 'when', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'ill', 'story', 'could', 'either', 'be', 'hackneyed', 'used', 'creatively', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'latter', 'case', 'creativity', 'key', 'movie', 'interesting', 'resolving', 'conflict', 'son', 'gradually', 'understand', 'appreciate', 'father', 'natural', 'manner', 'Ewan', 'McGreggor', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'are', 'masterful', 'young', 'older', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'compelling', 'believable', 'Will', 'Bloom', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Robert', 'Guillaume', 'Danny', 'De', 'Vito', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'also', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'do', 'admirably', 'fanciful', 'tales', 'movie', 'are', 'glitzy', 'create', 'magical', 'atmosphere', 'mini', 'stories', 'larger', 'story', 'are', 'also', 'keeping', 'character', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'Director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'reason', 'be', 'pleased', 'much', 'film.While', 'much', 'praise', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'drawbacks', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'length', 'did', 'seem', 'drag', 'certain', 'points', 'sub-stories', 'were', 'larger', 'life', 'would', 'be', 'keeping', 'larger', 'life', 'character', 'Ed', 'Bloom', 'As', 'interesting', 'sub-stories', 'were', 'did', 'seem', 'times', 'be', 'bit', 'many', 'cases', 'stories', 'were', 'bit', 'prolonged', 'other', 'films', 'could', 'mean', 'death', 'BIG', 'FISH', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'are', 'merely', 'items', 'make', 'less', 'perfect.Enjoy']",N/A
804847,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,B0001GOH6Q,Timothy Michael Resh,"[1, 1]","Tim Burton is a master of movies that blur genre lines.  Burton's Batman and Batman Returns were action-adventure-superhero movies with a twist of black humor provided by Nicholson's Joker and DeVito's Penguin, respectively.  Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow were horror-comedies, and Mars Attacks was kitsch-scifi-comedy.  I could go on, but will get to the point.  Big Fish contains elements of tragedy, comedy, adventure, fantasy, and drama, and mixes them up into a delightful and sensitive tall tale unlike any of Burton's other works.The casting is immaculate: Ewan McGregor makes a great younger version of Albert Finney, and Allison Lohman is a dead ringer for a young Jessica Lange.  Other members of this stellar cast include Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Billy Crudup, Helena Bonham Carter, and Robert Guillaume.Although the story is a bit uneven at times, spending a few moments too long in the fantastical reconstructions of Finney's youth, the stories are so worthwhile and entertaining that the viewer is willing to overlook this shortcoming.  The movie also runs a bit long at just over two hours, but the final scenes tie the movie together neatly and give the viewer a sense of completeness and satisfaction with the outcome.The primary theme of the film is the stories that we tell and how they affect other people's lives, a topic in which I have long had a casual interest.  A secondary, but nonetheless important theme is one of a son reconciling with, coming to grips with, and ultimately accepting his father for who he is, not who the son wants his father to be.  This theme alone makes the film worthwhile, and causes the viewer to reflect on his or her own parental relationship.Viewed with a less critical eye, the movie is still very entertaining and the sort of wildly imaginative story to which only Burton could do justice.

We are never ahead or in a better position then Will, the son to judge if what we see is plain fantasy or if there are ""bits and pieces"" of truth in what we see and he heard from his dad... Off course, everything seems like a long fantastical story, but here and there, especially towards the end of the movie, we get some hints that maybe some of these fantastical tales could have really happened. So where does this leave us and is it really important to know? We remain uncertain, but undergo the same process as the son, and learn to appreciate other things but the mere ""truth"".It seems that the only real ""reality"" in this movie are the very real emotions: shame, anger, love, jealousy are depicted in a way that makes us believe. Especially believable is the strained relationship between father and son. This is transferred  during ""Big Fish"" beginning moments, which give the viewer the whole problematic situation.... Indeed what can you do with a father that insists on being always on center stage, even on his son's wedding night? Personally, I can't stand the type... The son, telling the story, seems to be warning the viewers in advance ""beware...do not fall for this guy (as everyone else does)""... but then takes you to a journey that ends with you, the viewer, just like the son, falling in love with Edward Bloom's character and storytelling in general.A key element in the film lies with the witch's ""eye"" telling ""how one is going to die"". Although we get to see what the ""eye"" tells two other kids, we never know how Edward Bloom is going to end his life (or at least what the ""eye"" said about it), so we never know if the ""eye"" did tell the truth and hence if the story was true. I believe this to be a key element as the knowledge of ""how I am going to die"" (or rather ""I am not going to die from other things"") seems to be a main element in Bloom's life and a knowledge that let him be the fearless character he was - at least according to his stories.All stories are heard with wide-open eyes but are not believed. Nor by the son nor by us, the viewers.... In the end I believe that what the movie is trying to say is that maybe our belief is not so important. If this is your story... well then let it be. Or maybe the message is ""Live hard and die hard"". Live with all your might and love with all your might. Live it to the full.The film is best regarded as a lovely fantasy tale with many bizarre creatures that people of all ages can enjoy. My young sons, watching the movie with me, loved the witch, the giant and the twins... But other then that this is also a story of coming to terms with whom you really are, after finding out what your heritage is really...and then learning to accept it as it is.

Now old Edward does it again, before Will's wedding guests and Will himself, who begins to find his daddy too annoying these days.But the day comes when Will realizes that Edward is not all lying -- actually, the stories he told were all based on truth.  On the deathbed of Edward, he recounts the days of his youth, the romance with his wife, and a little secret about the town of &quot;Spectre.&quot;The strength of &quot;Big Fish&quot; is its visual flair, and the director is Tim Burton.  The picture is filled with his imagination, which is greatly helped by the able cast including, besides McGregor and Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman as Edward's love Sandra, and Danny Devito.  Jessica Lange plays older Sandra while Will by Billy Crudup.Again I say the visual is great because the stories Edward tells us tend to be repetitive, and its contents are not always interesting, or 'big' enough.  Some episodes are not necessary while some look mercilessly shortened, especially the one about the girl 'Jenny' who is incredibly cute.  Burton keeps on his tales, and they mostly work, but he needs more careful selection and less running time to produce the same effect.Still, the film is moving when it concentrate on its theme -- the relations between the characters, the father and the son in particular.  I don't buy the idea of casting McGregor as Edward from Alabama, but as his resembrance with Finney would justify it.

Living a life of wonder and fascination should not stop when we leave childhood through the harrowing door of puberty. We should always live our lives with a childlike faith, always curious, always wanting to explore. BIG FISH is also a film that raises some interesting questions. What is real?  Where does one separate the fact from the fiction? Or, perhaps the things that seem most fantastical are actually the things most real and true.The movie briefly tells the story of one Edward Bloom, a life-long stroyteller who finds himself on his deathbed suffering from a debilitating disease after living a very full life.  Bloom's only child is a newspaper reporter who has grown tired of his father's tall tales. After years of not speaking with his father and staying away from home, he returns home after he learns of his father's impending death. The son comes home to confront his Dad but is forced to rethink his own beliefs about what makes a fact and what is truly real.Ewan McGregor plays the younger version of Bloom and his performance is what holds the film together as it weaves from the past to the present and from fantasy and reality.  Also, Danny DeVito makes an impressive turn in an interesting supporting role as a circus ringmaster with a strange disease.The movie was directed by Tim Burton and it's nice to see Burton getting back to movies he enjoys making. Tim Burton is the only director in Hollywood who can effectively tell a story through images without much of a (or even any) screenplay.Overall, BIG FISH is a fun film to watch. It's full of beautiful subtleties. It has a good message and though is fantastical, seems more down-to-Earth than many of Burton's other pictures (e.g. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS).

Marshall,"[4, 5]","This is an amazing adult fairy tale filmed by the ever impressive imagination of Tim Burton with several great messages contained within the disguise of an old man's dreams.Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying but he refuses to leave behind his tall tales about all of the situations he has encountered in his life. His wife (Jessica Lange) remains humored by her husband's fantasy life but is troubled that her son cannot seem to warm up to this extraordinary man. Edward's son Will Bloom (Billy Cudrup) has grown weary of his father's inability to deal with reality and is sick of hearing about oversized fish, perfect Southern towns, spectacular circuses, Siamese twins, glass eyes that see the future, haunted forests and gentle giants who don't exist. But upon returning home for his father's final days Will warms up to the possibility of his father's life as he sees it. With flash backs to Edward's youth (played by Ewan McGregor) all the tales seem come to new life.This is a wonderful movie that brings an intimacy back to a family torn apart by false hopes and scattered communication. It shows the despair a child experiences when shadowed from the truth and the distance a father creates by telling tall tales hoping to make himself appear more than he seems. But it also shows the ties of a family never quite severed and so close to the core. With brilliant imaginative scenes Tim Burton has created an adult fairy tale for the ages that can appeal to children as well. This is Burton's most mature venture and he rises to the occasion managing to combine sentiment beside fantasy with great ability. At times touching this film also contains a touch of horror and moments of comical relief while maintaining integrity to the original book written by Daniel Wallace. Only Tim Burton could have managed to bring this book to life. For anyone who has experienced that bedside chat with a dying loved one or anyone who wished for those precious moments this movie will tug at your heart strings and leave you weeping.

His hard-headed and down-to-earth son would have none of it. Bloom's son drew a sharp line between fact and fable, and between him and his father.Most of the film is Edward's version, filled with prophecy, a modern-day Brigadoon, giants, circuses, and above all the untamed river spirit. The film also takes place during Edward's last days, with his son desperately trying to reconcile himself to the father's apparent inability to tell the truth.Bloom's wife is a wonderful character, and should have gotten a lot more attention. She was completely dedicated to Bloom, tolerated his tall tales and even loved him for them. Just by being there, she seems to catalyze the rapprochement between father and son. (That's not a spoiler - you saw it coming, right?)In the end, the son joins in Bloom's world beyond reality, while Bloom is still alive to welcome him there. The son also finds out that there was a lot more literal truth in Bloom's stories than he could ever have believed. Even more, at least one fantastical story was literally true and never told. Father and son are reunited, son's world is expanded beyond the mundane, and the hankies are passed. If there were such thing as a modern-day fairy tale, it would look like this.The gentle action and family feeling make this mostly a chick flick.

804864,A303AR58MOOYAV,B0001GOH6Q,"Woofboy ""Woofboy""","[0, 0]","I was sort of reluctant to see this movie when it first came out.  Lots of reviews that I had read said it was good for the first 15 minutes and then went in a downward spiral from there.  I also heard on the radio that the movie was three and a half hours long, and when a movie is that long, it's a big hunk of time that you need to take out of your day to watch the movie.  Finally, I went to see the movie and I am glad I did.I thought the opposite of what the reviews that I had read said.  The first 15 minutes of the movie seemed like a sappy chick-flick movie about a son remembering storys that his dieing father had told him as a little boy, and then the rest of the movie sped up into a supernatural story of a man's life-long adventure.  And the movie was a little over two hours, so I guess the radio lied.Now for a little plot summary, that may give out some of the stuff that happens in the movie, continue reading.  I'll try not to give too much away.  Big Fish was the story of a father and a son who didn't speak in years, speaking to each other for the first time in that time.  The son had always been told exagerations of the truth by his father (or so he thought), and got very annoyed at his Dad's fish stories.  This meeting between the father and son was because the father had become very ill, and was about to die. From that point on, through a series of flashbacks, you got to see the fathers life story his way, told my many different narrators.  Through the father's adventures, he befriended giants, joined the circus, fought in WWII in Japan and met up with a pair of Siamese Twins, found a perfect town, and then saved it, got married, caught a really big fish on the day his son was born and then let it go, and saw the way he would did in the glass eye of a witch.  Then the father had a stroke.  He was rushed to the hospital, and through much strain, asked his son to tell him the way that he would die, and then wispered the word river.  He had never told his son what he had seen in the witch's glass eye, so the son had to make up the story of his fathers death which had to do with the river.  After the son was done with the story, his fathers last words were ""Exactly!"" and died.  At the funeral, you got to see all of the people from the fathers stories, and as a suprising truth to the son that it wasn't all made up.The moral of the story:  Sometimes telling a exgerated lie based on the truth is much better than hearing the truth itself.  As the son found out, his father's version of how things happened was much more exciting and entertaining than the way they happened in reality.  And it also proved that dieing doesn't need to be a sad thing if you go out the right way.The movie had great special effects of the weird and supernatural too.  Having 12 foot tall giants standing next to 6 foot men was a nice feat, although at some points you could tell when puppets were being used.  The Siamese Twins were great and of course, the big fish in the movie was very realistic.  It was very Tim Burton-ish.For paying tribute to other movies.  Big Fish did that alot.  Many aspects of the movie reminded me of the movie Citizen Kane.  From all of the different charactors telling their version of the story to the father weezing out ""the river"" (aka- rosebud) on his death bed, I found it very alike.  I don't know if this one was purposeful, but the fathers wedding ring reminded me of the ring from Lord of the Rings.Everything was consistent in this movie for the most part.  There weren't any plot holes except for the Circus Ringmaster.

804867,AP3B615GM191G,B0001GOH6Q,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In my lifetime, I have come across very few movies (&#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;, &#34;The Champ&#34;) that will make grown men care enough about the stories/characters to weep.  &#34;Big Fish&#34; is one of those select films.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of a dying old man (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup).  For his entire life, the son has been overshadowed by the tall tales of his father, and is resentful of that fact.  In the final days of the old man's life, however, his stories featuring the younger version of himself (Ewan McGregor) prove to indeed be the most important link between father and son.Since this is a Tim Burton-directed movie, trying to explain it in words is like trying to describe a work of art hanging in a museum.  You know it is great, but you just can't quite put a solid explanation pulling together all the reasons why.  Suffice it to say, however, it is one of the rare Burton efforts that is rife with his flare for the cinematography craziness but yet manages to not get lost in the imagery and still make sense in the end.&#34;Big Fish&#34; is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch.  It will particular touch fathers and sons (as that is the backbone of the story), but there is something for everyone to enjoy.  Actors such as Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Marion Cotillard, and Steve Buscemi play key roles that enhance the emotion all that much more.Overall, &#34;Big Fish&#34; is a movie that must be seen in order to fully be understood.  Look at all the five-star reviews here on Amazon and know that it isn't because of a &#34;fad&#34; or a bunch of fanboys.  This is just a solid movie featuring top-notch storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor.",5,"A Man, His Son, And The Stories Between Them",1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,1799,"['lifetime', 'have', 'come', 'very', 'few', 'movies', '34', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '34', '34', 'Champ', '34', 'will', 'make', 'grown', 'men', 'care', 'enough', 'stories/characters', 'weep', '34', 'Big', 'Fish', '34', 'one', 'select', 'films.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'movie', 'story', 'dying', 'old', 'man', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'son', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'entire', 'life', 'son', 'been', 'overshadowed', 'tall', 'tales', 'father', 'resentful', 'fact', 'final', 'days', 'old', 'man', 'life', 'however', 'stories', 'featuring', 'younger', 'version', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'prove', 'indeed', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'link', 'father', 'son.Since', 'Tim', 'Burton-directed', 'movie', 'trying', 'explain', 'words', 'trying', 'describe', 'work', 'art', 'hanging', 'museum', 'know', 'great', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'put', 'solid', 'explanation', 'pulling', 'together', 'reasons', 'why', 'Suffice', 'say', 'however', 'one', 'rare', 'Burton', 'efforts', 'rife', 'flare', 'cinematography', 'craziness', 'yet', 'manages', 'not', 'get', 'lost', 'imagery', 'still', 'make', 'sense', 'end.', '34', 'Big', 'Fish', '34', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'emotional', 'movies', 'one', 'could', 'ever', 'watch', 'will', 'particular', 'touch', 'fathers', 'sons', 'backbone', 'story', 'something', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'Actors', 'such', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Marion', 'Cotillard', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'play', 'key', 'roles', 'enhance', 'emotion', 'much', 'more.Overall', '34', 'Big', 'Fish', '34', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'seen', 'order', 'fully', 'be', 'understood', 'Look', 'five-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'know', ""n't"", '34', 'fad', '34', 'bunch', 'fanboys', 'just', 'solid', 'movie', 'featuring', 'top-notch', 'storytelling', 'emotion', 'characters', 'cinematography', 'even', 'humor']",N/A
