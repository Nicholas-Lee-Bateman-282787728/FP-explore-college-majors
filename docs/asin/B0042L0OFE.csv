1383316,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B0042L0OFE,"Allen Smalling ""Eclectic Reader,""","[2, 3]","My sympathies go out to the makers of this ambitious but ultimately uneven and unsatisfying movie.  So many different ""types"" went into its making from the emergent and now established gay-male bear community in New York that too much of the flick seemed unfocused, not quite sure whether to be documentary or the more lighthearted comedy-drama it apparently was meant to be.The dominant plot concerns an unsatisfied young (and very smooth) ""twink,"" Tyler, who investigates the bear culture, very quickly abandons his platonic buddy to find bear roommates and, with the help of a job at a strategically-located coffee house, meets a whole new crew of men friends -- including Roger, a middle-aged so-called ""muscle-bear"" who flashbacks assure us lives a sex life worthy of a porno orgy.  Roger is a very good-looking guy (he reminds me of player/model Allen Silver) and in one of the film's numerous unsubtleties, we are not only informed he ""turns heads"" but immediately afterward proceed to a clip of him ambling down the street, turning the heads of other gay bears and bear ""chasers.""  Roger seems pleasant enough but a bit vague, and every time poor lovestruck Tyler comes on to him he gets c*ck-blocked in true rom-com fashion.  I won't reveal details or outcome but whatever message I could suss out of this plot stream is that a smooth novitiate and an experienced muscle daddy -- neither one of them with a hint of superfluous fat -- might have a chance.  Two problems: this has nothing to do with bears in the sense of men who are ""husky, hirsute and homosexual,"" and the actor who played Tyler turns in a subpar performance, with too many hesitant and monotonous lines delivered.The most problematic of the plot streams concerns a morbidly obese bear who needs a job, feels his career is impeded by the lack of a more acceptable middle-class physique, and seriously considers stomach-reduction (aka ""lap-band"") surgery.  Other than the need to conform, nothing he encounters in his research, including a glib, uninformative surgeon and a lover who clearly wants him just as he is, draws him closer to a decision to commit to the invasive procedure.  I find it interesting that some of the reviewers here (who, I would guess, have not battled against overweight) find it self-evident that he should go for the surgery, but to my way of thinking the way out of the dilemma is not so easy.  It's a pity that the actor playing the ""chub,"" who obviously knows how to play high comedy on the rare occasions the script gave him a witty line, was stuck with so much documentary, movie-of-the-week dialog to shovel.Probably the most successful of the plot streams deals with a middle-class gay couple, really much more our idea of representative bears -- no longer young, a little paunchy, but well mated -- who have been together four years and are getting a little bored sexually, and for whom one in particular the ""Seven-Year Itch"" has struck early.  They talk about opening up the marriage (affairs? three-ways? and how to screen applicants?) and the way they deal with this, both in the planning and disastrous execution, is zesty and fun, well-written and well-played.  I wish this whole movie had centered around them.  On the whole, I don't think BEAR CITY is totally to be disregarded, but it is not funny enough to be consistently entertaining and not informative enough to be enlightening, deficits which I imagine extend to gay and straight audiences alike.  See if it you like, and decide whether the good parts are outweighed by those of head-shaking irrelevance, or the other way around.",2,"Yogi, is this movie really for us?  --",1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,3605,"['sympathies', 'go', 'out', 'makers', 'ambitious', 'ultimately', 'uneven', 'unsatisfying', 'movie', 'So', 'many', 'different', 'types', 'went', 'making', 'emergent', 'now', 'established', 'gay-male', 'bear', 'community', 'New', 'York', 'too', 'much', 'flick', 'seemed', 'unfocused', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'be', 'documentary', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'comedy-drama', 'apparently', 'was', 'meant', 'be.The', 'dominant', 'plot', 'concerns', 'unsatisfied', 'young', 'very', 'smooth', 'twink', 'Tyler', 'who', 'bear', 'culture', 'very', 'quickly', 'abandons', 'platonic', 'buddy', 'find', 'bear', 'roommates', 'help', 'job', 'strategically-located', 'coffee', 'house', 'whole', 'new', 'crew', 'men', 'friends', 'including', 'Roger', 'middle-aged', 'so-called', 'muscle-bear', 'who', 'assure', 'sex', 'life', 'worthy', 'porno', 'orgy', 'Roger', 'very', 'good-looking', 'guy', 'player/model', 'Allen', 'Silver', 'one', 'film', 'numerous', 'unsubtleties', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'informed', 'heads', 'immediately', 'afterward', 'proceed', 'clip', 'ambling', 'down', 'street', 'turning', 'heads', 'other', 'gay', 'bears', 'bear', 'chasers', 'Roger', 'pleasant', 'enough', 'bit', 'vague', 'time', 'poor', 'lovestruck', 'Tyler', 'c*ck-blocked', 'true', 'rom-com', 'fashion', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'details', 'outcome', 'message', 'could', 'suss', 'plot', 'stream', 'smooth', 'novitiate', 'experienced', 'muscle', 'daddy', 'one', 'hint', 'superfluous', 'fat', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'Two', 'problems', 'nothing', 'do', 'bears', 'sense', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'husky', 'hirsute', 'homosexual', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Tyler', 'turns', 'subpar', 'performance', 'too', 'many', 'hesitant', 'monotonous', 'lines', 'most', 'problematic', 'plot', 'streams', 'morbidly', 'obese', 'bear', 'who', 'job', 'feels', 'career', 'impeded', 'lack', 'more', 'acceptable', 'middle-class', 'physique', 'seriously', 'considers', 'stomach-reduction', 'lap-band', 'surgery', 'Other', 'need', 'conform', 'nothing', 'research', 'including', 'glib', 'uninformative', 'surgeon', 'lover', 'who', 'clearly', 'just', 'closer', 'decision', 'commit', 'invasive', 'procedure', 'find', 'interesting', 'reviewers', 'here', 'who', 'would', 'guess', 'have', 'not', 'battled', 'overweight', 'find', 'self-evident', 'should', 'go', 'surgery', 'way', 'thinking', 'way', 'dilemma', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'pity', 'actor', 'playing', 'chub', 'who', 'obviously', 'how', 'play', 'high', 'comedy', 'rare', 'occasions', 'script', 'gave', 'witty', 'line', 'was', 'stuck', 'so', 'much', 'documentary', 'movie-of-the-week', 'dialog', 'shovel.Probably', 'most', 'successful', 'plot', 'streams', 'deals', 'middle-class', 'gay', 'couple', 'really', 'much', 'more', 'idea', 'representative', 'bears', 'longer', 'young', 'little', 'paunchy', 'well', 'mated', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'four', 'years', 'are', 'getting', 'little', 'bored', 'sexually', 'whom', 'one', 'particular', 'Seven-Year', 'Itch', 'struck', 'early', 'talk', 'opening', 'up', 'marriage', 'affairs', 'three-ways', 'how', 'screen', 'applicants', 'way', 'deal', 'planning', 'disastrous', 'execution', 'zesty', 'fun', 'well-written', 'well-played', 'wish', 'whole', 'movie', 'had', 'centered', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'BEAR', 'CITY', 'totally', 'be', 'disregarded', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'consistently', 'entertaining', 'not', 'informative', 'enough', 'be', 'enlightening', 'deficits', 'imagine', 'extend', 'gay', 'straight', 'audiences', 'alike', 'See', 'decide', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'outweighed', 'head-shaking', 'irrelevance', 'other', 'way']",BearCity

I've been a part of it for nearly 30 years and I am still not sure what it really is. Apparently neither were the producers of this movie and therein lies its charm. Bear City mercifully does not try to present a ""definitive"" view of bear life. The acting is superb, the ""extras"" and ""background"" guys are right on.  However,  it is a bit disjointed. It seems to dote on twinky queens almost as much as it does on bears, and that's why my review stopped at four stars. Character expansion could have occurred in the time allotted to the dress-up montage the two young guys mince through.

1383318,A3DVS9Y4Z1HIDJ,B0042L0OFE,"Bob Lind ""camelwest""","[24, 24]","To many of us, the subset of the ""Gaydom"" known as ""the Bear community"" is a bit of mystery.  While the stereotypically desirable gay man is usually thought of as young, shaved/smooth and slim/athletic, it's thought to be the exact opposite in the Bear community. But it is actually a very diverse, welcoming group, and that aspect is accurately and positively portrayed in ""Bear City"" (2010).The film focuses on Tyler (Joe Conti), a young NYC twink who is ashamed to admit to his roommate (a flaming but cute Alex DiDio) that he is only attracted to hairy bears ... to the point that he has a running fantasy of being ravished by Santa Claus!  He finally gets up the courage to go to a ""bear bar,"" where he meets some friendly, hairy men of all personalities, sizes and shapes, and decides to move into a room that one couple has to rent.  Tyler gets over his initial shyness and develops an unrequited crush on popular Roger (Gerald McCullouch, whom some may recognize from an ongoing role in ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigations"").The screenwriter also provides mini-dramas involving a couple who are agonizing over whether/how to open up their relationship, and a fat bear who is considering weight loss surgery (even though his partner opposes it.)  There is also an ongoing theme of Roger's innate fear of a committed relationship, and the goings-on at an annual gathering known as (you guessed it) ""Bear City.""Being somewhat familiar with that world, I felt the film presented a fairly realistic, positive look at the diversity, camaraderie and mutual support within the bear community, though I cringed a bit that it made casual ""back room"" sex seem to be an integral part of the view.  The basic story was a bit simplistic and predictable, although it was carried out admirably by its cast of mostly-new but talented actors, with a few surprise cameos I won't spoil by mentioning. Overall uplifting, very witty and enjoyable, this is a must for ""bears"" and anyone else curious about what it is all about.  Four hairy stars out of five.Plentiful DVD extras include commentary tracks, jnterview, ""making of"" documentary, photo gallery and music video.

It was refreshing to see a gay movie that wasn't populated by the usual Circuit crowd.  Most of these men looked like your average Joe, and I found that made the movie more real.  Next, there are some scenes in here that had me screaming with laughter.  The infamous ""shower scene"" was one.  I'm not going to give anything away, but I actually cried, I laughed so hard!  I could actually see something like this happening!  And the shopping for bear drag scene was also a hoot.  I enjoyed the music.  I enjoyed most of the actors, and I think the director did a good job of directing his movie.That being said, here's what brought my ratiing down from what would have been a very high 3-star, to the 2-star rating I gave it.  There is one sub-plot (and it rears its ugly head at the beginning of the film) that I couldn't handle.  One of the characters is EXTREMELY overweight.  He feels he cannot get hired at any job because of his weight, so he decides if he's going to make himself more employable, he needs to lose some weight.  He ponders the ""lap-band"" method.  Great Gertie's Nightgown, children, you would have thought he'd told his buddies he was thinking about giving heterosexuality a try.  His boyfriend leaves him.  NO ONE--not ONE of his friends--supports him.  I'm all for ""looks shouldn't matter; it's what's on the inside, not the outside that counts,"" but when you are headed for a very early grave because of your weight and you simply want to make a change so you can live a little longer, why on earth would you not have the support of your friends?  And this remains a major sub-plot throughout the movie.BearCity was fun and it was refreshing.

1383327,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0042L0OFE,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","That's a type of gay sexuality that fascinates many people and yet many others have never tried it. They don't know what they are missing. The point is that you cannot be a cub and a bear at the same time. You have to start as a cub and then you may eventually become a bear, but not sure since a cub is supposed to be moderately hairy and he is supposed to be young in shape and looks. No overweight, no flabby truck tires around the waist, etc. On the other side the bears are supposed to be very hairy, definitely older, though not old, and definitely fleshy and by fleshy I mean a lot of flesh, that may eventually be muscle but not pumped up inflated muscular balloons.So one cannot be a bear just because one wants. One can be a daddy any time after 35 but to be a bear is a little more than just age. To be a cub you have to be young for sure, though you can age as a cub for a while but the part is complex since you are a cub, hence you do not have the initiative, an yet bears, or daddies as for that, like being tickled, or teased by cubs. It is funny provided they remain calm and peaceful, respectful and playful, and in the end cuddle against the stomach of their bears.But the film is a lot more than just that. It shows very well what bear city is during a week end. Bare-chested men of all types, well, bears and cubs of course, a lot of playing around in some dark corners or rooms behind the scene, some if not a lot of alcohol. Music, disco or techno, who cares, just music to make you dance from one foot to the other and rest on your third leg, if you've brought it. But that is the fun of the week end. That's not real life.Real life is not much different from any other situation. You have couples that are closed though not secretive or exclusive if not reclusive. You can have two couples fooling around in the shower side by side, but a foursome is not the norm. In the same way a threesome is fancied by some but it is not the norm and it may end up sour if the third one is an accidental partner or simply someone picked from a bar for no reason whatsoever except to have some fun. If you are not careful then you may have some surprising reaction because this third one might be completely blocked on some kinky ideas, like pissing in the shower.The problem of obesity is real and the choice is simple: surgery if you can afford it, or a little help from your friends who can help you cut on the intake and reduce the fuel in the machine and the coal in the furnace. The choice is yours and your friends'.But then it is all a question of love and respect. Love is love and has no limit, so why not bears and cubs, though I prefer cubs to kids since kids are young goats more than anything else and hence are generally under age or just deliciously crunchy under your teeth. You're not supposed to eat your partner, even if he is a cub. I even think this kind of love, protective on one side and looking for protection on the other side, is quite attractive since the bear who could be a violent brute has to be protective and to take care of his cub with gentleness and finesse.Ah finesse in the world of sex!!!You, cubs and bears, will love that film, and you, all the others, men and women, will love discovering how full of love these men can be, even if they know stress and unemployment like anyone else. And mind you it is not pornographic except if you consider the kiss of a man to another man is pornography. Some do! Fine with them. They end up kissing trees along the road with their roaring cars. They try it once, twice at the most, because sooner or later that kind of kiss is fatal, lethal, deadly. I prefer the kiss of a bear or of a cub. I am not particular about details.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,I could not imagine how full of love a bear could be!,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,3740,"['type', 'gay', 'sexuality', 'many', 'people', 'yet', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'never', 'tried', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'are', 'missing', 'point', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'cub', 'bear', 'same', 'time', 'have', 'start', 'cub', 'then', 'may', 'eventually', 'become', 'bear', 'not', 'sure', 'cub', 'supposed', 'be', 'moderately', 'hairy', 'supposed', 'be', 'young', 'shape', 'overweight', 'flabby', 'truck', 'waist', 'etc', 'other', 'side', 'bears', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'hairy', 'definitely', 'older', 'not', 'old', 'definitely', 'fleshy', 'fleshy', 'mean', 'lot', 'flesh', 'may', 'eventually', 'be', 'muscle', 'not', 'pumped', 'up', 'inflated', 'muscular', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'bear', 'just', 'one', 'One', 'can', 'be', 'daddy', 'time', '35', 'be', 'bear', 'little', 'more', 'just', 'age', 'be', 'cub', 'have', 'be', 'young', 'sure', 'can', 'age', 'cub', 'while', 'part', 'complex', 'are', 'cub', 'hence', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'initiative', 'yet', 'bears', 'daddies', 'being', 'tickled', 'teased', 'cubs', 'funny', 'provided', 'remain', 'calm', 'peaceful', 'respectful', 'playful', 'end', 'cuddle', 'stomach', 'bears.But', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'bear', 'city', 'week', 'end', 'Bare-chested', 'men', 'types', 'well', 'bears', 'cubs', 'course', 'lot', 'playing', 'around', 'dark', 'corners', 'rooms', 'scene', 'not', 'lot', 'alcohol', 'Music', 'disco', 'techno', 'who', 'just', 'music', 'make', 'dance', 'one', 'foot', 'other', 'rest', 'third', 'leg', ""'ve"", 'brought', 'fun', 'week', 'end', 'not', 'real', 'life.Real', 'life', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'other', 'situation', 'have', 'couples', 'are', 'closed', 'not', 'secretive', 'exclusive', 'not', 'reclusive', 'can', 'have', 'two', 'couples', 'fooling', 'around', 'shower', 'side', 'side', 'foursome', 'not', 'norm', 'same', 'way', 'threesome', 'fancied', 'not', 'norm', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'sour', 'third', 'one', 'accidental', 'partner', 'simply', 'someone', 'picked', 'bar', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'have', 'fun', 'are', 'not', 'careful', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'surprising', 'reaction', 'third', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'completely', 'blocked', 'kinky', 'ideas', 'pissing', 'shower.The', 'problem', 'obesity', 'real', 'choice', 'simple', 'surgery', 'can', 'afford', 'little', 'help', 'friends', 'who', 'can', 'help', 'cut', 'intake', 'reduce', 'fuel', 'machine', 'coal', 'furnace', 'choice', 'yours', ""friends'.But"", 'then', 'question', 'love', 'respect', 'Love', 'love', 'limit', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'bears', 'cubs', 'prefer', 'cubs', 'kids', 'kids', 'are', 'young', 'goats', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'hence', 'are', 'generally', 'age', 'just', 'deliciously', 'crunchy', 'teeth', ""'re"", 'not', 'supposed', 'eat', 'partner', 'even', 'cub', 'even', 'think', 'kind', 'love', 'protective', 'one', 'side', 'looking', 'protection', 'other', 'side', 'quite', 'attractive', 'bear', 'who', 'could', 'be', 'violent', 'brute', 'be', 'protective', 'take', 'care', 'cub', 'gentleness', 'finesse.Ah', 'finesse', 'world', 'sex', 'cubs', 'bears', 'will', 'love', 'film', 'others', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'love', 'discovering', 'how', 'full', 'men', 'can', 'be', 'even', 'know', 'stress', 'unemployment', 'anyone', 'else', 'not', 'pornographic', 'consider', 'kiss', 'man', 'man', 'pornography', 'do', 'Fine', 'end', 'up', 'kissing', 'trees', 'road', 'roaring', 'cars', 'try', 'once', 'twice', 'most', 'sooner', 'later', 'kind', 'kiss', 'fatal', 'lethal', 'deadly', 'prefer', 'kiss', 'bear', 'cub', 'am', 'not', 'particular', 'details.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",BearCity

It is quite formulaic to the rom-com standards, however the characters were charming, funny and I enjoyed the setting. There was no real storyline, I found, other than trying to pair up a twink-ish guy with a muscle bear. I thought the main problem with the film was the presence of the muscle bear as the sex symbol and the object of desire. Bear communities do not like to be labelled and defined, however for a film about bears, I would have liked to have seen the main romance between a chubby bear and a chaser. The film does follow several relationships, of which the one I outlined was involved, however it was presented as a problematic relationship where fidelity was a key issue.The film was obviously restrained by a low budget, however it worked well with what it had. The actors were (for the main part) talented and worth watching. Comic timing was great, the dialogue I found nothing wrong with. I also enjoyed the rejection of stereotypical beauty throughout the film (though this was obviously countered by the muscle bear and the chaser getting together), especially in regards to the lapband surgery.I think this film does wonders for the bear community, and for the gay community in general. Rather than putting two gym junkies together who can't act and are really only there for the numerous sex scenes in GLBT films, this film focuses on character, on plot, on issues such as weight, desire, fidelity, trust.

And that fact raised my expectations even higher.""Bearcity"" isn't a ""killer"" :( But, it isn't dull either. The plot centres on a group of friends, their problems, their relationships. It also shows a part of the ""bear culture"" with its light and dark sides.The positive thing is the type of gay people presented here. They are not smooth dolls, with shaped ""6-pack"" anymore (well, with the exception for one camp who is bestfriend of Tyler).They are casual looking guys, some of them with a few extra kilos here and there (but still handsome!):)I cannot give more than 3 stars 'cause I didn't have this ""wow effect"" while watching it.Moreover, there are things that make this film more similar to a fairytale, than a real life story.It is hard to believe that Michael (the character with lot of overweight) hasn't got any health issues, and the only reason he wants to deal with extra kilos are problems to find a job.And Tyler seems to be kind of magician, who is able to change a notorious sex party follower (not so young anymore) into monogamous teddybear in a few days...As proverb says: you will not teach an old dog new tricks, won't you?Apart from these small missteps, ""Bearcity"" is a nice example of what gay theme movie can be.

It is a love story about `bears', and as I am a tad hirsute myself (I think I am a Cub) I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.This is about young, cute twenty something Tyler coming out of the closet `for the second time', by admitting he's into bears. Despite the fact that his flat mate can pull not one, but two Abercrombie and Fitch models and he is not interested! To any right thinking fan of Dorothy that is a sin.Well he gets down on the `scene' and is treated really well as a newbie and falls for bear lothario Roger (Gerald McCulloch of CSI apparently) but he seems to be interested in , well just about every other twink going, and most of them are, going; going for it actually. That said there is only mild sex scenes in this, not enough to upset the cat , but enough to have to be shown after the water shed, if real gay films actually ever do make it to the small screen in this land of ours.Any way he gets to meet Teddy Bears, Polar Bears, and even one worrying about his girth as he seems to be unemployable, yet his BF can't bear the idea of losing his daddy Bear.I must say I found this endearing, enchanting, in some parts educational and in some parts funny. But this is not the all out comedy that I saw in the TLA trailer, but that is usually the norm with trailers. The main part is you can see why this won three awards all from gay film festivals. I have many gay or gay themed films and so was very pleased that this strayed from the well worn path of cute hairless guys and did it with a fair amount of furry panache. One of the really hair ones did gross me out a bit, but he was funny so all is forgiven.
