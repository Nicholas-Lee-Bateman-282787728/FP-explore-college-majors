Everyone's complaining about the cinematography.  The problem is simple:  the thing was shot on a video camera, and evidently not a very good one. Presumably this series was meant for British television only.  In any event, it's hard to get past this, even well into the film.2.  Catherine Zeta-Jones has long had a reputation as an actress with a haughty and unpleasant personality, and I daresay you can get a whiff of that here.3.  The movie is only about an hour and 45 minutes, so while it follows the novel closely, it only follows the major lines.

191131,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,1574922807,Char,"[0, 0]","The countryside is the star of this movie!  Paris couldn't hold a candle to it.But a drawback of this awesome earthly place in the movie is that the people who live there seem to be awfully superstitious.  There's an exceedingly beautiful young woman among them they think to be a witch.  The enlightened viewer from the perspective of our enlightened modern age begins pretty soon to wonder if the ""superstitious"" people may be right.This is one of those stories in which the author has deliberately constructed a few significant character names.  ""Eustacia"" means, literally, ""high-standing""--and the movie maker has echoed that meaning by creating scenes in which Eustacia is depicted standing dramatically, like a classical goddess, on high places.  (And Clym, who loves to read, says that she belongs in the (classical name?) Room of the Biblioteque Nationale in Paris.)  Eustacia seems to rule over the men who worship her.  In certain conversations, she evinces a high and haughty behavior.  And, like a ""witch,"" she uses her great personal drawing power for selfish ends.Damon Wildeve's name can be translated perhaps as ""Daemon of a Wild Eve-ning""...Another significant name is that of ""Yeobright,"" which is synonymous with the word ""eyebright.""  Clym Yeobright sees Eustacia first--and last--in a vision.  He apparently has the gift of ""second sight,"" but his name which focuses on concepts relating to sight and insight is somewhat ironic.  He is blind to the seeming--or is it real?--duplicity of Eustacia's character.  His mother, Mrs. Yeobright, has great insight and wisdom about the love relationships between men and women.Diggory Venn, who is capable of sacrificial love, seems to be a kind of Christ figure, especially in the way he is visually depicted by the movie director at the end of the story.  The red, the ""reddle,"" that covers him because of his work with sheep dye is washed off and, in the process, his face is reminiscent of the ""Ecce Homo,"" the bloody-face of Christ during the Crucifixion, and this occurs during a scene where he risks his life for the sake, indirectly, of his beloved's happiness.  This is also the point when his time of sacrifice will be over.  I don't see that the spelling of his name holds any hidden meaning, but possibly a linguist could discover that it does.(After reading a summary of the book, I've learned that Diggory's red coloring is meant to suggest a DEMONIC figure.  He is referred to in the book as mephistophelean.  So, there's a laugh on me.  Don't pay any attention to my fanciful interpretation of the film's symbolism! --It's been a long time since I read the book and I never studied it in literature classes.)Thomas Hardy was NOT an orthodox professing Christian, yet, at the end of the movie-story, Clym is shown teaching on a hillside in a scene that may very well remind the viewer of Christ doing the same.  Clym, the seer of Beauty in this scene, states that he does not speak as the representative of a specific creed but, rather, in behalf of a doctrine that is for the enlightenment of all good people.  This defining moment probably represents the mind and heart of Hardy.At a symbolic level of interpretation--for people who like to speculate about such things that authors do sometimes write into their literature--Eustacia OF THE FILM could be seen (because of the teaching scene on the hillside), to stand for a ""Muse,"" or, more likely, for just ""Beauty.""  (Clym calls her ""MY Beauty.""  I may be stretching things to suggest such an interpretation.  Am just not familiar enough with the novel to say for sure.)This is a visually GORGEOUS movie. It's the best Hallmark Hall of Fame film I've ever seen.  Because of the visual beauty of it, I think it's a great work of film ART.I especially appreciated the character created by the woman who played Mother Yeobright; I think the actress's name is Joan Plowright.I hope this review won't create preconceptions that spoil anybody's viewing this film with a fresh eye.

191134,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,1574922807,Hikari,"[66, 69]","This early vehicle for a young Catherine Zeta-Jones does justice to the complex Hardy novel despite the constraints of the television movie format.  'La Zeta' is perfectly cast as Eustacia Vye, a mysterious beauty with 'black hair and pagan eyes' who captivates the young men of the vicinity while the older country people regard her with suspicion as a witch who is not to be trusted.  Eustacia has a reputation as a loose woman in the neighborhood--she dallies with another woman's fiance out of sheer boredom, even though she is tired of him.  When dashing Clym Yeobright returns home after many years abroad in Paris, Eustacia sets her cap for him, with tragic results.Fans who have followed Zeta-Jones' high-profile career in movies such as 'Entrapment', 'Traffic' &amp; 'Chicago' will be interested to see her here, long before Michael Douglas and Oscar came calling, in her debut role outside of her native UK.  She displays all the beauty and cool self-possession of the star she would later become.  She's had her teeth capped since, and been otherwise glammed up, Hollywood-style, but all the fundamentals are there.  The setting is breathtaking (shot on location in Northern England), and the simple yet vivid costumes Eustacia wears add to her characterization.  Eustacia/Catherine is dressed simply but vividly in tones of scarlet, yellow and turquoise blue, setting her in sharp relief to the browns and grays of the landscape, and the dull clothes worn by the other characters.The entire cast does a superb job, but this is really Zeta-Jones' show.

191135,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,1574922807,Howard M. Kindel,"[2, 2]","The first time I saw this film, I was very disappointed.  It was the first rendition of a Thomas Hardy novel I had seen; and I expected a great deal more than the film delivered.  ""The Return of the Native"" is my favorite Hardy novel, though Clym Yeobright, the main character, is not my favorite Hardy character.  In fact, very few of Hardy's characters - especially his male characters - are truly admirable.  But then, Hardy is more an anti-Victorian author in that he is attempting to depict real people, not larger-than-life cardboard heroes and heroines.  It goes without saying, of course, than Clym's eventual blindness simply mirrors his blindness to those around him - his ""tragic flaw.""  Even so, I found Ray Stevenson's portrayal of Clym convincing in that Stevenson seemed to personify Clym's obtuseness.  I did not, however, care for Catherine Zeta-Jones' Eustacia Vye.  It wasn't her performance, which was nuanced and accurately captured Eustacia's character.  Somehow, she just didn't look the part - though I have to say, it was Eustacia as I envisioned her reading the novel, not necessarily Eustacia as Hardy intended her to look; and certainly not Eustacia as others might visualize her.  It's just that Eustacia is such a powerful presence in the novel that it's difficult to imagine someone as innocently beautiful as Catherine Zeta-Jones evoking so much emotional reaction in others. There was an Audrey Hepburn kind of almost childlike innocence about her when there ought to have been more of a Merle Oberon (a la ""Wuthering Heights"") coldness.  I can't picture anyone not liking Catherine Zeta-Jones' Eustacia Vye.At any rate, though I still found Catherine Zeta-Jones too innocent-looking for Eustacia Vye, when I watched the film a second time, I loved it.  The reason is simply that I had no expectations of liking it, so there was no possibility of disappointment.  Consequently, everything beautiful about the film came through clearly this time; and everything that might be ""wrong"" about the film completely vanished.

Clym, however, wants to live out his days as a humble schoolmaster on the heath with his beloved Eustacia.It's no wonder Thomas Hardy's novel is a classic and this TV-movie does it justice.  The acting is uniformly excellent, the location is, in turns, bleak and wonderful, the sorrowful mood is enhanced by a plaintiff folk score, and the literate script stays close to the book.  The hypnotically beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones captures Eustacia's willfulness and pride and is perfect in the role.  Clive Owen plays Damon Wildeve, a local man who lusts after the elusive Eustacia.  He's very good, as is Ray Stevenson, the 'native' blinded by Eustacia's charms.  Together, they form a powerful and tragic love triangle.

The main reason this Return of the Native is so good is because the filmmakers do not overtly present Eustacia as a black witch. Yes, she has dark hair and eyes, but her manner is usually that of an ordinary woman. I love subtlety in a film, and there is too little of that nowadays. Even if they make Eustacia more obviously responsible for her mother-in-law's death (instead of making her bitten by a snake on a hot summer day, they just have her witch of a daughter-in-law stare at her through the window), she never wears black and has a rather nice voice. This film, for a good while, leaves open the possibility that Eustacia is an ordinary person.Also contributing to the film's success is the fact that any changes, additions, and omissions are not only minor, they are explained. It doesn't really matter if Susan burns an effigy doll of Eustacia while saying the Lord's prayer backwards (as in the book), or if she burns the latter's handkerchief (as in the film). The point is that something representing Eustacia gets burned. The eliminated gambling scene was here made unnecessary, and the image of Eustacia's probably purified ghost in the last scene makes for a nicer ending.This is definitely one of the most successful translations of Thomas Hardy to the screen.",4,The Human Witch,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,1377,"['one', 'two', 'most', 'faithful', 'four', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'adaptations', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'main', 'reason', 'Return', 'Native', 'so', 'good', 'filmmakers', 'do', 'not', 'overtly', 'present', 'Eustacia', 'black', 'witch', 'Yes', 'dark', 'hair', 'eyes', 'manner', 'usually', 'ordinary', 'woman', 'love', 'subtlety', 'film', 'too', 'little', 'nowadays', 'Even', 'make', 'Eustacia', 'more', 'obviously', 'responsible', 'mother-in-law', 'death', 'instead', 'making', 'bitten', 'snake', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'just', 'have', 'witch', 'daughter-in-law', 'stare', 'window', 'never', 'black', 'rather', 'nice', 'voice', 'film', 'good', 'while', 'open', 'possibility', 'Eustacia', 'ordinary', 'person.Also', 'contributing', 'film', 'success', 'fact', 'changes', 'additions', 'omissions', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'minor', 'are', 'explained', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Susan', 'effigy', 'doll', 'Eustacia', 'saying', 'Lord', 'prayer', 'backwards', 'book', 'latter', 'handkerchief', 'film', 'point', 'something', 'representing', 'Eustacia', 'burned', 'eliminated', 'gambling', 'scene', 'was', 'here', 'made', 'unnecessary', 'image', 'Eustacia', 'probably', 'purified', 'ghost', 'last', 'scene', 'nicer', 'ending.This', 'definitely', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'translations', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'screen']",Return of the Native VHS

191145,A2UUYORVIZ00UH,1574922807,Noirdame,"[3, 3]","I caught the first half hour of this when it originally aired on CBS in 1994, but as I was a teenager I did not know of Thomas Hardy's work, nor did I recognize Catherine Zeta-Jones or Clive Owen as they were both unknown in North America at the time. I have since taken a liking to watching period films and reading the classic novels upon which they are based. I have read the novel of The Return of the Native several times; it is one of my favorite Hardy novels, but I couldn't help but notice some similarities to Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, similarities that are evident in the film as well. Wind-swept moors, a headstrong, misguided heroine who marries a kind-hearted but dull gentleman for opportunity and possibility of society acceptance yet she maintains her strong connection to the brooding, roguish man who is tormented by the spell she casts. Spell, of course, used as a figure of speech, although raven-haired Eustacia Vye (Zeta-Jones) is suspected to be a witch  and shunned by the locals of Egdon Heath, since her effect on men seems to have some kind of bewitching quality in their eyes. Even though Damon Wildeve (Owen) is pledged to marry the fair Thomasin Yeobright (Claire Skinner), he cannot seem to shake his feelings for Eustacia, who keeps drawing him to her with her bonfires and her indecision to leave England with him. As much as she wants to escape from Egdon, she feels that somehow Wildeve is beneath her, so when Thomasin's cousin Clym (Ray Stevenson) returns from Paris, she immediately sets her sights on him and leaves Damon in the dust. He, in turn, marries Thomasin almost out of spite, hoping to hurt Eustacia, but she only pushes forward with her plan to win Clym's heart, wed him and hoping that he will take her away from the heath she despises so much. However, with Hardy, things rarely the work out the way his characters hope - Clym wants to stay in Wessex, to open a school and live simply, which only brings his wife to despair and boredom. She begins to wonder if she made a mistake, and re-encountering her former lover only cements her confusion. She is somewhat torn, and this ultimately brings on her downfall as well as Damon's. Other notable portrayals are Steven MackIntosh as reddleman Diggory Venn, who unselfishly loves Thomasin and will do anything to see her happy; his character is both honorable and down-to-earth yet possesses a kind of unworldly knowledge about what he sees around him. And the ever reliable Joan Plowright as Clym's mother turns in yet another wonderful performance. Of course, there are liberties taken (cause of death of Mrs. Yeobright is altered, omission of Damon and Thomasin's child, inclusion of more of the novel's text would have been good at the climax), but overall, for the running time, Hallmark did a commendable job with this presentation. The characters of Eustacia, Wildeve, Diggory and even Thomasin have always held more interest for me than Clym, who in my opinion was never a very compelling character to begin with, sort of like Edgar Linton. Stevenson, also a virtual unknown at the time, does well with his pretty much thankless role - I never really understood what Eustacia saw in him other than her plans for escape and maybe his idealism, but Damon was a far better match for her. With Clym, she sees what she wants to see, whereas with Damon the reality is something that she doesn't know if she wants to see (there has to be some symbolism of Clym losing his sight). Of course, Eustacia and Damon are the most tragic, and are doomed, not only because they are both outsiders and their relationship to each other (which would be considered scandalous in Victorian England), but their desire to escape is only achieved in death. One of the complaints I have about this production is how there was none of the novel's dialogue when Eustacia takes her fatal plunge and Wildeve's ill-fated attempt to rescue her included.Filmed in Exmoor National Park (rather than in Dorset), the location does make the setting seem more rugged and wild, the music is very emotional and romantic, the cinematography very lush and pretty, Zeta-Jones is costumed more colorfully than the other women, no doubt to make to make her more distinctive (but her beauty does that alone). Very good supporting cast also. And I have to say, I cannot picture anyone else but Catherine and Clive in the roles, even when I read the novel.

191146,A3FBZDOS0SKVIJ,1574922807,Paulina S,"[2, 2]","I stumbled on this DVD at my local library and was hooked from the first.  This is a lush and intelligent adapation of Hardy's classic, with wonderful actors, absolutely stunning scenery, and a fabulous, haunting score by Carl Davis.The protagonist, Eustacia Vye, is rather Scarlett O'Hara-esque: willful, restless, and reckless, she uses her looks and charm to manipulate those around her.  Catherine Zeta-Jones brings necessary vulnerability, as well as passion, to the role, and she has both the cool confidence and smoldering beauty to make it inevitable that every man she meets is bewitched by her.Several of Britain's finest &#34;tried and trues&#34; make up the supporting cast: Joan Plowright as a loving and leery mother, Claire Skinner as her tenderhearted niece, and Steven Mackintosh--in a radical departure from his uber-evil character &#34;The Street&#34; from &#34;Prime Suspect&#34;--is the wise and long-suffering Diggory Venn. Celia Imrie appears as a superstitious neighbor, and a bearded Cive Owen oozes heat and a hungry tigerishness as Damon Wildeve, Eustacia's frustrated suitor.Ray Stevenson doesn't fare as well in the role of Clym Yeobright, the idealistic hero who comes back to his native village.  Stevenson has become an extraordinary actor, but he is rather meh here.  He's by no means awful, but is a bit one-dimensional and colorless compared to the other vivid characters.  It doesn't help that he's saddled with the only weak dialogue in the film.  I'm not sure there's anyone who could convincingly say some of his lines.Overall, though, this is a first-rate and rewarding production. Unusual for TV historical dramas of its time, it offers an authentic look at rural life in the mid-1800's--I loved the details of the farmers painting the sheep with reddle, and the accurate costuming, and all the folk songs sung at various events.
