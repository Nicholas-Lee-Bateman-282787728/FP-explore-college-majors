710122,A1Z6U4CA4SNMTI,B00006AUH7,"Andrae Garavito ""Tyke""","[6, 10]","The Learning Channel has released a fine video of hard-hitting evidence explaining once & for all how the two tallest buildings in the history of Manhatten were reduced to rubble during the attacks of 9/11/01. You'll also see some pretty neat camera angles of the second plane hitting the South Tower, some that I haven't seen before. A brief history of the rise of the twin towers is presented here, as well as footage showing the aftermath of the 1993 WTC bombing. The reason why I don't give this DVD/video 5 stars is because it was only 53 minutes long. They should've added a lot more to this video before releasing it on VHS/DVD. Oh, well, I still recommend this film. It will give you a clear understanding as to why the WTC collapsed.",4,Anatomy of a Collapse,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,742,"['Learning', 'Channel', 'released', 'fine', 'video', 'hard-hitting', 'evidence', 'explaining', 'once', 'how', 'two', 'tallest', 'buildings', 'history', 'Manhatten', 'were', 'reduced', 'rubble', 'attacks', '9/11/01', ""'ll"", 'also', 'see', 'pretty', 'neat', 'camera', 'angles', 'second', 'plane', 'hitting', 'South', 'Tower', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'brief', 'history', 'rise', 'twin', 'towers', 'presented', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'footage', 'showing', 'aftermath', '1993', 'WTC', 'bombing', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'DVD/video', '5', 'stars', 'was', 'only', '53', 'minutes', 'long', 'should', ""'ve"", 'added', 'lot', 'more', 'video', 'releasing', 'VHS/DVD', 'Oh', 'well', 'still', 'recommend', 'film', 'will', 'give', 'clear', 'understanding', 'why', 'WTC', 'collapsed']",World Trade Center - Anatomy of the Collapse
710123,AWPODHOB4GFWL,B00006AUH7,"Martin A Hogan ""Marty From SF""","[12, 17]","For some reason this documentary seems to put that entire horrible day into perspective. To know exactly how those planes entered the towers, how they hit, why the fire was so intense, why people jumped, why the towers collapsed, seem to satify that angry, sad itch people have to just want to know &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;. It is also touching at points, especially when irony is obvious when an engineer states that &quot;even a 727 could not knock over the building&quot;. It's heavy stuff, but seems to answer some questions that are nagging at so many Americans.",5,See And Hear It All Explained,1042070400,"01 9, 2003",2003,578,"['reason', 'documentary', 'put', 'entire', 'horrible', 'day', 'perspective', 'know', 'exactly', 'how', 'planes', 'entered', 'towers', 'how', 'hit', 'why', 'fire', 'was', 'so', 'intense', 'why', 'people', 'jumped', 'why', 'towers', 'collapsed', 'seem', 'satify', 'angry', 'sad', 'itch', 'people', 'have', 'just', 'want', 'know', 'quot', 'how', 'quot', 'quot', 'why', 'quot', 'also', 'touching', 'points', 'especially', 'when', 'irony', 'obvious', 'when', 'engineer', 'states', 'quot', 'even', '727', 'could', 'not', 'knock', 'building', 'quot', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'answer', 'questions', 'are', 'nagging', 'so', 'many', 'Americans']",World Trade Center - Anatomy of the Collapse

As of this writing I still have not watched it again.  It's very strange how everything falls into place to make you realize that the Twin Towers NEVER had a chance.  Watch it for yourself and you will awaken into a whole new world of reality.  Unfortuneately....it's an EVIL world!

710125,A2WSI8HOWHFDOT,B00006AUH7,Rocco Dormarunno,"[18, 28]","Although I was but a few miles away from the WTC on that awful day, I was spared watching it unfold. Like many New Yorkers, it took me a couple of years to even begin to look at the videos surrounding the disaster. The first thing I watched was Ken Burns' final episode to his NEW YORK documentary. Because I had seen the previous seven parts, and had loved them, I knew this subject would be in good hands, and it was.This documentary, ANATOMY OF A COLLAPSE, was the next I watched. It, too, struck be as well-conceived and intelligently explained. The CGI work supporting the expert analysis was an enormous aide to understanding the chain reaction that led to the implosions. Still, this is an unbearably sad documentary that seemed a little too coldly analytical, almost distant: something the Burns' documentary avoided. But I think everyone will have a different emotional response to anything about the WTC disaster. For this reason, I hope people will watch this video to gain a solid understanding of the whys and hows those beautiful silver towers crumbled.",4,Painfully logical,1077494400,"02 23, 2004",2004,1067,"['was', 'few', 'miles', 'away', 'WTC', 'awful', 'day', 'was', 'spared', 'watching', 'unfold', 'many', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'took', 'couple', 'years', 'even', 'begin', 'look', 'videos', 'surrounding', 'disaster', 'first', 'thing', 'watched', 'was', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'final', 'episode', 'NEW', 'YORK', 'documentary', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'seven', 'parts', 'had', 'loved', 'knew', 'subject', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'hands', 'was.This', 'documentary', 'ANATOMY', 'A', 'COLLAPSE', 'was', 'next', 'watched', 'too', 'struck', 'be', 'well-conceived', 'intelligently', 'explained', 'CGI', 'work', 'supporting', 'expert', 'analysis', 'was', 'enormous', 'aide', 'understanding', 'chain', 'reaction', 'led', 'implosions', 'Still', 'unbearably', 'sad', 'documentary', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'coldly', 'analytical', 'almost', 'distant', 'something', 'Burns', 'documentary', 'avoided', 'think', 'everyone', 'will', 'have', 'different', 'emotional', 'response', 'anything', 'WTC', 'disaster', 'reason', 'hope', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'video', 'gain', 'solid', 'understanding', 'whys', 'hows', 'beautiful', 'silver', 'towers', 'crumbled']",World Trade Center - Anatomy of the Collapse
710126,A3OI841P5R6FCH,B00006AUH7,Zagnorch,"[25, 31]","Being a regular viewer of TV disaster documentaries, I checked this show out when it premiered on The Learning Channel several months after the horrific events it depicts and discusses. It goes into the history of Manhattan's World Trade Center from its initial conception to its construction through to the first WTC  attack on in 1993 to the infamous attack that finally brought the massive towers down on that fateful September morning. Also shown in computer-animated demos are the innovative construction techniques (e.g. ""tubes"" and ""trusses"") that made the creation of such a huge building possible, and also unfortunately led to its eventual demise.Some might argue that this documentary takes a too-clinical and unemotional look at the disaster. Personally, I found this to not be the case: in the many interviews of the key people behind the building's conception and creation, it is apparent that all of them are still shaken by the loss of the structure they'd spent so many years and untold millions of dollars to build and maintain. And the scenes featuring federal agents processing the WTC rubble at New Jersey's `Fresh Kills' landfill is sure to grab your gut as well.`Late",4,An Inside Look at the Effects of a Horrific Act,1036368000,"11 4, 2002",2002,1190,"['Being', 'regular', 'viewer', 'TV', 'disaster', 'documentaries', 'checked', 'show', 'out', 'when', 'premiered', 'Learning', 'Channel', 'several', 'months', 'horrific', 'events', 'history', 'Manhattan', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'initial', 'conception', 'construction', 'first', 'WTC', 'attack', '1993', 'infamous', 'attack', 'finally', 'brought', 'massive', 'towers', 'down', 'fateful', 'September', 'morning', 'Also', 'shown', 'computer-animated', 'demos', 'are', 'innovative', 'construction', 'techniques', 'e.g', 'tubes', 'trusses', 'made', 'creation', 'such', 'huge', 'building', 'possible', 'also', 'unfortunately', 'led', 'eventual', 'demise.Some', 'might', 'argue', 'documentary', 'too-clinical', 'unemotional', 'look', 'disaster', 'Personally', 'found', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'many', 'interviews', 'key', 'people', 'building', 'conception', 'creation', 'apparent', 'are', 'still', 'shaken', 'loss', 'structure', ""'d"", 'spent', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'untold', 'millions', 'dollars', 'build', 'maintain', 'scenes', 'featuring', 'federal', 'agents', 'processing', 'WTC', 'rubble', 'New', 'Jersey', 'Fresh', 'Kills', 'landfill', 'sure', 'grab', 'gut', 'well.', 'Late']",World Trade Center - Anatomy of the Collapse
