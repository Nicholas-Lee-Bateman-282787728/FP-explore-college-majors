196653,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6300147258,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Darling, 1965 filmThe story begins with the life of a young girl. At 20 Diana Scott is interviewed by a reporter and discovered. They look at abandoned houses near the water, then talk. Her husband studies Italian. A reporter interviews an old author, then becomes friendly with Diana. ""Have you done this before?"" Later this reporter interviews people for their opinions about current life. There is a meeting to raise money for a charity. There is gambling in this big mansion. Diana wins a pile of money at roulette. [Was there a brake?] Will Diana be selected as an actress in a murder mystery? Her boyfriend Miles gets a surprise. Diana visits a doctor. ""How'd you feel?"" ""Poor little thing."" We see a little boy play with a toy pistol. There is a dinner party. Diana is good with children. A married couple talk in bed. Diana returns to London. She attends an audition, then leaves to meet her boyfriend.Diana's car is towed for overtime parking. They visit Paris and meet sophisticated friends (tr&eacute;s riche). [Does wealth cause corruption?] We see the circles where Diana circulates. They smoke, laugh, and undress. Their conversation reveals their characters. There is personal conflict between Diana and Miles. [No surprise?] Diana, wearing a towel, poses for photographs. Will she be discovered as a model? Who is ""The Happiness Girl""? She goes shopping and takes a discount. A letter brings news from her husband. Diana does the usual ""beauty queen"" work pushing products like chocolate. She meets a descendant of a Pope, and makes new friends. She goes to a church. [Note the benches.] Her boyfriend goes out at night (to reveal his character). A boat docks on the river, an aristocrat desires her. Diana also goes out at night. She makes a decision.Diana is now back in London. There is another party in an apartment. Couples pair off. Things don't go well. Miles disappoints her, but stays. ""Its late."" ""Life is full of `if only'."" She attends a funeral. She talks to a newspaper reporter (and shows her skill in conversation). She finds religion and a new husband. A new princess. Charity work to help the less fortunate. [Irony?] ""Are you all right, my Darling?"" [Is her new life more empty now?] She drives alone, her husband is unavailable at night. Her loneliness affects her. She returns to Britain and meets Robert. Is it too late? ""This is just for old times sake."" Who is using who? Robert drives Diana to the airport. Is she as happy as anyone can be?This movie was different from the others of that era. It revealed the emptiness (and phoniness) of people who worked in the advertising racket. Advertising is used to deceive the unwary public and create ""peer pressure"" from the messages it delivers. Avoiding advertising is always good, but ""product placement"" also carries a message. [Some of Erle Stanley Gardner's novels warned against the beauty contest racket of that era where young girls would be lured into advertising.]",3,The Happiness Girl,1331596800,"03 13, 2012",2012,2960,"['Darling', '1965', 'filmThe', 'story', 'life', 'young', 'girl', '20', 'Diana', 'Scott', 'interviewed', 'reporter', 'discovered', 'look', 'abandoned', 'houses', 'water', 'then', 'talk', 'husband', 'studies', 'Italian', 'A', 'reporter', 'interviews', 'old', 'author', 'then', 'friendly', 'Diana', 'Have', 'done', 'Later', 'reporter', 'people', 'opinions', 'current', 'life', 'meeting', 'raise', 'money', 'charity', 'gambling', 'big', 'mansion', 'Diana', 'pile', 'money', 'roulette', '[', 'Was', 'there', 'brake', ']', 'Will', 'Diana', 'be', 'selected', 'actress', 'murder', 'mystery', 'boyfriend', 'Miles', 'surprise', 'Diana', 'doctor', 'How', ""'d"", 'feel', 'Poor', 'little', 'thing', 'see', 'little', 'boy', 'play', 'toy', 'pistol', 'dinner', 'party', 'Diana', 'good', 'children', 'married', 'couple', 'talk', 'bed', 'Diana', 'London', 'audition', 'then', 'meet', 'boyfriend.Diana', 'car', 'towed', 'overtime', 'parking', 'visit', 'Paris', 'meet', 'sophisticated', 'friends', 'tr', 'eacute', 'riche', '[', 'Does', 'wealth', 'cause', 'corruption', ']', 'see', 'circles', 'where', 'Diana', 'smoke', 'laugh', 'undress', 'conversation', 'reveals', 'characters', 'personal', 'conflict', 'Diana', 'Miles', '[', 'surprise', ']', 'Diana', 'wearing', 'towel', 'poses', 'photographs', 'Will', 'be', 'discovered', 'model', 'Who', 'Happiness', 'Girl', 'shopping', 'discount', 'letter', 'news', 'husband', 'Diana', 'usual', 'beauty', 'queen', 'work', 'pushing', 'products', 'chocolate', 'descendant', 'Pope', 'new', 'friends', 'church', '[', 'Note', 'benches', ']', 'boyfriend', 'out', 'night', 'reveal', 'character', 'boat', 'river', 'aristocrat', 'Diana', 'also', 'out', 'night', 'decision.Diana', 'now', 'back', 'London', 'party', 'apartment', 'Couples', 'pair', 'off', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'well', 'Miles', 'late', 'Life', 'full', 'only', 'funeral', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'skill', 'conversation', 'religion', 'new', 'husband', 'new', 'princess', 'Charity', 'work', 'help', 'less', 'fortunate', '[', 'Irony', 'Are', 'all', 'right', 'Darling', '[', 'new', 'life', 'more', 'empty', 'now', ']', 'alone', 'husband', 'unavailable', 'night', 'loneliness', 'Britain', 'meets', 'Robert', 'too', 'late', 'just', 'old', 'times', 'sake', 'Who', 'using', 'who', 'Robert', 'Diana', 'airport', 'as', 'happy', 'anyone', 'can', 'be', 'movie', 'was', 'different', 'others', 'era', 'revealed', 'emptiness', 'phoniness', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'advertising', 'racket', 'Advertising', 'used', 'deceive', 'unwary', 'public', 'create', 'peer', 'pressure', 'messages', 'Avoiding', 'advertising', 'always', 'good', 'product', 'placement', 'also', 'message', 'Erle', 'Stanley', 'Gardner', 'novels', 'warned', 'beauty', 'contest', 'racket', 'era', 'where', 'young', 'girls', 'would', 'be', 'lured', 'advertising', ']']",N/A

196658,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300147258,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","The swinging 60's gets a moral awakening in John Schlesinger's 1965 gem `Darling'.  With rich character development and a stunningly provocative demeanor, `Darling' barrels through to the very end with such charisma (of the shockingly endearing kind) that one cannot help but become completely engulfed in its prose.Julie Christie (in her Oscar winning role) plays young and determined model Diana Scott who falls in and out of one failed relationship after another in her struggle to `make it'.  She leaves her young and immature husband for an older gentleman, Robert (who happens to be married himself), but life lessons leave her feeling overwhelmed to the point where she falls into an affair with a suave film director named Miles.  When that relationship seems trying she swears off men and holes up with her friend Malcolm (who happens to prefer the company of men himself) where she meets the wealthy Italian Prince Cesare della Romita and contemplates becoming a Princess.The film reminded me somewhat of Fellini's masterpiece `La Dolce Vita', especially the French party scene, which seemed an obvious influence, but this film is far from a copy cat.  It delves into similar themes (such as the demoralization of high society) but it does so with a unique vision all its own.They are definite companion pieces, and I recommend watching them both as a pair.What I admire so much about `Darling' is that it is truly a fearless film.  While still tame according to today's standards (if you can call them that) it is really intriguing to see all that they present in this film without any hesitation.  The performances are truly lived in and completely felt by the audience, and the script is stunningly deep despite never truly going anywhere out of the norm.  What I mean by that is that there isn't a whole lot that happens in `Darling' outside of Diana's relationships, but the way in which each relationship is explored and developed takes us to a place deep within Diana herself.  The film also beautifully contrasts Diana's outward and inward personas, giving us a woman who is perceived by many to be happy (one of her campaigns is the `happy girl') but who is traumatically unhappy with her lot in life.This all comes to a head at the films rapturous conclusion when Diana (literally) strips herself of everything and shatters before us.  Everything she has worked so hard to secure has proven itself to be the (figurative) death of her.So, let's talk about the acting (always a favorite subject of mine).  There have been many words spoken about Christie winning the Oscar over Julie Andrews (I even read an absurd comment on IMDB by someone who hasn't even SEEN this movie yet claims that the Academy must be blind because there is no way that Christie could possibly be better than Andrews).  I'll say this; neither actress should have won that year since the best performance by an actress in a leading role was Anna Karina, who was flawlessly engaging in `Pierrot le Fou'.  That said, both Andrews and Christie were wonderful, but I wholly back up Christie's win.  She tapped into something so sincere and so raw.  The way that Christie balances her characters emotional conflicts is just flawlessly done.  That final scene with Bogarde is just mesmerizing painful.  Much has been said about Bogarde and Harvey.  I don't know what else to say.  They were both phenomenal, and Bogarde may even win my personal Best Actor award that year (that stunning sidewalk confrontation with Christie alone is worthy of an award), but I feel compelled to ignore them altogether and focus on someone who doesn't get mentioned too often.Roland Curram.Roland plays Malcolm, Diana's flirtatiously dominate friend.  He has but a few scenes, but they are ridiculously layered and very memorable.  Every facial expression he throws her way allows us to scrutinize her as honestly as a friend without judging her, as he so obviously does not.  He threw himself into the role with an effortless charisma that drew me to him.In the end, I just have to say that `Darling' is a sublime film.  It is ultimately a stirring and somewhat depressing look at the emptiness of aspirations, but it is remarkably handled on all fronts, and its blatant honesty and fearless embracing of the culturally taboo make this film an absolute treasure.",5,A life less ordinary...,1265673600,"02 9, 2010",2010,4331,"['swinging', '60', 'moral', 'awakening', 'John', 'Schlesinger', '1965', 'gem', 'Darling', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'stunningly', 'provocative', 'demeanor', 'Darling', 'barrels', 'very', 'end', 'such', 'charisma', 'shockingly', 'endearing', 'kind', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'completely', 'engulfed', 'prose.Julie', 'Christie', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'young', 'determined', 'model', 'Diana', 'Scott', 'who', 'one', 'failed', 'relationship', 'struggle', 'make', 'young', 'immature', 'husband', 'older', 'gentleman', 'Robert', 'who', 'be', 'married', 'life', 'lessons', 'leave', 'feeling', 'overwhelmed', 'point', 'where', 'affair', 'suave', 'film', 'director', 'named', 'Miles', 'When', 'relationship', 'trying', 'men', 'up', 'friend', 'Malcolm', 'who', 'prefer', 'company', 'men', 'where', 'wealthy', 'Italian', 'Prince', 'Cesare', 'della', 'Romita', 'becoming', 'Princess.The', 'film', 'reminded', 'somewhat', 'Fellini', 'masterpiece', 'La', 'Dolce', 'Vita', 'especially', 'French', 'party', 'scene', 'seemed', 'obvious', 'influence', 'film', 'far', 'copy', 'cat', 'similar', 'themes', 'such', 'demoralization', 'high', 'society', 'so', 'unique', 'vision', 'own.They', 'are', 'definite', 'companion', 'pieces', 'recommend', 'watching', 'pair.What', 'admire', 'so', 'much', 'Darling', 'truly', 'fearless', 'film', 'still', 'tame', 'according', 'today', 'standards', 'can', 'call', 'really', 'intriguing', 'see', 'present', 'film', 'hesitation', 'performances', 'are', 'truly', 'lived', 'completely', 'felt', 'audience', 'script', 'stunningly', 'deep', 'never', 'truly', 'going', 'anywhere', 'norm', 'What', 'mean', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'Darling', 'Diana', 'relationships', 'way', 'relationship', 'explored', 'developed', 'place', 'deep', 'Diana', 'film', 'also', 'beautifully', 'Diana', 'outward', 'inward', 'personas', 'giving', 'woman', 'who', 'perceived', 'many', 'be', 'happy', 'one', 'campaigns', 'happy', 'girl', 'who', 'traumatically', 'unhappy', 'lot', 'life.This', 'head', 'films', 'rapturous', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Diana', 'literally', 'herself', 'everything', 'shatters', 'Everything', 'worked', 'so', 'hard', 'secure', 'proven', 'be', 'figurative', 'death', 'her.So', 'let', 'talk', 'acting', 'always', 'favorite', 'subject', 'mine', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'words', 'spoken', 'Christie', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'even', 'read', 'absurd', 'comment', 'IMDB', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'SEEN', 'movie', 'yet', 'Academy', 'must', 'be', 'blind', 'way', 'Christie', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'better', 'Andrews', ""'ll"", 'say', 'actress', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'year', 'best', 'performance', 'actress', 'leading', 'role', 'was', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'who', 'was', 'flawlessly', 'engaging', 'Pierrot', 'le', 'Fou', 'said', 'Andrews', 'Christie', 'were', 'wonderful', 'wholly', 'back', 'up', 'Christie', 'win', 'tapped', 'something', 'so', 'sincere', 'so', 'raw', 'way', 'Christie', 'characters', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'just', 'flawlessly', 'done', 'final', 'scene', 'Bogarde', 'just', 'mesmerizing', 'painful', 'Much', 'been', 'said', 'Bogarde', 'Harvey', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'were', 'phenomenal', 'Bogarde', 'may', 'even', 'win', 'personal', 'Best', 'Actor', 'award', 'year', 'stunning', 'sidewalk', 'confrontation', 'Christie', 'alone', 'worthy', 'award', 'feel', 'compelled', 'ignore', 'altogether', 'focus', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'get', 'mentioned', 'too', 'often.Roland', 'Curram.Roland', 'Malcolm', 'Diana', 'flirtatiously', 'dominate', 'friend', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'layered', 'very', 'memorable', 'facial', 'expression', 'way', 'scrutinize', 'as', 'honestly', 'friend', 'judging', 'so', 'obviously', 'not', 'threw', 'role', 'effortless', 'charisma', 'drew', 'him.In', 'end', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'Darling', 'sublime', 'film', 'ultimately', 'stirring', 'somewhat', 'depressing', 'look', 'emptiness', 'aspirations', 'remarkably', 'handled', 'fronts', 'blatant', 'honesty', 'fearless', 'embracing', 'culturally', 'taboo', 'make', 'film', 'absolute', 'treasure']",N/A

There is little I need to add except that I saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape.  I just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some.  Schlesinger's work, the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing, sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek ""happiness"" in all of the wrong places -- especially in the wrong people.  After the twenty-odd years of first viewing this film, I realized tonight how strong Julie Christie's performance is in this film.  There is not one hole in this bravura performance.  It's odd to make this statement, especially since she's playing such a shallow role.  It's not an easy nor a desirable part to play, but she carries it off as if she herself were the character.  Selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity, and she stoops and conquers.Laurence Harvey has never played the rogue better and Dirk Bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart, but nevertheless gives in (but not completely) to Ms. Christie's empty needs.  He, indeed, sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms.Emptiness served up brilliantly.

196663,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6300147258,Cowboy Buddha,"[12, 13]","Darling is one of the best films of the 1960's, with its sharp direction, even sharper script, atmospheric black and white photography, and three outstanding star performances. The style of the film may seem somewhat dated, but its substance still packs a considerable punch.The film involves its audience with genuine appeal to our emotions and intellect, rather than in the manipulative manner of many more modern movies. Darling makes us think and challenges us to feel. Although very much a reflection of its time, Darling still has very much to say to us today. It is sad, therefore, that some of those involved in its making tend to distance themselves from it now. Maybe their subsequent careers have made them resemble the film's targets more than its protagonists. If nothing else, Darling is populated by real people - some of whom are sometimes uncomfortably realistic.It is perhaps difficult to realise now how shocking a character Julie Christie was portraying at the time - in those uptight days when free love and liberated women were only just beginning to surface into public awareness. The audience was asked to feel sympathy for this middle class girl who bed-hopped her way from model to princess with barely a hint of conscience. Perhaps she was intended to be another British anti-hero - a female cousin of Jimmy Porter, Joe Lampton or Arthur Seaton. Or maybe she was the prophetic face of the future - the sixties symbol that everything was changing. Whatever the intention, the character of Diana Scott made a definite impact, both on the men in her life and on the audiences who watched her with a mixture of fascination, disbelief, and quite possibly a touch of envy.The film's solid foundation - some might say its heart and soul - lies in the wordly wise and wickedly witty script by Frederic Raphael. His characters are equally blessed with sarcasm and faults - they all have a knack for delivering wonderful one-liners in moments of crisis. Example - When Dirk Bogarde parts for the last time from Christie, he tells her that he intends to write a book about his life. Christie says that she played the biggest part in his life. Bogarde raises an eyebrow and replies quietly: &quot;Certainly the most melodramatic&quot;.It is precisely this contrast between Christie's emotional rollercoaster and Bogarde's coolly calculated underplaying that provides most of the film's best moments. Although Laurence Harvey also makes a significant contribution. I have always felt that Harvey was a seriously under-rated actor and here he proves just how effective he could be. Christies may have been the romantic face of a changing Britain, but Harvey was the realistic symbol of how things really worked - of the British obsession with class, appearance, self-interest and hyprocrisy that still exists today. It says much for Dirk Bogarde that he gives the best performance while playing the least believable character. Stranger still, that Gregory Peck was once considered for the role.If I have gone on about the stars more than the direction or music or anything like that, it is because this is essentially a film about people. The plot is not so much about what happens to them but how these events affect and change them. The camerawork is occasionally flashy but never intrusive. Sometimes the film looks almost like a documentary, an illusion helped by a first-rate supporting cast. But, more than anything else, this is Julie Christie's film - she is as faultless as she is natural. She won an Oscar for playing Diane Scott. But Darling deserves more than awards - it deserves to be seen.",5,"When Julie Christie was good, she was very good...",1024531200,"06 20, 2002",2002,3617,"['Darling', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1960', 'sharp', 'direction', 'even', 'sharper', 'script', 'atmospheric', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'three', 'outstanding', 'star', 'performances', 'style', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'substance', 'still', 'considerable', 'punch.The', 'film', 'audience', 'genuine', 'appeal', 'emotions', 'intellect', 'rather', 'manipulative', 'manner', 'many', 'more', 'modern', 'movies', 'Darling', 'think', 'feel', 'very', 'much', 'reflection', 'time', 'Darling', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'say', 'today', 'sad', 'therefore', 'involved', 'making', 'tend', 'distance', 'now', 'Maybe', 'subsequent', 'careers', 'have', 'made', 'resemble', 'film', 'targets', 'more', 'protagonists', 'nothing', 'else', 'Darling', 'populated', 'real', 'people', 'whom', 'are', 'sometimes', 'uncomfortably', 'realistic.It', 'perhaps', 'difficult', 'realise', 'now', 'how', 'shocking', 'character', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'was', 'portraying', 'time', 'uptight', 'days', 'when', 'free', 'love', 'liberated', 'women', 'were', 'only', 'just', 'beginning', 'surface', 'public', 'awareness', 'audience', 'was', 'asked', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'middle', 'class', 'girl', 'who', 'bed-hopped', 'way', 'model', 'princess', 'barely', 'hint', 'conscience', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'intended', 'be', 'British', 'anti-hero', 'female', 'cousin', 'Jimmy', 'Porter', 'Joe', 'Lampton', 'Arthur', 'Seaton', 'maybe', 'was', 'prophetic', 'face', 'future', 'sixties', 'symbol', 'everything', 'was', 'changing', 'intention', 'character', 'Diana', 'Scott', 'made', 'definite', 'impact', 'men', 'life', 'audiences', 'who', 'watched', 'mixture', 'fascination', 'disbelief', 'quite', 'possibly', 'touch', 'envy.The', 'film', 'solid', 'foundation', 'might', 'say', 'heart', 'soul', 'wordly', 'wise', 'wickedly', 'witty', 'script', 'Frederic', 'Raphael', 'characters', 'are', 'equally', 'blessed', 'sarcasm', 'faults', 'have', 'knack', 'delivering', 'wonderful', 'one-liners', 'moments', 'crisis', 'Example', 'When', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'parts', 'last', 'time', 'Christie', 'write', 'book', 'life', 'Christie', 'played', 'biggest', 'part', 'life', 'Bogarde', 'eyebrow', 'replies', 'quietly', 'quot', 'Certainly', 'most', 'melodramatic', 'quot', 'precisely', 'contrast', 'Christie', 'emotional', 'rollercoaster', 'Bogarde', 'coolly', 'calculated', 'underplaying', 'most', 'film', 'best', 'moments', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'also', 'significant', 'contribution', 'have', 'always', 'felt', 'Harvey', 'was', 'seriously', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'here', 'just', 'how', 'effective', 'could', 'be', 'Christies', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'romantic', 'face', 'changing', 'Britain', 'Harvey', 'was', 'realistic', 'symbol', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'worked', 'British', 'obsession', 'class', 'appearance', 'self-interest', 'hyprocrisy', 'still', 'today', 'much', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'best', 'performance', 'playing', 'least', 'believable', 'character', 'Stranger', 'still', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'once', 'considered', 'role.If', 'have', 'gone', 'stars', 'more', 'direction', 'music', 'anything', 'essentially', 'film', 'people', 'plot', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'how', 'events', 'affect', 'change', 'camerawork', 'occasionally', 'flashy', 'never', 'intrusive', 'Sometimes', 'film', 'almost', 'documentary', 'illusion', 'helped', 'first-rate', 'supporting', 'cast', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'film', 'as', 'faultless', 'natural', 'won', 'Oscar', 'playing', 'Diane', 'Scott', 'Darling', 'deserves', 'more', 'awards', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

196665,A3NKSSHDJBE6T,6300147258,Eric Marshall,"[9, 57]","This line, spoken by Julie Christie to Dirk Bogarde in ""Darling"" just about sums up my feelings towards this movie. Although I am halfway done with this movie I think this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen and I am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where Christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing. I am done with this movie (believe it or not) and it only got worse: Christie's character Diana Scott marries an Italian man who hello, is old enough to be father! And oh yes, he's an aging prince (in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to Grace Kelly and what would happen to Jacqueline Kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her ""Princess Diana"" almost made me laugh). That nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my TV (a la Elvis Presley) considering that this is the same setup that occurs in ""Georgy Girl"" and that is spoiled British girl living in Swinging England marries older man (Three words: Anna Nicole Smith). Also, I would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that Christie deserved the Oscar for Best Actress? She didn't at all because it should (and I mean SHOULD) of gone to Julie Andrews for ""The Sound of Music"" (my pick for the best movie of the 1960's) because not only did she overtake her performance of ""Mary Poppins,"" for which she won the Oscar, she pulverized every performance by a female that year including Christie. And there's a problem with the Academy: They can't seem to pull the trigger in giving back-to-back Oscars to the same person.I'm not alone in this arugment: In Danny Perry's book ""Alternate Oscars"" he picks Andrews for Best Actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the AMPAS gave the Oscar to Christie was not because it was 'The British Invasion,' but they saw it as a way to give an Oscar to Christie's other film ""Doctor Zhivago"" which was T.S.O.M.'s rival and added to the fact that ""Zhivago"" had no acting nominations. There's another Oscar problem: They don't know when to be hip.Also, does it seem like Dirk Bogarde and Lawrence Harvey were the two worst actors in film history? Because it seems to me that every movie that I have seen with them are bad; weather it was this movie, or ""The Manchurian Candidate"" with Harvey, or ""Modesty Blaise"" with Bogarde.In conclusion, I think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an Oscar.

196670,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6300147258,K. Boullosa,"[9, 10]","""Darling"", the brittle mid-1960s cult classic, was written by Frederick Raphael (he won an Oscar for the script) and directed by John Schlesinger. Like a handful of other interesting black and white films from this era written by authors like Raphael and Alan Sillitoe, ""Darling"" has dated somewhat, although not in a way that devalues its superb qualities.  Think, for example, of ""Morgan!"", ""Georgy Girl"", and ""The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner"".  Although these are all very different films, each reflects something of Britain's mood during the early to mid-1960s as Britain questioned, particularly through the medium of theatre and film, issues of class loyalty, tradition, and values in a period of shifting social mores.The film is most noteworthy for the excellence of the script and the performances of its two leads, Julie Christie and Dirk Bogarde.  Although Christie won a Best Actress Oscar for her role, in this reviewer's opinion, Dirk Bogarde's performance is even more memorable.  This is not to belittle Christie's fine work; however, Christie was the startling newcomer and naturally attracted more attention than the established Bogarde, whose work here is so good as to be ""invisible"".  It is easy to forget what a very, very, very fine actor Bogarde was until you revisit a film like this.  It is a long way from Sidney Carton in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" to Robert Gold in ""Darling"".Christie plays Diana Scott, a beautiful but curiously blank woman who uses her looks to attach a series of increasingly prominent and wealthy men, in hopes that each successive relationship will finally help her achieve the solid identity she craves.  Christie portrays Diana as an empty canvas upon which she invites her lovers to paint, as she adapts herself, chameleon-like, to each one's values and tastes.  But Diana selects her lovers on the basis of their worldly assets, which cannot help her clarify her own identity, any more than those assets wholly define the identities of the men who hold them.  Diana never comes to understand this, and steps Gatsby-like over one man after another, evading responsibility for the emotional chaos she creates, yet never quite finding the one relationship that will make her feel real and complete.  In fact, Diana Scott rather reminds one of a later charismatic, British, blonde Diana, who also tried to anchor a narcissistic, internal vagueness through external relationships - with equally little success.Bogarde plays Robert Gold, a TV journalist who meets the pretty housewife accidentally and gives her a start in modeling - he falls hopelessly in love with her and leaves his wife and children for her.  But, as Diana's career takes off, she begins to drift toward men who she believes have more to offer her than Robert does.  Robert soon grasps the empty narcissism that produces Diana's vague amorality, but cannot shake free of his feeling for her, with tragic consequences for himself.  Ironically, Robert is the one man in Diana's life who loves her for ""herself"" - the very ""self"" she is seeking in other places.  As Diana joins the restless 1960s jet-set, the film highlights the equally narcissistic, quickly jaded characters and tastes of its members.Christie's look is also redolent of the era: the heavy eye-makeup, thick hair, jaunty mini-skirts, and Couregges boots, all have the peculiar effect of deadening, rather than enhancing her beauty, so perfectly iconic of the 1960s.The black and white photography is by Ken Higgins, and the supporting cast includes the always fascinating Laurence Harvey as the cold, calculating Miles Brand, another of Diana's lovers.This is an expertly crafted film, from script to direction to performances.  To say that it is ""dated"" is to use the term to express only its cultural specificity.  The anguish of its characters and the quality of its script ensure that its specificity does not dilute its broader relevance.""Darling"" is a fine classic of the 1960s, containing marvellous performances by now-legendary actors - it is a film truly made for adults.",4,Running on Empty in the Swingin' Sixties,1209945600,"05 5, 2008",2008,4073,"['Darling', 'brittle', 'mid-1960s', 'cult', 'classic', 'was', 'written', 'Frederick', 'Raphael', 'won', 'Oscar', 'script', 'directed', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'handful', 'other', 'interesting', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'era', 'written', 'authors', 'Raphael', 'Alan', 'Sillitoe', 'Darling', 'dated', 'somewhat', 'not', 'way', 'superb', 'qualities', 'Think', 'example', 'Morgan', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'Loneliness', 'Long-Distance', 'Runner', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'something', 'Britain', 'mood', 'early', 'mid-1960s', 'Britain', 'questioned', 'particularly', 'medium', 'theatre', 'film', 'issues', 'class', 'loyalty', 'tradition', 'values', 'period', 'shifting', 'social', 'mores.The', 'film', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'excellence', 'script', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'Christie', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'role', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'performance', 'even', 'more', 'memorable', 'not', 'belittle', 'Christie', 'fine', 'work', 'however', 'Christie', 'was', 'startling', 'newcomer', 'naturally', 'attracted', 'more', 'attention', 'established', 'Bogarde', 'work', 'here', 'so', 'good', 'be', 'invisible', 'easy', 'forget', 'what', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'Bogarde', 'was', 'revisit', 'film', 'long', 'way', 'Sidney', 'Carton', 'A', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cities', 'Robert', 'Gold', 'Darling', '.Christie', 'Diana', 'Scott', 'beautiful', 'curiously', 'blank', 'woman', 'who', 'looks', 'attach', 'series', 'increasingly', 'prominent', 'wealthy', 'men', 'hopes', 'successive', 'relationship', 'will', 'finally', 'help', 'achieve', 'solid', 'identity', 'Christie', 'Diana', 'empty', 'canvas', 'lovers', 'paint', 'chameleon-like', 'one', 'values', 'tastes', 'Diana', 'lovers', 'basis', 'worldly', 'assets', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'clarify', 'own', 'identity', 'more', 'assets', 'wholly', 'define', 'identities', 'men', 'who', 'hold', 'Diana', 'never', 'understand', 'steps', 'Gatsby-like', 'one', 'man', 'evading', 'responsibility', 'emotional', 'chaos', 'yet', 'never', 'quite', 'finding', 'one', 'relationship', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'real', 'complete', 'fact', 'Diana', 'Scott', 'rather', 'one', 'later', 'charismatic', 'British', 'blonde', 'Diana', 'who', 'also', 'tried', 'anchor', 'narcissistic', 'internal', 'vagueness', 'external', 'relationships', 'equally', 'little', 'success.Bogarde', 'plays', 'Robert', 'Gold', 'TV', 'journalist', 'who', 'pretty', 'housewife', 'accidentally', 'start', 'modeling', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'wife', 'children', 'Diana', 'career', 'off', 'drift', 'men', 'who', 'have', 'more', 'offer', 'Robert', 'Robert', 'soon', 'grasps', 'empty', 'narcissism', 'Diana', 'vague', 'amorality', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'free', 'feeling', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'Ironically', 'Robert', 'one', 'man', 'Diana', 'life', 'who', 'very', 'self', 'seeking', 'other', 'places', 'Diana', 'restless', '1960s', 'jet-set', 'film', 'equally', 'narcissistic', 'quickly', 'jaded', 'characters', 'tastes', 'members.Christie', 'look', 'also', 'redolent', 'era', 'heavy', 'eye-makeup', 'thick', 'hair', 'jaunty', 'mini-skirts', 'Couregges', 'boots', 'have', 'peculiar', 'effect', 'deadening', 'rather', 'enhancing', 'beauty', 'so', 'perfectly', 'iconic', '1960s.The', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'Ken', 'Higgins', 'supporting', 'cast', 'always', 'fascinating', 'Laurence', 'Harvey', 'cold', 'calculating', 'Miles', 'Brand', 'Diana', 'lovers.This', 'expertly', 'crafted', 'film', 'script', 'direction', 'performances', 'say', 'dated', 'use', 'term', 'express', 'only', 'cultural', 'specificity', 'anguish', 'characters', 'quality', 'script', 'ensure', 'specificity', 'not', 'dilute', 'broader', 'relevance', 'Darling', 'fine', 'classic', '1960s', 'containing', 'marvellous', 'performances', 'now-legendary', 'actors', 'film', 'truly', 'made', 'adults']",N/A

Eventually, they leave their respective mates and set up house together in swinging London. All is not hunky dory for long, as Julie goes on to have an affair with her agent, Miles, divinely played by Laurence Harvey. When Robert discovers her lies and infidelity, he leaves her.Diana goes on to party hearty, and she ultimately meets a wealthy and widowed, Italian prince while on location in Italy shooting a commercial. After a perfunctory meeting, she meets up with him again, and he proposes. She thinks about his proposal, and ultimately consents to becoming Princess Diana.Only after marrying him, a virtual stranger to her, does she realize how lonely she is. She finds herself being left in their palazzo with his seven children, while the prince is away, ostensibly visiting his mother without her. She realizes that she is living in a gilded cage, no more than a trophy wife.She impulsively contacts Robert and flies to England to meet with him. After they make love, she realizes how much she loved him, and declares her feelings for him, only to be rebuffed. He then sends her packing, back to her empty life in Italy. Yet, he does so at great emotional cost to himself, as well.This film is very representative of the swinging sixties and conveys a real sense of the joie de vivre of the period. It deals with subjects that were formerly taboo. There are subtle and sly references to homosexuality. Abortion and a woman's sexuality are issues in the film and dealt with in a way with which these issues were not ordinarily dealt. While it may seem tame by today's standards, this was very cutting edge in its time, and reflective of some of the changes which society, as a whole, was undergoing.

We've met her type before -- the kind as to whom you might mistake the looks, the desperate hugs, the spirited lovemaking, and the promises as reflective of human depth when, in fact, they are mere shadows and masks concealing a vain emptiness.The men she entangles seemingly should know better, but we find that they, too, are bereft of heart and of character, and largely self-deluded or self-absorbed.

196676,A3QFC8X23IR3QC,6300147258,"Michael C. Smith ""MGMboy@aol.com""","[8, 8]","""Darling"" is a searing look into the shallow life of a London girl during the mid-60's. It stars Julie Christie in the title role of Diana Scott and takes us through a few years of her life from mod-model to wife of an Italian prince. Dianna's messy life and total disregard for others is brilliantly shown through the convention of her telling ""My Story"" to a magazine while contrasting her tale with the actual facts of her life.Co-stars Dirk Bogarde, Laurence Harvey each serves the story in their unique and gifted ways. Bogarde as Robert Gold is Diana's one brush with real emotion and possible salvation is at the top of his form giving yet another fine performance in support of Miss Christie. Laurence Harvey is cold and calculating as the bored playboy Miles Brand. He has never been better or has his angular face been shown to be more sardonic and deceitful than here in this film.The direction by John Schlesinger is razor sharp and never misses the truth behind each scene. Cinematographer Kenneth Higgins captures the feel of mid-60's London, Pairs and Italy in crisp and clean shots. His close-ups are nearly surgical in what they render visible to the eye.John Dankworth executed the composition of one of the most haunting themes from the sixties, which plays over the brilliant opening credits. His score is perfect and underscores Diana's story so well.Finally there is Julie Christie in her Oscar winning performance.  What a revelation this film and Miss Christie were at the time. Movies were changing so rapidly from what they had been all along to a more adult and honest look at life. The cracks began to appear after WW II. They widened in the 1950's but by the time ""Darling' came along the movie industry had changed, imploded then exploded into a new and freer form of expression. Riding this wave to triumph in 1965 was the nearly unknown Miss Christie. Her Diana is unapologetic, raw and wonderful.

It left an indelible impression on me, but not because of the witty dialogue or well-crafted cinematography. It was Julie Christie who drew me in, and many years later on my first viewing of the complete film, it is Christie who continues to beckon me, but not just with her beauty.Handing an up-and-coming star so much screen time (or shall we call it ""face time"") as director Schlesinger did in ""Darling"" can be a risky proposition, but it pays off handsomely here. Christie truly deserved her Oscar for this emotionally wide-ranging, nicely nuanced performance of a narcissistic social climber in the ""Swinging Sixties."" She's adroitly paired with Dirk Bogarde to create an ""owl and pussycat"" story line, and Laurence Harvey is brought in as a manipulative, sexually ambiguous poseur who shows ""Diana"" the darker side of success. (Harvey's selection was somewhat ironic given his own ""climb the ladder"" character in ""Room at the Top."")""Darling"" offers a true-to-life window into the growing glitterati subculture that was starting to flower after the Fifties. Most of the main characters make their living through the creation of images (a model, television personality, photographer, advertising man and revered writer), and Diana learns how to use her assets in this milieu most effectively. For all her conquests, all her connections, and all her globetrotting, the broadest, most genuine smiles come across her face when she is ""in the moment"" with her gay photographer friend or children - individuals who do not threaten to shatter her glass-like personality. Unfortunately, that apparent happiness is not to be sustained by the time the film ends.Visually, ""Darling"" is a delight. The opening sequence, in which a poster on world hunger is papered over with a close-up of model Diana, effectively sets the stage for a steady string of sardonic observations by screenwriter Rafael, especially in the charity dinner and art gallery sequences. The episode in the Parisian salon comes off as a psychologically troubling mixture of Fellini freaks and the beach scene in ""Suddenly Last Summer"", and the cottage and verandah scene on the Italian Riviera is simply stunning. Director Schlesinger could easily have opted for color, but wisely chose black-and-white as befit the plot line and moral ambiguity of many of his characters.About the only criticism one might make of this film is the too-obvious post-colonial moralizing about ""haves"" and ""have nots.""

196680,A2LDKVHYK36GUJ,6300147258,Peter Shilpot Freeman,"[6, 6]","Darling is like nothing you would see today, this is largely due to its maturity. It is a 'grown-up' film made by adults, about adults for an adult audience.It is the tale of a very good looking young woman who rides with the wave that her good looks take her on.Diana Scott (Christie) starts out a care-free young thing, swinging along the streets of mid-sixties London when she is stopped by a reporter and asked if she'd like to make a comment about 'today's youth' for a magazine TV programme. She is so flattered that she falls for the reporter who swiftly leaves his wife for her.But after a while Julie gets bored and wants to expeience more of what this brave new sixties world has to offer &amp; we the audience travel along with her for the journey...from model to film star to finally capturing the eye of an Italian prince who marries her.She becomes Princess Diana trapped in a palace with only her misery for company.Julie Christie's character is supposed to be an immoral girl but you can't help but like her. Watching this film is like going on a journey through someone else's life to such a degree that you will forget your own after a while as you follow her around from Paris to Italy,through her various flings,friendships &amp; encounters.No special effects here,Darling is about people. People living in the 'contemporary' world.The film has dated 'terribly'...that's part of its fascination. It's a mid-sixties time capsule. If you are a fan of or are at all interested in 'sixties London buy this with confidence. It is a privilege to be  be able to recommend it to you.Darling is a witty film. Intelligently made. Superbly shot &amp; edited. I would recommend it to anyone who is studying film, so fluently &amp; deftly is this masterpiece put together.Filmed in Black &amp; White...not only does Julie Christie look stunning but she rises to every note. She well deserved her Oscar for best actress in 1966.This is a movie that would interest &amp; entertain even the people who usually would not be drawn to  this kind of a theme.Highly recommended!",5,Deserves SIX stars!,1002844800,"10 12, 2001",2001,2077,"['Darling', 'nothing', 'would', 'see', 'today', 'largely', 'due', 'maturity', ""'grown-up"", 'film', 'made', 'adults', 'adults', 'adult', 'audience.It', 'tale', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'wave', 'good', 'looks', 'take', 'on.Diana', 'Scott', 'Christie', 'out', 'care-free', 'young', 'thing', 'swinging', 'streets', 'mid-sixties', 'London', 'when', 'stopped', 'reporter', 'asked', ""'d"", 'like', 'make', 'comment', ""'today"", 'youth', 'magazine', 'TV', 'programme', 'so', 'flattered', 'reporter', 'who', 'swiftly', 'wife', 'her.But', 'while', 'Julie', 'bored', 'expeience', 'more', 'what', 'brave', 'new', 'sixties', 'world', 'offer', 'amp', 'audience', 'travel', 'journey', 'model', 'film', 'star', 'finally', 'capturing', 'eye', 'Italian', 'prince', 'who', 'her.She', 'Princess', 'Diana', 'trapped', 'palace', 'only', 'misery', 'company.Julie', 'Christie', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'immoral', 'girl', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Watching', 'film', 'going', 'journey', 'someone', 'else', 'life', 'degree', 'will', 'forget', 'own', 'while', 'follow', 'Paris', 'Italy', 'various', 'flings', 'friendships', 'amp', 'special', 'effects', 'here', 'Darling', 'people', 'People', 'living', ""'contemporary"", 'world.The', 'film', 'dated', ""'terribly"", 'part', 'fascination', 'mid-sixties', 'time', 'capsule', 'are', 'fan', 'are', 'interested', ""'sixties"", 'London', 'buy', 'confidence', 'privilege', 'be', 'be', 'able', 'recommend', 'you.Darling', 'witty', 'film', 'Intelligently', 'made', 'Superbly', 'shot', 'amp', 'edited', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'studying', 'film', 'so', 'fluently', 'amp', 'deftly', 'masterpiece', 'put', 'together.Filmed', 'Black', 'amp', 'White', 'not', 'only', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'look', 'stunning', 'note', 'well', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'best', 'actress', '1966.This', 'movie', 'would', 'interest', 'amp', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'usually', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'kind', 'theme.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
