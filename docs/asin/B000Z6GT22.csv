1121347,A1L39B3I6KC7M2,B000Z6GT22,burritobrother,"[1, 6]","""Blue Hawaii"" is one of Elvis Presley's most popular films. The only reason I can come up with is that it includes the classic 'Can't Help Falling In Love', one of his best ballads. Otherwise, it's a mediocre film, the one that cemented the ""Elvis movie"" genre, and the first one Presley himself would loathe. But he plays along, and it's not nearly as bad as most of the musicals that would follow.One of these is the next film here, ""Paradise Hawaiian Style"". Quite possibly the worst movie he ever made, with horrible songs, no story to speak of, bad camerawork, etc. etc. Elvis shows his disgust, not even bothering to pretend to be enjoying himself. What's more, Elvis is notably overweight and obviously out of it (not that anyone could blame him). It's sad to watch this movie and see the state of his career in 1966. Noone else could have survived a movie this horrendous.But both of these films are here for a low price, so the Elvis devoted among us can add this set to their shelf without losing much money doing it.",3,Inexpensive set,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",2008,1027,"['Blue', 'Hawaii', 'one', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'most', 'popular', 'films', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'classic', ""n't"", 'Help', 'Falling', 'Love', 'one', 'best', 'ballads', 'Otherwise', 'mediocre', 'film', 'one', 'cemented', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'genre', 'first', 'one', 'Presley', 'would', 'loathe', 'along', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'musicals', 'would', 'follow.One', 'next', 'film', 'here', 'Paradise', 'Hawaiian', 'Style', 'Quite', 'possibly', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'horrible', 'songs', 'story', 'speak', 'bad', 'camerawork', 'etc', 'etc', 'Elvis', 'disgust', 'not', 'even', 'bothering', 'pretend', 'be', 'enjoying', 'What', 'more', 'Elvis', 'notably', 'overweight', 'obviously', 'not', 'anyone', 'could', 'blame', 'sad', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'state', 'career', '1966', 'Noone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'survived', 'movie', 'films', 'are', 'here', 'low', 'price', 'Elvis', 'devoted', 'can', 'add', 'set', 'shelf', 'losing', 'much', 'money', 'doing']","Blue Hawaii / Paradise, Hawaiian Style"

I wanted to hop on a plane and have my own Hawaiian adventures after watching these moves.  Sing a few songs, have a brawl, get the girl, that's the whole plot.

Blue Hawaii stars Angela Landsbury as his doting mother, while Paradise Hawaiian Style co-stars James Shigeta whom I know from Flower Drum Song. The scenery is breathtaking in both, with plenty of palm, trees, blue skies, flowers, and Hawaiians. I liked the young girl in Paradise Hawaiian Style who belts out Bill Bailey though I am sure the voice was dubbed. Still, she was cute and very expressive. I liked the songs in both, especially the one at the end of Paradise Hawaiian Style with locals beating the drums that resound over the others at the ceremony. Harmless fun and nothing especially deep. Lots of color, laughs, and fun.
