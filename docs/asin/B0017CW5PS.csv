You're not going to find the best of him here. For that, save your money and look up anything by ""Derek & Clive"" or the original ""Bedazzled"" along with Peter Cook.

These movies have to be the best fun you will spend watching and sitting for a few hours.  Prepare to laugh hysterically and see the other side of life from a British person's point of view.
