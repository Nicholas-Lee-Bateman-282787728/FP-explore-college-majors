1362297,A3PA3GP2SZFHJQ,B003TNS3JA,cheryl,"[6, 20]","Being able to buy and afford movies that have values instead of violence, sex  and mayhem is a blessing for us.My husband and I grew up in an era where people actually lived lives that did not put what they did or what they wereout in public. There has always been perverts, criminals, nut-cases, etc., and there always will be. Only problem withthat today is that it is an accepted way of life. God did not create man to be homosexual, deviate, selfish, cunning, cruel,etc.He created man after His own image for friendship, peace, love, harmony. Man fell into sin in the garden of Eden and the devil was givencontrol over him. People say God made them that way, that's not true. The devil has his own ways and can devise ways for man to becomediscouraged and disallussioned.The devil and his band of fallen angels have inter-mingled with the world and created their own.The movies we choose are how God wants our lives to be. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins and bring us salvation so that we can have a Heavenly home with Him instead of going to the fires of hell for all eternity. While most stories are fictional,the "" Hiding Place"" is not. It is the true life story of Corrie TenBoom and how God used her to lead others to Him even in the worst of times. God NEVER promised to deliver us from the horrors of this reprobate world, He promised to walk with us through all the circumstance and we would spend eternity in glory with Him. Want to know more?
