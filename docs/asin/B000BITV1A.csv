943003,A20EEWWSFMZ1PN,B000BITV1A,"bernie ""xyzzy""","[7, 11]","This is a very helpful series. For all those people that read ""Home and Garden"" you now have a program that shows the upside to farming.This is the Complete third season, consisting of 696 minutes of run time; so I suggest that you start early in the day if you have to work tomorrow. And do not be too impulsive and rush out to buy that farm. The package comes with two DVDs and a pamphlet describing in brief each episode. However you better have good eyes as both sides of the DVD are recorded on, leaving no room for labeling.Fort many this is the first time to be introduced to such strong acting characters as Arnold (rumor has it became dinner at the end of the series). For the rest of us, we have an opportunity to visit old friends and see an episode or two that may have been missed. With any luck we will have the opportunity to buy the next season.Oliver Wendell Douglas, born on a farm, and stayed there for two days, wants to get back to his roots. The opportunity arises and he purchases the Haney place from Eustace Charleton Haney himself. His wife gets the opportunity to share with him the challenges to adjust to the farm life?The third is more outfield than the second However it never loses that something that makes you addicted to the series and want more.There is an urban legend that when the series finished Arnold became lunch.If you appreciate this fine program than you will enjoy reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes, where the story is retold Italian style.Green Acres - Seasons 1-3",5,Original reality based TV,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,1526,"['very', 'helpful', 'series', 'people', 'read', 'Home', 'Garden', 'now', 'have', 'program', 'upside', 'farming.This', 'Complete', 'third', 'season', 'consisting', '696', 'minutes', 'run', 'time', 'suggest', 'start', 'early', 'day', 'have', 'work', 'tomorrow', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'too', 'impulsive', 'out', 'buy', 'farm', 'package', 'two', 'DVDs', 'pamphlet', 'describing', 'brief', 'episode', 'However', 'better', 'have', 'good', 'eyes', 'sides', 'DVD', 'are', 'recorded', 'leaving', 'room', 'labeling.Fort', 'many', 'first', 'time', 'be', 'introduced', 'such', 'strong', 'acting', 'characters', 'Arnold', 'rumor', 'became', 'dinner', 'end', 'series', 'rest', 'have', 'opportunity', 'visit', 'old', 'friends', 'see', 'episode', 'two', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'missed', 'luck', 'will', 'have', 'opportunity', 'buy', 'next', 'season.Oliver', 'Wendell', 'Douglas', 'born', 'farm', 'stayed', 'two', 'days', 'get', 'back', 'roots', 'opportunity', 'arises', 'purchases', 'Haney', 'place', 'Eustace', 'Charleton', 'Haney', 'wife', 'opportunity', 'share', 'challenges', 'adjust', 'farm', 'life', 'third', 'more', 'outfield', 'second', 'However', 'never', 'something', 'addicted', 'series', 'want', 'urban', 'legend', 'when', 'series', 'finished', 'Arnold', 'became', 'lunch.If', 'appreciate', 'fine', 'program', 'will', 'enjoy', 'reading', 'Tuscan', 'Sun', 'Frances', 'Mayes', 'where', 'story', 'retold', 'Italian', 'style.Green', 'Acres', 'Seasons', '1-3']",Green Acres: Season 3

But the writing and acting in Green Acres reached a new high for sitcom zaniness, mostly driven by the chemistry between the ever- stylish Eva Gabor and her comedic foil, Eddie Albert. With the third season the show hit its pace as a nearly perfect personality-driven sitcom. The third season featured nearly the entire cast: Eb, Mr. Haney, Alf and Ralph, and increasingly starred Arnold, as Nick at Nite ads called him, ""the Love Pig.""

But its inspired lunacy, with hints of everything from old radio comedy to Theatre of the Absurd, has been a major influence on shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""NewsRadio"" (which is where the quote in the title comes from).  Creator Jay Sommers wrote every episode with his story consultant Dick Chevillat, and instead of bland sitcom scrapes and sentimentality, they filled their scripts with satire, meta-humor and outright weirdness.  No one can forget the various ways the characters noticed the opening credits, or the fact that most characters can hear the fife music playing under Oliver's rants about ""The American Farmer,"" or the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Ziffel think a pig is their son (something that is taken for granted by everyone except Oliver).The show started out fairly normal in season 1, turned weird and wonderful in season 2, and by season 3 was at its peak, with memorable episodes like ""The Rutabaga Story"" and the two-parter where Arnold (yes, the pig) gets a chance at Hollywood stardom.

We get to know all of the screwball story characters better than we do our own neighbors. The 2nd season isn't much different than the first. By the third season, you can tell that the writers are beginning to run out of ideas.The Ziffels was a key element of the show. Fred, Doris & their son, Arnold, made for several wonderful episodes. The only member of the family that could be replaced was Arnold. He may have been able to do a lot of things that his human counterparts couldn't do, but after all, he was just a pig.The original Doris Ziffel was played by Barbara Pepper, who died in 1969. She was replaced by Fran Ryan. It's not that Ryan didn't do a good job as playing Doris, it's that she just wan't Doris Ziffel. None of the Green Acres characters are replaceable. The show would have been better off had Fred just become a widower.I don't think this show could have have handled a fourth season. That's the feeling you get while watching this Third Season. Even the glamorous Eva Gabor shows the signs of age and seeing her husband still doing the farming in his trademark three-piece suit is no longer a novelty. Even Arnold the pig isn't funny any longer.The quality of the DVDs is excellent & Season Three, in my opinion, is worth buying. It is a Must Have for Green Acre fans.

They make us wait well over a year for another set of these to come out. Season 3 came out in December 2005, 13 months ago. I see all of these box sets of series in their entirity which were lame compared to Green Acres. Reality shows get box sets, tv series of today are released almost immediately when the seasons are over and yet, MGM keeps jerking us Green Acres fans around. Has anyone tried writing to them on their website? Has anyone ever gotten an answer from them? I think they give us the standard ""due to vast volumes of mail we receive, we cant answer individual letters."" Yeah, right. They used to have a phone number which I tried calling but all I got was an answer machine. Now their phone number is a Best Buy telephone number. You would have better luck talking to a wall instead of talking to one of their representatives. They dont know a thing about when season 4 will come out.
