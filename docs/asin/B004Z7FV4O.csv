The consumer deserves it with the modern technology. Still I watch these and never fail to laugh.  Quality was good for the time they were made.  More than worth the money.  This show will never die because it is downright funny. It was shot at a time when people were wanting to laugh and not inflict pain.

1434438,A34XOL0421NCVP,B004Z7FV4O,"Christopher Cline ""Film Lover""","[2, 2]","You know, I have read some reviews on Amazon regarding these DVD's which complain about the ""quality"" of them. Well, while I agree that there is a possibility that the DVD's might have been transferred at a higher resolution (SP instead of SLP, etc..), it MUST be remembered how long ago these Episodes were on TV and how RARE they seem to be. I have NEVER seen a ""studio"" release of these, PROBABLY due to their ""controversial"" nature back when this was a LONG running radio series and the main African-American characters were played by White actors (Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, who produced these TV episodes), and so I think an ""official"" studio release from remastered master tapes (or FILM!) is HIGHLY unlikely! This is a crying shame, because these episodes are HILARIOUS! The black actors who portrayed the characters on TV fit their roles PERFECTLY and are ALL talented and VERY funny! The short recording on Disc 1 where the TV actors were introduced IN CHARACTER by Correll and Gosden to a live studio audience before the first episode filmed, shows how amazing the casting was for this series! Again, the quality is pretty standard for a series which is THIS old and probably wasn't transferred from studio master material. People who complain about that are being UNREALISTIC in their expectations. We are LUCKY that someone out there has preserved this wonderful comedy and makes it available to all of us for quite a reasonable price, I might add! If you are a ""mediaphile"", and insist that all that you watch has to be High Definition, then this collection IS NOT going to satisfy you. Again, that is an unrealistic expectation. One of my other favorite series from the early days of television is ""The Honeymooners"", which WAS released officially on DVD by the studio and even some of THOSE episodes are not of the highest resolution or sharpest quality, but that is o.k. when you remember you are watching shows which were televised not long after the end of World War II! OF COURSE, I wish too that the quality was higher, but I am THRILLED to have these in my collection and to be able to watch them anytime I want to return to Brooklyn and watch the exploits and adventures of my favorite Mystic Knights of the Sea Lodge!!! I HIGHLY recommend this product for those who loved this series and can appreciate their rarity and comic genius!",4,Just AWESOME to have these AT ALL!!!,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,2366,"['know', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'Amazon', 'regarding', 'DVD', 'complain', 'quality', 'Well', 'agree', 'possibility', 'DVD', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'higher', 'resolution', 'SP', 'instead', 'SLP', 'etc..', 'MUST', 'be', 'remembered', 'how', 'long', 'ago', 'Episodes', 'were', 'TV', 'how', 'RARE', 'seem', 'be', 'have', 'NEVER', 'seen', 'studio', 'release', 'PROBABLY', 'due', 'controversial', 'nature', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'LONG', 'running', 'radio', 'series', 'main', 'African-American', 'characters', 'were', 'played', 'White', 'actors', 'Freeman', 'Gosden', 'Charles', 'Correll', 'who', 'produced', 'TV', 'episodes', 'so', 'think', 'official', 'studio', 'release', 'remastered', 'master', 'tapes', 'FILM', 'HIGHLY', 'unlikely', 'crying', 'shame', 'episodes', 'are', 'HILARIOUS', 'black', 'actors', 'who', 'portrayed', 'characters', 'TV', 'fit', 'roles', 'PERFECTLY', 'are', 'ALL', 'talented', 'VERY', 'funny', 'short', 'recording', 'Disc', '1', 'where', 'TV', 'actors', 'were', 'introduced', 'IN', 'CHARACTER', 'Correll', 'Gosden', 'live', 'studio', 'audience', 'first', 'episode', 'filmed', 'how', 'amazing', 'casting', 'was', 'series', 'Again', 'quality', 'pretty', 'standard', 'series', 'THIS', 'old', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'transferred', 'studio', 'master', 'material', 'People', 'who', 'complain', 'are', 'being', 'UNREALISTIC', 'expectations', 'are', 'LUCKY', 'someone', 'there', 'preserved', 'wonderful', 'comedy', 'available', 'quite', 'reasonable', 'price', 'might', 'add', 'are', 'mediaphile', 'insist', 'watch', 'be', 'High', 'Definition', 'then', 'collection', 'NOT', 'going', 'satisfy', 'Again', 'unrealistic', 'expectation', 'One', 'other', 'favorite', 'series', 'early', 'days', 'television', 'Honeymooners', 'WAS', 'released', 'officially', 'DVD', 'studio', 'even', 'THOSE', 'episodes', 'are', 'not', 'highest', 'resolution', 'sharpest', 'quality', 'o.k', 'when', 'remember', 'are', 'watching', 'shows', 'were', 'televised', 'not', 'long', 'end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'OF', 'COURSE', 'wish', 'too', 'quality', 'was', 'higher', 'am', 'THRILLED', 'have', 'collection', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'anytime', 'want', 'return', 'Brooklyn', 'watch', 'exploits', 'adventures', 'favorite', 'Mystic', 'Knights', 'Sea', 'Lodge', 'HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'product', 'who', 'loved', 'series', 'can', 'appreciate', 'rarity', 'comic', 'genius']",The Amos and Andy TV Show
