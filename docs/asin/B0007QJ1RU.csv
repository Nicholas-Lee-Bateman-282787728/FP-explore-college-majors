887369,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B0007QJ1RU,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[8, 11]","Bedtime for Bonzo is one of Ronald Reagan's best- known films. Originally released in 1951, Regan was only 39 years old when this film was shot. Reagan is the main star of the show, but part of the credit for the film's success also belongs to Bonzo, the chimpanzee that Reagan takes under his wing; adopting him temporarily for a psychology experiment and attempting to teach him the difference between good and bad.Reagan's character in this film is a Psychology professor and the reason he raises Bonzo is to prove a point to the man who would later become his father in law. The man is Dean Tillinghast, and he is an associate professor at the same school. He discovers one day that Reagan's father was a convicted felon and he doesn't want the son of a criminal marrying his daughter because he is afraid the ""bad"" genes have been passed on and that Reagan will end up the same way. Reagan decides to conduct this experiment with Bonzo to prove a point that one's environment is the key to behavioral formation. He and actress Diane Lynn proceed to raise Bonzo and teach him right from wrong.The plot of this film is a little bit cheesy and some of it is very far- fetched. Even if the experiment succeeds, why would a fellow professor accept the behavior pattern of a chimp as proof that it also applies to humans? Of course, one has to keep in mind that this film is meant to be primarily a comedy, so the director likely made it a little bit unreal on purpose, just to make it funnier.Reagan, Herbert Heyes, and Walter Slezak are all pretty good in their respective roles. They seem at least believable in their personifications of the different characters. But the women in the movie seem a little bit too much like actresses. That is, they seem like people on a stage trying their best to act like normal people but not succeeding very well. They talk a little too fast and respond too quickly to questions, like they are being cued by a director.Overall, this movie is ok, but it isn't very memorable for its story or acting. The main thing that makes this movie memorable is Ronald Reagan himself. Watching the future president of the United States playing surrogate father to a chimp is funny and ironic, and it makes ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" worth a look.",3,Ronald Reagan Raises a Chimp,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,2264,"['Bedtime', 'Bonzo', 'one', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'best-', 'known', 'films', 'Originally', 'released', '1951', 'Regan', 'was', 'only', '39', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Reagan', 'main', 'star', 'show', 'part', 'credit', 'film', 'success', 'also', 'Bonzo', 'chimpanzee', 'Reagan', 'wing', 'adopting', 'temporarily', 'psychology', 'experiment', 'attempting', 'teach', 'difference', 'good', 'bad.Reagan', 'character', 'film', 'Psychology', 'professor', 'reason', 'Bonzo', 'prove', 'point', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'later', 'become', 'father', 'law', 'man', 'Dean', 'Tillinghast', 'associate', 'professor', 'same', 'school', 'one', 'day', 'Reagan', 'father', 'was', 'convicted', 'felon', ""n't"", 'want', 'son', 'criminal', 'marrying', 'daughter', 'afraid', 'bad', 'genes', 'have', 'been', 'passed', 'Reagan', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'same', 'way', 'Reagan', 'conduct', 'experiment', 'Bonzo', 'prove', 'point', 'one', 'environment', 'key', 'behavioral', 'formation', 'actress', 'Diane', 'Lynn', 'proceed', 'raise', 'Bonzo', 'teach', 'right', 'wrong.The', 'plot', 'film', 'little', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'very', 'far-', 'fetched', 'Even', 'experiment', 'why', 'would', 'fellow', 'professor', 'behavior', 'pattern', 'chimp', 'proof', 'also', 'humans', 'course', 'one', 'keep', 'mind', 'film', 'meant', 'be', 'primarily', 'comedy', 'director', 'likely', 'made', 'little', 'bit', 'unreal', 'purpose', 'just', 'make', 'funnier.Reagan', 'Herbert', 'Heyes', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'respective', 'roles', 'seem', 'least', 'believable', 'personifications', 'different', 'characters', 'women', 'movie', 'seem', 'little', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'actresses', 'seem', 'people', 'stage', 'trying', 'best', 'act', 'normal', 'people', 'not', 'succeeding', 'very', 'well', 'talk', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'respond', 'too', 'quickly', 'questions', 'are', 'being', 'cued', 'director.Overall', 'movie', 'ok', ""n't"", 'very', 'memorable', 'story', 'acting', 'main', 'thing', 'movie', 'memorable', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'Watching', 'future', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'playing', 'surrogate', 'father', 'chimp', 'funny', 'ironic', 'Bedtime', 'Bonzo', 'worth', 'look']",N/A

(and most adults seem to fall for its charm as well)The most ridiculous and unfair criticism seems to be ""what's a US president doing in a film with a chimp ?""Well, Ronald Reagan was an actor first...and Bedtime for Bonzo is truly one of his most endearing films. It's an utterly charming tale that makes for great family viewing. It's also one of those movies that they absolutely, positively CAN NOT make anymore. Today's family oriented films come across as so PC and sickly sweet, that they quickly become unwatchable.Bedtime for Bonzo is not only highly watchable, it's extremely entertaining on every level it was intended to be. Reagan is perfect in the lead role, and he is greatly supported by a superb cast, including Diana Lynn and Walter Slezak. Of course, the true star of the film is Bonzo, and I must admit, he was wonderful.If you are looking for a great family film that's  entertaining for all, then I would highly suggest this one. To me, it's much better than practically anything Disney ever put out.

Given the modest aspirations of its creators, it is a wonder that we have been able to relax and enjoy it for more than 60 years. Who would have 'thunk it' all those years ago. In the event some younger viewers may have forgotten, it was releaased at a time when American troops were taking the worst licking from an enemy since the early days when George Washington was desperately involved in trying to keep the Colonies from being completely overrun by the British. Being among the better films which the future President was to make, it has some historical interest as well. After all, no other professional actor has ever been elected President. (As an apolitical aside, we might also note that no other President was an authentic Labor Union Leader and, sadly, he was the only President to have been shot in an assassination plot to have survived-although it was very much touch and go when he was brought to the Hospital.)I should be clear that, while it is also an exhibit in the life and times of a President, the film stands on its own merits. Reagan handles his central role as Professor and ""Poppa"" of the chimpanzee he takes into his home to teach human morality.Diana Lynn is her usual chipper, youthful self as the Chimps ""Momma"" and Walter Slezak, plays well the ""friend"" role he was to repeat in several other films (without having the chance that Broadway gave him to show that he had some of the capacity for song that his father, Leo, had demonstrated as one of the top tenors in the world, especially known for his way with lieder). The rest of the cast included long-time second and third bananas, such as Ed Gargan briefly seen as a policeman.So, if you are looking for an historically interesting film which never takes itself seriously, but nevertheless provides good cheer, this is a good bet for you.",4,Frothy Delight,1331164800,"03 8, 2012",2012,2022,"['am', 'quite', 'certain', 'nobody', 'connected', 'film', 'had', 'remotest', 'notion', 'were', 'involved', 'anything', 'getting', 'laughs', 'good', 'word', 'mouth', 'reports', 'theater', 'audiences', 'Given', 'modest', 'aspirations', 'creators', 'wonder', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'more', '60', 'years', 'Who', 'would', 'have', ""'thunk"", 'years', 'ago', 'event', 'younger', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'forgotten', 'was', 'releaased', 'time', 'when', 'American', 'troops', 'were', 'taking', 'worst', 'licking', 'enemy', 'early', 'days', 'when', 'George', 'Washington', 'was', 'desperately', 'involved', 'trying', 'keep', 'Colonies', 'being', 'completely', 'overrun', 'British', 'Being', 'better', 'films', 'future', 'President', 'was', 'make', 'historical', 'interest', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'professional', 'actor', 'ever', 'been', 'elected', 'President', 'apolitical', 'aside', 'might', 'also', 'note', 'other', 'President', 'was', 'authentic', 'Labor', 'Union', 'Leader', 'sadly', 'was', 'only', 'President', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'assassination', 'plot', 'have', 'survived-although', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'touch', 'go', 'when', 'was', 'brought', 'Hospital', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'also', 'exhibit', 'life', 'times', 'President', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'Reagan', 'central', 'role', 'Professor', 'Poppa', 'chimpanzee', 'home', 'teach', 'human', 'morality.Diana', 'Lynn', 'usual', 'chipper', 'youthful', 'self', 'Chimps', 'Momma', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'well', 'friend', 'role', 'was', 'repeat', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'having', 'chance', 'Broadway', 'gave', 'show', 'had', 'capacity', 'song', 'father', 'Leo', 'had', 'demonstrated', 'one', 'top', 'tenors', 'world', 'especially', 'known', 'way', 'lieder', 'rest', 'cast', 'included', 'long-time', 'second', 'third', 'bananas', 'such', 'Ed', 'Gargan', 'briefly', 'seen', 'policeman.So', 'are', 'looking', 'historically', 'interesting', 'film', 'never', 'seriously', 'nevertheless', 'good', 'cheer', 'good', 'bet']",N/A

Bernabo,"[9, 10]","Political opponents of Ronald Reagan always liked to refer to &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot; as some sort of joke film, but it really is a solid B-movie.  Reagan plays Peter Boyd, a professor of psychology whose father was a thief.  To impress Dean Tillinghast (Herbert Heyes), not to mention the dean's daughter, Valerie (Lucille Barkley), Peter sets out to prove that environment is a more important factor than heredity.  Towards this end he borrows Bonzo from a zoology professor (Walter Slezak) and takes the chimp home to raise him like a human.  Peter even hires a nurse named Jane (Diana Lynn) to become Bonzo's &quot;mother,&quot; and everything proceeds well for a while.  Of course the dean's daughter gets jealous and Bonzo senses things are not going well for his happy home.  Fascinated with pretty jewelry, Bonzo steals a valuable necklace from a store.  Peter is accused of having trained the chimp to steal (heredity wills out as it were) and is jailed.  Fortunately Jane and Bonzo are pretty much smarter than the rest of this crew put together and we have a happy ending.Reagan's performance in this movie is solid, with just the right touch of conviction and exasperation as he deals with the upstaging chimp in scene after scene.  Think about how hard it is to act with a chimp: look what Cheetah did to Johnny Weismueller.  Walter Slezak as Professor Neumann is a great second banana in this film, but Reagan makes &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot; work.  He makes this whole crazy story believable and that is what you need in this type of film.  Just think of all the people over the years who have watched this film to ridicule Reagan and who had to end up admitting this is an entertaining little film that deserves to be remembered no matter what happened to its leading actor (no, I am not talking about the chimp in &quot;Bonzo Goes to College&quot;).",4,A B-Movie classic starring Ronald Reagan as well as Bonzo,991699200,"06 5, 2001",2001,1875,"['Political', 'opponents', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'always', 'liked', 'refer', 'quot', 'Bedtime', 'Bonzo', 'quot', 'sort', 'joke', 'film', 'really', 'solid', 'B-movie', 'Reagan', 'Peter', 'Boyd', 'professor', 'psychology', 'father', 'was', 'thief', 'impress', 'Dean', 'Tillinghast', 'Herbert', 'Heyes', 'not', 'mention', 'dean', 'daughter', 'Valerie', 'Lucille', 'Barkley', 'Peter', 'out', 'prove', 'environment', 'more', 'important', 'factor', 'heredity', 'end', 'Bonzo', 'zoology', 'professor', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'chimp', 'home', 'raise', 'human', 'Peter', 'even', 'nurse', 'named', 'Jane', 'Diana', 'Lynn', 'become', 'Bonzo', 'quot', 'quot', 'everything', 'proceeds', 'well', 'while', 'course', 'dean', 'daughter', 'jealous', 'Bonzo', 'senses', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'well', 'happy', 'home', 'Fascinated', 'pretty', 'jewelry', 'Bonzo', 'valuable', 'necklace', 'store', 'Peter', 'accused', 'having', 'trained', 'chimp', 'steal', 'heredity', 'out', 'were', 'jailed', 'Fortunately', 'Jane', 'Bonzo', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'smarter', 'rest', 'crew', 'put', 'together', 'have', 'happy', 'ending.Reagan', 'performance', 'movie', 'solid', 'just', 'right', 'touch', 'conviction', 'exasperation', 'upstaging', 'chimp', 'scene', 'scene', 'Think', 'how', 'hard', 'act', 'chimp', 'look', 'what', 'Cheetah', 'did', 'Johnny', 'Weismueller', 'Walter', 'Slezak', 'Professor', 'Neumann', 'great', 'second', 'banana', 'film', 'Reagan', 'quot', 'Bedtime', 'Bonzo', 'quot', 'work', 'whole', 'crazy', 'story', 'believable', 'what', 'need', 'type', 'film', 'Just', 'think', 'people', 'years', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'ridicule', 'Reagan', 'who', 'had', 'end', 'up', 'admitting', 'entertaining', 'little', 'film', 'be', 'remembered', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'leading', 'actor', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'chimp', 'quot', 'Bonzo', 'Goes', 'College', 'quot']",N/A
