But if a film is good I don't care if it's the re-telling of a tale I've heard dozens of times.I wish I had passed on this renting this movie. It was plagued with cheesy dialogue, weak performances and directing that was mediocre at best (I'm being nice). It reminded me of a made-for-TV movie - the kind with one or two well known actors that you haven't seen in a while (I'm certainly not referring to Brittany M.) - so you say ""what the heck"" and kill a couple of hours to see if they can still act or you get sucked in enough to stick it out just to see how the story ends. Sometimes you're impressed, and other times you really wish you had changed the channel before curiosity got the better of you.I hate to sound so critical because I like Brittany Murphy, which is why I watched this to begin with. I've seen decent performances by some of her costars in the past, but they didn't stand a chance in this train wreck. I don't feel like I wasted an hour and a half of my life because I've suffered through films so painful to watch that it is was a huge relief when the credits finally started to roll. But then again, it's going to be hard not to rank this movie into that category based solely on the fact that it was painful to see Brittany Murphy in such an obvious state of bad health. She was barely a shadow of her former self, and I think it's a shame that her last performance made that so plainly obvious.",2,Not a fitting tribute,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1534,"['basic', 'concept', 'crazy', 'not', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'new', 'been', 'theme', 'many', 'stories', 'film', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 're-telling', 'tale', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'dozens', 'times.I', 'wish', 'had', 'passed', 'renting', 'movie', 'was', 'plagued', 'cheesy', 'dialogue', 'weak', 'performances', 'directing', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', ""'m"", 'being', 'nice', 'reminded', 'made-for-TV', 'movie', 'kind', 'one', 'two', 'well', 'known', 'actors', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', ""'m"", 'certainly', 'not', 'referring', 'Brittany', 'M.', 'say', 'what', 'heck', 'kill', 'couple', 'hours', 'see', 'can', 'still', 'act', 'get', 'sucked', 'enough', 'stick', 'out', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'Sometimes', ""'re"", 'impressed', 'other', 'times', 'really', 'wish', 'had', 'changed', 'channel', 'curiosity', 'got', 'better', 'you.I', 'hate', 'sound', 'so', 'critical', 'like', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'why', 'watched', 'begin', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'decent', 'performances', 'costars', 'past', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'chance', 'train', 'wreck', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasted', 'hour', 'half', 'life', ""'ve"", 'suffered', 'films', 'so', 'painful', 'watch', 'was', 'huge', 'relief', 'when', 'credits', 'finally', 'started', 'roll', 'then', 'again', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'not', 'rank', 'movie', 'category', 'based', 'solely', 'fact', 'was', 'painful', 'see', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'such', 'obvious', 'state', 'bad', 'health', 'was', 'barely', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'think', 'shame', 'last', 'performance', 'made', 'plainly', 'obvious']",N/A

1354314,A1TJRWJ7C7F9MX,B003MI2GHM,dean59,"[2, 3]","This is Brittany Murphy's last movie, as noted, so one might as well start with her performance, which is not precisely convincing (one might expect that a bank would require its higher-ranking employees to confine themselves to one hair color at a time) but is interesting.  Actresses in these Lifetime-ish ""suspense"" dramas typically perform their roles in a way that is characterized by burning faux-intensity and fraudulent righteousness; maybe for reasons personal as much as histrionic, Murphy acts with an edge of fragile uncertainty and a kind of foggy blurriness that is peculiarly and increasingly compelling.  For example, when she is racing in and out of hospital rooms trying to find her missing boyfriend, and her distressed queries are met with poorly-suppressed annoyance and indifference by employees who cannot comprehend her panic and just want to get back to their jobs, Murphy doesn't do the cliche ""I want answers and I want them now!"" that we've come to expect; instead, she wobbles hesitantly, timidly tries again, then shrinks embarrassedly at a fresh rebuff. In other words, behaves more as someone actually would in such a situation, and is the more touching for it.Dean Cain is also good as her boyfriend, and handles both sides of his, shall we say, ""equivocal""--ambivalent?--role with equal believability.Of course, pretty much all detective-mystery-suspense movies have plot holes, whether they are made well, or, as here, not.  But in a good movie they are incidental and forgivable; in ""Abandoned"", it almost seems as if the ambition were to see if a movie could be made entirely out of plot holes strung together with an occasional connective tissue of almost-believability. I will give only two examples, but be assured they do not constitute a lonely pair; first, I find it unlikely that the villain would not only carry around a book that describes his intended crime in fine detail, but make it fully accessible to his planned victim, and in fact even encourage her (unsuccessfully!) to read it--BEFORE he carries out his evil scheme. Secondly, although the scheme itself is perfectly reasonable, it is breathtaking to realize--at the moment one does--that its whole execution, as carried out in such a public and populated place as a medical center, and overlarded as it is with a pretend love affair, a mysterious disappearance that (deliberately?!) gets the whole hospital in an uproar involving the police, and then a fake kidnapping, etc etc, all to coerce someone into doing something, is not only horribly risky, but stupefyingly unnecessary. The bad guys could have skipped all of that complicatedly painstaking nonsense if they'd just gone to her house and put a gun to her head.",2,How many holes make a plot?,1308873600,"06 24, 2011",2011,2726,"['Brittany', 'Murphy', 'last', 'movie', 'noted', 'one', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'performance', 'not', 'precisely', 'convincing', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'bank', 'would', 'require', 'higher-ranking', 'employees', 'confine', 'one', 'hair', 'color', 'time', 'interesting', 'Actresses', 'Lifetime-ish', 'suspense', 'dramas', 'typically', 'perform', 'roles', 'way', 'characterized', 'burning', 'faux-intensity', 'fraudulent', 'righteousness', 'maybe', 'reasons', 'personal', 'as', 'much', 'histrionic', 'Murphy', 'edge', 'fragile', 'uncertainty', 'kind', 'foggy', 'blurriness', 'peculiarly', 'increasingly', 'compelling', 'example', 'when', 'racing', 'hospital', 'rooms', 'trying', 'find', 'missing', 'boyfriend', 'distressed', 'queries', 'are', 'met', 'poorly-suppressed', 'annoyance', 'indifference', 'employees', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'comprehend', 'panic', 'just', 'want', 'get', 'back', 'jobs', 'Murphy', ""n't"", 'do', 'cliche', 'want', 'answers', 'want', 'now', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'instead', 'hesitantly', 'timidly', 'again', 'then', 'embarrassedly', 'fresh', 'rebuff', 'other', 'words', 'more', 'someone', 'actually', 'would', 'such', 'situation', 'more', 'touching', 'it.Dean', 'Cain', 'also', 'good', 'boyfriend', 'sides', 'shall', 'say', 'equivocal', 'ambivalent', 'role', 'equal', 'believability.Of', 'course', 'pretty', 'much', 'detective-mystery-suspense', 'movies', 'have', 'plot', 'holes', 'are', 'made', 'well', 'here', 'not', 'good', 'movie', 'are', 'incidental', 'forgivable', 'Abandoned', 'almost', 'ambition', 'were', 'see', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'entirely', 'plot', 'holes', 'strung', 'together', 'occasional', 'connective', 'tissue', 'almost-believability', 'will', 'give', 'only', 'two', 'examples', 'be', 'assured', 'do', 'not', 'constitute', 'lonely', 'pair', 'first', 'find', 'unlikely', 'villain', 'would', 'not', 'only', 'carry', 'around', 'book', 'intended', 'crime', 'fine', 'detail', 'make', 'fully', 'accessible', 'planned', 'victim', 'fact', 'even', 'encourage', 'unsuccessfully', 'read', 'out', 'evil', 'scheme', 'Secondly', 'scheme', 'perfectly', 'reasonable', 'breathtaking', 'realize', 'moment', 'one', 'whole', 'execution', 'carried', 'such', 'public', 'populated', 'place', 'medical', 'center', 'overlarded', 'pretend', 'love', 'affair', 'mysterious', 'disappearance', 'deliberately', 'whole', 'hospital', 'uproar', 'involving', 'police', 'then', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'etc', 'etc', 'coerce', 'someone', 'doing', 'something', 'not', 'only', 'horribly', 'risky', 'stupefyingly', 'unnecessary', 'bad', 'guys', 'could', 'have', 'skipped', 'complicatedly', 'painstaking', 'nonsense', ""'d"", 'just', 'gone', 'house', 'put', 'gun', 'head']",N/A

1354318,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B003MI2GHM,Jason,"[3, 4]","It is disappointing in many ways that Abandoned is Brittany Murphy's farewell performance.  Abandoned is not necessarily a bad movie, but at best it's a derivative bore.  It's Flightplan without the plane or Jodie Foster, which is unfortunate for Murphy, because it is only compounded by her gaunt, glazed over appearance.  What she didn't need for her legacy is a cinema coup de grace, in which she exudes the symptoms of her actual mortality.The premise of Abandoned has Murphy starring as a bank executive named Mary who is checking her new boyfriend, Kevin (Dean Cain), into the hospital for a routine procedure.  Some time later she can't find Kevin, but is initially reassured by a man named Cooper (Tim Thomerson) who is waiting on his wife.  Eventually hospital administrators and psychologists become involved with Mary, whose apprehension quickly turns to apoplexy - causing suspicion into her sanity - when it becomes apparent to Mary there is more to her boyfriend's disappearance.Overall, the mystery is not sufficient enough to hold attention, the recycled plot not original enough draw interest. The supporting actors are all negligible, and do little more than draw additional attention to Murphy's emaciated impersonation of an unbelievable banking professional.

1354322,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B003MI2GHM,Mark Turner,"[20, 26]","When a celebrity passes away it seems we focus on the good that the person did while on Earth and not the bad. A noble thought and one that should be so, but when the case in point is an actor, we then have to deal with the work they left behind, the final films that were yet to be released. Such is the case with ABANDONED and actress Brittany Murphy who was found dead last year. Already completed, the film has just been released on DVD with little or no promotion. Perhaps that's for the best as the film offers nothing new to the thriller genre and a performance that seems phoned in rather than well done by the late Ms. Murphy.Murphy stars as Mary, a young bank executive on the way to the hospital with her new boyfriend Kevin (Dean Cain) who is due for orthopedic surgery. The hospital is in the process of closing and moving to a new location, but this outpatient surgery shouldn't take more than an hour or so. At least that's what the nurse who takes Kevin's forms tells Mary as she heads to the lounge to wait.While waiting she meets a nice older man named Cooper (Tim Thomerson) and they talk about his wife and her chemo as well as the hospital. He gives her a few words of reassurance and moves on. After a few hours, Mary heads upstairs concerned that she hasn't had word on Kevin. To her surprise, the nurses on that floor inform her that there according to the computers Kevin is not a patient in the hospital.After doing a search of the facility on her own while observed by security, Mary is directed to the head of the hospital Mrs. Markham (Mimi Rogers) who gets security to run the tapes of the cameras throughout the hospital for Mary. The only inkling of Kevin walking in is a shoulder shot that could or could not be him. When a police detective named Franklin (Jay Pickett) is called on the scene, they find that Mary is on anti-depressants and suddenly we're left to wonder if perhaps Kevin was imaginary or not.Taken to be interviewed by the hospital psychiatrist on staff, Dr. Bensley (Peter Bogdanovich), he diagnoses her as mental and in need of observation. But Mary is certain that she's not losing her mind. She knows that Kevin is real. But if so, who is behind his disappearance and why? Is the entire staff of the hospital involved in some major conspiracy or is Mary just not quite all there?Yes, this sort of story has been done before and better to boot. Rather than offer effective pacing that holds your interest, this movie crawls along at a snails pace and never offers the clues needed to make it an effective mystery. Instead it tries to build up the idea that Mary could be mad, but never does so convincingly or with enough support to make the viewer think that that is the case. We've seen this before, we know she can't be!Murphy offers little to make this movie believable as well. Her performance seems one note, as if she were walking through it in a daze. The character would have come off better had she not seemed so out of it from the first scene until the last. And her appearance seems more like that of a groupie on the strip than a banking executive, making her even more unbelievable.I would talk about Dean Cain here but why bother?

I also rented this movie because I've always been a BIG fan of the late Brittany Murphy. I also admire Mimi Rogers even though she's not to much in the limelight but I have always liked her. In her few movies, she can act. First off, I did enjoy the plot of the movie and at times it left me thinking on what was going to happen next. It does play some psychological tricks on you.The acting with some of the unknown actors was a bit cheesy and not to believable. Overall I give it 3 stars. Right before the movie ended, it was dedicated: In memory of Brittany Murphy. I shed some tears. Even though I gave this movie 3 stars, I am going to purchase it because I LOVE B. Murphy. Sadly this was her last film. She was such a talented, beautiful woman who left us to early! I know it will be a year soon since her passing but I am still shocked!

1354333,A3R4XIOYH1OOPV,B003MI2GHM,"Stephanie C ""Stephanie""","[4, 5]","Ok so I read the reviews and thought this was going to be a pretty bad and disappointing movie. I ordered it anyway since it was Brittany Murphy's last film she made before passing away. From the beginning to the end, I could not believe that what I was watching was the same movie I read such disappointing reviews about.I read it was predictable. No it's not. Of course it has it's ""AHA"" moments later on. And sure you might decide someone's a shady character or something's off about them from the beginning, but you still don't know why. That's true and should be true in every movie. That's how things are put together as to why everything we've seen to that point has happened. That's much different than being predictable. Brittany's acting was perfect for the role and character she was playing. People have said it's not the Brittany we've seen in other movies. Acting depends on what the movie's about and the person becoming that character for the situation at hand. She does that perfectly.I read so many ppl focusing on her clothing.. such as since she's a business woman, she sure isn't dressed like one which takes away from her character. I don't know about you, but when I have a day off, you're going to see me dressed very casually. She's not playing a woman at work so why would she be dressed for it. It's kinda like seeing some helpless woman running around in the woods with some crazy man chasing her while she has heels on. That's laughable because it doesn't fit. Her character in a business outfit wouldn't fit because the business part of her life is what she does.. it's not a reflection of the character she's playing in this particular situation.With all that said, the premise of the movie is boyfriend and girlfriend Mary (Murphy) and Kevin (Dean Cain). He has a torn ACL and is going in for routine surgery at the hospital. The nurse says it will only take about an hour. Mary waits for a few hours and still no word from anyone. She goes to the nurses station to get some info, only to find out his name isn't in the system, the nurse who was there before surgery is a nurse nobody has heard of, the Dr. doing the surgery is on vacation, and that particular floor didn't have any patients.She does what any girlftiend would do and tries to find the answers to where Kevin is... yet the evidence seems to suggest he doesn't even exist. That's where it all begins. To say more would be giving away the whole story which many ppl do for some reason; I don't.This was a very well done movie with many twists and turns of trying to put the pieces of this strange puzzle together. Murphy is great as Mary, and shouldn't be compared to other movies she's been in since this isn't those movies. Base your opinion on THIS movie alone, THIS situation, THIS character, and then make your decision on whether it was a good movie or not. You can't take a comedy role and a very dramatic role and say the drama wasn't good because it wasn't as good as the comedy. You can't even take movies of the same genre because they're completely different movies.If I was asked if this was my favorite Brittany Murphy movie, the answer would be no.

Mary is certain Kevin is there for surgery - she had surely arrived there with him - but there is no record of him and no hospital staff remembers Kevin or anything about him. Mary becomes increasingly frantic, but who can she really trust?It's a familiar situation frequently used in suspense films since the days of Hitchcock, and one recent example is the 2005 ""Flightplan,"" where a desperate heroine attempts to find her beloved one while no one really listens to her. Like the Jodie Foster thriller the story begins with promisingly, then gets incredibly contrived and out of control in the end. Yes, hospital is a nice choice for the story's background, but when the film is over, we realize that ""Abandoned"" is only a reheated story told much better somewhere else.""Abandoned"" suffers from unimaginative narrative, so many plot holes and uninspired acting from some of the cast, both making us care less and less about the heroine and what is going on around her.
