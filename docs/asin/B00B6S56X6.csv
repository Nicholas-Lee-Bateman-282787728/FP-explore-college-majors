Joining him are some diverse musicians like Gerry O'Connor (banjo & fiddle), Mats Wester (nyckelharpa & mandola), Arlan Schierbaum (harmonium, accordion, piano & glockenspiel) and Lenny Castro (percussion).  This concert reminded me of Bruce Springsteen's journey into folk music with ""The Sessions Band.""Bonamassa tone things down and as the title suggests, discards the big power amps.  As usual he glides his way through 9 or 10 guitars including some vintage ones.  Many of the songs are his own including the well-received ""Driving towards the Daylight.""  At the same he finds some other songs by Tom Waits, Robert Johnson, Paul Rodgers and others work for this set.  Interspersed during some of the song transitions are brief comments by the band members.  While they are short enough not to interfere with the pace they are somewhat distracting.  Not a big deal.The audio quality is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is excellent as you might expect.  There is also a lossless 2.0 stereo mix.  An excellent 1080p transfer works well with the low stage lighting.  The direction is very good with plenty of focus on the players and their nimble fingers at work.
