1666393,AO4X5NB7KBTN3,B00E96AYYS,Bick Benedict,"[6, 8]","Although I am glad that Silk Stalkings has now been released in its entirety, the amount of time it has taken for this to happen is simply deplorable.  This particular set, too, was delayed three weeks (it was slated for release on October 1 but then Mill Creek Entertainment changed the date to October 22 for unspecified reasons--I even asked them the reason for the delay but received no response).  Obviously, three weeks isn't a remarkable delay, but to me, it brought to mind all of the past delays this series has experienced and reinforced in me, the consumer, the issues (be it missing footage, erroneously printed episode lists on the product insert, or besmudged episode prints) the DVDs usually have as well as the inattention they usually receive (such as not a single extra feature from season 3 forward).Does anyone else remember when Anchor Bay Entertainment released Season 1 of this show?  I do.  It was in 2004--that was nearly a decade ago.  Anchor Bay released seasons 2, 3, 4, and 5 at fairly rapid intervals (2005 for seasons 2 & 3, and 2006 for seasons 4 & 5), but after that, the studio stopped releasing seasons.After four years of nothing, Mill Creek Entertainment bought the right to release seasons, but what Mill Creek chose to do was bewildering: instead of releasing the final three seasons, as one would logically expect, Mill Creek chose to instead re-release Season 1.  Then, after that, it did something even more bizarre: it released a ""Best of Season 1"" which contained only 4 episodes.  Why do this?  Why re-release a season we already had, and then release another set with four episodes that had been released two times before?These redundant season 1 releases occurred in 2009.  Four years later, Mill Creek announced that it was releasing the final three seasons.  But when it made this announcement, the company planned to call the final three season releases ""The Ryan and St. Johns Cases"".  Take note of what I wrote: ""St. JOHNS.""  Mill Creek knew so little about the show that it thought the surname of Janet Gunn's character was ""St. Johns."" It's actually not; her name is Cassandra/Cassy St. JOHN.  Could this have been a typo?  Possibly, but even if it was, they still had the title grammatically wrong in regard to the rules of joint possession and contextually wrong in regard to what her name was on the show.  I actually had to contact Mill Creek on FaceBook and tell them of its mistake; they said they were sorry for the oversight and told me the error would be corrected, which it was.  So in effect, I changed history.  So maybe I was the cause of the three week delay--but even so, they had ample time to make the correction of her name and really, is it my fault if they make typos, or don't know the character's correct fictional name, or lack the knowledge of joint possession?Here is my FaceBook message to Mill Creek dated July 13, 2013: ""You guys do realize that ""The Ryan and St. Johns Cases"" is grammatically and contextually incorrect? Her name is ""Cassandra (also Cassy) St. John"" in the show. You have her name in the plural case, which is wrong in the sense that her name doesn't have an ""s"" at the end of it. Furthermore, if you're trying to establish that the title is joint possession (as it is), you don't even have an apostrophe at the end of her name. Just a heads-up. I'm excited and will buy it; but being an English major the error is blatant to me and makes your company seem as though it (1) does not know basic rules of grammar and (2) does not know important details about a show it is representing. Lastly, please don't misconstrue what I have said; I mention the foregoing not to disrespect Mill Creek Entertainment but rather to help and support a company from whom I enjoy patronizing. I'm extremely excited to have this set of seasons. Silk Stalkings is a great show and deserves to be seen and enjoyed by all.""Here is Mill Creek's response dated July 15, 2013: ""Thank you for bringing this to our attention. It was an oversight on our part and we promise to update it before the release. Thanks and have a great rest of the day!""Now let's examine the item in question.  The discs come in a large DVD case; the three seasons are divided into a total of 12 discs.  Each disc is contained in a black DVD sleeve.  The episode titles are conveniently written on the disc and each of the three seasons are a different color to differentiate them.  The DVDs have all the content on them from the show.  All the episodes are selectable from a list in the menu, though when you select an episode, the episode plays immediately instead of having another menu with different time phases of the episode to select from.  I prefer the latter method; Anchor Bay did it in this manner, and it's disappointing that Mill Creek didn't follow the way Anchor bay used to do it.The quality of the episodes is pretty good.  The Season 6 episodes are a little poorer in quality than the final two seasons' quality, but I shouldn't say that the former episodes are unwatchable.  It's average quality I suppose; however, the Season 6 and 7 episodes look very nice--much better than just streaming them off of the Internet.  The nice thing about having the episodes on disc form is that you can ""scan"" them--rewind, fast forward, that is--but on the Internet, not only is there buffering, but you cannot scan at all.  There are no closed captions on these discs which is pretty unacceptable considering the older seasons had them.  But Mill Creek is about ""value entertainment,"" and when you sacrifice quality for value, you obviously save money but you get poorer quality as a result.  That's a shame: personally, I'd rather pay a little more for higher quality prints with closed captions.Other than that, it's a fairly good package, but based on past releases, I wasn't expecting any extra features or immaculate picture quality.  The bottom line is that while all of the Silk Stalkings releases have been fairly average, the show did not nearly receive the kind of care and attention it deserved.  But with that said, at least we now have all of the episodes on DVD form, even if it did take nine years for this to happen.",4,"An Overview of the Releases, and Seasons 6-8 Review",1382400000,"10 22,
