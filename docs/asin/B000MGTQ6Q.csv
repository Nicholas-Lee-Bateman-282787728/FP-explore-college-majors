The writing, however, is terrible to the point of being painful - honestly, I could swear that with each consecutive episode, the show was trying harder and harder to be taken off the air. Jokes on the show went from cerebral to nonsensical; characters' personalities got a complete remodel, and one can only wonder why a character like 'Johnny Johnson' was even introduced, much less brought back as Lisa's jailbird husband.Having watched the show again from beginning to end, we decided to stop at disc 3. It's probably best, since I half-expect the episodes to turn into some sort of a Married.. With Children spinoff.

1046545,A3B2NVTP78WHUE,B000MGTQ6Q,Jeffrey Rickel,"[7, 7]","Much has been sad about the fifth and final season of Newsradio.  At the time I think Phil Hartman's tragic death may have overshadowed the season and caused people to look down upon Jon Lovitz as he attempted to fill Hartman's large shoes.  Of course Hartman could never be replaced and the Newsradio writers did not try to.  They just let Lovitz be Lovitz and it worked.In retrospect, season five is quite good.  It had been a while since I last saw the season when I purchased this set.  I actually now believe that it might be Newsradio's second best season behind #3, though time might change my opinion.  I've seen the others more recently and may be more weary of them.  Still, season 5 has the very funny DB Cooper storyline and several other hilarious episodes.  ""Freaky Friday"" is actually one of my favorite Newsradio eps as Stephen Root really shines in his pursuit of Matthew.If you can get over Hartman's absence Newsradio Season 5 is excellent.  Every season of Newsradio is excellent.  Buy them all and be sure not to neglect this final season.  It's a shame that we never got to see how the staff of WNYX did in New Hampshire because the producers have said that season 6 would have taken place there.  Too bad.

If you know anything at all about office politics, plus have an understanding of the reality that nobody that has became a billionaire by being friendly, honest, or generous; then those will help you appreciate the comedy behind NewsRadio.

Lovitz is a very funny man but probably was not the best fit for this show.  He doesn't really have a full character other than just being ""Jon Lovitz"".  Is that the writers' fault, Lovitz' fault, or both?Is is at funny as previous seasons?  No.  But many of the faults with Season 5 have nothing to do with Lovitz, so we can't place all the blame on him.  As with most sitcoms, there are going to be some seasons that are better than the others.  Season 5 of ""NewsRadio"" featured some new writers and producers, and they don't really do much worse than the original writers did in the early years.As with any long-running sitcom, not every episode is a classic, and not every season is the show's best.  It just happens that Season 5 of ""NewsRadio"" happened to be the show's last.  Even at its worst it was far better than many of the shows that DIDN'T get cancelled at the end of that year, and shows usually get renewals based on profitability and ratings, not quality.  And we already know that even during its best seasons ""NewsRadio"" was never a ratings juggernaut.  So again, we probably shouldn't blame the show's demise on Lovitz or a sub-par (but still very funny) season.Had ""Frasier"" been cancelled after its 8th or 9th season, seasons generally regarded as the weakest of the series, we might not look back so fondly on it.  Or we might remember it for having gone out with a whimper.  It had a chance to rebound and ended on a high note.  The powers-that-be killed ""NewsRadio"", not the writers and not Lovitz.I was initially reluctant to buy Season 5 because for a long time I'd allowed myself to believe that the entire season was unfunny because Lovitz stepped in to fill the void Hartman left.  Eventually I got over that and bought the DVDs.Glad I did.  The show is still funny in Season 5.  And bringing in Patrick Warburton or Tiffany-Amber Thiessen to see if it could add an extra spark to the show is no more egregious a crime than when countless other sitcoms did any one of a number of things late in the show's run -- ""Mad About You"" and ""Family Ties"" added a baby, ""The Brady Bunch"" introduced Oliver, ""Moonlighting"" saw Maddie and David hook up, ""Cheers"" diffused the sexual tension between Sam and Diane by allowing them to hook up, ""Happy Days"" introduced a slew of new characters and got really saccharine and boring, etc etc etc etc etc.""NewsRadio"" tried something new and it didn't always work perfectly.

But the cast of Newsradio is so good that it takes a lot more than a guy like Jon Lovitz to ruin it.  I usually like Jon Lovitz, but he is horrible in this show.  There are only a couple of duds in the fifth season, but that is expected.  Not every single episode can be great.  The scripts are still strong and Andy Dick (Matthew) and Stephen Root (Jimmy James) are given more to do because of Phil Hartman's unfortunate death.  They both perform brilliantly every episode and so does the rest of the cast.  And Patrick Warburton really livens up te show playing Johnny Johnson, a rival of Jimmy James.  Its a shame he is only in about 6 episodes.  While season 5 is not quite as good as the previous 4 seasons, I still have to give it the full 5 stars.

Burgos ""J.D.""","[16, 18]","In this 5th and what is the somewhat dismal final season of NewsRadio, The season premiere deals with the death of Phil Hartman who died on May 24, 1998 at his Hollywood, CA home in a murder suicide. The season premiere deals with his reflections on his life as well as what he did for the series. The replacement, Max Louis Jon Lovitz, who played as Fred and Mike Johnson in seasons 3 and 4 takes over the duties as newsman. there were some great episodes standout I might say, ""Flowers for Matthew"",Max: Well then, Do you forgive me?Beth: Not a chance in hell you LOSER!Lisa: So how did that go?Max: That's OK, Beth doesn't usually stay mad for long so...Beth: I HATE YOU AND I HOPE YOU GET RUN OVER BY A BUS!The other episode that was good this last year was Freaky Friday where Matthew and Mr. James switch places for a day and he gets in trouble causing Mr. James to go bankrupt. Bt otherwise, the seasons episodes were so-so at best which included Johnny Johnson, D.B. Cooper (Adam West from Batman). The episodes were really dumbed down from past seasons and that's why it probably lead to the shows premature cancellation on May 4th, 1999.

On the plus side, the kick-off episode is an ensemble classic -- one of the best the show ever did -- that would have made the late Phil Hartman proud. (Thanks to the ingenious writing by creator Simms, Bill is a palpable presence.) Andy Dick comes into his own with ""smart"" and ""punk"" characters. And Patrick Warburton is an ingenious addition who steals his every scene.At the same time, it's not what it was. Lovitz was simply miscast -- he could not fill Hartman's shoes, but was assigned a part where he had to do so for the show to thrive -- and would have been better placed initially in Khandi Alexander's peripheral role than Hartman's pivotal one.Moreover, the level of ingenuity the drove the show in seasons past simply isn't in evidence here. There are too many episodes with weak anchors (""Stinkbutt"" is an obvious example), too many gags with faint pay-offs and, while brilliant bits do surface -- for instance, the whole Dave sub-plot in ""Noise"" and Dave fleeing a weeping Beth in ""Ploy"" -- too few opportunities for this talented cast to shine.And yet, for all that, the exit episode is nicely wrought.

Obviously, the loss of Phil Hartman was a big reason for that, but the show could've survived without him and S5 gets off to a good start. The farewell to Bill/Phil found the right mix of humor and sentiment. It was hilarious while still getting you choked up. The following ep was also a treat, with Joe's Year 2000 mishaps(he claims to have a birth certificate with Jesus' real birthdate).NEWSRADIO was always weird, but S5 crossed over into the realm of ridiculous and absurd. Jimmy's irrational fear of hippies leading to Joe hypnotizing him; Matthew turning 30 and going punk; redecorating the men's room; Jimmy's imposter security expert; the ""Freaky Friday"" parody; everyone nonsensically moving to New Hampshire; Lisa's wedding to homeless Johnny(ugh!); and the 3-part D.B. Cooper saga...this was either the ""Jump the Shark"" moment, or it was the ramp and the actual jump was Johnny Johnson returning to marry Lisa. The whole story was crazy, and lazy when you consider how it's resolved(it's like the writer's got tired and used the first insane thing that came to mind), but it also suffered from too much Johnny Johnson and the story went on too long(since when does this show need a 3-parter?).Johnny Johnson wasn't a bad character so much as he was overdone...unlike Andrea the efficiency expert and Jimmy's nephew Walt, who were around for multiple episodes but weren't featured too much. Also, the first 2 parts exemplified the way almost everyone was written out-of-character...these aren't the same characters that made the show so great.Jon Lovitz wasn't a good choice to replace Phil Hartman because Lovitz can't act...he just does his ""Jon Lovitz"" schtick, which is fine for 1 or 2 eps but begins to grate on you. And it doesn't help that Max Lewis is too much like Matthew, and in some cases even weirder.Other things...Beth stops dressing like The Gap and The Salvation Army had teamed up to create a clothing line, and that's disappointing; there are TWO different ""b**ch-slapping"" jokes; a litle too much self-awareness on the part of the characters; Tiffany Amber-Thiessen isn't funny; the cinematography is different, with the episodes looking dimmer/darker(although I think this was an NBC thing); and maybe it's just me but there are times where the actors seem ineffectual or exasperated, almost like they realize just how absurd the material is.Of course there's a lot to like, even eps like ""Towers"" and ""Freaky Friday"" that are excessively weird and contrived but have plenty of laughs and tons of energy, but this isn't the same NEWSRADIO as seasons 1-4. I'm sure I'll buy it someday to complete the collection, but it just doesn't seem worth it right now.",3,The Previous Seasons Were Too Good...,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,2807,"['S5', 'NEWSRADIO', 'still', 'better', 'most', 'sitcoms', 'well', 'short', 'standard', 'set', 'previous', 'seasons', 'Obviously', 'loss', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'was', 'big', 'reason', 'show', 'could', ""'ve"", 'survived', 'S5', 'off', 'good', 'start', 'farewell', 'Bill/Phil', 'found', 'right', 'mix', 'humor', 'sentiment', 'was', 'hilarious', 'still', 'getting', 'choked', 'up', 'following', 'ep', 'was', 'also', 'treat', 'Joe', 'Year', '2000', 'mishaps', 'have', 'birth', 'certificate', 'Jesus', 'real', 'birthdate', '.NEWSRADIO', 'was', 'always', 'weird', 'S5', 'crossed', 'over', 'realm', 'ridiculous', 'absurd', 'Jimmy', 'irrational', 'fear', 'hippies', 'leading', 'Joe', 'hypnotizing', 'Matthew', 'turning', '30', 'going', 'punk', 'redecorating', 'men', 'room', 'Jimmy', 'imposter', 'security', 'expert', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'parody', 'everyone', 'nonsensically', 'moving', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Lisa', 'wedding', 'homeless', 'Johnny', '3-part', 'D.B', 'Cooper', 'saga', 'was', 'Jump', 'Shark', 'moment', 'was', 'ramp', 'actual', 'jump', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Johnson', 'returning', 'marry', 'Lisa', 'whole', 'story', 'was', 'crazy', 'lazy', 'when', 'consider', 'how', 'resolved', 'writer', 'got', 'tired', 'used', 'first', 'insane', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'also', 'suffered', 'too', 'much', 'Johnny', 'Johnson', 'story', 'went', 'too', 'long', 'when', 'show', 'need', '3-parter', '.Johnny', 'Johnson', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'character', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'overdone', 'Andrea', 'efficiency', 'expert', 'Jimmy', 'nephew', 'Walt', 'who', 'were', 'around', 'multiple', 'episodes', 'were', ""n't"", 'featured', 'too', 'much', 'Also', 'first', '2', 'parts', 'exemplified', 'way', 'almost', 'everyone', 'was', 'written', 'out-of-character', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'characters', 'made', 'show', 'so', 'great.Jon', 'Lovitz', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', 'choice', 'replace', 'Phil', 'Hartman', 'Lovitz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'just', 'Jon', 'Lovitz', 'schtick', 'fine', '1', '2', 'eps', 'grate', ""n't"", 'help', 'Max', 'Lewis', 'too', 'much', 'Matthew', 'cases', 'even', 'weirder.Other', 'things', 'Beth', 'dressing', 'Gap', 'Salvation', 'Army', 'had', 'teamed', 'up', 'create', 'clothing', 'line', 'disappointing', 'are', 'TWO', 'different', 'b**ch-slapping', 'jokes', 'litle', 'too', 'much', 'self-awareness', 'part', 'characters', 'Tiffany', 'Amber-Thiessen', ""n't"", 'funny', 'cinematography', 'different', 'episodes', 'looking', 'dimmer/darker', 'think', 'was', 'NBC', 'thing', 'maybe', 'just', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'actors', 'seem', 'ineffectual', 'exasperated', 'almost', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'absurd', 'material', 'is.Of', 'course', 'lot', 'like', 'even', 'Towers', 'Freaky', 'Friday', 'are', 'excessively', 'weird', 'contrived', 'have', 'plenty', 'laughs', 'tons', 'energy', ""n't"", 'same', 'NEWSRADIO', 'seasons', '1-4', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'someday', 'complete', 'collection', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'right', 'now']",NewsRadio: Season 5

It's really great and I'm happy I've got all 5 seasons now.In regards to special features, this doesn't disappoint, though I would've enjoyed a featurette remembering Phil Hartman and a retrospective from cast members, but oh well, we can't have everything. What is here is good. The gag reel is about 20 minutes long and pretty funny, as ones before have been. There are 8 episode commentaries (3 on Disc 1, 1 on Disc 2, and 4 on Disc 3), and two One Man Newsradios. I haven't seen those or the commentaries, but they usually have been good. Hopefully the One Man Newsradios are good; the one on S3 was good, but S4 was not that good.While it is not completely the big bang I'd have liked them to go out on, in regards to the DVDs, but it is still pretty good.
