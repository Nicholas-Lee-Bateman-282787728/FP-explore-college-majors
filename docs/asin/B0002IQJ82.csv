It's best if you watch all of them in order so you can tell the story.  They are good stories because they show some of what life would have been back then. the history of the time.,5,Gambler series,1367971200,"05 8, 2013",2013,283,"['like', 'watching', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'movies', 'have', 'watched', 'Gambler', 'series', 'love', 'westerns', 'best', 'watch', 'order', 'can', 'tell', 'story', 'are', 'good', 'stories', 'show', 'what', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'back', 'then', 'history', 'time']",N/A

835846,A1ZH9LWMX5UCFJ,B0002IQJ82,"K. Stuckey ""kateling""","[5, 6]","Five movies (and counting...) based on a song? This chapter focuses more on the bad deeds of the 'Wild Bunch' (as in Butch and Sundance) in the Wild West. Kenny Rogers has a very personal interest in the gang's activity which is not brought to light until near the end. Loni Anderson plays a madam at a house that includes Mariska Hargitay as one of the girls who also helps the Wild Bunch on their heists because the Pinkertons never expect a lady to be involved. Dixie Carter makes a brief appearance as a popular singer. There are a couple of good laughs and the story rolls right along, there is a heist on a train and a hanging. I do not usually like westerns, but I liked this movie (and got it in a Wal-mart bargain bin for less than half of Amazon's price).",4,Good bang for your buck,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,765,"['Five', 'movies', 'counting', 'based', 'song', 'chapter', 'more', 'bad', 'deeds', ""'Wild"", 'Bunch', 'Butch', 'Sundance', 'Wild', 'West', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'very', 'personal', 'interest', 'gang', 'activity', 'not', 'brought', 'light', 'end', 'Loni', 'Anderson', 'madam', 'house', 'Mariska', 'Hargitay', 'one', 'girls', 'who', 'also', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'heists', 'Pinkertons', 'never', 'expect', 'lady', 'be', 'involved', 'Dixie', 'Carter', 'brief', 'appearance', 'popular', 'singer', 'are', 'couple', 'good', 'laughs', 'story', 'rolls', 'right', 'along', 'heist', 'train', 'hanging', 'do', 'not', 'usually', 'westerns', 'liked', 'movie', 'got', 'Wal-mart', 'bargain', 'bin', 'less', 'half', 'Amazon', 'price']",N/A
