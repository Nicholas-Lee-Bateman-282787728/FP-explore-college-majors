Not only was there just one message, there were at LEAST 10 more; some subtle and other not so subtle.  Besides the obvious and EXCEPTIONALLY good acting from veteran actresses Angela Bassett, Lauretta Devine other other cast members were mediocre.  For some reason I kept seeing Nia Long in Paula Patton's role.  Eddie Griffin would've made a better leading actor!!!!  I almost forgot to mention the POOR AUDIO QUALITY.  I couldn't believe how much dialogue I couldn't understand.  I thought initially that my TV speakers were malfunctioning and that it may have been the DVD...nope it is the lack of microphones or quality microphones used during filming.  So if you've seen previous TD Jakes' films, then you'll know what I'm talking about.  There just so many cliche's in this film...you've seen it before; or perhaps you've lived through it.

1373168,A1XI5UAJE5Z6KN,B003Y5H58S,bordersj2,"[4, 5]","I've seen this movie before... it was a film released not too long ago called ""Our Wedding"", which featured America Ferreira, Forest Whitaker and Carlos Mencia among others.  The cast actually was pretty good, but the film itself was a little poor.  Though that one tried to deal more with ethnic twists (one of Latin background, the other of African-American), the premise and in some ways even flow and scenes of the movie felt eerily similar.  ""Jumping the Broom"", produced by Tracey Edmunds, ex-wife of Babyface.  She has had some fair movies in the past and this one is another that was 'ok'.  Not good, not bad, just ok (to me).The premise has been talked about already, and I can't really review this without giving away spoilers.  So be warned!  Ok then - what I did like about the movie was that there was an occasional twist to it.  Especially with the aunt.  And I also liked the way they handled Tasha Smith's character.  I was also pleasantly surprised by Mike Epps role in the movie though at some times became a bit much - not for the lechery but preachiness.  To put it another way, though the film dealt with different African-American families from different ranges in social status, they did not make the individuals from the 'poorer' end particularly ignorant.  Granted, they just couldn't quite get away from having SOME of that there in the movie but overall I think it was handled well.  Now... what I did not like, is easier to talk about.  Paula Patton really over-acting the part on this one and the person that said she seemed un-realistic, to me, hit the nail on the head.  From the voice to even the shock news in the end, it seemed a bit far-reaching.  The movie couldn't get away from the tendency to preach in just about every African-American movie where there is always this big moment, usually too late, where the main character has had enough.  There also seemed to be some rather serious issues in the end of the movie that would have needed to have been discussed, so you are left with a seemingly incomplete product.  That or Paula Patton's character really was that big of a push-over.  And really in regards to the characters, not many of them were likeable at all from the bridesmaids (the one they forcefully had falling for the chef) to the groomsmen - other than the person that Laz's character chose to be his best man.  Funny but by not having that many lines and making the most of what he did have and actually standing for something; more than even Jason in my view.All in all, I probably wouldn't recommend to buy this movie but renting it is ok.  Seeing it once was probably enough for me.  I didn't even get into Loretta Devine's character or Angela Bassett's, who were every bit as predictable as advertised - one a little bitter, another a little disgusted, both un-necessary.  But without conflict I suppose there really isn't a compelling story.  I guess what is most frustrating is that there was quality here and good actors but perhaps not the best directing.  There was real opportunity for some special moments in the movie, like having the bridesmaid fall for the chef, Jason's cousin putting to rest some of his demons & perhaps even being inspired for more out of his own life.  Or what about noticing a bit more that Jason's uncle really was a good hearted individual - doing more to highlight some of these positives.  Oh, and how about going deeper into Claudine's background which I was honestly a little interesteed about.  I am not saying that the movie had to be a 'feel good' story or Inspirational uplifting saga.  Just that there was a missed opportunity to give it and the actors a chance to provide the characters more depth.  Which makes me think that perhaps the movie wasn't thought out as much as it should've been and ironically suffered from a kind of identity crisis of it's own.  The funniest moment though to me, was that in the end (SPOILER), you wonder what the heck was the big deal about jumping over a broom... if it was that important, just do it.  lol",3,Where Have I Seen this Before?,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,4044,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'was', 'film', 'released', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'called', 'Wedding', 'featured', 'America', 'Ferreira', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'Carlos', 'Mencia', 'others', 'cast', 'actually', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'poor', 'one', 'tried', 'deal', 'more', 'ethnic', 'twists', 'one', 'Latin', 'background', 'other', 'African-American', 'premise', 'ways', 'even', 'flow', 'scenes', 'movie', 'felt', 'eerily', 'similar', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'produced', 'Tracey', 'Edmunds', 'ex-wife', 'Babyface', 'had', 'fair', 'movies', 'past', 'one', 'was', 'Not', 'good', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'ok', '.The', 'premise', 'been', 'talked', 'already', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'review', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'So', 'be', 'warned', 'Ok', 'then', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'was', 'occasional', 'twist', 'Especially', 'aunt', 'also', 'liked', 'way', 'handled', 'Tasha', 'Smith', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'role', 'movie', 'times', 'became', 'bit', 'much', 'not', 'lechery', 'preachiness', 'put', 'way', 'film', 'dealt', 'different', 'African-American', 'families', 'different', 'ranges', 'social', 'status', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'individuals', ""'poorer"", 'end', 'particularly', 'ignorant', 'Granted', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'get', 'away', 'having', 'SOME', 'movie', 'overall', 'think', 'was', 'handled', 'well', 'Now', 'what', 'did', 'not', 'easier', 'talk', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'really', 'over-acting', 'part', 'one', 'person', 'said', 'seemed', 'un-realistic', 'hit', 'nail', 'head', 'voice', 'even', 'shock', 'news', 'end', 'seemed', 'bit', 'far-reaching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'tendency', 'preach', 'just', 'African-American', 'movie', 'where', 'always', 'big', 'moment', 'usually', 'too', 'late', 'where', 'main', 'character', 'had', 'enough', 'also', 'seemed', 'be', 'rather', 'serious', 'issues', 'end', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'needed', 'have', 'been', 'discussed', 'are', 'left', 'seemingly', 'incomplete', 'product', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'character', 'really', 'was', 'big', 'push-over', 'really', 'regards', 'characters', 'not', 'many', 'were', 'likeable', 'bridesmaids', 'one', 'forcefully', 'had', 'falling', 'chef', 'groomsmen', 'other', 'person', 'Laz', 'character', 'chose', 'be', 'best', 'man', 'Funny', 'not', 'having', 'many', 'lines', 'making', 'most', 'what', 'did', 'have', 'actually', 'standing', 'something', 'more', 'even', 'Jason', 'view.All', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buy', 'movie', 'renting', 'ok', 'Seeing', 'once', 'was', 'probably', 'enough', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'character', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'who', 'were', 'bit', 'as', 'predictable', 'advertised', 'one', 'little', 'bitter', 'little', 'disgusted', 'un-necessary', 'conflict', 'suppose', 'really', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'story', 'guess', 'what', 'most', 'frustrating', 'was', 'quality', 'here', 'good', 'actors', 'perhaps', 'not', 'best', 'directing', 'was', 'real', 'opportunity', 'special', 'moments', 'movie', 'having', 'bridesmaid', 'fall', 'chef', 'Jason', 'cousin', 'putting', 'rest', 'demons', 'perhaps', 'even', 'being', 'inspired', 'more', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'what', 'noticing', 'bit', 'more', 'Jason', 'uncle', 'really', 'was', 'good', 'hearted', 'individual', 'doing', 'more', 'highlight', 'positives', 'Oh', 'how', 'about', 'going', 'deeper', 'Claudine', 'background', 'was', 'honestly', 'little', 'interesteed', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'movie', 'had', 'be', ""'feel"", 'good', 'story', 'Inspirational', 'uplifting', 'saga', 'Just', 'was', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'give', 'actors', 'chance', 'provide', 'characters', 'more', 'depth', 'Which', 'think', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'thought', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ironically', 'suffered', 'kind', 'identity', 'crisis', 'own', 'funniest', 'moment', 'was', 'end', 'SPOILER', 'wonder', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'big', 'deal', 'jumping', 'broom', 'was', 'important', 'just', 'do', 'lol']",N/A

The fact that such a current film contains the subject of waiting until the knot is tied to engage in physical activity is a big plus here, and the cliched storyline still works to optimum effect, like a comedic soap opera.  There are so many subplots going on, you can't help but stay tuned.  How many people have complained about the in-laws or--more to the point with our young couple--outlaws causing trouble with an otherwise happy couple?  They all complain about them getting married after less than 6 months, but I've heard of couples being married until death in real life after only 6 weeks.  It only goes to prove that love isn't a matter of time, but the right combination of people for the ultimate spark.  Cute, vindictive, and funny on many levels, this movie is a must-see for anyone who can relate to family interference on an otherwise content couple.  Angela Bassett shines as the uptight mother who brags about once owning slaves (!), and then comes down off her high horse after learning that the family has lost their wealth.

1373176,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B003Y5H58S,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","A dear co-worker of mine, Julia, went to see ""Jumping the Broom"" in the movies.  As an African-American Julia thought the movie to be a little predictable and cliched.  This intrigued me so I had to judge the film for myself.  I thought it was great.  The first half of the film devotes itself to representatives from both sides the African-American spectrum venting their gripes and misconceptions about one another.  It's in the second half where the film takes hold.  There's a series of cataclysmic events that threaten to scuttle the impending nuptials of Sabrina(Paula Patton) and Jason (Laz Alonso), the respective families, and marriages.  It's here where the characters turn their attention to a higher being for strength and clarity.  To a man (and woman) virtually every character here finds solace in God which I found to be extremely refreshing.  It's not every movie where the characters unashamedly espouse a belief in God.  Virtually every part is astutely cast.  Aside from the bride and groom the film draws gravitas from the work of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine as the mothers of Sabrina and Jason, respectively.  The film, though, is truly anchored by Jason's uncle Willie Earl (Mike Epps) who offers sage advice to the combatants.

1373179,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003Y5H58S,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 1]","From filmmaker Salim Akil (known for directing TV episodes for ""The Game"" and ""Girlfriends"") comes the film ""Jumping the Broom"" written by Elizabeth Hunter (writer for episodes of ""ER"" and ""The Fighting Temptations"") and Arlene Gibbs (producer of ""Traitor"").The film is based on a cultural tradition used in other countries but also was used for American-Americans during a time when slaves were not allowed to have official marriages and so, to practice the union of a couple, in their own unofficial wedding ceremonies, the couple would jump a broom and the broom would be passed down from generation to generation.The film was released in theaters on Mother's Day 2011 and the film which was budgeted at $7 million, earned over $37 million in the box office and now the Blu-ray and DVD release will be available courtesy of Sony Pictures and Home Entertainment on Aug. 2, 2011.VIDEO:""Jumping the Moon"" looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  Presented in 1080p High-Definition (1:78:1), Anastas Michos does a wonderful job of capturing the beauty around Martha's vineyard with its blue skies and earth tones.  Also, good planning for costume design to focus on white clothing, tans and dark blues as the colors do look beautiful against the serene and gorgeous environment.Outdoor scenes are vibrant, but also during indoor scenes, skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and for the most part, I detected no problems with picture quality. This is a gorgeous film and it really increased my appreciation for the film because of its presentation and beauty.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Jumping the Broom"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA, English-Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The lossless audio features crystal clear dialog as well as music.  While, surround channels are mainly used for ambiance and music, its front and center-channel driven  is appropriate for this type of film.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Jumping the Broom"" comes with the following special features:Director and Cast Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by Director Salim Akil, actress Paula Patton and actor Laz Alonso.  Akil gives good in-depth information of various scenes and what he wanted to accomplish and more.You're Invited: Behind-the-Scenes - (23:41) Behind-the-scenes of ""Jumping the Broom"".  Cast talk about various scenes and their characters.Honoring the Tradition of Jumping the Broom - (8:47) The cast and crew talk about the tradition of ""Jumping the Broom"" and also asking the talent if they have ever witnessed one at a wedding before.JUDGMENT CALL:""Jumping the Broom"" is a beautiful film with a good touch of drama and comedy but at the same time, there were other storylines that were incorporated to the overall film that were unnecessary.First the good, I absolutely loved the cinematography by Anastas N. Michos (""Mona Lisa Smile"", ""Man on the Moon"", ""Untraceable"").  From the costume design to how warm the colors were when the family were outdoors at Martha's Vineyard was well-done and in my opinion, helped enhance my enjoyment of the film.As for the performances, as a fan of Angela Bassett including Loretta Devine, it was great to see these two women playing the very different mothers.  Bassett has played the stern but loving mother before and Loretta Devine has had this sassy character that she has played not just on film on television and it works on film.  Paula Patton was absolutely delightful onscreen.  She was able to deliver the naive but sensual character of Sabrina and also helped elevate Laz Alonso's role as Jason Taylor.Another aspect that I absolutely enjoyed about the film was the ""Jumping on the Broom"", while not limited to African American culture, it was good to hear of how this tradition held by African-American families for generations has been integrated to the film.As for the actual story, I did enjoy ""Jumping the Broom"" but it does have its fair share of problems.The screenplay tries to integrate a few side storylines of varying characters for no apparent reason.  Storylines that felt as if they were thrown into the story because of the talent that were featured or to increase the duration of the film.For example, we have DeRay Davis' character of Malcolm who plays the best man and cousin of the groom.  And somehow, they end up getting into a squabble at the wedding and sure, audiences will know the two have friction but the overall execution was not handled well.There is no closure between the problems that Jason and Malcolm as things end up with one of them being slugged and somehow, that storyline is forgotten.  A few seconds of closure featuring an apology could have given closure.Also, the storyline tries to incorporate a forced relationship scene between Sabrina's friend Blythe (played by Megan Good) and the Chef (played by CSI's Gary Dourdan).  The relationship has no purpose in the film and it felt as if the writer was trying to showcase several relationships happening outside of the main couple and their parents.  All it did was take away from the film and served no purpose.And then there is Julie Bowen's (""Modern Family"", ""Ed"", ""Happy Gilmore"") character of Amy, who is pretty much the assistant for Sabrina's mother and who appears as flustered as the family due to the multi-tasking before the wedding day. I guess in some way, it's an interesting juxtaposition of films with a white family have African-American servants, and to have the opposite with a an African-American family with a Caucasian servant.  Bowen does provide some laughs during the film but also some scenes seemed unnecessary as well.So, the film does have its positives and some negatives.  And while a predictable film, it does have the banality of many wedding films that do have a happy ending.  And for a wedding film, I found ""Jumping the Broom"" to be an enjoyable film that shows that there is no perfection when it comes to families, rich or poor and that typically, when it comes to weddings, there has to be some compromise.As for the Blu-ray release, the film is definitely gorgeous on Blu-ray and while the film is pretty much dialogue-driven (and some parts with music), I did enjoy listening to the commentary and also the special feature about the tradition of ""Jumping the Broom"".Overall, if you are looking for a fun, wedding film with a good balance of comedy and drama, definitely give ""Jumping the Broom"" a try!",4,Blu-ray:  Enjoyable from beginning to end.,1323993600,"12 16, 2011",2011,6457,"['filmmaker', 'Salim', 'Akil', 'known', 'directing', 'TV', 'episodes',

""ethnic"") movie comes along which is very well done,shows a slightly different perspective, and is actually presented in a noteworthy style.I would say that about ""Jumping The Broom""...but now, don't get me wrong, there are someof the old familiar cliche's that are present...But overall, the makers of this film founda way to show some intelligence and class at the same time.You'll notice plenty of the usual suspects; black actors, actresses, and comedians,who make the rounds in every one of the aforementioned movies that I've eluded to,but there are a lot of new and fresh faces as well.The storyline is basically a downtown working class boy, who has made it big in the corporate world,meets privileged uptown bourgie girl who has never seen hard times in her life.They fall in love, and overtime, decide that they want to marry.The hijinks ensue when his uncouth, semi-'bama, working class family (always with the loud-mouthed-bad attitude-controlling mother, and the opinionated, sorta funny uncle or father figure, who always speaks inappropriatelyand out of turn, but brings the home-spun wisdom & comic relief!) are placed up against her upperclass,snooty, maybe-two-generations-removed-from-the-hood-themselves-but-try-to-emulate-Martha Stewart-and-The Kennedys-family who act like they smell something that stinks every time HIS family walks by!Bottomline, there are funny moments, unnecesssary moments, poignant moments, and of coursethe moral of the story at the end, which, I must say...added up to a very good viewing experiencefor me overall.

1373188,AE8W6OW6A1M5M,B003Y5H58S,Ibochild,"[4, 10]","Given the dearth of quality films with predominently African American casts, it's easy to praise anything even remotely better than the typical fare. On the other hand, it's also easy to place a huge burden on any film that even attempts to do better.When I first learned about ""Jumping the Broom,"" admittedly, my expectations were very low.  The advertising of the film, especially the poster showing the contrast between the darker-skinned, working class family on one side and the lighter-skinned, affluent family on the other side, seemed to play into familiar stereotypes about black people.  The trailer did little to change that perception. At best, I felt the film would be incrimentally better than some of the low brow comedies of Tyler Perry and the like. Upon the recommendation of others, I reluctantly saw the film.The film opens with a scene involving a very vulnerable Sabrina (played wonderfully by Paula Patton), that soon realizes that her latest romantic encounter is nothing more than the a one night stand. She vows never to give herself so easily.  In short order, there's the obligatory ""meet cute"" scene involving Jason (Laz Alonzso).  Before long, Jason ""pops the question"" and the wedding date is set.At this point, ""Jumping the Broom"" shows promise as a wedding picture with likeable characters that seem real.  Sabrina and Jason are an attractive couple that you really care about. They seem destined to have a wonderful life together.Of course in any wedding picture, things are never so easy and thus, the real drama begins. The families of the bride and groom meet each other for the first time. The mothers of the bride and groom, mix about as well as oil and water.It's at this point that the film starts to slip.  Rather than trust the material to bring out the class and personality conflicts inherent in the story in an organic way, the filmmakers insist on throwing subtlety out of the window. This is most apparent in the performances of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine, who play the mothers of the bride and groom, respectively. They are both way over the top. This is really a shame because both ladies are fine actresses, who deserve more quality roles.To make matters worse, as the drama unfolds, Patton and some of the other cast members seem to also get bit by the ""frenetic acting bug,"" as if this were a second rate sitcom.  It's not surprising that Salim Akil, the director of film, is best known for his work as a director on such sitcoms as ""Girlfriends"" and ""The Game.""On the flip side, some of the men, particularly Brian Stokes Mitchell as the bride's father, and Gary Dourdan as a chef at the wedding, give well modulated performances.Things start to degrade into Tyler Perry territory when a ""shocking revelation"" is revealed late into the second act of the film.  Once again, the filmmakers show a lack of faith in their own material. Rather than allow the plot to unfold in an organic and logical way, they have chosen to rely on gimmicks to liven things up instead.However, to the film's credit, it resists some of the most offensive aspects of films by Tyler Perry and the like.  For example, you see no character in the film butcher the English language the way the Madea character does in Tyler Perry's films.  Also, while both ""Jumping the Broom"" and Tyler Perry's films both represent themselves as promoting Christian ideals, ""Jumping the Broom"" does so in a more honest way.  Despite being flawed characters, the people in ""Jumping the Broom"" are basically decent people, who ultimately mean well.  Whereas in Tyler Perry's films, many of his characters appear morally bankrupt and devoid of humanity, until perhaps some tragic event magically transforms them, such as Taraji P. Henson's character in ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself.""While ""Jumping the Broom"" is no masterpiece, it is still very watchable. At times the film is funny and even has some genuinely touching moments.  It is also more nuanced in its depiction of African American people than many recent black films that have hit the market, especially compared to those by Tyler Perry.  One can only hope, that Akil and the other key creative people involved in ""Jumping the Broom,"" will set their sights a little higher on future projects.",3,"Worthwhile, But Not Outstanding Comedy",1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,4266,"['Given', 'dearth', 'quality', 'films', 'predominently', 'African', 'American', 'casts', 'easy', 'praise', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'better', 'typical', 'fare', 'other', 'hand', 'also', 'easy', 'place', 'huge', 'burden', 'film', 'even', 'do', 'better.When', 'first', 'learned', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'admittedly', 'expectations', 'were', 'very', 'low', 'advertising', 'film', 'especially', 'poster', 'showing', 'contrast', 'darker-skinned', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'one', 'side', 'lighter-skinned', 'affluent', 'family', 'other', 'side', 'seemed', 'play', 'familiar', 'stereotypes', 'black', 'people', 'trailer', 'did', 'little', 'change', 'perception', 'best', 'felt', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'incrimentally', 'better', 'low', 'brow', 'comedies', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'like', 'recommendation', 'others', 'reluctantly', 'saw', 'film.The', 'film', 'scene', 'involving', 'very', 'vulnerable', 'Sabrina', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Paula', 'Patton', 'soon', 'latest', 'romantic', 'encounter', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'never', 'give', 'so', 'easily', 'short', 'order', 'obligatory', 'meet', 'cute', 'scene', 'involving', 'Jason', 'Laz', 'Alonzso', 'long', 'Jason', 'question', 'wedding', 'date', 'set.At', 'point', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'promise', 'wedding', 'picture', 'likeable', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'Sabrina', 'Jason', 'are', 'attractive', 'couple', 'really', 'care', 'seem', 'destined', 'have', 'wonderful', 'life', 'together.Of', 'course', 'wedding', 'picture', 'things', 'are', 'never', 'so', 'easy', 'thus', 'real', 'drama', 'families', 'bride', 'groom', 'meet', 'other', 'first', 'time', 'mothers', 'bride', 'groom', 'mix', 'as', 'well', 'oil', 'water.It', 'point', 'film', 'slip', 'Rather', 'trust', 'material', 'bring', 'out', 'class', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'inherent', 'story', 'organic', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'insist', 'throwing', 'subtlety', 'window', 'most', 'apparent', 'performances', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Loretta', 'Devine', 'who', 'play', 'mothers', 'bride', 'groom', 'respectively', 'are', 'way', 'top', 'really', 'shame', 'ladies', 'are', 'fine', 'actresses', 'who', 'deserve', 'more', 'quality', 'roles.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'drama', 'Patton', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'seem', 'also', 'get', 'bit', 'frenetic', 'acting', 'bug', 'were', 'second', 'rate', 'sitcom', 'not', 'surprising', 'Salim', 'Akil', 'director', 'film', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'director', 'such', 'sitcoms', 'Girlfriends', 'Game', 'flip', 'side', 'men', 'particularly', 'Brian', 'Stokes', 'Mitchell', 'bride', 'father', 'Gary', 'Dourdan', 'chef', 'wedding', 'give', 'well', 'modulated', 'performances.Things', 'start', 'degrade', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'territory', 'when', 'shocking', 'revelation', 'revealed', 'late', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'Once', 'again', 'filmmakers', 'show', 'lack', 'faith', 'own', 'material', 'Rather', 'allow', 'plot', 'unfold', 'organic', 'logical', 'way', 'have', 'chosen', 'rely', 'gimmicks', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'instead.However', 'film', 'credit', 'most', 'offensive', 'aspects', 'films', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'like', 'example', 'see', 'character', 'film', 'English', 'language', 'way', 'Madea', 'character', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'Also', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'represent', 'promoting', 'Christian', 'ideals', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'so', 'more', 'honest', 'way', 'being', 'flawed', 'characters', 'people', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'are', 'basically', 'decent', 'people', 'who', 'ultimately', 'mean', 'well', 'Whereas', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'films', 'many', 'characters', 'appear', 'morally', 'bankrupt', 'devoid', 'humanity', 'perhaps', 'tragic', 'event', 'magically', 'such', 'Taraji', 'P.', 'Henson', 'character', 'Can', 'Do', 'Bad', 'All', 'Myself', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'masterpiece', 'still', 'very', 'watchable', 'times', 'film', 'funny', 'even', 'genuinely', 'touching', 'moments', 'also', 'more', 'nuanced', 'depiction', 'African', 'American', 'people', 'many', 'recent', 'black', 'films', 'have', 'hit', 'market', 'especially', 'compared', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Akil', 'other', 'key', 'creative', 'people', 'involved', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'will', 'set', 'sights', 'little', 'higher', 'future', 'projects']",N/A

1373212,AQR22MPF45M3P,B003Y5H58S,Rachel Ford,"[4, 6]","""Jumping the Broom"" follows the tried and true formula of wedding/family conflict romantic comedies -- two people, one from a rich background, the other from a poor one -- fall in love, and are set to find ""happily ever after""...except that their families hate each other. Have we seen it before? Only a thousand times or so. Can it be funny? Absolutely, if well done.On that score, ""Jumping the Broom"" didn't exactly succeed, but it didn't crash and burn either. Much of this was just too happily-ever-after unrealistic (like the snobby girl who falls for the cook subplot), but it is a romantic comedy, so I didn't expect realism. The worst part of this film was by far the acting. To be fair, some of the cast were quite good -- the lead's ""mother"" and ""father"", for example, were very good in their roles. Others, however, were mediocre at best, and so overshadowed the good performances. The lead and her soon-to-be mother-in-law are examples of the latter: their acting was, initially, quite dreadful, although it did seem to improve considerably as the film progressed. It was very distracting, though, and threw off the mood of the film.The story itself, unrealistic parts aside, was not bad -- predictable and average for this type of film, but not bad. The characters (acting excluded) all seemed more or less real, which helped considerably.All in all, this was a decent film, brought low by less than decent acting. 2.5/5 stars -- not a bad production, even with mediocre actors and actresses",3,Decent film hijacked by poor acting,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,1504,"['Jumping', 'Broom', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'wedding/family', 'conflict', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'two', 'people', 'one', 'rich', 'background', 'other', 'poor', 'one', 'fall', 'love', 'are', 'set', 'find', 'happily', 'ever', 'families', 'hate', 'other', 'Have', 'seen', 'Only', 'thousand', 'times', 'so', 'Can', 'be', 'funny', 'Absolutely', 'well', 'score', 'Jumping', 'Broom', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'succeed', 'did', ""n't"", 'crash', 'burn', 'either', 'Much', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'happily-ever-after', 'unrealistic', 'snobby', 'girl', 'who', 'cook', 'subplot', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'realism', 'worst', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'acting', 'be', 'fair', 'cast', 'were', 'quite', 'good', 'lead', 'mother', 'father', 'example', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'roles', 'Others', 'however', 'were', 'mediocre', 'best', 'so', 'overshadowed', 'good', 'performances', 'lead', 'soon-to-be', 'mother-in-law', 'are', 'examples', 'latter', 'acting', 'was', 'initially', 'quite', 'dreadful', 'did', 'seem', 'improve', 'considerably', 'film', 'progressed', 'was', 'very', 'distracting', 'though', 'threw', 'off', 'mood', 'film.The', 'story', 'unrealistic', 'parts', 'aside', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'predictable', 'average', 'type', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'characters', 'acting', 'excluded', 'seemed', 'more', 'less', 'real', 'helped', 'considerably.All', 'was', 'decent', 'film', 'brought', 'low', 'less', 'decent', 'acting', '2.5/5', 'stars', 'not', 'bad', 'production', 'even', 'mediocre', 'actors', 'actresses']",N/A

I'm always hesitant to listen to commentary when the director is the main speaker because they bring up all this stuff that viewers truly don't care about (ex. tent leaning to the side, boat in the distance, why a certain color was used). But this director just went on and on with these long-winded lectures about culture, skin complexion and relationships. I wanted him to talk about the actual movie, but I felt like I was sitting through a motivational speak, which would've been cool if that was what I was looking for. I liked the playful arguing and friendly flirting between Laz Alonso and Paula Patton though. I did learn a few things like Tasha didn't know how to swim, Mike Epps hurt his leg and like a trooper kept going and Paula Patton's obsession with her breath. These were those funny quirks I wanted to hear about. Oddly enough, Romeo was never acknowledged during the commentary (unless I missed it), but all the other actors were. I wondered why, but every time Romeo came up, the director was back into another lecture. My opinion: Just watch the film without the commentary.Cons: Absolutely none (Edit: 9/7 minus the commentary)!Pros: I loved this movie. From the previews, we already know that two people are getting married, and their families are from two different classes. What I was worried about was the non-elite group would be extra ghetto, stereotypical, loud and obnoxious, basically everything that awful ""Tyler Perry's Madea's Big Happy Family"" was. Instead we got an intelligent group of blue collar workers with a couple family members who just weren't impressed with the bells and whistles. Yeah, they kept it ""real,"" but it was real in the sense that it wasn't degrading, and I LOVED that about this film. I'd never seen Loretta Devine play a role that wasn't overly nice and motherly in the sweetest way, so it was fascinating to see her as the obnoxious post office worker and mean mother-in-law-to-be. I was equally ecstatic to find out that Tasha Smith would FINALLY not be playing the angry black woman. I was completely thrown off at how Angela Bassett pulled off such a snobbish, catty role. She did really well, even though she seems so chill in real life. Paula Patton continues to progress as an actress, and I loved her in this film. I already knew Laz Alonso and Mike Epps (the latter being ridiculously funny) were going to kill it, and Laz Alonso and Paula Patton had a ginormous amount of onscreen romantic chemistry. Romeo did his thing, and his acting has improved a lot, too. DeRay Davis was funny in the way only DeRay can do, and I liked him and Mike Epps in the same movie together. Neither was trying to out-funny the other, and they both worked well. Mike Epps was actually doing a lot of serious acting in the middle of his jokes, so I give him MAJOR respect for doing it in such a convincing way.I just read that Brian Stokes Mitchell, who played the elite father, was Trevor on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" Although I don't recognize him from that television show, he's so handsome and he did so well in this film. I would love to see him in more stuff, but apparently I've never seen anything he's done outside of that television show. When I first saw him, I was thinking, ""Where did he come from? Please hire him more often."" I almost always like anything Meagan Good is in, and I love everything about Valarie Pettiford. Her personality just bursts on television and in movies.To sum it up, two people are getting married after going out for six months. Paula Patton's character, Sabrina, got a job in China. Laz Alonso's character, Jason, doesn't believe in long distance. They decide to get married but Sabrina's family hasn't met Jason's family. That's where the fun starts!

Paula Patton plays Sabrina Watson who has prayed to God to meet the right man. She gets her sign when she runs into (with her car) Jason Taylor (Laz Alonso). After dating for 5 months they opt to get married. Sabrina's family is wealthy and act like ""white people."" They frown on black culture. Jason's mom works for the post office and takes anger management classes. When the families get together for the first time for the wedding, there is a clash of personalities and cultures as Jason's mom (Loretta Devine) reminds the bride's family they are still black. The phrase ""jumping the broom"" was new to me. It is what black people traditionally do at weddings, dating back to the time of slavery. Since slaves were not allowed to marry, they would perform their own marriage ceremony by jumping the broom.By having the bride's family be black also, the film could do more with the cultural clash and get away with it than if it was a black-white wedding. For instance, the groom's family wants to do the Electric Slide, a nearly time-honored tradition at black weddings. The bride's family rejects the idea to wit the groom's family responds, ""So I suppose you are going to do the River Dance?"" This would never work with a black-white wedding, but works remarkably well with two black families, judging from the roar from the audience.Oh yes. And the happy wedding couple have not yet consummated their relationship and everyone knows it and thinks it is odd. And the bride's family has a few secrets. The low point was when Jason's mom plays the trump card. The movie shifts from funny to awkward.No swearing. No sex. No nudity (bra/panties).

The standout performance comes from Paula Patton. I was very pleasently surprised to find that she's more than just a pretty face. She's actually a really good actress and comedian. The rest of the film and acting, with the exception of Loretta Devine (and Mike Epps)is pretty average.Laz Alonso, who plays the fiance had one touching scene where he has a candid talk with his mother. Otherwise his performance for the most part was wooden and one dimensional. Same with Angela Bassett, who plays the uptown mother. With the exception of one scene where she manages to come across as real and vulnerable (which I absolutely loved and would like to see more of from her!) in the arms of her husband, she plays her usual hard-edged self and has no place in a romantic comedy drama. It would also have been good if they'd been given proper french lessons if they were going to speak french. On the plus side- it explores some really neccessary themes about race, social class and family ties. It's about time we had movies like this out there for us.
