(If you are looking for a good set of the complete series of sailor moon ... Get it on sailormoondvds.com! All of the other seasons are exact copy's of the official adv/pioneer region 1 DVDs!) well anyways so this season is fantastic! But... Some of the subtitles are off. Like sometimes in certain episodes the character will speak and there will be no subtitles. But it shouldn't be an issue because you can kinda get what their saying by the plot of the episode and what the other character says next. My other issue is the video quality. It is like VHS quality. Which I'm not surprised because a. Sailor moon stars was never released in the u.s and b. it's from the 90s and it's a bootleg. But anyways if you want to see this season without sitting on your computer watching it on YouTube (which i don't know if all the episodes are available) I would buy this set or do what i did and get the complete series on sailormoondvds.com trust me it's worth itSincerely,A guy who has been a sailor moon super fan for his whole life",4,Great last season but..,1387929600,"12 25, 2013",2013,1139,"['Okay', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'exact', 'dvd', 'got', 'off', 'sailormoondvds.com', 'exact', 'copy', 'set', 'are', 'looking', 'good', 'set', 'complete', 'series', 'sailor', 'moon', 'Get', 'sailormoondvds.com', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'exact', 'copy', 'official', 'adv/pioneer', 'region', '1', 'DVDs', 'well', 'so', 'season', 'fantastic', 'subtitles', 'are', 'off', 'sometimes', 'certain', 'character', 'will', 'speak', 'will', 'be', 'subtitles', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'issue', 'can', 'kinda', 'get', 'what', 'saying', 'plot', 'episode', 'what', 'other', 'character', 'next', 'other', 'issue', 'video', 'quality', 'VHS', 'quality', 'Which', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'Sailor', 'moon', 'stars', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'u.s', 'b.', '90s', 'bootleg', 'want', 'see', 'season', 'sitting', 'computer', 'watching', 'YouTube', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'episodes', 'are', 'available', 'would', 'buy', 'set', 'do', 'what', 'i', 'did', 'get', 'complete', 'series', 'sailormoondvds.com', 'trust', 'worth', 'itSincerely', 'A', 'guy', 'who', 'been', 'sailor', 'moon', 'super', 'fan', 'whole', 'life']",Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: The Complete Collection

But as of this writing, there has NEVER been an official R1 release of Sailor Stars. This is a BOOTLEG, people, plain and simple. I know what some of you are going to say. ""But I really want to see it, and if they aren't going to release it, then I'll have to buy a bootleg!""To that, I say balderdash. Why pay money for what is basically a stolen property? This is the internet, people! I'm sure you can find another way of getting it that does not involve parting with your hard earned money to support piracy. (While I admit nothing, I will say that I may or may not have seen Stars myself, and if I did do so it may or may not have involved something that rhymes with a bankrupt tree herder, or rather, a poor Ent.)I say support official releases as much as possible. As far as Sailor Moon goes, I have ADV's release of the first two seasons and Pioneer's/Geneon's releases of the second two seasons and the movies. It is in part the lack of support of official releases that is the reason that the domestic anime market is in something of a dire situation. You want to keep having access to anime? Pay for it in a way that supports the industry, not in a way that just lines some bootleger's pockets.That all being said, it is a sad fact is that there are some things out there extremely unlikely to see domestic release, such as Macross: Do You Remember Love? or this very product, Sailor Stars.

1175876,A370Z6I5GBWU44,B001CDFOFA,"M ""Delicious Strawberry""","[3, 3]","My only complaint about Sailormoon Sailor Stars is that Chibi Usa/Minimoon came back... AGAIN. At this point, I was really sick of that little brat, but this season did have some cool characters (Sailor Galaxia, Princess Kakyuu, the Starlights, the Anima-Mates, etc...) so this season was pretty awesome. And it would have been much better without Minimoon, and I would have liked to see Sailor Cosmos make a full appearance, she looked really cool in the manga. Oh well. The only other real complaint was that the enemies' plot is almost exactly the same as it was in previous seasons (in this season, they want Star Seeds.

1175877,A2D0I7M2G43WWP,B001CDFOFA,Mena P.,"[0, 1]","I first started watching Sailor Moon as a child (like many people, it was my gateway into anime.) When I got older and realized there were five seasons, I was ecstatic! That is, until I realized that it had never been dubbed in our country. And so I knew I would have to go to the ""underbelly"" of the anime world, go against my morals, and buy a bootleg.And, despite my initial worries, I was pleasantly surprised!The packaging itself is wonderful, not even my fellow anime loving friends could tell it was a bootleg at first. The only big packagaing tipoff is, in a little section on the back cover that lists character's names, Artemis is misspelled as Aramis.Unlike official anime releases, which give you the scene selection choice of Opening, Part A, Part B, and Ending, this only gives you a very simplistic episode selection with the title cards, which are unforunately in Japanese. So unless you can read the characters, you'll have to do what I did and print an episode list off a fansite, or Wikipedia. You also have to hit the menu button on a couple of the dvds, as they start playing automatically.Another little issue is occasional problems with the subtitles, which is most heavily present in three episodes. Firstly in ""A Farewell and an Encounter! The Destiny of Flowing Stars"", the last episode to feature Nehelenia. The subtitles for the last bit of the episode start playing as the senshi are reforming her, so while she's talking about wanting to start over, you see subtitles underneath talking about her falling asleep. If I hadn't seen these screencapped beforehand, I wouldn't have known what was going on. Secondly in ""A Storm at School! Transfer Students are Idols"", the episode where the football player becomes a Phage. The subtitles are very off, and continually say something about fish, I believe? I haven't rewatched that particular episode lately, so I'm guessing it was a sign in the background. Lastly, in ""Night Between Us! Usagi's Pinch"", the episode where Seiya ends up at Usagi's house, and the night ends up crazy as everyone else shows up as well. There are many parts where people are speaking and there are absolutely no subtitles at all. This is the one that upsets me the most, as I want to know what's going on between the characters. Sometimes, as well, I feel like subtitles don't display all of what a character is saying, as they're speaking at great length while the subtitle is only maybe three sentences long.The biggest problem I had is that one episode went a little jumpy on me, specifically ""The Scream of Dead Souls? Terror of a Monster at Camp"", in which the Three Lights are filming an action movie, and the Phage is Rei's cousin Kengo. It isn't my favorite and it doesn't drive the plot at all anyway; I tend to skip it. But if someone ever wanted to borrow my set, they might want to see it.Overall, this gets an 8/10 for me. One point deducted for subtitle issues, and one for the skipping episode. I'm glad to have finally been able to see Stars, and it's a great season!On a side note, as excited as I am for the 2013 reboot of my beloved BSSM, I wish they would at least release this officially with subtitles in the US, as the original Monster Of The Day format is the Sailor Moon I grew up with. Perhaps a box set for each of the five seasons? Viz Media has apparently just acquired the rights for releasing the show in Germany, so I'm hoping they'll work on an American release as well!",4,Pretty good bootleg.,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",2012,3456,"['first', 'started', 'watching', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'child', 'many', 'people', 'was', 'gateway', 'anime', 'When', 'got', 'older', 'realized', 'were', 'five', 'seasons', 'was', 'ecstatic', 'realized', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'dubbed', 'country', 'so', 'knew', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'underbelly', 'anime', 'world', 'go', 'morals', 'buy', 'bootleg.And', 'initial', 'worries', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'packaging', 'wonderful', 'not', 'even', 'fellow', 'anime', 'loving', 'friends', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'bootleg', 'first', 'only', 'big', 'packagaing', 'tipoff', 'little', 'section', 'back', 'cover', 'character', 'names', 'Artemis', 'misspelled', 'Aramis.Unlike', 'official', 'anime', 'releases', 'give', 'scene', 'selection', 'choice', 'Opening', 'Part', 'A', 'Part', 'B', 'Ending', 'only', 'very', 'simplistic', 'episode', 'selection', 'title', 'cards', 'are', 'unforunately', 'Japanese', 'So', 'can', 'read', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'have', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'print', 'episode', 'list', 'fansite', 'Wikipedia', 'also', 'have', 'hit', 'menu', 'button', 'couple', 'dvds', 'start', 'playing', 'automatically.Another', 'little', 'issue', 'occasional', 'problems', 'subtitles', 'most', 'heavily', 'present', 'three', 'episodes', 'Firstly', 'A', 'Farewell', 'Encounter', 'Destiny', 'Flowing', 'Stars', 'last', 'episode', 'feature', 'Nehelenia', 'subtitles', 'last', 'bit', 'episode', 'start', 'playing', 'senshi', 'are', 'reforming', 'so', 'talking', 'wanting', 'start', 'over', 'see', 'subtitles', 'talking', 'falling', 'asleep', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'screencapped', 'beforehand', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'known', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Secondly', 'Storm', 'School', 'Transfer', 'Students', 'are', 'Idols', 'episode', 'where', 'football', 'player', 'Phage', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'off', 'continually', 'say', 'something', 'fish', 'believe', 'have', ""n't"", 'rewatched', 'particular', 'episode', 'lately', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'was', 'sign', 'background', 'Lastly', 'Night', 'Between', 'Us', 'Usagi', 'Pinch', 'episode', 'where', 'Seiya', 'up', 'Usagi', 'house', 'night', 'up', 'crazy', 'everyone', 'else', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'many', 'parts', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'speaking', 'are', 'absolutely', 'subtitles', 'one', 'most', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'characters', 'Sometimes', 'well', 'feel', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'display', 'what', 'character', 'saying', ""'re"", 'speaking', 'great', 'length', 'subtitle', 'only', 'maybe', 'three', 'sentences', 'long.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'one', 'episode', 'went', 'little', 'jumpy', 'specifically', 'Scream', 'Dead', 'Souls', 'Terror', 'Monster', 'Camp', 'Three', 'Lights', 'are', 'filming', 'action', 'movie', 'Phage', 'Rei', 'cousin', 'Kengo', ""n't"", 'favorite', ""n't"", 'drive', 'plot', 'anyway', 'tend', 'skip', 'someone', 'ever', 'wanted', 'borrow', 'set', 'might', 'want', 'see', 'it.Overall', '8/10', 'One', 'point', 'deducted', 'subtitle', 'issues', 'one', 'skipping', 'episode', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'finally', 'been', 'able', 'see', 'Stars', 'great', 'season', 'side', 'note', 'as', 'excited', 'am', '2013', 'reboot', 'beloved', 'BSSM', 'wish', 'would', 'least', 'release', 'officially', 'subtitles', 'US', 'original', 'Monster', 'Day', 'format', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'grew', 'up', 'Perhaps', 'box', 'set', 'five', 'seasons', 'Viz', 'Media', 'apparently', 'just', 'acquired', 'rights', 'releasing', 'show', 'Germany', ""'m"", 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'work', 'American', 'release', 'as', 'well']",Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: The Complete Collection
1175878,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B001CDFOFA,Patrick Correa,"[3, 3]","This is it, the final season of Sailor Moon.  And I for one don't like it.  Although I feel that the anime greatly improved upon the manga for the first 3 years & some of the fourth, this is where the manga totally blows the anime away.  I know it has its fans, & if you enjoy it that's perfectly fine.  But I'm sorry, I did not.  If you haven't seen it, there are many spoilers ahead.The season begins with the 6 part story arc I like to call Nehellenia's Revenge.  A mysterious benefactor frees Nehellenia from her curse.  She shatters her Dream Mirror and the shards either morph into Nehellenia clones or get in people's eyes, causing them to want to do nothing but look at themselves in mirrors.  The victims include Mamoru.  I have to admit this is a decent arc overall, despite some big flaws.  There are some Les Yay lines between Uranus & Neptune (the worst ones come later on in this season), Mamoru gets taken out easily by a villain he should have finished off, Chibiusa's ""death"" is good but nowhere near as strong as it was in the manga; but the worst part is the ending.  It's revealed Nehellenia only clung to her beauty because she believed that's the only reason anyone liked her, so the Sailor Senshi & Prince Endymion combined all their powers & gave her the chance to relive her life from when she was a child.What.  The.  Heck?!I think even Doctor Who would say this made no sense.  For starters, they forgive a person who committed genocide just to stay beautiful forever?  No, it's worse than genocide because the victims become the living dead & serve her until someone kills them.  And how come they can even do it in the first place?  The Inner Senshi's powers combined can't heal a dying person (like Saphir), but with the Outer Senshi they can rewrite time and space?  And finally, this should really mess up the continuity in one of 2 ways.  What if this back fired, & she prepared herself for the Sailor Senshi & took them out when the time came?  And even if this had worked, how come nothing changed?  If the Dead Moon Circus never came into being, they never would have met Pegasus, so shouldn't-gah, my head hurts!  Suffice to say, this where Sailor Moon basically went off the deep end for me.And the sad thing is it was one of the 2 best parts of the season (we'll get to the other one at the end).  The main part of the season is where the show really went wrong.  A new boy band known as the Three Lights has come to town & with them the evil Shadow Galactica, a group consisting of Sailor Senshi gone bad, and the possibly heroic Sailor Starlights.  The evil Sailor Senshi were all well written villains (one of the very few improvements over the manga at all this season was giving Iron Mouse & Aluminum Siren actual characterizations, though Lead Crow & Tin Nyanko were 2 of the few manga villains with decent personalities that the anime expanded on, but Galaxia was MUCH better in the manga), but the Sailor Starlights are what's really wrong with this season.  First of all I have to admit that aside from what I'll say later, they were given better characterization than in the manga, but the manga versions were cooler.  Why?  In the manga, they were girls who cross dressed as boys but they were wholesome cross dressers.  Seiya only started dating Usagi because she thought she might be their princess.  In the anime, they're males who physically transform into female Sailors.  That was when Naoko Takeuchi, the creator, got really upset with the producers of the anime, & I don't blame her.  She said that only females can be Sailors, which gets no argument from me.  The anime raises way too many awkward questions, especially when Seiya really becomes romantically involved with Usagi.  The vast amount of fanfics pairing these two (often with the pairings Taiki/Ami & Yaten/Minako) just boggles the mind.  Aside from the fact that they're screwing up the timeline & giving poor, awesome Mamoru the shaft, these pairings are so messed up that I'd actually rather read stories where Mamoru marries Rei or even ones where Usagi falls in love with Prince Demando!  And that's sad, because most of the stories for these episodes were good apart from the gender bending issues & some really adult humor (like the one where they have a party at Usagi's house & everyone shows up; it's funny but some parts really made me cringe).  But one of the biggest flaws this season is the fights.  The Sailor Phages are hardly my favorite Monsters of the Week, but they were honestly fairly creative & a good way to extend the show.  But it really ticks me off just how much they downgraded Sailor Moon this season.  It shows in episode 194, during the fight with Sailor Tin Nyanko.  As one Youtube commenter noted, she had absolutely no offensive moves.  Just so you know in the manga, her attack for this season was a killing move.  Why couldn't they have made a different attack for healing people like they did in the first season?And now we come to the finale, which is both the best & worst part of the season.  On its own, it is pretty strong, though the deaths of the Sailor Senshi were not nearly as heartbreaking as their deaths in the first season.  I could have lived without Sailor Moon & Sailor Galaxia getting naked at the end, but apart from that it was quite good (I know it's supposed to show purity & they looked like Barbie dolls but still, that was worse than the transformation sequences if you ask me).  But compared to the manga, it was nothing.  The Sailors were picked off 2 at a time, which really increased the tension.  Then Sailor Moon, Sailor Chibi Chibi, the Sailor Starlights, Princess Kakyuu Sailor Chibi Moon, AND the Amazoness Quartet all go to the end of the universe to face the villains, while in the anime our heroes just go to their local TV station.  And let me just say, the bit where Galaxia reanimates the dead Sailors & Tuxedo Mask always gets me.  Shame on them for not including that scene.  And of course, Galaxia & especially Chaos were much more complex villains in the manga.I know we're supposed to judge each on its own merits, but the producers really botched it up this time.  I'm sorry to say this but the manga wins this time by a country mile.  However, I must admit that no matter what this was still very well produced technically, hence the 2 star rating.  The animation has never been better, the music was still good & the voice acting was excellent as always.  I'm really looking forward to the new Sailor Moon reboot now, especially since Naoko Takeuchi confirmed it would be closer to the manga.  While I don't think I'll enjoy the first 3 arcs as much as the original anime, I'm sure she won't let Toei make the same mistakes they did with the last 2 arcs.  I just hope they can get as many of the original actors back as possible.",2,"Stars is overrated.

1175879,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B001CDFOFA,Paul Jutras,"[2, 2]",At least a chance to own the final season of Sailor Moon and this final season is well worth seeing. The season starts off with the return of the dark moon circus queen from Sailor moon super s wanting revenge of Sailor Moon. The girls are now in High School and Lita finally is in the same uniform as her class mates. Rei goes to another school with a different uniform. The queen begins with infecting Darien (Mamoru) and getting Serena (Usagi) all worried. The new power of the queen is enough to reawaken Sailor Saturn who speaks to the scouts of a sailor war.After the queen is dealt with and peace has restored to the girls lives Mamoru goes off to study in America though with the new Queen Galaxy attack it is unsure if he ever get there. The three lights music group (who is really the sailor stars) show up along with other characters calling themselves sailor soldiers like Sailor Iron Mouse. There are some stuff in this season that are like the events of previous season as other reviewers have noted as well as some interesting differences such as Usagi not being such a cry baby.  I would like to mention that I have always wondered what become of Melvin and Molly characters since the early seasons.There is only a couple of things that causes me to down rate the set. The first is that the disks are stacked atop of each other. I seen it done in double and triple feature sets and never cared for it in fear of the disks getting scratched up.  The other complaint I have is that you have to turn on the subtitles each time you put the disk in.,4,Best we could ask for,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",2011,1560,"['least', 'chance', 'own', 'final', 'season', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'final', 'season', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'season', 'return', 'dark', 'moon', 'circus', 'queen', 'Sailor', 'moon', 'super', 's', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'girls', 'are', 'now', 'High', 'School', 'Lita', 'finally', 'same', 'uniform', 'class', 'mates', 'Rei', 'school', 'different', 'uniform', 'queen', 'infecting', 'Darien', 'Mamoru', 'getting', 'Serena', 'Usagi', 'worried', 'new', 'power', 'queen', 'enough', 'reawaken', 'Sailor', 'Saturn', 'who', 'scouts', 'sailor', 'war.After', 'queen', 'dealt', 'peace', 'restored', 'girls', 'Mamoru', 'study', 'America', 'new', 'Queen', 'Galaxy', 'attack', 'unsure', 'ever', 'get', 'there', 'three', 'lights', 'music', 'group', 'who', 'really', 'sailor', 'stars', 'show', 'up', 'along', 'other', 'characters', 'calling', 'sailor', 'soldiers', 'Sailor', 'Iron', 'Mouse', 'are', 'stuff', 'season', 'are', 'events', 'previous', 'season', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'as', 'well', 'interesting', 'differences', 'such', 'Usagi', 'not', 'being', 'such', 'cry', 'baby', 'would', 'like', 'mention', 'have', 'always', 'wondered', 'what', 'become', 'Melvin', 'Molly', 'characters', 'early', 'seasons.There', 'only', 'couple', 'things', 'down', 'rate', 'set', 'first', 'disks', 'are', 'stacked', 'other', 'seen', 'done', 'double', 'triple', 'feature', 'sets', 'never', 'cared', 'fear', 'disks', 'getting', 'scratched', 'up', 'other', 'complaint', 'have', 'have', 'turn', 'subtitles', 'time', 'put', 'disk']",Sailor Moon Sailor Stars: The Complete Collection
1175880,A2FF11D7REYZMX,B001CDFOFA,"PlanetHell ""EmbraceThatSmothers""","[1, 14]","Is this season really supposed to be better than SuperS. No way, in what world? SuperS was extremely creepy, and had an original story. This season does not; it is in fact mostly the same as Super, except it sucks horribly.There are at least 11 very wrong things with this season.#1. The plot and the ending. A unbelievably powerful Sailor Soldier needs all the star seeds to have destroyed the universe. ""Sailor Galaxia"" is actually Sailor Sun, but has the force of ""Chaos"" inside her. This already happened three times. In Sailor Moon S, Hotaru was actually Sailor Saturn, but the real evil force was ""Mistress 9"" who needed pure heart crystals to be resurrected. Chaos"" is basically a ghost version of the ""Death Phantom"" from Sailor Moon R, or a non-fireball version of Pharaoh 90 from S. .Worse, this season downplays past seasons saying ""this is a galactic war"" while the others were ""insignificant."" Because destroying everyone's dreams, destroying the universe, destroying the future, was apparently a simple matter. In the very end, it literally goes with Sailor Moon naked taking Galaxia's hand. Really. This teaches everyone that if you strip naked, all will be overcome and the world will be saved. Or rather, Toei Animation saved most of the US audience by not dubbing this season, but not those poisoned by attempts to watch it on youtube.#2. Where are the ""Asteroid"" Sailors? Or Sailor Papillion? The ""Asteroid"" Sailors were seen in Sailor Moon Super S, the previous season, as the ""Amazon Quartet,"" four girls stolen from the dream world meant to rest until Rini (sailor moon's daughter) reigns as queen. They were woken up and became enemies, but came over to the good side. Now being awake, the logical step was for them to became sailors, like ""Sailor Ceres"" (the biggest moon besides Earth's moon). Someone's bright idea was to write them out entirely, along with an all-black wearing traitor working with Galaxia named ""Papillion"" from another universe.This is the only one that can be entirely blamed on the anime, not the Manga.#3. The terms ""Pure Heart Crystal"" and ""Star Seed."" Can anyone spot a difference? One comes out of your heart's area, the other from a flower from your head. Both can be corrupted/stolen etc. Um, a flower in your head? A dream mirror to see you dreams is one thing. The star seeds are repetitive, and essentially useless as a weapon. They literally sit in Sailor Galaxia's collection, while finding the golden dream mirror involved grants you the golden crystal which can be used to rule the universe, or pure heart crystals that finding the right one literally involves finding the holy grail/purity chalice. Star seeds could make shiny gifts that you cannot give to your friends because they turn black and get really ugly. They became ""poisoned"" when exposed.#4.  Rini aka Serena/Darien's daughter goes home. The second Darien dies, she would disappear. The future is screwed. This is basically never mentioned. Her absence is quite ridiculous, given the fact that she saved the world in Super S, and was it's main character.#5. So there is basically no Tuxedo mask. No guy entering the vampire disco to save the day, to literally throw spiked roses through monsters and villains, or to unleash cool theme music. And he is not the only main character who leaves.#6. Sailor Moon/Serena gives Darien/Tuxedo Mask the finger after approximately one week of no letters. He goes to America to pursue further learning (why is never told), and is captured and killed by Galaxia, a plane hijacked. Serena dates Sieya, one of the Sailor Transvestites. She could've at least chose Sailor Star Healer, who looks like a young version of Jamie Lee Curtis.#7. The Sailor Starlight's are men normally. Yes, men who literally transform into women. Technically ""Tuxedo Mask"" is ""Sailor Earth"" in a vampire disco outfit, but this is out of control. Transformed or not, at least two of them look like repulsive transvestites. A gross alien from Dragonball Z, Freiza, is far more attractive.#8. The Sailor Starlight's are beyond useless as characters. They are trying to find their ""princess"" (we've heard this before, twice!) but are only concerned with that and killing Sailor Galaxia (oh no; another evil sailor-see #1). Separate from others, they have conflicts of interest. This is less interesting and identical to Sailor Moon S, in which Sailor Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto have a separate mission to do what must be done rather than fighting for ""peace and justice."" It was done far better during the show's arguably best season (Sailor Moon S).#9. Sailor Moon becomes ""Eternal Sailor Moon,"" and actually has wings in this form. But she cannot fly unless Pegasus (from Supers) were to return, so they are just fancy items that limit mobility in combat. But this doesn't matter (see #10). Notably, the season also takes place in the summer. Her outfit is quite thick, yet during winter seasons she never had anything on.#10. ""Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss,"" unlike previous attacks, is nor flashy nor exciting. She basically twirls an oversized moon scepter (like we didn't see Scepter's in R and S). One could go into a coma waiting for this attack to end.#11. Unlike previous seasons, it does not take effort from any other Sailor to beat the enemy, in this season called ""Phages."" One hit from her attack, and they are done, no weakening or efforts to knock them down or hold. In other words, having Sailor Saturn around, one called ""the sovereign of silence,"" or ""the sailor scout of destruction,"" who can destroy all life and start over again, or the load of the stronger sailors from S around, is completely pointless.One positive point: The first six episodes involve Sailor Galaxia unleashing Nelhelenia to get revenge and take out all of the current universe Sailors. Nelhelenia is a jealous, bitter woman who hates their guts. She throws glass at the earth. She rocks. Also, Sailor Saturn returns and strikes with fury, using ""Silence Wall,"" and ""Silence Grave Suprise"" in one of the series best episodes.

1175882,A3ILA0TTNLZMX,B001CDFOFA,whome,"[50, 54]","Sorry-WRONG-this is not an officially sanctioned set-it's what most raving anime fans call a ""bootleg""-but I disagree. Seeing as this particular season never made it to the us it's a viable option for those who don't feel like messing around with fansubs. Here's my take on it-the video is about 3.5 on a scale of 1 to 5-it's gotta be a laserdisc rip, it's soft and blurry-but the color balance is good, this is on 4 dvd9's-problem is they didn't use all 8 gigs of space available on the discs-the sound quality is about 4.2-pretty good-no noticeable hiss or distortion. The subs are excellent-I don't know what fansub script they used-but be aware that there are some missing lines on discs 3 & 4, not enough to seriously deter understanding what's being said-but enough to be irritating. All in all if you want to see Sailor Moon-Sailor Stars this is a very good way to do it. With the gender bending Sailor Starlights and the lesbian pairing of Uranus and Neptune preventing it from ever being licensed for general release here-but it sure would be nice if someone would. I wish Toei would get off their collective high horse and relicense it.
