The biography  on balanchine was very informative and the dancing was very beautiful.  I have seen many performances of ballets corographed by Balanchine and enjoyed being able to watch him dance and work with the dancers.,5,Wonderful Balanchine,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,326,"['exceptional', 'video', 'used', 'class', 'was', 'doing', 'dance', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'biography', 'balanchine', 'was', 'very', 'informative', 'dancing', 'was', 'very', 'beautiful', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'performances', 'ballets', 'corographed', 'Balanchine', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'dance', 'work', 'dancers']",N/A

I had no idea he was so instrumental in bringing ballet to the United States.  My main complaint was that the film was too short.  We found out almost nothing about the dancers Balanchine worked with, and we saw only snippets of the ballets.  I thought it particularly odd that although Suzanne Farrell appeared in dozens of clips, more than any other ballerina, nothing at all was said about her.",4,A good introduction to Balanchine's work,1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,502,"['knew', 'little', 'life', 'work', 'Balanchine', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'documentary', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'so', 'instrumental', 'bringing', 'ballet', 'United', 'States', 'main', 'complaint', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'short', 'found', 'out', 'almost', 'nothing', 'dancers', 'Balanchine', 'worked', 'saw', 'only', 'snippets', 'ballets', 'thought', 'particularly', 'odd', 'Suzanne', 'Farrell', 'appeared', 'dozens', 'clips', 'more', 'other', 'ballerina', 'nothing', 'was', 'said']",N/A

It is as much story about his life as it is story about Balanchine'e relationship with composer Stravinsky who arranged many of the modern pieces Balanchine created.  It is also a story about creation of the two biggest ballet houses in the United States: American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet.In the course of the documentary there are pieces of some of the most memorable works Balanchine created performed by American prima ballerinas who were his muses, wives and treasure of american ballet history.Being that ballet is visual art and in a sense pagan since there is no way to ""memorize"" each movement - one can only improvise on creations of others or create new pieces, this documentary is important document to the legacy of one man's work that created performing art with american tradition.",5,Tribute to Balanchine's work,1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,964,"['documentary', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'who', 'classical', 'modern', 'ballet', 'choreographed', 'master', 'choreographer', 'George', 'Balanchine', 'as', 'much', 'story', 'life', 'story', 'Balanchine', 'e', 'relationship', 'composer', 'Stravinsky', 'who', 'arranged', 'many', 'modern', 'pieces', 'Balanchine', 'created', 'also', 'story', 'creation', 'two', 'biggest', 'ballet', 'houses', 'United', 'States', 'American', 'Ballet', 'Theatre', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Ballet.In', 'course', 'documentary', 'are', 'pieces', 'most', 'memorable', 'works', 'Balanchine', 'created', 'performed', 'American', 'prima', 'ballerinas', 'who', 'were', 'muses', 'wives', 'treasure', 'american', 'ballet', 'history.Being', 'ballet', 'visual', 'art', 'sense', 'pagan', 'way', 'memorize', 'movement', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'improvise', 'creations', 'others', 'create', 'new', 'pieces', 'documentary', 'important', 'document', 'legacy', 'one', 'man', 'work', 'created', 'performing', 'art', 'american', 'tradition']",N/A

The whole documentary was beautifully put together, and the dancing was sublime.  The best thing about it were the moments when he found a new graceful movement for his dancers out of the traditional forms (Serenade was particularly moving).  You have a sense of someone always thinking, always working.  The greatest moment I think was the end of the Prodigal Son, so completely unexpected.  You come away in awe -- no doubt about his genius, none whatsoever.",5,"Excellent, moving",1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,579,"['bought', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'Balanchine', 'end', 'was', 'completely', 'hooked', 'everything', 'did', 'whole', 'documentary', 'was', 'beautifully', 'put', 'together', 'dancing', 'was', 'sublime', 'best', 'thing', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'found', 'new', 'graceful', 'movement', 'dancers', 'traditional', 'forms', 'Serenade', 'was', 'particularly', 'moving', 'have', 'sense', 'someone', 'always', 'thinking', 'always', 'working', 'greatest', 'moment', 'think', 'was', 'end', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'so', 'completely', 'unexpected', 'come', 'away', 'awe', 'doubt', 'genius', 'none', 'whatsoever']",N/A
