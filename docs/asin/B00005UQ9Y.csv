I don't like when Black Sisters are played in a mean and ignorant light.  (Give a brother a nice hello or smile)  I hated that he got her in the end.  There were some scenes I liked, such as when the husband punched the Plenty character (funny) and the arrogance of the Hil Harper character.  Babyface and is wife Tracey, Oh there acting skills were awful.  However I am happy they produced the movie.

I bought the movie on cassette and it was really enjoyable to me when I was going through a time where I have down on my luck and down on love.  The movie for me was good in its light comedy and of the variety of issues that each character had.  I can understand how some people may not like the fact that this is a low budget movie, and some elements of the acting could have been done better.  Yet, the soundtrack was nice and the story is realistic in how some people go about denying their feelings or their flaws.

This is film is ""loosely"" based as a recount of the writer who is the acting lead in the film. His journey makes him very relatable as he attempts an introspection in examing his true feelings for his friend who is the object of his affection. Tracy Edmonds & Kenny ""Babyface"" Edmonds partnered to produce this film. If you like Soul Food then perhaps you'll like this film. Though not a blockbuster commercial success this film has a genuine story with some sentimentality. The lesson is we as men should be strong enough to show and talk about our feelings.
