My husband and I ordered this DVD to see him in stand up comedy and were pleased that it included an interview where he shares his beginning in comedy.  Since then we have read ""Never Stand Next to a Naked Man"" (hiliarious) and have learned even more about his personal life starting life with the last name of ""Dick"" and how his name was shortened to the Tim Allen we know.  Everything Tim Allen does is good for those healthy belly laughs we all need.  We own every one of his DVD's and love seeing them again and again when we need a laugh.  This video is worth seeing at least once.",4,We love Tim Allen - this includes an interview...,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,664,"['had', 'never', 'heard', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'saw', 'reruns', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'husband', 'ordered', 'DVD', 'see', 'stand', 'up', 'comedy', 'were', 'pleased', 'included', 'interview', 'where', 'shares', 'beginning', 'comedy', 'then', 'have', 'read', 'Never', 'Stand', 'Next', 'Naked', 'Man', 'hiliarious', 'have', 'learned', 'even', 'more', 'personal', 'life', 'starting', 'life', 'last', 'name', 'Dick', 'how', 'name', 'was', 'shortened', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'know', 'Everything', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'good', 'healthy', 'belly', 'need', 'own', 'one', 'DVD', 'love', 'seeing', 'again', 'again', 'when', 'need', 'laugh', 'video', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once']",Tim Allen: Live On Stage

I could barely sit through the first performance. It was sooo bad and extremely boring. I couldn't even bring myself to watch the second show.

I can only say I laughed and I admired Tim Allen's strong personality. I mean to stand up in front of such a big mass of people and to talk, confortable with your own self, as if you are telling jokes among friends, this is amazing. Also, the creativity of showing differences between men and women, in ""tool language"", that was cool.
