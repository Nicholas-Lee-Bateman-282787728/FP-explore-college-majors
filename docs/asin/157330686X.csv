Murray,"[389, 415]","According to DVDTalk (see the forums), they have previewed this set and at least some of these episodes have been CUT.The so called ""director's cut"" episodes don't ADD anything... they only remove stuff.  So not only do you not get the videos in with the episodes, you also get censored episodes as well.Some examples from DVDTalk (so far):* 1-900-BEAVIS - On the Time Life disc, when the boys first make the phone call, they laugh and Butthead says ""She said something"" and they continue to laugh. On the Paramount disc, this line is omitted.During the call the lady asks if they're there, and on the Time Life disc Butthead says ""I think I just innoculated"" (which is kinda funny actually). This line is removed in the Director's Cut.Then at the end, the last line in the Time Life version is ""Hey, maybe we'll hear some butt wind."" This is removed from the Director's Cut.* Late Night with Butthead - The new Director's Cut removes the first minute and a half of this episode, starting instead where B&B; pitch the idea for their talk show. It removes Letterman's cameo voice appearance. Later, the director's cut removes B&B; celebrating with some air guitar after successfully pitching their show.So again, the only thing the Director's Cut does is remove stuff.* Figure Drawing - The DC removes a line where their teacher says he's about to teach a class on Aroma Therapy. Three or four lines are then cut after B&B; rearrange the letters on the sign. Several other dialogue cuts throughout. No additions.* Held Back - The DC removes the lines ""This desk is giving me a stiffy"" and ""I don't even have room for a stiffy"".* Tainted Meat - The DC removes a bit from the middle of a news broadcast talking about ""a fierce new parasite"" in regards to Beavis making everyone sick at Burger World.Gives a new meaning to ""Director's Cut"" doesn't it?Note that the first report for the B&B; DVD said that the director's cuts will be ""different from orignal broadcast, but not necessarily longer"".I can kind of understand the copyright issue with including the videos, but not these other edits.Don't buy cut up crap like this.",1,DVD'S ARE CENSORED,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,2122,"['According', 'DVDTalk', 'see', 'forums', 'have', 'previewed', 'set', 'least', 'episodes', 'have', 'been', 'CUT.The', 'so', 'called', 'director', 'cut', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'ADD', 'anything', 'only', 'remove', 'stuff', 'So', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'videos', 'episodes', 'also', 'get', 'censored', 'episodes', 'well.Some', 'examples', 'DVDTalk', 'so', 'far', '*', '1-900-BEAVIS', 'Time', 'Life', 'disc', 'when', 'boys', 'first', 'make', 'phone', 'call', 'laugh', 'Butthead', 'said', 'something', 'continue', 'laugh', 'Paramount', 'disc', 'line', 'omitted.During', 'call', 'lady', ""'re"", 'there', 'Time', 'Life', 'disc', 'Butthead', 'think', 'just', 'innoculated', 'kinda', 'funny', 'actually', 'line', 'removed', 'Director', 'Cut.Then', 'end', 'last', 'line', 'Time', 'Life', 'version', 'Hey', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'hear', 'butt', 'wind', 'removed', 'Director', 'Cut', '*', 'Late', 'Night', 'Butthead', 'new', 'Director', 'Cut', 'first', 'minute', 'half', 'episode', 'starting', 'instead', 'where', 'B', 'B', 'pitch', 'idea', 'talk', 'show', 'Letterman', 'cameo', 'voice', 'appearance', 'Later', 'director', 'cut', 'B', 'B', 'celebrating', 'air', 'guitar', 'successfully', 'pitching', 'show.So', 'again', 'only', 'thing', 'Director', 'Cut', 'remove', 'stuff', '*', 'Figure', 'Drawing', 'DC', 'line', 'where', 'teacher', 'teach', 'class', 'Aroma', 'Therapy', 'Three', 'four', 'lines', 'are', 'then', 'cut', 'B', 'B', 'rearrange', 'letters', 'sign', 'Several', 'other', 'dialogue', 'cuts', 'additions', 'Held', 'Back', 'DC', 'lines', 'desk', 'giving', 'stiffy', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'room', 'stiffy', '*', 'Tainted', 'Meat', 'DC', 'bit', 'middle', 'news', 'broadcast', 'talking', 'fierce', 'new', 'parasite', 'regards', 'Beavis', 'making', 'everyone', 'sick', 'Burger', 'new', 'meaning', 'Director', 'Cut', ""n't"", 'first', 'report', 'B', 'B', 'DVD', 'said', 'director', 'cuts', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'orignal', 'broadcast', 'not', 'necessarily', 'longer', '.I', 'can', 'kind', 'understand', 'copyright', 'issue', 'including', 'videos', 'not', 'other', 'edits.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'cut', 'up', 'crap']",N/A

That's where the stupidest and most hilarious discussions between beavis and butthead take place, not to mention the headbanging and dancing and various other funny stuff.  Maybe it's something to do with the artists not wanting their videos used or some copyright crap, I have no idea, but it's just not the same without it.  I know this has one whole DVD with just bonus features and music videos with commentary, but it's not as good as how the original episodes aired.  The episodes are funny on their own, but I did notice, as others have stated, that some of the episodes are cut and censored.  The one I noticed it on was the ""Manners"" episode.  I knew they cut the very end where B&B are sitting on the crappers and Butthead is saying ""Please come out of my butt"".  That was the funniest part of the whole episode, and they cut it completely out.  I only realized this because I happened to tape the ""moronothon"" about 10 years ago, and that original episode is on there, so I've seen it a million times.  I'm not sure how many other episodes are butchered up like this, and I'm sure someone out there knows the episodes better than I do.  When I heard about this DVD release I was extremely excited because I thought for sure they would be in original form, but they aren't.  Sure it's an ok value for only $24.99, (mine came with a bonus book which was pretty cool) but it would have been more pleasing to have the episodes un-edited with the videos.  On the positive note, the episodes are still really funny, and it's amazing how short they are when you don't have to sit through 20 minutes of commercials.

No complaints here on that.But the pointless, absolutely unjustifiable edits made by Mike Judge himself??  I didn't know about them until after I bought and opened the set. But I surely wouldn't have bought it if I had known in advance.If the early reports are true, Mr. Judge got the message that fans were irate and did not alter the episodes on Volume 2. If true, in a perfect world these discs would be reissued with the episodes in their original uncut forms.I'm not ever going to be ""grateful"" for a subpar release. Along with all the other fans, I'm one of the people responsible for making Mike Judge a rich, succesful man (both B&B; and King of the Hill are pure genious).

188530,A3KMTOFTUUNFHG,157330686X,Brett D. Cullum,"[12, 21]","When Beavis and Butthead ran starting back in 1993 the shows were made up of two shorts and the guys commenting on music videos.  There was a very nasty law suit in that year against MTV and the show over an episode called ""Comedians"".  Two kids burned down a trailer home, and the show came under fire for the delinquent tendencies of the leads.  MTV severely edited the series, and those original cuts were lost.  Also Mike Judge was under EXTREME pressure to crank out 65 episodes a year, as the show aired several times a week.  There were some quality control issues with the animation, and frankly even Judge was not happy with some of the episodes.For them to release a whole season (especially that first one) would be too expensive.  You couldn't get the rights to all the videos they commented on without spending a fortune (the set would cost you hundreds of dollars as a result).  Also many early eps that were edited do not exist in their original form anymore.  So what Mike Judge and MTV did was pick the ones they liked the most from what they had.  There will be 3 volumes.  You get 11 videos with commentary from Beavis and Butthead, and 40 of the shorts.These may not be YOUR personal favorites, but you do get the debut of CORNHOLIO, and several very funny moments like when the two are sent all the way back to kindergarden.  About 23 of the episodes include sequences never before broadcast!  So you get them unedited and in extended forms.  This is a great set!  Don't let the approach fool you.  This is the best way for them to release the show, the most cost effective way, and also the way to insure you get the best of the show.",4,Here's why we don't get the seasons... and why it's Volume One,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,1656,"['When', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'ran', 'starting', 'back', '1993', 'shows', 'were', 'made', 'two', 'shorts', 'guys', 'commenting', 'music', 'videos', 'was', 'very', 'nasty', 'law', 'suit', 'year', 'MTV', 'show', 'episode', 'called', 'Comedians', 'Two', 'kids', 'burned', 'down', 'trailer', 'home', 'show', 'came', 'fire', 'delinquent', 'tendencies', 'leads', 'MTV', 'severely', 'edited', 'series', 'original', 'cuts', 'were', 'lost', 'Also', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'was', 'EXTREME', 'pressure', 'crank', 'out', '65', 'episodes', 'year', 'show', 'aired', 'several', 'times', 'week', 'were', 'quality', 'control', 'issues', 'animation', 'frankly', 'even', 'Judge', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'episodes.For', 'release', 'whole', 'season', 'especially', 'first', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rights', 'videos', 'commented', 'spending', 'fortune', 'set', 'would', 'cost', 'hundreds', 'dollars', 'result', 'Also', 'many', 'early', 'eps', 'were', 'edited', 'do', 'not', 'exist', 'original', 'form', 'anymore', 'what', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'MTV', 'did', 'was', 'pick', 'ones', 'liked', 'most', 'what', 'had', 'will', 'be', '3', 'volumes', 'get', '11', 'videos', 'commentary', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', '40', 'shorts.These', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'YOUR', 'personal', 'favorites', 'do', 'get', 'debut', 'CORNHOLIO', 'several', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'sent', 'way', 'back', 'kindergarden', '23', 'episodes', 'include', 'sequences', 'never', 'broadcast', 'So', 'get', 'unedited', 'extended', 'forms', 'great', 'set', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'approach', 'fool', 'best', 'way', 'release', 'show', 'most', 'cost', 'effective', 'way', 'also', 'way', 'insure', 'get', 'best', 'show']",N/A

Peterson ""I'm not blind drunk, I'm j...","[2, 2]","As I said in my review of volume 3 of the Mike Judge Collection, I am in complete and total agreement with those who feel that Mike should buckle down and release the entire series on DVD and yes, that it could be done leaving the episodes fully intact complete with the videos in their proper place. Though admittedly as I also said I was always more interested in the episodes themselves than the videos, though I did have favorites. That said I don't believe that the Mike Judge collections are the travesty that many reviewers on here seem to believe them to be. In fact I haven't laughed so much or so hard in a very long time.Volume 1 features forty or so episodes and thirteen music videos, the latter of which are always found on disk 3 of each volume. I'll be focusing more on the episodes themselves since as I said those were always what interested me most.As many reviewers pointed out, a great number of the episodes have had material cut from them, and wile in many cases this doesn't bother me there were instances where it was a little disconcerting. Notable such instances occured in Manners SUck and Tainted Meat. In the former, the toilet scene was cut and in the latter the health inspecter's comments about a fierce new parasite. FOrtunately both are available as easter eggs so at least they weren't removed entirely. But I'll list my personal favorites below. I like most if not all episodes in this volume but these are just my personal favorites.No Laughing: After having the duo sent to his office four times in one day, Principal McVicker decides enough is enough and forbids them from laughing in class for a week under threat of expulsion. Unfortunately, Mr. Buzzcut isn't going to make it easy for them...Home Improvement: The duo attempts to help Tom Anderson paint his house, but paint fumes give them...other ideas.Lawn and Garden: The duo is asked to trim a tree on Anderson's property with predictably disastrous results.Blackout!: Forced out into the streets of Highland by a power outage, the boys cause massive chaos when they attempt to direct traffic.Plate Frisbee: While hanging out at Stuart's house, the boys cause trouble on the streets of Highland when they discover that an antique plate belonging to Stuart's mother makes an excellent frisbee while Stuart looks on in horror.Manners Suck: A guest lecturer attempts to teach proper manners to the students of Highland High, though the boys' presence predictably means that the attempt goes badly wrong.VS. the Vending Machine: The boys attempt to overcome a mechanical failure in a vending machine before someone else can steal their snacks.Tainted Meat: Beavis causes a health crisis at BUrger World that costs the duo their jobs and temporarily closes down the restaurant.The Pipe of Doom: While messing around at a construction site, Butthead gets stuck in a pipe and Beavis must figure out a way to save him.Generation inCrisis: An amateur documentary film maker tries to use the duo in a film he is working on that depicts teenagers as lazy couch potatoes.Rabies Scare: After being bitten by a bad-tempered dog, Beavis becomes convinced that he has rabies and is treated by a mean-spirited doctor.Madame Blavatsky: The boys visit a fortune teller in hopes of finding out whether they'll ever score, but it's Beavis who sees all.1900-Beavis: After experimenting with a phone sex hotline, the duo attempt to start one of their own.The Great COrnholio: Too much sugar causes a raddical personality change in Beavis, who transforms into a hyperintense profit of doom.Dream On: Boredom causes the duo to fall asleep while watching TV, which leads to their dreaming of being on classic TV shows.Beaverly Buttbillies: After seeing it on TV, the duo attempts to dig for oil in their backyard with disgusting results.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this collection even though a few small favorite scenes of mine were edited out and not all are available as easter eggs. For me at least the laughs far overshadowed this detail.",4,I like it.,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,4019,"['said', 'review', 'volume', '3', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Collection', 'am', 'complete', 'total', 'agreement', 'who', 'feel', 'Mike', 'should', 'buckle', 'down', 'release', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'yes', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'leaving', 'episodes', 'fully', 'intact', 'complete', 'videos', 'proper', 'place', 'Though', 'admittedly', 'also', 'said', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'interested', 'episodes', 'videos', 'did', 'have', 'favorites', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'collections', 'are', 'travesty', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'seem', 'believe', 'be', 'fact', 'have', ""n't"", 'laughed', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'hard', 'very', 'long', 'time.Volume', '1', 'features', 'forty', 'so', 'episodes', 'thirteen', 'music', 'videos', 'latter', 'are', 'always', 'found', 'disk', '3', 'volume', ""'ll"", 'be', 'focusing', 'more', 'episodes', 'said', 'were', 'always', 'what', 'interested', 'most.As', 'many', 'reviewers', 'pointed', 'out', 'great', 'number', 'episodes', 'have', 'had', 'material', 'cut', 'wile', 'many', 'cases', ""n't"", 'bother', 'were', 'instances', 'where', 'was', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'Notable', 'such', 'instances', 'occured', 'Manners', 'SUck', 'Tainted', 'Meat', 'former', 'toilet', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'latter', 'health', 'inspecter', 'comments', 'fierce', 'new', 'parasite', 'FOrtunately', 'are', 'available', 'easter', 'eggs', 'so', 'least', 'were', ""n't"", 'removed', 'entirely', ""'ll"", 'list', 'personal', 'favorites', 'like', 'most', 'not', 'episodes', 'volume', 'are', 'just', 'personal', 'favorites.No', 'Laughing', 'having', 'duo', 'sent', 'office', 'four', 'times', 'one', 'day', 'Principal', 'McVicker', 'enough', 'enough', 'forbids', 'laughing', 'class', 'week', 'threat', 'expulsion', 'Unfortunately', 'Mr.', 'Buzzcut', ""n't"", 'going', 'make', 'easy', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'duo', 'help', 'Tom', 'Anderson', 'paint', 'house', 'paint', 'fumes', 'give', 'other', 'ideas.Lawn', 'Garden', 'duo', 'asked', 'trim', 'tree', 'Anderson', 'property', 'predictably', 'disastrous', 'results.Blackout', 'Forced', 'out', 'streets', 'Highland', 'power', 'outage', 'boys', 'cause', 'massive', 'chaos', 'when', 'attempt', 'direct', 'traffic.Plate', 'Frisbee', 'hanging', 'out', 'Stuart', 'house', 'boys', 'cause', 'trouble', 'streets', 'Highland', 'when', 'discover', 'antique', 'plate', 'belonging', 'Stuart', 'mother', 'excellent', 'frisbee', 'Stuart', 'horror.Manners', 'Suck', 'guest', 'lecturer', 'attempts', 'teach', 'proper', 'manners', 'students', 'Highland', 'High', 'boys', 'presence', 'predictably', 'attempt', 'badly', 'wrong.VS', 'Vending', 'Machine', 'boys', 'attempt', 'overcome', 'mechanical', 'failure', 'vending', 'machine', 'someone', 'else', 'can', 'steal', 'snacks.Tainted', 'Meat', 'Beavis', 'health', 'crisis', 'BUrger', 'World', 'duo', 'jobs', 'temporarily', 'down', 'restaurant.The', 'Pipe', 'Doom', 'messing', 'around', 'construction', 'site', 'Butthead', 'stuck', 'pipe', 'Beavis', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'save', 'him.Generation', 'inCrisis', 'amateur', 'documentary', 'film', 'maker', 'use', 'duo', 'film', 'working', 'teenagers', 'lazy', 'couch', 'potatoes.Rabies', 'Scare', 'being', 'bitten', 'bad-tempered', 'dog', 'Beavis', 'convinced', 'rabies', 'treated', 'mean-spirited', 'doctor.Madame', 'Blavatsky', 'boys', 'visit', 'fortune', 'teller', 'hopes', 'finding', 'out', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'score', 'Beavis', 'who', 'all.1900-Beavis', 'experimenting', 'phone', 'sex', 'hotline', 'duo', 'attempt', 'start', 'one', 'own.The', 'Great', 'COrnholio', 'Too', 'much', 'sugar', 'raddical', 'personality', 'change', 'Beavis', 'who', 'hyperintense', 'profit', 'doom.Dream', 'Boredom', 'duo', 'fall', 'asleep', 'watching', 'TV', 'dreaming', 'being', 'classic', 'TV', 'shows.Beaverly', 'Buttbillies', 'seeing', 'TV', 'duo', 'attempts', 'dig', 'oil', 'backyard', 'disgusting', 'results.All', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'collection', 'even', 'few', 'small', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'mine', 'were', 'edited', 'out', 'not', 'are', 'available', 'easter', 'eggs', 'least', 'laughs', 'far', 'overshadowed', 'detail']",N/A

But Sony misses the mark big-time with this release. If they plan on releasing more episodes on DVD, can they at least put the show in it's proper form?Here is the biggest complaint: they have completely chopped out the music videos that were such an integral part of the show when it was run on MTV. You know, the clips where a video is playing and the boys give their thoughts, whether they'd be trashing a terrible one or cheering an Iron Maiden video. Gone, completely cut out! The MTV logo is plastered all over the case, but this DVD DOES NOT REPRESENT THE SHOW AS SEEN IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM!!!! I don't know if the videos have been cut out due to licensing restrictions ( as in older seasons of Mystery Science Theater, where the rights to the movies have expired ), but not having Beavis &amp; Butthead making fun of the videos takes away an incredibly funny aspect of the show.On top of that, you get nothing extra for the price. No commentary, no unreleased material, NOTHING!!!!! Despite the fact of containing 7 episodes, the disc doesn't even crack the 45-minute barrier!!!

This didn't bother me too much, since I never picked up the Time/Life DVDs & got a new set for under 20 bucks. However, after getting the set & watching what little is here, I'm still a bit underwhelmed.First, upon inserting the DVD, you're forced to watch advertisements for other DVD sets before you even get the FBI/copyright warning & menu. Then you have only 20 x 2 to 4 minute skits to chose from (DVDs 1 & 2), and while the material is mostly funny, they feel quite a bit shorter than I remember. When I had read that there would be ""director's cuts"" of videos there was no mention that that meant that the skits were actually censored & no new material added. The videos also feel severely cut. There are only 11 & they only include the bits where B&B; are talking, so they are from 30 seconds to about 2 1/2 minutes long.The bonus features include a few promos & a short MTV style documentary by the creators. This too is censored. At one point Mike Judge says the ""s"" word & you hear just enough to know what he says, but they use the bleep anyway. How lame is that for a ""Mature Audiences"" dvd?  The doc also includes bits of ""Frog Baseball"" cartoon that aired in one of the early Spike & Mike festivals, as well as the one where they go to the monster truck show (or was this in Frog Baseball, I don't remember). Why didn't they include these episodes in the set?  On the other hand, they do include the bits of B&B; that aired on MTV's Thanksgiving day special (before the very last episode of Beavis & Butthead), which was very lame (Kurt Loder didn't do a very good job either).  If they included this unfunny material, why not include all of the material in their entirety?I find it hard to believe that with all the money, staff & music industry connections that MTV has, that they couldn't have gotten the rights to the entire videos.  Shout! was able to get the music rights in order to release the entire SCTV series. The only thing they couldn't include wasn't because of any artists that appeared on the show, but was a polka (satire) version of Stairway to Heaven that Led Zeppelin refused to give clearance for.

188538,A1RI3XMZHQXPD2,157330686X,C. Taylor,"[14, 18]","There is not much of a reason to do so. There is no story arch, no character development other than perhaps Beavis channeling Cornholio, and not enough cultural references to date any of the episodes. You could easily air a  season seven episode followed by a third season episode with no problem. It is not like putting M.A.S.H. on DVD where characters were written out when their actors left the series while new ones where written in. Showing an episode with Col. Potter followed by one with Col. Blake would not make much sense.So why should they release Beavis & Butt-head in season box sets? Because that is the only way the buyer can be sure that they will get every episode.Remembering back to the days of VHS and Laserdisc, whenever a series of any kind was released, it was usually done with two episodes a tape/disc. They would usually take the most popular episode of the entire series and pair it with a more obscure episode for the first volume, and keep this up for the next ten to fifteen volumes, pairing popular episodes with obscure. However, once they ran out of the popular episodes they would usually abandon the series. Another problem was movie shorts such as ""Laurel & Hardy"" and ""The Three Stooges"" as well as cartoon's such as the Warner Brothers Cartoons. I don't know how many times the Warner Brothers ""Loony tunes"" cartoons were released in volumes only to be abandoned after a couple of years. Even the Laserdisc collections fell far short of complete.Releasing a series in chronological order guarantees that nothing is skipped. And if for some reason the volumes are abandoned after a few years are released then the series could always be picked up where last left off when there is another round of volumes released. That is something that is not done when the last few volumes were best of compilations.I would like to take the time here to dispense with some myths about the Beavis & Butt-head series on DVD. One is that they do not or cannot have the video commentary segments that were once part of the cartoon because it would be too expensive. This is nonsense. If that were the case then how are secondary DVD labels able to release music video collections? For about $15 you get 15 - 20 full videos. Here MTV is only showing partial videos, and they own the rest of the content. If the record labels were charging full royalties for each video then that would only be about an extra $30 a DVD, and since MTV does not have to pay royalties to themselves to put their own cartoon on DVD then they could easily release a season box at $50. However, more likely the record labels would be willing to give MTV a break and charge 1/4 the royalties as usually the videos were cut off before the chorus or edited short. That would be about $8 extra a season. MTV could easily offset the cost anyway by having the full uncut videos as bonus material on the DVD's.The other myth is that the banned episodes no longer exist or only now exist as edited versions. I really doubt that the MTV executives would be so stupid as to take their master copies of the completed episodes and edit those. Usually the way it works is that after the master copy is completed, copies are dubbed from that to actually air on MTV, thus protecting the master from wearing out from repeated airplay. They would have had several dub copies to edit from. But even if they did edit the finished master and somehow threw out all their copies of the original version, the separate elements would still exist and they could easily reedit a new master from the source material. And I am also sure that the animating company as well as Mike Judge owns their own master copies of the series.Basically what is happening here is this... Some MTV executive with a bug up his ass does not want the episodes that he had banned to reappear on any of their home video releases. Nor does he want to pay for the videos no matter what they cost. As long as people keep buying incomplete versions of the cartoon series those episodes will never be released. But if the DVD tanks and the main reason is that the fans are waiting for a complete season by season release then those episodes will finally be included.Either way, unless this volume just happens to have all the Beavis & Butt-head episodes you give a damn about then I would not bother buying it. Nor would I expect that the later volumes [ if any, are released ] would even come close to completing the series.",1,Do you really need to release Beavis & Butt-head in season box sets?,1131321600,"11 7, 2005",2005,4466,"['not', 'much', 'reason', 'do', 'so', 'story', 'arch', 'character', 'development', 'other', 'perhaps', 'Beavis', 'channeling', 'Cornholio', 'not', 'enough', 'cultural', 'references', 'date', 'episodes', 'could', 'easily', 'air', 'season', 'seven', 'episode', 'followed', 'third', 'season', 'episode', 'problem', 'not', 'putting', 'M.A.S.H', 'DVD', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'written', 'out', 'when', 'actors', 'left', 'series', 'new', 'ones', 'where', 'written', 'Showing', 'episode', 'Col.', 'Potter', 'followed', 'one', 'Col.', 'Blake', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'much', 'sense.So', 'why', 'should', 'release', 'Beavis', 'Butt-head', 'season', 'box', 'sets', 'only', 'way', 'buyer', 'can', 'be', 'sure', 'will', 'get', 'episode.Remembering', 'back', 'days', 'VHS', 'Laserdisc', 'whenever', 'series', 'kind', 'was', 'released', 'was', 'usually', 'done', 'two', 'episodes', 'tape/disc', 'would', 'usually', 'take', 'most', 'popular', 'episode', 'entire', 'series', 'pair', 'more', 'obscure', 'episode', 'first', 'volume', 'keep', 'up', 'next', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'volumes', 'pairing', 'popular', 'episodes', 'obscure', 'However', 'once', 'ran', 'popular', 'episodes', 'would', 'usually', 'abandon', 'series', 'problem', 'was', 'movie', 'shorts', 'such', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'as', 'well', 'cartoon', 'such', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Cartoons', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Loony', 'tunes', 'cartoons', 'were', 'released', 'volumes', 'only', 'be', 'abandoned', 'couple', 'years', 'Even', 'Laserdisc', 'collections', 'fell', 'far', 'short', 'complete.Releasing', 'series', 'chronological', 'order', 'guarantees', 'nothing', 'skipped', 'reason', 'volumes', 'are', 'abandoned', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'released', 'then', 'series', 'could', 'always', 'be', 'picked', 'up', 'where', 'last', 'left', 'off', 'when', 'round', 'volumes', 'released', 'something', 'not', 'done', 'when', 'last', 'few', 'volumes', 'were', 'best', 'compilations.I', 'would', 'like', 'take', 'time', 'here', 'dispense', 'myths', 'Beavis', 'Butt-head', 'series', 'DVD', 'One', 'do', 'not', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'video', 'commentary', 'segments', 'were', 'once', 'part', 'cartoon', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'expensive', 'nonsense', 'were', 'case', 'then', 'how', 'are', 'secondary', 'DVD', 'labels', 'able', 'release', 'music', 'video', 'collections', '15', 'get', '15', '20', 'full', 'videos', 'Here', 'MTV', 'only', 'showing', 'partial', 'videos', 'own', 'rest', 'content', 'record', 'labels', 'were', 'charging', 'full', 'royalties', 'video', 'then', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'extra', '30', 'DVD', 'MTV', 'not', 'have', 'pay', 'royalties', 'put', 'own', 'cartoon', 'DVD', 'then', 'could', 'easily', 'release', 'season', 'box', '50', 'However', 'more', 'likely', 'record', 'labels', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'MTV', 'break', 'charge', '1/4', 'royalties', 'usually', 'videos', 'were', 'cut', 'off', 'chorus', 'edited', 'short', 'would', 'be', '8', 'season', 'MTV', 'could', 'easily', 'offset', 'cost', 'anyway', 'having', 'full', 'uncut', 'videos', 'bonus', 'material', ""DVD's.The"", 'other', 'myth', 'banned', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'only', 'now', 'exist', 'edited', 'versions', 'really', 'doubt', 'MTV', 'executives', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'take', 'master', 'copies', 'completed', 'episodes', 'edit', 'Usually', 'way', 'master', 'copy', 'completed', 'copies', 'are', 'dubbed', 'actually', 'air', 'MTV', 'thus', 'protecting', 'master', 'wearing', 'out', 'repeated', 'airplay', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'several', 'dub', 'copies', 'edit', 'even', 'did', 'edit', 'finished', 'master', 'somehow', 'threw', 'out', 'copies', 'original', 'version', 'separate', 'elements', 'would', 'still', 'exist', 'could', 'easily', 'reedit', 'new', 'master', 'source', 'material', 'am', 'also', 'sure', 'animating', 'company', 'as', 'well', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'own', 'master', 'copies', 'series.Basically', 'what', 'happening', 'here', 'MTV', 'executive', 'bug', 'up', 'ass', 'not', 'want', 'episodes', 'had', 'banned', 'reappear', 'home', 'video', 'releases', 'want', 'pay', 'videos', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'As', 'long', 'people', 'keep', 'buying', 'incomplete', 'versions', 'cartoon', 'series', 'episodes', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'tanks', 'main', 'reason', 'fans', 'are', 'waiting', 'complete', 'season', 'season', 'release', 'then', 'episodes', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'included.Either', 'way', 'volume', 'just', 'have', 'Beavis', 'Butt-head', 'give', 'damn', 'then', 'would', 'not', 'bother', 'buying', 'would', 'expect', 'later', 'volumes', '[', 'are', 'released', ']', 'would', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'completing', 'series']",N/A

Anyway, ""Beavis & Butt-Head, Volume 1: The Mike Judge Collection"" is a worthy addition to your DVD collection if you enjoyed the series in the 1990's. There are 40 episodes, and thankfully, they are not interrupted by music video clips (I liked music videos, but not during ""B&B""). The standout episode is, without debate, ""The Great Cornholio"", found on Disc Two. If you remember anything about the series, it was that episode, when Beavis overdoses on sugar and caffeine, pulls his Metallica T-shirt over his head and proclaims "" I AM THE GREAT CORNHOLIO! I NEED T.P. FOR MY BUNGHOLE!!"" How creator Mike Judge came up with that episode is explained briefly on Disc Three's ""Taint Of Greatness"" segment. While I am disappointed to a degree that other episodes I remember are not on this collection (""Wood Shop"", where Beavis saws off his finger, has it re-attached and then breaks it off while picking his nose, I miss greatly), I am hopeful they'll appear on Volume 2, which is slated for release this year.

I mean yea, they are never before seen alright, never before seen with all the cruddy edits. And they are supposed to be DIRECTOR'S CUT'S.Give me a break. It's funny, on every DVD I have ever bought that was a director's cut they ADD the scenes that were originally edited out. Director's cut means the ""CUT"" or vision or version the director originally had in mind. They were being really slick and deceitful using the literal meaning of the word ""cut"" when they knew what their customers expected from the way director's cut is usually used. Thank goodness we have sites like this so people can read the reviews before they go out and spend their money for this kind of mis-representation of a product. I don't have to have season sets with videos. What I have to have before I spend my money is the episodes unedited and complete,with more of the episodes that are not being shown on MTV2 or Comedy Central. And the footage is not lost as Judge wants you to think because they show parts of the episodes that are cut from this DVD. Go figure. What really puzzles me is that people ARE buying this.

188547,AY12DBB0U420B,157330686X,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","I always liked Beavis and Butthead when their program was on MTV. I guess a lot of people did. I understand the ratings would triple when that particular program was showing. Well, it was unique, irreverent, quite different and could be very funny it times. The B & B humor always tended to be gender specific. If a mixed group watched, the men would mostly be chuckling with the women mostly thinking it was really stupid. Well, it was really stupid, and it was also very funny. It gets a lot of the same reaction as a mixed group watching ""The Three Stooges."" Here again, the guys tend to be chuckling with the women wondering who would ever watch this junk. I guess you just have to ""get it"" in order to appreciate the humor, and all of the males either are or have been teen-age boys. Mike Judge is a genius at understanding and depicting this exceedingly difficult stage in life. He also has a wry and juvenile sense of humor.Thus it was as I was strolling through my local warehouse club and noticed ""Beavis and Butthead: The Mike Judge Collection, Volume 1"" in the DVD section. I thought about it for a while and bought. It was a worthwhile collection to view and brought back a lot of forgotten chuckles. Those guys are really stupid, without question, but I can look back on my own misspent youth and see many of the same numbskull characteristics. It's funny, but maybe a little painful at the same time. Maybe that's why it gets such wide viewing. It's somewhat bittersweet. I notice that the user reviews express widely mixed reactions and I suspect a lot of the gender-specific humor may come into play here. People, in general, either seem to love B & B videos or hate them.I'm not fully satisfied with this particular DVD collection. The B & B music/video reviews were always a favorite part of the program and they're mostly missing here. Not all of my favorite episodes are included and some of the episodes which are included are not particularly good. Oh well, there's always Volumes 2 and 3 to satisfy those who have to have everything. Would I purchase these other volumes? Well, I enjoyed the first but buying the second or third is not too likely.Gary Peterson",4,"It's Stupid, Of Course.",1198195200,"12 21, 2007",2007,2183,"['always', 'liked', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'when', 'program', 'was', 'MTV', 'guess', 'lot', 'people', 'did', 'understand', 'ratings', 'would', 'triple', 'when', 'particular', 'program', 'was', 'showing', 'Well', 'was', 'unique', 'irreverent', 'quite', 'different', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'funny', 'B', 'B', 'humor', 'always', 'tended', 'be', 'gender', 'specific', 'mixed', 'group', 'watched', 'men', 'would', 'mostly', 'be', 'chuckling', 'women', 'mostly', 'thinking', 'was', 'really', 'stupid', 'Well', 'was', 'really', 'stupid', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'lot', 'same', 'reaction', 'mixed', 'group', 'watching', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Here', 'again', 'guys', 'tend', 'be', 'chuckling', 'women', 'wondering', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'watch', 'junk', 'guess', 'just', 'have', 'get', 'order', 'appreciate', 'humor', 'males', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'teen-age', 'boys', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'genius', 'understanding', 'depicting', 'exceedingly', 'difficult', 'stage', 'life', 'also', 'wry', 'juvenile', 'sense', 'humor.Thus', 'was', 'was', 'strolling', 'local', 'warehouse', 'club', 'noticed', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Collection', 'Volume', '1', 'DVD', 'section', 'thought', 'while', 'bought', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'collection', 'view', 'brought', 'back', 'lot', 'forgotten', 'chuckles', 'guys', 'are', 'really', 'stupid', 'question', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'own', 'misspent', 'youth', 'see', 'many', 'same', 'numbskull', 'characteristics', 'funny', 'maybe', 'little', 'painful', 'same', 'time', 'Maybe', 'why', 'such', 'wide', 'viewing', 'somewhat', 'bittersweet', 'notice', 'user', 'express', 'widely', 'mixed', 'reactions', 'suspect', 'lot', 'gender-specific', 'humor', 'may', 'come', 'play', 'here', 'People', 'general', 'either', 'seem', 'love', 'B', 'B', 'videos', 'hate', 'them.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'particular', 'DVD', 'collection', 'B', 'B', 'music/video', 'reviews', 'were', 'always', 'favorite', 'part', 'program', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'missing', 'here', 'Not', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'episodes', 'are', 'included', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'Oh', 'well', 'always', 'Volumes', '2', '3', 'satisfy', 'who', 'have', 'have', 'everything', 'Would', 'purchase', 'other', 'volumes', 'Well', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'buying', 'second', 'third', 'not', 'too', 'likely.Gary', 'Peterson']",N/A

(no, it's not my Internet or equipment - I can stream 1080p all day long...it's THIS show).  C'mon, Amazon!!!!I considered taking another star away because there are no music videos like when B&B; originally aired on MTV.  However, it's not Amazon's fault, and it isn't even the producers' or distributors' fault.  It's a licensing nightmare, and I understand how that works.  It's one thing for MTV to be able to broadcast the music video clips, but it's a completely different animal when it comes to DVD and on-demand, etc.  So, as much as I do wish the music video clips were there, I really do enjoy watching B&B; 20 years later.

Beavis and Butthead fans should unite and refuse to purchase this DVD collection. First of all when a company puts out a DVD set of 'selected' episodes it only means one thing. They are testing the market. If it sells enough, then they will put out the season boxes. Look how they did it with Married with Children for example.My big disappointment on this set is no ones fault though, espescially Mike Judges. My favorite part of Beavis and Butthead was the videos. We all remember how Beavis and Butthead would sit on the couch and sit through countless MTV videos. Grim Reaper's 'Rock you to Hell' was a personal favorite. Well anyway, none of that is here. You only get the stories, no video interludes. There is no way the producers were going to go to each and every band/record company and pay for the rights to have their footage on Beavis and Butthead DVDs.You get some videos, but only a handful, and they are not included in the episodes. They are in a different special section if the DVD. I don't know, it's just not as fun.And yes the shows have been edited. A friend of mine who taped every show off TV (I wish he had had cable back then a lot of it is snowy) compared his VHS MTV episodes to these DVDs. There is edited and cut lines everywhere.So folks take my advice. I'm a Beavis and Butthead fan too, but this DVD set is an abortion of a project. Boycott Vol. 1 and force the company to recall it.

188561,A6ADO7B6FUVN,157330686X,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 11]","The slapstick animation series that once aired on MTV under the name Beavis & Butt-head has been called many different things.  Some critics characterized it as the personification of stupidity and corrupt amidst a growing entertainment industry while others hailed its rebellious social criticism.  Despite the fiery criticism the show went on for a period of five years and to the making of a feature film, which was a big financial success.  In volume one, the audience can experience 40 different episodes such as 1-900-BEAVIS, Manners Suck, and the priceless The Great Cornholio.  All episodes intentionally offend and irate the audience through the dim-witted Beavis and brainless Butt-head that are both voiced by its creator Mike Judge who now is also known for Office Space (1999).It is within its own stupidity an amusing caricature of two teens in suburbia emerges, as apathy and self-destruction seems to overwhelm their existence.  Nonetheless, there are a few things that trigger some life in their seemingly hollow existence such as foul language, glue sniffing, and rock-n-roll.  They also desire women, but their carnal longing for the opposite sex is a fruitless affair.  The combination of their high testosterone and their sexual desire overflows into a Freudian obsession with words of sexual nature to which they continue to snicker and chuckle in an eternity.Through these two misfits several social issues surface such as education, teen sexuality, and other adolescent issues.  Many of them are blatantly presented without tact and consideration for the audience, as it purposely intends to shock and awe.  It is within the outrageous provocation that Mike Judge succeeds in generating a dialogue, or maybe, more of an outcry for a ban of Beavis and Butt-head.  Nonetheless, the Beavis and Butt-head show spread like wildfire, and it gained a rapidly growing number of dedicated supporters that opposed some fraction of the American society, as the youth could relate to the issues of the idiots Beavis and Butt-head.Beavis & Butt-head, Vol. 1 - The Mike Judge Collection is worth a viewing for nostalgia and laughter, as the two dense characters Beavis and Butt-head face everyday issues.  It is not as funny as many might have remembered it for the first time, but it still induces some laughter and reminiscence.

For people today who didn't grow up watching this show, it's hard to understand why fans like myself love this show so much. To most people Beavis and Butthead is a stupid show, about two stupid kids, doing stupid things, and using bad languege. But to kids who grew up in the 90's and fans this show is golden because it was so creative. Beavis and Butthead opened a lot of doors for cartoons to come afterwards, and the animated world would not have ever been the same if these two foul-mouthed, fart joke telling teenagers had never graced our tvs. Unfortunately when I finally got a hold of this box seat, I was more than dissapointed. Once again MTV has continued to shaft die hard B&B; fans by not releasing seasonal box sets, but instead ""greatest episodes"" knock offs, which is more or less what this is. The episodes were picked by series creator Mike Judge, and although there are some great episodes on here, this DVD set lacks a lot of the episodes and elements of the tv show which made it so great. Die hard fans should beware.First of all you get 40 episodes on this set, some of which have never been released on a DVD before. This is good because you now have a lot of classic B&B; episodes at your fingertips that you can watch whenever you please. Some of my personal favorite episodes like ""Beavis And Butthead Vs. The Vending Machine"" and ""Tainted Meat"" appear on this collection which is nice. The overall selection of episodes is not bad, and you somewhat come see how much the show evolved from the earlier days of episodes like ""Home Improvement"", to episodes like ""The Pipe Of Doom."" You get a varied array of episodes from every season which is good since some of the episodes are hardly aired on television anymore. The third disc is a lot of behind the scenes exclusives and interviews, which is a great treat if you are more than the average B&B; fan. There's also a documentary featuring Mike Judge on how he created to abomination known as Beavis and Butthead.Unfortunately this set has more than its fair share of problems. First just like the Timelife Beavis and Butthead collections, there's no music videos present in the episodes. This really hurts the show, because one of the most memorable aspects of watching Beavis And Butthead was listening to them trash or praise the music that most of us grew up listening to. The actual episodes themselves are also too short to stand alone by themselves, which makes most of the DVD seem like it flies by. There are 10 video critics on the DVD, but they feel tacked on, and just a way to satisfy fans who wanted them. However they aren't found within the episodes, so why bother even watching them? Considering MTV was responsible for this show, it's hard to understand why they wouldn't even at least make the effort to try to get the licenses of the videos so they could put them on the DVDs. I'm sure it wouldn't be any harder than it was to have them on the actual show when it was airing on television. The other main problem with this DVD set is the fact that the episodes are ""Director's Cuts"". At first I was happy, hoping that some episodes which had originally been too controversial for tv would be found in their entirety on this set. While some episodes have slightly added material, some have been extremely neutered. The most notable episode is ""Late Night With Butthead"", where Butthead gets the idea to have his own late night talk show. Pretty much all of the intro of the show where Butthead is inspired to have his own late night talk show has been deleted. There's also other significant portions of this episode which have been removed for no apparent reason. There are other episodes which have been altered as well, and if you would like to know which and where, there is a spotlight review at the top which tells exactly what's been altered.In addition to these problems, there's also a lack of fan favorite episodes. Like another reviewer said, just because they're Mike Judge's favorite episodes, doesn't mean they're mine. I have to wonder how seminal episodes like ""The Great Cornholio"", and ""Vaya Con Cornholio"", one of B&B;'s most famous trademarks were left out. Also other episodes that were among fan favorites like ""Butt-o-ween"" and ""Beavis and Butthead's Island"" are mysteriously absent. This is very discouraging. The fact that this DVD set has ""VOL 1"" plastered on it, isn't any reassuring, because it makes it seem like there are more bad box sets on the way. Why can't MTV just wise up and give us what we want?Overall this box set isn't very essential to anyone, even if you are a die hard Beavis and Butthead fan. The fact that MTV continues to slap fans in the face by not releasing seasonal box sets is just appalling. Sure you're getting some great episodes and nice behind the scenes footage here, but without the music videos and crude jokes that made this show so great in the first place, it's not worth the money. We can only hope that MTV will eventually come around and give us seasonal box sets like we all want. Comedy Central is now airing B&B; every week day at 7:00 PM, so I would recommend just watching that instead of buying this box set. You'll probably see every episodes found on this set on tv at one point or another. If you must buy B&B; on DVD, I'd say just get the Timelife collections instead. They have the episodes in their entirety (although once again without the music videos), and more or less you're getting the exact same thing as this set without the extras. Nothing left to say.

As a fan of Beavis and Butthead, I have to say that I fully agree wtih him.  Mike goes onto write that this DVD ""is the first volume of that two thirds"" that doesn't suck.  If this volume is any indication, the subsequent volumes will be astronomically excellent as well.  Mike has handpicked some of the funniest cartoons of all time.  These episodes are pure brilliance.  And the 11 videos contained within this DVD are some of my all time favorites.

188587,A1VSIAXJ11B2KS,157330686X,R. F. Mojica,"[20, 24]","When Beavis & Butthead first hit the airwaves, many tried to dismiss it as mere stupid moronic nonsense that would appeal to the  teen-age set. I was not a teen-ager at the time, but I recognized it immediately as the most realistic portrait of American culture that was ever aired on TV. The portrayal of the moronic hi-jinks of two morons doesn't make a program either stupid or moronic.The surprise of the whole deal was that it was aired on MTV, for MTV was realistically and unflatteringly portraying the vast bulk of their viewing audience. It was and is the only worthwhile thing MTV has ever aired. It is the only thing on MTV I've ever bothered to watch.I came upon it accidently during the very early days of its airing and, luckily, started taping the episodes almost immediately, recognizing it for what it was--an autobiography of our times more honest than anyone was willing to admit. Thus I got most of the episodes before the show became wildly popular, before big shots began noticing it and before the demand for the censorship of its contents began. Thus I got, and still have, the most subversive episodes of this show as they were originally aired.Which brings us to this DVD release of the show. Naturally MTV, one of the most worthless enterprises in human history, screwed the whole deal up. I haven't, and likely won't, buy the set, so I haven't seen it. But judging from the reviews here, it is obvious that MTV hasn't the guts to release these cartoons in their original form because the honesty of the cartoons would frighten any organization so prostrated before the fascistic gods of political correctness.It also seems obvious that the creator of the characters, Mike Judge, is embarrassed by the creations that made his fame and wealth. This is too bad but shouldn't be entirely unexpected. As he started out with B&B;, he was likely a poor unknown, doing with his cartoons what he wanted to, making them to tickle his own fancy and making his characters do what he thought was funny and  would amuse him. Once he became rich and famous, most likely his social group changed, he began moving with more ""important"" people, and the peer pressure from this group likely led him to feel shame for his former honesty. Thus in re-releasing his creations, he excised the parts of them which were offensive to his new group of peers. The self-censorship brought on by thefear of insulting or offending ""friends"" is one of the most destructive forces facing a creative artist, and most of them cannot overcome it once they have reached a stage of comfort and security they are not willing to risk or lose.Even with all this, with the censorship and with the stupidity of issuing this set as a ""selection"" rather than as a complete series, I likely would have bought this set anyway, hoping a good sale would lead to further, more complete releases. What I find intolerable is the idea that a set you BUY would include a FIVE minute commercial which you COULD NOT skip at the beginning of a disc and would be forced to watch every time you wanted to watch that disk. And that THAT commercial would be a promotion of some other MTV release, which will doubtlessly be beyond my ability to endure.There is no way I will be allow myself to be FORCED into any such indignity. This is not Soviet Russia nor Nazi Germany. I will not be forced into watching what is intolerable to me. If MTV, in their arrogance, put it up to a question of ""YOU WILL WATCH WHAT WE WANT YOU TO WATCH OR YOU WILL NOT SEE WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE"", I will not buy their product. For all their obvious admiration of police state tactics, I don't believe that these media fascists have the power to send me to a GULAG or Dachau--at least not yet.I still have my old Beavis & Butthead tapes and will stick to them until there is a release of this series which treats its fans with the respect our 25-35 dollars deserves.If there was ever justification for supporting illegal copying or bootlegging of copywrighted material, this MTV release is it.",1,what can you expect from MTV?,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,4035,"['When', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'first', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'many', 'tried', 'dismiss', 'mere', 'stupid', 'moronic', 'nonsense', 'would', 'appeal', 'teen-age', 'set', 'was', 'not', 'teen-ager', 'time', 'recognized', 'immediately', 'most', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'American', 'culture', 'was', 'ever', 'aired', 'TV', 'portrayal', 'moronic', 'hi-jinks', 'two', 'morons', ""n't"", 'make', 'program', 'stupid', 'moronic.The', 'surprise', 'whole', 'deal', 'was', 'was', 'aired', 'MTV', 'MTV', 'was', 'realistically', 'unflatteringly', 'portraying', 'vast', 'bulk', 'viewing', 'audience', 'was', 'only', 'worthwhile', 'thing', 'MTV', 'ever', 'aired', 'only', 'thing', 'MTV', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'bothered', 'watch.I', 'came', 'accidently', 'very', 'early', 'days', 'airing', 'luckily', 'started', 'taping', 'episodes', 'almost', 'immediately', 'recognizing', 'what', 'was', 'autobiography', 'times', 'more', 'honest', 'anyone', 'was', 'willing', 'admit', 'Thus', 'got', 'most', 'episodes', 'show', 'became', 'wildly', 'popular', 'big', 'shots', 'began', 'noticing', 'demand', 'censorship', 'contents', 'began', 'Thus', 'got', 'still', 'have', 'most', 'subversive', 'episodes', 'show', 'were', 'originally', 'aired.Which', 'DVD', 'release', 'show', 'Naturally', 'MTV', 'one', 'most', 'worthless', 'enterprises', 'human', 'history', 'screwed', 'whole', 'deal', 'have', ""n't"", 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'set', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'judging', 'reviews', 'here', 'obvious', 'MTV', ""n't"", 'guts', 'release', 'cartoons', 'original', 'form', 'honesty', 'cartoons', 'would', 'frighten', 'organization', 'so', 'prostrated', 'fascistic', 'gods', 'political', 'correctness.It', 'also', 'obvious', 'creator', 'characters', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'embarrassed', 'creations', 'made', 'fame', 'wealth', 'too', 'bad', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'started', 'out', 'B', 'B', 'was', 'likely', 'poor', 'unknown', 'doing', 'cartoons', 'what', 'wanted', 'making', 'tickle', 'own', 'fancy', 'making', 'characters', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'would', 'amuse', 'Once', 'became', 'rich', 'famous', 'most', 'likely', 'social', 'group', 'changed', 'began', 'moving', 'more', 'important', 'people', 'peer', 'pressure', 'group', 'likely', 'led', 'feel', 'shame', 'former', 'honesty', 'Thus', 're-releasing', 'creations', 'excised', 'parts', 'were', 'offensive', 'new', 'group', 'peers', 'self-censorship', 'brought', 'thefear', 'insulting', 'offending', 'friends', 'one', 'most', 'destructive', 'forces', 'facing', 'creative', 'artist', 'most', 'can', 'not', 'overcome', 'once', 'have', 'reached', 'stage', 'comfort', 'security', 'are', 'not', 'willing', 'risk', 'lose.Even', 'censorship', 'stupidity', 'issuing', 'set', 'selection', 'rather', 'complete', 'series', 'likely', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'set', 'anyway', 'hoping', 'good', 'sale', 'would', 'lead', 'further', 'more', 'complete', 'releases', 'What', 'find', 'intolerable', 'idea', 'set', 'BUY', 'would', 'include', 'FIVE', 'minute', 'commercial', 'COULD', 'NOT', 'skip', 'beginning', 'disc', 'would', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'time', 'wanted', 'watch', 'disk', 'commercial', 'would', 'be', 'promotion', 'other', 'MTV', 'release', 'will', 'doubtlessly', 'be', 'ability', 'endure.There', 'way', 'will', 'be', 'allow', 'be', 'FORCED', 'such', 'indignity', 'not', 'Soviet', 'Russia', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'forced', 'watching', 'what', 'intolerable', 'MTV', 'arrogance', 'put', 'up', 'question', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'WATCH', 'WHAT', 'WE', 'WANT', 'YOU', 'TO', 'WATCH', 'OR', 'YOU', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'SEE', 'WHAT', 'YOU', 'WANT', 'TO', 'SEE', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'product', 'obvious', 'admiration', 'police', 'state', 'tactics', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'media', 'fascists', 'have', 'power', 'send', 'GULAG', 'Dachau', 'least', 'not', 'yet.I', 'still', 'have', 'old', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'tapes', 'will', 'stick', 'release', 'series', 'fans', 'respect', '25-35', 'dollars', 'deserves.If', 'was', 'ever', 'justification', 'supporting', 'illegal', 'copying', 'bootlegging', 'copywrighted', 'material', 'MTV', 'release']",N/A

I have to say that I really enjoyed getting reaquainted with the boys and with Mike Judge and the writers and animators of the show. As for censorship, I have to say that for some reason I didn't start out by enjoying the first season. I think part of the reason was I had to remember what B and B were all about, and I had to get reaquainted with the style of humor. At first I was disappointed in how short the cartoons were, and how many of the cartoons simply lacked closure. Then I got used to the lack of closure and I got into the boys and into what they were all about. I think it helps to think of Beavis and Butthead as two mildly retarded kids who also lack parental supervision.As for Mike Judge's collections, I can only say that I TOO completely DISAGREE with Mike leaving at least ONE THIRD of the shows out of print. I would like ALL of the cartoons. As for the music videos, I never was much of a fan of them. Some of it is funny but perhaps a separate volume could be set aside simply for the videos. Or, Mike Judge could RE-RELEASE the show in it's COMPLETE form as SEASONS.Mike Judge, if you read this, I WILL buy the COMPLETE SEASONS if you ever release them. Just make sure they are priced fairly. And if the seasons are rather short, and they probably are since the cartoons were only five minutes each, then simply combine seasons or release them as the COMPLETE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD. Just don't rip us off.I can understand Mike Judge wanting to showcase his stronger material, but fans also want everything, or most of us do. So why not make the unreleased cartoons available? Please, I need MORE B and B.And it's NEVER TOO LATE to RESURRECT Beavis and Butthead, but leave the boys as they were. I say simply FLESH out the characters and let the boys get into more stuff, more trouble. Let the episodes be LONGER.As a fan of Mike Judge I cannot say that King of the Hill was a better cartoon. I have about 8 seasons of King of the Hill and I am glad that it finally came to an end. It's a good cartoon but B and B were funnier characters. I HOPE Mike Judge now recosiders Resurrecting B and B now that King of the Hill has come to an end.",4,"Mike Judge should release EVERYTHING, except perhaps all the videos.",1283644800,"09 5, 2010",2010,2229,"['have', 'now', 'viewed', 'entire', 'three', 'volumes', 'Beavia', 'Butthead', 'have', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'getting', 'reaquainted', 'boys', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'writers', 'animators', 'show', 'censorship', 'have', 'say', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'start', 'out', 'enjoying', 'first', 'season', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'was', 'had', 'remember', 'what', 'B', 'B', 'were', 'had', 'get', 'reaquainted', 'style', 'humor', 'first', 'was', 'disappointed', 'how', 'short', 'cartoons', 'were', 'how', 'many', 'cartoons', 'simply', 'lacked', 'closure', 'Then', 'got', 'used', 'lack', 'closure', 'got', 'boys', 'what', 'were', 'think', 'think', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'two', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'kids', 'who', 'also', 'lack', 'parental', 'supervision.As', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'collections', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'TOO', 'completely', 'DISAGREE', 'Mike', 'leaving', 'least', 'ONE', 'THIRD', 'shows', 'print', 'would', 'like', 'ALL', 'cartoons', 'music', 'videos', 'never', 'was', 'much', 'fan', 'funny', 'perhaps', 'separate', 'volume', 'could', 'be', 'set', 'aside', 'simply', 'videos', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'could', 'RE-RELEASE', 'show', 'COMPLETE', 'form', 'SEASONS.Mike', 'Judge', 'read', 'WILL', 'buy', 'COMPLETE', 'SEASONS', 'ever', 'release', 'Just', 'make', 'sure', 'are', 'priced', 'fairly', 'seasons', 'are', 'rather', 'short', 'probably', 'are', 'cartoons', 'were', 'only', 'five', 'minutes', 'then', 'simply', 'combine', 'seasons', 'release', 'COMPLETE', 'BEAVIS', 'AND', 'BUTTHEAD', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'rip', 'can', 'understand', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'wanting', 'showcase', 'stronger', 'material', 'fans', 'also', 'want', 'everything', 'most', 'do', 'So', 'why', 'not', 'make', 'unreleased', 'cartoons', 'available', 'Please', 'need', 'MORE', 'B', 'B.And', 'NEVER', 'TOO', 'LATE', 'RESURRECT', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'leave', 'boys', 'were', 'say', 'simply', 'FLESH', 'out', 'characters', 'let', 'boys', 'get', 'more', 'stuff', 'more', 'trouble', 'Let', 'episodes', 'be', 'LONGER.As', 'fan', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'King', 'Hill', 'was', 'better', 'cartoon', 'have', '8', 'seasons', 'King', 'Hill', 'am', 'glad', 'finally', 'came', 'end', 'good', 'cartoon', 'B', 'B', 'were', 'funnier', 'characters', 'HOPE', 'Judge', 'now', 'Resurrecting', 'B', 'B', 'now', 'King', 'Hill', 'come', 'end']",N/A

While it is true that ""Beavis & Butt-head, Vol. 1 - The Mike Judge Collection"" generally does consist of the best episodes from the series, it is also true that some of the shows have been edited, which detracts from them as they originally aired. While most of the editing is very minor, some is more obvious, and appears to have been done in a fawning attempt at political correctness, as if that is conceivable when dealing with Beavis and Butt-head.I really wanted to like this set, but I can only give it two stars based on two primary factors: first, the editing; and second, the painful advertisements at the beginning of the discs. These are very long, very obnoxious advertisements at the beginning of the discs that are for products I would never conceivably be interested in, and which cannot be skipped. It's bad enough that the ads are there in the first place, but to force the viewer to watch them after paying good money for the DVD set is onerous. On the positive side, though, there are some extras that most people will not have in their collections, which is a genuine bonus.While it is good to finally see these come out on DVD (although I am glad I hung onto my VHS copies) this could have been so much better than it is.

I miss B&B;, the videos, and my all time favorites, 'Way Down Mexico Way' and 'Peace, Love, and Understanding'.By the way, here is my personal list of edited DVD's in my collection -THE EDIT LIST:1 - The History of Beavis & Butthead (Recalled Paramount release edits 'Good Credit', 'Bedpans and Broomsticks', the beginning of 'Give Blood' and 'Door to Door' and other things)2 - Ren & Stimpy UNCUT (Of course, it is cut)3 - Married With Children Season 4 (7 edited episodes)4 - Tom & Jerry Collection 1 (Gee, why not alter our history for the next generation?)5 - Tom & Jerry Collection 2 (Mammy dubbed in 4 episodes)6 - The Blues Brothers (Theatrical Version edits a Belushi line)7 - Star Wars Eps IV, V, and VI (I would buy these all over again if I could get them completely uncut and original)8 - Blade Runner (Theatrical Version unavailable - cut version sucks!)9 - Time Life's 'There Goes The Neighborhood' (Edits thinner sniffing scene from 'Home Improvement')and now.....10 - Beavis & Butt-head: The Mike Judge CollectionThere oughtta be a law!",1,I'd give this 0 stars if I could,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2041,"['am', 'Sterculius', 'have', 'offended', 'Edited', '=', '0', 'stars.I', 'dare', 'watch', 'Time', 'Life', 'Butt-O-Ween', 'version', ""'Late"", 'Night', 'Butt-Head', 'then', 'watch', 'missing', 'almost', '3', 'minutes', 'awesome', 'footage', ""'The"", 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Collection', 'Same', '1-900-Beavis', ""'"", 'end', ""'Manners"", 'Suck', 'hate', 'edits', 'have', 'personal', 'vendetta', 'edits.Interestingly', 'enough', 'now', 'have', 'footage', ""'original"", 'version', ""'Home"", 'Improvement', 'Allow', 'explain', 'Time', 'Life', 'version', ""'Home"", 'Improvement', 'had', 'paint', 'thinner', 'sniffing', 'scene', 'edited', 'out', 'BUT', ""'The"", 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Collection', 'sniffing', 'scene', 'back', 'CUTTING', 'beginning', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'ending', 'footage', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'saying', 'cops', 'think', 'were', 'oriental', '.We', 'have', 'been', 'betrayed', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'was', 'watching', 'B', 'B', 'greatest', 'happiest', 'years', 'life', 'early', '20', 'now', 'am', 'bankrupt', 'alone', 'depressed', 'want', 'are', 'old', 'friends', 'get', 'buzzed', 'miss', 'B', 'B', 'videos', 'time', 'favorites', 'Down', 'Mexico', 'Way', ""'Peace"", 'Love', ""Understanding'.By"", 'way', 'here', 'personal', 'list', 'edited', 'DVD', 'collection', '-THE', 'EDIT', 'LIST:1', 'History', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'Recalled', 'Paramount', 'release', 'Credit', ""'Bedpans"", 'Broomsticks', 'beginning', ""'Give"", 'Blood', ""'Door"", 'Door', 'other', 'things', '2', 'Ren', 'Stimpy', 'UNCUT', 'course', 'cut', '3', 'Married', 'Children', 'Season', '4', '7', 'edited', 'episodes', '4', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Collection', '1', 'Gee', 'why', 'not', 'alter', 'history', 'next', 'generation', '5', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'Collection', '2', 'Mammy', 'dubbed', '4', 'episodes', '6', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'Belushi', 'line', '7', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Eps', 'IV', 'V', 'VI', 'would', 'buy', 'over', 'again', 'could', 'get', 'completely', 'uncut', 'original', '8', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Theatrical', 'Version', 'unavailable', 'cut', 'version', 'sucks', '9', 'Time', 'Life', ""'There"", 'Neighborhood', 'Edits', 'thinner', 'sniffing', 'scene', ""'Home"", 'Improvement', 'now', '..10', 'Beavis', 'Butt-head', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'CollectionThere', 'oughtta', 'be', 'law']",N/A

Here is an original Flyer that was included in the packaging: """"Dear Customer, Thanks for Buying this DVD. I've often said that there's about a third of Beavis and Butt-Head that I think is great and I'm really proud of, another third that is that is okay, and then another third that's really awful and embarrassing. A while back, I talked with the folks at MTV and we agreed to put out a DVD set that would contain the two thirds that didn't suck and call it ""The Mike Judge Collection."" This is the first volume of that two thirds. Thanks and enjoy, Mike Judge"" Well that about sums it up. on this 3 DVD set you'll get the first part of the collection. It doesn't say how many will follow. But they will have to be bought. On the first 2 Discs you 'll find 20 episodes each (the cartoons, not the music Videos) and on Disc 3 you will find The following Music Videos: (with their special commentary ofcourse): Matthew Sweet: ""Superdeformed"", Pantera: ""This Love"", Moist: ""Push"", Deus: ""Suds & Soda"", Grim Reaper: ""Fear No Evil"", Monster Magnet: ""Negasonic Teenage Warhead"", Korn: ""Blind"", Catherine Wheel: ""Waydown"", Beastie Boys:"" Pass the Mic"", Wilco: ""Box Full of Letter"" and finally: Hum:"" Stars"". And there are some Special Features: Featurette: ""Taint of Greatnetness: The Hourney of Beavis & Butt-Head, Part 1,  Beavis & Butt-Head Thanksgiving Special with Kurt Loder,  Beavis & Butt-Head Video Music Awards Appearances, An Interactive link to Mike Judge and Don Hertzfeldt`s: The Animation Show website,  Beavis & Butt-Head Promos, Montages: Terms of Endearment and the Greatest Hits.""""Well to say it all: A well rounded package for those who are still young enough (at least in their mind) to enjoy it.The whole thing is in 16:9 (which is strange beause the episodes weren't back then).And since it's only CDN$ 39.60 you are getting a real good deal.I myself just got it from amazon.ca back here in Austria.. Just watching it.. The Picture Quality is Great. The Extras are great... The complete Running time is 214 minutes.And what I forgot: There is a lot of previously censored material. (Edited on TV) and now you get it all. I know, I sound like a promoter, but I really liked this compilation and it's really worth it. They picked the best episodes and restored the material very good. BTW: I think it's more than 214 minutes because the first disc already runs 100 minutes, so I guess it will run longer than the 214 minutes they say it is long.

However, like other people who also liked the show, I have to agree with them to release all of the episodes (for goodness sake!

The reason why this is merely a collection of, and not a full first season is because not every band is willing to allow the use of their videos on the dvd collection. Now, before everyone begins asking ""Well, they were aired on with videos in tow on MTV, why can't they now?"" Obviosuly, it's about money. Some bands will do anything they can to earn a quick buck, and if they think they can get royalties off the sales of B&B dvd collections, they will try. I think it sucks, but unless every band would agree to the use of their music videos, there will never be a complete satisfactory collection of B&B dvds, because watching them make fun of the videos was one of the funniest parts of the show.

188609,A1MVLTJ0KUNCIU,157330686X,"Yvonne P. Joseph ""Yvonne Joseph""","[3, 10]","I am quite amazed by the many negative reviews of this ""Beavis and Butthead: The Mike Judge Collection"" dvd set.  I find nothing wrong with it, and am enjoying Beavis and Butthead. I watch the cartoons a few at a time, and often laugh myself to tears! Edited or not, Beavis and Butthead are simply funny, and outright stupid!I bought mine for $29.99 the week before the holidays, and was quite glad I purchased it at this discount price.  I returned to the store, today, and found the dvd set returned to its $37.99 price.I do agree that I miss seeing the music videos interspersed during the cartoons like when it airs on MTV, because I enjoy them.  But, hey!  At least, we get 11 of them on Disc 3! And even though they are few, they are just as funny with Beavis and Butthead's familiar commentary!  I found myself cracking up just the same. My favorite is the video where Butthead tells Beavis to go prepare some pancakes for them while he (Butthead) sits and watches the videos.  The back-and-forth exchange between the two as Beavis asks Butthead how pancakes are prepared is hilarious!  Despite that I happily own this set, I still videotape B and B on MTV on weeknights.  So I can still enjoy the music videos and B and B's commentary whenever I want to see them.Perhaps this little tip may help some of the irate owners of this new Beavis and Butthead dvd set to cope with the lack of music videos in-between the cartoons (although I may end up getting snide comments for it!).  How about this:  In ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"" there were NO music videos with Beavis and Butthead giving their amusing commentaries about them in the entire film.  The film was still funny, and most of us loved it!  So, at least there are some of the music videos available in this dvd set for us to enjoy.  Who knows?  Perhaps Mike Judge may be able to get the copyrights of a few more videos when he brings out Volume 2 of the Beavis and Butthead dvd set.  We'll just have to wait and see.I understand devout B and B fans want Season box sets of the series, and I hope they get their wish granted.  But in the meantime, this dvd set is just fine for me.  I wasn't interested in B and B when Time-Life videos first produced their dvd set.  Now, I enjoy - and love - Beavis and Butthead, and I'm glad this new dvd set came out, enabling me to get my own copy.  Plus the extras on Disc 3, such as their television 'appearances' on the MTV music awards, with David Letterman, and with Kurt Loder on the Thanksgiving Day special, and other clips and promos with B and B are pretty neat gems to have on disc!In regard to those annoying MTV ads of non-Beavis and Butthead material on the discs, I simply cue them off using the >> button on my dvd remote control.  I could care less about those. The only ad I watch is the first (on Disc 1) with Beavis and Butthead episodes on AmpMobile phone. That's it.I eagerly look forward to Mike Judge releasing Volume 2 of the Beavis and Butthead series.  From the negative comments seen so far, I hope he doesn't change his mind!  Having this dvd set is better than having none at all with Beavis and Butthead!I hope that with Volume 2, Judge releases ""Water Safety"", with Beavis and Butthead in swim class, where Butthead nearly drowns.  I've seen clips of this on two B and B websites.  I'll enjoy this episode because swimming is my favorite sport and hobby.  In addition to ""Water Safety"", I hope he includes ""Ding Dong Ditch"", where the moronic duo annoys their neighbors by ringing their doorbells, and running off.  Again, I read the synopsis on the Internet. Last of all, I hope he includes several more episodes with B and B at their job at Burger World.In conclusion:  I love my set, and don't plan anytime on selling or discarding mine.  I'm glad I acted quickly two weeks ago when I grabbed up the B and B set (with Butthead's image on the cover sneering at me), and kept the box in my grip as I stood on the long cashier's line to purchase it. That's right: I had no intention of letting it go, or putting it down. This Beavis and Butthead dvd set may become a collector's item in time.  So, mine is for keeps!",5,Complaints?? -- I haven't any!
