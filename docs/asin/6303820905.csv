385571,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,6303820905,a gentle sound,"[5, 6]","I'm a Scot and a whole lot of mixed things. Irish among them, that lost a great connection to family history in the immigration to America long, long past. I'm also a teacher among those things, lover of story, American, with nothing to add here that the hundreds of reviewers haven't eloquently spoken. What a masterful movie maker and movie. But it's St. Patty's Day and this is the movie I've shared for ages with my classes to set the tone and introduce the ""culture of Ireland.""Asking permission of course.It's a movie that for kids starts with a child losing her mum, losing her brother,now going back to her grandparents who are living by the sea with a father not coping well with any of this, earning his way now in the city.He's a drunk and you can't blame him drowning in sorrow and guilt. She, Fiona, returns all by herself, a first glimpse into her independence and character (and situation) to Grandparents displaced off their beloved island by war. But they love it as their center, and they tell her of it, and of themselves so she might be re-entered into the heart of family. Splintered they are by these tragedies.This I know well from my own family way, telling you of who you came from. It's gauzy, you feel pieces of understanding building meanings, you have back story, flash backward, enter myths and dreams and gain an understanding of these people, crawling through the tales. Genius willingness to allow you slowly into both the terrible that's happened, but also who they are, how the stage is set for accepting what will be. All well done work.The children I teach at first watching struggle with this, as we are just now talking about how time can work in stories and I stop and give pieces of explanation. The story centers on Fiona as she snuggles into her life with her grandparents getting out of the filth of the city, no place for a child. She wants to open up the story of her brother, hear what happened, know about him, a tiny infant lost at sea when their family was removed from this island. She wants to wander into the place I think I'd call the silences of things we cannot face. She is the one brave enough to lead them all on forward. It's important to note that is built beautifully, acted simply, and just as fresh as the spray off the sea here.And as she does this, as she goes back to the island, as the movie progresses into something surreal and about the power of myth, she takes her audience, us, into the places myth serves. It's as if while we are healing with them, retelling to lead to acceptance, sharing this pain, while we are dreaming and designing what can be, what comes to pass, the miracle here, it starts to bring to my class actual joy and a sense of wonder. I cannot reveal so much without giving the plot away (and it certainly is revealed in other reviews)  but this family so used to hardship remarkably through their young get a break, yet it comes in the magical realism. It is a miracle.So why use this with a class, why watch year after year? I am very fond of how this uses flashback and dream sequences in talking to time and memory with children. It has a place in talking to people's ways of telling to their young the story of family, something my kids understand, it has a heroine-a character who is female that asks questions, investigates, seeks what she knows to be true. It discusses truth interestingly along the way. And the film speaks to the silkies, man's ties to animal, a people living in fishing and the sea many generations, their hard work and respect for the home they have, for the children. It helps us talk about how myth grows. It's purposes. It's familiar just as it is distant. The sound of the voices, the sound of the seas, all of this the filmmaker captures, designs and gives to the children.Everyone knows this film has been around a long time. It's tested and true as a story worth seeing. This day I'm out of school sadly not sharing the holiday with my class too ill, but we will finish it tomorrow on my return. Despite everything they'll cheer that. No class ever failed to vote it one of the best experiences I provided. I think because it's embedded within a culture and family with a wee naked baby running through and it ends as we wish it might, it is a movie, and we have permission to allow things to be ok, just for a little while.And that feels like the gift story can bring. Well worth watching.Happy St. Patrick's...may you find yourself in a happy ending.",5,An it be a fine way to introduce a people in love with story,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,4480,"[""'m"", 'Scot', 'whole', 'lot', 'mixed', 'things', 'Irish', 'lost', 'great', 'connection', 'family', 'history', 'immigration', 'America', 'long', 'long', 'past', ""'m"", 'also', 'teacher', 'things', 'lover', 'story', 'American', 'nothing', 'add', 'here', 'hundreds', 'reviewers', 'have', ""n't"", 'eloquently', 'spoken', 'What', 'masterful', 'movie', 'maker', 'movie', 'St.', 'Patty', 'Day', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'ages', 'classes', 'set', 'tone', 'introduce', 'culture', 'Ireland', 'Asking', 'permission', 'course.It', 'movie', 'kids', 'starts', 'child', 'losing', 'mum', 'losing', 'brother', 'now', 'going', 'back', 'grandparents', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'sea', 'father', 'not', 'coping', 'well', 'earning', 'way', 'now', 'city.He', 'drunk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'drowning', 'sorrow', 'guilt', 'Fiona', 'first', 'glimpse', 'independence', 'character', 'situation', 'Grandparents', 'displaced', 'off', 'beloved', 'island', 'war', 'love', 'center', 'tell', 'might', 'be', 're-entered', 'heart', 'family', 'Splintered', 'are', 'tragedies.This', 'know', 'well', 'own', 'family', 'way', 'telling', 'who', 'came', 'gauzy', 'feel', 'pieces', 'understanding', 'building', 'meanings', 'have', 'back', 'story', 'flash', 'backward', 'enter', 'myths', 'dreams', 'gain', 'understanding', 'people', 'crawling', 'tales', 'Genius', 'willingness', 'allow', 'slowly', 'terrible', 'happened', 'also', 'who', 'are', 'how', 'stage', 'set', 'accepting', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'well', 'done', 'work.The', 'children', 'teach', 'first', 'watching', 'struggle', 'are', 'just', 'now', 'talking', 'how', 'time', 'can', 'work', 'stories', 'stop', 'give', 'pieces', 'explanation', 'story', 'centers', 'Fiona', 'life', 'grandparents', 'getting', 'filth', 'city', 'place', 'child', 'open', 'up', 'story', 'brother', 'hear', 'what', 'happened', 'know', 'tiny', 'infant', 'lost', 'sea', 'when', 'family', 'was', 'removed', 'island', 'wander', 'place', 'think', ""'d"", 'call', 'silences', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'face', 'one', 'brave', 'enough', 'lead', 'forward', 'important', 'note', 'built', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'simply', 'just', 'as', 'fresh', 'spray', 'sea', 'here.And', 'back', 'island', 'movie', 'something', 'surreal', 'power', 'myth', 'audience', 'places', 'myth', 'serves', 'are', 'healing', 'retelling', 'lead', 'acceptance', 'sharing', 'pain', 'are', 'dreaming', 'designing', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'what', 'pass', 'miracle', 'here', 'bring', 'class', 'actual', 'joy', 'sense', 'wonder', 'can', 'not', 'reveal', 'so', 'much', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'certainly', 'revealed', 'other', 'reviews', 'family', 'so', 'used', 'hardship', 'remarkably', 'young', 'get', 'break', 'magical', 'realism', 'miracle.So', 'why', 'use', 'class', 'why', 'watch', 'year', 'year', 'am', 'very', 'fond', 'how', 'flashback', 'dream', 'sequences', 'talking', 'time', 'memory', 'children', 'place', 'talking', 'people', 'ways', 'telling', 'young', 'story', 'family', 'something', 'kids', 'understand', 'heroine-a', 'character', 'who', 'female', 'asks', 'questions', 'investigates', 'what', 'be', 'true', 'truth', 'interestingly', 'way', 'film', 'silkies', 'man', 'ties', 'animal', 'people', 'living', 'fishing', 'sea', 'many', 'generations', 'hard', 'work', 'respect', 'home', 'have', 'children', 'talk', 'how', 'myth', 'grows', 'purposes', 'familiar', 'just', 'distant', 'sound', 'voices', 'sound', 'seas', 'filmmaker', 'designs', 'children.Everyone', 'film', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'tested', 'true', 'story', 'worth', 'seeing', 'day', ""'m"", 'school', 'sadly', 'not', 'sharing', 'holiday', 'class', 'too', 'ill', 'will', 'finish', 'tomorrow', 'return', 'everything', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'class', 'ever', 'failed', 'vote', 'one', 'best', 'experiences', 'provided', 'think', 'embedded', 'culture', 'family', 'wee', 'naked', 'baby', 'running', 'wish', 'might', 'movie', 'have', 'permission', 'allow', 'things', 'be', 'ok', 'just', 'little', 'while.And', 'gift', 'story', 'can', 'bring', 'Well', 'watching.Happy', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'may', 'find', 'happy', 'ending']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS

You can add this beautiful Irish gem to the mix.`The Secret of Roan Inish' tells the story of a young girl, Fiona, as she travels to live with her grandparents in the countryside.  Her mother has recently died and her father has turned to alcohol to cure his depression.  Fiona leaves the city and ventures to her grandparent's home, where she begins to entertain seeming fantasies concerning her deceased baby brother Jamie.  The story goes that when the family was forced to evacuate their homes on the Isle of Roan Inish, baby Jamie was washed out to sea.  But there is more to the story, and as Fiona soon discovers, her blood is tainted with the blood of the Selkies (basically Irish mermaids; half human-half seal) and her brother may not be dead afterall.This soft and sweet little film is a wonder for parents and children.  I don't recommend it for the real young, simply because the film is slower paced and could be boring for them.  The accents are also VERY thick and so that may be an issue for the kids.

385579,A3FVAWZNKW9GX,6303820905,"A.Trendl HungarianBookstore.com ""What should ...","[7, 7]","""The Secret of Roan Inish"" is underrated. Prime Irish storytelling in the form of a movie and a powerfully authentic Irish score are the foundation of a complex movie that will be replayed for decades.Mick Lally gives an incredible performance as he tells Fiona, a young lass, the story of what Roan Inish has meant to him, and what had happened. In a pure and song-like brogue he brings to life her thoughts and dreams about what might be true.Others about town tell her this and that, and she checks out the stories for herself.On the surface, the movie presents a fantasy with whimsy. Underneath it all, we can see the change parts of Ireland's sea community has felt, what this means to the Gaelic language and old Irish culture. We see the syncretism of Roman Catholicism with Irish superstition, and the practical yet fulfilling lives of the people who once lived on Roan Inish.Jeni Courtney, who plays Fiona, pulls off her role well, as do the other younger actors. There are a few parts in which I think the story asked us to make a few jumps, but in the end, the movie works.In a spirit similar to ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" we have females characters, and a story to be appreciated at all ages. It strikes a note of traditional movie making in a way that this DVD will be replayed at many a Christmas holiday.I recommend ""The Secret of Roan Inish.""Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",4,Childlike Faith and Wonderous Dreams,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",2002,1401,"['Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'underrated', 'Prime', 'Irish', 'storytelling', 'form', 'movie', 'powerfully', 'authentic', 'Irish', 'score', 'are', 'foundation', 'complex', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'replayed', 'decades.Mick', 'Lally', 'incredible', 'performance', 'Fiona', 'young', 'lass', 'story', 'what', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'meant', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'pure', 'song-like', 'brogue', 'life', 'thoughts', 'dreams', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'true.Others', 'town', 'tell', 'out', 'stories', 'herself.On', 'surface', 'movie', 'fantasy', 'whimsy', 'can', 'see', 'change', 'parts', 'Ireland', 'sea', 'community', 'felt', 'what', 'Gaelic', 'language', 'old', 'Irish', 'culture', 'see', 'syncretism', 'Roman', 'Catholicism', 'Irish', 'superstition', 'practical', 'yet', 'fulfilling', 'lives', 'people', 'who', 'once', 'lived', 'Roan', 'Inish.Jeni', 'Courtney', 'who', 'Fiona', 'role', 'well', 'do', 'other', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'few', 'parts', 'think', 'story', 'asked', 'make', 'few', 'jumps', 'end', 'movie', 'spirit', 'similar', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'have', 'females', 'characters', 'story', 'be', 'appreciated', 'ages', 'note', 'traditional', 'movie', 'making', 'way', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'replayed', 'many', 'Christmas', 'holiday.I', 'recommend', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'Anthony', 'Trendleditor', 'HungarianBookstore.com']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS
385580,AORW1FRF4D4KS,6303820905,azindn,"[11, 13]","The Secret of Roan Inish is a unique film which reveals in a slow paced story, the relationship of the Irish people to the sea and land. Roan Inish weaves its magic through the well written dialogue of characters who tell the story of a family ancestor who was a mythological selkie, as well as the lost infant raised by seals who populate the abandoned island. They comment on the loss of native language and culture by a generation of young islanders who left for jobs in the city. The return of a small island girl to her grandparents permits director John Sayles to examine with the girl, the island's history, and its community whose knowledge is grounded in oral history and the past. Set in the post-war economy, desire to leave the old ways to incorporate benefits of modern urban life is seen only briefly as intrusive on the people whose community is intimately tied to the sea. The strength of the film is in how it presents the need and place of intergenerational knowledge, the preservation of the language, and the unique place of ethnic heritage based in oral traditions.What sets this film apart from others is how it is a ""family film"" without resorting to clich&eacute;s, but instead, is the kind of movie entertaining to all age groups without talking down to anyone. That the film was not better marketed is likely the fault of the studio that did not know how to sell the film's idea to American audiences grown accustomed to mindless car chases, exploding buildings, and gratuitous violence as well as irritating, smart-mouth kid actors. Roan Inish has none of these elements although the brief nudity of one child actor could offend some who would find offense in any presentation of the human form in any context. But for this, the film allows audiences to be drawn into the story of children who value and desire to restore their heritage and family, and take responsibility to act.The production values of this film are high, its plot thoroughly believable. DP Haskell Wexler uses the beauty of the Irish countryside to paint a stunning image of the landscape and sea that makes one wish to return to the old sod. Sayles's cast are character actors not familiar to most audiences in the US, but who are able to carry the film with authenticity and grace. The child actors are especially mature and believable. This is a film that should be seen by more audiences but probably won't and that is unfortunate for The Secret of Roan Inish is a gem in a sea of mediocre Hollywood fare.

Moreover, its yet one more example of how mysticism has contributed to keeping the Irish impoverished as well as enslaved to England for 800 years.Given the potential of the Irish mind, its disheartening to think how so much talent has been wasted in favor of religious ignorance. I can buy that Fiona's acceptance of mysticism is helpful in dealing with her loss. Its more the passing references to Christianity so deeply instilled in Irish culture that reminds us, once again, that its this festering ignorance that has kept us down for so long. On the other hand, when a civilization is endlessly oppressed, I suppose its difficult not to turn away from reason, or to never be given the chance to find reason in the first place.Reviews of this movie are a bit overstated.

385588,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,6303820905,Char,"[1, 1]","Excellent, beautiful, inoffensive.  The story is an absorbing and unusual one, experienced through the eyes of a young girl.  The experience struck me as having a somewhat dreamlike quality.  You see it; you awake from the dream; you know you've been through something that touched you in a deep way but the meaning remains mysterious.This is a REAL-life story intertwined with the Irish folk legend of selkies, a sometimes-human race of seals.  The setting is within the home of a fisherman, within a fisher-farmer community, in very  beautiful green countryside and rocky islands near the sea.  The action takes place after WWII but seems timeless, or for all times, as it touches upon the mystery of  ""generational"" life in families, the chances of life that draw couples together, the fates of their children, the search for identity within the context of family life....  (If you wonder what in the world I mean by these last statements, you'll just have to watch the movie and see then at the end if you agree with what I'm trying to describe.  This movie had somewhat the same effect on me as does some old Irish folk music, creating an almost painful, keening, longing that rises from mysteries of human and Godly love hidden in one's ""DNA,"" hidden in the past.  It's something rather inexplicable.  --Maybe such a response to Irish music and stories only happens to people from an Irish heritage...?  But, anyway...)The four main characters are two young people and two of their grandparents.  Throughout the movie, one doesn't quite know how to feel toward the grandmother who seems to be a negative ""blockader"" of sorts--until the end, when ""revelations"" occur and actions move into the turning point.Seems from some of the dialogue that the exact geographical setting is supposed to be near Donegal.  One of the families is surnamed Keneally (or Connelly), and this seems to be more or less a legend about that family--but whether or not there is such a legend in actual fact, I don't know.  There may have been another family surname mentioned in the story but, as usual when I watch movies where the dialogue is spoken with Irish or British accents, I had trouble understanding a lot of what was said.  Nevertheless, from what I did hear and see, I was able to comprehend the plot very well.  Enough so that I was very moved by the story and cried at the end.Going into it, I thought that this was a movie for children.  Actually, it would be in the ""family movie"" category.  Anyone from about 10 years of age on up would probably enjoy it, but adults would be able to appreciate it best.This story would be appealing to people who've experienced a special brother-and-sister bond of love.The movie begins and ends with brief flashes of information about ""the mother"" in the story who died at the young age of 36.  She is a fairly important background character and I think it's an interesting coincidence that I happened to pick up and watch this movie, without knowing anything about it, early in the morning on Mother's Day.  (And later in the day, a further coincidence was that the sermon at church touched upon some points about family life that were consistent with some of the realities depicted in this story!)The sound-track features moments of Irish piping, fiddling, and drumming.The ""Cradle-Boat"" in which little Jamie goes to sea is unforgettable!

The secrets of Roan Inish are kept by the seals and the selkies that swim around in its waters.Fiona learns about the selkies as part of an explanation as to why one 'dark one' (dark hair and eyes) appear in every generation of her family.  Selkies are seals that can shed there skin and become human.  They can roam the earth and live and love like normal people, however, they always long for the sea.  If a selkie finds their skin, they will always return to the sea.This movie isn't only about the seals and selkies, it's also about families and traditions, homes and histories, about finding lost loved ones and discovering new ones.  Everything about this movie is wonderful; the scenery is breathtaking, the actors are amazing, the story imaginative and brilliant.

385594,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,6303820905,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[1, 1]","If John Sayles, the independent American filmmaker, is not the greatest director in the history of the medium, he certainly has to be considered among the most daring and diverse filmmakers ever. From tales set in America's past (Matewan), to yuppy dramadies (The Return Of The Secaucus Seven), to urban social satires (The Brother From Another Planet), to more modern looks at American life (Sunshine State, Lone Star, Casa De Los Babys), Sayles has shown a desire to explore things no other filmmaker has. And while he does not have a distinctive look nor style, each of films is well wrought, and a worthy addition to world cinema. One of his most daring films was actually one of his most popular and financially successful- 1995's Irish fantasy film, The Secret Of Roan Inish.Ok, let me rephrase- to call The Secret Of Roan Inish a fantasy film- even if Sayles  adapted the screenplay from a 1957 children's book (The Secret Of Ron Mor Skerry) by Rosalie K. Fry, is to sell it short. It is a very sly and deep look at childhood and the loneliness that accompanies such. In this way, it is very much in league with such other explorations of early childhood loneliness as Val Lewton's 1944 film The Curse Of The Cat People and 1968's Godzilla's Revenge. It is also very much a great family film along the lines of October Sky and My Dog Skip.It is also very much a mythic film. That term is often overused to describe films that deal with `epic' characters or situations, but that sort of description and film too often wallows in the pseudo-babble of faux intellectuals like Joseph Campbell. This film succeeds by using the exact opposite tack- it presents the film very much from a child's eye point of view, that of its lead character Fiona Coneely (Jeni Courtney)- a cute ten year old blond girl who goes to live with her grandparents after World War Two, because her mother has died, and her father has had to go off to Scotland to find work.The film did only mediocre at the box office, but that's because it is a terrific and deep film that never condescends. It is a children's film sans explosions and wiseass children, and explodes the idea that films aimed at children need be lesser versions of their adult counterparts. In fact, they have a greater charge- to appeal to kids as well as adults, and on both levels. Children's films, in fact, should have more ideas crammed into them as children can absorb more and learn from them without the biases and fears that a typical adult has acquired.The film runs a crisp hour and forty-three minutes, and not a second is wasted. The only quibble one might have with the film is its title. It really should have been called The Secrets (plural) Of Roan Inish, for more than the secret of Jamie's fate is involved. Yet, the flaws in this film are very minor- such as Fiona's repeated inability to outwit her wild child brother, compared to the film's virtues- almost all else. The Secret Of Roan Inish is one of Sayles' best films, and arguably a great film in its own right. That this film did what it did with so little shows that true creativity thrives no matter what its source of nourishment is, and that when that creativity is a product of John Sayles' mind, it's likely to be something well beyond the norm.",4,Great,1221868800,"09 20, 2008",2008,3275,"['John', 'Sayles', 'independent', 'American', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'greatest', 'director', 'history', 'medium', 'certainly', 'be', 'considered', 'most', 'daring', 'diverse', 'filmmakers', 'ever', 'tales', 'set', 'America', 'past', 'Matewan', 'yuppy', 'dramadies', 'Return', 'Secaucus', 'Seven', 'urban', 'social', 'satires', 'Brother', 'From', 'Planet', 'more', 'modern', 'looks', 'American', 'life', 'Sunshine', 'State', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Casa', 'De', 'Los', 'Babys', 'Sayles', 'shown', 'desire', 'explore', 'things', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'not', 'have', 'distinctive', 'look', 'style', 'films', 'well', 'wrought', 'worthy', 'addition', 'world', 'cinema', 'One', 'most', 'daring', 'films', 'was', 'actually', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'financially', 'successful-', '1995', 'Irish', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish.Ok', 'let', 'rephrase-', 'call', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'fantasy', 'film-', 'even', 'Sayles', 'adapted', 'screenplay', '1957', 'children', 'book', 'Secret', 'Ron', 'Mor', 'Skerry', 'Rosalie', 'K.', 'Fry', 'sell', 'short', 'very', 'sly', 'deep', 'look', 'childhood', 'loneliness', 'such', 'way', 'very', 'much', 'league', 'such', 'other', 'explorations', 'early', 'childhood', 'loneliness', 'Val', 'Lewton', '1944', 'film', 'Curse', 'Cat', 'People', '1968', 'Godzilla', 'Revenge', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'great', 'family', 'film', 'lines', 'October', 'Sky', 'My', 'Dog', 'Skip.It', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'mythic', 'film', 'term', 'often', 'overused', 'describe', 'films', 'deal', 'epic', 'characters', 'situations', 'sort', 'description', 'film', 'too', 'often', 'pseudo-babble', 'faux', 'intellectuals', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'film', 'using', 'exact', 'opposite', 'tack-', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'child', 'eye', 'point', 'view', 'lead', 'character', 'Fiona', 'Coneely', 'Jeni', 'Courtney', 'cute', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'blond', 'girl', 'who', 'live', 'grandparents', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'mother', 'died', 'father', 'had', 'go', 'off', 'Scotland', 'find', 'work.The', 'film', 'did', 'only', 'mediocre', 'box', 'office', 'terrific', 'deep', 'film', 'never', 'children', 'film', 'sans', 'explosions', 'wiseass', 'children', 'idea', 'aimed', 'children', 'need', 'be', 'lesser', 'versions', 'adult', 'counterparts', 'fact', 'have', 'greater', 'charge-', 'appeal', 'kids', 'as', 'well', 'adults', 'levels', 'Children', 'films', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'ideas', 'crammed', 'children', 'can', 'absorb', 'more', 'learn', 'biases', 'fears', 'typical', 'adult', 'acquired.The', 'film', 'crisp', 'hour', 'forty-three', 'minutes', 'not', 'second', 'wasted', 'only', 'quibble', 'one', 'might', 'have', 'film', 'title', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'called', 'Secrets', 'plural', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'more', 'secret', 'Jamie', 'fate', 'involved', 'flaws', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'minor-', 'such', 'Fiona', 'repeated', 'inability', 'outwit', 'wild', 'child', 'brother', 'compared', 'film', 'virtues-', 'almost', 'else', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'one', 'Sayles', 'best', 'films', 'arguably', 'great', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'film', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'so', 'little', 'shows', 'true', 'creativity', 'matter', 'what', 'source', 'nourishment', 'when', 'creativity', 'product', 'John', 'Sayles', 'mind', 'likely', 'be', 'something', 'well', 'norm']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS

In frustration, I bought the soundtrack so I could at least listen to the beautiful music.This is a mystical tale from the British Isles. The  tale could be Irish, Welsh, Scottish, or British--it's certainly Celtic.A man discovers a seal is a &quot;silkie&quot; and one day when the  silkie slips out of her skin, he captures her. Silkies are seals with human  women inside.  They shed their skin to lie in the sun. When they do, if you  grab them before they can slip back into their skin they become your  prisioner.  All you have to do is keep the skin safely hidden and they can  not escape.After the man captures the silkie, he marries her and they  have children.  One day, the silkie figures out how to escape and return to  the sea.  Once in the sea she is lonely for her children.  She wants to  have her life in the sea and her children. This puts the children &quot;at  risk&quot; from the land people's perspective.The movie works on the  premise that a little girl is visiting her relaives and the older man tells  her the tale. The little girl being told the tale is descended from the  Silkie.

385603,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,6303820905,FYI,"[1, 1]","This beautiful film, directed by John Sayles, with his lyrical screenplay (based on a Rosalie K. Fry novel), stands the test of time. Sayles found inspiration in the poetic Celtic folklore about selkies, where seals transform into humans. I suggest using the subtitles, in order not to miss a word of the lovely dialogue. The cinematography with the characters in a luminous Irish landscape of sea, sky, seals, islands, and coast is exquisite.A young girl, Fiona, is the center of the narrative; a serious, lonely child, she is sent to live with her grandparents and cousin Eamon on the west coast of Ireland by her grief-stricken father. He is lost, part of the wave of displaced immigrants, nicknamed ""scousers"" in ports like Liverpool (scouse shortened from ""lobscouse,"" derived from a Norse fish-stew eaten by dockworkers and sailors). Jeni Courtney perfectly plays Fiona, with remarkable subtlety and nuance. She explores her new environment, longing to go out to sea with her cousin and grandfather, to see the island of Roan Inish. One afternoon, a brooding young man (the excellent actor and writer John Lynch) tells Fiona about the selkies, and regales her with the legend of how one of their common village ancestors met a mysterious woman who gave birth to the dark ones of their community; a beautiful woman (John Lynch's real-life sister, Susan Lynch, another fine actor) is really a selkie, whose babies were lulled to sleep by the sound of the sea from a special cradle, the same cradle Fiona's lost baby brother Jamie had ...Fiona learns that her family was forced to leave the magical island of Roan Inish; her kindly grandmother teaches her about cooking their traditional seaweed stew over the hearth. Once Fiona discovers Roan Inish herself, she and Eamon work hard to refurbish the abandoned cottages. She tells her family that she actually saw young Jamie running wild on the island, with only a seal for company, but no one believes her. Those who know the grief of family torn apart by strife may especially understand Fiona's drive to return to Roan Inish and search for her brother.This film is filled with gentle magic; ""Harry Potter"" has ruined little magic, the glimpse you might catch out of the corner of your eye. Such magic is in all our lives. It's still there, but if you're not looking, you might just miss it. Nowadays, many people expect to see the fantastical, like that in ""Harry Potter"" and the like, they are not looking for the little magic that actually exists. ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" is replete with little magic, love, and kindness.

It goes hand in hand with the glimpses she gets of her long-lost younger brother, who was swept out to sea one day in his wooden cradle.  Is he truly alive?

That's putting it mildly - Sayles, who is well known and respected for his film work (PASSION FISH, BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET, MATEWAN, BABY IT'S YOU, RETURN OF THE SEACAUCUS SEVEN', et al) has made a film here that, for me, will be in my top twenty for all time category.  When this film opened here in Austin, it stayed at the same theatre for months and months - and we saw it six or seven times during that period, never failing to be moved and entertained.The story of young Fiona and her little brother Jaime is one that, without any gratuitous violence or sexual content, will captivate and enthrall viewers of all ages.  The setting, on an island off the Irish coast (transported from the Scottish equivalent in the original novel) is completely thrilling and beautiful. The power of the sea, the life of the people who draw their sustenance from it and from the land, the honesty and simplicity of the characters, the mystery and magic of old tales that might or might not be true (depending on your heart) - all of these elements are combined masterfully by Sayles, and wonderfully acted by his stunning cast.  The director's love and respect for his story and characters - and for the rural Irish people and their way of life - is so very evident from this work.I'm so glad to have this film on DVD - I've had the VHS version for years, and I knew that eventually I'd wear it out.",5,"AN ASTONISHING, MOVING PIECE OF CINEMA",1053734400,"05 24, 2003",2003,1517,"['love', 'opening', 'comment', 'reviewer', 'John', 'Sayles', 'hit', 'one', 'park', 'THE', 'SECRET', 'OF', 'ROAN', 'INNISH', 'putting', 'mildly', 'Sayles', 'who', 'well', 'known', 'respected', 'film', 'work', 'PASSION', 'FISH', 'BROTHER', 'FROM', 'ANOTHER', 'PLANET', 'MATEWAN', 'BABY', 'IT', 'YOU', 'RETURN', 'THE', 'SEACAUCUS', 'SEVEN', 'et', 'al', 'made', 'film', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'top', 'twenty', 'time', 'category', 'When', 'film', 'opened', 'here', 'Austin', 'stayed', 'same', 'theatre', 'months', 'months', 'saw', 'six', 'seven', 'times', 'period', 'never', 'failing', 'be', 'moved', 'entertained.The', 'story', 'young', 'Fiona', 'little', 'brother', 'Jaime', 'one', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'sexual', 'content', 'will', 'captivate', 'enthrall', 'viewers', 'ages', 'setting', 'island', 'Irish', 'coast', 'transported', 'Scottish', 'equivalent', 'original', 'novel', 'completely', 'thrilling', 'beautiful', 'power', 'sea', 'life', 'people', 'who', 'draw', 'sustenance', 'land', 'honesty', 'simplicity', 'characters', 'mystery', 'magic', 'old', 'tales', 'might', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'true', 'depending', 'heart', 'elements', 'are', 'combined', 'masterfully', 'Sayles', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'stunning', 'cast', 'director', 'love', 'respect', 'story', 'characters', 'rural', 'Irish', 'people', 'way', 'life', 'so', 'very', 'evident', 'work.I', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'have', 'film', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'had', 'VHS', 'version', 'years', 'knew', 'eventually', ""'d"", 'wear', 'out']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS

Her mother has died and no one wants to talk about when her baby brother Jimmy drifted off to sea in his cradle.  Fiona is sent to live with her grandfather (Mick Lally) and grandmother (Eileen Colgan) on the coast across from the family's former home on the island of Roan Inish.  Everyone from her grandfather to the people she meets in towns have stories to tell young Fiona, about Roan Inish and the selkies, &quot;ceils&quot; who assume human form and can be captured if you but get their skins away from them.  Bit by bit Fiona puts the stories of her family and the local legends together until she and her cousin Eamon (Richard Sheridan) finally learn the secret of Roan Inish.Director John Sayles and cinematographer Haskell Wexler have crafted a simple story, told in leisure about a young girl who believes in her heart long before she has evidence for her eyes.  Besides any film that involves a young man having to be tied between two cows for warmth after the sea refuses to drown him is obviously a film worth seeing.  Then there all those lilting Irish accents and their wonderful way of coming up with a phrase to describe each situation.  Add to this the wonderful soundtrack of Irish music and the captivating mystery and I do not think you will have to worry that the relatively slow pace of the film will lose the interest of your children.

385623,A319KYEIAZ3SON,6303820905,Mary Whipple,"[19, 20]","Set on the west coast of Ireland, overlooking the small island of Roan Inish, this John Sayles-directed film idealizes a family's connections to the sea and celebrates their sea-faring history and culture in the face of twentieth century ""progress."" Fiona, about ten, is sent to live with her grandparents there after her mother dies and her father is too grief-stricken to care for her. Some years earlier, in the same community, Fiona's baby brother Jamie had floated out to sea in his cradle, and her father and grandfather, unable to row fast enough to rescue him, had suffered that loss, too.Fiona's participation in the seafaring life of her grandparents and cousin Eamon, exposes her to the legends and stories which have formed the backbone of her family culture. A relative tells her about ""the dark ones,"" members of her family thought to be descended from a selkie. This mermaid-like creature, part-human and part seal, is said to have borne several children by one of Fiona's ancestors before finding the hidden sealskin from which she had originally emerged. Putting on her old skin, she had obeyed the call of the sea, returning to her oceanic life and leaving her family behind.Fiona, believing that her brother Jamie is living with the seals on Roan Inish, explores the island with her cousin Eamon, searching for her roots and Jamie. Jeni Courtney as Fiona will capture your heart. A beautiful child with a sense of innocence, Courtney has an instinctive sense of how to play her role without being cute, respecting the myths she is portraying and throwing herself wholeheartedly into her role. Mick Lally and Eileen Colgan, as the grandparents, inextricably tied the island and its way of life, give a sense of gravitas to supernatural events.The cinematography (Haskell Wexler) is stunning--both interior cottage scenes and exterior scenes of the island, sea, fog, seals, and storms. Almost any shot could be freeze-framed as a portrait or landscape, its composition preserving the emotion and the meaning. The music, primarily flute, fiddle, and bodhran drum, perfectly captures the changing moods and enhances the unearthly mythology. With less gifted actors and direction, the plot of this film would be treacly fare, but Sayles, who also wrote the screenplay and did the editing, has created a brilliant film, memorializing a way of life and appealing to adults as well as younger audiences.

The power of myth is that it remains beyond our grasp, it does not enter into our world but moves outside where it has the power to instruct and inspire us. It is  within our vision but lost to our touch. The myth in Roan Inish teaches  about belonging--and though the subdued, moody cinemtography and music are  wonderful, the plotting does move too slowly. With such stunning, languid  cinematography the storyline should have had a more snappy progression. The  acting was competent but stiff on the part of almost everyone but Fiona.  The actors sounded like they were reading lines rather than letting their  own sense of magic about the tale flow into their performances. The story  itself should have been far more moving, because the idea was great and the  myth could have had a ton of poignancy. The  impact was utterly ruined by  having the family actually take the lost child back at the end. The point  was that little Fiona's belief in the myth and her dreams of little Jamie  should have been enough to get her family to return in love to Roan Inish.  They did, but the &quot;reunion&quot; destroyed the sense of wonder. Myths  should remain ethereal and above our world...they should touch us only in  our hearts and our belief in the wondrous.

385636,A3QVAKVRAH657N,6303820905,"Orrin C. Judd ""brothersjudddotcom""","[248, 272]","Given his notorious reputation for cranking out the most politically-correct of films, it's a really pleasant surprise to watch this profoundly conservative effort by John Sayles.  Based on a 1959 novel by Rosalie Fry, Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry, Sayles' Roan Inish tells the story of a young girl, Fiona, who when her mother dies is sent to live with her grandparents on the Irish coast in the years immediately after WWII.  The family had long lived on the island of Roan Inish, in the company of seals, but they were relocated to Donegal during the war and now may have to move again, further inland.  There's an ineffable sadness about the old couple, the grandfather especially misses the island and mourns the lost way of life they enjoyed; the grandmother misses Fiona's brother, Jamie, who was swept out to sea in a wooden cradle when they were moving off of Roan Inish.  Fiona though is convinced that her baby brother still lives and, indeed, her cousin Eamon tells her that he's been sighted sailing around in his cradle boat.Fiona's grandfather and cousins are only too happy to tell her tales about the family and Roan Inish, maintaining their strong ties to the island at least in memory and recitation.  Finally, one cousin, Tadhg--a ""dark one"" (dark of hair and eye like her brother was)--tells the story of how an ancestor captured a selkie, a seal-woman.  The selkies are said to swim ashore in seal form and then strip off their skins to bask in the sun as beautiful women, but if you can grab their skin before they slip away they are bound to you.  The family then is descended from this selkie, though one of her children eventually told her where to find the skin and she immediately swam off.Fiona takes to visiting the island and spots Jamie herself, running naked and picking flowers, but he runs away and sails off in his cradle. She then convinces Eamon that the seals are keeping Jamie to make the family move back to the island, so the two set about secretly restoring the dilapidated huts and gardens, all the while trying to figure out how to coax the grandparents back to Roan Inish.The film is beautifully shot, by Haskell Wexler, with a lilting Celtic soundtrack, and the cast, apparently professional but largely unknown here in the States, plays it straight down the line, as drama not fantasy.  Mr. Sayles never treats the audience as if we need convincing, nor stoops to treat the material ironically.  It is simply assumed that we will abandon reason and suspend disbelief, and we're quite happy to do so.  The whole is infused with a sentimental longing for tradition, a sense that life has a proper order and we our proper places in that order, and a disdain for change that is positively reactionary and very refreshing.  The viewer has no doubt that it is necessary for the Coneelly family, the descendants of the selkie, to live on Roan Inish and that the world is a better place with this balance restored.  It's all as anti-modern as can be and makes for a splendid old-fashioned movie experience, for the whole family or just for the adults.GRADE: A+",5,splendid old-fashioned movie experience,1033344000,"09 30, 2002",2002,3100,"['Given', 'notorious', 'reputation', 'cranking', 'out', 'most', 'politically-correct', 'films', 'really', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'watch', 'profoundly', 'conservative', 'effort', 'John', 'Sayles', 'Based', '1959', 'novel', 'Rosalie', 'Fry', 'Secret', 'Ron', 'Mor', 'Skerry', 'Sayles', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'story', 'young', 'girl', 'Fiona', 'who', 'when', 'mother', 'sent', 'live', 'grandparents', 'Irish', 'coast', 'years', 'immediately', 'WWII', 'family', 'had', 'long', 'lived', 'island', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'company', 'seals', 'were', 'relocated', 'Donegal', 'war', 'now', 'may', 'have', 'move', 'again', 'further', 'inland', 'ineffable', 'sadness', 'old', 'couple', 'grandfather', 'especially', 'island', 'lost', 'way', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'grandmother', 'Fiona', 'brother', 'Jamie', 'who', 'was', 'swept', 'out', 'sea', 'wooden', 'cradle', 'when', 'were', 'moving', 'off', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'Fiona', 'convinced', 'baby', 'brother', 'still', 'indeed', 'cousin', 'Eamon', 'been', 'sighted', 'sailing', 'around', 'cradle', 'boat.Fiona', 'grandfather', 'cousins', 'are', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'tell', 'tales', 'family', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'maintaining', 'strong', 'ties', 'island', 'least', 'memory', 'recitation', 'Finally', 'one', 'cousin', 'Tadhg', 'dark', 'one', 'dark', 'hair', 'eye', 'brother', 'was', 'story', 'how', 'ancestor', 'captured', 'selkie', 'seal-woman', 'selkies', 'are', 'said', 'swim', 'ashore', 'seal', 'form', 'then', 'strip', 'off', 'skins', 'bask', 'sun', 'beautiful', 'women', 'can', 'grab', 'skin', 'slip', 'away', 'are', 'bound', 'family', 'then', 'descended', 'selkie', 'one', 'children', 'eventually', 'told', 'where', 'find', 'skin', 'immediately', 'swam', 'off.Fiona', 'visiting', 'island', 'spots', 'Jamie', 'running', 'naked', 'picking', 'flowers', 'away', 'off', 'cradle', 'then', 'Eamon', 'seals', 'are', 'keeping', 'Jamie', 'make', 'family', 'move', 'back', 'island', 'two', 'set', 'secretly', 'restoring', 'dilapidated', 'huts', 'gardens', 'while', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'coax', 'grandparents', 'back', 'Roan', 'Inish.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'Haskell', 'Wexler', 'lilting', 'Celtic', 'soundtrack', 'cast', 'apparently', 'professional', 'largely', 'unknown', 'here', 'States', 'straight', 'down', 'line', 'drama', 'not', 'fantasy', 'Mr.', 'Sayles', 'never', 'audience', 'need', 'convincing', 'stoops', 'treat', 'material', 'ironically', 'simply', 'assumed', 'will', 'abandon', 'reason', 'suspend', 'disbelief', ""'re"", 'quite', 'happy', 'do', 'so', 'whole', 'infused', 'sentimental', 'longing', 'tradition', 'sense', 'life', 'proper', 'order', 'proper', 'places', 'order', 'disdain', 'change', 'positively', 'reactionary', 'very', 'refreshing', 'viewer', 'doubt', 'necessary', 'Coneelly', 'family', 'descendants', 'selkie', 'live', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'balance', 'restored', 'as', 'anti-modern', 'can', 'be', 'splendid', 'old-fashioned', 'movie', 'experience', 'whole', 'family', 'just', 'adults.GRADE', 'A+']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS

Flashbacks capably illustrate the unusual pedigree of Fiona's ancestors, and it's telling that child Fiona has no trouble in understanding Tadhg, while adults write him off as odd. There are excellent performances all around, including the perhaps-familiar-to-American-audiences brother-and-sister team of John and Susan Lynch (The Secret Garden,Sliding Doors,Elizabeth - The Golden Age (Widescreen Edition)) and Mick Lally (Circle of Friends,Alexander - Director's Cut (Full Screen Edition)) as Fiona's grandfather.The film's soundtrack by Mason Daring also deserves special mention. A unique blend of haunting original score, Celtic jigs, and Irish-language vocals, it captures the maritime feel of rural Ireland as well as moves the movie along through some of the more haunting dream sequences.This is a gentle film that is slow to unfold, but one that is ultimately rewarding and perfect for family viewing.",5,A modern-day Celtic folktale lovingly brought to life,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1722,"['John', 'Sayles', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish', 'based', 'short', 'storyThe', 'Secret', 'Roan', 'Inish/Movie', 'Tie-Inby', 'Rosalie', 'K.', 'Fry', 'explored', 'Celtic', 'legend', 'selkie', 'seals', 'can', 'turn', 'humans', 'Ten-year-old', 'Fiona', 'been', 'living', 'city', 'sent', 'live', 'grandparents', 'remote', 'island', 'Donegal', 'Ireland', 'mystery', 'disappearance', 'younger', 'brother', 'Jamie', 'way', 'strange', 'cousin', 'Tadhg', 'John', 'Lynch', 'who', 'story', 'selkie', 'ancestor', 'Fiona', 'consumed', 'quest', 'find', 'brother', 'whom', 'seen', 'swimming', 'seals', 'convince', 'grandparents', 'telling', 'truth.The', 'cinematography', 'craggy', 'Donegal', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'bringing', 'life', 'small', 'fishing', 'community', 'where', 'Fiona', 'family', 'Flashbacks', 'capably', 'illustrate', 'unusual', 'pedigree', 'Fiona', 'ancestors', 'telling', 'child', 'Fiona', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'Tadhg', 'adults', 'write', 'off', 'odd', 'are', 'excellent', 'performances', 'around', 'including', 'perhaps-familiar-to-American-audiences', 'brother-and-sister', 'team', 'John', 'Susan', 'Lynch', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'Sliding', 'Doors', 'Elizabeth', 'Golden', 'Age', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Mick', 'Lally', 'Circle', 'Friends', 'Alexander', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Full', 'Screen', 'Edition', 'Fiona', 'grandfather.The', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'Mason', 'Daring', 'also', 'special', 'mention', 'unique', 'blend', 'haunting', 'original', 'score', 'Celtic', 'jigs', 'Irish-language', 'vocals', 'maritime', 'feel', 'rural', 'Ireland', 'as', 'well', 'moves', 'movie', 'more', 'haunting', 'dream', 'sequences.This', 'gentle', 'film', 'slow', 'unfold', 'one', 'ultimately', 'rewarding', 'perfect', 'family', 'viewing']",Secret of Roan Inish VHS
