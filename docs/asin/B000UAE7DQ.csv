1093807,A1SD82ZAT3INZ2,B000UAE7DQ,Daniel Hayes,"[5, 5]","I read a review somewhere that tells that the second season of ""Ironside"" was weak. I wholeheartedly disagree. Mind you it started off with ""Shell Game"" which was the weakest of all the second season. It makes up with the 2 part episode ""Split Second To an Epitath"", also ""Desparate Encounter"" which is downright intense, ""I The People"" is a terrific showcase which showcases Milton Berle in a drama, and he proves he can straddle comedy, and drama, and also can write a really good script, ""Why The Tuesday Afternoon Bridge Club Met on Thursday"" is a bit hokey with a bunch of elderly ladies helping Ironside, but creating a story line where the Dr. Crippen murder from 1910 was a stroke of genius, ""Obvious Case of Guilt"" is a mindbender where you don't know what's going to happen next, ""A Drug On The Market"" is probably the most intense episode on this collection I know that when I heard the voices I was a bit spooked, and finally on Disc 7 It ends with ""Not With a Whimper, but With a Bang"".

I'd caught maybe two episodes on TV (in Texas) since the original airing by NBC, at least before Columbia House put out 20 episodes in 1999.  I was pretty sure all along that I liked Raymond Burr in IRONSIDE even better than I liked him in PERRY MASON, and I do.

Ironside, paralyzed by a would-be assassin's bullet, is back for another season of exciting and thought-provoking episodes in this award winning Classic TV Detective series. Second season episodes, from 1968, continues the high quality writing and acting that was the hallmark of this show through its five year run. Stories run the gamut from racial strife, fortune telling to the shooting of one of Ironside's team members!""Ironside"" was one of the best detective shows of the 1960s and remains a classic of its genre. Memorable characters, brilliant acting, well-crafted stories and unforgettable theme music written by the legendary Quincy Jones, ""Ironside"" brought the beloved actor Raymond Burr back to series TV after a nine year Hall of Fame portrayal of the most famous lawyer in TV history: Perry Mason. The series was created by Collier Young. The decision to make Burr disabled was remarkable for the era, as few TV leads were ever depicted as anything but able bodied and still are not.Determined not to be trapped in his wheelchair or give up his career, Ironside volunteers to work within the police department as a ""special department consultant."" Ironside drafts two young law enforcement officers, Detective Sgt. Ed Brown, portrayed by Don Galloway, and Officer Eve Whitfield, portrayed by Barbara Anderson. He also hired delinquent-turned-bodyguard Mark Sanger, portrayed by Don Mitchell, as his ""legs."" During the series, Sanger, an African-American with a chip on his shoulder and a hatred for the police, eventually went to law school and became an attorney. Ironside's consultant status was granted by Commissioner Dennis Randall, portrayed by Gene Lyons, who also frequently clashed with his long-time friend over Ironside's investigative methods and his willingness to break the rules to achieve true justice.Whitfield, who was hugely popular, left the series in 1971. Elizabeth Baur joined the cast as Officer Fran Belding and remained until the series ended in 1975, but never found the fan base that Whitfield had enjoyed.All 26 episodes remastered for DVD from the second season are included:""Shell Game,"" pits a notorious jewel thief against Ironside; ""Split Second to an Epitaph Part 1"" and ""Part II,"" Ironside is the only witness to a murder, but has to go into hospital for exploratory surgery.

A couple of standout episodes are A Matter of Love and Death,where Eve goes undercover to find an Abortionist responsible for a young Girl's death, and I the People, guest starring Milton Berle,who even wrote the episode.It was way ahead of it's time with Berle as a talk show host (much like Morton Downey Jr.)who angers a viewer enough to want to kill Him.The Tormentor,with Gary Collins,about a Blackmailer & Not With a Whimper But a Bang,with Ed Asner,about a Bomber with a grudge against a College newspaper are other standout episodes.If you're looking for a great example of TV circa 1968-69.Try Ironside.The well written plots & the banter between Ironside & His Associates make it well worth viewing.",5,Keep the Seasons coming !,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2047,"['Growing', 'up', 'watched', 'ton', 'Cop', 'shows', 'TV.S.W.A.T.', 'Baretta', 'Streets', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Rookies', 'Starsky', 'Hutch', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Columbo.Luckily', 'series', 'have', 'begun', 'make', 'way', 'DVD.On', 'Dec.18,07', '1st', 'Season', 'Vol', '1', '.Do', ""n't"", 'hate', 'when', 'season', 'broken', 'volumes', 'hate', 'Mod', 'Squad.During', 'late', ""'60's-early"", ""'70"", 'never', 'watched', 'Ironside', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'repeats', 'Ironside', 'local', 'Albany', 'NY', 'station.It', 'aired', 'early', 'Sat', 'Sun', 'mornings', '3am.I', 'watched', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'hooked.Every', 'Sat', 'Sun', 'am', 'was', 'watching', 'Ironside.Then', 'about', '5', '6', 'weeks', 'discovering', 'gem.the', 'station', 'replaced', 'Ironside', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'episodes.Soon', 'afterward', 'learned', 'upcoming', 'DVD', 'release', 'Season', '1.With', 'Raymond', 'Burr', 'lead', 'role', 'Chief', 'Robert', 'Ironside.The', 'series', 'great', 'expectations', 'Film', 'career', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'Perry', 'Mason.His', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'co-stars', 'Don', 'Galloway', 'Barbara', 'Anderson', 'Don', 'Mitchell', 'played', 'off', 'well', 'veteran', 'Burr.Taking', 'topical', 'issues', 'day', 'racism', 'abortion', 'growing', 'drug', 'culture', 'Season', '2', 'strong', 'follow', 'up', '1st.The', '2nd', 'Season', 'attracted', 'lot', 'great', 'TV', 'Film', 'Actors', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Burgess', 'Meredith', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'couple', 'standout', 'episodes', 'are', 'Matter', 'Love', 'Death', 'where', 'Eve', 'undercover', 'find', 'Abortionist', 'responsible', 'young', 'Girl', 'death', 'People', 'guest', 'starring', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'who', 'even', 'wrote', 'episode.It', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'Berle', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'much', 'Morton', 'Downey', 'Jr.', 'who', 'viewer', 'enough', 'want', 'kill', 'Him.The', 'Tormentor', 'Gary', 'Collins', 'Blackmailer', 'Not', 'Whimper', 'Bang', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Bomber', 'grudge', 'College', 'newspaper', 'are', 'other', 'episodes.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'example', 'TV', 'circa', '1968-69.Try', 'Ironside.The', 'well', 'written', 'plots', 'banter', 'Ironside', 'Associates', 'make', 'well', 'viewing']",Ironside - Season 2

I debated getting season Two, but I did and VERY GLAD I did. Season Two is MUCH better than Season One. Still a little dated but better written and much closer to the show I remember watching in the late 60's and early 70's.

1093823,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000UAE7DQ,trebe,"[1, 1]","Ex-Chief of Detectives Robert T. Ironside, is wheelchair bound after surviving an attempted assassination.  He now serves as a special consultant to the San Francisco police department.  His staff consists of detective sergeant Ed Brown (Don Galloway), officer Eve Whitfield (Barbara Anderson) and personal aide Mark Sanger (Don Mitchell).The Ironside team is like a family unit.  It couldn't exist today, and perhaps not even then, but it is the package viewers are asked to buy.  A group seldom acts and reacts as quickly as an individual, and the stories often have a deliberate pace, with Ed and Eve handling most of the legwork.  The Chief can move quickly in a crisis, but it's not how he normally operates.  Ironside has more of a thinking man's approach, looking for leads to a trail, and then following through with dogged determination.  There usually aren't a myriad of suspects to consider, and the focus is often on the episode's one or two main guest stars.The writers did a good job in the first season of establishing and building up the Ironside mystique, while also including intriguing episodes that featured the staff in some personal crisis, such as when Eve kills for the first time in the line of duty, or when Mark's date turns up dead of an overdose in a public bathroom.  Ironside himself falls in love with an amnesia victim.  With a colorful palate already established, the bar was set pretty high for season two.  And the writers respond with a nice variety of stories, blending pure crime episodes, with those with a personal angle, or off beat slant.Among the notable is `Desperate Encounter' where The Chief and Mark stumble into a dangerous situation in a small town, and Ironside demonstrates that although in a wheelchair, he is not to be underestimated.  At the time, the special relationship between Mark and The Chief was making a significant statement about race relations.  And it is explored further in `Robert Phillips vs. The Man' where Ironside must clear an Afro-American leader (Paul Winfield) of a murder charge.  Here, Mark comes full circle.  At one time he was the one looking at Ironside with distrust and scorn, now he defends him.'Reprise' is quite an interesting retrospective, as when Eve is shot, the story of how the society girl became a policewoman is revealed.  There's intrigue on the bomb squad in 'Not With a Whimper, But With a Bang', where the police are called to handle a series of bomb threats.  Funnyman Milton Berle goes way over the top as a provocative talk show host in 'I, The People'.Some of the best stories concern those with personal ties to Ironside.  In 'An Obvious Case of Guilt', Anne Baxter plays an old flame whose husband has disappeared, and Ironside is determined to solve the case no matter what.  Perhaps the best episode of season two is 'Puzzlelock', which features the format that would make Columbo a television classic.  Simon Oakland plays a friend of The Chief, who executes an intricately planned murder, and then uses Ironside as his alibi.With a little less focus on the staff's personal lives, the tenor and type of the stories in season two, continues much in the mold set in the first season.  There are a few missteps, and some episodes seem to end abruptly, but overall Season Two is quite solid.  Image quality of the 26 episodes is very good, but unfortunately like Season One, there are no extras.",4,Ironside rolls on in Season Two . . .,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",2009,3404,"['Ex-Chief', 'Detectives', 'Robert', 'T.', 'Ironside', 'wheelchair', 'surviving', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'now', 'special', 'consultant', 'San', 'Francisco', 'police', 'department', 'staff', 'detective', 'sergeant', 'Ed', 'Brown', 'Don', 'Galloway', 'officer', 'Eve', 'Whitfield', 'Barbara', 'Anderson', 'personal', 'aide', 'Mark', 'Sanger', 'Don', 'Mitchell', '.The', 'Ironside', 'team', 'family', 'unit', 'could', ""n't"", 'exist', 'today', 'perhaps', 'not', 'even', 'then', 'package', 'viewers', 'are', 'asked', 'buy', 'group', 'seldom', 'acts', 'reacts', 'as', 'quickly', 'individual', 'stories', 'often', 'have', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'Ed', 'Eve', 'handling', 'most', 'legwork', 'Chief', 'can', 'move', 'quickly', 'crisis', 'not', 'how', 'normally', 'Ironside', 'more', 'thinking', 'man', 'approach', 'looking', 'leads', 'trail', 'then', 'following', 'dogged', 'determination', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'myriad', 'suspects', 'consider', 'focus', 'often', 'episode', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'guest', 'stars.The', 'writers', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'first', 'season', 'establishing', 'building', 'up', 'Ironside', 'mystique', 'also', 'including', 'intriguing', 'episodes', 'featured', 'staff', 'personal', 'crisis', 'such', 'when', 'Eve', 'first', 'time', 'line', 'duty', 'when', 'Mark', 'date', 'up', 'dead', 'overdose', 'public', 'bathroom', 'Ironside', 'love', 'amnesia', 'victim', 'colorful', 'palate', 'already', 'established', 'bar', 'was', 'set', 'pretty', 'high', 'season', 'two', 'writers', 'respond', 'nice', 'variety', 'stories', 'blending', 'pure', 'crime', 'episodes', 'personal', 'angle', 'beat', 'slant.Among', 'notable', 'Desperate', 'Encounter', 'where', 'Chief', 'Mark', 'stumble', 'dangerous', 'situation', 'small', 'town', 'Ironside', 'wheelchair', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated', 'time', 'special', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Chief', 'was', 'making', 'significant', 'statement', 'race', 'relations', 'explored', 'further', 'Robert', 'Phillips', 'vs', 'Man', 'where', 'Ironside', 'must', 'clear', 'Afro-American', 'leader', 'Paul', 'Winfield', 'murder', 'charge', 'Here', 'Mark', 'full', 'circle', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'looking', 'Ironside', 'distrust', 'scorn', 'now', ""'Reprise"", 'quite', 'interesting', 'retrospective', 'when', 'Eve', 'shot', 'story', 'how', 'society', 'girl', 'became', 'policewoman', 'revealed', 'intrigue', 'bomb', 'squad', ""'Not"", 'Whimper', 'Bang', 'where', 'police', 'are', 'called', 'handle', 'series', 'bomb', 'threats', 'Funnyman', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'way', 'top', 'provocative', 'talk', 'show', 'host', ""People'.Some"", 'best', 'stories', 'concern', 'personal', 'ties', 'Ironside', ""'An"", 'Obvious', 'Case', 'Guilt', 'Anne', 'Baxter', 'old', 'flame', 'husband', 'disappeared', 'Ironside', 'determined', 'solve', 'case', 'matter', 'what', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'episode', 'season', 'two', ""'Puzzlelock"", 'format', 'would', 'make', 'Columbo', 'television', 'classic', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'friend', 'Chief', 'who', 'intricately', 'planned', 'murder', 'then', 'Ironside', 'alibi.With', 'little', 'less', 'focus', 'staff', 'personal', 'lives', 'tenor', 'type', 'stories', 'season', 'two', 'much', 'mold', 'set', 'first', 'season', 'are', 'few', 'missteps', 'episodes', 'seem', 'end', 'abruptly', 'overall', 'Season', 'Two', 'quite', 'solid', 'Image', 'quality', '26', 'episodes', 'very', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'extras']",Ironside - Season 2
