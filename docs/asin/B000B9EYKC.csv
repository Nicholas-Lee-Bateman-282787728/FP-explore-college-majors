This is the performance chosen by Eric himself to be released, he felt that he never played better than at this show.  Hey, who am I to argue?  This is some sick, sick, GREAT playing to be sure.  ""Cliffs of Dover"" and ""Desert Rose"" are positively inspired and incendiary.  A few sniggles, ""Trademark"" is NOT on this or the DVD, don't know why.  And Eric has about as much stage presence as Allan Greenspan.  Those are the only possible negatives, this is an unbelievable live performance and anyone who wants to hear truly great guitar needs to own this.

938289,A2BBJL4I0G1GYC,B000B9EYKC,"Brandon Stanley ""bls2182""","[7, 11]","Aside from an appearance on the first G3 DVD (Vai, Satriani, Johnson), EJ has never properly had his own concert DVD. Until now, that is. This is a performance from Austin City Limits in 1988, and Eric & his friends Kyle Brock and Tommy Taylor perform a set that ranges from impressive to almost sloppy. This is not due to any fault of the rhythm section; in fact, the drums/bass are always perfect, and Mr. Brock even plays a nice ""solo"" at one point.My biggest gripe with this performance is that Eric gets into noodling WAY too often on this program, and as a result it tends to hurt, rather than hinder the music. He possesses an incredible range of skills, and frequently improvises a number of chord changes, ""harp harmonics"" and even some two-handed hammer effects (all technical guitar stuff). This is all fine, except that Eric will often lose the tempo of the song at inappropriate moments, and wander off into improvisations that seem more disasterous than adventurous. I'm familiar with a great deal of improvised jazz, rock, and other styles of music, so I feel that I can safely say that the faults I have observed are valid.Another problem I have is with Eric's voice on this particular recording. Although many people hate EJ's singing, I rather like it. However, whether it is due to improper mic'ing or something else, the vocals just aren't very effective here. His voice is too smooth and subdued to even ATTEMPT a song like Jimi Hendrix's classic ""Love or Confusion"", and here the lyrics are muddy and incomprehensible. The guitar playing is masterful, but the voice doesn't come anywhere close in terms of quality.Having voiced these complaints, I will say that the audio mix is mostly good from the stereo mix I heard (my DVD player doesn't allow access to the DTS mix). The video quality is very nice for an 18 year old recording, and we manage to see very nice shots of Eric's fingers dancing on the fretboard.The song selection is good, overall, and we get to see and hear music that would not appear on any of his albums for some time at the point the show was recorded. For example, ""Camel's Night Out"" did not appear on an album until 1996, but unfortunately it is very uneven and sloppy when compared to the studio and G3 performances of this song. Cliffs of Dover also appears here, in a slightly less focused rendition than would appear on Ah Via Musicom in 1990.I think that the problem is that Eric, despite his incredible talent, has difficulty ""feeling"" the songs, especially in a live setting. He is a notorious perfectionist, so I can understand why he has only released one live album to date.The bottom line is that, even with the faults, most fans will overlook them and enjoy what they see. Eric Johnson is among the most gifted musicians living today, and deserves the praise received from the reviewers on this page. I only wish that a more focused performance could have been released on DVD, perhaps something more recent, like the Alien Love Child or Acoustic shows of the last 5-6 years? Until then, this is the best, and only, Eric Johnson concert available on DVD.",4,"Good, Yet Far From Stellar",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,3114,"['Aside', 'appearance', 'first', 'G3', 'DVD', 'Vai', 'Satriani', 'Johnson', 'EJ', 'never', 'properly', 'had', 'own', 'concert', 'DVD', 'now', 'performance', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', '1988', 'Eric', 'friends', 'Kyle', 'Brock', 'Tommy', 'Taylor', 'perform', 'set', 'impressive', 'almost', 'sloppy', 'not', 'due', 'fault', 'rhythm', 'section', 'fact', 'drums/bass', 'are', 'always', 'perfect', 'Mr.', 'Brock', 'even', 'nice', 'solo', 'one', 'point.My', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'performance', 'Eric', 'noodling', 'WAY', 'too', 'often', 'program', 'result', 'hurt', 'rather', 'hinder', 'music', 'incredible', 'range', 'skills', 'frequently', 'number', 'chord', 'changes', 'harp', 'harmonics', 'even', 'two-handed', 'hammer', 'effects', 'technical', 'guitar', 'stuff', 'fine', 'Eric', 'will', 'often', 'lose', 'tempo', 'song', 'inappropriate', 'moments', 'wander', 'off', 'improvisations', 'seem', 'more', 'disasterous', 'adventurous', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'great', 'deal', 'improvised', 'jazz', 'rock', 'other', 'styles', 'music', 'feel', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'faults', 'have', 'observed', 'are', 'valid.Another', 'problem', 'have', 'Eric', 'voice', 'particular', 'recording', 'many', 'people', 'hate', 'EJ', 'singing', 'rather', 'However', 'due', 'improper', ""mic'ing"", 'something', 'else', 'vocals', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'effective', 'here', 'voice', 'too', 'smooth', 'subdued', 'even', 'ATTEMPT', 'song', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'classic', 'Love', 'Confusion', 'here', 'lyrics', 'are', 'muddy', 'incomprehensible', 'guitar', 'playing', 'masterful', 'voice', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'close', 'terms', 'quality.Having', 'voiced', 'complaints', 'will', 'say', 'audio', 'mix', 'mostly', 'good', 'stereo', 'mix', 'heard', 'DVD', 'player', ""n't"", 'allow', 'access', 'DTS', 'mix', 'video', 'quality', 'very', 'nice', '18', 'year', 'old', 'recording', 'manage', 'see', 'very', 'nice', 'shots', 'Eric', 'fingers', 'dancing', 'fretboard.The', 'song', 'selection', 'good', 'overall', 'get', 'see', 'hear', 'music', 'would', 'not', 'appear', 'albums', 'time', 'point', 'show', 'was', 'recorded', 'example', 'Camel', 'Night', 'Out', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'album', '1996', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'uneven', 'sloppy', 'when', 'compared', 'studio', 'G3', 'performances', 'song', 'Cliffs', 'Dover', 'also', 'here', 'slightly', 'less', 'focused', 'rendition', 'would', 'appear', 'Ah', 'Via', 'Musicom', '1990.I', 'think', 'problem', 'Eric', 'incredible', 'talent', 'difficulty', 'feeling', 'songs', 'especially', 'live', 'setting', 'notorious', 'perfectionist', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'only', 'released', 'one', 'live', 'album', 'date.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'even', 'faults', 'most', 'fans', 'will', 'overlook', 'enjoy', 'what', 'see', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'most', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'living', 'today', 'praise', 'received', 'reviewers', 'page', 'only', 'wish', 'more', 'focused', 'performance', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'perhaps', 'something', 'more', 'recent', 'Alien', 'Love', 'Child', 'Acoustic', 'shows', 'last', '5-6', 'years', 'then', 'best', 'only', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'concert', 'available', 'DVD']",N/A

I know this performance well, because I have treasured my VHS recording of the PBS version for over 15 years.  This is Eric during his Ah Via Musicom years, and he is really at his best from a playing standpoint. I saw this by chance while channel surfing back in 89, and I had no idea what I was in for.  Seeing Eric live (on video) for the first time is one of a handful of great moments of guitar fandom that I have ever experienced.  I obviously can't make any comments about the video or sound quality of this transfer, but I expect that they will be decent because the original broadcast quality was very good considering the standard media used then.  This is what most Eric Johnson fans have been waiting for: a complete set on DVD quality video.  He has appeared on various other compilation DVDs like G3 and the Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD, but this is the first set length DVD he has appeared on. There are a decent variety of tunes from that time period, mostly from Ah Via Musicom with a few Hendrix covers and some tracks form his Tones release.

Like fellow Texan (now no longer of this earth), Stevie Ray Vaughn, Mr. Johnson can seemingly play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously. I would like to see the video to understand how he accomplishes this. (And I did see him live at the kick-off concert in Denver of his tour with Joe Satriani a few months ago. It was superb, but they only let him play for one hour.) His transitions between various tones are seamless and masterful. His solos are fluid, firey, and always well thought out. There is no shredding for shreedding sake here. Mr. Johnson is far too tasteful for that kind of exhibitionism. (I won't name names.)Mr. Johnson is supported strongly by bass and drums. His singing is sparse and not annoying, although not on the level of his playing. (Who could expect that?) The Hendrix covers are superb.

He is absolutely on fire in this set and you can't help but feel your jaw drop as you watch him play!  I remember years ago when I was visiting my brother in Austin...I saw Eric at Threadgills-a popular Austin eatery..he was having dinner by himself and I wanted so much to approach him and ask for his autograph but did not want to interrupt his meal..I have never seen him perform live but this comes pretty close..For anyone who is into guitars..this is a must see!",5,A gifted guitarist...,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1168,"['have', 'always', 'loved', 'following', 'great', 'guitar', 'players', 'have', 'been', 'fan', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'years', 'remember', 'picking', 'up', 'Eric', 'Tones', 'CD', 'years', 'ago', 'being', 'blown', 'away', 'inspired', 'guitar', 'playing', 'One', 'favorite', 'CDs', 'Eric', 'masterpiece', 'Ah', 'Via', 'Musicom', 'day', 'treasure', 'along', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Blow', 'Blow', 'finest', 'guitar', 'music', 'ever', 'recorded', 'can', 'imagine', 'when', 'heard', 'Eric', '1988', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'appearance', 'was', 'DVD', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'get', 'hold', 'had', 'heard', 'years', 'was', 'must', 'see', 'never', 'got', 'actually', 'seeing', 'now', 'Was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'one', 'unbelievable', 'DVD', 'Eric', 'peak', 'absolutely', 'fire', 'set', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'jaw', 'drop', 'watch', 'play', 'remember', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', 'visiting', 'brother', 'Austin', 'saw', 'Eric', 'Threadgills-a', 'popular', 'Austin', 'eatery..he', 'was', 'having', 'dinner', 'wanted', 'so', 'much', 'approach', 'ask', 'autograph', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'interrupt', 'meal..I', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'perform', 'live', 'pretty', 'close..For', 'anyone', 'who', 'guitars..this', 'must', 'see']",N/A

I didn't even know it was coming out on DVD but I ran into this tonight at the music store and it made my day. I'm already on my second time through watching it.I've seen EJ 5 times since 1990 and this definitely captures his live playing on a better night. The only thing missing is a light show and rowdy fans. This crowd is about as excited as some senior citizens watching a high-school play.This is right before Ah Via Musicom came out and is arguably around the creative peak of his career. There isn't a bad song on here. The thing I like about his playing on this performance and live in general is that he improvises some of the solos, adds measures and sections to songs and really cuts loose. He gets in the zone and plays what he is feeling.A few of the gems on this include:Trail of Tears: Absolutely beautiful intro and powerful playing, especially at the end. I love his chordings on this song.Western Flyer: Never heard this fusiony song before. Great groove and different chordings.Emerald Eyes: He doesn't play this live usually. He spices this up a bit from the album.Cliffs of Dover: The intro solo he plays is pretty cool and is the basis of many of his live solos.Both Hedrix tunes are pretty cool. EJ knows how to play Jimi true to form but add his own embellishments to it.The sound quality and mixing seems pretty good on Stereo PCM, although I'm watching through my computer because I'm on the road. The video is decent in terms of camera angles and panning. It doesn't do an MTV where it switches angles every 3 seconds so you can't see him play things.If you are an EJ fan, or even if you just want to see some great guitar playing you must buy this now.",5,This performance represents Eric's playing,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1757,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'heard', 'legendary', 'performance', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'was', 'coming', 'out', 'DVD', 'ran', 'tonight', 'music', 'store', 'made', 'day', ""'m"", 'already', 'second', 'time', 'watching', 'it.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'EJ', '5', 'times', '1990', 'definitely', 'live', 'playing', 'better', 'night', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'light', 'show', 'rowdy', 'fans', 'crowd', 'as', 'excited', 'senior', 'citizens', 'watching', 'high-school', 'play.This', 'right', 'Ah', 'Via', 'Musicom', 'came', 'out', 'arguably', 'creative', 'peak', 'career', ""n't"", 'bad', 'song', 'here', 'thing', 'like', 'playing', 'performance', 'live', 'general', 'solos', 'measures', 'sections', 'songs', 'really', 'cuts', 'loose', 'zone', 'what', 'feeling.A', 'few', 'gems', 'include', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'Absolutely', 'beautiful', 'intro', 'powerful', 'playing', 'especially', 'end', 'love', 'chordings', 'song.Western', 'Flyer', 'Never', 'heard', 'fusiony', 'song', 'Great', 'groove', 'different', 'chordings.Emerald', 'Eyes', ""n't"", 'play', 'live', 'usually', 'up', 'bit', 'album.Cliffs', 'Dover', 'intro', 'solo', 'pretty', 'cool', 'basis', 'many', 'live', 'solos.Both', 'Hedrix', 'tunes', 'are', 'pretty', 'cool', 'EJ', 'how', 'play', 'Jimi', 'true', 'form', 'add', 'own', 'embellishments', 'it.The', 'sound', 'quality', 'mixing', 'pretty', 'good', 'Stereo', 'PCM', ""'m"", 'watching', 'computer', ""'m"", 'road', 'video', 'decent', 'terms', 'camera', 'angles', 'panning', ""n't"", 'do', 'MTV', 'where', 'angles', '3', 'seconds', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'play', 'things.If', 'are', 'EJ', 'fan', 'even', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'great', 'guitar', 'playing', 'must', 'buy', 'now']",N/A

The sound is great, and the final result is an oustanding collection of songs played inside (what it seems to be) a T.V. studio night program with almost uncheering people (How they dare?). As a matter of fact, the performance was cut and edited for its distribution, and this is my complain about it. Why not all the songs?An observation (maybe the less important) is about the image of the group. It's opposite to the kind of music that band plays. There's a lack of uniformity in the wardrobe: Eric johnson was wearing a good looking dark blue jacket (a la Jimi Hendrix style) and the rest of the band was wearing clothes with country motives (?). The Bass drum had it too (?): It's not about fashion because I like Country Music, it's about structure, uniformity and musical forms... in the G3 concert, Eric Johnson with his brother playing bass, gave us another image of the band. A real uniformity...But Foremost of whichever thing, and the better, is that there is a lot of freedom in the musicianship of the performance. Eric plays with a big amount of confidence and a high level of musicianship showing all his classic guitar trademarks. The bassist plays a kind of a country style instrumental that introduces some different air in the presentation. But the better songs are those of the AH VIA MUSICOM album. This performance is a jewel for the real fan and for the neophyte musician, and the music really makes worthwhile the price to pay!... So Good Luck!",4,"Interesting...

I have to suspect that Eric hadn't discovered girls yet, in order to play that brilliantly!! In other words, he must have spent a lot of time, especially in the mind-boggling ""speed"" department!Of course I'm joking about the ""girls"" bit, I say that about all truly great musicians.I can't really make any critisisms about this concert, however, it would have been nice to have say, a rhythm guitar, Hammond keys, or a Rhodes behind him, but still, it's great!Finally, after watching the concert, I read the liner notes, and was delighted to see that he mentioned Jeff Beck,(my favorite guitarist, who even influenced Jimi to a certain extent- don't believe me?, then do your research!!), as one of his three major influences, which includes Jimi, of course. Jeff doesn't have that unbelievable speed picking, (up and down the neck), he doesn't use a pick for starters, but he's one of those people who only fully displays his remarkable brilliance ""in concert"", and does so intentionally.But this review is about Eric, (who's probably somewhat of a friend of Jeff's anyway), and Eric is so incredible throughout, that he even manages to imitate Jimi Hendrix's ""reverse, backwards-taped recorded"" guitar from ""Are You Experienced"", without any ""backwards"" effects, no less!!

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[57, 57]","If you have even the slightest interest in the playing of an electric guitar you absolutely MUST check out this DVD.Eric Johnson fans have been circulating old VHS copies of this for decades.  EJ has appeared on ""Austin City Limits"" as often as any performer - perhaps helped by being from that town, although I don't recall seeing other Texans appearing nearly as often.  Austin City Limits is one of the most treasured live-music shows in American History.  Madonna and Britney Spears and other over-hyped lip-syncing media sell-outs can hog up the mainstream airways as much as they like - all Austin City Limits performers have artistic heft that can't be faked.This 1988 performance is dated by Eric's ""Flock of Seagulls"" hairdo and Sergeant Pepper/Michael Jackson/John Phillip Sousa jacket.  But the music is timeless.  Eric joins his perfectly supporting 2-man bass and drums combo to blow our minds. The now-platinumAh Via Musicomhad just been released and it is fair to say he was ""peaking"".  A known perfectionist in the studio, he would record tracks over and over and over again until they were ""just right"" and I saw in an interview that he simply didn't think he could play better than on that recording.  That being said, he doesn't have the opportunity to ""redo"" on this live performance, but as he unleashes the most overwhelming guitar technique ever known it doesn't really matter, does it?  The man is a force of nature in this performance.  Best of all - the DVD features crystal clarity in both the picture and audio.  Every one of his flood of notes rings like a bell.""Musicom"" cuts like ""Steve's Boogie"" and ""Desert Rose"" surround his performance of perhaps the most incredible instrumental in rock history ""Cliffs of Dover"".  He also covers some Hendrix and ""Are You Experienced?"" makes us remember the left-handed master while marveling at Hendrix' able successor.The album-oriented rock airwaves have been flooded for decades with speed demons who race up and down their stratocasters without a thought for tone or note selection.  Here is where Eric Johnson completely shines: although as fast as Vai or Malmsteen, Mr. Johnson is as thoughtful and careful in his note selection as Clapton or Louis Armstrong.

938306,A1A1MEASBX3J5G,B000B9EYKC,Slo-Hand,"[1, 1]","My favorite songs on this DVD are 'East Wes', 'Cliffs of Dover', and 'Zap' because of exceptional guitar work. 'Desert Rose' has an outstanding instrumental part and 'Camel's Night Out' is also noteworthy . He plays with intensity with an arsenal of vintage pedals. 'East Wes' has a hint of the thumb strummed Montgomery octaves and some well executed artificial harmonics but mostly it's just a beautiful piece of guitar music. This live version of 'Cliffs of Dover' differs significantly from the recorded version. It's more of a Malmsteen influenced approach preferring the monster run to the super precise lick of the recording. There are even minor flubs in this version which Eric seems to be slightly embarrassed about. The way Eric plays with technical proficiency and nuance is a tough act for any guitarist to follow.  Another point to remember is the tone he so meticulously achieves. I'd call it 'articulated bagpipes'. I wonder if 'Line 6' has modeled him yet ? Starting with his Strat; point one is the 12 inch radius neck. It's not your typical stratocaster neck. It's more of a jazz neck,(flatter and wider than a typical 9 1/2 inch radius strat neck}. It sounds nothing like a strat to my ears. He  uses just a little bit of distortion preferring the true tone of his guitar and amps speaking of which,(the guitar) has the thinnest of finishes so the tone of the wood can come through. This is atypical of your typical strat which has multiple layers of lacquer on the body and neck muting the instruments tone. He uses vintage 1950's electronics and pick-ups because many modern pick-ups are either heavily waxed or in the case of noiseless pickups,(actually thin humbucking pick-ups). They also rob tone,(remember strats are noise cancelling naturally in positions 2 and 4 so noiseless pickups are not really necessary. To go a giant step further Eric uses no ground connections on his amps or effects because he believes they invite dirty power,(also electricution).High end AC power conditioners/regenerators supposedly accomplish the same thing but they retail for over two thousand bucks a piece, are heavy(90lbs) and have amperage limits(usually 800), so he'd need 4 or 5 of them. His effect pedals must be at a certain height and I'm sure he would use battery power if it were feasable,(for his amplification). He loves the dynamic of shifting from shimmering classical sounding chords back to his signature lead tone ... this device is used in 'Cliffs' to nice effect(lactic acid break?). The bass player is given a short solo( C.W.) which leads into 'Camel's Night Out'. 'C.W.' is a cliched lick repeated at fast tempo with some variation. I did not hear quite ENOUGH variation in that riffage to spark my interest. From a compositional standpoint it could have been fleshed out more but if all he got was a minute, perhaps there's only so much you can do in that timeframe. He's no Jaco but he ain't shabby either. I had a similar reaction to 'Steve's Boogie' which again sounded truncated and lacking. I hear Eric has learned to have more fun on stage since this recording.
