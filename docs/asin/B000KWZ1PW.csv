A trimmed down version of the Super Bowl to the point where it seems like only highlights. Previous versions had what appeared to be the entire game. This was a huge disappointment.2. An NFL Films retrospective of the entire Colts season. If you are not familiar with their work, NFL Films not only show key plays and make commentary, they usually get down on the field and give you an idea of the conversations going on between officials, coaches, and the players themselves.3. A trimmed down version of the AFC Championship Game.4. Wired segments have the on-field conversation of  Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison, and a ""Best of Patriots/Colts"" wired segment.5. A short piece on Media Day.6. A behind-the-scenes look at the Super Bowl including all the preparations involved, plus the Cirque du Soleil pre-game show and the post-game show.7. There is a profile piece on Tony Dungy and another on linebacker Gary Brackett. Both have compelling stories, and I did find these pieces interesting, just as I thought I would.8. Two additional short pieces entitled ""Practice with Tony Dungy"" and ""Just Snap the Ball"".9. The halftime show appears to be missing unless I've skipped over it somehow in viewing.In summary, I just don't think the Colts got the respect they deserved based on previous Championship DVDs I have viewed that had the entire Super Bowl game including the halftime show. Last year's championship DVD in particular was excellent. I was quite upset and would change my rating from five stars to three stars if it were possible - it's not. Did we get shortchanged because the Colts weren't expected to win??? I only wish I had a more fitting tribute to the contest.",5,I thought it would be excellent...it isn't,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1779,"['Based', 'delivered', 'product', 'can', 'now', 'tell', 'what', 'DVD', 'news', 'not', 'good.1', 'trimmed', 'down', 'version', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'point', 'where', 'only', 'highlights', 'Previous', 'versions', 'had', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'entire', 'game', 'was', 'huge', 'disappointment.2', 'NFL', 'Films', 'retrospective', 'entire', 'Colts', 'season', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'work', 'NFL', 'Films', 'not', 'only', 'show', 'key', 'plays', 'make', 'commentary', 'usually', 'get', 'down', 'field', 'give', 'idea', 'conversations', 'going', 'officials', 'coaches', 'players', 'themselves.3', 'trimmed', 'down', 'version', 'AFC', 'Championship', 'Game.4', 'Wired', 'segments', 'have', 'on-field', 'conversation', 'Peyton', 'Manning', 'Marvin', 'Harrison', 'Best', 'Patriots/Colts', 'wired', 'segment.5', 'short', 'piece', 'Media', 'Day.6', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'including', 'preparations', 'involved', 'Cirque', 'du', 'Soleil', 'pre-game', 'show', 'post-game', 'show.7', 'profile', 'piece', 'Tony', 'Dungy', 'linebacker', 'Gary', 'Brackett', 'have', 'compelling', 'stories', 'did', 'find', 'pieces', 'interesting', 'just', 'thought', 'would.8', 'Two', 'additional', 'short', 'pieces', 'entitled', 'Practice', 'Tony', 'Dungy', 'Just', 'Snap', 'Ball', '.9', 'halftime', 'show', 'be', 'missing', ""'ve"", 'skipped', 'somehow', 'viewing.In', 'summary', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Colts', 'got', 'respect', 'deserved', 'based', 'previous', 'Championship', 'DVDs', 'have', 'viewed', 'had', 'entire', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'game', 'including', 'halftime', 'show', 'Last', 'year', 'championship', 'DVD', 'particular', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'quite', 'upset', 'would', 'change', 'rating', 'five', 'stars', 'three', 'stars', 'were', 'possible', 'not', 'Did', 'get', 'shortchanged', 'Colts', 'were', ""n't"", 'expected', 'win', 'only', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'contest']",NFL Super Bowl XLI - Indianapolis Colts Championship
1035680,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B000KWZ1PW,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[0, 1]","The Indianapolis Colts, after several years of playoff frustration and high expectations, finally won a Super Bowl , Super Bowl XLI. This highlights package, which has been done annually for several years now, is not one of the better efforts by NFL Films. I am sure Indianapolis Colts fans will greatly enjoy reliving the long awaited championship season and want this as a keepsake. The regular season highlights are mostly well done, the playoff highlights are of mixed quality, while the Super Bowl highlights were very good but lacking a bit in the emotional buildup and suspense that makes these highlight packages a delight for fans. And the biggest disappointment is the package does not have the full game on it like some of the previous years. In fact, the bonus features are not that good in general. The montages that are in the bonus features are short and not very informative or revealing.As with other DVDs in this series, the main feature is an hour or so long highlight reel of the Indianapolis Colts 2006 season, including highlights of every regular season and playoff game, with extensive highlights of the Super Bowl. The highlights, however, only do an average job of really building the suspense and emotion of the season. It simply lacked the kind of emotional drama and tension I have come to expect in these highlight packages. It also lacked very many close-up on the field shots that bring the action up close and personal as did previous videos in this series.Another key drawback to this production is a lack of completeness obscuring the real story behind the games by leaving out key details. Generally that is a complaint you can make about all the video highlight packages like this the NFL produces. In the short time span allotted to each game, important plays and turning points are often left out. In this video, however, there is one game in particular where it leaves the viewer with a false impression of what really happened in the game, and this is the highlights of the Colts' first round playoff victory 23-8 over the Kansas City Chiefs. The story this video shows is only half correct - the Colts defense stepped up and shut down one of the most potent running attacks (and offenses) in the league, holding Kansas City running back Larry Johnson to only 32 yards rushing. On the other hand, it made the Colts offense look like it had a great game, extolling the virtues of Peyton Manning and the offense. Almost nothing was said about Manning's three interceptions and the general sloppiness and inconsistency of the offense. Yes, the key story was the Colts defense, but without pointing out the shakiness of the offense in its first 2007 playoff game it was simply an inaccurate portrayal of the game. As an historical record of the Colts run to the Super Bowl, I find this egregious.As noted, this highlights package is average, at best, but there are some good things about it too. The opening montage has a few nicely understated interviews about the Colts heartbreaking losses in the playoffs the last three seasons, twice to the New England Patriots and last year to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The best and most revealing interview was with Jim Irsay, owner of the Colts, who said before the season (paraphrased): ""We don't want our legacy to be one of the best teams to never win a championship. Our legacy has yet to be determined."" That was a great summation of the position the Colts found themselves in in 2007.The highlights package also does a job of chronicling the Colts mid to late season breakdown in defense, becoming the regular season team giving up the most rushing yardage, and how this could not continue in the playoffs if they expected to make a championship run. It then showed how the defense really turned it around in the playoffs shutting down some powerful running attacks, helping propel the Colts into the Super Bowl. And of course Peyton Manning is the star of the show, but kudos to the highlights package for featuring the outstanding play of the offensive line, rookie running back Joseph Addai, receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne, tight end Dallas Clark, as well as the impact the return of safety Bob Sanders from an injury had on the defense. It was excellent in its well rounded treatment of the team when it could very well have been a Peyton Manning highlight reel given the media attention he garners.The 29-17 Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl victory over the Chicago Bears was generally well done but lacked the same emotional drama as the rest of the highlight reel. But it did show one awesome play that this video needed more of. It showed a close up of safety Bob Sanders before the snap, then him rushing toward Cedric Benson, the Chicago running back, and making a picture perfect hit, tackle, and forced fumble. It was a beautiful play and an outstanding piece of camera work and editing. If I were a Colts fan that would have gotten me really pumped. Too bad there wasn't more of this type of action throughout.The Bonus materials were mostly a complete waste of time. It might be the worst I've seen yet in these Super Bowl highlight packages. First, as noted earlier, it didn't have the full game broadcast on it which is a big strike against it for me. It also featured the NFL Network Postgame show which was talking heads (mostly Jim Mora, former Colts head coach) saying not much of anything, and no real analysis of the game. There is a heartwarming profile of Colts linebacker Gary Brackett who lost both his parents within four months of each other, and his brother of leukemia about a year later after he donated bone marrow to him, as well as a profile of coach Tony Dungy. There are a few wired for sound segments of Manning, Harrison, and games against the Patriots which were okay but nothing special. The two quick segments on Peyton Manning's well known antics behind the line of scrimmage before snapping the ball and how Tony Dungy runs practice were also okay but uninformative to the avid football fan. There is a more extensive highlights package of the Colts versus Patriots AFC Championship game which offers more thorough highlights of the game than appears in the main highlights package, but suffers from the same lack of game analysis and drama as the rest of the video. And of course there is the obligatory shots of a few Colts players and Tony Dungy being interviewed during Media Day, which didn't elicit much really, although the interview with defensive tackle Anthony McFarland talking about Tony Dungy's coaching style was interesting.Finally, while I could care less about half time shows or pre-game shows, at first I was baffled that the bonus materials included the dreadful Cirque Du Soleil pre-game show, but not the Prince halftime show which I actually found entertaining. But then I realized that Prince slipped in a phallic symbol during the show (and yes I'm pretty sure he did it, and did it on purpose) and that's why it's not on the DVD.Despite the many drawbacks, I am sure Colts fans will find this very entertaining as they relive a great, well deserved championship season. Congratulations to the Colts for a great season.DISCLAIMER: I am an avid New England Patriots fan and this video actually made me want to puke. But it did not affect my review of the video. The fact I didn't break down in tears or break any furniture during the highlights of the AFC Championship game is evidence enough of the general lack of drama building and emotional tension of the presentation.",3,Peyton Manning Finally Wins the Big One,1237593600,"03 21, 2009",2009,7533,"['Indianapolis', 'Colts', 'several', 'years', 'playoff', 'frustration', 'high', 'expectations', 'finally',

I'm very disappointed in this DVD package with what is essentially a 75 minute video of the Colts' Super Bowl season of which 20 minutes or so are related to their four playoff games with the Chiefs, Ravens, Pats and Bears.  It didn't even have the NFL Films Game of the Week of the Super Bowl (had to buy that one from iTunes).  The extras are nothing special other than the Game of the Week  for the win against the Pats in the AFC Championship (and that is only a 22 minute version).I'm guessing that they wanted to get something out there ASAP after the Super Bowl and pulled things together very quickly.  Hopefully there will be a more comprehensive set (Like was done with the Steelers last year), but my hopes aren't high as I'm guessing there is a perception that sales will not be great given that Indy is a ""small market"" team.I wish a package would come out with the complete games of all the Colts playoff games (like they have been doing with the World Series' every year).
