This is a show that I and probably every other Goolie fan doubted would EVER be released on DVD.  For those who are unfamiliar with the show, it is a horrific spoof on classic Universal Monsters combined with the TV show Laugh In.  It has extraordinary characterizations of Frankie, Wolfie, Drac and an assorted bunch of offbeat characters with comedic voice-overs by Larry Storch, Howard Morris and many other notables.  I mean who can forget Ratso and Batso and the ever annoying Hauntleroy?  Some of my most cherished childhood memories of Saturday morning television are due to this show, I never missed an episode.  They may not hold up well over time but true afficionados of 70's pop culture will surely have a monsterous flashback of better days.

The animation is horribly limited, obviously executed on a stingy corporate budget, but the animated personalities are very expansive. One of the best aspects about this series as an adult is not the painful puns slung end over end Laugh In style, but the voice characterizations. Where the animation leaves me vastly disappointed now, the voice acting is really a howl (sorry).

Groovie Goolies-The Saturday Mourning Collection. This 3 disc set includes 16 episodes of the cult classic cartoon series. The wacky series premiered in 1970. If you have child hood memories of this show you may think it was a figment of your imagination. I'm here to tell you it was very real. The Groovie Goolies were a band of some of the most famous monster characters in history. Frankenstein, The Mummy, Dracula, and The Wolfman were just a few of the classic characters brought to life with new names like Frankie, Wolfie and Drac.The gang of gouls would have little adventures and then break out into cute songs like ""Monster Cookbook,"" and ""1,2,3."" The songs were very catchy and the DVD producers knew the songs were important to the fans so they even added an option where you can sing a long with the songs. The songs included in each episodes are also listed on the DVD box.Disc one includes 6 episodes (with commentary for the first two episodes), disc two includes 6 episodes also and disc 3 includes 4 episodes and the special features. The box set also includes a color booklet that includes show history information.Special Features-Goolians-A Docu-ComedyHosted by Wally Wingert, Daniel Roebuck featuring interviews with Alice Cooper, Forrest J.

1021306,A3B1GE37ASB8OL,B000ILYYD0,"J. Rose ""jrccw""","[32, 33]","The episodes always began in the same fashion: On a stormy night, a disembodied voice welcomes us to an obviously haunted yet strangely colorful castle called Horrible Hall.  A vampire bat flies across a full moon and attempts to enter a window, which inexplicably moves, causing the bat to crash into the stone wall, revert to vampire form, and fall to the ground.  The vampire looks at the viewer and gripes, ""This place is driving me BATTY!""The vampire, of course, was Count Drac, one of the hosts of Filmation's GROOVIE GOOLIES, a 1970's favorite which is the latest new release under BCI's Ink & Paint brand.  This cartoon, a spin-off of the then-popular THE ARCHIE SHOW and originally paired with the adventures of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH, is a long-awaited release that has finally come to DVD in a package featuring the complete series on 3 discs.An exponent of the classic Universal Monsters craze that began in the 1960's (and was still going strong in the '70's), GROOVIE GOOLIES was a gang of friendly, rock-and-roll-playing monsters whose adventures acted as a sort of monsterized kids' version of ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN, following almost the same format right down to the wall of windows (here christened ""Weird Window Time"") where the characters told jokes and one-liners.  In addition to Drac, the other Goolies were Frankie (the friendly, sweetly goofy Frankenstein's Monster), Wolfie (a hip, surfing, hot-rod-driving, practical-joking Werewolf), Mummy, Boneapart (a skeleton who fell apart as often as not), the sexy Vampira-inspired Bella LaGhostley, wacky witch-cook Hagatha, and a host of others.  Sabrina makes appearances as well, along with some of the other characters from her show (which deserves its own release as a companion to this set, as the Goolies originated on SABRINA).  The pacing of each episode is frenetic, which helps with some of the humor; many of the jokes are enormously corny, but the delivery and speed with which they are told makes them funny, and the character voices are top-notch talent, featuring Howard Morris and Larry Storch doing most of the characters.Each episode also featured fun, cute and funky soft-rock songs that were usually somehow related to the show (two per episode), and the Goolies actually scored a Top Ten hit during the '70's with ""Chick-A-Boom,"" which is also here.  The episodes have been well restored, with vibrant color, and the artwork, which Filmation has usually excelled at, really stands out.Extras include commentary for two episodes, featuring Lou Schemier (head of Filmation during its run),historian Darrel McNeil, monster expert Bob Burns and GOOLIES head writer Jack Mendelsohn, hosted by voice-over artist Wally Wingert.  Wingert also appears as one of the stars of a ""docu-comedy"" called GOOLIANS, which combines documentary material with a sitcom format.  In this feature (which runs almost like a GOOLIES episode) Wingert and fellow Goolian Daniel Roebuck (of LOST), both self-confessed monster freaks, are sent on a mission to gather information about the Groovie Goolies to cure their classic monster fixation.  From my point of view, there isn't anything wrong with a classic monster fixation, but along the way we hear from Mendelsohn, Schemier, Alice Cooper (who originated the monsters/rock music connection), Ron Chaney (grandson of Lon Jr.), Forrest J. Ackerman (ex-FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND publisher) and more, so maybe it's a good thing.If you're looking for a way to introduce your kids to the idea that sometimes scary can be fun, grab this set; it's a great Halloween treat and a wonderful return visit from some old fiends.

Being a huge fan of the Universal monsters and spoofs like The Munsters, a cartoon like this is right up my alley(and maybe yours).  There's really no plot to this show.  It's a bunch of assorted monsters hanging out at a mansion called Horrible Hall and engaging in all kinds of nonsense.  There are two musical numbers per show, usually in the form of 60s bubble gum rock with a horror twist on the lyrics.  Actually, some of these songs are pretty good.  The rest of the show is dedicated to endless bad jokes and puns, along with mini scenarios that are as close to any kind of plot you're likely to see.  Being a fan of really stupid puns and jokes, this kind of humor really does it for me.  I mean these puns are bad, so bad that they'll have the Crypt Keeper groaning.  I'm not fortunate enough to have been alive when these cartoons were shown on Saturday mornings, so this review is coming from a guy who doesn't have the childhood memories and nostalgia thing factored in.  That being said, this must actually be a funny cartoon coz usually tv shows don't seem as cool as an adult than they did when you were a child.  This holds up very, very well.  I'd highly recommend it to folks who like the classic monster movies and bad, corny jokes.  Lets face it, outside of Scooby Doo, the whole horror/humor cartoon thing was never done much.  Unfortunately the show only ran 16 episodes, but they're all here, even a few with commentaries.  There's a bonus documentary that's kinda silly.  It's done in a very sitcom scenario type of way that's a bit annoying, but it does feature interviews with some of the folks behind the show, as well as Forrest Ackerman and Alice Cooper.  Well worth a look and a reminder of how cool Saturday morning cartoons once were.",5,This Set Is Driving Me Batty!,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,1882,"['Groovie', 'Goolies', 'never', 'crossed', 'over', 'generations', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'much', 'better', 'cartoon', 'ask', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'Universal', 'monsters', 'spoofs', 'Munsters', 'cartoon', 'right', 'alley', 'maybe', 'yours', 'really', 'plot', 'show', 'bunch', 'assorted', 'monsters', 'hanging', 'out', 'mansion', 'called', 'Horrible', 'Hall', 'engaging', 'kinds', 'nonsense', 'are', 'two', 'musical', 'numbers', 'show', 'usually', 'form', '60s', 'bubble', 'gum', 'rock', 'horror', 'twist', 'lyrics', 'Actually', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'rest', 'show', 'dedicated', 'endless', 'bad', 'jokes', 'puns', 'mini', 'scenarios', 'are', 'close', 'kind', 'plot', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'Being', 'fan', 'really', 'stupid', 'puns', 'jokes', 'kind', 'humor', 'really', 'mean', 'puns', 'are', 'bad', 'so', 'bad', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Crypt', 'Keeper', 'groaning', ""'m"", 'not', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'have', 'been', 'alive', 'when', 'cartoons', 'were', 'shown', 'Saturday', 'mornings', 'review', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'childhood', 'memories', 'nostalgia', 'thing', 'factored', 'being', 'said', 'must', 'actually', 'be', 'funny', 'cartoon', 'coz', 'usually', 'tv', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'cool', 'adult', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'child', 'up', 'very', 'very', 'well', ""'d"", 'highly', 'recommend', 'folks', 'who', 'classic', 'monster', 'movies', 'bad', 'corny', 'jokes', 'face', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'whole', 'horror/humor', 'cartoon', 'thing', 'was', 'never', 'done', 'much', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'only', 'ran', '16', 'episodes', ""'re"", 'here', 'even', 'few', 'commentaries', 'bonus', 'documentary', 'kinda', 'silly', 'done', 'very', 'sitcom', 'scenario', 'type', 'way', 'bit', 'annoying', 'feature', 'interviews', 'folks', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'Forrest', 'Ackerman', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Well', 'look', 'reminder', 'how', 'cool', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'once', 'were']",Groovie Goolies: Saturday Mourning Collection

The colors are brighter than bright, and the images are crystal clear in this set.  The musical tracks have been re-""vamped"" and pumped up, but for some reason, they couldn't do this with some of the novelty voices in the songs, which sound a bit tinny in comparison.  The vocal tracks of the cartoons themselves though, are clean and clear.  Overall, I think they look and sound better than they did when I saw them as a kid. We didn't have cable, so I can see and hear them better than I did when they were broadcast.  The one notable missing thing, as one of the other reviewers stated, is the laugh track.  I don't know why it was taken out, but the programs suffer notably by the lack.  A lot of the jokes were always corny, but somehow it seemed more fun with the show laughing at itself.  Without that, many of the gags seem to fall flat.Overall though, it is a well-done treatment.",4,Good to see the gang again.,1193270400,"10 25, 2007",2007,966,"['feelings', 'Goolies', 'have', 'been', 'lovingly', 'restored', 'colors', 'are', 'brighter', 'bright', 'images', 'are', 'crystal', 'clear', 'set', 'musical', 'tracks', 'have', 'been', 're-', 'vamped', 'pumped', 'up', 'reason', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'novelty', 'voices', 'songs', 'sound', 'bit', 'tinny', 'comparison', 'vocal', 'tracks', 'cartoons', 'are', 'clean', 'clear', 'Overall', 'think', 'look', 'sound', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'saw', 'kid', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'cable', 'can', 'see', 'hear', 'better', 'did', 'when', 'were', 'broadcast', 'one', 'notable', 'missing', 'thing', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'laugh', 'track', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'was', 'taken', 'out', 'programs', 'suffer', 'notably', 'lack', 'lot', 'jokes', 'were', 'always', 'corny', 'somehow', 'seemed', 'more', 'fun', 'show', 'laughing', 'many', 'gags', 'seem', 'fall', 'flat.Overall', 'well-done', 'treatment']",Groovie Goolies: Saturday Mourning Collection
