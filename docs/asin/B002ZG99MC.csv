Last I saw of him was FORBIDDEN KINGDOM, in which he passed his superhero torch to the beautiful Michael Angarano.Here, Chan is Bob Ho, a retired Chinese good-guy-spy ""on loan to the CIA"" for a last mission. What is cool is Chan gives himself a full speaking role and a sweet American love interest. They plan on getting married, Bob (""not my real name"") is retired, all's well.His girl gets a call that her father is in trouble (hip replacement from a softball game injury). She asks Bob to babysit the kids. All hell breaks loose with a hilarious Russian spy who can't find decent clothes, the kids are brats and eventually help Bob with his troubles. Happy ending at the altar.If you think this is warmed-over THREE NINJAS, think again. Chan is not as his best--he's old, give him a rest! The film is heartwarming, funny, not as predictable as you might think. The kids are hilarious and it's clear Chan gave this one a lot of thought. It isn't silly, maudlin or over-the-top. Everything from the spying to the babysitting is spot-on realism.Even Billy Ray Cyrus as the unfairly suspected CIA agent is cool, though he adamantly demonstrates a total lack of acting skill.I won't want this in my Jackie Chan classics collection, but you have to see this film and see what may be the closest portrayal to Chan in real life.

The Spy Next Door invested its capital on a new face of an athletic, short, and youthful Chinese actor, to bring comedy in a global dimension. The unfamiliar face of a Chinese star, his accent, and scant knowledge of the Western culture kept the audience curious on the outcome of his ventures. His days for making living as a spy provided him with a chance to settle down and start a new family. His search for piece and tranquility away from his demanding career will soon be interrupting his effort to build his new nest.The vicious and resourceful spies whom he fought are as powerful as the CIA. They have their inner leads through double spies. The Russian spies, are athletic, mean, and ruthless in their plot to destroy the American oil reserve and advance the Russian market. The Chinese spy accidentally and unkowingly possessed the secret chemical formula that belongs to the terrorists through the sneaking into his computer by the boy whom he was baby-sitting. The missing electronic files ended up in the middle school where the young boy attends. The innocuous playful task of the little boy got the Chinese spy and his baby sitter to be suspected as a double spy. The missing computer files drove the hidden double spy and the Russians terrorists to chase the Chinese spy who for the retrieval of the precious files.The Chinese classified agent could easily be traced to the nuclear scientist from Sandia lab whom Clinton's folks accused for downloading classified secrets. Also, the double spy could also be traced to a recent figure in the same Clinton's administration. The remaining spy technologies are no ground breaking either. The three kids in the Spy Next Door performed much better than the two in the recent movie Old Dogs. They rivaled ""Home Alone"" by behaving like real kids.  The story of the movie is entirely a makeshift scenario of the contemporary news.Where the movie gains strength was most probably the display of how kids would easily and unconditionally fall in love with adult figures as soon as trust is established.

Jackie Chan plays the neighbor who is also a spy. He is dating a woman who thinks he is a pen salesman. Her three kids don't like him. Because of that she can't consider him for a long term relationship. When mom, played by Amber Valletta (a nice cross between Uma and Cameron Diaz) has to leave town, Jackie Chan volunteers to babysit so the kids will get to accept him. Like all similar movies (Uncle Buck, The Pacifier) the kids torment their sitter. Chan, like Candy, uses his skills to overcome them and win their love. The director did a good job on the child actors. The movie is a little hokey at times, but it is still a fun film. It has a happy heart warming ending.",5,"UNCLE BUCK, THE PACIFER, REDEUX",1288396800,"10 30, 2010",2010,767,"['good', 'family', 'film', 'killing', 'blood', 'lot', '3', 'Stooges', 'type', 'violence', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'neighbor', 'who', 'also', 'spy', 'dating', 'woman', 'who', 'pen', 'salesman', 'three', 'kids', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'consider', 'long', 'term', 'relationship', 'When', 'mom', 'played', 'Amber', 'Valletta', 'nice', 'cross', 'Uma', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'leave', 'town', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'volunteers', 'babysit', 'so', 'kids', 'will', 'get', 'accept', 'similar', 'movies', 'Uncle', 'Buck', 'Pacifier', 'kids', 'torment', 'sitter', 'Chan', 'Candy', 'skills', 'overcome', 'win', 'love', 'director', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'child', 'actors', 'movie', 'little', 'hokey', 'times', 'still', 'fun', 'film', 'happy', 'heart', 'warming', 'ending']",The Spy Next Door
