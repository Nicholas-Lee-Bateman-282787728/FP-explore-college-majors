1115465,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000XUOLQQ,B. E Jackson,"[2, 2]","Wow!  Black Irish is a lost masterpiece in the world of drama films.  It's about an Irish family that moves to Boston, and while there, each of the five family members (a father, mother, two brothers and a sister) each have their own problems.  Their problems range from minor to significant, but ALWAYS constant.  This becomes apparent right from the beginning when you see that the two brothers are not exactly on the same page.If there's one really tiny complaint, it's that the sister problems didn't get much attention in comparison to the rest of her family, but then again, her problems (without revealing anything) have been the topic of choice in several other movies.The majority of the storyline focuses on the extremely rocky relationship between the two brothers.  One brother always appears good and honest, while the other one is definitely a punk and a troublermaker, always picking on his younger brother and forcing him to do things he wants absolutely no part of.The younger brother has dreams about being a baseball player.  That's what he wants more than anything else.  However, he has a really hard time convincing his parents that's what he wants, and his mother in particular thinks it's nothing more than a foolish dream.  The father however, turns out to be a big baseball fan.The father has some pretty devastating secrets and might be the most underrated character in the film.  You really feel for him.The drama segments are really interesting because they go through a TON of twists and turns.  It really makes you feel for this family and hope they pull through with their numerous problems.  You really become attached to each family member.  You experience anger, sadness, tension, and several other emotions as the fictional family on your TV screen goes through pretty much anything you can think of.  You never really feel happiness however.  It's a pretty depressing storyline overall.I really like the realism aspect of the Irish family coming to America and losing a small portion of their accent.  That's usually how it happens, so that aspect of the storyline seemed pretty realistic to me.I'm not sure if the ending is more disappointing or satisfying.  You have to see it to know what I mean.  I'm just not sure.  Maybe that's the *only* way to sum up all those horrible events so I'll cut it some slack.Overall, Black Irish is one heck of an underrated film.  It's interesting, emotional, and written brilliantly.  I really think you'll love it.",5,a really good surprise,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2490,"['Wow', 'Black', 'Irish', 'lost', 'masterpiece', 'world', 'drama', 'films', 'Irish', 'family', 'Boston', 'there', 'five', 'family', 'members', 'father', 'mother', 'two', 'brothers', 'sister', 'have', 'own', 'problems', 'problems', 'range', 'minor', 'significant', 'ALWAYS', 'constant', 'apparent', 'right', 'beginning', 'when', 'see', 'two', 'brothers', 'are', 'not', 'exactly', 'same', 'page.If', 'one', 'really', 'tiny', 'complaint', 'sister', 'problems', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'attention', 'comparison', 'rest', 'family', 'then', 'again', 'problems', 'revealing', 'anything', 'have', 'been', 'topic', 'choice', 'several', 'other', 'movies.The', 'majority', 'storyline', 'extremely', 'rocky', 'relationship', 'two', 'brothers', 'One', 'brother', 'always', 'good', 'honest', 'other', 'one', 'definitely', 'punk', 'troublermaker', 'always', 'picking', 'younger', 'brother', 'forcing', 'do', 'things', 'absolutely', 'part', 'younger', 'brother', 'dreams', 'being', 'baseball', 'player', 'what', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'However', 'really', 'hard', 'time', 'convincing', 'parents', 'what', 'mother', 'particular', 'thinks', 'nothing', 'more', 'foolish', 'dream', 'father', 'however', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'baseball', 'fan.The', 'father', 'pretty', 'devastating', 'secrets', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'underrated', 'character', 'film', 'really', 'feel', 'him.The', 'drama', 'segments', 'are', 'really', 'interesting', 'go', 'TON', 'twists', 'turns', 'really', 'feel', 'family', 'hope', 'pull', 'numerous', 'problems', 'really', 'become', 'attached', 'family', 'member', 'experience', 'anger', 'sadness', 'tension', 'several', 'other', 'emotions', 'fictional', 'family', 'TV', 'screen', 'pretty', 'much', 'anything', 'can', 'think', 'never', 'really', 'feel', 'happiness', 'however', 'pretty', 'depressing', 'storyline', 'overall.I', 'really', 'realism', 'aspect', 'Irish', 'family', 'coming', 'America', 'losing', 'small', 'portion', 'accent', 'usually', 'how', 'aspect', 'storyline', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'realistic', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ending', 'more', 'disappointing', 'satisfying', 'have', 'see', 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'Maybe', '*only*', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'horrible', 'events', 'so', ""'ll"", 'cut', 'slack.Overall', 'Black', 'Irish', 'one', 'heck', 'underrated', 'film', 'interesting', 'emotional', 'written', 'brilliantly', 'really', 'think', ""'ll"", 'love']",Black Irish
1115466,AWFBGAY8EP8J5,B000XUOLQQ,"Cornelius G. Kelly ""God Loves Gaze""","[6, 9]","I grew up in the city of Woodside, Queens New York. The whole neighborhood was Irish Catholic and as the mother in this movie protests the daughter's decision to have an abortion and cart her away so the neighbors won't talk. This also was the Black Irish of Woodside. In the end the mother was right and therefore my mom and dad had 11 children. I used to ask her why she had so many kids and she would say, ""who would you like me to give back?"" Then she'd name my siblings from the oldest to the youngest and I'd shiver in fear of the thought of losing any of them.I had a tough older brother who always was getting into trouble and I was the passive one. It took the police to get him back into shape in his early teen years but since about the age of 19 he has been a fine upstanding citizen since with a wife from Woodside. In fact my other brother married her sister so it's all in the neighborhood. Since then we have all moved away from Woodside which looks like a different country now.Yes my dad was as stubborn as the father here. He drank every day but did what ever he could to support us. He had a fine job with Ma Bell phone company for 25 years and used to wash down the altar at St. Theresa's Church and school around the corner to help pay the tuition. He died at 52 from cancer but not before holding his first grandchild who is Afro-American/Irish and the gem of our hearts.I felt like I was watching my life pass by my eyes. My cousins live in Boston and they're the same as us but we didn't get to see each other as much as we wanted growing up since it was hard to bring 11 children over for the weekend.My friend is of Danish ancestory and he enjoyed it as much as I did. I saw his tears swell in many of the scenes. Terry was tough from lack of understanding and love and when he reached out to the Marine recruiter he was cut down again. Cole loved his whole family as much as Terry but Cole had the ability to share it, keep quiet when he knew talking would do no good but persisted in his dreams. My first job was also in a fine Italian eatery. Like another reviewer the bird scene on Cole's first date is hysterical.If ever there was a movie that was pitch perfect to the fact it surely is this one. I must say to another reviewer that streets are empty in a movie so the viewer can see the scenery otherwise if it was packed as I'm sure it usually is one might not know where they are.The police also let us get away with things that were not so much crimminal but not always upright. Of course they also were Irish Catholic too. Everyone knew everyone.Another great movie that's out on DVD is In BurgesIn Brugeswith the father from this movie and Colin Farell. It's not in the states but it's funny as all get out. My father was born in Galway, Ireland with his thick black Irish hair and my mother's mother was from County Claire.Someone give that guy back his $24. I'm sorry he didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of us and I believe it's totally unfair to give it one star. But he certainly has the right to say what he thinks of it as we all have our own opinions.",5,Black Irish Are Everywhere,1225152000,"10 28, 2008",2008,3099,"['grew', 'up', 'city', 'Woodside', 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'whole', 'neighborhood', 'was', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'mother', 'movie', 'daughter', 'decision', 'have', 'abortion', 'cart', 'away', 'neighbors', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'also', 'was', 'Black', 'Irish', 'Woodside', 'end', 'mother', 'was', 'right', 'therefore', 'mom', 'dad', 'had', '11', 'children', 'used', 'ask', 'why', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'kids', 'would', 'say', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'give', 'back', 'Then', ""'d"", 'name', 'siblings', 'oldest', 'youngest', ""'d"", 'shiver', 'fear', 'thought', 'losing', 'them.I', 'had', 'tough', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'always', 'was', 'getting', 'trouble', 'was', 'passive', 'one', 'took', 'police', 'get', 'back', 'shape', 'early', 'teen', 'years', 'age', '19', 'been', 'fine', 'upstanding', 'citizen', 'wife', 'Woodside', 'fact', 'other', 'brother', 'married', 'sister', 'neighborhood', 'then', 'have', 'moved', 'away', 'Woodside', 'different', 'country', 'dad', 'was', 'as', 'stubborn', 'father', 'here', 'drank', 'day', 'did', 'what', 'ever', 'could', 'support', 'had', 'fine', 'job', 'Ma', 'Bell', 'phone', 'company', '25', 'years', 'used', 'wash', 'down', 'altar', 'St.', 'Theresa', 'Church', 'school', 'corner', 'help', 'pay', 'tuition', 'died', '52', 'cancer', 'not', 'holding', 'first', 'grandchild', 'who', 'Afro-American/Irish', 'gem', 'hearts.I', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'life', 'pass', 'eyes', 'cousins', 'live', 'Boston', ""'re"", 'same', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'other', 'as', 'much', 'wanted', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'hard', 'bring', '11', 'children', 'weekend.My', 'friend', 'Danish', 'ancestory', 'enjoyed', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'saw', 'tears', 'swell', 'many', 'scenes', 'Terry', 'was', 'tough', 'lack', 'understanding', 'love', 'when', 'reached', 'out', 'Marine', 'recruiter', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'again', 'Cole', 'loved', 'whole', 'family', 'as', 'much', 'Terry', 'Cole', 'had', 'ability', 'share', 'keep', 'quiet', 'when', 'knew', 'talking', 'would', 'do', 'good', 'persisted', 'dreams', 'first', 'job', 'was', 'also', 'fine', 'Italian', 'eatery', 'reviewer', 'bird', 'scene', 'Cole', 'first', 'date', 'hysterical.If', 'ever', 'was', 'movie', 'was', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'fact', 'surely', 'one', 'must', 'say', 'reviewer', 'streets', 'are', 'empty', 'movie', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'scenery', 'otherwise', 'was', 'packed', ""'m"", 'sure', 'usually', 'one', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'are.The', 'police', 'also', 'let', 'get', 'away', 'things', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'crimminal', 'not', 'always', 'upright', 'course', 'also', 'were', 'Irish', 'Catholic', 'too', 'Everyone', 'knew', 'everyone.Another', 'great', 'movie', 'out', 'DVD', 'BurgesIn', 'Brugeswith', 'father', 'movie', 'Colin', 'Farell', 'not', 'states', 'funny', 'get', 'out', 'father', 'was', 'born', 'Galway', 'Ireland', 'thick', 'black', 'Irish', 'hair', 'mother', 'mother', 'was', 'County', 'Claire.Someone', 'give', 'guy', 'back', '24', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'rest', 'believe', 'totally', 'unfair', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'certainly', 'right', 'say', 'what', 'have', 'own', 'opinions']",Black Irish

It is the story of a family trying to cope and stuggle with many different issues all at the same time. Set in South Boston, it presents a very realistic and intense view of family life. Michael Angarano is simply fantastic as the younger of three siblings trying to cope with an Irish Catholic family that is both dysfunctional and bursting with intense love. Older brother Terry, portrayed with honesty and intelligence by Tom Guiry, cannot seem to find his niche in the world while daughter Kate struggles with a pregnancy that is shameful at first to her family. As these characters collide we discover a lost talent the father, Brendan GleesonIn Bruges, simply threw away has resurfaced in his younger child Angarano (he is a prodigy pitcher at baseball.) This Echo Bridge release should not be missed and the emoting of these actors are rare and first rate. The stunning conclusion, which I will not give away here, will make your heart swell.

1115468,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000XUOLQQ,Grady Harp,"[27, 27]","BLACK IRISH is one of those little Independent films that manage to give more to the audience than the extreme constrictions of time and budget would suggest.  Writer/director Brad Gunn (his first film) manages to tell a story about an Irish family from South Boston that is sincere, realistic, poignant, and profound, and though he worked with a small budget and a shooting schedule of 22 days, he has produced a fine little gem of a film.The McKay family has problems: father Desmond (Brendan Glesson) lacks work and spends most of his time drinking beer and watching baseball on TV, having been a promising baseball player as a youngster but nipped by the Vietnam War into glum lethargy; mother Margaret (Melissa Leo) resents the shadow of the man she married and works as a social worker to support her family; daughter Kathleen (Emily VanKamp) is pregnant, unwed, and when denied the choice of abortion by her mother's strong Catholicism is determined to have the child by herself, giving it the loving home she feels she has been denied; son Terry (Tom Guiry) is a tortured delinquent who is a gang member and always in conflict with the law; and youngest son Cole (the excellent young 20-year-old Michael Angarano of 'One Last Thing', 'Man in the Chair', 'Snow Angels', 'Lords of Dogtown', 'Seabiscuit',  etc) is conflicted by wanting to be a priest versus wanting to be a professional baseball player - he is the good kid and the last hope of his parents.Terry tricks Cole into accompanying a house break-in and the trouble begins. The financial crisis at home drives Cole to get a job in a restaurant, and drives Desmond to menial work shining shoes.  The family will support Kathleen's pregnancy, but that strips the income to the point that Cole must leave his Catholic school to be in public school, and while that seems to dash his hopes for a career in baseball, the coach at his public school (Finn Curtin) acknowledges Cole's talent and promises a future.  Terry's lifestyle as a hoodlum presents increasing problems and at one point Cole gathers the courage to confront Terry during a robbery plot at Cole's work place and Terry is seriously wounded. We discover a hidden fact about Desmond that explains some of his sociopath behavior to his family and it is this discovery, coinciding with Terry's gunshot injury and Kathleen's tough life as an unwed working pregnant girl, that pulls the family unit back together.If the plot sound like soap opera rest assured it is not.  This is an intensely realistic examination of a fragile Irish Catholic family striving to makes sense of a world that is increasingly chaotic.  All of the actors are excellent, but the extraordinary sensitivity and skill of young Michael Angarano make this a film to cherish. And Brad Gann is assuredly a talent to watch!

The McKay family could have benefited from the belief that God can be exalted on a baseball diamond or in any proper job. The movie shows how pain can sometimes bring people together, and it does all of this with a blend of pathos and humor. For example, I loved the scene when Mrs. McKay asks Terry to forgive her, but I also loved Cole's first date scene. Warning: first dates can be harmful to birds and to audience members who laugh too hard. Rated R for some thematic elements, language and brief violence.",4,The Sacred and the Secular,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",2012,884,"['Irish', 'captivating', 'moving', 'faithfully', 'rendered', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'set', 'south', 'Boston', 'veil', 'see', 'how', 'resentment', 'self-righteousness', 'alcoholism', 'lack', 'self-control', 'rebelliousness', 'tear', 'families', 'communities', 'apart', 'also', 'how', 'destructive', 'tendency', 'divide', 'life', 'up', 'sacred', 'secular', 'compartments', 'can', 'be', 'McKay', 'family', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'belief', 'God', 'can', 'be', 'exalted', 'baseball', 'diamond', 'proper', 'job', 'movie', 'how', 'pain', 'can', 'sometimes', 'bring', 'people', 'together', 'blend', 'pathos', 'humor', 'example', 'loved', 'scene', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'McKay', 'Terry', 'forgive', 'also', 'loved', 'Cole', 'first', 'date', 'scene', 'Warning', 'first', 'dates', 'can', 'be', 'harmful', 'birds', 'audience', 'members', 'who', 'laugh', 'too', 'hard', 'Rated', 'R', 'thematic', 'elements', 'language', 'brief', 'violence']",Black Irish
1115475,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B000XUOLQQ,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","This is not an original story, it seems that in recent years we have been flooded with stories that are very similar to this. It was very well done though, with an all-star cast, and a few twists in the story. Black Irish is another story about an Irish family living in Boston. Dad's an alcoholic, Mom is as strict as they come, the older brother is into crime, the older sister is facing a life changing decision, and Cole McKay (Michael Angarano) is stuck in the middle. The story chronicles a year in the life of the McKay family and features many changes that oddly happen all at once. The story wasn't anything special, but it was done in a way that wasn't as predictable as some of the other Boston family films, none of the characters are cops, and there is even some humor thrown in here and there. Being a lifelong baseball fan, that angle of Cole's life was the one I really related to and it helped the film to stand out even a little more. Oscar winner, Melissa Leo, does an amazing job and really puts the emotions into context. Everyone in the McKay family is a tough guy, they don't feel anything, and while she appears to be the strictest one of all, she's the one who really expresses the emotions that everyone must have felt. Angarano wasn't bad either, but I've seen him in things before and as usual, he lacks any kind of expression, he just always seems to go with the flow and do an adequate job, but nothing else. The big surprise of this film was seeing Tom Guiry, A.K.A. Smalls from the Sandlot as a tough, Boston-area, criminal. Seeing the sweet, innocent, kid I grew up know as Scotty Smalls, turn into a fowl mouthed, tough ass, drug dealer was pretty funny. Overall, Black Irish isn't a bad film, it's entertaining and it's unpredictable. There are a lot of different angles and the film moves quickly through the story, but the performances were a mixed bag, and a lot of aspects seemed to mirror similar films. If you don't watch a lot of movies, you'll love this film, but if you're a fanatic and you watch this, you'll probably be able to easily list a dozen films that are very similar.",4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",2013,2122,"['not', 'original', 'story', 'recent', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'flooded', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'though', 'all-star', 'cast', 'few', 'twists', 'story', 'Black', 'Irish', 'story', 'Irish', 'family', 'living', 'Boston', 'Dad', 'alcoholic', 'Mom', 'as', 'strict', 'come', 'older', 'brother', 'crime', 'older', 'sister', 'facing', 'life', 'changing', 'decision', 'Cole', 'McKay', 'Michael', 'Angarano', 'stuck', 'middle', 'story', 'year', 'life', 'McKay', 'family', 'many', 'changes', 'oddly', 'happen', 'once', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'special', 'was', 'done', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'predictable', 'other', 'Boston', 'family', 'films', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'cops', 'even', 'humor', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'Being', 'lifelong', 'baseball', 'fan', 'angle', 'Cole', 'life', 'was', 'one', 'really', 'related', 'helped', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Melissa', 'Leo', 'amazing', 'job', 'really', 'emotions', 'context', 'Everyone', 'McKay', 'family', 'tough', 'guy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'be', 'strictest', 'one', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'emotions', 'everyone', 'must', 'have', 'felt', 'Angarano', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'either', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'things', 'before', 'as', 'usual', 'kind', 'expression', 'just', 'always', 'go', 'flow', 'do', 'adequate', 'job', 'nothing', 'else', 'big', 'surprise', 'film', 'was', 'seeing', 'Tom', 'Guiry', 'A.K.A', 'Smalls', 'Sandlot', 'tough', 'Boston-area', 'criminal', 'Seeing', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'kid', 'grew', 'up', 'know', 'Scotty', 'Smalls', 'turn', 'fowl', 'mouthed', 'tough', 'ass', 'drug', 'dealer', 'was', 'pretty', 'funny', 'Overall', 'Black', 'Irish', ""n't"", 'bad', 'film', 'entertaining', 'unpredictable', 'are', 'lot', 'different', 'angles', 'film', 'moves', 'quickly', 'story', 'performances', 'were', 'mixed', 'bag', 'lot', 'aspects', 'seemed', 'mirror', 'similar', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', ""'re"", 'fanatic', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'able', 'easily', 'list', 'dozen', 'films', 'are', 'very', 'similar']",Black Irish
