1428504,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004USUOUO,Mark Turner,"[9, 9]","In 1977 a group of musicians came together to form the band Foreigner. Several had been in some major bands in the past including Spooky Tooth and King Crimson, making them one of the first of many ""super bands"" as groups with members in other bands were called. Their initial outing contained several hits and made them a staple on rock radio for years. They've changed line ups over the years but Mick Jones has remained a constant and he still rocks out over 30 years later.FOREIGNER LIVE features the most current line up for the band in 2008 when this was made. Released before, the DVD is now available in blu-ray format, increasing not just the great picture quality but the sound as well.  When it comes to watching AND listening to this great band perform in 5.1 DTS you'll know that investing in the surround system is well worth doing.The line up of the band featured here includes Jones, Tom Gimbel who toured with Aerosmith, Jeff Pilson who was one of the original members of Dokken, Michael Bluestein who played with Boz Skaggs and Stevie Nicks, Jason Bonham son of Led Zepplin drummer John Bonham and new lead singer Kelly Hansen. All of them are insanely talented individuals but it is Hansen who pulls off the most amazing thing for any member in the group. That's because Hansen, as lead singer, sounds nearly exactly like original singer Lou Gramm. Face it, the vocals are what make most bands recognizable. To find someone who not only can perform as if he's been there all along but to make the songs sound like they did originally is amazing.The DVD was part of the SoundStage series that filmed in Chicago and used a standard backdrop with screens displaying the name of the featured guest. Add to that the lights the band uses and the fact that they don't rely on the props but more on their musical ability and you have a dynamite DVD. What amazed me most was that while I thought I was a so so fan of the group, I found that there were more songs I liked by them than I realized. It made me want to dig out the greatest hits CD to listen to while driving!The set list for the DVD is as follows, featuring all the great hits of the band and one new original song:1. Night Life2. Head Games3. Gold As Ice4. Waiting for a Girl Like You5. Too Late6. Say You Will7. Long, Long Way From Home8. Double Vision9. Blue Morning, Blue Day10. Dirty White Boy11. Starrider12. Feels Like the First Time13. Urgent14. Juke Box Hero15. I Want to Know What Love Is16. Hot BloodedTwo songs have always been special to me among the hits by Foreigner. The first was ""Juke Box Hero"", a song that captured the dream of every young man who ever had the desire to be a rock star, and face it we all did at one time or another. The story of a young man who can't see the show but listens outside and does everything he can to make it to the top is storytelling at its best from someone inside the world being sung about.The second was ""I Want to Know What Love Is"". Why? Because the day my son was born that was the number one single in the U.S. I even purchased a 45 of the song (remember those?) and enclosed it in the baby book we made for him. It remains there to this day, never played.Fans of rock music will find this to be a completely entertaining DVD to add to their collection. Those who thought they weren't Foreigner fans will discover that they actually liked more songs than they remembered. And for those who haven't heard them at all, sit back and enjoy one of the great rock bands of all time.",5,CLASSIC BAND ROCKS OUT,1313366400,"08 15, 2011",2011,3510,"['1977', 'group', 'musicians', 'came', 'together', 'form', 'band', 'Foreigner', 'Several', 'had', 'been', 'major', 'bands', 'past', 'including', 'Spooky', 'Tooth', 'King', 'Crimson', 'making', 'one', 'first', 'many', 'super', 'bands', 'groups', 'members', 'other', 'bands', 'were', 'called', 'initial', 'outing', 'contained', 'several', 'hits', 'made', 'staple', 'rock', 'radio', 'years', ""'ve"", 'changed', 'line', 'ups', 'years', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'remained', 'constant', 'still', 'out', '30', 'years', 'later.FOREIGNER', 'LIVE', 'most', 'current', 'line', 'band', '2008', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'Released', 'DVD', 'now', 'available', 'blu-ray', 'format', 'increasing', 'not', 'just', 'great', 'picture', 'quality', 'sound', 'as', 'well', 'When', 'watching', 'AND', 'listening', 'great', 'band', 'perform', '5.1', 'DTS', ""'ll"", 'know', 'investing', 'surround', 'system', 'well', 'worth', 'doing.The', 'line', 'band', 'featured', 'here', 'Jones', 'Tom', 'Gimbel', 'who', 'toured', 'Aerosmith', 'Jeff', 'Pilson', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'original', 'members', 'Dokken', 'Michael', 'Bluestein', 'who', 'played', 'Boz', 'Skaggs', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'son', 'Led', 'Zepplin', 'drummer', 'John', 'Bonham', 'new', 'lead', 'singer', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'are', 'insanely', 'talented', 'individuals', 'Hansen', 'who', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'member', 'group', 'Hansen', 'lead', 'singer', 'nearly', 'exactly', 'original', 'singer', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'Face', 'vocals', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'most', 'bands', 'recognizable', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'can', 'perform', 'been', 'there', 'all', 'along', 'make', 'songs', 'sound', 'did', 'originally', 'amazing.The', 'DVD', 'was', 'part', 'SoundStage', 'series', 'filmed', 'Chicago', 'used', 'standard', 'backdrop', 'screens', 'displaying', 'name', 'featured', 'guest', 'Add', 'lights', 'band', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'props', 'more', 'musical', 'ability', 'have', 'dynamite', 'DVD', 'What', 'amazed', 'most', 'was', 'thought', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'fan', 'group', 'found', 'were', 'more', 'songs', 'liked', 'realized', 'made', 'want', 'dig', 'out', 'greatest', 'hits', 'CD', 'listen', 'driving', 'set', 'list', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'great', 'hits', 'band', 'one', 'new', 'original', 'song:1', 'Night', 'Life2', 'Head', 'Games3', 'Gold', 'Ice4', 'Waiting', 'Girl', 'You5', 'Too', 'Late6', 'Say', 'Will7', 'Long', 'Long', 'Way', 'Home8', 'Double', 'Vision9', 'Blue', 'Morning', 'Blue', 'Day10', 'Dirty', 'White', 'Boy11', 'Starrider12', 'Feels', 'First', 'Time13', 'Urgent14', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero15', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Is16', 'Hot', 'BloodedTwo', 'songs', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'special', 'hits', 'Foreigner', 'first', 'was', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero', 'song', 'captured', 'dream', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ever', 'had', 'desire', 'be', 'rock', 'star', 'face', 'did', 'one', 'time', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'show', 'outside', 'everything', 'can', 'make', 'top', 'storytelling', 'best', 'someone', 'world', 'being', 'sung', 'about.The', 'second', 'was', 'Want', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Why', 'day', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'was', 'number', 'one', 'single', 'U.S', 'even', 'purchased', '45', 'song', 'remember', 'enclosed', 'baby', 'book', 'made', 'there', 'day', 'never', 'played.Fans', 'rock', 'music', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'completely', 'entertaining', 'DVD', 'add', 'collection', 'who', 'thought', 'were', ""n't"", 'Foreigner', 'fans', 'will', 'discover', 'actually', 'liked', 'more', 'songs', 'remembered', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'one', 'great', 'rock', 'bands', 'time']",Foreigner: Live

1428513,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B004USUOUO,trebe,"[0, 0]","This tight and powerful performance by Foreigner is from an appearance on the Soundstage program probably recorded in 2007.  Led by guitarist Mick Jones, and featuring Kelly Hansen on vocals, the 16 song concert runs about 104 minutes, with a setlist that contains most of their most popular and well-known hits.  It's a dynamic performance, with plenty of variety.  The DVD is well produced and edited.  As the lighting levels onstage are generally high, the image quality of the Bluray is simply fabulous.  The stage is quite large and relatively free of visual obstructions, providing some excellent views of the band, who are literally just a few feet away from the audience.Founded by Jones and vocalist Lou Gramm, Foreigner burst on the scene in 1977, and soon became one of the hottest rock bands of the late 70's, with a string of radio friendly hits that ran from rockers to power ballads.  Foreigner was a versatile group that drew fans from various demographics.  While able to rock hard, the band gradually moved in a softer a more melodic direction during the 1980's, displaying solid songwriting, and an affinity for incorporating catchy melodies and keyboards.Gramm left the band in the late 80's to pursue a solo career, while Mick Jones pushed on with Foreigner.  Though Gramm returned to Foreigner for a time, he eventually departed again.  Fortunately, Kelly Hansen's voice is remarkably similar to Gramm's.  It's amazing how great Foreigner sounds with Hansen singing.  The vocalist seems quite youthful for 46, and brings great energy to the band.  Completing Foreigner's lineup are Jason Bonham (UFO, Bonham) on drums, Jeff Pilson (Dokken, Dio) on bass, Michael Bluestein on keyboards, and multitalented Tom Gimbel on guitar, saxophone, and flute.Foreigner gets things started with Night Life, with Hansen prancing around the stage, looking a bit like Steven Tyler, almost immediately establishing rapport with the audience.  The band then takes a firm grip on the crowd, powering through the hits Head Games, Cold As Ice, and the melodic magic of Waiting For A Girl Like You.Too Late, is the only new song in the set, and it's a pretty darn catchy tune.  It would later be included on their album Can't Slow Down, released in 2009.  The band then turns it down, for an acoustic version of Say You Will, that really showcases Hansen's voice, with ample backing vocals from the rest of the band.  It's definitely a warm, feel good time.The band cranks it up, blasting through classic material from their first four albums, including Long Long Way From Home, Double Vision, Feels Like The First Time, and the raucous Elvis Presley tribute, Dirty While Boy.  Definite high points are Mick Jones singing lead on the spacey Starrider, and Tommy Gimbel's inspired sax playing on an ultra sexy version of Urgent.  Juke Box Hero is a funky improvisational vehicle for the band, where they pay homage to Led Zeppelin.  Foreigner finishes the performance with a killer version of Hot Blooded, showing that there is still a lot of life in this band, and that their music proudly stands the test of time.While replacing a singer with the talent of Lou Gramm was a huge challenge, in Kelly Hansen, Foreigner has clearly hit the jackpot, as the singer breathes new life into all the classic tunes, while putting his own personal stamp on the songs.  The band's lineup has continued to change since this performance, but as long as Mick Jones is around, the heart of Foreigner will continue to beat strongly.If you are a fan of Foreigner from the Hansen era, this Bluray disc is highly recommended.  Sound options are DTS-MA 5.1 Surround Sound, and LPCM Stereo.  Unfortunately there are no extra features.  This same Soundstage performance has apparently been previously been released on DVD, but the Bluray's superior image quality may make the upgrade worthy of consideration.",5,a really fine 2007 performance from Foreigner with Kelly Hansen...,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,3885,"['tight', 'powerful', 'performance', 'Foreigner', 'appearance', 'Soundstage', 'program', 'probably', 'recorded', '2007', 'Led', 'guitarist', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'featuring', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'vocals', '16', 'song', 'concert', '104', 'minutes', 'setlist', 'most', 'most', 'popular', 'well-known', 'hits', 'dynamic', 'performance', 'plenty', 'variety', 'DVD', 'well', 'produced', 'edited', 'lighting', 'levels', 'onstage', 'are', 'generally', 'high', 'image', 'quality', 'Bluray', 'simply', 'fabulous', 'stage', 'quite', 'large', 'relatively', 'free', 'visual', 'obstructions', 'providing', 'excellent', 'views', 'band', 'who', 'are', 'literally', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'away', 'audience.Founded', 'Jones', 'vocalist', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'Foreigner', 'burst', 'scene', '1977', 'soon', 'became', 'one', 'hottest', 'rock', 'bands', 'late', '70', 'string', 'radio', 'friendly', 'ran', 'rockers', 'power', 'ballads', 'Foreigner', 'was', 'versatile', 'group', 'drew', 'fans', 'various', 'demographics', 'able', 'rock', 'hard', 'band', 'gradually', 'moved', 'softer', 'more', 'melodic', 'direction', '1980', 'displaying', 'solid', 'songwriting', 'affinity', 'incorporating', 'catchy', 'melodies', 'keyboards.Gramm', 'left', 'band', 'late', '80', 'pursue', 'solo', 'career', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'pushed', 'Foreigner', 'Though', 'Gramm', 'returned', 'Foreigner', 'time', 'eventually', 'departed', 'again', 'Fortunately', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'voice', 'remarkably', 'similar', 'Gramm', 'amazing', 'how', 'great', 'Foreigner', 'Hansen', 'singing', 'vocalist', 'quite', 'youthful', '46', 'great', 'energy', 'band', 'Completing', 'Foreigner', 'lineup', 'are', 'Jason', 'Bonham', 'UFO', 'Bonham', 'drums', 'Jeff', 'Pilson', 'Dokken', 'Dio', 'bass', 'Michael', 'Bluestein', 'keyboards', 'multitalented', 'Tom', 'Gimbel', 'guitar', 'saxophone', 'flute.Foreigner', 'things', 'started', 'Night', 'Life', 'Hansen', 'prancing', 'stage', 'looking', 'bit', 'Steven', 'Tyler', 'almost', 'immediately', 'establishing', 'rapport', 'audience', 'band', 'then', 'firm', 'grip', 'crowd', 'powering', 'hits', 'Head', 'Games', 'Cold', 'Ice', 'melodic', 'magic', 'Waiting', 'A', 'Girl', 'You.Too', 'Late', 'only', 'new', 'song', 'set', 'pretty', 'darn', 'catchy', 'tune', 'would', 'later', 'be', 'included', 'album', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Slow', 'Down', 'released', '2009', 'band', 'then', 'down', 'acoustic', 'version', 'Say', 'Will', 'really', 'Hansen', 'voice', 'ample', 'backing', 'vocals', 'rest', 'band', 'definitely', 'warm', 'feel', 'good', 'time.The', 'band', 'cranks', 'up', 'blasting', 'classic', 'material', 'first', 'four', 'albums', 'including', 'Long', 'Long', 'Way', 'From', 'Home', 'Double', 'Vision', 'Feels', 'First', 'Time', 'raucous', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'tribute', 'Dirty', 'Boy', 'Definite', 'high', 'points', 'are', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'singing', 'lead', 'spacey', 'Starrider', 'Tommy', 'Gimbel', 'inspired', 'sax', 'playing', 'ultra', 'sexy', 'version', 'Urgent', 'Juke', 'Box', 'Hero', 'funky', 'improvisational', 'vehicle', 'band', 'where', 'pay', 'homage', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Foreigner', 'performance', 'killer', 'version', 'Hot', 'Blooded', 'showing', 'still', 'lot', 'life', 'band', 'music', 'proudly', 'test', 'time.While', 'replacing', 'singer', 'talent', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'was', 'huge', 'challenge', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'Foreigner', 'clearly', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'singer', 'new', 'life', 'classic', 'tunes', 'putting', 'own', 'personal', 'stamp', 'songs', 'band', 'lineup', 'continued', 'change', 'performance', 'as', 'long', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'around', 'heart', 'Foreigner', 'will', 'continue', 'beat', 'strongly.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Foreigner', 'Hansen', 'era', 'Bluray', 'disc', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Sound', 'options', 'are', 'DTS-MA', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'LPCM', 'Stereo', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'extra', 'features', 'same', 'Soundstage', 'performance', 'apparently', 'been', 'previously', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'superior', 'image', 'quality', 'may', 'make', 'upgrade', 'worthy', 'consideration']",Foreigner: Live

I pulled the DVD and moved to the better sound system. Mick Jones and Kelly Hansen were CRUSHING it. They did so the rest of ther DVD.It was ALL good. Mick was solid all the way through. Kelly was fantastic. His energy was awesome. His voice was perfect. Sounded just like the original. His crowd interaction was phenomenal. Jason Bonham was a SCORE; no idea how they got him.Playlist was perfect. This is going to be one of those DVDs that I watch till it wears out and I like the music MORE because of this DVD.Yea..

Hansen gives it the ol' college try, but IMO he will never be that good of a replacement for Gramm.  As far as the replacements for classic rock bands go, Hansen doesn't quite rank with Pineda in Journey or even Tommy DeCarlo in Boston.",3,The Kelly Hansen version,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,583,"['Notes', 'performances', 'moment', 'BE', 'WARNED', 'current', 'Foreigner', 'lineup', 'Kelly', 'Hansen', 'vocals', 'rather', 'classic', 'Lou', 'Gramm', 'lineup.Of', 'course', 'still', 'get', 'see', 'electrifying', 'guitar', 'work', 'Mick', 'Jones', 'including', 'fine', 'solos', 'many', 'hits', 'are', 'here', 'ex.', 'Double', 'Vision', 'Wan', 'na', 'Know', 'What', 'Love', 'Hansen', 'ol', 'college', 'try', 'IMO', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'good', 'replacement', 'Gramm', 'As', 'far', 'replacements', 'classic', 'rock', 'bands', 'go', 'Hansen', ""n't"", 'quite', 'rank', 'Pineda', 'Journey', 'even', 'Tommy', 'DeCarlo', 'Boston']",Foreigner: Live
