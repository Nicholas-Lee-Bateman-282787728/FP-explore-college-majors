When he discovers the balloon is too large to take on the bus he decides to walk to his destination. His new acquisition is soon noticed by a group of bullies who desire the balloon for themselves and a chase ensues. Will the boy get away with his balloon intact? What eventually happens is both bittersweet and unexpected. It's truly the stuff from which delightful day dreams are made.Critique: For me, the charming little '56 French film `The Red Balloon' carries with it fond memories of grammar school. Whenever it was too rainy outside for recess the student body would be gathered into the cafeteria to watch a short film or a couple of cartoons. Without question the film most requested by the young audience was `The Red Balloon.'It had been at least forty years since my last viewing of this childhood classic. I'm happy to say that it still possesses all the charm and childhood wonder as it had upon its initial release fifty years ago. Looking at the streets of Paris as they were in the mid-fifties is a delight all its own serving as a mini-time capsule of a more innocent, nave time in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.`The Red Balloon' is waiting to enchant a whole new generation of viewers!

It would've been, oh, about 1978 or 1979. Around the time I was in the 2nd grade. I don't remember a lot from that time of my life (it was, after all, a very long time ago). But I remember this movie! Heck, I even remember owning, of all things, a book that had stills from the movie with captions explaining what was going on. So, yeah, it was an important film for me when I was growing up.""The Red Balloon"", for those who don't know, is the simple story of a very young boy who finds a balloon tied to a lamppost. He unties it and it wanders around with him, apparently at least as smart as a dog. Things go well for our young hero until a group of bullies decide the want the balloon for themselves.It's amazing to look at this film now and realize how much it colored my impressions of France in general, and Paris in particular. To this day, when I think of Paris, I still tend to think of it in the vaguely grey, post-war scences shown in this movie. Rationally, I know Paris today is nothing like what we see here, but I think until I finally visit the place, this movie will loom large as my primary image of what the city is.As an adult, I appreciate a lot I didn't see about the movie when I was a kid. The color scheme is mostly various shades of grey, except for the balloon; a bright red splash of color in a drab landscape. Later in the movie we see dozens of other balloons in a rainbow of color, flying out over the grey city. It's a very striking image, and the picture looks spectacular. Obviously a lot of time and effort was spent restoring the film stock. It looks like it could've rolled out to theatres yesterday.I was also surprised at how touched by the story I was, even now. Amazed to find myself actually in tears at the end of it, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've cried at a movie (for the curious, the only two others I can think of off the top of my head areA.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)andTitanic (Three-Disc Special Collector's Edition), though in the case of ""AI"", the tears stopped rolling during the ""WTF?"" bit with the future robots. That movie should've ended with the boybot under the water, endless pleading with the Blue Fairy). I don't know what it was about this movie that set me off, but it did.Some words here about the extras on this DVD. Those words are, ""What extras?"" You get a trailer for this andWhite Mane (Released by Janus Films, in association with the Criterion Collection), and that's it. Now, given that it's a very short film, I wasn't expecting much. But would it have been too terribly difficult for them to throw in, say, interviews with people involved, visits to the sites today, and maybe a retrospective from some modern filmmakers who might cite this movie as inspiration? Frankly, I expected better from a DVD that has the word ""Criterion"" on it. Yes, I know it was released by Janus films, but if Critierion is going to have their name on it, it should at least come close to being up to their usual standards.That said, this movie is a great value for the price.

Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[4, 4]","This film was made in 1956 by a father and son team in Paris, receiving several awards then, and still holds us amazed.I have seen this film countless times, thirty years ago on a clackety old 16mm print in an urban day care, endlessly over and over, and now with preschoolers who still never tire of seeing it again. And again.Nor do I.Even now, I cannot for the life of me figure out all of the tricks used to manipulate the balloon so convincingly, with so much character and personality, with greater humor and real emotion and visible thought than most actors nowadays (who shall here remain nameless).I can only see the controlling fishline at the death of the balloon (okay, no spoiler here!), but otherwise, and earlier, carefully following its trajectory, there is no way in the pre-digital age this balloon can do all of those things, passing through windows and following complex paths, and at great heights entering high rise windows.OK?Believe me. I have watched it carefully perhaps more than anyone alive, with the possible exception of Pascal LaMorisse himself, who must now be over sixty years old, and is a far finer actor here than any since as well.And I never tire of it.Nor do my students.Skip anything made in the past half century, anything by Disney or Pixar or the rest, even Avatar.Get this one instead and prepare to see it several times with your children.Along with several other subtexts we certainly find here the Life of Christ, complete with the mission, the preaching of love, the ejection from the temple, the passion, death and resurrection.Watch and then tell me I'm wrong. The scene of the small boy sitting desolate upon the ground with the dead balloon in his arms is pure Pieta, and then the Resurrection and the Ascension into Heaven . . .again, no spoilers here.But I am ready to be convinced the director sent up a dummy and did not really sacrifice his own son soaring over the rooftops of Paris, like that guy claimed he did recently in Fort Collins Colorado with a home-made weather balloon while his similarly six year old son really hid in the attic.That was all a publicity stunt.This is eternal art.And children love it. The bad boys at the end; the little girl with the blue balloon, the struggle with authority, everything is amazing, and as a child sees it.You will believe they studied Piaget.You will believe a boy can fly.Above all you will love forever this 36 minute film, and play it again until even your children cry, Enough!My students have never come to that point, but it is possible.I guess.I find the reproduction here excellent, and clearer than any copy I have ever seen, and the soundtrack clean as well. It looks as crisp as any DVD I have; this is not burned off a bad 16mm copy as alleged elsewhere. This must be from a master tape.But still as hard as I try I cannot see the controlling strings, except at the final descent (NO SPOILER HERE!).Kids love this film.I do too.And so will you.Also see pleaseThe White Dove (aka Holubice) (1960)with a generally similar hidden subtext, although rather too strong for children.",5,"Although the star must now be over sixty, this film still holds young children (and old adults) amazed, repeatedly",1266537600,"02 19, 2010",2010,3095,"['film', 'was', 'made', '1956', 'father', 'son', 'team', 'Paris', 'receiving', 'several', 'awards', 'then', 'still', 'amazed.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'countless', 'times', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'clackety', 'old', '16mm', 'print', 'urban', 'day', 'care', 'endlessly', 'now', 'preschoolers', 'who', 'still', 'never', 'tire', 'seeing', 'again', 'again.Nor', 'do', 'I.Even', 'now', 'can', 'not', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'tricks', 'used', 'manipulate', 'balloon', 'so', 'convincingly', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'personality', 'greater', 'humor', 'real', 'emotion', 'visible', 'thought', 'most', 'actors', 'nowadays', 'who', 'shall', 'here', 'remain', 'nameless', '.I', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'controlling', 'fishline', 'death', 'balloon', 'okay', 'spoiler', 'here', 'otherwise', 'earlier', 'carefully', 'following', 'trajectory', 'way', 'pre-digital', 'age', 'balloon', 'can', 'do', 'things', 'passing', 'windows', 'following', 'complex', 'paths', 'great', 'heights', 'entering', 'high', 'rise', 'windows.OK', 'Believe', 'have', 'watched', 'carefully', 'perhaps', 'more', 'anyone', 'alive', 'possible', 'exception', 'Pascal', 'LaMorisse', 'who', 'must', 'now', 'be', 'sixty', 'years', 'old', 'far', 'finer', 'actor', 'here', 'well.And', 'never', 'tire', 'it.Nor', 'do', 'students.Skip', 'anything', 'made', 'past', 'half', 'century', 'anything', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'rest', 'even', 'Avatar.Get', 'one', 'instead', 'prepare', 'see', 'several', 'times', 'children.Along', 'several', 'other', 'subtexts', 'certainly', 'find', 'here', 'Life', 'Christ', 'complete', 'mission', 'preaching', 'love', 'ejection', 'temple', 'passion', 'death', 'resurrection.Watch', 'then', 'tell', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'scene', 'small', 'boy', 'sitting', 'desolate', 'ground', 'dead', 'balloon', 'arms', 'pure', 'Pieta', 'then', 'Resurrection', 'Ascension', 'Heaven', '.again', 'spoilers', 'here.But', 'am', 'ready', 'be', 'convinced', 'director', 'sent', 'up', 'dummy', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'sacrifice', 'own', 'son', 'soaring', 'rooftops', 'Paris', 'guy', 'claimed', 'did', 'recently', 'Fort', 'Collins', 'Colorado', 'home-made', 'weather', 'balloon', 'similarly', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'really', 'attic.That', 'was', 'publicity', 'stunt.This', 'eternal', 'art.And', 'children', 'bad', 'boys', 'end', 'little', 'girl', 'blue', 'balloon', 'struggle', 'authority', 'everything', 'amazing', 'child', 'it.You', 'will', 'believe', 'studied', 'Piaget.You', 'will', 'believe', 'boy', 'can', 'fly.Above', 'will', 'love', 'forever', '36', 'minute', 'film', 'play', 'again', 'even', 'children', 'cry', 'Enough', 'students', 'have', 'never', 'come', 'point', 'possible.I', 'guess.I', 'find', 'reproduction', 'here', 'excellent', 'clearer', 'copy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'soundtrack', 'clean', 'well', 'as', 'crisp', 'DVD', 'have', 'not', 'burned', 'off', 'bad', '16mm', 'copy', 'alleged', 'elsewhere', 'must', 'be', 'master', 'tape.But', 'still', 'as', 'hard', 'try', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'controlling', 'strings', 'final', 'descent', 'NO', 'SPOILER', 'HERE', 'love', 'film.I', 'do', 'too.And', 'so', 'will', 'you.Also', 'see', 'pleaseThe', 'White', 'Dove', 'aka', 'Holubice', '1960', 'generally', 'similar', 'hidden', 'subtext', 'rather', 'too', 'strong', 'children']",The Red Balloon VHS

As well as being enduring childhood classics, those two tales have certain themes in common, but whereas ""Old Yeller"" deals with a living creature, this tale breathes life into a normally inanimate object.My first encounter with ""Le Ballon Rouge"" was when it was shown to my kindergarten class in the mid-70s. I had no idea until years later that by that time, it was nearly 20 years old. Its appeal, nonetheless, is timeless.Using sparse dialogue, and Parisian locales, Director Albert Lamorisse presents the tale of a small boy (his son,Pascal)who finds a magical red balloon tied to a lamp post, and takes it home with him. Largely gray Paris gives the redness of the balloon an interesting and sharp onscreen contrast.Like a faithful dog, the the air-filled sphere with a string follows him everywhere, often on its own, and with an occasional exception, waits for him outside places where it is not allowed to enter. It obeys its master's commands, attracts attention in public, and has a brief flirtation with a blue balloon of a similar caliber, owned by a pretty little girl (the director's daughter, Sabine).But alas, the adventures of boy and balloon are abreviated due to a rowdy group of boys.But it is as though the balloon knew its time was short somehow, as if it knew it was meant to give its owner delight only for a little while and did so to the fullest.

Ever since then I had been wanting so badly to see it again, and finally I came across it on Amazon, and had to have it. I'm 13 now, but even though it may seem strange, the red balloon still makes me laugh as though I were still 5. No kid should grow up without watching the Red Balloon. It helps stimulate the imagination, as well as show you how bad things are in the world, when you have something, and others will stop at nothing to get it.When underpriveledged Pascal finds a large red balloon tied to a lamp post one early morning, he decides, why not take it with him to school. Things get complicated though. It seems as though the world around him is against balloons. He's not allowed to board the bus to school with it, the teacher won't allow it in the classroom, and his Mother bcomes mad at him for bringing it home. She soon throws it out the window, scolding him afterwords. But Pascal see's something out his bedroom window. It's the balloon! After bring it back in, he doesn't bother trying to figure out how it's alive, he's glad to have a friend finally, no matter who, or what it is. Maybe things won't be so bad after all. Or will they be?Producer, and writer Albert Lammorise should've gotten a nomination for best film of the year in 1956. It's an instant five stars. After watching the film, I felt a void like all kids might for the red balloon after he got popped. But it turns out, there is a sequel, which one a film festival award called the revenge of the red balloon. It gives you satisfaction for the balloon is back, and he goes around making sure that none of the boys (now men) that popped him so long ago, never see another day of their lives. It was just as hilarious as the first, maybe even funnier, but not so much for kids. The red balloon gets a whopping 5 stars for outstanding everything.

Boy and balloon hang out around Paris, despite others' efforts to separate them.I had put off seeing this because it sounded hilariously boring. (In fact, I believe that the old tv show ""The Critic"" had this movie as part of some kind of joke, insisting that it was the eponymous critic's favorite movie to exemplify his pomposity.) I wound up watching it the other day late at night because it was short and I wouldn't stay up...and was definitely wide awake afterwards. I won't go into too much detail about what happens in the film because it's so short, but I will say that I found it very enjoyable and I will watch it again sometime to get a better look at the effects used in giving the balloon personality, as well as the final scene. I'd say that the last scene, which is both a surprise and visually stunning, has been aped by the Bravia advertisements and innumerable directors. It's really unforgettable and even a bit shocking - quite refreshing for someone who has grown inured to CGI and other cinematic trickery.DVD print: I thought it was clear and the colors came across well, but the person watching it with me said the faces were a bit muddy and some of the scenery too dark. Not sure about the scenery claim, however, as I thought the streets of Paris were meant to look darker in contrast to the gloriously red and oddly oversized red balloon.

The balloon follows its new owner around Paris, and will stay when asked to. It even pursues a love interest at one point. Unfortunately, some ruffians want to destroy the balloon, possibly out of jealousy. The balloon is good at evasion, however, and the viewer is kept in suspense. The action culminates in a bittersweet conclusion which I won't reveal here.

He reminds me of myself as a five or six years old boy and I can identify with him only too well. This is, without the slightest doubt, the best children's film of all time.

It's fairly harmless--a little kid is followed all around some miserable, bombed out, French city by a vibrantly colored red balloon that he finds tied to a lamppost.  It eludes the grasp of others, but bobs and weaves all over the place so that the boy can tow it around.  After disrupting school and church it is finally hunted down by a gang of nearly feral French schoolchildren who stone it to death.  There follows the obligatory resurrection (the balloon having previously been immaculately conceived and crucified) as the boy is transported heavenwards by a host of balloons.  Hard to believe then how grating these 34 minutes of celluloid become by the end of the first viewing, never mind on the umpteenth.

I learned later this film won an Oscar that year (1956) for Best Foreign Film.  The actor I believe I read was the directors son.  He is magical and accounts for much of the joy in the film.  While captivated and engrossed immediately in the film I thought the ending way too harsh and unnecessary.  But then look at Dumbo or Bambi.  It seems the movies that make the most sharp and lasting impressions are ones that involve loss.  Only now in my 50's can I see the director was putting an overview of life on film - it always involves moments of intense passion, periods of devotion, and inevitably loss.

Decades after, I'm happy to say that it's even more magical & moving than I'd remembered. No doubt the sobering experience of growing up has added to the richness & depth of the deceptively simple story, which has the purity & directness of a parable. There's so much here! The innocence of childhood, the defiance of unfeeling authoriy, the individual vs. the mob, the power of the imagination -- and all of it told with a subtle touch that's as light as a feather. There's nothing heavy-handed or maudlin here. Pascal is treated with the dignity a sensitive child deserves, without any false sentimentality or condescension. And the ending is magnificent!Restored to its full Technicolor glory, drenched in color, and taking us on a wide-eyed tour of Paris in the 1950s, this Criterion release is a treasure. While we might have asked for DVD extras, there's really no need for them -- the film stands eloquently on its own.
