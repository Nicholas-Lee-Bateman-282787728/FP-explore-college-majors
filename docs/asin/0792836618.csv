137105,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792836618,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","Billy Crystal directs himself in this sometimes funny, sometimes sad, most times rather dull account of a washed up comedian's life and his struggle to get back into the swing of things after years of arrogant self-pandering.  I was really interested in where this was going to take me, since I'm a fan of Crystal, but only to a certain degree.  I find that his persona onscreen can become rather limited in range, and he's only a few times given me something I felt was fully fleshed out and complete (my favorite performance from his is easily `When Harry Met Sally') and many times he comes off like Tom Hanks-lite, but I was willing to try this since he was so invested in every aspect of it (writing, directing, starring).  If any vehicle was going to give me the best Crystal had to offer, it was going to be this.Sadly, his co-star David Paymer wipes the floor with him.The film tells the life story of a Jewish comedian with a poor attitude and a penchant for racy, edgy and offensive comedy.  He is stubborn and determined, which go hand in hand into making him a star, and a somewhat beloved one at that, but times are hard and age catches up with you and before you know it your career doesn't exist anymore.  Still completely set in his ways, and narrow minded in his self-perception, Buddy cares little for anyone else, including his brother, who just so happens to be the only loyal friend Buddy ever had (even though Buddy walks all over him).This could have been ripe for true impact, but the scenes get lost in the shoddy editing, and the big moments feel too staged to be anything really moving (although the whole sub-plot with the movie pitch and the heartbreak is rather impressive).  Crystal is one note here, which is sad since his character had so many moments where an arc could have been played.  Paymer is great though, and I'm happy he snagged that Oscar nomination for this.  He said so much with a single glance and gave a three-dimensional heart to an otherwise stagnant picture.",3,It has all the pieces; it just fails to put them together...,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,2010,"['Billy', 'Crystal', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'most', 'times', 'rather', 'dull', 'account', 'washed', 'up', 'comedian', 'life', 'struggle', 'get', 'back', 'swing', 'things', 'years', 'arrogant', 'self-pandering', 'was', 'really', 'interested', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'take', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Crystal', 'only', 'certain', 'degree', 'find', 'persona', 'onscreen', 'can', 'become', 'rather', 'limited', 'range', 'only', 'few', 'times', 'given', 'something', 'felt', 'was', 'fully', 'fleshed', 'out', 'complete', 'favorite', 'performance', 'easily', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'many', 'times', 'Tom', 'Hanks-lite', 'was', 'willing', 'try', 'was', 'so', 'invested', 'aspect', 'writing', 'directing', 'starring', 'vehicle', 'was', 'going', 'give', 'best', 'Crystal', 'had', 'offer', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'this.Sadly', 'co-star', 'David', 'Paymer', 'floor', 'him.The', 'film', 'life', 'story', 'Jewish', 'comedian', 'poor', 'attitude', 'penchant', 'racy', 'edgy', 'offensive', 'comedy', 'stubborn', 'determined', 'go', 'hand', 'hand', 'making', 'star', 'somewhat', 'beloved', 'one', 'times', 'are', 'hard', 'age', 'catches', 'up', 'know', 'career', ""n't"", 'exist', 'anymore', 'Still', 'completely', 'set', 'ways', 'narrow', 'minded', 'self-perception', 'Buddy', 'little', 'anyone', 'else', 'including', 'brother', 'who', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'only', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Buddy', 'ever', 'had', 'even', 'Buddy', 'walks', '.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ripe', 'true', 'impact', 'scenes', 'get', 'lost', 'shoddy', 'editing', 'big', 'moments', 'feel', 'too', 'staged', 'be', 'anything', 'really', 'moving', 'whole', 'sub-plot', 'movie', 'pitch', 'heartbreak', 'rather', 'impressive', 'Crystal', 'one', 'note', 'here', 'sad', 'character', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'moments', 'where', 'arc', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'Paymer', 'great', ""'m"", 'happy', 'snagged', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'said', 'so', 'much', 'single', 'glance', 'gave', 'three-dimensional', 'heart', 'otherwise', 'stagnant', 'picture']",Mr. Saturday Night VHS

The movie starts off slowly and seemingly predictably, with Crystal and his brother (played by David Paymer) doing comedy together in their Jewish living room to all the relatives, getting some early breaks, and heading up the showbiz ladder. But Paymer opts out of the routine and becomes Cyrstal's manager. After many years and now on the decline, they have a falling out, but reconcile at the end. Comedians have enormous egos, and Crystal as Buddy wouldn't think twice about putting someone down for a laugh. (I've heard the same thing said about the real life Groucho Marx, whose insults directed as his family were funny to everyone except his family. But he didn't care as long as he got a laugh.) He's a funny guy, Buddy is, but not a nice one. The second half of the movie is much better than the first.

137112,A2KBEW2GOSLS3X,0792836618,Larry C,"[6, 8]","I have always felt Billy Crystal was a self absorbed, ruthless, know it all, Borcht belt brat, ego maniac! So when this movie was conceived (as a vehicle for Crystal) I thought it was merely an attempt to convince us that he himself was a showbiz legend. You know.....so he could show up at the Friars club and get respect from some former comedians who make cameo appearances in this flick. Greats like Slappy White, Carl Ballantine, Will Jordan, Jackie Gayle, and the master himself.....Jerry Lewis. Well.....I hate to say this.....but I now believe that I was wrong. I have since found Billy to indeed be a Showbiz legend! I now put him not only equal to but above many of the greats. I mean he's right up there with Lewis, Jack Benny, and George Burns. He turns in a great effort here as the abrasive, controlling, manipulative and unlovable Buddy Young. But the icing on the cake on why I changed my mind was the solid writing and unselfish way Crystal so generously gives David Payner this movie. It is for that reason and Payner's rock solid performance as the long suffering brother that make this Showbiz yarn a must see for any and all people who ever dreamed of being a standup comedian. This movie peels away and exposes the underlying current as to what makes a man bulldoze anybody who get's in his way from being a star. It's at times crass and vulgar but then that's who Buddy Young is. An underrated masterful little gem from one of the greatest entertainers today.....my ""new"" favorite comedian.

137116,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0792836618,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[7, 11]","What a gyp - ""Mr. Saturday Night"" is supposed to be at least either heartwarming or funny, but is neither.  Billy Crystal is Buddy Young, one of the sort of old time Jewish comics who got his start in the postwar ""borscht belt"".  When the flick opens up, Buddy old yet still going strong - perhaps a bit too strong.  Still playing gigs, it's clear that Buddy has missed out on big success despite a lifetime of hard work.  Record deals and primetime haven't elevated Young to the pantheon of American entertainment like Sid Ceaser or Jerry Lewis.  Instead, he plays rest homes and (when he's lucky) cruise ships.  Though married, Buddy's true companion is his long suffering brother, Stan (David Paymer).  In flashbacks, we learn that Buddy and Stan were originally supposed to have been a team, but Stan backed out at the last minute - leaving Buddy to accept the spotlight.  The attention, which gave Buddy fame at first, only produced resentment later on.  At first a primetime draw, Buddy's show eventually sank in the ratings (Davy Crockett killed him).  A shot at comeback on the Sullivan show turned disastrous - he shared the bill with the Beatles.  Various attempts to cash in on the latest craze each ended in failure (when was the last time you dusted off your LP of ""Disco Jew""?).  Though Buddy seems resolute to go on, each failure erodes a veneer within him, exposing Buddy's nastier side, one that drives away all but his closest relatives, and makes life hell even for them.  Though covering years of Buddy's life in flashback, the plot centers around what may be a new break - when a new agent (Helen Hunt) manages to snag for Buddy a promising role in a movie to be directed by a young Buddy fan (played by Ron Silver).Ofcourse nothing works out - but that's not the movie's problem.  Instead, the flick pulls strings shamelessly, using the same tricks that made ""A League of their Own"" look contrived and very Hollywood.  Whether the swelling music or the tears, nothing looks real in this movie.  What really kills this flick?  The script plays either very funny or very sad, but forgets (or simply never understood) that real Jewish humor is both at the same time - only wearing different faces, but essentially both heartbreaking and hysterically funny at the same time.  Instead, the flick never manages to reconcile how such a nasty guy can be both funny and mean and just makes him too separate characters - unfortunately, the mean and less entertaining one gets most of the screen time.  If the flick had played it lighter on both counts, it may not have been as funny, but it would have been more poignant and believable.",3,"Too mean to be funny, and too funny to be meaningful",1021161600,"05 12, 2002",2002,2648,"['What', 'gyp', 'Mr.', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'supposed', 'be', 'least', 'heartwarming', 'funny', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'Buddy', 'Young', 'one', 'sort', 'old', 'time', 'Jewish', 'comics', 'who', 'got', 'start', 'postwar', 'borscht', 'belt', 'When', 'flick', 'up', 'Buddy', 'old', 'yet', 'still', 'going', 'strong', 'perhaps', 'bit', 'too', 'strong', 'Still', 'playing', 'gigs', 'clear', 'Buddy', 'missed', 'out', 'big', 'success', 'lifetime', 'hard', 'work', 'Record', 'deals', 'primetime', 'have', ""n't"", 'elevated', 'Young', 'pantheon', 'American', 'entertainment', 'Sid', 'Ceaser', 'Jerry', 'Lewis', 'Instead', 'rest', 'homes', 'when', 'lucky', 'cruise', 'ships', 'Though', 'married', 'Buddy', 'true', 'companion', 'long', 'suffering', 'brother', 'Stan', 'David', 'Paymer', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'Buddy', 'Stan', 'were', 'originally', 'supposed', 'have', 'been', 'team', 'Stan', 'backed', 'out', 'last', 'minute', 'leaving', 'Buddy', 'accept', 'spotlight', 'attention', 'gave', 'Buddy', 'fame', 'first', 'only', 'produced', 'resentment', 'later', 'first', 'primetime', 'draw', 'Buddy', 'show', 'eventually', 'sank', 'ratings', 'Davy', 'Crockett', 'killed', 'shot', 'comeback', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'turned', 'disastrous', 'shared', 'bill', 'Beatles', 'Various', 'attempts', 'cash', 'latest', 'craze', 'ended', 'failure', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'dusted', 'off', 'LP', 'Disco', 'Jew', 'Buddy', 'resolute', 'go', 'failure', 'veneer', 'exposing', 'Buddy', 'nastier', 'side', 'one', 'away', 'closest', 'relatives', 'life', 'hell', 'even', 'covering', 'years', 'Buddy', 'life', 'flashback', 'plot', 'centers', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'new', 'break', 'when', 'new', 'agent', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'snag', 'Buddy', 'promising', 'role', 'movie', 'be', 'directed', 'young', 'Buddy', 'fan', 'played', 'Ron', 'Silver', 'nothing', 'out', 'not', 'movie', 'problem', 'Instead', 'flick', 'strings', 'shamelessly', 'using', 'same', 'tricks', 'made', 'A', 'League', 'Own', 'look', 'contrived', 'very', 'Hollywood', 'swelling', 'music', 'tears', 'nothing', 'looks', 'real', 'movie', 'What', 'really', 'flick', 'script', 'very', 'funny', 'very', 'sad', 'forgets', 'simply', 'never', 'understood', 'real', 'Jewish', 'humor', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'wearing', 'different', 'essentially', 'heartbreaking', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'same', 'time', 'Instead', 'flick', 'never', 'reconcile', 'how', 'such', 'nasty', 'guy', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'mean', 'just', 'too', 'separate', 'characters', 'unfortunately', 'mean', 'less', 'entertaining', 'one', 'most', 'screen', 'time', 'flick', 'had', 'played', 'lighter', 'counts', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'funny', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'poignant', 'believable']",Mr. Saturday Night VHS
