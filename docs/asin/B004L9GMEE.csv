I've seen Jones in minor roles as the big guy Goliath who falls to a smaller but more skilled fighter - in Troy to Brad Pitt's Achilles, in Fearless to Jet Li's Huo Yuanjia, in The Protector to Tony Jaa's elephant advocate. Enjoyable to watch him play a major role, which is light on the dialogue but mostly physical comedy. And he's great at it. Curious if there was any conscious intent by the writer or director to give a nod to Curly from the Stooges.So why the two-star hate? The teen Muai Thai champion story line is overdone, which would have worked out if this was a Disney movie, but there was too much violence for that. Most of all, the bad guys were really aweful.

1413026,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004L9GMEE,Mark Turner,"[1, 1]","Never let it be said that foreign countries don't make anything other than action films or deep, depressing dramas. Many have the idea that with the exception of martial arts films those are all they offer. In point of fact there are many great films coming out of other countries that we should open our eyes too. Unfortunately this might not be one of them though this could be one to get kids to do so.MUAY THAI GIANT is one of the combinations of martial arts flick, comedy and crime story that come out of the oriental film market. Touted as being made by the producers behind THE PROTECTOR, the movie stars muscleman Nathan Jones as a down on his luck tourist in Thailand. Drugged and robbed of his money and passport, he befriends a young girl (a small time thief) when she is set upon by thugs. One would think he would come to her rescue but she's actually saved by her butt kicking sister, a muay thai fighter. Feeling for Jones they take him home.The big lug does his best to help around the house. He's tall and strong so he can do a few things. Their mother wants her daughter not to fight so she's doing her best to support the family with a beachside food shack. When Jones has a bite of her somtom (an incredibly spicy concoction) he turns a bright shade of red and goes berserk destroying the shack she sells from. Now they need to find a way to make money fast and the only way they can do so is if his new friend fights.Here again you would think this would lead to Jones being a big fighter but that never ends up being the case. Instead the girl is set up by the promoter and short changed when it comes time to pay up. But her sister has nabbed a special key being used by drug smugglers to open a laser encrypted lock. Now the bad guys go after the trio to get back the key.Dubbing aside this movie is slow paced at times but that could just be the always popular ""lost in translation"" style found in some foreign films. The character Jones plays is sympathetic and heroic in his own way, coming to fighting mode once given the secret spicy food somtom. It sort of reminds you of when Curly of the Three Stooges would get a whiff of limburger cheese and go nuts.The film, though crime scenes involved and a few blood scenes from gunshots, seems more in line with teens than with small children or adults. The problem there comes from teens in this country (U.S.) unwilling to accept anything not set here or in the style they're used to. Will teens and pre-teens accept these actors and their situations? Perhaps not but they won't be exposed to anything non-U.S.centric if not given the opportunity.This film would present that without going towards the more adult fare being offered.The movie is fun in some parts, action packed with the fighting sequences and touching in others. It's not the worst movie ever but it's also not the best. Does it show promise for its star? Not in this country but maybe in more films like these overseas. It does make an interesting look at what other countries are doing though and that's always worth making a movie worth watching.",3,FOREIGN FUNNY,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,3092,"['Never', 'let', 'be', 'said', 'foreign', 'countries', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'anything', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'deep', 'depressing', 'dramas', 'Many', 'have', 'idea', 'exception', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'are', 'offer', 'point', 'fact', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'films', 'coming', 'other', 'countries', 'should', 'open', 'eyes', 'too', 'Unfortunately', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'one', 'get', 'kids', 'do', 'so.MUAY', 'THAI', 'GIANT', 'one', 'combinations', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'comedy', 'crime', 'story', 'oriental', 'film', 'market', 'Touted', 'being', 'made', 'producers', 'THE', 'PROTECTOR', 'movie', 'muscleman', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'down', 'luck', 'tourist', 'Thailand', 'Drugged', 'robbed', 'money', 'passport', 'young', 'girl', 'small', 'time', 'thief', 'when', 'set', 'thugs', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'come', 'rescue', 'actually', 'saved', 'butt', 'kicking', 'sister', 'muay', 'thai', 'fighter', 'Feeling', 'Jones', 'take', 'home.The', 'big', 'lug', 'best', 'help', 'house', 'tall', 'strong', 'so', 'can', 'do', 'few', 'things', 'mother', 'daughter', 'not', 'fight', 'doing', 'best', 'support', 'family', 'beachside', 'food', 'shack', 'When', 'Jones', 'bite', 'somtom', 'incredibly', 'spicy', 'concoction', 'bright', 'shade', 'red', 'berserk', 'destroying', 'shack', 'Now', 'need', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'fast', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'new', 'friend', 'fights.Here', 'again', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'lead', 'Jones', 'being', 'big', 'fighter', 'never', 'up', 'being', 'case', 'Instead', 'girl', 'set', 'up', 'promoter', 'short', 'changed', 'when', 'time', 'pay', 'up', 'sister', 'nabbed', 'special', 'key', 'being', 'used', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'open', 'laser', 'encrypted', 'lock', 'Now', 'bad', 'guys', 'go', 'trio', 'get', 'back', 'key.Dubbing', 'aside', 'movie', 'slow', 'paced', 'times', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'always', 'popular', 'lost', 'translation', 'style', 'found', 'foreign', 'films', 'character', 'Jones', 'plays', 'sympathetic', 'heroic', 'own', 'way', 'coming', 'fighting', 'mode', 'once', 'given', 'secret', 'spicy', 'food', 'somtom', 'sort', 'reminds', 'when', 'Curly', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'would', 'get', 'whiff', 'limburger', 'cheese', 'go', 'nuts.The', 'film', 'crime', 'scenes', 'involved', 'few', 'blood', 'scenes', 'gunshots', 'more', 'line', 'teens', 'small', 'children', 'adults', 'problem', 'there', 'teens', 'country', 'U.S.', 'unwilling', 'accept', 'anything', 'not', 'set', 'here', 'style', ""'re"", 'used', 'Will', 'pre-teens', 'actors', 'situations', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'exposed', 'anything', 'non-U.S.centric', 'not', 'given', 'opportunity.This', 'film', 'would', 'present', 'going', 'more', 'adult', 'fare', 'being', 'offered.The', 'movie', 'fun', 'parts', 'action', 'packed', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'touching', 'others', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'ever', 'also', 'not', 'best', 'show', 'promise', 'star', 'Not', 'country', 'maybe', 'more', 'films', 'overseas', 'make', 'interesting', 'look', 'what', 'other', 'countries', 'are', 'doing', 'always', 'worth', 'making', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A
1413027,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B004L9GMEE,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[3, 4]","""Muay Thai Giant"" here (or ""Somtum,"" which is a more apt title) is a pretty unique movie for giving the spotlight to a performer who thus far had been limited to henchman/enforcer/support-villain status throughout his film career - namely that giant among men, Nathan Jones. What's more, it places him in a fairly unique role, or at least one that few people would expect after seeing him inThe Protector. Its DVD cover is slightly misleading as to informing you who the real action star of the picture is, but nevertheless, it's still a surprisingly watchable movie. It doesn't really throw any surprises at you, but for its scale and premise, it's thoroughly entertaining.The story: possessing ""the body of a giant but the heart of an ant,"" Barney Emerald (Jones) is robbed of his passport while visiting Thailand and subsequently finds himself caught up in both the lives of a fatherless family and the dealings of an underworld circle looking to sell a piece of criminal technology. Only when he realizes and masters the raging power he wields upon eating a spicy somtum dish will he be able to help the former and take on the latter.While anybody can imagine Jones playing the part of a raging red hulk (he literally changes color upon eating that papaya salad), it's more difficult to imagine him playing a meek character prior to that who doesn't know how to fight. This is true for anyone who's seen him in other movies; it's doubly true for anyone who witnessed his years as a pro wrestler; it's triply true for anyone who knows that he earlier in life had gone to prison for no less than eight armed robberies; and it's practically unthinkable for most everyone who just looks at the man and sees that he's seven feet tall with a bodybuilder's physique.  However, through an amount of dramatic talent that I know he's never going to be recognized for, Jones succeeds...for the most part. The tender, playful scenes he shares with some characters come naturally, so that for the first time in a movie he actually seems like a likable guy. However, his physique alone sort of defies that he's written as a physically ineffectual scaredy-cat: this is the sort of man who'd break your bones on accident during everyday events, and thus it's hard to believe that he could ever be 100% defenseless, even when he's ganged up on.Then again, the filmmakers likely stressed this point because, contrary to what the DVD cover would have you assume, Jones only has two fights in the movie, both of which don't occur until almost the very end of the picture. Most of the previous four fights are picked up by junior boxing champion Sassia Jimdamanwee (Power Kids), who's an action heroine in the making if I ever saw one: though her first fight features the most blatant use of wirework I've ever seen in a Thai film and is terribly mediocre, her subsequent two fights against Than Srisuke (The Hangover Part II) are more than satisfying. Dan Chupong (Ong Bak 3) plays a character in the first half of the film and leads a very nice three-on-one fight in a kitchen, and tae kwon do starlet Kessarin Ektawatkul (Born to Fight) takes part in a street fight with Sassia. Though Nathan Jones' two fights feature minimal martial arts and are clearly styled after pro wrestling matches (even featuring fellow grapplers Sylvester Terkay, Luther Reigns, and Tom Howard), the choreography is impressive and the physicality looks painful. Cumulatively, this may not be Panna Rittikrai's best work, but it's still pretty good.Because this is both a comedy and a Thai film, we're also treated to some remarkably absurd scenes, such as Jones training in kickboxing with a small boy and taking part in an imaginary striptease scene. In a worst case scenario, scenes like these would make a viewer think less of Jones and his previous powerhouse performances, but personally, I think a part like this gives him more dimension as an actor. I don't know if he's meant to be a leading man, but I definitely wouldn't mind seeing him in a few more large roles in the future. Check it out, if you like some surreality with your action.",4,"""It must be the big guy who caused trouble...""",1350345600,"10 16, 2012",2012,4111,"['Muay', 'Thai', 'Giant', 'here', 'Somtum', 'more', 'apt', 'title', 'pretty', 'unique', 'movie', 'giving', 'spotlight', 'performer', 'who', 'thus', 'far', 'had', 'been', 'limited', 'henchman/enforcer/support-villain', 'status', 'film', 'career', 'namely', 'giant', 'men', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'What', 'more', 'fairly', 'unique', 'role', 'least', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'seeing', 'inThe', 'Protector', 'DVD', 'cover', 'slightly', 'misleading', 'informing', 'who', 'real', 'action', 'star', 'picture', 'nevertheless', 'still', 'surprisingly', 'watchable', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'throw', 'surprises', 'scale', 'premise', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining.The', 'story', 'possessing', 'body', 'giant', 'heart', 'ant', 'Barney', 'Emerald', 'Jones', 'robbed', 'passport', 'visiting', 'Thailand', 'subsequently', 'caught', 'up', 'lives', 'fatherless', 'family', 'dealings', 'underworld', 'circle', 'looking', 'sell', 'piece', 'criminal', 'technology', 'Only', 'when', 'raging', 'power', 'eating', 'spicy', 'somtum', 'dish', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'former', 'take', 'latter.While', 'anybody', 'can', 'imagine', 'Jones', 'playing', 'part', 'raging', 'red', 'hulk', 'literally', 'color', 'eating', 'papaya', 'salad', 'more', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'playing', 'meek', 'character', 'prior', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'fight', 'true', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'other', 'movies', 'doubly', 'true', 'anyone', 'who', 'witnessed', 'years', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'triply', 'true', 'anyone', 'who', 'earlier', 'life', 'had', 'gone', 'prison', 'less', 'eight', 'armed', 'robberies', 'practically', 'unthinkable', 'most', 'everyone', 'who', 'just', 'man', 'seven', 'feet', 'tall', 'bodybuilder', 'physique', 'However', 'amount', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'know', 'never', 'going', 'be', 'recognized', 'Jones', 'most', 'part', 'tender', 'playful', 'scenes', 'shares', 'characters', 'come', 'naturally', 'first', 'time', 'movie', 'actually', 'likable', 'guy', 'However', 'physique', 'alone', 'sort', 'defies', 'written', 'physically', 'ineffectual', 'scaredy-cat', 'sort', 'man', 'who', ""'d"", 'break', 'bones', 'accident', 'everyday', 'events', 'thus', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'ever', 'be', '100', '%', 'defenseless', 'even', 'when', 'ganged', 'up', 'on.Then', 'again', 'filmmakers', 'likely', 'stressed', 'point', 'contrary', 'what', 'DVD', 'cover', 'would', 'have', 'assume', 'Jones', 'only', 'two', 'fights', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'occur', 'almost', 'very', 'end', 'picture', 'Most', 'previous', 'four', 'fights', 'are', 'picked', 'up', 'junior', 'boxing', 'champion', 'Sassia', 'Jimdamanwee', 'Power', 'Kids', 'who', 'action', 'heroine', 'making', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'first', 'fight', 'most', 'blatant', 'use', 'wirework', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Thai', 'film', 'terribly', 'mediocre', 'subsequent', 'two', 'fights', 'Than', 'Srisuke', 'Hangover', 'Part', 'II', 'are', 'more', 'satisfying', 'Dan', 'Chupong', 'Ong', 'Bak', '3', 'character', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'three-on-one', 'fight', 'kitchen', 'tae', 'kwon', 'do', 'starlet', 'Kessarin', 'Ektawatkul', 'Born', 'Fight', 'part', 'street', 'fight', 'Sassia', 'Though', 'Nathan', 'Jones', 'two', 'fights', 'feature', 'minimal', 'martial', 'arts', 'are', 'clearly', 'styled', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'matches', 'even', 'featuring', 'fellow', 'grapplers', 'Sylvester', 'Terkay', 'Luther', 'Reigns', 'Tom', 'Howard', 'choreography', 'impressive', 'physicality', 'painful', 'Cumulatively', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Panna', 'Rittikrai', 'best', 'work', 'still', 'pretty', 'good.Because', 'comedy', 'Thai', 'film', ""'re"", 'also', 'treated', 'remarkably', 'absurd', 'scenes', 'such', 'Jones', 'training', 'kickboxing', 'small', 'boy', 'taking', 'part', 'imaginary', 'striptease', 'scene', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'scenes', 'would', 'make', 'viewer', 'think', 'less', 'Jones', 'previous', 'powerhouse', 'performances', 'personally', 'think', 'part', 'more', 'dimension', 'actor', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'meant', 'be', 'leading', 'man', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'few', 'more', 'large', 'roles', 'future', 'Check', 'out', 'like', 'surreality', 'action']",N/A
