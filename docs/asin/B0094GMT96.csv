However, my 15 month old twins have a hard time paying attention to this DVD. We have Yummy, Yummy, and Wiggle Time which they absolutely love, but I think because the concert doesn't have the close ups of the set and the colors aren't as bright as a fixed studio production, even the songs my kids like that are on this DVD, don't hold their attention very well. The Wiggles developed a simple formula that has made them the success they are. One of those keys was being able to look directly into the camera and talk/sing directly to the kids through the lens. You lose this intimacy in their concert DVD's as the camera angles often have to go wide to capture all the action. Maybe when my kids are older, they might appreciate this DVD. I only rated as &#34;ok&#34; because my kids are not interested in it yet. Doesn't mean that they won't love it later, but at 15 months, there are better Wiggle DVD choices",3,15 month olds not into Wiggles Concerts yet,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",2014,1059,"['wanted', 'DVD', 'was', 'last', 'live', 'concert', 'original', 'Wiggles', 'cast', 'family', 'grown', 'love', 'last', 'few', 'months', 'However', '15', 'month', 'old', 'twins', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'paying', 'attention', 'DVD', 'have', 'Yummy', 'Yummy', 'Wiggle', 'Time', 'absolutely', 'love', 'think', 'concert', ""n't"", 'have', 'close', 'ups', 'set', 'colors', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bright', 'fixed', 'studio', 'production', 'even', 'songs', 'kids', 'are', 'DVD', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'attention', 'very', 'well', 'Wiggles', 'developed', 'simple', 'formula', 'made', 'success', 'are', 'One', 'keys', 'was', 'being', 'able', 'look', 'directly', 'camera', 'talk/sing', 'directly', 'kids', 'lens', 'lose', 'intimacy', 'concert', 'DVD', 'camera', 'angles', 'often', 'have', 'go', 'wide', 'capture', 'action', 'Maybe', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'older', 'might', 'appreciate', 'DVD', 'only', 'rated', '34', '34', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'interested', 'yet', ""n't"", 'mean', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'later', '15', 'months', 'are', 'better', 'Wiggle', 'DVD', 'choices']",The Wiggles: The Wiggles Celebration

My son is a big fan of the Wiggles and we watch these videos endlessly. This DVD was a very good deal at $8.48 and also since we have Amazon Prime we got free 2 day shipping. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone that has kids. The Wiggles are always energetic and the songs are always entertaining.&#34;The Wiggles Celebration&#34; is the fourtieth Wiggles video. It's the seventh live concert video, after Big Big Show!  It contains concert footage from Dublin, Ireland.  It marks the last appearances of Greg, Murray and Jeff, before the new generation (Simon Pryce, Lachlan Gillespie, Emma Watkins) of the Wiggles take over for Greg, Murray and Jeff.

Reed,"[1, 3]","First off this isn't the last show they did, that one was in Australia, and if you've seen some of the final tour on You Tube you might be wondering where some of the fun went. The DVD is a quick tight run of the songs but it has none of the between song banter and joking that makes Wiggles shows that much more fun, even the little bit explaining why the Wiggles were in the audience to collect roses for Dorothy and bones for Waggs would have been sweet instead of cutting away to the park and street scenes. Still it was good for a Wiggles show and they looked happy to be there. The smaller cast of about a dozen looks to have fun with each other, as much as I liked Sam he just doesn't have the same energy as Greg.For the times some camera angles could have been a bit better there were a couple of interesting ones that would have been a neat addition as an optional feature. It looks as if they put a camera in Captain Feathersword's hat giving us glimpses of the view from the stage. When Murray heads to the audience to collect roses a camera follows him too. Hopefully they'll use the idea of giving us a Wiggles eye view of things later, it was really neat.",4,Did they edit some of the fun out?,1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1170,"['First', ""n't"", 'last', 'show', 'did', 'one', 'was', 'Australia', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'final', 'tour', 'Tube', 'might', 'be', 'wondering', 'where', 'fun', 'went', 'DVD', 'quick', 'tight', 'run', 'songs', 'none', 'song', 'banter', 'joking', 'Wiggles', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'even', 'little', 'bit', 'explaining', 'why', 'Wiggles', 'were', 'audience', 'collect', 'roses', 'Dorothy', 'bones', 'Waggs', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'sweet', 'instead', 'cutting', 'away', 'park', 'street', 'scenes', 'Still', 'was', 'good', 'Wiggles', 'show', 'looked', 'happy', 'be', 'there', 'smaller', 'cast', 'dozen', 'have', 'fun', 'other', 'as', 'much', 'liked', 'Sam', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'energy', 'Greg.For', 'times', 'camera', 'angles', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'better', 'were', 'couple', 'interesting', 'ones', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'neat', 'addition', 'optional', 'feature', 'put', 'camera', 'Captain', 'Feathersword', 'hat', 'giving', 'glimpses', 'view', 'stage', 'When', 'Murray', 'audience', 'collect', 'camera', 'too', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'use', 'idea', 'giving', 'Wiggles', 'eye', 'view', 'things', 'later', 'was', 'really', 'neat']",The Wiggles: The Wiggles Celebration

After watching the dvd of their last concert I was not only sad that the Wiggles are over, but could completely see why. Obviously they are older now. I understand they are in their mid 50s and up. However, they moved around like they are MUCH older. Except for Anthony who has always been a bit of a ham for attention. And the concert footage was a bit boring. They used to do it up 'big' but the stage set was small and the 'antics' just weren't there. They also didn't do many of their original hits. We have over 25 Wiggles dvds. We have Wiggles toys and room d&eacute;cor. After watching the dvd,  I see why they are retiring.
