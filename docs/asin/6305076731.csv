The chemistry between Aniston and Rudd is on fire! They are so cute and gentle with each other, too bad Rudd plays a young, attractive gay man. Nina (Aniston) falls head over heels in love with George (Rudd) and she is pregnant with her ex-boyfriend's baby but she wants George to raise the unborn baby as his own. Although this movie does fall toward the cheesy side, this movie is still worth owning. If you love Jennifer Aniston then this movie is for you.

It is sweet, touching, funny, and well performed.Jennifer Aniston is perfectly cast as the lead character, Nina Borowski, and gives an excellent performance that making the viewer feel what she's feeling.  Paul Rudd, as her roommate and eventual love interest, is very appealing too.  (In my opinion, he doesn't really seem gay, but then again he doesn't really need to.  As long as the viewer just accepts the fact that he IS, it works.) John Pankow is great as Nina's irritating boyfriend, Vince.  And of course, Nigel Hawthorne does a wonderful job as Rodney.  Big surprise.The best scene in the film is a scene where Nina's overbearing sister, Constance (Allison Janney), descends on Nina and George along with her equally annoying husband (Alan Alda) and daughter (Lauren Pratt).  It is so funny, and so well acted.All in all, The Object Of My Affection rates five stars in my book.  Granted, there are some clunky bits in the script (as mentioned in the editorial review), and some bits that require suspension of belief.  But those things are easy to ignore, and more than likely, you'll want to watch this film over and over again.",5,A lovely movie,1067904000,"11 4, 2003",2003,1282,"['have', 'watched', 'Object', 'My', 'Affection', 'numerous', 'times', ""'re"", 'always', 'running', 'ABC', 'Family', 'Channel', 'have', 'yet', 'tire', 'sweet', 'touching', 'funny', 'well', 'performed.Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'lead', 'character', 'Nina', 'Borowski', 'excellent', 'performance', 'making', 'viewer', 'feel', 'what', 'feeling', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'roommate', 'eventual', 'love', 'interest', 'very', 'appealing', 'too', 'opinion', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'gay', 'then', 'again', ""n't"", 'really', 'need', 'As', 'long', 'viewer', 'just', 'fact', 'John', 'Pankow', 'great', 'Nina', 'irritating', 'boyfriend', 'Vince', 'course', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Rodney', 'Big', 'surprise.The', 'best', 'scene', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'Nina', 'overbearing', 'sister', 'Constance', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Nina', 'George', 'equally', 'annoying', 'husband', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'daughter', 'Lauren', 'Pratt', 'so', 'funny', 'so', 'well', 'acted.All', 'Object', 'My', 'Affection', 'rates', 'five', 'stars', 'book', 'Granted', 'are', 'clunky', 'bits', 'script', 'mentioned', 'editorial', 'review', 'bits', 'require', 'suspension', 'belief', 'things', 'are', 'easy', 'ignore', 'more', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'want', 'watch', 'film', 'over', 'again']",Object of My Affection VHS

The film was not directed towards me.  This is a gay film, which is not a criticism at all but merely that the audience is that and not straight men.  Every scene is crafted to that end.  Moreover, the wondrous Jennifer Aniston that many of us came to adore from other films and Friends is not present.  She's on the screen, to be sure, but the mature, sultry, even sexy Ms. Anniston is AWOL; in her place is a vulnerable, insecure sensitive single who must choose between 'traditional' and...'differently oriented', i.e. straight vs. gay.To sum up, if you like the idea of a woman having to decide between a sensitive, caring gay man vs. a 'normal guy' who has 'it all' except for any heart or personality, then this is an excellent portrayal and you should love it.  If, on the other hand, you were looking for a romantic comedy with the gorgeous Jennifer Aniston as the lovable vamp, then by all means buy one of her latest films which are all of that and more.  This is a poignant character portrayal only...Sidebar: I could have sworn this film was 'rated' R when I bought it; I note it now has no rating shown.

446855,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6305076731,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","This movie is about relationships, both in number and variety. There are multiple gay relationships, dysfunctional mother-daughter relationships, a bad boyfriend-girlfriend and a deep one between a gay man and a woman. Jennifer Aniston plays Nina, a young woman with a boyfriend that even male jerks would find annoying. When George, a gay man played by Paul Rudd moves in as Nina's roommate, Nina and George become very close, but only as friends. They do a lot of holding; snuggling and what would generally be pre and post-sex behavior but never reach the point of execution.When Nina discovers that she is pregnant, she wants George to fill the role of the father rather than the biological one. This works well early in the pregnancy but then George meets Paul, the gay companion of an older theatre critic. They quickly become lovers, which creates a separation between Nina and George, for Nina had the hope that George would forever remain hers.As the movie plays out, other characters appear, including Nina's parents, one of which is an insufferable mother that is so irritating that you find yourself wishing she would get a pie in the face or seltzer down her skirt. As the relationship process continues, everyone tries to find and enter his or her niche in the overall scheme as Nina moves closer to delivery. It ends with almost everyone making nice, a reasonably happy ending where there is some dissatisfaction, yet it is about as happy as it could possibly have been.While the movie has some high points, it drags at times as the producers feel it necessary to over-establish the characters. There are many times when several seconds could have been cut with no reduction in understanding or impact.",3,"Most of the characters are overly-established, making the events too slow moving",1278288000,"07 5, 2010",2010,1717,"['movie', 'relationships', 'number', 'variety', 'are', 'multiple', 'gay', 'relationships', 'dysfunctional', 'mother-daughter', 'relationships', 'bad', 'boyfriend-girlfriend', 'deep', 'one', 'gay', 'man', 'woman', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Nina', 'young', 'woman', 'boyfriend', 'even', 'jerks', 'would', 'find', 'annoying', 'When', 'George', 'gay', 'man', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Nina', 'roommate', 'Nina', 'George', 'become', 'very', 'close', 'only', 'friends', 'do', 'lot', 'holding', 'snuggling', 'what', 'would', 'generally', 'be', 'pre', 'post-sex', 'behavior', 'never', 'reach', 'point', 'execution.When', 'Nina', 'discovers', 'pregnant', 'George', 'fill', 'role', 'father', 'rather', 'biological', 'one', 'well', 'early', 'pregnancy', 'then', 'George', 'meets', 'Paul', 'gay', 'companion', 'older', 'theatre', 'critic', 'quickly', 'become', 'lovers', 'separation', 'Nina', 'George', 'Nina', 'had', 'hope', 'George', 'would', 'forever', 'remain', 'hers.As', 'movie', 'out', 'other', 'characters', 'appear', 'including', 'Nina', 'parents', 'one', 'insufferable', 'mother', 'so', 'irritating', 'find', 'wishing', 'would', 'get', 'pie', 'face', 'seltzer', 'down', 'skirt', 'relationship', 'process', 'everyone', 'tries', 'find', 'enter', 'niche', 'overall', 'scheme', 'Nina', 'closer', 'delivery', 'almost', 'everyone', 'making', 'nice', 'reasonably', 'happy', 'ending', 'where', 'dissatisfaction', 'as', 'happy', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'been.While', 'movie', 'high', 'points', 'times', 'producers', 'feel', 'necessary', 'over-establish', 'characters', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'several', 'seconds', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'reduction', 'understanding', 'impact']",Object of My Affection VHS

SPOILER:  Basically, Jennifer falls in love with Paul and this creates an ever-growing difficulty of unrequited love which puts Paul in a bind while both try to deal with the facts of life:  no matter how much a straight woman and a gay man love each other, sexual satisfaction and romantic attachments are not going to occur for most and lead to a pulling, tugging, dragging contradictory relationship that can hurt all.

Nina (Aniston) is dating a man with whom she is not truly in love.  Suddenly, she discovers she's pregnant.  One day, she meet George (Rudd) who is gay.  George moves in with Nina, and they become sudden friends.  Meanwhile, Nina offers George the fatherhood role since the real father is arrogant.  As the events fold one on one, the storyline leads this film to a surprising conclusion that will leave audiences breathless.Occassionally, the storyline can turn confusing.  However, the humor is always present.  Yet, it has a good heart.  Therefore, the events remain interesting throughout the film.  The humoristic theme combines well with the dramatic and the serious sides.  Though some of the humor is often written in other films, it remains as funny as if it was original.  As many films joke with the gay issues too much, this portrays them as regular people making a living.  There are no typical stereotypes through the characters that turn crude.Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd create the great chemistry within their lead performances that makes this film shine much more.  The humoristic side is expressed wonderfully with their actions and words.  Aniston's unique acting style creatively gives this film new dimension.

446863,A2F5OMNCGD430M,6305076731,"Diane ""dmt277""","[4, 6]","What most of you probably don't know is that this movie is ""very loosely"" based on a book by Stephen McCauley. In other words the book and the movie are very very different. I watched the movie first and liked it because I thought it was fairly original in that it was very different from any other romantic comedy I had ever seen before. It was only by complete accident that I later found out that this movie was inspired by a book. After reading the book, I went back and re-watched the movie, and thought to myself, this movie is an absolute insult to McCauley's book.The thing that I am most upset at the movie for is having Nina fall in love with George, because THIS NEVER HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. In the book Nina and George only love each other as friends and Nina never tries to seduce George like she does in the movie.There are many other huge differences between the book and the movie.  Like the fact that Paul, George's new love interest, is not an aspiring actor who lives with a critic named Rodney.  In the book, Paul lives in a small town in Vermont and is the writer of the town's newspaper. He also has a son named Gabriel, whom he adopted from a country in either South or Central America. It is not until George meets Paul and Gabriel that he agrees to help Nina raise her baby. What is really funny is that so much time has passed between the time that Nina originally asked George to help her raise the baby and the time that he accepts her proposal that by the time he tells her he wants to help her she has begun to think that her idea was not a very good one in the first place. She grudgingly accepts his offer to help her with the baby and basically tells him that she really doesn't expect this to be a permanent situation.In the movie Constance is Nina's stepsister, and in the book Constance is a somewhat mutual friend of Nina and Joley's. Nina and George do meet at Constance's party, and Joley does tell Nina that George needs a new place to live before he ever tells George that they are breaking up. However, in the movie George and Joley have been together for 4 years, and in the book they have been together for less than a year.In the movie George's brother, Frank, lives in New York and they have a pretty good relationship with each other. In fact, George is Frank's best man in his wedding. In the book, Frank lives in Boston and invites George and Nina to the wedding hoping that he can pass off Nina as George's girlfriend so that his fiancee and her conservative family will not find out that his brother is gay. When George and Nina arrive in Boston and Frank finds out that she is pregnant and cannot hide that fact he becomes very upset and demands that George and Nina make up a story that they were secretly married because of the baby. This offends George and he ends up not even attending his brother's wedding.In the movie, Vince is the father of Nina's child and is extremely resentful of her relationship with George. In the book, Howard is the name of Nina's boyfriend and she does not even meet him until after George has moved into her apartment. Howard and George become good friends and after Nina breaks up with Howard, George often remarks about how much he misses having Howard come to visit them. George also spends a good bit of the time trying to get Nina and Howard back on speaking terms with each other because he does not like it that Nina wants to exclude Howard from the raising of his child.I really don't understand why the movie producers bother to base a movie on a book when they have absolutely no intention of staying true to the book in any significant way.",3,"If You Liked this Movie, You Might Want to Read the Book",1045699200,"02 20, 2003",2003,3636,"['What', 'most', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'book', 'Stephen', 'McCauley', 'other', 'words', 'book', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'different', 'watched', 'movie', 'first', 'liked', 'thought', 'was', 'fairly', 'original', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'only', 'complete', 'accident', 'later', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'was', 'inspired', 'book', 'reading', 'book', 'went', 'back', 're-watched', 'movie', 'thought', 'myself', 'movie', 'absolute', 'insult', 'McCauley', 'book.The', 'thing', 'am', 'most', 'upset', 'movie', 'having', 'Nina', 'fall', 'love', 'George', 'THIS', 'NEVER', 'HAPPENS', 'IN', 'THE', 'BOOK', 'book', 'Nina', 'George', 'only', 'love', 'other', 'friends', 'Nina', 'never', 'seduce', 'George', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'huge', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'fact', 'Paul', 'George', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'not', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'who', 'critic', 'named', 'Rodney', 'book', 'Paul', 'small', 'town', 'Vermont', 'writer', 'town', 'newspaper', 'also', 'son', 'named', 'Gabriel', 'whom', 'adopted', 'country', 'South', 'Central', 'America', 'not', 'George', 'meets', 'Paul', 'Gabriel', 'help', 'Nina', 'raise', 'baby', 'What', 'really', 'funny', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'passed', 'time', 'Nina', 'originally', 'asked', 'George', 'help', 'raise', 'baby', 'time', 'proposal', 'time', 'help', 'begun', 'think', 'idea', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'first', 'place', 'grudgingly', 'offer', 'help', 'baby', 'basically', 'really', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'permanent', 'situation.In', 'movie', 'Constance', 'Nina', 'stepsister', 'book', 'Constance', 'somewhat', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Nina', 'Joley', 'Nina', 'George', 'do', 'meet', 'Constance', 'party', 'Joley', 'tell', 'Nina', 'George', 'new', 'place', 'live', 'ever', 'George', 'are', 'breaking', 'up', 'However', 'movie', 'George', 'Joley', 'have', 'been', 'together', '4', 'years', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'less', 'year.In', 'movie', 'George', 'brother', 'Frank', 'New', 'York', 'have', 'pretty', 'good', 'relationship', 'other', 'fact', 'George', 'Frank', 'best', 'man', 'wedding', 'book', 'Frank', 'Boston', 'George', 'Nina', 'wedding', 'hoping', 'can', 'pass', 'off', 'Nina', 'George', 'girlfriend', 'so', 'fiancee', 'conservative', 'family', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'out', 'brother', 'gay', 'When', 'George', 'Nina', 'arrive', 'Boston', 'Frank', 'out', 'pregnant', 'can', 'not', 'hide', 'fact', 'very', 'upset', 'George', 'Nina', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'were', 'secretly', 'married', 'baby', 'George', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'attending', 'brother', 'wedding.In', 'movie', 'Vince', 'father', 'Nina', 'child', 'extremely', 'resentful', 'relationship', 'George', 'book', 'Howard', 'name', 'Nina', 'boyfriend', 'not', 'even', 'meet', 'George', 'moved', 'apartment', 'Howard', 'George', 'become', 'good', 'friends', 'Nina', 'breaks', 'up', 'Howard', 'George', 'often', 'remarks', 'how', 'much', 'having', 'Howard', 'come', 'visit', 'George', 'also', 'good', 'bit', 'time', 'trying', 'get', 'Nina', 'Howard', 'back', 'speaking', 'terms', 'other', 'not', 'like', 'Nina', 'exclude', 'Howard', 'raising', 'child.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'producers', 'bother', 'base', 'movie', 'book', 'when', 'have', 'absolutely', 'intention', 'staying', 'true', 'book', 'significant', 'way']",Object of My Affection VHS

It's not political.  There's nothing outstanding about the filmmaking technique.  It's simply a pleasant diversion, and as such, I enjoy it a great deal.  And while it goes out of its way not to offend anyone, it does break some new ground in terms of mainstream Hollywood movies.The story centers around the friendship of a gay schoolteacher, George (Paul Rudd), who is dumped by his boyfriend.  (...)It's a charming movie, with terrific performances throughout.  Rudd and Anniston share terrific chemistry together.  White is appropriately sleazy.  Allison Janney and Alan Alda as Nina's sister and brother-in-law offer hilarious support.  And Nigel Hawthorne as Paul's mentor, provides the movie with heart and soul.  Pulitzer-prize winning playwright Wendy Wasserstein adapts Stephen McCauley's novel, and the script is solid.  Nicholas Hytner's direction is assured.  The movie is filled with laughs and genuine emotion.  The scene in the gym where Nina confronts Stephen packs incredible power.Some have complained that George is too perfect and too nice--that the filmmakers were so concerned about having the mainstream audience accept him as a character that they went out of his way to make him bland and inoffensive.  There might be a little truth in that, but I think Rudd's performance makes the character feel genuine at all times.  (...)However, the one thing that really pleases me about this movie is that it was the first mainstream Hollywood movie that allowed its gay character to be gay.  (I exclude ""Torch Song Trilogy"" from this analysis as TST was about gay relationships.)  Up to this point, gay characters were everybody's best friend or problem.  Window dressing to offer witty banter or to show us how liberal our heterosexual leads were.  The gay characters were only gay because we were told they were--they were never allowed to have a romance of their own.  Their love lives were always non-existent.  The fact that George not only meets another guy and dates him.

That film, &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; takes a major turn from the traditional Hollywood love story of the past.Nina, played by Jennifer Aniston (television's &quot;Friends&quot;; &quot;Office Space&quot;) and George, played by the lovable Paul Rudd (&quot;Clueless&quot;; &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot;) are roommates living in New York City. George, who recently broke up with his boyfriend played by Tim Daly (television's &quot;Wings&quot;) takes up Nina offer to room with her, but by doing so, it appears that both of them will be spending a lot of time together, almost like a couple.Nina's infatuation with George begins to grow, and although he is gay, her attraction and love for him thrives in her. As the film progresses, Nina asks George if he wants to help her raise her unborn child together as a couple, and he agrees. Yet, love steps in the way as George meets a young actor that sweeps him off his feet. Soon there is little time for Nina, and the plot continues as it explores the aftermath of Nina and George's once brief, non-sexual relationship.Director Nicholas Hytner does an excellent job in capturing Rudd and Aniston's charm onscreen. Both actors are excellent, and I must admit that Rudd's character is so adorable and cute, that it will make every straight woman want a gay friend like him in their lives. The film, which ends on a happy note, could have been a bit much more better if we got more of the outcome from George's and Nina's new romances.&quot;The Object of My Affection&quot; is one of the cutest romances to come out in years. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand what life for a single woman and gay male in the big city can be.

446886,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305076731,Matthew Horner,"[0, 0]","Is it just me, or does every Hollywood film that has a main character who is gay fall into soap opera? And why do such films seem to go out of their way to offend no one, and as a result, prove unsatisfactory to all groups?These questions plagued me while watching ""The Object of my Affection"". It's actually a rather sweet film and seems at times to be heartfelt. There are parts that are quite funny. You might say that it succeeds on a sort of 'sit com' level.This would be fine, if it's creators didn't insist on touching on some very emotional issues, all of which they back away from in one of the most implausible happy endings in recent memory.Jennifer Anniston, of the smash hit TV series ""Friends"", plays Nina, a fairly sophisticated New York girl who's in love with an obnoxious Socialist. When she meets George, played by Paul Rudd, she's offers him her spare bedroom when she learns he's just been dumped by his boyfriend of four years.Nina and George develop a close friendship. The film's makers do a good job of depicting how this relationship develops by showing scenes in different seasons. Real friendships do, after all, take some time to develop.After a while Nina finds herself pregnant by her boyfriend, who is less than pleased by this development. George, who teaches first grade in a posh private school, adores children. Nina gets dumped by the boyfriend, and George agrees to be the surrogate father.All goes along nicely until Nina falls in love with George. What seemed on paper to be a good plot device nearly derails the film. I say this for two reasons. One is that informed people no longer attempt to change someone's sexual preference. If Nina had been naive, we could see her not knowing any better. But she's too worldly to think that changing George would work. The other reason is that this takes a hip comedy and smothers it in soap opera.Another failing is that George, while not boring, is a character so perfect that he's a candidate for sainthood. I think even the most bigoted viewer would have related better to him had he been just a little raunchy.There are some memorable supporting roles, including Alan Alda, as a literary agent, and Allison Janey as his social climbing wife are hysterical. These two take name dropping to new heights.The wonderful British actor, Niger Hawthorne, plays perhaps the most true to life character. An aging critic, he has allowed a young drama student to live with him. He is wise enough to know that the age difference makes a love affair impossible.

I saw this film on TV ages ago, and it was actually edited for TV. The scene where Rodney gets punched after Paul's play wasn't in the version I saw.This film has its faults, but I love the way Paul Rudd isn't playing a stereotypical gay guy with the hands & everything. Plus, he's also (as far as I know) a straight guy, playing a gay guy, who also managed to do a full-on kiss with another guy.Object Of My Affection was a very true to life film, considering many women fall in love with gay guys, or who happen to be their best friends, and think they can 'change' them. They've never met the right women etc. All the feelings flow through in Jennifer Aniston's portrayal of Nina in this.Oh my God though, this film must have been so hard to film. Apart from the guy-on-guy kiss, Paul Rudd has admitted to him & Jennifer not getting on during the filming, and I can't remember exactly what he said, but it wasn't nice. And it shows in the movie! They seem almost like they're going through the motions with their lines. Paul also appeared in the last two series of Friends, as Phoebe's boyfriend (and then husband) Mike, but notably, never appeared in a single scene with Jennifer, only in group scenes, and they were never placed near each other. Wow.This won't appeal to many people, and could easily have been a TV movie shown during the day, or late at night. It's unoffensive, cheap & cheerful.

Excellent supporting cast includes Alan Alda (""M.A.S.H.""), Nigel Hawthorne (""Yes, Prime Minister"") and John Pankow as Vince, Nina's boyfriend and father to her unborn child.The plot - Nina wants George, rather than Vince, to be the father of her child - is a vehicle for exploring not only the different attitudes informing hetero- and homosexual love, but of those differences between men and women. Nigel Hawthorne's character Rodney, a ""gay"" theatre critic living in an unrequited relationship with a young gay actor, eloquently summarises the dilemma facing people in love, in a  genuinely heartfelt moment towards the film's end. Rodney questions Nina's resolve to have a gay man be the father of her child: ""don't fix your life so that you're left alone ...when you come to the middle of it"".The final scene then neatly, and without any hint of irony, subverts Rodney's advice by fixing Nina to be Mom to George's gay Dad.Despite the feel-good slipperiness of the ending, the film does attempt to address the notion of ""love"" beyond the borders of standard Hollywood hyperbole, and should be commended for doing so.4 1/2 stars.",4,not sex but love,1114732800,"04 29, 2005",2005,1351,"['Romantic', 'drama', 'relatively', 'light', 'touch', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'Nina', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'George', 'are', 'convincing', 'social', 'worker', 'gay', 'teacher', 'who', 'emotional', 'boundaries', 'love', 'straight', 'gay', 'Excellent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Alan', 'Alda', 'M.A.S.H', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'Yes', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'John', 'Pankow', 'Vince', 'Nina', 'boyfriend', 'father', 'unborn', 'child.The', 'plot', 'Nina', 'George', 'rather', 'Vince', 'be', 'father', 'child', 'vehicle', 'exploring', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'attitudes', 'informing', 'hetero-', 'homosexual', 'love', 'differences', 'men', 'women', 'Nigel', 'Hawthorne', 'character', 'Rodney', 'gay', 'critic', 'living', 'unrequited', 'relationship', 'young', 'gay', 'actor', 'eloquently', 'dilemma', 'facing', 'people', 'love', 'genuinely', 'heartfelt', 'moment', 'film', 'end', 'Rodney', 'questions', 'Nina', 'resolve', 'have', 'gay', 'man', 'be', 'father', 'child', 'do', ""n't"", 'fix', 'life', ""'re"", 'left', 'alone', 'when', 'come', 'middle', 'final', 'scene', 'then', 'neatly', 'hint', 'irony', 'Rodney', 'advice', 'fixing', 'Nina', 'be', 'Mom', 'George', 'gay', 'Dad.Despite', 'feel-good', 'slipperiness', 'ending', 'film', 'attempt', 'address', 'notion', 'love', 'borders', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'hyperbole', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'doing', 'so.4', '1/2', 'stars']",Object of My Affection VHS

Yet Paul Rudd and  Jennifer Aniston generate a winning chemistry, and the entire supporting  cast is uniformly superb.  What I found most compelling in this movie,  which is sprinkled with genuine humor, is the real-life dilemma young  people find themselves in when they make choices without considering the  forest through the trees.  There are real emotionally charged situations  explored here, and the fact that Rudd's character is gay is important, but  his homosexuality is not the primary concern.  I was definitely moved by  this film, though I found the ending superfluous and silly; it seemed like  a politically correct way to tie up loose strings.",4,VERY VERY GOOD,947289600,"01 8, 2000",2000,856,"['bittersweet', 'love', 'story', 'strikes', 'many', 'many', 'truthful', 'chords', 'wonderful', 'book', 'Stephen', 'McCauley', 'somewhat', 'diffused', 'grit', 'twists', 'strangely', 'PC', 'script', 'Wendy', 'Wasserstein', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Jennifer', 'Aniston', 'generate', 'winning', 'chemistry', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'What', 'found', 'most', 'compelling', 'movie', 'sprinkled', 'genuine', 'humor', 'real-life', 'dilemma', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'when', 'make', 'choices', 'considering', 'forest', 'trees', 'are', 'real', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'situations', 'explored', 'here', 'fact', 'Rudd', 'character', 'gay', 'important', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'primary', 'concern', 'was', 'definitely', 'moved', 'film', 'found', 'ending', 'superfluous', 'silly', 'seemed', 'politically', 'correct', 'way', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'strings']",Object of My Affection VHS

446905,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6305076731,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""The Object of My Affection"" explores the isssue of straight women falling in love with gay men. This topic is even more prevailent in 2009, what with ""American Idol"" and Adam Lambert in which many women are in love with him, despite the fact that he is gay. Women have always felt a strong connection to male homosexuals for we, as gay guys, can be very affectionate, articulate, sensitive, and artistic, something that straight men can sometimes lack.Jennifer Aniston, from TV's ""Friends"", stars as Nina, who is pregnant, and decides she wants to raise the child with her best friend George, who is gay and an elementary school teacher. Paul Rudd, who plays George, portrays his character in a positive manner, ignoring all the gay cliches that are sometimes prevailent in gay characterizations in films. George is straight-looking, beautiful to look at, and very much a man. He also has all the qualities that Nina's boyfriend doesn't possess, which is one of the reasons she falls in love with George, knowing  a romance between them will never come to pass. ""The Object Of My Affection"" is a beautiful love story between two adult people who love one another, a love story unlike any I have seen in film. The writing is excellent, the performances flawless as we really feel for these people, and the directing is dead on.The DVD comes with tons of bonuses, including the original trailer, a featurette, TV spots, dolby sound, and it comes with english and spanish subtitles.
