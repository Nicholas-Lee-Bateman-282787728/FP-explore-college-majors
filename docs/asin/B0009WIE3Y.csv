Co-workers and I would congregate around the water cooler to talk about the previous nights episode.  Now HBO has Period-Pieces of some historical relevance...a shame.But, everyone should enjoy this show.  Its not just about the main character.  Its about his circle of married and single friends as well.

914781,AW3VZ5O895LRK,B0009WIE3Y,"carol irvin ""carol irvin""","[2, 2]","Chicago reporter Micky is the main character in this HBO series.  He is continually envious of his colleague Joe (Jake Weber) who is a successful serial adulterer in his office.  Although most married men may think about the same things, with adultery near the top of the list, this show's characters all behave differently in whether they act on the ideas and fantasies coursing through their minds.  Like most HBO shows, this one goes the distance in covering the territory it wants to cover and doesn't need to worry about censorship, like network tv does, with sexuality being at the core of the show.  One thing this show covers extremely well is that once you become in enmeshed in lying to your spouse, how lying to everyone insinuates itself into the entirety of your life. Even if you ""get away"" with the adultery, being a continual liar day in and day out exacts its own excruciating toll. I found this show to be more of a drama than a comedy but perhaps you need to be a married man to appreciate the comedy in the series.  Be warned: This show may be painful to watch if adultery ruined your own marriage as it develops this core theme relentlessly.P.S. One amusing part to the show is seeing how primitive the computers were which we were using in 2001.",4,Acute Dissection of Adultery,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,1267,"['Chicago', 'reporter', 'Micky', 'main', 'character', 'HBO', 'series', 'continually', 'envious', 'colleague', 'Joe', 'Jake', 'Weber', 'who', 'successful', 'serial', 'adulterer', 'office', 'most', 'married', 'men', 'may', 'think', 'same', 'things', 'adultery', 'top', 'list', 'show', 'characters', 'behave', 'differently', 'act', 'ideas', 'fantasies', 'coursing', 'minds', 'most', 'HBO', 'one', 'distance', 'covering', 'territory', 'cover', ""n't"", 'need', 'worry', 'censorship', 'network', 'tv', 'sexuality', 'being', 'core', 'show', 'One', 'thing', 'show', 'extremely', 'well', 'once', 'become', 'enmeshed', 'lying', 'spouse', 'how', 'lying', 'everyone', 'entirety', 'life', 'Even', 'get', 'away', 'adultery', 'being', 'continual', 'liar', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'own', 'excruciating', 'toll', 'found', 'show', 'be', 'more', 'drama', 'comedy', 'perhaps', 'need', 'be', 'married', 'man', 'appreciate', 'comedy', 'series', 'Be', 'warned', 'show', 'may', 'be', 'painful', 'watch', 'adultery', 'ruined', 'own', 'marriage', 'core', 'theme', 'relentlessly.P.S', 'One', 'amusing', 'part', 'show', 'seeing', 'how', 'primitive', 'computers', 'were', 'were', 'using', '2001']",The Mind of the Married Man - The Complete First Season

In this case, I really didn't read enough about the plot and premise of this series, which I later found would clearly appeal more to viewers younger than myself and more attuned to a raunchy satire on sexual mores and goings-on among the well-to-do and up-and-rising urban professional class.
