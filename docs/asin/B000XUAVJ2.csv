Plus the Wrestlemanias themselves.Unfortunately most of his matches are cut up and edited, leaving only the matches against Jimmy Snuka, Jake Roberts, Giant Gonzalez, King Kong Bundy, The Big Show & A-Train, Mark Henry, and Batista shown in their entirety, uncut.While the disc claims to have interviews with all of his opponents, this is not only impossible (as Ray Traylor, the Big Boss Man, is dead) but the disc has NO interviews with any of his opponents regarding the matches.Much of the matches could also be found on other DVD releases, like WWE Tombstone and individual Wrestlemania DVD releases (from 15-23 on DVD).  This is just an attempt for the WWE to cash in on the Undertaker yet again with yet another DVD release.For 15 dollars, this is something of a good deal if you're not interested in buying the entire Wrestlemania anthology.  But if you're a fan who has to have a series as important as Wrestlemania, just stick with that.",1,Just buy the Wrestlemania Anthology...,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,1046,"['more', 'expensive', 'get', 'Undertaker', 'Wrestlemania', 'matches', 'uncut', 'once', 'Wrestlemanias', 'themselves.Unfortunately', 'most', 'matches', 'are', 'cut', 'up', 'edited', 'leaving', 'only', 'matches', 'Jimmy', 'Snuka', 'Jake', 'Roberts', 'Giant', 'Gonzalez', 'King', 'Kong', 'Bundy', 'Big', 'Show', 'A-Train', 'Mark', 'Henry', 'Batista', 'shown', 'entirety', 'disc', 'claims', 'have', 'interviews', 'opponents', 'not', 'only', 'impossible', 'Ray', 'Traylor', 'Big', 'Boss', 'Man', 'dead', 'disc', 'NO', 'interviews', 'opponents', 'regarding', 'matches.Much', 'matches', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'found', 'other', 'DVD', 'releases', 'WWE', 'Tombstone', 'individual', 'Wrestlemania', 'DVD', 'releases', '15-23', 'DVD', 'just', 'attempt', 'WWE', 'cash', 'Undertaker', 'yet', 'again', 'yet', 'DVD', 'release.For', '15', 'dollars', 'something', 'good', 'deal', ""'re"", 'not', 'interested', 'buying', 'entire', 'Wrestlemania', 'anthology', ""'re"", 'fan', 'who', 'have', 'series', 'as', 'important', 'Wrestlemania', 'just', 'stick']",WWE - Undertaker 15-0

1115128,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B000XUAVJ2,D.P.,"[1, 1]","In the spirit of WrestleMania time, I happened to found a copy of a DVD WWE put out years ago documenting ""the streak"" of the Undertaker at that current time.  As usual with the Undertaker's current character, he didn't speak on this presentation but we did see see highlights early career moments such as his debut & winning the WWE Title for the first time while the buildup to each match was talked about.  Now it should also be noted that despite this presentation talking about showing every Mania match, only a select few were shown in full while the rest were joined in progress so I only reviewed the complete matches here.vs. Jimmy Snuka - This match was pretty short with Taker showcasing his dominance with his trademark moves like the flying clothesline & tombstone.  Outside of the fact that this was Taker's Mania debut & the beginning of the streak, nothing special past his dominate victory over a legend.WrestleMania VIIvs. Jake Roberts - The former allies & now enemies met here with a different twist for Undertaker as he was now a fan favorite during going into this match.  Taker was his usual dominate self here as he completely no sold Robert's offense & took the fight to the floor throwing Jake into the ringpost before going back into the ring throwing him into the turnbuckles.  Roberts was able to somehow hit Taker with his DDT twice but make the mistake of turning his focus to Paul Bearer which not only ended up cost Roberts the match but his WWE career at that point.WrestleMania VIIIvs. Giant Gonzales - This was one of the rare times that Taker had to look up to someone & Gonzales used that to his advantage to dish out punishment in the ring & out on the floor using the steel steps only for Taker only for him to keep getting back up.  Taker was eventually able to get some momentum & take Gonzales down to one knee before he resorted to some desperate tactics to make sure in his mind Taker wouldn't get back up...only for Taker to not only return but also knock Gonzales off his feet.  This match took place during the period where WWE saw Taker as more of an attraction & kept having him feud against other ""monster"" characters who just weren't good in the ring causing Taker to have to carry the match on his own as was the case with Gonzales here.WrestleMania IXvs. King Kong Bundy - After Taker was absent for WMX, he returned here feuding with a member of Ted Dibiase's Million $ Corporation in a mission (that would pretty much describe his entire year of 1995) to retrieve back his urn that was stolen from him while it should be noted that American League Baseball umpire Larry Young was the special referee for some unknown reason.  In a nutshell, this match was once again another match where Taker pretty much had to carry the weight here as Bundy was very limited in what he could do past certain moves like his Avalanche splash in the corner however this match was the definition of the phrase ""winning the battle but not the war.""WrestleMania XIHell In A Cell vs. Big Boss Man - This was the first time that a Hell In A Cell match took place at Mania as it was during this time period that Taker had his own stable called The Ministry & declared war against Mr. McMahon & his corporation causing McMahon to send his enforcer into action.  Overall this was a slow paced brawl that saw Boss Man use his signature handcuffs & nightstick to work over Taker causing him to bleed before Taker recovered using a chair & the cell against Boss Man on his way to victory but it should be noted that the aftermath where Boss Man was hung from the top of the cell thanks to the Brood wasn't shown. This match was very disappointing quality for this type of match to the point where they never show highlights of this match when showing the history of the match & this match was excluded from the DVD anthology of Hell In A Cell.WrestleMania XVvs. Big Show & A-Train - This happened during the era of Taker going under the biker gimmick as the ""American Bad Ass"" & with his original tag partner Nathan Jones being attacked earlier in the night, Taker had a handicap match here.  Taker tried to get a quick win early here causing Show & Train to use the numbers advantage with double team power moves before Taker was able to use the strategy of divide & conquer and receive some help in order to keep the streak alive.  This was pretty much what you would expect from a handicap match here but Taker had a better performance here against these two big than than he's had in the past at Mania at times against one.WrestleMania XIXvs. Kane - Kane attacked & helped bury his brother alive at Survivor Series months earlier only for Taker to keep sending various messages to Kane for months teasing the return of Undertaker under his original persona of ""The Deadman"" but we ended up getting more than that as we also saw the return of Paul Bearer.  This match was pretty short & sweet with Kane not believing that Taker was really there before Taker not only showed him that he was back & dominated his way to victory over his brother in a way that showed that the ""Deadman"" is back.WrestleMania XX[Tombstone: History Of The Undertaker]Casket Match vs. Mark Henry - Another Mania first in that this was the first casket match at the event.  In a nutshell, Mark Henry was another limited big man so the match was a slow paced brawl as this was one of those cases where the stipulation definitely helped more than it would have been if they had a regular match.  Nothing special here past the fact that this was the first casket match at Mania.WrestleMania 22vs. World Champion Batista - Taker's Undefeated Streak vs. Batista's Title and I'll be point blank honest, this was the match that should have ended the show. This was Batista's best showing since his series against Triple H around a year earlier as he stepped up his game & didn't show any lack of effort like most of his previous performances. This was a classic ""big money"" WrestleMania match & the match of the night for me as you saw the crowd off the chain throughout the bout & even moments where it looked like Batista was going to end the streak & with various moments to look out for like Undertaker's big dive onto Batista, Batista's running powerslam through the announce table, and Batista taking it to the air with a flying shoulderblock off the top. It's ironic that this was the 20 year anniversary of WrestleMania 3 but Undertaker walks out of his WM the same way he did 10 years earlier...as a champion.[Greatest Stars Of The 21st Century]WWE decided to exclude most of the matches that we've had released on the previous Undertaker set (XII vs. Diesel, XIX vs. Kane, X-7 vs. Triple H) which I didn't mind but there were still some complete performances that have yet to be released on a separate set (13 vs. Sid for the WWE Title, X8 vs. Flair, 21 vs. Orton) that would have been better choices to see than some of the easily forgettable bad quality encounters from the early days of the streak that were put on here instead.  In the end, this is a nice set to have if you feel like you want to have some of Taker's matches from Mania without spending the price to buy the entire Mania events but past that, this is a set you can skip as most of Taker's quality Mania performances weren't showcased here or are available elsewhere.",3,"A Timeline Of ""The Streak""",1333929600,"04 9, 2012",2012,7345,"['spirit',

1115129,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000XUAVJ2,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 2]","UNDERTAKER15-01.VS ""SUPERFLY"" JIMMY SNUKA-the very first match at Mania for the Deadman and he was going against the great Jimmy Snuka. This match took place at Mania 7 which is also the event that had one of my all time favorite matches on it. The match really is a short one that sees Taker really dominate Snuka for the entire match. This really put him over at the time.2.VS JAKE ""THE SNAKE"" ROBERTS-taking place at Mania 8 [another event with one of my all time favorite matches] this would pit one time allies against each other. After Taker stopped Jake from nailing Randy Savage and Elizabeth with a chair they went at each other. So the match at Wrestlemania 8 had to happen. This was more of a competitive match then the previous year. In fact these two are very similar as far as being dark characters. I remember at the time I even wanted Jake to win, in fact I still love him even with all his problems. Jake landed his DDT various times but Taker still comes back of course with the win.3.VS GIANT GONZALEZ-Wrestlemania 9 [had one of the worst endings to a Mania ever] is the only match in which Taker wins by a DQ. The match its self is one of those stereotypical big man vs. big man matches. That is of course due to Giant's {R.I.P.} lack of ability but it did put him over for a while. That is until Taker returns to the ring and takes him out.4.VS KING KONG BUNDY-at the 11th Mania Taker would take on Million Dollar Corporation member King Kong Bundy. That group had taken the urn from him so he was on a mission to get it back. This match is all about him trying to get it back and nothing more. It is an ok match as both did what they could with each other but it was limited. Taker ends up getting the pin after his flying clothesline.5.VS DIESEL-the story here was Diesel had cost Taker the title at the Royal Rumble against Bret Hart. So they had to meet at Wrestlemania after Taker cost Diesel his chance at the title. This of course was at Mania 12. The action is back and forth as Diesel was very cocky during the match, dominating at times. But Taker of course comes back like he always does and takes Big Daddy out. This is actually a match I really enjoy and loved the build to this match6.VS ""PSYCHO"" SID-yes at the time he was just ""Psycho"" Sid, I know you know him as Justice or Vicious but at the time just Sid. This match was for the WWF title with Taker as the challenger. It was also very fitting that this was Mania 13, so it made sense for Taker to take the title here. I actually have always liked this match while others have hated on it. The only thing is I wish that they would have let him beat Sid without the interference. As the match went on the great Bret Hart would come down to the ring and nail Sid with a chair. After a little while he returned and cost Sid the match although Sid would have lost anyways. I always thought it was crazy that Bret helped Taker win the belt and then would later be the one to take it from him at SummerSlam.7.VS KANE-the first Mania fight between the brothers and one of the biggest hyped and most anticipated matches ever. This match would see Taker take some punishment form his little brother for a good back and forth battle. In the end though Taker would nail the Tombstone piledriver multiple times for the win and take his little Bro out. This match had a really good build , I remember at the time being really psyched for this match. Also this was at Mania 14, one of [if not] my favorite Mania's ever.8.VS BIG BOSS MAN-this match was a Hell in the Cell match at Mania 15 and while not the best ever it is a bit better than most give it credit for. This was a big man vs. big man match so it was a bit limited . It was mainly a brawl between the two for most of the match. I remember before this match I loved the feud going on here between The Ministry and the Corporation. Taker wins after a tombstone but it is what happened after the match most people remember.9.VS TRIPLE H-this match would take place at Mania 17 during the taker's ""American Badass"" days. This is another match that never seems to get enough credit, I personally thought it was a great match. This was a great back and forth match with some great moments and I loved Triple H's escape from the last ride. Still you all know the outcome as Taker takes the match after a hard fought battle.10.VS RIC FLAIR-taking place at Mania 18 which was a very historical one, this may have actually been my favorite match form that night. This was a great showdown between these two legends. It really was a beat down but Flair was excellent in this match. He battled back the entire time against the big man making this a very dramatic match. In the end it was not enough as Taker lands a tombstone and gets the win. Flair would have a similar match later on against the Big Show in ECW.11.VS BIG SHOW & A-TRAIN-this match was at 19 and was supposed to be a tag match with Nathan Jones as Taker's partner. But Jones was attacked before the match, which made it a handicapped match. The action is quick enough sense it does not last to long. Taker takes it to both guys as they try to over power him. Jones makes it into the match later helping Taker get the win.12.VS KANE-ah yes the rematch at the event that was supposed to help it ""all begin again"", that of course was Mania 20. This math was a bit like their first Mania match with both brawling and using power moves. The storyline going in was good as was the match but it was not as great as some of their other battles. Taker of course gets the win, this is his DVD after all.13.VS RANDY ORTON-Mania 21 was when things went Hollywood and the legend would go against the legend killer. This was a good match between the two that would even see Randy's father interfere. The pace is good and Taker of course takes the win, as if you didn't know.14.VS MARK HENRY-this was a casket match in which of course you know the purpose. This was a decent match between the two big men as they traded power shots with each other. Henry looked good at one point but went for a pin fall, mistake. Taker of course gets the win. This of course took place at Mania 22.15.VS BATISTA-Mania 23 right here good folks and I am sure you know how this one ends. This is another one that is better than most give it credit for and that may be because of other matches on the card. This is pretty good battle between the two some good big man vs. big man action.This is a good enough set but you don't need it if you have all the Wrestlemania's. Over all I would say pick it up if you have to have any and everything wrestling related like my self. Other than that you probably already own all of these matches.",4,GOOD SET,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,6695,"['UNDERTAKER15-01.VS', 'SUPERFLY', 'JIMMY', 'SNUKA-the', 'very', 'first', 'match',

1115131,ABCKTG6GQUSNU,B000XUAVJ2,Lord Kayoss,"[4, 4]","After reading the box at walmart and seeing ""interviews with past opponents"" I was expecting this to be some kind of documentary, which I am a big fan of.  There isn't one interview with anyone on this disc.  What you get instead is Taker's matches from all of his 15 Wrestlemania's (to date of the release).  A couple are full length, but most start about half way through with a narrator spitting kayfabe in between.As a long-time, avid Undertaker fan I have to say even if I didn't already have these matches in my library I still would've been disappointed with this purchase.  This is something that you would've gotten with a Coliseum Video purchase back when WWF/E was much more colorful and family-oriented.  Doesn't hold much water in today's era.Not only is the DVD misleading with it's documentary-style marketing pitch, the limited content and delivery leave quite a bit to be desired.I would never publicly tell anyone to illegally download something, but this DVD left me with the feeling that it would serve the WWE right if people pirated the h*ll out of this one (which I'm sure they are already doing).  I feel ripped off and like I wasted my money.",1,"Box Is Misleading, Buyer Beware!",1208908800,"04 23, 2008",2008,1167,"['reading', 'box', 'walmart', 'seeing', 'interviews', 'past', 'opponents', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'kind', 'documentary', 'am', 'big', 'fan', ""n't"", 'one', 'interview', 'anyone', 'disc', 'What', 'get', 'instead', 'Taker', 'matches', '15', 'Wrestlemania', 'date', 'release', 'couple', 'are', 'full', 'length', 'most', 'start', 'way', 'narrator', 'spitting', 'kayfabe', 'between.As', 'long-time', 'avid', 'Undertaker', 'fan', 'have', 'say', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'have', 'matches', 'library', 'still', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'something', 'would', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'Coliseum', 'Video', 'purchase', 'back', 'when', 'WWF/E', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'colorful', 'family-oriented', ""n't"", 'hold', 'much', 'water', 'today', 'era.Not', 'only', 'DVD', 'misleading', 'documentary-style', 'marketing', 'pitch', 'limited', 'content', 'delivery', 'leave', 'quite', 'bit', 'be', 'desired.I', 'would', 'never', 'publicly', 'tell', 'anyone', 'illegally', 'download', 'something', 'DVD', 'left', 'feeling', 'would', 'serve', 'WWE', 'right', 'people', 'pirated', 'h*ll', 'one', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'already', 'doing', 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'wasted', 'money']",WWE - Undertaker 15-0
