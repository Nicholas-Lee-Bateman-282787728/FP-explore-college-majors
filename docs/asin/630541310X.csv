It is an understated, yet excellently crafted love story.Tim Melville has the innocence and desire to love of Forrest Gump, but is not the cartoon of a character as Tom Hanks portrayed. He lives with his soon-to-be-married sister and parents in a small, working class home.Like in 1981's ""Gallipoli,"" Gibson is a young Australian, complete with an accent. Here, he is a slow, but gentle laborer who does yard work for Mary, an older woman, played by Piper Laurie.Slowly, they discover that although 20+ years separate them, they are falling love. His parents and sister protect him and want the best for him. They show mixed feelings about the relationship that Tim and Mary do not realize exists.This is a romance, but it is also about the love of Tim's father for his son, and of the process of life. It is sad; expect tears to be shed.We see Gibson in a role that highlights the working man, the need to respect and care for the mentally challenged, and the show the many layers of love in a family.It is unrated, but probably deserves a PG rating. There's no profanity, violence or adult scenes. The audio is decent, but the video quality is lacking. The age of the original film shows some deterioration.

He is so nice and honest and good tempered it is almost impossible to suspend belief that he is a real person. His parents (beautifully played by Alwyn Kurts and Pat Evsion, each AFI winners) and sister, well played by Deborah Kennedy, are well-drawn flawed individuals whereas the good looking Tim comes across like a Ken Doll Stepford Husband. That is possbly why Piper Laurie falls for him and marries him.

462991,A2VP31U48VZUOZ,630541310X,"E. Marin ""voracious reader""","[2, 2]","This movie loses some of the power of Colleen McCullough's novel by glossing over the lonely lives of the main characters prior to their relationship.  It is by seeing Tim Melville, a bewildered child who longs to get in on the jokes at his expense,  get mocked and kicked around by his workmates, and Mary Horton playing the prickly, aloof dragon lady at her office and taking solitary comfort in her carefully arranged life and material possessions, that we appreciate what a transformation each undergoes in the course of the story.  Also, the actors cast do not match the physical appearances described in the novel (a matter on which I usually am not picky, but which does have some impact on the plotline in this case).  Finally, the perky background music can be somewhat obnoxious and occasionally masks the dialogue in my copy.All of those complaints aside, this is an endearing, moving, and uplifting film with very good acting.  Mel Gibson is excellent, projecting the essential sweetness, enthusiasm, and yearning of his character with his expressive eyes and irresistable grin in the necessary absence of eloquent dialogue.  Piper Laurie could have been allowed to stretch a bit, to show the crotchety spinster she believed herself to be before getting to know Tim, but she is attractive, sympathetic and believable.  The actors who played Tim's parents were particularly good.  One could even argue that the choice to focus more on the dynamics of Mary and the family so dear to Tim allowed a more satisfying conclusion than that of the novel.

The plot is worthy of the Lifetime channel but Laurie and Gibson are great and the supporting cast which includes respected Australian actors Alwyn Kurts and Pat Evison transcends the simplistic and slightly pervey script.This Australian film was made so quickly and cheaply, I don't believe they even did second takes. Happily, the 30th anniversary edition has been remastered so it is a clear and watchable print and re-edited to include a couple of deleted scenes.Of course, young Gibson's gorgeous blue eyes, cute accent and his character's charming innocence are so very appealing that the script actually seems plausible. Mel's physical attributes are happily highlighted by his short shorts work outfit and by the blue Speedo style trunks he wears to the beach. Gibson looks quite angelic in the white dress suit he is wearing in one pivotal scene.

In this love story, Tim is working odd jobs, living with his parents and older sister, and jumping with hormones and bulging with muscles.  He's a looker alright, and many women notice him, but then they find out that he's a ""few bob short of a quid"", while his mates tease him mercilessly.Piper Laurie plays a business woman living alone who needs yard help.  She's smart, independent and doing great for 1979.  Only one thing:  no man in her life, none can please her, until puppy-like Time, half her age, appears with a rake at the door, and follows her every word.  Now how's that for a man, and a gorgeous hunk to boot?What's interesting in this story - both book and film are well-done - is the deliberate set up done by Colleen McCullough, later known for the bestseller, ""The Thorn Birds"".  She was an Australian biologist who got as far as working in research at Harvard in the 1960's.  As a female, she got just over half of what the male researchers were earning, based on the fact that ""they're men"".  She was furious about it, and champed at the bit, but couldn't afford to quit.  So she started writing this first book, purposefully creating a story of impossible tension where the love affair simply cannot  - well, almost - cannot be consummated, much as all the readers are rooting for it.  The book sold 50,000 copies and brought her enough money to quit the ripoff research job.Inspired by this sucess, she turned on the same formula to create the Thornbirds plot, where a Catholic priest is in love with a girl, who later as a woman does bed him, well, much later, but that provides many pages of tension for the reader.McCullough remains an excellent researcher in all her novels, and of course, you may know that THe Thornbirds became a film.In this regard, I recommend TIM, because it is an engaging film, it shows Australia in the late 1970's (feminist days), and it is all a very deliberate wink at women's yearning for impossible matches.Mel Gibson was just beginning to enter some years of debauchery, full of drinking and promiscuity, which he now fully admits.  In fact, when interviewed about his controversial film, THE PASSION, he freely states that his 20's were a crazy time, for which  he now feels himself in an unremitting contrition. That is why he became interested in reviving the old traditions of the Catholic Church, full of judgment, recrimination and punishment, chastising sin heavily but promising redemption.  IN this film, you can see him BEFORE he ruins his youthful body and face with the devil's business.Ach, Mel, what a devil you are.  And handsome, too!

And so, I could not resist this purchase, especially given the low price of the DVD.Well, Mel Gibson is still hot (in the movie; in real life, not so much); Piper Laurie - piping HOT! (who knew!? that woman had some body on her!); the story - as sugar sweet as I remembered it...The story must have been trully revolutionary by the 1970's standards: a mentally slow man in his 20's and an educated and independent woman in her 40's fall in love. Though its telling is a bit stiff and naive, the questions the tale raises are relevant to any modern couple (mainly: can a relationship work, when the control is so steeply tipped toward the female?). Since I am not aware of many of such parings in real life, I am sure this love story may still make some uncomfortable. Nonetheless, I enjoy it for the uplifting moral which teaches us that love conquers all and is above the judgement of those outside of the two people involved.
