I did like learning about the origins of the Knights Templar (Knights of King Solomon's Temple), and about their military and political influence, as well as their demise, but there are more things that put me off.For one thing, the battle scenes they showed could have been pulled off by my kids...in fact I've seen more intense battles first-hand than the ones depicted in this show.  For another thing, the historians they showed looked painfully like historians...all academics, no fun, and they seemed to be more interested in sharing what they thought than what they knew.Of course, part of the attraction of a documentary like this is that there is so much suspected and so little actually known about the fate of the Knights Templar.  This is painfully obvious from recent pop-culture, e.g., the movieNational Treasure (Widescreen Edition), and who knows how many action-adventure novels tie in?Anyway,I thought that there was WAY too much conjecture and arm-waving about what might have happened, and too little attention paid to showing what we KNOW happened.So, all in all, I have to say that I didn't like this show, even though I really wanted to.2 stars...sigh",2,What a snoozer!,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,1379,"['wanted', 'watch', 'documentary', 'wanted', 'like', 'documentary', 'paraphrase', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'OK', 'like', 'documentaries', 'general', 'was', 'intruiged', 'one', 'did', 'learning', 'origins', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'Knights', 'King', 'Solomon', 'Temple', 'military', 'political', 'influence', 'as', 'well', 'demise', 'are', 'more', 'things', 'put', 'one', 'thing', 'battle', 'showed', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pulled', 'off', 'kids', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'intense', 'first-hand', 'ones', 'depicted', 'show', 'thing', 'historians', 'showed', 'looked', 'painfully', 'like', 'historians', 'academics', 'fun', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'sharing', 'what', 'thought', 'what', 'knew.Of', 'course', 'part', 'attraction', 'documentary', 'so', 'much', 'suspected', 'so', 'little', 'actually', 'known', 'fate', 'Knights', 'Templar', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'recent', 'pop-culture', 'e.g.', 'movieNational', 'Treasure', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'who', 'how', 'many', 'action-adventure', 'novels', 'tie', 'Anyway', 'thought', 'was', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'conjecture', 'arm-waving', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'happened', 'too', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'showing', 'what', 'KNOW', 'happened.So', 'have', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'even', 'really', 'wanted', 'to.2', 'stars', 'sigh']",In Search of History: The Knights Templar
941378,A3UT4044358ZEX,B000BF0CNE,"B. Stewart ""Debussy & Sibelius Freak""","[2, 2]","This is a very well done documentary about the Knights Templar. If you are new to this subject and looking for a broad overview of the history of the Knights in a short period of time, this is an excellent video to watch. It contains all of the key information regarding the creation, growth and downfall of the order as well as some interesting theories about what it was that the templars found in the Temple of Solomon.If you are a devoted student of the Knights Templar, you will find nothing new on this video. I have been studying the Templars for about a year and have already learned everything that was on this video. It is interesting to watch because I love the subject, but there was nothing new; no new theories, no new findings, no new scholars, no new stories, legends or myths.So, if you are looking for a starting point for your exploration of the Knights Templar, this is the place to start. If you are looking to expand an already acquired knowledge of the Templars, you probably should look somewhere else.A 3.5 but I'll bump it to 4 because of the repectful treatment of history.THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING ASThe Knights Templar(just a different cover box and title), SO DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THAT IF YOU GET THIS.",4,Good for novices.

941381,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B000BF0CNE,Israel Drazin,"[1, 1]","While this film contains nothing new, it is a good introduction for people who know little about this subject to the horrors of the Crusades generally and the Templars specifically. The term Crusades is based on the word cross, the symbol of Christianity. In 1195, the Catholic Church, as today, was divided into the Eastern and Western Church. At that time the Arabs were trying to defeat the Eastern Church and take control of the area. The Eastern Church asked Pope Urban II for help. The Pope responded by requesting some knights to go east and help defend Constantinople. He didn't realize that his request would get out of hand and result in the brutal murder of many people over the next couple of centuries.One of the reults was the creation of the Knights Templars, a group that was allegedly organized as a monastic group with military training who were dedicated to protecting pilgrims in the Holy Land. The Templars were ultimately defeated by the Muslims under the leadership of Saladin. In 1291, they abandoned the Holy Land and moved to France.Templars allegedly sought to make enormous money from the Crusades. They apparently sold alleged relics, such as parts of the wood from the cross upon which Jesus was crucified. They built castles all over Europe. They asked Christians for money promising a space in the World to Come for donations. They didn't have to pay taxes and are said to have become as rich as the Roman Catholic Church. In 1307, French King Philip IV wanted to be the most Christian king of Europe, but he was broke. He decided to take the Templar's money. So on a Friday the thirteenth, he arrested the Templars and charged them with heresy. He said they worshipped a cat. He charged the head of the Templars with 104 charges and tortured him until he confessed. Philip was unable to find the Templar's money.The film explores what the Templars did. Scholars debate still today about the Templars: were they good or bad, where are they, are they living in secret, and where is their wealth.",3,Brief history of the Knights Templars,1352592000,"11 11, 2012",2012,2026,"['film', 'nothing', 'new', 'good', 'introduction', 'people', 'who', 'know', 'little', 'subject', 'horrors', 'Crusades', 'generally', 'Templars', 'specifically', 'term', 'Crusades', 'based', 'word', 'cross', 'symbol', 'Christianity', '1195', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'today', 'was', 'divided', 'Eastern', 'Western', 'Church', 'time', 'Arabs', 'were', 'trying', 'defeat', 'Eastern', 'Church', 'take', 'control', 'area', 'Eastern', 'Church', 'asked', 'Pope', 'Urban', 'II', 'help', 'Pope', 'responded', 'requesting', 'knights', 'go', 'east', 'help', 'defend', 'Constantinople', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'request', 'would', 'get', 'hand', 'result', 'brutal', 'murder', 'many', 'people', 'next', 'couple', 'centuries.One', 'reults', 'was', 'creation', 'Knights', 'Templars', 'group', 'was', 'allegedly', 'organized', 'monastic', 'group', 'military', 'training', 'who', 'were', 'dedicated', 'protecting', 'pilgrims', 'Holy', 'Land', 'Templars', 'were', 'ultimately', 'defeated', 'Muslims', 'leadership', 'Saladin', '1291', 'abandoned', 'Holy', 'Land', 'moved', 'France.Templars', 'allegedly', 'sought', 'make', 'enormous', 'money', 'Crusades', 'apparently', 'sold', 'alleged', 'relics', 'such', 'parts', 'wood', 'cross', 'Jesus', 'was', 'crucified', 'built', 'castles', 'Europe', 'asked', 'Christians', 'money', 'promising', 'space', 'World', 'Come', 'donations', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'taxes', 'are', 'said', 'have', 'become', 'as', 'rich', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', '1307', 'French', 'King', 'Philip', 'IV', 'wanted', 'be', 'most', 'Christian', 'king', 'Europe', 'was', 'broke', 'decided', 'take', 'Templar', 'money', 'So', 'Friday', 'thirteenth', 'arrested', 'Templars', 'charged', 'heresy', 'said', 'worshipped', 'cat', 'charged', 'head', 'Templars', '104', 'charges', 'tortured', 'confessed', 'Philip', 'was', 'unable', 'find', 'Templar', 'money.The', 'film', 'what', 'Templars', 'did', 'Scholars', 'debate', 'still', 'today', 'Templars', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'where', 'are', 'are', 'living', 'secret', 'where', 'wealth']",In Search of History: The Knights Templar
