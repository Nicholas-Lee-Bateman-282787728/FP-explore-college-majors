I would have appreciated seeing the people's names on the screens each time they spoke throughout the documentary (noting the relationships to the other people would have been helpful, too). It is also interesting that there was very little mention of the theology of the missionaries or exactly what they attributed the change in the Auca Indians to. It seems strange to make a documentary about martyred missionaries and not talk more about their mission! There is more time spent interviewing anthropologists than ministers or theologians. I think that if the filmmakers would have slowed the pace of the narrative down and not tried to include as much as they did they could have made a harder hitting documentary that better addressed the question of why? instead of who? what? where? and when?",3,An Interesting Story But A Bit Hard To Follow At Times,1139184000,"02 6, 2006",2006,917,"['Gates', 'Splendor', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'was', 'confusing', 'times', 'due', 'number', 'people', 'interviewed', 'would', 'have', 'appreciated', 'seeing', 'people', 'names', 'screens', 'time', 'spoke', 'documentary', 'noting', 'relationships', 'other', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'helpful', 'too', 'also', 'interesting', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'mention', 'theology', 'missionaries', 'exactly', 'what', 'attributed', 'change', 'Auca', 'Indians', 'strange', 'make', 'documentary', 'martyred', 'missionaries', 'not', 'talk', 'more', 'mission', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'interviewing', 'anthropologists', 'ministers', 'theologians', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'have', 'slowed', 'pace', 'narrative', 'down', 'not', 'tried', 'include', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'harder', 'hitting', 'documentary', 'better', 'addressed', 'question', 'why', 'instead', 'who', 'what', 'where', 'when']",Beyond The Gates Of Splendor
916426,A3BEF4IHWI0VC,B0009XT8A6,Chris Luallen,"[47, 48]","""Beyond the Gates Of Splendor"" is the incredible story of five missionary families who go to Ecuador in the 1950's. Their mission suffers a tremendous tragedy when four of the men decide to attempt to make contact with the Waodani tribe, a culture considered to be among the most violent in the world according to anthropologists. Three Waodanis come out to meet the men and the two groups interact with pleasure and curiousity. But when two of the tribal members, lovers whose relationship is opposed by the tribe, return they make up a story about being attacked by the ""foreigners"" in order to explain why they had gone off without their escort. The tribe then proceeds to attack and kill the four missionaries waiting by the river. Of course, their families are shattered by this tragedy. But, later on, two of the female missionaries return to Ecuador along with their children. They eventually befriend several of the Waodani women who had left the jungle and finally ended up going back to live with the Waodanis in their rainforest home for several years.By the way, I am an atheist who feels that some missionary work can, in fact, have a largely negative impact on the indigenous peoples they are trying to convert. But even I was moved by the the sense of dedication and forgiveness shown by these women when they went to live with the same Waodanis who had murdered their husbands. But, even more so, I was interested in this movie from an anthropological point of view. It was fascinating to hear the comments of the anthropologists who had gone from working with one of the world's most peaceful tribes in Malaysia to now studying one of the most violent in the Waodanis. It also showed how much all human beings ultimately have in common, as the Waodanis interviewed were generally shown to be intelligent, sensitive people who had formed close friendships with the missionaries and their children despite the fact that the two cultures were so extremely different. It was also inspiring to see how, within a generation, the Waodanis had changed from being an extraordinarily violent society, based on blood feuds and vendettas, to an apparently peaceful one. They were even learning to use advanced technology, including one guy who had learned to fly and repair a small airpane which he used to transport his fellow Waodanis to a town with a hospital. I especially liked when the film showed the Waodanis watching old footage from World War II. The Waodanis considered the bomber pilots to be the worst type of ""savages"" because they were killing people that they didn't even know. In other words, don't get too self-righteous about our ""advanced civilization"" because even one of the world's most violent tribes is appalled by the methods of modern warfare.Beyond the incredible story, this is also a well made and beautifully shot documentary which kept me intensely absorded the entire time. My wife, a latina who grew up in Ecuador, was also captived. She said, during her childhood, the Waodanis had a reputation among all Ecuadorians as an especially violent and aggressive people. In fact, one of her sisters, who was considered to have a bad temper, was nicknamed ""Auca"" (another name for the Waodanis) and the family would make fun of her by imitating Waodani dances when she would get mad. They even had a fake spear made up for her as a joke.I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially those interested in indigenous societies and the vast potentialites of human nature and human culture.",5,Outstanding Documentary About A Group Of Missionaries And The Indigenous Tribe They Encountered,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,3527,"['Gates', 'Splendor', 'incredible', 'story', 'five', 'missionary', 'families', 'who', 'go', 'Ecuador', '1950', 'mission', 'tremendous', 'tragedy', 'when', 'four', 'men', 'decide', 'attempt', 'make', 'contact', 'Waodani', 'tribe', 'culture', 'considered', 'be', 'most', 'violent', 'world', 'according', 'anthropologists', 'Three', 'Waodanis', 'come', 'out', 'meet', 'men', 'two', 'groups', 'interact', 'pleasure', 'curiousity', 'when', 'two', 'tribal', 'members', 'lovers', 'relationship', 'opposed', 'tribe', 'return', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'being', 'attacked', 'foreigners', 'order', 'explain', 'why', 'had', 'gone', 'off', 'escort', 'tribe', 'then', 'attack', 'kill', 'four', 'missionaries', 'waiting', 'river', 'course', 'families', 'are', 'shattered', 'tragedy', 'later', 'two', 'female', 'missionaries', 'return', 'Ecuador', 'children', 'eventually', 'befriend', 'several', 'Waodani', 'women', 'who', 'had', 'left', 'jungle', 'finally', 'ended', 'up', 'going', 'back', 'live', 'Waodanis', 'rainforest', 'home', 'several', 'years.By', 'way', 'am', 'atheist', 'who', 'missionary', 'work', 'can', 'fact', 'have', 'largely', 'negative', 'impact', 'indigenous', 'peoples', 'are', 'trying', 'convert', 'even', 'was', 'moved', 'sense', 'dedication', 'forgiveness', 'shown', 'women', 'when', 'went', 'live', 'same', 'Waodanis', 'who', 'had', 'murdered', 'husbands', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'movie', 'anthropological', 'point', 'view', 'was', 'fascinating', 'hear', 'comments', 'anthropologists', 'who', 'had', 'gone', 'working', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'peaceful', 'tribes', 'Malaysia', 'now', 'studying', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'Waodanis', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'much', 'human', 'beings', 'ultimately', 'have', 'common', 'Waodanis', 'interviewed', 'were', 'generally', 'shown', 'be', 'intelligent', 'sensitive', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'formed', 'close', 'friendships', 'missionaries', 'children', 'fact', 'two', 'cultures', 'were', 'so', 'extremely', 'different', 'was', 'also', 'inspiring', 'see', 'how', 'generation', 'Waodanis', 'had', 'changed', 'being', 'extraordinarily', 'violent', 'society', 'based', 'blood', 'feuds', 'vendettas', 'apparently', 'peaceful', 'one', 'were', 'even', 'learning', 'use', 'advanced', 'technology', 'including', 'one', 'guy', 'who', 'had', 'learned', 'fly', 'repair', 'small', 'airpane', 'used', 'transport', 'fellow', 'Waodanis', 'town', 'hospital', 'especially', 'liked', 'when', 'film', 'showed', 'Waodanis', 'watching', 'old', 'footage', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Waodanis', 'considered', 'bomber', 'pilots', 'be', 'worst', 'type', 'savages', 'were', 'killing', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'other', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'self-righteous', 'advanced', 'civilization', 'even', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'violent', 'tribes', 'appalled', 'methods', 'modern', 'warfare.Beyond', 'incredible', 'story', 'also', 'well', 'made', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'documentary', 'kept', 'intensely', 'absorded', 'entire', 'time', 'My', 'wife', 'latina', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Ecuador', 'was', 'also', 'captived', 'said', 'childhood', 'Waodanis', 'had', 'reputation', 'Ecuadorians', 'especially', 'violent', 'aggressive', 'people', 'fact', 'one', 'sisters', 'who', 'was', 'considered', 'have', 'bad', 'temper', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Auca', 'name', 'Waodanis', 'family', 'would', 'make', 'fun', 'imitating', 'Waodani', 'dances', 'when', 'would', 'get', 'mad', 'even', 'had', 'fake', 'spear', 'made', 'up', 'joke.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'especially', 'interested', 'indigenous', 'societies', 'vast', 'potentialites', 'human', 'nature', 'human', 'culture']",Beyond The Gates Of Splendor

916431,A3R906AZJ9VANS,B0009XT8A6,John Black,"[0, 0]","This documentary starts off a little slow as the background is set. The background of the missionaries starts a little further back than is necessary for the story but I would have preferred a little more about the everyday life of the Waodani, before and after the missionaries made contact.However the story is about the change of the natives from a very violent people to a peaceful people, and how the missionaries' widows and eventually the missionaries' children became the true missionaries to the Waodani after the Waodani had killed the men who first made peaceful contact with them. It is an amazing story of both the Waodani's acceptance of a new way of life and of the ability of the missionaries' widows to forgive and still help the people who killed their husbands for no reason. (Or actually for a lie, this is discussed in length in the film.) The further the story goes the more interesting it was to me. Near the end of the film I really enjoyed hearing the way the older Waodani man described the Untied States after he returned from a visit.The film combines current interviews with the survivors of the missionary families and interviews with natives (both of the Waodani tribe and others from nearby tribes) with actual video footage and still photographs of the early days of contact with the Waodani. There is a moderate amount of tribal nudity in the old footage since the native wore only a very small loin cloth which covered only the genitals. All of the native woman in the early videos and photographs were topless, and neither the males nor females had any cover of they backsides. Also all of the native children ran around totally nude which continued with the younger ones after the adults and older children started wearing western clothing. One of the missionary girls is also seen nude playing with the native children at times.If you liked ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" (1991 staring Tom Berenger, John Lithgow and Daryl Hannah) and ""The Mission"" (1986 staring Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons) you will probably also like this film.

How pathetic that this ""Reluctant Cheesehead"" individual is so brainwashed by ""leftwing politics""... He/She called Beyond the Gates of Splendor ""Fundamentalist Christian Propaganda"" and actually believes these missionaries were sent to Ecuador to pave the way for oil companies...who is he kidding?BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR is hands down one of the most incredible stories that a ""heartfelt"" Christian will ever see or hear. How do I know? Because I screened Beyond the Gates with hundreds of Christians and many told me so. Beyond the Gates of Splendor is one of the most powerful and enlightning examples how God will reveal his ""GLORY"" even through such an unbelievable human tragedy as the death of 4 missionaries. I would not expect an non-Chrisitan to appreciate the full magnitude of the events in Beyond the Gates of Splendor or the sacrifice of these missionaries. As for the real Christians I can gaurantee that the story of these missionaries at some point will leave you teary eyed or questioning the depth of your own humility. The sacrifice of these missionaries and what transpired is just absolutely unbelievable. Need a lesson in forgiveness? You'll get a good lesson after watching Beyond the Gates.As to testify how America's Christian ideals have changed in the nearly 50 years since these missionaries dissappeared - when news of their disappearence made headlines hundreds of citizens went down to Ecuador to help locate them. As soon as it was discovered they were murdered the U.S. military was sent down to Ecuador to capture their murderers. The plight of the missionaries was even addressed by the President (Eisenhower) at the time and the story was a major headline here in America for weeks if not months...front page news. Today a story like this would rarely get acknowledged in the media moreless such an outpouring of so many willing to go to the aid of 4 Christians' lost in a battefield halfway around the world. Beyond the Gates of Splendor will be the most inspiring stories that a Christian will see or hear in their life. As for those who are part of the leftist new age anti-Chritian movement I doubt that they would get much at all from this documentary...

I know the historical account of the missionaries who went to Ecuador to reach out to the Waodani.  This documentary gave a very, very secular account of what happened.Gone from the documentary are any mentions of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (how can you have this possible in a documentary  about how the Lord changed the lives of an entire tribe?).  There is a tremendous gaping hole in what were the motivations of Nate Saint, Jim Elliot, and the other missionaries in going to Ecuador.  There is absolutely nothing about their love for the Lord Jesus Christ and their desire to spread the gospel to an unreached people.The gospel is not even mentioned through the documentary.  At one point, the anthropologist interviewed mentions that the Waodani changed from their warring lifestyle because they were given 'new information' from the missionaries.  What was this 'new information?'

I was unable to make sense of it, and feel that I probably should have read the book first.  This film was poorly edited; it could have benefited from a more detailed narration.  I would recommend this for someone who is already intimately familiar with the story and the various parties involved.  It's as if the filmmakers are egocentric and believe that the viewer already knows what they know, hence, no explanation is necessary.As far as the actual story goes, it was pretty much a complete turn-off to me.  The interviewees were scarily upbeat, which I thought was inappropriate in light of the horrible events being described.  Some of them reminded me of creepy cult members, who are in denial and out of touch with reality.  The only person who came across as being honestly authentic was Frank Drown, the man who found the bodies of the murdered men, who choked up on camera.  The other Americans, some of them surviving family members of the murdered men, seemed way too cheerful.It was hard for me to understand the indigenous peoples--murder is a way of life for them, so apparently slaughtering people is no big deal.  Obviously they have different values from Americans, but it was unnerving, listening to them relate stories about their own tribesmen being murdered and chopped up, then grinning about it.  I don't understand what is amusing about this.  Perhaps the filmmakers could have spent more time helping the viewer to get to know these people and their values, because frankly, they came across as psychopathic.I would like to know more about this story; however, apparently the only book on the subject was written by the widow of one of the murdered men.  After seeing the odd and unnerving behavior of the survivors, I have no desire to read this book.

Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[1, 1]","First, I need to say that this documentary does not seem so much non-fiction at all -- it flows like a terrific novel. Here's the story in a nutshell:Several Christian missionary families travel to Ecuador in the 1950s where the menfolk decide to secretly make contact with a dangerous and murderous indigenous culture. They go about it pretty shrewdly, first offering presents down a rope from the safety of an airplane. They could hardly know that *spearing* one another to death was a cultural mindset of these natives.Eventually, the men land their small airplane on a river sandbar and make some friends -- but there were internal tensions within the group at that particular time which resulted in all five men being killed. A search was conducted as Americans, having read about the episode in the news, held their collective breath. But the ultimate report was, of course, the worst sort of news.However, the endearing facet of the story evolved as the *wives* and children of these five brave men followed up by making further contact with the tribe members and actually become a part of their family! It's really an astonishing story and the entire tale is incredibly well-told.I'm not a big fan of either jungle missionary work (which I have always viewed as interference with indigenous cultures) or of documentary films because they are typically so stiff. But this episode in Ecuador (and American) history somehow seems different.

At the same time, the tribe is killing each other off at an alarming rate because of unchecked anger and a lawless culture that settles its differences at the end of a spear. Into this primitive society come five young missionary men determined to convert the people to Christianity. It's the ultimate test of courage and faith. Even though it seems they are making progress in their contact with the people, in 1956 they are speared to death as the result of a tribal feud. The men have guns, but refuse to use them, reasoning that they were prepared for Heaven but the Waodanis were not.Now the wives of the slain men must decide what to do. Two of them - Elisabet, wife of Jim Elliot, and Rachel, wife of Nate Saint - determine to pick up where their husbands left off, believing the tribe will treat women differently. They contact two women who have fled the tribe, and with their help move their children and belongings into one of the villages. There they teach them the Bible - God's carvings - and eventually befriend the very men who killed their husbands. The people repent of their life of unchecked killing and decide to follow Christ, causing their homicide rate to drop 90%. One of the tribesmen - the one who led the 1956 attack on the five missionary men - becomes a grandfather figure to one of the missionary children, whom he helps raise; and one of the missionary daughters, when she is baptized, insists on having the ceremony take place in the river where her father was killed and between two of the men who killed him.This is an endearing documentary of the power of forgiveness and how the love of Christ can transform a people. Director Jim Hanon, who also wrote the screenplay, did a superb job marrying still shots, actual home movies from the time, vintage film clips, new footage and dramatizations into a coherent whole. He based his script on the best-selling book, Through the Gates of Splendor, by Elisabet Elliot. One may ask the question, ""Why did those men have to die?"" But I believe the film shows that they were the seeds that brought forth the harvest of an entire people, and gave witness to the world that there is something more precious than one's own life. Their story will appear again as a feature film in January, 2006 called End of the Spear.Just a note: I got to hear composer Ron Owen - who wrote the music for this film, as well as that of End of the Spear - speak at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival this year, and to speak with him briefly. He is a self-effacing man with a heart for God and outstanding musical ability. The score for End of the Spear is wonderful, as I believe the film will be. I love the hearts of those five men and their families, who sacrificed everything for a people they didn't even know; as well as the hearts of these filmmakers. Please pray for them, and that God will raise up others like them.Waitsel Smith",5,PROFOUND LOOK AT LOVE AND FORGIVENESS IN THE JUNGLES OF ECUADOR,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,3121,"['end', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'oil', 'hungry', 'companies', 'try', 'move', 'jungles', 'Ecuador', 'one', 'isolated', 'tribe', 'Waodani', 'hold', 'bay', 'only', 'spears', 'many', 'lives', 'are', 'lost', 'sides', 'same', 'time', 'tribe', 'killing', 'other', 'off', 'alarming', 'rate', 'unchecked', 'anger', 'lawless', 'culture', 'differences', 'end', 'spear', 'primitive', 'society', 'come', 'five', 'young', 'missionary', 'men', 'determined', 'convert', 'people', 'Christianity', 'ultimate', 'test', 'courage', 'faith', 'Even', 'are', 'making', 'progress', 'contact', 'people', '1956', 'are', 'speared', 'death', 'result', 'tribal', 'feud', 'men', 'have', 'guns', 'refuse', 'use', 'reasoning', 'were', 'prepared', 'Heaven', 'Waodanis', 'were', 'not.Now', 'wives', 'slain', 'men', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'Two', 'Elisabet', 'wife', 'Jim', 'Elliot', 'Rachel', 'wife', 'Nate', 'Saint', 'determine', 'pick', 'up', 'where', 'husbands', 'left', 'off', 'believing', 'tribe', 'will', 'treat', 'women', 'differently', 'contact', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'fled', 'tribe', 'help', 'move', 'children', 'belongings', 'one', 'villages', 'teach', 'Bible', 'God', 'carvings', 'eventually', 'befriend', 'very', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'husbands', 'people', 'repent', 'life', 'unchecked', 'killing', 'decide', 'follow', 'Christ', 'causing', 'homicide', 'rate', 'drop', '90', '%', 'One', 'tribesmen', 'one', 'who', 'led', '1956', 'attack', 'five', 'missionary', 'men', 'grandfather', 'figure', 'one', 'missionary', 'children', 'whom', 'raise', 'one', 'missionary', 'daughters', 'when', 'baptized', 'having', 'ceremony', 'take', 'place', 'river', 'where', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'killed', 'him.This', 'endearing', 'documentary', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'how', 'love', 'Christ', 'can', 'transform', 'people', 'Director', 'Jim', 'Hanon', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'marrying', 'still', 'shots', 'actual', 'home', 'movies', 'time', 'vintage', 'film', 'clips', 'new', 'footage', 'dramatizations', 'coherent', 'whole', 'based', 'script', 'best-selling', 'book', 'Gates', 'Splendor', 'Elisabet', 'Elliot', 'One', 'may', 'ask', 'question', 'Why', 'did', 'men', 'have', 'die', 'believe', 'film', 'were', 'seeds', 'brought', 'forth', 'harvest', 'entire', 'people', 'gave', 'witness', 'world', 'something', 'more', 'precious', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'story', 'will', 'appear', 'again', 'feature', 'film', 'January', '2006', 'called', 'End', 'Spear.Just', 'note', 'got', 'hear', 'composer', 'Ron', 'Owen', 'who', 'wrote', 'music', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'End', 'Spear', 'speak', 'San', 'Antonio', 'Independent', 'Christian', 'Film', 'Festival', 'year', 'speak', 'briefly', 'self-effacing', 'man', 'heart', 'God', 'outstanding', 'musical', 'ability', 'score', 'End', 'Spear', 'wonderful', 'believe', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'love', 'hearts', 'five', 'men', 'families', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'everything', 'people', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'hearts', 'filmmakers', 'Please', 'pray', 'God', 'will', 'raise', 'up', 'others', 'them.Waitsel', 'Smith']",Beyond The Gates Of Splendor
