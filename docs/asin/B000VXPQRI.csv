I had seen him in ""The King and the Clown"" and felt compelled to watch everything he was in. Not only does he BRING IT in this drama, but the drama itself doesn't have a predictability factor that I've found in some other dramas. I was glued to my seat during every episode, and all of the actors really made me either hate or love them!

Lou""","[11, 11]","The Time Between Dog and Wolf is the twilight hour when it becomes difficult to distinguish between good and evil, or friend from foe.This series is a wise guy spy thriller of the first order. The script is tight and fast paced, the acting superb, and the photography is most excellent. Actor Lee Joon Ki's (Le Grand Chef, Sweet Spy) portrayal of the conflicted NIS (National Intelligence Service) agent Suhyun/Kay, a spy who finds himself accepted as a son by his gangland Triad boss is one to be remembered. This show is well populated with a host of very memorable and well developed characters. On location filming in Thailand and Korea adds considerably to the gritty underworld reality of the film. Directed by Jin Min Kim. The very good English subtitle work by David Bannon makes this film very watchable for the non Korean speaking viewer. This series is so good that I unreservedly recommended it most highly.

Bannon ""The Elements of Subtitles""","[6, 7]","For the best audio and video quality with the original broadcast English subtitles, look for 'Studio: YA Entertainment' under Product Details. YA Entertainment (YAE) is the licensed US distributor for Time Between Dog and Wolf. YAE works from the original master recordings and hires professinal translators for their DVD releases. Each episode runs about 60 minutes. This set contains the entire series.YAE's subtitles are justifiably considered some of the best in the business.  Although the translators and technicians change from project to project, the quality remains consistent.  Consider the following excerpt from the program.  Two men are talking about the most important thing in their lives---loyalty:'Guys like us, that almost died together, we don't need trust.  We got each other.'The original Korean dialogue is wonderful.  The scene does the emotions at play justice.  YAE's subtitles capture the rhythms and pathos of the scene.  A more literal translation ('Men who have experienced almost dying together don't need things like trust.  Because they are one.') would fail completely.  As always, YAE offers viewers the finest in Korean television, subtitled by a team of technicians and translators that know their business.D.

Then I  bought it because I was running out of things to watch, finally.This is the first time I've felt I had to rush to the computer and write a review for a movie or drama right after I finished watching it. But I have to echo every other reviewer here---this was exciting from beginning to end. As I got to the last 3 hours, I thought ""OK, here it comes, this is where they're going to drop the ball, and drag us slowly through 2 boring hours."" Boy was I wrong, it just kept speeding up! The ending surprised me too, all the way around.

The plot switches alone keep one on their toes.  On top of that the plot moves forward and back and relocates geographically as well.  The main character played by Lee Jung-ki has personality changes that seem to demand costume and hairstyle updates as well.  This may sound fairly ridiculous, but somehow it all works.  Lee has proved to be more than a pretty face with this almost Shakespearian work.
