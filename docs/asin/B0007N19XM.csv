883125,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B0007N19XM,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Wooly Boys, 2001 filmThe story begins with a flock of sheep on dry grass. Can a horse herd sheep? A man gets a medical treatment. [Are porcupines found in that area?] Two men plan to get cash but are surprised by Stony and leave. Later a Deputy talks to Stony and leaves with him. [A ""wooly boy"" refers to a sheepherder; they live in a small wagon.] Should Stony call his daughter in Minnesota? Will he buy a round trip ticket on the hound to see his daughter and grandson in Minneapolis? Yes. He is buzzed in to a large ultra-modern house. He wanders into a darkened room to talk to a young Charles. He visits his daughter Katy. This was to get him into a hospital for an examination. ""Happy Birthday, Dad!"" But Stony has an aneurysm and becomes a patient. Can he be freed? ""Holy Crap!"" A getaway in a hearse? ""North Dakota?"" Stony has an idea to get a suit of clothes, slightly used.They stop for gas on the trip to North Dakota. Will dropping a cell phone destroy it? Back home two brothers try to steal Stony's sheep. Can they steal his horse too? What happens if Stony gets an attack while driving? The FBI is notified about crossing state lines with a dead body. When they return they learn about the missing horse and sheep. Where's the bathroom? Taking a bath in daytime? Charles sees the sights on the ranch. Stony talks about his health to Charles. [That knife looks too shiny to be very old.] One ewe is sick. Charles cleans his hands to work on the delivery by reaching inside to pull it out hooves first. ""I did it!"" He ties off the cord and puts iodine on the cut end. Kate gets the bad news and settles the deal. What happened to the horse? They locate it in a locked corral. Stony rides it away, then drives it away. Agent Collins is there to arrest them for transporting a cadaver across state lines. But the horse was hit!Billy complains to the Sheriff. Agent Collins wants a convoy to the ranch. Stony has a wall of photographs. Charles must feed that lamb. The convoy arrives at Stony's place. ""Is everybody here insane?"" asks his daughter. Agent Collins will search at first light; he placed a tracker to follow the locals. But Charles takes it along. Stony falls off his horse. Can Charles ride to a higher ground for cell phone service? Can he send a message to distract his pursuers? Stony expires. [He died with his boots on.] They find the ""Hidden Springs"" (but little water).] Is that laptop computer ""product placement""? And so it ends. Charles will return in the summer.This is a weird comedy set in a rural area. It is too serious for a comedy and too comic for a drama about life in a rural sheep raising country. But its worth watching once. The implausible events seem to be created for comedy. No mention about the legal problems created.",2,A Weird Comedy,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",2013,2772,"['Wooly', 'Boys', '2001', 'filmThe', 'story', 'flock', 'sheep', 'dry', 'grass', 'Can', 'horse', 'herd', 'sheep', 'man', 'medical', 'treatment', 'Are', 'found', 'area', ']', 'Two', 'men', 'plan', 'get', 'cash', 'are', 'surprised', 'Stony', 'leave', 'Later', 'Deputy', 'talks', 'Stony', '[', 'wooly', 'boy', 'refers', 'sheepherder', 'live', 'small', 'wagon', ']', 'Should', 'Stony', 'call', 'daughter', 'Minnesota', 'Will', 'buy', 'round', 'trip', 'ticket', 'hound', 'see', 'daughter', 'grandson', 'Minneapolis', 'Yes', 'buzzed', 'large', 'ultra-modern', 'house', 'darkened', 'room', 'talk', 'young', 'Charles', 'daughter', 'Katy', 'was', 'get', 'hospital', 'examination', 'Happy', 'Birthday', 'Dad', 'Stony', 'aneurysm', 'patient', 'Can', 'be', 'freed', 'Holy', 'Crap', 'getaway', 'hearse', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Stony', 'idea', 'get', 'suit', 'clothes', 'slightly', 'used.They', 'stop', 'gas', 'trip', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Will', 'dropping', 'cell', 'phone', 'destroy', 'Back', 'home', 'two', 'brothers', 'try', 'steal', 'Stony', 'sheep', 'Can', 'steal', 'horse', 'too', 'What', 'Stony', 'attack', 'driving', 'FBI', 'notified', 'crossing', 'state', 'lines', 'dead', 'body', 'When', 'return', 'learn', 'missing', 'horse', 'sheep', 'Where', 'bathroom', 'Taking', 'bath', 'daytime', 'Charles', 'sights', 'ranch', 'Stony', 'talks', 'health', 'Charles', '[', 'knife', 'too', 'shiny', 'be', 'very', 'old', ']', 'One', 'ewe', 'sick', 'Charles', 'hands', 'work', 'delivery', 'reaching', 'inside', 'pull', 'out', 'hooves', 'first', 'did', 'cord', 'iodine', 'cut', 'end', 'Kate', 'bad', 'news', 'deal', 'What', 'happened', 'horse', 'locate', 'locked', 'corral', 'Stony', 'away', 'then', 'away', 'Agent', 'Collins', 'there', 'arrest', 'transporting', 'cadaver', 'state', 'lines', 'horse', 'was', 'hit', 'Billy', 'Sheriff', 'Agent', 'Collins', 'convoy', 'ranch', 'Stony', 'wall', 'photographs', 'Charles', 'must', 'feed', 'lamb', 'convoy', 'Stony', 'place', 'everybody', 'here', 'insane', 'daughter', 'Agent', 'Collins', 'will', 'search', 'first', 'light', 'placed', 'tracker', 'follow', 'locals', 'Charles', 'along', 'Stony', 'horse', 'Can', 'Charles', 'ride', 'higher', 'ground', 'cell', 'phone', 'service', 'Can', 'send', 'message', 'distract', 'pursuers', 'Stony', '[', 'died', 'boots', ']', 'find', 'Hidden', 'Springs', 'little', 'water', ']', 'laptop', 'computer', 'product', 'placement', 'Charles', 'will', 'return', 'summer.This', 'weird', 'comedy', 'set', 'rural', 'area', 'too', 'serious', 'comedy', 'too', 'comic', 'drama', 'life', 'rural', 'sheep', 'raising', 'country', 'worth', 'watching', 'once', 'implausible', 'events', 'seem', 'be', 'created', 'comedy', 'mention', 'legal', 'problems', 'created']",Wooly Boys

I don't mind the fact that it's formulaic (I bought it because I was expecting a typical family movie), but the characters just aren't well-developed enough. I liked the idea of Peter Fonda's character, but I think Fonda's execution was poor. He spends most of the movie acting like his character is not physically ill but rather psychologically ill. I got the impression that his ""Easy Rider"" character had grown older and drug-addled (since he spends much of the movie staring off into the distance or mumbling about his ""woolies"") and had settled down to become a sheep rancher. Add in the unnecessary, though not overabundant, profanity and I was doubly disappointed (mainly because this is supposed to be family fare).The bottom line is that this movie could have been a lot better. Its redeeming quality is the fact that the teen boy does learn some life lessons and develop a relationship with his estranged grandfather.

Actually this 2001 film only suffered two shameless rip-off films: the truly miserableSecondhand Lionsand the much better Robert Redford filmAn Unfinished Life.Here we have a gangly Joseph Mazzello playing a spoilt teen who goes off to see his grandfather ~ the crusy Peter Fonda in the best role I've seen him play since his Oscar-winningUlee's Gold(see my review). His sidekick is the even crustier Kris Kristofferson, who is damned good here.These boys are sheep farmers (hence ""wooly boys"" as they are known). Before the summer is out, little spoiled city-slicker Joseph Mazzello will know what it is to love and live, chasing sheep on horseback and getting to know his grandfather, whom he also realizes he resembles in personality.This is a fine family film, beautifully acted and not so heavy on the emotions.

The film had a great cast, there were many funny parts, especially at the beginning when Charles (Mazzello) is ""kidnapped"" by his grandfather and friend Chuck, the whole ride over is really funny and most of the comedy comes from the driver who was forced to drive them. The scenery was great and I would expect that considering the film was filmed at the location the movie is supposed to take place at, North Dakota. Many people compare the film to SecondHand Lions saying that it just copy'd the film but they fail to realize that SecondHand Lions actually came out AFTER this film, Wooly Boys was originally released in theaters for a limited release in 2001 but finally arived on DVD right now in 2005. SecondHand Lions came out in 2004, three years after Wooly Boys, so that really annoys me, SecondHand Lions was also a great film though. Pick up a copy, you probably won't be dissapointed.The general plot outline is about a young man, in his late teens, Charles (Joseph Mazzello who stars in Jurassic Park and Simon Birch), Charles is all about the city and wouldn't have it any other way but when his grandfather gets tricked into going to the hospital to get a checkup on a sickness he has, his grandfathers friend, Chuck, comes to take him out, and after succeeding, take Charles along with them to there ranch out in North Dakota. Along the way, Charles finally realizes the beauty of nature and learns to have a great time, and in the end, becomes a 'wooly boy.'The film is very heartwarming and in the end, turns into a sad, but funny tale that makes you want to go out and travel into the world of nature and adventure.",4,Great Family Friendly Film,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",2005,1853,"['thought', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'great', 'picked', 'copy', 'up', 'store', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'already', 'knew', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'was', 'considering', 'hes', 'always', 'starring', '4', '5', 'star', 'worthy', 'films', 'film', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'were', 'many', 'funny', 'parts', 'especially', 'beginning', 'when', 'Charles', 'Mazzello', 'kidnapped', 'grandfather', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'whole', 'ride', 'really', 'funny', 'most', 'comedy', 'driver', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'drive', 'scenery', 'was', 'great', 'would', 'expect', 'considering', 'film', 'was', 'filmed', 'location', 'movie', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'North', 'Dakota', 'Many', 'people', 'compare', 'film', 'SecondHand', 'Lions', 'saying', 'just', 'copy', ""'d"", 'film', 'fail', 'realize', 'SecondHand', 'Lions', 'actually', 'came', 'out', 'AFTER', 'film', 'Wooly', 'Boys', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'theaters', 'limited', 'release', '2001', 'finally', 'arived', 'DVD', 'right', 'now', '2005', 'SecondHand', 'Lions', 'came', 'out', '2004', 'three', 'years', 'Wooly', 'Boys', 'really', 'SecondHand', 'Lions', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'film', 'Pick', 'up', 'copy', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed.The', 'general', 'plot', 'outline', 'young', 'man', 'late', 'teens', 'Charles', 'Joseph', 'Mazzello', 'who', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Simon', 'Birch', 'Charles', 'city', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'other', 'way', 'when', 'grandfather', 'tricked', 'going', 'hospital', 'get', 'checkup', 'sickness', 'grandfathers', 'friend', 'Chuck', 'take', 'out', 'succeeding', 'take', 'Charles', 'along', 'there', 'ranch', 'North', 'Dakota', 'way', 'Charles', 'finally', 'beauty', 'nature', 'learns', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'end', ""'wooly"", 'boy', 'film', 'very', 'heartwarming', 'end', 'sad', 'funny', 'tale', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'travel', 'world', 'nature', 'adventure']",Wooly Boys

883145,A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,B0007N19XM,R. Kyle,"[20, 22]","Sort of a cross between ""Second Hand Lions"" (but better) and ""Thelma and Louise.""  Peter Fonda is an aging sheep-rancher who's dying.  He's not had contact with his daughter or grandson since his wife died in a tragic accident falling off a horse. He's tricked into coming into the city to check up on his daughter only to discover that they've set him up for a physical eval.  The doctors discover an aneurism.Kristofferson shows up to liberate his boss from the hospital.  In the melee, Fonda's young grandson comes along for a wild ride that starts with stealing a hearse and ends with an FBI chase.This is a great film, a lot of honest laughs, and a lot of hard tears.  Dakota, the sheepherding horse, was one of the funniest characters in the film.  ""Wooly Boys"" is definitely a film I would view more than once and I am contemplating adding it to my collection.If you enjoy the old style Westerns with a lot of humor and heart, this is definitely a film you should consider watching.",4,Great family film,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,989,"['Sort', 'cross', 'Second', 'Hand', 'Lions', 'better', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'aging', 'sheep-rancher', 'who', 'dying', 'not', 'had', 'contact', 'daughter', 'grandson', 'wife', 'died', 'tragic', 'accident', 'falling', 'off', 'horse', 'tricked', 'coming', 'city', 'check', 'up', 'daughter', 'only', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'set', 'up', 'physical', 'eval', 'doctors', 'discover', 'aneurism.Kristofferson', 'up', 'liberate', 'boss', 'hospital', 'melee', 'Fonda', 'young', 'grandson', 'along', 'wild', 'ride', 'stealing', 'hearse', 'FBI', 'chase.This', 'great', 'film', 'lot', 'honest', 'laughs', 'lot', 'hard', 'tears', 'Dakota', 'sheepherding', 'horse', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'characters', 'film', 'Wooly', 'Boys', 'definitely', 'film', 'would', 'view', 'more', 'once', 'am', 'contemplating', 'adding', 'collection.If', 'enjoy', 'old', 'style', 'lot', 'humor', 'heart', 'definitely', 'film', 'should', 'consider', 'watching']",Wooly Boys
