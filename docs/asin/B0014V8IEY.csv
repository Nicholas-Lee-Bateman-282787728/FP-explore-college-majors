This is the true, moving story of the massacre of 22,000 Polish officers by the Russians - who then tried to pawn the deed off on the Germans for the next five decades.

Steiner ""Huskarl1066""","[3, 3]","This movie is very well done, and acted, and the only fault I found, although I was looking for none, was the NKVD use of the Walther P.38 when executing the Polish officers.  The Germans themselves were just starting production of this pistol in 1940, after the transition from the Walther HP.  A very minor point.  Saving the visuals and drama of the executions until the final moments of the film was most effective.  The lies of the Soviet murders and cover-up continued for about 50 years.

Salama,"[2, 3]","Veteran Polish director Andrzej Wajda take on the Katyn Massacre, the 1940 execution in a few days (probably a world record in mass murder) of some 20,000 Polish officers captured during the previous year invasion of Eastern Poland by the Soviet Union (in complicity with Nazi Germany who had invaded the western part of Poland).As the movie begins, the Polish officers are being transported in trains to the Soviet Union as prisoners. Meanwhile the Germans are also doing mischief in their controlled part of Poland, detaining the professors of Krakow University and sending them to cocentration camps. After a brief interlude in World War II, the movie moves on to the post war. In new communist Poland, when one of the widows of the slain officers tries to inquire to authorities about his fate, she is told is better to kept quiet. The movie ends with a recreation of some of the executions.Meant primarily for a Polish audience, this is a well made film, with good production values, but also curiously (for lack of a better word and given the subject matter) bloodless (the most moving part of the film is a real Nazi newsreel that shows the mass graves being exhumed by the Germans for propaganda purposes).

1147294,A23BTLTIHMJN01,B0014V8IEY,A. Simon,"[4, 4]","You have to feel for the Poles. The Russians have repeatedly raped Poland over the centuries.The Katyn massacre is one of those items that make up That Which Must Not Be Mentioned about WWII. Another one is that the Soviet Union and the Third Reich were Allies during the first few years of the war as they had agreed to partition Europe between them, starting with Poland. Later, when one of the allies attacked the other one, the original pact of alliance was never mentioned, as being in bad taste if you did.The Katyn massacre, in particular, made a deep scar in the Polish psyche, more so than the Nazi occupation. Perhaps it was due because Russia invaded the country when it was trying to fight off the German invasion, perhaps because the subsequent occupation by the Communists tried to convince the Poles that the Russians were their friends, perhaps because the Russians refused to acknowledge what everyone knew. Who knows.The ending of the film is brutal to watch, but it needs to be watched.Another thing that makes one sick is that the Poles behaved with honor towards the conquerors, not realizing at the time what vicious monsters they were dealing with. Example: (a) the professors naively show up at the university, summoned by the SS officer, only to be brutally rounded up and sent to Sachsenhausen (b) the Polish officers are initially loosely guarded, which means that many could have easily escaped, but did not do so and therefore were subsequently butchered by the Communists.I did not give it five stars because of one fault that the movie has: to people who are unacquainted with the history, as was the case with my wife, events seem to jump. Had the director simply inserted at the right time in the film what is going on historically, e.g., the pact of alliance between Russia and Germany, the subsequent invasion of Russia by Germany, the occupation of Poland by Russia, etc., the movie would have flowed smoothly.",4,Poor Poland,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,1946,"['have', 'feel', 'Poles', 'Russians', 'have', 'repeatedly', 'raped', 'Poland', 'centuries.The', 'Katyn', 'massacre', 'one', 'items', 'make', 'up', 'Which', 'Must', 'Not', 'Be', 'Mentioned', 'WWII', 'one', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Third', 'Reich', 'were', 'Allies', 'first', 'few', 'years', 'war', 'had', 'agreed', 'partition', 'Europe', 'starting', 'Poland', 'Later', 'when', 'one', 'allies', 'attacked', 'other', 'one', 'original', 'pact', 'alliance', 'was', 'never', 'mentioned', 'being', 'bad', 'taste', 'did.The', 'Katyn', 'massacre', 'particular', 'made', 'deep', 'scar', 'Polish', 'psyche', 'more', 'so', 'Nazi', 'occupation', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'Russia', 'invaded', 'country', 'when', 'was', 'trying', 'fight', 'off', 'German', 'invasion', 'perhaps', 'subsequent', 'occupation', 'Communists', 'tried', 'convince', 'Poles', 'Russians', 'were', 'friends', 'perhaps', 'Russians', 'refused', 'acknowledge', 'what', 'everyone', 'knew', 'Who', 'knows.The', 'ending', 'film', 'brutal', 'watch', 'be', 'watched.Another', 'thing', 'one', 'sick', 'Poles', 'behaved', 'honor', 'conquerors', 'not', 'realizing', 'time', 'what', 'vicious', 'monsters', 'were', 'dealing', 'Example', 'professors', 'naively', 'show', 'up', 'university', 'summoned', 'SS', 'officer', 'only', 'be', 'brutally', 'rounded', 'up', 'sent', 'Sachsenhausen', 'b', 'Polish', 'officers', 'are', 'initially', 'loosely', 'guarded', 'many', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'escaped', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'therefore', 'were', 'subsequently', 'butchered', 'Communists.I', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'one', 'fault', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'unacquainted', 'history', 'was', 'case', 'wife', 'events', 'seem', 'jump', 'Had', 'director', 'simply', 'inserted', 'right', 'time', 'film', 'what', 'going', 'historically', 'e.g.', 'pact', 'alliance', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'subsequent', 'invasion', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'occupation', 'Poland', 'Russia', 'etc.', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'flowed', 'smoothly']",N/A

Having a Polish grandfather, I heard about it often as a kid. Years later, I discovered that one of my relatives, a Polish officer was murder there too.It was, both a massacre designed to destroy Poland and a cover up. This film deals with both parts with reference to the murder of the Polish officers which is actually only about a third of the killings.One point that I did find distasteful in the movie is that Poland before WW2 was a much more diverse society than now. Many that died in Katyn were not Polish Catholics. Large numbers of Orthodox, Jews and some Muslims were among those executed. These people have been written out of the movie.The acting was not particularly good. Many of the characters development, I thought was weak. The filming was good.I think it was the strong story line and good directing that made it for me such a good movie.I particularly liked the killing scenes at the end. It looked very accurate. The officers names checked off, he being taken to the cell, shot in the back of the head  and then being dumped on the trucks.By the way, Vasili Blokhin the man that did the actual killing holds earned the Guinness World Record for 'Most Prolific Executioner'.

1147296,AKUIYX3PU2PJL,B0014V8IEY,Carmen Ferreiro-Esteban,"[6, 6]","In the spring of 1940, 20,000 people, 12,000 of them Polish officers, were executed under direct orders from Stalin and buried in common graves in the Katyn forest.The Germans found the graves in 1943, as they advanced into Russia. They exhumed and identified the bodies, and released the names of the dead to the Polish population attributing the massacre to the Soviets. ([...])But when the war ended, the Soviets who, by then, held Poland with an iron hand blamed the Nazis for the slaughter. As dissidents were tortured and killed, most Polish didn't challenge the official story. Only in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian president accepted responsibility for the incident.In the movie Katyn ([...]), Andrzej Wajda (whose father was one of the officers killed in Katyn), recounts this historical event. He does not judge but presents the facts with a dispassionate eye that only enhance the absolute horror of the massacre.As the movie begins a crowd of civilians, mainly women and children, waits at the end of a bridge. They are fleeing the Nazis invasion. A man runs towards them from the other side of the bridge, yelling, telling them to turn back because the soviets have crossed the border. Panic ensues, and you are there, caught, like Poland was during the war, between the Nazis and the Soviets, two powerful nations intent on victory at any cost.The Polish government, we soon learn, has capitulated without fighting and surrounded its officers to the Soviets before leaving the country. The officers are taken prisoners, but their fate is sealed. As an officer tells another prisoner on their last Christmas Day, ""They cannot let us go. The soviets wouldn't want 12,000 Polish officers on their back while they fight the Germans"".The movie, as beautiful and affecting as it is restrained, follows the fate of four officers and the families of three of them. The officers are dead and their families eventually learn of their fate but, as Germans and Soviets blame each other, the truth is hard to know or accept. It's also dangerous.To say that '1940' is the real date of the massacre means to defy the Soviets that claim the Germans did it in 1942 as they advanced into Russia. Agnieszka, the sister of a young lieutenant who died in Katyn, knows this. Yet she orders a tombstone with the right date to set upon her brother's grave and, for this, she's taken into custody. Her sister, on the other hand, accepts the Soviet version and tries to live under their rule.It's proof of the genius of the filmmaker that he manages to show both sisters in a sympathetic light. How many compromises, he seems to be telling us, each of us is willing to make in order to survive is an unknown until we are confronted with the choice in real life.Katyn is a powerful, unforgettable story that needed to be told.",5,Does a lie becomes the truth if told often enough?,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2842,"['spring', '1940', '20,000', 'people', '12,000', 'Polish', 'officers', 'were', 'executed', 'direct', 'orders', 'Stalin', 'buried', 'common', 'graves', 'Katyn', 'forest.The', 'Germans', 'found', 'graves', '1943', 'advanced', 'Russia', 'exhumed', 'identified', 'bodies', 'released', 'names', 'dead', 'Polish', 'population', 'attributing', 'massacre', 'Soviets', '[', ']', 'when', 'war', 'ended', 'Soviets', 'who', 'then', 'held', 'Poland', 'iron', 'hand', 'blamed', 'Nazis', 'slaughter', 'dissidents', 'were', 'tortured', 'killed', 'most', 'Polish', 'did', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'official', 'story', 'Only', '1990s', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Russian', 'president', 'accepted', 'responsibility', 'incident.In', 'movie', 'Katyn', '[', ']', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda', 'father', 'was', 'one', 'officers', 'killed', 'Katyn', 'historical', 'event', 'not', 'judge', 'facts', 'dispassionate', 'eye', 'only', 'enhance', 'absolute', 'horror', 'massacre.As', 'movie', 'crowd', 'civilians', 'mainly', 'women', 'children', 'waits', 'end', 'bridge', 'are', 'fleeing', 'Nazis', 'invasion', 'man', 'towards', 'other', 'side', 'bridge', 'yelling', 'telling', 'turn', 'back', 'soviets', 'have', 'crossed', 'border', 'Panic', 'ensues', 'are', 'there', 'caught', 'Poland', 'was', 'war', 'Nazis', 'Soviets', 'two', 'powerful', 'nations', 'intent', 'victory', 'cost.The', 'Polish', 'government', 'soon', 'learn', 'capitulated', 'fighting', 'surrounded', 'officers', 'Soviets', 'leaving', 'country', 'officers', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoners', 'fate', 'sealed', 'officer', 'prisoner', 'last', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'can', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'soviets', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', '12,000', 'Polish', 'officers', 'back', 'fight', 'Germans', '.The', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'affecting', 'restrained', 'fate', 'four', 'officers', 'families', 'three', 'officers', 'are', 'dead', 'families', 'eventually', 'learn', 'fate', 'Germans', 'Soviets', 'blame', 'other', 'truth', 'hard', 'know', 'accept', 'also', 'dangerous.To', 'say', ""'1940"", 'real', 'date', 'massacre', 'defy', 'Soviets', 'claim', 'Germans', 'did', '1942', 'advanced', 'Russia', 'Agnieszka', 'sister', 'young', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'died', 'Katyn', 'orders', 'tombstone', 'right', 'date', 'set', 'brother', 'grave', 'taken', 'custody', 'sister', 'other', 'hand', 'Soviet', 'version', 'tries', 'live', 'rule.It', 'proof', 'genius', 'filmmaker', 'show', 'sisters', 'sympathetic', 'light', 'How', 'many', 'compromises', 'be', 'telling', 'willing', 'make', 'order', 'survive', 'unknown', 'are', 'confronted', 'choice', 'real', 'life.Katyn', 'powerful', 'unforgettable', 'story', 'needed', 'be', 'told']",N/A

Even in that limited format, ""Katyn"" had an impact on me comparable to such cinematic greats as ""Lawrence of Arabia."" I cried throughout most of the film. I resolved that many of my relationships would be different. I remembered people I had known who reminded me of characters in the movie. After the film ended, I felt that I could not listen to the radio or read the newspaper or listen to anyone speak. I just needed to allow the film to sink into me.Naysayers have critiqued ""Katyn"" as boring and dull. If you need a film to depict war, occupation, and atrocity as shiny, compact, and compelling as a sports car, then you should listen to those naysayers; don't watch ""Katyn,"" rather, watch the very silly, teen fanboy-friendly Quentin Tarantino flic, ""Inglorious Bastards."" If you've seen enough Hollywood productions jam-packed with sexy Nazis and happy endings, and you want to take in a film that dares to depict, in eyeblinks, what war, atrocity, and occupation looked like and felt like to real people, then by all means see ""Katyn."" One of the many features that I admired: ""Katyn""'s Nazis are not sexy. They are not Tom Cruise, Liam Neeson, Christoph Waltz. ""Katyn""'s Nazis are brutal, repugnant thugs.I respect this movie. There are too few movies about which I'd say that. It shows the courage not to attempt to weave an uplifting, feel-good atrocity narrative that leaves the viewer with a smile. This isn't ""Schindler's List."" ""Schindler's List"" is a very good movie, but this isn't that. It is, rather, very much like what World War Two and the subsequent Soviet occupation sounded like to me when I listened to my own older friends and relatives, who lived through both. This is disjointed narrative, stories that seem headed for redemption or even ecstasy but that end in random death, that end in aborted normalcy, aborted joy, aborted meaning. I felt, in watching these cold, pale, stoic characters, as if I were, once again, sitting across the table from older Eastern European friends and relatives. Yes, that's what they looked like. Yes, those are the facial expressions they assumed when they talked about the uncle who was rounded up and never heard from again, the daring, handsome lad who ended up in a mass grave - or when they pointedly did *not* talk about these people. The gravestone whose inscription dares to tell the truth; the tearing down of a propaganda poster; the Red Army soldier who struggles to do the right thing by a widow, who won't yet admit that she is a widow; the singing of exactly the right Christmas carol at exactly the right moment: those are exactly the heroic gestures that no one ever saw, that went unrecorded, that only one person lived to tell about, to tell me. Here they are, onscreen.When a movie is named ""Katyn"" the viewer knows how it will end; it's kind of like a movie named ""Auschwitz"" or ""Kolyma"" or ""Wounded Knee.""

The director, in my opinion, doesn't handle this well. We start off with a pious officer turning down his imploring family and refusing the chance to escape a chaotic prison camp because he must stay behind with his men. He then whiles away the time writing a diary and chatting with his friends. Meanwhile, his wife manages to escape from Soviet-occupied eastern Poland to the German-occupied west, where things aren't much better. The film is too long and contains a lot of dead air. The characters are not particularly strong or believable and the plotting is weak. At the end, we see (in a series of remarkably explicit scenes) a bunch of officers having the backs of their heads blown off by Soviet agents. One of the Poles survives by becoming a turncoat and doing Moscow's work, and then we see the start of the official effort to blame the Germans for the killing. The Polish turncoat gets drunk and shoots himself.

I watched every minute of the extras included on the DVD (all included English subtitles) and felt as though I could not learn enough of this horrible atrocity and the cover-up that lasted almost 50 years. It wassn't until 1989 when Mikhail Gorbachev, then President of the U.S.S.R., finally released documentation substantiating Stalin himself gave the order to carry out this massacre. My heart-felt thanks and appreciation is extended to all those involved in bringing this story to the big screen, and my sympathy is extended to the survivors of those murdered.

HupFons ""Hup234""","[6, 6]","KATYN is an heart-wrenching revelation of a little known Soviet Army atrocity that obliterated much of WWII Poland's middle & upper class male population.  By watching the nearly 50-minute Special Feature interview with director Andrzej Wajda it stunned me to discover that the film is portraying for the first time to Polish and international audiences a shocking story of the long-covered up execution-style murders of 20,000 Army officers, priests, policemen, business owners, alleged spies, and others who made up the intellectual, military, industrial and religious sectors of Poland.Wajda's masterful directorial touch presents the story of this sinister slaughter principally from the point of view of 2 wives and young daughters of Polish officers.  Anna (Maja Ostaszewska), is the wife of an Army cavalry captain who keeps a detailed diary of his imprisonment -- from his initial transport by train from Krakow until the day of his execution in a remote area known as Katyn.  The other wife is Roza, the wife of a Polish general who is sent by train to a Soviet detention camp with thousands of his own troops.Wajda, whose own father was killed in the Katyn massacre, captures the angst and despondency of the women and daughters at the disappearance and complete secrecy regarding the whereabouts and condition of their loved ones (husbands & fathers).  Wajda, who was a young teen at the time of the evacuation, ruefully mentions to the Special Feature interviewer the emotional impact on him and his own mother regarding the displacement, absence and eventual death of his father.  Such personal grief as his mother's and his own seems to strongly have influenced the point of view that he decided to portray in the film.The acting of the entire cast is powerful.  Of special note is Andrzej Chyra, a well-known Polish actor, who gives a nuanced performance as an Army lieutenant.  Chyra, as Lt. Jerzy Porucznik befriends the cavalry major (Artur Zmijewski) shortly before the 2 are separated.  One brief interaction between the 2 officers results in a distressing turn of affairs that leads to added turmoil for Anna and her daughter and eventually for Jerzy himself.The story ends powerfully, as the truth of what occurred at Katyn comes to light, the details of which should be reserved for those who choose to watch this film.  The soundtrack adds to the dramatic moments of the story without overpowering or substituting music for what is to be seen and heard about the characters & situations presented onscreen.",4,Coverup of an Atrocity Finally Revealed,1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,2530,"['KATYN', 'heart-wrenching', 'revelation', 'little', 'known', 'Soviet', 'Army', 'atrocity', 'obliterated', 'much', 'WWII', 'Poland', 'middle', 'upper', 'class', 'male', 'population', 'watching', 'nearly', '50-minute', 'Special', 'Feature', 'interview', 'director', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda', 'stunned', 'discover', 'film', 'portraying', 'first', 'time', 'Polish', 'international', 'audiences', 'shocking', 'story', 'long-covered', 'execution-style', 'murders', '20,000', 'Army', 'officers', 'priests', 'policemen', 'business', 'owners', 'alleged', 'spies', 'others', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'intellectual', 'military', 'industrial', 'religious', 'sectors', 'Poland.Wajda', 'masterful', 'directorial', 'touch', 'story', 'sinister', 'slaughter', 'principally', 'point', 'view', '2', 'wives', 'young', 'daughters', 'Polish', 'officers', 'Anna', 'Maja', 'Ostaszewska', 'wife', 'Army', 'cavalry', 'captain', 'who', 'detailed', 'diary', 'imprisonment', 'initial', 'transport', 'train', 'Krakow', 'day', 'execution', 'remote', 'area', 'known', 'Katyn', 'other', 'wife', 'Roza', 'wife', 'Polish', 'general', 'who', 'sent', 'train', 'Soviet', 'detention', 'camp', 'thousands', 'own', 'troops.Wajda', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'killed', 'Katyn', 'massacre', 'angst', 'despondency', 'women', 'daughters', 'disappearance', 'complete', 'secrecy', 'regarding', 'whereabouts', 'condition', 'loved', 'ones', 'husbands', 'fathers', 'Wajda', 'who', 'was', 'young', 'teen', 'time', 'evacuation', 'ruefully', 'mentions', 'Special', 'Feature', 'interviewer', 'emotional', 'impact', 'own', 'mother', 'regarding', 'displacement', 'absence', 'eventual', 'death', 'father', 'Such', 'personal', 'grief', 'mother', 'own', 'strongly', 'have', 'influenced', 'point', 'view', 'decided', 'portray', 'film.The', 'acting', 'entire', 'cast', 'powerful', 'special', 'note', 'Andrzej', 'Chyra', 'well-known', 'Polish', 'actor', 'who', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'Army', 'lieutenant', 'Chyra', 'Lt.', 'Jerzy', 'Porucznik', 'cavalry', 'major', 'Artur', 'Zmijewski', 'shortly', '2', 'are', 'separated', 'One', 'brief', 'interaction', '2', 'officers', 'results', 'distressing', 'turn', 'affairs', 'added', 'turmoil', 'Anna', 'daughter', 'eventually', 'Jerzy', 'himself.The', 'story', 'powerfully', 'truth', 'what', 'occurred', 'Katyn', 'light', 'details', 'should', 'be', 'reserved', 'who', 'choose', 'watch', 'film', 'soundtrack', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'story', 'overpowering', 'substituting', 'music', 'what', 'be', 'seen', 'heard', 'characters', 'situations', 'presented', 'onscreen']",N/A

While Gorbachev acknowledged Soviet responsibility of the massacre of 21,857 Polish officers (and other Polish individuals the Soviets targeted for execution in order to help ensure minimized resistance of the Soviet takeover) in the Katyn forest in 1940, decades of denial by the Soviets (who blamed the German military), and the continued refusal of Russia to describe the event as a war crime for which Stalin himself was responsible, continues to bring heartache to millions of Poles. As quoted by ""The Wall Street Journal"" yesterday, historian Norman Davies remarked that ""Katyn is in a way the most important event in World War II in Polish minds, more so than the Holocaust. People get very angry about this and say it shows Poles are being anti-Semetic. They're not. The difference is that the whole world has been told about the Holocaust"". This reviewer has empathy towards Poles, because as a descendant of the Donauschwaben, public unawareness of the events that occurred during the period immediately following the second world war continues. This screen adaptation of ""Post Mortem: The Story of Katyn"", by Andrzej Mularczyk, deserves the Oscar nomination it received. The start of the film shows Poles frantically running, uncertain where to go, since Poland was surrounded by Soviet forces entering from the east, and German forces entering from the west, and the drawn out aspect of this scene helps the viewer momentarily identify, at least a little bit, with what the situation must have been like. In addition, events are viewed through the perspective of the wives, mothers, and daughters of victims, and the realistic portrayal of family relationships brings a dimension that is often lacking in films of a similar genre. And portions of German newsreels that present the massacre as a Soviet crime, and portions of Soviet newreels that present the massacre as a German crime, are played during this movie, providing some grounding. Given the history surrounding Katyn, it is surprising that Russia aired this movie on prime-time television. Not surprising is that in April 2009 authorities of the People's Republic of China banned this film from being distributed in the country due to ""its ideology being not in line with the official view of the Chinese state"".",4,Chilling,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",2010,2495,"['week', 'ago', 'April', '10', '2010', 'Lech', 'Kaczynski', 'president', 'Poland', 'died', 'Tupolev-154', 'air', 'crash', '94', 'other', 'individuals', 'route', '70th', 'anniversary', 'ceremony', 'remember', 'Katyn', 'massacre', 'Gorbachev', 'acknowledged', 'Soviet', 'responsibility', 'massacre', '21,857', 'Polish', 'officers', 'other', 'Polish', 'individuals', 'Soviets', 'targeted', 'execution', 'order', 'help', 'ensure', 'minimized', 'resistance', 'Soviet', 'takeover', 'Katyn', 'forest', '1940', 'decades', 'denial', 'Soviets', 'who', 'blamed', 'German', 'military', 'continued', 'refusal', 'Russia', 'describe', 'event', 'war', 'crime', 'Stalin', 'was', 'responsible', 'bring', 'heartache', 'millions', 'Poles', 'quoted', 'Wall', 'Street', 'Journal', 'yesterday', 'historian', 'Norman', 'Davies', 'remarked', 'Katyn', 'way', 'most', 'important', 'event', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Polish', 'minds', 'more', 'so', 'Holocaust', 'People', 'get', 'very', 'angry', 'say', 'Poles', 'are', 'being', 'anti-Semetic', ""'re"", 'not', 'difference', 'whole', 'world', 'been', 'told', 'Holocaust', 'reviewer', 'empathy', 'towards', 'Poles', 'descendant', 'Donauschwaben', 'public', 'unawareness', 'events', 'occurred', 'period', 'immediately', 'following', 'second', 'world', 'war', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'Post', 'Mortem', 'Story', 'Katyn', 'Andrzej', 'Mularczyk', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'received', 'start', 'film', 'Poles', 'frantically', 'running', 'uncertain', 'where', 'go', 'Poland', 'was', 'surrounded', 'Soviet', 'forces', 'entering', 'east', 'German', 'forces', 'entering', 'west', 'drawn', 'aspect', 'scene', 'viewer', 'momentarily', 'identify', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'situation', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'addition', 'events', 'are', 'viewed', 'perspective', 'wives', 'mothers', 'daughters', 'victims', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'family', 'relationships', 'dimension', 'often', 'lacking', 'films', 'similar', 'genre', 'portions', 'German', 'newsreels', 'present', 'massacre', 'Soviet', 'crime', 'portions', 'Soviet', 'newreels', 'present', 'massacre', 'German', 'crime', 'are', 'played', 'movie', 'providing', 'grounding', 'Given', 'history', 'surrounding', 'Katyn', 'surprising', 'Russia', 'aired', 'movie', 'prime-time', 'television', 'Not', 'surprising', 'April', '2009', 'authorities', 'People', 'Republic', 'China', 'banned', 'film', 'being', 'distributed', 'country', 'due', 'ideology', 'being', 'not', 'line', 'official', 'view', 'Chinese', 'state']",N/A

Directed and co-written by the brilliant Polish illuminist Andrzej Wajda the film recounts in intense and very credible form the history of the annihilation of 22,000 Polish officers and brilliant scientists, philosopher, and artists in the forest of Katyn in the 1940s, an act that was performed by the Russians but blamed on the Nazis.  It was one of the horrors of WW II that served to unite Poland in a manner no other occurrence had.  Andrzej Wajda employs a brilliant cast of fine Polish actors to lead us, the audience, into the understanding of how the incident occurred and the few families whose joint efforts managed to uncover the truth.In addition to the extraordinary acting by this huge cast, the cinematography is on the highest order and the recreation of the period in sets and costumes is as accurate as any on  film.  One of the crowning glories of this moving cinematic experience is the musical score written by none other than the revered classical composer Krysztof Penderecki.

Andrezj Wajda in a forum of filmmakers (Gdansk, 1980)Thinking it carefully and making a zealous backward glance respect the greatest filmmakers of the last century, just a reduced elite of filmmakers may boast of being regarded authentically integral, legitimately committed with an ethical entity and profoundly convinced that although each generation must make efforts about knowing the composition of their historical land in order to suppress the bad grasses that always tend to hide the abominable truth. Among them Wajda must be part of this elite, accompanied by Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer, Andre Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang, Wilhelm Murnau, Akira Kurosawa, Marcel Carne, Kenji Mizoguchi,  and Roberto RoselliniIf Stalin pursued Trotsky until Mexico to kill him, and without a bit of scruples ordered to confiscate the goods of five millions of farmers through the middle twenties without compensating them inside his own territory and making they starved of hunger, inanition and cold, how many heroes or simple officers have been sent to jail, or aseptically eliminated ? Such is the nature of this veridical event. Once Soviets massacred brutally in 1940 thousand of Polish officers and civilian in the Katyn forest, and the War was over the Soviets pretended to attribute these deaths to the Nazis and pray for all of those who disagree with this decision.Since the times of ""The man of marble"" , Wajda - that solid oak- and legitimate descendent of the great Polish Romantic tradition, felt the necessity to express and remind this new generation about this bloody, coward and unjustified massacre.Filmed with astonishing realism, supported by an agile dialogue, the employment of gloomy luminosity to depict the somber mood of the story as well as magnificent performances; the film is viscerally potent and hardly you  will be able to forget it.To my mind, this movie must be regarded as the best Film of 2007 and undoubtedly one of the twelve films of the first decade of this raising century.",5,The truth and nothing more the truth!,1295827200,"01 24, 2011",2011,2154,"['What', 'main', 'duty', 'artist', 'respect', 'Polish', 'reality', 'only', 'answer', 'duty', 'telling', 'truth', 'Andrezj', 'Wajda', 'forum', 'filmmakers', 'Gdansk', '1980', 'Thinking', 'carefully', 'making', 'zealous', 'backward', 'glance', 'respect', 'greatest', 'filmmakers', 'last', 'century', 'just', 'reduced', 'elite', 'filmmakers', 'may', 'boast', 'being', 'regarded', 'authentically', 'integral', 'legitimately', 'committed', 'ethical', 'entity', 'profoundly', 'convinced', 'generation', 'must', 'make', 'efforts', 'knowing', 'composition', 'historical', 'land', 'order', 'suppress', 'bad', 'grasses', 'always', 'tend', 'hide', 'abominable', 'truth', 'Wajda', 'must', 'be', 'part', 'elite', 'accompanied', 'Robert', 'Bresson', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'Andre', 'Tarkovsky', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Fritz', 'Lang', 'Wilhelm', 'Murnau', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'Marcel', 'Carne', 'Kenji', 'Mizoguchi', 'Roberto', 'RoselliniIf', 'Stalin', 'pursued', 'Trotsky', 'Mexico', 'kill', 'bit', 'scruples', 'ordered', 'confiscate', 'goods', 'five', 'millions', 'farmers', 'middle', 'twenties', 'compensating', 'own', 'territory', 'making', 'starved', 'hunger', 'inanition', 'cold', 'how', 'many', 'heroes', 'simple', 'officers', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'jail', 'aseptically', 'eliminated', 'Such', 'nature', 'veridical', 'event', 'Once', 'Soviets', 'massacred', 'brutally', '1940', 'thousand', 'Polish', 'officers', 'civilian', 'Katyn', 'forest', 'War', 'was', 'Soviets', 'pretended', 'attribute', 'deaths', 'Nazis', 'pray', 'who', 'disagree', 'decision.Since', 'times', 'man', 'marble', 'Wajda', 'solid', 'oak-', 'legitimate', 'descendent', 'great', 'Polish', 'Romantic', 'tradition', 'felt', 'necessity', 'express', 'remind', 'new', 'generation', 'bloody', 'coward', 'unjustified', 'massacre.Filmed', 'astonishing', 'realism', 'supported', 'agile', 'dialogue', 'employment', 'gloomy', 'luminosity', 'depict', 'somber', 'mood', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'magnificent', 'performances', 'film', 'viscerally', 'potent', 'hardly', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'forget', 'it.To', 'mind', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'regarded', 'best', 'Film', '2007', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'twelve', 'films', 'first', 'decade', 'raising', 'century']",N/A

Everything in the film is very didactic; the objective being not to forget the massacre perpetrated by the Russians in 1940 and how the Polish people had to live a lie for several decades.Even though the movie is fiction, it is best seen as a dramatised documentary about one incident in the second world war. So unless you are Polish or a history buff you will not like this film.That is not to say that you should not see the movie. In some way it is good that we are getting movies showing the suffering of other people than the Jews. I am not belittling the killing of millions of Jews, but in my opinion we need more stories highlighting the suffering of Poles, Russians, Germans, homosexuals, Singaporeans, Chinese, etc. The Poles never had a rich diaspora so this movie had to wait a long time to be produced.In terms of enjoyment value this movie is worth three stars.

They do not reckon with Stalin's paranoia or Beria's (his secret police chief) rather simple solution to those who oppose the regime.Aside from the murders of the Poles, many of whom had their hands tied with barbed wire and were shot in the back of the head, the director shows the lies which began immediately after the war. The Nazis murdered the officers in 1941 they claimed, following their invasion of the USSR. Anyone who contradicted this idea in the new puppet state, whether student or soldier, would pay a price.

It was once nominated for the Oscar, and is a very moving, educational, and thought-provoking film.The movie begins with the German-Soviet conquest of Poland in 1939. The viewer senses the actions of the aggressors through the eyes of the civilians.But this is only the beginning of Poland's sufferings. Both enemies of Poland begin their genocide of Poles with the best of Polish society. The Germans invite some professors to the university, only to promptly arrest them (for shooting, or slow deaths in concentration camps). The Soviets hold the captured officers and intellectuals at places such as Kozielsk, where the prisoners sing Christmas carols in December 1939. It will be their last Christmas. By spring 1940, the Soviets decide to shoot nearly all of the captive Polish officers.The movie also shows the life of relatives of the Soviet-held men. First there are the letters, and hope for a speedy reunion. Then...silence. Finally, the Germans break the news of their discovery of the Katyn mass graves, and exploit it for propaganda purposes--hoping to divide the Allies. The relatives face the fact that their men will never return.After the war, the suffering of the Katyn relatives continues. Information about the exact fate of the missing men is skimpy. The Soviet puppet state, using the Communist terror police (the UB), tries to force the grieving relatives to sign a statement blaming the Germans for the crime. The relatives also face pressure from others to ""accept reality"" that Poland will never again be free, and must align itself with Soviet dictates. They refuse. Then they have problems sending their son to the university because they won't bow to the Soviet lie about Katyn.Polish movies tell it like it was, and often don't have a happy ending. WARNING: This movie has graphic scenes of the Polish officers being shot and blood being spilled. This may upset sensitive viewers. These scenes come near the end of the movie, as the victims are trucked to the sites of death, and, one-by-one, shot point-blank in the back of the head.

In fact it was not even part of the war, really. Thousands of Polish officers and intellectuals who had escaped German aggression in 1939 were killed in cold blood by the Soviets, supposedly their allies against Hitler, to pursue Stalin's goal of decapitating Poland's leadership so as to better control the occupied and partitioned country. When Germany advanced deep into the USSR and found the bodies it told the world about what happened. The Red Cross confirmed. But in light of the fact that the USSR was fighting on the Allies' side against Germany no one did anything about it.After the war, Poland was occupied by the Soviets and for almost half a century it had to officially acquiesce with the big lie: the Poles at Katyn had been killed by the Germans. It was only with Gorbachev that the truth became undeniable, and gradually the new post Soviet Russian leaders have admitted to Stalin's crime. And it was only in 2010 that the tragic epilogue took place: on their way to Katyn for a joint Russian-Polish commemoration of the events of the 1940s, a Polish plane carrying the President and a number of the country's top officials crashed near Katyn, thus prolonging the agony and the mourning.Wajda has produced a highly commendable masterpiece.",4,A masterpiece on one of the worst episodes of Stalinism,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",2012,1337,"['spine', 'chilling', 'documentary', 'abominable', 'episode', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'part', 'war', 'really', 'Thousands', 'Polish', 'officers', 'intellectuals', 'who', 'had', 'escaped', 'German', 'aggression', '1939', 'were', 'killed', 'cold', 'blood', 'Soviets', 'supposedly', 'allies', 'Hitler', 'pursue', 'Stalin', 'goal', 'decapitating', 'Poland', 'leadership', 'so', 'better', 'control', 'occupied', 'partitioned', 'country', 'When', 'Germany', 'advanced', 'deep', 'USSR', 'found', 'bodies', 'told', 'world', 'what', 'happened', 'Red', 'Cross', 'confirmed', 'light', 'fact', 'USSR', 'was', 'fighting', 'Allies', 'side', 'Germany', 'one', 'did', 'anything', 'it.After', 'war', 'Poland', 'was', 'occupied', 'Soviets', 'almost', 'century', 'had', 'officially', 'acquiesce', 'big', 'lie', 'Poles', 'Katyn', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'Germans', 'was', 'only', 'Gorbachev', 'truth', 'became', 'undeniable', 'gradually', 'new', 'post', 'Soviet', 'Russian', 'leaders', 'have', 'admitted', 'Stalin', 'crime', 'was', 'only', '2010', 'tragic', 'epilogue', 'took', 'place', 'way', 'Katyn', 'joint', 'Russian-Polish', 'commemoration', 'events', '1940s', 'Polish', 'plane', 'carrying', 'President', 'number', 'country', 'top', 'officials', 'crashed', 'Katyn', 'thus', 'prolonging', 'agony', 'mourning.Wajda', 'produced', 'highly', 'commendable', 'masterpiece']",N/A

Directed by Oscar winning director Andrzeg Wajda, this two-hour masterpiece is a witness to courage and tragedy at their extremes.In 1939, Poland occupants are surrounded by the Germans to the west and the Russians to the east.  This is an inescapable situation for the Poles.  There are several families situations that are weaved throughout this film with wife's and daughters searching for their Polish officer husbands, brothers, relatives and friends.  This sets the tone of the film, and personalizes it.  First a wife and daughter find their Polish officer husband as they flee the Germans, only to see him disappear.  A University is visited and the professors are asked to meet with the Russians; a fatal mistake but unavoidable.  Officers and intellectuals are held at various camps, waiting to be executed.In 1940, the Russians murder most of the Polish officers, while letters, rumors and messages are spread from camps to families and back.  It is painful to watch.  The Germans exploit Russia's murderous rampage to gain allies.  Meanwhile, Polish residents are forced to sign allegiance to Russia, but there is a resistance, which is eventually fatal for most.  Director Andrzej Wajda weaves real footage of the discovery of mass graves to the Polish people (actors) in town squares.  (The films are authentic and Wajda splices them perfectly from black and white into the color film).  These films are the most horrific one will see, even in documentaries.  Polish officers are shown being systematically executed in the most egregious style.  This is interweaved with families contemplating what happened or actually finding out the demise of their husbands and sons.  It is heartbreaking.The ending with the actually reenactment of the Polish armies being executed in mass graves while bulldozers  bury the evidence is startling and upsetting.  The final scene with a hand holding a rosary is devastating.  The film is one of the most factual (although the family dynamics are fictional) that one can witness.  Its the kind of film that you understand, can relate to and pulls you in every direction.  You know this happened 70 years ago, but the reality is palpable and upsetting.  There are no light moments - this is the real world.  It is a tribute to the people of Poland and their bravery.This film is for fans of history and the truth.  To date, approximately 22,000 Poles have been found in mass graves in the ""Katyn"" forest and these mass grave discoveries are continuing to be found.",5,Devastating History With No Relief,1253491200,"09 21, 2009",2009,2620,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'stories', 'seem', 'never', 'end', 'Katyn', 'new', 'extremely', 'important', 'part', 'world', 'history', 'Directed', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'director', 'Andrzeg', 'Wajda', 'two-hour', 'masterpiece', 'witness', 'courage', 'tragedy', 'extremes.In', '1939', 'Poland', 'occupants', 'are', 'surrounded', 'Germans', 'west', 'Russians', 'east', 'inescapable', 'situation', 'Poles', 'are', 'several', 'families', 'situations', 'are', 'weaved', 'film', 'wife', 'daughters', 'searching', 'Polish', 'officer', 'husbands', 'brothers', 'relatives', 'friends', 'tone', 'film', 'First', 'wife', 'daughter', 'find', 'Polish', 'officer', 'husband', 'flee', 'Germans', 'only', 'see', 'disappear', 'University', 'visited', 'professors', 'are', 'asked', 'meet', 'Russians', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'unavoidable', 'Officers', 'intellectuals', 'are', 'held', 'various', 'camps', 'waiting', 'be', 'executed.In', '1940', 'Russians', 'murder', 'most', 'Polish', 'officers', 'letters', 'rumors', 'messages', 'are', 'spread', 'camps', 'families', 'back', 'painful', 'watch', 'Germans', 'exploit', 'Russia', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'gain', 'allies', 'Meanwhile', 'Polish', 'residents', 'are', 'forced', 'sign', 'allegiance', 'Russia', 'resistance', 'eventually', 'fatal', 'most', 'Director', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda', 'real', 'footage', 'discovery', 'mass', 'graves', 'Polish', 'people', 'actors', 'town', 'squares', 'films', 'are', 'authentic', 'Wajda', 'perfectly', 'black', 'white', 'color', 'film', 'films', 'are', 'most', 'horrific', 'one', 'will', 'see', 'even', 'documentaries', 'Polish', 'officers', 'are', 'shown', 'being', 'systematically', 'executed', 'most', 'egregious', 'style', 'interweaved', 'families', 'contemplating', 'what', 'happened', 'actually', 'finding', 'out', 'demise', 'husbands', 'sons', 'heartbreaking.The', 'ending', 'actually', 'reenactment', 'Polish', 'armies', 'being', 'executed', 'mass', 'graves', 'bulldozers', 'bury', 'evidence', 'startling', 'upsetting', 'final', 'scene', 'hand', 'holding', 'rosary', 'devastating', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'factual', 'family', 'dynamics', 'are', 'fictional', 'one', 'can', 'witness', 'kind', 'film', 'understand', 'can', 'relate', 'pulls', 'direction', 'know', 'happened', '70', 'years', 'ago', 'reality', 'palpable', 'upsetting', 'are', 'light', 'moments', 'real', 'world', 'tribute', 'people', 'Poland', 'bravery.This', 'film', 'fans', 'history', 'truth', 'date', 'approximately', '22,000', 'Poles', 'have', 'been', 'found', 'mass', 'graves', 'Katyn', 'forest', 'mass', 'grave', 'discoveries', 'are', 'continuing', 'be', 'found']",N/A

1147324,A3ARKIF3FNB5HV,B0014V8IEY,Michael D. Goolsby,"[82, 87]","This was probably the biggest national heartbreak suffered by a single country other than the Holocaust.  It happened when Stalin ordered the NKVD to ""liquidate"" the captured Polish POW's who had the misfortune of being captured by Timoshenko's troops instead of Guderian's or Runstedt's. The ""4th Partition Of Poland"" created a problem for the western allies that would not resurface until 1942 when Stalin's government, who adamantly refused the recognized legitimate government-in-exile in London's request to send the Swiss and the Red Cross over to what the Germans discovered at Katyn.  The Soviets told the world it was a German Atrocity while the Nazis were telling the world that it was a Soviet Atrocity.  Only the Poles and Soviets knew the real truth and no Nazi forensics was going to tell anybody different. The Poles because it affected their families directly when they lost contact with their loved ones captured by the Red Army. The Soviets because they knew exactly who gave the orders as well as who carried those orders out--afterward, many of them who committed the executions themselves would be slaughtered by their co-workers on orders of their superiors.  What few survivors there were from the executioners' side were either discredited because of their mental imbalances or they drunk themselves to their deaths.  It was the lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to break relations with the London Government as well as work to crush the Polish Home Army that was loyal to it. The Home Army fought and died with the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto against the Germans while Rokossovsky's troops were ordered to stand back and let the Germans take out the last vestige of Pilsudski's and Paderewski's Pre-War Poland. Once it was clear that the Germans effectively eradicated all Polish military resistance, The Stavka gave the order with Stalin's blessing for Rokossovsky's forces to take Warsaw from the Germans and continue their drive to the west to take up as much land as possible before the Americans and the British take it.Katyn was the fulcrum by which the Polish people would judge their experience under Communist rule, first under Soviet Occupation and then as a Soviet satellite, a forced ally despite centuries of mistrust between them.  The lies of Katyn that compelled Stalin to set up the Lublin Government in 1942 to counter the London Government and when Rokossovsky took Warsaw, the Lublin Government became the de-facto government of Poland--even though many in its government, including its Minister of Defense, Konstantin Ustinovich Rokossovsky himself, were not Poles.  Because of Katyn, many Poles after the war did not respect the Polish Government as their legitimate government, Let alone the PRP, the Polish Communist Party.The Polish Governments of Wladislaw Gomulka, Stanislav Konya, Edvard Gierek, Konya again and Wojciech Jaruzelski had to walk a balancing act between the Polish people and the Soviets despite the fact that the rest of the world did recognize Gomulka's government as the official government of Poland in the mid-1940s.  It was fait accompli that made it happen, brought about by a Soviet victory which further tried to bury Katyn to the Poles and the rest of the world--even though the rest of the world knew the truth.  Churchill even wrote about it in his history of the Second World War.It wasn't until Gorbachev became General Secretary in Moscow and his calls for openness after the Chernobyl disaster that forced a discussion about Katyn in both Poland and the Soviet Union.  The Poles also learned other truths about their leaders as well, especially Jaruzelski, who during that time was arrested by Smersh troops and and hauled off to a gulag in Siberia, only to be rehabilitated after the war and brought into the ranks of the new Polish Army and the PRP. By discussing the subject of Katyn, the Poles confirmed their beliefs in their common loss, which until this time was considered a loss suffered by specific families.  By this time, the Polish government found itself in an untenable position with their own people and without Gorbachev and his government to support them further. If it was the will of the people to undo their government by either coup or reform, the Red Army would not stand in the way. The only guarantee that Gorbachev would give to Poland was that their territorial integrity especially against Germany would be defended.Jaruzelski had to give opposition parties more legitimacy and even had to allow for the possibility that the PRP could lose its monopoly on political power, especially when the government thus far failed to deliver prosperity to the people it served.  He also had to allow for the possibility that he may also be tried for crimes either for what he did in World War II or even afterward.  The government was between a rock and hard place.  Eventually, that government dissolved peacefully and the opposition parties gathered together with the PRP's successor party, the USDRP.  In the early-1990s, even Jaruzelski tried to paint himself as a reformer in the Gorbachev mold, but his past caught up to him, especially what he did in 1981 trying to squelch the Solidarity movement.The lessons of Katyn are that no matter how deep one tries to bury the truth behind an atrocity, It will always be in the background and will determine how one perceives people who either built the lies or benefited from them. Katyn founded Post-War Poland twice--first in 1942 by its lies and then in 1990 by its truth.",5,Communist Poland Was Built On The Lies Told About Katyn,1248998400,"07 31, 2009",2009,5525,"['was',

It's a finely acted polish movie made about the massacre and it's aftermath.  It's not a standard war movie though with battle scenes though. It is a solid drama based on facts with characters who are realistic and based on composites of real people.

1147328,A1M9WSTQ1M7IGX,B0014V8IEY,"Mogulmeister ""mogulmeister""","[1, 1]","I saw Katyn when it was commercially released in the U.S.  It made a strong impression on me at the time, but what's interesting is that since then, it's never really left the very back of my mind.  I would never pretend that I've seen the majority of Wajda's movies or even a minority of them (I recall three), but this is truly a great film.  But I also believe that the film's actual agenda has not been discussed in any reviews or comments about the movie I've seen.I believe that the actual story of the Katyn Forest Massacre is the backdrop to what the film is really about.  Don't get me wrong, it's certainly front and center in the story, and thankfully Wajda does not concoct some silly improbable romance as a way of telling a difficult story.  But what I saw in the movie seemed less to me about Katyn pure and simple, than a discussion of the nature of the impossible choices Poland was facing post-war when the Soviets were completely in control.What the film does masterfully is successfully convey the impossibilities of living with either the Nazis or the Soviets, and the actual brutalities experienced.  Once World War 2 was over and the Soviets were in control, citizens in Poland has two choices:  cooperate with the Soviet regime and survive, or oppose it (however hopelessly and ineffectively) and get crushed.  What the film shows over and over again in the post-WW2 scenes is that those that tried to resist, however futilely, were destroyed.  The only path forward, the film argues, was cooperation and collaboration.My best guess is that in post-Soviet Poland, a line of argument has emerged in popular discussion that many in the society were guilty of working against Poland's self-interests in the manner that they co-existed or even collabored with the Soviet regime.  I suspect that Wajda's agenda in this movie is to answer that charge, coming from someone who chose the cooperation pathway.  Certainly anyone who's seen ""Man of Marble"" is not going to argue that Wajda was a true-believer in the system, while certainly being integrated in some manner into the power structures of Poland at the time.  But the point that Katyn makes so strongly is, there was no other path forward other than to cooperate with the regime, or to be crushed.This is an intelligent, provocative, and extremely powerful movie.

(The Soviet government did not officially admit that the killings were ordered by Stalin until 1990.)Wajda's masterful film centers on this dismal episode by revealing the webs of commitment and interaction that connect disparate lives - from an impetuous youth, to the staid wife of an executed general. Most all of the movie is an examination of these connections, of how lies and fabrications feed terror, of how in war there are seldom good choices between right and wrong. Only in the closing minutes, after all the victims have been deeply humanized, is the brutal, machine-like horror of the killings brought to center stage. The effect is powerful and profound.The misty cinematography, in hues of brown and grey, evokes the mood and texture of wartime. Characters are richly drawn, and if at times the sudden introduction of new faces is confusing, it is only until one realizes Wajda's intent: these people could be any of us.

The focal point is the massacre of Polish POWs by the Soviets in the Katyn forest in 1940.  Wajda and collaborators use the Katyn massacre and characters connected to the massacre to portray the tragedy that befell Poland.  The brutal occupation of what was then eastern Poland by the Soviets, the Nazi liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia, and the Soviet imposition of a Communist state after the war are shown in a series of direct, unsentimental, and powerful scenes.  The central armature of the film is the story of the Polish POWs slaughtered at Katyn, shown through the experience of a single fictional Polish officer. The majority of those killed at Katyn, and this group reputedly included Wajda's father, were reserve officers of middle class  origin who were perceived as enemies of a communist state.  This episode encapsulates the destruction of pre-war Poland that occurred during WWII.The quality of acting, cinematography, plotting, and even music (featuring work of the great Polish composer Penderecki) is excellent.  Events are presented in a quotidian but cumulatively powerful manner.  The film artfully shows the convergence of many features of Nazi and Soviet totalitarianism.  The great convergence of Catholic faith and Polish nationalism is also shown.

The Soviet Russians were responsible for the Katyn mass murder of 12000 Polish officers.  They committed this heinous crime presumably because they wanted to eliminate the leaders of the country they had recently invaded; fewer leaders, fewer problems.  What made the whole tragic episode even more bizarre was the Third Reich's publicizing the massacre when they came across the scene in their invasion of Russia.What I anticipated out the movie ""Katyn"" was an account of the tragedy with fictional characters to bring to life (and death) the humanity and inhumanity.  What I got from ""Katyn"" was all that plus an appreciation for the Polish perspective of a national tragedy that was compounded by having to live for decades under the iron rule of the perpetrators.

Katyn presents a history lesson that most people never heard about: the mass murder of tens of thousands of Polish officers by the Russians in 1940.  While watching this film you may wonder if the Russians mistreated Poland worse than the Germans did during World War II (which is a debate in itself).The Germans found the massacre site in 1943 and announced it to the Poles, hoping to use it for propaganda against Russia.  The Russians denied the accusation and then staged it to appear the Germans were behind the butchery.  Katyn doesn't tell the story in a chronological way, but we see it unfold slowly; we see both the men at war and the women at home who love them.  The wives, mothers and daughters of the Polish officers spend so much time waiting and wondering what happened to them.  Even when the war ends the problems of the war do not - they spill into the decades that follow.Andrzej Wajda is Poland's best-known director and has been making films for over fifty years.  I think it is great Wajda is still making films because his recent work is opening the door to younger audiences who primarily watch contemporary movies.  He has long ago established himself as being a brilliant director and Katyn reflects his years of experience and talent.Katyn is a story that is strongly based on history and is the first film about the Soviet massacre of nearly 22,000 Polish officers.  I viewed Katyn with someone who lived through this time and he confirmed that even the smallest details were right on and the way it is presented is how it was.

For us in the west, it is a little known World War 2 massacre that oddly enough was perpetrated and executed by Russia.As far as WW2 massacres go, this is a drop in the bucket when compared to the 5 million Poles killed by Germany and another million Poles killed by Russia during WW2.  What is interesting about this incident is how both the Germans and the Russians used it in their war propaganda.  Add to that the 45 year cold war occupation where the Russians suppressed Polish history, and where the Poles really knew who killed who, and now you have an incident that becomes part of the Polish psyche.What I liked about this movie is how it flows in time with visits to the past to clear up matters.  This is a nice touch by the master Polish director, Andrzej Wajda, who weaves the tale through the people most affected by the massacre, the victims and their families.While this movie spans many years, you stay in touch with the families.  Children grow up, mothers get gray hair, and still the story continues.  At this point, many movies would loose focus, but not Katyn.  Wajda keeps tight control over the action and how much knowledge is known.  Like the families, you are kept in the dark about certain things.Wajda does not overly indulge in sentimentality.  This is not a ""boo-hoo, where's daddy"" type of movie.  This movie is about a country and its people caught up in the giant war and occupation machinery of both Germany and Russia.  This is not an enviable place to be.  Also, Wajda does not use cheap action tricks like big bangs to keep the action and tension going.

Both invaders posed a serious threat to the innocent civilians who lived there and none more so than the wives and family members of officers serving in the Polish army.""Katyn,"" the Oscar-nominated film by Andrej Wajda, tells of two such women, Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) and Roza (Danuta Stenka), whose husbands (Artur Zmijewski, Andrzej Chyra) are taken prisoner by the Russian army in late 1939.  Then, in the spring of 1940, in the depths of the Katyn Forest in western Russia, the Soviet guards turned their guns on their captives, shooting down thousands of unarmed men one by one, then burying their bodies in a shallow mass grave.  For years, the Nazis used the massacre as a propaganda tool against the Soviets, but with the defeat of the Nazis and the eventual Communist takeover of Poland, it became the Soviets' turn to exploit the tragedy by declaring the Nazis responsible for the atrocity, even going so far as to move the date of the event to late 1941.  It wasn`t until the eventual overthrow of the Soviets in Poland in the late 1980s that the long-buried truth could finally be revealed.""Katyn"" is an understated, deeply humanistic and superbly acted look at an event that has haunted the Poles for generations.  Veteran director Wajda doesn't go in for grand gestures or cheap sentiment to relate a tale that he knows will open up a gaping moral wound in the psyche of his intended audience.  Instead, the characters in this movie confront the horrors of their lives with an almost matter-of-fact calmness and acceptance, the result, no doubt, of having already experienced death and suffering on an almost daily basis for years up to that point.  All the characters in this film are to some extent victims of their circumstances and of the cruel vagaries of fate, yet even within the proscribed limits of their situations, many still choose to act on their convictions and to try to determine, as much as possible, the course of their own lives and the future of their nation.The screenplay could use a little more streamlining and clarity at times; certain characters pop up seemingly out of nowhere only to fade into the background never to be heard from again.  Yet, despite the somewhat muddled nature of the narrative, the movie shows just how far people are willing to go in denying reality, especially when their reasons for doing so involve fear of governmental retaliation, guilt for having stood by and allowing the atrocity to happen in the first place, patriotic fervor for the homeland, or the desire to simply abandon the past and get on with one's life.  Yet, the movie shows us that in all places and times, and no matter how great the threat or dire the circumstances, there will always be brave people willing to put their lives on the line for truth and justice.This is a subtle movie that, in its own subdued, quiet way, will worm its way into the very center of your soul.  And it ends with a horrifying and profoundly moving scene that will leave any viewer with a heart and a conscience staring at the screen in stunned silence.",4,moving film about the manipulation of truth by the powers-that-be,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,3347,"['World', 'War', 'II', 'citizens', 'Poland', 'found', 'caught', 'squeeze', 'play', 'epic', 'proportions', 'Nazis', 'west', 'Stalinists', 'east', 'two', 'superpowers', 'intent', 'subsuming', 'defeated', 'nation', 'own', 'sphere', 'influence', 'invaders', 'posed', 'serious', 'threat', 'innocent', 'civilians', 'who', 'lived', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'wives', 'family', 'members', 'officers', 'serving', 'Polish', 'army', 'Katyn', 'Oscar-nominated', 'film', 'Andrej', 'Wajda', 'tells', 'two', 'such', 'women', 'Anna', 'Maja', 'Ostaszewska', 'Roza', 'Danuta', 'Stenka', 'husbands', 'Artur', 'Zmijewski', 'Andrzej', 'Chyra', 'are', 'taken', 'prisoner', 'Russian', 'army', 'late', '1939', 'Then', 'spring', '1940', 'depths', 'Katyn', 'Forest', 'western', 'Russia', 'Soviet', 'guards', 'turned', 'guns', 'captives', 'shooting', 'down', 'thousands', 'unarmed', 'men', 'one', 'one', 'then', 'burying', 'bodies', 'shallow', 'mass', 'grave', 'years', 'Nazis', 'used', 'massacre', 'propaganda', 'tool', 'Soviets', 'defeat', 'Nazis', 'eventual', 'Communist', 'takeover', 'Poland', 'became', 'Soviets', 'turn', 'exploit', 'tragedy', 'declaring', 'Nazis', 'responsible', 'atrocity', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'move', 'date', 'event', 'late', '1941', 'wasn', 't', 'eventual', 'overthrow', 'Soviets', 'Poland', 'late', '1980s', 'long-buried', 'truth', 'could', 'finally', 'be', 'revealed', 'Katyn', 'understated', 'deeply', 'humanistic', 'superbly', 'acted', 'look', 'event', 'haunted', 'Poles', 'generations', 'Veteran', 'director', 'Wajda', ""n't"", 'go', 'grand', 'gestures', 'cheap', 'sentiment', 'relate', 'tale', 'will', 'open', 'up', 'gaping', 'moral', 'wound', 'psyche', 'intended', 'audience', 'Instead', 'characters', 'movie', 'horrors', 'lives', 'almost', 'matter-of-fact', 'calmness', 'acceptance', 'result', 'doubt', 'having', 'already', 'experienced', 'death', 'suffering', 'almost', 'daily', 'basis', 'years', 'up', 'point', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'extent', 'victims', 'circumstances', 'cruel', 'vagaries', 'fate', 'yet', 'even', 'proscribed', 'limits', 'situations', 'many', 'still', 'choose', 'act', 'convictions', 'try', 'determine', 'as', 'much', 'possible', 'course', 'own', 'lives', 'future', 'nation.The', 'screenplay', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'more', 'streamlining', 'clarity', 'times', 'certain', 'characters', 'pop', 'up', 'seemingly', 'nowhere', 'only', 'fade', 'background', 'never', 'be', 'heard', 'again', 'somewhat', 'muddled', 'nature', 'narrative', 'movie', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'denying', 'reality', 'especially', 'when', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'involve', 'fear', 'governmental', 'retaliation', 'guilt', 'having', 'stood', 'allowing', 'atrocity', 'happen', 'first', 'place', 'patriotic', 'fervor', 'homeland', 'desire', 'simply', 'abandon', 'past', 'get', 'one', 'life', 'movie', 'places', 'times', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'threat', 'dire', 'circumstances', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'brave', 'people', 'willing', 'put', 'lives', 'line', 'truth', 'justice.This', 'subtle', 'movie', 'own', 'subdued', 'quiet', 'way', 'will', 'worm', 'way', 'very', 'center', 'soul', 'horrifying', 'profoundly', 'moving', 'scene', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'heart', 'conscience', 'staring', 'screen', 'stunned', 'silence']",N/A

1147343,A3FMZ98X1GIYV9,B0014V8IEY,S. McGee,"[7, 10]","This is a haunting film that has stuck with me for weeks since I first saw it; the kind of film that poses important questions without sacrificing the kind of narrative intensity the subject -- the murder of thousands of Polish officers held prisoner of war by the Soviet Union in the early years of World War II -- demands.From the opening shot, when a group of refugees fleeing the invading Germans encounters another group coming from the opposite direction and fleeing from the Soviet Union -- which has taken advantage of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviets to move in and occupy the eastern half of the country -- the stage has been set for the conflict. In the middle are the hapless Poles, with nowhere to turn; their only allies hundreds of miles away in France and England, showing no sign of running to help them. In Krakow, one character, a university professor, is deported to a concentration camp by the Germans; his son, an Army officer, is imprisoned by the Soviets. What is there to choose between them?The story revolves around the choices made by the characters -- to live or to die, to accept historical distortions in the name of surviving and moving forward with their lives or to deny those in the face of horrific consequences. The film deals with a number of characters -- the wife of a general, the wife of the major, their daughters, their extended family, the two sisters of an engineer turned aircraft designer -- and their lives before, during and after the war, as well as that of one who miraculously escaped the carnage of Katyn forest, but becomes a victim of a different kind.Initially, some aspects of the film struck me as slightly propagandistic, not so much in the sense of being anti-Soviet (although that is definitely a major theme) but in the sense of Polish nationalist. Still, I was quickly caught up in the story, thanks to the director's wisdom in noting that it is systems and people who adhere to those systems in a rigid way who are to blame, rather than individuals. While both the Soviets and the Nazis are displayed as despicable, it is a Soviet officer who performs a remarkable service for one of the army officer's wives early on in the story.What is truth, and to what extent will people insist on their right to the truth when the price to be paid is nearly total -- freedom, peace of mind, friendship, etc.? Do we owe a greater loyalty to those who are dead, or to ourselves when they are gone and we can no longer do anything for them? Few films have the guts to tackle such complex issues and to do so in an honest fashion. Some of the answers -- as portrayed in the film, at least -- may be idealistic and even a bit unlikely, but such is the grip of the film that this didn't even occur to me until days later, and even then didn't cause me to question my impression of the film.We know a lot about the Holocaust, thanks to films such as Schindler's List. This film may be the start of a wider-ranging debate about other kinds of war crimes, which, although they don't measure up to the horrors of the Nazi-designed genocide, should not be forgotten. This is definitely a polemical film, with a strong anti-Soviet/anti-Russian message, but it hews very close to what I know of the history of the period, and the wartime and postwar experience of Poland explains much about the current political state of Central Europe.This is a startling and remarkable film that I'd recommend strongly to anyone with an interest in the period or a taste for cinema (vs Hollywood blockbusters). This isn't a star vehicle; it's an ensemble cast of actors who will be unfamiliar to most in North America, and the story skips quickly from one narrative to the next. It repays the effort. (Some of the subtitles were a bit erratic... but still comprehensible.) The final scenes are among the most chilling I have ever witnessed in my life.",5,"""I choose the murdered; not the murderers""",1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,3907,"['haunting', 'film', 'stuck', 'weeks', 'first', 'saw', 'kind', 'film', 'important', 'questions', 'sacrificing', 'kind', 'narrative', 'intensity', 'subject', 'murder', 'thousands', 'Polish', 'officers', 'held', 'prisoner', 'war', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'early', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'opening', 'shot', 'when', 'group', 'refugees', 'fleeing', 'invading', 'Germans', 'group', 'coming', 'opposite', 'direction', 'fleeing', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'taken', 'advantage', 'non-aggression', 'pact', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Soviets', 'move', 'occupy', 'eastern', 'half', 'country', 'stage', 'been', 'set', 'conflict', 'middle', 'are', 'hapless', 'Poles', 'nowhere', 'turn', 'only', 'allies', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'away', 'France', 'England', 'showing', 'sign', 'running', 'help', 'Krakow', 'one', 'character', 'university', 'professor', 'deported', 'concentration', 'camp', 'Germans', 'son', 'Army', 'officer', 'imprisoned', 'Soviets', 'What', 'there', 'choose', 'story', 'choices', 'made', 'characters', 'live', 'die', 'accept', 'historical', 'distortions', 'name', 'surviving', 'moving', 'forward', 'lives', 'deny', 'face', 'horrific', 'consequences', 'film', 'deals', 'number', 'characters', 'wife', 'general', 'wife', 'major', 'daughters', 'extended', 'family', 'two', 'sisters', 'engineer', 'turned', 'aircraft', 'designer', 'lives', 'war', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'who', 'miraculously', 'escaped', 'carnage', 'Katyn', 'forest', 'victim', 'different', 'kind.Initially', 'aspects', 'film', 'struck', 'slightly', 'propagandistic', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'sense', 'being', 'anti-Soviet', 'definitely', 'major', 'theme', 'sense', 'Polish', 'nationalist', 'Still', 'was', 'quickly', 'caught', 'up', 'story', 'thanks', 'director', 'wisdom', 'noting', 'systems', 'people', 'who', 'adhere', 'systems', 'rigid', 'way', 'who', 'are', 'blame', 'rather', 'individuals', 'Soviets', 'Nazis', 'are', 'displayed', 'despicable', 'Soviet', 'officer', 'who', 'remarkable', 'service', 'one', 'army', 'officer', 'wives', 'early', 'story.What', 'truth', 'what', 'extent', 'will', 'people', 'insist', 'right', 'truth', 'when', 'price', 'be', 'paid', 'nearly', 'total', 'freedom', 'peace', 'mind', 'friendship', 'etc.', 'Do', 'owe', 'greater', 'loyalty', 'who', 'are', 'dead', 'ourselves', 'when', 'are', 'gone', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'do', 'anything', 'Few', 'films', 'have', 'guts', 'tackle', 'such', 'complex', 'issues', 'do', 'so', 'honest', 'fashion', 'answers', 'portrayed', 'film', 'least', 'may', 'be', 'idealistic', 'even', 'bit', 'unlikely', 'such', 'grip', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'occur', 'days', 'later', 'even', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'cause', 'question', 'impression', 'film.We', 'know', 'lot', 'Holocaust', 'thanks', 'films', 'such', 'Schindler', 'List', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'start', 'wider-ranging', 'debate', 'other', 'kinds', 'war', 'crimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'horrors', 'Nazi-designed', 'genocide', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'definitely', 'polemical', 'film', 'strong', 'anti-Soviet/anti-Russian', 'message', 'very', 'close', 'what', 'know', 'history', 'period', 'wartime', 'postwar', 'experience', 'Poland', 'much', 'current', 'political', 'state', 'Central', 'Europe.This', 'startling', 'remarkable', 'film', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'strongly', 'anyone', 'interest', 'period', 'taste', 'cinema', 'vs', 'Hollywood', 'blockbusters', ""n't"", 'star', 'vehicle', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'actors', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'unfamiliar', 'most', 'North', 'America', 'story', 'skips', 'quickly', 'one', 'narrative', 'next', 'effort', 'subtitles', 'were', 'bit', 'erratic', 'still', 'comprehensible', 'final', 'scenes', 'are', 'most', 'chilling', 'have', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'life']",N/A

1147345,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B0014V8IEY,The Guardian,"[4, 4]","Poland's tragedy is that it was caught in the middle of the 20th century between a paranoid and ideologically ruthless Soviet Union to the east and Nazi Germany to the west, invaded and occupied in turn by both. The Stalinist regime was in one way even more ruthless than the Nazis, who whatever their other murderous excesses did treat the majority of Polish military POWs at the end of the September 1939 war in line with the Geneva Convention. The Soviet regime, in contrast, secretly murdered 22,000 captured Polish army officers and NCOs and later perpetrated a cynical propaganda campaign to blame the crime on the Nazis. Many of the murdered men were not career soldiers but university professors, teachers, lawyers and other professionals on the military reserve list drafted into service in 1939. All were murdered by the NKVD in April and May 1940 by being shot individually through the back of the head, and most of their bodies were buried in mass graves in the forest near Katyn.Andrzej Wajda's tour-de-force tells the story of the Katyn massacre (some of the victims were murdered at other sites but Katyn was the main location of this monstrous crime) and the subsequent personal and political consequences for the survivors and for Poland. The film is told through a dozen or so characters and is strongly scripted, superbly acted and gripping throughout. The version I saw had the original mainly Polish (but also with some German and Russian) dialogue and was subtitled in English. Shot predominantly in washed-out browns and greens the film has a real period feel and effectively evokes the 1940s when it is set.The film opens in September 1939 on a bridge with a mass of civilians fleeing east away from the invading German armies meeting others fleeing west away from the invading Soviets. We are introduced to three of the main characters: Anna (the truly excellent Maja Ostaszewska) with her young daughter who has travelled with her across half the country from their home in Krakov to the east to find her husband, a Major in the Polish Army (played by the equally excellent Artur Zmijewski) now held prisoner with several thousand officers and NCOs by the invading Soviets. Loosely guarded at this early stage he passes over the chance to flee with his wife and child and chooses to stay with his colleagues from a sense of honour and his oath to the Army. This proves a fateful decision. The officers and NCOs are then removed to Soviet prison camps and Anna is stuck in the new Soviet zone away from her family in Krakov.The narrative develops to juxtapose scenes involving different characters in different parts of Poland and how they cope with the new reality. A compassionate Red Army officer from the occupying force billeted with Anna and her daughter illustrates that the planned Soviet hegemony sees intellectuals as potentially sympathetic to democratic ideals and so dangerous elements to be eliminated.In 1943 the bodies of those massacred at Katyn are uncovered by the Nazis who by then occupy the whole of Poland and half of Russia. The propaganda opportunities are enthusiastically seized on and film of the exhumed bodies is shown to paint the Soviets as ruthless murdering Bolsheviks and the heroic German soldier as noble crusader against Communist-Jewish tyranny. This factual episode from history is used as a turning point in the film for most of the characters.Nothing is black-and-white: some of the characters are pragmatic (cynical? Self-serving?), some stand up for the truth as they know it and put themselves on the line (foolish? Futile heroics?) The film is even-handed: people face difficult choices according to circumstance and are not judged, but understood.Wajda saves the real killer scene for the final reel, and the screen then goes dark with only sombre music.Due to the international political situation, the cold war and the passage of time, no-one was ever brought to book for the crime. The perpetrators, and those who gave the order, were long dead by the time the truth emerged.Despite the grim and serious subject matter I would recommend `Katyn' unreservedly.

Trapped between the two great homicidal idealogies of the 20th century...if not world history......Poland was murdered. This film is the story of her burial.Beginning with the Communist invasion and using a collection of fictional characters, the film covers the period of the Nazi/Communist Alliance as they worked hand in hand to destroy the Polish people then through the period when the two regimes turned on each other and finally the immediate post-war period where, though the rest of the world saw liberation, Poland (and Eastern Europe) were condenmed to what appeared to be an eternal night under Communist.The film's primary......and that which serves symbolically as the fate of the country as a whole.......is the Katyn massacre.  After the Communist invasion was complete in 1939, Joseph Stalin ordered the entire Polish officer corp....... which constituted the country's professional elite and thus its only hope of someday regaining her freedom........to be exterminated. Thus they were shipped in boxcars to the Katyn forest near Smolesk and all 22,000 of the them were murdered and buried in mass graves.  The film begins and ends with this atrocious crime as family members struggle to discover what happened to their loved ones and then have to deal with the Communist govt attempts to blame it on the Germans with fatal consequences for those who speak the truth.An extremley good.....if wildly depressing film that fulfills my personal dictate for any new film about the Second World War.......namely it be about something that has NEVER been done before and this film is certainly that.  To the best of the my knowledge there has never been a film about Katyn, the Soviet Invasion of Poland nor that shows the alliance between the National Socialists and the Communists in such detail before. The film is very good at making the point that there was not any difference between the two at all.  This is only the third film that I am aware of (besides the Russian THE CHEKIST and the Ukrainian FAMINE-33) that dramatizes the Communist genocide.  This is the first film.....probably since the war period itself.......that points out how Christians......specifically Catholics........were persecuted and frequently murdered simply for being Christians and the film is a bracing tonic to the increasingly virulently anti-Christian Western Media and shows the logical end result of such hatred and attitudes.The film suffers slightly....in my opinion..........during the post-war section when a group of heretofore unknown characters show up.  They are young people who grew up during the war and are Poland's last hope.  Their fates are intended....and do...show that under communism....Poland will suffer endless ""Little Katyns"" to keep the country down but their appearance is disorienting as the viewer is distracted wondering ""Am I supposed to know these people? Did I miss something??"" A minor point but a valid one.In way, this is not really a WW2 movie but rather a Cold War film as the War and Katyn are not the end but rather the beginning and the end is when Poland is finally buried under a mound of Communist dirt and there is only darkness.As per the respect the film has for the victims of Katyn and the material, there are no graphic sex scenes, cool CGI moments, obscene language and the violence is what it is. No more. No less. The film is slightly retro in style and certainly in content. At times, it feels like something that might have been made in the late forties. At other time, the middle Sixties.  A consistently moving and intelligent film. Heavy stuff. Good history.  We will be in our graves a long time before Hollywood ever makes anything like it.Recommended.NOT recommended however for liberals who would not understand why the scenes of Catholic cemeteries being desecrated, priests being arrested and Catholics being mass murdered are being presented as negatives and consistently wanting to laugh and cheer--and probably do-- at those scenes would not find themselves in rhythm with the film's tone and intent.",4,A Brave Film about the Red Holocaust,1275350400,"06 1, 2010",2010,4344,"['KATYN', '2007', 'Written', 'Directed', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda.While', 'everybody', '.or', 'should', 'know', 'September', '1', '1939', 'National', 'Socialist', 'Germany', 'invaded', 'Poland', 'what', 'very', 'few', 'know', 'should..is', 'September', '17', 'Germany', 'ally', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'invaded', 'East', 'Trapped', 'two', 'great', 'homicidal', 'idealogies', '20th', 'century', 'not', 'world', 'history', 'Poland', 'was', 'murdered', 'film', 'story', 'burial.Beginning', 'Communist', 'invasion', 'using', 'collection', 'fictional', 'characters', 'film', 'period', 'Nazi/Communist', 'Alliance', 'worked', 'hand', 'hand', 'destroy', 'Polish', 'people', 'then', 'period', 'when', 'two', 'regimes', 'turned', 'other', 'finally', 'immediate', 'post-war', 'period', 'where', 'rest', 'world', 'saw', 'liberation', 'Poland', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'were', 'condenmed', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'eternal', 'night', 'Communist.The', 'film', 'primary', 'symbolically', 'fate', 'country', 'whole', 'Katyn', 'massacre', 'Communist', 'invasion', 'was', 'complete', '1939', 'Joseph', 'Stalin', 'ordered', 'entire', 'Polish', 'officer', 'corp', 'constituted', 'country', 'professional', 'elite', 'thus', 'only', 'hope', 'someday', 'regaining', 'freedom', '..to', 'be', 'exterminated', 'Thus', 'were', 'shipped', 'boxcars', 'Katyn', 'forest', 'Smolesk', '22,000', 'were', 'murdered', 'buried', 'mass', 'graves', 'film', 'atrocious', 'crime', 'family', 'members', 'struggle', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'loved', 'ones', 'then', 'have', 'deal', 'Communist', 'govt', 'attempts', 'blame', 'Germans', 'fatal', 'consequences', 'who', 'speak', 'truth.An', 'extremley', 'good', '..if', 'wildly', 'depressing', 'film', 'personal', 'dictate', 'new', 'film', 'Second', 'World', 'War', '.namely', 'be', 'something', 'NEVER', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'film', 'certainly', 'that', 'best', 'knowledge', 'there', 'never', 'been', 'film', 'Katyn', 'Soviet', 'Invasion', 'Poland', 'alliance', 'National', 'Socialists', 'Communists', 'such', 'detail', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'making', 'point', 'was', 'not', 'difference', 'two', 'only', 'third', 'film', 'am', 'aware', 'Russian', 'THE', 'CHEKIST', 'Ukrainian', 'FAMINE-33', 'Communist', 'genocide', 'first', 'film', '..probably', 'war', 'period', 'out', 'how', 'Christians', 'specifically', 'Catholics', '..were', 'persecuted', 'frequently', 'murdered', 'simply', 'being', 'Christians', 'film', 'bracing', 'tonic', 'increasingly', 'virulently', 'anti-Christian', 'Western', 'Media', 'logical', 'end', 'result', 'such', 'hatred', 'attitudes.The', 'film', 'suffers', 'slightly', '.in', 'opinion', '.during', 'post-war', 'section', 'when', 'group', 'heretofore', 'unknown', 'characters', 'show', 'up', 'are', 'young', 'people', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'war', 'are', 'Poland', 'last', 'hope', 'fates', 'are', 'intended', '.and', 'do', 'show', 'communism', '.Poland', 'will', 'suffer', 'endless', 'Little', 'Katyns', 'keep', 'country', 'down', 'appearance', 'disorienting', 'viewer', 'distracted', 'wondering', 'Am', 'supposed', 'know', 'people', 'Did', 'miss', 'something', 'minor', 'point', 'valid', 'one.In', 'way', 'not', 'really', 'WW2', 'movie', 'rather', 'Cold', 'War', 'film', 'War', 'Katyn', 'are', 'not', 'end', 'rather', 'beginning', 'end', 'when', 'Poland', 'finally', 'buried', 'mound', 'Communist', 'dirt', 'only', 'darkness.As', 'respect', 'film', 'victims', 'Katyn', 'material', 'are', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'cool', 'CGI', 'moments', 'obscene', 'language', 'violence', 'what', 'more', 'less', 'film', 'slightly', 'retro', 'style', 'certainly', 'content', 'times', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'late', 'forties', 'other', 'time', 'middle', 'Sixties', 'consistently', 'moving', 'intelligent', 'film', 'Heavy', 'stuff', 'Good', 'history', 'will', 'be', 'graves', 'long', 'time', 'Hollywood', 'ever', 'anything', 'it.Recommended.NOT', 'recommended', 'however', 'liberals', 'who', 'would', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'scenes', 'Catholic', 'cemeteries', 'being', 'desecrated', 'priests', 'being', 'arrested', 'Catholics', 'being', 'mass', 'murdered', 'are', 'being', 'presented', 'negatives', 'consistently', 'wanting', 'laugh', 'cheer', 'probably', 'do', 'scenes', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'rhythm', 'film', 'tone', 'intent']",N/A

Poland was not the first to bear the brunt of the Nazi invasions, as Czechoslovakia rightfully claims the status as the first nation to be violated. However, Poland bore a much more thorough burden of suffering than other occupied nations. Brutalized by TWO oppressors, Poland would not be free again, until fifty years later.Many people are ignorant of the fact that the Soviet Union thoroughly assisted Nazi Germany in the invasion of Poland in 1939. Here we have the true story of a Polish lady, the wife of a prominent army officer. She saw her husband for the last time, in the early days of WWII, as he was about to be shipped off to a Soviet P.O.W. camp. She never saw him again.Years pass, the war finally ends, the Soviet Union enslaves all of Eastern Europe as vassal states, and still there is no news as to the fate of her husband.

Be prepared for one long, graphic scene that depicts most cruel and brutal atrocities committed there. That everything was done in such a methodical way makes the already shocking subject matter more horrifying.But ""Katyn"" (directed by Wajda who lost his father at Katyn) is also about those who are left behind, especially women: wives and mothers of the officers who disappeared into the forest forever. They do not merely have to wait in fearful anticipation; they also have to fight their own fight, even after the war is over, in the society where the authorities cover up the truths about Katyn.There are a few too many characters in the complex story, and some sub-plots look unnecessary to me, but those who are more versed in the Polish history might feel otherwise. Most actors did a great job and among them two are standout - Maja Ostaszewska as Anna who believes her missing husband Andrzej is alive, and Andrzej Chyra as Lt. Jerzy who plays an important role when Anna finally knows about the truth about Andrzei and other officers.My only complaint is that the film is too short. Wajda attempts to encompass so many episodes (well-told and emotionally intense as they are) in a two-hour film, and he even weaves real footage into his fictional drama part. You need more time to fully describe the far reaching tragedy and those who have been deeply affected by it.

Well, for a while, the movie shows the Polish officers languishing in captivity right up to April, 1940, but their fate remains a mystery for most of the rest of the movie, when the next scenes take place right after the discovery of the mass graves in 1943, and then right after the Russian armies occupied Poland in 1945. You see a lot of the relatives of the missing men as they mourn their loved ones, and some get bitter when the Soviet propaganda films announce about the Germans committing this massacre of 20,000 Polish officers in the summer of 1941, as opposed to the truth about the massacre in April, 1940. For a while, I thought, ""What the hell? Everyone in this movie are all talking about Katyn, but you don't show us exactly WHAT happened to those Polish officers!""Then right after you see a girl arrested by the secret police in Communist Poland after daring to make a tombstone for her missing brother announcing his death at Katyn on April 10, 1940, the truth is revealed by the recovered entries of her brother's diary, and the last scenes of the movie show the Polish officers then being herded off the train and into buses with blacked-out windows as they're driven deep into a forest about 10 kilometers from Smolensk in western Russia. Then the scenes show the execution of a high-ranking Polish general and other prominent officers deep in some kind of building, where the Soviets throw a fresh bucket of water on the floor to wash away the blood of the murdered men, and the bodies are dumped onto trucks. The rest are herded off the vehicles right up to the burial pits and are murdered with a single bullet through the head, some of them saying their last prayers and holding rosaries at the last moments. A single Soviet soldier lingers in the pit of perhaps hundreds of fallen officers, bayoneting anyone who still might be alive right as a bulldozer piles up mounds of dirt into the graves to cover up their crimes. It is the last scene of the entire movie.The Germans had it right when they discovered these mass graves in 1943, just months before the advancing Soviet armies would take control of the site, and announcing these atrocities to be the fault of the Russians, but we refused to believe them, as the Russians happened to be our ""ally."" Even when the truth was uncovered, it stayed hidden for years. I have the greatest sympathy for Poland, which had been denied their independence by the Russians and Germans since 1772, and then only given a taste of freedom from 1918 to 1939 before that light was extinguished by the invading Germans and then by the Soviets from 1945 until 1989.

Horror can never be ""good"".Everybody knew - since the 1940s - that the of Katyn's perpetrators spoke Russian, but it was silenced because the Soviets were the ""good guys"", the ""allies"". And the only one that raised his voice to accuse Moscow, Vladislav Sikorski, had his plane conveniently brought down by ""technical failure"".The NKVD henchmen that participated in the massacre (just 20 to 30 agents) knowing the number of executions that they would have to perform (250 per night) for their boss, Lavrenti Beria, asked for German PPK pistols, because their recoil was less painful to their wrists than the heavy Nagant revolver, and because their Tokarev TT-30 was unreliable for the heavy use intended. Besides, the use of German weapons added plausible deniability in case of exhumation of corpses (it seems they could read the future!). The chief NKVD executioner, Vasili Blokhin, a favorite psychopath of Beria, all clad in black leather, is rumored to have killed  - personally - 7.000 of the 22.0000 prisoners. Blokhin and his henchmen ""worked"" for 10 straight hours, giving us an average of 1 murder every 3 minutes. The blood bath prolonged with cold efficiency (NKVD had a lot of practice since the 1930s purges) for 28 days of April 1940.That's the real dimension of the horror of Katyn.And this is only an example of the bigger horror that had visited Russia, Ukraine, the Caucasus, the Baltic republics since 1918.

Polish Director Andrzej Pajda does an excellent job of putting fictional clothes on an atrocious, factual event that was almost lost to history.Its the story of a little known genocide (22,000 slaughtered) that took place during WWII in Katyn Forest. Its the story of how war tears apart families and compromises allegiances.  Its the story of a country's occupation by foreign invaders and its national resistance toward that oppressor.  Finally, its the story of crimes against humanity and the lingering effects on those left behind to mourn their loss.Pajda was so adept at weaving together the warring threads of three countries (Poland, Germany and Russia) that viewers might find themselves peeking between the soldier's seams to determine who's wearing the uniform. The Politics and Propoganda become apparently real as the movie comes to an unforgettably emotional climax.  I was also impressed by the subtle linkage of one family's story with that of another family. I didn't expect to make sense of some things I saw early in the movie, only to have their meanings illuminated later. The power of an Excellent film!The DVD Extra which shows an interview with Director Andrzej Wajda is priceless. Here's what he had to say on the importance of education and developing one's self:""Developing one's self through one's interests or work, making movies, creating an identity, the fact that one searches for people who think alike, is dangerous to any authority because authority always wants subjugation; to agree to everything. It wants an easy society.""On Patriotism: ""Those who preach it the most, are the least suitable for it.  They have the least, so to say, heart, courage, and judgment to take advantage when the time is ripe.""",5,"See The Crime, The Lie, The Life",1315094400,"09 4, 2011",2011,1846,"['movie', 'nothing', 'short', 'excellent', 'look', 'language', 'lessons', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'Polish', 'Director', 'Andrzej', 'Pajda', 'excellent', 'job', 'putting', 'fictional', 'clothes', 'atrocious', 'factual', 'event', 'was', 'almost', 'lost', 'history.Its', 'story', 'little', 'known', 'genocide', '22,000', 'slaughtered', 'took', 'place', 'WWII', 'Katyn', 'Forest', 'story', 'how', 'war', 'apart', 'families', 'compromises', 'allegiances', 'story', 'country', 'occupation', 'foreign', 'invaders', 'national', 'resistance', 'oppressor', 'Finally', 'story', 'crimes', 'humanity', 'lingering', 'effects', 'left', 'mourn', 'loss.Pajda', 'was', 'so', 'adept', 'weaving', 'together', 'warring', 'threads', 'three', 'countries', 'Poland', 'Germany', 'Russia', 'viewers', 'might', 'find', 'peeking', 'soldier', 'seams', 'determine', 'who', 'wearing', 'uniform', 'Politics', 'Propoganda', 'become', 'apparently', 'real', 'movie', 'unforgettably', 'emotional', 'climax', 'was', 'also', 'impressed', 'subtle', 'linkage', 'one', 'family', 'story', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'make', 'sense', 'things', 'saw', 'early', 'movie', 'only', 'have', 'meanings', 'illuminated', 'later', 'power', 'Excellent', 'film', 'DVD', 'Extra', 'interview', 'Director', 'Andrzej', 'Wajda', 'priceless', 'Here', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'importance', 'education', 'developing', 'one', 'self', 'Developing', 'one', 'one', 'interests', 'work', 'making', 'movies', 'creating', 'identity', 'fact', 'one', 'searches', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'alike', 'dangerous', 'authority', 'authority', 'always', 'subjugation', 'agree', 'everything', 'easy', 'society', 'Patriotism', 'who', 'preach', 'most', 'are', 'least', 'suitable', 'have', 'least', 'so', 'say', 'heart', 'courage', 'judgment', 'take', 'advantage', 'when', 'time', 'ripe']",N/A

It is a compelling account of the Katyn massacre of 1940, where the Soviet NKVD, under Stalin's orders, murdered more than 20,000 Polish officers, educators, and various intellectuals. The movie is a cinematic triumph, masterfully directed by Andrej Wajda, whose own father was a victim of the massacre.The movie itself plays out in three parts - the first focuses on the events in the early days of the war in 1939. Polish citizens are portrayed fleeing from the Germans on one side and the Russians on the other, meeting somewhere in the middle and not knowing where to go, as either way spells danger and doom. In the fracas, there is a mother and her young daughter who are looking for the husband and father, a cavalry captain in the Polish army. When they eventually find him, he refuses to leave with them, citing his loyalty to his fellow officers and the army. Time passes, and these Polish officers find themselves incarcerated by the Russians, awaiting an unknown fate. Later, the Germans reveal the horrors of Katyn, blaming the Russians and using it as propaganda in favor of their war efforts. The second part of the movie is about what happens after the war - Poland is under a new government, loyal to the Soviets [more of a puppet government] and Katyn is blamed on the Germans, though witnesses, family members of the murdered and those who do not buy into the new establishment know differently - the truth of Katyn, i.e. that the murders were committed by the Soviets. Yet, those who oppose find themselves in grave peril, as one notable character in the movie says ""I choose to be with the murdered, and not the murderers."" A choice that carries a high price indeed.The final part is the most tragic as it follows the doomed on their journey towards death and the murder pits which are to be their graves. These scenes are harrowing to say the least, and the director does an excellent job in capturing the bewilderment,incredulity, and dawning horror on the faces of the condemned men. This is one of the most compelling WW II movies I've ever seen, which is saying a lot since I have watched many, especially those dealing with the Holocaust. It has been a long time coming, since not many movies have been made about this horrifying and tragic incident in history and I believe Andrej Wajda's ""Katyn"" is destined to become a classic.",5,Compelling and absorbing movie about the truth of the Katyn massacre in WW II,1251158400,"08 25, 2009",2009,2449,"['first', 'frame', 'till', 'poignant', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'shall', 'not', 'soon', 'forget', 'compelling', 'account', 'Katyn', 'massacre', '1940', 'where', 'Soviet', 'NKVD', 'Stalin', 'orders', 'murdered', 'more', '20,000', 'Polish', 'officers', 'educators', 'various', 'intellectuals', 'movie', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'masterfully', 'directed', 'Andrej', 'Wajda', 'own', 'father', 'was', 'victim', 'massacre.The', 'movie', 'out', 'three', 'parts', 'first', 'events', 'early', 'days', 'war', '1939', 'Polish', 'citizens', 'are', 'portrayed', 'fleeing', 'Germans', 'one', 'side', 'Russians', 'other', 'meeting', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'go', 'way', 'danger', 'doom', 'fracas', 'mother', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'husband', 'father', 'cavalry', 'captain', 'Polish', 'army', 'When', 'eventually', 'find', 'leave', 'citing', 'loyalty', 'fellow', 'officers', 'army', 'Time', 'Polish', 'officers', 'find', 'incarcerated', 'Russians', 'awaiting', 'unknown', 'fate', 'Later', 'Germans', 'reveal', 'horrors', 'Katyn', 'blaming', 'Russians', 'using', 'propaganda', 'favor', 'war', 'efforts', 'second', 'part', 'movie', 'what', 'war', 'Poland', 'new', 'government', 'loyal', 'Soviets', '[', 'more', 'puppet', 'government', ']', 'Katyn', 'blamed', 'Germans', 'witnesses', 'family', 'members', 'murdered', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'buy', 'new', 'establishment', 'know', 'differently', 'truth', 'Katyn', 'i.e', 'murders', 'were', 'committed', 'Soviets', 'who', 'oppose', 'find', 'grave', 'peril', 'one', 'notable', 'character', 'movie', 'choose', 'be', 'murdered', 'not', 'murderers', 'choice', 'high', 'price', 'indeed.The', 'final', 'part', 'most', 'tragic', 'doomed', 'journey', 'towards', 'death', 'murder', 'pits', 'are', 'be', 'graves', 'scenes', 'are', 'harrowing', 'say', 'least', 'director', 'excellent', 'job', 'capturing', 'bewilderment', 'incredulity', 'dawning', 'horror', 'condemned', 'men', 'one', 'most', 'compelling', 'WW', 'II', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'saying', 'lot', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'especially', 'dealing', 'Holocaust', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'coming', 'not', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'horrifying', 'tragic', 'incident', 'history', 'believe', 'Andrej', 'Wajda', 'Katyn', 'destined', 'become', 'classic']",N/A
