A dude out of the slammer is unwillingly caught up in his old trade of auto theft. In the down time, he creates welded sculpture from junked autos. An art dealer (Rebecca Romijn) sees his work and sells it for a bundle of money without his knowledge. He prospers and a plot twist allows him to go straight. Nice action with great parallels between modern art dealers and used auto salesmen. Not an intellectual stretch, but fun. A totally different film, but with the same philosophical outlook is (untitled).",4,"Nice comment on modern art, Fun to watch.",1383782400,"11 7, 2013",2013,568,"['Modern', 'art', 'worth', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'pay', 'dude', 'slammer', 'unwillingly', 'caught', 'up', 'old', 'trade', 'auto', 'theft', 'down', 'time', 'welded', 'sculpture', 'junked', 'autos', 'art', 'dealer', 'Rebecca', 'Romijn', 'work', 'bundle', 'money', 'knowledge', 'plot', 'twist', 'go', 'straight', 'Nice', 'action', 'great', 'parallels', 'modern', 'art', 'dealers', 'used', 'auto', 'salesmen', 'Not', 'intellectual', 'stretch', 'fun', 'totally', 'different', 'film', 'same', 'philosophical', 'outlook', 'untitled']",Con Artist
1427453,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004SK8528,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","When approaching a direct-to-DVD thriller, it's best to have limited expectations. Sometimes you may be pleasantly surprised, and sometimes you discover a film much more inept than you had anticipated. In the case of ""The Con Artist,"" I found the title to be the cleverest thing about the film. You see, the titular lead is both an ex-convict and an aspiring sculptor--a literal con artist. However, with such a name, one might also expect a tidy and twisty film dealing with double-crosses and schemes. In the strictest sense, ""The Con Artist"" has nothing to do with that other definition of con. In fact, it straddles its time between an elite art milieu and a low level criminal enterprise while being completely unconvincing in both environments. Billed as a hip comedy, however, most of the chuckles provided were of a completely unintentional nature. I guess I must not be hip enough!Perhaps the biggest draw of the film is to see Donald Sutherland pair off with his son Rossif. The younger Sutherland plays the lead character who begins the movie being released from prison. Wanting to start life afresh, he gets drawn back into illegal activity by his former crime boss (the elder Sutherland). Apparently and inexplicably successful, this band of inept hooligans seem to make most of their money on stealing cars. But for this to be a major plot point, you'll be amazed at the junky mid-range cars that qualify as theft-worthy! Any actual criminal activity documented is patently ridiculous. I especially loved the trick where they gummed some sort of money to the asphalt in a vacant lot, waited for a driver to come by and notice it, and when he got completely out of the car--they snuck up behind him to drive off in the vehicle. Genius! Criminal masterminds!But that's not the worst of it, our young hero also has a thoroughly unbelievable accident with a successful gallery owner played by Rebecca Romijn. (Off topic, and back to cars, why does she drive a dilapidated muscle car if she's a hotshot in the art world? Oh well.) She sees the one sculpture he has made and is convinced of his genius. Soon he's off to preposterous gallery shows and exhibits as well as swanky parties--and none of these sets is the least bit believable as upscale. The only art collector showcased is and over-the-top Greg Germann playing a walking cliche. His piece sells to Germann who commissions another one, and before you know it--the con artist has the central spot in an upcoming influential show (even though he has no other art and he is unaware of it a week prior to the event) as well as the cover article in a local paper (again, he's completely unaware of it--must be a great piece)!It's all silly enough as our young hero is torn between both worlds as well as a strangely antiseptic romance. Of course, you know these separate lives will converge for a big finale. But those waiting for the film to redeem itself with an exciting conclusion will again be left scratching their heads at how many lapses of logic were necessary to pull this unsatisfying story to a close. SPOILER ALERT!!! The thrilling conclusion and epic final crime is to steal about six cars from a valet service. I usually don't like to reveal major plot spoilers, but this one was priceless in how absolutely underwhelming it was. All in all, I can't recommend the film (although I liked Romijn's go-for-broke zeal). Rossif Sutherland has potential, but I'd suggest he doesn't lead with this on his resume.

Donald plays the crime boss, Romijin the art gallery cougar,  and everyone else chimes in on standard supporting roles. But Germann took the cake at providing the worst overacting in the film as a flamboyant art buyer, to such a point it was funny how bad he would get.The picture quality is average to horrible a few times (including washouts and bad focusing). The sound is off in a few sequences, but the worst mixing is during the sex scene with Romijin (she was horribly faking it and the voiceover moaning and screaming sounded like they were remixing a bad 70s skin flick - even though nothing gets shown here).A commentary for an extra, English with subs in same.

Caught between being an artist and a thief Vince has to decide what life he prefers.  This was actually a pretty decent movie, but it did tend to drag in parts and the love story aspect of it seemed unnecessary for the most part.  There is not much new in this movie that has not been in hundreds of other movies, the big heist is pretty much a direct rip off of ""Gone in 60 seconds"".  It's not bad but after that movie or ""Italian Job"" or the Oceans movies this one is a re-hash but not as good.  Overall not a bad movie, but nothing you haven't seen before.
