It is quite blatantly just trying to cash in on the hype behind ""300"", evident by the filming style and perpetual sunset-esque backdrop.Kudos to it keeping to history, although it does get wrong several aspects of the battle, and the Spartan nature for soft-spokenness.  The documentary claims ""it's not in the Spartans' nature to be silent"" during battle.  This is completely wrong; even Steven Pressfield, author on two historical fiction books on the Spartans, and contributing interviewee on this documentary, claims that silence on the field of battle was what made the Spartans particularly intimidating.Other than that, it's something of a good attempt, but ultimately inferior to better documentaries already released, and the re-enactments looks very poor due to their attempt to bank on 300's comic-book style.",2,Banking on that movie.

If the beurocrats in Brussels truly want to forge a common sense of European identity then perhaps they should ensure that every schoolchild on the continent is at least aware of the story.Sadly, the battle isn't really as well known as it should be, or at least wasn't until the blockbuster '300' came out last year.  And here we have an American made documentary to companion that film, sticking fairly closely to the events as depicted there (and astonishingly as the events are widely agreed to have actually happened).  In contrast to what other reviewers have written, I didn't find this to be particularly low budget.  True, talking heads take up much of the time, often stating the merely banal and obvious, but the recreated scenes are effective if brief.  In fact, they are so similar in style to the film that I'm sure a lot of the same extras and production team were involved.Its such an astonishing story that its hard to tell badly and this documentary does quite a sound job.  I'm far from an expert on Ancient Greece but I was suprised at the historians seemingly claiming that the battle of Thermopylae caused the birth of a collective sense of Greek identity which led directly to a united Greece under Phillip II and then the glory of Alexander's empire.  Hmmm...I thought the subsequent war between Sparta and Athens (the peloponnesian) left all of Greece easy prey for the Macedonians (who for hundreds of years had never been allowed to participate in the Olympic Games because they were not seen as sharing in the common Greek cultural identity).That quibble aside, a well made and effective retelling of an incredible story that everybody should know.",4,Sound and effective retelling of an amazing story,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",2008,1807,"['battle', 'Thermopylae', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'decisive', 'battles', 'world', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'one', 'most', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'beurocrats', 'Brussels', 'truly', 'want', 'forge', 'common', 'sense', 'European', 'identity', 'then', 'perhaps', 'should', 'ensure', 'schoolchild', 'continent', 'least', 'aware', 'story.Sadly', 'battle', ""n't"", 'really', 'as', 'well', 'known', 'should', 'be', 'least', 'was', ""n't"", 'blockbuster', 'came', 'last', 'year', 'here', 'have', 'American', 'made', 'documentary', 'companion', 'film', 'sticking', 'fairly', 'closely', 'events', 'depicted', 'astonishingly', 'events', 'are', 'widely', 'agreed', 'have', 'actually', 'happened', 'contrast', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'written', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'particularly', 'low', 'budget', 'True', 'talking', 'heads', 'take', 'up', 'much', 'time', 'often', 'stating', 'merely', 'banal', 'obvious', 'recreated', 'scenes', 'are', 'effective', 'brief', 'fact', 'are', 'so', 'similar', 'style', 'film', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'same', 'extras', 'production', 'team', 'were', 'involved.Its', 'such', 'astonishing', 'story', 'hard', 'tell', 'badly', 'documentary', 'quite', 'sound', 'job', ""'m"", 'far', 'expert', 'Ancient', 'Greece', 'was', 'suprised', 'historians', 'seemingly', 'claiming', 'battle', 'Thermopylae', 'caused', 'birth', 'collective', 'sense', 'Greek', 'identity', 'led', 'directly', 'united', 'Greece', 'Phillip', 'II', 'then', 'glory', 'Alexander', 'empire', 'Hmmm', 'thought', 'subsequent', 'war', 'Sparta', 'Athens', 'peloponnesian', 'left', 'Greece', 'easy', 'prey', 'Macedonians', 'who', 'hundreds', 'years', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'allowed', 'participate', 'Olympic', 'Games', 'were', 'not', 'seen', 'sharing', 'common', 'Greek', 'cultural', 'identity', 'quibble', 'aside', 'well', 'made', 'effective', 'retelling', 'incredible', 'story', 'everybody', 'should', 'know']",Last Stand of the 300: The Legendary Battle at Thermopylae

This video is remarkably true to Herodotus' description, and avoids the glamorization typical of Hollywood's treatment of the subject. It treats both the Greeks and Persians fairly, and provides an integrated view of both the land and sea battles and the related battles of Marathon and Salamis, which had previously been confused in my mind.Unfortunately, the battle of Salamis and Themistocles' role is given rather short shrift. A fuller description is provided on the first disk ofThe History Channel Presents Engineering an Empire - The Complete Series (Collector's Edition), which appears to have originally been part of this disk.Because the topography around Thermopylae has changed significantly over the past 2500 years, the film relies heavily on graphic representations of the battle, which helps clarify it in the eyes of the viewer. To the extent that actors are used, they look like Greeks and Persians -- dark, swarthy looks, and not inordinately handsome. There is, in the words of Hollywood, no ""love interest.""

The film also discusses the seaborne aspects of the campaign, which were at least as important as the Spartans and their stand at the pass.

Consider watching ""300"" for light entertainment, but if you want the facts about the battle, this is the DVD to buy.  The History Channel has put together a roster of experts who walk the viewer through the events that led up to the battle beginning decades earlier.  This includes events such as the Battle of Marathon and other battles that helped lead to full-scale war and the battle at Thermopylae.  There is also good background information on the formation of the Athenian navy and extensive analysis and discussion about how critical the naval battle was in addition to the work done by the Spartans.  The naval battles alone make for a quite an interesting story.A good summary of Spartan culture is also put forth and is more even handed than it is worshipful. The truth is that there were aspects of Spartan culture that we would find noble and others that we would find quite distasteful. I appreciate that both were presented here to offer a true picture rather than the myth that Hollywood puts forth.""Last Stand of the 300"" moves along at a good pace, is informative, and interesting.

With a concentration on the battle itself, and to the History Channel's credit, a significant amount of the 91 minute documentary is spent discussing the Spartan philosophy and way of life in contrast to the other Greek city states and the political rivalies they shared.Considerable air time is also devoted to the weapons and armor used by the Persians and the Greeks as well as the naval battles and the tactical expertise that allowed the Greeks to stave off Xerxes and the Persian army--said to be over 300,000 strong--against a force of about 1,500 men; roughly the legendary 300 Spartans themselves, and a loose confederation of other soldiers from other city states.

You'll have a good basic knowledge of these events after watching this DVD.  There are some minor inaccuracies in the documentary but they aren't significant.  My problem with this DVD is that the 700 warriors of Thespiae who stayed to the very end with the Spartans don't rate a mention.  Thespiae is a part of Boeotia in central Greece.  It lost every male citizen at Thermopylae compared with Spartan's 4%.  The Persians destroyed Thespiae for good measure.  Citizens of Thespiae weren't trained in an agoge type system where military skill is honed or indoctrinated since childhood.  Because of that I think they were much braver than the 300 Spartans.

1064600,A30YS8Z43O1YY3,B000OIOPPE,RJRo20,"[70, 73]","The History Channel has presented a mixed of bad and good documentaries, but the ""Last Stand of the 300"" is definitely one of the best that they've ever produced! I wholeheartedly agree with previous reviewers that this is an excellent and well-researched documentary about the Battle of Thermopylae--one of history's most famous last stands of all-time.The overall presentation of this epic battle is superb. Great visuals, music, dramatic reenactments, and knowledgeable scholars provide a very enlightening and fascinating account of the events preceding and following the 3-day battle at Thermopylae. The battle itself is examined and analyzed in meticulous detail--military tactics and strategies discussed from both sides of the war (land and sea).As reviewer, Raffaele Vardavas mentioned, this documentary does resemble a little like the movie ""300,"" which gives it a more appealing and cinematic look. The fighting sequences--especially during the last stand--are wonderfully depicted.The performance of the 300 Spartans--and approximately 700 Thespian soldiers and unremembered 900 Helots (Spartan slaves)--has been hailed as an outstanding example of courage against insurmountable odds. Among the Greeks, the Spartan defenders were the 'bravest of the brave' and their enormous sacrifice helped saved the future of Greece and unknowningly ""altered the course of Western civilization."" As one of the world's greatest and most symbolic events in history, this DVD is a must-have for all!(Note: I have the PBS DVD ofThe Spartans, and also think this one is NOT as exciting to watch. Instead, the PBS presentation feels like a tedious 3-hour lecture in a history class. ""Last Stand...300"" is way better!!!

1064601,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,B000OIOPPE,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[30, 42]","After only one viewing, I can't even begin to compile a list of the numerous factual errors and slapdash invention that characterize the tedious and shallow ""Last Stand of the 300.""  I was wary going in of the baleful influence of the shamefully dumb ""300"" movie, and this History Channel (tsk-tsk) production painfully lived down to expectations.There's little point to belabor the obvious -- that this is a tabloid version of history with a LOT of dubious assertions, colored by a movie that was based on a comic book, populated by talking heads I've never heard of (and I have shelves of scholarly books on ancient Greek history) -- except for the ubiquitous Steven Pressfield and he's a FICTION author, for pete's sake -- and garishly illustrated by some  woeful computer graphics  that only add another element of unreality.  (Where was Thermopylae supposed to be, on a fjord in Norway in the middle of winter?  I've never seen a Greek summer portrayed in so many icy blue-grey tones before, and I guess centuries of writers, mapmakers, painters, and photographers never noticed the sheer seaside cliffs of Thermopylae until the makers of ""300"" pointed them out.)  A lot of outrageous allegations are made and accepted without question by the duly deputized historians  -- that ancient Sparta was run like a sadistic US Marine boot camp, based on exaggerated and unsubstantiated tales put out by Roman-era writers centuries after the fact, is a peculiar obsession of Pressfield's, as evidenced in his sadly influential book ""Gates of Fire.""  As if whippings and beatings were the way to forge an unyielding spirit or create the perfect warrior.  Sure, just like kicking your dog repeatedly from puppyhood will produce a loyal and faithful companion.There is a strange tendency here to mangle the pronunciations of Greek-origin words and names; make up stuff when faced with a lack of actual contemporary documentation; and substitute theory for fact without telling the viewer the difference.  Then there are misplaced locations on the maps, wild speculation in place of sober analysis, and worst of all perhaps, a dreadful  modern ideological perspective that puts events and attitudes in words and concepts no ancient Greek would have understood.  We are subjected to a lot of bloviating about ""saving democracy"" when the Greeks had barely invented the word, let alone embarked on a crusade to make the world safe for it.  Your Greek footsoldier at Thermopylae was there because it was his duty to his city, his clan, his gods and his personal honor -- it was not because of high-minded speechifying put into his mouth by late 20th century partisan blowhards. It's ridiculous to ascribe our attitudes  and beliefs to peoples of the distant past, especially when we have so many of the Greeks' OWN thoughts and feelings from this time  preserved in their own histories and literature (mostly ignored, sadly, by these filmmakers).  You won't find any ""we saved democracy!"" talk in these accounts.  Even the notion that the Spartans were somehow ""professionals"" is more than a bit sloppy -- they drew no pay for their service, they were not ""professional"" the way modern mercenaries are ""professional"".  Spartan citizens (homoioi) were a class of landed gentry with no other designated occupation than war, much like medieval knights.  They would have occupied themselves with training, hunting, politicking, and overseeing their estates. They actually spent less time making war than you might expect, conservative Sparta not eager to rock the boat of its stratified society or risk precious and limited manpower wastefully. Spartan citizens formed a more or less permanent standing militia whose training and discipline and organization and internal cohesiveness were leagues beyond what the typical Greek citizen-soldier was capable of; that was the secret of Sparta's battlefield success.Enough.  None of what I've written will sway the impassioned ""300"" fanboys who will insist on rewriting history to suit their own power fantasies;  including producers of cable TV documentaries that cater to such tastes.  For a truly well-made and balanced and engaging documentary on ancient Sparta in all its aspects -- a fascinating society badly served by this one-dimensional, third-rate effort -- I recommend to viewers  ""The Spartans"", 180 minutes,  hosted by Bettany Hughes, produced in the UK and aired and released in the US by PBS.  You can get this through Amazon and it does much better service to the memory of Leonidas and his immortal Three Hundred.",2,Highly skewed and frequently misleading  production,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",2008,4561,"['only', 'one', 'viewing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'compile', 'list', 'numerous', 'factual', 'errors', 'slapdash', 'invention', 'tedious', 'shallow', 'Last', 'Stand', '300', 'was', 'wary', 'going', 'baleful', 'influence', 'shamefully', 'dumb', '300', 'movie', 'History', 'Channel', 'tsk-tsk', 'production', 'painfully', 'lived', 'down', 'expectations.There', 'little', 'point', 'belabor', 'obvious', 'tabloid', 'version', 'history', 'LOT', 'dubious', 'assertions', 'colored', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'populated', 'talking', 'heads', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'have', 'shelves', 'scholarly', 'books', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'history', 'ubiquitous', 'Steven', 'Pressfield', 'FICTION', 'author', 'pete', 'sake', 'garishly', 'illustrated', 'woeful', 'computer', 'graphics', 'only', 'add', 'element', 'unreality', 'Where', 'was', 'Thermopylae', 'supposed', 'be', 'fjord', 'Norway', 'middle', 'winter', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Greek', 'summer', 'portrayed', 'so', 'many', 'icy', 'blue-grey', 'tones', 'guess', 'centuries', 'writers', 'mapmakers', 'painters', 'photographers', 'never', 'noticed', 'sheer', 'seaside', 'cliffs', 'Thermopylae', 'makers', '300', 'pointed', 'out', 'lot', 'outrageous', 'allegations', 'are', 'made', 'accepted', 'question', 'duly', 'deputized', 'historians', 'ancient', 'Sparta', 'was', 'run', 'sadistic', 'US', 'Marine', 'boot', 'camp', 'based', 'exaggerated', 'unsubstantiated', 'tales', 'put', 'out', 'Roman-era', 'writers', 'centuries', 'fact', 'peculiar', 'obsession', 'Pressfield', 'evidenced', 'sadly', 'influential', 'book', 'Gates', 'Fire', 'whippings', 'beatings', 'were', 'way', 'forge', 'unyielding', 'spirit', 'create', 'perfect', 'warrior', 'Sure', 'just', 'kicking', 'dog', 'repeatedly', 'puppyhood', 'will', 'produce', 'loyal', 'faithful', 'companion.There', 'strange', 'tendency', 'here', 'mangle', 'pronunciations', 'Greek-origin', 'words', 'names', 'make', 'up', 'stuff', 'when', 'faced', 'lack', 'actual', 'contemporary', 'documentation', 'substitute', 'theory', 'fact', 'telling', 'viewer', 'difference', 'Then', 'are', 'misplaced', 'locations', 'maps', 'wild', 'speculation', 'place', 'sober', 'analysis', 'worst', 'perhaps', 'dreadful', 'modern', 'ideological', 'perspective', 'events', 'attitudes', 'words', 'ancient', 'Greek', 'would', 'have', 'understood', 'are', 'subjected', 'lot', 'bloviating', 'saving', 'democracy', 'when', 'Greeks', 'had', 'barely', 'invented', 'word', 'let', 'alone', 'embarked', 'crusade', 'make', 'world', 'safe', 'Greek', 'footsoldier', 'Thermopylae', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'duty', 'city', 'clan', 'gods', 'personal', 'honor', 'was', 'not', 'high-minded', 'speechifying', 'put', 'mouth', 'late', '20th', 'century', 'partisan', 'blowhards', 'ridiculous', 'ascribe', 'attitudes', 'beliefs', 'peoples', 'distant', 'past', 'especially', 'when', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'Greeks', 'OWN', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'time', 'preserved', 'own', 'histories', 'literature', 'mostly', 'ignored', 'sadly', 'filmmakers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'saved', 'democracy', 'talk', 'accounts', 'Even', 'notion', 'Spartans', 'were', 'somehow', 'professionals', 'more', 'bit', 'sloppy', 'drew', 'pay', 'service', 'were', 'not', 'professional', 'way', 'modern', 'mercenaries', 'are', 'professional', 'Spartan', 'citizens', 'homoioi', 'were', 'class', 'landed', 'gentry', 'other', 'designated', 'occupation', 'war', 'much', 'medieval', 'knights', 'would', 'have', 'occupied', 'training', 'hunting', 'politicking', 'overseeing', 'estates', 'actually', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'making', 'war', 'might', 'expect', 'conservative', 'Sparta', 'not', 'eager', 'rock', 'boat', 'stratified', 'society', 'risk', 'precious', 'limited', 'manpower', 'wastefully', 'Spartan', 'formed', 'more', 'less', 'permanent', 'standing', 'militia', 'training', 'discipline', 'organization', 'internal', 'cohesiveness', 'were', 'leagues', 'what', 'typical', 'Greek', 'citizen-soldier', 'was', 'capable', 'was', 'secret', 'Sparta', 'battlefield', 'success.Enough', 'None', 'what', ""'ve"", 'written', 'will', 'sway', 'impassioned', '300', 'fanboys', 'who', 'will', 'insist', 'rewriting', 'history', 'suit', 'own', 'power', 'fantasies', 'including', 'producers', 'cable', 'TV', 'documentaries', 'cater', 'such', 'tastes', 'truly', 'well-made', 'balanced', 'engaging', 'documentary', 'ancient', 'Sparta', 'aspects', 'fascinating', 'society', 'badly', 'served', 'one-dimensional', 'third-rate', 'effort', 'recommend', 'viewers', 'Spartans', '180', 'minutes', 'hosted', 'Bettany', 'Hughes', 'produced', 'UK', 'aired', 'released', 'US', 'PBS', 'can', 'get', 'Amazon', 'much', 'better', 'service', 'memory', 'Leonidas', 'immortal', 'Three', 'Hundred']",Last Stand of the 300: The Legendary Battle at Thermopylae
