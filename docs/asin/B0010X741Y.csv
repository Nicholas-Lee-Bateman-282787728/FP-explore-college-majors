I too expect that for those not familiar with the Discworld, it may be a little mystifying, but for those of us that are, the little details were wonderful.  I particularly liked the rendition of HEX, complete with the ""Anthill Inside"" sticker and the little hourglass which popped out when it was processing.  Getting a look at actual actors in costume playing Constable Visit and Nobby Nobbs, however briefly, was a treat--in fact, all the costuming and casting was very reminiscent of the way the Discworld is pictured in the Paul Kidby illustrations.  The rendition of Susan and Bilious the Oh God inside the child's painting on their way to the Tooth Fairy's domain was excellent and very much as I had imagined it.  Finally, Terry Pratchett himself makes a cameo appearance as the proprietor of the toy store where Death purchases the wooden horse to give to the young Albert.  This movie really gives me hope for the ""Light Fantastic/Color of Magic"" movie which I understand is in the works--it shows that the Discworld CAN be translated to the live screen.  My only negative criticism is that every time Mr. Teatime spoke with that weird voice of his, I was reminded of the Church Lady on Saturday Night Live--it may be that the actor just didn't understand how this would sound to an American ear.

1127126,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0010X741Y,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 1]","Part of the difficulties with translating a book to film is losing much of what the author tries to convey. Books allow the writer to squeeze in much more character information and wit, while films must do so in (usually) under two hours. Thankfully this duology expands that time line a tad to a much needed three hours and nine minutes. I say much needed because author Terry Pratchett's books deserve the full treatment in terms of time. But, unfortunately, even with this extended amount, the story suffers in translation. Although I must give credit to direct Vadim Jean (who also did the screenplay adaption and continues to adapt Mr. Pratchett's excellent Discworld series), it's tough to give a ravingly positive review to something that I enjoyed only marginally as much as the written works.I remember sitting in a restaurant on a meal break one day and having portions of a ham sandwich fly from my nose while reading Hogfather. Death (in the film voiced very well by Ian Richardson,Becoming Jane) is a central character, and both the book and the movie keep it that way. But what is lost is the clever witticisms of the narrator (Pratchett) that often causes the reader to nearly choke with restrained laughter while trying to keep from puking or inhaling food particles. It was, however, pretty funny to see Death cloaked in Santa (i.e., Hogfather) garb while mushing a sleigh towed by heavily-tusked boars.Marc Warren (Wanted) as Mr. Teatime was a good choice, as he had just the right amount of ruthlessness (which was plenty) and naivet&eacute; (toward his fellow Discworld inhabitants) to make him a fearfully funny antagonist.However, from here things get off-track. Michelle Dockery plays Susan, the main protagonist, but is mostly lost amidst the larger story. Her part was vital in the novel, but here we simply don't see that much of her in terms of character development. Beating up monsters under the bed? Funny, yes. Trying to protect her scythe-wielding relative? Okay, pretty funny. But what of the rest of her development? In truth, there isn't any in the film. She simply rushes off to help save Hogswatch Eve without much knowledge as to why she's so gung-ho to do it.The remaining characters are also given excessively abbreviated versions, which made the entire film much less laughable. Indeed, I think I only chuckled a few times during the entire three-plus hours, showing just how much was lost in translation.I will say, again, that I don't blame writer/director Vadim Jean for this. Without a doubt, this is a tough sell. How can you make something so densely funny as one of Mr. Pratchett's wonderful Discworld books into a guffaw-riddled flick? I think the simple answer is that you can't. And I think this adaptation proves it. But I will give Mr. Jean credit for trying. He succeeded on a very small level but I fear those that haven't read the novels might be less-than-impressed.Sorry guys.",3,Much Is Lost In Translation...,1227657600,"11 26, 2008",2008,2934,"['Part', 'difficulties', 'translating', 'book', 'film', 'losing', 'much', 'what', 'author', 'convey', 'Books', 'writer', 'squeeze', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'information', 'wit', 'films', 'must', 'do', 'so', 'usually', 'two', 'hours', 'Thankfully', 'duology', 'time', 'line', 'tad', 'much', 'needed', 'three', 'hours', 'nine', 'minutes', 'say', 'much', 'needed', 'because', 'author', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'books', 'deserve', 'full', 'treatment', 'terms', 'time', 'unfortunately', 'even', 'extended', 'amount', 'story', 'suffers', 'translation', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'direct', 'Vadim', 'Jean', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'screenplay', 'adaption', 'adapt', 'Mr.', 'Pratchett', 'excellent', 'Discworld', 'series', 'tough', 'give', 'ravingly', 'positive', 'review', 'something', 'enjoyed', 'only', 'marginally', 'as', 'much', 'written', 'works.I', 'remember', 'sitting', 'restaurant', 'meal', 'break', 'one', 'day', 'having', 'portions', 'ham', 'sandwich', 'fly', 'nose', 'reading', 'Hogfather', 'Death', 'film', 'voiced', 'very', 'well', 'Ian', 'Richardson', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'central', 'character', 'book', 'movie', 'keep', 'way', 'what', 'lost', 'clever', 'witticisms', 'narrator', 'Pratchett', 'often', 'reader', 'nearly', 'choke', 'restrained', 'laughter', 'trying', 'keep', 'puking', 'inhaling', 'food', 'particles', 'was', 'however', 'pretty', 'funny', 'see', 'Death', 'cloaked', 'Santa', 'i.e.', 'Hogfather', 'garb', 'mushing', 'sleigh', 'towed', 'heavily-tusked', 'boars.Marc', 'Warren', 'Wanted', 'Mr.', 'Teatime', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'ruthlessness', 'was', 'plenty', 'eacute', 'fellow', 'Discworld', 'inhabitants', 'make', 'fearfully', 'funny', 'antagonist.However', 'here', 'things', 'get', 'off-track', 'Michelle', 'Dockery', 'Susan', 'main', 'protagonist', 'mostly', 'lost', 'amidst', 'larger', 'story', 'part', 'was', 'vital', 'novel', 'here', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'terms', 'character', 'development', 'Beating', 'up', 'monsters', 'bed', 'Funny', 'yes', 'Trying', 'protect', 'scythe-wielding', 'relative', 'Okay', 'pretty', 'funny', 'what', 'rest', 'development', 'truth', ""n't"", 'film', 'simply', 'help', 'save', 'Hogswatch', 'Eve', 'much', 'knowledge', 'why', 'so', 'gung-ho', 'do', 'it.The', 'remaining', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'given', 'excessively', 'abbreviated', 'versions', 'made', 'entire', 'film', 'much', 'less', 'laughable', 'Indeed', 'think', 'only', 'chuckled', 'few', 'times', 'entire', 'three-plus', 'hours', 'showing', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'lost', 'translation.I', 'will', 'say', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'writer/director', 'Vadim', 'Jean', 'doubt', 'tough', 'sell', 'How', 'can', 'make', 'something', 'so', 'densely', 'funny', 'one', 'Mr.', 'Pratchett', 'wonderful', 'Discworld', 'books', 'guffaw-riddled', 'flick', 'think', 'simple', 'answer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'adaptation', 'will', 'give', 'Mr.', 'Jean', 'credit', 'trying', 'succeeded', 'very', 'small', 'level', 'fear', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'novels', 'might', 'be', 'less-than-impressed.Sorry', 'guys']",N/A

I liked it more than I did the two animated Discworld movies. The casting was pretty spot-on, especially with Teatime (though I think Brian Blessed would've made a better Ridcully.

If I had no desire to see the movie because I've enjoyed the books, the trailer wouldn't have done it for me.The interview with Terry Pratchett was sort-of decent, though the sound quality and editing were miserable.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 4]","Twas the night before Hogwatch, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring... because the only person stirring was Death in a Hogsfather costume.And fortunately the BBC's first live-action adventure in Terry Pratchett's Discworld is a brilliant affair -- faithful, hilarious, and full of intricate plotting and gutsplitting satire. It also manages to mingle the unsentimental observations about human nature with a feel-good message -- not an easy thing to do, especially in a Christmas-related movie.On the night before Hogswatch, the Auditors enlist the Assassins' Guild for a very special job: ""delete"" the Hogfather. For this, Lord Downey calls on the psychotically childlike Mr. Teatime (Marc Warren), who has already figured out ways to kill the Hogfather, Soulcake Duck, and even Death. Soon Death (Ian Richardson) finds that the Hogfather has vanished --and takes on the Hogfather's duties for the night, much to the disgust of his granddaughter Susan (Michelle Dockery).But realizing that something is very seriously wrong with the world, Susan begins investigating the origins of the Hogfather, and the terrible reasons that he has vanished. Mr. Teatime and a locksmith, wizard and trio of thieves have infiltrated the Tooth Fairy's castle and have somehow contrived to erase the Hogfather. And the wizards -- after opening a lethal bathroom for the bombastic Ridcully (Joss Ackland) -- learn that strange creatures are coming into existence, such as the Verruca Gnome and the Eater of Socks (not to mention Bilious, the Oh God of Hangovers).Now Susan must somehow find a way to bring back the Hogfather -- or else despite all Death's best efforts (""And what do you want, small human?"") the world will lose much more than a jolly fat anthropomorphic personification.Watching ""The Hogfather,"" it's pretty obvious that the people involved loved the the original book It's extremely faithful to the original Terry Pratchett novel (including in-jokes and cameos) and has the same offbeat weirdness (""TO THE LAUNDRY!""). And while the four main subplots seem scattered and sometimes unclear, as the movie goes on they intertwine tightly and suddenly become very relevant to one another.And since this is based on a Pratchett book, we're graced with some cynical views on humanity and the nature of belief -- and occasionally touching moments, like Death rescuing a little match girl. There's even a bittersweet edge near the end when Susan confronts the core of the Tooth Fairy's castle, and finds something very unexpected there.But along the way, we're treated to plenty of hilarious dialogue (""Have you been a good l... a good n... a good individual?""), wildly bizarre slapstick moments (Ridcully scalding himself with Old Faithful) and in-jokes (the inventions of Bloody Stupid Johnson). Barely a scene goes by without something to laugh at, whether it's Teatime's hysterically sick behavior or Death's attempts at yuletide jollity (including a list of things to do at each house, ending with a halfhearted ""ho ho ho"").The brilliant comedy hits a high note when Death invades a shopping mall so he can have the children tell him what they want (""And be good. This is part of the arrangement."" ""All right!"" ""Then we have a contract""), much to the dismay of the store owner (""He's sitting in his grotto, bold as brass... GIVING AWAY PRESENTS!""Dockery makes a magnificent Susan -- a little chilly, very strong-willed and determined to be as normal as possible. Warren is a delightfully creepy Teatime with his mismatched eyes and childish voice, and the late Ian Richardson was simply great as Death, whether he's being benevolent or sinister (""Have you been naughty...

All the way back to that red and white, the colors of blood on snow.The Discworld has Auditors, creatures who loath humanity and all the things that make us human. The Auditors engage the Guild of Assassins to whack the Hogfather, and the Guild designates the very spooky Jonathan Teatime (it's pronounced ""tee-ah-tim-eh""), who hires a gang and methodically sets about this task. It takes Death; Death's granddaughter, Susan; Bilious, the Oh God of Hangovers; most of the wizardly faculty of Unseen University; and the Tooth Fairy to defeat Teatime, his gang and the Auditors.Because more is at stake than Father Christmas.

This particular Hogswatch, something is amiss, however.  The Auditors have approached the assassin's guild and taken out a contract on the Hogfather (you know, Santa.)  How do you kill a potentially mythological creature?  Well, the guild decides to send their craziest assassin, Teatime (Marc Warren) to do the job.As Teatime goes about his mission, the body count begins to rise, which catches the attention of Death (a wonderful puppet voiced by Ian Richardson).  Over the years, Death has grown fond of humans, so he sets out to fill in for the suddenly missing Hogfather.And Death's antics catch the attention of Susan (Michelle Dockery), his granddaughter.  When Susan learns what is happening, she sets out to find the Hogfather and save his life, a mission that takes her to the Tooth Fairy's castle.  Will she be in time?While I'm not normally a fantasy fan, I had heard of Terry Pratchett's popular Discworld series.  This British TV miniseries is based on one of his stories.  I'm pretty conflicted about it.  On the one hand, there was plenty of fun in the story and setting.  The acting was wonderful.  And the movie looked incredible.  It was very state of the art and has plenty of eye candy.  I especially loved watching the ""computer"" write on parchment with quill and ink.  While there are some discussions about belief that will fly over kids' heads, there's nothing here that should really frighten them.However, it moved pretty slowly.  It is three hours long and could easily be cut down to two if they wanted to make the effort.  There is a whole sub-plot involving a wizarding college that could have been cut and the needed information worked in some other way.

1127158,A2UQKHJOTE0UW1,B0010X741Y,MarsTwain,"[4, 5]","I've been a huge Terry Pratchett fan for years and was thrilled to realize they'd come out with a live-action film. After the less-than-perfect animations, I'd been hoping actors could put a spin on the material that would not only follow the books faithfully (which all the films, animated and live do) but also capture that strange humor that makes the books so amazing. So I bought Hogfather back when it wasn't yet available for rent on region 2 just to see it. Did it perform as hoped?Hmm. Not so much. I blame mostly the pacing. For some reason, and this applies to Colour of Magic too (though I'm praying not to the upcoming Going Postal that has a new director) the film just plods along from sequence to sequence with no feeling of continuity or punctuation. Also, Pratchett's hilarious lines and slapstick situations are based on a very solid connection to our own reality and without that recognition and bleed-through, the jokes are not very funny. Since they never explain the details of the Discworld, newcomers are left floating in uncertainty; no connection, no funny. Also, while I felt Susan was very well played and some of the other characters done well enough, the portrayal of Teatime as Johnny Depp's Willie Wonka--almost a direct rip-off--was so distracting and annoying I flinched everytime he was on screen. He's on screen a lot. He's only occasionally menacing and for a lead villian to be annoying instead of dangerous has a way of sapping the urgency out of a film.That and the pacing. Geez, it dragged on. The sets and costumes are brilliant but many of the FX are super cheesy, reminding us this was made for TV. The slow strange timing of the script and editing made the cheesy extremely obvious as you sat there for a few seconds wondering what came after a line was delivered and nothing did but you staring at something that should've been shaved closer to the action. The action is...not exciting. Editing and pacing. Sucks.

1127162,A3MJMZF6NHCHXX,B0010X741Y,"Missy Hoppe ""mitmee_pie""","[0, 1]","I absolutely love anything and everything pertaining to discworld; I have 2 characters on the Discworld online game, one of which is a newbie helper. I've listened to every single one of the discworld books at least twice, and preordered the Colour of Magic DVD from Amazon.uk the very second I possibly could. With all that being said, I simply had to get my hands on this movie as soon as I heard it existed. Fortunately, I have a region free DVD player, so I ended up purchasing the region 2 2 disc edition of Hogfather. I can't say enough about how much I love this movie. It is very faithful to the book; in a lot of cases, dialogue is word for word out of the book, something which, at least in my humble opinion, is all to rare in book to movie adaptations. Another treat for me was that Nigel Planer, the narrator of the first 23 Discworld audio books, played the part of Sidney the wizard in the movie. As if that wasn't awesome enough, David Jason, who is currently one of my two favorite actors along side Hugh Laurie, played the part of Albert brilliantly. I thought that Ian Richardson did a fantastic job as the voice of death; he sounded just like I would imagine Death sounding from the books. Evrything I've already mentioned would be more than enough to earn this movie 5 stars as far as I'm concerned, but the real icing on the cake, for me at least, was when I discovered that the region 2 version of the Hogfather DVD which I had purchased included audio description for visually impaired viewers. As a blind individual, this fact in and of itself immediatley catipolted the Hogfather DVD into my top 10 favorites. It was great to know everything that was going on,while still watching the movie by myself. Further more, I was able to watch this movie with a blind friend, and even though he knew nothing about discworld, he was still able to follow what was going on and ended up enjoying it almost as much as I did. I'm planning to share this movie with my parents over the Christmas/Hogswatch holiday and hope that they'll enjoy it too. If I were forced to come up with something negative to say about this DVD, the only thing I could possibly consider a flaw, and I'll be the first to admit that it's hardly even worth mentioning, is that I think that Tony Robinson should have played the part of Knobby Knobs; just based on the fact that he played thepart of Baldrick in Black Adder. I could be completely off base on wanting that change, though, so please feel free to take my opinion regarding that issue with a pound or two of salt.In all seriousness, however, I would most definitely rate this movie adaptation of Hogfather 10 stars. I don't know if audio description is available on the US edition of Hogfather, but I would certainly hope so. In my humble opinion, audio description should be as readily available as closed captioning, but that's not at all relevant to this review. Incidentally, I just got the Region 2 DVD for The Colour of Magic, which is even better than Hogfather,and it also includes audio description.Bottom line: If you even remotely enjoy good British humor, fantasy, discworld or if you're just in the market for a different kind of Christmas movie, this DVD is an absolute must buy.In closing, I can't help adding that if you enjoyed this movie and end up becoming a discworld fan, if you're already a discworld fan or even if you just enjoy online gaming, you should come and visit the discworld online game.

I might've actually cringed at some scenes.Another reason I didn't care so much for the movie is that it's over 3 hours long.  I think I read the book faster than that.  If you're getting this movie for your kid, good luck getting them to sit through it.

1127165,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B0010X741Y,Newton Ooi,"[3, 3]","This TV miniseries came out on the Sci-Fi channel in 2007 and is based on a book of the same name.  The book itself is part of a series of books about a fictional world called Discworld which is an amalgamation of Victorian England, a netherworld of mythological beings, an imaginary world brought to life in children's drawings, and a world of wizards that connects all of them.  This world happens to have their equivalent of Christmas, which they call Hogswatch, and instead of Santa Claus, they have the Hogfather.  Certain spirits want the Hogfather dead, and hire a cunning assassin named Teatime to ""inhume"" him, where inhume is the opposite of exhume, and hence means to put into the grave.There are 3 main plot lines that all converge at the very end.  The first plot line follows Teatime from his acceptance of the ""hit"" on the Hogfather to his final demise.  The second plot line follows Susan, the blonde lady on the DVD cover.  She tries to stop Teatime.  And the final plot line follows Death and his assistant Albert.  Death is represented by a grim reaper, and happens to be the adopted grandfather of Susan.The movie relies on hilarious dialogue and unbelievable logic to carry forward a story that is short on action.  The special effects are limited, but quite effective.  The musical score is plain, but quite appropriate for a movie built on wit, irony, sarcasm, and unexpected plot turns.  The mood of the movie ranges from macabre to ludicrious to melancholy.  Yet like all good British movies, there are scenes that provide important insights into the human psyche.

I wasn't sure what to expect from a live action Discworld movie, I just couldn't imagine that the humor could translate properly.  In the end, it did and it didn't.A short Summary:In the fantasy world of Discworld, their winter festival is called Hogswatch, which is ruled over by the Hogfather... a fat jolly man with tusks who doles out gifts to nice little children.  An Assassin is hired to ""take care of"" the Hogfather, and he goes about it by invading the lair of the Toothfairy.  To try to keep the world in order, Death puts on the Hogfather Costume and tries to sub in for the evening... meanwhile, Death's grandaughter, Susan is off to figure out what happened to the Hogfather.If you have read the book, then you know that you probably laughed so hard you cried.  Though the movie is funny, it is not nearly so as the book.  They remain fairly faithful to the book, cutting only where necessary.  But if you have not read the book... then you will watch this film in puzzlement.  There is a great deal of assumption by the filmmakers that the viewer is already aware of Discworld and how it works.  The opening shot of Great A'tuin with the four elephants is shown but never explained.  The Unseen university is baffling if you don't already know about the wizards, and the Death of Rats makes no sense at all.But if you HAVE read the book, you will be able to follow quite happily seeing the characters from your head pop into life.The acting, though theatrical, is wonderful.  The costuming is brilliant and the sets are strange and beautiful.  Susan is a powerful yet likeable character. Death, though his mouth never moves, is one of the most human creatures in the film.  Albert is a scream... you can't help but love him.Final summary:  If you have read and enjoyed the book, this film is a must-see.  If you have not read the book, then you might enjoy the movie... but you won't ""get"" most of it because of the level of discworld knowledge you are assumed to already have.Kiddie Rating - I will probably let my kids watch this (ages 6 and 10) there are a few murders but very little blood, and they are not overly graphic.  I didn't catch any profanity on my first watch through, there is of course no nudity.  I would be more concerned of their lack of interest because I'm not sure if they are old enough to comprehend the humor of Death delivering presents dressed as a jolly fat man.",4,Faithful to the book... read the book first,1197417600,"12 12, 2007",2007,2455,"['much', 'hunting', 'found', 'DVD', 'US', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'live', 'action', 'Discworld', 'movie', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'humor', 'could', 'translate', 'properly', 'end', 'did', 'short', 'Summary', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Discworld', 'winter', 'festival', 'called', 'Hogswatch', 'ruled', 'Hogfather', 'fat', 'jolly', 'man', 'tusks', 'who', 'out', 'gifts', 'nice', 'little', 'children', 'Assassin', 'hired', 'take', 'care', 'Hogfather', 'invading', 'lair', 'Toothfairy', 'try', 'keep', 'world', 'order', 'Death', 'Hogfather', 'Costume', 'tries', 'sub', 'evening', 'meanwhile', 'Death', 'grandaughter', 'Susan', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'Hogfather.If', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'know', 'probably', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'cried', 'movie', 'funny', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'book', 'remain', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'book', 'cutting', 'only', 'where', 'necessary', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'will', 'watch', 'film', 'puzzlement', 'great', 'deal', 'assumption', 'filmmakers', 'viewer', 'already', 'aware', 'Discworld', 'how', 'opening', 'shot', 'Great', ""A'tuin"", 'four', 'elephants', 'shown', 'never', 'explained', 'Unseen', 'university', 'baffling', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'wizards', 'Death', 'Rats', 'sense', 'all.But', 'HAVE', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'quite', 'happily', 'seeing', 'characters', 'head', 'pop', 'life.The', 'acting', 'though', 'theatrical', 'wonderful', 'costuming', 'brilliant', 'sets', 'are', 'strange', 'beautiful', 'Susan', 'powerful', 'yet', 'likeable', 'character', 'Death', 'mouth', 'never', 'moves', 'one', 'most', 'human', 'creatures', 'film', 'Albert', 'scream', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'him.Final', 'summary', 'have', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'book', 'film', 'must-see', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'then', 'might', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'most', 'level', 'discworld', 'knowledge', 'are', 'assumed', 'already', 'have.Kiddie', 'Rating', 'will', 'probably', 'let', 'kids', 'watch', '6', '10', 'are', 'few', 'murders', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'are', 'not', 'overly', 'graphic', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'profanity', 'first', 'watch', 'course', 'nudity', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'concerned', 'lack', 'interest', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'comprehend', 'humor', 'Death', 'delivering', 'presents', 'dressed', 'jolly', 'fat', 'man']",N/A

You can't read the book without tissue to mop up the tears from laughing and maybe a trip to the bathroom. Pratchett is one of the funniest men on this planet.I think the book translated well to film, although I am wondering if someone who hadn't read the book could follow it as well.  It's the story of Discworld's winter holiday Hogswatch, which is presided over by the Hogfather, something like St. Nick with a sleigh pulled by hogs and his own tusks.The Auditors, who count everything, decide to do away with the Hogfather.  To do so, they hire the Assassins Guild (in Discworld there is a Guild for everything).  In turn the head of the Assassins Guild hires Teatime, a sociopathic killer.  Death decides to foil the plot and through a series of machinations, gets his granddaughter Susan involved.The film isn't near as funny as the book. I think the creators did a great job of casting the characters.  Appearances even voices were so on with what I saw and heard in my head when I read the story.This is billed as a children's movie.  It's not particularly rough, although there are some murders.  Most of the violence is without gore.I definitely recommend ""Hogfather"" for Pratchett fans and as well for people like my husband and I who don't do traditional Christmas films.

1127172,A4FX5YCJA630V,B0010X741Y,"R. M. Fisher ""Ravenya""","[0, 0]","The most important thing you must know before watching ""Hogfather"" is that if you haven't readthe book by Terry Pratchett, you'll be utterly and hopelessly lost. That's what happened to me, and though I managed to grasp some of the basics by the halfway mark, I was still left scratching my head over some of the more quirky aspects of the storyline.I know that the immediate rebuttal to this is to ""read the book!"" but I don't think that familiarity with source material should be a factor when it comes to watching adaptations. They should be able to stand on their own. I hadn't readThe Lord of the Ringswhen I watched Peter Jackson's film for the first time, but I not only understood exactly what was happening, but enjoyed it immensely. This on the other hand... not so much.So consider this a review by a non-Pratchett fan, for fellow non-Pratchett fans. Maybe you'll chose to watch it anyway, maybe you'll seek out the book instead, maybe you'll give it a miss. But at least trust me on this: that without foreknowledge of the original novel, you'll probably be as bewildered as I was.The alternative world known as Discworld, which floats through space on the back of a giant turtle, has several profound differences from our reality - but also a few familiar echoes. Every year the people of the world celebrate Hogswatch, a festival in which a large jolly man delivers presents during the night to children everywhere. Only this year, a group of hooded specters have approached the Guild of Assassins with a new commission: to kill the Hogfather.The plot that follows - at least from what I could fathom - involves the job being handed over to a creepy glass-eyed assassin known as Mr Teatime (pronounced te-a-time-ee) who decides that the best way to kill the Hogfather is to break into the castle of the Tooth Fairy, using all the teeth that are stored there to perform a spell that tampers with the minds of the children that they once belonged to. If they don't believe in the Hogfather, then he loses all his power.But with the Hogfather unable to perform his annual duties, a very unexpected substitute takes his place: none other than Death himself. With a fake beard over his skeletal face and a pillow stuffed up under his robes, he actually does a fairly decent job, satirizing some of the most saccharine Christmas platitudes along the way. Stopping Mr Teatime is a task that falls to Death's grand-daughter Susan, posing as a governess but possessing a few magical gifts of her own.As it stands, I've no idea why the cloaked specters wanted the Hogfather dead in the first place, or what the point of several befuddled wizards in a lengthy subplot was all about. And before you give me the answers in the comment box - I'm sure the book had very good reasons for the existence of all these things. My problem is that the miniseries doesn't.But the biggest problem was pacing. For a miniseries that's made up of two one-and-a-half hour episodes (which encompass the course of a single night), things move *achingly* slowly, with scenes that seem to drag on forever. One scene has Susan watching over the two young children in her care - she enters the room, kisses each of them in turn, and then leaves again. It takes forty-three seconds to depict what decent editing could have conveyed in just five, and it's one example of the achingly tedious string of scenes that show characters walking to and fro, looking at things, staring thoughtfully into the middle-distance, or doing banal everyday things that any sensible director would have cut out completely. There's simply no energy or urgency at all.Among the actors are a few familiar faces. Michelle Dockery (in a pre-Downton Abbeyrole) plays the droll Susan, whilst Marc Warren is the creepy antagonist Teatime. Ian Richardson lends his voice in a surprisingly fitting portrayal of Death, with David Jason as his assistant Alfred (complete with fake pointy ears). David Warner and Tony Robinson have roles which barely warrant cameos, but make the most of them.In a nutshell, it's the talent of the actors versus the uninspiring direction and sluggish pacing. They recite their lines with as much gusto as they're able, but they've seemingly been given no direction at all. For example, Marc Warren plays Teatime with a spooky childish lilt, but the direction fails to convey him with any sort of menace. When he kills people, it's so predictable and perfunctory that it saps all the suspense out of it.So there you have it non-book readers: it's confusing. After doing a bit of research, I learnt thatHogfatheris actually the twentieth book in the Discworld series, and the fourth one that has Death in a central role, so there's a good chance that even if I *had* sought out the book first, I may not have understood that either. It was always going to be a difficult story to adapt, but if anything, at least it was sufficiently intriguing that I'm now inclined to seek out Terry Pratchett's work. Having done that, I may be able to return to ""Hogfather"" with renewed appreciation.",3,"""Children of the World - Prepare to Think as You are Told...""",1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2014,5063,"['most',

1127173,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0010X741Y,Robert I. Hedges,"[4, 5]","If Santa was a Dungeons and Dragons addict, this is what Christmas would be like. ""Hogfather"" is a clever satire that takes place on the parallel planet of Discworld. In Discworld Santa's counterpart is the Hogfather, the porcine gift giver of Hogswatch employing a sleigh pulled by flying boars. To set up the conflict for the film ""The Auditors"" have employed the ultra-creepy Mr. Teatime from the Guild of Assassins to eliminate the Hogfather. The following story involves a truly bizarre cast of characters such as the Tooth Fairy, who proves crucial to the plot, and the Hair Loss Fairy, which will amuse more adults than children. Ultimately Death becomes involved as a fill-in Hogfather, becomes emotionally involved in the Hogswatch concept and has some great lines (""I don't normally care if they've been naughty or nice."") Death is discouraged only by the the waning of belief in the Hogfather, but sets to visit the whole world in one night via a ""special congruent reality"" and in the process undergoes several interesting trials, ultimately becoming a very endearing character.Along the way there are many great scenes that adults will relish even more than kids, such as the gig as a department store Hogfather (""And what do you want for Hogswatch, small human?"") and the backstory that the job as Hogfather started as an animal sacrifice to make the sun come up, but currently involves giving out presents as a result of industrial retraining. The story makes reference to many human myths (Discworld exists in space atop four giant elephants standing on a giant turtle) and has strange magical and mystical elements that are quite surreal for a movie nominally aimed at children: children's teeth become amazingly powerful and there's a great scene with a wizard in detox (I especially liked the legend ""Born to Rune"" on the back of the wizard's cape).After discovering that the Tooth Fairy is actually a franchise operation and dealing with a subplot about a creature that removes socks from the laundry, ""an eater of socks"", who looks like a possessed pangolin, we progress to an ever stranger battle for Discworld's future with swordplay and a scissor monster, ultimately dispensing just rewards to Mr. Teatime and righting the world for all. Throughout the film the dialogue is great (""Hi inner child; I'm the inner babysitter."") and enjoyable by kids and adults alike, even though kids will not understand all of the nuances. The conclusion is quite complex and odd, involves a boar and dog chase (the boar is the primeval Hogfather), the Tooth Fairy turns out to be a shapeshifting boogieman, and the Snowman of Death closes the movie out with the quote ""Now there is one final question: have you been naughty or nice?"" Pretty trippy stuff for a kid's Christmas movie: I loved it.The film features several extras including an interesting but odd interview with author Terry Pratchett who has written over thirty books in the Discworld series. The film has no nudity, I didn't notice any offensive language, but there are several murders (which are largely cartoonish) which makes this better for slightly older children.

1127176,AY7FHXNP0MMOC,B0010X741Y,"Shawn Smith ""Zaklog the Critical""","[3, 4]","This film is based on a novel of the same title by Terry Pratchett as part of his ongoing Discworld series. I've read the novel, along with a fair number of other Discworld books, so I might have some trouble addressing those who haven't.The movie concerns Santa---excuse me---the Hogfather and the mid-winter celebration he is a symbol of. More specifically, it's about a strange group out to kill San---the Hogfather and an even stranger group determined to keep him alive. You see, if the Hogfather dies, the morning of Chris---Hogswatch, the sun will not rise.Out to kill the Hogfather is a mysterious (literally) shadowy group known only as the Auditors, their hired assassin Jonathan Teatime (pronounced ""Teh-ah-tih-meh"" . . . sometimes) as well as a band of misfits in Teatime's pay, 3 thieves, one locksmith and a student wizard.Out to save the Hogfather's life and the world as we humans know it is Death (a.k.a. the Grim Reaper), his assistant/housekeeper Albert and his (mostly) human grand-daughter Susan (it's a long story).The main villain, Teatime, is more unsettling than actually frightening. His warped logic is effective in this equally bizarre situation. He is not so much bloodthirsty as utterly indifferent to human life, instantly ready to dispatch anyone no longer of use to him, including his followers. I won't go into detail concerning his plan, but will only describe it as both circuitous and ingenious.Death, in order to save the Hogfather, temporarily takes over his job. His utter unfitness for the role and his growing enthusiasm for it are both comical and endearing. As his housekeeper and temporary elf advises, ""Ho ho ho will suffice. You don't need to add, COWER BRIEF MORTALS.""The real hero, however, is Susan, a no-nonsense governess of the children of a middling-wealthy family. She is equally prepared for bed-time stories and basement monsters (which she thoroughly thrashes with a poker before kicking them out of the house.) Her calm, methodical determination to protect the Hogfather, and humanity into the bargain, is a perfect contrast to Teatime's lethally bent logic.Overall, this is a wonderfully funny fantasy film about Christmas, with a fair bit of philosophical fiber smuggled in through the side door. Past fans of Pratchett's books, rest easy; it's a scrupulously faithful adaptation of the novel. Future fans, this is a great introduction to Pratchett's world; be sure to go on to read the books as well, though.",5,"Cower brief mortals . . . er, excuse me, Ho Ho Ho.",1229472000,"12 17, 2008",2008,2470,"['film', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'title', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'part', 'ongoing', 'Discworld', 'series', ""'ve"", 'read', 'novel', 'fair', 'number', 'other', 'Discworld', 'books', 'might', 'have', 'trouble', 'addressing', 'who', ""haven't.The"", 'movie', 'concerns', 'Santa', '-the', 'Hogfather', 'mid-winter', 'celebration', 'symbol', 'More', 'specifically', 'strange', 'group', 'kill', 'San', '-the', 'Hogfather', 'even', 'stranger', 'group', 'determined', 'keep', 'alive', 'see', 'Hogfather', 'dies', 'morning', 'Chris', '-Hogswatch', 'sun', 'will', 'not', 'rise.Out', 'kill', 'Hogfather', 'mysterious', 'literally', 'shadowy', 'group', 'known', 'only', 'Auditors', 'hired', 'assassin', 'Jonathan', 'Teatime', 'pronounced', 'Teh-ah-tih-meh', 'sometimes', 'as', 'well', 'band', 'misfits', 'Teatime', 'pay', '3', 'thieves', 'one', 'locksmith', 'student', 'wizard.Out', 'save', 'Hogfather', 'life', 'world', 'humans', 'know', 'Death', 'a.k.a', 'Grim', 'Reaper', 'assistant/housekeeper', 'Albert', 'mostly', 'human', 'grand-daughter', 'Susan', 'long', 'story', '.The', 'main', 'villain', 'Teatime', 'more', 'unsettling', 'actually', 'frightening', 'warped', 'logic', 'effective', 'equally', 'bizarre', 'situation', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'bloodthirsty', 'utterly', 'indifferent', 'human', 'life', 'instantly', 'ready', 'dispatch', 'anyone', 'no', 'longer', 'use', 'including', 'followers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'concerning', 'plan', 'will', 'only', 'describe', 'circuitous', 'ingenious.Death', 'order', 'save', 'Hogfather', 'temporarily', 'job', 'utter', 'unfitness', 'role', 'growing', 'enthusiasm', 'are', 'comical', 'endearing', 'housekeeper', 'temporary', 'elf', 'Ho', 'ho', 'ho', 'will', 'suffice', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'add', 'COWER', 'BRIEF', 'MORTALS', 'real', 'hero', 'however', 'Susan', 'no-nonsense', 'governess', 'children', 'middling-wealthy', 'family', 'equally', 'prepared', 'bed-time', 'stories', 'basement', 'monsters', 'thoroughly', 'thrashes', 'poker', 'kicking', 'house', 'calm', 'methodical', 'determination', 'protect', 'Hogfather', 'humanity', 'bargain', 'perfect', 'contrast', 'Teatime', 'lethally', 'bent', 'logic.Overall', 'wonderfully', 'funny', 'fantasy', 'film', 'Christmas', 'fair', 'bit', 'philosophical', 'fiber', 'smuggled', 'side', 'door', 'Past', 'fans', 'Pratchett', 'books', 'rest', 'easy', 'scrupulously', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'novel', 'Future', 'fans', 'great', 'introduction', 'Pratchett', 'world', 'be', 'sure', 'go', 'read', 'books', 'well']",N/A

1127179,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B0010X741Y,Stephen A. Haines,"[10, 11]","Terry Pratchett fans long waited for the transformation of Discworld tales into visuals.  Computer games, animations and stage productions were all right in their place, but film adaptations are the mark of success.  Pratchett resisted adaptations because most producers ""didn't get it"".  Vadim Jean ""got it"" and has made the story of ""Hogfather"" into a fine film presentation.  As a TV production, there are limitations and omissions, but these do not detract from the success of Jean's efforts to bring Pratchett's story of intrigue, power and imagination to the small screen.But what of the newcomer to Pratchett and his Discworld?  Will they gain the same satisfaction from the visual presentation of one of the more compelling [and best-selling] authors of the past generation?  The DVD opens with a Bang.  Not a very Big one, but enough to discharge a wondrous sight - a disc sitting atop four elephants who stand on the carapace [""shell""] of a giant tortoise.  The vision certainly imparts the feeling that something unusual will follow.  Which it does: a young governess is reading ""Jack And The Beanstalk"" to a pair of youngsters on Hogswatch Eve.  Tucking them in, Susan notes: ""If you don't believe in the Hogfather, there won't be any presents.""  It is the film's key statement.For the Hogfather has gone missing.  This may be because the Auditors of the Universe, who resent life and loathe humans because they're unpredictable, have commissioned Guild of Assassins to have the Hogfather ""brought to an end"".  The Guild's Head assigns the job to a young Assassin, Mister Teatime [""Tee-ah tim-eh, most people get it wrong, Sir.""] who has already devised a plan to accomplish it.  Teatime gathers a team to put his plan into effect.  This scheme starts by kidnapping the Tooth Fairy.  Wot?Meanwhile, across town, the wizards of the Unseen University are experiencing some bizarre events.  Strange new beings enter their lives - not entirely strange, however, since they all seem to represent tales of their childhood.  Among the wizards is one who has constructed HEX, a ""thinking machine"".  You can tell what it is from the label ""Anthill Inside"" pasted on one side.  Archchancellor Ridcully is suspicious of such devices, but thinks he can make HEX do his bidding by mere shouting.Throughout these events, an Anthropomorphic Personification, known as Death, feels an imbalance in the universe.  Discovering the Hogfather has failed to go out on his rounds delivering gifts, Death dons a red suit, a false beard and, with his assistant Albert, undertakes the role.  Death is interested in humans, finding their habits and prejudices fascinating, and he wants to know more about them.  The rituals of Hogswatch [Christmas] are but one aspect.  Those rituals extend from deep time and are thereby fundamental.  Resolution of the Hogfather's disappearance and the Teatime Gang's invasion of the Tooth Fairy's castle are gently woven into the film's concluding scene.  There are many threads and the novice Discworld viewer will note there are many levels to the story.  That's what turns the first Discworld encounter into a habit.There are ""big names"" in this film - listed lead David Jason does a fine job as Albert, while Ian Richardson's voice of Death is peerless.  The surprise here is Michelle Dockery, who picks up this film early and keeps it essentially hers throughout.  She is relatively unknown, but won't be after this.  As a robed ""skellington"", Death is hardly visually appealing, but Richardson's inflections on Pratchett's text keep us smiling.  Unlike many ""fantasy"" or SciFi films, ""Hogfather"" relies on little in the way of ""special effects beyond Death's character.  Some snow stops falling and a few sparkling things are used, but the story is too straightforward to need extra dazzlement.  As with Pratchett's stories it's the characters and what they tell us that counts.  Watch this and see.

They all have a certain `British innocent cadence' to them.The reviewers who wowed this pig evidently never read the books.This film does NO justice. The lines are so poorly timed, and so poorly, well, delivered, they absolutely suck. Second graders could have done better. I blame the director for ruining them. The film portrays the story as a serious fantasy. The book is a COMEDIC fantasy, so full of puns and inept characters you wonder how they survive. It has undertones satirizing the British social structure. None of this is in the movie. Hilarious lines from the book are delivered seriously instead of off-handed. Lines that should have been said with humor, are spoken flat and without any sense of TIMING.The only character that fit was Nigel Planer (watch `The Young Ones DVDs. They are astoundingly hilarious).Instead of the character `Death' being confused and mystified by the idiosyncrasies of humans (in the books), he is filmed as a serious character with few foibles. In the book, his granddaughter, is constantly flustered by humans, but does her best to fit in. In the film, she is serious, and played without a bit of character. And again, her `comedic' remarks made in the book, are delivered as serious. So her satirical lines are totally lost. This was a worse translation to film than `A Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy' (which actually had a better script).One of the problems is the book is one of the later in the series. So there were no prior films setting up the viewer for the totally absurd world Pratchett created. And the world he created was hilarious.The whole point of this book was to satirize Santa Claus and our commercially instilled beliefs in fictional deities. Instead, they are all made out to be a serious characters (a la `Legend' and all the `Frosty The Snowman' tv shows). Hollywood making another Christmas story for the masses...Jason Warren portrays Mr Teatime (pronounced Tee-a-tim-ee). He is an aspiring Assassins Guild member. In the book, his chosen profession is treated with cynicism. The film makes him a serious villain.The ONLY redeeming factor in this fiasco, are the Wizards. They are properly shown as inept, and without courage. Their various wacky inventions and spells (which never work), are ALMOST brought out. Unfortunately, their roles were minimized, and acted woodenly, with no inspiration. If they were the best part, imagine how bad the rest is....Pass on this dog. Read the books PLEASE! Terry Pratchett is a gifted writer. The film needed to be presented in a Monty Pythonesque fashion. `Death' should have been acted like the `Death' in the last scene of Meaning of Life. After all, if you read the books, you would know HE  was written that way.If you are a Pratchett fan, avoid this like the plague.",1,"Great book, lousy movie",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,2878,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'read', 'love', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'books', 'Discworld', 'series', 'have', 'certain', 'British', 'innocent', 'cadence', 'them.The', 'reviewers', 'who', 'wowed', 'pig', 'evidently', 'never', 'read', 'books.This', 'film', 'justice', 'lines', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'timed', 'so', 'poorly', 'well', 'delivered', 'absolutely', 'suck', 'Second', 'graders', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'blame', 'director', 'ruining', 'film', 'story', 'serious', 'fantasy', 'book', 'COMEDIC', 'fantasy', 'full', 'puns', 'inept', 'characters', 'wonder', 'how', 'survive', 'undertones', 'satirizing', 'British', 'social', 'structure', 'None', 'movie', 'Hilarious', 'lines', 'book', 'are', 'delivered', 'seriously', 'instead', 'off-handed', 'Lines', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'humor', 'are', 'spoken', 'flat', 'sense', 'TIMING.The', 'only', 'fit', 'was', 'Nigel', 'Planer', 'watch', 'Young', 'Ones', 'DVDs', 'are', 'astoundingly', 'hilarious', '.Instead', 'character', 'Death', 'being', 'confused', 'mystified', 'idiosyncrasies', 'humans', 'books', 'filmed', 'serious', 'character', 'few', 'foibles', 'book', 'granddaughter', 'constantly', 'flustered', 'humans', 'best', 'fit', 'film', 'serious', 'played', 'bit', 'character', 'again', 'comedic', 'remarks', 'made', 'book', 'are', 'delivered', 'serious', 'satirical', 'lines', 'are', 'totally', 'lost', 'was', 'worse', 'translation', 'film', 'Hitchhikers', 'Guide', 'Galaxy', 'actually', 'had', 'better', 'script', '.One', 'problems', 'book', 'one', 'later', 'series', 'were', 'prior', 'films', 'setting', 'up', 'viewer', 'totally', 'absurd', 'world', 'Pratchett', 'created', 'world', 'created', 'was', 'hilarious.The', 'whole', 'point', 'book', 'was', 'satirize', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'commercially', 'instilled', 'beliefs', 'fictional', 'deities', 'Instead', 'are', 'made', 'out', 'be', 'serious', 'characters', 'la', 'Legend', 'Frosty', 'Snowman', 'tv', 'shows', 'Hollywood', 'making', 'Christmas', 'story', 'masses', 'Jason', 'Warren', 'Mr', 'Teatime', 'pronounced', 'Tee-a-tim-ee', 'aspiring', 'Assassins', 'Guild', 'member', 'book', 'chosen', 'profession', 'treated', 'cynicism', 'film', 'serious', 'villain.The', 'ONLY', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'fiasco', 'are', 'Wizards', 'are', 'properly', 'shown', 'inept', 'courage', 'various', 'wacky', 'inventions', 'spells', 'never', 'work', 'are', 'ALMOST', 'brought', 'out', 'Unfortunately', 'roles', 'were', 'minimized', 'acted', 'woodenly', 'inspiration', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'imagine', 'how', 'bad', 'rest', '.Pass', 'dog', 'Read', 'books', 'PLEASE', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'gifted', 'writer', 'film', 'needed', 'be', 'presented', 'Monty', 'Pythonesque', 'fashion', 'Death', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'acted', 'Death', 'last', 'scene', 'Meaning', 'Life', 'read', 'books', 'would', 'know', 'HE', 'was', 'written', 'way.If', 'are', 'Pratchett', 'fan', 'avoid', 'plague']",N/A

I just reviewedNationand I was embarrassed by how much I relied on the word ""delightful"" and sadly, I have to use it here too. This dvd sacrifices none of the humor or lighthearted weirdness in translation from print to video.The story is another one with Death vs. The Auditors. This time the Auditors are out to destroy the Disc World equivalent of Xmas by sending an assassin after The Hogfather. Susan of Stohelit (my personal favorite) is on hand to provide a human face, but for the most part this is Death's show. And Death riding around on a sleigh pulled by reindeer is the best visual I've seen in a long time.Yes, there are some flaws. It gets a bit slow by the end of the second act and the plan to kill Hogfather doesn't make any sense whatsoever, but I watched this on the third night of a Con where I was exhausted and cranky and wishing that I had decided to go home. I had a big stupid grin on my face the entire time. There's not a lot that can do that when I'm that cranky, in fact I can't think of anything else.

Based on the book of the same name by Terry Pratchett in his iconic Discworld this story has great heart and humor (which is witty and subtle so if you don't like that kind of humor, move along) but has important messages about faith and family. This movie, along with Neil Gaiman's Death graphic novels, changed my opinion on the subject of Death. Here, Death is, literally and figuratively, a grandfather figure who shows more humanity than some of the other living characters in the story. Quite frankly, if the real Death is anything like the stern but caring and unknowingly funny Terry Pratchett version or gothically-dressed but eternally perky and optimistic young woman as envisioned by Neil Gaiman then when it's my time to go I won't feel so bad. :-)",5,Favorite Holiday Movie,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",2013,943,"['was', 'once', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'television', '2', 'night', 'special', 'event', 'holidays', 'become', 'favorite', 'holiday', 'movie', 'watch', 'year', 'least', 'once', 'Based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'iconic', 'Discworld', 'story', 'great', 'heart', 'humor', 'witty', 'subtle', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'kind', 'humor', 'move', 'along', 'important', 'messages', 'faith', 'family', 'movie', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'Death', 'graphic', 'novels', 'changed', 'opinion', 'subject', 'Death', 'Here', 'Death', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'grandfather', 'figure', 'who', 'more', 'humanity', 'other', 'living', 'characters', 'story', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'real', 'Death', 'anything', 'stern', 'caring', 'unknowingly', 'funny', 'Terry', 'Pratchett', 'version', 'gothically-dressed', 'eternally', 'perky', 'optimistic', 'young', 'woman', 'envisioned', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'then', 'when', 'time', 'go', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'bad']",N/A

Imaginative readers have already created images of their favorite (and not-so-favorite) characters, so tend towards outrage when the movie-makers ""get it wrong."" Well, poo on them.The denizens of Pratchett's world have even more improbable character than the Flat Earth on which they reside, and its physics. There's Susan, for example, the governess who'll stare death in the eye, give him a sharp dressing down, and pick the lint off his cowl so he makes a good impression when making his rounds. Then there are the wizards, cloistered in the Unseen University. Think of it as a sheltered workshop for people who might not and dare not find employment elsewhere - if it weren't for five square meals a day and a steady stream of underclassmen to torment, who knows what they might do? Then there's Mr. Teatime (four syllables when you pronounce each vowel), the Assassin that makes the Guildmaster of the Assassins nervous.I like Pratchett's books enough to know that something lost in the translation to movie format, especially all the asides and groanable cultural references that make each page of his books into such gems. And, I admit, Death never wholly came to life for me. And Nobbs, well, everyone has their own Nobbs, and this wasn't mine. (It wasn't my movie, either.) Look at Leonardo's paintings, though: he left his thumbprint in the paint, for crying out loud, and no one complains. If you want to pick nits, you'll pick them. If you want to enjoy, you'll enjoy.
