1461014,A3UZQ1IW3XUZ73,B005HIBWCU,"B. Cathey ""ParsifalCSA""","[18, 19]","Joel McCrea was a natural as a Western actor. Despite his great successes in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, and in several other dramas of the late 1930s and early 1940s, it was the Western genre that he really loved. And he made some extremely fine ones, capping his long career and partnering with Randolph Scott in Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (1962), arguably one of the finest Westerns ever made. TROOPER HOOK is a slightly lesser effort from the late 1950s, but still a well-acted vehicle for McCrea and co-star Barbara Stanwyck.  Stanwyck is a white woman, captured and ""married to"" an Apache chief, and more, she has a son by him. McCrea is charged with rescuing her and returning her ""home."" And therein lies the source of a series of mishaps, battles with her Apache ""husband,"" and other complications. Edward Arnold and Earl Holliman add to the fine cast and resulting action.Now that MGM/UA have released several McCrea vehicles, it is time that Universal lets us have good prints of McCrea's fine early-1950s Westerns---the very enjoyable CATTLE DRIVE, the whimsical SADDLE TRAMP (with John McIntyre, Jeannette Nolan, and Russell Simpson), BLACK HORSE CANYON (the most gentle of McCrea's oaters), FRENCHIE (McCrea's take on the ""Destry"" story) and LONE HAND. Why not issue them in a set, just as Warner has done with some of the 1950s Scott Westerns?Joel McCrea was a genuine cowboy and a true gentleman. He is one of the most underrated actors ever to work in Hollywood films. His films deserve attention and will repay re-viewing.",5,Another good oater with Joel McCrea,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",2012,1566,"['Joel', 'McCrea', 'was', 'natural', 'Western', 'actor', 'great', 'successes', 'FOREIGN', 'CORRESPONDENT', 'SULLIVAN', 'TRAVELS', 'several', 'other', 'dramas', 'late', '1930s', 'early', '1940s', 'was', 'Western', 'genre', 'really', 'loved', 'made', 'extremely', 'fine', 'ones', 'capping', 'long', 'career', 'partnering', 'Randolph', 'Scott', 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'RIDE', 'THE', 'HIGH', 'COUNTRY', '1962', 'arguably', 'one', 'finest', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'TROOPER', 'HOOK', 'slightly', 'lesser', 'effort', 'late', '1950s', 'still', 'well-acted', 'vehicle', 'McCrea', 'co-star', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Stanwyck', 'white', 'woman', 'captured', 'married', 'Apache', 'chief', 'more', 'son', 'McCrea', 'charged', 'rescuing', 'returning', 'home', 'therein', 'source', 'series', 'mishaps', 'battles', 'Apache', 'husband', 'other', 'complications', 'Edward', 'Arnold', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'fine', 'cast', 'resulting', 'action.Now', 'MGM/UA', 'have', 'released', 'several', 'McCrea', 'vehicles', 'time', 'Universal', 'have', 'good', 'prints', 'McCrea', 'fine', 'early-1950s', 'Westerns', '-the', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'CATTLE', 'DRIVE', 'whimsical', 'SADDLE', 'TRAMP', 'John', 'McIntyre', 'Jeannette', 'Nolan', 'Russell', 'Simpson', 'BLACK', 'HORSE', 'CANYON', 'most', 'gentle', 'McCrea', 'oaters', 'FRENCHIE', 'McCrea', 'take', 'Destry', 'story', 'LONE', 'HAND', 'Why', 'not', 'issue', 'set', 'just', 'Warner', 'done', '1950s', 'Scott', 'Westerns', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'was', 'genuine', 'cowboy', 'true', 'gentleman', 'one', 'most', 'underrated', 'actors', 'ever', 'work', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'films', 'deserve', 'attention', 'will', 'repay', 're-viewing']",Trooper Hook

She plays a woman held captive for several years by hostile Indians and now has a child by the chief of the tribe.  Rescued by the cavalry she faces a lot of tough decisions.  She wants to keep her son who is about five or six years and is receiving pressure to turn him over to the tribe.  She refuses and is now going back to her white husband.  Meanwhile the chief has escaped captivity and is now in hot pursuit for his son.  Trooper Hook is the understanding soldier escorting her and protecting her and her son.

The sound and picture quality are good and there are no extras. The film starts with Apache messacre of some US Army soldiers on top of a rocky hill. Soon the US Army attack the Apache, lead by Sergeant Clovert Hook(JOEL McCREA). The army burn the village and round up the Indians. Chief Nanchez(RUDOLFO ACOSTA) is captured alive. Amongst the prisoners, they find a white woman, Cora Sutliffe(BARBARA STANWYCK) with her son Keto, whose father is Nanchez. They all head back to the Fort. When questioned by the Colonel, they find that Cora had been attacked by the Cherokawa Indians and her husband was missing. Nanchez was to be sent to Saint Carlos Reservation. Fred Sutliffe(EDWARD ANDREWS)is traced running a ranch near Tuscan. Orders are given to Trooper Hook to take Cora and Keto to that ranch. After receiving hostility at the first town, Trooper Hook takes a stagecoach for Cora and Keto. At the next town they get the same hostility. Then Cowboy Jeff Benam(EARL HOLLIMAN) joins the stagecoach at Wilson's Hotel. Hook and Cora also get talking about themselves and their past. As they pass some hills, Nanchez, with broken chains, watches the stagecoach from the top of the hills. Trooper Hook also sees distant dust cloud on the left side of the stagecoach. At the next stage post, a telegram comes saying that some of the braves had broken out Nanchez from the Fort 2 days ago. Hearing this Jeff takes a horse and warns Trooper Hook about Nanchez's escape.This excellent story of JACK SCHAFFER is beautifully photographed in B/W by ELLSWORTH FREDERICKS and briskly directed by CHARLES MARQUIS WARREN. There is also a good background song on 'Trooper Hook' sung by TEX RITTER. The action scenes are very good and Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck give masterly performances.JOEL ALBERT McCREA was born on 5.11.1905 in South Pasadena, California. After school, he acted on stage and took courses in drama. In 1927/28, he worked as extras and stuntman. In 1929, he signed contract with MGM and in 1930 moved to RKO. In 1940, his career peaked. He enjoyed doing westerns. His last film was in 1976 -'Mustang Country'. He worked with his son 'JODY' in some films. He married FRANCES DEE in 1933 and had 3 sons, DAVID, PETER and JODY. McCrea was proud of his Scottish Heritage. Even in 1940's, he was a Millionaire with land and his real-estate dealings. He made his final public appearance on 3.10.1990. On 20.10.1990, aged 84, he died in Woodland Hills, California, of pneumonia.Some of Joel McCrea's westerns are:-(1) San Francisco Story, 1952(2009)(2) Stranger on Horse, 1955(2008)(3) The Gunfight in Dodge City, 1959(2008)(4) Colorado Territory, 1949(2009)(5) Four Faces West, 1948(2003)(6) Wichita, 1955(2009)(7) Ride the High Country, 1962(2009)(8) The First Texan, 1956(2009)(9) The Outriders, 1950(2011)(10)The Olkahoman, 1957(2009)(11)Stars in My Crown, 1950(2011)(12)Buffalo Bill, 1944(2005)Watch and ENJOY.",5,TROOPER HOOK,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",2011,3005,"['movie', 'was', 'first', 'released', '1957', '2011', 'B/W', 'fullscreen', '83', 'minutes', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'extras', 'film', 'Apache', 'messacre', 'US', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'top', 'rocky', 'hill', 'Soon', 'US', 'Army', 'attack', 'Apache', 'lead', 'Sergeant', 'Clovert', 'Hook', 'JOEL', 'McCREA', 'army', 'burn', 'village', 'round', 'up', 'Indians', 'Chief', 'Nanchez', 'RUDOLFO', 'ACOSTA', 'captured', 'alive', 'Amongst', 'prisoners', 'find', 'white', 'woman', 'Cora', 'Sutliffe', 'BARBARA', 'STANWYCK', 'son', 'Keto', 'father', 'Nanchez', 'head', 'back', 'Fort', 'When', 'questioned', 'Colonel', 'find', 'Cora', 'had', 'been', 'attacked', 'Cherokawa', 'Indians', 'husband', 'was', 'missing', 'Nanchez', 'was', 'be', 'sent', 'Saint', 'Carlos', 'Reservation', 'Fred', 'Sutliffe', 'EDWARD', 'ANDREWS', 'traced', 'running', 'ranch', 'Tuscan', 'Orders', 'are', 'given', 'Trooper', 'Hook', 'take', 'Cora', 'Keto', 'ranch', 'receiving', 'hostility', 'first', 'town', 'Trooper', 'Hook', 'stagecoach', 'Cora', 'Keto', 'next', 'town', 'get', 'same', 'hostility', 'Then', 'Cowboy', 'Jeff', 'Benam', 'EARL', 'HOLLIMAN', 'stagecoach', 'Wilson', 'Hotel', 'Hook', 'Cora', 'also', 'get', 'talking', 'past', 'pass', 'hills', 'Nanchez', 'broken', 'chains', 'stagecoach', 'top', 'hills', 'Trooper', 'Hook', 'also', 'distant', 'dust', 'cloud', 'left', 'side', 'stagecoach', 'next', 'stage', 'post', 'telegram', 'saying', 'braves', 'had', 'broken', 'out', 'Nanchez', 'Fort', '2', 'days', 'ago', 'Hearing', 'Jeff', 'horse', 'Trooper', 'Hook', 'Nanchez', 'escape.This', 'excellent', 'story', 'JACK', 'SCHAFFER', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'B/W', 'ELLSWORTH', 'FREDERICKS', 'briskly', 'directed', 'CHARLES', 'MARQUIS', 'WARREN', 'also', 'good', 'background', 'song', ""'Trooper"", 'Hook', 'sung', 'TEX', 'RITTER', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'give', 'masterly', 'performances.JOEL', 'ALBERT', 'McCREA', 'was', 'born', '5.11.1905', 'South', 'Pasadena', 'California', 'school', 'acted', 'stage', 'took', 'courses', 'drama', '1927/28', 'worked', 'extras', 'stuntman', '1929', 'signed', 'contract', 'MGM', '1930', 'moved', 'RKO', '1940', 'career', 'peaked', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'westerns', 'last', 'film', 'was', '1976', ""-'Mustang"", 'Country', 'worked', 'son', 'films', 'married', 'FRANCES', 'DEE', '1933', 'had', '3', 'sons', 'DAVID', 'PETER', 'JODY', 'McCrea', 'was', 'proud', 'Scottish', 'Heritage', 'Even', '1940', 'was', 'Millionaire', 'land', 'real-estate', 'dealings', 'made', 'final', 'public', 'appearance', '3.10.1990', '20.10.1990', 'aged', '84', 'died', 'Woodland', 'Hills', 'California', 'pneumonia.Some', 'Joel', 'McCrea', 'westerns', 'are', '1', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Story', '1952', '2009', '2', 'Stranger', 'Horse', '1955', '2008', '3', 'Gunfight', 'Dodge', 'City', '1959', '2008', '4', 'Colorado', 'Territory', '1949', '2009', '5', 'Four', 'Faces', 'West', '1948', '2003', '6', 'Wichita', '1955', '2009', '7', 'High', 'Country', '1962', '2009', '8', 'First', 'Texan', '1956', '2009', '9', 'Outriders', '1950', '2011', '10', 'Olkahoman', '1957', '2009', '11', 'Stars', 'My', 'Crown', '1950', '2011', '12', 'Buffalo', 'Bill', '1944', '2005', 'Watch', 'ENJOY']",Trooper Hook
