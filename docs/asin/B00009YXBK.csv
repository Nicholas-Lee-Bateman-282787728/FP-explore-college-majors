Still, it moves faster than traditional yoga so it's easier to get through on days when I don't feel like I have enough patience to enter the yoga trance-like state.  It still leaves you with the invigorated feeling that yoga stretches & positions give you.  It's challenging; it will make you sweat; it builds beautiful long, lean muscles...but I hate the music.  Only thing that really, really bugs me.  Overall, in just 3 weeks of doing this 4-5 times/week (I have a baby and don't get much more time than an hour/day), I lost weight and dropped from an almost-size6 to a true size 4 and looked noticeably toner & more fit.

You don't hold any of the poses very long. It was more akin to aerobics than yoga.  I'm used to doing yoga for the stretches.

759874,A2K7JJRDB7RHKY,B00009YXBK,"Ara Lyman-gregg ""araautumn""","[7, 8]","Two and a half stars.  I think the routine is fun but the alignment is horrible!  The routine is a little different which is nice, sure some of the poses should be held for five breaths but that is not a big complaint for me it is just not as challenging as it could be.  My foundation in yoga is Iyengar which I bring into all other yoga, so when I saw the way the asanas are executed I was appalled, especially with Jesse who is supposed to be demonstrating the more advanced version of the pose.  Jesse can't stack his shoulders, keep his hips aligned, has a rounded back, shrugged shoulders, does not know proper foot placement or stance, basically don't do anything he does!  If he does not improve his alignment, he will have serious lower back problems.  The instuctors alignment is decent but her hips are not always aligned.  Challenge yourself and square or parallel your hips in standing split and down dog split, it is a lot more challenging than opening the hips like they do.  Also the music is pretty cheesy, MTV used to be cutting edge in music  but now they are just mainstream commercial hacks.So if you are familiar with yoga and power yoga (don't do this if you are novice) and know proper alignment you might like this workout.  I reccommend using the instuctors voice only option on the dvd and put on some good music of your own!  I turn the dvd off when it comes to the relaxation and do my own, I do this with a lot of yoga videos because savasana is hardly ever adequate on them.",2,Jesse!

I don't even mind that there's no warm up -- I can easily do one on my own. But there are other things that are less forgivable.First of all, Jesse a yoga expert? Please. He may be a ""certified yoga teacher,"" but even my novice eyes can see that his alignment is far from perfect and that he's not nearly as limber as others, who've been practicing yoga far longer. Jesse is proof positive that they are indeed handing out yoga teaching certificates in cereal boxes these days.Also, the two people who are supposedly demonstrating the modified moves are doing nothing of the kind. Whenever they are on camera, which isn't nearly often enough, they're doing the full expression of the poses. I don't even see any modifications of the really difficult poses.

Plus, I thought to myself, ""How can anything produced by MTV be anything but a trite waste of time?""  Now I am sorry I waited so long to purchase this high energy, fun, upbeat way to work my entire body, increase my energy, and focus my mind.  First, those who think the interesting opening , crescent lunge salutations are too fast need to merely practice and practice this maneuvre the way someone would learn a complex dance routine or memorize lines in a script.  Meditation, the true mind/body link can occur with any yogic sequence once the physical movements are first completely studied and learned.  Realize that even though this workout may move at a faster rate than five breath Ashtanga asana holds, it is still way slower than Kundalini yoga kriyas like the Warrior Workout.  Having studied both Kundalini and Ashtanga and possessing a vast power yoga library including most of Baptiste and Kest, I was shocked to discover how incredible and concise this product is.  I love learning new techniques and upon first watching this shockingly energetic video, I became obsessed with learning the first salutation which requires both mental and physical coordination.  Each time I do this workout, I feel more meditative, more in control, and more alert.  At first I assumed I would injure myself doing something in it (having hip and occasional back problems), but was amazed at how I felt very evenly worked out, more flexible, and ready to glide through life.  Also, I think Kristen's breath pacing during the standing pose sequence was as good as any other DVD I own.

White,"[26, 28]","I agree with a previous viewer in the fact that the warmup is hurried, and the positions aren't held very long, and the corpse pose is not held very long either.  However, I would not go so far as to say that this isn't yoga.  If you are the type of person who is very much into the spirtual side of yoga, and a slower pace with your yoga, don't bother. Besides did you REALLY expect spirtuality from a MTV ;-)?  I have been practising yoga a few years now, and I found the video challenging and fun.  There are some ashtanga-like aspects to the flow (kinda like an ashtanga-lite, for those who are not quite ready for the entire Primary Series :-)).  Once you get past the hurried sun-salutations, the workout gets better.  I particularly liked the balance and seated poses.  I especially liked the variation with beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of poses.  It gave me either modifications, or a way to deepen the pose. Some of the poses Kristin does can be found in the Primary Series of Ashtanga yoga (i.e. triangle, reverse-triangle, most of the seated stretching series, jumping in and out of poses, etc.).  The Pilates at the end of the tape is not bad either, a good way to work on abs after a fairly intense 45 minutes.  However, I don't think Windsor and other pilates gurus have much to worry about from Kristin as a pilates instructor.  Overall, this a solid yoga tape for a person with experience.  The level of the workout does assume you know a certain amount of yoga.

No matter how advanced a student you are, your warm-up should always be slow and gentle... hence ""warm-up"".The flow into Warrior One is incorrect and dangerous. The instructor tells you to flatten your rear foot first before stepping forward with your front leg - NO!! This will cause you to pull muscles in your lower back. You should ALWAYS step forward with your front leg first, then turn and plant your rear foot.During a series of Warrior One and Bent Knee Triangles, you are instructed to move directly from the Warrior One into the Triangle. Huh? What about that little pose in between called the Warrior Two?!?If that's not enough to turn you off, how about the floor pose stretching series she does with one leg (shin) bent underneath you. Think tearing your knee ligaments... I know some Yoga instructors that would NEVER attempt those variations. Hero pose is easier on your knees than what this instructor has you do.Simply put, this yoga does not flow well, I'd say it barely flows at all and the poses are presented incorrectly. Anyone that is advanced enough to do some of her variations safely would not be using a DVD to instruct them... and remember, I've been doing this for 10 years!By the way, the music is horrible! You would think that for an MTV production they would have some great music to work-out to. I guess you could use the instructor voice music off feature and put on your own stuff in the background, but this whole DVD is so bad that wouldn't help.Try these other DVD's instead:MTV Yoga (Wonderful for Extreme Beginners)American Power Yoga, Strength (Great for All Levels)Baron Baptiste Live!

759887,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00009YXBK,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[20, 23]","Kristin McGee is an instructor at ""Crunch."" I love her yoga workouts because she is serious about yoga and makes each workout enjoyable while still challenging you to your limit! This is a fast-paced Ashtanga-style workout.An Ashtanga-style workout presents a series of postures that produce intense internal heat and purifying sweat to detoxify the organs and muscles. You will feel the improved circulation and no one will have to tell you to ""breathe deeply"" You will breathe deeply because you need to.This is definitely an advanced workout because it moves so fast, there is really no time to actually learn the moves. You have to know what the poses are and move very quickly from one to the other. This is quite the colorful workout. Not only are you outdoors with greenery in the background, there are red flowers, large red mats and blue/purple yoga mats.Some of the exercises you will be doing include:Sun SalutationsDownward Facing DogAwkward Chair (chair pose)Rotating TrianglePlank Push-UpForward BendWarrior StretchesStanding StretchesOn all Fours SeriesSeated Stretches & Forward BendsBackward BendTwists - Enter new levels of making yourself into a pretzel.Final RelaxationPilates for AbsThere were quite a few poses that were highly creative and that I've never seen in any yoga video before.If you are new to Yoga and Pilates, I can highly recommend the first MTV Yoga video to learn the poses. Then, try the Winsor Pilates videos. If you can make it through Accelerated Body Sculpting then the Pilates section at the end of this workout will not be that much of a challenge. It is a short section to tone and tighten, but the instructor expects you to know how to do all the Pilates moves and fairly quickly.While the cover says: ""We incorporate beginner, intermediate and advanced versions in one routine,"" the problem for beginners is going to be the frustration they feel at trying to not only learn the correct position, but keep balance and follow the ""poses"" in a fast sequence. Speed is going to be the problem. Yes, there are instructors for each level, but the speed is all the same for every level. I think it would have been amazing if they had taken this routine and made it more accessible to all levels. Say, have three different speeds, beginner, intermediate and advanced speed.Also, you don't hold poses like ""warrior"" for longer than a second. I would have liked to have spent more time on each pose, but if that is also your preference, then you will love the first MTV Yoga workout. This workout seems to be more about stamina and getting the body warmed up and burning calories.There are also some pretty intense balancing poses (dancing shiva) and strength poses (half and full wheel, imagine being on all fours upside down) that will give intermediate and advanced students some great challenges.For those who are advanced, this will be yoga heaven. I'm probably less than intermediate and I made it all the way to the end. I just was not doing all the poses to their full extent and many of the poses might take a year to learn properly. Yoga requires a lot of flexibility and this takes time.What I did notice was that I was stretching further than I've ever stretched before and this might have been due to the excellent warm-up sun salutation routine at the start.I look forward to future MTV workouts because I like the music they choose and the instruction is inspirational and the workout really gives you the results you are looking for.For this workout, you will need:Yoga Mat (no other yoga tools/blocks, etc. are needed)Comfortable tight fitting yoga outfit that sticks to you like glue, otherwise any loose clothing will get in the way of your speed. Jockey Activewear has some silky soft outfits that are perfect for this type of workout.Enjoy! This is a great challenge and the results are a calm mind, strong body and a powerful sense of accomplishment.Also look for MTV Pilates and MTV Yoga.

The music is cool, but it makes me feel like I'm in an aerobics class.The yoga session is about 40 min long with a 1-2 min into & a 3 min meditation at the end. There is an additional pilates for ab for 5 min after that.There were some great standing twists & seated twists & bends I don't normally see in most mainstream yoga dvds that felt great.It really moves so fast by the time you get into a pose, she's already going in to the next one during the sun salutations. I have 30 yoga dvds & been doing it for 4 years & I still couldn't keep up.There is almost no instruction, so don't buy this unless you have taken classes or own several beginner yoga dvds. This is only for people looking to use yoga for stretching/fitness only, not for being more aware of your body at all. The music is also wrong, there is plenty of trance, ambient or new age music like Enigma that would compliment yoga, not make you feel more jittery.",3,Rebecca Johnson wrote a great detailed Review,1139875200,"02 14, 2006",2006,1088,"['add', 'two', 'cents', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'telling', 'content', 'workout.The', 'layout', 'was', 'cool', 'two', 'girls', 'guy', 'helping', 'different', 'levels', 'music', 'cool', 'feel', ""'m"", 'aerobics', 'class.The', 'yoga', 'session', '40', 'min', 'long', '1-2', 'min', '3', 'min', 'meditation', 'end', 'additional', 'pilates', 'ab', '5', 'min', 'were', 'great', 'standing', 'twists', 'seated', 'twists', 'bends', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'see', 'most', 'mainstream', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'felt', 'great.It', 'really', 'so', 'fast', 'time', 'get', 'pose', 'already', 'going', 'next', 'one', 'sun', 'salutations', 'have', '30', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'been', 'doing', '4', 'years', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up.There', 'almost', 'instruction', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'have', 'taken', 'classes', 'own', 'several', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'dvds', 'only', 'people', 'looking', 'use', 'yoga', 'stretching/fitness', 'only', 'not', 'being', 'more', 'aware', 'body', 'music', 'also', 'wrong', 'plenty', 'trance', 'ambient', 'new', 'age', 'music', 'Enigma', 'would', 'compliment', 'yoga', 'not', 'make', 'feel', 'more', 'jittery']",MTV Power Yoga
