1471143,A3NE5KEHD57Q6S,B005LAIHPE,"Admiralu ""admiralu""","[0, 0]","I saw Battleship in the theaters earlier this year. 6 times. I love this movie. It is my favorite film next only to the Avengers. I thought this was better than Men in Black III. Since many have already reviewed the plot, I am going to share some of my favorite moments and tidbits. Director Peter Berg is a Navy fan and it shows. Battleship has outstanding Transformer style special effects, lots of action, a great cast and support of the Navy, which includes many naval personnel, both active duty, retired WW II & Vietnam vets and wounded warriors. (You must see Army Col. Greg Gadson, a real wounded warrior who lost his legs in Iraq, personally take on an alien warrior-he is one tough soldier!)You don't see many of the latter in save the world films. Taylor Kitsch is wonderful as Alex Hopper, our slacker turned hero and I love Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) as his responsible Navy Captain brother Stone. They have a nice vibe between them. Rihanna is absolutely bad ass as Navy gunner Raikes. She spent time with weapons training with a real gunner named Jacqueline and she modeled her performance partly on this tough young lady. You will see Jacqueline in the bonus specials. Brooklyn Decker is wonderful as Sam, Alex's girlfriend and physical therapist. The alien weapons are awesome (the first ship destroyers are designed to look like the pegs in the board game), both peg projectiles and the formidable shredders which eat metal and have a mind of their own. We humans are considered much of a threat until we directly provoke them. Time for the Navy to save the day! While we normally see aircraft carrier and fighters, it is great to see what a destroyer does and Director Berg does a great job of putting you in the action and making it easy to follow.Ignore the critics and the bad reviews. This is a great movie, with lots of action and humor. I have friends who didn't see it in theaters, rented it loved and now wished they had seen it during its initial run. Several of them bought it. One friend said it had more action than the Avengers. Sit back, relax and enjoy seeing the Navy save the world. This is a wonderful tribute to our veterans, active, wounded and retired.**************************************************************************************************************THERE IS A BONUS SCENE AT THE END OF THE CREDITS SET IN SCOTLAND. Many people didn't know about it or missed it. The digital copy includes subtitles and languages and the bonus scene.****************************************************************************************************************Some favorite scenes:Alex getting tazed after damaging a convenience store to get Sam a chicken burrito. Great comic skills from Taylor.Alex meeting Captain Nigata (TADANOBU ASANO, a famed Japanese actor-Thor fans, you know him as one of the Asgardian Warriors 3) during the soccer match. Nigata kicks him in the face, causing Alex a concussion and the loss of the game. This sets up the dynamic relationship between the two.During the Rimpac exercises (the Naval games that include 13 nations participate in) some great moments:Alex explaining the difference between a destroyer and a battleship (a destroyer is the Terminator, a battleship is a floating punching bag)The opening ceremony aboard the Might Mo, USS Missouri battleship (the cast and crew shot aboard the real Mighty Mo, including a rare opportunity to film the Mighty Mo out at sea (details in the great making of docs including a tour) with over 600 multinational sailors and WWII vetsA great contrasting scene showing the difference in approaches Stone and Alex use while speaking to their crews. Stone as commander encourages his crew to be safe and learn cooperation from other nations and ""Keep Charging."" Alex as tactical action officer informs his crew to crush the enemy and outperform every other ship during the exercises. Watch the faces of the crew during Alex's speech when he says ""We are not here in this weapons room to learn."" Priceless looks from some of the real Navy sailors!When the Navy encounters the aliens and the action begins, note the care shown to include reactions from the sailors, they have some of the greatest reactions during the battles. ""Who's running the ship? Hopper. Hopper is, we are all going to die?!"" When a helmsman is steering the ship in a dangerous area, ""Ordy, we are about to kiss these rocks, man! I can see fish man!""Alex in command of the John Paul Jones after the CO and XO are killed insisting on charging the overwhelming power of the aliens that costs Nigata his ship and the loss of the Sampson and brother Stone, being reminded by Petty Officer ""Beast,"" (a great John Tui) that there are sailors in the water who need to be rescued.Key section in which Alex and Nigata begin to work together (their dynamic, contrasting styles help drive the film) while plotting their next move. When Nigata explains his water displacement strategy ""seeing them without seeing them"" Alex steps back and offers Nigata his chair, showing how much he has learned. Raikes (Rhianna) and other crew members give him questioning looks and he says ""My brother would have done the same."" One of my favorite scenes in the whole film. Watch the crew reactions as they first question and then rejoice in Nigata's clever usage of water displacement (like the battleship board game) to take out 2 alien ships.Destroyer John Paul Jones' destruction of the the third alien ship, which in turn sends out shredders to rip up the JPJ. Incredible special effects showing the shredders ripping the ship to pieces!A truly great scene where the survivors of the JPJ board the Might Mo. Beast says the ship is 70 years old with steam engines that he doesn't know how to run. There is a great view of the veteran sailors around the ship who come forward and step up once again when asked to fight. Great patriotic moment. I saw this on Memorial Day and the folks in the audience applauded. The Mighty Mo still packs a punch and it is worth it to see her take on the last alien ship and win. Another great section. Alex references the Art of War (a legendary Chinese guide to war strategy) several times during the film. Near the end he realizes the last confrontation reminds him of a section of Art of War. When the Mighty Mo defeats the alien ship, I love the exchange with Nigata.Nigata, ""I can't believe that worked!"" Alex, ""Art of War, after all these years it finally clicked! Fight the enemy where they aren't."" Nigata, ""That's not what that means!"" Alex, ""Really?"" Nigata, ""Not even close!""Buy the ticket and take the ride. A number of reviewers on iTunes were surprised at the amount of action and enjoyed it as well. I think you will enjoy this fun film. I am sorry we won't get to see further adventures of Alex Hopper.",5,Intense Action Thrill Ride with Heart,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,6817,"['saw', 'Battleship', 'theaters', 'earlier', 'year', '6',

1471144,A39633CU9DC0PY,B005LAIHPE,"A. J. Minhas ""althotos""","[0, 0]","When this came out in the movie theaters in early summer of 2012, I wanted to go see it, but a plethora of negative reviews persuaded me otherwise. I've been trying to purchase this DVD on eBay for months at a ""reasonable"" price. On Cyber Monday, Amazon came to the rescue with a half off deal on the DVD-Blue Ray combo. I watched it last night.The premise for aliens, who can travel light years across the galaxy, but cannot avoid crashing into one of our satellites and losing their only means of communications is a bit ridiculous. They resort to confiscating our telecommunications equipment, which supposedly can work with their super-advanced technology? Hello? Then, the battleships that traveled half-way across the galaxy can only skim across the ocean? There only armaments appear to be these mortar shells, which they lob at our ships and ironically resemble the pegs from the old battleship game. Hello? Where are the advanced projectile weapons and the energy beams and particle weapons? So, if you can ignore all this silliness, then you can sit back and enjoy the explosions and the special effects.If you want good, entertaining sci-fi with lots of action, get Avengers. If you want to watch the best movie of the year, get The Dark Knight Rises (latest Batman movie), which I pre-ordered weeks ago.

But when I start looking for reasons to get up and walk around while the movie's playing, something's wrong. For Battleship, it was the complete lack of realism in how the Navy was portrayed. I'm retired Navy and from an accuracy perspective, this was junk. Here's why:Screw-ups like Alex Hopper would NOT be assigned as Tactical Action Officer (TAO) on an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The level of responsibility is too great. (Aegis ships are breeding grounds for type A personalities.)CIWS does not make a 'wee wee' sound when it fires. When CIWS fires, IT SHAKES THE WHOLE SHIP. (And CIWS, as I recall, was being phased-out for the Rolling Airframe Missile system.)You can't light off seven boilers on a steam-propelled battleship and expect to be underway in less than two hours (by the movie's timeline)...not happening.There is NO (ZERO, ZIP, NADA, ZILCH) live 16-inch ammunition on the MO (USS Missouri) in Pearl Harbor.

Stupid.I know I'm nitpicking. And most of the time, I can overlook stuff like this if the story is engaging and it seems like the movie makers were at least trying. Not this one. The acting was fine and the cinematography was great. But Battleship is not only mindless from an entertainment perspective, it's mindless from a credibility perspective, as well.

Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[0, 0]","Stay with me on this one and ask yourself upon reading my review whether you've ever &#34;been there, done that&#34;  --- here's the situation, you have the remote in hand and you go through the movie channels looking for something interesting and some get your attention and you watch it [or part of it anyway if it turns out to be a bomb] or you move on to another channel. So I'm doing this and the moment I click on the satellite channel, there are some guys [in today's USN uniforms] in a small boat and I see the Japanese guy [wearing his Japanese uniform of today] say, &#34;What do you want us to do, Hopper, we have no ships left!&#34; and this Hopper guy responds, &#34;We have .... ONE&#34; and he glances at the venerable &#34;floating battleship museum&#34;, the USS Missouri, whereupon the Japanese guy says, &#34;Are you crazy? That's a museum!&#34; and Hopper says, &#34;Not today it's not!&#34; The scene and the lines got my attention so I continued to watch it and, cutting to the chase, once I saw that the &#34;enemy&#34; was out of space aliens, I was ready to move on but I hesitated ... and I'm glad I did! While I can't say that I'm a great fan of sci-fi movies [although there are exceptions], the stunning Blu-Ray quality and clarity of the movie and the special effects were 'so' good that I stayed with it, aliens from space or no aliens from space as the opposing force!Then I looked at the thing psychologically --- is it not true that as adults we make a trade-off, yes? We KNOW that virtually ALL movies are basically cinematic &#34;set-ups&#34; with a script, actors, cameras, cuts, directors, extras, etc. etc. ==but== we get into the thing because we are willing to suspend reality for a set period of time in order to be entertained! Think about that! BTW, this is precisely why 'some' directors INSIST in their contract that if they are in charge of the movie, they do NOT want any &#34;The making of ..... &#34; features as some claim that their efforts in creating the &#34;grand illusion&#34; [especially with an good script and excellent actors] is then ruined! It's somewhat akin to various directors who frowned 'mightily' when the colorization process started some years ago of classic B&W; films but it died out because of the the resulting criticism from those who made the film! Anyway, back to the Battleship movie, first it had the full cooperation of the US Navy and could film scenes on government owned ships and get the reality input of 'real' Navy personnel and, again, I found the special effects so outstanding that this alone was a compelling reason to watch the whole movie. I thought the casting was good too and you would never know that the real-life double amputee LTC in the film had never acted previously but I thought he was excellent in the role he played. The action is non stop and once you get used to the idea that the &#34;enemy&#34; are out of space aliens, well, hey, action is action!You can't go wrong with the price either for which you get a standard DVD disc, a Blu-Ray disc [with excellent Blu-Ray remastering for those high definition pics] and there are film extras including &#34;the making of ...&#34; kind of thing and cast interviews. There are some humorous scenes here and there [the chicken burrito thing, etc.] but overall it's an interesting watch and those special effects rather neat. I also liked and appreciated the film going out of its way to pay tribute to the 'real' military personnel and giving film parts to real military people or that one great scene where former real life crew members of the USS Missouri come by and the leader of the Navy Veterans says, &#34;What do you need,son?&#34; , and Hopper says, &#34;We need to borrow your boat.&#34;Doc Tony",5,I liked it but a confession follows ...,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",2014,3759,"['Stay', 'one', 'ask', 'reading', 'review', ""'ve"", 'ever', '34', 'been', 'there', 'done', '34', 'here', 'situation', 'have', 'remote', 'hand', 'go', 'movie', 'channels', 'looking', 'something', 'interesting', 'get', 'attention', 'watch', 'part', 'anyway', 'out', 'be', 'bomb', ']', 'move', 'channel', ""'m"", 'doing', 'moment', 'click', 'satellite', 'channel', 'are', 'guys', '[', 'today', 'USN', 'uniforms', ']', 'small', 'boat', 'see', 'Japanese', 'guy', '[', 'wearing', 'Japanese', 'uniform', 'today', ']', 'say', '34', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'do', 'Hopper', 'have', 'ships', 'left', '34', 'Hopper', 'guy', 'responds', '34', 'have', 'ONE', '34', 'venerable', '34', 'floating', 'battleship', 'museum', '34', 'USS', 'Missouri', 'whereupon', 'Japanese', 'guy', '34', 'Are', 'crazy', 'museum', '34', 'Hopper', '34', 'Not', 'today', 'not', '34', 'scene', 'lines', 'got', 'attention', 'so', 'continued', 'watch', 'cutting', 'chase', 'once', 'saw', '34', 'enemy', '34', 'was', 'space', 'aliens', 'was', 'ready', 'move', 'hesitated', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', ""'m"", 'great', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'movies', '[', 'are', 'exceptions', ']', 'stunning', 'Blu-Ray', 'quality', 'clarity', 'movie', 'special', 'effects', 'were', ""'so"", 'good', 'stayed', 'space', 'aliens', 'space', 'opposing', 'force', 'Then', 'looked', 'thing', 'psychologically', 'not', 'true', 'adults', 'make', 'trade-off', 'yes', 'KNOW', 'virtually', 'movies', 'are', 'basically', 'cinematic', '34', 'set-ups', '34', 'script', 'actors', 'cameras', 'cuts', 'directors', 'extras', 'etc', 'etc', '==but==', 'get', 'thing', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'reality', 'set', 'period', 'time', 'order', 'be', 'entertained', 'Think', 'BTW', 'precisely', 'why', ""'some"", 'directors', 'INSIST', 'contract', 'are', 'charge', 'movie', 'do', 'NOT', 'want', '34', 'making', '..', '34', 'features', 'claim', 'efforts', 'creating', '34', 'grand', 'illusion', '34', '[', 'especially', 'good', 'script', 'excellent', 'actors', ']', 'then', 'ruined', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'various', 'directors', 'who', 'frowned', ""'mightily"", 'when', 'colorization', 'process', 'started', 'years', 'classic', 'B', 'W', 'films', 'died', 'out', 'resulting', 'criticism', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'Anyway', 'back', 'Battleship', 'movie', 'first', 'had', 'full', 'cooperation', 'US', 'Navy', 'could', 'film', 'scenes', 'government', 'owned', 'ships', 'get', 'reality', 'input', ""'real"", 'Navy', 'personnel', 'again', 'found', 'special', 'effects', 'so', 'outstanding', 'alone', 'was', 'compelling', 'reason', 'watch', 'whole', 'movie', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'real-life', 'double', 'amputee', 'LTC', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'previously', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'role', 'played', 'action', 'non', 'stop', 'once', 'get', 'used', 'idea', '34', 'enemy', '34', 'are', 'space', 'aliens', 'well', 'hey', 'action', 'action', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'price', 'either', 'get', 'standard', 'DVD', 'disc', 'Blu-Ray', 'disc', '[', 'excellent', 'Blu-Ray', 'remastering', 'high', 'definition', 'pics', ']', 'are', 'film', 'extras', 'including', '34', 'making', '34', 'kind', 'thing', 'cast', 'interviews', 'are', 'humorous', 'scenes', 'here', 'there', '[', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'thing', 'etc', ']', 'overall', 'interesting', 'watch', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'neat', 'also', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'film', 'going', 'way', 'pay', 'tribute', ""'real"", 'military', 'personnel', 'giving', 'film', 'parts', 'real', 'military', 'people', 'one', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'former', 'real', 'life', 'crew', 'members', 'USS', 'Missouri', 'come', 'leader', 'Navy', 'Veterans', '34', 'What', 'do', 'need', 'son', '34', 'Hopper', '34', 'need', 'borrow', 'boat.', '34', 'Doc', 'Tony']",N/A

1471185,A2YKRLLZNJ3Q8P,B005LAIHPE,Arch Stanton,"[3, 6]","I'm amazed at the stupidity of this movie. To explain why, I'm going to describe the first few minutes of the film. At the very beginning they explain how we built an entire radio array in 2006 (which will later turn out to be a radar station, because they're clearly the same thing) to contact the sole extrasolar planet within habitable range of its sun (how many radio arrays do we already have operating?). This is followed by a radio transmission in the form of a burst of energy like a phaser beam being sent out of this array via a satellite. I already knew I would hate this film.Then to impress a girl at a bar the main character breaks into a convenience store in what's supposed to be an amusing scene set to the Pink Panther theme. Against all probability he succeeds in winning the girl with this stupid immaturity. So then his brother signs him up for the navy. Which is funny, 'cause I didn't know brothers could do that. Maybe I'll enlist mine just for kicks. The rest of the film is supposed to be him getting over this immaturity, but after such a stupid display the character has used up every smidgeon of the sympathy we naturally feel for main characters. At one point he's actually trying to get his crew killed in a suicidal attack because his brother died and he wants revenge.Taylor Kitsch demonstrates the acting talent that makeJohn Cartersuch an unbridled commercial success. He's believable neither as the mature sailor nor the immature man-child. About the only thing he can sell right is cocky incompetent. And he still gets the girl. Whoop. The moral here (as in far too many other movies of late) is that spoiled, idiot, immature boys with no self-control offer a vital dose of much needed passion into the impersonal and formal environments of modern society, and worse, that they can actually perform when it comes to crunch-time. Why Hollywood thinks we need this lesson is beyond me.I will admit that over time I found Kitsch's obvious effort and passion charming, but it's the kind of feeling you get for a drugged puppy repeatedly walking into a wall. And it just isn't enough. Liam Neeson is in this film too. He has an atrocious gung ho American accent. There's not that much more to say about him since he spends the entire film on the wrong side of an alien force field. Genghis Khan gives probably the best performance in the film. Rihanna isn't actually that bad as a naval officer with no role. She certainly didn't deserve that Razzie. Everyone else is pretty unmemorable. The girlfriend and her entire plot features the worst acting in the film, except possibly for Peter Nicols who overplays an incompetent Secretary of Defense.The aliens are impossibly inconsistent. When the plot decides they want them dead they're incredibly weak, yet the rest of the time the Navy's full firepower can't touch 'em. Also, they don't shoot at anyone who doesn't attack them, unless they do. And there was a big revelation I kept waiting for that would have explained the alien motivations along with why they didn't kill certain key people. But nope. Just a stereotypical psychic flash of explosions and conquests from when Kitsch looked into an alien's eyes.Cinematically this film is all over the place. It makes a massive overuse of the 'rapidly slow down/speed up zoom in/zoom out' camera movements. The efforts that they go to to match up with the game are amusing.

Funny, I don't remember any space aliens being in the game.Anyway . . . .The movie deals with a thought that has been kicked around in the past few years: in our desire to contact alien civilizations . . . is that really such a good idea? The underlying assumption is that if they are technologically advanced enough to receive our transmissions, then they must be benevolent, right? I mean, just look at us, we have the technology to create atomic bombs and human beings are benevolent, right?Riiiiight.The movie more or less begins with a disheveled loser being tasered for breaking and entering and a few months later, he is not only in the navy, but an officer.Riiiiight.Then, at the same time, there is a 15 nation naval war game going on near Pearl Harbor, Hawaii---of which, inexplicably, only Japan and the US are involved (beginning as rivals, then ultimately cooperate. FIRE THE SYMBOLISM CANNON: KABOOM!!).Anyway . . . .Aliens arrive in behemoth transports near Hawaii, land in the ocean and set up shop. They put up a force field that keeps everything out. Three alien dreadnoughts appear. Three destroyers are already inside the dome and two are dispatched quickly (one of them being the Japanese one) when they attack the aliens. As long as one does not attack the aliens they pretty much ignore you, except for the forces in Hawaii, where this rule doesn't seem to apply. The loser officer becomes captain when the ship's former captain gets killed and he shapes up in time for the struggle. The aliens are humanoid, of course, with hands, eyes and even teeth and tongue, which makes you wonder when are we going to ever come across a truly alien alien.The special effects are great and so are the battle scenes and they will keep you interested and excited and oblivious to the obvious blunders (except for the in-your-face blunders, like the black guy with no legs beating up an armored, weaponed, alien.

These two are EXTREMELY awful, seriously.However, almost out of nowhere (much to my personal satisfaction) suddenly 4-5 spacecrafts appear on radar and... guess where they're heading?  Why of course, planet Earth!  Wouldn't be very fun to have them crash on Venus would it?  Anyway, they blow an explosive hole through the atomsphere upon impact, destroying satellites in the process.  From here... well, what's the name of the movie?  Battleship.  This means several Naval officers are on ships in the middle of the ocean and forced to deal with these invading creatures.  Explosion after explosion, it's nonstop excitement.  Both sides constantly trading attacks back and forth... I was worried even MORE of these spaceships would appear!The aliens themselves aren't portrayed the way we've seen in several other films.  In fact they're drastically 100% different!  They almost resemble monkeys in the face, and aren't nearly as threatening without their spaceships.  That is, when the one Naval officer eventually finds one temporarily down and out and takes his helmet off.  This is when we finally see them.  I always love the suspense here.  What WILL they look like?My favorite segments are the one that show this giant destructive spinning ball made of blades storming off the spaceships and tearing up everything in its path.  This is downright *awesome*.  Why not tear up the little league kid playing ball, though?  Because that would be downright mean!  I couldn't help but compare these spinning balls to the legendary one and only Samus Aran (video game fans know what I'm referring to here, hehe, especially Metroid Prime lovers!)  Of course Samus can't rip things apart in her ball form... oh well.  Comparable enough!My only grip (other than the severely lackluster story-less 30 minutes in the beginning) are all the heavy metal/alternative rock songs.  They sort of diminish the action-packed storytelling and make the alien invasion concept seem significantly less serious.  I mean come ON!  Aliens are invading Earth!  Loud music doesn't really make these scenes any better in my opinion- tacky instead.  The AC/DC music near the end is really unnecessary (despite the song being great of course, because AC/DC is a great band!)  Overall, wonderful movie for science fiction lovers.",4,so many spaceship explosions!,1360368000,"02 9, 2013",2013,2673,"['Battleship', 'while', 'warm', 'up', 'first', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'think', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'judging', 'solely', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'dominated', 'WAY', 'too', 'much', 'pointless', 'attempts', 'humor', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'involving', 'Naval', 'officer', 'bathroom', 'scene', 'probably', 'worst', 'how', 'burrito/taser', 'gun', 'segment', 'two', 'are', 'EXTREMELY', 'awful', 'seriously.However', 'almost', 'nowhere', 'much', 'personal', 'satisfaction', 'suddenly', '4-5', 'spacecrafts', 'appear', 'radar', 'guess', 'where', ""'re"", 'heading', 'Why', 'course', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'very', 'fun', 'have', 'crash', 'Venus', 'would', 'Anyway', 'blow', 'explosive', 'hole', 'atomsphere', 'upon', 'impact', 'destroying', 'satellites', 'process', 'here', 'well', 'what', 'name', 'movie', 'Battleship', 'several', 'Naval', 'officers', 'are', 'ships', 'middle', 'ocean', 'forced', 'deal', 'invading', 'creatures', 'Explosion', 'explosion', 'nonstop', 'excitement', 'sides', 'constantly', 'trading', 'attacks', 'back', 'forth', 'was', 'worried', 'even', 'MORE', 'spaceships', 'would', 'appear', 'aliens', 'are', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'way', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'films', 'fact', ""'re"", 'drastically', '100', '%', 'different', 'almost', 'resemble', 'monkeys', 'face', 'are', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'threatening', 'spaceships', 'when', 'one', 'Naval', 'officer', 'eventually', 'one', 'temporarily', 'down', 'helmet', 'off', 'when', 'finally', 'see', 'always', 'love', 'suspense', 'here', 'What', 'look', 'favorite', 'segments', 'are', 'one', 'show', 'giant', 'destructive', 'spinning', 'ball', 'made', 'blades', 'storming', 'off', 'spaceships', 'tearing', 'up', 'everything', 'path', 'downright', '*awesome*', 'Why', 'not', 'tear', 'up', 'little', 'league', 'kid', 'playing', 'ball', 'though', 'would', 'be', 'downright', 'mean', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', 'spinning', 'balls', 'legendary', 'one', 'only', 'Samus', 'Aran', 'video', 'game', 'fans', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'referring', 'here', 'hehe', 'especially', 'Metroid', 'Prime', 'lovers', 'course', 'Samus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rip', 'things', 'apart', 'ball', 'form', 'oh', 'well', 'Comparable', 'enough', 'My', 'only', 'grip', 'other', 'severely', 'lackluster', 'story-less', '30', 'minutes', 'beginning', 'are', 'heavy', 'metal/alternative', 'rock', 'songs', 'sort', 'diminish', 'action-packed', 'storytelling', 'make', 'alien', 'invasion', 'concept', 'seem', 'significantly', 'less', 'serious', 'mean', 'come', 'ON', 'Aliens', 'are', 'invading', 'Earth', 'Loud', 'music', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'scenes', 'better', 'opinion-', 'tacky', 'instead', 'AC/DC', 'music', 'end', 'really', 'unnecessary', 'song', 'being', 'great', 'course', 'AC/DC', 'great', 'band', 'Overall', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'science', 'fiction', 'lovers']",N/A

Battleship starts off with a great piece of humor as the main character, Hopper, breaks into a convenient store to get a woman a chicken burrito. Fed up with his lack of direction in life, Hopper's brother forces him to join the movie. Skip a year to two later and Hopper is not a Lieutenant in the Navy and stationed on a Destroyer in Hawaii. Then the aliens come.Some of you might think that this is just another alien invasion movie where humans must defend themselves from annihilation. Though the plot line is similar, Battleship is still different. To me this was a story about accepting change and growing up with the alien invasion as a backdrop. Hopper is a very immature character when you meet him at first. When the aliens arrive in Hawaii and destroy most of the Naval fleet stationed there, he is suddenly left in command of a very cr*ppy situation. He has to figure out how to rally what is left of his crew to fight, discover the aliens' weak point, and destroy them before they can call for help. This horrific incident forces Hopper to grow up and learn what it is he's made of. That is something very few people ever get to learn.There is another character in the movie who is a Army Lieutenant that lost both of his legs while fighting overseas. When you meet him he is angry at that and feels incomplete and useless. When the aliens arrive, the man learns that even without his legs, he quite capable of putting up a fight. He hikes up to where the aliens built a communications array with two other people, to destroy it. He learns to accept the loss of his legs, but also discovers that he has more than just physical strength. He has courage and the willingness to do what needs to be done.Another thing I love about this movie, is that it paints the U.S. Military in a positive light. It shows men and women putting their lives on the line to defend everyone else. There is also a scene where Hopper and his crew join with a bunch of retired Navy soldiers, all of whom are in the 60s or older, to navigate the USS Missouri, which currently serves a museum, out into the open water. They then use the decommissioned ship to obliterate the alien warship. I thought it was a nice touch because it pays tribute all who have served in the military.Battleship has a lot of explosive action and won't let you down on that score. There are plenty of scenes with the main characters going toe to toe with these armored aliens. There is also a good amount of humor mixed in to break up the intense action sequences.

Well for reasons unknown the Aliens reason for coming to earth is not at all defined. We know that one ship lands on an Island of the Hawaiian kind to set up satellites to call in other ships, or so the characters assume, but they really seem like prospectors. Their ships are big, but they lack for any real apocalyptic armaments other then then outside canons and these rollers with spikes which would seem to indicate that they are in the mining business. And these wheels are like their digging machines. Their ship really seem made for cargo transport then battle.Their technology differentiates between friend, schooner or yacht and possible foe battleship and they never fire on civilians only the obviously armed Battleships.  I think we fired first, but the plot hole is why they did not try any attempt at communication as to their intentions which may have only meant mining, perhaps for some materials that their technology could reach and maybe it was more of a supply gathering splashdown. Maybe they needed alloys for repair. Anything. But all we do is open fire. Back and forth and a bunch of silly dialogue in-between. Was Liam Neeson hard up for a check?

He has to lead the crew and fight against aliens out to take over the world. The story has a couple of different aspects, but for the most part it was about the special effects and action sequences, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

If you killed a roach, then saw a second roach, you would know it was a roach.6) If the guy can break into the satellite station to get a radio, why can he not just turn off the satellites, or redirect them?7) why do the aliens carry no weapons, except a hammer/sword thing?8) In the 1 hour trip to the North side of the Island, The captain on the destroyer could not take the time to lock onto the Radar dishes and destroy them?9) After being fired on twice by the enemy (with major damage), the Navy ships still only fire single shots at them with their main gun. Why not open fire with everything? It is a Destroyer, right? And we see what opening fire, can do to the enemy later. Pretty effective.10) Why are the enemy soldiers bulletproof, but the ships are not?11) How do the aliens fit into their armor?

Be sure to skip the first 30 pointless minutes of this movie, when they introduce a bunch of shallow characters that barely do anything, a pointless side plot, and play soccer. Anyway, their trip goes wrong when their communications ship slams into a satellite and burns up in the atmosphere (I guess their steering wheel was broken), and they land in the ocean to be greeted by our esteemed US Navy. Unfortunately Earth is the last place they should have visited. This movie is delivered on the surface as a typical alien invasion movie. Under the surface, there is nothing aggressive or dominating about the aliens at all. They try to land near the source of the signal we sent, try to communicate with our Naval ships, and are promptly shot at.What follows is a series of aggression on the part of an incompetent military that shoots first and asks questions later. The aliens, almost reluctantly, destroy our ships and create a giant shield around Hawaii so they can phone home. No doubt to say, ""Help! These people are nuts!!""You spend the entire movie feeling sorry for the poor aliens. Especially when being attacked by a bunch of military misfits. A confused young man who cries at his post because he doesn't know what to do during battle. A slacker who somehow manages to end up in command of his own ship, and then promptly orders them to ram the aliens and kill everyone. They are saved of course by a Japanese commander and a bunch of 80 year old retired naval officers who are the only ones in this movie who seem to know what they are doing. Why the Navy thought this was a good movie to support, I have no idea.Throughout the film, the aliens do everything they can to protect themselves and avoid killing the natives. They go out of their way to rescue one of their own without hurting anyone else. They risk boarding the ship to disable it rather than destroy it, which they could have easily done. Their weapons are primitive and ineffective for a interstellar travelers. The mechanical suits they wear don't have any weapons at all. At the end of the movie, the aliens are destroyed and our protagonists all get medals. I really feel like this was a different movie that was gutted in the editing room and changed with a slap-on new ending. At least at the end of Independence Day, you felt like the aliens deserved it. At the end of this movie, I felt like we just killed a stray puppy and paraded it's dead body down Main Street.Oh, and just to justify the name of the movie, there's a scene where they blindly lob shells at each other on a Battleship grid.

1471251,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B005LAIHPE,Chris Kennison,"[3, 5]","Finally, a summer without Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, but in its place we get Peter Berg's ""Battleship"". By the end of this review, I hope to get across that I think that's a good thing. ""Battleship"" is big, silly and flawed, but while I say that, it is certainly a worthy addition to the summer blockbuster rollout. It may be facing an uphill battle against ""The Avengers"", ""The Amazing Spiderman"", ""Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Prometheus"", but it shouldn't be overlooked as a fun trip to the movies.To make matters worse, ""Battleship"" was wedged right between the billion dollar ""Avengers"" and another anticipated movie coming out next week, ""Men in Black 3"". Yet, what Peter Berg understands about making movies is that people really register with personality and humanity, which ""Battleship"" has in spades.Taylor Kitsch (John Carter) plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper, a loose cannon, unpredictable, Maverick from ""Top Gun"" kind of character. You get the gist of his personality in the very first scene we meet him as he takes going that extra mile for a girl to a whole new level. Brooklyn Decker plays Samantha Shane, a girl who just wants a chicken burrito and Hopper is out to impress. That scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie.""Battleship"" knows what it is. It is big and silly. The comedy is frequent and the comedy, for the most part, works. Yet, when the trouble occurs, the creators have done their job and we feel the urgency and peril in their dilemma. As aliens from a similar planet from a distance galaxy explode into our atmosphere, bent on taking over, the trouble grows thick and it grows fast. You feel the overwhelming and seemingly invincible nature of the invaders.Peter Berg knows that people relate to people, not explosions and he puts the comradery and humanity of the navy officers on full display. ""Battleship"" isn't trying to be serious. It knows it's big and crazy. A perfect example is the one element of the film where the U.S.S. Missouri, docked for museum purposes, is recommissioned along with the elderly veterans that inhabit it. Still, not only is this an entertaining wrinkle, it is also pretty cool seeing the filmmakers refer to the U.S.S. Missouri as the quality vessel that it is. Not to mention, seeing the elderly veterans talking trash about their battleship.""Battleship"" is a fun movie. It reminded me of ""Top Gun"", ""Hunt for Red October"", & ""Crimson Tide"" with aliens and comedy thrown in. It is a worthy summer movie and I hope that people do go see it, so that Hollywood knows that we like personality, humanity and story with our explosions.

In hind sight, this was a really stupid decision! I carefully watched all of the ads and purchased the brand new Battleship 2012 the day it became available. Even then, I found Amazon.com to have the best price on this product. I received it in less than the two days expected and in excellent condition, of course.My wife and I sat down, with a big bowl of popcorn, and watched this movie without even a bathroom pause. We didn't want to miss a second of this film. Yes, I know we can pause it, but it's just not the same, do you know what I mean? The time went by in a flash and the next thing we knew, we were looking at the credits. For a few seconds we just sat there, then looked at each other and said, ""That movie was outrageously crazy fun! Let's watch it again."" To say we were very pleasantly surprised at the acting, writing, overall plot with superior special effects, even throwing in a good 5 minutes or more of them actually fighting the aliens by playing the original form of Battleship the game, is a gross understatement.I can't figure out how a movie like this can get panned so badly by the alleged critics, appear to bomb at the box office and yet when we watch it, the film is outstanding. Do these critics not have an imagination or have any fun in life? The premise is somewhat predictable, so big deal. Like stupid humans we send a powerful radio beam message to another planet inviting them here. As stated by one to the science people, if this is successful it will be like the Indians sending a message inviting the Conquistadors and the more advanced societies always win. Meaning, we are the Indians. By this time we're saying, ""No .... kidding."" Sure enough this very advanced civilization of aliens come to Earth and it's not to play Hazbro board games either. Then the fun really begins.This movie is nothing but visual candy for the sci-fi adventure people, especially if you enjoyed the ""Transformers"" series. It's appropriate for just about any age as there is a lack of bad language, violence or blood and gore, all while teaching the lessons of thinking out of the box and good wins out over evil. The bottom line to us was, if Liam Neesan was playing a major role, this was going to be a quality movie and we were not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie as a multi-watch quality product appropriate for the entire family.

Sawin,"[21, 39]","Do you remember that scene in ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" Where Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are hiding in the women's restroom as those two women play ""battle sh--s"" with one another? It was not only expected that that scene would be better than the 131 minute duration of ""Battleship"", but the way that scene possibly smelled would also be like a bed of roses in comparison. Brought to you by Hasbro, the company that brought us ""Transformers"" is a movie that looks like it's trying so hard to be exactly what you've already seen in those three blockbuster movies. The actual result is one thousand times worse than you can possibly imagine.For the first 45 minutes, you're left wondering where in the world is this movie the trailers hinted at? You're introduced to Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper, who appears to be still drinking off the failure of ""John Carter"". Alex is the stubborn rebel who never listens to anybody and flies by the seat of his pants except all of his decisions would be idiotic even to a ten year old. On his birthday, he is jobless, drinking with his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgrd), is shot in the back with a taser gun after breaking into a closed gas station food mart trying to obtain a chicken burrito to impress a buxom blonde named Sam (Brooklyn Decker), and is drafted to the Navy the following morning by Stone.If that wasn't enough, you're subjected to a game of soccer where Alex continues to be terrible at everything as he gets kicked in the face, misses a goal that would've sent the game into overtime, loses the nerve to request permission from Sam's father Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) about marrying Sam, and gets into a bathroom brawl with Japanese Captain Yugi Nagata (""Thor""'s Tadanobu Asano). Isn't this amazing, you guys? It's exactly like the board game you used to play growing up!Then the aliens arrive. You tried to contact alien life with groundbreaking technology and then you're surprised when you get a devastating response that could affect the world as we know it. Smooth. As they arrive, Peter Berg reveals just how much he looks up to Michael Bay as he tries to mimic every explosion, action sequence, and plot device the Californian director has become successful for. ""Battleship"" is a combination of ""Armageddon"", all of the ""Transformers"" movies, Halo, and James Cameron's ""Titanic"" as the main references to the board game lie within ammunition from the alien ships looking like game pegs and the entire ""water displacement"" scene being the actors playing the game itself on a huge screen. The line ""You sunk my battleship!"" is never uttered. They had to make room for a fist fight between a man with no legs and one of the aliens. Oh, if only that was meant to be a joke.The acting is really, really bad. Taylor Kitsch attempts to be the lovable idiot, but he comes off as more of a lite version of Keanu Reeves. This is also Rihanna's acting and feature film debut, but her character was only designed to state the obvious and verbalize sound effects (""BOOM!""). Hamish Linklater's entire performance seems to be inspired by Tom Green and Liam Neeson could only stomach having six or seven minutes of screen time despite how much money was thrown at him. It's like they cast Hawaiian natives and war veterans with no acting experience in many of the supporting roles.""Battleship"" wants to be ""Transformers"" so bad. The lame and juvenile attempts at humor are along the same lines as the humor everybody hated in ""Revenge of the Fallen"" that was crammed down your throat the majority of the movie. Its formula is even similar; aliens invade earth and destroy everything they can with a plan to overcome the Earth, a (bunch of) secondary character(s) dies that inspire the main cast, the once thought useless character becomes useful, saves the day, and grows into a hero without learning a lesson but teaches the world to succumb to his reckless ways. The only difference is ""Battleship"" has this old man AC/DC montage that goes on entirely too long and they make a battleship drift out in the ocean that would impress anyone from the ""Fast & Furious"" franchise.""Battleship"" is just so awful every way you look at it. If you could somehow take out the entire first hour and the last fifteen minutes, and watch all of the action sequences on mute, it would still only be partially watchable. If the atrocious acting and mind numbingly familiar storyline weren't enough, the regurgitated attempt at recycling Michael Bay's success should be enough to send you running and screaming out of the theater. But the one question this terrible excuse of a movie does leave you with is just what could the number for humility actually be?",1,"""I have a bad feeling about this.""",1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,4724,"['Do', 'remember', 'scene', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'Where', 'Harold', 'John', 'Cho', 'Kumar', 'Kal', 'Penn', 'are', 'hiding', 'women', 'restroom', 'two', 'women', 'play', 'battle', 'sh', 's', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'expected', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'better', '131', 'minute', 'duration', 'Battleship', 'way', 'scene', 'possibly', 'smelled', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'bed', 'roses', 'comparison', 'Brought', 'Hasbro', 'company', 'brought', 'Transformers', 'movie', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'exactly', 'what', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'three', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'actual', 'result', 'one', 'thousand', 'times', 'worse', 'can', 'possibly', 'imagine.For', 'first', '45', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'left', 'wondering', 'where', 'world', 'movie', 'trailers', 'hinted', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Lieutenant', 'Alex', 'Hopper', 'who', 'be', 'still', 'drinking', 'off', 'failure', 'John', 'Carter', 'Alex', 'stubborn', 'rebel', 'who', 'never', 'anybody', 'flies', 'seat', 'pants', 'decisions', 'would', 'be', 'idiotic', 'even', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'birthday', 'jobless', 'drinking', 'brother', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'shot', 'back', 'taser', 'gun', 'breaking', 'closed', 'gas', 'station', 'food', 'mart', 'trying', 'obtain', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'impress', 'buxom', 'blonde', 'named', 'Sam', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'drafted', 'Navy', 'following', 'morning', 'Stone.If', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', ""'re"", 'subjected', 'game', 'soccer', 'where', 'Alex', 'be', 'terrible', 'everything', 'kicked', 'face', 'goal', 'would', ""'ve"", 'sent', 'game', 'overtime', 'nerve', 'request', 'permission', 'Sam', 'father', 'Admiral', 'Shane', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'marrying', 'Sam', 'bathroom', 'brawl', 'Japanese', 'Captain', 'Yugi', 'Nagata', 'Thor', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'guys', 'exactly', 'board', 'game', 'used', 'play', 'growing', 'up', 'Then', 'aliens', 'arrive', 'tried', 'contact', 'alien', 'life', 'groundbreaking', 'technology', 'then', ""'re"", 'surprised', 'when', 'get', 'devastating', 'response', 'could', 'affect', 'world', 'know', 'Smooth', 'arrive', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'up', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'mimic', 'explosion', 'action', 'sequence', 'plot', 'device', 'Californian', 'director', 'become', 'successful', 'Battleship', 'combination', 'Armageddon', 'Transformers', 'movies', 'Halo', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Titanic', 'main', 'references', 'board', 'game', 'lie', 'ammunition', 'alien', 'ships', 'looking', 'game', 'pegs', 'entire', 'water', 'displacement', 'scene', 'being', 'actors', 'playing', 'game', 'huge', 'screen', 'line', 'sunk', 'battleship', 'never', 'uttered', 'had', 'make', 'room', 'fist', 'fight', 'man', 'legs', 'one', 'aliens', 'Oh', 'only', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'joke.The', 'acting', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'attempts', 'be', 'lovable', 'idiot', 'off', 'more', 'lite', 'version', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'also', 'Rihanna', 'acting', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'character', 'was', 'only', 'designed', 'state', 'obvious', 'verbalize', 'sound', 'effects', 'BOOM', 'Hamish', 'Linklater', 'entire', 'performance', 'be', 'inspired', 'Tom', 'Green', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'could', 'only', 'stomach', 'having', 'six', 'seven', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'was', 'thrown', 'cast', 'Hawaiian', 'natives', 'war', 'veterans', 'acting', 'experience', 'many', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Battleship', 'be', 'Transformers', 'so', 'bad', 'lame', 'juvenile', 'attempts', 'humor', 'are', 'same', 'lines', 'humor', 'everybody', 'hated', 'Revenge', 'Fallen', 'was', 'crammed', 'down', 'throat', 'majority', 'movie', 'formula', 'even', 'similar', 'aliens', 'invade', 'earth', 'destroy', 'everything', 'can', 'plan', 'overcome', 'Earth', 'bunch', 'secondary', 'character', 'inspire', 'main', 'cast', 'once', 'thought', 'useless', 'character', 'useful', 'day', 'hero', 'learning', 'lesson', 'world', 'succumb', 'reckless', 'ways', 'only', 'difference', 'Battleship', 'old', 'man', 'AC/DC', 'montage', 'entirely', 'too', 'long', 'make', 'battleship', 'drift', 'ocean', 'would', 'impress', 'anyone', 'Fast', 'Furious', 'franchise', 'Battleship', 'just', 'so', 'awful', 'way', 'look', 'could', 'somehow', 'take', 'out', 'entire', 'first', 'hour', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'watch', 'action', 'sequences', 'mute', 'would', 'still', 'only', 'be', 'partially', 'watchable', 'atrocious', 'acting', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'regurgitated', 'attempt', 'recycling', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'success', 'should', 'be', 'enough', 'send', 'running', 'screaming', 'theater', 'one', 'question', 'terrible', 'excuse', 'movie', 'leave', 'just', 'what', 'could', 'number', 'humility', 'actually', 'be']",N/A

The film is probably OK for 10 - 12 year old boys, but that's about it. The actors give the impression that they are a.) reading their lines, and b.) cannot wait to be finished with the film. The plot is absurd (taking the USS Missouri out to sea and finding live WWII shells still on board). The Navy does not take boneheads off the street and make them into lieutenants, even if their older brother is a Lt. Cmdr. There are more than three officers on a destroyer, so when the CO and Exec are KIA there would be more than one officer and a handful of enlisted remaining in the crew. When a captain gives a command to a desron (destroyer squadron) he is not ordering the start of air operations.

Three times in a row to be exact,  and rewound to the most spellbinding authentic appearing and downright heart rending scenes too many times to count.After I invested my entire day with this BRILLIANT movie, I then went to Wikipedia to check on how it had done, etc. Well, folks, I was downright peeved. I still am! This movie did the WORST for a movie that cost what it did to produce. Are they NUTS whoever ""they"" are? I've had this on my wait list since I first learned of it - on the internet, by the way. Actually, via seeing a ""drop"" which is basically a 10 second commercial, on HULU likely, but I'm not sure. What I notice is this. I didn't see ANY other advertising for it - and wouldn't have located it had I not done my own searching for when it would be out.Now, with the movie industry making these massively costly boo boos for their box office, don't they get it? Don't they get the fact that most of us want to stay at home now and watch these newly released movies for MUCH less than going out to the theater and dropping a hundred bucks for all the concession nonsense as well as the cost of going? Look, film makers. We are in a real bad place here in the US financially, and yet these movies are still our outlet. Also, we who have a set income, have to limit our entertainment options - and there is much more now available via ROKU and the net. Heck, I haven't had cable for years since I found HULU. It rocks to have the option of watching what I want, when I want to watch it. Also, all the networks have gotten it apparently - because I can also watch CSI or whatever - and when I wish, via their website. Who, in the world, doesn't know this now? I don't know anyone.Back to BATTLESHIP! My point is simple. This movie is exceptional, as is another movie by the star, Taylor Kitsch who appears in this one - John Carter the movie. It didn't do well at all either - and I just happened on it. On Amazon, of course, and you should buy it too! You won't be sorry. So, all you who are making the mistake of paying any attention to other than what folks are sharing in this forum? Get over it and WATCH THIS MOVIE. BUY THIS MOVIE! BUY BATTLESHIP, pop some popcorn, get some Kit-Kats at Walmart and have fun! Be prepared to be proud of the USA. We are the greatest country on this earth...well, the best of the worst anyway! Anyway, Battleship is absolutely worth it. Now, I think I'm going to watch it again!!

I did not want to race out and see it again, I may never rent it (although Alexander Skaarsgaard sure was pretty).  So why 4 Stars? (Possible Spoilers after this, not that much in this movie is a Surprise)This movie did do a couple things really right from a sentimental point of view.  I am unabashedly a Pearl Harbor Patriot.  I own all the books on it and I cry at all the movies, and when I go an visit I am just a MESS!  I cry big cry, not little tears.  So I LOVED that they referenced the Veterans in this movie.I also loved that they had someone portraying a double amputee injured serviceman, and they did not make him someone you felt sorry for, thought it was great that they showed that he was still able to be a warrior.  That was FANTASTIC, and nice to see.The next thing I loved was and here is the Spoiler - last chance - that they made use of the Veterans that worked on the USS Missouri.  I loved them showing that just because people age, they are still useful, due to the knowledge they had.  Also - I loved that the Missouri opened up a huge can of whoop *ss on the aliens!!! Go Mighty MO!The other thing that I thought was great historically was being at Pearl Harbor and having us work with a Japanese captain to save the world.  It showed how far we have come since 1940's and our perspective and relations.So as you can tell for completely Sappy reasons, I gave this 4 Stars and not 5 because of the rest of the film which I will get into now.See it on the big screen because the cinematography awesome.  No way will your home theater due it justice, especially the panoramic ocean views.  I would go to a Matinee rather than full price.It was such a cliched story line with my exceptions above - super smart hot guy who is a bit of a screw up and enlists to straighten out, but then he is still a screw up that puts himself first, and is very selfish.  Let's his buddies down by being a ""Top Gun"" in his own mind.  Then (SPOILER) his brother dies (dang it, he is reason I went to see movie)  and conveniently every person with rank above him and he is thrust into being a Captain.  He still is thinking of only himself, but someone snaps him out of it and he starts leading - blah blah blah - pretty trite.They tried, but the dialog was just not as snappy or clever as was intended, and my biggest gripe - the inconceivability that they let his ship continue to exist!  So these super smart aliens have these awesome destructive balls that wipe out freeway overpasses and get rid of all the helicopters, yet they continue to let his ship float.  Just stupid.So with all that said, I enjoyed all the big blow em up stuff and effects - the aliens were morons for not killing off our tragic hero and Rhianna from the get go. Rhianna did ok - it was nice that they did not try to put her in a bikini or anything, and she did alright as a tough girl.  I would watch it at a Matinee if I knew then what I know now, and I would not purchase it on dvd/blu ray - because it just was not that great.  I liked it for totally sappy reasons that might not hold for everyone.On the other hand my Dad LOVED it - but he is secretly a 12 year old boy ;).",4,Basic Cookie Cutter Blockbuster with a couple nice notes,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,3226,"['So', 'went', 'Midnight', 'showing', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'OK', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'race', 'out', 'see', 'again', 'may', 'never', 'rent', 'Alexander', 'Skaarsgaard', 'sure', 'was', 'pretty', 'So', 'why', '4', 'Stars', 'Possible', 'Spoilers', 'not', 'much', 'movie', 'Surprise', 'movie', 'did', 'do', 'couple', 'things', 'really', 'right', 'sentimental', 'point', 'view', 'am', 'unabashedly', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Patriot', 'own', 'books', 'cry', 'movies', 'when', 'go', 'visit', 'am', 'just', 'MESS', 'cry', 'big', 'cry', 'not', 'little', 'tears', 'So', 'LOVED', 'referenced', 'Veterans', 'movie.I', 'also', 'loved', 'had', 'someone', 'portraying', 'double', 'amputee', 'injured', 'serviceman', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'someone', 'felt', 'sorry', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'showed', 'was', 'still', 'able', 'be', 'warrior', 'was', 'FANTASTIC', 'nice', 'see.The', 'next', 'thing', 'loved', 'was', 'here', 'Spoiler', 'last', 'chance', 'made', 'use', 'Veterans', 'worked', 'USS', 'Missouri', 'loved', 'showing', 'just', 'people', 'age', 'are', 'still', 'useful', 'due', 'knowledge', 'had', 'Also', 'loved', 'Missouri', 'opened', 'up', 'huge', 'can', 'whoop', '*ss', 'aliens', 'Go', 'Mighty', 'MO', 'other', 'thing', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'historically', 'was', 'being', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'having', 'work', 'Japanese', 'captain', 'save', 'world', 'showed', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', '1940', 'perspective', 'relations.So', 'can', 'tell', 'completely', 'Sappy', 'reasons', 'gave', '4', 'Stars', 'not', '5', 'rest', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'now.See', 'big', 'screen', 'cinematography', 'awesome', 'way', 'will', 'home', 'theater', 'due', 'justice', 'especially', 'panoramic', 'ocean', 'views', 'would', 'go', 'Matinee', 'rather', 'full', 'price.It', 'was', 'such', 'cliched', 'story', 'line', 'exceptions', 'super', 'smart', 'hot', 'guy', 'who', 'bit', 'screw', 'up', 'enlists', 'straighten', 'out', 'then', 'still', 'screw', 'up', 'first', 'very', 'selfish', 'Let', 'buddies', 'down', 'being', 'Top', 'Gun', 'own', 'mind', 'Then', 'SPOILER', 'brother', 'dies', 'dang', 'reason', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'conveniently', 'person', 'rank', 'thrust', 'being', 'Captain', 'still', 'thinking', 'only', 'someone', 'snaps', 'leading', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'pretty', 'trite.They', 'tried', 'dialog', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'snappy', 'clever', 'was', 'intended', 'biggest', 'gripe', 'inconceivability', 'let', 'ship', 'continue', 'exist', 'super', 'smart', 'aliens', 'have', 'awesome', 'destructive', 'balls', 'wipe', 'out', 'freeway', 'overpasses', 'get', 'rid', 'helicopters', 'yet', 'continue', 'let', 'ship', 'float', 'Just', 'stupid.So', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'big', 'blow', 'em', 'up', 'stuff', 'effects', 'aliens', 'were', 'morons', 'not', 'killing', 'off', 'tragic', 'hero', 'Rhianna', 'get', 'go', 'Rhianna', 'did', 'ok', 'was', 'nice', 'did', 'not', 'try', 'put', 'bikini', 'anything', 'did', 'alright', 'tough', 'girl', 'would', 'watch', 'Matinee', 'knew', 'then', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'would', 'not', 'purchase', 'dvd/blu', 'ray', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'liked', 'totally', 'sappy', 'reasons', 'might', 'not', 'hold', 'everyone.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Dad', 'LOVED', 'secretly', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy']",N/A

For example, some complain aliens couldn't have received the signal and got here in the time allotted. However, they don't know if our signal was intercepted by their equipment that is long off planet (like how we have tech that is floating to the outskits of our Solar System, or Mars) and then relayed by a much more advanced tech. They might have tech pretty close to us. Furthermore, those 5 ships could have been send from one of their outposts that are much closer to us. Anyways, just a couple ways to explain what the wannabe's can't comprehend.Some will complain that the aliens tech was not advanced enough. Well, we are sending tech to Mars and we are having to cross our fingers during the landing. Any race, any where, is going to have tech that is simply as advanced as they've taken it to date. People are just assuming because they are flying to another planet that their tech must be the ultimate of all tech ever imagined.And some more will complain how ""what went down"" didn't make sense when seen from the perspective of alien tech. They assume that because the aliens avoided non threatening humans that they must be here for peaceful purposes. However, if you are actually paying attention, you'll see the aliens are the aggressors from (even before) the beginning. Why did they avoid non threatening humans? Well, let's see. If humans were going to a new planet to take as their home, and there was food running around on it, would you kill all the food as soon as you got there?Just not so. These are usually childish little boys who only see or miss what they expected, and don't give a rats hiney about reality.Hi ArthurAll in all this movie was just okay. I can't comprehend how a studio can spend so much money then have such failures in their dialog. Of course - this could all be the editor's fault. The dialog could have been better, but this move was not about the dialog. I think the lead was a miscast. That guy is just not a good fit for a (any) lead role.The redeeming features of the film were seeing the old battleship in action (sure it wouldn't have had live artillery or been able to work, but really, who cares?), seeing a new type of alien and their tech. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but I don't regret giving it 3 stars. I'd say for sure RENT not buy. I hadn't seen a new movie in a while and this was not available for rent so I bought it for like $17 (pent of desire to see a new action flick) and I can honestly say I regret that.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[10, 14]","After seeing ""Battleship,"" the first thing I did was check IMDB to see if Michael Bay had directed, produced or written this lump of steaming, festering tripe.No, apparently Bay has fanboys who aspire to make the same kind of movies -- monstrous, overblown explosionfests that borderline fetishize the American military. Peter Berg isn't QUITE as bad as Bay, but that's like saying that a punch to the gut is less painful than a kick in the crotch. It may not be the worst, but you might still get serious damage.Our story follows slacker Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch), who robs a convenience store and gets tased by the police. Why? Because Sam Shane (Brooklyn Decker), daughter of Navy Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), wanted a chicken burrito, and he was trying to impress the bimbo. Sadly, it works.His brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgrd) forces him to go into the Navy to get his life together, where Alex continues screwing up. In fact, he screws up so badly after a soccer game against the Japanese navy that Admiral Shane plans to kick him out. But for some reason, they allow him to command a ship in the RIMPAC, presumably so he can continue to embarrass the United States in front of the whole world.But the RIMPAC is interrupted when a group of alien ships arrive on Earth -- and suddenly Hawaii is sealed off by a giant forcefield, with only a few ships on the inside. And after his brother's ship is destroyed, Alex suddenly finds himself in command -- and must find a way to destroy the alien ships before a full-scale invasion can attack Earth.First, some faint praise. ""Battleship"" is not QUITE a bad as a Michael Bay movie, mainly because it doesn't have the blatant sexism and racism. And while Bay practically fetishizes the American military, director Peter Berg seems to have genuine admiration for our soldiers -- consider a moving subplot about a double-amputee soldier who fights the aliens despite his disability. Or the elderly veterans who appear to help destroy the alien ships.However...Everything else is Michael Bay fanfiction. Unfunny comic relief, idiotic dialogue (""He said we ain't alone. He said one day, either we'd find them, or they'd find us""), and prolonged scenes that are nothing but explosion after explosion after explosion. And in case you're wondering, the titular Battleship does not even appear until almost two hours into the movie.It also has the most pathetic aliens in film history. They look pretty cool when they have their helmets on, but underneath they're grunting goat/ape hybrids, and they invaded a planet that they cannot tolerate. Oh, and their spaceships are so fragile that they fragment when they hit a stationary satellite, and they have easily-shattered GLASS for windows.And for some reason, Berg seems to believe that the Japanese and Americans working together is somehow surprising... even though the countries have been allies for decades. But hey, it briefly allows a COMPETENT commander to take over the American warship.When elderly, real-life Navy veterans are able to out-act a cast of actual actors... you're in trouble.  Taylor Kitsch's Alex is possibly the least likable ""hero"" I have ever seen in a movie -- he's a hotheaded, selfish child-man who values his own revenge over the life of his crew. The only reason he ever succeeds at ANYTHING is because other people implement his ideas.Pop singer Rihanna has the acting talents of a log, and Liam Neeson's contemptuous (and brief) performance practically screams, ""I'm just doing this for the money, so please leave me alone."" Actually, there is only one likable character in this whole mess: Tadanobu Asano as a Japanese naval captain who is competent, cool and smart. When he briefly replaces Kitsch as captain, nobody utters a peep of protest.""Battleship"" should have replaced the last letter with a T. Despite the respect it shows America's veterans, it's a Michael-Bay-style eruption of pure ineptitude -- so ignore this mess unless you have a lot of booze and friends who like to riff bad movies.",1,CHICKEN BURRITO?,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,4029,"['seeing', 'Battleship', 'first', 'thing', 'did', 'was', 'check', 'IMDB', 'see', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'had', 'directed', 'produced', 'written', 'lump', 'steaming', 'festering', 'tripe.No', 'apparently', 'Bay', 'fanboys', 'who', 'aspire', 'make', 'same', 'kind', 'movies', 'monstrous', 'overblown', 'explosionfests', 'borderline', 'fetishize', 'American', 'military', 'Peter', 'Berg', ""n't"", 'QUITE', 'as', 'bad', 'Bay', 'saying', 'punch', 'gut', 'less', 'painful', 'kick', 'crotch', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'worst', 'might', 'still', 'get', 'serious', 'damage.Our', 'story', 'slacker', 'Alex', 'Hopper', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'who', 'robs', 'convenience', 'store', 'tased', 'police', 'Why', 'Sam', 'Shane', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'daughter', 'Navy', 'Admiral', 'Shane', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'wanted', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'was', 'trying', 'impress', 'bimbo', 'Sadly', 'brother', 'Stone', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'go', 'Navy', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'where', 'Alex', 'screwing', 'up', 'fact', 'up', 'so', 'badly', 'soccer', 'game', 'Japanese', 'navy', 'Admiral', 'Shane', 'kick', 'out', 'reason', 'allow', 'command', 'ship', 'RIMPAC', 'presumably', 'can', 'continue', 'embarrass', 'United', 'States', 'front', 'whole', 'world.But', 'RIMPAC', 'interrupted', 'when', 'group', 'alien', 'ships', 'arrive', 'Earth', 'suddenly', 'Hawaii', 'sealed', 'off', 'giant', 'forcefield', 'only', 'few', 'ships', 'inside', 'brother', 'ship', 'destroyed', 'Alex', 'suddenly', 'command', 'must', 'find', 'way', 'destroy', 'alien', 'ships', 'full-scale', 'invasion', 'can', 'attack', 'Earth.First', 'faint', 'praise', 'Battleship', 'not', 'QUITE', 'bad', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'movie', 'mainly', ""n't"", 'have', 'blatant', 'sexism', 'racism', 'Bay', 'practically', 'American', 'military', 'director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'have', 'genuine', 'admiration', 'soldiers', 'consider', 'moving', 'subplot', 'double-amputee', 'soldier', 'who', 'aliens', 'disability', 'elderly', 'veterans', 'who', 'appear', 'help', 'destroy', 'alien', 'ships.However', 'Everything', 'else', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'fanfiction', 'Unfunny', 'comic', 'relief', 'idiotic', 'dialogue', 'said', 'ai', ""n't"", 'alone', 'said', 'one', 'day', ""'d"", 'find', ""'d"", 'find', 'prolonged', 'scenes', 'are', 'nothing', 'explosion', 'explosion', 'explosion', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'titular', 'Battleship', 'not', 'even', 'appear', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'movie.It', 'also', 'most', 'pathetic', 'aliens', 'film', 'history', 'look', 'pretty', 'cool', 'when', 'have', 'helmets', ""'re"", 'grunting', 'goat/ape', 'hybrids', 'invaded', 'planet', 'can', 'not', 'tolerate', 'Oh', 'spaceships', 'are', 'so', 'fragile', 'fragment', 'when', 'hit', 'stationary', 'satellite', 'have', 'easily-shattered', 'GLASS', 'windows.And', 'reason', 'Berg', 'believe', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'working', 'together', 'somehow', 'surprising', 'even', 'countries', 'have', 'been', 'allies', 'decades', 'COMPETENT', 'commander', 'take', 'over', 'American', 'warship.When', 'elderly', 'real-life', 'Navy', 'veterans', 'are', 'able', 'out-act', 'cast', 'actual', 'actors', ""'re"", 'trouble', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Alex', 'possibly', 'least', 'likable', 'hero', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'hotheaded', 'selfish', 'child-man', 'who', 'own', 'revenge', 'life', 'crew', 'only', 'reason', 'ever', 'ANYTHING', 'other', 'people', 'implement', 'ideas.Pop', 'singer', 'Rihanna', 'acting', 'talents', 'log', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'contemptuous', 'brief', 'performance', 'practically', ""'m"", 'just', 'doing', 'money', 'so', 'please', 'leave', 'alone', 'Actually', 'only', 'one', 'likable', 'character', 'whole', 'mess', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'Japanese', 'naval', 'captain', 'who', 'competent', 'cool', 'smart', 'When', 'briefly', 'replaces', 'Kitsch', 'captain', 'nobody', 'utters', 'peep', 'protest', 'Battleship', 'should', 'have', 'replaced', 'last', 'letter', 'T.', 'respect', 'America', 'veterans', 'Michael-Bay-style', 'eruption', 'pure', 'ineptitude', 'so', 'ignore', 'mess', 'have', 'lot', 'booze', 'friends', 'who', 'like', 'riff', 'bad', 'movies']",N/A

In the case of this movie, the first half hour is a slow torturous trek involving a silly bar scene, a case of breaking and entering, instant advancement in the Navy (apparently they will take anyone), a soccer game, occasional announcements to remind us that this is indeed a Sci-Fi flick (wait for it..........), plus a little pomp without the circumstances.  There was also an abbreviated romance tossed in for good measure, involving an idiot (Taylor Kitsch) who (as movie clich&eacute;s would have it) likes to talk to himself in the mirror.  I clocked the amount of wasted time at 36 minutes before there was any sign of the pesky aliens.  At that point I was beginning to despair, was this a Lifetime movie about unrequited love?  I paid good money for aliens and battle scenes!I will admit, once the action finally started, it rarely let up and was almost worth the long wait.  The F/X was snazzy, the battles were frenetic, and the aliens fascinating (once unmasked).  But.  There was that extraordinarily long wait.  And for some strange reason, I thought this was Liam Neeson's film.  He was rarely to be seen and given precious little to do.  Instead, the apparent star of this feature was an unusually bland actor (Taylor Kitsch) who must think a perpetual scowl is the best form of emoting in any and all situations.  His lack of personality is astounding.At this point, I'm still debating whether to keep this for future viewings.

1471344,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAIHPE,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[5, 7]","2012 already racked up a few blockbuster box office disasters. Many times the failure to bring in the audiences and money studios expected is warranted. Other times it's a lack of promotion and unexpected disinterest in the project. One of the films I was hard on before I saw it was ""Battleship."" I'm glad I got another chance to see it on Blu-ray now that it's coming out through Universal Studios Home Entertainment.It appeared Hasbro and Universal were just trying to cash in on the success of the ""Transformers"" and G.I. Joe"" movies. Could lightning strike three times and another one of their other popular lines garner as much attention? The dismal domestic box office numbers answered that question with a loud, ""Not in America!"" The negative response to the film gave a whole new meaning to the famous phrase, ""You sank my Battleship!""Naval officer Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is assigned to the USS John Paul Jones after being forced to join the military by his older brother who also serves. When the Earth is attacked by alien forces, a fleet of battleships are sent to engage them. They must also thwart the aliens' plans to send a message to their home planet seeking reinforcements.Writers Jon and Erich Hoeber and director Peter Berg should be commended for at least attempting to give ""Battleship"" a story the audience could identify with. A couple of the characters are developed enough to where we care what happens to them. Unfortunately, most of the supporting cast is just warm bodies propped up for looks or to fire guns or push buttons.The visual effects and CGI in the movie look good. One of the most impressive scenes is when one of the battleships goes down. It's reminiscent of the sinking of the Titanic in James Cameron's hit; just with way more explosions. The aliens aren't the usual lizard-like type we've been seeing lately. They are humanoid and uniquely creepy.I feel sorry for Taylor Kitsch after seeing this movie. The guy can act and did his best in both ""Battleship"" and ""John Carter."" The movies definitely didn't fail at the box office because of his performances. Liam Neeson is completely wasted in the film. He is onscreen a total of 15 minutes. He goes between looking like he cares and appearing indifferent. I'm not sure why Rihanna is in the movie. Why go to all the trouble to get a famous singer in your movie and then waste her character? She has hardly any lines and just blows stuff up while looking tough.The main problem with ""Battleship"" is it gets tedious. The excitement of ships shooting at each other in the water only lasts so long. A feeling of repetition hit me about an hour into the film.One thing I'll give the writers is credit for coming up with ingenious ways to use the different concepts from the game. The red pegs were utilized in the film as alien missiles. The crew also had to guess where the ships were in the water through eliminating areas on a visual computer graph.The high definition transfer of the movie is excellent. The picture is clear and the colors are vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound throws explosions and sound effects at you from all directions. They're excellently mixed with the dialogue and musical score. There are plenty of special features to get consumers excited.They include featurettes like ""Preparing for Battle,"" ""All Hands on Deck: The Cast,"" ""Engage in Battle: Shooting at Sea"" ""All aboard the Fleet,"" ""The Visual Effects of 'Battleship',"" ""USS Missouri VIP Tour,"" and ""Commander Pete."" An alternate ending previsualization is also included.

1471362,AZAEJB1ECT9HC,B005LAIHPE,Gary P. Cohen,"[0, 0]","Battleship is basically &#34;Independence Day&#34; vs. the U.S.  Navy.  A bunch of nerdy and cowardly scientists decide to broadcast a welcome towards a newly discovered planet with an atmosphere like Earth's.  This proves to be a rather poor idea when the aliens accept their welcome and decide to pay us a visit and conquer our planet.The aliens create a forcefield that traps 3 US Navy and one Japanese destroyer.  When the aliens destroy 3 out of the 4 ships, it is the crew of the final destroyer, John  Paul Jones, led by a young Lieutenant, (just about to be kicked out of the Navy for being an absolute jerk,) that figures out how to destroy them.  Since this takes place in Hawaii, the eventual plan involved taking the famous World War II Battleship the USS Missouri out to sea again, the crew consisting of sailors from the John Paul Jones and elderly naval veterans who served on the Missouri in WW II.  (For some reason, they are aboard the ship and are immediately ready for action.) Obviously, none of this makes any sense.  Also not making any sense is the hero of this film who, at the beginning, is an absolute jerk and loser.  He is forced by his naval officer brother to join the Navy and the next thing we know, he is now a young Naval Lieutenant.  (Does it really take such a short period of time to become an officer in the US Navy?)The reason to see this film are the action scenes and special effects, both of which are great.  Don't think about the plot, just have a good time as I did when I saw it in the movies.  (I must have been one of the few since the film was a giant flop.)The blu-ray includes several special features, many focusing on the film's enthusiastic director, Peter Berg.  The best special feature is a tour of the actual USS Missouri, currently dry-docked in Hawaii.  This is excellent and well-worth watching.  There are no deleted scenes although it does have  an &#34;alternate ending previsualization&#34; that wasn't done according to Berg because it was deemed too expensive.

I thought it was pretty entertaining, and I was able to overlook some of the more questionable aspects of the plot (such as two dozen old timers being able to get an out of service battleship running in about an hour), because, after all... you really shouldn't take this movie too seriously. Think about it- it's based on a classic board game, and it's a tale about alien invaders doing battle with naval ships stationed in Hawaii. It was very clearly influenced by the Transformers formula, the big name in the Hasbro stable. I think kids and teenagers in particular will love this movie, but I'm 33, and I still had a good time watching it.The design and CGI execution of the alien war ships is positively awesome, the best I can remember ever having seen. Though the actual alien creature design is not particularly interesting or original, their machines are the real stars of the show. Major kudos to the CGI team that put this movie together, because the special effects are just incredible. Furthermore, these ships become engaged in a strategic battle with the US Destroyers that tastefully (and cleverly) pays homage to the board game after which this movie is (VERY LOOSELY) based.This movie is fun, and the special effects are super cool. Blu-ray transfer is spectacular, and it really pops off of the screen. The characters are charismatic, the plot moves fast, and the tension is convincingly conveyed throughout.

1471374,A2T0V99GLGXWCM,B005LAIHPE,Ghost(Ghost(M)),"[0, 0]","Let's cut to the chase: there is only one thing I liked about this flick: alien battleships. They were awesome! I wish they just spent the whole movie parading them around. They're done in the style of Transformers in a snazzy steely-blue/flaming-orange/red colour scheme. They are HUGE; they fly; they careen; they whoosh heavily into the ocean; they take off and plop back like Exocoetidae, heavily; they shapeshift, and, with heavy clangour and rumble, unfurl multiple batteries of a sort of flaming mitrailleuse-minewerfern, launching lethal barrages of sort of beercans that fly in high-arched trajectory over the battlefield and burrow into the target before blowing up to the ucking skies; wow, these alien ships were awesome -- I couldn't get enough of these wonderful alien ships. If I could run into one in real life, that'd be too exciting for words.Now, the rest: overlong; dragging (first 30 mins nothing happens, annoying); cliched throughout; unbearable expansive, sprawling Hollywood score that never shuts up; plot unoriginal in the extreme. Aliens themselves are far less impressive than their ships: they basically are misshapen fugly big humans with four fingers and two opposing thumbs, with snake eyes; that's all. They're very strong, but not so superiour that you couldn't deal with them; and their weapons are kind of like cannons, so where's the big deal, they're aliens after all, where's super nuclear ray weapons that are making enemy annihilate w/o him noticing it. Why do they throw high explosives just like our boys? Their ships, once again, are awesome and sexy, but the rest of their accoutrements are underwhelming. They walk around in metallic Swiss-army-knife scaphandres sort of thing: come on, Ahnie looked better in Terminator twenty years ago. He also talked funny -- these dudes don't. Or take Predators, they were also better. There's a number of participants whose parts are nominal, like Liam Neeson. What's he doing here? He has a five-minute, ten words role. Probably wanted to expedite payments on his new car or something... he was there but he wasn't there. ""Pretty girl"" personage, same thing, no role, and to be honest, while she was tall and blond, she wasn't all that pretty. Come on. Diversity: oh yeah, diversified up to wazoo in the new Hollywood fashion. Heroic African-American: check; comic (in intent, not reality) dweeby scientist who's cowardly but when needed finds courage: check, etc. What else? Nothing really... you've seen it all a billion times before. The whole affair is fundamentally boring. You only feel good when there's alien ships on screen, otherwise it's like, where's my remote, let's FF a few minutes while they're doing nothing worthwhile till maybe there's more alien ships heaving in from under the water.Long story short: it's a twaddly and overlong Fourth of July cum Transformers. It's not what you'd call ""BAD"". It's just very, very mediocre (except for the alien ships! these are awesome, and you'll want them to bear your children). I would recommend that if you decide to watch it, watch it like you watch pr0n: ff to the alien ships, let them do whatever (whoosh, splash, rumble, etc); once it's over, FF to the next alien-ship scene. You'll be done in... um... about 20-30 mins and then you can turn the movie off.",2,Worthless twaddle.

1471377,A234L7R41ZLI3H,B005LAIHPE,"ginmar ""book/digital addict""","[1, 3]","There are some movies that just want to entertain you. This is one of them. It has no geopolitical pretenses, no higher motives, no highfalutin' ambitions. It's fun, it's got great CGI, and yet there's moments that are genuinely striking, particularly in the relationship between the layabout leading man and the Japanese captain who helps him after the fecal matter hits the circulating air device. As a matter of fact, I found that relationship kind of touching, given the respectful way the Japanese were treated throughout the film, as allies.  I also liked that the crew reflected something of Hawaii's racial mix in its population, and that the sarcastic cameraderie of the military was captured in much of its scatalogical glory. And most wonderful of all was the performance of an actual Army vet in a major, unforgettable role as the amputee who needed something to fight for after a lifetime of service.I have to say the weakest link was a froth-spitting Alexander Skaarsgaard,  whose entire performance in this movie seemed to consist of humorless pill or goggle eyed cannon fodder, but that's the way I've found him in so many other things. I'm biased in favor of his father, and with good reason.The movie starts out with an absolutely hysterical exercise in comic excess, as Hopper, the lead character, tries to impress a pretty girl in a bar. You'll never look at another chicken burrito again, and Taylor Kitsch shamelessly milks the comedy from every last second of it. What's surprising is that she's the daughter of an Admiral, and she's very much the love interest, but not in the family business. It's the one kind of disappointing decision in the movie, especially seeing as how the actress gamely makes as much of the role as she can, given that there's not much there. (Having Rihanna around, nailing her lines with attitude and relish doesn't help her, either.) Speaking of Rihanna, she's both bad ass and funny consistently the way through, whether saying, ""Maholo, (word that refers via obscenity to Oedipus' improper relationship with his mother)"", or spanking a Japanese rival in soccer on the bootie and saying, ""C'mon, princess.""The heroism of the lead character isn't black and white or anything, either: it's flawed and stubborn and based on bad decisions, but he listens to wiser voices, whatever their rank, and manages to save lives and eventually redeem himself, in some rather touching scenes. (Even if, as I am, an Army vet and not a Navy one.) The chemistry between the characters enlivens almost all of the dialogue and interaction, and while most of the actors were relative unknowns,(at least to me and with the exception of Neeson and Rihanna) they commanded the screen and gave the movie a richness of personality you just wouldn't expect. The name actors----Skarsgaard and Neeson-----were outplayed by the many small roles filled with actors who made the very most of their short time on the screens. It was a delightful surprise.There's some surprising emotional heft to the movie due to the absolute rightness of some of the way the director ""got"" the way soldiers, sailors, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard will nag and fight among themselves and then practically kill themselves to save a fellow the very next minute if one of their brethren come under fire.Now on to the bad: the plot, and....the plot.

And unless you're a military-hating type who only loves movies that show soldiers as suicidal, wife-beating druggies, this should be fun for you, too.""Terrible script"", they said. Well, this isn't Henry V. It's a movie based on a Hasbro game, fer Pete's sake, so lose those snobbish pretensions at the door. The dialogue us mostly appropriate for the characters and the situation. It's not Plato. It's action and heartstrings. And this it does well. It's touching, stirring, and exciting. There are character arcs, albeit predictable.Does everything make sense? Mostly. There are things which are strange, such as the aliens' risk assessment algorithm. You'll just have to buy that, although it can be rationalized. Can a hothead like the hero become a captain, then be kicked out? Hmmm. Hard to believe.But it does feel good to see Americans and Japanese working together to save the world. You get to see the classic game translated to the movies, in a pretty clever way. There's lots of action, and well-shot, not like the crappy shaky-camera work in the Bourne movies. You'll like the characters. And you will tear up when the Missouri goes back into action with a geriatric crew.Go and see it wanting to have a good time at the movies instead of the artsy claptrap the critics love, and you'll be OK.I'd give it 3.5 stars.

The poorly researched stupid idea that the alien craft were not composed of any elements known in the periodic table (therefore anywhere in the Universe) except the does-not-make-sense, manmade, and always radioactive - very short life, Lawrencium. Alien craft construction that defies everything known about physics; both the time to receive the initial transmission and physically travel (they were just waiting for that random signal) should have taken decades if not hundreds or more years - not a few months that the movie indicated for the whole shebang. The aliens must have had their space craft idling at the curb for millions of years waiting for that one transmitted signal so they could jump right on it.(2.) Usual dorky, nerdy weird scientists. Usual '80s style Pac-man graphics to show some really stupid triangles representing aliens traveling through a grade school background of our solar system. A '50s scify bubble force field -  whoopee, not likely! The aliens Mi34 rotating mingun style battery grenade launchers seemed more appropriate to WWI - just dumb!(3.) Usual dialogue for 9th grade drop-out fans of this stuff like Goldilocks paranoia (mistake to invite just anybody into your house), aliens stolen from ""Predator"" and other old scify pushing the cowboys vs. indians stereotype.(4.)

1471396,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B005LAIHPE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 5]","""You sank my BATTLESHIP!!"" is what each suit at Universal Studios is yelling at the cast and crew. While the film had better success overseas and even though it's on the verge of tallying a global sum of over 300 million, I guess it's all about how it performs domestically. In part you have to factor in that THE AVENGERS ate up much of the box office gross. In part you have to look at the flaws within BATTLESHIP because, to drop some sea slang, not all the hatches were battened down.BATTLESHIP is this generation's INDEPENDENCE DAY, except that Taylor Kitsch doesn't come near to matching Will Smith's palpable cool and charisma. Taylor Kitsch, more accurately, strives to Tom Cruise his way thru the movie, except that he also doesn't generate Cruise's swagger. On the other hand, Kitsch does make for a perfectly serviceable lead hero.***PLOT SPOILERS from now on***He plays 26-year-old slacker Alex Hopper, and Alex is an epic screw-up. His latest scrape - breaking into a convenience store to present a fine chick (Brooklyn Decker) with a chicken burrito she'd been craving - results in his arrest and his fed-up naval officer bro (Alexander Skarsgard) issuing an ultimatum: enlist in the U.S. Navy or dot dot dot...But before all that, BATTLESHIP actually opens up with yet one more exploration into hubris, as we're made privy to the Beacon Project, a deep space endeavor which hinges on our scientists' transmitting a constant signal to a newly discovered and possibly habitable planet somewhere in the far reaches of the universe.In the Navy, some years later, Alex Hopper has found a home, has found a girl (in fact, the same girl, hot burrito babe). He's ascended to the rank of Lieutenant and is the Tactical Action Officer on the destroyer, the John Paul Jones. Only, the screw-up is never too far from the surface, and Hopper finds the most inopportune time to bollocks it all up. He is madly in love with the burrito girl - okay, her name is Samantha - and he intends to ask her father's permission to marry her, never mind that Sam is the daughter of the very intimidating fleet admiral (Liam Neeson). Except that Hopper falls back to bad habits. It starts when Hopper and Sam wake up late for a naval ceremony on board the 70-year-old museum relic, the U.S.S. Missouri. From there, for Hopper, it downspirals.The U.S. fleet is currently undergoing naval exercises several miles off Oahu, a joint venture which includes the Japanese Navy, and I think this very convenient happenstance pops up just so Hopper can spark a heated rivalry against a brash Japanese officer (Tadanobu Asano) and bring about Hopper's career-ending snafu. Hopper's most recent conduct unbecoming is the final straw; he's informed that when his ship pulls into port, he'll be drummed out of the service.So, thank goodness for the alien attack.If you're that one person who'd been clamoring for a film adaptation of Hasbro's great game of strategy, my friend, this is your moment. You, more than most, will likely appreciate the film's nods to the classic board game, from giant exploding pegs to the mimicry of the board game itself, thanks to a sneaky strategy that calls for a plot chart superimposed on a grid of weather buoys. I was surprised at how much I got into it during that combat sequence.3.5 out of 5 stars for BATTLESHIP, and I didn't think I'd be that generous. You know what you're walking into: a summer blockbuster that is mindless but fun, garish but visually flawless. It's commercially calculated. The dialogue is by the numbers. There's perfunctory attention given to character development. I mean, check out Hopper's sweeping trajectory: our lead guy goes from a B & E at a convenience store to suddenly commanding his own vessel.Hopper doesn't have time to contemplate his recent knucklehead blunders. Four alien spacecrafts have just plummeted into the Pacific waters. An impenetrable bubble barrier 300,000 feet in altitude and 2 nautical miles deep has just surrounded and isolated three destroyers from the naval exercises. I think that was Tokyo that was crapp'd on just now. Hopper, Petty Officer Cora 'Weps' Raikes (Rihanna), and some expendable red shirt approach one alien ship. And is it just me or were the alien ships pretty passive until the humans started messing about? Anyway, Hopper's little scouting party causes the alien craft to launch hellacious ordinance on the destroyers. And before you can say ""bonehead boo-boo,"" massive casualties and the time-honored chain of command have left Hopper as senior officer onboard the John Paul Jones. This doesn't instill much confidence in what's left of his crew.The acting won't bowl you over. Liam Neeson sleepwalks thru his role. But I thought Rihanna's stunt casting actually worked out okay. And real-life war veteran and double amputee Gregory D. Gadson, as the recovering, tough-as-nails Lt. Colonel Mick Canales, exudes a solid presence. That doesn't imply that I savored his scenes with Brooklyn Decker and Hamish Linklater (who takes on the requisite nerd scientist Jeff Goldblum role). It feels to me like the film wanted to retain the eye candy factor and was looking for a plot thread to feature Decker. She, Gadson, and Linklater get tapped with having to take out the Oahu-based satellite substation before the alien ships can signal for reinforcements.I liked BATTLESHIP, despite its plot holes wide enough for a naval fleet to steer thru. It met my expectations (which weren't very high), and even exceeded them in certain areas (for one thing, it's funnier than I thought it would be). In my opinion, director Peter Berg makes his film more charming and likable than Michael Bay's 'bots in disguise franchise. Half an hour into it, I found myself onboard with the ridiculous shenanigans. I thought the aliens came off meaner than the Chitauri (this is a good thing). And, it turns out, one cheesy moment doubles as a neat moment when, late in the game, Hopper gets unexpected support in the shape of a crew of old timers. Cue the Mighty Mo, and cue the ACDC track. I think Peter Berg should take on Scrabble next. Or Boggle. Or Hungry Hungry Hippos.If you care about that sort of stuff, stick around for the post-credits scene.",4,"""I got a bad feeling about this... like a 'We're gonna need a new planet'

1471406,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B005LAIHPE,Ian,"[3, 7]","Yes, they made a full length movie based off a children's board game that had no plot whatsoever.  Yes, it sounds crazy, and leads to endless jokes about how desperate for ideas Hollywood must be if they resort to board games for film ideas (can a ""Hungry Hungry Hippos"" movie be heading our way in the near future?).  Yet, despite all the odds, we have a genuine Battleship movie that is decisively not bad, but actually pretty good.The movie follows Alex Hopper, a brilliant but lazy guy who spends his days drinking, and slacking out on his brother's couch.  After a fiasco involving a gal and a chicken burrito, Alex finds himself in the navy, and facing the fight of his life, as several alien ships land during a war games exercise.  Thus, both sides engage in a deadly game of deceit and combat, with the fate of the world at stake.Considering how plot less the original board game was, the filmmakers deserve a lot of credit for creating a story that doesn't get bogged down with exposition or in-depth attempts to explain things, instead going for the Michael Bay approach:  Lots and lots and lots of explosions, firearms getting shot off, big visual effects, aliens, and more explosions.  And amazingly, it works.  The movie knows it's entire existence is silly in the first place, and runs with it (at one point, the aliens and humans literally play battleship with each other, in the manner of the game itself).  The story, while simple, does move along briskly, and never lags, ensuring that the viewer is never bored, and while the characters are a bit stereotyped, they're entertaining enough to watch, and Alex, though burdened with the traditional, ""smart but lazy guy who has to grow and reach his true potential"" plot, serves well as the film's protagonist.  Equal recognition must be given to Mick, a double-amputee soldier who helps contribute to the fight against the aliens, and is a delight to watch, as we rarely see amputees getting their own action sequences.Surprisingly, there are some unexpected moments of greatness here:  The aliens themselves, while clearly not friendly, don't go around killing everyone in sight, which gives them a fascinating moral side.  I also loved how the battleship of the movie's title comes into play, and it's role in the fight against the aliens, and is easily the most entertaining part of the film.Still, for action and nice touches, ""Battleship"" is essentially the standard blockbuster entertainment: it deals in broad strokes with story and characters, and relies heavily on action scenes to keep the audience's interest.  I do wish there were scenes where the entire naval fleet engaged in combat, rather then just a few ships, and Liam Neeson is criminally underused, but as a whole, ""Battleship"" is an entertaining surprise that works perfectly as harmless, B-grade movie fun.

1471411,A3IXZJ1L73DYTA,B005LAIHPE,Jack E. Levic,"[1, 1]","I was in no rush to see BATTLESHIP knowing it was based on the Hasbro game and it had not been well-received by the critics or public. I did not know the story and imagined battleships fighting each other on the high sea. BATTLESHIP became a must see when I saw that lovely, sexy singer Rihanna was one of the stars. Rihanna? In an action film? Really? It was worth a look.BATTLESHIP is off to a slow start. A troubled loser with no future joins the Navy as a last resort. Despite his bad attitude, he shows potential and moves up in rank. Is any of this a surprise? How about the fact that he is in love with the admiral's daughter. Any surprise there? Our hero butts heads with all of his superiors and is about to be thrown out of the navy when it happens...Scientists have discovered a planet that seems to be in the right position from its own sun to be a twin of earth. Maybe life exists so signals are sent from earth to this distant planet to make contact. Here was the huge twist from what I expected. What happens if the aliens receive the signal and decide to come visit their ""brothers"" on earth?Suddenly, BATTLESHIP has some potential as the alien spaceships are seen. Here come in the amazing visual effects and possibly an interesting story. Are the aliens here as friends or conquerors? What are their intentions. At first it seems they are interested in destroying machinery and not out to destroy humans. There is a bit of confusion here. The US Navy fires first and maybe our alien friends are just in self-defense mode. The visual effects are amazing and we get to see human-like aliens. How would life develop on a ""sister"" planet light years away. It is an interesting premise.Unfortunately, amazing visual effects can't always save a film riddled with clich&eacute;s. BATTLESHIP is a combination of so many films we have seen before. It's part JURASSIC PARK and INDEPENDENCE DAY. Add in Pearl Harbor since the on land part of the story takes place on Oahu with a connection to Pearl Harbor and the Japanese are involved again (as the good guys) attacking Oahu.Apparently, the director thought Rihanna would be good in the role of a sailor and she was eager to do a movie role. It's hard to imagine Rihanna as a sailor helping to save the world but the woman is talented. I guess she could help save the world.BATTLESHIP misses so much of its potential. Why not have the aliens come with a clear message. What do they want? We learn they have one problem with life on earth. There always has to be one simple problem that aliens can't cope with on earth.The movie drags on. The beautiful daughter of the admiral obviously will have some role in helping to save the world while her navy man is at sea. Lian Neeson is the admiral and suprisingly this is a relatively small role for Neeson. Maybe he needed the work.BATTLESHIP is worth seeing because of the phenomenal special effects but if a good story is important you, this is a film that can be missed.",3,PROMISING IDEA LOST IN A SEA OF CLICH&Eacute;S,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2976,"['was', 'rush', 'see', 'BATTLESHIP', 'knowing', 'was', 'based', 'Hasbro', 'game', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'well-received', 'critics', 'public', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'story', 'imagined', 'battleships', 'fighting', 'other', 'high', 'sea', 'BATTLESHIP', 'became', 'must', 'see', 'when', 'saw', 'lovely', 'sexy', 'singer', 'Rihanna', 'was', 'one', 'stars', 'Rihanna', 'action', 'film', 'Really', 'was', 'worth', 'look.BATTLESHIP', 'slow', 'start', 'troubled', 'loser', 'future', 'Navy', 'last', 'resort', 'bad', 'attitude', 'potential', 'up', 'rank', 'surprise', 'How', 'fact', 'love', 'admiral', 'daughter', 'surprise', 'there', 'hero', 'butts', 'heads', 'superiors', 'be', 'thrown', 'navy', 'when', 'Scientists', 'have', 'discovered', 'planet', 'be', 'right', 'position', 'own', 'sun', 'be', 'twin', 'earth', 'Maybe', 'life', 'exists', 'signals', 'are', 'sent', 'earth', 'distant', 'planet', 'make', 'contact', 'Here', 'was', 'huge', 'twist', 'what', 'expected', 'What', 'aliens', 'receive', 'signal', 'decide', 'come', 'visit', 'brothers', 'earth', 'Suddenly', 'BATTLESHIP', 'potential', 'alien', 'spaceships', 'are', 'seen', 'Here', 'come', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'possibly', 'interesting', 'story', 'Are', 'aliens', 'here', 'friends', 'conquerors', 'What', 'are', 'intentions', 'first', 'are', 'interested', 'destroying', 'machinery', 'not', 'destroy', 'humans', 'bit', 'confusion', 'here', 'US', 'Navy', 'fires', 'first', 'maybe', 'alien', 'friends', 'are', 'just', 'self-defense', 'mode', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'amazing', 'get', 'see', 'human-like', 'aliens', 'How', 'would', 'life', 'develop', 'sister', 'planet', 'light', 'years', 'away', 'interesting', 'premise.Unfortunately', 'amazing', 'visual', 'effects', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'save', 'film', 'riddled', 'clich', 'eacute', 'BATTLESHIP', 'combination', 'so', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'part', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'INDEPENDENCE', 'DAY', 'Add', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'land', 'part', 'story', 'place', 'Oahu', 'connection', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'Japanese', 'are', 'involved', 'again', 'good', 'guys', 'attacking', 'Oahu.Apparently', 'director', 'thought', 'Rihanna', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'role', 'sailor', 'was', 'eager', 'do', 'movie', 'role', 'hard', 'imagine', 'Rihanna', 'sailor', 'helping', 'save', 'world', 'woman', 'talented', 'guess', 'could', 'help', 'save', 'world.BATTLESHIP', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'aliens', 'come', 'clear', 'message', 'What', 'do', 'want', 'learn', 'have', 'one', 'problem', 'life', 'earth', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'simple', 'problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'cope', 'earth.The', 'movie', 'drags', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'admiral', 'obviously', 'will', 'have', 'role', 'helping', 'save', 'world', 'navy', 'man', 'sea', 'Lian', 'Neeson', 'admiral', 'suprisingly', 'relatively', 'small', 'role', 'Neeson', 'Maybe', 'needed', 'work.BATTLESHIP', 'worth', 'seeing', 'phenomenal', 'special', 'effects', 'good', 'story', 'important', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

You see, you got a total slacker who doesn't know how to grow up, living with his Marine brother, and now has to join the Marine, yet it seems like he's been in it for some time as it is (and with no indication of any length of time passing by for him to get promoted, and it's impossible for it to have happened so quickly), and during the Marine's own battle game on the sea, some transmission sent out to a distant planet back in '06 has a few spaceships coming to Earth. They use their superior technology to create a lifelike board game, destroying everything that threatens violence at it (and then some on land).There really seemed to be nothing for me in this film worth enjoying beyond the special effects (as I said before), its script, for the most part, was cookie-cutter and unrealistic. Some of the characters seem to come up with some random bit of helpful info just out of nowhere without prelude. Not to mention the aliens their selves, look entirely laughable (like parts of the script, too laughable for me to enjoy thoroughly), and I guess they had budget cuts on their own currency if their own technology can't come up with better sound effects when they detect some threat.Then are certain soldiers that don't act like the real deal- like they don't have a mind to think with in the most common sensical ways. And a death scene presented just did not have the emotional substance for me to shed a tear, it simply felt like they tried too hard to yank the tears out, and failed.Really, Hasbro, did you learn nothing from Michal Bay's abysmal interpretation of Transformers? The special effects may be cool, but they don't replace substantial story and characterization (especially when a character breaks in to a convenience store, keeps looking into the camera, and does not seem to care he keeps breaking law after law), and not all scientists talk like the cardboard thin scientist who apparently represents those who think people with artificial replacements are ""cyborgs"" (that did bother me, and I have no replacements, I thought it unscientific and not humorous).

S. of A. has been sinking ever further into bankster/crony neo-mercantilism, other economic and political corruption, oppressive surveillance, and national insolvency. However, I had spent childhood, youth, and early adulthood in the U.S., including military service (during the Kennedy years) in the U.S. Navy, and it always is impressive in some detached, objective way (however perversely) to see a naval war machine act so efficiently and effectively as it does in this film, even that only amounts to mere fiction convincingly enacted on the screen.Just as I was beginning to think of this motion picture as merely another pleasant Navy movie, and one that can be just a bit annoyingly hokey in spots, ON CAME THE U.S.S. MISSOURI, that actual ship herself, which had been trotted out to make this film on her, along with those old veteran sailors who come out to help the youngster Navy men to handle the superb old ship as marshalled together to do battle with aliens to save Planet Earth. Suddenly my emotional sense of involvement with this film surged mightily and I admit that I really got choked up about the setting and the doings. Some of the old sailors of W.W. II and more of them from the Korean War, still would have been on active duty when I was a Navy lad myself so many years ago. I had some of the same feeling that I experienced on seeing ""Under Siege"", of which I also have the DVD, and that also partly had been filmed on the U.S.S. Missouri. My naval service was on a destroyer built during World War II, so it was a wonderful feeling to see the older warship after seeing so many modern smaller ships of like displacement tonnage to the one on which I served. Destroyers now, in the early 21st century, look very different than they did back in the early 1960s, especially than the ships which continued in use after W.W. II was over, such as the Gearing Class destroyer escorts (some acting as destroyers, as ""my"" ship did thus intermittently), the type with which I was so familiar.The U.S. Missouri continued in service for many years longer than most W.W. II vintage ships and therefore continued to undergo overhauls and refitting at the naval yards to keep it up to date with modern technology. For all of that, however, the Missouri still has the basic look of a ship of the earlier era, so the shock of recognition, although not complete, was pleasant to experience on seeing U.S.S. Missouri in this film. In the Navy, it always was awesome to go from a destroyer to a larger ship in the course of work, e.g., to a cruiser (beautiful ships equal in their own ways to the grandeur of a battleship, though not so large as one of them) or to a repair ship, supply ship, or oiler, since the sheer scale on which such large ships were designed and constructed dwarfs something like a destroyer.Fans of naval ships get both worlds in this movie, the ultra-modern destroyers of today and the vintage wonder that is (and remains) the U.S.S. Missouri. What a delight! It's worth it, believe me, to see the film if only for that! ""Battleship"" is full of action and the special effects are exciting. Those who like sci-fi and/or action films will find much to savour in this movie. I wish that the script's dialogue had been better at points than it is, to avoid some corniness and gauche chauvinism (referring to the nationalist, not to the gender-related kind, since women have an important part in the movie). Just avoid being nit-picky about that kind of thing, pull out the snacks, and enjoy one really entertaining motion picture, as this one surely is, reasonably well acted, and more authentic than a lot of Navy and other seafaring films that I have seen over the years! Even viewers not so ""invested"" in Naval lore, as guys like myself unsurprisingly are, should find much to savour in this thrilling cinematic work.",4,"A Lot of Fun to Watch, and a Lot More Than Only That for Anyone Who's Done Naval Service!",1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,4289,"['love', 'movies', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'are', 'Navy', 'true', 'ships', 'fleets', 'question', 'are', 'Canadian', 'U.S.', 'British', 'Australian', 'German', 'Japanese', 'whatever', 'two', 'World', 'Wars', 'afterwards', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'life', 'Dominion', 'Canada', 'where', 'was', 'naturalised', 'citizen', 'identify', 'more', 'readily', 'Quebecker', 'Canadian', 'American', 'especially', 'U.', 'S.', 'A.', 'been', 'sinking', 'ever', 'further', 'bankster/crony', 'neo-mercantilism', 'other', 'economic', 'political', 'corruption', 'oppressive', 'surveillance', 'national', 'insolvency', 'However', 'had', 'spent', 'childhood', 'youth', 'early', 'adulthood', 'U.S.', 'including', 'military', 'service', 'Kennedy', 'years', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'always', 'impressive', 'detached', 'objective', 'way', 'however', 'perversely', 'see', 'naval', 'war', 'machine', 'act', 'so', 'efficiently', 'effectively', 'film', 'even', 'only', 'mere', 'fiction', 'convincingly', 'enacted', 'screen.Just', 'was', 'beginning', 'think', 'motion', 'picture', 'merely', 'pleasant', 'Navy', 'movie', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'annoyingly', 'hokey', 'spots', 'ON', 'CAME', 'THE', 'U.S.S', 'MISSOURI', 'actual', 'ship', 'had', 'been', 'trotted', 'out', 'make', 'film', 'old', 'veteran', 'sailors', 'who', 'come', 'out', 'help', 'youngster', 'Navy', 'men', 'handle', 'superb', 'old', 'ship', 'marshalled', 'together', 'do', 'battle', 'aliens', 'save', 'Planet', 'Earth', 'Suddenly', 'emotional', 'sense', 'involvement', 'film', 'surged', 'mightily', 'admit', 'really', 'got', 'choked', 'up', 'setting', 'doings', 'old', 'sailors', 'W.W.', 'II', 'more', 'Korean', 'War', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'active', 'duty', 'when', 'was', 'Navy', 'lad', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'same', 'feeling', 'experienced', 'seeing', 'Siege', 'also', 'have', 'DVD', 'also', 'partly', 'had', 'been', 'filmed', 'U.S.S', 'Missouri', 'My', 'naval', 'service', 'was', 'destroyer', 'built', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'wonderful', 'feeling', 'see', 'older', 'warship', 'seeing', 'so', 'many', 'modern', 'smaller', 'ships', 'displacement', 'tonnage', 'one', 'served', 'Destroyers', 'now', 'early', '21st', 'century', 'look', 'very', 'different', 'did', 'back', 'early', '1960s', 'especially', 'ships', 'continued', 'use', 'W.W.', 'II', 'was', 'over', 'such', 'Gearing', 'Class', 'destroyer', 'escorts', 'acting', 'destroyers', 'ship', 'did', 'thus', 'intermittently', 'type', 'was', 'so', 'familiar.The', 'U.S.', 'Missouri', 'continued', 'service', 'many', 'years', 'longer', 'most', 'W.W.', 'II', 'vintage', 'ships', 'therefore', 'continued', 'undergo', 'overhauls', 'refitting', 'naval', 'yards', 'keep', 'up', 'date', 'modern', 'technology', 'however', 'Missouri', 'still', 'basic', 'look', 'ship', 'earlier', 'era', 'shock', 'recognition', 'not', 'complete', 'was', 'pleasant', 'experience', 'seeing', 'U.S.S', 'Missouri', 'film', 'Navy', 'always', 'was', 'awesome', 'go', 'destroyer', 'larger', 'ship', 'course', 'work', 'e.g.', 'cruiser', 'beautiful', 'ships', 'equal', 'own', 'ways', 'grandeur', 'battleship', 'not', 'so', 'large', 'one', 'repair', 'ship', 'supply', 'ship', 'oiler', 'sheer', 'scale', 'such', 'large', 'ships', 'were', 'designed', 'constructed', 'dwarfs', 'something', 'destroyer.Fans', 'naval', 'ships', 'get', 'worlds', 'movie', 'ultra-modern', 'destroyers', 'today', 'vintage', 'wonder', 'U.S.S', 'Missouri', 'What', 'delight', 'believe', 'see', 'film', 'only', 'Battleship', 'full', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'exciting', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'and/or', 'action', 'films', 'will', 'find', 'much', 'savour', 'movie', 'wish', 'script', 'dialogue', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'points', 'avoid', 'corniness', 'gauche', 'chauvinism', 'referring', 'nationalist', 'not', 'gender-related', 'kind', 'women', 'have', 'important', 'part', 'movie', 'Just', 'being', 'nit-picky', 'kind', 'thing', 'pull', 'out', 'snacks', 'enjoy', 'one', 'really', 'entertaining', 'motion', 'picture', 'one', 'surely', 'reasonably', 'well', 'acted', 'more', 'authentic', 'lot', 'Navy', 'other', 'seafaring', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'Even', 'viewers', 'not', 'invested', 'Naval', 'lore', 'guys', 'unsurprisingly', 'are', 'should', 'find', 'much', 'savour', 'thrilling', 'cinematic', 'work']",N/A

Connor ""dragonsandsuch""","[1, 1]","Warning - Spoilers will followThe movie starts off with a decent enough premise - a bunch of common sense lacking eggheads sending out a message to a planet with the potential for intelligent life, without stopping to consider the consequences.We then switch to a completely useless scene where we meet our hero, a loser attempting to steal a chicken burrito from a convenience store. Said loser is then forced to enlist in the Navy by his older brother (who would have made for a better lead) and, miraculously, is an officer in the chain of command next we see him. (To be an officer, he would have had to go through the Naval Academy, or, having enlisted, gone through Officer Training School.) He then goes through the rest of the movie trying to channel is inner Kirk.The aliens are little better. They manage to fly light years to Earth, and then have their communications ship get destroyed when hitting a satellite on their final approach. So their goal is to re-establish communications with their home world, but we do not learn this right away. First, we are left guessing at what motivates the invaders. After all, they only fire upon ships that first fired upon them. (But then they we learn that they somehow cannot ""see"" the ships that are not actually firing upon them - which of course is all lead up to the scene in which they are actually ""playing"" Battleship with the aliens by anticipating blind shots and calling out ""hit"" or ""miss"".) We find out that the conflict is not a simple misunderstanding when the main character has some sort of mind meld with an alien they just happen to find floating in the sea. He sees a vision of them conducting an all out invasion, when he looks into the aliens lizard like eyes (which is how we learn they don't like bright light, but still gives no insight as to why they cannot ""see"" anything not presenting an immediate threat).Back to their goal of getting communications established with their home world. Why is this such a concern for either side? Obviously, the aliens already know where the Earth is.  Are they not able to send more ships without the advance scouts (if that's what they are) reporting back first? And why do the main characters think that the threat is ended if the aliens cannot transfer their message? It's not like this was a random encounter. They followed the instructions given them in the beginning of the movie. Given such a situation, you cannot assume that following waves are not forthcoming.In the end, though it has some interesting action sequences, this movie requires a much greater suspension of disbelief than virtually all big budget alien invasion movies that have come before it. Any alien invasion movie that doesn't have the enemy simply bombard the planet from space requires suspension of disbelief, but this one simply has too many elements that are just not well thought out.",2,Incompetence all around,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,2885,"['Warning', 'Spoilers', 'will', 'followThe', 'movie', 'decent', 'enough', 'premise', 'bunch', 'common', 'sense', 'lacking', 'eggheads', 'sending', 'out', 'message', 'planet', 'potential', 'intelligent', 'life', 'stopping', 'consider', 'consequences.We', 'then', 'switch', 'completely', 'useless', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'hero', 'loser', 'attempting', 'steal', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'convenience', 'store', 'Said', 'loser', 'then', 'forced', 'enlist', 'Navy', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'lead', 'miraculously', 'officer', 'chain', 'command', 'see', 'be', 'officer', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'go', 'Naval', 'Academy', 'having', 'enlisted', 'gone', 'Officer', 'Training', 'School', 'then', 'rest', 'movie', 'trying', 'channel', 'inner', 'Kirk.The', 'aliens', 'are', 'little', 'better', 'manage', 'fly', 'light', 'years', 'Earth', 'then', 'have', 'communications', 'ship', 'get', 'destroyed', 'when', 'hitting', 'satellite', 'final', 'approach', 'goal', 're-establish', 'communications', 'home', 'world', 'do', 'not', 'learn', 'right', 'away', 'First', 'are', 'left', 'guessing', 'what', 'invaders', 'only', 'fire', 'ships', 'first', 'fired', 'then', 'learn', 'somehow', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'ships', 'are', 'not', 'actually', 'firing', 'course', 'lead', 'up', 'scene', 'are', 'actually', 'playing', 'Battleship', 'aliens', 'anticipating', 'blind', 'shots', 'calling', 'out', 'hit', 'miss', 'find', 'out', 'conflict', 'not', 'simple', 'misunderstanding', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'sort', 'mind', 'meld', 'alien', 'just', 'happen', 'find', 'floating', 'sea', 'vision', 'conducting', 'invasion', 'when', 'aliens', 'lizard', 'eyes', 'how', 'learn', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'bright', 'light', 'still', 'insight', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'anything', 'not', 'presenting', 'immediate', 'threat', '.Back', 'goal', 'getting', 'communications', 'established', 'home', 'world', 'Why', 'such', 'concern', 'side', 'Obviously', 'aliens', 'already', 'know', 'where', 'Earth', 'Are', 'not', 'able', 'send', 'more', 'ships', 'advance', 'scouts', 'what', 'are', 'reporting', 'back', 'first', 'why', 'do', 'main', 'characters', 'think', 'threat', 'ended', 'aliens', 'can', 'not', 'transfer', 'message', 'not', 'was', 'random', 'encounter', 'followed', 'instructions', 'given', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Given', 'situation', 'can', 'not', 'assume', 'following', 'waves', 'are', 'not', 'end', 'interesting', 'action', 'sequences', 'movie', 'much', 'greater', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'virtually', 'big', 'budget', 'alien', 'invasion', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'Any', 'alien', 'invasion', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'enemy', 'simply', 'bombard', 'planet', 'space', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'one', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'elements', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'well', 'thought', 'out']",N/A

Admitidly, given the lack of buzz about it when it came out, I saw it with low expectations but I was genuinely entertained by it. There are a couple of big laughs at the start and then when the action kicks in some tense passages and some surprises. Sure it's predictable but the significant adjustments needed to boost the board game origins into a full scale film were in my opinion quite well done. Obviously you need to suspend belief about various things, but if you can accept an alien invasion you can live with the other major credibility leaps too. Indeed, if you insist on your viewing following completely logical paths you should probably stick to documentaries.I thought the actors did a sound job, they kept things moving and looked the part. The aliens looked fine, and were quite inscrutable at times. The special effects were quite good indeed and some of the big scenes were quite spectacular. I liked the pumping sound-track too! There were some clever historical references and some pleasing character interactions. There are a few cheesy moments but it's in keeping with the film not taking itself too seriously.

Now we cut to a man named Alex (Taylor Kitsch, ""John Carter"") at a bar with his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard, ""Melancholia""), after Alex's failed attempt at impressing a girl at the bar named Sam (Brooklyn Decker, ""Just Go With It"") ends up getting an ultimatum from Stone, either join the Navy or else.So some time later we cut to both brothers in the Navy, Alex is together with Sam (some guys have all the luck) and along with the Shane (Liam Neeson, ""Taken"") the Admiral of the entire fleet. After some more exposition while out at sea some aliens decide to attack various locations around the world. These attackers are obviously from this planet G and Shane along with his sailors must do their best to turn back this attack and drive the aliens out of our world.There's some good humor in this one, of course a lot of it is unintentional thanks to the complete and utter ridiculous nature of the film. Its based on the popular family game in name only as I don't recall ever saying ""Aliens sunk my battleship"", the budget is enormous just over $200 million, the cast is decent even including singer Rihanna, the story is so bad but honestly its also an entertaining mess.I do credit the filmmakers for working with actual Naval officers to lend some more realism to this flick, even having a good amount of actual Navy members as part of the cast. This did show that they actually cared about making sure the Naval aspects were accurate and not just made up. Of course that doesn't stop the director and writers from taking liberties with how silly and ludicrious the story and plot is, along with the goofy and stilted dialogue.The cast at least seems to be having fun, though how Neeson was cast in this goofy flick is beyond me, however I must commend them for casting Brooklyn Decker who is just stunningly beautiful.

They're all the same but that doesn't deminish the thrill.SPOILER:If, however, you're looking for something to engage the mind, forget it. A glaring example: the entire plot centers on aliens, having arrived on Earth but having lost their long distance communications ship (so they can signal back to their home planet to send the entire invasion force), gets wrecked before landing. Instead they take over a ground station for the orbiting satellite that sent an initial message from Earth out into deep space that first attracted the alien's attention. They plan to call home using it to start the full invasion. Yet not once in the entire film does anyone say ""look, if they need that satellite of ours to get the signal home, why don't we just retask it to a different orbit where it won't connect to the ground station and they won't be able to send their message? Or why not just shoot it down? Either way, problem solved.""

American and Japanese naval officers have to fight off an alien invasion. Battleship is a big, expensive, ponderous spectacle. It feels like a big budget Asylum movie or a Michael Bay film. The alien beings that the Battleship crew fights are very one dimensional. This feels like a 1950's style alien invader film made in 2012. Still, this movie is fun if you turn your brain off. The visual effects are solid. The chicken burrito theft scene was funny. It was a shot for shot spoof of a real life liquor store robbery recorded on CCTV. Battleship is packed with product placement. I saw the Subway logo three times. The aliens in the film use giant orbs with razors. The orbs slice through cars, helicopters, bridges and ships.

This movie has been maligned by professional critics and everyday people who review, and I watched carefully for that AHA, they were right, moment. I LOVED it all over again! Two hours of rollicking good sci fi fun that I unashamedly enjoyed as much this time as the first time. I guess I will never understand when people stopped laughing and enjoying a simple, old fashioned good guys vs. bad guys movie (I reference The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger) and simply enjoyed it for what it was - fun with no apparent relevance. I stand by this review and ask anyone who reads this to let go and stop looking for trouble where there is none!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I live in Maine. I have watched dozens of movies supposedly taking place in New England. I've had to suspend my better judgement as I recognize over and over, Vancouver, CA, Oregon or Washington being passed off as New England. If you ARE from New England, you know darn well the movie or show you are watching does NOT take place in New England. This is a bit of information for those of you who are either in the military (and, mind you, we are retired military and strongly support you), or are die-hard sci-fi geeks who have whined on and on about how ""unreal"" this movie is. For crying out loud. Can you NOT suspend your beliefs for 90 minutes and just enjoy a good old fashioned shoot 'em up, yay for us as we take on and win against all odds a bunch of obviously better equipped aliens?I LOVED this movie. It was fun. It gave you time to get to know and like the characters. I'm not stupid - I certainly saw many of the errors and problems pointed out by those of you who are so depressed by today's miserable issues or whatever that you cannot just sit back, buy some popcorn and a soda and enjoy this movie for what it is? Just a fun movie for families and people of all ages, full of excitement, good guys vs. bad guys, very funny moments, and some hot guys for us ladies to drool over in the process. OF COURSE, I had to suspend belief that Alex Harper would have even made it into the military with his background (not!), that a bunch of ships out for an international exercise would be armed to the teeth (not!), that there was no way in heck the few ships caught in the dome with some really vicious aliens had a snowball's chance in heck of winning (not!).But you know what? I wasn't WATCHING this movie for realism. I wasn't watching this movie for some deep political statement. I wasn't watching this movie for a message that war is bad and peace is good. I watched it to escape reality and have a lot of fun. Something I haven't done at the movies for a very long time. The language wasn't terrible, the acting (yummy Taylor Kitsch!!) was great, the movie was well cast, a little romance thrown in. I laughed, I found myself at the end of the movie after what seemed like 5 minutes (what we call a 5-minute show - it's so good you lose all track of time and it seems like it's over in 5 minutes as opposed to most shows and movies today that have me looking at the clock and thinking ""oh my gosh, only 15 minutes has gone by???"") wishing I could watch it for the first time all over again.Seriously, people need to lighten up and just have some fun. Especially today. The world isn't such a great place right now and I am smart enough to know too much about just how bad things are.I almost passed this movie up because it only had three stars! If I were deciding whether or not to watch this movie based on most reviews, I definitely would have passed it up. I AM HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND TO SUSPEND YOUR LIFE AND REALITY FOR THIS MOVIE AND WATCH IT! DO NOT let the negative reviews stop you from watching what is almost an old fashioned shoot 'em up movie with really great characters and actors, heart-stopping action scenes and almost too true CGI scenes. Three of us watched it together and we all said the same thing at the end - we LOVED it and we're REALLY glad we didn't let the reviews stop us from watching it. Like I said, I'm used to having to suspend belief - you have NO IDEA how many times they've shown our local airport, our little town, our coast - and those of us who live here (on the East Coast) know darn well it's been filmed out on the West Coast - they look NOTHING alike. Suspension of belief comes easy for us. Lighten up and let this movie take you away for an hour and a half or so for some really great action filled fun!",5,GOOD OLD FASHIONED ALIEN INVASION - WELL DONE,1346544000,"09 2,

1471506,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B005LAIHPE,Kevin Killian,"[0, 0]","Started watching Battleship, drawn to it by its reputation as the biggest box office flop of the past five years, but I wound up admiring something about the movie and kept it up through the end, eventually luring my wife into watching the last two thirds with me.  We clapped at the end like two total geeks.  But I must say that in the light of day the movie has problems which prevent me from giving it the coveted Killian five stars.  I hate to say it, but Taylor Kitsch, so watchable in Friday Night Lights, has no personality with the short Naval Academy haircut they give him here.  Did his long twin swoops of side hair as Tim Riggins give him the shadow he needs to act?  Here, he's playing the same exact part--the handsome screwup who's throwing his life away, plagued by a difficult relationship with a distant older brother--and he's letting himself be a parody of Tim Riggins.  Even Riggins wouldn't have cut through the roof of that 7-11 to get the girl a chicken burrito.  And as others have said, how on earth did he get a berth in the Officers' training school or whatever it's called, with that track record, and how did he manage to turn himself around in what looks like six months of movie time, to become the greatest warrior the Navy's ever known?  OK, so that part is ludicrous, but I'm blaming it on the stylist who made Taylor Kitsch's face so glowy and blushy he doesn't even have any expressions.  Apparently Peter Berg, Kitsch's director in both this movie and on FNL, thinks he has it in him to be the new Channing Tatum, but I don't think so.  He needs new material--no, he needs the same old material, long hair, return to the Dillon Panthers, driving that truck, maybe taking over the coach's role at the high school when Coach moves to Nashville with Connie Britton on her new show.Another one dragged along into Battleship from Friday Night Lights is Jesse Plemons, and HE'S playing the same part he had too---the sleepy-eyed towhead sidekick who inexplicably wins the attentions of the hottest chick within miles--in this case, Rihanna of all people!  Plemons' stuttering and nervous tics bring to mind a degraded and country version of oldtime comic standby Jack Lemmon from those Billy Wilder films, but without the timing or the glibness.  He just stands around looking dumb and Rihanna gives her heart to him like he's Chris Brown.  Well, I didn't buy it!  However, Rihanna is terribly good in this show and in fact may be the best actor in it--outside of the Japanese guy and the man who has just little rods for legs, whom we figured was CGI at first but then we thought, OMG, that may be his actual body!  Either way he's pretty stoic.  Hamish Linklater, who plays the ambitious news producer on Newsroom who fabricates the Genoa scandal, here takes the old Jeff Goldblum role from Jurassic Park, except nerdier.  He's not bad either, though we couldn't figure out how he came up with the big reveal about the aliens' weakness.  Truth is, on the home screen perhaps Battleship loses a few points.  You couldn't see the aliens' awesome superweapon all that well--it looked like the whirling gizmo of gears that Pinhead employed in all the old 80s and 90s Clive Barker films--hovering ominously, then skeetering over surfaces and carving them up then briskly looking for a new target.I thought the good guys were going to harness the energy or instruction manual for those ball machines, and use them to carve up the protective fortress of plastic that the aliens had whipped up to isolate them in.  What happened to that plot development, eh?  Maybe they were saving that for Battleship 2: Balls in Our Court....  but due to the failure of Part One, it will never come to pass.",4,The Name of the Game,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,3720,"['Started', 'watching', 'Battleship', 'drawn', 'reputation', 'biggest', 'box', 'office', 'flop', 'past', 'five', 'years', 'wound', 'up', 'admiring', 'something', 'movie', 'kept', 'up', 'end', 'eventually', 'luring', 'wife', 'watching', 'last', 'two', 'thirds', 'clapped', 'end', 'two', 'total', 'geeks', 'must', 'say', 'light', 'day', 'movie', 'problems', 'prevent', 'giving', 'coveted', 'Killian', 'five', 'stars', 'hate', 'say', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'so', 'watchable', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'personality', 'short', 'Naval', 'Academy', 'haircut', 'give', 'here', 'Did', 'long', 'twin', 'swoops', 'side', 'hair', 'Tim', 'Riggins', 'give', 'shadow', 'act', 'Here', 'playing', 'same', 'exact', 'part', 'handsome', 'screwup', 'who', 'throwing', 'life', 'away', 'plagued', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'distant', 'older', 'brother', 'letting', 'be', 'parody', 'Tim', 'Riggins', 'Even', 'Riggins', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'cut', 'roof', '7-11', 'get', 'girl', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'how', 'earth', 'did', 'get', 'berth', 'Officers', 'training', 'school', 'whatever', 'called', 'track', 'record', 'how', 'did', 'manage', 'turn', 'around', 'what', 'six', 'months', 'movie', 'time', 'become', 'greatest', 'warrior', 'Navy', 'ever', 'known', 'OK', 'part', 'ludicrous', ""'m"", 'blaming', 'stylist', 'who', 'made', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'face', 'so', 'glowy', 'blushy', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'expressions', 'Apparently', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Kitsch', 'director', 'movie', 'FNL', 'be', 'new', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'new', 'material', 'same', 'old', 'material', 'long', 'hair', 'return', 'Dillon', 'Panthers', 'driving', 'truck', 'maybe', 'taking', 'over', 'coach', 'role', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'Coach', 'Nashville', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'new', 'show.Another', 'one', 'dragged', 'Battleship', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Jesse', 'Plemons', 'HE', 'playing', 'same', 'part', 'had', 'too', '-the', 'sleepy-eyed', 'towhead', 'sidekick', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'attentions', 'hottest', 'chick', 'miles', 'case', 'Rihanna', 'people', 'Plemons', 'stuttering', 'nervous', 'tics', 'bring', 'mind', 'degraded', 'country', 'version', 'oldtime', 'comic', 'standby', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Billy', 'Wilder', 'films', 'timing', 'glibness', 'just', 'around', 'looking', 'dumb', 'Rihanna', 'heart', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'Well', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'However', 'Rihanna', 'terribly', 'good', 'show', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'Japanese', 'guy', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'little', 'rods', 'legs', 'whom', 'figured', 'was', 'CGI', 'first', 'then', 'thought', 'OMG', 'may', 'be', 'actual', 'body', 'way', 'pretty', 'stoic', 'Hamish', 'Linklater', 'who', 'ambitious', 'news', 'producer', 'Newsroom', 'who', 'Genoa', 'scandal', 'here', 'old', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'role', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'nerdier', 'not', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'big', 'reveal', 'aliens', 'weakness', 'Truth', 'home', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'Battleship', 'few', 'points', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'aliens', 'awesome', 'superweapon', 'well', 'looked', 'whirling', 'gizmo', 'gears', 'Pinhead', 'employed', 'old', '80s', '90s', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'films', 'hovering', 'ominously', 'then', 'skeetering', 'surfaces', 'carving', 'up', 'then', 'briskly', 'looking', 'new', 'target.I', 'thought', 'good', 'guys', 'were', 'going', 'harness', 'energy', 'instruction', 'manual', 'ball', 'machines', 'use', 'carve', 'up', 'protective', 'fortress', 'plastic', 'aliens', 'had', 'whipped', 'up', 'isolate', 'What', 'happened', 'plot', 'development', 'eh', 'Maybe', 'were', 'saving', 'Battleship', '2', 'Balls', 'Court', 'due', 'failure', 'Part', 'One', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'pass']",N/A

Said signal, as some say will happen, some don't, brings those 'other worlders' to our world.

I can understand making considered complaints about a movie, making points about problems with movies or books.

Come on people, get a life. . .There are a lot of things to like about this movie, if you take it in the vein in which it is intended. It is a shoot-em-up alien blockbuster. And, it includes a POSITIVE look at the Navy, which is really cool. Our soldiers put themselves in horrible positions, give up their lives, and we treat them horribly and pay them less than minimum wage for doing it. They deserve to show their stuff.

1471542,A2W00XKTTF1G0Z,B005LAIHPE,"Lorenzo M. in the Hollywood CA Area ""Movie Wa...","[3, 8]","MOVIE REVIEW #33 : "" Battleship ""Hasbro and director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) are on their way to bring another commercial product to life - this one loosely tries to give you the feel of two enemies battling for their survival. There are Aliens from another galaxy battling and a Navel `maneuvers' event (with several nations competing) that turns into a literally ""battle for the survival planet Earth"". There really is no reason given, motivation presented or even a hint at why the aliens are doing what their doing - but I guess you are supposed to `go with it'. Okeydokey!With really no true story running through this film, writers Eric Hoeber and Jon Hoeber (Red, Whiteout) tried to develop a relationship with two brothers and an apparently disapproving father-in-law-to-be and make that the emotional core of the film. It just doesn't work for me. A wedding where the groom can't even ask the father permission to marry his daughter - because his is the Admiral of the fleet! More than a little shallow and superficial - the story really becomes interesting in one way - the Battles.The saving grace of the film is the fast action of the aliens, their technology and how the earth sea vessels and aircraft fight this extremely powerful and strong Earth invasion. The special effects and tactical planning of the attacks on both sides is engaging and candy for the eye. Really the movie becomes quite interesting - if completely illogical - when the humans and aliens make their attempts to achieve military control of a communications satellite array in Hawaii.There are some good performances by the two brothers played by Taylor Kitsch (John Carter, X-Men: Origins) and Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood, Straw Dogs) who lead the pack in the adventure that seems forever foreboding. Pop singer Rihanna makes her screen debut in this film and she does quite a good job as a tough, go-getting navel navigator. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Taken) does what I call a ""cameo"" appearance as the father (and Fleet Admiral) of the love interest and motivating factor for the youngest brother (Kitsch) - Brooklyn Decker (Just Go With It) artfully plays her role with clever wit.Overall...the ""Grid"" they use to simulate the original Hasbro BATTLESHIP board game is actually cleverly designed as a plotting coordinates made by ocean buoy's in the see. Of course The end sequence is kind of clever - yet completely non-realistic - but involved the decommissioned USS Missouri in Hawaii. I won't tell you what happens...but it was both patriotic and slightly heartwarming.This is defiantly a film with good action and special effects. There is no meat in the story and really nothing to do but just enjoy the special effects ride. I think kids will enjoy it - past the first half hour...and those that are fans of Navel Military vessels will love this film. Otherwise, it really candy for the eyes and a good thrill ride - did I mention the first 30 minutes? Zzzzzzzz. It tries to be more than what it is....but it is nothing more than a series of good special effects action sequences strung together with a small - but big - objective - save Earth!",3,"They Sunk Their Battleship!

1471552,A3178K9AHMHCQV,B005LAIHPE,Luminus,"[3, 5]","""We're going in... full attack....  That's an order.""I was lured into watching this film by the fairly high rating on amazon.com.  It should be noted that as of right now you can't actually rent this movie, which might be an indication as to the ""enjoyability"" of the film.  That's just a wild guess born out of suspicion, by the way.  So, buy it I did, and boy what a waste of money it turned out to be.  I didn't not like it, per se, but I didn't like it either; hence the 2 1/2 stars.The move starts off telling us that when scientists discovered an earth like planet in the Gliese system, NASA built the most advanced communication satellite ever so that they could send a message there.  Why NASA would do this, seeing how an earth like planet does not automatically mean life let alone intelligent life, is beyond me.  But, hey, it's just entertainment, right?  Unfortunately, the film is just not entertaining enough to ignore the many flaws.There's a whole comical scene in the beginning, involving a slacker named Alex Hopper who's rooming with Alexander Skarsgard (who's performance is shockingly terrible here).  I use comical in a bad sense here because it is not at all funny.  Alex meets physiotherapist Samantha Shane at a bar/restaurant and tries to talk to her.  To make a long story short, he makes a deal to get 5 minutes of her time, if he gets her a chicken sandwich (the bartender/chef refuses to make one).  Alex breaks into a gas station store and hilarity ensues to the tune of the Pink Panther theme.  Horrible.  Why isn't Alex in jail after breaking into the store or even let into the Navy after that stunt is never explained.  There are other parts of the movie like this where the jokes just fall flat.  Like the incredibly nerdy scientist (what's with Hollywood and nerdy scientists?) who thought the 1-emotion (deadpan) double-amputee black guy, Mick Canales, was a cyborg.  A cyborg, I kid you not.Rihanna was pointless.  It must have been some attempt to create another Vasquez from Aliens, but fails horribly.  They actually gave her the hero's final line.  You know, the yippeekayay moment and it was horrible.  Why is she the only woman on the ship, anyway?  Speaking of ships, the alien ship jumps in and out of water like a grasshopper.  Why?  It's not stated.  I guess just to give us something ""visually stunning"" to look at, but it just looked stupid to me.Anyway, the aliens look like ogres with spiky beards.  Real original there, Hollywood (sarcasm).  There's no indication what the aliens want, by the way, except for some psychic bond one has with Alex for no reason whatsoever.  I guess they wanted an Independence Day moment, but fails because instead of Alex telling us what the aliens want based on the flashes, he just says he has a feeling about them.  Well, I guess, since I don't know what they want either based on that jumbled mess.  It looked like the aliens were at war with each other, then came here to destroy our technology and infrastructure for no reason at all.  None of the weapons or aliens ever targeted people, unless threatened.  Get it, like the Borg?  From this psychic link, Alex deduces that they want our planet or themselves.  Why Alex?  Can you elaborate?  No?  Are you at least empathetic enough to save the sailors in the water, without having to be told to?  No?  Okay, moving along.It's possible to deduce that the aliens destroyed their planet, or were destroying it, and sent out a scout party to look for another planet to live on.  Putting aside the logic that an alien race wouldn't send a military unit to do this (you need scientist for this job, Hollywood.  do'h), it still doesn't make any sense.  War destroyed your planet and your solution to this is to start another war with another species on another planet?  Riiight.This brings me to the point of not caring about a single person in this film.  Liam Neeson?  Wasted.  Louis Lombardi  (Edgar from 24) and Peter C. MacNicol (Janosz from Ghostbusters and Tom Lennox from 24)?  Wasted.And then there's Cal(sp?) the scientist.  This is like the pinnacle of nerdy scientist ever.  But this is nerdy to the point of mind-numbingly annoying.  This is the guy who makes the cyborg comment I mentioned earlier.  This is a winy little annoying uber dork who runs away from the fight, because he thinks its safe, and takes his suitcase with him.  Do you see what's coming?  I won't spoil it.  It's just too laughably ridiculous.Nice to see a shot of a Buddha statue instead of Jesus in a film, though.  It didn't get destroyed, though.  I guess it's not shocking enough to Hollywood for us to see the symbol of other people's beliefs being annihilated before our very eyes.  But maybe that's over-analyzing.  I'm not Buddhist, by the way.So, to help you decide whether you want to watch or not:1) Characters are pointless and their deaths don't matter to me2) Aliens have no real motive and aren't interesting.  They also never talk.3) Bad comedy4) Boring first half5) Moronic hero6) The ""S"" word is used a couple of times, while the ""M"" word is half said at least twice)7) Acceptable musical scoreIf you like empty movies like Underworld, Resident Evil and Transformers II & III (the Transformers movies are better than this), then you'll probably enjoy this.  Everyone else stay away.  (Yes, I gave Transformers I a pass.

1471560,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B005LAIHPE,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[278, 330]","This film has for only purpose to entertain us and in this aspect it is highly succesful. The main hero is very likeable, the leading girl charming, the display of military hardware impressive, the aliens naughty (and ugly and stupid!), the scenario doesn't make much sense, the CGI effects are EXCELLENT, US Navy is the best, US government is incompetent - in one word, everything is as it should be in a movie made to go nicely with your popcorn on a Friday evening. WARNING! Some SPOILERS incoming at six o'clock!The main hero, Lt. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a troubled young man who after messing up a lot in his early life finally joined the US Navy and by some extraordinary miracle managed to become an officer in charge of weapons on board of USS ""John Paul Jones"", a very powerful destroyer of ""Arleigh Burke"" class. He is however poorly noted by his superiors and is generally considered as a disappointment and a failure. The unexpected alien invasion during a naval exercice will suddenly force him to take command (""Who is in charge now?"" ""Hopper!"" ""We are so dead!"") and lead his men into a particularly deadly fight against a vicious and resourceful enemy.Other than his messy life style Alex Hooper has also another ""problem"" - his gorgeous, sculpturally beautiful girlfriend Samantha (Brooklyn Decker). She loves him, he loves her and they are engaged to be married - but her father hates his guts and for reasons which you will have to discover yourself his agreement to their marriage actually matters...Other characters are also important: Alex's brother, Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard) who is the older, responsible and organised version of Alex; Vice-Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), tough, impressive commander in chief of US Pacific Fleet; Japanese Navy Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano), commanding the Japanese destroyer ""Myoko"" and Lt. Colonel (Retired) Mick Canales (Gregory D. Gadson), a bitter US Army veteran who lost his both legs in one of recent American wars.Rihanna makes her movie debut in this film, as Petty Officer Cora Raikes, a weapon specialist and crew member on board of USS ""John Paul Jones"", serving under Alex Hopper orders. She has a lot of screen time and she is VERY good! I was very pleasantly surprised by her acting and I am looking forward to see her in more films.The display of modern weaponry is very impressive. 5-inch guns and 20mm Phalanx CIWS (Close-in Weapon System), ""Harpoon"" missiles and 324 mm torpedoes of American and Japanese destroyers are used generously and they give a great show. And once the old battleship USS ""Missouri"" enters in action with her 16-inch big guns, things get even better!The aliens are very very agressive and naughty - although to be fair, they seem to avoid the colateral damage as much as possible, by sparing the obviously harmless oponents. They also try to rescue their own soldiers taken prisoner, which is something not so frequent in SF films. Other than that they are the ""standard issue"" aliens: ugly, hostile, technologically advanced in some fields but limited in others (they do not seem to grasp fully the concept of guided weapons) and last but not least abysmally, galactically, terminally stupid! BUT, in this film it actually is an asset, because it allows USS ""Missouri"" to engage the alien flagship in a way which reminds of the bloody and dramatic fight between HMS ""Victory"" and ""Redoutable"" at Trafalgar...The scenario doesn't make much sense as for the reasons for this invasion which seems ultimately to be just a reconnaissance. The reason for the attack on Oahu island and the whole battle around it are even more ludicrous - as for the whole ""saving the world"" thing, let's just throw a veil of silence on it... A civilization able to send a scouting military expedition of five ships through interstellar space, can always send a second one, stronger and better prepared. So, there is a possibility of a sequel.The CGI effects are really EXCELLENT! Alien ships and weapons are very well done, fights are very ""realistic"" and visually the film is a big success.All fighting men and women of US forces (and the one lonely Japanese guy) are shown as heroes fighting to the end at the best of their capacities, engaging enemy with missiles first, handguns second and iron bars and bare fists after that, if necessary. In contrast, the US government is (of course!) completely incompetent, which is only normal, considering that it is chaired by a Secretary of Defense played by Peter MacNicol (yes, you read well!).So, all in all, it is a rather succesful, quite entertaining film, with lots of good special effects, lots of good fights, two well playing hot chicks (Brooklyn Decker and Rihanna), some handsome men, a very stupid scenario, quite a lot of humour, at least one very touching moment and one very VERY dearly paid chicken burito...))) I had lots of fun watching it, although I am aware of its weaknesses - and I think that if all you need is some harmless entertainment, you will like it too.

1471562,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B005LAIHPE,MadMacs,"[1, 2]","Essentially a kid's comic book with the accompanying level of depth, expectation or creativity. I suspect if I were 12 and under - this might be the perfect summer movie.However, that said, it had very brief moments of fun, primarily as the 'teams' begin to play Battleship with real ships.Was quite fascinated with the aliens, appreciated that they were humanoid. Mildly bored with screening ETs represented by various Geiger-inspired slippery insectile and tentacled slimy cephalopods. They had a good ride the past ten-fifteen years, time to move onto something new I think.Again, massive plotholes notwithstanding, if you're looking for a kid's movie - this is for you.Movie Notes:- Not sure how many caught Director Peter Berg in a cameo role as a CIC operator. The free-spirited actor/director has shown he can do so much more with the right material. And I hope he's not forced to again draw from the Michael Bay palette.- I'm of the mindset that this is the worst Liam Neeson performance ever. And given his recent string of pay-for-play walkthrough performances, I wonder if he's serious about the craft any longer? Not sure what his effort represents beyond collecting a paycheck.

1471563,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B005LAIHPE,magellan,"[1, 1]","Based loosely on the Hasbro game and concept, this movie takes a little while to get going, but once it does, it's a pretty exciting ride.The movie starts with scientists attempting to send out a deep space signal to another nearby star system to try to communicate. Unfortunately, the aliens turn out to be hostile and decide to home in on earth and conquer it since our two planets are similar and can support the same type of life, perhaps because their planet is dying and they need to find a new home.Most of the psychological tension in the movie is about the relationship between between Liam Neeson, the admiral, and Alex Skarsgard, a bright but ne'er-do-well young officer who wants to marry the admiral's daughter, but the admiral is singularly unimpressed with Skarsgard as a new graduate officer assigned to his battle group. Of course, he saves the day, redeeming himself in the admiral's eyes and gets the hand of the admiral's daughter in marriage after all.That's just the romantic backdrop to the movie, and the rest of the story line in some ways doesn't make much sense, but the action and special effects are what it's all about. For example, the aliens, for all their more advanced technology, are slow to capitalize on their opportunities and often just seem to waste time doing nothing much of the time. Of course, this just gives the humans the needed time to regroup and figure out how to defeat them. They also have the ability to create a large enough force field to cover a considerable area of the ocean, trapping some of the human ships and excluding others, but they don't seem to have the ability to generate a forcefield to protect their individual ships as they are still vulnerable to the humans' guns and missiles. Why the aliens can create such a large force field and not be able to create smaller ones to protect individual ships doesn't make much sense and isn't explained in the movie. But then if that were true the humans wouldn't have had much of a chance at all.The special effects are cool though and the alien technology is superior to ours in many ways, and also different. As one reviewer here mentioned perceptively, they don't seem to understand the concept of a guided missile. Instead, their ships shoot out these giant buzz saw weapons the size of small cars, and only two or three of these can shred a whole ship in a matter of minutes. Military history buffs may remember the British developed something similar during WWII which had a funny name, the Jabberwocky or Hurdy-Gurdy, I don't exactly remember.  But it was a giant rocket propelled wheel designed for use on a beachhead and this was reminiscent of that. The other main weapon the aliens have resembles a ship-to-ship mine which is fired from a launcher and embeds itself in the side of a ship and then explodes. The alien troops also have powered armor--the sort that the mobile infantry should have had in the Starship Troopers movie of some years back (and which was present in the Robert Heinlein novel that the movie was based on).The movie pays homage to the old Missouri battleship which saves the day at the very end of the movie, and is being manned by elderly members of her crew who were there to give the tours and answer questions for the public, a very cool idea. Overall, a fun movie with spectacular CGI special effects and with enough action to be worth your time on a lazy weekend evening.",3,Fun with great special effects ideas,1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,3423,"['Based', 'loosely', 'Hasbro', 'game', 'concept', 'movie', 'little', 'get', 'going', 'once', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'ride.The', 'movie', 'scientists', 'attempting', 'send', 'out', 'deep', 'space', 'signal', 'nearby', 'star', 'system', 'try', 'communicate', 'Unfortunately', 'aliens', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'hostile', 'decide', 'home', 'earth', 'conquer', 'two', 'planets', 'are', 'similar', 'can', 'support', 'same', 'type', 'life', 'perhaps', 'planet', 'dying', 'need', 'find', 'new', 'home.Most', 'psychological', 'tension', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'admiral', 'Alex', 'Skarsgard', 'bright', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'young', 'officer', 'who', 'marry', 'admiral', 'daughter', 'admiral', 'singularly', 'unimpressed', 'Skarsgard', 'new', 'graduate', 'officer', 'assigned', 'battle', 'group', 'course', 'day', 'redeeming', 'admiral', 'eyes', 'hand', 'admiral', 'daughter', 'marriage', 'just', 'romantic', 'backdrop', 'movie', 'rest', 'story', 'line', 'ways', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'what', 'about', 'example', 'aliens', 'more', 'advanced', 'technology', 'are', 'slow', 'capitalize', 'opportunities', 'often', 'just', 'seem', 'waste', 'time', 'doing', 'nothing', 'much', 'time', 'course', 'just', 'humans', 'needed', 'time', 'regroup', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'defeat', 'also', 'have', 'ability', 'create', 'large', 'enough', 'force', 'field', 'cover', 'considerable', 'area', 'ocean', 'trapping', 'human', 'ships', 'excluding', 'others', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'ability', 'generate', 'forcefield', 'protect', 'individual', 'ships', 'are', 'still', 'vulnerable', 'humans', 'guns', 'missiles', 'Why', 'aliens', 'can', 'create', 'such', 'large', 'force', 'field', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'smaller', 'ones', 'protect', 'individual', 'ships', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', ""n't"", 'explained', 'movie', 'then', 'were', 'true', 'humans', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'much', 'chance', 'all.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'cool', 'alien', 'technology', 'superior', 'ours', 'many', 'ways', 'also', 'different', 'one', 'reviewer', 'here', 'mentioned', 'perceptively', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'concept', 'guided', 'missile', 'Instead', 'ships', 'shoot', 'giant', 'buzz', 'saw', 'weapons', 'size', 'small', 'cars', 'only', 'two', 'three', 'can', 'shred', 'whole', 'ship', 'matter', 'minutes', 'Military', 'history', 'buffs', 'may', 'remember', 'British', 'developed', 'something', 'similar', 'WWII', 'had', 'funny', 'name', 'Jabberwocky', 'Hurdy-Gurdy', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'remember', 'was', 'giant', 'rocket', 'propelled', 'wheel', 'designed', 'use', 'beachhead', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'other', 'main', 'aliens', 'have', 'resembles', 'ship-to-ship', 'mine', 'fired', 'launcher', 'side', 'ship', 'then', 'explodes', 'alien', 'troops', 'also', 'have', 'powered', 'armor', 'sort', 'mobile', 'infantry', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'movie', 'years', 'back', 'was', 'present', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'movie', 'was', 'based', '.The', 'movie', 'homage', 'old', 'Missouri', 'battleship', 'day', 'very', 'end', 'movie', 'being', 'manned', 'elderly', 'members', 'crew', 'who', 'were', 'there', 'give', 'tours', 'answer', 'questions', 'public', 'very', 'cool', 'idea', 'Overall', 'fun', 'movie', 'spectacular', 'CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'enough', 'action', 'be', 'time', 'lazy', 'weekend', 'evening']",N/A

But just like with metal (the music genre): there's ""thinking man's metal"" and ""down and dirty, beat you up metal""... This movie is more akin to the latter -just don't think about it.I heard and read about all the angst this movie received from reviewers and even moviegoers.  Now, I'm not saying it's the best thing since ""Citizen Kane"" or something retarded, but this movie is actually pretty good -for a ""turn your brain off, aliens attack, sci-fi flick"" -that involves the U.S. Navy.First off, the movie has some (genuinely) funny moments that don't come across scripted (per se).  Second, the story/plot -while not over emphasizing using all your gray matter to figure out, is simple. Aliens come here, want to take over -we kick their a**! (Well, the U.S. Navy does but still, you get the picture)... Third, Taylor Kitsch isn't Tom Hanks but he did a pretty good job in leading the movie... He may not be a ""name"" star yet, but who cares!?This movie shows the U.S. Navy in a very positive light (similar to ""Top Gun"") and honestly, maybe I'm biased because I'm pro military, but I really believe the negative hype against this movie is undeserved. This isn't a ""perfect"" movie, nor is it a thinking man's movie... It's sci-fi action flick -period.Look, if you believe the hype then don't even watch this movie.  You have to want to give it a chance.  Again, it isn't THE MOST AWE INSPIRING MOVIE EVER MADE, but it is a fun popcorn flick with great special effects and the U.S. Navy kicking some alien butt. This movie is similar to ""Independence Day"" in that respect -don't take it so seriously and look for flaws and plot holes -cause you'll find'em. Enjoy it for what it is.

1471593,A2GWA76TM4DD1N,B005LAIHPE,"Metalhead Jay ""Jason""","[4, 6]","This will be my first and perhaps only movie review and I'll tell you exactly why below. When you're 5 minutes into a flick and you're saying to yourself..this better improve quickly, you know that it's just going to get worse.I was infuriated after wasting my time watching this flick. I thought to myself...Hey, Liam Neeson is in this movie. It can't be too bad, right? WRONG! I honestly think he just showed up for the paycheck here. And considering that he is well off and not hard up for the dough, he should be ashamed of himself. I saw John Carradine in some major stinkers but I can forgive him because he actually needed the money. Now that we've come to the conclusion that this is by far THE worst film Liam Neeson has been in, we shall continue.. This film is everything that is wrong with modern, mainstream American films! They insult our intelligence on so many levels it's ridiculous. Heck, I've had more enjoyment watching bad 80's slashers than this dreck! I can usually turn my brain off with crap like this but not with this particular film. This was like watching one of those ""made for the SyFy channel flicks"" with a huge budget and better special effects. All the worst labels apply to this film basically. Formulaic, generic, manufactured sappiness, bad rock music(they could have at least had Bon Scott era AC/DC!), Overacting, mindless action with no point, overblown special effects and explosions that try to divert you from the lack of any cohesive story, etc..etc.. I can usually forgive one or two of these aspects being attributed to said film in question but this stinker has practically no redeeming value. Unless you're the primitive type that likes to watch rednecks light fireworks for hours on end.And what was up with the cheesy patriotism where we are always the good guys? I felt like I was watching another Conservative propaganda flick like ""Red Dawn"". What is this? A recruitment vehicle for the military? Macho indoctrination for the naive and easily led? And this movie so disrespects WW11 veterans by making them robots that won't question any of the orders they are being given. How about a bit more humanity and intelligence from these characters. My grandfathers who DID fight in WW11 would have been offended by how the veterans are portrayed in this flick. As mere canon fodder for all the awful aspects that films like this represent. If movies like this and bad reality shows continue to grow in popularity, there is absolutely no hope for the future of America. We will become a mindless, consumer society where very few have individual thought, perception, and intellect. And that is exactly what the corrupt among us want. ""1984"". It's an excellent book and a warning to us. Should be required reading in high schools all across this Nation.And now my parting words. Peter Berg should never be allowed to direct again(or at least he should take his name off this flick and apply the Alan Smithee tag) and who ever wrote this script should be prohibited from ever writing ANYTHING! They say a flick like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of the worst movies ever. I so disagree with this assessment. It's movies like ""Battleship"" which are the worst films. At least ""Plan 9"" was amusing, funny, and didn't take itself seriously. I at least can get SOME entertainment value out of that. Not with ""Battleship"" however. This movie was so bad, it was just BAD!!! If you haven't seen this flick, the best advice I can give you is to avoid it at all costs. You can do so much better when it comes to ""Alien invasion"" films. And no, I'm not talking about ""Independence Day"" either. Start with one of the best that has a great message and intelligent story. A flick that doesn't glorify the military/industrial complex. That being the original ""The Day The Earth Stood Still""(1951). Hollywood today could learn alot from classic films like this. Stop dumbing us down, so you can make more profit! Thanks for reading. If I saved one person from seeing ""Battleship"", I will consider this review a job well done!

This one borrows from all the recent alien invasion flicks in many ways but it differs in that it's the Navy that's that's doing hte fighting. The part that probably drove some people mad was they way they used bouys to simulate radar and you had red strikes similiar to the GAME battleship.

The blu ray looks great and this movie had a monster budget, which it didn't make back unfortunately for it's studio. Still The huge budget shows here and the film is a good way to spend a few mindless hours of entertainment.

1471611,A1NIS5QFY6KCT7,B005LAIHPE,Mike the Geology Teacher,"[1, 1]","Battleship is a decent action sci-fi movie with a darn good cast, great special effects and a decent story. Now I'm not going to BS you and say that it had a great screenplay. But, when compared with a lot of other action movies I've seen lately, it's practically Shakespear. The dialogue was was crisp and didn't get lost in technical mumbo jumbo as it might have. I don't remember hearing any profanity. If there was any it just didn't register. So it's pretty suitable for youngsters.The story begins with NASA sending messages of friendship and good will to a newly discovered planet outside our solar system. While this is going on we meet Alex Hopper, a long haired deadbeat with $60 to his name and a Navy officer as an older brother. Alex's brother was played by Alexander Skarsgard, my wife's favorite actor on True Blood. Stone Hopper (Skarsgard) reads his little brother the riot act for being a loser and convinces him to join the Navy and do something with his life.One thing about this movie that impressed me was the timeline. Most sci-fi movies don't take the truly vast distances of space into account. Battlship does by virtue of the fact that the aliens don't respond to NASA's message of friendship for many years. Since it would take 3 or more years for a message to reach another star, that makes sense. Also, it gives Alex time to go to OCS and work his way up to LT in the Navy - 6 or more years.So as the Aliens are preparing respong to NASA greeting with overwhelming force, Alex is preparing to ask Admiral (Liam Neeson) Shane for his daughter's hand in marraige. But before he can do so he gets in a fight with a visiting Japanese officer, and learns that the Navy is tired of his antics and plans to kick him to the curb. But before all that can happen the Aliens launch their attack on various Pacific Ocean targets. Alex and his crew must defend humankind from alien stormtroopers. When the senior officers get killed, Alex becomes commanding officer aboard his ship and takes on the aliens. I'm not going to give the rest of the plot away. But the script is tight, and the ending just what it should be.By the way, a special mention should go to Colonel Gregory Gadson, Army veteran who plays a double amputee who's given up on himself, but finds the strenght to defend America one last time. Gadson, who lost both legs above the knees in Iraq, was offered this role by director Peter Berg. Despite being a professional soldier, not an actor, Gadson brought a real deapth to this character.Battleship did have 2 things going against it. (1) It came out after the mediocre Battle: Loas Angeles and the horrific crapfest that was Skyline.(2) It was marketed as a film adaption of the 1970s game Battleship. Aside from about a 6 minute segment, I didn't see much to connect the movie to the game.Now this movie isn't going to win any awards. I'd imagine that just about every film critic in North America hated it. But it was good clean fun with over the top special effects, but not the bone chilling gore of some movies in the genre.

I also have a vague recollection of playing a version as a kid myself using a pencil and paper but that could be just dead brain cells floating around.  Speaking of dead brain cells...with a movie like ""Battleship"" it is usually a good idea to set the bar low (pick a Michael Bay movie) and just relax.  For me, I use the second ""Transformers"" movie ""Revenge of the Fallen"" as my standard.Here we have some early scenes that actually aren't bad and begin to flesh out the characters.  The focus is on bad boy, Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) who somehow becomes a U. S. Navy officer at the insistence of his big brother, Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) who already is a Commander.  Unless memory again fades, having been in the Navy myself it is unlikely that they would accept a drunken felon into their officer corps (i.e. Alex) but maybe things have changed.While this is a minor nit not worth picking, there are so many other flawed aspects of the film, it can't be taken seriously.  The good news is that the movie is wildly, if absurdly, entertaining.  It is decently constructed with a beginning, middle and an end.

1471624,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B005LAIHPE,Moviedude,"[1, 1]","Battleship is a movie about huge boats with tons of guns blasting the absolute stuffing out of each other. Some of the boats are from space and as a result look all cool and science-fiction-ey, albeit in a somewhat generic way. The alien invaders' ships have a technological edge on Earth's navy, but both fleets are able to deal fairly significant damage to one another. The result is a lot of epic, loud naval combat which is more than a little reminiscent of Japanese nautical adventure comics. Is it then a coincidence that this movie has a prominent Japanese principal (Tadanobu Asano) and premiered in Japan? Surely not. But that's by no means a bad thing- strong foreign cast members and badass naval combat are far too lacking in modern American cinema.The effects for the sea battles are extremely good, and the alien enemies themselves, though rather as generic as their boats, stand out as a high point- they are neither as wantonly evil and bestial as science fiction invaders tend to be, nor as grossly overpowered. When one of their number is captured, they rescue him(?) in a commando raid, and they depend on stealth, sabotage, and cunning to a degree that is usually reserved for the wily human underdogs in such films. Compared to the forgettable Wing Commander movie, in which the noble and cunning Kilrathi were reduced to snarling beast-men with Wolverine claws, the aliens in Battleship are interesting and exciting. They also serve as a warning against dependance on technology over judgment in wartime: most of their blunders result from an over-reliance on friend-or-foe systems in their helmets that allow human combatants to escape certain doom by standing down. This message about brains over science is also played out among the humans themselves- the navy doesn't really clean house until they abandon their modern but technologically vulnerable ships in favor of a thousand tons of antique, cannon-toting battleship (the name has to come in somewhere, right?).So the battleship part of Battleship is a 4 or 5 star film. But it gets dragged down by its opening 30 minutes. These are not exciting, alien battling, swashbuckling, exploding minutes- they are framing in which we learn how our protagonist Taylor Kitsche is a super irresponsible guy who will rob a convenience store to impress a girl (it works). Kitche's character somehow makes second lieutenant in about a year in spite of angering admiral Liam Neeson and constantly disappointing his brother Alexander Skarsgrd, who cannot be bothered to suppress his Swedish accent even when he is playing an all-American military man. This misguided block of exposition is punctuated by irritating editing, poorly selected musical scoring, and an uncanny resemblance to a Red Skelton USO sketch, which I must assume is deliberate, and by extension, a horrible idea. You will have to fight hard to keep watching by the 10 minute mark, and when the aliens finally show up to explode stuff, they sort of feel like the heroes.Pros:-Great effects-Surprisingly plausible interstellar war-Enough sprays of missiles, explosions, and churning engines to please the most jaded anime nerd or dieselpunk aficionadoCons:-Horrible characterization-Awful music choices (the end credits employ CCR's Fortunate Son, which I'm pretty sure is a song about how hard it sucks to be in the military and get ordered around by money men and pencil pushers, and is an odd choice in a film where the heroes fight an unavoidable, self-directed war against a totally clean hostile target)-Odd conclusion (with the alien fleet beaten, EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES EARTH IS SAFE IMMEDIATELY (of course there's a post-credit scene to remind us it totally isn't)Conclusion:Better than any film based on a board game has a right to be, Battleship only hits its mark when the shells are flying, and as a result is an entertaining film but not a very good one.",3,A great naval action film brought down by cringe-inducing everything else,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",2013,3899,"['Battleship', 'movie', 'huge',

In tone, scale and aspiration this is aTransformers Trilogy (Transformers / Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen / Transformers: Dark of the Moon) [Blu-ray] clone - it's even generated by the same toy company, Hasbro.  How you feel about a movie whose success hinges on how good its special effects are and how gorgeous the cast are, above such other criteria such as, say, acting or script, will largely determine how much you enjoy this movie.Plot-wise, slacker Taylor Kitsch has been encouraged to join the Navy by his high performing brother, under the gruff command of Admiral Liam Neeson.  He does this to win the hand of the Admiral's unfeasibly gorgeous daughter who seems to serve no purpose other than wearing ultra tight denim shorts and straddling Taylor in provocative poses, and who is inexplicably drawn to him.  Things get complicated when Aliens land in the ocean next to a huge naval exercise and their intentions are clearly more Decepticon than Autobot...  When the action kicks off, it's all wildly over the top, and yet done with such excellent effects and solid editing (hooray, Michael Bay-like frenetic editing has been dialed down so you can actually see what's going on..) that there's quite a lot of fun to be had.  Rihanna is surprisingly underplayed in a supporting role, Liam Neeson is.. well, Liam Neeson and the rest of the cast ably put Tab A into Slot B for their respective prescribed character developments.As a US Navy propaganda it actually works well, in a Top-Gun-at-sea sort of way. The effects are genuinely quite impressive, with stuff blowing up, vaporizing and blasting around in a way that actually seems to look realistic, even if physicists will struggle not to place their head in their hands and shake it at some of the plot points (why DO radio waves beamed into space need to be a striking white beam of light that zings and shimmers..?).

Gregg,"[0, 0]","Made by the same folks that gave us the TRANSFORMER movies, and given that this movie is similar in nature (mankind vs. alien machine) I think the best way to review this movie for you is to make some comparisons...The story is pretty good, the aliens themselves were no big deal to speak of as they were very similar to bald human males with reptile eyes and 4 fingers for hands (like the claws in those arcade machines where you try to grab a stuffed animal).  Their ships were pretty cool (but unlike ""transformers"" they had no personality and couldn't change into different things) and it was a little disappointing they fired almost ordinary bombs. There were some smaller ships that were fairly unique and deadly.The camera work was the same as in the Transformers movies, where in the heat of action they are in too tight and you mostly just get to see blur instead of the orchestrated/choreographed action (and I always hate when movies do that).I think the main problem with this movie is that you just don't really care about the main character - he's an idiot, lacking charm/personality and often intelligence/maturity. And truthfully, I think the blame for it is more the actor than the script. But it's a big problem for a movie when they can't get you to like the main characters. (The black woman who fires the ships weapons was very good, and so was the big black Army guy with the steel legs -- they were smaller supporting roles, but you like and care about them).Overall it was disappointing but not horrible because some parts of this were pretty cool, but it's not one I'd recommend or care to watch again myself.

It had corny dialogue, irritating shakey cam, and a plot line you didn't want to spend any brain power to decipher.  'Battleship' thought makes Battle:LA look like 'Battleship Potemkin' in comparison. One of the most poorly executed films of the year, 'Battleship' will certainly find a home in some future 'Mystery Science Theater' show or midnight cult classic screening. If only it took itself a little less seriously and ramped up the humor, it could have been a perfect 'park your brains in neutral' hoot.The film will probably find it's audience anyway among the perpetual 8-years olds among us and might even make back the obscenely large amount of cash it cost to produce. The script is awful and the acting is wooden and embarrassing. Watch Liam Neeson stumbled throught this film and feel sorry for him. Count up the bad lines written into the script and feel pity for the actors.  Luckily the use of CGI is very good  Water effects are very difficult to do. We have seen this CGI before but love for cinema visual trickery will still has us thrilled with the scenes of battles on the ocean between the US Navy and invading aliens.The non-actors, or perhaps they are actual Navy vets that were recruited to play battleship on the USS Missouri were also fun to watch.  They outshined the regular cast by their mere presence and physical reality.We also should celebrate the presence of another of the film's standout performance, so to speak, that of Brooklyn Decker's chest. It should have gotten an ending credit in itself.This film 'Battleship' is what happens when you attempt to base a movie on a board game. No story, no character, and enough plot holes to drive a battleship through. Suprisingly enough  the producers manage to insert the actual board game into the plot near the end of the film about some sort of grid-like tsunami warning system which will have most of the more knowledgeable audience members scratching their heads in disbelief at its sheer stupidity. But hey, after the opening scenes comical missteps, we could believe anything. 'Battleship' is filled with military errrors. It is the type of film that would have actual Navy personnel rolling in the aisles watching all the mistakes make about military life. Incredulity begins almost immediately after the start of the film when we are offered a lengthy barroom brawl, car chase, break-in sequence with Taylor Kitsch in search of a chicken taco which would then have us believe that Taylor Kitsch could then joins the Navy as an officer and in the next scene (with little of no time transition) appears to us as a Navy lieutenant.

Not that there is much in the way of things that could be said and be considered spoilers, but I'll keep my description brief anyway. Basically, the misfit brother of a Naval officer gets arrested trying to steal a chicken burrito for the uber hot chica in the flick and is basically forced to enlist in the NAvy himself where he is made an officer. Of course, things happen (namely an alien invasion) and said misfit ends up as the ranking officer in the arena, where he, his crew, and a few other people are forced to squash said alien invasion by themselves. Now, you basically know the entire plotline, lol.So, why did I enjoy this movie? Many reason actually. It was a big, visually pleasing movie. The battles between the human and alien ships were super cool, and the alien technology in particular was really neat and very devastating. The aliens themselves were pretty well thought out in a slightly more advanced than, but not completely dissimilar to humanity sort of way. Their armor in particular was quite reminiscent of the Mjolnir armor from the Halo game series. The interaction between the characters was also pretty funny, and there were plenty of enjoyable moments in that regard. The cast was spot on, and was tailored to a younger crowd. From o-boy of John Carter fame to Rihanna, there was plenty to relate to, and for us older folks, well...there was Liam Neeson and a whole host of crotchety old navy shipmen. The audio for the movie was also quite big, and completely complimentary to the visuals. Last, the way in which they tied the battle structure in the movie to that of the game itself was very cool.So, while not a writers opus, this movie was certainly enjoyable, and I think you will have found your time to be well spent.Enjoy!",5,A fun factor 5 star affair,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,1874,"['give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'strictly', 'fun', 'factor', 'alone', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'not', 'lose', 'anywhere', 'Not', 'much', 'way', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'be', 'considered', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'description', 'brief', 'anyway', 'Basically', 'misfit', 'brother', 'Naval', 'officer', 'arrested', 'trying', 'steal', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'uber', 'hot', 'chica', 'flick', 'basically', 'forced', 'enlist', 'NAvy', 'where', 'made', 'officer', 'course', 'things', 'happen', 'namely', 'alien', 'invasion', 'said', 'misfit', 'up', 'ranking', 'officer', 'arena', 'where', 'crew', 'few', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'forced', 'squash', 'said', 'alien', 'invasion', 'Now', 'basically', 'know', 'entire', 'plotline', 'lol.So', 'why', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'Many', 'reason', 'actually', 'was', 'big', 'visually', 'pleasing', 'movie', 'battles', 'human', 'alien', 'ships', 'were', 'super', 'cool', 'alien', 'technology', 'particular', 'was', 'really', 'neat', 'very', 'devastating', 'aliens', 'were', 'pretty', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'slightly', 'more', 'advanced', 'not', 'completely', 'dissimilar', 'humanity', 'sort', 'way', 'armor', 'particular', 'was', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'Mjolnir', 'armor', 'Halo', 'game', 'series', 'interaction', 'characters', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'funny', 'were', 'plenty', 'enjoyable', 'moments', 'regard', 'cast', 'was', 'spot', 'was', 'tailored', 'younger', 'crowd', 'o-boy', 'John', 'Carter', 'fame', 'Rihanna', 'was', 'plenty', 'relate', 'older', 'folks', 'well', 'was', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'whole', 'host', 'crotchety', 'old', 'navy', 'shipmen', 'audio', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'big', 'completely', 'complimentary', 'visuals', 'Last', 'way', 'tied', 'battle', 'structure', 'movie', 'game', 'was', 'very', 'cool.So', 'not', 'writers', 'opus', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'found', 'time', 'be', 'well', 'spent.Enjoy']",N/A

However, the movie has no focus, no real story and felt incomplete. I got bored halfway through. I've seen thousands of movies and many action, alien, alien invader movies. Not all of them are good, not all bad. Great special effects are a dime a dozen nowadays. I expect an at least plausible story. This movie doesn't explain anything about the aliens' purpose. They came to destroy the earth?  Not evident here. They just 'crash' on earth. Then an irritating lead Navy character does something stupid, as they have him do from film's beginning, and then fighting begins. And I notice the battles are instigated mostly by humans. Ok. Give me a reason to root for the good guys. I mean, the aliens even scan humans and refuse to kill them. What exactly is going on? Once again not explained. It almost seemed like the aliens here are accidental bad guys. There's a point in the movie that a guy says that we're facing an extinction level event. What event exactly? They still don't explain it. Did the writers say to themselves that, to the audience, aliens automatically equal bad guys we have to destroy? No explanation needed? Ah no. Independence Day,  Predator, War of the Worlds, Alien, Close Encounters, E.T., Transformers. All alien stories. All with a clear purpose and determination of good or bad and motive. No such thing in this. I wasn't even invested in the human characters. The only one wad the main lead who was an irresponsible idiot that was made into a paper hero.

The main character is pretty flat, even with the attempt at making him three-dimensional - but it didn't really matter because it was plenty enough for us to root for him.*** mini-spoilers ahead:  ***As to the complaints about the aliens being ""dumb"", one character notes more than once that it's as if they are Chris Columbus coming to America and we're the ""Indians"".  So... think about it.  When the Europeans came to the Americas, they didn't try to kill everyone.  They came and if the native people were nice, other than disease, they left it alone more or less.  But if the natives were aggressive then they were attacked.  If you pay attention you'll notice the aliens don't shoot first.  I thought of it as the aliens were making some attempt at peaceful approach but fought to stay alive, and were individuals in that some were trigger happy and others were possibly pacifist and maybe don't agree with the alien invasion plans... maybe that's why... well you'll see.*** end spoilers ***Last note:  Don't miss the end of the credits.  ;-)",4,Better than you think,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,1235,"['better', 'movie', 'might', 'think', 'very', 'successful', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'three-star', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'execution', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'effects', 'are', 'spot', 'main', 'character', 'pretty', 'flat', 'even', 'attempt', 'making', 'three-dimensional', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'was', 'plenty', 'enough', 'root', '***', 'mini-spoilers', 'ahead', '***As', 'complaints', 'aliens', 'being', 'dumb', 'one', 'character', 'more', 'once', 'are', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'coming', 'America', ""'re"", 'Indians', 'So', 'think', 'When', 'Europeans', 'came', 'Americas', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'kill', 'everyone', 'came', 'native', 'people', 'were', 'nice', 'other', 'disease', 'left', 'alone', 'more', 'less', 'natives', 'were', 'aggressive', 'then', 'were', 'attacked', 'pay', 'attention', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'aliens', 'do', ""n't"", 'shoot', 'first', 'thought', 'aliens', 'were', 'making', 'attempt', 'peaceful', 'approach', 'fought', 'stay', 'alive', 'were', 'individuals', 'were', 'trigger', 'happy', 'others', 'were', 'possibly', 'pacifist', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'alien', 'invasion', 'plans', 'maybe', 'why', 'well', ""'ll"", 'see', '***', 'end', 'spoilers', '***Last', 'note', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'end', 'credits']",N/A

Lets not kid ourselves here i would say roughly every 10 years someone makes a movie about the Navy. Usually in reference to submarines or SEALs. This is the first modern naval war film i know of that doesn't focus on submarines. I'm not too sure why people don't like it. It has a hero, a villan, big guns, and cool effects. It should be well liked. I think the problem is people walk in expecting something that will be off the charts like Inception or something that makes you think a lot during the movie. While this movie will make you think (mainly on how they could possibly win). You wont be mentally thinking to the extent of Inception or some other generally thought provoking film. This film doesn't ask much of its viewers except to sit and watch. It will lay the ground work and walk you through every step.This is a Naval Warfare film so you cant really expect too many twists and turns and curve balls. I will certainly admit that it is not a film for everyone, if your someone who absolutely demands films to leave you awestruck and blown away then this is not a film that i would recommend to you. Because odds are you wouldn't appreciate the subtle awesome things of this film that a Veteran or a military buff would get. Such as when the USS Missouri power slides then fires off those massive 16.5 cannons.This film does show a rebel Naval Officer turning into the officer he is needed to be. This film shows you Naval Firepower at its finest and is the only film i know of that gives the ships this much screen time. You see ships in plenty of films (such as all 3 Transformers but never do they get this much screen time). Then again you would expect this from a film named Battleship. It will certainly appeal to veterans and anyone interested in the mean grey machines that rule the seas. Would certainly be best understood by any military personnel who understand the sacrifice portrayed when the ships go down. Its my opinion that unless you have written that blank check to your country that is payable up to your life then you'll never really understand that sacrifice portrayed.I'm telling you now if you expect a film that provokes deep thought within yourself then this isn't a film for you and I'd advise you continue your search. Because you won't find it here. This film is really good at making you think 1.HOLY CRAP THAT IS AWESOME! 2. I wonder what would really happen in that situation of aliens showing up. and maybe 3. would i be willing to take that risk if i were in their shoes?I found this film to be outstanding and was certainly glad that for once my friends in the Navy who serve on the ships got their due credit. I found this film to be so good i watched it and 30min later i watched it again.I cannot stress enough that people who demand films of the highest quality wont be impressed. However people who like to see heros overcome adversity and overwhelming odds to win the day will enjoy this film.In my opinion its a good film.",5,Finally a modern film that shows that saliors are heros too.,1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,3052,"['Frankly', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'idea', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'not', 'kid', 'here', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'roughly', '10', 'years', 'someone', 'movie', 'Navy', 'Usually', 'reference', 'submarines', 'SEALs', 'first', 'modern', 'naval', 'war', 'film', 'i', 'know', ""n't"", 'focus', 'submarines', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'why', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'hero', 'villan', 'big', 'guns', 'cool', 'effects', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'liked', 'think', 'problem', 'people', 'walk', 'expecting', 'something', 'will', 'be', 'off', 'charts', 'Inception', 'something', 'think', 'lot', 'movie', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'mainly', 'how', 'could', 'possibly', 'win', 'wont', 'be', 'mentally', 'thinking', 'extent', 'Inception', 'other', 'generally', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'ask', 'much', 'viewers', 'sit', 'watch', 'will', 'lay', 'ground', 'work', 'walk', 'step.This', 'Naval', 'Warfare', 'film', 'so', 'cant', 'really', 'expect', 'too', 'many', 'twists', 'turns', 'curve', 'balls', 'will', 'certainly', 'admit', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'someone', 'who', 'absolutely', 'films', 'leave', 'awestruck', 'blown', 'away', 'then', 'not', 'film', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'odds', 'are', 'would', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'awesome', 'things', 'film', 'Veteran', 'military', 'buff', 'would', 'get', 'Such', 'when', 'USS', 'Missouri', 'power', 'slides', 'then', 'massive', '16.5', 'cannons.This', 'film', 'show', 'rebel', 'Naval', 'Officer', 'turning', 'officer', 'needed', 'be', 'film', 'Naval', 'Firepower', 'finest', 'only', 'film', 'i', 'know', 'ships', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'see', 'ships', 'plenty', 'films', 'such', '3', 'Transformers', 'never', 'do', 'get', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'Then', 'again', 'would', 'expect', 'film', 'named', 'Battleship', 'will', 'certainly', 'appeal', 'veterans', 'anyone', 'interested', 'mean', 'grey', 'machines', 'rule', 'seas', 'Would', 'certainly', 'be', 'best', 'understood', 'military', 'personnel', 'who', 'understand', 'sacrifice', 'portrayed', 'when', 'ships', 'go', 'down', 'opinion', 'have', 'written', 'blank', 'check', 'country', 'payable', 'life', 'then', ""'ll"", 'never', 'really', 'understand', 'sacrifice', 'portrayed.I', ""'m"", 'telling', 'now', 'expect', 'film', 'deep', 'thought', 'then', ""n't"", 'film', ""'d"", 'advise', 'continue', 'search', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'making', 'think', '1.HOLY', 'CRAP', 'THAT', 'AWESOME', '2', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'really', 'happen', 'situation', 'aliens', 'showing', 'up', 'maybe', '3.', 'would', 'i', 'be', 'willing', 'take', 'risk', 'i', 'were', 'shoes', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'outstanding', 'was', 'certainly', 'glad', 'once', 'friends', 'Navy', 'who', 'serve', 'ships', 'got', 'due', 'credit', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'i', 'watched', '30min', 'later', 'i', 'watched', 'again.I', 'can', 'not', 'stress', 'enough', 'people', 'who', 'demand', 'films', 'highest', 'quality', 'wont', 'be', 'impressed', 'However', 'people', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'heros', 'overcome', 'adversity', 'overwhelming', 'odds', 'win', 'day', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film.In', 'opinion', 'good', 'film']",N/A

Then we are told that the spaceships are going toward some sort of astronomical radio station in the Hawaii.. and that should be because they lost their communication spaceship.. never mind the fact that they started targeting the station *before* that ship crashed...Then for some mysterious reason the alien ships after creating a huge energy shield to isolate the Hawaii do not attack and destroy the us and Japanese destroyers trapped in the energy field unless those ships fire on them first and happily ignore all the others...and these should be aliens keen on destroying the humans?? Actually if you follow the action with a minimum of attention you realize that it's actually the US navy who fires the first lethal weapon and starts the conflict.. I don't think the authors themselves realized this, probably used to the fact that after WW 2 if a war starts it's usually the US who started it..Anyhow , as if this wasn't demential enough, we are supposed to believe that an emitter ""five time more powerful than any before it""(wow!) who started communication in 2006 has made contact with aliens living on an earthlike planet just discovered by NASA..and caused them to show up on earth in just six years time... too bad that there are only 4 stars in a 6 light years radius..and the closest is more than 4 light years away..which leaves less the 2 years for the aliens to rush towards Earth faster than light to crash one of their ships (the most important one , of course..) on a puny satellite.. and of course these superadvanced aliens who can defy the most advanced physics we know have to wait for us to discover their planet..Come on! Who writes this stuff???  I suppose who wrote this stuff assumed that the average public watching this flick would not have the faintest culture about modern physics and astronomy.. but still!

1471728,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAIHPE,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","Battleship(released April/12)is another enterprise/film similar to Transformers(their property also)in look and feel.We have the great CGI effects and the grandiose musical score.The movie traveled along pretty well until about the 70 minute mark,then it seemed to lose its steam,failed to capture its initial excitement and coasted the rest of the way out.The film stars Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper,Liam Neeson as Admiral Terrance Shane,among others.The plot involves Kitsch as a smart but out of control 26 years old,with no solid direction in life and who lives with his brother,a commander in the Navy.After getting arrested his brother has had enough of his antics and enlists him in the Navy also.Fast forward and Kitsch is a lieutenant on board a destroyer.The back story to all this is that a group of scientists have found a planet outside our solar system that is much like earth and are sending signals to it via a sophisticated satellite array.Admiral Terrance puts his ship fleet on maneuvers along with several other countries,in the Pacific.While his ships are engaged in this,five alien objects enter earth's atmosphere with most flying into the ocean,while one crashes through the city of Hong Kong,creating much damage.While authorities are examining the wreckage of the Hong Kong crash and determining that it's metal is of unknown origin,things are happening in the waters near the fleet exercises.Kitsch has been put in charge of a destroyer and his crew examine some unusual objects sticking out of the water.While on top of one of the protrusions,Kitsch is zapped by an electrical current and thrown back.Suddenly the piece he was standing on raises out of the water and we see that it was a small part of a larger space craft,and they are not happy campers.Before you can say John Paul Jones the fight is on.The aliens have two very destructive weapons:first are hamburger shaped and wizzing dynamos which when they land destroy anything inanimate,and the second thing are smaller projectiles which impact a ships surface and almost immediately explode with usually fatal and horrific results(similar in shape to the pegs in the game Battleship).Both of these weapons are used to great success throughout the film,but at this point they almost completely disable and/or sink the fleet of ships in the area.They also throw up a round and enveloping bubble of energy,that is virtually impenetrable.This energy field essentially isolates a few of the fleet's ships while excluding the rest.It is a good way of protecting the alien's main contingent while also testing their battle skills against Earth's.Back in Hawaii where the space arrays were set up to contact the alien world,the aliens themselves have come to roost there.They need the array itself to send a message back to their home world,as it is believed the one that crashed into Hong Kong was its main communication device.Kitsch's girlfriend manages to contact Kitsch and tell him that the satellite that the dishes line up with,will be in sync in a short time and that he must destroy the arrays before they do.Out in the Pacific,what is left of the fleet is just one ship.Through the use of Tsunami buoys in the ocean(the idea of a Japanese commander),they calculate the positions of the alien ships.They eventually manage to destroy all three of the alien battle space ships but their last remaining battleship is destroyed;and they need to destroy the mother ship creating the large force field.They return to Pearl Harbour where Kitsch gets an idea to take out the old USS Missouri battleship,decommissioned since /92 and now a floating museum,and the only vessel within the energy bubble.With the help of some old vets,Kitsch gets his wish.They re-enter the fight and take down the remaining alien ship and the force field.Before the USS Missouri can be taken out by the aliens the fleet,previously on the outside looking in,now enters the fray and destroys the final ship along with the arrays.The film ends as everyone who survived is being awarded medals.The film is good until about the 70 minute mark.We had been intro'd to the main plot(attack of aliens and our reaction),and the side plot of the transmitting arrays;even the sub plot involving Kitsch and the admirals daughter.Up until that mark the film does a good job at integrating all plots and keeping the pace up.The film's pace slows considerably after the main battle is through and the filmmakers seem to want to concentrate too much on Kitschs's girlfriend and her involvement with the arrays,an amputee serviceman and one of the array techies.Of course it is germane to the story but after the wild battle ride we had just experienced,the rather slow pace and less exciting events on the ground seem a world away from what is happening out in the water;where the action really is.The film tries to get the dynamic up again,as events in the water start to build inexorably,but they never do reach the intensity of what had come initially.And besides this,whatever events do happen on the ground,they all originate from the battle out at sea.As an aside,I was wondering what Hasbro is doing these days with their properties,such as Transformers and this one,besides trying to make more money from them? Those games and toys were first discovered by kids way back when,and it is kids generally who still play with them.But these movies are not geared for kids,as they're way too intense.More like they're geared for the kids that have grown up and first discovered them when they first came out.Although I can see parents these days either still getting their kids into seeing these films and/or letting them watch the movie either when they rent or buy it on DVD;NOT recommended by me at any time.Finally this film is a tribute to armed forces veterans everywhere.They are present(real vets)in both official ceremonies in the beginning and at the end of the film.Also appearing is Gregory D. Gadson as Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales.He is seen here as the double amputee and the man Kitsch's girlfriend is assigned to.Gadson is a well known and decorated war hero in real life and it was a really nice touch adding such a person to the acting roster.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.All in all a movie with a good potential,which they fulfill until about the 70 minute mark,then it all starts to unravel.This is an effects driven picture,in sound and look and should have been better than it was.Hasbro's Transformers got it the first time and fizzled out the second time.Maybe since they fizzled out the first time here,they will get it the second time around.3 1/2 stars.",3,"Comes on great guns,goes

1471757,ALS7KUA5EQE61,B005LAIHPE,SciFi Man,"[2, 5]","I like intelligent science fiction films, but every now and then I get a craving for a mindless action flick.  Battleship delivers the sci-fi and action components (emphasis on the action) but leaves out much of the intelligence.  That's OK because that's what I expected, and I enjoyed it for what it is.The story (such as it is) is simple:  An alien flotilla arrives on Earth and hides in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.  A U.S. naval fleet is conducting exercises in the neighborhood.  Mayhem ensues.The CGI effects are fantastic, and they bring to life some intense combat scenes.  If you liked Transformers, you'll like Battleship.  There's a fair amount of humor as well, especially toward the beginning.  The scene where Taylor Kitsch's character goes to extreme lengths to get a burrito for a girl is actually based almost frame for frame on actual surveillance footage of a comical burglary of a convenience store which occurred several years ago.  This movie could be a 2 hour long recruiting video for the Navy.  Fighting ships and all forms of naval hardware are showcased left and right.Before the movie was released, a lot of people made quips about how elements of the original board game would be incorporated into the film.  Well... that's exactly what they did!  The main defensive weapon on the alien ships hurls explosive shells that are shaped like the plastic pegs used in the game.  There's a scene during a night battle where naval officers are breathlessly staring at a computer-generated grid while a captain gives out targeting coordinates for missle strikes.There is a long list of things in this film that just made no sense.  For example, the aliens in the film are a paradox.  They have ships that can travel across light years in no time and can generate impenetrable energy shields.  On the other hand, their ships' main defensive weapons are no more effective than conventional artillery.

However, what Berg delivered with Battleship was a hokey, corny, unrealistic dud. I almost walked out of my own home theater.On the other hand, fledgling Directors Mike McCoy & Scott Waugh come up with the unique concept of casting a group of real Navy SEALs in a story about fighting terrorists, and they deliver a powerful, realistic, emotional thrill ride of a military film.So if we break out some of the important elements of both films, let's see how they fare against each other:Battleship Story: 1 star - A cool Sci-fi/military concept turned into silliness by goofball, slow-moving side stories and disastrous attempts at humor.Act of Valor Story: 5 stars - A serious, action packed military film based on true events of the heroism of US soldiers that have to rescue an abducted op and take out a terrorist.Battleship Acting Talent: 2 stars - Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), Alexander Skarsgrd (True Blood) and Rihanna (Really? Rihanna???) corn up the screen with unbelievable portrayals of men and women who fight for our country.Act of Valor Acting Talent: 5 stars - U.S. Navy SEALs and U.S. Navy Special Warfare Combatant Crewmen show audiences their stripes and make you think that your watching real life Black Ops events captured on camera.Battleship Action: 3 stars - When the actors aren't hamming up the screen, the action is not bad, but unfortunately there's way too much hamming up the screen.Act of Valor Action: 5 stars - Even the short amount of time at the beginning of the movie that is spent introducing you to the heroes that will star in the film moves along due to the underlying tone of something big about to happen. Then when the real action starts, it's intense.Battleship FX: 3 stars - Okay, Battleship's FX weren't bad, but even the main alien craft had a hokeyness to it as it looked like some kind of Transformer-bot instead of a lean, mean, alien fighting machine.Act of Valor FX: 4 stars - Act of Valor is not an FX movie, but the use of current battlefield technology is awesome to observe in action.Average stars for Battleship: 2.25Average stars for Act of Valor: 4.75Hands down: If you've not had the opportunity to see either of these movies and you're here looking for something to order on Instant Video (or put into you DVD player), stay away from Battleship and add Act of Valor to your cart/queue.",2,No Acts of Valor in Battleship,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",2012,2927,"['perusing', 'Instant', 'Video', 'PS3', 'weekend', 'saw', 'two', 'movies', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'cool', 'So', 'Friday', 'night', 'did', 'Battleship', 'Saturday', 'didAct', 'Valor', 'what', 'difference', 'one', 'get', 'suckered', 'stupidness', 'other', 'get', 'captivated', 'awesomeness.Director', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'recently', 'did', 'excellent', 'superhero', 'movie', 'Will', 'Smith', 'calledHancock', 'when', 'saw', 'Berg', 'would', 'be', 'helm', 'Hasbro', 'Battleship', 'based', 'trailers', 'thought', ""'d"", 'get', 'cool', 'military', 'movie', 'focused', 'Navy', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'alien', 'invasion', 'However', 'what', 'Berg', 'delivered', 'Battleship', 'was', 'hokey', 'corny', 'unrealistic', 'dud', 'almost', 'walked', 'own', 'home', 'other', 'hand', 'fledgling', 'Directors', 'Mike', 'McCoy', 'Scott', 'Waugh', 'come', 'up', 'unique', 'concept', 'casting', 'group', 'real', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'story', 'fighting', 'terrorists', 'deliver', 'powerful', 'realistic', 'emotional', 'thrill', 'ride', 'military', 'film.So', 'break', 'out', 'important', 'elements', 'films', 'let', 'see', 'how', 'fare', 'other', 'Battleship', 'Story', '1', 'star', 'cool', 'Sci-fi/military', 'concept', 'turned', 'silliness', 'goofball', 'slow-moving', 'side', 'stories', 'disastrous', 'attempts', 'humor.Act', 'Valor', 'Story', '5', 'stars', 'serious', 'action', 'packed', 'military', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'events', 'heroism', 'US', 'soldiers', 'have', 'rescue', 'abducted', 'op', 'take', 'out', 'terrorist.Battleship', 'Acting', 'Talent', '2', 'stars', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'John', 'Carter', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'True', 'Blood', 'Rihanna', 'Really', 'Rihanna', 'corn', 'screen', 'unbelievable', 'portrayals', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'fight', 'country.Act', 'Valor', 'Acting', 'Talent', '5', 'stars', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'SEALs', 'U.S.', 'Navy', 'Special', 'Warfare', 'Combatant', 'Crewmen', 'show', 'stripes', 'make', 'think', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'Black', 'Ops', 'events', 'captured', 'camera.Battleship', 'Action', '3', 'stars', 'When', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'hamming', 'up', 'screen', 'action', 'not', 'bad', 'unfortunately', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'hamming', 'up', 'screen.Act', 'Valor', 'Action', '5', 'stars', 'Even', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'beginning', 'movie', 'spent', 'introducing', 'heroes', 'will', 'star', 'film', 'moves', 'along', 'due', 'underlying', 'tone', 'something', 'big', 'happen', 'Then', 'when', 'real', 'action', 'intense.Battleship', 'FX', '3', 'stars', 'Okay', 'Battleship', 'FX', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'main', 'alien', 'craft', 'had', 'hokeyness', 'looked', 'kind', 'Transformer-bot', 'instead', 'lean', 'mean', 'alien', 'fighting', 'machine.Act', 'Valor', 'FX', '4', 'stars', 'Act', 'Valor', 'not', 'FX', 'movie', 'use', 'current', 'battlefield', 'technology', 'awesome', 'observe', 'action.Average', 'stars', 'Battleship', '2.25Average', 'stars', 'Act', 'Valor', '4.75Hands', ""'ve"", 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'movies', ""'re"", 'here', 'looking', 'something', 'order', 'Instant', 'Video', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'stay', 'away', 'Battleship', 'add', 'Act', 'Valor', 'cart/queue']",N/A

The aliens say ""Sounds fun"".  So the aliens leap in their uber-fast, technologically awesome starships that can successfully cross the vast voids of space to find a tiny planet but which, alas, are incapable of avoiding satellites or even landing safely. Go figure. Maybe the alien engineers put all their efforts into the propulsion units and forgot about the brakes and steering. Luckily for Earth only one alien starship had a communications module that could phone home and that was the one that hit the satellite.  So the aliens must use Hawaii's radio telescopes (or whatever) for that purpose. Hawaii is then surrounded by an alien force field and the aliens send in some traffic control bots to manage the crowded local highways. Luckily three navy destroyers are inside the forcefield and one of these has a senior officer who is an arrogant screw-up with the common sense of a deranged chicken burrito thief. Watch out aliens!To be honest, the premise of this film excited me and even the synopsis sounded fun. The graphics were certainly magnificient. Alas this film just felt like someone in the scriptwriting department had said ""Hey, why don't we remake both 'Top Gun' and 'War of the Worlds' in one big movie, use ships instead of planes, replace Tom Cruise with his clone, and then include some real ex-military personnel."" Actually, I'm glad they did include some ex-military personnel, especially the double amputee, because their acting I actually enjoyed. (NOTE: a big thumbs up to Gregory Gadson whom it is difficult not to admire).I give the film three stars because I did actually enjoy several parts of it, but the screenwriting just really was appalling.

1471799,A17M1HL6U2GS7M,B005LAIHPE,Storylover,"[0, 0]","Taylor Kitsch was in two huge tentpole movies this summer--John Carter and Battleship. For a number of reasons, John Carter did relatively poorly at the box-office in relation to its cost.  It was, however, a really enjoyable film.  Battleship kinda tanked at the box office also, and so I thought that maybe I'd give it a try also--perhaps two Taylor Kitsch starring blockbusters would be similarly fun.  Well, John Carter started with a killer source--a classic of sci-fi pulp by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Battleship started with a Hasbro game.  It is a fun game, mind you, but not much of a plot.  The movie makers completely embraced the concept of the game for this film--all the things that make Battleship a really fun game are here.  Two naval powers (one alien in this case) locked in a battle where neither can see the other and both need to bomb the heck out of the other.  That makes a great game, but kind of a thin plot as produced here.  The script tried to inject a little human drama in: the main character and his brother have a nice relationship, but it doesn't grow much.  Alexander Skaarsgard does a great job as the responsible older brother, but it would have been nice to see their relatinoship mature somewhat.  There is a very pleasant romance with an extremely beautiful woman who likes chicken burritos, a fact which fuels the best scene in the entire movie.  Sadly, that scene happens in the first 10 minutes.  Rihanna is another bright spot--true, she wasn't required to do much, but she had lots of screen time and she did a great job.  The special effects are, of course, excellent in quality.  Unfortunately, they are lacking in originality.  There is nothing wrong with the space ships--they look cool, but they look and behave like transformers.  The spinning ball saws are also very cool, but also look like transformers.  The aliens themselves are a little laughable, but get points for their creepy hands.  There are so many plot holes and contrivances that it gets a little wearisome in the middle, but in spite of it all, the movie comes to a satisfactory close as a popcorn movie should.  My pre-teen boys all thought it was great; I enjoyed it inspite of everything but will likely not need to see it again.  I probably should have waited for this to come out on HBO or something instead of buying the blu-ray, but i bet my kids will watch it enough to justify the purchase.  And if you haven't seen John Carter---give it a try.  It's much better popcorn fun.",3,Pleasant summer shoot-em-up with aliens and burritos.

It's Transformers with Destroyers and Battleships against space aliens. And as such, it is very, very good.""You Sank My Battleship!""Yes indeed, this is a movie based on a board game (can Monopoly and Risk be far behind?) It's directed with plenty of film style that would make Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay squeal with delight. Everything is done to be the perfect typical summer blockbuster with loads of gunfire, explosions, plucky but not-too-bright heroes and plenty of CGI eye-candy.Sun Tzu and the Art of ExplosionsWhat separates this movie from the other films of its type is the QUALITY of the film. Believe it or not, you can have GOOD cheesy dialog, and you can have BAD cheesy dialog. You can have GOOD CGI aliens, and BAD CGI aliens. This movie does it great all around.When my sister told me about how great this film was I didn't want to believe it. A good movie based on a board game? No way! But she's never led me astray before...and as the film progressed, I realized why she liked it so much...and why my dad said he liked it better than Transformers.Fire!For starters, Taylor Kitsch is GREAT in the main role of the plucky, rebellious, goofy, and awesome loser who becomes the Earth's best hope. I loved him in John Carter, and I love him here. He has great comic timing, he's fun to watch, and he's LIKABLE. I tried not to laugh when he went on a quest for a chicken burrito impress a pretty girl...and as the scene progressed, and built and built...by the end I could NOT stop laughing. Brilliant comic timing that, and good direction. I knew then I was going to enjoy this movie.Likewise, his arch-rival turned ally does a fantastic job, again with great timing and likability. I think most people groaned when they heard Rihanna would be in this film, but she's definitely no Ice Cube from Anaconda. Likewise Liam Neeson does a great job with his character, and all of the smaller side characters are pretty good as well. The only real downside in that department is the love interest. She's no Estella Warren, but she's just...a stereotype, and has no depth whatsoever (and in this movie that's saying something).As for the story, there isn't really one (but you knew that). What dialog there is, is mostly summer blockbuster dialog, but it's smarter and better done in general than usual. The same goes for action sequences, special effects, music, and overall style of story-telling. When I was actually enthralled by the climax of the film I knew they had done things right.Is this a movie I'd pay full-price to see? No. Would I buy the Blu Ray or DVD full-price? No. But do I want to buy a cheap copy of this movie on Blu Ray or DVD and watch it a gazillion times for guilty-pleasure entertainment?

I understand why many producers are withholding their films from critics until they are in theaters because they can just massacre a film to the point where no one will go and see it. I critique every film I watch with just one question- ""Was it entertaining?""  In the case of Battleship- YES it was entertaining!  It doesn't have an intricate plot, just a beginning, middle and end. It doesn't have award winning dialogue. No huge list of A-list actors. But these factors do not have to be in place to create a fun flick. The CGI was awesome, the actors did their jobs, I didn't have to stay on my toes for the next plot twist, and with Peter Berg directing you will not be let down if all you want is a couple hours to sit back, relax and watch a great popcorn action flick.  Just reading the title alone will tell you what kind of film you will be watching. And I don't get the whole ""based on the board game"" thing. From what has been said, it was one of the reasons it did not do well at the box office.  I don't even remember a reference to the game, nobody said ""You sunk my battleship!"" or anything like that! These types of ""rotten"" rated films will always be a part of my Blu-Ray collection and Battleship is no exception. Every movie is worth at least one look!

He sees a young lady at the bar attempting to score a chicken burrito...which leads us to some comical events and then the opening credits.After the credits, the film jumps some undisclosed years ahead. Alex is a full lieutenant in the navy on a ship (normally takes 8-10 years to rise that high). The girl, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) happens to be the daughter of the Fleet Admiral (Liam Neeson). They want to get married. The admiral loathes Alex because he is a gross underachiever. Everything is fun and games until...the subplots come together. At this point we can write the rest of the script. The alien ships were akin to transformers.I must apologize, but I enjoyed the film. The inane plot continuity issues and science was Asylum grade from beginning to end. I could be here all day writing about how absurd things were.

The premise of the US Navy saving the world from alien invasion is borderline stupid it's so ridiculous.  So it had better be fun.Was it fun seeing Liam Neeson play an admiral? Sure.  There was enough story there to make that fun.  I enjoy watching him act in movies even those with ridiculous premises.  I'll say the same for Alexander Skarsgrd.  I enjoy watching him act, even if he's a goofy SWO instead of a Viking Vampire.  The movie gets one star for casting them and the rest of the actors were competent as well.  The girl was cute, the Japanese guy was amusing. Etc...I give it another star for the spectacle. Cool special effects applied to the pleasurable task of dramatizing an old battleship blasting the crap out of an alien spacecraft.

Battleship surprised me because it showed more of the relationship between the brothers and the naval officers and their men than merely having things being blown up with wholesale destruction involved.  There's plenty of battle scenes with destruction for the explosion buff however, and the brief glimpses of the aliens is intriguing to say the least. The idea of a Japanese ship and an American ship off the coast of the Hawaii Islands cut off from the rest of the fleet because of a force-field dome and having to duke it out using a decommissioned battleship and a crew of WWII veterans was a neat twist. (The ship is analog-run and none of the youngsters know how to handle a non-computerized ship so the oldtimers have to help the young whippersnappers.) The characters are cliches, of course, but all so perfectly portrayed one can forgive that, from the young scientist at the very beginning who compares the sending out of a spacecraft to communicate with whatever's out there as &#34;Columbus and the Indians with us as the Indians,&#34; to the stern naval officer who's father of the titular heroine.  A few surprises along the way: the hero is a smart-ass loser who doesn't know what to do when he's suddenly placed in authority and gives command to the Japanese captain instead of forging ahead in his rebellious way to save the day himself. My only complaint: If only they'd left &#34;THE END&#34; before the credits instead of tacking on that opening ending afterward.

1471836,AMF52GSX309V0,B005LAIHPE,Tony S.,"[0, 0]","Battleship, the movie?  Sounds terrible right?  A movie based on a board game where the objective was basically to guess coordinates.  Well, Peter Berg didn't see it that way.  From the minute he signed on as director, he was begging audiences to give his film a chance.  When the studio saw that American's were already 'knockin' it before tryin' it', they decided to release the movie overseas a month before the United States.  The outcome?  Well, let's go.What I liked about the film:The StoryThe STORY, not the script.  The story is quite simple really.  Aliens have crash landed on earth to take over satellite communication with their home planet.  By creating a force field around a small fleet of Navy ships, the aliens have forced the fight on water.  The script is being shredded by critics, and for good reason.  But the story was simple enough to justify the existence of the aliens on our planet, and in turn &#34;justifying&#34; the action.Taylor KitschTaylor Kitsch's character is a hot headed young man who's joined the Navy after his older brother (played by Alexander Skarsgard), refuses to financially support him any longer.  Skarsgard's character is a captain in the Navy and is the man in charge once the navy begins their war on the aliens.  What's important to note is, Kitsch's character actually does experience a growth, a nice arc.  He may not be the best actor doing these genre films, but he is getting better with every performance.The Action/Special EffectsIt's not an easy feat to create a war over water.  As an audience, we've come to expect the best of the best.  The movie creates action set pieces that have never been seen before.  Another complaint I'm reading online is, the movie completely disregards physics... really?!  What did you expect?  This is a movie about aliens invading Earth for satellite communication!  Come on people.  Writers Eric and Jon Hoeber wrote a simple, action packed script with some bad cliches.  But Berg choreographed some great action that made even the most mundane objectives exciting.  I especially liked the way the filmmaker incorporated the simple strategy of the board game into the film, without throwing it right in our faces.  Those hating on this aspect of the film need to get over it.What I didn't like about the film:The CharactersBeyond Kitsch's character, there is not much more to be proud of for the writers.  The great Liam Neeson is restricted to a few scenes from a chair.  Brooklyn Decker plays his daughter, and Kitsch's love interest... for no reason.  She literally serves no purpose to the film, other than eye candy.  Then there is singer/actress Rihanna.  She is a pleasure to look at, but again, has nothing to do in the film that a nameless character couldn't have done for her.  The trailer sold her as the daughter of a Navy veteran who predicted the alien attacks.  But the script does nothing to further explore that one line of dialogue.The ClichesSpeaking of the dialogue.  The writers must have tried their best to put in every action film cliche into the script.  There is the &#34;Mahalo Mother F-----&#34;, BOOM, SHOT TO THE FACE.  There is the slow motion walk used in countless action films.  Only in this film, it's a set of 1940's Navy veterans asked to be a part of the final action sequence.  No seriously, I didn't make that up.  I wonder if the studio asks writers to put these things in their scripts?  Does anyone know?  I'd be curious to find out.  Nonetheless, a silly script with silly dialogue of course.The Verdict:Berg &#62; BayThe above equation says it all for me.  I'll take a Peter Berg movie over a Michael Bay film any day of the week.  The similarities between Battleship and Transformers can not be ignored.  Berg however has a way of making the action more meaningful, placing more importance on the heroics of our main characters.  The movie is not great, by any means.  But by no means is it as bad as I thought it would be.  In fact, I rather enjoyed the mind numbing action.  There are a ton of 'money shots' to get hypnotized by.  I believe it is going to flop in theaters, and maybe this is the film to finally get through Hollywood's thick skull.  More original material (Inception), less tie-ins (Transformers).  Either way, take a date to this movie and enjoy the eye candy for two hours.",3,Battleship review; not nearly as bad as some are saying,1356220800,"12 23, 2012",2012,4336,"['Battleship', 'movie', 'terrible', 'right', 'A', 'movie', 'based', 'board', 'game', 'where', 'objective', 'was', 'basically', 'guess', 'coordinates', 'Well', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'way', 'minute', 'signed', 'director', 'was', 'begging', 'audiences', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'When', 'studio', 'saw', 'American', 'were', 'already', ""'knockin"", 'tryin', 'decided', 'release', 'movie', 'overseas', 'month', 'United', 'States', 'outcome', 'Well', 'let', 'go.What', 'liked', 'film', 'StoryThe', 'STORY', 'not', 'script', 'story', 'quite', 'simple', 'really', 'Aliens', 'have', 'crash', 'landed', 'earth', 'take', 'over', 'satellite', 'communication', 'home', 'planet', 'creating', 'force', 'field', 'small', 'fleet', 'Navy', 'ships', 'aliens', 'have', 'forced', 'fight', 'water', 'script', 'being', 'shredded', 'critics', 'good', 'reason', 'story', 'was', 'simple', 'enough', 'justify', 'existence', 'aliens', 'planet', 'turn', '34', 'justifying', '34', 'action.Taylor', 'KitschTaylor', 'Kitsch', 'character', 'hot', 'headed', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'joined', 'Navy', 'older', 'brother', 'played', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'financially', 'support', 'longer', 'Skarsgard', 'character', 'captain', 'Navy', 'man', 'charge', 'navy', 'war', 'aliens', 'What', 'important', 'note', 'Kitsch', 'character', 'actually', 'experience', 'growth', 'nice', 'arc', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'actor', 'doing', 'genre', 'films', 'getting', 'better', 'performance.The', 'Action/Special', 'EffectsIt', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'create', 'war', 'water', 'audience', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'best', 'best', 'movie', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'before', 'complaint', ""'m"", 'reading', 'online', 'movie', 'completely', 'disregards', 'physics', 'really', 'What', 'did', 'expect', 'movie', 'aliens', 'invading', 'Earth', 'satellite', 'communication', 'Come', 'people', 'Writers', 'Eric', 'Jon', 'Hoeber', 'wrote', 'simple', 'action', 'packed', 'script', 'bad', 'cliches', 'Berg', 'choreographed', 'great', 'action', 'made', 'even', 'most', 'mundane', 'objectives', 'exciting', 'especially', 'liked', 'way', 'filmmaker', 'incorporated', 'simple', 'strategy', 'board', 'game', 'film', 'throwing', 'right', 'hating', 'aspect', 'film', 'need', 'get', 'it.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'CharactersBeyond', 'Kitsch', 'character', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'proud', 'writers', 'great', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'restricted', 'few', 'scenes', 'chair', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'daughter', 'Kitsch', 'love', 'interest', 'reason', 'literally', 'purpose', 'film', 'other', 'eye', 'candy', 'Then', 'singer/actress', 'Rihanna', 'pleasure', 'look', 'again', 'nothing', 'do', 'film', 'nameless', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'trailer', 'sold', 'daughter', 'Navy', 'veteran', 'who', 'predicted', 'alien', 'attacks', 'script', 'nothing', 'further', 'explore', 'one', 'line', 'dialogue.The', 'ClichesSpeaking', 'dialogue', 'writers', 'must', 'have', 'tried', 'best', 'put', 'action', 'film', 'cliche', 'script', '34', 'Mahalo', 'Mother', 'F', '34', 'BOOM', 'SHOT', 'TO', 'THE', 'FACE', 'slow', 'motion', 'walk', 'used', 'countless', 'action', 'films', 'Only', 'film', 'set', '1940', 'Navy', 'veterans', 'asked', 'be', 'part', 'final', 'action', 'sequence', 'seriously', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'wonder', 'studio', 'writers', 'put', 'things', 'scripts', 'Does', 'anyone', 'know', ""'d"", 'be', 'curious', 'find', 'out', 'Nonetheless', 'silly', 'script', 'silly', 'dialogue', 'course.The', 'Verdict', 'Berg', '62', 'BayThe', 'equation', ""'ll"", 'take', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'film', 'day', 'week', 'similarities', 'Battleship', 'Transformers', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'Berg', 'however', 'way', 'making', 'action', 'more', 'meaningful', 'placing', 'more', 'importance', 'heroics', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'not', 'great', 'means', 'means', 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fact', 'rather', 'enjoyed', 'mind', 'numbing', 'action', 'are', 'ton', ""'money"", 'shots', 'get', 'hypnotized', 'believe', 'going', 'flop', 'theaters', 'maybe', 'film', 'finally', 'get', 'Hollywood', 'thick', 'skull', 'More', 'original', 'material', 'Inception', 'less', 'tie-ins', 'Transformers', 'way', 'take', 'date', 'movie', 'enjoy', 'eye', 'candy', 'two', 'hours']",N/A

Your opponent being aliens. Do you panic? Do you surrender? Do you pay more than ten dollars to see it?In 2005, NASA has discovered a planet outside our solar system with conditions similar to those on Earth. Hoping that it contains intelligent life, they construct a powerful array of satellite dishes in Hawaii to transmit a signal to that planet. Simultaneously, unambitious Hawaiian native Alex Hopper (played by John Carter from John Carter Taylor Kitsch) meets a beautiful woman in a bar he wants to impress. The woman (played by Brooklyn Decker) wants a burrito but the bartender won't accommodate her. Hopper (Kitsch) hears this, introduces himself, and goes so far out of his way to impress her that he breaks into a minimart and is tasered by the police just as he's approaching the beautiful woman, burrito in hand. Alex's older brother Stone (played by Alexander Skarsgard) has had it with his brother's antics and makes him join the Navy. Seven years later, Alex is a lieutenant and tactical officer on a destroyer and the beautiful woman, Samantha, (Decker) has accepted his marriage proposal, pending her father's approval. Her father (played by Liam Neeson), an admiral whose character isn't given a first name, is Alex's superior who has disciplined him on several occasions and has grown just as frustrated with him as Hopper's brother has. Then, during an international exercise with the Japanese Navy, the world and the island come under attack by the very same aliens they hoped to contact.Now, this isn't the first movie ever to be based on a board game. Clue came out in 1985 and had a much better cast. Also, Clue is a game with characters in it. Battleship, on the other hand has none. It also doesn't have aliens. While there is an actual battleship late in the film, the alien munitions resemble pegs, and the crew is forced to fire blind once they've lost radar, this movie has nothing to do with the game. Other detractors seem determined to lay the movies failures at Rihanna's feet, this being her first acting role, but she really doesn't have that many lines and the failures in Battleship are so much bigger than this one minor character. Whether Transformers turned out the way Michael Bay and Spielberg wanted it to, it was a box office smash.

Very loosely based on a Hasbro's game, Universal Picture's ""Battleship"" is exactly what you expect from Hollywood's action-packed sci-fi blockbuster film: impressive special effects and incredible storyline.Four mysterious objects from outer space crash land off the coast of Hawaii during a RIMPAC, a multinational maritime exercise. Completely isolated from the rest of the RIMPAC fleet, Lieutenant Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch, ""John Carter""), still inexperienced, finds himself in charge of the ship, which may determine the fate of the entire human race.The film opens rather slowly, with a silly episode about our hero Alex, who in his attempt to impress a woman named Samantha (Brooklyn Decker), breaks into a convenience store to get chicken burrito (shot in YouTube fashion). Alexander Skarsgrd plays his elder brother Stone Hopper, who forces Alex (arrested, but successful in impressing her) to join the US Navy.Directed by Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"" ""The Kingdom"" ""Hancock""), the film takes some time to introduce the main characters including Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano), Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) and a weapon expert Cora Raikes (Rihanna). It takes some time for the film to pick up its pace, and once it does, it delivers the goods with fast-paced action set-pieces created with visual effects, even though the underwritten story never convinces.",4,Pure Hollywood Blockbuster Entertainment,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1486,"['Imagine', 'Independence', 'Day', 'naval', 'combat', 'will', 'get', 'rough', 'idea', 'what', 'will', 'see', 'Battleship', 'Very', 'loosely', 'based', 'Hasbro', 'game', 'Universal', 'Picture', 'Battleship', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'action-packed', 'sci-fi', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'impressive', 'special', 'effects', 'incredible', 'storyline.Four', 'mysterious', 'objects', 'outer', 'space', 'crash', 'land', 'coast', 'Hawaii', 'RIMPAC', 'multinational', 'maritime', 'exercise', 'Completely', 'isolated', 'rest', 'RIMPAC', 'fleet', 'Lieutenant', 'Alex', 'Hopper', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'John', 'Carter', 'still', 'inexperienced', 'charge', 'ship', 'may', 'determine', 'fate', 'entire', 'human', 'race.The', 'film', 'rather', 'slowly', 'silly', 'episode', 'hero', 'Alex', 'who', 'attempt', 'impress', 'woman', 'named', 'Samantha', 'Brooklyn', 'Decker', 'convenience', 'store', 'get', 'chicken', 'burrito', 'shot', 'YouTube', 'fashion', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgrd', 'elder', 'brother', 'Stone', 'Hopper', 'who', 'Alex', 'arrested', 'successful', 'impressing', 'join', 'US', 'Navy.Directed', 'Peter', 'Berg', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'Kingdom', 'Hancock', 'film', 'time', 'introduce', 'main', 'characters', 'including', 'Captain', 'Nagata', 'Tadanobu', 'Asano', 'Admiral', 'Shane', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'weapon', 'expert', 'Cora', 'Raikes', 'Rihanna', 'time', 'film', 'pick', 'up', 'pace', 'once', 'goods', 'fast-paced', 'action', 'set-pieces', 'created', 'visual', 'effects', 'even', 'underwritten', 'story', 'never', 'convinces']",N/A

The aliens target 3 of the destroyers behind a major force field and manage to sink two of them, one of them a Japanese navy vessel. The surviving destroyer, the USS JOHN PAUL JONES manages to pick up the survivors, with only a Navy lieutenant at the helm named Hopper who apparently is on the last legs of his career, but is forced into command when the top-ranking officers of the JONES are dead.While watching this movie, I was thinking, ""How is ONE destroyer going to fend off this alien force when the other two ships were destroyed without making much of a dent against the attacking aliens and when their alien scouts can't seem to be brought down by gunfire?"" I mean, seriously, one of the crew had to actually kill one alien by blowing it off the deck at point-blank range with one of the guns of the destroyer. When the destroyer is eventually ""sunk"" off the coast of Hawaii(more like destroyed into bits), the survivors, including Hopper, man the decks of the nearby USS MISSOURI, an old WW2 battleship that hadn't run in over a decade, and only with the help of WW2 vets can they pull this one off for a final showdown against the alien menace.Action-packed in every scene!

It's loud, obnoxious, stupid, preposterous. Based on the board game (never a good premise) of opposing navies doing battle with each other, the film brings aliens into the mix against an international armada. The film starts out with the only decent moment in it- a bungled break-in at a closed convenience store for the sake of a burrito, committed by a screwup and captured for laughs on surveillance cameras. From there, the film goes downhill fast. Flash forward a few years, and the screwup is an officer in the navy. Alien invaders arrive on earth in an advance force of a handful of ships, one of which comes apart and kills a few thousand people crashing in Hong Kong. The rest set up station around Hawaii during a naval exercise, surrounding the islands with an energy shield, trapping most of the ships outside. Circumstance leads to one of the battleships inside the barrier under command of the senior surviving officer, the previously mentioned wash out screwup about to be court martialed for disciplinary problems. Officer Screwup (also known as Taylor Kitsch) somehow manages to get himself into the right command mindset and takes on the aliens, whose ships spend as much time on the water surface as they occasionally- and clumsily- do flying. The alien tech is awkward, shifting and reshaping as the story calls for it, and the aliens themselves are less than impressive. The cast should know better than to have gotten in on this. Neeson and Skarsgard have the presence to be plausible naval officers, and Kitsch plays the screwup reasonably well, though his sudden reversion to thinking like a commander is implausible. These actors are all capable of better, and they do themselves a disservice by appearing in this disaster. Rihanna, whose music I don't personally like, should stick to music. Her acting is abysmal and painfully wooden. Director Peter Berg is capable of so much better than this- this is the guy who directed The Kingdom, after all. By the last act of the film, featuring veterans of the USS Missouri (I hope these guys are just actors, because if they're the real thing, they have not only disgraced themselves, they've disgraced the ship and their crewmates), the film has become so exceedingly stupid that the end result is that you've gone and wasted two hours of your life.

Talk about stupidity.The reason Battleship was not a success is the terrible trailers. Next time anyone is putting out a quality movie, let some of the story out. The trailers portrayed the women as wimps when they were powerful additions to the story. Let it out that a beautiful woman has a mind. The critics say it had predictable lines, they were soo wrong, but again they liked the stupid utterly no redeeming attributes of Prometheus. Can you tell I felt like I lost my money on Prometheus?
