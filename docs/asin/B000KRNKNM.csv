1035560,ACQTEHY8775IB,B000KRNKNM,fit girl,"[9, 10]","I was surprised and pleased that my heartrate stayed elevated throughout the routine, which, for 45 minutes, is very effective in providing a total body workout.  I often find that circuit training under an hour leaves out a couple of muscle groups, but I felt that I got all the good stuff here!  I was especially grateful to the fact that Jeanette includes inner and outer thigh work, instead of just lunges and squats, along with thorough upper body training.  Jeanette's workouts are straightforward with no complicated choreography, so I can recommend this workout to anyone.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I would have liked it to be just a bit longer, with a little more cardio.",4,Effective and Efficient,1201478400,"01 28, 2008",2008,707,"['was', 'surprised', 'pleased', 'heartrate', 'stayed', 'elevated', 'routine', '45', 'minutes', 'very', 'effective', 'providing', 'total', 'body', 'workout', 'often', 'find', 'circuit', 'training', 'hour', 'out', 'couple', 'muscle', 'groups', 'felt', 'got', 'good', 'stuff', 'here', 'was', 'especially', 'grateful', 'fact', 'Jeanette', 'inner', 'outer', 'thigh', 'work', 'instead', 'just', 'lunges', 'squats', 'thorough', 'upper', 'body', 'training', 'Jeanette', 'workouts', 'are', 'straightforward', 'complicated', 'choreography', 'can', 'recommend', 'workout', 'anyone', 'only', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'just', 'bit', 'longer', 'little', 'more', 'cardio']",Hollywood Trainer / Cario Sculpt

1035562,A1LHXVJYN4HU0F,B000KRNKNM,"Monilyn ""book lover and mom""","[2, 2]",Cardio Scuplt by Jeanette Jenkins is a good workout. She is very upbeat and the workout will definitely have you sweating! She targets both upper and lower body through fast moving exercises (at times using weights). I definitely recommend this DVD!,4,Nice workout,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2008,249,"['Cardio', 'Scuplt', 'Jeanette', 'Jenkins', 'good', 'workout', 'very', 'upbeat', 'workout', 'will', 'definitely', 'have', 'sweating', 'upper', 'lower', 'body', 'fast', 'moving', 'exercises', 'times', 'using', 'weights', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'DVD']",Hollywood Trainer / Cario Sculpt

I've only used it twice since I got it, but it worked my legs and arms pretty well- the back of my thighs are sore the next day.  There is a lot of focus on arms in this video- I would have preferred a bit more cardio, but it's still good.Update: I've had this workout about 10 months now, and it's become one of my faves.  It's a really good workout, and it moves along very fast, so you don't get bored.  it's also not so hard you want to quit.  Love it!

1035564,A1KMDI5N5ZT85T,B000KRNKNM,Mylo's Mom,"[3, 3]","Jeanette has a positive, no-nonsense approach to her workout.  If you want a break for water, you've got to pause the DVD (and that's NOT a complaint!!).  She uses every second of that 45 minutes to work your body, head-to-toe.  If you don't want to feel some burn everywhere, try a different workout.  She cuts out any ""fluff"" whatsoever and just keeps to business.  At some points, I thought she came across a little-less-than-friendly and considered marking down one star for that.  But then I remembered:  She's made this workout to be challenging and to actually change the shape of your body.  If you follow along with her routine, there's no way to avoid getting in better shape!!  I purchased this on Amazon for less than $10.00 (shipping was free), and I felt as though it paid for itself in the first workout.",5,No nonsense that kicks your butt!!!,1203724800,"02 23, 2008",2008,819,"['Jeanette', 'positive', 'no-nonsense', 'approach', 'workout', 'want', 'break', 'water', ""'ve"", 'got', 'pause', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'complaint', 'second', '45', 'minutes', 'work', 'body', 'head-to-toe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'feel', 'burn', 'everywhere', 'try', 'different', 'workout', 'out', 'fluff', 'whatsoever', 'just', 'keeps', 'business', 'points', 'thought', 'came', 'little-less-than-friendly', 'considered', 'marking', 'down', 'one', 'star', 'then', 'remembered', 'made', 'workout', 'be', 'challenging', 'actually', 'change', 'shape', 'body', 'follow', 'along', 'routine', 'way', 'avoid', 'getting', 'better', 'shape', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'less', '10.00', 'shipping', 'was', 'free', 'felt', 'paid', 'first', 'workout']",Hollywood Trainer / Cario Sculpt

She works the arms, legs, abs, back,and glutes.  She keeps your heartrate up too.  The workout starts off with a warm up, then she switches between cardio, arms, and lower body. She even has some kickboxing at the end.  Then she goes to the floor and works your glutes really good then does some abs and then ends it with a nice stretch.  I can see this workout being very effective and easy to keep up with.",4,Great Workout!!!,1203033600,"02 15, 2008",2008,497,"['love', 'workout', 'can', 'get', 'cardio', 'strength', 'training', '45', 'minutes', 'arms', 'legs', 'abs', 'back', 'glutes', 'heartrate', 'up', 'too', 'workout', 'warm', 'up', 'then', 'cardio', 'arms', 'lower', 'body', 'even', 'kickboxing', 'end', 'Then', 'floor', 'glutes', 'really', 'good', 'then', 'abs', 'then', 'nice', 'stretch', 'can', 'see', 'workout', 'being', 'very', 'effective', 'easy', 'keep', 'up']",Hollywood Trainer / Cario Sculpt
