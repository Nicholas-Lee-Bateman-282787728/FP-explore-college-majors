However, that being said, I have been EXTREMELY impressed with it.The warm-up really gets me feeling loose and focused, and Bob is a very good instructor.  He's very calm and encouraging (which, if you watch The Biggest Loser, you know is not always the case!).Level 1 is pretty good, although it's fairly repetitive.  As a complete yoga novice, I felt the burn right away in my legs and arms from holding the poses for so long.  It does get really tiring after a while, but you feel (or at least I felt) so much more energized after.I haven't done Levels 2 and 3 yet - still working up to those!The cool down feels oh-so-good on the aching muscles - you're never pushed too far, but you feel stretched after finishing.  I like to do this dvd right before bed, because it helps me calm down after long days.The BEST thing about this dvd is the actual format of the dvd itself - I love how you can literally ""build your own"" workout.  It's so helpful to not be skipping through chapters, which is such a horrible distraction from a workout.All in all, I love this dvd.

Holding the poses are difficult when you want them to be, but you will end up being sweaty and tired at the end without burning as much calories as you would like.

I've wasted a lot money on workout videos that ended up being huge disappointments). I don't watch the Biggest Loser very often, but I have seen a few episodes, so I was somewhat familiar with Bob. This DVD is very good and I was surprised at how challenging it was. I am not a fitness fanatic, but I do work out on the treadmill regularly, and I also do some strength training in between. I tried one of Jillian's videos (again, checked it out from the library--they mailed it to me for free!) and I absolutely hated it. I found her to be crass and, frankly, her behavior was just weird--like she was stoned or something. Anyway, I found Bob to be nothing like that! He was pleasant, clear in his instructions, and supportive without being sappy, bullying or obnoxious. I worked up quite a sweat, and my core was sore the next day. I couldn't believe that the other people in the video could hold those poses for so long-- longer than I could, and I viewed myself as being in better shape than most of them (that'll show me!). In fact, I found their ability to out-perform me to be inspirational as well as humbling. It was also a good reminder that fitness goes beyond cardio and weights. I highly recommend this one.

Each position is held for enough time that you really feel your patience and your endurance being tested. You will recognize postures like warrior I and warrior II, plank, downward dog and others. They may look easy at first but your arms will start to tire and your legs will begin to shake. At least if you are at an intermediate level. Because of the time you hold the poses I think this workout is more advanced. If you do the entire workout you will warmup then do 45 minutes of yoga (three sections) and then cool down with some relaxing stretches that are easy to do. The only things you need for this workout are a yoga mat, 3-5 pound weights and a six-pound medicine ball. If you are a beginner you could skip using the ball and weights. Modifications are given for most of the difficult exercises and some of the exercisers demonstrate the easier versions for the entire time. Bob Harper is an excellent trainer and I felt like I was getting individual attention. His cuing is so precise it is a pleasure to exercise with confidence.

As you may be able to deduce, I am the kind of person who really dislikes traditional workout programs like aerobics and boring weight-training routines.  Therefore, I've done the 10 Minute Solutions Pilates video series for my strength training needs for a very long time (highly recommend those as well), but have gotten a bit bored with them and was looking for something new.This video was exactly what I was looking for.  I am a slender person in my early 30s who, while admittedly have been fairly inactive for the past few months, is in decent shape.  But even for someone like me, the Yoga Level 1 routine had me shaking within minutes.  My butt and thighs were on fire!  IMO, holding yoga poses is so much more effective (and low-impact) than squats and lunges.  I could really feel deep into the fiber of my muscles while doing warrior I & II, whereas with squats and lunges, I just feel it more in my knees.  Bob is a great fitness instructor and is motivational without being annoying or cheesy.  He also keeps the workout moving - giving you no time to rest - which is the key to an effective weight-loss workout.  I wasn't sure I could go on to Level 2 since I was shaking so much from Level 1, but tried it anyway.  It is a combination of pilates & yoga ab work, which I have been doing for years, so it was all familiar to me - yet still challenging, and I could definitely feel it my core.  I am sure that if used 3-4 times a week, this video will be a very effective way to firm up in no time.One last word to the reviews where people say this is not yoga.  Yes, it is.  In Level 1, he's using all traditional yoga poses.  What about this is not yoga?  Yes, Levels 2 & 3 are more focused on a hybrid of pilates & weight lifting, but so what?  The title of this video is ""Weight Loss Yoga"", not ""Classical Yoga"".  The title itself is obviously implies a different take on it, as does the fact it is featuring a trainer from the Biggest Loser.  It's helping people lose weight and firm up by using some basic fundamental poses of yoga.  If you want something that is straight, classic yoga, buy a DVD that actually proffers that.

That said, the workout integrates many common yoga poses (the Warrior series, plank, down and up dog, triangle) in a way that uses your own body weight to build strength. You hold the poses longer as opposed to flowing between many poses. The final segment uses hand weights while holding and flowing in between poses. The great thing about this DVD is that it tests your mental agility, something that traditional yoga encourages, and your endurance will be utilized, too. Overall, it's a decent workout. It's very challenging.

Make sure you watch it all the way through at least once before you try it.Bob makes you feel motivated, that the poses are do-able - maybe you can't do that well today, but keep plugging away at it. Whatever you can do today is perfect.I am no fan of BL, I've seen it maybe 4 times. I do wish Bob would do another DVD because his cheerful encouragement really comes across in this DVD and it's the one I always come back to. I even like the ""big drama"" music which annoyed me at first. I have the next DVD with Jillian Michaels on pre order and I am hoping that it's better then I think it will be.

1198392,A3MFB2Z14O2ORN,B001GP5TLI,"Space Monkey ""exercise junkie""","[15, 18]","I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees).  I bought this DVD in a store for [..], and can't believe how good it is.  I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain.  My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility.  I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again.This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose.  He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits.  He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover.  He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time.  Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be.  I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time.Overall, this was a great yoga workout.  Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!Of course, it helps that I love Bob.  =D",5,Left me feeling quite zen.,1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,1725,"['recently', 'have', 'been', 'training', 'hard', 'almost', 'overtraining', 'had', 'head', 'few', 'weeks', 'active', 'recovery', 'still', 'wanted', 'workout', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'hard', 'knees', 'bought', 'DVD', 'store', '[', '..', ']', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'having', 'serious', 'pain', 'right', 'knee', 'doing', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'more', 'knee', 'pain', 'muscles', 'feel', 'lengthened', 'have', 'recovered', 'quite', 'nicely', 'have', 'greatly', 'improved', 'flexibility', 'love', 'workout', 'so', 'much', 'am', 'going', 'add', 'once', 'week', 'when', 'start', 'strength', 'training/plyometrics', 'training', 'again.This', 'workout', 'joke', 'however', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'looking', 'low', 'impact', 'still', 'making', 'sweat', 'mentally', 'begging', 'Bob', 'say', 'were', 'done', 'holding', 'pose', 'pilates', 'standard', 'yoga', 'liked', 'still', 'pushes', 'limits', 'tend', 'make', 'hold', 'plank', 'lot', 'was', 'fine', 'having', 'let', 'lower', 'rather', 'upper', 'body', 'recover', 'was', ""n't"", 'annoying', 'yoga', 'instructors', 'can', 'be', 'was', 'encouraging', 'yet', 'demanding', 'same', 'time', 'reviewers', 'have', 'made', 'comments', 'music', 'should', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'music', 'are', 'focusing', 'moves', 'should', 'be', 'LOVE', 'ability', 'customize', 'workout', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'who', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'have', 'limited', 'amounts', 'time.Overall', 'was', 'great', 'yoga', 'workout', 'Having', 'done', 'yoga', 'part', 'P90X', 'program', 'solid', 'workout', 'not', '90', 'minutes', 'long', 'P90X', 'yoga', 'DVD', 'was', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'workout', 'anyone', 'wanting', 'improve', 'flexibility', 'strength', 'anyone', 'who', 'recovery', 'course', 'love', 'Bob', '=D']",Biggest Loser: Weight Loss Yoga

It allows you to build your workout based on how much time you have and what type of workout you're in the mood for.
