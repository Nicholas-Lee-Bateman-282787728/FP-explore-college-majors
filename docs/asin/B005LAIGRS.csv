At one point, after an admittedly awesome action scene lasting several minutes, they escape in a car, only to have their car taken out (no more that 20 seconds later), forcing them to run...cue action, again.

1465328,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B005LAIGRS,C. Sawin,"[27, 41]","Safe House has Denzel Washington return to the role everyone loves him for; that untouchable, bad ass, man of the hour kind of role that he's essentially played the majority of his career. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds sets out to try to prove he's capable of being more than a raunchy goofball. CIA agent Matt Weston (Reynolds) has anxiously been waiting to prove himself. He's been babysitting an empty safe house for twelve months and is eager to get out in the field. Matt gets his chance when Tobin Frost (Washington), ex-CIA agent, traitor to the organization, and currently one of the CIA's most wanted fugitives, is escorted there. But things are turned upside down when a group of unknown soldiers attack the safe house and take out the entire team who accompanied Frost. Now in over his head, Matt tries to cope with handling the situation on his own while Frost does his best to manipulate the rookie.You'll probably notice the visual style of Safe House right away. It makes full use of that raw, gritty style. It's especially grainy at times as fluorescent lighting seems to jump off the screen. Judging by how the movie looks alone, you'd think Tony Scott directed it. But it's actually the English language debut of Swedish director Daniel Espinosa. So it just seems as though he patterned Safe House after Tony Scott's films. It doesn't take long for negotiations to get tense. Those moments in between the mayhem are when Safe House is at its best. It's like a game of tug of war between Frost's way of manipulating and Matt's attempt to stick to protocol while also juggling a relationship. Those moments of panic are explosive; especially the one at the safe house Matt was in charge of and the intense car chase immediately afterwards. Safe House has a way of getting really LOUD when you're totally expecting it. It usually involves a gunshot or six, but it's kind of the movie's way of telling you that some heavy stuff is about to go down.The majority of the movie is basically Matt trying to prove himself as an agent all while absolutely everything that you could imagine to go wrong does. Safe House is actually pretty damn good for nearly half of the movie. Sure, Denzel is playing a character you've seen him play a few dozen times before but he does it so well and the audience obviously eats it up. So why wouldn't you give the paying viewer what they want to see? Ryan Reynolds makes the most of his performance though. He seems to be the most emotionally invested actor of the film meaning he shows the most emotion and has the most range. The movie kind of gets coiled up in itself with everything it has going for it in the last twenty minutes or so. It's like it couldn't handle the pressure of being a fairly strong action thriller or something. It becomes extremely excessive and it throws a ton of twists at you in this small amount of time. It's difficult to care about any of them when all of the characters feel so similar and you can pretty much see them coming a mile away. The movie follows this certain path that you may be expecting, but then it shifts direction before shifting again and shifting back again. Did you ever see the movie Basic with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson? Safe House was reminiscent of the amount of twists in Basic.Safe House begins as this white knuckled thriller with a fairly strong screenplay from first time screenwriter David Guggenheim. The action is heavy, the story reels you in, and the performances of both Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds are pretty superb. Everything eventually falls apart though as Safe House falls victim to stereotypical mediocrity. Brutal and intriguing at times and completely frustrating at others, Safe House is mostly exactly what you're expecting and the type of action thriller you've seen done several times before.  It's basically a safe bet for success.",3,"Somewhat satisfactory, but mediocre thriller overall",1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,3871,"['Safe', 'House', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'return', 'role', 'everyone', 'untouchable', 'bad', 'ass', 'man', 'hour', 'kind', 'role', 'essentially', 'played', 'majority', 'career', 'Meanwhile', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'out', 'try', 'prove', 'capable', 'being', 'more', 'raunchy', 'goofball', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Reynolds', 'anxiously', 'been', 'waiting', 'prove', 'been', 'babysitting', 'empty', 'safe', 'house', 'twelve', 'months', 'eager', 'get', 'out', 'field', 'Matt', 'chance', 'when', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'Washington', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'traitor', 'organization', 'currently', 'one', 'CIA', 'most', 'wanted', 'fugitives', 'escorted', 'there', 'things', 'are', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'group', 'unknown', 'soldiers', 'attack', 'safe', 'house', 'take', 'out', 'entire', 'team', 'who', 'accompanied', 'Frost', 'Now', 'head', 'Matt', 'cope', 'handling', 'situation', 'own', 'while', 'Frost', 'best', 'manipulate', 'rookie.You', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'notice', 'visual', 'style', 'Safe', 'House', 'right', 'away', 'full', 'use', 'raw', 'gritty', 'style', 'especially', 'grainy', 'times', 'fluorescent', 'lighting', 'jump', 'off', 'screen', 'Judging', 'how', 'movie', 'alone', ""'d"", 'think', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'directed', 'actually', 'English', 'language', 'debut', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'just', 'patterned', 'Safe', 'House', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'films', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'negotiations', 'get', 'tense', 'moments', 'mayhem', 'are', 'when', 'Safe', 'House', 'best', 'game', 'tug', 'war', 'Frost', 'way', 'manipulating', 'Matt', 'attempt', 'stick', 'protocol', 'also', 'juggling', 'relationship', 'moments', 'panic', 'are', 'explosive', 'especially', 'one', 'safe', 'house', 'Matt', 'was', 'charge', 'intense', 'car', 'chase', 'immediately', 'afterwards', 'Safe', 'House', 'way', 'getting', 'really', 'LOUD', 'when', ""'re"", 'totally', 'expecting', 'usually', 'gunshot', 'six', 'kind', 'movie', 'way', 'telling', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'go', 'down.The', 'majority', 'movie', 'basically', 'Matt', 'trying', 'prove', 'agent', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'could', 'imagine', 'go', 'wrong', 'Safe', 'House', 'actually', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'nearly', 'half', 'movie', 'Sure', 'Denzel', 'playing', 'character', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'few', 'dozen', 'times', 'before', 'so', 'well', 'audience', 'obviously', 'up', 'So', 'why', 'would', ""n't"", 'give', 'paying', 'viewer', 'what', 'want', 'see', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'most', 'performance', 'be', 'most', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'actor', 'film', 'meaning', 'most', 'emotion', 'most', 'range', 'movie', 'kind', 'coiled', 'up', 'everything', 'going', 'last', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'could', ""n't"", 'handle', 'pressure', 'being', 'fairly', 'strong', 'action', 'thriller', 'something', 'extremely', 'excessive', 'ton', 'twists', 'small', 'amount', 'time', 'difficult', 'care', 'when', 'characters', 'feel', 'so', 'similar', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'movie', 'certain', 'path', 'may', 'be', 'expecting', 'then', 'direction', 'shifting', 'again', 'shifting', 'back', 'again', 'Did', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'Basic', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'Safe', 'House', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'amount', 'twists', 'Basic.Safe', 'House', 'white', 'knuckled', 'thriller', 'fairly', 'strong', 'screenplay', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Guggenheim', 'action', 'heavy', 'story', 'reels', 'performances', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'are', 'pretty', 'superb', 'Everything', 'eventually', 'apart', 'Safe', 'House', 'victim', 'stereotypical', 'mediocrity', 'Brutal', 'intriguing', 'times', 'completely', 'frustrating', 'others', 'Safe', 'House', 'mostly', 'exactly', 'what', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'type', 'action', 'thriller', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'done', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'basically', 'safe', 'bet', 'success']",N/A

But, the story is the standard plot of corruption in an USA secret government department.  Bad persons, employees of the US government, are trying to kill the heroes with a lot of collateral damage.  In this movie it is the CIA government spy agency which results in innocent good hearted employee being used and almost murdered by corrupt CIA persons trying to keep secret bad things that the New York Times and Hollywood types think is bad and ""no-nos.""  What comes to the peoples rescue but the press.  What would we do without all the leaks the New York Times prints?  The USA and allies secret and spy organizations try to catch and find someone like the master mind behind the mass murder of Americans.  Are we not fortunate to have these leaks to the press even though it makes it more difficult for American secret government organizations to keep Americans safe?  An example harm done to those who help the US government keep Americans safe but are exposed by the Press is the Afghanistan doctor who helped the USA track down this mass murder, bin Ladden.  This doctor is now in an Afghanistan prison for 30 years.  This plot line of corrupt secret American government is so typical for American made movies.  The hero is working for the supposedly ""good guys"" secret government department meant to keep us safe from mass murderers who want to kill us in the name of Allah.

It offers lots of action, mayhem, and betrayal, served up with action sequences shot in grainy, jumpy footage moving at breathtaking speed.Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a bored young CIA officer, minding a safehouse in Capetown, romancing a local girl, and begging his boss for more action.  Action arrives unexpectedly at the safe house in the form of a CIA team transporting renegade CIA agent Tobin Frost (Washington).  More action arrives unannounced in the form of a well-armed mercenary team seeking Frost.  Weston goes on the run with Frost in tenuous custody.The narrative heart of the movie is the slowly developing relationship between the inexperienced Weston and master manipulator Frost.  As it becomes obvious there is another traitor in the mix, Weston and Frost will be forced to trust one another.  The action culminates in a desparate fight at a remote South African farmhouse.

Centered around the CIA and intelligence community, it has lots of fast action with hand-held cameras and frequent cuts within each scene.  I'd say it's a fairly well directed movie with good cinematography.Where it falls short, in my opinion, is the characters - and particularly the main character.  The main character is a youngish agent who is proprietor of a safe house.  He's bored; and he wants to prove himself.  He has a girlfriend - and he tells her that he's in some benign profession (he doesn't want her to know he's CIA).Denzel Washington plays a renegade (former) agent carrying some high-stakes intel.The main character (the youngish agent, who's name escapes me) remains undeveloped throughout the movie.  And as a consequence, I had no reason to care about him.  Denzel Washington's character was marginally developed; and I barely cared about him.  The young agent's girlfriend communicated her feelings fairly well (although she had hardly any part to play in the movie); and by the end of the movie, I cared about her.Despite the fast action and constant threats against the two main characters, I found the movie generally boring.

And it's well-filmed, gritty, grounded, realistic action. You will be sucked in and reluctant to blink, as you follow the events that unfold in the film's first third. Whoever directed this movie clearly studied a lot of Tony Scott pictures while he was in film school- his influence is stamped all over ""Safe House"", which is by no means a bad thing.Here we get a great glimpse of ""Bad Denzel"", the one who shows up in the likes of ""Training Day"" and ""Book of Eli"". He is incredibly confident, capable, and intimidating, without ever coming off as being unduly cocky or melodramatic. He is one of the great actors  working today, and his charisma is hard to ignore. Ryan Reynolds holds his own as he tackles the formidable task of trying to perform opposite Denzel. The young Reynolds does a great job here, and you don't even think of him as ""Van Wilder"" during the movie... not too much, anyway! And love the small role that Robert Patrick performs, as a grizzled, hard boiled combat vet.Unfortunately, things start to slow down about halfway through the movie (though there are still a couple of great action sequences sprinkled throughout), and then the story goes completely off the rails. If you've seen just about ANY unambitious government/spy/action movie over the past 25 years, you will see the ""surprise"" ending coming ten miles away. It's such a tired cliche, I don't even think you could call it a ""surprise"" by any means. I guess I was just ""surprised"" that a movie with such high production values wouldn't spend a little more time on the development of the plot.

It is a film that is packed with fine actors who've proved their chops many times, but here writer David Guggenheim has simply failed to give them a plausible, sensible story and all that is left after movie's end is confusion and a lot of smoke, fire, and debris and scratching of the head. Daniel Espinosa directs obtusely.Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a bored but in love CIA rookie whose tedious assignment it is to man a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa: he longs for a European assignment but his position on the CIA totem pole is far too low for anything other than where he is, according to his boss Dave Barlow (Brendan Gleason). Things change rather abruptly when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) the CIA's most wanted rogue agent is captured and taken to the safe house. The CIA suddenly sees Matt's position as key and his bosses (Vera Farmiga, Sam Shepard et al) see that they finally have caught the dangerous rouge CIA Tobin Frost. In interrogation ensues but during Frost's interrogation, the safe house is overtaken by mercenaries who want Frost. Weston and Frost escape and must stay out of the gunmen's sight until they can get to another safe house. From there on it is chase scenes segueing into chase scenes and very little makes sense to the point that few in the audience will care what happens.Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington are always a delight to watch and even with this little bit of a mess of a movie they still make it watchable. The rest of the big name actors - Farmiga, Gleason, Shepard, Rub&eacute;n Blades, Robert Patrick, Liam Cunningham and Nora Arnezeder - are barely given enough lines to exist. But if you like action flicks, this one will likely please. Just keep expectations low. Grady Harp, June 12",3,"`People don't want the truth anymore, Matt. It's too messy.

1465388,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B005LAIGRS,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[0, 0]","Denzel Washington: One of our greatest living actors. Ryan Reynolds: One of our most charismatic young leading men. A supporting cast of Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Shepard. The subject of SAFE HOUSE: A young CIA case officer (Reynolds) and an extremely experienced former CIA agent-turned-traitor (Washington) are the latest in a series of mismatched, ""unlikely alliance"" partnership as they flee from a squad of hired killers. As they go along, the young agent is gradually feeling the influence of the older, hardened ""I know how things really work"" former agent. Does that last part sound familiar? Good, because it should, especially when it comes to Denzel.The film opens with Reynolds proving how physical and buff he is by a few rounds with a punching bag, and a shower with his ridiculously sexy French girlfriend. Reynolds plays Matt Weston, a case officer for the CIA who's sole responsibility is being the ""housekeeper"" of a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He comes in, checks the supplies, turns everything on and waits for something to happen, as he's apparently done for the previous twelve months, but nothing ever does. On the other side of the city, Tobin Frost (Washington) gets something from a contact, kills a man trying to kill him in a bathroom, gets shot at, crashes cars and runs to the US Embassy in Cape Town. His arrival prompts everyone back at Langley to go ape. Apparently Frost turned rogue nine years previously and he's been selling secrets to different countries during all that time, and is an expert at psych profiling and turning assets. So Shepard, playing a high-up muckity-muck directs this operation to get him moved to Weston's safe house, as lower echelon operators Gleeson and Farmiga quibble about how best to approach Frost. Of course once Frost gets to the safe house (and is waterboarded for good measure), several armed hostiles break in and impossibly kill all the trained men responsible for guarding Frost, but Weston gets Frost out, and they begin committing mayhem all around Cape Town with car chases, shoot outs, epic fisticuffs, more car chases and more shoot outs, while Frost does his best to get under Weston's skin and shake his conviction and the mystery of the information Frost has reveals some bad people amongst Weston's CIA handlers. Who is it? Is it Farmiga? Gleeson? Shepard?The things that I will give this film is that it definitely has momentum, and there is some interesting chemistry between Washington and Reynolds. I say ""interesting"" because it's obvious that Reynolds, as charismatic as he is, is no match for Washington, but that's actually part of the point of this film, just in the way that Weston is no match for Frost, mentally or physically. The only thing that Weston still has is his belief, but no matter what because of how predictable the film plays itself out, you know that he's going to lose that belief by the end. The film does really move from one heart-stopping scene to another, though, and really that's the only thing that keeps this film decent.From a performance standpoint, Washington is certainly not at the tip-top of his game, but he does deliver a strong performance here as someone who has obviously seen and done far too much. Reynolds plays the naive-yet-preternaturally-talented agent pretty well, considering they could have played more to his strengths as the cocky, rebellious type if they had decided to go down that road. The saddest thing here is the waste of supporting talent. Extremely talented character actors like Farmiga, Gleeson and Shepard are all stripped of the ability to play real characters and instead play cliches, and that's a shame. The villains of the piece are just there to shoot, fight and look menacing. Even strong but lesser-known actors like Joel Kinnaman (THE KILLING, the upcoming reboot of ROBOCOP) and Liam Cunningham (GAME OF THRONES and about every other British or Irish role out there) are given NOTHING to do here.Director Daniel Espinosa, doing his first major Hollywood film here, throws a lot at us during the runtime of the film, consistently building momentum, but doesn't do anything particularly fresh here. His style seems to be a kind of mash-up of Tony Scott and Paul Greengrass, and they've done far better films than this.Really when all is said and done, going to the SAFE HOUSE is a road we've taken many times in the past and some of those roads are a LOT better, but at least here, there are some interesting things to see during the journey.",3,"TRAINING DAY 2: This time, it's spies!",1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,4530,"['Denzel', 'Washington', 'One', 'greatest', 'living', 'actors', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'One', 'most', 'charismatic', 'young', 'leading', 'men', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'subject', 'SAFE', 'HOUSE', 'young', 'CIA', 'case', 'officer', 'Reynolds', 'extremely', 'experienced', 'former', 'CIA', 'agent-turned-traitor', 'Washington', 'are', 'latest', 'series', 'mismatched', 'unlikely', 'alliance', 'partnership', 'flee', 'squad', 'hired', 'killers', 'go', 'along', 'young', 'agent', 'gradually', 'feeling', 'influence', 'older', 'hardened', 'know', 'how', 'things', 'really', 'work', 'former', 'agent', 'last', 'part', 'sound', 'familiar', 'Good', 'should', 'especially', 'when', 'Denzel.The', 'film', 'Reynolds', 'proving', 'how', 'physical', 'buff', 'few', 'rounds', 'punching', 'bag', 'shower', 'ridiculously', 'sexy', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'Reynolds', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'case', 'officer', 'CIA', 'who', 'sole', 'responsibility', 'being', 'housekeeper', 'safe', 'house', 'Cape', 'Town', 'South', 'Africa', 'supplies', 'everything', 'waits', 'something', 'happen', 'apparently', 'done', 'previous', 'twelve', 'months', 'nothing', 'ever', 'other', 'side', 'city', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'Washington', 'something', 'contact', 'man', 'trying', 'kill', 'bathroom', 'shot', 'crashes', 'cars', 'US', 'Embassy', 'Cape', 'Town', 'arrival', 'prompts', 'everyone', 'back', 'Langley', 'go', 'ape', 'Apparently', 'Frost', 'turned', 'rogue', 'nine', 'years', 'previously', 'been', 'selling', 'secrets', 'different', 'countries', 'time', 'expert', 'psych', 'profiling', 'turning', 'assets', 'So', 'Shepard', 'playing', 'high-up', 'muckity-muck', 'directs', 'operation', 'get', 'moved', 'Weston', 'safe', 'house', 'lower', 'echelon', 'operators', 'Gleeson', 'Farmiga', 'quibble', 'how', 'best', 'approach', 'Frost', 'course', 'once', 'Frost', 'safe', 'house', 'waterboarded', 'good', 'measure', 'several', 'armed', 'hostiles', 'break', 'impossibly', 'kill', 'trained', 'men', 'responsible', 'guarding', 'Frost', 'Weston', 'Frost', 'begin', 'committing', 'mayhem', 'Cape', 'Town', 'car', 'chases', 'shoot', 'outs', 'epic', 'fisticuffs', 'more', 'car', 'chases', 'more', 'shoot', 'outs', 'Frost', 'best', 'get', 'Weston', 'skin', 'shake', 'conviction', 'mystery', 'information', 'Frost', 'reveals', 'bad', 'people', 'amongst', 'Weston', 'CIA', 'handlers', 'Who', 'Farmiga', 'Gleeson', 'Shepard', 'things', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'definitely', 'momentum', 'interesting', 'chemistry', 'Washington', 'Reynolds', 'say', 'interesting', 'obvious', 'Reynolds', 'as', 'charismatic', 'match', 'Washington', 'actually', 'part', 'point', 'film', 'just', 'way', 'Weston', 'match', 'Frost', 'mentally', 'physically', 'only', 'thing', 'Weston', 'still', 'belief', 'matter', 'what', 'how', 'predictable', 'film', 'out', 'know', 'going', 'lose', 'belief', 'end', 'film', 'really', 'move', 'one', 'heart-stopping', 'scene', 'though', 'really', 'only', 'thing', 'film', 'performance', 'standpoint', 'Washington', 'certainly', 'not', 'tip-top', 'game', 'deliver', 'strong', 'performance', 'here', 'someone', 'who', 'obviously', 'seen', 'done', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'Reynolds', 'naive-yet-preternaturally-talented', 'agent', 'pretty', 'well', 'considering', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'more', 'strengths', 'cocky', 'rebellious', 'type', 'had', 'decided', 'go', 'down', 'road', 'saddest', 'thing', 'here', 'waste', 'supporting', 'talent', 'Extremely', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'Farmiga', 'Gleeson', 'Shepard', 'are', 'stripped', 'ability', 'play', 'real', 'characters', 'instead', 'play', 'cliches', 'shame', 'villains', 'piece', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'shoot', 'fight', 'look', 'menacing', 'Even', 'strong', 'lesser-known', 'actors', 'Joel', 'Kinnaman', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'upcoming', 'reboot', 'ROBOCOP', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'other', 'British', 'Irish', 'role', 'there', 'are', 'given', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'here.Director', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'doing', 'first', 'major', 'Hollywood', 'film', 'here', 'lot', 'runtime', 'film', 'consistently', 'building', 'momentum', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'particularly', 'fresh', 'here', 'style', 'be', 'kind', 'mash-up', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Paul', 'Greengrass', ""'ve"", 'done', 'far', 'better', 'films', 'this.Really', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'going', 'SAFE', 'HOUSE', 'road', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'many', 'times', 'past', 'roads', 'are', 'LOT', 'better', 'least', 'here', 'are', 'interesting', 'things', 'see', 'journey']",N/A

1465392,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B005LAIGRS,Jason,"[0, 0]","CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) discretely guards a safe-house in South Africa that has less activity than a morgue.  His average shift at work involves tossing a ball against a wall roughly 8043 times, becoming a Sudoku master, some alone time on the porcelain throne, and more Angry Birds than you care to imagine.  Everything changes when Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue agent forced to either turn himself in to the US Consulate or die at the hands of criminals, enters the fold.  Frost's presence creates an opportunity for Weston to prove himself, but Frost may be too much to handle physically and/or psychologically.Aside from the fact that the pair must go on the run and endure car chases during the shoot-outs and battles with enemies, the film felt like it could have easily been a sequel to Assault on Precinct 13 or The Contract.  (Oddly enough, each of those films has a younger white actor guarding/protecting an older black actor, and in each case the older actor is the superior in most conceivable ways.  I digress.)Much like his relationship with Denzel in terms of acting, Ryan Reynolds is initially over his head.

1465410,A3SJ0QX9QO69BZ,B005LAIGRS,"John R. Pluntze, Jr. ""pluntze2001""","[0, 0]","I would be extremely surprised if Swedish-born director Daniel Espinosa (he made 2010's superb thriller, ""Easy Money"" -- among others) hasn't watched and re-watched and then re-watched again the justly-celebrated films of writer-director Michael Mann (particularly ""Thief"", ""Manhunter"", ""Miami Vice"", ""Public Enemies"" and, most notably, ""Heat"") because this terrific, no-holes-barred 2012 thriller definitely calls to mind those seriously kick-ass awesome Mann movies -- ones that are, at once, both incredibly beautiful (i.e., the cinematography and the camerawork), but also rather ugly as well at times (i.e., the emotional and physical violence in them) -- as well as a number of similarly-terrific 1970s-era ""paranoid"" thrillers (such as ""Parallax View"", ""Black Sunday"", ""Marathon Man"", ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"", ""The Wilby Conspiracy"", and perhaps most pointedly, ""Three Days Of the Condor"").(It also happily tips its hat more than once to Stanley Kramer's 1959 classic, ""The Defiant Ones"").Much like 1973's CIA-oriented ""Three Days Of the Condor"", Espinosa's South African-set drama involves a dupe who doesn't KNOW that he's a dupe -- Redford in ""Condor""; an Oscar-worthy Ryan Reynolds here in ""Safe House"") -- and who eventually finds a verrrry unlikely ally (Faye Dunaway in ""Condor""; Denzel Washington in ""Safe House""), two men working for a government agency that both of them once trusted, but who no longer do (and probably very wisely so, as it turns out).However, what makes ""Safe House"" REALLY stand out from ""Condor"", particularly, are the dazzling/jaw-dropping action sequences that deft screenwriter David Guggenheim and director Espinsosa intersperse throughout this relentless and extremely tense, two-hour drama. There's a superbly-staged car chase in Cape Town, a rooftop foot chase in a Johannesburg shanty town, and a number of hand-to-hand fighting sequences that are among the most believable (and, by extension, among the most gruesome) of any I've seen anytime recently in a mainstream Hollywood release ... all of which may at least partly explain why ""Safe House"" was such a huge, unqualified hit, not only in the U.S., but in the rest of the world as well (dazzling action set pieces tend to quite easily transcend language barriers).But ""Safe House"" is also, at times, surprisingly MOVING as well -- which I think is another reason why this very smart and well-executed drama stayed with me longggg after I first it in a theater this past winter. There's a very palpable and powerful emotional gravity that runs throughout this movie, one that you almost never find in a big-budget Hollywood movie with this many dazzling action sequences in it (Michael Bay could definitely learn A LOT from Espinosa!!)Ultimately, ""Safe House"" is a movie about the truly destructive nature of lies -- what they do to those of us who tell them ... and also what they do to those of us who are on the receiving end of them. Government officials around the globe would do well to heed this film's cautionary tale.Sumptuous cinematography by Oliver Wood (""Die Hard 2"", ""Face/Off"", the three ""Bourne"" movies), with a haunting and spare score by Ramin Djawadi.",5,Cast and Crew REALLY Bring the 'Heat' In South African-Set 'Safe House'/A+++++,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,3174,"['would', 'be', 'extremely', 'surprised', 'Swedish-born', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'made', '2010', 'superb', 'thriller', 'Easy', 'Money', 'others', ""n't"", 'watched', 're-watched', 'then', 're-watched', 'again', 'justly-celebrated', 'films', 'writer-director', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'particularly', 'Thief', 'Manhunter', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Public', 'Enemies', 'most', 'notably', 'Heat', 'terrific', 'no-holes-barred', '2012', 'thriller', 'definitely', 'mind', 'seriously', 'kick-ass', 'awesome', 'Mann', 'movies', 'ones', 'are', 'once', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'i.e.', 'cinematography', 'camerawork', 'also', 'rather', 'ugly', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'i.e.', 'emotional', 'physical', 'violence', 'as', 'well', 'number', 'similarly-terrific', '1970s-era', 'paranoid', 'thrillers', 'such', 'Parallax', 'View', 'Black', 'Sunday', 'Marathon', 'Man', 'Twilight', 'Last', 'Gleaming', 'Wilby', 'Conspiracy', 'perhaps', 'most', 'pointedly', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'also', 'happily', 'hat', 'more', 'once', 'Stanley', 'Kramer', '1959', 'classic', 'Defiant', 'Ones', '.Much', '1973', 'CIA-oriented', 'Three', 'Days', 'Condor', 'Espinosa', 'South', 'African-set', 'drama', 'dupe', 'who', ""n't"", 'KNOW', 'dupe', 'Redford', 'Condor', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'here', 'Safe', 'House', 'who', 'eventually', 'verrrry', 'unlikely', 'ally', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Condor', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Safe', 'House', 'two', 'men', 'working', 'government', 'agency', 'once', 'trusted', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'do', 'probably', 'very', 'wisely', 'so', 'out', '.However', 'what', 'Safe', 'House', 'REALLY', 'stand', 'out', 'Condor', 'particularly', 'are', 'dazzling/jaw-dropping', 'action', 'sequences', 'deft', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Guggenheim', 'director', 'Espinsosa', 'intersperse', 'relentless', 'extremely', 'tense', 'two-hour', 'drama', 'superbly-staged', 'car', 'chase', 'Cape', 'Town', 'rooftop', 'foot', 'chase', 'Johannesburg', 'shanty', 'town', 'number', 'hand-to-hand', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'are', 'most', 'believable', 'extension', 'most', 'gruesome', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'anytime', 'recently', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'release', 'may', 'least', 'partly', 'explain', 'why', 'Safe', 'House', 'was', 'huge', 'unqualified', 'hit', 'not', 'only', 'U.S.', 'rest', 'world', 'as', 'well', 'dazzling', 'action', 'set', 'pieces', 'tend', 'quite', 'easily', 'transcend', 'language', 'barriers', '.But', 'Safe', 'House', 'also', 'times', 'surprisingly', 'MOVING', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'reason', 'why', 'very', 'smart', 'well-executed', 'drama', 'stayed', 'longggg', 'first', 'theater', 'past', 'winter', 'very', 'palpable', 'powerful', 'emotional', 'gravity', 'movie', 'one', 'almost', 'never', 'find', 'big-budget', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'many', 'dazzling', 'action', 'sequences', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'could', 'definitely', 'learn', 'A', 'LOT', 'Espinosa', 'Ultimately', 'Safe', 'House', 'movie', 'truly', 'destructive', 'nature', 'lies', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'tell', 'also', 'what', 'do', 'who', 'are', 'receiving', 'end', 'Government', 'officials', 'globe', 'would', 'do', 'well', 'heed', 'film', 'cautionary', 'tale.Sumptuous', 'cinematography', 'Oliver', 'Wood', 'Die', 'Hard', '2', 'Face/Off', 'three', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'haunting', 'spare', 'score', 'Ramin', 'Djawadi']",N/A
1465411,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B005LAIGRS,Joker,"[4, 9]","For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...Safe House (2012) is just a typical action movie of the present day.  Very predictable.  Before watching this movie, I asked my nephew what it was about.  After he told me, I said, ""Now let me guess...there's going to be gunfire galore, fistfights, high speed chases down streets and freeways, lots of reckless driving, car crashes, and a passenger in the car is going to try to take over the wheel and has to fight the driver in order to get control of the car.""  The movie started.  Everything I predicted came true.  This is just a predictable action movie of today.  If you've seen one, you've seen them all.  This movie has a thin plot as well.  It doesn't matter who's playing the lead role, Denzel Washington or the man on the moon.  It doesn't matter.  It's just mindless action and violence that we've all seen thousands of times before.  Now, I like action movies, but so many of them are all the same.  The only ones I watch are the very best ones.  I always ask myself how much of this stuff do I really need to watch because it's all the same, just a different movie title and different actors.  Another thing about this movie is that the camerawork is horrendous.  It reminds me of camcorder movies like The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc.  The camera always moves left and right, up and down, zigzagging, etc. even while the subject being filmed is sitting stationary, such as a person sitting in a chair.

1465413,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B005LAIGRS,J. Richardson,"[1, 1]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Safe House is one of the many films I missed when it went into theaters. I recently rented, and watched, the film and I must say I was pretty impressed. Safe House stars big names Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Everything I've seen with Reynolds in the past has had him as a fun, carefree, character. In Safe House Reynolds plays a man working for the CIA who has to guard a safe house in Africa. Throughout the film it's clear Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a very complex character. It seems as if he wants to enjoy his job, but isn't really satisfied with it. On top of that he has to lie to his girlfriend about working for the CIA. Overall I felt Reynolds did a phenomenal job, I hope to see him play more roles like this in the future.Then we have Denzel Washington playing ex-CIA agent Tobin Frost. I must say over the years I have become very fond of Denzel as an actor. He always plays this calm, cool, collective badass who is two steps ahead of everyone. He always portrays a very strong, controlling, character. Well if you're a fan of Denzel nothing here is new. His character has all these traits, and no matter what happened in the film it seemed like just another day for Mr. Frost.The story isn't terrible, and neither is the writing, but the strong point of this film is the acting. Not just from Denzel and Reynolds, but from the whole cast. I felt at times the story felt a little generic, and there were times where the camera was a little shaky or placed at a weird angle. These are things to be expected from an action flick, but you would think directors would learn from these little things. They can sometimes make the difference between a good movie and an excellent film.Lastly the score composed by Ramin Djawadi is phenomenal. Not only does is fit the tone perfectly for each scene, but at times it makes the scene more intense which, for me, makes it more enjoyable. I'm definitely going to check out the soundtrack, just to see if it's as good as it is in the film.Overall Score: 7.5/10 - Safe House does have it's flaws, but what film doesn't? What we are given is a strong action thriller with excellent acting from an amazing cast. I would definitely recommend watching this if you're given the opportunity.",4,7.5/10 - Good,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2292,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.Safe', 'House', 'one', 'many', 'films', 'missed', 'when', 'went', 'theaters', 'recently', 'rented', 'watched', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'impressed', 'Safe', 'House', 'big', 'names', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Reynolds', 'past', 'had', 'fun', 'carefree', 'character', 'Safe', 'House', 'Reynolds', 'man', 'working', 'CIA', 'who', 'guard', 'safe', 'house', 'Africa', 'film', 'clear', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Reynolds', 'very', 'complex', 'character', 'enjoy', 'job', ""n't"", 'really', 'satisfied', 'top', 'lie', 'girlfriend', 'working', 'CIA', 'Overall', 'felt', 'Reynolds', 'did', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'hope', 'see', 'play', 'more', 'roles', 'future.Then', 'have', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'playing', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'must', 'say', 'years', 'have', 'become', 'very', 'fond', 'Denzel', 'actor', 'always', 'calm', 'cool', 'collective', 'badass', 'who', 'two', 'steps', 'ahead', 'everyone', 'always', 'very', 'strong', 'controlling', 'character', 'Well', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Denzel', 'nothing', 'here', 'new', 'character', 'traits', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'film', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'day', 'Mr.', 'Frost.The', 'story', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'writing', 'strong', 'point', 'film', 'acting', 'Not', 'just', 'Denzel', 'Reynolds', 'whole', 'cast', 'felt', 'times', 'story', 'felt', 'little', 'generic', 'were', 'times', 'where', 'camera', 'was', 'little', 'shaky', 'placed', 'weird', 'angle', 'are', 'things', 'be', 'expected', 'action', 'flick', 'would', 'think', 'directors', 'would', 'learn', 'little', 'things', 'can', 'sometimes', 'make', 'difference', 'good', 'movie', 'excellent', 'film.Lastly', 'score', 'composed', 'Ramin', 'Djawadi', 'phenomenal', 'Not', 'only', 'fit', 'tone', 'perfectly', 'scene', 'times', 'scene', 'more', 'intense', 'more', 'enjoyable', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'going', 'check', 'out', 'soundtrack', 'just', 'see', 'as', 'good', 'film.Overall', 'Score', '7.5/10', 'Safe', 'House', 'have', 'flaws', 'what', 'film', ""n't"", 'What', 'are', 'given', 'strong', 'action', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'acting', 'amazing', 'cast', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', ""'re"", 'given', 'opportunity']",N/A

When the first and only occupant he's had proves to be the most dangerous man he's ever met, Weston readies for duty. Tobin Frost has eluded capture for almost a decade. One of the best ops men that the CIA's known, the ex-intelligence officer has given up assets and sold military intel to anyone with cash since he turned. From trading secrets to North Korea to aiding splinter cells, the damage he's done to the U.S. is immeasurable. And he's now back on the reservation with a secret. As soon as Frost is brought in for debriefing, mercenaries come and tear apart Weston's safe house. Barely escaping, the unlikely partners must discover if their attackers have been sent by terrorists or someone on the inside who will kill anyone standing in the way. Now it's up to Weston to figure out who he can trust before they're both eliminated from the game.The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also executive produced) (as Tobin Frost) & Ryan Reynolds (as Matt Weston) is great.

The big surprise here was Reynolds' quickly improving acting chops. Hanging with the big boys is showing him what real acting looks like, and like his character here he's a quick study. So there's the lesson for all you wanna-be leading men: it's easy, just marry then divorce the hottest actress in Hollyweird while honing your acting, then watch the great roles come rolling in. I think I'll try that out later this year. Anyone got SJ's cell number?This flick has tons of good action and also a very intelligent script that asks many of the right questions about the CIA. It seems to suggest that plenty of the top Agency folks are corrupt at best, which is of course confirmed by so many ex-agents' memoirs. But seeing as the extras (which are quite good, lots of little docs) point out that a 30-year Agency vet did all the details here, you have to wonder, as always in the world of triple agents and daily media deceit, if we're not meant to think the CIA always finds and gets rid of their own bad guys. Uh huh.Which makes the ending all the better, if just for its basic premise: speaking truth to power and doing the right thing trumps patriotism, in any country. Well, this is fiction after all. Gleeson is as usual perfect; this increasingly ubiquitous fellow is the next Michael Caine. But it's Reynolds who really carries this, being in almost every scene, and he looks like the next great all-around leading man at this point.Denzel also has some truly fine moments, including the very disturbing waterboarding scene. Is this what we're fighting for? Nope, just corporate profits, naturally.A very fast, well-made action spy-thriller with good acting and a tight script, Safe House also gets a fine blu-ray transfer, and it looks crisp and real.

The main actor is Denzel Washington who is CIA agent that some say has gone rogue. He comes across a secret electronic device by chance that everybody wants. To complicate matters there is a mole in the CIA organization that is unknown to all. But he is like left-handed monkey wrench. He has lots of directing authority and his actions are never question. Meanwhile there is a group of bad people who want Tobin Frost death. They want what he has and will stop at nothing to get it. So, Washington is on the run only scant seconds ahead of those who are chasing him. In a blaze of gunfire and car chases Washington barely escapes and keeps on running. The problem is he is running out of options. So Washington turns himself into the CIA. He comes in out of the cold. The CIA team takes him to a ""Safe House"" run by the actor Ryan Reynolds who is the ""Keeper"" of the ""Safe House."" Reynolds does a superb job of acting as Matt Weston who operates a ""Safe House"" with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment. Although he has the skills he lacks seniority. The interrogation begins but there are too many questions with very few answers. Meanwhile the bad guys attack the ""Safe House.""  The world as they know it explodes with Washington and Reynolds on the run or chasing each other. The mole continues doing his dirty work and Washington must improvise and overcome to stay ahead of all the groups of bad guys who have now joined in the chase. Washington saves the life of Reynolds but in so doing puts his own life in jeopardy. He tells Reynolds what the final after-action briefing with the CIA Director will be like. Then he dies. So the ending is weak because I feel a stronger ending would have been better. Say vanishing like a ghost into the murky waters of oblivion or something like that. Now the last scene does work for me. It brings closure to a wild shoot-them-up film. The director did a great job with all the subplots that came at the viewer like being in an old-fashion snowball fight at recess. So I recommend this movie to all fans of Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. I loved it. So, I gave it five stars. This review does not in any way spoil it for those who have yet not seen this film.

Sure this has been done before - but what's makes this espionage movie so different is the sheer effort the cast, crew and writers put into depicting the 'thrill' in 'thriller'. You can literally feel them working their well-paid butts off to please you in every possible way. Add to this formidable stew of film-making excellence - a cleverly chosen cast of top class actors like Denzel Washington, Sam Sheppard, Robert Patrick, Vera Farmiga, Fares Fares, Ruben Blades and the superb Irish duo of Brendan Gleeson and Liam Cunningham - and you can almost forgive Ryan Reynolds trying to break free from rom-coms and getting all John McClane sweaty teeshirt on us...As you can imagine the action comes at you fast and furious. The fight sequences were choreographed for months in advance (using the actors themselves) and escalate in their ingenuity and hands-on nature - while the car chases are pulse-pounding too. But its the great cast who give it a beating heart. With the exception of say Liam Neeson or Tommy Lee Jones - I couldn't see any other leading man bring so much to a cop/agent as Denzel Washington does. He is typically brilliant here. He plays Tobin Frost - the CIA's more-wanted whistleblower (off the grid for a decade) who suddenly waltzes into the American Embassy in South Africa's capital city of Cape Town. Years of interrogation techniques under his belt and a file in his leg that will fry many dodgy types on different continents - Tobin smiles, grimaces and generally messes with everyone's head. Digging in to find more nuances - Denzel is magnificent at this - and it goes a long way to keeping you watching as the begrudging relationship develops between his character (the old timer on the run) and Reynolds character Matt Weston (the rookie forcing into protecting him from all comers). And on it goes to a final show-and-tell gun battle in another compromised 'safe house' where the young buck Matt has been seriously underestimated by everyone - including the good guy/bad guy Tobin Frost (dialogue above)...The BLU RAY picture isn't great it has to be said because Director Daniel Espinosa is going for gritty realism and not clean cut - but it does show off the superb and extensive use of Cape Town as a city and the South African countryside that surrounds it which has a certain beautiful light - and look. Placing it in this unusual location gives the street action (and shanty town sequences) a fresh feel too. And don't watch the extras 'before' the movie - they give away far too much plot.A bit of a cracker frankly...PS: Look out too for the unpronounceable NORA ARNEZEDER who plays the 23-year old French girlfriend Ana - I'm certain she's been genetically engineered by the CIA to be one of the most gorgeous women on Earth - and will therefore turn out to be the 'sleeper agent' in ""Safe House 2 - The Sequel - Even Safer Than The Last House"".You heard it here first folks...",4,"""...You're Better Than Me...""",1349568000,"10 7, 2012",2012,3058,"['Safe', 'House', 'souped-up', 'Bourne', 'directed', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'frantic', 'pace', 'sinister', 'synths', 'choppy-choppy', 'editing', 'Sure', 'been', 'done', 'what', 'espionage', 'movie', 'so', 'different', 'sheer', 'effort', 'cast', 'crew', 'writers', 'put', 'depicting', ""'thrill"", ""'thriller"", 'can', 'literally', 'feel', 'working', 'well-paid', 'butts', 'please', 'possible', 'way', 'Add', 'formidable', 'stew', 'film-making', 'excellence', 'cleverly', 'chosen', 'cast', 'top', 'class', 'actors', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Sam', 'Sheppard', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Fares', 'Fares', 'Ruben', 'Blades', 'superb', 'Irish', 'duo', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Liam', 'Cunningham', 'can', 'almost', 'forgive', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'trying', 'break', 'free', 'rom-coms', 'getting', 'John', 'McClane', 'sweaty', 'teeshirt', 'can', 'imagine', 'action', 'fast', 'furious', 'fight', 'sequences', 'were', 'choreographed', 'months', 'advance', 'using', 'actors', 'escalate', 'ingenuity', 'hands-on', 'nature', 'car', 'chases', 'are', 'pulse-pounding', 'too', 'great', 'cast', 'who', 'give', 'beating', 'heart', 'exception', 'say', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'other', 'leading', 'man', 'bring', 'so', 'much', 'cop/agent', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'typically', 'brilliant', 'here', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'CIA', 'more-wanted', 'whistleblower', 'grid', 'decade', 'who', 'suddenly', 'American', 'Embassy', 'South', 'Africa', 'capital', 'city', 'Cape', 'Town', 'Years', 'interrogation', 'techniques', 'belt', 'file', 'leg', 'will', 'fry', 'many', 'dodgy', 'types', 'different', 'continents', 'Tobin', 'smiles', 'grimaces', 'generally', 'messes', 'everyone', 'head', 'Digging', 'find', 'more', 'nuances', 'Denzel', 'magnificent', 'long', 'way', 'keeping', 'watching', 'begrudging', 'relationship', 'character', 'old', 'timer', 'run', 'Reynolds', 'character', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'rookie', 'forcing', 'protecting', 'comers', 'final', 'show-and-tell', 'gun', 'battle', 'compromised', 'house', 'where', 'young', 'buck', 'Matt', 'been', 'seriously', 'underestimated', 'everyone', 'including', 'good', 'guy/bad', 'guy', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'dialogue', 'BLU', 'RAY', 'picture', ""n't"", 'great', 'be', 'said', 'Director', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'going', 'gritty', 'realism', 'not', 'clean', 'cut', 'show', 'off', 'superb', 'extensive', 'use', 'Cape', 'Town', 'city', 'South', 'African', 'countryside', 'certain', 'beautiful', 'light', 'look', 'Placing', 'unusual', 'location', 'street', 'action', 'shanty', 'town', 'sequences', 'fresh', 'feel', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'extras', 'movie', 'give', 'away', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'plot.A', 'bit', 'cracker', 'frankly', 'PS', 'Look', 'out', 'too', 'unpronounceable', 'NORA', 'ARNEZEDER', 'who', '23-year', 'old', 'French', 'girlfriend', 'Ana', ""'m"", 'certain', 'been', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'CIA', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'women', 'Earth', 'will', 'therefore', 'turn', 'out', 'be', ""'sleeper"", 'agent', 'Safe', 'House', '2', 'Sequel', 'Even', 'Safer', 'Last', 'House', 'heard', 'here', 'first', 'folks']",N/A

Immediately after requesting a transfer, he receives an unexpected guest: Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a CIA agent that went rogue nearly a decade ago, voluntarily turns himself into the American consulate and is brought to Weston for safekeeping. Unfortunately, the safe house turns out to be not so safe, and Weston finds himself escorting Frost to the proper authorities on his own. Now, if only he could figure out who the proper authorities are.Cue: car chases, gun fights, close quarters combat, and a few half-hearted red herrings.I'm a huge fan of Reynolds. I enjoy him even when he's starring inunwatchable dreck. Denzel Washington, too, is a captivating actor. Both of them do an excellent job in this film, selling their characters' flaws and virtues without overdoing it. The rest of the cast is peppered with more well-tested talent -- Vera Farmiga (The Departed), Brendan Gleeson (Harry Potter), Sam Shepard (Black Hawk Down), Robert Patrick (Terminator 2), and Liam Cunningham (Game of Thrones, Season 3) -- but none of these people are really given the opportunity to do much. Their characters fill a prescribed role, and the script doesn't really give them leeway to deviate.The action is brisk, slick, and well-edited without being completely over-the-top. Our leads seem a little more prone to bruises and cuts than your average action movie protagonist. When Frost is waterboarded at the start of the film, he handles the torture stonily, but you can hear the wet rattle in his lungs and see him struggling for a good breath, even after the experience is over. Weston endures quite a beating, and although he makes it to the end of the film (come on; it's Ryan Reynold as the lead character; this isn't a spoiler) it's not without some serious costs.It's all well and good and very, very familiar. The story doesn't have any new tricks up its sleeve, and although its presentation is nearly flawless, the plot's lack of depth, risk, or any inventiveness at all make the whole film feel like a loud, brassy, colorful way to twiddle your thumbs for two hours. ""That was a pretty good movie,"" my girlfriend said afterwards, ""but I can already tell I'm going to forget we even watched it by the end of the week."" She's right. Absent any really new elements to recommend it, the flick feels like a well-choreographed summary of a story that's been told many, many times before. If you have 110 minutes to kill and you don't necessarily care for surprises, it's a movie worth seeing.

1465456,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B005LAIGRS,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","Is it just me or has anyone else noticed that as Denzel Washington gets older he's playing more and more characters with killer instincts? In SAFE HOUSE, Washington once more plays a character that you hope you never find tracking you down or waiting in your home.The film opens with Washington meeting a member of MI6, Britain's spy agency, and receiving a microchip filled with information. Heading to the bathroom of the restaurant they're in, he injects it into his hip. When the bad guys come knocking on the restroom door Washington dispatches them with ease and escapes. The MI6 agent picks him up in his car but before they can get away he's shot. Washington makes his escape to the American consulate and turns himself in.We discover that Washington's name is Tobin Frost, an ex-CIA agent who went off the grid and has been selling secrets to various organizations around the world. Considered a traitor, the consulate turns out to be in South Africa and he's to be taken to a safe house until a team can get to him and ""extract"" information from him.The safe house is operated by a fairly new agent named Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). It's his first assignment with the CIA and he wants to impress, to move forward. He gets his chance when the information team arrives closely followed by the hit squad that was chasing Frost to begin with. They take out the team but before they can take Frost, Weston escapes with him only to be tracked down. They eventually escape but you know this assassination team will eventually find them.Calling in, Weston is told that he needs to move forward to another location and pick up the means necessary to get Frost to another safe house in South Africa. After picking up the package with various items he needs at lockers in a crowded soccer stadium, Frost causes a scene claiming he's been kidnapped. The security believes him and ignores Weston's pleas only to have Frost kill his guards and escape. Weston follows suit and continues his chase of Frost.But there's more going on here than a simple chase film. The movie is also about what caused Frost to become who he is today and watches as Weston alters from a totally innocent and naive agent into something much more deadly. The fact that Frost has a background in psychological warfare makes the viewer wonder is he just trying to mess with Weston's head or is he trying to help he get a view of the bigger picture? The answer to that question isn't offered until near the end of the film.Another question that runs through the film is the fact that somewhere in the CIA there is a traitor. How is it that the assassination team knew where the safe house was? How have they been able to track down Frost as he moves from place to place? And who gave them the information that led them to him at the beginning of the film? As viewers we wonder about these questions. As a participant, Weston must try and find the answers to these questions as well, never knowing who is an ally or foe.The film moves at a frantic pace with tons of car chases, gun fights and hand to hand combat sequences. Unlike the spy films of the past, people actually get shot, stabbed and bleed. There is a touch more realism here than spy films past. But that goes hand in hand with the story of undeserved loyalty and questions of deciphering who exactly the bad guy is.Washington has never been better. There are subtle plays at work here he delivers that make you wonder if Frost is good, bad or indifferent. The answer is found by the end of the film. Reynolds does an equally great job portraying an innocence in his character that gets jaded as the film progresses. How he ends up, what he will become is also answered by the end of the film.Most films like these today are compared less with Bond and more with Jason Bourne. This film is grittier than the Bourne films and much more so than the Bond series. It will hold your attention and have you guessing from start to finish as to what is actually on the microchip that Frost has possession of. It delivers the goods from start to finish an is well worth taking the time to sit back, watch and enjoy.",3,NOT QUITE BOURNE,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",2012,4139,"['just', 'anyone', 'else', 'noticed', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'older', 'playing', 'more', 'more', 'characters', 'killer', 'instincts', 'SAFE', 'HOUSE', 'Washington', 'once', 'more', 'plays', 'character', 'hope', 'never', 'find', 'tracking', 'down', 'waiting', 'home.The', 'film', 'Washington', 'meeting', 'member', 'MI6', 'Britain', 'spy', 'agency', 'receiving', 'microchip', 'filled', 'information', 'Heading', 'bathroom', 'restaurant', ""'re"", 'hip', 'When', 'bad', 'guys', 'come', 'knocking', 'restroom', 'door', 'Washington', 'ease', 'escapes', 'MI6', 'agent', 'up', 'car', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'shot', 'Washington', 'escape', 'American', 'consulate', 'in.We', 'discover', 'Washington', 'name', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'went', 'grid', 'been', 'selling', 'secrets', 'various', 'organizations', 'world', 'Considered', 'traitor', 'consulate', 'out', 'be', 'South', 'Africa', 'be', 'taken', 'safe', 'house', 'team', 'can', 'get', 'extract', 'information', 'him.The', 'safe', 'house', 'operated', 'fairly', 'new', 'agent', 'named', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'first', 'assignment', 'CIA', 'impress', 'move', 'forward', 'chance', 'when', 'information', 'team', 'closely', 'followed', 'hit', 'squad', 'was', 'chasing', 'Frost', 'begin', 'take', 'out', 'team', 'can', 'take', 'Frost', 'Weston', 'only', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'eventually', 'escape', 'know', 'assassination', 'team', 'will', 'eventually', 'find', 'them.Calling', 'Weston', 'told', 'move', 'forward', 'location', 'pick', 'up', 'means', 'necessary', 'get', 'Frost', 'safe', 'house', 'South', 'Africa', 'picking', 'up', 'package', 'various', 'items', 'lockers', 'crowded', 'soccer', 'stadium', 'Frost', 'scene', 'claiming', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'security', 'Weston', 'pleas', 'only', 'have', 'Frost', 'kill', 'guards', 'escape', 'Weston', 'suit', 'chase', 'Frost.But', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'simple', 'chase', 'film', 'movie', 'also', 'what', 'caused', 'Frost', 'become', 'who', 'today', 'watches', 'Weston', 'alters', 'totally', 'innocent', 'naive', 'agent', 'something', 'much', 'more', 'deadly', 'fact', 'Frost', 'background', 'psychological', 'warfare', 'viewer', 'wonder', 'just', 'trying', 'mess', 'Weston', 'head', 'trying', 'help', 'get', 'view', 'bigger', 'picture', 'answer', 'question', ""n't"", 'offered', 'end', 'film.Another', 'question', 'film', 'fact', 'somewhere', 'CIA', 'traitor', 'How', 'assassination', 'team', 'knew', 'where', 'safe', 'house', 'was', 'How', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'track', 'down', 'Frost', 'place', 'place', 'who', 'gave', 'information', 'led', 'beginning', 'film', 'viewers', 'wonder', 'questions', 'participant', 'Weston', 'must', 'try', 'find', 'answers', 'questions', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'knowing', 'who', 'ally', 'foe.The', 'film', 'moves', 'frantic', 'pace', 'tons', 'car', 'chases', 'gun', 'fights', 'hand', 'hand', 'combat', 'sequences', 'spy', 'films', 'past', 'people', 'actually', 'get', 'shot', 'stabbed', 'bleed', 'touch', 'more', 'realism', 'here', 'spy', 'films', 'past', 'hand', 'hand', 'story', 'undeserved', 'loyalty', 'questions', 'deciphering', 'who', 'exactly', 'bad', 'guy', 'is.Washington', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'subtle', 'plays', 'work', 'here', 'make', 'wonder', 'Frost', 'good', 'bad', 'indifferent', 'answer', 'found', 'end', 'film', 'Reynolds', 'equally', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'innocence', 'character', 'jaded', 'film', 'How', 'up', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'also', 'answered', 'end', 'film.Most', 'films', 'today', 'are', 'compared', 'less', 'Bond', 'more', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'film', 'grittier', 'Bourne', 'films', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'Bond', 'series', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'have', 'guessing', 'start', 'finish', 'what', 'actually', 'microchip', 'Frost', 'possession', 'goods', 'start', 'finish', 'well', 'worth', 'taking', 'time', 'sit', 'back', 'watch', 'enjoy']",N/A

Moore,"[4, 7]","Daniel Espinosa's ""Safe House"" is an efficient spy thriller that gives viewers a gratifying number of heart-pounding moments, even though it evaporates from the memory fairly quickly. Denzel Washington plays Tobin Frost, a rogue ex-CIA operative captured in Cape Town and brought in for questioning. Through a series of violent events that is no fair to reveal, Frost ends up in the care of rookie agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), whom Frost openly mocks as a greenhorn. The car chases and shootouts in ""Safe House"" are absolutely state-of-the-art, and the screenplay is clever enough to blend the plot exposition in neatly with the action. It's too bad, then, that none of the characters is really memorable, even though the film boasts a glittering cast--not only Washington and Reynolds but also Sam Shepard, Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, Robert Patrick and Ruben Blades, all playing characters who may or may not be what they seem.

This time it's Ryan Reynolds trying to atone for his green-suited comic book hero. The good news is that they both succeed in their roles for the most part. There isn't much new here. We have Tobin Frost (Washington) who is a rogue intelligence agent that is hunted by some bad guys and of course the CIA. As a way of escaping the bad guys he walks into the American consulate in Cape Town, South Africa. After a little water boarding he is taken to a ""safe house"" which is managed by Matt Weston who is bored out of his mind and looking for a little action. Well, he gets it with both barrels.The wrinkle in this espionage thriller is that someone within the CIA is on the take and is alerting the bad guys as to Tobin's whereabouts. Pretty quickly we know it is likely one of two people. Go ahead and flip a coin. You'll have a 50/50 chance of guessing correctly. Why does everyone want Tobin's head? Well, he has a little microchip which contains the names of intelligence operatives who are selling information to the aforementioned bad guys. Matt and Tobin become unlikely allies in their attempt to stay alive. We get plenty of well done car chases, gun fights, close quarter fisticuffs and ghetto roof-top chases that we expect. And they are all tension filled. Some of the quick-cut editing was a bit disconcerting at times but I think that was just Swedish director Daniel Espinosa's style.The cast is supplemented by Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga and Sam Shepard as CIA higher-ups. While obviously I think the film has its share of flaws and been-there-done-that action, I have to say I got caught up in it and certainly was never bored.

Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) stars opposite as the promotion-hungry CIA agent stuck in the dead-end job of watching over safe houses. In most movies, safe houses are places police and the FBI use to hide key witnesses that are unsafe anywhere else. In this arena, the safe house is an extraction point where individuals of interest are stored, interrogated and/or tortured if need be.This is a familiar role for Washington who taps in to his Alonzo from Training Day style to create a character that appears wholly evil, but possible a misunderstood shepherd in sheep&#8217;s clothing.

stifling post and he has been itching for a transfer....anywhere.Into this relatively boring routine steps one Tobin Frost,played by Denzel Washington.Frost is a former member of the CIA,just like Weston,but who climbed the ladder and became a first class interrogator.Frost has obtained a list made by Israeli intelligence listing all the bad apples in similar organizations around the world.A friend in MI6 has given him the list and he is now on the run from those who wish that list captured and destroyed.In other words Frost is a dead man.He turns himself into the local US embassy and he is in turn moved into Weston`s safe house.It is not long before the safe house itself is under attack and Weston is fleeing across town with his prisoner.Weston is ordered to go to a stadium during a soccer game to retrieve a GPS which will tell Weston the location of the nearest safe house.However during this time Frost manages to escape.Weston reports in that he has lost his prisoner and is also on the run from the local police himself,due to a scuffle at the stadium.Meanwhile Frost has gone to the house of an old friend to have him make him a passport.During this time Weston has an idea on where Frost may be and heads out.The men who attacked the safe house have followed Frost and are now bashing in the door of his friend`s home.His friend lies dead as he flees.Weston has arrived on the scene and helps save Frost and abscond with him to a new safe house.Frost and Weston arrive at the new location and are just settling in when the safe house attendant turns on Weston and he is again in a struggle for his life.Weston barely comes out alive and he makes it back to Frost who he cuffed to a pipe in a room.Weston asks what exactly these people are after and Frost tells him exactly what it entails.Frost then grabs the cuff keys from a semi conscious Weston and escapes.When Weston regains consciousness he is in a bed with his CIA boss from the States beside him,asking what has happened and the whereabouts of Frost.The answer is not long coming as Frost suddenly reappears shooting his way back into the house to get Weston.Frost gets blindsided and shot by Weston`s boss and eventually dies.Weston`s boss is shot in turn by Weston and Weston now has the secret Frost carried.Back at CIA headquarters Weston submits his report to the director who asks about the documents Frost had.Weston feigns innocence,knowing how damaging those secrets are.The film ends as the CIA and agencies of similar ilk around the world,have their top agents arrested for illegal activities.Frost`s original intentions come to fruition thanks to Weston.The film starts out slowly as we are introduced to the two main characters.The moment Frost is driving away with his MI6 contact,who suddenly gets shot while driving,the heat,as they say,is on and the film never stops until the end.One doesn`t know who to trust and the cold,calculating killer and traitor that Frost is first portrayed as,starts to unravel,slowly but surely.And everywhere Frost goes,assassins follow,which is just another on-going mystery on top of many others thrown into the mix.Washington and Reynolds are both outstanding in their roles and play their roles with an intensity that is right on the beam.Washington as Frost is as cold and stoic as his name implies and Reynolds plays the bored CIA agent whose life is suddenly turned topsy turvy and who is soon fighting for his life,wonderfully.Washington also directed this thriller and does a great job at that post also.Technically the film is clear and crisp in it w/s a/r of 2:40:1.Extras include four featurettes and the trailer.All in all a highly recommended piece of film making.As a highly intense drama/thriller they do not get much better than this.It is violent,but it is all justifiable within the film`s context;not violence for violence sake.Buy it today.",4,4 1/2 stars-Adrenaline Rush!,1340496000,"06 24,

Well, its not often the viewer can correct defects in the theatrical release. But with the ff and stop-action buttons, those things that raced heedlessly across the screen now obey your will.  Another compaint was that the movie was by the numbers and held no surprises.  But I was surprised several times. One surprise was Ryan Reynolds.  He sank into this role with a gritty bearing far, far outside the comic domain.

And indeed the Denzel character works. The last time I saw Denzel not playing the same character that he was playing in Safe House was all the way back in 1992's Malcolm X (he played Malcolm X).But still...I was certainly entertained by Safe House. As the story goes, Ryan Reynolds is a green CIA agent house-sitting an empty CIA Safe House in South Africa. But the Safe House isn't empty for long; some agents show up with Denzel in tow as their prisoner, and the action begins when powerful forces show up to make sure that the Safe House is the last place that Denzel ever sees.All in all, Safe House was a good movie.

After borrowing the movie from a friend, I know that I saved myself $20.It's not that Safe House is terrible, it's just formulaic, mediocre, and badly-written.The basic story is built around Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who looks after a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The job involves a lot of sitting around, but he springs into action when he learns that Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue CIA agent, has been captured, and will be delivered into his custody. When a recovery team, led by Agent Kiefer (Robert Patrick), is attacked and defeated, Weston is left to bring Frost in himself.Weston is ambitious and wants to work at a more high profile location, but he's young and unproven in the eyes of his bosses. We are shown how he is regarded during an exchange involving his superiors, Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Linklater (Vera Farmiga), at HQ.Imagine you were given the chance to write the screenplay. How would you make it stand out from previous entries in the genre? We have seen this subject handled well in the Bourne series, and reasonably well in Salt. Safe House doesn't belong in the same class.What's wrong with the movie? The excellent cast is virtually ignored. Instead of establishing the characters and giving them depth, we are given very little background information. The front cover promises an adrenaline rush, and that's all that we are given. If you love action movies and don't care about the plot, Safe House delivers. But if you want to know why these events are occurring, it's not exactly an important part of the mix. There's a lot of gunfire, but meaningful dialogue is at a minimum.If I had the pleasure of directing actors like Washington, Farmiga and Gleeson, I would make use of their abilities. Washington doesn't put a foot wrong, he's just given nothing to work with. Farmiga's screen time is extremely limited, but remember how effective she was in a similar role in The Departed? Gleeson is one of a kind and excelled in movies such as In Bruges and The Guard, but his character has no depth in Safe House. I see this as a wasted opportunity.In the Bourne movies, we see how Jason Bourne meets his girlfriend, and how that relationship becomes meaningful. When she is threatened, we feel his pain and we react. Weston's girlfriend in Safe House may as well have been a cardboard cutout, and as a result, we feel nothing when he examines their relationship.Safe House focuses on the action element. You'll see shootouts, car chases, explosions and people running. You might even understand why all this is happening, even though it's just a by-the-numbers screenplay. The movie grossed over $200 million and you won't scream for your money back, but I wouldn't bother buying the Blu-ray unless you are an action junkie. I love the cast, but against my expectations, I'm severely disappointed by the end result. Watch Bourne again instead, or watch Anton Corbijn's, The American, as that actually has some fresh ideas.",3,"I love the casting, but the movie is unremarkable",1342224000,"07 14, 2012",2012,3108,"['almost', 'went', 'see', 'Safe', 'House', 'theater', 'barely', 'resisted', 'urge', 'blind-buy', 'Blu-ray', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'borrowing', 'movie', 'friend', 'know', 'saved', '20.It', 'not', 'Safe', 'House', 'terrible', 'just', 'formulaic', 'mediocre', 'badly-written.The', 'basic', 'story', 'built', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'who', 'safe', 'house', 'Cape', 'Town', 'South', 'Africa', 'job', 'lot', 'sitting', 'around', 'action', 'when', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'rogue', 'CIA', 'agent', 'been', 'captured', 'will', 'be', 'delivered', 'custody', 'When', 'recovery', 'team', 'led', 'Agent', 'Kiefer', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'attacked', 'defeated', 'Weston', 'left', 'bring', 'Frost', 'himself.Weston', 'ambitious', 'work', 'more', 'high', 'profile', 'location', 'young', 'unproven', 'eyes', 'bosses', 'are', 'shown', 'how', 'regarded', 'exchange', 'involving', 'superiors', 'Barlow', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'Linklater', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'HQ.Imagine', 'were', 'given', 'chance', 'write', 'screenplay', 'How', 'would', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'previous', 'entries', 'genre', 'have', 'seen', 'subject', 'handled', 'well', 'Bourne', 'series', 'reasonably', 'well', 'Salt', 'Safe', 'House', ""n't"", 'belong', 'same', 'class.What', 'wrong', 'movie', 'excellent', 'cast', 'virtually', 'ignored', 'Instead', 'establishing', 'characters', 'giving', 'depth', 'are', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'background', 'information', 'front', 'cover', 'adrenaline', 'rush', 'are', 'given', 'love', 'action', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'plot', 'Safe', 'House', 'delivers', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'events', 'are', 'occurring', 'not', 'exactly', 'important', 'part', 'mix', 'lot', 'gunfire', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'minimum.If', 'had', 'pleasure', 'directing', 'actors', 'Washington', 'Farmiga', 'Gleeson', 'would', 'make', 'use', 'abilities', 'Washington', ""n't"", 'put', 'foot', 'wrong', 'just', 'given', 'nothing', 'work', 'Farmiga', 'screen', 'time', 'extremely', 'limited', 'remember', 'how', 'effective', 'was', 'similar', 'role', 'Departed', 'Gleeson', 'one', 'kind', 'excelled', 'movies', 'such', 'Bruges', 'Guard', 'character', 'depth', 'Safe', 'House', 'see', 'wasted', 'Bourne', 'movies', 'see', 'how', 'Jason', 'Bourne', 'girlfriend', 'how', 'relationship', 'meaningful', 'When', 'threatened', 'feel', 'pain', 'react', 'Weston', 'girlfriend', 'Safe', 'House', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'cardboard', 'cutout', 'result', 'feel', 'nothing', 'when', 'relationship.Safe', 'House', 'action', 'element', ""'ll"", 'see', 'shootouts', 'car', 'chases', 'explosions', 'people', 'running', 'might', 'even', 'understand', 'why', 'happening', 'even', 'just', 'by-the-numbers', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'grossed', '200', 'million', 'wo', ""n't"", 'scream', 'money', 'back', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'buying', 'Blu-ray', 'are', 'action', 'junkie', 'love', 'cast', 'expectations', ""'m"", 'severely', 'disappointed', 'end', 'result', 'Watch', 'Bourne', 'again', 'instead', 'watch', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'American', 'actually', 'fresh', 'ideas']",N/A

He operates a safe house with nobody in it. He wants a European field assignment, but lacks department seniority.The movie switches to Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) obtaining an embarrassing electronic file from the MI6 in South Africa. ""Frost"", because he is cold. Denzel uses his expected savvy to escape. He is a rogue super agent who free lances, buying and selling information. In order to escape the bad guys, Tobin surrenders to the CIA. Now the questions are: Was this his original plan? What is on the file?Tobin is taken to our aforesaid safe house for intense interrogation.I loved the opening of the interrogation scene. The interrogator says, ""I'm here to advise you of your rights. You're being held under national security order 600 which means you have none.""Frost is too important of a person and the top secret safe house comes under attack. The young low level highly trained Matt Weston is now on the run with a man who is a master manipulator of people. To our list of unanswered questions we now add, ""Who is the mole?""Ryan and Washington give us excellent performances.

1465560,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B005LAIGRS,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA Agent eager for a new assignment. After almost a year as the ""landlord"" of a safe house in Cape Town, he wants to transfer to a more high-profile gig. He spends his days bouncing a ball against the walls, trying to stave off boredom. He is surprised to get a last minute reservation; the CIA has captured Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a notorious and very dangerous ex-CIA agent who is now considered a traitor. No sooner has Frost been brought in than a group of renegades break into the safe house and start shooting. Matt manages to smuggle Tobin out and the chase begins.Written by David Guggenheim (his second film) and directed by Daniel Espinosa (his first Hollywood film), ""Safe House"" has all the makings of a top-notch thriller directed by Tony Scott. In fact, I thought it was a Tony Scott film when I saw the trailer for the first time. But that isn't a compliment.The film begins by establishing both lead characters. We spend a significant amount of time watching Tobin weave in and out of the crowds and dark alleyways of Cape Town. Eventually, he meets another agent and buys a chip containing some very damaging information. Once he takes possession, it seems like everyone is out to get him. But Tobin has some moves and manages to escape them every time. Well, almost every time...Matt wakes up next to his beautiful French girlfriend and they talk about the future. She wants to move back to France and he is itching for a different assignment. He pushes his mentor (Brendan Glesson) to get him reassigned. At lunch, she says she doesn't have to be at work for an hour, they should go back home and make love. At work, he walks the empty halls of the 'clinic' and eventually starts bouncing a ball against the wall.All of this is actually interesting because it helps to establish and build each of these characters, giving us some insight into their lives and we realize each one is in a very different place with a completely different skill set. Through the course of the chase, each person will have to rely on the other and use their skills to help both of them survive.Once the men break into the safe house and start shooting, everything starts to go wrong.As soon as Tobin arrives, he size up Matt. The men who have captured Tobin push the younger agent to one side, treating him like the insignificant innkeeper he is. Nothing escapes Tobin's eyes and he turns on the Hannibal Lecter-ese; the crazy, super-intelligent mad man persona. He starts to goad Matt, saying things like ""Tick Tock"" to get the younger, less experienced agent to make a rash decision. He doesn't expect Matt to be of any consequence.Matt is inexperienced, but because he wants a more exciting post, he isn't about to let anything happen to Tobin and smuggles him out steps ahead of the men who stormed the safe house.Once Matt and Tobin start to run through the streets, trying to evade the men, the film becomes incredibly routine.These characters are a fun thing to watch. For a few minutes. And then you realize you have seen these types of performances a million times before. It just becomes so boring, so quickly.Washington is a great actor and always brings a palpable intensity to his performances. And Tobin Frost is no exception. From the moment we first set eyes on Tobin, we know there is something going on beneath the surface. He isn't telling everything to everyone. He has some ulterior motive to his actions.But he has done this type of character before. And there really isn't anything new in this portrayal.I think Washington is a cinematic tour de force, but he needs better direction. He works with Tony Scott on an abnormally frequent basis. Many successful directors and actors have created legacies together. Scorcese and DeNiro and DiCaprio. Hitchcock and Grant and Stewart. Ford and Wayne. Huston and Bogart. There are many, many more. And you can just tick off the names of movies that will stand the test of time associated with each of these teams. On the flipside, many successful, well-known actors continue to work with the same people. This doesn't stretch their talents and they continue to make the same films. Washington has the talent to join DeNiro, Grant and Stewart. He doesn't deserve to be lumped in with actors like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler.Ryan Reynolds has made an interesting transformation over the last few years. He used to do a lot of broad comedies, a lot of comedies filled with low brow humor. Then, he made ""The Proposal"" and has been in some action films, transforming his whole persona, trying to become a big-time movie star. His status is certainly on the rise, but the lackluster performance of ""Green Lantern"" and ""The Change-Up"" last summer didn't help. But what the diversity of his films shows is that he can do action, he can do comedy, he can do low brow. He is also a very good-looking guy, which doesn't hurt. People obviously see the potential and believe he will deliver on it.Reynolds does a nice job with Matt. We immediately get who he is; his ambitions, his unfulfilled promise, his boredom. These all paint a very different picture of who he actually is. Than, all of a sudden, everything in his life changes and he will have to use all of the long-dormant skills and lessons, many never used and only learned, to stay alive.""Safe House"" holds a lot of promise, but it has a number of problems creating the equivalent of a wash. It isn't a good thing when your film is reminiscent of Tony Scott's work. When someone mentions Tony Scott, my guess is the first thing you will think of is over-editing. Editing is an art form, used to tell a story, to keep the audience engaged. How is it possible for anyone to get engaged in a story when no shot lasts more than a few seconds? Can you watch a film with a constantly moving hand-held camera? No. These are the tell-tale signs of Scott's work. It almost seems like he uses the over-editing to hide his lack of story telling ability and his lack of creativity. Because he doesn't give us time to concentrate on anything, it is more difficult for most to notice the problems. Espinosa is clearly influenced by Scott. Too bad he didn't look to Ridley, Tony's brother, for inspiration.If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Using that philosophical question lets take a brief look at this suspense film. One of the key factors to a successful suspense film is that it surprises the viewer. If a suspense film doesn't have any surprises, can the audience enjoy it? Very early on, you will be able to guess who is pulling all of the strings behind the scenes. When this becomes evident, the film just becomes a long chase and you will probably be able to guess how that will end. And the little twists and turns are all predictable as well because they have to happen. The filmmakers know they need to keep us guessing, so they throw in these little moments, these little surprises.""Safe House"" is okay. But it promises much more than it delivers. And for that reason, it is truly disappointing.",3,"Denzel is Good, But...",1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,7103,"['Matt', 'Weston', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'CIA', 'Agent', 'eager', 'new', 'assignment',

For that reason, he is usually best paired with someone who is charismatic, but in this film, he's paired with Ryan Reynolds, another intense actor, leading to a very straightforward and inflexible film. Safe House is your typical C.I.A. inspired action film, that features a wanted traitor turning himself in, in order to escape the men he's doubled crossed. The names and places are different, but the story is the same, lots of fighting and corruption, traitors and double agents, it's nothing new. The intensity in Safe House is just off the charts, as there isn't one second of comic relief. The movie starts intense and just continues that way until the end, which really does an injustice to the always strong performance of Washington. The fact of the matter is that this film could have been an interesting one, had Washington and Reynolds had any chemistry whatsoever, but they were basically the same person, on opposite sides of the table. Chemistry in a film like this is really everything, even in a film like Unstoppable, another straight forward and highly predictable film, it was entertaining because of the chemistry between Washington and Chris Pine. All in all, Safe House is an average film, without much of a supporting cast. It's two hours of chases and gun battles, over the same stuff that all these other films are based on.

1465569,AYB0IXBPBJ20A,B005LAIGRS,"Travis Hopson ""shoguntee""","[6, 13]","It's been a long time since there's been reason to be excited over a Denzel Washington movie. Ever since his Oscar win for his heelish turn in Training Day, the actor has mostly been content to coast along in exciting, but not terribly challenging thrillers alongside bland co-stars. It's like someone is constantly trying to find a way to recreate the Training Day magic between Washington and Ethan Hawke. Denzel is always the coolest guy in the room, the one with the confidence and steely reserve that everybody else in the movie lacks. His smile indicates he knows something nobody else does, and there's never really any doubt he'll succeed. That same formula is employed yet again in Safe House, but with an abundance of style thanks to Swedish director, Daniel Espinosa, that makes this an intense thrill ride worth checking out even if feels a touch familiar.Washington's muted co-star this time is Ryan Reynolds, playing bored, untested CIA agent Matt Weston. Matt has pretty much everything he could want: a supremely hot girlfriend who adores him, equally unfair good looks himself, and a cushy position house sitting a safe house in the heart of Cape Town, South Africa. That's not enough for him, though, as he yearns to step out into the field and really earn his stripes.The phrase ""Be careful what you wish for"" comes back to bite Matt in the rear end when ex-CIA agent turned international terrorist Tobin Frost comes waltzing into a nearby embassy and turns himself in. He's got something that has kicked up a violent hornet's nest of activity, with all the world's assassins looking to put a bullet in him and take it. What is it? Doesn't really matter, and the script doesn't seem all that concerned with it, either. The only thing that matters is that Frost can't go anywhere without someone looking to put a knife in his back, and even the CIA safe house he's holed up in is stormed by armed killers.Frost hardly seems phased, even as he's forced to go on the run with a green as grass agent like Weston. Actually, Frost seems to revel in the experience gap, twisting Weston's mind like a pretzel even as he fights for his life, surviving one ridiculous shoot out or car chase after another. Not even the threat of waterboarding seems to phase Frost, as he's more concerned with the type of towel being used on him. His calm, while fun to watch thanks to Denzel's icy charms, is also a little irritating considering the seriousness of the situationThe heavily lauded script by David Guggenheim lacks sufficient twists and witty banter, and you'll see the big swerve coming from a hundred yards away. How it landed on the Black List, Hollywood's annual selections of the best unproduced screenplays, is beyond me. The pace remains at a breakneck speed throughout, but what you want is more of Frost spinning Weston's head like a dreidle. We just don't get nearly enough of it, and too much of the rather weak mystery of a corrupt official within the CIA. What? A corrupt government agent in a spy thriller? Surely you jest. Vera Farmiga and Brendan Gleeson are wasted in this go nowhere subplot, which pans out exactly as you think it does. Ryan Reynolds is just over matched in every conceivable way opposite Denzel. While it's good to see him not playing the wise cracking pretty boy for once, his character is too weak to shine.It's amazing how every Denzel Washington film ends up looking like Tony Scott-lite. Daniel Espinosa, who showed he's a talent to watch after his nervy crime pic, Snabba Cash(known here as Easy Money), initially falls into the same category before settling into a serious groove. His style remains kinetic and and a little crazy at times, but he manages to find moments of calm where Scott can't stay on any scene longer than two seconds. The firefights brutal hand-to-hand brawls have a Bourne Identity feel to them, dizzying and visceral.So it's another solid outing for Denzel, one he can do in his sleep.The film will get your blood pumping, and might even make you laugh once or twice. It just could have been a lot better, with a stronger co-star and better script. Now if only Denzel would leave the safe house his career has been shacked up in and take some risks.",3,"Another solid, unremarkable Denzel Washington thriller",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",2012,4224,"['been', 'long', 'time', 'been', 'reason', 'be', 'excited', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'movie', 'Ever', 'Oscar', 'win', 'heelish', 'turn', 'Training', 'Day', 'actor', 'mostly', 'been', 'content', 'coast', 'along', 'exciting', 'not', 'terribly', 'challenging', 'thrillers', 'alongside', 'bland', 'co-stars', 'someone', 'constantly', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'recreate', 'Training', 'Day', 'magic', 'Washington', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Denzel', 'always', 'coolest', 'guy', 'room', 'one', 'confidence', 'steely', 'reserve', 'everybody', 'else', 'movie', 'smile', 'something', 'nobody', 'else', 'never', 'really', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'succeed', 'same', 'formula', 'employed', 'yet', 'again', 'Safe', 'House', 'abundance', 'style', 'thanks', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'intense', 'thrill', 'ride', 'checking', 'out', 'even', 'feels', 'touch', 'familiar.Washington', 'muted', 'co-star', 'time', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'playing', 'bored', 'untested', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Matt', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'could', 'want', 'supremely', 'hot', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'equally', 'unfair', 'good', 'looks', 'cushy', 'position', 'house', 'sitting', 'safe', 'house', 'heart', 'Cape', 'Town', 'South', 'Africa', 'not', 'enough', 'though', 'step', 'out', 'field', 'really', 'earn', 'stripes.The', 'phrase', 'Be', 'careful', 'what', 'wish', 'back', 'bite', 'Matt', 'rear', 'end', 'when', 'ex-CIA', 'agent', 'turned', 'international', 'terrorist', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'waltzing', 'nearby', 'embassy', 'got', 'something', 'kicked', 'up', 'violent', 'hornet', 'nest', 'activity', 'world', 'assassins', 'looking', 'put', 'bullet', 'take', 'What', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'script', ""n't"", 'seem', 'concerned', 'either', 'only', 'thing', 'matters', 'Frost', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'someone', 'looking', 'put', 'knife', 'back', 'even', 'CIA', 'safe', 'house', 'holed', 'up', 'stormed', 'armed', 'killers.Frost', 'hardly', 'phased', 'even', 'forced', 'go', 'run', 'green', 'grass', 'agent', 'Weston', 'Actually', 'Frost', 'revel', 'experience', 'gap', 'twisting', 'Weston', 'mind', 'pretzel', 'even', 'life', 'surviving', 'one', 'ridiculous', 'shoot', 'car', 'chase', 'Not', 'even', 'threat', 'waterboarding', 'phase', 'Frost', 'more', 'concerned', 'type', 'towel', 'being', 'used', 'calm', 'fun', 'watch', 'thanks', 'Denzel', 'icy', 'charms', 'also', 'little', 'irritating', 'considering', 'seriousness', 'situationThe', 'heavily', 'lauded', 'script', 'David', 'Guggenheim', 'sufficient', 'twists', 'witty', 'banter', ""'ll"", 'see', 'big', 'swerve', 'coming', 'hundred', 'yards', 'away', 'How', 'landed', 'Black', 'List', 'Hollywood', 'annual', 'selections', 'best', 'unproduced', 'screenplays', 'pace', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'what', 'want', 'more', 'Frost', 'spinning', 'Weston', 'head', 'dreidle', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'nearly', 'enough', 'too', 'much', 'rather', 'weak', 'mystery', 'corrupt', 'official', 'CIA', 'What', 'corrupt', 'government', 'agent', 'spy', 'thriller', 'Surely', 'jest', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'Brendan', 'Gleeson', 'are', 'wasted', 'go', 'nowhere', 'subplot', 'out', 'exactly', 'think', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'just', 'matched', 'conceivable', 'way', 'opposite', 'Denzel', 'good', 'see', 'not', 'playing', 'wise', 'cracking', 'pretty', 'boy', 'once', 'character', 'too', 'weak', 'shine.It', 'amazing', 'how', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'film', 'up', 'looking', 'Tony', 'Scott-lite', 'Daniel', 'Espinosa', 'who', 'showed', 'talent', 'watch', 'nervy', 'crime', 'pic', 'Snabba', 'Cash', 'known', 'here', 'Easy', 'Money', 'initially', 'same', 'category', 'settling', 'serious', 'groove', 'style', 'kinetic', 'little', 'crazy', 'times', 'find', 'moments', 'calm', 'where', 'Scott', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stay', 'scene', 'longer', 'two', 'seconds', 'firefights', 'brutal', 'hand-to-hand', 'brawls', 'have', 'Bourne', 'Identity', 'feel', 'dizzying', 'visceral.So', 'solid', 'outing', 'Denzel', 'one', 'can', 'do', 'sleep.The', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'blood', 'pumping', 'might', 'even', 'make', 'laugh', 'once', 'twice', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'stronger', 'co-star', 'better', 'script', 'Now', 'only', 'Denzel', 'would', 'leave', 'safe', 'house', 'career', 'been', 'shacked', 'up', 'take', 'risks']",N/A

Then you hear your significant other is getting a new job nearly 6,000 miles away and begin angling for a transfer but before you can get it you are dropped in a situation unlike any you've ever been in. What do you do?Matt Weston (played by Ryan Reynolds) is the guardian of a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. While he is required to conceal the true nature of his workplace and his employer, once he's entered the office, turned on the lights and locked the door behind him, he's done just about everything he needs to do that day. Meanwhile, the Agency's most wanted fugitive, CIA agent turned traitor Tobin Frost (played by Denzel Washington) has been arrested in a nearby embassy while trying to escape the men who'd already murdered his business contact. Senior management at the Agency is stunned and determined to find out what Frost (Washington) was running from in addition to ascertaining the true extent of the damage he's already done since going rogue more than ten years earlier. However, before Frost cooperates, hostile forces break through the facility's defenses and assassinate Frost's armed escorts. Soon Weston (Reynolds) is on the run with Frost in tow all while trying to keep them both alive and deliver Frost to the intended destination.If you've seen Enemy of the State, Man on Fire, Unstoppable, or Spy Game, you'll no doubt recognize the directing style of Tony Scott in this latest film starring Denzel Washington. The problem being that the director of this film is a man by the name of Daniel Espinosa and while I am a fan of Scott and his films, it shows a considerable lack of imagination on Espinosa's part to direct his films in a near-identical manner. Putting that aside, Washington is exceptional as he often is, Reynolds is surprisingly good and spares us the sarcasm we've come to love and expect from him, and supporting players Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Sheppard make the sub-plot almost as interesting as the main story.

1465571,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B005LAIGRS,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Powerhouse performances from the two leads Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds, as well as the nice photography of South Africa, give ""Safe House"" an edge over other spy action thrillers. The story is too thin; action set-pieces are familiar; and supporting actors including Rub&eacute;n Blades, Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Robert Patrick and Sam Shepard are typecast and rather wasted. But the film's brisk pace and raw energy almost make up for the lack of a more coherent and convincing storyline.Ryan Reynolds is a young CIA agent Matt Weston stationed in South Africa in charge of a ""safe house."" His assignment has been a monotonous and uneventful one until Denzel Washington's Tobin Frost, a former CIA operative gone rogue, is brought to him. When his safe house is under attack from a group of heavily armed men, Matt Weston has to learn quickly how to survive, while running away from the assassins with Tobin Frost.Action sequences include a car chase in the street, shoot-outs and close combats. Because Washington's character is a master of interrogation, he gets into psychological warfare with the young agent, who, when they first meet each other, is obviously no match for Tobin. Also, ""Safe House"" in part looks like a road movie, where a younger and more inexperienced agent learns from the elder and seasoned one. And there is Matt's love interest Ana (Nora Arnezeder), who still does not know the real job of her boyfriend.Thus ""Safe House"" tries to do many things within its 115 minute running time, but it is most effective when focusing the two leading actors.

There is also plenty of character development.  A couple of characters change completely.  There are key moments between Denzel and Ryan Reynolds that are brilliant and this is the best performance I've ever seen Reynolds give.  Good movie.  4 1/2 stars.",5,"""That man is a legend.

1465587,AP3B615GM191G,B005LAIGRS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[12, 20]","I went to see ""Safe House"" in the theater for two reasons: 1. I like psychological thrillers (what this movie was advertised at); and 2. I am a fan of Denzel Washington.  Sadly, the film fails miserably to succeed on #1 and only gives glimpses of #2.For a basic plot summary, ""Safe House"" sees known criminal (and former CIA operative) Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) walk into a U.S. embassy for protection after a secret information-selling deal goes bad.  While the CIA tries to figure out what Frost is really up to, he is broken out of a secure facility by the men pursuing him, with only rookie CIA operative Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) able to ""protect"" him.What needs to be cleared up right away, however, is that ""Safe House"" is NOT the psychological thriller as advertised in the trailer.  Every single ""psych"" moment is shown in the trailer...there is nothing more.  Instead, it is a straight-forward action/adventure romp with plenty of bullets, car crashes, and fisticuffs to satisfy the adrenaline junkies.Where this movie fails miserably, though, is that the plot and direction are an absolute mess from beginning to end.  Though containing all the trappings of an interesting movie, all the wrong aspects are focused on.  What should have (and could have) been a tense psychological thriller instead is one prolonged action scene after another with tiny little ""plot moments"" thrown in between them so that the whole thing doesn't fall apart.About the only redeeming quality of the movie is Denzel.  Though his character is regrettably given very little to do throughout the movie, he still shines as the ""tough guy"" in a number of scenes (again, though, nothing that isn't shown in the trailer).  After taking a break from his ""Man on Fire"" or ""Deju Vu"" type characters, it seemed as if, in ""Safe House"", Denzel was venturing back into that territory once again.Overall, ""Safe House"" will only be enjoyed by those who like having their senses stimulated at the cinema.  It does contain pulse-pounding action, but those looking for any plot or character development will be severely disappointed and should look elsewhere for a Denzel fix.",2,Lacks Plot & Is Not A Psychological Thriller As Advertised,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",2012,2155,"['went', 'see', 'Safe', 'House', 'theater', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'like', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'advertised', '2', 'am', 'fan', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'Sadly', 'film', 'miserably', 'succeed', '1', 'only', 'glimpses', '2.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Safe', 'House', 'known', 'criminal', 'former', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Tobin', 'Frost', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'walk', 'U.S.', 'embassy', 'protection', 'secret', 'information-selling', 'deal', 'bad', 'CIA', 'tries', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'Frost', 'really', 'up', 'broken', 'secure', 'facility', 'men', 'pursuing', 'only', 'rookie', 'CIA', 'operative', 'Matt', 'Weston', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'able', 'protect', 'be', 'cleared', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'however', 'Safe', 'House', 'NOT', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'advertised', 'trailer', 'Every', 'single', 'psych', 'moment', 'shown', 'trailer', 'nothing', 'more', 'Instead', 'straight-forward', 'action/adventure', 'romp', 'plenty', 'bullets', 'car', 'crashes', 'fisticuffs', 'satisfy', 'adrenaline', 'junkies.Where', 'movie', 'miserably', 'plot', 'direction', 'are', 'absolute', 'mess', 'beginning', 'end', 'containing', 'trappings', 'interesting', 'movie', 'wrong', 'aspects', 'are', 'focused', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tense', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'instead', 'one', 'prolonged', 'action', 'scene', 'tiny', 'little', 'plot', 'moments', 'thrown', 'so', 'whole', 'thing', ""n't"", 'fall', 'apart.About', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'movie', 'Denzel', 'character', 'regrettably', 'given', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'movie', 'still', 'tough', 'guy', 'number', 'scenes', 'again', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'shown', 'trailer', 'taking', 'break', 'Man', 'Fire', 'Deju', 'Vu', 'type', 'characters', 'seemed', 'Safe', 'House', 'Denzel', 'was', 'venturing', 'back', 'territory', 'once', 'again.Overall', 'Safe', 'House', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'who', 'like', 'having', 'senses', 'stimulated', 'cinema', 'contain', 'pulse-pounding', 'action', 'looking', 'plot', 'character', 'development', 'will', 'be', 'severely', 'disappointed', 'should', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Denzel', 'fix']",N/A
