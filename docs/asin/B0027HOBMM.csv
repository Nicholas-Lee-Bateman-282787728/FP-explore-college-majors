1254208,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,B0027HOBMM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I picked this up because it looked interesting, Dennis Quaid is a really good actor, and Zhang Ziyi was in it.  The movie seemed pretty interesting and enjoyable for the first half, even though it was obviously something of a ""Se7en"" copycat.  I was surprised by the turn involving Zhang Ziyi's character, which was good, since a suspense movie is usually improved when the story has some surprises in store for you.  Alas, from that turn, the movie started to go downhill.  It was painfully predictable from that point on.  (Read no further if don't want spoilers.)  I knew just as soon as they set Detective Breslin's (Dennis Quaid's) oldest son Alex up as a very bright, but unmotivated student, and made a point (over and over again) of the fact that Breslin's work keeps him from spending much time with his boys, that the oldest kid was going to be the ringleader of the four murderers who call themselves ""The Four Horsemen.""  At the end, we're obviously supposed to be torn up at the heart-wrenching conclusion, when Breslin discover's what his son has done, and his son suicides in front of him to confront him with his failure as a father.  I had almost the opposite reaction.  My first thought was ""have we really become so self-indulgent as culture, that we are supposed to feel sympathy with someone who commits multiple, horrific torture-murders because his daddy didn't pay him enough attention?!?  Are you kidding me!?""Another problem is that this whole thing just doesn't feel true.  Breslin's son really isn't all that believable as a serial killer, given his character background.  Perhaps it's just because, thanks to my work, I know too much about them and their usual characteristics.  John Doe, in ""Se7en"" was a believable serial killer, because he was given several characteristics of a psychopath -- which almost all serial killers are, and which is defined as someone who lacks empathy and guilt, who is egocentric and impulsive, who can often convincingly fake the human emotions he lacks, and who does not conform to social norms, conventional morality and society's laws.  John Doe was also a classic ""mission-oriented"" serial killer (as opposed to a lust killer whose crimes sexually gratify him; a hedonistic serial killer, who derives pleasure from killing; or a ""visionary"" serial killer, who suffers psychotic breaks with reality, and acts out of his delusions).  Breslin's son is obviously meant to be a mission oriented serial killer like John Doe was, but again, his history doesn't fit, and his obvious care for his younger brother isn't consistent with a real serial killer's psychopathic personality.  Also, almost all serial killers underwent some form of actual abuse, whether physical, sexual, or psychological/emotional as a children, which doesn't apply to Alex either.  In fact, nothing in this kid's past is really characteristic of a serial killer.  The only character in the film who does have typical serial killer factors in her past is Zhang Ziyi's, but her behavior is more characteristic of male serial killers than the female ones (who almost always have a different MO).Anyway, this is a movie that started out well, but once it became clear where they were going with it, it quickly lost steam and became just another mediocre copycat picture.",2,"Decent movie for the first half, but then...",1255564800,"10 15, 2009",2009,3300,"['picked', 'up', 'looked', 'interesting', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'really', 'good', 'actor', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'was', 'movie', 'seemed', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'enjoyable', 'first', 'half', 'even', 'was', 'obviously', 'something', 'Se7en', 'copycat', 'was', 'surprised', 'turn', 'involving', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'character', 'was', 'good', 'suspense', 'movie', 'usually', 'improved', 'when', 'story', 'surprises', 'store', 'Alas', 'turn', 'movie', 'started', 'go', 'downhill', 'was', 'painfully', 'predictable', 'point', 'Read', 'further', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers', 'knew', 'just', 'as', 'soon', 'set', 'Detective', 'Breslin', 'Dennis', 'Quaid', 'oldest', 'son', 'Alex', 'up', 'very', 'bright', 'unmotivated', 'student', 'made', 'point', 'over', 'again', 'fact', 'Breslin', 'work', 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'boys', 'oldest', 'kid', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'ringleader', 'four', 'murderers', 'who', 'call', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'end', ""'re"", 'obviously', 'supposed', 'be', 'torn', 'up', 'heart-wrenching', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Breslin', 'discover', 'what', 'son', 'done', 'son', 'suicides', 'front', 'confront', 'failure', 'father', 'had', 'almost', 'opposite', 'reaction', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'have', 'really', 'become', 'so', 'self-indulgent', 'culture', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'someone', 'who', 'multiple', 'horrific', 'torture-murders', 'daddy', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'enough', 'attention', 'Are', 'kidding', 'problem', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', ""n't"", 'feel', 'true', 'Breslin', 'son', 'really', ""n't"", 'that', 'believable', 'serial', 'killer', 'given', 'character', 'background', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'thanks', 'work', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'usual', 'characteristics', 'John', 'Doe', 'Se7en', 'was', 'believable', 'serial', 'killer', 'was', 'given', 'several', 'characteristics', 'psychopath', 'almost', 'serial', 'killers', 'are', 'defined', 'someone', 'who', 'empathy', 'guilt', 'who', 'egocentric', 'impulsive', 'who', 'can', 'often', 'convincingly', 'fake', 'human', 'emotions', 'who', 'not', 'conform', 'social', 'norms', 'conventional', 'morality', 'society', 'laws', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'also', 'classic', 'mission-oriented', 'serial', 'killer', 'opposed', 'lust', 'killer', 'crimes', 'sexually', 'gratify', 'hedonistic', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'pleasure', 'killing', 'visionary', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'psychotic', 'breaks', 'reality', 'delusions', 'Breslin', 'son', 'obviously', 'meant', 'be', 'mission', 'oriented', 'serial', 'killer', 'John', 'Doe', 'was', 'again', 'history', ""n't"", 'fit', 'obvious', 'care', 'younger', 'brother', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'real', 'serial', 'killer', 'psychopathic', 'personality', 'Also', 'almost', 'serial', 'killers', 'underwent', 'form', 'actual', 'abuse', 'physical', 'sexual', 'psychological/emotional', 'children', ""n't"", 'apply', 'Alex', 'either', 'fact', 'nothing', 'kid', 'past', 'really', 'characteristic', 'serial', 'killer', 'only', 'character', 'film', 'who', 'have', 'typical', 'serial', 'killer', 'factors', 'past', 'Zhang', 'Ziyi', 'behavior', 'more', 'characteristic', 'male', 'serial', 'killers', 'female', 'ones', 'who', 'almost', 'always', 'have', 'different', 'MO', '.Anyway', 'movie', 'started', 'out', 'well', 'once', 'became', 'clear', 'where', 'were', 'going', 'quickly', 'lost', 'steam', 'became', 'just', 'mediocre', 'copycat', 'picture']",Horsemen
1254209,A2D7B5I7ZQ51XL,B0027HOBMM,Anthony Pittore,"[31, 37]","Dennis Quaid stars as a widowed detective facing an investigation the likes of which he has never seen: Four murders modeled after the themes of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha) also stars.The first thing that comes to mind when hearing about a crime thriller about a detective investigation religious-themed murders will be the comparison to the modern classic 'Se7en' (David Fincher, 1995). And, yes, it's quite obvious that 'The Horsemen' had quite a bit of inspiration from that film, and the film was styled after its predecessor in more ways than the story. But, I must ask. . . is anyone surprised? Keep in mind that this film was produced by Platinum Dunes, Michael Bay's remake machine that has given us the remakes of such classic horrors as 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and 'Friday the 13th.' Maybe Bay wanted to remake 'Se7en' a mere fourteen years after its release, but couldn't get the rights. . . so, they went for a film styled after it.Regardless, the film itself (separated from 'Se7en' and other similar films) isn't terrible. While it CERTAINLY doesn't live up to the 7.5/10 IMDb currently rates it at (a number clearly inflated by crew and studio employees), it still works as an interesting crime thriller. The story is good, Quaid is his usual dependable self, and the direction captures some darkly attractive scenery. Also, the last 20 or so minutes give quite a few thrills and almost had me on the edge of my seat. However, on the negative side, the script is quite lacking and maintains too steady of a course, feeling more like a collection of scenes than a coherent film; Ziyi Zhang puts forth one of the most annoying performances I've seen in a long time; and the extremely rushed and thoughtless final moments leave a very bitter taste in the audience's collective mind.Similar to the Al Pacino vehicle '88 Minutes' (2008), 'The Horsemen' simply came along too late for its audience (not to mention had a below-average script) to be as enjoyable as it could've been.Final Verdict: 6/10.-AP3-",3,"""Pales"" in comparison to 'Se7en,' but still keeps the viewer's attention",1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,2064,"['Dennis', 'Quaid', 'widowed', 'detective', 'facing', 'investigation', 'likes', 'never', 'seen', 'Four', 'murders', 'modeled', 'themes', 'Four', 'Horsemen', 'Apocalypse', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'Memoirs', 'Geisha', 'also', 'stars.The', 'first', 'thing', 'mind', 'when', 'hearing', 'crime', 'thriller', 'detective', 'investigation', 'religious-themed', 'murders', 'will', 'be', 'comparison', 'modern', 'classic', ""'Se7en"", 'David', 'Fincher', '1995', 'yes', 'quite', 'obvious', 'Horsemen', 'had', 'quite', 'bit', 'inspiration', 'film', 'film', 'was', 'styled', 'predecessor', 'more', 'ways', 'story', 'must', 'ask', 'anyone', 'surprised', 'Keep', 'mind', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'Platinum', 'Dunes', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'remake', 'machine', 'given', 'remakes', 'such', 'classic', 'horrors', ""'The"", 'Texas', 'Chain', 'Saw', 'Massacre', '13th', 'Maybe', 'Bay', 'wanted', 'remake', ""'Se7en"", 'mere', 'fourteen', 'years', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'rights', 'so', 'went', 'film', 'styled', 'it.Regardless', 'film', 'separated', ""'Se7en"", 'other', 'similar', 'films', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'CERTAINLY', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', '7.5/10', 'IMDb', 'currently', 'rates', 'number', 'clearly', 'inflated', 'crew', 'studio', 'employees', 'still', 'interesting', 'crime', 'thriller', 'story', 'good', 'Quaid', 'usual', 'dependable', 'self', 'direction', 'darkly', 'attractive', 'scenery', 'Also', 'last', '20', 'so', 'minutes', 'give', 'quite', 'few', 'thrills', 'almost', 'had', 'edge', 'seat', 'However', 'negative', 'side', 'script', 'quite', 'lacking', 'too', 'steady', 'course', 'feeling', 'more', 'collection', 'scenes', 'coherent', 'film', 'Ziyi', 'Zhang', 'forth', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'extremely', 'rushed', 'thoughtless', 'final', 'moments', 'leave', 'very', 'bitter', 'taste', 'audience', 'collective', 'mind.Similar', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'vehicle', 'Minutes', '2008', 'Horsemen', 'simply', 'came', 'along', 'too', 'late', 'audience', 'not', 'mention', 'had', 'below-average', 'script', 'be', 'as', 'enjoyable', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been.Final', 'Verdict', '6/10.-AP3-']",Horsemen

The resulting single-father status and responsibility of two growing boys and weight of the loss of his wife seems too much for him to take.

Similar to movies like ""Se7en"", the killers in ""Horsemen"" use the bible as a motive for their diabolical actions.  However, unlike ""Se7en"", this movie's plot isn't very coherent, the sets aren't believable and the characters don't seem to mesh as well.  Plus, come on guys (Dennis Quaid and Clifton Collins, Jr), what's up with the hair?  This is the new millenium, not the 1970's.  Get a cut, would ya?Additionally, Ziyi Zhang's character isn't very believable.  Hannibal Lecter she ain't.  I don't necessarily think it's bad acting, just a bad script.  If you want to see Ms Zhang in a (much) better role, check out ""The Road Home""--unlike ""Horsemen"", it's a 5-star movie that you CAN'T buy used for a penny from over 100 different sellers; a lot simpler, but a lot better.

I watched it intently, however, for 3 reasons: Zhang Ziyi (in an English language role), Dennis Quaid and the visuals by two Swedes, Jonas kerlund (director) and Eric Broms (DP). If it weren't for them, this film would have gotten 2 stars from me.Dennis has gotten beefier and more eccentric -- and also more effortlessly magnetic. He was in every scene as the relentless detective with family issues -- and, as an actor, he never flagged. So it was quite an accomplishment for Zhang Ziyi, in a much smaller role, to share a few scenes with him and still be memorable.The rewriting to accommodate her casting was sloppy (primarily, she's too old for the role as written). But that was the fault of the writers. She did wonders with what was given her. And she's sexier in this role than in any other role I've seen her in -- and she spends most of her time heavily covered up.Ultimately, a disappointing story -- but much of the journey kept promising something better.

From reading other reviews, I notice that a few plot holes are the main theme of why the movie isn't so great.  But I'm here to help explain them.  Being one that I tend to understand movies like this, the ideaology of the movie is that, within each person who were the horsemen- they felt inside.Kristin who was war; was at war with herself, inside because here she is a beautiful young girl and her adopted father molested and probably raped her.  So, all the while thinks, okay... I was adopted and love by this family up to a certain point and then ripped apart.  I'm the same way, I've experienced this myself, it's why I know- because I'm at war with myself too at time.Then there was Garrison Jacobs; who was Pestilence, we find out from Kristin in her jail cell that Garrison was heartbroken and a liar and that he claimed the teacher molested his son, when it wasn't true.  But you know what, that's what Pestilence is, spreading diseased excuses or lies because technically- pestilence means plague.  But because of who and what he was, it killed him from his own.As for Corey Kuth, he was dead inside because of his brother not accepting him for who he was.  It literally destroyed what he believed in and made his dead from the world.  Therefore, he was death and as he put it when he stabbed the man who tried to rob him, ""Hell follows me"" and in a way, he was the cause of that by letting it get to him so badly.  So he put an end to it by killing himself in front of his brother- to make his brother see that hell follows with his death.Then there is Alex Breslin, who is conquest, he's the conquering hero, the white horse, the leader of the pact.  He found these three people from his group therapy and put together a website called, ""We are the Nothing"" because to them, they feel like they are ""nothing"" and that no one understands them.  That's the plot line of the movie, no one understands them and they punish those who wronged them and video tape it so that when Alex sacrifices himself as the fourth victim, the apocolypse will happen.  The veil will be lifted, their videos will be shown and everyone will realize that these four kids were capable of killing others because those others knew how basically kill these kids inside.  The loss of Alex's mother and then his father not being apart of his life, what do parents expect?  They're kids to be happy and well-grounded, kids feel and this is why they did what they did.  They hurt and they hurt the people who hurt them.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[3, 3]","After a number of re-shoots and spending a good amount of time on the shelf, Horsemen finally sees the light of day as it gets released straight to DVD.  Dennis Quaid stars as a forensic specialist who is assigned to a case involving a string of murders in which the victims are suspended from hooks, and the words ""Come and see"" are found at the scene.  It isn't long before he figures out that the murders are linked to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and what develops is a sloppily put together, pure rip-off of Seven.  Directed by famed music video helmer Jonas kerlund, Horsemen provides plenty of doom and gloom atmosphere to go along with a stale performance from Quaid, with the biggest disappointment being the performance of Ziyi Zhang, who comes off as being more annoying than anything else.  Clifton Collins Jr (in a terrible wig), Patrick Fugit, Lou Taylor Pucci, and Eric Balfour are also along for the ride as well; which just never seems to really kick into high gear.  The twist ending is easily seen coming as well if you pay careful attention; all of which amounts to Horsemen being a boatload of wasted potential.

1254234,A14GUG0O427F5U,B0027HOBMM,Nikki,"[0, 1]","This movie was trying to be two movies, 'Se7en' and 'The Flock'.  Both movies deal with murders done by people of less-than-moral standings.  'Horsemen' takes the religious murders from 'Se7en' and the antagonists from a more ill-understood parts of society (such as the body-mod community) that was seen in 'The Flock' and tries to squish them together.As you can probably read in the synopsis the main protagonist, Dennis Quad, is a police officer that gets a call about a series of grisly murders that seem to follow a pattern.  Also throughout the movie is a sorta sub-plot about his lack-luster parenting skills as he tries to connect with his sons since their mother's death.The basic plot isn't anything we haven't seen before.  The presentation however is something else.  The murders are portrayed in a very graphic horror/torture way, with bodies being hung and drained of blood sometimes.  I thought that the balance of the whole thing was slightly off.  The story with Aidan (or really Dennis Quad cause I couldn't really distinguish him as an actor from his character) and his kids doesn't really do the job of adding a 'middle-man innocence'.  'The Flock' and 'Se7en' both had characters and scenes that were completely removed from the main plot, which added a sense of normalcy that is absent in 'Horsemen'.My biggest gripe with the movie is that element seen from 'The Flock', where the antagonists come from a little-understood part of society.  Tattoo shops and body-suspension were put in a very very poor light.  The actual act of voluntary suspension is not about torture but a form of mediation.  I wouldn't expect the general public to understand it (actually had an argument with my dad about trying to explain how suspension and other activities from the body-mod community aren't 'just about mutilation'), but a little knowledge and open-mindedness can stop people from assuming every tattoo wearer is out to slice their throat.  However when people from these communities are used as the fall-back villain than how can the general public display any acceptance of their practices?Anyway to finish the review: there is nothing spectacular about 'Horsemen'.  The horror comes out too gritty and too intense from the beginning with nothing to really balance it and kinda dies out towards the end which can be seen from a mile away.  I only sorta enjoyed it (I really liked Ziyi Zhang's character a lot), but it was just way too close to 'Se7en' and 'The Flock' to have any really shining qualities.

The premise of the movie, i.e. the four horsemen of the apocalypse being used as a motivation for murder, was intriguing, but ultimately it was frustrating and disappointing because the storyline was too incoherent. There was just too much of this movie that didn't make sense, and you're kind of left scratching your head. I agree with other reviewers about the graphic violence, too... it was very, very disturbing, with many scenes involving bodies suspended by large rigs using fish hooks. So this movie is not for the squeamish and certainly should not be seen by young children. Perhaps many or most modern viewers have become accustomed to seeing such graphic bloody images and it doesn't faze them. But if so, is that a good thing? It's very sad in my opinion.The best part of the movie was the storyline involving Dennis Quaid as the emotionally distant father and the way he and his kids deal with the loss of their wife/mother.

And yet this, produced by Michael Bay no less, as far as I can tell went to a few festivals, played for a couple of weeks in five American cities, and then got dumped straight to DVD. What? And the premise was pretty darned cool, a kind of Seven ripoff based on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rather than the seven deadly sins. I'm all for Seven ripoffs if they're quality, so I knew I had to go rent a copy and check it out. And now I understand completely why it achieved instant obscurity. The Horsemen is, of the 25-30 I've seen so far, the worst movie of 2009.Quaid plays Aidan Breslin, a detective with a background in orthodontics who gets assigned to a case after a cache of extracted, bloody teeth is found in the woods. The first body is found soon after, the wife of a prominent businessman (Peter Stormare) who has a number of adopted children. One of those, Kirsten (Zhang), has just turned eighteen and seems attracted to the recently-widowed Breslin. He, however, has his own problems dealing with both the death of his wife and the resentment of his older son (Southland Tales' Lou Taylor Pucci). Breslin is convinced that the murderers (for there must be four) have taken the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as their motif, and the case becomes a race against time--can they find the killers before they find themselves with more victims? Things get weird when one of the murders chooses to step into the light--and it's the last person Breslin would have suspected...There was a great deal of potential here, but every time it reared its ugly head, it was soundly beaten down either by the pedestrian direction, the woeful miscasting (Ziyi Zhang's performance has been talked to death, no reason for me to do more than mention it here), or the script, which managed to get the big plot twists right, but lacks everything else. Breslin's actions are in many ways affected by the death of his wife, but other than being pulled out for a row with the kid and mentioned in order to set it up, we don't get any real sense of the thing. For that matter, we don't get much of that about anyone; we get told about the affectations of certain characters, but we never get a sense of those as actual pieces of their personalities. They're nothing but plot points.Much worse than it would have been had it not contained the possibility of a good movie. Avoid like the plague.

1254243,A387BD735MI50R,B0027HOBMM,R. Schultz,"[2, 3]","We have another fantastical series of murders here. This time, victims are suspended from hooks and left to ""bleed out"" as they hang, enmeshed in their rigging. These murders are linked to the destructive onslaught of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. There are a couple of things wrong with this invocation of the Book of Revelation.First, the suspense/murder mystery genre is really showing the strain with this new entry in the field. It underscores how we are entering a sort of era of Roman decline in which ever more shocking, grisly horrors must be presented in order to keep us entertained and register any sensation at all. A tidy, tuxedoed body in the library won't do any more. As the creators of the CSI series and films such as this seem to think - murders must now be graphic, gruesome, and elaborately taunting and inventive if they are to have any hope of capturing our attention. However this escalation has lead to film murders that no human murderer could hope to accomplish - such as here and in last year's movie ""Anamorph."" Such films, congratulating themselves on their brutal realism, actually start as impossible absurdities.To be fair though, Jonas Akerlund, the Director of ""Horsemen,"" does point out in the Director's Commentary that there is a fairly large and growing subculture of people who practice hook ""suspension"" for the altered state of consciousness such painful dangling brings. He says he explored this subculture in the process of doing research for the movie, but stopped just short of trying the procedure himself. So there is some fact behind the fiction of these murders.The other problem with the film's premise though is that the Four Horsemen aren't really necessary to explain means or motive. The Biblical reference is just a muddying overlay. It seems a last ditch effort to ramp up the shock value. Akerlund, again in the bonus Commentary, said that some of the Asian editions of the DVD had jackets showing the lead actors on horseback. The Asian cover designers had apparently taken the title ""Horsemen"" literally rather than as a Biblical allusion. But actually, the actors might just as well have been on horseback. A Wild West backdrop for the crimes would have been just as relevant (or irrelevant) as the Biblical one lowered here.However, behind all the gory bizarre, this movie makes some interesting points, and includes some arresting performances. Lou Taylor Pucci is very good as the detective's son, and Ziyi Zhang does a fascinating turn as the eldest daughter of the first victim.

O'Blenis,"[0, 2]","A psychological horror thriller, Horsemen follows detective Aidan Breslin (Dennis Quaid) and other officers on the Detroit police force as they investigate a series of connected brutal murders in which the victims have been tortured to death and the words 'Come And See' are left at the scenes, both goading investigators on and hinting at something bigger yet to come.  Breslin, already dark and distant since the death of his wife several years earlier, is drawn into obsession on the case and further away from his increasingly estranged children at home.  It's eventually deciphered that the 'Come And See' warning and certain other clues left at the crime scenes tie in with Biblical references to the coming of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  Things get weirder as suspects for the killings start emerging - not the people the police thought would be involved with acts this horrific, and as very disturbing facts about the pasts of some of the victims get called into question.  Horsemen takes a different route thanSaw - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)and other recent horror movies with a torture theme: most (though not all) of the grisliest acts take place largely offscreen, seen in glimpses or in the still shots of crime scene photos, and in the reactions of the characters who come upon the crime scenes, who view video footage that turns up, etc.  It fits in well with the air of mystery the movie builds as to who the real killers are, what the ultimate agenda is, and all the other facets of the film that stay largely in the dark until the end.  There are major surprise revelations throughout - not just at the end - and the ultimate revelations at the end are dramatic and jolting.  With the secrets Horsemen has set itself up to reveal, there are so many ways this movie could have fallen on its face, but it avoids every one of them.

1254249,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0027HOBMM,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","Sometimes the production history behind a film is more interesting than the film itself (like, say, ""Town and Country""). Even if you don't know ""Horsemen,"" directed by Jonas kerlund, (""Spun"") went through re-shoots and re-edits, you will know something is wrong with the thriller that has only 90 minutes. Several parts are never explained (and not in the way that will make the film intriguing). The film opens promisingly, but soon loses its way and the wrap-up is terribly rushed. In short, the story of ""Horsemen"" doesn't make much sense.Dennis Quaid plays a Detroit police detective Aidan Breslin, whose beloved wife died recently. The hardened detective has to investigate a string of grisly ritualistic serial murders, and he discovers Kristin (Ziyi Zhang), a beautiful daughter of one victim, knows the truths behind the cases.The film's effective photography captures the cold, chilling atmosphere that perfectly matches the story, and Ziyi Zhang's rather campy acting is kind of attractive, but the storyline remains weak and unfocused throughout, not strong enough to attract the viewers. Cryptic messages left at the crime scenes are not really interesting, neither are the film's biblical references. Dennis Quaid's police detective actually has little to do while investigating. Reliable and talented actors like Clifton Collins Jr. are wasted, or just forgotten.There are some moments in ""Horsemen,"" where the incredible story shows a sign of improvement as a thriller or a drama.

1254251,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B0027HOBMM,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[3, 3]","I have a definite fondness for psychological thrillers; they have the terrific potential to engage its audience, to serve up suspense and send the audience into one mind-boggling ride. In the tradition of ""Seven"" and ""Resurrection"", ""HORSEMEN"" is another suspense thriller that captures themes of religious and Biblical significance that mixes in some mild elements from ""Saw"" and ""Antibodies"". Directed by Jonas Akerlund and co-produced by Michael Bay, the film is a composition of a very grim narrative that gets its strength from probable misery.Aidan Breslin (Dennis Quaid) is a cop reeling from the death of his wife some years ago; trying to keep everything together with his two sons, Sean and Alex (Liam James and Lou Taylor Pucci respectively). Life isn't already easy for a single dad who happens to be assigned to a new serial killer case that targets the city with the promise of Biblical apocalypse. When a demented killer gives herself up, (played by Ziyi Zhang) a young woman  named Kristin who is supposedly a victim of sexual abuse. She apparently holds the codes to further acts of murder that somehow involves the fetish action of suspension. Aidan relentlessly works to make sense of the clues, as Kristin is not the only psychopath on the loose, but three others who have the ambition to name themselves after the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.The film has tremendous potential and the direction definitely knows that it does have an ambitious theme. Akerlund does manage to engage me in the film's first 40 minutes as it generates an eerie atmosphere, some freaky images and a feeling of dread that captures a strong sensation of despair that something bad is going to happen and that it is only going to get worse. The script combines certain CSI-like aesthetics and good cinematography that manipulates the senses to expect something truly shocking and unnerving. The film's promise is there, and quite frankly it left me anticipating what would come next. After all, a prophetic killer holds such a large promise that it may at least be twisted as ""Resurrection"".Well, after we become privy to a dead fetus, the film goes downhill. The film just loses its momentum, it started to lack any feeling of suspense and doesn't even give a decent scare. The plot becomes a bit convoluted as the film's central plot slowly begins to unveil. The Biblical theme begins to get lost in its narrative, that the ambition becomes a muddled and quite frankly too predictable. Instead we begin to see a father-son relationship take center stage, and whatever creepiness it may have attained become muddied by too much teenage angst. Alright, I can forgive a bit of a subtle subplot here and there, as long as it helps its theme come full circle, which becomes the main issue with the script--it stops short.The writing does seem to be in the right spot, but writer David Callaham takes the biblical tone to acts of sadism, that creeps around to pack some gross-out spots to attain some shock value. The killings are intense, the self-mutilation scenes can be a bit gory (thank goodness there's no CGI) but it does nothing to advance its biblical tone. Unlike ""Seven"" the way the gore and blood are set up doesn't fit its religious overtone that it becomes very insignificant. After awhile, it all becomes like a cheap way to surprise its audience; the writing felt a little confused, and it loses focus on everything else. The film also tries to generate a similar ""Clarice and Lecter"" feel to the Aidan and Kristin relationship but it never becomes compelling. ""Horsemen"" reaches a cinematic digression that it never recovers from, as the script becomes more and more unfocused.The acting is decent for the most part. Quaid had his moments, and I do know that the man can act. Well, I guess he did nicely in his portrayal as a cop-father who is trying to keep things together. Ziyi Zhang may be a little miscast but she made do with what she had. Zhang is one very charismatic lady and it was quite refreshing to see her broaden her horizons in acting. She is sexy, seductive, and maybe even a bit creepy in her portrayal as the adopted daughter who gets sexually abused. (Sorry, the sex scenes are only hinted at, but there is Polaroid shot of a possible sighting of a nude Ziyi Zhang)I suppose ""Horsemen"" had the ambition to try to depart the usual serial killer mechanics but unfortunately, it misses its mark. Experienced movie fans will undoubtedly see the twist coming from a mile away. I do not want to spoil the film, but suffice it to say, the film blends elements from ""Seven"" and ""Resurrection"" with some ""Silence of the Lambs"" together with some ""Antibodies""-like twist and turns. It feels like parts of other successful psychological thrillers that make up its whole; with the message of an angry generation making up its focal point. The climax is just too underwhelming and quite ridiculous. While the heart may be in the right place, the film's execution is just a whole lot of uneven misfires.Rent it [2 Stars]",2,SO Much Wasted Potential....,1248307200,"07 23, 2009",2009,5038,"['have',

The idea of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse being brought back to ""life"" by some sadistic killers, held some appeal as I wanted to see how this premise was going to play out. The result was utterly disappointing, and what really annoyed me was the last 10-15 minutes of the movie which just seemed altogether preachy and predictable.The movie centers around a police detective who is also a specialist, a forensic odontologist [did i get that right?], Aidan Breslin, played by Dennis Quaid. He is a widower who is so overcome by grief over the loss of his wife, that he neglects his two sons, the older one Alex played by Lou Taylor Pucci. He gets embroiled in a series of murder investigations, accompanied by his partner Stingray [Clifton Collins Jr, in a totally insignificant role] which has the victims strung up in suspension devices [their limbs supported or rather suspended from said device with large fish hooks], and with the cryptic words ""Come and See"" written on the walls, on the trees etc. One such case, where a suburban mother is killed, has Breslin coming into contact with the victim's adopted Asian daughter, Kristen [Chinese import Zhang Ziyi of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""] who smiles in a sinister fashion at the initially clueless Breslin.As time goes by, Breslin figures out that the phrase ""Come and See"" is in the Book of Revelation, and references the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, i.e. Conquest, War, Famine, and Death. Intriguing premise right? Unfortunately, this interesting plot premise never gets fully explained. The plot takes strange twists and turns, sinking viewers into a quicksand of incoherency and abominable acting - especially by Zhang Ziyi, who never convinces for one moment that she is actually capable of the things she claims to have done, in fact her acting is atrocious, not only because of her poor command of the English language and the resulting inappropriate enunciations and facial expressions, but also her whole demeanor is just plain annoying. Dennis Quaid's performance is average, and I couldn't help but wonder why he took this role. The supporting cast is also quite ho-hum, and there was not one single stand out performance to salvage this mess of a movie. I'd rather watch reruns of the series ""Milennium"".
