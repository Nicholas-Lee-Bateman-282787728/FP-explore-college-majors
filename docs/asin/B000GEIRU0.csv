1002524,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000GEIRU0,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[5, 9]","Some people have absolutely no shame.  The makers of ""Are You Scared?"" watched as the Saw horror series brought in growing legions of fans and, in a desperate bid to leech off of that popularity, crafted this stinker.  They didn't even try to hide it.The movie is about a group of teens who wake up in a warehouse and are told via hidden speakers that they are the newest contestants on a reality television show called ""Are You Scared?""  They must each pass a series of gruesome ""games"" designed to test their fears.  At best, these ""games"" are eye-rolling attempts at creativity; at worst, they are lifted directly from the Saw movies (one fellow has a key surgically implanted in his body; he must cut it out of his own skin in order to stop a bomb that might blow him up; this comes straight out of ""Saw II"").Whereas the Saw movies have a shred of credibilty (if nothing else, you can point to their originality), this movie has absolutely nothing going for it.  The characters are either stereotypes or (even worse) bare outlines of people, and it doesn't help that they are poorly acted.  The dialogue is hammy, the cinematography is pedestrian, and the story is (to put it mildly) aggressively boring.  The film tries to up the ante near the end by throwing in a few twists (again, a la ""Saw""), but they are so glaringly stupid and forced that the most those twists will elicit are laughs.

1002525,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000GEIRU0,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[0, 0]","Are You Scaredis basically a cheap rip-off ofSaw, except without the interesting plot twists or good writing. The angle here is that all the *games* staged by the villain are supposedly being filmed for a reality TV competition.  Like most things on reality TV, everything here is set up to make the participants into losers.  While low budget horror movies can often be better than mainstream horror, this is a movie that isn't.Mostly young unknown actors are cast here, some of which may be the stars of tomorrow and others that might simply be incredibly miscast.  In a few cases, they seem to be talented, but the problem is that the lines and characters they are given are almost impossible to take seriously.What's worse, it seems like these actors were either given no direction or misdirection.  The lead actress who plays Kelly, Alethea Kutscher, seems to make the most out of what she is given.  Her part is written and executed well enough to earn this movie an extra star towards the end, but not enough to save it completely.Like Saw, the movie shows us the killer as he traps his prey inside his game, as well as law enforcement as they try to figure out where he will strike next.  Of course, they are always one step behind. Yet while movies like Saw and Seven had some depth written into the dialogue of law enforcement, here those character's lines seem to be contrived as well as silly.From a technical perspective, even with a limited budget it appears like they had true professionals doing the camera work and photography.  Similarly, even though the obvious low budget gives many of the props a chintzy feel, they seem to have done a passable job all things considered.  However few horror fans will appreciate those details in a movie that is, frankly, neither scary nor very entertaining.About 1000 more takes and this would have been at least an entertaining low-budget horror movie.  As it stands, at it's best this movie is unintentionally funny and at it's worst it's just plain boring.There is a plot-twist at the end, which is almost not worth spoiling, but I will leave it for you to judge for yourself.  Suffice it to say that it seems like more of a gimmick than anything to really surprise you.This is typical D or F horror fare.  There's a lot of screaming, running through dark corridors, and flickering light bulbs.  But none of it is enough to even allow this movie to rise to the level of average.  And just when you think the movie is improving a little, it ends with a scene that can only be described as silly.Some have implied that this is one of those horror movies that is ""so bad it's good.""  I beg to differ.  This will only make you laugh with friends if you are not really paying attention to it.  If you want to watch a spoof horror movie to make you laugh, watchHatchet (Unrated Director's Cut).  Even with it's faults, it's 10 times funnier than this.If you are looking for mindless horror entertainment, this might not even satisfy those that are easy to please.  Only those who are as obsessed as I am with watching every single horror movie to come out need rent this one.  For everybody else, save yourself an hour and a half of your life and avoid this one.Avoid.",2,"Are You Scared? - Disappointing Saw Knock-Off, Hardlly Bad Enough To Laugh At",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,3221,"['Are', 'Scaredis', 'basically', 'cheap', 'rip-off', 'ofSaw', 'interesting', 'plot', 'twists', 'good', 'writing', 'angle', 'here', '*games*', 'staged', 'villain', 'are', 'supposedly', 'being', 'filmed', 'reality', 'TV', 'competition', 'most', 'things', 'reality', 'TV', 'everything', 'here', 'set', 'up', 'make', 'participants', 'losers', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'can', 'often', 'be', 'better', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'movie', ""isn't.Mostly"", 'young', 'unknown', 'actors', 'are', 'cast', 'here', 'may', 'be', 'stars', 'tomorrow', 'others', 'might', 'simply', 'be', 'incredibly', 'miscast', 'few', 'cases', 'seem', 'be', 'talented', 'problem', 'lines', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'are', 'almost', 'impossible', 'take', 'seriously.What', 'worse', 'actors', 'were', 'either', 'given', 'direction', 'misdirection', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'Kelly', 'Alethea', 'Kutscher', 'make', 'most', 'what', 'given', 'part', 'written', 'executed', 'well', 'enough', 'earn', 'movie', 'extra', 'star', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'save', 'completely.Like', 'Saw', 'movie', 'killer', 'prey', 'game', 'as', 'well', 'law', 'enforcement', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'where', 'will', 'strike', 'next', 'course', 'are', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'movies', 'Saw', 'Seven', 'had', 'depth', 'written', 'dialogue', 'law', 'enforcement', 'here', 'character', 'lines', 'seem', 'be', 'contrived', 'as', 'well', 'silly.From', 'technical', 'perspective', 'even', 'limited', 'budget', 'had', 'true', 'professionals', 'doing', 'camera', 'work', 'photography', 'Similarly', 'even', 'obvious', 'low', 'budget', 'many', 'props', 'chintzy', 'feel', 'seem', 'have', 'done', 'passable', 'job', 'things', 'considered', 'However', 'few', 'horror', 'fans', 'will', 'appreciate', 'details', 'movie', 'frankly', 'scary', 'very', 'entertaining.About', '1000', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'entertaining', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movie', 'best', 'movie', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'worst', 'just', 'plain', 'plot-twist', 'end', 'almost', 'not', 'worth', 'spoiling', 'will', 'leave', 'judge', 'Suffice', 'say', 'more', 'gimmick', 'anything', 'really', 'surprise', 'you.This', 'typical', 'D', 'F', 'horror', 'fare', 'lot', 'screaming', 'running', 'dark', 'corridors', 'flickering', 'light', 'bulbs', 'none', 'enough', 'even', 'allow', 'movie', 'rise', 'level', 'average', 'just', 'when', 'think', 'movie', 'improving', 'little', 'scene', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'described', 'silly.Some', 'have', 'implied', 'one', 'horror', 'movies', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'beg', 'differ', 'will', 'only', 'make', 'friends', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'paying', 'attention', 'want', 'watch', 'spoof', 'horror', 'movie', 'make', 'laugh', 'watchHatchet', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Even', 'faults', '10', 'times', 'funnier', 'this.If', 'are', 'looking', 'mindless', 'horror', 'entertainment', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'satisfy', 'are', 'easy', 'please', 'Only', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'obsessed', 'am', 'watching', 'single', 'horror', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'need', 'rent', 'one', 'everybody', 'else', 'save', 'hour', 'half', 'life', 'avoid', 'one.Avoid']",Are You Scared?

1002529,AQ2UN38CMK119,B000GEIRU0,P. Mann,"[7, 8]","Yes, ""Are You Scared"" is a great deal likeSawandSaw II. That's a given. The plot: Several young adults find themselves in a warehouse after having been abducted. The one thing that links them all is that they submitted videos to be on what they thought was a legitimate television show called ""Are You Scared."" The ersatz ""show"" turns out to be likeFear Factorwith a serious case of 'roid rage. As part of the would-be auditions, each of the young adults had to identify his or her worst fear. Inside the warehouse, each will have to face that fear. This premise is the basis for more of the inventive torture that made the Saw films popular.As I said, yes, this film is like ""Saw."" While that fact certainly causes the film to lose points in the originality category, it does not, in and of itself, mean the film is bad. After all, this film comes at a time when Hollywood is producing remakes (e.g.,The RingandBlack Christmas), sequels (e.g., Saw II andSaw III), remakes of sequels (e.g.,The Grudge 2), prequels of remakes (e.g.,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning), and every other combination of copying imaginable. And, in fairness, it is true that many have not seen and will not see the originals, a fact that I presume explains the scene-for-scene remake of the originalPsycho. So the question is, I think: What does ""Are You Scared"" bring to the table that makes it stand on its own?Only one thing works as an answer. There is one particular torture device that shows great (albeit depraved) cleverness. That device is the one on the cover, a drill that travels on a conveyor belt. That's about the only thing that I can find to recommend this movie, though. After that, the movie is too derivative and too implausible.Two significant elements make the film thoroughly implausible. Well, three if you count the demented killer who has the time and funds to rent warehouses, construct elaborate torture devices, abduct six people, and arrange for their torture. But since that point IS the plot, I'll overlook it. The two elements that I am referring to are the police investigation and the ending.There are only two cops investigating this serial killer (who has done this sort of thing before). The explanation in the film is that one of the cops has cried wolf too many times when he thought he had the killer within his grasp. The real reason, I assume, is cost. It's cheaper to have one semi-rogue cop and a criminal profiler than to have the sort of coordinated effort that would involve scores of officers and detectives. Instead, two people seem to be the extent of the police effort to stop the killer who is playing his game again. Moreover, these two do everything wrong, most notably when one of them rushes alone into a building in an attempt to stop the killer.The second problem is the ending, which undoes almost everything that the film has set up to that point. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that it's thoroughly absurd. One of the victims has a connection to the killer that supposedly explains the reason for the deadly games. But if the filmmakers thought it necessary to have a connection to one character, they apparently thought it thoroughly unnecessary to explain the others or the fact that this killer has done this sort of thing previously.So ""Are You Scared,"" missing question mark and all, is not particularly good. I give it three stars, though, for two reasons. First, I reserve the minimum one star for those films I find truly painful to watch. Second, I thought the film was moderately engaging until the end.

The first is ""I can't believe The Asylum wasn't ALL OVER THIS SCRIPT!"". The second is ""it was released in Japan as an unofficial &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em> sequel"". I kid you not. (The English title of the Japanese release of this film: &lt;em>Jigsaw: Game of Death&lt;/em>. QED.) But the &lt;em>real&lt;/em> joke turned out to be on &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em> distributor Lionsgate, who actually optioned this turd. ""Since you knew all this,"" you ask, ""why on earth did you watch it?"" Simple: when I sorted my Netflix Instant queue by average rating (the Netflix Queue Sorter plugin for Grasemonkey, by the by, which you can find for both Firefox and Chrome, may be the best Internet widget ever. And no, I don't have anything to do with its programming.), &lt;em>Are You Scared?&lt;/em> was the lowest-rated of the 345(!) movies in my queue at the time. How could I &lt;em>not&lt;/em> watch it? The best thing I can say about it is this: I have since watch seven or eight other of the lowest-rated movies in my queue, and a few of them made this silliness look like Oscar material.Plot: after a completely gratutious opening scene that tells us ""this movie is exactly like &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em>"", six teenagers gradually regain consciousness in an abandoned toll and die factory. At the risk of spoilers, I'll give you the next twenty minutes or so: we find out that all of them, at some point in the past, auditioned for a hit reality TV show called Are You Scared?, and they're now on the set. The only problem: all the deaths they thought were fake, well, not so much. And only one of them can survive, if any do. And so Kelly (&lt;em>Fractalus&lt;/em>' Alethea Kutscher in her feature debut), Cherie (Erin Consalvi in her only feature to date), Brandon (&lt;em>Scarred&lt;/em>'s Brad Ashten), Laura (&lt;em>Off the Ledge&lt;/em>'s Carlee Avers in her feature debut), Jason (&lt;em>Last Call Before Sunset&lt;/em>'s Kariem Maybury in his feature debut), and Dylan (&lt;em>Blind Ambition&lt;/em>'s Soren Bowie), assuming any of them survive the first round, where each must face his or her deepst fear, will be pitted against one another in the championship...I will admit that, while I was pretty sure I knew where this was going (there's an early line from Kelly that gives the entire game away), I have to admit I didn't quite figure it was going to get there in the way it did--by jettisoning a large part of its setup (did the filmmakers run out of money?) and heading straight for the climactic confrontation/denouement/final shot sequence that seems almost &lt;em>de rigeur&lt;/em> in horror these days. (Take the hint, aspiring filmmakers: want to make a movie that will wow fans? DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES.) I wish I could say there was some sort of unpreditable twist in there, but... no.The movie is saved from being a complete wash by there being a modicum of decent (not good mind you, just decent) acting from a couple of the principals, though when it comes right down to it the majority of the acting involved in this film was ""look scared and scream a lot""). And it's better than the last three or four movies in the &lt;em>Saw&lt;/em> franchise, though that bar is about as close to the gorund as you can get. So it's not a complete and total waste of time... but it comes pretty darn close. * ",1,Are you stupid?,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,3544,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Are', 'Scared', 'lt', '>', 'Andy', 'Hurst', '2006', 'are', 'two', 'possible', 'punchlines', 'joke', 'lt', 'Are', 'Scared', 'lt', '>', 'so', 'much', 'lt', '>', 'Saw', 'lt', '>', 'are', 'true', 'first', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Asylum', 'was', ""n't"", 'ALL', 'OVER', 'THIS', 'SCRIPT', 'second', 'was', 'released', 'Japan', 'unofficial', 'lt', '>', 'Saw', 'lt', '>', 'sequel', 'kid', 'not', 'English', 'title', 'Japanese', 'release', 'film', 'lt', '>', 'Jigsaw', 'Game', 'Death', 'lt', '>', 'QED', 'lt', '>', 'real', 'lt', '>', 'joke', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'lt', '>', 'Saw', 'lt', '>', 'distributor', 'Lionsgate', 'who', 'actually', 'optioned', 'turd', 'knew', 'ask', 'why', 'earth', 'did', 'watch', 'Simple', 'when', 'sorted', 'Netflix', 'Instant', 'queue', 'average', 'rating', 'Netflix', 'Queue', 'Sorter', 'plugin', 'Grasemonkey', 'can', 'find', 'Firefox', 'Chrome', 'may', 'be', 'best', 'Internet', 'widget', 'ever', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'programming', 'lt', 'Are', 'Scared', 'lt', '>', 'was', 'lowest-rated', '345', 'movies', 'queue', 'time', 'How', 'could', 'lt', '>', 'not', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'watch', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'have', 'watch', 'seven', 'eight', 'other', 'lowest-rated', 'movies', 'queue', 'few', 'made', 'silliness', 'look', 'Oscar', 'material.Plot', 'completely', 'gratutious', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'exactly', 'lt', '>', 'Saw', 'lt', '>', 'six', 'teenagers', 'gradually', 'regain', 'consciousness', 'abandoned', 'toll', 'die', 'factory', 'risk', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'give', 'next', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'find', 'out', 'point', 'past', 'auditioned', 'hit', 'reality', 'TV', 'show', 'called', 'Are', 'Scared', ""'re"", 'now', 'set', 'only', 'problem', 'deaths', 'thought', 'were', 'fake', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'survive', 'do', 'so', 'Kelly', 'lt', '>', 'Fractalus', 'lt', '>', 'Alethea', 'Kutscher', 'feature', 'debut', 'Cherie', 'Erin', 'Consalvi', 'only', 'feature', 'date', 'Brandon', 'lt', '>', 'Scarred', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Brad', 'Ashten', 'Laura', 'lt', '>', 'Ledge', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Carlee', 'Avers', 'feature', 'debut', 'Jason', 'lt', '>', 'Last', 'Call', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Kariem', 'Maybury', 'feature', 'debut', 'Dylan', 'lt', '>', 'Blind', 'Ambition', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Soren', 'Bowie', 'assuming', 'survive', 'first', 'round', 'where', 'must', 'face', 'deepst', 'fear', 'will', 'be', 'pitted', 'one', 'championship', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'knew', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'early', 'line', 'Kelly', 'entire', 'game', 'away', 'have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'figure', 'was', 'going', 'get', 'there', 'way', 'did', 'jettisoning', 'large', 'part', 'setup', 'did', 'filmmakers', 'run', 'money', 'heading', 'straight', 'climactic', 'confrontation/denouement/final', 'shot', 'sequence', 'almost', 'lt', '>', 'de', 'rigeur', 'lt', '>', 'horror', 'days', 'Take', 'hint', 'aspiring', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'make', 'movie', 'will', 'wow', 'fans', 'DO', 'SOMETHING', 'DIFFERENT', 'WITH', 'THE', 'LAST', 'FIFTEEN', 'MINUTES', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'sort', 'unpreditable', 'twist', 'there', 'no.The', 'movie', 'saved', 'being', 'complete', 'wash', 'being', 'modicum', 'decent', 'not', 'good', 'mind', 'just', 'decent', 'acting', 'couple', 'principals', 'when', 'right', 'down', 'majority', 'acting', 'involved', 'film', 'was', 'look', 'scared', 'lot', 'better', 'last', 'three', 'four', 'movies', 'lt', '>', 'Saw', 'lt', '>', 'franchise', 'bar', 'about', 'as', 'close', 'gorund', 'can', 'get', 'not', 'complete', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'pretty', 'darn', 'close', '*']",Are You Scared?
