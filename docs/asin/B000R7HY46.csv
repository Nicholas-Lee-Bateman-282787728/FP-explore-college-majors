1080007,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000R7HY46,Alistair McHarg,"[21, 24]","It's going, it's going, it is OUTTA HERE!  The Bronx Is Burning turns its attention on a very specific time in New York City history and the result is a major league hit.  There are even moments of (Forrest Gump/Zelig)-esque wizardry where documentary footage is kluged with new footage - it's never convincing enough to pass for real, but it's fun.  Even without this techno-trickery the series succeeds in transporting viewers to a turbulent time in NYC history when a lot of things were going wrong all at once.  The long overdue resurgence of baseball's legendary franchise, The Yankees, was just what the doctor ordered to help an ailing city feel better about itself.The only missteps arise from sections devoted to Son of Sam and the Mayoral race; we're never quite certain how relevant these dramas are, or their relationship to the central story.  The actual interviews of participants, by contrast, work very well.  Interviews with Yankee players - including Jackson, sports writers, and Steinbrenner himself, add authority to the story and give a visceral sense of the sustained dysfunction that characterized the team that year.  Only Martin is missing from these interviews - even in history he is trivialized.The drama here arises from a tough drive to the World Series, but the action, and the fun, come from an ongoing battle between three myopic egos that never manage to put their differences aside.  It is a battle of titans and they share the blame equally - indeed - given the situation it's a miracle the team made the playoffs.  Steinbrenner - the owner - is a grandiose, bombastic micro-manager.  Martin - a brilliant player and manager - demonstrates levels of passive aggression and self-destruction so profound they could be record setting.  Jackson embodies the sports super-star celebrity nincompoop - he seems to have been invented to illustrate the phrase - ""a legend in his own mind.""Turturro is amazing as Martin - Martin is a complex man, part megalomaniac, part hapless victim, part creep - Turturro expresses this entire range effortlessly.  Daniel Sanjata has his hands full as Jackson - in many ways Jackson is a larger than life figure - just ask him.  But Sanjata not only looks like Jackson, he manages to express Jackson's clueless narcissism faultlessly.  But the real star turn of this terrific series is Oliver Platt as George Steinbrenner.  Platt's portrayal of Steinbrenner is more like Steinbrenner than Steinbrenner ever was on his best day.  Every minute Platt is on screen is a pleasure to watch. The Bronx Is Burning is an absolutely splendid piece of entertainment.",5,Tempers Are Flaring,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",2007,2618,"['going', 'going', 'OUTTA', 'HERE', 'Bronx', 'Is', 'Burning', 'attention', 'very', 'specific', 'time', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'history', 'result', 'major', 'league', 'hit', 'are', 'even', 'moments', 'Forrest', 'Gump/Zelig', '-esque', 'wizardry', 'where', 'documentary', 'footage', 'kluged', 'new', 'footage', 'never', 'convincing', 'enough', 'pass', 'real', 'fun', 'Even', 'techno-trickery', 'series', 'transporting', 'viewers', 'turbulent', 'time', 'NYC', 'history', 'when', 'lot', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'wrong', 'once', 'long', 'overdue', 'resurgence', 'baseball', 'legendary', 'franchise', 'Yankees', 'was', 'just', 'what', 'doctor', 'ordered', 'help', 'ailing', 'city', 'feel', 'better', 'itself.The', 'only', 'arise', 'sections', 'devoted', 'Son', 'Sam', 'Mayoral', 'race', ""'re"", 'never', 'quite', 'certain', 'how', 'relevant', 'dramas', 'are', 'relationship', 'central', 'story', 'actual', 'interviews', 'participants', 'contrast', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'Interviews', 'Yankee', 'players', 'including', 'Jackson', 'sports', 'writers', 'Steinbrenner', 'add', 'authority', 'story', 'give', 'visceral', 'sense', 'sustained', 'dysfunction', 'characterized', 'team', 'year', 'Only', 'Martin', 'missing', 'interviews', 'even', 'history', 'trivialized.The', 'drama', 'here', 'tough', 'drive', 'World', 'Series', 'action', 'fun', 'come', 'ongoing', 'battle', 'three', 'myopic', 'egos', 'never', 'manage', 'put', 'differences', 'aside', 'battle', 'titans', 'share', 'blame', 'equally', 'indeed', 'given', 'situation', 'miracle', 'team', 'made', 'playoffs', 'Steinbrenner', 'owner', 'grandiose', 'bombastic', 'micro-manager', 'Martin', 'brilliant', 'player', 'manager', 'levels', 'passive', 'aggression', 'self-destruction', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'record', 'setting', 'Jackson', 'sports', 'super-star', 'celebrity', 'nincompoop', 'have', 'been', 'invented', 'illustrate', 'phrase', 'legend', 'own', 'mind', 'Turturro', 'amazing', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'complex', 'man', 'part', 'megalomaniac', 'part', 'hapless', 'victim', 'part', 'creep', 'Turturro', 'entire', 'range', 'effortlessly', 'Daniel', 'Sanjata', 'hands', 'full', 'Jackson', 'many', 'ways', 'Jackson', 'larger', 'life', 'figure', 'just', 'ask', 'Sanjata', 'not', 'only', 'Jackson', 'express', 'Jackson', 'clueless', 'narcissism', 'faultlessly', 'real', 'star', 'turn', 'terrific', 'series', 'Oliver', 'Platt', 'George', 'Steinbrenner', 'Platt', 'portrayal', 'Steinbrenner', 'more', 'Steinbrenner', 'Steinbrenner', 'ever', 'was', 'best', 'day', 'Every', 'minute', 'Platt', 'screen', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Bronx', 'Is', 'Burning', 'absolutely', 'splendid', 'piece', 'entertainment']",The Bronx Is Burning
1080008,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B000R7HY46,Best Of All,"[6, 14]","The 8-episode, weekly miniseries, which originally aired on ESPN from July 9 to August 28, 2007, is based on the outstanding and highly-ambitious book by Jonathan Mahler, entitled, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle for the Soul of a City.Where Mahler successfully weaves sports, politics, socio-economics and crime in the New York City of 1977, the many issues cannot be tackled well in this miniseries format. What makes it on the field is a better-than-average chronicle of the New York Yankees, with the oftentimes much more important historical issues - a controversial mayoral race, municipal layoffs, financial turmoil, a July city blackout & looting and the Son of Sam serial murders - never really making it out of the dugout.The performances by Daniel Sunjata (outfielder and star Reggie Jackson) and John Turturro (manager Billy Martin) are outstanding and they work miracles in trying to bring some type of flow to the script. But their strength actually shows the weakness of miniseries; there is way too much focus on this dysfunctional relationship.The championship run by the Yankees ultimately was one shining moment in one of the bleakest years in the city's history. It wasn't all about baseball, though the miniseries makes it appear that the action in Yankee Stadium was the straw that stirred the municipal drink.",2,Too Little Time To Cover The Action,1191628800,"10 6, 2007",2007,1385,"['8-episode', 'weekly', 'miniseries', 'originally', 'aired', 'ESPN', 'July', '9', 'August', '28', '2007', 'based', 'outstanding', 'highly-ambitious', 'book', 'Jonathan', 'Mahler', 'entitled', 'Ladies', 'Gentlemen', 'Bronx', 'Burning', '1977', 'Baseball', 'Politics', 'Battle', 'Soul', 'City.Where', 'Mahler', 'successfully', 'sports', 'politics', 'socio-economics', 'crime', 'New', 'York', 'City', '1977', 'many', 'issues', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tackled', 'well', 'miniseries', 'format', 'What', 'field', 'better-than-average', 'chronicle', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'oftentimes', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'historical', 'issues', 'controversial', 'mayoral', 'race', 'municipal', 'layoffs', 'financial', 'turmoil', 'July', 'city', 'blackout', 'looting', 'Son', 'Sam', 'serial', 'murders', 'never', 'really', 'making', 'dugout.The', 'performances', 'Daniel', 'Sunjata', 'outfielder', 'star', 'Reggie', 'Jackson', 'John', 'Turturro', 'manager', 'Billy', 'Martin', 'are', 'outstanding', 'work', 'miracles', 'trying', 'bring', 'type', 'flow', 'script', 'strength', 'actually', 'weakness', 'miniseries', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'focus', 'dysfunctional', 'relationship.The', 'championship', 'run', 'Yankees', 'ultimately', 'was', 'one', 'shining', 'moment', 'one', 'bleakest', 'years', 'city', 'history', 'was', ""n't"", 'baseball', 'miniseries', 'appear', 'action', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'was', 'straw', 'stirred', 'municipal', 'drink']",The Bronx Is Burning

This miniseries should be a time capsule for a time that many have only heard or read about.  I was a kid in '77 but remember the blackout and Son of Sam and Billy Martin's famous tirade against Reggie Jackson. The inner workings of this team is what's fascinating. It's capture is so true of the time that it feels more like 1977 than I remember. Steinbrenner's portrayal is on point. He certainly hasn't changed his M.O. and at times his over-weening ego was very humorous to watch. All the actors work effortlessly to convincingly portray the real people on the Yankees of '77.

However, I found this to be a great series to watch.Let's start with the obvious.  It was a tumultous summer in the Bronx.  The Yankees were losing, the Son of Sam was on the loose, and the economy was on the brink of a depression.  This film focuses mainly on the Yankees (as it should have), but also touches upon the other important events going on outside of Yankee stadium.  I wish they could have dedicated a little more on the outside events, because even though the Yankees win a World Series title, the other events gripped the country just as much.  And the mix of actual news footage, mixed in with the film footage was very fluid.  Sometimes it was only the grainy film look that could allow you to tell which was real and which was the movie.The acting was terrific from top to bottom.  Daniel Sunjata (Rescue Me)as Reggie Jackson and John Tuturro as Billy Martin were definitely a great combo.  I may not totally agree with the choice of Oliver Platt as Steinbrenner, but he is adequate in the role.  All of the other supporting cast members did great as well.  Look and see who you will recognize.As sacreligious as it will be to purchase this, I plan on doing so.  ESPN did a great job with this story.

1080023,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000R7HY46,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","""The Bronx is Burning"" is ESPN's mini-series about the 1977 New York Yankees, when owner George Steinbrenner (Oliver Platt), brought in Reggie Jackson (Daniel Sunjata) to play for manager Billy Martin (John Turturro).  Martin wanted Bobby Grich to play shortstop, not to mention wanting to bat Chris Chambliss clean-up instead of Jackson.  The headlines are talking about how many games the Yankees are behind the Orioles and/or Red Sox as the summer gets hotter, but most of the drama is off the field.  Will George fire Billy?  Will Billy bat Reggie cleanup?  Will Reggie ever stop saying things to the press that tick off his teammates?  The answer is that in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series versus the Los Angeles Dodgers, Reggie Jackson will hit three home runs, on three swings, off of three different pitchers.The point going into this mini-series is that we know how it ends, or, at least, that the Yankees win the World Series, because there is still the aftermath of the victory, with Martin still tormented by his demons and the bit before the final credits where we find out what happened to the main characters in this little drama.  The title ""The Bronx is Burning"" comes from what Howard Cosell said during the ABC telecast of Game Two of the 1977 World Series, where a large fire was raging out of control near Yankee Stadium.  Jonathan Mahler used Cosell's words as the title of his book, ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics, and the Battle for the Soul of a City.""  There are points where the series wants to be about more than the Yankees, focusing on the New York Police Department's pursuit of the Son of Sam killer, the blackout that saw widespread looting in the city, and the financial problems that would see Ed Koch end up as mayor of the city.  But time and time again we come back to Steinbrenner, Jackson, and Martin, and it is always Martin who stands out, thanks to John Turturro.Watching Turturro's performance as Martin I was reminded, of all things, of Robert Duvall's performance as Augustus McRae in ""Lonesome Dove,"" because I knew I was once again watching a character actor at the top of his game.  I know the Emmy nominations are a long way off, but Turturro has to be the one to beat for Best Actor in a Mini-Series.  Platt's performance seems less and less like a caricature of Steinbrenner in each episode and Sunjata never seems to really nail Reggie, but Turturro is the one to watch.  You can just see the tumblers of Billy Martin's mind turning every time you look at Turturro's eyes.  I also thought highly of Joe Grifasi's performance as Yogi Berra, especially in his scenes with Turturro.  Grifasi captures Berra as the calming influence on the Yankee's bench without ever resorting to his famous Yogiisms.  I was skeptical of Christopher McDonald being cast as Joe DiMaggio, but was certainly impressed by the results.In the first half of the mini-series The Son of Sam and the race for mayor New York City are big concerns, but by the time David Berkowitz is caught everything other than baseball gets out of the way.  I would have preferred to spend that time looking at more of the Yankees besides Jackson.  I mean, come on, should we really have more of Fran Healy (Loren Dean) than Thurman Munson (Erik Jensen)?  Only if the focus in on Reggie, because Healy was the only Yankee with whom Jackson was on speaking terms.  Healy does have a big moment, when he counsels Reggie to take begin benched for Game 5 of ALCS, but Munson was the heart of the Yankees during that period and there should be more of him.  I hate to think that Mickey Rivers (Leonard Robinson) always trying to hit his teammates up for money to cover gambling debts should be the most memorable thing we get out of ""The Bronx ix Burning"" after all the stuff about Reggie Jackson (or should I say, ""Reg-gie"" Jackson?) on a team that has ""Catfish"" Hunter (Jason Kosow)?I wonder if there were concerns with staying away from some of the other players because they went on to write books.  You have Graig Nettles, who wrote ""Balls,"" and Sparky Lyle's ""The Bronx Zoo"" (the latter is about the 1978 season, but it Lyle does touch on the previous year when he was the American League Cy Young Award winner).  Granted, Reggie Jackson was the most colorful person on the team, but both Nettles (Alex Crammer) and Lyle were considerable characters in their own right and apparently nobody even plays Lyle in the series (they could glue on the mustache).In the end, I round up on ""The Bronx ix Burning"" not only because of Turturro's masterful performance, but also because of the extras ESPN provides.  The ""Backstory"" provided at the end of each episode when it aired on ESPN as well as all the things to check out at the show's website (e.g., ""Go Back to 1977""), embrace the fact that this is a dramatization of what happened, and they are only capturing part of the story.  This 3-disc DVD also loads the bases when it comes to extras.",5,"John Turturro as Billy Martin is the one who is on fire in ""The Bronx if Burning""",1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,4987,"['Bronx',

1080026,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,B000R7HY46,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[2, 2]","Even a lot of Yankee haters will enjoy this miniseries, this reviewer can attest to that.  When this show first aired on ESPN,  I wasn't going to watch it.  It was about the Yankees winning one of their many World Series titles, yuck!  But then ESPN re-aired the episodes, over and over.  I started watching and then couldn't change the channel, even if I'd already seen the episode.  Although the miniseries, as an ESPN original production, focused on the tumultuous 1977 season for the Yankees with the Steinbrenner-Martin-Jackson triangle, the show was based on Jonathan Mahler's book which includes the Son of Sam, the important mayoral elections, and the blackout.  It was a tumultuous year for the entire city, not just the baseball team.The miniseries expertly combines vintage footage and audio with new footage along with the music of the Ramones that recreates the look and feel of 1977.  The acting is excellent.  Oliver Pratt, John Turturo, Daniel Sunjata, and Erik Jensen are spot on in their roles as George Steinbrenner, Billy Martin, Reggie Jackson, and Thurman Munson as is everyone else in their roles.  Steinbrenner is cocky and arrogant, Martin is volatile and insecure, Reggie is smug and intellectual comparing himself to Jonathan Livingston Seagull, and Munson is the tough, blue collar workhorse.  The search for the serial killer was also very well-done.  I read the book and enjoyed the miniseries much more because the book placed more emphasis on New York politics which does not hold the attention the .44 Caliber killer, blackout lootings, and Yankee intrigue does.The ESPN airing often had interviews after each episode to further explain the events of that show.  This DVD has those interviews in the bonus features disc.  Other bonuses include ""Outtakes"" which are bloopers made mostly by Oliver Pratt, ""Webisodes"" that are about 1:30 each and are sometimes very funny, a 23-minute ""On the Set Featurette,"" and more discussion on the ""Fenway Dugout Brawl"" (actually a heated argument that almost came to blows between Martin and Jackson) and the Sport Magazine (""straw that stirs the drink"") article. The ""webisodes"" include Yogisms, what would Jesus bat, Mickey River's spending problems, and Thurman Munson talking about his father.The interviews include George Steinbrenner discussing his childhood taking care of chickens and trying to live up to his fathers expectations.  He also talks about the atmosphere he faced when taking over the Yankees, his attempts to help Billy Martin, his thoughts on Reggie Jackson and his attitude regarding Yankee pride and appearance.  Reggie Jackson talks about entering the league with a brash attitude during a time when he was supposed to ""know his place,"" his famous quotes, relationship with Martin, the ""straw the stirs the drink"" article, and his three-home-run Game 6 in the World Series against the Dodgers.  Billy Martin's son talks about his father's tough upbringing as ""an outsider in his own home,"" his spiritual side, relationship with Casey Stengel, Steinbrenner and Reggie Jackson, the Fenway blow-up, the night Munson died, and his death on Christmas day 1989.  Finally, actor John Turturo talks about playing Billy Martin.The Featurette has a little bit of everything as does the miniseries itself.  It includes interview clips of the reporters, players, and others who were involved in the stories of 1977 New York.  It talks about the preparation of some of the actors; for example, Sunjata had to learn Reggie Jackson's swing.  Also there is an interesting clip on how different footage is combined to give the show an authentic 1977 look.  You do not have to be a Yankees fan to enjoy this DVD set.

Three hours later my husband came home, said, ""What are we watching?"" and sat down beside me. Three hours after that, we only managed to tear ourselves away because a storm was coming and we had to unplug the TV. It was that good!The series portrays the Yankees' tumultuous 1977 season against the background of the events in NYC that summer. Although the Yankees were loaded with colorful, over-the-top characters, the main focus is on the ""relationship"" between George Steinbrenner (Oliver Platt) and Billy Martin (John Turturro). In a better world, George and Billy would've gone to couples counseling and learned to compromise for the good of the team, but in reality they crashed like a baseball-themed Hindenburg--repeatedly, and spectacularly. At the same time, the Son of Sam was terrorizing the city, an ungodly heat wave had everyone sweltering, a mayoral campaign was heating up, and a thunderstorm elsewhere on the power grid caused a blackout of the city. All the events seem to mirror each other, and all are recreated with authenticity. It's obvious that the producers researched the events and people well, and original news footage is mixed in to give a ""you are there"" feel.As far as the acting, everyone does a good job, but Turturro and Platt especially stand out. Turturro seems to have a knack for taking abrasive characters and making them sympathetic--he did the same thing with Howard Cosell in ""Monday Night Mayhem."" And Platt is hilarious as Steinbrenner; he has the voice and mannerisms down pat. Daniel Sunjata makes a good Reggie Jackson, even though he doesn't really look or sound that much like the real Reggie. The rest of the cast also works well. Nice additional features are the interviews at the end of each episode--not just with Yankee players, but cops involved in the Son of Sam investigation, electric company workers, etc.It'd probably be good to have a little baseball background to watch this, but you wouldn't need much; my husband has no interest in baseball and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. It would be good for couples to watch together, because whichever one wasn't interested in sports would probably be interested in the background events and vice versa.

It's worth it just for John Turturro's nuanced portrayal of the complex Billy Martin, but Kevin Conway, Erik Jensen and Joe Grifasi also stand out. My favorite scenes are Yogi's shrug and a hilarious conversation between Munson and Martin about hitting, but the way the archival footage is woven together with the new material makes the baseball scenes compelling, too. As Shakespearean as some of the characters and conflicts are, I still think ""The Bronx is Burning"" would have been even better if it were condensed into a shorter time frame.

1080030,A27N0FKWUI2WFS,B000R7HY46,Todd Kay,"[6, 8]","Jonathan Mahler's acclaimed 2005 book (described, strangely, as a ""novel"" in the on-screen credit here) was an ambitious chronicle of the turbulent year of 1977 in New York City. A reader could open it at random and find himself immersed in the bitterly contested Democratic mayoral primary, the city's deepening fiscal crisis, the Con Ed blackout and subsequent night of looting, the rise of Rupert Murdoch's tabloid culture, the city's increasingly assertive and visible gay community, the cresting of disco and the restive undercurrents of punk. The Yankees' place in Mahler's narrative was as a first among equals. The team served to encapsulate New York's strife, bellicosity, internecine squabbles, and penchant for self-sabotage, but also its rich heritage, its tenacity, its enduring capacity for excellence.ESPN's eight-part miniseries both attempts and achieves less than Mahler's tour de force of pop history. I am reminded, oddly, of the film adaptation of another sprawling ""New York as it was then"" book, E. L. Doctorow's RAGTIME, the Milos Forman film of which promoted a single narrative thread (the story of Coalhouse Walker) to the diminution or exclusion of several others. Not surprisingly, with ESPN footing the bill, this is a miniseries about baseball. Actors have not been cast to portray Bella Abzug, Ed Koch, and Mario Cuomo; the mayoral race is dealt with in flurries of news clips. The blackout is in as a minor diversion, but Murdoch and his media machinations are out altogether, as is almost anything that makes a feint at sociological commentary. The one non-Yankee topic that does get significant screen time is the murder spree of David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam (the ""44-Caliber Killer,"" as he was initially dubbed). Unfortunately, separated from a context that would lend purpose to them, the Sam scenes are the weakest in the series. The reenactments of the murders compare unfavorably with similar but more frightening and intense ones in ZODIAC, while the scenes of dogged/ranting cops and journalists trying to make sense of the case are standard-issue procedural drama. In the early episodes, baseball comedy/drama and serial-killer terror alternate in such bewilderingly random fashion that younger viewers may be expecting the stories to intersect somehow (""Does the Son of Sam end up killing one of the Yankees' wives?"").In the long stretches when the series is what it wants to be -- a none-too-deep but colorful and affectionate soap-opera dramatization of the '77 Yankees' season, focusing on a combustible triumvirate of big personalities with daddy issues (team owner George Steinbrenner, manager Billy Martin, and star slugger Reggie Jackson) -- it is enjoyable and addictive. Having missed the series in first run, I devoured the eight episodes on DVD, having great fun watching even as I catalogued shortcomings: all of the above noted; poor F/X work in the stadium scenes, betraying budget restrictions; woeful force-feeding of exposition (listen and wince at the terrible line meant to educate the uninitiated on Martin's history and accomplishments as a Yankee player, in his first phone-call scene with Steinbrenner). The enterprise is elevated by one brilliant performance. Though the script barely scrapes the self-destructive, tragic side of Martin, depriving the actor of some opportunities, John Turturro's uncanny impersonation is both forceful and poignant, a reminder that great acting can fill in a number of blanks. One haunted, dead-eyed look over the rim of a glass compensates for the loss of whole pages of Mahler's elucidating prose. As Steinbrenner, Oliver Platt executes the broad material given him as well as anyone could have, playing to the hilt the single side of Steinbrenner allowed him, and clearly enjoys himself. Daniel Sunjata fitfully taps into Reggie Jackson's magnetism and contradictory nature. In smaller roles, Kevin Conway has perfect pitch as Steinbrenner's long-suffering underboss, the savvy Gabe Paul, weary of the bickering and pettiness of the less secure egos around him, always keeping a jaundiced eye on the long-withheld prize of a Series ring. As no-bull Yankee captain/catcher Thurman Munson, Erik Jensen is exceptionally well cast in look and also has the supporting-actor gift of suggesting an interesting life taking place off-screen. He and this character deserve a TV-movie of their own. A deadpan discussion between Munson and Martin, on the occasion of the former's 100th home run, culminates in a bigger laugh than I have gotten from any sitcom in years. The series, in general, is usually at its best in the humorous moments -- see also a discussion between Mickey Rivers and Yogi Berra on the possibilities of Jesus Christ as baseball star.The bonus disc contains an assortment of deleted scenes (most were wise deletions) and Webisode ephemera; present-day interviews (weirdly presented in a dewy-lyrical, Hallmark-card style) with Steinbrenner, Jackson, and the late Martin's son; and featurettes on the Martin/Jackson Fenway dugout brawl and on Reggie's infamous interview in SPORT magazine, which made clubhouse life difficult for him early in his Yankee tenure. He and the reporter, Robert Ward, reiterate long-held and irreconcilable positions on what was said and in what context. Those of us who were children in 1977 can look at the gas-guzzler cars and the outdated hairstyles and clothes (especially in the news clips) and realize with a start that all of this must be as strange and remote to the youth of today as footage of World War II victory celebrations was to us at the time. I cannot conclude without praising the music, good for an additional half a star all by itself, from the swaggering vintage funk over the opening credits (it would have served perfectly as a TV theme of that era) to the inspired choice of spiky Ramones tunes for linking montages of headlines and on-field action.
