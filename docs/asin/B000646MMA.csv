858624,AC069GBU16MVN,B000646MMA,"A. G. ""Xela""","[76, 87]","Before my review of this film, let me begin by saying that I'm 33 years old and have never been very politically active. I've never felt a strong allegiance to either of the major political parties. Both parties have their strengths and weaknesses. Because this year's election holds so much at stake, I felt it necessary to digest as much information as I could, from both major campaigns and for the first time, vote.Going Upriver is a truly moving documentary. It reminds us of how pointless war destroys both  human life and spirit. The film helped me to develop a new appreciation for our veterans and the price they paid to serve our country.Going Upriver gives real insight into John Kerry's character and helped me to understand the backbone of his political convictions. Through archival footage, it shows how a young, active college student and natural leader loved his country, believed it's government enough to join the armed services and fought for what he'd been led by them to believe was the right thing to do. John demonstrates his honor in battle, but also sees the ugly side of injustice. After realizing that he'd been mislead by his government to fight in a war which achieved so little at the cost of the lives of so many, the film shows how John Kerry stood up for the good of his fellow veterans and for those who were still stuck in the hell of a pointless war.To me, the most compelling part of the film was the archival footage of our troops in battle and veterans back at home. It was gut-wrenching to watch the veterans dedicate the tossing away of their war medals in tears and anguish during an emotional ceremony at the nation's capital. It was at the same time very beautiful to see them completely reject the lies told by their commander-in-chief to the degree of throwing away what was for many, all they had to show for their years of service.After viewing Going Upriver, I feel that I have a MUCH greater understanding of John Kerry's political and strategic tactics. I know that he has exactly what it takes to lead a country in a time or war. He's been through hell and spent a much longer period of time than his political opponent working for the good of the country and his fellow man. He knows what it feels like to be under fire in combat behind enemy lines. After viewing the film and seeing what he's been through, John Kerry's words have taken on a deeper meaning to me. I've never trusted politicians much, as they make great promises only to break them after getting elected. But John Kerry has lived the same convictions that he talks about today for over 30 years. He can back up what he says with his past actions.Even if you're not politically active, see this film! It delivers a powerful message with regard to what our veterans have gone through for this country.On a final note, although not completely identical, the similarities between the government's portrayal of and actions regarding the war in Vietnam and the current war in Iraq are frightening...",5,Deeply Moving,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,3014,"['review', 'film', 'let', 'begin', 'saying', ""'m"", '33', 'years', 'old', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'politically', 'active', ""'ve"", 'never', 'felt', 'strong', 'allegiance', 'major', 'political', 'parties', 'parties', 'have', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'year', 'election', 'so', 'much', 'stake', 'felt', 'necessary', 'digest', 'as', 'much', 'information', 'could', 'major', 'campaigns', 'first', 'time', 'vote.Going', 'Upriver', 'truly', 'moving', 'documentary', 'how', 'pointless', 'war', 'human', 'life', 'spirit', 'film', 'helped', 'develop', 'new', 'appreciation', 'veterans', 'price', 'paid', 'serve', 'country.Going', 'Upriver', 'real', 'insight', 'John', 'Kerry', 'character', 'helped', 'understand', 'backbone', 'political', 'convictions', 'archival', 'footage', 'how', 'young', 'active', 'college', 'student', 'natural', 'leader', 'loved', 'country', 'believed', 'government', 'enough', 'join', 'armed', 'services', 'fought', 'what', ""'d"", 'been', 'led', 'believe', 'was', 'right', 'thing', 'do', 'John', 'honor', 'battle', 'also', 'ugly', 'side', 'injustice', 'realizing', ""'d"", 'been', 'mislead', 'government', 'fight', 'war', 'achieved', 'so', 'little', 'cost', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'how', 'John', 'Kerry', 'stood', 'up', 'good', 'fellow', 'veterans', 'who', 'were', 'still', 'stuck', 'hell', 'pointless', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'archival', 'footage', 'troops', 'battle', 'veterans', 'back', 'home', 'was', 'gut-wrenching', 'watch', 'veterans', 'dedicate', 'tossing', 'away', 'war', 'medals', 'tears', 'anguish', 'emotional', 'ceremony', 'nation', 'capital', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'beautiful', 'see', 'completely', 'reject', 'lies', 'told', 'commander-in-chief', 'degree', 'throwing', 'away', 'what', 'was', 'many', 'had', 'show', 'years', 'service.After', 'viewing', 'Going', 'Upriver', 'feel', 'have', 'MUCH', 'greater', 'understanding', 'John', 'Kerry', 'political', 'strategic', 'tactics', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'lead', 'country', 'time', 'war', 'been', 'hell', 'spent', 'much', 'longer', 'period', 'time', 'political', 'opponent', 'working', 'good', 'country', 'fellow', 'man', 'what', 'be', 'fire', 'combat', 'enemy', 'lines', 'viewing', 'film', 'seeing', 'what', 'been', 'John', 'Kerry', 'words', 'have', 'taken', 'deeper', 'meaning', ""'ve"", 'never', 'trusted', 'politicians', 'much', 'make', 'great', 'promises', 'only', 'break', 'getting', 'elected', 'John', 'Kerry', 'lived', 'same', 'convictions', 'today', '30', 'years', 'can', 'back', 'up', 'what', 'past', 'actions.Even', ""'re"", 'not', 'politically', 'active', 'see', 'film', 'powerful', 'message', 'regard', 'what', 'veterans', 'have', 'gone', 'country.On', 'final', 'note', 'not', 'completely', 'identical', 'similarities', 'government', 'portrayal', 'actions', 'regarding', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'current', 'war', 'Iraq', 'are', 'frightening']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry
858625,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000646MMA,Alex Udvary,"[6, 9]","Some may feel I've waited a little too long to see this documentary. That it loses some of its purpose after the fact. In case you haven't heard John Kerry lost the election. But despite this I was eager to watch this. I think the subject is a fascinating one and can be enjoyed at any time. Plus, don't forget it's the 30th anniversary to the end of the Vietnam War. But that had nothing to do with why I wanted to see this in the first place.Last year there was a parade of political documentaries making their way to theatres. There was of course ""Fahrenheit 9\11"", the best of them all. ""Uncovered:The Truth About the Iraq War"", ""The Hunting of the President"" (this was about Bill Clinton) and ""Bush's Brain"" (about Karl Rove) to me the least effective of these documentaries. But with all these documentaries I learned something. They provide some information I hadn't know. One of the main reasons I wasn't overwhelmed with ""Going Upriver"" was due to the fact it didn't say anything I didn't already know. Because the 2004 Presidential election was so heated I think those of us who considered ourselves informed voters knew all the stories going around about each candidate. This documentary was released at about the time th ""Swiftboat Vets For Truth"" were making their claims, all of which have been refuted.As I watched this documentary I was struck by what I saw. I thought what a shame it was that the John Kerry of today could not match the Kerry of yesterday. What a great speaker he was at one point. He had such an eloquent way with words. You could tell he was standing up for something he believed in. It was personal.The John Kerry we saw during the election just seemed to lack the ability to stand up and fight. How the Republicans were able to paint a war hero as a coward is beyond me. To hear people like vice-president Dick Cheney question Kerry's wounds and his medals is quite frankly disgusting. But why wouldn't Kerry defend himself? I doubt it would have made a difference in the election results but at least Kerry would have had the satisfaction of knowing he stood up for himself.But this documentary doesn't cover any of this material. Kerry is not interviewed. He is only shown on-screen when old footage is shown. The documentary only follows the story about his activites when returning home from Vietnam. No mention is even made that he is running for president. I mention this because it's important that people do not think this was an endorsment of Kerry's nomination. Perhaps the filmaker wanted him to win but no bias is presented. It is a straight foward look at what John Kerry did and his intentions. It was an attempt to set the record straight. Because of this maybe, just maybe some Kerry bashers would be able to watch this documentary and not hate him. I'm not saying it will change anyone's mind, but at the very least it may help you understand him more. Maybe.The John Kerry presented in this film was a man who did in fact have the mental capability to lead this country. He expresses himself in a clear thoughful and articulate manner and despite what you may have heard from Republicans showed the abilty to make wise decisions. And I think Kerry showed these qualities during the election.I recommend people see this documentary despite perhaps already knowing the information provided here. It is well-made and informative.*** 1\2 out of *****Bottom-line: If you kept up with the election nothing here will surprise you but it will serve as a constant reminder of the man John Kerry is.

Mr. Kerry was raised believing in the equality and fairness for all Americans. He went to Vietnam to help his country but then realized what a waste it really was. Upon return, he fought for the lives of the youth who were being sent to fight an unjust war. Nixon used his dirty tricks against teh anti-war campaign and Kerry (in particular). We even get to see John O'Neill who recently wrote a book on Kerry which has been proven to be full of lies and general inaccurancies. In the long run, we see that Kerry is a man of his convictions and principles.

858627,A3JPFWKS83R49V,B000646MMA,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[2, 8]","This documentary is dedicated to the Vietnam War era and the role U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate John Kerry played during his time in battle and his time as a peace activist. Kerry's early life at Yale, his time spent manning swift boats in Vietnam, and his post- war stint as an anti- war activist are covered in this film. The viewer is taken to the rivers of Vietnam and back to the USA to witness war protests from the 1970's as Kerry takes the lead in speaking out against what he feels is an unethical war.Many childhood friends, war time acquaintances, and well- known politicians make appearances in this film to talk to the viewer about John Kerry. They are all biased in favor of Kerry, with not one of them making any negative statements toward the Massachusetts Senator. They talk about Kerry's greatness in battle, as a leader, and as a politician. There is nothing negative said about Kerry, and this fact could turn off some viewers who prefer a more balanced viewpoint. This documentary was released about five weeks before the 2004 election, and it was obviously timed this way to help Kerry at the polls.Probably the most interesting parts of this documentary are those found near the end when Kerry has returned from Vietnam a disillusioned man, ready to let the people know how wrong it is for the United States to be involved in this war. There is one scene, for example, showing Kerry on the Dick Caveat show with Nixon's communication director. In this and other scenes, Kerry shows his knack for communication and articulation. He states his points very well, and his opponents are often left looking stupid, with no idea how to rebut his claims.Director George Butler did a good job in the production of this documentary. The film flows nicely from scene to scene and many different people are permitted some time in front of the camera. Kerry and others speak (like Nixon, LBJ, and others), but only via archive footage. There are also some graphic scenes of violence taken from Vietnam, and this is the main reason for the film's PG-13 rating.This documentary moves a little slowly in some places, but there is a good soundtrack of 1960's tunes from artists like John Lennon, Bob Dylan, David Crosby, and others that helps to keep the entertainment level in the moderate range. It would probably have been a better documentary if it was better balanced and/or if it included biographical information from Kerry's later days as a politician. But taken as it is, this is still a documentary worth watching. It shows how one man can speak his mind and make a difference in the politics of his country.",4,John Kerry's Tour of Duty,1118361600,"06 10, 2005",2005,2634,"['documentary', 'dedicated', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'era', 'role', 'U.S', 'Senator', 'Presidential', 'candidate', 'John', 'Kerry', 'played', 'time', 'battle', 'time', 'peace', 'activist', 'Kerry', 'early', 'life', 'Yale', 'time', 'spent', 'manning', 'swift', 'boats', 'Vietnam', 'post-', 'war', 'stint', 'anti-', 'war', 'activist', 'are', 'covered', 'film', 'viewer', 'taken', 'rivers', 'Vietnam', 'back', 'USA', 'witness', 'war', 'protests', '1970', 'Kerry', 'lead', 'speaking', 'out', 'what', 'unethical', 'war.Many', 'childhood', 'friends', 'war', 'time', 'acquaintances', 'well-', 'known', 'politicians', 'make', 'appearances', 'film', 'talk', 'viewer', 'John', 'Kerry', 'are', 'biased', 'favor', 'Kerry', 'not', 'one', 'making', 'negative', 'statements', 'Massachusetts', 'Senator', 'talk', 'Kerry', 'greatness', 'battle', 'leader', 'politician', 'nothing', 'negative', 'said', 'Kerry', 'fact', 'could', 'turn', 'off', 'viewers', 'who', 'prefer', 'more', 'balanced', 'viewpoint', 'documentary', 'was', 'released', 'five', 'weeks', '2004', 'election', 'was', 'obviously', 'timed', 'way', 'help', 'Kerry', 'polls.Probably', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'documentary', 'are', 'found', 'end', 'when', 'Kerry', 'returned', 'Vietnam', 'disillusioned', 'man', 'ready', 'let', 'people', 'know', 'how', 'wrong', 'United', 'States', 'be', 'involved', 'war', 'one', 'scene', 'example', 'showing', 'Kerry', 'Dick', 'Caveat', 'show', 'Nixon', 'communication', 'director', 'other', 'scenes', 'Kerry', 'knack', 'communication', 'articulation', 'points', 'very', 'well', 'opponents', 'are', 'often', 'left', 'looking', 'stupid', 'idea', 'how', 'rebut', 'claims.Director', 'George', 'Butler', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'production', 'documentary', 'film', 'nicely', 'scene', 'scene', 'many', 'different', 'people', 'are', 'permitted', 'time', 'front', 'camera', 'Kerry', 'others', 'speak', 'Nixon', 'LBJ', 'others', 'only', 'archive', 'footage', 'are', 'also', 'graphic', 'scenes', 'violence', 'taken', 'Vietnam', 'main', 'reason', 'film', 'PG-13', 'rating.This', 'documentary', 'little', 'slowly', 'places', 'good', 'soundtrack', '1960', 'tunes', 'artists', 'John', 'Lennon', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'David', 'Crosby', 'others', 'keep', 'entertainment', 'level', 'moderate', 'range', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'documentary', 'was', 'better', 'balanced', 'included', 'biographical', 'information', 'Kerry', 'later', 'days', 'politician', 'taken', 'still', 'documentary', 'worth', 'watching', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'can', 'speak', 'mind', 'make', 'difference', 'politics', 'country']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry

That aside, this is an occasionally powerful documentary that feels somewhat rushed, and might have been even better if it were not an election year.  That way, the filmmakers could've concentrated more on the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, an organization that has been portrayed inaccurately over these past few months.One thing I like especially about the film is how Kerry isn't always the most dominant presence in it.  The movie is strong on context, focusing on veterans who joined Kerry in the movement to end the war in addition to those who fought with him.The use of archival materials such as Super 8 movies shot in the 1960s and 70s, and still photographs and interviews, is understated and effective.  Director George Butler, whose ""Pumping Iron"" is a first-rate documentary, lets the force of the veterans' stories, and voices and images, carry the film forward.The most powerful moment in the film is the one that should be: footage of the 1971 protest where Vietnam veterans discarded their medals, citations, and other military honors on the steps of the US Capitol.  Butler lets the details of that protest create an extended sequence in the movie that becomes genuinely dramatic.  The film has no narration because, again, the voices and images of the veterans say all that is needed.As far as the controversy goes, no one can deny that many veterans disagree with John Kerry's stance on the war and his actions 33 years ago.  They have a right to their anger, just as veterans with a different viewpoint recognized the antiwar movement as something they wanted to be in because they wanted to help save lives.  Vietnam Veterans against the War was not simply an angry, reckless protest group.  Their protests were confrontational but not aggressive, and the group also was probably the first organization to offer psychological counseling for veterans with Post-traumatic stress disorder, which is at high levels among Vietnam veterans.",4,Solid documentary that should have taken more time,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2063,"['get', 'way', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'want', 'keep', 'reading', 'am', 'voting', 'John', 'Kerry', 'aside', 'occasionally', 'powerful', 'documentary', 'somewhat', 'rushed', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'were', 'not', 'election', 'year', 'way', 'filmmakers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'concentrated', 'more', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'organization', 'been', 'portrayed', 'inaccurately', 'past', 'few', 'months.One', 'thing', 'like', 'especially', 'film', 'how', 'Kerry', ""n't"", 'always', 'most', 'dominant', 'presence', 'movie', 'strong', 'context', 'focusing', 'veterans', 'who', 'joined', 'Kerry', 'movement', 'end', 'war', 'addition', 'who', 'fought', 'him.The', 'use', 'archival', 'materials', 'such', 'Super', '8', 'movies', 'shot', '1960s', '70s', 'still', 'photographs', 'interviews', 'understated', 'effective', 'Director', 'George', 'Butler', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'first-rate', 'documentary', 'force', 'veterans', 'stories', 'voices', 'images', 'carry', 'film', 'most', 'powerful', 'moment', 'film', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'footage', '1971', 'protest', 'where', 'Vietnam', 'discarded', 'medals', 'citations', 'other', 'military', 'honors', 'steps', 'US', 'Capitol', 'Butler', 'details', 'protest', 'create', 'extended', 'sequence', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'dramatic', 'film', 'narration', 'again', 'voices', 'images', 'veterans', 'say', 'needed.As', 'far', 'controversy', 'one', 'can', 'deny', 'many', 'veterans', 'disagree', 'John', 'Kerry', 'stance', 'war', 'actions', '33', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'right', 'anger', 'just', 'veterans', 'different', 'viewpoint', 'recognized', 'antiwar', 'movement', 'something', 'wanted', 'be', 'wanted', 'help', 'save', 'lives', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'angry', 'reckless', 'protest', 'group', 'protests', 'were', 'confrontational', 'not', 'aggressive', 'group', 'also', 'was', 'probably', 'first', 'organization', 'offer', 'psychological', 'counseling', 'veterans', 'Post-traumatic', 'stress', 'disorder', 'high', 'levels', 'Vietnam', 'veterans']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry

It is amazing how many parallels the Vietnam war has to the current war in Iraq, here are some lines from the movie:- We must liberate the people- We must win the hearts and minds of the people- We don't do body counts- We must spread freedom- I don't understand why we are there (some troops say this)- The reasons for the war keeps changingIsn't it just like Iraq? You would think people would learn from a war which happened less than 40 years ago!Anyway, most of America wanted our troops pulled out of Vietnam but the Nixon Administration did not want to be ""the first administration to lose a war"".  So I guess it was better to let people die than to admit you are wrong. (over 58,000 American soldiers died and 300,000 soldiers were injured!!, 3,000,0000 Vietnamese killed and over half were civilians)When Kerry comes back from Vietnam, him and thousands of other Vietnam Vets formed a peace group and joined the anti-war movement. The anti-war movement was strong during the late 60s because of the draft. Right now with our Iraq war, there is not a draft so millions of high school/college and University students are oblivious to the war in Iraq.Sadly, troops are turned away when they protest at the Capitol. A mother is turned away from seeing her son's grave in the Arlington cemetery.  (just like now, 40 families of people who died in the Iraq war were turned away from Bush's State of the Union/ but supporters of the war got great seats and some PR moments).The Nixon Administration does not like the veterans against the war so he takes John O'Neill and some other Vietnam war vets who are pro-war and forms a ""counter group"". This group is called ""Vietnam Vets for a Just Peace"" - today this group is Swift Boat Vets. Swift Boat Vets were funded heavily from the Texas GOP during the 2004 election but for some reason this didn't cause outrage. Do you see a pattern??This movie is very emotional and I cried a few times. The parallels to our current war in Iraq were amazing.

858635,ABE8YHLYSM15G,B000646MMA,Luke Killion,"[2, 3]","""Going up River"" is a short 88 minute documentary on Massachusetts Senator and former presidential candidate John Kerry. Although it is obviously pro-Kerry in the election year of 2004, I found that many of the men he served with testified to the strength of his character and leadership underfire, giving it substantial credibility.  It is the answer to the 2004 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth smear campaign against Kerry that focused on a small number of men who also served in the ""brown water navy"" in the Mekong Delta and on the coast. The crew which Kerry commanded on his small patrol craft would go on the record and coroborate the commendations that Kerry recieved, which the SBVT claimed were ""exaggerated.""This controversy stems all the way back to the Nixon era, as this film reveals portions of Nixon's secret recordings where he recognizes Kerry as a strong speaker and a definate ""Kennedy"" type, making him a formidable opponent. Kerry's appearings before a congressional commitee as spokesman for the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) features prominently in this doc, and brought Kerry to national status overnight, prompting Nixon to arrange John O'Neill, another Naval officer loyal to the war effort to debate Kerry on the Dick Cavett show.  O'Neill would later be one of Kerry's largest detractors in the 2004 campaign, which evidences the truism that politicians have long memories. Many members the the George W. Bush administration got their start under Nixon, with VP Cheney and Defense Sec. Rumsfeld among them. They clearly had not forgotten Kerry's leadership of ""long haired communist sympathizers"", who were believed to be traitors to the US.This film is mainly concerned with Kerry's decision to speak out against a war that almost every veteran felt was unwinnable and mismanaged. Though most of the film concerns Kerry's activism in the VVAW, it is a good picture of the man's early life, as it begins with a brief telling of Kerry's childhood and college years, attending St. Paul's in New Hampshire, then Yale.  Kerry was obviously very much affected by the Kennedys and his entrance into Massachusetts politics in the 1980's was directly under the guidance of Ted Kennedy (though this film only covers the first 30 years of his life). The relevance of this movie shows the divisions in American society that started with the assassination of President Kennedy, the hasty entrance into a war 13,000 miles away little more than a year later and civil rights issues. The men that Kerry represented were full of anger when they returned home at the propaganda that surrounded Vietnam and the disparity between the fiction presented to the US public and the reality of the war over seas. This led to some excesses within the anti-war movement, among them the SDS radicals and the Weathermen who advocated for armed resistance and overthrow of the government. To many people, the VVAW and the SDS type groups were one in the same, but as many veterans pointed out, they are not. In his own words, Kerry states that the protests he led in April of 1971 were designed to stop the unecessary violence, not create more of it. Needless to say, any scholar of the Vietnam era knows that hard feelings were born on both sides, ones that carried over into the next generation. Kerry's 2004 campaign was seriously damaged by the Swift Boat Veterans, who through massive publicity spin, turned  a man who could've easily obtained a deferment into a traitor, because he believed in speaking the truth rather than hiding the reality from the public.  Though Kerry nearly rose to the highest office in the country, his life and work are reminders of the vicious internal conflicts in Cold war America that still cause reprecussions today.",3,Solid documentary on Kerry as soldier and philosophical VVAW leader,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,3761,"['Going', 'up', 'River', 'short', '88', 'minute', 'documentary', 'Massachusetts', 'Senator', 'former', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'John', 'Kerry', 'obviously', 'pro-Kerry', 'election', 'year', '2004', 'found', 'many', 'men', 'served', 'testified', 'strength', 'character', 'leadership', 'underfire', 'giving', 'substantial', 'credibility', 'answer', '2004', 'Swift', 'Boat', 'Veterans', 'Truth', 'smear', 'campaign', 'Kerry', 'focused', 'small', 'number', 'men', 'who', 'also', 'served', 'brown', 'water', 'navy', 'Mekong', 'Delta', 'coast', 'crew', 'Kerry', 'commanded', 'small', 'patrol', 'craft', 'would', 'go', 'record', 'coroborate', 'commendations', 'Kerry', 'recieved', 'SBVT', 'claimed', 'were', 'exaggerated', 'controversy', 'way', 'back', 'Nixon', 'era', 'film', 'portions', 'Nixon', 'secret', 'recordings', 'where', 'Kerry', 'strong', 'speaker', 'definate', 'Kennedy', 'type', 'making', 'formidable', 'opponent', 'Kerry', 'appearings', 'congressional', 'commitee', 'spokesman', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'VVAW', 'prominently', 'doc', 'brought', 'Kerry', 'national', 'status', 'overnight', 'prompting', 'Nixon', 'arrange', 'John', ""O'Neill"", 'Naval', 'officer', 'loyal', 'war', 'effort', 'debate', 'Kerry', 'Dick', 'Cavett', 'show', ""O'Neill"", 'would', 'later', 'be', 'one', 'Kerry', 'largest', 'detractors', '2004', 'campaign', 'truism', 'politicians', 'have', 'long', 'memories', 'Many', 'members', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'administration', 'got', 'start', 'Nixon', 'VP', 'Cheney', 'Defense', 'Sec', 'Rumsfeld', 'clearly', 'had', 'not', 'forgotten', 'Kerry', 'leadership', 'long', 'haired', 'communist', 'sympathizers', 'who', 'were', 'believed', 'be', 'traitors', 'US.This', 'film', 'mainly', 'concerned', 'Kerry', 'decision', 'speak', 'out', 'war', 'almost', 'veteran', 'felt', 'was', 'unwinnable', 'mismanaged', 'most', 'film', 'concerns', 'Kerry', 'activism', 'VVAW', 'good', 'picture', 'man', 'early', 'life', 'brief', 'telling', 'Kerry', 'childhood', 'college', 'years', 'attending', 'St.', 'Paul', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'then', 'Yale', 'Kerry', 'was', 'obviously', 'very', 'much', 'affected', 'Kennedys', 'entrance', 'Massachusetts', 'politics', '1980', 'was', 'directly', 'guidance', 'Ted', 'Kennedy', 'film', 'only', 'first', '30', 'years', 'life', 'relevance', 'movie', 'divisions', 'American', 'society', 'started', 'assassination', 'President', 'Kennedy', 'hasty', 'entrance', 'war', '13,000', 'miles', 'away', 'little', 'more', 'year', 'later', 'civil', 'rights', 'issues', 'men', 'Kerry', 'represented', 'were', 'full', 'anger', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'propaganda', 'surrounded', 'Vietnam', 'disparity', 'fiction', 'presented', 'US', 'public', 'reality', 'war', 'seas', 'led', 'excesses', 'anti-war', 'movement', 'SDS', 'radicals', 'Weathermen', 'who', 'advocated', 'armed', 'resistance', 'overthrow', 'government', 'many', 'people', 'VVAW', 'SDS', 'type', 'groups', 'were', 'one', 'same', 'many', 'veterans', 'pointed', 'out', 'are', 'not', 'own', 'words', 'Kerry', 'protests', 'led', 'April', '1971', 'were', 'designed', 'stop', 'unecessary', 'violence', 'not', 'create', 'more', 'Needless', 'say', 'scholar', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'hard', 'feelings', 'were', 'born', 'sides', 'ones', 'carried', 'next', 'generation', 'Kerry', '2004', 'campaign', 'was', 'seriously', 'damaged', 'Swift', 'Boat', 'Veterans', 'who', 'massive', 'publicity', 'spin', 'turned', 'man', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'easily', 'obtained', 'deferment', 'traitor', 'believed', 'speaking', 'truth', 'rather', 'hiding', 'reality', 'public', 'Kerry', 'nearly', 'rose', 'highest', 'office', 'country', 'life', 'work', 'are', 'reminders', 'vicious', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Cold', 'war', 'America', 'still', 'cause', 'reprecussions', 'today']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry

The film was made by George Butler, a documentarian best known for his 1977 film ""Pumping Iron"", that introduced the public to Arnold Schwarzenegger, and  2000's award-winning ""The Endurance: Shakleton's Legendary Anarctic Expedition"". Butler is a 40-year friend of Kerry's, who worked for Kerry in 1969 and co-edited ""The New Soldier"", a book about the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, with him, so this film does not pretend to be an unbiased account. Butler admires Kerry, and ""Going Upriver"" focuses on Kerry at his most charismatic and well-spoken, when he entered the public eye as an anti-war activist in 1971.Classmates, fellow Senators, historians, Vietnam veterans, and  journalists narrate Kerry's experience as a swift boat captain, patrolling inland waterways in Vietnam, and explain the policies and purpose of the boats' missions. It was apparently the military's ""free fire zone"" strategy that most soured Kerry on the War. This was the tactic of declaring an area a ""free fire zone"" from which all Vietnamese must be cleared or killed without clearly identifying them. There is a surprising amount of film footage of Kerry and other swift boat personnel in Vietnam. I was struck by how much photographed the War was.Kerry joined ""Vietnam Veterans Against the War"" upon his return from Vietnam in 1969. ""Going Upriver"" focuses on his organization of the very successful ""Dewey Canyon III"" event in 1971, which thrust Kerry into the public eye from which he has never retired. Thousands of Vietnam veterans gathered on the Mall in Washington, D.C. to petition Congress to withdraw the United States from Vietnam and to rally the public to their cause. It was during this time that Kerry testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We see the testimony that made Kerry an instant celebrity when it was originally televised. Whenever he spoke, the 27-year-old Kerry was articulate, charismatic, and demonstrated considerable leadership ability. It is no wonder that even Senators listened to him.At times I found it disappointing that ""Going Upriver"" doesn't directly address the accusations and criticism leveled at Kerry by John O'Neill in his book ""Unfit for Command"". But the film accomplishes what it sets out to do. It shows Kerry at his most impressive, the man who persuaded a nation that ending the war in Vietnam was imperative, and it makes the audience understand the personal and political forces that shaped his career. Instead of arguing with O'Neill point-for-point, ""Going Upriver"" includes audio tapes of President Nixon and Chuck Colson talking about recruiting O'Neill to ""destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader"". Paranoid and dictatorial, but ironically funny in light of Nader's 2004 presidential bid. There is some brief footage of Kerry and O'Neill facing off on television, but I would have liked to hear more from both of them.The DVD: There is a theatrical trailer and a ""Director Profile"", which is a 4-page text bio for director George Butler.",4,Naval Officer & Anti-War Activist: Kerry's Formative Years.,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,3213,"['Going', 'Upriver', 'documents', 'experiences', 'Vietnam', 'era', 'current', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'Senator', 'John', 'Kerry', 'shaped', 'personal', 'political', 'life', 'point', 'forward', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'George', 'Butler', 'documentarian', 'best', 'known', '1977', 'film', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'introduced', 'public', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', '2000', 'award-winning', 'Endurance', 'Shakleton', 'Legendary', 'Anarctic', 'Expedition', 'Butler', '40-year', 'friend', 'Kerry', 'who', 'worked', 'Kerry', '1969', 'co-edited', 'New', 'Soldier', 'book', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'so', 'film', 'not', 'pretend', 'be', 'unbiased', 'account', 'Butler', 'Kerry', 'Going', 'Upriver', 'Kerry', 'most', 'charismatic', 'well-spoken', 'when', 'entered', 'public', 'eye', 'anti-war', 'activist', '1971.Classmates', 'fellow', 'Senators', 'historians', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'journalists', 'narrate', 'Kerry', 'experience', 'swift', 'boat', 'captain', 'patrolling', 'inland', 'waterways', 'Vietnam', 'explain', 'policies', 'purpose', 'boats', 'missions', 'was', 'apparently', 'military', 'free', 'fire', 'zone', 'strategy', 'most', 'soured', 'Kerry', 'War', 'was', 'tactic', 'declaring', 'area', 'free', 'fire', 'zone', 'Vietnamese', 'must', 'be', 'cleared', 'killed', 'clearly', 'identifying', 'surprising', 'amount', 'film', 'footage', 'Kerry', 'other', 'swift', 'boat', 'personnel', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'struck', 'how', 'much', 'photographed', 'War', 'was.Kerry', 'joined', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'return', 'Vietnam', '1969', 'Going', 'Upriver', 'organization', 'very', 'successful', 'Dewey', 'Canyon', 'III', 'event', '1971', 'thrust', 'Kerry', 'public', 'eye', 'never', 'retired', 'Thousands', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'gathered', 'Mall', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'petition', 'Congress', 'withdraw', 'United', 'States', 'Vietnam', 'rally', 'public', 'cause', 'was', 'time', 'Kerry', 'testified', 'Senate', 'Foreign', 'Relations', 'Committee', 'see', 'testimony', 'made', 'Kerry', 'instant', 'celebrity', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'televised', 'Whenever', 'spoke', '27-year-old', 'Kerry', 'was', 'articulate', 'charismatic', 'demonstrated', 'considerable', 'leadership', 'ability', 'wonder', 'even', 'Senators', 'listened', 'him.At', 'times', 'found', 'disappointing', 'Going', 'Upriver', ""n't"", 'directly', 'address', 'accusations', 'criticism', 'leveled', 'Kerry', 'John', ""O'Neill"", 'book', 'Unfit', 'Command', 'film', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'Kerry', 'most', 'impressive', 'man', 'who', 'persuaded', 'nation', 'ending', 'war', 'Vietnam', 'was', 'imperative', 'audience', 'understand', 'personal', 'political', 'forces', 'shaped', 'career', 'Instead', 'arguing', ""O'Neill"", 'point-for-point', 'Going', 'Upriver', 'audio', 'tapes', 'President', 'Nixon', 'Chuck', 'Colson', 'talking', 'recruiting', ""O'Neill"", 'destroy', 'young', 'demagogue', 'Ralph', 'Nader', 'Paranoid', 'dictatorial', 'ironically', 'funny', 'light', 'Nader', '2004', 'presidential', 'bid', 'brief', 'footage', 'Kerry', ""O'Neill"", 'facing', 'off', 'television', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'hear', 'more', 'them.The', 'DVD', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Director', 'Profile', '4-page', 'text', 'bio', 'director', 'George', 'Butler']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry

Kerry also deserves a medal for the effort he made to stop that crime of aggression.  I've purchased several copies of this film and have sent them to US soldiers in Iraq who feel our country is on another unjust mission.  The feedback I receive is interesting, with many expressing resentment towards Kerry bashers like Sean Hannity and Paul O'Neil.I voted for Kerry, but I sent money to Ralph Nader's campaign because Nader does such a great job of challenging both wings of the establishment.  In one scene of ""Going Upriver,"" Nixon and his associates are sitting around talking about how they can undercut Kerry, because they said, ""we don't want him to become another Nader.""  I thought that was a revealing moment.  With private ownership of our voting machines, I don't doubt that some votes for Kerry and Nader went down some Diebold rabbit hole.People who are interested in learning more about how the corporatists craft their propaganda will want to also check out the documentaries, ""Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media,"" ""The Corporation,"" and Eugene Jarecki's ""Why We Fight.""

858639,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B000646MMA,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[30, 36]","At a time when the allegedly liberal mass media was trying to convince itself that soldiers enjoyed dying for a fabricated war, John Kerry and Vietnam Veterans Against the War brought a needed element of truth to the American people.By this time, they had grown weary with their public officials, but still wondered if opposing the war would be an insult to their families and friends. Could they support these people while opposing the war they were forced to fight in?Having seen casualties of war for themselves, the soldiers were just as anxious (if not more so than the civilian protestors) to leave Vietnam. Precisely because of their battlefield-earned conscience, these men resented right-wing portrayal of the war as being 'good' and 'just'. They also knew a nation which sends troops only to be slaughtered forfeits the right to a serious discussion on ethics and justice.Since my generation now faces similar conditions in Iraq, I found this DVD especially moving.What only might have been a history lesson a year ago is obviously upgraded to a current events resource. Instead of conceding Kerry only documented what other soldiers were previously found guilty of, the modern day right wing is attempting to fabricate history for their own means.Unlike Michael Moore's much-ballyhooed Fahrenheit 9//11, this movie flows very linear---and would be enjoyable for a broad audience spectrum. In addition to a good format, the film is also blessed with a great message.Activism which challenges the government's official public statement is hard, but it is important. Kerry eventually sat on the other side of the Senate committee table where he once gave testimony, but he always has a passion for helping other people and thus making America a better place. Even when I don't always agree with Kerry, I am assured that I will not be called a terrorist.Both the issue-specific content and release context of this DVD make it very atypical election outreach material. Viewers are intentionally encouraged to leave each viewing with many more thoughts than prompted through the prototypical television campaign advertisements and personal appearances.Whether you want to know Kerry better or celebrate real character and ethical values in your next President, this is a great product.",5,He IS the real deal,1098230400,"10 20, 2004",2004,2290,"['time', 'when', 'allegedly', 'liberal', 'mass', 'media', 'was', 'trying', 'convince', 'soldiers', 'enjoyed', 'dying', 'fabricated', 'war', 'John', 'Kerry', 'Vietnam', 'Veterans', 'Against', 'War', 'brought', 'needed', 'element', 'truth', 'American', 'people.By', 'time', 'had', 'grown', 'weary', 'public', 'officials', 'still', 'wondered', 'opposing', 'war', 'would', 'be', 'insult', 'families', 'friends', 'Could', 'support', 'people', 'opposing', 'war', 'were', 'forced', 'fight', 'Having', 'seen', 'casualties', 'war', 'soldiers', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'anxious', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'civilian', 'protestors', 'leave', 'Vietnam', 'Precisely', 'battlefield-earned', 'conscience', 'men', 'resented', 'right-wing', 'portrayal', 'war', 'being', ""'good"", ""'just"", 'also', 'knew', 'nation', 'only', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'right', 'serious', 'discussion', 'ethics', 'justice.Since', 'generation', 'now', 'similar', 'conditions', 'Iraq', 'found', 'DVD', 'especially', 'only', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'history', 'lesson', 'year', 'ago', 'obviously', 'upgraded', 'current', 'events', 'resource', 'Instead', 'conceding', 'Kerry', 'only', 'documented', 'what', 'other', 'soldiers', 'were', 'previously', 'found', 'guilty', 'modern', 'day', 'right', 'wing', 'attempting', 'fabricate', 'history', 'own', 'means.Unlike', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'much-ballyhooed', 'Fahrenheit', '9//11', 'movie', 'very', 'linear', '-and', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'broad', 'audience', 'spectrum', 'addition', 'good', 'format', 'film', 'also', 'blessed', 'great', 'message.Activism', 'government', 'official', 'public', 'statement', 'hard', 'important', 'Kerry', 'eventually', 'sat', 'other', 'side', 'Senate', 'committee', 'table', 'where', 'once', 'gave', 'testimony', 'always', 'passion', 'helping', 'other', 'people', 'thus', 'making', 'America', 'better', 'place', 'Even', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'agree', 'Kerry', 'am', 'assured', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'called', 'terrorist.Both', 'issue-specific', 'content', 'release', 'context', 'DVD', 'make', 'very', 'atypical', 'election', 'material', 'Viewers', 'are', 'intentionally', 'encouraged', 'leave', 'viewing', 'many', 'more', 'thoughts', 'prompted', 'prototypical', 'television', 'campaign', 'advertisements', 'personal', 'appearances.Whether', 'want', 'know', 'Kerry', 'better', 'celebrate', 'real', 'character', 'ethical', 'values', 'next', 'President', 'great', 'product']",Going Upriver - The Long War of John Kerry
