1225928,ABNPNMB2U63O0,B001P7YD7I,B Leuri,"[40, 44]","I've got a very eclectic taste, and buy quite a few multi-packs.It's rare for a multipack to have four very good films, maybe not blockbuster status, but good. That's a fair description here.If you like romance or romantic comedy there's not one of these that will dissappoint.Without giving too much away I'd place them as follows:Message in a bottle was the best of the bunch, a personal opinion only, as it involved both detective work and sailing, it rated as close to 5 stars as can be given. Costner's performance was the only bit that left just a fraction to be desired. It has a somewhat surreal subplot/message that nothing we ever do is gone for good, that life finds it's way to completing the circle.Night's in Rodanthe and a Walk to Remember are both great for a rainy afternoon or stormy evening. Sofa, ice-cream, brownies and turn off the phone. 4 stars and 3 stars respectively, but only just 4 and should perhaps be more than 3.The Notebook is possibly the least desired of the bunch personally, I'm not one who's so big on movies containing lots of flashbacks or based around them, but the acting, especially Garner's and storyline are still easily good enough to make it worth watching more than once. This was a case of where Costner lowered the overall quality of ""Message"" slightly, this one just wouldn't have worked without the ageing Garner.It's a good set, in a nice box, delivered quickly and absolutely enjoyed. There were no issues with quality or getting them to play in either of our players.More details would spoil the movies so if you like this genere, invest and watch.You'll possibly enjoy the investment as much as I did.",4,Great bunch of movies for the price,1323820800,"12 14, 2011",2011,1658,"[""'ve"", 'got', 'very', 'eclectic', 'taste', 'buy', 'quite', 'few', 'multi-packs.It', 'rare', 'multipack', 'have', 'four', 'very', 'good', 'films', 'maybe', 'not', 'blockbuster', 'status', 'good', 'fair', 'description', 'here.If', 'like', 'romance', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'not', 'one', 'will', 'dissappoint.Without', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', ""'d"", 'place', 'Message', 'bottle', 'was', 'best', 'bunch', 'personal', 'opinion', 'only', 'involved', 'detective', 'work', 'sailing', 'rated', 'close', '5', 'stars', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'Costner', 'performance', 'was', 'only', 'bit', 'left', 'just', 'fraction', 'be', 'desired', 'somewhat', 'surreal', 'subplot/message', 'nothing', 'ever', 'do', 'gone', 'good', 'life', 'way', 'completing', 'circle.Night', 'Rodanthe', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'are', 'great', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'stormy', 'evening', 'Sofa', 'ice-cream', 'brownies', 'turn', 'off', 'phone', '4', 'stars', '3', 'stars', 'respectively', 'only', 'just', '4', 'should', 'perhaps', 'be', 'more', '3.The', 'Notebook', 'possibly', 'least', 'desired', 'bunch', 'personally', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'who', 'so', 'big', 'movies', 'containing', 'lots', 'flashbacks', 'based', 'acting', 'especially', 'Garner', 'storyline', 'are', 'still', 'easily', 'good', 'enough', 'make', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'once', 'was', 'case', 'where', 'Costner', 'lowered', 'overall', 'quality', 'Message', 'slightly', 'one', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'worked', 'ageing', 'Garner.It', 'good', 'set', 'nice', 'box', 'delivered', 'quickly', 'absolutely', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'issues', 'quality', 'getting', 'play', 'players.More', 'details', 'would', 'spoil', 'movies', 'so', 'like', 'genere', 'invest', 'watch.You', ""'ll"", 'possibly', 'enjoy', 'investment', 'as', 'much', 'did']",Nicholas Sparks Film Collection: (Nights in Rodanthe / The Notebook / Message in a Bottle / A Walk to Remember)

1225967,A2PI38SNDNI13F,B001P7YD7I,Taylor J. Huston,"[0, 0]","Even though I am not much of a romance reader I really love Nicholas Sparks' work.  &#34;The Notebook&#34; is by far my most favorite from him.  I even loved the movie that was made in 2004 of the novel.  And I also loved other adaptions like &#34;A Walk To Remember&#34; and &#34;Message in a Bottle&#34;.  However, I never really did see &#34;Nights in Rodanthe&#34;.  But the other three films were just amazingly created.I never felt so emotional about romance novels or movies before.  I was always the action-adventure type of guy.  But then I saw the movie &#34;The Notebook&#34; and that was when I was introduced to Nicholas Sparks.  I watched the other adaptions and I just really like them for some reason.  I later figured out that the reason I love them is because I find myself rooting for the couples in the movies and novels.  I just care about these characters and I really want them to be together, like as if it is the end of the world if they don't get together in the end.What else can say?  These movies are full of romance that they will leave you with goose-bumps and your heart pounding for more.  I say buy it.  That includes you husbands and boyfriends out there!  Get your true love something like this and I promise you that there will be plenty of kisses to go around.  ;)This is worth buying and I'll leave it at that!",5,These are great adaptions to Nicholas Sparks' greatest novels!,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",2013,1349,"['Even', 'am', 'not', 'much', 'romance', 'reader', 'really', 'love', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'work', '34', 'Notebook', '34', 'far', 'most', 'favorite', 'even', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2004', 'novel', 'also', 'loved', 'other', 'adaptions', '34', 'Walk', 'Remember', '34', '34', 'Message', 'Bottle', '34', 'However', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'see', '34', 'Nights', 'Rodanthe', '34', 'other', 'three', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'amazingly', 'created.I', 'never', 'felt', 'so', 'emotional', 'romance', 'novels', 'movies', 'was', 'always', 'action-adventure', 'type', 'guy', 'then', 'saw', 'movie', '34', 'Notebook', '34', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'introduced', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'watched', 'other', 'adaptions', 'just', 'really', 'reason', 'later', 'figured', 'out', 'reason', 'love', 'find', 'rooting', 'couples', 'movies', 'novels', 'just', 'care', 'characters', 'really', 'want', 'be', 'together', 'end', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'together', 'end.What', 'else', 'can', 'say', 'movies', 'are', 'full', 'romance', 'will', 'leave', 'goose-bumps', 'heart', 'pounding', 'more', 'say', 'buy', 'husbands', 'out', 'there', 'Get', 'true', 'love', 'something', 'promise', 'will', 'be', 'plenty', 'kisses', 'go', 'around', 'worth', 'buying', ""'ll"", 'leave']",Nicholas Sparks Film Collection: (Nights in Rodanthe / The Notebook / Message in a Bottle / A Walk to Remember)
