Jay has now completed his 5th Symohony (198 pages) which was written at the age of thirteen. It has been recorded for Sony BMG in the same studios where the Beatles' songs were recorded. This fifth composition was played by the London Symphony Orchestra in England,He was not your normal twelve year old, not interested in sports. He was bored to distraction in history class. He sees music as a hobby, and not his destiny. He hears the music in his head at the speed of light. He hums what's channeled to him as he walks. He is the musical Einstein.At the age of ten, he enrolled at Julliard. Now, at the age of fourteen, he is a 3rd year college student. Jay need to question his 'gift' like Beethoven and studies piano lessons. He played cello at the age of three. He had started writing music at the age of two. His mother is Israli and father lost his sight at the age of 36.At twelve years, he became known as a musical prodigy and declares that ""it comes right the first time."" He writes the music for each instrument of the orchestra even though he has not played them. He write ""when I am inspired;"" when one long session is completed, he starts another immediately. I fear he will burn out before he reaches twenty. He writes what he has imagined and when asked ""who can really define happiness"" he answers ""keeping one's mind challenged.""This was a good documentary filmed both in America and Britain as he takes his bows after the performance of his 5th Symphony. He may know music, but I would advise him to change his mind about history, as that is where we come from and is to be the result of our family heritage and genes as to what his future holds for him. He is an inspiration to all.",3,A Musical Genius,1164672000,"11 28, 2006",2006,1752,"['Blue', 'Devils', 'never', 'sounded', 'so', 'good', 'Jay', 'now', 'completed', '5th', 'Symohony', '198', 'pages', 'was', 'written', 'age', 'thirteen', 'been', 'recorded', 'Sony', 'BMG', 'same', 'studios', 'where', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'were', 'recorded', 'fifth', 'composition', 'was', 'played', 'London', 'Symphony', 'Orchestra', 'England', 'was', 'not', 'normal', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'interested', 'sports', 'was', 'bored', 'distraction', 'history', 'class', 'music', 'hobby', 'not', 'destiny', 'music', 'head', 'speed', 'light', 'hums', 'what', 'channeled', 'musical', 'Einstein.At', 'age', 'ten', 'enrolled', 'Julliard', 'Now', 'age', 'fourteen', '3rd', 'year', 'college', 'student', 'Jay', 'need', 'question', ""'gift"", 'Beethoven', 'studies', 'piano', 'lessons', 'played', 'cello', 'age', 'three', 'had', 'started', 'writing', 'music', 'age', 'two', 'mother', 'Israli', 'father', 'lost', 'sight', 'age', '36.At', 'twelve', 'years', 'became', 'known', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'music', 'instrument', 'orchestra', 'even', 'not', 'played', 'when', 'am', 'inspired', 'when', 'one', 'long', 'session', 'completed', 'immediately', 'fear', 'will', 'burn', 'out', 'twenty', 'what', 'imagined', 'when', 'asked', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'define', 'happiness', 'keeping', 'one', 'mind', 'challenged', 'was', 'good', 'documentary', 'filmed', 'America', 'Britain', 'bows', 'performance', '5th', 'Symphony', 'may', 'know', 'music', 'would', 'advise', 'change', 'mind', 'history', 'where', 'come', 'be', 'result', 'family', 'heritage', 'genes', 'what', 'future', 'inspiration']",N/A

(Later Boss Tom Pendergast would launch a former local haberdasher into politics: Harry S. Truman). Whatever else was happening, jazz was certainly thriving, and a host of musicians like Basie and Turner used the time and place to advance and perfect their individual gifts.

665097,A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B00005M2CK,"Mike Tarrani ""Jazz Drummer""","[1, 1]","Although not released until the late 1970s, this video was filmed in 1974, approximately a year or two afterBorn to Swing: Movie About the Alumni of the Count [VHS] was shot.The film may seem unstructured and meandering (and it is), the true value is we are witnessing an oral history from the lips of key players and creators of the Kansas City jazz sub genre. ""Jazz"" is probably a misnomer because most of the music coming from Kansas City during that era was based on twelve bar blues. Indeed, every musician who migrated from Kansas City and made an indelible mark on jazz as a whole were as much blues musicians as they were jazz musicians.While this is an oral history, it also contains performances. Actually, this reminds me of Jelly Roll Morton'sThe Complete Library of Congress Recordings, except there is no character to fill Alan Lomax's role as interviewer, and we are experiencing video instead of sound recordings. Perhaps that is stretching it, but the net effect is this film does provide a glimpse into the musicianship as well as the characters of the musicians. And among them are some key keaders, including Jay McShann, Basie, and others. I cited McShann and Basie because they both can be traced directly back to the beginning, which arguably started in Oklahoma City with Walter Page's Blue Devils, and parallel groundwork in Kansas City by Bennie Moten. Indeed, Moten seems to be a key and of all of the Kansas City leaders probably the only one who was actually a Kansas City native!I especially loved the performance portions because they included Night Train by its composer - Jimmy Forrest - and clips showing drummers Ernie Williams, Papa Jo Jones and Baby Lovett in action. Jo Jones was (and remains to this day) one of the most influential drummers in jazz history. He single-handedly developed the vocabularies for brush and hi-playing. However, the highlight for me was seeing Baby Lovett. The reasons are that I have many hours of Jo Jones clips, but this is the first I ever saw of Lovett, and Jo Jones had mentioned him in an album about drum styles.Suffice to say, this is important to music historians in the same way that any recording - audio or video - of pioneering musicians are to understanding the persons and their music through firsthand observation. The video is not a scientifically conducted oral history, but it still remains a part of the oral record and only time will tell just how important it is. In the meantime, it is available to enjoy and study casually.",5,Important historical document,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2515,"['not', 'released', 'late', '1970s', 'video', 'was', 'filmed', '1974', 'approximately', 'year', 'two', 'afterBorn', 'Swing', 'Movie', 'Alumni', 'Count', '[', 'VHS', ']', 'was', 'shot.The', 'film', 'may', 'seem', 'unstructured', 'meandering', 'true', 'value', 'are', 'witnessing', 'oral', 'history', 'lips', 'key', 'players', 'creators', 'Kansas', 'City', 'jazz', 'sub', 'genre', 'Jazz', 'probably', 'misnomer', 'most', 'music', 'coming', 'Kansas', 'City', 'era', 'was', 'based', 'twelve', 'bar', 'blues', 'Indeed', 'musician', 'who', 'migrated', 'Kansas', 'City', 'made', 'indelible', 'mark', 'jazz', 'whole', 'were', 'as', 'much', 'blues', 'musicians', 'were', 'jazz', 'musicians.While', 'oral', 'history', 'also', 'performances', 'Actually', 'Jelly', 'Roll', ""Morton'sThe"", 'Complete', 'Library', 'Congress', 'Recordings', 'character', 'fill', 'Alan', 'Lomax', 'role', 'interviewer', 'are', 'experiencing', 'video', 'instead', 'sound', 'recordings', 'Perhaps', 'stretching', 'net', 'effect', 'film', 'provide', 'glimpse', 'musicianship', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'musicians', 'are', 'key', 'keaders', 'including', 'Jay', 'McShann', 'Basie', 'others', 'cited', 'McShann', 'Basie', 'can', 'be', 'traced', 'directly', 'back', 'beginning', 'arguably', 'started', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'Walter', 'Page', 'Blue', 'Devils', 'parallel', 'groundwork', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Bennie', 'Moten', 'Indeed', 'Moten', 'be', 'key', 'Kansas', 'City', 'leaders', 'probably', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'was', 'actually', 'Kansas', 'City', 'native', 'especially', 'loved', 'performance', 'portions', 'included', 'Night', 'Train', 'composer', 'Jimmy', 'Forrest', 'clips', 'showing', 'drummers', 'Ernie', 'Williams', 'Papa', 'Jo', 'Jones', 'Baby', 'Lovett', 'action', 'Jo', 'Jones', 'was', 'day', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'drummers', 'jazz', 'history', 'single-handedly', 'developed', 'vocabularies', 'brush', 'hi-playing', 'However', 'highlight', 'was', 'seeing', 'Baby', 'Lovett', 'reasons', 'are', 'have', 'many', 'hours', 'Jo', 'Jones', 'clips', 'first', 'ever', 'saw', 'Lovett', 'Jo', 'Jones', 'had', 'mentioned', 'album', 'drum', 'styles.Suffice', 'say', 'important', 'music', 'historians', 'same', 'way', 'recording', 'audio', 'video', 'pioneering', 'musicians', 'are', 'understanding', 'persons', 'music', 'firsthand', 'observation', 'video', 'not', 'scientifically', 'conducted', 'oral', 'history', 'still', 'part', 'oral', 'record', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'meantime', 'available', 'enjoy', 'study', 'casually']",N/A

But, I don't care; first of all, there's enough of information AND, much more importantly , there's so much, much fabulous music here, with so much jazz, blues and bluesy jazz, that I'd like to recommend this DVD very warmly both to the seasoned jazz fans and to the jazz novices, who would liek to see what it's all about... AND it's about the reunion of jazz masters after 40 yeas in a club they used to gig, it's about Joe Turner wailing (he can be cool and low down dirty at the same time; very few could pull that), Jay McShann on piano, and singing (he had a very much welcome resurge of carreer at that stage of life), plus a Count Basie big band birthday party, with magnificent music (and often short or less short statements) by Eddie Durham, Claude Williams, Budd Johnson, Jimmy Forrest, jesse price, Crook Goodwin, Paul Quinichette, Charles McPHarson, Gene Ramey, Buddy Lovett, Jo Jones and many, many others (as you can see, there are cats of various generations and jazz/blues substyles here).Camerawork is OK, with split screen (like in the famous Woodstock documentary) contributing somewhat to the dynamism of the whole affair.Although Basie orchestra is top class, with ole' reliable Freddie Green playing rhythm(with Eric Dixon, Bobby Platter, Al Grey, Curtis Fuller, etc. etc.), and live, which is also fine,but Jay McShann (piano and vocal) and Joe Turner (vocal) steel the show,giving some of the meanest blues/jazz performances that camera has ever filmed.",5,Some real jazz and blues I'm tellin ya',1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,1597,"['will', 'probably', 'complain', 'lack', 'structured', 'info', 'golden', 'era', 'Kansas', 'City', '1979.', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'first', 'enough', 'information', 'AND', 'much', 'more', 'importantly', 'so', 'much', 'much', 'fabulous', 'music', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'jazz', 'blues', 'bluesy', 'jazz', ""'d"", 'like', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'very', 'warmly', 'seasoned', 'jazz', 'fans', 'jazz', 'novices', 'who', 'would', 'liek', 'see', 'what', 'reunion', 'jazz', 'masters', '40', 'yeas', 'club', 'used', 'gig', 'Joe', 'Turner', 'wailing', 'can', 'be', 'cool', 'low', 'down', 'dirty', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'few', 'could', 'pull', 'Jay', 'McShann', 'piano', 'singing', 'had', 'very', 'much', 'welcome', 'resurge', 'carreer', 'stage', 'life', 'Count', 'Basie', 'big', 'band', 'birthday', 'party', 'magnificent', 'music', 'often', 'short', 'less', 'short', 'statements', 'Eddie', 'Durham', 'Claude', 'Williams', 'Budd', 'Johnson', 'Jimmy', 'Forrest', 'jesse', 'price', 'Crook', 'Goodwin', 'Paul', 'Quinichette', 'Charles', 'McPHarson', 'Gene', 'Ramey', 'Buddy', 'Lovett', 'Jo', 'Jones', 'many', 'many', 'others', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'cats', 'various', 'generations', 'jazz/blues', 'substyles', 'here', '.Camerawork', 'OK', 'split', 'screen', 'famous', 'Woodstock', 'documentary', 'contributing', 'somewhat', 'dynamism', 'whole', 'affair.Although', 'Basie', 'orchestra', 'top', 'class', 'ole', 'reliable', 'Freddie', 'Green', 'playing', 'rhythm', 'Eric', 'Dixon', 'Bobby', 'Platter', 'Al', 'Grey', 'Curtis', 'Fuller', 'etc', 'etc', 'live', 'also', 'fine', 'Jay', 'McShann', 'piano', 'vocal', 'Joe', 'Turner', 'vocal', 'steel', 'show', 'giving', 'meanest', 'blues/jazz', 'performances', 'camera', 'ever', 'filmed']",N/A
665099,A3N0E03AQD128O,B00005M2CK,Tony Thomas,"[24, 24]","If the people pictured in this movie were just local performers in Kansas City with no historical importance, this would still be a wonderful film. However, it isn't. We have some of the most important figures in Jazz and African American music in general, getting together, socializing and reunioning after many years. Even though most were in their seventies or older when this was done in the mid 1970s, there is incredibly lively music and social interaction. The DVD is essential because those of you who do not know who the various participants are by name, can learn a little more, although not enough.Take one performer, Eddie Durham. Durham plays one great solo on trombone on a blues number. Later he is seen discussing the change of the name of the One Oclock Jump from Blue Balls with Buster Smith. Durham played with the Bennie Moten Orchestra, the great Jimmie Lunsford band, and then with Count Basie. Durham was also the first known electric guitar player (not with Moten as the director wrongly thinks, there were no electric guitars while Moten recorded, with Moton, Basie, and Lunsford Durham used a national steel guitar and a standard acoustic guitar. His electric recordings came on the Commodore Kansas City 5 and 6 recordings.) and it was Durham who convinced Charlie Chrisitian to take up the guitar, and then the electric guitar.  But more than that, Durham as one of the greatest arrangers in the history of popular music. Moten Swing played throughout the film by Basie, a Jay McShann Group, and Moten himself was arranged by Durham, as were One Oclock Jump and Jumpin at the Woodside played by McShann and Basie, as was for Dancers Only and a host of other hits for Lunsford. The one swing tune that everyone on the planet knows, In the Mood by Glenn Miller was arranged by Eddie Durham!!!This is just one guy.What I liked best on this film was the interplay between the Great Big Joe Turner and Jay McShann on a series of blues Tunes.McShann was the last of the great black Kansas City Band leaders. He persisted as a solo and trio star in the blues business introducing singers like Lowell Fulsom and Jimmy Witherspoon, and emerged as a solo performer and leader of all star groups byu the 1980s (after going back to school and getting a conservatory degree in music along the way). Today in his 90s he is still a great performing entertainer on the piano, doing clubs, albums, concerts and cruises.You can just here Jay swelling with pride with happiness with the arrival of all of the great old stars of the KC Jazz including Count Basie himself and how the great blues moaning and playing of Joe Turner inspires him.  After the 1940s, most people rarely heard Turner recording with swing players. He was usually recorded with R &amp; B or Rock players (many see his Shake Rattle and Roll as the first big rock hit, but I go with Lawdy miss Clawdy and Rocket 88).  Here he is pared with McShann and other contemporaries from the Kansas City of the 1930s and 1940s and he b3ecomes so much more mellow, so much more powerful and is having so much fun as McShann pours the music out.The other thing is that this video presents the musicians in their real context. They are not performing for white well heeled festival goers or club goers, but in the Black musicians union hall where many of them played in the weekly &quot;Spooks Breakfast&quot; dances Basie and other held there in the 1930s to benefit the union and down and out musicians (was there much of any other kind back in the Depression?).  People are dressed fine, drinking a sweet taste of scotch or whatever, and their ladies are in attendance dressed fine too. This home.There is so much fun on this DVD that I played it three times before I got up, even though it made me late for a music gig I had that night.Listen to it, play it like a record, then get the music these fine musicians made and really have a blast!",5,"A profoundly enjoyable, profoundly important work",1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,3913,"['people', 'pictured', 'movie', 'were', 'just', 'local', 'performers', 'Kansas', 'City', 'historical', 'importance', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'wonderful', 'film', 'However', ""n't"", 'have', 'most', 'important', 'figures', 'Jazz', 'African', 'American', 'music', 'general', 'getting', 'together', 'socializing', 'reunioning', 'many', 'years', 'Even', 'most', 'were', 'seventies', 'older', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'mid', '1970s', 'incredibly', 'lively', 'music', 'social', 'interaction', 'DVD', 'essential', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'who', 'various', 'participants', 'are', 'name', 'can', 'learn', 'little', 'more', 'not', 'enough.Take', 'one', 'performer', 'Eddie', 'Durham', 'Durham', 'one', 'great', 'solo', 'trombone', 'blues', 'number', 'Later', 'seen', 'discussing', 'change', 'name', 'One', 'Oclock', 'Jump', 'Blue', 'Balls', 'Buster', 'Smith', 'Durham', 'played', 'Bennie', 'Moten', 'Orchestra', 'great', 'Jimmie', 'Lunsford', 'band', 'then', 'Count', 'Basie', 'Durham', 'was', 'also', 'first', 'known', 'electric', 'guitar', 'player', 'not', 'Moten', 'director', 'wrongly', 'were', 'electric', 'guitars', 'Moten', 'recorded', 'Moton', 'Basie', 'Lunsford', 'Durham', 'used', 'national', 'steel', 'guitar', 'standard', 'acoustic', 'guitar', 'electric', 'recordings', 'came', 'Commodore', 'Kansas', 'City', '5', '6', 'recordings', 'was', 'Durham', 'who', 'convinced', 'Charlie', 'Chrisitian', 'take', 'up', 'guitar', 'then', 'electric', 'guitar', 'more', 'Durham', 'one', 'greatest', 'arrangers', 'history', 'popular', 'music', 'Moten', 'Swing', 'played', 'film', 'Basie', 'Jay', 'McShann', 'Group', 'Moten', 'was', 'arranged', 'Durham', 'were', 'One', 'Oclock', 'Jump', 'Jumpin', 'Woodside', 'played', 'McShann', 'Basie', 'was', 'Dancers', 'Only', 'host', 'other', 'hits', 'Lunsford', 'one', 'swing', 'tune', 'everyone', 'planet', 'Mood', 'Glenn', 'Miller', 'was', 'arranged', 'Eddie', 'Durham', 'just', 'one', 'guy.What', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'was', 'interplay', 'Great', 'Big', 'Joe', 'Turner', 'Jay', 'McShann', 'series', 'blues', 'Tunes.McShann', 'was', 'last', 'great', 'black', 'Kansas', 'City', 'Band', 'leaders', 'persisted', 'solo', 'trio', 'star', 'blues', 'business', 'introducing', 'singers', 'Lowell', 'Fulsom', 'Jimmy', 'Witherspoon', 'emerged', 'solo', 'performer', 'leader', 'star', 'groups', 'byu', '1980s', 'going', 'back', 'school', 'getting', 'conservatory', 'degree', 'music', 'way', 'Today', '90s', 'still', 'great', 'performing', 'entertainer', 'piano', 'doing', 'clubs', 'albums', 'concerts', 'cruises.You', 'can', 'just', 'here', 'Jay', 'swelling', 'pride', 'happiness', 'arrival', 'great', 'old', 'stars', 'KC', 'Jazz', 'including', 'Count', 'Basie', 'how', 'great', 'blues', 'moaning', 'playing', 'Joe', 'Turner', '1940s', 'most', 'people', 'rarely', 'heard', 'Turner', 'recording', 'swing', 'players', 'was', 'usually', 'recorded', 'R', 'amp', 'B', 'Rock', 'players', 'many', 'see', 'Shake', 'Rattle', 'Roll', 'first', 'big', 'rock', 'hit', 'go', 'Lawdy', 'miss', 'Clawdy', 'Rocket', '88', 'Here', 'pared', 'McShann', 'other', 'contemporaries', 'Kansas', 'City', '1930s', '1940s', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'mellow', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'McShann', 'music', 'other', 'thing', 'video', 'musicians', 'real', 'context', 'are', 'not', 'performing', 'white', 'well', 'heeled', 'festival', 'goers', 'club', 'goers', 'Black', 'musicians', 'union', 'hall', 'where', 'many', 'played', 'weekly', 'quot', 'Spooks', 'Breakfast', 'quot', 'dances', 'Basie', 'other', 'held', 'there', '1930s', 'benefit', 'union', 'down', 'musicians', 'was', 'there', 'much', 'other', 'kind', 'back', 'Depression', 'People', 'are', 'dressed', 'fine', 'drinking', 'sweet', 'taste', 'scotch', 'whatever', 'ladies', 'are', 'attendance', 'dressed', 'fine', 'too', 'home.There', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'DVD', 'played', 'three', 'times', 'got', 'up', 'even', 'made', 'late', 'music', 'gig', 'had', 'night.Listen', 'play', 'record', 'then', 'get', 'music', 'fine', 'musicians', 'made', 'really', 'have', 'blast']",N/A
