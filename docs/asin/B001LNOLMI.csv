1215271,A1ZTIK26TACL5B,B001LNOLMI,kozmikrokker,"[3, 4]","I just watched the DVD-R version of this that I purchased from Amazon. It is typical Nigel Kneale. He has a talent for linking seemingly unrelated paranormal subjects in an interesting way. Especially for his time period. So this team of electrical engineers and tech experts moves into this old abandoned facility, and are renovating it to be used as a laboratory in order to accomplish the task of discovering a new type of recording medium as a substitute for magnetic tape.They discover one room of this building that has not been touched by the renovators. Apparently none of the work crew will go in there, they say it is haunted. We find out soon after that this building is built on top of a very old stone structure, possibly Saxon or earlier. After they accept that there is something to the room that is paranormal, the experts turn their instruments away from the project they've been working on and turn it onto the room, trying to see if they can record the ghost that a few of them have seen and most of them have heard, on tape. They begin to think that ghosts are not physical entities. They think instead that they are somehow events that the room has recorded and are capable of being played back by those who are in tune with certain natural frequencies native to the rock in the room.They never quite resolve the experiments they conduct, in fact they are forced by their research sponsor to cut them off early. The phenomena in the room seems to go dormant for a while, but then manifests to the one who first noticed it later in a way that defies what any of them had been thinking.There are some cheap but still entertaining special effects towards the end, and also the first ghost they see. The movie itself was in great shape. I don't think it has been remastered, but the image was clean with no artifacts. The sound was fine, though some of the lab equipment was quite loud compared to the rest of the soundtrack. I bought this because it is rare, and a Nigel Kneale movie. This would be a good late night movie. It really reminded me of an extended episode of the British TV show ""Thriller"". If you liked that show, you'll relate to this movie.",4,Not a bad British B movie,1316563200,"09 21, 2011",2011,2174,"['just', 'watched', 'DVD-R', 'version', 'purchased', 'Amazon', 'typical', 'Nigel', 'Kneale', 'talent', 'linking', 'seemingly', 'unrelated', 'paranormal', 'subjects', 'interesting', 'way', 'Especially', 'time', 'period', 'team', 'electrical', 'engineers', 'tech', 'experts', 'old', 'abandoned', 'facility', 'are', 'renovating', 'be', 'used', 'laboratory', 'order', 'accomplish', 'task', 'discovering', 'new', 'type', 'recording', 'medium', 'substitute', 'magnetic', 'tape.They', 'discover', 'one', 'room', 'building', 'not', 'been', 'touched', 'renovators', 'Apparently', 'none', 'work', 'crew', 'will', 'go', 'there', 'say', 'haunted', 'find', 'out', 'soon', 'building', 'built', 'top', 'very', 'old', 'stone', 'structure', 'possibly', 'Saxon', 'earlier', 'accept', 'something', 'room', 'paranormal', 'experts', 'turn', 'instruments', 'away', 'project', ""'ve"", 'been', 'working', 'turn', 'room', 'trying', 'see', 'can', 'record', 'ghost', 'few', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'have', 'heard', 'tape', 'begin', 'think', 'ghosts', 'are', 'not', 'physical', 'entities', 'think', 'instead', 'are', 'somehow', 'events', 'room', 'recorded', 'are', 'capable', 'being', 'played', 'back', 'who', 'are', 'tune', 'certain', 'natural', 'frequencies', 'native', 'rock', 'room.They', 'never', 'quite', 'resolve', 'experiments', 'conduct', 'fact', 'are', 'forced', 'research', 'sponsor', 'cut', 'off', 'early', 'phenomena', 'room', 'go', 'dormant', 'while', 'then', 'one', 'who', 'first', 'noticed', 'later', 'way', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'are', 'cheap', 'still', 'entertaining', 'special', 'effects', 'end', 'also', 'first', 'ghost', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'shape', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'been', 'remastered', 'image', 'was', 'clean', 'artifacts', 'sound', 'was', 'fine', 'lab', 'equipment', 'was', 'quite', 'loud', 'compared', 'rest', 'soundtrack', 'bought', 'rare', 'Nigel', 'Kneale', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'late', 'night', 'movie', 'really', 'reminded', 'extended', 'episode', 'British', 'TV', 'show', 'Thriller', 'liked', 'show', ""'ll"", 'relate', 'movie']",N/A

They are placed in a mansion, to give them space to work, and play, to really burn both ends of the candle to totally focus on the goal.Then one of the rooms ends up having a ghost.  At first this seems to be a problem.  Till they start looking at the ghost as data which has somehow been recorded.  Think of it - data that could be stored for a long period, with little loss of information, in a medium that could be mass produced.  The title kinds of gives that point away.  If they could just figure out how it WORKS - without having to kill people.The real horror is the last ten minutes when you realize just how old the stones are and what they really hold.  One of those - oh, I get it - moments of horror.  In other words, the female ghost is the icing.
