Right away, I knew this would be a band I would want to hear more of.Since the VH-1 show was shot at the beginning of this year, it's not out on DVD yet.  I couldn't wait, so I bought this DVD, The Corrs - Live at the Royal Albert Hall.  It is from 1998.  The quality of the sound recording is excellent!  Very clear and clean.  I'm not as impressed with the videography, though.  The director chose to have quick shots of the individuals, back and forth.  You don't really get a calm wide shot of them playing for more than a few seconds.  I realize that's on purpose, but I think they miss the point that a lot of people buy a concert DVD to see the whole show, as if you were in the audience, not looking at just another snappy video production.It's not unbearable, and it's not enough for me to say don't buy it, because I think it's good for the music alone....To summarize, if you know and like The Corrs, you need this for your collection.  If you don't know who they are, this DVD should sway you to the best thing to come out of Ireland since U2.",4,The Corrs Crank!,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",2002,1171,"['first', 'saw', 'Corrs', 'VH-1', 'few', 'months', 'back', 'had', 'heard', 'name', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'music', 'Right', 'away', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'band', 'would', 'want', 'hear', 'more', 'of.Since', 'VH-1', 'show', 'was', 'shot', 'beginning', 'year', 'not', 'out', 'DVD', 'yet', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'bought', 'DVD', 'Corrs', 'Live', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', '1998', 'quality', 'sound', 'recording', 'excellent', 'Very', 'clear', 'clean', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'videography', 'though', 'director', 'chose', 'have', 'quick', 'shots', 'individuals', 'back', 'forth', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'calm', 'wide', 'shot', 'playing', 'more', 'few', 'seconds', 'realize', 'purpose', 'think', 'miss', 'point', 'lot', 'people', 'buy', 'concert', 'DVD', 'see', 'whole', 'show', 'were', 'audience', 'not', 'looking', 'just', 'snappy', 'video', 'production.It', 'not', 'unbearable', 'not', 'enough', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'think', 'good', 'music', 'alone', '.To', 'summarize', 'know', 'Corrs', 'need', 'collection', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'are', 'DVD', 'should', 'sway', 'best', 'thing', 'come', 'Ireland', 'U2']",N/A

This was my first glimpse into the band's live performances, and I was amazed at what I saw.Filmed on St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 1998 (which, incidentally, was Caroline Corr's 25th birthday), &quot;Live at the Royal Albert Hall&quot; is full of energetic singing and a thoroughly amazing performance.It is obvious that the audience doesn't really have a clue as to who the Corrs are -- at the beginning. The Irish siblings enter with a bang, however, with the beautifully-performed 'When He's Not Around'. From there on in, the crowd is theirs, cheering them along through a great show.What shocked me is how well they play live; it's almost better than on the albums. Some of the tracks are especially poignant, including 'Hopelessly Addicted', 'What Can I Do', and 'Intimacy'. Mick Fleetwood adds his expertise on the cover of Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' (which is much better than the original), as well as the Irish instrumentals 'Haste to the Wedding' and 'Toss the Feathers'.The DVD has no special features, but that doesn't stop it from being a great addition to any collection.

The music is incredible -- a neat blend of irsh/celtic and modern pop sound.  The women in the group are gorgeous!

562876,A1CGF9EUDEUQJA,B000050IKC,Rodrigo Medina,"[22, 23]","For those who do not know, the Corrs is an irish band very popular in Europe and who is currently touring in US. They are four siblings --Andrea (leading vocals), Sharon (violin and backing vocal),Carolina (drums) and Jim (keyboard, vocals)--who have emerged as an international success around the world, heving performed in Jay Leno, Today Show and Good Morning America several times.This DVD contains an 85-minute sold-out show that rocked London's Royal Albert Hall, in St. Patrick's day (March, 17, 1998). In this very special presentation, the corrs perform some of their hits from the multi-platinium albums &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; and &quot;Forgiven, not Forgotten&quot;, both available in US market. Unfortunately, this DVD does not contain special areas or interviews, but the show makes it worth.The Corrs plays a perfect combination of pop and celtic music, being acclaimed by audiences all over the world. Here are the reviews for some songs performed in this show:&quot;No good for me&quot;- This is one of my favorite songs. It's pop and very enthusiastic. The lyrics are great.&quot;Runaway&quot;- This is one of corr's most popular songs of all times. It has a violin intro that is very pleasant. It talks about the relationship between soulmates, and how good a living with someone you love can be.&quot;Queen of Hollywood&quot;- This song is awesome! The lyrics talk about a girl fascinated with luxury and sucess, who becomes famous in hollywood, but only disappoints her parents with the destiny she gives to her life. It is deep and beautiful. Good for reflection.&quot;Dreams&quot;- This is a cover from Fleetwood Mac song, which made the corrs very popular everywhere. It is like a dance version for this classic hits, with violins and drum. It features a special participation of Mick Fleetwood in the show, playing the drums.&quot;Haste to the wedding (1+2)&quot;, &quot;Joy of Life&quot;, &quot;Toss the feathers&quot;-These songs are only instrumental, played by the whole band. It's celtic music, from the purest fountain, played by people who were raised listening to it. Amazing!&quot;Only when I sleep&quot;- This is a great moment of the show. Andrea, who was chosen one of the 50 most beautiful women in the world, perfoms acting like a naive girl, but at the same time very sexy. I love the way she looks to the audience, as if she wants to seduce them with her charm.&quot;So young&quot;- this is a very joyfull song about how good it is to be young and have a whole future in front of you. Violins and keyboard make it unforgettable.&quot;The right time&quot;- This is a song from their first CD. It's pop, with celtic tradition. Throughout the song, you listen to wonderful violin solos.&quot;I never loved you anyway&quot;- Another great track. A girl, after breaking up with her boyfriend, finds out they were very different, and she never really loved him.The other songs featured in this show are as good as the ones mentioned before. It is certainly a DVD which deserves to be purchased by those who appreciate quality.",5,A brilliant performance,976320000,"12 9, 2000",2000,3065,"['who', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Corrs', 'irish', 'band', 'very', 'popular', 'Europe', 'who', 'currently', 'touring', 'US', 'are', 'four', 'siblings', 'Andrea', 'leading', 'vocals', 'Sharon', 'violin', 'backing', 'vocal', 'Carolina', 'drums', 'Jim', 'keyboard', 'vocals', 'who', 'have', 'emerged', 'international', 'success', 'world', 'heving', 'performed', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'Today', 'Show', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'several', 'times.This', 'DVD', '85-minute', 'sold-out', 'show', 'rocked', 'London', 'Royal', 'Albert', 'Hall', 'St.', 'Patrick', 'day', 'March', '17', '1998', 'very', 'special', 'presentation', 'corrs', 'perform', 'hits', 'multi-platinium', 'albums', 'quot', 'Talk', 'Corners', 'quot', 'quot', 'Forgiven', 'not', 'Forgotten', 'quot', 'available', 'US', 'market', 'Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'not', 'contain', 'special', 'areas', 'interviews', 'show', 'worth.The', 'Corrs', 'perfect', 'combination', 'pop', 'celtic', 'music', 'being', 'acclaimed', 'audiences', 'world', 'Here', 'are', 'reviews', 'songs', 'performed', 'show', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'one', 'favorite', 'songs', 'pop', 'very', 'enthusiastic', 'lyrics', 'are', 'great.', 'quot', 'Runaway', 'quot', 'one', 'corr', 'most', 'popular', 'songs', 'times', 'violin', 'intro', 'very', 'pleasant', 'relationship', 'soulmates', 'how', 'good', 'living', 'someone', 'love', 'can', 'be.', 'quot', 'Queen', 'Hollywood', 'quot', 'song', 'awesome', 'lyrics', 'talk', 'girl', 'fascinated', 'luxury', 'sucess', 'who', 'famous', 'hollywood', 'only', 'parents', 'destiny', 'life', 'deep', 'beautiful', 'Good', 'reflection.', 'quot', 'Dreams', 'quot', 'cover', 'Fleetwood', 'Mac', 'song', 'made', 'corrs', 'very', 'popular', 'everywhere', 'dance', 'version', 'classic', 'hits', 'violins', 'drum', 'special', 'participation', 'Mick', 'Fleetwood', 'show', 'playing', 'drums.', 'quot', 'Haste', 'wedding', '1+2', 'quot', 'quot', 'Joy', 'Life', 'quot', 'quot', 'Toss', 'feathers', 'quot', '-These', 'songs', 'are', 'only', 'instrumental', 'played', 'whole', 'band', 'celtic', 'music', 'purest', 'fountain', 'played', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'listening', 'Amazing', 'quot', 'Only', 'when', 'sleep', 'quot', 'great', 'moment', 'show', 'Andrea', 'who', 'was', 'chosen', 'one', '50', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'perfoms', 'acting', 'naive', 'girl', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'sexy', 'love', 'way', 'audience', 'seduce', 'charm.', 'quot', 'So', 'young', 'quot', 'very', 'joyfull', 'song', 'how', 'good', 'be', 'young', 'have', 'whole', 'future', 'front', 'Violins', 'keyboard', 'make', 'unforgettable.', 'quot', 'right', 'time', 'quot', 'song', 'first', 'CD', 'pop', 'celtic', 'tradition', 'song', 'listen', 'wonderful', 'violin', 'solos.', 'quot', 'never', 'loved', 'anyway', 'quot', 'great', 'track', 'girl', 'breaking', 'up', 'boyfriend', 'out', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'never', 'really', 'loved', 'him.The', 'other', 'songs', 'featured', 'show', 'are', 'as', 'good', 'ones', 'mentioned', 'before', 'certainly', 'DVD', 'be', 'purchased', 'who', 'appreciate', 'quality']",N/A
