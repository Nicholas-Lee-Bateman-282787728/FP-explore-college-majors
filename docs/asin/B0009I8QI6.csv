I am a Huge fan of the book and the movie.  This show draws more on the book and leaves the satire of the movie behind.  Not to say that it does not have a good sense of humor to it, when you are dealing with a war with Giant bugs you need to have some humor ;), it is just not the same type of dark humor / satire.  Guess it depends on your preference - do you want a more gung ho war action movie like the book or do you want a political satire with action etc?Anyway - one of the major issued I had was the music choices. A constant techno style beat is playing in the backround of each episode. So much so that I wish the audio options had an ability to turn off the music for each episode.  You can tell the animators were being rushed at times- they do good work but the animation quality seems to change from episode to episode.On the positive side- The movie changes some of the things from both book and film but keeps the action fun and exciting. The characters are well established and you have a good dynamic between all the man players- even a ""love"" triangle introduced in the movie and continued in the show that strangely still works.Not a bad set of disk I was just looking for a bit more with so many super positive reviews I guess my standards were a bit too high.",3,I am going to be in the minority on this review,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",2007,1414,"['fun', 'TV', 'show', 'Heinlein', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'yes', 'Sadly', 'did', 'find', 'had', 'flaws', 'am', 'Huge', 'fan', 'book', 'movie', 'show', 'more', 'book', 'satire', 'movie', 'behind', 'Not', 'say', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'are', 'dealing', 'war', 'Giant', 'bugs', 'need', 'have', 'humor', 'just', 'not', 'same', 'type', 'dark', 'humor', '/', 'satire', 'Guess', 'preference', 'do', 'want', 'more', 'gung', 'ho', 'war', 'action', 'movie', 'book', 'do', 'want', 'political', 'satire', 'action', 'etc', 'Anyway', 'one', 'major', 'issued', 'had', 'was', 'music', 'choices', 'constant', 'techno', 'style', 'beat', 'playing', 'backround', 'episode', 'So', 'much', 'wish', 'audio', 'options', 'had', 'ability', 'turn', 'off', 'music', 'episode', 'can', 'tell', 'animators', 'were', 'being', 'rushed', 'times-', 'do', 'good', 'work', 'animation', 'quality', 'change', 'episode', 'episode.On', 'positive', 'side-', 'movie', 'things', 'book', 'film', 'action', 'fun', 'exciting', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'established', 'have', 'good', 'dynamic', 'man', 'players-', 'even', 'love', 'triangle', 'introduced', 'movie', 'continued', 'show', 'strangely', 'still', 'works.Not', 'bad', 'set', 'disk', 'was', 'just', 'looking', 'bit', 'more', 'so', 'many', 'super', 'positive', 'reviews', 'guess', 'standards', 'were', 'bit', 'too', 'high']",N/A

906083,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B0009I8QI6,Brent Butler,"[2, 2]","I didn't know what to expect from this series. The rave reviews I think exaggerate its quality. I'm an original fan of Heinlein's Starship Troopers books, and this series is probably closer to the books than the three movies were.On the good side, the episodes provide you with a variety of experience in battle locations and varying types of ""bugs"". Each story has a rather simple objective, achieved only after considerable combat. Luckily for the troopers in the series, bugs seem to be much easier to kill here than they were in the first movie in particular. LOLOn the bad side, the plots are entirely predictable. In almost every episode, some of our favorite characters are surrounded by bugs in a hopeless situation, only to have help appear at the very last moment and shoot their way out of it.Surprisingly, the animation is best when showing bugs, possibly because their movement can be unnatural enough to us that we can accept whatever it looks like as normal. The troopers' movement, however, often is very unnatural, and considerable shortcuts are taken in their motion in many of the action scenes. Their bodies are unnaturally rigid, and of course facial expressions are almost non-existent.While many of the stories are interesting in terms of the objective and final result of the missions, the dialogue does not greatly contribute to enjoyment of the episodes. The writers seemed to take their favorite three or four ""macho lines"" from the first movie, and they use those over and over in EVERY episode. The Lieutenant in particular is limited almost exclusively to ""tough"" admonitions and orders, with no depth whatsoever to his character. This is particularly disappointing to fans of the novel, as we all know that in the book he was a brilliant and eloquent Civics teacher, and the voice for some of Heinlein's more interesting social essays.So yes, this is worth a watch. You have to forgive it a few flaws, but in terms of animated sci-fi warfare, our choices are pretty limited to this and Clone Wars, so there aren't many alternatives if you prefer this type of story.There is at least one streaming video service which provides these shows for free (very limited commercials). I certainly would not recommend paying top dollar for it as a purchase.",3,"Surprised me, but the animation is very uneven",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,2277,"['did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'series', 'rave', 'reviews', 'think', 'exaggerate', 'quality', ""'m"", 'original', 'fan', 'Heinlein', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'books', 'series', 'probably', 'closer', 'books', 'three', 'movies', 'good', 'side', 'episodes', 'provide', 'variety', 'experience', 'battle', 'locations', 'varying', 'types', 'bugs', 'story', 'rather', 'simple', 'objective', 'achieved', 'only', 'considerable', 'combat', 'Luckily', 'troopers', 'series', 'bugs', 'seem', 'be', 'much', 'easier', 'kill', 'here', 'were', 'first', 'movie', 'particular', 'LOLOn', 'bad', 'side', 'plots', 'are', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'almost', 'episode', 'favorite', 'characters', 'are', 'surrounded', 'bugs', 'hopeless', 'situation', 'only', 'have', 'help', 'appear', 'very', 'last', 'moment', 'shoot', 'way', 'it.Surprisingly', 'animation', 'best', 'when', 'showing', 'bugs', 'possibly', 'movement', 'can', 'be', 'unnatural', 'enough', 'can', 'accept', 'normal', 'troopers', 'movement', 'however', 'often', 'very', 'unnatural', 'considerable', 'shortcuts', 'are', 'taken', 'motion', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'bodies', 'are', 'unnaturally', 'rigid', 'course', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'almost', 'non-existent.While', 'many', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'terms', 'objective', 'final', 'result', 'missions', 'dialogue', 'not', 'greatly', 'contribute', 'enjoyment', 'episodes', 'writers', 'seemed', 'take', 'favorite', 'three', 'four', 'macho', 'lines', 'first', 'movie', 'use', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'Lieutenant', 'particular', 'limited', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'tough', 'admonitions', 'orders', 'depth', 'whatsoever', 'character', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'fans', 'novel', 'know', 'book', 'was', 'brilliant', 'eloquent', 'Civics', 'teacher', 'voice', 'Heinlein', 'more', 'interesting', 'social', 'essays.So', 'yes', 'watch', 'have', 'forgive', 'few', 'flaws', 'terms', 'animated', 'sci-fi', 'warfare', 'choices', 'are', 'pretty', 'limited', 'Clone', 'Wars', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'alternatives', 'prefer', 'type', 'story.There', 'least', 'one', 'streaming', 'video', 'service', 'shows', 'free', 'very', 'limited', 'commercials', 'certainly', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'paying', 'top', 'dollar', 'purchase']",N/A
906084,A3UIFV9CN3BM6U,B0009I8QI6,"B. Williams ""Sci-fi Junkie""","[1, 1]","Roughnecks is a 4-disc collection that was run from 1999 to 2000. It's loosely-based on Robert Heinlein's book ""Starship Troopers"" and was produced by Paul Verhoeven (the same guy who did the movie ""Starship Troopers"" and ""Starship Troopers 3: Marauder""). The series is set around campaigns, with 2 campaigns per disc and is 1990's-quality CGI (that is, it was great for the times, but looks somewhat campy now). The story follows the exploits of John Rico and Razak's Roughnecks, a unit of SICON's Mobile Infantry. The Roughnecks tends to follow Heinlein's book more closely than the movie and the stories are VERY engaging with excellent character development. The action scenes seem to be clearly developed for the Saturday morning audiance, with the only thing you ever see getting killed in combat are the bugs. There are some scenes that are recycled, but you get to see the various Arachnid bio-forms and their ""allies"" the Skinnies. IMHO, it appears that Verheoven wanted this to be his vision of the book instead of the movie.You won't find Johnny Rico's exploits through boot camp until later in the series; with the introduction dropping you straight into the action with the Pluto Campaign. Here. the MI has been brought in to clear out the Arachnids after a previously-failed attempt (called 'Operation: Pest Control', or OPC for short) causes SICON (the Strategically Integrated Coalition of Nations) to re-evaluate their tactics. All the characters from the 1997 movie are here, albeit in different form (for example, Carl Jenkins serces as a psychic attatched to the Roughnecks to help locate bugs). In a later episode, Career Sergeant Zimm returns, who was played in the movie by Clancy Brown; and who voices the Roughnecks' version of his character from the movie.All in all, this is an exciting collection to have. While the series tends to drag on in some segments, there is enough to keep most viewers and lovers of sci-fi entertained. Unfortunately, like the book itself, the series ends on a cliffhangar and there is no new information if this will be rectified or not. Don't let that discourage you from viewing this awesome and exciting series, that while campy and cheezy at times (it was made for kids, after all) has excellent content, stories, and memorable characters.",4,Roughnecks - Great for Sci-fi and Starship Troopers fans,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,2298,"['Roughnecks', '4-disc', 'collection', 'was', 'run', '1999', '2000', 'loosely-based', 'Robert', 'Heinlein', 'book', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'was', 'produced', 'Paul', 'Verhoeven', 'same', 'guy', 'who', 'did', 'movie', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'Starship', 'Troopers', '3', 'Marauder', 'series', 'set', 'campaigns', '2', 'campaigns', 'disc', ""1990's-quality"", 'CGI', 'was', 'great', 'times', 'somewhat', 'campy', 'now', 'story', 'exploits', 'John', 'Rico', 'Razak', 'Roughnecks', 'unit', 'SICON', 'Mobile', 'Infantry', 'Roughnecks', 'follow', 'Heinlein', 'book', 'more', 'closely', 'movie', 'stories', 'are', 'VERY', 'engaging', 'excellent', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'seem', 'be', 'clearly', 'developed', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'audiance', 'only', 'thing', 'ever', 'see', 'getting', 'killed', 'combat', 'are', 'bugs', 'are', 'scenes', 'are', 'recycled', 'get', 'see', 'various', 'Arachnid', 'bio-forms', 'allies', 'Skinnies', 'IMHO', 'Verheoven', 'wanted', 'be', 'vision', 'book', 'instead', 'movie.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Johnny', 'Rico', 'exploits', 'boot', 'camp', 'later', 'series', 'introduction', 'dropping', 'straight', 'action', 'Pluto', 'Campaign', 'Here', 'MI', 'been', 'brought', 'clear', 'out', 'Arachnids', 'previously-failed', 'attempt', 'called', ""'Operation"", 'Pest', 'Control', 'OPC', 'short', 'SICON', 'Strategically', 'Integrated', 'Coalition', 'Nations', 're-evaluate', 'tactics', 'characters', '1997', 'movie', 'are', 'here', 'albeit', 'different', 'form', 'example', 'Carl', 'Jenkins', 'serces', 'psychic', 'attatched', 'Roughnecks', 'help', 'locate', 'bugs', 'later', 'episode', 'Career', 'Sergeant', 'Zimm', 'returns', 'who', 'was', 'played', 'movie', 'Clancy', 'Brown', 'who', 'Roughnecks', 'version', 'character', 'movie.All', 'exciting', 'collection', 'have', 'series', 'drag', 'segments', 'enough', 'keep', 'most', 'viewers', 'lovers', 'sci-fi', 'entertained', 'Unfortunately', 'book', 'series', 'cliffhangar', 'new', 'information', 'will', 'be', 'rectified', 'not', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'discourage', 'viewing', 'awesome', 'exciting', 'series', 'campy', 'cheezy', 'times', 'was', 'made', 'kids', 'excellent', 'content', 'stories', 'memorable', 'characters']",N/A

What we have here is an adaption of the book done completely in CGI.  At the time the effects were pretty good for a simple show on TV.  Despite having a dated look by today's standards, the show has a great story which will please Sci-fi fans and fans of Starship Troopers alike.  Every episode is packed with adventure and paced well.  Once you start watching you probably won't be able to stop!This boxset gives you all the campaigns in 4 DVD-Slim cases.DVD 1 - Pluto and Hydra Campaign  (Special Features - Photo Galleries)DVD 2 - Tophet and Tesca Campaign  (Special Features - Photo Galleries)DVD 3 - Zephyr and Klendathu Campaign  (Special Features - Photo Galleries)DVD 4 - Tracks and Homefront Campaign  (Special Features - 4 Bonus episodes; Pluto And Beyond/Propaganda Machine/Marooned/Court-Martial of Lt. Razak)There are PROS and CONS to owning this set, with some of the CONS holding it back from being a 5 star boxset.PROS- All 8 Campaigns in one affordable package (Easily will save you $50+ vs buying them separately)- Contains 4 bonus episodes** (Details below)- Collectable fold-out Illustration/poster- Campaign is organized by chronological order to make it easier to view / follow the storyline- 5.1 Dobly Digital audioCONS- Standard 4:3 cut instead of a 16:9 transfer(The show was originally processed in, 4:3 so in a way it retains its original look)- No Subtitles or additional language support- Not Entirely a ""COMPLETE set"".  This set leaves off episode 33 and the final 3 episodes of the show.  The reason for this is that the show got cancelled after 36 episodes, with episodes 33, 38-40 never being produced. ** The BONUS episodes are re-uses of old footage to allow the creators to fulfill the contract of 40 episodes and do not continue the storyline- SPECIAL FEATURES are reduced vs the individual releases- Lack of any sort of behind the scenes/making of featurettesThe CONS to this set are not really bad so to say, but do prevent it from being called a ""complete"" collection.  What we have here is an efficient re-boxing of the DVD's with some features missing.  In doing so, you get a package that is chronologically organized for you by campaign, and take up far less space in your collection.Despite the flaws in the ""complete campaigns"" edition this is a must by for a fan of the movie, the show when it was on TV, or even the book.  It is a boxset that is great for a simple collection providing you with the entire show in one easy packaging.

The series adds considerably to the variety of the Bugs, shows the Skinnies for the first time, and treats the cameraderie, training, and discipline of the soldiers with the utmost seriousness, not with the vicious mockery of the movie. They are followed through several campaign story arcs that take them to widely varying planetary environments, even eventually back to Earth to fight off an invasion of their homeworld. The characters and their relationships show great interplay and tremendous growth as the stories unfold. Unlike the movie, the power armor introduced in the book is everywhere, and the major characters of the book are there, along with quite a number of excellent new folks.STC was an excellent show for its time, but it was never given proper treatment by U.S. television. The characters, designs, artwork, and stories were excellent. This was one of the earlier shows done with motion capture technology, so much of the animation is not up to current standards, but so what? It's still a good series, far better than the abomination of a movie that inspired it, and much closer to the spirit of Heinlein's superb original book.It's very unlikely that new episodes have been produced for it. The producers said several years ago that there was effectively zero chance that the missing four episodes would be produced, so it's probably just a repackaging of the earlier material, maybe with some decent extras.

The disc breakdown looks something like this:Disc 1: The Pluto Campaign / The Hydora CampaignDisc 2: The Tophet Campaign / The Tesca CampaignDisc 3: The Zephyr Campaign / The Klendathu CampaignDisc 4: Trackers / The Homefront Campaign / 4 Bonus Episodes (the clip shows)There is no new material here, still no conclusion to the series. In fact, there is LESS material than you will find on the individually packaged campaigns. The ""Extras"" have been paired down considerably and there are no foreign language tracks or subtitles of any kind. The only extras included in the boxed set are the same Photo Galleries you will find on the original releases and an exclusive illustration insert. The artwork on the insert is fine and I liked the fact that it listed the titles of the individual episodes on the inside, but the chapter breaks on the DVDs are still identical to the original releases and don't necessarily match the original episode transitions (although some do).So in summary, here are the Pros and Cons of owning the Roughnecks: STC Boxed Set:PROS:-------------------------- You will save nearly $100 (or more) compared to the price you'd pay if you buy each campaign disc individually.- The campaign order is clearly labeled and already sorted out for you.- There is a pretty fold-out picture included.- It takes up less space on a shelf.CONS:-------------------------- No foreign language tracks- No subtitles- No filmmakers' commentaries- No technical commentaries- No filmographies- No easter eggsSo if you want to save money and shelf space, by all means, get the boxed set!

If you include the four clip shows there were 40 episodes released already. Interesting thing is there are four missing episodes that were never produced. The big question is whether or not the four never made episodes have been made and are included and they took out the clip shows, or is it the other way around? They have had the voice scripts recorded and lots of motion capture material so theoretically it can be done... if Sony was willing to pony up the funds.Unfortunately I doubt those four episodes were made. I have heard absolutely nothing about them being done and you would think that would be a major selling point of this DVD set. Since 40 episodes have been made (with the clip shows) and I doubt they would take away the clip shows on a ""complete"" set anyway. My thought is we won't have what all of us Roughnecks fans really want... a complete series.I'm also wondering what extras we would be getting here. This is just a four disk set and it's going to hold 40 episodes. You figure 22 minutes is the standard running time and that's over three hours per disk of just the film. How much more can be put in? It sounds like some of the extras you get from the single disks now might be taken out. Namely the commentaries. Again this is just speculation since hardly any information has been released so far.I can't tell the future so I could be totally wrong on this.
