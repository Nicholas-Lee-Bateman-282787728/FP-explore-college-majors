Great to have if you collect the series.,5,MASH is Great,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,133,"['love', 'MASH', 'HAVE', 'have', 'box', 'set', 'last', 'season', 'final', 'movie', 'Great', 'have', 'collect', 'series']",M*A*S*H: Season 7
1016065,AE23DYT0RDFUV,B000HT3P5G,Brian Ridgway,"[0, 0]","It's been probably 20 years since I've viewed these original episodes of the classic MASH series. Although MASH has always been one of my favorite series, it seemed that at the time, the show was getting a bit 'long-in-the-tooth' and had run out of steam. I do not necessarily agree with some critics who always parrot the complaint that '(Alda) or the show became too preachy.' So it had a humanistic viewpoint - more emotional than political? Can you blame it? I think one of the truly unique qualities about the series is that over time, it changed. It never pandered to audience whims, but respected viewers enough to make political and character/content changes that were usually subtle and often quite compelling.Upon a recent re-viewing however, I found this final season remarkably SOLID, funny and touching without too much sentiment. In fact, as much as I enjoy the earlier episodes (seasons 3-6 are my favorites and contain the bulk of my favorite episodes) , I was surprised to realize that THREE of my all-time favorite episodes were in this season: Bombshells (B.J. reluctantly gets a Bronze Star); Give and Take (a general's son dies at the 4077) and Foreign Affairs (Charles falls in and quickly out of love). At this point of the series, the writers were getting away from some of the sentiment and politics of the mid-series seasons, and were focused more on solid and accurate war stories that were more reflective of the times. This season was also more focused on B.J and Potter as well, with some standout performances with a much more commanding Farrell and seasoned Morgan doing the heavy lifting. There are also nice directorial turns by Jamie Farr, Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan too. In fact, Alda keeps a pretty low profile throughout this season, allowing his co-stars to really shine. And series regulars like Clyde Kusatu and Soon Tek Oh return for some the best episodes of this final season as well. Although this 16-episode season was shorter than the standard 22-24 episode arc, the quality and care throughout each detail is evident. Maybe in hindsight, CBS and FOX would've been smarter to splice up the final feature into weekly installments to give viewers a bit of a break - it was almost too much material to take in! The feature-length finale - PACKED with almost too many story lines -- delivers an episode a bit top heavy in content/changes and historical progression. But it's a minor complaint for a season that is full of good quality performances, funny character moments and memorable programming.",5,MASH Final Season SOLID Entries with Best in Series,1286582400,"10 9, 2010",2010,2545,"['been', 'probably', '20', 'years', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'original', 'episodes', 'classic', 'MASH', 'series', 'MASH', 'always', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'series', 'seemed', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'getting', 'bit', ""'long-in-the-tooth"", 'had', 'run', 'steam', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'agree', 'critics', 'who', 'always', 'parrot', 'complaint', 'Alda', 'show', 'became', 'too', 'preachy', 'had', 'humanistic', 'viewpoint', 'more', 'emotional', 'political', 'Can', 'blame', 'think', 'one', 'truly', 'unique', 'qualities', 'series', 'time', 'changed', 'never', 'pandered', 'audience', 'whims', 'respected', 'viewers', 'enough', 'make', 'political', 'character/content', 'changes', 'were', 'usually', 'subtle', 'often', 'quite', 'recent', 're-viewing', 'however', 'found', 'final', 'season', 'remarkably', 'SOLID', 'funny', 'touching', 'too', 'much', 'sentiment', 'fact', 'as', 'much', 'enjoy', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'seasons', '3-6', 'are', 'favorites', 'contain', 'bulk', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'was', 'surprised', 'realize', 'THREE', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'were', 'season', 'Bombshells', 'B.J', 'reluctantly', 'Bronze', 'Star', 'Give', 'Take', 'general', 'son', '4077', 'Foreign', 'Affairs', 'Charles', 'quickly', 'love', 'point', 'series', 'writers', 'were', 'getting', 'away', 'sentiment', 'politics', 'mid-series', 'seasons', 'were', 'focused', 'more', 'solid', 'accurate', 'war', 'stories', 'were', 'more', 'reflective', 'times', 'season', 'was', 'also', 'more', 'focused', 'B.J', 'Potter', 'as', 'well', 'standout', 'performances', 'much', 'more', 'commanding', 'Farrell', 'seasoned', 'Morgan', 'doing', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'are', 'also', 'nice', 'directorial', 'turns', 'Jamie', 'Farr', 'Mike', 'Farrell', 'Harry', 'Morgan', 'too', 'fact', 'Alda', 'pretty', 'low', 'profile', 'season', 'allowing', 'co-stars', 'really', 'shine', 'series', 'regulars', 'Clyde', 'Kusatu', 'Soon', 'Tek', 'Oh', 'return', 'best', 'episodes', 'final', 'season', 'well', '16-episode', 'season', 'was', 'shorter', 'standard', '22-24', 'episode', 'arc', 'quality', 'care', 'detail', 'evident', 'Maybe', 'hindsight', 'CBS', 'FOX', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'smarter', 'splice', 'up', 'final', 'feature', 'weekly', 'installments', 'give', 'viewers', 'bit', 'break', 'was', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'material', 'take', 'feature-length', 'finale', 'PACKED', 'almost', 'too', 'many', 'story', 'lines', 'episode', 'bit', 'top', 'heavy', 'content/changes', 'historical', 'progression', 'minor', 'complaint', 'season', 'full', 'good', 'quality', 'performances', 'funny', 'character', 'moments', 'memorable', 'programming']",M*A*S*H: Season 7

After they left, I felt the show lost a little bit of its luster, but I have to admit, that the final season was one of the best.  The producers, directors and actors really pulled it all together for a fitting send-off.  I'm also glad that I didn't buy the recently released complete series set.

I was a huge fan of M.A.S.H. for many years, often going to the Fox Ranch and walking among the outdoor set. It was really fun to wander around that camp, exploring the tents, the big tin hospital building and the helicopter pad. In the middle of filming season 11, a huge wildfire swept through the hills and obliterated everything in it's path - including the 4077th. The tents were destroyed and the tin hospital building was for the most part melted. The writing staff wrote it into the script for the final episode, doing a fine job at that. Really, they had no choice. The hills were completely blackened. The final episode was very well done.

Charles meets an officer he assumes to be privledged, who's a chauffer. Margaret is infactuated with a Swedish  man who has a rather delicate issue.

Hawkeye, though, is stuck in the middle.STRANGE BEDFELLOWS - Potter must deal with some disturbing news about his son-in-law who's visiting for a spell. Charles, meanwhile, is snoring.  He denies it, keeping B.J, hawkeye awake. Eventually then entire camp yells at him, while still in denial.SAY NO MORE - Margaret gets invited to a lecture and meeting with a doctor she admires.

He begins to question his own motives when the man was after his boots to keep his feet warm.AS TIME GOES BY - After reading about a time capsule being in Stars and Stripes, Margaret and Hawkeye concoct a plan to build their own. This capule includes Radar's Teddy bear, a pair of boots, a dress from Klinger, a fishing lure, and a bottle of booze, which Margaret refuses to put in until Charles reminds her that it will be over 150 years old when the capsule is opened.

Charles deals with the long delayed building of a latrine. He ""captures"" some North Koreans whom he fears will kill him when they reach into a motorcycle.

He says that after the experiences there ""Being where the action is isn't all it's cracked up to be, for that neither is cracking up!"" He figures that he wants to be able to talk to patients so he'll be a simple doctor in his home town. B.J says that he met this little cookie in the airport who begged him to run away with her ""I figure what the heck"" then says he's only kidding.Everyone talks about getting home. Everyone, except that is, for Klinger, who's staying in Korea. Because his fiancee needs to find her family first.Their final day together includes Klinger's marriage and lot's of tearful goodbyes, including a nice exchange between Charles and Margaret who've never really seen eye-to-eye.All in all a great episode and I couldn't think of a better way to end the show. Klinger staying in Korea after all his attempts to get a section-8. Mulcahy, a priest, dealing with deafness. Charles facing serious issues with music after the prisoners he was working with and befriends are all killed aside from one.

The ""Box Set"" has two (2) extra discs full of extras.  I've spent well over $286 dollars buying these sets.  At the end they release a ""Box Set"" with many extras for a hundred dollars cheaper!!!  I feel like I was taken for a ride.I hope other devoted fans who took the time to colloect the sets over the past six years raise up and voice their disappointmnet over this treatment.  We should be sent the extra discs for free!!!  Heck, we can even buy them separate if we wanted to.  I've learned my lesson to never buy another set again until the final release.

I love the fact that they took what started as pure comedy and realized it could be so much more. They had room to make social commentary about war and race among other things and they could still do comedy in between. It didn't have to be heavy handed or preachy.
