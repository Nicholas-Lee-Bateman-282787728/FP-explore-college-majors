1653738,A25QJBK33C4O0R,B00D4CH1QM,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[13, 16]","After seeing someone else's ""Like"" of this film go by in my social media news feed, I was intrigued enough to investigate just what this crowd sourced project was all about.As a fan of history this film seemed a natural for me to gravitate to and as I read more about it, I became more and more determined to help this film be successful.  Months later, after the filmmaker was able to raise nearly double his original goal, and expand the official release of this film into more cities, I finally received the reward that was promised to me for my donation: a copy of the film on Blu-ray disc.I put the disc into my Blu-ray player just to check it out and see what I thought of the film thinking that I'd wind up watching the film later, but once I put in the disc, wife 2.0 and I both found ourselves drawn into the film wanting to see it through to the conclusion.I've followed the filmmaker on Facebook since first finding out about the film and through that connection I had seen the filmmakers reaction to one relatively negative review that he had received.  (Actually, I'd say it as a pretty harsh review of the film.)  It seemed, from my own reading of the review, that the reviewer had pretty much missed the point of the film instead finding himself too concerned about the filmmaker's technique and artistic styling that went into this film.Readers should notice that I didn't give this film all 5 of the stars that I could have in the rating, rather stopping at 4.  I (and my wife) enjoyed the film and liked the way that it was put together, but I can't say the filmmaker achieved perfection in his intended goal.  I think he did a good job, and I admire the technique he used (using historical photos to create backgrounds that would be used with green screen techniques) but I must admit that there were more than a couple of places where the technique didn't work as well for me and made the film seem, well, a bit cheaply made when I suspect it was anything but.[ actually I could side detour here a bit and rant on a bit about a filmmaker that I'm also a fan of, Roger Corman, see for example:Corman's World, as he was definitely the king of budget filmmaking, but that is a completely different topic really ]The story that makes up this film is a good and interesting one and left me (and I think my wife) feeling like we had learned more about Abraham Lincoln's time in the office of the Presidency, along with more about his friend and protector, Ward Hill Lamon.  While we all know how Lincoln's life ended, not many know that much about Lamon and the work he had done.Wife 2.0 felt that the star who portrayed Abraham Lincoln didn't seem to quite fit the role.  He came through nicely, sounded like most people might have expected Lincoln to sound, but didn't quite fit the physical frame that most people would expect of Abraham Lincoln.  Where there's an expectation that Abraham Lincoln was tall and towered over most others around him, the scenes in this film that show him with others would likely leave viewers feeling that Lincoln was of somewhat average height.  I know thats a small nit to pick, and that in the end this was likely a strategic decision to have a better quality actor in the role compared to someone that just happened to be the right size, but it was at least a little distracting while watching the film.In the end, again, I'm proud to have been a backer (even if only in a small way) of this film, am glad that it was released and is making it out on Blu-ray and DVD and highly encourage others to watch it.  It would be an excellent film to show in schools and would hopefully hold the interest of young viewers.",4,Proud to have been a supporter of this film,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,3666,"['seeing', 'someone', 'else', 'film', 'go', 'social', 'media', 'news', 'feed', 'was', 'intrigued', 'enough', 'investigate', 'just', 'what', 'crowd', 'sourced', 'project', 'was', 'about.As', 'fan', 'history', 'film', 'seemed', 'natural', 'gravitate', 'read', 'more', 'became', 'more', 'more', 'determined', 'help', 'film', 'be', 'successful', 'Months', 'later', 'filmmaker', 'was', 'able', 'raise', 'nearly', 'double', 'original', 'goal', 'expand', 'official', 'release', 'film', 'more', 'cities', 'finally', 'received', 'reward', 'was', 'promised', 'donation', 'copy', 'film', 'Blu-ray', 'disc.I', 'put', 'disc', 'Blu-ray', 'player', 'just', 'check', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'thought', 'film', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'wind', 'up', 'watching', 'film', 'later', 'once', 'put', 'disc', 'wife', '2.0', 'found', 'drawn', 'film', 'wanting', 'see', 'conclusion.I', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'filmmaker', 'Facebook', 'first', 'finding', 'out', 'film', 'connection', 'had', 'seen', 'filmmakers', 'reaction', 'one', 'relatively', 'negative', 'review', 'had', 'received', 'Actually', ""'d"", 'say', 'pretty', 'harsh', 'review', 'film', 'seemed', 'own', 'reading', 'review', 'reviewer', 'had', 'pretty', 'much', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'instead', 'finding', 'too', 'concerned', 'filmmaker', 'technique', 'artistic', 'styling', 'went', 'film.Readers', 'should', 'notice', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'could', 'have', 'rating', 'rather', 'stopping', '4', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'liked', 'way', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'filmmaker', 'achieved', 'perfection', 'intended', 'goal', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'admire', 'technique', 'used', 'using', 'historical', 'photos', 'create', 'backgrounds', 'would', 'be', 'used', 'green', 'screen', 'techniques', 'must', 'admit', 'were', 'more', 'couple', 'places', 'where', 'technique', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'as', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'seem', 'well', 'bit', 'cheaply', 'made', 'when', 'suspect', 'was', 'anything', '[', 'actually', 'could', 'side', 'detour', 'here', 'bit', 'rant', 'bit', 'filmmaker', ""'m"", 'also', 'fan', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'see', 'example', 'Corman', 'World', 'was', 'definitely', 'king', 'budget', 'filmmaking', 'completely', 'different', 'topic', 'really', 'story', 'up', 'film', 'good', 'interesting', 'one', 'left', 'think', 'wife', 'feeling', 'had', 'learned', 'more', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'time', 'office', 'Presidency', 'more', 'friend', 'protector', 'Ward', 'Hill', 'Lamon', 'know', 'how', 'Lincoln', 'life', 'ended', 'not', 'many', 'know', 'much', 'Lamon', 'work', 'had', 'done.Wife', '2.0', 'felt', 'star', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'quite', 'fit', 'role', 'came', 'nicely', 'sounded', 'most', 'people', 'might', 'have', 'expected', 'Lincoln', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'physical', 'frame', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'expect', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Where', 'expectation', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'tall', 'towered', 'most', 'others', 'scenes', 'film', 'show', 'others', 'would', 'likely', 'leave', 'viewers', 'feeling', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'somewhat', 'average', 'height', 'know', 'small', 'nit', 'pick', 'end', 'was', 'likely', 'strategic', 'decision', 'have', 'better', 'quality', 'actor', 'role', 'compared', 'someone', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'right', 'size', 'was', 'least', 'little', 'distracting', 'watching', 'film.In', 'end', 'again', ""'m"", 'proud', 'have', 'been', 'backer', 'even', 'only', 'small', 'way', 'film', 'am', 'glad', 'was', 'released', 'making', 'out', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'highly', 'encourage', 'others', 'watch', 'would', 'be', 'excellent', 'film', 'show', 'schools', 'would', 'hopefully', 'hold', 'interest', 'young', 'viewers']",Saving Lincoln

1653740,A2V8ZBML1TU3H5,B00D4CH1QM,William E. Byrnes,"[27, 27]","While the 2012 film Lincoln was very good, and it was a pleasure sitting in a theater and hearing people laugh at Lincoln's jokes, even if they were one hundred and fifty years old, this film seems to capture something more like the connection Lincoln had to his adopted home in Illinois. I had read Lamon's book Remembrances of Abraham Lincoln, through the Illinois Digital Archive, and it was a fascinating account.  As does the film, it begins in the 8th judicial circuit in the 1840s, and follows Lincoln through his career in Congress, the two races for the US Senate in 1856 and 1858, the Presidency and right up to that last encounter. The plaintive statement ""and that was the last time I saw my friend"", is as heartrending in the film as it was in print.For me, historical figures are more interesting for their humanity, than the monumental achievements of their careers. Ever since I was a child, I felt more of a connection to Lincoln from a line like ""I cannot spare this man, he fights!""  than from ""four score and seven years ago"". This film, like Lamon's book, sees the Lincolns as a family, faced with a terrible tragedy, reflecting the tragedy that befell all families in the years from 1861-1865. They face the end of the nation, with the collapse of the Union, but with the help of Hill's ""West Virginia Claw Hammer"" they enjoy a spirited rendition of the trials of ""old Dan Tucker"". In the verse that Mary sings alone, she seems almost a young girl in love again. That's a rare view of the First Lady, that so many film makers have preferred to see as either a spendthrift or a madwoman. I've always thought it was unfair to view her so harshly, since by the time Robert had her committed to the sanitarium in my home town, Batavia, the lady had buried all but one of her children, her parents and her husband.Lincoln has been treated more as a human than Mary, by historians, the commutation of death sentences, that beautiful letter to Mrs. Bixby, the mother who ""laid such a costly sacrifice upon the altar of freedom"", and the admonition to the former slave who knelt at his feet when he and Tad visited Richmond. That human touch rings true here, throughout the film. Lincoln isn't always the humorist, laughing to keep from weeping, but he also shows his temper to General McClellan. Its an altogether human picture of our 16th President and his family.All in all, I can highly recommend this presentation of Lincoln, as a needed addition to a view of our 16th President. He wasn't made of marble after all.",5,Excellent film about Lincoln and his Illinois friends,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",2013,2534,"['2012', 'film', 'Lincoln', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'pleasure', 'sitting', 'theater', 'hearing', 'people', 'laugh', 'Lincoln', 'jokes', 'even', 'were', 'one', 'hundred', 'fifty', 'years', 'old', 'film', 'capture', 'something', 'more', 'connection', 'Lincoln', 'had', 'adopted', 'home', 'Illinois', 'had', 'read', 'Lamon', 'book', 'Remembrances', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Illinois', 'Digital', 'Archive', 'was', 'fascinating', 'account', 'film', '8th', 'judicial', 'circuit', '1840s', 'Lincoln', 'career', 'Congress', 'two', 'races', 'US', 'Senate', '1856', '1858', 'Presidency', 'right', 'up', 'last', 'encounter', 'plaintive', 'statement', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'friend', 'heartrending', 'film', 'was', 'print.For', 'historical', 'figures', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'humanity', 'monumental', 'achievements', 'careers', 'Ever', 'was', 'child', 'felt', 'more', 'connection', 'Lincoln', 'line', 'can', 'not', 'spare', 'man', 'four', 'score', 'seven', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'Lamon', 'book', 'Lincolns', 'family', 'faced', 'terrible', 'tragedy', 'reflecting', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'families', 'years', '1861-1865', 'face', 'end', 'nation', 'collapse', 'Union', 'help', 'Hill', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Claw', 'Hammer', 'enjoy', 'spirited', 'rendition', 'trials', 'old', 'Dan', 'Tucker', 'verse', 'Mary', 'sings', 'alone', 'almost', 'young', 'girl', 'love', 'again', 'rare', 'view', 'First', 'Lady', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'spendthrift', 'madwoman', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'unfair', 'view', 'so', 'harshly', 'time', 'Robert', 'had', 'committed', 'sanitarium', 'home', 'town', 'Batavia', 'lady', 'had', 'buried', 'one', 'children', 'parents', 'husband.Lincoln', 'been', 'treated', 'more', 'human', 'Mary', 'historians', 'commutation', 'death', 'sentences', 'beautiful', 'letter', 'Mrs.', 'Bixby', 'mother', 'who', 'laid', 'such', 'costly', 'sacrifice', 'altar', 'freedom', 'admonition', 'former', 'slave', 'who', 'knelt', 'feet', 'when', 'Tad', 'visited', 'Richmond', 'human', 'touch', 'rings', 'true', 'here', 'film', 'Lincoln', ""n't"", 'always', 'humorist', 'laughing', 'keep', 'weeping', 'also', 'temper', 'General', 'McClellan', 'altogether', 'human', 'picture', '16th', 'President', 'family.All', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'presentation', 'Lincoln', 'needed', 'addition', 'view', '16th', 'President', 'was', ""n't"", 'made', 'marble']",Saving Lincoln
