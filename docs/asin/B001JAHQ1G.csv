Marold""","[0, 0]","One of the best things about this season happens at the end, when outstanding character actor, Stanley Tucci arrives as the new chief of emergency medicine, and Dr. Kerry Weaver's career takes an odd twist.John Stamos joins the cast as an intern (after completing medical school and serving as an EMT last season. There is nothing about Stamos role or acting which appeals to me especially (unlike Noah Whyle, Goren Visjnic, and Mekhi Phifer.I suppose it's necessary to make a good drama, but I find it very hard to take when good characters leave the show. More often than not, or so it seems, many strong characters leave by dying than by any other means. Career failures are almost as wrenching, as when Carter went through his intervention and rehabilitation after his narcotics addiction. This season has its share of character tragedies and missteps.Sally Field returns as Dr. Abby Lockhart's mother, but not in as heart-wrenching an episode as she did in earlier seasons.The end of last season, the cliff hanger, and the beginning of this season may have been two of the best episodes in the entire run of the series. I didn't want to say anything about it in the review of last season, for fear of a spoiler, but I think I better go back and point it out.

1205818,A1OMAFMY0GGAM1,B001JAHQ1G,Nathan B. Blake,"[28, 31]","If I were to rank seasons of ER, this (and season 15, the final season) would make the top five, along with three of the earlier seasons. Season 13 is majorimprovement over season 12, partly because the writers stop forcing us tosit through Africa episodes.While I think this is one of the best seasons, there is one flaw I'd like tomention early in the review, and that has to do with ER taking (bad) cuesfrom what became it's Thursday night hospital drama competition starting withthis season: Grey's Anatomy. During season 13, I got the feeling that the creative forces behind ER were trying to win over Grey's Anatomy fansby increasing the amount of sex scenes and ""cute"" relationship storylines/moments.ER always had it's relationship stories and sex scenes, and that was fine,but for a brief period in the season, they piled it on too thick. The prime example is Neela's sex dream about Gates in episode 6 or 7. Fortunately, they backed away from that tactic quickly (although this type of scene made another appearancelate in season 14).Now that I have that out of the way, I can mention what makes this an outstandingseason of ER. (CONTAINS SPOILERS) First and foremost, Dr. Weaver departs fora (Dr. Sanjay Gupta) type job at a TV station in Florida. She is missed, but herfinal two episodes (as a regular) are well written and, of course, her acting istop notch. Another highlight is Forest Whitaker's emmy nominated role as CurtisAmes, a former patient of Dr. Kovac who sues him for malpractice. Sally Field makes her final appearance, Abby and Kovac are married, Dr. Morris matures (a little),the hospital is closed for renovation and Stanley Tucci makes the first two appearances of a story arc that continues until the end of season 14.In between these storylines, there are many other shorter patient storylines,many of which are excellent and fresh, unlike some of the repetitive storylinestossed around in seasons 11 and 12.On one final note, this is the season when ER became the most emmy nominatedTV series of all time, with a total of 120 nominations (by the time the seriesended in 2009, the show had been nominated for 124 emmys).",5,Top 5 Season in My Book!,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",2010,2152,"['were', 'rank', 'seasons', 'ER', 'season', '15', 'final', 'season', 'would', 'make', 'top', 'five', 'three', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Season', '13', 'majorimprovement', 'season', '12', 'partly', 'writers', 'stop', 'forcing', 'tosit', 'Africa', 'episodes.While', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'seasons', 'one', 'flaw', ""'d"", 'like', 'tomention', 'early', 'review', 'do', 'ER', 'taking', 'bad', 'cuesfrom', 'what', 'became', 'Thursday', 'night', 'hospital', 'drama', 'competition', 'starting', 'withthis', 'season', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'season', '13', 'got', 'feeling', 'creative', 'forces', 'ER', 'were', 'trying', 'win', 'over', 'Grey', 'Anatomy', 'fansby', 'increasing', 'amount', 'sex', 'scenes', 'cute', 'relationship', 'storylines/moments.ER', 'always', 'had', 'relationship', 'stories', 'sex', 'scenes', 'was', 'fine', 'brief', 'period', 'season', 'piled', 'too', 'thick', 'prime', 'example', 'Neela', 'sex', 'dream', 'Gates', 'episode', '6', '7', 'Fortunately', 'backed', 'away', 'tactic', 'quickly', 'type', 'scene', 'made', 'appearancelate', 'season', '14', '.Now', 'have', 'way', 'can', 'mention', 'what', 'outstandingseason', 'ER', 'CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS', 'First', 'foremost', 'Dr.', 'Weaver', 'fora', 'Dr.', 'Sanjay', 'Gupta', 'type', 'job', 'TV', 'station', 'Florida', 'missed', 'herfinal', 'two', 'episodes', 'regular', 'are', 'well', 'written', 'course', 'acting', 'istop', 'notch', 'highlight', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'emmy', 'nominated', 'role', 'CurtisAmes', 'former', 'patient', 'Dr.', 'Kovac', 'who', 'malpractice', 'Sally', 'Field', 'final', 'appearance', 'Abby', 'Kovac', 'are', 'married', 'Dr.', 'Morris', 'matures', 'little', 'hospital', 'closed', 'renovation', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'first', 'two', 'appearances', 'story', 'arc', 'end', 'season', '14.In', 'storylines', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'shorter', 'patient', 'storylines', 'many', 'are', 'excellent', 'fresh', 'repetitive', 'storylinestossed', 'seasons', '11', '12.On', 'one', 'final', 'note', 'season', 'when', 'ER', 'became', 'most', 'emmy', 'nominatedTV', 'series', 'time', 'total', '120', 'nominations', 'time', 'seriesended', '2009', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'nominated', '124', 'emmys']",N/A
