1359918,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B003R0MF5I,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 3]","Chuck Bartowski embarks on a personal mission to track down his missing mother, aided by John Casey and Sarah Walker. However, they soon discover that Chuck's mother may have ties to Volkoff Industries, an international arms-dealing organisation based in Moscow and now their their #1 target. Complications ensue as Chuck and Sarah get engaged, Ellie and Devon have a baby and an old computer resurfaces which may hold the key to an old mystery...Chuck's fourth and penultimate season is a bit of a mixed bag. It's as reliably watchable as ever but a feeling of staleness is never too far away. Chuck's search for his mum feels a little derivative of his earlier search for his father. The producers try to make the two storylines more individual by painting the characters very differently and approaching the plots in different ways (we meet Chuck's mother very early on and see how she reacts to Chuck's attempts to find her), but there is the feeling that we have been here before. Linda Hamilton's casting as Chuck's mother may also be a geek-friendly nod to the audience (and an excuse for a few Terminator gags), but unfortunately Hamilton gives a stiff and somewhat unconvincing performance that doesn't help the problem.Much more successful is Timothy Dalton, channelling pure scenery-chewing villainy in his role as Volkoff, an evil arms-dealer with a surprisingly sentimental side (a sequence where he plays charades is particularly demented). His appearances are highlights of the season.Where the story goes awry is in the show's descent into predictable cliche. Sarah and Chuck have been together for more than five minutes, so clearly they now have to talk about getting married, with all the attendant, predictable storylines that brings along with it. The actors do their best with the material, but it feels like Chuck-the-espionage-comedy-drama is losing ground to Chuck-the-soap-opera, which is a fundamentally less interesting show. This isn't helped by the emphasis moving more away from the Buy More, with less screen time for Jeff and Lester's crazy antics or Big Mike's curiously entertaining Subway obsession. Isaiah Mustafa (aka 'the Old Spice advert guy') appears a recurring employee at the Buy More which sets up an amusing storyline, but again it fails to fulfil its potential and he soon disappears.Still, the show remains enjoyable on an episode-by-episode basis. At 24 episodes, it's the longest season of the entire series and this would risk the storyline becoming overstretched, but the writers break it into two half-seasons to better handle things. The first half revolves around the battle against Volkoff and the search for Chuck's mum, whilst the second sees a return to more stand-alone storylines before a new story arc involving Volkoff's daughter (an under-written Lauren Cohan) kicks off. This arc, in which Chuck inadvertently turns Volkoff's daughter from an ally into an enemy, is potentially fascinating but falls apart due to some clunky writing and contrived events.The fourth season of Chuck (***) has many individually entertaining episodes and moments, and the regular cast remains as watchable as ever, but there is a feeling of tiredness creeping into affairs. However, the show is rejuvenated by a shake-up in the final episode that could make the fifth and final season more interesting. The season is available in the UK (DVD) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray) now.",4,"Decent, but weaker than the first three seasons.",1339891200,"06 17, 2012",2012,3415,"['Chuck', 'Bartowski', 'personal', 'mission', 'track', 'down', 'missing', 'mother', 'aided', 'John', 'Casey', 'Sarah', 'Walker', 'However', 'soon', 'discover', 'Chuck', 'mother', 'may', 'have', 'ties', 'Volkoff', 'Industries', 'international', 'arms-dealing', 'organisation', 'based', 'Moscow', 'now', '1', 'target', 'Complications', 'ensue', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'get', 'engaged', 'Ellie', 'Devon', 'have', 'baby', 'old', 'computer', 'resurfaces', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'old', 'mystery', 'Chuck', 'fourth', 'penultimate', 'season', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'reliably', 'watchable', 'ever', 'feeling', 'staleness', 'never', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'Chuck', 'search', 'mum', 'little', 'derivative', 'earlier', 'search', 'father', 'producers', 'try', 'make', 'two', 'storylines', 'more', 'individual', 'painting', 'characters', 'very', 'differently', 'approaching', 'plots', 'different', 'ways', 'meet', 'Chuck', 'mother', 'very', 'early', 'see', 'how', 'Chuck', 'attempts', 'find', 'feeling', 'have', 'been', 'here', 'before', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'casting', 'Chuck', 'mother', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'geek-friendly', 'nod', 'audience', 'excuse', 'few', 'Terminator', 'gags', 'unfortunately', 'Hamilton', 'stiff', 'somewhat', 'unconvincing', 'performance', ""n't"", 'help', 'problem.Much', 'more', 'successful', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'channelling', 'pure', 'scenery-chewing', 'villainy', 'role', 'Volkoff', 'evil', 'arms-dealer', 'surprisingly', 'sentimental', 'side', 'sequence', 'where', 'charades', 'particularly', 'demented', 'appearances', 'are', 'highlights', 'season.Where', 'story', 'awry', 'show', 'descent', 'predictable', 'cliche', 'Sarah', 'Chuck', 'have', 'been', 'together', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'clearly', 'now', 'have', 'talk', 'getting', 'married', 'attendant', 'predictable', 'storylines', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'material', 'Chuck-the-espionage-comedy-drama', 'losing', 'ground', 'Chuck-the-soap-opera', 'fundamentally', 'less', 'interesting', 'show', ""n't"", 'helped', 'emphasis', 'moving', 'more', 'away', 'Buy', 'More', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'Jeff', 'Lester', 'crazy', 'antics', 'Big', 'Mike', 'curiously', 'entertaining', 'Subway', 'obsession', 'Isaiah', 'Mustafa', 'aka', ""'the"", 'Old', 'Spice', 'advert', 'guy', 'recurring', 'employee', 'Buy', 'More', 'up', 'amusing', 'storyline', 'again', 'fulfil', 'potential', 'soon', 'disappears.Still', 'show', 'enjoyable', 'episode-by-episode', 'basis', '24', 'episodes', 'longest', 'season', 'entire', 'series', 'would', 'risk', 'storyline', 'becoming', 'overstretched', 'writers', 'break', 'two', 'half-seasons', 'better', 'handle', 'things', 'first', 'half', 'battle', 'Volkoff', 'search', 'Chuck', 'mum', 'whilst', 'second', 'return', 'more', 'stand-alone', 'storylines', 'new', 'story', 'arc', 'involving', 'Volkoff', 'daughter', 'under-written', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'off', 'arc', 'Chuck', 'inadvertently', 'Volkoff', 'daughter', 'ally', 'enemy', 'potentially', 'fascinating', 'apart', 'due', 'clunky', 'writing', 'contrived', 'events.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'Chuck', '***', 'many', 'individually', 'entertaining', 'episodes', 'moments', 'regular', 'cast', 'as', 'watchable', 'ever', 'feeling', 'tiredness', 'creeping', 'affairs', 'However', 'show', 'rejuvenated', 'shake-up', 'final', 'episode', 'could', 'make', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', 'more', 'interesting', 'season', 'available', 'UK', 'DVD', 'USA', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'now']",Chuck:S4 (DVD)
1359919,A1ZAIEZHFLI9UN,B003R0MF5I,Benjamin Archambault,"[1, 2]","This season of Chuck follow the same formula as Chuck Seasons 1-3. In the past, the show has focused on Chuck trying to stay alive (season 1), Chuck getting the girl and learning about his father (season 2), more of Chuck and his father and his girl (season 3).Season 4 opens up a lot more characters than just Chuck, Sarah (his girl) and his dad. This time, we get much deeper in Morgan's life. We get a first good glimpse into Casey's past life. And we also continue to look into the dark corners of Chuck's and Sarah's lives.The series hits some rough spots by including some horrible product placement spots. They were obviously aiming for an effect like the funny spots on Arrested Development, but it just ends up looking like begging and fund raising. Chuck pulls out a Tide stick and points the label at the camera and smiles. A scene starts with a car label that makes the show feel like it's the start of a commercial. And, of course, subway sandwiches are everywhere.It was a bit much.The season gets a bit boring somewhere around 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through, but then picks right back up.The show ends with a cliffhanger (as many do), so you'll definitely want to get the final season 5 after watching this one.",5,"Dropping in quality, but still good",1332374400,"03 22, 2012",2012,1225,"['season', 'Chuck', 'follow', 'same', 'formula', 'Chuck', 'Seasons', '1-3', 'past', 'show', 'focused', 'Chuck', 'trying', 'stay', 'alive', 'season', '1', 'Chuck', 'getting', 'girl', 'learning', 'father', 'season', '2', 'more', 'Chuck', 'father', 'girl', 'season', '3', '.Season', '4', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'characters', 'just', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'girl', 'dad', 'time', 'get', 'much', 'deeper', 'Morgan', 'life', 'get', 'first', 'good', 'glimpse', 'Casey', 'past', 'life', 'also', 'continue', 'look', 'dark', 'corners', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'lives.The', 'series', 'rough', 'spots', 'including', 'horrible', 'product', 'placement', 'spots', 'were', 'obviously', 'aiming', 'effect', 'funny', 'spots', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'just', 'up', 'looking', 'begging', 'fund', 'raising', 'Chuck', 'out', 'Tide', 'stick', 'label', 'camera', 'smiles', 'scene', 'car', 'label', 'show', 'feel', 'start', 'commercial', 'course', 'subway', 'sandwiches', 'are', 'everywhere.It', 'was', 'bit', 'much.The', 'season', 'bit', 'boring', 'somewhere', 'around', '1/2', '3/4', 'way', 'then', 'picks', 'right', 'back', 'up.The', 'show', 'cliffhanger', 'many', 'do', 'so', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'get', 'final', 'season', '5', 'watching', 'one']",Chuck:S4 (DVD)

1359922,AAKIGCBTT38JD,B003R0MF5I,Chris1988,"[0, 0]","Another awesome season of Chuck down the hatch. I had my worries about what would be seen in season 4, and i am happy to say that any fan of Chuck will not be disappointed. The same-old comedy that existed in the first 3 seasons remain intact, and the fresh continuing new story of Chuck doesnt seem to run out of ideas before running out of episodes(always the worry of new seasons there).Chuck is back around as our clumsy, lovable hero has gone from unknown computer geek to fresh new spy with the Intersect, and he's got the girl: the beautiful Sarah Walker that waits for him at work everyday. Newcomers who need initiation to the series better remedy that by watching seasons 1-3, cuz this season is not gonna have time to play ""catch up"". Season 4 begins pretty much where season 3 had ended. Chuck wants to find his mother and piece together the mystery of her disappearance from his life at a young age. Morgan, Sarah and John agree to help him do exactly while back at the sunny place of Burbank, we find out Chuck's sister and brother-in-law, Ellie and Devon are due for a child. Meanwhile, Chuck really wants to move things up with Sarah and pop the old question, and get the rest of his family back together in time.After i was finished watching this, i was relieved to hear that Chuck would be up for a 5th and final season, and of course, the worry of what will happen this season is in check. If watching this 4th season of Sarah taking it upon herself to try to save Chuck from a psychopath who wants the intersect for himself, or Chuck and Sarah's adventures alone wasnt enough for you with this season, well wait till season 5 begins. . .",5,JOSH SCHWARTZ AND CHRIS FEDAK HAVE DONE IT AGAIN!!!,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,1657,"['awesome', 'season', 'Chuck', 'hatch', 'had', 'worries', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'seen', 'season', '4', 'i', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'fan', 'Chuck', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'same-old', 'comedy', 'existed', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'remain', 'intact', 'fresh', 'continuing', 'new', 'story', 'Chuck', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'running', 'episodes', 'always', 'worry', 'new', 'seasons', 'there', '.Chuck', 'back', 'around', 'clumsy', 'lovable', 'hero', 'gone', 'unknown', 'computer', 'geek', 'fresh', 'new', 'spy', 'Intersect', 'got', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'Sarah', 'Walker', 'waits', 'work', 'everyday', 'Newcomers', 'who', 'need', 'initiation', 'series', 'better', 'remedy', 'watching', 'seasons', '1-3', 'cuz', 'season', 'not', 'gon', 'have', 'time', 'play', 'catch', 'up', 'Season', '4', 'pretty', 'much', 'where', 'season', '3', 'had', 'ended', 'Chuck', 'find', 'mother', 'piece', 'together', 'mystery', 'disappearance', 'life', 'young', 'age', 'Morgan', 'Sarah', 'John', 'agree', 'help', 'do', 'exactly', 'back', 'sunny', 'place', 'Burbank', 'find', 'out', 'Chuck', 'sister', 'brother-in-law', 'Ellie', 'Devon', 'are', 'due', 'child', 'Meanwhile', 'Chuck', 'really', 'move', 'things', 'up', 'Sarah', 'pop', 'old', 'question', 'get', 'rest', 'family', 'back', 'together', 'time.After', 'i', 'was', 'finished', 'watching', 'i', 'was', 'relieved', 'hear', 'Chuck', 'would', 'be', 'up', '5th', 'final', 'season', 'course', 'worry', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'season', 'check', 'watching', '4th', 'season', 'Sarah', 'taking', 'try', 'save', 'Chuck', 'psychopath', 'who', 'intersect', 'Chuck', 'Sarah', 'adventures', 'alone', 'wasnt', 'enough', 'season', 'well', 'wait', 'till', 'season', '5', 'begins']",Chuck:S4 (DVD)

This season was no exception, although it seems that the writers had a harder time writing it. There is some back-story that explains why this season isn't as strong as the first ones: apparently it was on the chopping block at NBC, despite the fact it was one of their strongest shows. The fans of this show are amazing though, and have brought it back for yet another season by means of a grass roots campaign for Subway and some of the other advertisers. I like to think that I played a tiny part of this, buy buying the DVDs for the first three seasons, preordering season 4, and writing a few emails to NBC executives.

Nice guy computer nerd and newly minted CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levi) is finally teamed, both personally and professionally, with the lovely and deadly CIA agent Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski).At the beginning of Season Four, Chuck and best buddy Morgan (Joshua Gomez) search for Chuck's long missing mother Mary Bartkowski (extended cameo by Linda Hamilton), thought to be a rogue agent working for the villainous international arms dealer Alexei Volkov (a superbly over-the-top Timothy Dalton).  In a multi-episode sequence, Chuck, Morgan, Sara and the famously gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin) track and eventually confront Mary Bartkowski and Volkov.  Mary's loyalties are something of a mystery, especially after she deprives Chuck of the use of the Intersect embedded in his brain, which provides him with his spy skills.Season Four was originally scheduled for 13 episodes, before being extended to a full season.  Lucky fans get two season finales.  In the first, Team Bartkowski tries to protect Chuck's sister Ellie from the Volkov gang, as she prepares to give birth to her first child with husband Captain Awesome, and as Chuck seeks a quiet moment to propose to the evasive Sara.  In the second, Chuck and Sara must escape the revenge of the Volkov family long enough to bring off their own wedding.The steam could easily have gone out of the series after Chuck and Sara finally got together, but the creative team of Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak keeps finding ways to keep it funny and interesting.  Any number of boomer TV series and movie dramas get hilariously ripped off this season, while a parallel storyline has Casey and Morgan as mismatched house mates and agent partners, with Morgan trying to keep secret his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.""Chuck: The Complete Fourth Season"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series.",5,All in the Family...,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,2002,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'fourth', 'season', 'Chuck', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'blend', 'drama', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Nice', 'guy', 'computer', 'nerd', 'newly', 'minted', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Chuck', 'Bartkowski', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'finally', 'teamed', 'personally', 'professionally', 'lovely', 'deadly', 'CIA', 'agent', 'Sara', 'Walker', 'Yvonne', 'Strahovski', '.At', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Four', 'Chuck', 'best', 'buddy', 'Morgan', 'Joshua', 'Gomez', 'search', 'Chuck', 'long', 'missing', 'mother', 'Mary', 'Bartkowski', 'extended', 'cameo', 'Linda', 'Hamilton', 'thought', 'be', 'rogue', 'agent', 'working', 'villainous', 'international', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Alexei', 'Volkov', 'superbly', 'over-the-top', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'multi-episode', 'sequence', 'Chuck', 'Morgan', 'Sara', 'famously', 'gruff', 'NSA', 'agent', 'John', 'Casey', 'Adam', 'Baldwin', 'track', 'eventually', 'confront', 'Mary', 'Bartkowski', 'Volkov', 'Mary', 'loyalties', 'are', 'something', 'mystery', 'especially', 'Chuck', 'use', 'Intersect', 'embedded', 'brain', 'spy', 'skills.Season', 'Four', 'was', 'originally', 'scheduled', '13', 'episodes', 'being', 'extended', 'full', 'season', 'Lucky', 'fans', 'get', 'two', 'season', 'finales', 'first', 'Team', 'Bartkowski', 'protect', 'Chuck', 'sister', 'Ellie', 'Volkov', 'gang', 'give', 'birth', 'first', 'child', 'husband', 'Captain', 'Awesome', 'Chuck', 'quiet', 'moment', 'propose', 'evasive', 'Sara', 'second', 'Chuck', 'Sara', 'must', 'escape', 'revenge', 'Volkov', 'family', 'long', 'enough', 'bring', 'off', 'own', 'wedding.The', 'steam', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'gone', 'series', 'Chuck', 'Sara', 'finally', 'got', 'together', 'creative', 'team', 'Josh', 'Schwartz', 'Chris', 'Fedak', 'finding', 'ways', 'keep', 'funny', 'interesting', 'number', 'boomer', 'TV', 'series', 'movie', 'dramas', 'get', 'hilariously', 'ripped', 'off', 'season', 'parallel', 'storyline', 'Casey', 'Morgan', 'mismatched', 'house', 'mates', 'agent', 'partners', 'Morgan', 'trying', 'keep', 'secret', 'relationship', 'Casey', 'daughter', 'Alex', 'Chuck', 'Complete', 'Fourth', 'Season', 'very', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'series']",Chuck:S4 (DVD)

1359935,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B003R0MF5I,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[33, 33]","Every new fall season, there's this fear that my favorite TV shows wouldn't be on the roster. With CHUCK getting the nod for a fifth and final season, there's a sigh of relief. It's very hard for me to be impartial and critique this show. And I won't even try, really. But, okay, maybe I'll mention that perhaps CHUCK's getting only one more season may be a good thing. In Season 4, there's been a creeping sense of familiarity, a nagging worry that maybe, just maybe, the show's slowing down some.It's still a cool premise, hapless nerd secretly a brilliant spy. And the cast still demonstrates that banging chemistry. But the central tension always was in Chuck and Sarah's relationship. Once they formally became a couple in Season 3, I was happy as pigs in mud but also concerned about where the show would go from here on out, what with that central conflict being resolved. Remember what happened to MOONLIGHTING once David and Maddy hooked up?But CHUCK isn't all about a nerd's hopeless romantic pinings. And, in the area of wicked espionage and devilish plot twists and just plain exploiting the Intersect, the show exhibits plenty of legs. In Season 3's finale, Chuck had promised his sister that he's out of the spy game for good, and I think we all got a good snicker out of that. Like a phoenix from the ashes or a cockroach shrugging off the holocaust, the Burbank Buy More store is back, rebuilt and revamped and become a full-fledged, covert joint NSA/CIA operation. Because when Chuck Bartowski doesn't come to the spy game, the spy game comes to Chuck Bartowski.It's all a subterfuge, of course, his fellow spies assuming that Chuck had quit espionage, with Sarah pulling off missions with John Casey while Chuck frets at home. But Chuck is up to something. He's following leads on his long-thought-to-be-dead mother, with Morgan as his only backup. The subterfuge lasts only during the season opener, though. And, somewhere in this first episode, for fun, we get ""sexting"" between Chuck and Sarah, except that it's really between Morgan and an unwitting Sarah (ugh!). Chuck and Morgan even find time to attend a hand-to-hand combat class in, uh, ""strip-kick,"" a discipline which combines the ""self-defense of Krav Maga with the intense core workout of pole dancing."" Heh.The rest of Season 4 tracks Chuck's search for his mom and the agents' ongoing mission to take down Volkoff Industries, a new criminal organization. Just about each episode explores a facet of Chuck and Sarah's relationship, ranging from their first fight as a couple to their inability to air out their feelings to why Sarah refuses to bring personal mementos with her on missions. But the show doesn't neglect its other characters, whether it's John Casey's own relationship with his daughter or Awesome and Ellie's pregnancy or Morgan's gradual inclusion into the inner circle (Morgan more or less worms his way in).Viewing CHUCK is like going to fan boy heaven. It's a big get, casting Linda Hamilton as Chuck's mom. Another nice conceit is that the new BuyMore regularly rotates a roster of agents whose name tag is always ""Greta."" For the first few episodes, each week unveiled a new star cameo. So we see ""Greta"" being played by the likes of geek goddess Olivia Munn, Summer Glau, and even by the Old Spice guy. For villains, we get familiar sorts like Timothy Dalton, Lou Ferrigno, Richard Chamberlain, and Dolph Lundgren (who even quotes his famous Ivan Drago line).Another thing I love about CHUCK is that it never hesitates to upend the status quo. I love the unpredictability of the episodes. The characters evolve (well, maybe not Jeffster), and, as for Chuck's mom, for plenty of episodes, I wasn't entirely certain which side she'd fall on. At this stage, the challenge is how to keep Chuck Bartowski a total badasss on the field while still retaining his nerd creds. Thank goodness you can't totally shed your neuroses. I guess if you're a sorry bloke what happened to land a smoking hot girlfriend, chances are there's a part of you that'll always be insecure. Except that, lately, Chuck's development hasn't been as arrested.Just about each episode is terrific, but I did like some better than others, and here's a SPOILERS alert. In ""Chuck Vs. The Cat Squad,"" Chuck reunites Sarah with her old spy team. I love ""Chuck Vs. Phase Three"" because it reaffirms Sarah Walker's badassery. I love that a legend builds around Sarah as she carves a swath thru the jungles of Southeast Asia, beating up on guy after guy in her quest to find an Intersect-less Chuck. ""Chuck Vs. The Muuurder"" challenges Chuck's leadership skills when he's put in charge of a crucial mission, and then a murder mystery surfaces. And in ""Chuck Vs. The Wedding Planner,"" Chuck and Sarah are scammed out of their wedding money and Sarah reluctantly goes to her con man dad to get the money back.Despite mad support from its ardent fans, CHUCK, each season, has been on the brink of cancellation, so it's amazing and really gratifying that it's lasted this long. And, dammit, you know what, I take back what I said earlier. This show isn't in danger of growing stale. The stories are too inventive, the cast is too good, the humor too water cooler, and the hook simply too irresistible. Hell yes to Season 5. That new car smell forever!!This DVD set comes with 5 discs with the following bonus stuff:- 18 Declassified Scenes (also known as Deleted/Extended Scenes)- ""Buy Hard: The Jeff & Lester Story: The

Chuck is one of the most creative concepts on television. I don't want to spoil the story so I won't say much. All I will say is that it is very well written and does not include many cliches. The show is unpredictable and includes many twists and turns. The acting on Chuck is very good. Each actor plays their character perfectly and I wouldn't make any adjustments to the cast. All the actors seem extremely comfortable in their roles. Whoever did the casting is very talented. Chuck is a good mix of action and comedy. The action sequences are intense and the hand to hand combat is wonderful. It is very addicting and fun to watch. Their is a dash of romance but is in no way over the top. If you have not watched the first three seasons then I highly suggest you watch those before this. You can still catch on to the story and enjoy Chuck if you start this season, but you will miss a lot of backstories that make the characters even more likable. In Season 4, we learn a lot more about Chuck and Sarah's relationship. New characters are also introduced. Season 4 is a great addition to the Chuck series. I would like to see much more of Casey and Morgan in the next season. We saw a lot of them in the first three seasons and even in this seasson but I still think they have much more to offer. I think we will see more of Morgan based on the Cliffhanger but I won't ruin anything. One of the best things about this season is that we get to dive even deeper into the characters and learn even more about their pasts. Overall, Chuck is one of the best shows on television. Everything is outstanding and I cannot believe this show doesn't have more fans. I can't wait for season 5.
