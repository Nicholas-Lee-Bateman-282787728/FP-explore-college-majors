I liked that it was not a Hollywood production and had a real feeling to it. Yet, I kinda missed a wow-factor, something that would help me remember the movie. I would recommend it to people who want to see something different that the typical glamor-losing-weight Hollywood story.",4,"Missing WOW-factor, but good entertainment",1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2014,364,"['gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'had', 'good', 'story', 'development', 'good', 'actors', 'liked', 'was', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'had', 'real', 'feeling', 'kinda', 'missed', 'wow-factor', 'something', 'would', 'help', 'remember', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'something', 'different', 'typical', 'glamor-losing-weight', 'Hollywood', 'story']",A Big Love Story

But about 3/4 of the way into the movie it froze my system and required an unplug to get out of it.  Trying again it was the same problem.  Waiting several days to try again had the same frustrating situation.  Other movies have run fine.  An Amazon problem with this particular film?,2,ui,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,333,"['Actually', 'what', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'was', 'good', '3/4', 'way', 'movie', 'froze', 'system', 'required', 'unplug', 'get', 'Trying', 'again', 'was', 'same', 'problem', 'Waiting', 'several', 'days', 'try', 'again', 'had', 'same', 'frustrating', 'situation', 'Other', 'movies', 'have', 'run', 'fine', 'Amazon', 'problem', 'particular', 'film']",A Big Love Story

Thoroughly taking us along their journey which is filled with warmth and humorous enjoyment, I found myself smiling long after the credits rolled.
