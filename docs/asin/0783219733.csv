It is about this St. Bernard named Beethoven who finds a home. The kids and mother like Beethoven but the father doesn't. It also involves an evil veterinarian that kidnaps dogs and then does illegal experimentations on them. It may be a little dark for younger kids but it is heartwarming and funny. I think Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt did an excellent job with their roles as parents of 3 children. I wish I had a St. Bernard like Beethoven even though he drools and makes a mess in the house.

Before the lovable St. Bernard entered the Newton household,it was completely flawless. Beethoven broke free from a truck enroute to a homeless shelter and happened to gain the attention of George,his wife Alice(Bonnie Hunt) and their children Ryce,Ted and Emily. The mutt got his name from some music played by kindergarten-age Emily,composed by the late classical music great Ludwig von Beethoven. In fact,Emily was playing ""A Fifth of Beethoven"". At first,the Newtons were reading ballots trying to come up with names. Alice immediately recognized Emily's ballot,written in crayon. ""Body parts would not make good names for the dog."",Alice tells Emily. Emily replies,""He has one of those. I looked."" Also,""That's what you call Uncle Richard."". Emily knew the slang term for the male sexual organ! Other memorable scenes include the Newton kids being babysat by an incapable woman(Alice fired her after only one job). Also Beethoven ""giving a ride to"" a pair of inept,deceitful people who are business associates of George's. Beethoven was physically abused by a homeless shelter worker posing as a veterinarian. Emily personally saw the guy hit the mutt. At first,the others thought Beethoven bit the guy. George was gonna have the mutt euthanized but the mutt is saved. The so-called villain and his partner were indicted on a multitude of counts of animal cruelty. The other animals in the shelter were rescued by the Newtons. The Newtons also appeared in the TV coverage of the crime. In the last scene,George,Alice and the kids are all together with the rescued animals including Beethoven. What a sweet,happy ending! Director Brian Levant's other film credits include 1991's PROBLEM CHILD 2 and 1994's THE FLINTSTONES.

48126,A2582KMXLK2P06,0783219733,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","It's unfortunate that Beethoven hasn't become a classic because I remember back in the day it was an *extremely* popular family film.  You see 20 years ago, comedies pertaining to dogs and cats wasn't yet beaten into the ground to the point of being predictably bland so the viewers were able to better appreciate them.  Perhaps that explains why this film isn't considered a classic- there's too many similar types out there these days.Anyway, I'm not the biggest fan of Saint Bernards because they slobber a lot and actually strike me as the kind of dog that can suddenly turn vicious without giving warning (perhaps I'm wrong about that- hey, every dog is brought up differently) but when they're puppies it's impossible to deny just how adorable and surprisingly small they are.  I really enjoy the puppy segment in the beginning, especially the perfect timing of Beethoven hiding in a trashcan at just the right moment so the dognappers couldn't find him.  Oh, and we can't forget that biker chick who walked into the pet store looking for something suitable for her personality only to have a certain... disgusting incident happen, hehe.This is the kind of well-written family movie where numerous scenes remain extremely memorable to me over the years, so the entire film flows with so much great humor and perfect timing.  Who can possibly forget the scene when the husband/father walks through the front door, sees muddy dog footprints all over his floor and carpet, and ventures upstairs only to be the victim of the greatest slobbering surprise of his life!  Nowadays I realize they exaggerated the amount of slobber flying around in every which direction, but back in the day I thought this segment was quite realistic, haha.  A similar incredibly funny segment that will probably make you laugh uncontrollably is when Beethoven hops into bed with the husband, unbeknownst to him, and Beethoven starts licking his face.  He believes it's his wife doing it, lol!  Perhaps a mildly inappropriate moment, I admit.I definitely do not like the one scene with the bad guy walking up to Beethoven's doghouse and deliberately trying to get Beethoven to attack him so he has a good excuse to put the dog down.  I know when the movie was being written the actors were actually playfully teasing the dog (and you can tell because Beethoven is wagging his tail the entire time) but to me it looks frighteningly realistic like animal abuse.  Also the scene where the camera is positioned through a living room window showing the little girl of Beethoven's family falling into the swimming pool and nearly drowning while the babysitter is occupied playing the piano and totally unaware what's taking place outside is VERY uncomfortable for me to watch.  Another unintentionally realistic moment.Other memorable scenes include those two business people who not only get a spitty-tasting glass of lemonade, but receive a chair-flipping (and perfectly timed landing) adventure of a lifetime, haha.  Oh, and the bacon-stealing scene at the kitchen table is great too.The film is incredibly brief though, at just over 80 minutes.  It felt so much longer to me back in the day.I don't know, Beethoven just seems like such a perfect comedy to me with no flaws.

Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt are cast superbly as the suburban parents of three children who come across an orphaned dog (Beethoven).  Of course Charles Grodin doesn't want any of this, and the change which he goes through until the end is wonderful.

After watching this movie even the person in your family who is not an animal lover will want to go out and adopt a St.Bernard!It starts when Beethoven is just a puppy by narrowingly escaping a pet store robbery Beethoven wanders the streets until he enters the lives of the Newton family. After Emily Newton the youngest member of the clan awakes in the morning to see a cute little fluffy St. Bernard puppy in her bed ""I dreamt I had a puppy and my dream came true."" George and Alice Newton are besides themselves on what to do with the dog- they can't keep it is George's first reaction. It will ruin the yard, destroy the house, it will grow to be enormous, and then it will die and we'll have to replace it and start the whole process all over again. Well George despite, being an a non-dog person decides to keep it for the sake of the kids ""It's just temporary"" he says. But, soon Beethoven the lovable St.Bernard becomes a member of the family- dealing with all childhood crisises from bullies and to first crushes- as this happens he also gets REALLLY big creating huge messes that George Newton reluctantly puts up with! Well, Beethoven is a very special dog with a remarkable love for his family sensing danger for the Newtons from saving George from the finical ruin of his company to the near death drowning of little Emily. But, suddenly Beethoven finds himself in the grips of an villianious vet who wants to use him to test out a new gun anumition on- only problem is the Newton family isn't going to give Beethoven up with out a fight! Even George loves the creature now.This movie made my eleven year old host sister roll over on the floor with laughter. And seeing it made me want to go out and adopt a St.Bernard puppy. Charles Gordin is HILLAROUS as the anti-dog loving George in this movie his facial expressions and tone of voice reminded me of my dad's dealings with our family pet. Charles Gordin totally carries this movie. The animals also make this flick really endearing-All in all this is a movie to rent or buy to watch with your kids over and over again!

48146,AYMZTWBG0V53W,0783219733,"Leslie Karen Rigsbey ""Leslie Rigsbey""","[1, 1]","&#34;Beethoven&#34; will most likely make a kid out of you for life if you really enjoy the movie, and, realistically, it is difficult not to. Its plot might be lighter than a Bloho the Clown cluster of balloons, but it makes several good points for a family-friendly, light-hearted entertainment vehicle. In other words, this is not your typical, more recent type of ignorance fest that is par for course for Hollywood output. (Most modern movies are simply feces in disguise.) No, &#34;Beethoven&#34; takes a more interesting look at animal experimentation and explores the theme of animal mistreatment and, surprisingly, it really doesn't slough it off as harmless. While the script is rather light (as it was intended to be), it is at least aware of the cruelty and suffering that goes on frequently in this world of ours. But with a likable star (the dog!), and a rather touching music score (well, it is), &#34;Beethoven&#34; is a movie that I can watch even now, when I've grown older, more cynical, and more discriminate. &#34;Major Payne&#34; belongs in the past. &#34;Beethoven&#34; belongs any time.With its run of thoroughly enjoyable performances (Charles Grodin has a unique quality as an actor, one that I feel is overlooked by critics, in that he can elevate almost any material to its appropriate level of humor without making you feel you've lost brain cells by enjoying it), including a nasty turn by the Dean (Jones) himself, and a presentation of mostly likeable people/characters on hand, this is one to treasure. Most summer popcorn movies are disposable (as they are intended to be), and most kid-friendly films are made for their time to appeal to the current viewing audience. But &#34;Beethoven&#34; is something better. You'd do well to hang on to it if you are building a solid collection of movies. It is proof that not all &#34;light&#34; movies have to be dumb, or insensitive. The image and sound on the DVD is fine, not far removed from a decent VHS copy, but the film is so enjoyable it's hard to demand much more from it.
