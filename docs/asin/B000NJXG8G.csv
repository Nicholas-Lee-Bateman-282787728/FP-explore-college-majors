There is no other sci fi show like doctor who in the world it is unique and never will be duplicated, americans have tried but, lets be honest this show is suited for people who are mentaly on the ball and who have an attention span of more than just ten minutes. sure there have been people who have scoffed at this show pointing out at its shortcomings in regards to special affects, overacting, and costume malfunctions but, it is the beauty of the imaginative and inovative stories that have captavated millions of fans across the world which makes up for those shortcomings. I will always love doctor who because this show makes you look at life through the eyes of child full of wonder and bright promise, this show also got me seriously interested in science another plus.

I was surprised how strong Keeper of Traken still isPicture and sound are superb.Bonus features are a mixed bag.  The commentary tracks are highly entertaining (Tom Baker rarely does commentary, and was in top form here) but the behind-the-scenes featurettes don't really offer much information fans aren't already likely to know.All in all, this package is well worth the price.",5,"Out with the old Who, in with the new",1184457600,"07 15, 2007",2007,830,"['Doctor', 'Who', 'fan', 'well-acquainted', 'trilogy', 'stories', 're-introduction', 'Master', 'introduction', 'rather', 'tragic', 'companion', 'Nyssa', 'Traken', 'introduction', 'bossy', 'Australian', 'Tegan', 'Jovanka', 'regeneration', 'Fourth', 'Doctor', 'Fifth', 'handover', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Peter', 'Davison.The', 'stories', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'fairly', 'well', 'sometimes', 'require', 'much', 'suspending', 'belief', 'make', 'click', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'strong', 'Keeper', 'Traken', 'still', 'isPicture', 'sound', 'are', 'superb.Bonus', 'features', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'rarely', 'commentary', 'was', 'top', 'form', 'here', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'offer', 'much', 'information', 'fans', 'are', ""n't"", 'already', 'likely', 'know.All', 'package', 'well', 'price']",N/A
1057643,A19WQTX0CP8QVG,B000NJXG8G,Benjamin Cucueco,"[1, 1]","Let me write short about Tom Baker 4th Doctor then I move over to Peter Davison as 5th Doctor.The 4th Doctor and Adric had left Romana and k9 in E-Space from Warriors Gate. And they landed on the planet Traken. You see introduction of Nyssa played by actress Sarah Sutton. The old Keeper reappered in the TARDIS and back in his throne in Traken. The giant statue Melkur was controlled by The Master. Very hard to understand. In the end Nyssa grandfather or old father touched the clock and The Master transferred to his body in the end.Logopolis, you get to see Teagan Jovanka, played by actress Janet Fielding. Teagan and her aunt were about to leave Australia, then tire got flat. The Master murdered Teagan aunt turning her into a tiny plastic doll. Correct me if I'm wrong.In Logopolis, in planet Earth, Adric and 4th Docor were spotted by this white ghost called The Watcher.Interesting part is when Teagan entered inside The TARDIS. She been running around the corridors and even the garden. I remember  there are numerous TARDIS inside the TARDIS. Being tricked by THE MASTER..What I learned in planet Logopolis. Is that the people never sleep, and keep working nonstop, thru mathematical abucus in computers. Teagan barely know The 4th Doctor and Adric. And Nyssa suddenly appeared out of nowhere saying she been transported from her home planet Traken to Logopolis.Nyssa thought her father still alive. Yet a younger version of him was taken over. Actor Anthony Ainley played the old father of Nyssa, then became The Master.Tom Baker temporarily had 3 new companions. Adric, Nyssa and Teagan. On Earth, The Doctor and The Master were fighting on top of the satellite building. As Tom Baker fell off, All 3 companions, or partners in travel sit by his side.The regeneration is good to see. Because The Watcher glides thru Tom Baker 4th Doctor body, and the face suddenly transfers to Peter Davison 5th Doctor.When I watched Castrovalva? It's looks like a whole different saga. The pictures got more brighter. The police spotted all 4 of them. Adric tries to distract the police officers. Teagan and Nyssa temporarly drove the ambulance van. and all 4 came inside the TARDIS.The 5th Doctor Peter Davison is interesting to watch. Because not only he is yound. He became more peacful, very mellow trying to find his own new personality. He took off that scarf, and wore a nice suit with celery attached. His joy of playing cricket. Adric was kidnapped by The Master in a web like trap. The castle of Castrovalva looks interesting. The 5th Doctor was inside this healing room. And Teagan and Nyssa created a coffin like to rest the Doctor.Out of all these 3 Stories, I like Castrovalva the best. I already watch it twice. I guess I better watch Castrovalva numerous times. And jot down notes. So next time, I can type a much more clearer decent story about it. Besides my summarized nonsense.Castrovalva gave me a feeling to enjoy watching more about the 5th Doctor. Tom Baker is an excellent 4th Doctor in all due respect. Peter Davison is my fave end of story.Honestly, I watch more 5th Doctor episoded, because I find both Sarah Sutton and Janet Fielding to be very attractive. Nyssa is very chill and calm. While Teagan is the one who always wines and complains. Same goes for Adric, Who doesn't get enough attention.It's good the 5th Doctor has 3 potential traveling companions along. Too bad Adric got blown into pieces in Earthshock. Nyssa remained in this giant ship called Terminus. Teagan decided not to travel anymore. Due to what happened in Resurrection of The Daleks.",5,End of Tom Baker as 4th Doctor and Beginning of Peter Davison as 5th Doctor,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",2013,3585,"['Let', 'write', 'short', 'Tom', 'Baker', '4th', 'Doctor', 'then', 'move', 'Peter', 'Davison', '5th', 'Doctor.The', '4th', 'Doctor', 'Adric', 'had', 'left', 'Romana', 'k9', 'E-Space', 'Warriors', 'Gate', 'landed', 'planet', 'Traken', 'see', 'introduction', 'Nyssa', 'played', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Sutton', 'old', 'Keeper', 'reappered', 'TARDIS', 'back', 'throne', 'Traken', 'giant', 'statue', 'Melkur', 'was', 'controlled', 'Master', 'Very', 'hard', 'understand', 'end', 'Nyssa', 'grandfather', 'old', 'father', 'touched', 'clock', 'Master', 'transferred', 'body', 'end.Logopolis', 'get', 'see', 'Teagan', 'Jovanka', 'played', 'actress', 'Janet', 'Fielding', 'Teagan', 'aunt', 'were', 'about', 'leave', 'Australia', 'then', 'tire', 'got', 'flat', 'Master', 'murdered', 'Teagan', 'aunt', 'turning', 'tiny', 'plastic', 'doll', 'Correct', ""'m"", 'wrong.In', 'Logopolis', 'planet', 'Earth', 'Adric', '4th', 'Docor', 'were', 'spotted', 'white', 'ghost', 'called', 'Watcher.Interesting', 'part', 'when', 'Teagan', 'entered', 'TARDIS', 'been', 'running', 'around', 'corridors', 'even', 'garden', 'remember', 'are', 'numerous', 'TARDIS', 'TARDIS', 'Being', 'tricked', 'THE', 'MASTER..What', 'learned', 'planet', 'Logopolis', 'people', 'never', 'sleep', 'keep', 'working', 'nonstop', 'thru', 'mathematical', 'abucus', 'computers', 'Teagan', 'barely', 'know', '4th', 'Doctor', 'Adric', 'Nyssa', 'suddenly', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'saying', 'been', 'transported', 'home', 'planet', 'Traken', 'Logopolis.Nyssa', 'thought', 'father', 'still', 'alive', 'younger', 'version', 'was', 'taken', 'over', 'Actor', 'Anthony', 'Ainley', 'played', 'old', 'father', 'Nyssa', 'then', 'became', 'Master.Tom', 'Baker', 'temporarily', 'had', '3', 'new', 'companions', 'Adric', 'Nyssa', 'Teagan', 'Earth', 'Doctor', 'Master', 'were', 'fighting', 'top', 'satellite', 'building', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'fell', 'off', '3', 'companions', 'partners', 'travel', 'sit', 'side.The', 'regeneration', 'good', 'see', 'Watcher', 'glides', 'thru', 'Tom', 'Baker', '4th', 'Doctor', 'body', 'face', 'suddenly', 'Peter', 'Davison', '5th', 'Doctor.When', 'watched', 'Castrovalva', 'whole', 'different', 'saga', 'pictures', 'got', 'more', 'brighter', 'police', 'spotted', '4', 'Adric', 'tries', 'distract', 'police', 'officers', 'Teagan', 'Nyssa', 'temporarly', 'drove', 'ambulance', 'van', '4', 'came', 'TARDIS.The', '5th', 'Doctor', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'interesting', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'yound', 'became', 'more', 'peacful', 'very', 'mellow', 'trying', 'find', 'own', 'new', 'personality', 'took', 'off', 'scarf', 'wore', 'nice', 'suit', 'celery', 'attached', 'joy', 'playing', 'cricket', 'Adric', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Master', 'web', 'trap', 'castle', 'Castrovalva', 'interesting', '5th', 'Doctor', 'was', 'healing', 'room', 'Teagan', 'Nyssa', 'created', 'coffin', 'rest', 'Doctor.Out', '3', 'Stories', 'like', 'Castrovalva', 'best', 'already', 'watch', 'twice', 'guess', 'better', 'watch', 'Castrovalva', 'numerous', 'times', 'jot', 'down', 'notes', 'next', 'time', 'can', 'type', 'much', 'more', 'clearer', 'decent', 'story', 'summarized', 'nonsense.Castrovalva', 'gave', 'feeling', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'more', '5th', 'Doctor', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'excellent', '4th', 'Doctor', 'due', 'respect', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'fave', 'end', 'story.Honestly', 'watch', 'more', '5th', 'Doctor', 'episoded', 'find', 'Sarah', 'Sutton', 'Janet', 'Fielding', 'be', 'very', 'attractive', 'Nyssa', 'very', 'chill', 'calm', 'Teagan', 'one', 'who', 'always', 'wines', 'complains', 'Same', 'Adric', 'Who', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'attention.It', 'good', '5th', 'Doctor', '3', 'potential', 'traveling', 'companions', 'along', 'Too', 'bad', 'Adric', 'got', 'blown', 'pieces', 'Earthshock', 'Nyssa', 'remained', 'giant', 'ship', 'called', 'Terminus', 'Teagan', 'decided', 'not', 'travel', 'anymore', 'Due', 'what', 'happened', 'Resurrection', 'Daleks']",N/A

Starbuck,"[2, 5]","As a huge fan of the Classic Series and one who is just now beginning to build up my DVD collection, I have to say I am quite excited for this set. I grew up watching Doctor Who on PBS and Tom Baker was my first Doctor, so I was very sad when he left the program, but I quickly warmed up to Peter Davison and loved the characters of Adric, Nyssa and Tegan. These three stories are three of my all-time favorites, especially ""The Keeper of Traken,"" which introduces Nyssa and hails the return of The Master. In these three stories, The Master is not quite the caricature that he was in later stories, which is fitting for the Doctor's arch enemy. It would be interesting to see them bring him back in the new series.",5,Very excited for this one!,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,715,"['huge', 'fan', 'Classic', 'Series', 'one', 'who', 'just', 'now', 'beginning', 'build', 'up', 'DVD', 'collection', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'quite', 'excited', 'set', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'PBS', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'was', 'first', 'Doctor', 'was', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'left', 'program', 'quickly', 'warmed', 'up', 'Peter', 'Davison', 'loved', 'characters', 'Adric', 'Nyssa', 'Tegan', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'three', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'especially', 'Keeper', 'Traken', 'Nyssa', 'return', 'Master', 'three', 'stories', 'Master', 'not', 'quite', 'caricature', 'was', 'later', 'stories', 'fitting', 'Doctor', 'arch', 'enemy', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'bring', 'back', 'new', 'series']",N/A

Perhaps I had seen a bit here or there before, but I wasn't interested. In fact I didn't get interested until the woman in my life at the time watched it regularly. Once you get into it, it is like eating the single potatoe chip or french frie. Next to impossible. Over the years I have seen the vast majority of the episodes. I myself prefer the color episodes. Not just because the color is better, the sets are better, the special effects are better, but because I thought the men playing the doctors were better actors and had more fun with the part. I saw some true creativity that made me watch even when the make-up and costumes were laughable.This three DVD set is a nice combination of the end of Tom Baker as Doctor Who and the beginning of Peter Davison's stint. Both were two of the best doctors in the series, and these episodes were some of the better ones. Both actors went on to make other movies and series. I myself enjoyed Baker in his other movies and Davison as ""Campion"". But I will say I am partial to these two doctors. I think Baker, Davison, and Pertwee were the most entertaining of all the doctors. Since many of the series episodes are being sold singly for over $18 each, this set of three is very reasonable. So if you enjoy Doctor Who this is a must and if you are new to the series this is a great introduction at a good price.

The word means many things depending on the context, but in ""Doctor Who"" it really only means one thing: one actor quits and another starts.There's been ten cannonical Doctors (not counting Peter Cushing fromThe Doctor Who Collection, the Valyard, the Shakala Doctor or the various Doctors present inDoctor Who - The Curse of Fatal Death). They've all had their various strengths. Some we saw for far fewer stories than we would've liked (Colin Baker, Paul McGann and Christopher Eccleston leap to mind), while some might feel that certain other ones overstayed their welcome.Like many people, particularly those of us in America, my introduction to the series came with Tom Baker. There's no doubt that in many ways he was the most charasmatic and accessible of the ""classic"" Doctors. He is also, to date, the longest lasting of the Doctors, having a seven year run in the TARDIS.Sadly, all good things must end, and the 4th Doctor's run comes to an end in this DVD series. ""Keeper of Traken"" sets up the events of ""Logopolis"" which end with us getting a brand-new Doctor, Peter Davidson. His adventures begin in earnest with ""Castrovalva"".Also of note is the fact that the Master, the Doctor's ""best enemy"", and gone from the scene for quite a while, makes a major return in these episodes, which also introduce Teagan and Nyssa while firming up the character of Adric (speaking of firm... is it just me, or in the scenes where the Master has him in his little web, does Adric seem to be enjoying himself just a little too much? Like as in, ""Is that sonic-screwdriver in your pocket or...?"" Probably just my imagination. Still, I can dream). Adric was one of the first male TV characters I developed a major crush on in my teen years, along with Wesley Crusher. Still, the less said about both, the better.The DVDs are well done as always, featuring a great deal of commentary on every episode (tragicaly, we can hear that Anthony Ainley was clearly on his last legs when he did his commentary. He sounds not like he's at Death's door but has, to steal from Pratchett, stepped into the foyer and is admiring the carpet and hat stand). The amount of extras on these DVDs are the sort of thing I wish more TV series would incorporate (I'm looking at YOU, Star Trek DVDs!).All in all, this is a must-own if you're a fan of the series.

1057648,A11GO5VA74HD8K,B000NJXG8G,Crazy Fox,"[8, 8]","It will be hard for Doctor Who fans not to heed the call of this excellent DVD set, for the Time Lords, they are a-changin'. Indeed, the three storylines included here work as a whole to mark a pivotal shift in the show's development in the early 1980's. True, each story is to some degree self-contained and episodic in terms of location, plot, and concept, and yet all three flow together into a loosely-structured trilogy of sorts thematically unified by regeneration and renewal--first, ominously enough, of evil, as the Doctor's fellow Time Lord and arch-nemesis the Master cheats death and decay by using an innocent man's life force to rejuvenate himself (henceforth he'll become a regular villain in the series for years). But then even more significantly, the Doctor himself is fatally injured in the Master's schemes and must regenerate, thus marking the end of Tom Baker's long, much-loved, and virtually iconic tenure in the role and the beginning of Peter Davison's time at the Tardis console--for some, a key moment in the show's downfall, for others the start of a younger, fresher and more serious interpretation of the Doctor; opinions tend to divide sharply, which means this DVD set gets the added spice of a touch of controversy. And as if the Doctor and the Master weren't enough, there are other new beginnings here, too. Romana and K9 are gone. A new group of traveling companions gradually join the Doctor throughout this loose trilogy--as many as three in fact, which actually replaces the general formula (since 1970) of a single female companion with a demographic batch closer to the companion crews typical of the 1960's. Perhaps a bit crowded, but characters we'll see regularly for quite a while are introduced right here.All of this shuffling about would be pointless though if these weren't fine stories in their own right, and they are, each a well-written gem in its own way. ""The Keeper of Traken"" is a classic tale of deceitful serpents in paradisiacal gardens, complete with an imaginative vision of an alien society and a compelling blend of fantasy and sci-fi elements (plus some of the most fabulous costumes and sets you'll ever see on ""Doctor Who""). ""Logopolis"" successfully incorporates sophisticated mathematical and astrophysical concepts into a suspenseful tale of life and death; a riveting adventure full of foreboding, and yet this may well be ""Doctor Who"" at its most cerebral and conceptual in terms of science-fiction. And ""Castrovalva"" perhaps gets a little too abstract and brainy for its own good, but the surreal premise and M.C. Escher imagery is quite intriguing altogether and the attempt to realistically suggest the physiological shock of regeneration an interesting and risky plot device. In short, these are three fine ""Doctor Who"" storylines in their own right, and as a trilogy they represent a momentous shift in this long-running program. And they're all here, complete with insightful extras and nicely packaged in one spiffy box. There's a lot of uncertainty in the universe but no guesswork when it comes to this very excellent and enjoyable DVD set.P.S.

Season 18 (Tom Baker's last) was a particularly strong season, despite the actor's frustrations at a number of changes that were introduced to the show, and Baker seems at his finest in his two serials, the last of his run.  Peter Davison, for his part, also turns in a strong opening performance as he plays a newly regenerated Doctor (fans of the franchise will know that regeneration leaves the Doctor a bit unhinged and Davison does a great job of playing this up.)  Uniting the three stories is a certain recurring villain that gives the entire set very good flow.Baker had been extremely popular during his run of seven years (the longest up to that point and arguably the longest tenure still) so the writers of the show wisely took their time to set up the Doctor's transition, introducing new companions and the new status quo while Baker was still in command of the role and leaving ample room for Davison to lay claim to the plotlines that Baker had left behind.  Baker is also sent off with some rather touching flashbacks that reflect on his time on the show and all the adventures he had.Each story also manages to stand on its own, with each including a fairly strong plot with excellent supporting actors to carry the storylines.

The Doctor and Adric leaving E-Space and Romanna and K-9 behind are summoned by the Keeper of Traken an old man bound to a chair, but with the power of the whole of his planet at his call.  He tells the Doctor and Adric of a malevlent force that tried to invade Traken years ago called the Melkor but once it landed it became stone.  For no evil can destroy Traken or its people becase as the Doctor puts it ""Everyone is so terriable nice to one another"".  But that is not the reason for the summons.  The Keeper's life is nearly at an end.  And those who are on the council who rule Traken in the Keeper name must choose one of them to replace him.  The head council Tremas is the likely choice but his new wife also a member does not want this to happen.  She loves him to much to be seperated by the power of the Keeper.  She has a plan but is it her's or someone elses.  Soon enough the Doctor arrives and Traken is in chaos as death unlike which any seen before has happen.  They blame him, but Tremas and his daughter Nyssa think otherwise.  Can the Doctor clear his name, save Traken and ensure that the next Keeper will not let Traken down?In the next episode entitled ""Logopolis"" The Doctor is looking at his poor TARDIS.  Getting old and in need of repair.  He decides its time to get things in order but the TARDIS clositer bell begins to ring.  The Doctor worrys since that means immentant danger is at hand.  Regardless he takes Adric to Earth in the 20th century to try and find a police call box in North Wales to get the proper measurements he needs to get the TARDIS in order.  Meanwhile a young lady named Tegan trying to make her way to Heathrow airport with her aunt has a flat tire and happen to be near a police box.  Strange things begin to happen Tegan Aunt goes missing, The Doctor and Adric find themselves entering one Tardis into another without end and a strange man all in white who calls himself ""The Watcher"" watches the Doctor and the events unfolding around him.  The Doctor realizing he has no choice but to see things through heads to the planet Logopolis where there the greatest mathmatics are preformed by the people who live on the planet. The Doctor is happy to get the TARDIS back in shape, meanwhile Adric makes a discovery in the form of Nyssa from Traken.  She said her father took her to Logopolis and that the Doctor was needed.  Soon enough the Doctor realizes that the Master is at work and everything that has happen has lead to the universe coming apart by the seams.  Can the Doctor save the universe, stop the Master and survive?  This you have to watch to see.The last installment entitled ""Castrovalva"" the Doctor has regenrated.

The Master returned, he forced the regeneration of the Fourth Doctor, and we saw the start of the Fifth Doctor.I have always enjoyed these particular stories because they are interconnected.  So it seems appropriate to put these stories out as a single box set.One thing I'd like to mention is that Matthew Waterhouse, who plays Adric, and has been hopelessly criticized over the years by Who fandom, actually comes across pretty good in these stories.  He seems to play a vital role in resolving (or creating) the crisis at hand.  He is occasionally over the top but after watching these again, I had a new found respect for him.But I very much enjoy the extras.  Tom Baker talks openly about his final days on the show and the mixed feelings he had about leaving it as well as the difficulties he often put his co-stars and production team through with his attitude.After a while the contemporary Davison interviews from shows such as ""Pebble Mill at One,"" ""Swap Shop,"" ""Blue Peter,"" and ""Nationwide"" became a tad redundant.

1057657,A37UPPF989N4EB,B000NJXG8G,"JKO ""A Doctor Who Viewer""","[15, 15]","Three stories from a very turbulent era of the classic BBC series Doctor Who have hit the shelves, either in a box set or as three individual discs - a much more expensive option! Grouped together under the title ""New Beginnings"" or alternatively ""The Return of The Master"", these three stories very much make up the `end of an era' and a fresh start for the errant Time Lord.Tom Baker had been playing the part of the Doctor since 1974 and although it was by now very accepted for different actors to play the part, he had become so entrenched in the role that the public very much saw him as ""The"" Doctor and for a whole generation of younger viewers, he was the ""Only"" Doctor. Behind the scenes, Baker had become more and more difficult to work with and changes in the production team at the start of season 18 had irritated him even further. His annual threat to leave the show was presented in due course and this time - it was accepted! New producer John Nathan-Turner was eager to stamp his own identity on the show and recasting the central role was one that certainly excited him. Although he briefly considered Richard Griffiths for the part, his one and only choice was the much younger actor Peter Davison, who was already very well known to TV viewers from his work on All Creatures Great and Small.By the time The Keeper of Traken, the penultimate story of season 18, was in production, Baker's departure had been announced and plans were well under way to ease the transition to the new Doctor, to be played by 29-years-old Peter Davison, the youngest actor yet to take on the part. In order to make the change over smooth and take the opportunity to halt the declining ratings and re-launch the almost eighteen-years-old show, Nathan-Turner made many sweeping changes to the look of the programme as well as many cast changes in addition to the role of the Doctor. At the start of the season, new music, opening titles, costuming and design elements had given the show a very much needed lift although in retrospect, they may not all have been particularly successful. Despite the departing lead actor, he also made many other cast changes, including dropping the Doctor's companion Romana (played by Baker's wife Lalla Ward) and his robot dog K9. Three new companions were introduced throughout the season, with Adric, a teenage boy played by Matthew Waterhouse arriving in story three and Nyssa, a teenage girl played by Sarah Sutton, appearing first in The Keeper of Traken. Tegan Jovanka, an Australian air hostess played by Janet Fielding came on board in the last story of the season, the middle segment of this set, Logopolis, the last of Baker's tenure. As if all these changes weren't enough, The Master, the Doctor's fellow Time Lord and bitterest enemy, was resurrected after a few years out of the show, played by both Geoffrey Beevers and Anthony Ainley. Finally, with another needed revamp of the graphics and a move to a new day and time slot, plus the scheduling two episodes per week, Peter Davison takes on the role in the third of the set, Castrovalva. So many changes...The three stories themselves stand up quite well, although all are rather indicative of the Nathan-Turner approach to the show - hugely complicated story lines that often don't make much sense before repeated viewing. Perhaps script editor Christopher H. Bidmead, who also penned the scripts for both Logopolis and Castrovalva, is more at fault here, but scripting and story telling is often cited as the key weakness in Nathan-Turner's ability. Indeed, the wonderful extras included on these three discs feature many interviews with the cast and writers, most notably Tom Baker and Peter Davison, who are nearly all somewhat critical of Nathan-Turner and his approach to the show. Costuming seems to be something that irritates both the lead actors, but the ever changing cast list and the expansion of the companions is something that clearly neither was happy with, as the writers and Directors involved echo. The ""in-jokes"" that were beginning to pepper the scripts is also clearly an irritant to all but the producer.The disc's extras are really phenomenal and even if these stories aren't your favorite, the extras will make it all worthwhile. Apart from many, many new and extremely frank interviews, there are all sorts of news and archive shows to enjoy, including many features on Davison's winning of the role. Each disc has its own commentary, The Keeper of Traken featuring the late Anthony Ainley, who thus marks his one and only commentary contribution. For me, Ainley is one of the problems that overshadows these three stories. He starts off in the role of Tremas; a character that is taken over by The Master at the end of the Traken adventure, going on to appear as The Master in the next two stories and throughout the subsequent nine years of the original show. A hammier actor is unimaginable. His pantomime-like performance did a lot to destroy the integrity of the character. Geoffrey Beevers, who plays The Master in the majority of the Traken story would have made a much, much more sinister and believable character and it's such a shame he wasn't offered (or at least didn't accept) the role full time. One extremely annoying feature of the Traken commentary is that Ainley and Matthew Waterhouse keep repeating lines from the show, which actually makes it sound like there's a time delay echo on the disc. It takes some getting used to. Sarah Sutton and writer Johnny Byrne add their thoughts to the Traken commentary. Tom Baker and Janet Fielding (together with Christopher H. Bidmead) provide the Logopolis commentary and alas, Baker is almost silent throughout the recording. He contributes very little indeed. Peter Davison joins Fielding and director Fiona Cumming for Castrovalva.The new dawn for the show really did arrive with Davison. Although I'm no fan of his portrayal of The Doctor, the revamp came at the right time and salvaged an otherwise dying show, giving it a complete new lease of life. The move away from Saturday tea-time to a later weeknight slot proved a hit and the ratings improved dramatically. What Baker, Davison, Bidmead, director John Black and others in the accompanying documentaries have to say about the new (and passing) era of the show is fascinating. The honesty from Baker is extremely revealing and almost makes this set an invaluable addition to the Doctor Who library on its own.",5,A whole new beginning,1181606400,"06 12,

1057658,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000NJXG8G,Kevin J. Loria,"[8, 11]","For 3 story-arcs of classic Dr. Who, this is a really good price for a set, especially one including Logopolis and Castrovalva (both of which I've been tempted to by on VHS just to see them again). These are part of  the iconic Tom Baker's run as the 4th Doctor and the end of his final season in the role. K9 is gone, as is Romana. He wears his plum digs that suit  the somber mood of his last 2 stories: The Keeper Of Traken, Logopolis,  and Castrovalva.Disc ONE: The set opens with the Keeper of Traken which reintroduces the Master (absent since a showdown with the Doctor in Deadly Assassin). At the end of his 13th incarnation (12th regeneration) he stays in the shadows (so to speak) for much of the 1st half of this one, but by the end he is literally a new man.This one introduces Nyssa, eventually to become the new Zo, brainy-girl on board the TARDIS, while Adric, equally brainy but not really sensible is also on board for all 3 of these (when will they learn that the super-genius kid is an annoying archetype). The plot of this one is shaky but necessary for the reoccurring role the Master is to have in the 5th Doctors run.Disc TWO: Next is Logopolis. If Keeper of Traken is somber, then Logopolis is literally the wake before the funeral. The Doctor is more visable distressed over leaving Romana in E-space (still waiting for the DVD E-space 3 set). His plans to fix the long broken TARDIS chameleon circuit on Logopolis. Before doing so, he must find a real police call-box to measure, but in doing so inadvertently lands around the ""new Master's"" TARDIS, which ultimately leads to the death of the Doctor (well mortal wounding anyway). Loads of moody shots, in and out of the TARDIS, lots of quirky labyrinthine scenes with future companion Tegan lost onboard. The new Master is terrifically, theatrically hammy and plays nicely off Baker's manic energy (although substantially drained by his standards, in character the Doctor seems to have stoically accepted his impending death as Baker has stoically accepts his retirement.) He leaves at the top of his game here, a great, great story.Disc Three: Castrovalva introduces the 5th, and youngest Doctor (at the time I'm not sure about Tennant's age). Peter Davidson, brings the character away from the 4th Doctor's style and borrows heavily from the older Doctors ( in spite of his youth, he plays it more like the stogy old original incarnation played by William Hartnell.) When filming, the shooting order was altered so that, although this is the first of the new Doctor's episodes, it was shot after Four to Doomsday (story 2 of the season). So Davidson knew where his regeneration addled transformation would end up, because he had already filmed as the wholly recuperated Doctor. But the process is a hard one, Castrovalva opens immediately after the Doctor's regeneration, as his companions try to get him to safety, narrowly escaping the Master, or so it seems.While the Doctor struggles to retain/ regain his wits (see brilliant scenes with the Doctor struggling not to lose his way by unraveling the 4th Doctor's iconic scarf).The crew falls deeper into the Master's web of traps as the arrive on Castrovalva, appropriately named after the M.C. Escher work. A great start for the new Doctor.New Beginnings: Drinking GamesDrink whenever you hear the ""Cloister Bell"" (the ringing of which means emanate danger or drunkenness)Drink when the MASTER watches / rebukes the Doctor from the gloomy safety of his TARDIS console room.Drink whenever one actor or character replaces another via regeneration / body snatching / disguise or miscasting.Drink whenever someone misplaces the Doctor (including himself).Drink whenever anyone declares: ""But, the Doctor's in there!""Drink when any of the TARDIS crew complains.

It's obnoxious and offensive, I pay full price for a DVD to see the show, not those stupid trailors!  Also you cannot bypass the stupid blue limbo ""vortexcrapola"" front end intro TOO the menu directly.  That said, the DVD has restored the original quality of the shows.  Keeper of Traken was always my favorite, though I never thought of it as a finalizing of Tom Baker in some ""trilogy"" Logopolis is also good but ""Castrovalva"" is cheapened by comparison!  JOhn Nathen Turner odviously had a few laurels to rest upon after his bout with T-Baker, who odviously made the show in season 18.  As for all the extra DVD docs, Tom Baker's name is mentioned a lot in bitter and somewhat resentable coments by his fellow employers and actors alike.  THese were the new boats to the show and so he decided to leave.  Nathen Turner, a real youth nut wanted only young people and Barry Letts hired him to breath the life in to the otherwise ""dead"" show(season 17 wasn't that bad to me).  He did this quite well, but also was not exactly any more the ""angel"" as Tom Baker was.  In fact thier was quite a conflict between all the actors and no one person is to blame, Red Herrings only make one quite the business!  William Shatner is said to be similar in his overbaring way to Star Trek(Ironically).  But in the movies, despite his contiual ""boasting"" in the DVD docs there, it was mostly quite accurate!  Also most Paramont stuff would have stagnated anyway if not for these ""eccentric"" actors.

But in comes Peter Davison, who overcame my natural suspicion of any new incarnation with an incredibly sweet smile and a few well-placed puns. Hooray!Plot wise, the Keeper of Traken was probably my favorite story, gripping, interesting, and with a certain sense of sorrow for the ultra-hippy Traken natives who get menaced by a mysterious...er...menace. Logopolis introduced Tegan, who, sadly, is not the best companion in the world, and I found her so irritating that it was hard to concentrate on the story. But Four's end is gut-wrenching, and the advent of Five suitably dramatic. Castrovalva was alright, though rather a lot of it was taken up watching Nyssa and Tegan trek through a forest while wearing improbable clothing.

I really didn't want to see Tom Baker leave at this point. He was still at the top of his game and better than ever here. I think there were a few reasons why Tom left and if you know these reasons, you really can't blame him. First off, John Nathan-Turner. The guy solely responsible for ruining everything that was good about the series. Secondly, some of the new crew that kissed Turner's butt. Thirdly, the writing which was geared towards pleasing Turner's ideals. Tom Baker adored ""Doctor Who"" and really didn't want to leave but he knew what was occuring and didn't like the way his character was being compromised. Although, I enjoy these stories(especially ""Keeper Of Traken""), there is a lack of humor and witty lines coming from the Doctor during this final season. I can understand that in the ""logopolis"" story but not the others. I miss that and you know that Baker was being held back. Something which Philip Hinchcliffe(producer during the glory years)would have never done. Baker clearly no longer had creative control over his character and for this reason, the stories in this season aren't as entertaining as they could be. Also, there is the addition of too many companions and in doing so Baker(who really drove the show)gets less screen time and not as much to do. Like many ""Who"" fans, I really wish Tom Baker would have stayed on for another two or three seasons but I can totally understand why he chose to leave. He left at the peak of the series and it would never be as good as this again. Baker was incredibly smart(we already knew that of course) and made a wise decision. Can you imagine how he felt filming those last scenes though? It had to be unbearable for him. Tom Baker will always be the ""definitive"" doctor.

1057668,A238M34Z3X2IBD,B000NJXG8G,Thomas E. O'Sullivan,"[33, 36]","If you were a fan of DOCTOR WHO back in the 1980's and you lived in Maryland, then MPT was your home of DOCTOR WHO, and your daddy was Tom Baker... always.  For years (and years) MPT would air the entire seven season run of Baker from ROBOT to LOGOPOLIS right up until Peter Davidson sat up tied in Baker's famous scarf and then regenerate again tomorrow back in Tom Baker... and it would begin again.  For what seemed like forever DOCTOR WHO was just Tom Baker and it frustrated me to no end - leading me to believe that CASTROVALVA was a masterpeice of WHO fiction denied us.  But, one day MPT announced that not only had they purchased the Davidson run, but the entire run of DOCTOR WHO as well... and there I was, at the end of LOGOPOLIS, Davidson sitting up tied in Baker's famous scarf and the next day...it was William Hartnell, and it was miles to go until LOGOPOLIS came around again.Don't get me wrong.  Being able to view the DOCTOR WHO from the beginning was pure magic, but in the back of my mind, I was counting down until, finally, at long last... CASTROVALVA began... and once again, here I am and all it takes now is for me to hit PLAY for the show to begin.  Times have changed, as to my view of the final two stories of Tom Baker and the first for Peter Davidson, they've changed as well, but not by much.THE KEEPER OF TRAKEN is a studio bound story high in design and simple in drama.  The performances across the board are very good (with only Matthew Waterhouse not ready for prime time), and the story manages at once to be original, yet a copy as well.  It doesn't take much to see where all this is heading and while that may sink most shows, here it frees you from having to pay too close attention, and simply enjoy the atmosphere - and TRAKEN has that in spades.  From the casual, and comfortable, opening to the renewed battle between the Master and the Doctor, THE KEEPER OF TRAKEN is a solid peice of work.  So much so that the Doctor manages to disappear from the story for a long while before you really miss him.LOGOPOLIS is a stunning mess.  There's no two ways about it.  It's one of the most original ideas the series has had, and yet, it does almost nothing with it.  The story strays, having been burden with not only the weight of continuity issues, the reintroduction of Nyssa, the introduction of Tegan, the battle between the Master and the Doctor and finally, the end of Tom Baker's run on DOCTOR WHO.  For a story under constant pressure (I mean, it is the literally the end of the universe we're talking about), it all comes across like a walk in the park.  It's simply the silliest armageddon ever.CASTROVALVA follows on the heels of LOGOPOLIS, taking up the challange thrown down in the previous story in trying to make use of the idea that reality can simply be maintained, created and destroyed through math alone.  And it almost works.  What nearly kills the story is also one of its greatest strengths, and that's in the performances of the new TARDIS cast starting to work as a unit.  Davidson was lucky enough to not have had to make his debut story until he had already made FOUR TO DOOMSDAY which meant he had a better idea and handle on just how this new Doctor was going to be played.  It's breathing room he uses to great advantage here - but, it's given too much time, and what's left is not enough for the mystery behind Castrovalva.  Davidson is good, but Anthony Ainley is better.  The Master's final moments trapped inside Castrovalva are horrific and unsettling, leaving the last moments of the story with the Doctor in the saddle feeling a bit shallow.As usual 2 ENTERTAIN have gone out of there way to back up these stories with a host of excellent extras.  Commentaries across the board are well done and informative.  On THE KEEPER OF TRAKEN it's something of a shame that Ainley has so little to say on the topic of the Master and his time on DOCTOR WHO.  Someone dropped the ball here by not sitting Ainley down with a professional to mine those memories for future generations.  As it is, he's comfortable, happy and delighted to be back among friends. Also, I simply can not priase Janet Fielding enough - whenever she's on a commentary, the tracks shine.  She's pure brass, totally adult, and never afriad to speak her mind.  For some reason it's the women of DOCTOR WHO that always bring something to the table (and they seem to be the only ones that can make Tom Baker sit up, take notice and be honest) which makes these tracks worthwhile.  Text commentary is tight and informative, and worth your time.  The MAKING OF... and various documentaries across all three dics are very good (with some repeat from the commentary tracks, but, that's expected now).All in all, it's pretty much everything you could want spread over three DVD's.  Three different, but creative stories, two Doctor's, one Master and a gaggle of companions.  Now, I have CASTROVALVA, bring on ROBOT.",4,WHO'S YOUR DADDY?,1181347200,"06 9, 2007",2007,4947,"['were', 'fan', 'DOCTOR', 'WHO', 'back', '1980', 'lived', 'Maryland', 'then', 'MPT', 'was', 'home',
