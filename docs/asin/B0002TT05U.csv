844964,A4PTUEVFE13K6,B0002TT05U,Allen Chapman,"[34, 36]","First of all this is simply a GREAT CD! Dolly's live show is a show worth catching. For years one of my favorite Dolly concerts was her long deleted ""Dolly In London"" video from 1983. At long last we have another live recording that equals that show. This concert recorded during Dolly's ""Halos & Horns"" tour from 2002 show she hasn't lost a single thing. Dolly jokes between the songs and you can tell she is having a blast, as such the audience is too. Something some of the newer artists might want to learn.The set list for this show is somewhat interesting in that there aren't really a whole lot of hits. ""Coat Of Many Colors"", ""Applejack"", ""9 To 5, ""Jolene"" and ""I Will Always Love You"" are really her only ""hits"" included. There is an a capella medley of four other hits, but for the most part these are all newer songs from the Dolly canon. By the way, in the medley she and her singers do a sped up snippit of ""Two Doors Down"" that you have to hear to belive, it really does sound like she's on the wrong speed. She did this same thing years ago with ""Do I Ever Cross Your Mind"", so it's cool to hear her do it again on something new.Dolly today sounds just as fresh and vibrant as she did twenty or thirty years ago. Her jokes are corny but she knows that and has fun with it. If you're a Dolly fan you will love this album.",5,Dolly is still at the top of her game!,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,1335,"['First', 'simply', 'GREAT', 'CD', 'Dolly', 'live', 'show', 'show', 'worth', 'catching', 'years', 'one', 'favorite', 'Dolly', 'concerts', 'was', 'long', 'deleted', 'Dolly', 'London', 'video', '1983', 'long', 'last', 'have', 'live', 'recording', 'show', 'concert', 'recorded', 'Dolly', 'Halos', 'Horns', 'tour', '2002', 'show', ""n't"", 'lost', 'single', 'thing', 'Dolly', 'songs', 'can', 'tell', 'having', 'blast', 'such', 'audience', 'too', 'Something', 'newer', 'artists', 'might', 'want', 'learn.The', 'set', 'list', 'show', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'whole', 'lot', 'hits', 'Coat', 'Many', 'Colors', 'Applejack', '9', '5', 'Jolene', 'Will', 'Always', 'Love', 'are', 'really', 'only', 'hits', 'included', 'capella', 'medley', 'four', 'other', 'hits', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'newer', 'songs', 'Dolly', 'canon', 'way', 'medley', 'singers', 'do', 'sped', 'up', 'snippit', 'Two', 'Doors', 'Down', 'have', 'hear', 'belive', 'really', 'sound', 'wrong', 'speed', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'years', 'ago', 'Do', 'Ever', 'Cross', 'Mind', 'cool', 'hear', 'do', 'again', 'something', 'new.Dolly', 'today', 'just', 'fresh', 'vibrant', 'did', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'jokes', 'are', 'corny', 'fun', ""'re"", 'Dolly', 'fan', 'will', 'love', 'album']",N/A

Dolly Parton is one of my favorite performers, and having not seen her live in concert, this is definately the next best thing. The songs range from early hits like ""9 to 5"" and ""Jolene"", to newer classics like ""Marry Me"", ""Dagger Through The Heart"" and ""I'm Gone"". She does an emotional reading of her hit ""I Will Always Love You"", which in my opinion is way more meaningful and well done than Whitney Houston's version. It's great to hear her put her stamp on others classics like ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""After The Goldrush"", ""If"". She also spends a lot of time talking and joking with the crowd.

It is real value for money, it is a must for any fan of music. The up side is Dolly Parton's 200% performance along with her band, you get quantity, quality and personality, along with excellent singing and playing. The downside is the rather subdued crowd, even if they enjoyed it, they were a more grey suited audience.",5,Brilliant,1357257600,"01 4, 2013",2013,415,"['Just', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'better', 'like', 'Dolly', 'Parton', 'not', 'will', 'like', 'real', 'value', 'money', 'must', 'fan', 'music', 'up', 'side', 'Dolly', 'Parton', '200', '%', 'performance', 'band', 'get', 'quantity', 'quality', 'personality', 'excellent', 'singing', 'playing', 'downside', 'rather', 'subdued', 'crowd', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'were', 'more', 'grey', 'suited', 'audience']",N/A
