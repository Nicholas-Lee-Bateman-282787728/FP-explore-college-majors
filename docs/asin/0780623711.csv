The plot is a weak rehashing of every buddy cop film ever made.  Even in Jackie's Hong Kong films where the plots make very little sense there is some originality involved.  Chris Tucker (annoyingly) plays the loose cannon cop, no one can control.  This is a character we've seen in thousands of films and he's such a one trick pony he doesn't add anything new or fresh.  As for Jackie he looks like the Asian William Shatner, all slicked back pompador and puffy.  He has William Shatner's moves too.  The stunts are an incredible let down and the fight scenes are anemic.  The fight with Jackie and Tucker hand-cuffed together was done much better in Project A II.  Just like the first time Jackie came to America in the early eighties (in the horrible &quot;The Protector&quot;) the director doesn't use Jackie's acrobatic skills or martial arts effectively.

Griffith, John Ford and Frank Capra, in which foreigners and outsiders to the dominant white culture are absorbed into that shimmering ideal: America.  Unlike its famous precursors, though, who demanded that the Other suppressed his ethnicity and became symbolically white, 'Rush Hour''s new America respects cultural differences and individuality.  Each culture has something to learn and give to the other, which is different from the usual Imperialism plundering ancient traditions.  It even insists on Mandarin subtitles in the Hong Kong sequences rather than the comedy accents Hollywood usually employ.  And what is particularly winning about 'Rush Hour' is that these 'serious' themes are integrated with the lightest of touches: where Capra would have hectored his audience with platidunous speeches, 'Rush Hour' offers delightful verbal riffs, hilarious musical interludes, and, that old stomping ground of clashing cultures, food.More important than the thematic stuff is that 'Rush Hour' is a very rare thing in contemporary Hollywood: a fast and funny comedy thriller.  The partnership between loud-mouthed, slightly bent Chris Tucker, and humorous but disciplined Jackie Chan is sheer pleasure, at once relaxed and intense.  The dialogue has more than its fair share of classic wisecracks.  But best of all, in this age of hamfisted advertising graduates and jaded hacks, is that Brett Ratner knows how to direct and pace an action movie, helped immeasurably by the maestro of slick soundtracks, Lalo Schifrin.  Chan may be moving down a gear for his American audience, but his body's flexibility is a wonder.  Pauline Kael once compared Bruce Lee to Fred Astaire: Chan must be Gene Kelly, his inventive use of props for dazzling choreographic effect (see in particular the climactic business with a millenia-ancient vase) is at once physical, weightless and always witty.

Chris Tucker played a Los Angeles cop and Jackie Chan was a Hong Kong cop who were somehow forced together, with the idea of getting rid of both of them, on a case involving the kidnapping of a diplomat's daughter in Los Angeles. It'd complicated, but makes good sense if you are viewing the movie. Well, neither one of them likes the forced pairing. It's fun to watch them try to get away from one another early in the movie to becoming a very effective team at the end.There's action, action, action in this movie and it pays to keep a sharp eye in that some of the stunts can go by so fast as to be almost invisible if you aren't glued to the visual scene. In particular, the fighting is just incredible. You'll end up muttering ""How did they do that?"" over and over during the movie. A lot of the stunts are not only amazing physical feats, they're funny. It's an amusing movie and Chan and Tucker play well off of one another. The story is somewhat frivolous, but I don't think you'd be watching a movie like this for any kind of a deep story. It's a high-action movie with really incredible and amusing stunts.

(I prefer Owen Wilson in Shanghai Noon, his humour is more my style).  Jackie also seems very toned down, showing little of what makes him great in Asia.  After seeing his Hong Kong films (especially his Police Story and Project A series and lately Accidental Spy) this movie does not compare.  (And they STILL didn't let him sing!  And I hated his hair style!)  After reading Jackie's book &quot;My Life in Action&quot; I understand why the movie wasn't quite as good as I was expecting (action-wise).  He had very little control of the action and stunts.  This is usually what makes Jackie's films so &quot;special&quot;, though as he is getting older it makes sense that he does not take so many risks.

Jackie Chan's Hollywood career got a second break with Rush Hour and the plot has more substance than most Jackie Chan movies.We got James Carter, played by Chris Tucker, who is an LAPD detective with a penchant for dancing Michael Jackson-style while blowing up blocks of buildings. This gets him into trouble with his sergeant who, at the request of the FBI, assigns him to a case where he ends up being a nurse maid to Lee (Chan), a Chinese detective who has just broken up a huge smuggling ring in Hong Kong. The FBI want Carter and Lee to not interfere with the investigation of the kidnapping of the Chinese Consul's daughter, but Lee and Carter do anyway, in their own charismatic manner and triumph where the FBI fail.The martial arts expertise of Jackie Chan is fantastic and shows that his truly a master in what he does. Chris Tucker does a terrific job of playing the off the wall LAPD officer who trys to keep Chan's character out of the way of an investigation. Chris Tucker is an extremely well disciplined actor, and seems to go very smoothly with the styles of Jackie Chan. Not only is the action part of the movie good, the now common jokes in martial arts movies are all there, including many racial/cultural difference jokes not necessarily making fun of races, but the cultural differences.

In the sequels, Chris Tucker is given top billing and Chan plays the co-star during action scenes. Rush Hour made its $33 million dollar budget back in one weekend. The music by Lalo Schifrin is very good. Inspector Lee(Chan) and Detective Carter(Tucker) search for a Chinese girl kidnapped by extortionists. Rush Hour has cop movie cliches and sardonic humor. Brett Ratner did a decent job directing the film. There's rap, disco and classic R&B; songs in the film. After Rush Hour, movie producers were willing to listen to some of Chan's ideas. He wanted to make a romantic-action film called ""Nosebleed"" that took place in the World Trade Center. After 9/11, those plans fell through. The Spy Next Door(2010) may have used those ideas, but I've never seen that movie.Steve Wong's Drive(1995) may have given Rush Hour its formula for an action comedy. Although, Drive is a lot more violent and foul mouthed than Rush Hour. Rush Hour was intentionally made as a PG-13 movie. Ken Leung is quite good as a bad guy in the film. Leung actually says ""rush hour"" in one scene. Elizabeth Pena is quite good as a bomb squad officer. The late Chris Penn played an arms merchant. Rex Linn and Mark Rolston are quite good as FBI agents. Rush Hour was made around the same time when the British gave Hong Kong back to China.

I've seen him in other movies and I think he's funny. Other critics won't agree with me, but I think the guy is hilarious. In this film, the two play Carter (Tucker) and Lee (Chan), two cops on the search for a young girl named Sooyung (or something) who has been kidnapped and held for a ransom.

A friend of his is dispatched to Los Angeles in a consulate position, and Chan is summoned soon thereafter when his buddy's daughter is kidnapped by gangsters. The FBI, not wanting any interference in the case, arranges to pair him with one of the wildest cops in LA history. As played by Chris Tucker, he is also the loudest. This ploy to get Chan away from the investigation doesn't work, of course. As always, the FBI agents are made to look like they are sharing a brain. You've already guess that the two policemen get along at first like cats and dogs, but by the end of the picture, they are best buddies. Along the way, they solve the case.As a comedy team, Chan and Tucker work well together. The quiet, low-keyed Chan plays straight man to the brash, outrageous Tucker. There are the usual ongoing jokes about cultural differences, but at least in this case, pairing a Chinese character with an Afro-American does create a lot of opportunity for humor. Opposing tastes in food is a good topic, as is the language barrier. There is also a running joke about our obsession with hand guns. Jackie Chan is hard not to like, while Chris Tucker has much in common with W. C. Fields, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey. People either love him or hate him.As is the rule in action comedy, the plot makes no sense. What carries the movie is the teaming of two actors whose personalities work well together. The special effects don't hurt either. There's an explosion every three minutes.Lalo Schifin delivers a fine musical score. The set design is appropriately garish. A special thanks goes to Rush Hour's editors, who made sure it was short and to the point.While Rush Hour is often entertaining, it does not measure up to a couple of similarly themed comedies - 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop - that were big hits when I was younger.

I think that this was a major challenge for stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. And more importantly, I think that &quot;Rush Hour&quot; was Chris Tucker's breakthrough film since he first appeared in &quot;Friday&quot;. &quot;Rush Hour&quot; calls the attention to Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee, a detective from Hong Kong who travels to L.A. after he finds out that the daughter of a Chinese diplomat has been kidnapped and being held for ransom. But, the FBI has dispatched a local L.A. detective, James Carter (Tucker) to keep Chan's character out of the way of things. And, of course, Tucker's character has the absolute biggest mouth in L.A. I mean, Tucker is sort of a rebel in this film, no one can calm him down! Lee and Carter can't stand each other. Much less, even like each other. But they are assigned by the FBI to go out and find the missing girl and save her life...if both Lee and Carter doesn't kill each other first! &quot;Rush Hour&quot; has everything that you'd expect from a Jackie Chan film...unbelievable stunt work, action, you name it! And it has everything that you'd expect from a Chris Tucker film...laughs, laughs, and more laughs! This is the greatest buddy-buddy cop film ever made since the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series.

This film will keep you laughing from start to finish. Chris Tucker is too funny for words and Jackie Chan still has the quickest hands of any martial artist I have ever seen-other than the great Bruce Lee. It is a great story of how two cops from two different worlds and with two completely different personalities join up under the premise of steering clear of an FBI investigation involving the kidnapping of a Chinese dignitary's daughter. Of course, Detective Carter (Tucker) eventually fails in his attempt to keep Inspector Lee (Chan) out of the investigation. The two, however, ultimately bond and join forces to crack the kidnapping case without the help of the FBI. Rush Hour is full of explosive action and comic wit.
