1010974,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000H7JCFA,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I love the way the episodes come off like a cheesy 80's comedy only to provide a surprising amount of disgusting and somewhat offensive humor.  That's what makes That's My Bush so great.  The theme song is something *very* close to a show like Alf or Night Court, or some other 80's show.  But when the show actually begins, and the storyline and characters arrive, you quickly realize this is certainly not a rip-off of some cheesy 80's show.The actors that are supposed to look like George Bush and Laura are pretty decent, though not the best lookalikes I have seen.  The guy who imitates George Bush occasionally on the Jay Leno show would have fit the part better, in my opinion.  Still, this Bush is a pretty good pick.I think the best thing about That's My Bush is how there's actually stories surrounding all the characters, and it's not just your typical ""Bush is dumb"" jokes (which is the kind of humor most people are known for when it comes to insulting President Bush).  Don't get me wrong, Bush is portrayed as a dummy more often than not, but it's NOT the only thing the storylines focus on.I love the Dick Cheney and Barbara Bush characters.  Dick acts just like his first name, and Barbara is a super ""b-word"" when it comes to trying to accept Laura as George's wife.  It makes you wonder if Barbara and Laura really DO get along in real life.  George Bush's character can be dumb sometimes, but not ALL the time.The writers do a great job mixing in other characters so not all the attention centers around Bush.  There's also a cheesy laugh track in between all the jokes to again make the show feel like we've warped back to the 80's.A great, catchy theme song with jazzy instruments suits a very good, overlooked, and short-lived comedy show.",5,great comedy,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1762,"['love', 'way', 'episodes', 'come', 'cheesy', '80', 'comedy', 'only', 'provide', 'surprising', 'amount', 'disgusting', 'somewhat', 'offensive', 'humor', 'what', 'My', 'Bush', 'so', 'great', 'theme', 'song', 'something', '*very*', 'close', 'show', 'Alf', 'Night', 'Court', 'other', '80', 'show', 'when', 'show', 'actually', 'storyline', 'characters', 'arrive', 'quickly', 'realize', 'certainly', 'not', 'rip-off', 'cheesy', '80', 'show.The', 'actors', 'are', 'supposed', 'look', 'George', 'Bush', 'Laura', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'not', 'best', 'lookalikes', 'have', 'seen', 'guy', 'who', 'George', 'Bush', 'occasionally', 'Jay', 'Leno', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'fit', 'part', 'better', 'opinion', 'Still', 'Bush', 'pretty', 'good', 'pick.I', 'think', 'best', 'thing', 'My', 'Bush', 'how', 'actually', 'stories', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'not', 'just', 'typical', 'Bush', 'dumb', 'jokes', 'kind', 'humor', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'known', 'when', 'insulting', 'President', 'Bush', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Bush', 'portrayed', 'dummy', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'NOT', 'only', 'thing', 'storylines', 'focus', 'on.I', 'love', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'Barbara', 'Bush', 'characters', 'Dick', 'just', 'first', 'name', 'Barbara', 'super', 'b-word', 'when', 'trying', 'accept', 'Laura', 'George', 'wife', 'wonder', 'Barbara', 'Laura', 'really', 'DO', 'get', 'along', 'real', 'life', 'George', 'Bush', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'dumb', 'sometimes', 'not', 'time.The', 'writers', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'mixing', 'other', 'characters', 'not', 'attention', 'centers', 'Bush', 'also', 'cheesy', 'laugh', 'track', 'jokes', 'again', 'make', 'show', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'warped', 'back', ""80's.A"", 'great', 'catchy', 'theme', 'song', 'jazzy', 'instruments', 'suits', 'very', 'good', 'overlooked', 'short-lived', 'comedy', 'show']",That's My Bush!

Bush, Laura Bush and Karl Rove, ""That's My Bush"" is not remotely about the real Bush administration.Rather, the show is a parody of formulaic television. The premise is a standard family situation comedy about an ordinary doofus whose job just happens to be President of the United States. Tour groups walk through the living room during family fights. An obnoxious neighbor walks right in whenever he likes. The laugh track is one of the most important elements of the show, over-reacting to deliberately lame jokes and supplying dirty hoots whenever the president's dumb blonde secretary walks into a room. There's a tagline (clearly inspired by The Honeymooners) repeated at the end of every episode, with the ""audience"" joining in: ""One of these days, I'm gonna punch you right in the face.""Each episode combines a serious topic with a timeworn TV situation: drug control and trouble with the mother-in-law, or missile defense and an illegal cable-TV hookup. Don't expect any light to be shed on the serious topics. It's all played for laughs.If you're easily offended, save your money. There aren't many subjects Matt Stone and Trey Parker consider off-limits. The show isn't as scatological as South Park, but if you're prone to offense-taking, Stone and Parker are out to get you, and they're almost certainly going to succeed. If you can take it, there is some hilarious stuff here.It's good there were only 8 episodes -- many more would have run the risk of turning it into one more goofy situation comedy.Each episode includes an audio commentary track with Stone and Parker, and another commentary track with the entire regular cast. But, if you buy DVDs primarily for the ""extras,"" save your money. Each commentary lasts only a few minutes at the beginning of the episode. There are no other extras.If, in spite of all these warnings to save your money, you buy this anyway -- well, I think you'll enjoy it.

That's sad, too, because this show was unique in its own right and it made Bush seem (this is hard to type) likeable. Much like Norm walking through the doors of Cheers, Bush walking through the doors of The White House had that type of impact. There were the other characters that we needed, too: there was the Dr. of Death himself (Jack K.), their neighbor that always told a bad joke and always did something that got George in trouble (like stealing cable or filling his hollow head with painful question marks), Laura, Karl R., their housekeeper, and the eyecandy named Princess. It had a sitcom format, made people laugh, but had a political undertone that didn't overwhelm or preach but did pull a South Park on the viewer.The issues were complex: Star Wars works and Bush accidentally hits the button. George talks to Ms. Cleo and she says he is in danger - so he bans the NRA and gets a visit from Moses. Pro-life/Pro-Choice - the horror of an abortion that lived versus a woman who says her body is her own. George and Laura's cat is ancient and they decide it is suffering, so they call in Dr. Death to help their cat go out in style.There are only eight of these episodes and the plotlines are a little more complex than this, but the eight are a must see for anyone that wants a good laugh and doesn't want to be preached to in their political satire. In addition, there are a lot of extras on the disk that are funny and rewarding, making this buy a great buy for fans of Parker and Stone and for those who do not like them as well.It is something different - this isn't one of their movies, is not South Park, and is even good to go back to when the day is young and you want to remember something better from 2001.",5,"One of these days, Laura, I'm gonna punch you in the face!",1216771200,"07 23, 2008",2008,1872,"['Trey', 'Parker', 'Matt', 'Stone', 'had', 'gem', 'when', 'show', 'was', 'play', 'then', '9/11', 'came', 'rearranged', 'way', 'were', 'allowed', 'see', 'world', 'sad', 'too', 'show', 'was', 'unique', 'own', 'right', 'made', 'Bush', 'seem', 'hard', 'type', 'likeable', 'Much', 'Norm', 'walking', 'doors', 'Cheers', 'Bush', 'walking', 'doors', 'White', 'House', 'had', 'type', 'impact', 'were', 'other', 'characters', 'needed', 'too', 'was', 'Dr.', 'Death', 'Jack', 'K.', 'neighbor', 'always', 'told', 'bad', 'joke', 'always', 'did', 'something', 'got', 'George', 'trouble', 'stealing', 'cable', 'filling', 'hollow', 'head', 'painful', 'question', 'marks', 'Laura', 'Karl', 'R.', 'housekeeper', 'eyecandy', 'named', 'Princess', 'had', 'sitcom', 'format', 'made', 'people', 'had', 'political', 'undertone', 'did', ""n't"", 'overwhelm', 'preach', 'did', 'pull', 'South', 'Park', 'viewer.The', 'issues', 'were', 'complex', 'Star', 'Wars', 'works', 'Bush', 'accidentally', 'button', 'George', 'talks', 'Ms.', 'Cleo', 'danger', 'so', 'NRA', 'visit', 'Moses', 'Pro-life/Pro-Choice', 'horror', 'abortion', 'lived', 'woman', 'who', 'body', 'own', 'George', 'Laura', 'cat', 'ancient', 'decide', 'suffering', 'call', 'Dr.', 'Death', 'help', 'cat', 'go', 'out', 'style.There', 'are', 'only', 'eight', 'episodes', 'plotlines', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'complex', 'eight', 'are', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'good', 'laugh', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'preached', 'political', 'satire', 'addition', 'are', 'lot', 'extras', 'disk', 'are', 'funny', 'rewarding', 'making', 'buy', 'great', 'buy', 'fans', 'Parker', 'Stone', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'like', 'well.It', 'something', 'different', ""n't"", 'one', 'movies', 'not', 'South', 'Park', 'even', 'good', 'go', 'back', 'when', 'day', 'young', 'want', 'remember', 'something', 'better', '2001']",That's My Bush!

Bush bands all guns and gets an attack bear to protect himself from a death omen from a fortune teller. With a gun-crazed Carliton Heston thrown into the mix, the show was an instant classic. The show had potential before 9-11. Hopefully, Comedy Central will breath new life into this series.",5,Bears and Bush!,1160870400,"10 15, 2006",2006,359,"['One', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'short', 'series', 'when', 'Prez', 'Bush', 'guns', 'attack', 'bear', 'protect', 'death', 'omen', 'fortune', 'teller', 'gun-crazed', 'Carliton', 'Heston', 'mix', 'show', 'was', 'instant', 'classic', 'show', 'had', 'potential', '9-11', 'Hopefully', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'will', 'breath', 'new', 'life', 'series']",That's My Bush!
