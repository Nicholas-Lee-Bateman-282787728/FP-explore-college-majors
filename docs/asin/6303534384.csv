I give this tape four stars because of the workout. I took a star off for the instructor. I have tried and tried to be objective and open minded to Bryan's style. But try as I might, I just don't like it. He is very annnoying to me and if I were in a class where the instructor started rubbing his hand on my thigh, I'd probably clock him! That being said, as long as I don't look at the tv, and just really concentrate on getting into the poses, I have a good time with this tape. It will challenge you, and stretch you. Great workout, poor instructor.",4,"A great workout, but.......",980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,660,"['really', 'great', 'workout', 'legs', 'get', 'shaking', 'everytime', ""'m"", 'nowhere', 'mastering', 'poses', 'give', 'tape', 'four', 'stars', 'workout', 'took', 'star', 'instructor', 'have', 'tried', 'tried', 'be', 'objective', 'open', 'minded', 'Bryan', 'style', 'try', 'might', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'very', 'annnoying', 'were', 'class', 'where', 'instructor', 'started', 'rubbing', 'hand', 'thigh', ""'d"", 'probably', 'clock', 'being', 'said', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'tv', 'just', 'really', 'concentrate', 'getting', 'poses', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'tape', 'will', 'challenge', 'stretch', 'Great', 'workout', 'poor', 'instructor']","Bryan Kest - Power Yoga, Vol. 2 - Tone VHS"

It was unbelievable!I've been doing yoga for about 4 years and did years of weightlifting before that so I was definitely not new to exercise. I can honestly say this was the single most challenging routine I've ever done.I followed Kest's advice throughout the tape and rested or modified as I needed to and by the end of the tape my heart was pumping, my mat was covered in sweat and I was forever grateful to have made it to &quot;relaxation pose&quot; (which I stayed in for quite some time I might add). I can see that this is a tape that will remain challenging for some time (if not indefinitely).I wanted to make a comment regarding those reviews that criticized this video because of the style of the production, or the appearence of the instructor and students as being too california or slick etc..... Anyone who actually DID this tape wouldn't have been even aware of that stuff because they'd be too busy DOING this tape. I had the same reaction to the MacGraw/Schiffman tape when I first got it, I thought it was too Hollywood and slick, that the music was too intrusive, but then I figured that before I criticized it I ought to really DO the routine and now it is one of my favorite tapes to work with.Regarding Bryan Kest himself, I found him to be very sincere and appreciate that he constantly stresses that it's not how the pose looks that's important but the sensation of the pose and the breath. This makes it possible to start working with these tapes even before you can achieve the postures (even if you never get them to &quot;look&quot; perfect). He really inspires you to want to push and challenge yourself within reasonable limits but without crossing that line where you might get an injury.I have many many yoga tapes (including David Swenson's which are fabulous, several with Rodney Yee as well as Patricia Walden's, Kripalu (Lundeen/Cope), as mentioned the MacGraw/Schiffman's and others) and this is up there at the top of the list with the best of them.I am really grateful to have bought the three set collection of Kest's and am looking forward to trying the 3rd tape as well (which I'm sure I'll be having to modify and rest thru in sections as well).Kest is fantastic! I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who is interested in Power Yoga!",5,This Routine Kicked My Butt!

For me, there is no other video that so completely strengthens, stretches and releases the power of the lower body.  Even after doing this tape and others regularly for several years, I still enjoy the chance this tape provides to dig deep into the legs and release the power present in our bodies.  Also, while this tape is a well-balanced workout, it does not hit the upper body as hard a some tapes (most tapes seem to hit the upper body harder than the legs) so it is a key change of pace and counterpoint to tapes hitting the upper body hard.  If you relax, sink into these poses and breathe deeply, you will feel a great strength and energy the whole day!",5,The Best of A Great Series -- Power From the Ground Up,1065830400,"10 11, 2003",2003,748,"['probably', 'best', 'power', 'yoga', 'video', 'market', 'even', 'years', 'other', 'video', 'so', 'completely', 'strengthens', 'stretches', 'power', 'lower', 'body', 'Even', 'doing', 'tape', 'others', 'regularly', 'several', 'years', 'still', 'enjoy', 'chance', 'tape', 'dig', 'deep', 'legs', 'release', 'power', 'present', 'bodies', 'Also', 'tape', 'well-balanced', 'workout', 'not', 'hit', 'upper', 'body', 'hard', 'tapes', 'most', 'tapes', 'seem', 'hit', 'upper', 'body', 'harder', 'legs', 'key', 'change', 'pace', 'counterpoint', 'tapes', 'hitting', 'upper', 'body', 'hard', 'relax', 'sink', 'poses', 'breathe', 'deeply', 'will', 'feel', 'great', 'strength', 'energy', 'whole', 'day']","Bryan Kest - Power Yoga, Vol. 2 - Tone VHS"

So I am discarding my Beginner's tapes and looking into some stronger stuff. I checked out the instructors and wanted to try Kest. This was his first video I bought. I now own three with one on the way!This is a really challenging workout. It is not a beginner's workout, however. In addition, he doesn't give the names of the asanas --- I wish he would. He did in the first tape in this series so I guess it's best if you get it and do it first. I would prefer an instructor to say to take Crow than to say put your hand here around . . . etc. Or worse, to just have the class do it.Having said that, it was not that hard to follow and I love Bryan. He is so totally cool and inspiring, such a wonderful instructor. I do think that he and Baron Baptiste both are a bit too touchy-feelie with some of the students --- a bit inappropriate.But all that aside, after the workout I knew I had worked every muscle. I was sore for two days! But I felt great mentally and physically.So for anyone who has a bit of Power Yoga under their belt and who wants to progress to a more advanced and probably longer class, I highly recommend this video and this instructor. I was more challenged and felt more muscle soreness doing this video than Baron Baptistes new one.",5,Excellent!
