985633,A3MNJL4ROH6LRW,B000F8OIAK,Don R. Holloway,"[0, 0]","This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I never get tired of watching it. I felt like the movie had some positive teaching points concerning father-son relationships, and about having fun with a friend, as the two boys, Brent and Jerry, were doing at the camp. It also taught about not fighting unless it's the only way. Having said that, I also enjoyed other things about the film besides just the moral lessons. I loved the look and feel of the great outdoors in the Arizona desert. There was just something liberating and energizing about the whole setting. Watching this movie just somehow gives me a feeling of being free. (I do realize, however, that this is not a film that will appeal to everyone.) I thought the actors did a fine job, for the most part. I really liked Lorenzo Henrie, the boy who played Jerry. He was so adorable. And Gemini Barnett, who played Brent, also seemed like a sweet kid. Lee Majors did great as a firm authority figure to keep watch over the camp and keep things in order. I liked the scene where Brent talks to Jerry's dad and tells him that he is being too hard on Jerry. I was happy to see Jerry and his dad getting along so well in the end. There's a lot of sweetness about this movie, yet is avoids being too mushy. It's just a nice little film that the family can watch together and there's something in it that everyone can cheer about. So find this movie and watch it. Just don't expect to see an Oscar-worthy performance, just expect a fresh breath of fun and friendship.",5,A Fresh Breath of Fun and Friendship,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,1521,"['one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'felt', 'movie', 'had', 'positive', 'teaching', 'points', 'concerning', 'father-son', 'relationships', 'having', 'fun', 'friend', 'two', 'boys', 'Brent', 'Jerry', 'were', 'doing', 'camp', 'also', 'taught', 'not', 'fighting', 'only', 'way', 'Having', 'said', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'other', 'things', 'film', 'just', 'moral', 'lessons', 'loved', 'look', 'feel', 'great', 'outdoors', 'Arizona', 'desert', 'was', 'just', 'something', 'liberating', 'energizing', 'whole', 'setting', 'Watching', 'movie', 'just', 'somehow', 'feeling', 'being', 'free', 'do', 'realize', 'however', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'thought', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'most', 'part', 'really', 'liked', 'Lorenzo', 'Henrie', 'boy', 'who', 'played', 'Jerry', 'was', 'so', 'adorable', 'Gemini', 'Barnett', 'who', 'played', 'Brent', 'also', 'seemed', 'sweet', 'kid', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'did', 'great', 'firm', 'authority', 'figure', 'keep', 'watch', 'camp', 'keep', 'things', 'order', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Brent', 'talks', 'Jerry', 'dad', 'being', 'too', 'hard', 'Jerry', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'Jerry', 'dad', 'getting', 'along', 'so', 'well', 'end', 'lot', 'sweetness', 'movie', 'avoids', 'being', 'too', 'mushy', 'just', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'together', 'something', 'everyone', 'can', 'cheer', 'about', 'So', 'find', 'movie', 'watch', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'just', 'expect', 'fresh', 'breath', 'fun', 'friendship']",N/A

985635,A98L9TI92ANCY,B000F8OIAK,Viagnette,"[0, 0]","A high rating is given for Arizona Summer only because it featured Lee Majors.  Story-wise, it smacks a little of that Hayley Mills classic ""The Parent Trap"".  However, the comparison stops there.  There are some fine Arizona scenery and good old camping antics.  The kids seem like a fresh breath in a weary campsite.  Here, the Lee Majors character, represents the tired Arizona outback, an old timer who still packs a punch (ponch) and no shortage on wits and guile even when his knee is not in the best condition.  The sublimal part of the story is spiritual, religious and moralistic, like ""Seven Heaven"".  Good family entertainment for couch potatoes without an agenda. As a person who loves camping out, this is good inspiration for my next camping trip.  Camping is a good place for family bonding.",4,Arizona Summer,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,806,"['high', 'rating', 'given', 'Arizona', 'Summer', 'only', 'featured', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'Story-wise', 'little', 'Hayley', 'Mills', 'classic', 'Parent', 'Trap', 'However', 'comparison', 'there', 'are', 'fine', 'Arizona', 'scenery', 'good', 'old', 'camping', 'antics', 'kids', 'seem', 'fresh', 'breath', 'weary', 'campsite', 'Here', 'Lee', 'Majors', 'character', 'tired', 'Arizona', 'outback', 'old', 'timer', 'who', 'still', 'punch', 'ponch', 'shortage', 'wits', 'guile', 'even', 'when', 'knee', 'not', 'best', 'condition', 'sublimal', 'part', 'story', 'spiritual', 'religious', 'moralistic', 'Seven', 'Heaven', 'Good', 'family', 'entertainment', 'couch', 'potatoes', 'agenda', 'person', 'who', 'camping', 'out', 'good', 'inspiration', 'next', 'camping', 'trip', 'Camping', 'good', 'place', 'family', 'bonding']",N/A
