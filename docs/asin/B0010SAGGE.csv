Hogan,"[3, 6]","To Kill a King might be seen as a warning to the west. 300 years before the shah of iran was toppled and replaced with a republic founded on strict religious intolerance, England went through a simnilar chaos. General Thomas Fairfax,{ well played by the Welsh actor Dougray Scott} having defeated the royal troops of Charles 1[Rupert Evertt} with his loyal Oliver Cromwell{the brilliant Tim Roth}, now set out to establish a republic in England. Court intrigue, barons large landowners, the king and Fairfaxs' wife{Olivia Williams, in a virtual non-role} all try to derail the plans of Cromwell. The Round hats are not shown in their intolerance,though it is hinted at. The real battle is beween Fairfax and Cromwell for the consciencee,if not soul, of England. The production values are quite high, typical of an english made costume drama.The beard test[ do the beards look real or do they look like Monty Phython or SNL}is passed , as are the wigs and costumes. There is little action as such[the opening scene is after a battle, with naked corpses being piled up] and most of the action, such as it is, tales place indoors. Only Fairfax is fleshed out, where we believe him to be real.In all, a good,not great movie, a period piece, well worth it for the great Tim Roth and very very Good Dougray Scott.",4,A Parable on Theocracy,1203897600,"02 25, 2008",2008,1307,"['Kill', 'King', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'warning', 'west', '300', 'years', 'shah', 'iran', 'was', 'toppled', 'replaced', 'republic', 'founded', 'strict', 'religious', 'intolerance', 'England', 'went', 'simnilar', 'chaos', 'General', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'well', 'played', 'Welsh', 'actor', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'having', 'defeated', 'royal', 'troops', 'Charles', '1', '[', 'Rupert', 'Evertt', 'loyal', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'brilliant', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'now', 'set', 'out', 'establish', 'republic', 'England', 'Court', 'intrigue', 'barons', 'large', 'landowners', 'king', 'Fairfaxs', 'wife', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'virtual', 'non-role', 'try', 'derail', 'plans', 'Cromwell', 'Round', 'hats', 'are', 'not', 'shown', 'intolerance', 'hinted', 'real', 'battle', 'beween', 'Fairfax', 'Cromwell', 'consciencee', 'not', 'soul', 'England', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'quite', 'high', 'typical', 'english', 'made', 'costume', 'drama.The', 'beard', 'test', '[', 'do', 'beards', 'look', 'real', 'do', 'look', 'Monty', 'Phython', 'SNL', 'passed', 'are', 'wigs', 'costumes', 'little', 'action', 'such', 'opening', 'scene', 'battle', 'naked', 'corpses', 'being', 'piled', 'up', ']', 'most', 'action', 'such', 'tales', 'place', 'indoors', 'Only', 'Fairfax', 'fleshed', 'out', 'where', 'believe', 'be', 'real.In', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'period', 'piece', 'well', 'great', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'very', 'very', 'Good', 'Dougray', 'Scott']",N/A

This one centers on Oliver Cromwell and his friend Sir Thomas Fairfax, triangulated by Thomas' strong and willful wife Anne, played beautifully by Olivia Williams. It is Scottish actor Dougray Scott's virile portrayal of Thomas Fairfax that dominates the film, while Tim Roth's Cromwell is a dour, menacing fellow; not the kind of chap one would care to have a cuppa tea with. Depending on what historian you are reading (Like Hume or Carlyle), or what country you're in (England or Ireland), Cromwell is either thought of as a hero or a villain, and one sees the villainous side of him in this film. In the smaller part of King Charles I, convinced as many were that his rule had been ordained by God, Rupert Everett gives yet another stellar performance.Well directed by Mike Barker, the score by Richard Mitchell greatly enhances the film, and the extras are a minimal ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette; I would have liked a commentary track on this one, to help piece the historical facts (and inconsistencies) together, as the film covers over 12 years of mid 17th century events. Aside from the wartime and prison violence and some gore (close-ups of bloody wounds), and very brief nudity through a veil, it's quite tame and there's nothing that should offend sensitive audiences, and for those that aren't familiar with this tumultuous period in English history ""To Kill a King"" may interest them enough to make further investigation of it.",4,The Turmoil that Cromwell Wrought,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,1580,"['Excellent', 'production', 'values', 'good', 'acting', 'make', 'Kill', 'King', 'entertaining', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'quasi', 'historical', 'dramas', 'one', 'centers', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'friend', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'triangulated', 'Thomas', 'strong', 'willful', 'wife', 'Anne', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'Scottish', 'actor', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'virile', 'portrayal', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'film', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Cromwell', 'dour', 'menacing', 'fellow', 'not', 'kind', 'chap', 'one', 'would', 'care', 'have', 'cuppa', 'tea', 'Depending', 'what', 'historian', 'are', 'reading', 'Hume', 'Carlyle', 'what', 'country', ""'re"", 'England', 'Ireland', 'Cromwell', 'thought', 'hero', 'villain', 'one', 'villainous', 'side', 'film', 'smaller', 'part', 'King', 'Charles', 'convinced', 'many', 'were', 'rule', 'had', 'been', 'ordained', 'God', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'yet', 'stellar', 'performance.Well', 'directed', 'Mike', 'Barker', 'score', 'Richard', 'Mitchell', 'greatly', 'film', 'extras', 'are', 'minimal', 'Scenes', 'featurette', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'commentary', 'track', 'one', 'help', 'piece', 'historical', 'facts', 'inconsistencies', 'together', 'film', '12', 'years', 'mid', '17th', 'century', 'events', 'Aside', 'wartime', 'prison', 'violence', 'gore', 'close-ups', 'bloody', 'wounds', 'very', 'brief', 'nudity', 'veil', 'quite', 'tame', 'nothing', 'should', 'offend', 'sensitive', 'audiences', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'tumultuous', 'period', 'English', 'history', 'Kill', 'King', 'may', 'interest', 'enough', 'make', 'further', 'investigation']",N/A

1125759,A3TNM3C9ENUCFW,B0010SAGGE,"A.M.Boughey ""Poetmaster""","[0, 1]","I'm going to go against what I normally say in a movie review here in that puritans who will no doubt lambaste this film for it's historical inaccuracies and poetic narrative, probably deserve to be heard (in this case). I am all for entertainment, I don't usually care if aspects are distorted in historical based drama, and I appreciate the need for brevity on screen to keep the audience entertained as well as informed.All that said, it's hard to understand how to describe this picture.There is little in the way of action or sex, or high drama for that matter, and the subject material (The English Civil War) is hardly a global moneybag rich for storytelling in the way that say Braveheart, or The Patriot translated onto the screen.Casting is also a BIG problem, mainly by association. Tim Roth, who is a fine actor, has of late played some pretty psychotic and off color roles, and one feels he just doesn't bring enough to the role of Cromwell. History (even from contemporary sources) tells us that Cromwell was devoted family man, who loved music and jokes, also a tolerant tactician who actually suppressed tyrant Presbyterians whilst he searched for a constitutional settlement with the king. Here he is portrayed as an almost sullen ""Socialist"" or marauding Olly North type character with little or no depth. Rupert Everett exudes charm as Charles, and obviously researched the finer points of a king remembered as hardly a ""dandy"" but certainly a well spoken epicurean.Dougray Scott is the best thing about the movie without doubt, his portrayal as Fairfax is gritty, determined and very believable (even if his on screen relationship is historically way off).All in all the movie is not very bad, it's just not very good either, and sort of meanders it's way through the 1hr 40 min run time without any real satisfaction for the viewer.It's a shame, when you consider such an accomplished cast. I would have thought they would have carried this off with more zeal. Hollywood is often criticized for skewed views of history in favor of ""in your face"" entertainment. Here we seem to have gotten the former, sadly without the latter. 3 stars for a stellar cast, 2 for the content.",3,"Mildly entertaining, but historically misplaced.",1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2194,"[""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'what', 'normally', 'say', 'movie', 'review', 'here', 'puritans', 'who', 'will', 'doubt', 'lambaste', 'film', 'historical', 'inaccuracies', 'poetic', 'narrative', 'probably', 'deserve', 'be', 'heard', 'case', 'am', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'care', 'aspects', 'are', 'distorted', 'historical', 'based', 'drama', 'appreciate', 'need', 'brevity', 'screen', 'keep', 'audience', 'entertained', 'as', 'well', 'informed.All', 'said', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'describe', 'picture.There', 'little', 'way', 'action', 'sex', 'high', 'drama', 'matter', 'subject', 'material', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', 'hardly', 'global', 'moneybag', 'rich', 'storytelling', 'way', 'say', 'Braveheart', 'Patriot', 'translated', 'screen.Casting', 'also', 'BIG', 'problem', 'mainly', 'association', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'who', 'fine', 'actor', 'late', 'played', 'pretty', 'psychotic', 'color', 'roles', 'one', 'feels', 'just', ""n't"", 'bring', 'enough', 'role', 'Cromwell', 'History', 'even', 'contemporary', 'sources', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'devoted', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'loved', 'music', 'jokes', 'also', 'tolerant', 'tactician', 'who', 'actually', 'suppressed', 'tyrant', 'Presbyterians', 'whilst', 'searched', 'constitutional', 'settlement', 'king', 'Here', 'portrayed', 'almost', 'sullen', 'Socialist', 'marauding', 'Olly', 'North', 'type', 'character', 'little', 'depth', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'charm', 'Charles', 'obviously', 'researched', 'finer', 'points', 'king', 'remembered', 'hardly', 'dandy', 'certainly', 'well', 'spoken', 'epicurean.Dougray', 'Scott', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'doubt', 'portrayal', 'Fairfax', 'gritty', 'determined', 'very', 'believable', 'even', 'screen', 'relationship', 'historically', 'way', '.All', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'sort', 'meanders', 'way', '1hr', '40', 'min', 'run', 'time', 'real', 'satisfaction', 'viewer.It', 'shame', 'when', 'consider', 'accomplished', 'cast', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'carried', 'off', 'more', 'zeal', 'Hollywood', 'often', 'criticized', 'skewed', 'views', 'history', 'favor', 'face', 'entertainment', 'Here', 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'former', 'sadly', 'latter', '3', 'stars', 'stellar', 'cast', '2', 'content']",N/A
1125760,A9ETDX5K04DY,B0010SAGGE,"Billy J. Hobbs ""Bill Hobbs""","[1, 1]","Perhaps no one does histories better than the British, especially when it's a British subject.  In ""To Kill a King"" director Mike Barker takes on the English Civil War and comes away with yet another interpretation.  Not following the Richard Harris film (""Oliver Cromwell"") from the '70s (an excellent film itself), Barker takes us into the relationship, not so much between the Puritans and King Charles I, but between Lord General Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell.  Fairfax is the military leader of the rebellion while Cromwell is more of the hatchet man, but second in command.  They have been friends for a long time.Not a pleasing interpretation of Cromwell, to say the least, ""To Kill a King"" not only shows this relationship between two intimate friends but it takes a no-holds barred view of Cromwell himself, ruthless, narrow in scope, and Machiavellian, to say the least, in nature.  Just how much is historically accurate is, ala Oliver Stone, up for debate.  This relationship between the two principal characters is probably more ""Hollywood"" than in actuality.  That said, both actors Tim Roth (Cromwell) and Delray Scott (Fairfax) do commendable jobs and are convincing in their roles.  It's easy to imagine Roth as ""Old Ironsides"" who reportedly said in his Irish campaigns ""put your trust in God; but mind to keep your powder dry.""  A zealot, for sure, and a religious fundamentalist (often the same), he was reluctant to show much mercy toward those he believed enemies, both in real life and in this film.Still, as a movie, (and not demanding strict historical accuracy),the film carries well on its own.  Needless to say, whether the film is a metaphor for modern governments or not, it shows the desperation of the times, the political intrigues, the futility of such a situation given the circumstances.  Cromwell's determination, as we know, brought about this Glorious Revolution, which lasted only 11 years (1649-1660) and following his own death and the inability of his son Richard to hold the government, England restored the monarchy when Charles II returned (quite triumphantly) from exile in France to take over where his ill-fated father left off. England hasn't looked back (much) since then.Barker's film, too, can be credited highly in at least two other areas, photography and film score. Both are noteworthy, as is the (almost cameo) performance of Rupert Everett as Charles I, who's made to look far more sympathetic than he actually was. Americans have trouble with the ""divine right"" of kings and so probably find it a bit puzzling (after all, that's what our 1776 was all about, to quote Katherine Hepburn).  Perhaps the filmmakers want to send a political message applicable to today's politicians, but that aside, viewers especially who appreciate period pieces will find this movie worthwhile.",4,A strong view of the English Civil War,1204156800,"02 28, 2008",2008,2833,"['Perhaps', 'one', 'better', 'British', 'especially', 'when', 'British', 'subject', 'Kill', 'King', 'director', 'Mike', 'Barker', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', 'away', 'yet', 'interpretation', 'Not', 'following', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'film', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', ""'70s"", 'excellent', 'film', 'Barker', 'relationship', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Puritans', 'King', 'Charles', 'Lord', 'General', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'Cromwell', 'Fairfax', 'military', 'leader', 'rebellion', 'Cromwell', 'more', 'hatchet', 'man', 'second', 'command', 'have', 'been', 'friends', 'long', 'time.Not', 'pleasing', 'interpretation', 'Cromwell', 'say', 'least', 'Kill', 'King', 'not', 'only', 'relationship', 'two', 'intimate', 'friends', 'no-holds', 'barred', 'view', 'Cromwell', 'ruthless', 'narrow', 'scope', 'Machiavellian', 'say', 'least', 'nature', 'Just', 'how', 'much', 'historically', 'accurate', 'ala', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'up', 'debate', 'relationship', 'two', 'principal', 'characters', 'probably', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'actuality', 'said', 'actors', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Cromwell', 'Delray', 'Scott', 'Fairfax', 'do', 'commendable', 'jobs', 'are', 'convincing', 'roles', 'easy', 'imagine', 'Roth', 'Old', 'Ironsides', 'who', 'reportedly', 'said', 'Irish', 'campaigns', 'put', 'trust', 'God', 'mind', 'keep', 'powder', 'dry', 'zealot', 'sure', 'religious', 'fundamentalist', 'often', 'same', 'was', 'reluctant', 'show', 'much', 'mercy', 'believed', 'enemies', 'real', 'life', 'film.Still', 'movie', 'not', 'demanding', 'strict', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'film', 'well', 'own', 'Needless', 'say', 'film', 'metaphor', 'modern', 'governments', 'not', 'desperation', 'times', 'political', 'intrigues', 'futility', 'such', 'situation', 'given', 'circumstances', 'Cromwell', 'determination', 'know', 'brought', 'Glorious', 'Revolution', 'lasted', 'only', '11', 'years', '1649-1660', 'following', 'own', 'death', 'inability', 'son', 'Richard', 'hold', 'government', 'England', 'restored', 'monarchy', 'when', 'Charles', 'II', 'returned', 'quite', 'triumphantly', 'exile', 'France', 'take', 'over', 'where', 'ill-fated', 'father', 'left', 'off', 'England', ""n't"", 'looked', 'back', 'much', 'then.Barker', 'film', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'highly', 'least', 'two', 'other', 'areas', 'photography', 'film', 'score', 'are', 'noteworthy', 'almost', 'cameo', 'performance', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Charles', 'who', 'made', 'look', 'far', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'actually', 'was', 'Americans', 'have', 'trouble', 'divine', 'right', 'kings', 'so', 'probably', 'find', 'bit', 'puzzling', 'what', '1776', 'was', 'about', 'quote', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'Perhaps', 'filmmakers', 'want', 'send', 'political', 'message', 'applicable', 'today', 'politicians', 'aside', 'viewers', 'especially', 'who', 'appreciate', 'period', 'pieces', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'worthwhile']",N/A

Apparently budget troubles plagued this independent production, and director Barker had to rely more on the interpersonal drama than spectacle.  That said, this is a solid period drama with excellent performances throughout.  The story revolves around the friendship, and later rift, between Lord General Thomas Fairfax and his trusted colleague Oliver Cromwell, as they fought to depose King Charles I and bring a more egalitarian government to England.  However, Fairfax gradually discovers that Cromwell intends to try and execute the king, and to bring about change in a more radical and brutal manner.  Then there is the moderating influence of Fairfax's beloved wife Anne, who is still sympathetic to the king.  The chemistry and conflict between the two men as they begin to separate philosophically and politically is what really drives this film.  The performances are strong: the always-intense Tim Roth is a passionate and volatile Cromwell, while Dougray Scott is stolid and conflicted as Fairfax, Olivia Williams is luminous as Lady Anne, and Rupert Everett is properly arrogant and indignant as the captive King Charles.

However this film focused on one slices of this history and does  good job of covering the historic material while providing an entertaining drama. This is a story of the growing tensions of compatriots Oliver Cromwell and Sir Thomas Fairfax who fought together in the civil war but had divergent views as to the future of King Charles I after he was captured and imprisoned. Tim Roth does a good job of portraying the rigidity and power absorbed Oliver Cromwell as Cromwell moves to execute the king and consolidate power. Rupert Everett is excellent as Charles I, totally convinced that he has been selected by God to rule Great Britain and thus he rigidly resists any attempt to curtail his power and authority. Dougray Scott plays Sir Thomas Fairfax, a member of the nobility that helped fight against the royalists in a bid for expanded power for Parliament. The central drama is between Fairfax and Cromwell but Fairfax is strongly supported by his beautiful wife, Lady Anne Fairfax, played by Olivia Williams. There is some nudity in the film, showing Anne Fairfax partly clothed after she and her husband had made love. However, this was necessary to impress upon the viewer the strong bond between husband and wife and the conflict this created on the political field.  Anne Fairfax was from a strong Royalist family and thus she exerted pressure on her husband to allow her to see the King, to communicate with him, and to lobby to stop his execution.

That was during the mid 1600's, when an army rose up and took power from the throne, unseating King Charles I and establishing a new form of short-lived and much-hated government. The story has been told in the past, but not extensively, and so To Kill a King maintains its uniqueness.War has raged throughout England in recent years, as the people's republic attempt to convince the monarchy that they are not pleased with the current political climate. High taxation has forced many into ruin, and compelled new leaders to take a stand. Foremost among them is Sir Thomas Fairfax (Dougray Scott), whose natural camaraderie with the troops makes him immensely popular. His beautiful, aristocratic wife Lady Anne (Olivia Williams) longs for the fighting to cease so that he might come home. It seems that their armies have forced the king into submission, and the monarch (Rupert Everett) now lies imprisoned within his palace in London. A great cry of freedom arises across the land, for Fairfax is now convinced that they can force the monarch to see reason.But it is not reason his friend and fellow patriot Oliver Cromwell (Tim Roth) demands, but the freedom of a new parliament, the rights to strip the monarchy of all its power, and force him into absolute submission. Lady Anne's loyalties to the aristocracy are stronger than those of her husband, who merely wants to see justice restored to the realm. But King Charles is not about to concede his power or his position, and it becomes a struggle against reform so blatantly corrupt that it turns vicious, replacing the seemingly decadent monarchy that went before it. Soon, Fairfax must choose between his friends or the realization that his efforts have put a corrupt diplomat into power. I did not have high expectations going into this film, but was surprised how decent it turned out to be. My knowledge of the ill-favored Stuart line ends with Charles II, whose story takes place sometime after the conclusion of the film.I have not done an immense amount of research in the period and thus did not know the many political nuances that came into play during those tense months when England held its sovereign hostage. It is not completely historically correct and takes the route of transforming Cromwell into an ambitious, power-hungry dictator, but at the same time it grants the audience a very realistic and sad glimpse into the events that brought about the beheading of a king. If there was one thing that might have been strengthened, it would have been to establish Lady Anne's role with greater weight, because one without a knowledge of aristocratic loyalties to the monarchy might not understand why she was so favorable, and spent so much time with, the king. Other than that, the film is surprisingly adequate. Everett is better known for his humorous roles, but he makes Charles' quiet dignity and occasional moments of absolute fear memorable and heart-wrenching. Williams is absolutely ravishing as the tormented and often manipulated Lady Anne. I'm not a big fan of Scott, but he was more than apt in a role that demanded a man to see the error of his ways. Roth was very good at a compassionate man transformed into a ruthless one.If you are interested in the time period, or the reign of Charles I, you may find fascination in To Kill a King.",3,interesting take on history,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,3441,"['Only', 'once', 'great', 'nation', 'Britain', 'been', 'republic', 'short', 'time', 'monarch', 'overseeing', 'people', 'was', 'mid', '1600', 'when', 'army', 'rose', 'up', 'took', 'power', 'throne', 'unseating', 'King', 'Charles', 'establishing', 'new', 'form', 'short-lived', 'much-hated', 'government', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'past', 'not', 'extensively', 'so', 'Kill', 'King', 'uniqueness.War', 'raged', 'England', 'recent', 'years', 'people', 'republic', 'attempt', 'convince', 'monarchy', 'are', 'not', 'pleased', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'High', 'taxation', 'forced', 'many', 'ruin', 'compelled', 'new', 'leaders', 'take', 'stand', 'Foremost', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'natural', 'camaraderie', 'troops', 'immensely', 'popular', 'beautiful', 'aristocratic', 'wife', 'Lady', 'Anne', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'longs', 'fighting', 'cease', 'so', 'might', 'come', 'home', 'armies', 'have', 'forced', 'king', 'submission', 'monarch', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'now', 'imprisoned', 'palace', 'London', 'A', 'great', 'cry', 'freedom', 'arises', 'land', 'Fairfax', 'now', 'convinced', 'can', 'force', 'monarch', 'see', 'reason.But', 'not', 'reason', 'friend', 'fellow', 'patriot', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'freedom', 'new', 'parliament', 'rights', 'strip', 'monarchy', 'power', 'force', 'absolute', 'submission', 'Lady', 'Anne', 'loyalties', 'aristocracy', 'are', 'stronger', 'husband', 'who', 'merely', 'see', 'justice', 'restored', 'realm', 'King', 'Charles', 'not', 'concede', 'power', 'position', 'struggle', 'reform', 'so', 'blatantly', 'corrupt', 'vicious', 'replacing', 'seemingly', 'decadent', 'monarchy', 'went', 'Soon', 'Fairfax', 'must', 'choose', 'friends', 'realization', 'efforts', 'have', 'put', 'corrupt', 'diplomat', 'power', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'going', 'film', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'decent', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'My', 'knowledge', 'ill-favored', 'Stuart', 'line', 'Charles', 'II', 'story', 'place', 'sometime', 'conclusion', 'film.I', 'have', 'not', 'done', 'immense', 'amount', 'research', 'period', 'thus', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'many', 'political', 'nuances', 'came', 'play', 'tense', 'months', 'when', 'England', 'held', 'sovereign', 'hostage', 'not', 'completely', 'historically', 'correct', 'route', 'transforming', 'Cromwell', 'ambitious', 'power-hungry', 'dictator', 'same', 'time', 'audience', 'very', 'realistic', 'sad', 'glimpse', 'events', 'brought', 'beheading', 'king', 'was', 'one', 'thing', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'strengthened', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'establish', 'Lady', 'Anne', 'role', 'greater', 'weight', 'one', 'knowledge', 'aristocratic', 'loyalties', 'monarchy', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'favorable', 'spent', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'king', 'Other', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'adequate', 'Everett', 'better', 'known', 'humorous', 'roles', 'Charles', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'occasional', 'moments', 'absolute', 'fear', 'memorable', 'heart-wrenching', 'Williams', 'absolutely', 'ravishing', 'tormented', 'often', 'manipulated', 'Lady', 'Anne', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Scott', 'was', 'more', 'apt', 'role', 'demanded', 'man', 'see', 'error', 'ways', 'Roth', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'compassionate', 'man', 'transformed', 'ruthless', 'are', 'interested', 'time', 'period', 'reign', 'Charles', 'may', 'find', 'fascination', 'Kill', 'King']",N/A

Two old friends rejoice the hard-fought victory, Lord General Thomas Fairfax and Deputy General Oliver Cromwell.  It is apparent soon after the king is dethroned that though they both are rejoicing what this will mean for the people they have separate ideas of what should occur next.  Cromwell, played by Tim Roth is outspoken, arrogant and passionate in his beliefs.  He immediately orders a death warrant for King Charles (played wonderfully by Rupert Everett).  Fairfax is the charismatic one, he wants justice at all costs but is the only one that refuses to sign the warrant as no man should be executed without a trial.Through the turn of events after the King is overthrown you see how the friendship between the two deteriorates and how they are both torn with realizing that after gaining so much they have also lost much as men and as friends.I do not know how historically accurate this film is, but it is based on a true story that I have not had much exposure to and I found the time period and the struggle between the two leads to be very engrossing.Cinematography was excellent, both in it's starkness of the war dead and it's grandeur of the palace of King Charles.

As I generally favor such historical film fare, I was quick to order a copy.  Some internet research suggested that reaction to the film by viewers and critics was split, with a lot of comments about the fictionalized moments in the script.  I wish I knew a bit more about the precise facts of the Reformation Period in England in order to correctly determine the truth of such events as the saving of Cromwell's life by his friend, Fairfax which is so much in dispute here.  All the same, I was pleased to find  this picture to be a mature, thoughtful and absorbing piece. The stark, atmospheric lighting and cinematography, literate dialogue, convincing performances by the cast, etc...... all contributed to a thoroughly engrossing and satisfying film.  A viewing of the very interesting, if imperfect, earlier movie, ""Cromwell"", starring Richard Harris in the lead role, makes it very clear that this newer dramatization approaches the character of Oliver Cromwell with a radically altered bias.  From what I have read and heard in the past, this leader of The Roundheads was controversial from the moment he emerged on history's stage, and remains the subject of many arguments about his heroism, or lack thereof, and his contribution to the way England was governed.  Most seem to concur that he was a stern and rigid fellow, who believed unwaveringly in his own moral perspective, and could be ruthless and brutal with those he opposed.

The entire film keeps its focus sharply on this conflict.  I found it engrossing.  One of my direct ancestors, John Craggen (of Scotland), was conscripted into the Royalist army and subsequently captured by Cromwell's forces.  He was kept in chains for two years and then sold as a slave and shipped to Massachusetts on the John & Mary.  Later, after Royalty was restored in England, some of Cromwell's generals were sheltered from British authorities through safe houses in New England.  The ideals of Cromwell's struggle were later realized in the American Revolution (""all men are created equal...""), more than 100 years later, supported by the descendents of both Royalists and Republicans who fled to the New World.

You can read the synopsis, but briefly, it covers a period of years at the end of the English Civil War, right when the rebels win, execute the king (Charles I, played adeptly by Everett), and take over the government. The subplot is the strained friendship between Oliver Cromwell (Roth) and his charismatic general, Lord Fairfax (Scott).This is a generally good costume drama, although I felt like it skimmed over some of the history, pushing through a few years and only briefly touching on things like why the English was fighting against Charles I (it's only mentioned in passing, so a viewer unfamiliar with the history would be unsure whether they should sympathize with Charles or not). Scott's Fairfax is meant to be beguiling, charming, and a born leader, but I found him a bit limp. Scott didn't seem to have the oozing charisma to infuse in his portrayal of someone who inspired a country to rebel against the institution that is the monarchy. Roth is always very good, and this is no exception. I found the tension between his Cromwell and Lady Fairfax (Olivia Williams) very good. Besides Scott's strictly OK performance and the skimping on the history, I only had one more minor criticism, and that is that the camera work was a bit jolting or odd in a few places.Don't expect this to be as sumptuous as other costume dramas, such as Elizabeth or The Duchess, but you will definitely enjoy the film if you are interested in this period of history and in the actors who reenact it.",3,Enjoyable for History and Costume Drama Enthusiasts,1235779200,"02 28, 2009",2009,1951,"['had', 'never', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'when', 'ordered', 'Amazon', 'Vine', 'program', 'interest', 'was', 'piqued', 'subject', 'matter', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', '1645', 'cast', 'surprisingly', 'well-known', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'Olivia', 'Williams', '.Despite', 'film', 'obscurity', 'least', 'fact', 'little', 'typical', 'period', 'interest', 'English', 'history', 'Tudors', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'entertained', 'can', 'read', 'synopsis', 'briefly', 'period', 'years', 'end', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', 'right', 'when', 'rebels', 'win', 'execute', 'king', 'Charles', 'played', 'adeptly', 'Everett', 'take', 'government', 'subplot', 'strained', 'friendship', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'Roth', 'charismatic', 'general', 'Lord', 'Fairfax', 'Scott', '.This', 'generally', 'good', 'costume', 'drama', 'felt', 'skimmed', 'history', 'pushing', 'few', 'years', 'only', 'briefly', 'touching', 'things', 'why', 'English', 'was', 'fighting', 'Charles', 'only', 'mentioned', 'passing', 'viewer', 'unfamiliar', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'unsure', 'should', 'sympathize', 'Charles', 'not', 'Scott', 'Fairfax', 'meant', 'be', 'beguiling', 'charming', 'born', 'leader', 'found', 'bit', 'limp', 'Scott', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'oozing', 'charisma', 'infuse', 'portrayal', 'someone', 'who', 'inspired', 'country', 'rebel', 'institution', 'monarchy', 'Roth', 'always', 'very', 'good', 'exception', 'found', 'tension', 'Cromwell', 'Lady', 'Fairfax', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'very', 'good', 'Scott', 'strictly', 'OK', 'performance', 'skimping', 'history', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'more', 'minor', 'criticism', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'bit', 'jolting', 'odd', 'few', 'places.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'be', 'as', 'sumptuous', 'other', 'costume', 'dramas', 'such', 'Elizabeth', 'Duchess', 'will', 'definitely', 'enjoy', 'film', 'are', 'interested', 'period', 'history', 'actors', 'who', 'reenact']",N/A

Fuchs ""jax76""","[5, 8]","I was expecting this not to be a very good movie given the fact that I had never heard of it and that a quick search to find out why revealed extensive financial problems with the movie's completion.  It is, however, quite a good historical drama with an emphasis, as other reviewers have noted, on the political side rather than the military. This tends to work to the film's advantage as it gives the filmmakers plenty of time to let us get into the lives and the heads of Oliver Cromwell, who was the head of the New Model Army and the parliamentary party that was in opposition to the oppressive rule of King Charles I of England, and more particularly to Lord Thomas Fairfax, who was the general of the New Model Army and, according to this film, a very close friend of Oliver Cromwell.  The film compresses the time periods known as the First Civil War and the Second Civil War, focusing instead on the political battle between Parliament and the King and, ultimately, between Cromwell and Fairfax, a battle that Fairfax lost when Cromwell persuaded Parliament to execute the King without trial.The direction and performances are good almost across-the-board, but what takes the movie down to four stars for me is the depiction of Oliver Cromwell. Tim Roth does everything but twirl his mustache, playing Cromwell as a sort of Stuart-era Snidely Whiplash.  Since Roth is a superb actor, I have to assume that this is how Cromwell was written, or perhaps how Roth was directed.  The movie is supposed to be about the friendship between Cromwell and Fairfax but we never really see this, at least not until the very end of the film.  You would never know from this movie that Cromwell himself was an excellent military commander or that what appeared to motivate him more than a sense of justice for all English men or a sense of outrage over the abuses of King Charles was his Puritan religion.  It's very difficult to get a sense of why men followed him and why, in particular Lord Fairfax loved him as much as we are told he did.  Cromwell as presented here never smiles, is tyrannical, and from the get-go appears worse than anything we've heard about the King.  There is very little evidence of the meaningful relationship between Fairfax and Cromwell that the filmmakers say they intended.  I kept wondering what it is that kept the two men bonded once the war was over.  It's not an easy thing to figure out, but it is to the credit of these two fine actors that they eventually make you believe it, at least a little.Rupert Everett, who had so much evident fun playing Charles II in Stage Beauty, gets the opportunity to shine a little more subtly as Charles I's crown and life were taken from him.  He is every inch a king who believes he owes his crown to God's grace and to divine right.  There is no common ground between his view and that of Cromwell so King Charles has to die.We all know the excesses Cromwell comitted as Lord protector of England so I would very much have liked to see more of the man, the one ordinary Englanders would follow into battle and risk abandoning their king for.  You can talk all you want in the movie about how much Cromwell's men love him, but we never really see it.  We just see a monster who at the end, makes a few good speeches.Production values are good, costumes are excellent and tech credits definately fine overall.  Bonus features are nearly non-existent.  A trailer and a ""behind-the-scenes"" type ad that is short and just a little informative for those who haven't seen the movie.  The rest of the bonuses are a trailer for To Kill a King and three other movies (like Beowulf).  Nothing to get excited about.  A pretty good effort on the movie, but you'll probably have more questions than you started with.  Although if it inspires you to seek out the answers, I guess it's done its job.

But then Charles attempts a political comeback with a few well-placed bribes and Cromwell resorts to having the monarch's lopped off, a solution to the problem that his friend and erstwhile commander, Fairfax, opposes. It doesn't help that the latter's wife, Lady Anne (Olivia Williams), is not only a royalist but the King's platonic friend. Fairfax and Cromwell have a falling out.I found TO KILL A KING vaguely disappointing on a couple of levels. As an entertainment vehicle, I expect a sumptuous and historical costume epic to have an heroic protagonist for whom to cheer. What wouldEl Cid,Ben-Hur,Elizabeth,BraveheartandA Man for All Seasonsbe without such? In any case, TO KILL A KING comes up short in this regard. The viewer of royalist sympathies has only the petulant and whining Charles, albeit well done by Everett. Fairfax, the most obvious candidate for the honor and sympathetically portrayed by Scott as an admirable and good man, is ineffective at opposing Cromwell at best and wooly in his relationship with his sovereign at worst. Cromwell, of course, is the villain of the piece.As usual, Hollywood plays fast and loose with history in order to maximize the story. The basic facts are there, of course. Fairfax commanded the New Model Army; Cromwell, his deputy, eventually became Lord Protector; Charles lost his head on the block. But Fairfax's role was even more ambiguous in the affair than portrayed. Indeed, the film would have the viewer infer that Cromwell's elevation to Lord Protector and his estrangement from Fairfax happened just a couple of days after the King's execution. Yet, the former occurred in December 1653, and the latter in January 1649; Thomas remained active in the Parliamentarian regime until 1850. And the events surrounding Cromwell's investiture, as portrayed on the Big Screen, were pure fantasies hallucinated by the screenwriters.As an irrelevant aside, the period costumes, which I assume were accurately portrayed, made everyone look positively silly. Imagine Dubya in a flat, broad-brimmed black hat and a lace collar and you'll get the picture.I'm awarding a generous four stars solely for the performance of Tim Roth. He can play the role of Sinister Little Weasel better than any actor of whom I'm aware. (Remember Roth's Archibald Cunningham inRob Roy?)I see that TO KILL A KING was released in 2003.

To Kill a King stars Tim Roth, Rupert Everett and Dougray Scott.Americans have a limited view of their own history, and so it would not surprise me if a poll of Americans would reveal that the majority of Americans have no idea that England has had several civil wars.  As for me, even before reading the history, I first was introduced to the Roundheads and Cavaliers in a Choose Your Own Adventure book, of all things.So I know a little bit about the story of Cromwell going into this dramatic rendition of the events that lead up to the death of Charles I and the establishment of the brief English Republic.  The movie centers around Sir Thomas Fairfax (Dougray Scott) General of the Puritan army and friend to Cromwell.  Roth plays Cromwell, the heart and soul of the Puritans.Everett plays Charles I, the king whose self-confidence and excesses threaten to remove the crown from his head...and his head from his body.I was somewhat disappointed. The movie has a strong Royalist bias, for one thing.Cromwell is painted early and often as a psychopath. (The choice of Roth to play him was not lost on me).  Early on, he nearly kills a man senselessly and needlessly. This characterization continues throughout the movie.  The movie, too, depicts the trial of Charles in a short and perfunctory manner, which dilutes the performance of Everett in the role. He's simply not given a lot to work with here, as the movie focuses on Fairfax and Cromwell. And the center of the movie, Fairfax, is portrayed by Scott in only an average performance.Even as there were so few female performances in the movie, I thought Olivia Williams did all right as Lady Fairfax.The direction of the movie, I thought, was poor to middling. Especially when the movie does anything other than characters talking or conversing in a room, the cinematography reveals itself to be underdone at best.  (One scene of Fairfax rushing through his house is particularly bad but its only one of the more egregious examples).The movie does gets points in my book for tackling subjects and characters which don't get much cinematic depiction.

When I found the Blu-Ray edition selling for $9.96 at Wal-Mart, I couldn't pass it up.  I definitely recommend Blu-Ray. I would have given it 5 stars but the dialogue is a little muddled.The movie explores the development of our notions about ""Authority"" and ""Legitimacy"". The movie suggests that the current thinking was that the authority to rule comes from God and not the people.  The Divine Right of Kings was an integral part of religious views.  To challenge the notion of Divine Right would be to challenge the core religious beliefs of society.  In the movie, Sir Thomas Fairfax and his wife Lady Anne believe in the Divine Right of Kings.  Thomas, however, believes that the King should be removed from power where as his wife (and all her family) did not.  The general thinking in England sided with Thomas.  Oliver Cromwell believed that the authority to rule came from the people, and, wanted to see the monarchy eliminated. He believed that the Divine Right of Kings was just an excuse to control, oppress and dominate.The movie primarily focuses on Sir Thomas Fairfax and his efforts to maintain his relationships to both his wife and to Cromwell despite their differences.  Cromwell's treatment of the King and the King's eventual trial and beheading, completely severs the relationship between Fairfax and Cromwell.The representation of the period as will as the Cinematography is excellent.

There certainly is an effort to reproduce some of the known history and factual events but much of the movie concerns itself with what the main charachers felt or might have felt.It might have been more interesting to see actual battles and fights (Some ACTION) rather than just talking and drama. Especially since the misleading box for the DVD shows battles! It also might have been interesting to see some other events in Cromwell's life at this time, such as his controversial invasion of Ireland. The movie is very well acted and they make the most of it. One interesting or curious thing is that they make Lady Fairfax a strong and dominant character while they make Lady Cromwell trivial and insignificant- how and why they reach that conclusion is not explained.

There isn't a false note anywhere. Not many films can boast that. The cast is uniformly close to perfection, particularly Dougray Scott(playing Sir Thomas Fairfax) and the beautiful Olivia Williams (as his wife Lady Anne.) Their realistic emotional interplay, with their characters almost painfully at odds at times, is breathtaking to behold, helped by a very literate script.The film concentrates on the bond--almost a mutual love--bewteen Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, and the interplay of Lady Anne to this bond. Never do the historical aspects of the film overshadow the emotional aspects. That's a difficult balancing act, and only a few great directors (notably David Lean) have been able to pull it off successfully. I would add this film to that list. It deserves to be seen by a wide audience.My only small gripe is that the DVD doesn't have any subtitles to choose from; there are times when the dialogue is difficult to understand--at least from this American viewer's point of view.

The film itself is not cheap or badly shot.  It is as good as any other history film about (""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" for example.)The simple reason for the criticism is that the audience waiting for this film wanted something a bit more realistic and historically accurate.  This is a subject that fascinates me (having read Antonia Frasier's ""Cromwell"" and ""Charles II"" plus ""The Trial of Charles I: A Documentary History"").  Sadly, there is too much going on to satisfy in almost all directions.  We don't get to see much of the trial of Charles I, we don't get to see any of the Civil War, Pride's Purge is fairly swiftly done, and then we get a massive time lapse of Cromwell's rise and fall all in an hour and a half.  Too much is happening and not enough time to allow the audience to care.To say this is a bad movie, however, is just wrong.  I suggest that the producers didn't quite understand the audience for this subject as most costume dramas are aimed at a female audience.  However, there truly isn't anything feminine in this story (Fairfax's wife's time on screen is a little overdone.)  All this could have been fixed with a longer runtime and a bit slower pace.Since we aren't likely to see another film on this subject again in the near future, this is worth a look.",4,Too short a film for too big a subject,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1428,"['Kill', 'King', 'well', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'couple', 'years', 'region', '1', 'release', 'Initial', 'reviews', 'were', 'very', 'mild', 'not', 'mean', 'film', 'not', 'cheap', 'badly', 'shot', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'history', 'film', 'Elizabeth', 'Golden', 'Age', 'example', 'simple', 'reason', 'criticism', 'audience', 'waiting', 'film', 'wanted', 'something', 'bit', 'more', 'realistic', 'historically', 'accurate', 'subject', 'having', 'read', 'Antonia', 'Frasier', 'Cromwell', 'Charles', 'II', 'Trial', 'Charles', 'Documentary', 'History', 'Sadly', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'satisfy', 'almost', 'directions', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'much', 'trial', 'Charles', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Civil', 'War', 'Pride', 'Purge', 'fairly', 'swiftly', 'done', 'then', 'get', 'massive', 'time', 'lapse', 'Cromwell', 'rise', 'fall', 'all', 'hour', 'half', 'Too', 'much', 'happening', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'allow', 'audience', 'care.To', 'say', 'bad', 'movie', 'however', 'just', 'wrong', 'suggest', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'audience', 'subject', 'most', 'costume', 'dramas', 'are', 'aimed', 'female', 'audience', 'However', 'truly', ""n't"", 'anything', 'feminine', 'story', 'Fairfax', 'wife', 'time', 'screen', 'little', 'overdone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'longer', 'runtime', 'bit', 'slower', 'pace.Since', 'are', ""n't"", 'likely', 'see', 'film', 'subject', 'again', 'near', 'future', 'look']",N/A

Sc. 2.Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Fairfax led the Puritan revolt against Charles I that resulted in what as known as the Civil Wars. In the mind of Cromwell and his supporters, Charles I led a series of bloody civil wars against the Parliamentary forces that challenged Charles I's right to absolute rule. These civil wars caused the death of approximately 10% of Britain's adult males. It was a bloody time. Eventually, Cromwell and his supporters determined that the only way to end the civil wars was to put Charles I to trial. The trial and subsequent execution of Charles I was a watershed event that left England a republic (albeit only temporarily) and created the legal theory that tyranny was not a right of rulers but a crime against the ruled.  The trial destroyed forever the right of kings to act with impunity from justice and the principles established at this trial still exist today and were evident at trials from Nuremberg to Yugoslavia.""To Kill a King"" sets out to tell the story of the trial and execution of King Charles I at the hands of Oliver Cromwell and his republican/Puritan army.  However, the film's centerpiece is not, sad to say, the trial of Charles I but, rather, the complex and emotional relationship between Oliver Cromwell and his closest ally, Lord General Thomas Fairfax.  The result is a film that, while interesting in its own right, misses the opportunity to explore one of history's most important events.Director Mike Barker (and his cinematographer) does a commendable job in evoking the horror of the Civil Wars.  The opening scene in particular, a scene shot at the end of a battle, gives the viewer a good idea of the devastation and havoc the war had on the English people.  Tim Roth, as Oliver Cromwell and Dougray Scott play off against each other very well.  Best of friends and comrades at arms Cromwell and Fairfax together secure victory after victory for their armies.  As the film opens Fairfax, a great and popular general, was squarely in the republican camp.  However, as the puritan revolution took hold Fairfax and his wife (played by Olivia Williams) begin to recoil at the excesses that most revolutions eventually fall prey to.  The heart of the film involves the gulf that grows between the two friends as the revolution begins to devour its own.  Rupert Everett does an excellent job portraying Charles I.  He conveys the host of personality quirks of the king, at once foppish and nave yet also cunning and far from unintelligent, as he tries desperately to find a way out of his rather comfortable house arrest. The trial itself is well done, if played out a bit superficially.  The final `estrangement' between Cromwell and Fairfax is probably the strongest part of the film.All in all this film is worth watching. However, it is worth watching not because it provides any great insights into the Civil War(s) and the trial of Charles I.  Rather, it is a decent drama about two friends and their turbulent relationship.  The War and Charles I are merely backdrop, even if the backdrop is well thought out and historically accurate.This is a good film to put in your queue and provides good entertainment if you are in the mood for a lively period piece.  The DVD had no `extras' worth mentioning.Anyone interested in an excellent book on the trial and execution of Charles I would likely enjoyThe Tyrannicide Brief: The Story of the Man Who Sent Charles I to the Scaffold.L.

1125795,A33WFRICMYRPT6,B0010SAGGE,"M.A. Hallisey ""Potius mori quam foedari!""","[8, 11]","Great as a movie (5 stars), horrible as history (1.5 stars).Indisputably, ""The Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell"" remains a controversial figure in UK history.  For those only mildly interested in Cromwell's place in British history, one only needs to know that it is hard to find a neutral (or unimpassioned) opinion.  He either presided over a tumultuous period which did in fact move England much further forward than was able to be earlier seen, or he was a dictator in the line of Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, Stalin, the Taliban, or even the (seems impossible to find except in the left-leaning pubs) Right-Wing Fundamentalist Christian zealot fanatics.""To Kill a King"" is an unabashed anti-Cromwell tirade and by extension, Christianity.  Tim Roth is superb, but plays Cromwell as a fanatic, knavish gnome.  As portrayed, Cromwell is an intolerant and brutal zealot who desires nothing more than to make his form of Christianity (Puritanism) the religion of the nation.  But this view is in direct contradiction to ALL history.  Cromwell's Puritanism has been given an extremely bad rap and the situation in England was far more complicated than depicted.  The English common folk may not all have wanted King Charles deposed, but an extraordinarily high percentage stood back in aghast at the hypocrisy of their so-called pious and Christian king (and his court).  In the end, Cromwell did represent the overall expectations of the English common folk.  In keeping with his desire to remain with the people, we must also remember that Cromwell was offered the crown and refused, hoping that a republic of freely elected legislators would develop.  In the end, if Cromwell was horrible, than so too were our founding Mayflower Pilgrims (and early New England). They were of the same view - both wanted desperately to escape the religious intolerance Charles and his Church of England supported.  Speaking of the Pilgrims, there is good evidence to suggest that Cromwell was preparing to emigrate to New England with his family when the political upheavals began.  But he was drawn into the struggle due to a sense of duty to shire and as we know from history was never able to withdraw.Lord Thomas Fairfax (Dougray Scott - superb) and his wife, the Lady Anne (played really quite well by Olivia Williams) come across as the voices of reason, and our opinion of Fairfax is clearly that of the Lady Anne (regardless of the end-of-movie Fairfax voice-overs).  Anne desires to keep her place (and the place of her children) in society intact and it is through that prism we see Cromwell.  She is nobility, Cromwell is a country gentleman.  As such, she could never see him for anything but a vulgar pretender.  The movie does not play her as a saint, but through the use of a few clever gimmicks (the highlighting of a miscarriage for instance), the viewer finds oneself slowly taking the script's anti-Cromwell position.  Good drama, horrible history, good editorial.  One final point.  There is little historical evidence (which is to say, none) that Fairfax attempted to kill Cromwell or even that their falling out was so severe.As I alluded to above, the movie has to play it this way in order to frame Cromwell as a religious fanatic and brutal oppressor.  Even the closing screens keep up the anti-Cromwell tirade.  For the movie's writer and the director, the English Civil Wars were really ""Cromwell's Revolution"" (a description favored by Marxist historians).  But once again, good drama, bad history.  The Commonwealth and then the Protectorate suffered from many maladies - no treasury, enemies within and without, inexperienced leaders, a renewed Royal threat from Scotland and in the end, no tradition of Republic. England did return to a monarchy, but the Civil Wars did indeed move England several significant steps forward.  Much of what Cromwell (and Fairfax) strove to put in place (most importantly, rule by the King with the consent of the People (Parliament)) did stick. While it is true that England has never again become a Republic (as the closing screen trumpets), the ability of the British monarch to rule absolutely ended at Charles' execution.  Since the Commonwealth/Protectorate, ruling power in England has moved inexorably to Parliament so that now the British monarch is essentially decorative.  So while Englishmen may still proudly call themselves ""subjects of the Crown,"" they know in their hearts that England is pretty much a Republic (and very much the type of Republic Cromwell hoped for before the King so badly played his final cards forcing Cromwell (and many others) to believe that the King had to face trial and then execution as a traitor). As an aside, I would be remiss if I failed to mention Rupert Everett's take on Charles I - wonderful and every bit as good (perhaps better) as Sir Alec Guinness in the 1967 film ""Cromwell"" (starring Richard Harris in the title role).Though Cromwell's ""Irish Question"" is not mentioned in any regard in the movie, a quick comment must be made in that I believe it helps further frame the discussion. For many whose Irish forbears suffered greatly under English rule (as mine did), Cromwell remains today a hated figure (even if only because parents and grand-parents have said so).  However, as with everything else during that time, the issue was far more complicated than stating Cromwell beat down the Irish to satisfy personal (specifically, religious) desires.  While Cromwell's treatment of the Irish was harsh, it was far less harsh than what was handed out to the Irish by most of the English monarchs.  For instance (if I remember correctly), it was Henry VIII who deforested Ireland as a means of removing hiding places for the opposition and put into motion a process that eventually resulted in one of the greatest famines in history - the 1840s Potato Famine .  And it was the monarchy that continued to string along the Irish until a double-cross by the British government in the teens of the 20th century caused another famous split (de Valera & Michael Collins) and thus birthed the Irish Civil War.  So who really was ""the monster""?By the middle of the 17th century, Charles' English monarchy was devilishly duplicitous and the common people paid for it.  Few of the nobles desired to see that (even those who remained in Parliament and did not side with the King).  Fairfax, to his credit, did and sided with the Parliamentary Roundheads and stood for real reform and Parliamentary rule.  But he (and his wife) were still, in the end, nobility.  As the movie is framed from Fairfax's wife Anne's perspective, Cromwell could be nothing more than a vulgar commoner and nothing less than a devilish monster.  The movie expects us to stand back in horror at the evils done in the name of religion run-amuck (specifically, Christianity) and absolute dictatorship.  I guess that means the writer and director expect the viewer to side with the privileged rich?  Wow! I wouldn't have thought a movie which adopts the Marxist view on Cromwell and that period would do that.  But then again, much of what passes for ""Marxist history"" got it and continues to get it wrong.  I guess so do its adherents.Well, enough said (or written).  In the end, my view of the movie remains neatly summarized by this review's title - ""Really Nicely-Filmed Movie. Great Acting. Horrible History.""",4,Really Nicely-Filmed Movie. Great Acting.

1125797,A16IM9MYTHCKYQ,B0010SAGGE,Penumbra,"[0, 0]","""To Kill A King"" is a 2003 film primarily about the relationship between Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell following the battles of the English Civil War.  The movie appears to have bypassed theaters almost entirely and has taken five years to make it to DVD release, not surprising given the high brow connotation of the subject and the low brow nature of audiences.The story is told from the point of view of Sir Thomas Fairfax (Dougray Scott), a nobleman who became the Lord General of the Parliamentary forces.  What comes across in the film is that Fairfax has gone against his class to do what he thought was right in opposing the oppression of the monarchy.  Fairfax is a brilliant general, and a man with a truly noble character.  He is beloved by the men he leads in battle, and he is loved by the population at large.  Fairfax loves his wife, his unborn son, his hereditary estate - and, for reasons which are not made clear in this movie, he loves Oliver Cromwell.Cromwell's frequent gratuitous acts of violence or petty acts of tyranny to those around him, including his wife, contrast sharply with Fairfax's native nobility and leadership.  Tim Roth has made a career of portraying psychopaths and Cromwell is no exception.  A would be assassin raises a blade against Cromwell; Fairfax fells the man with a well placed bullet; Cromwell must go over and repeatedly kick the wounded man as he lies on the ground.  Or in another scene, Cromwell rides through London and spots an elderly street vendor selling Charles I relics.  Cromwell shoots the man twice, once shattering his leg and the second time tearing his throat.  He then rides off unconcerned, leaving Fairfax to put the old man out of his misery.Fairfax has envisioned the result of the war to be parliamentary checks on the power of the king.  He is horrified by the warrant calling for the king's execution, and will not sign it.  He is horrified once again when Cromwell declares himself Lord Protector of the Commonwealth.  As the most popular figure to emerge from the Civil War, Fairfax feels it is his duty to do something to stop the man that Cromwell has become.  At the same time, Fairfax is torn because of their close friendship.Much has been made of the budget problems on this film.  I don't think the budgetary problems are visually apparent on the screen.  There are plenty of elaborate costumes, horses, castles, and on location footage.  If what was missing was additional battle scenes then I, for one, didn't miss them.  The film has plenty of violence, but considering the 17th century subject it doesn't go over the top.Where the film should have spent more money was in the writing.  The events surrounding the English Civil Wars should be a writer's paradise of heroes, villains, intrigue, regicide, and more.  ""To Kill A King"" comes across tame.  Comparisons to 1970's ""Cromwell"" are inevitable.  ""Cromwell"" was a problematic film but, compared to this one, it had a script that dripped poetry and fire.  Tim Roth is no Richard Harris.  Alec Guinness did much more with the character of Charles I than Rupert Everett, but Everett was brave to take it on and did an adequate job considering the script.  That being said, the great movie treatment of this epic story has yet to be made.The DVD special features are practically non-existent.  There is a ""behind the scenes"" feature that doesn't add much to the package, and several trailers for other releases.  (I find it irritating when non-related trailers are used to pad out the ""special features"" section of DVDs.)  There are no captions or subtitles available.The ""To Kill A King"" DVD package gets three stars from me.  If you're looking for a costume drama, this isn't bad.  If you're looking for history, you had better pick up a book.",3,The great movie treatment of this story has yet to be made....,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,3793,"['Kill', 'A', 'King', '2003', 'film', 'primarily', 'relationship', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell', 'following', 'battles', 'English', 'Civil', 'War', 'movie', 'have', 'bypassed', 'theaters', 'almost', 'entirely', 'taken', 'five', 'years', 'make', 'DVD', 'release', 'not', 'surprising', 'given', 'high', 'brow', 'connotation', 'subject', 'low', 'brow', 'nature', 'audiences.The', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Sir', 'Thomas', 'Fairfax', 'Dougray', 'Scott', 'nobleman', 'who', 'became', 'Lord', 'General', 'Parliamentary', 'forces', 'What', 'across', 'film', 'Fairfax', 'gone', 'class', 'do', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'opposing', 'oppression', 'monarchy', 'Fairfax', 'brilliant', 'general', 'man', 'truly', 'noble', 'character', 'beloved', 'men', 'battle', 'loved', 'population', 'large', 'Fairfax', 'wife', 'unborn', 'son', 'hereditary', 'estate', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'Cromwell.Cromwell', 'frequent', 'gratuitous', 'acts', 'violence', 'petty', 'acts', 'tyranny', 'including', 'wife', 'contrast', 'sharply', 'Fairfax', 'native', 'nobility', 'leadership', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'made', 'career', 'portraying', 'psychopaths', 'Cromwell', 'exception', 'would', 'be', 'assassin', 'blade', 'Cromwell', 'Fairfax', 'man', 'well', 'placed', 'bullet', 'Cromwell', 'must', 'go', 'repeatedly', 'kick', 'wounded', 'man', 'ground', 'scene', 'Cromwell', 'London', 'spots', 'elderly', 'street', 'vendor', 'selling', 'Charles', 'relics', 'Cromwell', 'shoots', 'man', 'twice', 'once', 'shattering', 'leg', 'second', 'time', 'tearing', 'throat', 'then', 'unconcerned', 'leaving', 'Fairfax', 'put', 'old', 'man', 'misery.Fairfax', 'envisioned', 'result', 'war', 'be', 'parliamentary', 'checks', 'power', 'king', 'horrified', 'warrant', 'calling', 'king', 'execution', 'will', 'not', 'sign', 'horrified', 'once', 'again', 'when', 'Cromwell', 'Lord', 'Protector', 'Commonwealth', 'most', 'popular', 'figure', 'emerge', 'Civil', 'War', 'Fairfax', 'duty', 'do', 'something', 'stop', 'man', 'Cromwell', 'become', 'same', 'time', 'Fairfax', 'torn', 'close', 'friendship.Much', 'been', 'made', 'budget', 'problems', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'budgetary', 'problems', 'are', 'visually', 'apparent', 'screen', 'are', 'plenty', 'elaborate', 'costumes', 'horses', 'castles', 'location', 'footage', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'was', 'additional', 'battle', 'scenes', 'then', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'film', 'plenty', 'violence', 'considering', '17th', 'century', 'subject', ""n't"", 'go', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'money', 'was', 'writing', 'events', 'surrounding', 'English', 'Civil', 'Wars', 'should', 'be', 'writer', 'paradise', 'heroes', 'villains', 'intrigue', 'regicide', 'more', 'Kill', 'A', 'King', 'tame', 'Comparisons', '1970', 'Cromwell', 'are', 'inevitable', 'Cromwell', 'was', 'problematic', 'film', 'compared', 'one', 'had', 'script', 'dripped', 'poetry', 'fire', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Alec', 'Guinness', 'did', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'Charles', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'Everett', 'was', 'brave', 'take', 'did', 'adequate', 'job', 'considering', 'script', 'being', 'said', 'great', 'movie', 'treatment', 'epic', 'story', 'yet', 'be', 'made.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'practically', 'non-existent', 'scenes', 'feature', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'package', 'several', 'trailers', 'other', 'releases', 'find', 'irritating', 'when', 'non-related', 'trailers', 'are', 'used', 'pad', 'out', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'DVDs', 'are', 'captions', 'available.The', 'Kill', 'A', 'King', 'DVD', 'package', 'three', 'stars', ""'re"", 'looking', 'costume', 'drama', ""n't"", 'bad', ""'re"", 'looking', 'history', 'had', 'better', 'pick', 'up', 'book']",N/A

I always thought (wrongly) that Charles I was executed for his catholic beliefs but this film has clarified that issue much better for me.  In 1640s England has an absolute ruler, citizens were king's subjects with limited liberty and personal rights, power was corrupt. Britain was politically divided and most felt that the only way to bring the change for the country was by raising civil war.  Reformist win the revolution and before long, Oliver Cromwell assumes power as a Protector of Land.  His close friend Lord Fairfax suddently realizes that Cromwell is more interested in gaining power that bringing reforms and laws in place. Lord Fairfax's wife Anne is devout to King and her quiet beauty and cleverness is used by all around Fairfax in order to change balance of power.  I was mesmerized by Rupert Everett's portrayal of King Charles I who is so determined to exercise his right as a ruler that no imprisonment can bend his will.  He cultivates his personal strenght by being involved in political intrigues, brokering deals and having Lady Fairfax make him company by singing and reading with him.This is a beautiful costume drama, touching up on the important part of the British history that focuses less on battleship spectacles and more on political manipulation of power.  Tim Roth also gives amazing portrayal of Oliver Cromwell.  But most of all it is great to watch Cromwell and Fairfax who after being inseparable friends fall apart forever.  The ambition that bound them together also pulled them apart.

The film follows the rise and fall of Oliver Cromwell, including the death of King Charles, with a focus on the friendship of Cromwell and General Thomas Fairfax.I think that it might be difficult to follow, for those who are not familiar with England's Civil War (which is probably most of us here in the U.S.), but the relationships and viewpoints are presented with a surprising level of compassion for the various points of view. A number of questions about power, rights, freedom, ethics, and priorities arise in thought-provoking fashion, though they flash quickly by in the course of the action. It may be that there is a shorthand going on for the intended British audience, who were presumed to be up on all the relevant issues, but it started some interesting conversations among my family.In historical movies that focus on war and power, women are often obviously only in the frame to act as scenery, but that is not the case here.

The film revolves around three major players,  Oliver Cromwell, his friend, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and the King, Charles Stewart.  The setting is immediately after the victory of the Parliamentary forces, led by Cromwell and General Fairfax, against the Royalist forces.  The King is defeated but still the King.  He refuses to compromise on important aspects of what he regards as his God-Given Authority--such as the authority to render arbitrary judgments.  This, of course, sets him distinctly at odds with Cromwell.  Parliament is bribed and cajoled to favor the King's position and Cromwell dissolves Parliament at the point of a gun.By this time, Cromwell's old friend and buddy, Thomas, is getting uneasy.  He has, after all, fought for the primacy of Parliament.  Cromwell, realizing that his revolution is not complete until there is no King, holds a drumhead trial in which the King is convicted and condemned to die on the block.  Now, Thomas is really uneasy and his squeamishness starts to affect his friendship with Cromwell.The King is executed.  Cromwell raises his hands, reddened with a King's own blood, and proclaims to the crowd,  ""See.  His blood is red just like ours.  You are your own masters now.""But England has been a monarchy for one thousand years and more.  The people are uncomfortable with concepts like 'freedom' and 'republic'.  They're even more uncomfortable with regicide.  Cromwell, despite his elevation to 'Lord Protector' is the most hated man in England.  Thomas, despite increasing dismay, sticks by the King but not for long.  The friendship breaks like a rotten stick.  Cromwell dies--some say by malaria--and the new English Republic dies along with him with the return of Charles II.  Charles strings the bones of Cromwell up for public display.  Thus with regicides.I think this is a very good movie.

Being of Irish descent I've surely heard the name ""Cromwell"" before!The problem is that we're never really sure who or what this film is about. Is it about Cromwell? Oliver Cromwell is rather pedestrainly played by Tim Roth. Is it about the English Civil war? Is it about General Fairfax and his firebrand wife? Is it about the last days of the Stuart Monarchy? It seems that the director goes down all of these roads a little way, only to stop and change horses before he gets very far. In the end we just get a muddled film that tries to tackle too much without really grounding us in character or plot.

When they are not quite up to snuff, they still transcend virtually any drama about American history of a similar period. Understandable to a degree since there was little ""royal"" intrigue (and even fewer beheadings) in our own early days. Indeed, except for ""1776"" and, maybe, ""Amistad"", few American history films are watchable. But I digress. ""To Kill a King"" falls below the best of Brit/hist dramas, but still has much to recommend it as more than just a history lesson. The performances are all fine with Rupert Everett a standout in the type of role he never gets in American films; the writing, if not much beyond serviceable, is never turgid or dull and keeps the various political complexities clear , and Mike Barker's direction moves things along at the right pace and maintains our interest throughout.

I occasionally watch the History Channel and read once in a while a history book, but try as I may, I can't recall reading about the few short years back during the 1600 hundreds when England was a republic. Thankfully, I had the chance to see `To Kill A King' and although the acting was not so great, I learned something new. As it turns out, there was a rebellion against the Stewards lead by Lord Fairfax and one Oliver Cromwell (not to be confused with the General sent to defeat the patriots during the civil war in the US colonies). According to the movie, the two men were friends at first, bound by a common vision, to bring justice and liberty from taxation to the people of England. Somewhere along the road, Lord Fairfax became doubtful in this quest. His wife helped him realize his lineage as one of those who were to protect the king. To make the long story short, Lord Fairfax wasn't able to do much for the king, who was publicly executed, but managed over the next several years to distance himself from Cromwell as a sign of disapproval for the bloodshed unleashed in the years after the rebellion. In the end, Cromwell died, Fairfax was gifted with a daughter and pardoned by the new price who returned from exile. England was never to become a republic again and I am sure I'll never see this movie again. My recommendation, skip this one and instead find a book detailing the account of this rebellion.

Basically you have a piece that is reflecting on a specific era in time and that reflection is well done. It earns the label drama, however, and it really wants to be epic in nature. That said, I would certainly say that were it not for Tim Roth I probably would have looked passed this movie because all in all, it was exactly what I expected. It had the set-up, the expected dress, the storyline - all of the things I anticipated just by reading about the movie. The one thing I did not expect was the not-so-run-of-the-mill acting that found its way into the movie.I was honestly surprised by that - not because I didn't expect a great performance from Roth but because many of these movies start to blur together in my mind after a while.With regard to a recommendation or not, it depends on how much the description appeals to you. If you want a piece set in a specific timeframe, have a love for these types of movies, and have some inkling of what you are getting into then I would say to try it out. I personally thought this was renting fodder and this isn't really a movie I would have considered if I were just browsing, but I'm not certain I would want it in a collection even if I really found all the descriptors exactly what I needed. Knowing what I know now I would probably rent it and see what I think about it before buying - it made for a good watch and was enjoyable but that alone does not make it an easy sale. For fans of Tim Roth this would be a great pick-up since Roth at the top of his game, and the genre might be appealing enough for people to go out and pick this up.All in all, I gave it a 3 because I liked it but didn't like it enough to say that it had the rewatchability I crave.",3,Roth at his finest,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,1824,"['breakdown', 'movie', 'not', 'really', 'needed', 'review', 'editorial', 'justice', 'Basically', 'have', 'piece', 'reflecting', 'specific', 'era', 'time', 'reflection', 'well', 'done', 'label', 'drama', 'however', 'really', 'be', 'epic', 'nature', 'said', 'would', 'certainly', 'say', 'were', 'not', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'passed', 'movie', 'was', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'had', 'set-up', 'expected', 'dress', 'storyline', 'things', 'anticipated', 'just', 'reading', 'movie', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'was', 'not-so-run-of-the-mill', 'acting', 'found', 'way', 'movie.I', 'was', 'honestly', 'surprised', 'not', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'performance', 'Roth', 'many', 'movies', 'start', 'blur', 'together', 'mind', 'while.With', 'regard', 'recommendation', 'not', 'how', 'much', 'description', 'appeals', 'want', 'piece', 'set', 'specific', 'timeframe', 'have', 'love', 'types', 'movies', 'have', 'inkling', 'what', 'are', 'getting', 'then', 'would', 'say', 'try', 'out', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'renting', 'fodder', ""n't"", 'really', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'considered', 'were', 'just', 'browsing', ""'m"", 'not', 'certain', 'would', 'want', 'collection', 'even', 'really', 'found', 'descriptors', 'exactly', 'what', 'needed', 'Knowing', 'what', 'know', 'now', 'would', 'probably', 'rent', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'buying', 'made', 'good', 'watch', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'alone', 'not', 'make', 'easy', 'sale', 'fans', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'pick-up', 'Roth', 'top', 'game', 'genre', 'might', 'be', 'appealing', 'enough', 'people', 'go', 'out', 'pick', 'up.All', 'gave', '3', 'liked', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'enough', 'say', 'had', 'rewatchability', 'crave']",N/A

However, it fails in presenting either a compelling plot or character development.  It felt at times as if the director was just trying to film a dramatization (a documentary) instead of actually pulling viewers into his tale.I understand that this film had budget problems.  However, money isn't the problem.  We didn't need to have bloody battle scenes to tell this story.  There was more than enough political intrigue to go around.  Most of it, unfortunately, seems to have been left in the history books and never made it into this film.  Some of the best films ever made are just about the development and evolution of characters without much emphasis on plot.  The characters in ""To Kill a King"" are just flat.The story of how the King of England was overthrown always interested me.  Not that I'm well read on the topic.  Rather, personally disliking the whole concept of a monarchy the story of Oliver Cromwell intrigued me.  But that's as far as it went.After watching this film I went and finally read up a little on the topic.

Then there was the fact that director Mike Barker's feature debut, the insultingly stupid The James Gang, was one of the very worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see. And that's ignoring Rupert Everett's efforts at promoting the movie in the States by describing it as boring rubbish and his performance being the only worthwhile thing in it.The omens weren't good, to put it mildly, but it actually turned out to be a surprisingly entertaining and ambitious retelling of the troubled relationship between Lord Fairfax and his deputy Oliver Cromwell in the aftermath of the English Civil War. I can't vouch for its historical accuracy (widely criticized in the UK), but as drama it works very well, despite the fact that Roth's Cromwell isn't at the top of his game while Scott lacks the voice for the rabble-rousing speeches (although he's much better here than his usual lacklustre screen performances).It's well-directed and hides the budget problems that saw the picture shut down for a few weeks while they scrambled for money to finish the picture quite admirably. It has a sense of scale both in story and treatment and, though it loses momentum slightly after the king's death, it deserved to find the audience it was denied in cinemas.

This one in particular is not on the top of my list, but nonetheless worth the watch if you're hungry to know more about England's past. Charles I, appointed by God to be King over England, etc. (reminded me of The Tudors and Henry VIII reiterating a thousand times it was God who put him on the throne), nonetheless met the block and was beheaded.  Oliver Cromwell, supposedly freed the people from their tyrannical king, but was portrayed as a tyrant himself with a king-hungry drive to rule the nation.  The portrayal of Fairfax, who pits himself against Oliver's decisions, turned out to be an interesting affair between two men.  Frankly, I expected him to lose his head at any moment.  However, from what I've read, the real-life ending was not as nice as portrayed in the movie, but one of horrendous argument between the two before Cromwell died.The acting was fair; not over the top.  The scenery reminiscent of my last trip to London on 2011 when I was at Hampton Court, where a large majority of the scenes were shot.
