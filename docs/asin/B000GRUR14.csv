1006709,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000GRUR14,Anton Ilinski,"[7, 9]","Seems like we've seen it all already - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, Wrong Turn and Wolf Creek... So any new movie based on these peripetias has to offer something new not to look boring and secondary. Surely modern directors saw the same movies we all saw and they know as well of a horror tradition and of what they should do or shouldn't considering their projects. And here hides all the charm of Fabrice Du Welz's ""The Ordeal"" originally named ""Calvaire"". It seems that Du Welz consciously decided not to take into consideration previous horror-movies' experience, he took it as a tabula rasa to create something new as if there were nothing created before, pretending he's a kind of a pioneer. And surprisingly he succeeded.""The Ordeal"" turned out to be rather quiet and modest film and maybe that's where its fascination comes from. It appears you can make one truly disturbing picture without crushed skulls and sawed off limbs. On celluloid Du Welz created his little, personal hell, which sometimes may seem more infernal than those of Romero, Hooper and Argento combined.There's no need to retell the story - it's the same old one: a man, whose car brakes, finds himself in a place no one would want to make into, and meets people no one would want to encounter either. The trick is there are no mutants here, no rivers of blood and no nervous chasings through the woods. Everyting is very calm and routine. And that makes your skin creep. We got used to mindblowing adventures of those who got into trouble including the above-mentioned chasings with all kinds of cold arms. Not this time. The place Du Welz created is totally real, I'm sure you all saw these places, these desolate villages where few people live. And these people are not mutants, not some kind of maniacs degenerated after years of inbreeding. They are normal rural inhabitants who've been changed slightly because of the lack of communication and love maybe. The horror of the situation is that you never know when you're going to meet these people travelling by car next time. They are not in a desert and not in some solitude with no one around for hundreds of miles. They may be couple of miles from your home. Remember this is not US or Australia, it's Belgium you can spend half a day crossing in a car. If previous similar horror movies' message was - don't go too far from your home, you may find trouble, ""The Ordeal"" tells you - don't leave your house at all!In general all that's happening in the village doesn't look like some crazy and gory nightmare, it's so real and humdrum you will be shocked. It's an ""everyday nightmare"", a personal Calvary that maybe every man has to experience once with an outcome unknown. The matter is you don't know when and where. The title ""The Ordeal"" pretty well conveys this idea albeit ""Calvair"" is much more philosophical and closer to the meaning of the film.I'd like to mention also the great Belgian exteriors which add some terrifying coloration to the picture and make it truly dark and ominous. At this point ""The Ordeal"" is one of the most beautiful and dire movies I've seen. Besides you'd be glad (I guess) to meet some of the people you know - Philippe Nahon from ""Haute tension"" and ""I Stand Alone"", horror and erotic icon Brigitte Lahaie and I must mention the director of photography Benot Debie who shot ""Irreversible"". Anyway ""The Ordeal"" is a nice addition to the genre, I'm not sorry I bought it.",4,CALVARY,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,3451,"['Seems', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'already', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'Deliverance', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'So', 'new', 'movie', 'based', 'peripetias', 'offer', 'something', 'new', 'not', 'look', 'boring', 'secondary', 'Surely', 'modern', 'directors', 'saw', 'same', 'movies', 'saw', 'know', 'as', 'well', 'horror', 'tradition', 'what', 'should', 'do', 'should', ""n't"", 'considering', 'projects', 'here', 'charm', 'Fabrice', 'Du', 'Welz', 'Ordeal', 'originally', 'named', 'Calvaire', 'Du', 'Welz', 'consciously', 'decided', 'not', 'take', 'consideration', 'previous', 'horror-movies', 'experience', 'took', 'tabula', 'rasa', 'create', 'something', 'new', 'were', 'nothing', 'created', 'pretending', 'kind', 'pioneer', 'surprisingly', 'succeeded', 'Ordeal', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'rather', 'quiet', 'modest', 'film', 'maybe', 'where', 'fascination', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'picture', 'crushed', 'skulls', 'sawed', 'off', 'limbs', 'celluloid', 'Du', 'Welz', 'created', 'little', 'personal', 'hell', 'sometimes', 'may', 'seem', 'more', 'infernal', 'Romero', 'Hooper', 'Argento', 'need', 'retell', 'story', 'same', 'old', 'one', 'man', 'car', 'brakes', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'meets', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'encounter', 'either', 'trick', 'are', 'mutants', 'here', 'rivers', 'blood', 'nervous', 'chasings', 'woods', 'Everyting', 'very', 'calm', 'routine', 'skin', 'creep', 'got', 'used', 'mindblowing', 'adventures', 'who', 'got', 'trouble', 'including', 'above-mentioned', 'chasings', 'kinds', 'cold', 'arms', 'Not', 'time', 'place', 'Du', 'Welz', 'created', 'totally', 'real', ""'m"", 'sure', 'saw', 'places', 'desolate', 'villages', 'where', 'few', 'people', 'live', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'mutants', 'not', 'kind', 'maniacs', 'degenerated', 'years', 'inbreeding', 'are', 'normal', 'rural', 'inhabitants', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'changed', 'slightly', 'lack', 'communication', 'love', 'maybe', 'horror', 'situation', 'never', 'know', 'when', ""'re"", 'going', 'meet', 'people', 'travelling', 'car', 'next', 'time', 'are', 'not', 'desert', 'not', 'solitude', 'one', 'around', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'may', 'be', 'couple', 'miles', 'home', 'Remember', 'not', 'US', 'Australia', 'Belgium', 'can', 'spend', 'day', 'crossing', 'car', 'previous', 'similar', 'horror', 'movies', 'message', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'home', 'may', 'find', 'trouble', 'Ordeal', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'house', 'general', 'happening', 'village', ""n't"", 'look', 'crazy', 'gory', 'nightmare', 'so', 'real', 'humdrum', 'will', 'be', 'shocked', 'everyday', 'nightmare', 'personal', 'Calvary', 'maybe', 'man', 'experience', 'once', 'outcome', 'unknown', 'matter', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'where', 'title', 'Ordeal', 'pretty', 'well', 'conveys', 'idea', 'Calvair', 'much', 'more', 'philosophical', 'closer', 'meaning', 'film.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'mention', 'also', 'great', 'Belgian', 'exteriors', 'add', 'terrifying', 'coloration', 'picture', 'make', 'truly', 'dark', 'ominous', 'point', 'Ordeal', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'dire', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'d"", 'be', 'glad', 'guess', 'meet', 'people', 'know', 'Philippe', 'Nahon', 'Haute', 'tension', 'Stand', 'Alone', 'horror', 'erotic', 'icon', 'Brigitte', 'Lahaie', 'must', 'mention', 'director', 'photography', 'Benot', 'Debie', 'who', 'shot', 'Irreversible', 'Anyway', 'Ordeal', 'nice', 'addition', 'genre', ""'m"", 'not', 'sorry', 'bought']",Calvaire: The Ordeal

It's always nice to see that foreigners have their own type of hillbillies, eh?Marc Stevens sings at old peoples homes. Hes driving to an audition which might be his big break when, o snap, his car breaks down. The hotel owner, Bartel, has not had many visitors since something or the other happened. (We are honestly just as confused as Marc is during this movie about the WHYs and WHATs). Next thing you know Bartel is putting Marc into a dress and starts referring to him as Gloria.  And then things get weird.My favorite scenes: Marc has been confused and crying for awhile. In one last show of frustration and courage, he proclaims, I AM NOT GLORIA; I AM MARC STEVENS. To no avail, of course. Seeing the desperation and frustration of Marc's psychology at that time really touched me.Also, forget about the bestiality - one of the creepier parts of the movie is when we see Bartel spooning Marc. Im cringing just typing it.Another great moment from this movie was Marc interacting with one of the bad townspeople while he was in the forest (towards the end; I just dont want to spoil it for anyone!).This movie is not everyone's cup of tea.  You might think its too slow, too graphic, not graphic enough, no plot, not good, not cohesive and the list goes on.  Anyways, Youtube the bar dance scene.

1006714,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000GRUR14,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[24, 29]","Disturbing; unsettling, weird; uncomfortable - these are just a few of the adjectives that most come to mind when I reflect upon this uniquely creepy film.  The English title is The Ordeal, but ordeal really isn't an adequate description of what this film's protagonist endures over the course of this 90-minute film.  I looked ""Calvaire"" up online and found that it translates from French to English as martyrdom or living death - yep, that's pretty much spot on, as I think all viewers of this film will agree.  I like my horror as deep and disturbing as I can find it, yet I've never developed a real affinity for exploitation films or for the types of films that admittedly influenced Belgian director Fabrice Du Welz (including the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and I don't believe anyone, (including this film's biggest fans) can say they actually enjoyed this cinematic experience - yet there's something special and certainly compelling about Calvaire.  Even though I didn't interpret it exactly the way the director explains it, it's a darn impressive film that succeeds amazingly well at shocking and disturbing the viewer.For a director's first feature-length movie - and one that that makes no secret of that director's cinematic influences - Calvaire achieves a sustained identity all its own, evincing a shrouded, unsettling cinematic atmosphere from the opening shot.  It's most interesting to hear Du Welz talk about his cinematic vision and the film's intended transitions from naturalism to surrealism and back.  I do have a problem with the way snow appears and disappears from the landscape (as well as the treatment of a couple of animal actors), but apart from that the cinematography is ruthlessly effective.Calvaire asks ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and then sets about to answer that question rather definitively.  Lounge singer Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas) already lives in a depressing, colorless world, with a couple of rather disturbing events hastening him away from his latest gig performing at a retirement home.  On the way to his next appearance, he takes to unfamiliar backcountry roads, leaving him high but not at all dry when his van breaks down in the middle of nowhere - at night - in a rainstorm.  An obviously mentally challenged stranger out looking for his dog directs him to a rural inn just up the road.  Upon Marc's arrival, the proprietor of that establishment, Bartel (Jackie Berroyer), seems nice enough, taking him in and volunteering to work on his van.  He does a number on the van, all right, but not before revealing his obvious state of mental anguish over his wife Gloria's desertion of him.  Bartel really, really wants his wife back.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  Gloria's gone, Marc's there.  Gloria was a singer, Marc is a singer.  I think you can imagine just what kind of dire situation Marc soon finds himself in.As if things weren't bad enough for Marc already, the local villagers are also interested in ""Gloria"" - and they are even stranger than Bartel, as they prove during the oddest dancing scene I've ever seen in my life.  From this point on, all bets are off in terms of what will happen - the only guarantee is that it will be memorable and increasingly disturbing.  The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but by that point you're so knocked off-kilter that you don't really know how to react, anyway.The making-of featurette, which consists of a lengthy interview with the director and some behind-the-scenes shots of key scenes, is extremely interesting.  Du Welz's enthusiasm is contagious, and it's refreshing to hear him acknowledge his influences while detailing his peculiar vision for this film.  It was here that I discovered that he carefully chose his actors in order to put a unique spin on the story, but my unfamiliarity with Jackie Berroyer in particular led me to interpret the story quite differently.  (Among the cast members, I should note, is Brigitte Lahaie in a small cameo role.)  Thus, I now have two different ways of looking at this film.  You just don't find that kind of depth in the vast majority of studio films, and the same thing can be said of the daring of Du Welz, Berroyer, and - in particular - Laurent.  If you're looking for something different, this is it.  You may not enjoy Calvaire, but you can't help but be impressed by it.",4,"An unforgettably dark, disturbing, uniquely fascinating film",1159056000,"09 24, 2006",2006,4365,"['Disturbing', 'unsettling', 'weird', 'uncomfortable', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'adjectives', 'most', 'come', 'mind', 'when', 'reflect', 'uniquely', 'creepy', 'film', 'English', 'title', 'Ordeal', 'ordeal', 'really', ""n't"", 'adequate', 'description', 'what', 'film', 'protagonist', 'course', '90-minute', 'film', 'looked', 'Calvaire', 'up', 'online', 'found', 'French', 'English', 'martyrdom', 'living', 'death', 'yep', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot', 'think', 'viewers', 'film', 'will', 'agree', 'horror', 'deep', 'disturbing', 'can', 'find', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'never', 'developed', 'real', 'affinity', 'exploitation', 'films', 'types', 'films', 'admittedly', 'influenced', 'Belgian', 'director', 'Fabrice', 'Du', 'Welz', 'including', 'original', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'anyone', 'including', 'film', 'biggest', 'fans', 'can', 'say', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'yet', 'something', 'special', 'certainly', 'compelling', 'Calvaire', 'Even', 'did', ""n't"", 'interpret', 'exactly', 'way', 'director', 'darn', 'impressive', 'film', 'amazingly', 'well', 'shocking', 'disturbing', 'viewer.For', 'director', 'first', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'one', 'secret', 'director', 'cinematic', 'influences', 'Calvaire', 'sustained', 'identity', 'own', 'evincing', 'shrouded', 'unsettling', 'cinematic', 'atmosphere', 'opening', 'shot', 'most', 'interesting', 'hear', 'Du', 'Welz', 'talk', 'cinematic', 'vision', 'film', 'intended', 'transitions', 'naturalism', 'surrealism', 'back', 'do', 'have', 'problem', 'way', 'snow', 'landscape', 'as', 'well', 'treatment', 'couple', 'animal', 'actors', 'apart', 'cinematography', 'ruthlessly', 'effective.Calvaire', 'What', 'worst', 'could', 'happen', 'then', 'sets', 'answer', 'question', 'rather', 'definitively', 'Lounge', 'singer', 'Marc', 'Stevens', 'Laurent', 'Lucas', 'already', 'depressing', 'colorless', 'world', 'couple', 'rather', 'disturbing', 'events', 'hastening', 'away', 'latest', 'gig', 'performing', 'retirement', 'home', 'way', 'next', 'appearance', 'unfamiliar', 'backcountry', 'roads', 'leaving', 'high', 'not', 'dry', 'when', 'van', 'breaks', 'down', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'night', 'rainstorm', 'obviously', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'stranger', 'out', 'looking', 'dog', 'rural', 'inn', 'just', 'road', 'Marc', 'arrival', 'proprietor', 'establishment', 'Bartel', 'Jackie', 'Berroyer', 'nice', 'enough', 'taking', 'volunteering', 'work', 'van', 'number', 'van', 'right', 'not', 'revealing', 'obvious', 'state', 'mental', 'anguish', 'wife', 'Gloria', 'desertion', 'Bartel', 'really', 'really', 'wife', 'back', 'Do', 'see', 'where', ""'m"", 'going', 'Gloria', 'gone', 'Marc', 'there', 'Gloria', 'was', 'singer', 'Marc', 'singer', 'think', 'can', 'imagine', 'just', 'what', 'kind', 'dire', 'situation', 'Marc', 'soon', 'in.As', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Marc', 'already', 'local', 'villagers', 'are', 'also', 'interested', 'Gloria', 'are', 'even', 'stranger', 'Bartel', 'prove', 'oddest', 'dancing', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'point', 'bets', 'are', 'terms', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'only', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'memorable', 'increasingly', 'disturbing', 'ending', 'somewhat', 'ambiguous', 'point', ""'re"", 'so', 'knocked', 'off-kilter', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'how', 'react', 'anyway.The', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'lengthy', 'interview', 'director', 'behind-the-scenes', 'shots', 'key', 'scenes', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'Du', 'Welz', 'enthusiasm', 'contagious', 'refreshing', 'hear', 'acknowledge', 'influences', 'detailing', 'peculiar', 'vision', 'film', 'was', 'here', 'discovered', 'carefully', 'chose', 'actors', 'order', 'put', 'unique', 'spin', 'story', 'unfamiliarity', 'Jackie', 'Berroyer', 'particular', 'led', 'interpret', 'story', 'quite', 'differently', 'cast', 'members', 'should', 'note', 'Brigitte', 'Lahaie', 'small', 'cameo', 'role', 'Thus', 'now', 'have', 'two', 'different', 'ways', 'looking', 'film', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'kind', 'depth', 'vast', 'majority', 'studio', 'films', 'same', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'daring', 'Du', 'Welz', 'Berroyer', 'particular', 'Laurent', ""'re"", 'looking', 'something', 'different', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'Calvaire', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed']",Calvaire: The Ordeal

Calvaire is not just about the horror of all that can go wrong on a person's worst day - and when nowhere near civilization, it is about the staggering desolation and spiritual destitution of being broken by a psychopath with no hope of getting help from the outside world and at the same time being physically disabled by your tormentor . The scene with Marc, Boris and Bartel at the Kitchen table - shot with a 360 degree panorama that induces vertigo - is a psychoscopic peak into the madness that surrounds Marc and is close to ensconcing him completely, if only he can escape . Calvaire, not for the weak or easily intimidated but like all good horror movies from France & Belgium is definetly worth seeing .",3,Le Calvaire . . . an ordeal indeed,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",2009,745,"['ordeal', 'certainly', 'Calvaire', 'not', 'just', 'horror', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'person', 'worst', 'day', 'when', 'nowhere', 'civilization', 'staggering', 'desolation', 'spiritual', 'destitution', 'being', 'broken', 'psychopath', 'hope', 'getting', 'help', 'outside', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'physically', 'disabled', 'tormentor', 'scene', 'Marc', 'Boris', 'Bartel', 'Kitchen', 'table', 'shot', '360', 'degree', 'panorama', 'vertigo', 'psychoscopic', 'peak', 'madness', 'Marc', 'close', 'ensconcing', 'completely', 'only', 'can', 'escape', 'Calvaire', 'not', 'weak', 'easily', 'intimidated', 'good', 'horror', 'movies', 'France', 'Belgium', 'definetly', 'worth', 'seeing']",Calvaire: The Ordeal

The cinematography is lush and the feeling of desolation that the prevades the film is ever-present. However, the film just makes no sense. Some films are supposed to puzzle people for a reason so they can come to thier own conclusions, but Calvaire just made me scratch my head.SPOILERSFirst off, I can understand the character of Bartel alone being crazy and delusional about thinking that Marc is his ex wife, but how is it that the crazy villagers share the same fantasy? How can a whole group of people have the same delusions? Is there something in the water? There is a lot of talk in the film, which is great for character development, but unfortunatley there really is none in Calvaire. You dont get any background info on the perverted villagers who assault Marc. The only thing you learn in the end is that the villagers are more sick and twisted than Bartel. Other than a minor shoot-out scene which is over with pretty quick, there really isnt much going on in the film other than Marc being tormented. The Deliverance element(you guys know what I am talking about) only last a second and isnt dwelled upon. There is, however, a quick scene of implied beastiality that really helps the viewer understand how insane the villagers really are. The ending is sudden and gives no clue to the viewer whether Marc makes it out alive or not.  Bottom line is that Calvaire is a very well-crafted film, but what good is lush cinematography and atmosphere without a well-developed story and some action.

Fabrice du Welz has taken a rather familiar horror movie scenario and twisted it around with dazzlingly different results.  He pursues the logic of the plot developments to a really memorable and, for me, devastatingly numbing and beautiful ending. I don't recommend this for sensitive souls who can't stomach cinematic depictions of brutality or distress (you know who you are) and I don't recommend this for people who like to watch brutality but who don't want to think about it (you know who you are).  Don't watch and fixate on the probability or likelihood of certain of the events happening; this movie is not meant to be a realistic rendering of the behavior of sensible people.  The strength of the narrative is following through in a dreamlike or poetic way on the philosophical underpinnings of a strange but undeniable dynamic of desire: how value winds up getting displaced from object to object irrationally through a network of wanting lustful subjects, and how damaging that transfer can be for those involved, both the desirer and the desired.

What I found to be good in this film was the acting, sets and music.The acting is top notch from all sources here. What I found interesting was that the only two female characters were in the very beginning. The rest of the movie was strictly male characters, with references made to a 'Gloria'.The sets/location were superb to the story. Dark woods, winter, rainy... all lend itself well to a stark, barren landscape which is perfect for the sense of being trapped that the main character endures.Very littel trick photography, which works well. And very little music to speak of. Scenes that were tense were left without background music which added to the cold, starkness of the plot.What I didn't like is that the plot borrows, strongly, from other sources.

1006721,A2V9G4DCMBFVHV,B000GRUR14,KFavors,"[0, 0]","The film tip-toes the line between being gory and suspenseful. The plot is simple: a traveling C-list singer is making his rounds from nursing home to nursing home performing for the holidays. He takes a back road during a heavy storm (clich&eacute;, yes, we know) and wrecks his vehicle. He runs into a random character looking for his dog Bella in the woods---as Bella has run away---and the protagonist asks the man for help. He agrees and both men make their way to a private, secluded bed-n-breakfast. The owner of the establishment appears nice and hospitable initially but as the film continues, the viewers learn he's actually quite unstable. That's as much as I can give without giving away the entire storyline.The scenes occurred in the nursing home, the woods, the bed and breakfast and one bar in a little town nearby. I liked this setup (versus a thousand different locations) because it created a sense of intimacy and pulled me in: I felt like I was there. I think the director selected this format so that the characters could build close relationships before the s*** hit the fan. The ongoing tension between the singer and the hostel owner erupted in several rooms throughout the house: solidifying the protagonist's sense of being trapped both physically and emotionally as he tries to rationalize what's going on around him.I thought the film was beautifully written: it pulls at the human psyche and forces you to question what is exactly &#34;sane&#34; and what isn't. There were no monsters, no ghosts, no &#34;demons&#34;, no lost footage: just the darkest parts of the human mind. During the entire film, I asked myself, &#34; how does one eventually figure out they're mentally unstable? And how does this instability manifest in their interactions with others.&#34; It was very apparent about 40 minutes in that the bed&breakfast; owner was sadistic and disturbed but he clearly thought his behavior was perfectly normal. There were several moments throughout the movie that could be considered &#34;black comedy&#34; or &#34;Dark comedy&#34;; you want to laugh but only because you're uncomfortable.

Instead, this film resonates in more creepy and psychological ways.  There are scenes that will stay with you and they are not graphically violent but deeply violent all the same.  The extremely disturbing dancing scene of the villagers and the pig squeals still haunt me.As already noted, it is a tale about all the things that can go wrong once you leave your own protected environment.  There is a reason why the backwoods are so scary (shades ofDeliverance, French style).  This movie is scary and the characters are among the creepiest.  Bartel, the inn keeper, and the villagers are a freak show!  Certain scenes were hard to watch.  The cinematography was breathtaking and eerie all at once.  Other scenes are left to the viewers imagination which can make things all the more chilling.As a viewer, I was dying to know about the back drop of this story and the extras on this dvd did not help me.  Obviously, there are no females in this remote village.  How did this come to pass?  Were the men a little off to begin with? or were they driven to this primal state by the lack of women?  This factor is what drives The Ordeal of Marc Stevens.  Why would Bartel have stayed with his wife in this village in the first place? It becomes clearer when Bartel confides that the villagers were not like him and Mr. Stevens.  While this warns Mr. Stevens away from the villagers it also, we later discover, makes a very fine distinction between degrees of crazy.  Very interesting movie.Some believe this movie is about zombies but I would disagree. I think it's really a movie arguing the natural state of man.  To paraphrase the great French philosopher Rousseau, the progression of the sciences and arts caused the corruption of virtue and morality in society.  The consequences of this Village following  Rousseau's ""Social Contract"" which recommended the return to nature and the whole ""Naturalism"" movement are horrific.  The religious overtones (the whole nailing to the cross bit and following baser instincts leads to bad things) and shades ofLord of the Flies(what is the basic nature of man?) and plenty of other references all add up to a fascinating film not to be missed.

They are:(A) A car battery is heavy.  If a weak, old man is standing in front of you trying to lift a car battery high enough to hit you in the head with it, you can EASILY avoid it.  This is precisely why the actual battery-to-head contact is not shown on-camera.  Because it would look ridiculous.(B) Marc is shown to be a normal human being.  Why does he IMMEDIATELY revert to a simpering, powerless child the second he is hit with a car battery and tied up?  All he does the rest of the movie is lie around passively and cry!  I'm not saying it doesn't HURT to get hit in the head by a car battery, and perhaps what I'm missing is that maybe the injury scrambled his brain so much that he can't think clearly enough to fight back against his oppresser.

Attractive, but no great beauty, he has virtually no personality.  Even so, everyone in the film seems to fancy him.  One old lady comes on to Marc in a surprisingly direct manner after his show.  Then the director shamelessly throws herself at him, thoughtfully including erotic pictures of herself in his pay packet.  Alas, he is impervious to their respective charms.Marc's van breaks down ""in the middle of nowhere"" which is  a stretch of the imagination as he is in Belgium, not Appalachia.  He has issues, to be sure -- like a ""low-key"" disposition verging on depression --  but everyone else in the film is downright loony.  The inn-keeper, where Marc is the only guest, is ""crazy""  about him.  Get in line, buddy!  The older man seems amiable enough at first, but soon reveals a darker side.  Among his more conventional designs on the hapless boy are a very bad haircut and a dress.Aside from the two ladies at the home, there isn't another female in sight.  Just a bar full of inbred cretins whose fitful dancing suggests Night of the Living Dead and the Monster Mash. And guess what?!  They all want a shot at Marc, who they call Gloria (the town slut who infuriated everyone by running off at the first opportunity).  The only guy not drooling over Marc/Gloria has a significant other of sorts: a pig on a leash which figured prominently in an earlier love scene.The dialogue dwindles down, after the first twenty minutes, to a lot of squealing from the pig, whimpering and crying from the adults. The non-linguistic din may be intended as a subtle hint that these simpletons are like animals, but to make that comparison is a categorical insult to critters everywhere.After his ordeal, one might reasonably wonder if Marc could possibly return to singing his insipid songs at the old-age home again.

I'm glad I did, for Calvaire, while not exactly your basic horror film, is very, very good at what it does.It's the story of Marc Stevens (Dans ma Peau's Laurent Lucas), a washed-up singer who's reduced to taking his lounge-lizard act (which I swear is modeled on the final episode of Are You Being Served?) to old-age homes. (The opening sequence has a great cameo with seventies softcore superstar Brigitte Lahaie, if that sort of thing interests you.) On his way between two gigs, his van breaks down, and he is led by a mentally challenged young man named Boris (Jean-Luc Couchard) to an inn owned by one M. Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). Bartel promises to fix Stevens' van right up and get him on his way, but Stevens can't shake the idea that there's something just plain weird about the whole setup...As a horror movie, it's pretty bland. I'll say that right up front. There's very little gore, there are no jump moments, there's not even all that much atmosphere. Things happen, we see them, that's it. As a surreal comedy, on the other hand, it's absolutely brilliant. (If you have any doubt that this movie is intended as a comedy, it will be quashed when you see the dance in the bar.) It is not, however, a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy; it's the kind of thing that you snicker behind you hand at, then immediately feel guilty for doing so. Du Welz (and it's very hard for me to believe this is his first feature film) keeps things just slightly off-kilter at all times, veering wildly every now and then to keep the viewer nauseated at all times (in a metaphysical sense; we're not talking about Noe's camerawork in Irreversible here). It gets to the point where you just can't believe that someone thought this stuff up. And while I saw the big twist/punchline coming a mile off, it's one of those ""I can't believe he'll really go there"" moments whose predictability doesn't diminish the pleasurable shock of it one jot (like the immortal final scene of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer).I know I'm in the minority on this, but I loved Calvaire, and recommend it without hesitation. Just don't go in expecting something like Wolf Creek, and you'll be fine. ****",4,A very pleasant surprise.,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,2399,"['Calvaire', 'Fabrice', 'du', 'Welz', '2004', 'France', ""n't"", 'made', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'decades', 'ever', 'thus', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'was', 'interested', 'Calvaire', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'something', 'resolved', ""'d"", 'give', 'shot', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Calvaire', 'not', 'exactly', 'basic', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'does.It', 'story', 'Marc', 'Stevens', 'Dans', 'ma', 'Peau', 'Laurent', 'Lucas', 'washed-up', 'singer', 'who', 'reduced', 'taking', 'lounge-lizard', 'act', 'swear', 'modeled', 'final', 'episode', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'old-age', 'homes', 'opening', 'sequence', 'great', 'cameo', 'seventies', 'softcore', 'superstar', 'Brigitte', 'Lahaie', 'sort', 'thing', 'interests', 'way', 'two', 'gigs', 'van', 'breaks', 'down', 'led', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Boris', 'Jean-Luc', 'Couchard', 'inn', 'owned', 'one', 'M.', 'Bartel', 'Jackie', 'Berroyer', 'Bartel', 'fix', 'Stevens', 'van', 'right', 'up', 'get', 'way', 'Stevens', 'ca', ""n't"", 'shake', 'idea', 'something', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'whole', 'setup', 'horror', 'movie', 'pretty', 'bland', ""'ll"", 'say', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'very', 'little', 'gore', 'are', 'jump', 'moments', 'not', 'even', 'that', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'Things', 'happen', 'see', 'surreal', 'comedy', 'other', 'hand', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'have', 'doubt', 'movie', 'intended', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'quashed', 'when', 'see', 'dance', 'bar', 'not', 'however', 'laugh-out-loud', 'kind', 'comedy', 'kind', 'thing', 'snicker', 'hand', 'then', 'immediately', 'feel', 'guilty', 'doing', 'so', 'Du', 'Welz', 'very', 'hard', 'believe', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'things', 'just', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'times', 'veering', 'wildly', 'now', 'then', 'keep', 'viewer', 'nauseated', 'times', 'metaphysical', 'sense', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'Noe', 'camerawork', 'Irreversible', 'here', 'point', 'where', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'someone', 'thought', 'stuff', 'up', 'saw', 'big', 'twist/punchline', 'coming', 'mile', 'off', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'ll"", 'really', 'go', 'there', 'moments', 'predictability', ""n't"", 'diminish', 'pleasurable', 'shock', 'one', 'jot', 'immortal', 'final', 'scene', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', '.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'minority', 'loved', 'Calvaire', 'recommend', 'hesitation', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'Wolf', 'Creek', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', '****']",Calvaire: The Ordeal

1006730,A3TDJYEQCXG1DA,B000GRUR14,Sera69,"[3, 7]","This film pulls its punches at every opportunity.The violence is off screen. The terror is implied; the gore minimal, the horror non-existent. Tension is sought only through the use of a long and boring introduction: It's almost 50 minutes before anything happens. I assume this is supposed to offset the mundane against ""The Ordeal"" to come. It doesn't.The characters are one dimensional. The hero is a whining wimp who has plenty of opportunity to escape. The psycho hotelier is never anything but warm and friendly. And he remains amiable and quite likeable for the duration. There is nothing frightening about him at all. There is no subtle change from good guy to bad. There is no glimmer of the psychopath, no sign of suppressed rage: nothing freaky whatsoever. Apparently this is what the director wanted, some kind of sympathetic psychopath, but it just makes the rest of what happens in the film more confusing, ridiculous and stupid. The villagers are almost an afterthought, remembered only for their dancing.And the much vaunted surrealism is just misplaced and evokes only derision in the viewer not intrigue.The plot is thin, with enough holes to confuse even a casual observer. The acting, although adequate is let down by some poor prop & continuity work. Our hero is knocked unconscious by the innkeeper swinging a car battery at him; difficult to believe at best. Ropes are too loosely tied, muddy fields become snow covered become muddy fields again. That the deluded innkeeper believes the male cabaret artist to be his long lost wife is acceptable; that the village leader also shares the delusion is laughable.In fact, only the bleakly shot countryside comes out of this with any dignity. And even then, you'll be thinking 'nice holiday destination' rather than 'Oo scary.'I'm harsh on this film because it had the potential to be something very special. It could have done for rural France/Belgium what Deliverance and Southern Comfort did for the backwoods of the Deep South. It could have been a Misery or Psycho. Unfortunately it's a sloppily handled lame joke of a film. Indeed, Tartan could find themselves on the wrong side of a lawsuit for this release: Terror?

1006731,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000GRUR14,Terry Mesnard,"[8, 11]","Wow, where do I start.  I stumbled upon Calvaire with Netflix, after it recommended the film to me (usually a good sign).  Then, I read reviews and the synopsis, all of which seemed to suggest it was like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Finally, knowing it was a foreign horror film, I decided to give it a go since I am usually not burned with foreign horror films.Calvaire is about a musical performer named Marc Stevens who is apparently quite the stud and is hit upon by an old woman and a young woman.  He must have some animal magnetism that attracts anyone and everyone to him, which becomes problematic when he runs afoul of a town of sex-starved men, it seems.  But I'm getting way ahead of myself.  Marc leaves (much to the chagrin of his two forlorn wannabe lovers) to do another performance in another town.  While en route, his car breaks down but he learns of an inn nearby.  Luckily, the inn keeper can get his car fixed, but his interest in Marc seems to turn towards the infatuation side of things.Long story short, Marc is seen as the inn keeper's former wife, he gets tied to a chair and the rest of the movie documents his passive cries as he endures all sorts of torture.  But that makes it sound more thrilling than it actually is.  Some people have called the film ""disturbing,"" a term that I believe gets bandied about way too much.  And while I did sit through the film with my eyebrow arched more often than not, it was more because I couldn't believe I was actually sitting through the film and seeing what I was seeing.Marc turns from a normal, mentally strong person to a whimpering (and poorly acted) man in a dress in a matter of minutes.  From there on, my suspension of disbelief fled the scene, probably to elope with any semblance of a plot.  Further arching my brow (could it get any higher on my forehead, I wondered?) was a sequence in which the village people (no, not the band, but the crazy town folk), who are all male, it seems, all simultaneously stand up and dance with each other.  Well, if you can call it dancing; they instead step from one foot to the other while staring intently and deeply into each other's eyes.  What the heck am I watching?Misinterpreted love is a common theme in horror movies and when it works, it's superb.  But Calvaire wholey stretched my believability to the point that I had to see the whole thing, just hoping it'd get better.  Hint: It doesn't.  I love horror movies.  I love the so-called disturbing and psychological films, as well.  Calvaire is a psychological study, for sure.

You're lost in the woods and the night is closing in. This Belgian film asks you: ""What is the worst that could happen?"" You can find the answer in `Calvaire,' but its answer is not what you see in Hollywood horror films.The worst happens to a young and handsome chansons singer Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas). After his car's breakdown, he walks to the nearest village, guided by a young man he encountered on the way. The boy says he is searching his dog, but he behaves a little strange. Is he afraid of something?After arriving at the village, an old man named Bartel (Jackie Berroyer) kindly lets Marc stay at his house. Believing that he can continue his travel, Marc thanks him for his kind offer, and accepts it. But Bartel seems to have his own plan. In fact, the old man thinks that he knows about Marc, or someone named Gloria, and it turns out that Marc has to stay there much longer than he expected.[BIZARRE] It is certain, as the story unfolds, that there is something wrong with the people there, I mean, all the people in this film except Marc. The film is filled with this creepy mood from the beginning, even before his getting lost in woods. In the first scene Marc's karaoke gig ends with two elderly females eagerly staring at him, and one of them gives him a collection of disturbing Polaroid photos. Marc may be called an objct of desire, but he is the last person to know that.`Calvaire' has another title `The Ordeal' which many be a more appropriate one for Marc, who must endure so much. I should not reveal the film's story here. That's because I know doing so would be pointless, but still I can tell you that you don't see a blood-stained chainsaw or a masked killer. What you see instead is the world of insanity, an isolated community where insanity slowly creeps in a stealthy way toward Marc.Why do these Belgian country boys act like that? (There is one quite original dancing scene in which the villagers dance to the unnerving sound of pounding piano like zombies.) What is the reason behind the enmity between them and the old Bartel? Answers are suggested, but not completely given.Belgian director Fabrice Du Welz's `Calvaire' is a film that defies our easy categorization. It is a horror, but shocks come very slowly; violence is also there (though graphic descriptions are avoided), but the film has some dark humor. It most definitely reminds us of countless films in the past, horror or otherwise, but the film is hardly an imitation of them. It also has underlying religious tone, but it is hard to pinpoint the exact meaning of it.Whatever the film is, the film's photography capturing the bleak rural landscape is something you should not miss (by a cinematographer Benot Debie, known for Gaspar No&eacute;'s more depressing `Irr&eacute;versible'). It is breathtakingly beautiful and sinister-looking at the same time, something that you seldom see.If you want to see something original, strange, or bizarre; if you think you have seen everything, try this one. `Calvaire' is a film you either love or hate. Some images still remain in my mind as well as the crying of a pig that is still haunting.",4,"""What is the worst that could happen if You're Lost in the Woods?""

Aside from a regrettable ""homage"" to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (in which a wonderfully-controlled performance takes a disppointing, cliche'ed turn)and a poorly-executed death scene near the end, this had me mesmerised and often on the edge of my seat. Great atmosphere of tension and unanswered questions. The implausible ""landscape"" is effective and fits the story. The vague morality is SO well done and serves the film perfectly. If only the director could've restrained his ""these films influenced me"" excesses, I'd have given this 5 stars.
