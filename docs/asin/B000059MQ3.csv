It is certainly worth seeing this movie about the train yards of New York, but it doesn't quite reach that point of excelling. The story is not fast paced and you must be patient with the movie along the way. In the end though I think you will say not bad, just not great. Wahlberg turns in a decent performance as does Phoenix, Theron, and Caan, but none of them made me feel I cared what happened to them. This shows the underbelly of the corruption in some companies trying to win contracts and political influence as well. A good drama when you don't mind a slower pace.

However, this tale is mostly about the characters' inability to avoid a life either directly in crime or allied to it.  As such, it is unrelievedly grim and may be offputting to viewers on that basis alone. I can't help comparing it to ""Requiem for a Dream,"" that dealt with much more horrific material, every character's descent into drug hell.  However, whereas this film was linear and almost plodding at times, ""Requiem for a Dream, was so artistically done and with such imaginative cutting edge storytelling techniques, that its grim subject matter never sunk it.  James Caan is in here playing the lead gangster for perhaps the one zillionith time since his Sonny Corleone ""Godfather"" days.

""Daniel""","[21, 22]","After LITTLE ODESSA in 1994, THE YARDS is quite an impressive second movie of american writer/director James Gray who plays in the same league than Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola or Sidney Lumet. Furthermore, James Gray has given two important roles to James Caan and Ellen Burstyn and a choice like this can only be made by a clever and talented person. If you are not so fond of Ridley Scott's bodybuilt gladiators, try for a change a movie with more brains than muscles. In the long run, it gives more satisfaction.THE YARDS is a movie about ambiguity, a mood created firstly by the images of the movie, cold and almost metallic for the exterior scenes but warm and always red, brown or yellow for the interior scenes. This antagonism is also underlined by the recurrent theme of the electric lights which suddenly plunge the characters in a black no-man's land several times during the course of the movie.James - Frank Olchin - Caan is the most ambiguous character of the movie. He may appear as a rotten businessman ready to corrupt anything that has power at times but can also develop a &quot;Don Corleone&quot; &agrave; la Brando attitude when trying to protect his family. Superb job from James Caan. Mark - Leo Handler - Wahlberg is also not a straight character and one important scene of the movie confirms this point. After having been abandoned by his pairs, he's ready to join the enemy and crucify his former friends.THE YARDS is smart, beautifully filmed and has a superb cast. Why not try this Miramax DVD ? It offers a - for once - interesting behind the screen featurette, seven or eight extra-trailers, a commentary by James Gray, a french dubbed version and a gallery of paintings that has influenced James Gray for the special lightning of the movie.A DVD zone your library.",5,"FORGET  &quot;GLADIATOR&quot; ,  TRY  &quot;THE  YARDS&quot;",988588800,"04 30, 2001",2001,1800,"['LITTLE', 'ODESSA', '1994', 'YARDS', 'quite', 'impressive', 'second', 'movie', 'american', 'writer/director', 'James', 'Gray', 'who', 'same', 'league', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'Francis', 'Coppola', 'Sidney', 'Lumet', 'Furthermore', 'James', 'Gray', 'given', 'two', 'important', 'roles', 'James', 'Caan', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'choice', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'made', 'clever', 'talented', 'person', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'fond', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'bodybuilt', 'gladiators', 'try', 'change', 'movie', 'more', 'brains', 'muscles', 'long', 'run', 'more', 'satisfaction.THE', 'YARDS', 'movie', 'ambiguity', 'mood', 'created', 'firstly', 'images', 'movie', 'cold', 'almost', 'metallic', 'exterior', 'scenes', 'warm', 'always', 'red', 'brown', 'yellow', 'interior', 'scenes', 'antagonism', 'also', 'underlined', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'electric', 'lights', 'suddenly', 'plunge', 'characters', 'black', 'no-man', 'land', 'several', 'times', 'course', 'movie.James', 'Frank', 'Olchin', 'Caan', 'most', 'ambiguous', 'character', 'movie', 'may', 'appear', 'rotten', 'businessman', 'ready', 'corrupt', 'anything', 'power', 'times', 'can', 'also', 'develop', 'quot', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'quot', 'agrave', 'Brando', 'attitude', 'when', 'trying', 'protect', 'family', 'Superb', 'job', 'James', 'Caan', 'Mark', 'Leo', 'Handler', 'Wahlberg', 'also', 'not', 'straight', 'character', 'one', 'important', 'scene', 'movie', 'point', 'having', 'been', 'abandoned', 'pairs', 'ready', 'join', 'enemy', 'crucify', 'former', 'friends.THE', 'YARDS', 'smart', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'superb', 'cast', 'Why', 'not', 'try', 'Miramax', 'DVD', 'once', 'interesting', 'screen', 'featurette', 'seven', 'eight', 'extra-trailers', 'commentary', 'James', 'Gray', 'french', 'dubbed', 'version', 'gallery', 'paintings', 'influenced', 'James', 'Gray', 'special', 'lightning', 'movie.A', 'DVD', 'zone', 'library']",N/A

Wahlberg is fresh out of prison on a grand theft auto rap. He wants to go straight and get into his ""uncle's"" train manufacturing business but things aren't so easy. Uncle, however, has a guy (Phoenix) who handles certain ""business"" aspects for him. Wahlberg goes out with him one night on business and things go way South. Now Wahlberg is in a deep hole with seemingly no way out. Will he prevail?!I liked this movie a lot. It sports a great cast, all of whom do a fine job, and it's a good storyline. Much of the power in the story derives from the relationships of all the characters. The one crucial incident sets up a domino effect that seems to go on and on. As a result this doesn't appear contrived. All the incidents have a more natural flow. I really wanted to know how these things would play themselves out. I had serious doubts as to whether or not the film makers could pull this off. For my money they did. There was one part of the resolve I could have done without but overall I was satisfied.All the production aspects are very good.

573573,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B000059MQ3,"""flickjunkie""","[2, 3]","It is hard to understand why this film couldn't command better distribution than it did.  It has a bankable cast, a strong story and a realistic presentation.  It is a raw and dark tale about corruption by contractors supplying the transit system in New York City.  Parts of the story are all too familiar and the entire film is very Godfatheresque.  However, while ""The Godfather"" glorified organized crime, this film gives a much grittier view of the dirty deals and conniving, stripped of the Hollywood veneer.  That is precisely what I liked about it, and in all likelihood, it is the reason that it foundered on the market.Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) is just returning home from prison on a car theft conviction when the movie opens.  He is repentant and sincerely wants to go straight.  The deck is stacked against him though, because everyone he knows other than his mother (Ellen Burstyn), aunt (Faye Dunaway) and cousin (Charlize Theron) is corrupt.  Leo applies for a job with his uncle Frank (James Caan) who is a contractor supplying parts to the New York subway system.  He is reunited with an old friend, Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix) who is currently working for Frank.  Willie is eyeball deep in shady deals including the sabotage of other suppliers.  One night a sabotage mission goes wrong and Leo assaults a policeman while trying to escape the scene.  A manhunt ensues and both the cops and Leo's uncle are trying to hunt him down.  With sinister intent, Uncle Frank wants to find him first so he won't blow the lid on the crooked dealings.The story, written and directed by James Gray, delves into various character studies that bog down at times.  However, speaking as a person who once lived there, it is an excellent rendering of New York attitudes and mannerisms, and includes plenty of not-so-glamorous shots of New York's seething underbelly.  This is a New Yorker's eye view of the city, far from the glitz of Broadway, Wall Street and the art galleries.  It shows the competitiveness and machismo of a segment of society known only to the locals.The acting by the ensemble cast is outstanding.  All the players capture the essence of the New York middle class gestalt beautifully.  Mark Wahlberg delivers a somber but resolute character trapped in a vortex of graft and corruption.  His performance is understated yet powerful.  James Caan is one of the best at playing the small-time racketeer and he nails it again with his portrayal of the dirty dealing supplier.  Joaquin Phoenix also shines as Willie, giving him a macho personality and the ability to rationalize any act according to his own code of morality.  The cast includes Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn and Charlize Theron in strong supporting roles.  Steve Allen makes an extended cameo as the tainted commissioner.This film is excellent and has been sadly overlooked by the distributors and the public.  I rated it a 9/10 despite a somewhat familiar storyline, because the presentation is so precise and the style so un-sanitized.  The film has a real New York feeling to it, especially recognizable to anyone who has lived there.  It has my vote for the sleeper of 2000.",5,Excellent look at the seething underbelly of New York City.,987984000,"04 23, 2001",2001,3167,"['hard', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'command', 'better', 'distribution', 'did', 'bankable', 'cast', 'strong', 'story', 'realistic', 'presentation', 'raw', 'dark', 'tale', 'corruption', 'contractors', 'supplying', 'transit', 'system', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Parts', 'story', 'are', 'too', 'familiar', 'entire', 'film', 'very', 'Godfatheresque', 'However', 'Godfather', 'glorified', 'organized', 'crime', 'film', 'much', 'grittier', 'view', 'dirty', 'deals', 'conniving', 'stripped', 'Hollywood', 'veneer', 'precisely', 'what', 'liked', 'likelihood', 'reason', 'foundered', 'market.Leo', 'Handler', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'just', 'returning', 'home', 'prison', 'car', 'theft', 'conviction', 'when', 'movie', 'repentant', 'sincerely', 'go', 'straight', 'deck', 'stacked', 'everyone', 'other', 'mother', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'aunt', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'cousin', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'corrupt', 'Leo', 'applies', 'job', 'uncle', 'Frank', 'James', 'Caan', 'who', 'contractor', 'supplying', 'parts', 'New', 'York', 'subway', 'system', 'reunited', 'old', 'friend', 'Willie', 'Gutierrez', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'who', 'currently', 'working', 'Frank', 'Willie', 'eyeball', 'deep', 'shady', 'deals', 'including', 'sabotage', 'other', 'suppliers', 'One', 'night', 'sabotage', 'mission', 'wrong', 'Leo', 'assaults', 'policeman', 'trying', 'escape', 'scene', 'manhunt', 'ensues', 'cops', 'Leo', 'uncle', 'are', 'trying', 'hunt', 'down', 'sinister', 'intent', 'Uncle', 'Frank', 'find', 'first', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blow', 'lid', 'crooked', 'dealings.The', 'story', 'written', 'directed', 'James', 'Gray', 'various', 'character', 'studies', 'bog', 'down', 'times', 'However', 'speaking', 'person', 'who', 'once', 'lived', 'there', 'excellent', 'rendering', 'New', 'York', 'attitudes', 'mannerisms', 'plenty', 'not-so-glamorous', 'shots', 'New', 'York', 'seething', 'underbelly', 'New', 'Yorker', 'eye', 'view', 'city', 'far', 'glitz', 'Broadway', 'Wall', 'Street', 'art', 'galleries', 'competitiveness', 'machismo', 'segment', 'society', 'known', 'only', 'locals.The', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'outstanding', 'players', 'capture', 'essence', 'New', 'York', 'middle', 'class', 'gestalt', 'beautifully', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'somber', 'resolute', 'character', 'trapped', 'vortex', 'graft', 'corruption', 'performance', 'understated', 'yet', 'powerful', 'James', 'Caan', 'one', 'best', 'playing', 'small-time', 'racketeer', 'again', 'portrayal', 'dirty', 'dealing', 'supplier', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'also', 'Willie', 'giving', 'macho', 'personality', 'ability', 'rationalize', 'act', 'according', 'own', 'code', 'morality', 'cast', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'strong', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'extended', 'cameo', 'tainted', 'commissioner.This', 'film', 'excellent', 'been', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'distributors', 'public', 'rated', '9/10', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'storyline', 'presentation', 'so', 'precise', 'style', 'so', 'un-sanitized', 'film', 'real', 'New', 'York', 'feeling', 'especially', 'recognizable', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', 'there', 'vote', 'sleeper', '2000']",N/A

Trouble quickly ensues.  Leo realizes the large scale corruption in the business and he gets caught up in and accused of a crime he didnt committ. To top it off Leo seems to have an unhealthy attraction to his cousint (Theron) How he does or does not escape this dilemna is the finale of the film.Aside from a stellar performance by Jacquin Phoenix, the cast is rather flat from lack of plot and character development.  Most of the big names (Theron and Dunaway especially) are underused.  The  plot is lackluster until the final half hour of the film.

Age happens, and in the case of this film it has aged well.The title refers to the rail yards of Queens where contractors repair and rebuild the New York's subway cars. These contracts are lucrative, so graft and corruption rule. When Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) gets out of prison having taken the fall for his friends and family, he finds his aunt Kitty (Faye Dunaway)  married to Frank Olchin (James Caan), one of the big contractors; he's battling with a minority-owned firm for contracts. Willie Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix), Leo's best friend, is Frank's bag man and heads a crew of midnight saboteurs who ruin the work of the Puerto Rican-owned firm. Leo needs a job, so Willie pays him to be his back-up. Then things go badly wrong one night, a cop IDs Leo, and everyone now wants him out of the picture. Besides his ailing mom (Ellen Burstyn) and his cousin Erica Charlize Theron) , to whom can Leo turn? He is drawn into a world of sabotage, high-stakes payoffs and even murder. Then, he discovers a secret that makes him the target of the city's most ruthless family - his own. How Leo responds is a lesson in courage.Strong cast, good screenplay by Director James Gray (`We Own the Night', `Little Odessa', etc) and Matt Reeves, atmospheric creative cinematography by Harris Savides, and a very beautiful musical score by Howard Shore make this little drama intense and moving.

573578,A3DUFMYW4GZK34,B000059MQ3,Greg White,"[1, 3]","My main attraction to this movie was the fact that Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin(WA-KEEN) Phoenix starred together.  Well, it ended up being a pretty big disappointment in my book.  If you looking for a good Mark Wahlberg flick, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; or &quot;Three Kings&quot; is definitely the way to go.  As for Phoenix, your best bet would be &quot;Gladiator&quot;, although I'm sure everyone is tired of that by now.On the amazon.com Editorial Review, at one point, compares &quot;The Yards&quot; to &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  Not really.  It's an all-star cast just like &quot;The Godfather&quot;, which includes Wahlberg, Phoenix, Charlize Theron, Ellen Burstyn, Faye Dunaway, and James Caan(who was in &quot;The Godfather&quot;).  The cast just isn't utilized the way it could have been.  Charlize Theron is an awesome actress who just stands around and looks pretty in most of her scenes.  James Caan plays a pretty good bad guy, and Phoenix, well, everybody by now knows he's the guy we LOVE to HATE.  Wahlberg is a great actor when used right, and he just doesn't live up to his potential this time around.The plot is quite intriguing from the get-go, but loses it's flavor about 30 minutes in.  Leo(Wahlberg's name in &quot;Planet of the Apes as well, coincidence?) has just gotten out of jail and wants to get back to normal, and support his struggling mother.  He takes a job with Willie who does all of Leo's uncle's dirty work.  Uncle Frank runs the train business around his area, and is the stepfather of Charlize Theron's character, which would make her Leo's cousin.  Phoenix and Theron play an &quot;engaged&quot; couple.  Well, Leo eventually finds out what Willie does, and ends up on the run from the cops.  As the plot evolves, we find out that the two cousins were &quot;caught together&quot; at the age of fifteen.  Here we have a pretty interesting sub-plot, but nothing ever really happens there.  So, we move on and Leo does everything in his power to stop Frank and Willie.  I guess it's only fitting that as the film closes, the cameras on Leo riding a subway.Onto the features of the DVD.  The best feature here is unquestionably the transfer.  The transfer is pretty much flawless, and I caught myself more intrigued by the transfer than the fim itself half the time.  Then we've got a behind-the-scenes look at the film which is okay, but nothing great.  There's a commentary which is also decent, and original concept art.  Finishing off the DVD are a trailor from this movie and several unadvertised Miramx/Dimension movie trailors.This movie isn't great and again, I find myself wanting to give it 3.5 stars, but there are no .5's(which Amazon should consider).  If your into semi-intriguing plotlines, and the burrows of New York, give this a try.

""The Yards"" was nominated for the Golden Palm Award @ the Cannes Film Festival.  Gray does a good job of keeping the action moving, but my attraction to the film was that it was an excellent character-based drama with performances that made me care about the characters.Mark Wahlberg was nominated for an Oscar forThe Departed (Widescreen Edition)in 2006.  As Leo Handler in this film, his performance is tightly controlled.  He seems to be the moral centerpiece of the film, going to jail without ratting out his friends & then stepping up to help weed out corruption.  Whether this leap is entirely believable is debatable.  Wahlberg is put through the plot's big squeeze, but we don't entirely see this coming.  Perhaps Gray intended the reversal in the courtroom as a surprise.Joaquin Phoenix has two Oscar nominations for ""Gladiator"" in 2000 & ""Walk the Line"" in 2005.  He won a Best Supporting Actor award from the Broadcast Film Critics Association & the National Board of Review for ""The Yards.""  As Willie Guiterrez, he's got a short fuse, thinks he can bully romance & yet we somehow still like him for the goodness that seeps through his sleazy side.Charlize Theron who won her Oscar for ""Monster"" in 2003 & was nominated in 2005 for ""North Country"" does an excellent job as Erica Stoltz, the girl who has a past with Leo, a present with Willie & issues with her step-father Frank.  It's a riveting tightrope she walks.Frank Olchin, Eric's step-father, is played by James Caan, who was Oscar-nominated for ""The Godfather"" in 1972.  Caan plays his usual likeable bad guy as he interfaces with Willie & plays Leo as a chump.Leo's mother, Val Handler, is played by Ellen Burstyn who has five Oscar nominations in addition to her win for ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" in 1973.  DVD extras reveal that she was Gray's first choice for the role.  She plays the ailing mother well, balancing maternal affection with a realistic view of the world.Faye Dunaway plays Frank's wife & Val's sister Kitty Olchin.  Dunaway who was Oscar-nominated for the two classic films ""Bonnie & Clyde"" & ""Chinatown,"" won her award for ""Network"" in 1976.  She credits Gray with sizing her minimal performance, which speaks to his style & makes her courtroom collapse all the more dramatic.While ""The Yards"" may be a bit uneven, I found it gripping.  It spoke to an moral center that exists even in flawed men & women.  How each character adapts to the challenges of family loyalty, business pressures & their ethical center makes the film meaty, worthy of seeing again from time to time.

I just have to assume they had their reasons. It is neither the best nor the most original movie around, but it also is far from dreadful. It is a good example of the fact that all movies that bomb at the boxoffice are not bad ones, just as all hits are not good movies.Leo Handler [Mark Wahlberg] has just been released from a New York state prison, where he served time for auto theft. He is returning to his mother's apartment in The Bronx. Leo is determined to stay out of trouble. The problem is that he isn't the brightest guy on the block. He gets an interview with his aunt's latest husband, Frank Olchin [James Caan], who runs a company that services the trains for the New York subway system. Willie Gutierrez [Joaquin Phoenix] is Leo's best friend and has been working for Frank for some time. Frank politely suggests that Leo go to machinist school for a couple of years. After that, he is welcome to work for Frank. This doesn't satisfy Leo's need for an immediate income, and he can't understand how Willie, who didn't go to school either, works for him. It turns out that Willie's job is a not very nice one that pays very well. He is the one who greases the palms of various officials and who sabotages the work of other companies so that Frank can get more business. Willie tells Leo to hang out with him to see how the operation works. One night a terrible incident puts Leo and Willie, as well as Leo's family, in great jeopardy.This is a fairly dark movie. It is about how people inadvertently get in too deep and about how your friends and family can turn against you when their security is threatened. Its themes are not ones which lead to a happy ending, although The Yards manages to end on a hopeful note.The basis of this story has been done several times before. It is the cast that makes The Yards so watchable. Mark Wahlberg is excellent as always, and the fact that this ex-teen pop singer made the transition to serious actor still amazes me.

573598,A1OH2SIJ0U46Q6,B000059MQ3,"""patsydoc""","[5, 5]","I've wanted to see this movie for such a long time.  I'm pretty sure that this film was limited in release because even when it was out I couldn't find any theater within 50 miles that was playing it...it must have been one of those LA/NY movies.  So, when ""The Yards"" finally became rentable at Blockbuster I made it my mission to get a copy.  I had to see this film (Joaquin is in it!).Anyway, to the review:  I liked this movie.  I wasn't really sure what decade it was supposed to take place in and that kinda distracted me-- the cars seemed pretty modern but the music, houses, furniture, and even some of the clothes were hard to judge.  I'll just assume that it takes place ""in the now"" but I don't think it really matters...it just bugged me.  The acting was good but nothing phenomenal, I guess I just expect good stuff from these actors.  The casting was pretty typical-- Mark Wahlberg (baby faced tough guy ...), Charlize Theron (weepy girlfriend, except she has ... greasy black hair and wears lots of black eyeliner in this...it's an interesting change of look for her), and Joaquin Phoenix (bad guy with good intentions).The story is based around the character Leo, played by Marky-Mark (oops, I mean Mark Wahlberg...so sorry).  Leo just got out of prison; he wants to start a new life as a ""productive member of society"" so he looks for a job at his Uncle Frank's (James Caan) rail repair yard where his best friend Willie (Joaquin Phoenix) works.  Willie takes Leo under his wing and shows him the ropes of the rail repair industry.  Everything is looking good for Leo until he learns more about what Willie's job entails-- blackmail, ""favors"", vandalism, sabotage, and ultimately murder.  Almost exactly the same moment when Leo realizes that what Willies does is illegal, things start to fall apart in a major way-- after an unfortunate turn of events, Leo ends up being the prime suspect for a murder he did not commit and is forced to be ""on the run"".Poor Leo doesn't know what to do or who to turn to...the police want him for murder and his Uncle wants him because he knows too much about the illegal dealing of his rail repair company.  Leo must decide between doing what's right and betraying his family or taking the fall for a murder and going back to prison for life.  That's the main plot and that's all I'm saying....if I told you anymore you wouldn't need to see the film.Recommendation:  ""The Yards"" has a good plot line and is well acted.  If you're going to buy it or rent it make sure you snag the DVD, it's got lots of extra stuff on it like director's commentary and behind-the-scenes/makings of footage.  It's basically an organized crime family type of movie but not quite...I guess if you like ""The Godfather"" and other mafia related films you'll like this.  If you like Mark Wahlberg you'll like this film.

On the other hand, for some, Walhberg's acting isperhaps an acquired taste, much like watching paint dry.One strength is the lesson it tells, of the consequences of one'sactions, or that of a small group of people holding key positions, oneveryone in society, their family, friends close and distant, whenthere is misbehavior.According to this movie, there are cases when big-ticket salesplayers (not just small time salesmen) get an edge, through unethicalmeans, through payoffs, not so legal actions, and human coercionagainst competitors in bidding for contracts in the tens of USDmillions.It realistically tells of methods that are perfectly legitimate ingaining the favor, influence and friendship of people by knowing whattheir soft spots are, and indulging those through gifts. The trick,of course, is to know when a gift stops being one, and turns into apayoff.This DVD will also appeal to those enjoying a wide-screen release,with a very high quality cinematography, sharp images, andirreproachable technique. The soundtrack  is made up of tastefullyselected numbers, that don't distract from the story.What will stick with the public, are the highs and lows, that theprotagonists in this picture go through.The less credible part, is the suggestion that the character playedby Walhberg, presented as somewhat of a broken down engine of sortsin society, becomes holier than the Pope after 90 mins, turningagainst everyone whom he knew and trusted, merely from the latter'sdecision to cut their losses from the repeated, ever more seriouscomedy of errors made by Walhberg's character.The strong point of this movie, is its tragic aspects, and by nothaving a predictable ending,  incorporating many realistic elements,such as sickness, health, death, fear, greed, broken relationships,loathing, solidarity, coercion, hate, love, confusion, joy. Most willidentify how  some people are able to control their destinies to alesser or stronger degree, depending on their skill and experience,and luck.A lasting demonstration, is how quickly a burning hot flame,potentially turns into bitter cold ice, in terms of one's humanity,personal relationships, one's professional outlook, and how everyonein society is dependent and influenced by other people comprising it.THE YARDS also underlines how one tragedy is always accompanied byanother.Some viewers may have preferred a less abrupt ending, which almost ispresented as an afterthought, after the story had built to a climax.",3,A burning hot flame  potentially turns into bitter cold ice,1180224000,"05 27, 2007",2007,2698,"['YARDS', '2000', 'will', 'interest', 'fans', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'CharlizeTheron', 'physical', 'charisma', 'James', 'Caan', 'world', 'class', 'acting', 'andcredibility', 'bringing', 'life', 'theme', 'rarely', 'touched', 'theaters', 'other', 'hand', 'Walhberg', 'acting', 'isperhaps', 'acquired', 'taste', 'much', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry.One', 'strength', 'lesson', 'consequences', ""one'sactions"", 'small', 'group', 'people', 'holding', 'key', 'positions', 'oneveryone', 'society', 'family', 'friends', 'close', 'distant', 'misbehavior.According', 'movie', 'are', 'cases', 'when', 'big-ticket', 'salesplayers', 'not', 'just', 'small', 'time', 'salesmen', 'get', 'edge', 'unethicalmeans', 'payoffs', 'not', 'so', 'legal', 'actions', 'human', 'coercionagainst', 'competitors', 'bidding', 'contracts', 'tens', 'USDmillions.It', 'realistically', 'methods', 'are', 'perfectly', 'legitimate', 'ingaining', 'favor', 'influence', 'friendship', 'people', 'knowing', 'whattheir', 'soft', 'spots', 'are', 'indulging', 'gifts', 'trick', 'course', 'know', 'when', 'gift', 'being', 'one', 'apayoff.This', 'DVD', 'will', 'also', 'appeal', 'enjoying', 'wide-screen', 'release', 'very', 'high', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'sharp', 'images', 'andirreproachable', 'technique', 'soundtrack', 'made', 'tastefullyselected', 'numbers', 'do', ""n't"", 'distract', 'story.What', 'will', 'stick', 'public', 'are', 'highs', 'lows', 'picture', 'go', 'through.The', 'less', 'credible', 'part', 'suggestion', 'character', 'playedby', 'Walhberg', 'presented', 'somewhat', 'broken', 'down', 'engine', 'sortsin', 'society', 'holier', 'Pope', '90', 'mins', 'everyone', 'whom', 'knew', 'trusted', 'merely', ""latter'sdecision"", 'cut', 'losses', 'repeated', 'ever', 'more', 'seriouscomedy', 'errors', 'made', 'Walhberg', 'character.The', 'strong', 'point', 'movie', 'tragic', 'aspects', 'nothaving', 'predictable', 'ending', 'incorporating', 'many', 'realistic', 'elements', 'such', 'sickness', 'health', 'death', 'fear', 'greed', 'broken', 'relationships', 'loathing', 'solidarity', 'coercion', 'hate', 'love', 'confusion', 'joy', 'Most', 'willidentify', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'able', 'control', 'destinies', 'alesser', 'stronger', 'degree', 'depending', 'skill', 'experience', 'luck.A', 'lasting', 'demonstration', 'how', 'quickly', 'burning', 'hot', 'flame', 'potentially', 'bitter', 'cold', 'ice', 'terms', 'one', 'humanity', 'personal', 'relationships', 'one', 'professional', 'outlook', 'how', 'everyonein', 'society', 'dependent', 'influenced', 'other', 'people', 'comprising', 'it.THE', 'YARDS', 'also', 'how', 'one', 'tragedy', 'always', 'accompanied', 'byanother.Some', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'preferred', 'less', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'almost', 'ispresented', 'afterthought', 'story', 'had', 'built', 'climax']",N/A

The feeling of paranoia is well achieved, partly because of the brooding score and very well-toned cinematography.But what kills the movie is its derivative story -- the strinking semblance to Godfather, City Hall, Heat, James Caan's own The Thief, and about a hundred other crime capers is hard to overlook.  To make matters worse, the plot is also sloppily constructed such that it can't resolve itself without losing its grip on the tension that it creates.James Caan is sharp as he brings his snakey charm into the role, come to think of it, all actors do very well to maintain the general grit, including a power-crazed Joaquin Phoenix and the good-hearted criminal Wahlberg.But about halfway through the movie the denouement already peeped out, making the rest of the proceedings merely a formality.

If you are just interested in suspense, you just get bored and we won't blame you for that.&quot;The Yards&quot; is certainly gloomy and dismal.  Its story is very slow, and in essence is never friendly to audience.  It deals with corruption in politics, business, and even human relationships in a relentless way.  Still, to me, what the film is trying to do should be considered admirable, and what it tells is worth our attention -- &quot;How far are we allowed do to survive?&quot;&quot;The Yard&quot; is about our moral as human, and inevitably the film is too serious for us to simply enjoy watching it, as I said.  It's like &quot;City Hall&quot; without its detective story element.  I also thought of &quot;The Godfather&quot; while watching it (James Caan in both films), and this feeling is not surprising, considering the serious subject matter about your fatal decision that changes your life forever.However, I must say several negative things about &quot;The Yard.&quot;  Though it is filled with first-rate cast from veterans (it's always a welcome thing for me to watch the veteran Victor Argo) and newcomers like Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix, and their performance is all perfect, the development of the story is sometimes contrived (for example, the double assaults on the Sunnyside Yard, the railroad yard) and the ending is a little predictable.  The good location helps, but the photograghy capturing its dark atomosphere, though I thought it fabulous, may cause some people to fall asleep.  And perhaps, the way the female characters are depicted may be off-putting, because all three key females in film suffer not a little from various reasons.  Fans of Charlize Theron should especially be warned as she plays a role whose relationship with Joaquin Phoenix becomes kind of torture.&quot;The Yards&quot; is overall a superb work, but too dark and heavy for fans in general.",4,Heavy Drama about Moral and Relationship That Went Wrong,1007251200,"12 2, 2001",2001,1994,"['Anyone', 'who', 'see', 'complex', 'characters', 'superb', 'acting', 'should', 'watch', 'film', 'are', 'just', 'interested', 'suspense', 'just', 'get', 'bored', 'wo', ""n't"", 'blame', 'that.', 'quot', 'Yards', 'quot', 'certainly', 'gloomy', 'dismal', 'story', 'very', 'slow', 'essence', 'never', 'friendly', 'audience', 'corruption', 'politics', 'business', 'even', 'human', 'relationships', 'relentless', 'way', 'Still', 'what', 'film', 'trying', 'do', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'admirable', 'what', 'attention', 'quot', 'How', 'far', 'are', 'allowed', 'do', 'survive', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yard', 'quot', 'moral', 'human', 'inevitably', 'film', 'too', 'serious', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'said', 'quot', 'City', 'Hall', 'quot', 'detective', 'story', 'element', 'also', 'thought', 'quot', 'Godfather', 'quot', 'watching', 'James', 'Caan', 'films', 'feeling', 'not', 'surprising', 'considering', 'serious', 'subject', 'matter', 'fatal', 'decision', 'life', 'forever.However', 'must', 'say', 'several', 'negative', 'things', 'quot', 'Yard.', 'quot', 'filled', 'first-rate', 'cast', 'veterans', 'always', 'welcome', 'thing', 'watch', 'veteran', 'Victor', 'Argo', 'newcomers', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'performance', 'perfect', 'development', 'story', 'sometimes', 'contrived', 'example', 'double', 'assaults', 'Sunnyside', 'Yard', 'railroad', 'yard', 'ending', 'little', 'predictable', 'good', 'location', 'photograghy', 'capturing', 'dark', 'atomosphere', 'thought', 'fabulous', 'may', 'cause', 'people', 'fall', 'asleep', 'perhaps', 'way', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'depicted', 'may', 'be', 'off-putting', 'three', 'key', 'females', 'film', 'suffer', 'not', 'little', 'various', 'reasons', 'Fans', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'should', 'especially', 'be', 'warned', 'role', 'relationship', 'Joaquin', 'Phoenix', 'kind', 'torture.', 'quot', 'Yards', 'quot', 'overall', 'superb', 'work', 'too', 'dark', 'heavy', 'fans', 'general']",N/A
