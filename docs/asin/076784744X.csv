22162,A2PV6GK1HV54Y9,076784744X,ADRIENNE MILLER,"[0, 1]","Hanging Up has gotten some horrible reviews but I think this film is quite good. Starring Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow, and Diane Keaton who also directs this film, is the story of three sisters who are very different from each other but unite and ultimately let go of some old age resentment through their father's illness. Ryan owns this film, she carries every scene and I think her dramatic side as an actress never gets the credit she fully deserves. Some of the scenes are a bit wacky but underneath is a warm and engaging family drama/comedy.",4,It's not that bad!,1190246400,"09 20, 2007",2007,542,"['Hanging', 'Up', 'gotten', 'horrible', 'reviews', 'think', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'Starring', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'also', 'film', 'story', 'three', 'sisters', 'who', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'other', 'unite', 'ultimately', 'let', 'go', 'old', 'age', 'resentment', 'father', 'illness', 'Ryan', 'film', 'scene', 'think', 'dramatic', 'side', 'actress', 'never', 'credit', 'fully', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'wacky', 'underneath', 'warm', 'engaging', 'family', 'drama/comedy']",N/A

All the good stuff was crammed into that trailer, and what unfortunately  occupies the rest of the movie is a mish-mash of poorly written,  over-acted, unorganized junk.  This movie is bad.Again, the consumer  might be fooled by the powerful names associated with this movie.  Meg  Ryan, Diane Keaton, Nora Ephron, Walter Mathau, Carol Turner and Lisa  Kudrow normally would make for a strong team.  In this case, they are given  little to work with and what they are given, they botch.The premise of  this film is good, but the execution of that premise is what makes this  movie a stinker.  The drama is forced, the comedy lacks humor and the  characters are one-dimensional and devoid of any real emotion.  The  emotions they do show seem forced.  The story takes too many twists and  turns for no particular reason that do not lead to any real point, until  the end is reached.  At the end, there is some kind of bonding between the  sisters that makes absolutely no sense.Don't waste your time with this  one.

It was terrible. The  symbolism of telephones ringing incessantly was a little more than I could  handle. The actors - Meg Ryan - not a favorite of mine; I haven't seen her  in anything I liked since &quot;You've got mail&quot; (or whatever it was  called) with Tom Hanks, and then, she was just reprising her role from  &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;. Diane Keaton - great actress in a crappy  role. It is too bad that women of such calibre only get the really stupid  roles and women with absolutely no talent get the good stuff. Lisa Kudrow -  able to play more than her friends character, is also a good actress with a  crappy role. Exactly who wrote this film? The ending was so obvious that I  think whoever wrote it should pay the audience to watch it. All the females  were silly. Every last one of them. There was no dept of character  what-so-ever - none. Walter Matthau was also wasted in that film. A classic  actor with dozens of proper films under his belt. He could do that role in  his sleep. I am inclined to say that perhaps he did. Those scenes with the  photographs and the flashbacks with her mother - nothing new. Only  children, who have not had years of movie going experience would find this  film mildly interesting. I give it a D. But then, I am yet to watch a film  of such calibre which matches up to &quot;A Cat on A Hot Tin Roof&quot;.  Nice try Meg. Next time try acting a little.

22169,A22IK3I6U76GX0,076784744X,Calle,"[0, 0]","This movie got a lot of bad reviews from all over the world. Naturally, I got curious to see how these skilled actresses (Diane Keaton also directed), and screenwriters could make such a bad movie - if it was as bad as the critics thought, that is. After seeing the movie I have mixed feelings for it.All cast members are quite good, especially the three female stars and Walter Matthau, as their senile father, Lou. It feels a little sad to see him, however. He looks so old and makes his bacon-eating character in ""Grumpy Old men"", from 1993 look like a healthy young man. But he makes a good performance in this movie, which became his last. Meg Ryan plays Eve, the middle sister who takes most care of their dad and visits him at the hospital, while her sisters focus on their careers. The oldest sister, Georgia (Keaton) is working more than ever on the fifth anniversary edition of her magazine, ""Georgia"", which she named after herself, and Maddy (Kudrow) is an actress in a soap opera.What this movie lacks the most is a strong plot. It focuses on the lives of the three sisters, mostly on Eve's. It has a number of flashback scenes that make the movie feel slightly confusing. The characters aren't interesting enough to compensate for the weak plot.This is a comedy, but compared to for example ""When Harry Met Sally"", written by Nora Ephron, who helped her sister, Delia, write the screenplay for this movie, it's quite humorless. There are few funny scenes. The lack of humor makes it feel more like a too lightweight drama. However, the movie does show that when one family member takes on too much responsibility, it often leads to conflict.To sum up, Hanging Up is not a totally bad movie. However, it should be much funnier and more touching than it is. But it has some good acting performances, and whoever likes any of the actors or actresses should give it a try, they're all doing a good job.",3,"Not bad, but something is missing here.",1005436800,"11 11, 2001",2001,1912,"['movie', 'got', 'lot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'world', 'Naturally', 'got', 'curious', 'see', 'how', 'skilled', 'actresses', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'also', 'directed', 'screenwriters', 'could', 'make', 'such', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'thought', 'seeing', 'movie', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'it.All', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'especially', 'three', 'female', 'stars', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'senile', 'father', 'Lou', 'little', 'sad', 'see', 'however', 'so', 'old', 'bacon-eating', 'character', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'men', '1993', 'look', 'healthy', 'young', 'man', 'good', 'performance', 'movie', 'became', 'last', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Eve', 'middle', 'sister', 'who', 'most', 'care', 'dad', 'hospital', 'sisters', 'focus', 'careers', 'oldest', 'sister', 'Georgia', 'Keaton', 'working', 'more', 'ever', 'fifth', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'magazine', 'Georgia', 'named', 'Maddy', 'Kudrow', 'actress', 'soap', 'movie', 'most', 'strong', 'plot', 'lives', 'three', 'sisters', 'mostly', 'Eve', 'number', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'make', 'movie', 'feel', 'slightly', 'confusing', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'enough', 'compensate', 'weak', 'plot.This', 'comedy', 'compared', 'example', 'When', 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sally', 'written', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'who', 'helped', 'sister', 'Delia', 'write', 'screenplay', 'movie', 'quite', 'humorless', 'are', 'few', 'funny', 'scenes', 'lack', 'humor', 'feel', 'more', 'too', 'lightweight', 'drama', 'However', 'movie', 'show', 'when', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'too', 'much', 'responsibility', 'often', 'conflict.To', 'sum', 'up', 'Hanging', 'Up', 'not', 'totally', 'bad', 'movie', 'However', 'should', 'be', 'much', 'funnier', 'more', 'touching', 'good', 'acting', 'performances', 'whoever', 'actors', 'actresses', 'should', 'give', 'try', ""'re"", 'doing', 'good', 'job']",N/A

I'm sure it's going to be good but is this movie more geared to women?  Will I even care for it?First, this movie is either...you love it or  hate it.  It is a story about three sisters and their cranky father who is  getting old, tends to drink a lot and when the people you love start to  lose their memory.  Many people have people like this in their personal  lives and can related with the three sisters.  Trying to have your own  life, raise a family, staying close with your family and watching over your  parent.  You see the character Eve (Meg Ryan) evolve.Although I enjoyed  the movie, it was short and I felt there were holes.  For one, they  included a deleted sequence in the movie which I felt should have not been  cut.  In fact, when you watch the HBO First Look on the making of  &quot;Hanging Up&quot; which comes with the DVD, they show a lot of the  sequence that was later cut in the movie.  I did like the casting of the  three women.  Each are different in character but aren't all siblings.  Meg  Ryan was very good, Lisa Kudrow was almost like her &quot;Friends&quot;  character and Diane Keaton still has it :)As for the DVD, the audio is  more dialogue but you can hear the girls speak clearly.  The colors are  very nice and I like the use of the red, white and black colors.  The color  coordination with the clothes of the women and so forth.

22173,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,076784744X,Dennis Littrell,"[1, 3]","Meg Ryan is particularly adorable here mainly because she is so sweet to her poor old dad (Walter Matthau) and is so good and long-suffering compared to her sisters Diane Keaton (self-obsessed tycoon, Georgia) and Lisa Kudrow (irresponsible soap actress, Maddy).  Yes, this is a Nora Ephron chick flick, and yes it takes dead aim at a female audience and hits the bull's-eye; however the combination of realistic family dynamics and the all too true characterizations lift this above--quite a bit above--the usual exploitation fare.  Personally I think this is superior to the Ephron/Meg Ryan/Tom Hanks hits, You've Got Mail (1998) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).  There is, as part of the plot, this curious thing that Ephron has with communications media.  In You've Got Mail (a remake, by the way, of Shop Around the Corner (1940) starring James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan) it was the Internet that figured in.  In Sleepless In Seattle, it was the radio.  Here it's the telephone.  Hence the title, ""Hanging Up.""[Imagined dialogue from real life:Delia Ephron: (Staring incredulously at her cell phone in hand): Geez, everybody's always hanging up on me!Cut to:Nora Ephron (hanging up the phone; speaking aloud to herself): You know, that would make a great premise for a movie: Plucky, earnest younger sister always getting hung up on!  Ha!  (Grabs personal organizer.)  Make a note...]Matthau as the senile old rake of a dad behaving badly is funny and lovably pathetic; Kudrow is annoying as usual (= ""good casting""), and Keaton is adequate as the ""thinks only of herself and her career"" magazine publisher.  (The name of her new fashion 'zine is ""Georgia.""  Enough said.)  But the star here is Meg Ryan, make no mistake about that.  Director Diane Keaton dresses her oh so cute and has her do gumby kind of stuff and be vulnerable and caring and keeps the camera on that pixie face as much as possible.  (There are a couple of shots of her in an agreeably tight white tank-top style blouse.  But never mind.)  As the sweet, earnest, slightly ditzy Eve, Meg Ryan, looking younger than springtime (although she was 38--it's amazing how she looks younger at 38 than she did at say, 32, when she made Sleepless), will steal your heart.  If you like her you will love this cute movie about the trials and tribulations of some of America's well-to-do ladies even if you're a 18-year-old male stoner with rings through your nose.Yes Diane Keaton directed this, not Nora Ephron, who produced and co-wrote the script with her sister Delia Ephron, and I have to say Keaton did an excellent job and ought to take a spin as a director more often.  Of course the movie is distinctly an Ephron affair.  Nora's influence is obvious, and it is no coincidence that Henry Ephron had, like King Lear, three daughters who undoubtedly loved him well but with less than equal fervor.  (The third Ephron sister is Amy.)  So the family dynamics and dysfunctions are to some extent fictionalized bits from the life of the Ephron clan.  I wonder which sister is Meg?  Clearly Georgia is Nora.But enough of the ""biographical fallacy.""  It doesn't matter one whit about where the material came from.  The fact remains this is a highly entertaining movie.  Besides, believe it or believe it not, for those who want to know more, there is a TV documentary entitled The Making of ""Hanging Up"" (2000) in which Ryan, Keaton and Kudrow appear.

I guess Maddy is Amy.)But see this for Meg Ryan (anagram of her screen name: ""Germany""), one of the top stars of our time and always a delight to watch.

22175,A2198FZZMTJ38H,076784744X,D. Litton,"[1, 2]","&quot;Hanging Up&quot; is one of those movies that looks like it was made in the hopes that it would become an instant hit. Close, but no cigar. Based on the novel by Delia Ephron, which is an overall true account of her own experiences in life, the movie never seems to reach the goals it sets, despite a terrific cast of characters that features Walter Matthau in the last performance of his acting career. It does have its moments of humor and heart, which can make up for some of the inconsistencies in the story; it just depends on how you take it in.The movie begins with Eve placing her aging father, whose mind is becoming increasingly unstable, in a nursing home for special care. As she is leaving the hospital, she becomes involved in a minor auto accident with a doctor, who tells her to call his mother in order to work out the details of getting the cars repaired. Throughout the rest of the movie, we follow Eve around as she receives numerous calls on numerous phones from her father and her two sisters. Maddy, her younger sister, is an actress on a soap opera, while Georgia, her older sister, is the editor of her own, self-titled magazine. Both of them are too caught up in their own lives, which leaves Eve to care for her father on her own.The first and most noticeable thing that stands out as a problem for the movie is the unneccessary subplots and storylines which heavily bog the story down. From the very beginning, after Eve's auto accident, she continues to try and make contact with the doctor's mother, who we only meet once. While the whole setup is supposed to lead up to a heartwarming conversation between the two, which also sets up the title's symbolism, it will become increasingly irritating listening to Eve's incessant whining about her life's problems in an attempt to soften the doctor's heart as well as his mother's.Also, the subplot of Eve's preparations for a major banquet seem to have no place in a movie such as this. This is supposed to add to the stresses of Eve's life, accompanying her worries about her father and her constant communication with both of her sisters. All of this whining and rushing around leads up to the actual event, which seems even more misplaced than the actions leading up to it. Do they really think that the banquet will make good filler in the story?&quot;Hanging Up&quot; also deserves a placement alongside such movies as &quot;Hollow Man&quot; and &quot;Bless the &quot;Child&quot; for its supreme underachievement in the story. Writers Delia and Nora Ephron seemed to think that audiences would be more intrigued by watching Eve run around day and night, talking on her cell phone and trying to do ten things at once. What really would have made this movie work so much better is if they had taken out the plot machinations mentioned above and focused more on Eve's relationship with her father. We do get a couple of brief flashbacks to Eve's past with her father, some of the heartwarming, others painful, but they always leave, and we must return back to her regular life. With this technique, the emotion is given small amounts of running time to build, and is then cut back by the plot.However, the acting of this film does a good job in somewhat redeeming the film from becoming a total failure. Meg Ryan is well known for her brilliant comedic charm, and it shows extremely well in this film. She is also given a good opportunity to show a different, more emotional side, and she does excellent with the material she is given. Lisa Kudrow plays Maddy, the sister wrapped up in her television role, and she does good with the whiny, bratty character traits her role posesses. Diane Keaton takes on both sides of the camera, directing the film as well as playing the part of the eldest sister, Georgia, who is totally self-absorbed in her magazine and fame. She, like Kudrow, does a splendid job of playing this self-absorption bit to boot, while also giving us small hints of emotion behind the mask of fame. Walter Matthau is the ideal father figure for this movie, playing the part with excellence in credibility and authenticity. He is able to give us comedy and inspire emotion, walking both sides of the rope in a tricky but well-conquered position.After watching &quot;Hanging Up,&quot; I was not fully disappointed, but not fully satisfied, either. I fell in love with Meg Ryan, but not with her character. I enjoyed watching the cast at work, but not watching the qork itself. I did feel pangs of emotion and my heartstrings being tugged at, but not enough to fully immerse myself into the film. Overall, it has good intentions for itself, but falls shorts in meeting them, focusing more on the trivial than the true heart. In a way, this is a bit of a contradiction for the movie, which wishes to convey family emotion and warmth. Sometimes I just wanted to tell Eve, &quot;Hang up the phone already; your father needs you.&quot;",3,"Star power the only redeeming feature, yet it's a stretch",983836800,"03 6, 2001",2001,4930,"['quot', 'Hanging', 'Up', 'quot', 'one', 'movies', 'was', 'made', 'hopes', 'would', 'become', 'instant', 'hit', 'Close', 'cigar', 'Based', 'novel', 'Delia', 'Ephron', 'overall', 'true', 'account', 'own', 'experiences', 'life', 'movie', 'never', 'reach', 'goals', 'terrific', 'cast', 'characters', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'last', 'performance', 'acting', 'career', 'have', 'moments', 'humor', 'heart', 'can', 'make', 'up', 'inconsistencies', 'story', 'just', 'how', 'take', 'in.The', 'movie', 'Eve', 'placing', 'aging', 'father', 'mind', 'becoming', 'increasingly', 'unstable', 'nursing', 'home', 'special', 'care', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'involved', 'minor', 'auto', 'accident', 'doctor', 'who', 'call', 'mother', 'order', 'work', 'out', 'details', 'getting', 'cars', 'repaired', 'rest', 'movie', 'follow', 'Eve', 'numerous', 'calls', 'numerous', 'phones', 'father', 'two', 'sisters', 'Maddy', 'younger', 'sister', 'actress', 'soap', 'opera', 'Georgia', 'older', 'sister', 'editor', 'own', 'self-titled', 'magazine', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'lives', 'Eve', 'care', 'father', 'own.The', 'first', 'most', 'noticeable', 'thing', 'out', 'problem', 'movie', 'unneccessary', 'subplots', 'storylines', 'heavily', 'story', 'down', 'very', 'beginning', 'Eve', 'auto', 'accident', 'try', 'make', 'contact', 'doctor', 'mother', 'who', 'only', 'meet', 'once', 'whole', 'setup', 'supposed', 'lead', 'up', 'heartwarming', 'conversation', 'two', 'also', 'up', 'title', 'symbolism', 'will', 'become', 'increasingly', 'irritating', 'listening', 'Eve', 'incessant', 'whining', 'life', 'problems', 'attempt', 'soften', 'doctor', 'heart', 'as', 'well', ""mother's.Also"", 'subplot', 'Eve', 'preparations', 'major', 'banquet', 'seem', 'have', 'place', 'movie', 'such', 'supposed', 'add', 'stresses', 'Eve', 'life', 'accompanying', 'worries', 'father', 'constant', 'communication', 'sisters', 'whining', 'rushing', 'around', 'up', 'actual', 'event', 'even', 'more', 'misplaced', 'actions', 'leading', 'up', 'Do', 'really', 'think', 'banquet', 'will', 'make', 'good', 'filler', 'story', 'quot', 'Hanging', 'Up', 'quot', 'also', 'placement', 'alongside', 'such', 'movies', 'quot', 'Hollow', 'Man', 'quot', 'quot', 'Bless', 'quot', 'Child', 'quot', 'supreme', 'underachievement', 'story', 'Writers', 'Delia', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'seemed', 'think', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'intrigued', 'watching', 'Eve', 'run', 'around', 'day', 'night', 'talking', 'cell', 'phone', 'trying', 'do', 'ten', 'things', 'once', 'What', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'work', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'taken', 'out', 'plot', 'machinations', 'mentioned', 'focused', 'more', 'Eve', 'relationship', 'father', 'do', 'get', 'couple', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'Eve', 'past', 'father', 'heartwarming', 'others', 'painful', 'always', 'leave', 'must', 'return', 'back', 'regular', 'life', 'technique', 'emotion', 'given', 'small', 'amounts', 'running', 'time', 'build', 'then', 'cut', 'back', 'plot.However', 'acting', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'somewhat', 'redeeming', 'film', 'becoming', 'total', 'failure', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'well', 'known', 'brilliant', 'comedic', 'charm', 'extremely', 'well', 'film', 'also', 'given', 'good', 'opportunity', 'show', 'different', 'more', 'emotional', 'side', 'excellent', 'material', 'given', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Maddy', 'sister', 'wrapped', 'up', 'television', 'role', 'good', 'whiny', 'bratty', 'character', 'role', 'posesses', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'sides', 'camera', 'directing', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'part', 'eldest', 'sister', 'Georgia', 'who', 'totally', 'self-absorbed', 'magazine', 'fame', 'Kudrow', 'splendid', 'job', 'playing', 'self-absorption', 'bit', 'boot', 'also', 'giving', 'small', 'hints', 'emotion', 'mask', 'fame', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'ideal', 'father', 'figure', 'movie', 'playing', 'part', 'excellence', 'credibility', 'authenticity', 'able', 'give', 'comedy', 'inspire', 'emotion', 'walking', 'sides', 'rope', 'tricky', 'well-conquered', 'position.After', 'watching', 'quot', 'Hanging', 'Up', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'disappointed', 'not', 'fully', 'satisfied', 'fell', 'love', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'not', 'character', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'cast', 'work', 'not', 'watching', 'qork', 'did', 'feel', 'pangs', 'emotion', 'heartstrings', 'being', 'tugged', 'not', 'enough', 'fully', 'immerse', 'film', 'Overall', 'good', 'intentions', 'shorts', 'meeting', 'focusing', 'more', 'trivial', 'true', 'heart', 'way', 'bit', 'contradiction', 'movie', 'convey', 'family', 'emotion', 'warmth', 'Sometimes', 'just', 'wanted', 'tell', 'Eve', 'quot', 'Hang', 'phone', 'already', 'father', 'you.', 'quot']",N/A

22179,AFPD8B050ILB4,076784744X,Eso,"[0, 0]","Sadly-or as a consolation that legitimizes watching this-the most affecting moments of the pseudo feel-good &quot;Hanging Up&quot; are the most pathetic. The would-be dramedy has the elements of both, but the  timing of the elements are not mutually exclusive.Take, for  instance, Walter Matthau's drunken romp through his daughter's child's  Halloween party: what should have typified why Meg Ryan is haunted and  irked by her father's curmudgeonly demeanor and makes it hard for her to  come to terms with his imminent death and ultimately forgive him is reduced  to just a mere flashback that does little in the way of enhance our  understanding of Meg Ryan's attitude towards him presently and how she  comes to terms; one does not know whether to laugh or cry during the scene  where Meg Ryan relates details of a fake earthquake measuring  &quot;3.11&quot; or so on the Richter scale, glibly playing into her  delusional father's fantasy that his wife-albeit by the looks of things she  did it smartly-really did not walk out on him.Here again, is  another unresolved issue: why she left Matthau, and cannot make peace with  him. Matthau must be rolling over in his grave after having his last film  portray his character nothing more than the  grouch that people just-in the  backs of their minds-dismiss as old and love unconditionally.The most  cathartic moment of &quot;Hangin' Up&quot; finds Meg Ryan  &quot;disconnecting all her phones&quot; on which she and her sisters spend  half the movie-a very 90s technique suggested and employed by New Age gurus  and directress Nora Ephron so as to get in touch with one's self; it marks  the point where Ryan starts to artificially patch things up with her  sisters,one of whom is played by actress-turned-ego-maniacal director Diane  Keaton who is a Martha Stewart type domestic-diva.Metaphorically,  this &quot;disconnect&quot; represents the dispelling of the  &quot;hang-ups&quot; that have haunted the characters for years: one being  that Keaton's character stole a recipe from Ryan's character. Lisa Kudrow's  savvy delivery is wasted in the water here amidst the blandness of Ryan and  Keaton that her interactions with her canine are more comedic.

This film pins the schmaltzometer to the max and jams every stereotypical  female family relationship problem the Ephron's can think of into one  frenetic emotional catharsis.And that's its problem.  It is just too  busy with rhapsodic projectiles whizzing by in all directions.  The story  revolves around three sisters and their dad, exaggerated stereotypes all.  There is the hard driving, super successful, totally self absorbed oldest  sister Georgia (Diane Keaton), the manic, self sacrificing martyr of a  caretaker sister Eve (Meg Ryan) and the over achieving, self doubting, no  one takes me seriously, baby sister Maddy (Lisa Kudrow).  To add a little  nitroglycerin to the family mix, we have the alcoholic, emotionally  abusive, crotchety, crude, senile father (Walter Matthau) who is now in  rapidly declining health.There is no real plot here.  It is a character  study which focuses on the relationship between Eve and her father, with a  side order of everyone else.  As character studies go, it wasn't bad, but  the characters are so burdened with hackneyed stereotypes that no  subtleties can emerge.  The dialogue between the sisters is extremely  shrill and disjointed with everyone frequently talking at once.  The only  relief from all the shrieking is provided by Matthau's deadpan ribald  humor.The acting was strong by all, especially Walter Matthau, whose  sneering and lechery seem to get better the older he gets.  Unfortunately,  the characters were trite and despite all the talent on the screen, it was  difficult to connect with them.I rated this film a 6/10.  Subtract 2  points if you are male.  If you are female, add one point for each sister  you have and add another two if Walter Matthau reminds you of your dad.

In her other films she always tried to be cute and funny.  When I was younger I liked that, but then I found her boring.  But she's good in this one as the middle child who has the (mis)luck of caring for her dying father.  Keaton, on the other hand, is totally unconvincing as either a magazine mogul or first daughter, and she had no screen presence at all; plus her outfit and makeup, which are meant to make her character look younger than the actress herself, are a disaster.  Kudlow does what she does best: playing a dumb, clueless blonde.As for the story, it has certain charms, but ultimately falls apart because it's confusing and melodramatic.  (Be sure to watch a deleted scene on the DVD.)  As some reviewers pointed out all too often the movie seems directionless, and the on-screen chemistry of the three sisters is rather lacking.

Some of these movies are Hook and Mystery Men, and now, Hanging Up can be one of those movies I can add to my list. It boasts a flashy cast and the girly-vibe, but it never creates atmosphere and largely uninteresting.Lou Mozell (Walter Mathau) is an ageing screenwriter who is struck down by illness. His three very different daughters, who had been leading separate lives as an editor, Eve (Meg Ryan), an actress, Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), and a businesswoman, Georgia (Diane Keaton), come back together to look after their father. In doing so, the daughters come together and settle the differences between themselves.It has such a great, star-studded cast and could've become a really memorable and absorbing, maybe even Oscar worthy picture, if the script was up to at least the average standard and the story could've been twenty times more interesting. When it tries to be dramatic or moving, Hanging Up just ends up acting like a TV movie that has been stuck together like a puzzle, except the pieces aren't put in the correct places.

Three sisters have a dying father, but only one of them, Eve, is facing up  to her responsiblity.  The other two, Georgia, a magazine editor, and  Maddy, a soap opera actress, are very self-absorbed and are pursuing their  own lives and careers.  In flashbacks we reconstruct the family history,  from their mother leaving their father to his drunken interference with his  grandson's birthday party.  There are happy scenes, too, when the parents  are in love and their father dances and plays with them.  Eve is the  responsible one in every situation and soon her cell phone becomes a symbol  of everyone's reliance on her to carry the load for the rest of them.  Walter Matthau's performance as a dying man becomes all too poignant in  light of his recent death.  This film tends to jump around a bit without a  real focus, but we are given bits and pieces of wisdom and insight into  children facing a parent's death and their own mortality.

22192,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,076784744X,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[15, 15]","First off, don't expect a light comedy. This isn't one. But it IS a heartwarming movie which focuses on the complexities of dealing with an aging parent, one with memory issues (but anyone caring for a parent, memory issues or not, should relate to this one). Meg Ryan plays Eve, one of three daughters. Eve has the lion's share of responsibility for her father, Lou (Walter Matthau) - and that is an understatement! Meanwhile, Diane Keaton, as Georgia, is a self-centered, ambitious woman while Lisa Kudrow plays Maddy, a bit of a free spirit who is currently working in a soap opera.She has a small role but one she takes seriously and feels slighted by her sisters for not praising her acting efforts.My take on why this one got so many bad reviews is that I think viewers have to have gone through similar situations to relate to it. Younger viewers, those without elderly parents, might not connect with it. At a certain point in my life, I probably would have found it yawn-worthy. But not now.I have no idea why this movie seemed aimed at viewers who expect comedy. Some parts, especially scenes where Eve struggles to reconcile her parent's breakup as well as her father's drinking, his chaotic actions, and faltering memory...can be emotionally draining to view but worth the effort.Eve is clearly overwhelmed, as are many who have to care for aging parents, but she keeps striving to balance her father's needs with the demands of her business, her marriage, and son. In spite of her best efforts, Eve isn't holding things together very well and the cracks begin to show. She is edgy and tired and can't even imagine ""hanging up"" or disconnecting when she needs a break. Relating to the theme of hanging up...there is one remarkable scene in the movie where an empathetic stranger gives a gift of enlightenment to Eve, although it isn't THE ultimate solution, just a bit of grace during a turbulent time. This scene is worth viewing the entire movieThose who are the primary caregiver for an ill parent or one with Alzheimers should relate strongly to Eve's situation. But - as noted - don't expect a comedy. There are some humorous moments but they teeter on the edge of sadness and sometimes - as in life - actually turn into truly painful events. And yet...not so painful that the movie seems melodramatic.I can see from the other reviews of this movie that many viewers don't share my take. But I've watched this one again and again. It has brought comfort and solace (""A toast to your bravery and a toast to your grief"") as well as plenty of moments that had me reaching for tissues. Perhaps it seems TOO real for some viewers?I have to admit that there was an aspect that seemed unbelievable to me. No matter how rough things got, Eve's house always looked lovely, nearly perfect.

The three play sisters born in that order.  Keaton is the first born so she's got to be the show runner, the one with the big company - a magazine named after...well herself.  Ryan is the middle sister and the one that is running around handling everybody's life for them including their dying father played by Walter Matthau.  Kudrow is the youngest who plays living in the shadow of her older sisters without much responsibility except to her dogs and her soap opera acting career.The movie had potential to become so much better than it was, but with Nora and Delia Ephron at the helms that isn't all that likely.  They tend to make movies in the same vain as Garry Marshall and Rob Reiner.  Cookie cutting fun schlock and for that matter they do a good job of it, every now and then they hit one out of the park.  When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, Julie and Julia.The problem with this one for me was that they threw in a dying father into the equation that would constantly pull the tone of the film ridiculously down, when it should've been climbing to the top.

You're going from sister to sister, scene to scene very quickly.  I didn't have much time to understand what was even going on.  So I decided to give the movie another chance, mostly because Diane Keaton is my favorite actress.  So I did and as I watched, I became more aware of what was going on.  Meg Ryan, Lisa Kudrow, and Diane Keaton all give stunning performances in this movie.  Walter Matthau gave a great performance as the father.  The sad part is, is that this was his final film before he passed away.  Cloris Leachman has a very small part in the movie, but the parts that she is in are quite effective.Many people view this movie as a comedy.  It is definitely not a comedy.  It is a drama.  If you watch closely and really pay attention to what is going on, then you'll see the difference.  Eve (Ryan) is trying to balance her son and husband and caring for her father.  Something that Maddy (Kudrow), a soap star and Georgia (Keaton), the head of a magazine entitled 'Georgia' will not do.  They are too wrapped up in their own lives to come and help care for their dying father.  Yes, the ending is a little predictable, but it is also very touching.

OK, Diane Keaton is waaay too old to play the older sister of Lisa Kudrow, but hey, this happens all the time in theatre, remember the musical &quot;Peter Pan&quot;?Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow and Diane Keaton are all fun and pretty to watch. Problems with the movie are, as many have pointed out, problems with the script: why have a FOREIGN woman be the one with the wisdom? I suspect the simple reason is, &quot;that's how it happened&quot;, because it has dramatic implications that don't seem to have been thought through (Americans are not only maniacally busy, they're also too STUPID and cut off from their roots to know what to do about it). OK, so the Iranian doctor has a cute accent, but is that reason enough to put him AND his mother in a movie? Yes, it's a Meg Ryan vehicle, but I didn't feel that was a drawback. Walter Matthau is funny as always, playing the irascible, unpredictable and irreverent old grouch. But his character has little depth, he's just a foil for the daughters (and I didn't buy the scene where he gatecrashes his grandson's birthday party); he doesn't change or grow, repent or regret anything; age just withers him.The movie is light and what else could a director do with this material but make it a laugh-and-cry comedy? Parents age, grow dotty, and die; when they do, we tend to forget all the bad things and recall only the good; and death brings people together. Nothing earth-shattering there. The real theme of the movie is not aging parents or death, but dealing with stress. We're MEANT to feel irritated by all the phone calls, and stressed by trying to keep track of who is talking to who. Some people feel bound by duty and burn themselves out because they don't know how to say &quot;no&quot;, and Meg is one such person. A very funny scene is when Meg finally twigs, and goes round the house ripping all the phones out - it didn't occur to her that she could simply just stop answering them! And we never see the kind old woman again.Do we really have to see all 3 sisters' faces crying at the death-bed of their father? It would have been just as effective to have them crying off-screen, but no! we have to be shown that ALL 3 are GREAT actresses because they can all equally cry effectively on camera. And Lisa Kudrow has demonstrated time and again in &quot;Friends&quot; that she is excellent at expressing pain and grief with just her face and her body; she doesn't need to be given explicit lines like &quot;I really feel grief and hurt to see my father die&quot;. And why did they have to wear black all the time? Except at the very end when only Meg wore white, why? To show that she has &quot;hung up&quot; but the others haven't learned that life-lesson yet? Or to show that she is the one that broughtthem all together? It jarred a bit because the final scene is all about &quot;sisterhood&quot; and &quot;having fun together&quot;, where egos are finally laid to rest (temporarily). The final shot, drawing back from the 3 sisters goofing around, was very effective - too effective, I felt, for the rest of the movie. It seemed to suggest, &quot;and one day, these 3 laughing spirits will also pass away, as their father has done&quot;, but of course that kind of perspective would have jarred the fluffy, light tone.",3,&quot;Hang up&quot; ... and connect,1000080000,"09 10, 2001",2001,3392,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'upset', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'movie', 'light', 'not', 'deep', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'movies', 'OK', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'waaay', 'too', 'old', 'play', 'older', 'sister', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'hey', 'time', 'theatre', 'remember', 'musical', 'quot', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'quot', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'are', 'fun', 'pretty', 'watch', 'Problems', 'movie', 'are', 'many', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'problems', 'script', 'why', 'have', 'FOREIGN', 'woman', 'be', 'one', 'wisdom', 'suspect', 'simple', 'reason', 'quot', 'how', 'happened', 'quot', 'dramatic', 'implications', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'thought', 'Americans', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'maniacally', 'busy', ""'re"", 'also', 'too', 'STUPID', 'cut', 'off', 'roots', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'OK', 'Iranian', 'doctor', 'cute', 'accent', 'reason', 'enough', 'put', 'AND', 'mother', 'movie', 'Yes', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'vehicle', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'drawback', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'funny', 'always', 'playing', 'irascible', 'unpredictable', 'irreverent', 'old', 'grouch', 'character', 'little', 'depth', 'just', 'foil', 'daughters', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'scene', 'where', 'grandson', 'birthday', 'party', ""n't"", 'change', 'grow', 'repent', 'regret', 'anything', 'age', 'just', 'withers', 'him.The', 'movie', 'light', 'what', 'else', 'could', 'director', 'do', 'material', 'make', 'laugh-and-cry', 'comedy', 'Parents', 'age', 'grow', 'dotty', 'die', 'when', 'do', 'tend', 'forget', 'bad', 'things', 'recall', 'only', 'good', 'death', 'brings', 'people', 'together', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'there', 'real', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'aging', 'parents', 'death', 'dealing', 'stress', ""'re"", 'MEANT', 'feel', 'irritated', 'phone', 'stressed', 'trying', 'keep', 'track', 'who', 'talking', 'who', 'people', 'feel', 'bound', 'duty', 'burn', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'say', 'quot', 'quot', 'Meg', 'one', 'such', 'person', 'very', 'funny', 'scene', 'when', 'Meg', 'finally', 'round', 'house', 'ripping', 'phones', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'occur', 'could', 'simply', 'just', 'stop', 'answering', 'never', 'see', 'kind', 'old', 'woman', 'really', 'have', 'see', '3', 'sisters', 'crying', 'death-bed', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'as', 'effective', 'have', 'crying', 'off-screen', 'have', 'be', 'shown', '3', 'are', 'GREAT', 'actresses', 'can', 'equally', 'cry', 'effectively', 'camera', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'demonstrated', 'time', 'again', 'quot', 'Friends', 'quot', 'excellent', 'expressing', 'pain', 'grief', 'just', 'face', 'body', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'given', 'explicit', 'lines', 'quot', 'really', 'feel', 'grief', 'hurt', 'see', 'father', 'die', 'quot', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'wear', 'black', 'time', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'only', 'Meg', 'wore', 'white', 'why', 'show', 'quot', 'quot', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'learned', 'life-lesson', 'yet', 'show', 'one', 'together', 'jarred', 'bit', 'final', 'scene', 'quot', 'sisterhood', 'quot', 'quot', 'having', 'fun', 'together', 'quot', 'where', 'egos', 'are', 'finally', 'laid', 'rest', 'temporarily', 'final', 'shot', 'drawing', 'back', '3', 'sisters', 'goofing', 'around', 'was', 'very', 'effective', 'too', 'effective', 'felt', 'rest', 'movie', 'seemed', 'suggest', 'quot', 'one', 'day', '3', 'laughing', 'spirits', 'will', 'also', 'pass', 'away', 'father', 'done', 'quot', 'course', 'kind', 'perspective', 'would', 'have', 'jarred', 'fluffy', 'light', 'tone']",N/A

And Meg Ryan is in all of them, with her two sisters played by Lisa Kudrow (who's playing Phoebe once more) and Diane Keaton.The film has every stereotype you could possibly name about a family of sisters. Georgia (Diane Keaton) is a business woman, who runs her own magazine, named after herself, and she's so self-absorbed, she doesn't have time for her family, or her father. Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), the baby of the family, is a ditzy blonde, who stars in a TV show, who doubts herself, and thinks no one takes her seriously. Middle sister Eve (Meg Ryan) sacrifices everything in her life for everyone else, and could possibly losing her husband in the process, but I think most of that sub storyline got deleted. Walter Matthau, in his last film, is an alcoholic, abusive, crude father, who suffers from Alzheimers in his last few years, and tries to chat up his middle daughter.The acting wasn't bad from all the actresses, although the focus is all on Eve, and the other two sisters get sidelined. There's some flashbacks to earlier years, to show the audience what went wrong - and Lisa Kudrow looks like she borrowed one of her wigs from Romy & Michele's High School Reunion!This is very much a girly film, so guys, if your girlfriend says to you she wants a nice night in watching this with you, say you're going down to the pub, and tell her to invite all her friends over for a few bottles of wine.

Walter Matthau plays the almost-senile, maybe alcoholic dad, who one character describes as &quot;commotion man..but not as bad as the Ayotollah though...&quot;  In fact the character who makes this comment is in the scene that epitomizes Keaton's talent with actors.  In this scene Meg Ryan has a quiet chat with &quot;Mrs Kunundar,&quot; mother of the man whose car Ryan has hit, and the scene develops into what is called a &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment that propells the rest of the movie.  Notice the connection these two have in this scene and remember that both are strangers to the other.  Keaton elicits empathy and sympathy out of nothing really except concentrting on the faces and voices of the two chracters.  Heartbreaking.  The biggest weakness I think though is the mother of the girls played by Cloris Leachman who is not given a reasonable excuse, script-wise, to desert her children.  Leachman's speech about &quot;the motherhood thing not taking,&quot; is weak at best and deplorable at worst.

22201,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,076784744X,Michael Butts,"[3, 5]","While watching this film, I found myself irritated with the whining and bickering that goes on, and wondering how it could have been better.  HANGING UP tells the tale of three sisters: Meg Ryan is Eve, the bulwark of the family, runs her own business; Diane Keaton as Georgia has her own self titled magazine; and Lisa Kudrow is Matty, the somewhat vapid soap opera actress.  Their elderly father (Walter Matthau in his last movie role) is having memory problems, can't walk and is admitted to a hospital.  He is going to die.  Ryan is the daughter who is saddled with the responsibility of her father, while the other two are too self-centered to even care.  All of this could have made for a compelling ""dramedy"" but director Keaton allows over emoting and all that conflict to override the gentler side of losing a parent.  And Matthau is not all that likeable either.  Cloris Leachman has a brief appearance as his ex-wife and Adam Arkin is Ryan's globetrotting husband.  It's surprising that the most honest moment in the film comes in a brief sequence between Ryan and the mother of a doctor whose car she crashed into in the hospital parking garage.  Ryan tries gamely to hold the movie together and although she is quite good, she can't really salvage the film.  Keaton and Kudrow are both adequate, but no depth is observed.  Matthau is more like Matthau than a true character and it's sad that his last role is so unlikeable.

The story involves three sisters (one has her own magazine (Diane Keaton), one is a soap opera actress (Lisa Kudrow), and the other (Meg Ryan) whom has a more everyday career, she also is the one sister that seems to care the most about her family. Walter Matthau (last movie I think) plays the ill father who Meg Ryan visits frequently at the hospital, despite little to no visits from the other two sisters. If nothing else, HANGING UP taught me that sometimes in life, in order to make it.. you must simply hang it up. When life seems to be non-stop.. family, friends, work, school, daycare, cooking, cleaning, driving, yard work, doctor visits, ect.. Wouldn't it be nice to have a pause button on life. Sometimes we all need to stop and live a little. HANGING UP may have ended up being known as one of Meg Ryan's weaker chick flicks, but I'd say it's a bit more than that.

The previews were better.  I really wanted to like this movie because of the actors that were in it.  But I just couldn't.  In fact, instead of relaxing watching this movie, I felt more stressed afterwards.Hanging Up is the story of three sisters, and their father who is slowly losing his hold on reality.  What turns from alcoholism to dementia is a sign that Eve, Georgia, and Maddy's father is not the loving person he used to be.  While Georgia is off promoting her magazine and Maddy a busy soapstar, Eve is left to try to pick up the pieces and care for her father.  She is pretty devoted to him and the movie is interspersed with memories of the family, and especially memories of her and him.Characters:Meg Ryan: Eve Mozell MarksDiane Keaton: Georgia MozellLisa Kudrow: Maddy MozellWalter Matthau: Lou MozellAdam Arkin: Joe MarksShaun Duke: Dr. Omar KunundarAnn Bortolotti: Ogmed KunundarFor such great actors in a movie, this film was a mess.  I didn't find any of the characters likable except for maybe the Kunundars.  And even they were slightly unbelievable.  Eve drove me crazy and was so busy hopping around and yelling and just in general providing crazed confusion that I could feel my stress levels rise as I watched.  Maddy and Georgia were unsympathetic to Eve's plight and pretty selfish and when all three were together and fighting I felt the stress come on then too.  Dysfunctional is putting it lightly.  Walter Matthau did a pretty good job mainly because he was uncomfortable to watch which is very realistic since people with dementia do some uncomfortable things.The plot was actually pretty decent and heartfelt.  If it hadn't of been for the scripting I might have really enjoyed it.  Thinking about the future loss of a loved one is never easy and people can begin to grieve even before the person is gone, and I think this movie reflected that aspect well.  But the dialogue and lousy characters had to go right in and ruin that aspect of the movie for me.  There were no special effects and the music was just background, so the whole movie had to be held up by just the plot along and unfortunately it just wasn't there.Not a movie I'd recommend by any means.  There was just so much that went wrong that could have been done so right.  That being said, my mom who watched it with me seemed to like it and cried quite a few times.  But this is the same woman whose cried at a Budweiser commercial so I'm not sure how reliable a gauge that is.Review by M.

As someone once said: ""We don't realize how much we miss them until they are gone. And then we miss them terribly!""For women facing these issues, this movie could be a healing experience and they might realize they need to focus on the important part of life.What I found disturbing was the scenes were Meg wakes up thinking her father has died. She is obsessed with his death and it seemed a bit insensitive and disconnected.There are no spiritual solutions. No faith. The only semi-spiritual solution seems to be to disconnect from life instead of connecting with God and family to help you get through the problems. Eve's mother has left her father and so she is not there to help her daughters. She is completely insensitive to their needs.Eve doesn't have a mom to give her any wisdom or comfort or say: ""You will see your Father again, honey."" If a movie is going to deal with death, they should also deal with some of the issues of what happens when we die. The issues of what we believe in here on earth and how that affects us in the next life. It is a real pity the script writers put in so much crudeness and not enough comfort. In a movie dealing with such an important and emotional issue, there is hardly any room for comedy. In fact, this is a drama for the most part. Why they try to sell this as a comedy is beyond me.Eve (Meg Ryan) is definitely not in control of her life. She is trying to deal with her father dying and still keep her job a top priority. Her two sisters are very successful, yet have little time for their father. Eve takes most of the responsibilities and finally feels she is being taken advantage of by Georgia (Diane Keaton) and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow).An emotional movie that does still have a point: No life is without influence. It either sheds light or casts a shadow. Only Jesus Christ could solve the problems presented in this movie. His love can make life so much more worthwhile and the characters don't seem to have much worth living for.Since I recently lost my grandmother, I know the fears we have, the pain during our period of loss and yet, I know she is in heaven and that is a great blessing. I don't feel like I lost her, but that my grandfather found her again. Being a Christian gives me such peace and I think Eve would have handled situations differently if she could have been able to pray now and then for the strength she obviously needed.She was so very alone.~The Rebecca Review",3,Calling on your Inner Strength,1011139200,"01 16, 2002",2002,2567,"['movie', 'had', 'weak', 'moments', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'how', 'feel', 'own', 'mortality', 'death', 'parents', 'someone', 'once', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'miss', 'are', 'gone', 'then', 'miss', 'terribly', 'women', 'facing', 'issues', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'healing', 'experience', 'might', 'realize', 'need', 'focus', 'important', 'part', 'life.What', 'found', 'disturbing', 'was', 'scenes', 'were', 'Meg', 'up', 'thinking', 'father', 'died', 'obsessed', 'death', 'seemed', 'bit', 'insensitive', 'are', 'spiritual', 'solutions', 'faith', 'only', 'semi-spiritual', 'solution', 'be', 'disconnect', 'life', 'instead', 'connecting', 'God', 'family', 'help', 'get', 'problems', 'Eve', 'mother', 'left', 'father', 'so', 'not', 'there', 'help', 'daughters', 'completely', 'insensitive', 'needs.Eve', ""n't"", 'have', 'mom', 'give', 'wisdom', 'comfort', 'say', 'will', 'see', 'Father', 'again', 'honey', 'movie', 'going', 'deal', 'death', 'should', 'also', 'deal', 'issues', 'what', 'when', 'die', 'issues', 'what', 'believe', 'here', 'earth', 'how', 'next', 'life', 'real', 'pity', 'script', 'writers', 'put', 'so', 'much', 'crudeness', 'not', 'enough', 'comfort', 'movie', 'dealing', 'important', 'emotional', 'issue', 'hardly', 'room', 'comedy', 'fact', 'drama', 'most', 'part', 'Why', 'try', 'sell', 'comedy', 'me.Eve', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'definitely', 'not', 'control', 'life', 'trying', 'deal', 'father', 'dying', 'still', 'keep', 'job', 'top', 'priority', 'two', 'sisters', 'are', 'very', 'successful', 'yet', 'have', 'little', 'time', 'father', 'Eve', 'most', 'responsibilities', 'finally', 'feels', 'being', 'taken', 'advantage', 'Georgia', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Maddy', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', '.An', 'emotional', 'movie', 'still', 'have', 'point', 'life', 'influence', 'sheds', 'light', 'shadow', 'Only', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'could', 'solve', 'problems', 'presented', 'movie', 'love', 'can', 'make', 'life', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'living', 'for.Since', 'recently', 'lost', 'grandmother', 'know', 'fears', 'have', 'pain', 'period', 'loss', 'yet', 'know', 'heaven', 'great', 'blessing', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'lost', 'grandfather', 'found', 'again', 'Being', 'Christian', 'such', 'peace', 'think', 'Eve', 'would', 'have', 'handled', 'situations', 'differently', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pray', 'now', 'then', 'strength', 'obviously', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'alone.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",N/A

22209,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,076784744X,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 3]","The late Walter Matthau ended his long and illustrious career as a film actor in ""Hanging Up,"" playing, appropriately, the dying father of three adult daughters.  I wish I could say that the vehicle he chose as his eventual swan song were one truly worthy of his enormous skill and talent.  Unfortunately - or rather fortunately - however, this will not be the film for which he is most remembered.Like so many films, ""Hanging Up"" starts off with the most noble of intentions.  Writer Delia Ephron and director Diane Keaton have attempted to come to terms with the most complex issue facing the aging baby boomer generation:  how does one cope with ailing, aging and dying parents while trying to keep a grip on one's own hectic life and personal commitments?  And, to make matters more complicated, how does one expend the physical and emotional energy needed for such a task when the parent himself is often irascible, crusty and even downright unlikable in his behavior and nature?  And, finally, how does a wounded child ultimately find it in his or her heart to forgive the parent and arrive at that moment of reconciliation so crucial when death finally comes?When ""Hanging Up"" focuses on this theme, it achieves moments of point and relevance.  All of us can identify with the main character, Eve (Meg Ryan), a sweet, warmhearted young woman who, alone of the three daughters, has unflaggingly dedicated herself to the care of a father who, more often than not, strikes out at her in unappreciative scorn and anger.  Wearied and harassed by the enormous burdens of her hectic life and her own inability to say ""no"" to the people who demand so much from her, Eve emerges as a truly winning and believable character.  Unfortunately, her two sisters, Georgia (Diane Keaton), a magazine magnate, and Maddy (Lisa Kudrow), a soap opera actress, come across as shallow, two-dimensional characters whose self-absorption and seeming indifference are (ho hum) really masks for the insecurity and hurt hidden deep beneath their composed surfaces.Somehow, however, for all its attempts to deal with a truly universal theme, ""Hanging Up"" never seems quite real in its look and demeanor - it always feels like a movie.  Maybe it is the overall slickness of the approach that undermines the seriousness of the drama.  The actresses, good though they are, seem somehow too glamorous, their careers too unrepresentative of most of the people in the audience.  Another problem is that the film can never seem to settle on an appropriate tone.  One moment we find ourselves steeped in searing drama followed the next by a scene of trivial slapstick.  Time and again, Ryan is forced to trip over a discarded toy, tangle with an overgrown mutt or bang away at an uncooperative coffee dispenser.  Such incidents end up reducing the level of the drama to little more than sitcom status.""Hanging Up"" has, however, been blessed with a wonderful cast.  Ryan, Keaton, Kudrow and Matthau pore on the charm and play off each other nicely.  (And the film has some devilish fun playing up the physical similarities between Matthau and Richard Nixon).  These fine performers obviously had a terrific time making the film together.  That is why one regrets the fact, that for all their hard work, the film they left behind is so lacking in credibility and grit.

22211,ANHGGQT4HTEK0,076784744X,Sonia,"[4, 6]","In Hanging Up, the phone is the umbilical cord for the family in this story, three sisters and their dear old dad.  While Hanging Up was touted as a comedy, at least that's the impression I got, I'm hard pressed to remember much about it that was funny, it's a drama if ever there was one.We meet Eve, played by the effervescent Meg Ryan, the overwhelmed middle sister in a family of driven, slightly neurotic individuals.  Oldest sister, Georgia (Diane Keaton who also directs) is typical oldest child, overachiever material with her own Vogue-esqe magazine, named Georgia.  Youngest sister Maddy is a somewhat spoiled soap opera star played to whiney perfection by Lisa Kudrow.  Last but not least, is the dying father, Lou, with the ever-grumpy and inappropriate Walter Matthau at the helm.The film has woven together the present with a series of flashbacks to Eve's childhood as well as flashbacks during her time with her father in her adult life.  Amidst all the flashbacks, is the busy, crazed daily routine of party planner Eve and her attempt to understand what is happening to her father.  She must also deal with a level of resentment towards her sisters for being an interruption into her life with all their phone calls, but not being a shoulder to lean on for her where their father is concerned.Hanging Up does a great job demonstrating just how stressed out people can get.  There is regular day-to-day stress and then there is the stress you bring on yourself purely because of a basic personality flaw.  I have firsthand knowledge of making stress out of things that don't have to be stressful.  First ulcer at age fourteen, thank you very much.  I can understand Meg Ryan's character and her propensity for making mountains out of molehills.The most rewarding thing about watching a character like that is watching the ""change"".  Let's not forget, folks, in a movie, the main character usually makes a personal change, has an epiphany, changes their life, or ends a destructive pattern.  What is drama?  Putting an ordinary person in extraordinary circumstances.  What Eve does early on in the film is reach a level of frustration that is so high she makes a scene in the middle of a hospital corridor.Why is that so entertaining?  Because she sort of freaks out and that's something regular people WANT to do, but CAN'T because we behave within the confines of societal norms.  If I'm having a bad day, and I am in the middle of St. Anthony's and start yelling and flailing my arms, someone is gonna drag me to the fourth floor.  In the movies you can scream and act like an idiot, in real life people look at you and say, ""the cheese has slipped off her cracker"".Despite the frenetic pace of Eve's day to day routine and the frequent flashbacks, Hanging Up lacks the same gusto in its attempt to impact the viewer with the seriousness of a dying parent.  Matthau's character seems to be little more than window-dressing with his scenes all virtually being nothing more than one-liners from the confines of his wheelchair or hospital bed.  I guess I feel a dying parent would be a more significant story factor here than it seemed to be.While I admit to becoming a little misty from time to time during the film, I was looking for gut-wrenching Terms of Endearment stuff.  Hanging Up fell a little short for me but I'm sure people to whom a similar situation has happened may have a stronger emotional reaction.However, there are two instances where Hanging Up was borderline daring, dealing with subject matter that I have seen little of, if ever.  There is an obvious rift between Eve and her mother, from whom Lou was divorced many years before.  We are given a taste of Eve's view of her mother from the flashback scenes, but the real drama comes when, in one of the flashback scenes Eve pays her mother a visit.Eve goes to her mother (Cloris Leachman) to plead for her to return home because her father is so unhappy.  Aside from that being a difficult confrontation for anyone to deal with, is the revelation that she's not all that satisfied with being a mother in the first place.  Other girls couldn't wait to grow up and become mommies, so she thought she did too and it didn't take.  The thought of hearing that coming out of a mother's mouth is almost like a kick in the stomach, which is exactly the reaction Ryan's character seemed to have.  Talk about taboo, admitting to your child you wish you weren't a mother.  Somebody call Jerry Springer, next topic, ""I Wish You Were Never Born"".Another explosive element is the basis of the father's illness.  His memory and clarity are more off than on.  The sadness of a person slowly losing their mind, slowly forgetting everyone and everything dear to them is pathetic and emotionally charged.  Hanging Up touches on this hopelessness in a moment of confusion, when Matthau's character confuses his daughter with someone else he used to know and basically, is hitting on her.  Eve has to remind him that she's his daughter, not this other person and he becomes angry, stating he doesn't have any daughters.  It's icky.  But sometimes life is icky and this scene is a blatant reminder of just how icky things can get.Hanging Up finally gets its message across when Ryan's character must basically get a grip and learn when to say when.  She can't be superwoman, bearing the responsibility of what is happening to her father all by herself.  I must also stress the importance of the sister relationships to the film as well, which I have no understanding of either since I have four younger brothers.  I always wanted a sister, but with all those brothers, what I got instead was my own room.  Women with sisters may take more away from this movie than any other viewer.  Hanging Up isn't for some, great for others.  This is one where your own life's experiences will impact your perspective on the film.",3,Subject matter meaningful for some...not for all,970358400,"10 1, 2000",2000,5883,"['Hanging', 'Up', 'phone',

22213,A1J9SUX6DLLADK,076784744X,ubalu,"[1, 1]","This film is listed as comedy, but it is anything but that.  There is nothing funny about an ailing elderly senile father and the struggle he and his daughter Eve go through. Eve takes upon herself the responsibilities of her two selfish sisters who are either in denial or avoidance. They are not only unhelpful, but dump more work on her. Eve desperately tries to keep the peace. The stress she is put through is not comedy; it is pure, needless pressure.The storyline is great, but executed poorly. If written and directed differently, this could have been a successful, moving drama which the audience can identify with and sympathize.Some of the interesting dialogues are about the emotional history of the family, what happened between the parents, why the mother disappeared, and the struggles each child went through, for example, the youngest girl states that she is tired of always being treated as the little one. There are many such hints, and touching flashbacks, which add to the power of the drama.The movie is a bit successful because of Walter Mathau and Meg Ryan who have done the best they can with a mediocre script.

The issue of one child being left to care for an ailing parent, while the other selfish siblings are heard from only if things aren't going their way, is an issue with which I'm sure many people have to deal.In this movie, Meg Ryan plays the one that gets all the work and none of the credit. She does just a wonderful job, as does Walter Matthau as the father suffering from Alzheimer's disease.Though I might question some of the casting, based on ages of the actors (17 years difference between the oldest and youngest children!), even Kudrow and Keaton play their parts well...as spoiled, self centered siblings.I believe what may be a turn-off to some is the presence of TOO MANY obnoxious personalities. The movie would have been much better without the presence of Adam Arkin's or Jesse James's characters...and I probably would have felt more sympathy for Meg Ryan's character as well.Though the movie was far from perfect, there were some emotional moments in the movie that made up for its shortcomings.I think the biggest problem with the story line was the unrealistic unity of the sisters at the end of the movie. Self-centered individuals do not suddenly change their ways. Had Meg's character gone on her way, leaving the sisters to SEE the error of their ways, it would have been a much more effective ending.As for the transfer....as usual, a fantastic anamorphic widescreen picture from Columbia. The special features are not great, but certainly more than one gets on most basic DVD's.In the end, I would say this is an enjoyable...though not completely fulfilling movie. It could have been better, but it is definitely worth a rental...or if you can find it in the bargain bin as I did....a cheap purchase.{As an added challenge....see if you can recognize the film error as the cars are racing to the hospital toward the end of the movie.)",3,Better than the critics would have you believe,1087344000,"06 16, 2004",2004,1967,"['critics', 'really', 'hated', 'movie', 'found', 'premise', 'one', 'really', 'deserved', 'addressing', 'issue', 'one', 'child', 'being', 'left', 'care', 'ailing', 'parent', 'other', 'selfish', 'siblings', 'are', 'heard', 'only', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'way', 'issue', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'deal.In', 'movie', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'one', 'work', 'none', 'credit', 'just', 'wonderful', 'job', 'Walter', 'Matthau', 'father', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'disease.Though', 'might', 'question', 'casting', 'based', 'ages', 'actors', '17', 'years', 'difference', 'oldest', 'youngest', 'children', 'even', 'Kudrow', 'Keaton', 'play', 'parts', 'well', 'spoiled', 'centered', 'siblings.I', 'believe', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'turn-off', 'presence', 'TOO', 'MANY', 'obnoxious', 'personalities', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'presence', 'Adam', 'Arkin', 'Jesse', 'James', 'characters', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'more', 'sympathy', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'were', 'emotional', 'moments', 'movie', 'made', 'up', 'shortcomings.I', 'think', 'biggest', 'problem', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'unity', 'sisters', 'end', 'movie', 'Self-centered', 'individuals', 'do', 'not', 'suddenly', 'change', 'ways', 'Had', 'Meg', 'character', 'gone', 'way', 'leaving', 'sisters', 'SEE', 'error', 'ways', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'effective', 'ending.As', 'transfer', '.as', 'usual', 'fantastic', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'picture', 'Columbia', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'more', 'one', 'most', 'basic', ""DVD's.In"", 'end', 'would', 'say', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'completely', 'fulfilling', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'definitely', 'worth', 'rental', 'can', 'find', 'bargain', 'bin', 'did', '.a', 'cheap', 'purchase', 'added', 'challenge', '.see', 'can', 'recognize', 'film', 'error', 'cars', 'are', 'racing', 'hospital', 'end', 'movie']",N/A
