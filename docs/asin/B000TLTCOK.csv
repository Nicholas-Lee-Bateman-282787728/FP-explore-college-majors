If they were going to do the first season in 2 parts they should have put them in order with the original airdates. Also they don't arrange them in chapters by episodes.

But I have to admit that I'd totally forgotten about it, until I ran across a reference to the new DVDs online. Forty-year old memories can be a little fuzzy, so before I bought the DVDs I rented. And this was one childhood show that's held up nicely--funny, lively, entertaining. The stories are engaging, there's plenty of action and lots of hilarious situations that the three Texas Rangers get themselves into. Gravel-voice Neville Brand is the heart and soul of the show--usually typecast as a heavy, here he's first-rate comic relief.

I enjoyed them thoroughy and you will also. Laredo combined action and humor with the focus on three fictitious Texas Rangers. Reese Bennett, played by Brand, is older than his two partners. Chad Cooper was played by Peter Brown, the former co-star of NBC's Lawman. Joe Riley was portrayed by William Smith. Reese was previously an officer of the Union Army during the American Civil War. Originally from New Orleans, Chad was in the Border Patrol during the war. He joined the Rangers to search for the gunrunners who had ambushed fellow border patrolmen. Joe was a gunfighter who was at times on the wrong side of the law. He joined the Rangers to obtain protection from a sheriff. Chad and Joe tease Reese about his age: he was in his forties.The three Rangers are led by Captain Edward Parmalee, played by Philip Carey, who was stern and disciplined. Robert Wolders as Erik Hunter joined the show in the second and final season. Claude Akins played Ranger Cotton Buckmeister in five episodes but never became a part of the cast. The pilot of Laredo was an episode of The Virginian called ""We've Lost A Train"", which was broadcast in April 1965. It was released theatrically in 1969 under the title Backtrack.Reese's horse Cactus is mentioned in several episodes. Chad's horse called ""Amigo"" was actually Peter Brown's personal horse.Three of the episodes from the first season of the series were edited into the feature film Three Guns for Texas",5,A GREAT WESTERN FOR ITS TIME,1227484800,"11 24, 2008",2008,1514,"['remember', 'watching', 'shows', 'brothers', 'late', 'night', 'enjoyed', 'thoroughy', 'will', 'also', 'Laredo', 'combined', 'action', 'humor', 'focus', 'three', 'fictitious', 'Texas', 'Rangers', 'Reese', 'Bennett', 'played', 'Brand', 'older', 'two', 'partners', 'Chad', 'Cooper', 'was', 'played', 'Peter', 'Brown', 'former', 'co-star', 'NBC', 'Lawman', 'Joe', 'Riley', 'was', 'portrayed', 'William', 'Smith', 'Reese', 'was', 'previously', 'officer', 'Union', 'Army', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'Originally', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Chad', 'was', 'Border', 'Patrol', 'war', 'joined', 'Rangers', 'search', 'gunrunners', 'who', 'had', 'ambushed', 'fellow', 'border', 'patrolmen', 'Joe', 'was', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'was', 'times', 'wrong', 'side', 'law', 'joined', 'Rangers', 'obtain', 'protection', 'sheriff', 'Chad', 'Joe', 'tease', 'Reese', 'age', 'was', 'forties.The', 'three', 'Rangers', 'are', 'led', 'Captain', 'Edward', 'Parmalee', 'played', 'Philip', 'Carey', 'who', 'was', 'stern', 'disciplined', 'Robert', 'Wolders', 'Erik', 'Hunter', 'joined', 'show', 'second', 'final', 'season', 'Claude', 'Akins', 'played', 'Ranger', 'Cotton', 'Buckmeister', 'five', 'episodes', 'never', 'became', 'part', 'cast', 'pilot', 'Laredo', 'was', 'episode', 'Virginian', 'called', ""'ve"", 'Lost', 'Train', 'was', 'broadcast', 'April', '1965', 'was', 'released', 'theatrically', '1969', 'title', 'Backtrack.Reese', 'horse', 'Cactus', 'mentioned', 'several', 'episodes', 'Chad', 'horse', 'called', 'Amigo', 'was', 'actually', 'Peter', 'Brown', 'personal', 'horse.Three', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'series', 'were', 'edited', 'feature', 'film', 'Three', 'Guns', 'Texas']",Best of Laredo: Season 1
