Fairbanks""","[8, 10]","Boyhood pals Rock Hudson and Dean Martin grow up to live on opposite sides of the law in this entertaining Western that is a sort of variation on the  theme of 1938's &quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; with Martin taking over  for James Cagney and Hudson stepping in for Pat O' Brien.  Although, like a  lot of Universal &quot;product&quot; at the time, it has TV stamped all  over it (and both of the stars were headlining NBC shows during this  period), and it was probably intended as nothing more than a fulfillment of  a feature film clause in Hudson's &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot; contract  with the studio, it somehow reaches beyond its modest beginnings to become  something a little deeper and of higher quality than was perhaps intended.",3,&quot;Angels With Dirty Faces&quot; out west,927244800,"05 21, 1999",1999,749,"['Boyhood', 'pals', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'grow', 'up', 'live', 'opposite', 'sides', 'law', 'entertaining', 'Western', 'sort', 'variation', 'theme', '1938', 'quot', 'Angels', 'Dirty', 'Faces', 'quot', 'Martin', 'taking', 'over', 'James', 'Cagney', 'Hudson', 'stepping', 'Pat', 'O', 'Brien', 'lot', 'Universal', 'quot', 'product', 'quot', 'time', 'TV', 'stamped', 'stars', 'were', 'headlining', 'NBC', 'shows', 'period', 'was', 'probably', 'intended', 'nothing', 'more', 'fulfillment', 'feature', 'film', 'clause', 'Hudson', 'quot', 'McMillan', 'Wife', 'quot', 'contract', 'studio', 'somehow', 'modest', 'beginnings', 'become', 'something', 'little', 'deeper', 'higher', 'quality', 'was', 'perhaps', 'intended']",N/A

Several years later, Hudson becomes the town sheriff, while Martin deteriorated as a drunk and robber. But, as is usual in his films, Martin is very likable, at least to most people.The film opens with Martin and three fellows robbing a train. Martin didn't know that his friend was the local sheriff. When the five thieves are alone, Martin robs the four of the money from the heist, and kills one in self defense. Conscientious and mustached Hudson, who is so tall in this film that he has to duck when he moves from room to room, reluctantly goes after his friend to bring him to justice. He turns down a posse, afraid that one of the posse will kill Martin. Instead he takes trackers with him, Indians who are also friends from youth, who also like Martin. Now Martin is pursued by Hudson and his trackers and the three remaining thieves who are furious.Hudson catches Martin and the two concoct a story that makes Martin a hero: he took the money from the other robbers to return it to the town people. Martin is kept in jail waiting trail and talks Hudson into leaving town for a second honeymoon. While Hudson is out of town, the local prosecutor tells Martin that he can forget about the concocted story; he is going to make sure that Martin hangs.This is a nice well acted tale of friendship, told against splendid scenery. Will Martin escape? Will Hudson go after him again? Will he catch him again? How can he save him this time? Will the other robbers catch up with Martin? What will happen if they do?",5,How long can friendship last?,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,1744,"['Two', 'charismatic', 'men', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'act', 'very', 'well', 'film', 'two', 'friends', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'together', 'always', 'helped', 'one', 'other', 'bought', 'ranch', 'together', 'did', 'nothing', 'apart', 'Hudson', 'married', 'Martin', 'left', 'town', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'Hudson', 'town', 'sheriff', 'Martin', 'deteriorated', 'drunk', 'robber', 'usual', 'films', 'Martin', 'very', 'likable', 'least', 'most', 'people.The', 'film', 'Martin', 'three', 'fellows', 'robbing', 'train', 'Martin', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'friend', 'was', 'local', 'sheriff', 'When', 'five', 'thieves', 'are', 'alone', 'Martin', 'four', 'money', 'heist', 'one', 'self', 'defense', 'Conscientious', 'mustached', 'Hudson', 'who', 'so', 'tall', 'film', 'duck', 'when', 'room', 'room', 'reluctantly', 'friend', 'bring', 'justice', 'down', 'posse', 'afraid', 'one', 'posse', 'will', 'kill', 'Martin', 'Instead', 'trackers', 'Indians', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'friends', 'youth', 'who', 'also', 'like', 'Martin', 'Now', 'Martin', 'pursued', 'Hudson', 'trackers', 'three', 'remaining', 'thieves', 'who', 'are', 'furious.Hudson', 'catches', 'Martin', 'two', 'concoct', 'story', 'Martin', 'hero', 'took', 'money', 'other', 'robbers', 'return', 'town', 'people', 'Martin', 'kept', 'jail', 'waiting', 'trail', 'talks', 'Hudson', 'leaving', 'town', 'second', 'honeymoon', 'Hudson', 'town', 'local', 'prosecutor', 'tells', 'Martin', 'can', 'forget', 'concocted', 'story', 'going', 'make', 'sure', 'Martin', 'hangs.This', 'nice', 'well', 'acted', 'tale', 'friendship', 'told', 'splendid', 'scenery', 'Will', 'Martin', 'escape', 'Will', 'Hudson', 'go', 'again', 'Will', 'catch', 'again', 'How', 'can', 'save', 'time', 'Will', 'other', 'robbers', 'catch', 'up', 'Martin', 'What', 'will', 'happen', 'do']",N/A
