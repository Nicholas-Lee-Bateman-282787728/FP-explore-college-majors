1183716,A315BRWZLUPBUZ,B001DZOC3W,"A Bookworm's Review ""Quiet One""","[12, 15]","This film should get no stars.  I've enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan other movies, yeah they can be a bit off the wall but it kept me entertain and think about the message that I would get out of the film.  Yes this movie has a messeage as well, I mean natural unexplainable occurrences do happen but he should have delivered it in a different way. It's pretty bad when you are walking out the theater and people back of you and in front of you are saying what a dumb movie it was.  So for date night my husband and I decided to watch this movie over the new Indy film.  Since it had an R rated we expected M. Night Shyamalan to deliver a really good scary flick.  At credits we sat there like this is it.  He revealed the reason (I'm not going to give it away) why ""the happening"" was happening way too soon in the film.  The only reason why this film had a R rating is because of blood (mind you some scenes like the zoo scene didn't even look real- you can tell they were fake arms).  Not to mention that my husband and I like Mark Wahlberg (and since we are movie buffs we got a kick out of the idea that Mark's brother Donnie was in The Sixth Sense- kind of like a family affair type of thing), it was just a let down.  I will say that in the first scene it does capture your attention (seeing people freeze and than killing themselves) but at the end it just didn't live up to our expectations. One thing I always liked about M. Night Shyamalan films is there is some kind of twist at the end.  This film does not have that.  We have all of  M. Night Shyamalan on DVD at the moment but when The Happening gets released on DVD we will not buy this one. So disappointed.  If you want to see a good M. Night Shyamalan movie watch The Sixth Sense or Signs.",1,Disappointing,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1753,"['film', 'should', 'get', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'other', 'movies', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'wall', 'kept', 'entertain', 'think', 'message', 'would', 'get', 'film', 'Yes', 'movie', 'messeage', 'as', 'well', 'mean', 'natural', 'unexplainable', 'occurrences', 'do', 'happen', 'should', 'have', 'delivered', 'different', 'way', 'pretty', 'bad', 'when', 'are', 'walking', 'out', 'theater', 'people', 'back', 'front', 'are', 'saying', 'what', 'dumb', 'movie', 'was', 'So', 'date', 'night', 'husband', 'decided', 'watch', 'movie', 'new', 'Indy', 'film', 'had', 'R', 'rated', 'expected', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'deliver', 'really', 'good', 'scary', 'flick', 'credits', 'sat', 'revealed', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'give', 'away', 'why', 'happening', 'was', 'happening', 'way', 'too', 'soon', 'film', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'had', 'R', 'rating', 'blood', 'scenes', 'zoo', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'look', 'real-', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'fake', 'arms', 'Not', 'mention', 'husband', 'like', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'movie', 'got', 'kick', 'idea', 'Mark', 'brother', 'Donnie', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense-', 'kind', 'family', 'affair', 'type', 'thing', 'was', 'just', 'let', 'down', 'will', 'say', 'first', 'scene', 'capture', 'attention', 'seeing', 'people', 'freeze', 'killing', 'end', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 'One', 'thing', 'always', 'liked', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'kind', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'have', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'DVD', 'moment', 'when', 'Happening', 'released', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'buy', 'one', 'So', 'disappointed', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'watch', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs']",N/A
1183717,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001DZOC3W,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[5, 7]","I won't deny this film got terrible reviews from critics and customers of this site, but I thought this movie was actually good and I believe it didn't deserve some of the criticism it got. I've watched a lot of M. Night Shyamalan films like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, and Lady in the Water and enjoyed them all, and I liked this movie.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: It begins in Central Park in New York, whenever a strange wind blows people stop like their frozen in time and then kill themselves. Jumping off buildings, shooting themselves, stabbing themselves, the works. Then it begins moving to small towns, roads, and eventually to even the most deserted places across the eastern states. This phenomenon is caused by plants that give off a strange chemical which causes people to harm themselves in some way because the plants are angry and wanting to get back at humans. It's mostly centered around a group of survivors from New Jersey; a man and his wife, and a little girl are the main characters who try to survive this occurrence. The story may be flawed, but it does a decent job of putting itself together, and it's definitely M. Night Shyamalan because of how bizarre the film is.MUSIC: The music is great and really nows how to fit the atmosphere and mood of this movie.DISTURBING FACTOR: Most of the ways people get killed in this movie are things I've already seen, but some scenes flatout shocked me like the part where the two boys get killed in the movie unexpectedly. Some of the deaths are shocking in this movie, but it's not very disturbing overall.ACTING: The acting is generally good, though I did notice some sequences of cheesy acting. The dialogue is nicely assembled at least and adds to the film's creepy value.ENTERTAINMENT: I don't know about you, but I found this movie to be rather entertaining and interesting. It mostly depends on how willing are you to take chances with a film that got bad reviews from critics? The acting in this movie is good, the dialogue is good, the creepy factor is good, and the music is great. A highly entertaining and underrated film.OVERALL: Approach with caution, rent before buy. This film is not for everyone and there is a deep divide between people who think it's good and people who think it sucks. Be warned.THE GOOD: Good acting, great music, good creepy factor, good dialogue, interesting premise for a story.THE BAD: Story is flawed and sometimes stupid, some acting sequences were cheesy, and the film is sometimes too weird for its own good.",4,"UNDERRATED, UNDERAPPRECIATED  8.5 OUT OF 10",1219881600,"08 28, 2008",2008,2518,"['wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'film', 'got', 'terrible', 'reviews', 'critics', 'customers', 'site', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'actually', 'good', 'believe', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'criticism', 'got', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'lot', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'Village', 'Lady', 'Water', 'enjoyed', 'liked', 'movie.WHAT', 'IT', 'Central', 'Park', 'New', 'York', 'whenever', 'strange', 'wind', 'people', 'stop', 'frozen', 'time', 'then', 'kill', 'Jumping', 'off', 'buildings', 'shooting', 'stabbing', 'works', 'Then', 'moving', 'small', 'towns', 'roads', 'eventually', 'even', 'most', 'deserted', 'places', 'eastern', 'states', 'phenomenon', 'caused', 'plants', 'give', 'off', 'strange', 'chemical', 'people', 'harm', 'way', 'plants', 'are', 'angry', 'wanting', 'get', 'back', 'humans', 'mostly', 'centered', 'group', 'survivors', 'New', 'Jersey', 'man', 'wife', 'little', 'girl', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'who', 'try', 'survive', 'occurrence', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'flawed', 'decent', 'job', 'putting', 'together', 'definitely', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'how', 'bizarre', 'film', 'is.MUSIC', 'music', 'great', 'really', 'how', 'fit', 'atmosphere', 'mood', 'movie.DISTURBING', 'FACTOR', 'Most', 'ways', 'people', 'get', 'killed', 'movie', 'are', 'things', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'scenes', 'shocked', 'part', 'where', 'two', 'boys', 'get', 'killed', 'movie', 'unexpectedly', 'deaths', 'are', 'shocking', 'movie', 'not', 'very', 'disturbing', 'overall.ACTING', 'acting', 'generally', 'good', 'did', 'notice', 'sequences', 'cheesy', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'nicely', 'assembled', 'least', 'film', 'creepy', 'value.ENTERTAINMENT', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'mostly', 'how', 'willing', 'are', 'take', 'chances', 'film', 'got', 'bad', 'reviews', 'critics', 'acting', 'movie', 'good', 'dialogue', 'good', 'creepy', 'factor', 'good', 'music', 'great', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'underrated', 'film.OVERALL', 'Approach', 'caution', 'rent', 'buy', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'deep', 'divide', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'good', 'people', 'who', 'think', 'Be', 'warned.THE', 'GOOD', 'Good', 'acting', 'great', 'music', 'good', 'creepy', 'factor', 'good', 'dialogue', 'interesting', 'premise', 'story.THE', 'BAD', 'Story', 'flawed', 'sometimes', 'stupid', 'acting', 'sequences', 'were', 'cheesy', 'film', 'sometimes', 'too', 'weird', 'own', 'good']",N/A
1183718,A3KUP8IQ3JMS0P,B001DZOC3W,Acid,"[1, 5]","This is not some high minded, auteur film. It's a horror movie, plain and simple. It's not a message movie any more than ""The Birds"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"" (two classic horror movies that were an obvious influence) were message films. The global warming ""message"" which critics and M. Night haters claimed was so hackneyed is nothing more than a plot point, a means of creating the situation that the characters find themselves in. The acting is not always convincing; there are a few awkwardly over-acted scenes during the slow moments, but for the most part it is perfectly adequate and, at it's creepiest moments, spot-on scary. The dialogue is a lot more tongue-in-cheek than most people give it credit for, and I found myself laughing quite a bit. That was an intentional attempt at lightening the mood. After all, it's otherwise extremely dark, with very disturbing violence. It is not a subtle film, but who ever claimed that a horror movie had to be subtle to be good?I think people have come to expect a very specific thing from M. Night's films. If they get what they expected, they complain about how obvious it was (""The Village""), and if they get something unexpected (this film) they judge it on the same criteria as his previous films. Forget about how much you loved ""The Sixth Sense"" or hated ""Lady In The Water"". Watch this one without any M.

1183728,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001DZOC3W,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","The Happening / B001DZOC6Y*Spoilers*The Sixth Sensescared me more than any other movie I've ever seen because it scared me in a very psychological way. No matter how you slice it, that little boy is going to spend the rest of his life viewing gruesome deaths everywhere he goes, with no escape. And he will always be totally alone because, unless he manages to find someone who shares his sixth sense, he will never have anyone to talk to about this, nor will anyone be able to understand him. That's a lot for anyone to handle for their entire life, no matter how much you might initially be resolved to the idea of the talent as a 'gift'.I guess what I'm saying is that I found ""The Sixth Sense"" scary because it scared me on a deeply mental level, and didn't just startle me. And I was deeply intrigued by ""The Happening"" because it seemed like the same type of 'smart horror' that would scare me in a similar manner. Unfortunately, Shyamalan seems to have decided to trade 'scary' for 'startling', because while ""The Happening"" has definite scary potential, it seems regularly eager to trade that in for cheap startles. The blood and gore are, in my mind, excessive and it's hard to escape the feeling that the blood'n'guts were added in a cynical attempt to boost sales with an 'R' rating. Pacing and suspense are almost completely thrown away from the very beginning - within a mere minutes of the movie's opening, the scientists on the telly have already nailed down that the incidents are localized around parks and other flora-heavy areas, that the infection is airborne, that it compels people to suicide, and that it probably isn't terrorist-related. This onslaught of information prevents the viewer from building up any kind of suspense regarding the incidents and all we are left with is the characters to care about.Unfortunately, the characters are where ""The Happening"" is weakest. The acting is just horrible, really every line seems deadpan and every facial expression seems wooden and unnatural. Wahlberg in particular is intensely awful, and what was up with his opening classroom spiel? Even the creationist teachers at my private elementary schools didn't let us scribble ""Gawd did it"" on our homework and call it a day, but Wahlberg seems perfectly at peace with teaching his students that not only will they never understand nature fully, they shouldn't even try. Beyond that, there's the usual horror movie fare of ""rapid escape is essential, so let me just stop to pack some trinkets,"" not to be overshadowed by the ""I know my loved one is dead, but I have to try to find them anyway, leaving my child in the hands of childless strangers who need a new adopted kid to cement their troubled marriage"".A lot about this movie just doesn't feel realistic, and that hurts the 'scary potential' even worse - it's hard to be scared to the point of sleeplessness when it all feels so fake. I don't mean the little stuff like the train stopping because they ""lost contact"" (how?) or the fact that houses and automobiles are generally not air-tight. I mean the big stuff, the stuff that after 9-11 or SARS, movie-makers should really be aware of. Specifically, the ending seems completely unrealistic - for months after 9-11, people in relatively minor cities were still stockpiling water and planning bomb shelters. Faced with something so much bigger, the response would be incredible. Air-tight shelters would be constructed, air masks would be worn, whole forests would be burned down by vigilante militia groups. Which isn't even delving into the fact that the responses of the people DURING the crisis seem pretty unrealistic as well - it's a plague that makes you kill yourself, so people are arming themselves with guns for protection? Gee, that seems kind of like a bad idea.In the end, I was deeply disappointed by ""The Happening"". The movie was definitely startling, but it failed ultimately to be scary.

I know that it has finally exploded my confidence in him as a filmmaker.  As I watched it, the one word that kept coming to mind was ham-handed. The writing, the story, the acting the directing.... heck, even the cinematography... all ham-handed. Nothing seems thought-out in the movie, much less WELL thought-out.To set the record straight, I think that Shyamalan has done some awe-inspiring work even outside of his classic Sixth Sense. Unbreakable and Signs were movies that, even though there were things that I wish had been a little more polished, I thought were extraordinary movies. The Village didn't impress me as much but at least he was still telling a story about characters that I could care about.In The Happening, there is almost no attempt to make the audience care about the characters. And in a suspense movie, guess what? If we don't care about the characters, we don't give a crap about what happens to them.So we get to sit for an hour and a half watching these characters we could care less about try to figure out a mystery that doesn't make any damned sense. When you have to rely on talking heads to make sure that your audience ""gets it"", that is a sure sign that the story has been too weak in itself to make the point you wanted to make and this movie is FULL of ""talking heads"" in television sets.Really, I wanted to like this movie.

Picture is a little grainy, but it is not overwhelming.*Includes some featurettes, deleted scenes, and a gag reel.*The movie itself has a very good filming style.  The cameramanship is splendid.  It is particularly interesting how the camera shows the violence in a way that is not too graphic; I think its better that way.*As I recall hearing, this is the first horror film shot entirely in daylight.*This film does have its scary, freaky moments.  Some parts genuinely thrilled me.  It also had some dry witty moments as well, and some upbeat parts that provides some contrast to an otherwise dreary film.*The premise is interesting (even if it is never fully explained what or why all of this is happening).  The script/story has some interesting concepts, such as the relationship between science, math, nature, and humanity. Possibly some allegories between the characters and modern society.  The story is not bad.*Most people seem to think that the characters/writing/acting is horrid.  I don't really see why; the writing is just as good and interesting as any other movie by M. Night Shyamalan.  The characters are emotional, expressive, and rather touching.  The acting seemed good to me.*The settings are used quite effectively.*Good music.The Bad Things*Not for kids or the extremely squeamish; contains some swearing and violence, including one or two bloody scenes (rated R).*The plot is kind of weird, and ends a little abruptly.*One or two laughable moments (although most people seem to think there are lots of laughable moments).*Slowly paced (although not as bad as some of the other Shyamalan movies, like ""The Village"").The Questionable Things*It is never fully revealed what causes the events or why.  I think it's good that way, because it corresponds to the movie's idea that people can never truly explain natural phenomenon.  But it may also be a dissapointment if you were expecting a straight answer.*Other aspects of the characters and plot are never fully revealed either, and can only be found out by paying close attention or by watching the extras on the disc.Wow, this movie sure has a bad wrap, and I don't know why.  Were you expecting another ""6th Sense"" movie (again)? Then go watch ""The 6th Sense."" ""The Happening"" is another totally different title in Shyamalan's repertoire, and shouldn't really be put in the same league as his first breakthrough film.  This one has no major plot twist.  It has a straightforward story.  It has no oscar-award-winning performances.  It's simply an apocalyptic thriller, on the same level as Spielburg's ""War of the Worlds"" or Frank Darabont's ""The Mist."" To say that this is anything more is obviously a misconception, but I don't think it deserves to be considered something less.  To do so would be to say that Shyamalan is as bad of a director as Uwe Boll, and I don't think he deserves that.I thought that this was just as good of a movie as anything else by Shyamalan (although no better than anything else he made either).  I think it had some interesting elements, ideas, characters, and camerawork.  Some parts of it may even make you think (but it is not wholly obvious in the script; you have to really think about it in order to appreciate it).

The perfect storm of dubious direction, asinine scripting, and poor acting on Mark Wahlberg's part.BUT ask yourself if Wahlberg did not stumble into a moment of accidental genius. This was so unbelievably absurd that if you approach it as being an off-beat comedy it works quite well, and by off-beat I mean so-awful-its-good. I don't know if this was intentional on M.

1183737,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001DZOC3W,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I'm just stumped beyond belief at what happened to M. Night Shyamalan.  He started out with such great promise.  Both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' are masterworks of suspense and intellect; smart reimaginings of commonly treaded genres that often breed inferior replicas of previous works.  I really though back in the early aughts that Shyamalan was going to reinvent the common thriller/horror film and make it something unique and inspired.  I also really thought that he was going to win an Oscar shortly after he lost to Sam Mendez back in 1999.  By now though, his swift embrace by the Academy over the surprise hit that was `The Sixth Sense' seems premature and almost foolish.  He's dropped his ball so far I fear that bending over to pick it up may cause him to hit his head and die.`The Happening' is retarded.The mere premise of this film is actually somewhat inspired.  I mean, the idea that the plants, in an effort to protect themselves from the threat of humanity, have adapted to producing a toxin that causes humans to go temporarily insane and then commit suicide is kind of genius.  From the outset, it would feel like Shyamalan is finding his niche again.  Sadly, the buck stops there and the rest of the `ingredients' are so awfully concocted that the film becomes a massive joke.Completely LOL at Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant.The dialog is ridiculous (hotdogs, really), the acting is horrendous (I love you Zooey, but your comedic approach to this material is distracting) and the plot development is too sporadic for its own good.  Seriously, who is going to believe Wahlberg as a teacher?  I mean, it's honestly distracting.  My dreams of Shyamalan regaining his momentum initially garnered back in 1999 have been abolished over the past few years.  I mean, what is wrong with him?  I will say this; he can direct a chilling sequence (that scene in the creepy house with that nut-job old woman was effectively intense) but he can't write to save his life.  He needs to let someone else write his work from now on.",1,This whispers of a fart in the trees...,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,2051,"[""'m"", 'just', 'stumped', 'belief', 'what', 'happened', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'started', 'out', 'such', 'great', 'promise', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'are', 'masterworks', 'suspense', 'intellect', 'smart', 'reimaginings', 'commonly', 'treaded', 'genres', 'often', 'breed', 'inferior', 'replicas', 'previous', 'works', 'really', 'back', 'early', 'aughts', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'going', 'reinvent', 'common', 'thriller/horror', 'film', 'make', 'something', 'unique', 'inspired', 'also', 'really', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'shortly', 'lost', 'Sam', 'Mendez', 'back', '1999', 'now', 'swift', 'embrace', 'Academy', 'surprise', 'hit', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'premature', 'almost', 'foolish', 'dropped', 'ball', 'so', 'far', 'fear', 'bending', 'pick', 'up', 'may', 'cause', 'hit', 'head', 'die.', 'Happening', 'retarded.The', 'mere', 'premise', 'film', 'actually', 'somewhat', 'inspired', 'mean', 'idea', 'plants', 'effort', 'protect', 'threat', 'humanity', 'have', 'adapted', 'producing', 'toxin', 'humans', 'go', 'temporarily', 'insane', 'then', 'commit', 'suicide', 'kind', 'genius', 'outset', 'would', 'feel', 'Shyamalan', 'finding', 'niche', 'again', 'Sadly', 'buck', 'there', 'rest', 'ingredients', 'are', 'so', 'awfully', 'concocted', 'film', 'massive', 'joke.Completely', 'LOL', 'Wahlberg', 'talking', 'plastic', 'plant.The', 'dialog', 'ridiculous', 'hotdogs', 'really', 'acting', 'horrendous', 'love', 'Zooey', 'comedic', 'approach', 'material', 'distracting', 'plot', 'development', 'too', 'sporadic', 'own', 'good', 'Seriously', 'who', 'going', 'believe', 'Wahlberg', 'teacher', 'mean', 'honestly', 'distracting', 'dreams', 'Shyamalan', 'regaining', 'momentum', 'initially', 'garnered', 'back', '1999', 'have', 'been', 'abolished', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'mean', 'what', 'wrong', 'will', 'say', 'can', 'direct', 'chilling', 'sequence', 'scene', 'creepy', 'house', 'nut-job', 'old', 'woman', 'was', 'effectively', 'intense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'write', 'save', 'life', 'let', 'someone', 'else', 'write', 'work', 'now']",N/A

If you haven't seen the movie and don't want anything ruined, you may not want to read my review. Just a precaution.Technically speaking, I found The Happening an excellent film. The script was good, the acting was excellent and the each character had a very unique personality. Despite the fact that there is little to no lead up to the crisis, Shyamalan skillfully lets us know what has been going on before the opening credits through dialogue.Also, though Shyamalan by no means pushes the max of the R rating, it does allow him to show things that PG-13 wouldn't allow, which, in my opinion, improved the overall quality of the film. At no point during the movie did I feel that Shyamalan was using the blood and violence as an exclusive way to scare the viewer. Instead, it works hand-in-hand with the story and work-up to create a more eery atmosphere. A success in my mind.Yet as I left the theater, I questioned whether I liked the film. Mostly, the enviromentalist plot is always a deterent, as everyone seems to be jumping on the global-warming-crisis-film bandwagon. (The Day AFter Tommorow! AHHHH!)But from where I stand now, I enjoyed the film. Because, as I thought back, the eco-thing was really used as plot device, rather than an agenda. I never felt that the director was pushing a propoganda piece in front of us. It was a film, with a very original villain that drew from an issue of the times.That said, I would reccomend the film. Everyone will make something different of it, as indicated by the wide variety of responses written in reviews. Nevertheless, with a master like M.

It's a good movie, but when I walked out of the theater I wasn't sure what to think. Now thinking back over the film, I realize that the hypothetical ""happening"" makes sense. It all boils down to humanity's affect on mother nature. Why couldn't plants evolve to defend themselves? Plants do communicate, and there were cited examples of that in the film. Evolution is a part of life for all living things, and even though this film is a little far fetched, it's somewhat believeable, and that makes it kind of scary. And now that I think about it, the whole bee thing in the beginning of the movie makes me wonder if that was supposed to be viewed as the catalyst for why ""the happening"" began when it did. It's an interesting idea. I would probably see this movie again.

To me that is a good movie. The idea of this movie is much better that the execution. If you are the type of person that must see everything play out in great detail then you probably won't like this movie. But if an idea can capture you more than the execution than this movies will capture you.As you can probably read, the story concerns a strange neurotoxin that plants begin letting off mysteriously in the northeastern US. At first people don't know what is going on. People first just begin talking funny, then they stop moving, then they kill themselves.  Now sorry people, that is scary. This happens in matter of seconds so after you realize that the person is infected they will likely harm themselves. No one knows what is happening. If it is a terrorist attack or what and it is moving too fast to have time to figure it out. The main character is a teacher who eventually figures out that the neurotoxin is attacking large numbers of people first so they have to get away from people. Scary too is the idea that in most horror flicks people huddle together for safety but in this one, that can be deadly. As nature will do, the neurotoxin starts to adapt and even being alone isn't safe after a while. Nature has decided to take out humans. That right, in this movie your enemy isn't an alien, it is your plants.Was the acting bad? Yes. It is a shame that the acting was so bad.

I guess people didn't like the storyline, which mainly focused on a young couple running away from these poisonous plants that released a chemical making people kill themselves (in graphic ways in a few spots).No, don't worry, it's not what you're probably thinking- you don't actually SEE the plants turn violent with silly special effects and chase after people or anything like that- it's just that, whenever the wind would blow, people had to run for their lives.  Much of the storyline focused on the outside, especially the fields, while people were walking through them and trying to find a place to hide.  The kind of people the young couple met along the way brought a lot of entertainment to the story.And, SURPRISE, I happen to live in one of the areas where the plot was focused on, haha.  I guess I better start being nice to the plants around me then.As I mentioned above, having plants release something that would cause people to kill themselves leaves the door open for a lot of possibilities as far as storyline direction and creativity goes, and the Happening took advantage of this BIG time with lots of incredibly shocking scenes involving suicide and people showing no concern for their own lives because the toxin from the plants was controlling them, and in a way the people on the verge of suicide moved around like zombies.This movie did every single thing right to me- had a LOT of suspense, had a storyline that was easy to follow yet interesting enough to keep you guessing what would happen next, and the main characters were pretty good too (especially the guy).

All of the secondary characters (and I mean all of them) were boring. Instead of trying to follow the film (it wasn't hard, the plot was equally as shallow as the acting) I kept waiting for the death scenes so the secondary people would all get killed off.THE PLOTBasically, plants fight back against humanity because we pollute the environment... yeah. I'm not making this up.If you can handle watching hundreds of different species of plants working together as one to release a single chemical that causes humans to kill themselves (I can't help but laugh at that, even now) then this is the movie for YOU. The funniest part is how the writers tried to keep us viewers in suspense. I had the plot figured out in the first 5 minutes. Not to mention there's nothing even remotely frightening about an oak tree, or a bush, or grass. Oh, the terror!THE DIALOGUEMaybe the dumbest part of the movie. The whole dialogue, along with the horrendous acting, just came across as laughable. I was sitting in the theater with my hand over my mouth so I didn't burst out in a fit of giggles. Wahlberg talked to his wife like he barely knew her.Overall, this movie was just plain bad. The ""scary"" parts weren't scary. The ""feel-good"" parts made me roll my eyes. The ""tragic"" parts weren't tragic. The ""suspenseful"" parts were a joke. The suicides weren't realistic (the best one was a police officer shooting himself in the head with a 9mm. When the body rolls into view we see the wound, and it's this little pin-prick hole in the front of his head dribbling a couple drops of blood), and all the people were stupid. Leguizamo's character just up and leaves his daughter to go look for his wife in New Jersey after pulling some statistics out of his hat (""there's a 62% chance it hasn't been hit yet"").My advice: If you MUST see this movie, rent it.

Night Shyamalan's best film sinceThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series), so I wanted to see for myself.I really liked this movie because it was suspenseful and moved along at a fast clip, but it's definitely not in the same league as The Sixth Sense. That was a gripping movie, filled with eerie, frightening happenings and great acting.The opening scene ofThe Happeningoccurs in Central Park on a bustling, normal day. Two young women are chatting on a bench when suddenly all the others ""freeze in their tracks."" The girls are puzzled, but before her friend can stop her one girl sticks a sharp object in her throat and commits suicide. Thus begins a rash of suicides, construction workers jumping off girders in unison, police officers pulling their own guns and killing themselves... As the media and bureaucratic professionals try to understand and explain what's happening in the mid-Atlantic Coast states, people are fleeing the cities in droves.The movie follows one couple, their friend and his daughter as they join with other survivors along the road west... As they strive to stay alive, their band gets smaller and smaller as people die off all around them, all by suicide. It proves to be ""something in the air"" and as they run for their lives, they learn little by little how to protect themselves. But the neuro-toxins in the wind finally catch up to them and...but this is one of the best scenes and I can't describe it without giving the plot away.Even though this film had little graphics--simply an eerie wind blowing through the foliage--that, the pace and the music made it tense enough for me. And the good actors made it believable; just normal people with a fair share of problems trying to survive a disaster.In my opinion, this is definitely not a horror movie; rather, it's a thought-provoking, creepy film that makes me wonder if something like this could really happen. There is a sweet love story between the married main characters that gives a satisfactory ending to the mid-Atlantic happening. And a frightening twist at the very end that gives the viewer further cause to wonder.Not a masterpiece by any means, but it was very entertaining.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, May 4, 2010Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books",4,Tension in the air...,1272931200,"05 4, 2010",2010,2297,"['heard', 'was', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'best', 'film', 'sinceThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'myself.I', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'suspenseful', 'moved', 'along', 'fast', 'clip', 'definitely', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'gripping', 'movie', 'filled', 'eerie', 'frightening', 'happenings', 'great', 'acting.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'ofThe', 'Happeningoccurs', 'Central', 'Park', 'bustling', 'normal', 'day', 'Two', 'young', 'women', 'are', 'chatting', 'bench', 'when', 'suddenly', 'others', 'freeze', 'tracks', 'girls', 'are', 'puzzled', 'friend', 'can', 'stop', 'one', 'girl', 'sharp', 'object', 'throat', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Thus', 'rash', 'suicides', 'construction', 'workers', 'jumping', 'off', 'girders', 'unison', 'police', 'officers', 'pulling', 'own', 'guns', 'killing', 'media', 'bureaucratic', 'professionals', 'try', 'understand', 'explain', 'what', 'happening', 'mid-Atlantic', 'Coast', 'states', 'people', 'are', 'fleeing', 'cities', 'droves.The', 'movie', 'one', 'couple', 'friend', 'daughter', 'join', 'other', 'survivors', 'road', 'west', 'strive', 'stay', 'alive', 'band', 'smaller', 'smaller', 'people', 'die', 'suicide', 'be', 'something', 'air', 'run', 'lives', 'learn', 'little', 'little', 'how', 'protect', 'neuro-toxins', 'wind', 'finally', 'catch', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'scenes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'describe', 'giving', 'plot', 'away.Even', 'film', 'had', 'little', 'graphics', 'simply', 'eerie', 'wind', 'blowing', 'foliage', 'pace', 'music', 'made', 'tense', 'enough', 'good', 'actors', 'made', 'believable', 'just', 'normal', 'people', 'fair', 'share', 'problems', 'trying', 'survive', 'disaster.In', 'opinion', 'definitely', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'rather', 'thought-provoking', 'creepy', 'film', 'wonder', 'something', 'could', 'really', 'happen', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'married', 'main', 'characters', 'satisfactory', 'ending', 'mid-Atlantic', 'happening', 'frightening', 'twist', 'very', 'end', 'viewer', 'further', 'cause', 'wonder.Not', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'was', 'very', 'entertaining.Reviewed', 'Betty', 'Dravis', 'May', '4', '2010Author', 'Dream', 'Reachers', 'Chase', 'Von', 'other', 'books']",N/A

Yes, evenLady in the Water, which had a heartfelt message at its core and a great actor (Paul Giamatti) leading the way. And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were ""happening.""Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of ""The Unhappening"").Let's see ...where to begin...I guess the story is as bad a place as any...First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit of a caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's ""chasing them.""Second problem...Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (The Departed), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (Ice Age) and Zooey Deschanel (Failure to Launch), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries (""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!"") and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.The final stone...I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M.

From THE SIXTH SENSE to THE VILLAGE, I've enjoyed how his movies involve and wind me up. I was not too kind with my review of LADY IN THE WATER, as I found the movie to be a complete mess only saved from total disaster by its lensing and atmosphere. When I heard he was making another thriller called THE HAPPENING, I was hoping he would redeem himself. While I wasn't totally impressed, I will have to give credit where credit is due and say that THE HAPPENING succeeded on many levels, while coming dangerously close to total disaster.The premise is that something strange in the air is causing humans to lose their ability for self-preservation and find any way possible to kill themselves. The movie presents this unfolding drama quite well, especially the early scene with the construction workers. The movie earned an R rating for many of these scenes but they aren't quite R-Rated as perhaps some of the moments in Fox's FRINGE.The movie moves along quite well, often presenting the paranoia with finesse and always in the ""wind you up"" method that M.Night Shyamalan is famous for. I for one was brought into the situation and found myself even holding my breath a few times when the toxin was near. The discoveries they found and each turn kept me interested. The scene with the kids at the boarded up house was a shocker that broke some taboos in movie making.What brought the movie down a few ratings for me was mainly the Mrs. Jones house scene. Here, the movie went into quirky mode and with some very bad acting, it almost brought the movie down to its knees. The scene where she thought our heroes would kill her in her sleep and Wahlberg's response of ""Noooo...noooo"" was extremely laughable. It almost seemed like a rehearsal scene. Poorly acted. When Mrs. Jones accuses Wahlberg of stealing her doll was another quirky moment. Why Zooey Deschanel is still cast in major roles is a mystery to me. She is not that great of an actress and often a one trick pony. Add to this the ""comic relief"" of showing people in gas masks and huddling in their tubs and the movie was about to be done for me. But the location shots of Mrs. Jones house and the anti-climatic but still pleasant ending saved the movie.I liked THE HAPPENING and I eagerly await Shyamalan next thriller.

As with most Mark Wahlburg movies, it is not his acting that draws this movie down. There are alot of basics that are kind of messed up. It has several disturbing parts, not psychologically scary like in Signs or The Sixth Sense. Just parts that leave you asking ""why"" ?What I do like about The Happening is that it wastes no time to get moving. As I mentioned Wahlburgs performance is good, though there are a few ""over-acted"" parts. Of course everyone gets locked in the house at the end, Shyalaman plays with some old tricks that dont work as well now, and dont get the screams that they have before. I think I wanted the movie to be more fleshed out, more depth. The ending gets close with an emotional moment where Wahlburgs character confronts the ""enemy"" in the wind.

Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that!

Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work.

This way, you definitely know where the blame lies.  In the case of ""The Happening"", we can place the blame squarely with none other than esteemed director M. Night Shyamalan.  It amazes me that this work could come from a guy who directed ""The Sixth Sense"". The only real value in this film is that it is so bad, it is amusing.I gave this movie one star because I did enjoy the opening.  Something strange is happening in Central Park.  People are frozen in their steps.  One young woman stabs herself in the neck with a hairpin.  A few blocks away, a construction worker falls to his death.  This was bad enough, but then the site started raining bodies from the scaffolds.  We learn that this behavior is caused by some sort of neurotoxin in the air.  This neurotoxin shuts off the brain's ability for self-preservation.  Was the neurotoxin released by terrorists?  Is it some sort of government experiment gone bad?  Or is it, perhaps.....the Trees?!The acting was uniformly poor in this film, starting with ""Markie Mark"" Wahlberg in the lead as Elliot.  In this blatant case of miscasting, Wahlberg plays a science teacher.  Not even close.  He got no help from Zooey Deschanel as wife Alma.  Her utility in this film was limited to semi-closeups of her admittedly beautiful blue eyes.  I have never seen an actress less engaged than Deschanel.  While this pandemic was unfolding around her, Ms. Deschanel seemed limited to two or three facial expressions.  Wahlberg and Deschanel had zero chemistry.  John Leguizamo took the role of Julian, the math teacher friend of Elliot.  Luckily for him, he got to commit suicide halfway through. Part of the blame can be assigned to the actors, but the script was so poor that you hate to judge them.One important part of any film or play is pace.  This one moved like a glacier.  You could literally drive a truck through the dialogue cues.  This is director error, plain and simple.There was some nice camera work and special effects.  There is some cool, haunting music.

It's one of those films that is so good you want to check out everything else the director makes.Unfortunately, the rest of Shyamalan's work has well missed the high mark he set with his first major production. Though films like Unbreakable, Signs and The Village had some bright spots, some of his other work has been downright silly and ridiculous...as shockingly evident in ""The Happening.""This is truly filmmaking at its worst, from the goofy politically correct ""green-friendly"" plot (trees and grass ""fighting back"" against civilization and killing people?...Are you serious?) to the total lack of screen chemistry between Wahlberg and Deschanel (not to mention Deschanel's painfully bad acting and Wahlberg's ""stuck in one expression"" close-ups) to the asinine dialogue to the visually lacking camera work.Dialogue, in my opinion, has always been a Shyamalan weakness, as I have yet to find ANYONE in the real world who uses such awkward phrases and over-dramatic statements. In this film, though, he takes this weakness to a whole new level, with absurdly constructed conversations and dramatic delivery that rivals William Shatner on Star Trek (though a cameo by Shatner could have actually HELPED this film!)All in all, this is a true stinker that should be avoided at all costs.

They shiver and shake and spit out a toxin that makes people kill themselves. At one point the star pleads with a plant to not kill him, until he realizes it`s just harmless plastic. Then there's a strange shot of two old ladies knitting while wearing gas masks. (Looks like comedy to me.) But we're also made privy to ghastly and bloodied suicide scenes, such as a man who lays down in front of a moving corn thrasher. I didn`t understand why the driver didn`t kill himself too since he was exposed to the same suicidal toxin.  Bad drama, right?On the run, Walberg and company stumble upon an isolated cabin occupied by a crazy old woman who lives alone and sleeps with a life-sized female doll. (WTH?)

Has a biological weapon been unleashed, or is this some random act of nature? No one is certain, especially not Elliot Moore or the small group of survivors that have chosen to flee the cities, but wherever they go, the deadly contagion seems to follow. It is difficult to decide whether or not THE HAPPENING was actually intended to be a comedy or not, but if it was, M. Night Shyamalan certainly has a morbid sense of humor. One can't help but laugh at the deranged methods of dispatch that Shyamalan has chosen for his victims. He plays an even bigger joke on the audience by trying to pass Mark Wahlberg and John Leguizamo off as science teachers, which is even more unbelievable than his latest twist ending. It is unfair to say that THE HAPPENING is a terrible film when it successfully captivates one's sense of curiosity with the growing mystery and intrigue, but Shyamalan leaves us with no identifiable characters and a threadbare plot.

Night Shyamalan has run out of good or at least original ideas, `The Happening' is the newest nail in his directing coffin.`The Happening' is neither entertaining, interesting, original, or even deserving of an R rating. It is in fact a poor plagiarized version of two Japanese films. `A Wind Named Amnesia' and `Suicide Club.'The plot: A strange breeze strikes NY causing the entire population to spontaneously commit suicide, typically by jumping off a tall building or stabbing themselves in the neck with the nearest sharp object. Since NY has repealed the Second Amendment shootings are rare.The suicidal wind soon spreads to the rest of the North East causing the entire population to evacuate. This is how we're introduced to the cardboard characters of Mark Walberg his even more lifeless wife and their friend John Leguizamo (`House of Buggin') and his token Hispanic daughter.In typical Shyamalan style the story begins in Philadelphia, and expands to the picturesque PA countryside where the characters seek shelter in Toll Brothers' model homes. Did Bob and Bruce Toll pay for the whole damn movie? Shyamalan has really sunk low with this level of product placement.So what happens to the plague we don't care about and the characters we care even less about? Nothing. That's right, nothing. The plaque stops as suddenly and uninterestingly as it starts and the characters live, or rather go on existing as they are not really living.The alleged cause of the deadly wind? Nature is declaring war on mankind. Therefore we must move to another planet and strike back against the earth.The appeal of an R rating is also false. There is more profanity and violence in `The Village' than `The Happening.' Get ready to be disappointed.PS. If you're wondering about the films that Shyamalan blatantly plagiarized, `A Wind Named Amnesia' is a 90 anime drama where aliens cause global amnesia to avoid a nuclear war. There is wide spread death as people cannot even remember how to drive their cars and most starve to death not remembering how to feed themselves. A brave young man and woman still with intelligence begin a cross country USA tour of all the wild sci-fi things taking place. An A drama. Because it's anime it is required to have gratuitous graphic violence, sex, and giant robots.`Suicide Club' is a great letdown of a live action horror film where members of a secret society begin to commit mass suicide.

1183779,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001DZOC3W,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 5]","Uncanny, the way M. Night Shyamalan can ruin an intriguing concept. Like all his other films, ""The Happening"" meanders in far too many directions and ends on a very disappointing note, but not before enticing us with a promising setup. Picture, if you will, a group of people walking in New York's Central Park: they suddenly stop, begin walking backwards, and finally find some way to commit suicide. One young woman impales her neck with her own hair stick, but not before losing her place in the book she was reading. This is quickly followed by a series of construction workers jumping to their deaths; the camera looks up from street level as a number of men step off the scaffolding, coming at us in slow motion. It's a disturbing couple of scenes, but they sure got my attention. I actually wanted to stay with this story, to see where it would go and what would happen and who would be involved.We're then introduced to the main characters, beginning with Elliot Moore (Mark Whalberg), a junior high science teacher from Philadelphia. He challenges his students to theorize why there's been a decline in the world's bee population, why their bodies are nowhere to be found. The only answer he accepts is from a fifteen-year-old boy: they disappeared as the result of a natural phenomenon we will probably never understand. This vague explanation plays as a counterpart to an Einstein quote written on the chalkboard: ""If the bee disappears from the surface of the earth, man would have no more than four years to live."" You would think this scene would be the foundation for the main body of the plot, but no--bees are never again mentioned, and that's a shame because it's a genuine world issue, and real issues are always much scarier than fictional events.Be that as it may, that classroom scene leads to an impromptu faculty meeting, at which point we learn about suspected terrorist activity in New York City. Apparently, some kind of airborne toxin is scrambling everyone's brains, driving them to kill themselves in broad daylight. Soon enough, other Northeastern cities are under attack, and what's worse, it's spreading away from the city parks into less populated country towns. By now, many Philadelphia residents have decided to flee the city via train. Among them are Elliot, his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), his friend, Julian (John Leguizamo), and his young daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). They never reach their destination; the train stops in a middle of nowhere town, and everyone is asked to get off. When Elliot demands an explanation, the conductor says, ""Sir, we've lost contact."" ""With whom?"" Elliot persists. ""Everyone."" Ominous, yes. And it gets worse at a local diner, when the newscaster on TV makes his report: ""The possibility of this event being a terrorist attack is becoming less and less likely.""At this point, the characters rely purely on conjecture, and so do we because absolutely none of it is explained. The mystery, oddly enough, was engaging. It would have been a lot more satisfying, however, had Shyamalan not included a couple of subplots that not only add nothing to the story, but also don't work in and of themselves. One involves Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), an isolated old woman so strange and untrusting that it's a wonder Elliot, Alma, and Jess have dinner at her house. She lets them all stay overnight, yet she's convinced that they're either going to steal from her or murder her while she sleeps. She rudely smacks Jess' hand when she reaches for a cookie sitting on the table; Jess sits still, at which point Mrs. Jones willingly hands her one of the cookies. What any of this has to do with the happening, I have no idea.The other subplot concerns Elliot and Alma, who have apparently been fighting over the most insignificant things. Alma eventually fesses up to a slight indiscretion ... so slight that no committed couple would be so troubled by it. Elliot tries to retaliate by making a very unfunny joke about asking a female pharmacist for cough drops. Either these characters are badly drawn, or Whalberg and Deschanel were horribly miscast. Maybe it's both. It certainly is in Deschanel's case--she gives one of the year's most awkward performances, so awkward that it's unintentionally funny. What does this say about the intentionally funny moments? Not a whole lot, seeing as they were all incredibly inappropriate. Consider this moment with a nursery owner (Frank Collison) when the topic of food comes up: ""Hot dogs get such a bad rap. They have a nice shape. They're protein. You like hot dogs, don't you?"" He then theorizes that the earth's plants are producing the toxin as a means of self-defense, so he makes sure to positively reinforce his garden before leaving.This may sound like a work of genius to you. It sounds more like rambling nonsense to me, and this is all before the ending. While Shyamalan doesn't cheat with a ridiculous plot twist, he does make the fatal mistake of leaving almost everything unresolved. There's a fine line between an air of mystery and an unfinished film, and sadly, it was crossed. Even with an absorbing idea and a few interesting scenes ""The Happening"" is an aimless oddity, a film that isn't the thriller, the love story, or the social commentary it wanted to be. It is, however, blessedly short--a mere ninety-one minutes--which is a welcome relief from the unreasonably tedious lengths of Shyamalan's previous films.

The studio was hyping the ""R"" rating to a degree that rivaled any picture coming out of Lucasfilm.  So what did I feel like we got with this?THE BIGGEST TEASE EVER.  The ""R"" Rating was at a complete minimum of the rating scale, with the exclusion of two fairly cheap looking scenes the film could have easily been another PG-13.  So I felt ripped off about that.  However the biggest issue for me was the fact that the film seemed to build and build and build.  The suspense build was great until the ""MacGuffin"" was exposed, after that the film just seemed to lose it's edge for me.  I sat there waiting for something to happen, waiting for some kind of climactic shock or emotional stir.  However that never came, as much as I like Wahlberg and Deschanel as actors I found myself really not caring at all what happened to them in the end.I found the propaganda in the film to be annoying and weak as well.  I don't want to spoil things as much as some people have but I do wish that some film makers would leave their personal agendas out of films that are simply meant to entertain us.In closing, I was very disappointed by this film.

It begins in Central Park, and then spreads rapidly throughout the East Coast.  Smaller and smaller groups of people are succumbing to this mysterious infliction.  It's only a matter of time before everyone on the East Coast is killed off...""The Happening"" has a wonderful premise.  And, I'll be perfectly honest, it creeped me out.  Show me your vampires, your werewolves, your haunted houses--nothing scares me like seeing ten bodies hanging from the trees over a suburban street.  The fact that, at any moment, our self-preservation drive could be shut down, is a rather terrifying prospect that, at first, Shyamalan delves deeply into.  The first half of the movie is tense and thought-provoking...not to mention flat-out terrifying.But after that...well...it begins to get predictable (even after the director goes out of his way to show us that, yes, he will do whatever he wants).  By the film's end, you're shaking your head, wondering what all the build-up was for.  It's a great start, but a weak ending, and that is what holds the movie back.As for the performances...they take some time to get used to.  It's hard to see Mark Wahlberg as a nice high school professor; at first, it seems like he's doing a horrible Ryan Reynolds impersonation.  By the films end, however, you respect Wahlberg for restricting himself; I'm pretty sure he doesn't drop the f-bomb once, and that's pretty good for him.  Zooey Deschanel, likewise, seems restrained; it isn't until halfway through the picture that you come to understand why.  John Leguizamo, in his too-small role, is a wonder; the man is a chameleon.Overall, ""The Happening"" is a stronger film than Shyamalan's last effort, ""Lady in the Water"" (which was almost unbearable at points, despite solid acting from lead Paul Giamatti).  The R-rating is a pleasant surprise; Shyamalan lets you know, within the first five minutes, that he plans on taking full-advantage of the looser restrictions.  It's interesting, actually--yes, there's more gore, but it's still restrained; there's still the trademark Shyamalan minimalism.  However, there isn't that big ""oh my God REALLY?"" moment (which, lets face it, we're expecting); this, in part, leads to the film's lack-luster ending.  It's hard to tell if the pro's outweigh the con's here...I reccommend seeing the film for yourself, before you judge.

1183792,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B001DZOC3W,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","Can we please stop talking about M. Night Shyamalan as a ""master"" or ""genius"" already?  The man hasn't made a good movie sinceThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series).  Most one-hit wonders just disappear, but Shyamalan just keeps coming back.  Fortunately, The Happening isn't as bad as, say,Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition), and Shyamalan doesn't cast himself as the enlightened genius who will save the day as he did in that perniciously bad film.  Still, if you screened this film to an audience without telling them it's a Shyamalan film, there's a 62% chance every one of them would hate it (hey, if a character in the movie can give something a 62% probability of happening or not happening without any evidence whatsoever at his disposal, I can do the same thing - in fact, I am going to start using the word Shyamalan as a verb meaning to fudge numbers in a vain attempt to make yourself look smart).So what happens in The Happening?  Not a whole heck of a lot.  New York City finds itself the epicenter of a terrifying and mysterious attack by a biological or chemical agent that makes everyone it comes in contact with kill himself or herself.  The squeamish should not be concerned in the slightest, as people somehow manage to cut their own jugular veins, jump off of tall buildings, and even shoot themselves in the head without actually bleeding.  You would think mass suicide on such an unprecedented scale would leave the big cities swimming in blood and gore, but no - all Shyamalan gives us is a bunch of dummies strewn about the landscape.  When others talk about how frightening some of the scenes are, I have to wonder if we actually watched the same movie.  I guess a couple of scenes might prove disturbing to young children, but I see no reason for this film receiving an R rather than a PG-13 rating.Mark Wahlberg plays a New York City biology teacher who joins the masses of people calmly evacuating the city (yep, millions of New Yorkers flee town without even a single incidence of pushing and shoving) with his wife, a buddy, and that buddy's little girl.  Elliott (Wahlberg) and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) make for an odd couple.  I don't know what was up with Alma, but half the time it seemed like she and Elliott had just met.  John Leguizamo plays Elliott's buddy, but Leguizamo is totally wasted on the part.  Anyway, Elliott and his crew end up on the run, trying to find the most isolated of areas to hide out in (by this point, Elliott has a hunch or two as to what is actually going on).I guess the ""big twist"" this time around is the lack of a big twist.  Shyamalan should really consider hiring someone to write his endings for him, as the ending of The Happening just sort of lays there like a dead fish - a smelly dead fish.  The end result is a movie that only Al Gore could love (for reasons that will become clear if you see the film) - even though I half suspect that even he would find it boring in places.  The best thing I can say about The Happening is that it's not quite as bad asLady in the Water (Widescreen Edition).",2,Yet another patented Shyamalan snoozefest,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,3088,"['Can', 'please', 'stop', 'talking', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'master', 'genius', 'already', 'man', ""n't"", 'made', 'good', 'movie', 'sinceThe', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'Series', 'Most', 'one-hit', 'wonders', 'just', 'disappear', 'Shyamalan', 'just', 'coming', 'back', 'Fortunately', 'Happening', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Shyamalan', ""n't"", 'cast', 'enlightened', 'genius', 'who', 'will', 'save', 'day', 'did', 'perniciously', 'bad', 'film', 'Still', 'screened', 'film', 'audience', 'telling', 'Shyamalan', 'film', '62', '%', 'chance', 'one', 'would', 'hate', 'hey', 'character', 'movie', 'can', 'give', 'something', '62', '%', 'probability', 'happening', 'not', 'happening', 'evidence', 'whatsoever', 'disposal', 'can', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'fact', 'am', 'going', 'start', 'using', 'word', 'Shyamalan', 'verb', 'meaning', 'fudge', 'numbers', 'vain', 'attempt', 'make', 'look', 'smart', '.So', 'what', 'Happening', 'Not', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'epicenter', 'terrifying', 'mysterious', 'attack', 'biological', 'chemical', 'agent', 'everyone', 'contact', 'kill', 'squeamish', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'concerned', 'slightest', 'people', 'somehow', 'manage', 'cut', 'own', 'jugular', 'veins', 'jump', 'tall', 'buildings', 'even', 'shoot', 'head', 'actually', 'bleeding', 'would', 'think', 'mass', 'suicide', 'unprecedented', 'scale', 'would', 'leave', 'big', 'cities', 'swimming', 'blood', 'gore', 'Shyamalan', 'bunch', 'dummies', 'strewn', 'landscape', 'When', 'others', 'talk', 'how', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'are', 'have', 'wonder', 'actually', 'watched', 'same', 'movie', 'guess', 'couple', 'scenes', 'might', 'prove', 'disturbing', 'young', 'children', 'see', 'reason', 'film', 'receiving', 'R', 'rather', 'PG-13', 'rating.Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'biology', 'teacher', 'who', 'masses', 'people', 'calmly', 'evacuating', 'city', 'yep', 'millions', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'flee', 'town', 'even', 'single', 'incidence', 'pushing', 'shoving', 'wife', 'buddy', 'buddy', 'little', 'girl', 'Elliott', 'Wahlberg', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'make', 'odd', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'up', 'Alma', 'time', 'seemed', 'Elliott', 'had', 'just', 'met', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Elliott', 'buddy', 'Leguizamo', 'totally', 'wasted', 'part', 'Anyway', 'Elliott', 'crew', 'end', 'up', 'run', 'trying', 'find', 'most', 'isolated', 'areas', 'hide', 'out', 'point', 'Elliott', 'hunch', 'two', 'what', 'actually', 'going', '.I', 'guess', 'big', 'twist', 'time', 'around', 'lack', 'big', 'twist', 'Shyamalan', 'should', 'really', 'consider', 'hiring', 'someone', 'write', 'endings', 'ending', 'Happening', 'just', 'sort', 'lays', 'dead', 'fish', 'smelly', 'dead', 'fish', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'only', 'Al', 'Gore', 'could', 'love', 'reasons', 'will', 'become', 'clear', 'see', 'film', 'even', 'half', 'suspect', 'even', 'would', 'find', 'boring', 'places', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Happening', 'not', 'quite', 'bad', 'asLady', 'Water', 'Widescreen', 'Edition']",N/A

But before I go any further, I want to strongly advise people who are severely depressed, or currently have issues with suicidal ideation (thinking/fantasies ) NOT to see this movie. The violence portrayed can be summed up in one word - harsh! The Happening is also wildly inappropriate for children and young teens! Consider this warning a Public Service announcement by someone who used to work with people in crisis!Personally, it's sad to see Director Shyamalan stoop so low. His masterpiece, ""The Sixth Sense,"" is one of the greatest supernatural fantasy films of all time! He obviously likes to work in this genre, and there are plenty of stories written along these lines over the past hundred years to tap into for ideas! But no, he most follow the majority of Hollywood and dumb down his films, too! The Happening will certainly make Director Shyamalan a quick buck, but it will also damage his brand. He's slowing and steadily becoming the ""Roger Coreman"" of schlock film making. I, for one, will certainly think twice before paying my hard earned money to see another one of his films in the future!The story  is also so preposterous it comes across ultimately as campy. Intelligent plants are so smart they only wipe out people from Maryland to Massachusetts, as a ""warning"" against Mankind's abuse of the environment! The plant kingdom is only defending it's self from our wanton destruction of the environment. But they can't be all that smart if they attack one of our nation's most environmentally friendly regions in the United States! For example, the LARGEST park in the entire United States, outside of Alaska, is in New York State and it's a STATE park, called the Adirondacks. It's even in the State Constitution to remain forever wild! New York City and the surrounding environs,  has some of the cleanest drinking water in the United States. One of the greatest zoos in the entire world, which works tirelessly to save endangered species, and to educate the rest of us is the BRONX Zoo! New York State dismantled its last built  Nuclear Power plant before it was even turned on! So my dear,  Shyamalan, The Schlockmeister, you had your pathetic plant kingdom army attack the wrong part of the country! Duh!No one is denying that there's an audience for this kind of intense violence and stupidity, but there's a much larger audience for intelligent story making. Hopefully, The Happening will take a drubbing at the box office and teach this formerly bright filmmaker a valuable lesson!The Adirondack Atlas: A Geographic Portrait of the Adirondack Park, andWild Lives: A History of People & Animals of the Bronx Zoo, andThe Politics of Nuclear Power: A History of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant (Risk, Governance and Society), andWater-Works: The Architecture and Engineering of the New York City Water Supplyand last, but not least -Your Movie Sucks",1,Shyamalan The Schlockmeister Strikes Again!,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,3030,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'seeing', 'dozens', 'people', 'Big', 'Screen', 'graphically', 'creatively', 'committing', 'suicide', 'not', 'idea', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'go', 'further', 'want', 'strongly', 'advise', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'severely', 'depressed', 'currently', 'have', 'issues', 'suicidal', 'ideation', 'thinking/fantasies', 'NOT', 'see', 'movie', 'violence', 'portrayed', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'word', 'harsh', 'Happening', 'also', 'wildly', 'inappropriate', 'children', 'young', 'teens', 'Consider', 'warning', 'Public', 'Service', 'announcement', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'work', 'people', 'crisis', 'Personally', 'sad', 'see', 'Director', 'Shyamalan', 'so', 'low', 'masterpiece', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'one', 'greatest', 'supernatural', 'fantasy', 'films', 'time', 'obviously', 'work', 'genre', 'are', 'plenty', 'stories', 'written', 'lines', 'past', 'hundred', 'years', 'tap', 'ideas', 'most', 'follow', 'majority', 'Hollywood', 'dumb', 'down', 'films', 'too', 'Happening', 'will', 'certainly', 'make', 'Director', 'Shyamalan', 'quick', 'buck', 'will', 'also', 'damage', 'brand', 'slowing', 'steadily', 'becoming', 'Roger', 'Coreman', 'schlock', 'film', 'making', 'one', 'will', 'certainly', 'think', 'twice', 'before', 'paying', 'hard', 'earned', 'money', 'see', 'one', 'films', 'future', 'story', 'also', 'so', 'preposterous', 'across', 'ultimately', 'campy', 'Intelligent', 'plants', 'are', 'so', 'smart', 'only', 'wipe', 'out', 'people', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'warning', 'Mankind', 'abuse', 'environment', 'plant', 'kingdom', 'only', 'defending', 'wanton', 'destruction', 'environment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'smart', 'attack', 'one', 'nation', 'most', 'environmentally', 'friendly', 'regions', 'United', 'States', 'example', 'LARGEST', 'park', 'entire', 'United', 'States', 'Alaska', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'STATE', 'park', 'called', 'Adirondacks', 'even', 'State', 'Constitution', 'remain', 'forever', 'wild', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'surrounding', 'environs', 'cleanest', 'drinking', 'water', 'United', 'States', 'One', 'greatest', 'zoos', 'entire', 'world', 'tirelessly', 'save', 'endangered', 'species', 'educate', 'rest', 'BRONX', 'Zoo', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'dismantled', 'last', 'built', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'plant', 'was', 'even', 'turned', 'dear', 'Shyamalan', 'Schlockmeister', 'had', 'pathetic', 'plant', 'kingdom', 'attack', 'wrong', 'part', 'country', 'Duh', 'one', 'denying', 'audience', 'kind', 'intense', 'violence', 'stupidity', 'much', 'larger', 'audience', 'intelligent', 'story', 'making', 'Hopefully', 'Happening', 'will', 'take', 'drubbing', 'box', 'office', 'teach', 'formerly', 'bright', 'filmmaker', 'valuable', 'lesson', 'Adirondack', 'Atlas', 'Geographic', 'Portrait', 'Adirondack', 'Park', 'andWild', 'Lives', 'History', 'People', 'Animals', 'Bronx', 'Zoo', 'andThe', 'Politics', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'History', 'Shoreham', 'Nuclear', 'Power', 'Plant', 'Risk', 'Governance', 'Society', 'andWater-Works', 'Architecture', 'Engineering', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Water', 'Supplyand', 'last', 'not', 'least', '-Your', 'Movie', 'Sucks']",N/A

1183796,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B001DZOC3W,Daryl B,"[2, 5]","M. Night Shyamalan broke out of the gate several years ago with a great suspense film and blockbuster hit, ""The Sixth Sense"".  Now returning, after a string of movies with lukewarm reviews from both fans and critics, the director offers us a film with a thought provoking and interesting concept though not, perhaps, very original....the idea of nature striking back at a consistently irreverant mankind.  The problem is that this movie, unfortunately, doesn't deliver on the potential of a really good idea.The story revolves around Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) a high school teacher and his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), who along with others on the northeastern seaboard of the U. S. become trapped in a horrifying biological event.  Starting in New York City's crowded Central Park, people suddenly fall prey to an ""illness"" that, after disorientation leads to the victims fatally wounding themselves.  With their friend, Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter, Jess, the four board a train to leave the area only to find themselves stranded in the danger zone.  What follows is the group (and others) trying to find a way to survive until they can reach the border of the event-free area.Shyamalan does deliver some chilling moments in this film.  The death scenes are particularly eerie---the suicide jumpers falling off the buildings in New York and the man at the zoo in the cage with the lions, for example. Betty Buckley also offers a thoroughly creepy character with some spooky scenes late in the film. The director doesn't have to be overly gory to make the hair stand up on the back of our necks but the film does need a consistent flow to the building suspense that he supplies with vigor during the first half of the movie.It is the acting and the execution of the concept that offer the biggest problems.  I'm not very familiar with Zooey Deschanel but I found her performance competely lacking and her character, annoying and unlikable.  Wahlberg did a fair job with his character, although I think he can be more charasmatic and entertaining than his portayal in this movie. I think the whole subplot of the young couple's minor marital problems was completely unnecessary and Shyamalan could have worked harder on better dialogue.  The biggest problem, however, is the follow through.  ""The Happening"" has a great first half...the building horror and dread of the unknown is a powerful trigger for the viewers.  But the final half of the film doesn't render a satisfying climax to appease the fans and leave us spellbound and shaken.  I think its unfair for fans and critics alike to expect Shyamalan to toss a mind-bending twist at the end of each film.  I do expect, though, for this director (in whom I still have faith) to reward his dedicated fans with a story (and actors) that are worthy of such a terrifying biological phenomenon.

What keeps it wiggling and what binds it together?""The Happening,"" which is his latest creepy film, is a modern cautionary tale ripped from the collective sensibilities of life after Sept. 11, 2001 and the status of human beings in their interaction with today's environment.Episodes of strange, chilling deaths that defy reason and boggle the mind in their shocking destructiveness erupt in major American cities in ""The Happening"".Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore: a sensitive high school science teacher in Philadelphia. When an incident occurs in New York City, the whole northeastern part of the United States is put on alert.Another teacher, Julian (John Leguizamo), manages to get train tickets for himself and his daughter to a more rural area. He invites Elliot and his emotionally distant wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), to travel with them in hopes of staying clear of the impending trouble.The train is forced to stop because of communication problems and a paranoia of ""every man for himself"" creeps into the evacuees. Groups split up and start off by car - and then by foot - hoping to hide deeply into rural Pennsylvania.Elliot and Alma come upon a remote farmhouse of an old woman - played by Betty Buckley - who's cut off from the world but might be able to help.Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) take a closer look at an encroaching and powerful threat in ""The Happening"".Photo credit: Zade Rosenthal, 20th Century FoxAfter an early winning streak of films (including ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable""), Shyamalan's output since has been mostly perplexing to audiences and critics. He's a genre unto himself with story characteristics that are manufactured uniquely through deliberate perspective.This has resulted in hit-or-miss propositions. He continues that distinct stamp in ""The Happening"" by creating a situation of paranoia that's very familiar in these times.The detail of human beings finding it necessary to try and formulate answers from mysterious circumstances is well represented especially through Wahlberg's ""by the book"" science teacher.The ""event"" also has to do with the environment around us. The question asked in the film is as follows: As humans are the most influential species on the planet, how will this dominance affect the finite resources of the planet? What force of nature will rise up against this dominance?This particular circumstance also had an Alfred Hitchcock vibe. It used the unseen force as a pursuer much like his film ""The Birds"". The master of suspense is even represented in the soundtrack, which would be at home in any of his films.Suspending disbelief is important in the experience of ""The Happening"". There are many unanswered improbabilities in the plot and some misconstrued elements that produced unintentional laughs. It's best to go with the flow and realize that - in M.

I wasn't excited by it, thrilled by it, terrified by it, happy or sad, about it; no, I just found it a quiet, interesting, journey through city and countryside in which, subtly, without visible cause, people began to kill themselves, to lose control, and no one could fathom why or protect themselves from having the same thing happen to them.

This 2008 movie is a thought-provoking thriller that provides hints, but no real answers to the apocalyptic crisis. The audience is left to sort through the possible causes of the cataclysmic Happening, as well as to decide what it was that ended the crisis as quickly as it began.Was there an environmental catastrophe? Was there some earthly ecological consciousness that arose to fight off the harmful human presence that is destroying the planet? Was it a malevolent supernatural force that moved in the air, possessing and killing victims in its wake?What stopped or slowed the phenomenon? Did it peter out as a storm dissipates? If it was some satanic force, did it just move on to another place (Paris) to possess its next victims? If the catastrophe was caused by an intelligence, ecological or supernatural, did it recognize the power of love, which halted it in its tracks?The story focuses on the troubled relationship of a couple (Wahlberg, Deschanel) fleeing their urban life in search of anywhere safer. Both characters were played simply, pared down, but endearing and demonstrating a vulnerability and truthfulness.I was reminded of the Biblical story of Lot and his wife, and their flight from the doomed twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Despite the couples' efforts in both stories, they failed to save the population (or fellow refugees) after repeated attempts.I didn't find clear answers in the film, but enjoyed debating the issues afterwards. I enjoy films like this that offer more than just entertainment for a couple of hours. Shyamalan takes his place with Rod Serling (and perhaps even Carl Sagan) as a modern speculative storyteller who seeks to understand humanity and our relationship not only to each other but to the cosmos.I enjoyed The Happening enough to purchase the BD copy. I have seen both the DVD and Blu-ray versions. The Blu-ray offers a few bonus featurettes not included on the DVD edition, as well as improved picture and nice audio quality, and a textual commentary track with occasional PiP interview material. It is regrettable that there is no commentary track from the principals or writer-director Shyamalan on either version.

Thinking about it, that's probably not a good sign, but anyway.This film is a very strange mix of straight horror, creepy atmosphere, and what must be tongue in cheek scripting. As another reviewer has noted, there is no way anyone would seriously pass a script about, basically, the apocalypse where people take it upon themselves to extol the virtues of hot dogs, or say ""Elliot's very resilient isn't he"".The acting makes Jersey Shore look like the Royal Shakespeare Company, which again, must be partly intentional, surely. Wahlberg et al cruise through the end of the world looking like they just stepped out of a high street fashion shop window, and are more wooden than the mannequins. The 'conversation through a pipe' sequence near the end is simply preposterous, but the fact that the little girl is playing with a frog in a stone trough in a shed does at least add to the sense of the uncanny.

1183809,AAU7CAQIN5BAE,B001DZOC3W,"EliteLamo ""too weird to live, too rare to die""","[4, 7]","Review: 'The Happening'Roving Info: Director: M. Night ShyamalanThe Buzz: James Newton Howard, (in which the score is often errie and filled with actual purpose, fitting the breathtaking cinematography)A. Let me start by providing you with actual post on Various sites about M. Night's work and The Happening, food for thought to start the review:---He should make a movie in which he dies, NOW THAT WOULD BE awsome, (sic) I would see it just not to feel bad about throwing my money away with The lady in the water and The happening. What do you think. ------Hi Arjun from India here and this guy is just embarrassing to all Indians. He should stop making movies. ------He seriously needs to do Bollywood. He can use his ""originality"" there - maybe have the actors dance around in dinosaur suits or something.  --- (or something, riveting!)---His last 3 movies have been terribble. His storylines are always full of holes and pretty pointless. He should give everyone that went to go see ""The Happening"" the price of there ticket back out of his own pocket. Hopefully the next time he's in a bid to do another movie, some one else is smart enough to remeber(sic) the absolute bombs hes been making, and politely show him to the door------I wouldn't rent a Shyamalan DVD even if it came with a free prostitute!------Seriously, this guy's career should have been over the day after Unbreakable came out. Not one movie of his since the Sixth Sense has been of any decent quality...NOT ONE! Do us all a favor, Night...blacklist yourself! Told!---(huh?)---I don't hate the guy personally, but when he showed up with ""The Sixth Sense"" and then ""Unbreakable"" i think i and a lot of others, thought he was a guy who could provide moviegoers with years of great movies.His output has been close to awful, and declining steadily ever since.So i don't hate him. I'm just really disappointed---One can no clearly see the kind of blatant and common ignorance and stupidity amongst the masses, the claim they hate someone because of a certain type of film genre that person doesn't agree with. Morever, the most common element in most M. Night haters, is they dont just hate one of his films, they despise ALL OF THEM, and then throw in their nuances here and there as to why it was 'ok most of the time, but the rest I just didn't get.' Get a wetnap.Our last friend said he was really disappoinmted, disappointed in what??????????? originality? nonlinear? err, different? Off the beaten path of movie fans who adore live-action, comicbook saturation, and the same people that make Bev Hills Chihuahua the number one grossing movie in the box office of late, and that, that my friends, is the very coinage of our times. What a sad lot.1. I truly believe that most of the people that despise M. Night, and I am indeed generalizing, couldn't grasp the conceptual understanding that his movies ARE supposed to be that way. The movies are supposed to actually dare you to be different and even on the mass ignorance that abounds on message boards like 'IMDB' and 'Fandango', make you try to think out of the box. His films, especially 'Sixth Sense' and unequivocally 'The Village', take the film goer out of the realm of being and even for two hours, transport you to M's world. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being different AND brillaint? You go make a film and see how ORIGINAL it is. I firmly believe that the lovers of M's movies, are a rare breed, a special kind of movie lover. They attain 'Ken' status of the kind of people I want to surround myself with. Not Ironman fanatics. The folks who I have met who are passionate about movies, think that 'The Village' is one of the greatest films of the last ten years, and I have to agree.It's hard for people to accept different I suppose. These same Night haters, are going to bash him, prod him and hate his movies, long before they are released, all because they are not part of that circle, they have very limited attention spans, and couldn't for the life of them try to conceptually follow a film like the 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Village'. I would suppose it could be the equivalent of taking someone from a rolling-open admissions community college and dropping them in a full semesters load at Yale.2. This unbridled ignorance is truly astounding. Like the samples of post on IMDB and the like, the totality of claims of why the haters, completely loath his films and career is clearly evident. ""His movies suck, he sucks, they are boring and pointless and they dont make sense"" Hmm, nice argument. In my time off of recent, I have sifted through 100's of post, and for the most part, the reasoning or lack there of, is purely the same. Personally, I am not a fan of sketch comedy type films, anything with Will Ferell or the like, and not a Cohen Brothers fan, I don't enjoy chick flicks, or anything with Martin Lawrence. I believe Lucas should have left the Star Wars Series where it was at in the seventies and eighties and not made the abomination of the later three we were mauled into watching. I think Taratino is as untalented of a director as The Rock is to his acting ability, however, and I mention all these personal opinions, to say I would take an M. Night film, albeit even bad, any day of the week, month or year, over what is in the box office today.The Film:::::::While I do agree with most folks assessment on the nature of The Happening being feverishly boring to the point of yawning many times, and lacking appropriate suspense, I found it rather intriguing. My major problem with the film was the wooden characters, and that would reflect poor writing and directing, however, that doesn't mean the person is bad at his profession period. It is strange to me the often non tangible characters in the film, especially Walhberg's role, considering M. Night's expertise at amazing dialouge and interactions. I didn't often heavily care whether they escaped the toxin, could care less about his wife, and don't really care about anyone else they picked up along the way. However, the plot is in an element all its own, and if you havent seen it, ignore these haters and naysayers and see for yourself, with an open and shrewd eye to something different. The film has M. Night's signature on it, as if I were screening it without any credits not knowing who's it was, I would without question, say Night did this film. Original, thought provoking and mildly entertaining. People here can dissect each element of the film, and dog it, bring it down in ratings, and use their splendid fingers to tell us just why it was so bad. The same way those, perhaps same people, use unwarranted claims as to why films like Death Proof are revolutionary.There are very few movies that I actually go to see in the physical theatres. Anytime an epic comes out like 'Troy', '300' or stuff like 'Dances With Wolves', because of the totality and grand majesty of such a film that only can be appreciated on the big screen. That said, the one director, save Speilberg for the most part, that I always will go see is M. Night, hate him or love him, he certainly causes an uproar in the online movie loving community. Why? Because he is different, and makes us think, and brings us films that few, IF ANY, director can in todays saturated market of blockbusters and cookie-cutter talent.In conclusion: While the film may not be for the everyday movie goer, it certainly has its market. No it wasn't the best film, in fact it wasn't the best Night film by a long shot, but it was still unique, interesting and different, and for that alone, I enjoyed it intensely. The haters can't like it, they aren't capable of liking it, they will never like ANYTHING he does, and they are increasingly annoying. If you don't like his movies, then DONT GO SEE THEM, if you think they are going to be awful, then don't waste your money, if you cant stand him being different and cutting edge with ideas that make our minds wonder and yearn for more, then don't SEE HIS MOVIES. There are a lot of us that do like M. Night, and nothing you can say will ever change that fact.",3,"""The Unbridled Ignorance of M.Night haters""",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",2008,8107,"['Review', ""'The"", ""Happening'Roving"", 'Info',

He still seems capable of coming up with original and interesting ideas for a story (at least for the first 15 to 30 minutes of the film), but as they develop Mr. Shymalan now seems incapable of bringing them to the one-of-a-kind clever ending, as he did in The Sixth Sense, instead, he is getting worst: Mother Nature taking revenge against human kind for its evils against her?. Come on, this is not only a bad ending but also a cheap environmental message. The public does not deserve to endure until the end for such ridiculous explanation.There are at least two literary pieces from the Nobel-laureate Portuguese novelist Jos&eacute; Saramago that follow a similar storyline, ""As Intermitncias da Morte"" (English:Death with Interruptions) and ""Ensaio sobre a cegueira"" (English:Blindness (Movie Tie-In)) and yes this is the one that gave inspiration for the script of the movieBlindness. In the former, suddenly nobody dies within the borders of a country, and in the latter, everybody begins to get blind without a logical explanation. Regardless of the Saramago's fantastic or supernatural explanation for such weird events, the real value of both stories resides in how the writer shows you the real nature of human beings, naked with all of our defects, fears and weaknesses. Just for that, both books are worth the reading. But in The Happening no such a message is present, so you endure for 90 minutes waiting for a clever explanation in vain. Add weak performances and excessively gross and shocking scenes, there nothing left.It seems Mr. Shymalan is after all just one of those artists with only one extraordinary piece of work, and the more he keeps trying, the worst he performs.

Night Shyamalan basically has created movies that slowly go less and less into his first works The Sixth Sense in overall quality. But when it was announced that Fox wanted him to make his first ever ""R"" rated picture, would that be enough to break him out of his never-ending slump?Nope.The Happening stars Mark Walberg as a high school science teacher who among everyone else in his Pennsylvania suburb hears that an airborne biological terrorist attack has landed in New York causing it's victims to lose control and find a way to commit suicide. As residents flee towards help, soon they realize that this attack has spread over the Northeastern portion of the United States and that they're right in the middle of it. But is this plague manmade or of a more natural kind? Could it be caused by nature itself? Will anybody know or care after watching this dreck?!!?I doubt it. While ""M"" and this film try to be all scientific-like interesting, it truly falls amazingly flat. To be honest, this is M. Night's absolute worse film. First, the infected all basically do the same thing which is babble for a second, walk backwards, and find some way to kill themselves, all the while looking like they are still in complete control. Another is the dialouge. While the acting isn't all that great to begin with, I personally haven't heard words written this bad since some kid named Anakin was breaking some pregnant chick's heart. At times I truly felt more for myself watching this than for the victims screaming at the sight of seeing a brisk breeze of air flowing ever so calmly in front of them. Oh my God, WIND!!!!!However, an ""R"" rating does mean something had to earn it and in a small way it has. Some of the suicides are a bit clever, and yes, even reach R graphicness, but there's just not enough of them to save this movie. In fact, M. Knight himself (through interviews and deleted scenes) cut a few himself, not in fear of the MPAA, but out of thinking less is more. But trust me, the more the merrier really could have helped this fart of a flix. The disc itself does have alot of special features including deleted scenes (that are terrible), documentaries, and also a gag reel (that doesn't have one single blooper....where's the gag?).

1183813,A28SBPF6KFZ7VL,B001DZOC3W,Eric K.,"[2, 5]","It's true.  M. Night Shyamalan pulled off another movie with a silly storyline.  The movie started with a dark, ominous tone with a lot of potential to be a great thriller, but then quickly took a nosedive, much like (spoiler!) the men in the movie jumping off the construction site building.  It soon became a snuff film as it tried to compete with the likes ofHostelorFinal Destination.  People started killing themselves in unique and varied forms for no apparent reason.  One guy even fed his body to lions at the zoo.  Another layed down on the ground so he would get run over by a lawnmower.  EEEWW.  And the mystery of what actually was ""happening"" was never fully resolved.  It doesn't have to be to make a good movie, but for this one (since it was kind of silly), it would have been nice to have that closure.  We don't want ""The Happening 2""...happening.As for the acting, what was up with Marky Mark?  Er...serious actor Mark Wahlberg?  His acting in ""The Happening"" could compete with Cary Elwes'Sawperformance.  And what about John Leguizamo doing an impression of Steve (Miranda's husband) fromSex and the City?  Plus, he got third billing in the movie and was in there for -- what? -- 10 minutes?""The Happening"" wasn't totally unwatchable.  And I thought it was better than Shyamalan's previous duds,Lady in the Water,The Village, and (for me) evenSigns (Vista Series).

While the ""threat"" or ""main issue"" of the movie is often dramatic and horrifying, the dialogue and relationships of the characters are usually delicate and graceful.  There's a beautiful subtly to his movies that tug at your heart ever so gently.  All of his main characters have wounded souls that, somehow through the difficulty they confront in the course of the story, figure out their greatest strengths.  Not every ending is a perfect one and not every loose end is neatly tied and I wonder if that's why so many are walking away from his movies disappointed.  There's no bang-bang shoot em' up or excessive gratuitous sex in every scene.  I really walk away feeling connected to the people in his films.  They seem like everyday people (with the exception of a few supernatural powers in some of his films - lol) with everyday internal struggles and I like that.The Happening's characters are really no different than any of Mr. Shyamalan's other films, but the story is definitely different.  No one ever fully answers the question of what is happening, yet there is a perfectly scientific plausibility to the event.  I felt a myriad of emotions from fear and panic to being intrigued with how the story unfolded and ultimately how it ended.This was a good movie.  I think what so many viewers are dissatisfied with is M. Night Shyamalan's style.  He's a unique director and producer just like Quentin Terantino is... you either like his style or you don't.

Night takes a rather artful approach to filing somebody dieing. Of course, that rather artful scene could be the only one of the movie, as it's a stark contrast to a later scene where a man purposely feeds his arms to a group of lions. It's not bad in of itself, it just comes out like a Monty Python sketch. And this would be the story of the movie. At times it's well-done, and at times it's laughable.Example, the marriage troubles that's the unfortunate subplot of the movie involves the wife feeling guilty, acting like she's cheated on her husband, come to find out she only had cheesecake with him. It's at this fact, that the husband feels lied to and betrayed about. To this, he responds by conjuring a story saying he was so attracted to a pharmacist, he bought cough medicine, even though he didn't have a cough. The wife is horrified at this fact, until the husband reveals he was kidding. Yes, this subplot is pretty bad, but also delightfully cheesy.The Happening happens to be an attack of plants on humans by releasing a toxin that makes anybody affected to kill themselves via any means. Why are the plants doing this? Because we're poisoning our environment, which is the real horror in this movie. It's incredibly cheesy, and entertaining, even though it could have been carried out better in terms of plot/action. I mean, if NYC is killed by plant toxins, that's going to set the nation back quite a bit, not to mention the massive loss of life. Also, don't try to figure out the logistics of the toxin, or how it works, because you will be confused. It kills people in large groups, then kills a singular people without explanation.Mark Wahlberg has seen better roles, however he carries possibly the film's funniest/cheesiest moment when he finds himself talking to a plant, trying to convince it that he means them no harm, and he only wishes to go to the restroom, come to find out the plant is plastic. With scenes like this, I'm even surprised he took the role. Zooey plays the wife who likes to keep her feelings inside, even though Zooey is known for being that energetic indie girl. Besides the fact that plants are makes people kill themselves, Zooey is still the highlight of the movie.Seen as the cheesy film it is, M.

1183822,A73DFWJE0CGY6,B001DZOC3W,"Flight Risk (The Gypsy Moth) ""Exiled Yankee""","[1, 2]","Yet another M. Night Shyamalan movie where the best advice is to stay inside with the doors and windows shut.A tasteless, odorless toxin descends on the populace of the Northeast Coast of America, rendering them unable to process stimuli correctly, and which produces the end product of mass suicide. At least they're not killing each other...but the manners of death are new, gruesome, and inventive. Death by involuntarily offering oneself up to lions at the zoo. Death by industrial-strength lawn mower.Mark Wahlberg - the poor man's Matt Damon - enters into a flight away from the onset of the toxin with his wife, Zooey Deschanel, and the 8-year-old daughter of Mark's best friend, John Leguizamo, (spoiler) who exits early in the movie. Mark discovers that the toxin, air-borne, affects only sizable groups of people, so his flight includes only his family and a couple others. Circumstances whittles even this core group down, and after an epic journey, he, Zooey, and the little girl end up at the remote - and archaic - stone farmhouse of a peculiar old recluse woman, who puts them up reluctantly, and who unnerves Zooey.This movie struck similar chords as did ""Signs"", and was reinforced by the same sort of eerie music. A pervasive feeling of dread soaks into this movie, but in reality the plot doesn't really go anywhere, and reaches no complete resolution, unlike the better ""Signs"", while resembling it in style.I liked three of Mr. Shyalaman's movies - The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village - but haven't been impressed by his last couple. I stayed with this movie, hoping for explanation, but it never really got there. Mark Wahlberg played a good part, as did Zooey Deschanel, but as a couple, they weren't totally believable.

Dowling,"[9, 10]","Maybe I'm the last one standing, but I am a rabid fan of Shyamalan and his obsession with taking horror/fantasy stories and giving them an A-list treatment.  In ""The Happening"", Shyamalan tells the story of a high school teacher (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife (Zooey Daschanel) getting caught up in a catatrophic event where people fall under an unseen force that drives them to suicide.  ""The Happening"" was ravaged by critics, and while it made a tidy profit at the box office, it was not the blockbuster Shyamalan has become accustomed to.  This is a shame, because it is an accomplished and skillfull thriller that is very creepy and touching, and it does have the distinction of being his first R-rated feature (the gore is quite gruesome).  I like the way Shyamalan portrays the possible end of days, very quiet, sudden, and hitting hard before people even realize the seriousness of their situation.  The film blames toxins secreted by plants into the air as a strike against man for their cruel ways . . .sounds like the stuff of B-movies, which it is, but Shyamalan takes this story and puts the experience through the eyes of ordinary people (just as in Signs), making it chilling, very relatable, and suspenseful.  Mark Wahlberg is excellent in the lead.  He never becomes an action superhero or unrealistically smart, but instead his character's heroism somes from how he safeguards his wife and his best friend's daughter whom is charged with watching.  The Blu ray edition of this film is excellent.  Presented in 1080p, 1:85 aspect, the film demonstrates good color saturation, inky blacks, and strong detail.  The veneer of film grain renders further details in fabrics, facial features, and textures.  The DTS-MA HD lossless soundtrack is robust, sometimes bass-heavy, which superv ambient effects, especially in handling the wind gusts an rustling trees on the soundtrack.  Dialogue is clear, albeit soft, which is a Shyamalan trademark.  Special features are generally good and offer some insight, but a commentary would have been awesome.

To have love or need love or to need or be needed by someone is to have purpose. It drives us but subconsiously we do not know it. The reason the couple lived was because the represented units that actually need each other to live. There are people in this world that require such and cannot sustain themselves alone. Yet there are those who go about life without ever getting to have that need fulfilled. Perhaps the producer created a scenerio where only people who really loved or rather relied on each other for survival were immune from the whatever toxin.

For the most part, I wanted there to be more to it. I never did fully understand what the big deal was about the 'smaller groups being safer' idea. I am really glad that aliens didn't have something to do with what was taking place.Zooey Deschanel's character was annoying and her look/eyes were unnatural and freaky in the beginning; Wahlberg was okay. How about when those folks in that house stuck there guns out the window and shot the kids who were trying to get in. The people didn't want to open the door or have anything in the wind coming in...so, if they were so afraid, why would they even point there guns out the window? And the scene where the dude was just there letting the animal rip his arms off and he had no reaction of pain...puh-leez.At the end, when the man & woman left their buildings, risking death just to be with each other, I paused the scene and thought of how it might end:The problem was stated to begin in parks. Philadelphia; New York; big areas. I began to think that the plants in those areas were reacting to all of the violence nearby; like, they could feel 'energy' in those high-crime locations. That the plants evolved to 'realize' that we were a threat because of our violence towards each other.Now, the man and the woman really seemed to love each other and I was thinking that nature would 'feel' that they were safe around those two and wouldn't harm them. Love had saved them; love/kindness can save us.I figured that the mood ring that the man was wearing would have something to do with it; that they'd show it and it would be the color for love (whatever that would be). It would have made more sense to me if that was an ending. That would make the 'safer in smaller groups' idea sensible, too; less people...less chance of differences/anger?Instead, we learn later that, a minute before they went outside, the phenomenon just stopped for some reason. It was just something that happened in nature that we can't explain.

The concept was great, and the beginning of the movie is very creepy.Here's the flaws though:1. Besides John Leguizamo, the acting is absolutely awful. Zooey Deschanel is a horrible actress and makes any attempt at a love subplot impossible to believe or connect to. Whenever there was a scene that I could tell was supposed to make me think ""aw, that's nice, good for them!"" I ended up just thinking ""who cares?""2. A ""guess"" by a random farmer turns out to be the actual reason the ""happening"" is even happening. You would think all of the guesses early on in the movie would be plausible and then the REAL reason would turn out to be mind-blowing. This was not the case though, and it was very disappointing to have the mystery solved so early and so easily.3. The reason for the ""happening"" is (I won't spoil it, although I'm using that word loosely) simply cheesy. A part of me was thinking ""well, at least he took a risk and gave us a good message"" but the other part of me couldn't help but overpower that with ""that was just too cheesy for me."" It reminded me of Godzilla vs. The Smog Monster - great message, but just too ridiculous to really connect with anyone.4. M. Night Shyamalan is a great filmmaker. That may sound like a positive, but when you're expecting a great film from a great filmmaker, anything less is disappointing. I thought The Lady in the Water was a bit cheesy, but excused it since it's supposed to be ""a bedtime story"". This movie just has no excuse though, and I really hope he thinks long and hard about his next move.

1183835,A1L9MIIBI7409N,B001DZOC3W,"G. YEO ""gyeo""","[1, 2]","With The Happening, M Night Shyamalan straddles the line between B-movie (the trees are attacking!) psychological drama (there's something happening in the wind!) and a theatrical play, and how one enjoys this film will depend on how you view those nuances.  All the reviews here are accurate and they reflect one's own expectations.  You will either love, hate, or feel that this is a bland production.  Knowing that it was M. Night - a director who marches to his own beat - I had no expectations for anything big.Trademark to M. Night's style is realism. He does not rely on wham-bam special effects to amp up the action, hence the characters are key to holding the whole story together.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, and Zooey Deschanel put in compelling, empathic performances as the people who are trapped in a situation they don't understand.(The closest parallel to The Happening would probably be Spielberg's War of the Worlds, minus the special effects and set in a small town.)I hadn't seen an M. Night film since the Village, but his style hasn't changed one bit.  So if you saw that, and you watched Unbreakable, well, this is in the same vein.  His characters remain mysterious and intriguing, while his story arcs need work. M. Night isn't one for a big climactic reveal either.So, while THE HAPPENING is average as a thriller, it actually succeeds in being depressing and disturbing for a mix of reasons - there's no solution in sight and people are powerless in this lifetime to do anything.  While touching perhaps on an existential chord but not quite pressing all the right buttons, Mr Shyamalan needs to work harder at his storytelling somewhere (Robert Mckee of Story fame would attest to that).He continues to be a quirky auteur in Hollywood genres, but many like me are how long he's going to last with his brand of moviemaking.  He continues to defy the formula, and I can't help feeling he really wants to be more distinct like Director Nicholas Roeg (""Don't Look Now"") or Canadian director Atom Egoyan.His character driven pieces seem to suit a smaller medium like TV better, and he should really be directing episodes of the Twilight Zone if that series was ever revived.",3,The Acting Works Well...,1249084800,"08 1, 2009",2009,2201,"['Happening', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'line', 'B-movie', 'trees', 'are', 'attacking', 'psychological', 'drama', 'something', 'happening', 'wind', 'theatrical', 'play', 'how', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'depend', 'how', 'view', 'nuances', 'reviews', 'here', 'are', 'accurate', 'reflect', 'one', 'own', 'expectations', 'will', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'feel', 'bland', 'production', 'Knowing', 'was', 'M.', 'Night', 'director', 'who', 'own', 'beat', 'had', 'expectations', 'anything', 'big.Trademark', 'M.', 'Night', 'style', 'realism', 'not', 'rely', 'wham-bam', 'special', 'effects', 'amp', 'up', 'action', 'hence', 'characters', 'are', 'key', 'holding', 'whole', 'story', 'together', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'put', 'compelling', 'empathic', 'performances', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', 'situation', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'closest', 'parallel', 'Happening', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'minus', 'special', 'effects', 'set', 'small', 'town', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'M.', 'Night', 'film', 'Village', 'style', ""n't"", 'changed', 'one', 'bit', 'So', 'saw', 'watched', 'Unbreakable', 'well', 'same', 'vein', 'characters', 'remain', 'mysterious', 'intriguing', 'story', 'arcs', 'need', 'work', 'M.', 'Night', ""n't"", 'one', 'big', 'climactic', 'reveal', 'either.So', 'HAPPENING', 'average', 'thriller', 'actually', 'being', 'depressing', 'disturbing', 'mix', 'reasons', 'solution', 'sight', 'people', 'are', 'powerless', 'lifetime', 'do', 'anything', 'touching', 'perhaps', 'existential', 'chord', 'not', 'quite', 'pressing', 'right', 'buttons', 'Mr', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'harder', 'storytelling', 'somewhere', 'Robert', 'Mckee', 'Story', 'fame', 'would', 'attest', 'be', 'quirky', 'auteur', 'Hollywood', 'genres', 'many', 'are', 'how', 'long', 'going', 'last', 'brand', 'moviemaking', 'defy', 'formula', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'really', 'be', 'more', 'distinct', 'Director', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Now', 'Canadian', 'director', 'Atom', 'Egoyan.His', 'character', 'driven', 'pieces', 'seem', 'suit', 'smaller', 'medium', 'TV', 'better', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'directing', 'episodes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'was', 'ever', 'revived']",N/A

Touted as his first ""R-Rated Movie"" (which was the biggest pile of marketing spin I've seen in a long time) - we went into this with high hopes that he could redeem himself from lackluster movies since The Sixth Sense.M. Night's movies are really hit/miss (and most people seem to choose miss). I hope we can all agree thatThe Sixth Sense [Blu-ray] is by far the best of the set and well worth getting on Blu-ray. Great movie with the always enjoyable Bruce Willis and Toni Collette, and pretty much the movie that kicked off Haley Joel Osmet's career.After that we had Unbreakable, which I actually enjoyed but most people were left wanting something more. Signs was next and I remember it more because of the parody in Scary Movie 3 than for the real movie itself - in fact for a long time I thought Simon Rex was in the real movie instead of Joaquin Phoenix. Alas...I liked The Village - mostly because Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron Howard) was awesome. I loved the plot twist, and I loved the tension I felt watching it. Very effective, although many people say it was predictable right from the beginning. Lady in the Water came next, and I just didn't get it. I was waiting for the twist that never happened, and the storytelling was too slow.So then we're given The Happening. What a piece of junk (did I mention this already?). It was painful to watch Zooey Deschanel try to act. I am totally in love with her sister who is the star of Bones, but come on...Zooey doesn't need to follow in the family path. She was painful to watch in The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and even more so in The Happening. You could almost tell that Marky Mark was struggling to work with her. He really wanted to be believable, but frankly someone needed to direct him.Plot points were crap, writing was crap, dialogue and acting was crap. We got to the end of it and we could barely function.""Did we really just watch that?"" and ""What the h*ll was that?"" were repeated phrases in our living room. What a ridiculous mess. There was so much potential here of people suddenly killing themselves in various odd ways, but when we find out that it's because of the plants, it's like...why? Why are we watching this? Is this why they advertised it as an R-Rated movie, because if that's all it's got going for it...It makes no sense - the plants kill us when we are in groups so we split up into smaller groups, but they still kill us when we're in smaller groups? WTF? What's the motivation of the plants?

1183843,A21XG7UVD2ABKS,B001DZOC3W,Jack R. Tallent,"[9, 11]","This M. Night Shyamalan fan finds no joy in judging ""The Happening"" to be the director's first bona fide DUD. (Especially since his good films have received a great deal of unfair criticism.)But a dud it is. To avoid giving anything away, I will illustrate the film's problems by comparing it to another M.N.S work that is, in some ways, quite similar-- ""Signs."" (Which was a really great film, by the way, so if you haven't seen THAT one, spoilers do, in fact, lie ahead.)Remember that great pivotal scene in ""Signs"" when Graham (Mel Gibson) is talking to Merrill (Joachin Phoenix)? He says to him,""People break down into two groups when they experience something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign, evidence, that there is someone up there, watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance.""Then, remember AFTER the film, when you thought back over everything? You thought, ""If Bo hadn't had that weird germ phobia, there wouldn't have been all those glasses of water...and if Morgan hadn't had asthma... and if Merrill hadn't failed at baseball.. and if the mother hadn't died and said those dying words...."" How GREAT that was, and you realized THAT was the point of the film. All the other stuff was window dressing.Well, imagine if ""Signs"" hadn't had that fascinating theme that made it great. Take all that away, and you are left with... ""The Happening.""""The Happening"" is what ""Signs"" would have been if it had just been about aliens landing one day and then leaving a few days later.Doesn't sound so great does it? Well, it's not. To be fair, the film seemed promising until the end, at which point you realized there wasn't any more. At points, there was a great deal of tension, and there were some excellent creepy scenes with Betty Buckley (the mom from ""Eight is Enough"".) I was even on board with the dialog, which, at the beginning, seemed downright odd, but my faith in M.N.S assured me that it was all for a reason. (Besides, much of it was due to Mark Wahlberg, who has this odd delivery style where he always sounds like an earnest 13 year old.) After a while, I felt it started to work, and there were scenes where it did, in fact, work quite well. As far as John Lequizamo goes, the best I can say is he is not in the whole movie. I really did not like him in this role.Which is just another way this film is very unlike the rest of the M.N.S canon: his casting has always been spot on, and one of his greatest skills has been in making his actors superbly effective. Even his usual magic with child actors is noticeably absent in this film.So there you go, M.N.S fans. It brings me no joy to bring this news, but there it is.

I'd have preferred a wider focus on the world rather than the gradual zooming in on Marky Mark, and a more ambiguous message, if any.

If the message was nature's natural defense instinct, a kind of revenge against humanity, what does one human's love for another mean? Nothing, that's what.

1183845,A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB,B001DZOC3W,Jake,"[2, 4]","I must state up front that I am a big M. Night Shyamalan fan. I'm especially partial to both Signs and The Village, which in my mind are pure genius. Every time one of his films is released I'm always amazed at the slaughter that ensues from both fans and critics alike. Make no mistake about, people love to hate this guy and I just don't get it. I believe that Shyamalan is one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time and I'm always anxiously awaiting his next offering.As I read early reviews on The Happening, I was actually very hopeful because they were so negative. Everyone told me to avoid Lady in the Water and I really enjoyed it. Surely it was going to be the same with Shyamalan's latest right? I was going to discover once again that for some reason I'm one of the only film buffs on the planet that can truly recognize good filmmaking when I see it. As much as it pains me, I must concede that for once everybody else was right. I wanted to love this movie. I wanted to find greatness where no one else could, but it bums me to admit that it's nowhere to be found.It seems that the story and more specifically, the antagonists bothered most critics and reviewers. I actually thought the story was interesting and I could even buy the bizarre explanation for what was happening. However, I really feel like for the first time that Shyamalan really missed the mark with his plot execution. The movie starts out on the right notes, sucking us into the story with chilling sequences and clever suspense. Unfortunately, the film peaks early and leaves us with very little to pull the story along.Mark Whalberg's performance was especially disappointing. He tried way too hard to make his character seem soft-spoken and damaged. Instead, all he did was give us a character that was incredibly annoying and whiny throughout the film. Zooey Deschanel only proved what she's proven in all of her other films: she's a weird chick and can only play weird chicks in movies. The rest of the cast was just OK at best, and this is the first Shyamalan film where I felt the casting was done poorly. I dare say the film would have been better off casting the other Whalberg brother and the other Deschanel sister.The Happening is Shyamalan's first Rated R film and it's very obvious. It reminded me of what happened when George Lucas finally got his hands on CGI for Star Wars Episodes I-III. The films looked spectacular, but somewhere along the way Lucas forgot what made the original trilogy so timeless: the story! The Happening showcases some of Shyamalan's most frightening scenes to date and he makes good use of the R rating. Unfortunately, it seems he was so focused on making parts of this film as scary as he could that he neglected the all-important plot.I haven't given up hope on M. Night Shyamalan and I do believe he will wow us again.

Cut to Marky Mark, a high school teacher in Philly who is making his kids fail their SATs by filling their heads with nonsense about disappearing bees. Are the bees related? What do you think? When the news of this potential bio-terrorist attack hits the school, Mark decides for some reason to get on a train with his not-quite-clear-how-estanged wife. More deaths follow, the train stops en route.A bunch of third-tier characters kill themselves in imaginatively gruesome ways and Mark uses his science teaching skills to figure out the virus is highly communicable and travels through the air. Genius. A botanist whom he happens across tells him: it's the plants - they've had enough of our non-recycling polluting ways and oak trees are throwing the kill switch on humans. And he believes that. So what better way to escape than with a bunch of strangers spending the next 20 minutes of screen time walking across a field? More people die, surprisingly enough, and their group gets ever-smaller. Wahlberg's performance here spawned a series of sketches in SNL where he talks to chickens and road signs, it's just that good.Finally they reach the house of a crazy old hermit woman who harasses the hell out of them, forcing some high school-level acting from almost everyone in the same scene. She dies too. In a relationship moment, Mark's wife tells him about some tiramisu she ate with another guy and wonders if that's cheating. The next day, they leave the house and mysteriously the virus has completely gone, just like the $10 from my wallet and *just like a scientist on a TV report at the beginning said it would*. They live.In the epilogue set in Paris (the first time M has stepped outside of Philly for a long time), stereotypical French people are walking next to the Eiffel Tower, carrying baguettes and garlic and probably smoking too.

1183848,A2CSEAGXAPQ0Z4,B001DZOC3W,James S.,"[5, 8]","*SPOILER ALERT*A sad, ghastly, and ultimately self-indulgent film, rife with Shyamalan's trademark arrogance that was so prominently on display in his last two bombs, The Village and Lady in the Water: scenes of mass suicide that are intended to shock, but instead transcend mean-spiritedness; an unforgivable reference to 9/11, as construction workers leap to their deaths, the sounds of their bodies hitting the pavement on the soundtrack; and a premise so full of self-importance, so pious and lofty, that it inspires unintended laughter.  Let's not forget the banal, flat-line dialogue, poured on so thick that you can almost see Mark Wahlberg--an otherwise gifted actor--actually slipping into his wading-boots.  And don't even get me started on the impossible choice offered to John Leguizamo's character about a third of the way through the movie.  No father would ever, in the infinite amount of space and time, make the decision that his character makes; not when it involves leaving his young daughter in someone else's hands in order to dive heedlessly into harms way to find a wife who may or may not still be alive.  The finale to that particular plot thread is a shameless ploy--ingratiated on us by Shymalan--meant to drag out the tears kicking and screaming.  I wanted to kick the TV instead.  I think it's time that Shyamalan finally gives up and faces the fact that he'll never be a truly important filmmaker until he finds a way to extricate his ego from his material.",1,(so little) Happening,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,1487,"['*SPOILER', 'ALERT*A', 'sad', 'ghastly', 'ultimately', 'self-indulgent', 'film', 'rife', 'Shyamalan', 'trademark', 'arrogance', 'was', 'so', 'prominently', 'display', 'last', 'two', 'bombs', 'Village', 'Lady', 'Water', 'scenes', 'mass', 'suicide', 'are', 'intended', 'shock', 'instead', 'transcend', 'mean-spiritedness', 'unforgivable', 'reference', '9/11', 'construction', 'workers', 'leap', 'deaths', 'sounds', 'bodies', 'hitting', 'pavement', 'soundtrack', 'premise', 'so', 'full', 'self-importance', 'so', 'pious', 'lofty', 'unintended', 'laughter', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'banal', 'flat-line', 'dialogue', 'poured', 'so', 'thick', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'otherwise', 'gifted', 'actor', 'actually', 'slipping', 'wading-boots', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'started', 'impossible', 'choice', 'offered', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'character', 'third', 'way', 'movie', 'father', 'would', 'ever', 'infinite', 'amount', 'space', 'time', 'make', 'decision', 'character', 'not', 'when', 'leaving', 'young', 'daughter', 'someone', 'else', 'hands', 'order', 'dive', 'heedlessly', 'harms', 'way', 'find', 'wife', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'still', 'be', 'alive', 'finale', 'particular', 'plot', 'thread', 'shameless', 'ploy', 'ingratiated', 'Shymalan', 'meant', 'drag', 'out', 'tears', 'kicking', 'screaming', 'wanted', 'kick', 'TV', 'instead', 'think', 'time', 'Shyamalan', 'finally', 'up', 'fact', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'truly', 'important', 'filmmaker', 'way', 'extricate', 'ego', 'material']",N/A
1183849,A21H1P3QQ6WEX6,B001DZOC3W,James Thomas Jeans,"[0, 1]","(BEWARE MINOR SPOILERS)I was dragged to the cinema to watch this tonight, and although I didn't fuss too much as I was mildly interested in watching it, I came out of the theater wishing I'd been able to slip out and watch 'Iron Man' or 'The Incredible Hulk' instead.Keeping in mind that I haven't seen 'Lady in the Water', I have to say this was easily M. Night's weakest film. It's well directed and there are some really shocking moments, but several of those moments managed to draw unintentional laughter from the audience.The script is a mess, and the characters are probably the least developed of any character created by M. Night. This film could have worked as a character drama (like Signs), but there wasn't enough time dedicated to the people we were following. The cause for ""the happening"" is interesting, but there's little logic in how it works. If the planet wants to poison the humans to death, why does it wait for groups of people to gather? Why doesn't it just err on the side of caution and produce a world wide dose of neuro-toxins and take everyone out in one fell swoop?Mark Wahlberg is horribly miscast. Generally speaking I like him, but the nice guy character he plays in this film doesn't ring true. He's trying too hard to be a cuddly Biology professor, and it never feels genuine.Leguizamo gives a good performance, but he's criminally underused. His character needed about 20 minutes more development.Zooey Deschanel is perfect in the role of a meek, flaky estranged wife. She brings a warmth to the character that may have been missing had they cast someone else in the role. But again we have a performer who is criminally underused. The subplot revolving around her broken marriage to Whalberg's character isn't nearly as well rounded as the broken family life of Mel Gibson's character in Signs. In point of fact, this particular subplot should have been the meat of the film because all the stuff with the world striking back doesn't have the strength to carry the film.(And if I may have a moment to ramble, I must comment on Zooey's eyes: this woman has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen, but I find it hard to look into them for too long on the big screen. It's like looking into the Ark of the Covenant -- the longer I look into them, the more I expect my face to melt off or my head to explode. Her eyes are like rich blue oceans, and I suspect M. Night agrees because there are a TON of extreme close-ups on Zooey's face.)On another note, I have to confess that nothing irritates me more than misleading marketing, and in the case of The Happening, the marketing for this intensely misleading. Everything I've seen suggests that the film revolves around an apocalypse, but it doesn't. Only the Eastern seaboard is affected, and it only lasts for 24 hours. This film feels like a preface to a bigger disaster on the horizon, which is fine, but it feels like a slap in the face after seeing the film advertised as a movie about the end of the world.The violence and gore in the film is a bit jarring, particularly considering M. Night has only done PG-13 films up to now, but M. Night directs it really well. It's a pity that his scripts seem to get weaker and weaker with each film, because he's a genuinely good director. He knows how to set up tension. I hope he has a better script for The Last Airbender.James Newton Howard is on top form this time around, composing a score that revolves around a central motif that's the eeriest he's written since the theme for Signs. If this is out on CD, I will be buying it.Over all, I think this was a pretty mediocre film. There are some genuinely good moments in the film, but their buried in the fallout of a barely coherent script. M. Night's direction is strong, but the story can barely sustain it's hour and thirty minute run time. This would have been better off as an episode of Fear Itself (or as a part of some other anthology series).There was no twist this time, but I saw the ending coming a mile away, and I think this film probably could have done with a bit of a twist. If you're a fan of M. Night's work, you'll probably want to see this. If you're not, you'll probably want to rent it or wait to see it on satellite.",3,"Good direction, but a train wreck of a script holds it down",1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,4227,"['BEWARE', 'MINOR', 'SPOILERS', 'was', 'dragged', 'cinema', 'watch', 'tonight', 'did', ""n't"", 'fuss', 'too', 'much', 'was', 'mildly', 'interested', 'watching', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'wishing', ""'d"", 'been', 'able', 'slip', 'out', 'watch', ""'Iron"", 'Man', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'instead.Keeping', 'mind', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', ""'Lady"", 'Water', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'easily', 'M.', 'Night', 'weakest', 'film', 'well', 'directed', 'are', 'really', 'shocking', 'moments', 'several', 'moments', 'managed', 'draw', 'unintentional', 'laughter', 'audience.The', 'script', 'mess', 'characters', 'are', 'probably', 'least', 'developed', 'character', 'created', 'M.', 'Night', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'worked', 'character', 'drama', 'Signs', 'there', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'time', 'dedicated', 'people', 'were', 'following', 'cause', 'happening', 'interesting', 'little', 'logic', 'how', 'planet', 'poison', 'humans', 'death', 'why', 'wait', 'groups', 'people', 'gather', 'Why', ""n't"", 'just', 'err', 'side', 'caution', 'produce', 'world', 'wide', 'dose', 'neuro-toxins', 'take', 'everyone', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'horribly', 'miscast', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'nice', 'guy', 'character', 'film', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'cuddly', 'Biology', 'professor', 'never', 'genuine.Leguizamo', 'good', 'performance', 'criminally', 'underused', 'character', 'needed', '20', 'minutes', 'more', 'development.Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'perfect', 'role', 'meek', 'flaky', 'estranged', 'wife', 'warmth', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'had', 'cast', 'someone', 'else', 'role', 'again', 'have', 'performer', 'who', 'criminally', 'underused', 'subplot', 'revolving', 'broken', 'marriage', 'Whalberg', 'character', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'well', 'rounded', 'broken', 'family', 'life', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'character', 'Signs', 'point', 'fact', 'particular', 'subplot', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'meat', 'film', 'stuff', 'world', 'striking', 'back', ""n't"", 'have', 'strength', 'carry', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'moment', 'ramble', 'must', 'comment', 'Zooey', 'eyes', 'woman', 'most', 'beautiful', 'eyes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'find', 'hard', 'look', 'too', 'long', 'big', 'screen', 'looking', 'Ark', 'Covenant', 'longer', 'look', 'more', 'expect', 'face', 'melt', 'off', 'head', 'explode', 'eyes', 'are', 'rich', 'blue', 'oceans', 'suspect', 'M.', 'Night', 'are', 'TON', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'Zooey', 'face', 'note', 'have', 'confess', 'nothing', 'more', 'misleading', 'marketing', 'case', 'Happening', 'marketing', 'intensely', 'misleading', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'apocalypse', ""n't"", 'Only', 'Eastern', 'seaboard', 'affected', 'only', '24', 'hours', 'film', 'feels', 'preface', 'bigger', 'disaster', 'horizon', 'fine', 'slap', 'face', 'seeing', 'film', 'advertised', 'movie', 'end', 'world.The', 'violence', 'gore', 'film', 'bit', 'jarring', 'particularly', 'considering', 'M.', 'Night', 'only', 'done', 'PG-13', 'films', 'now', 'M.', 'Night', 'really', 'well', 'pity', 'scripts', 'seem', 'get', 'weaker', 'weaker', 'film', 'genuinely', 'good', 'director', 'how', 'set', 'up', 'tension', 'hope', 'better', 'script', 'Last', 'Airbender.James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'top', 'form', 'time', 'around', 'composing', 'score', 'central', 'motif', 'eeriest', 'written', 'theme', 'Signs', 'out', 'CD', 'will', 'be', 'buying', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'mediocre', 'film', 'are', 'genuinely', 'good', 'moments', 'film', 'buried', 'fallout', 'barely', 'coherent', 'script', 'M.', 'Night', 'direction', 'strong', 'story', 'can', 'barely', 'sustain', 'hour', 'thirty', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'off', 'episode', 'Fear', 'Itself', 'part', 'other', 'anthology', 'series', '.There', 'was', 'twist', 'time', 'saw', 'ending', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'think', 'film', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'bit', 'twist', ""'re"", 'fan', 'M.', 'Night', 'work', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'see', ""'re"", 'not', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'want', 'rent', 'wait', 'see', 'satellite']",N/A
1183850,A366S12KCZ280V,B001DZOC3W,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[3, 3]","""The Happening"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan seems to be disliked a lot by many of the reviewers here. As a result it doesn't score high at all in the star ratings. I feel however that many of these reviewers are a bit to harsh in their judgment of this film. Yes ""The Happening"" is not in the same league as Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"". Still I think this is a better movie then most people give it credit. It is certainly I feel a better movie then ""Lady In The Water"" which is my least favorite film by Shyamalan.Shyamalan does a good job of telling a story here about something in the air that is affecting people so they go silently mad to the point of committing suicide. It all happens in the northeast part of the country. No one at first knows what is happening or why people are killing themselves at an alarming rate. At first it is believed it is the work of terrorists releasing some kind of bio-chemical in the air. But in time it comes to find out that it might be the plants and trees that are releasing something into the air causing all the chaos. I know the plot may sound a bit way out there but I find it to work. As the movie goes along the tension builds as people try to understand and solve the situation. As the film moves along people find more and more ways to kill themselves from sticking hairpicks into their jugular vain to jumping of buildings to laying down in front of a moving lawn mower to other gruesome forms of death. The scene where a man walks into the lions cage at the zoo quickly becomes blood curdling and could evoke screams from the viewer. I give this movie 4 stars because of the tense plot and suspense that builds up as the story goes along.At the same time I only give the film 4 stars because I agree with some of the other reviewers that the acting is not the greatest. Mark Wahlberg, a fine actor to be sure, gives an ok performance but to me there are moments where he seems to be just going through the motions in his performance. Zooey Deschanel who plays Wahlberg's wife gives just a so-so performance but she too seems at times to be going through the motions. Betty Buckley however gives a good performance as Mrs. Jones and John Leguizamo also does a fine job as well. This is not an outstanding movie but still one I can recommend. Saying that however and knowing that there are many out there who totally disagree with me on this movie I would recommend before you buy ""The Happening"" you rent it or check it out at your local library and watch it first before you decide if you want to add this to your own video library.",4,Come On Guys It's Not THAT Bad Of A Movie,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,2608,"['Happening', 'directed', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'be', 'disliked', 'lot', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'result', ""n't"", 'score', 'high', 'star', 'ratings', 'feel', 'however', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'bit', 'harsh', 'judgment', 'film', 'Yes', 'Happening', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'Shyamalan', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Unbreakable', 'Still', 'think', 'better', 'movie', 'then', 'most', 'people', 'give', 'credit', 'certainly', 'feel', 'better', 'movie', 'then', 'Lady', 'Water', 'least', 'favorite', 'film', 'Shyamalan.Shyamalan', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'here', 'something', 'air', 'affecting', 'people', 'go', 'silently', 'mad', 'point', 'committing', 'suicide', 'northeast', 'part', 'country', 'one', 'first', 'knows', 'what', 'happening', 'why', 'people', 'are', 'killing', 'alarming', 'rate', 'first', 'believed', 'work', 'terrorists', 'releasing', 'kind', 'bio-chemical', 'air', 'time', 'find', 'out', 'might', 'be', 'plants', 'trees', 'are', 'releasing', 'something', 'air', 'causing', 'chaos', 'know', 'plot', 'may', 'sound', 'bit', 'way', 'there', 'find', 'work', 'movie', 'tension', 'people', 'try', 'understand', 'solve', 'situation', 'film', 'along', 'people', 'find', 'more', 'more', 'ways', 'kill', 'sticking', 'hairpicks', 'jugular', 'vain', 'jumping', 'buildings', 'laying', 'down', 'front', 'moving', 'lawn', 'mower', 'other', 'gruesome', 'forms', 'death', 'scene', 'where', 'man', 'lions', 'cage', 'zoo', 'quickly', 'blood', 'curdling', 'could', 'evoke', 'screams', 'viewer', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'tense', 'plot', 'suspense', 'up', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'only', 'give', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'acting', 'not', 'greatest', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'fine', 'actor', 'be', 'sure', 'ok', 'performance', 'are', 'moments', 'where', 'be', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'performance', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'who', 'Wahlberg', 'wife', 'just', 'so-so', 'performance', 'too', 'times', 'be', 'going', 'motions', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'however', 'good', 'performance', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'still', 'one', 'can', 'recommend', 'Saying', 'however', 'knowing', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'totally', 'disagree', 'movie', 'would', 'recommend', 'buy', 'Happening', 'rent', 'check', 'out', 'local', 'library', 'watch', 'first', 'decide', 'want', 'add', 'own', 'video', 'library']",N/A
1183851,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B001DZOC3W,Jason,"[1, 2]","There are forces at work beyond our understanding, like those behind the casting director's ability to get any semi-competent actor to take part in this garbage.  Another unexplained force would be, considering the last good movie he made was Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan's popularity.  With enough pseudo-science about plant-life having self-preservation mechanism, and the ability to launch airborne neurotoxins from their spores, or something like that, this movie may as well have been the sequel to The Inconvenient Truth.Poor speech and disorientation are the first signs of this floral terrorist attack, meaning Bobcat Goldwaithe and drunks walking out of bars would be in serious danger.  A decent cast with Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel, as Elliot and Alma Moore, is the only reason to watch this film.  Given nearly nothing script-wise by writer/director M. Night, the acting is nonetheless very intense.  Seriously, the script is the stuff of bar napkins.  Better yet, graffiti scribblings on toilet walls.  If not for a series of shocking suicides, which are, admittedly, jaw-dropping, the movie serves as nothing more than environmental mumbo-jumbo.  If Shyamalan wanted to make plants and wind scary (which they absolutely weren't in this film), he should have taken a page from The Ruins or The Wizard of Oz, respectively.Ten reasons this movie sucks (there could easily be more):1) The man vs. lion scene is atrociously done, so fake I gave myself a migraine when I rolled my eyes.2) Suspense requires, well, suspense.  Telling the surprise ending at the beginning is stupid.  Why not just show Bruce Willis as a ghost in the first scene of The Sixth Sense?3) When there is a lovelorn subplot involving the two main characters of the film, and it's given absolutely no depth, it should be left on the cutting-room floor.4) When a train stops in the upper NE of the U.S., the reason given is that they've lost contact with, ""everyone.""  Given that the effects of this ""outbreak"" only attacked the same region, why would they stop when they could easily contact the rest of America, let alone the rest of the world.5) People can't outrun the wind.6) When escaping from the wind, it's wise to know that old houses have very poor insulation7) The over-the-top preaching about humans destroying the planet is insufferable.  I'm going to drive my SUV through a wheat field just to spite Shyamalan.8) The psychotic, reclusive yokel Mrs. Jones is a pointless addition, and if anything, should have been spared by the film's ""logic.""9) Pointless plot insertions like a communications pipe between Mrs. Jones main house and a shed outback is sloppily inserted just for future use later.  The same goes for everyone in the film with a gun.10) Aside from constantly being in the running for Razzies, this film has the distinct pleasure of easily having one of the worst ten endings in cinema history.",2,When plants attack,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,2910,"['are', 'forces', 'work', 'understanding', 'casting', 'director', 'ability', 'get', 'semi-competent', 'actor', 'take', 'part', 'garbage', 'unexplained', 'force', 'would', 'be', 'considering', 'last', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'was', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'M', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'popularity', 'enough', 'pseudo-science', 'plant-life', 'having', 'self-preservation', 'mechanism', 'ability', 'launch', 'airborne', 'neurotoxins', 'spores', 'something', 'movie', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'sequel', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth.Poor', 'speech', 'disorientation', 'are', 'first', 'signs', 'floral', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'meaning', 'Bobcat', 'Goldwaithe', 'drunks', 'walking', 'bars', 'would', 'be', 'serious', 'danger', 'decent', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Elliot', 'Alma', 'Moore', 'only', 'reason', 'watch', 'film', 'Given', 'nearly', 'nothing', 'script-wise', 'writer/director', 'M.', 'Night', 'acting', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'intense', 'Seriously', 'script', 'stuff', 'bar', 'napkins', 'Better', 'yet', 'graffiti', 'scribblings', 'toilet', 'walls', 'not', 'series', 'shocking', 'suicides', 'are', 'admittedly', 'jaw-dropping', 'movie', 'nothing', 'more', 'environmental', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'Shyamalan', 'wanted', 'make', 'plants', 'wind', 'scary', 'absolutely', 'were', ""n't"", 'film', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'page', 'Ruins', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'respectively.Ten', 'reasons', 'movie', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'more', ':1', 'man', 'vs.', 'lion', 'scene', 'atrociously', 'done', 'fake', 'gave', 'migraine', 'when', 'rolled', 'eyes.2', 'Suspense', 'well', 'suspense', 'Telling', 'surprise', 'ending', 'beginning', 'stupid', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'show', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'ghost', 'first', 'scene', 'Sixth', 'Sense', '3', 'When', 'lovelorn', 'subplot', 'involving', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'given', 'absolutely', 'depth', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'cutting-room', 'floor.4', 'When', 'train', 'stops', 'upper', 'NE', 'U.S.', 'reason', 'given', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'contact', 'everyone', 'effects', 'outbreak', 'only', 'attacked', 'same', 'region', 'why', 'would', 'stop', 'when', 'could', 'easily', 'contact', 'rest', 'America', 'let', 'alone', 'rest', 'world.5', 'People', 'ca', ""n't"", 'outrun', 'wind.6', 'When', 'escaping', 'wind', 'wise', 'know', 'old', 'houses', 'have', 'very', 'poor', 'insulation7', 'over-the-top', 'preaching', 'humans', 'destroying', 'planet', 'insufferable', ""'m"", 'going', 'drive', 'SUV', 'wheat', 'field', 'just', 'spite', 'Shyamalan.8', 'psychotic', 'reclusive', 'yokel', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'pointless', 'addition', 'anything', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'spared', 'film', 'logic', '9', 'Pointless', 'plot', 'insertions', 'communications', 'pipe', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'main', 'house', 'shed', 'outback', 'sloppily', 'inserted', 'just', 'future', 'use', 'later', 'same', 'everyone', 'film', 'gun.10', 'Aside', 'constantly', 'being', 'running', 'Razzies', 'film', 'distinct', 'pleasure', 'easily', 'having', 'one', 'worst', 'ten', 'endings', 'cinema', 'history']",N/A

An unseen force is causing people to suddenly become disorientated, lose the ability to speak and then commit suicide in creatively gruesome ways that richly deserve the first R rating Shyamalan has garnered. The fact that it first happens in New York City causes people to think initially that it is a terrorist attack. As the invisible ""plague"" spreads through other cities in the Northeast, that possibility becomes less likely.But of course there's an intimate story, one that revolves around high school science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) who has a nutty problem worrying that his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), is having an affair when all she did was enjoy a tiramisu one day with a guy named Joey, who keeps calling her. (Joey's voice is played by the writer-director.) Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo), with an eight-year-old daughter in tow, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), has the real problem, as his wife is not with him during the epidemic. He leaves his girl with the Moores to search for her. As the Moores and Jess bolt from Philadelphia by train, they become stuck in the small town of Filbert, as railroad communications have broken down, whereupon they seek help from one of the nuts, Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley).The film's problems are that given the blandness of the leading two Moores, the dialogue is bereft of wit. Nor can the formerly remarkable Zooey Deschanel save the pic, an actress who is still playing loopy roles as she did in Miguel Arteta's ""The Good Girl"" but who has lost her former cuteness with advancing years.I have no final thoughts to send this commentary out on. The Happening is a movie I know I will watch again, one that might even grow on me to the point I go from lukewarm appreciation all the way to full-blown love like I have with Shyamalan's Unbreakable. In the end, I really can't come up with a reason as to why, even with its problems, this feature affected me like it has.

There's no climax or good performances or suspense or monsters or fiends or even a twist ending.I sat through this truly disastrous movie and I couldn't find one saving grace. The trailers led you to believe this would be a sci-fi movie.And I'll have to admit, the first ten minutes start out promisingly: when people start killing themselves and talking babble. But then it stops. We're introduced to an embarassingl miscast Mark Walhberg portraying a science teacher. He talks about the dissapearance of bees. Could this be a clue as to what's happening in NYC--where people are killing themselves?Then we get the idea that maybe it has something to do with the wind. We see endless shots of wind stirring plants and leaves. and then we think: it must be the plants. But there's nothing remotely scary here either. We see shots of ordinary plants stirring in the wind. We see tree limbs moving around. We see Walhberg and his wife and friends running into houses to escape the wind.In one big moment, when the wind is approaching the group, Wahlberg turns to the camera for a big close-up as he hollars: ""Just a minute--I'm trying to figure this out.""That's when the few people in the theater where I saw this all cracked up. He was saying exactly what all of us were thinking. ""I'm trying to figure out what the heck is going on in this movie.""And then we suddenly see Walhberg and his wife and child living happily in NYC again and the streets are filled with traffic and people are all moving around again. What happened? Where did all the NYC corpses go? Why isn't the wind still killing everyone. Why was NYC and a few other places the only areas of the USA to have a killer wind/plants?There's no excitement or tension or suspense as we see people running from the wind. Nor are we given reasons why the wind/plants told people to kill themselves.This would make a terrific double-bill with that horror classic, HANDS OF MANOS that was so lovingly presented to us on the Mystery Science Fiction series. Both movies are so very bad but at least MANOS, in its own, cheap, demented way, tried to be sincere.

Capogrossi,"[8, 10]","This movie should be missed.A sad comment to have to make regarding a normally more skilled director.This was meant to be a serious, paranoid horror/sci-fi film. But, in this film, the acting and the script are shockingly bad...the lines of the film and the performances have this odd, UNINTENTIONAL slapstick/goofball style to them that glaringly doesnt fit. I am not sure what Shamalayan was going for with that, but it very much did NOT work. The silliness of the way the characters act in various scenes is in direct contrast to the supposed nationwide terror the characters are supposedly fleeing from. Awkward scenes and attempts at humour here and there arent funny, just awkward, because the entire script is so bad it's hard to tell what's an intentional joke and what isnt.For the high budget, interesting concept, and excellent cinematography this movie has, the acting from leads Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel is really bad and uninterested...(only John Leguizamo escapes relatively well in this film, he does the most decent job in the movie, even though he is only in it for a short time)And the other smaller roles in the film (especially the soldier that runs up, says some stuff, and then yells ""Cheese and Crackers!"")....Awful!!  The actors themselves seemed to hate the film, and this DOES come across in watching it, no matter how hard they try to play their roles)-especially true for Zooey Deschanel...Wahlberg seems perplexed in how to do this movie, he tries hard, but Deschanel does very little.Shymalayan's films do not rely on special effects and CGI monsters to display the horror of situations. His earlier films were famous for having more IMPLIED horror than shown horror. For that reason, his films have leaned heavily on the ACTORS to imply the correct tone for the film, and to show the EFFECTS of the horror through acting skills. Sixth Sense and Signs were very good examples of this. But, when the acting and script itself falls flat in a Shamalayan film, there's nothing else to run the film, and the movie, sadly, collapses.Ultimately, this is a study in seeing a great director crash and burn with a film. Seeing that this was written, produced, and directed by Shyamalan, the buck stops there. He always insists on complete creative control in his movies, and, sadly, when they crash and burn as bad as this one, he takes the blame.This movie ranks down there with ""Boogeyman"" as one of the worst ""horror/sci fi"" films of the last 5 years. I strongly hope Shamalayan can come back, but he needs to take a break for a couple of years and get his bearings again. This film was, sadly, an epic failure.Sorry...It isnt worth buying on DVD.I rented it...for FREE...and I still dont want to ever see it again.Just go watch ""Signs"" if you havent seen it...the same type of film, but done 20 times better.",1,Shyamalan's worst film,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",2008,2837,"['movie', 'should', 'be', 'missed.A', 'sad', 'comment', 'have', 'make', 'regarding', 'normally', 'more', 'skilled', 'director.This', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'serious', 'paranoid', 'horror/sci-fi', 'film', 'film', 'acting', 'script', 'are', 'shockingly', 'bad', 'lines', 'film', 'performances', 'have', 'odd', 'UNINTENTIONAL', 'slapstick/goofball', 'style', 'glaringly', 'doesnt', 'fit', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Shamalayan', 'was', 'going', 'very', 'much', 'did', 'NOT', 'work', 'silliness', 'way', 'characters', 'act', 'various', 'scenes', 'direct', 'contrast', 'supposed', 'nationwide', 'terror', 'characters', 'are', 'supposedly', 'fleeing', 'Awkward', 'scenes', 'attempts', 'humour', 'here', 'there', 'arent', 'funny', 'just', 'awkward', 'entire', 'script', 'so', 'bad', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'intentional', 'joke', 'what', 'isnt.For', 'high', 'budget', 'interesting', 'concept', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'movie', 'acting', 'leads', 'Wahlberg', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'really', 'bad', 'uninterested', 'only', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'relatively', 'well', 'film', 'most', 'decent', 'job', 'movie', 'even', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'other', 'smaller', 'roles', 'film', 'especially', 'soldier', 'up', 'stuff', 'then', 'Cheese', 'Crackers', '.Awful', 'actors', 'seemed', 'hate', 'film', 'DOES', 'come', 'watching', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'try', 'play', 'roles', '-especially', 'true', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'Wahlberg', 'perplexed', 'how', 'do', 'movie', 'hard', 'Deschanel', 'very', 'little.Shymalayan', 'films', 'do', 'not', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'display', 'horror', 'situations', 'earlier', 'films', 'were', 'famous', 'having', 'more', 'IMPLIED', 'horror', 'shown', 'horror', 'reason', 'films', 'have', 'leaned', 'heavily', 'ACTORS', 'imply', 'correct', 'tone', 'film', 'show', 'EFFECTS', 'horror', 'acting', 'skills', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'examples', 'when', 'acting', 'script', 'flat', 'Shamalayan', 'film', 'nothing', 'else', 'run', 'film', 'movie', 'sadly', 'collapses.Ultimately', 'study', 'seeing', 'great', 'director', 'crash', 'burn', 'film', 'Seeing', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'directed', 'Shyamalan', 'buck', 'there', 'always', 'complete', 'creative', 'control', 'movies', 'sadly', 'when', 'crash', 'burn', 'as', 'bad', 'one', 'blame.This', 'movie', 'down', 'there', 'Boogeyman', 'one', 'worst', 'horror/sci', 'fi', 'films', 'last', '5', 'years', 'strongly', 'hope', 'Shamalayan', 'can', 'come', 'back', 'take', 'break', 'couple', 'years', 'get', 'bearings', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'sadly', 'epic', 'failure.Sorry', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD.I', 'rented', 'FREE', 'still', 'dont', 'want', 'ever', 'see', 'again.Just', 'go', 'watch', 'Signs', 'havent', 'seen', 'same', 'type', 'film', 'done', '20', 'times', 'better']",N/A

Soon after this a mysterious breeze hits New York, specifically Central Park where people start to kill themselves (one lady even jabs a pen into her neck) and from then on it seems clear that the planet is quite unhappy with how people have been and are currently treating it so why not create something that causes us to lose our will to live.Elliot and his somewhat jaded wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel, ""(500) Days of Summer"") along with a few others try to escape to safety and stay alive despite all this chaos. They go through the nearby countryside where Elliot keeps trying to find ways to simply explain what is happening to the planet and why people are doing what they're doing. The pro-earth propaganda just is sickening, the story is just plain silly, no scares, not good acting by anyone, people just run off and do their own thing which is usually the dumbest thing. Like when Elliot's friend Julian (John Leguizamo, ""Moulin Rouge"") goes into the city to get his loved ones despite knowing he has no chance to make it, once a hole is punctured in the roof of the car, the bad air gets in and soon after he thankfully off's himself.Watching this load of you know what from director M.

Written horribly. Acted stupefyingly. Directed abysmally. Take any cinematic term and pair it with a pejorative adjective or adverb and you'll be able to capture the putrescent essence of this &#34;film&#34; much more effectively than the director himself was able to do as he was presumably trying to steer this ramshackle, listing, sinking tugboat into some sort of  safe harbor. News-flash: the ship didn't even remotely make it to port. I can't believe I sat through this bilge without hanging myself by my own neck from the ceiling fan. My kingdom for a rope!Look, I very much enjoyed 'The Sixth Sense,' was reasonably entertained by 'Signs,' and found 'The Village' tolerable. The fact that a big-shot director can plummet so precipitously from the lofty peak of such a promising start is far more disturbing and &#34;scary&#34; than anything you'll see in MNS's recent offerings, and especially in 'The Happening.' Even the title reeks of abject creative collapse. I understand that he tried to pass this off as some sort of ironic &#34;B-movie&#34; homage when the word spread of its awfulness (and word spread as quickly as suicide-vapors emanating from perturbed inner-city trees). The only irony is that almost any B-movie from the 1950s would look like a Matisse painting compared to this exercise in flatulence.What happened to this man? Too much fame and money too quickly? A lobotomy procedure we never heard about? Did Satan promise him immortality at an eternal Vegas strip-club (with an open bar) in exchange for every last iota of talent left in his body? If so, then please make a movie about *that* story, dude. It would be light years more interesting than Mark Walhberg mincing through a performance more painful than the death of your most beloved pet and the harrowing indecency of being fooled into watching Zooey Bechamel try to &#34;act&#34; in anything at all.Better yet, with the trajectory of ruin that Hollywood's Rocketship of Rotten is currently traveling and the box-office bombs falling one atop the other like dominoes, could someone start campaigning for a few cinematic standards before even greenlighting offal like this in the future? Huh? Moviegoers deserve better -- give some newcomers with actual talent, fresh ideas THAT HAVE A HINT OF VERISIMILITUDE and burning enthusiasm a chance. MNS has long overstayed his welcome. Make him test-drive his &#34;movies&#34; on You Tube before inviting him back to the rodeo.Is our once-admirable cinematic/entertainment culture truly beyond wide-scale redemption? Don't answer that. I don't think I want to know the truth. I watched this on my night off, because I have always kept giving MNS amother chance despite so much evidence of a staggering decline, and I was genuinely insulted to find that 'The Happening' wasn't even &#34;so bad it's good&#34; bad.

1183870,A3GRN6J64F2C3X,B001DZOC3W,"Joseph P. Menta, Jr.","[4, 6]","I guess I can see why many film enthusiasts don't like ""The Happening"" very much.  After the rich visuals and truly ""out there"" stories of ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", and, of course ""The Sixth Sense"", this one feels a little stark and one-note, both thematically and visually.  In the former category, this is simply a story of nature rebelling against man.  Yes, there's some mystery (how far exactly will nature go?), but basically it's a movie about characters running through fields trying to escape toxin-laden winds.  On the latter front, the visuals offer no moody shadows, no scary night scenes, nothing but bright sunlight.  That's a brave and certainly credible choice in some ways (Stanley Kubrick, for example, deliberately filmed ""The Shining"" as a brightly lit movie to avoid the visual cliches of most onscreen horror), but unless other aspects of your story are rich and complex, sunshine and bright lighting probably aren't the most interesting ways to go in the suspense/horror genre.But having said all that, the movie is still sufficiently creepy and scary, and we care enough about the characters (especially the neurotic but endearing couple played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) to stay emotionally invested in the proceedings.  It's also interesting to see Mr. Shyamalan offer up a hard R-rated film, though one can argue that his previous PG-13 limitations forced him to shock us more creatively and subtly.In the end, if you like movies like ""The Birds"", ""The Mist"", the thousand or so entries in the ""zombies vs. mankind"" genre, or any number of other movies about a sudden scary phenomenon confronting humanity, with people having to pool together to address the crisis or just survive, you'll probably find ""The Happening"" compelling and entertaining enough. By my own rankings, it isn't nearly as ""must see"" as the Shyamalan movies mentioned at the outset, but a little more satisfying than the director's more recent efforts like ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"" (though those have their merits, too).

Night Shyamalan he directed the 6th Sense which I like Unbreakable which I enjoy but he also directed Signs which if you see that movie you'll be like no wonder Mel Gibson's psycho now. Most recently he directed The Last Air Bender so his recent track record hasn't been good at all. Happening starring Mark Wahlberg as Elliot Moore & Mark this was your worst performance you have ever given. Zooey Deschanel as Alma Moore she was boring. John Leguizamo as Julian he has a daughter Jess played by Ashlyn Sanchez they give better perfomances even these 2 teenage actor that I've never heard of give better perfomances. Then you have Betty Buckly as Mrs. Jones. The movie starts off decent in Centeral Park & people are killing themselves. But boy oh boy does the idea of a neat interesting plot become a big cluster fv**  Elliot Moore is a High School Science teacher & his friend Julian works as a Math teacher they're told that some terrorist attack has happened & they need to evacate until it stops so Elliot his wife Alma, Julian & his daughter Jess are taking a train to get far away from the North East but the train has stopped cause it lost communication wtf? They leave these poeple stranded Julian decides to go to Princton NJ to find his wife. Now if you like John Leguizamo he dies. You like Mark Wahlberg he gives the worst performance. So there's a scene with this Soldier & he tells them that everybody offed thereselves at the base he's told that there are more people dead down the road his reaction is ""Oh cheese & crackers."" WTF? Then we have these 2 teen boys get there heads blown off with a shot gun. Then they go to this old ladies house Mrs. Jones definitly not how Billy Paul described her. Ok this lady is I don't care about her character at the dinner table that little girl Jess is going to get a biscuit & that b!**h  smacks her hand. Then the best part & this is on you tube type The Happening what no. This Lady is really mad at Marky Mark she says. ""You plan on stealing from me."" Marky Mark "" No mam I'm not."" Mrs.Jones: ""Plan on murdering me in my sleep."" Marky Mark. ""What NOOOO."" Oh & I was happy when Mrs. Jones died I don't care about her or pretty much anybody in the movie so why should. Ok the ending is decent Elliot & Alma adopt Jess & Alma is pregnet. But it shows the same thing ""Happening."" LOL in Europe. Mark Wahlberg this is the worst performance I've ever seen you give I mean I liked him in RM & Shooter. Zooey Daschanel bleh. Betty Buckly I don't care about John Leguizamo was decent Ashlyn Sanchez was decent too. People talk $#!* about The Blair Witch Project which was made on a shoestring budget & actors that at least came off as real people they weren't great but at least Heather Danahue, Josh Leonard & Michael Williams came off as real people. The Happening has a $48 million budget & just is pathetic & acting should be natural & Marky Mark gives a bad performance. Interesting idea terrible execution 1st they think it's terrorists then it's plants & trees communicate with each other then they communicate with insects then it's the air. People whined over The Expendables about Oh the plot wasn't deep at least it was straight forward.

OK, here goes.First the negative: ""The Happening"" just is not happening as a successful film. Did M. Night really think a movie with the wind blowing trees and grasses would be frightening? Or that the addition of music as a character with the wind would be ominous enough? Perhaps it is with Mark Wahlberg that he expected the movie to be scary. After all, Wahlberg is noted for his intense acting and those serious facial contortions. One scene shows a side view of his face all screwed up. All I could think was how deeply creased his forehead would one day be! A scary movie should not allow me to think that!However, one of the few really scary parts occurred when the greenhouse guy was in the scene. First, he tells us that plants respond to human voices (true, long-time studies have confirmed this) and that they can respond negatively as well--deep foreshadowing! After the close-up of his misaligned facial features, I fully expected this dude to be hit with neurotoxins and go beserk. Didn't happen. Red herring!Another really scary part involved the old woman living in isolation, who revealed herself to be beserk without help of neurotoxins. Maybe that was M Night's point: Nature needs to help along the deletion of unsavory human beings, especially including Average Joe (the construction site jumpers--it is no telling what they have done to the plant world!!), but also the truly insane (the old woman who wisely chose to live in the safety of isolation).I'm going to leave the last three months alone. I could tear into the problems there, too.Now the positive: Some of these comments are just the reverse of my negative ones. For example, the addition of Wahlberg in the film was a plus because of his intensity. He pretty much makes the whole plant thing  believable--well, almost believable. I was even convinced his and Alma's love stopped the neurotoxins. Actually, because of the mystery entwined throughout the story, there is no reason not to think their love stopped the toxins. In other scenes the galloping fear of toxins seemingly increased the plant rampage.Overcast skies, wind and music, discordance between words and actions, palpable fear, Wahlberg's panic attack, the Hitchcock-like house and old woman--all lent themselves to an increasing sense of unease to dis-ease. The film does work in some ways.I leave further arguments to others.",3,Is it happening?,1223683200,"10 11, 2008",2008,2446,"['OK', 'Umm', 'Uh', 'OK', 'just', 'stall', 'words', 'keep', 'getting', 'started', 'OK', 'here', 'negative', 'Happening', 'just', 'not', 'happening', 'successful', 'film', 'Did', 'M.', 'Night', 'really', 'think', 'movie', 'wind', 'blowing', 'trees', 'grasses', 'would', 'be', 'frightening', 'addition', 'music', 'character', 'wind', 'would', 'be', 'ominous', 'enough', 'Perhaps', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'expected', 'movie', 'be', 'scary', 'Wahlberg', 'noted', 'intense', 'acting', 'serious', 'facial', 'contortions', 'One', 'scene', 'side', 'view', 'face', 'screwed', 'up', 'could', 'think', 'was', 'how', 'deeply', 'creased', 'forehead', 'would', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'scary', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'allow', 'think', 'However', 'one', 'few', 'really', 'scary', 'parts', 'occurred', 'when', 'greenhouse', 'guy', 'was', 'scene', 'First', 'plants', 'respond', 'human', 'voices', 'true', 'long-time', 'studies', 'have', 'confirmed', 'can', 'respond', 'negatively', 'as', 'well', 'deep', 'foreshadowing', 'close-up', 'misaligned', 'facial', 'features', 'fully', 'expected', 'dude', 'be', 'hit', 'neurotoxins', 'go', 'beserk', 'Did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'Red', 'herring', 'really', 'scary', 'part', 'involved', 'old', 'woman', 'living', 'isolation', 'who', 'revealed', 'be', 'beserk', 'help', 'neurotoxins', 'Maybe', 'was', 'M', 'Night', 'point', 'Nature', 'help', 'deletion', 'unsavory', 'human', 'beings', 'especially', 'including', 'Average', 'Joe', 'construction', 'site', 'jumpers', 'telling', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'plant', 'world', 'also', 'truly', 'insane', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'wisely', 'chose', 'live', 'safety', 'isolation', ""'m"", 'going', 'leave', 'last', 'three', 'months', 'alone', 'could', 'tear', 'problems', 'there', 'too.Now', 'positive', 'comments', 'are', 'just', 'reverse', 'negative', 'ones', 'example', 'addition', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'was', 'plus', 'intensity', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'plant', 'thing', 'believable', 'well', 'almost', 'believable', 'was', 'even', 'convinced', 'Alma', 'love', 'stopped', 'neurotoxins', 'Actually', 'mystery', 'entwined', 'story', 'reason', 'not', 'think', 'love', 'stopped', 'toxins', 'other', 'scenes', 'galloping', 'fear', 'toxins', 'seemingly', 'increased', 'plant', 'rampage.Overcast', 'skies', 'wind', 'music', 'discordance', 'words', 'actions', 'palpable', 'fear', 'Wahlberg', 'panic', 'attack', 'Hitchcock-like', 'house', 'old', 'woman', 'lent', 'increasing', 'sense', 'unease', 'dis-ease', 'film', 'work', 'ways.I', 'leave', 'further', 'arguments', 'others']",N/A
1183874,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B001DZOC3W,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[1, 2]","You know, I used to think that writer/director M. Night Shymalan was actually a really talented filmmaker; one who knew how to make movies that audiences the world over could enjoy. I mean this was the man that chilled audiences with his breakthrough hit ""The Sixth Sense"", showed us a burgeoning hero coming to grips with who and what he was becoming in ""Unbreakable"", and then explored faith and paranoia in ""Signs"". As good as those movies were, with ""The Sixth Sense"" being the best of them, after only three movies something began to go wrong and we were suddenly given some rather underwhelming films, such as ""The Village"" or the extremely dull and quirky ""Lady in the Water"". Even with M. Night's apparent fall from Hollywood grace due to his previous two efforts, his latest movie looked as if it might actually have what it takes to stand tall amongst the earlier work in his career. However, after watching the recently released ""The Happening"" I have now come to the realization that M. Night Shymalan is officially overrated and that he no longer understands what it takes to make a truly great movie.""The Happening"" follows a science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg), as he tries to grasp what is causing some extremely bizarre events that have begun to plague the people around him. As more and more people begin acting strangely, Elliot senses that perhaps an unseen force is causing humans to do bizarre and violent things to themselves. The further Elliot tries to understand what is happening around him, the more shocking the truth becomes as it appears that humanity may be under attack from the very plants that surround us everywhere.For some reason I really did want to see this movie when I first saw the trailer. Regardless, of the less-than-stellar results his last two films yielded, I thought that perhaps M. Night Shymalan had once more discovered what he seemed to have forgotten that made his early movies favorites among moviegoers. However, after only getting 20 minutes into ""The Happening"" it was painfully clear that I was wrong, and that M. Night had once again delivered a steaming pile of crap to audiences. Now, I did go ahead and finish this movie, but I couldn't hardly wait for the 90 minute long running time to come to a close so that I could swiftly eject this movie from my player, and soon begin purging the memory of this movie from my mind; sadly I have yet to succeed in doing this completely.The plot for this movie is such a ludicrous concept, and obviously done in an attempt to cash in on the whole ""Go Green"" craze that seems to be sweeping the nation. I believe even the most ardent ""Green"" supporter will laugh at the sheer stupidity of the notion that perhaps the plant-life of Earth is attempting to kill humanity in response to all the damage we've done to the environment over the years. As if the basic plot for this movie wasn't bad enough, the dialogue was sub-par throughout the entire movie. I don't know what M. Night was thinking when writing this movie, but he seems to have forgotten how to write clever, intriguing, and realistic dialogue for his characters to recite. In place of well-written dialogue we find surprisingly pointless conversations and even a few areas where characters are given a line to say that feels completely out of place given everything they've been experiencing over the course of the film. Essentially, nothing in the story for ""The Happening"" worked for me, and if the studio felt that this would be a nice attempt to cash in on the ""Go Green"" agenda, they were sorely mistaken as this movie made only a paltry amount of money during its mercifully brief stint at the box office.To top off this movie's horrible excuse for a story, ""The Happening"" also managed to have really talented actors give some of the worst performances of their careers. The movie's lead, Mark Wahlberg (""The Departed""), is an actor who I would normally classify as extremely talented and one of my favorite actor's in the business today; however, this movie really causes one to question what Mark was thinking in signing on for such an obvious flop. For an actor that generally chooses really good roles in typically great movies, this seems like a giant blunder on his part; especially when his overall performance is very uneven and generally uninspired, complete with some poor line readings and unconvincing acting in places. Supporting Mark we have actress Zooey Deschanel (""Failure to Launch"") who does an average job as Elliot's distant wife, although a couple of times her performance seemed to falter, but this could have been caused by the rather dim-witted lines of dialogue her character was given to speak. Rounding out the primary supporting cast we have comedian and actor John Leguizamo (""Righteous Kill""). John is typically a fairly solid character actor, but here I think he was trying too hard to create a quirky character to the point that he ends up becoming more annoying than unique. I must point out that even though the cast had some rough spots in their performances, I believe a lot of the blame must rest with M. Night Shymalan for not giving his actors something worthy of their talents to work with.At one time writer/director M. Night Shymalan was being heralded as one of the most original filmmakers to hit Hollywood in years, thanks in no small part to the blockbuster successes of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs""; and yet over the course of his career, only half of the movies he has made have actually been worth watching. ""The Happening"" continues the streak of cinematic garbage that M. Night has dumped upon unsuspecting moviegoers hoping for some sort of surprising movie experience, the likes of which we haven't seen since ""The Sixth Sense"". Perhaps with three well-below average movies in a row both studios and audiences will cease to give this overrated hack a chance, at least until he can come up with a story worthy of our attention once again.For those of you that may have noticed, ""The Happening"" is M. Night Shymalan's first rated R movie, a fact that the studio is heavily touting in their advertising for the recent DVD release; but I honestly can't say that I saw anything in this movie that should have garnered such a rating. Although, I do find it somewhat humorous that the only aspect of this movie the studio's marketing department can choose to focus on is its rating. When something like this occurs it's a pretty clear indication that the movie won't be worth your time or money.""The Happening"" is rated R for violence and brief language.",1,Who Cares What's

I enjoyed it once, but would probably not watch it a second time.It begins in Central Park, Manhattan, New York, where 2 girls are on a park bench reading and talking.  A strange breeze comes out of nowhere, people are frozen still in their tracks.  One of the girls on the bench pulls her hairpin out of her head and stabs herself in the neck.  Yuk.Next scene is 3 blocks from the park on a construction site.  People start jumping from the tops of buildings.  Splat.  Splat.  Splat.  Another one bites the dust, like the song goes.Next, we go to Philadelphia, where Mark Whalberg/Elliot is a school teacher.  He is discussing what might make people kill themselves in NYC, asking the teens for their possible theories.  The news media is talking about possible terrorist activities in releasing airborn toxins around the park.  NYC has just been evacuated and schools are now closing in Philadelphia.  The teachers at Elliot's school are told to send the students home.  School is being closed.  Now the news media is saying this is a neurotoxin that makes you kill yourself.  Elliot and his wife/Emma pack to take the train out of Philadelphia out to the country.  They are going with a friend and his 8-year old daughter Jess.  The friend's wife/Yvette hops a bus to Princeton, NJ (I think she waited too long to get the train or something). The same thing begins to happen in a park in Philadelphia.  Everybody on the train begins to talk about what's happening as the train chugs along out into the country.  Finally, the train stops in a little no-name town deep in the PA suburbs and they make evrybody get off.  It seems the train crew has lost contact with everyone, so they just stopped.  The radio is now saying it is happening up and down the whole Northeast.  The people from the train start panicking and Jess' dad gets a ride with some people to go to Princeton to look for Yvette, and sends Jess with Elliott and Emma.  As dad and the car arrive in Princeton, they see dead people everywhere.  Meanwhile, Elliott, Emma and Jess take off in another direction with some other people.  There seems to be something in the air and when the wind blows, it blows this ""something"" on you.  Then you flip out and kill yourself, robotic-like. Nature's way of getting even, or protecting itself against humans?It's scary and suspenseful.  I enjoyed watching it once, but not more than once.  I had to look away a couple of times when people were doing themselves in, but it wasn't too bad.  I do NOT recommend this for children.  Could give them nasty nightmares.The movie lasted about 90 minutes.  I enjoy Whalberg in his roles.

I""m a sucker for Shyamalan's work and I don't expect it to flow in a logical, plot-driven way. Some of his movies seem more like dreams that continue to evolve, sometimes to their darkest levels, and are played out in ""real"" life, but with a certain poetic quality.This movie is along those lines. Is it believable? Up to a point. People are worried about the environment but could an event, so self-limiting, actually happen? To fall under the director's spell, I think viewers need to suspend their sense of reality and accept the mystery and danger of life.In any case, I did enjoy this movie and found it evocative. 107 other people here on Amazon did not. So I dutifully note that I'm in the minority and may not be able to view Shyamalan's movies with objectivity. He speaks to those who believe that mysterious and even unseen forces could be at work in the world.

Night Shyamalan.The Sixth SenseandUnbreakableare very good movies but after that his films are hugely flawed and contain only brief moments of effective suspense.  Shyamalan really had a unique knack for directing fear in his actors at his most inspired moments, and in addition to that the writing of his first two films was also a plus.  He was a very good filmmaker for a spell.  The Happening is so much more tragic than some people have warned, but here at Amazon it seems I finally find myself agreeing with many other reviewers who I'd normally suggest are exaggerating.  One says ""so bad it's shocking"" and another calls the film ""the crappening"".  Both are spot on.Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school science teacher whose marriage to his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) is seemingly in some jeopardy.  His friend Julian (John Leguizamo) is aware that Alma may have been unfaithful.  Along with Julian's daughter, this group searches for safety in a world that has just been hit by a massive suicide epidemic that is never convincingly explained and never turns out to be an engaging occurrence to begin with.  I actually like all three actors in some roles but they are either left with so little direction that they don't know what to do or how to react to Shyamalan's apocalypse, or they are smiling behind thin performances because they realize they are in a bombastic failure of a film.  I lean toward the latter because by the film's conclusion Deschanel and Wahlberg really seem like they are in a comedy.The Happening is bad because it wants to be taken so seriously.  It has moments that should be horrifying but instead elicited several moments of laughter from this viewer.  For those who have seen the film I will just say that the scene that really sticks out for me involves a suicide at the zoo.  There are also moments of incredibly unlikely behavior; to the point where I slapped my own forehead.  I mean come on, if a lady is talking to her daughter who is vulnerable to this unknown suicide causing agent, I hardly think she would put the girl on speaker so a dozen other people can hear her die.  It's a shame because The Happening should've been good.  On the surface it is a decent story with a good cast.  Not to mention all of the pieces theoretically enhance Shyamalan's talents.  I was hoping this would take films likeLady in the WaterandThe Villageand promptly decrease their significance in the mainstream eye, but instead The Happening only serves to support Shyamalan's very obvious decline.",1,Shymalan's Second Chances are Running Out,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",2008,2611,"['Happening', 'indefensible', 'unintentional', 'laugh-fest', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan.The', 'Sixth', 'SenseandUnbreakableare', 'very', 'good', 'movies', 'films', 'are', 'hugely', 'flawed', 'contain', 'only', 'brief', 'moments', 'effective', 'suspense', 'Shyamalan', 'really', 'had', 'unique', 'knack', 'directing', 'fear', 'actors', 'most', 'inspired', 'moments', 'addition', 'writing', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'was', 'also', 'plus', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'spell', 'Happening', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'tragic', 'people', 'have', 'warned', 'here', 'Amazon', 'finally', 'find', 'agreeing', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', ""'d"", 'normally', 'suggest', 'are', 'exaggerating', 'One', 'so', 'bad', 'shocking', 'film', 'crappening', 'are', 'spot', 'on.Elliot', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'marriage', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'seemingly', 'jeopardy', 'friend', 'Julian', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'aware', 'Alma', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'unfaithful', 'Julian', 'daughter', 'group', 'safety', 'world', 'just', 'been', 'hit', 'massive', 'suicide', 'epidemic', 'never', 'convincingly', 'explained', 'never', 'out', 'be', 'engaging', 'occurrence', 'begin', 'actually', 'three', 'actors', 'roles', 'are', 'left', 'so', 'little', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'how', 'react', 'Shyamalan', 'apocalypse', 'are', 'smiling', 'thin', 'performances', 'realize', 'are', 'bombastic', 'failure', 'film', 'lean', 'latter', 'film', 'conclusion', 'Deschanel', 'Wahlberg', 'really', 'seem', 'are', 'comedy.The', 'Happening', 'bad', 'be', 'taken', 'so', 'seriously', 'moments', 'should', 'be', 'horrifying', 'instead', 'elicited', 'several', 'moments', 'laughter', 'viewer', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'will', 'just', 'say', 'scene', 'really', 'out', 'suicide', 'zoo', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'incredibly', 'unlikely', 'behavior', 'point', 'where', 'slapped', 'own', 'forehead', 'mean', 'come', 'lady', 'talking', 'daughter', 'who', 'vulnerable', 'unknown', 'suicide', 'causing', 'agent', 'hardly', 'think', 'would', 'put', 'girl', 'speaker', 'so', 'dozen', 'other', 'people', 'can', 'hear', 'die', 'shame', 'Happening', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'good', 'surface', 'decent', 'story', 'good', 'cast', 'Not', 'mention', 'pieces', 'theoretically', 'enhance', 'Shyamalan', 'talents', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'take', 'films', 'likeLady', 'WaterandThe', 'Villageand', 'promptly', 'decrease', 'significance', 'mainstream', 'eye', 'instead', 'Happening', 'only', 'support', 'Shyamalan', 'very', 'obvious', 'decline']",N/A

1183884,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B001DZOC3W,Kevin Killian,"[0, 1]","From the reviews I knew the movie was going to be a letdown, but we had fun watching it and got suckered in by the spooky, melancholy sound of the wind stirring the grass and the leaves at the top of the incredibly tall trees.  From that standpoint the film's technical credits get high marks.  I even liked James Newton Howard's score, but I have a weakness for overemphatic film music--at least I thought that Howard understood the plot of the film, possibly better than MNS himself.TIRAMISU SPOILER AHEAD!The movie made us examine our own lives as Plato urges us to do.  We walked a mile in the other man's moccasins thinking that if a rare virus sprung up on the wind and made us try to kill ourselves, how would we do it?  It's not as easy as it sounds!  Sure, you could slide a hatpin out of your long hair and stab yourself in the throat with it, but most of us don't have that sort of hair ornament.  You saw what happened when Philadelphia comes to a standstill and an armed cop falls to the ground, his pistol clattering on the cobblestones, and a woman picks it up, then the gun falls again, well, that gun gets a lot of use, it's because people are literally starving for ways to kill themselves.  First off, I decided, I would smoke a carton of cigarettes and enjoy a pitcher of margaritas...  then see what happened.  Maybe a heroin overdose?  In the movie we marvelled how the characters managed to off themselves using just the tools at hand, like McGyvers in revsrse--I never would have thought of lying down on the lawn and letting a mower tear me to shreds....  though jumping out of a building is a natural.  Mark Wahlberg, John Leguizamo, Zooey Deschanel were all uniformly terrible, and Betty Buckley brought back memories of Carrie, where she played the girls' understanding gym teacher...  does she ever survive till the end credits in any of her movies?Most of all I thought M. Night misplayed Zooey Deschanel's secret.  We knew she was harboring a guilty secret, but why did it have to be something as banal as sharing a tiramisu dessert with ""Joey""?

Unfortunately, it seems that this filmmaker is on a downward spiral with his last three.  When I saw the first preview for this movie, I thought that maybe, just maybe M. Night was back with vengeance.  I did not see this movie in the theater, and I didn't really read that many detailed reviews of it because I had decided to give it a fair shake as a rental.The movie starts out by creating a very creepy feeling as the viewer is just thrown into the situation as people seem to suddenly become suicidal for no apparent reason.  The bodies falling from the roof was a disturbing image.  Now the movie is ready to take off as we try to figure out what is causing this bizarre behavior.  Unfortunately, just a few minutes into the movie and I'm getting this sinking feeling that this is not going to end well.  Some of the dialogue in this movie is actually quite hilarious, although I'm not quite sure that's what the filmmaker had in mind.  I won't spoil this for anyone who does not want to heed the warning to stay away from this movie, and instead decided to give it a shot like I did.  That being said, the ""explanation"" for what is causing the suicides was completely LUDICROUS!!!!!  This really could have been a good movie, but it ends up being nothing but a total waste ot time and energy.

1183886,A1W661TC1P6VQI,B001DZOC3W,"Kevin T. Rodriguez ""The Movie Wizard.com Revi...","[1, 5]","I'm telling you, M. Night Shyamalan can't get a break. The second people found out about this movie I heard every complaint you could throw at this movie. I wonder what the twist ending will be? That guy is making ANOTHER suspense thriller!?! I wonder if he'll finally top ""The Sixth Sense?"" On and on people complain before they've even SEEN THE STINKING MOVIE!!! Guys, just chill. Buy a popcorn, and watch ""The Happening"" without any expectations or premonitions. You just might be surprised. ""The Happening"" opens with Mark Wahlberg quizzing his class about the disappearance of millions of honey bees. This is an important topic of course because the Earth needs honey bees to survive. Chances are if you are into reading about the planet, you'll have stumbled upon this very real problem.Shortly after that though it's reported that groups of people are acting strange. First they start talking gibberish. Then they walk backwards. To cap it all off they kill themselves. Sometimes in very violent and bloody fashion (which is likely the reason behind Shyamalan's first R rating). Can this event be explained? Maybe. Wahlberg's character has a theory that the plants are releasing chemicals to the wind, and that the wind is causing the chemicals to effect everything else. Is this a credible theory? Maybe not. Certainly most of the characters don't agree. I'm not even sure if I agree. Another person suggests that this event could just be one of natures unexplained events. And there is the brilliance of this film. Instead of giving the audience a direct answer, Shyamalan simply shows us a terrible event and lets us decide for ourselves what it means.Is the event a warning? Is there any logic behind it? A freak accident? Or is it just something that happened one day? The answer may be in the question, the title, or none of the above. ""The Happening"" seems more interested in asking questions then it does giving answers to odd questions. A rarity from Shyamalan to be sure, but the loss of honey bees hits close to home, and I get the feeling Shyamalan made this film as a way to soul search. This movie strikes me as being concerned about the environment, and the event that happens just can't be logically explained or proven. We can have our suspicions, but ultimately they are just that. This movie breaks many of the rules Shyamalan has set up in his past films, and for that he gets an A.That said, is this Shyamalan's best movie? No. Is it ONE of his best?! Well, considering the man has made a mere six films, and if I were to select the top three, then no, this is not one of them. What this movie is is scary. And suspenseful. And if nothing else, it's got some of the most eerie images he's filmed in years. And if that isn't worth a recommendation then I must seriously do a soul search and discover what is.Rating: *** stars",3,It's Happening (On a small scale),1215129600,"07 4, 2008",2008,2852,"[""'m"", 'telling', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'break', 'second', 'people', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'heard', 'complaint', 'could', 'throw', 'movie', 'wonder', 'what', 'twist', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'guy', 'making', 'ANOTHER', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'wonder', ""'ll"", 'finally', 'top', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'people', 'complain', ""'ve"", 'even', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'STINKING', 'MOVIE', 'Guys', 'just', 'chill', 'Buy', 'popcorn', 'watch', 'Happening', 'expectations', 'premonitions', 'just', 'might', 'be', 'surprised', 'Happening', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'quizzing', 'class', 'disappearance', 'millions', 'honey', 'bees', 'important', 'topic', 'course', 'Earth', 'honey', 'bees', 'survive', 'Chances', 'are', 'are', 'reading', 'planet', ""'ll"", 'have', 'stumbled', 'very', 'real', 'problem.Shortly', 'reported', 'groups', 'people', 'are', 'acting', 'strange', 'First', 'start', 'talking', 'gibberish', 'Then', 'walk', 'backwards', 'cap', 'kill', 'Sometimes', 'very', 'violent', 'bloody', 'fashion', 'likely', 'reason', 'Shyamalan', 'first', 'R', 'rating', 'Can', 'event', 'be', 'explained', 'Maybe', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'theory', 'plants', 'are', 'releasing', 'chemicals', 'wind', 'wind', 'causing', 'chemicals', 'effect', 'everything', 'else', 'credible', 'theory', 'Maybe', 'not', 'Certainly', 'most', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'agree', 'person', 'event', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'natures', 'unexplained', 'events', 'brilliance', 'film', 'Instead', 'giving', 'audience', 'direct', 'answer', 'Shyamalan', 'simply', 'terrible', 'event', 'decide', 'what', 'means.Is', 'event', 'warning', 'there', 'logic', 'freak', 'accident', 'just', 'something', 'happened', 'one', 'day', 'answer', 'may', 'be', 'question', 'title', 'none', 'above', 'Happening', 'more', 'interested', 'asking', 'questions', 'then', 'giving', 'answers', 'odd', 'questions', 'rarity', 'Shyamalan', 'be', 'sure', 'loss', 'honey', 'bees', 'hits', 'close', 'home', 'get', 'feeling', 'Shyamalan', 'made', 'film', 'way', 'soul', 'search', 'movie', 'being', 'concerned', 'environment', 'event', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'logically', 'explained', 'proven', 'can', 'have', 'suspicions', 'ultimately', 'are', 'just', 'that', 'movie', 'many', 'rules', 'Shyamalan', 'set', 'up', 'past', 'films', 'A.That', 'said', 'Shyamalan', 'best', 'movie', 'ONE', 'best', 'Well', 'considering', 'man', 'made', 'mere', 'six', 'films', 'were', 'select', 'top', 'three', 'then', 'not', 'one', 'What', 'movie', 'scary', 'suspenseful', 'nothing', 'else', 'got', 'most', 'eerie', 'images', 'filmed', 'years', ""n't"", 'worth', 'recommendation', 'then', 'must', 'seriously', 'do', 'soul', 'search', 'discover', 'what', 'is.Rating', '***', 'stars']",N/A

1183899,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B001DZOC3W,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 6]","""The Happening"" didn't.  M. Night Shyamalan's film rested on a strange premise.  While I liked the environmental message echoed in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" that man must be a partner with nature on the planet, the idea that a substance could abrogate free will and drive masses to suicide seemed preposterous.  If the plants had decided to go on an oxygen strike and people started suffocating, that might have made more sense.  Here we have wind blowing on the grass or the wind in a tree which is supposed to be a sinister event.  Shyamalan's image of people jumping from buildings was unique as was the car crash.  However, these moments could not salvage a weak premise.The shaky premise was also complicated by the lack of acting performance.  This has to be a failure of Shyamalan as a director to elicit good work from most of his actors.  I did like two performances in the film.  Betty Buckley was the coach inCarriein her first film back in 1976 & played a country singer inTender Mercies.  She won a Tony award for ""Cats.""  As Mrs. Jones, she creates one of the creepiest characters I've seen in a long time, a woman who lives in the middle of nowhere, cut off from contact with the outside world with no telephone, television, radio or computer.  When she smashes her head through the glass, it is the crowning moment to a woman who slapped the girl's hand for reaching for a cookie and screamed with paranoia that her guests were trying to steal from her shabby old house.Another good cameo was by soap star Kristen Connolly who played a confused woman reading on a bench.  Her confusion and odd behavior sets the tone for upcoming events.  Child actress Ashlyn Sanchez as Jess did an acceptable job with the little she was asked to do.  Her stoic stare as her father abandons her has to be Shyamalan's choice.  Alan Ruck who was in the great filmTwisteras well as ""Speed"" has a brief cameo as the principal.On the negative side, Colombian-born actor John Leguizamo was in a film I liked,Assault on Precinct 13 (Widescreen Edition).The Groomsmennow joins this film as two for which I did not care.  As the father Julian, I understand his concern over the fate of his wife.  However, his abandonment of his daughter in a stressful uncertain time was inexcusable.  And this was BEFORE he went nuts.  Leguizamo did what he was asked to do; so again the fault in conception is with the director.  Mark Wahlberg's cardboard thin performance as science teacher Elliot Moore may have one wondering if this was the same actor nominated for an Oscar forThe Departed (Widescreen Edition).  In the scene where he's separated from his wife, his level of concern was very low.For me the worst performance of the film, the real raspberry, is Zooey Deschanel as Alma.  This actress had received a Best Actress nomination by the Independent Spirit Awards forAll the Real Girlsand was inThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.  I have no idea what Shyamalan said to her to get such a wide-eyed vacant stare as a woman who thinks she may have destroyed her marriage and faces the lethal health crisis that threatens her life.While the cinematography was good, the story and major performances preclude me wanting to watch it again.

1183904,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B001DZOC3W,magellan,"[4, 6]","First, I should say I'm a big fan of Shyamalan and think The Sixth Sense is one of the best movies ever made by an independent director, or anybody for that matter. I've liked everything I've seen until now, even though he's never come close to equalling The Sixth Sense.Unfortunately, this movie may go down in cinematic history as one of the worst movies of all time. I give it two stars just because the idea of plants attacking humans with some kind of chemical is original. There haven't been very many movies made where plants are the bad guys. Old time sci-fi fans will recall the classic Day of the Trifids, based on the famous John Wyndham novel; Little Shop of Horrors, which was more of a dark comedy; and there was an original mid-60s Outer Limits episode where flowers were zapping  people with clouds of deadly spores (although flowering plants actually have seeds, not spores), not to mention the cult low budget satire, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Those films were, however, memorable, but this one unfortunately is not.I note that there are at this point over 180 one-star reviews, and only about 40 five star-reviews, so I'm not the only one who thought this movie was a turkey, and I admit to being easily entertained when it comes to movies. I've hardly ever given a movie one or two stars, so if I think it's bad, it's probably pretty terrible.The first problem is the more than awkward script, which Wahlberg struggles valiantly with but it's basically hopeless. The relationship between him and Zooey (Deschanel) is never really developed. And although Wahlberg's performance is decent despite the mediocre material, Deschanel seems to spend most of the movie with this deer in the headlights look of stupefaction on her face which just gets tiresome after the first 15 minutes. I don't know his name, but the guy who plays the nerdy horticulturalist was good. Unfortunately, he disappears after a few scenes and isn't used again in the movie, which is too bad. The science behind the whole concept is poorly developed, despite the TV interview with some biologist Ph.D. at the end of the movie, who adds a few more scant details, but that's about it.Unfortunately, the problem with making plants the bad guys is that they're just not that dynamic as villains. The only thing Shyamalan can do to indicate a possibly impending attack is to have a stiff breeze blow at all the people, with everyone running around frantically trying to get indoors and close all the doors and windows. With plants as the bad guys, it's hard to run anywhere since plants are everywhere, and much of the action is just these big groups of hapless survivors traipsing down roads or across fields hoping that the local vegetation doesn't yet have it in for them. This means the movie must rely more on psychological suspense (although the people offing themselves in various grisly ways does provide a macabre sort of action), which Shyamalan is usually very good at, but here it just falls flat.I also have to agree with the other writers here that the scene where the guy walks into the lion's cage at the zoo is just laughably bad even if it might be Shyamalan's allusion to cheesy, 50s ""B"" movie, horror flicks. But that scene was bad even by those standards. ;-(One knowledgeable reviewer here said of Shyamalan's work, ""Shyamalan's movies are getting worse with every release.

There are some parts of this movie that I thought were brilliant and a whole lot that was complete crap. It was so inconsistent. I have seen plenty of films that sucked (ala Twilight, New Spoon) and I have seen plenty that kicked ass. But I have never seen a film that had me laughing one minute and scratching my head the next and completely angry the next.*Spoilers*One reason for this is the senseless violence. There is nothing wrong with violence, even graphic violence, in the proper place and for the proper emotional impact. But this movie totally ham-fists this area into the ground. I don't need to be show the guy getting run over by the lawnmower (fake looking by the way). Show him starting it up, show it coming, but let my imagination do the rest. Lead me up to the cliff, but don't push me over. Let me hear the crunching as he slides under, his screams. A violent act induces all the senses, not just sight. Showing too much, paradoxically, lessens the impact of the violent event. Also, as I said previously about continuity, keep the tone surrounding the violence consistent. I was completely gobsmacked by the scene where the two boys are gunned down at point blank range by the shotgun. Why show me? Utterly inappropriate. Even worse than this, the next scene cuts two these two ladies donning cold-era style gas masks while watching the six-o-clock news. This would have been a really funny scene in any other context, very tongue in cheek and reminiscent of some of the scenes in Signs, but because it was placed right next to the scene of these horrific murders, it completely fails. I am not in the mood to laugh after seeing someone murdered, are you?And more scenes just like these.Other things that sucked: the plot was very thin. The first twenty minutes of dialogue was horrendous; I could feel Shyamalan breathing over my neck delivering every line, followed by ""did you get it? wasn't that clever? Aren't I a clever guy?"" After that the actors seemed to take over and have personalities. I thought Mark Wahlburg and Zooey Deschanel did a great job. I loved every minutes of Deschanel. But back to the sucking. I hated the lame ending. Let me beat you over the head with the message again. And let me not tie anything up or explain anything because nature can't be explained. This ultimately is not a happening, but an end of the world story. Finishing up the movie and then faking like your moving on only to have the world end again (in France, no less) really pisses me off. Also, the cgi in this movie sucked. I hated it and it sticks out like a sore thumb to me.Things I liked: Awesome crazy lady in ramshackle house. This whole sequence was incredible and very well done, right up until the part where they go outside to die together. Loved it. (Didn't love the ridiculous ""gee I guess we missed the plague cause it shut down one minute before we came out, and aren't we luck! Well, let's go back inside and wash the brown Hershey squirts from our trousers and have some cookies and punch."") I thought the part where she slaps the little girls hand was brilliant. In fact, her whole performance was amazing. When she comes in on Mark in the morning and goes nuts, well, that was completely disturbing. I also love the scene where he is talking to the plastic tree. Wonderful!There's more, but I've already spent 25 minutes on this review and that's more than this movie deserves.

1183908,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B001DZOC3W,Marc Cabir Davis,"[0, 1]","""The Happening"", like M. Night Shyamalan's superb ""The Village"", is yet another underrated film from a director, who has consistently produced one spectacular film after the other. I remain in the miniscule minority of people who actually liked ""Lady in the Water"", so perhaps you might want to keep that in mind before reading the rest of this review. Granted, some of his films are better than others. ""Unbreakable"", according to me, was a gigantic mis-step (though beautifully made), while ""Signs"" was a true blue masterpiece, and a classic in the science fiction genre.Which is why ""The Happening"" remains rather elusive and abstract, when held up against his back catalog. Its certainly science-fiction, especially since he predicts a world where our botanical friends overtake the universe and start killing humans, but the real twist is that nature eventually makes man completely self-destructive - not that we aren't already - to the point of voluntary suicide. Many of these suicides appear on-screen in rather graphic fashion - people walking in front of lawn-mowers, car accidents, jumping off buildings, shooting themselves - but they all feel rather plausible given the context.The only problem is with the casting, as Mark Wahlberg is actually a great actor who has had to 'dumb down' for a role such as this. This particular lead role requires the character to look 'continuously perplexed', and Wahlberg does so, but with a hint of irony and sarcasm, which I found rather disconcerting, especially since it seemed ill-fit in a film with rather serious undertones. Perhaps a bone-dead actor like Keanu Reeves would have done better here. I would have gone with Joaquin Phoenix, who stunned us all in ""Signs"" with his acting prowess.The Deschanel girl, who plays the lead female character, is a fine actress otherwise (and a fine musician as well), but her relationship with the main lead feels contrived and forced. Thankfully, this relationship doesn't form the base of the story, so we are pulled into the real issue of environmental mishap and the fury of the plant kingdom. Many critics have said that the lack of a perceptible 'villain' in this film, makes the entire outing seem weak and meandering. Well, that is in part true. Every Shyamalan film has had a true 'bad guy' in some form or the other, but here, the only villain is nature itself, and thats too vague of a concept to present on screen anyway. So we are treated of trees swaying in the breeze, etc, in the hope that we'd find this vision 'menacing' (all set to some dark violin music, of course). At times, this works well, and at others, not so much.""The Happening"" is certainly an acquired taste. Alongwith ""Unbreakable"", its the least 'developed' film in the directors cannon, but its also riveting. I personally feel that its a bit ahead of its' time because its talking about issues that people feel are silly and ridiculous, which is why many of the episodes here seem unintentionally comical. Not so. With the right spirit and with a better understanding of whats happening in the world around us, this is easily a horror flick with the best thats out there.Certain characters, such as John Leguizamo, seem 'added on' with no actual benefit, but their presence makes sense a little down the film. Between the long 'escape sequences' and the truly harrowing scenes where the leads are trapped with a group in a field, wondering if they're going to die next, this is a superb commentary on science-fiction possibilities of the future on our planet. The climax, set in France, was especially interesting because it served as a warning of sorts.While you might have heard absolutely loathsome comments on ""The Happening"", it really is a little classic on its' own terms. The director knew what he was doing. There is a slow, fifteen minute portion of the film where the leads are hiding out in the house of a madwoman (played to perfection by Betty Buckley), but the mood of depression, solitude and impending insanity is captured so well. Watch it just for this long segment - its truly affecting.Four Stars.

1183912,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B001DZOC3W,Mark Turner,"[1, 5]","I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film. Inundated with previews for the film prior to its release, talk of how director M. Night Shyamalan was the next best thing since John Carpenter when it came to horror and a personal recommendation that it was bad made me stop. But when it came in I decided to watch it anyway. I'm glad I did.The film starts in New York, Central Park where people suddenly stop in their tracks. The silence is chilling and what follows even more so as people begin to harm themselves.Move to Philadelphia and a high school where science teacher Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is teaching a group of students about the effects of change in nature. Called out of the office, the teachers are told there has been an apparent airborne attack in New York, possibly by terrorists.As people try and rush out of the big city to avoid a second attack, Moore meets up with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his daughter Jess. Elliott and Alma are in the midst of a relationship crisis that Julian has seen coming, feeling cold towards her since he and Elliott are friends.The airborne pathogen seems to be spreading, hitting more and more major metropolitan areas. As the train taking our travelers reaches a small town outside of the major city, it stops. The reason why? No one is answering their calls up and down the line. This is the last stop.Julian hears that the city his wife was headed for was hit and sets out to find her leaving Jess in the care of Elliott and Alma. What he finds when he reaches his destination is gruesome and startling and its effect on him chilling.Elliott's group carries on and they find a ride. But when they come to a crossroads, cars are coming from all directions, each one with the revelation that further on down the road are people who have been killed. Setting out on foot, it is Elliott who learns the secret of how this is happening, based in part on what one of his fellow travelers said early on.To tell you the cause of this event would be to spoil the surprise. Myself, I knew and it didn't faze me. If you don't want to know, stop reading now.It turns out the cause of the entire even was Mother Nature taking back what is hers, the planet. The airborne pathogen is not man made nor launched as a terrorists attack. It is a compound emitted by the plants that blocks the receptors in the brain that help man from harming himself. Once gone, it also increases their desire for self destruction, thus the mass deaths as a result of suicide.Elliott realizes that the attacks from the plants are focused on only large groups of people. Split into smaller groups, their chances of survival increase. But even then they have to face each other and the fears of who is to blame.Scenes of self destruction and death run rampant and may upset a few viewers. Gore hounds will be disappointed they don't go further. But the fear instilled here of an unseen enemy with no form of defense against it makes for a truly frightening film.Wahlberg is showing that he has the chops to become a great actor. The true gift is when an actor is so immersed in the character that you don't think of him as that celebrity but as that character. Wahlberg is becoming that sort of thespian. The rest of the cast holds up equally well, although Deschanel's character is offered little to do until near the end of the film.This film has taken hits left and right by critics and fans alike. I'll admit that its not the greatest film ever made. But it harkens back to the days of the end of the world films from the 50's that had some unknown creature or fear that caused man to panic and lose track of what was important. It made me think back to those scary films that relied on emotions instead of gore related effects to induce fear.The movie lives in that world, a world where the unknown boogie man, the creature that never raises its head until it attacks, the monster in the closet that is never seen lives. To think that nature itself could decide that it had had enough, that man was the disposable entity in this world that could be removed, is a terrifying thought.Shyamalan may not equal Carpenter in my eyes (I'm a big John Carpenter fan) but he does seem to have a knack for making ones skin crawl. This was a nice change after my disappointment in THE VILLAGE. If you're looking for a truly creepy film for a month when those sorts of films are sought out, this one should foot the bill.",3,NOT NICE TO FOOL MOTHER NATURE,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,4497,"['have', 'admit', 'was', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'film', 'Inundated', 'previews', 'film', 'prior', 'release', 'talk', 'how', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'when', 'came', 'horror', 'personal', 'recommendation', 'was', 'bad', 'made', 'stop', 'when', 'came', 'decided', 'watch', 'anyway', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did.The', 'film', 'starts', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'where', 'people', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'tracks', 'silence', 'chilling', 'what', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'people', 'begin', 'harm', 'themselves.Move', 'Philadelphia', 'high', 'school', 'where', 'science', 'teacher', 'Elliott', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'teaching', 'group', 'students', 'effects', 'change', 'nature', 'Called', 'office', 'teachers', 'are', 'told', 'been', 'apparent', 'airborne', 'attack', 'New', 'York', 'possibly', 'terrorists.As', 'people', 'try', 'rush', 'big', 'city', 'avoid', 'second', 'attack', 'Moore', 'up', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'fellow', 'teacher', 'Julian', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'daughter', 'Jess', 'Elliott', 'Alma', 'are', 'midst', 'relationship', 'crisis', 'Julian', 'seen', 'coming', 'feeling', 'cold', 'Elliott', 'are', 'friends.The', 'airborne', 'pathogen', 'be', 'spreading', 'hitting', 'more', 'more', 'major', 'metropolitan', 'areas', 'train', 'taking', 'travelers', 'small', 'town', 'major', 'city', 'reason', 'why', 'one', 'answering', 'calls', 'line', 'last', 'stop.Julian', 'hears', 'city', 'wife', 'was', 'headed', 'was', 'hit', 'out', 'find', 'leaving', 'Jess', 'care', 'Elliott', 'Alma', 'What', 'when', 'destination', 'gruesome', 'startling', 'effect', 'chilling.Elliott', 'group', 'find', 'ride', 'when', 'come', 'crossroads', 'cars', 'are', 'coming', 'directions', 'one', 'revelation', 'further', 'road', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'killed', 'Setting', 'out', 'foot', 'Elliott', 'who', 'secret', 'how', 'happening', 'based', 'part', 'what', 'one', 'fellow', 'travelers', 'said', 'early', 'on.To', 'tell', 'cause', 'event', 'would', 'be', 'spoil', 'surprise', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'faze', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'know', 'stop', 'reading', 'now.It', 'out', 'cause', 'entire', 'even', 'was', 'Mother', 'Nature', 'taking', 'back', 'what', 'hers', 'planet', 'airborne', 'pathogen', 'not', 'man', 'made', 'launched', 'terrorists', 'attack', 'compound', 'emitted', 'plants', 'receptors', 'brain', 'help', 'man', 'harming', 'Once', 'gone', 'also', 'desire', 'self', 'destruction', 'thus', 'mass', 'deaths', 'result', 'suicide.Elliott', 'attacks', 'plants', 'are', 'focused', 'only', 'large', 'groups', 'people', 'Split', 'smaller', 'groups', 'chances', 'survival', 'increase', 'even', 'then', 'have', 'face', 'other', 'fears', 'who', 'blame.Scenes', 'self', 'destruction', 'death', 'run', 'rampant', 'may', 'upset', 'few', 'viewers', 'Gore', 'hounds', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'further', 'fear', 'instilled', 'here', 'unseen', 'enemy', 'form', 'defense', 'truly', 'frightening', 'film.Wahlberg', 'showing', 'chops', 'become', 'great', 'actor', 'true', 'gift', 'when', 'actor', 'so', 'immersed', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'celebrity', 'character', 'Wahlberg', 'becoming', 'sort', 'thespian', 'rest', 'cast', 'up', 'equally', 'well', 'Deschanel', 'character', 'offered', 'little', 'do', 'end', 'film.This', 'film', 'taken', 'hits', 'left', 'right', 'critics', 'fans', 'alike', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'back', 'days', 'end', 'world', 'films', '50', 'had', 'unknown', 'creature', 'fear', 'caused', 'man', 'panic', 'lose', 'track', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'made', 'think', 'back', 'scary', 'films', 'relied', 'emotions', 'instead', 'gore', 'related', 'effects', 'induce', 'fear.The', 'movie', 'lives', 'world', 'world', 'where', 'unknown', 'boogie', 'man', 'creature', 'never', 'head', 'monster', 'closet', 'never', 'seen', 'lives', 'think', 'nature', 'could', 'decide', 'had', 'had', 'enough', 'man', 'was', 'disposable', 'entity', 'world', 'could', 'be', 'removed', 'terrifying', 'thought.Shyamalan', 'may', 'not', 'equal', 'Carpenter', 'eyes', ""'m"", 'big', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'fan', 'seem', 'have', 'knack', 'making', 'ones', 'skin', 'crawl', 'was', 'nice', 'change', 'disappointment', 'VILLAGE', ""'re"", 'looking', 'truly', 'creepy', 'film', 'month', 'when', 'sorts', 'films', 'are', 'sought', 'out', 'one', 'should', 'foot', 'bill']",N/A
1183913,A1CLHLW9PFKG9Q,B001DZOC3W,MasterAP,"[4, 6]","You cannot go see an M. Night Shyamalan film expecting to see a typical movie. His films have a different flavor to them. When you get used to that idea, when you understand that this isn't a typical Hollywood-told story, you may begin to understand the genius that is Shyamalan.How can I explain The Happening without giving anything away?People begin to kill themselves in New York City. Authorities believe it to be a kind of terrorist attack.You're then introduced to Mark Walhberg's character, Elliot Moore, is a high school science teacher. He's joined by his co-worker/friend Julian (John Leguizamo), Julian's daughter Jess, and Elliot's wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel).The school where Elliot and Julian work decide to release the students when they hear of the attack. The main characters decide to take a train away from Philly. While on the train they hear of the attacks spreading throughout the Northeastern part of the United States.There seems to be no way of escaping this event. Everywhere they go, people are killing themselves. How will anyone survive?I'm a fan of Shyamalan's films. I enjoy his ability to tell a story. All of his films have a message to them and you'd have to be pretty slow not to catch on to what he's trying to say. And I have to tell you, it goes much deeper than ""treat the earth with respect"". People who jump on the bandwagon denouncing this movie as a global warming protest have simply missed the message.Having enjoyed the film, there are a few things that really irked me. Many critics have panned the acting. I go back to what I said earlier, this is not your average film. Don't expect your macho/hero man type talk. But I did have a problem with Mark Wahlberg's character. Maybe it was because he's always around teenagers, but every line sounded like it came from a fifteen year old. It wasn't enough to ruin my experience, it was just a noticiable irk. Second came from Zooey Deschanal. If her character was written like that, than it was just a poor choice. If it was her level of acting...I hope to avoid her films. She was the worst of the small ensemble.**Edit** Having thought about it for a while, I have come to the conclusion that the way they were acting: like children was part of the deeper meaning Shyamalan was trying to bring out. When you watch this movie, watch how childish these two ""adults"" act. And then see how they become real adults...**end edit**John Leguizamo was fantastic, but when is he not? I wanted to see more of him. Maybe he should have been the main character and Walhberg his buddy.This film is rated R and for very good reasons; Shyamalan keeps the camera on the suicide moments a second too long which create a serious feeling of dread. The other reason is because you see two teenage boys murdered with a shotgun. Anytime a minor is killed in a film, the ratings go deeper into R territory.I really enjoyed watching this movie. Along with the sheer dread saturating the run time there were a couple ""Shyamalan"" moments of jump-out-of-your-seats scares.It is rated R so be warned - and, like I said, if you see it, see it with your Shyamalan glasses on (look for the deeper meaning).",4,There Is Purpose Behind the Loony,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,3171,"['can', 'not', 'go', 'see', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'expecting', 'see', 'typical', 'movie', 'films', 'have', 'different', 'flavor', 'When', 'get', 'used', 'idea', 'when', 'understand', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Hollywood-told', 'story', 'may', 'begin', 'understand', 'genius', 'Shyamalan.How', 'can', 'explain', 'Happening', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'People', 'begin', 'kill', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Authorities', 'believe', 'be', 'kind', 'terrorist', 'attack.You', ""'re"", 'then', 'introduced', 'Mark', 'Walhberg', 'character', 'Elliot', 'Moore', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'joined', 'co-worker/friend', 'Julian', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Julian', 'daughter', 'Jess', 'Elliot', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', '.The', 'school', 'where', 'Elliot', 'Julian', 'work', 'decide', 'release', 'students', 'when', 'hear', 'attack', 'main', 'characters', 'decide', 'take', 'train', 'away', 'Philly', 'train', 'hear', 'attacks', 'spreading', 'Northeastern', 'part', 'United', 'States.There', 'be', 'way', 'escaping', 'event', 'Everywhere', 'go', 'people', 'are', 'killing', 'How', 'will', 'anyone', 'survive', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Shyamalan', 'films', 'enjoy', 'ability', 'tell', 'story', 'films', 'have', 'message', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'pretty', 'slow', 'not', 'catch', 'what', 'trying', 'say', 'have', 'tell', 'much', 'deeper', 'treat', 'earth', 'respect', 'People', 'who', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'denouncing', 'movie', 'global', 'warming', 'protest', 'have', 'simply', 'missed', 'message.Having', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'really', 'irked', 'Many', 'critics', 'have', 'panned', 'acting', 'go', 'back', 'what', 'said', 'earlier', 'not', 'average', 'film', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'macho/hero', 'man', 'type', 'talk', 'did', 'have', 'problem', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'character', 'Maybe', 'was', 'always', 'teenagers', 'line', 'sounded', 'came', 'fifteen', 'year', 'old', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'ruin', 'experience', 'was', 'just', 'noticiable', 'irk', 'Second', 'came', 'Zooey', 'Deschanal', 'character', 'was', 'written', 'was', 'just', 'poor', 'choice', 'was', 'level', 'acting', 'hope', 'avoid', 'films', 'was', 'worst', 'small', 'ensemble', 'Having', 'thought', 'while', 'have', 'come', 'conclusion', 'way', 'were', 'acting', 'children', 'was', 'part', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'Shyamalan', 'was', 'trying', 'bring', 'out', 'When', 'watch', 'movie', 'watch', 'how', 'childish', 'two', 'adults', 'act', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'become', 'real', 'adults', '**end', 'edit**John', 'Leguizamo', 'was', 'fantastic', 'when', 'not', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'main', 'character', 'Walhberg', 'buddy.This', 'film', 'rated', 'R', 'very', 'good', 'reasons', 'Shyamalan', 'camera', 'suicide', 'second', 'too', 'long', 'create', 'serious', 'feeling', 'dread', 'other', 'reason', 'see', 'two', 'teenage', 'boys', 'murdered', 'shotgun', 'minor', 'killed', 'film', 'ratings', 'go', 'deeper', 'R', 'territory.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'sheer', 'dread', 'saturating', 'run', 'time', 'were', 'couple', 'Shyamalan', 'moments', 'jump-out-of-your-seats', 'scares.It', 'rated', 'R', 'so', 'be', 'warned', 'said', 'see', 'see', 'Shyamalan', 'look', 'deeper', 'meaning']",N/A
1183914,A2WQC3RIOANQXM,B001DZOC3W,Maxer,"[16, 21]","The Happening is a solid effort from M. Night Shyamalan. It is not his best work, but does cover new ground creatively. I was honestly disappointed that he chose to make an R-rated film. After seeing it, I have to agree that the R rating was necessary to the story.This movie is not meant to be another The Sixth Sense. It is supposed to be a strait forward thriller/horror film. M. Night has never attempted to hide the fact that he idolizes Alfred Hitchcock. This movie absolutely delivers in accordance with that tradition. Mr. Hitchcock would be proud if he saw this movie. If you liked The Birds you will probably like The Happening. It makes you twitch, wince, and jump - all earmarks of a good scary movie.The most common error I see among those who dislike Night's recent films, is that they compare them to The Sixth Sense and Signs (two very different movies by the way). I think Night has decided to do what he wants to do. He is an artist. If his career is ended, at least no one can accuse him of playing it safe.  My guess is that people who frequently criticize Night movies are about as deep as a shallow bath tub. His movies go right over their heads. They prefer popcorn flicks where there is nothing to contemplate, and always a pretty ending. They probably thought the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie was good!Shyamalan is not without his flaws. By no means do I see his films as perfect. But they are in a different league than most Hollywood drivel. The fact that he is largely unappreciated makes me like him even more. Bravo Mr. Shyamalan!

Night Shyamalan's THE HAPPENING (not to mention all of his post-SIXTH SENSE output). Now, I'm going to confine my review to THE HAPPENING -- allowing my evaluation of it to be based on that film alone, and not in comparison to his others.THE HAPPENING is a moody, atmospheric, claustrophobic and paranoidal film. It is a creepy journey through a world threatened with an ""ultimate threat"". It is not meant to be a naturalistic nor realistic film, rather a symbolic or impressionistic one. Some have labeled it as ""environmental propaganda"" -- clearly the mere cursory mention of ""green house effect"" toward the start of the film is enough to set some people into near-catatonic fits of rage! I merely viewed THE HAPPENING as a ""what if"" scenario, an imaginative tale exploring several characters faced with a crisis that seems to be caused by nature. In short, it is ""only a movie"" -- feel free to keep saying it to yourself if you need the comfort! Shyamalan could have easily chosen zombies (as in Romero's  NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) or  technology (as in Stephen King's CELL, for example)or Martian's (WAR OF THE WORLDS) or even cannibals (Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD) as his ""ultimate threat"". Obviously, Shyamalan's muse or inspiration came in the form of nature. It's a funny thing, artistic inspiration. Ten writers can look at an apple on a table, for instance, and who knows what ideas are/are not triggered by said apple!I myself sat down to watch THE HAPPENING having heard/been told so many terrible things about it. I chose to view it with an open mind. I also chose to watch it on my own, allowing myself to be immersed in the world presented. The atmosphere that Shyamalan and co. create is palpable (Say what you like about M. Night, but he is truly a master of mood, so important in the types of films he makes).I truly enjoyed this film. It IS moody, it IS mysterious, it IS harrowing. In a pandemic situation, the wind WOULD BE menacing and nightmarish (a chainsaw-wielding maniac in a dead-skin mask is not the only type of menace that has the propensity to rattle the nerves).I also found the relationship between Elliot and Alma very heartfelt and involving. The ""mystery"" of their circumstances was definitely a key element in the effectiveness of this film. M. Night's choice of ending for these two character's was a very wise one indeed. Another of Night's strengths is in developing normal people and thrusting them into such extra-ordinary circumstances, of making you believe in and care about them (much like Stephen King). All one need do is forget the expectation/hype (informed by previous work/s) and just enjoy the experience.",4,"Moody, Atmospheric, Paranoidal...",1298246400,"02 21, 2011",2011,2737,"['lot', 'actually', 'make', 'A', 'LOT', 'bad', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'said', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'THE', 'HAPPENING', 'not', 'mention', 'post-SIXTH', 'SENSE', 'output', 'Now', ""'m"", 'going', 'confine', 'review', 'THE', 'HAPPENING', 'allowing', 'evaluation', 'be', 'based', 'film', 'alone', 'not', 'comparison', 'others.THE', 'HAPPENING', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'claustrophobic', 'paranoidal', 'film', 'creepy', 'journey', 'world', 'threatened', 'ultimate', 'threat', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'naturalistic', 'realistic', 'film', 'rather', 'symbolic', 'impressionistic', 'one', 'have', 'labeled', 'environmental', 'propaganda', 'clearly', 'mere', 'cursory', 'mention', 'green', 'house', 'effect', 'start', 'film', 'enough', 'set', 'people', 'near-catatonic', 'fits', 'rage', 'merely', 'viewed', 'THE', 'HAPPENING', 'what', 'scenario', 'imaginative', 'tale', 'exploring', 'several', 'characters', 'faced', 'crisis', 'be', 'caused', 'nature', 'short', 'only', 'movie', 'feel', 'free', 'keep', 'saying', 'yourself', 'need', 'comfort', 'Shyamalan', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'chosen', 'zombies', 'Romero', 'NIGHT', 'THE', 'LIVING', 'DEAD', 'technology', 'Stephen', 'King', 'CELL', 'example', 'Martian', 'WAR', 'THE', 'WORLDS', 'even', 'cannibals', 'Cormac', 'McCarthy', 'THE', 'ROAD', 'ultimate', 'threat', 'Obviously', 'Shyamalan', 'muse', 'inspiration', 'came', 'form', 'nature', 'funny', 'thing', 'artistic', 'inspiration', 'Ten', 'writers', 'can', 'look', 'apple', 'table', 'instance', 'who', 'what', 'ideas', 'are/are', 'not', 'triggered', 'said', 'apple', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'THE', 'HAPPENING', 'having', 'heard/been', 'told', 'so', 'many', 'terrible', 'things', 'chose', 'view', 'open', 'mind', 'also', 'chose', 'watch', 'own', 'allowing', 'be', 'immersed', 'world', 'presented', 'atmosphere', 'Shyamalan', 'co.', 'create', 'palpable', 'Say', 'what', 'like', 'M.', 'Night', 'truly', 'master', 'mood', 'so', 'important', 'types', 'films', '.I', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'moody', 'mysterious', 'harrowing', 'pandemic', 'situation', 'wind', 'WOULD', 'BE', 'menacing', 'nightmarish', 'chainsaw-wielding', 'maniac', 'dead-skin', 'mask', 'not', 'only', 'type', 'menace', 'propensity', 'rattle', 'nerves', '.I', 'also', 'found', 'relationship', 'Elliot', 'Alma', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'involving', 'mystery', 'circumstances', 'was', 'definitely', 'key', 'element', 'effectiveness', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'choice', 'ending', 'two', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'wise', 'one', 'indeed', 'Night', 'strengths', 'developing', 'normal', 'people', 'thrusting', 'such', 'extra-ordinary', 'circumstances', 'making', 'believe', 'care', 'much', 'Stephen', 'King', 'one', 'need', 'do', 'forget', 'expectation/hype', 'informed', 'previous', 'work/s', 'just', 'enjoy', 'experience']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[2, 5]","There's a lot wrong with The Happening.At base, The Happening is a nightmarish parable about our crowded society in modern times.  We threaten the world, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to say, with our sheer numbers.  On the other hand, being completely isolated isn't the solution either, creating a suspicious, isolationist attitude that leads to a self-destructive spiral.But The Happening is mostly about watching people commit suicide in terrible ways.  This ranges from terrible echoes of 9/11, when workmen jump from a building to their death, to the cartoonishly absurd, when a zookeeper taunts a lion and it tears his arm off.  Anyone who watches the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet knows that big cats go for the neck first.Anyway, The Happening's premise is spooky: what if something in the wind made people commit suicide in the most immediate and awful way possible?  Where would you go?  What would you do?Night has all the elements of a good horror story: the aforementioned disaster, the strained relationship between Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and even an innocent little girl (Ashlyn Sanchez) thrown in for good measure.The Happening should be a great horror film.  It's spooky.  The premise that a gust of wind could bring about a fatal, nightmarish end lends an ominous shadow to the events. We can expect plenty of drama, morally ambiguous choices, and desperate survival tactics as our protagonists flee for their lives from an alien foe.Actually, I was just describing Spielberg's War of the Worlds, which took the same premise and made a creepy, nuanced film about parents, children, and the distance between them. The two films have a lot in common: the insidious enemy that pops up out of nowhere, the little girl in distress, the long journey against all odds to a haven that might already have been destroyed.The Happening follows the same script but fails miserably on almost all counts. Oh, Night's got the scary part down.  But what carries a film like this is the emotional heft of characters brought to the brink.  Wahlberg does a workman-like job of trying to be clever and sarcastic, but the script forces him to spew mouthfuls of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook at a rapid fire pace that he can't keep up.  Deschanel, never a strong actress to begin with, is comedically awful.  There isn't the slightest romantic tension between her and Wahlberg.  And the little girl?  She barely says a word.The list of what's wrong goes on and on: citizens leave New York in an orderly fashion without snarling any mass transit; victims go to inordinate and improbable lengths to kill themselves; a father abandons his only child in a vain quest to find his wife; nobody seems to think traveling with a gas mask might be a good idea except two old ladies sitting at home.They're the smart ones.",2,Wait...What Happening?,1257379200,"11 5, 2009",2009,2870,"['lot', 'wrong', 'Happening.At', 'base', 'Happening', 'nightmarish', 'parable', 'crowded', 'society', 'modern', 'times', 'threaten', 'world', 'director', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'say', 'sheer', 'numbers', 'other', 'hand', 'being', 'completely', 'isolated', ""n't"", 'solution', 'either', 'creating', 'suspicious', 'isolationist', 'attitude', 'self-destructive', 'spiral.But', 'Happening', 'mostly', 'watching', 'people', 'commit', 'suicide', 'terrible', 'ways', 'terrible', 'echoes', '9/11', 'when', 'workmen', 'jump', 'building', 'death', 'cartoonishly', 'absurd', 'when', 'zookeeper', 'lion', 'arm', 'off', 'Anyone', 'who', 'Discovery', 'Channel', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'big', 'cats', 'go', 'neck', 'first.Anyway', 'Happening', 'premise', 'spooky', 'what', 'something', 'wind', 'made', 'people', 'commit', 'suicide', 'most', 'immediate', 'awful', 'way', 'possible', 'Where', 'would', 'go', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Night', 'elements', 'good', 'horror', 'story', 'aforementioned', 'disaster', 'strained', 'relationship', 'Elliott', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'distant', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'even', 'innocent', 'little', 'girl', 'Ashlyn', 'Sanchez', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.The', 'Happening', 'should', 'be', 'great', 'horror', 'film', 'spooky', 'premise', 'gust', 'wind', 'could', 'bring', 'about', 'fatal', 'nightmarish', 'end', 'ominous', 'shadow', 'events', 'can', 'expect', 'plenty', 'drama', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'choices', 'desperate', 'survival', 'tactics', 'protagonists', 'flee', 'lives', 'alien', 'foe.Actually', 'was', 'just', 'describing', 'Spielberg', 'War', 'Worlds', 'took', 'same', 'premise', 'made', 'creepy', 'nuanced', 'film', 'parents', 'children', 'distance', 'two', 'films', 'have', 'lot', 'common', 'insidious', 'enemy', 'nowhere', 'little', 'girl', 'distress', 'long', 'journey', 'odds', 'haven', 'might', 'already', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed.The', 'Happening', 'same', 'script', 'miserably', 'almost', 'counts', 'Oh', 'Night', 'got', 'scary', 'part', 'down', 'what', 'film', 'emotional', 'heft', 'characters', 'brought', 'brink', 'Wahlberg', 'workman-like', 'job', 'trying', 'be', 'clever', 'sarcastic', 'script', 'spew', 'mouthfuls', 'pseudo-scientific', 'gobbledygook', 'rapid', 'fire', 'pace', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'up', 'Deschanel', 'never', 'strong', 'actress', 'begin', 'comedically', 'awful', ""n't"", 'slightest', 'romantic', 'tension', 'Wahlberg', 'little', 'girl', 'barely', 'word.The', 'list', 'what', 'wrong', 'citizens', 'leave', 'New', 'York', 'orderly', 'fashion', 'snarling', 'mass', 'transit', 'victims', 'go', 'inordinate', 'improbable', 'lengths', 'kill', 'father', 'only', 'child', 'vain', 'quest', 'find', 'wife', 'nobody', 'think', 'traveling', 'gas', 'mask', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'two', 'old', 'ladies', 'sitting', 'home.They', ""'re"", 'smart', 'ones']",N/A

A breeze comes up in Central Park, . . . and suddenly, people are walking off tall buildings, shooting themselves in the street, driving their cars into trees. Is it terrorists? No, actually, it appears to be a plot by trees and grass to rid the world of those pesky humans. Mark Wahlberg plays Elliot, a high school science teacher, who heads out of town with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and the young daughter of his best friend, looking for a lightly inhabited area to hide out. (The plant plot initially affects large congregations of people, but it's working its way down to smaller and smaller groups.) There's a certain amount of confusion in the script, and I sort of expected a big ""THE END?"" in the last scene, but I'm going to be generous and assume Shyamalan was doing a homage to `50s science fiction film. SIXTH SENSE was terrific but SIGNS big time; this one is somewhere inbetween.

Night's movies (NOT The Village, obviously) and even liked Lady in the Water (I know, I can hear the groans). But the The Happening completely missed the mark.It was designed as an apocolyptic thriller combined with a side story of the two main characters (played by Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel) rediscovering their love for each other during the deadly attack that occurs throughout most of the movie.I'll give my reasons as to why this movie failed:1) ZERO chemistry between Wahlberg and Deschanel.2) Deschanel was wooden and emotionless for most of the movie. She is not a good actor.3) John Leguizamo seemed to be wondering ""Why can't I get better scripts than this?"" Though he made the most of the material he was dealt.4) Wahlberg's part is so terribly written that you can see him struggling to find his character's identity for the entire movie. He ultimately settles on some bland, wimpy personage devoid of any personality whatsoever.5) The apocolyptic thriller has been done way better by others. Even The Day After Tomorrow did a better job.I gave this movie 2 stars mainly due to the beautiful cinematography. This IS one of M. Night's strengths, after all. But with this effort, he moves closer to Spike Lee as a director who places style over substance. Maybe M.

It started with the village, but it was the Happening where it really started to hit us that M. Night Shyamalan is a hack director that peaked way to soon. The Happening is not only called one of the worst Shyamalan films, but one of the worst films in general. It is by no means a good movie, but it's not the worst movie I've ever seen either. I will say that I enjoy this more than the Village.The one good thing about the film is the beginning. This movie started out really good actually. It starts out with random people just start killing themselves. There is this sense of mystery and suspense in the first part. The atmosphere is great also. Like most Shyamalan films, the film does have an interesting premise. However, like with most Shyamalan films, the execution of that premise is sorely lacking.While the beginning was great it is ruined by the middle portion. During the middle half of the film they give an explanation for what is happening, which is one of the lamest explanations you can get. I would have preferred that you keep what was causing it a mystery, and let the viewer draw their own conclusions. The sense of mystery and intrigue is taken away by that lame explanation.To make things worse the acting is atrocious, particularly by Mark Wahlberg. He is so over-the-top that scenes that are supposed to be taken seriously become unintentionally funny. The supporting cast are no better. Zooey Deschanel and the actress who played the little girl do a horrible job acting wise. There is no life in their performances. The background characters do a terrible job even. Some of the dialog is just so cheesy and corny!Then during the third act of the film we spend a good chunk of time with this psycho granny. I felt I was watching a different movie. What was the point of the psycho granny plot element? She did not add anything to the plot.Overall the Happening is a terrible film! It's one of Shyamalan's worst. I do enjoy it better than the Village. I like the premise more in this movie. Plus I at least can laugh at Mark Wahlberg's over-the-top performance.

However it comes laden with expectation - it's a Shymalayan movie - so what's the hook, and what's the twist!Well, the hook is that mysterious deaths start occurring in the NE of the United States.  Confusion reigns, as the news alternates between fear this is a terrorist attack, to the gradual realization this is.. well, just in case you haven't seen it yet I won't spoil the only `surprise' in the movie.  But wait, there IS another surprise - when did Mark Wahlberg become such a dismal actor!  The lines, the delivery, the timing, everything is just what you'd expect from a poorly edited 70's grindhouse movie.  Can he be doing it deliberately as an in-joke?  If so, the jokes on him because its cringe-worthy.  If you can just take it at a B-movie level, you might get some satisfaction - because there isn't anything else to enjoy in the movie.  The director has lost his flair for the gradual reveal, the careful structure, and the cinematic tools as storytelling devices.. it's a movie that is no more then the lowest denominator you might expect a movie with a plot like this to have.The extras talk much about how this was the director's exciting foray into the world of an adult rating.  And true, some of the deaths are disconcerting, and yes, there is maybe one cheap shock to be had, but sadly it's all so straightforward, and lacks any impact, except the occasional moment of impact as you hit the wall with your head at the ineptitude.As for the twist - there is none. It's just one of those movies that you keep thinking it will go somewhere and it goes on, and on.. then.. sort of ends.  And that's it.Extras - deleted scenes are more of the same, gag reel is not as funny as some of the actual lines in the movie, featurettes are slight and frustratingly broken up into 5 to 10 minute chunks.

The Happening, however, was one of the dumbest films I've watched in a very long time! The Happening is the latest film by M. Night Shyamalan in which people mysteriously stop dead in their tracks and begin killing themselves for no apparent reason. The premise itself was kind of scary, but the other storylines and the obvious overacting by Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel grated my nerves. You always expect people to do stupid things in horror movies, but this lot acted like they had lost all sense completely.The only things that made this movie tense were the cringe-worthy death scenes (Shyamalan made sure to point out that this is his first rated R film) and the stupidity and loss of common sense shared by the characters. Obviously fear causes people to do strange things, but after a while I just didn't care anymore.Mark Wahlberg should stick what he does best - playing characters out for revenge. His take as a high school science teacher was horrible. The scene at the beginning of the movie where he is in class trying to explain the (true) disappearance of thousands of honey bees recently made me want to scream. For some reason Wahlberg talks to his students, who are at least 15 years of age or older, in a high-pitched patronizing tone. While I would have loved to have had a science teacher like him when I was in high school, the way he talked to his students was extremely annoying. I'm not even going to go into the bad performance by Zooey Deschanel, who plays Wahlberg's wife. I haven't seen much from her, but if I had to go by this performance, I'd tell her to find another career.So, in closing, do not see this movie. It's not worth your time and I don't think you'll enjoy it very much.

So I took a chance and bought it. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed.The Pros: Like with all his movies, M.Night delivers to us a metric ton of suspense, rolled into a movie with a simple conflict. He manages to create a suspense movie that borders on horror without ever showing us a monster. The premise of the movie itself, coupled with what we see happening to the 'victims', is terrible disturbing without being graphic. It hardly showed anything at all, but several times I squealed or shouted "" WHAT THE F--K!"" to my husband, who even came out of the other room from a bid on WOW to see what had gotten his famous horror-movie loving spouse  to exclaim so. M.Night creates fantasy with little actual graphics. There is almost no special effects in this movie that you could pick out, and I LOVED that. Like all his movies, it felt rich and authentic, and I prize that in a movie maker.The Cons: Mark Whalberg. Several times I thought he was reading dialog off screen, like he couldn't get his lines right. His acting felt shallow and un-engaging. If I were M.Night and dead set on a Whalberg, I'd of picked Donnie. At least Donnie knows how to act.All in all, M. Night delivers again, with something that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I'll keep watching his movies. He has an incredible gift for creating fantasy.

What you want from that kind of film are massive explosions, car crashes, tornadoes, zombies or monsters or ghosts, and big budget special effects, all tied together into some kind of coherent narrative with escalating action, leading to a climax in which (usually) the hero saves the world (or at least the local community) and achieves some kind of much needed reconciliation with his/her family.While there are elements of all that inThe Happening, what you really get here is something else, more subtle and strange, that alternates between the utterly mundane and the overblown melodramatic, between everyday moments and terrifying extremes.  There isn't really a sense of escalating action, but more inaction punctuated with crisis situations.  For the most part the feeling is sustained by a subtly creepy intensity mixed with moments of somewhat silly, interrupted by a few sudden and inexplicable and gory moments, inventive acts of self-destruction, all designed to shock and amuse.  If you go into this expecting something else, the style here can look like incompetence.  What struck me watching it the first time in theaters and even more on subsequent viewings in the home is that this is much more like a Japanese than American style horror film.  M. Night Shyamalan effectively made a ""J-horror"" flick.  Many of the very same features that some were bugged by in this film appear in spades in ""J-Horror"" films and are accepted as cultural oddities - I think there is a greater tolerance for unconventional stylings when they appear in a foreign language.  I suspect that if this had been an Asian film with subtitles, but otherwise identical, many critics who panned it would have proclaimed it brilliantly ironic and inventive.In J-horror (such asRinguorDark WaterorSuicide Club, or, even better,Pulse) the focus tends to be on ordinary people, caught up in an inexplicable and seemingly supernatural situation, usually where some kind of force is out to avenge itself for some offence and doesn't really care who suffers, only cares that they suffer.  Part of what generates dread in these films is that the audience is aware of a real and potent threat, that the protagonists only gradually come to accept as real.  Moreover, it quickly becomes apparent there is no escape, and the threat is uncaring and implacable.  These films usually aren't plotted in the so-called ""Hollywood style,"" where a character must act to face up to an escalating challenge that is both broadly significant and deeply personal.  In J-horror, the ultimate outcome is just not up to the characters.  They can't rise to the challenge, and the escalating dread comes from the fact that their efforts eventually come to nothing.  If they end up escaping, that is as inexplicable as the initial danger; while they may resolve personal issues, the larger issue represented by the threat remains unresolved.  While the story itself often meanders and reactions often alternate between overblown and understated, what ties it together are a series of horrific images, that are not so much explicit as highly suggestive.  Anyone who's seen ""The Happening"" should recognize that it fits easily with this general pattern - Frank Darabont'sThe Mistworks along similar lines, but is closer to conventional horror film expectations.Where the film deviates from the general framework is in its fairly unambiguous (pseudoscientific) explanations of the ultimate grounds of the inexplicable happenings.  Still, if it is blunt in its environmental message, it is also bluntly ironic about the likelihood of any changes taking place as a result of the kind of massive ecological catastrophe depicted here.  I found it to be a lot of fun to watch, and when I saw it again with my wife, we were both entertained.  My sense is that much of the disappointment about Shyamalan comes from expecting him to make the usual kind of Hollywood blockbuster films, when what he really does best is something more akin to American independent and foreign horror films.",3,"I found this eco-horror flick to be much better than they said -- not a conventional Hollywood thriller, much closer to J-horror",1251244800,"08 26, 2009",2009,4149,"['go', 'Happening', 'expecting', 'American', 'style', 'horror/disaster', 'flick', ""'re"", 'bound', 'be', 'disappointed', 'What', 'want', 'kind', 'film', 'are', 'massive', 'explosions', 'car', 'crashes', 'tornadoes', 'zombies', 'monsters', 'ghosts', 'big', 'budget', 'special', 'effects', 'tied', 'together', 'kind', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'escalating', 'action', 'leading', 'climax', 'usually', 'hero', 'world', 'least', 'local', 'community', 'kind', 'much', 'needed', 'reconciliation', 'his/her', 'family.While', 'are', 'elements', 'inThe', 'Happening', 'what', 'really', 'get', 'here', 'something', 'else', 'more', 'subtle', 'strange', 'utterly', 'mundane', 'overblown', 'melodramatic', 'everyday', 'moments', 'terrifying', 'extremes', ""n't"", 'really', 'sense', 'escalating', 'action', 'more', 'inaction', 'punctuated', 'crisis', 'situations', 'most', 'part', 'feeling', 'sustained', 'subtly', 'creepy', 'intensity', 'mixed', 'moments', 'somewhat', 'silly', 'interrupted', 'few', 'sudden', 'inexplicable', 'gory', 'moments', 'inventive', 'acts', 'self-destruction', 'designed', 'shock', 'amuse', 'go', 'expecting', 'something', 'else', 'style', 'here', 'can', 'look', 'incompetence', 'What', 'struck', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'theaters', 'even', 'more', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'home', 'much', 'more', 'Japanese', 'American', 'style', 'horror', 'film', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'effectively', 'made', 'J-horror', 'flick', 'Many', 'very', 'same', 'features', 'were', 'bugged', 'film', 'appear', 'spades', 'J-Horror', 'films', 'are', 'accepted', 'cultural', 'oddities', 'think', 'greater', 'tolerance', 'unconventional', 'stylings', 'when', 'appear', 'foreign', 'language', 'suspect', 'had', 'been', 'Asian', 'film', 'subtitles', 'otherwise', 'identical', 'many', 'critics', 'who', 'panned', 'would', 'have', 'proclaimed', 'brilliantly', 'ironic', 'inventive.In', 'J-horror', 'such', 'asRinguorDark', 'WaterorSuicide', 'Club', 'even', 'better', 'Pulse', 'focus', 'be', 'ordinary', 'people', 'caught', 'up', 'inexplicable', 'seemingly', 'supernatural', 'situation', 'usually', 'where', 'kind', 'force', 'out', 'avenge', 'offence', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'who', 'suffers', 'only', 'suffer', 'Part', 'what', 'dread', 'films', 'audience', 'aware', 'real', 'potent', 'threat', 'protagonists', 'only', 'gradually', 'come', 'accept', 'real', 'Moreover', 'quickly', 'apparent', 'escape', 'threat', 'uncaring', 'implacable', 'films', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'plotted', 'so-called', 'Hollywood', 'style', 'where', 'character', 'must', 'act', 'face', 'up', 'escalating', 'challenge', 'broadly', 'significant', 'deeply', 'personal', 'J-horror', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'just', 'not', 'up', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rise', 'challenge', 'escalating', 'dread', 'fact', 'efforts', 'eventually', 'come', 'nothing', 'end', 'up', 'escaping', 'as', 'inexplicable', 'initial', 'danger', 'may', 'resolve', 'personal', 'issues', 'larger', 'issue', 'represented', 'threat', 'unresolved', 'story', 'often', 'meanders', 'reactions', 'often', 'alternate', 'overblown', 'understated', 'what', 'together', 'are', 'series', 'horrific', 'images', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'explicit', 'highly', 'suggestive', 'Anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Happening', 'should', 'recognize', 'easily', 'general', 'pattern', 'Frank', ""Darabont'sThe"", 'Mistworks', 'similar', 'lines', 'closer', 'conventional', 'horror', 'film', 'expectations.Where', 'film', 'general', 'framework', 'fairly', 'unambiguous', 'pseudoscientific', 'explanations', 'ultimate', 'grounds', 'inexplicable', 'happenings', 'Still', 'blunt', 'environmental', 'message', 'also', 'bluntly', 'ironic', 'likelihood', 'changes', 'taking', 'place', 'result', 'kind', 'massive', 'ecological', 'catastrophe', 'depicted', 'here', 'found', 'be', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'when', 'saw', 'again', 'wife', 'were', 'entertained', 'sense', 'much', 'disappointment', 'Shyamalan', 'expecting', 'make', 'usual', 'kind', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'when', 'what', 'really', 'best', 'something', 'more', 'akin', 'American', 'independent', 'foreign', 'horror', 'films']",N/A

After crafting smashing flicks like The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, it seemed as Shyamalan couldn't do wrong.  Then we had The Village and Lady in the Water; end of story.  Maybe that's why I looked so forward to The Happening, as it seemed as if Shyamalan may have re-discovered what made his films so good in the first place.  Heavily marketed as being his first R-rated film, The Happening is instead mammothly disappointing as a horror film or paranoid thriller, and for it's relatively brisk running time, just seems to meander along.  Mark Wahlberg stars as a science teacher in a failing marriage who, along with his wife (Zooey Deschanel) and fellow teacher (John Leguizamo) go on the run when a toxin hits the air, causing people to kill themselves.  While The Happening gets off to a great start with some wonderfully creepy and graphic moments, it loses its momentum as the story drags on.  It doesn't help that Wahlberg and Deschanel are miscast either, and in the end we just don't care about the characters at all.  Still though, Shyamalan manages to inject enough disturbing imagery into the film to be able to get under your skin, and suggests that maybe he's looking to get into an edgier kind of film making instead of the tried and true ""PG-13 with a twist at the end"" kind of deal.  All in all, The Happening isn't an entirely horrible film (and much better than Lady in the Water mind you), but it's still a disappointing endeavor from a once heralded director.

This was soon followed by Unbreakable, a movie that cemented Bruce Willis as one of the top actors of the 1990s.  It was also a breakthrough film for the comic-book genre.  Then came Signs and the Village, two films that though still innovative and original, had many detractors.  Finally, it seems Mr. Night's magic has run out.  Lady in the Water barely broke even at the box office, and then came the outright bomb, The Happening.  Starring two familiar, but not blockbuster names, this movie adds a twist to a well-worn genre.  A plague has hit the northeastern section of the US that causes people to commit suicide.  The movie then follows a married couple's run from the plague.  Clues are dropped throughout the movie as to the source of the plague, plants.  Quite an original idea; sounds like a great premise for a great suspense, thriller, or horror movie.  This movie is none of those.  From the opening scene, the movie is quite apparent that something is up with the plants.  And of course the plants are seen swaying in the wind right before people start committing suicide - all throughout the movie.  So there goes the suspence, the foreboding, the fear of the unknown.

I was expecting it to be laughably bad like Lady in the Water (which was inexplicable, and a complete waste of time awful)  .  That expectation was based on the similarly bad reviews.

Their weapon is a neurotoxin. Shylaman could have revealed this in a much more subtle and interesting way, revealing it slowly over time as people panic, making it a true horror piece, instead it is similar in my opinion to the ""swing away"" line plus the baseball bat hanging on the wall in Signs.

There are a couple off the wall strange shylaman only sequences of course and one very funny scene where Wahlberg is talking to a tree they have discovered in a house, telling it ""we come in peace"" essentially, only to find out it is plastic.

1183946,ARIHVRQ9VH0OQ,B001DZOC3W,Nick Schwartz,"[5, 10]","-This review contains VERY MINOR SPOILERS-Many might argue that since ""Unbreakable"" - some might even argue since ""The Sixth Sense"" - M. Night Shyamalan has built a reputation for ruining his films in the third act, after building incredible momentum during the opening hour or so.  ""Signs"" was fantastically suspenseful until the alien appeared in all its CGI glory and ""Lady in the Water"", while pleasing to the eye, suffered from a second half that was structurally a mess.  Well, the tradition continues with the third act of ""The Happening,"" but to a much lesser extent.  By no means do the weaker final twenty minutes detract from the overall experience.  This film has the potential to redeem Shyamalan as a director of solid suspense.I must admit, that I fell prey to the hype, and was curious to see if Shyamalan could deliver with an R-rating.  He has.  This is not a gore film, though there are a few bloody moments that may have viewers turning away.  It isn't a horror film either.  This is a suspense story, through and through, and Shyamalan utilizes the R-rating to keep the audience uneasy and at the edge of their seats.  This is a seriously disturbing film, and while not overtly violent (much of the violence takes place off-screen), it is filled with haunting imagery that will stick with you long after you leave the theater.Strangely the third act is ruined not by the now trademark Shyamalan-twist ending (SPOILER ALERT: there really isn't one to speak of).  Instead, by trying to maintain an extra-high level of suspense, it falls victim to the introduction of a cliche horror character: a borderline crazy old woman who lives by herself in a house without power, whose occasional crazy behavior serves not to further the plot, but instead to coax a few more jolts from the audience.Apart from a few moments of preaching about humanity's effect on the environment, the rest of the ending works remarkably well.Through a bit of a coincidence, I actually wound up seeing this film twice last night, the screenings quite literally back-to-back.  And while there was absolutely nothing new to be gained by the second viewing, I still found myself enjoying the ride.  And that's the best thing that can be said about Shyamalan's latest effort.

1183948,AX9FFS9AIVLV6,B001DZOC3W,NoLongerHere,"[2, 6]","I go to see M. Knight Shyamalan movies with a grain of salt: I expect that I won't like his movies, and am usually slightly disappointed.  The Happening was a psychological thriller utilizing an older, more 'Hitchcock' variable in horror and monsters.  The true monsters here were average people, made to become their worst by pollen spawned from righteous trees, plants and grasses.  On the breezes of warm summer days, the pollen flowed throughout the world, claiming victims and working to rid the world of an over-burdening populace.  The plants and trees of the world decided to kill off the human race and, scientifically speaking, their attempt was nearly fool proof.The movie, however, was a bit slow, and in perfect M. Knight Shyamalan-ese, it made little sense to most of those who watched it.  I got it - that's not to say I'm some genius or above the masses who hated this movie, it's just to say I got it.  I liked this movie, I was scared by it, and I left the theater thinking about it.  The full intent of the director - the more you think about the possibilities, the scarier they become.He's not the greatest director - I liked the Sixth Sense, but I absolutely despised Unbreakable.  I like the Village, but I absolutely despised Lady in the Water.  And Signs was terrible, though it could have been so much better.That's what I can say mostly about the Happening - it could have been better, but it wouldn't have been M. Knight Shyamalan's movie then.  He spins a very odd tale, and does not confine himself to American story telling standards.  Sometimes there simply isn't a ""good"" ending in story telling.  Sometimes the only reason for the story is to make you think.With the Happening, the story itself was interesting; the acting however, could have been better.  Marky-Mark isn't the best actor, he's almost as wooden as Keanu Reeves, and John Leguisamo never seems to get the 'right' part in any movie he's in - I'd love to see him in a true break-out role, something that would show his real acting ability.Overall, not a terrible movie - rent it first and decide for yourself.",3,Not As Terrible As Some Would Have You Believe,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,2106,"['go', 'see', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'movies', 'grain', 'salt', 'expect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'am', 'usually', 'slightly', 'disappointed', 'Happening', 'was', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'utilizing', 'older', 'more', 'variable', 'horror', 'monsters', 'true', 'monsters', 'here', 'were', 'average', 'people', 'made', 'become', 'worst', 'pollen', 'spawned', 'righteous', 'trees', 'plants', 'grasses', 'breezes', 'warm', 'summer', 'days', 'pollen', 'flowed', 'world', 'claiming', 'victims', 'working', 'rid', 'world', 'over-burdening', 'populace', 'plants', 'trees', 'world', 'decided', 'kill', 'off', 'human', 'race', 'scientifically', 'speaking', 'attempt', 'was', 'nearly', 'fool', 'proof.The', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'bit', 'slow', 'perfect', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan-ese', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'most', 'who', 'watched', 'got', 'not', 'say', ""'m"", 'genius', 'masses', 'who', 'hated', 'movie', 'just', 'say', 'got', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'scared', 'left', 'theater', 'thinking', 'full', 'intent', 'director', 'more', 'think', 'possibilities', 'scarier', 'become.He', 'not', 'greatest', 'director', 'liked', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'absolutely', 'despised', 'Unbreakable', 'Village', 'absolutely', 'despised', 'Lady', 'Water', 'Signs', 'was', 'terrible', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better.That', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'mostly', 'Happening', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'M.', 'Knight', 'Shyamalan', 'movie', 'then', 'very', 'odd', 'tale', 'not', 'confine', 'American', 'story', 'telling', 'standards', 'Sometimes', 'simply', ""n't"", 'good', 'ending', 'story', 'telling', 'only', 'reason', 'story', 'make', 'think.With', 'Happening', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'acting', 'however', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Marky-Mark', ""n't"", 'best', 'actor', 'almost', 'as', 'wooden', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'John', 'Leguisamo', 'never', 'get', ""'right"", 'part', 'movie', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'true', 'break-out', 'role', 'something', 'would', 'show', 'real', 'acting', 'ability.Overall', 'not', 'terrible', 'movie', 'rent', 'first', 'decide']",N/A

Night Shyamalan is a horrifically overrated moviemaker.  I have been duly unimpressed with some of his earlier efforts, but this one takes the proverbial cake.  Bad acting, a bad storyline, an anemic cast, and a heavy dose of left-wing eco-propaganda all combine to make this an eminently forgettable story -- except for the indelible scar that it has left on my beleaguered psyche.  There's really no need to say much more.  Other reviewers have already told more than we really need to know.  In an effort to set this one in proper context, however, I will conclude by noting that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has found a soulmate.",1,Oy.,1232323200,"01 19, 2009",2009,712,"['Happening', 'just', 'piece', 'growing', 'mountain', 'evidence', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'horrifically', 'overrated', 'moviemaker', 'have', 'been', 'duly', 'unimpressed', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'one', 'proverbial', 'cake', 'Bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'storyline', 'anemic', 'cast', 'heavy', 'dose', 'left-wing', 'eco-propaganda', 'combine', 'make', 'eminently', 'forgettable', 'story', 'indelible', 'scar', 'left', 'beleaguered', 'psyche', 'really', 'need', 'say', 'much', 'more', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'told', 'more', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'effort', 'set', 'one', 'proper', 'context', 'however', 'will', 'conclude', 'noting', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', 'found', 'soulmate']",N/A
1183950,A1F72LRP98VC96,B001DZOC3W,Ollie,"[5, 6]","I would not consider myself a M. Night Shyamalan fan, however I did enjoy 'The Sixth Sense' and to a lesser degree 'Signs' and consider 'Unbreakable' to be his best so far. On first viewing 'The Village' I was lead to believe that I enjoyed it even though the twist was pretty obvious for me, but on second viewing the plot holes stick out a mile and I now have no time for it and feel somewhat ashamed of myself for being sucked in on the the first viewing! I also hold my hands up and confess to enjoying 'Lady In The Water' first because Paul Giamatti gave a very good performance and probably more so because it was M. Night Shyamalan first straight film without the obligatory tired twist that he had come to be know for. Sure it was somewhat childish in the use of the fictional creatures names but I am prepared to over look that as the film as a whole, I find enjoyable for a reason I can't quite convincingly articulate in words.Now to The 'Happening', I'm not going to rip it apart as some have done as it is not as bad as I have been lead to believe but I'm also not going to praise it to the sky as others have. For me the biggest problem with 'The Happening' is the last 35 minutes. I was completely engaged as a viewer, intrigued with the plot and right there with the characters for the first hour as M. Night Shyamalan slowly revealed the story he wanted to tell. Unfortunately it seems to me that M. Night Shyamalan only had 50 minutes of story to tell and then hit writers block and realized that he had no idea where he was going with the story himself. The third act really has no revelations to give us to explain what has come before.To the positives as I see them regarding 'The Happening'. The first 50 minutes has the makings of a very good film. The idea that it could be a natural occurrence to me is intriguing and I accept this as reality while watching the film. As others have pointed out, the cinematography and editing are both faultless. M. Night Shyamalan direction is for the most part very good but somewhat hit and miss regarding the main leads. There is a limited musical score throughout which I found refreshing, M. Night Shyamalan tends to use naturally occurring ambient noise to draw the viewer into the story which I always find much more effective than telegraphing every plot point with pounding music. It almost seems a lost art form now to tell a story through the film camera rather than with it as has become almost the norm now in a large percentage of films today with the camera moving every 3 seconds and shaking all over the place. On the acting front, I can not fault the large majority of the actors in their performances. Zooey Deschanel has to do little more than appear on screen for me to find her acceptable! Some of the supporting characters were weird enough to be intriguing and added to the general atmosphere of the film during the first 50 minutes.To the negatives. Mark Wahlberg from his first line just did not feel right for me. I can't put my finger on what it is that I did not like about his performance but it just felt off. This may have been due to some of the dialogue M. Night Shyamalan provided for the character of Elliot Moore which to me seemed to be the most under written character in the whole film. Elliot Moore provided Mark Wahlberg with zero story arc over the 91 minute running time which makes me wonder if Wahlberg just signed on for the pay cheque thinking someone is going to do it so why not me? Back to the last 35 minutes, after the credits rolled at the end I was left thinking, well what really was the point of me sitting there for 91 minutes watching 'The Happening'. The last 35 minutes almost completely abandoned the nature based airborne attack on humans plot and turned into what felt like a tacked on sappy family relationship drama plot line with happy ending. What also took me right out of the film was the last 5 minutes, we skip forward 3 months and judging by the scenes in these last few minutes in particular, life seems to be completely normal as if nothing so traumatic as people killing themselves in all manner of ways ever happened and also the fact that the little girl seems to have gotten over not only the trauma of seeing first hand so much death but also the death of both her parents in less than 3 months and happily runs off to attend her first day in school.Is M. Night Shyamalan giving me the opportunity to decide myself if it was in fact a natural occurrence or was it something more sinister. If I am to accept that it was natural, then this raises even more questions regarding the plot such as why does it only effect certain people and why does it affect some people before others. Why did it only occur in a particular area of the US and why then in France next and not somewhere connected to the US such as Canada, Mexico or the entire South American continent, well because it's more dramatic for M. Night Shyamalan to tell us that it has jumped across the Atlantic ocean with no explanation so it must be bigger than just plants right? or is it!!? What did that certain section of the population in the US do that triggered the 'The Happening' and why did it occur in the US first at all? These questions and others raised by the script as written by M. Night Shyamalan simply smells of lazy writing to me which he tries to cover up by throwing in little pieces of science from various characters now and again. Does M. Night Shyamalan expect me to fill in so many of these blanks and do his job for him. I may even go so far as to say that M. Night Shyamalan probably figured he could sell the script regardless of his lazy writing because he is M. Night Shyamalan after all.To reviewers who have lavished this with 5 stars ratings, I am not saying that my opinion has anymore merit than others but I would ask some 5 star reviewers to review 'The Happening' as a singular motion picture and not to give it more credit than it is due based on their own interpretation of what it may or may not be about or that it is something different to the normal Hollywood blockbusters. M. Night Shyamalan had every intention I am sure of wanting this to be as big a blockbuster as 'The Sixth Sense', Unbreakable' or 'Signs' but he seems fresh out of stories he can sustain for 90 minutes now. Review what is shown on screen and not how you interpret the missing pieces. I would ask the same from 'The Happening' haters. Surely this is not as bad as 'The War Of the Worlds' remake!! The Happening does have high artistic merit which I feel was wasted in the end product.My final reflection, worth a rent just to see why this film generated so much debate which at the end of the day it does not deserve. See it and forget it. For me a 2 star rating simply because of the lazily written last 35 minutes and the complete lack of reality regarding any sign of human physiological damage that should have been sustained by probably everyone to some degree but even more so to the two main leads and in particular the little girl. 2 stars also reflect M. Night Shyamalan for making feel like I have to write such a long review for a film that is not worth it!",2,Held my interest up to a point.,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,7186,"['would', 'not',

It would be great to get them in the same film and have them chased by woodpeckers, termites and stuff, now that would be terrifying.I thought Zooey Deschamel was lovely and wonderful, a definite ""keeper"" in anyone's book, a Zooey Keeper in fact. Ho ho.Now I have got the puns out of the way, onto the film. The premise is ridiculous in the extreme, now, as a scientist, I am sure that there is much we don't know about plants, and yes, plants can produce chemicals to make them unattractive to potential predators, and yes, they can even communicate with other nearby plants of an attack to enable them to start producing the same chemical as well. This much is true. But the actual mechanism and effects themselves, it is just too silly. I am the first to recommend that in many cases, one should just put aside scientific realities for the sake of the film, but this just stretches it too far.If perhaps the chemical induced some sort of hallucinations or random psychotic behaviours, I would have gone for it a bit more. All the dramatic music and waving of grass in the breeze was just silly in the end I thought.Now, on to the direction. M Night Shyamalan is like a new test cricketer who started off with centuries in his first couple of matches, now; however, he is struggling to get the ball off the square. He just seems to have lost his touch and he really needs to get back to brass tacks, stop meddling too much and concentrate on getting the simple things right. There is no doubt that there are moments of tension in the film, but the overtly silliness of the plot means that you are never really fully drawn in.Mind you, I was never really enamoured with the director after seeing that preposterous ""documentary"" about him a few years back. Please tell me no one could be as self absorbed as that, please?And the ending, oh dear, again, lazy and contrived. Cut to the scene a few months after ""The Happening"" with the happy family walking down leafy streets full of plants. You can guarantee that if The Happening had actually Happened, there would have been a defoliation that would have made the whole Agent Orange thing look like a brisk whiff of ""Roundup"". Well, wouldn't you stamp on every blade of grass within a hundred miles if you thought the grass was going to rise up against you?

What happened to establishing the mood or something?"" Anyway, so it's already happening and we're gradually introduced to the focal characters. They leave the city, run around in the country-side for a bit until it's no longer happening, then go on with their lives as usual. Yup, I really did just sum the movie up. It's not a bad movie, in and of itself. What I mean by that is the production is very good (just look at all they work they put into creating a realistic car crash), the main characters are likable, and the threat is at least a little unsettling. However, other than a few graphic suicides, there really isn't any sense of a pressing threat bearing down on them. I know what you're thinking and I really wouldn't count being chased by the breeze as being terribly horrific or scary. In fact, those specific scenes make the movie feel a tad silly. In the first place, bushes and trees cannot stir or direct the wind. And do I even need to bring up how ludicrous an idea it seems, having the 'toxins' be selectively released by plants to target specific people and then the 'toxins' magically vanish? It would have been much more plausible and a lot more suspenseful if the threat were more persistent. And why not have it be caused by some chemical weapons leak in a government research facility? That, to me, would be much more realistic and scary than the idea of nature spontaneously evolving the ability to make people commit suicide. There's something about scientists playing with nature and creating monsters that, if done well, is one of the most chilling things I can think of. Anyone who's read Koontz's book, Watchers, will know what I mean... this movie could have been something like that, but it's not. Whatever is supposedly in the air is too vaguely defined and short-lived to feel truly menacing. The ending is also anti-climactic; the threat magically dissipates right when the lead couple are prepared to die, there's a jump of a few months, and now life is back to normal. So much for trying to be scary. In light of the way it ends, this movie does tend to rub off with the feeling of an ecological warning message, and a silly one at that. ""Better start recycling and stop cutting down trees before nature decides to fight back!""I would honestly have to say that Unbreakable and The Village are the only exceptional movies M. Night has directed. I should re-watch The 6th Sense, because I really don't remember it as being very remarkable. I look on pretty much all the rest of his work as either just plaid weird or mediocre. I declined seeing The Last Airbender, and apparently that was a good call on my part. I never got into the Anime, but it seems that a lot of the fans of the original series were thoroughly disappointed by Shyamalan's treatment.

Hopkins Jr.,"[1, 4]","It sounds like many who saw The Happening were looking for a 6th Sense twister ending or Saw level gore fest, and this film is neither.  The arrogance of man in the face of nature and/or nature fighting back is not a new idea. Writers have addressed this over the last 150 years including Stephen Crane, Jack London, Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) and Terry Gilliam (12 Monkeys, which interestingly does have a twist ending and Bruce Willis). As with M. Night's best films, this is a sharply defined character study shaped by events beyond the control of the individuals involved, and this is what gives the film its humanity. The idea that a toxin of some sort is shutting off the self-preservation mechanism in humans leading to their own demise, is not a far-fetched one.  And at every turn, we are treated to media takes on the events, which start with terrorism and end with government cover-up, writing off environmental possibilities entirely, though we have been equally treated to info concerning similar real natural occurrences throughout the film.  Most Americans scientific/medical interest and education doesn't extend much beyond concerns over the download speed of their i-phone or picking up their happy pills from their local Walgreen's.  As a result, most are too ignorant on this level to grasp the potential reality of such an event.  They know and care nothing of the days when microbes swept through entire cities as the common cold does today, but with a staggering death toll instead.  They know nothing of the largely smoothed over discoveries about the SSRI drug class, which may cause normally docile people to violently and mortally hurt themselves or others; a fact reduced to a warning label and extra FDA mandated handout about suicidal ideation.  Sadly, the point is lost on the very people who need to hear it most.  The film re-uses many suspense devices from film history.  My only quibble with The Happening is that the crazy old lady could have been better used than merely to amp up the suspense, since she was the one person in the whole movie who had actually divorced herself from the trappings of ""civilization"" and tended to her garden.

1183961,A3BVHPDNG36WO1,B001DZOC3W,"Phillip Royer ""sitenoise""","[5, 8]","Confession: I watched this movie and thought it was unrelentingly, embarrassingly bad. It looked pretty good, it had that Shyamalan style, but so much of the dialog felt bullied onto the characters. I couldn't believe how unnatural it sounded, how forced and amateurish it felt for the purpose of filling in plot. And it's a message flick--""we've abused the planet so don't be surprised if it fights back some day""--and message flicks, in my experience, are the worst offenders in the bad movie department because the message, and trying to make the point, often get in the way of making a good film.Then I read a brief comment from a reviewer at the MRQE: ""Shyamalan doesn't conform to the needs of modern movie goer zombies. It doesn't mean he sucks. It means you don't get it. At least someone still takes risks in the ART of cinema. It's not unintentionally hilarious. It's a blatantly comedic satire.""Whoa! That changes everything. Satire gives Shyamalan a free pass from ridiculous straight through to funny; except I'm not sure what he is satirizing. Himself? Message movies? Horror movies? Science? What? Doesn't satire involve an obvious subject in order for the satire to be got? I'm not going to hold the MRQE reviewer to his literal words because if The Happening is ""blatantly comedic"" I have lost my sense of humor completely. There is the part with the greenhouse guru--who pretty much solves the mystery of the Event by declaring that plants, because they can't run around and throw punches, develop neurotoxins to fight off threats to their existence--and his ironic enthusiasm for bringing hot dogs along on the getaway trip. That was funny. When he asks Mark Wahlberg and then Zooey Deschanel if they like hot dogs, they both respond negatively, but not so much as in ""No, they give me the creeps"", but more like ""Not really, but more importantly your enthusiasm for them is giving me the willies.""Satire can also bring forgiveness to plot wonders and plot holes. One of the more uncomfortable moments in the film for me is when John Leguizamo decides to turn back and go into the dead zone to look for his wife. He is about to entrust his daughter's safety to Mark and Zooey but when Zooey reaches out to take his daughter's hand John barks at her: ""Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it."" On paper the line is in character, perhaps, but in performance it's way out of line. Are we supposed to laugh at the pain in Zooey's eyes as she reacts to this idiotic ungratefulness? I dunno. I don't get it. Shyamalan could very well be forging a new path, creating his own rules for satire, or deconstructing it and tossing aside certain aspects, like humor, for the sake of his art.There's the famous bit of dialog from the movie trailer where Wahlberg confronts the getaway train conductor (or whatever he is) about why they can't get back on the train and keep going. The conductor says, ""We've lost contact."" Wahlberg asks, ""With who?"" and the conductor replies ""Everyone."" That seems pretty final until a few scenes later where a woman is talking on her cell phone to her daughter who's back in the infected zone. Mark walks up like Jack from the TV show Lost and offers instructions to pass along to the daughter of the hysterical woman who puts the call on speaker-phone so we can all hear her daughter die. Cut. There's the scene where someone whips out an iPhone and plays a high quality video that was just sent to them from someone in the infected zone. I'm not going to tell what the video shows, suffice to say it's blatantly comedic. As is the notion of running away from the wind but I'm not bringing that up.I have an extremely high tolerance for the gravity of plot as it weighs on a story. I'm not deducting points for inconsistency; I'm deducting points because so many of the scenes are played so badly. And the story is stupid. Yes, playing the satire card shines a new light on everything but I'm not sure it makes anything more attractive. I'm reminded of a Seinfeld episode where an elderly couple are admiring a giant portrait of Kramer and the guy says something to the effect of ""It's obscene. I can't turn away."" Honestly, that's how I feel about The Happening. It's so bad it has to be brilliant. But blatantly comedic? I'm not so sure. Your mileage may vary.",2,It's obscene.

However I was once again fooled and subjected myself to another 90 minutes with a pretentiously moralistic ending. The supernatural high gloss thriller one might expect borders on B-movie qualities, and this is not meant as a compliment.As others have mentioned, the acting is quite terrible, but then again I have a hard time figuring out whether Zoey Dechanel for instance is acting badly or whether the lines she has are just terribly written. Possibly both?Clearly this film could have done without the violence as all of M.N.Shymalan's other films have. Please note that the film posters had a big red R plastered on them and sure enough, every leading actor made sure to emphasize the R rating on every late night interview they appeared on.

Any thriller on topic of ghosts or supernatural events or Schizophrenia or anything you'd find in a thriller (Even Untraceable, which was a good movie) would have AT LEAST a BIT of inspiration of The Sixth Sense. And lo and behold, the ugly stepsister from the same director: The Happening. OK, so, M. Night Shyamalan has directed TSS, Unbreakable, Signs (which I thought was OK but slightly disappointing), The Village (Awful movie), Lady in the Water, and now The Happening.Judging from what you see in the beginning of the movie, something strange is happening- a bunch of people commiting suicide in gruesome and depressing ways. The film evolves into a drama about a family being hit by the same situation. they get evacuated and board a train, and they find out that they have to walk to escape. They soon find out that a Toxin has been released, causing these people to kill themselves.OK, so, the storyline is interesting, yes. But then the whole ""family drama"" part is where the fil starts to take a downhill slide. None of us know much about these people, and they aren't developed enough. We can't see why we should respect these characters or hope they'll survive. It's just like any other disaster film.I may be a little generous to give it 3 stars but let me tell you why- You know M. Night Shyamalan tried. He stopped trying to create the most shocking twist ending, and he put forth a cool storyline. The death scenes are pretty cool- very gory and disturbing. The lawnmower scene is pretty gnarly, the arm ripping off scene is a big ""WHOA"" moment, and the ""Hairpin"" scene is what sets the disturbing bang for the movie.So if you can give this movie credit for what it tried, you may enjoy it.

From the beginning the only thing about this movie that appealed to me was the presence of the eternally cute and sexy Zooey Deschanel, but she alone can't save it. In fact her and Mark Wahlberg give some of the worst performances of their careers here. M. Night just copies the look and feel of Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' in telling the story of an airborne toxin found in plants and being spread by the wind that sends families fleeing and packs of people banding together and looking for shelter. Wahlberg is a science teacher, Deschanel his wife, and John Leguizamo does nice work as Wahlberg's statistic spouting friend. Leguizamo gives the best performance out of everyone as a concerned dad trying to locate his wife and reunite her with their daughter. At first it seemed like kind of a fun variation on 50's B movies in which some horrible, unknown virus or disease was spreading and eccentric scientists took to the airwaves to warn concerned citizens but it's not.

He's trying to cudgel his class into thinking why the honey bees have begun to disappear.  In walks the Vice Principal.  Class is dismissed.  It seems that everywhere people are being struck with some kind of condition where they are disoriented and kill themselves.Elliot and his best friend Julian (Spencer Breslin) have a few moments of guessing what's happening.  Then, the flight begins.  The problem is, there really is no place to run on the Eastern Seaboard.  Elliot and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) end up with custody of Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) when Julian leaves to find his wife who's taken an alternate route from the city.The question is--will the three survive?  For that matter, will Elliot and Alma even be able to hang together through this?What I was hoping for was an interesting bunch of suppositions and maybe even a solution from our science and math teachers.  Unfortunately, I didn't get it.  What I got instead was a series of successively bloody and gory suicides with no real answer.  The science and math guys really just didn't 'pay off' in this plot.By the end of the film, both my companion and I agreed ""The Happening"" just wasn't happening for either of us.

Night Shyamalan's ""The Happening"" can't help but feel like a straggler to a party that`s already begun winding down.  In this case, the apocalyptic horseman comes in the form of a strange natural phenomenon which causes people to engage in mass suicides.  The usually reliable - but here way too over-earnest - Mark Wahlberg plays a high school science teacher who flees with his wife and the daughter of a friend from their home in New York City (where the plague begins) to a remote area of western Pennsylvania.As always, Shyamalan relies on subtlety and indirection rather than explicit violence and over-the-top special effects to achieve his thrills.  Yet, while there is a certain undeniable creepiness to some of the film, ""The Happening"" ultimately comes a cropper through annoying performances, lackluster storytelling, dopey dialogue and more laugh-out-loud moments than any ostensibly serious horror film should ever have to put up with.  It also doesn't help that ""The Happening"" feels like so many other recent movies that have come before it (""War of the Worlds,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""Cloverfield,"" the ""28 Day"" series etc.) or that it pales in comparison to the much livelier, intentionally funny ""The Signal"" (albeit, in that film, the afflicted individuals were killing other people rather than themselves, making them a bit more of an actual threat).As seems to be the case with Shyamalan's most recent output, one winds up admiring ""The Happening"" much more than one likes it.",2,not much happening here,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",2009,1583,"['**1/2End-of-the-world', 'scenarios', 'have', 'become', 'cottage', 'industry', 'recent', 'years', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'Happening', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'straggler', 'party', 's', 'already', 'begun', 'winding', 'down', 'case', 'apocalyptic', 'horseman', 'form', 'strange', 'natural', 'phenomenon', 'people', 'engage', 'mass', 'suicides', 'usually', 'reliable', 'here', 'way', 'too', 'over-earnest', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'high', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'who', 'wife', 'daughter', 'friend', 'home', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'plague', 'remote', 'area', 'western', 'Pennsylvania.As', 'always', 'Shyamalan', 'subtlety', 'indirection', 'rather', 'explicit', 'violence', 'over-the-top', 'special', 'effects', 'achieve', 'thrills', 'certain', 'undeniable', 'creepiness', 'film', 'Happening', 'ultimately', 'cropper', 'annoying', 'performances', 'lackluster', 'storytelling', 'dopey', 'dialogue', 'more', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'ostensibly', 'serious', 'horror', 'film', 'should', 'ever', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'also', ""n't"", 'help', 'Happening', 'feels', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'recent', 'movies', 'have', 'come', 'War', 'Worlds', 'Am', 'Legend', 'Cloverfield', '28', 'Day', 'series', 'etc', 'comparison', 'much', 'livelier', 'intentionally', 'funny', 'Signal', 'film', 'afflicted', 'individuals', 'were', 'killing', 'other', 'people', 'rather', 'making', 'bit', 'more', 'actual', 'threat', '.As', 'be', 'case', 'Shyamalan', 'most', 'recent', 'output', 'one', 'up', 'admiring', 'Happening', 'much', 'more', 'one']",N/A

Enter School Science Teacher played by Mark Wahlberg. He and his family and friends flee the city, hoping to escape. Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any escape from the biological weapon which kills without warning.I knew the film was going to be bad the moment the one girl removed a long hair stick and impaled herself with it. I thought to myself, please tell me this is not going to be a guts and gore film. Unfortunately, it does appear to be the case. Gore won out over the big mystery of 'what was happening' to the citizens, and from there, it just sort of escalated. The mystery was lost, as we are treated to about a dozen senseless suicides, which were meant to underscore the seriousness of the biological weapon, but instead gave the film a really silly slasher quality.Mark's character Elliot and John Leguizamo's character were about the only characters I cared about. I could not stand Zooey Deschanel's acting and her droopy character, and Julian's kid just added nothing to the screenplay, except a tagalong and an excuse for Elliot and Alma to not get the heck out of Dodge as quickly as possible.Overall, I was disappointed in this film. I am accustomed to rather clever films from Shyamalan, and this film just seemed to lack direction, and be rather obvious.

I want to be shocked, teased, appalled, even made angry at going ons on film.  I want the director's and screenwriters that I watch to have original and yes even WAY out there ideas.  I'm just a guy from N.C. that works as a chef.  I am in no way a film critic, I'm not a director with years of experiance and a gifted and expansive imagination.  So, I tire of people bashing films that are out of the norm, or ""crazy"" just because it's ""not what's expected"" for that genre of film.I adore M. Night, his films ALL OF THEM...from Sixth Sense to the beautiful adult fairy tale of Lady in the Water. (which I personally think was one of his best films...go ahead and hit me, that film was original, well acted and yes, dare I say; DIFFERENT.) So I knew I would love this film. And...I did.Mark Wahlberg did a wonderful job playing a more toned down, less action heavy character.  Zooey Deschanel is so beautiful, and although she was a bit monotone with her vocal acting her doe like eyes conveyed so much.  The premise was great!  The unexplained suicides were interesting and shocking at times (the Lawn mower, ewwh.) I enjoyed the twist as well. (which i won't give away here.)It seems to me, the majority of moviegoers who see the M. Night name above a movie, expect it to be as pitch perfect as The Sixth Sense.  He's a director, he's supposed to do different things.  No one should stay in the ghost story, jump scares, HUGE plot twist style that started their career. That's why they have a career. To grow and do new and wildly different things.So please, all those haters who bash this film. Why don't you try it.

I hate to start any review with this kind of sentiment, but there's no getting away from how bad this film is.The original premise seemed pretty promising, I.e. the worlds plants feeling threatened by the encroaching human population, so it releases a neurotoxin that induces people to commit suicide, but the execution of this idea is dire.The writing is simply terrible, with poor story development, lack of full explanation and unnatural dialogue. The acting is terrible, with cringe making wooden performances, Zooey Deschanel is especially bad, when I`ve seen her act so well in the past. The direction is terrible, with inaccuracies (such as someone shooting themselves with a gun and then the camera pans forwards to see the gun metres in front of the person) and annoying full face to camera angles. The plot started off by being intriguing, but the ending is so lack lustre it leaves you feeling severely let down, there isn't even the clich&eacute; M. Night Shyamalan twist ending to even partially redeem this film.What more can I say? I think my glut of the use of the word terrible pretty much sums up my thoughts on this film.

1184006,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B001DZOC3W,S. Rhodes,"[15, 24]","M. Night Shayamalan started to rise once he directed The Sixth Sense.  While Unbreakable didn't hit high at the Box Office, it was still a fairly good movie.  Signs, on the other hand, was box office gold.  Once he directed The Village, however, he began on a slippery slope by giving us a twist that ruined what otherwise should've been a good movie.  Then we got the convoluted and strange Lady in the Water.  ""The Happening,"" was supposed to be M. Night's return.  A comeback movie.  Instead of being a comeback movie, however, it turns out to be quite possibly the worst movie M. Night has ever done.The Happening begins very simply, and quite morbidly.  In the opening scenes we're treated to death and mayhem as a series of construction workers kill themselves by hurdling off the top of a building.  It's actually quite bloody.  Although, you probably won't believe any of the extras at the beginning are shocked or disturbed by it.What could be causing this catastrophe?  Is it a terrorist attack?  At first there's only speculation.  When more breakouts happen, it becomes clear what has to happen, the characters need to get out of the northeast.  Mark Wahlberg plays a science teacher who can only speculate while John Leguizamo plays his best friend and Zooey Deschanel plays as Mark Wahlberg's wife.It's when a supporting character (whose name you don't really learn but he's played by Frank Collison) finally offers the suggestion that its the plants releasing toxins and making people kill themselves that M. Night jumps the shark.  How this supporting character knows its the plants releasing toxins is never really explained.  He just... knows.  It brings up the obvious question: If the plants can release toxins that make people kill themselves... why not just release toxins that kill the humans?The biggest problem with the movie is that it takes itself too seriously.  The premise of trees releasing toxins to make human beings kill themselves is already an absurd premise, but it's made more absurd with how serious the characters take it.  And they all run around as though they don't really even want to be in the movie.  As if the premise wasn't enough, when the characters discover the wind carries the toxin they try to outrun the wind.The biggest letdown is the ending.  There's no closure.  The event simply ends, but there's no explanation as to why it ends.  The movie builds, but there's no resolution whatsoever.I rarely like to describe a movie as just dumb.  But The Happening was just that... dumb.  The theme of mother nature taking revenge isn't such a bad idea for a movie, but the execution here is absurd and downright implausible.  Certainly it is a movie, but if something like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull can come off as something believable despite its fantasy, it shouldn't be that hard for a movie that was clearly meant to be down to earth like The Happening.If anything works for The Happening it would be that there is a creepy old woman (though she has almost nothing to do with the movie at all) and the music score which manages to be chilling and haunting.  On the whole, however, the movie is incredibly absurd.  Even when suspending your reality, The Happening is just hard to sit through.  It isn't a long movie, but it certainly feels like it.  This is probably the worst movie M. Night has done.  It'll take a lot to come back from this one.",1,M.

1184007,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B001DZOC3W,S. Schell,"[82, 110]","Someone save M. Night Shymalan from himself.  For a man who insists on writing, producing and directing his own movies, he's digging an early grave for his career as a filmmaker and ""The Happening"" has breached the six-foot mark for his burial.  Sporting a lousy script and lousy performances to boot, Shyamalan's much talked-about first R-rated film is a travesty of filmmaking that deserves no better than a 30% rating.  If it were a tomato, it'd be pretty darn rotten.The film begins in the early morning hours in Central Park.  People are milling about, casually strolling, going about their business.  Two young women sit on a bench chit-chatting when one of them hears a shrill scream and turns her head in the direction of the sound.  What she begins to see after a moderate breeze blows through are people suddenly frozen in their tracks, still as statues, an act that mirrors that of a real-life coordinated event once performed in NY's own Grand Central Station (and I have to wonder whether the film was somehow conceived from that).  As she turns to her friend Claire to tell her what she sees, her friend begins mumbling incoherently and slowly removes the hairpick from her tightly wound chignon, deliberately stabbing herself in the neck.From there, we are taken to a construction site three blocks away at 8:39 am, only six minutes into the future from the strange occurrence at Central Park.  A body drops from a fatal height and several foremen rush to his aid, only to witness several more men fall to their death.  We are then scooted along to a small high school in Pennsylvania where science teacher Elliott Moore (Wahlberg) is giving an animated lecture at 9:45 am.  He is suddenly pulled aside by the school principal and taken to a room where the entire faculty hears of the strange events in New York.  The American media assumes at first it is some sort of biochemical terrorist attack, due to the fact that only major cities are being targeted while small towns remain safe.  This theory is quickly busted when small towns suddenly fall prey, the safe zones growing smaller and smaller as Elliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel) and fellow teacher and close friend Julian (Leguizamo) try to find a haven from this unseen and presumably unstoppable force.""The Happening"" glows with promise in its first ten minutes but withers quickly after, leading its audience into a deep dark abyss of disappointment.  At a tight 1 hour and 30 minutes, the film is still agonizingly long, what with its laughable scientific theories and hackneyed performances.  Wahlberg and Deschanel embarrass themselves time and time again, but I have to wonder whether it's really their fault.  Is it due to Shyamalan's joke of a screenplay or his poor direction?

This is one of those films you either have an appreciation for OR it will really make you hate the director all over again.  Either way, it's worth a look!  The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and on Blu-Ray it's top notch.  What a picture!  The clarity of the trees blowing in the wind and the atmospheric dread M. Night displays in this is really something to behold.  James Newton Howard's score is also something noteworthy.  Very moody, dark, miserable and looming.  Subtle and sublime in some areas and downright horrifying in others, ""The Happening"" puts you in a situation where you really contemplate how you would react in a situation like this.  It makes me laugh when someone judges the ""acting"" in this film because the characters are made to play like this is ""real life,"" not acting.  This movie isn't aiming for acting awards.

His terse, gripping and firm delivery in this Horror Apocalypse, cast him as a would-be Charlton Heston in the end-of-the-world, Omega Man style thriller that is pretty frightening at times and intensely nerve racking and thoroughly engaging.No other filmmaker has even dared to handle such subject matter so vividly as Night handles Suicide and Mass Suicide here. This is a film that is honestly devoid of all hope, keeps the audience guessing and paralyzed in fear and does its best to plant a foot in the `Chaos' style of film-making. `Choas', being that the enemy is something unseen, unstoppable by ordinary means, fast spreading and usually unconventional. Films that have really pushed the envelope on this have been the aforementionedThe Omega Man,The Andromeda Strain,Ghosts of Mars,The Martian Chronicles,28 Days Later,28 Weeks Later,The Mistand (possibly)Cloverfield.This film delivers an intensely eerie image of the would-be future and does its best to scare you from your seat with spine chills that stay with you after the movie has ended and haunt you well into the next day.I would say, that this film, is easily a step in a new direction for Night, and all his detractors are like the fanatics that pursue Michael Moore; some people will never be satisfied no matter what happens. I wouldn't listen to the negative reviews on this film, as it's not intended to be something for mass audiences or kids going out on a date movie. I will say that you can bet that this will sell very well when released on DVD in the future, and will be watched for a long time to come.Some people were hoping for him to bestThe Sixth Sense, which I don't get, as any movie goer shouldn't carry those kinds of expectations into any film, but he does give you a film that is well worth the price of admission or the cost of the disk.

O'Blenis,"[7, 11]","The sudden appearance of a never-before encountered disorder in the Northeastern United States - which moves swiftly through its stages to its final phase of causing the seemingly oblivious infected to take their own lives - launches The Happening.  The apocalypse has apparantly arrived in a most unexpected fashion, and it's jolting and eerily believable.  A small group of people tries to figure out what's going on and try and avoid the inevitable of becoming afflicted, as the menace quickly spreads from its point-of-origin and threatens to take on global proportions.When I first saw this one, I was under the impression that the nature of the phenomenon was going to remain a big secret until the end but that wasn't the case or the intention, and the general apparant cause of all the strange events comes out pretty quickly.  I still hesitate to give it away because it IS more effective if you go into it without too much foreknowledge the first time.  I will say that with the way the filmmakers executed it; with the citing of real-life similar phenomenon on a much smaller scale; with the drawing of attention to the fact that there's still much more about the world and the universe that humanity doesn't know than it does; and with a general projection of a sense of wonder about the mystery and grandeur of the cosmos, or nature or existance or whatever you want to call it, it makes the bizarre scenario feel real, and not far-fetched or contrived.  The interactions between the characters, including ones who are total strangers when the events begin, are powerful and engaging.  Many apocaltptic movies do well focusing on the darker aspects of people emerging in the shadow of The End, but The Happening follows a different route and focuses mostly on brighter, more benevolent instincts taking over.  There's one particularly poignant moment near the very end, which may actually involve more participants than it appears.All in all, a riveting, frightening, powerful movie that defies easy classification.

Every once in awhile I do an in-store sampling (random customers watch the films on the HD display and give feedback) prior to release to see how the release might fare (big mistake with this one).Out of 136 customers who filtered through last night whilst displaying the movie, 100 said they will not be renting or buying it now, 25 outright walked away laughing and several kids liked it. Needless to say, this movie was very disappointing. The lead performances, storyline, special effects, and writing were all sadly poor and subpar. Those stories I heard about in theaters of people laughing when the movie had meant to scare you or make you feel sad rang true here too. What I did notice was an unplanned target audience materialized - 12 to 14 year olds. Each kid liked it due to either the corny scare factor or the fake gore. Seven or eight 15-16 year olds walked through that had already seen it and all stated the movie sucked.So anyway, technically the BD has some nice offerings. All the featurettes and extra tidbits are as they are listed here, and most are in 1080. The trivia track actually turned out to be boring on the facts, but it does allow you to incorporate all of the extra features on the disc while watching the film. The deleted scenes were mercifully removed as they were atrocious, and as MNS admitted in the intros to them - they detracted from the film he had wanted people to see - especially all the extra gore. One thing on this BD I had not seen before was the ability to mute the main menu music (if left idling). The wind effects sound great on the DTS HD, and the transfer looked flawless; so much so that the CGI effects looked really bad.I can see why this movie fared poorly, and I know ZD and Marky Mark are way better actors than they show here. The best summary I can come up with is: that volumes of people kept laughing as they listened to the film (while shopping in the store); Mostly due to how corny all the acting/lines/character interaction sounded, let alone how bad it looked while watching it.

The premise of the film, about the Earth's vegetation putting out a toxic chemical to kill humans as a defense against man's abuses on the planet, is actually good. However, it has one glaring plot hole: How can the chemical cause a man or woman to kill themselves? This is the one hole that undermines the movie.However, the character story is terrific, and the acting is great.

I went into this film with both high hopes as the trailers looked very good and it looked like Shyamalan had again found his footing, but I was also prepared for some disappointment feeling that he had reached his personal zenith some time ago (even considering how young he is).Spoiler Alert (well . . . not so much):Many reviewers on here have already spoiled (without warning as such) the basic premise for the film, so there isn't much to spoil with this film and, in fact, there isn't much mystery to this film anyhow unlike other Shyamalan films well-known for their clever plot twists to which there are none here.  In short, the film is about people in the northeast who suddenly take it upon themselves to commit suicide for no apparent reason (at first).  The opening to this film is highly memorable and EXTREMELY disturbing.  It is one of the reasons I gave this film a better rating than some in spite of its obvious and annoying flaws.  The opening is the stuff in which nightmares are made.The film focuses on two teachers nicely played by Mark Wahlberg and John Laguizamo who attempt top get out of New York before they too get hit with whatever is causing these mass suicides.  Laguizamo's character is accompanied by his daughter and expects to meet up with his wife elsewhere and Wahlberg's character is accompanied by his cold and distant wife, excellently played by Zooey Deschannel (sister to Emily best known asBoneson TV).  She is a spitting image of her sister and is a terrific actress in her own right and this performance solidifies that perception.There really isn't much more to this film than these people trying to out run this ""happening"" while also trying to understand why it is happening.  Suspense is somewhat lacking because there isn't anything to see.  What is ""chasing"" them is invisible because it is in the air.  This film is a short 90 minutes in which the first 30 are haunting and highly memorable, but unfortunately followed up by a rather dull 60 minutes that is only highlighted or punctuated with a few shocking and unexpected moments.  Granted that they are powerful moments, but they don't help to really carry the film.  Sadly, while Wahlberg and Laguizamo are good here, they are never much more than that.  They, for whatever reason, don't solicit as much pity from us as their characters or situation would seem to dictate.The film has, in my view, a VERY unforgivable resolution that leaves one with a ""that's it?"" feeling and, unfortunately, our last thoughts coming out of the theater are the ones we typically relay to others.  I purposely waited to write this review until I kind of let the whole film sink in.  I didn't want to say it was great just because of a super opening sequence or that it was terrible due to a ho-hum conclusion to it all.  I think this film will garner a lot of mixed reviews because of the flaws it contains.It is too wide ranging as it goes from disturbing and memorable to silly and no big deal.  Movies like this tend to disappear fairly quickly, but it may be just enough to offer Shyamalan a fighting chance to make another film, but I think he needs to stop being so compulsive about the film being ALL him.  I'd like to see him direct something completely written and produced by someone else with him only directing.  I greatly admire his style and vision, but his ""it's all about me"" approach is wearing his fan base thin.  He writes well and has terrific ideas, but another party to them could improve them or catch and correct the flaws, but Shyamalan has to be more open about his approach to his work.Hits:1) Opening sequence of mass suicides it stay with you long after the film is over.  They are NOT overly graphic by any means, but that doesn't mean that they aren't haunting images.  The bodies hitting the ground after leaping from buildings was not unlike my memories of 9/11.  I recall the live sound bites of people hitting the ground outside the command posts has heard inside the WTC.  I had horrific flashbacks.  I think many will.2) While the basic plot/idea of the film is a bit silly and hard to swallow, the script by Shyamalan offers mostly believable diaglogue that had some good humor from time to time.  It all goes down easy enough.3) No grand special effects (I personally tire of these as Hollywood does everything to overkill status much of the time).4) Nice performances by the cast overall.  No over-the-top nonsense.  Zooey Deschannel is outstanding (okay, she unique eye-candy too with her elegant, but unusual looks).  In addition, Betty Buckley, formally the mom on the old ABC showEight Is Enoughand famous for being in the original Broadway production of ""Cats"" singing ""Memory, gives a bizarre, but memorable performance later in the film.5) Numerous scenes of good suspense and downright shockingly unexpected moments.6) Chalk up another nice haunting and powerful score by James Newton Howard who has scored Shyamalan's other films.Misses:1) The film is VERY uneven with a great opening, ho-hum middle only briefly punctuated with shocking and unexpected moments, and a very poor ending.  This film seriously needed someone on the outside looking in to make or suggest improvements (something Shyamalan is loathe to accept).2) A cast that while okay in their performances, somehow don't solicit the pity we should have for them.  I'm not sure why this is for me, but it really bothered me throughout the film.3) Not much really happens in ""The Happening.""  I know that sounds like some kind of oxymoron, but it's true.  Other than the memorable opening segment, much of the film is the group trying to stay ahead of the ""infected"" areas and the invisible force against them.  There just isn't a lot actually happening in ""The Happening.""  It's a bit hard to get excited about being chased by something you can't see (sound very B horror movie, doesn't it?).Okay, I know you can count and see there are more hits than misses and are wondering why the 3 stars (I'd actually give it 3.5) which means the film is ""good"", but the problems noted in the misses are rather huge for a 90 minute film.  They stand out like neon signs.  Perhaps in a longer film they would be less of an issue and be more forgivable in light of the things that work well, but here they are in your face as glaring problems.  Still, I liked this movie, but I've always like movies with more haunting images than gory ones and this film has more than its fair share of those.06/16/08,Steve Hedge",3,"What's Happening?

1184016,A26WOS0QSDPQ2I,B001DZOC3W,Steven J. Rickard,"[3, 5]","As so many other reviewers have pointed out, Shyamalan's brilliant ""Sixth Sense"" was enough incentive for me to have continued to watch his movies, even as they've gotten steadily worse. I thought ""Unbreakable"" was pretty good, really enjoyed ""Signs,"" and got some enjoyment from ""The Village."" I had a hard time believing that ""Lady in the Water"" could be as bad as the critics were saying, but yeah, it was that bad.After paying to see that stinker, I decided to believe the reviews for ""The Happening,"" but I still hoped it would at least be somewhat enjoyable if I watched it with low expectations. As soon as the DVD was released, I ordered a copy from my local library and was disappointed to find that it was every bit as bad as I'd been warned.I have no problem with the concept of this movie. I think if it had been handled with a little finesse, it could've been enjoyable. But: the dialog and plotting were so incredibly, amazingly awful that I watched the film with a genuine feeling of embarrassment for Shyamalan. I felt sorry for the actors who had to try to perform that clunker of a script with some kind of skill. I'm sure they were all very well paid, but if they take any pride at all in their craft, that had to hurt.I lost a lot of respect for Shyamalan after this film. Is he really so egotistical that he couldn't stand to have someone help him with the script? I guess that question answers itself.If you're like me, you'll probably see the movie despite the poor reviews. Do yourself a favor: reserve a copy at your local library (don't worry, no one else will have it on hold), and be sure to have something to do while the movie is playing. Perhaps you can shell some fava beans, or sort your tax receipts. You'll be glad you've done something to redeem the time you spent watching this movie.",1,"Well, I can't say I wasn't warned...",1243987200,"06 3, 2009",2009,1821,"['so', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'Shyamalan', 'brilliant', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'was', 'enough', 'incentive', 'have', 'continued', 'watch', 'movies', 'even', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'steadily', 'worse', 'thought', 'Unbreakable', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Signs', 'got', 'enjoyment', 'Village', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'believing', 'Lady', 'Water', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'critics', 'were', 'saying', 'yeah', 'was', 'bad.After', 'paying', 'see', 'stinker', 'decided', 'believe', 'reviews', 'Happening', 'still', 'hoped', 'would', 'least', 'be', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'watched', 'low', 'expectations', 'As', 'soon', 'DVD', 'was', 'released', 'ordered', 'copy', 'local', 'library', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'was', 'bit', 'as', 'bad', ""'d"", 'been', 'have', 'problem', 'concept', 'movie', 'think', 'had', 'been', 'handled', 'little', 'finesse', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enjoyable', 'dialog', 'plotting', 'were', 'so', 'incredibly', 'amazingly', 'awful', 'watched', 'film', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'embarrassment', 'Shyamalan', 'felt', 'sorry', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'try', 'perform', 'clunker', 'script', 'kind', 'skill', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'paid', 'take', 'pride', 'craft', 'had', 'hurt.I', 'lost', 'lot', 'respect', 'Shyamalan', 'film', 'really', 'so', 'egotistical', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'have', 'someone', 'help', 'script', 'guess', 'question', 'itself.If', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'probably', 'see', 'movie', 'poor', 'reviews', 'Do', 'favor', 'reserve', 'copy', 'local', 'library', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'one', 'else', 'will', 'have', 'hold', 'be', 'sure', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'movie', 'playing', 'Perhaps', 'can', 'shell', 'fava', 'beans', 'sort', 'tax', 'receipts', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'redeem', 'time', 'spent', 'watching', 'movie']",N/A
1184017,AL277B4AQCWBG,B001DZOC3W,Steven Reynolds,"[22, 26]","American cities of the northeast are plagued by an apparent terrorist attack in which people become confused then suicidal - leaping off skyscrapers, shooting themselves, impaling themselves with hairpins. As high-school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his unhappy wife and colleague flee to the country, it becomes evident the threat is more likely environmental. Nature is fighting back, with plants releasing some kind of toxin to defend themselves against the human industrial onslaught...M. Night Shyamalan executes on this charming premise with a deliberate eye to the sci-fi B-movie, both in style and theme, with lashings of gore, a cheesy score, and expository dialogue that at times sounds more like a textbook. Sadly, however, it doesn't entirely work. Shyamalan's no fool. He wouldn't make a B-movie without a specific intention. So what's going on here? Is the substance connected to the style? Does Shyamalan want us to go back to the 1950s? Is he trying to tell us that cities are bad? Is he echoing E. F. Schumacher's cry that ""small is beautiful""? Or is this a response to misplaced moral hysteria around 9/11? Falling bodies around 9.00am on a New York Tuesday certainly stir the echoes. Is he saying there are bigger threats to worry about than a few ideologues in planes; that 9/11, though a tragic event for those involved, is ultimately a miniscule blip compared to our disastrous global environmental trajectory? Or is it simply a musing on the fragility of humankind and the paucity of our knowledge? He'd be right on all counts, of course. But his intention is never clear.As an argument the film isn't very convincing, and as a piece of entertainment it's worse. Shyamalan's core skills as a writer-director seem to have deserted him - there is no suspense, no real drama, no trademark twist, not even any really nice shots (except the chilling iconic beauty of the falling workmen). It offers just a vague kind of discomfort that's regularly undermined by the near-comic suicide scenes. Shyamalan seems creatively paralysed himself. Still, the film's not entirely without merit. Its difference to standard summer fare makes it reasonably engaging for much of its short duration, and the wheels only really fall off when Moore and family let the power of love trump the power of self-preservation with a very convenient outcome.I think Shyamalan's also a victim of his own success - expectations are incredibly high for anything he does. From a young, first-time writer-director, this might be seen as competent Hollywood fare with an eye to tradition. From Shyamalan, it's well below par. Wahlberg is probably the strongest element here. He's regularly undermined by appalling dialogue, but his earnestness is endearing. Knowing where he's come from, as an actor and a person, to see him playing this kind of character in this kind of movie is nice.",2,The Day the 'Night' Stood Still,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,2893,"['American', 'cities', 'northeast', 'are', 'plagued', 'apparent', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'people', 'become', 'confused', 'then', 'suicidal', 'leaping', 'off', 'skyscrapers', 'shooting', 'impaling', 'hairpins', 'high-school', 'science', 'teacher', 'Elliot', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'unhappy', 'wife', 'colleague', 'flee', 'country', 'evident', 'threat', 'more', 'likely', 'environmental', 'Nature', 'fighting', 'back', 'plants', 'releasing', 'kind', 'toxin', 'defend', 'human', 'industrial', 'onslaught', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'charming', 'premise', 'deliberate', 'eye', 'sci-fi', 'B-movie', 'style', 'theme', 'lashings', 'gore', 'cheesy', 'score', 'expository', 'dialogue', 'times', 'sounds', 'more', 'textbook', 'Sadly', 'however', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'work', 'Shyamalan', 'fool', 'would', ""n't"", 'make', 'B-movie', 'specific', 'intention', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'substance', 'connected', 'style', 'Does', 'Shyamalan', 'want', 'go', 'back', '1950s', 'trying', 'tell', 'cities', 'are', 'bad', 'echoing', 'E.', 'F.', 'Schumacher', 'cry', 'small', 'beautiful', 'response', 'misplaced', 'moral', 'hysteria', '9/11', 'Falling', 'bodies', '9.00am', 'New', 'York', 'Tuesday', 'certainly', 'stir', 'echoes', 'saying', 'are', 'bigger', 'threats', 'worry', 'about', 'few', 'ideologues', 'planes', '9/11', 'tragic', 'event', 'involved', 'ultimately', 'miniscule', 'blip', 'compared', 'disastrous', 'global', 'environmental', 'trajectory', 'simply', 'musing', 'fragility', 'humankind', 'paucity', 'knowledge', ""'d"", 'be', 'right', 'counts', 'course', 'intention', 'never', 'clear.As', 'argument', 'film', ""n't"", 'very', 'convincing', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'worse', 'Shyamalan', 'core', 'skills', 'writer-director', 'seem', 'have', 'deserted', 'suspense', 'real', 'drama', 'trademark', 'twist', 'not', 'even', 'really', 'nice', 'shots', 'chilling', 'iconic', 'beauty', 'falling', 'workmen', 'just', 'vague', 'kind', 'discomfort', 'regularly', 'undermined', 'near-comic', 'suicide', 'scenes', 'Shyamalan', 'creatively', 'paralysed', 'Still', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'merit', 'difference', 'standard', 'summer', 'fare', 'reasonably', 'engaging', 'much', 'short', 'duration', 'wheels', 'only', 'really', 'fall', 'off', 'when', 'Moore', 'family', 'let', 'power', 'love', 'trump', 'power', 'self-preservation', 'very', 'convenient', 'outcome.I', 'think', 'Shyamalan', 'also', 'victim', 'own', 'success', 'expectations', 'are', 'incredibly', 'high', 'anything', 'young', 'first-time', 'writer-director', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'competent', 'Hollywood', 'fare', 'eye', 'tradition', 'Shyamalan', 'well', 'par', 'Wahlberg', 'probably', 'strongest', 'element', 'here', 'regularly', 'undermined', 'appalling', 'dialogue', 'earnestness', 'endearing', 'Knowing', 'where', 'come', 'actor', 'person', 'see', 'playing', 'kind', 'character', 'kind', 'movie', 'nice']",N/A

But it has a sort of cheesy, otherworldly aspect to it that makes it an original and creative movie.Is it an environmental film? Yes. Is it a movie about humanity? Yes. Is it science fiction? Hm, not really sure. It does have a ""Twilight Zone"" sort of plot, kind of a moment in time that everything gets turned upside down and no one really knows what's going on.The main beef that I have with this movie is the acting. It's horrendous. If I were in this movie, I'd fit right in, because I've taken acting classes in college, and I'm a horrible actress. But it would have actually worked in this movie. Missed my moment...darn!But I DO like that we and the characters in the movie don't really get any sort of explanation. It made me kind of wonder about what the movie was trying to say to its audience. And that's cool in a way, even with the atrocious acting and weird lines, (""Cheese and crackers"", a soldier says in amazement). The suicide scenes are creative, to say the least. It's not a fun movie, it's filled with all sorts of dismal scenarios that end with death. Some of them are totally disturbing, like the gardeners from Bill's Landscaping hanging by their from garden hoses from trees long after they've died. The way I see it, at least this movie gets some sort of a reaction from people, which is better than total indifference.It's just a bizarre movie and there are some weird sub-plots thrown in for no particular reason other than s*** happens.

1184021,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B001DZOC3W,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[4, 7]","Throughout M. Night Shyamalan's career, the director has always handled the building of suspense with a gifted intuition. In The Happening, the suspense is still present in moderate doses, but his notions of terror just don't complement his attention to buildup. As each of the director's films goes by, his concepts of horror gradually diminish and the psychological thrills are replaced with more generic and less inspired forms of creating scares.A vicious chemical attack occurs in New York City and quickly spreads to neighboring states, causing mass hysteria and countless deaths. Of the few survivors able to get clear of the affected area, science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his troubled wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) must overcome their personal dilemmas to save those whose lives have been entrusted to them.With Shyamalan's clever setups and unique ideas for suspense, resorting to more savage visuals seems below the director's normal methods. Yet The Happening is indeed rated R for violence, though the deaths never really require such visceral exhibitions and don't even utilize the boundaries the rating offers. The film is neither overly bloody nor excessively brutal, and the gore doesn't enhance the scares. In Hitchcock's The Birds, violence was used to complement the terror and a creature certainly not synonymous with horror became a nightmarish purveyor of fear. Shyamalan attempts to copy this strategy with his own unusual villain, but fails to use gore to his advantage and the threat caused never reaches a satisfying level of trepidation.Again the director has filled his cast with notable and mostly wise choices, as Wahlberg easily portrays the quick-thinking science teacher tasked with protecting his makeshift family. Flimsy dialogue can't keep the actor from bringing an engaging character to life, though more development couldn't have hurt. Zooey Deschanel creates an interesting counterpart, though her role never garners the required screen time to flesh out a more complex relationship with her costar. Almost all of the supporting characters stand out but receive such little attention from the camera that their efforts are all but wasted. Both John Leguizamo's Julian and Betty Buckley's infinitely creepy Mrs. Jones never fully realize their potential in the brief amount of time they're given.While several scenes showcase the director's admirable grasp on building suspense, his visions of true fear have become as clouded as The Happening's opening credits. Amping up the film's display of bloodletting to earn an R rating has done little to increase the actual terror committed to the screen, and we're left with what is likely the first ever public service announcement horror film.- Joel Massie",2,The Happening: Movie Review,1213315200,"06 13, 2008",2008,2756,"['Throughout', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'career', 'director', 'always', 'handled', 'building', 'suspense', 'gifted', 'intuition', 'Happening', 'suspense', 'still', 'present', 'moderate', 'doses', 'notions', 'terror', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'complement', 'attention', 'buildup', 'director', 'films', 'concepts', 'horror', 'gradually', 'diminish', 'psychological', 'thrills', 'are', 'replaced', 'more', 'generic', 'less', 'inspired', 'forms', 'creating', 'scares.A', 'vicious', 'chemical', 'attack', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'quickly', 'spreads', 'neighboring', 'states', 'causing', 'mass', 'hysteria', 'countless', 'deaths', 'few', 'survivors', 'able', 'get', 'clear', 'affected', 'area', 'science', 'teacher', 'Elliot', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'troubled', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'must', 'overcome', 'personal', 'dilemmas', 'save', 'lives', 'have', 'been', 'entrusted', 'them.With', 'Shyamalan', 'clever', 'setups', 'unique', 'ideas', 'suspense', 'resorting', 'more', 'savage', 'visuals', 'director', 'normal', 'methods', 'Happening', 'indeed', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'deaths', 'never', 'really', 'require', 'such', 'visceral', 'exhibitions', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'utilize', 'boundaries', 'rating', 'offers', 'film', 'overly', 'bloody', 'excessively', 'brutal', 'gore', ""n't"", 'enhance', 'scares', 'Hitchcock', 'Birds', 'violence', 'was', 'used', 'complement', 'terror', 'creature', 'certainly', 'not', 'synonymous', 'horror', 'became', 'nightmarish', 'purveyor', 'fear', 'Shyamalan', 'copy', 'strategy', 'own', 'unusual', 'villain', 'use', 'gore', 'advantage', 'threat', 'caused', 'never', 'satisfying', 'level', 'trepidation.Again', 'director', 'filled', 'cast', 'notable', 'mostly', 'wise', 'choices', 'Wahlberg', 'easily', 'quick-thinking', 'science', 'teacher', 'tasked', 'protecting', 'makeshift', 'family', 'Flimsy', 'dialogue', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'actor', 'bringing', 'engaging', 'character', 'life', 'more', 'development', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'interesting', 'counterpart', 'role', 'never', 'required', 'screen', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'more', 'complex', 'relationship', 'costar', 'Almost', 'supporting', 'characters', 'stand', 'out', 'receive', 'such', 'little', 'attention', 'camera', 'efforts', 'are', 'wasted', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Julian', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'infinitely', 'creepy', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'never', 'fully', 'realize', 'potential', 'brief', 'amount', 'time', ""'re"", 'given.While', 'several', 'scenes', 'showcase', 'director', 'admirable', 'grasp', 'building', 'suspense', 'visions', 'true', 'fear', 'have', 'become', 'as', 'clouded', 'Happening', 'opening', 'credits', 'Amping', 'up', 'film', 'display', 'bloodletting', 'earn', 'R', 'rating', 'done', 'little', 'increase', 'actual', 'terror', 'committed', 'screen', ""'re"", 'left', 'what', 'likely', 'first', 'ever', 'public', 'service', 'announcement', 'horror', 'film.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",N/A

1184023,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001DZOC3W,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[8, 11]","M. Night Shyamalan is known for his highly atmospheric melodramas with supernatural overtones.  Think ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""The Village,"" and ""Signs.""  The director's newest film, ""The Happening"" -- his first R-rated effort -- bears his trademark creepy moments, mysterious occurrences, shocks, and outright creepiness.One day, in Central Park, masses of people become disoriented, stop dead in their tracks, and walk backwards.  Nearby, at a high-rise construction site, workers plummet to their deaths one after another as they walk off the girders above.  Something very unusual is happening, but no one knows what.  The first guess is a terrorist attack.  After all, it is New York City, and memories of 9/11 are still vivid.High school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is summoned to a meeting of the staff and informed of the happening.  Elliot, wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), colleague and friend Julian (John Leguizamo), and Julian's daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) decide things will be safer outside the city and board a train to Pennsylvania.  As the train makes its way to Philadelphia, cellphone calls to folks on the crowded train reveal that the odd behavior is spreading.  Is it terrorism, radioactive leakage from a nuclear power plant, a freak air-based virus?""The Happening"" plays very much like an episode of the original ""Twilight Zone.""  It has that somber, foreboding quality and draws us in immediately with a sensationally effective opening sequence that is both riveting and shocking.  Shyamalan incorporates a number of reaction shots of individuals observing the devastating behavior of their friends and co-workers, so that we experience the horror through their eyes.  Shyamalan's Everyman is Elliot, who is conveniently a science teacher so that he can cobble together a plausible speculation about what's happening all over the East Coast.Wahlberg does a fine job of being both the average Joe caught in an extraordinary situation and the guy who manages to avoid succumbing to whatever it is that's affecting human beings.  Could this be vegetation -- trees, bushes, plants -- forming chemical defenses against man for decades of polluting the planet?  Some of his conclusions may not be 100-percent accurate, but they're good enough to keep him, Alma, Jess, and a few others they meet along the way alive when others are dying around them in gruesome, self-inflicted ways.The movie has its problems.  From a superb beginning, it bogs down and drags when it should be bristling with suspense.  For its R rating, it is surprisingly timid in its visuals.  We hear, for example, about horrendous things happening in surrounding areas, but seldom see them.  Why?  This isn't a radio play.  It would have been far more effective to show assorted examples of man's fatal disorientation in montage format, thus enhancing the scope and grimness of the unknown outbreak.  Starting with a brutal intensity, ""The Happening"" eases into a road trip to nowhere, as the ranks of the survivors thin and Elliot and a few others seem destined to be the last living humans on earth.Late in the film, Shyamalan introduces the character of Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley), a reclusive eccentric bordering on psychotic.  Her presence in the film is puzzling.  She provides some creepy moments, but they lead to dead ends.  There's nothing wrong with a red herring, but it has to misdirect.  The Mrs. Jones character is simply a curiosity and fails to provide any new information or advance the plot.Shyamalan likes control.  He is credited as writer, director, and one of the film's three producers.  So on his shoulders rests the responsibility of fashioning a complete, effective motion picture, not merely a series of clever episodes.  The film is reminiscent of those 1950's sci-fi films where some prehistoric beast comes to terrorize and destroy a major city and mankind has to organize quickly to destroy it.  The concept worked for over a decade.  ""The Happening"" wants to depart from this formula by making the threat more intangible and thus more frightening.  How can you confront an enemy when you don't know what that enemy is?  A good idea, but two-thirds of the way through we become tired of wondering what the ""thing"" is that is causing people to become suicidal.Shyamalan loves The Big Secret -- a major plot point he withholds from viewers until a crucial, climactic point.  It worked beautifully in ""The Sixth Sense,"" far less effectively in ""Unbreakable.""  ""The Happening"" falls somewhere between these two films in effectiveness.  It needs a wallop of an ending.  Instead, it ends in an anticlimactic whimper.",2,"Great beginning, then it fizzles",1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,4644,"['M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'known', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'melodramas', 'supernatural', 'overtones', 'Think', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Village', 'Signs', 'director', 'newest', 'film', 'Happening', 'first', 'R-rated', 'effort', 'trademark', 'creepy', 'moments', 'mysterious', 'occurrences', 'shocks', 'outright', 'creepiness.One', 'day', 'Central', 'Park', 'people', 'become', 'disoriented', 'stop', 'dead', 'tracks', 'walk', 'backwards', 'Nearby', 'high-rise', 'construction', 'site', 'workers', 'plummet', 'deaths', 'one', 'walk', 'girders', 'Something', 'very', 'unusual', 'happening', 'one', 'what', 'first', 'guess', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'memories', '9/11', 'are', 'still', 'vivid.High', 'school', 'science', 'teacher', 'Elliot', 'Moore', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'summoned', 'meeting', 'staff', 'informed', 'happening', 'Elliot', 'wife', 'Alma', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'colleague', 'friend', 'Julian', 'John', 'Leguizamo', 'Julian', 'daughter', 'Jess', 'Ashlyn', 'Sanchez', 'decide', 'things', 'will', 'be', 'safer', 'city', 'board', 'train', 'Pennsylvania', 'train', 'way', 'Philadelphia', 'cellphone', 'folks', 'crowded', 'train', 'reveal', 'odd', 'behavior', 'spreading', 'terrorism', 'radioactive', 'leakage', 'nuclear', 'power', 'plant', 'freak', 'air-based', 'virus', 'Happening', 'very', 'much', 'episode', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'somber', 'foreboding', 'quality', 'draws', 'immediately', 'sensationally', 'effective', 'opening', 'sequence', 'riveting', 'shocking', 'Shyamalan', 'number', 'reaction', 'shots', 'individuals', 'observing', 'devastating', 'behavior', 'friends', 'co-workers', 'experience', 'horror', 'eyes', 'Shyamalan', 'Everyman', 'Elliot', 'who', 'conveniently', 'science', 'teacher', 'so', 'can', 'cobble', 'together', 'plausible', 'speculation', 'what', 'happening', 'East', 'Coast.Wahlberg', 'fine', 'job', 'being', 'average', 'Joe', 'caught', 'extraordinary', 'situation', 'guy', 'who', 'avoid', 'succumbing', 'whatever', 'affecting', 'human', 'beings', 'Could', 'be', 'vegetation', 'trees', 'bushes', 'plants', 'forming', 'chemical', 'defenses', 'man', 'decades', 'polluting', 'planet', 'conclusions', 'may', 'not', 'be', '100-percent', 'accurate', ""'re"", 'good', 'enough', 'keep', 'Alma', 'Jess', 'few', 'others', 'meet', 'way', 'alive', 'when', 'others', 'are', 'dying', 'gruesome', 'self-inflicted', 'ways.The', 'movie', 'problems', 'superb', 'beginning', 'bogs', 'down', 'drags', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'bristling', 'suspense', 'R', 'rating', 'surprisingly', 'timid', 'visuals', 'hear', 'example', 'about', 'horrendous', 'things', 'happening', 'surrounding', 'areas', 'seldom', 'see', 'Why', ""n't"", 'radio', 'play', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'show', 'assorted', 'examples', 'man', 'fatal', 'disorientation', 'montage', 'format', 'thus', 'enhancing', 'scope', 'grimness', 'unknown', 'outbreak', 'Starting', 'brutal', 'intensity', 'Happening', 'road', 'trip', 'nowhere', 'ranks', 'survivors', 'thin', 'Elliot', 'few', 'others', 'seem', 'destined', 'be', 'last', 'living', 'humans', 'earth.Late', 'film', 'Shyamalan', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'Betty', 'Buckley', 'reclusive', 'eccentric', 'bordering', 'psychotic', 'presence', 'film', 'puzzling', 'creepy', 'moments', 'lead', 'dead', 'ends', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'red', 'herring', 'misdirect', 'Mrs.', 'Jones', 'character', 'simply', 'curiosity', 'provide', 'new', 'information', 'advance', 'plot.Shyamalan', 'control', 'credited', 'writer', 'director', 'one', 'film', 'three', 'producers', 'So', 'shoulders', 'responsibility', 'fashioning', 'complete', 'effective', 'motion', 'picture', 'not', 'merely', 'series', 'clever', 'episodes', 'film', 'reminiscent', '1950', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'where', 'prehistoric', 'beast', 'terrorize', 'destroy', 'major', 'city', 'mankind', 'organize', 'quickly', 'destroy', 'concept', 'worked', 'decade', 'Happening', 'depart', 'formula', 'making', 'threat', 'more', 'intangible', 'thus', 'more', 'frightening', 'How', 'can', 'confront', 'enemy', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'enemy', 'good', 'idea', 'two-thirds', 'way', 'become', 'tired', 'wondering', 'what', 'thing', 'causing', 'people', 'become', 'suicidal.Shyamalan', 'Big', 'Secret', 'major', 'plot', 'point', 'viewers', 'crucial', 'climactic', 'point', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'far', 'less', 'effectively', 'Unbreakable', 'Happening', 'somewhere', 'two', 'films', 'effectiveness', 'wallop', 'ending', 'Instead', 'anticlimactic', 'whimper']",N/A

But what's up with this train wreck?Start's out with great promise, with well filmed New York scenes of unexplained behaviors and suicide in Central Park, and bodies raining from the upper floors of construction projects.  A mysterious force or plague, or invisible foe has slipped in among us.  But then . . .Things morph into a series of bad acting performances, stupid scientific speculation, and ends up awkwardly unresolved.I seriously consider if lead actress Zooey Deschanel wasn't under the influence of some mind altering substance during this filming. (And maybe she began sharing it with the director??).  It is so obvious that I thought her behavior might be part of the story, but, nah . . . it was just BAD ACTING.

1184031,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B001DZOC3W,trashcanman,"[3, 7]","Before i get to the review, allow me some observations about the director's career.  M Night Shyamalan has somehow found himself among the most unfairly criticized of modern filmmakers in spite of the fact that every one of his films are among the most unique, atmospheric, and imaginative out there.  Like Tarantino, it has become fashionable among the too-cool-for-the-room set to bash everything the man does even as they wait in line on opening day for each of his films.  You won't see me tripping over myself to check out the latest Paul Anderson or Uwe Boll joint.  Why continue to follow the career of a hack?  Even the usually even-headed Trey Parker and Matt Stone are guilty of Shyamalan bashing.  The most popular criticism is that his films rely solely on twists.  The truth is that onlyThe Sixth Sensehad a profound twist and most will agree that the film was already compelling up to that point.  Yet both film and director have been branded regardless.  Each film he has made has been nearly unclassifiable and very different from what would be expected of any film genre.  This is called creativity, folks.  It's a shame that people can't be comfortable without having each and every preconception and cliche met.Lady in the Water-while essentially a film about childhood- was really a feature-length taunting of his critics.  Childish?  That was the point.  As a fan of the director's work I really enjoyed that.  Small wonder the reviews were bad; most viewers either didn't understand what they were watching or they were the ones being insulted.  Okay, rant over.  On to M Night Shyamalan's latest.""The Happening"" was a great concept.  Mark Wahlburg plays our protagonist, a hip science teacher who we meet lecturing his students about Einstein's theory that if bees vanished off of the face of the Earth, mankind would die out shortly after.  Right away we are reminded of humanity's susceptibility to nature and inability to fully comprehend it's workings.  Then it ""Happens"".  By now you all know that ""it"" is a wave of mass suicide; one that begins sweeping across New England with frightening speed.  The resulting carnage will leave horror fans drooling for more.  Wahlburg's character gathers up his wife and his best friend (played by a brilliant John Leguizamo) with daughter and flees New York along with the rest of the surviving populace.  Great filmmaking.The deaths in ""The Happening"" are the main draw.  In spite of the advertisements' focus on the fact that this is Shyamalan's first R-rated feature, the director uses impeccable restraint in portraying the violent suicides and keeps the profanity nearly nonexistent.  The killshots are suspensful and teasing, showing enough to shock and disturb you, but never lingering enough to become gruesome.  My favorite suicide involves a man at the zoo entering the lion's cage.  The scene is shown as footage from a handheld camera and the result is jarring and unclear, but certainly violent and gory.  The concept, as always, is a brilliant one; nature evolving to strike back at mankind is truly good stuff.  The first half of this film is outstanding.  Unfortunately, it overstays it's welcome.Now the bad.  Leguizamo is the only worthwhile performance and he is grossly underused.  Wahlburg and his onscreen wife Zooey Deschanel have zero chemistry (though she does have beautiful eyes) and there are more than a few moments where you wonder if the comedic acting is intentional or not.  And the menacing shots of trees are anything but menacing.  Sorry, there is just no way to make a tree shaking in the wind scary unto itself.  And the gimmick of having the victims walk a few steps backwards before offing themselves strikes me as more than a little bit silly.  The stopping dead in their tracks and saying bizarre things was all well and good, but why would they walk backwards?  So goofy.  In spite of the movie's plodding pace, many of the film's concepts are very poorly fleshed-out.  Watching Wahlburg's character put the pieces together is great until Shyamalan apparently decides to throw them out the window for the sake of being mysterious or some such thing.  More could have been done with the mood ring, which comes off as a gimmick to give the characters something to talk about while a whole lot of nothing happens.  Human energy and moods are talked about but never properly integrated into the story's events like they should have been.  Sloppy.  Very sloppy.I hate to become one of Shyamalan's critics, but this was a poorly put together story that would have made an amazing episode ofMasters of Horror, but just was not ready to be a feature length film.  The first half was jaw-dropping at times and extremely promising, but the characters quickly become tiresome and eventually you're left just waiting for the next death scene.  This script needed some serious work and Shyamlan's filmmaking talents could not fully vindicate his poor writing this time around.  But in spite of it's laundry list of shortcomings, ""The Happening"" has some very worthwhile concepts and deaths that make it worth a peek.  Consider this least of m Night Shyamalan's flicks a tentative rental.  Pass if you're not a fan of his work.  Who am I kidding?  Most of those guys ran out and saw it before I did.  2 1/2 stars rounded up for a strong first half.",3,An average flick with great moments,1213660800,"06 17, 2008",2008,5344,"['i', 'get', 'review',

1184034,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001DZOC3W,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 6]","You know M. Night Shyamalan and his films. I think someone has already summarized the career of this once brilliant director so far, so I only add that he made great films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and I still love them. Will he ever going to ""come back"" and make a great film again? His latest film strongly suggests that this is not happening.""The Happening"" is a supernatural thriller that opens in Central Park, New York City. People suddenly start to act strangely and they eventually die in a bizarre way. I don't reveal here how it happens in this R-rated film, but I can say what you will see in the construction site scene is bizarre and eerie, something that reminds us of the director's earlier films. ""The Happening"" certainly starts promisingly.But about 30 or 40 minutes in, it stalls. The story centers on a Philadelphia science teacher played by Mark Wahlberg and his wife Zooey Deschanel. They try to escape to the countryside using a train with his best friend and math teacher played by John Leguizamo and his daughter, but things would not go as planned, as we expected, and they are stranded in a small town where horrifying news arrive. This is where the film stops being interesting. Things happen in a rather haphazard way; characters remain uninteresting or just outrageous, like a Miss Havisham-like old lady, this film's counterpart of Tim Robbins in ""War of the Worlds."" Bad acting from the leading players does not help.But who is really to blame for the incredibly weak and incoherent storyline? Apparently co-producer/writer/director M. Night Shyamalan borrowed sci-fi thriller elements from such masterpieces as ""The Birds."" Borrowing itself is not a bad thing, I know; what makes ""The Happening"" really bad is the way it borrows. Just because ""The Birds"" does not show the true reasons for birds' violent attacks on humans doesn't mean that you can leave the crucial part of the film's plot unexplained AFTER giving us so many hints and clues. Why does IT start in the park? Why does it happen only in the certain area of the United States? The film changes rules more than once as if trying to cover the facts that it actually has no coherent logic behind the random deaths of the people.Mr. Shyamalan did one good thing in ""The Happening,"" though: he stopped acting, restricting his role to a much smaller one, a voice on a cell phone.

1184035,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B001DZOC3W,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[4, 6]","I'm a fan of M. Night Shyamalan.  THE SIXTH SENSE, UNBREAKBLE, and SIGNS are not only entertaining films, but the stories in those films tacks some very deep and important issues, such as love, the nature of evil, and faith.  Even though THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER were not as well received by either audiences are critics, I enjoyed both of them (in fact I loved LADY IN THE WATER--it's a modern-day fairy tale told right).  Therefore, I was quite excited to see THE HAPPENING.  Instead of having some great philosophical discussions with friends and family after seeing the movie (as happened each time before after I saw Shyamalan's films), I left thinking ""What happened?"" and ""That was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.The film begins interesting enough and contains enough shock value to hold one's attention for the first half of the film.  It's just another day in Central Park in NYC.  A woman sits on a bench chatting with a friend when she hears someone scream.  A breeze flows through the park and then everyone stops moving.  Moments later the woman's friend removes a hair pick and begins stabbing herself in the neck in a deliberate act of suicide.  Minutes later at a downtown construction site in the city, a foreman is trying to contact a worker who won't respond when the missing worker's body plunges from the sky.  The event is witnessed by several people, but as they rush to the fallen man's aid other bodies begin falling from the sky as worker after worker walks across platforms and plummet to their deaths.The story then moves from NYC to a small, rural Pennsylvania high school where a high school science teacher, Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) is giving an engaging lecture to his students early in the morning. At this point in the movie, as Mr. Moore pontificated about science, I was reminded of a sci-fi parody I saw a few years ago, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA.  The hero of that movie was a scientist, too and said some of the same phrases (almost word for word) that Mr. Moore spoke.  Of course, THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVRA was a parody film of all of those cheap sci-fi pictures of the 1950s and 1960s and was illustrating at how absurd it was that just because a person was a scientist they could be a credible hero and save the world from its problems.  When a movie that begins so shocking, interesting, and thrilling takes a sudden detour and causes one to remember a hilarious sci-fi parody about ten minutes into the movie, it's not a good sign.As for the rest of the plot, Moore is pulled away from his class by his principal who informs them they are dismissing school for the rest of the day and is told about what has happened in NYC.  Most of the country assumes that what has happened (and continues to happen as the movie progresses) is a biochemical attack begun by terrorists.  Moore isn't convinced and as people begin to migrate to smaller towns to escape the ""fallout"" of whatever weapon was used, it becomes apparent that even small town America isn't safe.  What happened in New York starts happening across the entire U.S. Northeast.  Moore flees with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) and friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and Julian's daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez) as the try to escape the rather large effected area and reach civilization.I really like Zooey Deschanel. I think she's beautiful and is rather talented given decent material. It was almost painful to watch her in THE HAPPENING.  Her lines were terrible, her character had absolutely no personality, and she had zero chemistry with co-star Mark Whalberg.  I'm not a huge fan of Whalberg. He got a huge break early in his acting career because of his huge music stardom and some of the roles he has played he delivered a performance more wooden than a Pinocchio statue.  Still, Whalberg does have some talented and, like Deschanel, when given decent material, e.g. THE DEPARTED and INVINCIBLE, he excels.  THE HAPPENING isn't a movie where he's allowed to display his talents as a performer.  Instead he spends most of the time running around with a scared look on his face and saying lines that even a high-school dropout who hates reading can recognize as bad writing.  Oh, and did I mention he has no chemistry whatsoever with his co-star who is playing his wife, Zooey Deschanel.  Whalberg does a better job of trying to make the best of bad dialogue, but most of the other actors in the movie don't even try.  It's a bad script and other than a few scenes scattered throughout the movie, most of the cast doesn't even seem to be trying.Other than the terrible writing, there's a thing called plot that if very, very weak.  Bascially (SPOILERS AHEAD) the Earth's plants have decided to murder us.  That's it. The plants are the bad guys.  That's right. Plants. Enough said about that.Shyamalan's films have always had a layered subtext that seems more important to him than even the actual films themselves.  His films are full of meaning and are richly rewarding if viewers allow themselves to think about what they are seeing.  I'm sure there is some sort of subtext in THE HAPPENING besides the surface story about nature turning against man because of the destruction we've caused through things like man-made global warming.  The problem is that it's not really decipherable what that message is.  Is the movie really a comment about terror attacks and how paranoid the citizenry becomes in such events? Is it about the fickleness of the masses?  Is it about how reliant we've become upon media and technology so much so that we can no longer think for ourselves?  Or is it more like the surface story, a cautionary tale in the vein of JURASSIC PARK warning us that no matter how scientifically advanced we might think we are, nature will always find a way to outsmart us?  The movie might be trying to make all of these points, but none of it really matters.  In the past, the messages made sense because the movies that Shyamalan made were actually enjoyable to watch.  Even THE VILLAGE and LADY IN THE WATER are good movies if you watch them with a child-like wonder and accept them for what they are.  However, no amount of suspension of disbelief is going to help make THE HAPPENING a good movie.  Whatever message or messages Shyamalan was trying to make become lost and completely overshadowed because the vehicle the message is being delivered in (the movie itself) is so terribly bad.  The only good points are the shocking opening sequence and a few other well-done scenes scattered throughout the movie. And that's all that's happening with THE HAPPENING.",1,What happened with THE HAPPENING?--1 1/2 Stars,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",2008,6613,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'THE', 'SIXTH',

Truthfully, the first 3/4 of the film were actually pretty darn entertaining. There was mystery and tention, just a great buildup. But then, the end happened, or uh, didn't. Simply put; one of worst endings in the history of films. No joke. It was just awful and I was so mad for days after. I felt cheated. There are no words to describe what went wrong, because I have no idea what M Night was thinking when he wrote this script. I'm just so confused. It litereally ruined what could have been a really decent flick.

The only other one that I somewhat enjoyed was ""The Village,"" that though a highly improbable scenario, provides the audience with a good twist at the end.  With ""The Happening"" we enter a new realm of preposterous with a film that is executed so poorly that it borders on the laughable and not in the way that a good b-movie can be.  After pretty exciting opening scenes, the movie grinds to a mind-numbing halt, as quickly, the characters are introduced and they are about as likeable and believable as a snobbish $5.00 streetwalker who just happens to be Nietzsche scholar. Good actors are reduced to uttering ridiculous dialogue and hack their way through some unbelievably stupid scenes, such as Mark Wahlberg telling everyone to try to outrun the wind (can you imagine??) or apologizing to a houseplant for man's offenses only to realize that it's plastic.  I know the latter was meant to provide a moment of levity in a grim predicament, but it's pulled off so ineptly that rather than laughing along with the character, you're merely laughing at the sheer stupidity of it all.  Then there's the scene where the train passengers find themselves stranded in a little town and eating at the local diner. After watching a newscast, panic sets in and everyone takes off in their cars, leaving behind our four principal characters.  One question:  Where did all these train passengers get the cars they left in?  Either a). The car fairy placed one under selected placemats or b). The entire population of the town just happens to be willing to carpool with a bunch of outsiders (as was the case with Leguizamo's character).  There was no pleading on behalf of the passengers for the town folk to allow them to tag along, no terror induced screaming, arguments or fighting.  Everyone just jumped into their respective vehicles and took off like friends with a case of the trots heading home after eating a rancid meal.  Nothing encourages neighborly discourse among strangers like an unseen menace prowling in the vicinity. Zooey Deschanel seemingly had two expressions at her disposal:  Googley eyed and very googley eyed.  Everyone just seems bored and I couldn't wait for it all to come to an end.  I took not an ounce of interest in any of these people.  Far from sympathetic they were irritating and  hour into the flick, I was hoping they'd do themselves in, too.  Maybe Deschanel could have torn her own eyes out.  Lord knows those peepers were willing to meet her halfway or Wahlberg could have bored himself to death by rambling on nonsensically about his trite theories.  I can't quite remember when was the last time I disliked a movie as much as this one, but I guess since I was so looking forward to it only to be rewarded with the most preachy, arrogant and down right annoying piece of celluloid to pass for a film in sometime, I was unwilling to be  forgiving.  This movie is an insult to the film going public and, no doubt, all those involved with this fiasco must be asking themselves...""what the hell was I on when I took on this train wreck of a movie: .Horse tranquilizers and grain alcohol?""  It's hard to believe that this piece of cinematic excrement was created by the same person who produced one of the greatest supernatural thrillers in film history.",1,Sub-par beyond words,1223337600,"10 7, 2008",2008,3364,"['Save', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'care', 'Shyamalan', 'work', 'only', 'other', 'one', 'somewhat', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'Village', 'highly', 'improbable', 'scenario', 'audience', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'Happening', 'enter', 'new', 'realm', 'preposterous', 'film', 'executed', 'so', 'poorly', 'laughable', 'not', 'way', 'good', 'b-movie', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'opening', 'scenes', 'movie', 'mind-numbing', 'halt', 'quickly', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'are', 'likeable', 'believable', 'snobbish', '5.00', 'streetwalker', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'Nietzsche', 'scholar', 'Good', 'actors', 'are', 'reduced', 'uttering', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'hack', 'way', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'such', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'telling', 'everyone', 'try', 'outrun', 'wind', 'can', 'imagine', 'apologizing', 'houseplant', 'man', 'only', 'realize', 'plastic', 'know', 'latter', 'was', 'meant', 'provide', 'moment', 'levity', 'grim', 'predicament', 'pulled', 'off', 'so', 'ineptly', 'rather', 'laughing', 'character', ""'re"", 'merely', 'laughing', 'sheer', 'stupidity', 'Then', 'scene', 'where', 'train', 'passengers', 'find', 'stranded', 'little', 'town', 'eating', 'local', 'diner', 'watching', 'newscast', 'panic', 'sets', 'everyone', 'cars', 'leaving', 'four', 'principal', 'characters', 'One', 'question', 'Where', 'did', 'train', 'passengers', 'get', 'cars', 'left', 'car', 'fairy', 'placed', 'one', 'selected', 'placemats', 'b', 'entire', 'population', 'town', 'just', 'be', 'willing', 'carpool', 'bunch', 'outsiders', 'was', 'case', 'Leguizamo', 'character', 'was', 'pleading', 'behalf', 'passengers', 'town', 'folk', 'allow', 'tag', 'along', 'terror', 'induced', 'screaming', 'arguments', 'fighting', 'Everyone', 'just', 'jumped', 'respective', 'vehicles', 'took', 'off', 'like', 'friends', 'case', 'trots', 'heading', 'home', 'eating', 'rancid', 'meal', 'Nothing', 'neighborly', 'discourse', 'strangers', 'unseen', 'menace', 'prowling', 'vicinity', 'Zooey', 'Deschanel', 'seemingly', 'had', 'two', 'expressions', 'disposal', 'Googley', 'eyed', 'very', 'googley', 'eyed', 'Everyone', 'just', 'bored', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'come', 'end', 'took', 'not', 'ounce', 'interest', 'people', 'Far', 'sympathetic', 'were', 'irritating', 'hour', 'flick', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'do', 'too', 'Maybe', 'Deschanel', 'could', 'have', 'torn', 'own', 'eyes', 'out', 'Lord', 'peepers', 'were', 'willing', 'meet', 'halfway', 'Wahlberg', 'could', 'have', 'bored', 'death', 'rambling', 'nonsensically', 'trite', 'theories', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'remember', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'time', 'disliked', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'one', 'guess', 'was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'only', 'be', 'rewarded', 'most', 'preachy', 'arrogant', 'down', 'right', 'annoying', 'piece', 'celluloid', 'pass', 'film', 'sometime', 'was', 'unwilling', 'be', 'forgiving', 'movie', 'insult', 'film', 'going', 'public', 'doubt', 'involved', 'fiasco', 'must', 'be', 'asking', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'when', 'took', 'train', 'wreck', 'movie', '.Horse', 'tranquilizers', 'grain', 'alcohol', 'hard', 'believe', 'piece', 'cinematic', 'excrement', 'was', 'created', 'same', 'person', 'who', 'produced', 'one', 'greatest', 'supernatural', 'thrillers', 'film', 'history']",N/A
1184047,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001DZOC3W,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[13, 19]","Act of God- A direct and sudden event or action of certain unexplainable forces that could not be reasonably foreseen; it compromises all evidence and defies all attempts at explanation by Science.THE HAPPENING is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's latest outing after his somewhat disappointing ""Lady in the Water"". This director's films are lyrical in tone but often has a darkness in their proceedings; Shyamalan`s films are also thematic in their execution and ""The Happening"" is no different. Pronounced as his first ""R-Rated"" film, this latest offering is as imaginative as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". His films are a ""hit"" or a ""miss"", I'm not a solid fan but his films are certainly original. Certain viewers will probably feel a bit alienated because of its main premise, but no one can deny that the film does explore humanity`s greatest threat: the unknown and the unexplainable.One morning, in a major city in the U.S., everyone seems to be minding their own business, doing their chores, working their shifts, until suddenly, a barrage of unexplainable suicides happen one after the other. Citizens commit violence against themselves and the only explanation the media can offer is a terrorist attack or a deadly toxin released by either terrorists and then plants. Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) is a science teacher who bases most things on deductive reasoning and logical explanations; has to flee the city for the countryside with his wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel) together with a small group of survivors to try to escape the invisible threat. However, what they come across with may defy all semblances of logical human explanation.Shyamalan may have summoned the bleakest array of disturbing images in the film's beginning. The nightmare and mayhem by eventual suicides are thoroughly visible; hairpins are driven to jugulars, construction workers jumping off buildings, cops shooting themselves, people crawling under their own lawnmowers, zoo keepers offering themselves as a the main course to lions. The director offers a lot of truly bleak hysteria and will definitely make your skin crawl. The images are full of intense sequences of mass suicide especially in the first act, which is worthy of the price of a movie ticket by itself. It is dark, moody and bleak that will definitely leave some viewers very affected as it dishes out all the lurid details.The film emulates a very strong feeling of the unknown and further accentuated by the confused media broadcasts which attempt to explain the phenomena. Elliot has his own theories as well as a kindly farmer which he has crossed paths with. There is also a feeling of helplessness as our cast finds themselves fleeing from one path to another, avoiding heavily populated places with large amounts of deaths. Human panic and fear is also explored with a very bleak execution. Some may say that Shyamalan missed some opportunities as the film seems like a rethread of his film, ""Signs"", with a family caught in all the chaos. While this may be so in a way, I do think that ""The Happening"" is a lot more intense with its premise and its ability to unnerve is more omnipresent.Elliot offers some theories of the `event' as Wahlberg makes his best expressions of being puzzled, flabbergasted and confused. This man has been on a roll lately, I liked him in ""Shooter"" and ""The Departed""; Markie-mark pulls off a very decent performance. His supporting cast isn't so bad either. The dialogue still has the usual ""quippy"" remarks as is reminiscent in Shyamalan's ""Signs"" that are also an acceptable practice to tone down its bleakness somehow and to express different personalities in a certain situation. I liked the nice touches by the director as he shows the blowing wind as a harbinger of doom, as if a mighty hand envelopes the surroundings with an irresistible force. The only fault the film may have is that it seemed to run a little out of gas near the final act, as he somehow exhausts his ideas. Don't get me wrong, it's just that it may be near-impossible to keep up such a powerful start.It's impossible for me to say anything more without spoiling the film, the film is a cannon of a horror film in its first act. Complemented with a very bleak tone that stays within a lyrical execution and a good soundtrack, with Wahlberg's confused looks, ""The Happening"" is a satisfying diversion. Its main theme of the unknown promises a change of pace and some viewers may argue that it still followed the same formulas. The film may be somewhat hampered with familiar rethreads of a chase film but it`s overshadowed by what its trying to say. If you're familiar with this director's films; you'll know that he has certain motifs and themes, it's not so much with dealing with answers but asking the answers.The film's climax may disappoint some viewers as the film never does offer any solid answers; which is the whole point. I can just hear them now; so what was the cause? I thought it was quite good for Shyamalan to encourage these questions, but those who like being spoon-fed the details should just stay away. After all, how do you explain an ""ACT OF GOD""?Recommended!

These people are expressing POLITICAL views - even if they don't know it. These same people would hate ""Avatar"" if they understood it. We all know there is significant portion of the population that has convinced themselves they have a ""right"" to destroy nature and poison the world. They claim  the world was created for them! Besides they argue, the world is going to end soon anyways, so who cares? Thats why our economy has hit the skids - these people just don't care what they destroy. Its all about them, its all about satisfying their whims instantly. The idea that you might have to actually THINK about a movie really upsets them. What ( obviously) really enrages them is that the environment - the biosphere - might fight back! Especially it might fight back in a completely effective way, targeted just at humans, and the attack would be so rapid that we would have no defense at all. Yet as all intelligent people know, thats exactly what will happen. Not this way, but thru a pandemic. We have too many people living in densely crowded areas (and no health care). The 1918 flu was amazing as a killer. By the time we recognize a pandemic is happening, it will have spread every where. There will be no medical care, no government assistance - of any kind. Everyone you meet could be the one who passes the killer virus to you - so everyone becomes an lethal enemy! Seen in that way, this movie is a wonderful metaphor. There are lots of subtle lessons - such as the heavily armed survivalists who turn out to be exactly what we all know they are - psychotic killers! And the people who completely isolate themselves (Gee, who does that in our society? Duh!!!) turn out to be completely crazy. The people who survive are going to be the ones who are smart and adaptable - and who love each other, not just themselves. This movie perfectly captures the distress and helplessness of our culture confronted with something they can't possibly fight - and which they created by their own destructiveness. Its not really an action movie - but there is lots of action. The ""suicides"" are very disturbing - VERY. Thats another reason why this film bothers so many people. That same group of people think they are in control of everything all the time ( which is why drugs make them wet their pants!). The idea that they would lose control of their minds ( and god would let it happen - oh my!) is profoundly disturbing. People make light of the idea that the ""wind"" would be scary missed Shylaman's use of the wind in his other films. Re-watch ""The Village."" Wind ( air) will be incredibly scary in a pandemic!
