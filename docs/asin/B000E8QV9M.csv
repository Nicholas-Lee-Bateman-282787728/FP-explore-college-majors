970638,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E8QV9M,A Customer,"[25, 28]","Who knew that someone could do so much while driving his or her car? Ellie Parker (the lovely Naomi Watts) has raised multi-tasking to a new level. None of what she does looks remotely safe so I wouldn't recommend you try what she pulls off so adeptly in her whirlwind drive around the hills and studios of Hollywood for auditions. She talks on the cell phone, eats blue ice cream, and the car is her dressing room as she fixes her hair and makeup, and changes into various costumes.As the mercurial Ellie Parker, Naomi Watts is a real hoot playing her sort of semi-autobiographical self, years before she skyrocketed to fame in David Lynch's MullHolland Drive.  Delightfully displaying her comic talents, Watts plays a frustrated actress thrashing around the low end of the Hollywood food chain. Expanded from actor Scott Coffey's short, Ellie Parker features a few days in the life if Ellie as she struggles to define herself in the City of fame and dreams.We first meet her as she's on her way to audition for a Southern Bell and she's channeling her inner Scarlett for a bored young director named Smash. Of course the audition is just one of a number that morning. Soon after it's completed she jumps into her Honda and drives to the next tryout, singing along to Blondie whilst rehearsing a New Jersey junkie-whore accent.Ellie's personal life is also rather unstable. She's unsure whether she wants to stay with her hunky loser musician boyfriend (Mark Pellegrino). When she meets cute Chris (Coffey), an appealing but flighty alleged cinematographer after a car accident, she indulges in an intermittent flirtation with him. She's also crying on the shoulder of cynical actress pal Sam (Rebecca Rigg) who's both savvier and less principled than her friend - she makes up childhood traumas for their method-acting class.The movie was obviously a labor of love the Ms. Watts and what you see here is probably what you get. She's bawdy, irreverent, and sometimes crude, and also terribly insecure about her talent as an actress. The irony is that she is talented - her track record has since proved it - but the movie's point is that she doesn't yet realize it and she ultimately fails to believe in herself. Effectively skewering the Hollywood scene, Ellie Parker is about an industry where everyone is looking for his or her ten minutes of fame and where no one really knows who he or she is, and there's a real sense of biding time for the big role you haven't yet read for.At ninety minutes the original conceit of the movie tends to wear a bit thin and you can feel the original short slowly being stretched to breaking point, but the film remains surprisingly enjoyable. The industry in-jokes are wicked and mordent and Ellie's emotional exhaustion is fully felt as she wonders whether to just throw in the towel and quit acting for good.Elle Parker ultimately stands as definitive evidence of Watts' formidable comic and dramatic talent and her uncanny ability to transform herself - she reveals a totally unglamorous and vulnerable side that few other A-list actresses would ever allow us to see. At the same time she's imparting insight into the very real struggle of an actor's dedication and ""process.""  In this respect, the film is probably required viewing for just about every other struggling actor in Hollywood.

970640,A1PJZKEZQGREDY,B000E8QV9M,California Dreaming,"[0, 0]","I'm a pretty big fan of Naomi Watts, even though I took a lot of heat for my review of ""The Impossible"" a while back.  (I gave the film 4 stars, which surely isn't bad at all.  But I gave that rating with some severe caveats, and none of those caveats were due to Ms. Watts' acting herself.  They were actually targeted more at the original screenplay, and perhaps the director's interpretation of it, in the sense that I didn't find it completely realistic.  This is very ironic since it was based upon a true story.)And I really liked Ms. Watt's performances in ""The Ring"" films.  The first one was more than scary, while the second one ""went to the well one too many times,"" to risk quoting myself.  And I've liked her in most other films as well.  That being said, this film just wasn't for me.  As a matter of fact, I believe that this film would really work for people that are in the film business -- in particular, actresses or actors -- but doesn't necessarily work for us ""common folk.""  There seems to be a lot of inside jokes that, while I kind of understood them, I would probably have to live through some of the experiences to completely get a good hearty laugh.For full disclosure, I didn't watch the entire film; I turned it off after about halfway.  While I found certain parts amusing, as it seems to take a satirical look at Hollywood and the making of films, I just wasn't mesmerized.  They do show Ms. Watts in various forms of dress -- or rather ""undress,"" as a hint to those of you looking for a skin flick -- and Ms. Watts does use some pretty nasty language.  Now, she didn't write the dialog herself, and I didn't completely hate that dialog since I understand that it was trying to deconstruct screenplays and writers in Hollywood, and how stupid dialog can sometimes be.I would say, ""If you are an actor, this film is for you.

When the two girls start arguing in the ladies' room over which onbe Keanu prefers, you get the cold shivers because it's so much like a scene from David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE, only a MULHOLLAND DRIVE in which someone had thought to cast Keanu Reeves.

970648,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000E8QV9M,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 3]","I thought that ""Ellie Parker"" was a direct to video DVD, but actually it is more a movie that was made directly on digital-video.  It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had some limited release, but this 95-minute film by Scott Coffey was originally a 16-minute short.  It stars Naomi Watts as the title character, an Australian who is struggling to make it in Hollywood as an actress, and clearly she is losing this one as we follow her through a day in her life.  All things considered, this film is sustained by Watts, both as the co-producer of the film and as the star.  Without her, it would not have been made, and chances are without her, it would not be worth watching.Ellie is really an actress.  Not in terms of quality, you understand, but in terms of being an actress all the time.  This does not serve her as well as you would think she goes from one depressing audition to another, but it certainly helps her avoid getting helped in therapy.  When we see her in her acting class we realize that she has embraced ""the method"" so much that she is using her life to help her play an actress who is learning the method.  Ellie Parker is who she appears to be because she does not have a script that tells her how to be somebody else.  Fortunately her best friend, Sam (Rebecca Riggs), makes Ellie look good, and so does her musician boyfriend, so although she has her faults, we can still root for Ellie.  When some guy (Coffey) rear ends her car, adding injury to insult, this is not a good thing.  But the guy turns out to be a cinematographer, so maybe there is an upside to the chance meeting.  However, there is a strong possibility that Ellie is under something of a curse in that she might beUltimately the flaw here is not turning something that was 16 minutes into something that is 95 minutes, but it trying to come up with something that feels like an ending.  It is not the arc of Ellie Parker's character that matters here but how she exists in the world she inhabits.  The short clearly had people thinking they wanted to see more of Ellie Parker, while this version indicates we have seen all there is, which promotes a much different feeling when we fade to black.  I can even point to the moment in the movie when it gets off track: when Chevy Chase shows up as Ellie's agent.

That different look comes from that the movie was ""shot on a Sony DCR PC 100"" as the end credits spell out. But really, that is just one facet of an overall picture that must also include the star, Naomi Watts who gives a superb performance playing a tough job-seeking actress out in L.A. Other superb facets include the script and the camera visuals. This was really like no other film I've seen except for maybe Time Code or Mulholland Drive. Naomi plays Ellie, a actress who we see ferrying about to different auditions, preparing for them, agonizing over them and watching her act in them.We also get to see large chunks of her personal life with her standard issue boyfriend, her also actress best girlfriend and her acting class lorded over by a coke-sniffing instructor.I rate the movie 5 stars because we get to watch Miss Watts exhibiting incredible acting chops and the LOOK of the movie which I must owe to the fabled ""shot on Sony DCR PC 100"" credit.the dialogue is excellent.I could...deduct a star for what I feel is a bit of a inconsequential conclusion but it's all so good up to that point.This movie would also come in very handy for anyone considering a career in acting because the details of what that would be like are all portrayed here very accurately.And I must once again commend Naomi Watts' acting.

This is a video, and has a videotape quality (though good in quality), not a film.  Still, perhaps it was the maker's intentions (or limited budget), and I can't really fault this work for it's non-filmic, direct to video ""look.""Films (or feature length fictional video productions like this) about those out in LaLaLand (LA) trying to ""make it"" in the ""industry,"" have always been around, basically from ""Sunset Boulevard"" to present.  ""The Player"" comes to mind, as well as others, but in the ""video"" mode, I can only think of another more recent ""film"" as good as this, and that would be ""Camp Hollywood,"" which deals with a roach motel just above Hollywood Blvd.  If you liked ""Ellie Parker"" you will love ""Camp Hollywood"" and vica versa.  What makes ""Ellie Parker"" special however can be summed up in two words.  Naomi Watts.Unlike ""Camp Hollywood,"" this film concentrates on the main character first and foremost, and includes a few key supporting roles instead of being an overall, numerous character essay on the struggle for fame and fortune out in Dreamland.  While the supporting characters add a lot here, none come close to Naomi's performance.  Given, she is the main character, and title of this work, but sprinkled throughout are keen insights into this whole LA wannabee subculture.  Having lived it myself for a decade and a half, but behind the camera and at my keyboard, so much of this touches home.""Ellie"" (Naomi) is a beautiful, young actress with a few credits to her name and a lower-class agent, and with a lot of unrecognized, unrewarded talent.  As such, she kind of represents an ""everywoman"" of those 1000's like her, past, present, and future, who come to LA with dreams of making it big.  Trouble is, as I myself found out in tinseltown, ""talent"" is pretty low on qualifications of ""making it"" out there.  ""Ellie"" can obviously act, and in a non-method manner, but she is torn by her own self belief and esteem, is not getting many ""call-backs,"" is losing hope, and has a jerk as a boyfriend/ex-boyfriend, and is surrounded by typical LA wannabees.  All trying to be what they are not.Trouble is, we see from the beginning that ""Ellie"" really does have some amazing acting gifts, and her expertly playing various role characters throughout only add to our immediate sympathy and empathy with her.  But she is frustrated every step along the way.  Naomi Watts really does a great job, in all her various exploits, but despite it all, in the end, after meaningless affairs, drug/alcohol Hollywood parties, a lame agent, and a therapist she refers to as ""the rapist,"" Ellie makes progressively better decisions along the way, leading to a very satisfying end.Though slow at times, there are also frantic moments, and it's a shame this couldn't have been filmed, not videotaped.  I can relate to this on a personal level, but I'm sure a few million who've ever tried to get anywhere in the ""biz"" out west (or back east) but failed, for whatever reasons (and there are so many), will immediately find a connection here. This is a work which lends itself to repeated viewings, just to catch all the nuances and talents of Naomi.  She is at her best here, and while there are technical and other elements which detract from this flick, overall, it's a very good look into the life of one poor soul as she attempts to ""make it"" in the City of Angels (and lost souls).The final, ending shot is perfect and brought back a lot of memories, as a long time ago, it was my own final vision upon my own escape from LA.  Though with faults, this is a must-rent at least (or catch on cable), and any Naomi fan worth their salt will want to own this.  A rare and pretty damn good look into the soft underbelly of the ""promise"" and ""lies"" and ""hardships/impossibilities"" of Hollywoodland.  And with plenty of LA sights and sounds and characters (and who in LA ISN'T ONE?), which may also appeal to anyone who's ever lived there but just had to leave, for one reason or millions.Naomi Watts is obviously a great actress, based upon this and some of her other films, and I was only left with the ironic and satirical insight that there are probably 1000's of other wannabee Ellies out there, right now, right there, in the land of fruits and nuts who feel they are just as much an actress and talent as Naomi, if they could only get that big break.

970659,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000E8QV9M,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 7]","""Ellie Parker"" is originally a short film made in 2001, starring then comparatively unknown Naomi Watts as Ellie, actress wannabe trying to survive in Hollywood. Director of the film was Scott Coffey, who had been with Naomi Watts in ""Tank Girl"" back in 1995, and then again ""Mulholland Dr."" in 2001. Since the short was completed and shown at Sundance in 2001, Scott Coffey spent four years to develop the short film into a feature-length film shot with a digital camera, which is what you are about to watch.I wrote this background history of the film because the concept of the longer version wears thin as the plot unfolds. Still ever-reliable Naomi Watts is always impressive as Ellie, struggling to get a start in Hollywood, taking more than one audition in a day. See how Ellie practicing New York accents and doing her own make-up for the next audition while driving a car in LA. This is a hilarious scene, and also a bit painful to see, because this is too realistic, something that probably Naomi Watts knows first-hand.The film consists of the confused life of Ellie, which includes her relationship with her unfaithful boyfriend/musician wannabe Justin (Mark Pellegrino), her best friend Sam (Rebecca Rigg) and a new friend Chris (Scott Coffey), but the most interesting part of ""Ellie Parker"" is of course the convincing acting from Naomi Watts as Ellie. As her long-suffering agent Chevy Chase briefly appears, which is another merit of the film. Also, you see hardly recognizable Keanu Reeves as himself, member of the rock band Dogstar, but very briefly.""Ellie Parker"" is a good example of how a good actress like Naomi Watts can make up for the lack of story. Actually, as you know, the real story is Naomi Watts, who really became a real Hollywood star during the four years of shooting this film, starring in the films like ""King Kong"" (where she is to play another struggling actress Ann Darrow). In this film you will see a glimpse of the life of gifted Naomi Watts before the David Lynch film which made her internationally famous, and of thousands of those who are still trying to be like her.",3,"Naomi Watts Is Ellie Parker, Struggling to Get a Start in Hollywood ...

Martin ""Darkbard""","[1, 2]","Bottom-Line: Now I know why I never heard of Ellie Parker before, it is best forgotten!I think that Naomi Watts is a very talented actress--Tank Girl (1995) aside--so I decided to explore more of her work before and after her turn in Mulholland Drive (2001) when I first took note of her.  So when the critically acclaimed Ellie Parker (2001) came into my possession I decided to take a look.Story-LineWritten and directed by the Scott Coffey, Ellie Parker chronicles the days and nights of struggling actress Ellie Parker (Naomi Watts ~ The Ring, 21 Grams, We Don't Live Here Anymore).  That is pretty much it, there isn't much of a plot-line here...My ThoughtsEllie Parker is a bore!  It's hard to believe that the movie received two thumbs up from then Ebert & Roeper; were they watching the same boring yawn-inducing movie I was?  As I stated at the outset of this review, I think Naomi Watts is a very talented actress, but this movie, was well (what's another word for boring?) uninteresting, tedious, and mind-numbing!  So much so that half way through it I doubled the speed of the movie just so it would end quicker!The whole of Ellie Parker, shot as it was on digital video with handheld cameras and extreme close-up's, feels as if we are waiting for the real movie to start.  That the digital portion was Coffey roaming around town cashing in favors from his actor buddies and I was waiting for the move to get down to the business of telling a story.  There was never a feeling as though I was watching a ""real"" movie.  There was no plot; I do not find the real (fictional) lives of people I do not know all that interesting.In the end Ellie Parker lent itself to no real insight into the subject matter it was supposed to be portraying.  I learned nothing new; I might as well been watching paint dry!  Watts was her usual self acting her butt of with the material she was given, but frankly the material was beneath her.  Now I know why I never heard of Ellie Parker before, it is best forgotten!",2,"Yawn, yawn, yawn, What a Boring Little Film",1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,2010,"['Bottom-Line', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'never', 'heard', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'best', 'forgotten', 'think', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'Tank', 'Girl', '1995', 'aside', 'decided', 'explore', 'more', 'work', 'turn', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', '2001', 'when', 'first', 'took', 'note', 'So', 'when', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'Ellie', 'Parker', '2001', 'came', 'possession', 'decided', 'take', 'look.Story-LineWritten', 'directed', 'Scott', 'Coffey', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'days', 'nights', 'struggling', 'actress', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'Naomi', 'Watts', '~', 'Ring', '21', 'Grams', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Live', 'Here', 'Anymore', 'pretty', 'much', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot-line', 'here', 'My', 'ThoughtsEllie', 'Parker', 'bore', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'received', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'then', 'Ebert', 'Roeper', 'were', 'watching', 'same', 'boring', 'yawn-inducing', 'movie', 'was', 'stated', 'outset', 'review', 'think', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'movie', 'was', 'well', 'what', 'word', 'boring', 'uninteresting', 'tedious', 'mind-numbing', 'So', 'much', 'half', 'way', 'doubled', 'speed', 'movie', 'just', 'would', 'end', 'quicker', 'whole', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'shot', 'was', 'digital', 'video', 'handheld', 'cameras', 'extreme', 'close-up', 'feels', 'are', 'waiting', 'real', 'movie', 'start', 'digital', 'portion', 'was', 'Coffey', 'roaming', 'around', 'town', 'cashing', 'favors', 'actor', 'buddies', 'was', 'waiting', 'move', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'telling', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'feeling', 'was', 'watching', 'real', 'movie', 'was', 'plot', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'real', 'fictional', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'end', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'lent', 'real', 'insight', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'portraying', 'learned', 'nothing', 'new', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'watching', 'paint', 'dry', 'Watts', 'was', 'usual', 'self', 'acting', 'butt', 'material', 'was', 'given', 'frankly', 'material', 'was', 'Now', 'know', 'why', 'never', 'heard', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'best', 'forgotten']",N/A

Seriously, this movie could have cost about $1000 to make as far as camera equipment goes. That being said, the story is pretty engaging, and all the acting is superb.The entire film is based around Naomi Watts' title character, struggling actress Ellie Parker. We follow Ellie as she goes from audition to audition, to acting class, visiting her agent (Chevy Chase) and through the drama of her personal life as well.Naomi Watts gives a very raw hilarious all-out performance that I'd expect out of a stand up comedienne, but came as a pleasant surprise from Naomi Watts. What really endears me to her performance is knowing that she IS Naomi Watts. She didn't have to make this movie. She makes movies like King Kong and The Painted Veil, not tiny independent straight-to-video DV features. On the other hand, my wife felt the entire film was pretentious because she's playing a struggling actress when she is, in fact, one of the most successful and prominent actresses of our time. That's really up to you to decide. Either way, though, her performance is risky, intense, and exciting in a time of formulaic films.",4,"If you've been to a single audition, you can sympathize with Ellie Parker",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,1247,"['Ellie', 'Parker', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'considering', ""'ve"", 'never', 'heard', 'considering', 'filmed', 'Digital', 'Video', 'Seriously', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'cost', '1000', 'make', 'as', 'far', 'camera', 'equipment', 'being', 'said', 'story', 'pretty', 'engaging', 'acting', 'superb.The', 'entire', 'film', 'based', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'title', 'character', 'struggling', 'actress', 'Ellie', 'Parker', 'follow', 'Ellie', 'audition', 'audition', 'acting', 'class', 'visiting', 'agent', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'drama', 'personal', 'life', 'well.Naomi', 'Watts', 'very', 'raw', 'hilarious', 'all-out', 'performance', ""'d"", 'expect', 'stand', 'up', 'comedienne', 'came', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'What', 'really', 'performance', 'knowing', 'Naomi', 'Watts', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'movie', 'movies', 'King', 'Kong', 'Painted', 'Veil', 'not', 'tiny', 'independent', 'straight-to-video', 'DV', 'features', 'other', 'hand', 'wife', 'felt', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'pretentious', 'playing', 'struggling', 'actress', 'when', 'fact', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'prominent', 'actresses', 'time', 'really', 'up', 'decide', 'way', 'though', 'performance', 'risky', 'intense', 'exciting', 'time', 'formulaic', 'films']",N/A
