Where does one start when trying to describe Johnny Mathis? To use an old cliche` he is a legend in his time and he is one of my role models. Johnny did have an excellent voice teacher when he first started out but he also takes care of himself too. Sure he can't hit the high notes like he did when he was younger but that isn't the most important thing. This man literally loves to sing and you can hear it in the way he delivers a song. Or, if you're lucky enough to see him in person, it's very noticeable in his stage presence, expression on his face and you can hear it in his voice, he loves to sing. Johnny is one of the very few singers today who sings the romantic songs and the ballads the way they should be sung. I've seen Johnny in concert three times and am going to have the pleasure of seeing him once again in December, 2009. I hope Johnny is able to sing for many more years to come and it will be a sad day in entertainment when he retires.",5,Johnny Mathis 50th Celebration,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,1068,"[""'ve"", 'loved', 'admired', 'man', 'first', 'heard', 'sing', 'favorite', 'song', 'whole', 'world', 'Misty', 'Where', 'one', 'start', 'when', 'trying', 'describe', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'use', 'old', 'cliche', 'legend', 'time', 'one', 'role', 'models', 'Johnny', 'did', 'have', 'excellent', 'voice', 'teacher', 'when', 'first', 'started', 'out', 'also', 'care', 'too', 'Sure', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hit', 'high', 'notes', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'younger', ""n't"", 'most', 'important', 'thing', 'man', 'literally', 'sing', 'can', 'hear', 'way', 'song', ""'re"", 'lucky', 'enough', 'see', 'person', 'very', 'noticeable', 'stage', 'presence', 'expression', 'face', 'can', 'hear', 'voice', 'sing', 'Johnny', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'singers', 'today', 'who', 'romantic', 'songs', 'ballads', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'sung', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Johnny', 'concert', 'three', 'times', 'am', 'going', 'have', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'once', 'again', 'December', '2009', 'hope', 'Johnny', 'able', 'sing', 'many', 'more', 'years', 'come', 'will', 'be', 'sad', 'day', 'entertainment', 'when']",N/A
