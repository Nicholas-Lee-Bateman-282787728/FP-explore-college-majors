I've read other reviews complaining about its inaccuracies, which frankly I don't care much about as it's a myth that happened thousands of years ago.  If you want a night of action, adventure, and cheap CGI, pick up this DVD.  BUT...NBC was originally supposed to air this as a two-night four-hour miniseries (roughly 180 minutes minus commercials), but decided instead to butcher the movie and fit it into a three-hour timeslot (roughly 135 minutes minus commercials), which is what you're given in this DVD.  Sci-Fi recently aired the four-hour miniseries in its entirety, with all the cut scenes intact.  If you haven't seen the miniseries and don't care mcuh for what was cut, then you might as well get this DVD.  But if you were like me and actually saw the original cut, wait for LionsGate and Hallmark to release the original 177-minute version.In Australia and Europe, the film is released in its original 177-minute version, so if you have a multi-region player, I'd suggest importing from there.",2,Buyer Beware: This is the cut version,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",2005,1204,"['passable', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'three', 'stars', 'lost', 'star', 'due', 'release', 'version', 'being', 'offered.Before', 'get', 'time', 'issue', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'was', 'entertaining', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'complaining', 'inaccuracies', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'myth', 'happened', 'thousands', 'years', 'ago', 'want', 'night', 'action', 'adventure', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'pick', 'up', 'DVD', 'BUT', 'NBC', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'air', 'two-night', 'four-hour', 'miniseries', 'roughly', '180', 'minutes', 'minus', 'commercials', 'decided', 'instead', 'butcher', 'movie', 'fit', 'three-hour', 'timeslot', 'roughly', '135', 'minutes', 'minus', 'commercials', 'what', ""'re"", 'given', 'DVD', 'Sci-Fi', 'recently', 'aired', 'four-hour', 'miniseries', 'entirety', 'cut', 'intact', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'miniseries', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'mcuh', 'what', 'was', 'cut', 'then', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'DVD', 'were', 'actually', 'saw', 'original', 'cut', 'wait', 'LionsGate', 'Hallmark', 'release', 'original', '177-minute', 'version.In', 'Australia', 'Europe', 'film', 'released', 'original', '177-minute', 'version', 'so', 'have', 'multi-region', 'player', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'importing', 'there']",Hercules hhe / Artisan
922837,A1ZLFCUF4XX7RZ,B000A6T1ZE,Alex,"[0, 0]","I know the story of Hercules pretty well. It's one of my favourite myths from Greek mythology. I wish that they would have used his Greek name instead of the Roman version, but I think people would have been thrown off by that.This movie is a revamped version of the myth and nothing like the Disney version. Hercules wasn't hated by his mother, but by Hera. In this film it seems to be his mother who does most of the hating and uses Hera as an excuse. The ""fight"" between Zeus and Hera's followers is based on the theory that Goddess religions were taken over by God religions. I don't think that was really necessary to put into the film.But besides that, and the lack of going through the 12 labours, it was an OK movie. The acting was OK, the special effects left something to be desired at some points, but the main jist of the story was there.

They even enlist the aide of his new wife Megara and his three young sons. When their plan fails and results in the deaths of the three children Hercules is blamed and is banished from the Kingdom.

922840,AB34G6VKP28L,B000A6T1ZE,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[3, 3]","The oldest known form of storytelling can be found in legends. The stories of Achilles, Hercules, and other Greek gods and heroes have been passed down through the centuries as a monument not only to the fantasies of old but revelations of truth throughout the ages. Hercules is one of the better-known tales, but this is not the light-hearted approach of Disney. This is a torrid, dark tale of triumph against inner and outer evils.It is the night of the festival to honor the goddess Hero, when a blood sacrifice must be made in order to appease her for yet another season. High Priestess Alcmene (Elizabeth Perkins) offends the gods when she attempts to kill a half-man, half-woman oracle and removes from him his sight. As punishment, she is raped by an unknown god in human form believed to be Zeus. Her husband Amphitryon (Timothy Dalton) does not believe this, and swears to murder the child if one is born of the unholy union. The oracle predicts that two sons will be born, but only one of them will belong to Amphitryon. When the children are born, Alcmene bears them into the swamps where the Harpies dwell and asks that the son of Zeus be killed. The creatures refuse to spill his blood, and all of her attempts to be rid of her son Hercules are thwarted.A strong and temperamental child, Hercules draws the unwanted attention of the crown when in a fit of madness, he strikes down his tutor (Sean Astin) and appears to have killed him. Forced to flee into the mountains and escape the wrath of punishment, there he dwells until it becomes known that a two-headed monster is ravaging the city of Thebes. Now a grown man, Hercules (Paul Telfer) starts off on a destiny that will lead him to dark places, from the gates of Hades to the favor of a beautiful wood nymph (Leelee Sobieski). Through it all, his mother looks upon him with repulsion and prays Hero will bring an end to his life, as an affront against Zeus, his father and guardian. I must admit that my knowledge of Hercules is a trifle rusty since it has been many years since I studied this particular legend, but the film only covers half of his grand adventures.There are six trials Hercules must complete in order to atone for his sins, which involve the unintentional murder of his three sons. Most of his adversaries will be known to anyone with an interest in mythology, and it was fascinating to see such creatures as centaurs, harpies, sphinx, and two-headed dragons come to life. There is even a mention of the three-headed dog that guards the gates of the underworld. The special effects range from being extremely poor (the mythical stag of the wood is very badly animated) to quite good (the harpies are fantastic!), and the acting follows a similar pattern. There are moments when it is good enough to forget how bad some of the dialogue is. The most impressive thing about the production is the costuming. I loved the light, airy fabrics used for the wood nymphs and the beautiful lace of the high priestesses.There were moments when I truly enjoyed it, because I am fascinated with ancient Greece and Rome and their cultures and mythologies, but to be honest the excessively dark tone of the production troubled me. More disconcerting is the belief of the actors involved in the project (through interviews on the disk) is that they seem to feel this is an appropriate fantasy for children.

Films such as 'Alexander' and 'Troy' for cinematic release, or the recent made-for-television series such as 'Caesar', 'Spartacus', and 'Helen of Troy' all set out with lofty, almost Olympian ambitions, but fail to deliver divine visions.  The same is true here - relative newcomer Paul Telfer (also appearing in the above-mentioned 'Spartacus') certainly has the physique of a Herculean figure, and is a reasonable actor, but the dialogue is a bit stilted - I can't be sure if they wanted 'Greek Epic' or colloquial familiarity, and I'm not sure the writers and director ever quite decided, either.The crew of actors is not bad here, so the acting is usually reasonably well done for a b-film (and so long as one keeps in mind that one is watching a b-film, expectations are held in check).  Sean Astin plays much the same kind of role in this film that he plays in 'Lord of the Rings' - the ever-faithful sidekick, but without Tolkien's great character.  Leeanna Walsman plays Megara, Hercules' first wife, reasonably well, without too much melodrama, despite the tragedy of her situation.  Kristian Schmid as King Eurystheus is a bit flat, but again that may be the dialogue as much as the acting.  Leelee Sobieski also does a good job with the role of Deianeira, the mystical figure who falls in love with Hercules and helps him in subtle ways on his labours.The one great disappointment of this film is that the the CGI special effects seem to be rather ill-constructed and stand out as obvious insertions; it reminded me of the kinds of obviously phony inserted special effects from similar Greek epic and science fiction films of the 1980s.  Surely the technology has been upgraded since then in the studios where this film was finished.The labours are a bit shortened and modified somewhat from the legends, but for those unfamiliar with them, this is an introduction that will hopefully lead them to want to learn more.  This is certainly far closer to the real Hercules legends than the Kevin Sorbo series of years past.There is violence, but it is fairly muted, and some sexual content, but very mild even by soap-opera standards.  Telfer never misses an opportunity to take his shirt off, Sobieski hints at being unclothed in a scene or two, but rarely does it get more erotic than that.I'd give this three-and-a-half stars, given the option, but I'll grade on a Herculean curve, and give it four here.

The main problem that I had with the series was that although it is a sympathetic potrayal of the demi god and in many instances followed the mythological tales, the hero is not - heroic. While many people decry the sword and sandal Italian epics the first two Reeves films were excellent and, in my opinion the first had some superb heroic moments. There is nothing in this series to equal the shot of Hercules standing on a hill flanked by Castor and Polux or in the temple renouncing his immortality while the rain falls.

922848,A21G7YMX8M7Z4T,B000A6T1ZE,Kevis Hendrickson,"[1, 1]","Without a doubt, Hercules is one of the enduring mythological characters who seems to get reinvented for every generation. From Lou Ferrigno to Kevin Sorbo to animated versions and now finally reinvented for a live-action television mini-series.I have to admit that I grow more impressed with this movie every time I watch it. Some people might argue that this Hallmmark produced Hercules takes itself a little too seriously, while others would contend that it is not serious enough. In my opinion, the reason this movie works is precisely because the filmmakers really paid attention to the mythos of Hercules for their interpretation of the 'Son of Zeus' and introduces us to a very mortal, and all too-human version of history's most popular Greek hero.Unlike other versions of Hercules which focus on his exploits, this film is very centered on Hercules' character. The major difference between this contemporary version of Hercules and his predecessors is that, like the film Troy, this movie sells itself as being the 'real' story of Hercules rather than the fantasized 'half-man, half god' one we encounter in Greek Mythology. This is not to say that there aren't any Gods in the world this Hercules inhabits. We just don't see them and are left to wonder if they are influencing events or if everything has a real world explanation.The idea that a real world Hercules may (or may not) have a divine being as his father forces him to decide if the events of his life are caused by destiny, or if he is the one who decides his own fate. The Freudian nature of this story sets the stage for a very compelling and timeless drama.The Good: Most of the actors in this film play their parts very well; it is a credit to the filmmakers that they sought out lesser known, but proficient actors to play the roles in this film. Having Timothy Dalton star in this film was also a nice treat.The Bad: The most glaring shortcoming of this film is that because its budget is small, the movie suffers visually. To be sure, the filmmakers did the best they could with what they had and the film even looks good for the most part. But there are times where I just wish there was a little more eye-candy. With that said, this film probably has the best rendition of the Hydra ever seen in any Hercules film.In short, I have nothing but praises to sing about this movie, even though I believe this movie would have been better suited as a large budget film like Troy. I highly recommend this film to all fans of Greek mythology, but more importantly, to people who enjoy a well-written and acted movie.",4,Not bad.

922851,A4EFCH8II6U3P,B000A6T1ZE,Medraut,"[7, 11]","A fair protrayial of the Hercules legend, not great but worth watching.There have been many Hercules movies. None of them have come any where near the real myths. The earliest Herc movies the Steve Reeves movies only spawened the 'sword and sandal' movies. From Reeves to his sucessors all took on the name of Hercules but none of the moives got close to the legend. Even the Disnay movie seems like a slight rip off of CLASH OF TITANS. The Kevin Sorbo series are a bit white washed as well. It is Hera, not Hercules, that kills his sons.This movie is somewhat better then these earlier attempts. though it is not great it is well done and it keeps the legend in mind, even if it is not a true depiction of the legend. still it uses the legends to a much greater degree then earlier depictions. again they show that Herc is not just a hero but a man tainted by his own sins. Which is much closer to the original legends. although again this movie presents a slightly jared version of Hercules Labors, but despite that the movie is not unwatchable.At the start of the movie we are taken to a time of myth and legend. Amphitiron (Timothy Dalton) has come back from war while his wife Alcmene (Elizabeth Perkins) prays to the goddess Hera. Amphitrion is angry that Zeus has brought a storm during his homcoming, a slave, Antaeus (Tyler Mane) rebels and is cast aside. In this movie we never see the Gods only their worshipers. Hera and Zeus are mentioned but never seen. their followers war with one another for dominace. we see male against female for superiorty. Hera is almost depicted as a type of 'mother goddess' with Zeus as the usurping male god.Alcemene is about to sacrifice to Hera but the sacrifice is not a man but a hermaphrodite named Tiresias, Alcmene blinds the man instead of killing him. (indeed in the legend it is said Tiresias is half female given female parts by Hera but given the second sight by Zeus). Tiresias tells Alemene that Zeus shall punish her. that night she sees someone she thinks is her husband and is raped, yet Amphytrion tells her he was still at his ship. Alcemene thinks it was Zeus that slept with her that night. She wants the child slain, but learns she is to have twins. she consults the Harpies messengers of Hera. the harpys breast feed the child but decline to kill him they call him Hercules ""hera's glory"", the actual Greek name is indeed Heracles (This scene seems to be based on the legend that Hera herself once breast fed Heracles when he was young, not knowing who he was and the boy pinched her breast to hard. also it is Hermes who, in jeast calls the boy Heracles). Alcmene then sets snakes into the boy's bed and Herc kills them both (a famous myth of Hercules' childhood). Young Herc grows older and learns from the centar Charon along with his half brother Iphicles, whoe envies and hates his halfbrother. they also learn music under Linus (Sean Astin), but Linus slaps Herc and Herc hits him with his lyer and thinks he has killed him, though Linus is later saved. Here we see that as in the legend though not the most smartest of men Herc is often quick to anger and to act, with out thinking. (In the legend Linus was the brother of Orpheus, but Herc killed him when he struck him for not playing the lyer very well). For pennence for his crime Herc is banished. before he is banished he mates with Megara, a servent of Hera, while she is drunk. Young Herc lives in the wild and grows to be a strong man. Herculse (Paul Telfer) has become a strong man indeed over the years. He returns in hopes of serving his father and seeing his home. he and his father fight the Hydra but Amphitrion is slain. Hercules returns to serve Creon and wed Megara. Megara is persuaded by Alcemene to trick Hercules. thus Megara gives Hercules a strange potion and his sons by her are sent to mock attack him. Herc in his delirium slays all three of his boys. For his sins Hercules must be punished.  again we see that allthough heros are great they are not perfect. Alcemene points out the very crux of Hercules nature, which is very true to the legend, Herc's greatest enemie is himself. It is his own rash actions that often lead him into trouble. Herc goes to the orcal of Delphi to take counsil. the orcal is reveled to be Tireseus, who serves as both female orcal and male prophet. Tireseus is a person of balance. Herc is told he must serve King Eurystheus. Herc reluctenly agrees to do so in order to be washed of his crimes. Herc is told to fight the Stymphalian birds (Which in legend where man eaters) here these birds are in fact the very Harpies that named him. Next Herc is sent after the Nemian Lion (which in legend could be touched or hamred by no weapon) here the lion terns out to be a Sphynx. Herc then must deal with the Creatian bull (in the original legend a rather large bull which Herc must bring back alive) here the bull is the name of a bandit, who turns out to be Anteus, as in legend Anteus is a giant who draws his power from the mother earth. Herc then must hunt the Ceryneian hind, which he only wounds but does not kill. All the while his mother still plots to have her son Iphicles become king. Iphicles himself has become the lover of king Eurystheus hopeing to gain his trust (interestingly it is said in some old legends that is Hercules that was Eurystheus lover and preformed the labors willingly). Megara, however, has her own plots in mind and refuses to be anyone's pawn. Hercules is given one final labor to bring back Cerberus, but again things are not as they seems as Herc only finds Anteus and defeats him and he returns to court. he has also leanred who is his true father. Herc sues Eurystheus for peace but the king will hear none of this. Hercules wins out in the end, not just because he his a hero but it is because of his flaws that make him great. Herc weds Deianeria (Leelee Sobieski), who here is a nymph. The movie ends in peace. (although read Sophacles to see what happened with Deianeria and Hercules.)Again though this movie may not be the best ever, the effects not a hundread percent, and though not a complet veiw of the legend it is not unwatchable. all the actors are spot on, the plot is well done, and it is far better then most tvminiseries that have been made. It is the depiction of the hero as being only human both great and flawed that truly makes this movie remarkable. it is this that gives the movie a true Greek touch in a way. it is an entertaining movie if nothing else.This movie allows the veiewer the will to learn more of the Herc story. weather reading the plays of Euripides or Sophicles, or the Libary of Apolodors. Bullfince breifly touches on the Herc legend and Edith Hamilton tells his story. I highly recomend Rober Graves book of GREEK MYTHS which tells the full Herc cycle and story.",3,"IMPERFECT MEN CAN DO GREAT DEEDS, BUT GREAT MEN CAN DO IMPERFECT DEEDS.",1136592000,"01 7,

922855,A3JLOIXFM75QNV,B000A6T1ZE,"Valerya Couto ""LOTRsherlockHPFreak""","[6, 9]","I love watching anything regarding mythology but this was a horrendous mini-series. To start with, most importantly and most noticably, the editing is AWFUL. Its all over the place and clearly noticable. It jumps way too much and you have to sort of get your bearings and remember what you just watched 2 seconds ago. It is very distracting and perhaps the most negative aspect about this mini-series. Secondly, the acting was, at times, cringe-worthy. I don't understand how a film with well-known accomplished actors could flub up so bad. I must say, I really liked Timothy Dalton in this. He was the only one who seemed genuinely interested in actually acting. The man that plays Hercules had his high and low points. I was even dissapointed in Sean Astin.Also, if you are not terribly familiar with the story of Hercules, this mini-series will only complicate the matter. It is congested and just too messy at times to make sense. The script is poor and even for a mini-series, it was too long. Again, it mostly goes back to the bad editing. It just jumps annoyingly from one scene to another.Visually, the film also fell short. I know the budget isn't grand but the effects at times were cheesy and appalling. I loved the look of the Cleopatra Mini-Series, and that is even older than this! All in all, I am actually surprised that I sat through the whole thing. I've only seen it once but I think the run time on TV was something like 6pm-12am. I would never watch this again. It was almost unbearable. I usually don't give anything a 1 star rating, but I feel that strongly after having to watch this awful series.",1,Overly long and droll,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,1621,"['love', 'watching', 'anything', 'regarding', 'mythology', 'was', 'horrendous', 'mini-series', 'start', 'most', 'importantly', 'most', 'noticably', 'editing', 'AWFUL', 'place', 'clearly', 'noticable', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'have', 'sort', 'get', 'bearings', 'remember', 'what', 'just', 'watched', '2', 'seconds', 'ago', 'very', 'distracting', 'perhaps', 'most', 'negative', 'aspect', 'mini-series', 'Secondly', 'acting', 'was', 'times', 'cringe-worthy', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'film', 'well-known', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'could', 'flub', 'up', 'so', 'bad', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'liked', 'Timothy', 'Dalton', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'actually', 'acting', 'man', 'Hercules', 'had', 'high', 'low', 'points', 'was', 'even', 'dissapointed', 'Sean', 'Astin.Also', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'familiar', 'story', 'Hercules', 'mini-series', 'will', 'only', 'complicate', 'matter', 'congested', 'just', 'too', 'messy', 'times', 'make', 'sense', 'script', 'poor', 'even', 'mini-series', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'Again', 'mostly', 'back', 'bad', 'editing', 'just', 'annoyingly', 'one', 'scene', 'another.Visually', 'film', 'also', 'fell', 'short', 'know', 'budget', ""n't"", 'grand', 'effects', 'times', 'were', 'cheesy', 'appalling', 'loved', 'look', 'Cleopatra', 'Mini-Series', 'even', 'older', 'am', 'actually', 'surprised', 'sat', 'whole', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'once', 'think', 'run', 'time', 'TV', 'was', 'something', '6pm-12am', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'was', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'feel', 'strongly', 'having', 'watch', 'awful', 'series']",Hercules hhe / Artisan
