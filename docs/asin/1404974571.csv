168560,A33L7G4E8CID3,1404974571,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[2, 5]","This movie is destined to be forgotten as yet another stud in the studios' loser belt for summer of 2005. Part of this was due to the prepondrance of remakes, which in turn was due to the studios' refusal to risk anything and try to hedge their bets by green-lighting projects with presumably built-in audiences. My rant over, if you're here, you're probably inclined to buy the movie. To be perfectly honest, this was a below-average cookie-cutter comedy, but it only really starts to tank in the second half. The first half highlights Will Ferrell's antics as a vain, faltering movie star who agrees to take on a retooled version of the classic titular TV show, but only if he's the focus of it. In addition, there is lots of good supporting talent, such as Jason Schwartzman, Michael Caine, The Daily Show's Stephen Colbert and Steve Carrell. Sadly, the movie never quite congeals. The modern remake entails one of two approaches: either make everything the same, only with new faces (i.e. Psycho, SWAT, etc.) or engage in in-jokes, postmodern trickery, and so on. The latter group includes such landmarks of modern cinema as Starsky & Hutch. The problem with Bewitched is that it tries to do both. The everything-the-same approach necessitates that Nicole Kidman really be a witch, and the in-jokes portion includes plenty of showbiz-type absurdities that work much better on paper than on film. As soon as the studio-mandated love story kicks in, the humor has pretty much ended.Hopefully, after the drought of '05, studios will think twice before green-lighting lackluster remakes. Will Ferrell's moments alone are worth renting the movie, and it avoids being a complete piece of crap, like The Honeymooners remake. However, remaking one of the most beloved TV shows in history is a tall order, and I give the filmmakers credit for at least trying something different. Note to Nora Ephron: You've Got Mail, Michael, and now Bewitched together make three strikes.

If you have never seen it, the gist of it is simply that a modern witch - the &#34;real television-land kind&#34;, just wants to live like a mortal, without her natural twitchy abilities to summon up almost anything she can imagine. She falls in love with an ultra-straight dude who is mortified to learn the truth and worse, meet his future mother in law, but who marries her anyway because hey, that's love.In this story, the writers did a smart thing: they didn't try to recreate the successful  - and beloved - original. In this version, Will Ferrell is an actor taking his slippery manager's advice too closely for his own good, but who nevertheless finds the exact right girl to play &#34;Samantha&#34; in a remake. As in the original, he falls in love with the &#34;average girl next door&#34; played by Nicole Kidman to perfection, and talks her into taking the acting job with the intention of making the series all about HIM, &#34;Darren the mortal&#34;.

Will Ferrell delivers his usual goofy, over-the-top performance, which suits his character just fine.  And at the heart of it all is a sweet and (mostly) old-fashioned love story.  It also pays due reverence to its source, as Isabel keeps a picture of Elizabeth Montgomery in her dressing room, and wonders what the ""real"" Samantha would do.  Sure, it's not perfect.  In fact (minor spoiler alert!), I knocked off a whole star for the whole ""Uncle Arthur"" nonesense in the final act.  But I laughed.  A lot, in fact.  I was delighted with Kidman's performance.

The cast is fine and hit their marks, but they don't have much in the way to inspire them.Basically this interpretation is almost too clever for its own good.  It revels in a deconstructive approach and although it's fairly entertaining at times, I would have preferred a straight rendition of everyone's favorite magical suburban housewife.  When generous clips of Elizabeth Montgomery and the original cast are shown, you can't help but get nostalgic about the old show.  The delightful banter and familial friction between Endora & 'Derwood' was one of the many reasons the show worked so well and it's sorely missed here.  When you throw out so much of the old, to bring in the hipper new, something is definitely lost in the transformation.  And not to be overly cynical, but with today's TV DVD sets outselling many films, you can't help but wonder if a lot of this production wasn't dressed up as a big commercial for the classic sitcom with so much product placement served up as legitimate story fodder.  Indeed, the recently released DVD is packaged with an ""exclusive separate disc with 4 episodes of the TV series.""  Isn't marketing wonderful?When Michael Caine turns to Nicole Kidman and says something about him being a witch, it's just one of those little things they forgot.  Isn't he a Warlock?  Didn't Isabelle go on and on about the horrors of dating those bad, egotistical Warlocks?  Oh, I know it's the SAME THING only a different NAME - gender roles and all that being considered.Bewitched is just the opposite.  It's the SAME NAME - but a different THING from the TV show.

168570,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1404974571,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 4]","I will admit right off the bat that I have never seen the original television show, so maybe that alone explains why I didn't loathe this movie as so many others have.  I have nothing to really base hatred off of.  I actually found this film to be slightly funny and overall very entertaining.  Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell work really well together.  I've never really thought of Nicole Kidman as `funny' but she delivers here in a very unexpected and charming way, and while Ferrell is not his zany best he is still hilarious in scenes and worthy of mention.`Bewitched' is less a remake and more a film about a remake.  That is probably the first thing that must be said about this movie.  In the end it has many similarities to a remake but it is not technically a `remake'.  The movie is about an actor, Jack Wyatt, on the verge of being washed up.  He needs to make an impact and soon before he loses all control over his career and becomes a has-been.  He has a genius idea of remaking the classic beloved television show `Bewitched' and, in an effort to draw attention to himself, he decides to cast a nobody in the lead as Samantha.  This `nobody' is Isabel Bigalow who just so happens to be a witch who, much like Samantha, just wants to be a normal person.Isabel decides to take the offer but upon hearing that Jack only wanted her to make him look good she decides to get even, never imagining that she'd fall in love with him and visa-versa.Parts of the film don't work and I will say that the funniest gags in the film are stolen from some other slightly funnier movies but they still work here despite their familiarity.  Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman work hard to make the dialog work and their relationship seem genuine.  Kidman embraces her characters naivety as well as her impish charm and Ferrell sinks deep into his characters conceited chauvinist nature.  Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine are a bit lost here.  They don't have much to do and were most likely approached to add some appeal to the baby boomer crowd, which is a shame since they could have been used a little fuller in my opinion.  The real gem here though is Jason Schwartzman who is just hilarious as Wyatt's agent Ritchie.  He is the perfect supporting character here, adding layers of funny and delivering his lines brilliantly.

It's a movie that's based on an old TV show... are those ever good? The answer is, usually not. But Bewitched is a fun, light, romantic comedy, in true Nora and Delia Ephron style that will make you leave the theater smiling. And unlike previous movies based on TV, this one is cleverly written. My biggest qualm with this movie is that it's a bit slow, but Ferrell and Kidman more than make up for that with their amazing chemistry.Kidman plays Isabel, a witch who just wants to live a normal life. Her father Nigel (Michael Caine... so funny!!) discourages her from doing this, telling her not to hide from her true self. She, of course, ignores his warnings, but just can't seem to kick the magical side of herself. As she strolls through Bed, Bath and Beyond, she smiles at a couple arguing about paint-- ""I want to argue about paint!"" she says. However, she ends up paying for all her new towels and kitchen utensils with a tarot card. ""That's my last thing as a witch,"" she says to her father. Meanwhile, actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) is struggling to get back his acting career. He decides to star in a remake of the TV show Bewitched, and on the advice of his assistant (Jason Schwartzman), makes lots of ridiculous demands-- ""Go make me twenty capuccinos and bring me the best one!"" He wants to cast an unknown in the role of Samantha, finding Isabel one day in a bookstore (she wiggles her nose so well!) and begging her to be his TV wife. She agrees, but learns that it's difficult to work with a demanding jerk... whom she really likes.It's such a funny movie, I definitely recommend it. I wasn't the only one laughing out loud throughout this movie! In many ways, it is the typical romantic comedy... but throw in a witch played by Nicole Kidman and the hilarious Will Ferrell... well, that's a great movie right there!",4,Ferrell and Kidman Shine!,1119657600,"06 25, 2005",2005,1928,"['Today', 'got', 'up', 'just', 'decided', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'Bewitched', 'course', 'was', 'skeptical', 'movie', 'based', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'are', 'ever', 'good', 'answer', 'usually', 'not', 'Bewitched', 'fun', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'true', 'Nora', 'Delia', 'Ephron', 'style', 'will', 'make', 'leave', 'theater', 'smiling', 'previous', 'movies', 'based', 'TV', 'one', 'cleverly', 'written', 'biggest', 'qualm', 'movie', 'bit', 'slow', 'Ferrell', 'Kidman', 'more', 'make', 'up', 'amazing', 'chemistry.Kidman', 'Isabel', 'witch', 'who', 'just', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'father', 'Nigel', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'so', 'funny', 'doing', 'telling', 'not', 'hide', 'true', 'self', 'course', 'warnings', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'kick', 'magical', 'side', 'herself', 'Bed', 'Bath', 'Beyond', 'couple', 'arguing', 'paint', 'want', 'argue', 'paint', 'However', 'up', 'paying', 'new', 'towels', 'kitchen', 'utensils', 'tarot', 'card', 'last', 'thing', 'witch', 'father', 'Meanwhile', 'actor', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'Ferrell', 'struggling', 'get', 'back', 'acting', 'career', 'star', 'remake', 'TV', 'show', 'Bewitched', 'advice', 'assistant', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'lots', 'ridiculous', 'demands', 'Go', 'make', 'twenty', 'capuccinos', 'bring', 'best', 'one', 'cast', 'unknown', 'role', 'Samantha', 'finding', 'Isabel', 'one', 'day', 'bookstore', 'nose', 'so', 'well', 'begging', 'be', 'TV', 'wife', 'difficult', 'work', 'demanding', 'jerk', 'whom', 'really', 'likes.It', 'such', 'funny', 'movie', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'was', ""n't"", 'only', 'one', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'movie', 'many', 'ways', 'typical', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'throw', 'witch', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'hilarious', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'well', 'great', 'movie', 'right', 'there']",N/A

I loved watching Bewitched as a kid and when we were 13 or so, my best friend and I used to bounce Bewitched ideas off of each other with ""what if"" premises.  Some of these had us laughing in stitches.  For example, what if Endora mistakenly thinks ""Derwood"" is having a little hanky panky with a secretary and she poxes him by making his genitals completely disappear.  He discovers this when he goes to the urinal and he can't find the goods.  Of course Larry is at the next urinal wondering what's wrong.  Next scene, Darren's doctor is mystifed and asks him, ""how do you pee""?What I was looking for was not so much a movie that honors the original characters.  I didn't care if there was an Uncle Arthur or an Aunt Agnes who stayed true to character.  I wanted the movie to stay true to the concept: that being the humor in silly and seemingly impossible things happening to serious people.  The situation creates the humor.  You don't need a gag actor like Will Farrell for that.  Silly things happening to a Marx brother style goofball is too lame for my taste.  One irony I found is that in the Darren role, Farrel is playing a self-obsessed ""it's all about me"" actor, and it turns out that the movie is really all about him and his unfunny (for me) goofball antics.Be warned: this movie has not a single laugh-out-loud moment. Not even a single suppressed-chuckle moment.  It is a fatally flawed unfunny attempt at comedy, in which the writers failed to concoct any funny situations.  Being that the original Bewitched was written for tv in the 60's, there was a lot of material that was off-limits then that is now accessible to even a PG-13 movie (see example above).

168577,A2582KMXLK2P06,1404974571,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Wow, I didn't think movies could get this bad.  What seemed like Will Ferrell not being his typical obnoxious and unfunny self for the first 40 minutes, quickly goes by the wayside as his horrendous tendencies return.  That's only part of the problem believe it or not.I grew up a big fan of the classic Bewitched TV show.  It was funny, smart had an outrageous concept (a witch wiggles her nose and suddenly magic occurs and everyone does what she says) but I can promise you, this is NOTHING like the old TV show.  I mean this film does a complete 180.  First of all this movie is written from a romantic comedy point of view but I have to ask- exactly what kind of person would find this drivel funny?  You'd have to have an enormous amount of perseverance to put up with the unfunniest comedian of all-time in Will Ferrell, and the actual romantic portions are too far-fetched and hokey to find appealing.  Seriously, what audience is this for?Let's talk about the extremely poor storyline.  Besides the obvious misstep of believing that utilizing romance when it's plainly obvious that the show is more appropriate as a comedy and should be focused as such, there's other problems.  At first Will Ferrell and the other movie directors spend 20 minutes searching for the perfect woman who can match the legendary Elizabeth Montgomery of the original Bewitched, and in particular a woman who can wiggle her nose the right way.  They want to recreate Bewitched.  This is where Nicole Kidman comes in since she auditions for/fits the role.  Little do they know she's actually a witch, however.  Then, they actually pretend to film episodes of Bewitched on the big stage while rehearsing.  By this point I'm thinking ""Could the writers have possibly thought of anything more misguided?""The second half of the movie however, is when it all falls apart and the reality that no actual interesting storyline is ever going to occcur at all.  The second half is all about Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell flirting with each other for WAY too long (like 45 minutes) and never accomplishing anything substantial the entire time.  They waste our time like it's never been wasted before.  I mean geez, at least they could have given Nicole plenty of interesting magic spells to toy around with!  Something other than... this.For a moment I thought the movie would improve when Nicole Kidman overheard the movie director and Will bad mouthing her behind her back (literally) and therefore became so upset that she desired to bring back the witch spells that she promised she'd never use again (because her objective is to be human like everyone else) but sadly I was wrong.  Nothing I'd never consider worthy of entertainment ever came of this.  The only thing that occurs from this point forward is that Will Ferrell grows increasingly obnoxious as he becomes closer to Nicole Kidman, so he spends his time being flirtatious.  And if you're a guy and you think Will Ferrell is incredibly unfunny, seeing him act this way will be *unbelievably annoying*.  I guess women find his character cute and that's probably why he got the role in this film, but I'm a guy- I think he's a terrible and overrated comedian.  Steve Carrell makes an appearance near the end... and it's garbage too.I actually had a dream last night about Elizabeth Montgomery.  I woke up, wanted to know if she was alive or dead, and found out she died 5 days before my mom died back in '95... on my mom's birthday.  Weird series of events there.  When I had the opportunity to watch Bewitched I thought this was some kind of strange coincidence like I was supposed to watch it.  I guess not!  Too bad this movie completely misses the mark.  I mean *completely*.  A must avoid!  I'm still shocked.  On a final note it should be said that I don't mind movie remakes of old TV shows... but they have to be comparable to the TV show to an extent which is clearly not the case here.",1,loss for words,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",2013,3933,"['Wow', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movies', 'could', 'get', 'bad', 'What', 'seemed', 'like', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'not', 'being', 'typical', 'obnoxious', 'unfunny', 'self', 'first', '40', 'minutes', 'quickly', 'wayside', 'horrendous', 'tendencies', 'return', 'only', 'part', 'problem', 'believe', 'not.I', 'grew', 'up', 'big', 'fan', 'classic', 'Bewitched', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'funny', 'smart', 'had', 'outrageous', 'concept', 'witch', 'nose', 'suddenly', 'magic', 'occurs', 'everyone', 'what', 'can', 'promise', 'NOTHING', 'old', 'TV', 'show', 'mean', 'film', 'complete', '180', 'First', 'movie', 'written', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'point', 'view', 'have', 'ask-', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'would', 'find', 'drivel', 'funny', ""'d"", 'have', 'have', 'enormous', 'amount', 'perseverance', 'put', 'up', 'unfunniest', 'comedian', 'all-time', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'actual', 'romantic', 'portions', 'are', 'too', 'far-fetched', 'hokey', 'find', 'appealing', 'Seriously', 'what', 'audience', 'Let', 'talk', 'extremely', 'poor', 'storyline', 'obvious', 'misstep', 'believing', 'utilizing', 'romance', 'when', 'plainly', 'obvious', 'show', 'more', 'appropriate', 'comedy', 'should', 'be', 'focused', 'such', 'other', 'problems', 'first', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'other', 'movie', 'directors', 'spend', '20', 'minutes', 'searching', 'perfect', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'match', 'legendary', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'original', 'Bewitched', 'particular', 'woman', 'who', 'can', 'wiggle', 'nose', 'right', 'way', 'want', 'recreate', 'Bewitched', 'where', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'role', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'actually', 'witch', 'however', 'Then', 'actually', 'pretend', 'film', 'episodes', 'Bewitched', 'big', 'stage', 'rehearsing', 'point', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'Could', 'writers', 'have', 'possibly', 'thought', 'anything', 'more', 'misguided', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'however', 'when', 'apart', 'reality', 'actual', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'ever', 'going', 'occcur', 'second', 'half', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'flirting', 'other', 'WAY', 'too', 'long', '45', 'minutes', 'never', 'accomplishing', 'anything', 'substantial', 'entire', 'time', 'waste', 'time', 'never', 'been', 'wasted', 'mean', 'geez', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'Nicole', 'plenty', 'interesting', 'magic', 'spells', 'toy', 'around', 'Something', 'other', 'this.For', 'moment', 'thought', 'movie', 'would', 'improve', 'when', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'movie', 'director', 'Will', 'bad', 'mouthing', 'back', 'literally', 'therefore', 'became', 'so', 'upset', 'desired', 'bring', 'back', 'witch', 'promised', ""'d"", 'never', 'use', 'again', 'objective', 'be', 'human', 'everyone', 'else', 'sadly', 'was', 'wrong', 'Nothing', ""'d"", 'never', 'consider', 'worthy', 'entertainment', 'ever', 'came', 'only', 'thing', 'point', 'forward', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'increasingly', 'obnoxious', 'closer', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'time', 'being', 'flirtatious', ""'re"", 'guy', 'think', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'incredibly', 'unfunny', 'seeing', 'act', 'way', 'will', 'be', '*unbelievably', 'annoying*', 'guess', 'women', 'find', 'character', 'cute', 'probably', 'why', 'got', 'role', 'film', ""'m"", 'guy-', 'think', 'terrible', 'overrated', 'comedian', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'appearance', 'end', 'garbage', 'too.I', 'actually', 'had', 'dream', 'last', 'night', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'woke', 'up', 'wanted', 'know', 'was', 'alive', 'dead', 'found', 'died', '5', 'days', 'mom', 'died', 'back', ""'95"", 'mom', 'birthday', 'Weird', 'series', 'events', 'there', 'When', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'Bewitched', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'strange', 'coincidence', 'was', 'supposed', 'watch', 'guess', 'not', 'Too', 'bad', 'movie', 'completely', 'mark', 'mean', '*completely*', 'must', 'avoid', ""'m"", 'still', 'shocked', 'final', 'note', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'movie', 'remakes', 'old', 'TV', 'shows', 'have', 'be', 'comparable', 'TV', 'show', 'extent', 'clearly', 'not', 'case', 'here']",N/A

The script and the direction of the movie fail to capture the audiences belief and their imagination....which is what a film based on ""magic"" and such a beloved series should do first and foremost.Kidman is charming in the role but she can only do so much. She just doesnt have anything solid to work with.Will Ferrell is terribly unfunny. We all know how hilarious he can be given the proper material......so chalk that one up to the movies script as well.By far the best performance of the film falls directly on the lap of Steve Carrell, who as Uncle Arthur is dead-on in his recreation and portrayal of the character originally played by the late Paul Lynde. Unfortunately, Carrell's screen time is seriously limited.The movie has it's small moments, but mostly they are few and far between.""Bewitched"" is worth seeing once.......but ultimately will go down as another failed adaptation that probably shouldn't have  been made in the first place.",3,"Not very ""Bewitching""",1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,1320,"['having', 'read', 'so', 'many', 'negative', 'reviews', 'comments', 'new', 'Bewitched', '..I', 'went', 'film', 'expecting', 'worst.The', 'good', 'news', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought.The', 'bad', 'news', 'Overall', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'film.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'Bewitched', 'Nora', 'Ephrons', 'ludicrous', 'script', 'so', 'many', 'directions', 'never', 'really', 'footing', 'script', 'direction', 'movie', 'fail', 'capture', 'audiences', 'belief', 'imagination', '.which', 'what', 'film', 'based', 'magic', 'beloved', 'series', 'should', 'do', 'first', 'foremost.Kidman', 'charming', 'role', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'just', 'doesnt', 'have', 'anything', 'solid', 'work', 'with.Will', 'Ferrell', 'terribly', 'unfunny', 'know', 'how', 'hilarious', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'proper', 'material', 'so', 'chalk', 'one', 'up', 'movies', 'script', 'well.By', 'far', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'directly', 'lap', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'who', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'dead-on', 'recreation', 'portrayal', 'character', 'originally', 'played', 'late', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Unfortunately', 'Carrell', 'screen', 'time', 'seriously', 'limited.The', 'movie', 'small', 'moments', 'mostly', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'Bewitched', 'worth', 'seeing', 'once', '.but', 'ultimately', 'will', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'failed', 'adaptation', 'probably', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'made', 'first', 'place']",N/A

168584,A3JPFWKS83R49V,1404974571,"Bryan Carey ""Bryan Carey""","[0, 3]","Bewitched was an old favorite among childhood television shows. I grew up enjoying it as an after- school rerun and when I heard there would be a movie version of the television show, I was anxious to give it a viewing and see if it would offer the same acting chemistry and overall spark that made the television series such an enjoyable one.What I discovered is that this movie, while a nice effort on the part of the director and others involved, isn't quite the blockbuster film I had hoped it would be. The main thing that I found different about this film is that, contrary to my expectations, it isn't a full- length film based on the television show. Rather, it is movie about a group of actors and actresses who are getting together to create a remake of the television show. This makes it different from the other remakes released this year (or in past years), but it also makes it unique. I didn't think I would like it at first, but I found that the director did a pretty good job assembling everything together and depicting the different actors and actresses in their respective roles.Nicole Kidman and Will Farrell are the main stars in this film, playing the parts of two people- Isabel Bigelow and Jack Wyatt- who are invited to play Samantha and Darren Stephens respectively. Wyatt already has the part as Darren and he discovers Isabel in a bookstore where he sees her twitching her nose- just like Samantha used to do on the television series. He offers her the job and she accepts. There is one twist to this, however: Isabel really is a witch and her father, played by Michael Caine, really is a warlock. When Kidman goes to audition for the part as Samantha and discovers that the character she is playing is a witch, she thinks her secret has been let out- that everyone knows she really is a witch. Her responses to the acting dialogue add some good humor to the film and she seems like the perfect choice of actresses to play her role.This movie is basically a romantic comedy, with Kidman pursuing Farrell hoping to establish a relationship with a mortal man so that she can live an ordinary mortal life. In this respect, the film is similar to the television show. Kidman's nave character isn't very similar and most of the other cast isn't much like the characters from the show (except for Michael Caine). But it still comes together pretty well in the end, making for a good but not great motion picture. It isn't the excellent film I had hoped for, but director Nora Ephron deserves some credit for creativity and for making the film work in spite of its differences when compared to most remakes.",3,"Bewitchingly Acceptable, but Nothing Special",1132012800,"11 15, 2005",2005,2629,"['Bewitched', 'was', 'old', 'favorite', 'childhood', 'television', 'shows', 'grew', 'up', 'enjoying', 'after-', 'school', 'rerun', 'when', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'movie', 'version', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'anxious', 'give', 'viewing', 'see', 'would', 'offer', 'same', 'acting', 'chemistry', 'overall', 'spark', 'made', 'television', 'series', 'enjoyable', 'one.What', 'discovered', 'movie', 'nice', 'effort', 'part', 'director', 'others', 'involved', ""n't"", 'quite', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'had', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'main', 'thing', 'found', 'different', 'film', 'contrary', 'expectations', ""n't"", 'full-', 'length', 'film', 'based', 'television', 'show', 'Rather', 'movie', 'group', 'actors', 'actresses', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'together', 'create', 'remake', 'television', 'show', 'different', 'other', 'remakes', 'released', 'year', 'past', 'years', 'also', 'unique', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'first', 'found', 'director', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'assembling', 'everything', 'together', 'depicting', 'different', 'actors', 'actresses', 'respective', 'roles.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'are', 'main', 'stars', 'film', 'playing', 'parts', 'two', 'people-', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'Jack', 'Wyatt-', 'who', 'are', 'invited', 'play', 'Samantha', 'Darren', 'Stephens', 'respectively', 'Wyatt', 'already', 'part', 'Darren', 'Isabel', 'bookstore', 'where', 'twitching', 'nose-', 'just', 'Samantha', 'used', 'do', 'television', 'series', 'job', 'one', 'twist', 'however', 'Isabel', 'really', 'witch', 'father', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'really', 'warlock', 'When', 'Kidman', 'audition', 'part', 'Samantha', 'discovers', 'character', 'playing', 'witch', 'secret', 'been', 'let', 'out-', 'everyone', 'really', 'witch', 'responses', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'add', 'good', 'humor', 'film', 'perfect', 'choice', 'actresses', 'play', 'role.This', 'movie', 'basically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Kidman', 'pursuing', 'Farrell', 'hoping', 'establish', 'relationship', 'mortal', 'man', 'can', 'live', 'ordinary', 'mortal', 'life', 'respect', 'film', 'similar', 'television', 'show', 'Kidman', 'nave', 'character', ""n't"", 'very', 'similar', 'most', 'other', 'cast', ""n't"", 'much', 'characters', 'show', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'still', 'together', 'pretty', 'well', 'end', 'making', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'motion', 'picture', ""n't"", 'excellent', 'film', 'had', 'hoped', 'director', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'credit', 'creativity', 'making', 'film', 'work', 'spite', 'differences', 'when', 'compared', 'most', 'remakes']",N/A

Will Ferrell plays a washed-up actor in the Darrin role, with Shirley MacLaine as the flashy, eccentric diva, tackling the role of Endora.Isabel Bigelow (Nicole Kidman) is a witch trying to live as best she can without the aid of her magical powers, much to the dismay of her warlock father (Michael Caine).  Thanks to her nose-twitching prowess, Isabel is cast as Samantha in a prospective new TV update of `Bewitched', with faded matinee idol Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) as Darrin.  Jack and Isabel immediately strike up their own special chemistry, and the filming of `Bewitched' sails along quite smoothly.  Until Isabel discovers he is using her to further his flagging career.  So she turns to her very own Aunt Clara (Carole Shelley), and places a powerful revenge spell over Jack.  But could love really happen between a witch and a mortal...?Screenwriters Delia and Nora Ephron have turned the coventional idea of the ""TV-to-Hollywood remake"" on it's head.  This remake is really a story-within-a-story, and that concept alone gives the film a freshness and the ability to be a little more flexible than your straightforward remake.Fantastic performances all around (Kidman is delightful as Isabel/Samantha, Ferrell is a comedic cut-up as the big-headed Jack and flustered Darrin; and Shirley MacLaine gives us the epitome of the glamorous diva in full force as Iris/Endora).  Kristin Chenoweth is a scene-stealer as Isabel's next-door-neighbour, and Carole Shelley is an Aunt Clara you'll adore.

I saw a Shirley MacLaine interview a couple of weeks ago. When the interviewer tried to ask her questions about Bewitched, she got a determined grimace on her face and instructed that Bewitched was done and over and that they should move on and discuss her new film. I wondered why she got a little snippy about it until I saw the film. Then, I fully understood. It is dreadful.I LOVED the original series Bewitched as a kid. Magical, charming, funny, great quirky characters. How you can take that show, suck out all its charm and turn it into such a yawnfest of a movie is beyond me. Nicole Kidman plays a simpering, absolutely dunderhead of a ""Samantha"" style character. Will Ferrell is not much better. But, neither are given anything to work with.

It wouldn't be so bad if they are releasing good remakes.  I mean, people don't like seeing shows that they love being destroyed on the big-screen.  So many Bewitched fans are going to be very angry.The basic premise of this movie is that ex-movie star Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell), wants to do a remake of the T.V. show ""Bewitched.""  The difference is that he wants Darrin to be the star of the show, not Samantha.  So Jack wants to cast a no-name actress to play Samantha, that way all of the attention will be on him.  Enter Isabel (Nicole Kidman), the new girl in town.  Wyatt sees her at a book store one day and immediately wants to cast her as Samantha.  Little does he know that Isabel is actually a witch.  Then she uses her magic powers to make some bad things happen and Jack and Isabel fall in love.  The end.Bewitched actually had a descent storyline.  A former movie star wants to be big again so he casts a no-name to be his co-star.  But then theres nothing after that.  It just turns into recycled garbage, that people call a love story.  The cast is good.  Nicole Kidman is dead-on as T.V.'s Samantha character.  She even has the nose wiggle down to perfection.  Will Ferrell does an okay job for not really having anything to work with.  The rest of the cast doesn't play an important enough part of the movie to even mention.  The main problem is that the story sucks and the movie is 2 hours long.  It is terribly boring and completely drawn out.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  You'll be bored out of your mind and you'll really be wishing that you had your ten bucks back.  If Nicole Kidman wasn't really cute, this movie would be unbearable.

You wait and see.(Well it probably won't because people are bored, stupid and keep paying to see the same old tired you already know what's gonna happen movies)Bewitched actually had a pretty creative idea. With a twist on the original series, it's centered around the things going on behind the scenes of the RECREATION of the classic show. In modern days, the show is being remade and Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) has already been cast as Darren. Then the search begins for the final and most important element. Who will play Samantha?Who can play one of the most famous witches of all time, short of the Wicked Witch of the West?  Well, how about a REAL WITCH?The premise is actually pretty creative.  The trouble is.  That's where the creativity STOPPED dead in its tracks.Take that premise and CUT and PASTE every single romantic comedy that has been made in the last few years on top of it, and you have your movie. Predictable. Movie scripting 101. Introduce characters/introduce premise/introduce dilemma/complicate dilemma/solve dilemma.This is why, I wish Hollywood would just collapse. Creativity is gone. Hollywood is been degraded to a sales pitch. Once the sales pitch is over and the paperwork is signed, they move in their robotic screenwriters to tell the exact same story they told in the last romantic comedy, only with different characters, in a different place and a different premise.I unfortunately took my girlfriend to go see this at the movie theatre.

168596,A3IY28PW12MSVN,1404974571,Christine Wong,"[3, 5]","First, a disclaimer: I've never seen an episode of ""Bewitched"" and I can't compare this movie to the show. I am reviewing the movie as it stands alone. That said, ""Bewitched"" is sometimes charming and entertaining, but it cannot sustain the conceit throughout its running time.Nicole Kidman plays Isabelle Bigolo, a witch who is trying to live a normal life (i.e. get by without using her magic), and who gets the role of Samantha on a ""Bewitched"" remake. Will Ferrell is Jack White, an egotistic, has-been actor who is trying to break back into the biz with a role as Darren. The running joke in the film is that life imitates art: Isabelle and the unknowing mortal Jack fall in love, just as Samantha and the knowing mortal Darren fall in love on the show. The problem with this film is that it can't sustain this idea and subsequently suffers from pacing problems after establishing this idea. The movie then becomes episodic, and while some of these episodes are charming (Isabelle and Jack's dinner date, Isabelle's talk with her father, the filming of the TV show), they feel too disconnected. The episodic structure of the movie therefore doesn't help the movie in terms of plot, but it does provide opportunity for good acting performances.Kidman is absolutely delightful in this movie: cheery, light, and charming. She can do the nose-twitch very well (although I obviously cannot compare it to Elizabeth Montgomery's, as I have never seen Bewitched the TV series) and is extremely likable as Samantha. She seems entirely relaxed in her role and wisely knows not to take herself or the movie seriously. Ferrell is his usual (somewhat) funny self, although he tends to stretch those laughs until his antics/histrionics aren't funny anymore. Michael Caine is excellent and lovable as ever as Samantha's dad - a caddish Cassanova of sorts. His ability to infuse wit, humor, charm, and childlike vigor (at the age of 72!) into his role is amusing and loads of fun to watch.I would only recommend this movie for fans of the actors/actresses involved and for people who don't mind the episodic nature (and somewhat poor pacing) of this movie.

I'm not saying there is anything at all substantial to the film, though, because there isn't.  It's complete fluff - but it's funny fluff.  Ferrell is his typically hilarious bumbling self, Shirley MacLaine seems to really enjoy the chance to ham it up as Endora, and Nicole Kidman is - well, she's Nicole Kidman.  I was as surprised as anyone when she took the role of the new Samantha, but she's quite good and as becoming as ever - although this part certainly offered her no challenges whatsoever.  Everyone in this film is good - except Steve Carell, who proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that we will never see the likes of Paul Lynde again (which is probably a good thing).I'm no fan of remakes, especially when so many of them are rather abysmal and usually leave me feeling quite offended on behalf of a show I have loved since I was a child.  You have to give the filmmakers of Bewitched a little credit, though, for taking a different approach to this particular remake.  They don't just recreate the original characters and give them an embarrassing script to run with, they do a film about recreating the original characters.  Nicole Kidman isn't Samantha at all, she's Isabel Bigelow, the woman who plays Samantha in the remake.  Of course, Isabel is herself a witch trying to live a normal life.  Will Ferrell isn't Darren; he's Jack Wyatt, the guy who plays Darren.  When Isabel and Jack fall for each other, it's the whole Samantha syndrome all over again.  The plot sounds rather weak, doesn't it?  I told you this was pure fluff.Ferrell gets most of the laughs as a formerly successful movie actor trying to bounce back from a movie bust of Ishtar proportions; he's your typical me-centric actor who cares only about himself.  If his move to TV in the form of the Bewitched remake falls through, he knows he's all but done in the business.  That's why he insists that a complete no-name star as Samantha, one who won't mind the fact that he's stealing all of the spotlights.  He thinks he finds just the woman in Isabel, who is in turn attracted to Jack because he's such an emotional mess (which is exactly what she is looking for in her quest to live a normal life) - but of course he has no idea he's dealing with a real witch.  The rest of the film is completely predictable, of course, and the Ferrell-Kidman matchup doesn't seem to have a whole heck of a lot of chemistry, but it's good, playful fun that doesn't try to be anything more than that.  Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine lend a fair amount of class to the act, but it's purely the comedy incorporated into the script that makes this movie go.The plot, besides being predictable, also has a few problems - I for one would never have given Isabel a real-life Aunt Clara, and the whole Uncle Arthur scene is just embarrassing to have to watch.  Ferrell's goofiness and Kidman's charm, though, prove strong enough to overcome the film's obvious faults.  As long as you go in expecting nothing more than some good laughs, Bewitched should not prove disappointing.",4,"Not particularly bewitching, but it is rather funny",1135555200,"12 26, 2005",2005,3294,"['Even', ""'m"", 'still', 'struggling', 'concept', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'getting', 'opportunity', 'romance', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'onscreen', 'being', 'paid', 'buckets', 'full', 'money', 'boot', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'Bewitched', 'more', 'thought', 'would', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'anything', 'substantial', 'film', 'though', ""n't"", 'complete', 'fluff', 'funny', 'fluff', 'Ferrell', 'typically', 'hilarious', 'bumbling', 'self', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'really', 'enjoy', 'chance', 'ham', 'up', 'Endora', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'well', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'as', 'surprised', 'anyone', 'when', 'took', 'role', 'new', 'Samantha', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'becoming', 'ever', 'part', 'certainly', 'offered', 'challenges', 'whatsoever', 'Everyone', 'film', 'good', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'who', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'likes', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'again', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', '.I', ""'m"", 'fan', 'remakes', 'especially', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'rather', 'abysmal', 'usually', 'leave', 'feeling', 'quite', 'offended', 'behalf', 'show', 'have', 'loved', 'was', 'child', 'have', 'give', 'filmmakers', 'Bewitched', 'little', 'credit', 'taking', 'different', 'approach', 'particular', 'remake', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'recreate', 'original', 'characters', 'give', 'embarrassing', 'script', 'run', 'do', 'film', 'recreating', 'original', 'characters', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', ""n't"", 'Samantha', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'woman', 'who', 'Samantha', 'remake', 'course', 'Isabel', 'witch', 'trying', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'Will', 'Ferrell', ""n't"", 'Darren', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'guy', 'who', 'Darren', 'When', 'Isabel', 'Jack', 'fall', 'other', 'whole', 'Samantha', 'syndrome', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'plot', 'rather', 'weak', ""n't"", 'told', 'was', 'pure', 'fluff.Ferrell', 'most', 'laughs', 'formerly', 'successful', 'movie', 'actor', 'trying', 'bounce', 'back', 'movie', 'bust', 'Ishtar', 'proportions', 'typical', 'me-centric', 'actor', 'who', 'only', 'move', 'TV', 'form', 'Bewitched', 'remake', 'done', 'business', 'why', 'complete', 'no-name', 'star', 'Samantha', 'one', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'mind', 'fact', 'stealing', 'spotlights', 'just', 'woman', 'Isabel', 'who', 'turn', 'attracted', 'Jack', 'such', 'emotional', 'mess', 'exactly', 'what', 'looking', 'quest', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'course', 'idea', 'dealing', 'real', 'witch', 'rest', 'film', 'completely', 'predictable', 'course', 'Ferrell-Kidman', 'matchup', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'whole', 'heck', 'lot', 'chemistry', 'good', 'playful', 'fun', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'lend', 'fair', 'amount', 'class', 'act', 'purely', 'comedy', 'incorporated', 'script', 'movie', 'go.The', 'plot', 'being', 'predictable', 'also', 'few', 'problems', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'given', 'Isabel', 'real-life', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'whole', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'scene', 'just', 'embarrassing', 'have', 'watch', 'Ferrell', 'goofiness', 'Kidman', 'charm', 'though', 'prove', 'strong', 'enough', 'overcome', 'film', 'obvious', 'faults', 'As', 'long', 'go', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'more', 'good', 'laughs', 'Bewitched', 'should', 'not', 'prove', 'disappointing']",N/A

That is until Ferrell finds Isabel that one fateful day in the bookstore, where she is wiggling her nose like the best of them.Enchanted, he begs Isabel to sign on to the show, using words like ""I need you"" to convince her. Having never been trained in the ways of the world, Isabel is overcome and agrees believing he is professing his love to her.But love doesn't come easily, for Ferrell is eager to get back in the publics good graces, and is consiquently blind to the lack of quality his character portrays in the overeagerness to believe himself one of the greats.Nicole is consiquently given parts only where she stands around, and never any dialouge in the attempt to make Ferrell seem bigger and better.

It is unfunny, pretentious, confusing and cliched.Bewitched concerns a failing actor (Ferrell) who looks to rejuvinate his career by starring in a remake of the old television series, Bewitched. Because the old series focused on the woman's role (Samantha, played by Elizabeth Montgomery), he wants to cast an unknown so that he can be the focus of the new series. He winds up casting Nicole Kidman's character because she is able to twitch her nose like Montgomery did. It turns out that Kidman is, herself, a witch in reality, who is, like the character Samantha, trying to escape the witchy-world and find love on Earth.Find that to be, well, ""stretching it"" a little? Yeah--it's that kind of movie.Along the way, we discover that another one of the actors in the film also happens to be a witch, though that plotline never gets resolved, and then we get to question reality altogether as Uncle Arthur, a character from the original television series, shows up inexplicably. While all of this could be zany and amusing, it really isn't because eventually, nothing makes sense. The thing that makes sense least of all is why anyone would fall in love with Ferrell's character, or how the movie makers could expect us to want Kidman to fall in love with him. Also, Ferrell and Kidman have (unsurprisingly) very little chemistry.While the movie isn't *all* bad (Carrell gives an awesome performance, and is quite memorable despite his short time on screen), it feels as though some executive somewhere decided he wanted to make a Bewitched movie, and then it was ""full steam ahead"" no matter what. No matter the fact that he wound up with a sub-par script that didn't really make a lick of sense.This movie is best avoided. Fans of the series should spend their time and money on collecting the series, which is available on DVD, too. Fans of Kidman and Ferrell will discover that both actors have made far superior films.

168611,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1404974571,Ed Uyeshima,"[12, 15]","Nothing irks me more than a blown opportunity for rejuvenating a fondly remembered sitcom that evokes instant nostalgia among baby-boomers but somehow misses the point of why the original show was so beloved. It appears director and co-writer Nora Ephron, along with her co-writer and sister Delia, got caught up in their own cleverness. They start with an only-in-Hollywood conceit, focusing the story on the effort to remake the ""Bewitched"" sitcom rather than trying to update the odd goings-on at the Stephens household for the new millennium. I applaud the originality of the concept, but the execution falls so flat that I was sighing at what should have been. There is some mild amusement with the show business sequences, such as the poolside negotiation, the auditions, the cartoon opening refocused completely on Darrin, and Samantha's on-set witchcraft. However, the love story, in particular, in the last half-hour, nosedives into predictability compounded by the lack of chemistry between the leads.An otherwise stellar cast has been set adrift. As Isabel Bigelow, a real witch tapped to play Samantha, Nicole Kidman is inarguably beautiful but oddly disjointed doing a breathy Meg Ryan impersonation. Kidman is an actress who depends on her fierce intelligence to maximize her effectiveness in roles, but she seems so preoccupied with being child-like and vulnerable that she often comes across as a graduate of a special education program. What she most lacks is the sense of bemused irony and saucy knowingness that Elizabeth Montgomery naturally brought to the role, but frankly that would have been an impossible task anyway. Will Ferrell steals the picture as fading star Jack Wyatt, but it's a petty crime at best. The character is such a complete jerk that one wonders whether Isabel just enjoys being a victim. While quite funny at times (especially as Isabel's witchcraft mangles his dinner scene on the sitcom set), there is an air of desperation in his antics as if he was the after-dinner entertainment on the Titanic.Standing in for Agnes Moorehead, Shirley MacLaine has a role that consists of a series of grand entrances and unfortunately due to the role-within-role she plays, there is not much for her to do besides some empty canoodling with Michael Caine, who plays Nigel, Isabel's erudite warlock father. In separate sequences that seem to function as pure nostalgia, Carole Shelley lacks Marion Lorne's genuine befuddlement as pixilated Aunt Clara, and Steve Carell does a merely adequate Paul Lynde as jokester Uncle Arthur. And the movie unforgivably wastes Amy Sedaris as nosy Gladys Kravitz. In new roles, helium-voiced Kristin Chenoweth fares better as Isabel's man-hungry neighbor Maria, as does Jason Schwartzman who captures the requisite oiliness of Jack's sycophant manager Ritchie.The 1960's sitcom was really not that great, just silly fun with a sharp cast, but this movie makes it seem as profound as Shakespeare. Scenes from the show's first episode are interjected to remind us of its legacy, and Montgomery`s Samantha is deified absurdly in an animated glossy. Watching this movie at a sneak preview among a sea of giggling children, I was overcome with the depressing feeling that this movie was hobbled together by committee driven by the studio's profitability demographic profile. Unlike an Alexander Payne or even a David O. Russell, Ephron simply does not provide any distinctive point of view here that could have made it more memorable. It could have been either a sharp post-feminist tract using witchcraft as a proxy for female empowerment or a social comedy about discrimination or mixed marriages. Instead, the film is a synthetic and forgettable waste of talent.

I used to watch Bewitched reruns back when they would be on Nick at Nite's Block Party summer years ago...  Loved it!  This movie was really cute.  I actually thought it was a movie version of the show, which in a way, it kind of was, but I was surprised when it wasn't.Will Ferrell is Jack Wyatt, a famous Hollywood actor whose career is on the fritz, so he decides to do a modernized remake of the television show Bewitched.  Jack figures that as long as the woman chosen to play Samantha is a new, unknown actress, his career will take off once again because the spotlight will be on him.  Enter Isabel (Nicole Kidman), a witch who decides she no longer wants to have the world at her fingertips and wants to give up her witch lifestyle.  She wants to lead a normal life by getting her own house, getting a job and making friends.  While Isabel is browsing the career guidance section at a bookstore, Jack spots her through a gap in a bookshelf just as she wiggles her nose in preparation for a sneeze.  He realizes she's perfect for the part and so he begins following her around.  Finally, one thing leads to another and he asks her to come for an audition.  She does so and lands the role of Samantha.Taping has only been going on for an episode and a half before Isabel realizes that her character has almost no lines in the show.  With the help of her Aunt Clara, Isabel and her friends put a hex on Jack.  Anyone who watched Bewitched will remember that Aunt Clara was never very good at hexes or spells.  She always messed them up!  As expected, the hex they put on Jack is too strong and so he is soon professing his love to Isabel.  Isabel, forgetting about the hex, begins to fall for Jack only to later remember that his feelings for her weren't real.  This is where Isabel calls upon her powers once again and rewinds time and undoes the hex.  She goes on to handle the situation without using her powers and things begin to look up for her career and for her relationship with Jack.Things are going so well that Isabel decides to tell Jack that she's a witch.  Once she does, Jack is frightened/alarmed by her and actually tries to ""shoo"" her away with a tree branch.  Feeling very hurt, Isabel packs up her things and prepares to return to her witch home.  Meanwhile, a visit from Uncle Arthur gets Jack to see things in a different light and so begins a frantic attempt at reconciliation before Isabel returns to her previous lifestyle from which she cannot come back for 100 years (according to Uncle Arthur).A happy ending follows, complete with a scene where Gladys Kravitz (Amy Sedaris) is peeking out her window, shouting to her husband Abner about the new neighbors and proceeds to pass out when she sees her neighbors once barren lawn become a beautiful flowery garden.Yes, the movie is predictable, but it's supposed to be!  I just really enjoyed it.  You don't need to think too hard, and I am thankful for movies like that.  If you enjoy a good romantic comedy, or you're a Will Ferrell or Nicole Kidman fan, you should see this movie.  Both are great in their roles!  Also, Shirley MacLaine is perfect for the role of Iris/Endora.  I remember the first time I saw her in a movie, Steel Magnolias, I thought to myself that she would make a perfect Endora.",5,Quite nice!,1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,3314,"['Bewitched', 'liked', 'movie', 'used', 'watch', 'Bewitched', 'reruns', 'back', 'when', 'would', 'be', 'Nick', 'Nite', 'Block', 'Party', 'summer', 'years', 'ago', 'Loved', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'cute', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'movie', 'version', 'show', 'way', 'kind', 'was', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', ""wasn't.Will"", 'Ferrell', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'famous', 'Hollywood', 'actor', 'career', 'fritz', 'do', 'modernized', 'remake', 'television', 'show', 'Bewitched', 'Jack', 'as', 'long', 'woman', 'chosen', 'play', 'Samantha', 'new', 'unknown', 'actress', 'career', 'will', 'take', 'off', 'once', 'again', 'spotlight', 'will', 'be', 'Enter', 'Isabel', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'witch', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'world', 'fingertips', 'give', 'up', 'witch', 'lifestyle', 'lead', 'normal', 'life', 'getting', 'own', 'house', 'getting', 'job', 'making', 'friends', 'Isabel', 'browsing', 'career', 'guidance', 'section', 'bookstore', 'Jack', 'spots', 'gap', 'bookshelf', 'just', 'nose', 'preparation', 'sneeze', 'perfect', 'part', 'so', 'following', 'around', 'Finally', 'one', 'thing', 'come', 'audition', 'so', 'role', 'Samantha.Taping', 'only', 'been', 'going', 'episode', 'half', 'Isabel', 'character', 'almost', 'lines', 'show', 'help', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'Isabel', 'friends', 'put', 'hex', 'Jack', 'Anyone', 'who', 'watched', 'Bewitched', 'will', 'remember', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'was', 'never', 'very', 'good', 'hexes', 'spells', 'always', 'messed', 'up', 'expected', 'hex', 'put', 'Jack', 'too', 'strong', 'so', 'soon', 'professing', 'love', 'Isabel', 'Isabel', 'forgetting', 'hex', 'fall', 'Jack', 'only', 'later', 'remember', 'feelings', 'were', ""n't"", 'real', 'where', 'Isabel', 'powers', 'once', 'again', 'time', 'hex', 'handle', 'situation', 'using', 'powers', 'things', 'begin', 'look', 'up', 'career', 'relationship', 'Jack.Things', 'are', 'going', 'so', 'well', 'Isabel', 'tell', 'Jack', 'witch', 'Jack', 'frightened/alarmed', 'actually', 'shoo', 'away', 'tree', 'branch', 'Feeling', 'very', 'hurt', 'Isabel', 'up', 'things', 'prepares', 'return', 'witch', 'home', 'Meanwhile', 'visit', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'Jack', 'see', 'things', 'different', 'light', 'so', 'frantic', 'attempt', 'reconciliation', 'Isabel', 'returns', 'previous', 'lifestyle', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'back', '100', 'years', 'according', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', '.A', 'happy', 'ending', 'complete', 'scene', 'where', 'Gladys', 'Kravitz', 'Amy', 'Sedaris', 'peeking', 'out', 'window', 'shouting', 'husband', 'Abner', 'new', 'neighbors', 'proceeds', 'pass', 'out', 'when', 'neighbors', 'once', 'barren', 'lawn', 'become', 'beautiful', 'flowery', 'garden.Yes', 'movie', 'predictable', 'supposed', 'be', 'just', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'am', 'thankful', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'good', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'re"", 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'fan', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'are', 'great', 'roles', 'Also', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'perfect', 'role', 'Iris/Endora', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'movie', 'Steel', 'Magnolias', 'thought', 'myself', 'would', 'make', 'perfect', 'Endora']",N/A

Will, well I have only seen him on SNL and Superstar. Other actors have amazed me before. One movie they are duds and anothr movie they are superb!!!  Being a huge Bewitched fan, I will most defitatly give this mmovie a try to see what other ways the story can go. Of course nothing will take the place of the TV series!!!

Hollywood decides to milk it for its film potential (what with Hollywood being creatively bankrupt, this is no big surprise). The result - pure disaster!Why?Let me count the ways.....The film is about how a studio is remaking ""Bewitched"" the television series, but they make Darrin the focus instead of Samantha. The lame actor playing Darrin casts an unknown for Samantha, but little does he know she (Nicole Kidman) is really a witch who only wants to be normal (just like the Samantha from the original television series). Now this unknown has never heard of Bewitched or Samantha (in the movie Kidman's character's name is Isabelle).See how clever this is? Not!Now, Isabelle has never heard about Bewitched before, yet she has a dotty old Aunt Clara who carries door knobs around in her pocket book (just like Aunt Clara on the old TV series). Bizarro world, huh?And Isabelle has an eccentric Uncle Arthur just like the television series...(Fortunately he only shows up at the end of the film in order to completely finish it off).Isabelle doesn't have a mother in the picture - only her father (Michael Caine, who sleep walks through his sad role). What about Endora you ask?Well, Shirley MaClain plays Endora - only she is really playing an actress named Iris, who is playing Endora in the television series. Or is she just that?Where's Dr. Bombay? What about Serina? Where's the witches council?I'm sure that the producers thought this film might spark off a sequel. I sure hope not. This first film is so horrible it could turn people off to the charming television series from the 60's.Michael Caine's ""Daddy"" keeps popping up on frozen food cartons and jars of dressing. In the television series, Maurice Evans' Daddy was a dignified Shakespeare quoting gentleman. Here, he is an Uncle Arthur knock off - which is weird since the producers bring in ""uncle Arthur"" later in the film.Endora, as a character in the new television series, played by Iris something or other (actually played by MacClaine) is a ham actress of former fame, who may or may not really be a witch (although she doesn't know Isabelle). She's a joke - and not a funny one. Agnes Moorehead's Endora was never a joke.The original television series succeeded so well, because the characters were clearly defined. It was very loosely based on the 1940's Veronica Lake film, ""I Married a Witch"". 1960's Bewitched used popular actors for the leads, but filled the supporting roles with well known, tried and true, well trained, dignified, and award winning character actors, like Agnes Moorehead - ""Mother/Endora"" (four times nominated for Academy Award), Maurice Evans -  ""Daddy""(Tony award winning Shakespearean stage actor), Marion Lorne (a fine radio actress), David White as Larry Tate (a reknowned stage actor);Estelle Winwood and Reta Shaw (character actors extrordinaire); Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay); and Paul Lynde (Uncle Arthur).It's a shame that the actors of merit in this film (Kidman, Caine, and MacClaine) are all wasted and play second fiddle to pitiful writing and sad direction and editing.I really can't imagine a more horrible re-visioning of the charming 1960's television series.This film doesn't deserve to even be associated with the name of that original series.",1,"Dr Bombay, Dr. Bombay!

Nicole Kidman is PERFECT, not just in her looks and nose twitch, but in the personality she exudes of a non-actress witch (Isabel) playing Samantha in the TV show remake.  Director Nora Ephron also brings out the almost-but-not-quite-shy idealistic girl-next-door quality from Kidman that she got so perfectly from Meg Ryan in their films together.  And the ""story-within-a-story"" approach is better than trying to do a direct portrayal.That said, the movie does have a core problem to it that Ephron's other two smash romantic comedies -- 'Sleepless in Seattle' and 'You've Got Mail' -- did not have: It's really hard to like the lead male character for a lengthy portion of the film.  Will Farrell is HILARIOUS and does a terrific job playing the insecure, self-centered, and needy actor Jack Wyatt, but he's so overly pathetic for so long that it gets to be tiresome and annoying to watch him, rather than charming.  In 'Sleepless' and 'Mail', you get to know AND LIKE both lead characters even as you understand their differences, and the charm comes in watching them overcome the obstacles between them.  But in 'Bewitched', the only true obstacle between them is Wyatt's ongoing childish insecurity.  That insecurity is heightened and used by his smarmy agent, played well by Jason Schwartzman, but it simply takes a little too long for him to get his act together and go after the girl sincerely.Still, there's a lot of funny and clever material here -- a lot of it on the lips of Michael Caine, father of Isabel and self-styled ladies man who meets his match in Shirley Maclaine, an actress/witch named Iris who portrays 'Andora' on the show.  Also, Kidman shows a serious talent for comedy that I hope we'll see more of in the future.  And look for other fun from Steve Correll ('The 40-Year-Old Virgin') as Uncle Arthur, and Steven Colbert, now of 'The Colbert Report' on Comedy Central.Overall, Bewitched is a very good time, definitely worth seeing, and maybe even worth adding to your collection.

Why doesn't Hollywood use the original actors of the tv series for the motion picture?With this remake, ""Bewitched"", the idea comes from the original tv series, ""Bewitched"" (1964-72) and its spin-off ""Tabitha"" (1977-78).The original cast of ""Bewitched"" have all passed away to those stars in the sky. However, Alice Ghostley, Erin Murphy and Diane Murphy, David Lawerence and Greg Lawerence, and Kasey Rogers are still with us.The word-of-mouth about this film was disappointing even before the filming was finished.  We knew it was going to be bad.it was not a remake exactly like the ""Bewitched"" tv series, but about actors who are hired to do a tv series ""Bewitched"" however, the female lead really is a witch.Casting Ideas: I would NOT have chosen Nicole Kidman and Will Farrell.  If Elizabeth Montgomery were still with us, cast her in a heartbeat.  I would have chosen Chris Parnell as ""Darrin"" and Betty White as ""Aunt Clara"".I will add that it was nice to see Carole Shelley in the role of ""Aunt Clara"", who I have not seen since her role in the film, The Odd Couple (1968).Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine were a wise choice too.Still, I would have preferred a retro ""Bewitched"" film set in the original living room set with the original characters.

I would have walked out but I got in free with a ticket I got from purchasing the TV show DVD box set.  The plot was ridiculously bad. They're going to remake the old Bewitched series. Nicole's character is really a witch with witch family members just like Samantha. Can you say STUPID?! I bet Nicole wished she hadn't done this. The script was a monstrosity.  I'm not going to go on and on about the problems with the script. You may read other reviews giving it one star.I  bet younger people probably gave it a lot of stars. We, oldies, who grew up with the show despised it.  I would guess.  People called the script original and not just revisiting the show. It still made no sense.Why couldn't they just have modernized it and had Samantha be in the workforce, not be so submissive to Darrin and used her powers more.  Maybe they got a divorce because of her magic and gotten back together. Maybe they are older and dealing with Tabitha's magic. I know there was a show about Tabatha so maybe not.I read that Jim Carry refused it and wisely so.  I like Will Ferrell but nothing could save this mess of a movie.  The whole cast is wasted. Shirley McClaine took the role because she always wanted to be magic.  She wasn't a fan of the show.  She has got to have hated this after she did this movie.I love Kristen Chenowith, wasted.

It was an idea that was perfectly suited to the era -- a woman with special ""powers,"" being allegedly suppressed by marriage and the man she loves. Perfect for the girls who grew up to read Ms Magazine and dabble in (some of us, anyway) things of a spiritual and empowering nature.Years later, along comes a re-make (but really much more) of that same show, with so much more added. Sorry for the fans of Bewitched who were expecting a line-by-line recreation of the TV show, because this just isn't it. There are wonderful references, but this is not a re-make. This time we explore the adventures of a real witch, who is attempting to suppress her own special ""powers"" to experience life from a more ordinary viewpoint. Just like the original, however, the witchey-woman comes into her own, no matter what the circumstances around her. The way she stumbles into portraying Samantha on Bewitched is adorable!I love this movie so much. The comedy, the romance, the music -- it had it all, as far as I was concerned!

Well, I'm not going to disagree too much with what any of those 1 star folks had to say, but I'm going to be a little kinder, not much, but a little.....2 stars. Why 2 you say, well, Will Ferrell tries so hard to make this work, that he actually squeezed a couple of chuckles from me. I can't be so kind with the rest of the cast, especially (and this really hurts me to say cuz she is one of my favorite's) Nicole Kidman is just awful in this (scuze' me whilst i wipe away a tear) Easily one of the best actresses in recent years, just fell flat on her gorgeous booty.I find it really hard to fathom that the same lady that torched the screen in Dogville, Human Stain, and Birth, can be so non-interested in a role. Its like half way through making this she realized ""what the hell am i doing? this is way beneath me"" and then just pretty much sleepwalked her way through the rest of it. Shirley McClaine stars and also dissapoints, no effort really made on her part to add a few laughs as you know who.Back to Will Ferrell, a very talented funny man who needs to be a little more selective with the roles he chooses. Old School was ok, but Ferrell was excellent, Elf was cute, but Ferrell really sold that movie for me. Then he comes out with Kicking and Screaming. and lets just say unless your 10, you ain't screaming to many nice things about this movie.

I had low expectations this movie and I was surprised how much I liked it. Nicole Kidman is a good reason to give the movie a chance. She's adorable as a naive witch who just wants to live a normal life. She meets Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell), a movie star who's career went down hill. So now his agent got him a job to play Darren in a new Bewitched tv series.He wants her to play Samantha just because she can wiggle her nose. Since he will make the show just about Darren, he doesn't care if she can act. She won't even have any lines. She likes him but once she realizes that she's just being used, she gets angry and starts putting spells on him. She makes him mess up his lines which was done better on Bruce Almighty. Here it's not that funny because Ferrell is not that funny here. All he has going for him in Bewitched is chemestry with Kidman, he's not that likeable or funny. When he's told by Kidman  that she's a witch he says ""I'm a Clippers fan"". I doubt anyone found that hilarious or even funny. Kidman has funnier scenes with Michael Caine as her father. As he appears in the most unlikely places to hold a conversation with her. Like he disguises himself as the green giant while she's trying to shop for food. Jason Schwartzman (Shop Girl, Rushmore) is also entertaining as Ferrell's over protective agent.Nicole Kidman is the one who really holds the movie together though and makes you want to see where it goes. She did two remake comedies in a row and is too good of an actress to be wasted in remakes though. What's next, the Flying Nun ? She's good here but she's above this.

Thanks for providing the laugh, especially the guy who had to remind us who Nicole Kidman is! That's great!!!Will Ferrell makes this film salvageable. There, I wrote it. It's not entirely great - far from it - and it's not entirely bad. I laughed a great deal, as did my family. We did, oddly enough, comprise of about 15% of the laughing masses in the theatre, though. This begs the question, have Americans lost their sense of friggin humor or is this just a case of GROUP LAUGH GONE AWRY - you know, when you know something is funny but you find yourself surrounded by stiffs who refuse to laugh, thus minimizing your own laugh as you fall victim to Peer Pressure Non-Laughter, or PPNL, as the doctors on the second floor call it.Oh, you want plot? Do you really? If you do, please seek mental help ASAP. It's a funny movie about a real life witch who falls for an actor who thinks she's pretending to be a witch. Ferrell is funny. When hasn't he been funny. He's not hilarious, but he is funny, and thus, is worth going to see as opposed to you sitting at home and watching HGTV or Law and Order reruns for the 40th time this week.One last factual note: the writers of this screenplay are practicing witches. One of them, a friend of Church of Satan priest Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails said, ""We want to lull them to sleep with our Satanic agenda.

This is not a film version of the popular television show.  Instead it is a movie about remaking the show as a new series.  Will Ferrell (the one weak point in the casting) is an actor in need of a break after some bad ratings.  His agent has convinced him to take the part of Darren in a new television show.  All that is needed is a co-star who can twitch her nose.  Enter Nicole Kidman.Kidman is really a witch trying to blend into the mortal world despite the interference of her father (Michael Caine).  Soon the show is in production and Kidman learns the truth about her role and her co-star.  Ferrell, meanwhile, begins to have doubts about the show when he realizes no one liked Darren originally.  Add a famous actress played by Shirley MacLane being cast as Endora and a handful of other supporting characters (including a neighbor who makes Kidman look like a giant) and you get a nicely complex story that pays tribute to the original instead of trying to remake it.I really liked this one more than I thought I would.  Kidman is a delight and MacLane and Caine are wonderful.  This really is a tribute to the original show and not just a film trying to redo something proven as successful.  Fans of the original should not worry that their beloved show is ruined.  Good tribute, great acting (except Ferrell), and a well-thought-out plot make for a funny and original film.

I didn't know until I began watching the movie that it was told in a slightly different way then the past remakes like ""Starsky & Hutch"" and ""Charlies Angels"". This movie doesn't follow the same characters through a series of sitcomish events. This movie is instead about actors remaking ""Bewitched"" into a brand new television show. It's an interesting idea and works pretty well. However, writers Nora & Delia Ephron made one big mistake that, for the most part, decided the fate of the movie. A lot of the jokes in the movie are very much like an old 70's sitcom jokes, which is a huge problem...Because they're not funny. But, don't get me wrong, this movie can be funny. Some of the jokes are hits, I especially liked the short scene between Will Ferrell and the waitress involving ""hummas"".But, anyway, Ferrell plays Jack Wyatt, a down-and-out actor who's last two films bombed and who's marriage recently ended. Then Jack's sleazy manager (Jason Schwartzman) manages to get him a job on the remake of the television show ""Bewitched"". Jack, in a scheme to bring his career back to life, suggests casting an unknown actress when he runs into Isabell (Nicole Kidman, who's pretty damn good in the role). In a strange turn of events, Isabell is an actual witch and for a while completely oblivious to Jack's plan.When, she finds out what Jack is really up to though she turns the tables on him. This movie definitley gives Ferrell a chance to show off his knack for physical comedy, most notably in the scene with the dog. There's also a sub plot in the movie involving Isabell's father Nigel (Michael Caine) falls for Iris Smythson (Shirley McClaine) the actress playing Endora. Steve Carell also is perfectly cast in a short cameo as Uncle Arthur. So, as I said...It's not a perfect movie and it's not particularly funny but it's worth watching.

168651,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,1404974571,- Kasia S.,"[3, 10]","Against anything I could have expected Bewitched was a wonderful, satisfying, make you feel good movie that just happened to be on TV on Monday night. I have always loved the original show ever since I was young, scheduling my nights to Nick at Night, gobbling up Samantha Stevens and her poor husband Darren, who had the best time in their lives, even though she was a witch and her tricks seemed to back fire all the time.Now this movie is not exactly as you would think. I had no idea of the premise when it started and I was really surprised by the refreshing twist; actors who were making a remake of the show, who had no idea that Samantha the character would have a real life witch plating a witch on TV. Nicole Kidman, never my favorite before, gave a delightful performance as charming Isabel Bigelow who disarmed Jack Wyatt, played by Will Farrell of all the people, and watched him turn from a spoiled TV star to a bum of all jokes, just like the Samantha and Darren we all know from the show.Jack was the star of the show, on the lookout for his perfect Samantha, someone who can twitch her nose but more important and unknown woman who will not outshine him at his own show. He found the quiet, gentle and sweet Isabel, unknowns that she can have a cranky temper and who will make him sweat while his ridiculous star demands arose. The quarrels produced by the duo surpassed all that I could have hoped for. I laugh so many times I almost fell of the bed and let me tell you, there wasn't one moment where the momentum wasn't in full swing as this was the perfect romantic comedy even if you don't like them. I know they are one of my least favorite types of movie to watch yet this grabbed my heart and filled it with much joy. The best part was the fact that Jack had no idea she was a real witch, and she took full advantage of her magic on that fact. She made him speak in funny voices on the set in different languages, miss his cues, spoiled his lines, and played tricks on his ex-wife. That was only the beginning, before she got mad. . I enjoyed watching the movie revolve around plot's twist and turns form the turbulent moments in the beginning to smooth sailing and then dark skies ahead. The more Jack got involved with Isabel the less truth he knew. The day she started to fall for him was the day she knew she was in trouble. I knew that the real Bewitched story would unravel just like original show, this time following real life Isabel and Jack.I know I would have never watched this on my own, and that's why I felt a little bad after seeing it, since it made me feel so free and happy. Bewitched was a full of colors and jokes, tricks and magical spells, friends who turned on each other and who made up, spoiled movie starts who got their composure back and of a witch who always wanted to be loved and who really started her own crusade for that goal. This is a real fun flick to watch with someone you love or even with your favorite kitty, and be prepared for some fun times and sparkling charm to pour out of the screen.I don't care if this is not the coolest movie ever made, I enjoyed it and I'm proud of it, after all that's the point of movies, they should make the viewer feel good and this sure fit the bill.- Kasia S.",5,"Bubbly, light and refreshing",1156723200,"08 28, 2006",2006,3261,"['anything', 'could', 'have', 'expected', 'Bewitched', 'was', 'wonderful', 'satisfying', 'make', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'TV', 'Monday', 'night', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'original', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'young', 'scheduling', 'nights', 'Nick', 'Night', 'gobbling', 'up', 'Samantha', 'Stevens', 'poor', 'husband', 'Darren', 'who', 'had', 'best', 'time', 'lives', 'even', 'was', 'witch', 'tricks', 'seemed', 'back', 'fire', 'time.Now', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'would', 'think', 'had', 'idea', 'premise', 'when', 'started', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'refreshing', 'twist', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'making', 'remake', 'show', 'who', 'had', 'idea', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'witch', 'plating', 'witch', 'TV', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'never', 'favorite', 'before', 'gave', 'delightful', 'performance', 'charming', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'who', 'disarmed', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'played', 'Will', 'Farrell', 'people', 'watched', 'turn', 'spoiled', 'TV', 'star', 'bum', 'jokes', 'just', 'Samantha', 'Darren', 'know', 'show.Jack', 'was', 'star', 'show', 'lookout', 'perfect', 'Samantha', 'someone', 'who', 'can', 'twitch', 'nose', 'more', 'important', 'unknown', 'woman', 'who', 'will', 'not', 'outshine', 'own', 'show', 'found', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'sweet', 'Isabel', 'can', 'have', 'cranky', 'temper', 'who', 'will', 'make', 'sweat', 'ridiculous', 'star', 'demands', 'arose', 'quarrels', 'produced', 'duo', 'surpassed', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'laugh', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'almost', 'fell', 'bed', 'let', 'tell', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'moment', 'where', 'momentum', 'was', ""n't"", 'full', 'swing', 'was', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'know', 'are', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'types', 'movie', 'watch', 'yet', 'grabbed', 'heart', 'filled', 'much', 'joy', 'best', 'part', 'was', 'fact', 'Jack', 'had', 'idea', 'was', 'real', 'witch', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'magic', 'fact', 'made', 'speak', 'funny', 'voices', 'set', 'different', 'languages', 'miss', 'cues', 'spoiled', 'lines', 'played', 'tricks', 'ex-wife', 'was', 'only', 'beginning', 'got', 'mad', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'movie', 'revolve', 'plot', 'twist', 'form', 'turbulent', 'moments', 'beginning', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'then', 'dark', 'skies', 'ahead', 'more', 'Jack', 'got', 'involved', 'Isabel', 'less', 'truth', 'knew', 'day', 'started', 'fall', 'was', 'day', 'knew', 'was', 'trouble', 'knew', 'real', 'Bewitched', 'story', 'would', 'unravel', 'just', 'original', 'show', 'time', 'following', 'real', 'life', 'Isabel', 'Jack.I', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'own', 'why', 'felt', 'little', 'bad', 'seeing', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'free', 'happy', 'Bewitched', 'was', 'full', 'colors', 'jokes', 'tricks', 'magical', 'spells', 'friends', 'who', 'turned', 'other', 'who', 'made', 'up', 'spoiled', 'movie', 'starts', 'who', 'got', 'composure', 'back', 'witch', 'who', 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'loved', 'who', 'really', 'started', 'own', 'crusade', 'goal', 'real', 'fun', 'flick', 'watch', 'someone', 'love', 'even', 'favorite', 'kitty', 'be', 'prepared', 'fun', 'times', 'sparkling', 'charm', 'pour', 'screen.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'coolest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'enjoyed', ""'m"", 'proud', 'point', 'movies', 'should', 'make', 'viewer', 'feel', 'good', 'sure', 'bill.-', 'Kasia', 'S']",N/A

After a spell is cast upon Jack where he falls madly in love with Isabel, she realizes that true love must be real, and she removes the spell.I'm sure you can all figure out what happens next with Jack and Isabel.

168657,AATS9Q7VJ4PFI,1404974571,Kevin R. Austra,"[4, 7]","BEWITCHED is a very pleasant movie.  Movie versions of television shows normally do not adapt well to the big screen, but this one did a fair job.  If you did not grow up watching the original ""Bewitched"" -- or follow the syndicated reruns -- then you would miss half the fun in this film.This movie initially took me by surprise.  The original teasers in the movie theater gave me the impression that this was going to simply be a remake of ""Bewitched.""  It is a little more complicated than that.  In the film, Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell's characters are actors who in turn set out to play the parts of Samantha and Darrin Stevens in a revival of the old television series.  Surprise, suprise ... Kidman's Isabel Bigelow is actually a witch.  Ferrell's Jack Wyatt is Isabel's conceited co-star.  With a little help from Isabel, Jack overcomes his ego and falls in love with Isabel.  Can Jack accept the fact that Isabel is really a witch?  You will have to watch the movie to find out, though this debacle was similarly solved in the initial episode of the original ""Bewitched"" television series.BEWITCHED does not need this extra layer of story.  It would have been much better for Kidman to simply play Samantha and Ferrell to play Darrin.  Michael Caine does a superb job as Isabel's warlock father Nigel Bigelow.  He could very easily have been Samantha's father Maurice.  Caine's scenes in the supermarket are wonderful.  Unfortunately the movie within a movie format of this film prevents him from playing his part to full effect.Speaking of full effect, Shirley MacLaine is absolutely the modern version of Endora.  Oh, she is also playing the part of an actress playing the part of a witch.  By the way, she is also a real witch.  No doubt numerous comic opportunities were lost with the superfluous story.  In the original series, Endora was Darrin's nemesis in most of the episodes.  In this movie she is not actually Endora so there are no mother-in-law confrontations and spiteful spells.  MacLaine's brief appearances as Endora are stunning.Just when you finally accept that fact that Kidman and Ferrell are not really Samantha and Darrin, we discover that Isabel coincidentally has an inept Aunt Clara.  At other junctures Uncle Arthur and nosy neighbor Gladys and her husband Abner appear.  After all the effort to impress us that this film is not a remake of ""Bewitched,"" the introduction of these familiar characters outside of the film within a film is confusing.As I noted earlier, it would have been much better to have launched this film with Kidman and Ferrell as Samantha and Darrin.There are some truly funny bits in this film.  At times Will Ferrell acts very much like his childish character in ELF.  Although I do recommend that you get this DVD, I gave the film three stars because of the unnecessary and distracting film within a film genre.",3,"Funny, Nostolgic, Unnecessary Complications",1130371200,"10 27, 2005",2005,2876,"['BEWITCHED', 'very', 'pleasant', 'movie', 'Movie', 'versions', 'television', 'shows', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'adapt', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'did', 'fair', 'job', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'watching', 'original', 'Bewitched', 'follow', 'syndicated', 'reruns', 'then', 'would', 'miss', 'fun', 'film.This', 'movie', 'initially', 'took', 'surprise', 'original', 'teasers', 'movie', 'theater', 'gave', 'impression', 'was', 'going', 'simply', 'be', 'remake', 'Bewitched', 'little', 'more', 'complicated', 'film', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'characters', 'are', 'actors', 'who', 'turn', 'set', 'out', 'play', 'parts', 'Samantha', 'Darrin', 'Stevens', 'revival', 'old', 'television', 'series', 'Surprise', 'suprise', 'Kidman', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'actually', 'witch', 'Ferrell', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'Isabel', 'conceited', 'co-star', 'little', 'help', 'Isabel', 'Jack', 'ego', 'love', 'Isabel', 'Can', 'Jack', 'accept', 'fact', 'Isabel', 'really', 'witch', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'find', 'out', 'debacle', 'was', 'similarly', 'solved', 'initial', 'episode', 'original', 'Bewitched', 'television', 'series.BEWITCHED', 'not', 'need', 'extra', 'layer', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'Kidman', 'simply', 'play', 'Samantha', 'Ferrell', 'play', 'Darrin', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'superb', 'job', 'Isabel', 'warlock', 'father', 'Nigel', 'Bigelow', 'could', 'very', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'Samantha', 'father', 'Maurice', 'Caine', 'scenes', 'supermarket', 'are', 'wonderful', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'movie', 'format', 'film', 'playing', 'part', 'full', 'effect.Speaking', 'full', 'effect', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'absolutely', 'modern', 'version', 'Endora', 'Oh', 'also', 'playing', 'part', 'actress', 'playing', 'part', 'witch', 'way', 'also', 'real', 'witch', 'doubt', 'numerous', 'comic', 'opportunities', 'were', 'lost', 'superfluous', 'story', 'original', 'series', 'Endora', 'was', 'Darrin', 'nemesis', 'most', 'episodes', 'movie', 'not', 'actually', 'Endora', 'are', 'mother-in-law', 'confrontations', 'spiteful', 'spells', 'MacLaine', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Endora', 'are', 'stunning.Just', 'when', 'finally', 'accept', 'fact', 'Kidman', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'Samantha', 'Darrin', 'discover', 'Isabel', 'coincidentally', 'inept', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'other', 'junctures', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'nosy', 'neighbor', 'Gladys', 'husband', 'Abner', 'appear', 'effort', 'impress', 'film', 'not', 'remake', 'Bewitched', 'introduction', 'familiar', 'characters', 'film', 'film', 'confusing.As', 'noted', 'earlier', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'have', 'launched', 'film', 'Kidman', 'Ferrell', 'Samantha', 'Darrin.There', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'bits', 'film', 'times', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'very', 'much', 'childish', 'character', 'ELF', 'do', 'recommend', 'get', 'DVD', 'gave', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'film', 'film', 'genre']",N/A

168661,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1404974571,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 2]","Nicole Kidman is cute, Will Farrell is funny, and Nora Ephron wrote this movie (along with her sister, Delia), so it is rather surprising that ""Bewitched"" does not work anywhere near as well as it should.  They could have simply taken the concept from the classic 1960s situation comedy and translated it to the silver screen, but Ephron had what she thought was a better idea.  This would be a movie about the attempt to remake ""Bewitched"" as a television show, which would star the struggling actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) as Darren.  He demands a complete unknown to play Samantha, and discovers that Isabel Bigelow (Kidman) can twitch her nose.  He figures she is perfect for the role, but does not know that she really is perfect because she really is a witch.  This might be more irony than mere mortals can endure, but it is a different bit of a twist.The problem is that the character of Wyatt is the only person on the face of the Earth who does not know that the Samantha character is the star of ""Bewitched.""  Now, the idea that somebody who want to remake ""Bewitched"" but have the show focus on Darren instead of Samantha is a nice little joke, but like Steve Martin's gag about cat juggling it is not as funny when you actually try to show it.  We also have to pretend that everybody producing and working on this show are content to let it all be about Darren, which is really taking the joke way too far.  This leads us to the second part of the problem, which is that when we get to the romantic part of this romantic comedy it is more believable when Isabel tugs on her ear (real witches are like Carol Burnett apparently) then when we get to the point where Jack has a change of heart, brain, and probably several other body parts as well.  There is even a scene where Jack is talked into believing that what has happened was his own idea, which I think was an attempt by Ephron to convince us as well.When Isabel's Aunt Clara (Carole Shelley) shows up and is a lot like Samantha's Aunt Clara, whatever Ephron is trying to put together collapses.  My best guess is that there is something meta-critical going on here, but I still have not worked out what it would be in any way that would make sense.  By the time Uncle Arthur (Steve Carell) shows up, so to speak, I figure it is just because they are trying to touch all the bases, which means Gladys and Abner cannot be far behind (and they are not).  Still, I am haunted by the idea that Ephron was trying to come up with something that worked on several levels and that I cannot tell what she was going for before all those levels collapsed bothers me, especially because I would have bet Ephron was capable of carrying something like that out.Much has been made of Kidman's breathy speaking voice in this film but I did not find it bothersome and thought she was cute without becoming kewpie doll cute ala Marilyn Monroe or Betty Boop.  The idea of having Isabel's main relationship be with her father, Nigel (Michael Caine), made for a nice contrast with Samantha's relationship with Endora, and the casting of Shirley MacLaine as the actress who plays Endora was perfect, because it reminds us that Agnes Moorehead was in MacLaine's league, the same way that Montgomery and Kidman are on the same level.  This 2005 comedy certainly acknowledges the affection people have for ""Bewitched"" in general and Elizabeth Montgomery in particular.  I especially liked that the clips from the television series were all from the early black & white period before the show got a bit silly, because that was when Montgomery was at her best.

168662,A1L43KWWR05PCS,1404974571,Lawyeraau,"[1, 4]","This is a take-off of the popular television sit-com, ""Bewitched"", that originally starred the adorable Elizabeth Montgomery as a witch, Samantha Stevens, who is married to a mere mortal, Darrin Stevens, played by Dick York. The television show was a huge hit, and not even the eventual replacement of Dick York with another actor in the role of the husband made it lose any ground with its devoted audience.So, I looked forward to seeing this film, which, to its credit, tries to give the original premise a fresh look. So, the film is actually about a re-make of the original sit-com, with funny man Will Ferrell playing the part of Jack Wyatt, a down on his luck actor looking to give his faltering career a boost. When he is offered a chance to play the part of Darrin Stevens in a television re-make of ""Bewitched"", he leaps at the opportunity, on the condition that an unknown is cast in the part of Samantha, so that his own role is not eclipsed.When he spots gorgeous Isabel Bigelow (Nicole Kidman) twitching her nose in public, Jack is positive he has found the perfect unknown for the role of Samantha. Unbeknownst to Jack, however, Isabel really is a witch who is just trying to live an ordinary life, doing the things that mere mortals do. She is trying very hard not to use her unusual abilities and is looking for someone who wants her just for herself. When she meets Jack, she misreads his intentions and finds herself on cloud nine. She does the show, playing the role of Samantha, only to discover that Jack is not really the person she thought he was. Then, let the games begin!Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell are both good in their respective roles, and Nicole Kidman really does have that nose twitch down pat, though her ostensible naivet' is a bit cloying. It is the supporting cast, however, that nearly runs away with the film. Michael Caine is wonderfully droll as Nigel Bigelow, Isabel's warlock father, who pops up when she least expects it. Shirley MacLaine gives a terrific, over the top performance as actress Iris Smythson, who is cast to play Samantha's television mom, Endora. Jason Schwartzman is excellent in the role of Ritchie, Jack's smarmy, sleazy agent. Kristin Chenoweth is adorable as Isabel's perky neighbor and new found friend. David Alan Grier, Heather Burns, and Steve Carrell round out the notables in the film.The film has plenty of star power and enough laughs to keep it plodding along, but its downfall lies in the script, which screenwriter Nora Ephron wrote, together with her sister, Delia. While I have to give them kudos for the new twist, in the end the film fails to fully satisfy the viewer, as it tries too hard to be all things to all people. The original ""Bewitched"" was a simple fantasy comedy. Now, the screenwriters have tried, unsuccessfully, to interject romance into the formula, making it a fantasy comedy with romantic overtones. Not only is there not enough chemistry between the two leads, the romance is simply unnecessary. Perhaps they should have stuck to the original premise. After all, if it ain't broke, why fix it?In any case, this is still a moderately enjoyable film that is certainly worth a rental.",3,BEWITCHED...BOTHERED....AND BEWILDERED...,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,3183,"['take-off', 'popular', 'television', 'sit-com', 'Bewitched', 'originally', 'starred', 'adorable', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'witch', 'Samantha', 'Stevens', 'who', 'married', 'mere', 'mortal', 'Darrin', 'Stevens', 'played', 'Dick', 'York', 'television', 'show', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'not', 'even', 'eventual', 'replacement', 'Dick', 'York', 'actor', 'role', 'husband', 'made', 'lose', 'ground', 'devoted', 'audience.So', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'credit', 'tries', 'give', 'original', 'premise', 'fresh', 'look', 'So', 'film', 'actually', 're-make', 'original', 'sit-com', 'funny', 'man', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'playing', 'part', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'down', 'luck', 'actor', 'looking', 'give', 'faltering', 'career', 'boost', 'When', 'offered', 'chance', 'play', 'part', 'Darrin', 'Stevens', 'television', 're-make', 'Bewitched', 'opportunity', 'condition', 'unknown', 'cast', 'part', 'Samantha', 'own', 'role', 'not', 'eclipsed.When', 'gorgeous', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'twitching', 'nose', 'public', 'Jack', 'positive', 'found', 'perfect', 'unknown', 'role', 'Samantha', 'Unbeknownst', 'Jack', 'however', 'Isabel', 'really', 'witch', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'live', 'ordinary', 'life', 'doing', 'things', 'mere', 'mortals', 'do', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'use', 'unusual', 'abilities', 'looking', 'someone', 'who', 'just', 'When', 'Jack', 'intentions', 'cloud', 'nine', 'show', 'playing', 'role', 'Samantha', 'only', 'discover', 'Jack', 'not', 'really', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'Then', 'let', 'games', 'begin', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'are', 'good', 'respective', 'roles', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'really', 'have', 'nose', 'twitch', 'down', 'pat', 'ostensible', 'naivet', 'bit', 'cloying', 'supporting', 'cast', 'however', 'nearly', 'away', 'film', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'wonderfully', 'droll', 'Nigel', 'Bigelow', 'Isabel', 'warlock', 'father', 'who', 'up', 'when', 'least', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'terrific', 'top', 'performance', 'actress', 'Iris', 'Smythson', 'who', 'cast', 'play', 'Samantha', 'television', 'mom', 'Endora', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'excellent', 'role', 'Ritchie', 'Jack', 'smarmy', 'sleazy', 'agent', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'adorable', 'Isabel', 'perky', 'neighbor', 'new', 'found', 'friend', 'David', 'Alan', 'Grier', 'Heather', 'Burns', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'out', 'notables', 'film.The', 'film', 'plenty', 'star', 'power', 'enough', 'laughs', 'keep', 'plodding', 'along', 'downfall', 'script', 'screenwriter', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'wrote', 'together', 'sister', 'Delia', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'new', 'twist', 'end', 'film', 'fully', 'satisfy', 'viewer', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'things', 'people', 'original', 'Bewitched', 'was', 'simple', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'Now', 'screenwriters', 'have', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'interject', 'romance', 'formula', 'making', 'fantasy', 'comedy', 'romantic', 'overtones', 'Not', 'only', 'there', 'not', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leads', 'romance', 'simply', 'unnecessary', 'Perhaps', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'original', 'premise', 'ai', ""n't"", 'broke', 'why', 'fix', 'case', 'still', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental']",N/A
168663,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,1404974571,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 6]","When the film ""Bewitched"" hit the theatres, I came away disappointed.  I didn't think the ""reality"" or show within a show worked well in the screenplay.  Rather than having Isabelle Bigalow actually be a witch who gets cast playing a witch, it would have simply been funnier to have the characters of Samantha and Darrin Stevens updated in some 90-minute magical adventure.  Nora Ephron has been nominated for three Oscars as a screenwriter (""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Silkwood,"" & ""Sleepless in Seattle""); but the construction of this film didn't work well for me.Now it's been quite a while later & a copy of the film appeared in a bargain bin; so it came home.  Watching it again, knowing that I didn't particularly like the structure of the film, I was able to enjoy it and be amused by what it does offer.  Nicole Kidman is lovely in the picture, a pouty little witch trying for some peculiar reason to fit into mortal life.  Samantha had the reason that she was in love with her husband; but we're never quite clear what the attraction is for Isabelle.  However, she does a good job trying not to use witchcraft and then breaking her own rules like putting the clock back 5 minutes in the diner so she can have breakfast.  Of course, as a witch she could ""poof"" her own breakfast anyway; so we're not quite sure why all this makes sense in this film version.Wes Ferrell made me laugh as Ron Burgandy.  But here there isn't a great attraction.  The funniest scene is when he walks nude onto the TV set for an interview.  Michael Caine as Nigel, the father, doesn't have a lot to do.  What he's asked to do like appear as a seaman on a box of fish fries, he does well.  The same really can be said of Shirley MacLaine as Iris Smythson playing Endora.  The fact that she's also a real-life witch just seems to make the plot complex and weighted rather than funny.Jason Schwartzman that I just watched in ""Shopgirl"" does a good job as the babbling agent.  Kristen Chenoweth who I recently saw in ""RV"" with Robin Williams does a nice job as the ditsy neighbor Maria Kelly.  Steve Carell who comes in later in the film as Uncle Arthur does an energetic homage to Paul Lynde.  Stephen Colbert from TV's Comedy Channel ""news"" show ""The Colbert Report"" is hilarious as Stu Robinson.  He might have actually made a better Darrin in the film.  Michael Budalucco who we loved from the old ""The Practice"" TV series strings sausages over the flat to attract the dog as Joey Props in his small bit in this show.  Carole Shelley pops in as a real-life Aunt Clara, not imitating the addled Marion Lorne from the TV series.  She does a nice but brief job.  Her career has been a long one from two films in 1968 (""The Boston Strangler"" & ""The Odd Couple"") to ""Quiz Show"" with Robert Redford in 1994.All in all, the comedy here goes down sweetly.  Some of the deleted scenes of the DVD are interesting.  While this will never be considered a great film, it is pleasant enough once you loose yourself from your expectations that it will be as funny as the original series once was.

Since it has its good points and bad points, let's start with the bad points first:As my title indicates, I liked the extras better.  Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman had chemistry?  Where was I, because I rented this flick against my better judgement after all the negative feedback it received.  Was I watching the movie where this so-called chemistry took place?  Um, I don't think so.We are to believe that Nicole Kidman's character is innocent and naive as a witch?  That's great until she asks what a d*ck is.  What, warlocks don't have those?Will Ferrell couldn't be Darrin Stevens if he wanted to and, in fact, he isn't even a great romantic lead.  I couldn't warm up to him in this film at all as somebody, ANYBODY--least of all Nicole Kidman--would want to procreate with.  As a matter of fact, before she rewinds a spell on him, I wanted to beat him unconscious with a boat oar!The story started out well enough, but it went downhill quickly and couldn't recover itself.  This isn't to say I wasn't entertained, because some of the one-liners were quite funny.The good points:Shirley MacClain was, indeed, wonderful as Iris, the supporting actress who played Endora on the series, and Michael Cain stole every scene he was in with both the grace and ease of a solid verteran English actor, and I thought they clicked a lot more than Ferrell and Kidman.  I also think their talents were greatly misused in what could have been a better film.Also of note, Nicole Kidman was good with what she had to work with, and I thought both her wardrobe and her girl-next-door looks in the movie were an asset.  I also think Kristen Chenoweth was good, but she is highly talented and capable of doing far better things than playing Isabel's feisty little neighbor.In summation, though I didn't love this movie, I have seen worse, and wouldn't turn it down as a rental.

168672,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,1404974571,Mark Baker,"[4, 13]","Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) has hit a career snag.  His last couple of movies have flopped at the box office and he desperately needs a hit.  The answer comes from a surprising place, a TV remake of the classic sit-com Bewitched.  Initially reluctant, he gets talked into it.  But he'll do it only if his co-star is a complete unknown.Enter Isabel Bigelow (Nicole Kidman).  She's just moved to LA and is in need of a job to pay for the house she's renting.  As chance would have it, the two meet one day at a bookstore, where Jack spies Isabel twitching her nose unconsciously.  He's immediately struck with her ability to recreate the original show's signature move, and talks her into being his co-star.There's just one thing Jack doesn't know.  Isabel is a real witch trying to give up her magic.  As his ego continues to run the production, she feels compelled to do little things to keep him in check.  Or big things if the need is called for.  And the two co-stars seem to be actually falling for each other as well.Unlike many of the straight remakes being done today, this one offers a cleaver twist, the remake within a remake.  This alone gives the movie an edge above many similar movies coming out every year.  And it really does need that edge.For the most part, the movie is a simple romantic comedy.  The plot complications may take on a different nature, but they aren't too different from the normal boy meets girl, they fight, they make up and live happily after ever storyline.  As always, it's how the movie carries it out that makes the difference.  This one entertains with lots of magic jokes and references to the original series.  We get to see lots of the original pilot remade, which is fun.  There are also a couple cameos by characters from the original series, even if played by different actors.All the actors do a fine job with their rolls.  Nicole Kidman is great as Isabel, an innocent trying to do without her magic.  I'm not normally a Will Ferrell fan, but his many personality changes as Jack were great to watch.  Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine are outstanding in their supporting rolls.  And I must mention how much fun it was to see Kristin Chenoweth on the big screen as well.As is usual these days, the movie has been released in a special edition.  The movie is presented in wide screen and full surround.  Extras include the usual deleted scenes, director commentary, and outtakes.A masterpiece?  No.  But this movie is worth watching for an entertaining hour and a half or so.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 9]","I'm going to go ahead and assume that you're familiar with the original series starring Elizabeth Montgomery (since the movie does).  I'll also assume that you've heard at least a thumbnail of the plot in which Will Ferrell plays a hasn't-had-a-hit-in-awhile Hollywood actor who decides to resurrect his career by doing a revival of the old ""Bewitched"" show altered to highlight HIM as the leading man.  The ""catch"" is that when he insists on casting an unknown that he can tromp all over as Samantha he chooses Nicole Kidman who - is really a witch!If you throw in supporting characters played by the likes of Michael Caine and Shirley Maclaine, how could you go wrong?Why, by the script, of course.  And the direction.  The talented Nora Ephron, who did much better work on ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"", doesn't push this project along in a single direction.  Sometimes it's a silly farce.  (The funniest scene in the movie comes at a dry-run script read where Nicole hexes Will into some funny stuff.)  Sometimes it's a romantic comedy, and it is so formulaic that in the big ""here's-my-surprise-oh,-don't-run-away"" scene of the film I half expected that they would wind up with one character hot-footing it for a train station or airport with the other in hot pursuit. (as happens so often in unimaginative romantic comedies.) The ""misunderstanding"" portion of the film is resolved without a chase, but just as predictably as the worst romantic comedies you have seen.  Part of the movie is a satire on the big egos and the brown-nosers who feed the big egos in Hollywood - but these parts were totally unconvincing, and I think the parts were unconvincing ""as written"", although it could have been ""as directed"", but the fault is a moot point as both were Ms. Ephron. If you want to watch a movie where Hollywood sticks it to itself I recommend the much better ""The Player"" with Tim Robbins and guest-starring practically everyone in California who couldn't wait to poke fun at Hollywood. And where did the idea come from that a ""losing heat Hollywood actor"" would decide that the way to ""comeback"" would be to play ""Darrin""?  Darrin Stephens was such a bland part that the original show moved along without skipping a beat when Dick York was replaced by Dick Sargent.Nicole Kidman pretty much nails her part - no complaints here.  Caine and MaClaine are delightful in their 10 minutes of screen time.  Ferrell is.... all over the place.  His ""unhexed"" Hollywood Actor personality is such a jerk and so over-the-top as a jerk that 1. he's just not believable (and as the ""mortal"" he's supposed to be the one you don't have to suspend disbelief for) and 2.

Some guys came over and proceeded to do a bust-out of his business.  First, they ordered lots of cases of Ramlosa.  Then, they told him he was going to do a new production of Bewitched.  He laughed in their face and they broke his legs.  Then the producer crawled over to a director, who tried to refuse.  But the producer had compromising pictures of him so there was nothing he could do.  The Producer then hired Nicole Kidman, who he also had pictures of, and also Will Ferrell.  Nicole Kidman didn't want to work with Ferrell, so her agent tried to get pictures of him, but only succeeded in getting pictures of Ferrelll's agent.  So Ferrrellll fired the agent that everybody had pictures of and went right on being Darrin.  When the backers of the film saw the rushes, they tried to back out, but the producer had pictures of them.

For that reason, I was looking forward to seeing the Bewitched movie, but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.  While the remake-within-a-remake concept is original, it didn't go over too well.  Some parts of the movie were silly.  The whole idea of Isabel being a real witch who is chosen to play a witch on tv is corny.  Even cornier is that Isabel has an Aunt Clara in real life who is identical to the Aunt Clara on the Bewitched series, and that Mr. and Mrs. Kravits also turn out to be real, as they become Isabel and Jack's neighbors at the end (even though the scene is cute).  The part where Uncle Arthur is a figment of Jack's imagination is also silly and unconvincing, although Steve Carroll does an impressive impersonation of the late Paul Lynde.  In addition, the way Isabel uses her magic to get back at Jack when she's mad at him doesn't go over too smoothly.  Also, the total character turnaround of Jack from conceited, obnoxious actor to compassionate and humble nice guy is not very believable.  The ending is also tiringly predictable.  The beginning of the movie is good, as Isabel, tired of living life as a witch,  settles into a house (very cute how she turns a picture of a house into a real house for rent), goes shopping, and tries to adjust to living mortal life.  In a delightful twist, Isabel has a cat who is black with yellow speckles.  The scenes between Isabel and her father are excellent (Michael Caine is superb and very effective as Isabel's father).  However, after the part where Isabel is recruited to play Samantha, the movie goes downhill.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that this movie would have been much better if they had canned the remake-within-a-remake idea and had made an actual remake of the series with Nicole Kidman as Samantha and Jack Wyatt as Darrin.  Michael Caine and Shirley MacClaine would have both been brilliant as Maurice and Endora.",3,A bit of a disappointment,1130630400,"10 30, 2005",2005,2042,"['grew', 'up', 'Bewitched', 'series', 'dearly', 'loved', 'then', 'continued', 'love', 'reruns', 'many', 'years', 'afterward', 'reason', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'Bewitched', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'remake-within-a-remake', 'concept', 'original', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'too', 'well', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'silly', 'whole', 'idea', 'Isabel', 'being', 'real', 'witch', 'who', 'chosen', 'play', 'witch', 'tv', 'corny', 'Even', 'cornier', 'Isabel', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'real', 'life', 'who', 'identical', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'Bewitched', 'series', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Kravits', 'also', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'become', 'Isabel', 'Jack', 'neighbors', 'end', 'even', 'scene', 'cute', 'part', 'where', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'figment', 'Jack', 'imagination', 'also', 'silly', 'unconvincing', 'Steve', 'Carroll', 'impressive', 'impersonation', 'late', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'addition', 'way', 'Isabel', 'magic', 'get', 'back', 'Jack', 'when', 'mad', ""n't"", 'go', 'over', 'too', 'smoothly', 'Also', 'total', 'character', 'turnaround', 'Jack', 'conceited', 'obnoxious', 'actor', 'compassionate', 'humble', 'nice', 'guy', 'not', 'very', 'believable', 'ending', 'also', 'tiringly', 'predictable', 'beginning', 'movie', 'good', 'Isabel', 'tired', 'living', 'life', 'witch', 'house', 'very', 'cute', 'how', 'picture', 'house', 'real', 'house', 'rent', 'shopping', 'tries', 'adjust', 'living', 'mortal', 'life', 'delightful', 'twist', 'Isabel', 'cat', 'who', 'black', 'yellow', 'speckles', 'scenes', 'Isabel', 'father', 'are', 'excellent', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'superb', 'very', 'effective', 'Isabel', 'father', 'However', 'part', 'where', 'Isabel', 'recruited', 'play', 'Samantha', 'movie', 'downhill', 'agree', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'canned', 'remake-within-a-remake', 'idea', 'had', 'made', 'actual', 'remake', 'series', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Samantha', 'Jack', 'Wyatt', 'Darrin', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Shirley', 'MacClaine', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'brilliant', 'Maurice', 'Endora']",N/A

At about 7, I came under the Bewitched spell and loved the show.  When Bewitched the movie was released, I went to see it right away, hoping to recapture my childhood love of the TV show.  The film did not disappoint.The writers didn't merely replicate the TV series; they cleverly recreated snapshots of it through this movie about the remaking of the series.  Nicole Kidman was squeeze-ably nave in the role as Isabel Bigelow, the witch-turned-actress.  Will Ferrell delivered all the goofiness of Darrin, all the arrogance of a has-been movie star, and all the soul of a man in love.  (Will's character, Jack Wyatt, hopelessly falls for Isabel as, of course, does Darrin fall for Samantha).  One scene in which Jack (Will) is supposed to deliver one line instead turns into a verbal fiasco, thanks to Isabel's magic, and is one of the most side-splittingly funny scenes in any movie I've seen.Shirley McClain was superb as Endora.  Not only does Shirley resemble Endora, she also magically produced Endora's mannerisms, quirks and flair for the dramatic.  I'm pretty sure Steve Carell was channeling Uncle Arthur because he sounded like him, looked like him, and behaved like him flawlessly.The set is idyllic, the actors are amazing, and the story impeccable.  The recitation of spells and hexes are mildly unnerving to me, personally, but they're only a tiny fraction of the whole film.This is a delightful, sweet, funny and entertaining movie.

Nicole Kidman was luminous and did was required of her, but some of the writing had her looking like such an absolute idiot, and that baffled me. The TV Samantha was never stupid, and sadly, this film's version of that character (Isabel) was so removed from the mortal world that it seemed she had just arrived and no idea of ""real life."" I could almost buy that idea, but the character's behavior was just plain stupid at times and her quest for ""real life"" landed her in ""reel life"" which was so fake. Perhaps that was the point of the film, but it lent a very plastic feel to the whole thing and not enough depth to the supposed ""real"" moments. Poor Will Farrell seemed to be caught between the pompous and the absurd, and he seemed very uncomfortable with his role of leading man. And the supporting character actors were good but didn't seem to have enough to do, so there was almost a floundering feel.

Dirou,"[8, 11]","I was so looking forward to seeing this film, being such a huge fan of the original television series, as well as for the quality star line up it contained. Unfortunately, I found it to be sadly disappointing. Though I realize it's a difficult task to not only live up to the original, but also put an original spin on the concept, I found this to be a very weak half baked effort that just didn't seem to know where it was going and what kind of movie it was trying to be. Its concept of the life imitating art premise of an actress auditioning for a remake of the series, and who actually turns out to be a real witch, appeared interesting and promising but it just didn't get off the ground. Instead the characters, pasted on to a very wishy washy plot, turned out to be mere pale impersonations of the originals that weren't particularly funny, and just appeared thinly created and out of date.That was another problem with the film, it seemed very muddled, not really knowing which period it was in. Though Bewitched is a timeless comedy, it was made in a very different era of television that had an innocence and naivety to it which is out of place in this more sexually liberated but cynical of times. I don't see why the creaters behind this film could not have tried to bring it up to date more plausibly, especially given the technology and special effects available. I think it would have been very possible and provided a far more interesting result without doing a disservice to the original.Nicole Kidman is suitably cute and feminine and yes, definately has the nose twitch down pat. But she is no Elizabeth Montgomery and should have tried to make the 'Isabel' character more her own (and without that contrived sugary voice). Much better use could have been made of Michael Caine and Shirley Maclean, who were perfect for the 'Maurice' and 'Endora' roles but let down by a poor script and storyline. I didn't find the Will Ferrell character who played Darrin remotely funny or even likable to be frank, but once again the weak scripting and plot didn't help.I confess I expected so much more from this remake, even without harsh judgement or unfair comparisons to the original, it just didn't stand up on it's own merit at all in my view and was just a poorly made film.",2,Sadly Disappointing,1141257600,"03 2, 2006",2006,2288,"['was', 'so', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'film', 'being', 'such', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'television', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'quality', 'star', 'line', 'contained', 'Unfortunately', 'found', 'be', 'sadly', 'disappointing', 'realize', 'difficult', 'task', 'not', 'only', 'live', 'up', 'original', 'also', 'put', 'original', 'spin', 'concept', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'weak', 'half', 'baked', 'effort', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'where', 'was', 'going', 'what', 'kind', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'be', 'concept', 'life', 'imitating', 'art', 'premise', 'actress', 'auditioning', 'remake', 'series', 'who', 'actually', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'witch', 'appeared', 'interesting', 'promising', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'ground', 'Instead', 'characters', 'pasted', 'very', 'wishy', 'washy', 'plot', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'mere', 'pale', 'impersonations', 'originals', 'were', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'funny', 'just', 'appeared', 'thinly', 'created', 'date.That', 'was', 'problem', 'film', 'seemed', 'very', 'muddled', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'period', 'was', 'Bewitched', 'timeless', 'comedy', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'different', 'era', 'television', 'had', 'innocence', 'naivety', 'place', 'more', 'sexually', 'liberated', 'cynical', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'creaters', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'tried', 'bring', 'up', 'date', 'more', 'plausibly', 'especially', 'given', 'technology', 'special', 'effects', 'available', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'possible', 'provided', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'result', 'doing', 'disservice', 'original.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'suitably', 'cute', 'feminine', 'yes', 'definately', 'nose', 'twitch', 'down', 'pat', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'should', 'have', 'tried', 'make', ""'Isabel"", 'character', 'more', 'own', 'contrived', 'sugary', 'voice', 'Much', 'better', 'use', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Shirley', 'Maclean', 'who', 'were', 'perfect', ""'Maurice"", ""'Endora"", 'roles', 'let', 'down', 'poor', 'script', 'storyline', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'who', 'played', 'Darrin', 'remotely', 'funny', 'even', 'likable', 'be', 'frank', 'once', 'again', 'weak', 'scripting', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'help.I', 'confess', 'expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'remake', 'even', 'harsh', 'judgement', 'unfair', 'comparisons', 'original', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'stand', 'up', 'own', 'merit', 'view', 'was', 'just', 'poorly', 'made', 'film']",N/A

Determined to avoid simply making a bigscreen version of the beloved television classic, the filmmakers here have actually created something rather original and just as entertaining while still staying true to the show's basic theme. A lovely young woman, who happens to also be a witch, does her best to give up her magical ways in order to find a nice but incomplete young man and settle down to a normal life. However, her introduction to suburban normalcy is shaken up when she meets a falling movie-star named Jack Wyatt in search of an unknown to play opposite himself in a new television revival of ""Bewitched"". Little does he know that Isabel Bigelow, the young lady in question, is a real witch. All he cares about is that she can wiggle her nose just like the original Samantha and also happens to look a lot like her. In need of a job and thinking Jack might be the perfect man for her, Isabel is talked into taking the role not knowing that Jack intends to make the show all about Darrin this time around. As one might expect, the spells begin to fly as Isabel attempts to earn her due respect and appreciation on the ""Bewitched"" set and in Jack's heart. And things really get crazy when the TV show characters begin to enter the real world to make sure everything works out right!Nicole Kidman stars as Isabel, the woman cast to play Samantha on the new ""Bewitched"", and she is absolutely adorable in this film. Love the bouncy hair and sweetheart personality; never more attractive! Will Ferrell is always enjoyable, here playing the role of oft-misled but good-at-heart Jack Wyatt, though this isn't a film that is all about him. It's totally a shared billing, and why audiences didn't see chemistry in this pair is beyond me. They are fantastic together, and this is a film with just a great cast over all. Sir Michael Caine plays Isabel's warlock father, Nigel, Shirley MacLaine is Iris, the actress cast as the new Endora, and Steve Carell pops in to play a magical incarnation of Uncle Arthur, just to name a few! It's a very sweet film that is loads of fun if you can get past that whiney insistence that a ""Bewitched"" movie has to be a remake. Don't get me wrong, I understand the desire for such a film, even if Director Nora Ephron didn't. Seeing updated, big budget, bigscreen versions of TV shows we loved in the past is great fun! The old talk about a feature starring Alicia Silverstone as Samantha and Jim Carrey as Darrin probably had a lot of people excited. I wanted to see that too, and Crispin Glover also would have made a great Darrin. Never would have thought about Will Ferrell, but since he's not REALLY Darrin here, it works, and Nicole Kidman probably really would have been a perfect choice for Samantha. Here, her personality is much more sweet and innocent, but then she isn't exactly playing Samantha and it's perfect for who she IS playing. The existing ""Bewitched"" movie took the subject matter and did something original with it, and it turned out wonderful, even if I would have loved to have seen a big budget take on the old show. If I were going to pick on anything, it would be the minimized and tardy explanation of the TV characters merging with the real world. Despite Uncle Arthur's exclamation, ""Do I have to explain everything?!"" the set up of actors portraying the old TV characters, but with real similarities, makes things confusing if you start bringing in the real characters without much explanation. I think this only doesn't bother me now because I have watched the film enough times, and all the bonus features, to be clear on it, but I can easily see how it would be an issue for many casual viewers. It's just a matter of paying better attention though, and doing a little open-minded/imaginative thinking, and it certainly adds to the fun. Another thing that adds to the fun are several excellent music selections! I even loved hearing Louis Armstrong singing Disney's ""'Bout Time"" in the closing credits!The DVD is great, with excellent widescreen picture, a fine director's commentary, deleted scenes and multiple featurettes, a trivia track (though you have to be a fast reader for this one), and a trivia game for fans of the original series. So, if you're interested in checking out a romantic comedy with a lot of magic and TV nostalgia, I highly recommend picking this one up! And especially if you're a fan of any of the stars! I'm not a hardcore Kidman fan, but she is a complete delight here, and particularly gorgeous!",5,"Sweet, Charming, Magical, Underappreciated Romantic Comedy",1271721600,"04 20,

168695,A1GE1H2W7UH3K4,1404974571,"Motown Fan ""Mr. Music""","[4, 10]","I must agree with another reviewer, what a disgrace to the highly regarded and much loved TV series that so many of us still cherish.  In no way can anyone possibly fill Elizabeth Montgomery's shoes.  She had that special something, that likability that turned the show into an instant classic.  Don't get me wrong, Nicole Kidman sure looked the part, and Shirley Maclaine did too, but maybe if they would have had a real script, an actual story about the characters instead of, 'hey, lets remake the TV show and mention every five mintutes that the audience is watching a movie about remaking a tv show.'  I mean come on people, is that even considered a plot by anyone's standards?  Not mine.  Scream 3's movie within a movie was one of the worst excuses of a movie I've ever seen (and I feel the first one was a masterpiece).  Why in the world would anyone want to even try to remake-or in this case, tarnish-such a beloved TV show.  This is definitely one they should have left alone.  Just how fast this movie was gone from the theaters and put onto dvd just a couple months later speaks volumes as to what a snoozer it really was.  And, it also should remind us all why we love the REAL Bewitched show so.  How can you possibly replace Elizabeth Montgomery.  Can't be done.  And characters such as Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara and Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur, they were brilliant character actors and can never be replaced.  The same should be said about Agnes Moorehead's brilliant turn as endora and Dick York's Darrin (don't EVEN get me started on the whole Dick York/Dick Sargent fiasco!).

Yes, that is true...She must be a genius because she was able to come up with such a great plot in such a short time (9:00PM to 11:00AM). In case you don't know, Bewitched is not about Samantha Stevens And Darrin. It's about a concieted actor named Jack Wyatt (a hysterical Will Ferrell) who has had his share of big flops. Ans when he gets the offer to remake the old T.V. show, ""Bewitched"", he accepts. It is up to him to find a hot unknown actress to play the role of Samantha. But, the reason why he wants her to be an unknown is because he wants to take over the whole show. He doesn't care what the woman thinks.Isabel Bigelow (an as usual, Brilliant Nicole Kidman) is a real-life witch who can have anything she wants with a snap of a finger or a wiggle of a nose. He sees Isabel in a book store and he decides to give her an audition. She is perfect to play the role of a witch because...well, she is a witch. She soon catches on what his intentions are and she sets many spells on him.""Bewitched"" has a hysterical plot. Dare I say, a better plot than the original series.

My wife and I borrowed it from a friend for the heck of it and we were totally surprised, pleasantly so, that not only was it not terrible, it was actually pretty funny!  It had some really cute moments with Nicole Kidman, who played the part very well.  I despise Will Ferrell, but even his obnoxious usual self didn't detract (much) from this charming movie.The intricacies of the plot are a bit confusing, but it goes something like this:  Ferrell plays washed-up actor Jack who takes a part of Darren in a remake of the Bewitched TV Show (yes, the original one - the movie acknowledges the original series many many times).  He needs a no-name female lead for Samantha so he can hog the spotlight for himself and hopefully relaunch his career.  He sees Nicole Kidman on the street, a real-life witch named Isabelle who recently decided to try being 'a normal mortal'.  He hires her immediately.Hilarity ensues of course.  There's some very cute moments with Kidman and Michael Caine, who plays her father.  Kidman steals the show a bit as her character is arguably the most interesting to watch on screen.  She carries the movie somewhat, as without her I'm not sure if we'd have enjoyed it as much as we did (or at all).

Will Farrell plays falling movie star Jack Wyatt, signed to play Darren in the remake of the show.  But to avoid being eclipsed by a star playing Samantha, he insists on an unknown for that role.Nicole Kidman is Isabel  Bigelow, a real witch who has just sworn off magic.  Wyatt sees her wiggling nose between the stacks in a book store, and persuades her to audition for the part of Samantha.  What sort of relationship will develop between Jack and Isabel is the primary focus of the plot, and develops very comically.Anyone who liked Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha would understandably object to any replacement at all.  But at least they went to one of the biggest stars available, Kidman, and also paid respect to Montgomery with a few clips of her from the series.  As far as I'm concerned that makes it ok.  Anyway, Nicole Kidman is great in the role.Michael Caine plays Isabel's father.  Shirley MacLaine is the actress hired to play Endora, and also happens to be a real witch.  A minor sublot involves romance between these two.Bewitched is the best comedy I've seen so far this year, but that's not saying so much; there haven't been many other really funny ones.

Why would a witch with such powers not be cynical and jaded, or at least wizened by her experiences?  This is never fully explained, but this witch is a freshman to the ways of the world.  Overall though, there is little depth, and the ending is not worthy of the prior film.Does anyone think Schwartzman's character, Ferrel's agent, was meant to caricaturize Tom Cruise ala Jerry McGuire?

She tells her father Nigel (Michael Caine) that she wants to fall in love with a mortal. A man who is a total mess and desperately needs her as she puts it. Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) is a big screen star with a long list of flops to his name and a wife who just left him. Jack is a total mess and he will need Isabel more than he knows. The only work he can get is a T.V. remake of Bewitched. He has say in the casting and he wants to cast an unknown in the role of Samantha so that he can upstage her and hopefully get his career going again. He needs someone who can wiggle her nose like on the original which it turns out Isabel can as Jack finds out one day. He talks to her and tells her how badly he needs her and how if she takes the job they can be together forever. Isabel takes everything he says at face value not realizing that he is acting and saying the things he is in character. Isabel was never allowed to watch Bewitched as a kid so she is surprised when she gets on set to see how closely the show mirrors her own life. Things go well enough until she overhears Jack's assistant putting her down. She realizes what has been going on and she plots a revenge against Jack using her magic powers. Needless to say she casts a spell on him that goes wrong and the two actually do fall in love. There is the inevitable scene where Isabel has to come clean to Jack and tell him that she is a real witch and not surprisingly he doesn't believe her at first but then when he does he is shocked and disgusted to learn the truth. It is all typical romantic comedy plot. What makes this film enjoyable is the support that Ferrell and Kidman get from their co stars. Neither one of the leads is particularly good. Kidman is cute and Ferrell does his usual shouting comedy. The supporting cast includes the sexy/ squeaky Kristen Chenoweth as Isabel's neighbor who is always there to offer counsel to her new friend. Jason Schwartzman is great as Jack's obnoxious agent who refers to his client as Jack Attack. Steve Carell is hilarious in his one long scene as Uncle Arthur and  Michael Caine is wonderful as Nigel who is  a bit of a womanizer who likes girls who are much younger than he.

168720,A16QODENBJVUI1,1404974571,Robert Moore,"[7, 9]","There are so many things wrong with this film, it is hard to know where to begin.  First, it is a film adaptation of a hit television series, a genre of film that is consistently among the worst that exist.  Second, it is a poorly conceived adaptation.  Instead of making it a straightforward adaptation, the pretext of the film is that a real witch who is trying to give up her powers to settle down and marry a normal human being is miraculously cast in part of Samantha in a revival of the series BEWITCHED.  This is all fairly clever and I thoroughly approve doing a variant on show rather than a straight remake.  It worked for the quite funny films based on THE BRADY BUNCH (one of the few times where a movie was better than the TV show upon which it was based, though fans of the show might disagree with me), but unfortunately almost nothing else is clever.  I say ""almost"" because I did enjoy many moments when Isabel (Nicole Kidman).  The problem is that in the reconception, the pretense is that the actor who plays Darrin, Jack Wyatt (Will Farrell), is the lead in the show and not Samantha.  This is bad enough, but it is made worse by the wretched presence of Will Farrell in the role of Jack.  OK, I have to admit to being completely and utterly blind to the charms, real or otherwise, of Will Farrell.  I can honestly say that this is an actor who has never made me smile, let alone laugh.  But my gut feeling is that he is so inappropriate for this role that even a fan of his would be disappointed.  But the conceit that you could have BEWITCHED and try to shrink her part to that of a necessary but minor character is so silly that it doesn't even bear trying to make sense of.One of the most painful aspects of watching the film is seeing a lot of real talent wasted.  Though Will Farrell remains a complete mystery to me (actually he isn't a mystery:  he is simply awful, but I was being polite), Nicole Kidman, Michael Caine, and Shirley MacLaine are talented individuals.  How is it possible for someone as great as Caine manage to be in THE UGLY AMERICAN one year and BEWITCHED in another?  And what is it with veterans of THE DAILY SHOW?  Awesome show, but Steve Carell and Steve Colbert were stuck in this stinker and Carell has been in several Will Ferrel disasters.  Kristin Chenoweth went from being Glinda the Good Witch in WICKED to a inconsequential supporting role in this one.  And we haven't even gotten into Jason Schwartzman.The lines between Isabel's real life as a witch and the television show get increasingly blurred as the film goes along.  For instance, Aunt Clara shows up as Isabel's real aunt.  And, of course, she concocts a spell that goes awry.Even if the film didn't have all these other problems, there is still the fundamental chemistry between Jack and Isabel, which is to say, there is none.  One just needs to see the horrid scene in which the two of them have dinner overlooking L.A. and Jack sings and then tries to teach Isabel the song he wrote for her.  The entire scene is as flat as a scene can be, one of many that is largely ruined by Ferrel's lack of comic timing.  The timing isn't just Jack and Isabel, but everything in the film.

Renaming the characters and inventing a 'movie' storyline were only two of the problems which I saw while actually watching this movie.Will Ferrell's a decent guy, but Jack Wyatt( who plays 'Darrin') is not supposed to have a 'lead' screen time role in 'Bewitched'. The thrust of the plot needed to be his character reacting to (but not able to stop) what Isabel Bigelow (who plays 'Samantha')does with her powers.Isabel is cast for a 'Bewitched' movie after she is seen wiggling her nose in a local bookstore. The catch for this movie's plotline is that people do not realize that she actually is a witch.Bewitched had worked on the small screen specifically because the original was a metaphor for both interracial marriages and the emergent women's liberation movement. In contrast, the subplot of 'working on a movie set' just gets in the way of what really could have been an awesome screenplay.With vastly increased special effects capabilities now available in the 21st century, the potential for this film was squandered. Ephron and company should be ashamed of themselves for not even attempting to follow the classic TV show.

168722,AKELS44ECAVEB,1404974571,"Rogue Fox ""Rogue""","[7, 8]","Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman star in the new romantic comedy ""Bewitched"" based on the legendary show from the 60's!!! ""Bewitched"" is magic in my opinion, .... no not perfect but, I must say Ferrell and Kidman pack quite a punch, and are a perfect combo. You will either be rolling in laughter with Ferrell's antics or being aroused by Kidman's beauty and charm, casting her magic spell!!!Before, I watched the movie I had my doubts,.... since it's been a year of remakes and sequels: like ""Herbie: Fully Loaded"" and ""The Longest Yard"", thus questioning the movie's potential. I must admit when I saw the movie I wasn't overly impressed, but the concept alone was very creative; along with the Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman really add something magical to the film. ""Bewitched"" is a very clever and crafty single in the image of Nora Ephron (""Sleepless in Seattle"" /as well as/ "" You've Got Mail"").The story is something like this: Isabel (Kidman) is a witch who can get anything by the snap of her fingers or the twitch of her nose, that strives to be normal. Isabel is looking for something in her life; something like love. Meanwhile you also have Jack Wyatt( Ferrell) a washed up actor in Hollywood trying to make a big comeback or monopolize on a remake of the show ""Bewitched""( very interesting) , for his own selfish reasons. So he is looks for an unknown to play as Samantha, since he is playing as Darwin, who can get the part just write. One day just by magic he finds her, and convinces her to be part of the new ""Bewitched"" (not knowing she is a witch ) casting her. Isabel mistook by Jack's self centered scheme, feels that he may be the answer to all of her problems.With many unexpected twists and turns, between Isabel's sidesplitting magic and Jack's ,.... well ego they end up falling in love with each other. A lot like Samantha and Darwin went through during the original show. The film is very romantic, hilarious, clever, and something you are sure to love. So the film is basically a romantic comedy like other reviewers said!!!Yet the film isn't perfect,... well nothing is. ""Bewitched"" at times became a bit to plotty  with too many things happening at once. Along with some boring stretches and some too drawn out or unimportant things added in. The film was still good but it is no masterpiece!!! With an all star cast and a great concept.Overall, I will have to give ""Bewitched"" a well deserved 3.5/5, a great film make sure to rent!!! No regrets on seeing this one, not one of my personal favorites and could have been better in many ways.

It's more like a new brand of chewing gum that promises plenty of pizzazz, but quickly loses its flavor.Like her character Isabel, Nicole Kidman has little to do here. What is actually required of her talent is very little compared to her dramatic roles in ""The Hours"" or even ""The Others."" There's no reason to doubt her ability to pull off a comedic role, given the right script. Even so, she is beautiful to behold, and despite her character's lack of a personality and literally _unbelievable_ naivet&eacute;, Kidman is still worth watching here. (Plus, it's always amazing to hear someone who grew up in Austrailia or Britain acing an American accent -- something that her otherwise-likeable costar Michael Caine unfortunately has never mastered. In this film, as in ""The Cider House Rules,"" I kept wondering what unchartered English-speaking continent Caine's character hailed from.)As for Will Ferrell's role of Jack Wyatt -- unlike Kidman whose acting prowess continues to exceed my expectations in that she can make even empty characters such as Isabel seem at least likeable -- we never really see Ferrell delivering anything but standard Ferrell shtick here, even doing a brief, ironic interview with James Lipton, whom Ferrell has parodied before on Saturday Night Live. As it stands, Ferrell's bumbling character is as clueless as Kidman's - even Jack has to be coached on how to act and react to others, by his annoying agent.For my money, it's Shirley MacLaine who steals every scene she's in. She seems to truly enjoy her part and every time we see her, we can't help but believe Endora is infinitely more interesting and more fun than the characters she supports. With Carole Shelley and Steve Carell channeling the parts of Aunt Clara and Uncle Arthur, this film could have been a consistent hoot and a holler -- if only it'd had a script rather than merely a concept.Also, it's an incredible shame that Jim Carrey wasn't available for the lead role. He could have delivered a great performance while giving an uncanny resemblance to Darren 1, balancing Kidman's surprising resemblance to Samantha here. In Carrey's absence, the writers have Ferrell's character try to justify his own non-resemblance by claiming that audiences of the original series didn't notice the change in actors between Darren 1 and Darren 2, either. Well, yes, actially, we _did_ notice...All-in-all, it's worth a curious look-see, even if repeatedly disappointing. Did I expect a remake of the original series? No. Having seen the previews, I already knew that that wasn't the plot here. Did I expect it to be funny? Yes. And with so much invested in talent and production, I would have thought the effort to create a clever script could have been given priority as well. What instead followed was a hollow pumpkin shell of a premise that was more bothersome and bewildering than bemusing. Even witchcraft couldn't save this film from being little more than left-over Hollywood Halloween candy.

168724,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,1404974571,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 10]","*1/2""Bewitched"" is a painfully embarrassing remake of the classic TV sitcom that ran on ABC from 1964-1972.  The series, about a ""mixed"" marriage between a high-flying sorceress and an earthbound mortal, boasts some of the most familiar and iconic images in television history.Writer Nora Ephron has over-thought the concept to such an extent that she has managed to strip away most of the elements that made the series work in the first place.  The movie isn't technically a ""remake"" of ""Bewitched,"" since the witch played by Nicole Kidman isn't the Samantha Stevens of the series but rather a single woman named Isabel Bigelow who gets to PLAY Samantha Stephens on TV.  It's all very chic and complicated, you see, but the story goes something like this:  tired of the life of instant gratification that witchcraft so easily affords her, Isabel has decided to strike out on her own  as an utterly self-reliant mortal, moving into a tract home in the San Fernando Valley and vowing to get through the remainder of her days without the benefit of witchcraft.  One afternoon while at a bookstore, she is spotted by one Jack Wyatt, a pompous, self-centered movie actor whose career and personal life have both been in the tank of late and who is hoping to at least jumpstart the former by taking on the role of Darrin Stevens in a new version of the old series.  One glimpse of Isabel's nose-twitching ability convinces him that this non-actress would be perfect for the part, so we wind up, in true Pirandellian fashion, with a fictional TV witch being played by an honest-to-God real life witch.The overriding problem with this film is that it completely undercuts the very elements that made Samantha such a likable and compelling figure for millions of spellbound American viewers.  Even though the character played by Elizabeth Montgomery was basically just a ""typical American housewife,"" content with staying at home and submitting to her husband, she was also intelligent, shrewd, occasionally subversive and always wise to the ways of human nature.  Isabel is none of these things.  In fact, she has been conceived as little more than a dingbat airhead, dippy, goofy and hopelessly backward in her dealings with other people, making us wonder what it was she'd been doing for all the millennia prior to the time of this story.  I doubt Ephron intended for the story to be ironic in this way, but the old Samantha Stevens from 40 years ago came across as a more modern woman then than Isabel does today.  This is clearly Kidman's worst, most annoying performance ever, which only goes to show that even an Academy Award winning actress can't make a silk purse out of every sow's ear that comes her way.  The same goes for Will Ferrell in the role of the pseudo-Darrin whose over-the-top turn here is the movie equivalent of fingernails being dragged across a chalkboard for a grueling one hour and forty minutes (the combined running time of almost four episodes in the original series).  Michael Caine as Isabel's warlock father and Shirley MacLaine as a real life witch who happens to be playing Endora are both old pros enough to turn in decent performances, but even they will undoubtedly want to expunge this turkey from their otherwise illustrious resumes as soon as possible.In the TV ""Bewitched,"" there was a certain subtle tension built into the premise that carried through from episode to episode.  The Stevenses had to find ways to keep the outside world from finding the truth out about Samantha`s real identity, not always an easy task what with Endora or Aunt Clara or Uncle Arthur popping in unannounced at all hours of the day or night casting a spell on some poor, unsuspecting mortal or wreaking havoc on the young couple`s marital harmony and domestic bliss.  This tension is completely lost in the film, as is the conflict between Darrin and Endora that always threatened to end with Darrin being turned into a chimpanzee or a bullfrog and Samantha running back to the effortless ease and comfort of her former existence.  There really is no logical or coherent conflict to speak of in this film, just a lot of people running around acting silly to no discernible point or purpose.  In fact, the only quality scene in the movie is one in which Isabel and Jack are cavorting around an empty set while Frank Sinatra's version of the title song plays in the background.  It turns out to be the one - pardon the pun - ""magical"" moment in the film.For, astonishingly, even the magic in this film is humdrum compared with the stuff that was done on the TV show.  Someone should inform the makers of this film that special effects have actually advanced some in the last half century.  One would certainly never know it by watching this film.The one positive thing to be said about this movie is that it doesn't come saddled with one of those insipid, mind-numbing laugh tracks that are regularly slapped onto TV sitcoms - but then again even a laugh track wouldn`t find much to chortle over here.",1,Even a laugh track wouldn't find this funny,1121212800,"07 13,

168725,A1NDYXBX0IAUAY,1404974571,Ronald L. Russell,"[2, 9]","Nichole Kidman may become typecast as an actress who is adept at portraying witches. She played a witch alongside Sandra Bullock in ""Practical Magic"". In ""Bewitched"", she plays an actual witch named Isabel Bigelow who, by a very unlikely coincidence, ends up playing the part of Samantha in an updated version of the classic television series.The film ""Bewitched"" ends up being an affectionate homage to the series. Most of the characters from the show are portrayed, and mostly, very well. Nichole is simply magical as Isabel. Michael Caine is suave and sophisticated as Nigel Bigelow, her father. Shirley Maclaine is simply stunning as the actress who plays ""Endora"", with a surprise twist. ""Aunt Clara"" shows up, and seems like 35 years haven't touched her. Steve Carell is so amazing as ""Uncle Arthur"", it appears that he is actually channeling the late Paul Lynde, who portrayed the character in the series. Kirsten Chenoweth is a bubbly neighbor who becomes Isabels best friend. And David Allen Grier is a long suffering director at the studio where the new series is being filmed (similar to his role on the Bonnie Hunt show).If the movie has a weakness, it is Will Ferrell. Will is a great comedian, but perhaps not so believeable in a romantic role. So, when he is acting like an egocentric actor who always wants the spotlight on himself, he does this very well, and the viewer tends to believe the character. When he is trying to convince the audience that he has really fallen in love with Isabel, well, he reads the lines correctly, but somehow, doesn't seem sincere, although I believe he is sincerely trying. Perhaps in future movies Will may become a convincing romantic actor, but I felt distinctly that he was just playing a part. Someone else thought Jim Carrey would have been a better choice for the part, and I agree in principle. Jim is also very funny, and in addition has shown in several films that he can appear sincere and romantic as well. Jim also bears a more than passing resemblance to Dick York, the actor who played the original Darrin.However, I'll give Will a B-, as someone who doesn't even resemble the character he was trying to portray, he did ok, perhaps comparable to Dick Sargeant, the actor who replaced Dick York as Darrin in the last couple of seasons of the original series. Will wasn't terrible, he just isn't the best part of the movie.The movie does perpetuate a few stereotypes of witches having supernatural ""powers"", which makes them somehow not mortal, because this is what viewers expect, and of course, this is how witches were portrayed on the television show. This does make the movie quite fun to watch, even though one knows such things cannot happen.According to literature on the subject, those who actually practice witchcraft view it as more of an art, science, or technology by which one increases the liklihood of desired events happening, not by inborn abilities or powers, but by application of existing natural energies and forces such as sunlight, wind, and gravity. Witchcraft also can be viewed as a religion in which practitioners hold themselves in a close relationship with the natural world. There is absolutely no connection whatsoever with ""demonic forces"" or satanism, and for most witches, the very existence of such beings is not even a part of their belief system.One feature I did appreciate was that, although Will Ferrells character was afraid of Isabel when he found out she was a witch, his fear was shown to be completely unfounded. Every single one of the male and female witches in the movie were decent people, with no sinister aspect about them at all, and bearing ill will toward no one. In this respect, the movie implicity demonstrates how actual witches generally adhere to a code which states something like ""harm no one"" or words to that effect.Such special effects as are used in the film are rather subtle. We only get a glimpse of Isabel riding a broom, and some of the other things which happen, such as appearances and disappearances, do so in such a way that other people nearby do not even notice. In this respect, the movie actually improves on the television show, as the effects seem to work more smoothly.Directed by Nora Ephron, who has previously given us such movies as ""Sleepless In Seattle"", and ""You've Got Mail"", this is also a romantic comedy . I ended up enjoying the movie quite a bit. My wife had never seen the original series, and she thought this movie was charming. Taken as a whole, I found ""Bewitched"" to be funny, light and pleasant, and we felt good after having watched. I would like to see more movies of this sort.",4,An enchanting homage to the beloved tv series,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,4646,"['Nichole', 'Kidman', 'may', 'become', 'typecast', 'actress', 'who', 'adept', 'portraying', 'witches', 'played', 'witch', 'alongside', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'Bewitched', 'actual', 'witch', 'named', 'Isabel', 'Bigelow', 'who', 'very', 'unlikely', 'coincidence', 'up', 'playing', 'part', 'Samantha', 'updated', 'version', 'classic', 'television', 'series.The', 'film', 'Bewitched', 'up', 'being', 'affectionate', 'homage', 'series', 'Most', 'characters', 'show', 'are', 'portrayed', 'mostly', 'very', 'well', 'Nichole', 'simply', 'magical', 'Isabel', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'suave', 'sophisticated', 'Nigel', 'Bigelow', 'father', 'Shirley', 'Maclaine', 'simply', 'stunning', 'actress', 'who', 'Endora', 'surprise', 'twist', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'up', '35', 'years', 'have', ""n't"", 'touched', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'so', 'amazing', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'actually', 'channeling', 'late', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'who', 'portrayed', 'character', 'series', 'Kirsten', 'Chenoweth', 'bubbly', 'neighbor', 'who', 'Isabels', 'best', 'friend', 'David', 'Allen', 'Grier', 'long', 'suffering', 'director', 'studio', 'where', 'new', 'series', 'being', 'filmed', 'similar', 'role', 'Bonnie', 'Hunt', 'show', 'movie', 'weakness', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Will', 'great', 'comedian', 'perhaps', 'not', 'so', 'believeable', 'romantic', 'role', 'So', 'when', 'acting', 'egocentric', 'actor', 'who', 'always', 'spotlight', 'very', 'well', 'viewer', 'believe', 'character', 'When', 'trying', 'convince', 'audience', 'really', 'fallen', 'love', 'Isabel', 'well', 'lines', 'correctly', 'somehow', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sincere', 'believe', 'sincerely', 'trying', 'Perhaps', 'future', 'movies', 'Will', 'may', 'become', 'convincing', 'romantic', 'actor', 'felt', 'distinctly', 'was', 'just', 'playing', 'part', 'Someone', 'else', 'thought', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'part', 'agree', 'principle', 'Jim', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'addition', 'shown', 'several', 'films', 'can', 'appear', 'sincere', 'romantic', 'as', 'well', 'Jim', 'also', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Dick', 'York', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'Darrin.However', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Will', 'B-', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'resemble', 'character', 'was', 'trying', 'portray', 'did', 'ok', 'perhaps', 'comparable', 'Dick', 'Sargeant', 'actor', 'who', 'replaced', 'Dick', 'York', 'Darrin', 'last', 'couple', 'seasons', 'original', 'series', 'Will', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'just', ""n't"", 'best', 'part', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'perpetuate', 'few', 'stereotypes', 'witches', 'having', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'somehow', 'not', 'mortal', 'what', 'viewers', 'expect', 'course', 'how', 'witches', 'were', 'portrayed', 'television', 'show', 'make', 'movie', 'quite', 'fun', 'watch', 'even', 'one', 'knows', 'such', 'things', 'can', 'not', 'happen.According', 'literature', 'subject', 'who', 'actually', 'practice', 'witchcraft', 'view', 'more', 'art', 'science', 'technology', 'one', 'liklihood', 'desired', 'events', 'happening', 'not', 'inborn', 'abilities', 'powers', 'application', 'existing', 'natural', 'energies', 'forces', 'such', 'sunlight', 'wind', 'gravity', 'Witchcraft', 'also', 'can', 'be', 'viewed', 'religion', 'practitioners', 'hold', 'close', 'relationship', 'natural', 'world', 'absolutely', 'connection', 'whatsoever', 'demonic', 'forces', 'satanism', 'most', 'witches', 'very', 'existence', 'such', 'beings', 'not', 'even', 'part', 'belief', 'system.One', 'feature', 'did', 'appreciate', 'was', 'Will', 'Ferrells', 'character', 'was', 'afraid', 'Isabel', 'when', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'witch', 'fear', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'completely', 'unfounded', 'single', 'one', 'male', 'female', 'witches', 'movie', 'were', 'decent', 'people', 'sinister', 'aspect', 'bearing', 'ill', 'will', 'one', 'respect', 'movie', 'implicity', 'how', 'actual', 'witches', 'generally', 'adhere', 'code', 'something', 'harm', 'one', 'words', 'effect.Such', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'are', 'rather', 'subtle', 'only', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Isabel', 'riding', 'broom', 'other', 'things', 'happen', 'such', 'appearances', 'disappearances', 'do', 'so', 'such', 'way', 'other', 'people', 'nearby', 'do', 'not', 'even', 'notice', 'respect', 'movie', 'actually', 'television', 'show', 'effects', 'seem', 'work', 'more', 'smoothly.Directed', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'who', 'previously', 'given', 'such', 'movies', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Mail', 'also', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'ended', 'up', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'wife', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'original', 'series', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'charming', 'Taken', 'whole', 'found', 'Bewitched', 'be', 'funny', 'light', 'pleasant', 'felt', 'good', 'having', 'watched', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'more', 'movies', 'sort']",N/A

There was something so sweet, innocent and endearing about the 60s TV show. Despite its obvious and overt involvement in witchcraft, Elizabeth Montgomery had the beauty and sweetness to make the ""dark art"" appear to be sanctioned somewhere in the book of Leviticus. I grew up wishing Paul Lynde (Uncle Arthur) was my uncle and that I had a sweet aunt like dear Aunt Clara... and was grateful that I never lived next to a Gladys Kravitz.How on earth could anyone bring this cast back from the dead (literally) and capture the sweetness thereof? In this clever twist, Will Ferrell is a well-known, but washed-up actor who has been in one of the worst, money-losing flops in movie history given an opportunity to bring the beloved 1960s sit-com back to the small screen. Eager to be the only one in the spotlight and regain his lost glory, he ""discovers"" an unknown to be his co-star. Nikole Kidman somehow channels Elizabeth Montgomery - just as charming, sweet and beautiful as the former ""Bewitched"" star.There is some language here and there, but there is a charming innocence to this film that just isn't seen in most of what Hollywood offers to adults outside of animated fare or cheesy talking animal flicks.Ferrell shines as a pitiful pup falling for the innocent, but truly witchy Kidman. Shirley MacLaine is the perfect as the actress portraying Endora and there is clever and sweet dialogue throughout.I remember reading a review shortly after this film debuted that was titled, ""No amount of magic can save this film."" I cannot disagree more. I really had no interest in seeing this film, assuming it was a doomed failure from its conception. Upon the urging of friends, I joined them to see this on the big screen and I was truly delighted by the uncanny innocence and the way the film enjoys ribbing itself.If you're raising your kids to avoid Harry Potter and any other inklings of witchcraft, this is certainly not family fare... but for adults who are tired of having their eyes besieged by sexual antics, toilet humor and violence, this film is a nice retreat. There are no pre-marital bed-hopping scenes, language is comparable to prime-time TV (for what that's worth!), and other than some cute slapstick, no one gets shot, cut or obliterated. A sweet romance and knee-slapping funny scenes.",5,charming twist on nostalgia,1122336000,"07 26, 2005",2005,2420,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'movie', 'version', 'Bewitched', 'stomach', 'made', 'disgusting', 'flips', 'was', 'something', 'so', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'endearing', '60s', 'TV', 'show', 'obvious', 'overt', 'involvement', 'witchcraft', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'had', 'beauty', 'sweetness', 'make', 'dark', 'art', 'appear', 'be', 'sanctioned', 'somewhere', 'book', 'Leviticus', 'grew', 'up', 'wishing', 'Paul', 'Lynde', 'Uncle', 'Arthur', 'was', 'uncle', 'had', 'sweet', 'aunt', 'dear', 'Aunt', 'Clara', 'was', 'grateful', 'never', 'lived', 'next', 'Gladys', 'Kravitz.How', 'earth', 'could', 'anyone', 'bring', 'cast', 'back', 'dead', 'literally', 'capture', 'sweetness', 'thereof', 'clever', 'twist', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'well-known', 'washed-up', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'one', 'worst', 'money-losing', 'flops', 'movie', 'history', 'given', 'opportunity', 'bring', 'beloved', '1960s', 'sit-com', 'back', 'small', 'screen', 'Eager', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'spotlight', 'regain', 'lost', 'glory', 'discovers', 'unknown', 'be', 'co-star', 'Nikole', 'Kidman', 'somehow', 'channels', 'Elizabeth', 'Montgomery', 'just', 'charming', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'former', 'Bewitched', 'star.There', 'language', 'here', 'there', 'charming', 'innocence', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'seen', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'adults', 'animated', 'fare', 'cheesy', 'talking', 'animal', 'flicks.Ferrell', 'shines', 'pitiful', 'pup', 'falling', 'innocent', 'truly', 'witchy', 'Kidman', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'perfect', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Endora', 'clever', 'sweet', 'dialogue', 'throughout.I', 'remember', 'reading', 'review', 'shortly', 'film', 'debuted', 'was', 'titled', 'amount', 'magic', 'can', 'save', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'disagree', 'more', 'really', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'film', 'assuming', 'was', 'doomed', 'failure', 'conception', 'urging', 'friends', 'joined', 'see', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'truly', 'delighted', 'uncanny', 'innocence', 'way', 'film', 'ribbing', 'itself.If', ""'re"", 'raising', 'kids', 'avoid', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'other', 'inklings', 'witchcraft', 'certainly', 'not', 'family', 'fare', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'tired', 'having', 'eyes', 'besieged', 'sexual', 'antics', 'toilet', 'humor', 'violence', 'film', 'nice', 'retreat', 'are', 'pre-marital', 'bed-hopping', 'scenes', 'language', 'comparable', 'prime-time', 'TV', 'what', 'worth', 'other', 'cute', 'slapstick', 'one', 'shot', 'cut', 'obliterated', 'sweet', 'romance', 'knee-slapping', 'funny', 'scenes']",N/A

It kind of touches bases with the old show but really, it's almost completely different with a lot of refferences to the TV show. I diskliked how the relationships went in the movie.

This move is really bad. Also, be sure if your taking the kids, they are at least 10 years old and up. There was tons of Adult referrences in this.

To ensure that he is the star, he insists that the actress playing the role of Samantha is a complete unknown whose only talent is nose-twinkling. He also insists that she gets no speaking parts. Samantha is more of a prop than a character. You don't even get to see Samantha's face in the opening credits of the new show. Just imagine how boring ""Bewitched"" would be if Samantha had no speaking parts. And the movie is no better!The movie's secondary theme almost overwhelms the premise, and unfortunately it is just as underwhelming as the premise. ""Bewitched"" takes plenty of shots at the excesses of Hollywood, but again the script is so bad that it unwittingly stands out as the best example of the excesses of Hollywood.And wouldn't you know it, but the completely unknown person who gets to play Samantha happens to be a real witch who happens to want to give up the charmed life and marry a mere mortal. All she desires is a man who needs her. Apparently, warlocks don't need anybody. Isabel (Nicole Kidman) looks absolutely beautiful in this movie, and to be painfully honest, looking at her was the only thing that kept me watching. But the voice she used nearly drove me to stop watching. For whatever reason - the director? - she affected the voice of a naive, even emotionally infantile, little girl. She seems far more addled than her Aunt Clara. There is absolutely no chemistry between Ferrell and Kidman, which is okay, I suppose, because I didn't expect hot sexuality, but the romantic scenes, such as they are, are awkward.For a movie about witches, there is surprisingly little about witches. The witchcraft is almost incidental, and with or without it this film is a bad romantic comedy. The cameos of Endora, Aunt Clara, and Uncle Arthur are horrendously bad. Nigel (Michael Caine), as Isabel's father, just seems to be reading his lines and I wonder why he ever agreed to do it. He is a Casanova who never tires of putting spells on young mortal women in order to bed them. Some people might call that rape.This movie does not pay homage to the TV series and it doesn't induce any pleasant feelings of nostalgia. It's even worse than the reprisal of ""Columbo"" called ""Mrs. Columbo."" And it's not true what Will Ferrell (as Jack Wyatt) said: I DID notice when they changed Darrin in the original TV series.

The studio and the producers could have done so much more with this film, but they got lazy and obviously didn't care enough. When I heard they were making ""Bewitched"" into a full-length feature film I thought they would pretty much follow the script of the original series, where Darren and Samantha meet, fall in love, have Endora interferring in their marriage, and ultimately have baby Tabitha. This wasn't the case. The movie is about a real witch who is going to be cast in a remake of the TV series. I tried to like the film, but simply can't. A borring and rediculous attempt to cash in on the success of a wonderful show. If Elizabeth Montgomery were alive today I am sure she would feel the same way. Save your money and buy the television DVD's of ""Bewitched"", especially the first two seasons. They come in either black and white or color, but I'd suggest the black and white ones as this is how it was filmed back in 1964. Sorry Sony...you screwed up big time with this mess!!!

Her ""tormented"" (I use that word lightly) character who is stuck between wanting to not use magic yet feeling compelled to do so, is probably the best thing in the movie.Will Ferrell is okay in the movie.  He didn't receive that best written of part.  Of course, there are a couple scenes that are just plain Ferrell and it's there that his character becomes mildly amusing.  Michael Caine provides a decent performance and Shirley MacLaine hams it up.Hams it up is a good way to describe the rest of the movie.  Nora Ephron (director of Sleepless in Seattle) makes a movie that you would not expect Nicole Kidman in, but Meg Ryan.  The movie just screams hammed up cuteness on par with Meg Ryan's usual characters.  People who really like cutsy movies will probably have a better time than those who don't.  It's so light and cutsy that there's really nothing ever at stake.  So when the paint by number romance story fully blooms (complete with the inevitable break up) we were already expecting and waiting for it to finally happen.The other problem was that the film kept going in too many directions.  It started out as a remake, then it became a movie about movie-making, then about a man trying to get back on top in Hollywood, and finally a romance but it kept trying to do everything at once that it kind of fell apart.If it weren't for some performances in the movie, this would have at least one less star.  But the star power involved managed to save this movie from being worse than average.  As it is, it's a solid three star movie.  My recommendation is to wait for dvd.",3,Too cute,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,2104,"['When', 'first', 'heard', 'Bewitched', 'remake', 'thought', 'oh', 'great', 'tv', 'show', 'turned', 'movie', 'where', 'stretch', 'out', '30', 'minute', 'episode', 'feature', 'length', 'movie', 'Then', 'realized', 'planned', 'make', 'movie', 'making', 'remake', 'thought', 'could', 'work.Truthfully', 'only', 'reason', 'was', 'interested', 'remake', 'begin', 'was', 'lovely', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'usual', 'ray', 'light', 'new', 'Samantha', 'so', 'charmingly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'love', 'tormented', 'use', 'word', 'lightly', 'character', 'who', 'stuck', 'wanting', 'not', 'use', 'magic', 'yet', 'feeling', 'compelled', 'do', 'so', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'movie.Will', 'Ferrell', 'okay', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'best', 'written', 'part', 'course', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'decent', 'performance', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'up', 'good', 'way', 'describe', 'rest', 'movie', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'director', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'movie', 'just', 'screams', 'hammed', 'up', 'cuteness', 'par', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'usual', 'characters', 'People', 'who', 'really', 'cutsy', 'movies', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'better', 'time', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'so', 'light', 'cutsy', 'really', 'nothing', 'ever', 'stake', 'So', 'when', 'paint', 'number', 'romance', 'story', 'fully', 'blooms', 'complete', 'inevitable', 'break', 'up', 'were', 'already', 'expecting', 'waiting', 'finally', 'happen.The', 'other', 'problem', 'was', 'film', 'kept', 'going', 'too', 'many', 'directions', 'started', 'out', 'remake', 'then', 'became', 'movie', 'movie-making', 'then', 'man', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'top', 'Hollywood', 'finally', 'romance', 'kept', 'trying', 'do', 'everything', 'once', 'kind', 'fell', 'were', ""n't"", 'performances', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'one', 'less', 'star', 'star', 'power', 'involved', 'managed', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'worse', 'average', 'solid', 'three', 'star', 'movie', 'recommendation', 'wait', 'dvd']",N/A

Or if you really loved  someone and you could cast a spell on them and then they were head over heels in love with you back.

Yes, this movie is based on the tv show but it is not a direct remake of the show as most people who haven't seen this would probably expect. It is roughly about a remake of the old tv show within the movie. Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrel give great performances as usual along with Shirley McClane and Micheal Cane. The movie is not bad, it just gets a bit too silly at times. Though I like silly humor every now and then, this one seemed to over do it some. Still, Nicole and Will did good given what they had to work with. Nicole definately looks and plays the part well of the character Samantha and though Will doesn't resemble the characer of Daren, his acting definately makes up for it. I really had had no intentions of seeing this movie but a friend picked it up so I figured why not.

168750,A3M2WW0PO34B94,1404974571,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 5]","What happens when you eat too much sugar? I get headaches and my teeth ache. Nicole Kidman's head must have pounded with migraines during the production of ""Bewitched"", the convoluted, overly plotted feature film version of the television show from the late 60s.Isabel (Kidman, ""The Others"", ""Moulin Rouge"") is a nave (emphasis on `nave'), young witch who decides to move to the San Fernando Valley. She intends to give up witchcraft, to live a normal life, to become a real woman, with real problems, who falls for a mess-of-a-man who needs her. In walks Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell), a famous actor who, in an act of desperation, signs to do a television reworking of ""Bewitched"". In this version, Darrin is the central character and Jack wants to find an unknown to play Samantha. One day, at Book Soup, he spots Isabel and pleads with her to become his television wife. She falls for him and walks around doe-eyed until she realizes that he is merely trying to regain his star status. Isabel decides to get even and witchcraft is the only way.Co-written and directed by Nora Ephron (""Lucky Numbers"", ""Sleepless in Seattle, ""You've Got Mail""), the film is, unfortunately, on a par with all of her other efforts as a director - she didn't direct ""Sleepless"". In all of Ephron's films, she comes up with an interesting idea, casts good actors and then everything derails into a huge mess.Apparently, the script for ""Bewitched"" has been in development for a decade. A decade! It shows. The finished film is so over developed it is almost incredible. They couldn't merely make a film version of the television show, with Kidman and Ferrell playing Samantha and Darrin, perhaps set in 2005, they had to make a film about actors in a new television version of the old television show. Worse yet, they have scenes of Kidman and Ferrell watching the old television show and then recreating the same scenes for the new show. Huh? What?Because Kidman and Ferrell play two completely different characters, seemingly from different worlds, it never appears convincing when they start to fall in love. Ferrell's character, Jack Wyatt, is a typical stereotype of a conceited actor who is full of himself. Nothing original or interesting is done with the character. In one scene, Isabel does a little magic and Jack begins to spout gibberish instead of the lines he is supposed to say. With each take, new gibberish. This is exactly the same thing that Steve Carrel did so brilliantly in ""Bruce Almighty"". Carrel is a buddy of Ferrell and appears in the film as Uncle Arthur. So, not only is Farrell doing nothing new, he is rehashing the work of his friends? Has it already come to this?Kidman's Isabel is too nave and too waifish to be interesting or believable. Her character has a softness to her voice, throughout the entire film, which makes her, oh, okay, unbearable. Kidman has made two comedies, in two years, both of which have been terrible. Remember last summers ""The Stepford Wives""? She later blamed the failure of that film on a script that wasn't ready. I wonder what or who will blamed for the failure of ""Bewitched""?The failure has to be blamed on Ephron. After we meet the characters, the director is so intent on manipulating the story, to get to the point when Ferrell will act funny, or Kidman will get to use a little magic, that nothing seems natural or organic. Ferrell is the more successful of the two, but again, he doesn't do anything original. In one scene he tells someone ""Make me 20 cappuccinos and bring me the best one"". It's funny, but we've seen it before. Everything about the story is forced and unconvincing.Then, for some reason, the story of Isabel's life starts to have parallels to Samantha's in ""Bewitched"". Both have an Aunt Clara (Carole Shelley) and Isabel's appears to be exactly like the one in the old television show. Huh? Why? It seems like they decided at some point to switch gears. We don't want to make a straight forward remake. Oh, wait. Yes, we do.The film has a great cast. But they are wasted.  Michael Caine plays Isabel's dad, Shirley McClaine plays a stage actress who is hired to play Endora, Steve Carrel plays Uncle Arthur. Jason Schwartzmann is Jack's agent. Of these, Schwartzmann is the most successful, perhaps because we expect the least from him. Michael Caine basically pops up in a bunch of different places, on a frozen food box, on a can of peas, walking out of a painted backdrop. The turn is amusing, but isn't as integral to the plot as it needed to be. MacLaine is wasted as Iris Smythson, a stage actress hired to play Endora. Her first appearance as Endora, as they are taping is funny. But then it seems as though her character was forgotten, as though they didn't know what to do with her.After Isabel gets the job on the television show, she forms a little clique with a PA from the show and her neighbor (Kristin Chenoweth). The three sit around and talk about revenge, putting hexes on people, etc. The idea becomes such a labored, mixed effort that it is amazing it wasn't cut out. Almost. Until you realize the rest of the film is as mixed an effort. Then it all makes perfect sense.Ephron is a skilled writer. But she apparently needs someone else to direct her material, to make it stronger, more consistent and more viable. To raise questions about scenes and characters that don't work. To make the material work. In ""Bewitched"", she doesn't have that.",2,A Mess,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,5432,"['What', 'when', 'eat', 'too', 'much', 'sugar', 'get', 'headaches', 'teeth', 'ache', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'head',

A remake of the original would be a travesty!Kidman is luminous as always and very funny in moments as a witch who wasn't allowed to watch Bewitched when she was growing up.Caine is fab. Farrell is bearable. There are some great supporting actors.This ISN'T an especially clever movie, but it has some wonderful moments (the scene where, in her reading, Kidman's character abandons the script and comes out which such classics as needing a licence for a poisoned apple, is great fun, and Kidman discovering things like ring-pull cans etc is thoroughly charming).The weak point IMO is that Farrel is essentially rather unlikable and irritating, and really not very funny at all. Some great supporting actors and the fabulous Kidman make it a bearable little romcom which will bring back good memories of Montgomery and co in the original (and best).It isn't the greatest movie out there, but for a night in with the girls and some harmless fun, I've seen a LOT worse!

I loved the TV show as a kid, and the movie rewards fans of the TV show with getting to see most of the favorite characters, including Uncle Arthur, Aunt Clara, and even Gladys and Abner Kravitz. But instead of just trying to remake the TV show, writer-director Nora Ephron spins the old witch-tries-to-live-the-mortal-life story in a new way, by setting it in present-day Hollywood, and making a remake of the TV series a story within the story. The device works very well to give satisfying nods to the old series, while giving us a fresh witch-meets-mortal comedic love story, and poking fun at Hollywood along the way. The classic remake problem of never being able to live up to the original is circumvented by not trying to be the original. (Devotees of the genre will also appreciate the references to Bell, Book and Candle, the classic Jimmy Stewart / Kim Novak film that inspired the TV series.) Nicole Kidman could not have been more perfect at channeling Samantha. Will Ferrell was a bit over-the-top goofy in his acting at times, but it worked, since after all he was playing an over-the-top goofy actor. Michael Caine was excellent as Nicole Kidman's warlock father, appearing in the craziest places and ways, and Shirley MacLaine was brilliant as the diva actress who plays Endora. The whole movie is a bit goofy (as was the TV series), but it satisfied my nostalgia for the show and gave us some good laughs.

168756,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,1404974571,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 5]","Let's face it.  Nora Ephron lost touch.  With ultra-cute nose-wiggling Nicole Kidman as the title role, the film remake of the 60s popular TV series 'Bewitched' should have been more funny, charming, and romantic.  And the film also features TWO respected veteran Oscar-winners Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine.  Plus, strong supports from Jason Schwartzman and Kristin Chenoweth.  And is this the result?  Scattered laughs, weak story, and no romance.  The last one in particular is unforgivable.[BIG MISTAKE!!] Yes, it's a big mistake.  I'm talking about the script (by Nora Ephron and her sister Delia).  I don't know why, but they thought the newer version should NOT be about Samantha, a lovely witch who happened to have married an unsuspecting mortal.  Instead, they borrowed an idea from 'Adaptation,' and made a terribly complicated film about the TV star and crew who are about to redo 'Bewitched.'So Nicole Kidman is a witch 'Isabel' newly arrived in humans' world, who happens to be cast as 'Samantha' in the new TV series.  A self-centered has-been movie star Jack is asked to play the role of Darrin, Samantha's husband, but Jack doesn't know that he happens to be with a real witch without knowing the fact.Now I want to ask you ... Do we need a silly, convoluted situation like that?  When you get Nicole Kidman as the star?  Why not make a film in a straightforward way?  With this unnecessarily contrived set-up which killed any potential for romance, Nora Ephron trapped herself in the maze of her own make from which no one can escape, except, perhaps, the creators of 'Eternal Sunshine and Spotless Mind.'There are thankfully a few funny moments, all of which are the results of each actor's efforts.  Nicole Kidman goes unscathed, being more natural than in 'The Interpreter' and 'The Stepford Wives.'  Will Ferrell is not bad, often providing laughs with his goofy turns, but none of them has anything to do with the romantic side of the film, without which there is no point in remaking the beloved TV series.  The worst is his dream sequence in which Ferrell's character appears stark naked in TV show (yes, naked, with some parts hidden, of course).  In films like 'Old School' this is hilarious, and I like him when he does these silly things.  In here, however, it's just out of keeping and embarrassing.The sad fact is there is no chemistry between Ferrell and Kidman, and that is fatally damaging.  For the film to succeed as romantic comedy, Kidman and Ferrell must look like the couples in love like Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in 'When Harry Met Sarry...'; however, Will and Nicole remain totally incongruous to each other all through the film, and when one of them says to the other 'I love you,' I just couldn't believe what I was hearing.The film is not bad as I was led to believe, but if I write so (like many reviewers who have done the same), that's because we knew instinctively that the 'remake-within-remake' script doesn't work.  'Bewitched' could be a better film with a simple story, and perhaps we knew it before watching the film itself.",2,"For All Kidman's Wiggling Nose, 'Bewitched' Doesn't Work (We Just Need a Simple Love Story!)",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",2005,3086,"['Let', 'face', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'lost', 'touch', 'ultra-cute', 'nose-wiggling', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'title', 'role', 'film', 'remake', '60s', 'popular', 'TV', 'series', ""'Bewitched"", 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'funny', 'charming', 'romantic', 'film', 'also', 'TWO', 'respected', 'veteran', 'Oscar-winners', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'strong', 'supports', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'result', 'Scattered', 'weak', 'story', 'romance', 'last', 'one', 'particular', 'unforgivable', '[', 'BIG', 'MISTAKE', ']', 'Yes', 'big', 'mistake', ""'m"", 'talking', 'script', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'sister', 'Delia', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'thought', 'newer', 'version', 'should', 'NOT', 'be', 'Samantha', 'lovely', 'witch', 'who', 'happened', 'have', 'married', 'unsuspecting', 'mortal', 'Instead', 'borrowed', 'idea', ""'Adaptation"", 'made', 'terribly', 'complicated', 'film', 'TV', 'star', 'crew', 'who', 'are', 'redo', ""'Bewitched"", 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'witch', 'newly', 'arrived', 'humans', 'world', 'who', 'be', 'cast', ""'Samantha"", 'new', 'TV', 'series', 'self-centered', 'has-been', 'movie', 'star', 'Jack', 'asked', 'play', 'role', 'Darrin', 'Samantha', 'husband', 'Jack', ""n't"", 'know', 'be', 'real', 'witch', 'knowing', 'fact.Now', 'want', 'ask', 'Do', 'need', 'silly', 'convoluted', 'situation', 'When', 'get', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'star', 'Why', 'not', 'make', 'film', 'straightforward', 'way', 'unnecessarily', 'contrived', 'set-up', 'killed', 'potential', 'romance', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'trapped', 'maze', 'own', 'make', 'one', 'can', 'escape', 'perhaps', 'creators', ""'Eternal"", 'Sunshine', 'Spotless', 'Mind', 'are', 'thankfully', 'few', 'funny', 'moments', 'are', 'results', 'actor', 'efforts', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'unscathed', 'being', 'more', 'natural', ""'The"", 'Interpreter', ""'The"", 'Stepford', 'Wives', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'not', 'bad', 'often', 'providing', 'laughs', 'goofy', 'none', 'anything', 'do', 'romantic', 'side', 'film', 'point', 'remaking', 'beloved', 'TV', 'series', 'worst', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Ferrell', 'character', 'stark', 'naked', 'TV', 'show', 'yes', 'naked', 'parts', 'hidden', 'course', 'films', ""'Old"", 'School', 'hilarious', 'like', 'when', 'silly', 'things', 'here', 'however', 'just', 'keeping', 'embarrassing.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'chemistry', 'Ferrell', 'Kidman', 'fatally', 'damaging', 'film', 'succeed', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Kidman', 'Ferrell', 'must', 'look', 'couples', 'love', 'Meg', 'Ryan', 'Billy', 'Crystal', ""'When"", 'Harry', 'Met', 'Sarry', 'however', 'Will', 'Nicole', 'remain', 'totally', 'incongruous', 'other', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'other', 'love', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'what', 'was', 'hearing.The', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'led', 'believe', 'write', 'so', 'many', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'knew', 'instinctively', ""'remake-within-remake"", 'script', ""n't"", 'work', ""'Bewitched"", 'could', 'be', 'better', 'film', 'simple', 'story', 'perhaps', 'knew', 'watching', 'film']",N/A

Wyatt, is a declining movie star reduced to playing TV roles and demands that an unknown play Samantha in the remake of the show.  He finds Isabelle Bigelow, played by Nicole Kidman in a Hollywood bookstore, and here's where it starts to get really confusing, because Isabelle is really a witch, who like Samantha in the Bewitched TV show, is unsatisfied with her life and is looking for something different like, I don't know, maybe love.Instead of having a snooping mother hanging over her shoulder akin to Samantha's Endora, Isabelle has a snooping father named Nigel Bigelow, played admirably by Michael Caine.  However, Nigel falls for the TV show Endora, played by Shirley McLaine, who turns out to be another real witch.  And Isabelle does have an Aunt Clara, and maybe an Uncle Arthur, if Jack Wyatt wasn't just dreaming his encounter with Uncle Arthur.All in all it just gets too confusing and that's before you discover that Isabelle has the ability to rewind events like they never happened.  Over twenty minutes of the movie is erased that way.  Even more confusion because the people that got rewound are suposed to act like all of that never happened.  This, by the way, is no problem for Will Ferrill as Jack Wyatt, because his moods are all over the map.  You almost begin to think that the movie Bewitched is as much of an ego vehicle for Ferrill in real life as the show Bewitched that they are making in the movie is for Jack Wyatt.I think Will Ferrill is a great comedic talent, but I thought he was horrible in this role, he was just too over-the-top.  Kidman was perfect in her role, Caine was good as her warlock father and McClaine played Endora perfectly in a very understated way.

Bewitched offers Kidman a perfect role for her to tackle and she's pretty good at it, despite the not funny enough and flawed script kind of failed to generate maximum laughters. Kidman tries her best while not having enough chemistry with funnyman Will Ferrell, who managed to deliver some mediocre jokes and physical comic moments.Jack Wyatt(Will Ferrell) is a has-been big star desperately trying to make a comeback, and he's offered a do a remake on the old TV series Bewitched, a show about the marriage between a man and witch pretending to be a normal woman. When he insisted on hiring an unknown actress to play Samantha the female lead, he came across Isabel(Kidman) in a book store, and he instantly wanted her for the part the minute he saw the way she wiggled her nose. Jack had no idea that he had cast a real witch to play the role of a witch.Meanwhile, Nigel Bigelow(Michael Caine), Isabel's father comes to visit her for some lecture/parental guidiance, and tried to discourage her to get involved with the show and Jack. He has his funny moment when he appeared on various labels of grocery products in the supermarket scene. When he met Iris Smythson(Shirley MacLaine) who plays Endora the Mother Witch in Bewitched, they became romantically invovled without knowing that she's an undercover witch.Everything start to go wrong on the set when Isabel increasingly clash with the controlling Jack, and when she lost her patience and tolerance, she starts to retaliate with her magics. Eventually, she reveals her true identity, and it freaked the hell out of Jack. What will Jack do about the show when Isabel decides to walk out? Will he convince her to stay and give it one more chance?Ferrell had his funniest moment when Isabel used magic to trick him to do one scene repeatedly with various accents and languages. Kidman does her nose wiggle perfectly, and she gets to have fun tricking Jack's vicious separated wife. Her romantic scenes with Ferrell was not very convincing. Michael Caine is rather wasted in this film. Jason Swartzman who was brilliant in I Heart Huckabees had an insigificant supporting role as Jack's ruthless agent. He had his big scene early in the film, and the rest of time he's not worthwhile. The most disappointing thing for me was to see Shirley MacLaine in a role that could've been very funny, but she just had about fifteen minutes of screen time, and she has like two line each time she appeared.",3,What Ever Happened to Shirley MacLaine's Role?,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",2005,2803,"['Nicole', 'Kidman', 'never', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'comedy', 'actress', 'far', 'more', 'talented', 'superior', 'work', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'already', 'done', 'Practical', 'Magic', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'years', 'ago', 'repeat', 'play', 'witch', 'again', 'actually', 'good', 'see', 'do', 'light', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'having', 'done', 'string', 'serious', 'dramas', 'Bewitched', 'offers', 'Kidman', 'perfect', 'role', 'tackle', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'funny', 'enough', 'flawed', 'script', 'kind', 'failed', 'generate', 'maximum', 'laughters', 'Kidman', 'best', 'not', 'having', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'funnyman', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'who', 'managed', 'deliver', 'mediocre', 'jokes', 'physical', 'comic', 'moments.Jack', 'Wyatt', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'has-been', 'big', 'star', 'desperately', 'trying', 'make', 'comeback', 'offered', 'do', 'remake', 'old', 'TV', 'series', 'Bewitched', 'show', 'marriage', 'man', 'witch', 'pretending', 'be', 'normal', 'woman', 'When', 'insisted', 'hiring', 'unknown', 'actress', 'play', 'Samantha', 'female', 'lead', 'came', 'Isabel', 'Kidman', 'book', 'store', 'instantly', 'wanted', 'part', 'minute', 'saw', 'way', 'wiggled', 'nose', 'Jack', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'cast', 'real', 'witch', 'play', 'role', 'witch.Meanwhile', 'Nigel', 'Bigelow', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Isabel', 'father', 'visit', 'lecture/parental', 'guidiance', 'tried', 'discourage', 'get', 'involved', 'show', 'Jack', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'appeared', 'various', 'labels', 'grocery', 'products', 'supermarket', 'scene', 'When', 'met', 'Iris', 'Smythson', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'who', 'Endora', 'Mother', 'Witch', 'Bewitched', 'became', 'romantically', 'invovled', 'knowing', 'undercover', 'witch.Everything', 'start', 'go', 'wrong', 'set', 'when', 'Isabel', 'increasingly', 'controlling', 'Jack', 'when', 'lost', 'patience', 'tolerance', 'retaliate', 'magics', 'Eventually', 'true', 'identity', 'freaked', 'hell', 'Jack', 'What', 'will', 'Jack', 'do', 'show', 'when', 'Isabel', 'walk', 'out', 'Will', 'convince', 'stay', 'give', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'Ferrell', 'had', 'funniest', 'moment', 'when', 'Isabel', 'used', 'magic', 'trick', 'do', 'one', 'scene', 'repeatedly', 'various', 'accents', 'languages', 'Kidman', 'nose', 'wiggle', 'perfectly', 'have', 'fun', 'tricking', 'Jack', 'vicious', 'separated', 'wife', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'Ferrell', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'convincing', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'rather', 'wasted', 'film', 'Jason', 'Swartzman', 'who', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'had', 'insigificant', 'supporting', 'role', 'Jack', 'ruthless', 'agent', 'had', 'big', 'scene', 'early', 'film', 'rest', 'time', 'not', 'worthwhile', 'most', 'disappointing', 'thing', 'was', 'see', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'role', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'funny', 'just', 'had', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'two', 'line', 'time', 'appeared']",N/A
