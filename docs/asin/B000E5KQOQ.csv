Mostly they need to stop grieving, forgive someone, and just accept the contingencies of life.  Instead of being the director, Redford plays Einar Gilkyson, an aging ranch man with horses living in North Central Montana, close to Glacier Park.  He shares his ranch house with his friend, Mitch Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who has been debilitated by a grizzly bear attack.  Einar also tends to his horses, but his tight-lipped personality is interrupted by some of his cantankerous tirades.  He is bitter over the loss of his son who died in an automobile accident with his daughter-in-law, Jean Gilkyson (Jennifer Lopez) at the wheel.  His daily visits to his son's plot don't seem to ease the grief or bitterness, and in only becomes exacerbated when she turns up at his doorstep after leaving her abusive boyfriend to stay with him.  Giving him no notice and turning up with an unknown granddaughter doesn't exactly work as an ice breaker.The development shows how everyone must cope.  She must get over her survival guilt that festers in her father-in-law's eyes while recovering from the wounds of domestic violence.  Mitch tries to face his fears and anguish with the bear, and the girl must come to terms with a juggled family.  Sensitive and soul-bearing, 'An Unfinished Life' is a drama that matters about life and how to accept it with accepting terms no matter what it may hand out.",4,Being Able to Move On,1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1541,"['many', 'films', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'been', 'associated', ""'Ordinary"", 'People', ""'The"", 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'characters', 'are', 'hurt', 'are', 'need', 'healing', 'Mostly', 'need', 'stop', 'grieving', 'forgive', 'someone', 'just', 'accept', 'contingencies', 'life', 'Instead', 'being', 'director', 'Redford', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', 'aging', 'ranch', 'man', 'horses', 'living', 'North', 'Central', 'Montana', 'close', 'Glacier', 'Park', 'shares', 'ranch', 'house', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'Bradley', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'been', 'debilitated', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'attack', 'Einar', 'also', 'horses', 'tight-lipped', 'personality', 'interrupted', 'cantankerous', 'tirades', 'bitter', 'loss', 'son', 'who', 'died', 'automobile', 'accident', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jean', 'Gilkyson', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'wheel', 'daily', 'visits', 'son', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'ease', 'grief', 'bitterness', 'only', 'becomes', 'exacerbated', 'when', 'up', 'doorstep', 'leaving', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'stay', 'Giving', 'notice', 'turning', 'up', 'unknown', 'granddaughter', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'ice', 'breaker.The', 'development', 'how', 'everyone', 'must', 'cope', 'must', 'get', 'survival', 'guilt', 'festers', 'father-in-law', 'eyes', 'recovering', 'wounds', 'domestic', 'violence', 'Mitch', 'face', 'fears', 'anguish', 'bear', 'girl', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'juggled', 'family', 'Sensitive', 'soul-bearing', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'drama', 'matters', 'life', 'how', 'accept', 'accepting', 'terms', 'matter', 'what', 'may', 'hand', 'out']",N/A
968206,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000E5KQOQ,A Customer,"[2, 3]","Lasse Hallstrom's An Unfinshed Life rabidly divided the critics when it was released in cinemas at the end of last year. Some thought it reeked of the Hallmark school of movie-making, a calculated and generic saccharine enterpise designed to appeal to those who like run-of-the-mill predictable melodramas. Others admired the movie for the great performances of it's A-list cast. Yes - the film does have some problems - it's a little light-weight and contrived, and often smacks of conventionality, but it's also well-acted and directed, and it's portrayal of damaged characters searching to connect is quite timely and sensitively drawn.When the beautiful, young widow Jean Gilkyson (Lopez) suffers physical abuse at the hands of her abusive boyfriend (Damian Lewis), she and her 11-year-old daughter, Griff ( Becca Gardner) seeks a safe haven with her estranged father-in-law, Einar Gilkyson (Robert Redford), a rancorous, old cowboy who lives on a former Wyoming dairy farm with his invalid buddy Mitch Bradley (Morgan Freeman). Mitch was once mauled by a grizzly bear and left badly scarred and is now in constant painEinar is a grayish and emotionally frail rancher who blames Jean for the death of his young son in a car accident. Jean was the one behind the wheel, but Einar's resentment of her is just a feeble attempt to cover his own pain and anger. Einer spends his days milking the cows, and attending to his ranch, whilst also tending to Mitch.When Jean turns up, looking for a place to stay, Einer is uncharitable and unreasonable, but he gradually takes a liking to Griff, and teaches her how to milk the cow, and do truck repairs. Meanwhile, Jean finds work  at the local diner and befriends the owner, local tough girl (Camryn Manheim). She also takes a liking to the sexy town sheriff (Josh Lucas).The characters all have hidden agendas, and are damaged by life's hard knocks in lots of different ways. Jean struggles to rise above her tendency to enter into abuse relationships and worries why she picks low-rent men because she's not good enough; Einar tries to soldier on, visiting his beloved late son Griffin's grave every day, and Mitch is just as emotionally scarred as physically scarred by the bear that ravaged him.Consequently, there's lots of emotional bonding going on in An Unfinished Life: man with daughter-in-law and granddaughter, man with bear, but it's all handled deftly and competently as the movie's narrative is propelled forward. The main strength the of the film is its gorgeous production design, with Hallstrom's cinematographer, Oliver Stapleton, pulling off some astonishingly beautiful shots of the Einer's bucolic farm.The acting is top-notch with Ms. Lopez  absolutely charming as always - you really believe she is Jean and has been suffering physical abuse and has nowhere to turn. Freeman is good here even though it's the kind of ""good"" he can deliver in his sleep. But the performance of the film goes to Redford, who beautifully plays an emotionally complex broken and bitter man, who is weakened by age, and yet is still fuelled by the desire to be honorable and always do the right thing.The themes of An Unfinished Life are pretty obvious - the need to let go of anger at all costs, the pain we encounter at random in life, and the desire to reconnect with family. The movie's big metaphor appears in the form of the giant grizzly bear that Mitch eventually orders Einer to set free. Throughout much of the movie he's locked up in a steel cage, but only through freeing him can Mitch and Einer achieve some kind of emotional release and find a type of redemption for themselves and for their newly found family.

968210,AJYILFULOQ3CX,B000E5KQOQ,a man from the east coast,"[1, 1]","I bought this movie from a clearance bin; listed at only $5, I thought I'd take a chance.  I'm glad I did; it's become one of my favorite Robert Redford films.Redford plays Einar, a man in grief over the loss of his son Griffin.  Jennifer Lopez plays Einar's daughter-in-law Jean, whom Einar holds responsible.  She fell asleep at the wheel while driving, and the resulting accident caused Griffin's death.Morgan Freeman plays Redford's trusted friend Mitch, under Einar's care after having been mauled by a bear the year before.  The bear responsible for this is now in captivity; Einar wants him to remain locked up where the bear can't hurt anyone.  This turns out to be Einar's approach to life; he lives with his grief over Griffin, and fears moving forward.  Mitch, however, wants the bear set free.What's at stake in this disagreement is how the past is dealt with; should one let go of the past, move forward, release the bear in to the wild, and take one's chances?  Or should one play it safe, keep the bear locked up, even though such an animal was meant to roam free?  As one can easily see, this conflict between Einar and Mitch forms an important subplot regarding how things need to be restored to their rightful order.  This film's plot and subplot both focus on how the past figures into the present; one can act defensively, and allow the past to dictate one's choices, or one can accept that things have changed in the present, and therefore different choices need to be made.Becca Gardner plays Grif, Einar's granddaughter.  She represents just such an important choice Einar will need to make.  There's a necessity of forgiveness at work here; when Jean shows up on Einar's doorstep, broke and running from an abusive boyfriend, Einar is confronted with a painful choice.Einar allows her to stay with him for a time, largely due to Jean's revelation that Grif is his granddaughter.  If Einar chooses to reject Jean, she'll leave and take Grif with her.  So too will go Einar's chance to establish a family bond with Grif.  As the film unfolds, it's clear that Einar is coming to greatly value and love his granddaughter; the very real possibility of losing his relationship with Grif necessitates making peace with Jean.  Einar has to therefore begin to view Jean three-dimensionally.  She's not just the wife who cost him his son; she is the caring and concerned mother of his granddaughter.Here's where Jennifer Lopez puts in some first-rate acting; she doesn't shirk her character's responsibility, but neither will she wear sackcloth-and-ashes to please Einar.  She knows that he hates her, but she refuses to hate herself.  She endures her guilt, but she will not give up on life.  J.Lo really hits the ball out of the ballpark on this one; kudos to her for turning in such a complex, yet sympathetic, performance.And so the plot unfolds, with Jean's abusive boyfriend eventually showing up to ""re-claim"" her, Einar must finally make a decision.  Defend Jean and forgive her, and thereby remain in his granddaughter's life, or continue to hold on to his anger and resentment over his son's untimely death.What this film is really all about is embracing the fact that people are more than the balance between what they do right vs. what they've done wrong.  People are more than their mistakes.  Yes, this film is a bit predictable, BUT WHO CARES???  What possible difference does that make?  What really matters, folks, is that this is a good story told exceptionally well.  This story has much depth and complexity, telling us how a man goes from tunnel vision to a much more balanced view of his life and circumstances.  The real antagonist for Einar, as he comes to discover, isn't so much Jean, as it is anger and fear.  This story is told in the best possible way through first-rate acting and well-written dialog.  Although certainly predictable, this is a very satisfying, and even uplifting, film.  This is a movie that deserves critical respect, and is quite worthy of repeated viewings.Imho, this film is almost a classic, at least in the ""family"" genre.  There are light-hearted moments and moments of great tension and conflict; deep friendship, love and terrible grief are all present in abundance.  This film deals quite respectfully with its subject matter, and while it doesn't insist that the audience agree with its values and message, it does make a strong case for forgiveness.  There aren't too many films that accomplish such goals quite as well as this one does; I therefore give this film ""two thumbs up"" and recommend it to you unreservedly.",4,"A very fine, if largely unknown, film starring Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Lopez",1343088000,"07 24, 2012",2012,4592,"['bought', 'movie', 'clearance', 'bin', 'listed', 'only', '5', 'thought', ""'d"", 'take', 'chance', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'films.Redford', 'Einar', 'man', 'grief', 'loss', 'son', 'Griffin', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Einar', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jean', 'whom', 'Einar', 'responsible', 'fell', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'driving', 'resulting', 'accident', 'caused', 'Griffin', 'death.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Redford', 'trusted', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'Einar', 'care', 'having', 'been', 'mauled', 'bear', 'year', 'before', 'bear', 'responsible', 'now', 'captivity', 'Einar', 'remain', 'locked', 'where', 'bear', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'anyone', 'out', 'be', 'Einar', 'approach', 'life', 'grief', 'Griffin', 'fears', 'moving', 'forward', 'Mitch', 'however', 'bear', 'set', 'free.What', 'stake', 'disagreement', 'how', 'past', 'dealt', 'should', 'one', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'move', 'forward', 'release', 'bear', 'wild', 'take', 'one', 'chances', 'should', 'one', 'play', 'safe', 'keep', 'bear', 'locked', 'up', 'even', 'such', 'animal', 'was', 'meant', 'roam', 'free', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'see', 'conflict', 'Einar', 'Mitch', 'important', 'subplot', 'regarding', 'how', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'restored', 'rightful', 'order', 'film', 'plot', 'subplot', 'focus', 'how', 'past', 'figures', 'present', 'one', 'can', 'act', 'defensively', 'allow', 'past', 'dictate', 'one', 'choices', 'one', 'can', 'accept', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'present', 'therefore', 'different', 'choices', 'need', 'be', 'made.Becca', 'Gardner', 'Grif', 'Einar', 'granddaughter', 'just', 'such', 'important', 'choice', 'Einar', 'will', 'need', 'make', 'necessity', 'forgiveness', 'work', 'here', 'when', 'Jean', 'up', 'Einar', 'doorstep', 'broke', 'running', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Einar', 'confronted', 'painful', 'choice.Einar', 'stay', 'time', 'largely', 'due', 'Jean', 'revelation', 'Grif', 'granddaughter', 'Einar', 'chooses', 'reject', 'Jean', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'take', 'Grif', 'So', 'too', 'will', 'go', 'Einar', 'chance', 'establish', 'family', 'bond', 'Grif', 'film', 'unfolds', 'clear', 'Einar', 'coming', 'greatly', 'value', 'love', 'granddaughter', 'very', 'real', 'possibility', 'losing', 'relationship', 'Grif', 'necessitates', 'making', 'peace', 'Jean', 'Einar', 'therefore', 'begin', 'view', 'Jean', 'three-dimensionally', 'not', 'just', 'wife', 'who', 'cost', 'son', 'caring', 'concerned', 'mother', 'granddaughter.Here', 'where', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'first-rate', 'acting', ""n't"", 'shirk', 'character', 'responsibility', 'will', 'wear', 'sackcloth-and-ashes', 'please', 'Einar', 'hate', 'guilt', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'life', 'J.Lo', 'really', 'ball', 'ballpark', 'one', 'kudos', 'turning', 'such', 'complex', 'yet', 'sympathetic', 'performance.And', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'Jean', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'eventually', 'showing', 'up', 're-claim', 'Einar', 'must', 'finally', 'make', 'decision', 'Defend', 'Jean', 'forgive', 'her', 'thereby', 'remain', 'granddaughter', 'life', 'continue', 'hold', 'anger', 'resentment', 'son', 'untimely', 'film', 'really', 'about', 'embracing', 'fact', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'balance', 'what', 'do', 'right', 'vs.', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'wrong', 'People', 'are', 'more', 'mistakes', 'Yes', 'film', 'bit', 'predictable', 'BUT', 'WHO', 'CARES', 'What', 'possible', 'difference', 'make', 'What', 'really', 'matters', 'folks', 'good', 'story', 'told', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'story', 'much', 'depth', 'complexity', 'telling', 'how', 'man', 'tunnel', 'vision', 'much', 'more', 'balanced', 'view', 'life', 'circumstances', 'real', 'antagonist', 'Einar', 'discover', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'Jean', 'anger', 'fear', 'story', 'told', 'best', 'possible', 'way', 'first-rate', 'acting', 'well-written', 'dialog', 'certainly', 'predictable', 'very', 'satisfying', 'even', 'uplifting', 'film', 'movie', 'critical', 'respect', 'quite', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewings.Imho', 'film', 'almost', 'classic', 'least', 'family', 'genre', 'are', 'light-hearted', 'moments', 'moments', 'great', 'tension', 'conflict', 'deep', 'friendship', 'love', 'terrible', 'grief', 'are', 'present', 'abundance', 'film', 'quite', 'respectfully', 'subject', 'matter', ""n't"", 'insist', 'audience', 'agree', 'values', 'message', 'make', 'strong', 'case', 'forgiveness', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'films', 'accomplish', 'such', 'goals', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'therefore', 'give', 'film', 'two', 'thumbs', 'up', 'recommend', 'unreservedly']",N/A
968211,A1OTGBG66P6K5Y,B000E5KQOQ,"Amazon Customer ""MRD""","[13, 16]","After buying my copy of AN UNFINISHED LIFE on DVD starring Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Lopez, I can readily see why its release to theaters was postponed and postponed and then, for all intents and purposes, it went straight to DVD.  Any fool can see it.First here is a movie that has every opportunity to be unnecessarily violent that is portrayed with uncommon dignity and tenderness as it tells the story of a group of people, all tied together by various tragedies, who struggle to find meaning and love.  Morgan Freeman's character is the victim of a bear attack.  But do we see Freeman squealing in fear and, in the obligatory slow motion, being tossed about by the frenzied creature? Not in this movie.  We see Jennifer Lopez's character, a victim of abuse, with a bruise on her cheek. We all know how it got there and we don't need to see it.  We hear the sad tale of how Lopez's character's husband and Redford's character's son dies in a fiery car accident.  But no scenes of explosions or fires.  Not necessary.Here is a movie that tells the usual story of a child melting the heart of a vindictive grandfather but does it so well and convincingly that we forget that we have heard it all before.In a day when gay cowboys on the screen were all the rage and scandal, this movie tells the story of two men who care for one another and who (and yes, it's the right word) love each other.  When Redford's screen granddaughter assumes that the two men are gay it elicits nothing more than good-natured banter from the age-old friends.  But not what the theater going set would expect or want.  After all, it doesn't really count, it isn't really love unless there's skin involved, right?!Finally, the movie, like others by Director Lasse Hallstrom, is all about forgiveness, something that the world has absolutely not time for.  We don't want to waste time with characters that want to shed past offenses, to clear the air and to rid their mind of the bears that haunt them.

968212,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000E5KQOQ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'll admit, I'm kind of confused how this movie escaped the watchful eye of Oscar.  I'm not saying that I think it was the best film of the year, but I am saying that all the elements of this film fit nicely together, and the end result is something that is very much up Oscar's alley.`An Unfinished Life' tells the story of Einar Gilkyson and his daughter-in-law Jean.  Einar has blamed Jean for the death of his son Griffin and has since refused to speak to her, but when she shows up at his doorstep on the run from her abusive boyfriend, her daughter Griff (Einar's granddaughter) in toe, he decides to let her stay.  They form an unlikely family, with ranch hand Mitch Bradley lending his words of wisdom to try and bring Einar and Jean together.  Jean works as a waitress to contribute and finds herself flirting with a relationship with the local sheriff Crane Curtis, all the while her boyfriend Gary is desperately trying to track her down.  While Jena is working Einar is bonding with Griff and in the process leans how to forgive, and most importantly, how to let go.There is a lot of tenderness brought to this film, in a subtle and underwhelming sort of way.  Nothing seems overly heavy handed, which is a nice change of pace when considering most movies today, especially films of this nature that tend to `overdue' the sentiment and eagerly manipulate the audiences emotions.  True, we know what we are supposed to be feeling, but we achieve that feeling all on our own.The performances truly elevate the material as well.  Jennifer Lopez, who has been tampering with a decent movie career for some time now, really shines as Jean.  She proves that she is so much more than just a `romantic/comedy' actress here, delving into feelings of pain and guilt that transcended the work she did in `Enough'.  Josh Lucas is charming, which he needs to be, but sadly the script doesn't need him to be anything more and so he isn't.  Robert Redford is convincing in his sullenness, grappling his characters deep-rooted pain.I want to talk a little about Morgan Freeman for a minute.  When I reviewed `Million Dollar Baby' I mentioned that Freeman's Oscar win was undeserved and that the idea of his character was far more effective than his actual performance.  I still stand by that.  Here though, Freeman takes the VERY SAME IDEA but manages to reel in a deserving performance.  When you think about Mitch Brady, he really is Eddie Dupris (Freeman's `Million Dollar Baby' character).  He is the crippled ranch hand that Einar keeps around mostly because Mitch saved his life.  Sound familiar?  Mitch attaches himself to Jean while Einar is still resentful of her and he manages to bring the two of them together.  Sound familiar?  In all honesty they are really the same character.  Eddie embodied the better film while Mitch received the better performance.In the end `An Unfinished Life' is truly touching and moving.  It has its minor flaws, but those flaws never take away from the overall effect of the film.  Like I said, I'm really shocked that this did not get a bigger Oscar push for all the elements for Oscar are here.  I can't say that I would have nominated it anywhere, but I definitely wouldn't have shelved it as most people did, for this film deserves some attention, serious attention.",4,One of the better films you've never heard of...,1218758400,"08 15, 2008",2008,3309,"[""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'kind', 'confused', 'how', 'movie', 'escaped', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Oscar', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'think', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'am', 'saying', 'elements', 'film', 'fit', 'nicely', 'together', 'end', 'result', 'something', 'very', 'much', 'Oscar', 'alley.', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'story', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jean', 'Einar', 'blamed', 'Jean', 'death', 'son', 'Griffin', 'refused', 'speak', 'when', 'up', 'doorstep', 'run', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'daughter', 'Griff', 'Einar', 'granddaughter', 'toe', 'let', 'stay', 'form', 'unlikely', 'family', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Mitch', 'Bradley', 'lending', 'words', 'wisdom', 'try', 'bring', 'Einar', 'Jean', 'together', 'Jean', 'waitress', 'contribute', 'flirting', 'relationship', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Crane', 'Curtis', 'boyfriend', 'Gary', 'desperately', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'Jena', 'working', 'Einar', 'bonding', 'Griff', 'process', 'how', 'forgive', 'most', 'importantly', 'how', 'let', 'lot', 'tenderness', 'brought', 'film', 'subtle', 'underwhelming', 'sort', 'way', 'Nothing', 'overly', 'heavy', 'handed', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'when', 'considering', 'most', 'movies', 'today', 'especially', 'films', 'nature', 'tend', 'overdue', 'sentiment', 'eagerly', 'manipulate', 'audiences', 'emotions', 'True', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'feeling', 'achieve', 'feeling', 'own.The', 'performances', 'truly', 'elevate', 'material', 'as', 'well', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'who', 'been', 'tampering', 'decent', 'movie', 'career', 'time', 'now', 'really', 'Jean', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'romantic/comedy', 'actress', 'here', 'delving', 'feelings', 'pain', 'guilt', 'transcended', 'work', 'did', 'Enough', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'charming', 'be', 'sadly', 'script', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'anything', 'more', 'so', ""n't"", 'Robert', 'Redford', 'convincing', 'sullenness', 'grappling', 'characters', 'deep-rooted', 'pain.I', 'want', 'talk', 'little', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'minute', 'When', 'reviewed', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'mentioned', 'Freeman', 'Oscar', 'win', 'was', 'undeserved', 'idea', 'character', 'was', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'actual', 'performance', 'still', 'stand', 'Here', 'Freeman', 'VERY', 'SAME', 'IDEA', 'reel', 'deserving', 'performance', 'When', 'think', 'Mitch', 'Brady', 'really', 'Eddie', 'Dupris', 'Freeman', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'character', 'crippled', 'ranch', 'hand', 'Einar', 'around', 'mostly', 'Mitch', 'saved', 'life', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'Mitch', 'Jean', 'Einar', 'still', 'resentful', 'bring', 'two', 'together', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'honesty', 'are', 'really', 'same', 'character', 'Eddie', 'embodied', 'better', 'film', 'Mitch', 'received', 'better', 'performance.In', 'end', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'truly', 'touching', 'moving', 'minor', 'flaws', 'flaws', 'never', 'take', 'away', 'overall', 'effect', 'film', 'said', ""'m"", 'really', 'shocked', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'bigger', 'Oscar', 'push', 'elements', 'Oscar', 'are', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'would', 'have', 'nominated', 'anywhere', 'definitely', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'shelved', 'most', 'people', 'did', 'film', 'attention', 'serious', 'attention']",N/A

968214,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000E5KQOQ,Artist & Author,"[11, 15]","While some of the professional reviewers think this movie is too 'sappy' or 'Hallmark-like,"" overall it is a good story about the need to accept tragedies that happen and to give any forgiveness needed.  Failing to do this will destroy one's life. Einar lost his son in an accident, and his bitterness drove away his wife, caused him to give up real ranching, and made him into a bitter old man.  Only his longtime black hired hand stayed with him.  When Einar's daughter-in-law returned, it was only through the sad and innocent look of her 11-year-old daughter named Griff, his granddaughter, that cause him to let them stay.  Then, it was through Griff's innocence and childish hopefulness and helpfulness that Einar began to see his own bitterness and to begin to forgive.  The movie is quite realistic in that portrayal; it is very gradual, even painful, but slowly Einar begins to change.  Also, whomever wrote the script for Griff really knew little girls - everything she utters is absolutely typical of an innocent girl her age.  One can't help but hope for Griff, even start to love her, just as her grandfather is learning to do.I am grading this movie down a full grade for two reasons.  First, Einar makes a clear bash at people of faith, anyone who wants to share their belief in God.  There was no evidence of anyone doing that in the movie - it came out of the blue - and was totally unnecessary to the story.  Second, at another point Griff blurts out that she had a lesbian music teacher and that it was okay if Einar and his hand were homosexual.  They laughed at it since Einar had been married.  While it might be a logical conclusion for an eleven-year-old, we wondered what business it would be of a music teacher to let a young kid even know she was homosexual.  There is none.  So, the obvious inference of the movie is that it is okay for homosexuals to ram their agenda down people's, especially children's, throat, but it isn't okay for people of faith to share their beliefs.Fortunately, these incidents are a very minor part of an otherwise good movie about forgiveness and learning to live with tragedy.",4,Good Movie Marred by Unnecessary Agendas,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",2006,2134,"['professional', 'reviewers', 'think', 'movie', 'too', ""'sappy"", ""'Hallmark-like"", 'overall', 'good', 'story', 'need', 'accept', 'tragedies', 'happen', 'give', 'forgiveness', 'needed', 'Failing', 'do', 'will', 'destroy', 'one', 'life', 'Einar', 'lost', 'son', 'accident', 'bitterness', 'drove', 'away', 'wife', 'caused', 'give', 'up', 'real', 'ranching', 'made', 'bitter', 'old', 'man', 'Only', 'longtime', 'black', 'hired', 'hand', 'stayed', 'When', 'Einar', 'daughter-in-law', 'returned', 'was', 'only', 'sad', 'innocent', 'look', '11-year-old', 'daughter', 'named', 'Griff', 'granddaughter', 'cause', 'let', 'stay', 'Then', 'was', 'Griff', 'innocence', 'childish', 'hopefulness', 'helpfulness', 'Einar', 'began', 'see', 'own', 'bitterness', 'begin', 'forgive', 'movie', 'quite', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'very', 'gradual', 'even', 'painful', 'slowly', 'Einar', 'change', 'Also', 'whomever', 'wrote', 'script', 'Griff', 'really', 'knew', 'little', 'girls', 'everything', 'absolutely', 'typical', 'innocent', 'girl', 'age', 'One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'hope', 'Griff', 'even', 'start', 'love', 'just', 'grandfather', 'learning', 'do.I', 'am', 'grading', 'movie', 'down', 'full', 'grade', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'Einar', 'clear', 'bash', 'people', 'faith', 'anyone', 'who', 'share', 'belief', 'God', 'was', 'evidence', 'anyone', 'doing', 'movie', 'came', 'blue', 'was', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'Second', 'point', 'Griff', 'out', 'had', 'lesbian', 'music', 'teacher', 'was', 'okay', 'Einar', 'hand', 'were', 'homosexual', 'laughed', 'Einar', 'had', 'been', 'married', 'might', 'be', 'logical', 'conclusion', 'eleven-year-old', 'wondered', 'what', 'business', 'would', 'be', 'music', 'teacher', 'let', 'young', 'kid', 'even', 'know', 'was', 'homosexual', 'none', 'So', 'obvious', 'inference', 'movie', 'okay', 'homosexuals', 'ram', 'agenda', 'down', 'people', 'especially', 'children', 'throat', ""n't"", 'okay', 'people', 'faith', 'share', 'beliefs.Fortunately', 'incidents', 'are', 'very', 'minor', 'part', 'otherwise', 'good', 'movie', 'forgiveness', 'learning', 'live', 'tragedy']",N/A

It's about Jennifer Lopez being involved in an abusive relationship with her boyfriend, so she eventually escapes and drives herself and her young daughter to the little girls grandfather's farm.It turns out that the grandfather (played by Robert Redford) doesn't care for Jennifer Lopez at all since she was responsible for killing his son in a car accident.  This explains why he doesn't exactly accept Jennifer's unexpected arrival with open arms.  The daughter meanwhile is a well-behaved girl who treats people with respect and even says ""yes sir"" when it comes to making sandwiches and other chores that the grandfather expects her (and Jennifer) to do since she's living in his house after all and has to obey by his rules.  Robert's not exactly strict however- more like bossy and moody.Morgan Freeman plays the role of a man on the verge of dying and often lies in the bedroom of Redford's home, only occasionally having the energy to walk outside and watch Redford's character fix cars and other things.  They're apparently good friends.  Morgan's character hardly seems necessary to tell the story and certainly doesn't make it better, but the movie has an even bigger flaw- Jennifer Lopez's boyfriend finds out where she's living and secretly visits the house late at night (evident by the cigarettes lying on the ground that Robert Redford discovers).  However... he's basically a scared little boy the entire time.  He's never threatening or intimidating by any means.

They'd been on the curvy roads on the way to the Stampede show to take part when there was the tragic car accident, for which the father could never forgive or forget.  He spent a lot of time sitting at his son's grave and having a one-way conversation.  He tried to keep living, but just could not let the dead go.  My son, Zach, is having that same thing to deal with now that the numbness of Tristan's car accident had faded and the pain is enormous for the whole family.Griffin's death had caused them all to have 'an unfinished life,' particularly the grieving father who died slowly every day.  He milked one cow as he had sold all the stock to have enough to keep the ranch, where the son is buried.  He has the memories which he could not erase.  Griffin had wanted a life of his own, which ended much too soon.  They all felt guilt over his loss, as I did after Tristan died in April when I thought I was going to.  He mourned for a life he thought he should have had, but they soon learned that there is a reason for everything.Josh Lucas, with his blue eyes, looked like Zach used to as a young high school lad.  He was good as the sheriff who had an affair with the girl's mom, Jennifer Lopez.  A weak man is one who runs after a woman who doesn't want her.  Gary, the abusive 'boyfriend,' finds them and starts his violent streak again but this time it backfires on him, and he is on his way out of town on a bus, this time.The bear, played by Bart the Bear, has a rough time caged up in a sort of zoo, one buffalo, some llamas, two wolves, and an elephant. He is sprung from his prison by the rancher and his accomplice, who lets the gears shift on the old Mercury truck and he ends up in the hospital.  She is distraught as she tries to come to terms with her guilt, and explains that it was an accident.  That is what the widow had told her father-in-law about the time his son died, because it was a freak accident.The hired man is hanging on by a mere string as his pain is almost unbearable, but he had asked that the bear be let free to roam.  It finds him and he shows no fear, and tells it to just keep going.  He says all he ever wanted was to be a cowboy.  In the end, everything is forgiven.  The interpersonal relationships drag on as he has to face the truth when he was asked, ""Did it ever occur to you that everything can be replaced,"" and that others get dealt a bad hand sometimes, too.  Everyone needs to feel loved, thus the affair which the whole town knows about.  She felt that she should have died in place of her husband and wished that moment she fell asleep at the wheel had never happened.  She lashed out with words instead of violence as that is what she had been dealt.The ""meow"" at the end was a fitting tribute to the nameless cats he kept at the barn.  The two old men asked each other, ""Do the dead care about our lives?  They forgive us our sins.""  Each person has realized his inadequacies, and that no one is perfect.  They are asked to live there and give the girl a home where she belongs.",3,Coming To Terms With Our Mortality.,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,3772,"['film', 'produced', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'Jr.', 'was', 'filmed', 'Wyoming', 'wild', 'animals', 'as', 'well', 'ranch', 'horses', 'one', 'cow', 'lots', 'cats', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'was', 'unforgiving', 'rancher', 'who', 'had', 'lost', 'everything', 'when', 'son', 'died', 'almost', 'twelve', 'years', 'earlier', 'wife', 'left', 'sank', 'bout', 'drunkenness', 'was', 'unable', 'help', 'hired', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'badly', 'mauled', 'giant', 'bear', 'life', 'had', 'basically', 'come', 'end', 'dead', 'son', 'widow', 'eleven-year', 'old', 'granddaughter', 'played', 'marvelously', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'returned', 'home', 'range', 'fleeing', 'abusive', 'man', 'Iowa.Like', 'Jett', 'Williams', 'girl', 'was', 'born', 'death', 'dad', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'were', 'bus', 'even', 'had', 'granddad', ""'d"", 'been', 'curvy', 'roads', 'way', 'Stampede', 'show', 'take', 'part', 'when', 'was', 'tragic', 'car', 'accident', 'father', 'could', 'never', 'forgive', 'forget', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'sitting', 'son', 'grave', 'having', 'one-way', 'conversation', 'tried', 'keep', 'living', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'let', 'dead', 'go', 'My', 'son', 'Zach', 'having', 'same', 'thing', 'deal', 'now', 'numbness', 'Tristan', 'car', 'accident', 'had', 'faded', 'pain', 'enormous', 'whole', 'family.Griffin', 'death', 'had', 'caused', 'have', ""'an"", 'unfinished', 'life', 'particularly', 'grieving', 'father', 'who', 'died', 'slowly', 'day', 'milked', 'one', 'cow', 'had', 'sold', 'stock', 'have', 'enough', 'keep', 'ranch', 'where', 'son', 'buried', 'memories', 'could', 'not', 'erase', 'Griffin', 'had', 'wanted', 'life', 'own', 'ended', 'much', 'too', 'soon', 'felt', 'guilt', 'loss', 'did', 'Tristan', 'died', 'April', 'when', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'mourned', 'life', 'thought', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'soon', 'learned', 'reason', 'everything.Josh', 'Lucas', 'blue', 'eyes', 'looked', 'Zach', 'used', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'lad', 'was', 'good', 'sheriff', 'who', 'had', 'affair', 'girl', 'mom', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'A', 'weak', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'woman', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'Gary', 'abusive', ""'boyfriend"", 'violent', 'streak', 'again', 'time', 'way', 'town', 'bus', 'time.The', 'bear', 'played', 'Bart', 'Bear', 'rough', 'time', 'caged', 'up', 'sort', 'zoo', 'one', 'buffalo', 'llamas', 'two', 'wolves', 'elephant', 'sprung', 'prison', 'rancher', 'accomplice', 'who', 'gears', 'shift', 'old', 'Mercury', 'truck', 'up', 'hospital', 'distraught', 'come', 'terms', 'guilt', 'was', 'accident', 'what', 'widow', 'had', 'told', 'father-in-law', 'time', 'son', 'died', 'was', 'freak', 'accident.The', 'hired', 'man', 'hanging', 'mere', 'string', 'pain', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'had', 'asked', 'bear', 'be', 'let', 'free', 'roam', 'fear', 'just', 'keep', 'going', 'all', 'ever', 'wanted', 'was', 'be', 'cowboy', 'end', 'everything', 'forgiven', 'interpersonal', 'relationships', 'drag', 'face', 'truth', 'when', 'was', 'asked', 'Did', 'ever', 'occur', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'replaced', 'others', 'get', 'dealt', 'bad', 'hand', 'sometimes', 'too', 'Everyone', 'feel', 'loved', 'thus', 'affair', 'whole', 'town', 'felt', 'should', 'have', 'died', 'place', 'husband', 'wished', 'moment', 'fell', 'asleep', 'wheel', 'had', 'never', 'happened', 'lashed', 'out', 'words', 'instead', 'violence', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'dealt.The', 'meow', 'end', 'was', 'fitting', 'tribute', 'nameless', 'cats', 'kept', 'barn', 'two', 'old', 'men', 'asked', 'other', 'Do', 'dead', 'care', 'lives', 'forgive', 'sins', 'person', 'realized', 'inadequacies', 'one', 'perfect', 'are', 'asked', 'live', 'there', 'give', 'girl', 'home', 'where']",N/A
968223,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000E5KQOQ,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[6, 8]","Two cowboys caring for each other in a beautiful landscape. No, this is not Brokeback Mountain. AN UNFINISHED LIFE gives us a story about two men (Robert Redford as Einar and Morgan Freeman as Mitch), and the examination of a loving relationship between friends, men who care for each other in a profound way ...but it's much more than that.This story begins with Einar's daughter-in-law, Jean (Jennifer Lopez), coming back to live on Einar and Mitch's Wyoming ranch. Einar's son (Jean's husband) was killed several years ago during a car accident in which Jean was the driver. Much guilt lay between Einar and his former daughter-in-law. But when Jean arrives at the ranch, in tow she has her daughter Griff, the granddaughter Einar never knew about. Bruised and battered from an abusive relationship, Jean hopes she'll find some respite in the only place she has left to go.Daughter/granddaughter Griff (Becca Gardner) is a well-behaved young girl who helps soften the blow of their unexpected arrival at the Wyoming ranch. She looks a lot like Einar's dead son, apparently. Griff slowly enters Einar's life and we see a tempering of emotions.Mitch (Morgan Freeman) is a long-time friend and cowhand of Einar's. He was also recently mauled by a grizzly and needs a lot of care ...which Einar provides. This is the love story, but a heterosexual one, a love story of two men who care deeply for one another as if they were kin. Einar helps Mitch bathe, gives him his pain medication injections, helps him walk to chairs and outside occasionally, and cleans his bed. This is the softer side of Einar that the audience sees and we know it will emerge once Griff and Jean get further into his life.Then there's the grizzly. The bear that attacked Mitch still roams the ranch, and Mitch feels a certain connection with it. The mauling has left scars on the outside of his body as well as the inside. Mitch won't let go of the bear and asks Einar to do several things for him (""Feed the bear"" ""Take me to see it""). The bear becomes a metaphor for the unfinished lives of all the characters in the movie, Mitch's life being the one that's come closest to being finished.The other main character - which we never see - is Einar's son who happens to be buried on the property. Einar visits the grave often and speaks in hushed tones to the headstone. It is here, in these quiet moments, that we come to understand how the ending of this one young man's life ended up stopping everyone else's. Jean's (his wife) life stopped because of her guilt over the car accident in which she was the driver. Einar for losing his one and only son whom he felt he should've protected. Mitch for allowing Einar to sink into this fit of despair. And Griff for allowing her mother to remain in an abusive relationship too long.But once the family comes together, their disjointed nature takes on a sense of meaning for all of them, and their lives again move forward.Robert Redford plays his best role to date as the curmudgeon cowboy who doesn't forgive easily but has a loving nature tucked deep down inside. His grumbled comments fit in perfectly with his embittered character, Einar.Morgan Freeman is just Morgan Freeman. But he's such a powerful presence onscreen that it's tough not to enjoy every word he speaks and every mannerism. His scarred body and relationship with the bear make for some very powerful moments.Jennifer Lopez pulls in her best performance. Her interactions with Mr. Redford were strong enough to make me understand why her rough life led her back to such an uncomfortable spot on the ranch.Many viewers may not like An Unfinished Life because of its slow pace, its common themes and its lack of action. This is a family story that delves deep into the meaning of letting life continue and how to allow healing in a time when it seems impossible.It's a great character movie with some of the more notable performances in a dramatic role that I've seen in quite a while.",5,Probaby Redford's Best Performance To Date,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,3974,"['Two', 'cowboys', 'caring', 'other', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'No', 'not', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'AN', 'UNFINISHED', 'LIFE', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Einar', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Mitch', 'examination', 'loving', 'relationship', 'friends', 'men', 'who', 'care', 'other', 'profound', 'way', 'much', 'more', 'that.This', 'story', 'Einar', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jean', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'coming', 'back', 'live', 'Einar', 'Mitch', 'Wyoming', 'ranch', 'Einar', 'son', 'Jean', 'husband', 'was', 'killed', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'car', 'accident', 'Jean', 'was', 'driver', 'Much', 'guilt', 'lay', 'Einar', 'former', 'daughter-in-law', 'when', 'Jean', 'ranch', 'tow', 'daughter', 'Griff', 'granddaughter', 'Einar', 'never', 'knew', 'Bruised', 'battered', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'Jean', ""'ll"", 'find', 'respite', 'only', 'place', 'left', 'go.Daughter/granddaughter', 'Griff', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'well-behaved', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'soften', 'blow', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'Wyoming', 'ranch', 'lot', 'Einar', 'dead', 'son', 'apparently', 'Griff', 'slowly', 'Einar', 'life', 'see', 'tempering', 'emotions.Mitch', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'long-time', 'friend', 'cowhand', 'Einar', 'was', 'also', 'recently', 'mauled', 'grizzly', 'lot', 'care', 'Einar', 'love', 'story', 'heterosexual', 'one', 'love', 'story', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'care', 'deeply', 'one', 'were', 'kin', 'Einar', 'Mitch', 'bathe', 'pain', 'medication', 'injections', 'walk', 'chairs', 'outside', 'occasionally', 'bed', 'softer', 'side', 'Einar', 'audience', 'sees', 'know', 'will', 'emerge', 'once', 'Griff', 'Jean', 'get', 'further', 'life.Then', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'attacked', 'Mitch', 'still', 'ranch', 'Mitch', 'certain', 'connection', 'mauling', 'left', 'scars', 'outside', 'body', 'as', 'well', 'inside', 'Mitch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'bear', 'Einar', 'do', 'several', 'things', 'Feed', 'bear', 'Take', 'see', 'bear', 'metaphor', 'unfinished', 'lives', 'characters', 'movie', 'Mitch', 'life', 'being', 'one', 'come', 'closest', 'being', 'finished.The', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'never', 'see', 'Einar', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'buried', 'property', 'Einar', 'grave', 'often', 'speaks', 'hushed', 'tones', 'headstone', 'here', 'quiet', 'moments', 'come', 'understand', 'how', 'ending', 'one', 'young', 'man', 'life', 'ended', 'up', 'stopping', 'everyone', 'else', 'Jean', 'wife', 'life', 'stopped', 'guilt', 'car', 'accident', 'was', 'driver', 'Einar', 'losing', 'one', 'only', 'son', 'whom', 'felt', 'should', ""'ve"", 'protected', 'Mitch', 'allowing', 'Einar', 'sink', 'fit', 'despair', 'Griff', 'allowing', 'mother', 'remain', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'too', 'long.But', 'once', 'family', 'together', 'disjointed', 'nature', 'sense', 'meaning', 'lives', 'again', 'move', 'forward.Robert', 'Redford', 'best', 'role', 'date', 'curmudgeon', 'cowboy', 'who', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'easily', 'loving', 'nature', 'tucked', 'deep', 'down', 'inside', 'grumbled', 'comments', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'embittered', 'character', 'Einar.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'just', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'such', 'powerful', 'presence', 'onscreen', 'tough', 'not', 'enjoy', 'word', 'mannerism', 'scarred', 'body', 'relationship', 'bear', 'make', 'very', 'powerful', 'moments.Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'best', 'performance', 'interactions', 'Mr.', 'Redford', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'make', 'understand', 'why', 'rough', 'life', 'led', 'back', 'uncomfortable', 'spot', 'ranch.Many', 'viewers', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'slow', 'pace', 'common', 'themes', 'lack', 'action', 'family', 'story', 'deep', 'meaning', 'letting', 'life', 'continue', 'how', 'allow', 'healing', 'time', 'when', 'impossible.It', 'great', 'character', 'movie', 'more', 'notable', 'performances', 'dramatic', 'role', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while']",N/A

No longer speaking, nowhere near, no grave to visit, no unknown granddaughter to bring us together, no bear which forces us to face our fears. How do we learn to Love?Love this film, love the soundtrack, the music, the vistas, the views; I have watched it three times in a row right now. If only life could be likethis. How can we do it? Questions remain.I personally did not like Robert Redford's character. His rage is outstanding, inappropriate and wrong. He is not much different than the young man that took his anger out on Jennifer. He just uses words with women and fists with men. In a normal place, he would be in jail for his behavior. The worst of it is that he isn't even drinking anymore, and his rage and violence remains. It's so ""American"" to make the hero an angry warmonger. Out of the entire cast and film, this was my only complaint. When Captain Call in Lonesome Dove (Tommy Lee Jones) behaved this way, at least he knew he had overreacted, and felt some sense of shame. Redford shows none. What did he learn about ""accidents"" and forgiveness and rage? That ""the bad guy"" still ""deserves it?""I could see Mickey Rourke acting in this part with the ice-cold smoldering anger he carries to his films, but Redford? Never. Didn't like it at all. The day would come all too soon when the daughter-in-law or granddaughter would do ""something"" to instigate his ire, and then LOOK OUT.Everything else was fantastic, Freeman (of course), the young grand daughter, and Jennifer Lopez was excellent.

His movies are always full of life. Now, he directs this simple but poignant story of two old friends, of family, of forgiveness and loss.  Robert Redford plays Einar Gilkyson, an old rancher living in a small town in Wyoming. Morgan Freeman plays Mitch Bradley, Einar's best friend who was mauled by a bear and now needs Einar to take care of him.  Jennifer Lopez plays Jean Gilkyson, the daughter-in-law of Einar. Her husband, Einar's son, died many years ago and is buried near Einar's place in Wyoming. Einer still visits his son's grave everyday along with other rituals he has. Jean leaves her abusive boyfriend in Iowa and goes to Wyoming because she has nowhere else to go, even though she is estranged from her father-in-law, Einer. Becca Gardner plays Jean's daughter Griff Gilkyson (also daughter of Einer's deceased son), who must acquaint herself with the grandfather she never knew. All of the performances in this movie are top notch. The basic story evolves as we watch the changes in the lives of these characters and the kinship that builds between them.

968255,A3HD7SVBY4JZOW,B000E5KQOQ,Donegal Dan,"[6, 6]","There was so little buzz about this movie that I almost passed it by. That would have been a big mistake.  As many reviewers have said, the story is predictable but that doesn't make it a bad story.  In fact it is a timeless story of grief, forgiveness and humor.  I found it completely absorbing and really didn't want it to end.  All the actors in it were excellent--Redford very natural and believable as the embittered grandfather; Morgan Freeman his usual competent self as the humorous voice of friendship and reason; Jennifer Lopez handling the part of the unwanted daughter-in-law like a pro--low-key and appealing; Becca Gardner outstanding as the young granddaughter--attractive and lovable without any of the cutseyness that haunts so many child performances; Josh Lucas his usual sexy and competent self as the sheriff; Camryn Manheim fine as the local cafe owner; and Damien Lewis excellent in his small role as the abusive boyfriend (a role, incidentally, that really doesn't give this fine actor much of a chance to shine--see him in Band of Brothers or The Forsythe Saga for a better showcase of his talents).  The only part of this involving film that seemed to me a bit off the mark was the grizzly bear thing, where I think they got a little carried away.  However, even the bear was impressive and the special feature on the training of Bart the Bear was an added pleasure.

968257,A2TXR85WQLE32N,B000E5KQOQ,D. S. Thurlow,"[0, 0]","2005's ""An Unfinished Life"" is a slow, considered, thoughtful movie about relationships, about how they can get damaged, and sometimes, how they can be fixed.  A grizzled-looking Robert Redford leads as Einar Gilkyson, a cranky Wyoming rancher with a dead son, a drinking problem, and the care of best friend Mitch (a superb Morgan Freeman) mangled in a bear attack that Einar failed to prevent.  One day, up the dirt road comes long-lost daughter in law Jean (Jennifer Lopez), whom Einar blames for his son's death, with a granddaughter named Griff that he has never met.  Behind Jean and Griff on the road is an abusive ex-boyfriend named Gary (an under-used Damian Lewis).If the storyline that follows is somewhat predictable, the delivery is a joy to watch, as a group of talented actors go through their paces.  Jean and Einar can't quite work it out at first, and Jean moves back to town, there to befriend the local sheriff.  The young Griff (Becca Gardner) decides to stay with her grandfather and learn about the ranch life.  She turns out to be the catalyst that gets Einar and Mitch out of their respective ruts and on the way to being healed.There are a couple of exciting scenes involving the bear that mangled Mitch, and there is a dramatic and cathartic confrontation between Einar and Jean's ex-boyfriend late in the movie, but for the most part, this is about people interacting in very human and imperfect ways.  ""An Unfinished Life"" probably didn't get the attention it deserved when first released.  It is highly recommended to those willing to give it a second chance.

968259,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000E5KQOQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 8]","Nearing seventy, Robert Redford has nary a trace of his golden boy aura as he submerges convincingly into the bitter curmudgeon he plays in this well meaning but lugubrious 2005 soap opera set in modern-day Wyoming. As aging rancher Einar Gilkyson, he brings a nice grizzled quality to a role that plays well to his screen legacy, but given his renowned love of Utah and the number of frontiersmen he has played in his career (""Jeremiah Johnson"", ""The Electric Horseman"", ""The Horse Whisperer""), his performance fails to surprise for the most part. In fact, predictability appears to be a pervasive problem throughout the well-trodden material co-written by Mark Spragg (based on his book) and Virginia Korus Spragg. The other significant problem is the lethargic pacing provided by director Lasse Hallstrom to give the subject matter a greater sense of self-importance. Neither factor completely torpedoes the movie, but it certainly adds to the burden of absorbing the drama presented.The familiar plot focuses on the unexpected arrival of Einar's daughter-in-law Jean at his ranch with her eleven year-old daughter Griff in tow. Jean is escaping an abusive relationship with an obsessed live-in boyfriend. The film's primary conflict comes from the fact that Einar resents Jean for what he sees as her culpability in his son's car accident death over a decade earlier. Meanwhile, Einar takes care of lifelong friend Mitch, who has been mauled by a bear and now lives in relative isolation in an adjacent cabin. As a rather unsubtle metaphor, the fearsome bear (played by Bart II) represents the seemingly insurmountable barriers the characters face which prevent them from moving on with their lives. We can see where all the plot developments are heading from the outset, and the story is structured in a domino-like fashion that peels layers away from characters while solving their problems in quick succession.Fortunately, a fine cast has been assembled to support Redford starting with the redoubtable Morgan Freeman as Mitch. However, as with Redford, an overt sense of familiarity marks his performance as well, as he again plays the sturdy, philosophical sidekick like he did in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"". More focused than she has been recently in films, Jennifer Lopez does solid work as Jean, probably her best performance since Steven Soderbergh's 1998 ""Out of Sight"", but it is a very similar role to the battered wife she played in 2002's ""Enough"". Josh Lucas is wasted in the passive role of the local sheriff, and Damian Lewis and Camryn Manheim seem only to serve as convenient plot devices as Jean's white-trash boyfriend and the supportive cafe owner respectively. Becca Gardner is the one pleasant surprise as she plays Griff in a blessedly unaffected manner.For all its faults, including a way too pat ending, the film has moments of genuine poignancy and light humor that keep it from falling completely to the wayside. It also helps that Oliver Stapleton's cinematography captures the beautiful Wyoming vistas quite nicely. The DVD extras are pretty basic. There is an insightful audio commentary track by Hallstrom, producer Leslie Holleran, and editor Andrew Mondshein (though no one from the cast), which actually does help one appreciate the overriding themes more than simply viewing the movie. Two brief featurettes are also included - the standard making-of short with snippets of interviews with the filmmakers and the principal cast and another one focused on the training of the relatively docile Bart II to look menacing for the film.",3,Solid Cast and Poignant Moments Cannot Hide Interminable Film Far from Unfinished,1145750400,"04 23, 2006",2006,3598,"['Nearing', 'seventy', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'nary', 'trace', 'golden', 'boy', 'aura', 'convincingly', 'bitter', 'curmudgeon', 'well', 'meaning', 'lugubrious', '2005', 'soap', 'opera', 'set', 'modern-day', 'Wyoming', 'aging', 'rancher', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', 'nice', 'grizzled', 'quality', 'role', 'well', 'screen', 'legacy', 'given', 'renowned', 'love', 'Utah', 'number', 'frontiersmen', 'played', 'career', 'Jeremiah', 'Johnson', 'Electric', 'Horseman', 'Horse', 'Whisperer', 'performance', 'surprise', 'most', 'part', 'fact', 'predictability', 'be', 'pervasive', 'problem', 'well-trodden', 'material', 'co-written', 'Mark', 'Spragg', 'based', 'book', 'Virginia', 'Korus', 'Spragg', 'other', 'significant', 'problem', 'lethargic', 'pacing', 'provided', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'give', 'subject', 'matter', 'greater', 'sense', 'self-importance', 'factor', 'completely', 'movie', 'certainly', 'burden', 'absorbing', 'drama', 'presented.The', 'familiar', 'plot', 'focuses', 'unexpected', 'arrival', 'Einar', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jean', 'ranch', 'eleven', 'year-old', 'daughter', 'Griff', 'tow', 'Jean', 'escaping', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'obsessed', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'film', 'primary', 'conflict', 'fact', 'Einar', 'resents', 'Jean', 'what', 'culpability', 'son', 'car', 'accident', 'death', 'decade', 'earlier', 'Meanwhile', 'Einar', 'care', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Mitch', 'who', 'been', 'mauled', 'bear', 'now', 'relative', 'isolation', 'adjacent', 'cabin', 'rather', 'unsubtle', 'metaphor', 'fearsome', 'bear', 'played', 'Bart', 'II', 'seemingly', 'insurmountable', 'barriers', 'characters', 'face', 'prevent', 'moving', 'lives', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'plot', 'developments', 'are', 'heading', 'outset', 'story', 'structured', 'domino-like', 'fashion', 'layers', 'away', 'characters', 'solving', 'problems', 'quick', 'succession.Fortunately', 'fine', 'cast', 'been', 'assembled', 'support', 'Redford', 'starting', 'redoubtable', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Mitch', 'However', 'Redford', 'overt', 'sense', 'familiarity', 'marks', 'performance', 'as', 'well', 'again', 'sturdy', 'philosophical', 'sidekick', 'did', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'More', 'focused', 'been', 'recently', 'films', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'solid', 'work', 'Jean', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'Steven', 'Soderbergh', '1998', 'Out', 'Sight', 'very', 'similar', 'role', 'battered', 'wife', 'played', '2002', 'Enough', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'wasted', 'passive', 'role', 'local', 'sheriff', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'seem', 'only', 'serve', 'convenient', 'plot', 'devices', 'Jean', 'white-trash', 'boyfriend', 'supportive', 'cafe', 'owner', 'respectively', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'one', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'Griff', 'blessedly', 'unaffected', 'manner.For', 'faults', 'including', 'way', 'too', 'pat', 'ending', 'film', 'moments', 'genuine', 'poignancy', 'light', 'humor', 'keep', 'falling', 'completely', 'wayside', 'also', 'Oliver', 'Stapleton', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'Wyoming', 'vistas', 'quite', 'nicely', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'pretty', 'basic', 'insightful', 'audio', 'commentary', 'track', 'Hallstrom', 'producer', 'Leslie', 'Holleran', 'editor', 'Andrew', 'Mondshein', 'one', 'cast', 'actually', 'help', 'one', 'appreciate', 'overriding', 'themes', 'more', 'simply', 'viewing', 'movie', 'Two', 'brief', 'featurettes', 'are', 'also', 'included', 'standard', 'making-of', 'short', 'snippets', 'interviews', 'filmmakers', 'principal', 'cast', 'one', 'focused', 'training', 'relatively', 'docile', 'Bart', 'II', 'look', 'menacing', 'film']",N/A

The unique friendship between Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman is extremely touching.Freeman, in his character in the movie, was attacked by a bear which left him in tremendous pain and partially paralyzed.  Redford, in his role, is the ever so loyal friend who administers morphine shots to Freeman every morning and takes good care of him by helping him change, cooks his meals and plays cards together.JLo's character is one who finally decides to get out of an abusive relationship by escaping the wrath of her boyfriend by retreating back to her late husband's father's (played by Redford) home.  She takes her young daughter and they leave to go to the ranch in the middle of no where.What the viewer learns through the movie is that Redford is still agonizing over his son's death - JLo's late husband - and has yet to forgive JLo for what happened.  Eventually, Redford finds it in his heart to forgive her, although it was not her fault, and opens his heart to his daughter-in-law and granddaughter - who happens to be the spitting image of her late father.It was a bear, a young girl, and the sight of an abusive boyfriend which finally brought Redford to move on with his life and welcome his family back into his life after shunning them out for years.A great movie to watch!",4,Domestic Violence.

We bought it only because the talent of this film assured us we should have it in our collection, but we had never heard of it.Morgan Freeman provides an amazing performance as a ranch hand who was mauled by a bear a year before the plot takes place. He went from a highly independent man, capable of working all day, to a bed ridden individual who requires assistance for most daily chores.Robert Redford, as a Wyoming rancher named Einar, is simply superb. Einar takes care of his dear friend and ranch hand, played by Morgan Freeman. He is always caring and attentive, but we come to understand that there are issues of guilt because he was under the influence when the accident happened and could, therefore, not save his friend from the bear's attack.Jennifer Lopez plays the role of the widowed daughter in law of Einar, who is in the middle of an abusive relationship. Her young daughter and granddaughter of Einar, makes her leave this relationship, and the two go to live in Wyoming... because there is no other place to go without money and employment.The women are not well received by Einer. He feels Jennifer Lopez is responsible for the death of his only son. The welcoming scene between Robert Redford and Jennifer Lopez is simply excellent.

Although predictable, it is graced with fine performances by its veteran stars and a really nice turn by its youngest. It in fact kept me up two hours longer than I had planned; I only meant to watch a few minutes after coming home from work, and ended up absorbed enough to finish it.Jennifer Lopez, playing Jean, a single mother in an unnamed Iowa town, suffers abuse from her boyfriend for the last time (haven't we already been down this cinematic road with her?) and takes her 11-year-old daughter, escaping from the  situation in an anywhere-but-here moment at the beginning of the movie. They run out of options and money and go to the only bolthole Jean can think of to regroup - her bitter father-in-law Einar, a semi-retired ranch owner in Wyoming. Einar doesn't want her - he blames her for the accidental death in a car crash of his son, 11 years prior - and is not aware that he has a granddaughter, who looks remarkably like his son. He grudgingly accepts them and an uneasy truce forms between Jean and Einar, with the understanding that the mother and daughter will stay only long enough to get back on their feet.Observing all this in his usual sage way from across the road is Morgan Freeman, playing Mitch, Einar's ranch hand, who the previous year was mauled by a bear and is undergoing a painful recovery, still largely bedridden and patiently attended to by Einar. Mitch has a strange affinity for the bear that almost killed him and, when it is captured near town and put in a small zoo nearby, insists on Einar looking in on it occasionally to make sure it is OK. Einar's granddaughter,11-year-old Griff, quite naturally gets involved in this venture, and that,with her other childhood activities, goes its way toward endearing her to her gruff grandfather.Robert Redford as Einar plays his role as it should be played, as the embittered old man deprived of the one person who he really cared about and who focuses on Jean as the cause of his loss. His granddaughter proves to be the wild card, and is aided by Mitch, who watches everything happening from his observation post across the road and provides the catalyst for change. Morgan Freeman - really the reason I rented the movie, as I don't think he's capable of a bad performance - is great as the invalid old ranch hand, forgiving and benevolent, who sees the necessity in getting past emotional obstacles and moving on.Jennifer Lopez was a nice surprise - who knew she could act this well - playing a woman on the edge of desperation with just the right intensity. Her character does have the unerring knack of finding the right person (or persons) to come to her defense; upon landing a job in town her first day, she homes in on not only the town sheriff but the town's most formidable cafe worker, making a romantic partner of the sheriff and a valuable ally out of the cafe worker. Her daughter, played by Becca Gardner, more than holds her own amongst the adults; she is polite and respectful (a nice change to the kids you routinely see nowadays in film) but still manages to get her point across when necessary.Overall, while this movie is pretty Hallmarkian in tone (be warned; there are two or three scenes definitely NOT Hallmark material), it did not lag; the acting was good, especially from Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford; and the scenery is breathtaking. Lately Hollywood has been making good use of the West; they can continue, as far as I'm concerned.

968272,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B000E5KQOQ,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[0, 0]","AN UNFINISHED LIFEHave you ever watched something and thought man that was a great movie, but once it sinks in you realize while it was good it came short of classic status. This movie is one of those unfortunately because it is actually a really good movie, and that is even with J-LO.  I will get to that later but let me start out with a quick little statement. Some people may have noticed I have giving lesser films a 5 star rating, I assure you I had reasons for doing so. I do not rate things side by side, I rate things based on my level of enjoyment when viewing it. Like a movie called ""Vengeance of the Dead"", that film is by no means a classic film. But when I watched it with out expectations and knowing it was a low budget film from Full Moon it was an ok movie. When I watched it again with what turned out to be a very enjoyable director's commentary it added a lot more to the film, there for with both viewings it rounded up to a 5. Like I said I do not rate things side by side if I did do it that way this film would certainly rate higher then the previous movie I mentioned above.Now with that out of the way I can get to this movie, it is with out doubt a very good movie. Writers Virginia Korus Spragg and Mark Spragg have crafted a well paced, entertaining, and at times moving film that never seems to be the preachy type. The story is of a woman named Jean Gilkyson [Lopez] who is trying to escape not only her abusive boyfriend but her life as well. Traveling along side her is her daughter Griff Gilkyson [Becca Gardner] and they make their way to Jean's ex father in law Einar Gilkyson [Robert Redford] who still blames her for his son's death. Tensions run high while they are there but along with Mitch Bradley [Morgan Freeman] Einar starts to come around as he spends time with his newly found granddaughter. Of course that is not all that happens in this movie, but the relationship between Grand father and granddaughter is the heart of this story. Director Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m did an excellent job with this film as did director of photography Oliver Stapleton who shot this beautifully. The scenery in this film is amazing, and the look of this movie is great as well. All those who worked on this movie behind the camera deserve a lot of credit.Of course the people in front of the camera make it come to life, and all of them do a great job with this film. Robert Redford of course is great as the grieving father who blames the girl for his son's loss. He is with out a doubt one of the funnier characters in the film. Of course his best friend in the film Morgan Freeman is excellent , did you think other wise? Freeman in particular is great as the friend who was mauled by a bear and now is disfigured and unable to move or walk with out help. He is one of the funnier characters when argues with Redford's character yet is also one of the saddest in the film. Josh Lucas who plays the town sheriff portrays his character well and is very believable in his role, as is Becca Gardner who plays the granddaughter. She in particular does a marvelous job on this film, and that is a compliment since most child actors usually are not that great. Remember earlier when I said I would come to that later in reference to J-Lo, well now is the time. I have never really been a fan of this woman, especially when it comes to her music. But some thing about her annoys me, maybe it is how she acts outside of the movies. But with that aside she actually did an excellent job on this film, I have not been this impressed with her since ""Selena"". Not only is she less annoying in this film but she actually is the character and not J-Lo with a different name.Of course I did say that this film did not reach classic status in my mind, here is why. This film is pretty predictable, I am sure other people have mentioned this but you can guess what is coming for the rest of the movie after the 20 minute mark. And while that will not kill the mood of the film it will draw down the surprise of certain situations. Another problem you will have to deal with is the character development, it goes by to fast. Don't get me wrong these are definitely strong well rounded characters but I wish they had more time to develop with each other. The relationships seem to form out of no where, this film could have been great if it had a little more time added to it in my mind.But with scenes that involve the bear and the boy friend taking place this film still ranks pretty high, I recommend seeing this to any and every body. Rent it first to see if it is for you, but if you like it I think it is worth owning. Give it a chance and see how you feel, even if you do not like it I don't think you will say it is not worth seeing.",4,A REALLY GOOD FILM,1221350400,"09 14, 2008",2008,4753,"['UNFINISHED', 'LIFEHave', 'ever', 'watched', 'something', 'thought', 'man', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'once', 'realize', 'was', 'good', 'came', 'short', 'classic', 'status', 'movie', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'actually', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'even', 'J-LO', 'will', 'get', 'later', 'let', 'start', 'out', 'quick', 'little', 'statement', 'people', 'may', 'have', 'noticed', 'have', 'giving', 'lesser', 'films', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'assure', 'had', 'reasons', 'doing', 'so', 'do', 'not', 'rate', 'things', 'side', 'side', 'rate', 'things', 'based', 'level', 'enjoyment', 'when', 'viewing', 'movie', 'called', 'Vengeance', 'Dead', 'film', 'means', 'classic', 'film', 'when', 'watched', 'out', 'expectations', 'knowing', 'was', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'Full', 'Moon', 'was', 'ok', 'movie', 'When', 'watched', 'again', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'director', 'commentary', 'added', 'lot', 'more', 'film', 'viewings', 'rounded', 'up', '5', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'rate', 'things', 'side', 'side', 'did', 'do', 'way', 'film', 'would', 'certainly', 'rate', 'higher', 'then', 'previous', 'movie', 'mentioned', 'above.Now', 'way', 'can', 'get', 'movie', 'out', 'doubt', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'Writers', 'Virginia', 'Korus', 'Spragg', 'Mark', 'Spragg', 'have', 'crafted', 'well', 'paced', 'entertaining', 'times', 'moving', 'film', 'never', 'be', 'preachy', 'type', 'story', 'woman', 'named', 'Jean', 'Gilkyson', '[', 'Lopez', ']', 'who', 'trying', 'escape', 'not', 'only', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'life', 'well', 'Traveling', 'along', 'side', 'daughter', 'Griff', 'Gilkyson', '[', 'Becca', 'Gardner', ']', 'make', 'way', 'Jean', 'ex', 'father', 'law', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', '[', 'Robert', 'Redford', ']', 'who', 'still', 'son', 'death', 'Tensions', 'run', 'high', 'are', 'there', 'Mitch', 'Bradley', '[', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', ']', 'Einar', 'come', 'around', 'time', 'newly', 'found', 'granddaughter', 'course', 'not', 'movie', 'relationship', 'Grand', 'father', 'granddaughter', 'heart', 'story', 'Director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstr', 'ouml', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'did', 'director', 'photography', 'Oliver', 'Stapleton', 'who', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'scenery', 'film', 'amazing', 'look', 'movie', 'great', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'worked', 'movie', 'camera', 'lot', 'credit.Of', 'course', 'people', 'front', 'camera', 'make', 'come', 'life', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'film', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'course', 'great', 'grieving', 'father', 'who', 'girl', 'son', 'loss', 'out', 'doubt', 'one', 'funnier', 'characters', 'film', 'course', 'best', 'friend', 'film', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'did', 'think', 'other', 'wise', 'Freeman', 'particular', 'great', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'mauled', 'bear', 'now', 'disfigured', 'unable', 'move', 'walk', 'out', 'help', 'one', 'funnier', 'characters', 'when', 'argues', 'Redford', 'character', 'yet', 'also', 'one', 'saddest', 'film', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'who', 'town', 'sheriff', 'character', 'well', 'very', 'believable', 'role', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'who', 'granddaughter', 'particular', 'marvelous', 'job', 'film', 'compliment', 'most', 'child', 'actors', 'usually', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'Remember', 'earlier', 'when', 'said', 'would', 'come', 'later', 'reference', 'J-Lo', 'well', 'now', 'time', 'have', 'never', 'really', 'been', 'fan', 'woman', 'especially', 'when', 'music', 'thing', 'annoys', 'maybe', 'how', 'movies', 'actually', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'impressed', 'Selena', 'Not', 'only', 'less', 'annoying', 'film', 'actually', 'character', 'not', 'J-Lo', 'different', 'name.Of', 'course', 'did', 'say', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'reach', 'classic', 'status', 'mind', 'here', 'why', 'film', 'pretty', 'predictable', 'am', 'sure', 'other', 'people', 'have', 'mentioned', 'can', 'guess', 'what', 'coming', 'rest', 'movie', '20', 'minute', 'mark', 'will', 'not', 'kill', 'mood', 'film', 'will', 'draw', 'down', 'surprise', 'certain', 'situations', 'problem', 'will', 'have', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'fast', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'are', 'definitely', 'strong', 'well', 'rounded', 'characters', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'develop', 'other', 'relationships', 'seem', 'form', 'where', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'added', 'mind.But', 'scenes', 'involve', 'bear', 'boy', 'friend', 'taking', 'place', 'film', 'still', 'pretty', 'high', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'body', 'Rent', 'first', 'see', 'like', 'think', 'worth', 'owning', 'Give', 'chance', 'see', 'how', 'feel', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'say', 'not', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

968277,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B000E5KQOQ,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[7, 7]","Lasse Hallstrom is definitely a director drawn to character-driven dramas. He came upon a screenplay by the writing team of Mark and Virginia Spragg and he loved it. Not only were the male characters realistic and memorable, but the female characters were well written as well; especially the part of a young girl. Unlike films where the young female character had the primary point of view (TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD), this story just had a young girl whose relationship to all the primary characters carried the most dramatic weight. Hallstrom, a transplanted Swede, gained an international reputation with MY LIFE AS A DOG (1985). AN UNFINISHED LIFE (2005) continues to add to his strong string of hits, including WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE (1993), THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999), CHOCOLAT (2000), and THE SHIPPING NEWS (2001). The lucky stiff is married to actress Lena Olin, and they live in America now.The plotline for AN UNFINISHED LIFE opens in Ohio. A battered single mother, Jean (Jennifer Lopez), flees her abusive boyfriend, Gary (Damian Lewis). With her young daughter, Griff (Becca Gardner), in tow, Jean embarks on a desperate road trip. Her old beater car breaks down after 300 miles, and they are forced to abandon many of their possessions. Frightened, broke, and hungry, the pair makes their way to Wyoming. They return to Jean's home town, and drop in on her estranged father-in-law, Einer (Robert Redford). It seems that Einer did not know he had a grand daughter, and Griff had been told that her grandfather was dead. Remorse hung in the air regarding a decade old tragedy. Jean had fallen asleep at the wheel and crashed her car, killing her husband. Einer had never forgiven her. The ranch was ramshackle, and Einer was struggling to make ends meet. There was only one ranch hand left, Mitch (Morgan Freeman), and he was crippled up from a bear attackAfter his son's death, Einer became a roaring drunk. When Mitch was attacked by a grizzly, we discover, Einer was too inebriated to assist, and it nearly cost the ranch hand his life. Partly out of guilt, and out of 40 years of friendship, Einer took on the role of caregiver for Mitch. So every character had their massive regrets and secrets. As an interesting plot thread the massive grizzly that had attacked Mitch returned to the area. Oddly Mitch refused to let Einer destroy it. After the bear wandered into town, scaring half the populous, the local sheriff, Crane (Josh Lucas), along with some Fish & Game wardens tranquilized the big bear, and donated it to a local zoo for display; an odd choice at best and not too realistic. Obviously though, it was necessary to keep the bear alive, and on exhibit as a necessary dramatic catalyst within the swirl of tangled and troubled lives -assisting in the emotional changes many of the characters had to achieve.Robert Redford was excellent as Einer, refreshingly portraying a character his actual age. There was none of the matinee idol in this role. Redford's actor pals, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood had already made their career transitions into older character parts -but here to fore Redford was still able to pull off those leading man roles. His Einer was irascible, but still likeable; obstinate, troubled, angry, capable of bursts of violence and yet always gentle and compassionate with Mitch. As Mitch, Morgan Freeman had less to do, but as one might expect, he did it very well. There is always such depth, such humanity in his acting that we never seem to catch him practicing his craft.Jennifer Lopez was very convincing as the grief-stricken widow, fleeing pregnant to avoid ridicule a decade earlier, raising her daughter without in-laws. Her Jean was personally flawed and filled with self-doubt and brimming with guilt. Some critics trashed her performance, only seeing her celebrity and not her fine characterization. The fact is Lopez works hard at her craft and regardless of her personal life, one should strive to forgo being judgmental, and let the work speak for itself. We need to remember that her breakthrough role in SELENA (1997) was already her tenth film. She has been making movies since 1987. This is an actress who stunned us in U-TURN (1997), and THE CELL (2000), and who we fell in love with after seeing her in SHALL WE DANCE (2004). Becca Gardner as young Griff was bang on the mark, never missing a perfect silent response. She is a very talented young lady and if she continues to act, very undoubtedly will thrill us with her future performances. But she still has to grow up and make some choices. Not all fine young actresses persevere and become a Jodi Foster.Hallstrom does a remarkable job with his actors. Josh Lucas and Camryn Manheim had wonderful moments of cameo in several scenes. Damien Lewis was much too convincing as the sleezeball boyfriend, taking a chance on being unlikable. Bart the Bear was an important character; very convincing in his debut role (he is actually Bart II). Perhaps the plot was a bit predictable and the tone mostly sentimental, but I found it also ruggedly realistic and a touch existential. They filmed the movie in British Columbia, on the high arid plateaus between the Cascades and the Rockies -but I bought it as Wyoming. I think the movie emerged as tasty mainstream entertainment -the heartwarming kind of film that Hollywood used to be famous for -a small story told large.",4,Stoic Erosion,1185235200,"07 24,

In this very fine film AN UNFINISHED LIFE the setting is the vastness of Wyoming, in a town where everyone knows everyone and remembers everything, but the townsfolk also hold a profound respect for privacy and personal pain.Einar Gilkyson (Robert Redford) is a man in his 60's whose son was killed in an automobile accident eleven years ago, an accident in which this son's wife Jean (Jennifer Lopez) was driving.  Jean left the little town, pregnant with her daughter Griff (Becca Gardner), and has been living a life of guilt and remorse partially relieved by frequent lovers - the latest being the severely abusive Gary (Damian Lewis) whose beatings of Jean and Griff result in Jean's leaving him to go to Wyoming where she hopes Einar will allow her to board until she earns sufficient funds to move on.  Einar lives on the same little farm with his long time friend and helper Mitch (Morgan Freeman) and Einar lives with the grief of the loss of his son and with the need to tend to the ailing Mitch who was mauled by a bear.  Jean and Griff enter the town and convince the reluctant Einar to allow them temporary quarters: Jean finds work as a waitress at the local cafe run by Nina (Camryn Manheim) and meets the handsome sheriff Crane (Josh Lucas).  Slowly these disparate people assimilate over mutual needs and the presence of Jean and the granddaughter Einar never knew he had mends old wounds and leads to adventures that bring their bizarre circle of life to resolution.Boasting a strong cast and fine script by Mark Spragg and Virginia Korus Spragg, Hallstrom keeps tight reigns on a drama that could have easily splintered into too many sidebars.  He makes us work to understand the motivations of each of his characters, a fact that makes the story more involving.  Redford, Freeman, and Lopez are excellent as are the lesser but fine roles by Gardner, Lucas, Manheim, and Lewis.  Though shot in Canada the feeling of the Wyoming plains is palpable through the fine cinematography of Oliver Stapleton.  This is a quiet film of brooding feelings and buried hurts, but the window for redemption is left ajar to open in the end.

Additionally the impressive presence of the formidable actor Morgan Freeman, who really steals the show with this secondary role is a serious wounded man by the ferocious attack of a bear, who needs daily to be injected with a quotidian doses of morphine sulfate to mask his pain.When J Lo visits his father in law with her daughter, a curious but effective relationship between grandfather and granddaughter will arouse that eventually will transform that irrational rage into best intentions.Thanks to filmmakers as Halstrom, Szabo or Minghella we may testify there is a lot of stories to tell without the febrile necessity to use visual effects to engage the great audiences.The final aerial sequence is a true visual poem.",5,The weight of the blame,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,1709,"['Lasse', 'Halstrom', 'one', 'most', 'talented', 'fine', 'directors', 'world', 'gifted', 'prodigious', 'ability', 'recreate', 'unerring', 'images', 'what', 'often', 'unsaid', 'inspired', 'photography', 'always', 'narrative', 'speech', 'never', 'abuses', 'little', 'frame', 'own', 'specific', 'weight', 'close', 'ups', 'are', 'expressive', 'detail', 'impressive', 'plasticity', 'expressive', 'grimaces', 'complement', 'story.In', 'purest', 'tradition', 'great', 'masters', 'cinema', 'deeply', 'engaged', 'human', 'relationships', 'how', 'redemption', 'not', 'heaven', 's', 'delivery', 'product', 'circumstances.J', 'Lo', 'very', 'alluring', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'leave', 'couple', 'due', 'poor', 'human', 'condition', 'unscrupulous', 'miserable', 'man', 'looser', 'who', 'hit', 'Wyoming', 'order', 'gather', 'father', 'law', 'who', 'still', 'resented', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'was', 'only', 'guilty', 'fatidic', 'car', 'accident', 'Additionally', 'impressive', 'presence', 'formidable', 'actor', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'really', 'show', 'secondary', 'role', 'serious', 'wounded', 'man', 'ferocious', 'attack', 'bear', 'who', 'daily', 'be', 'injected', 'quotidian', 'doses', 'morphine', 'sulfate', 'mask', 'pain.When', 'J', 'Lo', 'father', 'law', 'daughter', 'curious', 'effective', 'relationship', 'grandfather', 'granddaughter', 'will', 'arouse', 'eventually', 'will', 'transform', 'irrational', 'rage', 'best', 'intentions.Thanks', 'filmmakers', 'Halstrom', 'Szabo', 'Minghella', 'may', 'testify', 'lot', 'stories', 'tell', 'febrile', 'necessity', 'use', 'visual', 'effects', 'engage', 'great', 'audiences.The', 'final', 'aerial', 'sequence', 'true', 'visual', 'poem']",N/A

This film definitely belongs in the list of his greats, because it's a great movie. It's one of those movies set in Wyoming and it's nothing we haven't seen before, but the performances are so great and it's so well written...It's hard not to like. Oscar winners Robert Redford (Best Director, 'Ordinary People') and Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, 'Million Dollar Baby') star as Einar Gilkyson and Mitch Bradley, two broken men who lives in the ranchlands of Wyoming. Einar is still reeling from the death of his son 13 years ago and Mitch still suffering from being mauled by a bear less than a year ago. A bear that still finds it's way to their house. Then, their quiet lives take a sudden detour when Jean (Jennifer Lopez) and her daughter Griff show up. Jean was the wife of Einar's son and the woman he blames for his son's death; Running from an abusive boyfriend, Jean and Griff need a place to stay and Einar reluctantly agrees. For a while, Einar continues living his life ignoring that his granddaughter is there...But eventually, inevitably really, they manage to ""warm his heart."" As I said, nothing you haven't seen before. Josh Lucas ('Undertow') also stars as Crane, the local sheriff who Jean takes a liking too; There's also Camryn Manheim ('Happiness') as Nina, the tough waitress at one of the local restaurants. Newcomer Becca Gardner also shows promise as Griff. Redford is perfectly cast as the moody Einar and Freeman as his scarred, but loveable friend. While, at first, it would seem like Jennifer Lopez is out of place in a movie like this...She's actually not bad either. The script is entertaining, has some interesting dialogue, and you really can't help cheering for Redford at the end of the film. It's one of Halstrom's triumphs.GRADE: A-",5,An Unfinished Life,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,1964,"['Lasse', 'Halstrom', 'great', 'director', 'who', 'made', 'great', 'movies', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'etc', 'line', 'always', 'mistake', 'two', 'Casanova', 'film', 'definitely', 'list', 'greats', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'movies', 'set', 'Wyoming', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'great', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Best', 'Director', ""'Ordinary"", 'People', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', ""'Million"", 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'star', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', 'Mitch', 'Bradley', 'two', 'broken', 'men', 'who', 'ranchlands', 'Wyoming', 'Einar', 'still', 'reeling', 'death', 'son', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'Mitch', 'still', 'suffering', 'being', 'mauled', 'bear', 'less', 'year', 'ago', 'bear', 'still', 'way', 'house', 'Then', 'quiet', 'lives', 'take', 'sudden', 'detour', 'when', 'Jean', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'daughter', 'Griff', 'show', 'up', 'Jean', 'was', 'wife', 'Einar', 'son', 'woman', 'son', 'death', 'Running', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'Jean', 'Griff', 'need', 'place', 'stay', 'Einar', 'reluctantly', 'while', 'Einar', 'living', 'life', 'ignoring', 'granddaughter', 'there', 'eventually', 'inevitably', 'really', 'manage', 'warm', 'heart', 'said', 'nothing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'Josh', 'Lucas', ""'Undertow"", 'also', 'Crane', 'local', 'sheriff', 'who', 'Jean', 'liking', 'too', 'also', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', ""'Happiness"", 'Nina', 'tough', 'waitress', 'one', 'local', 'restaurants', 'Newcomer', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'also', 'promise', 'Griff', 'Redford', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'moody', 'Einar', 'Freeman', 'scarred', 'loveable', 'friend', 'first', 'would', 'seem', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'place', 'movie', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'script', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'dialogue', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'cheering', 'Redford', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'Halstrom', 'triumphs.GRADE', 'A-']",N/A

The mountain setting is breathtaking and serene, and there is a nice subplot involving Freeman and a grizzly bear that is quite touching.

968310,A2460ZRFVC2YGV,B000E5KQOQ,Kristopher Haines,"[9, 35]","""An Unfinished Life"" is a seriously flawed film. A Lasse Hallstrom film is always either a hit or a miss. On the one hand you have great films like ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""My Life as a Dog."" On the other hand you have the shamefully boring ""The Shipping News"" and the terribly over-rated ""Chocolat"" The first glaring flaw I noticed in a film that would turn out to be replete with them was the irritating, intrusive, and repetitive score. The second was the pathetic script that almost redefines the term ""heavy-handed."" Exhibit A: the use of the bear as a clumsy and obvious example of the need for forgiveness. Exhibit B: the use of equally clumsy dialogue to reinforce the supposed wisdom imparted by devices such as the above.Robert Redford turns in one of his most wooden and clich&eacute;-ridden performances to date. The only thing that would have made his character more of a cowboy stereotype would have been if he used the phrase ""I reckon."" (I wouldn't have put it past the screenwriters). To make matters worse, the screenwriters actually openly acknowledge that they've created a cookie-cutter character by having another character (whom Redford is running out of town at gunpoint) remark that Redford has seen to many Westerns, to which Redford replies: ""that doesn't exactly work in your favor"".The only actor that gives a more lackluster portrayal than Redford is Jennifer Lopez, who would deserve banishment from the entire acting profession, had it not been for one good performance in ""The Cell."" Although I cannot justify her total banishment I would ask that we never again be subjected to her version of a battered woman. I had quite enough of that in the aptly titled ""Enough.""  In the final analysis there are only two reasons to see this film. One is to witness Morgan Freeman doing what he does best, despite the fact that there is little variation here from anything he's done that was even remotely similar. The second is to see the astonishing debut performance of young Becca Gardner who completely outshines her veteran cast mates. It takes an especially skilled actress to convey weathered innocence. Not only does Gardner succeed, she makes it look absolutely effortless.",2,An Unfinished Movie,1126569600,"09 13, 2005",2005,2209,"['Unfinished', 'Life', 'seriously', 'flawed', 'film', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'film', 'always', 'either', 'hit', 'miss', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'great', 'films', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'Life', 'Dog', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'shamefully', 'boring', 'Shipping', 'News', 'terribly', 'over-rated', 'Chocolat', 'first', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'noticed', 'film', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'replete', 'was', 'irritating', 'intrusive', 'repetitive', 'score', 'second', 'was', 'pathetic', 'script', 'almost', 'term', 'heavy-handed', 'use', 'bear', 'clumsy', 'obvious', 'example', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'Exhibit', 'B', 'use', 'equally', 'clumsy', 'dialogue', 'reinforce', 'supposed', 'wisdom', 'imparted', 'devices', 'such', 'above.Robert', 'Redford', 'one', 'most', 'wooden', 'clich', 'eacute', '-ridden', 'performances', 'date', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'character', 'more', 'cowboy', 'stereotype', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'phrase', 'reckon', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'screenwriters', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'screenwriters', 'actually', 'openly', 'acknowledge', ""'ve"", 'created', 'cookie-cutter', 'character', 'having', 'character', 'whom', 'Redford', 'running', 'out', 'town', 'gunpoint', 'remark', 'Redford', 'seen', 'many', 'Westerns', 'Redford', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'work', 'favor', 'only', 'actor', 'more', 'lackluster', 'portrayal', 'Redford', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'who', 'would', 'deserve', 'banishment', 'entire', 'acting', 'profession', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'one', 'good', 'performance', 'Cell', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'total', 'banishment', 'would', 'ask', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'subjected', 'version', 'battered', 'woman', 'had', 'quite', 'enough', 'aptly', 'titled', 'Enough', 'final', 'analysis', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'reasons', 'see', 'film', 'One', 'witness', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'doing', 'what', 'best', 'fact', 'little', 'variation', 'here', 'anything', 'done', 'was', 'even', 'remotely', 'similar', 'second', 'see', 'astonishing', 'debut', 'performance', 'young', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'who', 'completely', 'veteran', 'cast', 'mates', 'especially', 'skilled', 'actress', 'convey', 'weathered', 'innocence', 'Not', 'only', 'Gardner', 'succeed', 'look', 'absolutely', 'effortless']",N/A

Bernabo,"[7, 7]","In a movie in which Robert Redford stars with Jennifer Lopez and Morgan Freeman, it is surprising that his key dynamic is not with either of those two but with Becca Gardner, the young actress who plays his granddaughter.  But having solid performances and some surprises is key to overcoming the predictability of ""An Unfinished Life,"" because we have all seen stories about unhappy families that heal themselves.  However, they keep making these movies because they are compelling stories and seeing some family more unhappy than our own that manages to come together gives hope to us all.Jean Gilkyson (Lopez) has finally had enough of being slapped around by her boyfriend (Damian Lewis), so she packs up the car, grabs her daughter Gruff (Gardner) and gets out of town.  The car is a piece of junk so it breaks down, and before she gets to her last dime Jean gets them on a bus that drop them off in the middle of nowhere, which in this case is Ishawooa, Wyoming.  That is where Gruff's grandfather, Einar Gilkyson (Redford), runs a ranch.  Gruff did not know she had a grandfather, but that is okay because Einar did not know he has a granddaughter.  He has not seen Jean since the funeral of his son, her husband, who was killed in a car accident.  Jean claims she was pregnant at the time, and Einar does not challenge the fact because he looks at the kid and sees how much she looks like her father, from head to toe.Also living on the ranch is Mitch (Freeman), a longtime ranch hand who is now an invalid because the year before he was mauled by a big bear.  We have seen the bear already in this film, and we will see him again and again because he is not just a big bear, but a big symbol (and one of the more obvious ones of recent vintage).  Einar and Mitch are basically biding time, waiting to die, when these two women show up and shake things up.  However, Einar blames Jean for his son's death, mainly because the concept of an accident offends his moral sensibilities, and also because he knows something about being culpable for such a thing.  In town there are two more key characters: Nina (Camryn Manheim) runs the local greasy spoon and hires Jean on as a waitress so that she can earn the money necessary to get out of Einar's hair.  Crane Curtis (Josh Lucas) is the local sheriff, and he takes a shine to Jean.  He also knows about her ex-boyfriend, so we are not surprised when he shows up again.  In fact, we are a bit afraid of the monkey wrench he might throw into the happiness of these characters.Redford's character is at the center of this story, and the script by Mark Spragg & Virginia Korus Spragg gives him an outlet for his thoughts by having him visit the grave of his son, whose tombstone has the words ""an unfinished life"" carved into them, and talking aloud.  This avoids the necessity of voiceovers and allows Einar to bare his soul, which is good because he is an old fashioned cowboy and that means every time Mitch nails him with a pointed remark all he is going to do is clam up and glare.  However, the chats with his son allow him to open up a bit, and when he finally does have something nice to say to Jean, it is a major moment.While Freeman has a nice moment when he comes face to face with that bear again, this film really comes down to Einar and Gruff.  I liked the fact that at a crucial moment in the film it is she who saves him, which is a surprise.  But there is also much to be said for the quiet moments between the two as they bond, because they stand in marked contrast to the moments when Einar turns to violence.  This is not to say that he is a violent man, but that he knows how to use violence (and how to deliver a killer line to emphasize the lesson he is trying to imprint).  I would not say that he is quick to violence, but rather than Einert does not mess around when it is time to resort to it.  This 2005 film is directed by Lasse Hallstr?m, but it is hard to remember it, because whether he is sharing the moment with a big bear or a little girl, this is Robert Redford's film.  It is not special, but it is certainly solid, from start to finish.",4,"In a world where accidents happen, you have to find a purpose to life",1144800000,"04 12, 2006",2006,4127,"['movie', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'surprising', 'key', 'dynamic', 'not', 'two', 'Becca', 'Gardner', 'young', 'actress', 'who', 'granddaughter', 'having', 'solid', 'performances', 'surprises', 'key', 'overcoming', 'predictability', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'have', 'seen', 'stories', 'unhappy', 'families', 'heal', 'However', 'keep', 'making', 'movies', 'are', 'compelling', 'stories', 'seeing', 'family', 'more', 'unhappy', 'own', 'come', 'together', 'hope', 'all.Jean', 'Gilkyson', 'Lopez', 'finally', 'had', 'enough', 'being', 'slapped', 'boyfriend', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'up', 'car', 'grabs', 'daughter', 'Gruff', 'Gardner', 'town', 'car', 'piece', 'junk', 'down', 'last', 'dime', 'Jean', 'bus', 'off', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'case', 'Ishawooa', 'Wyoming', 'where', 'Gruff', 'grandfather', 'Einar', 'Gilkyson', 'Redford', 'ranch', 'Gruff', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'had', 'grandfather', 'okay', 'Einar', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'granddaughter', 'not', 'seen', 'Jean', 'funeral', 'son', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'Jean', 'claims', 'was', 'pregnant', 'time', 'Einar', 'not', 'challenge', 'fact', 'kid', 'how', 'much', 'father', 'head', 'toe.Also', 'living', 'ranch', 'Mitch', 'Freeman', 'longtime', 'ranch', 'hand', 'who', 'now', 'invalid', 'year', 'was', 'mauled', 'big', 'bear', 'have', 'seen', 'bear', 'already', 'film', 'will', 'see', 'again', 'again', 'not', 'just', 'big', 'bear', 'big', 'symbol', 'one', 'more', 'obvious', 'ones', 'recent', 'vintage', 'Einar', 'Mitch', 'are', 'basically', 'biding', 'time', 'waiting', 'die', 'when', 'two', 'women', 'show', 'up', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'However', 'Einar', 'Jean', 'son', 'death', 'mainly', 'concept', 'accident', 'moral', 'sensibilities', 'also', 'something', 'being', 'culpable', 'such', 'thing', 'town', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'key', 'characters', 'Nina', 'Camryn', 'Manheim', 'local', 'greasy', 'spoon', 'hires', 'Jean', 'waitress', 'can', 'earn', 'money', 'necessary', 'get', 'Einar', 'hair', 'Crane', 'Curtis', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'local', 'sheriff', 'shine', 'Jean', 'also', 'ex-boyfriend', 'are', 'not', 'surprised', 'when', 'up', 'again', 'fact', 'are', 'bit', 'afraid', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'might', 'throw', 'happiness', 'characters.Redford', 'character', 'center', 'story', 'script', 'Mark', 'Spragg', 'Virginia', 'Korus', 'Spragg', 'outlet', 'thoughts', 'having', 'visit', 'grave', 'son', 'tombstone', 'words', 'unfinished', 'life', 'carved', 'talking', 'aloud', 'necessity', 'voiceovers', 'Einar', 'bare', 'soul', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'cowboy', 'time', 'Mitch', 'pointed', 'remark', 'going', 'do', 'clam', 'up', 'glare', 'However', 'chats', 'son', 'allow', 'open', 'up', 'bit', 'when', 'finally', 'have', 'something', 'nice', 'say', 'Jean', 'major', 'moment.While', 'Freeman', 'nice', 'moment', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'bear', 'again', 'film', 'really', 'down', 'Einar', 'Gruff', 'liked', 'fact', 'crucial', 'moment', 'film', 'who', 'surprise', 'also', 'much', 'be', 'said', 'quiet', 'moments', 'two', 'bond', 'stand', 'marked', 'contrast', 'moments', 'when', 'Einar', 'violence', 'not', 'say', 'violent', 'man', 'how', 'use', 'violence', 'how', 'deliver', 'killer', 'line', 'emphasize', 'lesson', 'trying', 'imprint', 'would', 'not', 'say', 'quick', 'violence', 'rather', 'Einert', 'not', 'mess', 'when', 'time', 'resort', '2005', 'film', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstr', 'm', 'hard', 'remember', 'sharing', 'moment', 'big', 'bear', 'little', 'girl', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'film', 'not', 'special', 'certainly', 'solid', 'start', 'finish']",N/A

He guides this film with a sure and steady hand that is as unhurried as it is precise.  Oliver Stapleton's stunning cinematography captures the beauty of the West.  The pivotal character is Robert Redford's Einar Gilkyson whose son died in an auto accident before the film begins.  Redford's only Best Actor nomination came in 1973 for ""The Sting,"" but he delivers a seethingly controlled powerful performance as a man haunted by his past yet struggling to make good moral choices.  His foil is hired ranch hand Mitch who was mauled by a bear.  From his Oscar nominations for ""Street Smart,"" ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to his win in 2004 as Best Supporting Actor in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Morgan Freeman has proved one of our best actors.  He has a knack for communicating great depth of character each time he is on screen.  Excellent makeup made it a little uncomfortable for me to watch Redford put salve on Freeman's back wounds, but it showed the extent of the injury.  Einar faces his past and the loss of his son while Mitch faces his fears about the great bear that mauled him.  Since she was driving the car that killed her husband and Einar's son, Jean played by Jennifer Lopez moved away, had a baby, and has gone from man to man and bad to worse in relationships.  Damian Lewis from ""Dreamcatcher"" and the TV miniseries ""Band of Brothers"" plays the abusive Gary, creepy & manipulative.  Jean seeks refuge with Einar only to be stalked by Gary.  I find Jennifer Lopez to be a very good actress.  She riveted me to the screen in ""Angel Eyes"" and deeply impressed me in ""Enough.""  Her range may not be broad, but she gives a sense of honesty and sincerity in each performance that has an edgy depth.  In this setting with Redford & Freeman, she shines.  Josh Lucas plays the sheriff Crane that becomes involved romantically with Jean.  He does a good job in this supporting role.  As the waitress Nina in the restaurant who gives Jean a job and a crashpad when needed, Camryn Manheim does an excellent job with her limited screen time.  Becca Gardner in her first movie as Griff, named after her deceased father, gives a really engaging an edgy performance.  I particularly appreciated the child's independence and seeing her relationship with Mitch bloom from fear to caring.  While ""An Unfinished Life"" is not the most fast-paced film you'll see, the relationships and working through the conflicts of the past to come to a new present make this an valuable viewing.

Becca Gardner plays the granddaughter who's life so far as made her tough, yet we can see that she had a good upbringing. It was nice to see a believable little girl who was well--mannered.There is a sub-plot that has to do with Freeman's characters connection to the bear that mauled him. Which for some reason makes him feel responsible for the creature. His character is always on the sidelines, but is the glue that helps us invests in all the other characters.

I like the rural dynamics at work here - the stereotype of the independant, ""needing nobody"" farmer shattered (and defined) by his relationship with such characters as the law-bending Sheriff and the diner owner (Manheim). He needs this tiny hamlet as much as they need him.Of course, this theme of interdependance carries through with Mitch's concern for the grizzly bear that mauled him, and  the arrival of Einar's daughter-in-law and Griff, her daughter by Einar's dead son. Themes of blame and forgiveness are worked out as Einar forges a relationship with the granddaughter he never knew he had.

This beautifully filmed movie, shot in the lush Wyoming countryside (actually Canada), starts slow, than sneaks up on you with more meaning than you could possibly have anticipated.Lopez, at the end of her rope,  tries to escape her perpetually abusive boyfriend by running off to her father-in-law's out of state ranch with her young daughter in tow. However, she is bombarded with painful issues regarding him and the death of his own son caused by her negligence in an auto accident.Old wounds die hard and unresolved guilt and blame takes its toll.Her abusive boyfriend is totally determined to hunt her down and take her back home.This motion picture was released under the radar due to Miramax being bought by Disney. It was shelved for two years, then given a limited release, It's largely undiscovered but it does have something important to say.Morgan Freeman plays a ranch hand who is bedridden due to a bear mauling and has his own demons to fight.There are some very special moments to be found in this beautiful film.It's rare, but it sometimes does happen that love can find a way to out-manuver pride, if people and circumstance will just give it a chance.For ten long years, an ordinary rancher (Redford) tenaciously holds onto the loneliness and heartbreak caused by deep grief and un-forgivensss after the accidental death of his son at the hands of his daughter-in-law, then... something finally gives when he gets to meet his granddaughter (named Griff after his son) that he didn't know existed, and as time goes by, they begin to form a very special and unexpected bond together.The inspiring and evocative musical score by Deborah Laurie is suffused with a gentle and silent suffering along with unclaimed possibility, as well as redemption and hope.This film has a way about it that reaches in and touches something deep inside which I am at a loss to fully describe.Suffice to say its a worthy addition to anyone's collection.",4,Redemption,1306022400,"05 22, 2011",2011,2238,"['Unfinished', 'Life', '2005', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Morgan', 'FreemanRated', 'PG13Tagline', 'life', 'secret', 'own.I', 'movies', 'are', 'willing', 'look', 'soul', 'deal', 'process', 'reconciliation', 'redemption', 'bitter', 'broken', 'people', 'families', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'movie', 'shot', 'lush', 'Wyoming', 'countryside', 'actually', 'Canada', 'slow', 'sneaks', 'up', 'more', 'meaning', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'anticipated.Lopez', 'end', 'rope', 'tries', 'escape', 'perpetually', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'running', 'off', 'father-in-law', 'state', 'ranch', 'young', 'daughter', 'tow', 'However', 'bombarded', 'painful', 'issues', 'regarding', 'death', 'own', 'son', 'caused', 'negligence', 'auto', 'accident.Old', 'die', 'hard', 'unresolved', 'guilt', 'blame', 'toll.Her', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'totally', 'determined', 'hunt', 'down', 'take', 'back', 'home.This', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'released', 'radar', 'due', 'Miramax', 'being', 'bought', 'Disney', 'was', 'shelved', 'two', 'years', 'then', 'given', 'limited', 'release', 'largely', 'undiscovered', 'have', 'something', 'important', 'say.Morgan', 'Freeman', 'ranch', 'hand', 'who', 'bedridden', 'due', 'bear', 'mauling', 'own', 'demons', 'are', 'very', 'special', 'moments', 'be', 'found', 'beautiful', 'film.It', 'rare', 'sometimes', 'happen', 'love', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'out-manuver', 'pride', 'people', 'circumstance', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'chance.For', 'ten', 'long', 'years', 'ordinary', 'rancher', 'Redford', 'tenaciously', 'loneliness', 'heartbreak', 'caused', 'deep', 'grief', 'un-forgivensss', 'accidental', 'death', 'son', 'hands', 'daughter-in-law', 'then', 'something', 'finally', 'when', 'meet', 'granddaughter', 'named', 'Griff', 'son', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'existed', 'time', 'begin', 'form', 'very', 'special', 'unexpected', 'bond', 'together.The', 'inspiring', 'evocative', 'musical', 'score', 'Deborah', 'Laurie', 'suffused', 'gentle', 'silent', 'suffering', 'unclaimed', 'possibility', 'as', 'well', 'redemption', 'hope.This', 'film', 'way', 'touches', 'something', 'deep', 'am', 'loss', 'fully', 'describe.Suffice', 'say', 'worthy', 'addition', 'anyone', 'collection']",N/A

Jean manages to talk him into letting them stay at his run-down ranch house for a few weeks, just until she can save up enough money to move elsewhere. But the situation forces both Einar and Jean, and even Jean's daughter, who never knew her father, to begin to face the reality of Griffin's death and reevaluate their lives. Over the course of those few weeks, all of them embark on a healing journey and learn to recognize the things that really matter.Unfortunately, though the themes of the movie are admirable, the story is predictable. There isn't really anything novel or surprising about the course of events. The characters, too, seem a bit commonplace. With one exception - Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Mitch - none of the personalities really seem to stand out. Mitch is an interesting character, however. Formerly a worker on Einar's ranch, he is now largely incapacitated as the result of injuries sustained in a bear mauling. He lives in his own little cabin on the property, and his outside perspective on the family conflicts Einar and Jean are facing allows him to provide a constant voice of reason throughout the film. Mitch's own side story, involving his relationship with the bear who mauled him, also serves as a metaphorical parallel to Einar and Jean's struggle, and a touching lesson about the importance of forgiveness.The other characters are not particuarly memorable, and I didn't feel much of an emotional connection to any of them over the course of the film, but this is more due to the way they were written and not any shortcomings on the actors' parts. The acting all around is fairly solid. I have not seen any of Jennifer Lopez's other movies, but was not expecting much from her given the consistently negative reviews many of her films have received. I was pleasantly surprised. Her performance here is solid and sincere. It's not award-winning material, but it is convincing. Robert Redford does a decent job, but as another reviewer pointed out, his character is too familiar to stand out much for the viewer. I was a little disappointed to see Damian Lewis (""Band of Brothers"") and Josh Lucas (""Glory Road""), both talented actors, given such insignificant parts here. Lewis plays the boyfriend Jean leaves at the beginning of the film, making only a brief reappearance later on, while Lucas takes the role of sheriff in the small town outside of which Einar's ranch is located. Neither has an opportunity to make much of an impression.The DVD has a few extras which are worthwhile. In particular, the featurette on the making of the film actually helped me to better appreciate the messages the filmmakers were trying to get across, and I enjoyed hearing the various actors' viewpoints on the importance of the story. I also very much enjoyed watching the segment entitled ""Training Bart the Bear,"" which details the role of the film's major animal actor, portraying the bear who mauled Mitch. There is some amazing footage of Bart's trainer interacting with the bear. In addition, the DVD offers director, producer, and editor commentary, and a photo gallery. Overall, I'd recommend the film as a rental - it's a worthwhile story with solid acting - but it didn't quite resonate with me enough to warrant a purchase.",3,"3.5 - Not particularly memorable, but not a bad film either.",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,3681,"['When', 'finally', 'courage', 'leave', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'mostly', 'daughter', 'sake', 'Jean', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'one', 'turn', 'except', 'father', 'late', 'husband', 'Einar', 'Gylkison', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'however', 'never', 'forgiven', 'Jean', 'son', 'Griffin', 'death', 'more', 'eleven', 'years', 'earlier', 'nothing', 'do', 'daughter-in-law', 'granddaughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', 'Jean', 'manages', 'talk', 'letting', 'stay', 'run-down', 'ranch', 'house', 'few', 'weeks', 'just', 'can', 'save', 'up', 'enough', 'money', 'move', 'elsewhere', 'situation', 'Einar', 'Jean', 'even', 'Jean', 'daughter', 'who', 'never', 'knew', 'father', 'begin', 'face', 'reality', 'Griffin', 'death', 'reevaluate', 'lives', 'course', 'few', 'weeks', 'embark', 'healing', 'journey', 'learn', 'recognize', 'things', 'really', 'matter.Unfortunately', 'themes', 'movie', 'are', 'admirable', 'story', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'really', 'anything', 'novel', 'surprising', 'course', 'events', 'characters', 'too', 'seem', 'bit', 'commonplace', 'one', 'exception', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'portrayal', 'Mitch', 'none', 'personalities', 'really', 'seem', 'stand', 'out', 'Mitch', 'interesting', 'character', 'however', 'Formerly', 'worker', 'Einar', 'ranch', 'now', 'largely', 'incapacitated', 'result', 'injuries', 'sustained', 'bear', 'mauling', 'own', 'little', 'cabin', 'property', 'outside', 'perspective', 'family', 'Einar', 'Jean', 'are', 'facing', 'allows', 'provide', 'constant', 'voice', 'reason', 'film', 'Mitch', 'own', 'side', 'story', 'involving', 'relationship', 'bear', 'who', 'mauled', 'also', 'metaphorical', 'parallel', 'Einar', 'Jean', 'struggle', 'touching', 'lesson', 'importance', 'forgiveness.The', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'particuarly', 'memorable', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'emotional', 'connection', 'course', 'film', 'more', 'due', 'way', 'were', 'written', 'not', 'shortcomings', 'actors', 'parts', 'acting', 'around', 'fairly', 'solid', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'other', 'movies', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'given', 'consistently', 'negative', 'reviews', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'received', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'performance', 'here', 'solid', 'sincere', 'not', 'award-winning', 'material', 'convincing', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'decent', 'job', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'character', 'too', 'familiar', 'stand', 'out', 'much', 'viewer', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Glory', 'Road', 'talented', 'actors', 'given', 'such', 'insignificant', 'parts', 'here', 'Lewis', 'boyfriend', 'Jean', 'beginning', 'film', 'making', 'only', 'brief', 'reappearance', 'later', 'Lucas', 'role', 'sheriff', 'small', 'town', 'Einar', 'ranch', 'located', 'opportunity', 'make', 'much', 'impression.The', 'DVD', 'few', 'extras', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'particular', 'featurette', 'making', 'film', 'actually', 'helped', 'better', 'appreciate', 'messages', 'filmmakers', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'enjoyed', 'hearing', 'various', 'actors', 'viewpoints', 'importance', 'story', 'also', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'segment', 'entitled', 'Training', 'Bart', 'Bear', 'details', 'role', 'film', 'major', 'animal', 'actor', 'portraying', 'bear', 'who', 'mauled', 'Mitch', 'amazing', 'footage', 'Bart', 'trainer', 'interacting', 'bear', 'addition', 'DVD', 'offers', 'director', 'producer', 'editor', 'commentary', 'photo', 'gallery', 'Overall', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'film', 'rental', 'worthwhile', 'story', 'solid', 'acting', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'resonate', 'enough', 'warrant', 'purchase']",N/A

I am not a big fan of Jennifer Lopez, and her role could have been played by almost anyone.  But with Hallestrom's direction, Lopez was palatable.  Josh Lucas was a good supporting factor.  A very nice surprise was the young girl who plays Lopez's daughter and Redford's granddaughter, Becca Gardner (I believe is her name).  She was charming.  In the bonus interview, one can really see Hallestrom's great direction, for Becca comments as a very young girl, but in the movie, he brings out a mature performance from her.

Tragedy strikes and Gill [Jennifer Lopez] is left alone and pregnant, and disowned by her father-in-law, Einar Gilkyson [Robert Redford]. Life for Gill has since been spent living with abusive husbands until one day she finds the courage to leave the latest, Gary Wilson [Damian Lewis] and return to Wyoming and Einar's ranch. Einer has since been looking after his life-long friend Mitch [Morgan Freeman], who was mauled by a bear and is now left crippled for life. Here begins the troubled story of three characters, each attempting to deal with their troubled pasts. Can Einar forgive his daughter-in-law for an accident that occured so long ago, accept that life is not always fair and, most importantly, accept Gill and his new-found grandaughter into his life? Can Gill face her own demons and become a responsible mother? And, after years of healing, will Mitch once more confront and forgive the animal who crippled him? ~Based on the terrific novel by Mark Spragg and set in the backdrop of rural Wyoming, director Lasse Hallstrom [What's Eating Gilbert Grape; Chocolat] has hit the mark once again with this tense and heartbreaking drama.

Mitch (Morgan Freeman) who, was recently mauled by a bear is the only companion he has left in life. There's is a plantonic, but truly beautiful love story.

He seems more like a symbol for the other characters. The rage, being trapped in a cage, needing freedom, the works. He's a beautiful animal, and one really feels sorry for this bear, yet fears what he's capable of.Will Jean be able to make peace with Einar? Can she make a fresh start in this little town? Will Einar let his grief destroy him? Can he forgive himself, Jean, and the for past misdeeds? It seems that Jean's daughter and Mitch are the only ones free from the cycle of self-hatred and guilt.The main drawback of the money that it's predictible.

Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford shine, bringing their immense talent to the screen, making the story come alive. J.Lo does justice to her character, and manages to hold her own.

I missed the generational barge that finds Robert Redford the bees' knees, and I'm not a huge fan of JLo The Actress.  Morgan Freeman, however, is a class act so I pursued.  The story is that Jean (JLo), through life circumstances, is forced to return to the home of her deceased husband's father until she can get back on her feet.  With daughter in tow she attempts to mend their decade-plus poor relationship. The film accomplishes addressing some very modern sentiments in what one would consider an otherwise remote and ubertraditional setting.  For instance, it is up to the viewer to guess what the relationship is between Redford and Freeman's characters, though the young daughter flat out asks them if they are gay.  The inquiry rolls off the shoulders of these hardboiled cowboys, very openly hinting at the Brokeback cultural phenomenon (released the same year).  Although the film tackles very deep topics in domestic violence, mortality, grief, and despair, it never mires the viewer in the emotional states of the characters.  Given that, this film accomplishes addressing very difficult life experiences without emotionally manipulating its audience.  This is one film that allows the hardships of life to present themselves realistically, no melodrama in sight.  It is this testament to all of the cast that made me a fan of Redford and JLo.  The chemistry between every cast member is real and conveys wholly in the film.  The plot is quite dense though it's never slow or dull, moving along rather well in spite of its many arcs.

The story line is somewhat reminiscent of ""nuthin"" - another book from long ago written by another Wyoming writer, Hary Webb, but there are enough differences to set it apart in it's own right. Splendid scenery, and enough believable ranch settings for it's time and place, even if the sheriff seems a trifle wishy washy, even for out here (except when it comes to whipping his patrol car rapidly off the road into a gravel pit - you'll see why)It's cast is strong; Robert Redford, even under a cruddy crust of week-old beard, is still handsome - aging ruggedly and unashamedly; and is, as usual, a powerful screen presence. Aided by an equally powerful actor, Morgan Freeman, who has never been handsome, doesn't particularly care and proves it again -  this film was wonderful entertainment for me; their respective, opposite character flaws a real joy to behold!Inar's (Redford) daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)returns to the ranch in desperation, fleeing from an abusive ""relationship"" because, in a sensible moment - which seem to be for the most part elusive to her, she knows she must change her lifestyle for the sake of her child at last; broke and on the run, she has nowhere else to turn.  She is reluctant and apprehensive because she knows she will not be welcome - after having been the driver in the auto accident that killed Redford's son, Griff.  His grief has derailed every aspect of his own life; he dwells moment by moment on it; he can't go past it.  Redford is unaware that he even has a grandchild, because the rift was so great after the death that nothing had ever been disclosed to him regarding it.  The little girl is, of course, in the muddied middle and unsure of any move she makes; she wants nothing more at her age than a steady, reliable home and family - free of the turmoil she is experiencing through her mother's on again, off again boyfriend merry-go-round.I'm giving it five stars, which is only slightly more than it merits, simply because a movie of it's kind is hard to come by anymore.  Even it's sexual innuendo is muted enough so that if you are viewing it with your kids, you won't be taken by surprise; and kids, young girls especially of the age group (11-12) represented by the child actress will love it.The grizzly bear scenes are somewhat cheesy if you are at all familiar with bear habits and activity; but that's to be overlooked due to the message it is meant to send; and that is to forgive unmeasurable personal hurt and tragedy and move on before it defeats you entirely.BTW, I recommend the little book ""nuthin"" (1950's) by Harry Webb of Cody, Wyoming -  if you are into this type of entertainment.  It's out of print now, but there are used copies that may located, which is how I found mine again in a nostalgic moment.",5,"""Where Lives Can Change Direction""",1269734400,"03 28, 2010",2010,3057,"['Written', 'Mark', 'Spragg', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'Where', 'Rivers', 'Change', 'Direction', 'inspired', 'heading', 'review', 'beautiful', 'film', 'also', 'distinction', 'having', 'been', 'directed', 'produced', 'members', 'Ladd', 'family', 'who', 'are', 'carrying', 'family', 'tradition', 'story', 'line', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'nuthin', 'book', 'long', 'ago', 'written', 'Wyoming', 'writer', 'Hary', 'Webb', 'are', 'enough', 'differences', 'set', 'apart', 'own', 'right', 'Splendid', 'scenery', 'enough', 'believable', 'ranch', 'settings', 'time', 'place', 'even', 'sheriff', 'trifle', 'wishy', 'washy', 'even', 'out', 'here', 'when', 'whipping', 'patrol', 'car', 'rapidly', 'road', 'gravel', 'pit', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'cast', 'strong', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'even', 'cruddy', 'crust', 'week-old', 'beard', 'still', 'handsome', 'aging', 'ruggedly', 'unashamedly', 'usual', 'powerful', 'screen', 'presence', 'Aided', 'equally', 'powerful', 'actor', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'who', 'never', 'been', 'handsome', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'care', 'again', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful', 'entertainment', 'respective', 'opposite', 'character', 'real', 'joy', 'behold', 'Inar', 'Redford', 'daughter-in-law', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'ranch', 'desperation', 'fleeing', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'sensible', 'moment', 'seem', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'elusive', 'must', 'change', 'lifestyle', 'sake', 'child', 'last', 'broke', 'run', 'nowhere', 'else', 'turn', 'reluctant', 'apprehensive', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'welcome', 'having', 'been', 'driver', 'auto', 'accident', 'killed', 'Redford', 'son', 'Griff', 'grief', 'derailed', 'aspect', 'own', 'life', 'moment', 'moment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'Redford', 'unaware', 'even', 'grandchild', 'rift', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'death', 'nothing', 'had', 'ever', 'been', 'disclosed', 'regarding', 'little', 'girl', 'course', 'muddied', 'middle', 'unsure', 'move', 'nothing', 'more', 'age', 'steady', 'reliable', 'home', 'family', 'free', 'turmoil', 'experiencing', 'mother', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'boyfriend', 'merry-go-round.I', ""'m"", 'giving', 'five', 'stars', 'only', 'slightly', 'more', 'simply', 'movie', 'kind', 'hard', 'come', 'anymore', 'Even', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'muted', 'enough', 'so', 'are', 'viewing', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'surprise', 'kids', 'young', 'girls', 'especially', 'age', 'group', '11-12', 'represented', 'child', 'actress', 'will', 'love', 'it.The', 'grizzly', 'scenes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'cheesy', 'are', 'familiar', 'bear', 'habits', 'activity', 'be', 'overlooked', 'due', 'message', 'meant', 'send', 'forgive', 'unmeasurable', 'personal', 'hurt', 'tragedy', 'move', 'entirely.BTW', 'recommend', 'little', 'book', 'nuthin', '1950', 'Harry', 'Webb', 'Cody', 'Wyoming', 'are', 'type', 'entertainment', 'print', 'now', 'are', 'used', 'copies', 'may', 'located', 'how', 'found', 'mine', 'again', 'nostalgic', 'moment']",N/A

968382,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000E5KQOQ,Wayne C. Rogers,"[5, 5]","I think An Unfinished Life is one of the few movies that both Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman have made that came on in the theaters one weekend and then disappeared two weeks later.  Though a predictable movie, An Unfinished Life is still a very good film with excellent performances by Redford, Freeman, Jennifer Lopez, Josh Lucas, and Becca Gardiner.The story starts out with Lopez and her teenage daughter, Gardiner, leaving an abusive relationship with hardly any money and a broken-down car.  When the car finally reaches its last leg, Lopez has no choice but to head to Wyoming and a father-in-law (played by Redford) who blames her for the death of his only son.  When Lopez reaches Redford's ranch, it turns out the neither he, nor her daughter, knew of each other.  The fact that he's suddenly a grandfather, however, doesn't stop Redford from telling his daughter-in-law that he doesn't want her there and to leave.  Of course, there wouldn't be much of a story if that happened.  Later, when Redford sees Lopez and Gardiner in town, he has a change of heart and tells them that they're welcome to stay at his place if they want.  The two females move in with Redford and his long-time ranch hand and close friend (played by Freeman).  Freeman's character was mauled by a grizzly bear and is now somewhat of a cripple.  He stays in the small house adjacent to the main quarters.  As it turns out, Freeman is also Redford's conscious.  He doesn't hesitate to tell Redford that he's wrong about blaming Lopez for his son's death in a car accident and that he needs to get to know his granddaughter.  Through trials and tribulations, Redford and the two females slowly start to become close to each other.  As this is happening, Lopez develops a relationship with the town's sheriff (played by Josh Lucas).  At first Redford feels that Lopez is being unfaithful to the memory of his son, but gradually relents due to the good nature of the sheriff.  Then, during the last third of the movie, Lopez' abusive boyfriend tracks her down and is intent on having her leave with him.  That's when all hell breaks lose and we find out just how tough Redford's character really is.What makes An Unfinished Life truly shine is the interaction between Redford's character and Freeman's.  These two men have a strong friendship that knows no bounds.  This is displayed most effectively in how Redford takes care of his crippled friend by helping him to get around, making his meals, playing cards with him, and eventually following his advice about everything.  I don't think Redford and Freeman have ever been better than they are in this film.  I have to say, however, that Redford really looks his age.  Though this movie won't win any awards, it's still a pure pleasure to watch.  It's also nice having Jennifer Lopez back after a long absence.  She handles her character perfectly as someone who's filled with guilt and tortures herself for it day in and day out.  The theme of this film is certainly one about our need for forgiveness and to feel whole again.  That's an important message for everyone.  The extras on the DVD have a director's commentary and a making-of featurette and a look at the training of Bart the Bear, who plays a large role in the movie.",4,"A lovely story about blame, guilt and forgiveness!!!",1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,3267,"['think', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'Robert', 'Redford', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'have', 'made', 'came', 'theaters', 'one', 'weekend', 'then', 'disappeared', 'two', 'weeks', 'later', 'predictable', 'movie', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Redford', 'Freeman', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Becca', 'Gardiner.The', 'story', 'out', 'Lopez', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Gardiner', 'leaving', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'hardly', 'money', 'broken-down', 'car', 'When', 'car', 'finally', 'last', 'leg', 'Lopez', 'choice', 'head', 'Wyoming', 'father-in-law', 'played', 'Redford', 'who', 'death', 'only', 'son', 'When', 'Lopez', 'Redford', 'ranch', 'out', 'neither', 'daughter', 'knew', 'other', 'fact', 'suddenly', 'grandfather', 'however', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Redford', 'telling', 'daughter-in-law', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'course', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'story', 'happened', 'Later', 'when', 'Redford', 'Lopez', 'Gardiner', 'town', 'change', 'heart', 'tells', ""'re"", 'welcome', 'stay', 'place', 'want', 'two', 'females', 'move', 'Redford', 'long-time', 'ranch', 'hand', 'close', 'friend', 'played', 'Freeman', 'Freeman', 'character', 'was', 'mauled', 'grizzly', 'bear', 'now', 'somewhat', 'cripple', 'small', 'house', 'adjacent', 'main', 'quarters', 'out', 'Freeman', 'also', 'Redford', 'conscious', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'tell', 'Redford', 'wrong', 'blaming', 'Lopez', 'son', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'get', 'know', 'granddaughter', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'Redford', 'two', 'females', 'slowly', 'start', 'become', 'close', 'other', 'happening', 'Lopez', 'relationship', 'town', 'sheriff', 'played', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'first', 'Redford', 'Lopez', 'being', 'unfaithful', 'memory', 'son', 'gradually', 'relents', 'due', 'good', 'nature', 'sheriff', 'Then', 'last', 'third', 'movie', 'Lopez', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'down', 'intent', 'having', 'leave', 'when', 'hell', 'breaks', 'lose', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'tough', 'Redford', 'character', 'really', 'is.What', 'Unfinished', 'Life', 'truly', 'shine', 'interaction', 'Redford', 'character', 'Freeman', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'strong', 'friendship', 'bounds', 'displayed', 'most', 'effectively', 'how', 'Redford', 'care', 'crippled', 'friend', 'helping', 'get', 'around', 'making', 'meals', 'playing', 'cards', 'eventually', 'following', 'advice', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Redford', 'Freeman', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'however', 'Redford', 'really', 'age', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'still', 'pure', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'also', 'nice', 'having', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'back', 'long', 'absence', 'character', 'perfectly', 'someone', 'who', 'filled', 'guilt', 'day', 'day', 'out', 'theme', 'film', 'certainly', 'one', 'need', 'forgiveness', 'feel', 'whole', 'again', 'important', 'message', 'everyone', 'extras', 'DVD', 'have', 'director', 'commentary', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'look', 'training', 'Bart', 'Bear', 'who', 'large', 'role', 'movie']",N/A
