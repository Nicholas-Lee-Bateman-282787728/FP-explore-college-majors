1696709,A33NKF3Y0CRGCQ,B00JK7QTZE,Amari Sali,"[3, 5]","As I said when it came to Enough Said, there is really this strange lack of middle aged, or beyond, romance films. At least when it comes to stuff which comes across my recommendations anyway. So it makes finding a film like this so beautiful for while there isn&#8217;t the usual over the top romantic gestures, it does somehow make you fall in love with the idea of being with someone for years. Though it also holds that reminder that your loved one can be taken from you at any minute and truly the two sides it presents to love makes you want to smile and cry.Characters & StoryFor most of Nikki&#8217;s (Annette Bening) life she has been married to Garrett (Ed Harris). They have a daughter together, Summer (Jess Weixler), would yearly go to Mexico and seemed to have a happy life. But on their last trip together tragedy strikes. Leaving Nikki seemingly with just the company of Roger (Robin Williams), a fellow widow, for 5 years. That is until Tom (Ed Harris) magically appears and with his appearances you are introduced to Nikki&#8217;s 2nd chance with Garrett. Though you aren&#8217;t really sure if Tom truly looks like Garrett, or if Nikki&#8217;s grief is playing tricks on her.PraiseLet me first start by saying that, for once, I enjoyed Robin Williams performance in something. If just because not only is he not the lead, despite top billing, but it seems he toned down his usual manic persona to actual play a human being. That aside, it really is the love story between Bening and Harris which keeps you attentive. For one, they have good chemistry and really present the idea of growing old with someone to be such an ideal thing. Yet, as noted in the intro, watching Bening deal with the death of her husband really just creates this feeling where, even if you&#8217;re not in a relationship, nor around Bening&#8217;s age, you easily can feel what she is going through. Because with the movie starting you off caught up in the idea of growing old with someone, it is such a punch in the gut to imagine that special someone dying before you and you being left with these memories you can never replicate. Never mind finding someone new who could live up to your expectations, or even surpass them.Which makes the transition of Harris from Garrett to Tom so interest for you aren&#8217;t sure if he is real. After all, even after five years, you can tell Nikki isn&#8217;t fully over Garrett&#8217;s death. With him dying she lost her love of swimming, art, and though she has Roger&#8217;s company, romance with him she sort of makes seem like a sad rebound she wants to avoid. So when Harris is reintroduce as Tom, it brings on this idea, at least for me, that maybe she is imagining things. First you wonder if he is real since he barely interacts with anyone, then you question if Nikki is just picturing Garrett&#8217;s face on a man who may not look like him at all, but by the end of the movie you begin to question if this is even reality? For as Nikki starts to unravel, I honestly wondered if maybe we were just witnessing the delusions of a woman lost in her own head.CriticismNot to spoil things fully, but I really wish when it came to Harris, as Tom, that Summer wasn&#8217;t the sole person who seemed to have the opportunity to really react to seeing him. I would have loved to see Roger react to him as well. Plus, I honestly felt like I wanted to see what happened between the two time jumps. The first one is 5 years after Garrett dies and I would have liked to see Nikki&#8217;s struggle in adjusting to living without Garrett more. For while the film does use flashbacks to illustrate their relationship, I think a few extra minutes to show what happened during that 5 year gap could have been nice. Then the 2nd one is post meeting Tom which could have also used a nice montage, even if during the credits.Lastly, a part of me really thought it was odd Nikki didn&#8217;t look into whether Garrett had a missing twin or something. I get she was just happy to find someone who looked like her husband, but you&#8217;d think she would have been curious about finding this exact replica.Overall: Worth SeeingTruly I haven&#8217;t seen a romance film in a long time which dealt with not just a loved one dying, but also a strong focus on trying to move on. And I have to say the chemistry between Bening and Harris really makes me hope they join each other for another romance film. Hell, I may even go for Williams and Bening being love interest since, I must admit, I kind of wanted to see their relationship go somewhere. Overall though, The Face of Love really is an entertaining film which contains all the cuteness of young love, yet the unfortunate reality of when you realize love and romance isn&#8217;t going to last forever, but just the next couple of years or decade.",4,A film in which one woman is given a second chance to physically be with her husband and get the closure she needs.,1403654400,"06 25,

I LOVE that she looks her age - if she's had plastic surgery, you wouldn't know it because she looks exactly her age, which is refreshingly nice to see.  It was nice to see a movie about older characters, this was an enjoyable chick flick, my husband watched too and said he liked it, but he wouldn't have chosen it.

The only reason I watched the entire movie on Amazon?  Plain and Simple:  Ed Harris.The first sign for me that the movie wasn't going to go well?  Benning's telling Harris (as Tom) that her husband left her (giving Tom the impression that she was divorced) vs stating that she was a widow.  Hiccups in the dialogue continue with Benning's talking to Harris-Tom as if he was Harris-Garret (her husband of 30 years) and shared this life history.I found Robin Williams' character. the neighbor with the crush on Benning, underutilized.  I'd say the same for the daughter, Summer, except for the extremely powerful encounter she has with Harris-Tom.Overall, a major disappointment.  My advice for Amazon Prime Members?

1696712,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B00JK7QTZE,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[5, 5]","It is both sad and a little crazy that a movie headlined by Annette Bening, Ed Harris and Robin Williams could fly so completely under the radar as ""The Face of Love.""  Truthfully, I could watch Bening in almost anything and Harris has long since proven to be one of our most reliable character actors.  Their pairing is the primary reason to check out this endeavor by writer/director Arie Posin (with a co-writing credit going to Matthew McDuffie).  I was a fan of Posin's earlier film effort, ""The Chumscrubber,"" with its over-the-top portrait of suburban unrest.  Here, though, he goes for something distinctly more earnest and heartfelt.  The result, despite nice performances, is terribly uneven.  Bening makes the most of her character and she and Harris have chemistry to spare, but the movie never decides exactly what it wants to be.  Is it a heartfelt romance?  Or maybe a portrait of obsessive love?  The screenplay hedges it bets and wants it both ways.  So what might have been searing and memorable character study leaves many of its most important moments off screen.  It is still watchable, to be sure, it just never quite fulfills its promise.Bening plays a widow still lamenting the death of her husband after five years.  Disconnected from life, she is still supposedly a successful house stager and neither time or money is ever an issue.  I love how affluent people are the only ones that ever have the time in movies to grieve.  When she sees a man who looks just like her deceased husband (Harris), she becomes obsessed with tracking him down.  You'd think this might be complicated in Los Angeles, but Bening meets the challenge head-on with little problem.  When the two get together, he quickly becomes enamored of her despite the fact that she falls apart at their first meeting.  As romance kindles, we wait for the inevitable reveal that he shares a physical likeness to her husband.  The movie, while sweet in many ways, has an underlying sense of creepiness.  Is Bening falling in love or falling apart?  It's an interesting question (fraught with emotional consequences), but the screenplay largely skirts any major analysis of the thorny issues.  Instead, we're treated to a lot of ""almost"" reveals (quite ludicrously stacked up near the end, wait to you see how it happens) that leave Bening looking like a psycho and Harris feeling like a stooge.  Waiting for the powerful conclusion?  Anything you might want to see conveniently plays out off screen.Bening is terrific, as to be expected, but her character is undermined by the screenplay.  I wanted to see her wrestle with her demons, get into the core of her being.  This might have been absolutely devastating, cathartic, and mesmerizing if other plot choices had been made.  As is, the result is blander and less surprising than it has any right to be.  I was going to give the movie four stars for the performances alone until the ending.  By the time the movie had skipped what should have been its most powerful sequences and fast forwards a year, I lost patience and felt a little cheated.  Bening and Harris make this worth a look.  For fans of Williams, he doesn't have a whole lot to do here.  ""The Face of Love"" might have been an unforgettable drama.  In the end, it felt more like a Lifetime weepie featuring an A-List cast.  I didn't hate it by any means, I just wanted it to be great (and it had that potential).  KGHarris, 7/14.",3,"Heartfelt Romance Or Obsessive Love?
