And in some cases it did seem to be the movie I was hoping for, but overall I just felt that it missed the mark.  The acting, I felt was spot on.  With the exception of Devon Graye.  He plays Elliot's (Mark Webber) mentally challenged brother.  I'm not saying that Devon Graye is a bad actor, however.  Just in this part, I didn't really believe that he was mentally challenged.  Regardless, the rest of the crew did very well.The story follows Elliot as he's about to marry his pregnant finance, Shelby (Rutina Wesley).  They aren't doing very well financially and Elliot soon realizes he's also out of a job.  This, along with his brother's insurance falling through, and his dad (Tom Bower) getting evicted, puts a strain on their soon to be family.  While driving home, Elliot receives a call that could drastically change his future.  If he completes 13 challenges, he will be rich beyond his dreams.  Without fully understanding the consequences, he excepts the terms and begins the game.Sounds like a great setup for a really intense movie.  And so some degree, it lives up to it.  However, as the movie plays out, it just begins to get sloppy and fall apart.  Too many situations come about that just don't fully mix with the story and it seems that the writers were trying to tie it all together to finish it up.  I really feel they missed out on something that could have been fantastic.Final Verdict:  RENT IT!  It isn't something that you're going to be excited about once you finish, but you'll also have fun watching it.If this review has helped you decide whether or not to check this movie out, please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below.

1695117,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00IZE00MQ,C. Sawin,"[0, 0]","It has been nearly four years since my original viewing of &#34;13: Game of Death,&#34; which is the Thai film &#34;13 Sins&#34; is based on. &#34;13: Game of Death&#34; was a solid little film that slipped slightly under the mainstream radar. The storyline for both films are nearly identical while some of the challenges are altered. For example, the protagonist doesn't have to eat feces this time around. However the changes leave &#34;13 Sins&#34; feeling like a thriller lacking a big enough bite to drift away from its foreign counterpart and have its own identity.Like &#34;Saw,&#34; &#34;13 Sins&#34; has someone performing an unthinkable task to receive some kind of reward. However, &#34;Saw&#34; mostly had individuals fighting for a life they didn't know they were wasting and only offered freedom as a prize. &#34;13 Sins&#34; stalks the financially crippled, offers a generous fortune, and has them running all over the city to complete 13 tasks. The stunts not only get more challenging, but also get darker along the way; sometimes even being morally degrading and even escalating to the most heinous of crimes.The differences between the main characters in &#34;13: Game of Death&#34; and &#34;13 Sins&#34; is intriguing though. Chit performs the tasks because he's desperate and willing to do anything to get out of debt. However, his conscience always gets in the way as the more treacherous tasks seem to get to him. Elliot begins to enjoy being pushed passed his limits. He never had it in him to defend himself, so standing up to a cop in a coffee shop becomes kind of a big deal even if he is hiding a corpse in plain sight.Like Elliot, the film is never able to find the initiative to be a unique dark thriller. The limb amputation sequence is quite graphic and a simple wire used to hang clothes becomes ridiculously deadly, but the twists in the plot are extremely easy to calculate. Ron Perlman's Detective Chilcoat character is a bit too enigmatic for his own good while the final challenge reveals something you can guess very early on. Even the ending manages to be uplifting when it should be something a bit less optimistic.&#34;13 Sins&#34; is probably more worthwhile if you haven't seen &#34;13: Game of Death,&#34; but is definitely a lackluster and lukewarm effort even if you just take what's dumped direct to DVD into consideration. It doesn't feel horrific enough to be horror and lacks the excitement or suspense of a thriller. The film is equivalent to picking up a loaded pistol, sweating profusely while trying to decide on whether to fire it or not, and then having the pistol jam when the trigger is finally pulled.&#34;13 Sins&#34; throws its audience into an obstacle course it's already completed several times before. Redundant and predictable, &#34;13 Sins&#34; fails at igniting much interest within the viewer.The Blu-ray includes a handful of special features including a Making of (8:38), a deleted sequence revolving around an oral sex challenge (5:50), an alternate ending (2:01), and Anatomy of a Meltdown (2:42), which shows the writer David Birke flipping out on Skype over the oral sex sequence being thrown out of the final cut of the film.",2,A thriller relying solely on mimicry,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,3203,"['been', 'nearly', 'four', 'years', 'original', 'viewing', '34', '13', 'Game', 'Death', '34', 'Thai', 'film', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'based', '34', '13', 'Game', 'Death', '34', 'was', 'solid', 'little', 'film', 'slipped', 'slightly', 'mainstream', 'radar', 'storyline', 'films', 'are', 'nearly', 'identical', 'challenges', 'are', 'altered', 'example', 'protagonist', ""n't"", 'have', 'eat', 'feces', 'time', 'around', 'However', 'changes', 'leave', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'feeling', 'thriller', 'lacking', 'big', 'enough', 'bite', 'drift', 'away', 'foreign', 'counterpart', 'have', 'own', 'identity.Like', '34', 'Saw', '34', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'someone', 'performing', 'unthinkable', 'task', 'receive', 'kind', 'reward', 'However', '34', 'Saw', '34', 'mostly', 'had', 'individuals', 'fighting', 'life', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'were', 'wasting', 'only', 'offered', 'freedom', 'prize', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'stalks', 'financially', 'crippled', 'generous', 'fortune', 'running', 'city', 'complete', '13', 'tasks', 'stunts', 'not', 'only', 'get', 'more', 'challenging', 'also', 'get', 'darker', 'way', 'sometimes', 'even', 'being', 'morally', 'degrading', 'even', 'escalating', 'most', 'heinous', 'crimes.The', 'differences', 'main', 'characters', '34', '13', 'Game', 'Death', '34', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'intriguing', 'Chit', 'tasks', 'desperate', 'willing', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'debt', 'However', 'conscience', 'always', 'way', 'more', 'treacherous', 'tasks', 'seem', 'get', 'Elliot', 'enjoy', 'being', 'pushed', 'passed', 'limits', 'never', 'had', 'defend', 'so', 'standing', 'up', 'cop', 'coffee', 'shop', 'kind', 'big', 'deal', 'even', 'hiding', 'corpse', 'plain', 'sight.Like', 'Elliot', 'film', 'never', 'able', 'find', 'initiative', 'be', 'unique', 'dark', 'thriller', 'limb', 'amputation', 'sequence', 'quite', 'graphic', 'simple', 'wire', 'used', 'hang', 'clothes', 'ridiculously', 'deadly', 'twists', 'plot', 'are', 'extremely', 'easy', 'calculate', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Detective', 'Chilcoat', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'enigmatic', 'own', 'good', 'final', 'challenge', 'reveals', 'something', 'can', 'guess', 'very', 'early', 'Even', 'ending', 'manages', 'be', 'uplifting', 'when', 'should', 'be', 'something', 'bit', 'less', 'optimistic.', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'probably', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', '34', '13', 'Game', 'Death', '34', 'definitely', 'lackluster', 'lukewarm', 'effort', 'even', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'dumped', 'direct', 'DVD', 'consideration', ""n't"", 'feel', 'horrific', 'enough', 'be', 'horror', 'excitement', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'film', 'equivalent', 'picking', 'up', 'loaded', 'pistol', 'sweating', 'profusely', 'trying', 'decide', 'fire', 'not', 'then', 'having', 'pistol', 'jam', 'when', 'trigger', 'finally', 'pulled.', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'audience', 'obstacle', 'course', 'already', 'completed', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'Redundant', 'predictable', '34', '13', 'Sins', '34', 'fails', 'igniting', 'much', 'interest', 'viewer.The', 'Blu-ray', 'handful', 'special', 'features', 'including', 'Making', '8:38', 'deleted', 'sequence', 'revolving', 'oral', 'sex', 'challenge', '5:50', 'alternate', 'ending', '2:01', 'Anatomy', 'Meltdown', '2:42', 'writer', 'David', 'Birke', 'flipping', 'out', 'Skype', 'oral', 'sex', 'sequence', 'being', 'thrown', 'final', 'cut', 'film']",13 Sins

Upon receiving a phone call informing him that he's on a hidden camera game show where he must execute 13 tasks to receive a sum total cash prize of $6.2M, Elliot dismissively follows through with his first two instructions: swat the fly that is currently bothering him, then eat the fly. With thousands of dollars suddenly appearing in his bank account, Elliot remains skeptical, though comforted by the knowledge that he can stop playing at any time if only to lose every penny that he's won. Trapped into the horrors manipulated by unseen spectators, Elliot's need to complete the game escalates as the tasks grow more extreme, to a devastating point of no return.Review - 4/5Director Daniel Stamm has redeemed himself after makingThe Last Exorcismin 2010. I walked out of the theatre half way through that movie. This film isn't an original ideal by any means, but it's a blast to watch to see what happens next. Mark Webber plays the unfortunate guy who is put through a series of dares to receive money. It's a little sick, twisted & downright cruel at times. But Webber pulls it off perfectly. We even get to see Ron Perlman. Always nice to see Ron in just about anything. You must give this one a chance. I like it better than any of the Saw films or most horror films that are coming out in theatres.

However, I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed this movie. 13 Sins is more of a low budget  psychological thriller. Elliot (Mark Webber) is the &#34;good guy&#34; central character of the story. IMO, he's presented more &#34;saint-like&#34; than &#34;good-guy&#34; in the beginning. He's fired basically for being too ethical, although he's top salesman for his company. Several loved ones are financially dependent on Elliot. He provides care for his mentally challenged brother, expecting African American fianc&eacute; and racist, overbearing father, all living together with Elliot. Driving, he receives a phone call stating X amt. money will be deposited into his bank acct. if he performs a simple &#34;task&#34; or &#34;challenge,&#34; killing a fly already present and annoying him in the car. He performs, receives the deposit. The second call &#34;invites&#34; him to participate in the 13 challenges. If all completed, he will receive abundant wealth. If he refuses a challenge any amt. awarded is forfeited. Each challenge is more sinister in nature. The story focus is more about changes in Elliot's psyche than the individual challenges, although viewers preferring &#34;gore&#34; most likely won't be disappointed.  It's creepy during certain challenges, esp. when facing 2 school bullies from his past. Surprisingly, 13 Sins goes deeper than expected. Ron Perlman (Beauty & the Beast) is believable as chief investigator. Certain scenes left me wondering if the calls were real vs. mental illness. Perhaps, the performance (also, great) by the actor playing John Cusack's alter ego in &#34;Identity&#34; had undo influence. Regardless, 13 Sins is a combo. of good script, good acting and overall chemistry between characters. Admittedly, many questions are left unanswered. The second half begins to unravel somewhat, but 13 Sins is presented more as a suspenseful  experiment, with supernatural qualities, testing a theory anyone can become a monster given certain situations. It's a story of one man's psyche taken to the extreme. Elliot discovers he's not alone playing the game. Others, are also players, but on different challenges. Personally, I enjoyed 13 Sins. I didn't find it scary, but more suspenseful and creepy in nature.",4,An Enjoyable Creepy Diversion,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",2014,2308,"['expectations', 'were', 'fairly', 'low', 'prior', 'watching', 'However', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'movie', '13', 'Sins', 'more', 'low', 'budget', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Elliot', 'Mark', 'Webber', '34', 'good', 'guy', '34', 'central', 'character', 'story', 'IMO', 'presented', 'more', '34', 'saint-like', '34', '34', 'good-guy', '34', 'beginning', 'fired', 'basically', 'being', 'too', 'ethical', 'top', 'salesman', 'company', 'Several', 'loved', 'ones', 'are', 'financially', 'dependent', 'Elliot', 'care', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'brother', 'expecting', 'African', 'American', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'racist', 'overbearing', 'father', 'living', 'together', 'Elliot', 'Driving', 'phone', 'call', 'stating', 'X', 'amt', 'money', 'will', 'be', 'deposited', 'bank', 'acct', 'simple', '34', 'task', '34', '34', 'challenge', '34', 'killing', 'fly', 'already', 'present', 'annoying', 'car', 'deposit', 'second', 'call', '34', 'invites', '34', 'participate', '13', 'challenges', 'completed', 'will', 'receive', 'abundant', 'wealth', 'challenge', 'amt', 'awarded', 'forfeited', 'challenge', 'more', 'sinister', 'nature', 'story', 'focus', 'more', 'changes', 'Elliot', 'psyche', 'individual', 'challenges', 'viewers', 'preferring', '34', 'gore', '34', 'most', 'likely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'creepy', 'certain', 'challenges', 'esp', 'when', 'facing', '2', 'school', 'bullies', 'past', 'Surprisingly', '13', 'Sins', 'deeper', 'expected', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Beauty', 'Beast', 'believable', 'chief', 'investigator', 'Certain', 'scenes', 'left', 'wondering', 'calls', 'were', 'real', 'vs.', 'mental', 'illness', 'Perhaps', 'performance', 'also', 'great', 'actor', 'playing', 'John', 'Cusack', 'alter', 'ego', '34', 'Identity', '34', 'had', 'undo', 'influence', 'Regardless', '13', 'Sins', 'combo', 'good', 'script', 'good', 'acting', 'overall', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'Admittedly', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'second', 'half', 'unravel', 'somewhat', '13', 'Sins', 'presented', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'experiment', 'supernatural', 'qualities', 'testing', 'theory', 'anyone', 'can', 'become', 'monster', 'given', 'certain', 'situations', 'story', 'one', 'man', 'psyche', 'taken', 'extreme', 'Elliot', 'not', 'alone', 'playing', 'game', 'Others', 'are', 'also', 'players', 'different', 'challenges', 'Personally', 'enjoyed', '13', 'Sins', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'scary', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'creepy', 'nature']",13 Sins
1695127,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00IZE00MQ,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 0]","13 SINS has a lot in common with another film that was recently released called CHEAP THRILLS. Both are entertaining, but CHEAP THRILLS warrants a five star review, while 13 SINS falls short in a few key ways.The similarities between the films are pretty major. Both are about meek men with money problems who find themselves out of a job. Both movies go a little overboard to set up intensely hopeless circumstances, although 13 SINS definitely wins the race in this regard. Our lead, Eliot, is about to get married and have a baby, is financially responsible for the health and well-being of his mentally challenged younger brother, and is forced to accommodate his recently-evicted father (a racist who openly detests Eliot's black bride-to-be). In both movies, the lead meets a rich benefactor who offers money for a series of increasingly bizarre and dangerous actions. The ultimate message of both films is about what it takes to change a person as well as how far someone might be willing to go to provide for both themselves and their loved ones.13 SINS takes a sinister and mythical approach to its film. In CHEAP THRILLS, the lead character (as well as an old chum from school) both meet a rich couple who shell out money for the actions in the guise of bets. The film is a gritty, intense, and deeply personal look at what would drive anyone to do the unthinkable. The movie pulls no punches, doesn't bother answering unimportant background questions, and avoids a complex plot in favor of complex character development.13 SINS, not so much. It creates an ominous mythos to its story by making the rich benefactor a faceless British voice on a phone who tells Eliot that he has been chosen to take part in a game that involves thirteen challenges. The first two -- kill a fly and then eat it -- seem innocuous enough, and they win him several thousand dollars, so he agrees to participate in the remaining eleven challenges under the direction that he is not allowed to tell anyone else about the game nor quit the game without losing all of the money he's gained. The voice seems to belong to some network of intensely powerful people who can seemingly see all and know all. No matter where he is, the voice not only knows what Eliot is doing but can access him via any phone at all with the same obnoxious, circus/calliope ringtone.This, of course, makes our villain a lot more impersonal than the couple from CHEAP THRILLS. I don't count this against the  film since it means all of our focus is on Eliot, who is amazingly acted by the relatively unknown Mark Webber. He does a terrific job of helming the film through his character's chaotic and disturbing decline. Also, the motivations behind the unknown antagonist are given a wide, unearthly scope that isn't found in CHEAP THRILLS, which makes it about cold-hearted entertainment. That may be the case here -- we have a B-plot that follows cop Ron Perlman around as he talks about the game with a cross-eyed conspiracy theorist who gives us some hasty exposition -- but it's never fully addressed. What IS shown is that there is a level of complexity and planning in place that goes way beyond just watching someone do nasty things. The story, especially in the final acts, develops the insights and twists that make these kinds of tales richly satisfying when more solid answers are in short supply.However, unlike CHEAP THRILLS, 13 SINS jumps the rails in the final ten minutes or so in an attempt to create an ending that modern audiences might find a little more palatable. I wouldn't call it a happy ending, but I also wouldn't say it's a sad one, and it's that sort of ambiguity that robs the film of its juice. Instead of putting a period on the message it's spent ninety minutes explaining, the movie backs off and gives the audience a sort of apologetic shrug, rendering meaningless any of the gloom or glory that the final shot is meant to convey. It's like the script was penned by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke; they couldn't agree on whether or not man is essentially good or evil,  so they just went with a big, boring question mark at the end.Combined with a few gaps in logic and a not-altogether-convincing acting job by Eliot's mentally challenged brother (his part in the film felt almost caricatured), this inability to stick the landing makes the film a four star job at best. It's still entertaining and propulsive and worthy of the questions it poses, but if you really want a movie to hammer its point home with unflinching artistry, I recommend CHEAP THRILLS. Viewers who are prone to depression, however, might want to stick with this, slightly more ambiguous, offering.",4,Fight The Power,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,4665,"['13', 'SINS', 'lot', 'common', 'film', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'called', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'are', 'entertaining', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'warrants', 'five', 'star', 'review', '13', 'SINS', 'falls', 'short', 'few', 'key', 'ways.The', 'similarities', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'major', 'are', 'meek', 'men', 'money', 'problems', 'who', 'find', 'job', 'movies', 'go', 'little', 'overboard', 'set', 'up', 'intensely', 'hopeless', 'circumstances', '13', 'SINS', 'definitely', 'race', 'regard', 'lead', 'Eliot', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'baby', 'financially', 'responsible', 'health', 'well-being', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'younger', 'brother', 'forced', 'accommodate', 'recently-evicted', 'father', 'racist', 'who', 'openly', 'Eliot', 'black', 'bride-to-be', 'movies', 'lead', 'rich', 'benefactor', 'who', 'money', 'series', 'increasingly', 'bizarre', 'dangerous', 'actions', 'ultimate', 'message', 'films', 'what', 'change', 'person', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'far', 'someone', 'might', 'be', 'willing', 'go', 'provide', 'loved', 'ones.13', 'SINS', 'sinister', 'mythical', 'approach', 'film', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'lead', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'chum', 'school', 'meet', 'rich', 'couple', 'who', 'shell', 'out', 'money', 'actions', 'guise', 'bets', 'film', 'gritty', 'intense', 'deeply', 'personal', 'look', 'what', 'would', 'drive', 'anyone', 'do', 'unthinkable', 'movie', 'punches', ""n't"", 'bother', 'answering', 'unimportant', 'background', 'questions', 'complex', 'plot', 'favor', 'complex', 'character', 'development.13', 'SINS', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'ominous', 'mythos', 'story', 'making', 'rich', 'benefactor', 'faceless', 'British', 'voice', 'phone', 'who', 'Eliot', 'been', 'chosen', 'take', 'part', 'game', 'thirteen', 'challenges', 'first', 'two', 'kill', 'fly', 'then', 'eat', 'seem', 'innocuous', 'enough', 'win', 'several', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'participate', 'remaining', 'eleven', 'challenges', 'direction', 'not', 'allowed', 'tell', 'anyone', 'else', 'game', 'quit', 'game', 'losing', 'money', 'gained', 'voice', 'belong', 'network', 'intensely', 'powerful', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'seemingly', 'see', 'know', 'matter', 'where', 'voice', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'Eliot', 'doing', 'can', 'access', 'phone', 'same', 'obnoxious', 'circus/calliope', 'ringtone.This', 'course', 'villain', 'lot', 'more', 'impersonal', 'couple', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'do', ""n't"", 'count', 'film', 'focus', 'Eliot', 'who', 'amazingly', 'acted', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Mark', 'Webber', 'terrific', 'job', 'helming', 'film', 'character', 'chaotic', 'disturbing', 'decline', 'Also', 'motivations', 'unknown', 'antagonist', 'are', 'given', 'wide', 'unearthly', 'scope', ""n't"", 'found', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'cold-hearted', 'entertainment', 'may', 'be', 'case', 'here', 'have', 'B-plot', 'cop', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'game', 'cross-eyed', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'who', 'hasty', 'exposition', 'never', 'fully', 'addressed', 'What', 'IS', 'shown', 'level', 'complexity', 'planning', 'place', 'way', 'just', 'watching', 'someone', 'do', 'nasty', 'things', 'story', 'especially', 'final', 'acts', 'insights', 'twists', 'make', 'kinds', 'tales', 'richly', 'satisfying', 'when', 'more', 'solid', 'answers', 'are', 'short', 'supply.However', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', '13', 'SINS', 'rails', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'attempt', 'create', 'ending', 'modern', 'audiences', 'might', 'find', 'little', 'more', 'palatable', 'would', ""n't"", 'call', 'happy', 'ending', 'also', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'sad', 'one', 'sort', 'ambiguity', 'film', 'juice', 'Instead', 'putting', 'period', 'message', 'spent', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'explaining', 'movie', 'audience', 'sort', 'apologetic', 'shrug', 'rendering', 'meaningless', 'gloom', 'glory', 'final', 'shot', 'meant', 'convey', 'script', 'was', 'penned', 'Thomas', 'Hobbes', 'John', 'Locke', 'could', ""n't"", 'agree', 'not', 'man', 'essentially', 'good', 'evil', 'just', 'went', 'big', 'boring', 'question', 'mark', 'end.Combined', 'few', 'gaps', 'logic', 'not-altogether-convincing', 'acting', 'job', 'Eliot', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'brother', 'part', 'film', 'felt', 'almost', 'caricatured', 'inability', 'stick', 'landing', 'film', 'four', 'star', 'job', 'best', 'still', 'entertaining', 'propulsive', 'worthy', 'questions', 'really', 'want', 'movie', 'hammer', 'point', 'home', 'unflinching', 'artistry', 'recommend', 'CHEAP', 'THRILLS', 'Viewers', 'who', 'are', 'prone', 'depression', 'however', 'might', 'want', 'stick', 'slightly', 'more', 'ambiguous', 'offering']",13 Sins
1695128,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00IZE00MQ,Mark Turner,"[0, 0]","It's always nice to see a small film with no buildup get released and then discover that it's better than some of the big name titles coming out. Sure we all want to see the major releases but those small flicks often offer some great storytelling that outweighs blockbuster titles. Such is the case with 13 SINS.Elliot Brindle (Mark Webber) is as far down on his luck as you can be. About to be married and expecting a child the company he works for decides to fire him. Their reason is that he isn't cut throat enough, that he doesn't have the gumption it takes to be a go getter. This means that he won't have insurance so his mentally disabled brother won't be taken care of. At the same time his father is facing eviction from his apartment and will have to move in with him as well. At the end of his rope, Elliot has no hope.Then while sitting at a red light a cell phone begins ringing. He finds the phone sitting on the car seat and a mysterious voice tells him if he is willing to play a game then he can earn $100. All he has to do is swat the fly in his car buzzing around his head. He does so and a text alert tells him he now has $100 in his account. The voice tells him there is a game consisting of 13 obstacles and he's just passed the first one. If he eats the fly, he gets more money and moves on towards the next event. Bon appetite!Elliot thinks things are going well now. He has the chance to get himself out of debt and to move on with his life. He gets another call that lets him know that once the game begins he can't back out. To do so means he forfeits everything he's won so far. He agrees only to find the tasks more and more outrageous, eventually putting his life on the line as well as his freedom when certain felonious events are asked of him. Just how far is Elliot willing to go?The end prize is $6,000,000. On top of that the voice tells him that all traces of his crimes will be erased and he won't end up in prison. But halfway through the 13 events he is told that should he now quit he not only forfeits the money but is on his own when it comes to the police. Arson, moving a dead body and more await Elliot, but only if he carries on, all the while being watched through various means by the mysterious voice.The movie develops with each new request of the voice, forcing Elliot to move on to more and more events that could lead him down a path of no redemption. But each one of these events not only puts more money in his pocket, with the first batch they begin to change Elliot from the milk toast that he begins as to someone to be reckoned with. But as each item gets more and more violent his willingness begins to falter. Will he complete all 13 items?While watching this movie you can't help but ask yourself would I be willing to do what Elliot has done? Would I have even started following these tasks? Or would I simply have allowed the world to come crashing down on me with the hand that life had dealt? It's not an easy answer to come up with. If you've ever felt at wits end you know that there are times you might do anything. But that's the true word that comes into play, anything. Would or could you do anything?The movie is well made and the pacing is great with each new item laid out and the consequences of each there to witness. As Elliot goes from willing contestant to possible patsy you wonder if he will actually succeed at these tasks. And if he does, will those responsible for the game actually follow through? In the end the movie holds your interest from start to finish.There are some gruesome and gory moments here but most are fairly light compared to things seen on TV these days (with one possible exception involving and amputation). As the world becomes a crazier place these days with people seeming to do things thought unheard of at one time, you begin to wonder if perhaps the game is actually being played today. Keeping that thought in mind, if someone calls your cell phone and asks you to swat a fly?

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[2, 2]","13 SINS is a bit reminiscent of THE GAME (1997) with Michael Douglas, except that the games in this 2014 film are considerably more brutal, and star Mark Webber is, up to a point, a willing participant.Elliot (Webber) is a meek, likable young man who is in major financial trouble.  He has a mentally disabled brother (Devon Graye) and an elderly father (Tom Bower) that he must care for, and his fianc&eacute;e (Rutina Wesley) is pregnant.  If all that isn&#8217;t concern enough, he&#8217;s also deeply in debt and he has just lost his job as an insurance salesman.Driving along one night, Elliot receives a strange phone call, informing him that he is a contestant on a game show, and that if he performs thirteen tasks, he will become an instant multi-millionaire.  After each challenge is completed, cash appears in his bank account, but if he refuses any task, all that sudden money will disappear.The first task is relatively simple.  He must swat a fly&#8230;for $1000.00.  Now, if he eats the fly, he gets an additional $3600.00.Elliott eats the fly, but then the challenges accelerate, becoming more bold, dangerous, violent and extremely gruesome.  Indeed, soon the police (Ron Perlman) are looking for Elliott on a variety of charges.Not wanting to be a Spoiler, I&#8217;m not going to tell you any more of the plot, except that the third act of this tense, entertaining drama is filled with some surprising twists.Pruitt Taylor Vince co-stars in the thriller, directed by Daniel Stamm, who co-wrote the script with David Birke.The Blu-Ray from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by Stamm and several cast members, an alternate ending, a &#8220;Making of&#8221; featurette and more.

1695131,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00IZE00MQ,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 0]","This film was an excellent surprise! After watching the trailer, and the description of the film, it didn't sound like it was going to be much, but I'm glad I took a chance on it now, as it proved itself a very interesting little horror film that could definitely spawn a series of sequels.The film evolves around Elliot played by Mark Webber. He is about to get married, and is also providing the finance to keep his autistic brother out of mental hospitals. He lives with his father who is an old bitter racist and is just as broke as the rest of them. Struggling to get by on what he makes, he receives a phone call out of the blue from a mysterious English man who asks him if wants to be a contestant on a game show. However, this is not your typical game show. This man can somehow see Elliot's every move. The first challenge he is given is to kill a fly that is bugging Elliot inside of his car while he is stopped at a red light. Upon killing the fly Elliot receives a text message informing him he has just won $1000. The caller returns and says challenge 2 is to eat the fly for something like $5000? To which Elliot does, and receives a text he has just received $5000 to his bank account. Now the caller rings once more and offers him the chance to keep playing or leave now? After saying something silly and pressing 1 to confirm he is in, that's when the challenges become much harder and gruesome. Elliot figures he really needs the money for his wedding, wife carrying with child, and his brother. However one of the rules is, once you sign on, you can not leave, otherwise you loose everything.Although it sounds a bit like the Saw movies in ways, you can clearly tell Saw is an inspiration to it, but it's definitely not a Saw type of movie. I found it more something like a horror version of Rat Race. Not so much the race, but what John Cleese and his rich friends where doing in that movie by being so bored they are daring people to do things and betting on it. It also makes you think, just how far would you go to receive a large amount of cash? And you can guess from the title that the sins asked to preform are going to go through all the deadly sins, and it does not disappoint.There is some cool moments, decent gory bits, and an almost perfect ending. The ending is fine, it's what they continued onto it that I thought probably should have been cut off, but apart from that, it's an enjoyable movie, with a good cast. It has a few laughs here and there, but as for being scary? I dunno, nothing scares me anymore, so I can't say if it will frighten anyone else... I mean I watched Wolf Creek 2 and found it hilarious, but my sister in law turned it off because it was too much for her to handle. So you'll have to see this for yourself to determine if it's somewhat scary? But I do definitely recommend checking this film any way you can if it sounds interesting to you?",4,In the hands of Death,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",2014,2902,"['film', 'was', 'excellent', 'surprise', 'watching', 'trailer', 'description', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'sound', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'much', ""'m"", 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'now', 'proved', 'very', 'interesting', 'little', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'definitely', 'spawn', 'series', 'sequels.The', 'film', 'evolves', 'Elliot', 'played', 'Mark', 'Webber', 'get', 'married', 'also', 'providing', 'finance', 'keep', 'autistic', 'brother', 'mental', 'hospitals', 'father', 'who', 'old', 'bitter', 'racist', 'just', 'as', 'broke', 'rest', 'Struggling', 'get', 'what', 'phone', 'call', 'blue', 'mysterious', 'English', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'contestant', 'game', 'show', 'However', 'not', 'typical', 'game', 'show', 'man', 'can', 'somehow', 'see', 'Elliot', 'move', 'first', 'challenge', 'given', 'kill', 'fly', 'bugging', 'Elliot', 'inside', 'car', 'stopped', 'red', 'light', 'killing', 'fly', 'Elliot', 'text', 'message', 'informing', 'just', 'won', '1000', 'caller', 'returns', 'challenge', '2', 'eat', 'fly', 'something', '5000', 'Elliot', 'text', 'just', 'received', '5000', 'bank', 'account', 'Now', 'caller', 'once', 'more', 'chance', 'keep', 'playing', 'leave', 'now', 'saying', 'something', 'silly', 'pressing', '1', 'confirm', 'when', 'become', 'much', 'harder', 'gruesome', 'Elliot', 'really', 'money', 'wedding', 'wife', 'carrying', 'child', 'brother', 'However', 'one', 'rules', 'once', 'sign', 'can', 'not', 'leave', 'otherwise', 'loose', 'bit', 'Saw', 'movies', 'ways', 'can', 'clearly', 'tell', 'Saw', 'inspiration', 'definitely', 'not', 'Saw', 'type', 'movie', 'found', 'more', 'something', 'horror', 'version', 'Rat', 'Race', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'race', 'what', 'John', 'Cleese', 'rich', 'friends', 'where', 'doing', 'movie', 'being', 'so', 'bored', 'are', 'daring', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'betting', 'also', 'think', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'receive', 'large', 'amount', 'cash', 'can', 'guess', 'title', 'sins', 'asked', 'preform', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'deadly', 'sins', 'not', 'disappoint.There', 'cool', 'moments', 'decent', 'gory', 'bits', 'almost', 'perfect', 'ending', 'ending', 'fine', 'what', 'continued', 'thought', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'off', 'apart', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'good', 'cast', 'few', 'laughs', 'here', 'there', 'being', 'scary', 'dunno', 'nothing', 'scares', 'anymore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'will', 'frighten', 'anyone', 'else', 'mean', 'watched', 'Wolf', 'Creek', '2', 'found', 'hilarious', 'sister', 'law', 'turned', 'off', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'handle', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'determine', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'do', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'checking', 'film', 'way', 'can', 'interesting']",13 Sins
