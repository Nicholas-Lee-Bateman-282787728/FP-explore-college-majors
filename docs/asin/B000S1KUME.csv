Her boyfriend Josh (John Reardon) is burnt to death in his apartment - seemingly an accident caused by the lighted candles he used. In school she was bullied by Joey Pastorelli.

1084822,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000S1KUME,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","Readers of Nora Roberts books will doubtless want to watch this adaptation of one of her popular novels (to date there are four of her books translated into made for television movies).  The story, as adapted by Ronni Kern, is straight forward with enough of a mixture of love scenes and action scenes to please the audience. No, this is not a major league film, but it is made with a fine cast of actors who bring the drama to life.Reena Hale (Alicia Witt) watched as her family's pizzeria burned to the ground after a scuffle between Reena's father Gib (Eric Keenleyside) and neighbor Joe Pastorelli (David Brown).  Pastorelli is convicted of arson and swears to get even.  Jump years later and Reena is now an arson investigator under the tutelage of Officer John Minger (Scott Bakula) who had solved the case in Reena's family's loss.  Once credentialed, Reena finds herself stalked by an arsonist who just happens to include two of Reena's boyfriends as victims of deaths by fire.  The story is a search and destroy mission to discover the identity of the arsonist and Reena is aided by her newest love interest Bo Goodnight (Matthew Settle) in a taut, well paced and well filmed adventure: if the identity of the arsonist is rather apparent early on, that doesn't diminish the suspense  aspect of the film.The supporting cast includes fine actor Talia Shire as Reena's mother, a role that adds a touch of human comedy as well as unconditional love that lifts the story just when it needs grounding, as well as some very fine fresh faces with promise.  David Carson directs the many fire scenes with a good sense of 'reality' and delivers a sound message about the worth of arson investigators and firemen. But in the end it is Alicia Witt's movie and she carries her character well.  Good entertainment.

The biggest one is how long it takes for Reena to figure out who her nemesis is (although this was less obvious in the movie than in the book). One bad thing that the movie adds is that the climax feels more silly than suspenseful (especially because the bad guy actor speaks in a really silly voice, supposedly because he had cancer - anyway it was way too over-the-top).I did like this movie better than ""Angels Fall"", which somehow felt cheaper.

In particular, strong performances from Alicia Witt and Matthew Settle anchor a solid story, one focused as much on the fire investigations Reena pursues as her growing relationship with Bo. Settle has the perfect blend of puppy-dog loyalty and strong, secure masculinity to portray the blue-collar hero who fell in love at first sight, and Witt's intensely focused Reena is well balanced by the soft, sad memories that haunt her. Scott Bakula shines in the role of Reena's mentor, grounding her but letting her take the lead. Talia Shire is the fiery matriarch of Reena's family; unusually for Roberts, here she gives us a heroine embedded in a loving, close family.It's not all that hard to figure out who the villain is, but that's beside the point in a romance. The real focus of this story is on the feisty, never-say-die heroine, a woman finding her way in a traditional man's career, with drive and energy. Roberts has a penchant for these strong women -- Eve Dallas, Phoebe MacNamara, and a host of other overcaffeinated but sensitive heroines populate her books. Reena is another in this mold, a woman whose gradual discovery of real love brought me back to the book, and to this movie, several times.",4,Best of the Nora Roberts adaptations so far,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",2011,1334,"['made-for-TV', 'adaptation', 'Blue', 'Smoke', 'far', 'best', 'translation', 'book', 'movie', 'Nora', 'Roberts', 'collection', 'particular', 'strong', 'performances', 'Alicia', 'Witt', 'Matthew', 'Settle', 'anchor', 'solid', 'story', 'one', 'focused', 'as', 'much', 'fire', 'investigations', 'Reena', 'pursues', 'growing', 'relationship', 'Bo', 'Settle', 'perfect', 'blend', 'puppy-dog', 'loyalty', 'strong', 'secure', 'masculinity', 'portray', 'blue-collar', 'hero', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'first', 'sight', 'Witt', 'intensely', 'focused', 'Reena', 'well', 'balanced', 'soft', 'sad', 'memories', 'haunt', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'shines', 'role', 'Reena', 'mentor', 'grounding', 'letting', 'take', 'lead', 'Talia', 'Shire', 'fiery', 'matriarch', 'Reena', 'family', 'unusually', 'Roberts', 'here', 'heroine', 'embedded', 'loving', 'close', 'family.It', 'not', 'that', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'villain', 'beside', 'point', 'romance', 'real', 'focus', 'story', 'feisty', 'never-say-die', 'heroine', 'woman', 'finding', 'way', 'traditional', 'man', 'career', 'drive', 'energy', 'Roberts', 'penchant', 'strong', 'women', 'Eve', 'Dallas', 'Phoebe', 'MacNamara', 'host', 'other', 'overcaffeinated', 'sensitive', 'heroines', 'populate', 'books', 'Reena', 'mold', 'woman', 'gradual', 'discovery', 'real', 'love', 'brought', 'back', 'book', 'movie', 'several', 'times']",Blue Smoke
