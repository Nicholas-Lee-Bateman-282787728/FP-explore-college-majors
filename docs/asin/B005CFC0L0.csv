I think Thanksgiving had already passed so it was a long time before I watched it. However, I've watched it twice this year so obviously I like it. I was surprised to see Faye Dunaway again and she was probably the main reason I ordered it. I had not seen her in anything lately and she is important to the plot of the movie but we don't see a lot of her. This is not an unusual storyline. So many of the movies have someone who lost a loved one around this time of the year or they are so busy with their career that they don't think about any of the holidays. This movie falls into the category of work, only it's one of two that have the plot with a woman and no ghost that got them there. I think the part I liked best was how the super busy lawyer was constantly putting down her sister who is a stay-at-home Mom. The lawyer thinks her job is her life and she believes her sister does nothing and has lots of time. It's nice to see working at home Mom's vindicated as the super sister learns there is more to life than her job and her sister is extremely busy and being a Mom is just as important as her life as a lawyer. Unlike most of these movies, the lawyer did not give up a love to take her job but in the life &#34;Gina&#34; (Faye Dunaway) takes her to, her husbands a man she only met once. It's a movie about choices and while the ending is much like the others made like this, there is a surprise twist in the way it gets there. It's a nice enjoyable family movie while you're in this spirit of the holidays.",5,Similar storyline with a bit of a twist,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,1592,"['ordered', 'last', 'year', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'buying', 'spirit', 'think', 'Thanksgiving', 'had', 'already', 'passed', 'was', 'long', 'time', 'watched', 'However', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'year', 'so', 'obviously', 'like', 'was', 'surprised', 'see', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'again', 'was', 'probably', 'main', 'reason', 'ordered', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'anything', 'lately', 'important', 'plot', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'lot', 'not', 'unusual', 'storyline', 'So', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'someone', 'who', 'lost', 'loved', 'one', 'time', 'year', 'are', 'so', 'busy', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'holidays', 'movie', 'category', 'work', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'have', 'plot', 'woman', 'ghost', 'got', 'there', 'think', 'part', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'how', 'super', 'busy', 'lawyer', 'was', 'constantly', 'putting', 'down', 'sister', 'who', 'stay-at-home', 'Mom', 'lawyer', 'job', 'life', 'sister', 'nothing', 'lots', 'time', 'nice', 'see', 'working', 'home', 'Mom', 'vindicated', 'super', 'sister', 'learns', 'more', 'life', 'job', 'sister', 'extremely', 'busy', 'being', 'Mom', 'just', 'as', 'important', 'life', 'lawyer', 'most', 'movies', 'lawyer', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'up', 'love', 'take', 'job', 'life', '34', 'Gina', '34', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'husbands', 'man', 'only', 'met', 'once', 'movie', 'choices', 'ending', 'much', 'others', 'made', 'surprise', 'twist', 'way', 'there', 'nice', 'enjoyable', 'family', 'movie', ""'re"", 'spirit', 'holidays']",N/A

I sat thru 2010's A Family Thanksgiving and walked away pretty satisfied. My old crush, Daphne Zuniga, still holds it down. Career-driven trial lawyer Claudia Parks (Zuniga) has no time for the holidays. She, in fact, expects her staff to work thru Thanksgiving. She's been ducking the firm's enigmatic transpersonal psychologist (Faye Dunaway) as Claudia, as well, has no time to for the touchy-feely couch session. And just in case you'd allowed that ""transpersonal psychologist"" bit to pass you by unchallenged, it's a hint that there may be something not quite normal at play.Just two of the many ways in which Claudia - alumna of Harvard law, graduated top of her class - is oblivious to the important things in life: One) When her sister's baby was born, Claudia sent over a Harvard sweatshirt in lieu of showing up in person. Two) Her firm's latest client is a German-based manufacturer that plans to raze the local family park to erect a mill. Claudia is tasked with punching holes in an injunction submitted by concerned townspeople, never mind that her own sister (Gina Holden) is horrified at losing the park.Minutes into the film, Claudia Parks is magically transported to an altered reality in which she's married and had years ago given up her law career to raise her kids. This other Claudia is the perfect mom and wife. And our Claudia, abruptly thrust into domesticity, finds herself coping with her three-year-old daughter's potty training and her pre-teen son's awful grades. And then to demonstrate that some plot points do run parallel, she has to contend with her old firm's going to court to challenge the townpeople's injunction against the looming park demolition. Which side will Claudia back? Has she settled in too comfortably as the suburban housewife? Can she brush off her old lawyery skills and go fight the power? Oh, hey, here comes that weird transpersonal psychologist again.3.5 out of 5 stars for A Family Thanksgiving, a genial holiday film for the entire family. The funny bits are primarily courtesy of Daphne Zuniga's comically flustered behavior as she tries to make hearth and home for her unexpected husband and children. The plot wends its way down an expected path, not that I minded.  You have to be a willing participant; you have to be a savvy sucker. During the holidays, you've got to be a massive grinch to not enjoy these feel-good films, to not root for our empty-hearted protagonist to change her ways.",4,"save the park, save Thanksgiving, get that weird therapist her wings",1388361600,"12 30, 2013",2013,2531,"['ca', ""n't"", 'ever', 'have', 'enough', 'alternate', 'timeline', 'stories', 'am', 'right', 'sat', 'thru', '2010', 'Family', 'Thanksgiving', 'walked', 'away', 'pretty', 'satisfied', 'old', 'crush', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'still', 'down', 'Career-driven', 'trial', 'lawyer', 'Claudia', 'Parks', 'Zuniga', 'time', 'holidays', 'fact', 'staff', 'work', 'thru', 'Thanksgiving', 'been', 'ducking', 'firm', 'enigmatic', 'transpersonal', 'psychologist', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'Claudia', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'touchy-feely', 'couch', 'session', 'just', 'case', ""'d"", 'allowed', 'transpersonal', 'psychologist', 'bit', 'pass', 'unchallenged', 'hint', 'may', 'be', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'normal', 'play.Just', 'two', 'many', 'ways', 'Claudia', 'alumna', 'Harvard', 'law', 'graduated', 'top', 'class', 'oblivious', 'important', 'things', 'life', 'One', 'When', 'sister', 'baby', 'was', 'born', 'Claudia', 'sent', 'over', 'Harvard', 'sweatshirt', 'lieu', 'showing', 'up', 'person', 'Two', 'firm', 'latest', 'client', 'German-based', 'manufacturer', 'raze', 'local', 'family', 'park', 'erect', 'mill', 'Claudia', 'tasked', 'punching', 'holes', 'injunction', 'submitted', 'concerned', 'townspeople', 'never', 'mind', 'own', 'sister', 'Gina', 'Holden', 'horrified', 'losing', 'park.Minutes', 'film', 'Claudia', 'Parks', 'magically', 'transported', 'altered', 'reality', 'married', 'had', 'years', 'ago', 'given', 'up', 'law', 'career', 'raise', 'kids', 'other', 'Claudia', 'perfect', 'mom', 'wife', 'Claudia', 'abruptly', 'thrust', 'domesticity', 'coping', 'three-year-old', 'daughter', 'potty', 'training', 'pre-teen', 'son', 'awful', 'grades', 'then', 'demonstrate', 'plot', 'points', 'do', 'run', 'parallel', 'contend', 'old', 'firm', 'going', 'court', 'challenge', 'townpeople', 'injunction', 'looming', 'park', 'demolition', 'Which', 'side', 'will', 'Claudia', 'back', 'Has', 'settled', 'too', 'comfortably', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'Can', 'brush', 'off', 'old', 'lawyery', 'skills', 'go', 'fight', 'power', 'Oh', 'hey', 'here', 'weird', 'transpersonal', 'psychologist', 'again.3.5', '5', 'stars', 'Family', 'Thanksgiving', 'genial', 'holiday', 'film', 'entire', 'family', 'funny', 'bits', 'are', 'primarily', 'courtesy', 'Daphne', 'Zuniga', 'comically', 'flustered', 'behavior', 'make', 'hearth', 'home', 'unexpected', 'husband', 'children', 'plot', 'way', 'expected', 'path', 'not', 'minded', 'have', 'be', 'willing', 'participant', 'have', 'be', 'savvy', 'sucker', 'holidays', ""'ve"", 'got', 'be', 'massive', 'grinch', 'not', 'enjoy', 'feel-good', 'films', 'not', 'root', 'empty-hearted', 'protagonist', 'change', 'ways']",N/A
