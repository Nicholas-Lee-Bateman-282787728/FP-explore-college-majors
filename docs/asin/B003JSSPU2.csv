1347815,A3JUNX78IUQNV7,B003JSSPU2,"Alasse Sedai ""Lady Alasse""","[1, 2]","There are several reviews already up about what the story is about but here i'll just focus on the dub.I love anime and I watch my anime in English as a general rule. So I was waiting excitedly for this to come out. I've read the manga and have a fairly good understanding of each of the characters. That being said I did not like the voice choices for most of the characters. I realize the Japanese picked the dub voices but Zero should have more ""edge"" to his voice he is NOT a soft or happy person and Vic makes him too soft. Unless he's having a blood craving or angry. Both of those things Vic does very very well...but when he's just talking to Yuki or Kaname he's way to soft not enough edge.Yuki's voice just annoys me but I tried listening to it in Japanese and she annoyed me there too so I think she is supposed to just generally be annoying.Kaname was actually okay, I thought he needed to be a litttle softer in some parts and harder in others but overall of the main three I liked him best.Aido and his cousin were perfectly cast as far as i'm concerned Troy Baker puts in an awesome performance as Akatsuki Kain, Aido's cousin and Kaname's right hand man. While Aido is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook who I have never seen before this. However they were both awesome and very much like there characters.Honorable mention goes out to Steve Staley who plays Shiki, Senri and only had four lines in the first four episodes but made the character in those four lines. I am excited to see him again in the next set. Also Christopher Corey Smith who plays Headmaster Cross was brilliant. I could see Vic playing the headmaster or J Micheal Tatum but Chris Smith did an amazing job and I was very happy with it. I am also excited about Travis Willingham playing the Vampire hunter sent to the school in the next set. That character is made for him and he will be awesome i've got no doubt.But if you like dubs you may enjoy this, and I know my views about the cast will be different for everyone so enjoy it and make up your own mind. I just preferred the sub cast to the main three.",4,Dub review,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,2087,"['are', 'several', 'reviews', 'already', 'up', 'what', 'story', 'here', 'i', ""'ll"", 'just', 'focus', 'dub.I', 'love', 'anime', 'watch', 'anime', 'English', 'general', 'rule', 'was', 'waiting', 'excitedly', 'come', 'out', ""'ve"", 'read', 'manga', 'have', 'fairly', 'good', 'understanding', 'characters', 'being', 'said', 'did', 'not', 'voice', 'choices', 'most', 'characters', 'realize', 'Japanese', 'picked', 'dub', 'voices', 'Zero', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'edge', 'voice', 'NOT', 'soft', 'happy', 'person', 'Vic', 'too', 'soft', 'having', 'blood', 'craving', 'angry', 'things', 'Vic', 'very', 'very', 'well', 'when', 'just', 'talking', 'Yuki', 'Kaname', 'way', 'soft', 'not', 'enough', 'edge.Yuki', 'voice', 'just', 'tried', 'listening', 'Japanese', 'annoyed', 'too', 'so', 'think', 'supposed', 'just', 'generally', 'be', 'annoying.Kaname', 'was', 'actually', 'okay', 'thought', 'needed', 'be', 'litttle', 'softer', 'parts', 'harder', 'others', 'overall', 'main', 'three', 'liked', 'best.Aido', 'cousin', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'as', 'far', 'i', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Troy', 'Baker', 'awesome', 'performance', 'Akatsuki', 'Kain', 'Aido', 'cousin', 'Kaname', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Aido', 'voiced', 'Bryce', 'Papenbrook', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'However', 'were', 'awesome', 'very', 'much', 'characters.Honorable', 'mention', 'out', 'Steve', 'Staley', 'who', 'Shiki', 'Senri', 'only', 'had', 'four', 'lines', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'made', 'character', 'four', 'lines', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'again', 'next', 'set', 'Also', 'Christopher', 'Corey', 'Smith', 'who', 'Headmaster', 'Cross', 'was', 'brilliant', 'could', 'see', 'Vic', 'playing', 'headmaster', 'J', 'Micheal', 'Tatum', 'Chris', 'Smith', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'am', 'also', 'excited', 'Travis', 'Willingham', 'playing', 'Vampire', 'hunter', 'sent', 'school', 'next', 'set', 'character', 'made', 'will', 'be', 'awesome', 'i', ""'ve"", 'got', 'doubt.But', 'like', 'dubs', 'may', 'enjoy', 'know', 'views', 'cast', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'everyone', 'so', 'enjoy', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'just', 'preferred', 'sub', 'cast', 'main', 'three']",N/A

1347818,AER49RJBIWR88,B003JSSPU2,Miim,"[5, 9]","The anime isn't quite as faithful to the manga as the other review claims. Some elements are changed, and while for the most part the story is the same, unfortunately the portrayal of the characters is simplified in an often clumsy way.I would say it's a great fun watch if you already love the manga and don't mind closing your eyes over the many flaws of the anime. But if you never read the manga, you shouldn't make the anime your introduction to VK, or you might dislike the series and its characters. It's far inferior to the manga. It's more of a very lovable bonus if you already like the manga, but it's nowhere as good.Read the manga first, you'll enjoy the series as a whole and the anime in particular more than if you do it the other way around.Also, the Vampire Knight fandom has so far taken rather badly the choice of Vic Mignogna to play Zero, because his voice and acting style are so different from the way Zero normally is in the original.There was a video in which he voiced Zero for a convention, and it sparked outrage among the fans. Many feel that it's a completely different character when voiced by this actor.Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's not a good actor, it's just that he insists on doing all characters his particular way rather than modifying his style to suit each series, and his style is not well suited for this character.At least from the way he voiced him in the convention video, which was completely different from the character's personality. I can only hope that ever since that convention he might have reconsidered his approach of the character.So the fans of Vic Mignogna are happy as the other reviewer is, but him playing Zero might not be the best choice for the series itself, because of his voice and style for him being so different from how the character normally is. (At least if things didn't change since the convention.)If you are a fan of subtitled anime however, this shouldn't be a problem.",4,"Good if you already like the manga.

1347819,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B003JSSPU2,trashcanman,"[11, 15]","""Vampire Knight"" is the story of a high school girl torn between two platonic lovers; or four fangs, in this case.  After all, when it comes to vampire fiction, any horror noob knows that a vampire's bite is essentially synonymous with sex. And since so many romantic anime are so annoyingly coy about physical expressions of affection, that makes vampires a welcome addition to the shojo (girlie anime) genre.  Now the heroine is free to get her rocks off and the boys have to do all the sucking for once.  Now I know what you're thinking: ""is this an anime version of Twilight? Well, sorta kinda, yeah. But it isn't all that bad.  In fact, it wasn't far from being really good. The vampire mythology is unique without deviating too far from established genre norms and some of the characters are quite likeable. As far as vampire anime goes, you could do worse. There have been two seasons, with the second titled ""Vampire Knight Guilty"". This is a review of the first 13-episode season.Yuki is the adoptive daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy; a social experiment where humans go to school during the day, and vampires attend at night. Yuki is a Prefect (guardian), which is to say it's her job to keep the peace along with her partner Zero, who comes from a family of renowned vampire hunters that were slaughtered by a powerful ladyvamp.  Since every girl in the day class is smitten with every boy in the night class-who are prone to temptation- this is a rough job. While Zero's fierce demeanor is enough to keep the screaming throngs of wannabe Bellas in check, the diminutive and soft-spoken Yuki has a comically hard time with crowd control. The vampires and hunters work together to exterminate any stray vampires who go out of control, known as level E's.  The problem is that Zero was bitten by the pureblood who killed his family and has been devolving into a type E ever since due to his body's rejection of the blood tablets that the other vampire's use for sustenance. Yuki has a mad crush on the pureblooded leader of the night class, Kaname, who saved her from a level E when she was little, but she feels obligated to help the suffering Zero which leads her to break the school's deepest taboo and reject her longtime friend and protector.The series mixes splashes of amusing character comedy with some heavier-toned drama. The results are mixed on this.  Any scene with Yuki and Zero is likely to be several minutes of a trembling anime girl with ultra-puppy dog eyes whimpering his name every five seconds and telling him she'll take care of him no matter what.  Then there's the scenes with Kaname and Yuki which is usually her blushing and stammering his name every ten seconds as he cooly stares at her.  Gets old fast.  And on the other side, Headmaster Cross's buffoonish demeanor and nearly incestuous enthusiasm for his adoptive daughter is nothing but irritating. Most of the time, Vampire Knight strikes a pretty good balance, but it regularly tips too far one way or the other. The biggest problem with the first season is that it often doesn't play to it's strengths. There is an entire cast of interesting vampire characters that are barely paid lip service in spite of the fact that they are the main draw. Most of the time is spent on the Zero/Yuki/Kaname love triangle plot which drags the series down often.  But whenever a level E is onscreen, major animated creepiness ensues.  If they'd focused more on the vampire hunting aspect, this would have been an outstanding show.In Vampire Knight the vamps fall into four levels. Level E's are essentially beasts in human form with no self control and will feed on humans every chance they get.  Most of the cast are noble vampires who are able to control themselves to some degree, though are often tempted to partake in the delicacy of human blood.  They each have a superpower, such as controlling an element or one who can use his blood as a weapon similar to the excellent Night Walker anime.  These powers are rarely used in the first season. Pureblood vampires are rare and directly descended from the vamps of old with no human blood mixed into their lineage. They are the only vampires capable of turning a human into one of them, and their status is so exclusive that only they themselves know the extent of their powers. Ex-human vampires have been bitten by a pureblood and slowly devolve into type E's unless their sire decides to bestow the gift of their blood upon them.  All of the characters of Vampire Knight can walk in the day, though it's implied that vamps can get a nasty sunburn from doing so. Biting somebody is a very intimate affair to these guys/gals and can lead to some jealousy, which goes without saying considering the sexual implications.  Prep for drama.Sanctioned vampire hunters have a list of targets that are cleared for extermination. They are not allowed to run amok as there is a human/vampire truce going on.  Only type E's or murderers are executed and nobles or hunters are cleared to do the deed.  The main hunter is actually one of the night class teachers at Cross Academy. Gotta love a sensei who jokes about killing his students that fall asleep during his lectures.  Great character; way underused, though.  In fact, every cast member who isn't Zero, Kaname, Yuki, or Headmaster Cross are underused for most of the season.  And I just named the four lamest characters in the show. I wish they'd focused on the night class more; now there are some interesting characters. But things pick up big time as the first season climaxes. A new cast member shows up with ties to Zero's past (you've already guessed, I'm sure) and she is absolutely fantastic onscreen. Saved the entire series for me, in fact.The soundtrack to Vampire Knight is pretty good, with lots of traditional gothic organs setting the appropriate mood. The opening and closing credits are solid as well. The art is very nice to look at and somewhat resembles a darker Death Note, which is high praise. And as always, I love the creepiness of the glowing red eyes.  Overall, the series is probably a must for anime fans who are into gothic vampire melodrama, and a casual recommendation for general nosferatu freaks like myself.  I could name at least half a dozen vampire animes that are better off the top of my head, but with the success of Twilight, this one is all set to break big when it comes to America.  It may even create a new wave of otaku.  Don't know how I feel about that.  The horror and violence in this is pretty light and there are but a few action scenes in the 13 episodes of the first season, but there is a good story here with some outstanding supporting characters so as long as you aren't expecting Hellsing you'll probably have a good time with Vampire Knight.",3,A little something for the vampire romantics out there,1277251200,"06 23,
