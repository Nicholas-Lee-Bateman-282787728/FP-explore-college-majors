760508,A3CJE9CW4TNW7P,B0000A02V9,Benjamin E. Cressy,"[27, 28]","I bought this DVD solely for HONDO AND THE APACHES. I was a fan of the series around 1994 when TNT was airing it regularly. When they pulled it I missed it until this DVD came out. Boy was I sorry I bought it.The DVD looks like it was mastered from an old film print, maybe even an old VHS tape due to some of the print damage that looks like video-tape ""snow"" rather than damage to an old film print. On top of that, it should be 85 minutes long, and is only a mere 72 minutes. The quality of the other film, THE MAN CALLED NOON, is no better. I'm used to cheap budget DVDs, but when parts of the movie are missing, I have to complain.",2,"Love the movie, but hated the DVD",1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,636,"['bought', 'DVD', 'solely', 'HONDO', 'THE', 'APACHES', 'was', 'fan', 'series', '1994', 'when', 'TNT', 'was', 'airing', 'regularly', 'When', 'pulled', 'missed', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'Boy', 'was', 'sorry', 'bought', 'it.The', 'DVD', 'was', 'mastered', 'old', 'film', 'print', 'maybe', 'even', 'old', 'VHS', 'tape', 'due', 'print', 'damage', 'video-tape', 'snow', 'rather', 'damage', 'old', 'film', 'print', 'top', 'should', 'be', '85', 'minutes', 'long', 'only', 'mere', '72', 'minutes', 'quality', 'other', 'film', 'MAN', 'CALLED', 'NOON', 'better', ""'m"", 'used', 'cheap', 'budget', 'DVDs', 'when', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'missing', 'have', 'complain']",N/A

Not only is the picture quality atrocious, in general, the sound is badly muffled in places on ""A Man Called Noon"" and the colour is all washed out in ""Hondo"".  Both are shown full screen.  And as one reviewer said, halfway through Noon, the DVD quits.  in Hondo, another viewer tells us 13 min. of film are missing.  No wonder there appears to be Grand Canyon gaps in the story, especially between Robert Taylor's character and his new found son.  I have a VHS copy of Noon and I think it is actually cleaner with better sound.""A Man Called Noon"" is one of Louis l'Amour's finer novels and the movie benefits from Richard Crenna as Noon, but even more from Stephen Boyd's (Massala in Ben Hur) character JP Rimes.  This movie was shot in either Spain, Mexico, or Italy and has a typical spaghetti western flavour....windy vistas, creaky ghost towns, Serge Leone close-ups and the dead give-away Spanish steam engine made to look like an American engine pulling a Spanish train made to look American.  Stephen Boyd, I think, has always been an under-rated actor and it is so obvious in Ben-Hur after Massala dies, Heston has a hard time carrying the last third of the picture.  Same here.  Although Crenna does well, it is the scenes with Boyd that steal the show.  Overall I would rate it 3.5 stars, mainly because of the crummy DVD presentation ruins a respectable production.Hondo and the Apaches is an MGM production filmed in the US and although a lot of fun to watch, suffers from a lousy DVD presentation, 13 minutes of film missing, and most seriously from none of the Apaches being Apaches.  Veteran Italian actors stand in for tough, hard nosed Apache chiefs.  In fact, Hondo looks more Apache than all of them.  While not even close to John Wayne's portrayal, this one does have its merits...Noah Beery Jr.and Ralph Taegar both give admirable performances as does Kathy Browne, despite the 60s hairstyle....and Robert Taylor's character Gallagher is solid. I give this one 3 stars.  Both of these old oaters deserve a good presentation in original widescreen formats with all the film included.",3,Poor DVD quality ruins 2 good ole' Oaters!!,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,2218,"['completely', 'agree', 'previous', 'writers', 'movies', 'are', 'bad', 'copies', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Not', 'only', 'picture', 'quality', 'atrocious', 'general', 'sound', 'badly', 'muffled', 'places', 'A', 'Man', 'Called', 'Noon', 'colour', 'washed', 'out', 'Hondo', 'are', 'shown', 'full', 'screen', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'halfway', 'Noon', 'DVD', 'quits', 'Hondo', 'viewer', '13', 'min', 'film', 'are', 'missing', 'wonder', 'there', 'be', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'gaps', 'story', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'character', 'new', 'found', 'son', 'have', 'VHS', 'copy', 'Noon', 'think', 'actually', 'cleaner', 'better', 'sound', 'Man', 'Called', 'Noon', 'one', 'Louis', ""l'Amour"", 'finer', 'novels', 'movie', 'benefits', 'Richard', 'Crenna', 'Noon', 'even', 'more', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'Massala', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'character', 'JP', 'Rimes', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'Spain', 'Mexico', 'Italy', 'typical', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'flavour', '.windy', 'vistas', 'creaky', 'ghost', 'towns', 'Serge', 'Leone', 'close-ups', 'dead', 'give-away', 'Spanish', 'steam', 'engine', 'made', 'look', 'American', 'engine', 'pulling', 'Spanish', 'train', 'made', 'look', 'American', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'think', 'always', 'been', 'under-rated', 'actor', 'so', 'obvious', 'Ben-Hur', 'Massala', 'Heston', 'hard', 'time', 'carrying', 'last', 'third', 'picture', 'Same', 'here', 'Crenna', 'well', 'scenes', 'Boyd', 'steal', 'show', 'Overall', 'would', 'rate', '3.5', 'stars', 'mainly', 'crummy', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'respectable', 'production.Hondo', 'Apaches', 'MGM', 'production', 'filmed', 'US', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'suffers', 'lousy', 'DVD', 'presentation', '13', 'minutes', 'film', 'missing', 'most', 'seriously', 'none', 'Apaches', 'being', 'Apaches', 'Veteran', 'Italian', 'actors', 'stand', 'tough', 'hard', 'nosed', 'Apache', 'chiefs', 'fact', 'Hondo', 'more', 'Apache', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'John', 'Wayne', 'portrayal', 'one', 'have', 'merits', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.and', 'Ralph', 'Taegar', 'give', 'admirable', 'performances', 'Kathy', 'Browne', '60s', 'hairstyle', '.and', 'Robert', 'Taylor', 'character', 'Gallagher', 'solid', 'give', 'one', '3', 'stars', 'old', 'oaters', 'deserve', 'good', 'presentation', 'original', 'widescreen', 'formats', 'film', 'included']",N/A

I had a VHS copy of this a long time ago, it was lousy, but I thought it was just ""the nature of the beast"", so to speak. I was hoping that because this was advertised as being remastered, it would be nearly pristine. Guess what? Just as lousy a print as the VHS was. I don't blame either AMAZON or the company that I purchased it through. I received it in good time and the packaging was quite good. It was the print itself that was worse than anyone could expect for a DVD. I returned it for a refund and received the refund in rapid ""turn around"" time. All in all I would recommend both AMAZON and the company that I purchased it from , HIGHLY. Can't expect any better service than what they provided. Certainly they had no way of knowing that the print of the movie was of very very low quality. I'm truly disappointed that some companies are purveyers of such junk.
