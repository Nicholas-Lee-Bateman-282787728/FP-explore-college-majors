It is based on the real story about real domesticated animals that were sent on a mission into space in Russia. The first dogs that were sent into space: Belka and Strelka. Beautifully made, great songs, great characters and a beautiful happy end. There were touching moments where I actually had to give a few happy tears away. I'm so glad I watched it and some characters were just too cute! What can I say? I just loved the animation and the story itself!",5,Totally awesome and totally worth my time,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",2012,487,"['loved', 'animated', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'story', 'real', 'domesticated', 'animals', 'were', 'sent', 'mission', 'space', 'Russia', 'first', 'dogs', 'were', 'sent', 'space', 'Belka', 'Strelka', 'Beautifully', 'made', 'great', 'songs', 'great', 'characters', 'beautiful', 'happy', 'end', 'were', 'touching', 'moments', 'where', 'actually', 'had', 'give', 'few', 'happy', 'tears', 'away', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'watched', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'just', 'loved', 'animation', 'story']",Space Dogs
1519287,A3R7PQAHD3NZM0,B006QWC33S,Autumn Blues Reviews,"[6, 9]","Originally released in Russian, this animated adventure was released to mark the 50th anniversary of the first space flights featuring dogs. Space Dogs is based on a true tale of two dogs from the Soviet Union space program named Belka and Strelka who were a few of the dogs originally sent to space who were returned safely. This film was a conversation starter and a good way to teach my son some history about the first space missions. In the movie Belka and Strelka and their friend the rat called Venya team up on the street and later end up on a secret mission where unknown to them they are being trained to be cosmonauts. In the end this film is about courage, team work and friendship.My family loved this film and we found ourselves laughing along with all the antics. The movie also has it's occasional teary moments, but most of the movie is comical and fun. We gave this movie 4 stars for this DVD version. I am sure the animation stands out better in the 3D version. Overall it is a great film for family bonding.",4,A cute animated tale based on the Soviet Unions animal space program,1336089600,"05 4, 2012",2012,1027,"['Originally', 'released', 'Russian', 'animated', 'adventure', 'was', 'released', 'mark', '50th', 'anniversary', 'first', 'space', 'flights', 'featuring', 'dogs', 'Space', 'Dogs', 'based', 'true', 'tale', 'two', 'dogs', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'space', 'program', 'named', 'Belka', 'Strelka', 'who', 'were', 'few', 'dogs', 'originally', 'sent', 'space', 'who', 'were', 'returned', 'safely', 'film', 'was', 'conversation', 'starter', 'good', 'way', 'teach', 'son', 'history', 'first', 'space', 'missions', 'movie', 'Belka', 'Strelka', 'friend', 'rat', 'called', 'Venya', 'team', 'up', 'street', 'later', 'end', 'up', 'secret', 'mission', 'where', 'unknown', 'are', 'being', 'trained', 'be', 'cosmonauts', 'end', 'film', 'courage', 'team', 'work', 'friendship.My', 'family', 'loved', 'film', 'found', 'laughing', 'antics', 'movie', 'also', 'occasional', 'teary', 'moments', 'most', 'movie', 'comical', 'fun', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'DVD', 'version', 'am', 'sure', 'animation', 'out', 'better', '3D', 'version', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', 'family', 'bonding']",Space Dogs

1519289,A356RFKNIG043B,B006QWC33S,K. Swanson,"[0, 2]","Wow, what a scam this half-baked 'toon is.They very carefully HIDE the fact that it's Russian on the box, which is clearly by design, because when it comes to piracy, that nation takes a backseat only to China, and this movie is pure piracy.They steal almost every trick in the Pixar book, from the look of the dogs to the movement of every character to the dialogue feel, etc etc. Not that any of it is very good, mind you. The one thing they really couldn't even pretend to steal is the quality of the animation, which is 1990-level at best. There is no clarity or depth in any of the images here. The colors are washed out and never pop from the screen like Up or The Incredibles or Kung Fu Panda or any of the other truly fine animated features of the last decade. Nor do the dogs or people have any of the feel of those truly fine 'toons. All in all, this is, for 2012, F-grade animation.Add weak voice work and you've got a real dog, however twee the premise.It's also full of really weird pro-CCCP/Russian propaganda, ironically, because the only thing I took from this is that Russia was just lots of sweet fun for all in the recently post-Stalinist era. Alrighty then...just don't tell the folks who lost tens of millions of family members in the various Stalin etc pogroms.This might be good for very young kids, and those who don't care about the art of animation (or truthful history), but for those who know what real quality is, and know what straight-up theft looks like when they see it, however weak, Space Dogs is a weak and childish propaganda mess, and well worth avoiding.",1,"Ridiculous and lame Pixar ripoff, without the quality or originality",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1593,"['Wow', 'what', 'scam', 'half-baked', ""'toon"", 'is.They', 'very', 'carefully', 'HIDE', 'fact', 'Russian', 'box', 'clearly', 'design', 'when', 'piracy', 'nation', 'backseat', 'only', 'China', 'movie', 'pure', 'piracy.They', 'steal', 'almost', 'trick', 'Pixar', 'book', 'look', 'dogs', 'movement', 'character', 'dialogue', 'feel', 'etc', 'etc', 'Not', 'very', 'good', 'mind', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'steal', 'quality', 'animation', '1990-level', 'best', 'clarity', 'depth', 'images', 'here', 'colors', 'are', 'washed', 'never', 'pop', 'screen', 'Up', 'Incredibles', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Panda', 'other', 'truly', 'fine', 'animated', 'features', 'last', 'decade', 'do', 'dogs', 'people', 'have', 'feel', 'truly', 'fine', ""'toons"", '2012', 'F-grade', 'weak', 'voice', 'work', ""'ve"", 'got', 'real', 'dog', 'however', 'premise.It', 'also', 'full', 'really', 'weird', 'pro-CCCP/Russian', 'propaganda', 'ironically', 'only', 'thing', 'took', 'Russia', 'was', 'just', 'lots', 'sweet', 'fun', 'recently', 'post-Stalinist', 'era', 'Alrighty', 'then', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'folks', 'who', 'lost', 'tens', 'millions', 'family', 'members', 'various', 'Stalin', 'etc', 'pogroms.This', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'very', 'young', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'art', 'animation', 'truthful', 'history', 'who', 'know', 'what', 'real', 'quality', 'know', 'what', 'straight-up', 'theft', 'looks', 'when', 'see', 'however', 'weak', 'Space', 'Dogs', 'weak', 'childish', 'propaganda', 'mess', 'well', 'worth', 'avoiding']",Space Dogs

The movie is based on a true story which had my kids heads reeling ""what? they sent two dogs into space?"" I was explaining to the kids that 50 years ago two dogs went into space, returned safely, the girl Strelka eventually gave birth to puppies, with one of the puppies sent to President John F. Kennedy's daughter Caroline Kennedy and are now stuffed in the  Cosmonaut Museum in Moscow.All this information made them even more interested in the movie. We all truly loved the story of these animal friends and their sweet faces as they worked together.
