The next minute the style of humor switches completely into a much dirtier and downright *disgusting* direction.I assume this was done because the writers wanted to make this film a comedy for both men and women alike.  The problem is, men and women will be spending much of their time either bored or disgusted (and probably confused).I don't know what else to say about it.  I was laughing quite hard on a few occasions, but other times I couldn't believe the words the characters were saying to each other (and I don't mean cute and innocent little swear words either).The story involving a pregnant woman going through her hectic career without her boss knowing she's actually pregnant was the only time my interest went up for a short period.Don't expect Baby on Board to be a comedy that pertains to your sense of humor because frankly, a movie like this isn't able to connect to *anyones* sense of humor.",3,"sometimes the jokes work, other times they don't",1270425600,"04 5, 2010",2010,1023,"['Baby', 'Board', 'bit', 'strange', 'say', 'least.One', 'moment', 'jokes', 'are', 'innocent', 'clean', 'almost', 'adorable', 'next', 'minute', 'style', 'humor', 'switches', 'completely', 'much', 'dirtier', 'downright', '*disgusting*', 'direction.I', 'assume', 'was', 'done', 'writers', 'wanted', 'make', 'film', 'comedy', 'men', 'women', 'alike', 'problem', 'men', 'women', 'will', 'be', 'spending', 'much', 'time', 'bored', 'disgusted', 'probably', 'confused', '.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'say', 'was', 'laughing', 'quite', 'hard', 'few', 'occasions', 'other', 'times', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'words', 'characters', 'were', 'saying', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'cute', 'innocent', 'little', 'swear', 'words', '.The', 'story', 'involving', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'going', 'hectic', 'career', 'boss', 'knowing', 'actually', 'pregnant', 'was', 'only', 'time', 'interest', 'went', 'up', 'short', 'period.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Baby', 'Board', 'be', 'comedy', 'sense', 'humor', 'frankly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'able', 'connect', '*anyones*', 'sense', 'humor']",Baby on Board

1243649,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B001VG2M7Q,Enjolras,"[8, 11]","This movie seems like part of a trend among many recent romantic comedies to substitute vulgarity and silliness for true comedy. The plot twists were often unbelievable, even for a romantic comedy. At several points, people make out wildly in restaurants, jumping on top of each other and groping wildly (which I've frankly never seen in a public restaurant). After the first 5 minutes there was little change in the plot and the ending was an entirely predictable. Throughout the movie, I felt like the main characters were almost purposely miscommunicating simply because they had to propel the plot.

1243655,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001VG2M7Q,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[6, 6]","""Baby on Board""  stars Heather Graham and Jerry O'Connell as Angela and Curtis, who have a loving relationship, a comfortable home, and successful careers.  When Angela announces she's pregnant, however, their lives turn into a nine-month comedy of errors in which each suspects the other of cheating.  Now, they must contend with both emotional and hormonal mood swings, as well as the unanticipated drama caused by their friends Danny (John Corbett) and Sylvie (Katie Finneran), who suddenly find their own marriage in peril.  Through all this, Angela worries that her job is in jeopardy as she strives to please her demanding boss (Lara Flynn Boyle).Watching a movie like ""Baby On Board,"" one really appreciates star power.  Though the performers are all good and sometimes land the gags with good timing, it's tough to be engaged fully.  O'Connell has the ability to play both the goofy fall guy and the romantic lead, yet here he's somewhere in the middle.  Boyle scores points as the boss from hell, as she manages to elicit sympathy for what could have been a one-note performance.
