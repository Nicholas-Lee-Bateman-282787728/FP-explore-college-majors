1509181,A144BX2IT6AQAL,B0063SC6H8,Desdimona,"[0, 0]","This mini series is interesting, but not all of the story threads are brought to life or resolved.  And by not fleshing the stories out or resolving them it makes the overall experience unfulfilling.  The story that isn't told is that of the Aboriginal girls that used to live in the house, Cloudstreet.  The aboriginal man that floats around the house is also not explained or resolved.Racially this is more than a little irritating because the Aboriginal stories lead you deeper into the stories of the Lamb and Pickles families.  There is a very disturbing scene of little Aboriginal girls hanging over the house as if they had been lynched or committed suicide.  This is never further revealed or explained.Overall movie was interesting but seemed to be trying hard to be so, using a little shock, a little oddity, and a little whatever as devices to boost the interest factor.  Overall I could deal with this.  But the stories of the Aboriginals crashed this movie for me.  Their use as devices is very discouraging.Through their portrayals the writer, Winton, seems to be trying to include the mistreatment of Aboriginal people by white Australian society in the story.  The history of Aboriginal people in Australia becomes a real force in this film, but the stories of the Aboriginals shown are given short shrift.  So with these two treatments of Aboriginals in the film, even though a wrong of history is acknowledged, in the end there is a feeling that the Aboriginal characters and the Aboriginal history in the film are shallow devices by Winton to create interest, more than they and Australia's history are supposed to be really a part of the story.Perhaps Winton's inclusion of the Aboriginal presence is genuinely supposed to illuminate aspects of Australia's history, and perhaps the Aboriginal characters are supposed to be as real as the rest.  If so, facing head on the disturbing history of Cloudstreet, the headmistress, and the Aboriginal girls could have pulled the story through, if paired with also giving some grounding to the Aboriginal man.",3,"Most of the story is extensively developed, but the Aboriginals become devices",1401667200,"06 2, 2014",2014,2070,"['mini', 'series', 'interesting', 'not', 'story', 'threads', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'resolved', 'not', 'fleshing', 'stories', 'out', 'resolving', 'overall', 'experience', 'unfulfilling', 'story', ""n't"", 'told', 'Aboriginal', 'girls', 'used', 'live', 'house', 'Cloudstreet', 'aboriginal', 'man', 'house', 'also', 'not', 'explained', 'resolved.Racially', 'more', 'little', 'irritating', 'Aboriginal', 'stories', 'lead', 'deeper', 'stories', 'Lamb', 'Pickles', 'families', 'very', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'little', 'Aboriginal', 'girls', 'hanging', 'house', 'had', 'been', 'lynched', 'committed', 'suicide', 'never', 'further', 'revealed', 'explained.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'interesting', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'hard', 'be', 'so', 'using', 'little', 'shock', 'little', 'oddity', 'little', 'devices', 'boost', 'interest', 'factor', 'Overall', 'could', 'deal', 'stories', 'Aboriginals', 'crashed', 'movie', 'use', 'devices', 'very', 'discouraging.Through', 'portrayals', 'writer', 'Winton', 'be', 'trying', 'include', 'mistreatment', 'Aboriginal', 'people', 'white', 'Australian', 'society', 'story', 'history', 'Aboriginal', 'people', 'Australia', 'real', 'force', 'film', 'stories', 'Aboriginals', 'shown', 'are', 'given', 'short', 'shrift', 'So', 'two', 'treatments', 'Aboriginals', 'film', 'even', 'wrong', 'history', 'acknowledged', 'end', 'feeling', 'Aboriginal', 'characters', 'Aboriginal', 'history', 'film', 'are', 'shallow', 'devices', 'Winton', 'create', 'interest', 'more', 'Australia', 'history', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'really', 'part', 'story.Perhaps', 'Winton', 'inclusion', 'Aboriginal', 'presence', 'genuinely', 'supposed', 'illuminate', 'aspects', 'Australia', 'history', 'perhaps', 'Aboriginal', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'as', 'real', 'rest', 'so', 'facing', 'head', 'disturbing', 'history', 'Cloudstreet', 'headmistress', 'Aboriginal', 'girls', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'story', 'paired', 'also', 'giving', 'grounding', 'Aboriginal', 'man']",N/A

Strange situation, peculiar characters drive this series based on Australia's most popular novel. Dysfunctional with a capitol ""D"". Depiction of poor, low-class, depressed people not unlike though lives encountered in Oklahoma's ""Grapes of Wrath"" or Ireland's ""Angela's Ashes."" But this Cloudstreet lot of whackos can't seem to help themselves. The acting is good enough to repulse intellectual viewers. Not Pulitzer level.SDH SUBTITLES for all 6 episodes of this story told through the mind of the brain-damaged Fish Lamb.~~~~~1 Lamb boy is mentally injured in a near-drowning. Sam Pickles loses fingers on his working hand then inherits a house; but he's a gambler with a wife & 3 kids. The Lamb parents with 6 kids lease half the house, yard, & even get their own private privy. Filmed around Perth, Australia.~~~~~2 Oriel & Lester lamb open a store, growing food in their yard; intent on bettering their lot. Dolly Pickles takes to drink & men. Simple Fish latches on to a pig while his brother Quick witnesses an accident. It's a hard life on Cloud Street as WWII ends.~~~~~3 Years later, both families yet sharing the house, except for Orry who prefers canvas I in the back yard. Terrible, horrible lives continue plaguing members. Troublesome to watch. One child can take no more.~~~~~4 Bob Crab's still in the area, a man who has unfinished business with the house. A Lamb boy spreads despair beyond the family. Pa Pickles goes into hiding from betting debt; his wife leashes her lust on Pa Lamb, easy pickin's being a man long without.~~~~~5 Grief again visits the Cloud Street abode. Will it come again? Quick returns glowing like a space alien. Weird. A pig sings. What's with that? It does follow the Outback best selling book believe it or not. Rose Pickles is ashamed.~~~~~6 another consenting Pickles/Lamb couple. Sam Pickles considers selling his house. Secrets unfold--but don't expect them to pull the family from the gutter. A family ""do"" is a pathetic heart-warming sort of way.A mixing of sci-fi, fantasy, nonsensical segments, into the plot complicates the story. Special effects seem senseless for the period story.

Also, a good amount of tragedy and some comedy ensues, but love and new birth offer redemption.My favorite character, besides Fox's, is a wonderful talking pig, apparently a reincarnated sea captain who sings chanties and dances a hornpipe, and (more realistically) expects to end up on the table at Christmas.

1509185,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B0063SC6H8,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As I understand it, Tim Winton's ""Cloudstreet"" is virtually required reading in the Australian educational system. It is both studied and beloved as a contemporary masterpiece. When a TV miniseries adaptation was announced, it was met with enormous anticipation. Some claim that this is as solid an interpretation as you're likely to get considering the complexity of the source material. Others have claimed that the series misses the mark somewhat, once again citing that the book itself would be extremely difficult to bring to life. The narrative includes an immense cast, it is spread over several decades, and there is a metaphysical (even surreal or magical) element that oftentimes removes the tale from the land of the conventional. As this DVD release is offered toward the North American marketplace, it's fair to assume that many of those that discover it will not have had the benefit of reading the novel. I, myself, fall into that camp and am looking at ""Cloudstreet"" from the perspective of someone who is new to the story. Sometimes intoxicating, sometimes maddening--I will say that this six part series is wholly unique. I wanted to love it more than I did, but it is certainly never less than fascinating and wildly ambitious. Recommended for serious audiences (this is a not a casual view), one thing is for certain--""Cloudstreet"" never plays it safe.The story revolves around two rural working class families that decide to share a residence in a suburb of Perth. Both are coming from years of struggle, and one family is coping with a recent tragedy. This immense new home begins to symbolize new life, new possibility. Over the episodes, the house itself is a central and stabilizing character in its own right--the thing that repeatedly keeps the disparate plot threads tied together. It is almost impossible to give you an quick glimpse as to the plot, this is largely a character piece. As episodes progress, you will get to learn more about the family members. Each is trying to carve out an existence, find happiness, contentment and connectivity in a history filled with poverty and tumult. Starting in the early forties and continuing for two decades, we see the effects of World War II through the Korean War and even President Kennedy's fateful day in Dallas. Many world events help shape their lives, even if indirectly and unknowingly. It's an intimate (but somewhat crowded) story written across the backdrop of history.What distinguishes ""Cloudstreet"" is its representation of the underprivileged. Its characters are defined by concepts such as class, home and family but no one wants to be pigeonholed to preset expectations. In its most unorthodox element, one boy sustains a near-fatal injury that changes everyone's life irrevocably and lends itself to some of the more mystical or fanciful elements of the narrative. In the end, ""Cloudstreet"" is enormous in scope. I wasn't always as connected as I might have liked, there is simply a lot of ground to cover. The first episode, in particular, throws a lot at you at once. But once you settle past the initial set-up, you just find yourself going with the flow as the years slip by. An ambitious endeavor geared toward an adult audience looking for something a bit different, ""Cloudstreet"" is certainly memorable if not perfect.

1509190,A1PXA18XT1SM5Q,B0063SC6H8,Ultrarunner,"[0, 0]","I have read the classic book Cloud street, and the mini series captures the essence of the book. Poor people struggling in life, that live in a run down house, but we also see what their lives were like before they ended up here. Set during the Second World War, through to the early 1960's.  One family has an alcoholic mother, caused by her childhood, married to a crippled husband. The other family started out with nothing and builds a business in this house. The father is a First war vet, and the mother lost her family in a bush fire. Their youngest son is brain damaged by drowning. Seems pretty depressing, but it is'nt. You can view the mini series in a superfical manner, or attempt to understand the many hidden layers if you wish.The house was left to one of the families by a uncle. It had formarily been a school for Aboriginal children; teaching them how to be whites. However, two  young Aboriginal girls hang themselves. This is where Aboriginal belief systems come into the series; also out of spirit experiences, created in a most poetic manner.  Basically, the story is about a house that breaths, that has a positive effect upon the inhabitants. But the book and film is much more than that. It is about the human spirit, which is able to endure adversity, and allows the human spirit to bloom in adverse circumstances ; causing individuals to develop in a most positive manner. A fairy tale with a message, told in an every day way; sometimes with a droll sense of humour, that American's might miss.  Tim Winton, a West Aussie like me, has the ability to write about down to earth characters and bring in a mystical subtlity to his work. His books always makes you think, like this mini series, which he co -authored.Set around Perth where I live. And shot in the historical locations, in the suburbs of Nedlands, Claremont, the University of West Australia and the city of Fremantle, with the true character of the series, the Swan river.  However, having a slight grasp of Aboriginal belief systems and Eastern mysticism does help. A beloved book and mini series, with great Australian actors. If you have not seen any Australian films, you are missing a great deal.
