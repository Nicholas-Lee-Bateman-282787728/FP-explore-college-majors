What surprises me is that I remember a brief ending with one of them called ""The Jinx."" After Orval seemingly saves the McCoy family from an explosion (planned by Grandpa, Luke and Pepino), there is an additional ending where a letter is received that Orval is back with his father, a happy man. His father writes that Orval was helping him with pounding posts. Then he tells them to please excuse the handwriting. It will be better when the doctor takes the splints off his arms. (I remember that episode especially.) What happened to those particular endings?I am delighted that the TV series is on DVD now. I only wish you had the whole set of them.

I went to see if season 4 is available yet and they have combined season 3 and 4.  You can't get just season 4!! I don't want another copy of season 3!! What a dirty trick.

These shows were so good but to do this is terrible. I just hope the Box set of the 1st season coming out is complete or I will definitely return it. Back in the 1950's - 1960's all half hour shows were 26 min. and the hour shows were 52 min. Nowadays the shows run 22min and 44min for hour shows( and sometime they run even less ). But to release the old stuff on DVD they should be un-cut or else don't put them out.,1,""" These  Shows  Are  All  Edited""",1177027200,"04 20, 2007",2007,529,"['Come', 'Why', 'company', 'do', 'episodes', 'set', 'Misssing', 'four', 'minutes', 'footage', 'shows', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'do', 'terrible', 'just', 'hope', 'Box', 'set', '1st', 'season', 'coming', 'out', 'complete', 'will', 'definitely', 'return', 'Back', '1950', '1960', 'half', 'hour', 'shows', 'were', '26', 'min', 'hour', 'shows', 'were', '52', 'min', 'shows', 'run', '22min', '44min', 'hour', 'shows', 'sometime', 'run', 'even', 'less', 'release', 'old', 'stuff', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'un-cut', 'else', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'out']",The Real McCoys Volumes 3 & 4
