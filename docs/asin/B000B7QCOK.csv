937241,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,B000B7QCOK,&#308;&#308;,"[1, 1]","""Prevention: Dance It Off!"" is an express workout, which means it has several 10-minute segments intended for you to do just one on a busy day or all when you have the time.  It's kind of like the ""10 Minute Solution"" series.  This is led by Jennifer Galardi who did a great job leading as always.  The 6 parts of the workout were:Warm-Up-A little bit of Jazz choreography before leading in some plies and leg warm ups.  A really fun warm-up.  I could tell from this that the rest of the DVD would be great!Hip-Hop-Just like Jennifer says at the end of this routine, these are some fresh moves.  I've never seen anything quite like them.  They are really unique, freestylin', and fun!  It's probably the highest cardio of all the routines, and it is really fun!Latin-This teaches you moves from various genres of Latin dance such as the Cha-Cha, Merengue, and Salsa.  It was my favorite routine, and it did get my heart rate up.  It has a lot of twisting, but I didn't find it that hard to do on carpet.Jazz-This routine I found the most basic of all the routines except for the ""Drama"" step.  It has a complicated rhythm change that took me a while to get used to.  Otherwise it is a pleasant mixture of familiar moves that are a lot of fun!Ballet-This is not a routine like the other workouts, but it is rather just ballet moves taight to you one at a time.  It is not cardio, rather it is for toning, but I feel no results at all.  This is a total zero for me unless I wanted to learn basic ballet moves, and I don't.  It is not a workout at all.Cool-Down-This is a nice mixture of stretches for the legs, but don't expect any for the arms.  You don't work out the arms that much in the routines, so it is understandable.  There is no dancing, just stretching which I loved!This is a great workout from Prevention and Jennifer Galardi, and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the ballet segment which some people will love.  I didn't, but I loved everything else there is about this DVD.",4,Everything is great except the ballet section,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1995,"['Prevention', 'Dance', 'Off', 'express', 'workout', 'several', '10-minute', 'segments', 'intended', 'do', 'just', 'one', 'busy', 'day', 'when', 'have', 'time', 'kind', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'series', 'led', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'who', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'leading', 'always', '6', 'parts', 'workout', 'were', 'Warm-Up-A', 'little', 'bit', 'Jazz', 'choreography', 'leading', 'plies', 'leg', 'warm', 'ups', 'really', 'fun', 'warm-up', 'could', 'tell', 'rest', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Hip-Hop-Just', 'Jennifer', 'end', 'routine', 'are', 'fresh', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'are', 'really', 'unique', 'freestylin', 'fun', 'probably', 'highest', 'cardio', 'routines', 'really', 'fun', 'Latin-This', 'teaches', 'moves', 'various', 'genres', 'Latin', 'dance', 'such', 'Cha-Cha', 'Merengue', 'Salsa', 'was', 'favorite', 'routine', 'did', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'lot', 'twisting', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'hard', 'do', 'carpet.Jazz-This', 'routine', 'found', 'most', 'basic', 'routines', 'Drama', 'step', 'complicated', 'rhythm', 'change', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'Otherwise', 'pleasant', 'mixture', 'familiar', 'moves', 'are', 'lot', 'fun', 'Ballet-This', 'not', 'routine', 'other', 'workouts', 'rather', 'just', 'ballet', 'moves', 'taight', 'one', 'time', 'not', 'cardio', 'rather', 'toning', 'feel', 'results', 'total', 'zero', 'wanted', 'learn', 'basic', 'ballet', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'not', 'workout', 'all.Cool-Down-This', 'nice', 'mixture', 'stretches', 'legs', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'arms', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'arms', 'much', 'routines', 'understandable', 'dancing', 'just', 'stretching', 'loved', 'great', 'workout', 'Prevention', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'would', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'ballet', 'segment', 'people', 'will', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'loved', 'everything', 'else', 'DVD']",Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!

However, I should have listened more to the other reviewers who said the instruction is bad... it isn't just bad, it doesn't exist!!! I think the dance sequences would be fairly easy, IF they were broken down better, and there were some simple instructions as you're going along! But there really aren't, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're spending the whole time trying to figure out what the dancers on screen are doing. Honestly...don't waste your time with this one, unless you enjoy being frustrated and have plenty of spare time to learn the routines and get them down before you actually start getting a good workout!",2,Pretty much a waste of time,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,748,"['have', 'very', 'limited', 'time', 'workout', 'hoped', 'would', 'be', 'quick', 'effective', 'FUN', 'workout', 'lighter', 'days', 'However', 'should', 'have', 'listened', 'more', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'said', 'instruction', 'bad', ""n't"", 'just', 'bad', ""n't"", 'exist', 'think', 'dance', 'sequences', 'would', 'be', 'fairly', 'easy', 'IF', 'were', 'broken', 'down', 'better', 'were', 'simple', 'instructions', ""'re"", 'going', 'along', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'hard', 'get', 'good', 'workout', 'when', ""'re"", 'spending', 'whole', 'time', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'dancers', 'screen', 'are', 'doing', 'Honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'one', 'enjoy', 'being', 'frustrated', 'have', 'plenty', 'spare', 'time', 'learn', 'routines', 'get', 'down', 'actually', 'start', 'getting', 'good', 'workout']",Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!
937243,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000B7QCOK,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[2, 2]","I was interested in trying this workout because I really enjoy10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix, also by Jennifer Galardi.  What I love about that workout is that the segments are fun and easy-to-follow, yet they definitely get my heart rate up, so I was hoping for the the same here.  The Main Menu of this DVD lists the following options:  Warm-Up, Hip-Hop, Latin, Jazz, Ballet, Cool-Down.  There is also a Bonus section that includes a recipe for a Health Boosting Smoothie, 5 Great Ab Shapers (instruction on 5 Pilates moves), and Rev Up Your Energy (tips on breath & posture).The 5 1/2 minute Warm-Up was easy-to-follow, with moves like easy taps, V-steps, and triple steps, although it didn't really do much to raise my heart rate.  The Hip Hop segment was about 11 minutes long.  Of the three cardio segments, I'd rate this one as the most fun.  Galardi teaches in a manner similar to how she does in the 10 Minute Solution video--i.e., she introduces a small piece of choreography, has you practice several times, and then moves on to the next piece, gradually adding on.  However, there isn't too much ""take it from the top,"" as you only repeat the entire routine a few times through at the end.I found the choreography for the Hip Hop segment slightly tricky but doable; unfortunately, however, I struggled even more with the Latin (10.5 mins) and Jazz (10.5 mins) segments.  The Jazz in particular was quite fast-paced, and eventually, I gave up on even trying to follow along.  The 9-minute ballet segment was nice, with traditional ballet moves such as plies, attitudes, passe, and ronde-de-jom.  However, unlike the two toning segments in 10-Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix, this section did not provide any additional aerobic benefit.  Galardi ends with a 4-minute Cool-Down for a total time of 50.5 minutes.In summary, I was somewhat disappointed by this workout.  Although I thought Galardi did a good job, I found the choreography to be significant more complex than in her previous workout that I had tried.  And either because I was struggling to get the moves or for other reasons, I had trouble maintaining my heart rate in my target zone.  So, ultimately this workout was not a good fit for me, but it might work well for someone who is better coordinated and can more easily learn the dance moves.",3,Best suited for someone able to pick up complex choreography,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,2337,"['was', 'interested', 'trying', 'workout', 'really', 'enjoy10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'Fat', 'Blasting', 'Dance', 'Mix', 'also', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', 'What', 'love', 'workout', 'segments', 'are', 'fun', 'easy-to-follow', 'yet', 'definitely', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'was', 'hoping', 'same', 'here', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'following', 'options', 'Warm-Up', 'Hip-Hop', 'Latin', 'Jazz', 'Ballet', 'Cool-Down', 'also', 'Bonus', 'section', 'recipe', 'Health', 'Boosting', 'Smoothie', '5', 'Great', 'Ab', 'Shapers', 'instruction', '5', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'Rev', 'Up', 'Energy', 'tips', 'breath', 'posture', '5', '1/2', 'minute', 'Warm-Up', 'was', 'easy-to-follow', 'moves', 'easy', 'taps', 'V-steps', 'triple', 'steps', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'much', 'raise', 'heart', 'rate', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'segment', 'was', '11', 'minutes', 'long', 'three', 'cardio', 'segments', ""'d"", 'rate', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'Galardi', 'manner', 'similar', 'how', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'video', 'i.e.', 'small', 'piece', 'choreography', 'practice', 'several', 'times', 'then', 'moves', 'next', 'piece', 'gradually', 'adding', 'However', ""n't"", 'too', 'much', 'take', 'top', 'only', 'repeat', 'entire', 'routine', 'few', 'times', 'end.I', 'found', 'choreography', 'Hip', 'Hop', 'segment', 'slightly', 'tricky', 'doable', 'unfortunately', 'however', 'struggled', 'even', 'more', 'Latin', '10.5', 'mins', 'Jazz', '10.5', 'mins', 'segments', 'Jazz', 'particular', 'was', 'quite', 'fast-paced', 'eventually', 'gave', 'up', 'even', 'trying', 'follow', 'along', '9-minute', 'ballet', 'segment', 'was', 'nice', 'traditional', 'ballet', 'moves', 'such', 'plies', 'attitudes', 'passe', 'ronde-de-jom', 'However', 'two', 'toning', 'segments', '10-Minute', 'Solution', 'Fat', 'Blasting', 'Dance', 'Mix', 'section', 'did', 'not', 'provide', 'additional', 'aerobic', 'benefit', 'Galardi', '4-minute', 'Cool-Down', 'total', 'time', '50.5', 'minutes.In', 'summary', 'was', 'somewhat', 'disappointed', 'workout', 'thought', 'Galardi', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'found', 'choreography', 'be', 'significant', 'more', 'complex', 'previous', 'workout', 'had', 'tried', 'either', 'was', 'struggling', 'get', 'moves', 'other', 'reasons', 'had', 'trouble', 'maintaining', 'heart', 'rate', 'target', 'zone', 'So', 'ultimately', 'workout', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'fit', 'might', 'work', 'well', 'someone', 'who', 'better', 'coordinated', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'learn', 'dance', 'moves']",Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!

I have always done only yoga and am very partial to the Gaiam videos, but my New Year's Resolution was to add some cardio work.

I was intrigued because of the ballet exercise segment, which is wonderful, but I found that I enjoy all the dance segments.  The moves are not difficult and the instructor is very easy to understand.  One of the best parts of this video is the bonus section on energy.

So I just skip the ballet section and go directly to the cooldown for 41 minutes total.People with carpet will have a Heck of a time doing some of the movements...especially the latin box moves!  There's lots of twisting movements to prepare to modify (or buy some non-treaded dance shoes, which work like a charm on my low-pile carpet).

I also did not like that after each section the video went back to the main menu so that I had to keep manually programming each section to play; really took me out of my groove and interrupted the flow of my workout.That said, the instructor really is a lot of fun and very sweet and perky (but not in an annoying way as Denise Austin can be).

That is why I gave it 4 stars, despite my frustration with the poor cuing. I find myself having a great time and wanting to do more of the workout each time I use the DVD.I am a dancer and have been doing dance, aerobics, pilates and yoga videos for many years. Nevertheless, it took me a while to get comfortable with this DVD. The fast pace of the workout makes good cuing essential. Unfortunately, Jennifer's cues are often late or unclear. As a result, you have to rely more on your memory from the last time you did the workout, on the rhythm, or on your intuition as a dancer, to help you figure out what comes next.I would not recommend this video for a beginner. I WOULD recommend that intermediate and advanced dancers be prepared to do shorter segments of the video the first few times in order to avoid frustration, or to ""fudge it""  a bit in order to keep pace and stay with the rhythm.Despite this problem, I found myself loving every segment of the DVD-- including the hip hop, which I have never been interested in before. The blend of hip hop, Latin, jazz and ballet means that you are never bored. I also think the ballet segment is a great addition at the end of the DVD because it allows you to elongate your muscles after tightening them up.If you love to dance and have plenty of experience following an instructor, you will find that your patience with this DVD pays off in the end.",4,"a funky workout with lots of challenge, but poor cuing",1197763200,"12 16, 2007",2007,1470,"['choreography', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'challenging', 'why', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'frustration', 'poor', 'cuing', 'find', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'wanting', 'do', 'more', 'workout', 'time', 'use', 'DVD.I', 'am', 'dancer', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'dance', 'aerobics', 'pilates', 'yoga', 'videos', 'many', 'years', 'Nevertheless', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'comfortable', 'DVD', 'fast', 'pace', 'workout', 'good', 'cuing', 'essential', 'Unfortunately', 'Jennifer', 'cues', 'are', 'often', 'late', 'unclear', 'result', 'have', 'rely', 'more', 'memory', 'last', 'time', 'did', 'workout', 'rhythm', 'intuition', 'dancer', 'help', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'next.I', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'video', 'beginner', 'WOULD', 'recommend', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'dancers', 'be', 'prepared', 'do', 'shorter', 'segments', 'video', 'first', 'few', 'times', 'order', 'avoid', 'frustration', 'fudge', 'bit', 'order', 'keep', 'pace', 'stay', 'rhythm.Despite', 'problem', 'found', 'loving', 'segment', 'DVD', 'including', 'hip', 'hop', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'interested', 'before', 'blend', 'hip', 'hop', 'Latin', 'jazz', 'ballet', 'means', 'are', 'never', 'bored', 'also', 'think', 'ballet', 'segment', 'great', 'addition', 'end', 'DVD', 'elongate', 'muscles', 'tightening', 'love', 'dance', 'have', 'plenty', 'experience', 'following', 'instructor', 'will', 'find', 'patience', 'DVD', 'end']",Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!

There are chapter choices & the bonus includes making a smoothie drink, 3 min on posture, etc. for energy & 3 minutes of 5 of the most popular/best ab exercises.The music was aerobic elevator type music, not inspiring at all & also low in volume. Jennifer doesn't show anything in 1/2 time, but she does break down the movements to a simplified foundation & repeated those before repeating the full move. Jennifer does cue very well & the fact she breaks it down is great. She does have a friendly, if toned down personality.The workout's chapters:Intro: 1 minWarm up: 5 min. - basic torso, leg stretches, squats, etc. in increasing speed pace & basic dancingHip Hop: 13 min - basic elementary moves, hip twists, knee swivels, etc. pretty good moves, good ab workLatin Dance: 10 min - a lot of cha chas, locomotion with hands, etc., many moves here felt passeJazz: 10 min - circa 1980s stage dancing, I didn't enjoy it at all & FFW through this portionBallet: 9 min. - though the movements were easy, her execution was very sloppy. She does not guide you about the importance of breath, keeping hips/spine straight & keeping abs tight which is the point of ballet. That is to have better posture, and move more gracefully w/body awareness. You do get a decent toning workout for the lower body & work on balance. The moves themselves are good choices & I liked the pace, but the point of ballet is body awareness, posture & grace which she & the dancers did not have.Cool down: 4 min - The usual movements & stretches overall that you see on most workouts in a slow, relaxed pace.Trailers atcollagevideo comtotalfitnessdvds com",3,"Decent workout for beginners/2 left feet, but moves are passe",1165017600,"12 2, 2006",2006,1740,"['set', 'boring', 'peach/pink', 'glowing', 'lit', 'walls', 'w/a', 'hardwood', 'floor', 'Jennifer', 'Galardi', '4', 'woman', 'behind', 'are', 'chapter', 'choices', 'bonus', 'making', 'smoothie', 'drink', '3', 'min', 'posture', 'etc', 'energy', '3', 'minutes', '5', 'most', 'popular/best', 'ab', 'exercises.The', 'music', 'was', 'aerobic', 'elevator', 'type', 'music', 'not', 'inspiring', 'also', 'low', 'volume', 'Jennifer', ""n't"", 'show', 'anything', '1/2', 'time', 'break', 'down', 'movements', 'simplified', 'foundation', 'repeated', 'repeating', 'full', 'move', 'Jennifer', 'cue', 'very', 'well', 'fact', 'down', 'great', 'have', 'friendly', 'toned', 'down', 'personality.The', 'workout', 'chapters', 'Intro', '1', 'minWarm', 'up', '5', 'min', 'basic', 'torso', 'leg', 'stretches', 'squats', 'etc', 'increasing', 'speed', 'pace', 'basic', 'dancingHip', 'Hop', '13', 'min', 'basic', 'elementary', 'moves', 'hip', 'twists', 'knee', 'swivels', 'etc', 'pretty', 'good', 'moves', 'good', 'ab', 'workLatin', 'Dance', '10', 'min', 'lot', 'cha', 'chas', 'locomotion', 'hands', 'etc.', 'many', 'moves', 'here', 'felt', 'passeJazz', '10', 'min', 'circa', '1980s', 'stage', 'dancing', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'FFW', 'portionBallet', '9', 'min', 'movements', 'were', 'easy', 'execution', 'was', 'very', 'sloppy', 'not', 'guide', 'importance', 'breath', 'keeping', 'hips/spine', 'straight', 'keeping', 'abs', 'tight', 'point', 'ballet', 'have', 'better', 'posture', 'move', 'more', 'gracefully', 'w/body', 'awareness', 'do', 'get', 'decent', 'toning', 'workout', 'lower', 'body', 'work', 'balance', 'moves', 'are', 'good', 'choices', 'liked', 'pace', 'point', 'ballet', 'body', 'awareness', 'posture', 'grace', 'dancers', 'did', 'not', 'have.Cool', 'down', '4', 'min', 'usual', 'movements', 'stretches', 'overall', 'see', 'most', 'workouts', 'slow', 'relaxed', 'pace.Trailers', 'atcollagevideo', 'comtotalfitnessdvds', 'com']",Prevention Fitness Systems - Express Workout: Dance it Off!
