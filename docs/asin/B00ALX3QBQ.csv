1613116,A39H1GO9E3YQIB,B00ALX3QBQ,a,"[0, 1]","I have been a fan of Guy Pearce's film work for quite a while, and I was thrilled to learn that he was starring in a new Australian crime series. This first series includes two feature-length episodes, each one clocking in at around 100 minutes. Pearce's character, Jack Irish, is an occasional lawyer, professional gambler, debt collector, and apprentice cabinetmaker - not officially, as some reviewers have mentioned, a private investigator, despite his abilities. Like most flawed yet likeable hero-detectives, he's been touched by tragedy, drinks heavily, takes risks, and ultimately stands up for what is right and proper. Somehow, he manages to get himself involved in murder mysteries with a surprisingly international scope, involving - at least in these first two outings - corrupt police and/or government officials and their gun-toting henchmen.  In that respect, I found these two mystery movies a bit lacking.I felt that the character of Jack Irish would have been better served with smaller, more manageable local crimes rather than stretching credibility by involving him in huge plots with lots of complicated working parts.  My spouse did not enjoy these two nearly as much as I did, complaining that the plots were overly complex, the pace was slow, and the overall atmosphere was too dreary.  I disagree, to a point.  I enjoyed the 100-minute length and felt the pace was appropriate. It provided ample time to develop an intriguing cast of characters that grow over the course of the two movies. While I admittedly did not follow everything, I appreciated the complexity of the mysteries and the way in which the writer made me think and form connections rather than handing me all the solutions in a neat and tidy epilogue.  I also thought Pearce was wonderful in the lead role.Overall, I would gladly revisit the world and look forward to the eventual creation and release of a second series.  A few tidbits worth noting: although unrated, there's enough violence, nudity, and language to easily earn this an R rating or a place of cable television. There are, thankfully, subtitles which came in quite handy since there's quite a lot of dialogue I had trouble following.  And the only special feature is a 15-minute behind-the-scenes on the making of the second episode.",4,"Two well-made, feature-length episodes",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,2294,"['have', 'been', 'fan', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'film', 'work', 'quite', 'while', 'was', 'thrilled', 'learn', 'was', 'starring', 'new', 'Australian', 'crime', 'series', 'first', 'series', 'two', 'feature-length', 'episodes', 'one', 'clocking', '100', 'minutes', 'Pearce', 'character', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'occasional', 'lawyer', 'professional', 'gambler', 'debt', 'collector', 'apprentice', 'cabinetmaker', 'not', 'officially', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'private', 'investigator', 'abilities', 'most', 'flawed', 'yet', 'likeable', 'hero-detectives', 'been', 'touched', 'tragedy', 'drinks', 'heavily', 'risks', 'ultimately', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'proper', 'Somehow', 'get', 'involved', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'surprisingly', 'international', 'scope', 'involving', 'least', 'first', 'two', 'outings', 'corrupt', 'police', 'and/or', 'government', 'officials', 'gun-toting', 'henchmen', 'respect', 'found', 'two', 'mystery', 'movies', 'bit', 'lacking.I', 'felt', 'character', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'smaller', 'more', 'manageable', 'local', 'crimes', 'rather', 'stretching', 'credibility', 'involving', 'huge', 'plots', 'lots', 'complicated', 'working', 'parts', 'spouse', 'did', 'not', 'enjoy', 'two', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'complaining', 'plots', 'were', 'overly', 'complex', 'pace', 'was', 'slow', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'was', 'too', 'dreary', 'disagree', 'point', 'enjoyed', '100-minute', 'length', 'felt', 'pace', 'was', 'appropriate', 'provided', 'ample', 'time', 'develop', 'intriguing', 'cast', 'characters', 'grow', 'course', 'two', 'movies', 'admittedly', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'everything', 'appreciated', 'complexity', 'mysteries', 'way', 'writer', 'made', 'think', 'form', 'connections', 'rather', 'handing', 'solutions', 'neat', 'tidy', 'epilogue', 'also', 'thought', 'Pearce', 'was', 'wonderful', 'lead', 'role.Overall', 'would', 'gladly', 'revisit', 'world', 'look', 'forward', 'eventual', 'creation', 'release', 'second', 'series', 'A', 'few', 'tidbits', 'worth', 'noting', 'unrated', 'enough', 'violence', 'nudity', 'language', 'easily', 'earn', 'R', 'rating', 'place', 'cable', 'television', 'are', 'thankfully', 'subtitles', 'came', 'quite', 'handy', 'quite', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'had', 'trouble', 'following', 'only', 'special', 'feature', '15-minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'making', 'second', 'episode']",Jack Irish anglais
1613117,A33WFRICMYRPT6,B00ALX3QBQ,"Amazon Customer ""Potius mori quam foedari!""","[1, 3]","""Jack Irish (Set 1)"" contains the first two (""Bad Debts"" & ""Black Tide"") of what will probably be at least a five-movie series.In the end, neither movie is bad, but neither is especially good either. You won't regret spending almost 4 hours watching the movies, but you won't come away feeling that the movies were the best use of the time spent.Guy Pearce is a reputable defense lawyer struggling to put his life back together after the brutal murder of his wife in the opening minutes of the first movie. Both stories focus on Irish helping to take down corrupt government officials and/or unscrupulous capitalists.Being Australian productions, the American viewer faces the predictable problems of the Australian accent, syntax, idiom, and cultural references. None of these issues are insurmountable, but I did find myself using the rewind button more times than I had anticipated I would.I can't be the only movie enthusiast who finds the anti-hero becoming far too frequent, morally repugnant, and more than a bit tiresome (those who are familiar with the Australian production ""Rake"" will find ""Jack Irish"" somewhat similar). I would prefer to see the return of the true hero, but given the unlikelihood of that, at least see the return of the flawed hero (e.g., ""Longmire""). What I dislike about Jack Irish is that we seem to be asked by the producers to forgive Jack's non-too infrequent or insignificant moral failings because in the end his sense of right and wrong help bring down supposedly bigger, more significant problems. Begging the question as to which problems are actually bigger, why does the viewer have to make this choice? Jack Irish is - frankly - stuck in his grief and uses this ""stuckness"" to justify his very questionable moral choices.The acting is pretty good; Marta Dusseldorp is quite good Irish's new romantic interest (or is she?). She is involved in a scene that bears more than a passing resemblance to a Faye Dunaway scene inNetwork.In the end, typical TV fare (especially for what Europe and/or Australia think US viewers want to see from them). Some good moments, but far too many morally questionable issues to rate this offering at more than 3 stars.",3,Jack Irish: The Newest Addition To An Already Over-Crowded And Clich&eacute;d Genre,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",2013,2193,"['Jack', 'Irish', 'Set', '1', 'first', 'two', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'Black', 'Tide', 'what', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'least', 'five-movie', 'series.In', 'end', 'movie', 'bad', 'especially', 'good', 'either', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret', 'spending', 'almost', '4', 'hours', 'watching', 'movies', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'feeling', 'movies', 'were', 'best', 'use', 'time', 'spent.Guy', 'Pearce', 'reputable', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'struggling', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'brutal', 'murder', 'wife', 'opening', 'minutes', 'first', 'movie', 'stories', 'focus', 'Irish', 'helping', 'take', 'down', 'corrupt', 'government', 'officials', 'and/or', 'unscrupulous', 'capitalists.Being', 'Australian', 'productions', 'American', 'viewer', 'predictable', 'problems', 'Australian', 'accent', 'syntax', 'idiom', 'cultural', 'references', 'None', 'issues', 'are', 'insurmountable', 'did', 'find', 'using', 'rewind', 'button', 'more', 'times', 'had', 'anticipated', 'would.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'only', 'movie', 'enthusiast', 'who', 'anti-hero', 'becoming', 'far', 'too', 'frequent', 'morally', 'repugnant', 'more', 'bit', 'tiresome', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'Australian', 'production', 'Rake', 'will', 'find', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'return', 'true', 'hero', 'given', 'unlikelihood', 'least', 'see', 'return', 'flawed', 'hero', 'e.g.', 'Longmire', 'What', 'dislike', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'seem', 'be', 'asked', 'producers', 'forgive', 'Jack', 'non-too', 'infrequent', 'insignificant', 'moral', 'failings', 'end', 'sense', 'right', 'wrong', 'help', 'bring', 'down', 'supposedly', 'bigger', 'more', 'significant', 'problems', 'Begging', 'question', 'problems', 'are', 'actually', 'bigger', 'why', 'viewer', 'have', 'make', 'choice', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'frankly', 'stuck', 'grief', 'stuckness', 'justify', 'very', 'questionable', 'moral', 'choices.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'Marta', 'Dusseldorp', 'quite', 'good', 'Irish', 'new', 'romantic', 'interest', 'involved', 'scene', 'more', 'passing', 'resemblance', 'Faye', 'Dunaway', 'scene', 'inNetwork.In', 'end', 'typical', 'TV', 'fare', 'especially', 'what', 'Europe', 'and/or', 'Australia', 'think', 'US', 'viewers', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'moments', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'morally', 'questionable', 'issues', 'rate', 'offering', 'more', '3', 'stars']",Jack Irish anglais

1613119,A1FH14TQSVDH1X,B00ALX3QBQ,Anthony Sanchez,"[1, 2]","I had not heard about the Jack Irish series in books or movies, but now I am a fan.  I thought this would be a typical shoot-em-up type of movie but this one from ""down under"" happily fooled me. Irish is not the type to carry a gun or even know how to use one (although yes in one scene of desperation he did use one, but his friend laughed at him for how he used it).  When bullied in a men's room, he remains silent.  When told to run during a gunfight, he doesn't need to be told twice.  And the one time he tries to engage in a fight, he is immediately subdued.  Now for many that might not add up to much of a suspense thriller hero.  But what Irish has going for him is the courage of persistence, knowledge of right and intelligence.  And let's face it, most every man does not have the stomach to put a bullet in another man.  So it is nice to have a hero with real human qualities.The movies are adopted from the books, but how loyal they are to the original writing I cannot say.  The characters range from a flatulent, food devouring police officer, a neighborhood bar with aged fans of a rugby team that no longer exists, a smart and strong willed girlfriend, among others.  Unfortunately, one of the movie characters, ""Charlie"", who is a cabinetmaker was played memorably by a now deceased German actor.  I'm wondering if that will mean the end of his character, who was like a father figure to Irish, or will they simply insert a replacement actor.I'm not familiar with Australian TV so I was amazed by the quality of these made for TV movies.  I believe they were produced by an American network, but their style was much superior to what is usually shown on American cable.  They are also very explicit with the sex scenes so if you are watching this movie with your youth, you should now that they would be R-rated for sexual exposure.  The violence is also presented in strong measure, but not by the protagonist.  The only problem that I have for these movies is that I don't ""speak Australian"" and what I mean by that is the accents are strong and I quickly turned to the English subtitles.  Even with the subtitles, I had to guess at some of the vernacular.  This disc came with the first two Irish movies and I hope to see more soon.",5,A realistic hero.,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,2255,"['had', 'not', 'heard', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'series', 'books', 'movies', 'now', 'am', 'fan', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'typical', 'shoot-em-up', 'type', 'movie', 'one', 'down', 'happily', 'fooled', 'Irish', 'not', 'type', 'carry', 'gun', 'even', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'one', 'yes', 'one', 'scene', 'desperation', 'did', 'use', 'one', 'friend', 'laughed', 'how', 'used', 'When', 'bullied', 'men', 'room', 'silent', 'When', 'told', 'run', 'gunfight', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'told', 'twice', 'one', 'time', 'engage', 'fight', 'immediately', 'subdued', 'Now', 'many', 'might', 'not', 'add', 'up', 'much', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'hero', 'what', 'Irish', 'going', 'courage', 'persistence', 'knowledge', 'right', 'intelligence', 'let', 'face', 'most', 'man', 'not', 'have', 'stomach', 'put', 'bullet', 'man', 'nice', 'have', 'hero', 'real', 'human', 'qualities.The', 'movies', 'are', 'adopted', 'books', 'how', 'loyal', 'are', 'original', 'writing', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'characters', 'range', 'flatulent', 'food', 'devouring', 'police', 'officer', 'neighborhood', 'bar', 'aged', 'fans', 'rugby', 'team', 'longer', 'smart', 'strong', 'willed', 'girlfriend', 'others', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'movie', 'characters', 'Charlie', 'who', 'cabinetmaker', 'was', 'played', 'memorably', 'now', 'deceased', 'German', 'actor', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'will', 'mean', 'end', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'father', 'figure', 'Irish', 'will', 'simply', 'insert', 'replacement', 'actor.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'familiar', 'Australian', 'TV', 'was', 'amazed', 'quality', 'made', 'TV', 'movies', 'believe', 'were', 'produced', 'American', 'network', 'style', 'was', 'much', 'superior', 'what', 'usually', 'shown', 'American', 'cable', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'explicit', 'sex', 'scenes', 'so', 'are', 'watching', 'movie', 'youth', 'should', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'R-rated', 'sexual', 'exposure', 'violence', 'also', 'presented', 'strong', 'measure', 'not', 'protagonist', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'Australian', 'what', 'mean', 'accents', 'are', 'strong', 'quickly', 'turned', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Even', 'subtitles', 'had', 'guess', 'vernacular', 'disc', 'came', 'first', 'two', 'Irish', 'movies', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'soon']",Jack Irish anglais
1613120,A30638B9S2GOM8,B00ALX3QBQ,apples2apples,"[2, 3]","Jack Irish played by Guy Pearce, is a fast paced, exciting, Australian TV drama. My husband and I initially watched together and both of us agreed we'd love to see more of this series - which had numerous sub-plots, likable main characters, very unlikable devious minor characters, and others who just rounded out the stories. I watched the DVD two more times by myself, and liked it the 2nd and 3rd times just as much - which is unheard of for me - I'm not much of a repeat customer on DVD's ... occasionally I'll watch something twice, but very rarely three times! This is just a really great series!There's really nothing to compare it to in the U.S. - at least nothing that jumps to mind. I can tell you a little about it, but be forewarned:SPOILER ALERT!As the 1st scene opens, Jack and his beautiful young wife are talking about domestic things, and as they descend the stairs an angry client bursts in through the front door ... yelling about his case, how Jack hadn't listened to him, and he spent all this time in jail because of that. Another man in the office says he's going to call the police, but Jack says not to, and shortly after that hear a shot in the background. Jack rushes out to see what it is, and he sees the client with the gun, starts to try to calm him down, and then realizes his wife has been fatally shot! At which point the client turns the gun on himself and commits suicide!Jack goes from a well-groomed, suit wearing lawyer in the 1st scene, to a handsome yet scruffy, dressed-down P.I. of sorts investigating private matters for people whom he knows ... or knows of, in one way or another - some more dangerous than others. During one of his particularly dangerous cases Jack gets involved with a female journalist. She's very sophisticated, with a dry wit, and a great sense of self assurance. She's no push-over either ... she won't settle for anything less than what she's after - which is a great story, and if there's some great sex and also a relationship along the way, that works too!We also really liked the guys Jack went to the horse track with. They're two kind of salty guys - one short and round - the boss, and the other was tall, dark, slim, with dark wavy hair, and a sparkling smile. When Jack gets into a bind and they're with him,  they're  prepared with the necessary guns and ammo to get by.The main plot involves government level corruption, a cover-up, stalking, chases, and spying. When they find out Jack has his nose in their business, they bring him in to have a talk with him, and it appears Jack can't be bought - although it's obvious he is just a bit scared and rightfully so.",5,"Fast-paced, thrill a minute, more, More, MORE!!!",1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,2644,"['Jack', 'Irish', 'played', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'fast', 'paced', 'exciting', 'Australian', 'TV', 'drama', 'husband', 'initially', 'watched', 'together', 'agreed', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'more', 'series', 'had', 'numerous', 'sub-plots', 'likable', 'main', 'characters', 'very', 'unlikable', 'devious', 'minor', 'characters', 'others', 'who', 'just', 'rounded', 'out', 'stories', 'watched', 'DVD', 'two', 'more', 'times', 'liked', '2nd', '3rd', 'times', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'unheard', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'repeat', 'customer', 'DVD', 'occasionally', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'something', 'twice', 'very', 'rarely', 'three', 'times', 'just', 'really', 'great', 'series', 'really', 'nothing', 'compare', 'U.S.', 'least', 'nothing', 'mind', 'can', 'tell', 'little', 'be', 'forewarned', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', '1st', 'scene', 'opens', 'Jack', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'are', 'talking', 'domestic', 'things', 'descend', 'stairs', 'angry', 'client', 'bursts', 'front', 'door', 'yelling', 'case', 'how', 'Jack', 'had', ""n't"", 'listened', 'spent', 'time', 'jail', 'man', 'office', 'going', 'call', 'police', 'Jack', 'not', 'shortly', 'hear', 'shot', 'background', 'Jack', 'out', 'see', 'what', 'client', 'gun', 'try', 'calm', 'down', 'then', 'realizes', 'wife', 'been', 'fatally', 'shot', 'point', 'client', 'gun', 'commits', 'suicide', 'Jack', 'well-groomed', 'suit', 'wearing', 'lawyer', '1st', 'scene', 'handsome', 'yet', 'scruffy', 'dressed-down', 'P.I', 'sorts', 'investigating', 'private', 'matters', 'people', 'whom', 'knows', 'one', 'way', 'more', 'dangerous', 'others', 'one', 'particularly', 'dangerous', 'cases', 'Jack', 'involved', 'female', 'journalist', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'dry', 'wit', 'great', 'sense', 'self', 'assurance', 'push-over', 'wo', ""n't"", 'settle', 'anything', 'less', 'what', 'great', 'story', 'great', 'sex', 'also', 'relationship', 'way', 'too', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'guys', 'Jack', 'went', 'horse', 'track', ""'re"", 'two', 'kind', 'salty', 'guys', 'one', 'short', 'round', 'boss', 'other', 'was', 'tall', 'dark', 'slim', 'dark', 'wavy', 'hair', 'sparkling', 'smile', 'When', 'Jack', 'bind', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'prepared', 'necessary', 'guns', 'ammo', 'get', 'by.The', 'main', 'plot', 'government', 'level', 'corruption', 'cover-up', 'stalking', 'chases', 'spying', 'When', 'find', 'out', 'Jack', 'nose', 'business', 'bring', 'have', 'talk', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bought', 'obvious', 'just', 'bit', 'scared', 'rightfully', 'so']",Jack Irish anglais

Jack Taylor, who *is* Irish, is a former policeman who now works as a hard drinking, hard boiled private investigator in the working class dock town of Galway, Ireland.  From here, the two stories converge.Jack (either) holds court in the local pub, accepts cases that start simply enough and begin to unfold like petals on a wilting rose.  In t he process, Jack gets to sleep with one or two women, engage in a car chase or two, encounter a few mangled/decaying corpses, and get severely beaten.

My high school football coach had two sayings, ""When you have a play that works, run it to death"" and ""Run, run, pass, kick"".

Everyone knows what to say and the main characters say their likes with appropriate meaning and emphasis,  However, facial expressions frequently don't match what's going on and scenes can carry on long enough to see actors drop character.Both disks have English subtitles available.

1613126,A18S2A07LBNVNF,B00ALX3QBQ,Bucky,"[3, 5]","I wanted to like this more than I did, but in the end, the banality of the stories in the set made it difficult to marshal up more than a lukewarm enthusiasm for this Australian noir series.  Jack Irish is an Australian lawyer whose worldview takes an understandable nose dive when his wife is murdered by a crazed, distraught client.  Abandoning his lucrative practice with a well-heeled law firm, he takes to heavy drinking and hanging out with some rather dodgy characters, including a horse race fixer and his bodyguard/driver/legbreaker, as well as some amusing old-timers with a rabid love of a football team that has moved on to play in another town.  When he's not drinking and helping to fix horse races, Jack does the odd bit of work for former clients and old friends, work that could prevent powerful and ruthless men from making heaps of money in the drug trade and real estate scams.  Naturally, this makes the powerful and ruthless men want to kill Jack and everyone he knows.All this sounds terribly interesting and it should be, except that it's not.  The mysteries themselves manage to be both lackluster and confusing, and I found myself watching not to see how it would all turn out, but for the odd bits of interaction among the side characters who make up Jack's collection of friends: the Fitzroy alte kakkers who hang out at his favorite pub watching 30 year old ball games, the world weary German cabinetmaker who's actually trying to teach Jack how to go on living in the face of life's cruelties, and Cam, the philosophical hired muscle working for the horse race fixer.Although I could understand what was being said fairly well, I turned on the subtitles to get a better grasp on the slang and keep up with the story more easily.  For example, in one story, Jack and Cam go down to &#34;Tassie.&#34;  Seeing the word on the screen instead of having to suss it out made it quicker and easier for me to realize that they were in Tasmania.  You'll also get the correct spelling for various idiomatic words and phrases, which makes it easier to look them up online.This set has its moments, but it wasn't riveting.

He's a nuanced, interesting actor, but at first it really seemed like he'd just mailed in this performance. Maybe he was just being extra-nuanced. Based on the DVD cover and description, I was hoping for something much darker, along the lines of Robson Green'sTouching Evil, and I expected a more grizzled, hard-bitten private eye character, exploring the seamy underside of Australia. Turns out it's about a former lawyer who keeps getting himself in over his head. Not that that's a bad thing.I missed a lot of it on my first viewing because my son felt compelled to bring the house down around me while I tried to watch it, so I came back later when I had some quiet time to myself. I'm glad I did.Sure, Jack Irish is, on the surface, typical of the genre: sad, haunted by his past, scruffy. (I understand it's part of his ""look,"" but it bugged me that Jack couldn't be bothered to take a shower and shave before a big fancy dinner.) Pearce plays Jack almost dully, but that makes his occasional zinger hit harder. Jack himself is sort of a cypher, but he's surrounded by interesting, entertaining characters, including a group of old footballers at the pub who idolized Jack's father; the underused but vastly amusing Aaron Pederson; and the Australian Oliver Platt (Pearce'sThe Hard Wordco-star Damien Richardson). Jack's romantic entanglements are believable; his relationship with his woodworker ""master"" is short on words but big on heart.

Pearce, who hit Hollywood as a live-wire heavy, sets his machismo aside in favor a more cool, self-contained persona. Jack takes danger and menace in his stride -- he doesn't seek out violence but reacts to it with capable efficiency.  He is a calm, self-effacing anti-hero, Melbourne's answer to Philip Marlowe, though a man who saves the wisecracks and humor for his mates, mostly keeping quiet when the bad guys show up.  Pearce's laconic private eye is a unique character: he doesn't seethe or do slow burns, he doesn't act tough or bluster his way past bullies, he just bides his time and moves steadily forward, showing a more low-key style of Australian can-do pragmatism.Set One features the first two episodes of what promises to be a long and rewarding crime series -- the stories &#34;Bad Debts&#34; and &#34;Black Tide,&#34; originally broadcast in 2012. In both episodes he confronts corruption and conspiracy in the upper reaches of the Australian political structure -- the level of peril is a little over-the-top (a little &#34;Hollywood&#34;) but the show is immensely captivating and entertaining nonetheless. Plus, there's plenty of great Aussie slang in here, not overdone, but entertaining, with phrases like &#34;sandgroper&#34; which may be new to American audiences.

Jack Irish is a former prosperous defense lawyer who lost his wife when a past client came to his office to argue about how his case was defended in court. Jack Irish tells his wife to leave the office and head for the car and he will meet her after he and his client talk a bit. Instead, the client follows his wife out to the car, shoots and kills her and then kills himself right in front of Irish.Irish's life goes into a tailspin. Now,he spends his time woodworking, drinking,doing a bit of bill collecting and gambling. But, sometimes the right case comes along and he gets motivated to really care about something that matters again...I was honestly not impressed by Guy Pearce in Iron Man 3, but I thought he hit all of the right notes in his portrayal of Jack Irish. His new (and seedy) friends are there to help as well and there is the alluring promise of new romance for Irish.This DVD contains two 90 minute full-length episodes plus a 17 minute behind-the-scenes bonus feature.This show would be rated R in the United States due to language and nudity.",4,This will be of interest to fans of brooding mysteries,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1155,"['Guy', 'Pearce', 'villain', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'Australian', 'mystery', 'show', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'former', 'prosperous', 'defense', 'lawyer', 'who', 'lost', 'wife', 'when', 'past', 'client', 'came', 'office', 'argue', 'how', 'case', 'was', 'defended', 'court', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'wife', 'leave', 'office', 'head', 'car', 'will', 'meet', 'client', 'talk', 'bit', 'Instead', 'client', 'wife', 'car', 'shoots', 'then', 'right', 'front', 'Irish.Irish', 'life', 'tailspin', 'Now', 'time', 'woodworking', 'drinking', 'doing', 'bit', 'bill', 'collecting', 'gambling', 'sometimes', 'right', 'case', 'along', 'motivated', 'really', 'care', 'something', 'matters', 'again', 'was', 'honestly', 'not', 'impressed', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'thought', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'portrayal', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'new', 'seedy', 'friends', 'are', 'there', 'help', 'as', 'well', 'alluring', 'promise', 'new', 'romance', 'Irish.This', 'DVD', 'two', '90', 'minute', 'full-length', 'episodes', '17', 'minute', 'behind-the-scenes', 'feature.This', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'United', 'States', 'due', 'language', 'nudity']",Jack Irish anglais

The first film, ""Bad Debts"" was riveting from the horrifying opening scene in which Jack Irish, an attorney, is visited by a client who served a prison sentence for unpaid parking tickets (131 of them) coupled an with assault upon a police officer. The client's wife and children left him and he comes to Irish's office to wreak revenge, swiftly doled out by him in the murder of Irish's newlywed bride. The man eats his gun in front of Irish.This has left Irish in a ""state of incoherent rage."" His practice of law becomes non-existent except for one client, Harry Strange, a wealthy racetrack aficionado whose other aide is a darkly handsome man named Cam. He and Cam protect Harry and collect money owed to him by other gamblers.Irish spends a great deal of time with Charlie, an elderly cabinetmaker and expert craftsman, who is a father figure to him. We learn that Irish's father was a sports hero and died when the Irish was a lad.Along the way another former client calls him for help, but Irish is too late in responding and this man too is murdered. There are a series of crimes and Irish meets a newspaper reporter, Linda Hillier, a stunning blond, who is working on municipal corruption expose involving a ""planning"" commission.  Irish assures Linda that he is as ""domesticated as a neutered cat"" although he is rakish and handsome. He has not had any other love interests sine the death of his bride Isabel.Irish conducts his business in a plain Melbourne old-timers local pub peopled by a no nonsense bartender (Stanley) and three elderly rascals who have keen memories about sports and music trivia and are deeply devoted to Fitzroy sports memorabilia which ""decorates"" the pub's walls.The second film, ""Black Tide,"" is an equally engaging story. Linda is now a high profile TV reporter in Sydney. Irish spends a lot of time with Charlie, the craftsman. He is practicing law and lives steps away from his second office, the same pub featured in the first film. Cam is now a trusted ally, Linda is geographically unavailable, and another mystery and more crimes follow.  This story too is just as riveting as the first film on the CD. Altogether, more than 80 exceptional actors are featured in both films. Guy Pearce portrays Irish. The actor, Vadim, who plays the part of Charlie, has died in real-life and there is a tribute to him in the 17 minutes of extra material on the DVD. The two stories are based upon award winning books by Peter Temple.Guy Pearce's Jack Irish is outstanding.",5,Satisfying Sizzling Suspense,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,2625,"['Jack', 'Irish', 'two', 'feature', 'length', 'Australian', 'films', 'one', 'disc', 'watching', 'wanted', 'more', 'more', 'more', 'first', 'film', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'was', 'riveting', 'horrifying', 'opening', 'scene', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'attorney', 'visited', 'client', 'who', 'served', 'prison', 'sentence', 'unpaid', 'parking', 'tickets', '131', 'coupled', 'assault', 'police', 'officer', 'client', 'wife', 'children', 'left', 'Irish', 'office', 'wreak', 'revenge', 'swiftly', 'doled', 'out', 'murder', 'Irish', 'newlywed', 'bride', 'man', 'gun', 'front', 'Irish.This', 'left', 'Irish', 'state', 'incoherent', 'rage', 'practice', 'law', 'non-existent', 'one', 'client', 'Harry', 'Strange', 'wealthy', 'racetrack', 'aficionado', 'other', 'aide', 'darkly', 'handsome', 'man', 'named', 'Cam', 'Cam', 'protect', 'Harry', 'collect', 'money', 'owed', 'other', 'gamblers.Irish', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'Charlie', 'elderly', 'cabinetmaker', 'expert', 'craftsman', 'who', 'father', 'figure', 'learn', 'Irish', 'father', 'was', 'sports', 'hero', 'died', 'when', 'Irish', 'was', 'lad.Along', 'way', 'former', 'client', 'help', 'Irish', 'too', 'late', 'responding', 'man', 'too', 'murdered', 'are', 'series', 'crimes', 'Irish', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Linda', 'Hillier', 'stunning', 'blond', 'who', 'working', 'municipal', 'corruption', 'expose', 'involving', 'planning', 'commission', 'Irish', 'assures', 'Linda', 'domesticated', 'neutered', 'cat', 'rakish', 'handsome', 'not', 'had', 'other', 'love', 'interests', 'sine', 'death', 'bride', 'Isabel.Irish', 'business', 'plain', 'Melbourne', 'old-timers', 'local', 'pub', 'peopled', 'nonsense', 'bartender', 'Stanley', 'three', 'elderly', 'rascals', 'who', 'have', 'keen', 'memories', 'sports', 'music', 'trivia', 'are', 'deeply', 'devoted', 'Fitzroy', 'sports', 'memorabilia', 'decorates', 'pub', 'walls.The', 'second', 'film', 'Black', 'Tide', 'equally', 'engaging', 'story', 'Linda', 'now', 'high', 'profile', 'TV', 'reporter', 'Sydney', 'Irish', 'lot', 'time', 'Charlie', 'craftsman', 'practicing', 'law', 'steps', 'away', 'second', 'office', 'same', 'pub', 'featured', 'first', 'film', 'Cam', 'now', 'trusted', 'ally', 'Linda', 'geographically', 'unavailable', 'mystery', 'more', 'crimes', 'follow', 'story', 'too', 'just', 'as', 'riveting', 'first', 'film', 'CD', 'Altogether', 'more', '80', 'exceptional', 'actors', 'are', 'featured', 'films', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Irish', 'actor', 'Vadim', 'who', 'part', 'Charlie', 'died', 'real-life', 'tribute', '17', 'minutes', 'extra', 'material', 'DVD', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'award', 'winning', 'books', 'Peter', 'Temple.Guy', 'Pearce', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'outstanding']",Jack Irish anglais

Ratcheson,"[1, 2]","As another reviewer pointed out, several of us were offered the chance to review both this Australian series, & a similar British action TV series called Jack Taylor.What they have in common:1. ACTION2. Unfortunately, quality similar to American action television; though Irish is MUCH better than the dreadful Taylor series.3. Both feature protagonists tortured by their past who have somewhat unintentionally become private detectives (Taylor's an ex cop, Irish is an ex attorney)3. Both are distributed by Acorn on USA dvd (along with the wonderful Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries that I reviewed awhile back), & both have excellent picture quality4. Both are expensive (Irish has 2 long episodes, Taylor 3).5. After watching them both, I finally realized what I found the most disturbing; both focus on extreme evil & corruption from those in power: police, government, etc; & both are probably pretty true to real life in that regard. I didn't realize until after watching both that was what was upsetting me the most.The main difference is that while not at the level I'd hoped, the writing for Irish is more intelligent than that for Taylor, & less reflective of today's lowest common denominator mentality in the entertainment industry. I had thought the L.C.D. problem as far as film & TV was mostly American; these shows (especially Taylor, but Irish would fit right in on USA TV also) have proven me wrong.To sum up, if you like USA action television you'll probably like this. If you're looking for a more intelligently written thriller series (& a better value), try the same distributor's also Australian TV seriesMiss Fisher's Murder Mysteries.Also, while the shows are twice as long as USA TV (90-105 minutes + without commercials), this is still a poor value for 2 episodes.",3,Pretty Similar In Quality To USA Action TV,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,1790,"['reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'several', 'were', 'offered', 'chance', 'review', 'Australian', 'series', 'similar', 'British', 'action', 'TV', 'series', 'called', 'Jack', 'Taylor.What', 'have', 'common:1', 'ACTION2', 'Unfortunately', 'quality', 'similar', 'American', 'action', 'television', 'Irish', 'MUCH', 'better', 'dreadful', 'Taylor', 'series.3', 'feature', 'protagonists', 'tortured', 'past', 'who', 'have', 'somewhat', 'unintentionally', 'become', 'private', 'detectives', 'Taylor', 'ex', 'cop', 'Irish', 'ex', 'attorney', '3', 'are', 'distributed', 'Acorn', 'USA', 'dvd', 'wonderful', 'Miss', 'Fisher', 'Murder', 'Mysteries', 'reviewed', 'awhile', 'back', 'have', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality4', 'are', 'expensive', 'Irish', '2', 'long', 'episodes', 'Taylor', '3', '.5', 'watching', 'finally', 'realized', 'what', 'found', 'most', 'disturbing', 'focus', 'extreme', 'evil', 'corruption', 'power', 'police', 'government', 'etc', 'are', 'probably', 'pretty', 'true', 'real', 'life', 'regard', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'watching', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'upsetting', 'most.The', 'main', 'difference', 'not', 'level', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'writing', 'Irish', 'more', 'intelligent', 'Taylor', 'less', 'reflective', 'today', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'mentality', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'had', 'thought', 'L.C.D', 'problem', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'TV', 'was', 'mostly', 'American', 'shows', 'especially', 'Taylor', 'Irish', 'would', 'fit', 'right', 'USA', 'TV', 'also', 'have', 'proven', 'wrong.To', 'sum', 'up', 'like', 'USA', 'action', 'television', ""'ll"", 'probably', ""'re"", 'looking', 'more', 'intelligently', 'written', 'thriller', 'series', 'better', 'value', 'try', 'same', 'distributor', 'also', 'Australian', 'TV', 'seriesMiss', 'Fisher', 'Murder', 'Mysteries.Also', 'shows', 'are', 'twice', 'as', 'long', 'USA', 'TV', '90-105', 'minutes', '+', 'commercials', 'still', 'poor', 'value', '2', 'episodes']",Jack Irish anglais

A criminal lawyer gone rogue as debt collector, drunk, gambler, and more after his wife's murder. Guy Pearce becomes the character that was created from the crime novels of Peter Temple. Those books are being released in America now in parallel with the winning TV series. Even 100 minutes can't do justice to the novel, but the character focus is preserved, as well as the Melbourne setting, also the film location.Some great orchestration and pop music mixed into the episodes.Jack is a fallen, grieving lawyer who investigates dark lives--a series that is Aussie character driven.I loved the touching scenes in the wood shop which included the old cabinet maker Charlie (Vadin Glowna) but alas he died prior to airing of the 2 episodes he acted so honestly through. There are also some great give-n-go moments in the local pub.Bad DebtsAn ex-client turns up dead, so jack falls back into a bit of his old life. Politics, crooked cops, business, and murder for $$$ all become a part of the cleverly woven plot of conspiracy and corruption that get the protagonist, Jack Irish, back into the investigative life he so hoped to avoid. Yet he keeps a hold on his gambling and woodworking apprenticeship during life and death events. A bit of nudity during bed scenes with reporter Linda (Marta Dusseldorp) who wants more than just a news story scoop--oops! Complex suspense to keep you on your seat's edge.Black TideIrish's dad's old friend has a case that might provide him some insight into his own dad's past. The friends son, Gary, is missing along with $$$ belonging to his father. And Jack's cabinetmaker gets involved indirectly. As always there are evil people in high places. Romance takes a back seat, well they're not really seated. Always plenty of action.SUBTITLES are available for not only the 2 feature-length episodes but also the Behind the Scenes film bonus segment. Unrated but with gritty adult content.

The films are based on the award-winning books by Peter Temple.The plots are very enjoyable and suspenseful; Guy Pearce as Jack Irish is charismatic and likeable; his acting is superb; and the actors who play smaller parts add much that is positive to the drama. The problem with the film - but perhaps it is only my family and me - is that we had difficulty understanding the Australian speech. However, once we turned on the English subtitles, we had no problem, and we did not find the subtitles distracting.Irish, the film shows, was an accomplished criminal lawyer whose wife, who he loved very much, is shot dead. He gives up his law practice and sex in the first film, helps in fixing horse-race betting, and over-indulges in alcohol. Just before giving up his law practice, when he began drinking, he lost a case of vehicular manslaughter. Now, sometime later, he feels guilty about his mishandling of the case, and decides to find out who actually killed the woman.

It's gritty and tense, and Jack always has a few days growth of beard.

In the interim, he drinks like it's going out of style, gambles somewhat recklessly, and also rigs horserace odds at the track with a few low-level criminal pals. He also is a regular at the Prince of Prussia pub, where he enjoys the company of a trio of soccer-loving old-timers who were fans of Irish's father, a great player in his time. Otherwise, he's a ghost of what he once was; something of a dead man walking who just doesn't have the sense to accept it.But, as with the first film in the series on this set, ""Bad Debts"", he receives a call from a former client who did time for a hit-and-run murder of a young activist, who eventually ends up shot in an apparent confrontation with the police. Irish isn't bothered by it at first, but he starts to feel guilt because he was an even bigger drunk than he is now when he defended this man. Through the help of a beautiful and intrepid reporter, he starts to dig around his client's death as well as the death of the activist. Their efforts dig up much more dirt then they ever thought possible on some very powerful people, and Irish has to rely on his wits and his friends to make it through this alive.In the second film, ""Black Tide"", Jack starts a search for the wayward son of one of his father's teammates, and again, slowly discovers that he's run afoul of another conspiracy involving some incredibly powerful people. When a friend and father-figure to Jack is hurt, Jack starts taking a very personal interest in this search, as he involves himself with a lovely double-tough photographer, and a daring and determined cop. He also learns a little more about himself as he learns more about his father. And certainly, not everyone and everything is as it seems here as Jack spirals deeper and deeper into the corruption and greed of an international drug trade.Not only are both of these films enormously entertaining, but they are extremely well-made thrillers where the pacing is never forced, the characters and settings are wildly and almost impossibly vivid, and the direction of young Aussie TV director Jeffrey Walker is realistic while also being nicely noirish. Pearce gives probably the best performance of his career since 2000's MEMENTO by giving Irish numerous layers. On one end, he's a lawyer; another end, he's a criminal of sorts; he's a charming rogue with a decidedly dark streak, but he's never unrelatable even if you might find him a little unlikable at times. And while Pearce is very much at the center of these films, it's the characters that populate his world that make it so striking and memorable. There's Linda (Marta Dusseldorp), the whip-smart reporter; there's Harry and Cam (Roy Billing and Aaron Pedersen, respectively), his partners-in-crime; there's Charlie (Vadim Glowna), the cranky and lovable cabinet-maker who Irish apprentices for; there's Barry (Shane Jacobsen), the vulgar cop. Like I stated, the thing that sets this apart from so many other crime dramas is that the characters are so well lived-in that you know every single one of them, but they never just seem like tropes; they seem like real people in real situations.While the mysteries are a little convoluted, and the endings are a tad on the absurd side, it never gets too dark to really enjoy the ride. There's never really a very down moment, aside from some pretty dark moments that are brief. I would be remiss, though, if I thought that these films might have benefitted and had a little more substance if there were moments where it challenged the audience with some darker elements, but that's not the fault of the film.Admittedly, I did have to watch this with the captioning on because there's a LOT of Aussie slang used here, and the accents are hard to understand at times, but that didn't hinder my great enjoyment of these two films.JACK IRISH is a terrific piece of entertainment that would please many audiences who are getting a little fed up with the dullness of the procedural crime dramas that litter American television. It shows that mysteries can still be fun without the melodrama, and they can still be suspenseful without the relentless darkness and despair.",5,"Great performances, vivid characters and sparkling dialogue make JACK IRISH a great watch.",1384128000,"11 11, 2013",2013,4613,"['tropes', 'private', 'detective', 'novel', 'are', 'great', 'usually', 'greater', 'when', 'tropes', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'much', 'case', 'great', 'Austrailian', 'series', 'JACK', 'IRISH', 'based', 'books', 'Peter', 'Temple', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'fantastic', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'former', 'moderately', 'successful', 'defense', 'attorney', 'Melbourne', 'who', 'ten', 'years', 'prior', 'events', 'make', 'up', 'bulk', 'stories', 'here', 'wife', 'murdered', 'extremely', 'desperate', 'client', 'interim', 'going', 'style', 'somewhat', 'recklessly', 'also', 'rigs', 'horserace', 'odds', 'track', 'few', 'low-level', 'criminal', 'pals', 'also', 'regular', 'Prince', 'Prussia', 'pub', 'where', 'company', 'trio', 'soccer-loving', 'old-timers', 'who', 'were', 'fans', 'Irish', 'father', 'great', 'player', 'time', 'Otherwise', 'ghost', 'what', 'once', 'was', 'something', 'dead', 'man', 'walking', 'who', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'sense', 'accept', 'it.But', 'first', 'film', 'series', 'set', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'call', 'former', 'client', 'who', 'did', 'time', 'hit-and-run', 'murder', 'young', 'activist', 'who', 'eventually', 'up', 'shot', 'apparent', 'confrontation', 'police', 'Irish', ""n't"", 'bothered', 'first', 'feel', 'guilt', 'was', 'even', 'bigger', 'drunk', 'now', 'when', 'defended', 'man', 'help', 'beautiful', 'intrepid', 'reporter', 'dig', 'around', 'client', 'death', 'as', 'well', 'death', 'activist', 'efforts', 'dig', 'up', 'much', 'more', 'dirt', 'then', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible', 'very', 'powerful', 'people', 'Irish', 'rely', 'wits', 'friends', 'make', 'second', 'film', 'Black', 'Tide', 'Jack', 'search', 'wayward', 'son', 'one', 'father', 'teammates', 'again', 'slowly', 'run', 'afoul', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'incredibly', 'powerful', 'people', 'When', 'friend', 'father-figure', 'Jack', 'hurt', 'Jack', 'taking', 'very', 'personal', 'interest', 'search', 'lovely', 'double-tough', 'photographer', 'daring', 'determined', 'cop', 'also', 'little', 'more', 'about', 'more', 'father', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'everything', 'here', 'Jack', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'corruption', 'greed', 'international', 'drug', 'only', 'are', 'films', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'are', 'extremely', 'well-made', 'thrillers', 'where', 'pacing', 'never', 'forced', 'characters', 'settings', 'are', 'wildly', 'almost', 'impossibly', 'vivid', 'direction', 'young', 'Aussie', 'TV', 'director', 'Jeffrey', 'Walker', 'realistic', 'also', 'being', 'nicely', 'noirish', 'Pearce', 'probably', 'best', 'performance', 'career', '2000', 'MEMENTO', 'giving', 'Irish', 'numerous', 'layers', 'one', 'end', 'lawyer', 'end', 'criminal', 'sorts', 'charming', 'rogue', 'decidedly', 'dark', 'streak', 'never', 'unrelatable', 'even', 'might', 'find', 'little', 'unlikable', 'times', 'Pearce', 'very', 'much', 'center', 'films', 'characters', 'populate', 'world', 'make', 'striking', 'memorable', 'Linda', 'Marta', 'Dusseldorp', 'whip-smart', 'reporter', 'Harry', 'Cam', 'Roy', 'Billing', 'Aaron', 'Pedersen', 'respectively', 'partners-in-crime', 'Charlie', 'Vadim', 'Glowna', 'cranky', 'lovable', 'cabinet-maker', 'who', 'apprentices', 'Barry', 'Shane', 'Jacobsen', 'vulgar', 'cop', 'stated', 'thing', 'apart', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'crime', 'dramas', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'well', 'lived-in', 'know', 'single', 'one', 'never', 'just', 'seem', 'tropes', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'situations.While', 'mysteries', 'are', 'little', 'convoluted', 'endings', 'are', 'tad', 'absurd', 'side', 'never', 'too', 'dark', 'really', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'never', 'really', 'very', 'down', 'moment', 'aside', 'pretty', 'dark', 'moments', 'are', 'brief', 'would', 'be', 'remiss', 'though', 'thought', 'films', 'might', 'have', 'benefitted', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'were', 'moments', 'where', 'challenged', 'audience', 'darker', 'elements', 'not', 'fault', 'film.Admittedly', 'did', 'have', 'watch', 'captioning', 'LOT', 'Aussie', 'slang', 'used', 'here', 'accents', 'are', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'hinder', 'great', 'enjoyment', 'two', 'films.JACK', 'IRISH', 'terrific', 'piece', 'entertainment', 'would', 'please', 'many', 'audiences', 'who', 'are', 'getting', 'little', 'fed', 'up', 'dullness', 'procedural', 'crime', 'dramas', 'litter', 'American', 'television', 'mysteries', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'fun', 'melodrama', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'suspenseful', 'relentless', 'darkness', 'despair']",Jack Irish anglais

1613149,A244CRJ2QSVLZ4,B00ALX3QBQ,J. B. Hoyos,"[0, 1]","I seldom watch television because I am too busy reading mysteries.  My favorite ones are those that are set in foreign countries.  I've read several of Garry Disher's Wyatt Wareen mysteries, which are set in Australia.  Having seen Acorn's production of ""Jack Irish,"" I may have to start watching television again.  It appears that the cable network Acorn airs numerous mysteries that are set in Australia and Europe.  ""Jack Irish"" is just one of many.Set 1 contains two episodes of Jack Irish that are approximately ninety minutes long.  It appears that only two episodes have been filmed.  Both are based on Peter Temple's best-selling Jack Irish novels, ""Bad Debts"" and ""Black Tide.""  According to the interesting commentary, the episodes were filmed on location in Australia and follow the novels as close as possible.  There is an outstanding cast of professionals that total approximately 80.  Superstar Guy Pearce (""Lockout,"" ""Lawless,"" ""Memento,"" ""Ravenous"" and ""L. A. Confidential"") heads the cast as Jack Irish, a former Melbourne lawyer who is now an alcoholic, gambling PI who kindly befriends the elderly.Thank goodness the DVD has subtitles.  Even with subtitles, I sometimes found it difficult to understand what these fast-talking Aussies were saying.  Their accents are very thick.  Furthermore, the weather is gloomy and dark.  It often rains during many of the scenes.  This adds to the gloomy atmosphere of these wonderful works of Australian noir.  Speaking of noir, both features have extreme violence; gruesome gore; complex, intricate plots; and attractive women who are hungry for romance.  Both episodes have cursing and nudity; therefore, you may want to think twice before allowing your children to watch them.I feel that Acorn made ""Jack Irish,"" Set 1 for people like me who love foreign mysteries but don't have the time to read them all.  Turning Peter Temple's novels into feature length films was an excellent and wise choice.  What makes these films different from others is the likeability and complexity of Jack Irish's character.  I feel bad for him because his wife was murdered in the parking lot of his business.  I admire his intellect and kind heart.  Hopefully, Acorn will produce future episodes in this series.  I will definitely purchase them.Joseph B.

1613150,A1O97WKID9L3IA,B00ALX3QBQ,"Jeff Wignall ""Photographer, Author and Radio ...","[0, 1]","Until I watched these two movies, I'd never heard of Guy Pearce before--I guess I'm just not great at remembering actors names--but he does look familiar. I will say now, however, I'm a big fan of his acting--he does a superb job in carrying (mostly on the back of his very likable character) a rather complex and convoluted plot.The set contains two roughly 90-minute films. The first, ""Bad Debts,"" introduces the lead character and kind of (and not very well) sets up the backstory. The opening scene (and I won't describe it because it will take away some of the initial drama) shows Jack Irish as a successful criminal lawyer who gives up his career to become something of a lowlife debt collector and general underworld errand boy. The writers did a horrid job of explaining *why* the bad thing that happens to Jack would lead him to give up his law career and I kept thinking they'd get back to that, but they never did. (Don't let this make you think I didn't like the film, I did.) Next an old client of Jack's, and one whose life he helped mess up not just once but twice, is killed after leaving Jack some tense phone messages.Somehow that incident devolves (and that's the only correct word to describe the plot) into a complex plot involving political and police corruption, old friends, etc. The whole story suddenly gets very convoluted and I found it quite hard to follow. What makes things worse, as another reviewer mentioned, is that some of the actors need voice-acting lessons (I work as a voice actor part time, so they can call me for coaching!): you can barely understand a thing they say. Now, I'll admit that my TV does not have great speakers, but I found myself hitting the rewind button dozens of times to understand what the heck they were saying! And no, I'm *not* turning on the subtitles for people that are supposed to be speaking English! Hey, I grew up in a Brit family and I had no trouble understanding anyone (at least until the Scotch was poured--and yes, that's a joke). Really, I know the Australian accent and some of the phrasing can be a tough road at times, but these guys are one millimeter above mumbling. Blame this on the director: it's his job to make sure that the actors are intelligible. (And also, while I don't oppose sex scenes in movies, the scene in this one was dull, dull, dull.)OK, the second film is pretty much more of the same. The son of an old family friend disappears (along with some cash) and Jack is put on the case. More of his personal backstory is revealed (his relationship with his father primarily) and you get to see more of Jack's relationship with a cabinet maker for whom he works (he's really an apprentice). I'm not sure if it's ever explained why Jack is working for the cabinet maker other than the fact that he gave up being a successful lawyer.OK, so, with all those negative things aid, why am I giving this set four stars? Because Guy Pearce does something amazing: he makes a relatively undeveloped character (in terms of writing) impossible not to watch. This is one great actor and one very, very likable character. Plus, I have to say, I *love* seeing Australia up close and I love seeing the gritty sides of places like Sidney. This is the first drama I've ever seen that shows what it's like to live in urban Australia (this is not the Australia inThe Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert (Extra Frills Edition)which, by the way, is a fantastic movie. This is kind of like Australia meets Manhattan's lower east side. Very gritty, very real--so much fun to watch.Overall, the acting and the settings won me over and, believe it or not, I rewatched Bad Debts a second time the very next night.  So, while the writing needs help and the actors need a dialog coach (badly), I had a great deal of fun watching these movies. Yes, there are gaps in the plot, yes they are slow here and there, but overall, lots of action, lots of fun and one great lead character.",4,"Intensely likable lead character, but less than stellar plots",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,3958,"['watched', 'two', 'movies', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'great', 'remembering', 'actors', 'names', 'look', 'familiar', 'will', 'say', 'now', 'however', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'acting', 'superb', 'job', 'carrying', 'mostly', 'back', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'rather', 'complex', 'convoluted', 'plot.The', 'set', 'two', 'roughly', '90-minute', 'films', 'first', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'lead', 'character', 'kind', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'up', 'backstory', 'opening', 'scene', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'will', 'take', 'away', 'initial', 'drama', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'successful', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'who', 'up', 'career', 'become', 'something', 'lowlife', 'debt', 'collector', 'general', 'underworld', 'errand', 'boy', 'writers', 'did', 'horrid', 'job', 'explaining', 'bad', 'thing', 'Jack', 'would', 'lead', 'give', 'up', 'law', 'career', 'kept', 'thinking', ""'d"", 'get', 'back', 'never', 'did', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'make', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'did', 'old', 'client', 'Jack', 'one', 'life', 'helped', 'mess', 'up', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'twice', 'killed', 'leaving', 'Jack', 'tense', 'phone', 'messages.Somehow', 'incident', 'devolves', 'only', 'correct', 'word', 'describe', 'plot', 'complex', 'plot', 'involving', 'political', 'police', 'corruption', 'old', 'friends', 'etc', 'whole', 'story', 'suddenly', 'very', 'convoluted', 'found', 'quite', 'hard', 'follow', 'What', 'things', 'worse', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'actors', 'need', 'voice-acting', 'lessons', 'work', 'voice', 'part', 'time', 'can', 'call', 'coaching', 'can', 'barely', 'understand', 'thing', 'say', 'Now', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'TV', 'not', 'have', 'great', 'speakers', 'found', 'hitting', 'rewind', 'button', 'dozens', 'times', 'understand', 'what', 'heck', 'were', 'saying', ""'m"", '*not*', 'turning', 'subtitles', 'people', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'speaking', 'English', 'Hey', 'grew', 'up', 'Brit', 'family', 'had', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'anyone', 'least', 'Scotch', 'was', 'poured', 'yes', 'joke', 'Really', 'know', 'Australian', 'accent', 'phrasing', 'can', 'be', 'tough', 'road', 'times', 'guys', 'are', 'one', 'millimeter', 'mumbling', 'Blame', 'director', 'job', 'make', 'sure', 'actors', 'are', 'intelligible', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'oppose', 'sex', 'scenes', 'movies', 'scene', 'one', 'was', 'dull', 'dull', 'dull', 'OK', 'second', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'more', 'same', 'son', 'old', 'family', 'friend', 'cash', 'Jack', 'put', 'case', 'More', 'personal', 'backstory', 'revealed', 'relationship', 'father', 'primarily', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Jack', 'relationship', 'cabinet', 'maker', 'whom', 'really', 'apprentice', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'explained', 'why', 'Jack', 'working', 'cabinet', 'maker', 'other', 'fact', 'gave', 'up', 'being', 'successful', 'lawyer.OK', 'so', 'negative', 'things', 'aid', 'why', 'am', 'giving', 'set', 'four', 'stars', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'something', 'amazing', 'relatively', 'undeveloped', 'character', 'terms', 'writing', 'impossible', 'not', 'watch', 'one', 'great', 'actor', 'one', 'very', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'have', 'say', '*love*', 'seeing', 'Australia', 'up', 'close', 'love', 'seeing', 'gritty', 'sides', 'places', 'Sidney', 'first', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'what', 'live', 'urban', 'Australia', 'not', 'Australia', 'inThe', 'Adventures', 'Priscilla', 'Queen', 'Desert', 'Extra', 'Frills', 'Edition', 'way', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'kind', 'Australia', 'Manhattan', 'lower', 'east', 'side', 'Very', 'gritty', 'very', 'real', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch.Overall', 'acting', 'settings', 'won', 'believe', 'not', 'rewatched', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'second', 'time', 'very', 'next', 'night', 'So', 'writing', 'help', 'actors', 'need', 'dialog', 'coach', 'badly', 'had', 'great', 'deal', 'fun', 'watching', 'movies', 'Yes', 'are', 'gaps', 'plot', 'yes', 'are', 'slow', 'here', 'there', 'overall', 'lots', 'action', 'lots', 'fun', 'one', 'great', 'lead', 'character']",Jack Irish anglais
1613151,A23ZNGL704AW7O,B00ALX3QBQ,Jennifer Ray,"[5, 10]","This DVD set has two movies on it, `Bad Debts' and its sequel, `Black Tide', both of which originally aired on Australian TV in October 2012. They star the same leading character, Jack Irish, played by the talented Guy Pearce.BAD DEBTSThis one starts off with a bang, leaving the viewer to expect a fast-paced drama, but then it slows down considerably. Although the beginning made me immediately interested in the character of Jack Irish, the actual plot is somewhat elusive. Tragedy compels Irish to leave a seemingly successful career as a criminal attorney for a less stable life as a private investigator and debt collector. A former legal client leaves Jack a series of desperate messages but is murdered before Jack returns the calls. Guilt combined with a need for justice leads Irish to use his PI skills to investigate the murder, until he finds himself deeply entangled in a conspiracy implicating some very powerful and dangerous people.Several of the male supporting actors were very hard to understand, making it more difficult to follow the plot. I had no problem understanding Guy Pearce or any of the actresses, but that helped only a little. I did very much enjoy Pearce's performance, but of course it takes more than one man to make a good movie. His character, much like the actor himself, is immensely likable and sympathetic, which is the main reason I was even interested in watching the second movie on this DVD.I will admit that `Bad Debts' failed to hold my attention like it should. I think some of that was due to the inability to understand some of the male actors' speech, but a lot of it was due to the very slow pacing throughout most of the movie. The opening scene was the most frenetic, and while one might argue that the pacing emulates Jack Irish's life, it left me with a feeling of tedium at the necessity to finish this movie.BLACK TIDEBlack Tide is the second movie in the series and I have to say that I found this plot even harder to follow. Once again, it was so dull I had a hard time paying attention to it - I honestly wouldn't have even tried to watch it if I weren't obligated to review it. As in the first movie, I had trouble understanding some of the male actors - it's as though they are speaking with a mouth full of marbles. I had no trouble understanding the actors that didn't mumble, like Guy Pearce and all of the female actors, but I feel as if I missed some important details having not understood so much of the dialogue.I really wanted to love these movies - the descriptions sounded like something that would suite me and I really like Guy Pearce's work - normally.

Of the two, I think Bad Debts was the better offering.  The protagonist is a washed up criminal lawyer that had his perfect world collapse in the blink of an eye.  When we meet up with him next, it's months later and he's hit rock bottom.  With the help of a lovely reporter, he starts to pick himself back up.  The female lead does a nice job in the first movie.  In the second, she's kind of under utilized.  There's two more books in the series and I would watch adaptations with this cast of characters again.  Guy Pearce's acting skills were on display here (much better than he was in Iron Man 3, but Rober Downey, Jr seems to have a way of pushing other actors and actresses out of the scenes).  Pearce's performance is moody and brooding.  Irish hangs out with small time criminals, slightly crooked cops, his former legal partner, fans of his father's professional sports days, and his carpenter zen mentor.  It's an odd and surly cast of characters and it works well on screen.Black Tide picks up a few months after Bad Debts ends and once more Jack is embroiled in a twisted world of political schemes and even dirtier cops.I recommend this series.",4,Excellent Noir-style detective series,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,1293,"['part', 'participation', 'Amazon', 'Vines', 'Program', 'received', 'product', 'review.I', 'enjoyed', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'Black', 'Tide', 'two', 'think', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'was', 'better', 'offering', 'protagonist', 'washed', 'up', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'had', 'perfect', 'world', 'collapse', 'blink', 'eye', 'When', 'meet', 'up', 'next', 'months', 'later', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'help', 'lovely', 'reporter', 'pick', 'back', 'up', 'female', 'lead', 'nice', 'job', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'kind', 'utilized', 'two', 'more', 'books', 'series', 'would', 'watch', 'adaptations', 'cast', 'characters', 'again', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'acting', 'skills', 'were', 'display', 'here', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Rober', 'Downey', 'Jr', 'have', 'way', 'pushing', 'other', 'actors', 'scenes', 'Pearce', 'performance', 'moody', 'brooding', 'Irish', 'hangs', 'out', 'small', 'time', 'criminals', 'slightly', 'crooked', 'cops', 'former', 'legal', 'partner', 'fans', 'father', 'professional', 'sports', 'days', 'carpenter', 'zen', 'mentor', 'odd', 'surly', 'cast', 'characters', 'well', 'screen.Black', 'Tide', 'up', 'few', 'months', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'once', 'more', 'Jack', 'embroiled', 'twisted', 'world', 'political', 'schemes', 'even', 'dirtier', 'cops.I', 'recommend', 'series']",Jack Irish anglais
1613154,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B00ALX3QBQ,Jody,"[1, 2]","From the first horrific scene, Bad Debt takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride with Jack Irish.  Jack used to be an attorney, until one of his clients kind of crossed the line.  Now, a former client's calls to Jack for help went unanswered and the client shows up dead.  Despite the Police Commissioner's claims to the contrary, Jack knows the client was clean. and flawed, Jack and his boyish grin get the girl, get the criminals and solve the case.Based on a popular book series, the producers tried to stay faithful to the novels.  There is a large, very large, cast of characters; something like 40 in the first movie alone.  It can get confusing, as ca the sometimes incomprehensible Aussie accents.  Fortunately, Acorn provides a scene by scene option, as well as subtitles, though some of the ironic humor is lost.I didn't like the second movie as much as the first.  Jack's bad luck with women got a little dreary, and the aforementioned women's pleas for understanding were a bit tedious,  &#34;I didn't mean it, Jack!&#34;  They whine.  I like romance as much as the next chick, but this wasn't very romance-y.  The strong woman partner Jack had in Linda, a feisty reporter in Bad Debt, really fizzled in the second movie, and I was very disappointed.For those accustomed to the sanitized and pretty U.S. TV,  and those easily offended, there's nudity, fairly explicit sex, and very strong language in these movies.  The corpses look like corpses.  That's all I'm saying.I really enjoy detective stories set in other cultures.  Jack Irish does justice to the Australian landscape, interiors,  and brashness.

1613155,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00ALX3QBQ,Jon Wynne,"[0, 2]","Guy Pearce is an English-born Australian movie star of considerable international appeal and regard. His father, a test pilot, died when Pearce was nine years old. This made Guy very close to his mother, and with the inherent responsibilities of helping her run a deer farm and the opportunity to attend private school in Australia, Guy found the perfect outlet for his experiences and natural talent as part of the Geelong College Junior Drama Players. He also participated in bodybuilding (winning Junior Mr Victoria&#8211;Victoria, Australia being the city where he lived since the age of three) and fencing; both sports that require discipline and focus. His first big acting gig came at the age of 17, and soon he was appearing in Australian TV shows and films.And, like any actor who has &#8220;made it&#8221; in the world market, Pearce likes to do Australian projects when they come up. JACK IRISH is such an endeavour.Based on the books by Peter Temple, the source material fits Pearce to a T. Part thriller, part redemption story, these first two episodes have a definite film noir feel at times. Characterizations are particulary effective, from the old boys in Irish&#8217;s local pub, to one of his contacts on the police force who is constantly eating junk food, to the sexy journalist he meets who just might help him to heal from the murder of his his beloved wife, to his &#8220;business associates&#8221; who stand with him when the going gets tough. One particularly effective performance comes from German character actor Vadim Glowna, who died shortly after the second episode was filmed. Acting as mentor of sorts to Jack, his Charlie Taub is a furniture maker who allows Jack to be his apprentice. From Charlie, Jack learns patience, craftsmanship and basically how to relax. It&#8217;s without a doubt a form of therapy for Jack and appears to be working. This is one of the stand out features of JACK IRISH; yes, he&#8217;s been through hell and has suffered accordingly, but we see him slowly beginning to make progress out of the pit of despair. Sometimes with these &#8220;burnt out cop&#8221; type of shows, nothing can extradite the hero from his flaws and that can be a little bit tiresome. Not so with Jack. He makes a little bit of progress each episode (presumably with more to come in the anticipated next set of cases). This makes Jack easy to root for, even though he has made some self-destructive (though understandable) choices.There&#8217;s a lot of bad language throughout, and some pretty racy sex, both of which are not necessary. We&#8217;re not in Disneyland, true, but it does remind of the old question, just what, exactly, is entertainment? We can enjoy MIDSOMER MURDERS, GEORGE GENTLY and POIROT and others without being subjected to such things which might turn off some viewers. It&#8217;s always worth mentioning in reviews that certain content may not appeal. Having said that, there is far more to enjoy in JACK IRISH than there is to condemn.For those who welcome JACK IRISH as the latest in Acorn Media&#8217;s phenomenal output of great television, there are two more JACK IRISH books currently being adapted for production, and a fifth novel in the works.And judging from the great behind the scenes featurette, Guy Pearce wants to continue.

Years later, he's left the job and set out to do things to help his buddies and manage to do a little gambling, drinking, and stir up some trouble.  In Bad Debts, Irish gets sucked into an old case from right after his wife's death and feels he needs to set things right.  What he uncovers is a whole heap of trouble that only goes further up the food chain the more he and a reporter find.  In Black Tide, Irish is visited from a friend of his father's who would like to create a will because he doesn't want to leave anything to his son.  But the son is missing and soon enough, Irish is up to his neck in shady dealings and conspiracy once again.Guy Pierce is moody, broody, and attractive enough to pull off the part of Irish.  He doesn't so much radiate as scintillate at times, and he seems to just sort of tumble into events at times.  There's not a lot of detecting, but he is following clues.  Both episodes are slow building which adds to the suspense at times but also seems to make the unraveling of events feel dragged out at times.  The cast of surrounding characters really support the main story and provide a little more color and interest in both episodes.

He's turned into a mean drunk who takes menial jobs and gambles recklessly. But unlike typical noir thriller antiheroes, Jack can't commit wholly to his own implosion. He maintains his posh digs, apprentices to a grizzled master woodworker, and continues seeking meaning. And when his old clients' problems recur, his ethic demands he intervene, at any cost.Of the many recent noir crimebusters who've cluttered TV screens worldwide, this Australian everyman may be the most human. Rather than wallowing in Raymond Chandler-ish self-destruction, Jack Irish is a man in constant struggle. He retains idealistic attachments to standards of justice and loyalty. He defends his clients long after their convictions withstand scrutiny. And he keeps finding himself holding information that jeopardizes the old-boy network.In the first feature-length episode, a client just sprung from prison has evidence of his own set-up, but Jack, drunk and playing the ponies, misses the message until after his client's murder. Realizing he's failed his client twice, he starts digging, but discovers secrets he can't rebury. The second episode features Jack, returned to law, trying to close a family friend's will, only to find his client's son neck-deep in old conspiracies and treachery.Unlike the common dark construction of similar series, this one eschews grey filters and smoky midnights, preferring sunlit Australian daytime, light so bright it bleaches color from everything. Despite occasional Dutch angles at climactic moments, these episodes are mostly overbright, militantly vertical, driven by right angles. It creates an image of brightness and rectitude as oppressive instruments, making our disheveled protagonist a bulwark against his sharp-suited, highly placed foes.Jack Irish, both the man and the series, simultaneously utilize familiar noir movie conventions, and upend those conventions.

His best friends bet on horse races, and lose. The habits of this alcoholic are the antithesis of healthy, but mostly, he's depressed. Really depressed. Now, this is all completely understandable because his beautiful beloved wife has been murdered and he is devastated, but the first episode, ""Bad Debts,"" is just too depressing. It is an excellent mystery, but it is hard to care about any of the characters because you don't know them very well from the outset, so they seem like sad losers. Note: If you cringed at the murdered wife bit, so did I. Another one? Some plot tricks need a rest, right?That said, if you like TV dramas from the UK, you should give this one a chance. I suggest that you start with the second episode, ""Black Tide."" It gives more of Jack's back story and is quite moving. Once you get to know and like Jack, you will enjoy the first episode more. (If you already know Jack from the books, this is not a problem, of course.)The episodes are not rated, but, be assured, they are for adults, at least here in the States.1.The Australian vernacular is thick and takes patience to get used to.2.

1613170,AT0E6UBVJMJ6W,B00ALX3QBQ,Ms Winston,"[1, 2]","I am unfamiliar with the works of Australian author Peter Temple, and so the character of ""Jack Irish"" is a new one for me. This DVD set includes two full length dramas -- ""Bad Debts"" and ""Black Tide"" -- which serve to introduce us to Jack Irish. The first episode opens with a shocking murder and suicide. Within less than 10 minutes from the opening credits, lawyer Irish's beautiful wife has been gunned down by a former client who then turns the gun upon himself. Close to a decade then passes in a few seconds, where we are to understand that Irish has stopped practicing law, has been hitting the bottle fairly hard, and has been befriended by an elderly German cabinet maker who is teaching him the trade. Irish frequents a pub which seems to only have a handful of customers, mainly three ancient sports fans who idolize Irish's long deceased father, a professional athlete. Irish also has a connection to a professional gambler and his driver, and several scenes take place at race courses, where bettors lose thousands of pounds on fixed races.Both ""Bad Debts"" and ""Black Tide"" involve corruption in government and local real estate deals. Each is a self-contained story, but there are regular  characters, including a police officer who is a compulsive eater, who make it out alive from ""Bad Debts"" and carry over to ""Black Water."" After a decade of apparently living like a monk, Irish meets a reporter (Marta Dusseldorp) who looks very much like his late wife and they soon tumble into bed. The actual plots of the two movies are not as important as the character of Jack Irish and how he is attempting to redeem himself after his lost decade. Guy Pearce is a very appealing actor -- the viewer immediately is drawn into his world and is on his side. He is of the scruffy school in his hair style, casual dress and facial stubble, but just like the character of Boyd Crowder in ""Justified"" some women are drawn to that look. It is very much worth noting that the captioning is a feature one may need to use in viewing this series. After watching for several confused minutes, I went back to the beginning and turned on the subtitles --- ""oh, that's what they were saying"" was my immediate reaction. Pearce is easy to understand, but the conversations with the gambler and others in the case are difficult to follow without the subtitles unless you are very familiar with Aussie accents. The exteriors appear to have been shot on location in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as the surrounding rural areas. Very entertaining series -- I am looking forward to Set 2 at some future date.",4,"Remember to Use the Captioning Function and You Will Be Fine, Mate!",1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,2594,"['am', 'unfamiliar', 'works', 'Australian', 'author', 'Peter', 'Temple', 'so', 'character', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'new', 'one', 'DVD', 'set', 'two', 'full', 'length', 'dramas', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'Black', 'Tide', 'serve', 'introduce', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'first', 'episode', 'shocking', 'murder', 'suicide', 'less', '10', 'minutes', 'opening', 'credits', 'lawyer', 'Irish', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'been', 'gunned', 'down', 'former', 'client', 'who', 'then', 'gun', 'Close', 'decade', 'then', 'few', 'seconds', 'where', 'are', 'understand', 'Irish', 'stopped', 'practicing', 'law', 'been', 'hitting', 'bottle', 'fairly', 'hard', 'been', 'befriended', 'elderly', 'German', 'cabinet', 'maker', 'who', 'teaching', 'trade', 'Irish', 'frequents', 'pub', 'only', 'have', 'handful', 'customers', 'mainly', 'three', 'ancient', 'sports', 'fans', 'who', 'idolize', 'Irish', 'long', 'deceased', 'father', 'professional', 'athlete', 'Irish', 'also', 'connection', 'professional', 'gambler', 'driver', 'several', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'race', 'courses', 'where', 'bettors', 'lose', 'thousands', 'pounds', 'fixed', 'races.Both', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'Black', 'Tide', 'involve', 'corruption', 'government', 'local', 'real', 'estate', 'deals', 'self-contained', 'story', 'are', 'regular', 'characters', 'including', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'compulsive', 'eater', 'who', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'carry', 'Black', 'Water', 'decade', 'apparently', 'living', 'monk', 'Irish', 'reporter', 'Marta', 'Dusseldorp', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'late', 'wife', 'soon', 'tumble', 'bed', 'actual', 'plots', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'character', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'how', 'attempting', 'redeem', 'lost', 'decade', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'very', 'appealing', 'actor', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'world', 'side', 'scruffy', 'school', 'hair', 'style', 'casual', 'dress', 'facial', 'stubble', 'just', 'character', 'Boyd', 'Crowder', 'Justified', 'women', 'are', 'drawn', 'look', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'noting', 'captioning', 'feature', 'one', 'may', 'need', 'use', 'viewing', 'series', 'watching', 'several', 'confused', 'minutes', 'went', 'back', 'beginning', 'turned', 'subtitles', 'oh', 'what', 'were', 'saying', 'was', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'Pearce', 'easy', 'understand', 'conversations', 'gambler', 'others', 'case', 'are', 'difficult', 'follow', 'subtitles', 'are', 'very', 'familiar', 'Aussie', 'accents', 'exteriors', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'shot', 'location', 'Melbourne', 'Sydney', 'as', 'well', 'surrounding', 'rural', 'areas', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'series', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'Set', '2', 'future', 'date']",Jack Irish anglais

Michael,"[2, 6]","...even if the start is a little cliche and shaky.Set in Pearce's native land of Australia, Jack Irish (based on the novels by Peter Temple) is a broken man, having lost his wife to an extremely disgruntled former client, he drinks... collects money for the local mob... and occasionally gets involved in private investigations.This set contains two feature length cases: Bad Debts and Black TideBad Debts introduces us to Jack with the opening murder scene of his wife, then thrusts us into his fallen lifestyle. Muddled in the middle of his downward spiral is another old client who he calls for help, but who ends up dead after a violent confrontation with police what would appear justified on the surface, but feels wrong to Jack. The journey this one death takes him on covers police corruption, corporate fraud and malfeasance, and the possible fall of the government. To help him on his quest, Jack enlists (and romances) a reporter, his mob buddies, and old connections to the case.Black Tide picks up a few months down the line from where Bad Debts ends, with Jack and Linda an item, but separated (and things are tense). An old rugby buddy of his deceased father's comes around looking for legal help concerning a debt on his house that he didn't know he had... which leads to more corporate fraud, the drug trade, and bloody murder.While it's a little rough, Jack Irish is still a quality drama that is well above the standards of most prime time procedural. It helps that Guy Pearce is the lead, most assuredly, and being a ABC/Acorn production (ABC as in Australia Broadcasting Corporation) helps its pedigree. They've been putting out a lot of good mysteries lately, like Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries and the like.If you're a fan of the modern era of Masterpiece Mysteries, Wallander, or Annika Bengtzon, Jack Irish is right up your alley.

As I write this, the latter is certainly the case; the former is present, too. This set consists of two 100-minute mysteries from the novels of Peter Temple (whom I have not read): The two episodes, &#34;Bad Debts&#34; and &#34;Black Tide&#34; feature Jack Irish, a former lawyer who now makes his living in a variety of ways, including debt collecting and investigating (and being an apprentice woodworker). In the first episode, originally aired on Australian television in 2012, Jack finds himself drawn into the investigation of a former client's death. Prior to the death, the client reached out to Jack, only to be ignored. Now, Jack finds himself back in a life he hoped to avoid. The second episode is somewhat more straightforward (in that there is less need to set up the character and his past).I found the first episode somewhat slow, but ultimately, I liked the setting, the character (or, more accurately, Guy Pearce's portrayal of the character), and the level of intelligence in the plot. The acting is restrained, leading to a more subtle crime story than is common in American television. I understand that there will be at least one more episode coming up.

Now, two of his books have been turned into a series, 'Jack Irish'. I was pleasantly surprised to find how very good they are.The opening sequence starts with a bombshell as Jack an up and coming lawyer is chatting with his wife about a home furnishing. An old client comes running into the office and a startling event takes place. The beginning credits roll. Some time later, we find Jack trying to get over his misery. He has gone through a drinking and gambling phase, and has now given up law and has become a would-be carpenter, debt collector, and working for a man who bets on horses. Jack is played by Guy Pearce, and it seems he has become Jack Irish, this role is his. Handsome, reckless, recovering from trauma, he plays this character to the 'T'.Another of Jack's old clients has called and left messages and when Jack picks them up, the man is found dead. This leads Jack on a search to find the question and the answer. Some of the answers reach into high political quarters, where he is not welcomed. A journalist, played by the beautiful. Marta Dusseldrop, is on the story and together they follow every lead. One of the most interesting sidelights of this film is the bar Jack uses as a sometime office. It is filled with old fellas who love soccer and knew his dad. He is a welcome part of the group, so to speak, and this gives some insight into his background.'Jack Irish' is a terrific series, great characters with Australia as it's background.

Dialog should be clear if it is meant to be, or subtitled when it intentionally intelligible.

I went back and looked at the Amazon product page after that, and feel that there is not enough explanation of exactly what you're getting.I have loved Guy Pearce in everything I've seen him in, but this? Not so much. And even then, he was pretty much the best thing about the piece. His character was a lawyer before a horrible incident sent him into a tailspin. He became a vengeance-seeking vigilante trying to uncover the circumstances surrounding this awful deed.This is an Australian production and most of the accents are bordering on unintelligible. Additionally, there seemed to be a lot of mumbling going on, which doesn't help when you already are having trouble deciphering an accent. I had plans to commit myself to watching the whole DVD in one evening (2 movies at around 90 minutes each). Not an hour into the first one, I found myself picking up my Kindle Fire to check Facebook and email. I think I may have fallen asleep at some point too, though it was nowhere near bedtime.

Based on the novels of Australian writer Peter Temple, it stars movie and television star Guy Pearce as the titular anti-hero, a man who lost everything he had when his wife was murdered.  Turning away from his former life as an attorney, Irish becomes a sometime private eye who drowns himself in the bottle when he can, and who is dragged back to the seedy world of lowlife criminals he once represented when a former client is killed.The thing I loved most about this series is that it was filmed as 2 feature-length movies (Bad Debts and Black Tide), rather than a bunch of 1-hour episodes.  To me, this gives the story a chance to really tell itself, and the actors an opportunity to really shine, which they do.

1613189,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00ALX3QBQ,Stephanie De Pue,"[1, 2]","In JACK IRISH, we have a recent Australian television series of noir mysteries, based on Australian author Peter Temple's award winning crime novels. The series stars the tall and handsome Emmy winner Guy Pearce (THE KING'S SPEECH, MEMENTO, IRON MAN 3) in the title role, as a former lawyer, part-time private investigator, full-time alcoholic and brooding antihero. The series, made by Australian firms,  is set, and apparently filmed, in the rougher precincts of Melbourne, Australia, certainly part of the world that few of us will have seen.  It was a ratings winner in the U.K. and Australia; two more feature length installments are in the works.  The 1st series, a box set, consists of two feature-length mysteries in a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack, running approximately 202 minutes, 3  hours, for mature audiences, as it contains strong language, violence, graphic images, nudity and sexual situations.  It has an extra 17 minute glimpse behind the scenes of BLACK TIDE.  And, thank you, RLJ Entertainment, it's got subtitles; however else would us Americans ever understand the Australian lingo - and no, I didn't catch a single `let's put the shrimp on the Barbie.'The episodes are:Disc 1 (DVD)Episode 1: Bad DebtsSuccessful criminal lawyer Jack Irish's beautiful wife is murdered by an irate client, causing Jack to  swear off the law and  his old life. So now he passes his time collecting debts, betting - in as well-informed way as possible-- on horse races, and boozing at a dingy local pub with a handful of senior citizens. Suddenly, a man he once represented - poorly, as it was right after his wife's murder and Jack was drinking heavily - dies; Jack feels he must look more deeply into the situation, to at least render justice to his client now. With the help of reporter Linda Hillier, Jack uncovers a high-level, wide-ranging conspiracy.Episode 2: Black TideAs he hopes to gain some insight into the father he hardly knew, Irish accepts a case from Des Connors, one of his dad's old friends. The man's son, Gary, has vanished after scamming $60,000 from his father. Jack throws himself headlong into the search, even though his relationship with Linda suffers as a result; he soon realizes that Gary may be mixed up with dangerous and powerful people.Seemed to me that the plots of the episodes were somewhat dated, and spoke of the 1990s.  Still, Melbourne is quite an interesting city, and a good setting for these suspenseful shows.  Pearce inhabits the title role stunningly and manfully. (He is, of course, also delineated as a cool guy, with his vintage Studebaker, his Johnnie Walker, and his cool jazz.)  I never imagined he could play a role like this after the first film I ever saw him in.  THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT, in which the actor portrayed a tall, handsome, gay female impersonator, child of a rich family and spoiled rotten, so well that, at the time, I doubted he could ever play anything else.  Then I saw him in LA CONFIDENTIAL.  All the acting is strong, particularly that of Vadin Glowna, who plays the old cabinet maker Charlie. The series comes to us with rough edges: characters make nasty comments about seniors; one of the lead characters is an Aborigine, about whom racist comments are made; racist comments are made about Jack, indicating he may be of Jewish background.  Over the years, there have been incidents and government policies that showed a racist streak in Australian society.  I've sometimes thought that `gratuitous' sex and violence can perk up many a film, as witness GAME OF THRONES.  At any rate, we loved JACK IRISH in this house.",5,Pearce Inhabits the Title Role Stunningly and Manfully,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,3621,"['JACK', 'IRISH', 'have', 'recent', 'Australian', 'television', 'series', 'noir', 'mysteries', 'based', 'Australian', 'author', 'Peter', 'Temple', 'award', 'winning', 'crime', 'novels', 'series', 'tall', 'handsome', 'Emmy', 'winner', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'THE', 'KING', 'SPEECH', 'MEMENTO', 'IRON', 'MAN', '3', 'title', 'role', 'former', 'lawyer', 'part-time', 'private', 'investigator', 'full-time', 'alcoholic', 'brooding', 'antihero', 'series', 'made', 'Australian', 'firms', 'set', 'apparently', 'filmed', 'rougher', 'precincts', 'Melbourne', 'Australia', 'certainly', 'part', 'world', 'few', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'was', 'ratings', 'winner', 'U.K.', 'Australia', 'two', 'more', 'feature', 'length', 'installments', 'are', 'works', '1st', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'two', 'feature-length', 'mysteries', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'combo', 'pack', 'running', 'approximately', '202', 'minutes', '3', 'hours', 'mature', 'audiences', 'strong', 'language', 'violence', 'graphic', 'images', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'situations', 'extra', '17', 'minute', 'glimpse', 'scenes', 'BLACK', 'TIDE', 'thank', 'RLJ', 'Entertainment', 'got', 'subtitles', 'however', 'else', 'would', 'Americans', 'ever', 'understand', 'Australian', 'lingo', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'single', 'let', 'put', 'shrimp', 'Barbie', 'episodes', 'are', 'Disc', '1', 'DVD', 'Episode', '1', 'Bad', 'DebtsSuccessful', 'criminal', 'lawyer', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'murdered', 'irate', 'client', 'causing', 'Jack', 'swear', 'off', 'law', 'old', 'life', 'So', 'now', 'time', 'collecting', 'debts', 'betting', 'well-informed', 'way', 'possible', 'horse', 'races', 'boozing', 'dingy', 'local', 'pub', 'handful', 'senior', 'citizens', 'Suddenly', 'man', 'once', 'represented', 'poorly', 'was', 'right', 'wife', 'murder', 'Jack', 'was', 'drinking', 'heavily', 'dies', 'Jack', 'must', 'look', 'more', 'deeply', 'situation', 'least', 'render', 'justice', 'client', 'now', 'help', 'reporter', 'Linda', 'Hillier', 'Jack', 'high-level', 'wide-ranging', 'conspiracy.Episode', '2', 'Black', 'TideAs', 'gain', 'insight', 'father', 'hardly', 'knew', 'Irish', 'case', 'Des', 'Connors', 'one', 'dad', 'old', 'friends', 'man', 'son', 'Gary', 'vanished', 'scamming', '60,000', 'father', 'Jack', 'headlong', 'search', 'even', 'relationship', 'Linda', 'suffers', 'result', 'soon', 'Gary', 'may', 'be', 'mixed', 'up', 'dangerous', 'powerful', 'people.Seemed', 'plots', 'episodes', 'were', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'spoke', '1990s', 'Still', 'Melbourne', 'quite', 'interesting', 'city', 'good', 'setting', 'suspenseful', 'shows', 'Pearce', 'title', 'role', 'stunningly', 'manfully', 'course', 'also', 'delineated', 'cool', 'guy', 'vintage', 'Studebaker', 'Johnnie', 'Walker', 'cool', 'jazz', 'never', 'imagined', 'could', 'play', 'role', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'ADVENTURES', 'OF', 'PRISCILLA', 'QUEEN', 'THE', 'DESERT', 'actor', 'portrayed', 'tall', 'handsome', 'gay', 'female', 'impersonator', 'child', 'rich', 'family', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'so', 'well', 'time', 'doubted', 'could', 'ever', 'play', 'anything', 'else', 'Then', 'saw', 'LA', 'CONFIDENTIAL', 'acting', 'strong', 'particularly', 'Vadin', 'Glowna', 'who', 'old', 'cabinet', 'maker', 'Charlie', 'series', 'rough', 'edges', 'characters', 'make', 'nasty', 'comments', 'seniors', 'one', 'lead', 'characters', 'Aborigine', 'whom', 'racist', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'racist', 'comments', 'are', 'made', 'Jack', 'indicating', 'may', 'be', 'Jewish', 'background', 'years', 'have', 'been', 'incidents', 'government', 'policies', 'showed', 'racist', 'streak', 'Australian', 'society', ""'ve"", 'sometimes', 'thought', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'violence', 'can', 'perk', 'up', 'many', 'film', 'witness', 'GAME', 'OF', 'THRONES', 'rate', 'loved', 'JACK', 'IRISH', 'house']",Jack Irish anglais

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[1, 2]","While many of my CD and DVD reviews are of product submitted by labels and distributors, this title came from Amazon via their Vine Reviewer Program.Apparently the character of Jack Irish is the subject of a series of ""award-winning novels"" but this DVD includes two NEW 90-minutes-plus movies made in 2012 for Australian TV with new scripts. Within the first five minutes of the first one we learn that attorney Irish's wife is murdered (no spoiler alert as it happens THAT early) and he leaves the profession while delving into alcohol and working for some loan sharks. (The alcohol issue seems to be glossed over because we never see him actually drunk).I have not read any of the novels so I approached the DVD set as a person who loves mysteries (especially British and Australian - many from RLJ- formerly Acorn Home Video).  Like many of the other reviews here, I found the character of Irish (as played by Australian actor Guy Pearce) to be interesting but the plots both confusing and not really interesting. There are some murders, police cover-ups and corruption (again, no spoiler here, it happens near the beginning). The one ""surprise"" clue isn't even that much of a surprise.These were made for Australian commercial TV - if I'm correct - but they are much more liberal that US TV so we get, not one, but two nude sex scenes (same male; same woman - neither is hard on the eyes.).There is also a 16-minute  ""Making of..."" featurette on the DVD, which is unusual for a TV series, and some of the comments sort of explain why the films don't grab the viewer. Both the Director and the two script writers comment that it is ""impossible to have a plot driven film when a novel is squeezed into 90 minutes, these have to be `character driven' films"". (I'm paraphrasing here but that's pretty much what they say.  Pearce is fun to watch - especially when it comes to ""romantic moments"" but the plots really do drag the films down. I did enjoy his performance but can only give the set 3 stars over all.By the way, the accents can sometimes be a bit thick and there are terms which will not be familiar to Americans, so you might - like me - what to use the subtitles option (they are, thankfully, in easy-to-read yellow print).I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",3,"The scriptwriters admit these two films are ""character""- (not ""plot""-) driven.

Due to guilt or friendship, he tries to solve a few small cases but ends up antagonizing powerful enemies.  These are not Agatha Christy murder mysteries but dangerous adventures against seemingly impossible odds.  Jack's friends include Linda, a TV reporter; Charlie, an old German cabinet maker who teaches him his craft; Harry, a gambler who knows how to spot unknown race horses and how to ""adjust"" the odds; Cam, Harry's bodyguard and driver; and some old football fans who idolize Jack's late father, a local football star.  The acting is superb, especially Emmy winning Guy Pearce as Jack Irish.In Bad Debts, we see a disgruntled legal client kill Jack's wife and cause him to give up criminal law.  Later, out of guilt, he tries to find out who killed a former client who might have been wrongly convicted.  What does his death have to do with someone buying abandoned waterfront warehouses?  Why does the police commissioner want him to drop the case?  And why is someone shooting at him, Harry, and Cam?In Black Tide, Jack agrees to help one of his late father's friends find his son who skipped out with $60,000 the father needs to avoid being evicted from his home.  But his investigation finds that someone else disappeared at the same time and they both may have been working in Thailand for a while.  Why does a security company run by an ex-police officer try to get him to drop the case?  Why does a policeman from a shut-down drug task force try to get Jack's help?

The DVD contains two episodes about an hour and a half in length roughly equivalent to the old made for tv movies we used to get on a regular basis in the US. I would not call the plots the same as American crime dramas due to the fact that they involve Australian politics. The characters are all interesting, including the supporting cast. Highlights, as others have mentioned, include the pub guys and the old carpenter.Crime fiction fans should enjoy these.I did not find the accents as distracting as others, but there were a lot of references to Australian politics and history. I don't need everything explained to me, though, I was okay with looking them up.In a way, I would compare this show more to the Rockford Files than to something like Sam Spade or Micky Spillane.",4,Good shows,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,817,"['are', 'good', 'shows', 'Australia', 'DVD', 'two', 'episodes', 'hour', 'half', 'length', 'roughly', 'equivalent', 'old', 'made', 'tv', 'movies', 'used', 'get', 'regular', 'basis', 'US', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'plots', 'same', 'American', 'crime', 'dramas', 'due', 'fact', 'involve', 'Australian', 'politics', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'including', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Highlights', 'others', 'have', 'mentioned', 'include', 'pub', 'guys', 'old', 'carpenter.Crime', 'fiction', 'fans', 'should', 'enjoy', 'these.I', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'accents', 'as', 'distracting', 'others', 'were', 'lot', 'references', 'Australian', 'politics', 'history', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'everything', 'explained', 'was', 'okay', 'looking', 'up.In', 'way', 'would', 'compare', 'show', 'more', 'Rockford', 'Files', 'something', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'Micky', 'Spillane']",Jack Irish anglais
1613197,A2AYDT1O1K8MG2,B00ALX3QBQ,W. Sanders,"[1, 3]","The two films from the Jack Irish series (Bad Debts & Black Tide) were delivered in what I expect is a genuine, unaffected Australian accent, and the plots are complex, and so I had difficulty following everything because I kept dropping heavily accented words and idioms. Most of the actors were 40-something and over, and so it's definitely for grown-ups, and that's fine by me. (No pimply faced coming of age or cute children to spoil the mood or dumb it down.)Every actor in the series seemed to be characters in their own right--nothing humdrum about any of them; some were quite crude rude burping farting cretins, while others were roles with quirky personalities and clear passions. As a result, the main character played by Guy Pearce (Jack Irish) was not as interesting as some of those around him. While for some this may be a deal breaker, for me it helped focus on the various problems Jack had to solve. His own personality ranged from depressed to almost petulant carrying an air of near defeat and anger. We learn right off the bat that Jack's wife is killed by some nut-job, who then turns the gun on himself. So there's no mystery of who-done-it? or even what-could-I-have-done-to-stop-it? Rather, it's almost like an act of nature. Bad luck, and life sucks; so what did you expect?The villains in Jack's life are more of the corporate/corrupt government type than the bank-robber, thief and burglar (given Australian history, regular criminals are held in higher esteem than they are in the US where our forefathers were the goody two-shoes Puritans.) So while the stories may start off with a fairly pedestrian crime and criminal, they seem to end up in some powerful force beyond the police (or the police themselves) that takes Jack's action to uncover.Part of the uncovering is Jack's on-again, off-again post-wife girlfriend; a TV news hound named Linda Hillier (Marta Dusseldorp). She's the kind of woman who is fetchingly attractive but you're not quite sure why. In profile, she sports a prominent Roman nose that turns almost into a fin-narrow one faced head-on; but quite a pretty one. In the second film (Black Tide), she and Jack have broken up, but in Bad Debts she has a much richer role in working with Jack to uncover evil-doers. Jack's driver is an aboriginal Australian, but he is also a side-kick and friend of Jack's. He can be handy with a gun. Some of the other characters depicted as Jack's friends mumble through their lines in Aussie-talk, and I am not at all certain who they are in Jack's life.Overall, I liked the stories and the characters, especially those surrounding and interacting with Jack Irish.  I don't get the sense of Film Noir even though the events and characters are dark enough. Maybe it's the filming. The French film 'Coup De Torchon,' based on Jim Thompson's Pop. 1280, shows how to create a film noir in pastels; and so I'm not stuck on the high contrast black and white films of Bogart, Dick Powell and Robert Mitchum from the '40s. To me it came across as a mix of melodrama and action-adventure. The photography is stunning, and the acting is first rate. The stories seem muddled though, and while that may be partly the fault of understanding the accent; part may be do to the film itself.",4,Complex and an acquired taste,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,3260,"['two', 'films', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'series', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'Black', 'Tide', 'were', 'delivered', 'what', 'expect', 'genuine', 'unaffected', 'Australian', 'accent', 'plots', 'are', 'complex', 'so', 'had', 'difficulty', 'following', 'everything', 'kept', 'dropping', 'heavily', 'accented', 'words', 'idioms', 'Most', 'actors', 'were', '40-something', 'definitely', 'grown-ups', 'fine', 'pimply', 'faced', 'coming', 'age', 'cute', 'children', 'spoil', 'mood', 'dumb', 'down', 'actor', 'series', 'seemed', 'be', 'characters', 'own', 'right', 'nothing', 'humdrum', 'were', 'quite', 'crude', 'rude', 'burping', 'farting', 'cretins', 'others', 'were', 'roles', 'quirky', 'personalities', 'clear', 'passions', 'result', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'Guy', 'Pearce', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'interesting', 'may', 'be', 'deal', 'breaker', 'helped', 'focus', 'various', 'problems', 'Jack', 'had', 'solve', 'own', 'personality', 'ranged', 'depressed', 'almost', 'petulant', 'carrying', 'air', 'near', 'defeat', 'anger', 'learn', 'right', 'bat', 'Jack', 'wife', 'killed', 'nut-job', 'who', 'then', 'gun', 'mystery', 'who-done-it', 'even', 'what-could-I-have-done-to-stop-it', 'Rather', 'almost', 'act', 'nature', 'Bad', 'luck', 'life', 'sucks', 'so', 'what', 'did', 'expect', 'villains', 'Jack', 'life', 'are', 'more', 'corporate/corrupt', 'government', 'type', 'bank-robber', 'thief', 'burglar', 'given', 'Australian', 'history', 'regular', 'criminals', 'are', 'held', 'higher', 'esteem', 'are', 'US', 'where', 'forefathers', 'were', 'goody', 'two-shoes', 'Puritans', 'So', 'stories', 'may', 'start', 'off', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'crime', 'criminal', 'seem', 'end', 'up', 'powerful', 'force', 'police', 'police', 'Jack', 'action', 'uncover.Part', 'uncovering', 'Jack', 'on-again', 'off-again', 'post-wife', 'girlfriend', 'TV', 'news', 'hound', 'named', 'Linda', 'Hillier', 'Marta', 'Dusseldorp', 'kind', 'woman', 'who', 'fetchingly', 'attractive', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'why', 'profile', 'sports', 'prominent', 'Roman', 'nose', 'almost', 'fin-narrow', 'one', 'faced', 'head-on', 'pretty', 'one', 'second', 'film', 'Black', 'Tide', 'Jack', 'have', 'broken', 'up', 'Bad', 'Debts', 'much', 'richer', 'role', 'working', 'Jack', 'uncover', 'evil-doers', 'Jack', 'driver', 'aboriginal', 'Australian', 'also', 'side-kick', 'friend', 'Jack', 'can', 'be', 'handy', 'gun', 'other', 'characters', 'depicted', 'Jack', 'friends', 'mumble', 'lines', 'Aussie-talk', 'am', 'not', 'certain', 'who', 'are', 'Jack', 'life.Overall', 'liked', 'stories', 'characters', 'especially', 'surrounding', 'interacting', 'Jack', 'Irish', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'Film', 'Noir', 'even', 'events', 'characters', 'are', 'dark', 'enough', 'Maybe', 'filming', 'French', 'film', ""'Coup"", 'De', 'Torchon', 'based', 'Jim', 'Thompson', 'Pop', '1280', 'how', 'create', 'film', 'noir', 'pastels', 'so', ""'m"", 'not', 'stuck', 'high', 'contrast', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'Bogart', 'Dick', 'Powell', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', ""'40s"", 'came', 'mix', 'melodrama', 'action-adventure', 'photography', 'stunning', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'stories', 'seem', 'muddled', 'may', 'be', 'partly', 'fault', 'understanding', 'accent', 'part', 'may', 'be', 'do', 'film']",Jack Irish anglais
