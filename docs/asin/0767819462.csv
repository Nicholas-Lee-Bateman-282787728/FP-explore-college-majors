This overwraught sobfest features  Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts as mom and stepmom respectively, working  together to build a stable environment for the kids under trying  circumstances (illness, kids' hostility towards Julia, Julia's busy career,  a dad/husband who raises his voice, but can't lift a finger).  While the  premise is admirable, the result is lots of overacting and overreacting  from the usually watchable Sarandon and Roberts.

Let's start with the fact that Susan Saradon's character is so far from unreal it is not funny.  She dotes on her kids to a fault, keeps up the 3 story Victorian house all by herself, is smart and funny.  So I guess the only reason her husband didn't want her anymore is because she grew older.  But at least they still can be friends.  Hell, he even went out and bought a lid of grass for her to help with the cancer treatment.  I hate the depiction of father is suppose to be spending time with the kids and they are being taken care of by the fiance'.  Dad has to go to work, well doesn't she?  She loses her job over his kids crisis?  The mom doesn't have any friends or relatives that the kids can go to while she is in treatment?  No, she has to go to the woman who lost her son while she was working on a photo shoot. Too silly for words.

15053,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0767819462,,"[6, 18]","Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck.

15066,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0767819462,D. Litton,"[6, 8]","Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon light up the screen in &quot;Stepmom,&quot; a heartwarming and emotionally involving comedy/drama which tells the story of two women, one divorced, the other married to her ex-husband, and the hurdles they must jump in order to find a common ground of understanding. The movie has it laughs, tears, and an upbeat attitude that keeps going throughout, telling its story in an appealing fashion with the help of its brilliant cast and director Chris Columbus. You can enjoy this movie for everything it has to offer and feel satisfied in the end with how you spent your time; I did.Jackie and Luke are divorced, which is emotionally taxing on their two children, Anna and Ben, Anna refusing to accept the fact that her parents are never getting back together again. Ben is too young to understand much of what is going on; he merely aides Anna in making Luke's girlfriend, Isabel, completely miserable. This includes hounding her for unwashed laundry, putting down her lunches, and just about anything they can to make it look like they have been treated with less care than they would under their mother. The movie's setup of these relationships between different characters is well-done, keeping its focus on the children's actions and their feelings on the situations they are put into.As most ex-wives will do, Jackie is condescending of Isabel, looking down on her as a self-centered woman who cares more for her work and personal life than for the children under her care. They have many sparring sessions and heated arguments, but it's clear that they cannot argue forever, and as the children begin to warm to Isabel, so does the friendship between Jackie and Isabel begin to form. Soon, they are helping each other through tough times, trading tips on caring for the children, but still maintaining that small spark of conflict which will surface time and again as Jackie realizes her children are no longer solely under her influence.The movie deals with a lot of real-to-life family issues that will hit home with most viewers and is sure to strike an emotional chord in audiences everywhere. One of those issues is the fact that a divorce is more about how to deal with the children than about getting on with life. The movie does not take away the focus from the childrens' feelings towards their situation. At one point, Anna stands up and shouts, &quot;You didn't ask me if I wanted a new mother!&quot; The story is still about the feud between Jackie and Isabel, but this feud centers around what each of them feels is best for the children, keeping with the fact that in a divorce, they are the ones who are most affected.Actors Jena Malone and Liam Aiken, Anna and Ben, do a terrific job in bringing out all of that emotion and feeling in their characters. Aiken's character is not required to be as emotional as Malone's: he is only eight years old in the movie, and does not clearly understand what his parents are going through. He is merely along for the ride, going with what his parents say and what his sister wants, and Aiken brings all of that childhood innocence out perfectly and with believability. Malone must provide a much more involved role: her character is older, and lashes out against her father for leaving his mother and preparing to be with a woman half his age. Malone is full of tears, anger, and laughs, and her performance is heartwrenching and convincing.Another issue is embedded in the relationship between Jackie and Isabel. Jackie has the maternal instinct where Isabel is trying her best, and the story is intensified emotionally by the clashes in how they feel the children should be raised. When Jackie realizes that Isabel is going to be a permanent part of her children's lives, she also comes to the realization that she cannot keep arguing with her about how to raise the children. As they come to an understanding of one another, it's intriguing to watch the two actresses interact onscreen.Susan Sarandon is plays Jackie, who is stubborn and becomes quite disturbed when Isabel steps onto her turf. She brings out all this emotion and feeling, as well as her actions and reactions, convincingly, matching the performance of Roberts, her opposite. Roberts is Isabel, and she brings all the brightness and charm of her own person into the role while also maintaining a short emotional fuse. It is easy to see that the two actresses are having fun in their roles, and their pairing for this movie is outstanding. Their performances make this one of the best movies of the year. Ed Harris plays the part of Luke, who knows how Jackie feels but wishes that she and Isabel would be able to come to an understanding of one another. His performance is earnest and warming, and like his costars, he makes his role believable and interesting.&quot;Stepmom&quot; is one of those feel-good movies that was able to keep my interest throughout. There is a twist in the plot that I dare not even mention, because the filmmakers and producers have done a pretty good job of not giving it away in the promotional material. There is a lot of love between the characters, brought out by the stellar cast and a director whose films in this field have excelled. Based on emotional depth and connectivity, &quot;Stepmom&quot; is a nice piece of heart that is filled with true human feeling.",4,Focuses on family and children.,985996800,"03 31,

""Step Mom"" is one of her best films.  I'm not really a big Susan Sarandon fan but she was good in this movie.  It revolves around the lives of the step mother conflcting with the mother from the previous marriage.  The kids in this movie help liven up the movie and unfortunately havent been in any big name future films since.  Jackie ends up getting cancer later in the movie which will bring tears to your eyes in some scenes.  Isabel (Julia Roberts) is pretty much an artsy photographer who is considered ""hip"" by Jackie, the mother of the children.  They have to put up with Isabel's poor motherhood instincts like accidentally ""losing"" one of the children in one scene.  Later in the movie you grow to like both mothers.  Even the father Luke gets likeable later in the movie as his character becomes more real.  The cast of the movie is pretty talented.  This is one of the better films Julia Roberts has been in.  While ""The Pelican Brief"" is my all-time favorite of hers, ""Stepmom"" is still worth watching even though it's an older movie.

One reviewer said children are not aloud to act this way in  real life, HA. This was a very mild case of what true step families go  through. These childrens lives are being torn apart and they will stop at  nothing to stop their pain. But as the movie shows, it's not because they  are bad, and the stepmom isn't bad for falling in love with their dad, and  once you see through the pain there really can be peace in the end with  true love and understanding.

15077,A2NLDZ1ISQV2Z7,0767819462,Grace,"[27, 29]","I always have and always will consider this a very meaningful and worthwhile movie. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were outstanding choices for the lead roles because they truly knew how to fit the types of characters they were playing. Susan Sarandon is Jackie Harrison, a highly devoted mother who is an outstanding example of a woman who loves and places her children above herself. Her ex-husband Luke (Ed Harris) finds a new love, Isabel (Julia Roberts). The whole situation is difficult for Jackie and both of her young children, especially her 12-year-old daughter Anna, who resents Isabel. When Susan is diagnosed with fatal cancer, it becomes absolutely necessary for the two kids to learn to accept Isabel. Many, many hardships and challenges rise between Susan and Isabel before they are finally able to put aside their differences, become friends, and figure out how to handle the future of their family--a future that they can no longer deny. I especially liked this movie because it deals with such serious and complex issues that many of us can at least appreciate if we have not experienced it ourselves. You really feel the tone of the issue through Anna, Susan's oldest child. She is such a horrible brat, you want to kick her, but then you soften when you realize that she is just scared and upset because she loves both of her parents, and it is hard for her to get through all of the changes. Any of us can understand or even relate to that. Although I enjoyed most aspects of this movie, I really loved the way Susan taught her children not to be afraid of her death, especially her very young son. There's no greater way to show your love for your child than by putting on a brave face during the scariest moment of your life in order to spare them the fear that you feel yourself.

One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, &quot;Anna! You DO NOT run out on your mother!&quot; I was moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, &quot;Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me.&quot; I thought everyone in the movie gave a very moving performance.

Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show.  But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family.  It remains a very fine movie.

Divorce is not an easy matter and remarrying is even more difficult for the children. But a stepmom has to learn how to become and be a real mother, has to learn how to capture the children's attention, interest and trust. This is done especially because the real mother has cancer and is going to die. When she realises this she stops fighting and helps the stepmom to be accepted by the kids because she has to give way to her since she is going to go and leave forever. The relation between the two mothers, the real one and the step one, is explored in great details and is very convincing. The kids are also very good and full of feeling and true emotion.

Though I found this movie moving, emotional and at times fun, it lacks in truth.  Considering I've been through a divorce with my parents and my father remarried, I know how it is, somewhat.  I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should.The two children, Sarandon's and Harris' children are played extremely well.  For their ages, they act similar to what would happen.  The younger boy doesn't feel much different except asks 'mommy, if you want me to hate her [meaning Julia Roberts], I will' - typical for a young boy to side with his mother but also not be angry at the other woman in his fathers life only because he doesn't quite understand yet.  The daughter however is like pin point.  She's angry and doesn't seem to give Isabelle [Roberts] a chance.  When Isabelle brings home a puppy to try and win her love, she exclaims she's allergic to dogs but is actually lying.  She doesn't want Isabelle to think she is giving her any part of her.

He has two children, a young boy named Ben (Liam Aiken) and a teenage girl named Anna (Jena Malone), with his ex-wife Jackie (Susan Surandon).Jackie does everything she can to undermine the kids relationship with Isabel short of coming out and telling them to hate her. But it is implied. When she finds out that her breast cancer has returned she's worried about the kind of mother she's leaving her kids with. It comes down to deciding if she's going to continue to sabotage Isabel or help her to be the best Stepmom she can be.Surandon is inspirational as the grief stricken mom trying to drink up every blessed moment she has left with her children while leaving them with fond memories of their mother. This film is a roller coaster of emotions: love, jealousy, hate, anger, regret, loss and so much more is portrayed within a few hours.This is one of my favorite dramatic comedy films starring two of my favorite female lead actresses. It makes me laugh and cry every time I see it. This film is so relevant to today's families showing that children and parents don't have to choose sides and that all members can have an enriched involvement if everyone chooses to give a little, accept one another's uniqueness and realize that life is a rocky road no matter who you love.

It is mature in that it isn't some silly thing about removing the barriers to falling in love - by far the easiest part - but in how to move on after a divorce.  The actors are extremely fine, and their characters evolve throughout the entire film:  the left-over mom is angry, the stepmom is a rather hard-edged career woman, and the kids are expressing pain and hostility in their own way.  Happily, the husband is not a simple jerk, but a guy working very hard to help everyone along the way to whatever comes next.  The way that they all adapt is entirely believable, bringing a realism that you rarely see in love films, and this is surely about love.Unfortunately, there are certain scenes that don't quite ring true to me, in particular those involving the kids and their rock.  The siblings get on way too well, in particular the young son is way too accommodating and nice.  But overall, it is done with sensitivity, funny without being a comedy, and sad without being a melodrama.Recommended.

15115,AW3FTPCBPVQNB,0767819462,Robert J. Schneider,"[1, 1]","I actually got this DVD, plus four others, for free! It was part of a special deal that I got with the purchase of my Toshiba DVD player.  It sat around my house for a few months before I finally opened it and played it.  I had been a little reluctant to see it because, even though it stars one of my favorite actresses--Susan Sarandon, it looked like a stereotypical oversentimentalized ""chick flick."" I was pleasantly surprised.There is not one false note in this movie.  The screenplay, courtesy of a whopping FIVE writers (which usually spells disaster for most movies), sticks very close to reality.  We get a sense that these characters are three-dimensional and REAL, and not merely functions of the plot.  The tension between the estranged wife (played by Sarandon) and the title character (played by Julia Roberts) is palpable and believable, with no one being made the saint nor the villian.  These characters have virtues and faults just like anybody else. They also have clear reasons and MOTIVATIONS for the way they feel, and for the things they do.  Ed Harris, as the man standing between the woman he loves and the woman he once loved (and still cares very much for), also rings true in his performance and makes us feel the inner tensions felt by his character.  I even liked the two young actors playing the kids, and the way their parts were written: these are real kids with real feelings and emotions, and are not just there to look and act cute.  They are caught in an uncomfortable situation not of their making, and we really feel for them.Although the last half-hour does reflect certain conventions of Hollywood dramas (""Terms of Endearment"" comes to mind, a little bit anyway), STEPMOM never falls into cliche` territory.  It deals with the situation bravely, and doesn't lose its step.  By the end of the film, I felt like I knew these characters and cared about them, because they contained aspects of real people I have known.Basically, if you like to watch a good family-centered drama every once in a while, then I definitely recommend this movie.  It is definitely better than most others of its type.",4,Very Good Movie with Very Powerful Performances :),989971200,"05 16, 2001",2001,2135,"['actually', 'got', 'DVD', 'four', 'others', 'free', 'was', 'part', 'special', 'deal', 'got', 'purchase', 'Toshiba', 'DVD', 'player', 'sat', 'house', 'few', 'months', 'finally', 'opened', 'played', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'reluctant', 'see', 'even', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'looked', 'stereotypical', 'oversentimentalized', 'chick', 'flick', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.There', 'not', 'one', 'false', 'note', 'movie', 'screenplay', 'courtesy', 'whopping', 'FIVE', 'writers', 'usually', 'disaster', 'most', 'movies', 'very', 'close', 'reality', 'get', 'sense', 'characters', 'are', 'three-dimensional', 'REAL', 'not', 'merely', 'functions', 'plot', 'tension', 'estranged', 'wife', 'played', 'Sarandon', 'title', 'character', 'played', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'palpable', 'believable', 'one', 'being', 'made', 'saint', 'villian', 'characters', 'have', 'virtues', 'faults', 'just', 'anybody', 'else', 'also', 'have', 'clear', 'reasons', 'MOTIVATIONS', 'way', 'feel', 'things', 'do', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'man', 'standing', 'woman', 'woman', 'once', 'loved', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'also', 'true', 'performance', 'feel', 'inner', 'tensions', 'felt', 'character', 'even', 'liked', 'two', 'young', 'actors', 'playing', 'kids', 'way', 'parts', 'were', 'written', 'are', 'real', 'kids', 'real', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'there', 'look', 'act', 'cute', 'are', 'caught', 'uncomfortable', 'situation', 'not', 'making', 'really', 'feel', 'last', 'half-hour', 'reflect', 'certain', 'conventions', 'Hollywood', 'dramas', 'Terms', 'Endearment', 'mind', 'little', 'bit', 'anyway', 'STEPMOM', 'never', 'cliche', 'territory', 'situation', 'bravely', ""n't"", 'lose', 'step', 'end', 'film', 'felt', 'knew', 'characters', 'cared', 'contained', 'aspects', 'real', 'people', 'have', 'known.Basically', 'like', 'watch', 'good', 'family-centered', 'drama', 'once', 'while', 'then', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'definitely', 'better', 'most', 'others', 'type']",Stepmom VHS

It features a mostly terrific -- and consciously sentimental -- screenplay that allows its two stars, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, to cover new territory as actresses.  The biting, realistic dialog between two strong, competitive women resonates with the ring of truth.  The children in the movie shine throughout, and Ed Harris is, as usual, appealing, masculine, bringing gravity to his role as the man in the middle.  The Christmas settings, the snowfalls, the terminal illness, and the classic song &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot; all combine to produce more than a few well-earned tears, none more so than in the final ten minutes. Chris Columbus, the director, allows delicate, and sometimes not so delicate, humor, to ease the real pain of many of these well-wraught scenes.

Isabel spends a large part of this movie trying to find a way into the two children's lives and to have them accept her as part of theirs.  And of course this is never easy.  The role of Mom(Susan Sarandon) is built as a strong character who has endured her husband leaving her and is trying to raise her kids with shared custody.  She is often characterized as the one who can do no wrong.  The plot thickens as the children and the audience sees Luke wanting to marry Isabel and then their mother falling sick with cancer.This was a truly outstanding film both because of the actors themselves, but also because it brought the audience so close to the heart of the film.I would definately recommend that anyone see this movie, especially if you need a good cry or if you are a parent going through a divorce and/or remarriage.

IT  CAN  AFFECT  THEM  IN  WAYS  NOONE  COULD  IMAGINE.  THIS MOVIE  DEALS  WITH  THE  EVERYDAY  DRAMA  OF  A  SPLIT  UP  FAMILY  AND  ADJUSTING  TO  A  PARENTS  NEW  RELATIONSHIP.  I  THINK  THE  12  YEAR  OLD  IN  THIS  MOVIE  WAS  MORE  AFFECTED BY  THESE  EVENTS  THAN  HER  YOUNG  BROTHER.  SHE  WAS  VERY  HOSTILE  AND  DEMANDING  BUT  TURNED  OUT SWEET  AS  PIE.  I  HOPE  THIS  IS AN  ISSUE  MY  DAUGHTER  WILL  NEVER  HAVE TO  DEAL  WITH.  IF  YOU  CRY  DURING  MOVIES  BE  PREPARED.

Everyone fights  -- parents,  children, ex-wife and girlfriend, stepmother and children; you almost feel  like you've been inadvertantly caught with a friend when she decides to  have a major argument with a family member  -- makes you want to slip out  of the room until the storm is over.Chris Columbus did a wonderful job  directing this film -- the arguments were uncomfortable, but they were  supposed to be.  Better, there were some poignant moments that really  worked.  STEPMOM is a realistic fable with just a touch of magic to make  the audience happy.The cast was superb -- Julia Roberts and Susan  Sarandon gave great performances, and the kids (not sure of their names)  were both adorable and the biggest brats you've ever seen -- a great  combination.  Ed Harris was curiously absent from the film, showing up in  less than half the scenes.This movie is everything a drama is supposed  to be: funny, moving, difficult, sad.  Chris Columbus captured some  beautiful moments, and some hard ones as well, making the audience better  for the journey.",4,Balance of tension and sweetness,960422400,"06 8, 2000",2000,1250,"['movie', 'tough', 'one', 'watch', 'many', 'scenes', 'especially', 'first', 'hour', 'are', 'riddled', 'tension', 'kind', 'feel', 'when', ""'ve"", 'just', 'confronted', 'someone', 'head-on', 'Everyone', 'fights', 'parents', 'children', 'ex-wife', 'girlfriend', 'stepmother', 'children', 'almost', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'been', 'inadvertantly', 'caught', 'friend', 'when', 'have', 'major', 'argument', 'family', 'member', 'want', 'slip', 'room', 'storm', 'over.Chris', 'Columbus', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'directing', 'film', 'arguments', 'were', 'uncomfortable', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'Better', 'were', 'poignant', 'moments', 'really', 'worked', 'STEPMOM', 'realistic', 'fable', 'just', 'touch', 'magic', 'make', 'audience', 'happy.The', 'cast', 'was', 'superb', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'gave', 'great', 'performances', 'kids', 'not', 'sure', 'names', 'were', 'adorable', 'biggest', 'brats', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'great', 'combination', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'was', 'curiously', 'absent', 'film', 'showing', 'up', 'less', 'scenes.This', 'movie', 'everything', 'drama', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'moving', 'difficult', 'sad', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'captured', 'beautiful', 'moments', 'hard', 'ones', 'as', 'well', 'making', 'audience', 'better', 'journey']",Stepmom VHS
