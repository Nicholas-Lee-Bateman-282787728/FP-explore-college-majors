My husband and I would watch the reruns every New Years Day during marathons.  It improved our marriage because we got to see the funny side of married life and a show where the couple was working class, poor and struggling just like us but, despite all that, they loved each other.  The remake added another commonality by showing Ralph & Alice and Norton & Trixy as Black Americans.  It kept to the show's intent of being humorous and that in a working-class marriage, love can survive.  In this movie, finally, the Honeymooners show ends on a happy financial victory.

936792,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000B6TTAU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[5, 5]","Here we have one of the most ill-conceived remakes in history, a truly forgettable film exploiting a well-known, much-loved commodity for money (and very little of it, as things turned out).  Exploiting may not be the right word for me to use here, however; it's not as if this movie sought out to make fun of the original series, and the transformation of the Kramdens and Nortons into middle-class African-Americans carries no kind of overt or underlying statement whatsoever.  The only problem with this odd movie is its failure to be very funny.  I've always said that Cedric the Entertainer is always funny.  Well, I can't say that anymore.  I did get a few laughs over the course of the film, but watching this modern version of The Honeymooners is sort of like watching a fish out of water: initially, it's sort of funny to watch it flop around all over the place; before very long, though, it starts to get boring, all that activity begins to slow down more and more as it makes its way to a painful death, and you're left just standing there, hoping to sneak away before anyone notices you were ever there to begin with.  Someone really should have thrown this fish out of water back.None of the actors seemed to have his heart in what he was doing.  Cedric had his moments, but they were few and far between, and I couldn't help but notice that even he seemed rather uncomfortably embarrassed delivering his final and fully predictable line at the very end.  There was no real chemistry to be found among the actors, either.  Gabrielle Union is a lovely young actress, but she just doesn't have the feisty nature of a true Alice Kramden; she's just too nice for the role.  Mike Epps didn't exactly scream Ed Norton to my brain, either.Plot-wise, there's not much to talk about.  Alice and Trixie want to have a home of their own, and Ralph's many get rich quick schemes prevent them from putting a down payment down on the duplex they've found.  Ralph scrambles around, jumping from one hare-brained money-making scheme trying to get the money back before Alice finds out it's gone.  From sewer-bound trolley cars to dumpster dog racing, Ralph just keeps getting himself closer and closer to the proverbial doghouse.  Throw an embarrassingly trite ending on this puppy, and you've got The Honeymooners movie in a nutshell.The fact that Cedric the Entertainer isn't even very funny in this movie tells you all you need to know about the script.  It's all just incredibly bland and lifeless; I never even felt like I was watching a movie.  Personally, I think the film might actually have done better without a tie-in to classic television's The Honeymooners, as that really just set this decidedly weak film up for a fairly substantial fall.  On its own merits, I would give The Honeymooners two and a half stars - the writing is weak, the characters have little depth, and the whole movie just isn't that funny.  I have to round that down to two stars, however, in deference to the Great One, who may or may not have been spinning in his grave when this film was released.",2,"Oh, how sweet it isn't",1148515200,"05 25, 2006",2006,3082,"['Here', 'have', 'one', 'most', 'ill-conceived', 'remakes', 'history', 'truly', 'forgettable', 'film', 'exploiting', 'well-known', 'much-loved', 'commodity', 'money', 'very', 'little', 'things', 'turned', 'out', 'Exploiting', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'right', 'word', 'use', 'here', 'however', 'not', 'movie', 'sought', 'out', 'make', 'fun', 'original', 'series', 'transformation', 'Kramdens', 'Nortons', 'middle-class', 'African-Americans', 'kind', 'overt', 'underlying', 'statement', 'whatsoever', 'only', 'problem', 'odd', 'movie', 'failure', 'be', 'very', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'always', 'said', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'always', 'funny', 'Well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'anymore', 'did', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'course', 'film', 'watching', 'modern', 'version', 'Honeymooners', 'sort', 'watching', 'fish', 'water', 'initially', 'sort', 'funny', 'watch', 'flop', 'place', 'very', 'long', 'get', 'boring', 'activity', 'slow', 'down', 'more', 'more', 'way', 'painful', 'death', ""'re"", 'left', 'just', 'standing', 'there', 'hoping', 'sneak', 'away', 'anyone', 'notices', 'were', 'ever', 'there', 'begin', 'Someone', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'thrown', 'fish', 'water', 'back.None', 'actors', 'seemed', 'have', 'heart', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'Cedric', 'had', 'moments', 'were', 'few', 'far', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'even', 'seemed', 'rather', 'uncomfortably', 'embarrassed', 'delivering', 'final', 'fully', 'predictable', 'line', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'real', 'chemistry', 'be', 'found', 'actors', 'either', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'lovely', 'young', 'actress', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'feisty', 'nature', 'true', 'Alice', 'Kramden', 'just', 'too', 'nice', 'role', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'scream', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'brain', 'either.Plot-wise', 'not', 'much', 'talk', 'Alice', 'Trixie', 'want', 'have', 'home', 'own', 'Ralph', 'many', 'get', 'rich', 'quick', 'schemes', 'prevent', 'putting', 'down', 'payment', 'down', 'duplex', ""'ve"", 'found', 'Ralph', 'around', 'jumping', 'one', 'hare-brained', 'money-making', 'scheme', 'trying', 'get', 'money', 'back', 'Alice', 'out', 'gone', 'sewer-bound', 'trolley', 'cars', 'dumpster', 'dog', 'racing', 'Ralph', 'just', 'getting', 'closer', 'closer', 'proverbial', 'doghouse', 'Throw', 'embarrassingly', 'trite', 'ending', 'puppy', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Honeymooners', 'movie', 'nutshell.The', 'fact', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', ""n't"", 'even', 'very', 'funny', 'movie', 'need', 'know', 'script', 'just', 'incredibly', 'bland', 'lifeless', 'never', 'even', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'Personally', 'think', 'film', 'might', 'actually', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'tie-in', 'classic', 'television', 'Honeymooners', 'really', 'just', 'set', 'decidedly', 'weak', 'film', 'up', 'fairly', 'substantial', 'fall', 'own', 'merits', 'would', 'give', 'Honeymooners', 'two', 'half', 'writing', 'weak', 'characters', 'have', 'little', 'depth', 'whole', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'have', 'round', 'down', 'two', 'stars', 'however', 'deference', 'Great', 'One', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'spinning', 'grave', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released']",Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk

At the same time, it's not like a remake to a 1950s TV classic is needed, nevermind urbanized for an audience that doesn't care for the original material.  The only two things it has going for it are the two things that determine what you like in a film: do you think Cedric the Entertainer and/or Mike Epps are funny?  If so, bring your family and have a decent time.Unfortunately for me, I don't like Cedric and Mike.  They're two of my least favorite comedians in the stand-up business, because their material depend so much on being bumbling idiots with a stubborn attitude; some people dig this, but I don't see it as a smart or charming form of comedy.  It's the overall incompetence that get me in a bitter mood, although they did have one decent role in their career (""Barbershop"" and ""The Hangover""). Actually, their incompetence is actually in favor of the source material.  It's about two fools with attractive wives who come up with implausible get-rich schemes that never work, and while this is a premise serve to annoy, it apparently is faithful to the original formula.And yet I couldn't suspend disbelief that Cedric and Mike's characters didn't know what they were doing. They live in the streets for their whole lives, understanding what kind of world they're living in...and they were being fooled by obvious crooks like John Leguizamo or that they didn't know they were breaking & entering private property in one scene? Sure, they make unsuccessful schemes, but they shouldn't be THAT oblivious with their surroundings. Nothing's funny about the film because of that.  The pretentious stupidity behind their actions, the obnoxiously overbearing acting that didn't go far, and lousy pratfalls.The movie delves deep by have Gabrielle Union and Regina Hall (the wives) making deal about a duplex, but their husbands keep spending movie on useless stuff, so it's a story about the husbands learning about atonement and understand that family is important.  Well, the movie's about gambling and bidding high stakes without knowing the financial consequences, stuff that is rather immoral on a family comedy, but at least the heart is in the right place...maybe?  But seriously, the movie did try to make the characters sympathetic one way or the other, and I did grew a bit attached to Cedric and Mike's characters overtime.  I enjoyed the company with Gabrielle (who REALLY needs to be in better films than this), and at least the movie's not crass or offensive, so it's safe to watch.  That's the overall criticism I got with ""The Honeymooners"": safe.

936796,A3O7S6FPLIKP5C,B000B6TTAU,J.Espresso,"[2, 2]","First the disclaimer - I grew up in NYC at a time when the original Honeymooners series was on WPIX just about every night at 11:00 pm. As such, I've seen every episode and have always loved the show. I had heard all the terrible things about this film and was prepared for a train wreck of a movie. Surprise - there is no train wreck here! (Although there is a buried Pullman car).This is the first movie I've seen Cedric the Entertainer in, and I can't imagine a better choice. Chris Farley might have been able to pull it off if he were alive. And Kevin James is already playing ""Ralph Kramden"" on the King of Queens (think about it - that show is basically an updated Honeymooners, except ""Ralph"" drives a UPS truck instead of a bus, and has an obnoxious father-in-law instead of mother-in-law.) I was less thrilled with the Alice and Trixie roles here, but Cedric was perfect and Mike Epps carried off an acceptable Ed Norton. No, it's not the TV series, but it's far from the worst updating of a TV show into a movie you'll find.Having read prior reviews here, I've been a little dismayed to see all of the negativity over the fact that this was cast with black actors and actresses. So what? There is nothing inherent in these characters to prevent this story being told with either a white or black cast. Working class blue collar NYC employees come in various shades and races, and a black NYC bus driver - a black Ralph Kramden - doesn't exactly stretch the boundaries of imagination or credibility here. What's more important is that they get the spirit of the characters right, and Cedric had that spirit, Epps had enough of it, and Alice and Trixie - although they could have used a bit more - are secondary players anyway. I never viewed this as a black Honeymooners. I viewed it as an updated Honeymooners.This isn't a great movie, but it's decent entertainment, and - contrary to a previous poster's comment - light years better than the Bewitched updated film version.Recommended for a light, fun night of popcorn on the sofa with your sweetie.",3,Pleasant - Not as bad as Prior Reviews Suggest,1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2061,"['First', 'disclaimer', 'grew', 'up', 'NYC', 'time', 'when', 'original', 'Honeymooners', 'series', 'was', 'WPIX', 'just', 'about', 'night', '11:00', 'pm', 'such', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'show', 'had', 'heard', 'terrible', 'things', 'film', 'was', 'prepared', 'train', 'wreck', 'movie', 'Surprise', 'train', 'wreck', 'here', 'buried', 'Pullman', 'car', '.This', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'better', 'choice', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'were', 'alive', 'Kevin', 'James', 'already', 'playing', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'King', 'Queens', 'think', 'show', 'basically', 'updated', 'Honeymooners', 'Ralph', 'UPS', 'truck', 'instead', 'bus', 'obnoxious', 'father-in-law', 'instead', 'mother-in-law', 'was', 'less', 'thrilled', 'Alice', 'Trixie', 'roles', 'here', 'Cedric', 'was', 'perfect', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'carried', 'off', 'acceptable', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'No', 'not', 'TV', 'series', 'far', 'worst', 'updating', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find.Having', 'read', 'prior', 'reviews', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'little', 'dismayed', 'see', 'negativity', 'fact', 'was', 'cast', 'black', 'actors', 'actresses', 'what', 'nothing', 'inherent', 'characters', 'prevent', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'white', 'black', 'cast', 'Working', 'class', 'blue', 'collar', 'NYC', 'employees', 'come', 'various', 'shades', 'races', 'black', 'NYC', 'bus', 'driver', 'black', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'stretch', 'boundaries', 'imagination', 'credibility', 'here', 'What', 'more', 'important', 'get', 'spirit', 'characters', 'right', 'Cedric', 'had', 'spirit', 'Epps', 'had', 'enough', 'Alice', 'Trixie', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'more', 'are', 'secondary', 'players', 'anyway', 'never', 'viewed', 'black', 'Honeymooners', 'viewed', 'updated', 'Honeymooners.This', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'contrary', 'previous', 'poster', 'comment', 'light', 'years', 'better', 'Bewitched', 'updated', 'film', 'version.Recommended', 'light', 'fun', 'night', 'popcorn', 'sofa', 'sweetie']",Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk
936797,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000B6TTAU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[7, 8]","""It's alive!"" The infamous words by Dr. Frankenstein could not even bring back a sitcom that has been dead for over a half a century.  However, director John Schultz gives his best effort to remake the sitcom from 1955 with a new adaptation into the theaters, as he casts Cedric the Entertainer and Mike Epps as his sidekick.  Together with these two comedians, Schultz tries to poke fun of the economical situation of a family, and their attempt to gain the American Dream in a swift and easy manner.  However, nothing is easy or swift, as it sets up a myriad of slapstick situations and silly humor.The film begins to set up the story in New York in the fall of 1999, as Ralph Kramden (Cedric the Entertainer) drives a bus while displaying his dreaming persona.  It also shows how he met his future wife Alice (Gabrielle Union) and his deficient skills in business through a Y2K survival kit.  Six years later, Ralph is still a bad businessman and a bus driver who keeps dreaming of the big deal.  However, his relationship with Alice is no longer as sweet, as it was when he met her for the first time.  Now Ralph has to deal with the responsibilities of being married while he also secretively tries to juggle shady business deals in order to make quick money.  However, whenever the truth catches up with him, and it usually does, Alice throws her wrath over him.Honeymooners' storyline focuses on both Ralph and Alice, but also on their neighbors and friends Ed (Mike Epps) and Trixie (Regina Hall).  Alice and Trixie have decided to buy a duplex before the entrepreneur William Davis (Eric Stoltz) buys the building, but in order to do that they have to have $20,000 within two weeks.  This presents a problem to Ralph, as he has squandered some of their money on a supposedly get-rich-quick deal.  It causes further problems for Ralph, as he and Ed begin to look for another quick deal.  The dumb thing is that they do not understand when they have a good deal, and they do not know what good business is.  When they are lucky to find a sure winner, even then they mess it up.The story is a sad mess moving in a predictable direction and the silly jokes do not make it any better.  Sure, the audience will find opportunity to laugh, but so do people when a stranger tells a funny joke.  In Honeymooners the story feels forced while even the performances feel like a bunch of bad skits put together in order to create something that looks like a storyline.  With a budget of 27 million dollars, it should raise some questions such as why they green light the project, as it still requires a lot of rewriting and reworking.  Maybe in another 50 years, a remake of Honeymooners (2005) will be available that they have been able to revitalize through a proper script that has some life in the story.",1,Flawed Comedy That Did Not Need Revitalization...,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,2803,"['alive', 'infamous', 'words', 'Dr.', 'Frankenstein', 'could', 'not', 'even', 'bring', 'back', 'sitcom', 'been', 'dead', 'half', 'century', 'However', 'director', 'John', 'Schultz', 'best', 'effort', 'remake', 'sitcom', '1955', 'new', 'adaptation', 'theaters', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'sidekick', 'Together', 'two', 'comedians', 'Schultz', 'poke', 'fun', 'economical', 'situation', 'family', 'attempt', 'gain', 'American', 'Dream', 'swift', 'easy', 'manner', 'However', 'nothing', 'easy', 'swift', 'up', 'myriad', 'slapstick', 'situations', 'silly', 'humor.The', 'film', 'begins', 'set', 'up', 'story', 'New', 'York', 'fall', '1999', 'Ralph', 'Kramden', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'bus', 'displaying', 'dreaming', 'persona', 'also', 'how', 'met', 'future', 'wife', 'Alice', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'deficient', 'skills', 'business', 'Y2K', 'survival', 'kit', 'Six', 'years', 'later', 'Ralph', 'still', 'bad', 'businessman', 'bus', 'driver', 'who', 'dreaming', 'big', 'deal', 'However', 'relationship', 'Alice', 'no', 'longer', 'sweet', 'was', 'when', 'met', 'first', 'time', 'Now', 'Ralph', 'deal', 'responsibilities', 'being', 'married', 'also', 'secretively', 'juggle', 'shady', 'business', 'deals', 'order', 'make', 'quick', 'money', 'However', 'whenever', 'truth', 'up', 'usually', 'Alice', 'wrath', 'him.Honeymooners', 'storyline', 'Ralph', 'Alice', 'also', 'neighbors', 'friends', 'Ed', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Trixie', 'Regina', 'Hall', 'Alice', 'Trixie', 'have', 'decided', 'buy', 'duplex', 'entrepreneur', 'William', 'Davis', 'Eric', 'Stoltz', 'building', 'order', 'do', 'have', 'have', '20,000', 'two', 'weeks', 'problem', 'Ralph', 'squandered', 'money', 'supposedly', 'get-rich-quick', 'deal', 'further', 'problems', 'Ralph', 'Ed', 'begin', 'look', 'quick', 'deal', 'dumb', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'when', 'have', 'good', 'deal', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'good', 'business', 'When', 'are', 'lucky', 'find', 'sure', 'winner', 'even', 'then', 'mess', 'up.The', 'story', 'sad', 'mess', 'moving', 'predictable', 'direction', 'silly', 'jokes', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'better', 'Sure', 'audience', 'will', 'find', 'opportunity', 'laugh', 'so', 'do', 'people', 'when', 'stranger', 'funny', 'joke', 'Honeymooners', 'story', 'feels', 'forced', 'even', 'performances', 'feel', 'bunch', 'bad', 'skits', 'put', 'together', 'order', 'create', 'something', 'storyline', 'budget', '27', 'million', 'dollars', 'should', 'raise', 'questions', 'such', 'why', 'green', 'light', 'project', 'still', 'lot', 'rewriting', 'reworking', 'Maybe', '50', 'years', 'remake', 'Honeymooners', '2005', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'revitalize', 'proper', 'script', 'life', 'story']",Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk Honeymooners 2005  Full Chk
936798,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000B6TTAU,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 1]","I have nothing against the idea of turning a classic television show into a theatrical film.  Such films can work in extremely different ways (e.g., ""The Fugitive,"" ""The Brady Bunch,"" Charlie's Angels""), although they are the exception rather than the rule (e.g., ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""The Wild Wild West,"" ""Leave It to Beaver,"" ""Bewitched,"" ""The Dukes of Hazzard,"" ad infinitum).  I also do not objective to recasting such a film with African American actors and can accept that working either when the race reversal is part of the film's dynamic (e.g., ""Guess Who?"") or something that is never commented on, which is what we have here with ""The Honeymooners.""  I prefer the former, but the latter also qualifies as a political statement in that just accepting Cedric the Entertainer as Ralph Kramden says something.I understand that there are plenty of people who are offended by the idea of ANYBODY playing Ralph besides Jackie Gleason, and once the Great One has been recast you know something is going to try and commit the ultimate outrage and remake ""I Love Lucy.""  But Ralph Kramden represents an archetypal character as the incompetent head of the family.  Remember that the 1950s were the time of Jim Anderson on ""Father Knows Best"" and Ward Cleaver on ""Leave it to Beaver.""  It is Ralph Kramden who serves as the link between those edifices of fatherly wisdom and the likes of Archie Bunker and Homer Simpson, and if they keep letting new people play Hamlet and Superman, then Cedric can try wearing Jackie's pants.That being said, my problem with ""The Honeymooners"" has to do with the script much more than the performers.  Fifty years later he classic situation comedy has been turned into a romantic comedy, albeit one in which the couple are married a couple of minutes into the film.  In fact, I though the film's prologue got this 2005 comedy off on the wrong foot in several key ways.  ""The Honeymooners"" became in media res, with Ralph and Alice ""happily"" married, if constant bickering constitutes some form of happiness.  Part of the mystery is why these two were married in the first place.  But the screenplay begins with Ralph and Alice (Gabrielle Union) meeting and him trying to impress her.  Apparently he does, although neither the dance he does nor his Y2K Survival Kit are capable of doing the job.  The next thing we know Ralph and Alice are married and yelling at each other.  Under the circumstances set up here this strikes me as tragic rather than as funny.This is not to say that a couple cannot fight and still love each other.  Just watch ""Gilmore Girls"" when Luke and Lorelai go at each other.  But the prologue makes it seem like these two should not be fighting.  I also think there is a major casting problem with Alice because Gabrielle Union is simply too fine for Cedric.  Remember: he does not do anything in the prologue to suggest he is not as selfish as she accuses him of being when things come to a head in the film over Ralph's attempts to strike it rich.  Ralph COULD be loveable, but given what we see from the start of this film to pretty near the end, he simply is NOT.  At best, he stops being selfish and only has some minimal notion of what it would mean to move in the other direction.  This time around Alice and Trixie (Regina Hall) are both more interesting, and I was hoping that maybe they would become actively involved in making things work out, but that did not be the case.  I also thought that the villain played by Eric Stoltz would amount to something specific, but he ended up being a one-dimensional figure, and while John Leguizamo is always worth watching, why let him upstage Ed Norton (Mike Epps), who is supposed to spend his time upstaging Ralph?  Can you name a guest star who ever stole a scene from either Jackie Gleason or Art Carney?The script here is written by Danny Jacobson (""Roseanne""), David Sheffield (""The Nutty Professor"") and Barry W. Blaustein (""Coming to America""), and Don Rhymer (""Big Mama's House"").  Seeing that many writers on a film is usually not a good thing, and ultimately my objection to the film is that everything is by the numbers.  Ralph is the anti-Midas, so that all of his best laid plans to make a quick buck will fail, either because they were stupid in the first place, Ed finds a way of messing them up, or simply the gods look down and laugh (which is more than the audience does for most of this film).  The happy ending is not so much a contrivance as it is uninspiring.  This film wants to have a heart, but it needs to be better connected to a better brain for it to really work.  You cannot accuse these actors of not showing proper respect for those who came before them, but you can fault the writers for not coming up with something worthy of the Gleason-Carney-Meadows-Randolph legacy (and the producers for not insisting on it [and director John Schults (""Like Mike"") for not recognizing it was not here]).",2,An inoffensive but flawed remake

It seems like these highly talented actors were misplaced in the wrong movie. And they didn't seem to be having fun in it either. The Honeymoners is an ancient show to begin with. A remake given it's proper due of this series is pretty difficult material to tackle. To make it funny for today's audiences seems next to impossible regardless of what ethnic group or race the actors are. It's just not as funny as it once was. It would be the same as some director doing a Three Stooges remake. Some things just shouldn't be done over or dug up again. In regards to this film. It would've helped if it was funny. The audiences of today have high expectations often to a fault. I tried to like this movie though and Cedric the Entertainer is very talented and funny when he is given decent material to work with.

Despite Ralph's many get-rich-quick schemes/motivational speaker tape series, they've managed to save some money and, along with their best friends Ed and Trixie Norton, they seem to have almost enough money for a down payment on a Brooklyn duplex. However, when Ralph decides to try to impress Alice by making up what he's lost and augmenting their savings with another of his crazy schemes, he winds up losing all their money and his marriage to boot and it takes all his determination and love for Alice to get things on track again. The movie itself is quite entertaining and Cedric, Mike Epps, and John Leguizamo gave very funny and likable performances. This movie accomplishes everything a good comedy should- genuine performances, good casting, fun and comical storyline, and a slew of good jokes.
