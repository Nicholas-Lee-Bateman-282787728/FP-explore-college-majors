While most documentaries take few risks and present talking heads, Ross McElwee dares to tell a subjective, off-the-wall story of  loneliness and love, using Sherman's March to the Sea as an outline. Funny,  insightful, and full of rich characterizations (except these people are the  real deal), this film needs to be seen by a new generation of film lovers.  Despite its 2 1/2 hour length, it is brisk and I must say, I was NEVER  bored. Quite simply, a brilliant charmer.",5,An absolute original......,926726400,"05 15, 1999",1999,556,"['was', 'glad', 'finally', 'locate', 'underground', 'classic', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'most', 'documentaries', 'take', 'few', 'risks', 'present', 'talking', 'heads', 'Ross', 'McElwee', 'tell', 'subjective', 'off-the-wall', 'story', 'loneliness', 'love', 'using', 'Sherman', 'March', 'Sea', 'outline', 'Funny', 'insightful', 'full', 'rich', 'characterizations', 'people', 'are', 'real', 'deal', 'film', 'be', 'seen', 'new', 'generation', 'film', 'lovers', '2', '1/2', 'hour', 'length', 'brisk', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'NEVER', 'bored', 'Quite', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'charmer']",N/A
300841,A2R5VKE4YO966D,6302199697,Charles Curtis,"[1, 1]","Ross McElwee spends the early 1980's muddled in the aftermath of a break up with a Yankee girl from up in New York, half heartedly attempting to make a documentary about Sherman's March to the Sea. He gets mired in it, losing inspiration, and begins shooting footage of other things, mostly the series of women he encounters; ones whom his officious friends and family set him up with, or that he otherwise meets and becomes attracted to. This side footage apparently finally gains critical mass, and his project diverges from his previously intended path..To the point that his meandering journey through the south following Sherman's trail becomes a pretext for him to encounter women, and examine his own love life. ""It seems that I'm filming my life in order to have a life to film..""On his travels McElwee interacts with (and often dates) a representative series of women - his long lost puppy love with a Dorothy Hamill hairdo who is happily married to another man but still flirtatiously entertains his filmed questioning, an obnoxious aspiring actress who thinks she is the second coming of Brooke Shields, an earnest Southern Baptist woman who brings him into contact with the Moral Majority and Redneck Proto-Tea Party Types (""The gummint damn well better just leave us alone, *snarl*..""), a hippy chick fleeing grad work in linguistics to milk cows and keep bees out on the Carolina Cape, an over earnest anti-nuclear activist whom he had once dated but has dumped him for someone else, a starry eyed teacher at an exclusive Southern girls' academy who turns out to be a true blue Cleon Skousen variety Mormon (""we strongly believe that the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are inspired of God..""), a southern girl rocker doing her .38 Special/Janis Joplin kick, a former lover defense attorney who is a pro- ERA activist, and so on, so forth..All of which results in this intimately rambling, mildly fascinating look back on Regan's America. It seems nothing ever really changes. Certainly not human nature. The paradigm was set, it forever remains the same..Because all the Civil War history and then contemporary culture end up a backdrop to the true focus of this film, which is a self portrait of ambivalent, frustrated male desire: McElwee's diffident reaction to the dating scene in the American South in the mid 1980's. The theme of potential nuclear apocalypse (which McElwee confesses being haunted by in his dreams) and the periodic intrusion of Burt Reynolds into the storyline give thematic unity and jazz up things, acting as foils provoking and illustrating McElwee's anxiety and inadequacies.As for General Sherman: McElwee clearly identifies with him somehow, in that he clearly sees resonances in his life with his - Until his great military success, Sherman had been more or less a failure. Sherman also had spent some of the happiest years of his life in Charleston and New Orleans before the war, only to become the great bete noire of the South when he brought total war against them. He quotes and praises Sherman's descriptions of battle as being beautifully written, and mentions how the general had been a painter of landscapes and portraits, clearly identifying with Sherman as an artist. McElwee in his fecklessness and frustration, professional and romantic, makes repeated explicit reference to how he thinks he and the general are some how similar, without explaining exactly what he means.. I think McElwee means to ironically style himself as a romantic ravisher of Southern womanhood, while expressing his alienation from his own identity as a southerner. He  seems to be clearly seeking a cathartic breakthrough where he can triumph like Sherman did.Which it appears he finally does.. McElwee is somehow like Camus's Meursault, but instead of killing an Arab, he just goes back to film school and then on another date. And puts out a bunch of documentaries, beginning with this one. Which of course is just a hipster variation off how we Americans more commonly express and cope with our existentialist angst.. Which is more typically through the making and watching television sitcoms.",4,"""Don't You See the Resemblance Between Sherman and Me?""",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,4148,"['Ross', 'McElwee', 'early', '1980', 'muddled', 'aftermath', 'break', 'up', 'Yankee', 'girl', 'New', 'York', 'half', 'heartedly', 'attempting', 'make', 'documentary', 'Sherman', 'March', 'Sea', 'mired', 'losing', 'inspiration', 'shooting', 'footage', 'other', 'things', 'mostly', 'series', 'women', 'ones', 'whom', 'officious', 'friends', 'family', 'set', 'up', 'otherwise', 'meets', 'becomes', 'attracted', 'side', 'footage', 'apparently', 'finally', 'gains', 'critical', 'mass', 'project', 'previously', 'intended', 'path..To', 'point', 'meandering', 'journey', 'south', 'following', 'Sherman', 'trail', 'pretext', 'encounter', 'women', 'examine', 'own', 'love', 'life', ""'m"", 'filming', 'life', 'order', 'have', 'life', 'film..', 'travels', 'McElwee', 'interacts', 'often', 'dates', 'representative', 'series', 'women', 'long', 'lost', 'puppy', 'love', 'Dorothy', 'Hamill', 'hairdo', 'who', 'happily', 'married', 'man', 'still', 'flirtatiously', 'filmed', 'questioning', 'obnoxious', 'aspiring', 'actress', 'who', 'second', 'coming', 'Brooke', 'Shields', 'earnest', 'Southern', 'Baptist', 'woman', 'who', 'contact', 'Moral', 'Majority', 'Redneck', 'Proto-Tea', 'Party', 'Types', 'gummint', 'damn', 'well', 'better', 'just', 'leave', 'alone', '*snarl*..', 'hippy', 'chick', 'fleeing', 'grad', 'work', 'linguistics', 'milk', 'cows', 'keep', 'bees', 'out', 'Carolina', 'Cape', 'earnest', 'anti-nuclear', 'activist', 'whom', 'had', 'once', 'dated', 'dumped', 'someone', 'else', 'starry', 'eyed', 'teacher', 'exclusive', 'Southern', 'girls', 'academy', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'true', 'blue', 'Cleon', 'Skousen', 'variety', 'Mormon', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Constitution', 'Declaration', 'Independence', 'are', 'inspired', 'God..', 'southern', 'girl', 'rocker', 'doing', '.38', 'Special/Janis', 'Joplin', 'kick', 'former', 'lover', 'defense', 'attorney', 'who', 'pro-', 'ERA', 'activist', 'so', 'forth..All', 'results', 'intimately', 'rambling', 'mildly', 'fascinating', 'look', 'back', 'Regan', 'America', 'nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'changes', 'Certainly', 'not', 'human', 'nature', 'paradigm', 'was', 'set', 'forever', 'same..Because', 'Civil', 'War', 'history', 'then', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'end', 'up', 'backdrop', 'true', 'focus', 'film', 'self', 'portrait', 'ambivalent', 'frustrated', 'male', 'desire', 'McElwee', 'diffident', 'reaction', 'dating', 'scene', 'American', 'South', 'mid', '1980', 'theme', 'potential', 'nuclear', 'apocalypse', 'McElwee', 'being', 'haunted', 'dreams', 'periodic', 'intrusion', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'storyline', 'give', 'thematic', 'unity', 'jazz', 'up', 'things', 'acting', 'foils', 'provoking', 'illustrating', 'McElwee', 'anxiety', 'inadequacies.As', 'General', 'Sherman', 'McElwee', 'clearly', 'identifies', 'somehow', 'clearly', 'resonances', 'life', 'great', 'military', 'success', 'Sherman', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'less', 'failure', 'Sherman', 'also', 'had', 'spent', 'happiest', 'years', 'life', 'Charleston', 'New', 'Orleans', 'war', 'only', 'become', 'great', 'bete', 'noire', 'South', 'when', 'brought', 'total', 'war', 'Sherman', 'descriptions', 'battle', 'being', 'beautifully', 'written', 'mentions', 'how', 'general', 'had', 'been', 'painter', 'landscapes', 'portraits', 'clearly', 'identifying', 'Sherman', 'artist', 'McElwee', 'fecklessness', 'frustration', 'professional', 'romantic', 'repeated', 'explicit', 'reference', 'how', 'general', 'are', 'how', 'similar', 'explaining', 'exactly', 'what', 'means..', 'think', 'McElwee', 'ironically', 'style', 'romantic', 'ravisher', 'Southern', 'womanhood', 'expressing', 'alienation', 'own', 'identity', 'southerner', 'be', 'clearly', 'seeking', 'cathartic', 'breakthrough', 'where', 'can', 'triumph', 'Sherman', 'did.Which', 'finally', 'does..', 'McElwee', 'somehow', 'like', 'Camus', 'Meursault', 'instead', 'killing', 'Arab', 'just', 'back', 'film', 'school', 'then', 'date', 'out', 'bunch', 'documentaries', 'beginning', 'one', 'Which', 'course', 'just', 'hipster', 'variation', 'how', 'Americans', 'more', 'commonly', 'express', 'cope', 'existentialist', 'angst..', 'Which', 'more', 'typically', 'making', 'watching', 'television', 'sitcoms']",N/A
300842,A86GTYQ4MZB73,6302199697,"hermione31 ""hermione""","[12, 36]","Considered by many to be a classic in the genre, Sherman's March is the 155 minute personal contemplation of filmmaker, Ross McElwee, regarding his love-life. Though he originally intended to make a documentary about the Northern Civil War's General William Tecumseh Sherman, a figure still much-loathed in the South, instead he cranks out a ponderous study of his romantic dealings with various Southern women.McElwee's film is not without charm. There is a very funny subplot regarding Burt Reynolds that culminates in a hilarious encounter on the set of The Cannonball Run. And McElwee is not without self-insight into his own sad-sack existence. But ultimately, his film suffers from the fact that he has made a terrible mistake as a documentarian: his has made himself the subject, and he is not intrinsically interesting.McElwee could have succeeded in making some sort of study on the war of the sexes or a wry comedy of errors, but his total solipsism prevents the audience from ever really thinking about anything but him. What makes it worse is that McElwee is a problematic protagonist. One can clearly read how he wants to come off, but I, a single woman, found his transparency off-putting. Instead of being witty, he's pedantic. Instead of being thoughtful, he's so wrapped up in these silly encounters that any intelligent woman watching cannot but help but conclude that McElwee is shooting his own foot. He is attracted to stupid and terrible women who are totally without character or depth.A strange combination of pretention and yet utter superficiality characterize both McElwee and his film.

I was fascinated by the characters, and the by the not-so-subtle way in which the intellectual pursuits of a scholar are subordinated to his personal life and hang-ups.  As an academic who is often painfully aware of the overlap between my life and my work it was refreshing to see this overlap admitted so openly -- even embraced  to the point where it becomes the subject matter of the entire investigation.My wife, on the other hand, was bothered by what she saw as Mr. McElwee's pretentiousness, and his ""exploitation"" of the women in the film.  It is true that all of them were more or less willing participants -- and a commmon feature of each of them was that they were in some way entertainers who were interested in being seen -- still, she thought, the very fact that they revealed themselves and he could step back and observe and judge set up what she saw as an unequal situation.  Having said that, she did admit that the film held an undeniable fascination for her.As it turned out, we talked about the film on and off for the next few days, even comparing people we know and ourselves to the characters revealed there.  That is, I think, one of the signs that the film was effective.  In a time when most films, and certainly to my mind all of reality TV, are forgettable, this film is not.  I think Mr. McElwee sets himself up to be vulnerable to the criticisms my wife suggests -- and does not shy away from them.  As a character, and as narrator of his own story, he is neither hero nor villian but is a real person, and that is what makes his stories interesting.I can't wait to see the other films he has made -- like Time Indefinite and, most recently, Bright Leaves that is currently in (selected) theatres.",5,I'll take this over reality TV anytime!,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,1819,"['saw', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'wife', 'reactions', 'were', 'mixed', 'loved', 'was', 'fascinated', 'characters', 'not-so-subtle', 'way', 'intellectual', 'pursuits', 'scholar', 'are', 'subordinated', 'personal', 'life', 'hang-ups', 'academic', 'who', 'often', 'painfully', 'aware', 'overlap', 'life', 'work', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'overlap', 'admitted', 'so', 'openly', 'even', 'embraced', 'point', 'where', 'subject', 'matter', 'entire', 'investigation.My', 'wife', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'bothered', 'what', 'saw', 'Mr.', 'McElwee', 'pretentiousness', 'exploitation', 'women', 'film', 'true', 'were', 'more', 'less', 'willing', 'participants', 'commmon', 'feature', 'was', 'were', 'way', 'entertainers', 'who', 'were', 'interested', 'being', 'seen', 'still', 'thought', 'very', 'fact', 'revealed', 'could', 'step', 'back', 'observe', 'judge', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'saw', 'unequal', 'situation', 'Having', 'said', 'did', 'admit', 'film', 'held', 'undeniable', 'fascination', 'her.As', 'turned', 'out', 'talked', 'film', 'next', 'few', 'days', 'even', 'comparing', 'people', 'know', 'characters', 'revealed', 'there', 'think', 'one', 'signs', 'film', 'was', 'effective', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'certainly', 'mind', 'reality', 'TV', 'are', 'forgettable', 'film', 'not', 'think', 'Mr.', 'McElwee', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'criticisms', 'wife', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'character', 'narrator', 'own', 'story', 'hero', 'villian', 'real', 'person', 'what', 'stories', 'interesting.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'other', 'films', 'made', 'Time', 'Indefinite', 'most', 'recently', 'Bright', 'currently', 'selected', 'theatres']",N/A

300846,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6302199697,Randy Keehn,"[1, 5]","I recently read the book ""Sherman's March"" which was the first detailed account I had read of the famous episode in the Civil War.  It was interesting and I thought that the movie of the same name might give me some visual background to the event.  I was a bit confused when I read the brief synopsis of the film.  It seemed to suggest that this was the story of a lost jilted lover who was afraid of a nuclear Holocaust.  When I sat down to watch the rented DVD, I was subjected to the jilted lover story as expected but I figured that I would eventually get to the Civil War events especially because the movie is 2 1/2 hours long.  Unfortunately, this pathetic director/cameraman unloads an endless barrage of personal self-inflicted depression.  My wife, who tolerates my esoteric choices in films (so long as she can be in another room at the time) even wondered aloud ""What on Earth are you watching?""  I explained that the movie would eventually get to Sherman's March especially because the movie is 2 1/2 hours long.  She offered the suggestion that I quit now and cut my losses.  I deferred because I knew that the movie would eventually get to Sherman's March especially because the movie is 2 1/2 hours long.  In time, after a snippet here and there, I realized I was being duped by the film's title and rather overwhelmed by the 2 1/2 hours.  In all, there probably isn't more than 5-10 minutes in reference to Sherman's March.  There was plenty about the many loves of our fearful loser.I was bothered by my unmet expectations of this movie (and the 2 1/2 hours I wasted).  I knew that there was something else going on in the movie but I had expected that this would intersperced with the actual filming of a documentary and in realitvely equal parts.  As my daughter PJ would say, ""My bad.""  I was ready to rate this film ""1 star"" but I found myself reflecting on the oddly appealing account of a doofus who can't miss while losing.  His multiple affairs with old friends and new strangers becomes rather enjoyable at times (not all the 2 1/2 hours but, at times).  What reached out to me was the impression that this was a real-life, unscripted, on-film account of his escapades.  I don't know if it was truely unscripted but the fact that I think that it might be is a testiment to the director's ability.  This was like a modern Henry James version of a reality TV show.  I don't watch those things since I appreciate that living in my reality is entertainment enough.  However, I could see a sort of allure to watching other people stumbling along the same way we do.  There is a lady who serves as a matchmaker in the second half of this move and she is worth at least a portion of the price of admission.  Her approach towards match-making is more the 50-yard dash than the long distance runner.  ""Here's someone just right for you and now that you've met her, the wedding will be in December"".  If that fails, she'll have you ready for the wedding with a different bride instead.The biggest problem ""Sherman's March"" has is that it is way too long.  The director, Ross McElwee, is no film editor.  No matter what you're looking for in this film, it's just too long.  By the way, I noticed that Burt Reynolds is listed as the star.  If you want to see this movie in order to watch Burt Reynolds, go back over this review and substitute Burt Reynolds where I wrote Sherman's March (other than the film title) and, instead of 5-10 minutes, insert 10-20 seconds.

300847,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302199697,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Sherman's March (Ross McElwee, 1986)Say all you want about equality of the sexes, but as much as we deny it, the simple fact of the matter is that when guys do things, most of the time we have one goal in mind: getting laid. Whether we know it or not. I have no idea if Ross McElwee started making Sherman's March, originally a documentary about, well, Sherman's March, with the idea of getting laid. I do know, however, that his obsession with the topic kept him from making the film he wanted to, and ended him up with this delightful, charming, irreverent look at the fairer sex, both those he finds himself in relationships with and those (most notably, of course, his mother) who try to get him into relationships. It's still a documentary, just one of an entirely different sort.I should note from the outset that this is a movie one has to be in a certain frame of mind to appreciate; it wouldn't work at all if it were not for McElwee's sense of humor, which is both very dry and self-deprecating almost to a fault; this is not a movie to watch when one is depressed, for it will certainly not cheer you up. But despite both that and its length, which is outrageous when considered in the American frame of reference (though right up the alley of, say, Bollywood), once you've gotten interested in Sherman's March, there's no going back. You'll be staying with McElwee until the bitter end.

300848,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302199697,Robert Moore,"[16, 16]","As the subtitle of this marvelous documentary (?) hints, this is a wildly improbable movie.  There actually is little that one can say about the content of it, since its substance lies in its execution and collection of odd and bizarre moments, not in what it has to say.  Ross McElwee obtains a grant to make a documentary about the lingering effects of Sherman's march through Georgia in the Civil War, but instead keeps getting sidetracked and obsessed by women he meets along the way.  Occasionally it occurs to him that he ought to stop shooting film of the women he yearns for and start worrying about Sherman, but he never can quite force his attention in that direction.  The movie may start off as a documentary on SHERMAN'S MARCH, but it morphs quite rapidly in the film's subtitle:  AN IMPROBABLE SEARCH FOR LOVE.I'm not quite sure that this film can truly be categorized as a documentary:  it is more of a confessional, an exploration of the McElwee's desire for love.  I think it will feel uncomfortably familiar for many of its viewers in a way that a fictional account of the search for love could never be.",5,A wonderful curve ball of a film,1092787200,"08 18, 2004",2004,1122,"['subtitle', 'marvelous', 'documentary', 'hints', 'wildly', 'improbable', 'movie', 'actually', 'little', 'one', 'can', 'say', 'content', 'substance', 'execution', 'collection', 'odd', 'bizarre', 'moments', 'not', 'what', 'say', 'Ross', 'McElwee', 'grant', 'make', 'documentary', 'lingering', 'effects', 'Sherman', 'march', 'Georgia', 'Civil', 'War', 'instead', 'getting', 'sidetracked', 'obsessed', 'women', 'way', 'Occasionally', 'ought', 'stop', 'shooting', 'film', 'women', 'start', 'worrying', 'Sherman', 'never', 'can', 'quite', 'force', 'attention', 'direction', 'movie', 'may', 'start', 'off', 'documentary', 'SHERMAN', 'MARCH', 'quite', 'rapidly', 'film', 'subtitle', 'AN', 'IMPROBABLE', 'SEARCH', 'FOR', 'LOVE.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'film', 'can', 'truly', 'be', 'categorized', 'documentary', 'more', 'confessional', 'exploration', 'McElwee', 'desire', 'love', 'think', 'will', 'feel', 'uncomfortably', 'familiar', 'many', 'viewers', 'way', 'fictional', 'account', 'search', 'love', 'could', 'never', 'be']",N/A

300850,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302199697,Westley,"[11, 20]","""Sherman's March"" is an unusual, somewhat loopy documentary.  North Carolinian filmmaker Ross McElwee originally set out to do a fairly serious examination of how General Sherman's Civil War campaign has continued to affect life in the South.  However, right before shooting started, McElwee's girlfriend broke up with him.  This event lead McElwee to completely reconsider the documentary, especially as he started to travel across the South and trace Sherman's march.  He soon finds himself being perpetually set-up with women by family and friends.The film ends up somewhat unexpectedly focusing far more on southern women than it does General Sherman.  Don't watch this film hoping to gain more knowledge about Sherman -- you'll be disappointed.  However, if you enjoy documentaries about real people and relationships, then you'll probably appreciate ""Sherman's March.""  I had mixed feelings about the film, mostly because I had conflicting feelings about McElwee and the women he wooed.  McElwee is a fairly likeable sadsack, but we really don't get to know much about him.  In addition, he seems pretty clueless about how to choose a partner for himself.  Most of the women highlighted are eccentric or downright unlikeable, such as Pat who is obsessed with meeting Burt Reynolds and becoming a star.  However, perhaps the message is that when you're in your 30s and looking for a partner, you might have to kiss a few frogs in the process.""Sherman's March"" is filled with genial humor.  However, the film is unfocused, repetitive, and overlong by at least 40 minutes.  I also found the subjects annoying after awhile.
