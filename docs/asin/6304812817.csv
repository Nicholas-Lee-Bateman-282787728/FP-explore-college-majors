436082,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6304812817,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","ARE YOU BEING SERVED? was a popular BBC television comedy series that mixed broad farce and double entendre in its on-going depiction of employees at a large London department store.  The original series ran from 1972 to 1985 and ultimately became very popular in the United States through PBS broadcasts.  Although the cast changed from time to time, the ""classic"" line-up featured Ladies Wear sales clerks Mrs. Slocombe (Mollie Sugden) and Miss Brahams (Wendy Richard); Men's Wear sales clerks Mr. Grainger (Arthur Bough), Mr. Humphries (John Inman), and Mr. Lucas (Trevor Bannister.)  Management was represented by floor supervisor Capt. Peacock (Frank Thornton), manager Mr. Rumbold (Nicholas Smith), and store owner ""young"" Mr. Grace (Harold Bennett.)  Maintenance was embodied by Mr. Harmon (Arthur English.)  Each episode found the characters in unexpectedly bizarre situations that arose from everything from cold weather to stuck elevators to a general strike, often with doing battle with difficult customers, and always doing battle with each other.Apparently it is not unusual for a BBC series to be adapted into a feature film during the series run, and it is this particular cast the 1977 feature film uses.  The movie finds Grace Brothers closing for major renovations--and the department staff taking a group vacation for the two weeks the renovations will require.  They go to the fictional Costa Plonka, only to find that the hotel does not have rooms for them.  They are assigned to separate tents as a temporary measure--and Mr. Lucas writes a sexy note to Miss Brahams that goes astray, falling into the hands of Mrs. Slocombe, who assumes the note has been sent to her by Captain Peacock.  Confusion reigns as various characters chase each other in and out of tents through the night, and then overflows when a revolution breaks out the next morning, leaving everyone stranded and in fear for their lives.  But this is ARE YOU BEING SERVED? so we know everything will turn out all right in the end.Someone who hasn't seen the series is unlikely to enjoy the movie, which relies heavily on prior knowledge; at the same time, quite a few people who have seen the series seem to dislike the film as unoriginal and lacking the fun of the original.  I have to say that over all I found it very small beer--but there are worse ways to spend an hour an half.  Series fans who don't expect too much will likely enjoy it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3,"""I Am Unanimous in This!""",1404432000,"07 4, 2014",2014,2454,"['ARE', 'YOU', 'BEING', 'SERVED', 'was', 'popular', 'BBC', 'television', 'comedy', 'series', 'mixed', 'broad', 'farce', 'double', 'entendre', 'on-going', 'depiction', 'employees', 'large', 'London', 'department', 'store', 'original', 'series', 'ran', '1972', '1985', 'ultimately', 'became', 'very', 'popular', 'United', 'States', 'PBS', 'broadcasts', 'cast', 'changed', 'time', 'time', 'classic', 'line-up', 'featured', 'Ladies', 'Wear', 'sales', 'clerks', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'Mollie', 'Sugden', 'Miss', 'Brahams', 'Wendy', 'Richard', 'Men', 'Wear', 'sales', 'Mr.', 'Grainger', 'Arthur', 'Bough', 'Mr.', 'Humphries', 'John', 'Inman', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'Trevor', 'Bannister', 'Management', 'was', 'represented', 'floor', 'supervisor', 'Capt', 'Peacock', 'Frank', 'Thornton', 'manager', 'Mr.', 'Rumbold', 'Nicholas', 'Smith', 'store', 'owner', 'young', 'Mr.', 'Grace', 'Harold', 'Bennett', 'Maintenance', 'was', 'embodied', 'Mr.', 'Harmon', 'Arthur', 'English', 'episode', 'found', 'characters', 'unexpectedly', 'bizarre', 'situations', 'arose', 'everything', 'cold', 'weather', 'stuck', 'elevators', 'general', 'strike', 'often', 'doing', 'battle', 'difficult', 'customers', 'always', 'doing', 'battle', 'other.Apparently', 'not', 'unusual', 'BBC', 'series', 'be', 'adapted', 'feature', 'film', 'series', 'run', 'particular', 'cast', '1977', 'feature', 'film', 'movie', 'Grace', 'Brothers', 'closing', 'major', 'renovations', 'department', 'staff', 'taking', 'group', 'vacation', 'two', 'weeks', 'renovations', 'will', 'require', 'go', 'fictional', 'Costa', 'Plonka', 'only', 'find', 'hotel', 'not', 'have', 'rooms', 'are', 'assigned', 'separate', 'tents', 'temporary', 'measure', 'Mr.', 'Lucas', 'sexy', 'note', 'Miss', 'Brahams', 'astray', 'falling', 'hands', 'Mrs.', 'Slocombe', 'who', 'note', 'been', 'sent', 'Captain', 'Peacock', 'Confusion', 'various', 'characters', 'chase', 'other', 'tents', 'night', 'then', 'when', 'revolution', 'out', 'next', 'morning', 'leaving', 'everyone', 'stranded', 'fear', 'lives', 'ARE', 'YOU', 'BEING', 'SERVED', 'know', 'everything', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'right', 'end.Someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'unlikely', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'heavily', 'prior', 'knowledge', 'same', 'time', 'quite', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'seem', 'dislike', 'film', 'unoriginal', 'lacking', 'fun', 'original', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'very', 'small', 'beer', 'are', 'worse', 'ways', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'Series', 'fans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'it.GFT', 'Amazon', 'Reviewer']",Are You Being Served?

436084,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,6304812817,Get What We Give,"[101, 118]","First of all, let me say that I am American and ""Are You Being Served? (the t.v. series) is one of my all time favorite shows.  It is rife with clever humor, memorable characters, excellent actors, wonderful innuendo, and often sharp writing.This movie is not.Possibly the biggest mistake is taking the characters out of their natural element:  Grace Brothers Department Store.  Granted, at the time, the writers must have thought they needed to do so in order to expand the scope for a film.  I'm sure that they were correct, in part.  But the way in which they took the characters out of the store is pitifully lacking.Grumpy, tipsey Mrs. Slocumb; fey Mr. Humphreys; superior Captain Peacock; dottering Mr. Grainger; sexy but common Miss Brahms; randy Mr. Lucas; and jug-eared Mr. Rumbold are very lovable and very loved characters.  Add in cockney and sly Mr. Harmon and you've got a recipe for hilarity.Sadly ""The Movie"" doesn't really deliver on that.  The beginning of the movie is the funniest - it is set in the department store.  It is also slightly surreal as we are introduced to the characters as if we were seeing them for the first time and as if they didn't already have a history with each other.  (Since the movie is a spin-off of the highly popular television series, this introduction seems unwarranted).The premise is that the store must close and Mr. Grace has sprung for a vacation for the department to go to Costa Plonka in Spain.  Sound familiar?  Of course it does.  It was a premise of one of the episodes.  Once there the staff is relegated to staying in tents in the garden of the hotel.  Sound familiar?  It's another episode.  (the whole Mrs. Slocumb and the flatulant air mattress is even included). Mr. Humphrey's dons women's clothing; and Mr. Harmon outsmarts everyone.Basically what I'm saying is that there is no real new material here......except for the finale....and that ain't good news.Why, oh why, anyone would find it funny having a revolutionary general beginning his insurrection in the hotel?  Not only does it not make a lick of sense pragmatically, but comically it is the death knell for the movie.There is one thing that the movie did that the series never did:  Mr. Humphreys is definitely gay in the movie, but it was always a source of fun speculation in the series.  It's a mistake.Though written by the same writers as the series, it seems to have taken all the things that were wrong in the series and used them to make the film.  Gone is the banter at the ubiquitous ""staff meetings"" or the ""canteen lunches"".  Instead, the writers miss the chance at an al fresco dinner to do the same.  Mr. Grainger was always a source of hilarity with his dottering ways - and yet here he's almost written as an afterthought.I don't understand the mistake with this movie.  In 1977 the series was still in production and was quite funny.  What happened here?  I speculate that the writers didn't have the time to really give the time necessary to the film.I bought this DVD without having ever seen the film.  I don't regret it as it is part of what I consider my AYBS collection, but if you want to get your first taste of this phenonomenal series by seeing the movie first - DON'T!

In this case they were expanding on an idea from the TV show where the staff are told they will have to take a vacation together. The problem with the film is two fold.First the actors are out of their usual element and while trying the jokes and routines seemed forced, the set up, a revolution breaks out in the banana republic to which they've gone, is so stupidly over the top that you can't suspend disbelief.Secondly the production values are dreadful. What works in a TV show, a set of a department store, does not when you're told you're looking at a hotel in the tropics. I was reminded of sets from the old Carol Burnett variety show, and I'd like to apologize to Ms. Burnett for the likeness.Overall this was nothing but a money grab, playing on the popularity of Are you Being Served the producers grabbed beloved characters and instead of taking advantage of the longer playing time and possible production capablities to make a super episode, one feels they did the thing on the cheap and the characters suffer by comparrison.I love Are You Being Served and it's sequal, Grace and Favor, AKA Are You Being Served Again, but this is so not worth it. It is not up to the standard of the show or the ability of the actors. Go watch the episode where they plan a holiday together.

436105,A33WROIMGXTYMW,6304812817,"Lee Freeman ""lfreeman_histgen""","[6, 8]","""Are You Being Served? The Movie"" had enormous potential; sadly the film didn't manage to reach that potential. Instead of putting our favorite staff members from Grace Bros. into new situations Lloyd and Croft simply re-worked several former episodes, such as ""A Change is as Good as a Rest"" and ""Dear Sexy Knickers."" Add to this the oft-used-in-the-series plot device of the closing of the store and the staff going on holiday (in this case to Costa Plonka), paid for by the Head of the Firm Young Mr. Grace; though they used this idea of the store closing for renovations and Young Mr. Grace copping for the staff to go on holiday in the interim a couple of times in the series, they never actually did an episode where we actually saw the staff on holiday, thus it could have worked in the Movie if done differently.Nevertheless the first half of the film is fairly good in spite of the re-used gags and plot-devices; we get to see a bit more of the store, such as a view of the Ladies' and Gents' Dept. from the lift looking down the stairs (a view which if memory serves we never got to see in the series); the photo booth; and the Continental Beauty Salon-though where was the famed Madame Beryl? I'm not sure how the film, containing these re-worked plot elements, would fit into a timeline of the series. Perhaps the producers Lloyd and Croft were trying to appeal to audiences unfamiliar with the series.The abscence of a laugh track was interesting, though admittedly a laugh track might have helped the film which drags during much of the hotel scenes.

436112,A30Q8X8B1S3GGT,6304812817,"Mark Savary ""moon_city""","[10, 12]","This is the 1977 movie version of that venerable old Britcom, ""Are You Being Served?"", the staple of so many public television pledge drives. Deservedly so, for the series is hilarious even after multiple viewings.After 1977, several cast changes occurred on the show, including the loss of Young Mr. Grace, old Churchill-esque Mr. Granger, and worst of all, the randy Mr. Lucas. Each was replaced on the show by a series of less-than-adequate stand-ins. So in a way, the movie serves as a snapshot of the series up to that point. It was at this time that the cast was both the best and at it's peak.In the story, Grace Brothers is closing for remodeling. The only way to get the entire staff to agree to take their vacations at the same time is for Mr. Grace to provide holiday packages for each department.While the film is a fun romp, it just isn't up to the standards of a typical episode. The cast certainly tries their best, and a lot of mileage is gotten out of John Inman's character, Mr. Humphries. Trevor Bannister is also in top form as the swinging Mr. Lucas, as is the rest of our much-loved cast.But, something is just not quite right.The first problem the fan may notice is that, without the live audience (and even to a degree, taping the action on video), the ambiance of the show is somewhat missing from the film. Think of watching your favorite sitcom without a laugh track... it's just strange.Second, we've seen some of these routines before (the ""Dear Sexy Knickers"" letter, for instance). Happily, this sort of rehashing of material is kept to a minimum, and is understandable since the routines were so popular.Third, and probably most damaging, is that the cast is removed from their natural environment, Grace Brothers' Department Store. Only the first ten minutes or so are placed in the store with what looks like similar (but not original), sets from the show (in fact, the sets look strangely even more cheap than the ones used for TV!). The balance of the film is set in Costa Plonka, a banana republic holiday resort perpetually in a state of revolution.All in all, it just doesn't work. The movie, on the whole, turns out to be both fun and somewhat flat. Removing the cast from Grace Brothers may have seemed like the only solution for a film version, but it might have been better to have a series of vignettes that take us through a typical day at Grace Brothers.This is a must see film for the ""AYBS?"" fan, but it may also be a bit disappointing.

It might have had a chance if the writers had come up with some new material.  Unfortunately, the film is replete with jokes and other bits that were recycled from the TV show and just fell flat in the movie.  As a fan of Are You Being Served, I'm glad that I was able to see the movie, but unfortunately, it just doesn't measure up when compared to the television show.Now about the DVD itself.  Despite the fact that the label lists the film as 16x9 widescreen format, the film is not presented in true widescreen format.  If anything, I would call it a pseudo-widescreen format.  What the manufacturer did was take a standard definition copy of the film and convert it to widescreen format by zooming in on the image effectively cutting off the top and bottom parts of the frame.  Many people don't mind that, but I guess I'm more of a videophile than most because I can't stand to watch video that is not presented in the correct aspect ratio.  I ended up giving up on the DVD after about 15-20 minutes and purchased a VHS copy of the film so that I could enjoy it in full standard definition format without losing half the picture.There may or may not be a true 16x9 version of this film available somewhere, but this is definitely not it.",2,Disappointing in both content and format,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,1446,"['usually', 'case', 'when', 'one', 'transfer', 'successful', 'television', 'shows', 'movies', 'formula', 'fell', 'apart', 'magic', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'did', 'not', 'translate', 'big', 'screen', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'chance', 'writers', 'had', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'material', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'replete', 'jokes', 'other', 'bits', 'were', 'recycled', 'TV', 'show', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'movie', 'fan', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', ""'m"", 'glad', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'just', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'when', 'compared', 'television', 'show.Now', 'DVD', 'fact', 'label', 'film', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'format', 'film', 'not', 'presented', 'true', 'widescreen', 'format', 'anything', 'would', 'call', 'pseudo-widescreen', 'format', 'What', 'manufacturer', 'did', 'was', 'take', 'standard', 'definition', 'copy', 'film', 'convert', 'widescreen', 'format', 'zooming', 'image', 'effectively', 'cutting', 'off', 'top', 'bottom', 'parts', 'frame', 'Many', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'guess', ""'m"", 'more', 'videophile', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'watch', 'video', 'not', 'presented', 'correct', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'ended', 'up', 'giving', 'up', 'DVD', '15-20', 'minutes', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'copy', 'film', 'could', 'enjoy', 'full', 'standard', 'definition', 'format', 'losing', 'picture.There', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'true', '16x9', 'version', 'film', 'available', 'somewhere', 'definitely', 'not']",Are You Being Served?

436124,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6304812817,Robert Badgley,"[0, 0]","""Are you being Served-The Movie""(released 1977),should be more like ""Are you being Served-On Holidays"",for that is what this film adaption of the very popular BBC TV show is all about.All your favourite actors/characters are here:Mollie Sugden as Mrs.Slocombe,Frank Thornton as Captain Peacock,Nicholas Smith as Mr.Rumbold,Arthur Brough as Mr.Grainger,Trevor Bannister as Mr.Lucas,Wendy Richard as Ms.Brahms,Arthur English as Mr.Harman,Harold Bennett as young Mr.Grace and everyone's fave of the show John Inman as Mr.Humphries.It is a delight to revisit this movie once more but unfortunately,or fortunately depending on your perspective,it hasn't gotten better with age,nor worse.It takes a good half hour or more for the movie to start getting the same spark in it that made the TV show such a huge success,and by the time it does the film is about over.The actors' lines are more drawn out as are their facial expressions and demeanour.The producers seemed to think the slower pace would be a nice change of pace for the fans(as the TV show only had 30 minutes in which to do its business) but it just ends up slowing the proceedings and taking away the punch of most of the humour that we are used to.The story begins at the Grace Brothers department store as we are intro'd to the cast there.The writers decided to throw in part of a routine already used from the TV show as a rich Sheik comes in wanting to buy some trousers.Mr.Humphries and Mr.Lucas are called upon to do the ""dirty"" work but it lacks the same punch as the show.As the plot moves forward it seems the staff are going on a free trip to the Spanish town of Costa Plonka,due to much needed renovations at the store.They arrive and the manager is none other than Andrew Sachs fresh from his Fawlty Towers role as Manuel;here he plays one Don Bernardo.The reservations are of course wonky and the group have to sleep in tents until their proper rooms become available the next day. Here the writers also use another gag from the TV show with a note intended for one person getting passed to the wrong one.It starts with Mr Lucas' amorous writing to Ms.Brahms and it escalates from there.Eventually a number of the cast are playing musical tents.Meanwhile the managers brother is a rebel and he intends to launch his ""war"" that very evening from the resort.When he does the battle is short as he is outgunned by the Government forces.The cast is diving for cover all over and who should pull up in a tank but young Mr Grace who is using the safest mode of transport at his disposal

with the loo where one has to sing to let folks know you're using it because there are no door handles.Mr.Humphries as always comes through with his usual aplomb in the dressing department.And it is in this film that if you didn't know which side of the ""fence"" Mr Humphries was on before,you will know now.Mr.Grainger,Mr.Rumbold and Mr.Harmon are used most infrequently and then only as counterpoints.Mr.Harman's usual adolescent sarcasm on TV comes off more haughty and with a distinct bite here.Technically the movie is in its original widescreen ratio and has been transferred pretty

It's very much on par with most of the TV episodes, although it is a shame that so many of the jokes are recycled.  Pacing is a huge problem for the movie, whereas it never was for the TV show.  Maybe the director had never worked in a ""sitcom"" format?  A fast-and-furious AYBS script, when slowed down to the pace and timing of the typical freature film, loses a lot of its charm.  We're given far to much time to think about the holes in the plot.The single biggest problem, however, is the lack of a live audience for the antics.  When watching the show, hearing the audience's reactions, and watching the actors respond to them live, is a big part of what keeps the show fresh and funny.  The lack of a live audience keeps the movie stale and decidedly un-funny.  It's too bad, because I think most of the new jokes written for the film would have worked brilliantly on the small screen.  Here, they are wasted.P.S.  In response to another review:  I really don't think Mr. Humphries is any more openly gay in this script than in the TV episodes.  While some of the jokes may have been more risque than would have been allowable on British television of the era, none of them clearly imply that he's anything more than a sissy and a mother's boy.

However, the movie was lacking.As I first started watching this movie, while they were still in the shop, I noticed that something was lacking, that something about it felt empty.  It was the lack of a laugh track.  Now, in all honesty, most of the time I prefer there not be a laugh track, but in Are You Being Served, a laugh track is essential.  Without the laugh track, the comedic timing of the show was thrown off from the start.Then, as they get into the movie, the jokes aren't new, and the conflict is predictable and leaves you yearning for it to be over.If you are a huge fan of AYBS and want to have the complete collection, that is the only reason I would suggest buying this.  It is the only reason I bought it, and the only value I see in it.  There is definitely little (if any) entertainment value.",2,Only watch it if you are a fan of the show.,1173657600,"03 12, 2007",2007,956,"['TV', 'show', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'be', 'one', 'time', 'favorites', 'believe', 'truly', 'funniest', 'British', 'comedy', 'ever', 'TV', 'However', 'movie', 'was', 'lacking.As', 'first', 'started', 'watching', 'movie', 'were', 'still', 'shop', 'noticed', 'something', 'was', 'lacking', 'something', 'felt', 'empty', 'was', 'lack', 'laugh', 'track', 'Now', 'honesty', 'most', 'time', 'prefer', 'not', 'be', 'laugh', 'track', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'laugh', 'track', 'essential', 'laugh', 'track', 'comedic', 'timing', 'show', 'was', 'thrown', 'off', 'start.Then', 'get', 'movie', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'conflict', 'predictable', 'yearning', 'be', 'over.If', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'AYBS', 'want', 'have', 'complete', 'collection', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'suggest', 'buying', 'only', 'reason', 'bought', 'only', 'value', 'see', 'definitely', 'little', 'entertainment', 'value']",Are You Being Served?

The movie has no ""laugh track"" as does the original series, but it does not bother me.  It is kind of strange not to hear the audience laughing at all the comedy, but for a BIG AYBS? fan, I thought the movie was quite well done, with lots of innuendo and situations that reflect the original series.  May become a collector's item, so I would be sure to purchase while you can!",5,Very Funny Movie (though no laugh track)!!,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",2006,463,"['funny', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'original', 'cast', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'movie', 'laugh', 'track', 'original', 'series', 'not', 'bother', 'kind', 'strange', 'not', 'hear', 'audience', 'laughing', 'comedy', 'BIG', 'AYBS', 'fan', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'lots', 'innuendo', 'situations', 'reflect', 'original', 'series', 'May', 'become', 'collector', 'item', 'would', 'be', 'sure', 'purchase', 'can']",Are You Being Served?
