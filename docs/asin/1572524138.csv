187372,A1VWWTCCFU8EVQ,1572524138,A Customer,"[2, 2]","This delivers an unpleasant family in crisis experience that has a great atmosphere. The script is intelligent and all performances are absolute quality. They made a remake starring Tim Roth which is almost frame by frame the same. Stick with this version because it's original and all round just a better film.You will be very careful when opening your front door to strangers after watching this film. I'm not saying it's a `home security advice' film, but it does give you one of the worst case home invasion scenarios. I love the opening title sequence; it combines a pleasant family drive in the country with classical music playing from the radio and then suddenly, without warning, the most aggressive thrash metal kicks in on the radio which is so out of place from what's on the screen. Simple, different and effective, just the way I like it.You have seen all the villains from Hannibal Lecter to Mick Taylor (Wolf Creek). However, this film excels when disturbed characters are played very differently than anything seen before. Pure evil with no feeling comes to mind. There are two great `out of film' moments that I won't talk about. I loved them both.I find it so frustrating seeing parents being weak and reasonable in a story like this, but it's necessary because if they were portrayed as strong minded people, the film would last no more than 30 minutes max. This is a dialogue heavy film that takes it's time and is absolutely riveting to watch. I have never seen a film like this and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it is. The cruelty is as it needs to be, it could have been a great deal worse. It does not go down the rape route of `A Clockwork Orange' or the horrific scene in the original `Death Wish', however it still manages to give you the feeling of shock and dread.What is does achieve so well is it gives you the thought that whatever your financial situation, or how big your house is, or how articulate and kind you are, home invasion can happen to anyone...even you. This is a very cruel and disturbing film. It's an ordeal to get through and watching the long scenes that take their time and are paced in such a correct and creative way, draws you into the mayhem even more. The early scene in the kitchen is cinematic genius, I'm sure the camera doesn't move for the entire scene. 'Funny Games' is a tremendous unsettling experience.Definitely worth 108 minutes of your life.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com",4,bleedingfilms.com review of 'FUNNY GAMES' (1997),1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,2450,"['unpleasant', 'family', 'crisis', 'experience', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'script', 'intelligent', 'performances', 'are', 'absolute', 'quality', 'made', 'remake', 'starring', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'almost', 'frame', 'frame', 'same', 'Stick', 'version', 'original', 'round', 'just', 'better', 'film.You', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'careful', 'when', 'opening', 'front', 'door', 'strangers', 'watching', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'home', 'security', 'advice', 'film', 'give', 'one', 'worst', 'case', 'home', 'invasion', 'scenarios', 'love', 'opening', 'title', 'sequence', 'pleasant', 'family', 'drive', 'country', 'classical', 'music', 'playing', 'radio', 'then', 'suddenly', 'warning', 'most', 'aggressive', 'thrash', 'metal', 'kicks', 'radio', 'so', 'place', 'what', 'screen', 'Simple', 'different', 'effective', 'just', 'way', 'like', 'it.You', 'have', 'seen', 'villains', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Mick', 'Taylor', 'Wolf', 'Creek', 'However', 'film', 'excels', 'when', 'disturbed', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'very', 'differently', 'anything', 'seen', 'Pure', 'feeling', 'mind', 'are', 'two', 'great', 'film', 'moments', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'loved', 'both.I', 'find', 'so', 'frustrating', 'seeing', 'parents', 'being', 'weak', 'reasonable', 'story', 'necessary', 'were', 'portrayed', 'strong', 'minded', 'people', 'film', 'would', 'last', 'no', 'more', '30', 'minutes', 'max', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'film', 'time', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'watch', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'cruelty', 'be', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'deal', 'worse', 'not', 'go', 'down', 'rape', 'route', 'Clockwork', 'Orange', 'horrific', 'scene', 'original', 'Death', 'Wish', 'however', 'still', 'give', 'feeling', 'shock', 'dread.What', 'achieve', 'so', 'well', 'thought', 'financial', 'situation', 'how', 'big', 'house', 'how', 'articulate', 'kind', 'are', 'home', 'invasion', 'can', 'happen', 'anyone', 'even', 'very', 'cruel', 'disturbing', 'film', 'ordeal', 'get', 'watching', 'long', 'scenes', 'take', 'time', 'are', 'paced', 'such', 'correct', 'creative', 'way', 'draws', 'mayhem', 'even', 'more', 'early', 'scene', 'kitchen', 'cinematic', 'genius', ""'m"", 'sure', 'camera', ""n't"", 'move', 'entire', 'scene', 'Games', 'tremendous', 'unsettling', 'experience.Definitely', 'worth', '108', 'minutes', 'life.bleedingcriticbleedingfilms.com']",N/A
187373,A20HNT8HYIYY0X,1572524138,"Adrian Stranik ""Ade""","[3, 4]","Next time you find yourself looking to define the word `excruciating' look no further than the 1997 Michael Henke chiller Funny Games.The story is a simple tale of two `happy go lucky' young psychopaths who ingratiate themselves with a married couple and their son at a secluded vacation retreat and then go on to hold them hostage and terrorise them by playing - you guessed it - funny games. For the viewer the film is a cinematic endurance test of the darkest timbre, most of the violence takes place off-camera engaging your imagination in the process, which as you know is worse that anything a filmmaker can throw at you. Who knows better than yourself the thing that scares you the most?Just as disturbing, is the ordinariness of the two intruders. Whereas Hannibal Lector or Clockwork Orange's Alex are intelligent, charismatic and (all killing aside) fun, these `funny gamesters' are perfect examples of the brutality of the banal. Their games appear to come from a desire to avoid boredom or worse, from staring into the void where they're likely to come face to face with themselves. If it wasn't for the injurious consequences of their antics they would just as soon bore you to death instead.For all the tricks and frustrations this film subjects you to, none of its horrors even comes close to the sheer mental disturbance of the ultra-white, ultra tight tennis shorts as worn by one of the tormentors. In terms of `all time horrific movie moments', I'd put them right up there with the Exorcist's alternative use of the crucifix or Psycho's shower time etiquette. Be warned, these shorts are only to be viewed by those with a gut like a blacksmith's tool bag.This is probably the only film that has ever been made that is literally asking the viewer ""Why are you watching this?"" Henke's movies generally deal with the extremes of human behaviour but Funny Games employs a series of knowing references to the fact that by witnessing this horror you are somehow complicit in it. The entire film seems to be challenging your continued involvement via explicit devices such as the characters talking about their actions in terms of film structure, and a `rewind' sequence that will have you calling the Samaritans. Even in the final frame you are subconsciously accused of sharing the psyche of the tormentors by still watching; by which time it's too late and the funny game that has been played here is on... you.",4,Funny?

This reviewer strongly recommends seeing the interview prior to watching the film itself.  Charges of hypocrisy will likely be enough for many to drop it before seeing everything -which is a good thing, but this review will attempt to establish the film's worth beyond what at first appears to be self-conscious, smug and pedantic exploitation of the viewer with violence for its own sake. ]Phrases from other reviews like ""so well done it's almost boring"", and ""well done, but still disgusting"" are very true.  This film is more food for thought than violent, cringing thriller drama- that's because it's mostly over before it's even begun, and that's the point of it.General Overview. (No spoilers)The director places the audience into the same relation to *himself* as Paul and Peter do with the family to themselves.  The film is a game in which, if you do not catch on to the rules quick enough, you are exploited.  Playing along, maintaining the veneer of convention as a film goer and viewer is nigh impossible without willingly abstaining from adopting some critical stance to the film itself:  choices are demanded, definite judgement on what the film is and does is required.  There are problematic elements in the film's presentation itself:  the antagonists (one of them at any rate) speaks directly to the camera, turning the audience into accomplices where they had only been voyeurs.  -It's a deadly serious parody of the genre and industry, with little humor about it.  The tremendous spiritual impotence -the pure intellectualism of the game made of violent stimulation of the subject through the abstraction of violence, the reduction of its tragic occurrence and presence in life and the world to abstracted images, *news*,  is put on trial here.  The mania and the impotence embodied by Peter and Paul's  fulfilling the appetite for extreme stimulation via violence within the tediously formal and intellectual parameters of a mere 'game' is, perhaps, only surpassed in trivialization and moral turpitude by a public which readily adopts an equivalent position of these two maniacs -but as voyeurs, as masochists and consumers of titillating trash, -perhaps as mere contrast to boredom, and in escape of it.Analysis, Review.  (*Spoiler Alert* Some Plot Specifics Disclosed)Peter and Paul adhere rigorously to formal conventions of social discourse- so what director Michael Haneke states about the incredible danger presented by someone not receptive to their usage while employing them against you is doubly terrorizing to the family who is having their rights subjugated to the homicidal game initiated by the sociopathic (and nearly comical, at times cartoonish) duo in the film.P&P; create room for maneuver by posing themselves as harmless near idiots and brats to the effect of being treated with indulgent disregard, allowing for their weakness (which is actually a foil for their obsessive desire for power over them) --had Anna and Georg not been bamboozled by this and treated them for what they were *as they appeared*, the game would have ended right there.  Failing to assert their rights, P&P; establish momentum against them that they find as irresistible in direct proportion to the Family's impotence in the face of their apparent childishness and merely bumbling insouciance on the part of Peter,  and of slick but harmless wit and articulation on the part of the waifish Paul.  The result is the torture and death of the Family and the releasing of the evil two for another round of deathly child's play across the lake --for friends of the family who visited early on in this funny game's development in the film.  (This, bearing in mind the awkwardness of their neighbors in the beginning and the emptiness of the house when young Georg seeks refuge next door, gives us reason to believe that P&P; were finishing up yet another game before they began the one focused on in the film.)The appropriate reaction to the suspicious, presumptuous and irritating pretension masqueraded by P&P; as polite, but nascent immaturity is not forthcoming from the WIfe Anna or the Husband Georg.  The intension of reconnaissance in Peter's actions when he appears to ask for eggs are thinly veiled, and simple social awkwardness is insufficient to account for his pressing his egg-request again and again -to the irritation of the Wife; Peter's slavish and clumsy manners are indicative of a liar as much as that of an oaf, and she fails to take appropriate measures to ensure her privacy.  His second appearance (for the last of the four eggs he took obsequious pains to observe in the kitchen, specifically the fact of the ""dozen"" in the cart of which only 8 he had wasted) is occasioned by the ridiculous excuse that the dog had spooked them out of his hands. and is joined by Peter (earlier introduced by the neighbor as a son of a work colleague) who 'cheekily' requests to test a driver in her Husband's golf bag which he admires with articulate envy.  In each case, Anna fails both to fully catch on to their suspect behavior and to engage them on their own terms, forcefully utilizing the antithesis of their slavish politeness and placing them formally in the wrong which they do in fact acknowledge.In Summary:The 'self-reflexivity' incorporated by the writer/director is essential, if irritating and hackneyed in-itself as a device, and alters this film from what would be yet another genre piece into something more substantial -and terrorizing.  Without it, it is merely another film within that genre, well acted.  With it, it is a bad film made worse, and probably necessary to bring about the consciousness of the real evil, real mediocrity of that type of media on the whole.  It is also that much more terrorizing, since the exploitation of the viewer is taken de re, as a beginning, and manipulated into a conscious farce which makes the viewer an accomplice to itself; and it is also, by that very fact enraging -since this film is in-itself an extreme burlesque.For one who gets caught in this act by the film, the events become that much more sickening and cause for rage.  Others who find the violence distasteful will say ""what for?"" and walk away from it  --this film lacks the kind of humor that could make this a mere parody, instead of grotesque burlesque indulging in the worst aspects of an already perverse genre and social trend.  The problematic codependent situation the film anticipates for the viewer watching this, as one complicit  to the violence for its own sake in which you are *invited* to come along forces the adoption of a definite judgement on and stance towards the film:A ""No"" that judges the film as an independent creative object with a didactic function, made to entrap the uncritical viewer but afford insight to anyone willing to approach it from without, en par with its creator,  not participating in its solipsistic trance of violence. Or a ""No"" which judges it as necessarily the most extreme embodiment of what it damns -perhaps its ultimate possible achievement- participating in it regardless, thus worthy of greater contempt for indulging in an evil whilst moralizing against it.The director conveys that this is ideally an un-watchable film, that one walks out of (and on) after Paul's wink at the camera, or at the rewinding scene and any self-reflexive motion to the viewer prior and up to it.  In actuality, it is an un-viewable documentation of violence save the inclusion of these clear signs and narrative devices that indicate in each instance ""this is just a film"",  fictionalizing it.  Everything else belonging to the genre that does not do this is little more than a fictitious documentary of violent events that almost never involve the moral dilemmas in the elements of their plot to justify their existence beyond just revenge, or turning a profit.  The former ""No"" is predicated upon the latter, anger at having been fooled is insufficient to appreciate the film; --and since we in the West generally do not live in culture, cultures that do not produce trash of the kind this film represents to us in an intelligent, pointed way, we cannot afford to toss this out with the rest of it quite yet.  That films of this nature are made at all is encouraging, and perhaps gives hope for conditions free of this influence in the future.____  ____  ____Director: Michae HanekeAnna.

I purchased this DVD after reading Fangorias book on ''100 Horror Films Youve never seen''- I dont know if I could classify this as strictly horror, it goes beyond that.This is a whole other realm thats never been touched... At least not to this severity.. Ive seen many horror/psychological terror films and after watching the likes of Maniac or Gummo I didnt think anything could outdo it, but this beats them all. Gummo was disturbing but it had no merit to it; this film has more to it than the sadistic violence and ''funny games'' the characters play. Ive never seen anything like this. The director takes a more original approach, during the film the killers actually look and talk to the camera at times, not often; but they even play the ''games'' with the audience.Plot- a couple, their child and dog go to their vacation home. Soon after that the couple is visited by a pair of clean cut young men who soon turn ruthless and brutal. When they first introduce themselves they look like normal polite people, but when one comes over to the house asking to ''borrow eggs'' you know something is coming., You just dont know when and you are anticipating when this guy is going to lose it. You keep rooting for the victims as the film drags on, hoping that somehow they will make it..at least one of them. It goes on and on, the games dont stop, not even at the end.This film is cruel, brutal, cold, radical, provocative with unbelievable psychological games and horror. A real eye-opener. Its not a family movie of course, it's something you would want to watch alone or in the company of someone very open-minded. You will probably be angry, depressed and astonished at the same time...as you witness the events that unfold in front of your eyes.Recomended if you think you can handle this...

Unfortunately, this is exactly what happens to the unsuspecting vacationing couple of Funny Games.  Two neatly dressed normal-looking young men intrude into the family home and subjugate the family by killing the dog and disabling the father, leaving wife and a kid await in horror for what happens next.From this point on the whole movie becomes a torment for the audience rather than home entertainment.  We become viewers of extreme cruelty and sadism frivolously delivered by the two gloating maniacs.  As the film progresses it becomes a challenging exercise in patience and emotional endurance.  The movie is not actually scary per see but overly frustrating.  Half into a movie I loathed the intruders so much that the scene where one of them gets hurt gave me more satisfaction then any violent act against a villain in any movie I can remember.  The message of violence is highlighted strongly by Henke's treatment of the material.Overall, I never thought that I could see a more disturbing film than Event Horizon.  But Funny Games showed me not just that Even Horizon could be outdone but that the greatest horrors do not reside with mysteriously evil aliens, ghosts or monsters but could simply be found in our seemingly friendly neighbors.",4,My worst nightmare has been put on film!,1059177600,"07 26, 2003",2003,1402,"['What', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'two', 'sadists', 'invading', 'home', 'not', 'rob', 'simply', 'subject', 'family', 'extreme', 'humiliation', 'torture', 'Unfortunately', 'exactly', 'what', 'unsuspecting', 'vacationing', 'couple', 'Funny', 'Games', 'Two', 'neatly', 'dressed', 'normal-looking', 'young', 'men', 'intrude', 'family', 'home', 'subjugate', 'family', 'killing', 'dog', 'disabling', 'father', 'leaving', 'wife', 'kid', 'await', 'horror', 'what', 'next.From', 'point', 'whole', 'movie', 'torment', 'audience', 'rather', 'home', 'entertainment', 'become', 'viewers', 'extreme', 'cruelty', 'sadism', 'frivolously', 'delivered', 'two', 'gloating', 'maniacs', 'film', 'challenging', 'exercise', 'patience', 'emotional', 'endurance', 'movie', 'not', 'actually', 'scary', 'see', 'overly', 'frustrating', 'Half', 'movie', 'loathed', 'intruders', 'so', 'much', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'hurt', 'gave', 'more', 'satisfaction', 'then', 'violent', 'act', 'villain', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'message', 'violence', 'highlighted', 'strongly', 'Henke', 'treatment', 'material.Overall', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'see', 'more', 'disturbing', 'film', 'Event', 'Horizon', 'Funny', 'Games', 'showed', 'not', 'just', 'Even', 'Horizon', 'could', 'be', 'outdone', 'greatest', 'horrors', 'do', 'not', 'reside', 'mysteriously', 'evil', 'aliens', 'ghosts', 'monsters', 'could', 'simply', 'be', 'found', 'seemingly', 'friendly', 'neighbors']",N/A
187378,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,1572524138,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 8]","My initial interest in watching this `97 horror film was the impressive trailers for the Naomi Watts vehicle that came out the beginning of the year.  The orchestral music in the background; the rich clean whites; Watt's signature breakdown and Michael Pitt looking more intriguing than I've ever seen him; all of which caused me to really ache to see the film.  Before I could do that though I needed to see the original, which isn't all that old in fact.  Directed by Michael Haneke (who happens to also direct the `08 remake) with bravado and precision, `Funny Games' is probably the most effective film of its kind I have seen in a very long time.  Knowing full well that less is more, Haneke is able to bring the fear and dread home to the audience without ever really (I say `really' because it's not absolute) showing a brutal murder onscreen.  Yes, most of the violence takes place within earshot of the audience but the aftereffects of the sadism is seen and felt full force.The film opens with a family of three making their way to their summer home for vacation.  Georg, Anna and their young son Schorshi are ready for some fun on the lake, boating and swimming and spending time with friends.  Shortly after getting there though, their idea of fun and games takes a drastic change.  While Anna is preparing dinner Peter shows up at her door claiming to be visiting their friends next door and wondering if he could borrow some eggs.  The request seems innocent but it soon becomes apparent that Peter's intentions are anything but.  Then Peter's friend Paul shows up, and despite Anna's efforts to get them to leave they refuse.  The Georg and Schorschi come in from outside and suddenly the family finds themselves captives in their own home, playing a sick and twisted game for their own lives with two complete strangers that look harmless yet prove themselves to be more dangerous than anyone could have imagined.There are plenty of horror films that follow a similar formula to that of `Funny Games', the difference though lies in the direction, which is above and beyond flawless here.  Michael Haneke (who also scripted this film) is pure genius; creating a prose that is so deep-rooted in the audience they can't seem to shake it from their skin.  It was funny because I was telling my wife, shortly after the film ended, that while I've seen gorier more violent films I have yet to truly see a more emotionally disturbing one.  Where `Funny Games' succeeds is making the situation and the people involved real to the audience, a part of us.  We feel their fear and pain and hopelessness.  There is one scene in particular; right after the first shot is fired with devastating effects, where we get to see raw human emotion at its most impressive.  As the single shot (ten minutes or so in length) simply captures the emotional responses of Anna and Georg as they sit in silence or moan in agony merely trying to take in all that is happening to them, the viewer is brought to their level of pain and misery and we personally have our inners gutted from us and are left with that hollow feeling of solitude.The actors involved do a miraculous job of breathing a sense of reality into this film.  Susanne Lothar and Ulrich Muhe are utter perfection as the distressed couple and Arno Frisch and Frank Giering are quite effective as their tormentors.  Young Stefan Clapczynski does a capable job as Schorschi and actually handles himself extremely well in some of the films most heart racing scenes (the scene where he attempts escape had me holding my breath in pure manifested fear).  Without dedicated performances by the entire cast this film could have fallen short or come up a tad cheesy, but it never falters from raw human fear and delivers strongly throughout its entirety.I still have yet to see the remake (which is on video soon so I will be seeing it shortly) but I have great expectations for it.  I adore Naomi Watts and Tim Roth and with Haneke resting firmly in the director's seat once again I have a very good feeling about the American version of this film.It's a beautiful thing (I use the word `beautiful' very loosely) when a scary movie actually sends a chill down your spine.  `Funny Games' sends a shockwave.  I was on edge throughout the entire film, my nerves shot, my skin crawling, my chest constricting, my breath fighting for escape.  I am not one who is easily spooked, but this film haunted me for days.  I highly recommend this film to anyone detested with the current state of `horror' these days and looking for an honest and rewarding thrill.  This is not a film that will make you feel good.  It will repulse and depress you and may even make you feel dirty (Haneke goes to great lengths to make the audience feel party to the sadistic madness taking place on the screen) but in the end `Funny Games' surpasses all taboo's and simply delivers the goods.",5,"Far from funny;

I couldn't sleep after seeing it, but after about a week had passed, I was very glad that I'd seen it.  I'm now ""immune"" from being manipulated into enjoying onscreen violence, because the movie made me keenly aware of when I AM being manipulated ... and of the ""commandments"" that movies featuring cathartically satisfying acts of vengeance are built upon and dare not violate.The storyline is sort of a hybrid of THE DESPERATE HOURS and CAPE FEAR, with two very Aryan-looking young men invading the summer cottage of an upper-middle-class family of three and sadistically playing ""funny games"" with them.  But there's much more than the surface story at work here ... Haneke has some clever tricks up his sleeve when it comes to exercising his total control over the ""rules"" that the movie plays by.  He keeps the audience off-balance by repeatedly violating movie conventions and confounding conditioned expectations as to how events will unfold.Amazingly, there's only ONE act of on-screen violence in the entire movie ... and it's a classic example of the 100% acceptable,  ""justifiable"" sort that American audiences so crave and Hollywood so obligingly provides on a regular basis.  But just as your ""rush"" kicks in, Haneke pulls the carpet out from underneath you with one of his sleight-of-hand tricks, flip-flopping your pleasure into an equivalent amount of pain.  And as for the RESULTS of the OFF-screen violence ... well, you're on your own.Special kudos should go out to actors Arno Frisch and Frank Giering, for being willing to play what must be the creepiest, most contemptible crime duo in movie history.

It takes fearlessness to make yourself a target for audience detestation at this level, and the film wouldn't work if the roles hadn't been so capably filled.Know going in that the ""See it if you dare"" challenge on the DVD cover is not to be taken lightly.

187385,A22K5CUTUGJMAA,1572524138,Brian,"[5, 6]","The reviews, not the subject matter, of 'Funny Games' made me curious enough to give it a watch;  that is to say, despite the fact that the genre that spawned it has been overcrowded for decades now, few contemporary horror/suspense flicks have spurred the kind of high-spirited, heady debate that seems to follow FG around.  So without wallowing indulgently in my own Weltanschauung, as FG does in its for excruciating chunks of time, let me get right to it and say that I find the film wildly overrated and, more particularly, overanalyzed.  Regardless of what its creators think it is, FG is really nothing more than a modernized (read pretentious, ironic or 'deconstructed' as you like) remake of Craven's 'Last House on the Left,' which is a blunted, bloody and largely silly remake of Wyler's 'Desperate Hours'-- a well-constructed story that intelligently explores the emotional havoc attendant to a brutal home-invasion scenario and stands today as the cinematic standard-bearer of that played-out theme (1954's 'Suddenly,' 1967's 'In Cold Blood' and 1971's 'Straw Dogs' are some comparatively effective examples).  FG's many plot and pacing deficiencies are mitigated alternately by the gimmickry of the eponymous 'game,' which is lazily scripted, as well as, more interestingly, director Haneke's breaking of the 'fourth wall,' which unfortunately is executed too inconsistently and casually to have any serious impact on the viewer's sense of voyeurism, decency, shame, or whatever was intended.  The ultra-violence (mostly implied) and humiliation perpetrated by the suitably quirky killers Peter and Paul (ugh) on their victims must then serve as the centerpiece of this hash, but those elements are so commonplace, so expected in this context, that their shock value (or their contribution to any larger moral conversation) fades into the appropriately blank interiors.

This is not a violent horror film, If you are looking for a good gore-feast this isn't it. This film relys heavily on psychological probing.The directors tool in this film is to access emotions and or the sub concious of the viewer. The director is trying to use tactics to make you forget for a moment that you are watching a film, And get you to think what you are watching is real and can easily happen to you. In some ways he succeeds. In this film we see a family staying in a nice lake shore home, But little do they know. There are a couple of upper class young men that have in some ways been corrupted by their lifestyle. They have gotten used to the feeling so much that they become restless. They must seek new ways to release anger they feel towards their social lives or even hatred towards their parents or just society.The boys use unfamiliar and innocent ways to gain trust of the wife in the film. He simply asks for eggs, And keeps dropping them or using other ways to keep entry for as long as possible. And when his pal (The Brians) comes into the picture things start changing. They become violent and begin taking pleasure in what they are doing. The director attempts to startle you by having the actors look or talk to the camera, Again this is one of the film's strongpoints. You don't see this in every day cinema.It actually in some way catches you off guard.Another effective thing the director does is get the viewer to let their guard down. Make you comfortable for a moment and then suddenly shatter it with another mind playing scene. The only thing that makes the characters effective is that you see that the culprits enjoy what they are doing. They make sure that there is some false hope. One moment there is a chance of surviving the situation and then it disapears. You soon realize that nobody is getting out. Which makes the film a very unique experience.The director is genius in his own way.This film is definteley recommended. It is not over the top or too weak.

I expected to be either horrified or mesmerized, or perhaps both.What I didn't expect was boredom. But that's what I got.Imagine ""The Desperate Hours"" starring Laurel and Hardy as the criminals. Add a lot of sadism and take out all the suspense, since it's pretty clear from the start how everything will turn out. And that's about it. Highly unpleasant, but a snore.Oh wait, I forgot. ""Haneke brilliantly lets the criminals make meta-comments to the audience. With sly winks and remarks about 'putting on a good show,' they implicate the film's viewers in the violence taking place on screen, radically shifting the traditional perspective and forcing the audience into an admission of its own voyeurism. Astute viewers are compelled to realize that they, too, have become involved in the grisly proceedings: they *choose* to watch, even though they could use their remote controls to do otherwise, just as one of the killers uses this device to reconstruct his reality in a nonlinear fashion, destabilizing the hegemony of conventional chronology in this masterpiece of blah blah blah.""Double snore. Meta-commentary has been around forever. Check out some of Buster Keaton's films from the 1920s, in which characters comment on how much the stunt men are being paid for their pratfalls. ""Sherlock Jr."" (1924) shatters more boundaries between film and audience than a boatload of Hanekes.On the positive side, the direction, acting, and cinematography in ""Funny Games"" are quite good, but only as far as the script allows.

187397,A1LF84ED2L4MXB,1572524138,Doreen Appleton,"[2, 7]","This grim movie can be seen as a metaphor for the rise of Nazism. The killers are clean-cut young men (significantly, in the American version, their hair is cut in a Hitler Youth style) who get inside the family's house apparently innocently. Once they are inside (like the Nazi youth Hitler mobilized in the early 30s) you can't get rid of them.We see the one boy calmly making a sandwich in the kitchen while sounds of torture are heard in the next room. This is a very typical depiction of the German insensitivity to atrocity while enjoying everyday pleasures.Significantly, when the wife prepares to run for help, the husband says ""Forgive me."" That is what countless husbands said at the railroad station after assuring their families that the Nazi movement was nothing. ""Forgive me for being wrong.""The white gloves signify the impersonal machinery of the Nazi extermination machine. Millions are dead, but the hands of the perpetrators are clean.In the American version both boys are well-built, with strong legs. In the German version the slight, dark-haired boy is the brains of the operation and his overweight partner is the mindless bully. This is a Nazi clich&eacute;, I think the American casting was better.The most extraordinary shot of the movie is when the wife grabs the shotgun and kills one of the killers. But the other killer grabs the TV remote and rewinds the scene so that the gun is taken away from the wife. This is a distancing device that allows us to see that we're watching is a parody, an artificial presentation of violence.In another display of filmwise irony, the husband tells the wife not to cooperate, they will die more quickly. The killer says, ""No, we're not up to feature film length yet.""The clumsy ultimatums to the wife, ""play the game right and we won't kill your husband,"" this kind of behavior on the part of the Nazis was well known long before Styron published Sophie's Choice, so much so that Styron was criticized for offering as his astonishing discovery what had been known for decades.Finally, the discussion between the killers about ""anti-matter"" and ""parallel universes"" is a clear allusion to the brilliance of the German scientists which colludes with the scientific extermination strategies of the Nazis.I was much more unnerved by the American version than by the German version. There was something foreign, incomprehensible about the torture of Tim Roth and Naomi Watts. This was because this is not an American story. Played by German actors in German, it makes much more sense and is therefore less frightening. We may have murdered a lot of native Americans, but we didn't build crematoria capable of killing 60,000 people in one day. That is a German achievement.For sixty years German writers, filmmakers, poets have tried to come to terms with the Holocaust. This is a recent, brilliant effort at the same fruitless accommodation. It was monstrous, it was inhuman, and the Germans, one of the most civilized peoples in the world, did it. Their fathers did it. Their grandfathers did it.

It begins innocuously enough but gets more sinister by the moment.I won't detail their torture because that would give the game away really. The film seems to be a bit of a nudge-nudge wink-wink joke which plays the viewer on as if to say "" Hey guys, it's really just a film. The way one of the thugs winks at the camera or just talks to the viewer as if to ask for our opinion as to what would we do in that situation. It's clever but yet it also reminds you of Saved By The Bell and Parker Lewis Can't Lose in how they'd talk to the camera as to involve you in the whole scene. However it's done to extremes here. But that's Haneke would have wanted it!The film is not cheery, you will not get a happy ending and it is a sort of endurance test in to how much you can tolerate. In that respect it works like a horror movie. But this is not really a horror movie. It takes on psychological aspects which you don't get with cheap frights which give you a thrill. This is pure terror. OK there is one scene where you might cheer but that is quickly rewound to give further evidence that this is just a film.Another point I'd like to make is the heavy metal song used, it has to be the most unstructured metal song I have ever heard. But on a more serious note, does Haneke imply all these thugs who carry out these horrific crimes in real life, listen to heavy metal music? That's a sort of lazy stereotype to trot out that's been bandied about by the media to create unease. In that sense I'm a little disappointed but really that's only minor when such a movie is made to grip you by the throat and force you into submission.This film has no stylized violence that you would normally get. This is the real deal. It is brutal and it is unfriendly at best. Most of all it sets out what it wants to do - to shock people by the sheer brutality of mankind.

It was the horror that really scared, devastated, and stayed with me long after the final scene was over. I can't easily recall another movie that made me go through the same emotions as the innocent victims in the movie did, to feel the same helplessness, hopelessness, despair, humiliation, and horror. I could not stop thinking of how illusory and fragile nature of happiness and safety is and how easy it is to shatter and destroy them. Is it a blessing or curse not to know what lies ahead and not be able to change the future? It's been several years since I saw the film but it still makes me shiver just to think about it.""Funny Games"" can be first mistaken for yet another conventional thriller where the good guys always win in the end and the evil is punished. Wrong, not by Haneke. He shocks you, he hits you in the gut, and then, he shocks you again. Haneke's is a true horror for his monsters don't look like the creatures from hell. No, ""they are among us"", they are nice and polite, well read, shy and ironic, they have the names  from the new Testament, Paul and Peter,  they talk with the soft refined voices but they are monsters nevertheless who have no regard for a human life and who want to play their sadistic funny games to the extreme.""Funny Games"" is a controversial film and I've read many reviews and comments that call it ""a failure"", accusing the film and its creator in not having said anything new or original on the connected subjects of violence, the media, and voyeuristic audience.

187402,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,1572524138,General Zombie,"[4, 6]","Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" is one of the more remarkable and distinctive films I've seen in recent memory.  Not one of the best ones, though it's certainly good, but it's quite unusual in that it's the only self-referential and self-aware film I can think of that isn't just trying to be cute.  Films that acknowledge film conventions traditionally just kinda wink at the camera and maybe tweak the traditions ever so slightly, but they rarely ever really defy the norm.  They just seem to think that, somehow, acknowledging that your film is totally formulaic is some sort of excuse or reason for it being that way, and then the audience decides that their being aware of this makes them really clever and insightful, and so everyone is happy.  ""Funny Games"" isn't like that.  ""Funny Games"" is a thriller, but it could almost more properly said to be an anti-thriller.  Ultimately, I don't think that this method is entirely effective, though they need not be followed as slavishly as they often our, thriller conventions exist for a reason: They work, at least when the filmmakers know what they're doing.  ""Funny Games"" doesn't really work, but that's the whole point, and while I sure don't think we need a lot of films like this one, it's interesting for now, anyway.""Funny Games"" opens in pretty standard fashion: A fairly well to do Austrian family, Georg, Anna and their son Georg Jr. (I believe) are staying at their nice lake house when two strange young men come to the door with a request for a few eggs.  Though polite the young men are a little bit strange, making an nuisance of themselves and spilling and breaking things.  Eventually it becomes quite apparent that they have no intention of leaving, and they subdue the family by, among other things, breaking the fathers leg, and they determine to spend the night playing ""games"" to determine if the family lives or dies.On paper, I'm sure, this sounds fairly normal, and it is initially, though it takes a more subtle approach, with the film being overwhelmingly uncomfortable in the early stages of the low-key conflict between the two parties which refuses to boil over for the longest time, or so it seems then.  Not too long into the film, however, arrives the much famed breaking point: One of the boys, I forget which one, winks at the camera.  From this point on things get more than a little strange as the antagonists address the camera on various occasions, berating the audience, asking them what they think will happen and generally questioning the voyeuristic nature of the whole enterprise.  Truthfully, this is one of the less effective aspects of the film, as it allows for the flat out explication of Haneke's theme:  Film violence is bad!!!!  This doesn't work for me, partially because it's overwhelmingly unsubtle, but moreso because I don't buy it.  I've never seen any real evidence that viewing violence in the media has a substantial effect on anyone who isn't already unstable or stupid.  Needless to say, I weary of being berated about these things, but Haneke expresses his ideas in other, less obvious means and to much greater effect.The most significantly bizarre storytelling method in ""Funny Games"" is that it refuses to allow for the standard buildups and climaxes and general flow you'd find in a thriller.  It has plenty of buildup, but it never explodes as expected, or we are not allowed to see it.  For example, at one point the family decides to aggressively rebel, but instead of showing us the scene Haneke has the camera follow one of the two boys into the kitchen where he makes himself a sandwich while the sound effects from the conflict come from the other room.  This has a certain tension of its own, as we wonder just what's going on in the other room, but the theoretical catharsis of action is still denied the audience.  Then Haneke piles on top of this by giving us an extremely extended look into the aftermath of the scene, which is exceedingly grim and lacking in action.  (For the most part it involves watching certain characters sit around in a nearly catatonic state.)  I don't want to give away too much more, but rest assured that this is how the movie generally functions, downplaying any action and even refusing to show us any violence, but only the aftermath and the pain or the anxious buildup.  Again, this is an intellectual approach to film making that doesn't entirely work dramatically but that is, again, what Haneke was going for.  The whole idea is that the excitement and fun must be taken from the violence, which it is.It may look like ""Funny Games"" is something of a one trick pony, and this is definitely the case.  Frankly, it over stays it's welcome slightly, but it never drags too much  That said, the climax is pretty brilliant and utterly shocking.  I hear that lots of people hate it, and I guess I can understand that position, but it's just great from a thematic perspective and as a culmination of what's come before.  I don't dare describe the stunning event specifically, but you'll damn sure know it when you see it.  It's honestly one of the most surprising things I've ever seen in a movie.Haneke is currently remaking ""Funny Games"" in English, and I'm quite curious to see how it turns out.  Reportedly, Haneke plans to make it more bleak and disturbing, as violence in film has gotten steadily worse over the last decade.  Furthermore, even though it's a small production, the production values are bound to be much higher, and some first-rate actors are cast.  (Specifically, Naomi Watts (WOOOOOOOOOOO!) and Tim Roth (Well, no woooo, for him, but he's a good actor, anyway), so it shows some promise.)  On the other hand, ""Funny Games"" seems like a particularly one of a kind film for a which any remake would be bound to be pointless.  Either way we've got this version, and it's definitely worth a look for anyone who's interested in seeing something more than a little bit different.Grade: B+",4,"Not 100% effective, but it earns a

187404,A1ZS82R4RC0I2N,1572524138,gonn1000,"[1, 1]","And now for something completely different...Director Michael Haneke brings a disturbing, innovative and totally insane movie that will leave the viewer on the flipside. This is one of the most suspenseful, edgy and frightening pictures of the last years, an astounding piece of psychological terror.Two guys enter a family`s house and ask the mother to lend them some eggs. This innofensive attitude will lead to an unpredictable and also sick sequence of events, creating a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere.This is a violent and highly heavy movie, yet what scares the most is what we don`t actually see but only imagine. Haneke knows how to develop disturbing and gruesome scenes without going into cheap and uninteresting gore. He truly creates a new kind of horror in here.As the plot unfolds, the tension rises until it gets a point where it`s almost unwatchable due to the way some moments are filmed. Still, the viewer (or me, at least) stays until the end and actually has to deal with all these horrible scenes in order to discover the final showdown. It`s a worthwile activity, but not an easy or pleasurable one.Haneke shows the violence-obssessed society in which we live in nowadays, delivering a cinematic experience that works amazingly well as a satire and serious food for thought. It wisely shows the creepiness of the peeping toms out there with huge voyeuristic tendencies that can`t stop increasing today. ""Funny Games"" presents the ridiculousness of that situation, challenging the passive and cynical spectator and delivering an interactive and memmorable picture.This cult movie is certainly not an easy watch, as it`s way different from the current blockbusters around. It`s not entertaining and at times it`s almost painful to continue, but it`s also a rewarding, challenging and powerful film, hitting the viewer and leaving a deep scar. Obviously, its rewatch value is limited (unless you are really into very strange, doubtful stuff and can stomach to be amused with this usually), but it`s worth catching once.All in all, it`s a game worth playing, yet you should be careful...",4,MAD TV,1076889600,"02 16, 2004",2004,2111,"['now', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Director', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'disturbing', 'innovative', 'totally', 'insane', 'movie', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'flipside', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'edgy', 'frightening', 'pictures', 'last', 'years', 'astounding', 'piece', 'psychological', 'terror.Two', 'guys', 'enter', 'family', 's', 'house', 'ask', 'mother', 'lend', 'eggs', 'innofensive', 'attitude', 'will', 'lead', 'unpredictable', 'also', 'sick', 'sequence', 'events', 'creating', 'tense', 'claustrophobic', 'atmosphere.This', 'violent', 'highly', 'heavy', 'movie', 'yet', 'what', 'most', 'what', 'don', 't', 'actually', 'see', 'only', 'imagine', 'Haneke', 'how', 'develop', 'disturbing', 'gruesome', 'scenes', 'going', 'cheap', 'uninteresting', 'gore', 'truly', 'new', 'kind', 'horror', 'here.As', 'plot', 'unfolds', 'tension', 'point', 'where', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'due', 'way', 'moments', 'are', 'filmed', 'Still', 'viewer', 'least', 'end', 'actually', 'deal', 'horrible', 'scenes', 'order', 'discover', 'final', 'showdown', 's', 'worthwile', 'activity', 'not', 'easy', 'pleasurable', 'one.Haneke', 'violence-obssessed', 'society', 'live', 'nowadays', 'delivering', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'amazingly', 'well', 'satire', 'serious', 'food', 'thought', 'wisely', 'creepiness', 'peeping', 'out', 'there', 'huge', 'voyeuristic', 'tendencies', 'can', 't', 'stop', 'increasing', 'today', 'Funny', 'Games', 'ridiculousness', 'situation', 'challenging', 'passive', 'cynical', 'spectator', 'delivering', 'interactive', 'memmorable', 'picture.This', 'cult', 'movie', 'certainly', 'not', 'easy', 'watch', 's', 'way', 'different', 'current', 'blockbusters', 's', 'not', 'entertaining', 'times', 'almost', 'painful', 'continue', 's', 'also', 'rewarding', 'challenging', 'powerful', 'film', 'hitting', 'viewer', 'leaving', 'deep', 'scar', 'Obviously', 'rewatch', 'value', 'limited', 'are', 'really', 'very', 'strange', 'doubtful', 'stuff', 'can', 'stomach', 'be', 'amused', 'usually', 's', 'worth', 'catching', 'once.All', 's', 'game', 'worth', 'playing', 'yet', 'should', 'be', 'careful']",N/A

I had read a bit about it well before I ever saw it and knew that it would be strong stuff.  But I came to it as someone who is interested in German language cinema and not as hardcore thriller fan.  For that reason, I think, I found not only the film's brutality but the assumption that viewers are &quot;complicit&quot; in the violence all the more bothersome.Simply stated, I did not feel &quot;complicit&quot;--and felt a little resentful of the notion that I should.  What I did feel was horror and a sense of compassion for some perfectly average, reasonably likeable people who fall victim to vicious young sadists.  I just wanted it to end, in other words, and I wanted some justice for the victims and punishment for the perpetrators.I guess that may be one of the reactions that director Michael Haneke was actually aiming for.  Actually, however, it's almost impossible to state conclusively just what he hoped to achieve with this film.  If he wanted to make a statement that horrible crimes are just that--horrible--and should not be the basis of our entertainment, well, I'd have to agree with him.  But I also tend to agree with numerous reviewers both in Amazon and the IMDb, that Haneke seems to want to have it both ways, coming up with a film that is supposed to be simultaneously an effective thriller and a scathing critique of the genre.The movie may be accurately termed as &quot;devilishly clever&quot;--with all that that phrase implies.  Although the Amazon reviewer above is certainly justified in referring to the two young murderers as being like Leopold and Loeb, that is only an impression.  The two characters remain cyphers throughout--no psychologigizing a la &quot;Rope&quot; or &quot;Swoon&quot;--and one can't help feeling that's deliberate.  We don't even ever really learn their actual names (&quot;Peter and Paul&quot;? &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;?  &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;?).  Of course, we aren't told all that much about the victims either, but as stultifyingly middle class as the family seems, they become almost endearing in their averageness.  There is no way in God's heaven and earth that they can be said to deserve their fate.When he breaks down the fourth wall, as he does in a couple of key scenes, Haneke actually provides the viewer with a sense of relief.  As others have noted, you can actually catch your breath at these moments and remind yourself, &quot;It's only a movie.&quot; After the &quot;remote&quot; scene, the film's power is considerably deflated.

187407,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,1572524138,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[0, 0]","Michael Haneke has a unique talent.  Aside from being a very charismatic individual and a fine filmmaker, his film get inside your head and stay there for weeks.  You find yourself thinking about them at moments you never expect.  The first film I saw of his, The White Ribbon, does this, and this film, one of his most famous/infamous, does as well.Funny Games is an extremely unsettling, fascinating, difficult, and ""in your head"" (NOT in your face) film that is a true provocation.  Many of Haneke's detractors have said that this film is just overrated shock value, but it isn't.  There's something amiss here.  The plot is about a bourgeois couple spending some time in their summer home.  They are accosted by two young males who end up taking them hostage and make them play ""funny games"", leading to horrifying repercussions.  It is to Haneke's credit that he manages to sneak up on you and pulls the carpet from under your whole consciousness SEVERAL times during this film.  It's not just one neat twist at the end.  The whole film is really twisted and is so subtle at times that you don't realise things in it until after you've watched it.  And then it totally floors you.  Haneke also films in very long takes and wide shots, giving a menace to the proceedings that a lesser director wouldn't.  You'll remember this film long after it's over.The performances here are superlative.  The 2 young men who are the tormentors are creepy and terrifying, the boy is superb, and the mother/wife gives probably the best performance in the movie.

He uses old Hitchcock tropes to play the audience like an organ.  Unlike the Master's best efforts, however, there is nothing enjoyable about the manipulation; in the end, the film seems tedious and pointless and a waste of good acting talent.  The message of this film seems to be &quot;you're all scum for watching my movie, so I am going to do everything in my power to disappoint you.&quot;  The only good reason to watch a film like this is to watch the psychopaths get their comeuppance; Haneke knows this very well, and so he uses the pretentious device of carefully robbing the audience of any satisfactory result, while teasing us with the possibility that justice just *might* be done.  Clever, eh?  Maybe, but the fact that he has to go to extreme and improbable lengths to develop some of his set pieces means that his wires are showing.  The self-indulgent result is that in the end, the film is more fun for the director than the audience, and watching it is an exercise in masochism.

But admittedly it is expertly made and completely convincing. So please do not misunderstand my two stars as approval or faint recommendation. Stay away from this thing!Why review it at all? Because somebody thought it is worth a remake. It is coming out new and fresh with a great cast (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth). Not that the original cast was bad, it was on the same high level.Why remake it at all? I wish I knew. I have not often thought of suggesting to ban a film. And it is not even old, under 20 years. What sometimes justifies remakes is development of film technology, as in the case of King Kong, or the planned Birds (both with Watts, oddly). This would not apply here, it is a low budget script. Remake because it is 'foreign'? Would that imply that somebody shoots for larger audiences? Probably. I hope it flops completely.What are these funny games?

187413,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,1572524138,Jeffrey Leach,"[5, 5]","I have seen a lot of bizarre cinema in my time, especially within the last year or so, but very few match &quot;Funny Games.&quot; An Austrian film from director Michael Haneke, &quot;Funny Games&quot; is sure to leave an indelible mark on your memory long after you watch it. Unfortunately, this film lost a bit of its impact because I have the bad habit of reading reviews about films before I see them. &quot;Funny Games&quot; is the sort of experience best assimilated when you know absolutely nothing about it going in. If I ever watch this film again, and I cannot say I will because it is so grim and depressing, I must bring along a poor soul who knows nothing about what he/she will see. While I cannot recapture the experience of watching Haneke's wicked little film for the first time, I can gain some measure of satisfaction by viewing the expressions of horror and disgust flickering across the mug of an uninitiated victim. Man oh man! Just thinking about this movie again gives me shivers.&quot;Funny Games&quot; is about, well, decidedly unfunny games. You get the impression rather quickly that this movie is going to be a tad different: a family of three--mother Anna, father Georg, and their son--cruise down a highway headed for a nice vacation at their lakeside cabin. The three barely settle in when a strange young man appears at the screen door asking Anna if he can borrow some eggs. Seeing no problem with such a mundane request, mom lets the man in and proceeds to assist him. This guy is incredibly clumsy, constantly dropping eggs and asking for more. Then another chap shows up asking about his friend. The two verbally spar with Anna, quickly reducing her to a flustered mess anxious to see the two men leave. When Georg shows up to see what all the commotion is about, the games begin. One of these guys, in the course of the ensuing conversation, smashes Georg's knee in with a golf club. The unsettling feeling churning in the pit of our stomachs now assumes a greater urgency. Something is definitely wrong here, and the rest of the film proceeds to show us, in sickeningly slow and agonizing detail, exactly what that is.These two guys are definitely sociopaths, a condition that becomes markedly clear as they haul the family upstairs, force them to sit on a couch, and proceed to verbally and physically assault them. The &quot;games&quot; include forcing Anna to disrobe in front of her husband and child, asking numerous questions pregnant with ominous meanings, and continually making subtle threats against the family members. As much as the two thugs torment the family, director Haneke plays a few games with his audience as well. At several points throughout the film, one of the thugs turns to face the camera and makes various comments about what is going on or what the two are about to do. If you have even an iota of sympathy for the victims here, and you will, Haneke's techniques instill a deep sense of dread about what is going on. You want to watch onscreen violence for entertainment? Well, &quot;Funny Games&quot; makes sure you participate to the fullest in the horrors unfolding against Georg, Anna, and their son. Moreover, Haneke insists we know our role here. If we want to watch violence, we are at the complete mercy of those onscreen. Want to see the family pull it out in the end and free themselves from these two goons? O.K., there you go...but wait a minute! Haneke refuses to play by the rules! There are rules in these types of movies, right? Wrong. Remember, we wanted to see some excruciating onscreen violence. We get a taste of cathartic revenge before &quot;Funny Games&quot; decides to mix it up a little in order to carry the game all the way to its nasty conclusion. Yes, the movie cheats in many ways to devastating effect.&quot;Funny Games&quot; is just downright disturbing. The violence is definitely not the over the top type of stuff, but what we do get coldly and boldly breaks taboos. In place of the typical &quot;a few slashes and they are dead&quot; violence seen in nearly every horror film, Haneke's horrific scenes carry deep psychological connotations. At one point in the film the thugs suddenly leave after committing a terrible act of violence against Anna and Georg's son. We find ourselves hoping that this signals the end of the nightmare, but such an easy out is not in the cards. Besides, a sudden conclusion wouldn't give us our dose of violence. Actually, repeated attempts to get out of this mess only create more problems for Anna and Georg. It is at this point, after the two goons leave and Anna attempts to seek help, that I saw a few problems with the movie. I found it difficult to believe that Anna couldn't find help, as there are many people at the lake who know the family. Sure, it is nighttime. Sure, I buy the idea that the cell phone doesn't work properly. But I don't buy all of these coincidences together. Of course, Anna's sense of desperation that she cannot find anyone to help her and Georg is simply another aspect of Haneke's heartless manipulation of the audience, but STILL. Throw us a rope somewhere!The DVD version of &quot;Funny Games&quot; is sparse in the extras department. All the dialogue is in German, obviously, so the subtitles are greatly appreciated. The widescreen picture transfer is nice, but the only other extra we get here is a trailer. Oh well, the movie's downbeat, claustrophobic atmosphere should overcome the lack of any commentaries or behind the scenes stuff.

187414,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,1572524138,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[1, 2]","The ""games"" in this movie, are not funny. Not one whole minute of this movie is funny. It is unsettling, intense, and ironic at parts. The plot is simple. A family of three (four, counting the dog) are taking a vacation at a serene looking spot near a lake. But even during the opening credits, we well know that the tone of the film is anything but serene as John Zorn's crazy death metal blares at you all of a sudden in a creepy frenzy of buzzing guitars, high-pitched screams, and incoherent lyrics that assaults your senses! Not even ten minutes into the film, the family meets two strangers who claim to be friends of the neighbors, in which they apparently force their way into their home and force them to play their fiendish ""games.""The cast in this film is terrific! Our leads Susann Lothar and Ulrich Muhe are compelling in their roles of the mother and father forced to endure mental and physical torture from their captors. The Stefan Clapczynski who plays the little boy is effective as an innocent who is helpless to defend himself or his family. Arno Frisch is ruthless and brilliant in his role of the sadistic leader of the two, Paul (or Jerry, or Butt-head). Frank Giering is creepy in his role of Paul's sidekick Peter (or Fatty, Fatso, Tom, or Beavis). To add to the creepiness of the film, the leader Paul, occasionally shifts his glance to the camera, and either winks at it, or makes us, as an audience, participate in the film saying quotes like, ""You're on their side, aren't you?"" This approach disturbed me and actually made me think that I had no power to stop these sickos! Very few movies have that effect on me nowadays.Even though the directing is top-notch you'll encounter some slow spots in the middle of film. I found it interesting that in the most violent scenes of the movie, the camera went somewhere else, or shifted to the person doing the violence, rather than actually showing the bloodshed. So all you gore fans might not be impressed by this. The limited blood didn't faze me as much and even the subtitles seemed to vanish as I watched with anticipation of a rescue that vanishes again and again.

The intention of the filmmakers is to attack the audience for wanting to be entertained by a thriller (i.e., violence against innocent people).  The problem is, that is not a big enough idea to support this movie.  The picture has the intellectual depth of a snuff film.  This movie isn't even in the same universe with Clockwork Orange because it is all audacity, with nothing intelligent to say.  This subject matter could have been handled better in a mature film about violence (only In Cold Blood springs to mind at the moment) but this film exists within the genre of the thriller, and it does not rise above it.Even though the director shows some talent by torturing the audience in showing the after-effects of violence, what ultimately makes this movie fail as art is that he is so smug in his style that he is constantly seeking the audience's approval while simultaneously attacking them.  Characters constantly break the fourth wall, and he uses other cinematic tricks, as if to say, &quot;am I not cool&quot; or &quot;don't worry, it's only a movie.&quot;  He ends up by defeating himself: he wants to make his movie unpredictable so he simply does the opposite of what's expected.  As soon as the viewer catches onto that, he knows every turn the movie is going to make (right up to the red herring of the knife in the boat at the end).  Ultimately, the film becomes the last thing it ever expected to be: boring.

What is the best strategy overall when confronted with a similar attacker?  Do you think the victims here used any poor judgement or missed opportunities for escape?  Should they have been better prepared for such a possibility?The question of whether it inspires copycat violence is totally independent of why non-violent people might watch the movie and even benefit from seeing it.  People who are inclined to be violent and terrorize others have no shortage of inspiration or ideas for doing so.  Who cares if they adopt this particular template?  Such individuals represent long-gone failures of society and will be hurtful to others in one way or another, with or without this story to provide them with clever how-to ideas.Everyone is free to choose their own path, but I for one think it is completely naive to live life ignoring the potential perils we may all face.  Is it not a valuable exercise to mentally go through the victims' ordeal, feel the adrenaline, and imagine how you would handle the problem or avoid it to begin with?  Should we not all think about how life can go horribly wrong?  Is life well lived if one ignores the dark side of humanity?  How can we value peace and love without the awareness of evil?For a mature viewer, this movie, along with other well-executed, hyper-realistic horror films, stimulates valuable thinking -- both philisphical and practical -- about real, live evil and how me might cope with it.Personally, I found this one to be a satisfying dose of psychological terror.In the included interview, the director goes on about how he made the viewer complicit in the violence, and how the attacker addressing the viewer was so clever, etc., and while these are interesting twists, I think this film is so well executed as a mental exercise in real-life terror that the rest is superfluous.  Regardless of his intentions, I feel no guilt or shame about my intrigue with this movie -- it's utterly captivating for the thinking, feeling, problem-solving viewer.",5,"Worthwhile, Not Despicable!",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",2008,2146,"['believe', 'part', 'survival', 'instinct', 'fascination', 'kinds', 'scenarios', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'happened', 'What', 'best', 'strategy', 'overall', 'when', 'confronted', 'similar', 'attacker', 'Do', 'think', 'victims', 'here', 'used', 'poor', 'judgement', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'escape', 'Should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'prepared', 'possibility', 'question', 'copycat', 'violence', 'totally', 'independent', 'why', 'non-violent', 'people', 'might', 'watch', 'movie', 'even', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'inclined', 'be', 'violent', 'terrorize', 'others', 'have', 'shortage', 'inspiration', 'ideas', 'doing', 'so', 'Who', 'adopt', 'particular', 'template', 'Such', 'individuals', 'represent', 'long-gone', 'failures', 'society', 'will', 'be', 'hurtful', 'others', 'one', 'way', 'story', 'provide', 'clever', 'how-to', 'ideas.Everyone', 'free', 'choose', 'own', 'path', 'one', 'think', 'completely', 'naive', 'live', 'life', 'ignoring', 'potential', 'perils', 'may', 'face', 'not', 'valuable', 'exercise', 'mentally', 'go', 'victims', 'ordeal', 'feel', 'adrenaline', 'imagine', 'how', 'would', 'handle', 'problem', 'avoid', 'begin', 'Should', 'not', 'think', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'life', 'well', 'lived', 'one', 'dark', 'side', 'humanity', 'How', 'can', 'value', 'peace', 'love', 'awareness', 'evil', 'mature', 'viewer', 'movie', 'other', 'well-executed', 'hyper-realistic', 'horror', 'films', 'valuable', 'thinking', 'philisphical', 'practical', 'real', 'live', 'evil', 'how', 'might', 'cope', 'it.Personally', 'found', 'one', 'be', 'satisfying', 'dose', 'psychological', 'terror.In', 'included', 'interview', 'director', 'how', 'made', 'viewer', 'complicit', 'violence', 'how', 'attacker', 'addressing', 'viewer', 'was', 'so', 'clever', 'etc.', 'are', 'interesting', 'twists', 'think', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'executed', 'mental', 'exercise', 'real-life', 'terror', 'rest', 'superfluous', 'Regardless', 'intentions', 'feel', 'guilt', 'shame', 'intrigue', 'movie', 'utterly', 'captivating', 'thinking', 'feeling', 'problem-solving', 'viewer']",N/A
187417,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,1572524138,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[10, 14]","This film definitely breaks the conventions of horror and suspense flicks, forcing the viewer to question ideas about films and reality and even about reality itself. While focusing on a family tortured by sadistic criminals, it actually compells the viewer to become part  of the film experience, shaking up any preconceptions about what will happen next, slowly unfolding the layers of horror.  Be forewarned - the violence in this one is extremely graphic and goes beyond what I've seen in this type of film. I would say more but to do so would reveal the plot. I'd suggest not letting children see this one. It is that intense, that violent and bloody and that realistically disturbing. Call me an extremist but I wouldn't even let the teens in my family watch this one.  While Funny Games is definitely an original film in many ways and you may find yourself unable to take your eyes from the screen, you may not enjoy the experience of watching this movie and may wish you hadn't seen it. I found it uncomfortable, even painfully so, to watch this movie (and am not eager to repeat the experience EVER again). Having said that, if you are a fan of horror and suspense films and you are a film buff, you may find that seeing this is a worthwhile, if uncomfortable, experience.

187418,AQ4NJ2T9PVI3L,1572524138,"Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""","[7, 10]","I do know one thing: I've never seen a movie quite like this before. After I watched it, I just kind of sat there staring at thescreen for several minutes, not really knowing what to think. This movie wasn't really what I expected- or mentally prepared for. I didn't expect the movie to have such a cold, flat tone, for one thing. For another, I didn't expect it to be so, well, depressing.The plot concerns a family-two parents, one young boy, and a dog-have recently arrived at their summer home by the lake for a nice relaxing vacation. The relaxing part lasts maybe 10 minutes, tops. Two young men trick their way into their home and, for no apparent reason, proceed to play mind games with them, torture them psychologically, emotionally, and physically, and that's as far as I can go without spoilers. That's about the extent of the plot.Some people have said the movie is very unrealistic. Those of us who have known someone who was the victim of a motive-less homicide in their own home would disagree. I have always been extremely careful, andnever open the door of my home to a stranger. After watching thismovie, any stranger I find in my home will probably end up being beaten by a pulp and then kicked down a flight of stairs by me, even if they turn out to be completely harmless. Also, never trust anyone who is wearing surgical gloves for no apparent reason. Perhaps the only part I thought was unrealistic was the fact that the husband takes several fatal minutes to try to hear both sides of the story before deciding to do anything. Now if *my* spouse walked in, saw two men in our house we barely knew, and me on the verge of tears telling him to make them leave, they would eithe rbe gone in less than 5 seconds or something violent would occur to at least one of the parties involved.People have called this movie extremely disturbing. I'd give it maybe a 7 or 8 on a scale of one to ten, one being Ghostbusters and ten being, say, the uncut original Ilsa. What kept it from being all-out disturbing for me? Fortunately,one of the killers frequently breaks the ""fourth wall"" and talks directly to the camera. There's also a scene where one of the killers grabs the TV remote control and rewinds the movie for a couple minutes so they can change the outcome. While I admire the film-maker for being original, and I understand the statement he was trying to make with this, it mostly killed my suspension of disbelief(characters stopping the action by turning to the camera and asking the viewer a question will definitely do that).I'm glad this happened, however. Otherwise, this movie would have given me nightmares. The scene about 2/3 through the movie that people mentionas being the most shocking and upsetting was so painfully realistic I had to look away. We don't see the actual act, just the aftermath,which is much more effective. I don't think I'll get the image of Anna on the couch out of my head for a long, long time; the director shot the scene in 'real time', and everything is so still for so long that I actually thought for a minute that my DVD had frozen up.Again,I'm not really sure what to make of this movie, or even how to find the words to describe it. Usually I write reviews fairly quickly; for this one I almost felt like I was back in college trying to answer an essay question. I guess that says something right there.On the negative side, I don't like when directors manipulate the audience's emotions, especially with gimmicks. The plot is very thin, and there is no real 'climax' at the end; something happens and the movie just sort of meanders off. I also felt at times like I was being preached to.I can't really use the word 'positive' to explain the things that I thought were effective, or say that there were things I 'liked' or 'enjoyed'. This is not a likeable movie. Instead, here are the things that I thought worked well or were memorable. The acting was superb; the actress playing Anna was so good that I actually had to remind myself at times that I was watching a movie and not a documentary or snuff film. There's no score. I was never able to predict what was going to happen next. We never see the most violent acts, only the aftermath. This is not what I would call a gory movie,but it is still sickening enough that I couldn't eat while watching it. The film never glamorizes violence, makes it look cool, or portrays the slightest bit of likeability in the killers. It has the courage to be utterly downbeat and grim.I don't even know who to recommend this movie to. I'm at a loss, which has never happened before. Adults only. Perhaps people that saw Natural Born Killers and thought Mickey and Mallory were the heroes, or people who went out and bought OJ Simpson masks to wear as a Halloween costume--in other words, those who should see and consider the victim's side. I know who should NOT see the movie- those who are easily disturbed, worry obsessively about something happening to their family or have lost someone they know to a homicide, or people expecting something enjoyably spooky. If you want black humor, watch Bad Lieutenant or The Frighteners or something else. I have a pretty morbid sense of humor at times and I  didn't crack a smile once....I had never heard [before]the director's statement that people that walk out because they can't take the movie don't need it, while the people that sit through the entire movie do it because they need it. Since I sat through themovie, I really would rather not dwell on what that says about my personality and morals. No thanks, I don't think I'll go there.",4,I'm not quite sure what to make of this movie.,982627200,"02 20, 2001",2001,5597,"['do', 'know', 'one', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'quite',

Casarino,"[11, 14]","&quot;Funny Games&quot; is one of the scariest, darkest, most disturbing films I've ever managed to sit through (and I've seen &quot;Troll 2&quot;). What makes it remarkable is that it's not just an exercise in cinematic sickness, but a satire, one that gleefully and often shatters the fourth wall to show you the bag of tricks at its disposal. Somehow, though, instead of breaking the spell, the surreal and satiric moments add an intensely disturbing level of horror to the goings-on.The plot is simple - after a slow but oddly tension-filled opening (punctuated none-too-subtly by the sudden appearance of oppressive metal music over the credits), two yuppie killers invade the home of a family and systematically terrorize them. They have a secret, however - they seem to know they're in a movie. This movie, to be precise. And they know you're watching. When one of them turns to the camera, smiles, and winks - well, if that doesn't make you feel unclean, you're the wrong audience for this thing.Or maybe the right audience. The director, Haneke, is making a point here about the exploitation of violence and terror as entertainment. However, look at his past - and future - works, and you have to wonder how much of his anger is directed at himself. Haneke is ashamed and angry at his own fascination with brutality, which creates a spiral of satire and pain that makes for one of the rawest experiences you'll have watching a movie.As other viewers have pointed out, there's almost no on-screen violence. And when there is, well, Haneke pulls the rug out from under it. And yet &quot;Funny Games&quot; is remembered as one of the most violent films in recent years, which only goes to show that psychological violence is infinitely more damaging than a few rounds of squibs and a gallon or two of fake blood.",4,Brutal Satire,1077062400,"02 18, 2004",2004,1818,"['quot', 'Funny', 'Games', 'quot', 'one', 'scariest', 'darkest', 'most', 'disturbing', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'managed', 'sit', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quot', 'Troll', '2', 'quot', 'What', 'remarkable', 'not', 'just', 'exercise', 'cinematic', 'sickness', 'satire', 'one', 'gleefully', 'often', 'fourth', 'wall', 'show', 'bag', 'tricks', 'disposal', 'Somehow', 'though', 'instead', 'breaking', 'spell', 'surreal', 'satiric', 'moments', 'add', 'intensely', 'disturbing', 'level', 'horror', 'goings-on.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'slow', 'oddly', 'tension-filled', 'opening', 'punctuated', 'none-too-subtly', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'oppressive', 'metal', 'music', 'credits', 'two', 'yuppie', 'killers', 'invade', 'home', 'family', 'systematically', 'terrorize', 'have', 'secret', 'however', 'seem', 'know', ""'re"", 'movie', 'movie', 'be', 'precise', 'know', ""'re"", 'watching', 'When', 'one', 'camera', 'smiles', 'winks', 'well', ""n't"", 'make', 'feel', 'unclean', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'audience', 'thing.Or', 'maybe', 'right', 'audience', 'director', 'Haneke', 'making', 'point', 'here', 'exploitation', 'violence', 'terror', 'entertainment', 'However', 'look', 'past', 'future', 'works', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'anger', 'directed', 'Haneke', 'ashamed', 'angry', 'own', 'fascination', 'brutality', 'spiral', 'satire', 'pain', 'one', 'rawest', 'experiences', ""'ll"", 'have', 'watching', 'movie.As', 'other', 'viewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'almost', 'on-screen', 'violence', 'when', 'well', 'Haneke', 'rug', 'yet', 'quot', 'Funny', 'Games', 'quot', 'remembered', 'one', 'most', 'violent', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'only', 'show', 'psychological', 'violence', 'infinitely', 'more', 'damaging', 'few', 'rounds', 'squibs', 'gallon', 'two', 'fake', 'blood']",N/A
187422,A2E9TRM8096BXU,1572524138,"M. G Watson ""Miles Watson""","[19, 42]","According to Stephen King, scary movies fall into three categories, listed in descending order of quality:1 - Terror movies. Movies that try to frighten the audience, to put them in fear. Hard to do.2 - Horror movies. Movies that try to disturb and upset the audience with their subject matter. Not as hard to do.3 - Gross-out movies. Self-explanatory. Even easier to do than number 2.""Funny Games"", the story of a family tormented, tortured, and ultimately murdered by two smug sociopaths, is viewed by some as a classic example of number one. But it is not a terror movie at all, it is a horror movie. It does not succeed in frightening the audience, merely in upsetting them. And it is an upsetting film. Unfortunately, upsetting people does not require artistic talent. The motives Haneke may have had for making the film are of no interest to me. Social commentary....whatever. My interest is only in what is on the screen, and what I saw was a torture film, pure and simple. The film has one purpose: to hit your emotional buttons with a hammer. To do this, Haneke adds gimmicks like ""breaking the fourth wall"" and the scene where the movie actually gets rewinded by the villain so he can ""do over"" a scene where his confederate gets his with a pistol. These moments are beyond gratuitous; Haneke is putting a megaphone to his microphone, just in case you couldn't hear him shouting. This man could take subtlety lessons from Oliver Stone.Remember ""Babe"", the cute pig movie? As done by director Haneke, the movie would look like this. Babe is frisking along with his mate and piglets, minding his own business. Abruptly he is kidnapped and thrown in a meat truck, put in a slaughter pen, forced to watch his loved ones butchered, and is ultimately slaughtered himself. The last scene in the movie is of two smug butchers eating him for breakfast. If you have a shred of human decency, this would upset you. But does it require talent to make? No. And neither, in my opinion, did ""Funny Games.""",2,not funny; not scarry either,1100908800,"11 20, 2004",2004,2000,"['According', 'Stephen', 'King', 'scary', 'movies', 'fall', 'three', 'categories', 'listed', 'descending', 'order', 'quality:1', 'Terror', 'movies', 'Movies', 'try', 'frighten', 'audience', 'put', 'fear', 'Hard', 'do.2', 'Horror', 'movies', 'Movies', 'try', 'disturb', 'upset', 'audience', 'subject', 'matter', 'Not', 'as', 'hard', 'do.3', 'Gross-out', 'movies', 'Self-explanatory', 'Even', 'easier', 'do', 'number', '2', 'Funny', 'Games', 'story', 'family', 'tormented', 'tortured', 'ultimately', 'murdered', 'two', 'smug', 'sociopaths', 'viewed', 'classic', 'example', 'number', 'one', 'not', 'terror', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'not', 'succeed', 'frightening', 'audience', 'merely', 'upsetting', 'upsetting', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'upsetting', 'people', 'not', 'require', 'artistic', 'talent', 'motives', 'Haneke', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'making', 'film', 'are', 'interest', 'Social', 'commentary', '.whatever', 'interest', 'only', 'what', 'screen', 'what', 'saw', 'was', 'torture', 'film', 'pure', 'simple', 'film', 'one', 'purpose', 'hit', 'emotional', 'buttons', 'hammer', 'do', 'Haneke', 'gimmicks', 'breaking', 'fourth', 'wall', 'scene', 'where', 'movie', 'actually', 'rewinded', 'villain', 'can', 'do', 'over', 'scene', 'where', 'confederate', 'pistol', 'moments', 'are', 'gratuitous', 'Haneke', 'putting', 'megaphone', 'microphone', 'just', 'case', 'could', ""n't"", 'hear', 'shouting', 'man', 'could', 'take', 'subtlety', 'lessons', 'Oliver', 'Stone.Remember', 'Babe', 'cute', 'pig', 'movie', 'done', 'director', 'Haneke', 'movie', 'would', 'look', 'Babe', 'frisking', 'along', 'mate', 'piglets', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'Abruptly', 'kidnapped', 'thrown', 'meat', 'truck', 'put', 'slaughter', 'pen', 'forced', 'watch', 'loved', 'ones', 'butchered', 'ultimately', 'slaughtered', 'last', 'scene', 'movie', 'two', 'smug', 'butchers', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'have', 'shred', 'human', 'decency', 'would', 'upset', 'require', 'talent', 'make', 'opinion', 'did', 'Funny', 'Games']",N/A

It doesn't need funky looking mutants terrorizing a family to scare us.  Neither does it need eyeballs hanging out of their sockets to gross us out to get an effect.This movie just feels real, the actors are amazing, this could really happen to any ordinary family, it feels to real as if we were actually watching this happen before us and that is unsettling, horrifying, and almost leaves you feeling guilty as a viewer for watching.  The only other movie that left me feeling this way was Wes Craven's the last house on the left.The plot is simple enough two psychotic young men take a family hostage in their cabin.  It is the actors performances and Michael Haneke's direction that make this so powerful.  Michael Haneke who won best director at cannes for his later film cache he was also nominated for golden palme for Funny games.  This director has talent and knows how to play the audience and uses great suspense to make your stomach turn.Michael Haneke is directing the remake of his own film due out December 25, 2007 i don't know if enough people saw this original version despite the high number of reviews, maybe that says how good it is, once someone sees it they want to write about it and tell someone else.

That scene is also followed by another flawed scene involving a remote control. Now these two scenes when put together is HANEKE telling the viewer what the film is really about, but it is the opinion of most critics and this reviewer that he did not need to do that and that is why the film looses a star. So apart from this little ""strange"" element to the whole film it stands out as a film that does not depict screen violence but does depict the off-screen psychological impact of violence that a film can have on the viewer. HANEKE is a director who likes to play with your mind and here he does it like it has never been before. This film is truly original from start to finish and leaves you mortified and offended.HANEKE has made an offensive film, but it is not exploitative, graphically violent or has nudity or any other taboo element that would automatically make a film offensive. The topic of this film is Sociopaths who perform very intrusive antisocial behaviour on a family that is spending their holiday by a house near a lake. Two sociopaths entire their lives and proceed to violate their privacy and standards of community morals. This starts off by being very subtle at first in a scene depicting a man knocking on the door looking for eggs. The slow build up is extreme and you end up hating the ""bad guys"" for their stupidity and down-right selfish and ignorant behaviour. The film then becomes more extreme and the pair's anti-social behaviour develops into taking advantage of the family, abuse and even murder. Towards the end of the film the ""bad guys"" are virtually the most horrific screen duo even witnessed for their narcissism and unrelenting cruelty towards human beings. They almost appear as Nazis and you just hate them - hate them to pieces and want to see them dead. Yet HANEKE does all this to you with mostly dialogue and psychological manipulation and the fact that he is able to do this is testimony to why the man has gone on to do better things.You will not like this film, but you will enjoy the direction and how this piece of cinema has been presented to you. You will come away after it feeling that you have ""experienced"" something new and although you did not like it you will give this film every piece of credit that it deserves for doing it to you. Even the most peaceful and calm of viewers will find themselves seething in rage. Even Mother Teresa would like to wrap her hands around the villain's necks.

Apparently the ma has had enough of them, and even getting the pop to remove them won't work. How do they respond? Whacking him in the leg. WITH A GOLF CLUB.The dad COULD respond by fighting back. Instead, he just moans and groans and hugs his leg because he's so scared he's going to get killed by the evil golf club of doom. I will also point out that there are 2 bags worth of golf clubs, but the wife is dumb enough not to GRAB ONE AND USE IT AS DEFENSE.Throughout all this pointless time of fourth wall breaking and pretentiousness, the family could be responding by fighting back, but no, all they can do is weep and moan at the evil golf club of doom. The wife is forced to strip down and the son is blasted away with a shot gun, all because they couldn't do anything to defend themselves.Oh, but then the two creeps leave for a short period of time. Good, they can do something to defend themselves, right? Like, grab one of the kitchen knives, create a barricade,or best of all, GET IN THE CAR AND GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE, right?No. NO. Capital N, Capital O.Instead they spend what seems like an hour blowdrying a phone. When they can use it, instead of saying something like ""911, police!!! Two crazy teenagers are invading our home!!! Please get to (address) as soon as possible!!!"", they spend what seems like an eternity shouting ""HELLO???? HELLO????"" into the phone. And because of it, when the two psychos come back, it's back to the game.Oh, I will give the mom credit for manning up and grabbing the gun!!! Oh wait, she only shot one of them and because she apparently, for unknown reasons to the viewer, can't shoot the other, the other grabs a remote and rewinds it. I KID YOU NOT.I could go on and on, but I'm just getting angry about it. I, for once, am getting tired of movies where a group of people is terrorized and they aren't smart enough to defend themselves. Apparently this was the intention of Haneke, as he usually beats his viewer over the head with the theme because we're too dumb and can only watch a simplified story. Either way, avoid this trash.

187432,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,1572524138,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[3, 5]","Funny Games (Michael Haneke, 1998)Funny Games is the kind of movie you don't stumble across all too often-- it's the kind of movie where you have to wonder what everyone involved with the production was thinking at every single stage of the movie's development. When Michael Haneke was working on the script, did he truly think he'd get financing for what is, essentially, a plotless movie with no redeeming social value whatsoever? Did producer Viet Heiduschka think he had a snowball's chance of making any money with that movie? Did the actors really realize what they were getting themselves into? When Haneke was directing the movie, did he truly believe that a one-shot ten-minute scene was going to look like anything but filler? And most importantly, when we, the viewers, are watching and asking ourselves these questions, the most important one arises: does any of this have any effect whatsoever on the quality of the finished film? The answer to that, of course, is ""not a bit."" Funny Games is a movie that screams ""box-office poison,"" and yet it is so cleverly constructed, so blatantly hateful, so unapologetically obscene, and so technically proficient that one can't help but be wowed not only by the movie itself but by the sheer audacity of those who had the stones to make it. The viewers aren't the only ones wowed, either; the film was nominated for the Golden Palm at Cannes (beaten by Abbas Kiarostami's universally-lauded A Taste of Cherry and Shohei Imamura's masterwork The Eel) and won a special jury prize at Fantasporto (tied with Miike's Fudoh; not bad company indeed).This sick little tale takes place at the lake house of Anna (The Piano Teacher's Susanne Lothar) and Georg (The Lives of Others' Ulrich Muhe). Soon after they arrive for a relaxing weekend, with their son Georgie (Stefan Clapczynski), they are approached by Peter (Frank Giering), an obsequious young man who asks Anna if he can borrow some eggs for her nextdoor neighbor. We go from a seemingly innocent borrowing of eggs to Peter and his friend Paul (Arno Frisch) holding the family hostage, torturing and terrorizing them throughout a long, brutal night.Funny Games is not, in any way, an easy film to watch. This becomes patently obvious about three minutes in, when Haneke switches the soundtrack from soothing operatic arias to Naked City with no warning whatsoever. That's the sort of transition that occurs often in this movie, and it never stops being disquieting. Haneke's entire purpose here is to keep the viewer from getting comfortable at any time (with the arguable exception of the infamous ten-minute shot), and he does it very, very well. Funny Games is a perfect example of that odd genre of film I like to call the endurance test (this is a film you're supposed to endure, not one to be entertained by); you will likely feel proud of yourself for making it though a viewing, and will never want to see it again.

187434,A387BD735MI50R,1572524138,R. Schultz,"[0, 0]","This thriller left an impression on me. It really takes you inside the fear of a family being terrorized in their home by two psychotic youths. The movie is in German with subtitles, but I didn't find the reading to be a chore. So much of the horror of this movie depends on just watching the youths' charming, almost mincing, menace.There is one cut in the movie though that really made it a memorable experience for me. Most of the film is shot in perfectly naturalistic, chronological style. Then there comes a sudden break and re-wind. For a second, I was irritated by this intrusion of directorial artifice in the midst of an otherwise realistic narrative. But then I caught myself thinking some odd thoughts. I found myself jolted into near complicity with the psychotic youths at this point. Something in me wanted them to get on with it.And that may have been one of the major points of the movie. If you watch this film all the way through, you will see more precisely what I mean. And perhaps you too will be left examining your motives for wanting what you want to happen next at that point. I was able to write off part of my reaction as just an impulse to get something horrible over with - like actually hurrying the dentist poised with his drill. But there might have been a mote of something darker in the push I felt for the youths to wind it all down to some grisly conclusion. Some little slice of something in me was demanding satisfaction. And it wasn't comforting to know there might be that slice of darkness in me, perhaps in all of us.If it weren't for that moment, this would have been a good, but generally routine thriller - just another couple of stalking serial killers trotted out to provide an audience with some thrills. But that strange moment brings the action home to viewers. When you get to that part of the movie, see how you react.

Funny Games wouldn't lend itself to fit the ""horror"" shelves of your video library, but it's tightly wound tense scenes sport a shocking affinity to the genre. Expect to witness a chain of bloody aftermaths complete with shrill tracks of screaming from hapless victims accompanied by supposedly comical head-scratching from their perpetrators.I'd say this is the cinematic equivalent of a horrid car accident -- it is messy, violent and never something you'd want to be a part of, but as a spectre it commands an almost morbid voyeuristic curiosity that eggs you on to keep looking in awe.Unlike a lot of commentators of the film though, my somewhat negative reaction isn't based on feeling morally gyped or anything quite as magnanimous as that. I just did not think this was a good film.Haneke attempts to convey a serious message, but does so with all the shallow stylistic vacuity of any Hollywood blockbuster. Virtually nothing is done with the tableaux ruthlessness, and his entire objective with the film appears to be to play off the audience's lust for violence and anticipation. This message is clear from the start but about an hour into the movie it becomes excruciating.Those with an appetite for destruction and mayhem can watch it, it just may hit a nerve as some of the set-ups are actually quite well pulled off.

The first is the skeptical frown, because that is the expression you will keep through the entire movie. The second thing I want you to practice is a little bit more difficult. Find a spoon hand it to a friend and let them feed you with it. Got it. You are going to need practice with that because the movie spoonfeeds all the message to you with possibly less subtlety than a Vin Diesel film.The plot is simple, and on the surface downright dumb. Two well dressed crazy boys torment a family for no apparent reason whatsoever. As the movie progresses, they start making jokes, winking at the audience, pointing out the 90 minute mark and making it very obvious that this is a movie and implicating the audience and all that. Nothing else happens this is the plot. You cannot have spoilers for this movie because there is nothing else. Zero.So, what's the point? Well, I suppose the point is that people who watch movies have an obbsession with violence, torture, blood, gore, and stuff like that. Well DUH! I knew that, you knew that, the four year old down the street knew it. I suppose Haneke also wanted to point out that viewers are always trying to find retribution for the crime and that they love the revenge story and things called ethos and pathos exist. Wow, another startling breakthrough on the part of this German genius.However, this movie is effective because it forces the viewer to watch because you think that something will happen or something like that... it won't don't bother. It is also interesting because it involves the viewer more than most movies do, again... who cares, nothing happens. Sure it acheives its purpose, however narrow and obvious it was, but what movie does not achieve thier purpose save those that are downright inept?Haneke mocks everything that is easy to mock: violence, the simulated snuff film (Guinea Pig series), the revenge film (I Spit on Your Grave), the rape film, all sorts of exploitation. defenders of the genre, pretentious critics and Hollywood. Wow, tough targets.So, I sat in my chair wondering whether the best way to understand the movie would be to not watch it at all.

One of the killers talks to the audience-breaking down the so called fourth wall-in an attempt to link the audience with the violence. And for no apparent reason, the killers can also use the remote control to ""rewind"" when things don't go their way. The acting is very good.In the end though, I just wasn't entertained by the novelty or the violence. This film was tedious. While I am aware that people are tortured in real-life and showing that torture was the director's point, watching people slowly die at the hands of two characters dressed for tennis was boring. Finally, passive-agressive people annoy the **** out of me. I hated these characters for all the wrong reasons. I didn't hate them because they killed a couple of families. No, I just wanted to slap them because they were a bunch of smug little wankers. And two hours with characters that annoy the hell out of me was two hours wasted. I would have been begging these two to kill me just to escape their annoying manners. This film is a sadists dream, but it wasn't for me.For more stories about people who love being miserable, watch Haneke'sThe Piano Teacher (Unrated Edition)...guaranteed to provide you with another evening of good times.

I had wondered what it must feel like to be a victim of something like that, and this movie made the situation clearer to me. I understand that it is going to be remade in the US. The remake will probably be seen by more Americans than the foreign-language original. If it does any good, it will warn people that this can really happen, and maybe to be a little more cautious.That said, elements of the film seemed rather implausible. The sadists apparently had murdered another family just before they came to these people's ""cabin"" (actually a rather palatial mansion). Yet, the two young men had no blood on their tennis whites, and apparently were carrying no weapons!Secondly, it is hard to believe there was only one phone in a house that size. And how did the bad guy know there weren't any more phones after he put one out of action?Finally, when the little boy was trying to escape, he futilely tried to climb over the gate, but didn't think of crawling under it, although it looked like there was more than enough room.These implausibilities could easily have been avoided, and somewhat spoiled the realism on which a movie like this depends to maintain the feeling of shock and horror which the director is trying to induce.",3,The Realist,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",2007,1464,"['found', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'much', 'horrible', 'home', 'invasion', 'happened', 'country', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'family', 'was', 'brutalized', 'two', 'upper', 'class', 'young', 'men', 'only', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'survived', 'had', 'wondered', 'what', 'must', 'feel', 'be', 'victim', 'something', 'movie', 'made', 'situation', 'clearer', 'understand', 'going', 'be', 'remade', 'US', 'remake', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'Americans', 'foreign-language', 'original', 'good', 'will', 'warn', 'people', 'can', 'really', 'happen', 'maybe', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'cautious.That', 'said', 'elements', 'film', 'seemed', 'rather', 'implausible', 'sadists', 'apparently', 'had', 'murdered', 'family', 'just', 'came', 'people', 'cabin', 'actually', 'rather', 'palatial', 'mansion', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'had', 'blood', 'tennis', 'whites', 'apparently', 'were', 'carrying', 'weapons', 'Secondly', 'hard', 'believe', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'phone', 'house', 'size', 'how', 'did', 'bad', 'guy', 'know', 'were', ""n't"", 'more', 'phones', 'put', 'one', 'out', 'action', 'Finally', 'when', 'little', 'boy', 'was', 'trying', 'escape', 'futilely', 'tried', 'climb', 'gate', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'crawling', 'looked', 'was', 'more', 'enough', 'room.These', 'implausibilities', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'somewhat', 'spoiled', 'realism', 'movie', 'maintain', 'feeling', 'shock', 'horror', 'director', 'trying', 'induce']",N/A

187441,AL277B4AQCWBG,1572524138,Steven Reynolds,"[10, 12]","""Funny Games"" takes the violent thriller genre and turns it not so much on its head as inside out, exposing its internal workings and forcing us to consider what it's really about. The story premise is simple enough. A rich and likeable family of three head to their lake house for a summer break. Everything seems normal until into the house come two intruders: the flabby and childlike Peter, and his suavely arrogant friend, Paul. The young men stage-manage a small domestic misunderstanding then escalate it into shocking violence. We soon realise they have a sadistic agenda and we, the audience, are to be taken along for a repulsive but mesmerizing ride. The most generous explanation for this harrowing and at times almost unwatchable film is that it's attempting to explore the very nature of film violence. Writer/director Haneke has his villains address us directly, trying to nod-and-wink us into complicity, and his screenplay thwarts every one of our expectations about foreshadowing, thriller plot structure, character arcs, and deus-ex-machina endings. In doing so, he impressively demonstrates how contrived, unrealistic and ultimately non-frightening almost all supposedly ""violent"" films actually are. ""Funny Games"" exposes the formula by refusing to follow it.  So what?  Well, beneath the artifice I think there is a serious point Haneke is making here.  He forces us to ask some interestingly uncomfortable questions.  Are the formulaic, unrealistic, cartoonish thrillers we usually label ""violent"" really only an attempt to TAME violence by forcing it into story patterns where the innocent are saved and the villains are destroyed?  Do we watch these films because they teach us that violence has a happy ending, that the bad guys of the world always get what they deserve? Why else do we cheer uncontrollably and feel such visceral relief at the only actual moment of graphic violence in this film (all the rest happen off camera) - the one which Haneke immediately, maddeningly retracts?  Because it's the way we want the world to be, and the way Hollywood would have it.  ""Funny Games"" is interesting because it makes us consider these things.  It's far from entertaining, though, and I presume that's part of the point: why should violence be the joke Hollywood makes of it? Watch this back-to-back with something like ""Panic Room"" or ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" (or anything else from Hollywood's Yuppies-In-Peril cycle of the early 1990s) and you'll see what ""Funny Games"" is getting at.",4,"Almost unwatchable, but there is a point",1074297600,"01 17, 2004",2004,2522,"['Funny', 'Games', 'violent', 'thriller', 'genre', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'head', 'inside', 'exposing', 'internal', 'workings', 'forcing', 'consider', 'what', 'really', 'about', 'story', 'premise', 'simple', 'enough', 'A', 'rich', 'likeable', 'family', 'three', 'head', 'lake', 'house', 'summer', 'break', 'Everything', 'normal', 'house', 'come', 'two', 'intruders', 'flabby', 'childlike', 'Peter', 'suavely', 'arrogant', 'friend', 'Paul', 'young', 'men', 'stage-manage', 'small', 'domestic', 'misunderstanding', 'then', 'escalate', 'shocking', 'violence', 'soon', 'realise', 'have', 'sadistic', 'agenda', 'audience', 'are', 'be', 'taken', 'along', 'repulsive', 'mesmerizing', 'ride', 'most', 'generous', 'explanation', 'harrowing', 'times', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'film', 'attempting', 'explore', 'very', 'nature', 'film', 'violence', 'Writer/director', 'Haneke', 'villains', 'address', 'directly', 'trying', 'nod-and-wink', 'complicity', 'screenplay', 'one', 'expectations', 'foreshadowing', 'thriller', 'plot', 'structure', 'character', 'arcs', 'deus-ex-machina', 'endings', 'doing', 'so', 'impressively', 'how', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'ultimately', 'non-frightening', 'almost', 'supposedly', 'violent', 'films', 'actually', 'are', 'Funny', 'Games', 'formula', 'refusing', 'follow', 'So', 'what', 'Well', 'artifice', 'think', 'serious', 'point', 'Haneke', 'making', 'here', 'ask', 'interestingly', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'Are', 'formulaic', 'unrealistic', 'cartoonish', 'thrillers', 'usually', 'label', 'violent', 'really', 'only', 'attempt', 'TAME', 'violence', 'forcing', 'story', 'patterns', 'where', 'innocent', 'are', 'saved', 'villains', 'are', 'destroyed', 'Do', 'watch', 'films', 'teach', 'violence', 'happy', 'ending', 'bad', 'guys', 'world', 'always', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'Why', 'else', 'do', 'cheer', 'uncontrollably', 'feel', 'such', 'visceral', 'relief', 'only', 'actual', 'moment', 'graphic', 'violence', 'film', 'rest', 'happen', 'off', 'camera', 'one', 'Haneke', 'immediately', 'maddeningly', 'retracts', 'way', 'want', 'world', 'be', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'Funny', 'Games', 'interesting', 'consider', 'things', 'far', 'entertaining', 'presume', 'part', 'point', 'why', 'should', 'violence', 'be', 'joke', 'Hollywood', 'Watch', 'back-to-back', 'something', 'Panic', 'Room', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'anything', 'else', 'Hollywood', 'Yuppies-In-Peril', 'cycle', 'early', '1990s', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'Funny', 'Games', 'getting']",N/A

No. He has made one of the most effective horror movies of all time.What he is trying to tell us is that violence feels bad, a sentiment that may seem obvious, but that is often contradicted by Hollywood.  He has several tricks that he employs that draw the viewer into the film which are extremely effective.  I have read reviews in which it was stated that the intent was to make the viewer feel complicit in the violence - as if the only correct way to respond to the movie is to walk out.  I beg to differ.  The audience is abused by the film maker as much as the victims in his film.  It is truly clever and very unsettling and it makes for great horror.  He also focuses on the repercussions of violence much more than on the violence itself.  The most harrowing scene in the film is basically a long still shot across a room of a mother's intense grief.  Oh yeah, Susanne Lothar has got to be one of the best sctresses that has ever lived.What Haneke is not taking into account is that some people really enjoy a movie that can make them feel bad.  I really don't think that he knows what he made.  This is real horror.  Real horror makes you think; it gets inside you.  I enjoyed being the brunt of Haneke's joke.  I can take a joke.

Two friendly and ordinary looking young blokes dressed in white neat clothes turn out to be a pair of sick and perverted psychopaths and the sadistic molestation, tormenting, harassment and torturing of a perfectly innocent family gets started without even a tiny warning. Although we can't practically see even a one clear act of physical violence during the entire film and we spot hardly a drop of blood, ""Funny games"" is probably one of the most violent films there is. It's so overfilled with mental cruelty the pressuring anxiety grows up to be something highly enormous. For example when the torturer orders the desperate mother to undress, camera only concentrates on showing her agonized and painful crying face when she strips off.At one point the other punk even looks straight at the camera and blinks his eye - inviting the staggered viewer to join this warped madness. There are certain rules in filmmaking that ""Funny games"" breaks and that's the sickest part of the film. We are all used to the facts like bad guys can never be the victorious ones. It's obvious the audience clearly feels sympathy for the helpless family but this time mentally ill and distorted thugs are still represented as the heroes. ""Funny games"" is a confusing, shocking, curious, strong and slow but very gripping film.

187445,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,1572524138,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[3, 4]","Sick, twisted and incomparably sadistic, Michael Haneke's Funny Games is a viewing experience unlike any witnessed before. Striving to make the audience uncomfortable and as much a voyeuristic part of the violence and injustice taking place onscreen as possible, Funny Games is so appalling that it forces the viewer to keep on watching.Georg (Ulrich Muhe from The Lives of Others) and Anna (Susanne Lothar), along with their young son arrive at their vacation home to do some sailing and golfing with their neighbors. A mysterious duo of young men show up to borrow some eggs, introducing themselves as friends of the neighbors, and from there things take a sharp turn toward horrendous. Calling each other Paul (Arno Frisch) and Peter (Frank Giering) as well as Tom and Jerry, the two immobilize Georg and play a series of torturous games on the unsuspecting and petrified family.Opening with calming opera music as the family drives to their isolated house, we are quickly made aware of the drastically different events that are foreshadowed, as hardcore, screaming thrash metal music suddenly replaces the peaceful opera, and the title is introduced. From here we know something isn't quite right, and Rolfi the dog is the first to loudly alert us of the looming dangers. The neighbors act awkwardly, although it's a little difficult to tell at first, since the dialogue is all in German, but when Peter and Paul appear with odd white gloves and aggressive clumsiness in Anna's house, we know for sure that calamity waits.One of the most terrifying aspects of Funny Games is how unlikely it is that Paul and Peter so suddenly turn into villains. Neither is initially menacing, and both are young and polite. ""Why are you doing this?"" timidly inquires Georg, after his leg is shattered with a golf club. ""Why not?"" reply the boys. Is it all really just a simple misunderstanding? As Anna searches for their missing dog, Paul turns to the camera and winks. At this point the audience becomes an unquestionable voyeur to the events that follow.Turning the audience into voyeurs is both shocking and clever. As each mental and physical torture proceeds, the viewer is challenged with the idea that not only are we watching, but we're doing nothing to stop it. And what can we do? Isn't this the chief reason for even watching this in the first place? The most grotesque violence purposefully takes place offscreen, multiplying our curiosity and teasing us with the prospect of seeing or envisioning more horrors. Even when a few minutes of calm visits the living room prison, Peter watches death and destruction on the television set.Blatantly communicating with the audience, asking us questions and looking right at us, Paul continuously aggravates us with ironic speeches about preserving ""moral decency,"" and the entertainment value of moribund creativity (concerning torture). What is going on in the audience's minds as these ghastly events unfold? The usually uninvolved, omniscient place of an audience member is turned upside down. When Paul announces that they have more games to play because the film is not yet of feature film running time, it's either way too far, or just far enough, because undoubtedly we're still watching.A truly superior psychological horror film, packed with pure adrenaline-rushing terror and thrills, Funny Games is a one-of-a-kind experience. Even a scene of Peter crying because of his supposedly dysfunctional childhood rattles us as to whether or not he is owed even an ounce of sympathy. A virtually unforgettable film, Funny Games is so cleverly antagonistic, it completely redefines what it means to simply watch a movie.- Mike Massie",4,Funny Games (1997) Movie Review,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",2008,3679,"['Sick', 'twisted', 'incomparably', 'sadistic', 'Michael', 'Haneke', 'Funny', 'Games', 'viewing', 'experience', 'witnessed', 'before', 'Striving', 'make', 'audience', 'uncomfortable', 'as', 'much', 'voyeuristic', 'part', 'violence', 'injustice', 'taking', 'place', 'onscreen', 'possible', 'Funny', 'Games', 'so', 'appalling', 'viewer', 'keep', 'watching.Georg', 'Ulrich', 'Muhe', 'Lives', 'Others', 'Anna', 'Susanne', 'Lothar', 'young', 'son', 'arrive', 'vacation', 'home', 'do', 'sailing', 'golfing', 'neighbors', 'mysterious', 'duo', 'young', 'men', 'show', 'up', 'borrow', 'eggs', 'introducing', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'things', 'take', 'sharp', 'turn', 'horrendous', 'Calling', 'other', 'Paul', 'Arno', 'Frisch', 'Peter', 'Frank', 'Giering', 'as', 'well', 'Tom', 'Jerry', 'two', 'immobilize', 'Georg', 'play', 'series', 'torturous', 'games', 'unsuspecting', 'petrified', 'family.Opening', 'calming', 'opera', 'music', 'family', 'isolated', 'house', 'are', 'quickly', 'made', 'aware', 'drastically', 'different', 'events', 'are', 'foreshadowed', 'hardcore', 'screaming', 'thrash', 'metal', 'music', 'suddenly', 'peaceful', 'opera', 'title', 'introduced', 'here', 'know', 'something', ""n't"", 'quite', 'right', 'Rolfi', 'dog', 'first', 'loudly', 'alert', 'looming', 'dangers', 'neighbors', 'act', 'awkwardly', 'little', 'difficult', 'tell', 'first', 'dialogue', 'German', 'when', 'Peter', 'Paul', 'appear', 'odd', 'white', 'gloves', 'aggressive', 'clumsiness', 'Anna', 'house', 'know', 'sure', 'calamity', 'waits.One', 'most', 'terrifying', 'aspects', 'Funny', 'Games', 'how', 'unlikely', 'Paul', 'Peter', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'villains', 'initially', 'menacing', 'are', 'young', 'polite', 'Why', 'are', 'doing', 'timidly', 'Georg', 'leg', 'shattered', 'golf', 'club', 'Why', 'not', 'boys', 'really', 'just', 'simple', 'misunderstanding', 'Anna', 'searches', 'missing', 'dog', 'Paul', 'camera', 'winks', 'point', 'audience', 'unquestionable', 'voyeur', 'events', 'follow.Turning', 'audience', 'voyeurs', 'shocking', 'clever', 'mental', 'physical', 'torture', 'proceeds', 'viewer', 'challenged', 'idea', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'watching', ""'re"", 'doing', 'nothing', 'stop', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'Is', ""n't"", 'chief', 'reason', 'even', 'watching', 'first', 'place', 'most', 'grotesque', 'violence', 'purposefully', 'place', 'offscreen', 'multiplying', 'curiosity', 'teasing', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'envisioning', 'more', 'horrors', 'Even', 'when', 'few', 'minutes', 'calm', 'visits', 'living', 'room', 'prison', 'Peter', 'death', 'destruction', 'television', 'set.Blatantly', 'communicating', 'audience', 'asking', 'questions', 'looking', 'right', 'Paul', 'continuously', 'ironic', 'speeches', 'preserving', 'moral', 'decency', 'entertainment', 'value', 'moribund', 'creativity', 'concerning', 'torture', 'What', 'going', 'audience', 'minds', 'ghastly', 'events', 'unfold', 'usually', 'uninvolved', 'omniscient', 'place', 'audience', 'member', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'When', 'Paul', 'have', 'more', 'games', 'play', 'film', 'not', 'yet', 'feature', 'film', 'running', 'time', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'just', 'far', 'enough', 'undoubtedly', ""'re"", 'still', 'watching.A', 'truly', 'superior', 'psychological', 'horror', 'film', 'packed', 'pure', 'adrenaline-rushing', 'terror', 'thrills', 'Funny', 'Games', 'one-of-a-kind', 'experience', 'Even', 'scene', 'Peter', 'crying', 'supposedly', 'dysfunctional', 'childhood', 'rattles', 'not', 'owed', 'even', 'ounce', 'sympathy', 'virtually', 'unforgettable', 'film', 'Funny', 'Games', 'so', 'cleverly', 'antagonistic', 'completely', 'what', 'simply', 'watch', 'movie.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A

I can see how a lot of people would be turned off by it. I think you'd have to have a very morbid sense of humor (like me) to enjoy it.It takes place in a forested lake area, where it seems people have their vacation homes. A family, the Schobers have just moved in for the summer, Anna, George and George jr. On their first day there, a young man shows up claiming to work for the family next door, asking to borrow some eggs. His behaviour first annoys the mother, Anna. Then, he's joined by his partner, Paul, who seems to be in charge. They take the family hostage and cruelly toy with them. It becomes quickly apparent that Anna is the strongest of the family. Whatever the young men tell about themselves is questionable, even their names, since its obvious they're just lying to have fun. So you're left not knowing anything about where they came from or what they're about. Eventually it's revealed the Schobers are not their first victims...and probably not their last.Again it's not for all tastes, probably just a few. I didn't like what they did to the dog, though I was happy they did it off screen. But, all the violence to the humans happens in front of the camera. The two young men are brutal, seemingly cold blooded. But, nonetheless I found them engaging, particularly Paul (Arno Frisch). I found myself taken by the captors, then moved by the family, and then back again.
