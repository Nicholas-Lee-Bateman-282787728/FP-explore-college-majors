Charles Steiner,"[1, 1]","This documentary will make you cry when you realize what forces of mediocrity are out there to destroy children's imaginations and spirits and how one man fought to keep that creative, growing spirit alive in children such that the children did not grow up to become dunces, mediocrities, disembodied hacks who simply fill a job slot.It's very touching to see children make Shakespeare and Sophocles come alive not only in themselves but in others. The clips from actual scenes where children are acting out their parts are wonderful.Albert Cullum had his own approach to education through acting and theater. He did not follow the Marie Montessori method but I think the results were exactly as she would have wished.Albert Cullum wrote several books on how to employ Shakespeare in children's classes and they're all available, thank goodness, at Amazon.",5,How To Teach Children,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",2013,856,"['documentary', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'when', 'realize', 'what', 'forces', 'mediocrity', 'are', 'there', 'destroy', 'children', 'imaginations', 'spirits', 'how', 'one', 'man', 'fought', 'keep', 'creative', 'growing', 'spirit', 'alive', 'children', 'such', 'children', 'did', 'not', 'grow', 'up', 'become', 'dunces', 'mediocrities', 'disembodied', 'hacks', 'who', 'simply', 'fill', 'job', 'slot.It', 'very', 'touching', 'see', 'children', 'make', 'Shakespeare', 'Sophocles', 'come', 'alive', 'not', 'only', 'others', 'clips', 'actual', 'scenes', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'acting', 'out', 'parts', 'are', 'wonderful.Albert', 'Cullum', 'had', 'own', 'approach', 'education', 'acting', 'theater', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'Marie', 'Montessori', 'method', 'think', 'results', 'were', 'exactly', 'would', 'have', 'wished.Albert', 'Cullum', 'wrote', 'several', 'books', 'how', 'employ', 'Shakespeare', 'children', 'classes', ""'re"", 'available', 'thank', 'goodness', 'Amazon']",N/A

Launay,"[4, 4]","A half century ago, a brave public school teacher  (Albert Cullum) explored innovative techniques, with heart and mind, to establish a ""new way"" of teaching 5th graders.  Oh...how he succeeded.!  A marvelous film. This documentary shows how he inspired his pupils to be interested in the Great Books, in plays, in mathematics. Albert Collum insisted on tough standards but at the same time he was not afraid to make learning fun. The students compete, even dance their way to learning.  (Witness the children swimming a ""map"" of the Mississippi)  Under Collum's expert direction, even kindergarten children were starting to learn Shakespeare and to act the roles.  In a world where we are dumbing down our kids, we need to learn how to raise the standard of achievement.

His imaginative methods are revealed and discussed, as well as his impact on former students.I watched this DVD with a family circle of psychologists, all of whom were ravished by the ""developmental"" approach of the subject, Albert Collum. It was an enjoyable hour of watching, and an even more enjoyable discussion that the film provoked.I have serious doubts that Mr Collum's methods are exportable. As another reviewer with teaching experience has pointed out, Mr Collum was fortunately placed in a ""functional"" community. Here's my rap: good teaching results from good students, and good students result from good communities. I got confirmation of that opinion not long ago from Frank McCourt's book Teacher Man. McCourt was by his own account a lousy and unsuccessful teacher in challenged communities, but then became a creative comet in a privileged community.But hey, although I grew up entirely in challenged communities, I know I would have responded with joy to Collum's teaching. I wish I'd had the opportunity.I also have doubts whether Mr. Collum's methods of classroom management are reproduceable by anyone without his earnest charisma. Even good methodologies and receptive students don't ALWAYS produce good teaching. Until such time as good teachers can be cloned, I suspect to would be wise to treat them well, pay them well, and keep them in the classroom.",5,Great Students Make Great Teachers,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",2008,1478,"['Touch', 'Greatness', 'documents', '20', 'year', 'career', 'Albert', 'Collum', 'elementary', 'school', 'teacher', 'imaginative', 'methods', 'are', 'revealed', 'discussed', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'former', 'students.I', 'watched', 'DVD', 'family', 'circle', 'psychologists', 'whom', 'were', 'ravished', 'developmental', 'approach', 'subject', 'Albert', 'Collum', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'hour', 'watching', 'even', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'discussion', 'film', 'provoked.I', 'have', 'serious', 'doubts', 'Mr', 'Collum', 'methods', 'are', 'exportable', 'reviewer', 'teaching', 'experience', 'pointed', 'out', 'Mr', 'Collum', 'was', 'fortunately', 'placed', 'functional', 'community', 'Here', 'rap', 'good', 'teaching', 'results', 'good', 'students', 'good', 'students', 'result', 'good', 'communities', 'got', 'confirmation', 'opinion', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'Frank', 'McCourt', 'book', 'Teacher', 'Man', 'McCourt', 'was', 'own', 'account', 'lousy', 'unsuccessful', 'teacher', 'challenged', 'communities', 'then', 'became', 'creative', 'comet', 'privileged', 'community.But', 'hey', 'grew', 'up', 'entirely', 'challenged', 'communities', 'know', 'would', 'have', 'responded', 'joy', 'Collum', 'teaching', 'wish', ""'d"", 'had', 'opportunity.I', 'also', 'have', 'doubts', 'Mr.', 'Collum', 'methods', 'classroom', 'management', 'are', 'reproduceable', 'anyone', 'earnest', 'charisma', 'Even', 'good', 'methodologies', 'receptive', 'students', 'do', ""n't"", 'ALWAYS', 'produce', 'good', 'teaching', 'such', 'time', 'good', 'teachers', 'can', 'be', 'cloned', 'suspect', 'would', 'be', 'wise', 'treat', 'well', 'pay', 'well', 'keep', 'classroom']",N/A

Packer,"[10, 11]","I'm a high school English teacher and this film is going to change what happens in my classroom.In this film, Albert Cullum says what are perhaps the most courageous words I've ever heard come out of a teacher's mouth:  ""Day after day I was having discipline problems, and I thought to myself, 'It must be me.  I must be doing something wrong.'""As a child, my own experience with public education taught me that what was important was to sit down, shut up, and think the way they wanted me to.I was never any good at any of those things, and (now that I'm an adult with twenty years of life experience outside of education,) as a new teacher I plan to stand up, speak up and open wide the arena of the possible for ALL of my kids, regardless of their backgrounds or previous performance.If you are a like-minded teacher, this film is simply mandatory viewing.  Buy it, rent it, get it at the library; just see it soon.  It will help remind you that teaching success does not come from obsessing about what is in the way or from blaming the kids, but from ceaselessly inquiring into what is possible and making no excuses for them or to yourself.",5,What teaching success looks like,1133308800,"11 30, 2005",2005,1145,"[""'m"", 'high', 'school', 'English', 'teacher', 'film', 'going', 'change', 'what', 'classroom.In', 'film', 'Albert', 'Cullum', 'what', 'are', 'perhaps', 'most', 'courageous', 'words', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'come', 'teacher', 'mouth', 'Day', 'day', 'was', 'having', 'discipline', 'problems', 'thought', 'myself', 'must', 'be', 'must', 'be', 'doing', 'something', 'wrong', 'child', 'own', 'experience', 'public', 'education', 'taught', 'what', 'was', 'important', 'was', 'sit', 'down', 'shut', 'up', 'think', 'way', 'wanted', 'to.I', 'was', 'never', 'good', 'things', 'now', ""'m"", 'adult', 'twenty', 'years', 'life', 'experience', 'education', 'new', 'teacher', 'plan', 'stand', 'up', 'speak', 'up', 'open', 'wide', 'arena', 'possible', 'ALL', 'kids', 'regardless', 'backgrounds', 'previous', 'performance.If', 'are', 'like-minded', 'teacher', 'film', 'simply', 'mandatory', 'viewing', 'Buy', 'rent', 'get', 'library', 'just', 'see', 'soon', 'will', 'help', 'remind', 'teaching', 'success', 'not', 'come', 'obsessing', 'what', 'way', 'blaming', 'kids', 'ceaselessly', 'inquiring', 'what', 'possible', 'making', 'excuses']",N/A
875853,A19K46GITRI5Y2,B0006Z2NL8,Joyce,"[0, 0]","A Touch of Greatness is an hour-long biographical film about Albert Cullum, an elementary-school teacher whose inspired teaching methods in the 1950s and 60s were ahead of his time.  Presupposing that children are smart and eager to learn if they're given ""greatness"" instead of mediocrity, he got classrooms of ordinary fifth and sixth grade students excited about learning everything from geography to Shakespeare and instilled in them a lifelong appreciation of knowledge.The film itself is somewhat primitive black and white footage of his innovative classroom work and the projects of his students, such as a literature festival and a performance of ""Julius Caesar."" We also hear (and see in color) his grown students  tell about the profound effect he had on their lives; and we also see Cullum in action later as a teacher/educator, attempting to inspire the same passion in a new generation of classroom teachers.Cullum engaged the whole bodies of his students rather than have them sit for hours.  His students loved school.  He created a community of learners rather than a competitive contest.  The entire class learned together and truly no one was ""left behind."" The ""thoroughbreds,"" in his terminology, ""pulled the wagons.""  He put the class into teams for some projects, and they helped one another.  Most impressive were students so young discussing their preferences for either Shaw, Sophocles, or Shakespeare and seeing their productions of plays by each of these authors.Cullum was convinced that each child has his or her own ""touch of greatness,"" and he proved it with his methods.Here is a link to a 6 minute version of this film:  [...]",5,A model educator,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",2012,1659,"['Touch', 'Greatness', 'hour-long', 'biographical', 'film', 'Albert', 'Cullum', 'elementary-school', 'teacher', 'inspired', 'teaching', 'methods', '1950s', '60s', 'were', 'ahead', 'time', 'Presupposing', 'children', 'are', 'smart', 'eager', 'learn', ""'re"", 'given', 'greatness', 'instead', 'mediocrity', 'got', 'classrooms', 'ordinary', 'fifth', 'sixth', 'grade', 'students', 'excited', 'learning', 'everything', 'geography', 'Shakespeare', 'instilled', 'lifelong', 'appreciation', 'knowledge.The', 'film', 'somewhat', 'primitive', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'innovative', 'classroom', 'work', 'projects', 'students', 'such', 'literature', 'festival', 'performance', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'also', 'hear', 'see', 'color', 'grown', 'students', 'tell', 'profound', 'effect', 'had', 'lives', 'also', 'see', 'Cullum', 'action', 'later', 'teacher/educator', 'attempting', 'inspire', 'same', 'passion', 'new', 'generation', 'classroom', 'teachers.Cullum', 'engaged', 'whole', 'bodies', 'students', 'rather', 'have', 'sit', 'hours', 'students', 'loved', 'school', 'created', 'community', 'learners', 'rather', 'competitive', 'contest', 'entire', 'class', 'learned', 'together', 'truly', 'one', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'thoroughbreds', 'terminology', 'pulled', 'wagons', 'put', 'class', 'teams', 'projects', 'helped', 'one', 'Most', 'impressive', 'were', 'students', 'so', 'young', 'discussing', 'preferences', 'Shaw', 'Sophocles', 'Shakespeare', 'seeing', 'productions', 'plays', 'authors.Cullum', 'was', 'convinced', 'child', 'own', 'touch', 'greatness', 'proved', 'methods.Here', 'link', '6', 'minute', 'version', 'film', '[', ']']",N/A

875855,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B0006Z2NL8,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[1, 1]","This is a very well made documentary.  Albert Cullum was certainly gifted with intelligence, charisma, intuition, boundless energy and no small amount of acting ability which combined to make an incredible teacher.  Mr. Cullum was also gifted with teaching in Rye, New York, an affluent NYC suburb in Westchester County filled with bright, privileged children of educated parents, who did not face many of the problems the majority of children today face or for that matter what many of their less fortunate contemporaries in the 1950's and 1960's encountered.  Having talented filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. available to come up from Manhattan to film his class's dramatic productions was another gift Cullum possessed and watching the amazingly photographed acting of these young children as they perform Shakespeare, Shaw and Sophocles is fascinating.  The testimony of former students, middle aged when this documentary film was made, as to the positive impact ""Al"" had on their successful lives must have presented yet another gift to Mr. Cullum.After ten years teaching upper elementary school in Rye Mr. Cullum left to teach at the university level and write about teaching.  Granted he continued his work with bringing theater to public schools, even those schools filled with students less privileged than those from Rye. My concern with the message of this film is  Mr. Cullum's teaching methods worked for him because he was an extraordinary person with way above today's average public school teaching conditions.  New teachers who try to emulate his work in their classrooms without his talents and advantages are likely to meet disaster.  Sure almost all kids would enjoy squirming around on the floor while pretending to be swimming up the Mississippi on a giant map but it takes an extraordinary teacher to control this situation and to either refocus the students back to the more mundane learning that has to take place in school or to constantly create other lessons that are just as meaningful and exciting.  In the film Mr. Cullum says everyone has a touch of greatness in them.  I agree but that touch of greatness is not likely to be found in copying Mr. Cullum's very unique teaching talents.",4,Albert Cullum Definitely Had A Touch Of Teaching Greatness But............,1200700800,"01 19, 2008",2008,2213,"['very', 'well', 'made', 'documentary', 'Albert', 'Cullum', 'was', 'certainly', 'gifted', 'intelligence', 'charisma', 'intuition', 'boundless', 'energy', 'small', 'amount', 'acting', 'ability', 'combined', 'make', 'incredible', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Cullum', 'was', 'also', 'gifted', 'teaching', 'Rye', 'New', 'York', 'affluent', 'NYC', 'suburb', 'Westchester', 'County', 'filled', 'bright', 'privileged', 'children', 'educated', 'parents', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'face', 'many', 'problems', 'majority', 'children', 'today', 'face', 'matter', 'what', 'many', 'less', 'fortunate', 'contemporaries', '1950', '1960', 'encountered', 'Having', 'talented', 'filmmaker', 'Robert', 'Downey', 'Sr.', 'available', 'come', 'up', 'Manhattan', 'film', 'class', 'dramatic', 'productions', 'was', 'gift', 'Cullum', 'possessed', 'watching', 'amazingly', 'photographed', 'acting', 'young', 'children', 'perform', 'Shakespeare', 'Shaw', 'Sophocles', 'fascinating', 'testimony', 'former', 'students', 'middle', 'aged', 'when', 'documentary', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'positive', 'impact', 'Al', 'had', 'successful', 'lives', 'must', 'have', 'presented', 'yet', 'gift', 'Mr.', 'Cullum.After', 'ten', 'years', 'teaching', 'upper', 'elementary', 'school', 'Rye', 'Mr.', 'Cullum', 'left', 'teach', 'university', 'level', 'write', 'teaching', 'Granted', 'continued', 'work', 'bringing', 'theater', 'public', 'schools', 'even', 'schools', 'filled', 'students', 'less', 'privileged', 'Rye', 'concern', 'message', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Cullum', 'teaching', 'methods', 'worked', 'was', 'extraordinary', 'person', 'way', 'today', 'average', 'public', 'school', 'teaching', 'conditions', 'New', 'teachers', 'who', 'try', 'emulate', 'work', 'classrooms', 'talents', 'advantages', 'are', 'likely', 'meet', 'disaster', 'Sure', 'almost', 'kids', 'would', 'enjoy', 'squirming', 'around', 'floor', 'pretending', 'be', 'swimming', 'up', 'Mississippi', 'giant', 'map', 'extraordinary', 'teacher', 'control', 'situation', 'refocus', 'students', 'back', 'more', 'mundane', 'learning', 'take', 'place', 'school', 'constantly', 'create', 'other', 'lessons', 'are', 'just', 'meaningful', 'exciting', 'film', 'Mr.', 'Cullum', 'everyone', 'touch', 'greatness', 'agree', 'touch', 'greatness', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'found', 'copying', 'Mr.', 'Cullum', 'very', 'unique', 'teaching', 'talents']",N/A
