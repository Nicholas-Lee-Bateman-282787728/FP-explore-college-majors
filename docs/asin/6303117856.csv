357856,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6303117856,Annie Van Auken,"[5, 5]","Clarence Brown's charming family flick ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD was remade in1994with Danny Glover as lead. This 1951 version is superior, however.The Pittsburgh Pirates are the losingest team in American sports history. As of late 2009, they've finished under .500 for 17 straight seasons. In 1951 (the year this film was released) their won-lost record was a dismal 64-90. No wonder then that this tale of angelic intervention was so popular, especially in the Steel City!Here, Miss Leigh plays a girl reporter who blames the Pirates' dismal luck on their caustic manager Paul Douglas. When foul-mouthed Douglas starts hearing a divine voice (Whitmore) he vows to change his nasty ways if it will help the team. Sure enough, Pittsburgh goes on a winning streak! An orphan girl (and diehard Pirates fan) claims she can see angels on the field actively helping her team out. In fact, these spirits are deceased all-star players whose assistance may abruptly end if Douglas can't live up to his word.Fans of baseball history will love this picture for several reasons: it's filmed at old Forbes Field, there's game footage plus cameos of Joe DiMaggio, Ralph Kiner (who slugs a homer) and Ty Cobb (considered by many the greatest baseballer of all time). Also here is Bing Crosby (he owned 15% of the team), songwriter Harry Ruby, Barbara Billingsley (as a hatcheck girl) and Peter Graves (radio announcer). Ed Wood fave Tor Johnson is seen as a wrestler on TV.Also recommended:Another fine baseball-related film released in '51 isRHUBARB. He's a feral cat that through inheritance becomes team owner/mascot of the Brooklyn franchise. Rhubarb's presence at games proves a lucky charm for the Brooklyns.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(7.1) Angels in the Outfield (1951) - Paul Douglas/Janet Leigh/Keenan Wynn/Donna Corcoran/Lewis Stone/Spring Byington/Bruce Bennett/Marvin Kaplan/Ellen Corby (uncredited: Barbara Billingsley/Bing Crosby/Peter Graves/James Whitmore/Tor Johnson/Harry Ruby/Joe DiMaggio/Ralph Kiner/Ty Cobb)",4,"For it's 1, 2, 3 angels out at the old... ball... game!",1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,2059,"['Clarence', 'Brown', 'charming', 'family', 'flick', 'ANGELS', 'IN', 'THE', 'OUTFIELD', 'was', 'remade', 'in1994with', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'lead', '1951', 'version', 'superior', 'however.The', 'Pittsburgh', 'Pirates', 'are', 'losingest', 'team', 'American', 'sports', 'history', 'late', '2009', ""'ve"", 'finished', '.500', '17', 'straight', 'seasons', '1951', 'year', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'won-lost', 'record', 'was', 'dismal', '64-90', 'wonder', 'then', 'tale', 'angelic', 'intervention', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'especially', 'Steel', 'City', 'Here', 'Miss', 'Leigh', 'girl', 'reporter', 'who', 'Pirates', 'dismal', 'luck', 'caustic', 'manager', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'When', 'foul-mouthed', 'Douglas', 'hearing', 'divine', 'voice', 'Whitmore', 'change', 'nasty', 'ways', 'will', 'help', 'team', 'Sure', 'enough', 'Pittsburgh', 'winning', 'streak', 'orphan', 'girl', 'diehard', 'Pirates', 'fan', 'can', 'see', 'angels', 'field', 'actively', 'helping', 'team', 'out', 'fact', 'spirits', 'are', 'deceased', 'all-star', 'players', 'assistance', 'may', 'abruptly', 'end', 'Douglas', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'word.Fans', 'baseball', 'history', 'will', 'love', 'picture', 'several', 'reasons', 'filmed', 'old', 'Forbes', 'Field', 'game', 'footage', 'cameos', 'Joe', 'DiMaggio', 'Ralph', 'Kiner', 'who', 'slugs', 'homer', 'Ty', 'Cobb', 'considered', 'many', 'greatest', 'baseballer', 'time', 'Also', 'here', 'Bing', 'Crosby', 'owned', '15', '%', 'team', 'songwriter', 'Harry', 'Ruby', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley', 'hatcheck', 'girl', 'Peter', 'Graves', 'radio', 'announcer', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'fave', 'Tor', 'Johnson', 'seen', 'wrestler', 'TV.Also', 'recommended', 'fine', 'baseball-related', 'film', 'released', ""'51"", 'isRHUBARB', 'feral', 'cat', 'inheritance', 'becomes', 'team', 'owner/mascot', 'Brooklyn', 'franchise', 'Rhubarb', 'presence', 'games', 'lucky', 'charm', 'Brooklyns.Parenthetical', 'number', 'preceding', 'title', '1', '10', 'imdb', 'viewer', 'poll', 'rating', '7.1', 'Angels', 'Outfield', '1951', 'Paul', 'Douglas/Janet', 'Leigh/Keenan', 'Wynn/Donna', 'Corcoran/Lewis', 'Stone/Spring', 'Byington/Bruce', 'Bennett/Marvin', 'Kaplan/Ellen', 'Corby', 'uncredited', 'Barbara', 'Billingsley/Bing', 'Crosby/Peter', 'Graves/James', 'Whitmore/Tor', 'Johnson/Harry', 'Ruby/Joe', 'DiMaggio/Ralph', 'Kiner/Ty', 'Cobb']",Angels in the Outfield 1951 VHS

357861,A1ERNG8ZJCW5CB,6303117856,Bridget Schabron,"[0, 0]","This movie is much different than the remake.  The comical mishaps, from burnt shoes in the oven, to a coach suddenly using language learned from reading Shakespear, make this movie fun.  There are also some good moral points that families would appreciate, about there being so many different ways to express something when you're mad, other than cursing, and also different ways of handling situations.  But also, the feeling for the orphans in the movie is neat.  Overall, this is a clean, fun, romantic comedy that you could watch with your kids and not have to worry about them seeing/hearing something bad (the bad language Paul Douglas' charachter uses at the beginning isn't actually heard, just implied through certain sound effects).  And besides that, if you love a good baseball story, a good old-fashioned story, or just like the actors in the movie, you'll appreciate Angels in the Outfield (the old version).",5,Fun and romantic movie,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",2013,923,"['movie', 'much', 'different', 'remake', 'comical', 'mishaps', 'burnt', 'shoes', 'oven', 'coach', 'suddenly', 'using', 'language', 'learned', 'reading', 'Shakespear', 'make', 'movie', 'fun', 'are', 'also', 'good', 'moral', 'points', 'families', 'would', 'appreciate', 'being', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'express', 'something', 'when', ""'re"", 'mad', 'other', 'cursing', 'also', 'different', 'ways', 'handling', 'situations', 'also', 'feeling', 'orphans', 'movie', 'neat', 'Overall', 'clean', 'fun', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'could', 'watch', 'kids', 'not', 'have', 'worry', 'seeing/hearing', 'something', 'bad', 'bad', 'language', 'Paul', 'Douglas', 'charachter', 'uses', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'actually', 'heard', 'just', 'implied', 'certain', 'sound', 'effects', 'love', 'good', 'baseball', 'story', 'good', 'old-fashioned', 'story', 'just', 'actors', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'Angels', 'Outfield', 'old', 'version']",Angels in the Outfield 1951 VHS

An avid buff of Turner Classic Movies, I was still skeptical, but they simply do everything right. A great story, simply and believably played out. Lots of funny bits, not overdone. Black and white from 1951. When did we forget how to make movies like this?I wondered how they'd handle the angels. As with Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life""It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition), the director suggests their presence rather than employing an overkill of special FX. By another simple device, when Paul Douglas as the Pirate's coach cusses, his speech is garbled, an audio version of the string of punctuation marks used in comics: ""*&#!"" Why don't they do that in all those FOX TV shows? The film is also filled with cameos, and the performances seem unforced and effortless.The only reason I gave this film a chance was because of Leonard Maltin's three star review in his movie guide, in which he remarks, ""Amusing cameos from the worlds of baseball and show business."" The 1994 remake he calls ""a satisfactory entertainment for kids,"" but notes, ""the original was better"". While the story is completely different, this film reminds me of a little-seen Frank Sinatra film, ""A Hole in the Head""A Hole in the Head, also unveiled on TCM.

When the local paper assigns the Home Economics reporter (Janet Leigh) to cover the Pirates to try and find a different angle since they're losing all the time and nobody is following the team, she confronts McGovern about his attitude and he replies, 'Dogs have fleas, managers have sportswriters'. After being thrown out of a game for the umpteenth time, 'Guffy' can't find his pin and goes to look for it on the field after the game. It is there sitting on 2nd base under the stars he encounters an angel and his life is changed. No more bad guy. Amazingly the team's fortunes start to change, also. It becomes even more mysterious when Janet Leigh writes an article about a young, orphan girl who has been praying for the team. 'Guffy' wants to find this girl but Leigh won't reveal who she is. He tracks her to the orphanage and in one of the most poignant scenes in the film tells the Sister in charge that he's 'looking for a little girl'. The Sister rushes into the classroom and announces to the classroom full of 8 year old girls that a man is here who is 'looking for a little girl'. One little girl wearing thick glasses quickly takes them off and hides them, telling her friend, 'people looking to adopt don't like children with glasses'. Your heart goes out as you wonder how many times she has had her hopes up that the next person 'looking for a little girl' would pick her. It's wonderful family film with enough baseball for real fans. It has cameo appearances by Ty Cobb, Joe Dimaggio and Bing Cosby, who was part owner of the Pirates at that time.

357880,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,6303117856,Robert Badgley,"[3, 3]","Angels in the Outfield(released Oct/51)is a thoroughly charming movie directed by famed Clarence Brown,whose career went all the way back to 1920.He was said to be Garbo's favourite director(six times he worked with her)and he is tied with Altman and Hitchcock as the most Academy nominated director without a win(38!).The film stars a 21 year old Janet Leigh as one Janet Paige,a newspaper columnist and Paul Douglas as the irascible Guffy McGovern,the manager of the national league Pittsburgh Pirates.Douglas started out in the mids 30s on the Broadway stage but soon turned to radio to make his living,becoming very popular during the bigband era as the regular announcer for many bigband artists like Glenn Miller.Veteran actor Lewis Stone,whose career goes back to the teens in film(well known as Judge Hardy in the Andy Hardy series),is on hand as the baseball commissioner.Stone had worked with director Brown back in 1930 on a film called Romance.Also in the film are cameos by baseball legends Ty Cobb & Joe Dimaggio,along with the then real current co-owner of the Pirates,Bing Crosby and songwriter and baseball fan Harry Ruby. And watch for a young Barbara Billingsly(mom in Leave it to Beaver)as a hat check girl.The story centers around the rough and tumble,no holds barred and gruff manager of the Pirates,Gruffy McGovern.Needless to say,his style of managing is to swear and punch first,then ask the pertinent questions later.Everytime he confronts,say an umpire,with words that make the air turn every colour of the rainbow,his voice is heard by us in a garbled manner(actually the dialogue played in reverse).Well it seems the boys from Heaven have been watching McGovern's antics for a long time and they are fed up.One day while out on the empty field,post game,looking for his lucky charm,a voice booms out of the darkness.He tells McGovern in no uncertain terms that he has to straighten up and fly right or else.McGovern is at first not convinced of the voices origin(an angel who says he sits at the right side of the archangel Gabriel,no less).The voice/angel tells McGovern to expect a miracle during the third inning of the next game.That very third inning arrives and his players are making plays which defy logic,and is especially a 180 from their lack of enthusiasm and sloppy play of recent games.McGovern is convinced and the angels are here to stay.McGovern,and we the viewers of course,are given a tantalizing clue as to the angels identities when it is hinted that they could be former baseball players of years gone by.From that time on the Pirates are on a winning streak and eventually rise from the bottom of the league to the top.Everything would have copacetic if a certain little orphan girl named Bridget White(Donna Corcoran),from a certain Catholic orphanage hadn't suddenly started seeing the angels in the outfield...and in the infield!At first the Mother(played by Spring Byington)thinks it's too much sun and asks the accompanying sister(Ellen Corby,recalled as Mom on Little House on the Prairie) to take her under the stands briefly.When they return the girl is still sticking by her story that not only does she see angels behind all the players,but one on the scoreboard and one behind McGovern!Her tale gets passed around the stands and comes to a security guard whom columnist Paige knows.She writes about what the girl saw and McGovern goes to the orphanage to talk with the girl himself.Reporters following up the story and corner him at the orphanage,and then it starts to take on a life of its own in the media.Meanwhile McGovern and Paige have become very good friends and McGovern has fallen for little Bridget,and even plans on adopting her.The team has come down to the final couple of games which will determine who will win the pennant.However the angels story has become so twisted and out of proportion that the baseball commissioner is called in to investigate.All goes well until a sports announcer,and McGoverns nemesis throughout the film Fred Bayles(Keenan Wynn),suggests that Bridget is there to testify because she is just trying to protect her future daddy.McGovern loses it and slugs Bayles for the umpteenth time.It is this action that severely upsets the angel/voice the most and the tie is severed between the two.The Pirates will have to play the final games on their own;win or lose.The final game comes and McGovern against all opinion and his own instincts,puts in Hellman(Bruce Bennett).There is a method to the madness here.In one of McGoverns previous convos with the angel/voice it is said that they are going to be signing Hellman up for the next spring training.It is Hellmans last chance to make good and McGovern,now a changed man,is going to give him his chance,no matter what.And what pressure McGovern comes under,as it gets to the final inning,two men out and Hellman has loaded the bases.The film ends as McGovern,Paige and little Bridget stand in the bleachers looking on to an empty field speculating on just who those angels/players might have been with such names as Gehrig and Ruth thrown out as suspects(both just recently passed away).A perfect ending to this little charmer.Brown directs with subtlety and his actors really have no fillers in lines or acting.Each actor slightly under acts so what you see you feel is more geared to what one might expect in the ""real"" world.Douglas' personality change from bad to good is wonderfully portrayed and Leighs' turn as the reporter,going from her naivety about the game in general to falling in love with McGovern,is the best example of this""naturalness"" I refer to as one could get.Little eight year old Donna Corcoran's performance is also manged deftly by director Brown who extracts a subtle and well played turn from her.We never ever actually see the angels,as Brown builds their inference and ""reality"" to such a point that there is no need;another aspect that I love about this film.And oh yes,the voice of the angel that speaks to Gruffy from time to time.I listened and listened until I finally figured it out.It can't be anyone but famed actor James Whitmore(Them and SO much more).Technically speaking the film is in full frame mode and the picture is clear and crisp(b&w;).Extras include a wonderful Pete Smith short called Donkey Baseball,a Tom and Jerry cartoon,the radio show adaption of the film and the trailer.All in all a highly recommended film and a beautiful charmer that will give you that feel good feeling for a while after watching it.The film is so engrossing that I found myself rooting for the Pirates more than once,especially during the final games!A must for your film library.4-4 1/2 stars!",4,They don't

357885,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6303117856,Turfseer,"[0, 2]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I like to compare 'It Happens Every Spring' with 'Angels in the Outfield' as they were filmed within two years of each other (1949 and 1951), are both about baseball and feature Paul Douglas in key roles. 'Spring' is a vastly superior film in almost every way. The protagonist, Vernon K. Simpson, played by Ray Milland, is a chemistry professor who, as a result of an accident, gains access to a wood repellent formula which he uses to become a star pitcher. It's a great fish out of water story where the introverted professor is thrust into the gruff baseball world, and must prove his mettle amongst street smart ballplayers. Douglas plays ally Monk Lanigan, a catcher who looks after Vernon, but is constantly at odds with him since the star pitcher is determined to keep his identity a secret so that his girlfriend and her father (the dean of the school), don't find out what he is up to.In contrast, Douglas' role in 'Angels' is virtually a passive one. Here he's 'Guffy' McGovern, manager of the last place Pittsburgh Pirates, who has a chip on his shoulder. Throughout the first third of the movie, he's as mean as the film's antagonist, sports announcer Fred Bayles (Keenan Wynn) who's bitter after being canned as the Pirates' radio announcer at the behest of Guffy. Nothing is endearing or interesting about the Guffy character and one wonders why any club owner would keep such a surly person in charge of a baseball team (he's constantly berating his players after each game due to their poor play). Why is he so mean-spirited? The answer is simplistic: we find out much later on that apparently he was ditched by a woman for another ballplayer in his younger days!Unlike Ray Milland's pitcher, who must actively overcome personal demons through self-actualized behavior, all Guffy has to do is to listen to an (unseen) angel in the outfield at the old Forbes Field Pirate ballpark advise him to keep his foul language in check and act a bit more graciously toward his fellow man; in exchange, through heavenly intervention, a few of the Pirate miscues in each game are reversed, resulting in the team's sudden improvement in the standings. All it takes is a Pirate winning streak and good old Guffy is no longer playing the part of the team misanthrope. Since Guffy is transformed into a good guy so early on in the film, the internal arc (self-conflict) is resolved.Now with Guffy 'defanged', the rest of 'Angels' mainly features a polemic in favor of religion, pitted against scientific rationalism. Little Bridget White, a nine year old clairvoyant, is soon trotted out and she's the only one who can actually see the angels in the outfield. Also in the mix is the Mother Superior who's looking after little Bridget at the orphanage (the 'tough as nails' sister, is reminiscent of the nuns in 'The Sound of Music' who spunkily remove a spark plug from a car and prevent the Nazis from going after the fleeing Von Trapp family). Guffy is accused of being flat out crazy and the Commissioner of baseball is called in to determine whether he's acting toward the 'detriment' of the game. A creepy psychiatrist is cross-examined by the ever-belligerent broadcaster Bayles but both are made to look by fools when a Protestant Minister, a Rabbi and Catholic Priest testify in Guffy's defense--they argue that angels are certifiably real since they are referred to numerous times in both the Old and New Testaments.After Guffy gets into a fistfight with Bayles, the angel concludes that he hasn't quite learned the lesson of 'turning the other cheek'. They'll be no more 'miracles' for the Pirates and they're now forced to win one last game for the pennant without heavenly intervention. Guffy must now put his 'faith' in a veteran pitcher whose performance of late has not been up to snuff. Of course the veteran bears down and ends up winning the game for his fellow Pirates. One additional happy-ending: Guffy will marry newspaper columnist Jennifer Paige (Janet Leigh) and they'll end up adopting little Bridget.Speaking of Ms. Leigh, in her younger days, she certainly was most pleasing to the eyes--except here has little to do in this film; except perhaps cook dinner for Guffy and hug little Bridget, as the two cheer on the Pirates from the stands.'Angels' has only one thing up on 'It Happens Every Spring': Many of the scenes were shot at the actual Forbes Field ballpark, effecting a visual verisimilitude the latter film lacks. In addition, 'Angels' sports cameos from both the sports and entertainment worlds including brief interviews with such 'luminaries' as Joe DiMaggio and Bing Crosby.It's revealed at the end of the film that the angels actually are famous deceased ballplayers such as Babe Ruth and Christy Matthewson. It would have been nice if we could have actually seen the angels and the story would have been enhanced if they were given some kind of personality. Somehow, when we do hear the angel's off screen voice, those scenes don't work precisely because there's nothing happening that's visually interesting.A good film needs to have both a strong internal and external arc. Unfortunately, there are no twists and turns once Guffy 'sees the light'. Couple that with an antagonist who has no charm, a protagonist who early on is just as surly and a storyline that rather makes an unconvincing case for the ascendancy of religion (i.e. spirituality) in modern life, Angels in the Outfield ends up failing on both counts.Baseball is hardly the type of arena which should be equated with the world of the spirit. Despite also being a fantasy, 'It Happens Every Spring' has no illusions about the rough and tumble world of our national pastime. Why not catch it instead of the sentimental 'Angels in the Outfield'?",2,Sentimental 'Angels in the Outfield' can't compare to much more compelling 'It Happens Every Spring',1288396800,"10 30,
