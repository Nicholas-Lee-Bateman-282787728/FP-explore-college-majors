This is to save the future as those in the team must relive the past.  Space battles, mecha, androids, cyborgs, and clones are out and about 4000 years after leaving Earth.  A more realistic approach to government as gigantic battleships are owned by corporations.  The team attempts to protect a clone bio-android allowed free will to discover what it means to be human.  Self sacrifice and living for a purpose.It opens the door to a 2nd season.I liked it.  Some political maneuvering, some underlying plots, and the characters were developed with enough information throughout the series concerning their past.  Not all the heroes survive, but it gives that much more to the great story.  I minus a star due to development of the main bio android that is a weapon since the story revolves mainly around her.",4,Space Battles,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,942,"['Space', 'Cruisers', 'Battleships', '.Versus', 'ethereal', 'alien', 'beings', 'team', 'odd', 'assortment', 'save', 'world', 'unlock', 'past', 'save', 'future', 'team', 'must', 'relive', 'past', 'Space', 'mecha', 'androids', 'cyborgs', 'clones', 'are', 'out', '4000', 'years', 'leaving', 'Earth', 'A', 'more', 'realistic', 'approach', 'government', 'gigantic', 'battleships', 'are', 'owned', 'corporations', 'team', 'attempts', 'protect', 'clone', 'bio-android', 'allowed', 'free', 'will', 'discover', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'Self', 'sacrifice', 'living', 'purpose.It', 'door', '2nd', 'season.I', 'liked', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'underlying', 'plots', 'characters', 'were', 'developed', 'enough', 'information', 'series', 'concerning', 'past', 'Not', 'heroes', 'survive', 'much', 'more', 'great', 'story', 'minus', 'star', 'due', 'development', 'main', 'bio', 'android', 'weapon', 'story', 'mainly']",Xenosaga: The Animation - Complete

1198678,A1TO1P3NV7OAU6,B001GT9DU2,"KevinB ""The Honey Badger""","[1, 2]","If you've played the games, then you are familiar with the story. The anime is about as good a representation as you can hope for. The story in the game is pretty complex, and the anime stays pretty true to it. There is a lot of stuff to cover and it is hard to do it in 13 episodes. We do get a little information about Shion's past, and the whole thing with Jr. and Albedo. So the animation explains the basics. I think it should have been longer though. All in all I really like this series. The animation in and voice actors are all good. The soundtrack is good too. The quality of the game is definitely not lost in this animation. Like I said before they should have made it longer, it's an unfinished piece of work. It could have an epic feel like the game did if they made another season. Even as it stands, Xenosaga is a good anime that is worth watching.",4,As Cool As the Game...

1198679,A2QW2HL4QI4TUT,B001GT9DU2,Madeline Z.,"[0, 0]","Xenosaga is difficult to review because it has two disparate interest groups: those who want to know how the movie compares to the video game and those who want to know if it is worth buying as a movie on its own merits.  Reviewers from the first group have already written excellent reviews.  I'll address my review to the second group.In many ways, Xenosaga is a traditional anime science fiction movie.  The humans are threatened and need new weapons to counter the threat.  Their best hope is a female combat robot constructed by a woman named Shion.  Shion is pretty cute and her robot is also pretty cute.  Xenosaga has something for the boys to look at.Except for Kirsch, the characters are traditional anime science fiction characters.  The animation is very good.  There is plenty of mecha combat and subplots to hold your interest.  It has 12 episodes, which seemed right for the story content.  It's not rushed, nor is it drawn out.What makes Xenosaga exceptional is the subplot that centers on a 100-series Realian girl named Kirsch.  The issue is whether or not Kirsch possesses free will.  To find out, you'll have to wait until the end of the story.  Be prepared for a Japanese river of tears.Xenosaga is not about the female combat robot.  It's about whether or not Kirsch possesses free will.  That is what makes Xenosaga a meaningful story.  After finishing it, you won't remember the mecha combat, you'll remember how Kirsch showed whether or not she possessed free will.I recommend Xenosaga.  It was more than I expected.",5,It was much better than I expected,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",2012,1541,"['Xenosaga', 'difficult', 'review', 'two', 'disparate', 'interest', 'groups', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'how', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'who', 'want', 'know', 'worth', 'buying', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'Reviewers', 'first', 'group', 'have', 'already', 'written', 'excellent', 'reviews', ""'ll"", 'address', 'review', 'second', 'group.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Xenosaga', 'traditional', 'anime', 'science', 'fiction', 'movie', 'humans', 'are', 'threatened', 'need', 'new', 'weapons', 'counter', 'threat', 'best', 'hope', 'female', 'combat', 'robot', 'constructed', 'woman', 'named', 'Shion', 'Shion', 'pretty', 'cute', 'robot', 'also', 'pretty', 'cute', 'Xenosaga', 'something', 'boys', 'look', 'Kirsch', 'characters', 'are', 'traditional', 'anime', 'science', 'fiction', 'characters', 'animation', 'very', 'good', 'plenty', 'mecha', 'combat', 'subplots', 'hold', 'interest', '12', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'right', 'story', 'content', 'not', 'rushed', 'out.What', 'Xenosaga', 'exceptional', 'subplot', '100-series', 'Realian', 'girl', 'named', 'Kirsch', 'issue', 'not', 'Kirsch', 'free', 'will', 'find', 'out', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'end', 'story', 'Be', 'prepared', 'Japanese', 'river', 'tears.Xenosaga', 'not', 'female', 'combat', 'robot', 'not', 'Kirsch', 'free', 'will', 'what', 'Xenosaga', 'meaningful', 'story', 'finishing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'remember', 'mecha', 'combat', ""'ll"", 'remember', 'how', 'Kirsch', 'showed', 'not', 'possessed', 'free', 'will.I', 'recommend', 'Xenosaga', 'was', 'more', 'expected']",Xenosaga: The Animation - Complete
