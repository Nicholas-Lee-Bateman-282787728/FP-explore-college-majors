City of Men looks dazzling and has quite a high bitrate. Both films are pretty good but not quite classics in my book. I would think that the 9.99 pricepoint is very suited for this double feature. I really wish they could have been put on two discs but it seems they both made it out okay. Everything else seems fine to me. If you like these films or are interested in the problems presented here then it is a must buy. Stunning cinematography at times. The direction and scripts are mostly good to excellent.",5,Good transfers on one disc.,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,641,"['City', 'God', 'slightly', 'low', 'bitrate', 'low', 'twenties', 'solid', 'encode', 'look', 'touch', 'soft', 'City', 'Men', 'dazzling', 'quite', 'high', 'bitrate', 'films', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'classics', 'book', 'would', 'think', '9.99', 'pricepoint', 'very', 'suited', 'double', 'feature', 'really', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'two', 'discs', 'made', 'out', 'okay', 'Everything', 'else', 'fine', 'films', 'are', 'interested', 'problems', 'presented', 'here', 'then', 'must', 'buy', 'Stunning', 'cinematography', 'times', 'direction', 'scripts', 'are', 'mostly', 'good', 'excellent']",N/A

1660667,A1IA5XQQ9QBN63,B00DRCY8SI,Mariusz Zydyk,"[7, 7]","A short review of this double-feature release.This is a single disc release. Two features on one disc. Not two discs, as the product details suggest. When you pop the disc in, you pick which film you want to watch, and that takes you to the menu for that title.Being on one disc, don't expect a crazy high bitrate on the encode, like some release get. It is not substandard though, and my quick scan through did not identify any glaring quality problems. No film grain was apparent, so I assume it was shot on digital cameras, or at least the image has that ""non-film"" look to it, with some (re-)compression artefacts apparent in places.The movies are in the original Portuguese with English subtitles. However, the subtitles are burned in; not cool, in my opinion. -1 star.",4,2 in 1,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,774,"['short', 'review', 'double-feature', 'release.This', 'single', 'disc', 'release', 'Two', 'features', 'one', 'disc', 'Not', 'two', 'discs', 'product', 'details', 'suggest', 'When', 'pop', 'disc', 'pick', 'film', 'want', 'watch', 'menu', 'title.Being', 'one', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'crazy', 'high', 'bitrate', 'encode', 'release', 'get', 'not', 'substandard', 'quick', 'scan', 'did', 'not', 'identify', 'glaring', 'quality', 'problems', 'film', 'grain', 'was', 'apparent', 'assume', 'was', 'shot', 'digital', 'cameras', 'least', 'image', 'non-film', 'look', 're-', 'compression', 'artefacts', 'apparent', 'places.The', 'movies', 'are', 'original', 'Portuguese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'However', 'subtitles', 'are', 'burned', 'not', 'cool', 'opinion', '-1', 'star']",N/A
